                     ALmightie God and moſt mercifull Father, who in mercie haſt ordeined theſe lamps for thy choſen virgins, and commanded that with our loines girt about, and our lamps burning bright, we ſhould take heed and be readie to execute the charge, which is committed vnto vs, and watch full warilie and continuallie in our ſeuerall callings by feruent and inſtant praier for the comming of thy ſonne our ſpirituall Spouſe, ſouereigne Lord, and ſweet Sauiour IESVS: giuing vs in the meane ſeaſon diuerſe gifts and talents to occupie and imploie till he come; and ſetting dailie before our eies the iuſt iudgement, that he ſhall execute and giue in that dreadfull daie of his ſudden comming, both vpon the quicke and dead; doo thou vouchſafe euen thine owne ſelfe (we praie thee) to gird and compaſſe our Ioines about, that no iniquitie haue power ouer vs, nor we decline or bow to anie ſinne. Oh ſuffer vs not to take that contentation or vaine delight and pleaſure of anie thing in this wretched world, that may lull or bring vs faſt aſleepe in the curſed cradle of ſenſeleſſe ſecuritie: nor with the fooliſh virgins to neglect the houre and daie of our laſt viſitation, or to forget to wait and attend for thine appearing in the clouds. But ſo direct vs (we beſeech thee) in this ſhort race of our perilous pilgrimage by thy holie ſpirit our heauenlie loadeſman, that in the lawfull vſe of thy good gifts whatſoeuer beſtowed vpon vs, our cheefeſt care may alwaies be to depart from all iniquitie, and how with them wee may liue ſoberlie to our ſelues, holilie to thee, and vprightlie to the world, and thereby gaine much profit and fruit to the better increaſe of thy kingdome.
                  Moreouer, make thou our lampes to burne cleere and bright in the ſight of men and Angels; and keepe thou them light and euer burning: that our loue towards thee wax neuer key cold, nor our charitie towards our neighbour be quite extinguiſhed, nor yet our faith, deuotion, zeale, and gifts of the ſpirit be vtterlie quenched in vs. But being euermore both within and without kindled, inlightened, and inflamed by thee, which art a conſuming fire, and a purifieng flame of vnſpeakable feruent heate: let all our thoughts, words, and works be alwaies directed to doo thy holie will and righteous iudgements, that in all our works begun, continued, and ended in thee, we may euer glorifie thy holie and reuerent name.
                  Finallie, make vs verie carefullie to keepe this caſtle of our ſoules and temple of the holie Ghoſt (our bodies I meane) pure, holie, and vndefiled: and to watch continuallie in all maner of well dooing vnto the end: that when thy Sonne our heauenlie bridegroome ſhall come to iudge the world, to condemne the wicked, to reiect the reprobate, to caſt awaie the vnprofitable, and to ſhut the gates of heauen againſt all vnbeleeuers and retchleſſe virgins; he finding vs heedfull, watchfull, praieng, well occupied and readie, as thoſe that haue beene verie well content with our eſtates here for the time, and hauing our lamps filled brim full of the oile of his righteouſneſſe, grace, mercie, and merits, may (thereby onelie) eſcape the heauie iudgement and direfull doome of the dreadfull daie: and not periſh in that common deſtruction and generall deſolation of the wicked worldlings, and vnprofitable ſeruants; but be receiued to himſelfe as thoſe that are made woorthie onelie by him, ioifullie to enter with him and all the elect and choſen wiſe virgins, into the celeſtiall wedding chamber of thine eternall kingdome: there and then to poſſeſſe that manſion place, which before all worlds thou haſt prepared for thy choſen, and to receiue (of his gift) that which here now with deepe ſighes and groanes we greatlie long for: that is, euen the ſaluation of our ſoules, and the coronation of thy gifts in vs: that both with thee (ô Father) and with him thy Sonne, in the vnitie of the holie Ghoſt, we may liue and reigne in the full perfection, holineſſe and puritie of his euerlaſting virginitie, to bleſſe, praiſe, and glorifie thee, ô glorious and bleſſed Trinitie, with all virgins, angels, and creatures, by all ages, throughout all eternitie,
                  Amen: Amen, Amen.
               
               
                  
                  To the moſt vertuous Ladie and Chriſtian Princeſſe, Queene ELIZABETH, grace and peace from God the Father through Chriſt Ieſus our Sauiour.
                  
                  
                     THE King of eternall glorie, who hath thus loued England in ſetting your Highneſſe on the throne of his maieſtie to execute iuſtice and iudgement, to inſtruct his people in Iacob, and to feed his inheritance in Iſrael, be bleſſed and magnified therefore for euer and euer, Amen.
                  
                  This long and bleſſed peace wherin we your loiall ſubiects doo preſentlie liue (moſt noble QVEENE) euerie man ſitting vnder his vine and fig-tree throughout all your dominions, dooth giue iuſt occaſion to the godlie to bee no leſſe thankfull to God, and to your Maieſtie, than free harted and ſtudious to benefit his church and their countrie, by offering in the temple, ſome gold, ſome ſiluer, ſome one thing, ſome another, according to the meaſure of thoſe graces, which God the giuer of all good things hath beſtowed vpon them, or by his ſpirit hath incouraged & made them willing to further the worke of the Lord. Which mooued me alſo among the reſt (although of all other the meaneſt, & in euerie reſpect the vnwoorthieſt) to offer ſome thing, wherin I might bring profit to that myſticall bodie, wherof I truſt I am a member. And perſuading my ſelfe, I could not better employ my labour to the good of the church, nor preſent your Highneſſe the mightie defender thereof, with anie thing of greater price and eſtimation in this world, than (after a ſort) with that wherewith God the King of kings acknowledgeth himſelfe to be ſo highlie pleaſed and glorified both of Prince and people (praiſe and inuocation I meane) whereby in this life we obteine at his hand all things needfull for our bodies, and in the life to come euerlaſting ioie, reſt, and comfort both of bodie and ſoule: I haue vndertaken in the name and feare of God, loue of his church, obedience of your Maieſtie, and hartie

good will of my countrie, out of the admirable monuments of your owne Honourable works, and ſome other noble Queenes, famous Ladies, and vertuous Gentlewomen of our time, and former ages, to addreſſe and make readie theſe ſeuen Lamps of your perpetuall virginitie, to remaine vnto women as one entire and goodlie monument of praier, precepts, and examples meet for meditation, inſtruction, and imitation to all poſteritie. And now in moſt dutifull maner commending and appropriating ſo diuine exerciſes of the church, vnto your Maieſtie the moſt naturall mother and noble nurſſe thereof; the cauſe of a virgine to a Virgine, the works of Queenes to a Queene; your owne praiers to your ſelfe (to whom indeed the particular intereſt and due praiſe and honour thereof iuſtlie belongeth) I here proſtrate on my knees, in moſt humble maner meekelie beſeech your excellent Maieſtie, gratiouſlie of your woonted clemencie, to pardon and forgiue this my too raſh and bold enterpriſe; attempted both with baſhfulneſſe, feare, and trembling: and fauourablie (as in like caſes you are accuſtomed) to accept theſe your liege ſubiect his great labors and painfull trauels in good part, which he (not to inſtruct your Highneſſe (of whoſe notable learning I am not able to ſpeake) but onelie for a monument of the hartie loue he beareth both to the church his deere mother, and to your Maieſtie his dread Souereigne) hath in a godlie zeale and conſcience, beſtowed to the good and profit of his countrie. That (by your Graces good liking and princelie approbation) they may be both patronized againſt the wicked, and practiſed of the godlie. And ſo manie (by that means) with due reuerence and great honour to ſo honourable works, may receiue theſe lamps as from your bountifull hand to inlighten them by your good induſtrie in all vertue: and to prepare them by your holie example, like wiſe virgins to perſeuerance in all good works of the ſpirit. And that therein manie may often looke and labour mightilie for your Highneſſe as they are bound, in feruent praier; and manie mo thanks, I ſaie, be giuen of manie faithfull harts on your Maieſties behalfe for the benefit of ſuch and ſo manie needfull and readie helps, miniſtred and afoorded by your painfull hand and princelie affabilitie to your euerlaſting comfort and renowme, the praiſe of God, and glorie of his deereſt ſonne Ieſus Chriſt your ſweet ſpouſe. Whom now for a concluſion as I began, I moſt entirelie beſeech, that as of his owne good will he firſt loued his church my deere mother, and gaue himſelfe freelie for hir to ſanctifie and clenſe hir in the moſt holie fountaine of water, through the word to make hir vnto himſelfe a beautifull virgine, and glorious ſpouſe without ſpot or wrinkle, that ſhe ſhould be holie, pure, perfect, and without blame before him: ſo he will vouchſafe in like mercie, ſtill both to cheriſh, defend, and maintaine the ſame in his continuall grace, religion, and holineſſe, that ſhe may yet bring foorth more fruit in hir age, and members, to his glorie: and alſo as your ſpirituall ſpouſe to ſet your Maieſtie (a moſt woorthie and mightie gouernor of the ſame) euer as a ſeale vpon his hart, to tie you faſt as a ſignet or bracelet vpon his arme, to beare you ſtill in his owne boſome, to ſet his eie ouer you continuallie for your health, wealth, and proſperitie, to bend his deſires alwaies towards you, to doo you good; that ſo your Highneſſe may be kept in his continuall grace, peace, and fauour long to reigne ouer vs: and alſo defended and preſerued euermore from all bodilie and ghoſtlie perils and enimies, to your euerlaſting comfort, and the reioice of all chriſtian harts. Finallie, the Lord bleſſe your Maieſtie euen out of Sion with all his heauenlie gifts and ſpirituall graces, that hauing the principall & heroicall ſpirit of your holie father

good king Dauid, doubled (yea trebled) in your noble and princelie hart, you may as in numbers of yeeres beyond manie ages, ſo in ſingular pietie and godlines far ſurmount & excell your moſt noble progenitors: that the remembrance of you our good Ioſias, may to all poſterities be like the compoſition of the moſt pretious perfume of the Apothecarie, and as ſweet as honie in all mouthes, and as harmonicall muſicke at a banket of wine; that in you our zealous Hezechias, I ſaie, we may ſtill remaine in happie peace, and haue an hiding place from the wind, and a refuge from ſtorms and tempeſts, and riuers of waters to quench our thirſt, and temperate ſhadowes to ſhrowd vs from parching heate in a drie land: ſo ſhall the harts of manie thouſand virgins in England and elſe-where, be ioifull and thankfull to God and your Maieſtie; ſo ſhall the daughters of Ieruſalem ſing ioifullie the ſweet ſongs of Sion in their owne land, with great triumph to their celeſtial King, reigning on high ouer all; yea ſo ſhal all your faithfull and louing ſubiects, I ſaie, in all humble obedience and dutifull ſeruice both towards God, your Maieſtie, and their countrie, reſound by all poſſible meanes to all poſterities your moſt excellent and woorthie praiſes, vntill the comming of our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt: to whom with the Father and the holie Ghoſt be all empire, honor, dominion and praiſe, now and for euer,
                  Amen.
                  
                     Your Maiesties humble, faithfull, and obedient ſubiect,

                  To the Chriſtian Reader, grace and truth in Chriſt.
                  
                     HAuing my ſelfe taken no ſmall comfort (good Chriſtian Reader) by the reading and pervſing of diuers verie godlie, learned, and duiine treatiſes, of meditations and praier, made by ſundrie right famous Queenes, noble Ladies, vertuous Virgins, and godlie Gentlewomen of al ages (who to ſhew themſelues woorthie paternes of all pietie, godlineſſe, and religion to their ſex, and for the common benefit of their countrie, haue not ceaſed, and that with all carefull induſtrie and earneſt indeuour, moſt painfullie and diligentlie in great feruencie of the ſpirit, and zeale of the truth, euen from their tender & maidenlie yeeres, to ſpend their time, their wits, their ſubſtance, and alſo their bodies, in the ſtudies of noble and approoued ſciences, and in compiling and tranſlating of ſundrie moſt chriſtian and godlie bookes: a taſt whereof you haue here in the ſecond Lampe) as namelie among the reſt, the godlie and learned treatiſe called The lamentation of a ſinner, written long ſince by the vertuous Ladie Queene Katherin, which for the excellencie thereof was firſt publiſhed in print by Sir William Cicill, now the right Honourable Lord Treaſurer of England, as by his verie godlie, learned, and eloquent Epiſtle therevnto prefixed, and here alſo in this edition now inſerted, to Gods glorie, and his high commendation doth and may appeere: but eſpeciallie and aboue all, the moſt diuine, learned, and godlie treatiſe intituled The Queenes meditation, written firſt in French by the vertuous Ladie Margaret Queene of Nauar, and after verie exactlie and faithfullie tranſlated by our moſtgratious ſouereigne, and learned Ladie Queene ELIZABETH, who among manie Queens, virgins, and women, through the feare of the Lord hath doone verie vertuouſlie, and gotten thereby great renowme. And therevpon conſidering with my ſelfe what great profit, and ſingular pleaſure might thereby come alſo to other of like mind to my ſelfe, if the ſame their excellent and rare works (diſperſed into ſeuerall pamphlets, and in part ſome thing obſcured and worne cleane out of print, and ſo out of practiſe) were by ſome painefull hand collected togither, and reuiued, or brought againe to their former good and godlie vſe in the church: mee thought I could not better ſpend my time, nor emploie my talent, either for the renowme of ſuch heroicall authors and woorthie women, or for the vniuerſall commoditie of all good chriſtians: than in, and by ſome apt treatiſe or collection, to reduce theſe their manifold works into one entire volume, and by that meanes, for to regiſter their ſo rare and excellent monuments, of good record, as perfect preſidents of true pietie and godlineſſe in woman kind to all poſteritie. Wherevpon, God working in me both the will and conſent, I vndertooke the ſame in his feare: which when after a ſort I had doone, and perceiued that there wanted per manie things to make the ſame an abſolute and perfect booke for the ſimpler ſort of women, according to my mind: to ſatiſfie my ſelfe further in this my purpoſed collection, I fell to the pervſing of the holie Bible, and manie other good bookes as well of praier, as of other diuine matter, ſuch as from time to tune haue beene penned by diuers godlie learned men: out of the which (that I might now particularlie applie that vnto them, women I meane, which generaliſe hereto fore was written of them, or by ſome other, for them, as alſo to the inter & that all godlie and deuout women readers might haue in ſome meaſure, wherewith to exerciſe their faith; to ſtir vp their deuotion, and to ſatiſfie their godlie deſires: and alſo verie readilie find without tediouſneſſe, or diſtraction of the mind vertuouſlie inclined, whatſheuer

they would either by praier aſke, by meditation ponder, by precepts learne, or by examples imitate, or auoid to their comfort & edification) I indeuoured for their ſakes, by all poſſible diligence, to cull and bring out of the rich ſtore and treaſurie of the approoued works of manie learned men, things both old and new concerning the ſame, both for priuate and publike vſe, adding therevnto ſuch plentie of heauenlie and ſpirituall helpes, both for profit and pleaſure, as the diuerſities of ſo diuine matter, and varietie of ſo honourable inuentions would affoord. Beſides, to auoid confuſion and diſorder (a thing verie preiudiciall to ſo holie an exerciſe) I haue carefullie digeſted the ſame into ſuch a plaine, eaſie, familiar, and certeine method, order, and direction, both for matter and maner, as I could poſſiblie deuiſe. or was requiſite for ſuch a worke, to make it profitable to the ſimple and vnlearned reader. Laſtlie, bicauſe the diuerſitie of matter forced a diſtinction of the treatiſes, I fitly, as I could, haue diuided and contriued the whole booke into ſeuen ſeuerall parts or Lampes: all which for diuers good and approoued conſiderations I terme or intitle by this generall name, THE MONVMENT OF MATRONES. And now make bold, yet vnder the deliberate view, and carefull correction of manie vevie graue, wiſe, learned, and godlie Diuines, therevnto appointed by authoritie: as alſo with the approbation and allowance of the right reuerend father in God my Lord the biſhop of London, to publiſh the ſame abroad in print, as a booke, in the iudgement of them that are learned, not vnprofitable to the church: but verie neceſſarie, and in ſome reſpect, more proper and peculiar for the priuate vſe of women, than hertofore hath beene ſet out by anie. Which I haue doone not for that there lacked praier bookes ſufficient for women to read, but onelie to increaſe the plentie of heauenlie comforts, wherewith this our church and realme of England (thanks be to God) floweth: as alſo to make this treatiſe heretofore (in part) priuate to my ſelfe, and a few of my freends, now publike and common alſo to you good chriſtian readers. For behold (I proteſt) I haue not laboured for my ſelfe, but for you, and all them that ſeeke knowledge, feare God, be deuout, and would (not by fits and ſtarts, as thoſe that can find ſcarſe anie leiſure to attend vpon the Lord and his ſeruice as they ought: but) daie and night continuallie and inceſſantlie, either ſilentlie in hart with Hanna, or openlie in mouth with Marie, as they are bound, ſpend their whole life, and make it their whole worke to praie, meditate, and read Gods word with other ſuch good bookes, or at the leaſt to allow to themſelues ſome little portion or part of the daie and night, to proſtrate themſelues apart from all companie in praier and meditation before the Lord of heauen and earth their creator, redeemer, and ſauiour, and that in all chriſtian perfection, and humble obedience to his word and commandements. So haue you good reader, by the goodneſſe of God, who worketh all our works for vs, here now at the length in this Monument or collection conteined (if you liſt ſo for diſtinction or names ſake to call or intitle them) not onelie a burning Lampe for virgins, but alſo a chriſtall Mirrour for Matrones: as alſo a delectable Diall for to direct you to true deuotion, with a perfect Preſident or regiſter of holie praier for all women generally to haue recourſe vnto, as to their homelie or domeſtical librarie.
                  Firſt, a Lampe, readie repleniſhed and prepared of the wiſe virgins, with that fragrant oile, pretious perfume, and odoriferous incenſe of holie inuocation, pure praier, diuine ſacrifice, and heauenlie worſhip, wherewith God is ſo highlie pleaſed and whereby at his holie hand the virgine or ſingle woman, through the interceſſion of Chriſt, obteineth the gift of puritie, modeſtie, ſhamefaſtneſſe, and chaſtitie: the deflowred woman findeth grace to repent, and to be reſtored to fauour both with God and men: the naturall or ſtepdaughter to reuerence and obeie hir parents in all childlike duties: the wooed woman not to be by anie meanes coſined or abuſed in marriage: the yoong married wife to conſecrate hir ſelfe to liue holilie in that honourable eſtate: the elder married woman, to liue louinglie, faithfullie, and quietlie with hir huſband: the woman with child, to eſcape the pit of ſo great perils, and to be thankfull for hir mightie deliuerance after childbirth: the midwife, and women aſſiſtants, dutifullie and diligentlie to aid, comfort, and cheriſh the trauelling woman: the mother carefullie to bring vp hir children: the daughter naturallie to cheriſh and obeie hir mother: the mother in lawe, to liue charitablie and louinglie with the daughter in lawe: againe, the daughter in lawe to be haue hir ſelfe chriſtianlie and curteouſlie to the mother in

lawe: the dame or miſtreſſe, to intreate hir handmaids well: the handmaids to ſhew all dutifull and faithfull ſeruice to their miſtreſſe: the widowe, to comfort hir ſelfe in all ſorrowes: the old woman to number hir daies, that ſhe may applie hir hart vnto wiſedome: both yoong and old, one and other to conſider their creation, condition, vocation, and ſaluation, the better to liue to learne, to learne to liue, and to liue to die. To conclude, a Lampe (I ſaie) for all eſtates and degrees of women generallie, to carrie euer in their hands and hart by the burning light and flaming fire of the reading whereof, their faith, knowledge, zeale, deuotion, perſeuerance in praier, almes deeds, faſting, with the loue of God and their brethren, the deſire of vertue, and all maner of godlineſſe ſhall be thoroughlie kindled and increaſed in them, ſo oft as they war cold, heauie, drowſie, ſlouthfull, dull, negligent, and remiſſe, by too much bodilie eaſe, worldlie proſperitie, vaine pleaſures, pomps, and delights of this wretched life: and they at all times made readie, like wiſe and prudent virgins, to meet the bridegroome whenſoeuer he commeth, to be receiued of him, and to enter with him ioifullie into the celeſtiall wedding chamber of his eternall happineſſe, there to glorifie and praiſe him for euer and euer.
                  Secondlie, a Mirrour for all ſorts of wicked women, as in a cleere glaſſe with Athalia, Iezabell, Herodias, and ſuch like, perfectlie to ſee their ſhameleſſe pride, crueltie, idolatrie, and contempt of religion, with Putiphers wife, to behold their incontinencie and infidelitie towards their huſbands: with Appam their ſhameleſſe impudencie: with Cozbi, their manifeſt whoordomè and adulterie: with the witch of Fndor, their abhominable ſorceries: with Queene Daſthy their diſobeence to their ſouereigne: with Bethſhemah and Iudith their rebellious ſtubborneſſe to their louing parents in lawe: with Hagar their contempt of their miſtreſſe: with Miviant their murmuring againſt their onelie brother: with Heua their ſubtiltie and couetouſnes to beguile their huſbands: with Zipporah, Michol, Iobs wife, old Anna, Tobit, &c. their vnſemelie vpbraidings and bitter taunting, or chiding of their godlie huſbands, &c. leaſt that for their great impietie and vngodlineſſe with Queene Maacha, they be depoſed from their ſeate of maieſtie: or with Baara, and Q. Daſthy, they be diuorced from their huſbands: or with Athalia, they be ſlaine without the temple: or with Cozbi, be thruſt through with a ſword, or with Iezabel, in all their brauerie they be throwne headlong downe into the ſtreet out of their owne windowe, and be eaten and deuoured of dogs, and ſo want the honour of chriſtian buriall: or with Saphyra be ſtriken with ſudden death at the Apoſtles feete: or with the Leuites wife be ſhamefullie abuſed to death, and after chopt in peeces: or with Samſons wife be burnt to aſhes in the houſe where they dwell: to conclude, leaſt with the whoore of Babel they be caſt quicke into the bottomleſſe pit of perdition: or with the flue fooliſh virgins they be ſhut cleane out of heauen, and go aliue downe into hell, there to be damned for euer, if in time they call not for grace to beware and repent them of their former wickedneſſe. Againe, a Mirrour contrariwiſe for all godlie and vertuous women plainlie to behold the faith, religion, modeſtie, ſobrietie, ſinceritie of life and conuerſation of Sara, Ruth, Q. Candaces, Bernice, Suſanna, Elizabeth, the bleſſed virgine Marie, &c. The holineſſe, deuotion, feare of God, iuſtice, vprightneſſe, &c. of Hanna, Q. Heſter, &c.

The ſore labour and paines taking to get their owne liuing, of Anna Tobit, Lydia, Naomy, Ruth, Dorcas, &c. Finallie the admirable humilitie, and inuincible patience and conſtancie in all aduerſities and perſecution euen to the death and martyrdome, of Iepthas daughter, Suſanna, the mother of the ſeuen brethren, and women of the Machabites, and manie other: that looking in this glaſſe of the holie liues of their foremothers, they may chriſtianlie conforme and adorne themſelues after their good examples, and become for their rare vertues verie beautifull ſpouſes in the fight of their ſpirituall bridegroome Ieſus Chriſt: to whom, as the kings daughters, they may appeere all glorious within, and of whom with the lambes wife they may be marked in the forehead with the teſtimonie of his name Ieſus, to the end that being clothed with the ſunne of righteouſneſſe, and crowned with the twelue ſtars of God and his word, and treading the moone of this worldlie affections vnder their feet, they may euermore be deliuered by him their valiant Michael, and his angels from the power of the red dragon, which ſo greedilie gapeth to deuoure them: and poſſeſſe their ſoules in patience, in the reſtfull place of the preſence of God, long ſince prepared for the elect where they ſhall be nouriſhed and preſerued for time & times, and together with all holie virgins, matrones, martyrs, and elect people of God, ioifullie triumph and be glad for the gift of their euerlaſting happineſſe.
                  Thirdlie, a Diall of deuotion to direct you by the glorious globe and ſhine of the bright ſunne of righteouſneſſe, which inlighteneth all things in the world, verie readilie and plainlie at all feaſts and ſeaſons of the yeere, and at all houres and times of the daie and night continuallie vnto the holie mount of heauenlie contemplation and to the chriſtian meditation and conſideration of euerlaſting felicitie in celeſtiall things, the better to contemne and forget all terrene, baſe, vile, momentanie, and earthlie vanities.
                  Fourthlie and laſtlie, a domeſticall librarie plentifullie ſtored and repleniſhed both of the beſt approoued preſidents of chriſtian praiers and diuine meditations, made from time to time by manie right godlie authors, men and women of all ages: and alſo of the choſen ſentences or perfect precepts of holie ſcripture concerning the chriſtian duties of all degrees and eſtates of women in their ſeuerall callings, together with the pleaſant hiſtories and memorable acts, liues, and death of all maner of women good and bad, by name or without name, mentioned in the old and new teſtaments of the bible, where among, for the better vnderſtanding of the text, I haue inſerted ſome notes out of the Geneua bible with ſome difference by parentheſis, verie neceſſarie for the ſimple reader. All which treatiſes, though not ſo portable, yet ſo delectable, profitable, and readie prepared to lie in your ſecret chamber or oratorie to vſe: howſoeuer intituled or called, God grant they may as diligentlie be read and fruitfullie practiſed of you, good readers, as they and euerie of them (I am ſure) were painfullie compiled and faithfullie purpoſed of the authors. And for theſe, and all other ſuch good helpes and furtherances to faith, deuotion, and godlineſſe, God make both you and me alwaie thankfull vnto his maieſtie, who by all meanes, at all times, and through all ages, moſt gratiouſlie vſeth both the miniſterie of men and angels, to doo vs good continuallie, that through our vnthankfulneſſe and wilfull contempt of his good gifts and graces dailie offered by ſo manie high, learned, and painfull hands, we may not looſe the ſame and the profit thereof, by loathing that, which we ought moſt to loue and imbrace, but rather in good time by our grateful acceptation and approbation of that which deſerues good liking, gaine to ourſelues comfort and conſolation, and encourage others (which as yet of anie ſingular affection for their priuate vſe conceale or deteine the woorks of anie godlie authors men or women) to take good opportunitie by this occaſion offered euen for the common benefit of Chriſts congregation, to publiſh the ſame abroad, for the perfection of this good worke, to the glorie of God, and the authors euerlaſting praiſe and commendation both with God and men: that full deſeruedlie it may be ſaid of them, as moſt woorthilie it is of theſe my right chriſtian and heroicall authors.

                        Etſi mors indies accelerat,
                        Viuit tamen poſt funera virtus.
                     
                     
Thus being awaked vp laſt of all as one that gathereth after them in the vintage, I haue laboured as you ſee (good reader) like a poore gleaner or grape gatherer with reſtleſſe Ruth to go after the maidens in the harueſt, and to gleane and gather for my mother Naomi certeine handfuls of corne, after the reapers and painfull labourers among the ſheaues, let fall of deuotion in the fruitfull feelds of charitable Boaz: and haue aſſailed, as you well perceiue, to repleniſh my wine preſſe with the grapes of the Lords plentifull vintage, and to fill my lampes brimfull with the oile of Gods good bleſſing and rich ſtore, left behind by the wiſe virgins in the holie veſſels of his increaſe. Here therefore if I might be ſo bold without offenſe, as in the name of the foreſaid bleſſed Boaz, I would gladlie exhort and perſuade Ruth, and in hir all other godlie women of the ſimple ſort, to followe this his good counſell (who ſaith: Heare me, my daughter, and go to none other feeld to gather, neither depart from hence to gleane, but abide here by my maidens, let thine eies be on the feeld that they doo reape in, and go thou after the maidens: and when thou art athirſt go alſo to the veſſels, and drinke of that which the ſeruants and handmaids haue drawne, and when thou art hungrie, come hither and eate of the bread, and dip thy morſell in the vineger, and ſit by the reapers, and thou ſhalt be ſatiſfied to the full.) So now leaſt you ſhould gather by anie method, order, diuiſion, title, direction, or application, that you ſhall find in this booke, or anie part therof, that I go about nicelie, curiouſlie, or ſtrictlie to inioine you to obſerue hours, daies, feaſts, times, or ſeaſons, or to bind you vnlawfullie to an impoſſibilitie, as of neceſſitie to vſe all or euerie of theſe praiers and meditations, in place, maner, and forme as they are ſet downe (although it is to be wiſhed that for the moſt part they might, if it were poſſible, or the neceſſities of this turbulent life would permit) that you ſhould not miſtake me, I ſaie, and iudge that my purpoſe is in anie reſpect to hinder common praier, or interrupt the miniſtration of the word and ſacraments in the church, where & at what time I knowe we ought all to glorifie God together with one hart, ſpirit, and mouth, and to be no otherwiſe occupied, either in reading or in praieng, than the publike miniſter is, vnleſſe we would be deemed meere ſuperſtitious, and vnder the pretenſe of ſeuerall deuotion to commit manifeſt vngodlineſſe: I thinke it verie neceſſarie for me to let you vnderſtand (gentle reader) that my meaning herby was and is, ſimplie firſt to plaie the part of a faithfull collector, by following my copies trulie, and placing their works and praiers together as I found them referred by the authors for priuate or publike vſe: ſecondlie, for order and memorie ſake, after the good example of the learned fathers of our time, to intitle, reduce, and applie thoſe other godlie meditations and praiers, which for the matter I found woorthie the more often vſe in the church, or elſewhere, vnto ſome more ſpeciall place, apt time, and peculiar purpoſe, than heretofore (to my knowledge) by anie others haue beene intituled, referred, or applied. But thirdlie and principallie by the meanes of ſome plaine forme and eaſie method of praier and meditation, to prepare for the vnlearned at all times, and in all places ſuch and ſo manie ſorts, as to auoid ignorance and tediouſneſſe might conuenientlie ſerue to further their godlie deſires, to the glorie of God, the confuſion of ſathan, and their owne eternall comfort in Chriſt Ieſus: referring them notwithſtanding, which you ſhall find proper for the church to be vſed there onelie at conuenient times by the ordinances of the church lawfullie permitted: the reſt which are more priuate to be vſed elſewhere at your diſcretions, when and ſo often as opportunitie ſhall ſerue, and Gods ſpirit by his heauenlie motion giue you anie occaſion. For as I would not haue you thinke hereby, that I my ſelfe doo in all reſpects obſerue this order here preſcribed (although I aſſure you I ſtriue to doo it either within booke or without: and repent from the bottome of my hart the often omiſſion of it in times paſt) ſo I wiſh you good readers, which chriſtianlie haue conſecrated and vowed to giue your ſelues to this holie exerciſe (as the Lord, I ſaie, in mercie ſhall giue you grace, leiſure, time, and occaſion, and not ſuffer you to be tired with anie worldlie neceſſitie) in the name and feare of God, to obſerue this or that order, method, forme, or direction, which he in his word dooth allow of, or you knowe beſt will keepe you in the continuall faith, feare, and fauour of God.
                  For truſt me, if you will but a little together with me call theſe ten memorable things to your chriſtian remembrance in this ſo holie an exerciſe. Firſt, the  commandements of almightie God himſelfe, whom in conſideration of our owne

great miſerie and neceſſitie, and common lacke of the chriſtian congregation, hath willed vs to call vpon him, ſaieng: Praie alwaies with all maner of praiers and ſupplications in the ſpirit, and watch therevnto with all perſeuerance. Secondlie, his moſt ſweet and  comfortable promiſes made gratiouſlie both to heare and grant our godlie and lawfull requeſts, ſaieng: Aske, and ye ſhall haue; ſeeke, and ye ſhall find; knocke, and it ſhall be opened vnto you: for euerie one that calleth vpon the name of the Lord, and departeth from iniquitie, ſhall be ſaued, &c. Thirdlie, our great and manifold ſinnes, whereof we are guiltie, which will not ſuffer vs to ſit ſtill without care, but briueth vs of neceſſitie to beg  his moſt gratious pardon. Fourthlie, our feeble fleſh and weake nature vnable in euerie reſpect to doo anie good thing, which requireth continuall praier to aid and  ſtrength it. Fiftlie, the wilie ſubtiltie of our ſpirituall enimie ſathan, who priuilie lurketh in the inward parts, waiting euen in our beſt actions to trip and ouerthrowe  vs, againſt whom we muſt by feruent praier vehementlie ſtriue. Sixtlie,  our owne greeuous aſſalts and cruell temptations, which neuer giue vs truce, reſt, nor quietneſſe, but haſten vs verie much vnto God for helpe. Seuenthlie, the zeale of the glorie of God, and aduancement of his kingdome, which ought wholie to  drawe and moone vs continuallie to exerciſe our ſelues in the ſeruice of GOD. Eightlie, the dailie dangers and continuall calamities that hourelie hang ouer our heads, which giue vs all cauſe enough, yea euen the moſt holie, and that with ſighs  and grones continuallie to flie vnto God our heauenlie father, and call vpon him by feruent praiers. Ninthlie, the infinite benefits and great bleſſings of God ſo bountifullie and plentifullie euerie waie powred continuallie vpon vs, which giue  vs both ample matter, and iuſt occaſion hourelie by thankeſgiuing, euen from the bottome of our harts to praiſe and magnifie him for the ſame. Tenthlie and laſtlie,  the great excellencie, woorthineſſe, neceſſitie, vertue, fruit, and profit of true and chriſtian praier, conſiſting partlie in the dignitie of God the commander, and partlie in the effect of obteining of whatſoeuer we aſke according to his will. Theſe things I ſaie, good reader, well conſidered, I ſuppoſe you will ſaie here is nothing ſuperfluous: but all little enough to ſo needfull and profitable an exerciſe of our faith, praier I meane, as wherein the peace of conſcience, yea our whole ſaluation conſiſteth, and whereby God himſelfe is ſaid to be preſent with vs, not onelie by his prouidence to watch ouer vs, but alſo by his power to ſuſteine and ſuccour vs, and by his goodneſſe and mercie to receiue vs into his fatherlie grace and fauour.
                  Yea I doubt not, but you will willinglie confeſſe with me, I ſaie, that all ſorts of deuout women haue great cauſe, and that continuallie, to take theſe lamps into their hands, thereby either with vaniſhed Hagar to acknowledge Gods graces towards them: or with deſolate Naomi to praie that God would bleſſe their children to be ſtaies and ſtaues of their age to their comfort: or with heuie Hanna to powre out their harts before the Lord in teares for a ſonne, and for his mercie and fauour towards them: or with wiſe Abigael, by praier to preuent the miſcheefes that hang as well ouer their heads, as their families: yea or with hir often on their knees to praie for the good proſperitie and preſeruation of their gratious gouernour Queene ELIZABETH: or with the church and faithfull ſoule of all chriſtians, to long for the kiſſes of the peace of Chriſt their ſpirituall ſpouſe, and neuer to ceaſe daie nor night to ſeeke him, whom their ſoule loueth, till by praier and meditation they haue found him: or with the wofull daughter of Sion, to lament and mourne pitiouſlie for their ſinnes, till their miſeries be mitigated, and they comforted: or with ſorrowfull Sara Tobit in faſting, and teares to be deliuered from dailie reproches and ſlanderous roongs: or wich vertuous Iudith in ſack cloth and aſhes to obteine ſtrength and courage mightilie to deſtroie and ouercome proud Olophernes, with all the huge hoſt of his bloudie ruffians: or with noble Queene Heſter to proclaime a faſt, and call their virgins, families, and people together, to praie daie and night to the hazarding of their owne liues alſo, if need ſo require for their owne further preſeruation, and their peoples and ſubiects ſafetie and deliuerance out of the hands of cruell Haman, and all his ſeditious conſpirators: or with chaſt and innocent Suſanna to appeale to God the high iudge of iudges, to be acquitted from a violeut death by falſe accuſation, and more vniuſt condeinuation: or with the afflicted church in exile, to acknowledge their ſinnes, and call for mercie to be deliuered from diſtreſſe: or with the woman of Canaan to flie vnto Chriſt in all neceſſities, to be releeued both bodilie and ghoſtlie: or with our

moſt gratious Souereigne Ladie Queene ELIZABETH, to muſe diuinelie of the inward loue of the ſoule towards Chriſt their ſpouſe, their Lord and father, mother and brother: or with the vertuous Ladie Queene KATHERINE, to vewaile the ignorance of their blind life led in ſuperſtition: and with hir alſo in all their troubles to ſtir vp their godlie minds patientlie to ſuffer all afflictions for the loue of euerlaſting felicitie: or with the right godlie Ladie Iane Dudley to endure the croſſe to death moſt patientlie: or with good Ladie Tirwit to exerciſe them ſelues morning and euening in fruitfull and godlie praiers, pſalmes▪ hymnes, and meditations: or with the honourable Ladie Aburgauennie by the like, to tread the path to paradiſe for the health of their ſoule: or with holie Agnus and Eulalia the martyrs, to triumph in the victorie of Chriſts death: or with Anne Aſkew the marryr to praie hartilie for their enimies: or with maiſter Bradfords mother to be petitioners vnto God for the conſtancie in faith to death of their children: or with miſtreſſe Dorcas Alarten carefullie to inſtruct their whole familie in the principall points of chriſtian religion: or with other graue and godlie matrones vnknowne, to exhort others to mortification and holineſſe of life, and to flie vnto God in all troubles for releefe as he hath commanded.
                  That ſo with the fiue fooliſh virgins it be neuer too late for them to crie, Lord, Lord, open to vs: but that to their comforts and the praiſe of God, with Miriam they may euermore vpon their timbrels ſing the ſong of Moſes, for their mightie and miraculous delinerance from ſathan their ſpirituall Pharao: and with Debora giue great thanks for the victorie got by our Iahel againſt Sicera: and with holie Hannah reioiſe from the hart, and praiſe God in the temple for the birth of their children, and ſafe deliuerance: and with the women of Iſrael triumph vpon timbrels for the famous victories of Dauids daughter our noble Queene ELIZABETH had againſt all hir enimies: and with the ſpirituall ſpouſe at the marriage daie ſing the ſweet ſong of ſongs to the glorie of the bridegroome Chriſt Ieſus: and with Sara Tobit bleſſe the name of God for their deliuerance from ſlanderous reproches, and the einil ſpirit Aſmodens, that enimie of holie matrimonie: and with holie Iudith highlie praiſe God for hir and hir peoples mightie preſeruation out of the hands of their cruell enimies: and with the bleſſed virgine Marie continuallie magnifie the Lord their Sauiour, for their high exaltation and fauour with God, with men, and with angels: and with our moſt gratious Queene ELIZABETH, inceſſantlie to yeeld all poſſible praiſe and hartie thanks for their ſo often, mightie, and maruellous preſeruation and deliuerance from ſo manie kinds of dangers, yea deaths and deſtruction pretended by ſathan and his bloudie miniſters dailie againſt them.
                  Finallie, that all godlie women (taking hereby good occaſion with theſe their holie foremothers continuallie to make their petitions for the preuenting of euils: their ſupplications, for the obteining of all things needfull for ſoule and bodie: their interceſſions as well for others, as for themſelues: and their thankſgiuings for corporall and ſpiritual benefits receiued) may ſhew themſelues daughters woorthie ſuch mothers: virgins woorthie ſuch lamps of perpetuall virginitie: and women woorthie ſuch ghoſtlie weapons of their right chriſtian miniſtration to helpe their weakeneſſe (praiers, precepts, and meditations I meane) by following their vertues wiſelie in the perfect feare of God: by bearing the ſame in the hand of their harts carefullie in the due obedience of their prince: and by fighting therewith in Golgatha the field of this ſpirituall warfare, the good fight of faith couragiouſlie in the pure loue of their countrie, and chriſtian charirie towards their neighbours: and at the laſt in the world to come to the glorie of God, & their euerlaſting comfort togither with the wiſe virgins, and all the elect people of God, ioifullie triumph ouer all weakneſſe, infirmitie, and corruption: yea ouer ſinne, death, hell, and damnation, and ſaie: Oh death, where is thy ſting? Oh hell, where is thy victorie?
                  
                  But now if in wading ſo far in this argument of praier, and in making this bolume ſo big, ante ſhall thinke or ſaic, that I, by mine idleneſſe and time thus ſpent, am verie chargeable vnto them: and conſidering the plentie of prater books more portable alreadie extant, ſhall iudge me to haue taken a verie needleſſe or bootleſſe trauell, or to haue laboured in vaine, and ſpent my ſtrength for nothing, as he that would addeſtars to the ſkie, or light a lampe at noone daie, and therefore

ſhall deeme me woorthie in their opinions to looſe both Oleum & operam. Oh forgiue me this wrong I praie you: and conſidering that I could not otherwiſe either ſatiſfie my ſelfe to go forward in my determined purpoſe, according to the preſcript order of this collection, or pleaſure the ſimple reader with ſuch plentie and varietie of profitable matter, eſpeciallie in ſo good paper and faire vſuall letter, a thing to the aged and feeble ſighted reader verie gratefull and much deſired. Let me intreate you whoſoeuer you be, to meaſure the ſame rather by the goodneſſe of the contents, of the which the godlie can neuer haue enough: than by the bigneſſe or deereneſſe of the volume, which to the willing and deſirous mind are euer beſt cheape. So no doubt ſhall the pleaſure and profit of the one at the leaſt counteruaile, if not far ſurmount, the paine and charges of the other.
                  As for my ſelfe (good reader) who haue rudelie as you ſee vndertaken this great labour, I proteſt, I haue doone it neither of preſumption, as he that would vſurpe the office of a Diuine, and intrude himſelfe into the ſtudies of other profeſſions: nor of arrogancie, as he that would boaſt and make great brags of other mens labours: nor of enuie, as he that went about to make fruſtrate and inſufficient the painfull and godlie works of better learned: neither yet of ambition or vaineglorie, as he that gaped after the praiſe and commendation of anie, or that would faine ſeeme to be approoued and regiſtred of anie Chronicler for an author, or one that knoweth ſomewhat, who in deed knowes nothing, much leſſe for all this deſerues to be thought of aboue that, which anie either of their owne knowledge, or by true report doo, or ſhall ſee in me, knowe me to be, or heare of me. Therefore I ſaie (good reader) my iudgement, howſoeuer it pleaſe others to iudge of me, and of mine intent herein, is, I knowe with the Lord that formed me from the wombe, to be his ſeruant: for he is the eie witneſſe of mine integritie and ſimple meaning herein, I ſaie, in whom my life is hid, and to whom I am made manifeſt, doo line, and muſt die.
                  As for my worke (ſo honourable for the verie authors, ſo godlie for the matter, ſo neceſſarie for the time, ſo profitable for the perſons, ſo excellent for the vſe, and ſo conuenient to increaſe pietie and chriſtianitie in the ſimpler ſort, howſoeuer otherwiſe with ſome carping heads, and euill diſpoſed readers, with Aeſops dog in the manger neuer giuen either to doo well themſelues, or to iudge rightlie and ſpeake truth of others) it is I am right well aſſured with my God, who firſt put me in mind to take it in hand, and in, by, and through whom onelie I confeſſe with humble and hartie thankeſgiuing after manie a yeeres fore trauell, in ſtudie much ſweet, long watching, and great expences, I haue now at the length finiſhed the ſame I truſt to his glorie, your profit, and mine owne comfort.
                  Therefore leauing to all and euerie of the woorthie works of other godlie men or women howſoeuer here or elſewhere extant, their particular vſe in the church of God, as they were publiſhed: and to the honourable authors themſelues their due deſerued praiſe and perpetuall commendation to all poſteritie, with exhortation to all godlie chriſtians reuerentlie, willinglie, and thankfullie to read, receiue, and imbrace the ſame, as wherein to the better fulfilling of ſo heauenlie an exerciſe of our faith moſt agreeable to Gods good will and word is perfectlie ſupplied and accompliſhed, by the rare gifts, ornaments, and graces of the holie Ghoſt in the compilers, whatſoeuer otherwiſe through ignorance, wanteth both in me, and perhaps in you alſo (good readers) if you be vnlearned. (Giue them therefore, O giue them, I ſaie, and that woorthilie of the fruit of their owne hands, and let their owne works praiſe them in all the world.) I to conclude humbly ſubmit my ſelfe vnto the graue iudgements of the godlie learned, and mine heroicall authors liuing, of whom I meeklie craue pardon for this my bold enterpriſe attempted both with baſhfulneſſe, doubtfulneſſe, and feare to become a writer in this ſo learned an age, or to trouble your ſtudies with my rude labours. And here laſtlie I offer theſe my labours ſuch as they are vnto the good liking and fauourable correction as well in matter, as in maner of you my right chriſtian learned readers, of whom in full recompenſe and ſatiſfaction of anie fruit, that either you or the ſimpler ſort ſhall hereby reape, I onelie now make this requeſt, as dutifullie to reuerence the diuine works of ſo noble and learned authors, by whoſe holie trauels you perceine your ſelues to enioie moſt ineſtimable benefits: ſo freendlie to take in good part theſe firſt fruits of my poore ſtudies, proceeding from a well meaning

mind, and built vpon ſo good foundations, as from him that did that hee could though not that he ought to benefit all, and to hurt or offend none. That they being now as lamps well eſteemed of in the opinion of the rich in vertue and knowledge, and gratefullie accepted and approoued of the learneder ſort, as the monuments of ſo famous matrones, may yet at the leaſt for their ſakes become welcome and approoued of all other ſimple chriſtians, and I by that meanes greatlie incouraged to go forward in vertuous ſtudies for the benefit of my countrie, with hartie thankeſgiuing vnto God both for his mercie, and your great curteſie and goodneſſe towards me, in whom I bid you farewell, and vnto whoſe heauenlie defenſe, almightie protection, diuine fauour, and continuall bleſſing, I finallie commend and betake both theſe my labours, my ſelfe, and you deere and welbeloued readers, beſeeching you to loue me, as I loue you vnfainedlie, to ſpeake of me and my worke, no woorſe than I doo of you and yours chriſtianlie, and that for his ſake alone that loued vs all moſt deerelie, & in that loue for vs all endured all maner of reproch and ſlanders that might be moſt patientlie, euen to the effuſion of his moſt pretious bloud often and ſundrie times trulie, as well in feruent praier as in ſweat, and otherwiſe on the croſſe for our eternall glorie: to whom therefore, and for all the ineſtimable benefits of his bloudie praiers, dririe death, and bitter paſſion be euermore rendred and giuen as of writers and readers, ſo of angels, men, and all creatures in heauen, in earth, or in the deepe, all poſſible praiſe and perpetuall glorie that hart can thinke, hand can worke, or toong can ſpeake,
                  Amen.

                  Si malè te morbus proſtratis viribus vrat;

                  Si te circunſtet vel mille pericula mortis;
                  Inuoca, nil dubitans numina, ſaluus eris.
                  Ergo ſi precibus vis tanta putetur ineſſe,
                  Praeponi precibus, nil (mihi crede) poteſt.

                  THus, good Readers, I haue ſet downe the names of ſome notable learned women to your conſideration, referring ſuch as deſire to knowe further of their ſeuerall works to this treatiſe following, and to Geſnerus, Bale, Ludouicus Viues, the Chronicles, and ſuch other writers of our time. Which I haue doone, not like a Sycophant to currie fauour by flatterie with women; but ſimplie, God is my witneſſe, & for good purpoſe: partlie, for that I well perceiue theſe and manie other not here named, for their well deſeruing and excellent works (a taſt wherof you haue here in this booke) haue heretofore beene had, and that right woorthilie, in great veneration of the godlie learned fathers and writers in all ages: and therfore are no leſſe of vs alſo to be reuerentlie regarded and had in honourable remembrance, to the perpetuall recordation and further continuance of their heroicall names and fames, as it were by ſome inrollment of their condigne praiſes and memorable dooings to all poſterities: but eſpeciallie for that I might hereby, as much as in me lieth, incourage, prouoke, and allure all godlie women of our time, in ſome meaſure, according to their ſeueral gifts giuen them of God, to become euen from their youth more ſtudious imitators, and diligent folowers of ſo godlie and rare examples in their vertuous mothers, that as they either in ſex, name, or eſtate are equall with them: ſo in learning, wiſedome, good induſtrie, and in all holie ſtudies and vertuous exerciſes commendable for women, they would dailie endeuour themſelues

to become like them, that ſo being lightened by their good examples both of life and doctrine, they may ſhine alſo together with them on earth, as burning lampes of verie virginitie; and in heauen, as bright ſtarres of eternall glorie: which God, for his owne name ſake, grant,
                  Amen.
               
               
                  VVhat ceremonie euerie woman ought by Gods word to vſe in the time of praier, publike or priuate.
                  1. Corinth. chapter II, verſe. 4, &c.
                  
                     EVerle man praieng or propheſieng, hauing anie thing on his head, diſhonoureth (God) his head: but euerie woman that praieth or propheſieth bare headed, diſhonoureth (hir husband) hir head. For it is euen one verie thing as though ſhe were ſhauen.
                  
                  
                     Therefore if the woman be not couered, let hir alſo be ſhorne; and if it be a ſhame for a woman to be ſhorne or polled (as in deed it is) then (for ſhame) let hir be couered (and keepe hir haire truſſed vp vnder a kercher.)
                  
                  
                     For a man ought not to couer his head (but ought to be polled and bare, for ſomuch as he is the image and glorie of God, in whom his maiestie and power dooth ſhine, concerning his authoritie ouer his wife, and other of Gods creatures ſubiected vnder his dominion and rule.)
                  
                  
                     But the woman is the glorie of the man (or receiueth hir glorie in commendation of man, and therefore is ſubiect:) for the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man: neither was the man created for the womans ſake; but the woman for the mans ſake.
                  
                  
                     Therefore ought the woman to haue power on hir head (that is, ſome thing to couer hir head in ſigne of ſubiection, bicauſe of the angels, to whom alſo they ſhew their diſſolution and ſhame, and not onelie to Christ and his church, or congregation where they praie.)
                  
                  
                     Iudge you in your ſelues alſo, is it comelie that a woman praie vnto God bare headed? Dooth not nature it ſelfe teach you, that if a man haue long haire like a woman, it is a ſhame vnto him: but if a woman haue long haire, it is a praiſe vnto hir: for hir haire is giuen vnto hir for a couering (and to the end ſhe ſhould truſſe it vp about hir head: to declare that ſhe must couer hir head.)
                     
                        But if anie man list to be contentious, we haue no ſuch custome, neither the church of God.

                           SIng ye vnto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriouſlie: the horſe and his rider hath he ouer throwne in the ſea.
                        The Lord is our ſtrength and praiſe, and he is become our ſaluation: he is our God, and we will glorifie him: hee is our fathers God, and we will exalt him.
                        The Lord is a man of war, Iehouah is his name: [in battell he ſtil ouer commeth, & is euer mindfull of his promiſe.]
                        Pharaos chariots and his hoſt hath hee caſt into the ſea: his choſen captaines alſo are drowned in the red ſea.
                        The deepe waters haue couered them: they ſunke to the bottome as a ſtone.
                        Thy right hand Lord is become glorious in power: thy right hand, O Lord, hath all to daſhed the enimie.
                        And in thy great glorie thou haſt ouerthrowne them

that roſe vp againſt thee: thou ſenteſt foorth thy wrath which conſumed them as the ſtubble.
                        Through the blaſt of thy noſtrils the waters gathered together, the fluds ſtood ſtill as an heape, and the deep waters congealed together in the hart [or depth] of the ſea.
                        The enimie ſaid, I will purſue them: I will ouertake them, I will diuide the ſpoile, and my luſt ſhall be ſatiſfied vpon them: I will drawe my ſword, mine hand ſhall deſtroie them.
                        Thou didſt blowe with thy winde: the ſea couered them, they ſanke as led in the mightie waters.
                        Who is like vnto thee, O Lord, among the gods, [or mightie men of the world?] Who is like thee ſo glorious in holineſſe, fearefull in praiſes, ſhewing woonders?
                        Thou ſtretcheſt out thy right hand, the earth ſwalowed them.
                        Thou in thy mercie haſt caried this people, which thou haſt redeemed and deliuered: and thou wilt bring them in thy ſtrength vnto thine holie habitation [the land of Canaan, or Mount Zion.]
                        The people and nations ſhall heare, and be afraid: ſorowe ſhall come vpon the inhabitants of Paleſtina.
                        Then the Dukes of the Edomites ſhall be amazed, and trembling ſhall come vpon the great and mightieſt men of the Moabites: all the inhabitants of Canaan ſhall waxe faint harted.
                        Feare and dread ſhall fall vpon them, bicauſe of the greatnes of thine arme or power; they ſhall be as ſtill as a ſtone, till thy people paſſe through: O Lord till this people paſſe through, which thou haſt gotten, or purchaſed.
                        Thou ſhalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountaine of thine inheritance, which is [Mount Zion] the place Lord that thou haſt made and prepared

for to dwell in, euen the ſanctuarie, O Lord, which thine hands ſhall eſtabliſh.
                        The Lord ſhall reigne for euer and euer.
                        For Pharao on horſebacke went with his chariots and horſemen into the ſea: and the Lord brought the waters of the ſea vpon them: but the children of Iſrael went on drieland in the mids of the ſea.
                        Sing ye [therefore] vnto the Lord: for he hath triumphed gloriouſlie: the horſe and him that rode vpon him hath he ouerthrowne in the ſea.
                     
                  
                  
                     The ſong or thankeſgiuing of Deborah and Barak, after the victorie giuen of God by the hands of Iaël, againſt Siſera. Iudges. 5, 2.
                     
                        
                           PRaiſe ye the Lord, for the auenging of Iſrael: and for the people [of Zabulon and Nepthali] that offred themſelues [gladly,] and became ſo willing [to reſiſt their enimies.]
                        Heare O ye kings, harken O ye princes: I, euen I will ſing vnto the Lord, I will ſing praiſe vnto the Lord God of Iſrael.
                        Lord, when thou wenteſt out of Seir, when thou departedſt out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heauens rained, the clouds alſo dropped water.
                        The mountaines melted before the Lord, euen as did Sinai before the Lord God of Iſrael.
                        In the daies of Samgar the ſome of Anath, in the daies of Iael, the high waies were vnoccupied [for feare of the enimies,] and the trauellers walked through bywaies.
                        The townes were not inhabited, they decaied (I ſay) and the inhabitants thereof were gone in Iſrael: vntill I Deborah came vp, which [miraculouſly mooued by God to pitie & deliuer them] roſe vp a mother in Iſrael.
                        They choſe new gods, and then had they war, or the

enimie in the gates: was there a ſhield or ſpeare ſeene among fortie thouſand of Iſrael? [they had no hart to reſiſt their enimies.]
                        My hart is ſet on the gouernours of Iſrael, and loueth them that are willing among the people: praiſe yee the Lord.
                        Speake yee [gouernours] that ride on faire Aſſe s[or Moiles,] yee that dwell by Middin [in danger of your enimies,] and that walke by the waies.
                        For the noiſe of the archers among the drawers of water ceaſed. There ſhall they rehearſe the righteouſneſſe of the Lord, his righteouſneſſe in his vnfenced townes in Iſrael: then did the people of the Lord go downe to the gates [without feare of the enimie.]
                        Up Debora, vp, ariſe and ſing a ſong. Ariſe Barak, and lead thy captiuitie [or them that kept thy people in bondage and captiuitie] captiue, thou ſonne of Abinoam.
                        For they that remaine, haue dominion ouer the mightie of the people: the Lord hath giuen mee dominion ouer the ſtrong.
                        Of Ephraun their roote [Ioſua firſt] aroſe [and fought] againſt Amalek: and after thee [Ioſua] Beniamin [that is Saule] ſhall fight againſt thy people, O Amalek, Of Machir came rulers, and of Zebulun they that handle the penne of the writer, [euen the learned did helpe to fight.]
                        And the princes of Iſſachar were with Debora, and [the whole tribe of] Iſſachar, and alſo Barak, he was ſent on foote into the vallie: for the diuiſions of Ruben were great thoughts of hart.
                        Why abodeſt thou among the ſheepfolds, to heare the bleatings of the flocks? For the diuiſions of Ruben [that came not ouer Iordan to helpe their brethren in their neceſſitie] were great thoughts of hart [and much maruelling.]
                        Gilead abode beyond Iordan [& yet came to helpe their brethren: therefore thou Ruben canſt haue no excuſe,] and why

doth Dan remaine in ſhips? Aſher continued on the ſea ſhore, and taried in his deſolate & decaied places.
                        But the people of zebulun and Nepthalie haue ieoparded their liues vnto the death, in the hie places of the field.
                        The kings came and fought, then fought the king of Chanaan in Taanach, by the waters of Megiddo, and wan no monie [but loſt all.]
                        They fought from heauen, euen the ſtarres in their courſes fought againſt Siſera, [and by Gods power his people were holpen to ouer come their enimies.]
                        The riuer of kiſhon ſwept them away [as a béeſome doth the filth of the houſe,] that ancient riuer, the riuer Kiſhon: O my ſoule, thou haſt marched valiantly.
                        Then were the horſe hoofes broken with the praunſing and oft beating together of their mightie men.
                        Curſe ye the citie of Meros [where ye fought] (ſaid the Angel of the Lord,) curſe the inhabitants thereof, bicauſe they came not to helpe the Lord, to helpe the Lord againſt the mightie.
                        Iael the wife of Heber, the Kenite, ſhall be bleſſed aboue other women: bleſſed ſhall ſhe be aboue women dwelling in tents.
                        He aſked water, and ſhe gaue him milke: ſhe brought foorth butter in a lordlie diſh.
                        She put hir hand to the naile, and hir right hand to the workmans hammer: with the hammer ſmote ſhe Siſera: ſhe ſmote off his head, after ſhe had wounded and perſed his temples.
                        He bowed him downe at hir feete, he fell downe, and lay ſtill at hir feete, he bowed himſelfe downe, and fell, & when he had ſunk downe, he lay there dead & deſtroied.
                        The mother of Siſera looked out at a windowe, and cried through the lattiſe: Why is his chariot ſo long a comming? Why tarie the wheeles of his chariots?
                        All hir wiſe Ladies anſwered hir, yea ſhe anſwered

[or comforted] hir ſelfe with hir owne words.
                        Surely they haue gotten, and found, they diuide the ſpoile: euerie man hath a damſell or two. Siſera hath a praie of diuers coloured garments, euen a praie of raiment died with ſundrie colours, and that are made of needle worke; raiment of diuers colours, and of needle worke on both ſides, which is meete for him that is chiefe in diſtributing of the ſpoiles.
                        So let all thine enimies periſh, O Lord: but they that loue him, ſhall be as the ſunne when hee riſeth in his might [and growe dailie more and more in Gods fauour.] And the land had reſt fortie yeeres.

Yea the Lord grant you that you may find reſt, either of you, in the houſe of hir huſband.

                           Samuel. 1, 11.
                        
                           O Lord of hoſts, if thou wilt looke on the trouble of thine handmaid, and remember mee, and not forget thine handmaid, but giue vnto thine handmaid a manchild: then I will giue him vnto the Lord, all the daies of his life, and there ſhall no raſor come vpon his head.

                           MIne hart reioiceth in the Lord, and mine horne is exalted in the Lord [for I haue recouered ſtrength and glorie by his benefit:] my mouth is inlarged or wide open ouer mine enimies:

[ſo that I can now anſwere them that reprooue my barrenneſſe,] for I reioice in thy ſaluation.
                        There is none holie as the Lord, yea there is none beſides thee, and there is no god like our God.
                        Speake no more preſumptuouſlie [againſt God in condemning my barrenneſſe,] let not arrogancie come out of your mouth: for the Lord is a God of knowledge, and his purpoſes come to paſſe, and by him enterpriſes are eſtabliſhed.
                        The bowe with the mightie men are broken, and they that were weake, haue girded themſelues with ſtrength.
                        They that were full are hired foorth for bread, [and ſell their labours for neceſſarie foode,] and the hungrie are no more hired, [but ceaſe to haue néede:] ſo that the barren hath borne ſeuen [euen many,] and ſhee that had many children is waren feeble.
                        The Lord killeth, & maketh aliue: bringeth downe to the graue, and raiſeth vp againe.
                        The Lord maketh poore, and maketh rich: bringeth lowe, and exalteth vp on high.
                        He raiſeth vp the poore out of the duſt, and [according to his owne will] lifteth vp the begger from the dunghill, to ſet them among princes, and to make them inherit the ſeate of glorie: for the pillers of the earth are the Lords, and he hath ſet the world vpon them: [therefore he may diſpoſe all things at his pleaſure, and prefer whom he will to honour.]
                        He will keepe the feete of his Saints [ſo that they ſhall neither walke nor fall into any euill] & the wicked ſhall keepe ſilence in darkeneſſe: for in his owne might ſhall no man be ſtrong.
                        The Lords aduerſaries ſhall be deſtoried, and out of heauen ſhall he thunder vpon them: ye Lord ſhall iudge the ends of the world, and ſhall giue power vnto his king [Ieſus,] & exalt the horne of [Chriſt] his annointed.

                         1. Samuel. 25, 24.

                           OH my Lord, I haue committed the iniquitie: and I praie thee let thine handmaid ſpeake vnto thee, and heare thou the words of thine handmaid. Let not my Lord I praie thee regard this wicked man Nabal, for as his name is, ſo is he. Nabal is his name, and follie is with him: but I thine handmaid ſawe not the yoong men of my Lord, whome thou ſenteſt. Now therefore my Lord, as the Lord liueth, & as thy ſoule liueth, the Lord, I ſay, that hath withholden thee from comming to ſhed blood, and that thine hand ſhould not ſaue thee, [nor reuenge thée on thine enimies.] So now, I pray God that thine enimies, and they that intend to doo my Lord euill, may be as Nabal: and I praie thee, forget the treſpaſſe of thine handmaid, &c.

                        The Church or faithfull ſoule ſpeaketh to Chriſt.
                        
                           
                              O That thou wouldeſt kiſſe me with the kiſſes of thy mouth [euen with thy peace which paſſeth all vnderſtanding:] for thy loue [O Chriſt] is better and more pleaſant [vnto me] than wine: and that bicauſe of the good and pleaſant ſauour of thy

moſt pretious balmes or ointments, [euen of thy great benefits, which I taſte and féele from thée.]
                           Thy name [O Chriſt] is as a ſweet ſmelling ointment when it is powred out and ſhed foorth: [thy mercie is ſet foorth and publiſhed by preaching thy Goſpell,] therefore the Uirgins [euen they that are pure in hart and conuerſation] doo loue thee.
                           Drawe thou me [O ſwéete Chriſt] vnto thee, and wee will run after thee: [for otherwiſe I confeſſe we can not come to thée, except we be drawne of thée.] The King hath brought me into his priuie chambers: [and reuealed vnto me the ſecret ioies not knowne to the world,] we will [therefore] be glad and reioice in thee, [yea] wee thinke more of thy loue, than of wine. [For] they that be righteous loue thee [aboue all things.]
                           I am blacke [I confeſſe through the ſpots of ſinne, perſecution, and troubles] O ye daughters of Ieruſalem: but yet comelie, faire, and welfauoured [through faith in the blood of Chriſt, in whoſe fauour I haue confidence and truſt,] as the fruites or tents of the Kedarens or Arabians: and as the hangings or curtens of Salomon [which within were all ſet with pretious ſtones and iewels.]
                           Maruell not therfore at me, bicauſe I am ſo blacke, [nor regard or conſider me by the outward apperance,] for why? the ſunne [euen the corruption of nature through ſinne and affliction] hath looked and ſhined vpon me. Yea and my mothers children [euen mine owne brethren which ſhould haue moſt fauoured me] were angrie againſt me, and hauing euill will at mee, they made me the keeper of the vineyards: but mine owne vineyard haue I not kept, [ſuch alas hath béene mine owne negligence.]
                           [Therefore féeling my faults and imperfections, I flie now vnto thée, O Chriſt, my ſpirituall huſband onlie for ſuccour, beſéeching thée and ſaieng,] Tell me, O thou whom my ſoule loueth, where thou feedeſt the ſheepe, [O ſhew me, I ſaie,] where thou lieſt, and makeſt them reſt at the noon day:

for why ſhould I be like hir that turneth aſide, or goeth wrong about the flocks of thy companions [whome thou haſt called to the dignitie of paſtors in thy Church: and yet they like apoſtataes not onelie ſet foorth their owne falſe dreames and traditions in ſtéed of thy true doctrine: but alſo are become the domeſticall enimies that perſecute the Church.]

                           O Thou the faireſt among women: if thou knowe not thy ſelfe [but art ignorant in my waies:] then go thy way foorth after the footſteps of the flock of ſheepe, [euen after the doctrine of the Apoſtles] and feede thy goates and kids by the tents of the ſhepheards [and learne of the true paſtors and ſpirituall doctors.]
                           I haue compared thee, O my loue, vnto the troupe of horſes in the chariots of Pharao [bicauſe that for thy ſpirituall beautie and excellencie there was no worldlie treaſure to be compared vnto thée.]
                           Thy cheekes and thy neck are beautifull as the turtles, and behanged with ſpangles, chaines, and goodly iewels: a neckband [alſo] imbrodered with gold and ſtuds, or buttons of ſiluer will I make thee.

Our bed [euen the hart of the faithfull: where thou, O Chriſt, dwelleſt by thy ſpirit] is all greene, bedecked with flowers: the beames or ſeelings of our houſe are of Cedar trees, and our croſſe ioints of Cipreſſe.
                           I am the roſe of the field, and the lillie of the vallies.
                        
                     
                     
                        CHRIST.
                        
                           YEa like as the lillie among the thornes: ſo is my loue among the daughters: [for my Church is to be preferred before & aboue all other things, yea ſo am I alſo among mine enimies.
                        
                     
                     
                        The Church.
                        
                           LIke as the apple tree among the trees of the foreſt: ſo is my welbeloued among the ſonnes of men, [I can not but teſtifie my loue and great deſire towards him,] for my delight is to ſit and reſt vnder his ſhadowe, bicauſe his fruite [and word] is ſweet vnto my mouth: [and when my ſtrength faileth me] he bringeth me into his own wine ſeller: and ſpreadeth the banner of his loue ouer mee, [and there I deſired to be comforted, ſaieng:] Set about mee cups or flagons of wine, and comfort me with apples, for I am ſicke of loue, [and lo, I haue felt it.] For his left hand is vnder my head, and his right hand doth imbrace mee.
                        
                     
                     
                        CHRIST.
                        
                           I Charge you, O daughters of Ieruſalem, [yée rulers, which haue to doo in the Church, as it were by this ſolemne oth] by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that yee wake not vp my loue, nor touch hir, [or trouble hir quietneſſe] vntill ſhe pleaſe, or be content hir ſelfe.
                        
                     
                     
                        The Church.
                        
                           ME thinke I heare ye voice of my welbeloued [ſpouſe Chriſt] behold, he [hath taken our nature vpon him, and]

commeth leaping vpon the mountaines, and ſkipping ouer the little hils [to helpe his Church:] My beloued is like a Roe or a yoong Hart. Behold, he [hauing his diuinitie hid vnder the cloke of our fleſh] ſtandeth behind our wall looking foorth of the windowes, ſhewing himſelfe thorough the grates, [ſo that we can not haue full knowledge of him in this life] and my welbeloued ſpake & ſaid vnto me.
                        
                     
                     
                        CHRIST.
                        
                           
                              O My loue, ariſe, and ſtand vp, my faire one, come thy waie, and go to thine owne. Behold, the winter [of ſinne, error, and infidelitie] is now paſt, [driuen backe and put awaie by my comming in the fleſh, which is compared to the Springtime, when all things flouriſh:] the raine is changed and gone awaie: the flowers [of good works] are come vp and appere in the fields: the time of the birds ſinging is come, and the voice of the turtle dooue [or holie Ghoſt] is heard in our land. The fig tree bringeth foorth hir figs, and the vines beare bloſſoms, and haue a good ſmell.
                           O ſtand vp then, and come my loue, ariſe, I ſaie, my beautifull one, and come awaie, O my dooue. Thou that art in the caues of the rocks, holes in the wall, and in the ſecret place of the ſtaires: [thou, I ſaie, that art aſhamed of thy ſinnes, come and] ſhew thy ſelfe vnto me. O let me ſee thy countenance, and heare thy voice. For ſweete is thy voice, and faire and comelie is thy face.
                           Take vs the foxes, yea the little foxes, which deſtroy the vines: [ſuppreſſe the heretikes and enimies of my Church whiles they be yoong: that is, when they begin to ſhew their malice, and deſtroie my vine, by preaching falſe doctrine:] for our vines beare bloſſoms, and haue ſmall grapes.
                        
                     
                     
                        The Church.
                        
                           My welbeloued is mine, and I am his: hee feedeth among the lillies vntill the daie breake, and till the ſhadowes be gone.
                           
                              
Returne [I praie thée] and come againe, O my beloued [Chriſt,] and be like a Roe, or yoong Hart vpon the wild mountaines of Bether, [euer moſt readie to helpe and defend me in all dangers.]
                           In my bed by night, [or in my troubles] I ſought him whom my ſoule loueth, yea diligentlie ſought I him, but I found him not [by carnall reaſon, but by the ſcriptures] neither was I incontinentlie heard.
                           [And bicauſe we muſt continue in praier till we féele comfort, though we féele it not at the firſt:] therefore thought I, I will now riſe and get vp, and go about the citie by the ſtreets, and by the hie waies and open places, and will ſeeke him [by praier continuallie,] whom my ſoule loueth, [for I deſire to be ioined inſeparably to Chriſt my huſband.] But when I ſought him [by carnall reaſon] I found him not, [but by the ſcriptures. Then ſéeking further vnto all others alſo, of whom I hoped to haue any comfort & ſuccor, at laſt] the watchmen that went about the citie found mee, to whom I ſaid, Sawe ye not him whom my ſoule loueth?
                           So when I was a little paſt them, I found him [by the preaching of his word] whom my ſoule loueth. I haue gotten hold vpon him, and will not let him go, vntill I haue brought him into my mothers houſe, [euen] into the chamber of hir that conceiued me, and bare me.
                        
                     
                     
                        CHRIST.
                        
                           
                              I Charge you, O ye daughters of Jeruſalem, [ye rulers and Magiſtrates that haue to doo in my Church, as it were by this ſolemne oth,] by the Roes and by the Hinds of the field: that ye wake not vp my loue, nor touch hir, [nor trouble the ſtate, quietneſſe, or peace thereof,] vntill ſhe pleaſe and be content hir ſelfe.
                        
                     
                     
                        The Church ſpeaking of hir deliuerance out of the wilderneſſe; and of the beautie of Salomons Temple, ſaith:
                        
                           WHo is this that commeth vp out of the wildernes like pillers or vapours of ſmoke, perfumed

as it were with the ſweet ſmell of Mirrh and incenſe, and with all maner ſpices or ſweet powders of the Apothecarie or merchant, [me thinke it is like the comming of the children of Iſrael, which were led in the wilderneſſe, and followed Chriſt fortie yéeres.]
                           Behold the bedſted, [or Temple,] which Salomon made, round about it ſtand threeſcore ſtrong men [euen] of the moſt valiant and mightie men of Iſrael. They all handle the ſword, and are expert in war, euerie one hath his ſword vpon his thigh, [watching, kéeping, and defending the Temple by the word of God,] bicauſe of the feare in the night.
                           King Salomon made himſelfe a palace, or chariot, of the trees and wood of Lebanon, hee made the pillers therof of ſiluer, and the pauement and couering therof of gold, the hangings thereof of purple, whoſe mids, or ground, was paued pleaſantlie with the loue of the daughters of Ieruſalem.
                           Come foorth, O yee daughters of Zion, [euen all yée that are of the number of the faithfull,] and behold this King Salomon [euen Chriſt become man] crowned [by the loue of God with the glorious crowne of his diuinitie,] wherewith his mother crowned him in the daie of his mariage, and in the daie of the gladneſſe of his hart.
                        
                     
                     
                        CHRIST.
                        
                           
                              O How faire art thou my loue! how faire art thou! [I can not chooſe but praiſe and commend all that is in thée, in whom I haue ſo great delight.] Thou haſt dooues eies, [euen a ſimple and ſincere faith,] beſides that which lieth hid within thy hearie locks [euen the fruits of a true faith] are like the wooll of a flocke of goates that be ſhorne vpon Mount Gilead, [ſo great reſpect haue I to the multitude of the faithfull ones, which are manie in number.]
                           Thy teeth, [or faith by the which all the faithfull are made the ſonnes of God equallie] are like a flocke of ſheepe in good

order of the ſame bigneſſe, which went vp from the waſhing place, where euerie one beareth two twins; and not one is vnfruitfull or barren among them.
                           Thy lips are like a roſe coloured riband, thy words are louelie, and thy talke comlie: thy cheeks or temples are like a peece of a pomgranate within thy hearie locks.
                           Thy necke [or preachers] is like the tower of Dauid, builded with coſtlie ſtones lieng out on the ſides for defence: a thouſand ſhields hang therein: yea and all the weapons and targats of the giants or ſtrong men [are fixed therein.]
                           Thy two breaſts, [the old Teſtament and the new] wherin are knowledge and zeale, [two pretious iewels] are like two twins of yoong Roes, which feede among roſes.
                           O that I might go to the mountaine of Mirrh, and to the hill of frankincenſe, till the daie breake, and till the ſhadowes be paſt awaie!
                           Thou art all faire, O my loue, and no ſpot [or blemiſh] is there in thee [in my ſight.]
                           Come to mee from Lebanon, O my ſpouſe: come to me from Lebanon. Looke from the top of Amanah, from the top of Shenir and Hermon: from the dens of the lions, and from the mountaines of the leopards [euen from all the corners of the world will I call thee, my Church and faithfull vnto me.]
                           O my ſiſter, [for ſo I cal thée my Church, in reſpect that I haue taken the fleſh of man vpon me.] O my ſpouſe: thou haſt wounded or bewitched my hart with loue. O my ſiſter and ſpouſe, thou haſt wounded my hart with one of thy eies, and with a chaine of thy necke, [yea I loue my gifts in thée, whom I haue therewith made ſo beautifull and rich.]
                           O how faire are thy breſts, my ſiſter, my ſpouſe, how faire is thy loue! Thy breaſts or loue are much better and more pleaſant [vnto me] than wine, and the ſauour of thine ointments paſſeth all ſpices.
                           
                              
Thy lips, O my ſpouſe, [bicauſe of thy confeſſion & thankeſgiuing, and through preaching of the Goſpell,] drop as the honie combe, [and bring foorth much conſolation and comfort:] yea milke and honie are vnder thy tongue, and the ſweet ſmell or ſauour of thy garments is like the ſmell of Lebanon.
                           My ſiſter, my ſpouſe is as a garden well locked or incloſed: as a ſpring ſhut vp, and a fountaine ſealed vp.
                           The fruits that are planted in thee are like a verie paradiſe or orchard of pomegranates: with ſweete fruits, as Camphire, Nardus, or Spikenard, Saffron, Calamus, and Cinamon, with all ſweet ſmelling trees of incenſe, Mirrh, Aloes, and all the beſt ſpices.
                        
                     
                     
                        The Church.
                        
                           O Fountaine of the gardens! O Well of liuing waters and the ſprings of Lebanon! [I confeſſe that all my glorie and beautie commeth of thée, O Chriſt, who art the true fountaine of all grace and goodneſſe to me the Church thy ſpouſe.]
                           Ariſe O north wind, and come O thou ſouth wind, come and blowe on my garden, that the ſpices & ſmell thereof may flowe out, and be carried on euerie ſide: yea let my welbeloued come to his garden, and eate of the ſweet and pleſant fruits that growe therein. [For this is all my deſire to haue thée, O Chriſt, my beloued ſpouſe, to come and comfort me, and to powre the graces of thy holie ſpirit from all quarters vpon me.]
                        
                     
                     
                        CHRIST.
                        
                           I Am come into my garden, [euen vnto my kingdome and Church, where I prepare the banket for mine elect, and beſtowe vpon them my ſingular benefits.] O my ſiſter, my ſpouſe, I haue gathered my Mirrh with my ſpice: I haue eaten my honie with the honie combe: I haue drunke my wine with my milke. Eate ye [alſo] O friends, drink ye, and make you merrie, O welbeloued.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                        The Church.
                        
                           I Sleepe [and am troubled with the cares of worldlie things,] but mine hart waketh: I heare the voice of my welbeloued that knocketh, ſaieng:
                        
                     
                     
                        CHRIST.
                        
                           OPen to me, O my ſiſter, my loue, my dooue, my derling, mine vndefiled. For mine head is full of dew, and the locks of my heare are full of the night drops: [hauing long patience towards ſinners.]
                        
                     
                     
                        The Church.
                        
                           I Haue put off my cote, [and confeſſe my nakedneſſe, hauing of my ſelfe nothing:] how ſhall I put it on againe? I haue waſhed my feete: [and am made cleane,] how ſhall I defile my ſelfe againe? [Yea therefore, ſéeing I am once by thée made cleane, I here promiſe now vnto thée, neuer to defile or pollute my ſelfe with ſinne againe.]
                           My welbeloued put in his hand by the hole of the doore, and my hart and bowels were affectioned, or moued towards him.
                           I roſe vp to open to my beloued, and my hands dropped with Mirrh: and the Mirrh ran downe my fingers vpon the hands of the barre, or locke.
                           I opened vnto my welbeloued, but he was departed and gone his waie paſt me, and my hart was gone when he did ſpeake. [For when I ſought him, and would faine haue béene annointed of Chriſt, I could not find him, bicauſe I thought to annoint him with my good works.] I ſought him, [I ſaie] and could not find him: I called, and cried vpon him, but he anſwered mee not. [For he left me for a time, to the end he might ſtir vp in me a greater deſire of him by continuall praier.]
                           So the [wicked] watchmen [and falſe teachers] that went about the citie found me: they ſmote me, and wounded my [conſcience with their traditions,] yea the watchmen that kept the walles, tooke awaie my vaile or kerchife

from mee.
                           I charge you [therefore] O ye daughters of Ieruſalem, [ye godlie watchmen of Zion, from whence the lawe & ſaluation commeth] if ye find my welbeloued, that you tell him that I am ſicke of loue, [and that ye direct me vnto him.]
                        
                     
                     
                        The daughters of Ieruſalem, or faithfull Chriſtians, to the Church, ſaie:
                        
                           O Thou faireſt among women, what maner of man is thy welbeloued aboue other louers? or what is he more than other welbeloued? or what can thy loue doo more than other louers, that thou doſt ſo ſtraightlie charge vs?
                        
                     
                     
                        The Church.
                        
                           MY welbeloued [to deſcribe his perfect beautie and comlineſſe vnto you,] is white, and ruddie coloured, the goodlieſt and chiefeſt perſon among ten thouſand.
                           His head is as the moſt fine gold, his locks are curled, and blacke as a rauen.
                           His eies are like dooues eies, by the water brookes, [which looke] as though they were waſhed with milke, and remaine by the fullers veſſels, and are ſet like pearles in gold.
                           His cheekes are like a garden bed, wherin the Apothecaries plant all maner of ſweete ſpices, flowers, and things.
                           His lips are like lillies, that drop downe pure and ſweet ſmelling Mirrh.
                           His hands are like gold rings, ſet with the Chryſolite, or pretious ſtone of Tharſis.
                           His bellie is like white Iuorie, deckt or couered ouer with Saphyres.
                           His legs are as the pillers of marble, ſet vpon ſockets of fine gold.
                           His face or countenance is as Lebanus, and excellent as the beautie of the Cedar trees.
                           His mouth, and the words thereof are ſweet, and he

is altogither louelie, and wholie delectable, [euen] this or ſuch a one is my loue, O yee daughters of Ieruſalem, [and] ſuch a maner of man is this my welbeloued [ſpouſe Chriſt.]
                        
                     
                     
                        The daughters of Ieruſalem, or the faithfull to the Church, ſaie:
                        
                           O Thou faireſt among women, whither is [this] thy welbeloued [Chriſt] gone? whither is thy welbeloued turned aſide, that we [alſo] may ſeek him with thee. [For hearing of this his excellencie and beautie, we are inflamed greatlie with deſire to knowe how and where to find him alſo,]
                        
                     
                     
                        The Church.
                        
                           MY welbeloued is gone downe into his garden, [and is conuerſant here in earth among men in his Church, which is directed by his ſcriptures,] vnto the ſweet ſmelling beds of ſpices, [is my loue come,] that he may refreſh himſelfe, and feede in the gardens, and gather lillies.
                           [I aſſure my ſelfe of the loue of Chriſt, and that] I am my welbeloueds, and my welbeloued is mine, who feedeth among the lillies.
                        
                     
                     
                        CHRIST.
                        
                           THou art beautifull, O my loue, as is the place, or ſtrong and faire citie Tirzah: thou art comlie and faire as Ieruſalem: fearfull and terrible as an armie of men with their banners.
                           Turne awaie thine eies from mee, for they haue ſet me on fire, and ouercome mee: [ſo excéeding is my loue towards thée my Church, yea I muſt néeds praiſe thy ſpirituall and comlie beautie alſo in all thy members. For] thy hearie locks are like a flocke of goats, which go downe to be ſhorne vpon the mountaine of Gilead.
                           Thy teeth are like a flocke of ſhorne ſheepe, which go vp from the waſhing place, where euerie one beareth twins, & not one is barren, or vnfruitfull among them.
                           Thy cheekes, or temples, are like a peece of pomgranate, within thy locks of heare.
                           There are threeſcore Queenes, and foureſcore concubines,

or wiues, and of the damſels without number. [For the faithfull are manie in number, and diuers orders and degrées of men there are therein: or the gifts and graces which I doo giue vnto my Church, are infinit.]
                           But my dooue is one alone, and mine vndefiled dearling, ſhe is the onlie beloued daughter of hir mother, and deere vnto hir that bare hir. [For diuers particular Churches diſperſed, make but one catholike Church.] When the daughters ſawe hir, they ſaid ſhe was bleſſed: ye a euen the Queenes and concubins, or wiues praiſed hir.
                           What, or who is ſhe that looketh foorth as the morning, faire as the moone, pure as the ſunne, terrible and fearfull as an armie of men with their banners? [Though the beginning of my Church was but ſmall, yet hath it growne vp to a great multitude.]
                           I went downe vnto the nut garden, [and looked vpon my Church, ſubiect to affliction, what fruit it bringeth,] and to ſee what grew by the brooks in the vallie, if the vine budded, and if the vineyard & pomgranats flouriſhed: [I went downe, I ſaie, into the Synagogue, to ſée what fruits came of the lawe and the Prophets, but] I knew nothing, [nor found any thing but rebellion therin.] My ſoule ſet me as the chariots of my noble people that be vnder tribute: [and I ran as ſwift as the nobles of my people in their chariots, to call them to repentance, ſaieng:]
                           Come againe, turne againe, O Shulamite, thou perfect one: turne againe, O my people of Ieruſalem, turne againe, and we will looke vpon thee. What ſhall ye ſee in the Shulamite, [that is, Ieruſalem, the which was Shalem, that ſignifieth peace,] but like men of war ſinging in a companie?
                           O how pleaſant and beautifull are thy goings with ſhooes, thou princes daughter! The ioints of thy thighs are like a faire iewell, which is wrought by the hand of a cunning workemaiſter?
                           Thy nauell is like a round goblet or cup, which is

neuer without drinke, or wanteth liquor, [but is euer repleniſhed with the rich knowledge of Gods word, and heauenlie deſires.]
                           Thy bellie or wombe is as an heape of wheate that is ſet about with lillies: [euen full of ſpirituall treaſures.]
                           Thy two breaſts [of the old teſtament and the new, which came from God,] are like two twins of yoong Roes, [and are of equall authoritie in the Church.]
                           Thy necke [or preachers,] is like the tower of Iuorie, [and ought to be pure and godlie.] Thine eies alſo are like the water pooles that are in Neſbon, by the gates of Bath-Rabbin, [euen thy magiſtrates muſt be well inſtructed in Gods word.] Thy noſe [or Iudges of good & euill,] is like the tower of Lebanon, which looketh toward Damaſcus.
                           Thine head that ſtandeth vpon thee is like Carmel, or ſkarlet, & the heare of thine head like purple. The king is tied in the gallerie or rafters, or dwelleth among manie water conduits, [and delighteth to come néere thée, and to be in thy companie.]
                           O how faire and louelie art thou my loue! How pleaſant art thou O my dearling in pleaſures!
                           This thy ſtature is like a palme tree, [which the more it is preſſed & perſecuted, the more it groweth and increaſeth,] and thy breaſts are like the cluſters of grapes.
                           I ſaid, I will climbe vp into the palme tree, and take hold of hir high boughes. Thy breaſts alſo ſhall now be like the cluſters of the vine, and the ſmell of thy noſtrils like as the ſauour of apples.
                           And the roofe of thy mouth like the beſt wine, which is meet for my beſt bloud, and cauſeth the lips of the ancient to ſpeake.
                        
                     
                     
                        The Church.
                        
                           
                              I Am my welbeloueds, and his deſire is to turne towards me. O come on my welbeloued, let vs go forth into the field, and take our lodging in the villages, and there remaine.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                        CHRIST.
                        
                           IN the morning will we get vp earelie, and go ſee the vineyard, we will ſee if the vine be ſproong forth, if the grapes be growne, and if the pomegranates flouriſh, and be ſhot out. [I will call them that profeſſe my word to an account, what fruit they doo bring foorth in my Church.] There will I giue thee my loue, or my breaſts: [euen my graces to the faithfull that are in my Church.]
                           The mandrakes haue giuen their ſmell, and in our gates are all ſweet things, new and old, which I haue kept for thee, O my beloued.
                        
                     
                     
                        The Church.
                        
                           
                              O That I [that is, the fathers of the old teſtament,] might find thee without, [that is, ſée the incarnation of Chriſt,] and kiſſe thee, whome I loue as my brother, which ſuckt my mothers breaſts, then they ſhould not deſpiſe thee nor mee.
                           I will leade thee, and bring thee into my mothers houſe, that thou [O Chriſt] mighteſt teach me, and that I might giue thee drinke of the ſpiced wine, and of the ſweet ſap of my pomgranats.
                           His left hand ſhall be vnder my head, and his right hand ſhall imbrace me. [His gratious fauour ſhall preſerue me from deſperation in aduerſitie, and from preſumption in proſperitie.]
                        
                     
                     
                        CHRIST.
                        
                           
                              I Charge you, O ye daughters of Ieruſalem, [ye magiſtrates or elders, which rule in my Church;] that ye ſtir not vp [contentions, or wars therein,] nor wake my loue, [by tumults and troubles,] vntill ſhe pleaſe.
                           Who is ſhe that thus commeth vp from out of the wilderneſſe, leaning vpon hir welbeloued? I waked, or raiſed thee vp among the apple trees, where thy mother conceiued thee, where thy mother, I ſaie, that bare thee, brought thee into the world.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                        The Church.
                        
                           
                              O Set me as a ſeale vpon thine hart, and as a ſignet vpon thine arme. [For I thy ſpouſe deſire to be ioined in perpetuall loue with thée, O Chriſt, by the ſeale of the holie Ghoſt.] For loue is ſtrong as death, and ielouſie is cruell as the graue.
                           The coales thereof are fierie coales, and a verie vehement flame of the Lord: ſo that manie waters are not able to quench loue, neither may the ſtreames of fluds drowne it: yea if a man would giue all the ſubſtance of his houſe for loue, he ſhould count it nothing: [but] would greatlie contemne it.
                           We haue a little ſiſter, [namelie, the Church of the Gentils,] ſhe is but yoong, and hath no breaſts, [but wanteth both the old and new teſtament.] What ſhall we doo for our ſiſter, when ſhe ſhall be ſpoken for?
                           If ſhe be [ſure and firme as] a wall, we will build vpon hir a ſiluer palace: and if ſhe be a doore, we will keepe or faſten hir with boords of Cedar trees. [If the Church be ſure and faſt, ſhe is méete for the huſband to dwell in, and we the Apoſtles will preach to them that are called inwardlie of God to ſaluation.]
                           [Yea] I am a wall, and my breaſts are as towers. [For I doo promiſe fidelitie & conſtancie vnto my ſpouſe Chriſt.] Then was I as one that hath found fauor and peace in his ſight.
                           Salomon [the Lord Chriſt] hath a vineyard at Baalhamon, and this vineyardlet he out vnto kepers, that euerie one, for the fruit therof, ſhould giue him a thouſand peeces of ſiluer.
                           But my vineyard, which is mine, is in my ſight before me: to thee O [Chriſt the ſpirituall] Salomon apperteine a thouſand peeces of ſiluer, and two thouſand to them that keepe the fruit thereof: [euen the greateſt profit, which is life euerlaſting, obteined by the grace of God, and not by our merits.]
                           
                              
O thou that dwelleſt in the gardens, [thy Church, where] thy companions [or faithfull ones,] hearken vnto thy voice. O let me heare it [alſo,] that my companions may hearken vnto the ſame.
                           O my welbeloued [Chriſt, if thou] flie awaie, and [depart from vs thy faithfull ones for a while, yet we beſeech thee] be like vnto the Roe, or as the yong Hart vpon the ſweet ſmelling mountaines of ſpices, [and make haſte (we praie chae) to come againe, and helpe vs in our troubles, Amen.]
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     The foure lamentations of the daughter of Zion, the Church, wherin with weeping, ſighing, howling, and with an heauie and wofull hart ſhe ſorowfullie bewaileth hir miſerable eſtate, being plagued of God, and forſaken of hir ſpouſe Chriſt, for his ſinnes, vnfaithfulneſſe, and rebellion.
                      
                        Lament. 1.
                     
                        The firſt Lamentation.
                        
                           
                              ALas, how doth the citie [Jeruſalem] remaine ſo ſolitarie and deſolate, that ſometime was full of people? How is ſhe become like a widowe? How is ſhe brought vnder tribute, that was great among the nations, & ruled the lands and prouinces as princeſſe?
                           She weepeth ſore continuallie in the night, and the teares run downe by hir cheekes: [ſo that ſhée taketh no reſt.] For among all hir louers ſhe hath none to comfort hir, yea all hir next friends trangreſſe againſt hir, and haue dealt vnfaithfullie with hir, and are become hir enimies.
                           Iuda is caried away captiue, bicauſe of [hir crueltie] affliction and great bondage, or ſeruitude, [and oppreſſion of their ſeruants, and the poore:] ſhe dwelleth [now] among the heathen, and findeth no reſt: all hir perſecutours tooke hir in the ſtrait places, where ſhee could not eſcape.
                           
                              
The waies and ſtreets of Zion mourne and lament, bicauſe no man commeth anie more [with mirth and ioie as they were woont] to the ſolemne feaſts: all hir gates are deſolate: hir prieſts ſigh and make lamentation: hir virgins are diſcomfited, hir maides are carefull, and ſhe hir ſelfe is in great heauineſſe.
                           Hir aduerſaries are the chiefe [rulers ouer hir,] and hir enimies proſper. For the Lord hath chaſtened and afflicted hir for hir great wickedneſſe, and hir children are gone into captiuitie before the enimie, for the multitude of hir tranſgreſſions.
                           And from the daughter of Zion all hir beautie is gone and departed, hir princes are become like harts that finde no paſture, [euen as men pined awaie with ſorowe, and haue no courage,] and they are driuen awaie, and gone without ſtrength before the enimie and purſuer, ſo that they haue no more power.
                           Now Ieruſalem remembred, in the time of hir miſerie and affliction, bare eſtate and rebellion, all hir toie and pleaſure that ſhe hath had in times paſt: ſeeing hir people is brought downe vnder the power of the enimie, and there is no man for the helpe hir. The enimies ſtand looking at hir, and laugh and mocke hir Sabboth daies [that is, hir Religion and ſeruing of God,] to ſcorne.
                           Ieruſalem hath greeuouſlie ſinned, therefore is ſhe come in decaie, and had in deriſion: all they that had hir in honour [now] deſpiſe hir, becauſe they haue ſeene hir filthineſſe: yea ſhe ſigheth and turneth backward, as ſhe that is aſhamed of hir ſelfe.
                           Hir filthineſſe is in hir ſkirts [and manifeſt,] yet ſhe [was not aſhamed of hir ſinne, nor] remembred hir laſt end: therefore is hir downe-fall ſo woonderfull, and there is no man to comfort hir. O Lord, behold mine affliction, and conſider my trouble, for mine enimie hath the vpper hand, and hath proudlie magnified himſelfe.
                           
                              
The enimie hath put his hand to all the pretious things that ſhe had: yea euen before hir eies came the heathen, and entred in and out of hir Sanctuarie, whome thou (neuertheleſſe) didſt command and forbid to come within thy Church and congregation.
                           All hir people ſigh, and ſeeke their bread with heauineſſe: and looke what pretious or pleaſant thing euerie man hath, that giueth he for meate to ſaue his life, and refreſh his ſoule. Conſider O Lord, and ſee, how vile I am become.
                           Haue ye no regard [to pitie me] all yee that paſſe by this waie? Behold and ſee, if there be anie ſorowe like vnto mine, wherewith the Lord hath afflicted or troubled me, in the day of his fierce and fearefull wrath, [and learnc to beware by mine example.]
                           From aboue hath he [euen GOD] ſent downe a fire into my bones, which preuaileth and burneth them cruellie: he hath ſpred or laid a net for my feete, turned me backe, and throwne me wide open: he hath made me deſolate, ſo that I am dailie in heauines, and muſt euer be mourning.
                           The yoke of my tranſgreſſions is bound faſt to [God] his hand, they are wrapped or wreathen, and come vp vpon my necke, [ſo that by no meanes it can be ſhaken off, or remitted, but onlie of his ſpeciall grace and mercie.] He hath made my ſtrength to faile: the Lord hath deliuered me into their hands, neither am I able to riſe vp, and quit my ſelfe from them [that haue me in bondage.]
                           The Lord hath troden vnder foote, and deſtroied all my valiant and mightie men, that were in the middes of me: he hath proclauned an appointed time, and called an aſſemblie to ſlaughter and deſtroie all my beſt yoong men. The Lord hath troden downe the virgin, the daughter of Iuda, like as it were [grapes] in a wine-preſſe.
                           Therefore do I weepe, and mine eies, euen mine eies

guſh out with water, becauſe the comforter that ſhould quicken me and refreſh my ſoule, is far from me. My children are driuen awaie and deſolate. And why? Becauſe the enimie hath gotten the vpper hand, and preuailed.
                           Zion caſteth out hir hands, and there is none to comfort hir: the Lord hath laid the enimies of Iacob round about him, and Ieruſalem is as a menſtruous woman, [who for hir pollution, is ſeparate from hir huſband,] and is become abhomination in the middeſt of them.
                           The Lord is righteous, for I haue rebelled againſt his commandements, & prouoked his countenance to anger. O heare I praie you, and take heede all ye people, behold my ſorowe, and conſider my heauineſſe: my virgins, my maidens, and my yong men are led awaie [priſoners, and] gone into captiuitie.
                           I called for my louers, but they deceiued me: for my prieſts and counſellers, but they periſhed [and died for hunger] in the Citie, euen whiles they ſought for meate to ſaue their liues, and refreſh their ſoules.
                           Behold, O Lord, and conſider how I am troubled, my bowels ſwell, my wombe is diſquieted, my hart turneth about within me, and I am full of heauineſſe, becauſe I rebelled ſtubbornelie: the ſword ſpoileth me abroade, as death doth at home.
                           They heare my mourning, but there is none that will comfort me: all mine enimies haue heard of my trouble, and are glad thereof, becauſe thou haſt done it: [but] thou wilt bring forth the daie and time that thou haſt pronounced, and calledſt, when they alſo ſhall be like vnto me.
                           Let all their wickedneſſe come before thee, and do thou vnto them, as thou haſt done vnto me for all my tranſgreſſions and treſpaſſes. For my ſorowe is verie great, my ſighes are manie, and mine hart is heauie.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                        The ſecond lamentation of Zion.
                        
                           ALas, how hath the Lord darkned the daughter of Zion in his wrath, [and brought hir from proſperitie to aduerſitie?] How hath he caſt the beautie and honour of Iſrael downe from heauen vnto the earth, and [giuen hir a moſt ſore fall,] not remembring his owne footeſtoole, [the Temple of Ieruſalem,] in the daie of his wrath, when he was angrie?
                           The Lord hath caſt out and deſtroied all the habitations of Iacob, without anie fauour: all the ſtrong places or holdes of the daughter of Iuda hath he broken in his wrath, and throwne them downe to the ground, and not ſpared hir kingdome, and the princes thereof hath he prophaned and polluted.
                           In the wrath of his fierce indignation he hath broken all the horne [or power and ſtrength] of Iſrael, he hath drawne backe his right hand [of ſuccour] from before the enimie: yea a flame of fire was kindled in Iacob, which hath conſumed & deuoured vp all round about.
                           He hath bent his bowe like an enimie, his right hand was ſtretched vp and faſtned as an aduerſarie, and euerie thing that was pleaſant to the eie to ſee, he hath ſlaine, he hath powred out his wrath like a fire into the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion.
                           The Lord is become as it were an enimie, he hath deuoured Iſrael, and conſumed all his palaces: yea all his ſtrong holds hath he deſtroied, and filled and greatlie increaſed the daughter of Iuda with much ſorrowe and heauineſſe, lamentation and mourning.
                           For he hath deſtroied his tabernacle as a garden, his ſolemne meetings or congregation hath he put downe, yea the Lord hath brought it ſo to paſſe, that the high ſolemne feaſts and ſabboths are cleane forgotten in Zion, and hath deſpiſed in the heauie diſpleaſure and indignation of his wrath [both] the king

and the prieſt.
                           The Lord hath forſaken his owne altar, and hath abhorred his owne Sanctuarie: he hath giuen the walles of hir palaces and towers into the hand of the enimies, who haue made a noiſe [with blaſphemous ſhoutings and criengs] in the houſe of the Lord, as in the daie of ſolemnitie and feaſting [when the people were accuſtomed to praie.]
                           The Lord hath determined to breake downe the walles of the daughter of Zion, he ſpread out his line, and hath not withdrawne his hand from deſtroieng: therefore he maketh the [inſenſible things, euen the] rampart turrets, and walles [as it were to take part of the ſorowe, and to] mourne & lament, becauſe they fell downe and were deſtroied together.
                           Hir gates are ſunke downe to the ground, hir bars are broken and ſmitten in ſunder, hir king and princes are caried awaie to the Gentiles, they haue not the lawe, neither haue hir Prophets anie viſion from the Lord.
                           The Senatours and Elders of the daughter of Zion ſit vpon the ground, and keepe ſilence, they haue caſt vp duſt and aſhes vpon their heads, and girded themſelues with ſackcloth: the virgins or maides of Ieruſalem hang downe their heads to the ground.
                           Mine eies do faile through weeping, and abundance of teares: my bowels ſwell, my liuer is powred vpon the earth, for the great hurt and deſtruction of the daughter of my people, bicauſe the children, babes, and ſucklings faint and ſowne in the ſtreetes of the Citie.
                           They haue ſaid to their mothers, Where is bread and drinke? when they ſowned and fell downe as the wounded in the ſtreetes of the citie, and when they gaue vp the ghoſt, and died in their mothers boſome.
                           What thing ſhall I take to witneſſe againſt thee? Or what thing ſhal I liken to thee, O daughter Ieruſalem.

[Thy calamitie is ſo euident, that it néede no further proofe.] To whome then ſhall I compare thee, O thou virgin daughter Zion, to comfort thee withall? For the breach [in thy hart] is like [the breach in] a maine ſea. Who may heale thee?
                           Thy [falſe] Prophets haue looked out vaine and fooliſh things for thee, and they haue not diſcouered thine iniquitie, or ſhewed thee of thy wickedneſſe, to turne awaie thine affliction, and to keepe thee from captiuitie: but they [to flatter thée in thy ſinnes] haue ſeene or looked out for the falſe propheſies, and cauſes of baniſhment, [and deſtruction.]
                           All that paſſe by the waie, clap their hands at thee, hiſſing and wagging their heads vpon the daughter Ieruſalem, and ſaie: Is this the Citie that men call ſo faire, the perfection of beautie, and the ioie of the whole earth?
                           Al thine enimies gape vpon thee with open mouths, they hiſſe at thee, and grinde their teeth, ſaieng: Let vs deuoure it, for certainlie this is the daie, the time that we looked for is come, we haue found, and ſeene it.
                           The Lord hath fulfilled the thing that he was purpoſed to doo, and performed his word that he had deuiſed and determined of old time long ago: he hath throwne downe, deſtroied, and not ſpared: he hath cauſed thine aduerſarie to reioice and triumph ouer thee, and hath ſet vp the horne [or power] of thine enimie.
                           Their hart cried vnto the Lord: O thou wall or citie of the daughter Zion, let thy teares run downe like a riuer: daie and night take thee no reſt, neither let the apple of thine eie ceaſe or leaue off [wéeping.]
                           Ariſe, ſtand vp, and crie in the night, in the beginning of the watches: powre out thy hart like water before the face of the Lord, lift vp thine hands towards him, for the liues of the yong children that faint and die for hunger in the corners of all the ſtreets.
                           
                              
Behold, O Lord, and conſider to whome thou haſt done thus. Shall ye women then eate their own fruit, euen their children of a ſpan long? Shal the Prieſt and the Prophet be ſlaine in the Sanctuarie of the Lord?
                           The yong & the old lie on the ground in the ſtreetes: my virgins and my yong men are ſlaine, and fallen with the ſword: thou haſt ſlaine them and put them to death in the daie of thy wrathfull indignation: yea euen thou haſt killed them, and not ſpared.
                           My terrours [euen mine enimies whom I feared] that are round about me, haſt thou called as it were to a feaſt-daie, ſo that in the daie of the Lords wrath none eſcaped, neither was anie left behinde: thoſe that I haue nouriſhed and brought vp, hath mine enimie deſtroied and conſumed.
                        
                     
                     
                        The third lamentation of Zion.
                        
                           HOw is the gold [or the princes] become ſo dimme? the moſt fine gold ſo changed? How are the ſtones of the Sanctuarie [or the prieſts] ſo ſcattered in the corner of euerie ſtreete?
                           The noble men of Zion that were alwaie in honour, and cloathed with the moſt pretious gold, how are they eſteemed, and now become like the earthen veſſels, the worke of the potters hand? [of ſmall eſtimation, and without anie honour.]
                           The Dragons [though they be cruell, yet for pitie] drawe out their breaſts, and giue ſucke to [nouriſh] their yong ones: but the daughter of my people is become cruell, [and the women forſake their children] like the Eſtriches in the wildernes, [which forſake both egge and bird.]
                           The tongs of the ſucking children cleaue to the roofe of their mouths for verie thirſt, the yong children aſke bread, but there is no man that giueth it them.
                           They that were woont to fare delicatelie, periſh in the ſtreets: they that afore were brought vp in purple and ſcarlet, now make much of doong.
                           
                              
For the iniquitie of the daughter of my people is beecome greater than the wickedneſſe of zodome, that ſuddenlie was deſtroied, and not taken with hands, nor anie camps pitched againſt hir.
                           Hir Nazarites or abſteiners were purer than the ſnowe, and whiter than the milke: their colour in bodie was freſh & red as corall, and their beautie like the poliſhed Saphyr, [ſo greatly were they once in Gods fauour.]
                           But now their faces be verie blacke as a cole, in ſo much that none can knowe them in the ſtreetes: their ſkinne cleaueth to their bones, it is withered, and become like a drie ſtocke, [and they are in greateſt abhomination vnto him.]
                           They that be ſlaine with the ſword, are happier than they that are killed or die with hunger. For they fade [and pine] awaie, as they were ſtriken through for the lacke of the fruits of the field [and foode.]
                           The women, which of nature are pitifull, haue ſodden their owne children with their hands, that they might be their meate in the miſerable deſtruction of the daughter of my people.
                           The Lord hath performed his heauie wrath, he hath powred out the furiouſneſſe of his wrathfull diſpleaſure: he hath kindled a fire in Zion, which hath conſumed the foundations thereof.
                           Neither the kings of the earth, nor all the inhabitors of the world, would haue beleeued, that the enimie and aduerſarie ſhould haue entred and come into the gates of Ieruſalem.
                           Which neuertheleſſe [contrarie to all mens expectation] is come to paſſe, for the ſinnes of hir Prophets, and the iniquities of hir Prieſts, that haue ſhed the bloud of the iuſt and innocent in the midſt of hir.
                           As blind men went they ſtumbling in the ſtreets, and ſtained or polluted themſelues with bloud, ſo that the heathen would not touch their garments.
                           
                              
But they cried vnto them, Depart and flee ye polluted: Awaie, get you hence, touch not [thoſe prieſts,] for they are vncleane, and be remoued. Therfore they fled awaie, and wandered, yea they haue ſaid among the heathen, They ſhall no more dwell there.
                           The anger, wrath, & countenance of the Lord hath ſcattered them, and ſhall neuer looke more vpon them, nor regard them. For they themſelues neither regarded, nor reuerenced the face of the prieſts, nor had compaſſion or pitie of their Elders.
                           Wherefore our eies failed, whiles we yet looked for our vaine helpe of man. For in our waiting we haue looked for [the Aegyptians,] a nation & people that could doo vs no good, nor ſaue vs.
                           They hunt our ſteps, and lay ſo ſharpe wait for vs, that we can not go ſafe in the ſtreets: our end is neere at hand, our daies are fulfilled, for our end is come.
                           Our perſecutors are ſwifter than the Eagles of the aire, they purſued & followed vpon vs ouer the mountaines, and laid wait for vs in the wilderneſſe.
                           The verie breath of our noſtrels, euen [Ioſias the king and] the annointed of the Lord, (himſelfe) [in whome ſtood our hope of Gods fauour, and on whome depended our ſtate and life,] was taken in their nets, [and ſlaine,] of whome we ſaid, Under his ſhadowe we ſhall be preſerued aliue among the heathen.
                           And thou, O daughter Edom, that dwelleſt in the land of Huz, [go to,] be glad and reioice [at our deſtruction and fall: yet be thou ſure thou ſhalt not eſcape.] For the cup [of Gods wrath] ſhall paſſe through, and come vnto thee alſo: thou ſhalt be dronken, and diſcouer thy nakedneſſe, and vomit [vp thine owne ſhame.]
                           [Be of good comfort therefore] O thou daughter Zion, thy ſinnes are fullie puniſhed, and thy puniſhment accompliſhed. [For after ſeuentie yeres, thy ſorowes ſhal haue an end.] He will no more carie thee awaie into captiuitie: but

thy wickedneſſe, O daughter Edom, ſhall he viſit, and will diſcouer thy ſins: [ſo that the wicked ſhall be tormented for euer.]
                        
                     
                     
                        The fourth lamentation or complaint of Zion.
                        
                           I Am ſhe, that through the rod of his wrath haue experience of miſerie.
                           He droue me foorth, and led me: yea into darkeneſſe, but not into light.
                           Surelie againſt me is he turned, he turneth his hand dailie againſt me.
                           My fleſh and my ſkinne hath he made to waxe old, and my bones hath he bruſed and broken.
                           He hath builded againſt me, and cloſed me in with gall and trauell.
                           He hath ſet me in darke places, as they that be dead for euer.
                           He hath hedged me in, that I can not get out, and he hath laid heauie linkes and chaines vpon me.
                           Alſo, though I crie and call pitiouſlie, yet heareth he not my praier.
                           He hath ſtopped vp my waies with hewen or ſquared ſtones, and made my paths crooked.
                           He laieth waite for me like a Beare, and as a Lion in a hole, or ſecret places.
                           He hath ſtopped vp my waies, and broken me in peeces, he hath laid me waſte, and made me deſolate.
                           He hath bent his bowe, and made me a marke to ſhoote at with the arrowe.
                           The arrowes of his quiuer [I ſaie] hath he ſhot [at me,] and they are entred euen into my reines.
                           I am laughed to ſcorne and had in deriſion of all my people, and they make ſongs [or ballets] vpon me all the daie long.
                           He hath filled me with bitterneſſe, and made me dronken with woormewood [and with great anguiſh and ſorowe

he hath made me looſe my ſenſes.]
                           He hath ſmitten my teeth in peeces with ſtones, and rolled me in the duſt.
                           Thus my ſoule was farre off from peace, I forgat proſperitie, and all good things.
                           And I ſaid, My ſtrength and mine hope is periſhed from the Lord.
                           O remember yet my miſerie, and my trouble, the woormewood and the gall.
                           Yea in remembring, my ſoule doth ſtill remember them, and is humbled within me.
                           I conſider theſe things in my hart, and therefore I get hope againe.
                           Namelie, it is of the Lords mercies, that we are not vtterlie conſumed for our wickedneſſe: for truelie his pitifull compaſſions faile not.
                           New mercies ſhall the Lord ſhew vpon thee earlie in the daie ſpringing euerie morning. O Lord great is thy faithfulneſſe: [for we féele thy benefits continuallie.]
                           The Lord is my portion, ſaith my ſoule, therefore will I hope in him.
                           O how good is the Lord vnto them that put their truſt in him, and to the ſoule that ſeeketh after hun!
                           The good man with ſilence and patience doth both truſt and waite for the health and ſaluation of the Lord.
                           It is good for a man to take and beare the yoke vppon him, in and from his youth vp.
                           He ſitteth alone [and murmureth not, but is patient,] and holdeth him ſtill, and keepeth ſilence, becauſe he hath taken and borne the Lords yoke vpon him.
                           He laieth his face vpon the earth [and humbleth himſelfe, waiting with patience,] if there may happen to be anie hope [of ſuccour.]
                           He offreth his cheeke to the ſmiter, he will be content with reproches.
                           
                              
For the Lord will not forſake for euer.
                           But though he ſend affliction, and puniſh, yet will he haue compaſſion, and according to the multitude of his mercies he receiueth to grace againe.
                           For he doth not plague willinglie, nor [delighteth to] afflict the children of men, [but doth it of neceſſitie for our amendment.]
                           To treade all the priſoners of the earth vnder his feete,
                           To ouerthrowe the right of a man before the face of the moſt high,
                           To condemne a man in his cauſe: the Lord hath not pleaſure in ſuch things.
                           What and who is he then that ſaith, And it commeth to paſſe, And the Lord commandeth it not. [For without his prouidence nothing is done.]
                           Out of the mouth of the moſt high proceedeth not euill and good: [both proſperitie and aduerſitie.]
                           Wherefore then mourneth the liuing man, [when God afflicteth him?] Let him mourne, and be ſorowfull for his owne ſinnes, for which he ſuffereth.
                           Let vs ſearch and trie, and looke well vpon our owne waies, and remember our ſelues, and turne againe to the Lord.
                           Let vs [without hypocriſie] lift vp both our harts and our hands vnto God, that is in the heauens, [and ſaie:]
                           We haue ſinned, and rebelled, therefore haſt thou not ſpared.
                           Thou haſt couered vs in thy wrath, and perſecuted vs: thou haſt ſlaine without anie fauour.
                           Thou haſt hid thy ſelfe as in a cloud, that our praiers ſhould not paſſe through.
                           Thou haſt made vs the offſcowring and reffuſe in the mids of the people.
                           All our enimies haue opened their mouths againſt vs, and gape vpon vs.
                           
                              
Feare and ſnare is come vpon vs, yea deſolation and deſtruction.
                           Whole riuers of waters guſh out of mine eies, for the deſtruction of the daughter of my people.
                           Mine eie droppeth without ſtaie, and ceaſeth not: for there is no reſt,
                           Till the Lord looke downe from heauen, & conſider.
                           Mine eies breake mine hart, [and I am ouercome with wéeping:] bicauſe of all the daughters [or people] of my Citie.
                           Mine enimies hunted and chaſed me ſore like a bird, yea and that without a cauſe.
                           They haue ſhut vp my life in a dungeon, and caſt a ſtone vpon me.
                           The waters flowed ouer mine head: then thought I, Now I am deſtroied.
                           I called vpon thy name, O Lord, out of the deepe pit, and lowe dungeon.
                           Thou haſt heard my voice: ſtop not thine eare from my ſighings and crieng.
                           Thou dreweſt neere vnto me in the daie when I called vpon thee, and haſt ſaid, Feare not.
                           O Lord, thou haſt maintained the cauſe of my ſoule, and haſt redeemed my life [that was in danger.]
                           O Lord, thou haſt ſeene my wrong: take thou my cauſe vpon thee, and iudge it.
                           Thou haſt ſeene all their vengeance, and all their deuiſes againſt mee.
                           Thou haſt hard their reprochfull & deſpitefull words O Lord, yea and all their imaginations againſt me.
                           The lips alſo of thoſe that riſe againſt me, and their deuiſes and whiſperings that they take againſt me all the daie long.
                           Behold alſo their ſitting downe, and their riſing vp: how I am now their ſong.
                           Reward them, O Lord, according to the works of

their hands.
                           Giue them ſorrowe of hart, and an obſtinate hart, euen thy curſe to them.
                           Perſecute them, O Lord, with thine indignation, and root them out, and vtterlie deſtroie them from vnder the heauen.
                        
                     
                     
                        The fift lamentation, or praier of Zion.
                        
                           CAll to remembrance, O Lord, what is come vpon vs: conſider and behold our confuſion and reproch.
                           Our inheritance is turned to the ſtrangers, and our houſes to the aliens.
                           We are vnderlings without fathers, and our mothers are as widowes.
                           We haue drunken our water for monie, and our wood haue we by ſale ſold vnto vs.
                           Our necks are vnder perſecution: we are wearie, and haue no reſt.
                           Aforetime we yeelded our ſelues to the Aegyptians, and now [we haue ſubmitted our ſelues] to the Aſſyrians, onlie that we might be ſatiſfied, & haue bread inough.
                           Our fathers which now are gone haue ſinned, and we muſt beare their wickedneſſe.
                           Seruants haue the rule of vs, and no man deliuereth vs out of their hands.
                           We muſt get our liuing with the perill of our liues, bicauſe of the drought of the wilderneſſe.
                           Our ſkin is made blacke like as an ouen, bicauſe of the trouble, famine, and verie ſore hunger.
                           They rauiſh and defile the wiues in Zion: and the maidens in the citie of Iudea.
                           The princes are hanged vp by their enimies hand: they haue not honoured the old ſage mens faces.
                           They haue taken the yoong men [for ſlaues] to grind, and the boies fainted vnder the burden of wood, [not able to abide it.]
                           
                              
The elders haue ceaſed from the gates, [ſo that there were no more lawes, nor forme of Commonwealth:] and the yoong men from their ſongs.
                           The ioie of our hart is gone, our danſe and melodious meeting is turned into mourning.
                           The garland or crowne of our head is fallen: Wo now vnto vs, and alas that euer we ſinned.
                           Therfore our hart is full of heauineſſe, and for theſe things our eies are dimme [with wéeping.]
                           Bicauſe of the hill or mountaine of Zion, which is deſtroied and deſolate, inſomuch that the foxes runne vpon it.
                           But thou, O Lord, remaineſt for euer, and thy ſeate & throne from generation to generation, world without end: [and therefore thy couenant and mercies can neuer faile.]
                           Wherefore doſt thou forget vs for euer, and forſake vs ſo long time?
                           Turne thou vs vnto thee, O Lord, and ſo we ſhall be turned: renew our daies as in old times.
                           But thou haſt vtterlie baniſhed and reiected vs: and thou art exceedinglie angrie and diſpleaſed againſt vs.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     The praier and thankeſgiuing of Sarra Tobits wife, which in hir virginitie, with faſting and weeping for the ſpace of three daies and three nights, ſhe made to be deliuered from the ſhame and reproch, wherewith hir fathers maids vpbraided hir.
                     
                        
                           Tobit. 3, 11.
                        
                           BLeſſed art thou, O Lord my God: and thine holie and glorious name is bleſſed and honourable for euer. Let all thy works praiſe thee for euer, O God of our fathers, which when thou art wroth ſheweſt mercie: and in the time of trouble thou forgiueſt the ſinnes of them that call vpon thee. Unto thee, O Lord, turne I now my face: vnto thee lift I vp mine eies, and [ſaie,] I beſeech thee,

O Lord, looſe me out of the bonds of this rebuke, or elſe take me vtterlie awaie from out of the earth, that I may heare no more anie reproch. Thou knoweſt, O Lord [minc innocencie,] that I neuer had deſire vnto man, and that I haue kept my ſoule cleane from all vncleanlie luſts. Thou knoweſt, O Lord, [I ſay,] that I am pure from all ſinne with man, and that I haue neuer polluted my name, nor the name of my father in the land of my captiuitie. I haue not kept companie with thoſe that paſſe their time in ſport: neither haue I made my ſelfe partaker with them that walke in light behauiour. I am the onelie daughter of my father, neither hath he anie man child to be his heire, neither anie neere kinſman or child borne of him, to whom I may keepe my ſelfe for a wife. An huſband haue I conſented to take, not for my pleaſure, but in thy feare: and my ſeuen huſbands are now dead, [one after another,] and why ſhould I liue [to endure ſo great reproch, as to be counted a murtherer of my huſbands? Now] peraduenture, either I haue beene vnwoorthie of them, or elſe were they vnmeete for me. But if it pleaſe not thee that I ſhould die, [as I deſire:] for thou happilie haſt kept me to another huſband, command [then] to looke on me, & to pitie me, that I doo no more heare reproch. For why, thy counſell is not in the power of man: but euerie one that ſerueth thee, is ſure of this, that if his life be in trieng, he ſhall be crowned: and if he be in trouble, that God no doubt ſhall deliuer him: & if his life be in chaſtening, that he ſhall haue leaue to come vnto thy mercie. For thou haſt no pleaſure in our damnation. And why? After a ſtorme thou makeſt the weather faire and ſtill: after weeping and heauineſſe thou giueſt great ioie. Thy name, O God of Iſrael, be praiſed for euer, Amen.
                        
                        And at the ſame time were hir praiers heard before the maieſtie of the great God.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     The praier of Iudith, which ſhe made with faſting and teares, for the deliuerance of hir people the Bethulians, out of the hands of Holophernes, and the Aſſyrians hoſt that beſieged their citie. 
                     
                        
                           Iudith. 9, 2.
                        
                           O Lord God of my father Simeon, which gaueſt him a ſword for a defence againſt the enimies, and to take vengeance of the ſtrangers, which vſed violence in their vncleanneſſe, and opened the wombe of the maid [Dinah,] and defiled hir: that rauiſhed the virgine, and diſcouered the thigh with ſhame, and polluted the wombe to hir reproch & confuſion. (For thou hadſt commanded that it ſhould not ſo be: yet they [the Sichemites I meane,] did things, for the which thou gaueſt their princes to the ſlaughter. For they were deceiued, and waſhed their beds with bloud.) And haſt ſtriken the ſeruants with the gouernors, & the gouernors vpon their thrones. Thou that gaueſt their wiues for a praie, and their daughters to be captiues, and all their ſpoiles for a bootie vnto thy children and ſeruants the Iſraelites, that thou louedſt, which were mooued with thy zeale, and abhorred the pollution of their bloud, and called vpon thee for aid.
                        O God, O Lord my God, heare me alſo a widowe, and helpe mee, I beſeech thee. For thou haſt wrought the things afore, and theſe; and the things that ſhall be after: and thou conſidereſt the things that are preſent, and the things that are to come. For the things which thou doſt purpoſe are preſent, and ſaie, Behold, we are heere: and looke what thou haſt taken in hand and deuiſed, it came euer to paſſe. For all thy waies are readie prepared, and thy iudgements are put in thine euerlaſting foreknowledge. O looke now vpon the armies of the Aſſyrians, like as it was thy pleaſure ſometime to looke vpon the hoſt of the Aegyptians,

when they being weaponed, perſecuted thy ſeruants, and put their truſt in their chariots, horſemen, and in the multitude of their men of war: but thou lookedſt vpon their hoſt, caſting a thicke darknes before them. And when they came into the deepe, the waters ouerwhelmed them: euen ſo Lord, behold, and let it go with thoſe Aſſyrians, which are multiplied by their power, and haue exalted themſelues with horſes, & horſemen: which glory in the ſtrength of their footmen, that truſt in ſhield, ſpeare, and bowe: and do not knowe that thou only art the Lord our God, which breakeſt the battels, and deſtroieſt the wars from the beginning. The Lord is thy name, and it apperteineth vnto thee to be called Lord.
                        O lift vp thine arme now like as euer from the beginning, and breake thou their ſtrength by thy power, & cauſe their force to fall by thy wrath. For they haue purpoſed, yea and make their vaunt and boaſt, to vnhalowe and defile thy ſanctuarie, to pollute the tabernacle where thy glorious name reſteth: and to waſte, ſpoile, and caſt downe with ſword and weapons the horns of thine altar. Behold their pride, and bring to paſſe, O Lord, that the blaſphemie of this enimie [Holophernes] may be cut downe with his owne ſword, and ſend thy wrath vpon their heads. Giue into mine hand which am a widowe, the ſtrength that I haue conceiued, that he may be taken with the ſnare of his eies in me, and that thou maieſt ſmite him with the lips of my loue. Smite (I ſaie) by the deceit of my lips, the ſeruant with the prince, and the prince with the ſeruant.
                        O giue me a ſtedfaſt mind, that I may deſpiſe him and his ſtrength, and that I may deſtroie him. This ſhall bring thy name an euerlaſting remembrance, if thou abate his ſtrength, and ouerthrowe him by the hand of a woman. For thy power, O Lord, ſtandeth

not in the multitude of men, nor thy might in ſtrong men, neither haſt thou anie pleaſure in the ſtrength of horſes, neither was there from the beginning anie proud perſons that pleaſed thee. But in the praier of the humble and meeke hath thy pleaſure beene euermore. Thou (I ſaie) O Lord, art the helpe of the humble and little ones: the defender of the weake, and the protector of them that are forſaken, and the Sauiour of them that are without hope. Surelie, ſurelie, thou art the God of my fathers, and the God of the inheritance of Iſrael: the Lord of heauen and earth: the Creator of the waters: the King and Lord of all creatures. O heare thou my praiers: heare me (I ſaie) poore woman, calling vpon thee, and putting my truſt in thy mercie. Remember thy couenant, O Lord, and miniſter words in my mouth, and ſtabliſh this deuiſe in my hart, that thy houſe may continue ſtill in holineſſe: yea grant me words, I ſaie, and craft, and a wound, and a ſtroke againſt them that enterpriſe cruel things againſt thy couenant, and againſt thine holie houſe, and againſt the top of Zion, and againſt the houſe of the poſſeſſion of thy children. Shew euidentlie among all thy people, and all the tribes, that they and all the heathen may knowe, that thou art the God of all power and ſtrength, and that there is none other that defendeth the people of Iſrael, but thou: So be it.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     Iudith hir praier that ſhee made ſecretlie, or mentallie in hir hart, when ſhe ſtroke off the head of proud Holophernes.
                     
                        
                           Iudith. 13, 4.
                        
                           O Lord God of all power, behold at this preſent, and haue reſpect vnto the works of my hands in this houre for the exaltation of Ieruſalem, that thou maieſt ſet vp thy citie like as thou haſt promiſed. Strengthen me, O Lord God of Iſrael, and grant that I may performe the thing,

which in hope that it may be done by thee I haue deuiſed. For now is the time to helpe thine inheritance, and to execute mine enterpriſes to the deſtruction of the enimies, which are riſen againſt vs. Strengthen me therefore this daie, O Lord God of Iſrael, now ſtrengthen me [I ſaie] O Lord God, [euen] in this houre.
                     
                  
                  
                     Iudith hir ſong of praiſe and thankeſgiuing, which ſhe, togither with all the people, made for their deliuerance from the hands of the Aſſyrians, by the deſtruction of Holophernes.
                     
                        
                           Iudith. 16.
                        
                           BEgin vnto my God with Timbrels: ſing vnto my Lord with Cimbals: O tune vnto him a Pſalme, and ſing a new ſong of thankeſgiuing vnto him, exalt his praiſe, be ioifull, and call vpon his name.
                        For it is the Lord that deſtroieth wars, and breaketh battels, euen the Lord is his name.
                        It is God, which hath pitched his tents, or campe in the mids of his people, and deliuered me and them out of the hands of all the perſecutors our enimies.
                        Aſſur came out from the mountaines of the north, in the multitude of his ſtrength, he came with thouſands in his armie: ſo that the multitude of his people ſtopped the water brookes, and their horſes couered the vallies.
                        He purpoſed to haue burnt vp my borders and land, and ſaid that he would kill my yoong men with the ſword, & daſh the ſuckling children againſt the ground, and lead awaie my children, and my virgins as a praie or ſpoile into captiuitie.
                        But the almightie Lord hindered him, and deliuered him into the hands of a woman, which hath brought him to naught and confuſion.
                        For the mightie [Holophernes] did not fall, nor was deſtroied by the yoong men. It was not the ſonnes of

Titan that ſlue him, neither haue the great giants inuaded him, or ſet themſelues againſt him: but Iudith the daughter of Merari, with hir faire beautie and comlie countenance hath diſcomfited and brought him to naught.
                        For ſhe put off, and laid awaie the garment of hir widowhood, and put on the apparell of gladneſſe, for the exaltation and reioicing of thoſe that were oppreſſed in Iſrael.
                        She annointed hir face with ointment, and bound vp hir heare in a coife, and tooke a new ſtole or linnen garment to beguile him.
                        Hir ſlippers rauiſhed his eies, hir beautie captiuated and tooke his mind priſoner, with the ſword or faulchin ſmote ſhe off his head.
                        The Perſians were aſtoniſhed at hir boldneſſe: and the Medes were troubled with hir hardineſſe.
                        But mine afflicted reioiced, and my feeble ones that appeared drie of thirſt, ſhowted for ioie: then [the Perſians and Medes] feared, they lift vp their voice and howled, and turned backe.
                        The children of maides, or the ſonnes of the daughters haue pierced them through, and wounded them as they fled awaie like fugitiue children: they periſhed in the battell for the verie feare of the Lord my God.
                        I will ſing vnto the Lord a ſong of thankeſgiuing: a new ſong of praiſe will I ſing vnto my God.
                        O Lord, Lord, thou art a great and glorious GOD, maruellous mightie and inuincible in power, whom no man may ouercome.
                        Let all thy creatures ſerue thee. For thou ſpakeſt but the word, and they were made: thou ſenteſt thy ſpirit, and they were created: and there is none that can reſiſt or withſtand thy voice.
                        For the mountaines mooue, and leape vp from their foundations with the waters: the ſtonie rocks melt

at thy preſence like waxe: yet thou art mercifull to them that feare thee.
                        For all ſacrifices are too little for a ſweet ſauour, and all the fat is too little for thy burnt offering. But they that feare thee, O Lord, ſhall be great with thee in all things at all times.
                        Wo to the people and nations that riſe vp againſt my generation and kindred. For the almightie Lord will take vengeance himſelfe of them, and in the daie of iudgement will hee viſit them, in ſending fire and woormes in their fleſh, and they ſhall burne, and feele them, and weepe for euermore: So be it.

                           O My Lord, thou onlie art our King: helpe me deſolate woman, which haue no helper but thee. For my danger, miſerie, and deſtruction is hard at hand. From my youth vp I haue heard in the kindred of my father, that thou, O Lord, tookeſt Iſrael from among all people, and our fathers from their predeceſſors and foreelders, that they ſhuld be thy perpetuall inheritance. And looke what thou didſt promiſe them, thou haſt performed, and made it good vnto them.
                        Now Lord, we haue ſinned before thee, therefore haſt thou giuen vs into the hands of our enimies: bicauſe we worſhipped their gods. O Lord thou art righteous: neuertheleſſe, it ſatiſfieth them not that we are in bitter and heauie captiuitie, and oppreſſed among them. But they haue ſtroken hands with their idols, that they will aboliſh and take awaie the thing, that thou with thy mouth haſt ordeined and appointed, and deſtroie thine inheritance, to ſhut, and to ſtop

vp the mouthes of them that praiſe thee, and to quench the glorie of thy temple, and worſhip of thine houſe and altar: and to open the mouthes of the heathen, that they may praiſe the power and vertue of the gods or idols, and to magnifie a fleſhlie king for euer.
                        O Lord, giue not thy ſcepter vnto them that be nothing, leaſt they laugh vs to ſcorne in our miſerie and fall: but turne their deuiſe vpon themſelues, and puniſh him [this wicked Haman I meane,] and make him an example, that hath begun the ſame againſt vs. Think vpon vs, O Lord, & ſhew thy ſelfe vnto vs in the time of our diſtreſſe & trouble: and ſtrengthen mee, O thou King of gods, and Lord of all power. Giue me an eloquent and pleaſant ſpeech in my mouth before the lion, [king Aſhuerus my huſband.] Turne his hart to hate our enimies, and to deſtroie him, [that Hamam I meane,] and all ſuch as conſent vnto him: but deliuer vs with thy hand, and helpe me thine handmaid that am ſolitarie, and haue no defence, nor helper, but onlie thee, O Lord.
                        Thou knoweſt all things, O Lord: thou woteſt that I hate the glorie and worſhip of the vnrighteous, and that I abhor the bed of the vncircumciſed, and of all the heathen. Thou knoweſt my neceſſitie, that I hate this token of my preeminence, worſhip, and dignitie, which I beare vpon mine head, what time as I muſt ſhew my ſelfe, and be ſeene, and that I abhor it as an vncleane or menſtruous cloth and that I weare it not when I am quiet and alone by my ſelfe. Thou knoweſt alſo, that I thine handmaid haue not eaten at Hamans table, and that I haue had no pleaſure nor delight in the kings feaſt, nor drunke the wine of the drinke offerings. And that I thine handmaid haue no ioie, ſince the daie that I was brought hither, vntill this daie, but in thee, O Lord GOD of Abraham. O thou mightie God aboue all, heare (therfore) the voice

of them that haue none other hope, and deliuer vs out of the hand of the wicked: and deliuer me out of my feare: So be it.

                        Behold, euen as the eies of ſeruants looke vnto the hand of their maiſters: and as the eies of a maiden vnto the hand of hir maiſtreſſe: euen ſo our eies waite vpon the Lord our God, vntill hee haue mercie vpon vs.
                        Haue mercie vpon vs, O Lord, haue mercie vpon vs: for we are vtterlie deſpiſed.

                        For he hath looked on the poore degree and lowlineſſe of his handmaiden and ſeruant:

for behold from hencefoorth, now ſhall all generations call me bleſſed.
                        Bicauſe he that is mightie hath done for me great things: and holie is his name.
                        And his mercie is on them that feare him, from generation to generation.
                        He hath ſhewed ſtrength with his arme: he hath ſcattered the proud in the imagination of their harts.
                        He hath put downe the mightie from their ſeates, and exalted them of lowe degree.

                     A godlie meditation of the inward loue of the Christian ſoule towards Chriſt our Lord.
                     
                        The firſt Chapter, Of the ſoules ſlauerie by ſinne: and redemption by Chriſt his paſſion.
                        
                        
                           WHere is the hell, full of trauel, paine, miſchiefe, and torment? Where is the pit of curſedneſſe, out of which doth ſpring all deſperation? Is there any hel ſo profound, that is ſufficient to puniſh ye tenth part of my ſinnes, which in number are ſo manie, that the infinit ſwarme of them ſo ſhadoweth my darkened ſenſes, that I can not account them, neither yet well ſee them? And I ſo farre am entred among them, that I haue no power to obteine the true knowledge of the deepe dangers of them. I perfectlie feele alſo, that the roote of ſinne is ſo graffed in me, that in my ſelfe I find none other effect, but all is, either branch, leafe, or fruit that it bringeth foorth in me.
                        And if I looke for better, a branch therof ſhadoweth mine eies: and in my mouth doth fall, when I would ſpeake, the bitter fruit of curſed ſinne. If my ſpirit be ſtirred to harken, then the noiſe of hir leaues ſtoppeth mine eares, and filleth my noſtrils with the ſmell of

hir flowers. Behold now therefore how in paines my ſoule, a ſlaue, and priſoner without light, or comfort, lieth crieng and weeping, hauing hir feete bound with the chaine of concupiſcence, and hir armes faſt tied thorough euill vſe. Who then hath power to helpe or remedie it? Not I: neither haue I power to crie for ſuccour. And as I can perceiue, there is no helpe of hope for me, but by the ſpeciall grace of God, which of my ſelfe I can not deſerue, but by Chriſt his onelie ſonne, whoſe brightneſſe giueth light to my darkneſſe: whoſe power examining my fault, breaketh the vaile of ignorance, and giueth mee cleare vnderſtanding what thing abideth in mee, where I am, and wherefore I labour.
                        He it is, whom I haue offended: he it is, to whom I did obeie ſo ſeldome: wherefore it is conuenient that my pride be ſuppreſſed. With weeping hart and ſorowfull ſighs, I humblie therefore confeſſe that I am much leſſe than nothing. Before my birth, mire; after a dunghill, hauing a bodie prompt to all euill, not willing other ſtudie: ſubiect to care, ſorowe and paine, ſhort of life, the end vncertaine, and vnder ſin by Adam ſold, and by the lawe condemned. For of my ſelfe, I neuer had yet the power to obſerue one onelie commandement of God, the force of ſinne was ſuch in me, and therefore is my ſinne no whit the leſſe to be hidden: and the more I cloaked and diſſembled my ſinne outwardlie, the more it increaſed within my hart. For what God would, that could I not will: and what hee would not, I oft times deſired to performe: which thing doth conſtraine mee by importable ſorowe, in this wearie and raging life, to wiſh the end of this miſerable bodie, through a deſired death.
                        Who ſhall he then be, that ſhall deliuer, or recouer anie good for me? Alas, it can be no mortall man. For his power and ſtrength is not ſuch as can deliuer me.

Who then? The onlie grace of the almightie GOD, who neuer is ſlacke to helpe the penitent with his mercie. Oh what a maiſter is that, which without deſeruing will ſhew his mercie on ſinners! I ſerued him ſlothfullie, and without ceaſing offended him euerie daie: yet is he not ſlacke in helping me.
                        He doth ſee the euill that I haue, what and how much it is, and that I of my ſelfe can doo nothing that is good: but with hart & bodie ſo inclined I am to the contrarie, that I feele no ſtrength in me, vnleſſe it be to doo euill. Yet doth he not tarie till I humblie praie him, or that ſeeing my hell and damnation, I doo crie vpon him: but his ſpirit whurling in my hart, greater than I can declare, aſketh for mee a gift, whereof the vertue is vnknowne to my little power.
                        And this the ſame vnknowne gift or whurling in my hart, doth bring mee a new deſire, ſhewing the good that I haue loſt by my ſinne, and giuen me againe thorough his grace and bountie, that which hath ouercome all ſinne.
                        O my Lord, what grace and goodneſſe is this, which doth put out ſo manie ſinnes? Now may I ſee that thou art full of all godlie loue, to make me of a ſinner, thy ſeruant and child. Alas, my God, I did not ſeeke thee, but fled and ran awaie from thee: and here beneath, thou cameſt downe to mee, which am nothing but a woorme of the earth all naked. What doo I ſaie? A woorme? Naie, woorſe than a woorme, full of pride, deceit, malice, and treaſon. The promiſe which my friends made when I was baptiſed, is ſuch, that I alwaies, thorough faith in thy paſſion, ſhould feele the mortification of my fleſh, and dwell alwaies with thee in the croſſe, where thou waſt faſt nailed as I beleeue, and yeelded death dead, as I alſo ſhould yeeld all ſinne.
                        This haue I oftentimes vntied, taken downe, and ſet at large; I haue broken, denied, and falſified my

promiſe, and through pride I haue lifted vp my will in ſuch maner, that through ſloth, my dutie towards thee was forgotten, and that much more is, as well the profit, or value, which I had of thee in the daie of my baptiſme, as alſo thy ſauing loue and promiſes folowing, I haue all alike neglected? What ſhall I ſaie more? Albeit that oftentimes thou perceiuing mee wretched, and vnhappie, haſt giuen me ſo manie warnings in faith and ſacraments, admoniſhing mee by preachings, and comforted mee by the receiuing of thy bleſſed bodie and ſacred bloud, promiſing by the ſame to put me in the number of them that now are adorned with perfect innocencie: yet haue I all theſe high benefits throwne into forgetfulneſſe.
                        Oftentimes, O Lord, haue I with thee broken couenant, & partlie for that my poore ſoule was too much fed with the euill bread or damnable doctrine of hypocrites, I deſpiſed ſuch ſuccour and ghoſtlie phyſicke in Gods word, as would haue helped mee, if I had beene willing to looke for it: yet knew I at that time no teacher conuenient. For there is neither man, Saint, nor Angel, that can without thy ſpirit change the hart of a ſinner. Alas, good Ieſus, thou beholding my blindneſſe, and that at my neede I could haue no ſuccour of men, didſt open the waie of my ſaluation. O how great is thy goodneſſe, and how ineſtimable the ſweeteneſſe which thou haſt ſhewed therein! Is there anie father ſo naturall to the daughter, or brother to the ſiſter, which would euer haue done as thou haſt done? For thou cameſt downe into hel to ſuccour my ſoule, where againſt thy will ſhee was, intending to haue periſhed, bicauſe ſhe did not loue thee.
                        Alas, ſweet Lord, thou haſt loued hir, yea euen to the verie outſhedding of thy moſt pretious bloud. O charitie feruent and incomparable! Nothing ſlacke art thou in loue, that ſo louedſt euerie ſinner, yea and alſo

thine enimies, not onelie in forgiuing their offences, but alſo in giuing thy ſelfe for their ſaluation, libertie, and deliuerance to the death, croſſe, trauell, paine, and ſufferance. When I caſt in mind what ſhould be the occaſion of thy loue towards mee, I can ſee nothing elſe but a loue woonderfull, which moueth thee to giue me that, which I can not deſerue. Then as far foorth as I can ſee, I ought to giue no thanks for my ſaluation, but onlie to thee my Lord Ieſu, to whom I owe the praiſe thereof, as to him which is my Sauior and Creator.
                     
                     
                        The ſecond Chapter, Of the ſoules affinitie with Chriſt.
                        
                           WHat a thing is it, O God, that thou haſt done ſo much for me? Thou art not onelie contented to haue forgiuen me my ſinnes, but alſo haſt giuen vnto mee the right fortunate gift of grace.
                        For it ſhould ſuffice mee, I comming out of ſuch a danger, to be like a ſtranger vſed. But thou doeſt handle my ſoule, if I durſt ſo ſay it, as a mother, daughter, ſiſter, and wife: notwithſtanding, my Lord, I am the treſpaſſer, which am not woorthie to come neere the doore of thy right high place, to aſke bread, where thy dwelling is. Oh what grace is this, that ſo ſuddenlie thou vouchſafeſt to drawe my ſoule into ſuch highnes, that ſhe feeleth hir ſelfe ruler of my bodie! She poore, ignorant, and lame, doth find hir ſelfe with thee rich, wiſe, and ſtrong, bicauſe thou haſt written in hir hart, the roote of thy ſpirit and holie word, giuing hir true faith to receiue it, which thing made hir to conceiue thy ſonne, in beleeuing him to be man, God, Sauiour, and alſo the true forgiuer of ſinnes. Therefore doeſt thou aſſure hir, that ſhee is mother to thy Sonne, of whome thou art the onlie father.
                        
                           
And furthermore, O my father, here is a great loue of thy well dooing, that thy holie ſonne hath taken on him the bodie of a man, & hath mingled himſelfe with our aſhes, which thing we may not vnderſtand, without a moſt true faith. It hath pleaſed thee to put him ſo neere vs, that he did ioine himſelfe to our fleſh, and I ſeeing him to be called man, am bold to call him brother. Now ſith my ſoule may ſaie of hir ſelfe, that ſhee is the ſiſter of God, ought ſhe not to haue hir ſelfe aſſured in him? Yes trulie. For thou doeſt declare with great loue, that hir creation was onlie of thy good wil, which it pleaſeth thee alwaies to haue towards hir, giuing aſſurance, that before hir firſt daie, or time of being prouided for hir, thou thorough loue haſt made hir, as thou of power alone canſt well doo it, and alſo didſt put hir within this bodie, not for to ſlacke with ſloth, but that both of them ſhould haue none other exerciſe, but only to thinke how to doo ſome ſeruice vnto thee.
                        Then this truth maketh hir to feele that there is in thee true paternitie. O what honor, what ſweetneſſe, and what glorie hath the ſoule, which doeth alwaies remember that ſhe is thy daughter, and that in calling thee father, ſhee doth thy commandement! What is there more? Is that all? No, it doth pleaſe thee to giue hir another name, to call hir thy wife, and that ſhe againe doo call thee huſband, declaring therby how thou haſt freelie manifeſted the mariage of hir. By baptiſme haſt thou made a promiſe, to giue hir thy goods and riches, and to take on thee hir ſinnes: for ſhe hath nothing by heritage but ſinne of hir firſt father Adam. All hir treaſures that ſhe hath of nature, are nothing elſe but ſinnes, which thou haſt tied vpon the Croſſe, and paid all hir debts with thy goodes & lands.
                        Thou haſt made hir ſo rich, and with ſo great a iointure endued hir, that ſhe knowing hir ſelfe to be thy

wedded wife, doth beleeue to be quit of all that ſhe oweth, eſteeming verie little that ſhee hath heere beneath. She forſaketh hir old father, and all the goods that he giueth hir, for hir huſbands ſake. For ſurelie, O my GOD, it hurteth my ſoule to be fed with ſuch good: and againe releeued in leauing the pleaſures of this world, for that which is eternal, and where peace is without warre. Father, alas, what ought I to thinke? Shall my ſpirit be ſo bold as to take vpon him to call thee father? yea, and alſo our father, for ſo haſt thou taught in the Pater noſter. But to call me daughter, haſt thou ſo ſaid? I praie thee tell me. Alas, yea Lord, when with great ſweetnes thou ſaiedſt: Daughter, lend me thy hart: and againe, thou ſaiedſt, Daughter thy faith hath ſaued thee.
                        O my ſoule, inſtead of lending, my Lord is readie to giue himſelfe wholie vnto thee: receiue him then, and do not permit that anie creature put him from thee, ſo that for euer with faithfull ſtedfaſtneſſe he may loue thee, with a daughterlie loue. Now my Lord, if thou be my father, may I thinke that I may be thy mother? Indeede I can not well perceiue, how I ſhould conceiue thee that createdſt me: but in this matter, thou diddeſt ſatiſfie my doubt, when in preaching and in ſtretching forth thy hands, thou didſt ſaie, Thoſe that ſhall do the will of my father, they are my brethren, my ſiſter, and my mother. I beleue then, that hearing, and reading the words that thou haſt taught, and vttered by thy holie Prophets and Apoſtles: the ſame alſo which through thy true Preachers thou doſt dailie declare vnto men, in beleeuing it, and ſtedfaſtlie deſiring to fulfill the ſame, I conceiue thee, and beare thee by loue.
                        Therfore without anie feare I wil take vpon me the name of a mother. What? Mother of Chriſt? O ſweet virgine Marie, I beſeech thee be not angrie that I

take vp ſuch a title: I do neither ſteale, nor vſurpe anie thing vpon thy priuiledge, for thou onelie aboue all women, receiuedſt of him ſo great honour, that no man can in himſelfe comprehend, how he hath beene willing to take in thee our fleſh: for thou art the mother and perfect virgine, before, and after, and in his holie birth. In thy bleſſed wombe thou didſt beare him and nouriſh him, thou didſt followe him in his tribulations, and alſo in his teachings. Now brieflie to conclude, thou haſt with God found ſuch grace, as the enimie through malice and deceit had cauſed Adam and his poſteritie to loſe: by Eue, and him we haue loſt it, and by the Sonne hath it been yeelded vnto vs againe.
                        Therefore haſt thou bene rightfullie called full of grace, as one to whome the Lord hath ſhewed aboundant fauour. Sith then that he, which is the beſt among them that be good, and alſo the ſpring of all goodneſſe and power, hath created in thee ſo pure innocencie, endued thee with ſuch grace, & exalted thee to ſuch dignitie, that he in thee, of all other the example of vertue, hath builded his dwelling and temple: he through loue did confirme himſelfe with thee, and thou through grace art confirmed in him, therefore no man can giue thee greater praiſe, then God himſelfe hath giuen thee, for there is no ſuch praiſe, as is the ſame, which commeth from God. Thou alſo haſt had ſo firme and conſtant a faith, that thou by the holie Ghoſt waſt filled with all godlineſſe. I will not take vpon me therefore to giue to thee greater praiſe, than the honour which thy ſonne and ſoueraigne Lord hath giuen thee. And as thou art his corporall mother, ſo art thou thorough faith his ſpirituall mother: and I following thy faith with all humbleneſſe, am his ſpirituall mother alſo.
                        Alas, my God, the brotherlineſſe that thou haſt towards me, thorough thy humbleneſſe, in calling me ſiſter,

is great, for thou haſt broken the kindred of mine old father, calling me daughter by adoption. Seeing then that we haue both one father, I will not feare to call thee my brother. For thou haſt ſo reported it by the wiſe Salomon in his Canticle, ſaieng: My ſiſter and ſpouſe, thou haſt wounded my hart with the ſweete looke of one of thine eies, &c. Alas my brother, I wiſh for nothing elſe, but that in wounding thee, I might finde my ſelfe wounded with thy loue, to that would I giue ouer my ſelfe. And likewiſe, thou doeſt call mee wife, ſpeaking to me theſe amorous words: Ariſe my deere doue, and come hitherward my delectable ſpouſe. Wherefore I may ſaie with louing faith, Thou art mine, and I am thine, bicauſe thou haſt called me thy loue and faire ſpouſe. If I be ſo, ſuch haſt thou made me. Alas, doth it pleaſe thee to giue me ſuch names? Trulie they are able to breake the hart, and cauſe it to burne through loue vnſpeakeable, when it thinketh vpon the honour that thou doeſt vnto the ſoule, which is much greater than it hath deſerued. A mother, a mother? Alas, but of what child is it? My God, my ſonne? O Ieſus what ſpeech is this! Mother, daughter, ſiſter, and brother. O happie kindred! O what ſweetneſſe doth proceede out of that paternitie! But what daughterlie and reuerent feare ought I to haue towards him, my father, yea and my creator, my protector, and ſauiour, to be my brother? Alas, heere is a great loue: I will therfore ſaie with Salomon, Now can my hart no longer refraine, but breake in ſunder, to make roome for the ſame ſo ſweete a brother, ſo that none other name be written in the ſame, but onlie the name of my brother Ieſus the ſonne of God. None other creature will I giue place to, for all the ſcurging and beating that can be done vnto me: keepe my hart then my deere brother and loue, and let not thine enimie enter into it.
                     
                     
                        
                        The third Chapter, Of the ſoules infidelitie or apoſtaſie from GOD.
                        
                        
                           O My ſweete Father, my child, my brother, and ſpouſe, with hands ioined, humblie vpon my knees I yeeld thee thanks and praiſes, that it pleaſeth thee to turne thy face towards me, conuerting my hart, and couering me with ſuch grace, that thou doeſt ſee no more my euils and ſinnes. So well haſt thou hidden them, that it ſeemeth thou haſt put them in forgetfulneſſe: yea and alſo they ſeeme to be forgotten of me, which haue done and committed them. For faith and loue ſo working in me, cauſeth me to forget them, wholie putting my truſt in thee alone.
                        Then my Father, in whome lieth vnfeigned loue, whereof can I haue feare in my hart? I confeſſe that I haue done all the euill that one creature can doo, and that of my ſelfe I am naught. Alſo, I haue offended thee, as did the prodigall child, following the fooliſh trade of the fleſh, wherewith I haue prodigallie ſpent the ſubſtance and aboundance of goodes, which thou heere haſt giuen me to vſe to thy glorie: and for the miſpending of them, pouertie hath taken me, and hath withered me awaie, euen as haie, and yeelded my ſpirit dead for hunger, compelling me to eate the reliefe of ſwine: but in ſuch meates I found verie little ſauour. Then I ſeeing my life to be ſo miſerable, did returne to thee my father againe, ſaieng: Alas deere father, I haue ſinned againſt heauen, and before thee, I am therefore no more Worthie to be called thy child. But O bountifull and mercifull father, do thou no worſſe to me, than to one of thy houſhold ſeruants. Alas, deere father, what loue and zeale is this, that thou wouldeſt not tarie my comming and praier, but ſpeedilie

ſtretching foorth thy hands, receiuedſt me, when I did thinke thou wouldeſt not looke on me: and ſo receiuing me, in ſtead to haue puniſhed me, thou didſt aſſure me of my ſaluation? Where is he then that ſhall puniſh me, when my father ſhall denie him my ſinne? There is no Iudge that can condemne me, vnleſſe God himſelfe will damne me: the want of goodneſſe I feare not, for I haue my God for my father: my enimie ſhall do me no harme, for my father will take all his ſtrength awaie from him. If I owe any thing, he ſhall paie it for me: if I haue deſerued death, he as a King ſhall pardon me, and deliuer me from priſon and death.
                        But heere is the woorſt, what maner of mother haue I beene? For, after that I by faith had receiued the name of a true mother, I became verie rude vnto thee my Sonne: becauſe that after I had conceiued and brought thee foorth, I left reaſon, and being ſubiect to my will, not taking heed vnto thee, I fell aſleepe, and gaue place to my great enimie, the which, in the night of ignorance, I being aſleepe, did ſteale thee from me craftilie, and in thy place ſhe did put hir child, which was dead, and ſo I did leeſe thee, which was a ſorowfull remorſe for me. Thus did I looſe thee my ſonne, by mine owne fault, becauſe I tooke no heed to keepe thee. Senſualitie my neighbour, I beeing in my beaſtlie ſleepe, did ſteale thee from me, and gaue to me hir child, which had no life in him, named ſinne, whome I ſaid I would not haue, but vtterlie did forſake him.
                        She affirmed, that he was mine owne, but I knew him to be hirs. For as ſoone as I came to the light of grace, which thou hadſt giuen me, then I knewe my glorie to be changed, when I ſaw the dead child not to be mine. For the ſame which was aliue, whom ſhe had taken awaie, was my child: ſo apparant was the change betweene Ieſus and ſinne. But now heere is a ſtrange thing, this old woman cauſeth me to keepe

this dead child, whome ſhe reporteth to be mine, and ſo will ſhe mainteine. O Salomon, thou true and wiſe Iudge, thou haſt heard this lamentable proceſſe, and ordeined to content the parties, that the child ſhould be diuided in two parts. The falſe woman agreeth it ſhould be ſo, but I remembring him to be mine owne ſonne, which was aliue, was rather content to leeſe him, than to ſee his bodie parted in twaine. For true and perfect loue is neuer content with the one halfe of that it loueth: rather I had therefore to weepe for the whole, than to recouer the one halfe without life. Alas noble Salomon, giue her the child which is aliue. For better it is for me to die, than to ſee my ſonne diuided. But my Lord, thou didſt better looke to it, than I. For thou ſeeing the anguiſh that I did ſuffer, and how I rather did forſake my right, than to behold ſuch cruelneſſe, thou ſaiedſt, This is the true mother, and ſo cauſed them to giue me my child againe, for whome before my hart was ſorowfull.
                        O ſweete Ieſus, thus haſt thou proued me, how much I loued thee: yea and when by ſinne I had loſt thee, yet didſt thou returne vnto me. Alas, how gentlie doeſt thou vouchſafe to come againe to hir, which being let by ſinne, could not keepe thee my ſweete child, my ſweete ſonne, my helper, my nouriſher, of whome I am an humble creature? Do not permit that euer I do leaue thee againe, for I do repent the time paſt.
                        Now come ſenſualitie with thy rablement of ſinnes, thou haſt no power to make me to receiue thy dead child. For my ſonne is ſtrong, and will defend me, he ſhall not permit that thou take him anie more awaie from me, his ſtrength is greater than anie others, therefore may I ſleepe and take reſt neere him. For all things well conſidered, he ſhall keepe me from thine aſſaults. O ſweete reſt of the mother, and the ſonne together, my ſweete child, my God, onlie vnto thee be the

honour and praiſe, for that euerie creature may ſee, how it hath pleaſed thee to call me (leſſe than nothing) a mother: and the more it is ſtrange and hard to be done, the more ought thy goodneſſe to haue praiſe for it. And further, thou haſt retained me for thy ſiſter, wherefore I acknowledge my ſelfe more bound, than to anie other creature.
                        Now I am ſiſter vnto thee, but ſo naughtie a ſiſter, that better it were for me that I were without the name, than I to forget the name of adoption in ſo noble a kindred, and alſo thy good and brotherlie behauiour towards me. I with pride did riſe againſt thee, and not remembring my faults, but going aſtraie from thee, did agree with Aaron my brother, being in will to giue iudgement againſt thy works; and folowing the example of Miriam, priuilie I grudged againſt thee, which thing cauſed me to haue remorſe in my conſcience. Alas right bountifull brother, and true Moſes, which doeſt all with goodneſſe and iuſtice, I haue eſteemed thy workes to be euen ſinne, being ſo bold to ſpeake euen raſhlie, ſaieng: Wherefore haſt thou maried a ſtrange woman? Thou giueſt vs a law, and puniſhment, if we do not fulfill it, and then thou wouldeſt not be bound to it, forbidding vs the thing which thou thy ſelfe doeſt.
                        For thou forbiddeſt vs to kill anie man, and thou doeſt kill, and ſpareſt none, of three thouſand, which thou commandedſt to be ſlaine. Further, God gaue vs in commandement by thee, that we ſhould not marrie the daughter of a ſtranger, yet thou tookeſt thy wife from among them. Alas my deere brother Moſes, with a great manie of theſe words, which I knowe to be fooliſh, with Aaron and Miriam, which is mine owne wit, I imbraided thee, wherof I repent. For the liuelie voice of God, rebukinglie tooke me vp before I went out of the place. What wouldeſt thou then of

my ſinne? Thou wouldeſt not haue me puniſhed, but rather wouldeſt my ſaluation and health, in aſking for me this great benefit, that it might pleaſe God to mitigate his iudgement, the which thing thou couldeſt not obtaine. Wherefore I became a Lazar, ſo that all that looked on mee might well ſaie, I had not beene wiſe: and for mine vncleannes and leproſie, I was put out from the tents and tabernacles, from among the people, becauſe the ſicke ſhould not infect ſuch as were whole. Oh what ſoule can haue a greater puniſhment, than to be baniſhed out of the companie of them which are holie in God! But what didſt thou my ſweet loue and brother, ſeeing my repentance? Thou prouidedſt that my penance was ſoone at an end, and with true loue madeſt meanes for me, wherevpon I returned to thee. O what brother would, in ſtead to puniſh his fooliſh ſiſter, ſo naturallie cleaue vnto hir? For iniurie, grudge, and great offence by hir committed, thou giueſt hir grace, and loue in recompenſe. Alas my brother, how exceeding is this thy loue? Much more is it than brotherhoode is bound to giue, to ſo poore and wretched a woman as I am. I haue done thee euill, and thou giueſt me good for it. I am thine, and thou ſaieſt, thou art mine: euen ſo I am, and euer will. I feare no more the great fooliſhneſſe of Aaron and Miriam, for no man may ſeparate me from thee; and now that we are together, as brother and ſiſter, I care little for all other, for thy land is mine inheritance.
                        Let vs then keepe, if it pleaſe thee, but one houſhold, ſith it hath pleaſed thee to humble thy ſelfe ſo much, as to ioine thy hart with mine, in making thy ſelfe a liuelie man. I do right hartilie thanke thee, and to thanke thee as I ought, lieth not in my power. Take my meaning then I praie thee, & excuſe mine ignorance, ſeeing I am of ſo great a kindred as to be thy ſiſter. O my

God, I haue good cauſe to loue, to praiſe, and to ſerue thee vnfeignedlie, and not to feare, nor deſire anie thing ſaue thee onlie. Keepe me well then I humblie praie thee, for I will aſke none other brother nor friend to helpe me. If anie father haue had anie pitie vpon his children; if anie mother haue taken anie care for hir ſonne; if anie brother haue hid the ſinne of his ſiſter, it is thou.
                     
                     
                        The fourth Chapter, Of the entier affection and loue of God towards the ſinfull ſoule of man.
                        
                        
                           
                              I
                            Neuer ſawe, or elſe it was kept wondrous ſecret, that euer anie huſband would thoroughlie forgiue his wife, after ſhe had him once offended, and did returne vnto him.
                        There haue beene manie of them, which for to auenge their wrongs, haue cauſed the Iudges to put them to death. Other, beholding their ſinnes, did not ſpare their owne hands to kill them. Other alſo, ſeeing their faults to appeare, did ſend them home again to their owne friends. And ſome, perceiuing their euill diſpoſitions, haue ſhut them vp in priſon. Now brieflie to conclude vpon their diuers complexions, the end of their pretence is puniſhment, and the leaſt harme that euer I could perceiue in puniſhing them, is this, that they would neuer ſee them againe. But I do wiſh, that all of this mind ſhould rather helpe to turne them, than to forſake them. And therfore my God, I can find no man comparable vnto thee: for of loue thou art the perfect example. Now therefore I confeſſe with lowlie hart, that I haue broken to thee mine oth & promiſe.
                        Alas, thou hadeſt choſen me for thy wife, and didſt ſet me vp in great ſtate and honour. For what greater honour may one haue, than to be in the place of thy

wife, which ſweetelie taketh hir reſt ſo neere to thee, and not onlie in ſuretie of ſoule and bodie, but alſo of all thy goodes, Queene, Miſtreſſe, and Ladie? O what great fauour is it, that I ſo vile a creature, am ſo ennobliſhed by thee to ſo honourable an huſband! Now to ſpeake it brieflie, I haue more by poſſeſſing of thee, than anie man mortall can deſire. Yet, when I remember mine vnwoorthie deſeruing, my hart doth ſob and ſigh, mine eies let fall abundance of teares, my mouth can not make too manie exclamations. For there is neither new nor ancient writings, that can ſhew ſo pitifull a caſe as the ſame is which I tell now. Shall, or dare I tell it? May I pronounce it without ſhame? Yea, for it is my confuſion, not to ſhew the great loue of my huſband: and for his worſhip to declare my fault.
                        O my ſauiour, which waſt crucified on the croſſe for my ſinnes, this deede of thine is not ſuch, as a father to leaue his ſonne, or as a child to offend his mother, or as a ſiſter to chide and grudge. But alas, my fault is ſuch, and far greater. For the more familiaritie I haue with thee, and the more benefits I receiue of thee, the greater is mine offence, when I with thee diſſemble; ſpeciallie that I ſhould ſo doo, which am called thy ſpouſe, and loued of thee as thy ſoule. Shall I now tell the truth? O my ſpouſe, I haue left thee, forgotten thee, and am run awaie from thee; I did leaue thee, for to go at my vaine pleaſure: I forſooke thee, and choſe me another: yea I refuſed thee the welſpring of all goodneſſe, and faithfull promiſe. I did leaue thee. But whither went I? Into a place where nothing was but curſedneſſe.
                        I haue left thee my truſtie friend and louer, worthie to be beloued aboue all others: I haue put thee aſide, O welſpring of all health ſomnes, by mine owne wretched will: yea I haue forſaken thee, full of beautie,

goodneſſe, wiſedome, and power, and ſought to withdrawe me from thy loue. I haue accepted thy great enimies, that is, the diuell, the world, and the fleſh, againſt whome for my ſake thou foughtedſt ſo ſore on the croſſe, to ſet me at libertie, which was by them of long time a priſoner and ſlaue, and ſo bound, that no man could cauſe me to humble my ſelfe. And as for the loue and charitie that I ſhould haue had towards thee, they did quench it; ſo that the name of Jeſus my deare huſband, which before I had found ſo ſweet, was to me tedious and hatefull, ſo that oftentimes I did ieſt at it: and when I haue heard the Goſpell preached or taught, the word which I haue hard, hath not tarried with me, but as a feather doth in the winde.
                        I went neuer yet to heare thy word preached, but for a faſhion onlie, which was a worke of hypocriſie: I was alſo annoied, when I hard ſpeake of thee, becauſe I was more willing to go at my pleaſure. Now brieflie to conclude, all that thou didſt forbid me, I fulfilled: and all that thou commandedſt me to do, I did eſchue, and this was the cauſe why I loued not thee. But yet Lord, for all that I did thus hate thee, and forſake thee, ran awaie from thee, and betraied thee, ſhould I giue place to anie other? Haſt thou ſuffered, that I ſhould be mocked, either yet beaten, or killed? Haſt thou put me in darke priſon, or baniſhed me for euer, ſetting naught by me? Haſt thou taken awaie thy gifts and pretious iewels againe from me, to puniſh me for my vnfaithfull fruits? Haue I loſt my iointure, which thou promiſedſt me, through mine owne offence done againſt thee? Am I accuſed by thee, afore the eternall father, for a naughtie woman? Haſt thou forbidden me thy preſence, as I haue deſerued, and that I ſhould neuer appeare in thine houſe?
                        O moſt true huſband, pure and perfect friend, the moſt louing among all louers! Alas, thou haſt done otherwiſe

for me. For thou haſt diligentlie ſought for me, when I was going into the moſt deepe place of Hell, where all euils are done. When I was fartheſt from thee, both in hart and mind, and directlie out of the waie, then didſt thou louinglie call me backe, ſaieng, My deare daughter, hearken and ſee, and vow thine eare toward me: forget that ſtrange nation, with whome thou haſt run aſtraie, and alſo the houſe of thine owne father, where thou haſt dwelt ſo long, and then ſhall the King of all faithfulneſſe deſire thy beautie. But when thou Lord ſaweſt, that thy ſweete and gratious calling did not profit me, then beganneſt thou to crie to me with a lowd voice, ſaieng: Come vnto me all you which are wearilie loden with labour, for I am he that ſhall plentiouſlie refreſh you, and feed you with the bread of life.
                        Alas, ſweet Lord, vnto all theſe ſweet words would I not hearken, but rather doubted whether it were thou, that ſo ſpake vnto me, or elſe a fabulous writing that ſo ſaid. I was ſo fooliſh, that without loue I read thy word: I conſidered not the compariſon of the Uineyard, which brought foorth thornes and briers in ſtead of good fruit, and that it ſignified me, that ſo had done. I knew alſo, that when thou didſt call the barren wife, ſaieng, Returne Shulamite, that thou didſt ſpeake it, that I ſhould forſake my ſinnes. Yet for all theſe words did I, as though I had vnderſtood neuer a whit. But when I had peruſed the Prophet Ieremie, I confeſſe that I had in the reading thereof, feare in my hart, and baſhfulneſſe in my face. I will tell it, yea with teares in mine eies, and all Lord for thine honor, & to ſuppreſſe my pride. Thou haſt ſaid by that holie Prophet: If a woman haue offended hir huſband, and is ſo left of him, for going aſtraie with other: if he therevpon refuſeth hir, is ſhe not to be eſteemed polluted, and of no value?
                        
                           
The lawe doth conſent to put hir in the hands of iuſtice, or to driue hir awaie, and ſo neuer to take hir againe. Thou haſt made a ſeparation betweene thy bed and mine, ſaith he vnto me, and placed forren louers in my roome, committing with them fornication: yet for all this, thou maiſt returne to me againe, for I will not alwaies be angrie againſt thee. Lift vp therfore thine eies, and looke about thee on euerie ſide, and then ſhalt thou well ſee, into what place thy ſinne hath lead thee, and how filthilie thou lieſt in the earth. O poore ſoule, looke where thy ſinne hath put thee, euen vpon the high waies, where thou didſt waite, and tarie to beguile them that came by, euen as a theefe doth, which is hidden in the wilderneſſe. Therefore thou, in fulfilling thy wicked pleaſure, haſt with fornication infected all the earth, which was about thee: thine eies, thy forehead, and thy face, haue loſt all their good maner, for they were ſuch as an harlot hath, and yet thou hadeſt no ſhame of thy ſinne.
                        And the ſurplus that Ieremie ſaith, conſtreineth me to knowe my wretched life, and to wiſh with ſorowfull ſighes, the houre, the moneth, the daie, the yeare, and time that my life might haue an end, yeelding my ſelfe condemned, and worthie to lie for euer in the euerlaſting fire. The ſame feare which proceedeth of thee, and not of my ſelfe, putteth me rather in hope, than in deſpaire, as often as I do remember my ſinne. For as ſoone as thou knoweſt my will, bowing vnder thine obedience, then putting in me a liuelie faith, thou didſt vſe great clemencie, ſo that after I knewe thee to be that ſame Lord, Maiſter, and King, whome I ought to haue feared, then found I my feare not quenched, but mixed with loue, beleeuing that thou art ſo gratious, gentle, and ſweete, and ſo pitifull an huſband, that I which ſhould rather haue hid me, than to haue ſhewed my ſelfe, was not then in feare to

go foorth, and to looke for thee, & ſo ſeeking, I found thee.
                        But what didſt thou then? Didſt thou refuſe me? No Lord, but rather haſt excuſed me. Haſt thou turned thy face from me? No, for thine eie ſo ſweetlie penetrated my hart, that wounding it almoſt to the death, it did giue to me remorſe of my ſinnes. Thou haſt not put me backe with thy hand: but with both thine armes, and with a ſweet and manlie hart, thou didſt meete with me by the waie, and not once reprouing my faults, embracedſt me. I could not ſee in beholding thy countenance, that euer thou didſt once perceiue mine offences: wherefore thou haſt done ſo much for me, as though I had neuer broken promiſe with thee. For thou didſt hide my fault from euerie bodie, in giuing me againe the part of thy bed, and alſo in ſhewing, that the multitude of my ſinnes are ſo hidden and ouercome by thy great victorie, that thou wilt neuer remember them more: ſo that now thou ſeeſt nothing in me, but the graces, gifts, and vertues, which it hath pleaſed thy free goodneſſe to giue me.
                        O charitie moſt pretious! I do ſee well, that thy goodneſſe doth conſume my lewdneſſe, and maketh me a new, godlie, and ioifull creature. The euill that was mine, thou haſt deſtroied, and made me ſo perfect a creature, that all the good a huſband can do to his wife, thou haſt done it to me, in giuing me a faithfull hope in thy promiſes. Now haue I through thy good grace, recouered the place of thy wife. O happie, and deſired place! O gratious bed! O thou right honourable ſeate of peace, reſt from all warre, high ſleepe of honour, ſeparate from the earth! Doeſt thou receiue this vnworthie creature, giuing hir the ſcepter and crowne of thine Empire and glorious Realme? Who did euer heare of ſuch a ſtorie, as to raiſe vp one ſo high, which of hir ſelfe was nothing; and maketh of great valure, which of it ſelfe was naught?
                     
                     
                        
                        The fift Chapter, Of the vnion of death and life in the faithfull ſoule by Chriſt.
                        
                        
                           ALas, what is this? For caſting mine eies on high, I ſee thy goodnes, thine vnknowne grace, and thy loue ſo incomprehenſible, that my ſight is woonderfull in beholding thee: but looking downeward, I might ſee what I am, and what I was willing to be. Alas, I do ſee in it the lewdeneſſe, darkeneſſe, and extreme deepenes of mine euils. My death, which by humblenes cloſeth mine eie: the admirable goodneſſe of thee, and the vnſpeakable euill, which is in me: thy right highnes, & pure maieſtie, my right fragill and mortall nature: thy gifts, goods & beatitude, my malice & great vnkindnes.
                        O how good art thou vnto me! and how vnking haue I bene vnto thee? this that thou wilt, and this that I purſue? Which things conſidered, cauſeth me to maruell, how it pleaſeth thee to ioine thy ſelfe to me, ſeeing there is no compariſon betweene vs both. Thou art my God, and I am thy worke: thou my creator, and I thy creature. Now to ſpeake brieflie, though I cannot define, what it is to be of thee; yet know I my ſelfe to be the leaſt thing that may be compared vnto thee. O moſt happie loue! Thou madeſt this agreement, when thou didſt ioine life & death together, but ye vnion hath made aliue death; life dieng, and life without end, haue made our death a life. Death hath giuen vnto life a quickning, yt through death I being dead, may receiue life; and by death, I am rauiſhed with him which is aliue. I liue in him, otherwiſe of my ſelf I am dead. And as concerning bodelie death, to me it is nothing, but a comming out of priſon: death is to me life, for through death, I am aliue. And as this mortall life filleth me full of care and ſorowe, ſo death yeeldeth me content.
                        
                           
O what a godlie thing is it to die, that the ſoule may liue! For in deliuering hir from this mortall death, ſhe is deliuered from the death miſerable, and matched with hir moſt mightie louer. Is not then the ſoule blameleſſe, which faine would by to haue life? Yes trulie, and ought to call death hir welbeloued friend. O ſweet death, pleaſant ſorowe, mightie king, deliuering from all wickednes! O Lord, thoſe which truſt in thee, and in thy death, are mortified by the hope they haue in thy paſſion.
                        Thus with a ſweet ſleepe doſt thou put them out of that death, which cauſeth manie to lament. O how happie is the ſame ſleepe vnto him, which when he awaketh, doth find through thy death, life euerlaſting! For death is none other thing to a Chriſtian man, but a libertie or deliuerance from his mortall band: and the death which is fearefull to the wicked, is pleaſant and acceptable to them that are good, bicauſe that death through death is deſtroied.
                        Therefore my God, if I were rightlie taught, I ſhould call death life, the end of labour, and beginning of euerlaſting ioie. For I knowe that long life doth let me from the ſight of thee. O death come and doe thine office on me, that I may ſee my ſpouſe: or elſe ſweet loue, tranſforme me in thee, and then ſhall I the better tarie the comming of death! O ſweet Lord, let me die, that I may liue with thee! For there is none other that can deliuer me, but thou onelie. O my Sauiour, through faith I am planted and ioined with thee. O what vnion is this, ſith that through faith I am aſſured to thee, and may call thee father, brother, ſonne, and huſband!
                        O my father! what paternitie? O my brother! what fraternitie? O my child! what delectation? O my ſpouſe! what coniunction is this? A father full of humilitie, a brother hauing our ſimilitude, a ſonne engendred

through faith and loue, a huſband louing and releeuing in all extremitie. But whom doſt thou loue? Alas, it is ſhe whom thou haſt withdrawne from the ſnare, wherin through malice ſhe was bound, and haſt put hir in place, name, and office of a daughter, ſiſter, mother, and wife. O my Sauiour, it is a great ſauour of ſweetneſſe, right pleaſant, and delectable; when a ſoule after the hearing of thy word, ſhall cal thee without feare, his father, his brother, child and ſpouſe: ſuch a ſoule doubtleſſe may continuallie burne in loue.
                        Is there anie loue, vnleſſe it be this maner of loue, but it hath ſome euill condition? Is there anie pleaſure to be hereto compared? Is there anie honour to this, but may be accounted ſhame? Yea, is there anie profit equall to this? Moreouer to conclude, is there any thing, that I could more earneſtlie loue? Alas no. For he that vnfeinedlie loueth God, reputeth all theſe things wordlie, of leſſe valure than the dunghill. Pleaſure, profit, and honour of this world, are all but vanitie and trifles vnto him which hath found God. Such loue is ſo profitable, honourable, & abundant in grace, that I dare ſaie, ſhe onlie ſufficeth the hart of a godlie ſoule, and yeeldeth hir ſo conſtant, that ſhe neuer deſireth, or would haue other. For whoſoeuer hath God, as he ought to be had, accounteth all other things ſuperfluous or vaine.
                        Now thanked be my Lord, and my father; through faith I haue gotten the ſame loue: wherfore I ought to be ſatiſfied and content. Now haue I thee my father, for defence of my want on fooliſhnes, and my long youth. Now haue I thee my brother, for to ſuccour my ſorowes, wherein I find no end. Now haue I thee my ſonne, for my feeble age, as an onlie ſtaie. Now haue I thee a true and faithfull huſband, for the ſatiſfieng of my whole hart. And now, ſith I haue thee, I will, and doo forſake all them that are in the world, holding thee

faſt, that thou maieſt no more eſcape me. Seeing now that I haue poſſeſſed thee, I will look vpon none other thing, that might keepe me backe, from the beholding of thy diuinitie. Seeing that I doo heare thee, I will heare nothing that letteth me from the fruition of thy voice. Seeing that I may freelie talke with thee, I will common with none other. Seeing it pleaſeth thee to put me ſo neere thee, I will rather die, than to touch anie other: and ſeeing I ſerue thee, I will ſerue none other. Seeing that thou haſt ioined thy hart with mine, if it depart from thee, let it be puniſhed for euer. For the departing from thy loue is harder than any damnation. I doo not feare the paine of ten thouſand hels, as I doo feare the once looſing of thee.
                        Alas my God, my Father, and Creator, doo not thou ſuffer that the enimie, inuenter of all ſinne, haue anie power to make mee to looſe thy preſence. For whoſoeuer ſhall feele the loſſe of thy loue, ſhall ſaie, he would rather be bound for euer in hell, than to feele the paine thereof one moment of time. O my Sauiour, doo thou not permit, that euer I depart from thee againe; but that it may pleaſe thee, to put me in ſuch a place, that my ſoule, through wantonneſſe of ſinne, be neuer ſeparated from thy loue.
                     
                     
                        The ſixt Chapter, Of the longing of the ſoule, by death to feede with Chriſt.
                        
                        
                           IN this world I can not perfectlie haue this my deſire; which thing maketh mee feruentlie to deſire the departing from this bodie of ſinne, not fearing death, nor anie of hir inſtruments. For what feare ought I to haue of my God, which through loue offered himſelfe, and ſuffered death, not of debt, or dutie;

but onlie bicauſe he would, for my ſake, vnder the power of mortall death? Now is Ieſus dead, in whom we are all dead, and through his death we all ſhall liue: I meane thoſe, which through faith are partakers of his paſſion. For euen as the death, before the great myſterie of the croſſe, was hard to euerie man, & there was no man but was feared therewith, conſidering the copulation of the bodie, and the ſoule, their order, loue, and agreement; ſo were their ſorowes extreme, in departing of the one from the other.
                        But ſince it hath pleaſed the ſweet Lambe to offer himſelfe vpon the croſſe, his great loue hath kindled a fire within the hart, ſo vehement, that euerie true beleeuer eſteemeth the paſſage of death but a plaie, or paſtime, and ſo prouoketh other conſtantlie to die. And euen as the feare of death doth retrograde vs: ſo ought loue to giue vs a deſire to die. For if true loue be vnfainedlie within the hart of man, he can feele none other thing; bicauſe loue is ſo ſtrong of it ſelfe, that ſhe keepeth all the room, and putteth out all other deſires, ſuffering nothing there but God onlie. For whereſoeuer true and perfect loue is, there is remembred neither feare, nor ſorowe: yet our owne pride to attaine honour, cauſeth vs to ſeeke death by manie ſtrange waies. As if a man, to haue his fooliſh pleaſure, putteth himſelfe in ieopardie of life: if a merchant, to obtaine riches, doth danger himſelfe ſomtime for a ſmall value: if the theefe, conceiuing of roberie, or murther, crueltie, or deceit, doth ſo blind a man, that he doubteth nothing the danger of death, neither yet miſfortune, when he ſeeketh to aduenge himſelfe, or doth any other euill: if the furie of ſickneſſe, or the rankeneſſe of melancholie, cauſeth a man fiercelie to wiſh for death, or oftentimes to drowne, hang, or kill themſelues. Such euils are ſometimes ſo great, that they cauſe their pained patient to chooſe death for libertie. If it

ſo be then, that theſe paines full of euils and imperfections, cauſe them not to feare the hazard of death, but rather to thinke that death tarieth too long: alas, what ought true & laudable loue to doo? What ought the loue of the eternall creature to wiſh? Should ſhe ſtir a hart in ſuch wiſe, that ſhe being maiſtered with ſuch affections, ſhould feele none other thing in hir? Alas yea. For death is a pleaſant thing to the ſoule, which is in loue with God, and eſteemeth the paſſage eaſie, thorough the which ſhe commeth out of priſon. For the hard waie, where through ſhe commeth, can be no let for hir to embrace hir huſband. O my Sauiour, how good and pleaſant is the ſame death, through whom I ſhall haue the end of all ſorowes: & by whom I ſhall enioie thy ſight without impediment, and be tranſformed into the likeneſſe of thy maieſtie!
                        O death, through thy force I truſt to haue ſuch honour, as vpon my knees with crieng and weeping I dailie doo deſire. Therefore come quicklie, and make an end of my ſorowes. O happie daughters, right holie ſoules, ioined to the citie Ieruſalem, open your eies, and with pitie looke vpon my deſolation! I beſeech you, that for me, and in my name, ye doo ſhew vnto my deere and beſt beloued, my God, my friend, & my King, how that euerie houre of the daie I doo languiſh for his preſence. O ſweet death, come vnto me, and louinglie bring me vnto my Lord God. O death, where is now thy ſting and dart? Alas, are they baniſhed from mine eies? Is not rigour changed into ſweetneſſe, ſeeing that for my ſake, my friend did ſuffer vpon the croſſe, whoſe death doth ſo encourage me, that death I wiſh to followe him?

                           SIth then that death is ſo pleaſant to me, that it pleaſeth me more than it feareth me; then ought I to feare nothing, but onlie the right iudgement of GOD. My ſinnes with his iuſt ballance ſhall be weied, and all that I haue done, openlie ſhall be ſhewed: my thoughts and words ſhall be better knowne, than they were written in a roll. Wherefore I may not thinke, that charitie would offend iuſtice and truth. For certaine it is, whoſoeuer liueth vnfaithfullie, ſhall be puniſhed in euerlaſting paine. For God is iuſt, and his iudgement righteous, and all that he doth is perfect in all things. What am I then, conſidering mine owne righteouſneſſe? A wretch and poore creature.
                        I knowe that all the works of iuſt men, are ſo full of imperfection, that afore God, they are more filthie than mire, or other vileneſſe. What will it be then, concerning the ſins which I haue committed, whereof I feele the burden importable? I can nothing elſe ſaie, but that I haue woon by them damnation. Is this the end? Shall deſpaire then be the comfort of my great ignorance? Alas my God, no? For the inuiſible faith cauſeth me to beleeue, that all things, which are impoſſible to man, are poſſible vnto thee; ſo that thou doo conuert my worke, which is nothing, into ſome good worke of thine in me, which is ſpeciallie faith. Then my Lord, who ſhall condemne me? Or what Iudge will damne me? Sith that thou, which art my Iudge, art alſo my father, my ſpouſe, and my refuge. Alas, what father? Such as doth neuer condemne his child: but alwaies doth excuſe and defend

him.
                        Then I perceiue to haue none other excuſer, but Ieſus Chriſt, which is my ſpouſe, and my redeemer, whoſe death hath reſtored me my loſt inheritance. For he made himſelfe my man of lawe, ſhewing his ſo worthie merits afore his father, wherewith my great debt is ſo aboundantlie recompenſed, that in iudgement it is nothing. O redeemer, here is a great loue: I find but few ſuch men of lawe. O ſweete Ieſus, it is to thee that I am a debtor, yet doeſt thou both praie and ſpeake for me. And moreouer, when thou doeſt ſee that I am poore, with the aboundance of thy goods thou doeſt paie my debts. O incomprehenſible ſea of all goodneſſe! O my deare father, doeſt thou vouchſafe to be my Iudge, not willing the death of a ſinner? O Ieſus Chriſt crucifier and ſauiour of the ſoule, friend aboue all friends: thou being my man of law, didſt excuſe and ſpeake for me, where thou couldſt iuſtlie haue accuſed mee.
                        I feare no more therefore the crueltie of mine enimie, for the lawe by thee is ſatiſfied for all: the paiment is ſo made by my ſweete ſpouſe, that the lawe can aſke nothing of me, but it is paid by him. For as I beleeue, that he hath taken all my ſinnes vpon him, and hath giuen me in place of them his owne goodes in aboundance: ſo, O my Sauiour, thou preſenting thy vertues, doeſt content the lawe. And when ſhe will reproch me of my ſinnes, thou doeſt ſhew hir how willinglie, in thine owne fleſh, thou haſt taken the diſcharge of them, through the coniunction of our mariage. Alſo vpon the Croſſe, through thy paſſion, thou haſt made ſatiſfaction for it. Morouer, thine onlie charitie hath giuen me this, that thou haſt for me deſerued. Therefore, ſeeing thy merite to be mine, the lawe can aſke nothing of me. Now then will I feare no more the iudgement, but with deſire, more than with

perforce, I will tarrie the time that I ſhall ſee my Iudge, and heare a iuſt iudgement of him.
                        I knowe that thy iudgement is iuſt, and that there is no fault therein, though mine infidelitie is woorthie to ſuffer the cruelneſſe of hell. For if I do onlie conſider my deſeruing, yet I can ſee nothing in it that can keepe me from the fire of hell. For true it is, that the torment of hell was prepared for the Diuell and his children. So if anie man haue ſet his minde, to be like to the Diuell, by ſenſuall appetite, then ought he, as the Diuell, to be paid with a like reward. But if a man through contemplation of the ſoule, do hold of thee, his Angell of counſell, vertue, and perfection, he is ſure to obtaine heauen, which is a place of thy deſeruing for him: then ſhall the wicked be puniſhed, with the ſame puniſhment, which they ought to haue, to whom they haue ioined themſelues. For ſith they folowed Satan, they muſt enioie ſuch place as is for him, and his Angels prepared.
                        Now I, conſidering the diuerſitie of both the ſorts, am little comforted in ſpirit by this. For I cannot denie, but that I am more like the Diuell, than the Angell of light: wherefore I feare and tremble. For as the Angell is pure and perfect, ſo am I vnpure and vnperfect, and am nothing like vnto him. But thus I confeſſe, that to the other I am ſo like in my dooings, and ſo accuſtomed in his waies, that of his paine and torment I ought to be partaker. For the cruell ſinne which hath bound me in hell, is ſo great, and his force ſo ſtrong, that it letteth nothing to come from it, neither feareth it the contrarie aſſault. But he, whoſe force lieth in this kind of ſtrength, knoweth not how his ſtrength goeth awaie, when a ſtronger than he commeth in place.
                        I could neuer yet ſee, that anie man by merite, or paines taking, could euer yet vanquiſh that hell, ſaue

onlie he, which did the great aſſault through his vnſpeakable charitie, when he humbled himſelfe to the croſſe, whereby he hath vanquiſhed and ouercome his enimie, and robbed hell of his power: ſo that now, it hath no more force and ſtrength to keepe that ſoule, which putteth hir truſt in God. Then beleeuing in the great ſtrength that my ſauiour hath, I do not ſet by hell and ſinne. For ſinne can haue no hold of me, vnles it be to ſhew how my God is mercifull, ſtrong, mightie, and a puiſſant vanquiſher of all the euils within my hart. If by ſinnes forgiueneſſe, is the glorie of my moſt louing ſauiour: then ought I alſo to beleeue, that my glorie is increaſed by his loue, and that I am planted and graffed in him.
                        His honour onlie doth honour all his, and his riches doo repleniſh euerie one with his goods. Then death, hell, and ſinne are ouercome by him. O gluttonous hell! where is thy defence? Thou cruell villaine ſinne, where is thy tyrannous power? O Death! where is thy ſting, and victorie, which are ſo much ſpoken of? Inſtead of death, thou death giueſt me life, and ſo doeſt thou contrarie to thy will. Alſo, thou ſinne coueteſt to drawe each creature to damnation. Thou giueſt me a ladder, to reach thereby that godlie Citie Ieruſalem: yet wouldſt thou of thy curſed nature, that mine eternall maker ſhould looſe his creature: but through his loue and grace, the ſorie remembrance of thine vncomlineſſe, doth cauſe hir by repentance againe to come, and ſubmit hir ſelfe vnto God, whoſe ineſtimable goodneſſe cauſeth thee to looſe thy whole labour, which thou takeſt in hand. For the number that thou pretendeſt to haue, thou ſhalt not haue, becauſe that the comfortable ſhadowe of Chriſt his paſſion, is ſuch a mightie protection to the ſoule, that he needeth neither to doubt death, ſinne, nor hell. Is there anie thing then, that can pull me backe, if God be willing, through the

gift of faith to drawe me to him? I meane ſuch a faith, as we muſt needes haue, to obtaine the high graces from aboue: and alſo ſuch a faith, as through charitie doth ioine the humble ſeruant to his maker. Now I being ioined vnto him, ought to haue no feare of trauell, paine, nor ſorowe. For whoſoeuer doth willinglie ſuffer anie maner of death, paine, or ſorowe, for the truth, as Chriſt did, he ſhall feele in ſuch torment, great comfort & conſolation for his ſoule: knowing all this, I my ſelf am weake, yet with God I am right ſtrong.
                        Through his comfort I may do all things, and his loue is ſo conſtant, and permanent, that it varieth not for anie worldlie thing. Who can then withdrawe me from his grace? Surelie the great height of heauen, the depth of hell, the breadth of the whole earth, neither death, nor ſinne, which dailie doth warre againſt me, can ſeparate me one minute from the great loue and charitie, that my heauenlie father, through Ieſus Chriſt, hath vnto me. His goodneſſe is ſuch, that he loueth me, which hath not all times loued him; and if I now loue hun, then ſhall I feele his loue increaſe in me. But becauſe my loue is not a worthie loue to him, I deſire his loue to be mine, which I feele ſuch as it were mine owne: his deſire is to loue, and his loue inflameth my hart with a heauenlie loue.
                        And through ſuch loue, he findeth himſelfe, that his owne deede yeeldeth him well content, and not my loue or ſtrength: thus contenting himſelfe, his loue doth more increaſe in me, than I can of him deſire.
                     
                     
                        The eight Chapter, Of the incomprehenſible loue of Chriſt to the ſinfull ſoule: and benefits that come of a true faith.
                        
                           O True louer, the fountaine or welſpring of all charitie, and onlie purſe of the heauenlie treaſure! Ought I to thinke, or dare I ſaie what

thou art? May I write, or can anie mortall man comprehend thy goodneſſe, or loue? And if thou print in mans hart, can he expreſſe it? No ſurelie. For the capacitie of man cannot comprehend the vnmeaſurable goodneſſes which are in thee. For naturall reaſon doth ſhew vs, how there is no compariſon betweene an eternall and a mortall thing: but when through loue the mortall is ioined with the eternall, the mortall thing is ſo filled with the eternall, that it cannot find the end thereof: for it hath more good thereby, than it can conteine or hold. Therfore doth man thinke, which hath one ſparke of the loue of God, that he hath all the world therewith: euen as we ſee the Sunne, with one onlie ſparke of his light, doth blinde the eie, and yet doth he withhold from it his great light. If then you ſhould aſke the eie, what it hath ſeene, he would ſaie, that it hath beholden the whole brightnes of the ſame. Neuertheleſſe, he is ſo content, that it ſeemeth vnto him as though he had ſo much light as the Sunne conteineth, which if he had more than the ſaid ſparke, he were not able to ſuffer it. Euen ſo the ſoule, which through faith doth feele one ſparke of the loue of God, doth finde therewith the heate ſo great and maruellous, ſo ſweet and delicious, that it is impoſſible to hit to declare what thing the ſame loue is. For the little thereof, that ſhe hath felt, doth yeeld hir mind ſatiſfied, and yet deſiring more, where of ſhe hath ynough: thus doth ſhe liue, languiſhing and ſighing in hir ſelfe.
                        The hart that doth feele that he hath receiued too much, hath conceiued ſuch a deſire in this too much, that he alwaies deſireth to receiue the thing which he cannot haue, neither is he worthie to receiue it. He knoweth not the good that he hath alreadie to be vnſpeakable, yet would he haue more of that, where of he cannot ſkill: trulie he cannot feele or thinke the good which is in him. Then lieth it not in my power, to tell

what thing the loue of God is, ſith I haue no knowledge of the feruentneſſe thereof. He that thinketh to haue all this loue within his hart, can not trulie declare what thing it is: happie is he therefore which hath ſuch aboundance of this loue, that he may ſaie, My God, I haue ynough of it.
                        He which hath this loue within him, dare not much boaſt thereof, leaſt in much ſpeaking he do looſe it, vnleſſe he do it, to edifie his neighbour to ſaluation. The impoſſiblitie then of the declaration of this loue, ſhall make me hold my peace. For there is no ſainct ſo perfect, if he will ſpeake of the loue of the high God, of his goodnes, ſweetnes, graces, and of all things elſe, which pertaine to him, but looking a lowe, ſhall find himſelfe vnworthy, and ſo ſtop his mouth. I then, a worme of the earth, leſſe than nothing, ought to ceaſe, and not to ſpeake of the incomparable highneſſe of this loue: yet were it too much vnkindneſſe to be noted in me, if I had written nothing, hauing that done vnto me, which would ſatiſfie a much better wit than mine is. For hee that would hide the goodneſſe of God, ſo good a maiſter, ſhould commit a ſin worthie to be puniſhed with euerlaſting paine.
                        Therefore come O happie Paule, which haſt taſted ſo much of the ſame ſweet honnie, beeing blind for the ſpace of three daies, and rapt vp into the third heaven, and ſatiſfie (I beſeech thee) mine ignorance, and tell me what in ſuch viſion thou haſt ſeene? Harken then what he ſaith. O the vnſpeakable highnes of the aboundant riches or treaſure, both of the wiſdome and knowledge of God! How incomprehenſible are his iudgements, and how vnſearchable are his waies vnto our weake wits? O holie Paule, thy words cauſe me much to maruell, that thou hauing knowledge, and ſo heauenlie ſecrets, wouldeſt ſpeake no further in them. At the leaſt yet tell thou me, what thing I may hope to

haue, throgh ſuch godlie loue, as grace hath wrought in me; and I will giue eare vnto thy words: neither hath the eie ſeene, nor yet the eare heard, neither yet hath it euer entred into the hart of man, what GOD hath prepared for them that loue him. O bleſſed Paul, all this yet that thou haſt ſaid, is for none other purpoſe, but to prouoke me earneſtlie to loue, willing me by thy words to thinke, that thou canſt none otherwiſe declare of it, and ſo giue mine hart to patience, and hope of that thing, which neuer man yet could ſee, or yet deſerue, although manie through loue haue died.
                        O excellent gift of faith, whereof ſo much good commeth, that it cauſeth man to poſſeſſe the things which he can not comprehend! For faith, ioined with truth, bringeth foorth hope, whereby perfect charitie is engendred: and charitie is God, as witneſſeth the Apoſtle. If we haue charitie, then haue we alſo God therewith, and then is God in vs, and we in him; and all this commeth of the benefit of faith. For he dwelleth in all men, which haue true faith. Thus haue we a greater treaſure than we can tell of, nor yet anie man expreſſe vnto vs.
                        Now to conclude, ſith that ſo great an Apoſtle, as is S. Paule, will ſpeake no further of God, and his ineſtimable loue; I will (according to his righteous example and doctrine) hold my peace and be ſtill, following neuertheleſſe his teachings. Notwithſtanding, though herein I acknowledge my ſelfe but earth and duſt, yet may I not faile to yeeld thanks to mine eternall, and liuing God, for ſuch great graces and benefits, as it hath pleaſed him to giue me. Unto that euerlaſting King of heauen, immortall, inuiſible, incomprehenſible, mightie and wiſe, onlie to him be all honour, praiſe, glorie, magnificence and loue, for euer and euer:

                        MOſt gentle and Chriſtian Reader, if matters ſhould bee rather confirmed by their reporters, than the reports warranted by the matters, I might iuſtlie bewaile our time, wherin euill deeds be well worded, and good acts euill cleaped. But ſincere truth is, that things be not good for their praiſes; but be praiſed for their goodneſſe. I doo not mooue thee to like this Chriſtan Treatiſe, bicauſe I haue mind to praiſe it; but I exhort thee to mind it, and for the goodnes thou ſhalt allow it, for whoſe liking I labour not to obteine, onelie mooued by mine example, their iudgement Iregard, chieflie confirmed by the matter. Trulie our time is ſo diſpoſed to grant good names to euill fruits, and excellent termes to meane works, that neither can good deeds enioie their due names being defrauded by the euill, neither excellent works can poſſeſſe their woorthie termes, being foreſtalled by the meane: inſomuch that men ſeeke rather how much they can, than how much they ought to ſaie, inclining more to their pleaſure, than to their iudgement, and to ſhew themſelues rather eloquent, than the matter good: ſo that neither the goodnes of the cauſe can mooue them to ſaie more, neither the euilnes leſſe. For if the excellencie of

this Chriſtian contemplation, either for the goodnes herein to maruell appearing, either for the profit herevpon to the Reader enſuing, ſhould be with due commendation followed, I of neceſſitie ſhould either trauell to find out new words, the old being anticipated by euill matters, or wiſh that the common ſpeech of praiſing were ſpared vntill conuenient matters were found to ſpend it: ſuch is the plentie of praiſing, and ſcarſenes of deſeruing.
                     Wherefore lacking the maner in words, and not the matter in deed of high commendation, I am compelled to keepe in my iudgment with ſilence, truſting whom my report could not haue mooued to like this preſent Treatiſe, the woorthineſſe of the matter ſhall compell to giue it honour.
                     Anie earthlie man would ſoone be ſtirred to ſee ſome myſterie of magike, or practiſe of Alchumie, or perchance ſome inchantment of elements; but thou which art chriſtened, haſt here a woonderfull myſterie of the mercie of God; a heauenlie practiſe of regeneration; a ſpirituall inchantment of the grace of God. If ioie and triumph be ſhewed when a kings child is borne to the world; what ioie is ſufficient when Gods child is regenerated from heauen? The one is fleſh, which is borne of fleſh; the other is ſpirit, which is borne of ſpirit. The one alſo ſhall wither like the graſſe of the earth in ſhort time; the other ſhall liue in heauen beyond all time. If the finding of one loſt ſheepe be more ioifull, than the hauing of ninetie and nine; what ioie is it to conſider the returne of a ſtraie child of almightie God, whoſe returne teacheth the ninetie and nine to come to their fold? Euen ſuch cauſe of ioie is this, that the Angels in heauen take comfort herein. Be thou therefore ioifull when a noble child is newlie borne; ſhew thy ſelfe glad when the loſt ſheepe hath wonne the whole flocke: be thou not ſad, wherein Angels reioiſe.
                     Here maiſt thou ſee one, if the kind may mooue thee, a woman; if degree may prouoke thee, a woman of high eſtate; by birth, made noble; by marriage, moſt noble; by wiſedome, godlie; by a mightie King, an excellent Queene; by a famous HENRIE, a renowmed KATHERINE; a wife to him that was a King to Realmes: refuſing the world, wherein ſhe was loſt, to obtaine heauen, wherein ſhe may be ſaued: abhorring ſinne, which made hir bound, to receiue grace, whereby ſhe may be free: deſpiſing fleſh the cauſe

of corruption, to put on the ſpirit the cauſe of ſanctification: forſaking ignorance wherein ſhe was blind, to come to knowledge, whereby ſhe may ſee: remoouing ſuperſtition, wherewith ſhe was ſmothered, to imbrace true religion, wherewith ſhe may reuiue.
                     The fruit of this Treatiſe (good Reader) is thine amendment: this onelie had, the writer is ſatiſfied. This good Ladie thought no ſhame to deteſt hir ſinne, to obteine remiſſion; no vilenes, to become nothing; to be a member of him, which is all things in all; no follie to forget the wiſedome of the world, to learne the ſimplicitie of the Goſpell at the laſt; no diſpleaſantneſſe to ſubmit hir ſelfe to the ſchoole of the croſſe, the learning of the Crucifix, the booke of our redemption; the verie abſolute librarie of Gods mercie and wiſedome. This waie thought ſhe hir honour increaſed, and hir ſtate permanent, to make hir earthlie honour heauenlie, and neglect the tranſitorie for the euerlaſting.
                     Of this I would thee warned, that the profit may enſue. Theſe great myſteries and graces be not well perceiued, except they be ſurelie ſtudied; neither be they perfectlie ſtudied, except they be diligentlie practiſed; neither profitablie practiſed, without amendment. See and learne hereby what ſhe hath doone, then maiſt thou practiſe, and amend that thou canſt doo: ſo ſhalt thou practiſe with eaſe, hauing a guide, and amend with profit, hauing a zeale. It is eaſier to ſee theſe, than to learne: begin at the eaſieſt to come to the harder; ſee thou hir confeſſion, that thou maieſt learne hir repentance; practiſe hir perſeuerance, that thou maieſt haue like amendment; deſpiſe thy ſelfe in eſchewing vice, that thou maieſt pleaſe God in asking grace: let not ſhame hinder the confeſſion, which hindered not the offenſe. Be thou ſure if we knowledge our ſinnes, God is faithfull to forgiue vs, and to clenſe vs from all vnrighteouſnes. Obeie the Prophets ſaieng; Declare thy waies to the Lord.
                     
                     Thus far thou maiſt learne to knowe thy ſelfe; next this be thou as diligent to releeue thy ſelfe in Gods mercie, as thou haſt beene to reueale thy ſelfe in thine owne repentance. For God hath concluded all things vnder ſinne, bicauſe he would haue mercie vpon all, who hath alſo borne our ſinnes in his bodie vpon the tree, that we ſhould be deliuered from ſinne, and ſhould liue vnto righteouſnes, by whoſe ſtripes we be healed. Here is our anchor; here is our

                        ſhepheard; here we be made whole; here is our life, our redemption, our ſaluation and our bliſſe: let vs therefore now feed by this gratious Queenes example, & be not aſhamed to become in confeſſion Publicanes, ſince this noble Ladie will be no Phariſie.
                     
                     
                        And to all Ladies of eſtate I wiſh as earneſt mind to followe our Queene in vertue, as in honour, that they might once appeare to prefer God before the world, and be honourable in religion, which now be honourable in vanities; ſo ſhall they, as in ſome vertuous Ladies of right high eſtate, it is with great comfort ſeene, taſte of this freedome of remiſſion of the euerlaſting bliſſe, which exceedeth all thoughts and vnderſtandings, and is prepared for the holie in ſpirit. For the which let vs with our interceſſion in holines and purenes of life, offer our ſelues to the heauenlie father an vndefiled hoſt: to whom be eternall praiſe and glorie throughout the earth without end,
                     
                     Amen.
                  
                  
                     
                     The Lamentation or Complaint of a ſinner, made by the most vertuous and right gratious Ladie Queene CATHERINE, bewailing the ignorance of hir blind life, led in ſuperſtition: verie profitable to the amendment of our liues.
                     
                     
                        The firſt Chapter, Of an humble confeſsion of ſinnes to the glorie of God.
                        
                        
                           WHEN I conſider, in the bethinking of mine euil and wretched former life, mine obſtinate, ſtonie, and vntractable heart, to haue ſo much exceeded in euilneſſe, that it hath not onelie neglected, yea contemned, & deſpiſed Gods holie precepts and commandements: but alſo imbraced, receiued, and eſteemed vaine, fooliſh, and feined trifles, I am partlie by the hate I owe to ſinne, who hath reigned in me, and partlie by the loue I owe to all Chriſtians, whom I am content to edifie, euen with the example of mine owne ſhame, forced and conſtrained with my hart and words, to confeſſe and declare to the world, how ingrate, negligent, vnkind, and ſtubborne I haue beene to God my Creator: and how beneficiall, mercifull, and gentle he hath been alwaies to me his creature, being ſuch a miſerable and wretched ſinner.
                        Trulie I haue taken no little ſmall thing vpon me, firſt to ſet foorth my whole ſtubborneſſe, and contempt

in words, the which is incomprehenſible in thought (as it is in the 12. Pſalme) Who vnderſtandeth his faults? Next this, to declare the excellent beneficence, mercie, and goodneſſe of God, which is infinite, and vnmeaſurable. Neither can all the words of Angels, and men, make relation thereof, as apperteineth to his moſt high goodneſſe. Who is he that is not forced to confeſſe the ſame, if he conſider what he hath receiued of God, & doth dailie receiue? Yea, if men would not acknowledge and confeſſe the ſame, the ſtones would crie it out. Trulie I am conſtrained and forced to ſpeake and write thereof, to mine owne confuſion and ſhame; but to the glorie and praiſe of God. For he, as a louing father, of moſt abundant and high goodneſſe, hath heaped vpon me innumerable benefits: and I contrarie, haue heaped manifold ſinnes, deſpiſing that which was good, holie, pleaſant, and acceptable in his ſight, and chooſing that which was delicious, pleaſant, and acceptable in my ſight.
                        And no maruell it was that I ſo did. For I would not learne to knowe the Lord, and his waies; but loued darkneſſe better than light, yea darkneſſe ſeemed to me light. I embraced ignorance, as perfect knowledge; and knowledge ſeemed to me ſuperfluous and vaine. I regarded little Gods word, but gaue my ſelfe to vanities, and ſhadowes of the world. I forſooke him in whom is all truth; and followed the vaine fooliſh imaginations of my hart. I would haue couered my ſinnes with the pretence of holineſſe: I called ſuperſtition godlie meaning, and true holineſſe errour. The Lord did ſpeake manie pleaſant and ſweet words vnto me, and I would not heare: he called me diuerſlie, but through frowardneſſe I would not anſwere.
                        Mine euils and miſeries be ſo manie, and ſo great, that they can accuſe me euen to my face. Oh how miſerablie and wretchedlie am I confounded, when for

the multitude and greatneſſe of my ſinnes I am compelled to accuſe my ſelfe! Was it not a maruellous vnkindneſſe, when God did ſpeake to me, and alſo call me, that I would not anſwere him? What man ſo called would not haue heard? Or what man hearing, would not haue anſwered? If an earthlie Prince had ſpoken, either called, I ſuppoſe there be none but would willinglie haue done both. Now therefore, what a wretch and caitife am I, that when the Prince of princes, the King of kings, did ſpeake manie pleaſant and gentle words vnto me, and alſo called me ſo manie and ſundrie times, that they can not be numbred: and yet, notwithſtanding theſe great ſignes and tokens of loue, I would not come vnto him, but hid my ſelfe out of his ſight, ſeeking manie crooked and biwaies, wherin I walked ſo long, that I had cleane loſt his ſight? And no maruell or woonder. For I had a blind guide called Ignorance, who dimmed ſo mine eies, that I could neuer perfectlie get anie ſight of the faire, goodlie, ſtreight, and right waies of his doctrine: but continuallie trauelled vncomfortablie, in foule, wicked, crooked, and peruerſe waies. Yea, and bicauſe they were ſo much haunted of manie, I could not thinke, but that I walked in the perfect and right waie, hauing more regard to the number of the walkers, than to the order of the walking: beleeuing alſo moſt aſſuredly, with companie to haue walked to heauen, wheras I am moſt ſure they would haue brought me down to hell.
                        I forſooke the ſpirituall honouring of the true liuing God, and worſhipped viſible idols, and images made of mens hands, beleeuing by them to haue gotten heauen: yea, to ſaie the truth, I made a great idole of my ſelfe. For I loued my ſelfe better than God. And certainlie, looke how manie things are loued, or preferred in our harts before God, ſo manie are taken and eſteemed

for idols, and falſe gods. Alas, how haue I violated this holie, pure, and moſt high precept and commandment of the loue of God? Which precept bindeth me to loue him with my whole hart, mind, force, ſtrength and vnderſtanding. And I, like vnto an euill, wicked, and diſobedient child, haue giuen my will, power, and ſenſes to the contrarie: making almoſt of euerie earthlie and carnall thing a god.
                        Furthermore, the bloud of Chriſt was not reputed by me, ſufficient for to waſh me from the filth of my ſinnes; neither ſuch waies as he had appointed by his word: but I ſought for ſuch riffraffe, as the Biſhop of Rome hath planted in his tyrannie and kingdome, truſting with great confidence, by the vertue and holineſſe of them, to receiue full remiſſion of my ſinnes. And ſo I did, as much as was in me, obfuſcate and darken the great benefit of Chriſtes paſſion; than the which no thought can conceiue anie thing of more value. There cannot be done ſo great an iniurie and diſpleaſure to almightie God our father, as to tread vnder foote Chriſt, his onlie begotten and welbeloued ſonne. All other ſinnes in the world, gathered together in one, be not ſo heinous, and deteſtable in the ſight of God. And no wonder. For in Chriſt crucified, God doth ſhewe himſelfe moſt noble and glorious, euen an almightie God, and moſt louing father, in his onlie deare and choſen bleſſed ſonne.
                        And therefore I count my ſelfe one of the moſt wicked and miſerable ſinners in the world, bicauſe I haue beene ſo much contrarie to Chriſt my ſauiour. Saint Paule deſired to knowe nothing but Chriſt crucified, after he had beene rapt into the third heauen, where he heard ſuch ſecrets as were not conuenient & meete to vtter to men: but counted all his works and doings as nothing, to win Chriſt. And I, moſt preſumptuouſlie thinking nothing of Chriſt crucified, went about

to ſet foorth mine owne righteouſneſſe, ſaieng with the proud Phariſie: Good Lord I thanke thee, I am not like other men; I am none adulterer, nor fornicator: and ſo foorth, with ſuch like words of vaine glorie, extolling my ſelfe, and deſpiſing others, working as an hired ſeruant for wages, or elſe for reward: and not as a louing child, onlie for verie loue, without reſpect of wages or reward, as I ought to haue done. Neither did I conſider, how beneficiall a father I had, who did ſhew me his charitie and mercie of his owne meere grace and goodneſſe, that when I was moſt his enimie, he ſent his onlie begotten and welbeloued ſonne into this world of wretchedneſſe and miſerie, to ſuffer moſt cruell and ſharpe death for my redemption. But my hart was ſo ſtonie and hard, that this great benefit was neuer trulie and liuelie printed in my hart, although with my words it was oft rehearſed, thinking my ſelfe to be ſufficientlie inſtructed in the ſame, and being in deede in blinde ignorance: and yet I ſtoode ſo well in mine owne iudgement and opinion, that I thought it vaine to ſeeke the increaſe of my knowledge therein.
                        Paule calleth Chriſt the wiſdome of God; and euen the ſame Chriſt was to me fooliſhneſſe. My pride and blindneſſe deceiued me, and the hardneſſe of my hart withſtoode the groning of truth within it. Such were the fruits of my carnall and humane reaſons, to haue rotten ignorance in price for ripe & ſeaſonable knowledge: ſuch alſo is the malice and wickedneſſe that poſſeſſeth the harts of men: ſuch is the wiſdome and pleaſing of the fleſh. I profeſſed Chriſt in my baptiſme, when I began to liue: but I ſwarued from him after baptiſme, in continuance of my liuing; euen as the heathen which neuer had begun.
                        Chriſt was innocent and void of all ſinne; and I wallowed in filthie ſinne, and was free from no ſinne.

Chriſt was obedient vnto his father, euen to the death of the croſſe; and I diſobedient and moſt ſtubborne, euen to the confuſion of truth. Chriſt was meeke and humble in hart, and I moſt proud and vaine-glorious. Chriſt deſpiſed the world, with all the vanities therof; and I make it my God, becauſe of the vanities. Chriſt came to ſerue his brethren; and I coueted to rule ouer them. Chriſt deſpiſed worldlie honour; and I much delighted to attaine the ſame. Chriſt loued the baſe and ſimple things of the world; and I eſteemed the moſt faire and pleaſant things. Chriſt loued pouertie; and I wealth. Chriſt was gentle and mercifull to the poore; and I hard-harted and vngentle. Chriſt praied for his enimies; and I hated mine. Chriſt reioiced in the conuerſion of ſinners; and I was not greeued to ſee their reuerſion to ſinne. By this declaration, all creatures may perceiue, how far I was from Chriſt, and without Chriſt; yea how contrarie to Chriſt, although I bare the name of a Chriſtian. Inſomuch that if anie man had ſaid I had beene without Chriſt, I would haue ſtiffelie denied and withſtoode the ſame: and yet in deede I neither knew Chriſt, nor wherefore he came.
                        As concerning the effect and purpoſe of his comming, I had a certaine vaine and blind knowledge, both cold and dead, which may be had with all ſinne: as doth plainelie appeare by this my confeſſion and open declaration.
                     
                     
                        The ſecond Chapter, A lamentation of a ſinner, with hartie repentance in faith to obtaine abſolution and remiſſion, through the merits of Christ.
                        
                           WHat cauſe now haue I to lament, ſigh, and weepe for my life & time ſo euill ſpent? With how much humilitie and lowlineſſe ought I to come and knowledge my ſinnes to God,

giuing him thanks, that it hath pleaſed him of his aboundant goodneſſe, to giue me time of repentance. For I knowe my ſinnes in the conſideration of them, to be ſo greeuous, and in the number ſo exceeding, that I haue deſerued verie often eternall damnation. And for the deferring of Gods wrath, ſo manifoldlie due, I muſt vnceſſantlie giue thanks to the mercie of God: beſeeching alſo, that the ſame delaie of puniſhment cauſe not his plague to be the ſorer, ſince mine owne conſcience condemneth my former doings. But his mercie exceedeth all iniquitie. And if I ſhould not thus hope, alas, what ſhould I ſeeke for refuge and comfort? No mortall man is of power to help me; and for the multitude of my ſinnes, I dare not lift vp mine eies to heauen, where the ſeate of iudgement is, I haue ſo much offended my God. What? Shall I fall in deſperation? Naie, I will call vpon Chriſt the light of the world, the fountaine of life, the reliefe of all carefull conſciences, the peacemaker betweene God and man, and the onlie health and comfort of all true repentant ſinners.
                        He can by his almightie power ſaue me, and deliuer me out of this miſerable ſtate, and hath will by his mercie to ſaue euen the whole ſin of the world. I haue no hope nor confidence in anie creature, neither in heauen nor earth; but in Chriſt my whole & onlie Sauiour. He came into the world to ſaue ſinners, and to heale them that are ſicke. For he ſaid, The whole haue no neede of the phyſician. Behold Lord, how I come to thee, a ſinner ſicke, and grieuouſlie wounded: I aſke not bread; but the crums that fall from the childrens table. Caſt me not out of thy ſight, although I haue deſerued to be caſt into hell fire.
                        If I ſhould looke vpon my ſinne, and not vpon thy mercie, I ſhould deſpaire. For in my ſelfe I find nothing to ſaue me, but a dunghill of wickedneſſe to condemne

me. If I ſhould hope by mine owne ſtrength and power to come out of this maze of iniquitie and wickedneſſe, wherein I haue walked ſo long, I ſhould be deceiued. For I am ſo ignorant, blind, weake, and feeble; that I can not bring my ſelfe out of this intangled and wayward maze: but the more I ſeeke means & waies to winde my ſelfe out, the more I am wrapped and tangled therein.
                        So that I perceiue my ſtriuing therein to be hinderance, my trauell to be labour ſpent in going backe. It is the hand of the Lord that can and will bring me out of the endleſſe maze of death. For without I be preuented by the grace of the Lord, I can not aſke forgiueneſſe, nor be repentant or ſorie for them. There is no man can auow, that Chriſt is the onlie Sauiour of the world, but by the holie Ghoſt: yea, as S. Paule ſaith, no man can ſaie, The Lord Ieſus, but by the holie Ghoſt. The ſpirit helpeth our infirmitie, and maketh continuall interceſſion for vs, with ſuch ſorowfull gronings as can not be expreſſed.
                        Therefore I will firſt require and praie the Lord, to giue me his holie ſpirit, to teach me to auow that Chriſt is the Sauiour of the world, and to vtter theſe words, The Lord Ieſus, and finallie to helpe mine infirmities, and to intercede or intreate for me. For I am moſt certaine and ſure, that no creature in heauen nor earth, is of power, or can by anie meane helpe me: but God, who is omnipotent, almightie, beneficiall, and mercifull, welwilling, and louing to all thoſe that call and put their whole confidence and truſt in him. And therefore I will ſeeke none other meanes nor aduocate, but Chriſtes holie ſpirit, who is onlie the aduocate and mediatour betweene GOD and man, to helpe and releeue mee.
                     
                     
                        
                        The third Chapter, VVhat true faith worketh in the ſoule of a ſinner.
                        
                        
                           BUt now, what maketh me ſo bold and hardie to preſume to come to the Lord with ſuch audacitie and boldneſſe, being ſo great a ſinner? Trulie nothing but his owne word. For he ſaith, Come to me all ye that labour, and are burdened, and I ſhall refreſh you. What gentle, mercifull, and comfortable words are theſe to all ſinners? Were he not a frantike, madde, beaſtlie, and fooliſh man, that would runne for aide, helpe, or refuge to anie other creature? What a moſt gratious, comfortable, and gentle ſaieng was this, with ſuch pleaſant and ſweete words to allure his verie enimies to come vnto him? Is there anie worldlie Prince or Magiſtrate, that would ſhew ſuch clemencie, and mercie, to their diſobedient & rebellious ſubiects, hauing offended them? I ſuppoſe they would not with ſuch words allure them, except it were to call them, whome they cannot take, and puniſh them being taken. But euen as Chriſt is Prince of princes, and Lord of lords: ſo his charitie and mercie exceedeth and ſurmounteth all others. Chriſt ſaith, If carnall fathers do giue good gifts to their children, when they aſke them, how much more ſhall your heauenlie father, being in ſubſtance all holie, and moſt highlie good, giue good gifts to all them that aſke him?
                        It is no ſmall nor little gift that I now require, neither thinke I my ſelfe worthie to receiue ſuch a noble gift, being ſo ingrate, vnkind, and wicked a child. But when I behold the benignitie, liberalitie, mercie, and goodneſſe of the Lord, I am encouraged, boldened, and ſtirred to aſke ſuch a noble gift. The Lord is ſo bountifull and liberall, that he will not haue vs ſatiſfied

and contented with one gift; neither to aſke ſimple and ſmall gifts: and therefore he promiſeth, and bindeth himſelfe by his word, to giue good and beneficiall gifts to all them that aſke him with true faith, without which nothing can be done acceptable or pleaſing to God. For faith is the foundation & ground of all other gifts, vertues, and graces: and therefore I will praie and ſaie: Lord increaſe my faith.
                        For this is the life euerlaſting, Lord, that I muſt beleeue thee to be the true God, and whom thou didſt ſend Ieſus Chriſt. By this faith I am aſſured, and by this aſſurance I feele the remiſſion of my ſins. This is it that maketh me bold, this is it that comforteth me; this is it that quencheth all deſpaire.
                        I knowe O my Lord, thine eies looke vpon my faith. S. Paule ſaith, We be iuſtified by faith in Chriſt, and not by the deeds of the lawe. For if righteouſnes come by the lawe, then Chriſt died in vaine. S. Paule meaneth not here, a dead, humane, and hiſtoricall faith, gotten by humane induſtrie: but a ſupernall, and liuelie faith, which worketh by charitie; as he himſelfe plainlie expreſſeth. This dignitie of faith is no derogation to good works. For out of this faith ſpring all good works: yet we may not impute to the woorthineſſe of faith or works, our iuſtification before God: but aſcribe and giue the woorthineſſe of it, wholie to the merits of Chriſts paſſion, and refer and attribute the knowledge and perceiuing thereof, onlie to faith: whoſe verie, true, and onlie propertie it is, to take, apprehend, and hold faſt the promiſes of Gods mercie, the which maketh vs righteous: and to cauſe me continuallie to hope for the ſame mercie, and in loue to worke all maner of waies allowed in the Scripture, that I may be thankfull for the ſame.
                        Thus I feele my ſelfe to come (as it were) in a new garment before God; and now by his mercie, to be taken

iuſt and righteous, which of late without his mercie was ſinfull and wicked: and by faith to obteine his mercie, the which the vnfaithfull can not enioie. And although S. Iohn extolleth charitie in his Epiſtle, ſaieng that God is charitie, and he that dwelleth in charitie, dwelleth in God. Truelie charitie maketh men liue like Angels; and of the moſt furious, vnbrideled, and carnall men, maketh meeke lambes.
                        Yea, with how feruent a ſpirit ought I to call, crie, and praie to the Lord, to make his great charitie to burne and flame my hart, being ſtonie and euill affected, that it neuer would conceiue nor regard the great ineſtimable charitie and loue of God, in ſending his onlie begotten and deere beloued ſonne into this vale of miſerie, to ſuffer the moſt cruell and ſharpe death of the croſſe for my redemption? Yea I neuer had this vnſpeakeable, and moſt high charitie, and abundant loue of God printed and fixed in my hart duelie, till it pleaſed God, of his meere grace, mercie, and pittie, to open mine eies, making me to ſee and behold with the eie of liuelie faith, Chriſt crucified, to be mine onelie Sauiour and redeemer. For then I began (and not before) to perceiue and ſee mine owne ignorance and blindneſſe: the cauſe thereof was, that I would not learne to knowe Chriſt my Sauiour and redeemer.
                        But when God, of his meere goodneſſe, had thus opened mine eies, and made me ſee and behold Chriſt, the wiſedome of God, the light of the world, with a ſupernaturall ſight of faith; all pleaſures, vanities, honor, riches, wealth, and aids of the world, began to waxe bitter vnto me. Then I knew it was no illuſion of the diuell, nor falſe, ne humane doctrine I had receiued. When ſuch ſucceſſe came thereof, that I had in deteſtation and horrour that which I erſt ſo much loued and eſteemed: being of God forbidden that we ſhould loue the world, or the vaine pleaſures and ſhadowes

in the ſame: then began I to perceiue that Chriſt was my onlie Sauior and redeemer; and the ſame doctrine to be all diuine, holie, heauenlie, and infuſed by grace into the harts of the faithfull, which neuer can be attained by hnmane doctrine, wit, nor reaſon, although they ſhould trauell and labour for the ſame, to the end of the world. Then began I to dwell in God by charitie, knowing by the louing charitie of God, in the remiſſion of my ſinnes, that God is charitie, as S. Iohn ſaith. So that of my faith (whereby I came to knowe God, and whereby it pleaſed God, euen bicauſe I truſted in him, to iuſtifie me) ſprang this excellent charitie in my hart.
                        I thinke no leſſe, but manie will woonder and maruell at this my ſaieng, that I neuer knewe Chriſt for my Sauiour and redeemer, vntill this time. For many haue this opinion, ſaieng: Who knoweth not there is a Chriſt? Who being a Chriſtian doth not confeſſe him his Sauiour? And thus, beleeuing their dead, humane, hiſtoricall faith and knowledge (which they haue learned in their ſcholaſticall bookes) to be the true infuſed faith and knowledge of Chriſt, which may be had (as I ſaid before) with all ſinne, they vſe to ſaie, by their owne experience of themſelues, that their faith doth not iuſtifie them. And true it is, except they haue this faith, the which I haue declared here before, they ſhall neuer be iuſtified.
                        And yet it is not falſe, that by faith onlie I am ſure to be iuſtified. Euen this is the cauſe that ſo manie impugne this office and dutie of true faith, bicauſe ſo manie lacke the true faith. And euen as the faithfull are forced to allow this true faith; ſo the vnfaithfull can in no wiſe probablie intreate thereof: the one feeling in himſelfe that he ſaith, the other hauing not in him for to ſaie.
                        I haue certeinlie no curious learning to defend this

matter withall, but a ſimple zeale, and earneſt loue to the truth inſpired of God, who promiſeth to powre his ſpirit vpon all fleſh, which I haue by the grace of God whom I moſt humblie honour) felt in my ſelfe to be true.
                     
                     
                        The fourth Chapter, Of the great loue of God towards mankind, and of the inward beholding of Chriſt crucified.
                        
                        
                           LEt vs therfore now, I praie you, by faith behold and conſider the great charitie & goodneſſe of God, in ſending his ſonne to ſuffer death for our redemption, when we were his mortall enimies, and after what ſort and maner he ſent him.
                        Firſt it is to be conſidered, yea to be vndoubtedlie, and with a perfect faith beleeued, that God ſent him to vs freelie. For he did giue him, and ſold him not. A more noble and rich gift he could not haue giuen. He ſent not a ſeruant or a friend, but his onlie ſonne ſo deerelie beloued: not in delights, riches, and honours; but in croſſes, pouerties, and ſlanders: not as a Lord, but as a ſeruant, yea and in moſt vile and painefull paſſions, to waſh vs: not with water, but with his owne pretious bloud: not from mire, but from the puddle and filth of our iniquities. He hath giuen him, not to make vs poore; but to enrich vs with his diuine vertues, merits, and graces: yea, and in him he hath giuen vs all good things, and finallie himſelfe; and with ſuch great charitie, as can not be expreſſed.
                        Was it not a moſt high and abundant charitie of God, to ſend Chriſt to ſhed his bloud, to looſe honour, life, and all, for his enimies? Euen in the time, when he had done him moſt iniurie, he firſt ſhewed his charitie to vs, with ſuch flames of loue, that greater could not be ſhewed. God in Chriſt hath opened vnto vs, (although

we be weake and blind of our ſelues) that we may behold in this miſerable eſtate, the great wiſedome, goodneſſe, and truth, with all the other godlie perfections, which be in Chriſt. Therefore inwardlie to behold Chriſt crucified vpon the croſſe, is the beſt and godlieſt meditation that can be.
                        We may ſee alſo in Chriſt crucified, the beautie of the ſoule, better than in all the bookes of the world. For who that with a liuelie faith, ſeeth and feeleth in ſpirit, that Chriſt the ſonne of God is dead for the ſatiſfieng and purifieng of the ſoule, ſhall ſee, that his ſoule is appointed for the verie tabernacle and manſion of the ineſtimable and incomprehenſible maieſtie and honour of God. We ſee alſo in Chriſt crucified, how vaine and fooliſh the world is, and how that Chriſt being moſt wiſe deſpiſed the ſame. We ſee alſo how blind it is, becauſe the ſame knoweth not Chriſt, but perſecuteth him. We ſee alſo how vnkind the world is, by the killing of Chriſt, in the time he did ſhew it moſt fauour. How hard, and obſtinate was it, that would not be mollified with ſo manie teares, ſuch ſweate, and ſo much bloudſhead of the ſonne of God, ſuffering with ſo great and high charitie?
                        Therefore he is now verie blind, that ſeeth not how vaine, fooliſh, falſe, ingrate, cruell, hard, wicked, and euill the world is. We may alſo in Chriſt crucified weigh our ſinnes, as in a diuine ballance, how greeuous and how weightie they be, ſeeing they haue crucified Chriſt. For they would neuer haue beene counterpaiſed, but with the great and pretious weight of the bloud of the ſonne of God. And therefore God, of his high goodneſſe, determined that his bleſſed ſonne ſhould rather ſuffer bloudſhead, thau our ſinnes ſhould haue condemned vs. We ſhall neuer knowe our owne miſerie and wretchedneſſe, but with the light of Chriſt crucified: Then we ſhall ſee our owne crueltie, when

we feele his mercie; our owne vnrighteouſneſſe and iniquitie, when we ſee his righteouſnes and holineſſe. Therefore, to learne to knowe trulie our owne ſinnes, is to ſtudie in the booke of the Crucifixe, by continuall conuerſation in faith: and to haue perfect and plentifull charitie, is to learne firſt by faith the charitie that is in God towards vs.
                        We may ſee alſo in Chriſt vpon the Croſſe, how great the paines of hell, and how bleſſed the ioies of heauen be: and what a ſharpe and painefull thing it ſhall be to them, that of that ſweet, happie, and glorious ioie Chriſt ſhall be depriued. Then this Crucifixe is the booke, wherein God hath included all things, and hath moſt compendiouſlie written therein all truth, profitable and neceſſarie for our ſaluation. Therefore let vs endeuour our ſelues to ſtudie this booke, that we being lightened with the ſpirit of God, may giue him thanks for ſo great a benefit.
                     
                     
                        The fift Chapter, Of the glorious victories of Chriſt ouer all enimies.
                        
                        
                           IF we looke further in this booke, we ſhall ſee Chriſts great victorie vpon the croſſe, which was ſo noble and mightie, that there neuer was, neither ſhall be ſuch. If the victorie and glorie of worldlie Princes were great, becauſe they did ouercome great hoſtes of men: how much was Chriſtes greater, which vanquiſhed not onelie the Prince of this world, but all the enimies of God; triumphing ouer perſecution, iniuries, villanies, ſlanders, yea death, the world, ſinne, and the diuell; and brought to confuſion all carnall prudence?
                        The Princes of the world neuer did fight without the ſtrength of the world: Chriſt contrarilie went to warre, euen againſt all the ſtrength of the world. He

fought, as Dauid did with Golias, vnarmed of all humane wiſdome and policie, and without all worldlie power and ſtrength. Neuertheleſſe, he was fullie repleniſhed and armed with the whole armour of the ſpirit. And in this one battell, he ouercame for euer all his enimies. There was neuer ſo glorious a ſpoile, neither a more rich and noble, than Chriſt was vpon the Croſſe, which deliuered all his elect from ſuch a ſharpe and miſerable captiuitie. He had in his battell manie ſtripes, yea and loſt his life, but his victorie was ſo much the greater. Therfore, when I looke vpon the ſonne of God with a ſupernaturall faith and light, ſo vnarmed, naked, giuen vp, and alone with humilitie, patience, liberalitie, modeſtie, gentleneſſe, and with all other his diuine vertues beating downe to the ground all Gods enimies, and making the ſoule of man ſo faire and beautifull: I am forced to ſaie, that his victorie and triumph was maruellous. And therefore Chriſt well deſerued to haue this noble title: IESVS OF NAZARETH, KING OF THE IEWES.
                        
                        But if we will particularlie vnfold and ſee his great victories, let vs firſt behold how he ouercame ſinne, with his innocencie; & confounded pride, with his humilitie; quenched all worldlie loue, with his charitie; appeaſed the wrath of his father, with his meekeneſſe; and turned hatred into loue, with his ſo manie benefits and godlie zeale.
                        Chriſt hath not onlie ouercome ſinne, but rather he hath killed the ſame; in aſmuch as he hath ſatiſfied for it himſelfe, with the moſt holie ſacrifice and oblation of his pretious bodie, in ſuffering moſt bitter and cruell death. Alſo, after another ſort, that is, he giueth all thoſe that loue him, ſo much ſpirit, grace, vertue, and ſtrength, that they may reſiſt, impugne, and ouercome ſinne; and not conſent; neither ſuffer it to reigne in them. He hath alſo vanquiſhed ſinne, becauſe he hath

taken awaie the force of the ſame; that is, he hath cancelled the lawe, which was in euill men the occaſion of ſinne. Therefore ſinne hath no power againſt them that are with the holie Ghoſt vnited to Chriſt: in them there is nothing worthie of damnation. And although the dregs of Adam do remaine, that is, our concupiſcences, which in deede be ſinnes: neuertheleſſe, they be not imputed for ſinnes, if we be trulie planted in Chriſt. It is true, that Chriſt might haue taken awaie all our immoderate affections: but hee hath left them for the great glorie of his father, and for his owne greater triumph. As for example. When a Prince fighteth with his enimies, which ſometime had the ſouereigntie ouer his people, and ſubduing them, may kill them if he will: yet he preſerueth and ſaueth them: and whereas they were Lords ouer his people, he maketh them after to ſerue, whome they before had ruled. Now in ſuch a caſe, the Prince doth ſhew himſelfe a greater conquerour, in that he hath made them, which were rulers, to obeie: and the ſubiects to be Lords ouer them, to whome they ſerued, than if he had vtterlie deſtroied them vpon the conqueſt. For now he leaueth continuall victorie to them whome he redeemed, whereas otherwiſe the occaſion of victorie was taken awaie, where none were left to be the ſubiects. Euen ſo in like caſe, Chriſt hath left in vs theſe concupiſcences, to the intent they ſhould ſerue vs, to the exerciſe of our vertues; where firſt they did reigne ouer vs, to the exerciſe of our ſinne. And it may be plainelie ſeene, that whereas firſt they were ſuch impediments to vs, that we could not moue our ſelues towards God: now by Chriſt we haue ſo much ſtrength, that notwithſtanding the force of them, we may aſſuredlie walke to heauen. And although the children of God ſometime do fall by fariltie into ſome ſinne: yet that falling maketh them to humble themſelues,

and to reknowledge the goodneſſe of God, and to come to him for refuge and helpe.
                        Likewiſe Chriſt, by his death, hath ouercome the Prince of diuels with all his hoaſt, and hath deſtroied them all. For as Paule ſaith, it is verified, that Chriſt ſhould breake the Serpents head, propheſied by God. And although the diuell tempt vs, yet if by faith we be planted in Chriſt, we ſhall not periſh, but rather by his temptation take great force and might. So it is euident, that the triumph, victorie, and glorie of Chriſt is the greater, hauing in ſuch ſort ſubdued the diuell; that whereas he was Prince and Lord of the world, holding all creatures in captiuitie: now Chriſt vſeth him as an inſtrument to puniſh the wicked, and to exerciſe and make ſtrong the elect of God in Chriſtian warfare.
                        Chriſt likewiſe hath ouercome death in a more glorious manner (if it be poſſible:) becauſe he hath not taken it awaie, but leauing vniuerſallie all ſubiect to the ſame. He hath giuen ſo much vertue and ſpirit, that whereas afore we paſſed thereto with great feare, now we be bold through the ſpirit, for the ſure hope of the reſurrection, that we receiue it with ioie. It is now no more bitter, but ſweete: no more feared, but deſired: it is no death, but life.
                        And alſo it hath pleaſed God, that the infirmities and aduerſities do remaine to the ſight of the world: but the children of God are by Chriſt made ſo ſtrong, righteous, whole, and ſound, that the troubles of the world, be comforts of the ſpirit: the paſſions of the fleſh, are medicines of the ſoule. For all maner things worke to their commoditie and profite. For they in ſpirit feele, that God their father doth gouerne them, and diſpoſeth all things for their benefit: therefore they feele themſelues ſure. In perſecution they are quiet and peacefull, in trouble they are without weerineſſe,

feares, anxieties, ſuſpicions, miſeries: and finallie all the good and euill of the world worketh to their commoditie.
                        Moreouer, they ſee that the triumph of Chriſt hath beene ſo great, that not onelie he hath ſubdued and vanquiſhed all our enimies, and the power of them; but he hath ouerthrowne and vanquiſhed them after ſuch a ſort, that all things ſerue to our helth. He might and could haue taken them all awaie, but where then ſhould haue beene our victorie, palme, and crowne? For we dailie haue fights in the fleſh, and by the ſuccour of grace haue continuall victories ouer ſinne: whereby we haue cauſe to glorifie God, that by his ſonne hath weakened our enimie the diuell, and by his ſpirit giueth vs ſtrength to vanquiſh his ofſpring.
                        So doo we knowledge dailie the great triumph of our Sauiour, & reioice in our owne fights; the which we can no wiſe impute to anie wiſdome of this world; ſeeing ſinne to increaſe by it. And where worldlie wiſedome moſt gouerneth, there moſt ſinne ruleth. For as the world is enimie to God, ſo alſo the wiſdome therof is aduerſe to God: and therefore Chriſt hath declared & diſcouered the ſame for fooliſhneſſe. And although he could haue taken awaie all worldlie wiſedome: yet he hath left it for his greater glorie, and triumph of his choſen veſſels. For before, whereas it was our ruler againſt God: now by Chriſt we are ſerued of it for God, as of a ſlaue in worldlie things: albeit in ſupernaturall things the ſame is not to be vnderſtood. And further, if at anie time men would impugne, and gainſaie vs, with the wiſedome of the world: yet we haue by Chriſt ſo much ſupernaturall light of the truth, that we make a mocke of all thoſe that repugne the truth.
                        Chriſt alſo vpon the croſſe hath triumphed ouer the world. Firſt, bicauſe he hath diſcouered the ſame to be

naught: that whereas it was couered with the vaile of hypocriſie, and the veſture of morall vertues; Chriſt hath ſhewed, that in Gods ſight the righteouſneſſe of the world is wickedneſſe: and he hath yeelded witnes, that The works of men, not regenerated by him in faith, are euill: and ſo Chriſt hath iudged and condemned the world for naught. Further more, he hath giuen to all his ſo much light and ſpirit, that they knowe it, and diſpraiſe the ſame: yea and tread it vnder their feet, with all vaine honours, dignities, & pleaſures, not taking the faire promiſes, neither the offers which it doth preſent: naie, they rather make a ſcorne of them. And as for the threatnings and force of the world, they nothing feare.
                        Now therefore we may ſee how great the victorie and triumph of Chriſt is, who hath deliuered all thoſe the father gaue him, from the power of the diuell, cancelling vpon the croſſe the writing of our debts. For he hath deliuered vs from the condemnation of ſinne; from the bondage of the lawe, from the feare of death, from the danger of the world, and from all euils in this life, and in the other to come. And he hath inriched vs, made vs noble, and moſt highlie happie, after ſuch a glorious and triumphant waie, as can not with tongue be expreſſed: and therefore we are forced to ſaie, his triumph is maruellous.
                        It is alſo ſeene and knowne, that Chriſt is the true Meſſias. For he hath deliuered man from all euils, and by him man hath all goodneſſe: ſo that he is the true Meſſias. Therefore all other helpers be but vaine, and counterfeited ſauiours; ſeeing that by this our Meſſias Chriſt, wholie and onlie we be deliuered from all euils, and by him we haue all goodneſſe. And that this is true, it is euident and cleare; bicauſe the verie true Chriſtian, is a Chriſtian by Chriſt. And the true Chriſtian feeleth inwardlie by Chriſt, ſo much

goodneſſe of God, that euen troublous life and death be ſweet vnto him, and miſeries happie. The true Chriſtian by Chriſt is diſburdened from the ſeruitude of the lawe, hauing the lawe of grace (grauen by the ſpirit) inhabiting his hart, and from ſinne that reigned in him, from the power of the infernall ſpirits, from damnation, and from euerie euill: and is made a ſonne of God, a brother of Chriſt, heire of heauen, and Lord of the world: ſo that in Chriſt and by Chriſt, he poſſeſſeth all good things.
                        But let vs knowe, that Chriſt yet fighteth in ſpirit in his elect veſſels, and ſhall fight euen to the daie of iudgment: at which day ſhall that great enimie death be wholie deſtroied, and ſhall be no more. Then ſhall the children of God reioice on him, ſaieng: O death where is thy victorie and ſting? There ſhall be then no more trouble nor ſinne; naie rather, none euill: but heauen for the good, and hell for the wicked. Then ſhall wholie be diſcouered the victorie & triumph of Chriſt, who (after Paule) ſhall preſent vnto his father the kingdome, together with his choſen ſaued by him.
                        It was no little fauour towards his children, that Chriſt was choſen of God, to ſaue vs his elect, ſo highlie by the waie of the croſſe. Paule calleth it a grace, and a moſt ſingular grace. We may well thinke, that he hauing beene to the world ſo valiant a captaine of God, was full of light, grace, vertue, and ſpirit: therefore he might iuſtlie ſaie: Conſummatum eſt. Wee ſeeing then, that the triumph and victorie of our captaine Chriſt, is ſo maruellous, glorious, and noble, to the which war we be appointed: let vs force our ſelues to folowe him, with bearing our croſſe, that we may haue felowſhip with him in his kingdome.
                     
                     
                        
                        The ſixt Chapter, That we ought to ſubmit our ſelues to the ſchoole of the Croſſe: and ſtill looke and learne in the booke of the Crucifix.
                        
                        
                           TRulie it may be moſt iuſtlie verified, that to behold Chriſt crucified, in ſpirit, is the beſt meditation that can be. I certeinlie neuer knew mine owne miſeries and wretchednes ſo well by booke, admonition, or learning; as I haue done by looking into the ſpirituall booke of the Crucifix. I lament much I haue paſſed ſo manie yeeres, not regarding that diuine booke: but I iudged, & thought my ſelfe to be well inſtructed in the ſame: wheras now I am of this opinion, that if God would ſuffer me to liue here a thouſand yeeres, and ſhould ſtudie continuallie in the ſame diuine booke, I ſhould not be filled with the contemplation thereof. Neither hold I my ſelfe contented, but alwaies haue a great deſire, to learne and ſtudie more therein. I neuer knewe mine owne wickednes, neither lamented for my ſinnes trulie, vntill the time God inſpired me with his grace, that I looked in this booke: then I began to ſee perfectlie, that mine owne power and ſtrength could not helpe me; and that I was in the Lords hand, euen as the claie is in the potters hand; then I began to crie and ſaie:
                        Alas Lord that euer I haue ſo wickedlie offended thee, being to me from the beginning ſo gratious and ſo good a father, and moſt ſpeciallie now haſt declared and ſhewed thy goodneſſe vnto me, when in the time I haue done thee moſt iniurie, to call me, and alſo to make me knowe & take thee for my Sauior and redeemer. Such be the wonderfull works of God to call ſinners to repentance, & to make them to take Chriſt his welbeloued ſonne for their Sauior: this is the gift of God, & of all Chriſtians to be required and deſired. For

except this great benefit of Chriſt crucified be felt and fixed ſurelie in mans hart, there can be no good worke done acceptable before God. For in Chriſt is all fulneſſe of the Godhead, and in him are hid all the treaſures of wiſdome and knowledge. Euen he is the water of life, whereof whoſoeuer ſhall drinke, he ſhall neuer more thirſt; but it ſhall be in him a well of water, ſpringing vp into euerlaſting life. S. Paule ſaith, There is no damnation to them that are in Chriſt, which walke not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit. Moreouer he ſaith: If when we were enimies, we were reconciled to God, by the death of his ſon: much more, ſeeing we are reconciled, we ſhall be preſerued by his death. It is no little or ſmall benefit we haue receiued by Chriſt, if we conſider what he hath done for vs, as I haue perfectlie declared heretofore. Wherefore I praie the Lord, that this great benefit of Chriſt crucified, may be ſtedfaſtlie fixed & printed in all Chriſtians harts, that they may be true louers of God, and worke as children for loue: and not as ſeruants, compelled with threatenings, or prouoked with hire.
                        The ſincere and pure louers of God doo embrace Chriſt, with ſuch feruencie of ſpirit, that they reioice in hope, be bold in danger, ſuffer in aduerſitie, continue in praier, bleſſe their perſecutors. Further, they be not wiſe in their owne opinion, neither high minded in their proſperitie, neither abaſhed in their aduerſitie: but humble and gentle alwaies to all men. For they knowe by their faith they are members all of one bodie, and that they haue poſſeſſed all one God, one faith, one baptiſme, one ioie, and one ſaluation. If theſe pure and ſincere louers of God were thicke ſowne, there ſhould not be ſo much contention and ſtrife growing on the fields of our religion, as there is. Well, I ſhall praie to the Lord to take all contention and ſtrife awaie, and that the ſowers of ſedition may haue mind

to ceaſe their labour, or to ſowe it among the ſtones, and to haue grace to ſowe gratious vertues, where they may both take roote, and bring foorth fruit, with ſending alſo a godlie vnitie and concord amongſt all Chriſtians, that we may ſerue the Lord in true holineſſe of life.
                     
                     
                        The ſeuenth Chapter, A Christian bewailing of the miſerable ignorance and blindneſſe of men.
                        
                        
                           THe example of good liuing is required of all Chriſtians, but ſpeciallie in the Eccleſiaſticall paſtors and ſhepheards. For they be called in ſcripture, Workemen with God, Diſburſers of Gods ſecrets, The light of the world, The ſalt of the earth: at whoſe hands all other ſhould take comfort in working, knowledge of Gods will, and ſight to become children of light, and taſte of ſeaſonable wiſdome. They haue, or ſhould haue the holie ſpirit, abundantlie to pronounce and ſet foorth the word of God, in veritie and truth. If ignorance and blindneſſe reigne amongſt vs, they ſhould with the truth of Gods word inſtruct and ſet vs in the truth, and direct vs in the waie of the Lord.
                        But thanks be giuen vnto the Lord, that hath now ſent vs ſuch a godlie and learned King, in theſe latter daies to reigne ouer vs, that with the vertue & force of Gods word, hath taken awaie the vailes and miſts of errours, and brought vs to the knowledge of the truth, by the light of Gods word; which was ſo long hid, and kept vnder, that the people were nigh famiſhed, and hungred for lacke of ſpirituall food. (Such was the charitie of the ſpirituall curats and ſhepheards.) But our Moſes, and moſt godlie wiſe Gouernour and King, hath deliuered vs out of the captiuitie and bondage of Pharao. I meane by this Moſes King Henrie,

the eight, my moſt ſouereigne fauourable Lord and huſband; one (if Moſes had figured anie mo than Chriſt) through the excellent grace of God, meete to be an other expreſſed veritie of Moſes conqueſt ouer Pharao. And I meane by this Pharao the biſhop of Rome, who hath beene, and is a greater perſecutor of all true Chriſtians, than euer was Pharao of the children of Iſrael. For he is a perſecutor of the Goſpell and grace, a ſetter foorth of all ſuperſtition and counterfeit holineſſe, bringing manie ſoules to hell with his alchimie and counterfeit monie, deceiuing the poore ſoules vnder the pretence of holineſſe: but ſo much the greater ſhall be his damnation, bicauſe he deceiueth and robbeth vnder Chriſts mantell. The Lord keepe and defend all men from his iuglings and ſleits, but ſpeciallie the poore, ſimple, and vnlearned ſoules. And this leſſon I would all men had of him, that when they begin to miſlike his dooing, then onlie begin they to like God, and certeinlie not before.
                        As for the ſpirituall paſtors and ſhepherds, I thinke they will cleaue and ſticke to the word of God, euen to the death; to vanquiſh all Gods enimies, if neede ſhall require: all reſpects of honour, dignitie, riches, welth, and their priuate commodities laid apart: following alſo the examples of Chriſt, and his choſen Apoſtles, in preaching and teaching ſincere and holeſome doctrine, and ſuch things as make for peace, with godly leſſons, wherewith they may edifie others: that euerie man may walke after his vocation, in holineſſe of life; in vnitie and concord: which vnitie is to be deſired of all true Chriſtians.
                        It is much to be lamented, the ſchiſmes, varieties, contentions and diſputations that haue beene and are in the world, about Chriſtian religion, & no agreement nor concord of the ſame among the learned men. Trulie, the diuell hath beene the ſower of the ſeede of

ſedition, and ſhall be the mainteiner of it, euen till Gods will be fulfilled. There is no war ſo cruell and euill as this. For the war with ſword killeth but the bodies, and this ſlaieth manie ſoules. For the poore vnlearned perſons remaine confuſed, and almoſt euerie one beleeueth and worketh after his owne waie: and yet there is but one truth of Gods word, by the which we ſhall be ſaued. Happie be they that receiue it, and moſt vnhappie are they which neglect and perſecute the ſame. For it ſhall be more eaſie for Sodom and Gomor at the daie of iudgement, than for them. And not without iuſt cauſe, if we conſider the beneuolence, goodneſſe, and mercie of God, who hath declared his charitie towards vs, greater, and more ineſtimable, than euer he did to the Hebrues. For they liued vnder ſhadowes and figures, and were bound to the lawe. And Chriſt (we being his greateſt enimies) hath deliuered vs from the bondage of the lawe, and hath fulfilled all that was figured in their lawe, and alſo in their propheſies, ſheading his owne pretious bloud, to make vs the children of his father, and his brethren, and hath made vs free, ſetting vs in a godlie libertie: I meane not licence to ſinne, as manie be glad to interpret the ſame, when as Chriſtian libertie is godlie intreated of.
                        Trulie it is no good ſpirit that moueth men to find fault at euerie thing, and when things may be well taken, to peruert them into an euill ſenſe and meaning. There be in the world manie ſpeakers of holines and good works, but verie rare and ſeldome is declared which be the good and holie works. The works of the ſpirit be neuer almoſt ſpoken of, and therefore verie few knowe what they be. I am able to iuſtifie, the ignorance of the people to be great, not in this matter alone, but in manie other, the which were moſt neceſſarie for Chriſtians to knowe. Becauſe I haue had

iuſt proofe of the ſame, it maketh me thus much to ſaie, with no little ſorowe and greefe in my hart, for ſuch a miſerable ignorance and blindneſſe amongeſt the people.
                        I doubt not but we can ſaie all, Lord, Lord. But I feare, God may ſaie vnto vs; This people honoureth me with their lips, but their harts be far from me. God deſireth nothing but the hart, and ſaith, He will be worſhipped in ſpirit and truth. Chriſt condemned all hypocriſie and feigned holines, and taught ſincere, pure, and true godlineſſe: but we worſſe than frantike or blinde, will not followe Chriſts doctrine, but truſt to mens doctrines, iudgements, and ſaiengs, which dimmeth our eies, and ſo the blind leadeth the blind, and both fall into the dich. Trulie, in my ſimple and vnlearned iudgement, no mans doctrine is to be eſteemed or preferred like vnto Chriſts, and the Apoſtles; nor to be taught as a perfect and true doctrine, but euen as it doth accord & agree with the doctrine of the Goſpell.
                        But yet thoſe that be called ſpirituall paſtours (although they be moſt carnall, as it doth verie euidentlie and plainelie appeare by their fruites,) are ſo blinded with the loue of themſelues, and the world, that they extoll mens inuentions and doctrines, before the doctrine of the Goſpell. And when they be not able to mainteine their owne inuentions and doctrines, with anie iot of the ſcripture, then they moſt cruellie perſecute them that be contrarie to the ſame. Be ſuch the louers of Chriſt? Naie, naie: they be the louers of the wicked Mammon, neither regarding God nor his honour. For filthie lucre hath made them almoſt mad, but frantike they be doubtleſſe. Is not this miſerable ſtate of ſpirituall men in the world, much to be lamented of all good Chriſtians? But yet I cannot allowe, neither praiſe all kind of lamentation, but ſuch as may ſtand with Chriſtian charitie.
                     
                     
                        
                        The eight Chapter, Of the fruites and rules of true Christianitie for men to followe.
                        
                        
                           CHaritie ſuffereth long, and is gentle, enuieth not, vpbraideth no man, caſteth frowardlie no faults in mens teeth, but referreth all things to God: being angrie without ſinne, reforming others without ſlanders, carrieng euer a ſtore-houſe of mild words to pearce the ſtonie-harted men. I would all Chriſtians, that like as they haue profeſſed Chriſt, would ſo endeuour themſelues to folowe him in godlie liuing. For we haue not put on Chriſt, to liue anie more to our ſelues, in the vanities, delightes, and pleaſures of the world, and the fleſh, ſuffering the concupiſcence and carnalitie of the fleſh to haue his full ſwinge. For we muſt walke after the ſpirit, and not after the fleſh. For the ſpirit is ſpirituall, and coueteth ſpirituall things: and the fleſh carnall, and deſireth carnall things. The men regenerate by Chriſt, deſpiſe the world, and all the vanities and pleaſures thereof. They be no louers of themſelues. For they feele how euill and infirme they be, not being able to do anie good thing, without the helpe of God, from whome they knowledge all goodneſſe to proceede.
                        They flatter not themſelues, with thinking euerie thing which ſhineth to the world, to be good and holie. For they knowe all externe and outward works, be they neuer ſo glorious and faire to the world, may be done of the euill, as well as of the good. And therefore they haue in verie little eſtimation the outward ſhew of holineſſe, becauſe they be all ſpirituall, caſting vp their eies vpon heauenlie things: neither looking nor regarding the earthlie things, for they be to them vile and abiect. They haue alſo the ſimplicitie of the doue, and the policie of the ſerpent. For by ſimplicitie they

haue a deſire to do good to all men, and to hurt no man, no though they haue occaſion giuen: and by policie they giue not nor miniſter anie iuſt cauſe to anie man, whereby their doctrine might be reproued. They be not alſo as a reede ſhaken with euerie winde: but when they be blaſted with the tempeſts and ſtormes of the world, then remaine they moſt firme, ſtable, and quiet, feeling in ſpirit, that God (as their beſt father) doth ſend and ſuffer all things for their benefit and commoditie. Chriſt is to them a rule, a line, an example of Chriſtian life. They be neuer offended at anie thing, although occaſion be miniſtred vnto them. For like as Chriſt, when Peter would haue withdrawne him from death, anſwered and ſaid, Go backe from me Sathan, for thou offendeſt me: that is, As much as lieth in thee, thou giueſt me occaſion with thy words, to make me withdrawe my ſelfe from death, although I yeelded not thereto. For this thy procurement can not extinguiſh the burning deſire I haue, to ſhed my bloud for my choſen. Euen ſo the perfect men are neuer offended at anie thing. For although the world were full of ſinne, they would not withdrawe themſelues from doing of good, nor waxe cold in the loue of the Lord. And much leſſe they would be moued to do euill: yea rather, they be ſo much the more moued to do good.
                        The regenerated by Chriſt are neuer offended at the works of God, becauſe they knowe by faith, that God doth all things well: and that he can not erre, neither for want of power, nor by ignorance, nor malice. For they knowe him to be almightie, and that he ſeeth all things, and is moſt aboundantlie good. They ſee and feele in ſpirit, that of that will moſt highlie perfect, can not but proceede moſt perfecte works. Likewiſe, they be not offended at the works of men. For if they bee good, they are moued by them to take occaſion to

folowe them, and to reknowledge the goodnes of God, with giuing of thanks, and praiſing his name dailie the more. But if they be indifferent, and ſuch as may be done with good and euill intents, they iudge the beſt part, thinking they may bee done to a good purpoſe, and ſo they bee edified. But if they bee ſo euill, that they can not bee taken in good part by anie meanes; yet they bee not offended, although occaſion bee giuen, naie rather they be edified, in aſmuch as they take occaſion to be better, though the contrarie bee miniſtred to them.
                        Then begin they to thinke and ſaie thus: If God had not preſerued me with his grace, I ſhould haue committed this ſin, and worſſe. O how much am I bound to confeſſe and knowledge the goodneſſe of God! They go alſo thinking and ſaieng further: He that hath ſinned, may be one of Gods elect: peraduenture the Lord hath ſuffered him to fall, to the intent he may the better knowe himſelfe. I knowe he is one of them that Chriſt hath ſhed his bloud for, and one of my Chriſtian brethren: trulie I will admoniſh and rebuke him; and in caſe I find him deſperate, I will comfort him, and ſhewe him the great goodneſſe and mercie of God, in Chriſt: and with godlie conſolations I will ſee if I can lift him vp. And thus ye may ſee, how the men regenerated by Chriſt, of euerie thing win and receiue fruit.
                     
                     
                        The ninth Chapter, Of the fruits of infidelitie, and offence of weakelings.
                        
                        
                           AND contrariwiſe, the yonglings and vnperfect are offended at ſmall trifles, taking euerie thing in euill part, grudging and murmuring againſt their neighbor: and ſo much the more, as they ſhew themſelues feruent in their ſo doing, they are iudged of the blind world, and of themſelues great zeale-bearers to God. If this were the

greateſt euill of theſe yonglings, it were not the moſt euill. But I feare they be ſo blind and ignorant, that they are offended alſo at good things, & iudge nothing good, but ſuch as they embrace and eſteeme to bee good, with murmuring againſt all ſuch as folowe not their waies. If there be anie of this ſort, the Lord giue them the light of his truth, that they may increaſe and growe in godlie ſtrength. I ſuppoſe, if ſuch yonglings and vnperfect, had ſeene Chriſt and his Diſciples eate meate with vnwaſhen hands, or not to haue faſted with the Phariſies, they would haue beene offended, ſeeing him a breaker of mens traditions. Their affections diſpoſe their eies to ſee through other men, and they ſee nothing in themſelues: where charitie, although it be moſt ful of eies to ſee the faults of others, whome it coueteth to amend, thinketh none euill, but diſcreetlie and rightlie interpreteth all things, by the which more iuſtlie and trulie euerie thing is taken.
                        Now, theſe ſuperſtitious weaklings, if they had been conuerſant with Chriſt, and ſeene him leade his life ſometime with women, ſometime with Samaritanes, with Publicanes, ſinners, and with the Phariſies, they would haue murmured at him. Alſo, if they had ſeene Marie powre vpon Chriſt the pretious ointment, they would haue ſaid with Iudas: This ointment might haue beene ſold, and giuen to the poore. If they alſo had ſeene Chriſt with whips driue out of the Temple thoſe that bought and ſold, they would foorthwith haue iudged Chriſt to haue beene troubled and moued with anger, and not by zeale of charitie. How would they haue beene offended, if they had ſeene him go to the Iewes feaſt, heale a ſicke man vpon the ſabboth daie, practiſe with the woman of Samaria, yea & ſhew vnto hir of his moſt diuine doctrine & life? They would haue taken occaſion to haue hated & perſecuted him, as the Scribes and Phariſies did: and euen ſo

ſhould Chriſt the Sauiour of the world, haue beene to them an offence and ruine.
                        There be an other kind of little ones vnperfecte, which are offended after this ſort and maner. As when they ſee one that is reputed and eſteemed holie to commit ſinne, forthwith they learne to do that, and woorſe, and waxe cold in dooing of good, and confirme themſelues in euill: and then they excuſe their wicked life, publiſhing the ſame with the ſlander of their neighbor. If anie man reprooue them, they ſaie: Such a man did this, and woorſe. So it is euident, that ſuch perſons would denie Chriſt, if they ſawe other men doe the ſame. If they went to Rome, and ſawe the enormities of the Prelates, which is ſaid to reigne there among them, I doubt not, if they ſawe one of them ſinne, which were reputed and taken for holie, their faith ſhould be loſt; but not the faith of Chriſt, which they neuer poſſeſſed: but they ſhould looſe that humane opinion, which they had of the goodneſſe of the Prelates. For, if they had the faith of Chriſt, the holie Ghoſt ſhould be a witnes vnto them, the which ſhould be mightie in them, that in caſe all the world would denie Chriſt, yet they would remaine firme and ſtable in the true faith.
                        The Phariſies alſo tooke occaſion of the euill of others, to waxe hautie and proud, taking themſelues to be men of greater perfection than anie other; bicauſe of their vertue, euen as the Phariſie did, when he ſawe the Publicans ſubmiſſion. And ſo they be offended with euerie little thing, iudging euill, murmuring againſt their neighbour, and for the ſame, they are of manie reputed and taken for the more holie and good: whereas in deed they be the more wicked. The moſt wicked perſons are offended, euen at themſelues. For at their little ſtabilitie in goodneſſe, and of their delectable and euill life, they take occaſion to deſpaire:

where they ought the more to commit themſelues to God, aſking mercie for their offences: and foorthwith to giue thanks, that it hath pleaſed him of his goodneſſe to ſuffer them ſo long a time.
                        But what needeth it anie more to ſaie? The euill men are offended euen at the works of God, they ſee God ſuffer ſinners, therefore thinke they, ſinne diſpleaſeth him not. And bicauſe they ſee not the good rewarded with riches, oftentimes they imagine, that God loueth them not. It ſeemeth to them God is parciall, bicauſe he hath elected ſome, and ſome reprooued. And therefore they ſaie, that the elected be ſure of ſaluation, taking by that, occaſion to doo euill inough, ſaieng: Whatſoeuer God hath determined, ſhall be performed. If alſo they ſee the good men oppreſſed, and the euill men exalted, they iudge God vniuſt, taking occaſion to liue euillie, ſaieng: Inaſmuch as God fauoureth the naughtie men, let vs doo euill inough, to the intent he doo vs good. If then the wicked be offended euen at God, it is no woonder if they be offended at thoſe that followe and walke in his paths and waies.
                     
                     
                        The tenth Chapter, Of carnall goſpellers, by whoſe euill liuing Gods truth is ſhamefullie ſlandered.
                        
                        
                           IWill now ſpeake with great dolor and heauineſſe in my hart, of a ſort of people, which be in the world, that be called profeſſors of the Goſpell; and by their words doo declare and ſhew, they be much affected to the ſame. But I am afraid, ſome of them doo build vpon the ſand; as Simon Magus did, making a weake foundation: I meane, they make not Chriſt their chiefeſt foundation, profeſſing his doctrine, of a ſincere, pure, and zealous mind; but either for bicauſe they would be called goſpellers,

to procure ſome credit and good opinion of the true and verie fauourers of Chriſts doctrine, either to find out ſome carnall libertie, either to be contentious diſputers, finders or rebukers of other mens faults, or elſe finallie to pleaſe and flatter the world. Such goſpellers are an offence, and a ſlander to the word of God, and make the wicked to reioice & laugh at them, ſaieng: Behold I praie you their faire fruits. What charitie, what diſcretion, what godlineſſe, holineſſe, or puritie of life is among them? Be not they great auengers, foule gluttons, ſlanderers, back biters, adulterers, fornicators, ſwearers, and blaſphemers; yea and wallowe & tumble in all ſinnes? Theſe be the fruits of their doctrine.
                        And thus it may be ſeene, how the word of God is euill ſpoken of, through licentious and euill liuing: and yet the word of God is all holie, pure, ſincere, and godlie, being the doctrine & occaſion of all holie and pure liuing. It is the wicked that peruert all good things, into euill. For an euill tree can not bring foorth good fruit. And when good ſeede is ſowne in a barren and euill ground, it yeeldeth no good corne: and ſo it fareth by the word of God. For when it is heard and knowne of wicked men, it bringeth no good fruit: but when it is ſowne in good ground, I meane the harts of good people, it bringeth foorth good fruit abundantlie: ſo that the want & fault is in men, and not in the word of God. I praie God all men and women may haue grace to become meete tillage for the fruits of the Goſpell, and to leaue onlie the iangling of it. For onlie ſpeaking of the Goſpell maketh not men good Chriſtians, but good talkers, except their facts and works agree with the ſame: ſo then their ſpeech is good, bicauſe their harts be good. And euen as much talke of the word of God, without practiſing the ſame in our liuing, is euill & deteſtable in the ſight of God: ſo it is a lamentable thing

to heare, how there bee manie in the world, that do not well digeſt the reading of ſcripture, and do commend and praiſe ignorance, and ſaie, that much knowledge of Gods word is the originall of all diſſention, ſciſmes, and contention; and maketh men hautie, proud, and preſumptuous, by reading of the ſame.
                        This maner of ſaieng is no leſſe than a plaine blaſphemie againſt the holie Ghoſt. For the ſpirit of God is the author of his word, and ſo the holie Ghoſt is made the author of euill, which is a moſt great blaſphemie, and (as the ſcripture ſaith) a ſinne that ſhall not bee forgiuen in this world, neither in the other to come. It were all our parts and duties, to procure and ſeeke all the waies and meanes poſſible, to haue more knowledge of Gods word ſet foorth abroade in the world, & not allow ignorance, and diſcommend knowledge of Gods word, ſtopping the mouthes of the vnlearned with ſubtile and craftie perſuaſions of Philoſophie, and Sophiſtrie, whereof commeth no fruite, but a great perturbation of the mind to the ſimple & ignorant, not knowing which waie to turne them. For how is it not extreame wickedneſſe, to charge the holie ſanctified word of God with the offences of man? To alledge the ſcriptures to be perillous learning, becauſe certaine readers there of fall into hereſies?
                        Theſe men might be inforced by this kind of argument, to forſake the vſe of fire, becauſe fire burneth their neighbours houſe: or to abſteine from meate and drinke, becauſe they ſee manie ſurfet. O blind hate! They ſlander God for mans offence, & excuſe the man whome they ſee offend; and blame the ſcripture, which they can not improue. Yea I haue heard of ſome, that haue verie well vnderſtood the Latin tongue, that when they haue heard learned men perſuade to the credite and beleefe of certaine vnwritten verities (as they call them) which bee not in ſcripture expreſſed,

and yet taught as doctrine apoſtolike, and neceſſarie to bee beleeued; they haue beene of this opinion, that the learned men haue mo Epiſtles written by the Apoſtles of Chriſt, than wee haue abroad in the Canon of the old and new teſtament, or knowne of anie, but onlie to them of the Clergie. Which beleefe I did not a little lament in my hart to heare, that anie creature ſhould haue ſuch a blind ignorant opinion.
                        Some kind of ſimplicitie is to bee praiſed, but this ſimplicitie, without the veritie, I can neither praiſe nor allow. And thus it may bee ſeene, how wee that bee vnlettered remaine confuſed, without God of his grace lighten our harts and minds with a heauenlie light and knowledge of his will. For wee bee giuen of our ſelues to beleeue men better than God. I praie God ſend all learned men the ſpirit of God aboundantlie, that their doctrine may bring forth the fruits therof. I ſuppoſe there was neuer more neede of good doctrine to bee ſet foorth in the world than now in this age. For the carnall children of Adam, bee ſo wiſe in their generation, that if it were poſſible, they would deceiue the children of light. The world loueth his owne, and therefore their facts and doings be highlie eſteemed of the world: but the children of God are hated, bicauſe they bee not of the world. For their habitation is in heauen, and they do deſpiſe the world as a moſt vile ſlaue.
                        The fleſhlie children of Adam be ſo politike, ſubtile, craftie, and wiſe in their kind, that the elect ſhould bee illuded, if it were poſſible. For they are cloathed with Chriſts garment, in vtter appearance, with a faire ſhewe of all godlines, and holines in their words: but they haue ſo ſhorne, nopped, and turned Chriſts garment, and haue ſo diſguiſed themſelues, that the children of light beholding them with a ſpirituall eie, do accompt and take them for men which haue ſold their

maiſters garment, and haue ſtolne a peece of euerie mans garment. Yet by their ſubtile art, and craftie wits, they haue ſo ſet thoſe patches and peeces togither, that they do make the blind world, and carnall men to beleeue, it is Chriſts verie mantell.
                     
                     
                        The eleuenth Chapter, Of the vertuous properties of Gods children: of whome euerie one attendeth his vocation.
                        
                        
                           BUT the children of light knowe the contrarie: for they are led by the ſpirit of God, to the knowledge of the truth, and therefore they diſcerne and iudge all things right, and knowe from whence they come, euen from the biſhop of Rome, and his members, the headſpring of all pride, vaine glorie, ambition, hypocriſie, and feigned holines.
                        The children of God be not abaſhed, although the world hate them; they beleeue they are in the grace and fauour of God, and that he, as a beſt father, doth gouerne them in all things, putting awaie from them all vaine confidence and truſt in their owne doings. For they knowe they can doo nothing but ſin of themſelues. They bee not ſo fooliſh, and childiſh, not to giue God thanks for their election, which was before the beginning of the world. For they beleeue moſt ſurelie they bee of the choſen. For the holie Ghoſt doth witnes to their ſpirit, that they bee the children of God; and therefore they beleeue God better than man. They ſaie with Saint Paule, Who ſhall ſeparate vs from the loue of God? Shall tribulation, anguiſh, perſecution, hunger, nakedneſſe, perill, or ſword? As it is written, For thy ſake are we killed all daie long; and are counted as ſheepe appointed to bee ſlaine: neuertheleſſe, in all theſe things wee ouercome, through him that loueth vs. For I am ſure, that neither death, nor life, neither Angels, nor rule; neither power, neither

things preſent, neither things to come, neither quantitie or qualitie, neither anie creature, ſhall bee able to depart vs from the loue of God, which is in Chriſt Ieſu our Lord.
                        They are not by this godlie faith preſumptuouſlie inflamed, nor by the ſame become they looſe, idle, or ſlowe in dooing of godlie works, as carnall men dreme of them: ſo much the more feruent they be in dooing moſt holie and pure works, which God hath commanded them to walke in. They wander not in mens traditions and inuentions, leauing the moſt holie and pure precepts of God vndone, which they knowe they be bound to obſerue and keepe. Alſo they worke not like hirelings, for meede, wages, or reward; but as louing children, without reſpect of lucre, gaine, or hire. They be in ſuch libertie of ſpirit, and ioie ſo much in God, that their inward conſolation can not be expreſſed with tongue. All feare of damnation is gone from them; for they haue put their whole hope of ſaluation in his hands, which will and can performe it; neither haue they anie poſt or piller to leane to, but God, and his ſmooth and vnwrinkled Church. For he is to them all in all things, and to him they leane, as a moſt ſure ſquare piller, in proſperitie and aduerſitie, nothing doubting of his promiſes and couenants. For they beleeue moſt ſurelie they ſhall be fulfilled.
                        Alſo the children of God be not curious in ſearching the high myſteries of God, which be not meet for them to knowe: neither doo go about with humane and carnall reaſons to interpret Scripture, perſuading men by their ſubtile wits, and carnall doctrine, that much knowledge of Scripture maketh men heretikes, without they temper it with humane doctrine, Sophiſtrie, Philoſophie, and Logicke, wherewith to bee ſeduced according to the traditions of men, after the ordinances of the world, and not after Chriſt. S. Paul

doth moſt diligentlie admoniſh vs, which arts are not conuenient & meet to be made checkmate with Scripture. For the Scriptures be ſo pure and holie, that no perfection can be added vnto them. For euen as fine gold doth excell all other mettals, ſo doth the word of God, all mens doctrines. I beſeech the Lord to ſend the learned and vnlearned ſuch abundance of his holie ſpirit, that they may obeie and obſerue the moſt ſincere and holie word of God, and ſhew the fruits thereof, which conſiſteth chieflie in charitie and godlie vnitie: that as we haue profeſſed one God, one faith, and one baptiſme; ſo we may be all of one mind, and one accord, putting awaie all biting and gnawing. For in backbiting, ſlandering, and miſ-reporting our Chriſtian brethren, we ſhew not our ſelues the Diſciples of Chriſt, whom we profeſſe. In him was moſt high charitie, humilitie and patience, ſuffering moſt patientlie all ignominie, rebukes, and ſlanders, praieng to his eternall father for his enimies with moſt perfect charitie; and in all things did remit his will to his fathers, as the Scripture doth witneſſe, when he praied in the Mount. A godlie example and leſſon for vs to followe at all times and ſeaſons, as well in proſperitie, as in aduerſitie; to haue no will but Gods will, committing and leauing to him all our cares and greefes, and to abandon all our policies and inuentions. For they be moſt vaine, and fooliſh, and indeed verie ſhadowes and dreames.
                        But we be yet ſo carnall and fleſhlie, that we run headlong like vnbrideled colts, without ſnaffle or bridle. If we had the loue of God printed in our harts, it would keepe vs backe from running aſtraie. And vntill ſuch time as it pleaſe God to ſend vs this bit to hold vs in, we ſhall neuer run the right waie, although wee ſpeake and talke neuer ſo much of God and his word. The true followers of Chriſts doctrine haue alwaies

a reſpect, and an eie to their vocation. If they be called to the miniſterie of Gods word, they preach and teach it ſincerelie, to the edifieng of others; and ſhew themſelues in their liuing, followers of the ſame. If they be maried men, hauing children and familie, they nouriſh and bring them vp, without all bitterneſſe, and fierceneſſe, in the doctrine of the Lord, in all godlineſſe and vertue; committing the inſtruction of others, which apperteine not to their charge, to the reformation of God, and his miniſters, which chieflie be Kings and Princes, bearing the ſword euen for that purpoſe, to puniſh euill dooers. If they be children, they honour their father and mother, knowing it to be Gods commandement, and that he hath thereto annexed a promiſe of long life. If they be ſeruants, they obeie and ſerue their maiſters with all feare and reuerence, euen for the Lords ſake; neither with murmuring nor grudging, but with a free hart and mind.
                        If they be huſbands, they loue their wiues, as their owne bodies, after the example as Chriſt loued the congregation, and gaue himſelfe for it, to make it to him a ſpouſe without ſpot or wrinkle. If they be women maried, they learne of S. Paule to be obedient to their huſbands, and to keepe ſilence in the congregation, and to learne of their huſbands at home. Alſo they weare ſuch apparell as becommeth holineſſe, & comlie vſage, with ſoberneſſe; not being accuſers or detractors, not giuen to much eating of delicate meats, and drinking of wine; but they teach honeſt things, to make the yong women ſober minded, to loue their huſbands, to loue their children, to be diſcreet, chaſte, houſwifelie, good, and obedient vnto their huſbands: that the word of God be not euill ſpoken of. Uerelie, if all ſorts of people would looke to their owne vocation, and ordeine the ſame according to Chriſts doctrine, we ſhould not haue ſo many eies and eares to other mens

faults as we haue. For we be ſo buſie and glad to find and eſpie out other mens dooings, that we forget, and can haue no time to weigh & ponder our owne, which after the word of God we ought firſt to reforme: and then we ſhall the better helpe an other with the ſtraw out of his eies.
                        But alas, we be ſo much giuen to loue and to flatter our ſelues, and ſo blinded with carnall affections, that we can ſee and perceiue no fault in our ſelues. And therfore it is a thing verie requiſite and neceſſarie for vs, to praie all with one hart and mind to God, to giue vs an heauenlie light and knowledge of our owne miſeries and calamities, that we may ſee them, and acknowledge them trulie before him.
                     
                     
                        The twelfe Chapter, The concluſion, with a Christian exhortation to the amendement of life.
                        
                        
                           IF anie man ſhall be offended at this my lamenting the faults of men, which be in the world, fantaſing with themſelues, that I doo it either of hatred or of malice, to anie ſort or kind of people; verelie in ſo dooing they ſhall doo me great wrong. For I thanke God by his grace, I hate no creature; yea I would ſaie more to giue witneſſe of my conſcience, that neither life, honour, riches, neither whatſoeuer I poſſeſſe here, which appertaineth to mine owne priuate commoditie, be it neuer ſo deerlie beloued of mee, but moſt willinglie and gladlie I would leaue it, to win anie man to Chriſt, of what degree or ſort ſoeuer he were. And yet is this nothing in compariſon to the charitie that God hath ſhewed me, in ſending Chriſt to die for me. No, if I had all the charitie of Angels, and Apoſtles, it ſhould be but like a ſparke of fire compared to a great heape of burning coales.
                        
                           
God knoweth of what intent and mind I haue lamented mine owne ſinnes and faults to the world. I truſt no bodie will iudge that I haue done it for praiſe or thanke of anie creature; ſince rather I might be aſhamed, than reioice in rehearſall thereof. For if they knewe how little I eſteeme and weigh the praiſe of the world, that opinion were ſoone remooued and taken awaie. For I thanke God (by his grace) I knowe the world to be a blind iudge, and the praiſes therof vaine, and of little moment: and therefore I ſeeke not the praiſes of the ſame, neither to ſatiſfie it none otherwiſe than I am taught by Chriſt to doo, according to chriſtian charitie. I would to God we would all (when occaſion doth ſerue) confeſſe our faults to the world, all reſpects of our owne commoditie laid apart. But alas, ſelfe-loue doth ſo much reigne among vs, that (as I haue ſaid before) we can not eſpie our owne faults. And although ſomtime we find our owne guilt, either we be fauourable to interpret it no ſin: or elſe we be aſhamed to confeſſe our ſelues thereof. Yea, and we be ſore offended and greeued, to heare our faults charitablie and godlie told vs of other, putting no difference betweene charitable warning, & malicious accuſing.
                        Trulie, if we ſought Gods glorie, as we ſhould doo in all things, we ſhould not be aſhamed to confeſſe our ſelues to digreſſe from Gods precepts and ordinances; when it is manifeſt we haue done, and dailie doo. I praie God our owne faults and deeds condemne vs not at the laſt daie, when euerie man ſhall be rewarded according to his dooings. Trulie, if we doo not redreſſe and amend our liuing, according to the doctrine of the Goſpell; we ſhall receiue a terrible ſentence of Chriſt the ſonne of God, when he ſhall come to iudge and condemne all tranſgreſſours and breakers of his precepts and commandements; and to reward all his obedient and louing children. We ſhall haue no man

of lawe to make our plea for vs, neither can we haue the daie deferred, neither will the Iudge be corrupted with affection, bribes, or reward; neither will he heare anie excuſe or delaie, neither ſhall this Saint or that Martyr helpe vs, be they neuer ſo holie; neither ſhall our ignorance ſaue vs from damnation. But yet wilfull blindneſſe, and obſtinate ignorance ſhall receiue greater puniſhment, and not without iuſt cauſe. Then ſhall it be knowne who hath walked in the darke. For all things ſhall appeere manifeſt before him. No mans deeds ſhall be hidden; no, neither words, nor thoughts. The poore and ſimple obſeruers of Gods commandements ſhall be rewarded with euerlaſting life, as obedient children to the heauenlie Father: and the tranſgreſſors, adders, and diminiſhers of the lawe of God, ſhall receiue eternall damnation for their iuſt reward. I beſeech God we may eſcape this fearefull ſentence, and be found ſuch faithfull ſeruants, and louing children, that we may heare the happie, comfortable, and moſt ioifull ſentence ordeined for the children of God, which is; Come hither ye bleſſed of my father, and receiue the kingdome of heauen, prepared for you before the beginning of the world. Unto the Father, the Sonne, and the holie Ghoſt, be all honour and glorie world without end,
                     
                     Amen.

                           MOſt benigne Lord Ieſu, grant me thy grace, that it may alwaie worke in mee, and perſeuere with me vnto the end.
                        Grant me, that I may euer deſire and will that, which is moſt pleaſant, and moſt acceptable to thee.
                        Thy will be my will, and my will be to followe alwaie thy will.
                        Let there be alwaie in me one will, and one deſire with thee, and that I haue no deſire to will, or not to will, but as thou wilt.
                        Lord, thou knoweſt what thing is moſt profitable, and moſt expedient for me.
                        
                           
Giue me therefore what thou wilt, as much as thou wilt, and when thou wilt.
                        Doo with me what thou wilt, as it ſhall pleaſe thee, and as ſhall be moſt to thine honour.
                        Put me where thou wilt, and freelie doo with me in all things after thy will.
                        Thy creature I am, and in thy hands, leade and turne me where thou wilt.
                        Lo, I am thy ſeruant, readie to all things that thou commandeſt. For I deſire not to liue to my ſelfe, but to thee.
                        Lord Ieſu, I praie thee grant me grace, that I neuer ſet my hart on the things of this world: but that all worldlie and carnall affections may vtterlie die, and be mortified in me.
                        Grant me aboue all things, that I may reſt in thee, and fullie quiet and pacifie my hart in thee.
                        For thou Lord art the verie true peace of hart, and the perfect reſt of the ſoule: & without thee all things be greeuous and vnquiet.
                        My Lord Ieſu, I beſeech thee, be with me in euerie place, and at all times; and let it be to me a ſpeciall ſolace, gladlie for thy loue to lacke all worldlie ſolace.
                        And if thou withdrawe thy comfort from me at any time, keepe me, O Lord, from deſperation, and make me patientlie to abide thy will and ordinance.
                        O Lord Ieſu, thy iudgments be righteous, and thy prouidence is much better for me, than all that I can imagine or deuiſe.
                        Wherfore doo with me in all things as it ſhall pleaſe thee. For it may not be but well, all that thou dooeſt.
                        If thou wilt that I be in light, be thou bleſſed: if thou wilt that I be in darkneſſe, be thou alſo bleſſed.
                        If thou vouchſafe to comfort me, be thou highlie bleſſed: if thou wilt I liue in trouble, and without comfort, be thou like wiſe euer bleſſed.
                        
                           
Lord giue mee grace gladlie to ſuffer whatſoeuer thou wilt ſhall fall vpon me, and patientlie to take it at thy hand: good and bad, bitter and ſweete, ioie and ſorrowe: and for all things that ſhall befall vnto me, hartilie to thanke thee.
                        Keepe me Lord from ſinne, and I ſhall then neither dread death, nor hell.
                        O what thanks ought I to giue vnto thee, which haſt ſuffered the greeuous death of the croſſe, to deliuer me from my ſinnes, and to obtaine euerlaſting life for me!
                        Thou gaueſt vs moſt perfect example of patience, fulfilling and obeieng the will of thy father, euen vnto the death.
                        Make me wretched ſinner, obedientlie to vſe my ſelfe after thy will in althings, and patientlie to beare the burden of this corruptible life.
                        For though this life be tedious, and as an heauie burden to my ſoule: yet neuertheleſſe thorough thy grace, and by example of thee, it is now made much more eaſie and comfortable, than it was before thine incarnation and paſſion.
                        Thy holie life is our waie to thee, and by following of thee we walke to thee, that art our head and Sauiour: and yet, except thou hadſt gone before and ſhewed vs the waie to euerlaſting life; who would endeuor himſelfe to followe thee? Seeing we be yet ſo ſlowe and dull, hauing the light of thy bleſſed example and holie doctrine to leade and direct vs.
                        O Lord Ieſu, make that poſſible by grace, that is to me impoſſible by nature.
                        Thou knoweſt well that I may litle ſuffer, and that I am anon caſt downe and ouerthrowne with a little aduerſitie: wherfore I beſeech thee O Lord, to ſtrengthen me with thy ſpirit, that I may willinglie ſuffer for thy ſake, all maner of trouble and affliction.
                     
                     
                        
                        The ſecond Chapter, A confeſsion of our infirmities, with a deſire to reſt in God aboue all things.
                        
                        
                           LOrd, I will knowledge vnto thee all mine vnrighteouſneſſe, and I will confeſſe to thee all the vnſtableneſſe of my hart.
                        Oftentimes a verie little thing troubleth me ſore, and maketh mee dull and ſlowe to ſerue thee.
                        And ſometime I purpoſe to ſtand ſtronglie: but when a little trouble commeth, it is to mee great anguiſh and greefe, and of a right little thing riſeth a greeuous temptation to mee.
                        Yea when I thinke my ſelfe to bee ſure and ſtrong, and that (as it ſeemeth) I haue the vpper hand: ſuddenlie I feele my ſelfe readie to fall with a little blaſt of temptation.
                        Behold therefore (good Lord) my weakeneſſe, and conſider my fraileneſſe beſt knowne to thee.
                        Haue mercie on me, and deliuer me from all iniquitie and ſinne, that I bee not intangled therewith.
                        Oft times it greeueth mee ſore, and in a maner confoundeth mee, that I am ſo vnſtable, ſo weake, and ſo fraile, in reſiſting ſinfull motions.
                        Which although they drawe me not alwaie to conſent, yet neuertheleſſe their aſſaults bee verie greeuous vnto mee.
                        And it is tedious to mee to liue in ſuch battell, albeit I perceiue, that ſuch battell is not vnprofitable vnto mee: for thereby I knowe the better my ſelfe, and mine owne infirmities, and that I muſt ſeeke helpe onlie at thy hands.
                        O Lord God of Iſrael, the louer of all faithfull ſoules, vouchſafe to behold the labour and ſorowe of mee thy poore creature.
                        Aſſiſt mee in all things with thy grace, and ſo ſtrengthen

me with heauenlie ſtrength, that neither my cruell enimie the feend, neither my wretched fleſh (which is not yet ſubiect to the ſpirit) haue victorie or dominion ouer mee.
                        O what a life may this bee called, where no trouble nor miſerie lacketh! Where euerie place is full of ſnares of mortall enimies!
                        For one trouble or temptation ouerpaſſed, another commeth by and by; and the firſt conflict yet during, a new battell ſuddenlie ariſeth.
                        Wherefore Lord Ieſu, I praie thee giue me thy grace, to reſt in thee aboue all things, and to quiet mee in thee aboue all creatures, aboue all glorie and honour, aboue all dignitie and power, aboue all cunning and policie, aboue all health and beautie, aboue all riches and treaſure, aboue all ioie and pleaſure, aboue all fame and praiſe, aboue all mirth and conſolation that mans hart may take or feele beſides thee.
                        For thou Lord God, art beſt, moſt wiſe, moſt high, moſt mightie, moſt ſufficient, and moſt full of all goodneſſe, moſt ſweet, and moſt comfortable, moſt faire, moſt louing, moſt noble, moſt glorious, in whom all goodnes moſt perfectlie is.
                        And therefore, whatſoeuer I haue beſides thee, it is nothing to mee. For my hart may not reſt, ne fullie bee pacified, but onlie in thee.
                        O Lord Ieſu, moſt louing ſpouſe; who ſhall giue mee wings of perfect loue, that I may flie vp from theſe worldlie miſeries, and reſt in thee?
                        O when ſhall I aſcend to thee, and feele how ſweet thou art?
                        When ſhall I wholie gather my ſelfe in thee ſo perfectlie, that I ſhall not for thy loue feele my ſelfe, but thee onlie aboue my ſelfe, & aboue all worldlie things, that thou maiſt vouchſafe to viſit mee in ſuch wiſe, as thou dooeſt viſit thy moſt faithfull louers?
                        
                           
Now I often mourne and complaine of the miſeries of this life, and with ſorowe and great heauineſſe ſuffer them.
                        For manie things happen dailie to mee, which oftentimes trouble mee, make mee heauie, and darken mine vnderſtanding.
                        They hinder mee greatlie, and put my mind from thee, and ſo encumber me manie waies, that I can not freelie and cleerelie deſire thee, ne haue thy ſweet conſolations, which with thy bleſſed Saints be alwaie preſent.
                        I beſeech thee, Lord Ieſu, that the ſighings and inward deſires of my hart may moue and incline thee to heare mee.
                     
                     
                        The third Chapter. A recounting of Gods benefits, with praier to obtaine a free and cleane mind, with hartie wiſdome and deliuerance.
                        
                           OIeſu, King of euerlaſting glorie, the ioie and comfort of all Chriſtian people, that are wandering as Pilgrims in the wildernes of this world: my hart crieth to thee by ſtill deſires, and my ſilence ſpeaketh vnto thee, and ſaith: How long tarieth my Lord God to come to mee?
                        Come O Lord, and viſit mee: for without thee I haue no true ioie, without thee my ſoule is heauie and ſad.
                        I am in priſon, and bounden with fetters of ſorowe, till thou O Lord, with thy gratious preſence vouchſafe to viſit me, and to bring me againe to libertie and ioie of ſpirit, and to ſhew thy fauourable countenance vnto me.
                        Open my hart (Lord) that I may behold thy lawes, and teach me to walke in thy commandements.
                        Make me to knowe and folowe thy will, and to haue alwaies in my remembrance thy manifold benefits, that I may yeeld due thanks to thee for the ſame.
                        
                           
But I knowledge and confeſſe for truth, that I am not able to giue thee condigne thanks, for the leaſt benefit that thou haſt giuen me.
                        O Lord, all gifts and vertues that anie man hath, in bodie or ſoule, naturall or ſupernaturall, be thy gifts, and come of thee, and not of our ſelues; and they declare the great riches of thy mercie and goodneſſe vnto vs.
                        And though ſome haue mo gifts than other; yet they all proceed from thee, and without thee the leaſt cannot be had.
                        O Lord, I accompt it for a great benefit, not to haue manie worldlie gifts, whereby the laud and praiſe of men might blind my ſoule, and deceiue me.
                        Lord, I knowe that no man ought to be aſhamed or miſcontent, that he is in a lowe eſtate in this world, and lacketh the pleaſures of this life; but rather to be glad and reioice thereat:
                        For ſo much as thou haſt choſen the poore and meeke perſons, and ſuch as are deſpiſed in the world, to be thy ſeruants and familiar friends.
                        Witneſſe be thy bleſſed Apoſtles, whome thou madeſt chiefe paſtours and ſpirituall gouernours of thy flocke, which departed from the counſel of the Jewes, reioiſing that they were counted worthie to ſuffer rebuke for thy name.
                        Euen ſo (O Lord) grant that I thy ſeruant may be as well content to be taken as the leaſt, as other be to be greateſt; and that I be as well pleaſed to be in the loweſt place, as in the higheſt; and as glad to be of no reputation in the world for thy ſake, as other are to be noble and famous.
                        Lord, it is the worke of a perfect man, neuer to ſequeſter his mind from thee; and among manie worldlie cares to go without care: not after the maner of an idle or a diſſolute perſon, but by the prerogatiue of a

free mind, alwaie minding heauenlie things, and not cleauing by inordinate affection to anie creature.
                        I beſeech thee therefore, my Lord Ieſu, keepe me from the ſuperfluous cares of this world, that I be not inquieted with bodilie neceſſities; ne that I be not taken with the voluptuous pleaſures of the world, ne of the fleſh.
                        Preſerue me from all things, which hinder my ſoule health, that I be not ouerthrowne with them.
                        O Lord God, which art ſweetneſſe vnſpeakable, turne into bitterneſſe to me all worldlie and fleſhlie delights, which might drawe me from the loue of eternall things, to the loue of ſhort and vile pleaſures.
                        Let not fleſh and bloud ouercome me, ne yet the world with his vaine glorie deceiue me, nor the feend with his manifold crafts ſupplant me: but giue me ghoſtlie ſtrength in reſiſting them, patience in ſuffering them, and conſtancie in perſeuering to the end.
                        Giue me for all worldlie delectations, the moſt ſweet conſolation of thy holie ſpirit, and for all fleſhlie loue, indue my ſoule with feruent loue of thee.
                        Make me ſtrong inwardlie in my ſoule, and caſt out thereof all vnprofitable cares of this world, that I be not led by vnſtable deſires of earthlie things: but that I may repute all things in this world (as they be) tranſitorie and ſoone vaniſhing awaie, and my ſelfe alſo with them, drawing toward mine end.
                        For nothing vnder the ſunne may long abide; but all is vanitie, and affliction of ſpirit.
                        Giue me (Lord) therefore heauenlie wiſdome, that I may learne to ſeeke and find thee, & aboue all things to loue thee.
                        Giue me grace to withdrawe me from them that flatter me, and patientlie to ſuffer them that vniuſtlie greeue me.
                        Lord, when temptation or tribulation commeth,

vouchſafe to ſuccour me, that all may turne to my ghoſtlie comfort, and patientlie to ſuffer, and alwaie to ſaie, Thy name be bleſſed.
                        
                        Lord, trouble is now at hand; I am not well, but I am greatlie vexed with this preſent affliction. O moſt glorious father, what ſhall I do? Anguiſh and trouble are on euerie ſide, helpe now, I beſeech thee in this houre: thou ſhalt be lauded and praiſed, when I am perfectlie made meeke before thee, and when I am cleerelie deliuered by thee.
                        May it therefore pleaſe thee to deliuer me. For what may I moſt ſinfull wretch do? Or whether may I go for ſuccour, but to thee?
                        Giue mee patience now at this time in all my troubles; helpe me, Lord God, and I ſhall not feare ne dread, what trouble ſo euer fall vpon me.
                        And now, what ſhall I ſaie, but that thy will be done in me? I haue deſerued to be troubled and greeued; and therefore it behooueth that I ſuffer, as long as it pleaſeth thee.
                        But would to God that I might ſuffer gladlie, till the furious tempeſts were ouerpaſſed, and that quietneſſe of hart might come againe.
                        Thy mightie hand, Lord, is ſtrong ynough to take this trouble from me, & to aſſwage the cruell aſſaults thereof with them, as thou haſt oftentimes done before this time; that when I am cleerelie deliuered by thee, I may with gladneſſe ſaie, The right hand of him that is higheſt, hath made this change.
                        
                     
                     
                        The fourth Chapter, To deſpiſe all things in the world, and yeeld our ſelues vp to God, that he may be all in all for our redemption in time of neede.
                        
                        
                           LOrd grant me thy ſingular grace, that I may come thither where no creature ſhall let me ne keepe me from the perfect beholding of thee.
                        
                           
For as long as anie tranſitorie thing keepeth me backe, or hath rule in me, I may not freelie aſcend to thee.
                        O Lord, without thee nothing may long delight or pleaſe: for if anie thing ſhould be liking and ſauourie, it muſt be through helpe of thy grace, ſeaſoned with the ſpice of thy wiſedome.
                        O euerlaſting light, far paſſing all things, ſend downe the beames of thy brightneſſe from aboue, and purifie and lighten the inward parts of my hart.
                        Quicken my ſoule, and all the powers thereof, that it may cleaue faſt, and be ioined to thee in ioifull gladneſſe, and ghoſtlie rauiſhings.
                        O when ſhall that bleſſed houre come, that thou ſhalt viſit me, and glad me with thy bleſſed preſence; when thou ſhalt be to me all in all? Uerelie vntill that time come, there can be no perfect ioie in me.
                        But alas, mine old man, that is, my carnall affections liue ſtill in me, and are not crucified nor perfectlie dead.
                        For yet ſtriueth the fleſh againſt the ſpirit, and moueth great battell inwardlie againſt me, and ſuffereth not the kingdome of my ſoule to liue in peace.
                        But thou good Lord, that haſt the Lordſhip ouer all, and power of the ſea, to aſſwage the rages and ſurges of the ſame, ariſe and helpe me; deſtroie the power of mine enimies, which alwaies make battell againſt me: ſhew foorth the greatneſſe of thy goodneſſe, and let the power of thy right hand be glorified in me. For there is to me none other helpe nor refuge, but in thee onlie my Lord, my God: to thee be honour and glorie euerlaſting.
                        O Lord grant me, that I may wholie reſigne myſelfe to thee, and in all things to forſake my ſelfe, and patientlie to beare my croſſe, and to followe thee.
                        O Lord, what is man, that thou vouchſafeſt to haue

mind of him, and to viſit him?
                        Thou art alwaie one, alwaie good, alwaie righteous and holie, iuſtlie and bleſſedlie diſpoſing all things after thy wiſdome.
                        But I am a wretch, and of my ſelfe alwaie readie and prone to euill, and do neuer abide in one ſtate, but manie tunes doo varie and change.
                        Neuertheleſſe, it ſhall be better with me, when it ſhall pleaſe thee. For thou O Lord onelie art he that maieſt helpe me; and thou maieſt ſo confirme and ſtabliſh me, that my hart ſhall not be changed from thee, but be ſurelie fixed, and finallie reſt and be quieted in thee.
                        I am nothing elſe of my ſelfe, but vanitie before thee, an vnconſtant creature, and a feeble. And therefore, whereof may I rightfullie glorie? Or why ſhould I looke to be magnified?
                        Who ſo pleaſeth himſelfe without thee, diſpleaſeth thee; and he that delighteth in mens praiſings, looſeth the true praiſe before thee.
                        The true praiſe is to be praiſed of thee: and the true ioie is to reioice in thee.
                        Wherefore, thy name O Lord, be praiſed, and not mine; thy works be magnified, and not mine; and thy goodneſſe be alwaies lauded and bleſſed.
                        Thou art my glorie, and the ioie of my hart, in thee ſhall I glorie and reioice, and not in my ſelfe, nor in anie worldlie honor or dignitie, which to thine eternall glorie compared, is but a ſhadowe, and a verie vanitie.
                        O Lord, we liue here in great darkneſſe, and are ſoone deceiued with the vanities of this world, and are ſoone greeued with a little trouble: yet if I could behold my ſelfe well, I ſhould plainelie ſee, that what trouble ſoeuer I haue ſuffered, it hath iuſtlie come vpon me, becauſe I haue often ſinned, & greeuouſlie offended thee.
                        To me therefore confuſion, and deſpite is due; but

to thee laud, honour and glorie.
                        Lord ſend me helpe in my troubles; for mans helpe is little woorth.
                        How often haue I beene diſappointed, where I thought I ſhould haue found friendſhip? And how often haue I found it, where as I leaſt thought?
                        Wherefore it is a vaine thing to truſt in man. For the true truſt and helth of man is onlie in thee.
                        Bleſſed be thou Lord therefore in all things, that happen vnto vs. For we be weake and vnſtable, ſoone deceiued, and ſoon changed from one thing to another.
                        O Lord God, moſt righteous Iudge, ſtrong and patient, which knoweſt the frailtie and malice of man; be thou my whole ſtrength and comfort in all neceſſities. For mine owne conſcience Lord ſufficeth not.
                        Wherefore to thy mercie I doo appeale, ſeeing no man may be iuſtified, ne appere righteous in thy ſight, if thou examine him after thy iuſtice.
                     
                     
                        The fift Chapter, Of the euerlasting daie, and anguish of this life.
                        
                        
                           OBleſſed manſion of thy heauenlie Citie! O moſt cleareſt daie of eternitie, whom the night may neuer darken!
                        This is the daie alwaie cleare and merrie, alwaie ſure, and neuer changing his eſtate.
                        Would to God this daie might ſhortlie appeare, and ſhine vpon vs, and that theſe worldlie fantaſies were at an end.
                        This daie ſhineth clearlie to thy Saints in heauen, with euerlaſting brightneſſe: but to vs pilgrims in earth it ſhineth obſcurelie, and as through a mirrour or glaſſe.
                        The heauenlie Citizens knowe how ioious this day is; but we outlawes, the children of Eue, weepe and

waile the bitter tediouſnes of our daie, that is of this preſent life, ſhort and euill, full of ſorowe and anguiſh,
                        Where man is oftentimes defiled with ſinne, incumbred with affliction, inquieted with troubles, wrapped in cares, buſied with vanities, blinded with errors, ouercharged with labours, vexed with temptations, ouercome with vaine delights and pleaſures of the world, and grieuouſlie tormented with penurie and neede.
                        O when ſhall the end come of all theſe miſeries?
                        When ſhall I be clearelie deliuered from the bondage of ſinne?
                        When ſhall I Lord haue onelie mind on thee, and fullie be glad and merrie in thee?
                        When ſhall I be free without letting, and be in perfect libertie of bodie and ſoule?
                        When ſhall I haue peace without trouble: peace within and without, and on euerie ſide ſtedfaſt & ſure?
                        O Lord Ieſu, when ſhall I ſtand and behold thee; and haue full ſight and contemplation of thy glorie?
                        When ſhalt thou be to me all in all? And when ſhall I be with thee in thy kingdome, that thou haſt ordeined for thine elect people from the beginning?
                        I am left here poore, and as an outlawe, in the land of mine enimies; where dailie be battels, and great miſfortunes.
                        Comfort mine exile, aſſwage my ſorowe; for all my deſire is to be with thee.
                        It is to me an vnpleaſant burden, what pleaſure ſoeuer the world offereth me here.
                        I deſire to haue inward fruition in thee; but I can not attaine thereto.
                        I couet to cleaue faſt to heauenlie things; but worldlie affections plucke my mind downeward.
                        I would ſubdue all euill affections; but they dailie rebell, and riſe againſt me, and will not be ſubiect vnto

my ſpirit.
                        Thus I wretched creature ſigh in my ſelfe, and am grieuous to my ſelfe, while my ſpirit deſireth to be vpward and contrarie, my fleſh draweth me downward.
                        O what ſuffer I inwardlie! I go about to mind heauenly things, and ſtreight a great rable of worldlie things ruſh into my ſoule.
                        Therefore, Lord, be not long awaie; ne depart thou in thy wrath from me.
                        Send me the light of thy grace; deſtroie in me all carnall deſires.
                        Send foorth the hot flames of thy loue, to burne and conſume the cloudie fantaſies of my mind.
                        Gather, O Lord, my wits, and the powers of my ſoule togither in thee; & make me to deſpiſe all worldlie things, and by thy grace ſtrongly to reſiſt and ouercome all motions and occaſions of ſinne.
                        Helpe me thou euerlaſting truth, that no worldlie guile nor vanitie hereafter haue power to deceiue me.
                        Come alſo thou heauenlie ſweetneſſe, and let all bitterneſſe of ſinne flie far from me. Pardon me, and forgiue me as oft as in my praier my mind is not ſurelie fixed on thee.
                        For manie times I am not there, where I ſtand or ſit; but rather there whither my thoughts carie me.
                        For there I am, where my thoughts be, and where as cuſtomablie is my thought, there is that that I loue.
                        And that oftentimes commeth into my mind, that by cuſtome pleaſeth me beſt; and that delighteth me moſt to thinke vpon.
                        Accordinglie as thou doſt ſay in thy goſpell: Where as a mans treaſure is, there is his hart.
                        Wherefore, if I loue heauen, I ſpeake gladlie therof, and of ſuch things as be of God, and of that that apperteineth to his honour, and to the glorie of his

holie name.
                        And if I loue the world, I loue to talke of worldlie things, and I ioie anon in worldlie felicitie, and ſorowe and lament ſoone for worldlie aduerſitie.
                        If I loue the fleſh, I imagine oftentimes that, that pleaſeth the fleſh.
                        If I loue my ſoule, I delight much to ſpeake and to heare of things that be for my ſoules health.
                        And whatſoeuer I loue, of that I gladlie heare, and ſpeake, and beare the images of them ſtill in my mind.
                        Bleſſed is the man that for the loue of the Lord, ſetteth not by the pleaſures of this world, and learneth trulie to ouercome himſelfe, and with the feruour of ſpirit crucifieth his fleſh; ſo that in a cleane and a pure conſcience he may offer his praiers to thee, and be accepted to haue companie of thy bleſſed Angels, all earthlie things excluded from his hart.
                     
                     
                        The ſixt Chapter, A ſweet praier, wherein being preſſed downe with troubles, we humblie yeeld our ſelues vnder the mightie hand of God our Creator.
                        
                           LOrd and holie Father, be thou bleſſed now and euer. For as thou wilt, ſo it is done; and that thou dooeſt is alwaie beſt.
                        Let me, thine humble and vnwoorthie ſeruant, ioie onelie in thee, and not in my ſelfe, ne in anie thing elſe beſides thee.
                        For thou Lord art my gladnes, my hope, my crowne, and all mine honour.
                        What hath thy ſeruant, but that ſhe hath of thee, and that without hir deſert.
                        All things be thine; thou haſt created and made them.
                        I am poore, and haue beene in trouble and paine, euer from my youth, and my ſoule hath beene in great heauineſſe

through manifold paſſions, that come of the world, and of the fleſh.
                        Wherefore Lord, I deſire that I may haue of thee the ioie of inward peace.
                        I aſke of thee to come to that reſt, which is ordeined for thy choſen children, that be fed and nouriſhed with the light of heauenlie comforts. For without thy helpe I can not come to thee.
                        Lord giue me peace, giue me inward ioie, and then my ſoule ſhall be full of heauenlie melodie, and be deuout and feruent in thy lauds and praiſes.
                        But if thou withdrawe thy ſelfe from me (as thou haſt ſometime done) then may not thy ſeruant runne the waie of thy commandements, as I did before.
                        For it is not with me, as it was when the Lampe of thy ghoſtlie preſence did ſhine vpon my head; and I was defended vnder the ſhadowe of thy wings from all perils and dangers.
                        O mercifull Lord Ieſu, euer to be praiſed; the time is come, that thou wilt prooue thy ſeruant; and rightfull it is, that I ſhall now ſuffer ſomewhat for thee.
                        Now is the houre come, that thou haſt knowne from the beginning, that thy ſeruant for a time ſhould outwardlie be ſet at naught, and inwardlie to leane vnto thee.
                        And that ſhe ſhould be deſpiſed in the ſight of the world, and be broken with affliction, that ſhe may after ariſe with thee in a new light, and be clarified, and made glorious in the kingdome of heauen.
                        O holie father, thou haſt ordeined it ſo to be; and it is done as thou haſt commanded.
                        This is thy grace (O Lord) to thy freend, to ſuffer hir to be troubled in this world for thy loue, how often ſo euer it be, and of what perſon ſo euer it be, and in what maner ſoeuer thou wilt ſuffer it to fall vnto hir. For without thy will or ſufferance, what thing is done

vpon the earth?
                        It is good to me, O Lord, that thou haſt meekened me, that I may therby learne to knowe thy righteous iudgements, & to put from me all maner of preſumption, and ſtatelineſſe of hart.
                        It is verie profitable for me, that confuſion hath couered my face; that I may learne thereby rather to ſeeke to thee for helpe and ſuccour, than to man.
                        I haue thereby learned to dread thy ſecret and terrible iudgements, which ſcourgeſt the righteous with the ſinner; but not without equitie and iuſtice.
                        Lord, I yeeld thanks to thee, that thou haſt not ſpared my ſinnes, but haſt puniſhed me with ſcourges of loue, and haſt ſent me affliction and anguiſh within and without.
                        No creature vnder heauen may comfort me, but thou Lord God, the heauenlie leach of mans ſoule, which ſtrikeſt and healeſt, which bringeſt a man nigh vnto death, and after reſtoreſt him to life againe, that he may thereby learne to knowe his owne weakeneſſe and imbecillitie, & the more fullie to truſt in the Lord.
                        Thy diſcipline is laid vpon me, and thy rod of correction hath taught me, and vnder that rod I wholie ſubmit me.
                        Strike my backe and my bones as it ſhall pleaſe thee; and make me to bow my crooked will to thy will.
                        Make me a meeke and an humble diſciple, as thou haſt ſometime done with me, that I may walke after thy will.
                        To thee I commit my ſelfe to be corrected. For better it is to be corrected by thee heere, than in time to come.
                        Thou knoweſt all things; and nothing is hid from thee that is in mans conſcience.
                        Thou knoweſt all things to come before they fall, & it is not needfull that anie man teach thee, or warne

thee of anie thing that is done vpon the earth.
                        Thou knoweſt what is profitable for me, and how much tribulations helpe to purge awaie the ruſt of ſinne in me.
                        Doo with me after thy pleaſure. I am a ſinfull wretch, to none ſo well knowne as to thee.
                        Grant me (Lord) that to knowe, that is neceſſarie to be knowne; that to loue, that is to be loued; that to deſire, that pleaſeth thee; that to regard, that is pretious in thy ſight; and that to refuſe, that is vile before thee.
                        Suffer me not to iudge thy myſteries after mine outward ſenſes, ne to giue ſentence after the hearing of the ignorant, but by true iudgement to diſcerne things ſpirituall; and aboue all things, alwaie to ſearch and followe thy will and pleaſure.
                        O Lord Ieſu, thou art all my riches, and all that I haue, I haue it of thee.
                        But what am I (Lord) that dare ſpeake to thee? I am thy poore creature, and a worme moſt abiect.
                        Behold Lord, I haue naught, and of my ſelfe I am naught worth. Thou art onlie God, righteous and holie; thou ordereſt all things, thou giueſt all things, and thou fulfilleſt all things with goodneſſe.
                        I am a ſinner, barren and void of godlie vertues.
                        Remember thy mercies, and fill my hart with plentie of thy grace. For thou wilt not that thy works in me ſhould be made in vaine.

                        Teach me (Lord) to fulfill thy will, to liue meekelie, and worthilie before thee. For thou art all my wiſdome

and cunning, thou art he that knoweſt me as I am, that kneweſt me before the world was made, & before I was borne or brought into this life. To thee (O Lord) be honour, glorie, and praiſe for euer and euer:

                     ¶ A certaine effectuall praier, made by the Ladie Jane Dudley, in the time of hir trouble, a little before hir death.
                     
                     
                        O Lord, thou GOD and father of my life, heare mee poore and deſolate Woman, which flieth vnto thee onelie in all my troubles and miſeries. Thou, O Lord, art the onlie defender and deliuerer of thoſe that put their truſt in thee. And therefore I, being defiled with ſinne, incumbred with affliction, vnquieted with troubles, wrapped in cares, ouerwhelmed with miſeries, vexed with temptations, and greeuouſlie tormented with the long impriſonment of this vile maſſe of claie, my ſinfull bodie and bloud, do come vnto thee O mercifull Sauiour, crauing thy mercie and helpe; without the which, ſo little hope of deliuerance is left, that I may vtterlie deſpaire of anie libertie. Albeit, it is expedient, that ſeeing our life ſtandeth vpon trieng, we ſhould be viſited ſometime with ſome aduerſitie, wherby we might both be tried, whether we be of thy flocke or no, and alſo knowe thee, and our ſelues the better: yet thou that ſaidſt, that thou wouldſt not ſuffer vs to be tempted

aboue our power; be mercifull vnto me now, a miſerable wretch, I beſeech thee; which with Salomon do crie vnto thee, humblie deſiring thee, that I may neither be too much puffed vp with proſperitie; neither too much preſſed downe with aduerſitie, leaſt I being too full, ſhould denie my God; or being too lowe brought, ſhould deſpaire, and blaſpheme thee my Lord and Sauiour.
                     O mercifull God, conſider my miſerie beſt knowne vnto thee, and be thou now vnto me a ſtrong tower of defence, I humblie require thee. Suffer me not to be tempted aboue my ſtrength and power, but either be thou a deliuerer vnto me out of this great miſerie, either elſe giue me grace patientlie to beare thy heauie hand, and ſharpe correction. It was thy right hand, O God, yt deliuered the people of Iſrael out of the hands of Pharao, which for the ſpace of four hundred yeares, did oppreſſe them, and keepe them in bondage. Let it therefore like wiſe ſeeme good to thy fatherlie goodnes, to deliuer me, ſorowfull wretch (for whome thy ſonne Chriſt ſhed his pretious bloud on the Croſſe) out of this miſerable captiuitie and bondage, wherein I am now.
                     How long wilt thou be abſent? For euer? Oh Lord, haſt thou forgotten to be gratious, and haſt thou ſhut vp thy louing kindneſſe in diſpleaſure▪ Wilt thou be no more intreated? Is thy mercie cleane gone for euer, and thy promiſe come vtterlie to an end for euermore? Why doeſt thou make ſo long tarieng? Shall I deſpaire of thy mercie oh God? Far be that from me. I am thy workemanſhip, created in Chriſt Ieſu; giue me grace therefore to tarie thy leaſure, and patientlie to beare thy works: aſſuredlie knowing, that as thou canſt, ſo thou wilt deliuer me, when it ſhall pleaſe thee, nothing doubting nor miſtruſting thy goodneſſe towards me. For thou woteſt better what is good for me,

than I doo.
                     Therefore doo with me in all things what thou wilt, and plague me what waie thou wilt; onelie in the meane time arme me, I beſeech thee, with thine armour, yt I may ſtand faſt, my loines being girded about with veritie, hauing on the breſtplate of righteouſnes, and ſhod with the ſhoes prepared by the Goſpell of peace: aboue all things taking to me the ſhield of faith, wherewith I may be able to quench all the firie darts of the wicked; and taking the helmet of ſaluation, and the ſword of the ſpirit, which is thy moſt holie word, praieng alwaies with all maner of praier and ſupplication, that I may referre my ſelfe wholie vnto thy will, abiding thy pleaſure, and comforting my ſelfe in thoſe troubles that it ſhall pleaſe thee to ſend me; ſeeing ſuch troubles be profitable for me, and ſeeing I am aſſuredlie perſuaded, that it cannot be but well all that thou doeſt. Heare me, oh mercifull father, for his ſake, whome thou wouldeſt ſhould be a ſlaine ſacrifice for my ſinnes, to whom with thee and the holie Ghoſt, be all honour and glorie for euer:
                     Amen.
                  
                  
                     An exhortation written by the Ladie IANE, the night before she ſuffered, in the end of the new Testament in Greeke, which ſhe ſent to hir ſiſter the Ladie Katherine.
                     
                     
                        
                           I
                         Haue here ſent you, good ſiſter Katherine, a Booke, which although it be not outwardlie trimmed with gold, yet inwardlie it is more worth than pretious ſtones. It is the booke (deere ſiſter) of the lawe of the Lord; it is his Teſtament and laſt will, which he bequeathed vnto vs wretches, which ſhall leade you to the path of eternall ioie. And if you, with a good mind reade it, and with an earneſt

deſire folowe it, it ſhall bring you to an immortall and euerlaſting life. It will teach you to liue, and learne you to die. It ſhall win you more than you ſhould haue gained by the poſſeſſions of your wofull fathers land. For as, if God had proſpered him, you ſhould haue inherited all his lands; ſo if you applie diligentlie this booke, ſeeking to direct your life after it, you ſhall be an inheritour of ſuch riches, as neither the couetous ſhall withdrawe from you, neither the theefe ſhall ſteale, neither yet the moths corrupt. Deſire with Dauid (good ſiſter) to vnderſtand the lawe of the Lord your God, liue ſtill to die, that you by death may obtaine eternall life: or after your death enioie the life purchaſed you by Chriſtes death. And truſt not that the tenderneſſe of your age ſhall lengthen your life. For as ſoone, if God call, goeth the yong as the old. And labour alwaie to learne to die, denie the world, defie the diuell, deſpiſe the fleſh, and delight your ſelfe onlie in the Lord. Be penitent for your ſins, and yet deſpair not; be ſtrong in faith, and yet preſume not: and deſire with Saint Paule to be diſſolued, and to be with Chriſt, with whome in death there is life. Be like the good ſeruant, and euen at midnight be waking, leaſt when death commeth, and ſtealeth vpon you like a theefe in the night, you be with the euill ſeruant found ſleeping: and leaſt for lacke of oile in your lampe, ye be found like to the fiue fooliſh virgins, and like him that had not on the wedding garment; and then be caſt out from the mariage. Reioice in Chriſt, as I truſt you do. And ſeeing you haue the name of a Chriſtian, as neere as you can, folowe the ſteps of your maiſter Chriſt, and take vp your croſſe; laie your ſinnes on his backe, and alwaies embrace him. And as touching my death, reioice, as I doo (good ſiſter) that I ſhall be deliuered of this corruption, and put on incorruption. For I am aſſured, that I ſhall for loſing of a mortall life, win an

immortall life, the which I praie God grant you, and ſend you of his graces, to liue in his feare, and to die in the true chriſtian faith, from the which in Gods name I exhort you that ye neuer ſwarue, neither for hope of life, nor feare of death. For if ye will denie his truth to lengthen your life, God will denie you, and yet ſhorten your daies. And if ye will cleaue to him, he will prolong your daies, to your comfort, and his glorie. To the which glorie God bring me now, and you heereafter, when it ſhall pleaſe God to call you. Farewell good ſiſter, and put your onlie truſt in God, who onlie muſt helpe you.

                           Let them reioice that repoſe themſelues and truſt alwaies in thy mercie; let them ſing Hymnes and Pſalmes, which doo glorie and reioice in thee, let them triumph which loue thy name.
                           Defend me, O Lord, with thy grace, as with a ſhield in time of perill; to the intent that when I am aſſaulted with them, I may yet with conſtant cheere growe vp vnto my full perfection.
                           Glorie be to the father, &c. As it was in the, &c.
                        
                        
                           The ſecond Pſalme.
                           
                              OH Lord GOD and father, I beſeech thee by Chriſt our Lord, that of thine infinite mercie thou keepe me, ſo as at no time I followe the counſell of the vngodlie, which knowe thee not; or of Hypocrites, which with their harts ſeeke thee not.
                           O Lord, ſuffer me not to enter into the waie of ſinners, with a mind to fulfill the deſires and luſts of the fleſh.
                           But whenſoeuer through frailtie of my corrupt nature. I ſhall chance to run aſtraie, then O Lord, ſtaie me, and plucke my foote backe againe.
                           Keepe me, that I ſit not in the ſeate of peſtilent ſcorners,

which cloaking their Phariſaicall and diuelliſh intents, condemne in other men thy veritie & Goſpell.
                           Oh Lord, bring to paſſe that I may burne in the deſire of thy lawe, that vpon the aduancement of thy word my mind may alwaies be occupied, that I may euermore chooſe that which is moſt pleaſant to thee, and hate that both in my ſelfe and others, which to thee is diſpleaſant.
                           Make I praie thee that I may be a tree planted by the ſweet riuers of thy ghoſtlie waters, to the intent I may bring foorth fruit to thy glorie, and to the profit of my neighbour, as often as thou ſhalt miniſter time and occaſion therevnto.
                           Leaſt my leaues, which are my words and works ſhould fade and fall awaie; but that all things may proſper, whatſoeuer I ſhall doo in thy name.
                           Aſſiſt me, I beſeech thee, and grant O moſt mercifull father, that for Ieſu Chriſts ſake I may take roote in the ground of life; leaſt with the vngodlie, like chaffe and duſt I be blowne abrode with the moſt pernicious winds of this world.
                           And grant that I may ſtand in the aſſemblie of the righteous, and that I may enter into iudgment without puniſhment; and eſcape euerlaſting damnation.
                           Glorie be to the father, &c. As it was in the begin, &c.
                        
                        
                           The third Pſalme.
                           
                              TO thee, O Lord, I lift vp my mind, in thee I truſt, O Lord God; let me not be confounded, leaſt mine enimies make me a ieſting ſtocke, and a matter to laugh at.
                           O Lord make thy waies knowne vnto me, and trade me in thy paths.
                           Direct me in thy truth, and inſtruct me; for thou art God my Sauiour, I looke after thee euerie daie.
                           O Lord thou art ſweet and rightfull, and bringeſt

againe into the waie them which went out.
                           Thou leadeſt ſtrait into thy iudgement, them that be mild and tractable, and teacheſt them that be meeke thy word and teſtimonies.
                           Thou healeſt them that be contrite in hart, and aſſwageſt their paines and griefe.
                           Thou holdeſt vp all them which elſe ſhould fall, and all that are fallen thou lifteſt vp againe.
                           Thou giueſt ſight to the blind, and looſeſt them that be bound.
                           Thou art nigh vnto all them that call vpon thee, ſo that they call vpon thee faithfullie.
                           Thou fulfilleſt the deſire of them that doo feare thee, and heareſt their praier, and ſaueſt them.
                           Haue mercie vpon me, O God, haue mercie vpon me, for in thee my ſoule truſteth.
                           Uerelie my ſoule hath a ſpeciall reſpect to thee. For my health, my glorie, and all my ſtrength cōmeth from thee.
                           For thine owne ſake, oh Lord God, laie not my ſins to my charge.
                           I vnderſtand not all mine errours, innumerable troubles doo cloſe me round about, my ſinnes haue taken hold vpon me, and I am not able to looke vp.
                           Put to thy hand to helpe me, and leade me right in all my works.
                           Make me to walke perfectlie in thy waies, that no kind of ſinne ouercome me.
                           Set a watch before my mouth; and keepe the doore of my lips.
                           Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my hart be euer pleaſant and acceptable in thy ſight.
                           Let the word of truth neuer go awaie from my mouth, and ſuffer no malice to dwell in my hart.
                           O Lord deliuer my ſoule from lieng lips, and ſaue me from the deceitfull tongue.
                           
                              
Put into my mouth thy true and holie word, and take from me all idle and vnfruitfull ſpeech.
                           Deliuer me from falſe ſurmiſes and accuſations of men: rule me euen as thou thinkeſt good, after thy will and pleaſure.
                           Turne awaie mine eies, that they behold no vaine things; faſten them in thy waie.
                           Take from me fornication and all vncleanneſſe, and let not the loue of the fleſh beguile me.
                           Yea deliuer my ſoule from pride, that it doo not reigne in me, and then ſhall I be cleane from the greateſt ſinne.
                           Staie and keepe my feete from euerie euill waie, leaſt my ſteps ſwarue from thy paths.
                           Mine eies looke euer vnto thee, O Lord, bicauſe thou art nigh at hand, and all thy waies be the truth.
                           Thy mercies be great and manie, O Lord, bleſſed is he whoſoeuer truſteth in thee.
                           For when I ſaid vnto thee, My feete be ſlipped, thy mercie, O Lord, by and by did hold me vp.
                           Teach me to doo thy will, and leade me by thy path-waie, for thou art my God.
                           Oh Lord, ſaue my ſoule, and deliuer me from the power of darkneſſe.
                           Let the brightneſſe of thy face ſhine vpon thy ſeruant, for vnto thee, O Lord God, I haue fled for ſuccor.
                           Looke vnto me, and haue mercie vpon me; for I am deſolate and poore.
                           Keepe my ſoule and deliuer me, that I be not confounded. For I haue truſted in thee.
                           O Lord God, forſake me not, although I haue done no good in thy ſight.
                           For thy goodneſſe grant me, that at the leaſt-wiſe now I may begin to liue well.
                           O Lord ſhew thy ſeruants thy works, and their children thy glorie; and the gratious maieſtie of the Lord

our God be vpon vs. Oh proſper thou the works of our hands, oh proſper thou our handie works.
                           Glorie be to the Father, the Sonne, and the holie Ghoſt.
                           As it was in the beginning, is now, and euer ſhall be, world without end,
                           Amen.
                        
                        
                           A contemplation of Chriſtes Paſsion.
                           
                           
                              O What loue and mercie of man vndeſerued from God the father, through his onlie ſonne Ieſu Chriſt, by whoſe fleſh and bloud we haue cleane remiſſion of our offences; when we call to mind this myſterie of our redemption, and our ſufficient ſacrifice, whereby ſinne, death and hell be put to exile; and grace, mercie and peace be obteined! For this we haue not onlie occaſion to lament our ſelues, which were the verie cauſes why Ieſus did lament in care, and became poore in bodie, ſweat water and bloud againſt his death, praied in affliction, and ſuffered for our redemption: but alſo to giue dailie thanks, and to reioice to God the father, for this his ſonne, by whom we haue felowſhip with Angels, and are become Citizens of the ſaints, and of the houſhold of God, partakers of euerlaſting life for euer. O happie be they which forget not this heauenlie Philoſophie, this giltleſſe paſſion of Ieſu Chriſt! To knowe & beleeue this, is life euerlaſting, and the quietneſſe of conſcience. This paſſion is our riches in pouertie, and helpe in aduerſitie, and onlie life in death. By this his painefull affliction, were all the Patriarches, Prophets, Martyrs, and euerie beleeuing bodie ſaued, that euer was, or ſhall be; without which all fleſh is damned and accurſed. Now ſweet Chriſt, for this thy bleſſed oblation, haue mercie on me now and in the houre of death; that in the dreadfull daie of iudgment, ſinne, death and hell may not preuaile againſt me ſinfull

creature, but haue mercie vpon me, according to thy greateſt mercie, which is this thy death and paſſion, for which be praiſe to the holie Trinitie for euer and euer,
                           Amen.
                        
                        
                           The Hymne of the paſſion of Chriſt.
                           
                           
                              IEſus which is the liuelie well of wiſdome,
                              And the heauenlie truth of the father eternall,
                              Which from heauen to this world did come,
                              To deliuer vs thrales from paines infernall,
                              Of Iudas was ſold, and of the Iewes taken,
                              And of his Diſciples at midnight was forſaken.
                           
                           
                              We laud thee father for thy grace,
                              We praiſe the ſonne which made vs free,
                              We thanke the holie ſpirit for our ſolace,
                              Which is one God and perſons three.
                           
                           
                              In the dawning of the daie they did him faſt bind,
                              And before Pilate he was then conuented,
                              Falſe witneſſe againſt Ieſus they did then find,
                              When the cruell Seniours in iudgement him preſented,
                              Beaten was his bodie, defiled was his face,
                              And yet God and man, the verie well of grace.
                           
                           
                              We laud thee father, &c.
                           
                           
                              When thrée houres were paſt, before Pilates throne,
                              All the people cried, Kill Ieſus the Iewes king,
                              His crowne was thornes, in purple he made mone,
                              With a croſſe ouer Cedron they did him bring,
                              And prepared his deadlie place on Galgatha hill,
                              To ſuffer pains for Adams gilt, ſo was his fathers will.
                           
                           
                              We laud thee father, &c.
                           
                           
                              The ſirt houre approched his painefull end,
                              When on the trée his bodie they nailed,
                              In heauen was his helpe, in earth he had no freud,
                              He died betwéene two théeues, on him the Elders railed,
                              
                                 
Then he thirſted for his elect, which ſubiect were to thrall,
                              Unthankefullie they offred him vinegre mingled with gall.
                           
                           
                              We laud thee father, &c.
                           
                           
                              This verie God, Gods onlie begotten child,
                              Said to his father, Why haſt thou me forſaken?
                              Yet receiue this ſacrifice, and my ſpirit vndefild:
                              The heauens were darkned, aſunder the ſtones were ſhaken.
                              Bloud and water then ſprang from this bleſſed lamb,
                              Then graues opened, the dead aliue foorth came.
                           
                           
                              We laud thee father for thy grace, &c.
                           
                        
                        
                           The ſecond Meditation or praier of our frailtie and miſerie.
                           
                           
                              O Miſerable wretched woman that I am, how may I be compared to any of thy ſaints that ſhall dwell in thy Tabernacle or holie hill? For they loue to be in holie contemplation: and I in the vaine multitude, forgetting thee: they be meeke, and I vnpatient: they do not forget thee, but my good Lord, when do I remember thee, but when affliction enforceth me; or the lamentable fall of my breethren conſtraine me to thanke thee? Thou moſt mightie and fearefull God of hoſts, thy holie name be bleſſed foreuer, Amen. What ſhall I ſaie my God? Thou art moſt good, and I euill; thou holie, and I miſerable; thou art light, and I am blind; thou art the bleſſed ioie, and I am carefull and full of ſorowe. My Lord, thou art the Phyſician, and I the miſerable patient; I am nothing but vanitie and corrupt, as euerie liuing man is. What ſhall I ſaie (O Creator) but this, that I am thy creature, and ſhall I periſh? Thy hands haue made me, and were wounded for me; thy bloud was ſhed for me, and hath waſhed me; thy holie Ghoſt hath ſanctified me, and taught me: yet Lord, my daies are nothing. What ſhould I mortall creature

thus talke with my ſelfe, Lord God, but that need hath no lawe? Sorowe hath compelled me to ſeeke comfort, ſickneſſe enforceth me to folowe the Phyſician, conſcience pricketh me to crie to thee my Lord for a heauenlie cordiall of comfort, which am in great diſcomfort, borne of a woman, full of miſerie and ſhortneſſe of time, and paſſe awaie like a ſhadowe, neuer content with one eſtate, but in earth remaine for euer.

                              O Creator, to thée thy creature I call,
                              Who made of mould do liue in paine,
                              And ſicke in ſoule, my fleſh is thrall,
                              O wo is me, my daies be vaine:
                              Yet vnto God I call for grace,
                              My ſoule in heauen to haue a place.
                           
                        
                        
                           A praier to the bleſſed Trinitie. Let vs praie.
                           
                              O Holie, bleſſed, and glorious Trinitie, three equall, and coeternall perſons, but one God almightie, haue mercie vpon me vile, abiect, abhominable, and ſinfull wretch, meekelie acknowledging before thy diuine Maieſtie my long continued life in ſinne, euen from my childhood hitherto. Then good gratious Lord, as thou giueſt me the grace to acknowledge them; ſo giue me grace not in word onlie, but in hart alſo, with ſorowfull contrition to repent, and vtterlie to forſake them. Forgiue me alſo thoſe ſinnes, through which by mine owne fault, wicked affection, and euill cuſtome, my reaſon is with ſenſualitie ſo blinded, as I cannot diſcerne them for ſinne. Illuminate my hart (good Lord) and giue me grace to

acknowledge them. Forgiue me my ſinnes negligentlie forgotten, and bring them to my mind, with grace to be throughlie repentant for them.
                           O mercifull God, grant me thy grace ſo to deſpiſe ſinne, and all worldlie vanities, that I may ſaie with the bleſſed Apoſtle Saint Paule: The world is crucified to me, and I to the world; Chriſt is to me life, and to die is my gaine and aduantage; I deſire to be looſed, and to be with Chriſt. Lord giue me thy grace to amend my life, and to haue an eie to mine end, without anie grudge, or feare of death, which to them that die in thee, is the gate of eternall life.
                           Almightie God, teach me to doo thy will; take my right hand, and leade me in the true waie from mine: drawe me after thee, bind my mouth with ſnaffle and bridle, when I will not drawe vnto thee. Oh gratious God, all ſinfull feare, all ſinfull ſorowe and penſiueneſſe, all ſinfull hope, all ſinfull mirth and gladneſſe take awaie from me. On the other ſide, concerning ſuch feare, ſuch heauineſſe, ſuch comfort, conſolation, and gladneſſe, as ſhall be profitable for my ſoule, doo with me according to thy great goodneſſe.
                           O Lord giue me grace, in all my feare and agonie, to haue recourſe to that great feare and wonderfull agonie that thou my ſauiour hadſt at the Mount of Oliuet, before thy moſt bitter paſſion; and in the meditation thereof to conceiue ghoſtlie comfort and conſolation, profitable for my ſoule. Almightie God, take from me all vaine-glorious minds, all appetites of mine owne praiſe, all enuie, couetiſe, gluttonie, ſloth and lecherie, all wrathfull affection, all appetite of reuenging, all deſire of delight of other mens harmes, all pleaſure in prouoking anie perſon to wrath and anger: all delight in taunting or mocking anie perſon in their affliction or trouble. And giue vnto me, O Lord, an humble, quiet, peaceable, patient, charitable,

kind, tender, and pitifull mind, in all my words, my works, and thoughts, to haue a taſt of thy holie and bleſſed ſpirit.
                           Giue me good Lord a full faith, a firme hope, a feruent charitie, a loue to thee, good Lord, incomparable, aboue the loue of my ſelfe, that I may loue nothing to thy diſpleaſure, but euerie thing in a due order to thee. Giue me good Lord, a longing to be with thee, not for the auoiding of the calamities of this wretched world, nor ſo much for the auoiding of the paines of hell, neither ſo much for the obteining of the kingdome of heauen, in reſpect of mine owne commoditie: as euen for verie loue of thee. And beare me good Lord, thy loue & fauour, which thing my loue to thee-ward (were it neuer ſo gret) could not but of thy great goodnes deſerue. And pardon me good Lord, that am ſo bold to aſke thee ſo high petitions, being ſo vile and ſinfull a wretch, and ſo vnworthie to attaine the loweſt: but good Lord ſuch they be, as I am bound to deſire and wiſh, and ſhould be much neerer the effectuall deſire of them, if my manifold ſinnes were not the let, from which O glorious Trinitie, vouchſafe of thy goodneſſe to waſh me, with that bleſſed bloud that thou my ſweet ſauiour Ieſus Chriſt diddeſt ſhed out of thy bodie, in the diuers torments of thy moſt bitter paſſion, that by that ſame greeuous paſſion, glorious reſurrection and aſcenſion, I may come to that vnſpeakable ioie, the which thou haſt prepared for thy choſen and elect, through the ſame Ieſu Chriſt our ſauiour, to whome with the Father, and the holie Ghoſt, three perſons and one God, be all honour and glorie world without end: So be it.

                              O God, that art the ſtrength of ſuch as truſt in thee, mercifullie aſſiſt vs that call vpon thy name; and for aſmuch as mans infirmitie can

do nothing without thee, grant I moſt humblie beſeech thee, the help of thy ſpirit, that fulfilling thy commandements, both in will and deed, I may pleaſe thee, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord: So be it.

                              OH Lord bleſſe me and defend me, O Lord lift vp thy countenance ouer me, and be mercifull vnto me: O Lord lift vp thy countenance ouer me and giue me thy peace, that in thy peace, O Lord, I may depart, to amend my life, and doo vnto the poore as much as I can: giue me grace to be at vnitie, in quietneſſe, and in charitie with all thy choſen and elect people, and that thy feare, oh Lord, may euer reſt in my hart: So be it.
                           
                           Praiſe vnto God the Father, and peace vnto the liuing: As they that depart in thy faith, in thée doo reſt & haue their being.

                           EVENING PRAIER. ¶ A Confeſsion to be ſaid before Euening praier.
                           
                           
                              O Father of heauen, O ſonne of God redeemer of the world: O holie Ghoſt three perſons and one God; haue mercie vpon me moſt wretched caitife, and miſerable ſinner. I haue offended both heauen & earth, more than my tongue can expreſſe. My ſinnes (alas) are aboue all mens, both in number and greatneſſe, which I haue committed. Whither then may I go? Or whither ſhould I flie? To heauen I may be aſhamed to lift vp my face, and in earth I am not woorthie to find a place of refuge or ſuccour. To thee therefore, O Lord, doo I run; to thee doo I humble my ſelfe, ſaieng; O Lord my God, my ſinnes be great and innumerable:

but yet haue mercie vpon me for thy great mercie. The great myſterie that God became man, was not wrought for little or few offences. Thou didſt not giue thy ſonne, O heauenlie Father, vnto death for ſmall ſinnes onlie, but for all the greateſt ſinnes in the world: ſo that the ſinner returne vnto thee with his whole hart, as I doo here at this preſent. Wherefore haue mercie vpon me, O God, whoſe propertie is alwaie to haue mercie: wherefore haue mercie vpon me O Lord, for thy great mercie. I craue nothing, O Lord, for mine owne merits, but for thy name ſake, that it may be halowed therby, and for thy deere ſonne Ieſus Chriſts ſake, and now therefore: Our father of heauen halowed, &c.
                           
                        
                        
                           A praier to be ſaid in the Euening.
                           
                           
                              MOſt mercifull and heauenly father, I thanke thee by thy ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, that this day thou haſt giuen me all things needfull both for my ſoule and bodie, preſeruing me from all hurt and perill. I aſke thee mercie for mine offences, and I moſt humblie beſeech thee, that thou wilt likewiſe this night keepe me from ſinne and all euill, ſo that all my thoughts, my words & works may pleaſe thee. I doo commit my ſelfe both bodie and ſoule, and all that I go about, into thy hands. I beſeech thee that thy holie ſpirit may be with me, leaſt my deadlie aduerſarie haue anie power ouer me,
                           Amen.
                        
                        
                           Another Euening praier.
                           
                              O Souereigne, dreadfull, and moſt louing Lord my God, who neuer ceaſeſt to ſhew thy mercie towards ſinners, yea when they offend and treſpaſſe againſt thee, ſuch is thine infinite clemencie and loue. As then thou forbeareſt not

to heape thy benefits vpon them; I moſt ſinfull and wretched wretch, yeeld thee humble thanks, for thine ineſtimable goodneſſe ſhewed towards me, in creating me to thine owne likeneſſe, and making me capable of thine euerlaſting glorie: for the creation of ſo manie other creatures for my behoofe and ſuſtenance, for that ineſtimable worke of my redemption, whereby thou deliuereſt me from the ſlauerie of Sathan, and purchaſeſt mee free entrance into thy celeſtiall region: for hauing ſingled me amongſt ſo many millians that knowe thee not, and lie drowned in ignorance, ſuperſtition, and miſerable errours, to be thy ſeruant and a true faithfull Chriſtian: for both thy bleſſed Sacraments, eſpeciallie for that Sacrament aboue all Sacraments, wherein thou thy ſelfe art ſpirituallie conteined. Finallie, for hauing preſerued me ſo manie times from hell, wherein I had beene long ſince plunged, hadſt not thou of thine vnſpeakeable goodneſſe ſuſteined and deliuered me from my foes. For theſe and all other thy benefits: namelie, for thoſe thou haſt this daie moſt bountifullie beſtowed vpon me, O my ſouereigne Lord, I yeeld thee ſuch ſincere & dutifull thanks as my poore hart can poſſiblie affoord thee: beſeeching thee to haue mercie vpon me, & in ſupplie of my wants to accept the mediation and thankeſgiuings of Ieſus Chriſt thy onelie ſonne, and mine onelie Sauiour and interceſſour.
                           And now mine onlie redeemer and Sauiour I humblie craue the light of thy grace, to knowe wherein I haue this daie anie waies offended thee by nature; and that by ſound diſcuſſion, and through examination of my conſcience, I may ſee mine owne ſinnes with ſorrowe and deteſtation; and thine ineffable mercie with a zealous & firme purpoſe of amendment of life. Thou ſeeſt, O Lord, my lewdneſſe, and woteſt my miſerie, much better than I my ſelfe doo. Sorie I am with all

my hart, that I ſhould ſtill offend ſo louing a Lord, and wiſh to God my ſorowes were greatlie multiplied. I purpoſed earſt, to doo better by thy grace, which wanted not, & yet haue I tranſgreſſed in my former treſpaſſes: neither yet may I deſpaire, O Lord, but will continuallie truſt to thy mercies in all euents, & purpoſe firmelie, as I now doo, euerie daie to amend my life.
                           Deliuer me, my gratious God, from all mortall ſinne for euer, and giue me grace to perſecute my vices with ſorowe during life. And for the ſatiſfaction of theſe and all my former ſinnes, as alſo for all thine ineffable benefits beſtowed vpon me and all mankind; I offer vnto thee the merits of thy bitter paſſion, thoſe moſt pretious drops of bloud thou ſheddeſt for me; and that inflamed charitie, wherewith thou wholie reſignedſt thy ſelfe to all thy torments, for my ſake; and in the vnion of this thine oblation on the croſſe, I offer vp my ſelfe, ſoule, bodie, and all I haue of thine, within or without me, to thine honour and euerlaſting glorie. I retaine nothing to my ſelfe: but giue all to thee, whoſe it is; and make that thine by my will, which is thine of iuſtice. Giue me thy grace, O my God, to liue better herafter, and to confeſſe my ſinnes in due time vnto thee. Giue me true humilitie, continuall repentance, and grace both to knowe thee, and alſo my ſelfe. Giue me puritie of hart in all my dooings, patience, chaſtitie, and perfect charitie. Giue me a good life, and a good death, and in the dangerous houre of my departure, the aſſiſtance of thy bleſſed Saints and Angels, with whom I may, through thy mercie, in another world praiſe and glorifie thee euerlaſtinglie,
                           Amen.

                               Mercifull Lord and louing Father, without whoſe aid and motion, I am not able to ſtir one member toward heauenlie ſeruice, the burden of this ſlowe and ſinfull fleſh doth ſo ouercharge my weake ſoule. According to thy fatherlie pitie looke vpon me, O God, and quicken my dull ſpirit with thy grace, to riſe out of this mirie puddle, and to come before thy preſence in humble repentance, crauing thy mercie for my miſerable ſinnes and wickedneſſe, that being releaſed in the bloud and righteouſneſſe of Ieſus Chriſt, I may ioifullie ſerue, honour, and praiſe thine eternall Maieſtie, through thy deere ſonne my mercifull Lord and redeemer, to whom with thee and the holie Ghoſt, be all glorie and thanks for euer,
                           Amen.

                              PRaiſed be God for his excéeding fauour,
                              Wich hath giuen vs his ſonne to be our Sauiour,
                              We are ſinners, vnrighteous, fooliſh, and fleſhlie,
                              Chriſt is our mercie-ſtoole, righteouſneſſe, & wiſdome verelie.
                              
                                 
We are vncleane, holden vnder the danger of deth & ſins exaction,
                              Chriſt is our holines, our life, our redemption and ſatiſfaction.
                              Glorie be to thée, O Lord, borne of the vndefiled virgin,
                              Glorie be to the Father, and to the holie Ghoſt, our ſoules ſurgin: So be it.

                           The firſt Pſalme at Euening praier.
                           
                           
                              BOw downe thine eare, O Lord, to my requeſts, and ſuffer me to exhibit my ſupplication vp vnto thee. For behold, night and daie I trace and hunt after thee by all meanes I can. To thee onelie earlie and late doo I ſtill call and crie for mercie, according as thou haſt giuen mee in commandement.
                           For when I call to memorie the time of my life euill diſpent, I quake to thinke vpon thee, yea and my ſpirit faileth me, ſo ſore am I afraid of thy iudgements.
                           Yet well pondering the proceſſe of thy grace & mercie promiſed me in Chriſt, I ceaſe to deſpaire, knowing that thou, O GOD, haſt not forgotten thy gifts of grace, and that thy power to haue compaſſion is not waxen faint, but that both thou canſt and wilt put backe thy wrath moſt iuſtlie conceiued againſt me for my ſinne.
                           
                              
In full truſt whereof O Lord I come vnto thee, beſeeching thee to hide my life with Chriſt within thee, and vnder the ſhadowes of thy wings to defend me, that thy grace & couenant may be with me euermore.
                           Turne not thy mercie from me O Lord, nor bring me downe to deſtruction as I haue deſerued: but ſhew thy grace and fauour vnto me, that I may liue, and (being exalted through thy righteouſneſſe) praiſe thy name moſt ioifullie.
                           Remember my corrupt nature O Lord, how ſhort my life is, and that thou madeſt not man for nothing. No man can deliuer himſelfe from death: no man can ſaue his owne ſoule from hell: thou onelie O Lord muſt do it, namelie, to ſuch as beleeue in thee.
                           This life paſſeth as doth a dreame, or graſſe in the field, which to daie is greene, and to morrow drie. If thou be diſpleaſed, then we be loſt: if thou chafe, then we ſhrinke for feare, for through ſinnes we be dead vnto thee; with whome a thouſand yeares be but as one daie, yea as the leaſt minute of an houre.
                           Certeſſe Lord, if thou haue reſpect to our ſins, who ſhall continue? Shew me therefore how manie be the daies of my life, that I may diſpend them wiſelie, to the praiſe of thy name, leaſt that I fooliſhlie truſting vpon long life, ſuddenlie might periſh & come to death.
                           Come Lord now vnto vs, and comfort vs. Come O God, and hide not thy face from me, that I be not like vnto thoſe that be hurled into the pit of perdition. And after this night of calamitie ouerpaſſed, let the pleaſant morning of comfort luckilie ſhine vpon me, that betimes I may heare and feele thy goodneſſe, for in thee is all my truſt.
                           Deliuer me this night from the ſnare of Sathans gard, which hunt in the darke how to plucke me from thee.
                           Let me not ſtand in the feare of the night-euill of

vnbeleefe, and of thy ſtrait iudgement, neither let me be afraid of the fleeing arrowe in the daie time.
                           Let me not be in feare of that horrible peſtilence, creeping in through darkeneſſe, I meane, let me not be ignorant how deteſtable my ſins be, that I diſſemble them not, nor qualifie them.
                           Let me not dread that middaie diuell, which abuſeth thy Church vnder a title and pretence of holineſſe; neither let Sathan, though he change himſelfe into an Angel of light, ſtrike anie feare in me.
                           But both on the right ſide and on the left, as well in the night as in the daie, that is, as well in aduerſitie as proſperitie, and as well in ſpirituall buſineſſe, as in corporall, let thy holie Angels diligentlie wait vpon me, that I do not ſtumble: then ſhall I tread vnderfoot that hellie dragon.
                           Yea ſo ſhall I of dutie be bound alwaie with couragious ſpirit, to praiſe and hallowe thy name: not onlie in the morrowe, when all things ſhall chance to my harts deſire, to aſcribe all to thy goodneſſe, without anie deſeruing on my behalfe: but alſo in the night of trouble and aduerſitie, when I ſhall call vnto mind thy moſt faithfull and truſtie promiſes, that I deſpaire not, thus to praiſe thy meere and ſpeciall grace, and bleſſe thee, ſaieng:
                           Bleſſed art thou O Lord God of our fathers, for thou art praiſe and honour, worthie, and to be magnified for euer.
                           Bleſſed be the glorie of thy holie name, for it is worthie to be praiſed, & aboue all to be magnified for euer.
                           Bleſſed art thou, O father, O Sonne, and O holie Ghoſt, for thou art worthie to be praiſed, and aboue all to be magnified for euer.
                           Bleſſed be thou in the firmament of heauen, for thou art praiſe-worthie for euer.
                           O giue thanks vnto the Lord all his creatures, for

he is kind-harted and mercifull: yea his mercie endureth for euer.
                           Oh ſpeake good of the Lord all ye works of his in all places of his dominion: and let euerie thing that hath breath praiſe the Lord, and giue him thanks: for his mercie endureth for euer.
                           O that all men would therefore praiſe the Lord for his goodneſſe, and declare the wonders that he doth for the children of men!
                           Praiſe thou the Lord O my ſoule, and forget not all his benefits, yea and all that is within me praiſe his holie name, for his louing mercie and for his truth, which endureth for euer, & worlds without end,
                           Amen.
                           Glorie be to the father, &c. As it was in the begin, &c.
                        
                        
                           The ſecond Pſalme.
                           
                              MY God, my God remember me, forſake me not, ſuffer me not to be loſt, ſith both night and daie I crie to thee, heare me my Lord.
                           Our fathers truſted in thee, and thou helpedſt them, whenſoeuer they called vpon thee, at no tune thou failedſt them, but waſt alwaies at hand to aſſiſt them.
                           Come foorth father moſt deerelie beloued in my hart, reſtore me from Sathans kingdome.
                           Thou dreweſt me foorth of my mothers wombe, and haſt preſerued me vnto this daie.
                           Of thy benignitie and mercie (which I beſeech thee denie me not at this my neede) go not awaie from me, for anguiſh and penſiueneſſe of hart drawe nigh vnto me, and yet is there none that can helpe me, but thou onlie.
                           Let me eſcape from theſe dangers through thy Chriſt my ſauiour, who for my ſake hath ſuffered ſo ſpitefull and bitter paines, who for me was ſore vexed, cruellie

ſcourged, wounded, nailed, and hanged on the croſſe.
                           Let me eſcape I ſaie for his bloud ſake, which he ſo largelie ſhed for vs, to cauſe vs obteine forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes, and enioie the new and euerlaſting couenant made betwixt thee and vs.
                           Stand not farre from me O Lord my refuge and ſtrength: come neere and helpe me, deliuer my life from the ſword, and my ſoule from the wood dogs, from the Lions iawes reſtore me, betweene the hornes of the Unicornes heare thou me.
                           Then ſhall I blowe abroade thy name with all praiſes vnto my brethren, and in the aſſemblie of the holie perſons I ſhall commend thee.
                           Deſpiſe not the praiers of the poore, turne not awaie thy face, heare my crie, for I will record this thy goodneſſe among the miſerable, painefull, and troubleſome conſciences, that they thereof may take hart of comfort, growe in hope, cleaue more feruentlie vnto thee, blowe abroade thy moſt glorious name, and giue thee euerlaſting thanks for their ſaluation,
                           Amen.
                           Glorie be to the father, &c. As it was in the beginning, &c.
                        
                        
                           The third Pſalme.
                           
                              OUT of the furtheſt angles of the earth on euerie ſide, thou ſhalt with a mightie voice call men to iudgement Lord God omnipotent, to whome nothing is hid.
                           Open our eares that we may heare this thy promiſe: I ſhall be your God.
                           
                           In thee conſtantlie beleeue we, with thy foiſon we be filled.
                           Prudentlie thou doſt declare and teſtifie, that of our goods and ſacrifices thou haſt no need, and doeſt not either regard or meaſure them: for all be thine, and in thee it lieth to make the things we now poſſeſſe to be

ours, or not ours.
                           Thou onlie requireſt ſacrifices of thanke ſgiuing: let vs therefore diſcloſe the bottome of our harts to thee: let vs knowledge thee to be our God.
                           Let vs halowe thy name in all things, flowe in thy word, render thanks both in weale and wo, require thy ſuccours in ſtraits and neceſſities, in which time thou haſt promiſed to helpe vs: then ſhall we, ſo deliuered, blaſe thy name.
                           Lord God moſt iuſt, true of promiſe, and deereſt Father: thee beſeech I to ſend ſuccours vnto me euen of thine infinite goodneſſe.
                           For thy renowmes ſake, for Ieſus Chriſts ſake thy beloued ſonne, and for his pretious bloud largelie ſhed for vs on the croſſe, haue mercie vpon me, ſo that once purged I may come againe in fauour with thee.
                           Pitie me, heare me out of the ſtraits of this ſinfull fleſh, wherewith on euerie ſide I am hampered in.
                           Set me at large againe, rid me from mine enimies, which ſeeke to drawe me awaie from thy true ſeruice.
                           In thy comfort let me reioice, and be full of ſpirituall ioie: let me euer brute thy name, not vnmindfull of thy benefits.
                           Releeue me moſt pitifull God, according to thy word, which is the truth.
                           Moſt tender father, ſhew me that thy ioifull health.
                           Glorie be to the Father, &c. As it was in the begin, &c.
                        
                        
                           The fourth Pſalme.
                           
                              THy clemencie and bleſſing moſt mightie God we craue, and require of thee full inſtantlie.
                           Let thy countenance ſhine vpon vs, haue compaſſion vpon vs, that here in earth wee may find out the waie which leadeth vnto thee, and may attaine thy ſaluation among the Gentils.
                           O that all people would confeſſe thee with louing

harts for thy manifold benefits and pleaſures, which they haue receiued at thy hands, who doſt with iuſtice gouerne men, and art their leader vpon earth!
                           Powre downe Lord thy goodneſſe, and continuall bleſſings vpon vs, and then ſhall the earth yeeld vnto thee glorie and praiſe, and to vs fruits for meate.
                           Thou God the father bleſſe vs, thou God the ſonne bleſſe vs, and thou God the holie Ghoſt bleſſe vs: yea thou holie, bleſſed, and glorious Trinitie, grant vs thy continuall bleſſing.
                           O that all the coaſts of the earth (Lord God) would feare and ſtand in awe of thee!
                           Would God that we alſo might ſtudie to worke no man either pleaſure or diſpleaſure that ſhould be againſt thy will; but that we may doo all things according to thy commandements!
                           Glorie be to the father, &c. As it was in the begin, &c.
                        
                        
                           A contemplation and praier exclaming of the carefull paſsions of the ſoule and bodie.
                           
                              WO is me carefull carcaſe and filthie defiled fleſh, conceiued and borne in ſinne, depriued of originall iuſtice, compared to a beaſt, in Adam fallen as a rotten apple from a liuing tree. What haue I gotten by my fall? Darknes, care, miſerie, affliction, ſickneſſe, paine, anguiſh, and finallie dreadfull death. And alas, what ſhall I be hereafter? A ſtinking carion, woormes meate, foode for fire, duſt and claie, doong and forſaken, rotten & conſumed, blind, poore and naked, troden vnder the feete of my poſteritie, and forgotten of all men, not knowing where my bodie is, which ſhall vaniſh like a ſhadowe, and my life ſhall wither like a leafe, and fade as a flower.
                           O holie God, the more our bodies doo increaſe, the neerer death doth approch, the clocke of our conſcience

doth ring euerie minute, the houre of death to be at hand. Death approcheth with his ſharpe dart and bloudie chariot: Awaie (ſaith he) to euerie liuing wight. For what is he that ſhall not ſee death, and come to nothing? Oh vncertaine life; but moſt aſſured death! His net is caſt ouer all fleſh: now I doo reioice, then I lament: now am I whole, then ſickneſſe doth come: now haue I friends, then am I forſaken: now at libertie, ſoone after in bondage: now yoong, then age drawes neere. And thus I neuer remaine in one ſtate: made light and proud in proſperitie, deſperate in aduerſitie, withered and old with care, deſpiſed in pouertie, flattered when I am in health; and finally vncertaine when or where I ſhall die. But yet I moſt humblie praie thee deere father, for Ieſu Chriſts ſake, which ſuffered a ſhamefull death for my ſins, to haue mercie vpon me, according to thy great mercie, and take not thy holie Ghoſt from me, and lead me not into temptation, but deliuer me: for into thy hands I commend my ſoule, O thou God of truth,
                           Amen.
                        
                        
                           An Hymne of the ſtate of all Adams posteritie.
                           
                           I Am the fruit of Adams hands, through ſin lockt in ſatans bands, Deſtined to deth, the child of ire, a flaming brand of infernall fire: Borne I was naked & bare, and ſpend my time in ſorowe & care, And ſhall returne vnto the duſt, and be depriued of carnall luſt. Yet thou father didſt Ieſus ſend, to pardon them that did offend: We laud him in the work of might, that we be bleſſed in his ſight.
                        
                        
                           The ſecond meditation of the dreadfull daie of iudgement.
                           
                           
                              
                                 O
                               What feare and ſorowe ſhall happen to the reprobates, when they ſhall ſtand helpeleſſe before the terrible & dreadfull throne of God, to render accounts of all thoughts, words & works, I ſaie, the acts of the fleſh and bloud, in the extreame

day, when he ſhall come with fire; and then all creatures in heauen, earth and hell, ſhall tremble at his preſence. Then ſhall all guiltie conſciences be opened, & euils endleſſe puniſhed, where that Iudge will not be corrupted. That daie doth come; that daie is at hand, and where as pure harts ſhall be accepted, and no bribes of vaine gifts ſhall be preferred, but iuſtice without mercie vnto the vngodlie, infernall torments to the wicked, endleſſe care and affliction to the idolater, fornicator, extortioner, perſecutour, diſobedient, murtherer, blaſphemer, theefe, falſe witneſſe bearer, vſurer, heretikes, witches and malefactors, and to all the veſſels of reprobation. Where as ſhall be heard wailing, crieng, lamenting and gnaſhing of teeth: then they mourne that ſhall neuer die: hell fire neuer bee quenched, nor the Iudge intreated; but the wicked ſtill moleſted with dolor, agonie, dread, and in his paine abſent from God, preſent with diuels & monſters infernall. This is the ſecond death when both bodie and ſoule ſhall remaine in paine, as long as God is, which is euerlaſting. This daie is at hand, when the elect and all the Saints, Patriarchs, Prophets, Martyrs and all the bleſſed ſhall receiue their rewards, not of themſelues, but onlie of Ieſu, before whom all the bleſſed ſhall kneele and caſt off their crownes, and giue honour to him that ſits on the ſeate, whoſe holie name is bleſſed of all tongues and kindreds: Amen, Amen. This is the daie, when all teares ſhall be wiped from the carefull eies of the ſeruants of God, which ſhall neuer be moleſted, nor of worldlings be afflicted, but euerlaſtinglie glorified, with the Father, the Sonne, and the holie Ghoſt, three perſons and one God, who of his mercie defend vs from damnation, and that vnſpeakeable paine, which wee through ſinne haue deſerued, euer to be puniſhed withall: but yet are through Ieſus preſerued, by whome we are elected, redeemed,

iuſtified, and brought from ſinne, death and hell: to whom be laud and praiſe, in the world of worlds, of Angels and men:
                           Amen.
                        
                        
                           The Hymne of the daie of iudgement.
                           
                           
                              SWéet Ieſus of thy mercie, our pitifull praiers heare:
                              That we may be on thy right hand, when thou ſhalt appeare.
                              For thou ſhalt come with heauenlie power, and ſit on the throne:
                              None ſhall iudge the quicke and dead, but thou Chriſt alone.
                              O Chriſt caſt vs not awaie, in that daie of ire:
                              When thou ſhalt ſend before thée, a hot conſuming fire.
                              To purge all creatures, defild with Adams ſinne:
                              Then a new heauen and earth, O Lord thou wilt beginne.
                              Then the elect ſhall be bleſſed, vpon thy holie hill:
                              But the wicked ſhall be damned, that haue withſtood thy will.
                              Thy ſhéepe ſhall be ſafe, and defended in the fold:
                              The goats ſhall wander, in hunger, ſtorme and cold.
                              Thy Saints ſhall behold thée, in thy throne of light:
                              The reprobates ſhall euer, haue fearefull things in ſight.
                              Wailing in wretchedneſſe, with euerlaſting paine:
                              Yet Lord be mercifull, our liues are but vaine.
                              Our fleſh ſhall fade, death hath digd our graue:
                              Yet of thy mercie Lord, thy ſinfull creature ſaue.
                              And bleſſe vs in the time of grace, before the daie of ire:
                              When the corrupt elements, ſhall be purgd with fire.
                              We laud thee Father, &c.
                           
                        
                        
                           A generall praier, wherein we commend our ſelues, and the whole ſtate of Christs Church vnto GOD.
                           
                              
                                 O
                               God thou Father and God of my life, ſuffer me neither to haue a proud looke, nor a proud thought; turne awaie all voluptuouſneſſe from me: let not the intiſements of the world

beguile me; let not the concupiſcence of the eie deceiue me; let not the luſts of the fleſh take hold vpon me; let not rancor and malice reigne in my hart. O Lord God, for thy ſonne our Sauiour Ieſu Chriſts ſake, I beſeech thee, that thou wilt not giue me ouer to an vnſhamefaſt and obſtinate mind: So be it.
                           
                           Unto thee Lord almightie, the King of mercie, bée now and euer eternall honour & glorie. Unto thee the ſame Lord of mercie I doo commit my ſoule and bodie, moſt humblie beſeeching thee, for thine abundant mercie ſake, to take the cure of me, and to haue mercie on me. I doo commit alſo vnto thy mercie my faithfull friends and well-willers liuing, beſeeching thee to forgiue vs all, and to haue mercie vpon vs, and giue vs grace to liue according to thy lawe, and to the glorie of thy name, that we may doo that, which thou requireſt of vs, that it will pleaſe thee of thy mercie, to ſaue and defend vs from all perils, bodilie & ghoſtlie this night and euer, and eſpeciallie all things that ſhall turne to thy diſpleaſure. And with all my hart I thanke thee moſt mercifull Lord, for the great benefits that thou haſt beſtowed vpon me largelie in this world, afore manie creatures, which are more woorthie a thouſand times than I: but my moſt gratious Lord, I wot and knowledge verelie, that all good gifts doo come freelie from thee, of thine abundant mercie. Wherefore with all my hart I thanke thee, and all worſhip, praiſes and thanks be to thee and none other. Therefore I ſaie with the Prophet Dauid: Not vnto vs, Lord, not vnto vs: but vnto thy name be giuen all honour & glorie.
                           Alſo I commit to thy mercie mine enimies, perſecutors and ſlanderers, beſeeching thee to turne their harts, and to giue vs grace one to forgiue another from the verie botome of our harts, that from hence-foorth we may liue in loue and charitie, to thy glorie, and to the increaſe of thy kingdome.
                           
                              
I doo commit to thy mercie our Queene Elizabeth, and this Realme, beſeeching thee to incline hir hart to all godlineſſe and vertue, that ſhe may long reigne ouer vs in peace and tranquillitie, to liue in thy feare, and call vpon thy holie name, and to be readie at all times to ſet foorth thy bleſſed lawes and commandements: and that thou O omnipotent God, with thy mightie hand and ſtretched out arme, wilt confound all Idolatrie and ſuperſtition, and ſet vp thy true and holie religion, that thy faithfull ſeruants may triumph and reioice in thee with merie harts, and ſing vnto thy praiſe, that this the mightie hand of GOD hath brought to paſſe, and to thy name giue the honour and glorie, to whome all honour and glorie is due.
                           I doo commit vnto thy mercie, all thoſe that in this tranſitorie life be in ſorowe, ſickneſſe, neede, tribulation, or anie other aduerſitie, and ſpeciallie all thoſe that for the profeſſion of thy Goſpell, and the defence of the ſaine, doo put their liues vnto the edge of the ſword. O Lord for thy mercies ſake, forgiue them and vs our offences paſt, comfort them in their greeuous afflictions, ſtrengthen them in their weakeneſſe, ſend them patience in their tribulations, abate the pride of their and our enimies, aſſwage the malice of them, confound their wicked deuiſes, that we and they being armed with thy mightie defence, may be preſerued euermore from perils, to glorifie thee, which art the onlie giuer of all victorie, through ye merits of Chriſt: So be it.
                           
                           I commit to thy mercie all thoſe that doo faithfullie profeſſe thy holie Goſpell, beſeeching thee to giue vs grace to liue according to thy lawes, that by well dooing, we may ſtop the mouthes of the vngodlie aduerſaries of the Goſpell, and thereby win them to the right waie, that we may all with one hart, and one mouth, glorifie thee, O Lord God in the daie of viſitation, to whome all honour and glorie is due.
                           
                              
And now O my moſt mercifull Lord, and louing father, I finallie commit vnto thy mercie my wretched ſoule and bodie, humblie beſeeching thee to haue mercie vpon me, according to thy great bountifull mercie: and according to the multitude of thy tender compaſſions, doo awaie I beſeech thee my moſt greeuous iniquities.
                           Unto God the father, the ſonne and the holie Ghoſt, be now and euer eternall honour and glorie, world without end,

                              THe God of Angels and men, the founder of all creatures viſible and inuiſible, in whoſe hand is life and death, light and darkneſſe, and all the motions of ſoule and bodie, without whome there is no good gift, nor perfect quietneſſe of conſcience, but onlie vanitie and vexation of mind, and vtter confuſion of ſoule and bodie, and finall torments in the horrible pit of darkneſſe: now my Lord God, darkneſſe doth approch, this daie hath loſt his beautie, I as vnworthie of thy benefits, moſt humblie praie thee this night to bleſſe me, and with thy holie Angels aſſiſt me, thy holie ſpirit this night lighten me, which haſt of earth made me, and by thy creatures doeſt nouriſh me, and with thy bloud haſt conſecrated me with thee to dwell eternallie in glorie, when death hath diſſolued me, which am but vanitie, &c. And baniſh Sathan from me, that neither mine owne conſcience now vexe me, nor mine old offences trouble me. I moſt humblie beſeech thee this night to pardon me, which haue ſore offended thee, in thought, word and deede, againſt thy diuine maieſtie, which ſore repenteth me. Saue me good Lord this night ſleeping, from

dreadfull dreames, and painefull ſlumber deliuer me, that I may awake in Chriſt, and reſt in peace: So be it.

                           AL mightie God, and moſt mercifull father, the fountaine of all felicitie, from whom onelie proceedeth all good gifts, moſt humblie I beſeech thee of thine abundant mercie & exceeding kindneſſe, ſo to direct and gouern me this daie and euer with thy good guiding Spirit, that all my thoughts, words and deeds, may onelie be occupied in thy ſeruice, faith, feare and loue, and ſo aſſiſt and ſtrengthen me with thy grace, O moſt mercifull and louing father, for thy ſonne Ieſus Chriſt his ſake, that neither ſinne, death, hell, nor Sathan haue the dominion and vpper hand of me. Indue my hart with the true vnderſtanding of thy true and liuelie word, that I may be readie and prone manfullie to fight vnder the ſtandard of my glorious captaine Ieſus Chriſt

againſt the world, the fleſh, and that cruell Serpent the old Leuiathan, which hunteth continuallie, like a roring Lion, ſeeking the vtter deſtruction of my ſoule.
                        Make me conſtant in time of temptation, that when or at what time my rebelling and ſinfull fleſh ſhall intiſe me, to luſt after the pompes and vanities of this wicked world, I may by a ſtrong, liuelie, and vnſpeakable faith, through the bitter torments that my Sauiour Chriſt Ieſus ſuffered for me, and all that faithfullie beleeue and call vpon him; ſo mortifie and ſubdue the old Adam, that I may be dead and buried from ſinne and all iniquitie; and the new man Chriſt Ieſus may continuallie dwell and reigne in me, by whoſe meanes I ſhall be garniſhed and decked, by the means of a fruitfull faith, with immortalitie, and heauenlie bleſſedneſſe.
                        Uouchſafe, O Lord, I beſeech thee, according to the multitude of thy mercies to looke vpon me, and by thy celeſtiall prouidence, ſo illuminate the eies of my ſoule, that I may continuallie watch for the glorious comming of thine annointed ſon Ieſus Chriſt. Roote out, O Lord, in and from me the vile and corrupt branches of rapine, deceit, auarice, luxurie, concupiſcence, and all vngodlineſſe, let the motions of my mind altogether depend vpon thee, prepare my tongue to publiſh thy praiſe; let my lips be locked vp from all ſcurillitie and vncomlie talke: let mine eares loath and abhor to heare thy glorious and bleſſed name blaſphemed, and thy truth to be by anie Sectarian ill ſpoken of, & ſlandered: keepe and defend me vnder the wings of thy comfortable protection, from all errours, ſchiſmes, and deteſtable hereſies. Make me without faining, firmelie and conſtantlie to build vpon the truth, wherein is perfectlie ſet forth thy great mercie and diuine iuſtice. Let the zeale of thy promiſes in all diſtres be my chiefeſt ioie and conſolation, & giue me grace from aboue,

that as I make my boaſt of thy mercies and louing kindneſſe, by vertue whereof I am by my Sauiour Chriſt Ieſus quickened from death to life, and in his deereſt death and pretious bloud-ſhedding regenerated, and borne anew, not of water, but of the ſpirit by faith.
                        So Lord, I may with thine abundant loue ſhewed to me ward, and the whole poſteritie of Adam, I may be afraid wilfullie, or of a ſet purpoſe to tranſgreſſe thy commandements, and ſo incur therby thy diſpleaſure, that the effects of thy iuſtice in the day of thy comming to iudgement, be pronounced againſt me to the vtter deſtruction of bodie and ſoule. Make me alwaies willing, good Lord, to heare thy word, by the power wherof my faith is increaſed, and there withall plant in me perfect loue and obedience, and ſo direct my footeſteps in this vale of miſerie, that I may tread the path that leadeth to thee, with whom my ſoule thirſteth to reſt, euen as vehementlie as the Hart longeth after the water brookes. Grant this, O mercifull God, for the honour and glorie of thy name ſake,

ſcourged in thy diuine preſence, who thereby doth mitigate thy wrath and indignation, iuſtlie conceiued againſt me a miſerable and wretched creature, and all mankind.
                        Make me Lord ſtill to confeſſe mine vnwoorthineſſe, and weakneſſe to be ſuch and ſo great, that of my ſelfe I am not worthie to lift vp mine eies to heauen, much leſſe to be called thy ſonne, or handmaiden, ſuch and ſo great is the burden of my ſinne & iniquitie, ſo that by the meanes of my corruption & filthineſſe, I acknowledge my ſelfe to be the child of death and deſtruction, yet build I ſtill on thy promiſes, good Lord, and in this great danger I come vnto thee with teares, ſaieng:
                        O Father, I haue ſinned againſt heauen, & againſt thee, and am no more woorthie to be called thy child. Of my ſelfe I haue nothing; but by thee I haue althings: of my ſelfe I acknowledge I haue iuſtlie deſerued the heauie ſentence of thine ire; but by grace of thee, O mightie Emanuel, I am regenerate, and borne againe from death to life; from danger to ioie; from perill to peace; from bondage to libertie, and ſo in fine, from hell and damnation, to bliſſe and ſaluation.
                        Such is the effect of thy mercie, ſo abundant is thy loue towards me, & all thoſe that with contrite harts preſent themſelues vnto thee. Increaſe my faith Lord, that it may abound in good and fruitfull works: ſo fortifie me, that I neuer ſwarue from thy veritie: giue me thy grace from aboue, O mercifull Ieſu, that I may neuer ſhrinke from thy ſacred teſtimonies.
                        And moreouer, I with all humilitie and reuerence of hart and mind, beſeech thee this night, which thou haſt ordeined for man to reſt in, that thou wilt gard and protect me with thy good guiding ſpirit. And albeit my ſinfull fleſh ſhall ſleepe and ſlumber, yet grant, good Lord, that my ſoule may continually keepe watch and ward: let not the enunie find me ſlumbering & ſleeping,

as careleſſe, in the cradle of ſinfull ſecuritie, leaſt that whileſt I am vnarmed, that is, naked and deſtitute of thy grace and fauour, he enter in and breake vp the houſe of my ſinfull bodie, and make ſuch hauocke and ſpoile, that mine infected and leporous ſoule, deformed by meanes of mine iniquitie, and wounded with the dangerous darts of tranſgreſſion, be thrown with the bodie of ſinne into the lake of deſtruction, wherein is continuall wailing, and gnaſhing of teeth.
                        Make me ſtill, O good Lord, to conſider, that the bed is a plaine patterne and ſimilitude of the graue, which continuallie calleth for me, & all other thy creatures. Make me to vnderſtand, that when I am laid, (of my ſelfe) without thy heauenlie prouidence I can not bee able to riſe againe. Make me to acknowledge that ſleepe is the verie figure of death, to whoſe ſtroke, at thine appointed pleaſure, I muſt ſubmit my ſelfe. Indue me with loue and charitie to all men, let my lampe O Lord be garniſhed with oile, that whenſoeuer, or at what time ſoeuer thy meſſenger death ſhall drawe me, and knocke at the gates of my houſe, I may at his ſummons, in the daie of the reſurrection of the dead, be readie to attend on thee and thy bride, with my burning lampe, that is, with a ſtedfaſt faith, when as by thee I ſhall be cloathed anew. For my mortall bodie ſhall then be couered with immortalitie; the corruption of my ſinfull and rebelling fleſh ſhall be changed to incorruption and perfect puritie: thy righteouſneſſe ſhall be mine; thy merits ſhall make me perfect and holie, by vertue whereof, hell ſhall looſe his victorie; death ſhall looſe his ſting; my faith and hope ſhall haue end and reward, and I with thy Saints continuallie dwell in loue & charitie with thee, the heauenlie bridegroome, Chriſt Ieſus: to whom with the father, and the holie Ghoſt, bee aſcribed all laud, glorie, power, praiſe and dominion, for euer:
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        
                        A praier for the remiſſion of ſinne, and to obteine a vertuous life.
                        
                        
                           FOraſmuch as (O bountifull Lord) it is moſt meet, right and iuſt, that all fleſh ſhuld praiſe, magnifie, and worſhip thee, and ſhould without ceaſing giue thanks vnto thee, who onlie art the Creator and maker of all things, as well viſible as inuiſible; who onlie art the treaſure of all goodneſſe, and well of life, onlie God and Lord, whome the heauens, and heauen of heauens, the ſunne, the moone, the ſtarres, the earth, the ſea, with all that moue therin, yea the heauenlie companie of Martyrs, the ſoules of the Prophets and Apoſtles, Angels, Archangels, togither with the ſoules of all iuſt and righteous perſons doo laud and glorifie.
                        It is moſt requiſite, that ech mortall creature liuing in this world, ſhould alſo acknowledge thy magnificence. Wherfore, moſt mercifull father, I with my hart and mouth doo acknowledge thee to be my King and Lord, the giuer of all goodneſſe: I confeſſe thee to be omnipotent, reuerend, merciful, long ſuffering, God of all conſolation, comfort, mercie and pitie.
                        I knowe that of thine infinite goodneſſe onelie thou diddeſt make man after thy ſimilitude and likeneſſe, placing him in the moſt delectable place of Paradyſe. And although he did tranſgreſſe thy commandement, and thereby deſerued eternall death and damnation: yet thou, like a moſt louing and pitifull Father, diddeſt not vtterlie reiect him, but gentlie correct him, and after that thou hadſt ſent him into the earth, commanding him there to increaſe and multiplie, thou didſt inſtruct his poſteritie with thy lawe; thou didſt teach them by thy Prophets, and after that ſenteſt downe thine onlie begotten ſonne to take vpon him our nature, and to ſuffer death for our ſinnes, therby to make

a recompenſe for the offence which man had committed againſt thee: and all this thou didſt of thine exceeding great mercie and kindneſſe, without anie deſert of mankind, not being ſo much as by anie one praier, or yet intreatie therevnto incited.
                        Therefore I being boldened with ſuch ineſtimable benefits, ſo freelie giuen and beſtowed, doo without any feare at this time, appere before thy diuine Maieſtie, proſtrating my ſlefe before the ſeate of thy mercie, and with all humbleneſſe of hart and mind doo make this my praier vnto thee.
                        Deſpiſe me not (O Lord God) being defiled with ſin and iniquitie. For behold, I preſent my ſelfe before thee, not preſuming vpon mine owne woorthineſſe, but truſting in thy goodneſſe.
                        Be mercifull vnto me a ſinner: light thou the dull ſighted eies of my mind, open thou the ſtopped eares of mine hart, that I may both ſee, heare, perceiue and vnderſtand that, which thou teacheſt, and alwaies doo that, which thou commandeſt. Make me not onelie a hearer of thy heauenlie doctrine; but alſo a perfect folower of the ſame: direct, ſanctifie and gouerne my life: be thou alwaies preſent and readie, both to heare, and to helpe me. Saue and defend me from all ſhame and reproch: be thou my ſhield & buckler againſt all temptations; clenſe my mind and thought from all vncleanneſſe; keepe and preſerue me from all danger both of bodie and ſoule. This fraile life is nothing elſe but a continuall warfare in this world: our ſinnes moſt like to cruell enimies, aſſault vs on euerie ſide: againe our daies are but few in number.
                        Guide me therefore with thy grace, ſo to ſpend my ſmall, ſhort and tranſitorie time in this world, the verie fountaine, welſpring, and vale of all miſerie, that I may be made a member of Chriſt, & partaker of thine eternall felicitie. To the which, ſeeing that through

mine owne deſert, I ſhall neuer be able to aſpire, (for ſinne trulie ſo aboundeth in me, that ech deed and act of mine, is not onelie infected, but altogither polluted therwith) none other remedie haue I to eaſe my ſelfe: none other ſalue to heale my ſore, but onelie to take hold of that promiſe of thine wheras thou ſaieſt: Come vnto me all ye that ye that labour, and be ouerladen, and I will refreſh you.
                        This is my hold-faſt; this is mine anchor and ſure ſtaie. For verelie (ſweet Sauiour) when I looke vpon mine owne frailneſſe, and behold how readie I am to offend thee; then I quake for feare, then I am almoſt in vtter deſpaire: but as ſoone as I call to mind thy great loue and kindneſſe, and how that thou wilt not the death of a ſinner, but rather that he ſhould repent and liue, and that in what daie ſoeuer he doth hartilie repent and call vnto thee, thou wilt heare him: then I am releeued; then I am not a little comforted, knowing ſurelie that thou wilt performe that which thou haſt promiſed, in faithfull aſſurance whereof, I now ſaie vnto thee:
                        Turne thou me, O my God, and I ſhall be turned: from all my wickedneſſe deliuer me. Heale my ſoule, which is wounded with ſinne: for I doo acknowledge mine iniquitie, and am hartilie ſorie for mine offences: correct me, O Lord, but yet not in thy furie, looke not vpon my weakneſſe; but thinke vpon thine owne worthineſſe: remember thy louing kindneſſe, and in the abundance and multitude of thy mercies, wipe cleane awaie, pardon and forget all my ſinnes, through which I haue either in word, deede or though, or anie other kind of way offended thee, blot them out of thy remembrance, and let the bloud of that immaculate lambe Ieſus Chriſt, waſh them awaie: let mine old offences ſo decaie and die in me, that I neuer commit them any more, or by anie meanes renew them in thy ſight.
                        
                           
And in the meane time doo not withdrawe thy grace from me, but cauſe me to doo all that which good is. O Father, remoue thy wrath awaie from me, and reſtore vnto me thy fauour: turne thou thy louing countenance vnto me, and plentifullie powre foorth thy mercie vpon me. Incline my hart to doo that onelie, which is acceptable in thy ſight: guide thou my footeſteps in thy paths, and ſuffer me not at any time to ſtraie from thy waies: let me alwaies haue the feare of thee in my hart, and the remembrance of thy benefits freſh in my memorie: and if at anie time through weakeneſſe and failtie, I doo tranſgreſſe thy commandements, yet doo not therefore reiect and caſt me out of thy ſight; but be thou that good Samaritane, and powre the oile and wine of mercie and forgiueneſſe into thoſe wounds, which ſinne ſhall make in me. Diſdaine me not for my reuolting; but haue mercie vpon me, according to thy great goodneſſe, and according to the multitude of thy mercies wipe awaie mine iniquitie. Hide me vnder the ſhadowe of thy wings and protection: lighten mee with thy holie ſpirit. Make me thy ſeruant: ſo indue me with thy grace, that I may vnfeinedlie, with hart and voice, ſerue, honour, and praiſe thee all the daies of my life:
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another praier for the obteining of grace and mercie.
                        
                        
                           O Moſt mercifull Lord God, whoſe Maieſtie is incomprehenſible, & power infinite, whoſe magnificence is exalted aboue the heauens: vouchſafe, I beſeech thee, frō thy high throne to behold the worke of thy hands: haue pitie on the vnhappie and deſolate condition of thy creature. I am a ſinner, conceiued in ſinne, and of my ſelfe I haue no good thing: wherefore, O Lord, I cleaue to the altar of thy mercie. Thou art my anchor, my hope, my refuge

and ſtaie. Therefore O Lord, haue mercie vpon me, for no fleſh can be iuſtified in thy ſight. Thou knoweſt the frailtie and weakeneſſe of men. We are taught by the fall of Peter, that we can doo nothing without thee. Graunt vs therefore good Lord thy grace, without which in this world, we are like by the waues of temptations to be ſwallowed in the gulph and whirlepoole of ſinne: to be drowned as the ſhip without anchor and Pilote in euerie tempeſt, to runne on the rocke and periſh. Guide vs therefore by thy grace good Lord, through the flouds of this carefull world, that we may reſt for euer in the pleaſant port, and happie hauen of euerlaſting ioie, with thine elected, through our bleſſed Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt: to whome with thee and the holie Ghoſt, be all honour and glorie, in all worlds,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        A Confeſſion to be ſaid of the penitent perſon.
                        
                        
                           O Moſt mercifull Lord God, I haue offended againſt the throne of thy Maieſtie; my ſinnes are euer before mine eies: I am not worthie to liue or enioie the fruits wherewith thou haſt bleſſed the earth. Mine owne conſcience is my tormenter, bringing teſtimonie and witneſſe againſt me. The Sunne doth hide his light againſt me, and the place is the woorſſe wherein I become. O Lord what ſhall I doo? Shall I deſpaire? No, thou art mercifull, and more readie to forgiue, than we to aſke. I will confeſſe my ſinnes to thee. I am wearie of my ſinfull life. I am ſorie in my ſoule for mine offences. Wherefore good Lord, thou which dooeſt eaſe them that are laden, and refreſh them that trauell: thou which haſt promiſed mercie to the penitent, looke on me thy ſeruant with thy cheerefull countenance: behold me with thoſe pitifull eies, with which thou didſt Marie Magdalen, and

the woman taken in adulterie. Thou which haſt ſhed thy bloud ou the altar of the Croſſe, offering thy moſt pretious bodie an eternall ſacrifice for our ſinnes: deſpiſe not that which thou haſt redeemed. Thou which cammeſt into the world to call ſinners to repentance, and to ſaue the loſt ſheepe of Iſrael, haue mercie vpon me, and leade me by thy grace to the fold, amóng thy ſheepe, for they go in ſweet paſture, and are not in danger of Wolues, for thou art their ſhepheard, and keepeſt good accompt of euerie one of them. Though I haue gone aſtraie, wandring from thy flocke, and borne the marks of the world: yet good Lord diſclaime not thy right, I beſeech thee; but take me vnto thee, that I may be ſafe vnder the ſhadowe of thy wings. He may ſleepe ſoundlie whome thou dooeſt keepe. Thou art the watchman of Iſrael. All honour and glorie be vnto thee for euer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another godlie Confeſſion and meditation of the penitent.
                        
                        
                           I Altogether vnhappie and comfortleſſe, haue greeuouſlie offended my Lord God. What ſhall I do? Whether ſhall I go? I can not hide me from his ſight. How oft haue I treſpaſſed againſt him? How oft haue I deſerued his diſpleaſure? And yet how ſeldome hath he puniſhed me? How oft hath he beene good and mercifull vnto me? How oft haue I promiſed and vowed amendment, and how little and ſeldome haue I performed it? This is a wofull caſe. Who will haue pitie on me, I dare not lift vp mine eies towards heauen, becauſe I haue ſinned againſt it: and in earth I can looke for no refuge, becauſe I haue beene a ſlander and ſhame vnto it. What then? Should I deſpaire? No, God is mercifull, and a good Sauiour: he doth viſit them that liue in darknes, and is a cheerfull light to them that ſit in the ſhadowe

of death. He willeth vs to forgiue our brother, though he offend ſeuentie tunes, yea infinitelie. And God is more mercifull than anie man can be, and he muſt be the onlie refuge and comfort: he will not deſpiſe his creature, the image of himſelfe.
                        Returne thee therefore O my ſoule vnto thy Lord God, praie to him humblie on thy knees for grace, and continue to bewaile thy ſinnes paſt, becauſe that he which loueth thee, prouoketh thee dailie with his gratious gifts and bleſſings to loue him, and will not leaue thee, vntill he haue made perfect his worke begunne, and brought his mercie to full effect in thee. What naturall cauſe beginneth his worke, and leaueth it in the halfe waie imperfect? The vertue of ſeed ſowne, doth not ceaſe till the fruit be brought to perfection, yet that nature worketh not at once, but firſt prepareth the matter, and then diſpoſeth and makes it fit to receiue the ſhape, which is the perfection and end thereof. And as by naturall order, and right courſe things do proceede and increaſe by little and little, from the leſſe to the more, euen ſo doth God firſt diſpoſe vs to his mercie, and then increaſing his goodneſſe dailie, beſtoweth on vs in the end, the treaſure of his grace and inheritance of euerlaſting ioies. What bird forſaketh hir yong, till they be able to liue of themſelues, and yet no auaile, for their paine commeth to them. Uerie loue worketh in naturall cauſes, to bring foorth their affects to perfection. If it be ſo in creatures, what will the Creator doo? which is loue it ſelfe, and infinite goodneſſe; he will withdrawe thee from thy ſinnes, make thee cleane and pure, and finallie bleſſe thee with eternall life, which he hath prepared for thee. O Lord, I come to thee ſad and mourning, I ſit at thy feete, humblie waiting for thy mercie. Thou art my hope and helper, according to thy great mercies, haue mercie vpon me,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        
                        A praier to be purged from ſinne and vncleanneſſe.
                        
                        
                           TAke awaie from me, O Lord, the burden of my corruption, which by the continuall exerciſe of my ſinne and wickedneſſe, hath wounded my ſoule wofullie, with the dangerous darts of tranſgreſſion; ſo that I feele my putrifaction abounding, and my feſtered conſcience ouerladen with vncleanneſſe; ſo that I haue no other meane nor remedie, but to proſtrate my ſelfe before the throne of thy glorious maieſtie, beſeeching thee intirelie, of thy gratious goodneſſe, to ſalue my ſores with the comfortable oile of thy mercie.
                        Thou onlie (O Ieſu) art the ſweete Phyſition of my ſoule, ſprinkle vpon me hyſope, and I ſhall be made whiter than ſnowe. If thou of thine exceeding bountie and fauour good Lord, wilt vouchſafe to waſh awaie the ſpots of my ſinne and wickedneſſe, that heapeth thine indignation and furie againſt me, I ſhall then excell the gold that hath beene purified in the fornace ſeuen fold.
                        Let it therefore good Lord and mercifull father, ſeeme pleaſant vnto thy diuine maieſtie, to touch my corrupted and vncleane hart, with the heauenlie finger of thy grace, that I may bring foorth the fruits of true repentance, which are more acceptable to thy glorious and diuine preſence, than the offering of calues, bullockes, ſheepe, goates, or anie other burnt offerings, or ſacrifice of peace. A contrite and ſorowfull ſoule, is the thing that thou doeſt moſt delight in. An humble and a lowlie ſpirit is the oblation that thou dooeſt deſire. A cleane and pure hart, O Lord my God, I knowe thou dooeſt loue and fauour.
                        Wherefore I beſeech thee, to purge me from my ſinne and inquitie, of thy great mercie. Let the bitter

deploration of mine offences, and hartie contrition, through thy glorious merits and painefull paſſion, O Ieſu, be the onlie meane and waie to ſet me free from the powers of hell, death and damnation. And ſith I am by thy goodnes begotten and borne anew, ſtrengthen me good Lord, that I neuer ſlide nor fall from thee, but that I may continuallie beare in my remembrance, the ſtate wherevnto I am called by thee. Through thine aboundant loue and kindneſſe wipe awaie, good Lord, all my ſins out of thy remembrance. Cleanſe me in the bloud of thy ſpotleſſe Lambe Ieſus Chriſt, and I ſhall be made cleane, pure and ſafe. Graunt this moſt mercifull God, for the honour and glorie of thy name ſake, through the bitter death of thy ſonne Ieſus Chriſt my onlie mediatour and aduocate, to whome with thee and the holie Ghoſt, be giuen all laud, glorie, power, and praiſe for euer and euer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another praier of the penitent for mercie.
                        
                        
                           O Lord I am a ſinner, my ſinnes are heauie vpon me, the burden of them is intollerable, refreſh me with thy grace, waſh awaie mine offences, and I ſhall be whiter than the ſnowe. Let the cheerefull beames of thy countenance ſhine vpon me, and giue light to the darkeneſſe of my life. We can looke for nothing as deſerued, but puniſhment due to our offences. Wherefore good Lord, not according to thy iuſtice, but in the multitude of thy mercies, deale with thy ſeruant. Remember not the ſinnes of my forefathers: thinke not on the milde meanour of my youth paſſed: haue pitie on thy creature, which according to the likeneſſe of thy ſelfe thou haſt made and ſhaped of earth. How long wilt thou turne thy face awaie from me? Forſake me not, O my God, but renew in me thy holie ſpirit. Plucke awaie from

me all that withdraweth me from thee. Graffe in my hart thy grace, that I may loue thee, and feare thee, and ſo finallie reioice in thy goodneſſe with the elected, and praiſe thee in thy woonderous works for euer. Graunt this moſt mightie God, for our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt his ſake, to whome with thee and the holie Ghoſt, be all honor and glorie for euer and euer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another praier to be ſaid of the ſinfull ſoule.
                        
                        
                           MY ſinfull life increaſing, and my ſinnes ſtill abounding, good Lord; to whome ſhall I flee, or to whome ſhall I reſort for ſuccour? From offending thee I can not ceaſe, neither daie nor night; and my ſinnes are heauie vpon me, preſſing me downe euen to hell, ſuch is the weight thereof.
                        Moreouer, when I prepare my ſelfe to amendment of life, and thinke ſtedfaſtlie to ſerue and pleaſe thee, euen ſoone after doth my corrupt and infected nature offend and diſpleaſe thy diuine Maieſtie: ſo that I am prone and readie to run headlong into all kind of wickedneſſe and ſin, ſuch is my ſtrength, ſuch is my force, (or rather weakeneſſe) in perfourming thoſe things, which thou requireſt at my hands. So that good Lord, I am readie vtterlie to deſpaire, and forſake thee, vnleſſe thou of thy great mercie and pitie, ſend thine aide from aboue, and powre into me thy moſt healthfull grace, that I may make haſt to flee vnto thee with moſt bitter teares, a ſorrowfull hart, and bowing knees, lamenting my ſinfull life, and greeuous offences committed againſt thee, truſting moſt aſſuredlie and faithfullie, in the merits of my Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, that by his moſt bitter death & bloud-ſhedding, which is of far greater force, vertue and effect in preſeruing me, than all my ſinnes and offences are in condemning and caſting me awaie; for whoſe ſake I moſt aſſuredlie

beleeue all my ſinnes and offences are cleerelie forgiuen, and ſhall neuer be laid to my charge, but that I ſhall enter with thee in the laſt daie into thine euerlaſting kingdome, there to be with thee for euermore, to whome be all honour, praiſe and glorie, for euer and euer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        A praier to God the father.
                        
                           ALmightie God the father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, whome no deſert, merit, or worthineſſe of ours; but thine owne great clemencie, mercie and pitie cauſed to ſend downe thine onlie begotten ſonne into this world, to beare the burden of our ſinnes, with the which we moſt miſerable ſinners were ouerladen, and that he ſhould ſuffer moſt cruell torments, yea and alſo moſt bitter and ſhamefull death, and ſanctifie the reprochfull name of the croſſe, with the renting of his bleſſed bodie, and ſhedding his moſt pretious bloud thereon; thereby to make attonement betweene thee and vs, thereby to paie the raunſome for our ſoules, thereby to conſummate and finiſh the perfection of our redemption, and ſaluation. Which thing it was thy good will that he ſhould doo, not onelie to aſſwage thy wrath & indignation, but alſo to bring vs againe into thy grace and fauour; and that we being deliuered out of the bondage of ſinne and hell, might ſerue thee in righteouſneſſe and holineſſe, all the daies of our life, and by the free gift and benefite of his death and paſſion, be made partakers of his reſurrection, and of thine endleſſe and vnſpeakable glorie.
                        Wherefore my God, my maker, my Lord, my King, ſeeing thou haſt ſo aboundantlie beſtowed thy heauenlie gifts vpon me, and all mankind, and haſt ſo plentifullie powred out thy grace and fauour on vs, that for our ſakes thou wouldeſt not ſpare thine owne ſonne: how ſhall we eſcape thine indignation, which for this

care and kindneſſe of thine, are moſt careleſſe and vnkind? And among all other, which waie ſhall I poore creature turne me? How ſhall I, who haue beene moſt vnthankefull for thy benefits, and moſt vnmindfull of them, be ſo bold as to lift vp my hart or hands vnto the heauens, and to call vpon thee? Thou of thy ſingular goodneſſe didſt ſo prouide, that the wickedneſſe of old Adam ſhould be purged and waſhed awaie with the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt; but I haue wilfullie fallen into ſinne againe. Thou madeſt me the child of light, but I haue made my ſelfe an inheritour of darkeneſſe. Thou madeſt me thine by creation, I haue made my ſelfe the child of perdition.
                        What ſhall I now therefore do? Shall I doubt of anie further mercie and forgiueneſſe? No no, ſweete Lord, ſo great is thy mercie, which ſurmounteth all thy workes; ſo large are thy promiſes; ſo ſure is the performance of them to all ſuch as take hold thereof; ſo deere in thy ſight are the merits of thy ſonne Ieſus; ſo acceptable vnto thee is the hartie repentance of a ſinner, that with the remembrance thereof, I am prouoked to crie vnto thee, ſaieng: Father, I haue ſinned againſt heauen, and againſt thee, I am no more worthie to be called thy child. Neuertheleſſe, behold thou me, not as I am, a greeuous offender, but as thy creature. Haue now no reſpect to mine offences, but behold my repentance: thinke not vpon my wickedneſſe, but vpon the wounds of my Sauiour Ieſus. Looke not vpon my falſe hart, which hath wauered from thy lawes, but behold the bleeding hart of thy ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, which was pierced to releaſe me, and ſet me free. My ſinnes I caſt vpon thy backe, beſeeching thee that his merits may beare them, and thy mercie pardon them.
                        Heare me O Lord my God, heare me: for I knowe, the more earneſtlie that I ſeeke for, and deſire thine

aide, the readier thou art to ſtretch foorth thine hand to helpe me. Heare me therefore, O Lord; bow downe and incline thine eare vnto my praier: inſpire me ſo with thy holie ſpirit, that I may loue thee aboue all things, and that I neuer faile to put my hope and truſt of ſaluation in him, whome thou wouldeſt to be my redeemer and ſauiour.
                        Make me, by the forſaking of all wickedneſſe, ſo to riſe from falling into ſinne, that I may obtaine the true ſeruing of thee with innocencie, and pureneſſe of life. Graunt this O Lord, for Ieſus Chriſts ſake, to whome with thee and the holie Ghoſt be all honour and glorie,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        A praier vnto God the ſonne.
                        
                           O Moſt ſweet ſauiour, O moſt mercifull redeemer; O bountifull Ieſu, the ſonne of God; who although thou art high, yet thou art moſt humble; although thou art omnipotent, thou art alſo moſt meeke: and as thou art moſt mightie, ſo art thou moſt mercifull. To thee, O Chriſt, the guide of all felicitie, the father of heauen hath giuen all power, both in heauen and in earth.
                        Thou art the true paſtor of our ſoules, thou art our Meſſias. Thou caſteſt off none that ſue vnto thee, but as thou haſt taken awaie the hand-writing that was againſt vs, and haſt faſtened it to thy croſſe, ſo art thou readie to impart the merits of thy paſſion vnto all ſuch, as with true repentance of their ſins call vpon thee faithfullie.
                        Wherefore my ſweet Ieſus, I moſt faithfullie and vnfeinedlie acknowledge the benefits that thou haſt beſtowed vpon me, and ſtedfaſtlie beleeue, that thou being an immaculate lambe, in whoſe mouth was neuer found guile, didſt ſuffer moſt cruell torments at the hands of ſinners, for the loue of vs moſt wretched ſinners.

For the which cauſe, I moſt hartilie beſeech thee, and moſt humblie praie thee, to accept me into the number of them, whom thou wilt make coinheritours of thy bitter paines. And although I of my ſelfe, be moſt vnworthie thereof, yet thy merits can make me woorthie: to them do I flie, crauing that I may be ſo armed and defended by them, that I may ſubdue the world, the fleſh and the diuell, euen as thou haſt gloriouſlie conquered ſinne, death and hell.
                        Thou ſeeſt, O my ſauiour, how I am dailie and hourlie beſet with theſe three enimies, and ſo hardlie beſeeged of them, that without thy helpe, I can by no meanes eſcape, but that I muſt needs be a praie vnto one of them. Strengthen me therefore O Lord, that neither the one with carnall luſts, neither the other with delectable pleaſures, nor Sathan himſelfe with all his craftie and ſubtile deuiſes get the dominion ouer me.
                        Thou haſt bought me, thou haſt paid for me; take thou me, ſaue, keepe and defend me, be alwaies readie at the voice of my crieng; powre into me thy grace, patientlie to abide thy diuine will and pleaſure in all things. Make me both at this preſent, and all the daies of my life, to haue in mind, and profoundlie to roote in my hart, the myſteries of thy painefull paſſion, and ſo to be filled with the remembrance thereof, that ſin may no more enter into me, and that Sathan mine old enimie may well perceiue, that he hath neither part nor fellowſhip in me, but that I am both bodie and ſoule altogether thine, to whome be all praiſes world without end,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        A praier vnto God the holie Ghoſt.
                        
                           O Holie Ghoſt, O bleſſed and holie ſpirit, comforter of them that be afflicted: thou proceeding from the Father and the Sonne, art the true

inſtructor and teacher of the diuine and heauenlie veritie. Wherefore, I with all humilitie praie thee to renew and make in me a cleane hart, to graffe a right ſpirit in me, to guide and gouerne me, that I may thinke nothing, ſpeake nothing, doo nothing, but that onlie which ſhall pleaſe thee.
                        And whereas I haue not ceaſed to offend my Lord God and maker, and moſt greeuouſlie to tranſgreſſe againſt Ieſus my redeemer and ſauiour; I praie thee that I may haue inward ſorowe, repentance, and ſhame thereof; and that euer hereafter I may performe my dutie, as I ought to doo, and ſo bring foorth the fruits of repentance, that the paſſion of Ieſus Chriſt may defend me from all ſinne and wickedneſſe, and bring me to the ioies of paradiſe: So be it.
                        
                     
                     
                        A godlie praier for the true worſhipping of God, which may be vſed in the Church before common praier.
                        
                        
                           STabliſh our harts and minds, O moſt gratious God, in the true woorſhipping of thy diuine maieſtie; make vs to beleeue thy holie and ſacred Goſpell, wherein we are dailie and hourelie inſtructed to loue, feare, honour, and obeie thee: to hate ſinne and iniquitie, to renounce all ſuperſtitious ceremonies, whereby thy worſhip is defaced, thy glorie prophaned, and thine honour greatlie diminiſhed. Giue vs the grace to hate ſinne and iniquitie, to renounce and forſake the vanities and wanton pleaſures of this wicked and ſinfull world. Arme vs, we beſeech thee, to mortifie and bring vnder the rebellious appetites and ſtraieng luſts of the fleſh. And finallie giue vs power from aboue, to withſtand Sathan the prince of darkneſſe, and all his damnable miniſters, who by diuers temptations prouoke and allure vs from godlie puritie, and perfect integritie, which paſſeth onlie from Chriſt Ieſus vnto vs, who

is the fulneſſe of our perfection and holineſſe, to all kinds of euill, impietie and vncleanneſſe; by meanes whereof thy worſhip is greatlie prophaned, and of a ſet purpoſe contemned.
                        Make vs conſtant to ſkirmiſh againſt the world, ſinne, death, and hell; and by the power of a fruitefull faith, giue vs grace to reſiſt and bridle the concupiſcence of our fleſh, in ſuch ſort, that our ſoules may triumph with victorie, and continue conſtant in woorſhipping thee; from whom paſſeth the fulneſſe of our ioie. Prepare our harts and minds (good Lord) now and euer to ſpread foorth the glorie of thy name. Kéepe our tongues from all filthie talke, and vncomelie geſture, leaſt by the exerciſe of ſuch ſinne, we contemne thy worſhip, and prouoke thee to diſpleaſure and indignation. Set thou a watch before the gates of my mouth, that my lips by thy grace may be alwaies made open to ſound foorth thy praiſe and euerlaſting glorie. Be mercifull to our offences, thinke thou not on our vnrighteouſneſſe; but vpon thy clemencie. Forgiue them freelie, and pardon gratiouſlie our ſinnes, make vs faithfull in Chriſt Ieſus. Shorten the dangerous daies of iniquitie, increaſe the number of thy choſen and peculiar Saincts. Haſten thy comming, O ſauiour Chriſt, that we with the felowſhip of the Saints, heauenlie Angels, and the bleſſed companie of Martyrs, may celebrate thy praiſe, and worſhip thee in thy glorious kingdome, before the father our God, and the holie Ghoſt, to whome be praiſe for euer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another praier that we may liue ſo vprightlie in this life, that at the last we may dwell in the euerlasting tabernacle.
                        
                        
                           O Lord, ſeeing that the righteous ſhall dwell in thy tabernacle, graunt me I beſeech thee, a pure and vndefiled ſoule. O what is the ſhape of the earth, wherein Gods enimies

haue abiding; in compariſon of the woonderfull beautie of heauen, wherein righteouſneſſe doth dwell; in compariſon of that place, wherein Angels, Archangels, all good men, yea and God himſelfe is abiding! What are the pleaſures of the world, wealth, honour, companie of our parents and friends, wherein all our pleaſure and ſweeteneſſe is mixed with ſowreneſſe and ſorowe; wherein euerie perfection hath his imperfection▪ What is all this to the vnſpeakeable ioie in the kingdome of God? What is the companie of friends heere, in compariſon to the companie of Abraham, Iſaac and Iacob, the Patriarches and Prophets, and all the Saints of God?
                        Oh the felicitie of euerlaſting life, which is without all diſcommodities; perpetuall, without all perill and moleſtation! Oh the glorious maieſtie, the ſingular mirth, and paſſing ioies of the life to come! The eie hath not ſeene, nor the hart of man is able to conceiue in anie part, the happie eſtate of the bleſſed ſoules in heauen. Oh how amiable are thy tabernacles! My ſoule hath a deſire to enter into the courts of the Lord. My hart and my ſoule reioice in the liuing God; bleſſed be they that dwell in thy houſe, they may be alwaies praiſing thee. One daie in thy courts, is better than a thouſand elſewhere. I had rather be a dore-keeper in the houſe of my God, than to dwell in the tents of vngodlineſſe. The Lord God is a light and defence. My ſoule is athirſt for God, euen for the liuing God. When ſhall I come before the preſence of my God? My fleſh longeth after thee in a barren and drie land, where no water is. Good Lord remember me, and graunt that I may weare the white garments of innocencie with thine elected, in thine euerlaſting kingdome,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        
                        A praier againſt the felowſhip of the vngodlie.
                        
                        
                           PRotect and defend me, O heauenlie Father, and moſt mercifull God, from the felowſhip of the vngodlie men, which dailie imagine miſchiefe in their harts to harme the innocent. Keepe me from the counſels of the fooliſh and vngodlie, which ſpeake proud things againſt the glorie of thy bleſſed name. Defend me from faithleſſe and deceiptfull ones, whoſe guiltie ſtomaches are gorged with grudge, enuie, malice, hatred, diſdaine, and all vncharitableneſſe. For their throtes are like vnto an open ſepulchre, or ſwallowing graue: their tongs are giuen to ſlander and backbite their neighbours: the poiſon of Adders lieth hidden vnder their lips; and in fine, they as thine enimies blaſpheme thy holie and bleſſed name, and contemne thy teſtimonies.
                        O Lord giue me thy grace, to be conuerſant with good and godlie men; ſuch as fauour thy glorious Goſpell, and doo their indeuour to practiſe thy precepts, to the glorie of thy holie and bleſſed name. Make me, by their example, to exerciſe my ſelfe in the heauenlie veritie; that thereby I may be inſtructed in the liuelie knowledge of thy commandements, and obtaine ſuch wiſdome from aboue, that by faith I may cleaue to thee, and the felowſhip of thoſe that feare thy holie name; and ſo auoide the companie of the wicked and vngodlie worldlings, which haue laid ſnares to intrap mee. Graunt this, O moſt mercifull Father, for thy ſonne Ieſus Chriſts ſake, who euer liueth and reigneth with thee, and the holie Ghoſt, to whome be all laude, glorie, power and praiſe, for euer and euer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        
                        A praier to be ſaid before or after the Sermon.
                        
                        
                           MOſt mightie GOD, which by thy word haſt made all things, whoſe voice the flouds and hils doo knowe, whoſe heaſt both quicke and dead, heauen and hell obey, at whoſe diſpleaſure the diuels in hell doo tremble: let thy word ſo lighten our harts, that by our good works we may teſtifie our profeſſion, ſeeing that the tree which beareth not fruit ſhall be cut downe, & throwne into the fire. Grant that I may not onelie be a hearer, but alſo a dooer of thy holie word, that ſo finallie I may be partaker of thine euerlaſting ioie and bliſſe.
                        O Lord grant me wiſdome to knowe thee, and grace to followe thee in true humilitie: that as thou didſt ſuffer to be ſpitted at, and ſmitten of thine enimies; ſo we may beare the diſpleaſures of the world, and rage of our enimies with patience. Thou haſt bleſſed the little ones, and reuealed vnto them the things hidden from the wiſe. For thou wilt haue mercie where it pleaſeth thee. O ſet thy feare alwaies before mine eies, make me to vnderſtand wiſdome ſecretlie; and graffe thy faith ſo in my hart, that I may both knowe thee, and loue thee, and glorifie thy holie name for euer:
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        A praier for faith.
                        
                           O Bleſſed Sauiour Ieſus, ſonne of the euerliuing God, the vnſpeakeable ioie of thy ſeruants, moſt preſent cōfort to ſinners, which cameſt into the world to ſaue offenders, which ſo louedſt the world, that thou ſparedſt not thy moſt pretious bloud to redeeme the loſſe of our firſt father Adam, and to make vs coheires of the forfeited inheritance with thy ſelfe; that all which beleeue in thee might be ſaued. Good Lord, which haſt promiſed

to them that knocke, it ſhall be opened; and that they which ſeeke ſhall find: grant I beſeech thee, that I may ſearch thy holie lawes, and find the truth of thy holie word; that I may alwaies conſtantlie confeſſe and ſhew thee and thy goodneſſe, as well in my words as liuing. Inſpire me with thy holie ſpirit, that I may knowe thee ſtedfaſtlie, truſt in thee, and ſerue thee in praiers and well-dooing, all the time of my life. O moſt mercifull Lord and Sauiour of the world, for the glorie of thy name ſake, I beſeech thee to heare my praiers. My ſoule reioice in God my ſauing health, for hee hath been good to thee, he hath kept thee from the ſnare of the hunter, and bleſſed thee. The Lord is a mercifull God, let all the earth feare him: let the mouths of all men ſound praiſes vnto him. God is a good Lord, and dailie increaſeth his good gifts to his ſeruants; the Lord will increaſe my faith in him, and I ſhall be ſaued: So be it.
                        
                     
                     
                        A praier to be ſaid before the receiuing of the Lords Supper.
                        
                        
                           OMnipotent GOD and father euerlaſting, whoſe mercie is infinite, and whoſe kingdom hath none end; vouchſafe I beſeech thee, of thine exceeding goodnes, to increſe our faith, that as thy gheſts repaire to the table of thy ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, who hath left vnto vs, before he gaue his bodie to be crucified, and his bloud to be ſhed largelie on the croſſe for our redemption, as a pledge of his great loue and abundant kindneſſe, the celebration of his glorious ſupper, wherein as it were in a looking glaſſe, the death of our great maiſter, the high ſhepheard of our ſoules Ieſus Chriſt, is moſt liuelie ſet foorth vnto vs. Giue vs grace therefore from aboue, rightlie to vnderſtand the diuine myſteries offered vnto vs thereby, and not to wreſt or wring the ſame

contrarie to thy will.
                        Let it be far from our thoughts, good Lord, to leaue thine eternall veritie; and to build on the doctrine of men, who following their owne imaginations, run headlong to the gaping gulph of danger and deſtruction. Plucke the ſcales of ignorance from our eies, that we may cleerlie deſcerne and behold, by the light of thy glorious Goſpell, how we may truelie communicate and participate the fruits of thy grace, repreſented vnto vs in this comfortable Sacrament. Indue vs plentifullie with ſuch pure knowledge, that we may not once thinke or ſaie after anie groſſe forme, or carnall maner, we feede vpon, or eate thy fleſh reallie, or carnallie; but make vs alwaies conſtantlie to beleeue, that thy glorious bodie is aſcended vp into heauen, and ſitteth on the right hand of thy Father, concerning thy humanitie; and cannot be thence remooued, till the time that thou ſhalt come with legions of Angels, to iudge the quicke and the dead, before whoſe preſence ſhall run a conſuming fire.
                        And moreouer, wee doo moſt humblie beſeech thee ſo to confirme vs in the truth of thy bleſſed teſtament, that we may confeſſe thy diuine nature to be equall with the Father and the holie Ghoſt; and to beleeue that thy power is not a power particular, but a power generall; and ſuch as doth and ſhall gouerne in heauen and earth, in the deepe and lowe waters: yea and in the nethermoſt parts of hell. Strengthen vs therefore good Lord, that ſtand; leaſt that in falling from the true knowledge of thee, we periſh euerlaſtinglie.
                        And ſith thou haſt called vs by thy word, as thy gheſts to this bleſſed banket, wherin ye mouths of our carnall bodies are foſtered & fed with bread and wine: ſo Lord confirme our faith in thee, that the mouths of our ſoules may feed ſpirituallie vpon thy ſweeteſt fleſh, and drinke thy deereſt blood, and ſo be nouriſhed to euerlaſting

life, and heauenlie bleſſedneſſe. Which reward as a dowrie due, thou haſt promiſed to all thoſe that faithfullie build vpon thee, which art the rocke and ſtrong piller of our ſaluation.
                        And as theſe moſt holie myſteries muſt ſet foorth vnto vs moſt liuelie thy death and paſſion; ſo make vs thankefull to thee for the ſame: and thereby giue vs grace, to print in our harts thy great loue and exceeding clemencie, that ſparedſt not to giue thy bodie to the moſt vile, ſhamefull and ſlanderous death of the Croſſe; and thy bloud to be ſhed for our offences.
                        Indue vs with loue and charitie to all men; make vs readie to forgiue, to loue, and pardon our enimies, perſecutors and ſlanderers. Turne our harts & minds from all impietie, couetouſneſſe, blaſphemie, pride, gluttonie, fornication, and all other deteſtable euils. And if at anie time we haue defeated the fatherleſſe of his right, the widowe of hir dowrie, or gathered togither our goods wrongfullie, by violence, oppreſſion, fraud, colluſion, or deceit: giue vs grace to make reſtitution, and to aſke with ſorowfull plaints and fluds of teares, from the bottome of our harts, pardon and free forgiueneſſe of thee, for ſuch and all other our offences whatſoeuer wee haue done, or committed in thought, word, will and deed, againſt thy diuine Maieſtie, or anie other our brethren and ſiſters.
                        Take awaie from vs ali bitternes, curſed ſpeaking and backbiting. Giue vs grace to come woorthilie, by the vertue of a true and fruitfull faith, to this holie and bleſſed ſupper, that our ſoules feeding faithfullie on thy ſweeteſt fleſh, and drinking thy deereſt bloud, wee may both in bodie and ſoule be nouriſhed by thee to euerlaſting and endleſſe glorie in heauen, where with thee and the felowſhip of thy choſen Saints, we ſhall enioie the fruition of the euerlaſting kingdome, which thou haſt ordeined for all thoſe that ouelie and alone,

without wauering doo build vpon thee.
                        Sanctifie and make cleane our harts and minds, by the power of thy holie Ghoſt, the verie comforter of thy choſen. Purge thou our cankred conſciences, infected with ſinne, by the working of thy good grace, leaſt that by the preſuming to this thy table, O Lord, we incur thy diſpleaſure; and being vnrepentant for our offences, we be found vnmeet gheſts to come to thy holie banket, and ſo we eate and drinke to the vtter confuſion of our ſoules and bodies. Giue vs grace therefore good Lord, to conuert vs wholie vnto thee, and we ſhall be turned from all our ſinne and iniquitie. Giue vs grace to reſt onlie vpon thee, and we ſhall be made ſafe. Giue vs thine aid from aboue, we beſeech thee, by faith to ſtriue with the man of ſinne, and ſo to vanquiſh him, that he may die to vs, and we may liue to thee, which art the giuer of life. Grant this, O moſt gratious God, for Ieſus Chriſt his ſake, to whom with thee and the holie Ghoſt be giuen all praiſe, honour and glorie, for euer and euer:
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        A praier or thankeſgiuing to be ſaid after the receiuing of the Communion.
                        
                        
                           WE giue thee moſt hartie thanks, O heauenlie Father, that haſt at this preſent fed vs, and refreſhed our hungrie ſoules with the fleſh and bloud of our Sauiour Chriſt; not carnallie, but ſpirituallie. Giue vs grace therefore continuallie, by the meanes of an increaſing and fruitfull faith, to beleeue that thy fleſh is meate indeed, and thy bloud is drinke indeed: and that vnneths we eate thy fleſh, and drinke thy bloud, we can not enter into thy kingdome, nor be ſaued in the daie of thy comming. Giue vs grace therefore, being vnprofitable ſeruants, and vnwoorthilie called, by the reaſon of the multitude of our ſinnes, to banket at thy table, whereas the celebration

of thy ſupper hath beene vſed, and thy death by the viſible elements of bread and wine repreſented vnto vs, to offer vp vnto thee continuallie the fruits of true, repentant, and ſorowfull harts, that thy name may be glorified, we by thy grace comforted, thy diſpleaſure turned to loue, thy wrath to compaſſion, our ſinnes pardoned and forgotten, and our names written in the booke of life.
                        And as it hath pleaſed thee at this preſent to account vs for thy gheſts, and not onlie to feede vs with viſible creatures, namelie bread and wine: but alſo in ſoule, which is thine owne ſimilitude, to cheriſh vs with thy fleſh and bloud, wheron by the vertue of a liuelie faith we haue to our great comforts moſt plentifullie fed: ſo now, O Lord, we beſeech thee of thine abundant goodneſſe, to increaſe our faith, that it may wax ſtrong in thee, and fruitfull to exerciſe the works of charitie and loue to all men; that therby as we haue now been at the celebration of thy glorious and bleſſed ſupper, ſo we may, whenſoeuer it ſhall pleaſe thee to call vs to thine heauenly banket, be found furniſhed: not emptie, not naked, but armed and couered with fruitfull faith and truth, and ſo, as thy gheſts or veſſels of honour enioie the participation of thy heauenlie and rich palace, whereas ioies neuer vade, but continuallie endure. Take from vs the burden of our corruption; ſet vs free from the curſed clog of ſinne; deliuer vs from the ſnares of death and deſtruction. Giue vs willing minds to obeie and heare thy commandements, clenſe thou our harts from all iniquitie, and giue vs grace henceforth to walke in newneſſe of life, and godlie conuerſation, that thy name may be glorified, and we ſaued in the daie of thy comming to iudgement. Grant this for Jeſus Chriſt his ſake our mediatour and aduocate:
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        
                        A godlie praier to be ſaid of euerie Chriſtian, eſpeciallie at burials.
                        
                        
                           GOod Lord, which with thy hands doeſt ſtaie the frame & engin of the earth, and ruleſt the courſe of the ſwift heauens, diſpoſing and ordering all things by thy diuine prouidence, which haſt apointed bounds to our life, which we can not pas: I beſech thee that by my liuing, I learning to die, mortifieng by thy ſpirit the affections of the fleſh, though not expelling them, yet ſubduing the rage of them, it may at the laſt, by the hauen of death, land in the moſt glorious citie of euerlaſting life; where our bodies which are now darke, miſerable and corruptible, ſhall be moſt bright, glorious and incorruptible, like to the immortall and ſhining bodie of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. We ſhall be like to Chriſt our Sauiour; euen as he is, ſo ſhall we be. And as we haue borne the image of the earthlie, ſo ſhall we beare the image of the heauenlie, and ſhine like to the ſunne, as the face of Chriſt did in his tranſfiguration.
                        Oh Lord Ieſus, bleſſed Sauiour, which by thy death haſt triumphed ouer ſinne and death; thou haſt troden on the ſting of the monſter, our hidious enimie; the gates of hel haue not preuailed againſt thee: grant to me a true and liuelie faith, by which men paſſe from earth to heauen, from death to eternall life. This can we not doo without thee, thou muſt be our mediatour. For a child of a nights birth is not pure in thy ſight. In ſinne were we borne, and by nature we are the children of perdition, and firebrands of hell: but thou, O bleſſed Sauiour, art the perfection of the lawe to them that beleeue. As death came by ſinnes; ſo by thy death and pretious bloudſhedding is death conquered and exiled; and we that beleeue waſhed and clenſed of our ſinnes. All the Prophets beare witneſſe, that they

which beleeue in thy name ſhall receiue remiſſion of their ſinnes. If we confeſſe our ſinnes, thou art righteous to forgiue vs our iniquities. Whoſoeuer calleth on thy name ſhall be ſaued. Thou haſt no pleaſure in the death of a ſinner, but rather deſireſt that they ſhould liue, and be conuerted. Thou haſt ſo loued the world, that thou not onlie didſt become man, and tooke our nature vpon thee, but wert content alſo to ſuffer moſt cruell death on the Croſſe, to purge our nature from mortall ſinne and corruption, and adorne it with immortalitie and eternall glorie; not onelie in thine owne perſon, but in vs alſo, to ſatiſfie the iuſtice of the Father for our ſinnes.
                        Oh bleſſed ſhepheard, thou doubtedſt not to ſpend thy moſt pretious blood to ſaue thy beloued ſheepe from rauine and ſpoile. Good Lord, ſo increaſe thy grace in me, that thy holie word may take roote, and flouriſh in me, that the good ſeed may not be choked with thornes. So order my liuing, that when by courſe of nature I ſhall be diſſolued from the priſon of my bodie, I may come to thee, that when thou more bright than the ſun ſhalt come in the midſt of the legions of Angels, in thy ſhining glorie and Maieſtie to iudge the quicke & the dead, I may be in the number of the bleſſed ones, whom thou ſhalt call to poſſeſſe the kingdome prepared for them, by thy Father, ſaieng: Come ye bleſſed children of my Father, receiue the kingdome prepared for you before the beginning of the world. Thou which didſt die and riſe againe, wilt raiſe and bring to life all thoſe that are dead beleeuing in thy faith: So be it.
                        
                     
                     
                        A praier to liue well.
                        
                           GOod Lord ſo rule the eies of my hart, that they being kept ſimple and pure, my bodie may be a cleere and ſhining temple of thy holie ſpirit. So kindle in vs the loue of thy glorious

ſonne, that we following his ſteps, may doo that which is good, and decline from the euill; ſo that our light ſhining before men, we may glorifie thee by our good works, with thy bleſſed ſonne our Sauiour, and the holie Ghoſt: to whoſe infinite Maieſtie, in trinitie and vnitie be all honour and glorie for euer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        A praier for humilitie.
                        
                           O Lord I am a ſinner, and ſorie for mine offences: I can not make ſatiſfaction for my defaults. If I haue anie good thing, it commeth of thee. The moſt acceptable ſacrifice to thee is a contrite and humble hart. O God let mee not be oppreſſed with the waues of ſinne, let mee not ſinke into the whirlepoole and gulph of deſpaire. Thou which lifteſt vp the fallen, and raiſeſt the humble and meeke, clothing them with purple, and ſetteſt them vp with princes in the ſeates of honour; thou which deſpiſeſt the imaginations of the proud, and reſiſteſt their enterpriſes; bleſſe me in all my dooings, ſend mee happie ſucceſſe in all mine affaires, that I may reioice in thy goodneſſe, with thine elected for euer and euer. Accept my humble ſuite, good Lord, I beſeech thee, for the glorie of thy name ſake,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        A praier for the obteining of Gods grace.
                        
                        
                           O Almightie and mercifull God, ſhine we beſeech thee, through the power of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and the comfortable working of thy ſacred ſpirit, the heauenlie comforter, vpon our minds and harts, with the glorious beames of thy heauenlie grace. Giue vs ſuch plentie of wiſedome and vnderſtanding from aboue, that through the knowledge of thee, the man of ſinne, that is, our fraile and feeble fleſh, with the wicked luſts and deſire of concupiſcence

may lie dead and buried in vs. Giue vs, good Lord, the feeling of thy grace, that by the vertue and diuine operation of thy word, the eies of our ſoules may be illumined, and made ſo light, that the Prince of darkeneſſe, with all his vnrighteous miniſters, may be expulſed and baniſhed from our memories. So eſtabliſh vs in thy truth, that our harts, minds, and thoughts, may continuallie be occupied in thy teſtimonies: that thereby thou good Lord effectuallie ſhining in our harts, by the vertue of thy good ſpirit, we may learne to knowe and vnderſtand, what is the fulneſſe of our calling, and how rich thou art in the glorie of thy celeſtiall and heauenlie heritage of thy Saincts, and that excellent greatneſſe of thy power and louing kindneſſe towards vs, which beleeue without faining thy holie Goſpell, according to the might and force of thy ſtrength, which thou ſhewedſt in Chriſt Ieſus, when thou didſt raiſe him from the dead, and didſt ſet him on thy right hand, far aboue all empire, power, authoritie and dominion, and euerie name that is named, not onlie in this world, but in the world to come. By whoſe pretious death, and deereſt bloud-ſhedding, we are aſſured, that ſinne, death and hell are vanquiſhed, ouercome, and vtterlie deſtroied. And if we beleeue without wauering, we ſhall in him be able to reſiſt all the power of hell, and in Chriſt as conquerors, to triumph with victorie ouer ſinne, death, and Sathan, and at the laſt to haue and enioie the fruition of his rich and glorious kingdome, which he by moſt painefull agonie, bloudie ſtripes, greeuous and bloudie wounds, and laſtlie by his moſt painefull death, purchaſed for his choſen and elect. To whome for our ſanctification, iuſtification, redemption, and our ſaluation be rendred, with his celeſtiall Father, and the holie Ghoſt, all laud, glorie, power, honour and dominion for euer and euer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        
                        A praier againſt preſumptuous pride and vaine-glorie.
                        
                        
                           WE heare, O heauenlie Father, and are dailie taught and inſtructed out of thine eternall word, how greatlie the greeuous ſinne of preſumption, pride, and vaine-glorie diſpleaſeth thy diuine maieſtie. We are learned, that for the practiſe of this peſtilent and heinous euill, thou haſt not ſpared the verie Angels, but haſt throwne them in thy diſpleaſure, for their pride, vaine-glorie, and preſumption, from beatitude, to miſerie: from ioie without end, to perdurable paine: from brightneſſe of thy glorious preſence, to vtter extreame and palpable darkeneſſe: from the glorious fruition, and participation of thine euerlaſting kingdome, to the bottomleſſe pit of hell, death, damnation, and endleſſe flames of fire. Beſides this, we are taught that by the tranſgreſſion of Adam, whoſe haughtie preſuming, through the entiſement of the ſubtile and perillous allurement of the Serpent, thought to be as thy ſelfe; but in fine, thy iuſtice condemned him, and all his poſteritie.
                        This peſtiferous ſinne of pride drowned him in the flouds of all dangerous euils, as gluttonie, luxurie, and ſuch other perils; that had not thy mercie taken effect, to keepe and hold plea for his and our ſafegard; and thy ſonne Chriſt embaſed the glorie and power of his diuine eſſence, and taken vpon him our fleſh and fraile nature, ſinne onlie except, who freelie offered his innocent bodie to the death of the croſſe, we had periſhed euerlaſtinglie, and beene vtterlie confounded. Print therefore good Lord, and write theſe examples in my memorie, that I fall not from thy fauour, by the exerciſe of this deteſtable ſinne. Make me ſtill to conſider, that the proud and diſdainefull are alwaies abhorred in thy ſight. And ſith it is thy good will, and gratious

pleaſure, to regard the humble and lowlie man, giue me ſuch meekeneſſe from aboue, that I may continuallie preſent thee with the ſacrifice of a gentle, meeke, and contrite ſpirit: that I may auoide the plagues and puniſhments which thou haſt prepared for the proud and haughtie minded. Graunt this good Lord, for Ieſus Chriſt his ſake, mine onlie mediator & aduocate, who liueth and reigneth with thee and the holie Ghoſt, in glorie permanent & euerlaſting,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        A praier againſt couetouſneſſe, or too much care of the world.
                        
                        
                           GOod Lord, ſeeing that it is thy pleaſure, that we ſhall not be carefull for worldlie things: if a ſparowe falleth not on the ground without thy fore-ſight, how much more care doeſt thou take for vs thy children? Good Lord, thou feedeſt the birds of the aire, and cloatheſt the lillies of the feeld, which take no care. Wherefore good Lord, ſo prouide for our neceſſitie and ſickneſſe, we beſeech thee, that we caſting all our care vpon thee, may cheeflie ſtudie to pleaſe thee, and ſerue thee, which liueſt and reigneſt king of all kings for euer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        A praier againſt lieng and euill imaginations.
                        
                           O Lord cleanſe my hart, I beſeech thee, from all vnpure & wicked cogitations and thoughts; and giue me a cleere conſcience, ſhamefaſt eies, innocent hands, and a tongue to tell the truth; ſeeing that there is nothing hid, that ſhall not be diſcouered. Good Lord I beſeech thee to ſearch my thoughts, and renew in me thy holie ſpirit. Direct my feete in thy waies, that walking after thee, in the path of the righteous, I may paſſe through this vale of miſerie, bearing thy banner ſtoutelie in my warfare, and obtaine euerlaſting ioie; the promiſed hire to ſuch as

here haue patientlie borne thy croſſe, and valiantlie fought with the armour of faith, againſt temptations and all euils. Vouchſafe, O Lord, to graunt my petitions, I moſt humblie beſeech thee, for thy onlie begotten ſonne, our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt his ſake,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        A neceſſarie praier in Meeter againſt vices.
                        
                        
                           O Lord my God, make thou my hart repentant for to be,
                           The ſpirit of contrition, do thou ingraffe in me.
                           Unto mine eies let there be giuen aboundant teares of wéeping,
                           And let my hands be occupied with often almes giuing.
                           O thou my King quench out of me all foule fleſhlie deſire,
                           And with the loue of thée alone ſet thou my hart on fire.
                           O my redéemer driue awaie the ſpirit of pride from me,
                           And graunt to me that great treaſure of méeke humilitie.
                           Take from me O my Sauiour, the furious rage of ire,
                           The ſhield of patience giue to me, the which I do deſire.
                           O Creator roote out of me all ſpitefulneſſe of mind,
                           And graunt in ſtead thereof againe méekenes that I may find.
                           O bountifull father giue me a faith that ſhall endure,
                           With hope agréeing therevnto, and charitie moſt ſure.
                           O thou my guide kéepe from my lips all lieng vanitie,
                           And from my mind driue far awaie all vaine vnconſtancie.
                           All wauering take thou from my hart, & from my mouth ſcoffing,
                           With all proud lookes and gluttonie, backbiting & ſlandering.
                           Couetouſnes wipe cleane awaie, with curioſitie,
                           The fond deſire of vaine-glorie, with all hypocriſie.
                           Let me neuer the poore deſpiſe, nor yet the weake oppreſſe,
                           And let me not blaſpheme, for then I die remedileſſe.
                           O thou which didſt me forme & make, take all raſhneſſe from mée,
                           And leaue me not ſuch a mind as, will not with peace agrée.
                           Take from me ydleneſſe and ſloth, and heauie lumpiſhneſſe,
                           Take from me diſobedience, and eke all ſtubborneſſe.
                           O my God, for thy déere ſonnes ſake, I humblie beſéech thée,
                           To graunt me the works of mercie, with aboundance of pitie,
                           
                              
That I may thée both loue and feare, and eke pitie the poore,
                           Make me good men alwaies to loue, and wicked to abhor.
                           Make me ſo little to eſtéeme thoſe things that worldlie bée,
                           With hart & voice that I may craue in heauen to be with thée:
                        
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        A thankeſgiuing for benefits receiued at Gods hand.
                        
                        
                           O Moſt mercifull Father, I yeeld thee moſt humble thanks, for thy great benefits beſtowed vpon me a ſinner, of thy free mercie onlie. Thou haſt of thy fatherlie loue brought me vp tenderlie, and inſtructed me in thy holie lawe. Thou haſt giuen me knowledge and vnderſtanding. Thou haſt preſerued me from manie dangers and euils, which diuers men haue felt. Thou haſt bleſſed me with health, quietneſſe, ioie, plentie and wealth, which a number doo want. Thou haſt taken care of me, and done all things for me. Lord, though I can deſerue nothing but puniſhment by thy iuſt diſpleaſure, yet good Lord, I truſt to thy goodneſſe, crauing mercie, and not iuſtice. And for thy mercie ſake, I beſeech thee to continue thy grace, and to increaſe thy good gifts towards me, and haue me in thy protection till my liues end. Good Lord bleſſe me, that I may enioie the fruits of the earth, and vſe them to thy honour and glorie. Good Lord be thou mine aid and guide in all my dooings: my buckler and defence in all dangers, that I may freelie and ioifullie ſing praiſes to thee, which liueſt and reigneſt one God almightie and incomprehenſible, worlds without end,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another thankeſgiuing for the goodneſſe of God to vs.
                        
                        
                           O Almightie God, and euer-ruling King, whoſe infinite power and maieſtie our wits can not comprehend; whoſe glorious brightneſſe with

our mortall eies, we can not behold; whoſe woonderous works and manifold mercies the tongs of men can not ſufficientlie declare. Good Lord I yeeld thee moſt humble thanks, for thy ſingular great gifts and benefits beſtowed vpon me a ſinner. Good Lord thou haſt bleſſed me with knowledge, with increaſe and plentie of all things; thou haſt giuen mee friends, health, and reſt, that I ſhould eate my meate with ioie, and praiſe thee in all thy gifts and works. I knowe that I haue no good thing, but it commeth from thee, and oulie for thy mercies ſake, thou haſt ſo regarded me thy ſeruant. Wherefore good Lord, I beſeech thee to graunt me thy grace withall, that I may vſe theſe thy gifts to thy honour and glorie, and the comfort of them that neede; that vſing the talent which thou haſt lent me, I may become a good ſeruant, and obtaine eternall bliſſe, the promiſed hire to ſuch as doo well. Uouchſafe good Lord, for thy ſonne our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt his ſake, to heare my praiers.
                        Almightie God, refreſh me with thy grace, I beſeech thee; comfort me with thy mercie, and bleſſe me; that ſafe from all euils, free from feare of all dangers, in peace and quietneſſe, I may ſing praiſes to thy holie name, and reioice in thee with thine elected for euer and euer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        A praier to be ſaid in time of quietneſſe and prosperitie.
                        
                        
                           GIue vs good Lord, the comfortable & healthfull ſpirit of thy grace and aboundant fauour, that we may without ceaſing make our continuall boaſt of thy praiſe. We know, and from the bottome of our harts confeſſe, that thou haſt dealt more louinglie with vs, than thou haſt done with our next neighbours, whoſe painefull miſeries, and bloudie broiles may be a ſufficient warning vnto

vs, to hate our ſin and iniquitie, leaſt the like calamitie or euer we be aware, do compaſſe and hedge vs round about. Giue vs grace therefore in time of peace and happie proſperitie, ſo to walke, that thy fatherlie bleſſings be not withdrawne nor taken from vs, and the rod of thy ſharpe correction laid vpon our neckes, euen in ſuch ſort as thou haſt viſited our brethren in other countries, whoſe bodies, by the meanes of ciuill diſſention, haue beene made a praie to the ſword.
                        We heare and vnderſtand, that not far off, but euen hard at the gates of our borders, the father is readie in armes to ſeeke the deſtruction of his ſonne: the ſonne is as greedie to gape for the bloud of his father. We heare how violentlie the brother thirſteth after the bloud of his brother, friend is againſt friend, neighbour againſt neighbour, yong men are murthered, old men are ſuddenlie ſlaine, manie a wife is huſbandleſſe, manie a child is deſolate and fatherleſſe. The cruell harted enimie ſpareth none, he maketh hauocke, no teares can ſtaie him from his affectioned tyrannie. The tender infants are haled from the earnefull paps of their weeping mothers, and torne to peece-meale before the ſorowfull eies of their carefull parents. Old age is contemned, godlie matrones are abuſed, virgins are defloured and rauiſhed by violence; a ſpectacle of extreame crueltie for vs to behold, and a glaſſe of great carefulneſſe for vs to looke vpon, that haue worthilie deſerued like or far greater puniſhments.
                        Yet with-holdeſt thou from vs thy ſcourge, although our offences are ſo great and diuers, that might heape vp the ſentence of thine exceeding iuſtice againſt vs. In place of war and bloudie battell, thou haſt giuen vnto vs proſperitie, and perfect peace. In place of penurie, dearth and ſcarſitie, thou haſt giuen vs increaſe, fulneſſe, and great plentie. In ſtead of diſcord and diſſention, thou haſt ſent vs vnitie and concord: and by thy

celeſtiall prouidence we are defended from the cruell enimie, and from the domeſticall and ciuill war. And beſides theſe thy gratious gifts, to heape vp our conſolation and ioie, thou haſt giuen vs thy true and liuelie word, as a lanterne to direct vs, and guide our footeſteps from vanitie to vertue; from wickednes to godlie wiſdome; from licentious libertie to newneſſe of life, and godlie conuerſation. Beſides all theſe thine ineſtimable graces, freelie beſtowed vpon vs, thou haſt giuen vs godlie and zealous Preachers, which plentiouſlie breake vnto vs, out of thine eternall teſtament, the bread of life; whereon good Lord giue our ſoules ſuch power to feede by faith, that they may be nouriſhed to eternall ioie; and we by the diligent obſeruing and obeieng of thy commandements, may be preſerued from all kind of diſſention; and peaceablie enioie the fruits of pure peace & truſtie tranquillitie. Grant this, O mercifull Father, for thy ſon Chriſts ſake, our onelie Sauiour and Redeemer Chriſt Ieſus,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        A godlie and fruitfull praier to be ſaid in time of bloudie battell.
                        
                        
                           O Lord our heauenlie Father, and euerliuing God, we thy wretched and moſt miſerable creatures confeſſe and acknowledge, wee haue woorthilie deſerued the rod of thy correction and puniſhment: and doo merit manie ſharpe and bitter ſtripes, that knowing thy bleſſed and glorious will, haue of ſet purpoſe contemned thy diuine and heauenlie precepts; for which cauſe the ſentence of thy wrath is ſharpelie kindled againſt vs, euen as it hath beene againſt thy choſen people Iſrael, in the daies of our forefathers, who glorieng in their wickedneſſe, were plagued in the fulneſſe of thine indignation. The ſword of their enimies beſet them round about, and hemmed them in on euerie ſide. The Iebuſites,

the Ammonites, the Philiſtines and the Amorites oppreſſed them diuerſelie: their ſtrong holds were raſed, their cities were beſieged, their houſes were ranſacked, their goods and their riches were caried awaie by force of the bloud-thirſtie enimie: their yoong men were led awaie captiue, their virgins were wofullie defloured. But in fine, when thou Lord God didſt behold their hartie and earneſt contrition, thou didſt withdrawe thy frowning countenance, & ſenteſt them ſpeedie and ſafe deliuerance.
                        One while thou Lord ſenteſt them Moſes, to bring them out of the ſeruitude of Pharao, the ſtonie and ſtubborne-harted king of the Aegyptians: another while Iephthah ſet them free from the ſword of the Ammonites, wherewith they were greeuouſlie afflicted: and to make thy power and excellent glorie fullie knowne, thou gaueſt Samſon much fortitude to bridle the proud Philiſtines. Ouer & beſides theſe, thou of thy loue and miraculous goodnes haſt made feeble women mightie and victorious conquerors. Debora was a ſhield to thy people: Iudith comforted the diſtreſſed Bethulians, & cut off the head of proud Holophernes: that thy ſelfe good Lord, when thou beholdedſt their teares, and hartie ſorowe for their offences, didſt prepare thy ſelfe to go foorth with their hoaſts. Thou thy ſelfe, I ſaie, with the breath of thy noſtrils, didſt confound and ouerthrowe their enimies.
                        So good Lord, be thou now preſent with vs in the fulneſſe of thy diuine power: looke vpon vs with the eies of thy fauourable pitie. Forget our corrupt and moſt filthie offences: let our contrite and ſorowfull harts be a meane to vanquiſh thy diſpleaſure conceiued againſt vs: be thou preſent with vs in this time of neceſſitie and trouble: ſet thy hand to helpe and aſſiſt vs againſt the enimie: be thou preſent with vs in this time of perill and danger: go thou foorth with our

hoſts: then ſhall we be aſſured to preuaile: let not the multitude of furious foes diſmaie vs. For victorie we doo knowe conſiſteth not in the power nor ſtrength of manie men, horſes, armour nor weapons; but it is thou, O mercifull Father, that giueſt the conqueſt, where and to whom thou pleaſeſt. To thee therefore in this great extremitie we flie and appeale; beſeeching thee of thine ineſtimable loue and kindneſſe, for the loue of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, to looke vpon our true repentant harts, and in the fulneſſe of thy miſerations and pities, to ſet vs free from the power of the raging enimie, and to pardon our ſinnes and greeuous offences, that hencefoorth we may vow and dedicate our harts and minds wholie to walke in integritie and newneſſe of life: which grant good Lord, to whom with thy ſonne Chriſt Ieſus, and the holie Ghoſt, be praiſe and glorie attributed for euer and euer, world without end,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        A godlie praier to be ſaid in time of anie common plague, priuate affliction or trouble.
                        
                        
                           OEternall and euerliuing God, the Father of all conſolation & comfort, vouchſafe of thine infinite loue and kindneſſe to ſtrengthen mee with thy heauenlie grace, patiently to beare and with meekeneſſe to ſuffer this croſſe of affliction and trouble, which thou haſt laid vpon me for the vſe of ſinne and iniquitie. I knowe, O gratious and louing Father, that my deſerts are ſuch as woorthilie haue prouoked thee to diſpleaſure. The burden of my ſinnes are intollerable, for the which I muſt acknowledge, and earneſtlie from the bottome of my hart confeſſe, that iuſtlie thou haſt corrected and viſited me; yet not in the fulneſſe of thy furie, but according to thy fatherlie loue and kindneſſe. And albeit thy rod lie heauie vpon my ſhoulders; yet in this time of thy correction I

am comforted greatlie, knowing aſſuredlie that thou correcteſt and ſimiteſt where thou loueſt: thou woundeſt, and healeſt againe: thou throweſt downe to hell, and lifteſt vp againe to heauen: ſuch and ſo great is thine omnipotencie, that thou ruleſt aboue the firmament, in earth, flouds, and the lowermoſt parts of hell.
                        In heauen the Angels, Archangels, the ſoules of thy Saints, the bleſſed companie of Martyrs giue thee praiſe, glorie and veneration. The ſun, the moone, and gliſtering ſtars, ech one of them in their courſe and qualitie ſhew themſelues obedient vnto thy will. In earth the beaſts of the field, and the ſeelie feathered foules of the aire in their order ſeeme to ſet foorth thy glorie and praiſe. In the deepe waters the fiſhes of the ſea are readie to obſerue thy will, and in their maner they as thy creatures giue thee due honour and reuerence. But among theſe, man, whom thou by thy diuine will and pleaſure haſt indued with reaſon, and in his creation, concerning the inward man, hadſt faſhioned him to thy ſimilitude and likeneſſe, is now moſt prone and willing to be (by the miniſters of darkneſſe) ſeduced and carried awaie from vertue to vice; from godlineſſe to all impietie; from obedience to wilfull breach and contempt of thy precepts: ſo that diligence is baniſhed by negligence. And ſuch is the power of our fleſh, that our eies, which ſhould haue their chiefeſt contemplation and delight in peruſing and reading thy glorious and ſacred Goſpel (wherein we may behold thee crucified and ſlaine, O ſweeteſt Sauiour Chriſt Ieſus, perfect God and perfect man, by whoſe innocent death & bloudie paſſion, attonement is made betwixt thy Father and vs) are ſo dazeled with the dimme and darke miſts of Sathan, that they are occupied in the beholding of mundane and tranſitorie pleaſures; all which in effect vaniſh and weare awaie, euen as the flower that either is parched by the force

of Phoebus radiant beames, or by Winters ſtormes and horie froſts conſumed.
                        Our eares, which thou haſt giuen to vs to heare, and vnderſtand the ſacred and diuine myſteries conteined in thy holie lawe, are made deafe of purpoſe; ſo that they glorie more in fables and lothſome leaſings, than they conceiue delight in the zealous predication of thine Euangelicall and heauenlie doctrine. Our harts are hardened like the Adamant; ſo that for the greateſt part they can not brooke thy teſtimonies: they continuallie luſt and deſire to be ſatiſfied with worldlie wealth, honour and dignitie. And who beholdeth not in theſe daies, what cruell conflict and bloudie fight there is betwixt good conſcience and filthie auarice, the roote of all miſchiefe and euill? Naie, who ſeeth not in this age, plaine dealing murthered by deceit and faithleſſe fraud? Who now beholdeth not true meaning ſtrangled by forged flatterie and loathſome leaſings? The bowels of compaſſion and pitie are ſhut vp by violent oppreſſion and tyrannie.
                        Our feete are willing to tread the paths of pride, fornication and vncleanneſſe. Our hands are readie to offer wrong and iniurie to the innocent: yea and in fine, whatſoeuer thou haſt giuen vnto vs to ſpread and ſet foorth thy glorie and honour, is by ſinne ſo corrupted, that we make the members of our bodies (which by grace and of pure loue are ingraffed in the bodie of Chriſt, the rich and great ſhepheard of our ſoules) the verie members of Sathan. So that of ſet purpoſe our tranſgreſſion abounding, we flie from Chriſt the rocke and ſtrong piller of our ſaluation; and run head-long to death and vtter deſtruction of bodie and ſoule. Yet like a louing God and mercifull Father, thou calleſt vs home againe by thy word, wherin not onlie thy mercies, but alſo thy terrible threats are thundered foorth againſt vs, for our impenitencie. But when neither

thy manifold mercies, freelie of thine abundant goodneſſe offered vnto vs in Ieſus Chriſt, can mooue nor ſtir vs to handfaſt contrition; neither yet thy terrible comminations and thretnings can reclame nor call vs backe from the dangerous puddle of our ſins: then thou ſendeſt forth thy plagues and puniſhments; as peſtilence, famine & bloudie ſword, intending thereby to driue vs to amendment of life, and to acknowledge thine omnipotencie.
                        But when thou beholdeſt our true repentant harts, our ſobs and ſighing teares powred foorth before the throne of thy diuine Maieſtie; thou withdraweſt from vs the terror of thine indignation and vengeance; the rod of thy correction is laid aſide; thy diſpleaſure iuſtlie conceiued againſt vs for the continuall exerciſe of ſinne, is vtterlie forgotten; and by the interceſſion of thy ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, that ſitteth on thy right hand, in glorie permanent and euerlaſting, like a louing Father, and moſt mercifull God; the ſiluered ſcepter of peace is offered vnto vs, with all other thy gratious benefits; that thine anger is conuerted to clemencie; thy diſpleaſure is turned to louing kindneſſe; and in fine, thine indignation is ſo calmed by thine abundant grace and mercie; that like a louing and gentle Father, thine armes are ſtretched foorth, ioifullie to embrace and receiue vs to thy fauour againe. All this I knowe to be moſt certaine and true. For when, or at what tune ſoeuer we ſhall appeare before the gates of mercie, and by the meanes and power of a conſtant and liuelie faith knocke therat; thou art redie to open vnto vs; not for anie of our deſerts; but for the merits of Ieſus Chriſt, the fulneſſe of thy diuine miſeration, compaſſion and pitie. And whenſoeuer we ſhall call vpon thee, with lowlineſſe and meekeneſſe of our harts and minds, bewailing wofullie our heinous offences committed againſt thee; thine eares are moſt attentiue

to heare, & willinglie doeſt grant vs our petitions.
                        Wherefore, O moſt gratious and louing father, we come vnto thee with ſorowfull and contrite harts, beſeeching thee for the loue of thine annointed ſonne Ieſus Chriſt our Meſſias, Sauiour, and Redeemer, to behold and looke vpon vs with the eies of compaſſion and pitie. And albeit we haue worthilie deſerued this thy plague and puniſhment, yet reſpect thou not our deſeruings, leaſt in thy furie and indignation we be confounded & periſh. Haue an eie rather to thy ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, behold his bloudie wounds, which yet are freſh and greene, and neuer ſtint bleeding. Thinke vpon the bitter and painefull torments that he ſuffered for vs vpon the croſſe, in whoſe name we beſeech thee fauourablie to looke vpon our infirmities, mercifullie to heare our praiers and petitions offered vnto thee, and gratiouſlie for the glorie of thy name ſake, to take and withdrawe from vs this thy heauie rod of correction, which our ſinfull liues, and contempt of thy precepts haue heaped heauilie on our neckes.
                        Giue vs patience to ſuffer whatſoeuer it ſhall pleaſe thee to laie vpon vs. Giue vs grace alwaie to call and crie vpon thy holie and bleſſed name, and faithfullie with teares to ſaie vnto thee continuallie: Spare vs good Lord, ſpare thy people, whom thou haſt redeemed with thy pretious bloud, neither yet good Lord be thou angrie with vs for euer. Graunt this O mercifull father, for the loue of thy onlie ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, to whome with thee and the holie Ghoſt, be all honour, glorie and praiſe aſcribed foreuer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        A praier for patience in trouble, and meekelie to ſuffer aduerſitie.
                        
                        
                           GRatious Lord, and omnipotent God, whoſe mercie is euerlaſting and infinite, bowe downe thine eare, and harken vnto this my praier, which I make before thy diuine Maieſtie,

moſt humblie beſeeching thee, of thine accuſtomed goodneſſe, to indue me with the works of mercie, and deedes of charitie; and aboue all things to giue me patience in aduerſitie, meekelie to ſuffer, and patientlie to take, whatſoeuer it ſhall pleaſe thee to laie vpon me, and neuer to murmur or to grudge thereat, but alwaies to thinke thy louing and gentle correction to be much leſſe, than the deſerts of my great and manifold offences.
                        Againe, if I be not vnder correction, then am I not thy child. For what father is he, who correcteth not his children, whome he moſt intirelie loueth? This then is an euident token that thou loueſt vs, when as thou correcteſt vs. For as the ſcripture ſaith, Whome God loueth, him he chaſteneth. Thou ſeeſt all things, thou vnderſtandeſt and knoweſt all things; ſo that not ſo much as one little ſparowe lighteth vpon the ground, without thy knowledge: yea our verie thoughts are foreknowne vnto thee. Thou diſpoſeſt and ordereſt all things, as ſeemeth beſt to thy holie will and pleaſure. By thy helpe I may doo all things; without thee I can doo nothing. When thou powreſt vpon vs thy creatures, thy good gifts and benefits: when thou beſtoweſt vpon vs proſperitie, health, wealth, and ſuch like, thou dooeſt it to this intent, that we acknowledging the ſame, ſhould thereby be incouraged to ſerue, honour, and humblie obeie thee, and alwaies praiſe and magnifie thy glorious name. Contrariwiſe, when thou ſtrikeſt vs with thy rod of correction, as plaging vs with great mortalitie; ſuffering our enimies to inuade vs; robbers for to ſpoile vs; pouertie to oppreſſe vs; or fire to conſume thoſe things which thou haſt lent vs, for the maintenance of our bodies in this mortall life: thou doeſt it to put vs in mind, that we haue tranſgreſſed thy commandements, that we haue not harkned vnto thee, neither done that which is acceptable

in thy ſight, but willinglie falling into the puddle of ſin, and following our owne appetites, haue prouoked thy iuſt wrath and indignation againſt vs.
                        Thus thou dealeſt with vs, O Lord, to the intent that we ſuffering bodilie puniſhment, and feeling the ſmart of the ſame, may thereby be admoniſhed of our dutie, and with true compunction of hart, deſire to be releaſed from thy ſcourges, which we haue deſerued, and worthilie receiue: and then acknowledge our ſelues to be loſt children, and ſtraieng ſheepe, may both ſee and be aſhamed of our vnbrideled affections and wilfulneſſe, which haue brought vs to calamitie and miſerie, and with the true penitent to ſaie:
                        We are not worthie (moſt mercifull Father) to lift vp our eies or voice vnto thee, for our manifold ſins and wickedneſſe. Neuertheleſſe, preſuming vpon thine aboundant mercie (who refuſeſt none that doo call vppon thee) moſt lamentablie we doo crie, Haue mercie vpon vs O Lord, haue mercie vpon vs miſerable ſinners, being now greeuouſlie afflicted with the burden of puniſhment and affliction, which thou haſt laid vpon vs. Put thou therefore awaie diſpleaſure conceiued againſt vs thy poore creatures, and grant vs, that beeing warned by this, we may euer heereafter ſerue thee in newneſſe of life, and neuer commit anie thing which ſhall diſpleaſe or offend thee.
                        This O heauenlie father, I acknowledge to be our dutie. But though I, for my part, haue not performed the ſame, as I ought to doo; yet I beſeech thine ineſtimable goodneſſe, not to execute the rigour of thy iuſtice vpon me: but to ſtate thine hand, and before thou giue me anie greater wound, to behold my humilitie and repentance, which being not able to recompenſe and ſatiſfie the treſpaſſes, which I againſt thee haue committed; doo offer vnto thee (according as the poore widowe did) all that which I am able to giue, that

is, a ſorowfull contrition of hart for my former offences done and paſſed.
                        Thy iuſtice, as it is right; ſo is it rigorous to ſinners. Thou art ſo gealous, and ſo much doeſt deteſt ſin, that thou ſpareſt not to puniſh thy verie elect and choſen ſeruants, when as they fall into it. Who was more acceptable in thy ſight, than that holie Prophet King Dauid, of whome thou thy ſelfe didſt ſaie, I haue found a man according to mine owne hart, euen Dauid my ſeruant: yet neuertheleſſe, diuers and ſundrie waies didſt thou puniſh him, when that he had ſwarued from thy teſtimonies. Thou ſufferedſt him to be moleſted with the inſurrection of his owne ſonne; thou didſt ſend the prophet vnto him, to offer him the choice of plagues which thou wouldeſt ſend vpon him, for his wicked liuing: but when he with ſorowfull ſighes, and trickling teares turned vnto thee, confeſſing his fault, crauing pardon, and promiſing amendment of life, thou forgateſt thine anger, and forgaueſt his offence.
                        Other of thy choſen veſſels thou haſt permitted to be greeuouſlie tormented, & vexed by ſundrie troubles and aduerſities, onlie to trie their faith and ſtedfaſtneſſe towards thee. As thou didſt ſuffer that patient man Iob, to be moſt cruellie intreated by that enimie of all mankind, to haue his houſes burned and ſpoiled, his cattell taken awaie, his ſeruants driuen into bondage, his children to be ſlaine, his owne bodie to be afflicted with moſt loathſome diſeaſes, plagues and ſores. And all this thou didſt not for anie euill deede of his, but to ſhewe thine omnipotencie and power. For when thou hadſt tried him to the vtmoſt, and found that his enimie the diuell could not preuaile againſt him, or by anie paine and greefe cauſe him to blaſpheame and ſpeake euill of thee, thou diddeſt reduce him to health, thou diddeſt enrich him againe, thou diddeſt reſtore vnto him againe his

children, friends, familie, and all his goods, with much more than euer he before poſſeſſed: ſhewing moſt manifeſtlie, that thou wilt reward them moſt plentiouſlie, which do loue thee, folowe and obſerue thy commandements.
                        Wherefore I beſeech thee to giue me grace, that whatſoeuer waie it ſhall pleaſe thee to viſit me with thy puniſhment, I may take it patientlie, and ſaie with patient Iob; Naked came I into this world, and naked ſhall I returne to the earth againe: the Lord giueth, the Lord taketh awaie, euen as it pleaſeth the Lord, ſo be it. Suffer me not to deſpaire, or to thinke that thou dealeſt vniuſtlie with me, but to ſaie; Shall I receiue proſperitie at the Lords hand, and not to be content with aduerſitie? And alwaie to thinke vpon this, Happie are they whome thou doeſt puniſh. For though thou make a wound, thou alſo giueſt a plaiſter: though thou ſmiteſt, thy hand maketh whole againe. Mine iniquitie is great, but be thou merciful vnto my wickednes. O deliuer me from thine anger, and preſſe me not further than I ſhall be able to beare. But now that I acknowledge that whatſoeuer trouble thou haſt ſent me, or wilt laie vpon me, is either for the puniſhment of mine iniquitie, or for the triall of my conſtancie, I may with repentant Dauid find remiſſion of my ſins, and with patient Iob, releaſe of mine aduerſitie, and obtaine ſuch fauour in thy ſight, that thou neuer againe ſo greeuouſlie puniſh me; but that I may ſo paſſe this life, that I may afterward liue with thee, to whome be honour and glorie for euer and euer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another praier in trouble and aduerſitie.
                        
                           HAue mercie vpon me, O Lord, haue mercie vpon me moſt miſerable creature, which doo that which I ought not, & feare that which I haue moſt iuſtlie deſerued. If I weigh

with my ſelfe the wickedneſſe that I haue done; the puniſhment thereby deſerued is not halfe ſo great, as the ſinne that I haue committed. But thou art a mercifull God, and thy iudgements are right, neither dooeſt thou at anie time puniſh vs vniuſtly. Thou almightie God madeſt vs, when as we were not; and when as we were loſt and damned, thou didſt miraculouſlie reſtore vs. I knowe and I am ſure, that our life is not led by ſudden and vncertaine motions; but is diſpoſed and directed by thee; thou haſt a fatherlie care of vs all, but eſpeciallie of ſuch as doo put their whole truſt and confidence in thy mercie.
                        Therefore I humblie praie and beſeech thee, that thou wouldeſt not deale with me after my deſeruings; but according to thy great mercie, which doth exceede the ſinnes of the whole world. And as often as thou dooeſt puniſh me outwardlie, giue me grace inwardlie with patience to beare the ſame, and that thy praiſe neuer depart out of my mouth. Order my dooings, euen as ſhall be moſt neceſſarie both for my bodie and ſoule. Thou onlie haſt power ouer all things, thou knoweſt all things, to thee be all honour for euer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another praier in trouble, for the obteining of mercie.
                        
                        
                           BEhold, out from the bottome of my hart doo I crie vnto thee, O Lord, beſeeching thee that thou wouldeſt ſaue me from the bottomleſſe pit of hell. I knowe that there is mercie with thee; doo not therefore marke what I haue done amiſſe. Enter not into iudgment with thy ſeruant, for then can I by no meanes be iuſtified in thy ſight. The remembrance of mine offences is greeuous vnto mee, and therefore I right humblie craue pardon thereof. My hart is troubled, my ſoule is vexed, there is no health in my fleſh. Forſake me not mine onlie ſtaie and

comfort: deſpiſe not my contrite hart, open the boſome of thy mercie: take cleane awaie mine iniquitie, bring my ſoule out of tribulation, turne the extremitie of thy iuſtice, into thy tender mercie. And when thou ſhalt come to iudge the quicke and the dead, be not reuenged on me by eternall damnation; but to take mee amongſt thine elect, into the bleſſed ſtate of ſaluation. Grant this, O Father, for Chriſt his ſake, our mediator and aduocate,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another.
                        
                           O Lord my God, although I haue committed that, whereby I am an offender, can I make my ſelfe not to bee thy creature? Though through ſinne I haue loſt my cleanneſſe and puritie; haue I alſo taken awaie thy goodneſſe and mercie? Though I haue committed that, wherefore thou maieſt condemne me; haſt thou not done that, whereby thou maieſt ſaue me? True it is, O Lord, that my conſcience doth ſhew me, that I haue deſerued damnation; but thy mercie exceedeth all offenſion. Spare me, O God, bicauſe it is not vnpoſſible for thy power; it is not vnmeete for thy mercie, it is not vnaccuſtomed, or yet contrarie to thine infinite goodneſſe. Wherefore thou which haſt created me, doo not deſtroie me. Thou, O Ieſu, which haſt redeemed me, doo not condemne me. Thou which haſt made mee, let not thy worke be caſt awaie by my wickedneſſe. Wipe awaie all that is mine, and draweth me from thee; and knowledge all that is thine in me, and may bring mee vnto thee, which liueſt and reigneſt one God in perſons three, to whom be all honour, now and euer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another praier, wherin the penitent longeth for comfort.
                        
                           HOw long, O Lord, wilt thou turne awaie thy face from me? How long wilt thou bee angrie with thy ſeruant? How long ſhall I abide mourning and ſolitarie, as the bird

that hath loſt hir yoong? O Lord thinke on me in thy mercies, and doo not correct me in thy wrath: for then ſhall I become as the duſt and ſmoke in the wind. O Lord forſake not thy ſeruant Iſrael, whom thou haſt choſen. My hart being comforted in thy mercies ſhall reioice, and I will ſing vnto thee, and praiſe thee in thy good works and miracles, which thou haſt done in our fathers time: So be it.
                        
                     
                     
                        Being tempted by the ghoſtlie enimie (as all that feare God are) to doubt in anie article of the Catholike faith, to deſpaire in Gods mercie, to yeeld to melancholie fanſies, to be vexed with vnkindnes of friends, or the malice of enimies, to be troubled with ſickneſſe, or anie other waies oppreſſed with griefe of bodie and mind: ſaie deuoutlie as followeth.
                        
                           I Humblie accept moſt mercifull Ieſus, this heauie temptation, which now I ſuffer at the hands of thy diuine prouidence; and would a greater if thou pleaſe to laie it on me for thy ſake, who haſt ordeined this from the beginning, for the tender loue thou beareſt to the health of my ſinfull ſoule: and I moſt hartilie thanke thee for it. I confeſſe I haue deſerued woorſe for my ſinne and vnkindneſſe towards thee, and am not woorthie to receiue anie comfort or conſolation at thy hands. Therfore to the honour of the paſſion, and death, which thou willinglie ſufferedſt on the croſſe, I offer my ſelfe to ſuſtaine this, or anie other aduerſitie, with all my hart, not ſeeking otherwiſe eaſe or reliefe, than in and by thee, O Lord, and as thy good will and pleaſure ſhall appoint. Yet this one thing I craue and beſeech thee, for the tender loue thou beareſt to me, and all mankind, (for in me is no vertue, or ought that good is) to helpe and aſſiſt me with thy holie ſpirit, as my truſt is thou wilt, who promiſeſt that no man ſhall be tempted more than he ſhall be able to beare. And giue me all

what euer ſhall be neceſſarie, to ſuſtaine with patience this croſſe and temptation, which thy diuine wiſdome hath appointed for me; to the intent that I bearing the ſame willinglie with thee here in this world, may conceiue aſſured hope to be partaker of thy glorie in the world to come. Grant this my requeſt, moſt mercifull Sauiour, not for my merit or deſeruing, but onlie for the merits of thy death and bitter paſſion, I humblie beſeech thee,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        A praier againſt the feare of worldlie caſualties.
                        
                        
                           O Moſt bountifull and louing Father, mine onlie guider and comforter, the well of mercie, the true light of the world, take awaie the darkneſſe of my mind, lighten my hart & ſenſes, indue me with thy grace, arme me ſo ſtronglie with ſure hope, confidence and truſt in thee, that I neuer be driuen into feare, either by the ſubtile inuaſions of our ghoſtlie enimie Sathan, or by the craftie wilineſſe of the world, neither yet by loſſe, damage, hurt or hinderance of anie of thoſe vaine and tranſitorie things, which we in this world doo poſſeſſe: but alwaies whatſoeuer ſhall becom of them, to thinke that they are but things lent, and not our owne, and that we ſhall make a ſtreight account of the vſe or abuſe of them; whereby the more we poſſeſſe thereof, the greater ſhall be our paine, if we abuſe them.
                        Wherefore take from mee all inward heauineſſe, thought and care, for anie loſſe or diſcommoditie receiued by worldlie goods; and alwaies to thinke, that as well pouertie as riches, needineſſe as abundance; ſickneſſe as health; aduerſitie as proſperitie; come from thee: and that it is knowne to thine inſcrutable iudgement onlie, why and wherefore thou ſendeſt either of theſe vpon vs. And therefore let not my mind be troubled

with anie feare of things to chance, (ſauing onlie to feare to diſpleaſe thee:) but alwaies to be merrie in thee with ſobernes, and to caſt all my care of worldlie affaires vpon thee; foraſmuch as thou haſt commanded that we ſhould not be carefull what to eate, or what to drinke, or with what raiment we ſhall be clothed. For thou wilt not ſee the righteous forſaken, or their children begging their bread; and that thou turneſt all things to the beſt to them that ſerue thee, and flie vnto thee for ſuccour, in the time of their diſtreſſe.
                        Let this, O Lord, be euermore freſh in my memorie, grauen in my hart; and readie in my mouth: ſo that I leauing all needleſſe feare, may alwaies giue thanks vnto thee, and praiſe thy holie name,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        A praier to be deliuered from enimies and dangers.
                        
                        
                           O Moſt mightie Lord God of Abraham, Iſaac and Iacob, which didſt leade the children of Iſrael through the red ſea, and madeſt the ſtreames of Iordan runne backe into their ſprings againe, that thy people might paſſe through the midſt thereof. Good Lord, whoſe heaſts the flouds obeied; at whoſe voice the hils doo leape, and the earth doth tremble. O moſt mightie Lord, which canſt deſtroie the proudeſt kings with verie flies and ants: which madeſt little Dauid to triumph on the giant Goliah, which deliueredſt his enimie king Saule into his hands: gaueſt Gedeon thy ſeruant, with his few ſouldiours, victorie of ſo manie legions of ſtrong men. Thou which haſt ſubdued ſo manie mightie kings, and ſundrie nations, vnto thy people Iſrael. O God, which workeſt all in all things, which giueſt victorie alwaies as ſeemeth beſt to thine vnſearchable wiſdome: defend me alwaies, I beſeech thee, againſt mine enimies, and all euils; that my ſhip toſſed and beaten in the waues

of this world, may reſt in thy happie hauen of euerlaſting ioie for euer.
                        My ſoule cleaueth vnto thy mercie, as to an holie ſanctuarie. O God, if thou ſhouldeſt not be mercifull, who could abide the heat of thy diſpleaſure? But thou O Lord, art good to thy ſeruants: and I hope to ſee thy goodneſſe in the land of the liuing. All glorie be to the moſt high and mercifull God, for euer and euer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        A praier for righteous iudgement, in matters of controuerſie.
                        
                        
                           O Lord God of all iuſtice, which in equall ballance dooeſt weigh the cauſe of the Prince and of the pooreſt man, which deſpiſeſt not the ſuites of the ſimple, which deliuereſt the captiue, and comforteſt the deſolate and carefull. O Lord, which haſt bleſſed them that are poore in ſpirit: releeue thy ſeruant oppreſſed with griefe, remooue from me the clouds of my ſorowes. O Lord, ſtretch forth thy mightie hand, and helpe me. Let me not ſinke in the ſeas of ſlander and ſhame. Thou knoweſt the ſecrets of my hart: defend me in mine innocencie, pleade thou my cauſe againſt the vngodlie, which haue laid their net for me. O God, thou which haſt deliuered Ioſeph, Daniel, Mardocheus & Suſanna, from captiuitie and inſtant death; and didſt cloth them with honour: good Lord ſtrengthen me, and be my defender againſt all euils: and let not the poiſoned arrowes of malicious tongues doo me anie harme. Grant theſe my praiers, good Lord, I beſeech thee, for our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt his ſake,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        A Pſalme to be ſaid after trouble eſcaped.
                        
                           MY ſoule reioice in God, for he is my light, and my defence, my helpe, the lanterne to my feet. He hath heard my praier, when I called on him, he hath holpen me in my neede, he hath

deliuered me in my dangers. The Lord is the keeper of my life, from whome ſhall I ſhrinke; whome ſhall I feare? Lieng proſtrate at the feete of my Lord, I bewailed my caſe, and he heard my plaint; he forſaketh not his ſeruants. Wherefore, if armies of men ſtood vp againſt me, I ſhould not feare. For if God be on my ſide, who can preuaile againſt me? He is happie and ſafe, whome God, the mightie God of Iſrael keepeth. The Sun ſhall not burne him by daie, nor the Moone by night. Chriſe bleſſed is he that feareth the Lord, for he ſhall ſee happie daies. As the Hart thirſteth after the water ſprings, ſo my ſoule hath longed for my Lord, the liuing God. When ſhall I come to appeare before thy preſence, to ſee thee in thy glorious maieſtie, face to face? O Lord let thy kingdome come. Come Lord Ieſus, that I may ſee the daie of my redemption. Good Lord make haſt to helpe me. All glorie, maieſtie, and empire, be vnto God the Creator, God the Redeemer, and God the holie Comforter, for euer and euer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Comfortable exhortations againſt the manifold aſſaults of Sathan.
                        
                        
                           IF thou perceiue that the ſtorme of temptation doth verie often and greeuouſlie aſſault thee, diſmaie not therefore thy ſelfe, neither be diſpleaſed with thy ſelfe, as though almightie God nothing regarded thee; but rather thank him that he inſtructeth and teacheth thee, as one to be his heire; that he puniſheth and correcteth thee, as his moſt deere ſoune; that he prooueth and aſſaieth thee as his welbeloued freend. It is a manifeſt and great token, that man is reiect from the mercie and fauour of God, when he is troubled with no temptation.
                        In thy temptation remember the holie Apoſtle S. Paule, which being rapt to the myſteries of the third heauen, was vexed with the Angel of Sathan.

Remember the temptation of the holie man Iob, and other which were greeuouſlie troubled with their offences. O happie and fortunate man, in whome this earthlie Adam is ſo mortified and ſubdued, that it in no wiſe reſiſteth the ſpirit! But whether this perfect quietneſſe may be in anie, I will not affirme; peraduenture it is not neceſſarie to be. For Paule in this life, notwithſtanding his high perfection and grace, had a motion of the fleſh to vexe and trouble him. And when he thriſe deſired God to be deliuered from the ſaid motion, he onelie had this anſwere: Paule, my grace is ſufficient, for vertue is made perfect by vexation. Paule was vexed by pride, that he ſhould not be proud: to be perfect and ſtrong in God, he was cauſed to be weake and feeble. For he caried the treaſure of heauenlie reuelation in a fraile and brittle veſſell, that the honour and victorie ſhould onlie be in God, not in himſelfe. This one example of Paule, is erudition and learning in manie things, when that we be entiſed and moued to ſinne, that we diligentlie call to almightie God by praier.
                        Remember that Dauid the Prophet, King Salomon, and Peter the Apoſtle, notwithſtanding they were great lights and examples of holineſſe, yet they fell into greeuous and great ſinnes, whome almightie God peraduenture ſuffered to fall for this cauſe, ſpeciallie that thou ſhouldſt not deſpaire. Lift vp thy ſelfe therefore vpon thy feete, and with high courage, and bold ſtomach returne againe into battell againſt thy enimies, not onlie more fierce and bold, but alſo more ware and diligent. And thinke with thy ſelfe what intollerable and inuincible temptations Chriſt ſuffered for thee; wherein there appeared no helpe, comfort, aide, nor defence anie where; wherein God and the whole world ſeemed to be his moſt cruell and malicious enimies, when that he cried alowd, My GOD,

my GOD, why haſt thou forſaken me? Trulie this was a moſt greeuous, painefull, and bitter temptation, which Chriſt ſuffered for vs, that he might make the waie of the croſſe eaſie for vs.
                        Therefore prepare thy ſelfe patientlie to drinke of that cup, which Chriſt Ieſu thy head hath ſo willinglie dronke on, for the ſaluation of all mankind. And ſeeing therefore that Chriſt ſo willinglie put himſelfe in ſubiection, and dipped himſelfe in thoſe ſo horrible and intollerable ſorowes and calamities (our moſt louing and heauenlie father willing the ſame out of doubt,) he alſo vnderſtandeth and knoweth our infirmitie: out of doubt he taking compaſſion on vs, will not extremelie deale with vs; but will rather beare with our imbecillitie and weakeneſſe. Doth not he himſelfe calling all men vnto him ſaie? Come vnto me all yee that labour and are heauie laden, and I will refreſh you. What greater comfort I praie you can be giuen vs? How could Chriſt ſpeake more mercifullie vnto vs?
                        There be manie things that greeuouſlie vexe and trouble man, but what thing can more cruellie vexe and torment his conſcience ouerwhelmed with ſinne, than when he doubteth of the mercie of God? When he dreadeth leaſt God be his aduerſarie, and will reiect him? When he is not able to conceiue this faith of his mercie; and doth imagine himſelfe to be caſt awaie, as a drie member that is cut off?
                        Be preſent heere, O Ieſus Chriſt with thine aide and helpe; heere we haue neede of thy comfort: let not this blacke, violent and horrible tempeſt of troubles ouerthrowe and drowne wretched man.
                        But there is no cauſe why we ſhould doubt. Chriſt is true, he will make his promiſe to appeare, he will helpe vs and refreſh vs. Therefore, whereas thy faith is not ſtrong ynough; whereas thou feeleſt thy ſelfe to doubt of Gods mercie; and haſt well-neere no faith

at all; ſtreightwaies call vpon God; bewaile thy miſerie and lacke of beleefe before him; ſeeke for his aide and ſuccour by feruent praier, and he will both helpe and refreſh thee; he hath taken vpon him thus to doo, and he will bring it to paſſe.
                        But take heede thou ceaſe not to call vpon God; beſeech thou, without ceaſing, the father of all conſolation and comfort, with ſighes from the bottome of thine heart, that he turne not his face from thee: laie thy weakeneſſe vpon him, and powre out into his boſome all things which trouble and torment thee. Crie out with his diſciples; O Lord increaſe my faith. Likewiſe ſaie thou with the father of the lunatike childe; Lord, I beleeue, helpe thou mine vnbeleefe; make haſte O Lord to helpe me, before that I oppreſſed with this weight be drowned. O moſt louing and moſt mercifull father; Lord God of my health, our onlie helpe and refuge: enter not into iudgement with thy ſeruants. Chriſt is my righteouſneſſe, redemption and innocencie, which ſuffered moſt bitter and cruell death for my ſake. Let thoſe things moue thee O father of all compaſſion; haue mercie vpon me for thy ſonnes ſake; confirme and ſtrengthen my hart by faith in Chriſt; comfort me with the conſolations of the holie Ghoſt, that I may enioie the true ioies of euerlaſting life, through the merits of my Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt: to whom with the Father and the holie Ghoſt, be all praiſe and glorie for euer and euer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        A godlie meditation of the vnſpeakable ioies of heauen, and the intollerable paines of hell, verie often to be remembred.
                        
                           O God, my Lord, my harts delight, with whom my ſoule longeth to dwell in that heauenlie Ieruſalem; wherein is continuall health, eternall felicitie, happie libertie, and perfect

bleſſedneſſe; where men ſhall be like vnto the Angels of God, and iuſt men ſhall ſhine as the Sunne, in the euerlaſting kingdome, wherein is no heauineſſe, no ſorrowe, no greefe, no feare, no labour, no death, no diſeaſe, no lacke, no hunger, no thirſt, no cold, nor heate; no wearineſſe of faſting, nor temptation of the enimie, no will to ſinne, nor power to doo euill, no old age, no lame or deformed perſon, no feare of pouertie, or weakneſſe by diſeaſe; but a quiet harbour of all ioie, and euerlaſting happineſſe, where men in the ſocietie of Angels, ſhall continuallie dwell without anie infirmitie of the fleſh. For there is infinite ioie, and eternall bliſſe, from whence none ſhall be remoued, that once by thy prouidence ſhall enter therein.
                        There is reſt from labours, peace from the enimie, a new kind of ioie and delight, ſuch as no hart can conceine, ſaue onlie by taking a maruellous delight, and exceeding pleaſure in the beholding of thee my Lord God, my glorious redeemer, and the heauenlie comforter, which proceedeth from the Father and the Sonne. O heauenlie Ieruſalem, thou art ſweet and beautifull in all thy ioies and delights! There are no ſuch miſeries in thee, as we feele and ſuffer in this poore and miſerable life. There is in thee no darkeneſſe, nor change of time: the ſhining of the Moone; the twinkling brightneſſe of the Stars giueth not light in thee: but onlie the God of all power, glorie & maieſtie, the light of lights. For in thee the Sun of iuſtice giueth light to thoſe that are adopted in his bloud to euer-during bleſſedneſſe.
                        The bright and immaculate Lambe, a moſt beautifull light is thy light, that doth illuminate his choſen children. The King of kings is in the middeſt of thee, enuironed on ech ſide with his beloued Saints, and redie to crowne them with euerlaſting glorie. In thee are legions of Angels, ſinging of ſweet Hymnes and

ſongs, that ſet foorth the praiſe and honor of thy name: in thee are the felowſhip of heauenlie citizens: in thee reſteth the ſweete ſolemnitie of all ſuch as returne from this miſerable pilgrimage vnto thy glorie; the companie of the Prophets, Apoſtles, and victorious armie of Martyrs; holie men and women, which haue vanquiſhed the pleaſures of the world, haue their abiding with thee. There are yoong children and maidens, which haue paſſed ouer their daies in holineſſe of life, publiſhing thy praiſe in all puritie and pietie. Euerie one reioiceth in his degree, though not equall in glorie, yet like in ioies and gladneſſe. For there reigneth perfect charitie, & God is all in all, whoſe Maieſtie without end they ſee continuallie, and ſtill in beholding him their loue increaſeth.
                        Of this eternall bleſſedneſſe the holie Apoſtle Peter had as it were a ſhadowe, or a taſt, vpon the mount Thabor, at the tranſfiguration of Chriſt, from whence he deſired he might not depart. Paule alſo had a proofe of it, when he was rapt or taken vp into the third heauen, where he heard words, and ſawe things ſo maruellous and ſecret, as far paſſeth all mans vnderſtanding, and ſuch as were not to be told or reuealed vnto men. Moſes his face became ſo bright, through the conuerſation that he had with the diuine glorie vpon mount Sinai; that the Iſraelites could not abide it. What then ſhall become of vs, when perpetuallie with thee (which art the Lord of all glorie) we ſhall be conuerſant, after the maner of thy children and familiar friends? Who is he then, that will not ſeeke and deſire by all meanes poſſible, to be a dweller there; both for the deſire of peace, ioie and eternitie; and for the perfect ſight of God?
                        Contrariwiſe, who is able to expreſſe the torments appointed for the vngodlie and vnrepentant liuers; in that deadlie place called Hell, which Sathan himſelfe

abhorreth? What other thing can be there, but continuall paines, eternall tribulation, and infinite calamitie, repleat with all euils? There dwell wicked and ouglie Angels, whoſe horrible lookes bring ſudden feare, greeuous paines, and fearefull death, with continual clouds of euer-during darknes. There is nothing but howling, wailing, lamentation and mourning without all end; fearfull ſcriches, & confuſed cries are there in all places ſuddenlie raiſed. There the woorme of conſcience neuer dieth: in that damnable dungeon, there is fire vnquenchable, and perpetuall gnaſhing of teeth. The miſerable ſoule findeth there no reſt, but is afflicted with all kind of torments, and ſuch as can neuer be expreſſed; all which endure for euer.
                        Alas, little auaileth it thoſe that are ſubiected as firebrans of hell, to crie vnto the Lord: for he will not heare them. Then ſhall they knowe, that all things which they had in this life are vaine; and ſuch things as they thought to be pleaſant, to be found more bitter than gall or poiſon. Then where is the pleaſure of the fleſh, ſo termed falſlie? For there is none other pleaſure, but to feare the Lord. Then ſhall they confeſſe and ſaie, that the iudgement of God is true and righteous, ſaieng: Did we not heare of this, and yet would not be conuerted from our wicked deeds? But then ſhall nothing preuaile. No ſorowe can find comfort; no complaints, anie remorſe; no torments, eaſe; nor painfull paſſions an end: ſuch and ſo exceeding are the vexations of the ſecond death, wherewith all the bodies and ſoules of the vnrighteous ſhall for euer be enuironed.
                        Sith therefore, O heauenlie Father, and moſt gratious God, it ſeemeth good to thine eternall wiſdome, by the knowledge of thine euerlaſting truth, to giue me knowledge of thine ineſtimable mercie offered freelie

vnto me in Ieſus Chriſt my mercifull Sauiour, in whoſe bloudie death and painfull paſſion I am aſſured of eternall life and bleſſedneſſe. Giue me grace to print in my remembrance thy manifold mercies, that feeding my ſoule by faith in thee, I may attaine vnto thoſe endleſſe ioies, that thou haſt prepared for thine adopted ſonnes and choſen children, in the kingdome of euerlaſting righteouſneſſe: and ſo eſcape thoſe euerlaſting torments, which thou haſt prepared for the diuell and his Angels. From the which place of wofull vexation and endleſſe miſerie, deliuer me O heauenlie Father, for the loue of Ieſus Chriſt his ſake, to whom with thee and the holie Ghoſt, be all laud and praiſe for euer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        A praier to be ſaid of the ſicke, at the houre of death.
                        
                        
                           MOſt mightie art thou, O Lord, in all thy deeds, and moſt holie in all thy waies. Bleſſed be the name of my father, my God, and glorious Creator; who by his diuine power, and celeſtiall prouidence, of nothing made all things, fiſh, fleſh, foules, fruites, trees, hearbes, and all other things, whatſoeuer are conteined both in heauen, earth, ſeas, and the nethermoſt parts thereof. Man, concerning the outward parts, thou by thy celeſtiall prouidence and fatherlie bountie, framedſt and createdſt of claie; but concerning the inward ſubſtance of thy creature man, thou didſt faſhion and make him euen according to thine owne ſimilitude and likeneſſe. Moreouer, ſuch and ſo great was thy loue and good will towards him, that all the creatures, or works of thy creation ſerued to this vſe. In earth thou madeſt him lord and king ouer the fruits thereof: the beaſts of the field, the foules of the aire, and the fiſhes of the little flouds and great waters. In the firmament

thou haſt placed the gliſtering Sunne, with his orient beames to giue him light by daie, and therewith thou haſt giuen him the Moone and the ſtarres to gouerne him by night. For the which cauſe, aboue all other the works of thy creation, man ſhould and ought of right to giue thee that glorie, that to thee belongeth.
                        But alas, ſuch and ſo great is the corruption of our fraile and ſinfull fleſh, that for all theſe thy graces wee are carried awaie from thee, and enter into contempt of thy precepts. For which cauſe thou oftentimes dooſt correct and puniſh vs, to the intent we might thereby (feeling thy rod of correction) be driuen to imbrace hartie and true repentance. But when thy threats, and the ſtripes of thy diſpleaſure laid vpon vs, can not take place amongſt vs: thou oftentimes giueſt vs vp to folowe our luſts and affections: but at laſt, when thou dooeſt behold our enormities, thou in a moment, by the power of thy diuine iuſtice, reſtraineſt the rope of our diſordered libertie, and cutteſt in ſunder the bridle of our voluptuouſnes, either by ſudden death, ſword, fire, famine, ſickneſſe, or other the diuine ſentences of thy conceiued ire; to the intent that other thy creatures might, by the terrour of thy iuſtice, auoid ſinne, and learne to amend their liues, leaſt they fall into the like calamitie or danger.
                        True, and moſt true it is, good Lord, that by the exerciſe of ſinne we are the children of death and deſtruction: but by grace of the almightie and victorious conquerour ſweete Ieſus Chriſt, we are the adopted ſonnes of thy Father, and made fellowe-heires with thee our perfect Emanuel. In whoſe name with all humilitie and lowlineſſe of hart and mind, I come vnto thee in this great extremitie of ſickneſſe and danger of death; beſeeching thee to be preſent with me, to forget mine offences, to thinke vpon thy mercies. And although I haue not deſerued ſo much as the leaſt drop

of thy fauour, by meanes of the great burden of my ſinnes, which are in the preſence of thy diuine Maieſtie, moſt ouglie and loathſome to behold: yet reſpect thou not, O Father, mine iniquitie; but haue an eie, I beſeech thee, to the merits of my Sauiour Chriſt Ieſus, to whom as my Mediator, Sauiour and Redeemer, I appeale: who hath promiſed comfort and ſweete conſolation to all thoſe, that in his name flie vnto thee for releefe.
                        I confeſſe that woorthilie thou haſt viſited me with this ſickneſſe and diſeaſe, and yet not according to the multitude of my ſinnes; but in the fulneſſe of miſeration and fatherlie pitie. Giue me grace therefore in theſe bitter brunts of death, who vehementlie at this preſent beginneth to combat with fainting and feeble life, conſtantlie to cleaue vnto thee. Let not the pleaſures of this wicked world be a let or impediment for me to come vnto thee: let not my fraile and feeble fleſh ſubiect to ſinne, which hath through my tranſgreſſion made me a bondman to death, mooue me to deſpaire in thy great mercie: neither yet let the caueling aduerſarie, the enimie of mankind, at my laſt end, triumph ouer me. Giue me patience to ſuffer, and gladlie to beare and abide this thy ſcourge and viſitation; and ſo fortifie me in ſoule and bodie, that ſo long as life ſhall endure in me, I may neuer ceaſe to call vpon thy holie and bleſſed name. Yea and when death is moſt buſieſt, make thou me moſt conſtant: yea when he ſeeketh moſt ſtronglie to aſſaile my feeble bodie; giue me thy grace, good Lord, that I may in ſpirit, hart, mind, and all the powers of my ſoule, giue praiſes vnto thee, that of thy grace and ineſtimable kindneſſe, haſt ſent thy ſonne Chriſt Ieſus to ranſome me, by his bloudie death and paſſion, from the power of hell.
                        Giue me grace therfore, now that thou haſt appointed thy meſſenger death to finiſh the daies of my pilgrimage,

and to call me by his ſummons from out of this vale of miſerie and wretchedneſſe, to build ſtedfaſtlie vpon him, and faithfullie to hope for life and ſaluation, in & alone through him. Let the remembrance of my former wickedneſſe be no more thought vpon: let mine offences be blotted out of thy glorious ſight. Behold my ſorowfull & true repentant hart, which come vnto thee with teares, not building on my merits; but vpon thy mercies. Though I be ſinfull; thy ſonne my Sauiour is righteous: though I be wicked; yet he is moſt holie: though I be full of impietie; yet he is full of all goodneſſe: though I haue greeuouſlie offended thee; yet he hath fullie contented thee: though I haue tranſgreſſed thy lawe; yet he hath fulfilled the ſame, and hath promiſed in his bloud, to waſh awaie their ſinnes, that by faith continue in him conſtant to the end. I therefore, in this my great and painfull agonie, beholding death to be at the gates of my bodie, come vnto thee, by the vertue of a fruitfull faith; beſeeching thee, when thou ſhalt ſee it meete and conuenient, that he ſhall diſſolue the bands of this vading life, which endureth but a while (for a thouſand yeeres are as yeſterdaie in thy ſight) to take my ſoule into thy glorious and bleſſed hands; and ſo to confirme me in thy truth, that at the laſt, when it ſhall pleaſe thee, by the ſound of a trumpe, to raiſe my bodie from the graue, when and in which time bodie and ſoule ſhall vnite and come before thy preſence, I may by faith in thee paſſe ouer the mount of my corruption, ſhake off the bands of ſinne, be ſet free from death and deſtruction; and being by the vertue of thy righteouſneſſe made holie, I may triumph with happie victorie ouer ſinne, death, and all the powers of hell, and enter with thee, and the felowſhip of thy choſen Saints, into euerlaſting reſt. Grant this, moſt louing Father, for Chriſt Ieſus ſake, to whom with thee and the holie Ghoſt, be rendred all

laud, glorie, honour and praiſe, for euer, Amen.
                        
                        The Lord God be mercifull to me; pardon and forgiue me my ſinnes, looke vpon me with his gratious and bleſſed countenance: preſerue me from the ſecond death, and euerlaſting deſtruction of bodie and ſoule. The Lord God iuſtifie me in his death and bloud; cloath me with his euerlaſting righteouſneſſe; and regiſter my name in the booke of life. The Lord God comfort my guiltie conſcience with the euerlaſting light of his bountifull fauour; and lot my place among his Saints in his heauenlie kingdome. The Lord God for his mercies ſake, after this my bodilie death, giue me the fruition of his preſence, in his rich palace of endleſſe glorie, to whoſe mercifull protection I commend with all humilitie and reuerence my ſoule. Lord Ieſus preſerue me, Lord Ieſus comfort me, Lord Ieſus refreſh me, Lord Ieſus praie for me. For onlie into thy hands that haſt redeemed mee, O Lord God of truth, I commend my ſoule,

Forget that through pride I haue prouoked thee to ire; and fauourablie harken vnto my praier. What is Ieſus, but a Sauiour? Therefore O bountifull Ieſu, be thou my Sauiour, riſe vp in thine owne ſtrength to helpe me. Saie vnto my ſoule, I am thy ſafegard. In thy goodneſſe doo I truſt, in thee is my helpe. And foraſmuch as thou haſt willed, that we ſhould without ceaſing ſeeke and ſue vnto thee; behold, I beeing counſelled and foretold by thy commandements, doo now both aſke, ſeeke, and knocke. But thou which commandeſt me to aſke; graunt that I may receiue: thou

biddeſt me ſeeke; make me to find: thou haſt taught me to knocke; open vnto me that ſtand knocking: ſtrengthen me that am weake; reſtore me that am loſt; reuiue me that am dead by ſinne; make me to ſerue thee, to liue to thee, to giue my ſelfe wholie to thee. I knowe my God, that becauſe thou madeſt me, I owe my ſelfe vnto thee: and for that thou haſt redeemed me, I ſhould owe thee more than my ſelfe. But behold, I haue no more to giue, neither can I giue my ſelfe vnto thee, vnleſſe thou make me willing therevnto. Take thou me, draw me vnto thee, that as I am thine by creation, ſo I may be thine by following of thee, which liueſt and reigneſt for euer and euer,
                        Amen.

I beſeech thee, O mercifull father, let it be far from my thought, wilfullie, or of a ſet purpoſe,

to fall into the danger of ſinne, or to commit anie heinous ſinne, or greeuous wickednes againſt thine eternall maieſtie. For by the exerciſe of ſuch and ſo great euill, I by meanes of my preſumption prouoke thee to diſpleaſure. Giue me grace therefore to ſtand in awe of thy iuſtice, leaſt that thy mercie be with-held and kept from me, and thou giue me ouer, as thou didſt proud Pharao, to the luſt and affections of mine owne hart, and ſo I be drowned in the dangerous gulph of deſtruction.

But yet O mercifull father, of thine abundant loue, fauour, and exceeding kindneſſe, giue me grace to renounce ſinne, to hate this tranſitorie and vading world, to mortifie my fraile and feeble fleſh, which rebelleth againſt the ſpirit, and by faith in Chriſt, in this my dangerous pilgrimage, ſo giue me ſtrength, that mine enimies may be ouerthrowne, and I being deliuered from the ſnares of hell, may by thee, which art the author of mans felicitie, haue the fruition of thy kingdome, and celeſtiall manſion of endleſſe and ſempiternall glorie.

holie lawe, that with all the powers of my ſoule, hart, mind and vnderſtanding, I may giue thee continuall praiſe, honor and glorie.

Giue me grace then with praier, to exerciſe ſuch faſting, as may hold downe the man of ſinne, that he ſwell not in pride, exceſſe, gluttonie, or ſuperfluous

Make me alwaies to vſe thy gifts ſo moderatelie, that thy name may be glorified; and I faſting from ſinne with hartie praier faithfullie, may beate at the gates of thy grace, and ſo obtaine the full effects of thy fatherlie loue and fauourable kindneſſe. Finallie, abate I beſeech thee, the pride of the vngodlie that trouble me. Confound in thy iuſtice the imaginations of the fooliſh, which ſticke not to ſaie in their harts, There is no God. Breake the iawe bones of thoſe in ſunder, that conſult and take counſell togither how they may harme the innocent and weake. From the bloud-thirſtie and deceiptfull man, deliuer me O Lord my God. Looke fauourablie vpon me, glad thou my hart with the cheerefull lookes of thy gratious and louing countenance. Saie vnto my ſoule, I am thy ſafegard.

Giue mee grace and power therefore to conſider that all worldlie things are vaine, and ſhall vaniſh awaie like ſmoke. Make me to vnderſtand that I am a ſtranger heere, and far from my countrie, the new Citie of Ieruſalem, which thou haſt in the fulneſſe of thy great mercie ordeined for thoſe, that continue faithfull in thee to the end. And ſith that all earthlie things are ſubiected to conſuming, as meere vanities, endue me with ſuch vnderſtanding, that I may laie my treaſure plentifullie in heauen, with Ieſus Chriſt; to whome in the water of baptiſme by grace in ſpirit, I am coupled and knit. Withdrawe me therefore from the delight of worldlie

pleaſures, and giue me ſtreugth to offer my ſelfe vp wholie into his bleſſed and heauenlie hands, that my hart, my mind, the powers of my ſoule, and all that I haue, may depend on him, with whome my treaſure reſteth, that being vnder the comfortable gard of his defence, I may be deliuered from all danger of bodie and ſoule. Naked was I borne, and naked to the graue ſhall I returne againe; the Lord giueth, and the Lord taketh awaie, euen as it pleaſeth his maieſtie, all things are brought to paſſe, whoſe glorious name be praiſed for euer. No man can eſcape the ſting of death, all fleſh muſt bow vnto the graue. Giue me a feruent faith therefore, O Lord, to continue faithfull in Ieſus Chriſt, that whenſoeuer it ſhall pleaſe thee to ſend thy meſſenger death to arreſt me, I may be readie at his ſummons, ioifullie to beare his ſtroke, and by the power of a liuelie faith, ſo to withſtand ſinne and Sathan, that death may with the enimies of mans felicitie, be vanquiſhed and ſubdued, and I by him may liue in Ieſus Chriſt.

Take from me all abuſe, let me neuer blaſpheme thy bleſſed and glorious name, let my tong be purged by thee from all corrupt and vncomelie talke, let all my thoughts be occupied in thy ſeruice, faith, feare and loue. Make me good Lord alwaies obedient to doo thy will, and to walke in the waies of thy commandements, and to delight in thy bleſſed teſtimonies. And graunt me thy grace, that by the hearing of thy Euangelicall and heauenlie doctrine, my faith may be increaſed, made ſtrong and fruitfull, to exerciſe the works of charitie and loue to all men; and chieflie to

thoſe that conſtantlie fauour thy Goſpell, and continue faithfull in Chriſt Ieſus. Euermore (I ſaie) good Lord, giue me thy bleſſings from aboue, and let my hart, my ſoule and tong, be euer readie, for thy gratious benefits receiued, to publiſh and ſet foorth thy glorie and praiſe in weale and wo, in pouertie, and proſperitie, in time of peace and in time of danger. Stretch foorth thy hand to protect me; and I by thee deliuered from all perils, ſhall make my boaſt of thy mercies freelie ſhowne vnto me without my deſerts; and with the felowſhip of thy Saints, giue ſuch honour, praiſe, and reuerence vnto thee, as of right and bounden dutie I ought to doo.
                           And foraſmuch as not euerie one that ſaith Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the kingdome of God and Chriſt, make me not then a profeſſor of thy word with my lips, but an earneſt louer of the ſame, & a faithfull folower of thy commandements, leaſt at the comming of the great and rich Bridegroome Ieſus Chriſt, I be refuſed, as were the fiue vndiſcreet and fooliſh virgins, that wanted oyle to garniſh their Lamps.

                        The praier that maiſter Bradfords morher ſaid and offered vnto God in his behalfe, a little before his martyrdome.
                        
                           AH good Father, which dooeſt vouchſafe that my ſonne Iohn Bradford, being a greeuous ſinner in thy ſight, ſhould find this fauour with thee, to be one of thy ſonne Chriſt his captaines and men of war, to fight and ſuffer for his Goſpels ſake, I thanke thee: and praie thee in the ſame thy deere ſonne Chriſts name, that thou wouldeſt forgiue him his ſinnes and vnthankfulneſſe; and make perfect in him that good which thou haſt begun in him. Yea Lord, I praie thee make him worthie to ſuffer, not only impriſonment, but euen verie death for thy truth, religion, and Goſpell ſake. As Hanna did applie, dedicate, and giue hir firſt child and ſonne Samuel vnto thee: euen ſo doo I deere Father; beſeeching thee, for Chriſts ſake, to accept this my gift; and giue my ſonne Iohn Bradford grace alwaies trulie to ſerue thee, and thy people, as Samuel did;
                        Amen: Amen.
                     
                  
                  
                     Other godlie praiers taken out of the Pſalmes, written by a godlie harted Gentlewoman.
                     
                        
                           POnder my words, O Lord, conſider my meditation: O harken thou vnto the voice of my wofull mourning, my King and my God: for vnto thee will I make my praier. Heare my voice, O Lord betimes: earlie in the morning will I direct my praier vnto thee, for thou art the God that haſt no pleaſure in wickedneſſe:

neither ſhall anie euill dwell with thee. Thou hateſt all them that worke vanitie: leade me therefore in thy righteouſneſſe, O Lord; for I am weake, and without thee I haue no ſtrength at all: therfore, O Lord God, rebuke me not in thine indignation, neither chaſten me in thy heauie diſpleaſure. Haue mercie vpon me, O Lord, and deliuer my ſoule. Oh ſaue me, for thy mercie ſake. I am almoſt wearie of my groning. Euerie night waſh I my bed, and water my couch with my teares. O Lord my God, in thee haue I put my truſt: ſaue mee from all them that perſecute me, and deliuer me. O Lord my God, if I haue done anie ſuch thing, as is laid to my charge; or if there be anie ſuch wickedneſſe in me; then let mine enimie perſecute my ſoule, and take me captiue. Haſt not thou, O Lord my God, defended me from ſuch vngodlineſſe? Oh how long wilt thou hide thy ſelfe from me thy poore afflicted ſeruant? Oh how long ſhall I ſeeke comfort in my ſoule, and be ſo vexed in my hart? Yea how long ſhall mine enimies triumph ouer me? Conſider and heare me, O Lord my God, lighten mine eies that I ſleepe not in death: leaſt mine enimies ſaie, I haue preuailed againſt him. For if I be caſt downe, then they that trouble me will reioice at it. But my truſt is in thy mercie, O Lord, and my hart is ioifull in thy ſaluation. For after a ſtorme thou makeſt the weather faire, and ſtill after weeping and heauineſſe thou giueſt great ioie. Thy name, O moſt mightie God, be praiſed for euer and euer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another praier.
                        
                           O Lord conſider my meditation, and complaining. Oh harken thou vnto my praiers that go not out of fained lips. Let my ſentence come foorth from thy preſence, and let thine eies looke vpon the thing that is equall. O hold thou vp my goings in thy waies, that my footſteps ſlip not.

I haue called vpon thee, O God, for thou ſhalt heare me: incline thine eare to me, and hearken vnto my words. Shew thy maruellous louing kindneſſe, thou that art the Sauiour of all them that put their truſt in thee. Keepe me as the apple of an eie: hide me vnder the ſhadowe of thy wings, from the vngodlie that trouble me. Mine enimies compaſſe me round about to take away my ſoule. Up Lord, let not man haue the vpper hand: let the heathen be iudged in thy ſight, that they may knowe themſelues to be but men? Yet of thy mercie, O Lord, forgiue all mine enimies, and turne the harts of ſuch as hate me. Who can tell how oft he offendeth? Oh clenſe thou me from all my ſecret offences. Keepe thy ſeruant alſo from preſumptuous ſinnes; leaſt they get the dominion ouer me: ſo ſhall I be vndefiled and innocent from the great offence. Let my mourning teares, and the ſorowfull ſighing of my hart, come before thy preſence, and be alwaies accepted in thy ſight.
                        O Lord my ſtrength and my redeemer, let it be thy good pleaſure to rid and deliuer me out of all my troubles, I moſt humblie beſeech thee: and ſhew ſome token of thy fauor to me poore wretched ſinner, which am as a baniſhed woman. Looke vpon me, O Lord, I beſeech thee, as thou didſt looke vpon Suſanna, and Sarai the daughter of Raguel. Thoſe holie women truſted in thee, and thou didſt deliuer them; they hoped in thee, and were not forſaken. I knowe Lord, thy ſtrength is not weakened, neither is thy power abated: ſo that if it be thy good pleaſure, O Lord, thou wilt helpe, and make thy power to be knowne. In the meane time, O mercifull and moſt gratious Lord God, giue me grace thankfullie and patientlie to take all, whatſoeuer it ſhall be thy good will and pleaſure to laie vpon me. O Lord grant me thoſe things, which I hartilie haue praied for euer, for Ieſus Chriſts ſake my Lord and my

redeemer. To whom with thee and the holie Ghoſt, be all honour, glorie and praiſe,
                        Amen.
                        
                           When God hath deliuered thee out of thy troubles, ſing thoſe

                        And euer be giuing thanks to God the almightie Lord and King, ſaieng as followeth.
                        A thankeſgiuing after trouble.
                        
                           THe Lord is my ſtrong rocke and my defence, my Sauiour, my God, and my might, in whom I will truſt, the horne alſo of my ſaluation, and my refuge. Yea the Lord is my ſhepheard, therfore can I lacke nothing. He hath comforted my ſoule, and brought it out of trouble, euen for his mercies ſake. Though I walke through the vale of the ſhadowe of death, I will feare none euill: for thou art with me, thy rod and thy ſtaffe comforteth me. For in thee, O Lord, haue I put my truſt, and I feare not what fleſh and bloud can doo vnto me. I haue waited long, and with weeping teares haue I taried the Lords leaſure, and now he hath of his great goodneſſe deliuered me out of all my trouble. Moſt mightie God, of thine accuſtomed mercie, preſerue me from all ſinne and wickedneſſe. O Lord, I feele mine owne infirmitie and weakeneſſe. O moſt mercifull Lord, keepe me in (as it were) with a bit or bridle, that in this my ioifulneſſe I doo not forget my dutie to thee, and my neighbours. For when we haue althings at our owne pleaſure, and nothing to trouble vs, then is our dailie enimie readie to puffe vs vp with pride and vnthankfulneſſe: yea and with forgetfulneſſe of thy lawes. Wherefore moſt mightie Lord, looke downe from thy holie heauens, euen with thy fatherlie eies of pitie, and ſtrengthen my trembling ſoule with thy holie ſpirit. Guide me that I ſwarue not frō thy truth taught in holie Scripture: but that all my thoughts, words

and deeds may redound to the glorie, honour, and woorthie praiſe of thy moſt holie name. This with teares I moſt humblie beſeech thee to grant, euen for Ieſus Chriſts ſake, in whoſe name I come to thee, and in none other, ſaieng: O our Father, &c.
                        
                     
                     
                        Another thankeſgiuing after trouble.
                        
                           O Lord, I moſt humblie render lauds, thanks, and praiſes vnto thee. For thou haſt ſet me vp, and not made my foes to triumph ouer me. O Lord my God, I cried vnto thee, and thou haſt heard me: yea thou broughteſt my ſoule out of trouble, and girded me with ioie and gladnes. Sing praiſes vnto the Lord with me, Oye Saints of his, & let vs all giue thanks vnto him, for a remembrance of his holineſſe. For his wrath indureth but the twinkling of an eie, and in his pleaſure is life euerlaſting. Heauineſſe may endure for a night, but ioie commeth in the morning. Thou didſt turne thy face from me, O Lord; and lo, I was ſore troubled: then cried I vnto thee, O Lord, and praied vnto my God right humblie, ſaieng: Heare, O Lord, and haue mercie on me. Lord be thou my helpe in all my trouble: bow downe thine eare to me, and make haſte to deliuer me: for thou art my ſtrong rocke and deliuerer. Into thy hands, Lord, I commit my ſpirit, for thou haſt redeemed me, O Lord, thou God moſt high.
                        Oh what reward ſhould I giue vnto the Lord for all the maruellous benefits, that he hath done vnto mee: which I can not woorthilie expreſſe? For in my trouble I called vpon the Lord, and he heard me at large; and in my temptation, with his holie ſpirit he mightilie preſerued me. Therefore I knowe that the Lord is on my ſide, and I will not feare what man can doo vnto me. For it is better to truſt in the Lord, than to put anie confidence in Princes; for with the Lord there is

mercie, and with him there is plentious redemption. The earth, O Lord, is full of thy mercie, therefore will I talke of thy praiſe all the daie long, and ſing Pſalmes of thankeſgiuing vnto thee. It is good for me that I haue beene in trouble, elſe ſhould I not haue learned thy ſtatutes. If my delight had not beene in thy lawes, I ſhould ſurelie haue periſhed in my trouble. The lawe of my God is more deerer vnto me than thouſands of ſiluer and gold, yea all the riches in the world is nothing woorth in compariſon of thy word. For it is more comfortable, than the moſt coſtlieſt and pretious reſtoratiue that anie Phyſician can make. For it comforteth, nouriſheth and preſerueth the ſoule, leading it vnto life euerlaſting. Oh Lord God of hoſts, who is like vnto thee? Thy truth moſt mightie God endureth for euermore. I will alwaies giue thanks vnto thee for the great benefits that thou haſt beſtowed on me. The righteous ſhall heare thereof and reioice with me; yea, and the vnrighteous ſhall feare the Lord, and ſaie, Doubtleſſe there is a GOD that defendeth his ſeruants; and he alſo doth puniſh the wrong dooers. Thou art the God that dooeſt woonderous things: O Lord, who may be compared vnto thee? For thou deliuereſt me thy poore oppreſſed ſeruant from the hand of my ſtrong enimie; yea from ſuch a one as was too mightie for me to deale withall. Thou haſt (I ſaie) mightilie defended me, and now, O Lord, be mindfull of me: and command my ſpirit to be receiued in grace, when it is thy good pleaſure,
                        Amen.

                           From vaine deſires and worldlie luſts,

                           Direct my footeſteps by thy word,
                           That I thy will may knowe:
                           And neuer let iniquitie,
                           Thy ſeruant ouerthrowe.

                           OUr Father which art in heauen, halowed be thy name. Thy kingdome come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heauen. Giue vs this daie our dailie bread. And forgiue vs our treſpaſſes, as we forgiue them that treſpaſſe againſt vs. And lead vs not into temptation, but deliuer vs from euill: for thine is the kingdome, the power, and the glorie for euer and euer,
                        Amen.

Borne of the virgin Marie. Suffered vnder Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried. He deſcended into hell. The third daie, he roſe againe from the dead. He aſcended into heauen, and ſitteth on the right hand of God the father almightie. From thence ſhall he come to iudge the quicke and the dead. I beleeue in the holie Ghoſt. The holie Catholike Church. The communion of Saints. The forgiueneſſe of ſinnes. The reſurrection of the bodie. And the life euerlaſting,
                        Amen.

                           The Preface.
                           HEarken O Iſrael. I am the Lord thy God, which haue brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the houſe of bondage.
                        
                        
                           The firſt Table.
                           _1 THou ſhalt haue none other gods before me.
                           2 Thou ſhalt make thee no grauen image, neither anie ſimilitude of things that are in heauen aboue, neither that are in the earth beneath, nor that are in the waters vnder the earth. Thou ſhalt not bow downe to them, nor woorſhip them. For I am the Lord thy God, a gealous God, viſiting the iniquitie of the fathers vpon the children, vpon the third generation, and vpon the fourth of them that hate me: and ſhewing mercie vnto thouſands in them that loue me, and keepe my commandements.
                           
                              
3 Thou ſhalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vaine; for the Lord will not hold him giltleſſe that taketh his name in vaine.
                           4 Remember the Sabboth daie, to keepe it holie. Sixe daies ſhalt thou labour and doo all thy workes: but the ſeauenth daie is the Sabboth of the Lord thy God. In it thou ſhalt not doo anie worke, thou, nor thy ſonne, nor thy daughter, thy man-ſeruant, nor thy maide-ſeruant, nor the ſtranger that is within thy gates. For in ſixe daies the Lord made the heauen and the earth, the ſea, and all that in them is, and reſted the ſeauenth daie: therfore the Lord bleſſed the Sabboth daie, and halowed it.
                        
                        
                           The ſecond Table.
                           _5 HOnour thy father and thy mother, that thy daies may bee prolonged vpon the land which the Lord thy God giueth thee.
                           6 Thou ſhalt not kill.
                           7 Thou ſhalt not commit adulterie.
                           8 Thou ſhalt not ſteale.
                           9 Thou ſhalt not beare falſe witneſſe againſt thy neighbour.
                           10 Thou ſhalt not couet thy neighbours houſe, neither ſhalt thou couet thy neighbours wife, nor his ſeruant, nor his maide, nor his oxe, nor his aſſe, neither anie thing that is thy neighbours.
                        
                        
                           The Summe.
                           
                              THou ſhalt loue the Lord thy God with all thine hart, with all thy ſoule, and with all thy mind: This is the firſt and the greateſt commandement. And the ſecond is like vnto this. Thou ſhalt loue thy neighbour as thy ſelfe.
                           On theſe two commandements hangeth the whole Lawe and the Prophets.

                              O
                            My God and father, I moſt humblie praiſe and thanke thee for this, that of thine infinite goodneſſe and mercie, it hath pleaſed thee to watch for me this night whiles I ſlept, preſeruing me from ſo manie kinds of dangers, wherevnto this miſerable life is ſubiect. O Lord I beſeech thee bring into my memorie thy other great and innumerable benefits alſo, according as I may be able to comprehend them, to the end that I may likewiſe render thanks for the ſame, leaſt I be vngratefull towards thy maieſtie, as thou haſt done me this good, not to forget that thou alone haſt preſerued me from all inconuenience. And herewithall I beſeech thee moſt gratious father, through thy mercie, to continue this thy fatherlie care, which thou haſt for me, vntill ſuch time as I ſhall reſt in that happie ſleepe, whereof they reioice which ſleepe in peace, through our Lord Ieſus Chriſt thy ſonne, who in the vnitie of the holie Ghoſt, liueth and reigneth God with thee eternallie: So be it.

                              O
                            Our God, Father & Sauiour, ſeeing it hath pleaſed thee to giue vs grace to paſſe this night, to come vnto this daie preſent, vouchſafe now alſo to beſtowe this goodneſſe vpon vs, that we may emploie our ſelues altogether to thy ſeruice, in ſuch wiſe, that we neither thinke, ſaie, or doo anie thing, but onlie to pleaſe thee, and to obey thy good will: to the end that by this means, all our works may be to the praiſe of thy name, and to the edifieng of our neighbours. And as it hath pleaſed thee to cauſe thy Sunne to ſhine vpon the earth, to lighten vs corporallie; vouchſafe alſo by the cleereneſſe of thy ſpirit, to illuminate our vnderſtandings, and our hearts, to direct vs vnto the ſtreight waie of righteouſneſſe. Euen ſo, to what thing ſoeuer we may applie our ſelues, let our chiefe end & purpoſe be alwaies to walke in thy feare, to ſerue and honour thee: looking for all our wealth and proſperitie, from out of thy holie bleſſing, to the end we enterpriſe nothing which ſhall not be agreeable vnto thee. Moreouer, let vs ſo trauell for our bodie, and for the life preſent, that we alwaie haue a further regard; namelie, to the life of heauen, which thou haſt promiſed vnto thy children. Neuertheleſſe, let it pleaſe thee to be our protector, both touching the bodie, and touching the ſoule, ſtrengthening vs againſt all temptations of the diuell, and deliuering vs from all the dangers that may come vnto vs. And becauſe there is nothing well begun, which doth not continue, vouchſafe to receiue vs into thy holie gouernance, not onlie for this preſent daie; but for our whole life, continuing and increaſing dailie thy grace in vs, till thou haſt brought vs vnto the full coniunction of thy ſonne Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, who is the true Sun-light of our

ſoules, ſhining daie and night without end perpetuallie. And to the intent that we may obteine theſe graces of thee, O vouchſafe to forget all our faults paſt, pardoning vs them through thine infinite mercie, as thou haſt promiſed vnto all them that ſeeke thee with a good heart. Heare vs O father of mercie, for thy ſonne our Lord Ieſus Chriſt his ſake: So be it.

And let ſuch fauour of thine ſerue vs for a teſtimonie of thy bountifulneſſe and aſſiſtance: and that we by the ſame may knowe the fatherlie care, which thou haſt for vs. Moreouer, let it pleaſe thee, O Lord, to aſſiſt vs by thy holie ſpirit, to the end that we may be faithfullie exerciſed

in our eſtate and vocation, without anie guile or deceit: but that we rather regard to followe thine ordinance, than to ſatiſfie our owne deſire of gaine. And if it pleaſe thee to proſper our labor, giue vs alſo a willing mind to ſuccour thoſe that are in neceſſitie, according to the abilitie which thou haſt granted vs: ſo yet that we mind not to lift vp our ſelues aboue thoſe, which haue not receiued of thee ſuch liberalitie. And when thou wilt handle vs with greater pouertie and neceſſitie than our fleſh ſhall deſire: let it pleaſe thee, O Lord, to ſhew vs this grace, euen to knowe that thou through thy bountifulnes wilt continuallie nouriſh vs, leaſt we be tempted with miſtruſt: but that we patientlie abide, vntill thou repleniſh vs, not onelie with thy corporall gifts; but alſo with thy ſpirituall graces; that we may ſtill haue more ample matter and occaſion to thanke thee, & ſincerelie to ſtaie our ſelues vpon thine onlie goodneſſe. Heare vs, O Father of all mercie, through thy ſonne Ieſus Chriſt our Lord: So be it.

                           O Lord, which art the fountaine of all wiſdome and knowledge, ſeeing it hath pleaſed thee to giue mee the meanes to be inſtructed in the age of mine infancie, to make mee knowe how to gouerne the whole courſe of my life holilie and honeſtlie: vouchſafe alſo to illuminate mine vnderſtanding, (which of it ſelfe is

blind) that it may comprehend the learning which ſhall be taught me. O vouchſafe to confirme my memorie for to keepe it well. O let it be thy pleaſure to diſpoſe my hart to receiue it willinglie, and with ſuch a deſire as is conuenient, that through mine ingratitude the occaſion that thou offereſt me be not loſt. For to doo this, vouchſafe to powre vpon me thy holie ſpirit, the ſpirit (I ſaie) of all vnderſtanding, veritie, iudgment, prudence and learning, which may make me able to profit well, to the end that the trauell, which ſhall be taken to teach me be not loſt. And to what ſtudie ſoeuer I applie my ſelfe, make me to reduce it vnto the true end; namelie, to knowe thee in our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, to haue full affiance of ſaluation and life in thy grace, and to ſerue thee vprightlie & purelie, according to thy good pleaſure: ſo as all that I ſhall learne, may be as an inſtrument to aid me vnto the ſame.
                        And ſeeing thou promiſeſt to giue wiſdome vnto babes, and to the humble, and to confound the proud in the vanitie of their owne minds: likewiſe to ſhew thy ſelfe vnto thoſe that are of a right hart; and contrarilie to blind the wicked & peruerſe: vouchſafe to bring me vnto true humilitie, whereby I may yeeld my ſelfe apt to learne; and obedient, firſt vnto thee, ſecondlie to my ſuperiours, whom thou haſt ordeined to rule and to teach me. Furthermore, vouchſafe to diſpoſe my hart to ſeeke thee without feinedneſſe, renouncing all carnall and euil affections, and that in ſuch ſort I may prepare my ſelfe now to ſerue thee once, in that eſtate & vocation, to the which it ſhall pleaſe thee to ordeine me when I ſhall come to age. Heare me, O Father of mercie, through our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: So be it.

We beſeech thee not to ſuffer our affections to be here rooted in theſe corruptible things, but that we alwaies haue an higher reſpect, waiting for our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, vntill he appeere in our redemption: So be it.

                        O Lord God, Father eternall, we beſeech thee, that it will pleaſe thee to caſt the eie of thy fatherlie mercie vpon vs thy poore ſeruants, not laieng to our charge ſo manie faults and offences, whereby we are worthie to be brought vnto thy iudgement, and whereby wee ceaſe not to prouoke thy wrath againſt vs. And foraſmuch as we are too vnwoorthie to appeare before thy holie Maieſtie; vouchſafe to receiue vs in the name of thy welbeloued ſonne our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, accepting the merits of his death and paſſion for a recompenſe of all our faults: regarding rather the obedience which he hath rendred vnto thee, and not the manifold faults that we dailie commit againſt thy Maieſtie. O Lord God, ſeeing it hath pleaſed thee to create the night for mans reſt, ſo as thou haſt ordeined him the daie to trauell; grant vs grace ſo to take our bodilie reſt this night, that our ſoules may alwaie watch vnto thee, that our harts be lift vp in thy loue; and that we ſo renounce all earthlie cares, that we ſuccour our ſelues according as our infirmitie requireth. Let vs neuer forget thee, but let the remembrance of thy goodneſſe and grace continue alwaie printed in our memorie; and by this meanes our conſciences alſo ſhall haue their ſpirituall reſt, as our bodies take theirs.

preſerue vs vnderfiled, both in our bodies, and in our ſpirits, and to keepe vs againſt all dangers, that our verie ſleepe may be to the glorie of thy name. And ſeeing the daie is not ſo paſſed, but that we haue offended thee manie waies (according as we are poore ſinners) ſo that all is now hid through the darkneſſe that thou ſendeſt vpon earth; vouchſafe alſo to burie all our faults through thy mercie, leaſt we thereby bee taken from thy preſence. Let it pleaſe thee alſo, O Lord God, to illuminate vs by thy holie ſpirit, in the true vnderſtanding of thy holie will: and bring to paſſe alſo, that we may yeeld vnto thee the loue and feare that true and faithfull ſeruants doo owe vnto their maſters, and children vnto their parents, ſeeing it hath pleaſed thee to ſhew vs ſuch grace, as to receiue vs into the number of thy ſeruants and children,

                           How manie Sacraments are in the Chriſtian Church?
                        
                        
                           C
                           Two.
                        
                        
                           M
                           Which be they?
                        
                        
                           C
                           Baptiſme, and the Lords Supper.
                        
                        
                           M
                           What is the ſignification of Baptiſme?
                        
                        
                           C
                           It hath two parts. For our Sauiour doth therein repreſent vnto vs the remiſſion of our ſinnes, & then our regeneration or ſpirituall renouation.
                        
                        
                           M
                           And the Supper, what ſignifieth it vnto vs?
                        
                        
                           C
                           It ſignifieth vnto vs, that by the communion of the bodie and bloud of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, our ſoules are nouriſhed in hope of the life euerlaſting.
                        
                        
                           M
                           What is it that the bread and wine (which are giuen vs in the Supper) doo repreſent vnto vs?
                        
                        
                           C
                           They repreſent vnto vs, that the bodie and bloud of Ieſus Chriſt haue ſuch vertue towards our ſoules, as the bread and wine haue towards our bodies.
                        
                        
                           M
                           Underſtand you, that the bodie of Ieſus Chriſt may be incloſed in the bread, and his bloud in the wine?
                        
                        
                           C
                           No.
                        
                        
                           M
                           Where then muſt we ſeeke Ieſus Chriſt to enioie him?
                        
                        
                           C
                           In heauen, in the glorie of his father.
                        
                        
                           M
                           What is the meanes to come vnto heauen, there as Ieſus Chriſt is?
                        
                        
                           C
                           It is faith.
                        
                        
                           M
                           It behooueth vs then to haue true faith, before we can well vſe this holie Sacrament.
                        
                        
                           C
                           It is ſo.
                        
                        
                           M
                           And how may we haue this faith?
                        
                        
                           C
                           We haue it by the holie ſpirit that dwelleth in

our harts, and aſſureth vs of Gods promiſes, which are made vnto vs in the Goſpell.
                           Unto God the Father, of whom, and by whom, and in whome are all things. And vnto Ieſus Chriſt our Lord and Redeemer of the world. And vnto the holie Ghoſt be honour and glorie for euer, So be it.
                           
                        
                        
                           The true ſumme of all Chriſtian Religion.
                           
                              Mother.
                              
                                 MY child, art thou a Chriſtian?
                           
                           
                              Child.
                              Yea, by the grace of God, whereas of nature I was a child of wrath as well as others.
                           
                           
                              M
                              Art thou certaine that thou art a Chriſtian?
                           
                           
                              C
                              Yea, through faith, and the holie ſpirit, who giueth witneſſe vnto my ſpirit, that I am the child and heire of God.
                           
                           
                              M
                              What is it to ſaie a Chriſtian?
                           
                           
                              C
                              It is the ſame which by faith in Ieſus Chriſt, hath receiued the holie ſpirit, as a child of God, dooing his dutie in time and place.
                           
                           
                              M
                              What is the dutie of a Chriſtian?
                           
                           
                              C
                              It is for to knowe God, for to ſerue him in ſpirit and truth, according to the doctrine of Ieſus Chriſt.
                           
                           
                              M
                              In how manie points conſiſteth the true Chriſtian adoration, and the true ſeruice of God?
                           
                           
                              C
                              It is faith, which is the onelie foundation of Chriſtians.
                           
                           
                              M
                              The faith, commeth it of vs?
                           
                           
                              C
                              No, for it is the gift of God.
                           
                           
                              M
                              Where lieth this faith?
                           
                           
                              C
                              In the hart, for with the hart we beleeue to righteouſneſſe, & with the mouth we confeſſe to ſaluation.
                           
                           
                              M
                              Be we then bound to render a reaſon of our faith and hope?
                           
                           
                              C
                              Yea, to all men that demand it of vs, ſo that it be done with wiſedome, gentlenes, reuerence, and gratious

words.
                           
                           
                              M
                              And he that confeſſeth not Ieſus Chriſt in time and place, doth he not renounce him?
                           
                           
                              C
                              Yea: for he that is not with him, is againſt him: & he that gathereth not with him, ſcattereth abroade.
                           
                           
                              M
                              Giue me then a reaſon of thy faith, and firſt what confeſſion makeſt thou of the Chriſtian faith?
                           
                           
                              C
                              The ſame that the Church holdeth, being founded vpon the doctrine of the Prophets and Apoſtles, which is brieflie comprehended in our Creede.
                           
                           
                              M
                              Canſt thou make confeſſion in the common language?
                           
                           
                              C
                              Yea, I thanke God.
                           
                           
                              M
                              Saie it with an high voice, and pronounce it well.
                           
                           
                              C
                              I beleeue in God the Father almightie, &c.
                           
                           
                              M
                              Beleeueſt thou that thou art ſaued by this faith of the Church?
                           
                           
                              C
                              Yea well, if I haue it in my ſelfe, as the firſt word ſheweth (I beleeue in God.) For the iuſt ſhall liue by his owne faith.
                           
                           
                              M
                              What is it to beleeue in God?
                           
                           
                              C
                              It is a full aſſurance and hope to truſt and commit all to him, according to his promiſes in Ieſus Chriſt.
                           
                           
                              M
                              Can we haue this faith in perfection, whiles we be in this world?
                           
                           
                              C
                              No. For we haue neede with the Apoſtles to require augmentation of faith. The Lord increaſe it in vs, and make vs perſeuere in it vnto the end.
                           
                        
                        
                           Of Inuocation.
                           
                              Mother.
                              
                                 WHat is the ſecond part of Chriſtian adoration, and ſeruice of God?
                           
                           
                              Child.
                              It is inuocation, whereby we haue all

our refuge vnto our father, through faith in the name of Ieſus Chriſt.
                           
                           
                              M
                              Why putteſt thou inuocation after faith?
                           
                           
                              C
                              Becauſe it is one of the greateſt and principall fruite of the ſame. For whoſoeuer calleth vpon the name of the Lord in faith, ſhall be ſaued.

                              Haue we commandement to call vpon God onlie, and not vpon others?
                           
                           
                              C
                              Yea, euen as we are commanded, neither to beleeue nor worſhip anie other, but him alone.
                           
                           
                              M
                              Should we not praie to the father in the name of other, but of Ieſus Chriſt?
                           
                           
                              C
                              No. For the father hath giuen vs none other aduocate but him, who onlie is verie God and verie man: and we haue no promiſe to be heard in the name of anie other, but in his name onlie.
                           
                           
                              M
                              Yea, but we knowe not what we ought to praie as apperteineth.
                           
                           
                              C
                              Ieſus Chriſt teacheth vs by his holie ſpirit, according to the forme that he hath giuen vs.
                           
                           
                              M
                              Rehearſe it in the common language, to the end that we all may vnderſtand it, and be edified.
                           
                           
                              C
                              Our father which art in heauen, &c.
                           
                           
                              M
                              Wherefore will he that we call him father?
                           
                           
                              C
                              To declare the loue that he beareth towards vs in Ieſus Chriſt, to the end that in full aſſurance and boldneſſe we may come to him onlie, and not to be afraid of him, no more than a child is of his father.
                           
                           
                              M
                              What doth this word (our) ſhew?
                           
                           
                              C
                              The vnitie and charitable brotherhood which ought to be heere well practiſed among vs, according as the communion of Saints requireth.
                           
                           
                              M
                              Seeing that God is euerie where, and filleth heauen and earth, ought not we to ſeeke and worſhip him in all his creatures?
                           
                           
                              C
                              No. For he is a ſpirit, and incomprehenſible:

wherfore he willeth that in Ieſus Chriſt we ſeeke and worſhip him in ſpirit and truth, lifting vp our hearts aboue all corruptible things.
                           
                           
                              M
                              What conteine the ſixe petitions comprehended in this praier?
                           
                           
                              C
                              The three firſt, all yt which makes for the aduancement of the honor and glorie of God, which we ought to deſire with our whole hart, and before all things.
                           
                           
                              M
                              And the three laſt, what doo they conteine?
                           
                           
                              C
                              Our entertainement and ſaluation, which is alſo the glorie of God.
                           
                           
                              M
                              Why addeth he to the end: For thine is the kingdome, the power, and the glorie, for euer?
                           
                           
                              C
                              To ſhew that the dignitie & efficacie of our praiers conſiſteth not in vs, but altogether in that good father by Ieſus Chriſt, working in vs by the holie ſpirit.
                           
                           
                              M
                              Then is it to ſaie, that we all will liue and die in his obedience, ſubiection and glorie?
                           
                           
                              C
                              Yea, acknowledging him to be the author of all goodneſſe; and vnto whome onelie apperteineth the true maieſtie roiall, with all power and glorie for euer.
                           
                           
                              M
                              What is the concluſion of this praier?
                           
                           
                              C
                              It is, that all our deſires, requeſts, and actions of grace be addreſſed vnto God alone, through Ieſus Chriſt, confirming vs throughlie in ſubſtance vnto that which it conteineth, as vnto the perfect rule of all true godlineſſe.
                           
                           
                              M
                              Why is this word added to the end Amen, or So be it?
                           
                           
                              C
                              To aſſure vs that our praier made thus in truth, and according to his will, is trulie heard.
                           
                        
                        
                           Of Obedience.
                           
                              Mother.
                              WHat is the third point of Chriſtian adoration, and ſeruice of God?
                           
                           
                              C
                              It is to obeie the lawe of God, in true charitie,

out of a pure hart, and out of a pure conſcience, and of faith vnfained.
                           
                           
                              M
                              What is this charitie here required?
                           
                           
                              C
                              It is to loue God with all our hart, ſoule, vnderſtanding and power: and our neighbour as our ſelfe.
                           
                           
                              M
                              This true obedience and charitie, proceedeth it not of faith?
                           
                           
                              C
                              Yea, & all the good works here commanded, which God hath prepared that wee ſhould walke in them.
                           
                           
                              M
                              Faith then, it is not an opinion vaine and fleſhlie, to entiſe vs to ſinne more boldlie, and to liue in all carnall libertie.
                           
                           
                              C
                              No. For if we by faith be trulie graffed in Ieſus Chriſt, and call vpon God to ſaluation, we will no more bring foorth the works of the fleſh, but the fruits of the ſpirit.
                           
                           
                              M
                              Which are the works of the fleſh?
                           
                           
                              C
                              Adulterie, fornication, filthineſſe, outragiouſnes, idolatrie, enimitie, ſtrife, emulation, anger, altercation, ſedition, ſects, enuie, murther, dronkenneſſe, gluttonie, and things like vnto the ſame.
                           
                           
                              M
                              And which are the fruits of the ſpirit?
                           
                           
                              C
                              Loue, ioie, peace, patience, benignitie, goodneſſe, faith, caurteſie, temperance.
                           
                           
                              M
                              Seeing we are all carnall, euill, and ſeruants of ſinne, haue we power of our ſelues to doo good, and to keepe vs from euill?
                           
                           
                              C
                              No, not ſo much as to thinke anie good thing. For it is God that worketh in vs both the will and the deed, according to his good will.
                           
                           
                              M
                              We muſt not then doo euerie one of vs, what ſeemeth vnto him good and right; what good nature, inclination, or free will ſoeuer he alledge.
                           
                           
                              C
                              No. For of vs can come nothing but perdition; but ail our goodnes, aid & ſaluation comneth of God onlie.
                           
                           
                              M
                              Our reaſon, wiſdome, and intent, can the ſame be

the rule to knowe and diſcerne of our works, whether they be good or euill?
                           
                           
                              C
                              No. For we haue all but one Lawe-giuer, who hath giuen vs the true and perfect rule out of the ten commandements of the lawe.
                           
                           
                              M
                              What conteine the foure commandements of the firſt table?
                           
                           
                              C
                              How God declareth himſelfe to be our God, and therefore by good right he requireth of vs faith, homage, adoration, obedience and dutie.
                           
                           
                              M
                              And the ſix commandements in the ſecond table, what doo they conteine?
                           
                           
                              C
                              Our office and dutie towards our neighbour; which is to doo vnto him, as we would be done vnto our ſelues: and not to doo vnto him that, which wee would not to be done vnto our ſelues.
                           
                           
                              M
                              Go to, recite now this holie lawe.
                           
                           
                              C
                              Harken, O Iſrael; I am the Lord thy God, which haue brought thee out of the land of Aegypt, &c. as Exodus. 20.
                           
                           
                              M
                              And how is it, that Ieſus Chriſt accompliſhed in vs this lawe ſo perfectlie?
                           
                           
                              C
                              In giuing vs his holie ſpirit, who ingendreth in vs a continuall deſire and mind, to doo all that the lawe commandeth vs, as neere as we can.
                           
                           
                              M
                              And this obedience ſo vnperfect, doth it pleaſe God?
                           
                           
                              C
                              Yea, by this, that our imperfection is not imputed vnto vs, bicauſe of Ieſus Chriſt, whoſe iuſtice and perfect obedience is ours through faith.
                           
                           
                              M
                              Alas, who ſhall giue vs the hart and the power to doo the will of God, which he here hath declared vnto vs by his holie ordinances?
                           
                           
                              C
                              It ſhall be euen he himſelfe by his ſpirit, in the name of Ieſus Chriſt his ſonne, whom he hath giuen vnto the death, to deliuer vs from the condemnation

of the lawe, and from the bondage of ſinne, that is to ſaie from eternall death.
                           
                        
                        
                           Of Confeſsion.
                           
                              Mother.
                              
                                 WHat is the fourth point of Chriſtian adoration and ſeruice of God?
                           
                           
                              C
                              It is the ſolemne confeſſion or acknowledging that we make in the Church, through the vſe of the Sacraments.
                           
                           
                              M
                              What confeſſion?
                           
                           
                              C
                              Of all good things, both generall and particular, which we receiue in the Church, through the communion that we haue with Ieſus, and togither among our ſelues one with another.
                           
                           
                              M
                              Doo we not dailie make ſuch a confeſſion vnto God, in hearing his word, and calling vpon him, ſeeking to obeie him, according to the benefits which hee hath giuen vnto vs?
                           
                        
                        
                           Sacraments.
                           
                              Child.
                              YEa certainlie. But we make it alſo through the exerciſe of the Sacraments in greater force and edifieng.
                           
                           
                              M
                              Shew the reaſon.
                           
                           
                              C
                              Bicauſe they are annexed to the preaching and promiſes of the Goſpell, to mooue our ſoules and bodies to praiſe God with greater confirmation of our faith and loue.
                           
                           
                              M
                              Underſtandeſt thou not, that there is one like ſaluation by preaching, and by the Sacraments offered vnto all, as well to the faithfull, as to the vnfaithfull?
                           
                           
                              C
                              Yea: but the vnfaithfull, in reſpecting this ſaluation, receiue nothing but the word & outward ſignes to their condemnation.
                           
                           
                              M
                              Neuertheleſſe, the Sacraments doo not ſignifie and repreſent leſſe to one than to the other.
                           
                           
                              
                              C
                              It is certaine. For God is alwaie true, and vſeth not to teach lies.
                           
                           
                              M
                              The Lord then hath ioined the Sacraments with the preaching and promiſes of the Goſpell, as the ſeales are ioined with the letters and inſtruments which they confirme.
                           
                           
                              C
                              Yea, to print & ſeale them the more in our ſoules & bodies, & to mooue all our ſenſes vnto this confeſſion.
                           
                           
                              M
                              The Sacraments then are vnto vs great ſuccor and comfort.
                           
                           
                              C
                              Yea, in our infirmities, diſquietneſſe, and temptations, which come dailie vnto vs, as well from the diuell and the world, as from our owne fleſh.
                           
                           
                              M
                              Which are the Sacraments that the Lord Ieſus hath inſtituted in his Church?
                           
                           
                              C
                              Baptiſme and the Supper, putting end vnto Circumciſion, and to the Paſchall Lambe.
                           
                           
                              M
                              How is it that he himſelfe hath authoriſed and ſanctified them?
                           
                           
                              C
                              In that he would receiue Baptiſme in his owne bodie, and to be the firſt adminiſtrator of the Supper.
                           
                           
                              M
                              Where is it yt the Lord commandeth Baptiſme?
                           
                           
                              C
                              In S. Matthew the laſt Chapter: And Ieſus came and ſpake vnto them, ſaieng: All power is giuen vnto me in heauen and in earth. Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptiſing them in the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the holie Ghoſt, teaching them to keepe all thoſe things that I haue commanded you.
                           
                           
                              M
                              Is Baptiſme a waſhing of bodilie filthineſſe?
                           
                           
                              C
                              No. For ſo little water can doo nothing to vs.
                           
                           
                              M
                              From what filthineſſe then are we there waſhed?
                           
                           
                              C
                              From ſpirituall filthineſſe, which are our ſinnes.
                           
                           
                              M
                              We come then into the world all filthie and corrupt.
                           
                           
                              C
                              If we were not conceiued in ſinne, and borne in

iniquitie, we ſhould not haue to doo with baptiſme.
                           
                           
                              M
                              In whoſe name be we baptiſed?
                           
                           
                              C
                              In the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the holie Ghoſt, who is our onlie and verie true God in three perſons.
                           
                           
                              M
                              And with what water are we waſhed and regenerated?
                           
                           
                              C
                              With the water of life, which is the holie ſpirit, in the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt.
                           
                           
                              M
                              Baptiſme then repreſenteth vnto vs, & aſſureth vs of the full remiſſion of our ſinnes, and exchanging of our wicked nature.
                           
                           
                              C
                              Yea, and by the ſame both we and our children are receiued into the Church, as partakers of the couenant of the Lord, as well as Abraham and his ſeed by circumciſion.
                           
                           
                              M
                              Seeing that by baptiſme we are borne, clothed, waſhed, and regenerated in the houſe of God, which is the Church: with what meat, and with what drinke are we nouriſhed and fed?
                           
                           
                              C
                              Euen with himſelfe, who hath begotten vs. For as he is our waſhing and clothing: ſo is he vnto vs meate and drinke.
                           
                           
                              M
                              Is this bicauſe he is the word of God, which is the true food of our ſoules?
                           
                           
                              C
                              Yea, and we muſt go further: ſeeing that his word became fleſh, whereof it commeth that we are nouriſhed with his fleſh, & with his bloud into life eternall.
                           
                           
                              M
                              And how is it that his bodie was made meate or heauenlie bread, and his bloud drinke vnto vs?
                           
                           
                              C
                              By his death and paſſion, as he declareth in his holie Supper.
                           
                           
                              M
                              Where ſhall we find the inſtitution of the holie Supper?
                           
                           
                              C
                              In three Euangeliſts, and verie largelie declared in the firſt to the Corinthians the xi. Chapter.
                           
                           
                              
                              M
                              Reade the place.
                           
                           
                              C
                              I receiued of the Lord, that which I haue giuen vnto you; namelie, that the Lord Ieſus, in the ſame night that he was be traied, tooke bread; and when he had giuen thanks, hee brake it, and ſaid: Take, eate, this is my bodie, which is broken for you: doo this in remembrance of me. Likewiſe, after ſupper he tooke the cup, ſaieng: This cup is the new teſtament in my bloud: doo this as often as you ſhall drinke it in the remembrance of me. For as often as you ſhall eat of this bread, and drink of this cup, ye ſhall declare the Lords death vntill he come. Wherefore, whoſoeuer ſhall eate of this bread, or drinke of this cup vnwoorthilie, ſhall be guiltie of the bodie and bloud of the Lord. But let a man examine himſelfe, and ſo let him eat of this bread, and drinke of this cup. For whoſoeuer eateth and drinketh vnwoorthilie, eateth and drinketh his owne damnation, making no difference of the Lords bodie, (or not diſcerning the bodie of the Lord.)
                           
                           
                              M
                              Did not the Lord then miniſter vnto all equallie, one bread and one wine in his Supper?
                           
                           
                              C
                              Yea, as indifferentlie as he died for all, and commanded to take, eate, and drinke.
                           
                           
                              M
                              What ſignifieth then the bread of the Supper?
                           
                           
                              C
                              The pretious bodie of Ieſus, which he gaue vnto the death of the Croſſe for vs.
                           
                           
                              M
                              And what ſignifieth the wine?
                           
                           
                              C
                              His pretious bloud, which he ſhed vpon the Croſſe for vs.
                           
                           
                              M
                              This bread and wine being called the bodie and bloud of the Lord, doo they change their ſubſtance and nature?
                           
                           
                              C
                              No: but as we corporallie eate the bread, & drinke the wine; ſo ſpirituallie we eate the bodie, and drinke the bloud of the Lord.
                           
                           
                              M
                              And how may we aſcend vp to heauen (where he

                              By loue, and liuelie faith; ſeeing that alreadie we haue there our conuerſation, and that the words of the Lord are ſpirit and life.

                              And he being in heauen, how is it that he communicateth vnto vs his bodie and his bloud; we being heere belowe vpon the earth?
                           
                           
                              C
                              By the vertue of his holie ſpirit, by whome he ioineth vs vnto himſelfe, and maketh vs partakers of himſelfe in true holineſſe of ſoule and bodie.
                           
                           
                              M
                              The Infidels, may they eate the bodie, and drinke the bloud of the Lord?
                           
                           
                              C
                              Naie: for through their infidelitie, they receiue it to their condemnation, as did Iudas.
                           
                           
                              M
                              How muſt we prepare our ſelues, before we come to this holie Table?
                           
                           
                              C
                              Euerie one muſt proue himſelfe, whether he come with true faith and repentance, and with Chriſtian charitie, as he witneſſeth.
                           
                           
                              M
                              The true preparation then, and worthineſſe conſiſteth not in this, that our faith & charitie be ſo great as it ought to be.
                           
                           
                              C
                              No: for though we ought continuallie to tend therevnto, yet ſhall we neuer be able to come at it.
                           
                           
                              M
                              How is it then, that our faith, ſo little and vnperfect, ſaueth vs, and maketh vs worthie to receiue that which is offered vnto vs by the Goſpell, and the Sacraments?
                           
                           
                              C
                              In that, that it ſoundeth vs, and maketh vs wholie to reſt in the righteouſneſſe, dignitie, and perfection of Ieſus, vnto whome onlie the father hath regard.
                           
                           
                              M
                              Muſt all they be receiued, that preſent themſelues to the Supper?
                           
                           
                              C
                              Yea, all thoſe whom we knowe to be diſciples, and members of Ieſus, willing to liue and die in this faith and doctrine thereof.
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                        A collection of the principall points, which they ought to knowe, that will communicate at the holie Supper of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt.
                        
                           THere is one onlie God, on whome all things depend.
                        1 The firſt point to honor God well, conſiſteth in this, that we haue all our confidence in him, and that we perceiue the meanes to knowe him; namelie, in Ieſus Chriſt. Heerevnto ſerueth the confeſſion of faith before recited. The ſaid confeſſion conteineth foure parts.
                        The firſt is of God the father, who is the beginning and principall cauſe of all things.
                        The ſecond of his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, who is the eternall wiſdome of God. And in this part is comprehended the whole hiſtorie of our redemption, to know, that by Ieſus Chriſt alone we obteine ſaluation, and the meanes whereby he hath purchaſed it for vs:
                        The third of the holie ſpirit, who is the vertue and power of God, which he powreth vpon his creatures, and neuertheleſſe is reſident ſtill in himſelfe.
                        The fourth of the Church, and of the graces of God towards the ſame.
                        2 The ſecond point to honour God aright, conſiſteth in this, that we obey his will. The rule to obey him, is giuen vs in the ten commandements of the lawe.
                        The foure firſt commandements conteine the dutie that we owe vnto God.
                        The ſixe following conteine the dutie that we owe vnto our neighbours.
                        3 The third point to honor God aright, conſiſteth in this, that in all our neceſſities we call vpon him alone.
                        The inſtruction to call rightlie vpon God, is giuen vs in the praier of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.
                        The three firſt petitions of the ſame praier, concerne the glorie of God.
                        
                           
The other three concerne our owne welfare & profit.
                        4 The fourth point to honour God aright, lieth in this, that we looke for all good things at his hand, as it is he onlie from whom all good things proceede.
                        The promiſes of this free goodneſſe that God vſeth towards his owne, are conteined in the Goſpell.
                        The ſame promiſes are comprehended by faith.
                        Faith is an aſſured knowledge of the good will of God towards vs, grounded vpon the free promiſes, which is giuen vnto vs in Ieſus Chriſt, and confirmed in our hearts by his holie ſpirit.
                        Becauſe of the weakeneſſe of our faith, our Lord hath giuen vs the Sacraments.
                        A Sacrament is an outward teſtimonie, which by a viſible ſigne repreſenteth vnto vs the promiſes of God, ſpirituallie accompliſhed in vs.
                        Baptiſme is vnto vs as an entrance into the Church of God, and repreſenteth vnto vs the remiſſion of our ſinnes, and our renouation of life.
                        The water, as the propertie thereof is to waſh, doth ſignifie the waſhing of our ſoules, which is done for vs through the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt, in the forgiuenes of our ſins.
                        The water alſo is put vpon the head, in ſigne of death: neuertheleſſe, in that it is done but for a little time, it is a figure of our reſurrection.
                        The Supper was inſtituted of our Lord, to aſſure vs, that by the communion of his bodie, & of his bloud, our ſoules are nouriſhed in hope of life euerlaſting.
                        The bread and the wine ſignifie vnto vs the bodie & bloud of Ieſus Chriſt, which haue the ſame propertie towards our ſoules, that the bread and wine haue towards our bodies; namelie, to nouriſh & ſtrengthen.
                        The right vſe of cōmunicating at ye ſupper, is chieflie, a man to proue himſelfe, whether he haue true faith with repentance & charitie towards his neighbours.

                           D. M.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                        A godlie exhortation to mortification of our ſinfull affections, and to holinèſſe of life: written by a vertuous Gentlewoman.
                        
                           IF yee liue after the fleſh, you ſhall die: but if ye through the ſpirit doo mortifie the deeds of the bodie, ye ſhall liue. For as many as are led by the ſpirit of God they are the ſonnes of God. Rom. 8.
                        This alſo, we knowe the ſeaſon that we ſhould now awake out of ſleepe. For now is our ſaluation neere: the night is paſſed, the daie is come nie: let vs put on the armor of light, let vs walke honeſtlie, as it were in the day light, not in eating and drinking, neither in chambering and wantonneſſe, neither in ſtrife and enuieng: but put yee on the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and make no prouiſion for the fleſh, to fulfill the luſts of it. Rom. 13.
                        The reward of ſinne is death: but eternall life is the gift of God through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord. Rom. 6.
                        Deerlie beloued, abſtaine from fleſhlie luſts, which fight againſt the ſoule: and ſee that ye haue honeſt conuerſation among the Gentils, that wheras they backbite you as euill dooers, they may ſee your good works, and glorifie God in the daie of viſitation. 1. Peter. 2.
                        I ſaie walke in the ſpirit, and fulfill not the luſts of the fleſh. For the fleſh luſteth contrarie to the ſpirit, and the ſpirit contrarie to the fleſh. Theſe are contrarie one to the other, ſo that ye can not doo whatſoeuer ye would: but and if ye be led of the ſpirit, then are ye not vnder the lawe. The deeds of the fleſh are manifeſt, which are theſe: adulterie, fornication, vncleanneſſe, wantonnes, worſhipping of images, witchcraft, hatred, variance, zeale, wrath, ſtrife, ſeditions, ſects, enuieng, murther, dronkenneſſe, gluttonie, & ſuch like. Of the which I tell yee before, as I haue told you in

times paſt, that they which commit ſuch things, ſhall not be inheritours of the kingdome of God. They trulie that are Chriſts, haue crucified the fleſh with the affections and luſts thereof. Galat. 5.
                        Let no filthie communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to edifie withall: as oft as neede is, that it may miniſter grace vnto the hearers, and grieue not the holie ſpirit of God. Phil. 4.
                        Followe not thy luſts, but turne thee frō thine owne will. For if thou giueſt thy ſoule hir deſires, it ſhall make thine enimies to laugh thee to ſcorne. Sirac. 18.
                        An adulterous woman ſhall be troden vnder foot as mire of euerie one that goeth by the waie. Sirac. 9.
                        Ye adulterers, and women that breake matrimonie, knowe ye not how that the friendſhip of the world is enimitie to God-ward. Whoſoeuer will be a friend of the world, is made enimie of God. Submit your ſelues to God, and reſiſt the diuell, and he will flie from you: drawe nie to God, and he will drawe nie to you. Clenſe your hands ye ſinners, and purge your harts ye wauering minded: ſuffer afflictions, ſorrowe ye, and weepe, let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your ioie to heauineſſe. Caſt downe your ſelues before the Lord, and he ſhall lift you vp. Iames. 4.
                        For the children of adulterers, they ſhall come to an end, and the ſeed of an vnrighteous bed ſhall be rooted out. And though they liue long, yet ſhall they be nothing regarded, and their laſt age ſhall be without honour. If they die haſtilie they haue no hope, neither ſhall they be ſpoken to in the daie of knowledge. For horrible is the death & end of the vnrighteous. Wiſd. 3.
                        The children of the vngodlie are abhominable children, and ſo are all they that accompanie with the vngodlie. The inheritance of vngodlie children ſhall come to naught, and their poſteritie ſhall haue a perpetuall ſhame and confuſion. Wo be vnto you ye vngodlie,

which haue forſaken the lawe of the higheſt. If ye doo liue, ye ſhall be curſed: if ye die, the curſe ſhall be your portion. Labour to get thee a good name, for it ſhall continue ſurer by thee, than a thouſand great treaſures of gold. Sirac. 41.
                        The Lord alloweth the righteous, but the vngodlie and him that delighteth in wickedneſſe, doth his ſoule abhor. Upon the vngodlie he ſhall raine ſnares, fire and brimſtone, ſtorme and tempeſt, this ſhall be their portion to drinke. For the righteous Lord loueth righteouſneſſe. Pſal. 11.
                        As for ſinners, they ſhall be confounded out of the earth, and the vngodlie ſhall come to an end. Pſal. 103.
                     
                     
                        Another godlie exhortation to moue vs to praier, and to cauſe vs to be in a continuall readineſſe to waite on our Maiſter Chriſt, when he ſhall come againe to iudge both the quicke and dead: written by the ſame godlie Gentlewoman.
                        
                           REioice in the Lord alwaies, and againe I ſaie reioice: let your ſoftneſſe be knowne to all men. The Lord is euen nie at hand, be carefull for nothing: but in all praier and ſupplication, let your petitions bee manifeſt vnto God with giuing of thanks. Be feruent in ſpirit: applie your ſelues to the time: reioice in hope: be patient in tribulation: continue in praier. Rom. 22.
                        Take heed therefore how ye walke: circumſpectlie, not as vnwiſe, but as wiſe men redeeming the time, bicauſe the daies are euil. Wherfore be ye not vnwiſe, but vnderſtand what the will of the Lord is. And be not dronken with wine, wherin is exceſſe: but be filled with the ſpirit, ſpeaking vnto your ſelues in Pſalmes and Hymnes, and in ſpirituall ſongs, ſinging and making melodie to the Lord in your harts: giuing thanks alwaies for all things vnto God the Father, in the

name of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, ſubmitting your ſelues one to another in the feare of God. Epeſ. 5.
                        Praie alwaies with all maner of praiers and ſupplications in the ſpirit, and watch therevnto with all inſtance and ſupplication. Epheſ. 6.
                        Uerelie verelie I ſaie vnto you ſaith Chriſt, Whatſoeuer yee aſke the father in my name, he will giue it you. Aſke, and yee ſhall receiue, that your ioie may be full. And when thou praieſt, thou ſhalt not be as the hypocrites are, for they loue to praie ſtanding in the Synagogues, and in the corners of the ſtreetes, becauſe they would be ſeene of men: verelie I ſaie vnto you, they haue their reward. But when thou praieſt, enter into thy Chamber, and when thou haſt ſhut the dore, praie thou to thy father which is in ſecret, and thy father which ſeeth in ſecret, ſhall reward thee openlie. And when thou praieſt, babble not much as the heathen do, for they thinke, that they ſhall be heard for their much babbling ſake. Be yee not like them therefore, for your father knoweth whereof yee haue neede, before yee aſke of him. After this maner therfore praie yee. Our father which art in heauen, halowed be thy name, &c. Matth. 6.
                        Watch and praie, for you knowe neither the daie, nor yet the houre when the ſonne of man commeth in his glorie, & all the holie Angels with him. Then ſhall he ſit vpon the ſeate of his glorie, and before him ſhall be gathered all nations; and he ſhall ſeparate them one from another, as a ſhepheard diuideth the ſheepe from the goates: and then he ſhall ſet the ſheepe on his right hand, and the goates on the left. Then ſhall the King ſaie to them on his right hand, Come yee bleſſed children of my father, inherit the kingdome prepared for you from the beginning of the world, for I was an hungred, and yee gaue me meate. Then ſhall the King ſaie vnto them that ſhall be on the left hand, Depart

from me ye curſſed, into euerlaſting fire, which is prepared for the diuell and his Angels. For I was an hungred, and yee gaue me no meate, I was thirſtie, and ye gaue me no drinke. Then ſhall they anſwer him ſaieng: Lord; when ſawe we thee an hunged, or a thirſt, or naked, or ſicke, or in priſon, and did not miniſter vnto thee. Then ſhall he anſwere them ſaieng: Uerelie, I ſaie vnto you, in aſmuch as you did it not to one of the leaſt of theſe, ye did it not vnto me. And theſe ſhall go awaie into euerlaſting paine, but the righteous to life eternall. Matth. 25.
                        As Ieſus ſate in mount Oliuet, his diſciples came vnto him ſecretlie, ſaieng: Tell vs when theſe things ſhall be, and what ſigne ſhall be of thy comming, and of the end of the world. And Ieſus anſwered, and ſaid vnto them: Take heed that no man deceiue you, for manie ſhall come in my name, ſaieng, I am Chriſt, and ſhall deceiue manie. Yee ſhall heare of warres, and of the fame of warres, but ſee that you be not troubled, for all theſe things muſt come to paſſe, but the end is not yet. Matth. 24.
                        And there ſhall be ſignes in the Sunne, and in the Moone, and in the Stars, and in the Earth: the Sea, and the waters ſhall roare, and mens harts ſhall faile them for feare, and for looking for thoſe things which ſhall come on the earth. Behold the figge tree, and all other trees, when they ſhoote foorth their buds; ye ſee and knowe of your owne ſelues that Summer is then nigh at hand. So likewiſe yee, when ye ſee theſe things come to paſſe, vnderſtand that the kingdome of God is then nigh at hand. Luke. 21.
                        But of that daie and houre no man knoweth, no not the Angels of heauen, but my father onlie. As the time of Noah was, ſo ſhall likewiſe the comming of the ſonne of man be. For as in the daies before the floud, they did eate and drinke, marie and were maried, euen

vnto the daie that Noah entered into the ſhip, and knew of nothing till the floud came; and tooke them all awaie, ſo ſhall alſo the comming of the ſonne of man be. Matth. 23.
                        Take heede to your ſelues, leaſt your hearts be ouercome with ſurfeting and dronkenneſſe, and cares of this world, and that daie come on you vnwares. For as a ſnare ſhall it come vpon all them that ſit on the face of the earth. Watch therefore continuallie, and praie, that ye may obtaine grace, and flie all this that ſhall come, and that ye ſtand before the ſonne of God. Luke. 21.
                        Take heed, watch and praie, for ye knowe not when the time is. As a man which is gone into a ſtrange Countrie, and hath left his houſe, and giuen authoritie to his ſeruants, and to euerie man his worke, and commanded the porter to watch. Watch therefore, for yee knowe not when the maiſter of the houſe will come, whether at euen, or at midnight, whether at the cocke-crowing, or in the dawning, leaſt if he come ſuddenlie, he ſhould find you ſleeping, and that I ſaie vnto you, I ſaie vnto all men, Watch and praie. Matth. 13.
                        Be ſober and watch, for your aduerſarie the diuell, as a roring Lion, walketh about ſeeking whome hee may deuoure, whome reſiſt yee ſtedfaſtlie in faith.
                        Finallie, let vs in all our praiers remember to praie for the Queenes moſt excellent Maieſtie, that it will pleaſe the almightie God to proſper hir in all hir affaires, and ſend hir a long and triumphant reigne ouer vs, that ſhe may ouercome all hir enimies, and that after this painefull life ended, ſhe may reigne with Chriſt in his heauenlie kingdome, there to receiue a glorious crowne that neuer ſhall periſh: So be it.

                        The 18. Pſalme of DAVID, which he made for the firſt beginning of his gratulation and thankeſgiuing vnto God, in the entring into his kingdome, for the maruelous mercies, victories and graces of God towards him: paraphraſticallie explaned and opened by that godlie learned man THEODORE BEZA.
                        
                           I Doo loue thee, O LORD, my ſtrength: I doo loue thee, euen from the bottome of my hart.
                        The Lord is my rocke, and my fortreſſe, my deliuerer, my God, my mount, my refuge, my ſheeld, the horne wherwith I driue awaie the enimie, and my high tower of defence.
                        I haue praiſed the Lord, and called vpon him: and he hath deliuered me from all mine enimies.
                        
                           
The bands of death had compaſſed me round about & bound me: moſt wicked men, like moſt raging flouds, made me afraid, enuironing me round about.
                        I did lie as it were wrapped in my winding ſheete, euen ſnarled with the ſnares of death.
                        I called vpon the Lord in theſe extremities, I called vpon my God, I ſaie, and he heard my voice out of his high palace: and receiued into his eares the crie that I made vnto him in the priſon.
                        Then began the earth to quake and tremble, the verie foundations of the mountaines to ſhake and ſhudder.
                        And he breathed out ſmoke from his noſtrels, ſpitting foorth fire out of his mouth: yea caſting foorth euen coales of fire.
                        He bowed the heauens and came downe, the darkeneſſe being ſpred all abrode vnder his feete.
                        He did ride vpon the wings of the Angels, and was caried with the wings of the wind.
                        Blacke darkneſſe enuironed his tabernacle round about, and he was caried with moſt darke and thicke clouds.
                        Untill his gliſtering brightneſſe did breake thoſe clouds, and the flames of fire did flaſh on euerie ſide.
                        At the length, he thundered from heauen, and filled all places with his mightie ſounding voice, and with haile-ſtones and lightenings.
                        He ſhot foorth his fierie darts, and increaſing his lightenings, he terrified mine enimies, and deſtroied them.
                        Then the deepe bottoms of the waters appeared, and the foundations of the world were diſcouered at thy rebuke, O Lord, and at the bluſtering wind of thy wrath.
                        So then hath he (ſtretching his right hand from the heauen) taken me, and drawne me out of the bottome

of the deepe waters.
                        From the mightie enimie, I ſaie, and from the other enimies, by whoſe power I was oppreſſed.
                        For they verelie had almoſt caſt me downe, and deſtroied me at the ſudden: but he was my ſtaffe that ſtaied mee.
                        And he hath drawne me out of theſe ſtreights, and placed me in an open and large place: bicauſe it ſo pleaſed him (without my deſeruing) to fauour me.
                        For he had regard indeed of me, that ſo was oppreſſed of theſe men without cauſe, & granted theſe things to me being guiltleſſe.
                        For I haue followed the waie that the Lord hath appointed me, howſoeuer theſe men vexed me: neither could I be drawne by anie of their iniuries, that I ſhould fall from my God as the wicked vſe.
                        For I had all his lawes before mine eies, neither did I put his ſtatutes foorth of my ſight.
                        But I behaued my ſelfe without hypocriſie with him, neither did I followe mine affections, which elſe would eaſilie haue caried me foorth of the waie.
                        Therefore had the Lord regard of me that was oppreſſed of them without anie cauſe: and fauoured mee the innocent partie.
                        For thou, O Lord, wilt ſhew thy ſelfe good and vpright to them that deale vprightlie.
                        And as thou ſheweſt thy ſelfe ſincere, with them that deale ſincerelie: ſo the craftie men ſhall perceiue thee to be more cunning.
                        For although manie times thy ſeruants be ſore vexed: yet dooeſt thou preſerue them, and dooeſt caſt downe thoſe that behaue themſelues ſo proudlie.
                        Hence haue I my light, whereby thou cauſeſt me to ſhine: and driueſt awaie my darkneſſe.
                        Thou haſt made me to ouercome theſe dangers eaſilie, and to leape ouer the wals and lets that were in

my waie.
                        For the waie whereby God leadeth vs is plaine, the word of God is moſt pure: the Lord doth defend all that truſt in him as with a ſhield.
                        For who is God, but the Lord? And who is mightie, but our God onelie?
                        He hath girded me with power, and hath made my waie ſafe.
                        He hath made me as ſwift as the Hinds, and hath placed me in moſt high and ſafe places.
                        He hath taught mine hands to fight, and he hath giuen me ſo great ſtrength, that I am able to breake a bowe of braſſe with theſe mine armes.
                        Thou haſt preſerued me with the protection of thy ſhield, & thou haſt ſtaied me with thy right hand, when I was readie to fall, through thy great mercie.
                        Thou haſt cauſed me to go ſafelie without danger, and thou haſt ſtaied my ſliding ſteps.
                        Therefore haue I purſued mine enimies, and taken them, and I haue not turned back, till I haue deſtroied them.
                        I haue ſo beaten them downe, and troden them vnder foote, that they were not able to raiſe themſelues againe.
                        For thou verelie haſt giuen me ſuch ſtrength, that they which haue riſen againſt me, haue fallen hedlong at my feete.
                        Thou haſt giuen me power to ſtrike off their heads, and that I might deſtroie them that purſued me.
                        Yet Lord, I grant they cried vnto thee: but thou haſt not deliuered them, neither wouldeſt heare their crie.
                        Therefore did I beate them ſmall, like the duſt that the wind ſcattereth abroad: and I did beate them like the mire, which is tempered vnder the foote of them that walke the ſtreets.
                        Yea, alſo thou haſt deliuered me from domeſticall and

inward troubles, and thou haſt giuen me dominion ouer the nations that I neuer knewe before.
                        Unknowne people (I ſaie) obey my commandements, and ſtrangers be compelled for feare to ſubmit themſelues vnto me.
                        The hearts of the ſtrangers haue failed, ſo that they fall downe for feare in their ſtrongeſt forts.
                        Let the Lord liue, and let him that is my defence be knowledged and worſhipped of all, as he worthilie deſerueth. Let God my deliuerer bee praiſed euerie-where.
                        Euen God (I ſaie) who is mine aduenger, who hath ſubdued ſo manie people vnder me.
                        Thou haſt ſaued me from mine enimies, thou haſt deliuered me from them that roſe vp againſt me, eſpeciallie from that cruell curſſing man.
                        Therefore will I praiſe thee, euen amongſt the prophane nations, and I will ſing vnto thy Maieſtie.
                        For verelie thou haſt maruellouſlie preſerued thy Queene, & not onlie ELIZABETH hir ſelfe, whom thou haſt annointed Queene, but alſo thou haſt ſhewed ſingular fauour to hir poſteritie that ſhall remaine for euer,
                        Amen.
                        * Glorie therefore be vnto thee ô FATHER, the Sonne, and the holie Ghoſt, as it was from all beginnings, is at this preſent, and euer shall be through all ages and worlds, world without end:
                        Amen, AMEN.
                     
                     
                        
                        The 118. Pſalme made by DAVID, when he obteined his kingdome after the death of Saule.
                        
                           OH acknowledge, & declare yee openlie that the Lord is good, for his bountious goodneſſe is for euer.
                        Let Iſrael now confeſſe this thing, for his bountious goodnes and mercie endureth for euer.
                        Let the ſtocke of Aaron now confeſſe, that his louing kindneſſe is perpetuall.
                        Let all the ſincere woorſhippers of the Lord now confeſſe this, that his louing kindneſſe is perpetuall.
                        I doubtleſſe, being a notable example of his vnſpeakable bountie, haue not ceaſed (as yee knowe) to call vpon him in my greateſt extremities: and he (as you your ſelues ſee) hauing heard me, hath exalted me into this moſt large roome.
                        Wherefore I, hauing experience that the Lord worketh for me, and that he is ſo neere at hand vnto me, God forbid that I ſhould feare the power or the threats of anie man.
                        For the Lord himſelfe is the chiefe leader of thoſe that helpe me, ſo that I can not doubt at all, but that I ſhall ſee with mine eies thoſe enimies which remaine iuſtlie puniſhed of him.
                        Oh how far better is it to truſt in the Lord, than in men!
                        
                           
How far better is it to truſt in the Lord, than in anie men, how excellent ſoeuer they be!
                        Behold, manie nations compas me about, but I calling vpon ye Lord, ſhal moſt vndoubtedlie deſtroy them.
                        They compaſſe me in I ſaie, they beſet me round about, but calling vpon the Lord, I ſhall moſt vndoubtedlie deſtroie them.
                        Mine enimies in great multitudes compaſſe me like ſwarmes of Bees, but I ſhall forthwith ſtiffle them, as though they were caſt into the fire, and calling vpon the Lord, I ſhall moſt vndoubtedlie deſtroie them.
                        For in deede before, the moſt cruell enimie did ſo ſore thruſt at me, that I ſeemed euen now readie to fall: but as I was falling, the Lord ſupported me.
                        Therefore I accompt him mine onlie ſtrength, I acknowledge him to be my Sauiour, and praiſe him in my ſong.
                        Heereof come thoſe voices of thoſe that ſing, and reioice together with me, out of their tabernacles, now doubtleſſe the Lord hath aduanced the power of his moſt ſtrong right hand.
                        The Lord hath now exalted that his right hand, now the Lord hath ſhewed foorth the power of his moſt ſtrong right hand.
                        Behold me then that am yet aliue, and about to ſet foorth the works of God.
                        For though he hath ſtriken me verie ſore, yet hath he ſpared me life.
                        I praie thee therefore, let that gate now at the length be open vnto me, which onlie the louers of righteouſneſſe muſt go vnto, that I being entred thither, may praiſe the Lord.
                        For it is conſecrate vnto the Lord, therefore is it open to the iuſt alone.
                        Heere will I praiſe thee, O Lord, becauſe thou giuing eare haſt deliuered me.
                        
                           
For the ſtone which the verie chiefe builders haue ſo ſtubbornelie as yet reiected, as nothing fit, is not onlie now counted in the building: but euen as a principall it vpholdeth the whole weight of the verie building.
                        Uerelie, it is a worke of God indeede, which maketh all the beholders thereof to be amazed.
                        Go to then, ſeeing the Lord hath commanded this moſt ioifull daie to ſhine vnto vs, let vs paſſe it wholie in mirth becomming Saincts, and ſaie:
                        I beſeech thee O Lord, preſerue the Queene that is giuen vs from heauen. I praie thee, I ſaie, I praie thee O Lord giue the Queene ELIZABETH all proſperitie.
                        Let hir haue proſperitie and bliſſe, that commeth to gouerne vs in the name and commandement of God. We wiſh proſperitie to you alſo; that are the neerer inhabitants of the houſe of the Lord.
                        Iehoua is the onlie God, who ſhineth vnto vs, binde the Lambe with cords, that is brought to the hornes of the altar.
                        Thou art my God, I will praiſe thee, thou art my God, I will ſing thy praiſes moſt lowd.
                        Confeſſe that the Lord is exceeding good, for his bountious goodneſſe is euerlaſting.
                        * Glorie be therefore vnto thee ô bleſſed Trinitie, the Father, Sonne, and holie Ghoſt, as alwaies it hath bin, continuallie is, and euer shall be, worlds without ending: So be it.

                        O Almightie GOD, moſt gratious Lord, and heauenlie Father, behold, I thine handmaid proſtrate here before the throne of thy diuine Maieſtie, meeklie confeſſe thee to bee my mercifull God, my higheſt King, and euerlaſting Sauiour; and humblie I acknowledge thee the Souereigne Lord aboue all lords; the higheſt King of all kings, and the onelie omnipotent Creator, wiſe preſeruer, and woonderfull ruler of all thy creatures in heauen and earth, high and lowe, viſible and inuiſible: and my ſelfe alſo to be the worke of thine hands; the ſheepe of thy paſture; a ſubiect and ſeruant to thy moſt high and ſacred Maieſtie, and a child depending alone and wholie vpon thy diuine and fatherlie prouidence for all things. And bicauſe I knowe vnthankfulneſſe doth greatlie diſpleaſe thee, (For it is the root of all ſpirituall euill, and the onelie thing that dammeth vp the fountaine of thy godlie mercie for euer,). I will giue thanks vnto thee, O Lord, leaſt I be vnthankfull to thee, my God, my deliuerer and Sauiour. And I yeeld thee now moſt humble and hartie thanks, for that it hath pleaſed thee, of thy ſingular mercie, to giue mee this eſpeciall honour: firſt, to ſuffer for thy glorious truth much extreme miſerie, feare, care, impriſōment, perill of bodie, trouble of mind, hazard of life, and danger of death, by ſickneſſe, fire, conſpiracie, and ſword:

and afterward bleſſedlie protecting and preſeruing me from ſo manifold dangers, and miraculouſlie deliuering me out of the hands of all mine enimies; to call me to this excellent ſtate & roiall dignitie of a Prince: and as this daie to cloath me with the garments of honour; to ſet the Crowne of gladneſſe, and diademe of dignitie vpon mine head; to put the ſcepter of righteouſneſſe, the globe of glorie, and the ſword of thy power into mine hands, and to annoint and conſecrate me thine handmaid QVEENE of this Realme, that I might bee the principall member and chiefe inſtrument in the ſame to aduance thy glorie, and further thy Goſpell, for the which I ſuffered. Yea, to be thy peoples Ioſeph, their Moſes, their Ioſua, their Dauid, their Ioſias, their Samuel, and their Salomon: finallie, to be their Deborah, their Iael, their Heſter, their Iudith, and their Elizabeth; that is, their reſt, ſtaie, and ſtaffe of Maieſtie, their ſhepheard and ring-leader in the waie of vertue, holineſſe, zeale, and ſincere religion. Which maruellous worke of thine, oh gratious GOD, for thy name ſake, giue me grace, not onlie this daie; but all the daies and time of my life to remember and ſolemnize with woorthie thanks-giuing: that with the Queene of Saba I may continuallie bleſſe thee, and ſaie; Bleſſed be thou O Lord my GOD, which thus haſt loued me, and thy people, to ſet me in thy throne as QVEENE, and to eſtabliſh them for euer, by making me their Gouernour ouer them in thy ſteed, to execute thy iudgement and iuſtice.
                     Neither can I now forget, but thankfullie alſo call to my remembrance all thy other great mercies, O mercifull God, ſhewed towards me ſince my comming vnto the Crowne: namelie, how often in thy mightie and maruellous mercie thou haſt deliuered vnto mee & my Counſell, the wicked attempts, malignant deuiſes, and miſcheeuous practiſes wrought and conceiued

of all my common, craftie, and cruell enimies, Sathan, and his miniſters; who to exalt themſelues, and to rob mee both of thy people, kingdome, peace, and religion, euen of verie malice and deadlie hatred, haue by all diuelliſh meanes raged, blaſphemed, and conſpired againſt thee, O GOD, and thy truth, like hypocrites: againſt mee and my Crowne, like traitours; and againſt their Common-wealth and countrie, like ſpoilers: and that for no offence of mine to themward, LORD, thou knoweſt; but onelie of cruell ſpite they beare mee, bicauſe in truth I profeſſe thy Chriſtian religion, and ſeeke by eſtabliſhing the ſame through good and godlie lawes, to ſerue thee zealouſlie, ſincerelie, and purelie; according to the rule and veritie of thine eternall word. Which thy great benefits, when I well conſider, togither with mine vnwoorthineſſe thereof, I am euen forced with my father DAVID, to giue humble thanks, and to bleſſe thee before all the congregation, and ſaie: Bleſſed be thou, O LORD GOD of Iſrael, our Father for euer and euer. Thine, O LORD, is greatneſſe, and power, and glorie, and victorie, and praiſe. For all that is in heauen and in earth is thine. Thine is the kingdome, O LORD, and thou excelleſt, (as head ouer all.) Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reigneſt ouer all; and in thine hand is power and ſtrength: in thine hand, I ſaie, O mightie GOD, it is to make great, and to giue ſtrength vnto all: now therefore I thanke thee, and praiſe thy glorious name for euer. But who am I, O Lord GOD, and what is my people, that thou haſt brought mee to this honour, and thus redeemed and deliuered both mee and thy people out of thrall vnto thy ſelfe, and art beecome our GOD? Dooth this apperteine to man, O LORD? Or commeth not this rather of thy free mercie, more than of anie our woorthineſſe? And

what can ELIZABETH ſaie more vnto thee? For thou Lord God knoweſt thy ſeruant, & euen for thy words ſake, & according to thine owne hart, haſt thou made my fountaine become a floud, and my light to ſhine as the ſunne: and done all theſe great things, to make them knowne vnto thy ſeruant.
                     Now therefore, for this thy gratious fauour after ſo long reſtraint; ſo great dangers ouerpaſſed; ſuch bluſterous ſtorms ouerblowne; ſo many iniuries digeſted, & wrongs ſuſteined, by thy mightie protection, O mercifull God, to my no ſmall comfort, & thy peoples commoditie, in exalting, erecting, and bringing me out of thrall to libertie; out of darkneſſe into light; out of danger to peace and quietneſſe; from dread to dignitie; from miſerie to maieſtie; from mourning to ruling: breeflie, of a priſoner to make me a Prince, and to place me in the roiall throne, there to ſit as Queene now full 24. yeeres, in the admirable reſt, bleſſed quietneſſe, and long peace, which I now enioie. For this thy diuine wiſdome, O heauenlie father, in vnfolding, reuealing, & fruſtrating the proud platformes, & peeuiſh practiſes of Achitophels, & all mine enimes. For this thy meere mercie, O deere Chriſt, in ſpacing me and my people ſo long frō the bloudie hands of ſpoilers, oppreſſors, traitors & vſurpers. For this thy heauenlie prouidence, O holie Ghoſt, in preuenting their diueliſh purpoſes, and ſo gratiouſly protecting, preſeruing and defending me, as wel before I was Queene, as ſince, from ſo extreme miſeries, and manifold dangers, as alſo frō the hands and violences of al mine enimies, viſible & inuiſible, domeſticall & foraine. Finallie, for theſe & for all other thy great graces, ſingular bleſſings, and meſtimable benefits, & principall vertues, ſpirituall & corporall, O glorious Trinitie, which through the mercie & merits of my ſweet Sauior Ieſus Chriſt, thou hertofore frō my birth haſt, preſentlie dooeſt, or hereafter vnto my death

ſhalt bountifullie beſtowe vpon me and my people: I moſt hartilie laud, entirelie magnifie, and inceſſantlie extoll thy moſt high, holie and renowmed name, and ſacred Princelie Maieſtie.
                     And as I meeklie euen of dutie from the bottome of my hart, render vnto thee my GOD and my King, all condigne honour, woorthie praiſe, and poſſible thanks, togither with the vnfeined reſignation of all empire, kingdome, power, rule, dominion, maieſtie and glorie, both in heauen and in earth, as to thee onlie, and moſt iuſtlie belongeth: ſo now I moſt humblie and hartilie beſeech thy diuine Maieſtie, O excellent Father, and moſt mercifull GOD, to haue mercie vpon me thine humble handmaid and ſinfull ſeruant. And be not prouoked, good Lord, with my ſinnes, nor with the ſinnes of my parents & people, to giue vs ouer to the luſt of our enimies. Make vs not a reproch vnto the fooliſh, nor let our aduerſaries in our ouerthrowe triumph againſt vs, ſaieng, Where is now their God? But of thy rich mercie and woonted compaſſion in Chriſt Ieſu, forgiue me my ſinnes both old and new, both ſecret and open, both paſt, preſent, and to come: yea from both mine owne and others faults, O God, I beſeech thee deliuer me, and caſt all mine offences into the bottomleſſe depth, out of thy remembrance and ſight for euer: making the croſſe and paſſion, the death and reſurrection of thy moſt deere and onlie ſonne my ſweete Sauiour, and onlie Redeemer Ieſus Chriſt the righteous and immaculate Lambe, moſt effectuall in mee to all vertue, godlineſſe of life, and pietie, as beſt becommeth thy daughter, thy virgin, thine annointed, and elect veſſell of honour. That to all other thy good graces, & bountifull benefits alredie ſhewed towards me: the which of thine accuſtomed goodneſſe I beſeech thee to confirme, finiſh, and worke out in mee, as thou haſt gratiouſlie begun, and continue towards mee to

the end according to thy good pleaſure, with ſuch further increaſe thereof from time to time, as beſt ſhall ſerue to the ſetting foorth of thy glorie, the benefit of thy Church to all poſteritie, & mine eternall peace in Chriſt Ieſus the Prince of peace. Grant, I ſaie, O Lord, this alſo may be added: namelie, that as it hath pleaſed thee in thy ſecret wiſdome to quicken me, that was Tanquam ouis, euen as a ſeelie ſheepe or lambe led to be ſlaine, to raiſe me vp out of the duſt and mire of perſecution, to lift me vp out of the pit and dungeon, and to ſet me the chiefe of the Princes of this land, and to make mee meete to inherīt the ſeate of glorie, yea to build me the chiefe and head piller of this thy Church of England, France and Ireland, wherevpon the whole bodie of thy Saints therein doo ſtaie themſelues in thy bleſſed peace and vnitie. As I ſaie, it is thy good will, not my deſerts, to exalt the horne of thine annointed: to appoint me a fraile woman thy Lieutenant here on earth: and to giue power vnto thy QVEENE to iudge the ends of thy dominions, and execute thine office here amongſt thy people for a ſpace in the regall ſeate of iuſtice and mercie: ſo vouchſafe thou, O gratious God, and louing Father, in like mercie to powre downe continuallie vpon me all thoſe thy ſpeciall good gifts, princelie vertues, and heauenlie graces, fit for this my ſo high calling, that being plentiouſlie indued therewith, the bright ſhining beames thereof, as from a glittering Star in the firmament, or the glorious Sunne in his orient ariſing, to the ſetting foorth of thy moſt glorious, inuiſible, and eternall Maieſtie, in this my fraile, earthlie and viſible maieſtie, may cleerelie ſhine and appeare in me, to the benefit of thy Church farre and neere. And that I remembring whoſe miniſter I am, may firſt aboue all things, in a perfect zeale of thy houſe, and loue of thy people, euer ſeeke thy honour and glorie, and ſtudie continuallie

to preſerue thy people committed to my charge, in wealth, peace and godlineſſe. Deere Father, ſo bleſſe mee, ſo loue mee, ſo in the ſpirit of counſell, prudence, knowledge and fortitude, ſanctifie, ſtrengthen, and direct me, that in a perfect faith, feare and loue, as in thy ſight, I may walke vprightlie, without offence giuing, in the obedience of thy holie word, and fulfilling of thy bleſſed commandements all the daies of my life: and may be a true follower of that King, which is the Souereigne ouer the holie hill of Zion, whoſe ſeate and kingdome endureth for euer. Giue mee grace both thankfullie to acknowledge thy manifold great benefits beſtowed vpon mee, and alſo faithfullie and diligentlie to diſcharge my dutie towards thee, and thy people, in executing thy iudgements indifferentlie without parcialitie, to the aduancement of thy kingdome, the eſtabliſhment of my throne, and the vniuerſall comfort and commoditie of all thy people.
                     Make me, good Lord, of an entire affection, and perfect hart towards thee: and of an humble and gentle ſpirit towards all vnder my gouernement, after the example of Chriſt our eternall King, who to fulfill thy will, O GOD, did vouchſafe to take fleſh of the virgin Marie, and became man for man, that man might become a God vnto men: and who alſo did verie much abaſe and humble himſelfe as a ſeruant, euen vnto the death of the Croſſe, to redeeme both Prince and people out of thrall and bondage of ſinne, Sathan, death and hell. Let my naturall affection and diſpoſition, I ſaie, O Lord, continue to my foes terrible; to my ſubiects amiable; to mine offenders mercifull; to the vertuous bountifull; to all men indifferent; and parciall to none: that being guided by thee to gouerne thy people iuſtlie, in all godlie peace and quietneſſe, I may be able with a good conſcience to witneſſe of mine integritie before thee and all the world, as thy faithfull ſeruants

Moſes, Samuel, and Nehemias ſomtimes did of theirs, and boldlie and trulie with them ſaie: Behold, here I am; beare record of me before the Lord, & before his annointed. Whoſe oxe, or whoſe aſſe haue I forceablie taken awaie? Or whom haue I done anie wrong to? Or whom haue I iniured or hurt? Or of whoſe hand haue I receiued anie bribes, to blind mine eies therewith, and I will reſtore it you: that my people ſeeing, and well perceiuing my motherlie affection, faithfull gouernement, carefull diligence, and diligent watchfulneſſe ouer them, by all meanes to doo them all the good I poſſiblie may or can in thee, may woorthilie witneſſe, rightlie anſwere, and iuſtlie confeſſe and ſaie of me, to thy glorie, and my perpetuall praiſe, as the Iſraelites heretofore ſaid of Samuel: That I haue not grieued them, nor troubled my land by oppreſſion or iniurie: that I haue not hurt them, nor taken ought of anie mans hand, nor by anie meanes, either by my ſelfe or others, willinglie abuſed my power, or dealt vniuſtlie with my people.
                     Oh kindle more and more in my hart, I beſeech thee, moſt holie Father, a pure zele aboue all things to promote thy glorie, and a vigilant care, not onelie to ſerue thee my ſelfe ſincerelie; but alſo to haue thee diligentlie ſerued of my familie & people. And to this end vouchſafe I praie thee, both to adorne me with all thy heauenlie gifts: and alſo to bleſſe my whole familie, court and houſhold with thy graces and vertues; that all theſe, both high and lowe, one and other, which are placed therein vnder me, may for their vertuous life, true faith, and right religion towards thee their God: and for their loiall harts, and conſcionable obedience towards me their Prince and Miſtres: and for their entire affection and charitie one towards another as brethren: and laſtlie, for their hartie loue and naturall good-will they beare to their Commonwelth

and countrie, be an example and patterne of true godlineſſe and puritie, both in religion and life, for all the whole Realme and countrie, yea the whole world beſides to followe, as their head, fountaine and light.
                     Moreouer, O bleſſed God, as hitherto by thy mightie protection thou haſt preſerued me, and in thy great mercie, maugre the heads of all mine enimies, miraculouſlie haſt deliuered me, and eſtabliſhed me in this my kingdome, thus long in admirable peace and bleſſed quietneſſe, all glorie and praiſe be rendered vnto thy glorious name therfore: ſo I beſeech thy gratious goodneſſe, O Lord, in like mercie to bleſſe, preſerue, maintaine, keepe and defend me, and my Realme ſtill, from all both forreine and domeſticall conſpiracies, treaſons, deceits, and violences of enimies, and from all other dangers and perils imminent and to come, both bodilie and ghoſtlie, publike and priuate: that I may ſtill gouerne bleſſedlie ouer a bleſſed people, and my Realme and people, by thy defence and protection, continue in the truth of thy Goſpell, and happie enioieng of perfect peace and quietneſſe both outward and inward.
                     Thou, O Lord of hoſts, haſt ordeined me the Gouernour ouer thy people, and made my people to be thy people: and thou Lord art become our God, yea and our great and mightie God, beſides whom wee haue none other God. I knowe alſo, my God, that thou trieſt the hart, and haſt pleaſure in righteouſneſſe: behold therefore, I offer, vow, and dedicate my ſelfe willinglie and entirelie in the vprightneſſe of my hart, to ſerue and worſhip thee onelie for euer with ioie, and therfore am I thine handmaid bold to praie this praier vnto thee, beſeeching thee for euer to keepe me, and to helpe me in this my good purpoſe of holie ſeruing and worſhipping of thee. For that which I haue hitherto done, is nothing at all to ſpeake of. O direct thou continuallie

the thoughts of my mind, and prepare my hart euermore vnto thee. Giue vnto me thine handmaid a perfect hart to keepe thy commandements, thy teſtimonies, and thy ſtatutes, and cauſe me to vſe my power lawfullie, to the reforming both of thy houſe, and eſtates, according to the preſcript rule of thy written word & reuealed will, that ſo it may pleaſe thee O Lord God to confirme, for euer thy mercifull promiſes made vnto me in my father DAVID, and to bleſſe the throne or houſe of thy ſeruant, with thy bleſſing, that it may continue and be eſtabliſhed before thee for euer.
                     And that this may the better come to paſſe, to the glorie of thy name, the benefit of thy Church, and wealth of my Realme, as I hartilie wiſh and deſire: remoue far from thy Church, far from me O excellent father, all thoſe which fall from thee by infidelitie, and are through obſtinate wilfulneſſe traiterous rebels to thy ſacred Lawe, and ſincere Religion, which I profeſſe. Let backbiters together with ſuch as are proud, and thoſe that dare ſhameleſlie preſume anie thing, be vtterlie rooted out: but contrariwiſe, let there be ſpace in eſpeciallie for ſuch as be verie zealous of the truth, that they onlie may be conuerſant with me before thee, and cauſe me to feede them with a ſingular faith and innocencie, and miniſter all things diligentlie vnto them.
                     Finallie, let not the enimies of thy Goſpell I beſeech thee O gratious and mightie God, thus deſpiſe thy grace offered them vnto repentance: but thoſe that are to be conuerted, conuert and turne them O God ſpeedilie, if it be thy will. Make thou Saule at the length to become a Paule: and let not the perſecutor perſiſt in his errours, but let them rather accompt thy long ſuffering, and my peaceable and vnbloudie gouernement, an occaſion of ſaluation to their ſoules, and of vnfeigned loue to thy Church. Otherwiſe, if

they will needes remaine ſtill diſobedient to thy truth, diſloiall vnto me, dangerous to the ſtate, and enimies to their Countrie and Common-wealth, then O God of my ſaluation, ariſe, and helpe to wound the head of thine enimies, and the hearie ſcalpe of ſuch as go on ſtill in their wickedneſſe. Let thy right hand find out them that euerie daie prouoke thee, and reuenge thy ſelfe on thoſe blaſphemous hypocrites, that thus proudlie contemne thee to thy face. And as thou haſt diſcouered them, and their peeuiſh practiſes, againſt thee and thine annointed, ſo diſcouer them ſtill. As thou haſt preuented their diueliſh purpoſes, and execrable intents, ſo preuent them ſtill. Yea let their firie eies waxe wearie with looking, their bloudie harts and hands faint with waiting for their golden daie, and that which commeth not yet; neither let come O Lord I beſeech thee, but in thy good time, and according to thy will, a bleſſed and healthfull reigne vnto my ſelfe, much ioie and comfort to my ſubiects, and long peace to Zion for euermore.
                     Laſtlie, O moſt mightie God, looke what remaineth yet of the happie building, enlarging and finiſhing of thy Church, and to the eſtabliſhing and planting of thy Religion perfectlie therein, according to the preſcript rule of thy bleſſed word, and full diſcharge of my dutie, when I ſhall be called to render an accompt before the iudgement ſeate of Chriſt: becauſe that without thee I can do nothing, neither is it poſſible to pleaſe thee, do thou O father of light, from whome all good gifts doo come and proceede, vouchſafe to powre downe plentifullie of thy principall ſpirit vpon me, and ſo rauiſh my hart with the flame of the loue of thee and thy people, & with an earneſt zeale of thy houſe, that with Ioſeph I may carefullie and faithfullie prouide for thy people: with Moſes painefullie leade them out of the deſerts of errour and oppreſſion: and with Ioſhua,

bring thy people into the land of promiſe: with Debora fight thy battels: with Iahel knocke Siſera of Roome in the temples of his vſurped headſhip: with Iudith cut off the head of proud Holophernes: with Hezekias and Ioſias roote out and deſtroie all ſuperſtition and relikes of idolatrie: with Dauid and Salomon finiſh and conſecrate to eternitie thy glorious Temple among thy people: and with them all moſt earneſtlie and continuallie to praie vnto thee for their ſaluation. That heere on earth for the time, after their vertuous example, dooing that which is good in thy ſight, reigning bleſſedlie, ruling prudentlie, and like a louing mother, and tender nurſſe, giuing my foſtermilke, the foode of thy word and Goſpell aboundantlie to all, in all places of my dominion, and endeuouring my ſelfe faithfullie to diſcharge the great truſt committed vnto me: when thy ſonne, to whome not onlie the ſea and windes, but all creatures are ſubiect, ſhall come as King of kings to require an accompt of the charge committed vnto me, I may be found faithfull, and not faile finallie in heauen, but in the pureneſſe of my virginitie, and holineſſe of mine innocencie, be preſented to the Lambe my ſouereigne Lord and onlie God, my heauenlie Bridegroome and ſpirituall ſpouſe, my euerlaſting King deere Chriſt, and onlie ſweet Sauiour Ieſus, there to ſee the Saincts, and to be a Sainct, and with all the holie Patriarches, Iudges, Kings, and Queenes, yea with all the Archangels, Angels, Saints, Martyrs, Confeſſors, Uirgins, and the whole companie of thy celeſtiall and bleſſed ſpirits, to reigne with him ouer ſpirituall powers and principalities for euer, and ſing the ſugred ſongs of my wedding-daie to my perpetuall ioie, and thine eternall praiſe, O moſt glorious Trinitie, the Father, the Son, and the holie Ghoſt, one inuiſible God almightie, bleſſed for euer and euer:
                     Amen, Amen.
                  
                  
                     
                     Another praier to be ſaid of the Queenes Maiestie.
                     
                     
                        BLeſſed art thou Lord God of Sabbaoth, for vnto thee apperteineth all magnificence, and power, and glorie, to thee belongeth all honour and authoritie.
                     For whatſoeuer is either in the heauens aboue, or in the earth beneath, it is thine. Thine, O Lord, is the kingdome, thou art aboue all Princes & Kings. Riches are thine, glorie is thine, and thou art Lord ouer all. In thee remaineth vertue and power, greatneſſe and gouernement.
                     O God of my fathers, and Lord of mercie, which haſt made all things by thy word, and by thy wiſdome appointed man to rule the creatures which thou haſt made, and to gouerne the world with equitie and iuſtice; I praiſe thee, and extoll thy glorious name, for appointing me thy ſeruant, to rule and gouerne this thy people committed vnto my charge.
                     Now therefore, gratious Lord, fauourablie behold me, that I may treade the path of truth, righteouſneſſe, and ſinceritie of hart in thy ſight.
                     Let me not abuſe mine authoritie, but gouerne with lenitie and gentleneſſe the people vnder me, that liuing a godlie and honeſt life, mankind may enioie their deſired peace.
                     Giue therefore vnto thy ſeruant an hart deſirous of inſtructions, that I may iudge the people, and diſcerne betweene good and euill, and neither declining to the right hand, or to the left, ſtoutelie and valiantlie mainteine the cauſe of the righteous.
                     Grant me counſell and aſſiſtance to doo ſuch things as are gratefull vnto thee, good for thy Church, and

profitable for my people and Common-weale.
                     Giue me thy wiſdome, and reiect me not from thy children: for I thy ſeruant and handmaiden am a fraile woman of a ſhort time, and full weake in the vnderſtanding of iudgements and the lawes.
                     Thou haſt choſen me a Gouernour of thy people, and a Iudge of thy ſonnes and daughters; ſend mee therefore wiſdome from thy ſacred heauens, and from the ſeate of thy magnificence, that it may be with me, and labour with me, whereby I may perceiue what is acceptable in thine eies, and learne that I haue no power of my ſelfe, but from thee, which art Almightie, and reigneſt ouer the kingdomes of men, giuing them at thy pleaſure.
                     Graunt that I neuer conceiue proudlie of my ſelfe, but may receiue in patience the diſcipline of thy Lawe.
                     Make me wiſe and circumſpect, that I neither offer iniurie to anie man, neither ſuffer anie to be iniuried, that ſo equitie may be mainteined, and iuſtice among men preſerued.
                     Let me at no time, vnder the ſhew and colour of equitie, vphold or countenance a wicked cauſe: neither yet without ſufficient examination and triall of both parties, giue ſentence againſt anie.
                     Allow me ſuch Counſellers, Gouernours, and Ouerſeers, as are of courage, fearing God, dealing vprightlie, hating couetouſneſſe; that by them the burthen, charge, and care which I ſuſteine, may be ſomewhat lightened.
                     Endue both me and them with thine holie ſpirit, that with earneſt ſtudie, and watchfull minds, we may diſcerne betweene matters, that no man through our negligence haue the ouerthrowe in a righteous cauſe, but that ſentence be rightlie pronounced betweene a man and his brother, and a ſtranger, without reſpect of anie perſon in iudgement.
                     
                        
Let vs heare as well the little as the great, and feare no man, becauſe the iudgement is thine, which ſtandeſt in the companie of iudges, and among the gods thou plaieſt the Iudge; for the iudgement is not of man, but of the Lord, and whatſoeuer we ſhall iudge it will come vpon vs.
                     Wherefore, let thy feare be with vs, that we may doo all things with care and circumſpection, that we prooue not children in vnderſtanding: neither giue our ſelues to luſts & pleaſures, but to eate our meate in due ſeaſon, and that for ſtrength, not for dronkennes.
                     For thou wilt make earneſt and diligent inquirie of all our works, and ſearch all our cogitations, becauſe we are thy ſeruants and deputies to gouerne, men of a verie ſhort life: and he which is to daie a King, to morowe may be dead: for we be all mortall, and ſubiect to one and the ſame corruption.
                     Beſides, an horrible iudgement is nigh for ſuch as walke not after the will of thee our God: for he that is moſt lowe, ſhall finde mercie: but the mightie ſhall be mightilie tormented: for thou which art the Lord ouer all, regardeſt not the perſon of anie, neither doeſt thou feare the greatneſſe of the mightie, becauſe as well the great as the ſmall are the workemanſhip of thine hands; thy care is equall ouer all, & thou giueſt to godlie Princes eternall happineſſe, which art the Iudge both of the quicke and dead, liuing and reigning with thy Son in the vnitie of the Spirit a God for euermore,
                     Amen.
                  
                  
                     Another.
                     
                        FOraſmuch as it hath pleaſed thee O King of kings, and Lord of lords, to appoint me among other, a Ruler of thy people: giue mee grace I beſeech thee ſo to miniſter the Common-weale, and ſo to execute mine office, that I may pleaſe thee, and hurt no man in all my dooings, but

iudge equallie, and iuſtlie rule according to thy will, ſhew my ſelfe a Mother vnto thy people, and ſo be haue my ſelfe in all mine enterpriſes, that I ſeeking thy glorie, the furtherance of thy bleſſed Goſpell, and the weale of thy ſubiects, may, when thou ſhalt render to euerie one according to his deedes, be found blameleſſe in thy ſight, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord:
                     Amen.
                  
                  
                     Another.
                     
                        OAlmightie God, Lord of heauen and earth, which haſt appointed me thy ſeruant to bee a gouernour of thy people, and a ruler ouer men: I moſt humblie beſeech thee ſend me thy wiſdome from aboue, whereby I may vprightlie iudge thy people, rightlie diſcerne betweene good and euill, and conſtantlie continue in dooing my dutie, without reſpect of perſons.
                     Giue me power and wiſdome to do that is gratefull in thy ſight, profitable for my ſubiects, and good for the continuance of peace.
                     Let me alwaies remember that I haue no power of my ſelfe, but of thee, and that the iudgement is not of man, but of thee my God, which ſtandeſt among the iudges, and plaieſt the Iudge among the gods.
                     Giue me grace likewiſe to conſider, that one daie, how ſoone I knowe not, thou wilt bring me to a reckning, and make diligent inquirie, how I haue behaued my ſelfe in my place and office.
                     For I thy ſeruant haue but a ſhort race to run, and ſuch is the ſtate of vs all; he which is to daie a King, to morrowe may be dead.
                     And foraſmuch as an horrible iudgement ſhall be giuen vpon ſuch as rule not vprightlie, nor walke after thy will; for mightie men ſhall mightiſie be tormented: thou being Lord ouer all, wilt ſpare no perſon, nor feare anie greatneſſe, for thou haſt made the ſmall and

great, and careſt for all alike.)
                     I beſeech thee gratious and eternall God, giue mee grace to learne what thy will is, and to deale wiſelie, to infer none iniurie vnto anie, nor to ſuffer anie to be iniured, to countenance none euill cauſe, nor to ſlide from the path of iuſtice.
                     For I thy ſeruant am a fraile perſon, of a ſhort time, and full weake in the vnderſtanding of iudgments, and the lawes.
                     Send me therefore wiſdome from the throne of thy Maieſtie, that ſhe may be with me, & labour with me, that I may knowe what is acceptable in thy ſight, and be led by hir in all my dooings, and preſerued by hir power, ſo ſhall my works be acceptable, and then ſhall I gouerne thy people righteouſlie in Chriſt my Lord and Sauiour,
                     Amen.

                        HEare mee, O LORD, thou high and mightie God, whoſe Maieſtie may not bee comprehended, whoſe worde is true, whoſe commandement is ſtrong, thou that rideſt vpon the Cherubins, & flieſt with the wings of the wind. Thou God of all mercie, moſt woorthie to be ſought, before whome the hoſts of heauen ſtand with trembling, whoſe ordinance is dreadfull, whoſe lookes drie vp the depths, whoſe hands rule the ſtarrie firmament, whoſe goodneſſe onelie giueth the fruits of the earth, whoſe wrath maketh the mountaines to melt, and conſumeth the wicked, whoſe truth beareth witneſſe, and mercie ſaueth the ſorowfull ſinner. Thou, thou incomprehenſible Creator, that neuer tookeſt beginning,

and wanteſt end. Sith of nothing thou haſt wrought me (with the woonders of the world) to thy moſt ſeemelie ſhape, and vouchſafeſt thy dririe death and paſſion, to drowne the danger of my ſinful deſerts, and haſt as a carefull captaine, cheriſhed my bodie with comfortable gifts vnto this preſent daie: continue, O God, ſuch goodneſſe towards me vnwoorthie, which doo here with contrite hart, and bowed knees appeale to the heigth of thy mercie, and louing kindneſſe, to accept mine vnequall thanks for the ſame: humblie beſeeching thy fatherlie goodneſſe, that thy holie hand may ſtil renew in me thy former gifts plentiouſlie powred vpon me from the prime of my birth vnto this preſent: not remembring, good Lord, mine vnwoorthineſſe of the ſame, nor frailtie of my paſſed yeeres, that ſpeaketh againſt me; but altering the miniſters of thy wrath into mild mercie. Grant I beſeech thee, that through the aſſiſtance of thy holie ſpirit I may be led to correct that is amiſſe, and that I may now perſeuere in ſetting, ordering, and reforming all my trauels, counſels, and ſtudies, as beſt may accord with thy bleſſed will, and cancell the bonds of my heauie charge; wherein aſſiſt me, moſt puiſſant Prince of all power, with thy prudent ſkill and heauenlie grace, that I may be truelie able to aduance iuſtice, and to hate wrong, and ſo be found a faithfull miniſter ouer thy people. In whom plant, I beſeech thee, thy heauenlie grace and feare, with obedience towards mee thy miniſter, and kindle in me the loue of thy holie ſpirit, that I may perſeuere in the truth of thy word, without doubt or wauering to the end. Grant this, oh mightie God of hoſts, for the merits and paſſion of thy deere ſonne my Lord and Sauior Ieſus Chriſt,
                     AMEN.

                        O GOD of my fathers, and Lord of mercie, which haſt made all things with thy word, and ordeined man through thy wiſdome, that he ſhould haue dominion ouer the creatures which thou haſt made, and gouerne the world according to equitie and righteouſneſſe, and execute iudgement with an vpright hart. Giue me wiſdome, which is euer ſitting aboue thy ſeate, and put me not out from among thy children. For I thy ſeruant and handmaid am a feeble perſon, and of a ſhort time, and yet leſſe in the vnderſtanding of iudgements and the lawes. And though a man be neuer ſo perfect among the children of men; yet if thy wiſdome be not with him, he ſhall be nothing regarded. Thou haſt choſen me to be a QVEENE vnto thy people, and the Iudge of thy ſonnes & daughters. Thou haſt commanded mee to maintaine thy Church, which from the beginning thou haſt choſen.
                     Oh ſend out of thy holie heauens therefore vnto me, that thy wiſdome, wherewith thou madeſt the world, gouerneſt thy works, and knoweſt what is acceptable in thy ſight, & right in thy commandements. Send hir, I ſaie, from the throne of thy Maieſtie, that ſhee may be with mee, and labour with me, that I may knowe what is acceptable in thy ſight, and right in thy commandements. For ſhe knoweth and vnderſtandeth all things, and ſhe ſhall leade me ſoberlie in all my works, and preſerue mee by hir power and glorie: ſo ſhall my works be acceptable, and then ſhall I gouern thy people righteouſlie, and be well and woorthie to ſit in my fathers throne,

O God, which art hid, and canſt not be ſeene with bodilie eies, nor comprehended with anie vnderſtanding, neither expreſſed with the tongue of men, or Angels. O my God, what is it to be righteous in thy ſight? It is that wee ſhould bee without ſinne before thee, which no man euer was ſince the fall of Adam. For which cauſe the holie Prophet DAVID ſaith in this wiſe: Enter not into iudgement with thy ſeruant, O Lord: for no fleſh is righteous in thy ſight. If then no fleſh be righteous in thy ſight; O vnhappie that I am, loden and burdened with ſinne, who ſhall haue pitie or compaſſion on mee, or whither ſhall I go? My ſinnes are euer before me, mine vnrighteouſneſſe condemneth me. What ſhall I doo? Shall I deſpaire? God forbid. For mercifull,

meeke, and louing is my Sauiour. My refuge therfore ſhall be in my God: for certaine I am, he will not forſake his owne image, neither wil he forſake the worke of his owne hands. Wherfore moſt meeke, louing, and mercifull Father, to thee come I all ſad and ſorowfull. But what ſhall I ſaie vnto thee? I will ſaie: Enter not into iudgement with thy ſeruant, O Lord: for no fleſh is righteous in thy ſight. And againe, I will with the Prophet powre out before thee the words of ſorrowe. I will hartilie beſeech thee, ſaieng: Haue mercie on me, O God, haue mercie on me, according to thy great mercie: not after the mercie of men, but after thy great mercie, which is incomprehenſible, which is vnmeaſurable, and which paſſeth all ſinnes without compariſon. According therefore vnto that thy great mercie, by the which thou haſt ſo loued the world, that thou gaueſt thy ſonne for it; by the which thou haſt taken awaie all our ſinnes; by the which through his croſſe thou haſt lightened all men; by the which alſo thou haſt reſtored all things in heauen, and in earth: waſh me, I ſaie, O Lord, waſh me in his bloud, reſtore me in his reſurrection, and iuſtifie me by thy grace and fauour, and the redemption which is in Chriſt,
                           AMEN.

                              THy mercie, O Lord, is the abundance of pitie; thy compaſſions are the works and proceſſe of thy mercie; by the one thou lookeſt gentlie on the poore and wretched: by the other thou forgiueſt the multitude of ſinnes. O ſweet, and mercifull Sauiour

Ieſus Chriſt, the ſorowfull and penitent ſinner Marie Magdalen came proſtrate before thy feet, ſhe waſhed them with hir bitter teares, ſhe wiped them with the heares of hir head: thou forgaueſt all hir ſinnes, and ſenteſt hir awaie in peace: this was, good Lord, one of thy compaſſions. Peter thriſe denied thee; and forſooke thee with an oth: thou mercifullie lookedſt on him, and he beholding thee bitterlie wept: and thou Lord forgaueſt him; which was another of thy compaſſions. The theefe on the Croſſe was ſaued with one word: Paule in the furious madneſſe of perſecution was called, and by and by was filled with the holie Ghoſt: theſe all Lord are thy pitifull compaſſions.
                           Sith therefore that thou art the ſame our GOD, with whome is no alteration, neither ſhadowe of change; and ſith there is but one Mediatour and attonement betweene God and man, that is Chriſt Ieſus, which endureth for euer; why dooſt thou not powre out thy plentious compaſſions vpon vs, as well as thou didſt vpon our forefathers? Why ſtandeſt thou ſo far, O Lord, and hideſt thy face in the needfull tune of trouble? Haſt thou forſaken vs? Or are all thy mercies ſpent, and none left? O Lord my God, I hartilie beſeech thee, & moſt humblie praie thee, that thou wilt, according to the multitude of thy compaſſions, wipe awaie all mine iniquities: that as thou haſt drawne and receiued innumerable ſinners vnto thee, and haſt made them righteous in thy ſight: euen ſo thou wilt vouchſafe to drawe and take me, and alſo to make mee righteous through thy grace, and ſo to clenſe and purifie my hart; that after all mine iniquities and vncleanneſſe put out, it may be as a cleane table, in the which thy finger, O GOD, may write the lawe of thy loue and charitie,
                           AMEN.

For now feele I mine old cankered and feſtered ſores of ſinne readie to breake foorth in me, to my vtter confuſion. Behold good Lord, all my deſires, and all my lamentable and ſorowfull ſighes, I powre them all before thee; crieng and ſaieng, O Lord cleanſe me from my ſinnes: for I am vncleane and filthie before thee. Increaſe therefore thy light in me, that I may be a veſſell of thy grace: kindle my hart with thy loue; put out all feare: for perfect loue expelleth feare. Let the loue of the world, the loue of the fleſh, the loue of vaine-glorie, and the loue of my ſelfe, vtterlie depart from me: that I may (through thy mercie) be cleanſed from mine iniquities, by the which I haue offended thee. Cleanſe me therefore, O Lord, with the water of thy gratious fauour, of which water he that drinketh, ſhall no more thirſt, but it ſhall be made in him a fountaine of liuing water, running and flowing into eternall life. Cleanſe mee I ſaie, O Lord, with the water of thy weeping teares; cleanſe me with the comfortable waters of thy ſacred Scriptures, that I may be numbred among them, vnto whome thou ſaiedſt: Now are yee cleane through the words that I haue ſpoken to you:

                              O Mercifull God, how manie ſinnes haue I don in thy ſight, which I would in no wiſe haue done before mortall men? I feared men more than thee, becauſe I was blind, and loued blindneſſe. I had onlie eies of fleſh, therfore did I onlie feare and looke on men which are fleſh. O my God, behold, I ſtand before thy face, that I might finde mercie. I ſtand before thy goodneſſe and benignitie, looking for thy fauorable anſwere: haue mercie therefore on me. Thou ſaiedſt to Zache, This daie I will abide in thy houſe, and he ioifullie receiuing thee, ſaid; Lord, the halfe of my goods I giue to the poore, and if I haue done anie man wrong, I will reſtore him fourefold. But Lord Ieſu, I will not part halfe that I haue, but I bequeath my ſelfe wholie vnto thee, reſeruing nothing from thee, promiſing to ſerue thee for euer with a cleane and pure hart. O ſweet Lord Ieſus, what ſaweſt thou in Zache? euen thine owne image, for he had caſt off the image of the diuell, which before was on him, and had put on him thine image. If then thou didſt ſee in Zache, by putting from him the image of the diuell, that which did drawe thee to his houſe; take then from me, ſweet Ieſus, all my ſinnes and wickedneſſe; all I praie thee, that none may remaine in me, which may keepe thee from me; that I may put off, as Zache did, that euill which is in me; that thou maiſt ſee in me, which thou

ſaweſt in Zache, that when thou ſhalt call me out of the figtree of this miſerable world, thou maiſt ſaie vnto me, Come downe, for this daie I will abide with thee:

It is loſt, gone, and ſold vnder ſinne. It is ſtonie, yea harder than the Flint or Adamant ſtone, which relented and yeelded at thy ſonnes death. What now Lord? What ſhall I ſaie? A pure hart create in me, a fleſhie hart, a mollified and ſoft hart, an humble hart, a penitent hart, a mercifull hart, a deuout hart, a religious and zealous hart: yea and ſuch a hart as will loue thee aboue all things. Create therefore good Lord ſuch a hart in me, that it may be of ſuch efficacie through thy grace, as nature is not able to make it. Giue me alſo a right ſpirit, that I may loue and worſhip thee, which art the chiefe and principall ſpirit. For thou art a ſpirit, and wilt be worſhipped in ſpirit and veritie. My ſoule, good Lord, is alſo a ſpirit, and ſo made of thee, that of it ſelfe it is right. For of hir owne nature ſhe loueth thee aboue hir ſelfe, and deſireth all things for thy glorie; ſo that hir owne naturall loue is right, becauſe it commeth of thee. Make ſtedfaſt therefore in me, O Lord, through thy gratious fauour, this ſpirit; that it may, according to his owne nature, leade and keepe me in the waie of thy commandements;

and that by it my heart may be ſo inflamed with heauenlie loue, that it may cauſe me to ſigh vnto thee, to embrace thee continuallie, and neuer to forſake thee; but alwaies to be firme and conſtant in thee. Giue me therefore an vpright ſpirit, not ſeeking hir owne glorie, but thy will and glorie. Renew it in me, I praie thee good Lord; renew it I ſaie, for my ſins haue quenched the firſt that thou gaueſt me,
                           AMEN.

I graunt therefore Lord, and confeſſe, that againſt thee onlie I haue offended, and haue done that which is euill in thy ſight. Haue mercie therefore on me O Lord, haue mercie. Expreſſe and ſhewe foorth thine omnipotencie in me, that thou maiſt be iuſtified in thy words. For it is written, Thou cameſt not to call the righteous, but ſinners to repentance. Graunt me therefore good Lord a true repentant hart, and iuſtifie me according to thy words. Call me, receiue me, and giue me thy grace; ſo that thereby I may do the works of repentance. Thou ſaiedſt, When I am lifted vp from the earth, I will drawe all vnto my ſelfe. Uerifie Lord the words on me, drawe me after thee, and let me run with thee in the ſweeteneſſe of thine ointments. Againe, thou ſaiedſt, Come vnto me all yee that labour, and are loden, and I will eaſe you. Behold

my Lord and my God, I a ſinner do come vnto thee, all loden with ſinnes, daie and night, labouring in the ſorowe of my hart for thy grace and mercie. Refreſh and eaſe me therefore good Lord, that thou maiſt be iuſtified and proued, when thou art iudged. For there are manie, which ſaie, There is no helpe for him in his God. Ouercome Lord theſe perſons, when thou art thus iudged of them, and forſake not me at anie time: but giue to me thy creature thy mercie and pardon, and then are they vanquiſhed which ſaie, There is no helpe for him in his God,

What is thy ſauing health, but Ieſus Chriſt thy onlie ſonne, which is verie God and euerlaſting life? And forſomuch as thou haſt bin ſo louing and liberall a father, as to giue him vnto the death of the croſſe, and there to offer him for me; why ſhould I be aſhamed to aſke him of thee, whome thou haſt giuen for me? Giue me therefore thy principall ſpirit, that I may reioice in thy ſauing health. And forſomuch as in thy holie word thou biddeſt me aſke and knocke, euen till I ſee me

importunate, and what can I aſke that ſhould be more wholeſome to me, than that thou ſhouldeſt make me reioice in thy ſonne our ſauing health?

                              WHat meaneth it to ſaie, Thou loueſt truth; but that of thy gratious mercie thou makeſt vs promiſes, and fulfilleſt them for thy truths ſake? Thou didſt promiſe vnto Abraham a ſonne when he was aged: thou fulfilledſt thy promiſe in old and barren Sara, becauſe thou loueſt truth. Thou madeſt promiſe vnto Dauid thy ſeruant, ſaieng: Of the fruit of thy bodie will I ſet vpon the regall throne: and it came to paſſe, becauſe thou loueſt truth. Thou haſt promiſed vnto ſinners, which will come vnto thee, forgiueneſſe and fauour, and thou haſt neuer defrauded anie man: for thou loueſt truth. There are other innumerable promiſes, in the which thou haſt euer bene faithfull, becauſe thou loueſt truth. Loue therefore, O father of mercies, this truth in me, which with repentant hart turneth to thee. Behold therefore thy creature, in whome thou maiſt keepe it, and to whome thou

maiſt forgiue manie ſinnes. Spare good Lord, ſpare thy ſeruant, and command me to be of the number of the babes; that the vnknowne things of thy wiſdome, which thou haſt opened vnto me, may lead me vnto the fountaine of wiſdome, which is on high; that thou maiſt be praiſed in the works of thy mercie, which thou dooeſt exerciſe towards thy ſeruant, O LORD, which neuer forſakeſt them that truſt in thee:

                              MY mouth, Lord, ſhall ſhew foorth thy glorious fame. For I knowe it to be moſt acceptable before thee, ſeeing thou haſt declared it by the mouth of the Prophet, ſaieng: The ſacrifice of praiſe ſhall glorifie me; by which meane (ſaith the Lord) I ſhall be entiſed to ſhew him my ſauing health. Pſal. 48. Therefore will I offer praiſe vnto thee for my ſinnes, euen the praiſe of infants and ſucklings. And why ſhall I offer praiſe for my ſinnes, rather than ſacrifice? Bicauſe thou delighteſt not in burnt ſacrifice. For if thou hadſt deſired ſacrifice, I had ſurelie offered them: but thou delighteſt not in them. And againe, thou ſaiedſt, I require mercie, and not ſacrifice. Oſe. 6. Therefore my mouth ſhall ſhew foorth thy praiſe, bicauſe thereby I doo ſhew foorth thy honour, and it ſheweth me through thy grace the waie to my ſauing health. O Lord, thou madeſt the bodie for the ſpirit, therfore ſeekeſt thou ſpirituall things, and not bodilie things. For thou ſaieſt, My ſonne giue thy hart vnto me. Prou. 23.

which is the ſacrifice that pleaſeth thee. Let me therefore offer vnto thee, O Lord, a hart repenting and ſorrowing for my ſinnes; and inflame it with a deſired loue of heauenlie things, and then wilt thou deſire no more of me: for with ſuch ſacrifices wilt thou, O Lord, be pleaſed,

I appeale therfore, O Lord, to thy mercie, crieng out with the prodigall and vnthriftie ſonne, ſaieng: O Father, I haue ſinned againſt heauen, and before thee; haue mercie therefore, haue mercie on me; not bicauſe I haue deſerued thy mercie, but bicauſe thou art mercifull. Sith therefore thou art mercifull, what art thou, but euen the verie mercie it ſelfe? And what am I but verie miſerie? Behold therefore, O God, which art mercie, behold miſerie is before thee. What ſhalt thou doo, O mercie? Trulie thy works. Canſt thou go backe from thy nature? And what is thy nature? Uerelie to

take awaie miſerie. Haue mercie therefore on mee, O God. God, which art mercie, take awaie my miſerie: for the depth of miſerie requireth the depth of mercie. The depth of ſinne requireth the depth of grace and fauour. Greater is the depth of mercie, than the depth of miſerie. Let therfore, good Lord, the one depth ſwallowe vp the other. Let the bottomleſſe depth of mercie ſwallowe vp the depth of miſerie,

Surelie thou paſſeſt in thine abundant pitie, both the deſeruings and alſo the deſires of them that praie vnto thee. For thou giueſt more than man can deſire. The woman of Canaan followed thee, ſhe cried and made a pitious noiſe; ſhe mooued thy Diſciples to compaſſion, & worſhipped thee, and ſaid: Lord helpe me; but yet wouldeſt thou not anſwere. Yet ſhee truſting in thy mercie, praied againe, ſaieng: Lord helpe me. Unto whoſe importunitie thou diddeſt anſwere, ſaieng: It is not good to take the childrens bread, and caſt it vnto dogs. O Lord, who would not haue beene confounded, and haue gotten him awaie at theſe thy words? And yet did this woman continue ſtill in praier, and ſaid: It is truth Lord that thou ſaieſt: it is not meete to caſt the childrens bread vnto dogs. But yet Lord, the dogs doo eate of the crums which fall from the childrens table. And thou Lord reioicing

in hir great conſtancie, didſt ſaie: O woman, great is thy faith, be it vnto thee as thou deſireſt. Now therefore ſweet and mercifull Lord Ieſu, as thou diddeſt vouchſafe to accept and heare the praier of Cornelius, and of this woman of Canaan; ſo I hartilie beſeech thee to heare my humble praiers, which I make daie and night before thee; not onelie that thou ſhouldeſt deliuer me from bodilie oppreſſions, but alſo from the ſpirituall power of the diuell, that after this mortall life I may come to thy bleſſed preſence, in the euerlaſting kingdome, where thou reigneſt God with the Father, and the holie Ghoſt:

Deliuer me therefore O Lord from the waie of ſinners, and my tongue ſhall magnifie thy righteouſneſſe; and my lips and my mouth ſhall ſhew foorth thy praiſe. Thou haſt the key of Dauid, which ſhutteſt, and no man openeth; and openeſt, and no man ſhutteth. Therefore open thou my lips, as thou haſt opened the mouths of infants, out of whoſe mouths thou haſt eſtabliſhed thy praiſe. Trulie the Prophets and Apoſtles, and all other thy Saints praiſed thee, & deſpiſed themſelues. The ſucklings extoll thy fame and glorie, which they knowe through thy heauenlie

Thy beloued haue openlie preached thy bountious gentleneſſe, and mercifull fauour, which thou ſheweſt in thy deere ſonne vnto all the world. Now therefore mercifull God, giue me true humilitie, that thou maiſt ſtabliſh thy praiſe by my mouth. Make me as one of the infants and ſucklings, that I may euer hang on the paps of thy wiſdome. For thy paps, O Lord, are better than wine, and thy wiſdome better than riches. Make me as one of thy friends or beloued, that I may conſtantlie abide in thee, that my mouth and voice may among the ſucklings extoll and ſet foorth thy praiſe, ſaieng and ſinging, Ozanna in the higheſt,

Thy will is, that we beleeue that he, whome thou haſt ſent, is come in the fleſh. And thy will is, that we imitate and keepe his ſaieng. Thy will is alſo, that we ſhould heare him. For thou ſpakeſt from heauen, ſaieng: This is my welbeloued Sonne, in whome I delight, heare him. Giue me therefore, O heauenlie father, a ſtedfaſt faith, a ſtrong faith, yea ſuch a faith, that no tribulation, that no vexation, that no perſecution may cauſe me to denie thy Son whom thou haſt ſent: but that I may with a pure and conſtant faith confeſſe him to be come in the fleſh, for the redemption of the world; and that I may imitate and folowe him, that I may keepe his ſaieng, who was deliuered for my ſinnes, and was raiſed againe for my iuſtification. Giue me alſo, O holie father, a perfect

hearing, and not a corrupt hearing; but that I may, through the teaching of the holie Ghoſt, heare thee out of the Prophets, out of the Apoſtles, out of the pen of the Euangeliſts, and out of the mouth of thy Spouſe the Catholike Church: to whome thou ſaiedſt, I will ſend you a comforter, euen my ſpirit, which ſhall leade you into all truth.

                              A Broken and troubled ſpirit, and not broken and troubled fleſh pleaſeth thee O Lord. For the fleſh is broken and vexed, becauſe it hath not the carnall things that it deſireth, or elſe feeleth in it ſelfe things which it hateth. The ſpirit is broken and vnquieted for his fault, becauſe it hath offended againſt God, whom it loueth. He ſoroweth that he hath ſinned againſt his maker and redeemer, and that he hath not regarded ſuch a good and louing father. This broken and ſorowing ſpirit, is vnto thee, O Lord, a ſacrifice of moſt ſweet ſauour, which notwithſtanding hath his confection of moſt bitter ſpices, euen of the remembrance of his ſinnes. For when our ſinnes are gathered together into the morter of the hart, and beaten with the peſtle of compunction, and made into powder, and moiſtened with the water of teares, therof is made an ointment, and ſacrifice moſt ſweet, which being offered to thee, O Lord, thou wilt not deſpiſe. Marie Magdalen, which was a great ſinner, made

ſuch an ointment, and put it into the Alablaſter boxe of hir hart. She feared not to enter into the Phariſes houſe, and there humbling hir ſelfe at thy feete, ſweet Lord, waſhed them with hir teares, wiped them with hir heare, and annointed them with moſt pretious ointment, and ceaſſed not to kiſſe them. Surelie Lord, hir ſacrifice was right acceptable, and pleaſed thee, ſo that thou preferredſt it aboue the Phariſie, which in his owne ſight was righteous. O Lord, great is thy power, great is thy might, which declareth it ſelfe moſt chieflie in ſparing and hauing compaſſion on ſinners: ſhewing to vs, that a contrite and humble hart thou wilt not deſpiſe.
                           Accept therefore ſweete Lord Ieſu, this my ſacrifice of praiſe, proceeding out of a broken and ſorowfull hart. And if it be vnperfect, amend thou the fault, mercifull Lord, which onlie art of power to doo it; that it may be an holie and acceptable ſacrifice, inflamed with the feruent heate of thy bountious charitie; that it may be acceptable vnto thee, or at the leaſt, that thou deſpiſe it not. I knowe well that I ſhall find fauour in thy ſight, and that heereafter none of thy Saincts, either in heauen or in earth, ſhall deſpiſe me. Accompliſh therefore in me euen now O Lord, that which I ſo oft do craue of thee, which is, that thou wilt haue compaſſion on me, according to thy great mercie; and that alſo thou wilt receiue me for a ſacrifice of righteouſneſſe, for a holie oblation, for a burnt ſacrifice of good liuing, and for a Calfe to be offered vpon thine Altar or Croſſe: by the which I may paſſe this vale of miſerie, vnto that ioie, which thou prepareſt for them that loue thee,

I will euer looke vpon the Lord, for he ſhalbe on my right

hand, that I be not mooued. For this my hart is glad, and my tongue reioiceth, yea moreouer my fleſh ſhall reſt in hope,
                           Amen.

Lord God deliuer me from the hand of ſinners, and from the Lawe-breaker, and the wicked dooer: for thou Lord art my patience, thou art my hope, euen from my youth. In thee I am confirmed euen from my mothers wombe: thou art my protector, in thee ſhall be my ſong for euer and euer,
                           Amen.

                           EUER my tongue ſhall be telling of thy rich mercie and woonderous works O Lord, for thou haſt cauſed me to paſſe through fire and water, and led me into a freſh place; thou haſt giuen my ſoule life, and haſt not ſuffered my feete to fall. According to the multitude of my ſorowes, thy comforts haue made my ſoule merrie. My ſoule is like a Sparowe taken out of the Fowlers ſnare. Thou haſt deliuered my life from death, and my hands from bloud, that I may pleaſe thee O Lord in the light of the liuing,
                           Amen.

                           THOU art iuſt, O Lord, and all thy commandements be true; and all thy waies mercie, truth and iudgement. And now Lord be mindfull of me, take not reuengement of my ſinnes, remember not mine offences, neither the offences of my fathers, becauſe we haue not obeied thy precepts. Giue me an hart of vnderſtanding, and ſet thy feare alwaies

before mine eies, that I may be obedient in word, deed and thought, to all that is thy will. Lord giue vnto me the power of thy holie ſpirit, to rule and gouerne thy people committed to my charge, in all godlie feare, and knowledge of thy word, and that I may be vnto them an example in all godlineſſe and vertue, to the praiſe of thy holie name,
                           Amen.

Quicken me according to thy word, according to thy mercie releeue me; and I will keepe the teſtimonies of thy lips. Helpe me Lord, ſo ſhall I be ſafe, and I will from hencefoorth ſtudie thy righteouſneſſe. Thy mercies are manie O Lord, according to thy word reſtore my health,
                           AMEN.

Deliuer me from the wicked man: let not the foote of pride come vpon me, and to vaine-glorie giue me not. Take from me all ſinfull luſts: let no deſire of vncleanneſſe take hold vpon me: giue me not ouer to an vnſhamefaſt and obſtinate mind, but correct me in thy mercie: for into thy hands I commit me,
                           Amen.

And now, O Lord, truſting in thy mercie, I bow the knees of my hart, beſeeching thee of thy goodneſſe, deſtroie me not togither with mine iniquitie. For the dead, whoſe ſoules are out of their bodies, can neither praiſe nor thanke thee: but the ſorowfull hart, and the thirſtie ſoule aſcribe praiſe vnto thee. O Lord, I powre my praiers before thee, and require mercie in thy ſight; ſaue me which am vnwoorthie, and reſerue not eternall puniſhment for mee. For thine owne ſake I aſke it, and will praiſe thee all the daies of my life,
                           Amen.

my feet, and a lampe of light vnto my paths, ſo ſhall I not erre from the right waie: but walke like a pure and wiſe virgin with an vpright hart, chaſte mind, and cleane conſcience, and ſingle eie before thee this daie and euermore,

Thou which madeſt the heauens, & all things comprehended in them, bow downe thine eare and heare, open thine eies and behold: ſaue mee from the hand of mine aduerſaries, ſuffer no euill to happen vnto me, that all the people may knowe that thou alone art my God,

Waſh awaie my ſinnes with the moſt pretious bloud of thy holie paſſion: make me rich in thy mercie, and my faith ſo ſtrong in thee, that aſſiſted with thy grace and holie ſpirit, to all duties and works in this life towards thee, I may enioie afterwards the glorie of thy bleſſed kingdome, with thy holie Saints and pure Uirgins in euerlaſting honour and triumph,

                           O Roote of Ieſſe, my Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, which haſt redeemed all mankind from ſinne, death and hell, thou which haſt ſaid: I am the waie, truth, and life. The waie in doctrine, commandements, and examples; truth in promiſes; life in reward. I praie thee by thine ineffable loue, wherewith thou haſt vouchſafed wholie to beſtowe thy ſelfe for our ſecuritie; that thou wilt not ſuffer me euer to ſtraie from thee, bicauſe thou art the waie: nor at anie time to diſtruſt thy promſes, which art the truth, and performeſt whatſoeuer thou promiſeſt: neither let me reſt in anie other thing, bicauſe thou art eternall life, without the which there is nothing that ought to be deſired, neither in heauen nor in earth.
                     By thee we learne the ſure and expedient paſſage

vnto true helth, that we wander no longer in the Laberinth of this world. Thou haſt exactlie taught what to beleeue, and what to doo, what to hope for, and in whom we ought to reſt. By thee wee learne how wee were of that firſt Adam vnfortunatelie borne: by thee we are aſſured there is no hope of health but through faith in thee: that thou art the onlie brightneſſe, which giueſt light to all men trauelling the darke deſarts of this world, where is nothing but a profound dimneſſe, wherby we neither ſee our calamities, nor frō whence we ought to ſeeke remedie of our euill. Thou vouchſafedſt to deſcend into the earth, & diſdainedſt not to take our nature vpon thee, that by thy doctrine thou mighteſt ſhake off the dimneſſe of our ignorance: by thy commandements mighteſt direct our feete in the waie of truth & peace. By the examples of thy life thou haſt ſhewed vs the waie to immortalitie, and by thy ſteps haſt reſtored to vs a plaine, eaſie, & profitable waie, out of an vneeuen and rough waie. So thou art made vnto vs a waie, which knoweth no error, in the which, leaſt we ſhould be wearie, thou haſt vouchſafed to vphold vs in thy benignitie with great & ſure promiſes. For who can be wearie, accounting himſelfe redie through thy ſteps to enter thy heauenlie heritage? Therefore whileſt we be in this iournie, thou wouldeſt be a ſure hope vnto vs, to be in ſteed of a ſtaffe vnto vs, wherewith we are ſuſtained. Neither was thy goodnes content with this, but knowing the weakneſſe of our fleſh in the meane while, with the comfort of thy ſpirit dooeſt ſo refreſh our ſtrength, whereby we run cheerefullie. And as thou being made vnto vs the waie, dooeſt driue awaie all errour: ſo being truth dooeſt thou take awaie all diſtruſt. Finallie, being made life vnto vs, dooeſt reuiue the dead in ſinne, to liue by thy ſpirit, releeuing all things, vntill in the reſurrection, all mortalitie vtterlie aboliſhed, we may alwaies liue with thee,

and in thee, when Chriſt ſhall be to vs all in all. For eternall life is, to knowe the Father, the Sonne, and the holie Ghoſt to be one true God; where now thorough faith we behold onlie in a glaſſe and riddle. And then ſeeing more felowlie the glorie of the Lord, wee ſhall be tranſformed into the ſame image.
                     Therefore I beſeech thee, moſt mercifull Sauiour, that thou wouldeſt nouriſh faith in thy ſeruant, that I may neuer wauer in thy heauenlie doctrine. Increaſe obedience, that I neuer turne from thy precepts; fortifie conſtancie, that entring into thy ſteps, I be not pulled backe, nor through the terrour or intiſements of Satan ouerthrowne, but may perſeuere in thee, which art the true waie, vnto death. Build my ſure truſt, that accuſtomed with thy promiſes, I neuer waxe old in the exerciſe of vertue: but forgetting thoſe things which are paſt, I may cōtinuallie ſtriue to com to perfecter. Accept my contrite hart, the woonted ſacrifice of thy delight, & the oblation of theſe my petitions, granting the ſumme of my requeſts. Blot out all mine offences for thine owne ſake, and increaſe thy grace in me, that I may in all things carrie vpright ſwaie and equall iudgement: gouerne thy people in the light of thy word, and feare of thy lawes, and dailie more and more die to my ſelfe, and liue and be led by thy ſpirit, fearing nothing but thee, than the which nothing is greater or mightier: louing nothing beſide thee, than whom nothing is more to be beloued: glorieng in nothing but in thee, which art the glorie of all Saints: requiring nothing beſide thee, which art the beſt: deſiring nothing but thee, which art the full and perfect felicitie with the Father and the holie Ghoſt, aboue the ſtarrie firmament: to whome be praiſe both now and euer,
                     Amen.

                        Wherein almightie GOD (after a diuine ſort ſpeaking vnto hir Maieſtie, as he ſometimes did vnto Dauid, though not in ſo myſticall maner) doth firſt declare his 1 mercifull prouidence in preſeruing hir, and his gratious goodneſſe in exalting hir to the Crowne, exhorting hir therewithall, humblie to acknowledge his ſouereigntie ouer all earthlie powers, and to worſhip him. Secondlie, 2 he deſcribeth vnto hir Grace, the woorthie properties that are required to bee in euerie godlie Prince, and wiſe Gouernour, for the maintenance of his glorie, and their eſtates. Thirdlie, he exhorteth hir Maieſtie to 3 the faithfull diſcharge of hir office and dutie in his feare and ſeruice, to the increaſe of vertue, and ſuppreſsing of vice. And ſo ſhewing the commodities that will inſue thereby to hir and hir people, he fourthlie promiſeth, not 4 onelie to be hir continuall defender againſt all hir enimies; but alſo to bleſſe hir, and hir Realme, with manie large, ſweet and comfortable benefits, both corporall & celeſtiall, and to make hir partaker of all his ancient mercies, promiſed long ſince to hir father Dauid; namelie, vpon this condition: if finallie ſhe perſeuere in the 5 perfect loue and due obedience of hir ſpirituall ſpouſe Chriſt Ieſus.

                              ELIZABETH, thou Uirgin mine, the KINGS Daughter, and faireſt among women; moſt full of beautie and maieſtie: attend a litle to my Heaſt, and marke what I ſhall ſay. Thou art my Daughter in deede, this daie haue I begotten thee, and eſpouſed thee to thy King CHRIST, my Sonne; crowned thee with my gifts, and appointed thee QVEENE, to reigne vpon my holie mount Zion.
                        Behold, I which am the onlie Lord (by full right and authoritie) of all men; and doo my ſelfe gouerne the Empires and Kingdoms, as the greateſt King of all, and moſt mightie Monarch of the whole world: euen I the moſt high God, and celeſtiall father, haue elected thee a choſen veſſell of high honour and price in my houſe, and to that end haue mightilie preſerued thee, and miraculouſlie deliuered thee out of ſo manie & ſo great dangers, and now at the laſt haue brought into thy ſubiection the people, ouer whome thou haſt authoritie.
                        It is I, and none other, which haue conſecrated thee vnto my ſelfe; and annointed thee with holie oile, to be the Queene, the Mother, and the Nurſſe of my people in Iſrael: and who onlie haue giuen thee this moſt excellent and goodlie heritage, which thou poſſeſſeſt in peace.
                        
                           
Thee I ſaie, O Daughter ELIZABETH, haue I raiſed vp, and choſen out a pure and perfect virgin from the reſt of the whole people, and that becauſe I loued thee moſt deerelie aboue them all; ſo that now thou maieſt worthilie reioice and glorie of thy dignitie and honour, yet by my ſingular power and benefit, and for none other cauſe, but that it hath pleaſed me thy God to exalt thee aboue others, and to embrace and receiue thee into my ſpeciall grace and fauour.
                        Therefore, to the intent I might alwaies vſe thy diligent ſeruice, faithfull miniſterie, and dutifull endeuour in this great buſineſſe, and high office of a Queene and kinglie Gouernour; and that by thy power receiued from me, my people may be defended and cheriſhed: behold, I haue ordeined a Lampe for thee mine annointed, and powred foorth vpon thee all my bountie, that none is able to be compared vnto thee: yea I haue adorned thee moſt bountifullie and beautifullie with all my gifts and graces incomparable, which ſhall neuer be taken from thee.
                        Now then O deere daughter, conſider diligentlie with thy ſelfe awhile, what maner of huſband thou art coupled and conioined vnto: learne of him alone, (thy ſpouſe Chriſt mine onlie Son I meane) to whom as this daie I married thee, what he requireth of thee: namelie, that thou ſhouldeſt forget thine owne Nation, thy Fathers houſe, and all other worldlie things, now that thou art come vnder his authoritie, and into the familie and ſpirituall ſocietie of thy heauenlie Bridegroome.
                        Now therefore, I ſaie, bee wiſe O QVEENE, bee learned thou Iudge of the earth, that with all the Emperours, Kings, and Potentats of the world, thou maiſt giue place vnto the Lord, and reſigne vp vnto him the honour of all glorie and power. Giue (I ſaie) vnto the GOD of gods, and King of kings, euen the

verie God of glorie, the maieſtie and dominion due vnto his name, and fall downe and worſhip him: doo vnto him all poſſible reuerence, that giueth power to his people, and bleſſeth both prince and ſubiect with his continuall benefits: and reioice in him with feare and trembling.
                        O kiſſe this my ſonne Chriſt thy ſpouſe betimes, leaſt he be angrie, and then thou ſuddenly periſh, when his wrath ſhall flame foorth. Worſhip the Lord I ſaie with due worſhip, and truſt in him alone, as ſhe that wholie dependeth vpon his mercie, fauour, and protection: ſo ſhalt thou be bleſſed, and thy throne ſhall neuer be ſhaken.
                        Confeſſe who it is that hath ſet thee in ſo high a place far aboue other men that are thy ſubiects, and remember alſo this, that I the moſt high God am preſent with thee, and thine aſſemblie of States and Senatours; who haue not debarred my ſelfe of mine authoritie ouer you, neither am I preſent as an idle beholder, but as your Iudge alſo.
                        And knowe this aſſuredlie, that as you are honoured in deed with that name (Gods,) whereby mine authoritie ouer all men is declared. And albeit I haue embraced you with ſpeciall fauour, as a father his children; yet thinke that I haue not exempted you from my power and authoritie: and that though you be Princes and Magiſtrates, yet knowe that you are mortall, euen as other men: yea remember that you ſhall once die, and ſhall ſtand at my iudgement-ſeate, euen as euerie moſt vile and poore man, to render and giue an accompt of your ſtewardſhip, and of all things done in the fleſh.

                           BEware therefore that yee abuſe not this authoritie giuen vnto you by me, vnder certaine lawes and conditions. See that you directlie

followe the waies that I haue appointed you to walke in, and take heed that you be not drawne awaie to the right hand, or to the left, with the error of the wicked, to forſake my lawes and ordinances, and to fall from me your God, who haue exalted you.
                        For be you ſure that I haue placed you in this ſeate vpon this condition, and giuen it vnto you in plaine charge and commandement, that you ſhould decree iuſt lawes, and execute iudgement by right and equitie, without fauour, parcialitie, or regard to anie partie: that you ſhould deuiſe all manner of godlineſſe, and ſhew your ſelues openlie to be freends to vertue, and foes to vice, and to weigh nothing but equitie and iuſtice in your balance.
                        That as the verie lawe of Nature doth require, you ſhould releeue them that are ſpoiled by violence, defend the fatherleſſe, mainteine the poore againſt the iniuries of the rich: deliuer the miſerable from the hands of the wicked, and ſee diligentlie that the wringing worldlings, and cruell extortioners exerciſe not their tyrannie and oppreſſions continuallie ouer the godlie and feeble of my people.
                        Moreouer, that you ſhould make diligent inquiſition for bloudſhead and murther, to reuenge it, carefullie ſearch out wickedneſſe and abhomination, to condemne it, to execute the traytor, murtherer, and theefe, to pull the praie out of the teeth of the ſpoiler, to breake downe the power of the wicked mightie ones, to deſtroie the workers of iniquitie, and vtterlie to roote out ſinne and vngodlineſſe from the earth: euen all ſuch as conſpire againſt the ſoules of the righteous, & abuſing iuſtice by colour of lawe, gather themſelues together to ſit & condemne the innocent bloud, and trouble my heritage.
                        Finallie, it is I that in the diſordered ſtate of the world, which ſeemed to be vtterlie void of iuſtice, haue

ſet thee, O Daughter of my people, now at the laſt to reſtore the ſame to that ancient and moſt right godlie order of iuſtice, religion and faith, that thou ſhouldeſt be a defence and fortreſſe among my people, and followe me thy God with great cheerefulneſſe, and haue thy delight fullie fixed in my lawes and ſtatutes daie and night, that being well exerciſed therein, as it behooueth, thou maiſt be able to knowe, ſift and trie the waies of all men, and iudge betwixt right and wrong.
                     
                     
                        CAP. III.
                        
                           HArken therefore vnto me, O Daughter, and take heed that thou haue nothing to do with the ſtoole of wickedneſſe: and that the throne of iniquitie & tyrannicall domination, which forgeth wrong for a lawe, and adioineth authoritie to moſt wicked decrees, haue no fellowſhip nor be agreeable with thee.
                        And bicauſe the wicked doo wander on euerie ſide, when the woorſt men are exalted into the higheſt place of honour and offices in the Common-weale: therfore I aduiſe and counſell thee betimes, to expell and thruſt out of thy Court and houſe, all the vnwoorthie and vngodlie men, flatterers, paraſites, ieſters, atheiſts, and reuengers of bloud: and place the woorthie and godlie in their roomes, that they may ſit among the Princes of my people, and be aſſiſtant vnto thee.
                        O make much of them that feare the Lord, & let all thy delight be vpon my Saints, which are on earth: be carefull alwaie to preſerue the vertuous, and exalt the beſt & moſt woorthie perſons. Call ſuch to be thy ſtates of dignitie, Senatours, Counſellers, Iudges, and Magiſtrates vnder thee, as are graue, wiſe, learned, godlie, zealous of my truth, & gelous of thy renowme.
                        Aduance ſuch men, I ſaie, to honour and office vnder thee, as be of a good conſcience, ſound religion, and

vpright life, ſuch as will be painfull watchmen, and diligent ſtewards, and both can and will make iuſt decrees, and execute good lawes, euen ſuch as will care for nothing more, than to knowe what is their dutie, and that therefore are moſt willing to doo their dutie, hating vnfeinedlie all maner of vice, and louing intirelie all maner of vertue.
                        Come foorth, I ſaie, O deere Daughter; come foorth thou moſt beautifull of all women, and fairer than the children of men: thou, Ô QVEENE, Uirgin, I ſaie of incomparable eloquence and grace of ſpeech; come foorth thus and ſhew thy beautie, ſo full of maieſtie and grace, that in this thy gouernement and paſtorſhip, there may want neither integritie and vprightneſſe in taking of counſell, neither wiſdome in performing of thine interpriſes: but doo all things prudentlie and proſperouſlie, caried vpon the triumphant Chariot, euen the word of God, as a wiſe and vertuous Gouernour directing it: and let truth, mercie, iuſtice, and equitie drawe it round about thy dominion.
                        Thus ſhalt thou declare thy ſelfe a bountifull Daughter of this Prince and woorthie Gouernour, if vſing thy power neither weakelie nor idlelie, thou gouerne my people by moderate equitie, and puniſh mine enimies and thine by ſeueritie of iudgement, as ſhee, before whom alſo ſitting vpon thy throne of Maieſtie, the two pillers, mercie and truth are ſeene to ſtand and ſupport thee.
                     
                     
                        CAP. IIII.
                        
                           AND I, Ô QVEENE, will ſurelie performe my couenant (begun with thy father DAVID that choſen man,) vnto thee alſo his Daughter, whom I will indue alſo with eternitie, and make thy kingdome perpetuall in heauen: and I, as is his will, will continuallie defend thee with a certaine

ſpeciall power, together with the people and land, which I haue choſen and giuen vnto thee.
                        My hand, I ſaie, ſhall eſtabliſh thee, and mine arme ſtrengthen thee: ſo that no enimie ſhall ouercome thee by ſubtiltie, nor anie wicked man oppreſſe thee by force.
                        Yea and though thou ſhalt not want manie, & thoſe moſt mightie enimies, both domeſticall and forreine, which ſhall reſiſt thee, O ſacred QVEENE, and thy godlie proceedings: yet I aſſure thee, all their enterpriſes ſhall be in vaine and fruſtrate, and thou for all thoſe miſeries moſt greeuous; and battell, wherewith thou maiſt ſeeme to be vexed, ſhalt ſuffer no detriment: but contrariwiſe by this ſame meanes, as it is plaine by experience, thou louing righteouſnes, & hating whatſoeuer is againſt it, and being armed with ſharpe arrowes, and the ſword of the word, ſhalt not onlie therwith wound the hearts of thine enimies, caſt them downe to the ground, and tread them vnder thy feete; but alſo bring maruellous things to paſſe in my name, by this thy mightie power.
                        For I the Lord IEHOVA, which am the reuenger of roiall dignitie, and the defender of DAVID my ſeruants poſteritie, will deſtroie all that would oppreſſe thee: before thy face I will ſlaie all thine enimies, and fill them with ſhame and confuſion.
                        My mercie ſhall neuer faile thee, my truth ſhall neuer forſake thee, and thou (truſting to my fauour) ſhalt lift vp thine head moſt high, crowned with euerlaſting glorie.
                        I will cauſe thee to haue one hand vpon the ſea, and another vpon the flouds, and thou ſhalt call mee thy Father, thy God, and thy ſafe tower.
                        And I will place thee as my firſt begotten Daughter, in the ſacred familie of the Kings of the whole world, euen in a throne moſt high aboue others.
                        Yea, thou being a pure Uirgin borne of my kindred,

ſhalt be ſo highlie exalted of IEHOVA, which hath decreed this from all eternitie, that thou ſhalt ſit a glorious QVEENE, ouer a mightie people, and ſhalt haue rule & dominiō ouer all thy ſubiects without exception.
                        Euen I the mightie IEHOVA will giue vnto thee in Zion a kingdome of ſtabilitie ouer all the ends of the earth, in the which kingdome thy power ſhall be ſo great, that the more enimies thou haſt, the more excellent and more euident ſhall thy fame and renowme be to all nations.
                        And the people ſhall willinglie and obedientlie offer themſelues to be gouerned by thee, after the infinite victories which thou ſhalt haue ouer the enimies that vexe thee.
                        And the daie ſhall come, that when thou haſt ouercome all thine enimies, thou ſhalt muſter all thine armies to appeare before thee, and to make a triumph alſo in garments of triumph which ſhall be holie, moſt pure, and moſt ſhining. Then I ſaie Ô QVEENE, thou ſhalt behold the multitude of thy moſt choſen yoong men, and beautifull virgins, which the morning of that moſt heauenlie light ſhall bring foorth vnto thee, by powring downe hir moſt plentifull deaw vpon the earth.
                        Yea, I will arme thee with a double edged ſword in thy hand, wherewith thou maiſt puniſh the prophane Gentiles, and auenge the crueltie of the proud people, and alſo maiſt drawe their kings and nobles bound in chaines and iron fetters, and execute the iudgement appointed and commanded by me thy Lord God vpon them.
                        And this verelie is the dignitie, the honour and renowme that I will giue thee, O daughter; whome I haue receiued into my fauour, euen to bring into ſubiection vnto thy kingdome the people far and wide and (ſauing thine owne nation) to make an horrible

ſlaughter of the rebels and traitors euerie-where, that go about to ouerthrowe the Monarch, which ruleth, and ſhall rule, both far and neere.
                        I will defend thee I ſaie, O my deere Daughter, with euerlaſting mercie, and my couenant made with thy father DAVID ſhall be eſtabliſhed for euer in his generation.
                        Thy throne ſhall be as the Sunne before me, it ſhall continue as the Moone in all ages, and be as ſtable as heauen it ſelfe.
                        For I the holie one haue once ſworne by mine owne ſelfe, and neither will I breake my promiſe, nor violate my couenant, nor will change anie of thoſe things that I haue ſpoken to DAVID thy Father.
                        Theſe things haue I promiſed of old I ſaie, and now will I vndoubtedlie bring them to paſſe. If thou my Daughter keepe my commandements, and do not violate the ordinances that I haue commanded thee, but order thy ſelfe and thy people by the rule of the lawes that I haue preſcribed vnto them.
                        So ſhall all things be in good order, and nothing confounded; yea the verie foundations of the earth alſo ſhall be firme and remaine ſtable. Peace, righteouſneſſe, and iudgement, and all good things elſe ſhall remaine ſafe and ſure amongſt men.
                        Neither will I ſuffer that in this thy dangerous iournie, and perillous pilgrimage, thou ſhouldeſt ſo ſtumble, that thou ſhouldeſt fall, or be compelled to go backe: and though manie doo lie in wait for thy deſtruction, yet I (preuenting all dangers) will bee thy watchfull keeper.
                        For ſeeing that I haue taken in hand freelie, of mine owne good will, to call thee to this excellent eſtate of a Prince, & haue hitherto bene verie carefull to defend thee, and my people Iſrael, I will not now once ſlumber, much leſſe will I be ſo deepe in ſleepe, that I will

ſuffer thee to be oppreſſed.
                        Therefore let this be a thing certainlie determined vnto thee, and bee thou comforted and confirmed with this onlie hope in all diſtreſſe, that I the Lord am thy keeper; and a ſhadowe for thee againſt all ſtormes, and that I am preſent by thee, and will neuer faile thee.
                        And as I was preſent of old, when thou returnedſt out of the Egypt, & bondage of the ſpirituall Pharao: ſo now alſo I will be preſent with thee againſt ye heate of the Sunne in the daie-time; & againſt the noiſome humors, which the Moone vſeth to raiſe in the night ſeaſon.
                        For like as the Citie Ieruſalem is compaſſed round about with maſſie mountaines, ſo I the Lord ſtand round about thee and thy people (truſting in me) on euerie ſide, and will neuer forſake you.
                        But as I haue done hitherto, ſo ſurelie I will continue to defend them that loue vertue, and to bind thee vnto me by new benefits.
                        I will bring to paſſe that thou ſhalt enioie a ſtable peace, and ſure tranquillitie, and that thou ſhalt ſee Ieruſalem flouriſhing ſo long as thou doeſt liue.
                        Yea I the Lord will ſo bleſſe thee from heauen with moſt plentifull bleſſings, that by the power of my Maieſtie, all thy counſelles and enterpriſes ſhall proſper, and haue good ſucceſſe continuallie.
                        I will preſerue thee ſafe againſt all diſcommodities, and defend thy life from violence: yea which waie ſoeuer thou ſhalt go or ride, I, euen I thy mightie maker and God will be with thee, when thou goeſt foorth, and commeſt in, from place to place; and not onlie in this temporall voiage or iournie, but for euer will I gouerne and guide thee.
                        Thou ſhalt neuer be laid open to the reproch of men.
                        Thy Crowne ſhall neuer be caſt to the ground, nor

thy ſelfe reiected.
                        All thy fortreſſes and cities ſhall ſtand vnaſſaulted, and thy forts, and ſtrong caſtels and holds ſhall not be battered, nor laid open with breaches to the ſpoile of paſſengers.
                        The edge of thy ſword ſhall neuer waxe blunt, thy ſcepter neuer broken, nor thy crowne caſt downe into the duſt, nor thy power ſtained.
                        But I will miniſter continuall power, and cauſe of ioie vnto thee, ô QVEENE, and take awaie all courage and force from thine enimies, ſo that they ſhall not be able to ariſe or ſtand againſt thy mightie power.
                        Finallie, this my league, which I haue made with thee, ſhall neuer be abrogated. For I will come downe from my Sanctuarie to helpe thee, euen frō the mount Zion to ſtrengthen thee in all dangers. And when thou calleſt vpon me by praier, I will heare thy petitions, and grant vnto thee that thy hart deſireth, and accompliſh all thy purpoſes, ſo that thou doubtleſſe ſhalt bee preſerued and deliuered a waie by me, that haue annointed thee to be QVEENE.
                        
                     
                     
                        CAP. V.
                        
                           THus, I ſaie my deere Daughter, if thou carefullie behaue thy ſelfe, & walke in the waies that I haue commanded, thou ſhalt be woorthilie honored indeed with that name, wherby mine authoritie ouer all men is declared: and I thy GOD and heauenlie Father will imbrace thee with my ſpeciall fauour, as my deerelie beloued Dooue and obedient child.
                        Yea ſo ſhall the KING haue pleaſure in thy fairenes, and loue thy goodlie perſonage: and it ſhall come to paſſe, that thou ſhalt bee more and more in the high fauour of thy ſpirituall ſpouſe Chriſt my ſonne, to whom

onlie it is meete that thou ſhouldſt be ſubiect, as to thy ſouereigne Lord, King and head, and vnder whoſe gouernement thou ſhalt remaine moſt honourable and admirable, for the ſingular and vnſpeakeable gifts of his grace, to all maner of people, ſtrangers & others: of whom euen the moſt mightie and moſt rich ſhall deſire to ſee thee, and to be linked in friendſhip with thee.
                        For then ſhalt thou come foorth of thy princelie yuorie palace, and ſtatelie roiall throne, moſt gloriouſlie adorned with gorgious garments, and roiall robes that ſmell moſt fragrantlie, and yeeld their ſweete ſauours, and odoriferous odours, moſt pleaſantlie ſpred ouer all thoſe men and people, who to declare their ioie and good-wils towards thee, ſhall run and preſſe togither by thouſands, to ſee, praiſe, and extoll thy renowmed name and Maieſtie, crieng alowd, and ſaieng: GOD ſaue the QVEENE.
                        
                        To conclude, here in my houſe the Church thou ſhalt ſee thy children and offſpring (who by publiſhing and promoting my Goſpell, thou haſt borne after a maner vnto thy huſband Chriſt) flouriſhing, and ſpred both abroad and at home: and nothing inferiour vnto thoſe thy moſt noble Elders, reigning ouer the prouinces of the whole world.
                        But at home chieflie, euen in heauen, with mee thy Father, and with thy huſband Chriſt, thou ſhalt ſit at my right hand, beautified with all my gifts, and moſt richlie beedecked all ouer with glorious garments, broidered with gold, hauing a crowne of moſt pure gold vpon thy head.
                        Euen thus roiallie, I ſaie, ſhalt thou then, O Uirgin, ô QVEENE, O deerlie beloued Daughter, be ſet before the KING thy huſband, with ſuch and ſo pretious apparell, the Uirgins thy companions waiting vpon thee, and going with thee, vnto the moſt glorious

                           KING of kings, whileſt that you (altogither with moſt great triumph, mirth, ioie, & reioicing) ſhall enter into the higheſt manſion of the heauenlie Paradiſe, & moſt holie palace, there to enioie a moſt certaine, vnchangeable, and euerlaſting kingdome, glorie, dignitie, bliſſe and felicitie; and to ſing praiſes vnto the name of the holie Trinitie, together with all Kings, Queenes, Saints, Uirgins, and elect people of the world, that euer were, are, or ſhall bee: worlds without end.

                        Wherein the Queenes Maieſtie, after a moſt Chriſtian maner, euen with Dauids ſpirit, his ſweet words, and diuine ſentences, firſt inciteth & prepareth hir hart and mind to

                        2 
                        and, after a true rehearſall of his manifold benefits beſtowed vpon hir from hir birth, with an acknowledgement of hir ſouereigntie to come onelie from the Lord, ſhe thirdlie confeſſeth hir vnwoorthineſſe, and reioiceth

                        greatlie in his protection and mercie towards hir, ſince hir comming to the Crowne. Fourthlie, hauing his wonderous works and benefits, done for hir preſeruation, in 
                        4 
                        great admiration, ſhee not onelie yeeldeth condigne thanks for the ſame, but exhorteth all creatures, both in heauen and earth, to praiſe God together with hir. And ſo laſtlie ſhe bindeth hir ſelfe as it were by a ſolemne oth, vow and promiſe, to conſecrate hir life wholie to the true 
                        5 
                        worſhip and ſincere ſeruice of God, in all holie obedience to his lawes, to the glorie of God, and full diſcharge of hir dutie, both in hir Court and Realme.

                        Therefore, O my God, I being now prepared with my whole hart; with my whole hart and mind, I ſaie, haue great deſire to ſpeake vnto thee: and in this my preſent moſt happie eſtate, to call into my remembrance thy woonderfull works, wrought and brought to paſſe by thine almightie power for me, from my conception, euen vntill this houre.
                        Neither will I doo it, O Lord, with my mouth onlie, as hypocrites vſe to doo; but I will vnfeinedlie teſtifie thee my God to be mine onlie maker, redeemer, preſeruer, and Sauiour, with praiſe that ſhall proceed euen from the deepe bottome of my hart.
                        Go to then my tongue, go to my mouth, I ſaie; bee thou no longer dumbe; but open thy ſelfe wide, to ſpeake out the moſt excellent praiſes of my God, and make thy hartie Uowes, and ſaie: as followeth.

                           I humblie acknowledge thee to be the verie God of Angels, and of men; the moſt ſacred Emperour of the moſt mightie ſpirits, and holie companie of the heauenlie armies, which celebrate thy truth and praiſe perpetuallie, in the regions aboue vs; yea, the greateſt God, higheſt Lord, and moſt magnificall King, far aboue all Emperours, Kings, Lords and Princes, how great ſoeuer.
                           Euen the God of Abraham, Iſaac and Iacob, and of my father Dauid, and his poſteritie, Kings and Queenes my predeceſſors; which art higher than the heauens, and the mightie Monarch of the whole world; hauing of nothing made heauen and earth, and all things therein by thine almightie power; guiding, preſeruing, and ruling by the ſame the ſtate of kingdoms, and all the creatures and people that dwell in the world: reſeruing in thy power and authoritie, as the Lord of all, both the lowe ſecret parts of the earth, the deepe bottoms of the Sea, and the high tops of the mountaines: reigning euer full of Maieſtie, power, and authoritie, and that moſt gloriouſlie and triumphantlie, in an eternall and euerlaſting kingdome.
                           For whereas all other kingdoms trulie are tranſitorie, and ſubiect to deſtruction; thy kingdome onlie O God, I confeſſe, is not limited in anie bounds, nor

ſubiect to anie tearme of yeares or time; but alwaies endureth one, and vnchangeable, from all eternitie to eternitie; as he whoſe throne is for euer and euer: and which haſt raiſed a kingdome for thy ſelfe, among thine Angels and people, both in heauen and in earth of old, to continue alwaie moſt ſtable, firme, and vnmoueable.
                           So that thou, Lord, onlie maiſt iuſtlie challenge vnto thy ſelfe, the authoritie of the kingdome in deede, ouer all nations vpon the earth: who art that moſt gelous and dreadfull IEHOVA, vnto whome all the Emperours, Kings, and Gouernours in the world ſhall bow, ſubmit themſelues, and doo their homage and diuine ſeruice, with their ſcepters and crownes caſt vnder thy feete: and who dooeſt declare thy ſelfe verie terrible to all the potentates and powers of the world, and cutteſt off their courage, ſtrength, and glorie, throwing it in the duſt, euen as the Gardener doth twiſt and proine his Uine.

                              AND therefore, moſt worthilie aſcribing and reſigning vp the honour and glorie of all empire, kingdome, rule, power and dominion vnto the holie, ſecret, maruellous, and renoumed name of thy moſt high and ſacred Maieſtie, which art the father of lights, ancient of daies, the ſauiour of all beleeuers, and the onlie redeemer, ſtrength, glorie and hope of Iſrael, and of all the ends of the earth, euen Alpha and Omega, the firſt without beginning, and the laſt without ending, that ſhalt come to iudge both the quicke & the dead, God bleſſed for euer, Amen.
                           
                           I (according as it is meete, and my verie bounden dutie) doo now meekelie confeſſe, and proteſt to thy perpetuall praiſe, that it is thou, O moſt mercifull God, and none other, which in the beginning, when I laie

as a rude lumpe without ſhape, being ſhut vp in the ſecret place of my mothers wombe, didſt forme, faſhion, and nouriſh me; and at the time appointed, and ſet downe in thy booke, didſt drawe me foorth of the darke caue, wherein I was faſhioned, and broughtſt me foorth of the bowels of my mother, as it were a midwife.
                           So that the verie bowels within me, are thine owne, by good right and authoritie; becauſe thou ioining all my ſinewes and bones togither, haſt made me a mortall woman, and couered me within my mothers wombe. For there is no King or Queene that had anie other beginning of birth: for all men haue one entrance into life, and one going out in like manner.
                           Which worke of thine ſurelie, when I behold in my ſelfe, it is ſo wonderfull, O Lord, that I ſhould vtterlie ſhew my ſelfe moſt ſenſeleſſe and vnthankefull, vnleſſe I praiſe thee for the ſame, and confeſſe, that thy works are exceeding maruellous in deede, ſeeing I doo perceiue the thing ſo manifeſtlie as it is.
                           So ſoone alſo as I, thy workemanſhip, came, foorth a reaſonable creature into this world, I receiued like aire as other men, and was committed vnto thee my Creator, at what time thou didſt declare thy ſelfe to be my God, and cauſedſt me to looke vp vnto thee, when I did hang yet on my mothers breaſts.
                           Euen in my verie cradle and ſwadling clouts, O God, thou hadſt a ſpeciall care & regard ouer me, and tookeſt in hand fatherlie to foſter and gouerne me ſo manie yeares ago, and to leade and guide me from my tender yeares vnto this daie.
                           Euer ſince I was borne, I ſaie, thou my God haſt defended me from dangers, both when I was ſtrong, and in the floure of my youth: neither haſt thou forſaken me now, being in my middle age, nor wilt (I truſt) when I am graie-headed.
                           
                              
O mine inlightener, it is thou that haſt taught and inſtructed me with the knowledge of thee, from my childhood hitherto. Therefore haue I depended wholie vpon thee alone; vpon thee, I ſaie, O excellent Father, haue I ſet all my hope, euen from mine infancie, and will doo ſo ſtill euen vnto mine old age.
                        
                        
                           CAP. III.
                           
                              NEither hath thy prouidence and mercie towards me, ceaſed at anie tune. For ſurelie, thou haſt made me a ſingular & euerlaſting example of thy fauour & mercie to all men, in that thou beholding me alwaies with thy pleaſant countenance, and obſeruing continuallie with thine heauenlie eie, what iniurie ſoeuer was offered me, haſt not onelie woonderfullie comforted and preſerued me in all my troubles: but alſo oftentimes moſt miraculouſlie ſaued and deliuered mee out of moſt great and manifold miſeries, imminent perils, and multitudes of mightie enimies, wherewith I haue beene aſſaulted, enuironed, vexed, afflicted, perſecuted, and turmoiled from my tender age.
                           Yea ſo tenderlie, O God, haſt thou loued mee, that thou haſt not ſuffered me to be intrapped of thouſands of aduerſaries, that roſe vp againſt me, ſaieng in their harts, Hir God can not helpe hir. But being the iudge of mine innocencie, my glorie, my ſhield, and my valiant Champion, thou haſt thy ſelfe ſmitten downe all mine enimies, brought me ſafelie out of diſtreſſe, and lift vp my head aboue all mine aduerſaries.
                           Thou haſt deliuered my life, I ſaie, foorth of the preſent doores of death, ſtaied the teares of mine eies, and eſtabliſhed my feete, that I did not fall for any temptation: ſo that I walked ſafe & ſound before thee, among the liuing that praiſed thee. And that I liue now to praiſe thee, I may onlie thanke thee my deliuerer, who

haſt cauſed me thus to taſte, feele, and enioie the moſt comfortable ſweetneſſe of thy goodneſſe, mercie, and fauour.
                           And though I was forſaken of all men; and the moſt mightie, together with my neereſt friends, had mee in contempt: though the ſuperſtitious aduerſaries, I ſaie, heaued vehementlie againſt me, and with great violence ſought to caſt me downe, and laie mine honor in the duſt: yet haſt thou, my God, by thine owne hand repulſed & driuen out all thoſe mine irreligious foes, which ſo wickedlie reſiſted thy purpoſe; and to their confuſion of faces, haſt exalted me to the higheſt degree of dignitie.
                           Wherefore, great cauſe of continuall ioie and hartie reioicing haſt thou, O Lord, giuen vnto me, thine handmaid, which acknowledge my ſelfe mightilie and miraculouſlie preſerued by thy power.
                           Doubtleſſe, now thou haſt woonderfullie deliuered in deed thy QVEENE, that was annointed by thee, and haſt heard me out of the higheſt Sanctuarie, & granted vnto me that, which I requeſted in my praiers.
                           For I put my truſt, neither in chariot, nor horſes, men nor munition: but onelie remembred thy name, and called vpon thee in all my troubles: and lo, thou, ô KING of heauen, haſt heard me in all my neceſſities, and giuen me my harts deſire, accompliſhing all my purpoſes.
                           I required this thing onlie of thee, that I might eſcape aliue and ſafe from perſecution; but thou haſt not onelie ſtrengthened and comforted me out of Zion, and placed me here in thy dominion and empire in ſafetie: but alſo haſt granted vnto me a life that ſhall neuer faile; and that bicauſe I onelie ſet my hope ſtill in thee, in whom all power remaineth, as I oftentimes by good experience haue prooued.
                           Yea thou, O moſt excellent Father, haſt done a notable

worke, woorthie to bee ſet foorth in writing to all poſteritie, and to be limmed out in gold to euerlaſting memorie; bicauſe, O Lord, thou haſt not deſpiſed the praiers and teares of thy moſt miſerable people; but from thy holie throne haſt looked downe vpon me, and them, to heare the mournings of the priſoners, thy perſecuted members; and to looſe them foorth of bonds and fetters, of whoſe life it was vtterlie deſpaired: that in Zion once againe thy name, O Lord; and thy praiſes, I ſaie, in Ieruſalem might be publiſhed by my miniſterie, as it is this daie, manie nations and people running together to worſhip thee, who haſt now ſhewed thy ſelfe much more glorious therein, than at anie time before.
                           Therefore, O God, which art indeed the Gouernor and Lord ouer all people, in heauen and in earth: thou art our God by a peculiar right, and mine onlie honor. For ſo great glorie haue I attained, by this thy defence and ſaluation; and ſo bright is the glittering of this honour, wherewith thou haſt crowned me; that I may woorthilie triumph in thee, being thus preſerued and deliuered by thee: and alſo condignelie celebrate this daie wholie to thee, with banners diſplaied, which haſt ſo gratiouſlie granted all the petitions of thine handmaid.
                           Namelie, for that thou, Lord, being euer mindfull of thy promiſe and word, which is of force for euer, and prouiding for thine owne onlie glorie, didſt ſo mercifullie and miraculouſlie preſerue me from dangers; and rebuking euen Kings and Princes for my ſake, ſo pretious and deere was my bloud in thy ſight, that none ſhould touch thine Annointed, nor doo me anie harme, at the time appointed by thee; thou allowing, iuſtifieng, and commending me as innocent, whom others did maliciouſlie condemne as guiltie of wickedneſſe, didſt moſt faithfullie and freelie performe thy promiſes

towards me, and changing my miſerable eſtate into bliſſe, didſt bring me foorth glad and ioifull, whom thou hadſt appointed thine elect handmaid, and choſen ſeruant, to gouerne thy people and affaires in this kingdome.
                        
                        
                           CAP. IIII.
                           
                              WHerefore, I humblie acknowledge that it is thou, O almightie GOD; which raiſeſt vp the abiects, and exalteſt the miſerable from the dunghill, to place them among the Princes of the people: and which ſomtime laiedſt helpe vpon one that was mightie, and didſt exalt one choſen of the people (my father DAVID thy ſeruant I meane,) whom thou tookeſt from the ſheepfold, and with thy holie oile didſt annoint, and broughteſt to feed thy people and inheritance in Iſrael.
                           Euen thou, O God, I ſaie, the ſelfe-ſame good God it is, I confeſſe, which haſt alſo conſecrated ELIZABETH to thy ſelfe, to gouerne thy people, ouer whome thou dooeſt chieflie rule: and who haſt vouchſafed in like fauour, and in as great mercie, to call me out of the priſon to the palace, and to appoint me to be the Prince and Paſtor to feede the poſteritie of Iacob, and moſt deere people of Iſrael, with the ſpirituall food of thine eternall word.
                           My preferment, Lord, and promotion I knowe, is come neither from the eaſt, nor from the weſt; from the ſouth, nor from the north; neither, as I haue well perceiued, was it in mine owne power to exalt my ſelfe, and to mount vp out of ſo great miſerie to ſo high dignitie.
                           But it was thou my KING, and my God, euen thou moſt iuſt Gouernour of all things, (which bringeſt to paſſe mightie things, farre paſſing the condition of mankind, and ruleſt the ſtate of kingdoms, to whom

alone it belongeth, and in whoſe power and authoritie it is, to caſt downe whom thou wilt, and to exalt whom it pleaſeth thee) which haſt exalted mee thine handmaid, and giuen vnto me thine abſolute authoritie, ouer all the great Princes and people of England; that I ſhould gouerne the verie Magiſtrates & Commons thereof, by the direction of thy word, wiſdome, and counſell.
                           Yea, I take thee to record, O Lord, againſt the ſlanders of all men, that I neuer deſired this honour, as though I had deſerued it; neither laboured that I ſhould be brought vnto this dignitie; nor that I am now proud, being promoted by thee thervnto; nor that I doo ſo much as thinke or reioice that I am brought to this Kinglie office by bloud, birth, or by mine owne endeuour or power.
                           But alwaies I haue, and ſtill will confeſſe, and humblie acknowledge to thy glorie, that it was thou onlie, O Lord, my Redeemer and Sauiour, vpon whome I did earneſtlie call and ſet mine eies, which (at what time it pleaſed thee to heare me) didſt vouchſafe to embrace me with thy ſpeciall grace and fauour, and to beſtowe this ſo great a benefit vpon me. Firſt, to chooſe and take me onelie out of the reſt of the people, and to exalt me aboue others; and then to conſecrate mee to thy ſelfe, and to annoint me with thy holie oile to be the QVEENE of this Realme, and that not for anie deſert of mine at all, I ſaie; but onlie bicauſe it ſo pleaſed thee to vſe my ſeruice and endeuour, in this ſo weightie buſineſſe, to defend thy people by my power receiued from thee.
                           Finallie, it was thou, O heauenlie KING, who fauouring me thine handmaid more than I deſerued, didſt richlie apparell mee in the roiall robes, and all ouer cloathedſt and beedeckedſt me with ſtatelie garments, brodered with gold and pretious ſtones; and

as vpon this daie, ſettedſt me in the regall throne, and cauſedſt me moſt gloriouſlie to come foorth from the yuorie Palace of my Coronation, accompanied with manie noble Princes, & goodlie Uirgins, and bearing the diademe or Crowne of pure gold vpon mine head. At what time alſo thou madeſt the moſt fragrant odours of my ſweet garments ſo ſpread it ſelfe, that nothing was more pleaſant vnto the beholders; who as then vpon that happie daie, ſo continuallie euer ſince doo runne together, and preſſe in great multitudes vnto me, to ſee me; and to declare their thankefull harts to thee for me, and their good willes they beare toward me in thee; euermore they crie with lowd voices, and ioifull harts; vttering foorth to the praiſe of thy name, and my great comfort, theſe and ſuch like hartie praiers vnto thy Maieſtie for mee, ſaieng: God ſaue the QVEENE: God ſaue the Queene ELIZABETH.
                           
                           So that I may now iuſtlie ſaie, O moſt excellent father, that this is the daie in deede, wherein thou haſt chieflie ſhewed thy mercie vnto me, and that this daie thou didſt as it were beget me a deere Daughter vnto thy ſelfe; in that as vpon this daie thou didſt ſo gratiouſlie annoint me thy Miniſter and Queene, to deliuer thine afflicted Church, & to reigne vpon thy holie mount Zion, there to declare to all nations the woonderfull works that thou haſt done for me, and thy people Iſrael; as I doo at this preſent. Go to therefore, O my ſoule, returne now to thy reſt, and take thine eaſe; ſeeing that ſo notable a change of thine eſtate is happilie wrought by the Lord, for he hath well deſerued thereby euerlaſting praiſe for his mercie.

                           CAP. I.
                           
                              BUT, O Lord my God, who am I thy ſinfull ſeruant, that thou haſt been thus mindfull of me? And what haue I deſerued (who of all others haue leaſt deſerued, and am thy moſt vnworthie handmaid,) that thou ſhouldeſt thus regard me, and exalt me to ſo high dignitie before manie others?
                           Thou haſt annointed me with the oile of gladneſſe before my fellowes, and ſet a moſt pretious diademe vpon my head. Thou makeſt me to ſit in the higheſt place of dignitie and eſtate, far aboue other men that are my ſubiects. Yea thou, O God, which art Lord of the whole earth, haſt brought into ſubiection the people that lie neere vnto me, ouer whome I haue authoritie; and haſt honoured me in deede with that heauenlie name, whereby thine authoritie ouer all men is declared.
                           Thou haſt crowned me, I ſaie, with great glorie and honour, cauſing my renowme and fame to ſpread far and neere; yea thou haſt made me nothing inferiour to other Potentates of the world; but ordeined mee Lord ouer the works of thine hands in ſouereigne wiſe, ſo that thou cauſeſt all to ſerue me dutifullie.
                           Thou, my King & my God, haſt powred foorth vpon me (I confeſſe) all thy bountie and graces, that none is able to be compared vnto mee.
                           Thou haſt cauſed both Kings and Queenes to come from far, and to bring preſents and rich gifts vnto me: and thou haſt made me honourable, euen to ſtrange people, of whome euen the moſt mightie and rich honouring me, haue and doo deſire greatlie my friendſhip and fauour.
                           Thou haſt preuented me with thy bleſſings, and

without anie aſking, giuen me the people for an inheritance, and the ends of the earth for my poſſeſſion.
                           Surelie a moſt pleaſant place, and a moſt beautifull portion of inheritance is fallen vnto me from thee, O Lord, which art my portion, my reward, and alone to me all-ſufficient.
                           Thou art he that haſt giuen me this moſt large and excellent heritage, and planted me in a moſt fat and wealthie place; by whoſe power I may worthilie glorie of my dignitie and honour, and that by thy ſingular benefit; and for none other cauſe, but onlie that it hath pleaſed thee to receiue me into thy ſpeciall fauour.
                           For ſurelie, there is no cauſe why I ſhould aſcribe the atteining of this kingdome to mine owne worthineſſe (although I called oft vpon thy name) or that I ſhould imagine that I haue reſiſted ſo manie, and ſo mightie people, by mine owne power and ſtrength; neither by the truſting in mine owne bowe or ſword haue I obteined ſo manie victories, and driuen awaie mine enimies: but thou thy ſelfe, O Lord, haſt done it by the ſtrength of thine owne arme, and that onlie becauſe it ſo pleaſed thee, I ſaie, of thine owne meere mercie and goodneſſe to preſerue and deliuer both me and my people.
                        
                        
                           CAP. II.
                           
                              NEither hath thy mercie ceaſſed heere, O God: for it hath not failed euer ſince my comming to the Crowne, to gouerne me afterward by thy wiſdome and grace; and miraculouſlie to preſerue and defend me by thy princelie power, from all mine enimies, viſible and inuiſible, domeſticall and foraigne.
                           Hitherto haſt thou bene vnto me a moſt ſafe refuge, & a moſt ſure tower againſt all the powers of Satan.
                           Oh how great and maruellous things do I ſee, that thou, O God, haſt brought to paſſe for me thine vnworthy

ſeruant, by thy mightie power!
                           For when there wanted not ſuch, who rebelled againſt me, and reſiſted thy power and ordinance: yet I doo ſee my ſelfe ſufficientlie armed by thee continuallie with ſharpe arrowes, wherewith to wound the verie harts of mine enimies, and ſo to caſt them downe.
                           Moreouer, how long and how often haue the ſonnes of men laboured greatlie to diſtaine mine honour, reioicing and perſiſting in vanitie and ſuperſtition? And what ſecret and wicked counſell they haue taken to bring vngodlie things to effect againſt me; thou, O Lord, well knoweſt, and I haue prooued.
                           For I am ſhe, againſt whom the ſuperſtitious enimies haue intended all theſe euils. I am ſhe, againſt whom they haue inuented, and dailie doo inuent that wickedneſſe, which they ſhall neuer be able to bring to paſſe.
                           For thou, Lord, haſt had mercie vpon me, and made fruſtrate the deuiſes and deſires of all my craftie and cruell enimies, and eſtabliſhed me in my throne, that according to the office and authoritie thou haſt giuen me, I might iuſtlie puniſh their infidelitie.
                           Thou haſt ſcattered the people that delight in war, and cauſed the runnagates to turne their backs vnto me, by directing their owne ſwords to light vpon their owne necks, and their owne darts againſt their faces.
                           For in thy wrath, Lord, thou haſt caſt the vngodlie into the flaming fire; and vtterlie deſtroied and conſumed them and their poſteritie, by the heate of thy furie, that proudlie roſe vp againſt thee, and thine Annointed.
                           Yea, thou haſt cauſed me to be reuenged on the heathen, to breake mine enimies aſunder with an iron rod, and to cruſh them in peeces like potſhards on the earth. Mine hand, I ſaie, hath taken mine enimies, O God, through thy power; and thou wilt bring to paſſe,

that my right hand ſhall apprehend them that hate me without cauſe.
                           For vndoubtedlie now I knowe, that thou dooſt not hate me; but loue me tenderlie, euen by this; that thou haſt not ſuffered mine enimies to triumph ouer me, as they verelie hoped: but haſt made me ſtand faſt and ſure, through thy defence, whereby I knowe thou wilt alwaies care for me.
                           O God my God, what ſhall I ſaie? Uerelie I doo greatlie reioice, that thou haſt, with ſo great fauour, embraced me; euer preuenting my praiers, and giuing helpe vnto hir that called vpon thee, with a mind free from all euill imaginations. For elſe thou wouldeſt not haue heard me, nor reſtored my life, when it was as good as loſt, as thou haſt done.
                           But I, calling hartilie vpon thy name, chieflie in mine aduerſities, thou haſt deliuered me out of all my troubles, frights, and feares, and defended me, and waſt my refuge in extreme dangers; and by thy mercie haſt brought to paſſe, that not onelie I dailie behold my traitrous enimies to haue their condigne puniſhments: but alſo this people, whom thou haſt appointed to be gouerned by me, to conſider this thy iudgement extended vpon thoſe guiltie rebels, ſuperſtitious aduerſaries, and prophane men, that ſo wilfullie reſiſt thine ordinance and authoritie in me: and to be ſufficientlie taught by their example and deſtruction, to remember the feare, dread, and reuerence due vnto thee their God, and their Prince.
                        
                        
                           CAP. III.
                           
                              MOreouer, O Lord, I do greatly reioice, when I bethinke me what a tower of ſtrength, a ſafe hauen, & vnaſſaultable habitation thou haſt euer beene, not onlie vnto me: but alſo vnto my predeceſſours & forefathers, Kings and Princes

of this land, ſucceeding one another in order. And how thou haſt beene the honour, and alſo the ſtrength both of them and me: and haſt from time to time, with a certaine ſpeciall power, defended this little Iſland, which thou haſt choſen to be thy peculiar heritage, & giuen it firſt vnto them, and now vnto me in poſſeſſion.
                           Yea, what alterations or changes of things or times ſoeuer haue fallen; yet haſt thou, O moſt mightie Gouernour (whoſe kingdome for euer hath beene, is, and alwaie ſhall be moſt ſure, ſtable, permanent, vnchangable, and vnmooueable) lift vp the head of thine handmaid, as it were of an Unicorne, being annointed by thee with freſh oile, and laden with new benefits continuallie.
                           Thou art he, I ſaie, by whoſe power conſiſteth whatſoeuer is high in the world: euen by thy might, which as it eſtabliſheth the kingdoms and policies, whereby mankind is preſerued: ſo alſo by theſe teſtimonies of thy moſt mightie power, the inhabitants of the earth being conuinced, doo tremble and keepe ſilence. And this peace being reſtored in my dominion, thou cauſeſt that my people againe doo leade their liues both daie and night in comfortable peace, & godlie tranquillitie.
                           Wherefore thou haſt giuen me great cauſe of new ioie, and to reioice in thee, O Lord my God, who haſt thus mercifullie dealt with me thine handmaid; and eſpeciallie, bicauſe thou haſt granted vnto me to ouercome all mine enimies, how manie, and how mightie ſoeuer; and to compoſe and ſet my kingdome in peaceable order; and to place in Iuda the throne of iudgement and iuſtice, being directed by thy word, O GOD, which I haue, and whereof I glorie, & ſtill will glorie.
                           To conclude, I doo reioice; bicauſe thou, Lord, art my louing ſhepheard, and feedeſt me in the greene paſtures and ſweet medowes of thy word with ioie and ſolace; making me, that was ſometime as a barren

woman, without comfort, now a ioifull and glad foſter mother of manie ſpirituall children to thee.
                           Yea, euen in the verie ſight of mine enimies dooeſt thou, O moſt bountifull Father, prepare a deintie table for me, and reaching vnto me a full cup, thou giueſt me drinke of thy pleaſant ſprings; and cauſeſt thy goodneſſe and mercie, thy bountie and liberalitie to followe me, whereſoeuer I become: bleſſing both me and my people with all thy bleſſings continuallie.
                           Finallie, it is thou, O Lord, onlie; who of thy ſingular goodneſſe haſt aſſuredlie fortified my hill woonderfullie with honour, health, peace, and ſecuritie: and that dooeſt preſentlie keepe me in ſafetie, and cauſeſt me quietlie to lie downe and take my reſt in thee.
                           Thou dooſt ward the gates of my Cities with bars, and mightilie multiplie and cheriſh thy familie my citizens. Thou bringeſt me into amitie with my neighbors, and feedeſt me with the fineſt flower of wheate.
                           And theſe things verelie doo teſtifie moſt plainlie, both thine infinite goodneſſe and power; yet ſurelie they are nothing, in compariſon of that benefit of the doctrine of ſaluation and holie word, which thou haſt beſtowed vpon thy people; and deliuered vnto vs, as a rule to lead our liues both godlie and honeſtlie: neither is there anie nation vnder heauen, with whom thou haſt ſo dealt, as with vs herein. Therfore, hauing ſuch experience of thy ſupport, I will comfort my ſelfe in thee, my ſtrength & my ſhield, in whom my hart doth reſt; neither will thine Annointed truſt in anie other: but onelie in thee, which giueſt power vnto Princes.
                           Euen I will bleſſe and praiſe thee, O Lord, which thus haſt bleſſed both me and my people with thy continuall bleſſings. And in this my preſent bleſſed ſtate, I will not ceaſe to magnifie thee, O Lord, my deliuerer; but I will declare & ſet foorth before all people the maruellous works, which thou, my God, haſt done for

me; and whereof I my ſelfe, from the beginning of my life, vnto this houre, haue had good proofe & experience.

                              OH Lord my God, how excellent is thy name ouer all the earth! Aduancing mee thus to glorie, far aboue my deſerts, I as one nothing able to compaſſe ſuch great mercies, am euen aſtoniſhed with the admiration of thine excellent liberalitie, and fatherlie prouidence ouer me.
                           O how greatlie doo theſe ſo manie, and ſo great benefits binde me vnto thee! And what ſhall I giue againe vnto thee for all thy bountie, which thou haſt beſtowed vpon me? Uerelie I will paie that which onlie I am able; namelie, I will take in my hands the Lampe which thou haſt ordeined for thine annointed, and will therein continuallie magnifie thy mercie.
                           I will take in my hands (I ſaie) the cup of thankefull ſacrifice; and calling vpon thee by name, O Lord, I will teſtifie openlie, that I knowledge this my deliuerance and honour to be onelie of thee.
                           And thoſe things which I vowed vnto thee, O Lord, when I was in danger, will I now paie in the preſence of all the people. For thou art he, by whoſe benefit I remaine aliue: thou art my defence, my tower, my ſauiour, my ſheeld, my refuge; finallie, thou art he, who onelie haſt ſubdued all this people vnto me, and therefore well deſerueſt the renowme and praiſe of all theſe victories, by moſt worthie right.
                           Wherefore, by good right, O Lord, I will declare thy praiſes, euen with a ſounding voice. And bicauſe it becommeth all men and women, that haue receiued benefits of thee, and to whome thou granteſt the vſe of this life, and deliuered from ſo manie, not dangers, but deaths, to doo this thing diligentlie and continuallie; I will labour to commit the memoriall of thy benefits

vnto others, and exhort them to accompanie me in the dutie of thankefulneſſe earneſtlie, and ſaie:
                        
                        
                           CAP. II.
                           
                              O All yee holie ſpirits, the apparitors of the Lords Maieſtie, which are diuided into innumerable garriſons, go yee before others in this his praiſe, and ſound them foorth, euen from the moſt high heauen.
                           O yee Citizens of Zion, reioice yee in the Lord your King and Gouernour, and ſet foorth his praiſe far and wide, not onlie priuatelie, but alſo publikelie.
                           Praiſe the Lord, I ſaie; for his infinite goodneſſe and euerlaſting mercie deſerueth the ſame.
                           O you the innumerable multitude, whome God hath deliuered out of manifold dangers, and foorth of the hands of your enimies and perſecutors, praiſe the Lord; for his infinite goodneſſe and euerlaſting mercie deſerueth the ſame, and acknowledge this thing with me.
                           For how manie hath he gathered from the beginning of the world, which were ſcattered from the Eaſt and the Weſt, from the North and South Ocean ſea?
                           How manie wandering wretches in the waſte wilderneſſe, and ſeeking a Citie commodious to dwell in, halfe dead, and killed with famine and thirſt; crieng vnto thee, O God, in their extreame miſeries, haſt thou heard; and drawing them foorth of their diſtreſſe, haſt brought into the right waie, and led them into commodious Cities of refuge to dwell in peace?
                           O let theſe men therefore ſet foorth this thy great mercie before thee, O Lord thy ſelfe, and ſhew foorth thy maruellous works to other men; who haſt thus refreſhed them panting for thirſt; and fed them ſo mercifullie, being hunger-ſtarued!
                           How manie alſo being ſhut vp in darke priſons, and

euen as it were in the darkeneſſe of death, being chained in their mind with ſorow, and in their bodies moſt ſtrictlie with iron fetters? And that worthilie (I confeſſe,) becauſe they did not obeie thy commandements oh God, which are engrauen in the minds of all men, but rather followed their owne luſts, than the wholeſome counſelles of thee their God.
                           Notwithſtanding, when thou, O God, thereby well hadſt tamed their fierceneſſe, and hadſt brought them to this point, that they could find no help in anie; thou gratiouſlie heardſt them crieng vnto thee in their diſtreſſe, and deliueredſt them from their miſerie, and broughtſt them from the dongeons of the priſons, and darkeneſſe of death, breaking their iron fetters in ſunder.
                           O praiſe yee therefore this ſo great mercie of the Lord before him, and declare his woonderfull actes to other mortall men, who hath broken the braſen gates, and hath daſhed in peeces their iron barres.
                           How manie alſo being driuen awaie through perſecution, vnto that prophane Babylon, euen auoiding ſo much as laie in you, the ſight of the wicked enimies, did confeſſe with moſt dolefull ſilence, euen with abundance of teares, both your ſinnes and ſorowes, at the flouds of Euphrates, being mindfull of Zion.
                           And though you caried your harps euen to be your comfort in ſo great calamitie, yet being outragiouſlie mocked and derided in your miſerie, by the enimie that draue you awaie into moſt miſerable captiuitie, you were faine to hang them vp vpon the ſallowe trees, and make no noiſe in the ſight of the perſecutors; as they that ſawe more cauſe rather to mourne than ſing in that time and place.
                           Notwithſtanding, the Lord did not forget you for euer, but ſeeing the crueltie of the perſecutors, in his good time turned awaie your captiuitie & mourning,

and reſtored you to libertie and ioie againe, ſo that you liue and ſee the daie, wherein Babylon is deſtroied, and hir children daſhed againſt the ſtones. For the Lord hath giuen hir proſperitie vnto vs, to deale with them againe, as they haue dealt with vs.
                           Yea, the Lord hath armed his people with double edged ſwords in their hands, wherewith they may puniſh the prophane Gentiles, and auenge the crueltie of the oppreſſed; & alſo may drawe their kings and nobles bound in chaines and iron fetters, euen to execute the iudgements appointed and commanded by thee O Lord. And this verelie is the dignitie and the honour of all them, whome God hath receiued to his fauour.
                           Wherefore, O ye glorious people, vpon whome the Lord hath beſtowed ſo manie benefits, now ſee that yee in this your great quietneſſe and reſt, ſing & triumph.
                           Praiſe the Lord in deede, O Iſrael, and delight thy ſelfe in ſetting foorth his praiſe continuallie, whoſe worke thou art as it were newlie formed, being deliuered from ſo manie not dangers but deaths.
                           What ſhall I ſpeake, Lord, furthermore of them, who by their owne fooliſhneſſe, going in the waie of wickedneſſe, and being oppreſſed by manifold plagues and diſeaſes, doo dailie ſuffer the reward of their madneſſe; and loathing all manner of meate, are at deaths dore; whom notwithſtanding thou, O Lord, diddeſt heare crieng vnto thee in their miſerie, and thou deliueredſt them out of their diſtreſſe; yea thou ſpeaking but one word, diddeſt take awaie all the cauſe of their deadlie diſeaſe, and reſtoredſt them to health.
                           Let theſe men alſo, I ſaie, praiſe this thy ſo great mercies, O Lord, and publiſh thy maruellous works before other mortall men. Let them offer the ſacrifices of praiſe vnto thee, O God, in the middle multitude of the people ſtanding about them; and let them rehearſe

with great ioie, what he hath done for them, in the aſſemblie of the cheefeſt.
                           Go to therefore, O all yee people; praiſe the Lord our God together with me; who when wee were oppreſſed with Pharaos tyrannie, was mindfull of vs; and with a ſtrong force deliuered Iſrael from the ſlauerie of Egypt, and hath giuen this dominion to be poſſeſſed by ELIZABETH his handmaid; for his mercie endureth for euer.
                        
                        
                           CAP. III.
                           
                              O All yee people, I ſaie, tribes, kindreds, and inhabitants of the earth; both noble and ſimple, rich and poore; clap your hands, and praiſe this moſt holie God with moſt ioifull voices.
                           Giue vnto the Lord the praiſe of all power, worſhip, and glorie: giue him the honour due vnto his name and maieſtie. For lo, he is come to gouerne the earth. The Lord himſelfe reigneth amongſt you, and gouerneth the whole world with a iuſt and righteous gouernement, and ruleth altogether with the ſcepter of his iuſtice and truth.
                           Go to therefore O yee yong ſtriplings, and old men, yong children, maidens & matrones, and you alſo all other that loue & feare God, come (I praie you) & praiſe ye name of ye Lord, euen of our moſt mightie IEHOVA, together with mee. For he alone deſerueth moſt high praiſe, as he that is more deepe than the verie earth, and more high than the heauens, and far aboue all the powers and potentates of the world.
                           Go to alſo O ye damſels and virgins, ſtir vp your ioie to daie with ſongs of praiſe vpon timbrell & lute, but voide of wantonneſſe: ſo that your ioie may tend to the glorie of God, your onlie ſtrength; and celebrate this daie of your deliuerance, as feſtiuail to the Lord

our deliuerer.
                           O ye Uirgins and damſels vnmaried now reioice with me, I ſaie; and ſing vnto the Lord a triumphant ſong. Praiſe the Lord alſo, O ye brides in your marriage ſongs with glorie and maieſtie, that ye liue to ſee my daies, and that the flower of your youth is not conſumed in the flame of Gods furie.
                           For the time was, when you being deſolate and vnmarried, did remaine penſife without your marriage ſongs, and liued ſolitarie, ſitting at home among the ſoote of pots: but now, the women that durſt not come out of their houſes, come foorth glittering like gold, and ſhining like dooues as white as ſnowe, and boldlie diuide the ſpoile of the enimie.
                           Go to therefore, O ye damſels of Iuda, and multitude of Uirgins; ſeeing ye haue ſo great cauſe to reioice; ſhew not your ſelues vnthankfull in anie wiſe: but praiſe the Lord together with me in Hymnes, and celebrate his name with ſpirituall ſongs, for his victories, goodneſſe, and mercie towards vs.
                           Come foorth yee daughters of Zion, I ſaie; and breake out into gladneſſe with me, reioice you of the iuſt iudgements of God vpon our enimies: yea, compaſſe you Zion round about, account hir towers, conſider diligentlie hir wals and bulworks, and ſet foorth the praiſes of hir peace and palaces; ſo that yee may ſpread foorth the memorie thereof, euen to all poſteritie. And doo you let all men to vnderſtand, that this is God, euen our owne God for euer, which hath not forſaken vs, neither will leaue vs, no not in the laſt minute of our life.
                           Go to now therefore I beſeech you, let vs altogether praiſe the Lord, as we are bounden; let the whole companie of vs Uirgins plaie vpon the Timbrels on euerie ſide, and corner of the citie Zion, one exhorting and anſwering another by courſe, and that with new

and excellent ſongs of praiſe to the glorie of God.
                           Let vs magnitie that mightie and eternal name of his; for it is holie: let vs continuallie come before the Lord, and worſhip him; for he is holie.
                           For what ſhould we rather doo, than to giue hartie and continuall thanks, by all poſſible meanes, vnto God; who, beſides that he is God, and therefore hath bound all men vnto himſelfe by good right, hath beſtowed vpon vs ſo manie peculiar benefits? And againe, what can be more ioifull, and more to be deſired, than ſuch a teſtimonie of his fatherlie loue, who hath deliuered vs from ſo manie, not onlie dangers, but deaths alſo?
                        
                        
                           CAP. IIII.
                           
                              GO to alſo, O all ye Kings, Princes, Gouernours, and Iudges of the earth; hold vp your hands humblie vnto God the eternall KING; acknowledge his power, which ſitteth vpon the moſt high heauens from all eternitie, as it were vpon a chariot, and maketh a terrible and moſt mightie ſound from the clouds.
                           O yee mightie Monarchs and Potentates of the world, now worſhip and praiſe ye the LORD our GOD together with me; doo him all poſſible reuerence: and reioice vnto him with feare and trembling, as I doo.
                           O ye Kings, and all ye of power, giue place vnto the Lord; giue vnto the Lord, I ſaie, the honour of all glorie and power: giue vnto the Lord the maieſtie and glorie due vnto his name, fall downe before his footeſtoole, and worſhip him in his moſt holie temple: for he is holie; and ſeeke his glorie carefullie, as I doo.
                           For this chieflie becommeth all Princes to doo, whom God, of his vnſpeakable fauour, hath conſecrated

vnto himſelfe, and brought them into the moſt high ſtate of dignitie, aboue others: but ſpeciallie, it becommeth me to reioice, and to ſet foorth thy praiſes, O God, after a moſt exquiſite maner; in whom thy moſt excellent Maieſtie doth ſo gloriouſlie ſhine, and who haue receiued ſo manie rare and ſingular benefits of thee, from my conception, to this houre.
                           Go to then, O my deere ſoule, and mine inward bowels, giue thanks vnto God with all your power: praiſe the Lord, O my ſoule, and declare thy ſelfe that thou art mindfull of all his benefits.
                           For what honour is not the Lord woorthie of, which of his vnſpeakable mercie and compaſſion hath forgiuen thee all thy ſinnes, healed the deadlie wounds thereof, cured thy diſeaſes, borne thine infirmities, redeemed thy life from death, preſerued thee from miſerie, renewed thy youth like the Egle that liueth moſt long, and adorned thee ſo richlie with all his benefits; as teſtimonies of his ſingular goodnes, and fatherlie mercie towards thee?
                           Go to therefore with me, you mightie ſpirits, being his apparitours, and the diligent executioners of his will; ſo ſoone as ye heare him ſpeake, celebrate yee the praiſes of the Lord.
                           O yee mightie armies of his moſt obedient ſouldiours, praiſe the Lord, I ſaie; O ye, euen the verie Angels, worſhip him as your Lord and King.
                           Praiſe ye the Lord, O all his works, in what place ſoeuer of his dominion; and whatſoeuer hath breath, let it ſound and ſet foorth his glorie: finallie, thou my deere ſoule ſet thou foorth the praiſe of God.
                        
                        
                           CAP. V.
                           
                              AND I, O my God, my King, euen I thy handmaid and annointed, in thankefull remembrance, and worthie memoriall of thy woonderfull works and benefits, wrought

and ſhewed vnto me continuallie, doo againe (as it is meete) render vnto thee this acceptable ſacrifice of praiſe and thankeſgiuing.
                           I paie the vowes vnto thee, which I haue promiſed both ſecretlie among the faithfull, and openlie before the whole aſſemblie of thy people; and that in the courts of thy houſe, O Lord; and in the mideſt of the Citie Ieruſalem, wherein by thy power and benefit I thus flouriſh.
                           I will praiſe thee with my whole hart, and magnifie thy name for euer; becauſe I haue experience of thine infinite goodneſſe in my ſelfe, and am deliuered from ſo manifold dangers of death and deſtruction.
                           Neither will I be aſhamed to ſing foorth thy praiſes alſo in ſongs, before the aſſemblie of the mightie, and before the verie Angels that ſtand about thine arke.
                           I will, together with all Angels, Spirits, & ſoules; and with all Kings, Queenes, virgins, and creatures both in heauen and earth, inceſſantlie magnifie thee in the palace conſecrated to thy Maieſtie; and will ſing of thy mercie and truth, becauſe thou haſt gotten vnto thee now at the length moſt great honour; for that thou haſt ſo maruellouſlie, aboue expectation, ſurelie performed vnto me that which thou didſt promiſe in thy word.
                           I, with the reſidue of the people of my dominion, as a mother with hir daughters, and the virgin with virgins; being for this cauſe repleniſhed with incredible ioie, and comforted with thy iudgments, O Lord, will reioice in thee, which (ſeeing nothing in me that ſhould ſo moue thee) haſt neuertheleſſe embraced me with ſo great fauour, and mightilie alſo defended me: and with all the iuſt I will magnifie the holie remembrance of thee, ſo great a King continuallie, which ſitting vpon thy moſt holie throne, ruleſt the whole earth, and exalteſt thy ſelfe far aboue all that is aloft

anie where.
                           For to this end chieflie thou, O Lord, haſt conſecrated and ſet me ouer them, that I ſhould diligentlie exerciſe the rites of thy diuine worſhip among them. Therefore I will delight my ſelfe in ſetting foorth thy praiſes more and more, and I will teſtifie my ſelfe in my whole life, to be deſirous of thy honour and glorie, to whome all honour and glorie of right belongeth.
                           O my God, my King; I will highlie extoll thee, and celebrate thy name for euer and euer: I will conſecrate all the daies of my life to ſet foorth thy glorie, and will amplifie thy name with ſongs, that neuer ſhall haue end.
                           For thou art great, O Lord; and no praiſe is ſufficient for thee: neither can anie man attaine to thy greatneſſe.
                           For thy woonderfull works endure not for one generation and age alone; but as one age ſucceedeth another, ſo likewiſe muſt ſome men commit the memoriall of them vnto others, vnleſſe they will be negligent in dooing their dutie.
                           Wherefore trulie, be it far from me thy handmaid, that anie thing ſhould be of greater authoritie with me, than that I ſhould carefullie thinke, that the brightneſſe of thy Maieſtie, which ſhineth vnto vs in the verie dailie vſe of things; and that thy deeds to me and my people-ward are greater, than can be comprehended, by the admiration or capacitie of all mortall men and women.
                           And doubtleſſe, Lord, though verie manie be moſt blockiſh, and woonderfull thankeleſſe; yet can there neuer be wanting ſome, which ſhall euen againſt their willes confeſſe at the leaſt thy terrible power, euen ouer all princes and people of the world. But admit that others be ſilent, and vnthankefull; yet I will neuer ceaſe to declare thy greatneſſe; and the nations

moſt far off ſhall heare me publiſhing thy praiſes, and ſinging vnto thee, for deliuering and ſauing me by thy power, whome thou haſt choſen and loued.
                           But God forbid, that I alone ſhould labour to doo this my dutie. For verelie, there will be alwaies ſome aſſemblie, which will by all meanes teſtifie the remembrance of thy peculiar goodneſſe, and thy moſt vndoubted promiſes.
                           Namelie, that thou art moſt mercifull, and moſt readie to exceeding mercie; and of whome a man may almoſt doubt, whether thou be more ſlowe to wrath, or more prone to pardon.
                           For is there anie thing, O Lord, void of thy goodneſſe? Naie, what is there in this whole world anie where, which doth not teſtifie thy clemencie, and euen of it ſelfe ſet foorth thy glorie in this point, that thou dooeſt ſuffer ſo manie generations and ages to paſſe and ſucceede in this world, that is defiled ſo manie and fundrie waies: and that thou dooeſt cauſe thy choſen people to knowe, and declare by experience, what thy dominion and power is, that is to ſaie, to be publiſhers of thy praiſe and valiant acts, for committing the glorie of thy kingdome to their poſteritie.
                           Wherefore by good right, O Lord, I will giue vnto thee due and conuenient praiſe, & declare thy woonderous works, euen with a ſounding voice; that all may heare, as it becommeth me; & all men, to whom thou granteſt the vſe of this life, to doo both diligentlie, and continuallie.
                           As for me, I will ſtill call to mind the multitude of thy miracles, and woonderous works wrought for me; and I will conſume all my life daies in praiſing thee therefore, ſo long as I ſhall remaine aliue. It ſhall be my ſpeciall care to publiſh thy renowne with ſongs of praiſe. And would to God that my ſongs might be ſo pleſant and acceptable vnto thee, as I with glad hart

and cheerefull mind will celebrate thy ſo manie and ſo great benefits beſtowed vpon me.
                           And be it far awaie, and God forbid, O my ſoule, that euer we ſhould forget the Lord our God. But let rather my right hand forget hir cunning, and all plaieng of inſtruments: and let the tongue of euerie one of vs rather cleaue to the roofe of our mouthes, than that it ſhould be once vnmindfull of him; or at anie time abandon the due deſerued praiſes, belonging to his moſt holy, glorious, mightie, and eternall name and Maieſtie.
                           O all ye creatures in heauen and earth, agree yee vnto me, and ſaie herevnto with one hart and mouth, Amen. Praiſe ye the Lord; praiſe thou thy God, O my ſoule:
                           Amen, Amen.

                              AND now, O Lord, my God, and King; I thine handmaid being appointed QVEENE by thee, after ſuch a maner of bountifulneſſe, as neuer was heard, doo conſecrate this ſong vnto thee, both of mercie and iudgement: wherevnto I doo vow and bind my ſelfe before thee this daie, to performe them in the gouernment of the kingdome; as thou both fatherlie requireſt of me, and gratiouſlie haſt commanded.
                           And firſt I will endeuour my ſelfe wholie to pietie and godlineſſe, and will labour diligentlie to preſerue and to amplifie thy Church, that thy pure worſhip may be continuallie exerciſed therein, with as great care, deuotion, and holineſſe as is poſſible.
                           I will go, I ſaie, into thy ſanctified houſe, O Lord; euen into the holie habitation of thy moſt true wiſdome will I enter, that I may there learne thy iudgements, and vnderſtand thy will reuealed, to doo to the

vttermoſt of my power, whatſoeuer thou requireſt and commandeſt a King to doo.
                           For I doo teſtifie before thee, that I deſire nothing more, than to viſite and behold thy glorious Maieſtie in thy Sanctuarie: and therefore will I haſten ſpeedilie to ſtand in the porches thereof, to taſte and ſee thoſe viſible ſignes of thy power and Maieſtie, ſhewed commonlie therein. For doubtleſſe, thy goodneſſe that offereth it ſelfe as it were there to be handled and felt, is more ſweet by far, than life it ſelfe, which cauſeth my ſoule ſo much the more to be inflamed with earneſt deſire to ſeeke thy face, to ſee thy glorie, and to ſet foorth thy praiſes with all my power.
                           Eſpeciallie, that the people, which are holie vnto thee, my God, might aſſemble together by tribes and thouſands, after the maner apointed of thee, to powre foorth praiſes and praiers, and to celebrate thy holie name, to the ſafetie and preſeruation of all the families of our nation, that loue and fauour thy truth, to all poſteritie.
                           Yea, euen I my ſelfe, O God, with my father DAVID, will gladlie go foorth with the multitude; and lead thy people, as he was woont, into thy holie houſe, O God, with the voice of ioifull praiſings and thankſgiuings; as thoſe that obſerue thy ſabaoths and feſtiuall daies, moſt glorious vnto thee, before the face of all people.
                           I will preſent my ſelfe often before thine altar, not onlie with my hands waſhed in water; but rather purified from all wickednes, that I may openlie ſtabliſh thy praiſe, and celebrate thy woonderfull works.
                           There will I ſound foorth thy renowme with lowd voice, with all my hart, ſatiſfied with the fatneſſe and marowe of thy moſt holie delicates. I will lead my life therein, I ſaie, O God, ſetting forth thy magnificence; and there will I lift vp mine innocent hart and hands with others; and openlie, amids the whole multitude,

call vpon thy name, wherein is my ſafegard.
                           For there is nothing that I loue more deerlie than that Temple, wherein thou haſt ſet thy ſeate of glorie, euen the houſe of thy Maieſtie and holie Citie, wherein the tribunall ſeate of my father DAVID (left to his poſteritie to miniſter iuſtice indifferentlie to euerie one) is firmelie placed.
                           And why ſhould not I doo ſo? Why ſhould not my ſoule, I ſaie, he thus inflamed, and the zeale of thine houſe euen conſume mee with feruent deſire, and hartie longing, to ſeeke thy face, O Iacob? Seeing I haue had experience ſo oft of thy gratious goodneſſe and miraculous helpe; and ſeeing thou, O Lord, my God, haſt ſet thy houſe in Ieruſalem, that thy true worſhip might be by my diligence holilie exerciſed therein.
                           Therefore, O God, I, euen I thine handmaid, to whom thou haſt appointed the kingdome, will reioice and praiſe thee in thy ſacred Sanctuarie; and ioine my ſelfe as companion with thoſe that doo worſhip thee trulie and deuoutlie therein: neither will I be far or long from thence; if I be, Lord, it ſhall be full ſore againſt my will, through ſome vrgent neceſſitie of my calling or office in this life.
                           And though I be abſent in bodie at anie time from thy houſe, as manie times it commeth to paſſe, by reaſon I change my place ſo often: yet I make a vow, I will doo that I am able; to wit, wherſoeuer I become, I will cleaue vnto thee in my hart wholie, and will not ceaſe to thinke of thee, and to meditate of thy manifold benefits powred vpon me.
                           Yea, Lord, thou knoweſt that I am accuſtomed to riſe at mid-night, when other doo ſoundlie ſleepe: and ſetting aſide all other cares, as ſhe that is euer mindfull of thy ſtatutes, I doo watchfullie thinke how I may pleaſe thee, and keepe thy commandements; and how I am woont to preuent the twy-light in the morning,

with my lowd praiers: yea, that I am ſo farre from following the example of the wicked, who lie ſnorting in ſin & ſecuritie; that contrariwiſe I, beholding the excellent iudgements of thy iuſtice, in crowning thy gifts in the righteous, ſeuen times a daie doo I celebrate thy praiſes: neither doo the watchmen doubtleſſe ſo carefullie keepe their watch, as I am diligent in meditating thy Heaſt and commandements.
                        
                        
                           CAP. II.
                           
                              ANd bicauſe, O Lord, though man be increaſed with neuer ſo high dignitie, riches, and honours: yet if he want thy wiſedome, hee ſhall be counted to differ little or nothing in this life from the brute beaſts, which wholie periſh: (For he doth not long remaine in this worldlie pompe and glorie; but all his power ſhall vaniſh and flowe awaie, like water ſpilt on the ground, and brought to naught:) I will therefore number my daies, while I haue time; ſo that I may betimes applie my hart vnto thy wiſedome, & endeuour my ſelfe to learne thy ſtatutes by thine inſtruction; and to be taught the true knowledge, ioined with ſuch a iudgement; whereby I may diſcerne all things aright, as it were by taſting a ſauourie thing; bicauſe I deſire to depend on thy commandements, and to fulfill thy Heaſt.
                           Uerelie, Lord; I will meditate thy commandements continuallie, and will applie my whole mind to obſerue thy waies. I will delight my mind, I ſaie, in thy ſtatutes, neither will I at anie time forget thy words.
                           For neither haſt thou, O Lord, my heauenlie father, commanded mee anie thing vnaduiſedlie in thy Heaſt: neither are they things that I ſhuld onlie vnderſtand, or lightlie conſider of: but thou haſt wiſelie ſpoken and commanded them vnto me, that they ſhould be obſerued and kept of me with all diligence.
                           
                              
And would to God that my maners and ſtate might ſo be ordered by thy gouernement, that I might ſincerelie ſeeke to pleaſe thee; and holilie walke after the rule of the doctrine preſcribed by thee; & that I might moſt conſtantlie perſeuere in keeping moſt carefullie thy ſtatutes! For then verelie I ſhould leade an vpright and blameleſſe life, at harts eaſe, with a quiet mind, and all things ſhould go well with me; yea, by that meanes ſhall I onelie worſhip thee rightlie, and purelie, without following this or that maner of worſhip, not preſcribed by thy lawe, nor alowed by thy word.
                           Therefore am I fullie purpoſed to keepe thy ſtatutes firmelie to the end, and to hold the waie preſcribed by thy word. For I haue choſen this as the true waie, and I doo prefer this before all other things.
                           O Lord, I endeuour my ſelfe, I ſaie, with a pure hart, to cleaue faſt vnto thoſe things, which are approoued by thy teſtimonies; of the which my good purpoſe grant, I beſeech thee, that I doo neuer repent.
                           But direct me that am well entred into the waie of theſe thy precepts, and inflame me wholie more & more with great deſire, both of true knowledge ioined with iudgement, wherby I may diſcerne all things aright; and alſo keepe thy lawes, as well in proſperitie as aduerſitie, vnto the end of my life; that I may finiſh the whole courſe of my reigne, by the direction of thy precepts, which are mine onelie counſellers; thy mercie and thy truth being my two keepers and aſſiſtants, wherevpon I alſo onlie truſt.
                           Neither am I, O Lord, of their number, who haue no regard whither they walke, in the right or wrong waie before thee: but I haue ſearched carefullie by good aduiſe, what waie I ſhould keepe; and I haue faſtened my ſteps in thoſe paths, which thou haſt teſtified doo pleaſe thee. Neither haue I ſtaied, when I did

knowe the matter ſo to be; but ſtraightwaies bent my ſelfe to obſerue thy commandements, and beene moſt willing and readie to accompliſh thy will, in all things that might aduance thy glorie.
                           Oh how do I loue thy doctrine! Surelie thou knowſt Lord, that I am woont to conſume whole daies and nights in meditating of thy lawes. And I doo find, by experience, that I haue not done this in vaine. For I haue proued to be much wiſer by thy precepts, than all mine aduerſaries, which labour with all their power to deſtroie me, of how great dignitie or authoritie ſoeuer they be. For I haue obteined by thy gift, a wiſdome that will neuer forſake me.
                           Yea thou haſt made me better learned than my teachers and maiſters, euen becauſe I haue giuen my ſelfe wholie, not to mans inuentions, but to meditate thoſe things onlie, which thou haſt giuen vnto vs for ſound learning.
                           Finallie, I am more ſkilfull than anie of the ancient; becauſe I was bent not onelie to knowe thy commandements, but alſo to keepe them in deede. For I held backe my feete, that I ſhould not go the waie that leadeth vnto euill; but that I ſhould alwaies rather hold the waie, which thou haſt taught vs by thy mouth.
                           Thy precepts, O Lord, haue bene, and ſhall be like a burning Lampe in my hand; and as a light ſhining before me, to ſhew me the waie that I ſhall go: yea they haue taught me the true wiſdome. And therefore I now abhor the other guids & rules of the order of this life, as wicked and falſe. For I ſee all the moſt abſolute and perfect works come to an end: yea both the decrees & lawes, which mans wiſdome doth ſet downe, to be ſubiect vnto change, and at length euen to come to naught. Onlie thy precepts, moſt true and moſt ſtable, are prolonged without meaſure, and without

anie end. Wherefore, I am wholie conſumed, being inflamed with the loue of thee; becauſe I ſee thy words deſpiſed of mine aduerſaries.
                           Surelie I feele thy words more pleaſant and ſweet to my mouth, than if I had taſted honie; yea thy precepts are more pretious vnto me, than anie gold or iewels, be they of neuer ſo high price and eſtimation.
                           I doo, and will ſtill affirme, that all thy commandements are the moſt certaine and perfect rule of thy iuſtice and truth, to direct me to equitie and godlineſſe: and therefore I vtterlie abhor, as a thing appointed to deceiue vs, whatſoeuer leadeth vs from them: neither will I at anie time forſake thee, nor turne from thy lawes; but reſt vpon thee, my teacher, and ghoſtlie inſtructer.
                           O Lord, thou knoweſt that I hate and abhorre all deceits, I ſaie; and that I embrace thy doctrine: yea and that I neuer conceiued more greefe of anie thing, than when I did perceiue thoſe men, that are thine and mine enimies, to deſpiſe thy word ſo ſtubbornelie and impudentlie.
                           Mine eies verelie doo ſwimme with teares, when I behold the generall contempt of thy doctrine, and too bold prophanation of all thy holie Heaſts and lawes, the which thing I neither would nor could diſſemble. For euen ſo oft as I perceiued thy glorie to be diminiſhed, I burnt with ſorowe; & I accompted my ſelfe to be wounded with the reproches caſt out againſt thee. Uerelie, there is nothing more pure than thy words. Wherefore I, euen I thy ſeruant, doo embrace them with an incredible loue and deſire: yea I haue bound my whole heart for euer, euen to my laſt gaſpe, to obſerue thy ſtatutes.
                        
                        
                           
                           CAP. III.
                           
                              IAm determined, O Lord, to imbrace with moſt great loue, thoſe things, which thou haſt teſtified vnto me; and to keepe all thy Heaſts moſt diligentlie: yea, I will ſo behaue my ſelfe in this my gouernement, that none ſhall worthilie complaine of me, that I haue committed anie thing againſt them, contrarie to right and equitie. For I doo beare thy Heaſt in my hand, as a Lampe ordeined of thee, for to lighten me in thy perfect paths and waie. And I laie vp thy word in my hart as a pretious treaſure, leaſt I offend thee in anie leaſt thing.
                           And how ſincerelie I doo this; that is, how without all hypocriſie I applie my ſelfe to fulfill thy commandements, and to accompliſh and doo to the vttermoſt of my power, all things that thou haſt teſtified vnto me, it is beſt knowne vnto thee, who being my witneſſe, and priuie to all my thoughts and doings, I doo whatſoeuer I doo.
                           O Lord, vnto whome I appeale; and whome I can not deceiue, though I would: I am throughly knowne and manifeſt vnto thee I ſaie. For no part of my life is vnknowne vnto thee, whether I ſit or I riſe: yea thou doeſt euen vnderſtand all my thoughts a far off; and thou obſerueſt narrowlie my walking, and my lieng downe; neither is anie of thoſe things hidden from thee, which I go about. For thou knoweſt euen my words, O Lord, before my tongue pronounce them.
                           I ſubmit my ſelfe, O God, in this thing therefore to thy triall; how I doo prefer the conſideration of thy woonderfull works, words, and benefits, before all others; which are ſo great verelie, that I am not able once to accompt the ſumme of them, nor to reach to the height, depth, length, and bredth of thy great mercies towards me. For I find them mo than the ſands

of the ſea, or the heares of my head. Wherefore I onlie refer my ſelfe to thee my God, I ſaie, that thou maieſt throughlie prooue thine handmaid, and ſee if my hart be not altogether fixed vpon thee; and vtterlie ſearch out all my thoughts, to write them downe in thy booke of conſciences.
                           Finallie, conſider Lord, I praie thee, whether I haue prouoked the vngodlie, with giuing anie offence: & as thou knoweſt me innocent, ſo preſerue thou me, and gouerne the courſe of my life with thy counſels.
                           Yea thou knoweſt, O Lord, that I haue neuer bent mine eies to high things; nor entangled my ſelfe willinglie with great matters, whereby I might win to my ſelfe the opinion of excellencie, aboue all other: neither yet haue reached vnto ſuch things, as were aboue my capacitie. But contrarilie, vnleſſe I haue bene content with my ſtate howſoeuer; and haue ſtaid my mind to depend wholie on thee, as they teach the weaned child to forget the Nurſſe, and to regard the mother alone: vnleſſe, I ſaie, I haue ſo behaued my ſelfe hitherto, as the weaned infant, let me in deede be refuſed of thee.
                           Therefore, according to this mine innocencie, O Lord, by the aſſiſtance of thy grace, I will proceed: yea ſurelie, Lord, according to my power, as I haue begon in thee, ſo I will endeuour my ſelfe to end in thee, and to walke with thee vprightlie; and ſetting all my confidence in thee alone, I am fullie minded to continue to the end of my life, without wauering in the faith of a right Chriſtian feare and loue to thee.
                           That I ſtand vpright in the waie of thy truth, I doo attribute it onlie vnto thee, O Lord my God; and will therefore magnifie thy name in the publike congregation. And I doubt not, but thou, O Lord, thine owne ſelfe, wilt ſullie performe the worke that I haue enterpriſed by thine authoritie. For this is thine euerlaſting

mercie, teſtified by thy word: neither wilt thou, I knowe, leaue the worke vnperfect, which thou haſt once begun by me, and in me.
                           And now ſurelie mine eies are ſtill alwaies bent vpon thy goodneſſe, and I haue appointed thy truth to be the guide and leader of my life: yea, I vnfeinedlie vow, and make a ſolemne promiſe before thee, and all thy holie Angels; that I will giue all poſſible diligence, both that I may throughlie knowe the right waie appointed by thee, and alſo may obſerue the ſame purelie, in my houſe and Realme.
                           I will neuer ſet before me to doo anie wicked thing; but will endeuour my ſelfe to godlines more and more, and keepe my hands pure from all iniurie and wrong: that I may ſo liue the true life; and ſpend the whole courſe of this my peregrination, in ſetting foorth thy glorie.
                        
                        
                           CAP. IIII.
                           
                              HEnce from me therefore ye wicked ones, that I may keepe the precepts of my God ſo much more purelie. For I abhor the wauering and wanderings to and fro in religion; and I count thy word and doctrine moſt deere and pretious.
                           I will forſake them that are of corrupt maners; neither will I take ſuch vnto me. I will put far from me the authors of euill counſels; neither will I embrace, at anie time, the thing that I knowe to be euill.
                           Yea, Lord, thou knoweſt how carefullie I haue auoided the companie of theſe moſt vaine men; and I haue fled awaie from theſe deceitfull dealers.
                           They that run after another God, I vtterlie deteſt. Their drinke-offrings of bloudie ſacrifice, which I am afraid euen once to name, will I not offer. All ſuch abhomination my ſoule doth vtterlie abhor.
                           For I, as thou knoweſt, loue righteouſneſſe and holineſſe,

and hate whatſoeuer is againſt it. And bicauſe they hate thee, O Lord, which art righteouſneſſe it ſelfe; therefore doo I againe hate them, and doo euen abhor them, bicauſe I perceiue them to riſe vp againſt thee.
                           I hate the ſuperſtitious crue of the vngodlie, I ſaie, vtterlie; and count them for my greateſt enimies: much leſſe will I ioine my ſelfe vnto them, or can abide to winke at their wickedneſſe and rebellion.
                           Yea, I fullie determine to exerciſe thy power giuen vnto me, and to deſtroie the wicked and prophane vtterlie; that thy Church may be well purged, and free from theſe cruell and bloud-thirſtie hypocrites; from theſe men, I ſaie, which ſpeake blaſphemie againſt thee: ſo great and ſo proud is the crueltie of thoſe, not of mine enimies ſo much, as of thine. For they abuſe thy holie name and Maieſtie.
                           Thoſe ſuperſtitious men, I ſaie, Lord, that beare thy name in hypocriſie, ſhall haue their mouthes ſtopped, and be put to ſilence in the congregation; and that bicauſe they be deadlie enimies to thy word and holie Goſpell, which I profeſſe.
                           Therefore, bicauſe they reſiſt not me; but thee, O God, thy ſelfe: therefore thou ſhalt carie in thy hand a cup full of troubled wine, and full of dregs, the which thou ſhalt giue to all the wicked to ſucke vp, and to drinke euen the verie dregs thereof. Yea, with the edge of the ſword will I cut off the horns of the wicked and rebellious; and will execute the iudgement appointed and commanded by thee my God, vpon them, till they be conſumed; that the honor & dignitie of thy Saints may flouriſh in Iſrael in all pietie and peace.
                           All thoſe wicked men, whom I ſee or heare doo abuſe their authoritie vnder me, againſt the good and godlie, will I caſt downe againe; but I will increaſe the iuſt with honours.
                           
                              
The ſubtill man will I thruſt out of my houſe; neither will I ſuffer thoſe that be ſcoffers, and ſpeake deceiptfullie, to tarrie in my ſight.
                           The extortioner and cruell man, which doo ſpeedilie put in execution their wicked deuiſes, and whoſe hands are full of bribes, thoſe will I vtterlie deſtroie from off the earth.
                           I will bridle the proud and diſſolute perſons, I will terrifie the wicked, that they ſhall not lift vp their hornes ſo high, with blaſphemous words againſt thee, and thine annointed.
                           Finallie, I will deſtroie the ſlanderer and falſe accuſer; I will not ſuffer the proud and the ambitious to diſhonor thee. Yea I will painefullie, and without anie delaie, worthilie puniſh whomſoeuer I ſhall vnderſtand to be wicked; and will purge the holie Citie of the Lord from all wicked perſons.
                           Contrariwiſe, I ſearching out on euerie ſide men that loue the truth, will take them to be my familiar companions and counſellers; and I will not vſe, in dooing mine affaires, anie but ſuch as are truſtie and faithfull, both to God, and their Prince.
                           If I doo knowe anie that feareth thee, and that keepeth thy ſtatutes, I will ioine him to my fellowſhip: thoſe (I ſaie) whome I ſee doo worſhip thee trulie and deuoutlie, will I ioine my ſelfe as companions with me.
                           Yea, all my delight, Lord, ſhall be vpon the Saincts that are in the earth with me, to comfort them; and to promote ſuch as excell in vertue and godlineſſe. For otherwiſe, I am able to doo little or nothing that can profit thee. Neither will I ſuffer anie violence to bee done vnto them that be godlie, by anie man; but will rebuke euen the mightie Princes for their ſakes. None ſhall touch thine annointed Prieſts, no man will I ſuffer to hurt anie of thy Prophets.
                        
                        
                           
                           CAP. V.
                           
                              TO conclude, I will ſurelie care for nothing ſo much, now that I am ſet peaceablie ouer the kingdome, and haue the people by thy goodneſſe committed vnto me, as to inſtitute an holie and righteous gouernement. And thou granting me grace, when the caſe ſo ſtandeth, that the bonds of the lawes are broken, and the kingdome is in anie thing diſordered or confounded; I will carefullie compoſe, and ſet the ſame againe in good order; and eſtabliſh the pillers and foundations thereof in their places, if they be remoued. And this will I doo by the direction of thy reuealed will, that all things may remaine ſafe among my people, by the difference of right and wrong preſerued and mainteined; and that they may followe thee, our God, with great cheerefulneſſe, whoſoeuer delight in righteouſneſſe, when they ſee the diſordered ſtate of the Realme reſtored by me at the laſt, into the ancient moſt right order of diſcipline and iuſtice, preſcribed by thy word.
                           Thus, by the grace and aſſiſtance of thy holie ſpirit, (the which I beſeech thee plentifullie to powre downe vpon me) doo I thy ſeruant determine with my ſelfe, vnfeinedlie to ſerue and worſhip thy dreadfull Maieſtie, O my God, in feare and trembling: and I will labour to preſerue and to amplifie thy Church, with as great care as is poſſible; that thy pure worſhip may continuallie to all poſteritie be exerciſed therein.
                           For ſo haue I ſworne, euen by an oth, and make my ſolemne Uowes, that I will doo; & that I will keepe thy moſt ſacred Heaſts, and iuſt lawes inuiolable; the which thing I will performe in deede. Neither will I ſuffer my ſelfe, at anie time, to be drawne awaie from thy iudgements; nor to depart one ynch from thy holie commandements, O God, which waie ſoeuer thou

leadeſt me. But truſting onelie vnto thee, by whoſe power and conduct I haue gotten the Empire and regiment of ſo manie large prouinces, ſtrong cities, and goodlie townes; I will now ſet my kingdome in good order, and place the throne of iudgement therein, euen the tribunall ſeate of my father DAVID, that iudgement and iuſtice may be miniſtred indifferentlie therein to euerie one; and the ſafetie and welfare of the people that loue thee, and fauour thy truth, be procured and maintained.
                           For to this end, O my God, haſt thou giuen me this kingdome, the poſſeſſion of ſo manie goodlie countries, and ſundrie ſorts of people; and cauſed me to obteine it with ſo great facilitie and eaſe; that being thus peaceablie placed therein, I ſhould loue Ieruſalem with all my hart: and that I ſhould root out all the inhabitants therein, that prophane the land with filthie ſuperſtition, and euill life; and cauſe all diligentlie to obſerue thy ſtatutes and lawes, giuen them of thee. And ſo I make a Uow I will, O Lord, I ſaie, according to the ſimplicitie of my hart, both prouide faithfullie for thy people; and alſo guide them by good counſell, and continuallie defend and preſerue them by my power; as thou in thy heaſt haſt commanded me.
                           And that I may the better perfourme theſe my Uowes vnto thee, and thoroughlie diſcharge my dutie to the glorie of thine eternall Maieſtie; I beſeech thee, ſhew me thy glorie, O God; and let thine honour beautifie and adorne me, O my KING. O gouerne thou our counſels and endeuours from heauen; yea all our enterpriſes, and our counſels guide and gouerne thou from the higheſt heauens; that thy glorie, O Lord, thy glorie may ſhine foorth in me thine humble Haudmaid, to all poſterities; and the fame thereof fill the whole world, and be perpetuallie praiſed of al thy creatures, both in heauen and in earth, viſible and inuiſible, for

euer and euer: So; euen ſo ſhall it be, O my GOD: euen ſo let it be, Amen: Amen.
                           
                           O Lord, I beſeech thee, let the Uowes and free promiſes of my mouth, proceeding from an vnfeined hart, be accepted of thee; and teach me thy lawes more and more. For vnto thee and them I confes that I owe my life.
                           
                              Greſſus meos dirige verbo tuo: & non dominetur in me peccatum.
                              Sic pſallam nomini tuo in perpetuum: & perſoluam vota mea per ſingulos dies.
                           
                           Glorie be to GOD on high; in earth peace; good will towards men: Halleluiah.

                           AWake out of thy heauie ſleepe and ſlumber, O my ſoule; ſhake off the deathfull ſlouth of this earthlie trunke.

Ariſe, get thee before the Lord of grace and mercie, in lowlineſſe and repentance, and ceaſe not to praie for the forgiueneſſe of thy ſinnes.

                           WIth eies, hart, and hands lifted vp, O bleſſed God, and glorious Trinitie, I moſt entirelie thanke thee for all thy bountifull benefits beſtowed vpon me, and all mankind: eſpeciallie for that it hath pleaſed thee now in mercie to awake my bodie, to inlighten mine eies, to quicken my ſenſes; and to reuiue and renew me whole againe, as it were from the death of ſleepe, and that by the ſame ſpirit that raiſed Ieſus from the dead. I thanke thee that thou haſt not couered me with a ſpirit of ſlumber, nor ſhut vp mine eies in obſcure darknes, to cauſe me to ſleepe a perpetuall ſleepe, neuer to awake againe, nor to riſe from the euils wherein I laie, as by my ſinnes I haue iuſtlie deſerued.
                        O good Father, grant alſo, I beſeech thee, that as thou haſt awaked my body from ſleepe, and made mine eies to preuent the morning light: ſo vouchſafe in like mercie, thoroughlie to awaken, quicken, lighten, and deliuer my ſoule from all drowſineſſe, & ſleepe of ſinne, ſecuritie, and darkneſſe of this world, that from hence-foorth it neuer become emptie, faint, dead, or irkſome, with longing after the vanities of this brittle life: but liuelie, quicke, and readie to ſerue and glorifie thee, together with my bodie, with all good works of true chriſtianitie.
                        Oh deere God, that is but ſleepe to thee, which is death to vs; I hartilie beſeech thee therefore after death to reſtore to life that, which now is awaked out of ſleepe; and in the meane while to make my bodie ſuch a miniſter of godlineſſe to my ſoule, in this preſent life, that at the laſt, when in the beſſed reſurrection it

ſhall be awaked vp after thy likeneſſe, out of the long ſleepe of death, and called to appeare before thee, and all the holie Angels, it may ioifullie ariſe, and be partaker with the ſame of euerlaſting happineſſe in the life to come, and ioifullie behold thy face among the righteous, that ſo I maie be fullie ſatiſfied both in bodie and ſoule, with thy glorious preſence, and ioies eternall, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord,

And whatſoeuer I doo, or whatſoeuer I am, let the houre of thy ſudden comming ſo runne in my mind, and keepe me watching, that I may euer thinke, I heare this voice ſounding in mine eares: Ariſe yee dead, and come to iudgement.
                        In all time of our tribulation, in all time of our wealth, in the houre of death, and in the daie of iudgement, good Lord deliuer vs,

                        CAll oft to thy mind the houre of thy death, and be carefull ſo to liue euerie houre in Gods fauour, as though euerie houre were indéede to thée the laſt houre to die in his faith.
                        Remember alſo, that as there is no houre or inſtant of time in all our life, wherein we haue not the vſe of Gods great benefits, ſo ought there to be no moment, wherein we are not bound to haue him in perpetuall remembrance before our eies, to ſerue, loue, and praiſe his name, and that to the vttermoſt of our power, with all our hart, ſoule and ſtrength.
                     
                     
                        So ſoone as ye ſee the daie breake, and light appeare in the skie, praie.
                        
                        
                           
                              O
                            Day-ſtar moſt bright: O light moſt glorious and true, from whence this light of the daie dooth ſpring: O light which lighteſt euerie man that commeth into this world: without whome, all is moſt horrible darkeneſſe. How is light giuen to them that are in miſerie? and life to a wretch that hath a heauie hart? I looked for light, and behold, I haue found it: I wiſhed for daie, and lo, the ſtarres of the twy-light doo appeere; and I ſee (I thanke thee) the dawning of the daie. Darkeneſſe dooth no longer poſſeſſe the night, nor the ſhadowe of death ſtaine the daie. For the blacke mantell is gone, and the thicke clouds are diſpearſed, ſo that the light dooth begin to ſhine, and ſpread it ſelfe abroad to our comfort.
                        O that the night of perturbations being ouerpaſſed,

the morning light of comfort and grace might likewiſe ſpring in our hart! O that darkeneſſe might ſo be expelled, that light might be kindled, and the daie of gladneſſe and ioie luckilie ſhine vpon vs: that beeing tranſlated from darkenes to light, from periſhing into ſafegard, from death to life, from hell to heauen, we might continuallie praiſe thee, who onlie haſt immortalitie, and dwelleſt in the light that none can attaine vnto,
                        Amen.

                           BLeſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael, which hath redeemed his people, and deliuered vs out of the hands of all our enimies, and giuen vs free remiſſion of all our ſinnes, through the tender mercie of our God; whereby alſo the daie ſpring from an high, doth now viſit vs, to giue light to them that laie in darkeneſſe, and in the ſhadowe of death, and to guide our feete into the waie of peace: that we might ſerue him without feare, in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe before him, all the daies of our life,
                        Amen.
                        
                           Ye ſhall doo well, if ye take heed vnto the word, as vnto a light that ſhineth in a darke place, vntill the daie dawne, and the daie-ſtar appeare in your harts.

                        MUſe a little how much the light and eie of the mind and ſoule is better than of the bodie. And remember that we ought therefore much more to care for the ſoule, that it may ſée well, than for the bodie. Thinke alſo that beaſts haue bodilie eies as well as men: but men onlie haue eies of the mind, and that ſuch as are godlie wiſe.

Suffer I beſeech thee, that by the beames of his grace and beneuolence,

moſt louinglie ſhining and ſpread abroad, he may caſt his light into the world, and kindle in the harts of men a feruour of ſpirit. Let him come foorth as a bridegroome from his chamber; yea, let him appeare couragious as a valiant champion, to run through his courſe and iournie, euen till he haue conducted vs vnto the higheſt heauens, and holie citie Ieruſalem, where ſhall be no need either of ſunne or moone to ſhine, and where we ſhall walke with thoſe that are ſaued in the light of the Lambe, and glorie of God,

                        REmember thy maker, that knew thée before thou waſt, and knowe, that the eies of the Lord are tenne thouſand times brighter than the Sunne (than the which though nothing be more cléere, yet ſhall it faile.) For God, which liueth for euer, beholdeth all the waies of men, and the bottomleſſe depth; looking euen into mens harts, be they in neuer ſo darke and ſecret corners. And therefore, whereſoeuer thou art, and whatſoeuer thou dooeſt, feare thou the eies of God, more than the eies of men.
                        Now alſo, while the light is ſwéet, and it is a pleaſant thing to ſée the Sunne, remember the daies of darkneſſe that followe, and are manie. And looke that béetimes, before the Sunne ſet, or that the light of the moone and ſtarres be darkened, thou feare GOD, and vſe the light, walking therein as a child of light: knowing that he that maketh the Sunne to ſhine, and ariſe, both vpon the good and bad, will call thée to an account for thy works done both in darkneſſe and in light.

                           MOſt gratious and mercifull Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, thou knoweſt how we be borne, cloathed, and clogged with the greeuous & heauie burden of the firſt woman Eue, who fell

awaie vnto fleſhlineſſe, through diſobedience; vouchſafe therefore, I beſeech thee, to ſtrip me out of the old corrupt Eue, which being ſoked in ſinne, tranſformeth hir ſelfe to all incombrances and diſeaſes of the mind, that they may lead vs awaie from thee. Rid me alſo quite and cleane of that hir tempter, the deceitfull ſerpent, which turneth vs awaie from the obedience of the Father, So be it.

                           LOrd how wretched, miſerable, poore, blind and naked am I! I am naked, O Lord, yea euen ſtarke naked, for that thou ſeeſt me in my bloud and corruption. Open mine eies alſo, I beſeech thee, that I may more and more ſee my nakedneſſe; feele my miſerie, and confeſſe my wretchednes; that thou of verie pitie and compaſſion maiſt cloath me with thine innocencie, and holie vertues; and ſo couer my filthineſſe, that mine enimies neuer behold the ſame to my reproch. Finallie, giue me the grace of perfect charitie, to doo the works of faith acceptable to thee, eſpeciallie ſo to cloath the naked, and after my power to releeue the needie: that when I ſhall depart hence naked and bare, as euer I was borne, and ſhall carie awaie nothing of all my labours; yet in thy ſight, at the generall iudgement daie, I may not appeere naked of good works, or void of the marriage garment of faith, and the gifts of grace, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord,
                        Amen.
                        
                           Naked came I out of my mothers wombe, and naked ſhall I returne thither. Bleſſed be the name of the Lord.

                           PUt vpon me, O Lord, the pure garment of the innocencie and holines of Chriſt my Sauior. O couer thou my nakedneſſe and ſhame with the fine linnen robe of his righteouſneſſe and vertue; ſo ſhall not my filthineſſe be diſcouered vnto mine enimies, for them to gaze and laugh at; as curſed Cham did at the nakedneſſe of his father Noah. Yea, make thou my linnen cloaths as white as ſnowe, and ſhining like the light, that I maie be of the number of thoſe that haue beene called from the beginning of the world, and ſhall be ſanctified, that haue departed from the ſhadowe of the world, and ſhall receiue glorious garments; euen of thoſe holie ones, I ſaie, that haue put off the mortall cloathing, and haue put on the immortall, which haue confeſſed thee, O God, and thy Chriſt, and are alreadie crowned with glorie, and haue receiued palmes of victorie in their hands, triumphing ouer all their enimies, and policies of this world, So be it.

ſhall ſtand on thy right hand, and being clad with the long white robes and ſhining raines of the righteouſneſſe of thy Saints, who haue hated euen the garments ſpotted by the fleſh, and kept their conſciences vnpolluted with ſinne, and haue made their long garments white and cleane in the bloud of the Lambe Chriſt, I may togither with them enter into the holie citie, and remaine in the preſence of the throne of God, and ſerue thee ioifullie daie and night in thy holie temple, for euer and euer,

For if they be found cloathed, and not naked, mortalitie ſhall be ſwallowed vp of immortalitie, and they ſhall walke with GOD, in white araie.

                           O LORD Ieſu Chriſt, which diddeſt vouchſafe to die for our ſinnes, and diddeſt riſe againe for our iuſtification: haue mercie vpon me, and by that thy glorious reſurrection, I beſeech thee, raiſe me vp out of the bed of vices, and ſepulchre of all my ſinnes, wherein I haue long lien, to newneſſe of life. For except I be raiſed vp by thee, I ſhall lie ſtill for euer in darkeneſſe, ſhame, and miſerie. O therefore put foorth thine hand,

and mercifullie raiſe vp againe, not onlie my bodie, but my mind and hart alſo, to the true knowledge and loue of thee: that my conuerſation may be in heauen, where thou art. And giue me dailie part in the firſt reſurrection, to the intent that I may receiue ſome part in the latter reſurrection, and be in the number of thoſe thy faithfull ones, ouer whom the ſecond death ſhall haue no power, but are receiued into life euerlaſting.
                        
                           Ariſe & depart, for this is not your reſt. Mich. 2, verſe 20. I will ariſe now out of my bed, to open to my beloued that, knocketh; and I will go about the citie by the ſtreets, and by the open places, and will ſeeke him whom my ſoule loueth.

                        COnſider how fowle the fall of Adam and Eue was, by reaſon of their ſinne and tranſgreſſion: and ſo of euerie one of vs by them, from the high, excellent, and honourable eſtate of Gods grace, into ſhame and miſerie. Againe, thinke vpon the ineſtimable benefits of Chriſt Ieſus, by whoſe helping hand we dailie ariſe againe from our naturall and originall declining and fallings: and be thankfull vnto him therefore.

He rule me, keepe, bleſſe, and lead mee into all good works; and ſo direct and confirme me therein, that after ths fraile life ended, I may obteine a ioifull reſurrection, with bliſſe perpetuall,

                           GOd be mercifull vnto me, and bleſſe me this daie and euer; and ſhew me the light of his countenance, and be mercifull vnto me; that I may knowe his way vpon earth, and his ſauing health among all nations. God, euen our owne God giue mee his continuall grace, peace, mercie, and bleſſing.
                        And I beſeech thee, O Lord Ieſu Chriſt, which being reuiued from death to life, broughteſt againe to mortall men, that moſt deſired and greatlie longed for daie which the Lord made. Grant that I, being now raiſed vp from the death of ſinnes, to the life of grace, may walke in all Chriſtian obedience: and at the laſt daie of the reſurrection of all fleſh, when thou ſhalt be made manifeſt in our life, I alſo may then be openly known, and appeere before thee in glorie; and ioifullie triumph ouer ſinne, death and hell; ſaieng: O death, where is thy ſting? O graue, where is thy victorie? Thanks be vnto GOD, which hath raiſed me from the death of ſleepe, and giuen me victorie ouer all mine enimies, through our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, So be it.

Be thou vnto mee a garment to keepe me warme, and to defend me from the cold of this world. If thou be abſent, deere Lord, all things will be vnto me foorthwith cold, weake, and dead: but if thou be with me, all things will be warme, liuelie, freſh, and cheerefull.

                           OH wretch that I am, what am I but a rotten carcaſe, woorms meat, a ſtinking coffin, and food for fire? Againe, what am I, O Lord? Euen a darke dongeon, wretched, earth, a child of wrath, a veſſell meet for diſhonour; begotten in vncleanneſſe, liuing in miſerie, and dieng in diſtreſſe.

Out vpon me vile wreth! What am I? Wo is me, Lord. O Lord ſpare me. Alas, my maker; what ſhall become of me? I am a ſacke of doong, a coffin of rottenneſſe, full of lothſomneſſe and ſtinch; blind, poore, naked, ſubiect to manie exceeding neceſſities, woting neither when I came into the world, nor when I ſhall go out, mortall and miſerable; whoſe daies paſſe and glanſe ſwiftlie awaie, as a ſhadowe, or bubble of water, now flouriſhing, and by and by withering; now aliue, now dead. Oh ſpare me a little, Lord; for my daies are nothing: and be mercifull vnto a wretch, that is not aſhamed to acknowledge hir vileneſſe before thee.
                        
                           The glorie of mortall man is but doong, and wormes meate.

Thinke alſo what madneſſe it is, thus to pamper our bodies with delicate meats, to obeie the luſts therof, prouoking to euill: and deſire continuallie, with S. Paule, the diſſolution thereof, and to be out of this ſtinking priſon.

Sprinkle it, Lord, with the hyſſope of true repentance, and ſorowfull contrition; that being clenſed in the moſt cleere fountaine of

thy grace, I may be whiter than ſnowe; and alſo bee able euer hereafter to ſerue thee, in holineſſe and pureneſſe of liuing, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord,

Waſh my ſoule with the holie fountaine or well, which I beleeue did flow from thy hart, and naked ſide; and ſanctifie and purifie not onlie my hands and face from filth; but my hart, ſoule, and conſcience alſo, from all contagion of ſinne and iniquitie, that I may be pure both in bodie and ſoule, and ſerue thee in holineſſe and puritie, all the daies of my life, So be it.

I haue offended both heauen and earth, more than my tongue can expreſſe; my ſins are aboue all mens, both in number and greatneſſe, which I haue committed. Whither then may I go? And whither ſhould I flee? To heauen I may be aſhamed to lift vp my face; and in earth I find no place of refuge or ſuccour. To thee therefore, O Lord, doo I runne; to thee doo I humble my ſelfe, ſaieng: O Lord my God, my ſinnes be great and innumerable: but yet haue mercie vpon me, for thy great mercie. The great myſterie that God became man, was not wrought for little or few offences. Thou didſt not giue thy ſonne O heauenlie father vnto death for ſmall ſinnes onlie, but for all the greateſt ſinnes in the world: ſo that the ſinner returne vnto

thee with his whole hart, as I doo heere at this preſent. Wherefore haue mercie on me, O God, whoſe propertie is alwaie to haue mercie: wherefore haue mercie on me, O Lord, for thy great mercie. I craue nothing, O Lord, for mine owne merits, but for thy name ſake, that it may be halowed thereby, and for thy deere ſonne Ieſus Chriſtes ſake; and now therefore, Our father of heauen, halowed be thy name, &c.
                        
                     
                     
                        Another Confeſſion and praier.
                        
                           OH almightie euerlaſting God, and moſt gratious deere louing father, I beſeech thee, for Ieſus Chriſtes ſake, thy moſt deere and onlie ſonne, to haue mercie, pitie, and compaſſion vpon me, moſt vile, wretched, and miſerable ſinner: whoſe innumerable offenſes, both old & new, be moſt horrible, heinous, and great; where through I haue iuſtlie deſerued thy greeuous wrath, and euerlaſting damnation. But now, good Lord, heere I do appeale to thy great mercie onlie, which far ſurmounteth all thy works; as thou haſt promiſed the ſame in thy holie and infallible word, where thou haſt ſaid, yea and ſworne, as trulie as thou liueſt, that thou wilt not the death of a ſinner, but rather that he ſhould conuert and liue. Ah deere Lord, I confeſſe that I am a great and greeuous ſinner, and yet now by thy grace, and good working of thy holie ſpirit ſomething turned vnto thee. Oh let me liue, and not die the euerlaſting death of the ſoule, which I ſo deepelie haue deſerued; but make me a veſſell of thy great mercie, that I may liue and praiſe thy name among thy choſen children for euer. Oh let not my horrible ſinnes ſeparate me from the ſweet ſight of thy Maieſtie, but let thy great power and mercie be magnified in me, as it is in Dauid,

in Peter, in Magdalen, and in the notable Theefe which was crucified with Chriſt thy deere ſonne, in whoſe moſt pretious death and bloud-ſhedding onlie, O Lord, I put my whole truſt and confidence. For he onelie hath taken awaie the ſinnes of the world: he came not to condemne the world, but to ſaue it, that none that trulie beleeue in him ſhould periſh, but haue life euerlaſting. He ſaith, he came not to call the righteous, but ſinners to repentance.
                        Oh gratious God, giue me true, earneſt, hartie, and vnfeigned repentance, that I may, from the verie bottome of my hart, continuallie lament my manifold ſinnes and wickedneſſe, my great ingratitude and vnthankefulneſſe towards thee, for all thy mercifull benefits ſo aboundantlie powred vpon me, through Ieſus Chriſt: which wouldeſt vouchſafe, he being thine owne deere darling, in whome was and is all thy whole pleaſure and delight, to giue him for me to the verie death of the Croſſe: yea and that when I was thine vtter enimie, of mercie ineſtimable, and loue incomprehenſible. Who euer ſawe ſuch a thing? God became man, and was crucified for me, that by his death I might liue. Alas that euer I ſhould become ſo wicked a wretch, and vnkind a creature, to diſpleaſe ſo louing, kind, and mercifull a God and father. Oh forgiue me, forgiue me, for thy great mercie ſake, for thy truth and promiſe ſake; and I will neuer treſpaſſe againe againſt thy diuine Maieſtie anie more; but will gladlie ſerue thee in true holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, all the daies of my life, by the grace and aſſiſtance of thy good and holie ſpirit, the which I beſeech thee to giue me alſo, that he may gouerne me, and guide my hart, in thy true faith, feare, and loue: that in all my deeds, words, and thoughts, I may glorifie thy holie name, which liueſt, and reigneſt, with the ſonne, and the holie Ghoſt, three perſons and one God, to whome

be all honour, glorie, praiſe, thanks, power, rule and dominion, for euer and euer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another confeſsion of ſinnes, proper for the Sabaoth daie.
                        
                        
                           OH my moſt mercifull father, the father of mercies, and God of all conſolation and comfort, my God, my father; I moſt wretched ſinner confeſſe and acknowledge my ſelfe vnfeinedlie, with hart, mind & mouth, now before thee, to haue moſt greenouſhe offended thy high Maieſtie and goodneſſe. I recogniſe and acknowledge my ſelfe to be full of ſinne, full of vnfaithfulneſſe, and a ſeruant vnprofitable. For all thy holie commandements haue I tranſgreſſed and broken.
                        Firſt, I haue not ſet all my whole beleefe, confidence, truſt, and hope in thee. I haue not loued and honoured thee with all my hart, with all my ſoule, mind, and powers of my ſoule.
                        Secondlie, I haue diuided thine honour and worſhip from thee, and giuen it to thy creatures, and dead things imagined of mine owne fond fantaſie, I meane in the adoring and worſhipping of images.
                        Thirdlie, I haue abuſed thy moſt holie name, by falſe and deceitfull ſwearing, to the hinderance of my neighbour, and idlelie and vainlie haue I vſed thy holie name. I haue not ſaid, nor done, neither thought all things to thy glorie.
                        Fourthlie, in the Saboth daie, I haue not giuen my ſelfe to hearing, reading, & learning the holie Scriptures; neither haue I giuen meate to the hungrie, drinke to the thirſtie, lodged the harbourleſſe, clothed the naked, viſited the ſicke, comforted nor releeued the poore, and men in priſon. For I haue not expended of

how great weight theſe words of thy ſonne my Sauiour Chriſt are; neither beleeued him, ſaieng: In as much as ye haue done theſe things vnto one of the leaſt of theſe my brethren, ye haue done it vnto me. Matth. 25.
                        But I haue beſtowed and ſpent my gold and ſiluer after my lewd luſt and concupiſcence, in exceſſe of meat and drinke, in gorgeous apparell of my bodie, of my children, ſeruants, and houſe, &c. where I ſhould not haue beſtowed it (or elſe not ſo largelie, delicatelie, nicelie, and exceſſiuelie haue beſtowed it,) as I haue; not regarding in the meane time, to ſuffer the deere beloued brethren of Ieſu Chriſt to go naked, and to periſh for cold and hunger.
                        I haue, I ſaie, not ceaſed from mine owne ſinfull will and luſts, praieng at all times, thy will, and not mine, to be fulfilled.
                        Furthermore, I haue not honoured my father and mother; I haue not ſo much ſet by them, eſteemed them, and had them in ſuch reuerence, as thou commandeſt me; nor obeied them, neither comforted, releened, or helped them. I haue ſlaine, I haue broken wedlocke, I haue ſtolne, I haue ſold by falſe weights and meaſures, and borne falſe witneſſe: finallie, I haue coueted my neighbours houſe, I haue deſired his wife, his ſeruant, his cattell, & his other goods vnlawfullie.
                        Thus moſt greeuouſlie haue I ſinned infinit waies, O Lord, omitting and leauing thy commandements, Oh Father, to fulfill the deſire of my fleſh, the world, and the diuell. Wherefore I crie thee mercie, my God, moſt mercifull father; and moſt humblie I deſire and beſeech thee, for the loue which thou beareſt to thy deer ſonne, mine onelie, whole, and entire Sauiour Ieſu Chriſt, to haue mercie on me, and to forgiue me moſt miſerable ſinner, euen in his bloud, and for his pretious death ſake. For when I went about to ſeeke thee,

to truſt vnto thee, or to doo anie thing to thy glorie; yet would not this luſt and concupiſcence, that contagious originall poiſon, and fleſhlie dregges drawne of our father Adam, ſuffer me perfectlie to doo that I would haue done. Through this naturall concupiſcence, I ſtriue and fight dailie againſt the holie Ghoſt in me, which vnlawfull luſt and deſire I knowledge to be a greeuous ſinne againſt thy highnes, if thou ſhouldeſt iudge me ſtraitlie after thy Lawe, without the which concupiſcence I cannot be.
                        Wherefore I being a wretched, yea a moſt abhominable wretched ſinner in my ſelfe, cleerelie deſtitute of all righteouſneſſe, of all godlineſſe, of all holineſſe, and all deſeruings, am come now by faith before thee, vnto Chriſt his mercie ſeate and righteouſneſſe, vnto his goodneſſe, deſeruings, and ſatiſfactions; deſiring thee, O moſt mercifull father, for his deaths ſake, that his righteouſneſſe, his wiſedome, his holineſſe, his goodneſſe, his merits and ſatiſfactions may be mine, and ſerue for my forgiueneſſe and ſaluation. For like as thou gaueſt me him to die for my ſinnes; euen ſo beleeue I, that thou haſt giuen me with him all his to be mine, and to ſerue me for my ſaluation. Wherefore, glorie, honor, worſhip, empire, and rule be to thee, oh father, with the ſonne and the holie ghoſt for euer world without end, So be it.
                        
                     
                     
                        Another Confeſsion of ſinnes for Sundaies, to be vſed in the forenoone or afternoone.
                        
                        
                           O Moſt mercifull Lord God, my tender and deere father, vouchſafe, I hartilie beſeech thee, to looke downe with thy fatherlie eies of pitie vpon me, moſt vile and wretched ſinner, which lie heere proſtrate in heart before the feete of thy bottomleſſe mercie. For I haue ſinned againſt

the throne of thy glorie, and before thee, O moſt deere Father, inſomuch that I am not worthie to be called thy daughter. Yet neuertheleſſe, foraſmuch as thou art the God and Father of all mercie, and comfort; and againe, deſireſt not the death of a ſinner: but like a true Samaritan takeſt thought for my ſillie wounded ſoule; make me, I praie thee, by infunding of thy pretious oile of comfort into my wounds, ioifullie to run with the loſt ſonne into the lap of thine euerlaſting pitie. For lo, thou art my hope and truſt, in whom I onlie repoſe my ſelfe, hauing in thee full confidence and faith. And ſo I ſaie, with a verie faithfull hart, truſting in thy mercie: I beleeue in thee, O God the Father; in thee, O God the Sonne; and in thee, O God the holie Ghoſt; three perſons, and one true and verie God; beſides whom I acknowledge none other God in heauen aboue, nor in earth beneath.
                        Yea, and I poore ſinner doo accuſe my ſelfe vnto thee, deere Father, that I haue ſore and greeuouſlie offended thine almightie goodneſſe, and diuine Maieſtie, in committing of mine exceeding, greeuous, and manifold ſinnes and wickedneſſe. For I haue not kept the leaſt of thy moſt bleſſed commandements, like as thy righteouſneſſe may require and demand the ſame of me.
                        I haue, I ſaie, not honoured thee like my God, nor dreaded thee like my Lord, loued thee like my Father; truſted in thee like my Sauiour and Creator. Thy holie and dreadfull name, vnto which all honour and glorie belongeth, haue I vſed in vaine. I haue not ſanctified the Saboth and holie daies with works which be acceptable vnto thee, nor inſtructed my neighbour in vertue accordinglie. I haue not honoured my father and mother, nor beene obedient vnto them, through whom, as by an inſtrument, thou haſt wrought my comming into this world. The high powers and rulers, which take their authoritie of thee, I haue not

beene willinglie obedient vnto. I haue not kept my hart pure and cleane from man-ſlaughter: yea, had not thy mercie and grace defended me the better, I ſhould haue committed the verie deed alſo. I likewiſe am not pure from theft, nor from adulterie, nor from falſe-witneſſe-bearing: but haue in my hart and mind wiſhed and deſired my neighbours goods and things. I haue folowed the great Prince of the world Satan, which hath beene a lier from the beginning, in concupiſcence of the fleſh, in pride of liuing, in lieng, in deceitfulneſſe, in lecherie, in hatred and enuie, in backbiting, in deſpaire, and alſo in miſ-beleefe. My fiue wits alſo haue I fowlie miſ-vſed and ſpent, in hearing, ſeeing, ſmelling, taſting, and alſo feeling, which thou haſt giuen me to vſe to thy honour and glorie, and alſo the edification and profit of my neighbour.
                        But in what maner ſoeuer I haue offended and ſinned againſt thine eternall Maieſtie; (for no man knoweth throughlie his ſinnes, as the Prophet witneſſeth) whether it hath beene by daie, or elſe by night, yea euen from my childhood vnto this daie, were it in works, words, deeds, or thoughts; ſecretlie or openlie, O my mercifull God; I am ſorie for it, euen from the bottome of my hart: yea, my ſoule mourneth for ſorrowe, moſt mercifull Father, that I am not a thouſand times ſorier than I am. Howbeit, in token of great repentance, though all harts be knowne well inough to thee, I doo knocke and ſtrike my breaſt, and ſaie in bitterneſſe of hart and ſoule: Lord God Father haue mercie, Lord God Sonne haue mercie, Lord God holie Ghoſt haue mercie. Spare me of thine infinite goodneſſe and mercie, good Lord, now and all the daies of my life hereafter; and let me haue part of thine abundant grace, ſo as I maie change my ſinfull life, and put out of me the old man, with all his concupiſcences, and alſo that I maie die vnto the world,

and that the world may be a croſſe vnto me, and ſo go foorth in a new life.
                        Strengthen me, O Lord, in a true humble hart, in perfect loue, hope, and truſt in thee. Giue my ſoule grace to deſire thee onlie, in thee onlie to reioice and repoſe my ſelfe, and that I may vtterlie renounce and forſake the vaine affiance of this world: ſo that thou maiſt find me readie with the good ſeruant, and wiſe virgins, in the midnight of death, which ſhall ſuddenlie ſteale vpon me like a theefe, ere I be aware. Be thou vnto me at that time of need, O Lord, a tower of ſtrength, a place of refuge, and a defenſible God, namelie, againſt the face of the feend, who like a roring Lion ſhall be then moſt readie to deuoure me, and againſt deſperation, which then ſhall be buſie to greeue me. Let then thy comfort cleane faſt vnto me; thy mercie keepe me, and thy grace guide me. Fetch then againe, Lord God Father, that which thy puiſſant might hath ſhapen. Fetch then againe, Lord God Sonne, that which thou haſt ſo wiſelie gouerned, and bought with thy pretious bloud. Take then againe, Lord God holie Ghoſt, that which thou haſt kept and preſerued ſo louinglie, in this region of ſinne, & vale of miſerie. Three perſons, and one true and alſo verie God, to whom be all laud and praiſe for euer and euer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another confeſsion of ſinnes, and praier for mercie and grace, commonlie called, Conditor coeli.
                        
                           OH maker of heauen and earth, King of kings, and Lord of lords; which of nothing didſt make me to thine image and likeneſſe, and diddeſt redeeme me with thy pretious bloud, whom I a ſinner am not woorthie to name, to thinke on, neither to call vpon: I moſt humblie deſire

thee, and meekelie praie thee, that gentlie thou behold me thy wicked ſeruant, and haue mercie vpon me, which hadſt mercy of the woman of Canaan, & Marie Magdalen; which didſt forgiue the Publican, and the theefe hanging on the Croſſe. Unto thee I confeſſe my ſinnes, moſt holie Father, which if I would, I cannot hide from thee. Haue mercie on me, O Chriſt; for I am a wretch, and haue ſore offended thee in idolatrie, in ſuperſtition, in blaſphemie, in prophaning of thy Saboths, in diſobedience to my gouernours, in pride, in couetouſneſſe, in gluttonie, in lecherie, in vaine glorie, in hatred, in enuie, in murder, in adulterie, in theft, in lieng, in backbiting, and falſe-witneſſe-bearing, in ſporting, in dalliance, in diſſolute & wanton laughing, in idle words, in vncleane thoughts, in hearing, in taſting, in touching, in thinking, in ſleeping, in working; and finallie, in all waies, in which I a fraile woman, and moſt wretched ſinner might ſinne: My default, my moſt greeuous default.
                        Therefore I moſt humblie praie and beſeech thy gentleneſſe, which for my helpe didſt deſcend from heauen, which didſt hold vp Dauid, that he ſhould not fall into ſinne, haue mercie vpon me, O Chriſt, which didſt forgiue Peter thine Apoſtle, that did forſweare and forſake thee. Thou art my Creator and helper, my maker and redeemer, my gouernour, my Father, my Lord and God, my King and my ſpouſe. Thou art my hope, my truſt, my ſtrength, my defenſe, my redemption, my ſanctification, my life, my helth and reſurrection. Thou art my ſtedfaſtneſſe, my refuge & ſuccour, my light and onlie hope. I therfore moſt hartilie and humblie deſire thee to helpe me, defend me, and make me ſtrong, comfort me, make me ſtedfaſt; make me merie, giue mee light, and viſit me; reuiue me againe, which am dead: for I am thy making, and thy worke.
                        Oh Lord deſpiſe me not; I am thy ſeruant, thy bondwoman,

although euill, although moſt vnworthie, and a deteſtable ſinner. But whatſoeuer I am, whether I be good or bad, I am alwaies thine. Therfore to whom ſhall I flee, except I flee vnto thee? If thou caſt me off, who ſhall or will receiue me? If thou deſpiſe me, and turne thy face from me, who ſhall looke vpon me? Recogniſe and knowledge me, O Lord, to be thine; although vnworthie comming to thee, although I bee vile and vncleane. For if I be vile and vncleane, as I confeſſe my ſelfe in deede to be, thou canſt make mee cleane. If I be ſicke, thou canſt heale me. If I be dead and buried, thou canſt reuiue me: for thy mercie is much more than mine iniquitie. Thou canſt forgiue me more than I can offend. Therefore, O Lord, doo not conſider, nor haue reſpect to the number of my ſinnes; but according to the greatneſſe of thy mercie forgiue me, and haue mercie on me moſt wretched ſinner. Saie vnto my ſoule, I am thy health; which ſaiedſt, I will not the death of a ſinner, but rather that he liue, and be conuerted, and turne to thee. O Lord bee not angrie with me, I beſeech thee; but for thy great mercie ſake forgiue and pardon me all my miſdeeds, and bring me to the bliſſe that neuer ſhall ceaſe,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another forme of Confeſsion and praier to be vſed of the Maiſter and Miſtreſſe with their families in priuate houſes euerie morning.
                        
                           ALmightie God, and moſt mercifull Father; we doo not preſent our ſelues heere before thy Maieſtie, truſting in our owne merits or woorthineſſe, but in thy manifold mercies; which haſt promiſed to heare our praiers, and graunt our requeſts, which we ſhall make to thee, in the name of thy beloued Sonne Ieſus Chriſt our Lord: who hath alſo commanded vs to aſſemble

our ſelues together in his name, with full aſſurance, that he will not onelie be amongſt vs; but alſo be our mediator and aduocate towards thy Maieſtie, that we may obtaine all things, which ſhall ſeeme expedient to thy bleſſed will for our neceſſities. Therefore we beſeech thee, moſt mercifull father, to turne thy louing countenance towards vs; and impute not vnto vs our manifold ſinnes and offences, whereby wee iuſtlie deſerue thy wrath and ſharpe puniſhment: but rather receiue vs to thy mercie, for Ieſus Chriſtes ſake; accepting his death and paſſion; as a iuſt recompenſe for all our offences, in whom onlie thou art pleaſed, and through whome thou canſt not be offended with vs. And ſeeing of thy great mercies we haue quietlie paſſed this night; grant O heauenlie father, that we may beſtowe this daie wholie in thy ſeruice; ſo that all our thoughts, words and deedes may redound to the glorie of thy name, and good example to all men; who ſeeing our good works, may glorifie thee our heauenlie father. And foraſmuch as of thy meere fauour and loue, thou haſt not onlie created vs to thine owne ſimilitude and likeneſſe; but alſo haſt choſen vs to be heires with thy deere ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, of that immortall kingdome, which thou preparedſt for vs, before the beginning of the world; we beſeech thee to increaſe our faith and knowledge, and to lighten our harts with thy holie ſpirit, that we may in the meane time liue in all godlie conuerſation, and integritie of life; knowing that idolaters, adulterers, couetous men, contentious perſons, drunkards, gluttons, and ſuch like, ſhall not inherit the kingdome of God.
                        And becauſe thou haſt commanded vs to praie one for another, we doo not onlie make requeſt, O Lord, for our ſelues, and them that thou haſt alreadie called to the true vnderſtanding of thy heauenlie will: but for

all people and nations of the world, who as they know by thy wonderfull works, that thou art God ouer all; ſo they may be inſtructed by thy holie ſpirit, to beleeue in thee their onlie Sauiour and Redeemer. But foraſmuch as they can not beleeue, except they heare; nor cannot heare, but by preaching; and none can preach, except they be ſent: therefore, O Lord, raiſe vp faithful diſtributers of thy myſteries, who ſetting apart all worldlie reſpects, may both in their life and doctrine onelie ſeeke thy glorie. Contrariwiſe, confound Sathan, Antichriſt, with all hirelings, whome thou haſt alreadie caſt off into a reprobate ſenſe, that they may not by ſects, ſchiſmes, hereſies, and errors, diſquiet thy little flocke. And becauſe, O Lord, we be fallen into the latter daies, and dangerous times, wherein ignorance hath gotten the vpper hand; and Sathan by his miniſters ſeeke by all meanes to quench the light of thy Goſpell; we beſeech thee to mainteine thy cauſe againſt thoſe rauening Woolues, and ſtrengthen all thy ſeruants, whom they keepe in priſon and bondage. Let not thy long-ſuffering be an occaſion, either to increaſe their tyrannie, or to diſcourage thy children; neither yet let our ſinnes and wickedneſſe be an hinderance to thy mercies: but with ſpeede, O Lord, conſider theſe great miſeries. For thy people Iſrael manie times, by their ſinnes, prouoked thine anger; and thou puniſhedſt them by thy iuſt iudgement: yet, though their ſinnes were neuer ſo greeuous, if they once returned from their iniquitie, thou receiuedſt them to mercie. We therfore, moſt wretched ſinners, bewaile our manifold ſiunes, and earneſtlie repent vs for our former wickedneſſe, and vngodlie behauiour towards thee. And whereas we cannot of our ſelues purchaſe thy pardon, yet we humblie beſeech thee, for Ieſus Chriſtes ſake, to ſhew thy mercie vpon vs, and receiue vs againe to thy fauour. Graunt vs, deere father,

theſe our requeſts, and all other things neceſſarie for vs, and thy whole Church, our Queene and Realme, according to thy promiſe in Ieſus Chriſt our Lord; in whoſe name we beſeech thee, as he hath taught vs, ſaieng: Our Father, &c.
                        
                        Almightie and euerlaſting God, vouchſafe, we beſeech thee, to graunt vs perfect continuance in thy liuelie faith, augmenting and increaſing the ſame in vs dailie, vntill we growe to the full meaſure of our perfection in Chriſt, whereof we make our confeſſion, ſaieng: I beleeue in God the Father almightie, &c.
                        
                        Almightie God, which haſt promiſed to heare the petitions of them that aſke in thy Sonnes name, wee beſeech thee mercifullie to incline thine eares to vs, that haue now made our praiers and ſupplications vnto thee: and graunt that thoſe things, which wee haue faithfullie aſked according to thy will, may effectuallie be obteined, to the releefe of our neceſſitie, and to the ſetting foorth of thy glorie, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, Amen.
                        
                        The Lord bleſſe vs and ſaue vs, the Lord make his face to ſhine vpon vs, and be mercifull vnto vs; the Lord turne his fauorable countenance towards vs, and graunt vs his peace, Amen.
                        
                        The grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, the loue of God, and the communion of the holie Ghoſt, be with vs, and remaine with vs for euer, So be it.
                        
                     
                     
                        A Morning praier for Sundaie.
                        
                           AFter due examination of my former life, with an humble and contrite hart, with a ſorowfull and repentant ſpirit, I ſue vnto thee, moſt mercifull father; beſeeching thee of mercie and forgiueneſſe of mine offences, which in this night, or at anie time heeretofore, I haue committed

againſt thy godlie will and pleaſure, by anie manner of vncleanneſſe of ſoule or bodie, that I haue fallen into by the illuſion of the diuell; or elſe by frailtie of mine owne fleſh, treſpaſſing againſt thy godlie Maieſtie, either in thought, conſent, delectation, word or deede. And I moſt hartilie thanke thee for the ſweet ſleepe, and comfortable reſt which thou haſt giuen me this night: and that to the innumerable benefits hitherto powred vpon my ſoule and bodie, thou haſt vouchſafed to preſerue me this night paſt, from ſudden death, and all other euill and miſchiefe, ſpirituall and corporall, that anie perſon, man or woman, hath beene ſtriken withall, by thy permiſſion and ſufferance; knowing of a ſuretie, that the ſelfe-ſame, or ſuch like, had worthilie light on my head alſo, haddeſt not thou defended and preſerued me, and giuen me time to amend my life, ſo that I might liue henceforth, not as I will, but as thou wilt.
                        And now, ſeeing thou, O almightie God, and moſt mercifull father, in the tables of the commandements deliuered to the hands of thy ſeruant Moſes, vpon the mount Sina, among other precepts, diddeſt giue charge vnto thy choſen children of Iſrael, that in ſixe daies they ſhould doo all ſuch works and aaffaires, as they had to doo, and reſt from labour the ſeuenth daie: graunt, I beſeech thee bleſſed father, that ſiuce I haue by thy mercie, happilie paſſed ouer this whole weeke, vnder thy gratious protection, I may not onelie reſt this daie from my dailie trauels, but that I may abſtaine alſo from the works of ſinne and iniquitie, and ſanctifie this daie wholie vnto thee, with praiers and thankes-giuing, abounding in all works of loue and charitie, as thou haſt commanded in thy holie word, that I may be found pure, without ſpot or blemiſh, at that daie, when thy Sonne Ieſus Chriſt ſhall come to iudge the world with righteouſneſſe and equitie.
                        
                           
And foraſmuch as thou haſt ordeined this daie, among the reſt, wherein we ſhould meete all together with brotherlie loue and affection, to yeeld thee praiſes for the innnumerable benefits we haue receiued at thy hand; to acknowledge thy fatherlie loue and pitie towards vs, from time to time; and to giue thee thanks in generall for all and vniuerſall thy benefits hitherto beſtowed vpon vs: I beſeech thee to grant me thy holie ſpirit, that I may be the more zealouſlie inflamed to ſerue thee, in true holineſſe and integritie of life: and by the operation of that ſpirit, I may kill all carnall luſts, vnlawfull pleaſures, concupiſcence, and all other ſpots of vncleanneſſe; whereby I may be made thy child by adoption and grace; and my bodie the temple of the holie Ghoſt, being throughlie purged and purified from the dregs of iniquitie and abhomination. Giue me grace, moſt mercifull Father, to ſpend this daie to thy pleaſure, in all good works of the ſpirit; and charitie, proceeding from an vndefiled faith in Chriſt Ieſu; that I fall not into anie kind of danger: but that all my dooings may be ordered by thy gouernance, to doo alwaies that is righteous in thy ſight, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another Morning praier on the Lords daie.
                        
                        
                           O Almightie and mercifull God, eternall Father; Sonne, and holie Ghoſt; three in perſons, one in ſubſtance, God in verie deede, and from euerlaſting.
                        I extoll thy ſacred Maieſtie; I praiſe thine vnſpeakeable mercie, thy diuine truth I exceedingly commend; for that of thy fatherlie and woonderfull goodneſſe thou haſt protected me this night, vnder the ſhadowe

of thy wings. Yea, thou alſo haſt made me quietlie to take my reſt, notwithſtanding the dangerous ſnares of my deadlie enimie the diuell.
                        Thou art the God, which exalteſt vs from the gates of the ſhadowe of death; and from the power of darkneſſe thou deliuereſt vs.
                        Therefore I will acknowledge thee for thy goodnes, and for the woonderfull things, which thou dooeſt among the ſonnes of men.
                        I will magnifie thee in the great congregation, and among much people will I praiſe thee.
                        My hart is readie, O my God, my hart is readie. I will praiſe thee, O Lord, among the people, and ſing to thee among the nations. For thy mercie is aboue the heauens, and thy truth vnto the clouds.
                        I will not hide thy mercie and truth in the great congregation; bicauſe it is a good thing to praiſe the Lord, and to ſing to thee, O thou moſt high: to declare thy louing kindneſſe in the morning, and thy truth in the night.
                        Bleſſe the Lord, O my ſoule; and all that is within me praiſe his holie name.
                        Which forgiueth all thine iniquities, and healeth all thine infirmities.
                        Which redeemeth thy life from deſtruction, & crowneth thee with mercie and compaſſion.
                        Which ſatiſfieth thy longing with good things, and protecteth thee from thy youth.
                        Which alſo hath kept all my bones this night, not one of them is broken.
                        To the King euerlaſting, immortall, inuiſible, and onlie wiſe God, be honor and glorie for euer and euer, Amen.
                        
                        VNto thee, O Lord, doo I lift vp my ſoule.
                        O God, earlie will I ſeeke thee; my ſoule thirſteth for thee, my fleſh luſteth after thee in a barren and

drie land, where no water is, to ſee thy ſtrength and glorie.
                        O eternall God, which haſt brought me to the beginning of this daie, defend me with thy mightie power, that this daie I fall into no ſinne, nor run into anie kind of danger: but let all my cogitations, words, and works tend to the ſetting foorth of thy righteouſneſſe.
                        Lighten my mind this morning with the ſhining and clearneſſe of thy wiſdome; that in my hart, that true daie-ſtar may riſe and ſhine, as it were a candle in a darke place.
                        Giue me the ſpirit of wiſdome and reuelation in the knowledge of thee; and lighten the eies of mine vnderſtanding, that I may knowe what my hope is, how great the glorie of mine inheritance, and what the excellent greatneſſe of thy power towards me is.
                        Fill me with thy mercie in this morning, ſo ſhall I be glad and reioice all my life long.
                        Mercifull God, endue me with thine holie ſpirit, that I may neither thinke, ſpeake, or doo anie thing this daie, but that which may pleaſe thee, and tend to the aduancement of thy glorie, and health of my ſoule.
                        Gouerne thou mine vnderſtanding and will, and ſo direct all the cogitations of my hart, that I may wholie be thine, and ſauour of nothing beſides thee my God and redeemer.
                        Teach mee the waie of thy commandements, O Lord; and I will keepe it vnto the end.
                        Giue me vnderſtanding to keepe thy lawes, and to loue thee, my Lord and God, with all my hart, with all my ſoule, and with all my ſtrength: and let all thy teſtimonies be my delight, and counſellers.
                        Comfort the ſoule of thy ſeruant; for vnto thee, O Lord, haue I lifted vp my ſoule. For thou, Lord, art good and gentle, and of great kindneſſe to as manie as call vpon thee.
                        
                           
Behold, O God, earlie now this morning I doo offer my ſelfe a morning ſacrifice vnto thee, a troubled ſpirit; a broken, and an humble hart, O Lord, thou wilt not deſpiſe.
                        Make me fit, that I may likewiſe dailie offer vp my bodie a liuing ſacrifice, holie and acceptable vnto thee, which is a reaſonable ſeruice, & gratefull obedience.
                        Both now and euerie daie, Lord, I commend my ſoule and bodie into thy hands; thou haſt redeemed me, O God of truth.
                        Compaſſe me about with the watch of thine Angels, which are miniſtring ſpirits ſent out for their defence, which are the children of ſaluation; that they may pitch their tents about me, and incounter with Satan the dragon, to defend me from euill.
                        Giue thine holie Angels charge of me, that they protect me in all my waies, leaſt happilie I hurt my feete againſt a ſtone: ſo will I praiſe thee, and magnifie thy name, which liueſt and reigneſt a true and eternall God, worlds without end,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another praier verie effectuall to be vſed vpon the Lords Sundaie, or other holie or feſtiuall daies.
                        
                        
                           SEing that the verie ſolemne times & feſtiuall holidaies doo vndoubtedlie greatlie renew the reioicing of the godlie: yea, & that more is, with a certaine heape, as a man would ſaie, doo maruelouſlie augment and increaſe their ſpirituall ioie in thee O moſt holie Lord God of Saboth, and make it greater than it was. For they are kept to continue, and ſtir vs vp vnto the remembrance and recounting of thy woonderfull acts, things, and miracles wrought and done by thine almightie Maieſtie, for the conſeruation, and ſaluation of mankind: and by

that occaſion, doo exceedinglie cheere vp and fill the harts of the godlie with ſpirituall ioies in thee.
                        Moreouer, bicauſe good exerciſes are to be renewed often; but eſpeciallie vpon the Sundaie and holie daies, as though at that time we were departing out of this life, and going to the euerlaſting holie daies of ſpirituall reſt, and continuall ioie; and therefore ought we at that time eſpeciallie to prepare our ſelues with carefulnes; & to ſhew our ſelues more godlie, and to doo thy cōmandements more ſtraightlie, as they yt ſhall receiue reward of our trauels at thy hand ere it be long.
                        Behold, I thy ſillie creature, deſirous to keepe the godlie reſt of the new Saboth, better than hitherto I haue done, (for which, as for all other my defaults I crie thee hartilie mercie) doo now therefore moſt humblie beſeech thee, O holie Father, to powre plentiouſlie vpon me thy bleſſed ſpirit; through whoſe diuine power, vertue and grace, I may this daie be throughlie ſanctified, clenſed, dedicated, and prepared both bodilie and ghoſtlie, perfectlie to ſerue and worſhip thee, according to thy will.
                        O holie God, which haſt commanded vs to ſanctifie our ſelues, and to be holie, as thou art; grant me grace with S. Iohn to be in the ſpirit on the Sundaie: and this daie to be holie with them that be holie, and altogither giuen to ſerue & pleaſe thee in ſpirit and truth, as becommeth the true worſhippers of thee.
                        Make thou me this daie to refraine my ſelfe from dooing anie bodilie labour, or ſeruile worke; and vtterlie to forbeare all maner of vngodlineſſe diſpleaſant vnto thee: as namelie, not to abuſe or miſpend this holie daie in pranking, packing, priinting, pointing, friſling, or vaine attiring of my ſelfe to be gorgious and gaie, and to prance in pride: neither yet in vnlawfull plaies, idle ſports, games, Ethnicall paſtimes, feaſting, banketting, bellie-cheere, gluttonie, riot, exceſſe,

chambering, wantonnes, niceneſſe, contention, pride, couetouſneſſe, or in anie other fleſhlie filthineſſe, and vaine pleaſures of this tranſitorie world; but contrariwiſe, to occupie and giue my ſelfe obedientlie vnto the vertuous works, and holie exerciſes of thy diuine precepts; namelie, vnto the expending of the ſpirituall reſt, and euerlaſting repoſe of all Chriſtian ſoules in heauen, vnto the meditation of thy woonderfull works, and vnſpeakable benefits, which thou, O God, continuallie beſtoweſt vpon thy Church, and to bee thankefull for the ſame: to ſtudie the Scriptures, to heare and reade thy ſacred word, and followe the ſame: to call vpon thee by ardent praier, with hartie thankeſgiuing, for all thy mercies: to exerciſe thy holie Sacraments, and to comfort and giue almes gladlie according to mine abilitie, to the releefe of the poore, and comfort of the needie.
                        Make me (I ſaie) O Lord, with holie Dauid, both moſt willing and glad this daie to go foorth with my whole familie, and the multitude, into thy houſe and temple, in the voice of praiſe and thankes-giuing, among ſuch as keepe it holiedaie vnto thee, and at all ſeaſons by common order appointed, diligentlie to frequent the populous reſort and Chriſtian aſſemblie of the congregation in the Church, and to be preſent with other thy people often in that moſt ſacred place on earth; at the moſt holie, and alwaies to thee, O God, moſt acceptable ſacrifice of praiſe, inuocation, diuine worſhip, giuing of thanks, ſinging of hymnes, hearing of thy word, vſing of thy holie Sacraments, praiers, interceſſions, and ſupplications; which at the comming together of the whole congregation, is vſed ordinarilie to be made vnto thee in the Church, with verie great ceremonie and reuerence: that thus being free from the trauels and drudgerie of this world, and by thy grace cleanſed from all mine owne carnall

affections, and wholie giuen ouer to ſerue and ſanctifie thee in true reſt and ſpirituall eaſe, as alſo to beſtowe, conſecrate, and hallowe this thy ſacred Sabboth or Sundaie, with all other feſtiuall holie daies, moſt glorious vnto thee, in all holie and ſpirituall exerciſes of a faithfull and obedient Chriſtian, according to thy will, I may euen heere in this vale of teares, amidſt all my miſeries, be thereby occaſioned with cheerefull hart, both outwardlie and inwardlie, exceedinglie to reioice and truſt in thee my moſt mercifull God and louing ſauiour, and after this tranſitorie life ended, be worthie, happilie to enter into thy holie Mountaine, the Tabernacle of thine elect, and kingdome of euerlaſting bleſſedneſſe; where the ſoules of all holie folke doo reſt, and there with them to be partaker of perfect holineſſe, and of the vnſpeakable benefit of the wiſhed wealefull reſt, and eternall endleſſe ioie of ioies, in the Paradiſe of God; to ſee, loue, and praiſe thee moſt ioifullie in happie mirth for euer and euer, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord: to whome with thee O Father, and the holie Ghoſt, be immortall glorie, infinite power, euerlaſting kingdome, perpetuall praiſe, and continual thanks-giuing, by all creatures, through all ages & worlds, world without end,
                        Amen.
                        See more for Sundaie afterward.
                     
                     
                        Meditations.
                        HEere call to mind the commandements of almightie God, concerning the kéeping of the Sabboth daie holie vnto him; as namelie, the third commandement, Remember thou keepe holie the Sabboth daie, &c. Exod. 20, verſe 11.
                        Call to mind alſo his promiſes touching the ſame, who ſaith, If thou turne awaie thy foote from the Sabboth, from dooing thy will on the Sabboth daie, and call the Sabboth a delight to conſecrate it as glorious vnto the Lord, and ſhalt honor him, not dooing thine owne waies, nor ſeeking

thine owne will, nor ſpeaking a vaine word, then ſhalt thou delight in the Lord, and I will cauſe thee to mount vpon the high places of the earth, and feede thee with the heritage of Iacob thy father, for the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it. Eſaie 58, verſes 13, 14.
                        
                           Yea, bleſſed is he that keepeth the Sabboth, and polluteth it not, and keepeth his hands from doing anie euill, Eſaie 56, verſe 2. Then his threatenings where he ſaith.
                        
                           Yee ſhall therefore keepe the Sabboth, for it is holie vnto you: he that defileth it, ſhall die the death: therefore whoſoeuer worketh therein, the ſame perſon ſhall be euen cut off from among his people, Exod. 31, verſe 14.

                           AND to the end you may the ſpéedilier addreſſe your ſelfe to frequent the Church often, not alone, but with your whole familie, as you ought; firſt call diligentlie to your mind ſome of theſe ſentences of holie Scripture, following:
                        
                           ¶ Eſaie 66, verſe 23.
                           
                              AND it ſhall come to paſſe, that from Moone to his Moone, from Sabboth to his Sabboth, all fleſh ſhall come to worſhip before me, ſaith the Lord.

                              AND it ſhall come to paſſe in the latter daies, the hill of the Lords houſe ſhall be prepared in the height of the mountaines, and ſhall be higher than the hilles, and all nations ſhall preaſe vnto him, and a multitude of people ſhall go ſpeaking thus one to another; Come, let vs aſcend to the hill of the Lord, &c.
                           
                        
                        
                           ¶ Agge. 1, verſes 4, 5, 6, &c. Zach. 14.
                           
                              THus ſaith the Lord of hoſtes: Conſider your owne waies in your harts, ô yee people: get yee vp to the mountaine and fetch wood, and build this houſe, and I will

take pleaſure in it, and I will be glorified, ſaith the Lord. Is it time for your ſelues to dwell in ſeeled houſes, and this houſe lie waſte? Ye haue ſowne much, but ye bring little in: ye eate, but ye haue not ynough: ye drinke, but ye are not filled: ye cloath you, but ye be not warme: and he that earneth wages, putteth it into a broken bagge: ye looke for much, and lo, it came to little. And when ye brought it home, I did blowe vpon it: and why? ſaith the Lord of hoſts. Becauſe of my houſe that is waſte, and you run euerie one into his owne houſe. Therfore, vpon you is the heauens ſtaied from deaw, and the earth is ſtaied from yeelding her increaſe; and I haue called for a drought vpon the land, and vpon the mountaines, and vpon the corne, and vpon the wine, and vpon the oile, and vpon all that the earth bringeth foorth, vpon men and vpon cattell, and vpon all the labour of thy hands, &c.
                           
                        
                        Thus hauing well peruſed and weied theſe holie ſentences, ſtir vp your ſelfe, and exhort all your children, ſeruants, ſtrangers and neighbours about you, with chéerefull minds, willinglie and diligentlie to reſort to the Church; eſpeciallie euerie Sundaie and Holiedaie, ſaieng vnto them as followeth.
                     
                     
                        An exhortation to be vſed of Maisters and Dames euerie Sundaie morning.
                        
                        
                           COme, let vs aſcend to the hill of the Lord, to the houſe of the God of Iacob; and he will there inſtruct vs of his waies, and teach vs how to walke in his paths. For out of Zion ſhall come a lawe, and the word of the Lord from Ieruſalem, and hee ſhall giue ſentence among the heathen, and ſhall reforme the multitude of the people. Come therfore, I ſaie; let vs cheerfullie aſcend, and go vp to Ieruſalem, the hill and houſe of the Lord. O let vs go our waies into his gates with thanks-giuing,

and into his courts with praiſe; that we may preſent our ſelues to daie holie before the Lord, and ſerue him with gladneſſe.
                     
                     
                        ¶ When you be going towards the Church, the better to expell idle thoughts, and noifull cogitations, and to prepare your harts to deuotion; euen by the waie as ye go, meditate and ſaie with your ſelfe ſome of theſe Pſalmes and praiers following; the which alſo for more readineſſe would be learned by hart, and ſaid without booke.
                        Praiers to be vſed going to Church. A Pſalme.
                        
                        
                           I Was glad when they ſaid vnto me; We will go into the houſe of the Lord; our feete ſhall ſtand in thy gates O Ieruſalem.
                        Ieruſalem is builded as a Citie that is at vnitie in it ſelfe.
                        For thither the Tribes go vp, euen the Tribes of the Lord, to teſtifie vnto Iſrael, and to giue thanks vnto the name of the Lord.
                        For there is the ſeate of iudgement, euen the ſeate of the houſe of Dauid.
                        O my ſoule, praie for the peace of Ieruſalem, they ſhall proſper that loue it.
                        Glorie be to the Father, &c. As it was in the, &c.
                     
                     
                        Another Pſalme.
                        
                           LORD, I haue loued the habitation of thy houſe, and the place where thine honour dwelleth; yea the zeale of thine houſe hath euen eaten me.
                        Therefore will I waſh my hands in innocencie, O Lord; and ſo will I go to thine altar, that I may

ſhew the voice of thankes-giuing, and tell of all thy woonderous works in the great congregation.
                        Behold, I will go with the multitude, that by the motion of the ſpirit are brought forth into thy houſe, O God: euen vpon the multitude of thy mercies, & in thy feare will I (among ſuch as keepe holiedaie) worſhip towards thy holy Temple, & make haſte vnto thy Tabernacle, to vnderſtand thy worthie wais & diuine wil.
                        For vnto thee, O God, which heareſt the praiers; vnto thee ſhall all fleſh come, to worſhip thee in Zion: praier ſhall be made euer vnto thee, and dailie ſhalt thou be praiſed in Ieruſalem.
                        O therefore let the congregation of thy people come about thee, O God; that they may ſhew all thy praiſes within the portes of the daughter of Zion, and reioice in thy ſaluation.
                        Remember alſo, I beſeech thee good Lord, according to the fauour that thou beareſt vnto thy people; and viſit me with thy ſaluation, that I may ſee the felicitie of thy choſen children, and reioice in the gladneſſe of thy people, & giue thee thanks with thine inheritance.
                        O make me one of the houſhold of faith, and congregation of them that ſeeke thee: euen of them that ſeeke thy face, O Iacob, ſaieng; Lo, I come to fulfill thy will O God.
                        O ſend out the light of thy truth, that they may leade me, and bring me vnto thy holie hill, and to thy dwelling; and that I may go vnto the altar of God, euen vnto thee, the God of my ioie and gladneſſe.
                        With ioie and gladneſſe, I ſaie, cauſe thou me to be brought to thy manſion houſe, and to enter into the Kings palace.
                        That I may aſcend vnto the hill of the Lord, and riſe vp holilie in his holie place.
                        That I may receiue the bleſſing from the Lord, and righteouſneſſe from the God of health and ſaluation.
                     
                     
                        
                        Another verie godlie praier, to be vſed going to Church, either at morning, or euening praier.
                        
                        
                           IAm now entred into the voiage of ſaluation; conduct me, O Lord, luckilie vnto the port; that deliuered by thee from the verie death, I may eſcape all dangers, and come to the verie life. Behold Lord, my hart hunteth thee out; and would God I might dailie more and more trace thee out! yea I haue a great while ſore longed, with ſo godlie affection as I could, to celebrate thee in the frequented aſſemblies of the godlie, which trulie I will now doo accordinglie, by the grace and aſſiſtance of thy holie ſpirit; and that with a moſt readie and ioifull mind, as it behooueth. And that this mine enterpriſe and beginning may proceede to a further good ſucceſſe, and amendment of my maners and imbettering of my life; doo thou finiſh the thing, O God, which thou haſt begun in me, and make me continuallie to increaſe from faith to faith. Yea, ſo renew and ſhape me againe in innocencie and righteouſneſſe, O grations Lord, I beſeech thee; that as a perſon new borne of thee, I may inſearch thee againe and againe, both in the dawning of the daie, morning, noone, euening, and night. Now lead me forooard, O Lord, I beſeech thee, in thy righteouſneſſe: let thy louing ſpirit direct my feete, and make thy waies plaine before my face; bicauſe of my mortall and inuiſible enimies. And doo thou vouchſafe luckilie to conduct my bodie this daie, vnto thy materiall temple, and to bring my ſoule at the laſt vnto thy holie hill, and bleſſed mountaine, which thou haſt purchaſed with thy right hand, that I may reſt both bodie and ſoule in heauen, and remaine with thee foreuer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        
                        Or praie thus;
                        
                           O GOD the word, who art the light; by whom light was made: who art the waie, truth, and life; in whom there is no darknes, ouerſight, vanitie, nor death: ſhine foorth, O Lord my light, mine inlightening, and my welfare, whom I will reuerence; my Lord, whom I will honour; my Father, whom I will loue; my Iudge, whom I will feare; my Bridegroome, whom I will cleaue vnto, and keepe my ſelfe an vndefiled ſpouſe. Shine foorth, O euerlaſting light; ſhine foorth, I ſaie, and lighten the Lampe of my virginitie, with the oile of thy diuine grace and mercie; that this blind ſoule of mine, which yet ſitteth in darkneſſe, and ſhadowe of death, may ſee the light, and eſchew darkneſſe; ſee the waie, and eſchew ſtraieng; ſee the truth, and eſchew leaſing; ſee the life, and eſchew death. And guide thou my feete vnto the waie of peace, that by thy mercifull protection, I may ſee the light, walke in the light, and neuer ſtumble vpon the ſnares of Sathan, but may now paſſe thereby, into the palace of thy woonderfull tabernacle, and be able to climbe vp euen vnto the holie houſe and temple, with the voice of gladneſſe and confeſſion, there to abide, and receiue at thy hands both mercie, righteouſneſſe, health, bleſſing, and euerlaſting ſaluation, with my fellowe-citizens, thy Saints and houſhold menie,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        
                        Another godlie praier to be ſaid either going towards, or being in the Church.
                        
                        
                           LOoke what earneſt and feruent deſire ſoeuer the old fathers had, O moſt mightie GOD, to come vnto the place, wherein thou hadſt appointed a tabernacle to thy ſelfe for that time; euen the like am I kindled withall, in beholding the repairing of thy ſacred Church, and to ſee therin a very great companie of godlie men & women lawfullie aſſembled together, for the aduancement of thy glorie; hearing thy holie doctrine, & dulie receiuing of thy bleſſed Sacraments accordinglie. Wherefore, I humblie beſeech thee, which art my God & my King, that I may this daie reioice to be there. For what felicitie ſoeuer may be attained vnto in this fraile life, I doubt not but it will light vpon the ſacred companie of the godlie there aſſembled. Giue eare therefore, O excellent Father, vnto mine earneſt praiers; & grant that I make none other account of thy bleſſed houſe, than thy will and pleaſure is I ſhould doo. For a more bleſſed thing it were for me, to haue one daies meeting and abode therein; than if I abide neuer ſo great a time of continuance in the congregation of the vngodlie; or in ſuch a one as is not lawfullie aſſembled, with the aduantage and ouer-plus of all the pleaſures of this tranſitorie world. Seeing that therefore thou art our moſt ſplendent light, and ſtrong defence; cauſe our aſſemblies on the earth; O God, ſo to redound to thine vnſpeakable glorie, that our aſſured hope, by comming in the end vnto thee in the euerlaſting tabernacles of the heauens, may be augmented, and verie much increaſed, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        
                        VVhen you enter into the Church, meditate thus with your ſelfe, and ſaie:
                        
                        
                           LORD, who ſhall aſcend into thy high hill? Or who ſhall riſe vp in thy holie place?
                        Euen he that hath cleane hands, and a pure hart; and hath not lift vp his mind vnto vanitie, nor ſworne to deceiue his neighbour.
                        He ſhall receiue the bleſſing from the Lord, and righteouſneſſe from the God of his ſaluation.
                        This is the generation of them that ſeeke him; euen of them that ſeeke thy face, O Iacob.
                        Lift vp your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift vp ye euerlaſting doores: and the King of glorie ſhall come in, euen the Lord of hoſts, moſt mightie and ſtrong.
                        Open me the gates of righteouſneſſe, O Lord, that I (with the righteous nation that keepe thy truth) may go into them, and giue thanks vnto thee. This is the gate of the Lord, the righteous ſhall enter into it.
                        Yea, bleſſed are they that doo thy commandements, O God. For their power ſhall be in the tree of life, and they ſhall enter in through the gates, into the holie citie new Ieruſalem.
                        But without ſhall be dogs, and inchanters, and whooremongers, and murderers, and idolaters: yea, there ſhall enter into it none vncleane thing, neither whatſoeuer worketh abhomination, or maketh lies: but they onlie, which are written in the Lambes booke of life,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        
                        Or thus.
                        
                           LOrd, who ſhall enter into thy ſanctuarie, to conſider thy mightie power; except thou open it vnto him? And who ſhall open it, if thou ſhut it? Trulie, O Lord my God, I ſillie worme and claie, am not able to enter into thine euerlaſtingneſſe; vnleſſe thou, which haſt made all things of nothing, doo lead me in. Yea, I knowe, Lord, I knowe and confeſſe, that I am vnwoorthie to enter vnder thy roofe: but yet I beſeech thee, let a bleſſed entrance to the houſe of eternall felicitie, whither I haue dailie a feruent deſire to come, be ſet open, and made as a free paſſage vnto me, O God. And giue mee leaue now, I praie thee, though a dog, and an vnwoorthie wretch, euen for thine owne honour ſake, to enter into thy holie houſe, and to approch thy ſacred preſence, and confound not thy ſeruant that ſeeketh thee, and putteth all hir truſt and confidence in thy mercie.
                        Oh ſuffer me not, I ſaie, good Lord, to knit vp and finiſh my laſt daies with malefactors, and wicked perſons: but grant that after my long and dailie trauell, in this tranſitorie world, I may in the end at length be permitted, through thy mercie, to enter the courts of thy diuine preſence, and with thine elect and choſen ſeruants for euer inhabit the hauen of eternall felicitie, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        
                        Or ſaie thus, as you enter into the Church.
                        
                        
                           O How amiable are thy dwellings, thou LORD of hoſts! My ſoule hath a deſire and longing to enter into the courts of the Lord, my hart and my fleſh reioice in the liuing God.
                        When ſhall I enter in, to behold thy face? When ſhall I come to appeare before thy preſence, O God?
                        For one daie in thy courts, is better than a thouſand elſe where? I had rather be a doore-keeper in the houſe of my God, than to dwell in the tents of the vngodlie.
                        Yea, like as the Hart deſireth the water brookes: ſo longeth my ſoule after thee, O God. My ſoule is a thirſt for God, yea euen for the liuing God.
                        Now therfore I come into thy houſe, O Lord; euen vpon the multitude of thy mercies: and in thy feare doo I enter thy tabernacle, and will worſhip thee: God grant it according to thy will,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        As you paſſe by the people in the Church vnto your Pue, ſalute the congregation, and ſaie:
                        
                        
                           PEace be within thy wals, O Ieruſalem; and plentiouſneſſe within thy palaces. For my brethren and companions ſakes I will praie for thy peace, and wiſh thee now proſperitie: yea bicauſe of the houſe of the Lord our God, I will ſeeke to doo thee good, and ſaie:
                        Bleſſed is he that commeth in the name of the Lord. The Lord proſper you, I wiſh you good lucke in the name of the Lord: So be it.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                        Being placed in your Pue, call to mind theſe ſentences of holie Scripture following.
                        
                        
                           
                              IT is written, My houſe ſhall be called a houſe of praier vnto all nations: but ye haue made it a den of theeues, and an houſe of marchandiſe. Matth. 21, verſe 13.
                        
                           Ye ſhall keepe my Saboths, and feare with reuerence my Sanctuarie. I am the Lord. Leuit. 19, verſe 30.
                        
                           Holineſſe becommeth Gods houſe for euer. Pſ. 93, ver. 5.
                        
                           The Lord will vtterlie deſtroie euerie enimie that doth euill in his Sanctuarie, that prophaneth his holie temple, & polluteth the dwelling place of his name. Pſal. 74, verſe 3.
                        
                           When thou commeſt into the houſe of God therefore keepe thy foote, and drawe nigh, that God which is at hand may heare; that thou giue not the offerings of fooles. For they knowe not but to doo euill. Eccleſ. 4, verſe 17.
                        
                           Be not haſtie with thy mouth, I ſaie, and let not thine hart ſpeake anie thing raſhlie before God. For God is in heauen, and thou vpon earth: therefore let thy words be few. Eccl. 5, verſe 1.
                     
                     
                        A Meditation, wherein is shewed how we ought to be verie intentiue to the Pſalmes and praiers in the Church.
                        
                        
                           WHen thou entreſt the temple to pray or ſing Pſalmes; leaue behind thee the heapes of wauering thoughts, and forget vtterlie the care of outward things, that thou maiſt giue all thine attendance to diuine matters. For it is vnpoſſible for him to ſpeake with God, that talketh with the whole world in ſilence. Intend thou him that intendeth thee; heare him when he ſpeaketh to thee; that he may hearken to thee when thou praieſt to him: ſo ſhalt thou ſhew a carefull and due reuerence in magnifieng

God, and a chriſtian attendance in giuing heed to his holie word.
                        Underſtand not this, as though I performed that I ſpeake of: yet I ſtriue to doo it, repenting the omiſſion of it in time paſt, and ſorowing that I am not able to attaine it preſentlie. But thou, to whom God hath beene more liberall of his graces, inclined his ſacred eares towards thee; with hartie praiers, in ſighs and teares beſeech him moſt humblie, to pardon thee all thy riots, and exceſſe. Extoll and magnifie him in the excellencie of his works with ſpirituall ſongs. For this is moſt pleaſing to the mightie Iehoua, as him ſelfe doth witneſſe: The ſacrifice of praiſe ſhall honour me.
                        O how happie wert thou, if it were granted thee to behold, with ſpirituall eies, the araie of the celeſtiall princes, that go before them that praiſe God in the midſt of the damſels, plaieng with their Timbrels! Thou ſhouldeſt ſee doubtleſſe with what endeuour and cheerefulneſſe they accompanie them in ſinging, aſſiſt them in praier, in meditation comfort them, protect them in time of reſt, direct them in all their affaires and buſineſſe. Uerelie the heauenlie powers doo loue their felowe-citizens, and doo exceedinglie ioie in the ſocietie of thoſe, that are free heires of ſaluation; they with longing looke for our comming, and earneſtlie attend, that the ruines and diſ-peopling of their heauenlie citie may be filled vp againe, in the multitude of our companies. They doo curiouſlie inquire, and willinglie heare all good of vs. They be carefull meſſengers betweene God and vs, and beare a faithfull witneſſe of our dooing. They diſdaine not now to be our ſeruants, that ſhall be our felowes: we haue made them reioice in our conuerſion and repentance. Let vs haſte then to fulfill their ioies ouer vs. Wo be vnto thee then that loueſt a returne to thy

vomit and impuritie. Dooeſt thou thinke to haue thoſe witneſſe for thee in iudgement, whom thou haſt bereaued of ſo great and long hoped-for ioie? They reioiced ouer vs, when we gaue our names firſt to Chriſt; as if they had ſeene vs pulled out of hell gates. But what will they doo then, when they ſhall ſee thoſe turned backe from the gate of Paradiſe, who had alreadie almoſt one foote in heauen?
                        Wherefore, though our bodies be on earth, let vs ſet our harts on the higheſt heauens: let vs run thither, not with bodilie members, but with ſpirituall affections, deſires, and longing; where not the angels onlie, but the Creator of angels doth long looke for vs. God the father looketh for vs, as his owne ſonnes and heires, to commit the rule of all his treaſure vnto vs. God the ſonne looketh for vs, as his deere german brothers, and coparteners, that he may preſent God his father with the fruite of his natiuitie, and price of his owne bloud. The holie Ghoſt alſo looketh for vs: for he verelie is that bountie and benignitie, wherein from euerlaſting we were predeſtinate to ſaluation; and no doubt, he wiſheth our predeſtination accompliſhed.
                        Seeing then the whole court of heauen doth ſo earneſtlie looke and wiſh for vs, let vs with all zealous affection ſeeke after it. For with great ſhame, and a large cōfuſion, ſhall he come thither, that is lead with a cold and luke-warme deſire: but whoſoeuer, in the ſtrength of continuall praier, and dailie meditation, is alwaie conuerſant there; ſhall both from hence depart with ſecuritie, and there be receiued with triumphing ioie.
                        Therefore, whereſoeuer thou be, ſtill praie within thy ſelfe. If thou chance to be far from thy cloſet, ſeeke no place. For thou to thy ſelfe art a place. If thou be in thy bed, praie; and praie often in the temple. And in proſtrating thy bodie, lift vp thy mind to God. For as there is no time, wherein we doo not vſe and enioie the

goodneſſe & mercie of God: ſo there ought to be no moment, wherein his almightineſſe ought not to poſſeſſe our memorie. But thou wilt ſaie, I praie continuallie, and yet I ſee no fruit of my praier: as I come vnto it, ſo I depart; none anſwereth, or ſpeaketh vnto me; nothing is giuen me, but my labour ſeemeth vaine. This is the ſpeech of humane follie, not obſeruing what truth it ſelfe promiſeth, ſaieng: Uerelie I ſaie vnto you, whatſoeuer ye aſke in praier with faith, yee ſhall receiue it; and it ſhall be performed vnto you. Eſteeme not lightlie therfore of praier. For he to whome thou praieſt, hath it in price; and before it proceed from thy mouth, commandeth it to be regiſtred in his owne booke. One of theſe two we may vndoubtedlie hope for; that either he will giue vs our requeſts, or better. Thinke of God as highlie as thou art able, and yet beleeue more of him, than thou canſt thinke. All the time wherein thou thinkeſt not vpon God, eſteeme it loſt; all other things be foraigne vnto vs, time onlie is our owne. Attend therefore vpon God; and whereſoeuer thou art, be all with him. Impart, but giue not vp thy ſelfe to worldlie affaires. Whereſoeuer thou art, caſt thy thoughts vpon God. No place is vnfit for meditation. Therefore, with all cheerefulneſſe, gather vp thy ſpirits, dwell at libertie with thy ſelfe, and out of the largeneſſe of thy heart meaſure out a lodging for thy Lord Chriſt.
                        A wiſe mans mind is alwaie with God. He ought to be alwaies in our ſight, by whome we haue our being, life, and knowledge. He is the author of our being, the teacher of our vnderſtanding, the treaſure of our ſpirituall and ioifull happineſſe. Heerein we may acknowledge the diuine image of the heauenlie Trinitie. For as he hath his being in excellencie of wiſdome and goodneſſe; ſo we, according to our creation, haue our ſubſiſtence; being endued alſo with reaſon, and

delight in knowledge, as a ſignature and impreſſion of the diuine Maieſtie. Eſteeme therefore of thy ſelfe, as of the temple of God; ſeeing it pleaſed him to impart his likeneſſe to thee, as a high renowne, to adore and imitate God. Thou dooeſt imitate him, if thou be holie, as he is holie. For a holie mind is the temple of God; and a ſincere hart, the moſt acceptable aultar. Thou dooeſt adore God, if thou be mercifull, euen as he is mercifull to all. For it is a pleaſing ſacrifice to God, to gratifie all for the cauſe of God.
                        Doo all things as the ſonne of God, that thou bee not vnworthie of him, that hath vouchſafed to be thy father. Knowe that of all thy actions, God is a witneſſe. Beware therefore to fixe thine eie, or ſettle thy thought in anie vnlawfull delight: neither ſpeake, nor doo anie ill, though thou maiſt. Offend not God, neither in deede nor purpoſe. For his almightineſſe diſcouereth thy deeds. Thou haſt neede of a great watch, diſcharging all the actions in the face of the Iudge; yet liue thou maiſt without ſecuritie, if thou behaue thy ſelfe ſo, as he vouchſafe thee his preſence. If he abide not with thee in fauour, he will come vnto thee in reuenge. And if he come in reuenge, wo be vnto thee; nay rather, wo if he come not. For God is moſt angrie with him, whoſe ſinne he leaueth vnpuniſhed. His damnation is prepared, whome God reformeth not in fatherlie chaſticement.
                     
                     
                        Another Meditation to the ſame effect.
                        
                           GOod Lord bee mercifull vnto mee, that offend worſt; where I ought moſt to mind the reformation of my faults. Praieng in the temple, oftentimes I heed not what I ſpeak. I praie, but by the abſence of my wandering mind, it is made fruitleſſe. With my bodie I enter into

thy temple; but my hart ſtandeth without: therefore my praier vaniſheth awaie. For the outward ſound of the voice, without the inward ſymphonie of the hart auaileth nothing. Then is it a great follie, naie madneſſe, when by praier preſuming to ſpeake in preſence of the mightie God, we doo brutiſhlie wander in vaine thoughts, and arreſt our minds vpon verie trifles. An heinous offence alſo, and woorthie a greeuous puniſhment it is, that vile duſt ſhould not vouchſafe audience to the Creator of the whole world ſpeaking vnto him. But the woorthineſſe of thy heauenlie bountie is vnſpeakable, which euerie daie regardeth vs ſtanding in wretchedneſſe and miſerie, turning aſide our eares, and hardening our harts. Yet he crieth out vnto vs, ſaieng: Returne into the waie yee tranſgreſſours; attend, and ſee: for I am God. God ſpeaketh to me in the Pſalme, and I vnto him; yet in repeating the ſame, I regard not whoſe it is. Heerein I offer God great wrong, in deſiring him to harken vnto my praier; which my ſelfe in making it, doo not heare. I requeſt him to attend me, and I neither intend him, nor my ſelfe; but that which worſſe is, I doo violate his ſacred preſence with vnpure and vnprofitable thoughts. Haue mercie vpon me, pardon mine offences, and renew mee with thy holie Spirit; that in all my Praiers, Pſalmes, Songs, and Hymnes, I may both ſaie and ſing to the honor and glorie of thy name,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        ¶ Heere, as time will conuenientlie ſerue, before Common praier begin, make your priuate petitions vnto Almightie God, and ſaie:
                        
                        A ſalutation to God the Father, or first forme of praier, when yee kneele downe in the Church.
                        
                           HAile our Father, GOD Almightie, full of grace, mercie, and comfort. Thy Sonne Ieſus Chriſt, verie God and man, is with thee in heauen. Bleſſed be thy name, O Father, both in heauen aboue, and in earth amongſt all nations, by thine onlie ſonne our Lord,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another first forme of praier in the Church at Morning praier.
                        
                        
                           
                              O
                            Moſt high and bleſſed Trinitie, the verie Father, Sonne, & holie Ghoſt, three glorious and vnſeparable perſons in Trinitie, and but one God in Deitie, vncreate, incomprehenſible, eternall, inuiſible, and almightie, one being power, wiſdome, goodneſſe and Lord, of coequall, coeternall, and vndefiled Maieſtie: who before all worlds, in all worlds, and by all worlds into euerlaſting, dooeſt liue, and dwelleſt alone in vnapprochable light: with all my verie hart and mouth doo I, beeing the leaſt member of thy Church, fall downe lowe on my knees heere before thy footeſtoole; and confeſſe, praiſe, bleſſe, and worſhip thee, O glorious Trinitie. And now and euer, with all Angels, creatures and Elders, both in heauen and earth, I crie and ſaie; Holie, Holie, Holie Lord God of hoſtes, dreadfull, ſtrong, righteous, mercifull, maruellous, praiſe-worthie, to be beloued. Heauen and earth are full of thy glorie. Glorie be to thee, O God, for euer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        
                        A praier, that God would vouchſafe to heare the praiers of the Congregation afflicted, and graunt their requests.
                        
                           OH Lord my God, moſt high; moſt holie holie holie Lord God of Sabaoth, moſt bleſſed and glorious Trinitie, Father, Sonne, and holie Ghoſt, three glorious perſons of coequall and conſubſtantiall Maieſtie, and one almightie and incomprehenſible God in Deitie, alwais, by all meanes, of all creatures, aboue all things to be woorſhipped in Unitie, and glorified in Deitie: looke downe from thy kinglie court and princelie pallace, where thou art placed, in the higheſt coaſts of the heauen of heauens; and ſitteſt in the celeſtiall throne of eternall glorie, betweene the Cherubins and Seraphins. Looke downe, I ſaie, O moſt mightie Iehoua, and haue reſpect now, I beſeech thee, vnto thy ſacred Sanctuarie, and holie houſe of praier. Let thine eies I ſaie, O Lord, be euer open towards thy bleſſed Tabernacle night and daie; euen towards thy Church, thy Temple, and moſt ſacred place on earth; where thine honor dwelleth, and whereof thou haſt ſaid: My houſe ſhall be an houſe of praier for all people and nations, and my name ſhall be called vpon therein, that thou maiſt harken this daie vnto the praiers, which we thy poore creatures, and moſt vnwoorthie ſeruants make before thee in this place.
                        Heare thou therefore, O our God, euen from heauen, the place of thy glorious habitation, the ſupplications of thy ſeruants; and alſo what praiers and ſupplications ſoeuer ſhall be made vnto thee, of anie particular man or woman, and of all the people. Giue good eare (I ſaie) O Lord, vnto all the cries, praiers, and petitions of thy people heere aſſembled, or that

ſhall be gathered together in thy name; who with rent harts, bowed knees, and ſtretched out hands returne vnto thee, and preſent themſelues here this daie, to confeſſe thee, & call vpon thy holie name in this place. And when thou heareſt, pardon the ſinnes of thy ſeruants, and be mercifull vnto the offences and iniquities of thy people, wherewith they haue ſinned and tranſgreſſed, or ſhall offend againſt thy Maieſtie. Heare vs, I ſaie, O Lord, O holie Lord God heare vs; we praie thee be mercifull vnto thine inheritance, and doo and giue to euerie one of vs, according vnto all and euerie thing that we call and praie for vnto thee, this daie, in this thy holie houſe, according to thy will, thorough Ieſus Chriſt our Lord:
                        Amen, Amen.
                     
                     
                        A pſalme of preparation to praier in the morning.
                        
                        I will giue thanks vnto the Lord with my whole hart, ſecretlie among the faithfull, and in the congregation, and will ſaie:
                        
                           
                              O
                            God, my hart is readie; my hart is readie here now now in thy holie houſe, to paie thee my vowes, which I promiſed with my lips, and ſpake with my mouth, when I was in trouble.
                        My voice ſhalt thou heare beetimes, O Lord; earlie in the morning will I direct my praiers vnto thee, & will looke vp.
                        I my ſelfe will awake right earlie, to ſing and giue praiſe vnto thee, with the beſt member that I haue.
                        Unto thee, my God, will I lift vp my hands & hart, in this thy holie habitation, towards the mercie-ſeat of thy holie temple.
                        In the voice of praiſe and thankes-giuing, among ſuch as keepe it holie daie. For this is the daie, which

thou, O Lord, haſt made, I will reioice, & be glad in it.
                        In this daie of thy power will I offer the free-will offerings, with an holie worſhip; and magnifie thee in the congregation of the people.
                        From the ground of my hart will I reioice, and giue thanks vnto thee my God, in the ſeate of the elders, for a remembrance of thy holineſſe.
                        O let my mouth be filled with thy praiſe, that I may ſing of thy glorie and praiſe, now and for euermore.
                        Glorie be to the, &c. As it was in the, &c.
                     
                     
                        A Pſalme to be vſed priuatelie before Euening praier, in the Church.
                        
                        
                           IN the euening and morning, and at noone daie will I praie, and that inſtantlie; & he ſhall heare my voice.
                        My hart is fixed redie, O God, my hart is fixed redie; I will praiſe thee and thy faithfulneſſe yet more & more with the beſt member that I haue: euen with all my hart will I thanke thee, and praiſe thy name for euermore.
                        My lips be faine to ſing vnto thee, and ſo is my ſoule, whom thou haſt deliuered: yea my ſoule ſhall be ſatiſfied with marowe and fatneſſe, when my mouth praiſeth thee with ioifull lips.
                        For it is a good thing to giue thanks vnto the Lord; and to ſing praiſes vnto thy name, O moſt high; to tell of thy louing kindneſſe earlie in the morning, and of thy truth in the euening and night ſeaſon: yea, a ioifull and pleaſant thing it is, to be thankfull vnto thee our God alwaie.
                        Therefore I will ſing ſeuen times a daie, and will praiſe thy mercie late in the euening, bicauſe of thy righteous iudgements.
                        As for me, I will be talking of thy worſhip, thy glorie,

thy praiſe, and woonderous works from time to time. For great art thou, O Lord, and maruelous worthie to be praiſed, and feared aboue all the gods: yea, thou canſt not woorthilie be praiſed; for there is none end of thy greatneſſe nor goodneſſe.
                        Behold now therfore, praiſe the Lord all ye ſeruants of the Lord: ye that by night ſtand in the houſe of the Lord, euen in the middeſt of the courts of the houſe of our God.
                        Lift vp your hands in the ſanctuarie, and praiſe the Lord together with me. For he is good and gratious, and his mercie endureth for euer.
                        Yea let euerie good man and woman ſing of thy praiſe, O God: and ſpeake of thine honour in thy temple, with cheerfull minds, and that without ceaſing for euer, and ſaie:
                        The Lords name be praiſed, from the riſing vp of the ſunne, vnto the going downe of the ſame: bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael from euerlaſting, & worlds without end,
                        Amen.
                        Glorie be to the Father, &c. As it was in the, &c.
                     
                     
                        Another preparation of the hart before euening praier in the Church.
                        
                        
                           LORD behold, mine hart is at this preſent readie to ſing praiſes more and more vnto thee, and againe and againe to render vnto thee woorthie thanks here now in the aſſemblie of Saints. Onelie I deſire thee to hallowe vs from heauen thy dwelling place, & powre downe vpon vs thy holie ſanctifieng ſpirit, which may ſo wholie poſſeſſe our ſoules, and preſerue vs from all euill cogitations, and motions of ſinne and iniquitie, that we may hallowe thy name this euening, and euermore in all

things, flowe in thy word, render the ſacrifice of praiſe and thankes-giuing vnto thee, and worſhip thee onelie in ſpirit and truth, as our God moſt mightie in heauen and earth, our righteous maker, and the worker of all goodneſſe, in all ſuch as beleeue in thee.
                        A cleane hart, O God, make thou in me; reſtore in me a willing and a right ſpirit; denie me not the holie Ghoſt. For of my ſelfe I can performe nothing that is good. Bleſſe me therefore, O benigne Lord, and indue me plentifullie with thy grace; to the intent I may offer the acceptable euening ſacrifice of thankes-giuing, (for nothing elſe verelie requireſt thou) and with glad ſemblance imbrace and celebrate thy righteouſneſſe, eſpied in the releaſing & forgiuing of my ſinnes.
                        Giue mee of thy goodneſſe to this end, that I may continuallie praiſe thy Maieſtie daie and night, with myſticall Pſalmes, & ſpirituall ſongs. Be thou euermore working through thy holie ſpirit in me, (which preſentlie keepeth the godlie reſt of the new Saboth) ſuch things as be allowed and pleaſant vnto thee; leaſt at anie time cleauing to ſuperſtition and hypocriſie, I doo worſhip thee amiſſe: but fill my hart with grace, and ſtuffe it with ſweetneſſe of ſpirit, euen as my bodie is ſtuffed with abundance of meats. Lord rid me out of mine vngodlineſſe, plucke from me mine ignorance of thee, baniſh my ſlothfulneſſe of inſearching thee. Compell my fleſh through thy ſpirit to his bounden dutie and obedience, and bring to paſſe that I may now & alwaies applie my ſelfe wholie, without wearineſſe and drineſſe of mind, vnto the right ſincere worſhipping and ſeruing of thee, here in thy preſence. O Lord, open thou my lips, and then ſhall my mouth extoll thy renowmed name, and publiſh thy praiſe, not with fained lips, but with a full glad hart, luſtie ſtomach, and quicke ſpirit, and ſaie with the congregation: Our Father, &c. As at euening praier in the Church.
                     
                     
                        
                        Another Meditation before Euening praier in the Church.
                        
                        
                           SEing thou haſt beautified all thoſe with a notable promiſe, O moſt mightie God, which are knit together in the honouring of thy bleſſed name; ſo that thou wilt not onlie be preſent with them, but alſo beſtoweſt excellent gifts and benefits vpon theſe men, whoſoeuer they are that excell in ſincere faith, and pure godlineſſe, and haue an exceeding deſire to be often in the bleſſed congregation, in ſo much as there is nothing, which they more couet or deſire, than to appeare diuers times in the daie before thee, in the ſacred aſſemblies: yea it ought to be a moſt pleaſant thing vnto vs, to celebrate thy high praiſes perpetuallie, and ſhew foorth thy maruellous works without ceaſing. For the performance whereof, godlineſſe would require, that wee ſhould not onlie doo the ſame in the daie time, but alſo in the night ſeaſon. We will therefore lift vp pure hands in all places, touching the publiſhing of thy glorious name, and render perpetuall thankes (according to our bounden dutie) for thine vnſpeakable goodneſſe, and louing kindneſſe extended towards vs. But ſeeing that this ought to be done in the moſt ſacred and holie aſſemblies, our earneſt requeſt is, to haue thee preſent heere with vs, and to beſtowe thy plentifull bleſſings vpon thy beloued Iſrael. Firſt deliuer vs, wee humblie beſeech thee, from our heinous faults, enorme ſinnes, and lewd corruptions, wherewith we haue greatlie defiled our ſelues. And then let our weake and feeble harts be ſtrengthned in thy bleſſed waie, and the withered powers of our mind (which are dried vp) watered with the holie Ghoſt; that we

being altogither repaired, and wholie renewed, may continuallie celebrate and praiſe thee, and haue a great deſire to direct our praiers vnto thy mercie-ſeate, with a moſt holie intent, as Chriſtians ought to doo.
                        Cauſe vs now, not conſtrained and brought thereto by compulſion, but of a willing hart, to come before thy preſence; and become true worſhippers of thee: yea and ſuch as doo thinke it a goodlie matter to ſpend, not onlie houres, but daies and nights; yea and all our yeares and life in the ſincere ſeruice, and right worſhipping and honouring of thee, in the ſacred Church. Let nothing be ſo deere and pretious vnto vs, as to continue in the praiſes, and commendations of thy glorious name, from morning to night; praieng both publikelie and priuatelie for all other, as well as for our ſelues. Graunt O excellent father, that we in giuing due thanks for thy benefits, may ioifullie ſing double praiſes to thy glorious name for euermore; that our minds, I ſaie, may dailie more and more bee ſtrengthened, hartilie to confeſſe, couragiouſlie to extoll, and aboue all things to exalt thy wonderfull praiſes vnceſſantlie, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord and Sauiour,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        A Pſalme of exhortation to praier in the morning or euening.
                        
                        
                           
                              O
                            Come, let vs worſhip & fall downe, and kneele before the Lord our maker; and let vs hartilie reioice in the ſtrength of our ſaluation.
                        Let our ſoules reioice, I ſaie, in the mercie of the Lord, and not be aſhamed to publiſh his praiſe. Let vs doo our duties betimes, both earlie and late, and he will giue vs a reward in his due time.
                        
                           
For a good thing it is to giue thanks vnto the Lord, and to tell of his louing kindneſſe earlie in the morning.
                        O come therefore, praiſe the Lord with me, and let vs magnifie his name together.
                        Bring hither the booke, take the Pſalter, and ſing vnto the Lord a new ſong. Let vs ſing praiſes, I ſaie, luſtilie vnto him, with a good courage, and ſhew our ſelues glad in him with Pſalmes; euen now in the time appointed, and vpon our ſolemne feaſt-daie.
                        For great is the Lord, and highlie to be praiſed in the Citie of our God, euen vpon his holie hill of Zion.
                        Glorie be to the, &c. As it was in the, &c.
                     
                     
                        Another Pſalme, exhorting all creatures to praiſe God.
                        
                        
                           
                              O
                            Praiſe the Lord of heauen yee Angels of his, ye Saincts that excell in ſtrength, and fulfill his commandements, yee ſeruants of his that harken to the voice of his words, and doo his pleaſure. Praiſe him in the height ye children of Zion, and be ioifull in your King with glorie.
                        For God is verie greatlie to be feared in the counſell of his Saincts; and to be had in reuerence of all them that are about him.
                        Praiſe him all yee heauens, and ye waters that bee aboue the heauens. O God, the verie heauens ſhall praiſe thy woonderous works; and thy truth in the congregation of the Saincts.
                        Yea, let heauen and earth praiſe thee; the Sea, and all that moueth therein.
                        O ſing vnto the Lord all the whole earth, woorſhip him, and ſtand in awe of his iudgements ye multitude

of Iſles.
                        Praiſe the Lord, O Ieruſalem; praiſe thy God, O Zion.
                        Praiſe the name of the Lord, O yee ſeruants of the Lord; yee that by daie or by night ſtand in the houſe of the Lord, euen in the courts of the houſe of our God.
                        O all yee righteous that loue and ſeeke the Lord, and be true-harted towards him; praiſe his holie name, and magnifie him all yee ſeed of Iſrael that feare and dread his Maieſtie.
                        Praiſe the Lord alſo all ye heathen, and nations of the world; worſhip you him, and glorifie his name. For he is great, paſſing all praiſe.
                        Praiſe the Lord, O ye Kings of the earth; Princes, and all Iudges of the world: yea, worſhip him all yee gods. For he is higher than the heauens, and far exalted aboue all gods.
                        O yee kindreds of the people, aſcribe vnto the Lord the worſhip, power, and honour due vnto his name; bring preſents, and come into his courts with praiſe.
                        Let the people praiſe thee, O God; yea let all the people praiſe thee: both yong men and maids, old men and children; let them all remember thy holie name, and declare thy power from one generation to another, world without end.
                        O ſpeake good of the Lord all yee works of the Lord in all places of his dominion.
                        Let euerie thing that hath breath, praiſe the Lord. For his name onlie is moſt excellent, and his praiſe aboue heauen and earth.
                        Praiſe the Lord, O my ſoule; and all that is within me, praiſe his holie name.
                        My mouth ſhall ſpeake the praiſes of the Lord; and let all fleſh giue thanks vnto his holie name for euer and euer.
                        Glorie be to the father, &c. As it was in the, &c.
                     
                     
                        
                        A Pſalme of Gods preſence in the Church.
                        
                           THE Lord hath choſen Zion to be an habitation for himſelfe, he hath longed for hir; ſaieng:
                        This ſhall be my reſt for euer, here will I dwell. For I haue a delight therein.
                        Behold, the Tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them; and they ſhall be his people, and God himſelfe ſhall be their God with them.
                        The Lord is in his holie Temple, euen among thouſands of thine Angels, as in the holie place of Sinai.
                        Gods ſeate is in heauen, the Lord is in the midſt of the holie place; euen of the Tabernacle of the moſt high.
                        This is Gods hill, euen an high hill, in the which it pleaſeth him to dwell; yea the Lord will abide in it for euer.
                        As the hilles ſtand about Ieruſalem; euen ſo ſtandeth the Lord round about his people, from this time foorth for euermore.
                        Glorie be to the Father, &c. As it was in the, &c.
                     
                     
                        Another Pſalme of the beautie of Gods houſe, and the ſoules delight to be therein.
                        
                        
                           
                              O
                            GOD, wonderfull art thou in thy holie places, euen thou God of Iſrael.
                        It is well ſeene, O God, how thou goeſt: how thou my God and King goeſt in the Sanctuarie.
                        The ſingers go before, the muſicians follow after: in the midſt are the virgins plaieng with the timbrels.
                        
                           
Thou Lord haſt giuen thy word plentiouſlie, and great is the companie of the preachers.
                        The Lord is King, he ſitteth betweene the Cherubins, the Lord is great in Zion, and high aboue all people.
                        Thou, O God, art gone vp on high, thou haſt led captiuitie captiue, and receiued gifts for men: yea euen for thine enimies, that thou, Lord, mighteſt dwell among them.
                        Righteouſneſſe and equitie are the habitation of thy ſeate, mercie and truth ſhall go before thy face.
                        Glorie and worſhip are before thee, power and honour are in thy ſanctuarie.
                        This therefore ſhall be my reſting place; here will I dwell, O Lord: euen in the temple and tabernacle of the mightie God of Iſrael. For I haue a delight therein.
                        Lord, here is verie good being for vs. For ſuch as bee planted in the houſe of the Lord, ſhall flouriſh in the courts of the houſe of our God.
                        They ſhall bring foorth more fruit in their age, and ſhall be fat, and well liking; that they may ſhew how true thou my Lord and ſtrength art, and that there is no vnrighteouſneſſe in thee.
                        Yea, bleſſed is the man, whom thou chooſeſt and receiueſt vnto thee: he ſhall dwell in thy courts, and ſhall be ſatiſfied with the pleaſures of thy houſe, euen of thy holie temple.
                        Bleſſed, I ſaie, are they that dwell in thy houſe; they will be alwaie praiſing thee. For in thy temple doth euerie man ſpeake of thine honour; and that bicauſe holineſſe becommeth thine houſe, O God, for euer.
                        This therefore ſhall be my reſting place, euen here in thy temple will I dwell. For it is a good thing for me to be here continuallie in thy tabernacle, before thee my God for euer.
                        
                           
Yea, here doo I wait for thy mercie and louing kindneſſe, O God; euen in the mids of thy temple. O when wilt thou come vnto mee! that I may walke in thy houſe with a perfect hart, and praiſe thy name for euer,
                        Amen.
                        Glorie be to the Father, &c. As it was in the, &c.
                     
                     
                        A pſalme for the proſperitie of the Church, and that all people may praiſe and bleſſe the Lord.
                        
                        
                           REturne, O Lord, to thy many thouſands of Iſrael. Ariſe now, I ſaie, to come into thy reſting place, thou and the arke of thy ſtrength, when the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms alſo to ſerue the Lord.
                        O thou ſhepheard of Iſrael, thou that ſitteſt vpon the Cherubins, be fauourable and gratious vnto Zion: build it vp, and let thy glorie and worſhip appeere therein, throughout all generations.
                        Decke hir prieſts with health, and hir Saints ſhall reioice and ſing.
                        Let the prieſts be clothed with the white reines of righteouſneſſe, and let thy Saints ſing Pſalmes with ioifulneſſe.
                        Giue vs thy word ſtill plentiouſlie, and let the companie of the godlie preachers be great.
                        Let none touch thine annointed ones, nor doo thy prophets anie harme.
                        O Lord ſaue thy people, and giue thy bleſſing vnto thine inheritance: feed them, and ſet them vp for euer.
                        Let the congregation of the people come about thee, O God; that they may offer the ſacrifice of righteouſneſſe, and ſhew foorth thy praiſes within the ports of the daughter of Zion.
                        In this daie of thy power let the people make their

humble ſupplication before thee, and offer the free-will offrings with an holie worſhip.
                        In the Temple let euerie man ſpeake of thine honor, & euerie good man ſing of thy praiſe without ceaſing.
                        O let the nations reioice and be glad: let the people praiſe thee, O God; yea let all the people praiſe thee, and all creatures both in heauen and earth bleſſe thee, and ſaie:
                        Bleſſed be thou, O Lord God of our fathers. For thou art praiſe and honor-worthie; yea and to be magnified for euermore.
                        Bleſſed be the holie name of thy glorie. For it is worthie to be praiſed and magnified in all worlds.
                        Bleſſed be thou, O God, in the holie Temple of thy glorie. For aboue all things thou art to be praiſed, yea and more than worthie to be magnified for euer.
                        Bleſſed be thou in the throne of thy kingdome. For aboue all thou art worthie to be praiſed, and well ſpoken of, and to be more than magnified for euer.
                        Bleſſed be thou that ſitteſt vpon the Cherubims, & lookeſt through the deepe. For thou art worthie to bee praiſed, and aboue all to be magnified for euer.
                        Bleſſed be thou in the firmament of heauen. For thou art praiſe and honor-worthie for euer.
                        Bleſſed be the Lord God, euen the God of Iſrael, which onlie doth woonderous things: and bleſſed bee the name of his Maieſtie for euer, and the earth ſhall be filled with thy Maieſtie: Amen, Amen.
                        
                        Bleſſed be the name of the Lord, from this time foorth for euermore.
                        Bleſſed, I ſaie, be the Lord God of Iſrael, from euerlaſting, and worlds without end: and let all the people ſaie Amen, Amen.
                        
                        Bleſſing, and glorie, and wiſdome, and thanks, and honour, and power, and might be vnto our God for euermore:
                        Amen, Amen, Amen.
                     
                     
                        
                        A praier to be vſed at your first comming into the Church, for a pure and cleane ſoule.
                        
                        
                           SEeing that by the good motion and happie conduction of thy holy ſpirit, O gratious God, I am now entred into this thy holy houſe the Church, and moſt ſacred place on earth, to worſhip thee; and foraſmuch as holines apperteineth to thee, O Lord; for thou art holie, and nothing vnholie may appeare before thee: graunt that both now at this preſent, and ſo oft heereafter as I ſhall enter into this holie place and Tabernacle of the congregation, and appeare before thee; I may be throughlie ſanctified, both bodilie and ghoſtlie, by the diuine graces of thy ſpirit, the better therein to ſerue and worſhip thee. The which thing that I may euen now this daie, the better accompliſh and doo, according to thy will (as I hartilie deſire) and to the glorie of thy name, and the full diſcharge of my chriſtian dutie: I moſt entirelie beſeech thy Maieſtie, firſt to ſanctifie, purifie, cleanſe, make happie, and keepe holie my wretched ſoule and ſinfull bodie; the poſts whereof, deere father, are ſprinkled with the pretious bloud of thy deere Sonne, who moſt deerelie bought them. O comfortable gheſt of the ſoule, leaue not our houſes deſolate; ceaſe not to fill vs by thy continuall preſence, with thy life and righteouſneſſe. Dreſſe, cleanſe, and ſweepe the foreletten cottage once againe I ſaie, good Lord, with the beeſome of thy celeſtiall grace, and heauenlie felicitie, from all the pollution and filth of ſinne and wickedneſſe. Once againe, O Chriſt, vouchſafe to caſt out of the houſe of my ſoule, that vncleane ſpirit, and foule feend Sathan, mine old gheſt and enimie, with the finger of God; and when he is caſt out of me,

giue me grace to watch ſtill continuallie, by hartie and earneſt praier, that he enter not againe into me. For being once mine old gheſt, he knoweth euerie hole and corner of my houſe. Therefore grant me grace to watch continuallie, I ſaie, O Lord, by feruent praier, and vertuous works proceeding from a firme faith; leaſt he returne into the houſe, from whence hee was caſt out, and finding it emptie, ſwept, and garniſhed, he go and take vnto himſelfe ſeuen other foule ſpirits, worſſe than himſelfe, and they enter in alſo, and dwell there with him, and ſo mine end be woorſſe than my beginning; which God forbid. Oh ſuffer not the holie houſe, Lord, of thy Diuinitie, and Temple of the holie Ghoſt, my bodie and ſoule I meane, cleanſed with thy bloud, and decked with thy righteouſneſſe, to bee by my mortall enimies defiled, ſpoiled, or made a cage of vncleane birds, a dungeon of diuels, a den of theeues, a hell of wicked ſpirits, and a ſinke of ſinne, through delectation in ſinne, and infidelitie. Withdrawe not thy hand from me: let me not returne vnto my vomit like the dog: let not mine end be worſe than my beginning, as hapned to Caine, Saule, Iudas, Arius, and manie mo. But as by thy great mercie, my body and ſoule are made the temple & tabernacle of ye holie ſpirit: ſo by the ſame thy rich mercie, & infinite goodnes, grant that the ſame may now become thy holie habitation, & ſacred ſeate of euerlaſting glorie; and ſo be purified, cleanſed, throughlie ſanctified, and made cleane by thy diuine inſpiration, and gratious preſence: that no heapes of ſoile, dregs of duſt, or remnants of filth be to be found in any priuie or ſecret corner of this thy ſpiritual temple, to offend ye celeſtiall eies of thy diuine maieſtie, ſo ſhall thy holie Hall, which is my clenſed ſoule, in all reuerence, deuotion, & godlie worſhip, this daie and euer reſound in the Church, & all places of thy dominion, with thy perpetuall praiſes, to thine eternall glorie,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        
                        Another praier to ſerue God ſincerelie in the Church.
                        
                        
                           
                              O
                            LORD God our celeſtiall Father, whoſe fidelitie and truth is ſtabliſhed in the high heauens, among thy choſen beleeuers, who alſo art woonderfull in the congregation of the faithfull, and moſt mightie, of all power, and preſent euerie-where, beholding all things done in all places on earth. Foraſmuch as thou, O gratious God, haſt choſen this houſe, that thy name might be called vpon therein, and that it ſhould be an houſe of praier and petition for thy people; mercifullie promiſing therewithall, that whereſoeuer two or three be gathered together in thy name, there thou wouldeſt be in the middeſt of them, and whatſoeuer they (beleeuing) aſked of thee, it ſhould be done vnto them. Behold, we therefore, whome by thy grace thou haſt elected to be thy people and heritage, and with whome thou haſt made an eternall couenant and promiſe to helpe, heare, aſſiſt and confirme in all goodneſſe, righteouſneſſe, and holineſſe; doo heere now at this preſent, through the motion of thy good ſpirit, aſſemble and gather our ſelues together in thy name, with one accord, to make our common ſupplications vnto thee: and according to our bounden dutie, with one mind and mouth, in ſpirit and truth, to laud and magnifie thy holie name and maieſtie. Humblie beſeeching thee, O Lord, to haue mercie vpon vs, miſerable ſinners, to purge vs and iuſtifie vs through faith, from all our offences old and new: to inflame and lighten the lamps of our harts with the oile of ſanctification, which is thy holie ſpirit: and ſo there-through to ſanctifie our ſoules, to prepare our harts, and diſpoſe all our members

wholie to true pietie, godlineſſe and deuotion; that we may be woorthie continuallie to lift vp in this holie place of thy glorious preſence, and diuine habitation, pure harts, innocent hands, and moſt feruent praiers vnto thee in heauen.
                        Grant alſo, O gratious God, that we with one hart and voice, in all holineſſe and godlineſſe, trembling, dread, Chriſtian reuerence, humble obedience, ſpirituall worſhip, and diuine ſeruice, may inceſſantlie giue all honour and glorie vnto thee, and for euer to celebrate thy moſt holie name and Maieſtie, in this thy holie temple, as it apperteineth: euen by offering vp dutifullie vnto thy diuine Maieſtie, the moſt ſweet and acceptable ſacrifice of broken and contrite harts, of zealous and true repentance, of humble and vnfeined confeſſion, of pure and inceſſant praier, and of moſt woorthie and condigne lauds and praiſes: that ſo wee may continue bleſſed in thy holie mountaine for euer, and in the end, according to thy faithfull promiſe, obtaine euerlaſting life, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        How the ſoule should rightlie worship and praiſe the Lord in all places.
                        
                        
                           
                              O
                            GOD, the true and the ſouereigne life; of whom, & in whom all things doo liue, whatſoeuer things doo liue trulie, and in happie ſtate. O God, euen goodneſſe and goodlineſſe, from whom, through whom, & in whom are all good & goodlie things, which art good and goodlie. God, whoſe faith quickeneth, hope erecteth, and loue linketh vs. God, who haſt commanded vs to praie vnto thee, and makeſt thy ſelfe to be found, and openeſt to him which knocketh. God, whom none ſeeketh, but the admoniſhed;

and no man findeth, but the purged. God, whom to knowe is life; whom to ſerue, is to reigne; & whom to loue, is the ſaluation and ioie of the ſoule. Thee, both with my lips, and with mine hart, and with all my ſtrength I doo praiſe, bleſſe and worſhip. To thy clemencie and goodneſſe I doo yeeld humble thanks, for all thy benefits; and to thy Maieſtie doo I ſing, holie, holie, holie.
                        O bleſſed Trinitie, I beſeech thee, vouchſafe to come vnto me, and to make me a meet temple for thine holineſſe. I doo praie the Father, through the Sonne; I praie the Sonne, through the Father; I praie the holie Spirit, by the Father and the Sonne; that all wickedneſſe may be ſet far awaie from me, and that all the holie vertues may be implanted within me.
                        O infinite God, of whom, through whom, and in whom are all things made, both viſible, and inuiſible; which incloſeſt thine outward works, and filleſt thine inward; gouerneſt them aboue, and beareſt them belowe; keepe me the worke of thine hands, which truſt in thee, and hope onlie in thy mercie. Keepe me, I beſeech thee, both here and euerie-where; now and alwaie; within and without; before and behind; aboue and beneath; round about: ſo that there be no place for the ſnares of the enimie againſt me.
                        Thou art God almightie, keeper and protector of all that truſt in thee; without whom none is in ſafetie, no man is free from danger. Thou art God, and beſide thee there is none other, either in heauen aboue, or in earth belowe; which dooſt great things, and vnſearchable, and maruellous things without number. Meete it is therefore that thou be praiſed, that thou be honored, that thou be magnified with commendations.
                        To thee, the whole troupe of Angels; to thee the heauens and the powers doo ſing, and continuallie yeeld praiſes, as creatures to their Creator; ſeruants

to their Lord, ſouldiers to their King. Euerie creature doth extoll, and euerie ſoule doth glorifie thee the holie and vndefiled Trinitie. To thee the holie and humble men of hart, to thee the ſpirits and ſoules of the righteous, to thee doo all the ſupernall citizens, together with all the orders of bleſſed ſpirits yeeld humble praiſe and glorie, and exalt thee aboue all things for euer. O Lord, gloriouſlie and honourablie doo thoſe heauenlie citizens adorne thee with praiſes. Man alſo, the moſt excellent among thy creatures, doth magnifie thee: yea, and I too, a miſerable ſinner, doo exceedinglie deſire to praiſe thee; and greatlie doo I loue to loue thee aboue all things.
                        O my God, my life, my ſtrength, and my praiſe; giue me grace to praiſe thee. Put thy light in my hart, and thy word into my mouth; that both my hart may thinke vpon thy glorie, and my tongue ſing and ſpeake out thy praiſes euerie daie. But for as much as praiſe is not ſeemelie in the mouth of a ſinner, and I am a woman of polluted lips; purge mine hart, I beſeech thee, from all iniquitie; ſanctifie me both within and without, O almightie ſanctifier, and make me worthie to ſound foorth thy praiſe. Receiue in good part, from the hand of the hart, and from the loue of the mind; receiue, I praie thee, the ſacrifice of my lips; and let it be acceptable in thy ſight, and aſcend vp vnto thee, like a ſweete ſmelling ſauour,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another.
                        
                           MY ſoule praiſe thou the Lord; and all that is within me praiſe his holie name. My ſoule praiſe thou the Lord, and forget not all his benefits. Praiſe the Lord all yee his works, in all places of his dominion. My ſoule praiſe thou the Lord. Praiſe we the Lord, whom Angels

praiſe, dominions adore, powers doo reuerence, to whom the Cherubins and Seraphins continuallie doo crie, Holie, holie, holie. Ioine we therefore our voices to the voices of the holie Angels; and according to our abilitie, let vs praiſe the God which we both haue. For they, whoſe eies euermore be fixed vpon the Lord, whom they behold not through a glaſſe darklie, but face vnto face, they doo moſt purelie, and without ceaſing praiſe the Lord.
                        O Lord, that immortall people of thine Angels doo praiſe thee; and the celeſtiall powers doo magnifie thy name, who haue no need either to read this our ſcripture, or to ſeeke after the knowledge of thee the holie and glorious Trinitie. For they alwaies behold thy face, where they read without ſyllables of time, what thine eternall pleaſure is, they read, they chooſe, and they loue, yea alwaies they read, and what they read they forget not. By chooſing, and louing, they read this conſtancie of thy counſell; and their booke ſhall at no time be ſhut and folded, bicauſe thy ſelfe art, and wilt euerlaſtinglie be this to them.
                        O much bleſſed are thoſe heauenlie powers, that can religiouſlie and purelie, with an exceeding delight, and vnſpeakable ioie, magnifie thee with praiſes. Thence they praiſe, whence they reioice; forſomuch as alwaies they behold that, which offereth them continuall occaſion, both to praiſe and reioice. But we, preſſed downe with the weight of fleſh, and placed far awaie from thy countenance, in this exile, and diſtracted through varieties of the world, we (alas) are not able woorthilie to praiſe thee, through faith. We praiſe thee not of perfect knowledge, but theſe angelicall ſpirits praiſe thee of knowledge, not through faith. For our fleſh is the cauſe why we praiſe thee, otherwiſe than they doo. Notwithſtanding, albeit we ſing praiſes to thee after diuers ſorts, yet thou art but one God, Creator of all

things, to whom is offered the ſacrifice of praiſe, both in heauen and in earth. But one daie we ſhall come vnto their companie, with whom alwaies we ſhall ſee thee, and praiſe thee without ceaſing.
                        Now then, O Lord, grant that whiles I doo liue in this fraile bodie, both mine hart and my tongue, and all my bones may glorifie thee, and ſaie: Lord, who is like vnto thee? Let thine holie memorie, and thy bleſſed ſweetneſſe poſſeſſe my whole ſoule, and rauiſh me with deſire of inuiſible things. Let my ſoule, I beſeech thee, paſſe from viſible vnto inuiſible, from terreſtriall vnto heauenlie, from tranſitorie things vnto eternall; let it paſſe, I ſaie, and ſee thy woonderfull viſion. Thou art God almightie, three in perſons, yet but one in the ſubſtance of the Godhead, whom we ſerue and worſhip: namelie, the Father vnbegotten, the Sonne onlie begotten of the Father, the holie Spirit both proceeding from and remaining in them both, an holie & glorious Trinitie, one God almightie; which when we were not, didſt mightilie make vs: and when thorough our owne default we were loſt, mercifullie and maruellouſlie hadſt deliuered vs.
                        Oh ſuffer vs not to prooue either vngratefull for ſo great benefits, or vnwoorthie ſo manifold mercies. Unto thee doo I praie, ſue, and beſeech; increaſe my faith, increaſe my hope, yea and increaſe my loue alſo. Through the ſame thy goodneſſe make vs to be euermore ſtable in faith, and fruitfull in all good works, that by a right faith, and works agreeable vnto faith, we may come through thy mercie vnto euerlaſting life, where ſeeing thy perfect and full glorie, euen as it is, we may worſhip thy Maieſtie; and being made woorthie to behold thy glorie, may ſing:
                        Glorie to the Father, who hath made vs.
                        Glorie to the Sonne, who hath redeemed vs.
                        Glorie to the holie Ghoſt, that hath ſanctified vs.
                        
                           
Glorie to the ſouereigne and bleſſed Trinitie, whoſe works are vnſeparable, and whoſe kingdome hath none end. Unto thee belongeth all praiſe, all commendation, all honour, bleſſing and loue. Glorie, power, and might be vnto thee, our God, for euermore,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another praier verie forceable to mooue the mind vnto the praiſes of God.
                        
                        
                           O Ieſus, who art our redemption, our loue, and deſire; GOD of God, helpe me thy ſeruant. Upon thee doo I call, vnto thee doo I crie from the verie bottome of mine hart: for thee doo I call into my ſoule, O enter thereinto, and ioine it to thee, that thou maiſt poſſeſſe the ſame without ſpot or wrinkle. For a moſt cleane Lord muſt haue a cleane habitation. O then ſanctifie me thy veſſell, which thou haſt made; purge me from all wickedneſſe, fill me with thy grace, and being repleniſhed, keepe me ſo, that I may be a meete temple for thy dwelling, both here and foreuer.
                        O moſt good, moſt gratious, louing, deere, mightie, deſired, pretious, amiable, and glorious God, thou art to me ſweeter than honie, whiter than milke or ſnowe, more pleaſant than Nectar, more pretious than gold and iewels, and deerer than all the wealth and promotions of the world. What doo I ſaie, O my God, mine onlie hope, and ſo infinite mercie? What doo I ſaie, O happie and quiet ſweetneſſe? What doo I ſaie, when I ſaie theſe things? I ſaie what I am able, but I ſaie not all that I ſhould. Would to God I could ſaie as the melodious quiers of Angels doo ſaie!
                        O how willinglie would I powre out my ſelfe wholie in thy praiſes! How deuoutlie without ceaſing would I ſing foorth thoſe Pſalmes of heauenlie muſicke,

vnto the laud and praiſe of thy name, in the middeſt of the congregation! Notwithſtanding, becauſe I cannot doo ſo, ſhall I be ſtill? Wo to them which talke not of thee, who openeſt the mouth of the dumbe, and makeſt the tongues of babes eloquent. Wo to them which talke not of thee; for they which babble much, are dumbe when they ſing not thy praiſes. Who can praiſe thee woorthilie ynough, O vnutterable power, and wiſedome of the father! And albeit I cannot find words, wherewithall I maie ſufficientlie expreſſe the almightie and all-ſkilfull word, yet vntill thou call me vnto thee, where I may praiſe thee as I ſhould, and ought; I will ſaie what I am able. Wherefore, mine humble requeſt is, that thou wouldeſt reſpect, not that which I now doo ſaie, but that which I deſire to ſaie. For indeed I doo mightilie deſire to ſpeake of thee, as I ought, and as becommeth me, bicauſe to thee praiſe, to thee Pſalmes, to thee honor and glorie is due.
                     
                     
                        A complaint that we be not moued nor pricked in our contemplations and praiers, like as the Angels be, which tremble at the ſight of GOD.
                        
                        
                           PArdon mee, O LORD, pardon mee, mercifullie forgiue mee, and haue mercie vpon mee: ſpare mine ignorance, and my great vnperfectneſſe: doo not reprooue me as a raſh woman, bicauſe I dare be ſo bold, which am but thy ſeruant. But would to God I were either a good ſeruant, or none vnprofitable or euill ſeruant! And therefore am I an euill woman, becauſe I praiſe, bleſſe and worſhip thee, not as I ought to doo, which art our God almightie, terrible and verie much to be feared: I worſhip thee, I ſaie, without contrition of

hart, and without a well of teares. For if ſo be that the Angels, when they worſhip and praiſe thee, doo tremble, beeing fulfilled with maruellous gladneſſe: I which am a ſinner, whiles I ſtand before thee, ſaieng praiſes, and offering ſacrifice, why am I not affraid in my hart? why am I not pale in my countenance? why doo not my lips quake, and tremble? why is not all my bodie afraid? and why doo I not mourne and bewaile before thee, after ſuch a ſort, that teares might ſpring out of mine eies? I would faine, but I am not able, bicauſe I cannot doo that which I deſire to doo. This maketh mee trulie woonderfullie to maruell, that I am no more mooued, when I ſee with the eies of my faith, thee which art ſo fearefull.
                        But who can doo anie thing without the helpe of thy grace? Except thou make our ſtonie harts to relent, we of our ſelues are not able to mollifie them. For all our helth dependeth vpon thy great mercie. O wretch that I am! How is my ſoule made without anie feeling or perceiuerance; that it is not afraid with ouermuch feare, whiles it ſtandeth before God, and ſingeth to him his owne praiſes? Alas, how is my hart ſo hardned, that mine eies doo not guſh out great flouds of teares without ceaſſing; when I, which am but a ſeruant or bondwoman, doo commune, & talke in my Lord & maiſters preſence? Yea a woman with God, a creature with a Creator. I that am made of the ſlime of the earth, doo ſpeake with him that made all things of nothing.
                        Put me before thee, O Lord; and whatſoeuer I perceiue of my ſelfe, in the ſecrets of my hart, I doo not keepe it cloſe from thy gratious eares. Thou art rich in mercie, and liberall in rewards. Giue me of thy goods, that with them I may ſerue thee. For with nothing elſe can we ſerue or pleaſe thee, but with thine owne gifts, which thou haſt vouchſafed to beſtowe

vpon vs. Faſten, I beſeech thee, thy feare in my fleſh. Let my hart reioice and be glad to feare thy name. Would God my ſinfull ſoule feared thee ſo much, as that holie man, the which ſaid: I alwaies feared God, as though it were great ſwelling flouds ſhould come and tumble vpon me.
                        O God the giuer of all good things, giue me among thy praiſes, a well of teares, with the pureneſſe of hart and reioicing of mind; that I louing thee perfectlie, and worthilie praiſing thee, may feele, taſte, and fauour, in the palate of my hart, how ſweete and pleaſant thou art, O Lord, as it is written: Doo ye taſte and ſee how ſweet and delectable the Lord is. Bleſſed is the man that putteth his truſt in him. Bleſſed is that people which knoweth glad and ioifull praiſing. Bleſſed is the man whoſe ſtrength is in thee, in whoſe hart are thy waies, which going through the vale of miſerie, vſeth it for a well. Bleſſed are the cleane in hart, bicauſe they ſhall ſee God. Bleſſed are they that dwell in the houſe of the Lord, they ſhall praiſe thee world without end,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        A verie deuout praier for grace to praiſe God, and to be thankfull for his benefits.
                        
                        
                           
                              O
                            LORD Ieſus Chriſt, which art the word of the father, which cameſt into this world to ſaue ſinners: I beſeech thee, by the moſt louing bowels of thy mercy, to amend and repaire my life. Make better my deeds, take thou the ordering of my manners. Take from mee that that noieth & hurteth me, and diſpleaſeth thee: and giue me that which thou knoweſt will pleaſe thee, and profit me. Who can make cleane that which is conceiued of an vncleane ſeed, but thou alone? Thou art

the God almightie, of infinite pietie; which dooeſt iuſtifie and make righteous, euen thoſe that are wicked men; and raiſeſt againe to life them that were dead in ſinne; thou changeſt ſinners, and they are, while they liue here, no deadlie or damnable ſinners.
                        Take awaie therefore from me whatſoeuer is in me that pleaſeth not thee. For thine eies doo ſee much vnperfectneſſe in me. Laie the hand, I beſeech thee, of thy pitie, on me, & whatſoeuer offendeth the eies of thy pietie, remoue it from me. In thy ſight is both my health & my diſeaſe: the one I beſeech thee to preſerue, the other to cure. Doo thou heale me, O Lord, and I ſhall be healed: do thou make me ſafe, & I ſhall be ſaued. Thou, I meane, which dooeſt make whole them that be diſeaſed, and dooeſt preſerue them that be cured; which onlie with a becke dooeſt reſtore and repaire things that be decaied, and fallen into ruine. For if thou wilt vouchſafe to ſowe anie good ſeed in the feeld of my hart, of neceſſitie thou muſt plucke vp firſt, with the hand of thy pittie, the thornes of vices which be in it.
                        O moſt gratious, moſt gentle, moſt louing, deſired, amiable, and louelie of all others; powre in my hart, I beſeech thee, ſo great plentie of delectation in thee, that I may deſire no earthlie or carnall thing, nor yet thinke vpon them; but that I may loue thee alone, that I may haue thee onlie in my hart, & in my mouth. Write with thy finger in my breſt, the delectable remembrance of thy ſweet name, and ſo, that it may not be blotted out with anie forgetfulneſſe. Write thy will in the tables of mine hart, and alſo thy iuſtifications; that I may alwaies, and in euerie place haue thee, O Lord, before mine eies, and in my ſight.
                        Inflame my mind with that fire, which thou diddeſt ſend into the earth, and willedſt it to be kindled, that I might offer vnto thee dailie, with teares, a ſacrifice of a troubled ſpirit, and a repentant hart. O ſweet

Chriſt, O good Ieſu, euen according vnto my deſire, and euen as I hartilie require thee with my whole mind, giue me thy holie and chaſt loue, which may repleniſh and keepe me, and alſo fullie poſſeſſe me. Giue me an euident ſigne and token of thy loue, euen a flowing well of teares, which will continuallie runne, that thoſe teares may ſomewhat teſtifie thy loue in me; that they may ſhew foorth, and declare how much my ſoule loueth thee, whiles for the great delectation it hath in the ſweetnes of thy loue, it may not refraine from ſhedding teares.
                        O good Lord, I call to my remembrance ſometimes that vertuous woman Hanna, which came to the Tabernacle to praie, that God would ſend hir a ſonne; of whom the ſcripture maketh mention, that hir countenance, after hir teares and praiers, was not againe changed, or altered. But when I thinke vpon ſo great vertue, conſtancie, and ſtedfaſtneſſe of that woman, I doo bluſh, and am vexed, with ſorrowe, and confounded with ſhame; bicauſe I a wretch, doo perceiue my ſelfe to be fallen ouermuch from thee. For if that good woman did weepe, after ſuch a ſort, and continued ſo in weeping, which did ſearch for nothing elſe but a ſonne, how ought my ſinfull ſoule to mourne, and to perſiſt and abide in weeping, that ſeeketh and looueth God, and hath a deſire to come vnto him? How ought ſuch a ſoule to mourne and weepe, which ſeeketh God daie and night, which will loue nothing but Chriſt? My teares now trulie ſhould be made meate vnto me daie and night.
                        Looke vpon me therefore, O Lord, and take pittie on me; bicauſe the dolours and ſorrowes of my hart are manie in number. Giue me thy heauenlie conſolation, and doo not deſpiſe nor caſt awaie a ſinfull ſoule, for the which thou didſt die. Giue me inward teares, I beſeech thee, from the bottome of my hart, which may waſh awaie

the ſpots of my ſinnes. Repleniſh my ſoule alwaies with heauenlie delectation and myrth, that I may obteine ſome little portion or part in thy kingdome; although not amongſt the perfect men, whoſe ſteps I cannot followe, yet at the leaſt among the religious women and inferiour ſort.
                        And heere now the maruellous deuotion of another woman, called Marie Magdalen, commeth into my mind, which with vertuous loue, and godlie affection, did ſeeke thee lieng in the ſepulchre; which, when thy Diſciples went awaie, and departed from thee, did remaine with thee hir ſelfe; which ſate there ſad and ſorowfull, weeping long and verie much; and when ſhe did ariſe, ſhe ſearched with a diligent eie, and with manie teares the corners of the ſepulchre, which was left emptie, if ſhe might eſpie thee out in anie place, whom ſhe with a feruent deſire ſought. Yea and moreouer, ſhe went againe and againe to the ſepulchre, but that was not inough vnto hir, neither did it ſatiſfie hir deſire. For the grace of a good worke, is to perſeuere and continue in the ſame. And bicauſe ſhe did loue more than other, and that in louing ſhe wept, and in weeping ſhe ſearched, and in ſearching ſhe continued: therfore was it thy pleaſure, that ſhe ſhould firſt find thee, ſee thee, and talke with thee before all other. And not onelie this, but alſo ſhee was a tidings-bearer of thy glorious reſurrection, vnto thy Diſciples, when thou didſt command and bid hir, ſaieng: Go, and tell my brethren, that they go vnto Galilie; there they ſhall ſee me, &c.
                        Seeing therfore that that deuout woman did weepe after ſuch a ſort, and continued in weeping, which did ſeeke thee that waſt aliue among the dead, and touched thee with the hand of hir faith; how ought a ſoule to mourne and to continue in mourning, which beleeueth in thee, & with hir mouth doth acknowledge thee,

to be hir redeemer, that ſitteſt now in heauen, and reigneſt euerie where? How much therefore ought ſuch a ſoule to mourne and weepe, which loueth thee with all hir hart, and with hir whole deſire dooth couet to ſee thee?
                        Oh onlie refuge, the onlie hope of wretches; vnto whom no man or woman needeth at anie time to praie, without hope of mercie: grant vnto me this grace, for thy ſake, and for thy holie name ſake, that as oft as I thinke vpon thee, as oft as I ſpeake of thee, write of thee, read of thee, confer of thee; as oft as euer I remember thee, ſtand before thee, offer vp praiſes, praiers, and ſacrifice vnto thee; ſo oft I may weepe abundantlie with teares in thy ſight, ſo that my teares may be to me in ſtead of bread daie and night.
                        Thou trulie, O King of glorie, and maiſter of all vertues, haſt taught vs with thy word, and with thine example, to mourne and weepe, whereas thou ſaieſt: Bleſſed be they that mourne, for they ſhall be comforted. Thou didſt weepe for thy frend Lazarus that was dead: and didſt let teares fall downe plentiouſlie for the Citie, which ſhould periſh. I beſeech thee, O good Ieſu, by thoſe moſt pretious teares, and by all thy mercies and pities, wherewith thou didſt vouchſafe maruellouſlie to helpe and ſuccour vs that were loſt, giue me the grace to weepe, and to be earneſtlie repentant for my ſinnes; which grace my ſoule deſireth and coueteth verie much: and except it come of thy gift, I cannot haue it, but by the holie Ghoſt, which dooth mollifie the hard harts of ſinners, and prouoketh them to weeping.
                        Giue me the grace of teares, like as thou gaueſt to our forefathers and mothers, whoſe examples wee ought to followe; that I may bewaile my ſelfe in all my life, like as they did bewaile themſelues daie and night. Giue me the deaw of thy grace from aboue, and

alſo a deaw of teares beeneth: that my teares may be vnto me in ſtead of bread daie and night: and that I may be made in thy ſight, O Lord my God, by the fire of thy prouocation, a fat & acceptable ſacrifice. Make me to be mortified and killed vpon the altar of mine hart, and that I may be receiued of thee, as a fat and a ſweet ſmelling ſacrifice. Giue vnto me, O good Lord, a plentifull, flowing, and cleere well of teares, in the which I may waſh continuallie this fowle and ſpotted ſacrifice. For although I haue offered vp my ſelfe wholie vnto thee, by the helpe of thy grace: yet neuertheleſſe, in manie things I offend thee dailie, bicauſe of my great fragilitie and weakeneſſe.
                        Giue me therefore the grace of teares, and continuall repentance, O bleſſed God: and moſt eſpeciallie through the great ſweetneſſe of thy loue, and the remembrance of thy mercies, prepare this table for thy ſeruant, in thy ſight; and giue me power, that as oft as I liſt I may be ſatiſfied of it. Grant vnto me for thy goodneſſe and pittie, that this thy cup, repleniſhed and filled full, may ſatiſfie my thriſt, that my ſpirit may couet thee, and that my mind may burne in thy loue, forgetting all vanitie and miſerie.
                        Heare, O my God; heare, O light of mine eies, thou that art the ſtirrer vp and quickener of my dull eares, heare what I deſire and aſke: and giue me grace to aſke that which thou heareſt. O pittifull Lord, which art woont to be eaſilie intreated, be not hard to be intreated of me, bicauſe of my ſinnes, but for thy goodneſſe receiue the praiers of thy ſeruant, and grant me the effect of my petition and deſire,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        
                        A godlie and diuine Meditation of the ioies of the celeſtiall para diſe, to be vſed at conuenient times in the church, that is, either before, or after publike ſeruice: for to that all men preſent ought to be attentiue.
                        
                        
                           O My ſoule, let vs returne to the heauenlie citie, wherin we be regiſtred, & made free citizens. For like as we be fellowe-citizens of the Saints, and houſhold-meanie of God; and like as we be the heires of God, and coheires with Chriſt: ſo let vs a little conſider the happie roialtie of our citie, ſo far foorth as it is poſſible for vs to conſider it. Let vs ſaie with the Prophet, O how glorious things are ſpoken of thee thou citie of God! For thou art the dwelling place of all them that reioice, the ioie of the whole earth is founded vpon thee. There is not in thee anie age, nor miſerie of age: there is not in thee anie maimed perſon, anie lame man, anie crooke backe, nor anie miſhapen bodie. For all be growne vp to perfect men, after the full meaſure of the age of Chriſt.
                        What bleſſeder thing can there be, than ſuch a life; where there is no feare of pouertie, nor weakeneſſe of diſeaſes? No man is harmed there, no man is diſpleaſed there, no man enuieth there. There is no burning of couetouſneſſe, no deſire of meate, no ambitious ſuing for honour and authoritie. There is no dread of diuell, no ſnares of feends, no feare of hell fire. There is no death, neither of bodie nor of ſoule: but pleaſant life aſſured of immortalitie. Then ſhall there be no miſeries, then ſhall there be no debates: but all things ſhall be at agreemeut, bicauſe all the Saints ſhall agree in one. Peace and mirth hold all things togither, all things are there calme and quiet.
                        There the ſeuen lamps of Gods ſpirits are ſtill burning, before the throne of God: and there is continuall

light, not ſuch as is now heere, but ſo much the brighter, as it is much happier. For as we read, that citie ſhall need no ſunne, nor moone, nor light artificiall, becauſe the Lord almightie ſhall ſhine in it; and the Lambe, as a lampe, ſhall be the light of it; where the Saints and wiſe Uirgins ſhall ſhine as the ſtars, for euer without end: and ſuch as haue taught manie in the waie of righteouſneſſe, ſhall be as the brightneſſe of the ſkie. Where there ſhall be no night, no darkeneſſe, no meeting of clouds, no painfulneſſe of heate or cold: but there ſhall be ſuch a temperatneſſe as neuer eie hath ſeene, eare heard, nor hart of anie man conceiued. There ſhall be no companie, ſauing onlie of them that are accounted woorthie to enioie the ſame, whoſe names are written in the booke of life.
                        But yet it is far aboue all theſe things, to be in fellowſhip with the companies of Angels, Archangels, and all the heauenlie Powers, to behold the Patriarchs and Prophets, to ſee the Euangeliſts and Apoſtles, to woonder at the hoſts of Martyrs and Confeſſors, to view the companies of Uirgins, and to ſee all the Saints; yea and alſo to ſee our owne parents and kindred. Glorious are theſe things, O my ſoule; but much more glorious is it to behold the preſent countetenance of God.
                        O happie pleſantneſſe; O pleſant happineſſe, to ſee the Saints, to be with the Saints, and to be a Saint! Yea, a paſſing excellent glorie ſhall it be, when we ſhall ſee God in himſelfe; and when we ſhall both ſee, and haue him in our ſelues for euer and euer, of whom we ſhall neuer haue ſeene ynough.
                        O my ſoule, let vs thinke vpon this, I ſaie, with a diligent mind; let vs long after this with our whole hart, let vs ſigh hartilie, deſire earneſtlie, and wiſh continuallie, that we may ſoone come vnto them, vnto that citie aboue, whereof ſo glorious things are ſpoken,

and wherein is the habitation of all that reioice,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another diuine Meditation, of the happineſſe of the ſoules that are with God, eſpeciallie to be vſed, when you haue ſung a Pſalme, after a funerall Sermon.
                        
                        
                           HAppie is the ſoule, which being let looſe from the earthlie priſon, flieth vp freelie into heauen, and there beholdeth thee hir moſt ſweete Lord face to face, and is no more diſquieted with anie feare of death, but reioiceth in the euerlaſtingneſſe of incorruptible glorie. For it is ſafe and out of perill, and hencefoorth feareth neither enimie nor death. It poſſeſſeth thee hir mercifull Lord, whom ſhe hath long ſought, and euer loued. And accompanieng hir ſelfe with the quiers of Pſalme-ſingers, ſhe ſingeth continuallie the ſugred ſongs of euerlaſting mirth, to the glorie of thee, O King Chriſt, O gratious Ieſu. For ſhe is, as it were, made drunken with the bountifulneſſe of thy houſe, and thou makeſt hir to drinke of the ſtreame of thy pleaſures.
                        Happie is the fellowſhip of the heauenlie citizens, and glorious is the ſolemnitie of all them that returne from the ſorrowfull trauell of this our pilgrimage, to the pleaſantnes of beautie, to the beautie of all brightneſſe, and to the flower of all excellencie; where thy citizens behold thee continuallie, O Lord. Nothing that may trouble the mind is offered there to the eare. What ſongs, what inſtruments, what Carols, what melodie, what muſicke ſoundeth there without end? There ſound alwaies moſt pleaſant tunes of Hymnes and Pſalmes, moſt ſweet melodie of Angels, and moſt woonderfull ditties of ſongs; which are ſung to thy glorie, by the celeſtiall inhabitants, with heauenlie

harmonie.
                        No harſhneſſe, no gallie bitterneſſe, nor iangling diſcords haue anie roome within thy realme. For there is neither naughtie perſon, nor naughtineſſe. There is none aduerſarie, nor impugner, neither is there any inticement of ſinne. There is no needineſſe, no ſhame, no bralling, no miſ-vſage, no excuſing, no feare, no vnquietneſſe, no penaltie, no doubtfulneſſe, no violence, no diſcord or contention. But there is perfect peace full of loue, continuall reioicing and praiſing of God, careleſſe reſt without end, and euerlaſting gladneſſe in the holie Ghoſt.
                        O how luckie ſhould I ſillie wretch be, if I might heare the moſt pleaſant Pſalmes, Hymnes, and Carols of thy citizens, and their ſugred ſongs, aduancing the praiſes of the ſouereigne Trinitie with due honour: but ouer happie ſhould I be, might I once attaine to ſing a ſong my ſelfe, I ſaie, to ſing one of the ſweet ſongs of Zion, to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.
                     
                     
                        Another longing after the ioies of heauenlie Zion.
                        
                        
                           O Lightſome and glorions houſe of God, I haue loued thy goodlineſſe, and the place where the glorie of the Lord God, who both enioieth and hath created thee, doth dwell. In mine exile I ſigh after thee both night and daie, mine hart longeth; my mind coueteth, and my ſoule deſireth to come vnto the ſocietie of your happineſſe.
                        My praier vnto him which made me, is, that he would poſſeſſe me in thee; bicauſe he hath made both me and you. For I deſire your holie fellowſhip, and woonderfull glorie; not for anie merit of mine owne; but I truſt to attaine therevnto, through the price of

his bloud; namelie of Ieſus Chriſt, whereby we be redeemed.
                        I confeſſe, I haue gone aſtraie like a loſt ſheepe, and haue too long dwelled out of my natiue ſoile, and am far awaie caſt from the face of the Lord my God, into this blindneſſe of baniſhment, who driuen out of the ioies of paradiſe, I bewaile with my ſelfe dailie the miſerie of my captiuitie; and ſing a wofull ſong with great lamentation, when I remember thee, O mother Ieruſalem, while my feete doo but ſtand in thy courts, O ſacred and comlie Zion; and I am not able plainlie to looke into thine inner places.
                        Notwithſtanding, I haue good hope, vpon the ſhoulders of my good ſhepheard, thy Creator, to be brought back vnto thee, that I may triumph againe with that vnſpeakable ioie, where withall they be cheered, which dwell with thee before God his Maieſtie, and our Sauiour Chriſt, which hath abrogated, through his fleſh, the hatred; and pacified all things, both which are in heauen, and which are in earth, by his bloud. For he is our peace, which made of both one, and ioining the two contrarie wals together, hath promiſed that he will giue the euerlaſting felicitie of your happineſſe in himſelfe, after the like maner and meaſure, when he ſaid: They ſhall be like the Angels of God in heauen.
                     
                     
                        Another longing or deſire of the ſoule after the ſupernall Ieruſalem.
                        
                        
                           O Mother Ieruſalem, the holie citie of God, and the deerly beloued ſpouſe of Chriſt; after thee dooth mine hart couet, and my ſoule exceedingly is in loue with thy beautie. Oh how comlie, how glorious, how honourable art thou! Thou art all faire, & there is no ſpot in thee. Triumph and reioice,

O beautifull daughters of the Princes. For the King hath a pleaſure in thy faireneſſe, and loueth thy goodlie perſonage. O thou fairer than the children of men! But what is my beloued, O thou faireſt among women, of the welbeloued? My welbeloued is white and ruddie, the chiefe of ten thouſand. Like as the apple trees of the foreſt; ſo is my welbeloued among the ſonnes of men. Under his ſhadowe had I delight. Lo now I ſit, and his fruit is ſweet vnto my mouth. My welbeloued put in his hand by the hole of the doore, and mine hart was affectioned towards him. In my bed by night I ſought him that my ſoule loued; I ſought, and I found him. I hold, and will not let him go, vntill he bring me into my mothers houſe, into the chamber of hir that conceiued me. For there thou wilt giue mee thy teates moſt abundantlie, and perfectlie; and wilt ſatiſfie mine hart with a maruelous ſatietie, ſo that I ſhall neither hunger nor thirſt anie more.
                        Oh happie ſhall my ſoule be, yea happie and alwaies happie ſhall I be; could I once get to behold thy glorie, thine happineſſe, thy beautie, thy gates, thy wals, thy ſtreets, thy manifold manſions, thy noble citizens, and thy mightie King in his Maieſtie. For thy wals are of pretious ſtones, thy gates of the richeſt pearls, and thy ſtreets of the pure gold; wherein is ſoong the ioifull Halleluiah without intermiſſion. Thy manifold buildings are founded vpon ſquared ſtones, builded vpon Saphyres, incloſed with golden wals; whereinto none ſhall enter, but the cleane; neither ſhall anie vncleane perſon inhabit it. Beautifull art thou become, O mother Ieruſalem, and ſweete in thy comforts. No ſuch thing is in thee, as we ſuffer in this world, and as we behold in this wretched life. There is neither darknes nor night, nor anie change of times in thee. There ſhineth not in thee either the light of the lampe, or the brightneſſe of the moone, or the glittering

of the ſtarres: but the God of God, light of light, euen the ſunne of righteouſneſſe euermore doth enlighten thee. The white and vnſpotted lambe is thy pure and cleare light, thy ſunne, the cleereneſſe, and euerlaſting contemplation of this moſt glorious king is all thine happineſſe.
                        He is the King of kings in the middeſt of thee, and you are his miniſters about him. There be the ſinging quires of Angels, there be the companies of ſupernall citizens, there the ſolemnitie of all, which haue returned from this wofull peregrination vnto thy ioies. There be the prudent Prophets, the twelue Apoſtles, the victorious hoſt of infinite Martyrs, and the ſacred conuent of holie Confeſſors is there. There be both vpright men, and holie virgins, which haue ouercome the pleaſures of this world, and the weakeneſſe of ſexe. There be thoſe yoong men and maidens, old men & matrons, which haue ſpent their time in godlie conuerſation. There be the ſheepe & lambs that haue eſcaped the ſnares of this world, where they now triumph in their ſeuerall manſions. The glorie of each particular man differeth; but common is the ioie of them all. There full and perfect charitie doth reigne. For God there is all in all, whome they doo alwaies behold, and by beholding him, continuallie they burne the more in loue towards him. They loue, and they praiſe him; they praiſe, and they loue him: all their worke is to praiſe God without ending, without fainting, without toiling. O happie, yea and euermore happie ſhall I be, if after the reſolution of this mortall bodie, I may heare thoſe celeſtiall ſongs of melodie, which are ſung vnto the praiſe of the eternall King by thoſe citizens of the ſupernall countrie, and by the companies of the bleſſed ſpirits! Happie then, yea much happie ſhould I be, might I be counted woorthie to ſing thoſe ſugred ſongs, and to wait on my

King, my God, and my Captaine, to behold him in his glorie, according as he hath promiſed, ſaieng: Father, I will that they, whome thou haſt giuen me, be with me, euen where I am; that they may behold my glorie, which I had with thee before the foundation of the world. And in another place. If anie man ſerue me, let him followe me. For where I am, there ſhall alſo my ſeruant be. And againe, He that loueth me, ſhall be loued of my father, and I will loue him, and will ſhew mine owne ſelfe vnto him.
                     
                     
                        Another godlie and Christian praier for the Church and congregation preſentlie aſſembled.
                        
                        
                           ALthough the holie Scriptures doo teach vs euerie where, that the heauen, O moſt good and mercifull God, is thy dwelling place; yet the ſame doth in ſuch wiſe ſet out thine infinite goodneſſe, as the Church is both called, and alſo is in deede, thy ſanctified houſe, wherein thou moſt frequenteſt; wherein alſo thy bleſſed name is lifted vp with high praiſes, the faithfull inſtructed in thy ſacred words, and the holie Sacraments dulie receiued. And therefore the godlie, hauing an eſpeciall regard to the honour of thy glorious name, moſt earneſtlie, with a feruent mind, and vehement affection, doo continuallie ſtir vp one another, to make holie aſſemblies, with woonderfull exhortations; to the intent the pure worſhipping, and holie inuocating of thy bleſſed name, might onlie be therein practiſed. Now therefore, and at what time ſo euer we ſhall come together in the holie congregation, our earneſt requeſt is, that wee may be there with cheerefull and verie deſirous minds. For thou trulie haſt, of an exceeding liberalitie, adorned thy holie Church with moſt flouriſhing & right excellent gifts; neither is there anie thing pretermitted, that

apperteineth to hir garniſhing, which may either belong to the ſpirituall decking and beautifieng thereof, or to the plentious enriching of it, in abundance of all heauenlie good things. Which ſeeing they haue proceeded moſt fullie from thee; this onlie remaineth, that thou wouldeſt be preſent with vs and them, which are aſſembled together in the name of Ieſus Chriſt; and ſo condeſcend vnto our feruent praiers, who thereby doo call vpon thee, as the members thereof may be annexed together with a perpetuall concord. Cauſe all our meetings (I ſaie) good father, to be in ſuch ſort, as we may render due honour vnto thee. Let the ſacred Scriptures be heere purelie and ſincerelie interpreted, and let thy glorious kingdome from daie to daie be more and more inlarged, making all theſe things to be eſtabliſhed with thy ioious peace, and the tranquillitie of thy holie ſpirit, yea ſo long as we praie for the quietneſſe and felicitie heereof. Let vs procure ſubſtantiall and perfect good things, both to our neighbours, and alſo vnto thy bleſſed houſe, and holie ſanctified Church. And cauſe that thoſe Citizens, which doo credit the ſacred doctrine of thy holie Church, may by thy excellent benefit become frends and faithfull brethren one to another; and in the end beeing quite deliuered from thrall, bring thou to paſſe that one daie we may altogether repoſe our ſelues in the true and moſt holie Ieruſalem; through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another praier for the increaſe of the Church.
                        
                           THE Church is vnto thee, O moſt good and mercifull GOD, as a moſt roiall Queene eſpouſed; to the intent ſhe may bring foorth vnto thee a moſt plentifull and holie ſeede. Wherefore, foraſmuch as thou haſt coupled hir vnto thee, to be thy wife by faith; and that ſhe is reputed of the vngodlie as a barren woman, becauſe ſhee ſeemeth to

haue left off child-bearing: grant hir to be made vnto thee, through thy ſacred word, and holie ſpirit, afruitfull and ioifull mother of manie holie and vertuous children, by whome thy glorious name may be exalted with perpetuall praiſes, in thine holie houſe, euen as it becommeth them. Let hir be glad with a perfect and ſubſtantiall ioy, for the great number of hir moſt faithfull & religious ſonnes and daughters. Multiplie & increaſe the iſſue of thy ſacred Church (I ſaie) O God, with a plentifull and an innumerable iſſue; and let hir ingender godlie children vnto thee dailie more and more, euen ſuch as are worthie of ſuch a father & mother, and to be partakers of thy bleſſed ſpirit. Grant that we may altogether aſpire vnto the loue of thee, our moſt delectable bridegroome, and that throughour labour laid together, in ſtead of our forefathers, who are now alreadie gathered vnto thee, manie mo faithfull, religious, and holie children may be begotten vnto thee anew, with whom we may alwaies, in our poſterities, ſet out & celebrate thy famous honour, & moſt noble praiſes. Shine thou downe out of Zion, O God, euen from thine exceeding high & vnapprochable light, vpon the virgin thy bleſſed Church; & preſerue hir from the number of perils, which ſhe is in cōtinuall danger of. Let hir not fall to ruine, nor be as a lampe deſpiſed in the opinion of the rich & welthie men of this world; but let thy mountaines gliſter, and giue their light as lamps of fire. Yea let righteouſnes & ſaluation breake forth out of zion, as a ſhining light and burning lamp; that all men may ſee it, and glorifie thee. Let the lamps of hir loue, I ſaie, O God, be as coales of fire, and a verie vehement flame of the Lord, to dazell, ouercome, and conſume hir enimies after a woonderfull and miraculous manner; and cauſe the ſeuen lampes of the Uirgins, euen all thy ſpirituall gifts and graces O GOD, in the Saincts to burne bright and cleere,

without anie quenching before thy throne for euer.
                        Let thy Church be as a flouriſhing Uine, ſpreading it ſelfe far abroade; ſo that Antichriſt, with all his craft and induſtrie, may not be of force to cut and hew it downe. And euen as thou, O Lord, haſt euerie where maruellouſlie repleniſhed the earth with thine ineſtimable goodneſſe, ſo in like manner, be ſo good, as to let the number of thy true and faithfull ſuppliants, bee dailie more and more greatlie enlarged. Let there bee continuall labouring in thy beloued Church, by doctrine and example, to nurture the bleſſed children, ſo that their works may be a ſingular ornament thereof, to thy glorie, and the increaſe of all manner of vertue. Let hir (I ſaie) be made dailie like vnto a moſt fruitefull woman, that may be compared to the ranke Oliues, and exceeding fertile Uines: and grant, that a continuall ofſpring of thy deere children, may be multiplied in thy bleſſed Church, and become notable in peace, in praiſes, and in puritie of life and doctrine, to the renowmed honour of thy glorious name, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another praier for the preſeruation of the Church.
                        
                        
                           O Celeſtiall God, and Father of infinite mercie and compaſſion, which not onelie gathereſt to thy ſelfe an holie Church in this world, out of mankind, through the operation of the holie Ghoſt, and preaching of thy word; but alſo preſerueſt the ſame being gathered, and adorneſt it with all kind of temporall things, and which more is, with eternall bliſſe: we humblie beſeech thee, gratious Lord, that of thy goodneſſe, thou wouldeſt vouchſafe euermore to mainteine this thy little flocke, embracing,

preaching, and profeſſing thy word, through thine eſpeciall grace. Continue thy fauour toward the ſame, keepe it in ſound doctrine, conſtant in confeſſing, in the lawfull vſe of thy holie Sacraments, and in pureneſſe of life; that neither the gates of hell, the rage of Sathan, nor yet the rigorouſneſſe and tyrannie of this world oppreſſe the ſame. Protect and keepe this thy boate and little barke, toſſed among manie perillous tempeſts, and miſerable ſurges, in the raging ſea of this trouble ſome world, that it periſh not being ouerwhelmed. Uphold thy Church, which is builded vpon a ſure rocke, and dependeth vpon Chriſt a ſound and vnmoueable foundation.
                        O Lord of hoſtes, returne; looke downe from heauen, and behold; viſit thy Uine, and make it perfect, which thy right hand hath planted, and thou haſt choſen to thy ſelfe. Hedge the ſame about with thy ſtrong defence, that the branches thereof being ſpread out and pruned, may bring foorth aboundance of fruite. Raiſe vp thy power, come, O God, and ſaue vs. Conuert vs, ſhewe foorth thy countenance, and we ſhall be ſaued. Encreaſe thy ſheepe within thy hardels, ſo ſhall we be quiet from all inuaſion and ſcatterings, neither can anie drawe vs by force out of thy hands. Defend vs from ſuch as ſeeke the vtter ouerthrowe of pure religion, and in place thereof labour to bring in the ſhamefull inſtauration of blaſphemous idolatrie. Suffer not thy word, that moſt cleere and vnchangeable light to be corrupted, or put out by our meanes: but gather to thy ſelfe, through the ſound of the Goſpell, ſuch a Church, as may harken vnto thee, honour and ſanctifie thy name, as well in word, as in honeſt conuerſation, that ſo thou maiſt haue a righteous and holie generation, celebrating thy goodneſſe for euermore. O ioine vs vnto that companie, which doth worſhip thee continuallie, that we may be citizens of

thy kingdome among thy Saincts.
                        Grant that we erre not frō the foundation of wholſome doctrine, anſwering to the rules of the ſacred Scripture; and that we offend not againſt our conſcience: but ſeparate vs from the companie of the vngodlie ones, and from the damned crue of the reprobate. Let vs not ſo much as take their names into our mouths, which powre out heapes of blaſphemies to thy great diſhonour, and defacing of thy truth; vnto whom thy ſonne is a deſtruction and ſtone of offence. For they deſpiſe his baſe eſtate, and the fooliſh preaching of thy Goſpell; and the deformed ſhew of the Church, placed in the midſt of all kind of miſeries, they loath and abhor; preferring vncertaine riches, lordlie authoritie, and the vaine pleaſures of this tranſitorie world, before the profeſſion of the truth; & ſo making warre with thy ſonne, they doo purchaſe euerlaſting deſtruction vnto themſelues.
                        Keepe vs euermore, that wee may abide in that Church, which is trulie Catholike, conſiſting of members of manie nations; but linked vnto thee in one and the ſame confeſſion. Sanctifie vs with thine holie ſpirit, that our ſinnes being forgiuen vs, wee may take another trade of life, in acknowledging thee to be the onlie true God, and Ieſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent. Giue vnto thy Church reſting places, and neſts, where they may ſound thy ſacred Goſpell purelie, without corruption. Suppreſſe the diuell, which ſpredeth blaſphemies againſt thy doctrine; that ſo neither feined gods may be erected, nor ſuperſtitious inuocations confirmed, nor thy glorie defaced. Weaken the power of thine enimies, which boile in hatred againſt thy truth, and conſpire the death of thine elect: ſo neither ſhall ſtables of woolues be made, nor dennes of theeues eſtabliſhed.
                        O Lord returne and quicken vs; ſo ſhall thy people

reioice in thee. Let all ſuch as truſt in thee reioice and triumph for euer. Dwell thou in them, and let thoſe which loue thy name, reioice in thee. O Lord remember not our offences. Thou which waſt ſomtime mercifull, and forgaueſt the wickedneſſe of thy people, and hidſt all their ſinnes; which withdrawedſt all thine anger, and turnedſt from the fierceneſſe of thine indignation; be mindfull of thy woonted mercie, and receiue vs into thy fauour. For we depend vpon thee alone, being deſtitute of all worldlie aid; our truſt wholie is in thee, and all our confidence reſteth in thy ſtretched-out arme. O Lord, couer vs with thy grace, as it were with a ſhield, that ſo we may be bleſſed; and abiding in the houſe of thy congregation, may acknowledge and call vpon thee, according to thy word reuealed, and praiſe thee euermore, through our Lord Ieſus Chriſt,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        A praier for vnitie in faith and religion.
                        
                        
                           O Eternall God, and moſt mercifull Father, which haſt called vs to the vnitie of the true Catholike faith, and gathered vs by thy word into the lap of the Chriſtian congregation, that wee may be all of vs one bodie, and one ſpirit; euen as wee are called in one hope of our calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptiſme, one God, and Father of all, which is aboue all, and through all, and in vs all. For euen as thou, O Father, art in thy ſonne, and he in thee; ſo ſhould we alſo be one in thee our God. And therefore we crie vnto thee, O almightie Father, and eternall God; teach vs thy waies, that we may walke in thy truth. O knit our harts vnto thee, that we may feare thy name. Grant that all the faithfull

may be like affected, and of one mind as thou art, thinking the ſame thing after the enſample of Chriſt our Sauiour; and that as well in minds, as with mouth, we may agree among our ſelues, both in true doctrine, and in outward behauiour of conuerſation. For the ſcope of the Churches felicitie conſiſteth in the vnitie of true faith and religion.
                        Keepe vs in the true vnderſtanding, and right knowledge of thy ſacred Scriptures; that without ſtrife and contention, we may ſpeake one thing. Let there be no diſſentions nor ſchiſmes among vs. Let nothing be done through contention, or of vaine glorie: but let vs be one bodie, indued with one mind and iudgment, according to thy word reuealed; vntill we attaine to the vnitie of faith, and knowledge of thy ſonne, into a perfect man, according to the meaſure of the age of the fulneſſe of Chriſt, which is the head; by whom the whole bodie being coupled and knit together, by euerie ioint, for the furniture thereof, according to the effectuall power, which is in the meaſure of euerie part, receiueth increaſe of the bodie, vnto the edifieng of it ſelfe in loue.
                        O moſt holie Father, keepe vs by thy name, that wee may be one in thee; and that among vs, which are beleeuers, there may be one hart and one mind. O Chriſt our onlie Sauiour and Mediatour, which before thy paſſion didſt praie, that we might be one in thee, euen as thou art in thy Father: grant that thy Church may be at concord, and agree in one true faith and confeſſion. Let there continue among vs a godlie counſell, let there be one agreement in faith, one mind in praier; that we may growe vp in thee, and that all our harts may be coupled togither by the bond of the ſpirit, vſing thy gifts as they ſhould be, to the aduancement of thy glorie, and to the common profit both of thy Church and Common-weale; and walking woorthie our calling,

wherevnto we are called, with all humilitie and gentleneſſe, with all lenitie, forbearing one another, through charitie, being carefull to keepe the vnitie of the ſpirit in the bond of peace.
                        Repreſſe the furiouſneſſe of Satan, which ſoweth diſſention among thy flocke, to weaken our faith, and to hinder our praiers, whereby thy glorie is defaced. Grant therefore, that we prooue not deſirous of vaine glorie, prouoking one another, and enuieng one another, that we bite not one another to our deſtruction. For of emulation ſpringeth contention, which being once inflamed, boile out into mortall diuiſions. And as manie as maintaine emulations, contentions, and factions, are carnall, and walke as men. Wherefore, take from vs the zeale of the fleſh, which is fooliſh: and let all enuie, wrath, pride, and arrogancie be far from vs. Likewiſe let vs auoid fooliſh and vnlearned queſtions, knowing that they engender ſtrife and contention, and ſerue for nothing, but to the ſubuerting of the hearers, & ingraffing of errors. Where a deſire of ſtrife is, there certainlie God dwelleth not: and they which raiſe tumults of nothing, and diſquiet thy flocke: thoſe wilt thou, O ſonne of God, deſtroie.
                        Come holie ſpirit, repleniſh the harts of the faithfull here aſſembled, and elſe where: and inflame in them the fire of thy loue, which once didſt gather the nations into the vnitie of the faith, through the diuerſitie of tongues. Ioine our harts togither, that wee may nouriſh chriſtian concord among vs, and that wee all glued as it were together in louing harts, may be of one mind in thee: ſo ſhall thy pure doctrine zealouſlie be mainteined, and no falſe interpretation of the ſcripture obſtinatelie be defended. Bring home to thy fold all ſuch as are turned from the vnitie of true religion, that thrre may be one paſtor, and one fold. To ſuch as are gone out from vs, grant conſtancie; that they may

continue with vs, teaching the Goſpell to the ſaluation of the hearers. And if it happen that anie, contrarie to the doctrine which they haue learned, raiſe diſſention and offences; grant that we may auoid them, leaſt the harts of the ſimple, through their ſweet perſuaſions and flatterie, be deceiued. O God, author of peace and concord, giue grace, that euerie of vs may thinke the ſame thing, acording to our Sauior Chriſt,

                        In time of drought for raine.
                        
                           O GOD heauenlie father, which by thy ſonne Ieſus Chriſt haſt promiſed to all them that ſeeke thy kingdome, and the righteouſneſſe thereof, all things neceſſarie to their bodilie ſuſtenance; ſend vs, wee beſeech thee, in this our neceſſitie, ſuch moderate raine and ſhowers, that we may receiue the fruites of the earth to our comfort, and to thy honor, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another.
                        
                           ALmightie God mercifull Father, who in thy holie word haſt promiſed to heare the praiers of thy people, which they ſhall make in this place of thy holie temple: behold now that thou haſt ſhut vp heauen, and there is no raine giuen vnto the earth, but a drought doth vtterlie deſtroie the fruites of the earth, for our ſinnes and iniquities; we come vnto thee, and confeſſe our ſinnes, wherewith we haue prouoked thee thus to anger againſt vs, and thy creatures, for our ſakes. We, I ſaie, whome thou dooeſt iuſtlie thus afflict with drought and barrenneſſe

of the earth, returne vnto thee with all our harts, in faſting, weeping, and mourning, beſeeching thee, by hartie and earneſt praier, to haue mercie vpon vs, and deale not with vs as we haue righteouſlie deſerued. Heare thou now in heauen, and pardon the ſinnes of thy ſeruants, and giue raine vnto the land, that thou haſt giuen the people to inhabit. Heare, O Lord, I ſaie, the crie of man and beaſt, and open the treaſures of the heauens, and giue vnto vs moderate ſhowres to water the earth, that our cattell may bee ſatiſfied, and our drought ceaſſe. Oh Lord haſt thou vtterlie reiected vs, or doth thy ſoule abhorre thy people for euer, that thou haſt ſo long plagued vs with drought and want of water? Our iniquities in deede teſtifie againſt vs, and our rebellions are more than can be numbred. For we haue ſinned againſt heauen, and againſt thee, and haue beene verie noiſome to the earth, and all thy creatures therin. But, O Lord, thou hope of Iſrael, thou comfort, helpe and ſauiour of all that are in trouble; haue mercie vpon vs, haue mercie vpon vs; and doo not abhorre vs, nor caſt vs off for euer. O Lord, are there anie among the gods of the Gentiles, that can ſend raine? Or can the heauens of themſelues giue ſhowres to the earth? Is it not onlie thou, O Lord our God, which haſt made heauen and earth, and dooeſt all things by thy mightie power that muſt doo it? O ſaue the people therefore that call vpon thee. O let the daie come, wherein thou wilt vouchſafe to heare vs, O Lord; when I ſaie thou wilt heare the heauens, and the heauens may heare the earth, & the earth heare the corne, and the wine, and the oile, and they all heare one another, and thou heare Iſrael, that thou maiſt haue mercie vpon vs, and cauſe to come downe for vs the raine, euen the firſt raine, and the latter raine, in the firſt and ſecond moneths, in due ſeaſons vpon the earth, that our barns may be full of

wheate, and our preſſes abound with wine and oile, & our cattell ſerue to labour by thy bleſſing, & that both man & beaſt may ceaſe their mourning, and haue cauſe to reioice in thy mercie. Graunt vs this, O father, for Ieſus Chriſts ſake, our onlie mediator and aduocate, to whome with thee, and the holie Ghoſt, be all honor and glorie, now and for euer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another praier for the fruits of the earth.
                        
                        
                           O Lord God almightie, King of heauen and earth, which of thine abundant goodneſſe dooſt adorne and repleniſh the earth with all kind of fruit and graine, whereby the life both of man and beaſt is ſuſteined: we beſeech thee, euen for thy free mercie, that thou wouldeſt vouchſafe to bleſſe our feelds, and ground, and to make them proſperouſlie to yeeld their corne and increaſe. For without thy bleſſing and fauour, neither can the earth of it ſelfe bring foorth anie whit, nor we by our paines make the ſame to proſper. Wherefore, grant to all things, ſpringing from the earth, a meet temperature of aire; that luckilie they may take and increaſe. Keepe our fruit vpon the face of the earth from all infection of the aire; from thunder, haile, from vntimelie ſhowers, from too great drineſſe, and ouermuch heate, from woormes hurtfull, and beaſts deuouring it before their prime, and from all other corruption; that our land in thine anger be not deſolate, and denie vs fruit, enioieng hir wofull Sabboth.
                        Shut not vp the heauens in thine indignation for our ſinnes, that it be not as iron, nor the earth as braſſe, wherby it can not be tilled, ploughed, nor ſowne, and ſo come to a verie plaine and vtter wilderneſſe:

but of thy goodneſſe giue vs both the earlie and latter raine, that we may haue abundance of all fruit, and a ioifull harueſt with a plentifull vintage. O God, ſend a gratious raine vpon thine inheritance, and giue thy bleſſing, that our ground may bring foorth hir fruit. Cauſe thy raine to powre downe in due ſeaſon, that it may be raine of bleſſing; whereby both trees may giue their fruit, & the ground yeeld foorth hir graine. Grant alſo that the aire be pure from infection, our bodies free from ſickneſſe, to our whole Realme peace and quietneſſe, that ſafelie without trouble we may enioie thy gifts. Driue awaie and repell from vs malediction, and the deſtroier. Giue vs not in ſtead of raine, duſt and aſhes; but open thy good treaſures, and viſit the land with thy bleſſing, make it drunken, and enrich it abundantlie.
                        Thy riuer, O Lord, is full of water; prepare our corne, and diſpoſe our earth to proſper; water abundantlie the furrowes of the ſame, and cauſe the raine to deſcend into the vallies thereof; make the ſame ſoft with ſhowers, and bleſſe our buds. Crowne the yeere with thy goodneſſe, and let thy clouds drop fatneſſe; let them drop vpon the paſtures of the wilderneſſe, and make the little hils reioice on euerie ſide. Let the plaines be repleniſhed with ſheepe, and the vallies with corne, that the inhabitants of the earth may reioice and be merie.
                        O Lord, thou cauſeſt graſſe to growe for cattell, and herbs for ye vſe of man; thou bringeſt foorth bread out of the earth, & wine to make glad the hart of man; oile to make the countenance cheerfull, & bread for to ſtrengthen the hart. Haue therefore a care, O heauenlie Father, of the ſeed, and other things ſpringing from the earth: keepe them both in cold, raine, ice, and ſnowe, from the beating of winds, and iniurie of weather. Preſerue them in extreame heat, drineſſe, moiſtneſſe,

and ſuch like; that they periſh not afore their time. Roote out the deſtroier, that there be neither blaſting, mildew, nor graſhopper, neither caterpiller hurting the fruits of the earth.
                        Keepe vs, O Lord, in the time of dearth; that we periſh not for hunger, nor be confounded in the perilous time. For thou art our God and Creator, which ſatiſfieſt the thirſtie ſoule, and filleſt the hungrie with goodneſſe, which haſt ſaid; I will not faile, neither forſake thee; whereby being faithfull, we may ſaie; The Lord is with vs, therefore we will not feare what man can doo vnto vs. Behold, we miſerable & great ſinners doo confeſſe our wickednes, with groning & griefe of hart, crieng vnto thee which art in heauen. Heare our praiers in thy dwelling place, & be mercifull to thy people, which haue ſinned againſt thee; and forgiue vs all our iniquities, wherein we haue tranſgreſſed againſt thee. By our ſinnes wee haue brought all theſe miſeries, which hang ouer our heads; but blot out all our offences, O God, after thy manifold mercies; and take awaie from vs the curſe of our ground, that the people may praiſe thee, O God; yea that all the people may praiſe thee, and the earth bring foorth hir increaſe; through our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, thine onelie ſonne, which liueth and reigneth with thee, in the vnitie of the holie ſpirit, a God for euermore,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        For faire weather.
                        
                           O Lord God, which for the ſinne of man didſt once drowne all the world except eight perſons; & afterward of thy great mercie didſt promiſe neuer to deſtroie it ſo againe: we humblie beſeech thee, that although we for oure iniquities haue woorthilie deſerued this plague of raine and waters; yet vpon our true repentance thou wilt

ſend vs ſuch weather, whereby we may receiue the fruits of the earth in due ſeaſon; and learne both by thy puniſhment to amend our liues, and for thy clemencie to giue thee praiſe and glorie, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        A praier in time of vnſeaſonable ſhowers, for faire weather.
                        
                        
                           
                              O
                            God and mercifull Father, wee acknowledge that we, through our manifold ſinnes, haue deſerued to be ſharpelie rebuked and corrected of thee: but if thou ſhouldeſt deale with vs after our ſinnes, we are not able to abide thy wrath and heauie hand. Wherfore deale mercifullie with vs, O Lord, after the greatneſſe of thy goodneſſe, and the multitude of thy mercies; that wee rather may reioice, and be thankfull vnto thee, for the abundance of thy great mercie, and louing kindneſſe, than be caſt downe and diſcouraged, by the heauie weight of thy hand. In thy hands, O Lord, are both heauen and earth; ſo gouerne them therefore, we beſeech thee, for thy name ſake; that we may haue ſeaſonable weather, to receiue the fruits of the earth. Staie the unmoderate plentie of raine, and vnſeaſonable weather: and powre rather vpon vs the plentifull dew of thy ſpirit, that we may dailie growe to the perfection of Chriſtian men and women. Take awaie from vs our ſtonie harts, and giue vnto vs in ſtead there of harts of fleſh, that we may ceaſe at the length thus to prouoke thy wrath, to bring vpon vs either this ſo great a plague, as the loſſe of the fruits of the earth; either elſe other plagues of thy iuſt iudgments. Grant that we may ſo repent vs of our former euils, that hereafter the woorthie fruits of true repentance

may continuallie appeare therein, and ſo to paſſe ouer and to end our mortall liues; that at the laſt we may attaine vnto the bleſſed reſurrection, and life euerlaſting, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        In time of thunder, lightening, raging tempeſts, and vnſeaſonable weather, praie thus:
                        
                        
                           
                              O
                            Moſt wiſe & mightie God, thou art a glorious King in all the world; thy woonderfull maieſtie doth ſhine and is knowne alſo by raine, thundering, lightening, and other meteors ingendred in the aire. Thy throne is among the clouds, thou haſt made darkeneſſe thy ſecrete place and thy pauilion about thee, euen darkneſſe of water, and clouds of the aire. At the brightneſſe of thy preſence the clouds doo paſſe awaie; ſo doo the haile-ſtones and firie coales. Thou dooeſt thunder from the heauens, and giueſt thy voice; haileſtones and coales of fire. Thou ſendeſt thine arrowes, and ſcattereſt them; thou increaſeſt lightenings, and deſtroieſt them. Who is ſo great a god as thou our God? Thou art the God which dooeſt woonders, and declareſt thy power among the nations. Thou redeemeſt thy people with thine arme. The waters ſawe thee, and were afraid; the depths trembled. The clouds powred out water, the aire thundered, and thine arrowes went abroad. The voice of thy thunder was heard round about the world, the earth trembled and ſhooke. The foundations of the earth ſhooke and were diſcouered, at thy rebuking, O Lord; at the blaſting of the breath of thy noſtrels.
                        Therefore ſhall the verie heauens extoll thy woonderous works, and the Saints ſet foorth thy truth in the congregation. For who is equall to thee in heauen?

And who like thee among the ſonnes of the gods? Thou art verie terrible in the aſſemblie of the ſaints, and to be reuerenced aboue all that are about thee. O Lord God of hoſts, who is like vnto thee; which art a mightie Lord, and thy truth is about thee? Thou ruleſt the raging of the ſea, thou ſtilleſt the waues thereof, when they doo ariſe. Thou onlie art of power to reſolue into vapours the drops of the ſea, by the heat of the ſunne; thou takeſt the ſame vp being turned into airie ſubſtance, and againe turneſt it into meere water, and makeſt it to come powring downe vpon the face of the earth. Whatſoeuer thou wilt, thou dooeſt in heauen, and in earrh, and in the ſea, and in all deepe places. With thy power thou madeſt the earth, with thy wiſdome thou haſt eſtabliſhed the world, and with thy diſcretion ſtretcheſt out the heauens.
                        As ſoone as thou letteſt thy voice be heard, the waters in the aire waxe fierce. Thou draweſt vp the clouds from the ends of the earth, thou turneſt the lightening into raine, and bringeſt foorth the wind out of thy treaſures. Thou couereſt the heauens with clouds, and prepareſt raine for the earth. Thou makeſt the graſſe to growe vpon the mountaines, and prouideſt herbs for the vſe of man. Thou giueſt to beaſts their food, and to the yoong rauens that crie. Behold, ſo great art thou, that thou paſſeſt our knowledge; neither can the number of thy yeeres be ſearched out. When thou reſtraineſt the drops of water, the raine powreth downe by the vapours thereof, and falleth abundantlie vpon man. Thou bringeſt foorth the winds out of thy treaſures; that is, from thy ſecret places, where thou diddeſt hide them in great abundance, that they might be readie at thy commandement, and come foorth when thou thinkeſt good. Thou makeſt the clouds to labour to giue water to the earth, and ſcattereſt the cloud of thy light; thou turneſt

it about by thy gouernement, that they may doo whatſoeuer thou commandeſt them vpon the whole world.
                        O God, mine hart is troubled verie ſore, when I behold the immoderate ſhowers, and heare the terrible thunder: yea it forſaketh his place, when I heare the noiſe of thy voice, and the ſpeech proceeding from thy mouth. O God, which ruleſt heauen and earth, I moſt humblie beſeech thee, mercifullie to driue awaie, or atleaſt to mitigate theſe mightie ſtreames, and moſt raging tempeſts. Reſtraine the thunderbolts, and thy firie darts, that they hurt vs not. Keepe vs, and our neſts, that we periſh not through lightenings, nor be deſtroied by thy thunderclaps. Protect our houſes and vs, that we be neither conſumed by thy firie meteor, nor drowned by thy ſudden floud. O mercifull God, raine not, I beſeech thee, haileſtones vpon the face of the earth; neither ſtrike ſuch as are in the fields, be they man or beaſt. Strike not thou therewith all the herbes of the feeld; neither breake thou, gratious Lord, the trees of our land. Deſtroie not our corne with haileſtones, nor with haileſtones ſmite thou our cattell, and deliuer our flocks from the thunderbolt. Caſt not the feerceneſſe of thy wrath, anger, and diſpleaſure vpon vs. Giue vs not haileſtones for raine, neither flames of fire in our land; but of thy mercie conuert the thunder into gentle raine, whereby it may bring out fruit aboundantlie. Send not among vs either vntimelie or vntemperate ſhowres, which be either noiſome to the fruits, and bring the mildew, or deſtroie the corne. Reſtraine in like ſort the winds and violent tempeſts, that they bring none hurt, neither to vs or our goods, euen for Chriſtes ſake, our Lord and Sauiour,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        
                        In time of dearth, or famine.
                        
                           O GOD, heauenlie father, whoſe gift it is that the raine doth fall, the earth is fruitfull, beaſts increaſe, and fiſhes doo multiplie; behold, we beſeech thee, the afflictions of thy people; and graunt that the ſcarſitie and dearth, which we doo now moſt iuſtlie ſuffer for our iniquitie, may through thy goodneſſe be mercifullie turned into cheapeneſſe and plentie, for the loue of Ieſu Chriſt our Lord, to whome with thee, and the holie Ghoſt, bee praiſe for euer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another praier in time of anie plague or ſickneſſe, warre, penurie, orſcarſeneſſe, &c.
                        
                        
                           O Eternall and euerliuing God, moſt mercifull father, which of thy great long ſuffering and patience, haſt hitherto ſuffered and borne with vs, moſt miſerable offenders, who haue ſo long ſtraied out of thy waie, and broken all thy lawes and commandements; and haue neither by thy manifold benefits beſtowed vpon vs vnworthie and vnthankefull ſinners; nor by the voice of thy ſeruants and preachers by continuall threatnings out of thy holie word hitherto bin moued, as the children of loue, to returne vnto thee our moſt gratious father; either for feare of thy iudgements, as humble and lowlie ſeruants, to turne from our wickedneſſe. And therefore, moſt righteous iudge, thy patience being as it were ouercome at the laſt, with our obſtinate repentance, thou haſt moſt iuſtlie executed thoſe thy terrible threats, now partlie vpon vs, by plaguing vs ſo with

moſt dreadfull and deadlie ſickneſſe, with troubles of warres, with penurie and ſcarſeneſſe of foode and victuall, whereby great multitudes of vs are dailie afflicted, and conſumed.
                        We beſeech thee, O moſt mercifull father, that in thy wrath thou wilt remember thine old great mercies, & to correct vs in thy iudgements, and not in thy iuſt anger, leaſt we be all conſumed, and brought to naught. Looke not ſo much vpon our deſeruings, O moſt righteous Iudge, to take iuſt vengeance on our ſinnes; but rather remember thine infinit mercies, O moſt mercifull father, promiſed to vs by thy deerelie beloued ſonne our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt; for whoſe ſake, and in whoſe name, we doo earneſtlie and humblie craue mercie, and forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes, and deliuerance from this horrible ſickneſſe, wars, dearth, &c. being thy iuſt puniſhment, and plague for the ſame. And as thy holie word doth teſtifie, that thy people of all ages, being iuſtlie plagued for their ſinnes, and yet in their diſtreſſe, vnfeinedlie turning vnto thee, and ſuing for thy mercie, obteined the ſame: ſo likewiſe we, moſt worthilie now afflicted with greeuous and dreadfull plagues for our iniquities, praie thee, O moſt mercifull father, to grant vs thy heauenlie grace, that we may likewiſe both trulie and vnfeinedlie repent, and obtaine thy mercie and deliuerance, from the ſame; which we beſeech thee, O father of all mercies, & God of all conſolation, grant vs for the ſame Ieſus Chriſts ſake, our onlie ſauiour, mediator, and aduocate,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        In time of anie common plague or ſickneſſe.
                        
                           ALmightie God, which in thy wrath, in the time of King Dauid, diddeſt ſlea with the plague of peſtilence threeſcore and tenne thouſand; and yet remembring thy mercie, didſt ſaue the reſt; haue pitie vpon vs

miſerable ſinners, that now are viſited with great ſickneſſe and mortalitie: that like as thou didſt then command thine Angel to ceaſe from puniſhing, ſo it may now pleaſe thee to withdrawe from vs this plague and greeuous ſickneſſe, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        A forme of meditation and praier, verie meete to be vſed dailie of all honſholders in their houſes, eſpeciallie in the dangerous and contagious time of the plague.

                              WE reade in thy holie word, O Lord, what bleſſings thou haſt of thy mercie promiſed to them that liue obedientlie, according to thy bleſſed will and commandements. Wee reade alſo the curſſes that thy inſtice hath pronounced againſt ſuch as deſpiſe thy word, or negligentlie paſſe not to liue thereafter. And among the reſt of thy heauie curſſes, thou threateneſt by name, the plague and the peſtilence, with other noiſome and moſt painfull diſeaſes, to ſuch as forſaking thee, worſhip ſtrange gods, and followe their owne vaine fantaſies, in ſtead of thy ſacred ordinances.
                           We find alſo, how extreamelie thine owne people, the Iewes, haue oftentimes fealt the performance of

theſe thy bitter threatenings, and that for ſundrie and diuers offences: bicauſe they loathed Manna, and were not contented with thy miraculous prouiſion; but would haue Qualies, and other daintie victuals, to content their luxurious appetites, thou ſleweſt ſo manie with a ſudden and mightie plague, that the place of their buriall was named thereof, and called The graues of luſt.
                           
                           Alſo, for murmuring againſt the miniſters of thy word, Moſes and Aaron, thou deſtroiedſt with a ſudden plague xiiij. thouſand and more; beſides thoſe traitors, whom the earth ſwallowed for their rebellion. And had not Aaron intreated for them, and gone betweene the quicke and the dead, thou wouldeſt haue conſumed them all; as thou waſt minded to haue done before, when they deſpiſed the plentifull land, which thou hadſt promiſed them; had not Moſes ſtaied thy wrath, when thou ſaiedſt, I will ſtrike them with the peſtilence, and vtterlie deſtroie them.
                           
                           Furthermore, when they had loſt thine Ark, through their owne ſinnes, and the ſinnes of their prieſts, the keepers therof, after that the Philiſtines were forced, through thy plaguing hand, religiouſly to ſend it home againe; thou ſtrookeſt with the plague fiftie thouſand of the Beth-ſamites thy people, for raſhlie preſuming to looke into the ſame, not hauing thy warrant ſo to doo.
                           In the time of King Dauid thou deſtroiedſt three ſcore and ten thouſand of thy people, in three daies, with thy waſting plague of peſtilence; mooued thereto by the tranſgreſſion of Dauid the King, whom for the ſinnes of the people thou ſufferedſt to be tempted, and ſubdued with a vaine curioſitie to number the people.
                           Alſo, ſhortlie after the death of that immaculate Lambe our Sauiour, thou ſufferedſt the plague to

reigne among the members of his bodie, the Church of the Corinthians; for not worthilie preparing themſelues, and for miſvſing the Sacrament of the bodie and bloud of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt: and manie died thereof, as thine holie Apoſtle Saint Paule hath taught vs.
                           Since which time, O Lord, as the Monuments of thy Church, and other Chronicles doo declare, thou haſt from time to time ſo plagued with peſtilence, not onelie cities, but alſo whole countries for theſe and other like cauſes, that we may iuſtlie looke for the comming of our Sauiour; ſo manie and ſo horrible peſtilences haue beene among vs alreadie.
                           All which cauſes, O Lord, for the which thou haſt ſo afflicted thy people, are through the malice of Satan, and our wilfull conſenting vnto him, growne ſo ripe in vs; that were it not for the exceeding greatnes of thy mercie and compaſſion, we ſhould all preſentlie periſh, and that woorthilie; ſo horrible and outragious are our iniquities.
                           For we loath, not onelie the plentifull prouiſion of wholeſome victuals and apparell, which thou haſt giuen vs for our bodies, more abundantlie than to manie nations; trauelling by all meanes to get wherewith to pamper our fleſh with wines, ſpices, ſilks, and other vaine, coſtlie, and delighting things: but the pretious Manna of our ſoules, thy holie word and Sacraments, we can not awaie with; we are ſo full, that we are glutted therewith.
                           We ſo little eſteeme the heauenlie kingdome, which our Sauiour hath ſo deerlie prepared, and kindlie promiſed to vs; that we abhor it, and are readie to ſtone thoſe few that commend it, and exhort vs for our owne good to trauell thitherward: better liking and crediting thoſe falſe prophets the Epicures, and Atheiſts, that with their lies diſcourage vs therefrom.
                           
                              
What murmuring and grudging make we againſt the miniſters of thy word, which thou of thine eſpeciall goodneſſe haſt in mercie giuen vs? How deſpiſe wee our biſhops, preachers, and other miniſters of thy holie Sacraments, whom thou haſt commanded vs to reuerence and honour?
                           Did not we, through our wicked liues, wretchedlie leeſe the Arke of thy holie word, and the true miniſtration of Sacraments, not manie yeeres agone, which the popiſh Philiſtines tooke from vs? And now, when thou through thy plagues laid vpon them haſt miraculouſlie ſent it againe; ſee how hold we be with the Beth-ſamites, vnreuerentlie to receiue it. For manie make of it a gazing-ſtocke, to ſerue their eies and tongues; rather than a lawe, to obeie and followe in their liues.
                           Yea, the knowledge of thy truth, goodneſſe, and mercie, breedeth in manie of vs a careleſſe ſecuritie, and a contempt of thy holie ordinances. For we preſume vpon thy mercie and promiſes; not regarding the conditions, nor anie of thy commandements, which in our baptiſme we vowed to obſerue. Yea, we make thy Goſpell a cloke of our couetouſneſſe, vnder colour whereof we ſeeke our owne lucre, and hide all our wicked and filthie practiſes.
                           If the Corinthians deſerued to be plagued for abuſing thy holie Sacraments, how much more are wee woorthie of fierce wrath, that not onelie abuſe it; but alſo abhor & contemne it: bicauſe it is miniſtred as it ought? For thou knoweſt, O Lord, what a ſort there are, which bewitched with the diuell, and the Popes doctrine, doo vtterlie abhor Chriſts holie communion; and ſauing for feare of the lawe, would neuer come at it. In what ſort theſe receiue, and how they be prepared, is not vnknowne vnto thee. How raſhlie alſo, and vnaduiſedlie, and vnprepared the common multitude

doo frequent it; partlie appeareth, in that manie of them neuer forgiue old offences, nor reconcile themſelues, nor in anie thing doo amend their old ſinnes and vices.
                           Seeing then that we, Lord, the common ſort and multitude doo thus abound in all kind of wickedneſſe; how can it be, but that thou of thy iuſtice, muſt ſuffer our magiſtrates to offend alſo in ſomewhat, to the end thou maiſt iuſtlie take vengeance of our ſinnes?
                           For theſe manifold heapes of ſinnes and wickedneſſes, O Lord, thou haſt iuſtlie at this preſent ſent this dangerous peſtilence among vs; as thou haſt often and long time threatened by the mouthes of thy faithfull preachers, who continuallie haue called vpon vs, to ſtaie thy wrath, by earneſt repentance & amendement of life: but we haue alwaies beene deafer and deafer. The delight in our ſinnes not onlie ſtopped our eares, but alſo hardened our harts againſt their hartie and friendlie admonitions. And in that we now, O Lord, doo begin to feele and acknowledge our ſinnes; it commeth more of thy rigour in plaguing vs, than of anie good inclination of our ſelues. Mollifie therefore, O Lord, our flintie harts, with the ſuppling moiſture of thy holie ſpirit. Make vs to reuerence thee, as children, for loue of thy mercies; and not to dread thee like ſlaues, for feare of puniſhment.
                        
                        
                           Seruants:

                           Maiſter or Maiſtres.
                           O deere Father, reclaime vs thy loſt children. O mercifull Sauiour, pitie vs thy putrified members. O holie Ghoſt, repaire vs thy decaied temples. O holie and glorious Trinitie, haue mercie vpon vs miſerable ſinners.
                        
                        
                           Seruants:

                           Maiſter.
                           Grant vs, O Lord, ſuch true repentance, as may, through the bloud of our Sauiour, blot out the ſtaines of our heinous iniquities. Forgiue vs our

ſinnes, O Lord; forgiue vs our ſinnes, for thine infinite mercies ſake.
                        
                        
                           Seruants:
                           Amen.
                        
                        
                           Maiſter.
                           Forgiue vs our blaſphemies, idolatries, and periuries. Forget our vaine and outragious oths. As thou haſt by thy rigour and plagues, forced vs to acknowledge thee, to be our iuſt and righteous Lord: ſo let vs, through thy mercie and forgiueneſſe, feele thee to be our mild & louing Father, and giue vs grace for euer hereafter to reuerence this thy glorious name.
                        
                        
                           Seru.
                           Amen.
                        
                        
                           Maiſter.
                           Take from vs, O God, the care of worldlie vanities. Make vs content with neceſſaries. Plucke awaie our harts from delighting in honours, treaſures, and pleaſures of this life. And ingender in vs a deſire to be with thee in thine eternall kingdome. Giue vs, O Lord, ſuch taſte and feeling of thine vnſpeake able ioies in heauen, that we may alwaie long therfore, ſaieng with thine elect; Haſten thy kingdome, O Lord; take vs to thee.
                        
                        
                           Seru.
                           Amen.
                        
                        
                           Maiſter.
                           Make vs, O Lord, obedient to thy will reuealed in thy holie word. Make vs diligent to walke in thy commandements. Forgiue vs our contempt and murmuring againſt the magiſtrates and miniſters, whom thou haſt in thy mercie appointed: make vs obedient vnto their godlie lawes & doctrine. Saue and preſerue, O Lord, thine annointed our QVEENE ELIZABETH: that ſhe, in thy grace and feare, may long reigne amongſt vs. Giue peace to all Chriſtian nations. Mooue vs by thy ſpirit to loue one another, as the members of our bodie; that we may all doo thy will in earth, as it is in heauen.
                        
                        
                           Seru.
                           Amen.
                        
                        
                           Maiſter.
                           Dig out of vs, O Lord, the venemous roots of couetouſneſſe and concupiſcence; or elſe ſo repreſſe

them with thy grace, that we may be contented with thy prouiſion of neceſſaries: and not to labour, as we doo, with toile, ſtrength, guile, wrong, and oppreſſion to pamper our ſelues with vaine ſuperfluities. Feed our ſoules, O Lord, dailie with the true Manna of thy heauenlie word, and with the grace of thy holie Sacraments. Giue vs grace continuallie to read, heare, and meditate thy purpoſes, iudgments, promiſes, and precepts; not to the end we may curiouſlie argue therof, or arrogantlie preſume thervpon; but to frame our liues according to thy will, that by keeping thy couenants, we may be ſure of thy promiſes: and ſo make our election and vocation certaine, through our conſtant faith, vertuous and godlie liuing.
                        
                        
                           Seru.
                           Amen.
                        
                        
                           Maiſter.
                           Confirme vs, O Lord, to the image of our Sauiour. So lighten the lamps of our harts with the fire and burning flames of thy loue, that no enuie, rancor, hatred, or malice doo remaine in vs, to quench it: but that we may gladlie forgiue, whatſoeuer wrong is, or ſhall be, either maliciouſlie or ignorantlie done or ſaid againſt vs. And here, Lord, in thy preſence; for thy Maieſtie is euerie where; we forgiue whatſoeuer hath beene, by anie man or woman practiſed againſt vs: beſeeching thèe, of thy goodneſſe likewiſe to forgiue it. And further, for thy mercies ſake; and for our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſts ſake, we beſeech thee, O deere Father, to forgiue vs theſe horrible and damnable ſinnes, which we haue committed againſt thy Maieſtie; for which thou haſt now iuſtlie brought the peſtilence and plague vpon vs. Let the ceaſing thereof, we beſeech thee, certifie vs of thy mercie and remiſſion.
                        
                        
                           Seru.
                           Amen.
                        
                        
                           Maiſter.
                           We knowe, O Lord, the weakeneſſe of our ſelues; and how readie we are to fall from thee. Suffer not therfore Satan to ſhew his power and malice

vpon vs. For we are not able to withſtand his aſſalts. Arme vs, O Lord, alwaies with thy grace; and aſſiſt vs with thy holie ſpirit in all kinds of temptations.
                        
                        
                           Seruants.
                           Amen.
                        
                        
                           Maiſter.
                           Deliuer vs, O deere father, from all euils, both bodilie and ghoſtlie. Deliuer, O Lord, from trouble of conſcience, all that are ſnarled in their ſins. Deliuer, O Lord, from feare of perſecution and tyrannie, our brethren and ſiſters, that are vnder the croſſe for profeſſion of thy word. Deliuer, O mercifull father, thoſe that for our ſinnes and offences, are alreadie tormented with the rage of peſtilence. Recouer thoſe, O Lord, that are alreadie ſtriken; and ſaue the reſt of my houſhold, and elſe-where, from this greeuous infection.
                        
                        
                           Seruants.
                           Amen.
                        
                        
                           Maiſter.
                           Finallie, O Lord God, which for our innumerable ſinnes, dooeſt heere fatherlie correct vs, to the end we ſhould not feele the rigour of thy ſeueare iudgement, in eternall condemnation: we humblie ſubmit our ſelues vnto thy grace and pitie; beſeeching thee, for our Lord Ieſus Chriſtes ſake, that although we haue iuſtlie deſerued this plague now laid vpon vs; yet it may pleaſe thee, in the multitude of thy mercies, to withdrawe thy rod from vs. Grant, O Lord, true repentance of our ſinnes, which (as it did in that good King Ezekias) may deliuer vs from the plague laid vpon vs; and cauſe thoſe that be ſicke heere in my houſe, or otherwhere, to recouer. Or, if thou haue determined to take a number of vs out of the miſeries of this preſent euill world, giue vs the comfort of thy holie ſpirit, that may make vs glad, and willing to come vnto thee. Giue vs grace, O Lord, ſo to prepare our ſelues, that we may be readie with the wiſe virgins, to enter into life with our ſauiour Chriſt, whenſoeuer it ſhall pleaſe thee to call vs.
                        
                        
                           Seruants:
                           Amen.
                        
                        
                           
                           Maiſter.
                           Grant this, O deere father, for Ieſus Chriſtes ſake, our onlie Mediator, Aduocate, Lord, Redeemer, and Sauiour; to whome, with thee, and the holie Ghoſt, be all honor and glorie, world without end: and in whoſe name we, altogether, with one hart and voice, crie furthermore, and praie vnto thee, as he in his holie word hath taught vs, ſaieng:
                        
                        
                           Maiſter and ſeruants altogether.
                           Our Father, &c.
                        
                     
                     
                        Other Pſalmes and praiers to be ſaid in the time of anie common plague, ſickneſſe, or other croſſe and viſitation of God, by the Maiſter and Miſtreſſe, with their familie.
                        
                        
                           O Come, let vs humble our ſelues, & fall downe before the Lord with reuerence and feare.
                        For he is the Lord our God: and we are the people of his paſture, and the ſheepe of his hands.
                        Come therefore, let vs turne againe vnto our Lord, for he hath ſmitten vs, and he ſhall heale vs.
                        Let vs repent and turne from our wickedneſſe, and our ſinnes ſhall be forgiuen vs.
                        Let vs turne, and the Lord will turne from his heauie wrath, and will pardon vs, and we ſhall not periſh.
                        For we knowledge our faults, and our ſinnes be euer before vs.
                        We haue ſore prouoked thine anger, O Lord; thy wrath is waxed hot, and thy heauie diſpleaſure is ſore kindled againſt vs.
                        Thou haſt made vs heare of the noiſe of warres, and haſt troubled vs by the vexation of enimies.
                        Thou haſt in thine indignation ſtriken vs with greeuous ſicknes, and by and by we haue fallen as leaues beaten downe with a vehement wind.
                        
                           
Indeede we acknowledge, that all puniſhments are leſſe than our deſeruings: but yet of thy mercie, Lord, correct vs to amendment, and plague vs not to our deſtruction.
                        For thy hand is not ſhortened, that thou canſt not helpe: neither is thy goodneſſe abated, that thou wilt not heare.
                        Thou haſt promiſed, that afore we crie thou wilt heare vs: and whileſt we yet ſpeake, thou wilt haue mercie vpon vs.
                        For none that truſt in thee, ſhall be confounded; neither anie that call vpon thee, ſhall be deſpiſed.
                        For thou art the onlie Lord, who woundeſt and dooeſt heale: againe, who killeſt, and reuiueſt; bringeſt euen to hell, and bringeſt barke againe.
                        Our fathers hoped in thee, they truſted in thee, and thou didſt deliuer them.
                        They called vpon thee, and were helped; they put their truſt in thee, and were not confounded.
                        O Lord rebuke vs not in thine indignation: neither chaſten vs in thy heauie diſpleaſure.
                        Oh remember not the ſinnes and offences of our youth: but according to thy mercie thinke vpon vs, O Lord, for thy goodneſſe.
                        Haue mercie vpon vs, O Lord, for we are weake: O Lord heale vs, for our bones are vexed.
                        And now in the vexation of our ſpirits, and the anguiſh of our ſoules, we remember thee: and we crie vnto thee; heare Lord, and haue mercie.
                        For thine owne ſake, for thy holie name ſake, incline thine eare and heare, O mercifull Lord.
                        For we doo not powre out our praiers before thy face, truſting in our owne righteouſneſſe: but in thy great and manifold mercies.
                        Waſh vs throughlie from our wickedneſſe, and cleanſe vs from our ſinnes.
                        
                           
Turne thy face from our ſinnes, and put out all our miſdeeds.
                        Make vs cleane harts, O God, and renew a right ſpirit within vs.
                        Helpe vs, O God of our ſaluation, for the glorie of thy name. O deliuer vs, and be mercifull vnto our ſinnes, for thy name ſake.
                        So we that be thy people, and ſheepe of thy paſture, ſhall giue thee thanks for euer; and will alwaies bee ſhewing foorth thy praiſe from generation to generation.
                        Glorie be to the Father, &c. As it was in the, &c.
                     
                     
                        Another praier to be ſaid in the time of the plague, ſickneſſe, and mortalitie.
                        
                        
                           
                              O
                            Lord our God, great and fearefull art thou, keeping couenant and mercie with them that loue thee, and keepe thy commandements. We haue ſinned, O Lord, and haue committed iniquitie. We haue don wickedlie; yea wee haue rebelled, and haue departed from thy iudgements. We haue not obeied thy ſeruants the Prophets, which ſpake in thy name, to our kings and princes, to our forefathers, and to all the people of the land.
                        O Lord, righteouſneſſe belongeth vnto thee; but vnto vs open ſhame and confuſion; as it is come to paſſe this daie, by the plague and ſickneſſe reigning among vs, and among all the dwellers of this land, becauſe of the ſins which we haue done againſt thee. Unto thee, O Lord and God, pertaineth compaſſion, and forgiueneſſe; though we haue rebelled againſt thee. We haue not obeied thy voice, to walke in the lawes which thou haſt laid before vs. We haue hitherto deſpiſed thy diuine

word, yea we haue loathed preaching, and haue loaſed the bridle to all beaſtlineſſe of deſires.
                        Therefore the curſſe and oth, which is written in the lawe of Moſes thy ſeruant, is powred vpon vs; and we, through the plague and corrupt aires, with burning feauers, and greeuous ſickneſſe, are lamentablie conſumed euerie daie. Yea in our knees and legs are we ſmitten with moſt lothſome botches, and thoſe incurable, from the ſole of the foote vnto the top of the head. Becauſe we repent not, neither obſerue all the words written in thy lawe, nor feare thy glorious and dreadfull name, thou doeſt, according to thy threatnings aforetold, increaſe our plagues, & the plagues of our ſeed. Thou ſendeſt great plagues, and of long continuance; euill ſickneſſe, and of long durance. Thou bringeſt vpon vs vncurable diſeaſes, all maner of ſickneſſe, and all kinds of plagues, beſides thoſe written in the booke of the lawe.
                        All theſe plagues, according to thy word, are come vpon vs, yet haue we not praied vnto thee our Lord, that we might euerie one turne from our vngodlie waies. Therefore haſt thou bin wrathfull in puniſhing vs, and in bringing theſe euils vpon vs. Thou art righteous, O Lord, and true is thy iudgement. O God Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, thou haſt got thee a glorious name, as may appeare this daie. O Lord our God, we haue ſinned; we haue done wickedlie: we haue behaued our ſelues vngodlie in all thine ordinances. Turne thy wrath away from vs, we beſeech thee: for we are but a few left in this place.
                        O Lord God, which haſt promiſed, that when either peſtilence among vs, or the aire infected, or anie other plague or ſickneſſe is hot; thou wilt heare the praiers, and grant the requeſts of anie man or woman among the people, praieng from the bottome of his hart, acknowledging his ſinnes vnfeinedlie, and lifting vp his

hands vnto thee, thorough Ieſus Chriſt, before the throne of grace. Be thou mercifull, giue vnto euerie man according to all his petitions. For thou alone knoweſt the harts of all the children of men. Heare thou our praiers and petitions, and deliuer vs from this contagious and deadlie peſtilence. Command thine Angel, which ſtriketh vs, to put vp his ſwoord into the ſheath; that he ſtrike not to our finall and vtter deſtruction. Proceede not in thy wrath, ſpare vs from death, & bring not our end by the plague. Let the heauens be mild, and our dwelling places healthfull; leaſt the aire being infected, powre downe the contagion thereof vpon vs, to our deſtruction.
                        O Lord turne awaie thine hand, it is ſufficient: let now thine hand ceaſe, that all the earth may knowe, how that thou Lord art our GOD, and that we doo call vpon thy name. O Lord looke downe from thine holie houſe, vpon vs: incline thine eare and heare: open thine eies, and behold the affliction and mortalitie of thy people. For the dead, whoſe ſpirits are taken awaie, giue vnto thee neither praiſe, nor righteouſnes: but the ſoule that is vexed for the multitude of hir ſins, which goeth on heauilie, and weaklie, whoſe eies begin to faile; yea, the hungrie ſoule is it that aſcribeth due praiſe and righteouſneſſe vnto thee, O Lord.
                        For we powre out our praiers before thee, and require mercie in thy ſight, O Lord our God; not for anie woorthineſſe either of our owne, or of our fathers: but in the name of thy ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, in whome thou art well pleaſed: we beſeech thee be mercifull vnto vs, and helpe vs in neceſſitie. Turne thee againe, O Lord, at the laſt, and be mercifull vnto thy ſeruants, that this poiſoned infection maie be taken from vs. Notwithſtanding, if it be thy pleaſure to viſit our offences with the rod, thy bleſſed will be done; and giue vs grace to beare thy fatherlie correction laid vpon vs

patientlie; remembring alwaies, that we are chaſtined of thee our Lord in this world, that we be not condemned with the reprobate in the world to come,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        A fruitfull Praier, verie neceſsarie to be hartilie ſaid at the appearing of monſters, and in anie earthquake, or other plagues, that God would turne awaie his vengeance hanging ouer vs for our ſinnes.
                        
                        
                           OH Lord God, ſtrong and mightie, great and dreadfull; which dwelleſt in the heauens, and workeſt great woonders: we thy miſerable children here, proſtrate vpon the earth, doo moſt humblie beſeech thee to be mercifull vnto vs, to pardon our offences, and to forgiue vs all our ſinnes. O Lord enter not into iudgement with thy ſeruants; for if thou doo, there ſhall no fleſh be ſaued in thy ſight. We confeſſe and acknowledge, O Lord, that it is our ſinnes which haue mooued thee to wrath, and to ſhew ſuch fearefull tokens of thy diſpleaſure towards vs in theſe our daies. Firſt with fire from heauen, betokening thy hot burning indignation, and wrathfull diſpleaſure for ſinne, which aboundeth at this daie: and then with ſuch horrible and monſtrous ſhapes againſt nature, as it was neuer ſeene here in our daies, nor in anie time before vs; which betoken to vs none other thing, but thy plagues to come vpon vs, for our degenerate and monſtrous life and conuerſation: and of late, by the ſtrange & terrible earthquake that ſhooke, or rather that euen vomited vs with fearfull trembling harts, and amazed ſpirits out of our houſes, which we ſo ſhamefully haue polluted and defiled with our vile ſinnes and wickedneſſe: and now laſt of all, by the long and great mortalitie, plague and peſtilence,

thou dooſt & haſt terribly threatened vs, fatherlie warned vs, and mercifullie called vs to repentance. The axe is ſet to the roote of the tree, and if we be not as rotten members, without all ſenſe and feeling, we may perceiue our fearefull deſtruction and deſolation to be at hand, vnleſſe we ſpeedilie repent and turne to thee: bicauſe we haue beene ſo long taught out of thy moſt holie and ſacred word, and yet no fruits of true repentance or Chriſtian life will appeare.
                        Wo and alas to theſe our daies, that neither preaching by word moſt comfortable, nor preaching by monſters moſt ouglie, nor preaching by fire moſt ſtrange, nor preaching by earthquakes moſt terrible, neither yet by plagues and peſtilence moſt horrible, will ſtirre vp our ſtonie harts, and awake vs from our ſinnes.
                        We feare, oh Lord, that the Turks, with all the reſt of the vnbeleeuing will condemne vs in the laſt daie, which if they had beene ſo long inſtructed by the comfortable preaching of thy word, and ſweete promiſes of thy Goſpell; or thy woonders both in heauen and earth, which we haue ſeene, no doubt their righteouſnes would haue ſhined at this day to our great ſhame and confuſion. Thou haſt no leſſe warned vs, oh Lord, of thy fearefull diſpleaſure, & heauie plagues at hand for our great wickedneſſe; than thou didſt the Iſraelits of the horrible deſtruction, which came vpon them, whom thou firſt in mercie didſt call to repentance by the preaching of thy word: but when no warning would ſerue, thou didſt ſend them monſtrous and fearfull ſignes and tokens, to declare that thy viſitation was not farre off. But they, like vnto vs at this daie, did alwaies interpret theſe things after the imagination of their vaine harts, promiſing to themſelues peace, when deſtruction was ouer their heads.
                        Which things, when we doo call to mind, (for as

much as they are written for our learning, example, & warning) it maketh vs to tremble and quake for feare of thy iuſt iudgments. For if thou haſt thus dealt with thine owne deere and choſen children, in token of thy great wrath againſt ſinne: what ſhall we looke for, who doo no leſſe deſerue thy fearfull ſcourge; (and of mercie it is, that thou dooeſt thus long forbeare vs:) but liue as though there were no God at all to be reuenged vpon our ſinnes? It maketh vs to feare and crie unwardlie in our ſoules; Come Lord Ieſu, holie and true in all thy dooings, and ſhorten our daies: bring this our pilgrimage to an end: ſuffer vs not to heape ſinne vpon ſinne vnto the daie of vengeance, leaſt we be caught vp amongſt the number of the wicked and reprobate, which ſhall neuer ſee thy louing countenance.
                        It maketh vs to crie to thee, O Lord, let thy kingdome come, and end this our ſinfull life, wherein we doo nothing but prouoke thee to wrath. Correct vs not, O Lord, in thine indignation; neither chaſten vs in thine heauie diſpleaſure. And though to vs belongeth nothing but ſhame and confuſion; though our offences haue deſerued to be viſited with the rod, and our ſinnes with ſcourges: yet in mercie, Lord, and with fatherlie correction chaſten vs; and thy louing kindneſſe take not awaie from vs. To thee we flie for ſuccour, vnder the wings of thy mercie ſhall be our refuge, vntill thou turne thy wrathfull countenance from vs. We knowe that thy mercie is aboue all thy works, and euen as great as thy ſelfe: therefore will we ſaie with holie Iob; Though thou kill vs, yet we put our truſt in thee.
                        Thou cameſt to comfort and plucke out of the dungeon of hell, ſuch wretches as we are. Thou art the good Samaritane, that cameſt to heale our deadlie wounds. Thou art that good Phyſician, that cameſt to

cure our mortall infirmities. Thou art the good ſhepheard, that cameſt to ſeeke vs wandering & loſt ſheepe; and to bring vs to thy fold againe. And more than that, thou art our brother; fleſh of our fleſh, and bone of our bones; which haſt taſted of our infirmities, felt our temptations, & borne the burden of our ſinnes. Therefore at thy hands we looke for mercie, againſt the daie of vengeance. And though thou puniſh vs, yet our hope is, and euer ſhall be, that thy rod ſhall no further touch vs, than ſhall make to thy glorie, our commoditie, and the ſtrengthening and increaſe of our faith.
                        Let this thy preaching ſundrie waies, O Lord, be ſufficient for our warning: and grant that we may ſpeedilie, and from the bottome of our harts repent, endeuour to doo thy righteous and bleſſed will reuealed in thy word; and frame our liues according to the ſame: that we may here liue in thy feare all the daies of our life, and after this our ſinfull courſe is ended, may dwell with thee in thy bleſſed kingdome, through the death and merits of Ieſus Chriſt our onelie redeemer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        A Pſalme of thankes-giuing for deliuerance from the plague, or anie other kind of ſickneſſe, trouble, or affliction.
                        
                           LOrd, thou art become gratious vnto thy land; thou haſt turned awaie the afflictions of thy ſeruants.
                        Thou haſt taken awaie all thy diſpleaſure, & turned thy ſelfe from thy wrathfull indignation.
                        For if thou, Lord, hadſt not helped vs; it had not failed, but our ſoules had beene put to ſilence.
                        But when we ſaid, Our feete haue ſlipped; thy mercie, O Lord, helped vs vp.
                        
                           
In the multitude of the ſorowes that we had in our harts, thy comforts haue refreſhed our ſoules.
                        Our ſoules waited ſtill vpon the Lord, our ſoules hanged vpon his helpe, our hope was alwaies in him.
                        In the Lords word did we reioice, in Gods word did we comfort our ſelues.
                        For the Lord ſaid; Call vpon me in the time of trouble, and I will heare thee, and thou ſhalt praiſe me.
                        So when we were poore, needie, ſicklie, and in heauineſſe, the Lord cared for vs; he was our helpe, and our ſauiour, according to his word.
                        In our aduerſitie and diſtreſſe he hath lifted vp our heads, and ſaued vs from vtter deſtruction.
                        He hath deliuered our ſoules from death, he hath fed vs in the time of dearth, he hath ſaued vs from the noiſome peſtilence.
                        Therefore will we offer in his holie temple the oblation of thankes-giuing, with great gladneſſe; wee will ſing and ſpeake praiſes vnto the Lord our Sauiour.
                        We will giue thanks vnto the Lord, for he is gratious, and his mercie endureth for euer.
                        The Lord is full of compaſſion and mercie, long ſuffering, plentious in goodneſſe and pitie.
                        His mercie is greater than the heauens, and his gratious goodneſſe reacheth vnto the clouds.
                        Like as a father pitieth his owne children; euen ſo is the Lord mercifull vnto them that feare him.
                        Therefore will we praiſe thee, and thy mercies, O God; vnto thee will we ſing, O thou holie one of Iſrael.
                        We will ſing a new ſong vnto thee, O God; we will praiſe the Lord with Pſalmes of thankes giuing.
                        O ſing praiſes, ſing praiſes vnto our God; O ſing praiſes, ſing praiſes vnto our King.
                        For God is the King of the earth, ſing praiſes with

vnderſtanding.
                        We will magnifie thee, O God our King; we will praiſe thy name for euer and euer.
                        Euerie daie will we giue thanks vnto thee, and praiſe thy name for euer and euer.
                        Our mouth ſhall ſpeake the praiſes of the Lord, and let all fleſh giue thanks to his holie name for euer and euer.
                        Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael for euer, and bleſſed be the name of his Maieſtie world without end,
                        Amen.
                        Glorie be to the Father, &c. As it was in the, &c.
                     
                     
                        In the time of anie particular or generall earthquake, praie:
                        
                        
                           OH eternall, mightie, and moſt louing Father; which haſt no deſire of the death of a ſinner; but that he conuert and liue; and vnto whom nothing is ſo pleaſant as the repentant, contrite, and ſorowfull hart of a penitent perſon. For thou art that kind father that falleſt moſt louinglie vpon the necke of the loſt ſonne; kiſſeſt, imbraceſt, and feaſteſt him, when he returneth from the puddle of pleaſures, and ſwill of the ſwine; and diſdaineſt not the repentant praier of thy poore and ſinfull ſeruants, whenſoeuer with true faith they returne and call vpon thee, as we haue moſt comfortable examples in Dauid, Manaſſes, Magdalen, Peter, and the theefe vpon the gibbet.
                        We moſt hartilie and humblie beſeech thy fatherlie goodneſſe, to looke downe from the throne of thy mercie-ſeate, vpon vs moſt miſerable and ſinfull ſlaues of Satan, which with fearfull and trembling harts doo quake and ſhake at the ſtrange and terrible tokens of

thy wrath and indignation, appearing moſt euidentlie vnto vs, by the ſhaking & moouing of the earth, which is thy footeſtoole; whereby (if we be not vtterlie deſtitute of grace) we be warned that thy cōming-downe amongſt vs, to viſit our ſinnes in moſt terrible maner, can not be farre off; ſeeing thou treadeſt ſo hard vpon this thy footeſtoole the earth, which we moſt ſhamefullie haue polluted and defiled, with our moſt wicked, ſinfull, and rebellious liues; notwithſtanding thy continuall crieng and calling vpon vs, by thy ſeruants the prophets and preachers, by whome we haue learned thy will; but haue not followed it. We haue heard much, and done little, yea nothing at all: but like moſt peruerſe and vnthankfull children, haue made a mocke of thy word, derided thy miniſters, and accounted thy threatenings trifles, and thy warnings of no weight or moment. Wherefore we haue iuſtlie deſerued to taſte moſt deeplie of the bitter cup of thine anger and bengeance, by wars, famine, peſtilence; yea and eternall death, if thou ſhouldeſt not temper the rigour of thy iuſtice with the mildneſſe of thy mercie. But ſuch is thy fatherlie affection towards vs, that thou ſheweſt thy ſelfe ſlowe to anger, long ſuffering, and of much patience and mercie; yea, thou art a thouſand times more readie to forget and forgiue, than we to aſke and require forgiueneſſe.
                        Therefore, though we be not woorthie of the leaſt mite of thy mercie; yet gratious Lord, looke not vpon vs and our ſinnes; but vpon thine owne ſelfe, and thy ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, the fountaine of grace, the treaſure of mercie, the ſalue of all ſickneſſe, the iewell of ioie, and the onlie hauen of ſuccour and ſafetie. By him we come to thee, in him and for him we truſt to find that we haue loſt, and gaine that he hath got. He is the ſcale of Iacob, by whom we climbe vp to thee; and thou by the Angels of thy mercie cōmeſt downe to vs.

Him we preſent vnto thee, and not we our ſelues; his death, and not our dooings; his bloudie wounds, and not our deteſtable deſeruings: whoſe merits are ſo great, as thy mercie cannot be little; and our ranſom ſo rich, that our beggerlie and beaſtlie ſinnes are nothing in thy ſight; for the great pleaſure and ſatiſfaction that thou takeſt of his paines and paſſion.
                        Turne this late earthquake, O Lord, to the benefite of thine elect, as thou didſt when thou ſhookeſt the priſon; looſedſt the locks, fetters and chaines of thy ſeruants Paule and Silas, and broughtſt them out of priſon, and conuertedſt their keeper: ſo gratious Lord, ſtrike the harts of tyrants with the terrour of this thy woorke, that they may knowe that they are but men; and that thou art that Samſon, that for their mocking and ſpiting of thee, and thy word, canſt ſhake the pillers of their palaces, and throwe them vpon the furious Philiſtines heads. Turne thy wrath, oh Lord, from thy children that call vpon thy name, to the conuerſion or confuſion of thine enimies, that deſpiſe and abhorre thy name, and deface thy glory. Thou haſt knocked long at their doores, but they will not open to let thee in. Burſt open therefore the braſen gates of their ſtonie harts, thou that art able of ſtones to raiſe vp children to Abraham. And finallie, ſo touch our harts with the finger of thy grace, that we maie deeply muſe vpon our ſinfull liues, to amend them; and call for thy mercie, to forgiue and pardon them; through Chriſt our Lord, who liueth with thee, and the holie Ghoſt, three perſons and one eternall God; to whome be all dominion and glorie, with praiſe and thanks-giuing, for euer and euer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        
                        Or elſe praie thus:
                        
                           O Almightie God, and moſt mercifull Father, which willeſt not the death of a ſinner; but rather that hee ſhould returne and liue: we thy ſeruants moſt humblie confeſſe, that we haue moſt greeuouſlie offended againſt thy diuine Maieſtie, and prouoked thy heauie wrath againſt vs, in that we haue not beleeued and folowed thy Goſpell preached vnto vs; nor beene thankfull for thy manie & verie great benefits beſtowed vpon vs: yea and being warned by the dangers of other, haue beene too careleſſe to ſerue thee, oh Lord, the Father of all mercie, and the God of all conſolation, which in thy wrath remembreſt mercie. We acknowledge, that in the late terrible earthquake, which ſuddenly ſhooke vs out of our houſes and dwelling places, thou didſt warne vs of thy iuſtice; and that we for our great vnthankfulneſſe and diſobedience, haue deſerued moſt iuſt iudgement. O Lord, we thy ſeruants, being vile earth, and miſerable ſinners; yet trembling and quaking at the remembrance of that terrible looke of thy wrathfull diſpleaſure neuer to be forgotten, moſt humblie craue pardon for our ſinnes; and grace to conuert vnto thee in time. Conuert vs, O Lord, and we ſhall be conuerted. Mollifie our hard harts, grant vs a contrite ſpirit, and to turne vnto thee vnfeinedlie, in faſting, weeping & praier. Enter not into iudgement with thy ſeruants; ſpare thy people, O Lord; ſpare them, and let not thine heritage be brought to confuſion. Haue mercie vpon vs, for thy ſonne Ieſus Chriſts ſake. Giue vs grace hencefoorth to amend our liues, and to ſerue thee in holines and righteouſneſſe. So we acknowledging thy iuſtice, and remembring alwaies that fearefull

ſigne of thy furie, in the memorable earthquake, which thou ſenteſt ye ſixt of Aprill, in the yeare one thouſand, fiue hundred, foureſcore; we ſhall praiſe thee for thy mercie, and glorifie thy holie name for euer, through Ieſus Chriſt our Sauiour,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        At the ſight of a blaſing ſtarre, or other meteors, or prodigious ſignes of Gods iudgment in the heauens, praie to preuent the euils foreſhewed thereby, and ſaie:
                        
                        
                           O Almightie Lord and God, whoſe workemanſhip is the whole world, the heauen and the earth, with all the beautie and bleſſings of the ſame; at the preſence of whoſe power all things doo quake and tremble; whoſe indignation when it threatneth vengeance vnto ſinners is vnſufferable, and whoſe promiſes of mercie are vnmeaſurable: bicauſe thou art euen the moſt high Lord ouer all the earth, full of patience, forbearance, pitie and repentance, ouer the wickedneſſe of ſinfull people, declaring the ſharpneſſe of thy iudgements for their amendment, and deliuerance from puniſhment. Thou, O Lord, haſt promiſed, according to thy bottomleſſe bountie and goodneſſe, a penitent ſpirit, not to iuſt and righteous Abraham, Iſaac and Iacob, which haue not offended againſt thy Maieſtie; but to thoſe that are ouerwhelmed with the tempeſtuous tides of their tranſgreſſions. We, O Lord, haue offended, and our fathers haue committed ſinne in thy ſight. We haue defiled our ſelues in the filthie puddle of iniquitie; and therefore beholding in the verie heauens, ſuch dreadfull tokens of thy wrathfull indignation hanging ouer our heads, for our monſtrous and prodigious life, we bow before thee the knees of our harts, beſeeching thee

to be gratious vnto vs, and to open thine eares to our praiers. We haue ſinned, O Lord; we haue ſinned, and we acknowledge our miſdeeds, humblie beſeeching thee to forgiue vs our offences. O forgiue vs, and deliuer vs not ouer to deſtruction with our iniquities, neither laie thou vp in ſtore vengeance againſt the daie of iudgement. O reſerue not for vs the whip of wo and wretchedneſſe; but in mercie pardon our miſdeeds: and let not the fierie flames of thy furie and wrath waxe hot againſt vs, to burne and conſume vs in our iniquities,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        In the time of warre.
                        
                           O Almightie God, King of all kings, and Gouernor of all things, whoſe power no creature is able to reſiſt, to whom it belongeth iuſtlie to puniſh ſinners, & to be mercifull vnto them that truelie repent; ſaue and deliuer vs, we humblie beſeech thee, from the hands of our enimies; abate their pride, aſſwage their malice, and confound their deuiſes; that we being armed with thy defence, may be preſerued euermore from all perils, to glorifie thee, which art the onlie giuer of all victorie; through the merits of thine onlie ſonne Ieſus Chriſt our Lord,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        In time of rebellion or inteſtine warre.
                        
                           O Moſt mightie and mercifull Lord God, which art King of glorie, and Lord of hoſts; the Gouernour of all creatures, the onlie giuer of all victories; who alone art able to ſtrengthen the weake againſt the mightie, and to vanquiſh infinite multitudes of thine enimies, with the

countenance of a few of thy ſeruants, calling vpon thy name, and truſting in thee; defend, O good Lord, thy ſeruants, and our gouernour vnder thee, our moſt gratious and ſouereigne Ladie Queene Elizabeth, and all hir faithfull ſubiects and people committed to hir charge. And eſpeciallie at this time, O Lord, haue regard to thoſe hir truſtie, louing, and obedient ſubiects; which be ſent into the north parts of this Realme; or ouer the ſeas, to the aid of ſuch as be perſecuted for the profeſſion of thy holie name, to withſtand the crueltie, force, and power of certaine falſe and vnfaithfull ſubiects: yea rather curſed rebels, and wicked traitours, and all thoſe which be common enimies, as well to the truth of thine eternall word, as to their owne naturall Prince and countrie; and manifeſtlie againſt the Crowne and Realme of England, which thou haſt by thy diuine prouidence aſſigned, in theſe our daies, to the gouernement of thy ſeruant our ſouereigne Ladie, and moſt gratious Queene; to the great comfort of all vs hir louing ſubiects, and faithfull commons: thy moſt glorious name be praiſed therefore.
                        O Lord God of hoſts, which by thine Angel therevnto appointed, dooſt miniſter both warre and peace; and which diddeſt giue vnto Dauid both courage and ſtrength, being but a little one, vnarmed, and vnexpert in feates of warre, with his ſling to ſet vpon, & ouerthrowe the great huge giant Goliah: our cauſe now being iuſt, and being forced to enter into warre and battell, we moſt humblie beſeech thee, moſt gratious God, ſo to turne the harts of theſe rebels, thine and our enimies, to the deſire of peace, that no Chriſtian bloud be ſhed or ſpilt. Or elſe grant, O Lord, that with ſmall effuſion of bloud, and to the little hurt and damage of thy ſeruants, who doo ieopard their liues for the defence of thy holie Goſpell, our Queene, & Realme, againſt the aduerſaries thereof, we may to thy glorie

obteine the victorie, and that the warres being ended, the rebels ſoone put to flight and vanquiſhed, we may all with one hart and mind knit togither, in godlie concord and vnitie, laud & praiſe thee which art our God.
                        O moſt mercifull Father, if it be thy holie will, make ſoft and tender the ſtonie harts of all thoſe, I ſaie, that exalt themſelues againſt thy truth, and ſeeke either to trouble the quietneſſe of this Realme of England, or to oppreſſe the Crowne of the ſame, and conuert them to the knowledge of thy ſonne, the onelie Sauiour of the world Ieſus Chriſt, that we and they may iointlie glorifie thy mercies. Lighten, we beſeech thee, their ignorant harts, to embrace the truth of thy word, or elſe to abate their crueltie, O moſt mightie Lord; that this our Chriſtian Region, with others that confeſſe thy holie Goſpell, may obteine by thine aid & ſtrength, ſuertie from all our enimies, without ſhedding of Chriſtian and innocent bloud; whereby all they, which be in feare of their crueltie, may be comforted: and finallie, that all Chriſtian realmes, and eſpeciallie this Realme of England, may by thy defence and protection continue in the truth of the Goſpell, and enioie perfect peace, quietneſſe, and ſecuritie; and that we, for theſe thy mercies, iointlie all together, with one conſent, hart, and voice, may thankfullie render vnto thee all laud and praiſe; that we knit in one godlie concord and vnitie among our ſelues, may continuallie magnifie thy glorious name.
                        And furthermore, for as much as it is thy good will and pleaſure, to appoint vs in the number of ſubiects; we moſt humblie beſeech thee, O heauenlie Father, to giue vs faithfull and obedient harts vnto our dread ſouereigne Ladie the Queenes moſt excellent Maieſtie, and to the high powers and godlie rulers, that are in authoritie vnder hir noble Grace, that there may be found in vs no diſobedience, no vnfaithfulnes,

no treaſon, no falſehood, no diſſimulation, no inſurrection, no commotion, no conſpiracie; nor anie kind of rebellion, in deede, word, or thought: but all faithfulneſſe, obedience, quietneſſe, ſubiection, and humilitie; and whatſoeuer elſe becommeth faithfull ſubiects, vnder ſo good and ſo gratious a Prince: that we liuing heere in all lowlineſſe of mind, may at the laſt daie, through thy fauour, be lifted vp into euerlaſting glorie; where thou, O moſt mercifull Father, with thy ſonne, and the holie Ghoſt, liueſt and reigneſt one verie true and perfect God, for euer and euer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        A thankes-giuing for the ſuppreſsion of rebellion, or inſurrection.
                        
                        
                           O Heauenlie and moſt mercifull Father, the defender of thoſe that put their truſt in thee; the ſure fortreſſe of all them that flie to thee for ſuccour; who of thy moſt iuſt iudgements, for our diſobedience and rebellion againſt thy holie word, and for our holie profeſſion, whereby we haue giuen occaſion that thy holie name hath beene blaſphemed among the ignorant, haſt of late yeeres ſore abaſhed the whole Realme & people of England, with the terrour and danger of rebellion, thereby to awake vs out of our dead ſleepe of careleſſe ſecuritie; and haſt yet by the miſeries following the ſame rebellion, moſt ſharpelie puniſhed part of our countriemen, and Chriſtian brethren, who haue moſt neerelie fealt the ſame: and moſt dreadfullie haſt ſcourged ſome of the ſeditious perſons with terrible executions, iuſtlie inflicted for their diſobedience to thee, and to thy ſeruant their Souereigne, to the example of vs all, and to the warning, correction,

and amendment of thy ſeruants; of thine accuſtomed goodneſſe turning alwaies the wickedneſſe of euill men, to the profit of them that feare thee; who in thy iudgements remembring thy mercie, haſt by thine aſſiſtance giuen the victorie to thy ſeruant the Queene, hir Nobilitie, and faithfull Subiects, with ſo little, or rather no effuſion of Chriſtian bloud; as alſo might iuſtlie haue enſued, to the exceeding comfort of all ſorrowfull Chriſtian harts; and that of thy fatherlie pitie and mercifull goodneſſe onelie, and euen for thine owne name ſake, without anie our deſert at all.
                        Wherefore, we render vnto thee moſt humble and hartie thanks, for theſe thy great mercies ſhewed vnto vs, who had deſerued ſharper puniſhment; moſt humblie beſeeching thee, to grant vnto vs all that confeſſe thy holie name, and profeſſe the true and perfect Religion of thy holie Goſpell, thy heauenlie grace, to ſhew our ſelues in our liuing, according to our profeſſion; that we trulie knowing thee in thy bleſſed word, may obedientlie walke in thy holie commandements; and that we being warned by this thy fatherlie correction, doo prouoke thy iuſt wrath againſt vs no more, but may enioie the continuance of thy great mercies towards vs; thy right hand, as in this, ſo in all other inuaſions, rebellions, and dangers, continuallie ſauing and defending our Church, our Realme, our Queene, and people of England; that all our poſterities enſuing, confeſſing thy holie name, profeſſing thy holie Goſpell, and leading a holie life, may perpetuallie praiſe and magnifie thee, with thy onlie ſonne Ieſus Chriſt our ſauiour, and the holie Ghoſt; to whome be all laud, praiſe, glorie, and empire, for euer and euer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        
                        In time of extreame troubles, by reaſon of the tyrannie of ſtrange and forraigne gouernours.
                        
                        
                           ETternall and euerlaſting God, father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, thou that ſheweſt mercie, and keepeſt couenant with them that loue thee, and in reuerence keepe thy commandments, euen when thou powreſt foorth thy hot diſpleaſure, and iuſt iudgements vpon the obſtinate and inobedient: we heere proſtrate our ſelues before the throne of thy Maieſtie, from our harts confeſſing, that iuſtlie thou dooeſt puniſh vs, by the tyrannie of ſtrangers; and that more iuſtlie thou maiſt bring vpon vs againe, the bondage and the yoke, which of thy mercie, for a ſeaſon, thou haſt remoued. Our kings, princes and people, in blindneſſe haue refuſed the word of thine eternall veritie; and in ſo dooing we haue refuſed the league of thy mercie offered vnto vs againe, in ſuch aboundance, that none can be excuſed by reaſon of ignorance. Yet neuertheleſſe, to the iudgement of men, impietie ouerfloweth the whole face of this Realme. For the great multitude delight themſelues in ignorance and idolatrie. And ſuch (alas) as appeere to reuerence and embrace thy word, doo not expreſſe the fruits of repentance, as it becommeth the people, to whome thou haſt ſhewed thy ſelfe ſo mercifull and fauourable.
                        Theſe are thy iuſt iudgements, O Lord, whereby thou puniſheſt ſinne by ſinne, and man by his owne iniquitie; ſo that there can be no end of ſinne, except thou preuent vs with thy vndeſerued grace. Conuert vs therefore, O Lord, and we ſhall be conuerted. Suffer not our vnthankefulneſſe to procure, of thy moſt iuſt iudgments, that ſtrangers againe haue empire aboue

vs; neither yet that the light of thy Goſpell bee taken from vs: but howſoeuer it be, that the great multitude be altogether rebellious, and alſo that in vs there remaine perpetuall imperfections; yet for the glorie of thine owne name, and for the glorie of thine onlie begotten ſonne Ieſus Chriſt (whoſe truth and Goſpell, thou of thy meere mercie haſt manifeſted among vs) it will pleaſe thee, to take vs into thy protection and defence; that all the world may know, that as of thy mercie thou haſt begun this worke of our ſaluation, by the publiſhing and preaching of thy Goſpell among vs; ſo of this ſame mercie, thou wilt continue it, maugre the heads of all our malicious enimies. Grant vs this, mercifull father, for Chriſt Ieſus thy ſonnes ſake: So be it.
                        
                     
                     
                        A thanks-giuing, after our deliuerance from the tyrannie of ſtrange enimies; with praier for continuance of peace betwixt Realmes.
                        
                           NOW, Lord, ſeeing that we enioie comfort, both in bodie and in ſpirit, by reaſon of this quietneſſe of thy mercie, granted vnto vs, after our moſt deſperate troubles, in the which we appered vtterlie to haue beene ouerwhelmed: we praiſe and glorifie thy mercie and goodneſſe, who pitiouſlie lookedſt vpon vs, when we in our ſelues were vtterlie confounded. But ſeeing, O Lord, that to receiue benefits at thy hands, and not to be thankefull for the ſame, is nothing elſe but a ſeale againſt vs, in the daie of iudgement; wee moſt humblie beſeech thee, to grant vnto vs harts ſo mindfull of the calamitie paſt, that we may continuallie feare to prouoke thy iuſtice, to puniſh vs with the like or worſſe plagues. And ſeeing that, when we by our owne power were

altogether vnable, to haue freed our ſelues from the tyrannie of ſtrangers, and from the bondage & thraldome pretended againſt vs; that of thine eſpeciall goodneſſe, didſt moue the harts of our neighbours, of whome we had not deſerued ſo much fauour, to take vpon them the common burthen with vs; and for our deliuerance, not onlie to ſpend the liues of manie, but alſo to hazard the ſtate & tranquillitie of their Realme and Common-wealth. Grant vnto vs, O Lord, that with ſuch reuerence we may remember thy benefits receiued, that after this in our default, we neuer enter into hoſtilitie againſt thoſe Realmes and Nations.
                        Suffer vs neuer, O Lord, to fall to that ingratitude, and deteſtable vnthankefulneſſe, that we ſhould ſeeke the deſtruction and death of thoſe, whome thou haſt made inſtruments to deliuer vs from the tyrannie of mercileſſe ſtrangers. Diſſipate thou the counſelles of ſuch, as deceiptfullie trauell to ſtir vp the harts of the inhabitants of either Realme againſt the other. Let their malicious practiſes be their owne confuſion; and grant of thy mercie, that loue, concord, and tranquillitie may continue and encreaſe among the inhabitants of both Realmes; eſpeciallie of this Iſle of England, euen till the comming of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt; by whoſe glorious Goſpell, thou of thy mercie dooeſt call vs both to vnitie, peace, and Chriſtian concord; the full perfection whereof we ſhall poſſeſſe in the fulneſſe of thy kingdome, when all offences ſhall be remooued, iniquitie ſhall be ſuppreſſed, and thy choſen children be fullie endued with that perfect glorie, in the which now our Lord Ieſus Chriſt reigneth: to whome, with thee, O father, and the holie Ghoſt, be all honour, praiſe and glorie, now and euer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        
                        In time of inuaſion by the Turke and Infidels, that make warre in anie part of Christendome; praie and that earneſtlie, as followeth.
                        
                           OMnipotent and eternall God, father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt; maker, preſeruer, and mainteiner both of heauen and earth, together with thy coeternall ſonne, and the holie Ghoſt: we haue ſinned, O Lord, with our fathers; we haue done amiſſe, and dealt wickedlie; and therfore we confeſſe, that by thy righteous iudgements we are iuſtlie puniſhed, and haue trulie deſerued, that barbarous nations, and cruell Turks, making inuaſion into Chriſtendome, ſhould ſpoile vs of our goods, ouerthrowe Schooles, Churches, Common-weales; make pitifull hauocke of the promiſcuous, mixt, or confuſed multitude of ſillie weake people, as they were ſheepe prepared to the ſhambles, and carrie miſerable men from the ſweet boſoms of their deere freends, into far and barbarous nations, to a ſlauerie more greeuous than death.
                        O God, it is thou which haſt repelled vs, yea thou makeſt vs a ſhame to the nations for our ſinnes, and goeſt not foorth to war with our armies. Thou makeſt vs to turne our backs vpon our enimies, ſo that they which hate vs, ſpoile our goods. Thou letteſt vs to bee eaten like ſheepe, and haſt ſcattered vs among the heathen. Thou ſelleſt thy people for naught, and takeſt no monie for them. Therefore he the heathen come into thine inheritance; thy holie Temple haue they defiled; they haue deſtroied our townes and houſes, and brought them into an heape of ſtones. The dead bodies of thy ſeruants haue they giuen to be meate to the fowles of the aire; and the fleſh of thy Saincts,

vnto the beaſts of the land. Their bloud haue they ſhed like water on euerie ſide, and there was no man to burie them. We are become an open ſhame to our enimies, a verie ſcorne and deriſion vnto them that are round about vs.
                        O Lord, in theſe miſchieuous warres, and in the middeſt of fatall or mortall puniſhments, which threaten an horrible mutation of worldlie empires, we flie vnto thee, ſaieng; Helpe vs, O God of our ſaluation; for the glorie of thy name. O deliuer vs, and be mercifull vnto our ſinnes. O Lord deale not with vs according to our ſinnes, neither reward vs after our iniquities; but haue mercie vpon vs, and that ſoone; for we are come to great miſerie. Looke vpon our aduerſitie and miſerie, and forgiue vs all our ſinnes. Conſider our enimies how manie they be, and they beare a tyrannicall hate againſt vs. Thou which aforetime didſt remit the offences of thy people, diddeſt couer all their ſinnes, and didſt turne awaie thine heauie indignation from them; turne vs, we humblie beſeech thee, O God our Sauiour, and remooue awaie thy diſpleaſure from vs alſo, that in true repentance wee may pleaſe thee, for thy ſonne Chriſts ſake. Wilt thou be diſpleaſed at vs for euer? Or wilt thou ſtretch thy wrath from one generation to another? Oh let the ſorowfull ſighing of the priſoners come before thee, according to the greatneſſe of thy power; preſerue thou thoſe that are appointed to die.
                        Powre out thine indignation rather vpon the heathen that haue not knowne thee, and vpon the kingdoms that haue not called vpon thy name; that all nations may knowe that thou takeſt vengeance of the bloud of thy ſeruants that is ſhed. Conſider the mortall threatenings of our enimies, that they exerciſe not their crueltie vpon vs, and ſaie triumphantlie; Where is now their God? Keepe from our necks the

greeuous yoke of the Turkiſh bondage, and repreſſe the furiouſneſſe of all tyrants, which labour to ſpoile, and make hauocke of thy Church; to aboliſh true doctrine, praiers, and pure religion; that they may bring in paganiſme, and build vp idolatrie, errours, and blaſphemous ceremonies.
                        Defend our Churches, our politike gouernance, our Schooles and Uniuerſities, our cities and dwelling places. Suffer not (good ſtudies, learning, religion, and lawes being ouerthrowne) theſe our townes to be reduced into ſtables, for ſauage Mahomets, Turkiſh tyrants, or other bloudie tyrants, which hate thee and vs extremelie. Arme the right arme of our gratious Queene, and hir Nobles (as alſo all other Chriſtian Emperours, Kings, and Potentates) that they may fight for our lawes, liues, and libertie. Teach their hands to warre, and their fingers to fight. Increaſe in them an inuincible courage of mind, that inflamed through the zeale of thy religion, they may valiantlie withſtand the Turks, which are the mortall enimies of thy deere Sonne, and of his Church.
                        Guide thou the hands of ſuch as doo fight in the cauſe of thy religion, and grant them happie ſucceſſe ouer all their enimies. For a king is not preſerued by his great armie, and a giant ſhall not be ſaued by the multitude of his hoſt, nor warlike ſtrength: but the victorie proceedeth from the heauens. At thy rebuke, O God, the chariot and horſes fall downe. Thou ſhalt take awaie the courage of princes, and art terrible vnto the kings of the earth. O be thou our helpe in trouble, for vaine is the helpe of man. Through thee, O mightie Iehoua, we ſhall doo great acts, and thou wilt tread our enimies vnder thy feet, that they come to naught; through our Lord Ieſus Chriſt,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        
                        A thanks-giuing vnto God, for the Chriſtians victorie had against the Turks.
                        
                        
                           
                              O
                            Mercifull Father, O Lord God of hoſts, the onelie protector and defender of thine heritage; againſt whome, no might, no power, nor counſell can preuaile; who of thy great mercie, without our merit or deſeruing, haſt at all times protected & defended vs, from the cruell hand of our enimies, and mightilie deliuered vs, euen out of the mouth of the roring Lion: we yeeld vnto thee, O father, for theſe thy great goodneſſes and mercies, moſt humble & hartie thanks; and eſpeciallie, O father, we praiſe thy holie name, that at this preſent thou haſt ſaued and deliuered thy people, from the great aſſaults and dangers of that ſame profeſſed & mightie enimie of Chriſtian Religion, the Turke; and alſo haſt giuen vnto the people, which fought thy battels, battelled vnder thy banner, and truſted onlie in thy helpe, ſo great and notable a victorie: for the which O Lord God, we doo laud and magnifie thy holie name for euer, through Chriſt our Captaine, Redeemer, and Sauiour; beſeeching thee, for thy mercifull goodneſſe, that thou wouldeſt ſheeld vs vnder thy mightie protection for euer, that we hauing the fruition of godlie peace, through thy mercie, may the reſt of theſe few daies which we haue to liue, lead a peaceable and a quiet life, in all pietie and honeſtie, through Chriſt our Lord, to whome, with thee, and the holie Ghoſt, be all honour, glorie, and praiſe, for euer and euer, Amen.
                        
                        
                           O God, whoſe nature and propertie is euer to haue mercie, and to forgiue; receiue our humble petitions. And though we be tied and bound with the chaine of our ſinnes, yet let the pitifulneſſe of thy great mercie looſe vs, for the honour of Ieſus Chriſtes ſake, our onlie mediator and aduocate,
                        Amen.
                     
                     The end of the Letanie.
                  
                  
                     
                     Praiers to be vſed before and after the firſt and ſecond leſſons, the Goſpell and Piſtle: and before and after the Sermon or Homilie.
                     
                     
                        Before the firſt or ſecond leſſon, praie:
                        
                           BLeſſed Lord, which haſt cauſed all holie Scriptures, both in the old and new Teſtaments, to be written and red for our learning; grant vs, that we may now in ſuch ſort heare them, reade them, marke, learne, and inwardlie digeſt them, that by patience and comfort of thy holie word, we may embrace, and euer hold faſt the bleſſed hope of euerlaſting life, which thou haſt giuen vs in our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt,
                        Amen.

                           GRatious God, and moſt mercifull father, which haſt vouchſafed vs the rich and pretious iewell of thy holie word; aſſiſt vs with thy ſpirit, that it may be written in our harts, to our euerlaſting comfort; to reforme vs, to renew vs, according to thine owne image; to build vs vp, and edifie vs into the perfect building of thy Chriſt, ſanctifieng and increaſing in vs all heauenlie vertues. Grant this, O heauenlie father, for Ieſu Chriſts ſake,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Or thus:
                        
                           THanks be vnto thee, O our celeſtiall father, through Chriſt our Redeemer; that thou haſt ſo cleerelie by thy Patriarchs, Prophets and Apoſtls, reuealed vnto vs theſe ſo ſecret myſteries

of our ſaluation in Chriſt; for whoſe ſake alſo, we beſeech thee, to giue vs the verie feare and faith in thee; that we conſtantlie beleeuing thy truth, and following that thou commandeſt vs in thy word, may by no meanes hinder thy glorie, or the courſe of thy word, by our lewd conuerſation, but in all obedience helpe to amplifie and increaſe thy kingdome, to the perpetuall praiſe of thy name, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Before the reading of the Epiſtle or Goſpell, praie.
                        
                           ALmightie God, and moſt mercifull Father, who by thy holie ſpirit in thy ſeruants the Apoſtles, and the Euangeliſts, haſt left vnto vs the ſtorie of the doctrine and deedes of our Sauiour Chriſt, that thereby, as he is in deede, ſo we might beleeue him to be thy Sonne, and the Sauiour of the world, & put our truſt in thee through him; that ſo beleeuing, we might attaine to euerlaſting life: grant vs, we beſeech thee, the ſame moſt holie ſpirit to open our harts, and lighten our minds, that by the reading and hearing of the ſame, our faith in thee, through him, may continuallie be ſtrengthened, till we attaine to the end thereof, euen the ſaluation of our ſoules, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord and Sauiour,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        After the reading of the Epiſtle or Goſpell.
                        
                           WE giue thee thanks, moſt mercifull Father, for that it hath pleaſed thee in great mercie towards vs, to cauſe the holie writings and traditions of the Apoſtles and Euangeliſts, to come to this our time, place, and eares; & that thou haſt vouchſafed

alſo to open & reueale thy holie will vnto them, to approue thy ſonne ſo manifeſtlie to the world, and to confirme vnto vs by them the truth of thy Goſpell, that in the mouth of ſo manie faithfull witneſſes, we might haue more full aſſurance in thy mercifull promiſes. Helpe vs O good Father we beſeech thee, that by thy grace we may doo in deede, that which we now by them doo vnderſtand. And leaſt heerein we be, through thy iuſtice, more greeuouſlie condemned and puniſhed, if that we neglect to doo thy will, which through thy grace thou haſt reuealed; graunt vs the fruit of this thy care towards vs, in the ſtrength of faith, that hauing read and heard ſo notable things in this his holie ſtorie, and acts and writings of the holie Apoſtles, recorded and left vnto vs by ſo true and moſt faithfull witneſſes, appointed and ordeined therevnto by thee; we may now, by the effectuall working of thy holie ſpirit, receiue and acknowledge him for thine onlie ſonne, and our onlie ſauiour, to the ſaluation of our ſoules, and the glorious praiſe of thy name; and ſo being lead from one witneſſe to another, we may, according to thy holie word, go from faith to faith, till we atteine to the euerlaſting life, which thou haſt prepared for vs in thy ſonne: to whome with thee; O Father, and the holie Ghoſt, be all honor, glorie, and praiſe, both now and for euer,
                        Amen.

                           FOR as much, O moſt mercifull God, as faith, without the which it is impoſſible to pleaſe thee in anie thing we doo, commeth by hearing; and hearing by the word of God: in ſo much as he or ſhe that turneth awaie his eare frō hearing the lawe, euen his praier ſhall be abhominable, and turned into ſinne: yea, bicauſe alſo it is a farre more bleſſed thing to heare and keepe thy word, than to haue had the honour to haue borne or nurſed thine owne ſonne: grant vs grace therefore, I moſt humblie beſeech thee, in zeale and loue to doo this one thing, ſo acceptable a ſeruice to thee, and moſt needfull for vs to be done; euen with attentiue and deſirous minds to heare thy holie word preached, and ſo farre to exceed the Queene of Saba, and thoſe which haue ſought for wiſdome from the vttermoſt parts of the earth, as the wiſdome thou offereſt vs in it exceedeth all other: and ſo much more redilie to practiſe it, than they did, which heard thy Prophets; as thy ſonne is aboue all the Prophets, that we with wiſe Martha making our choiſe, by thy grace, of the better part, may be made wiſe in him vnto ſaluation, and it neuer be taken from vs; but remaine with vs, till it put vs in poſſeſſion of that happie life, which in a bleſſed hope we looke for by it. And grant vs ſo to be carefull ouer our dutie, which thou haſt commanded, that wee eſpeciallie regarding that which is chiefeſt with thee, and moſt needfull for our ſelues; may therby declare our ſelues to be in deed of God, bicauſe we heare Gods word; and to be the true ſheepe of thy fold, bicauſe we harken diligentlie to thy voice, and followe thee with Suſanna, Ioanna,

Marie Magdalen, and all other godlie men and women: and ſo by this meanes finallie not faile of thy promiſes; but obteine, to our endleſſe comfort, and the glorie of thy name, the bleſſing and gift of eternall life, among all faithfull beleeuers, in the kingdome of heauen, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another verie Chriſtian praier both of the preacher and auditorie preſent.
                        
                        
                           OH Lord, how beautifull are the feete of them that bring the glad tidings of the Goſpell of peace, of ſaluation, & of all good things! Surelie, without preaching we ſhould all periſh. Bleſſed and praiſed be thou therefore, O Father, for that thou haſt giuen to vs thy Goſpell, life, foode, doctrine and peace in our time. Bleſſed and praiſed be thou therefore, O Chriſt, bicauſe thou giueſt and reneweſt often the light of thy Goſpell, and maitaineſt the miniſters of thy word; and preſerueſt, cheriſheſt, and defendeſt thy catholike Church, againſt the diuell, and all thine enimies. Yea bleſſed, I ſaie, and praiſed alſo be thou therefore, O holie ſpirit; bicauſe thou being powred vpon the Apoſtles, dooeſt now alſo kindle thy light in our harts, ruleſt, inſtructeſt, admoniſheſt, helpeſt vs, gouerneſt and guideſt o
                              ••
                            labours to a proſperous end, and ſanctifieſt vs to eternall life.
                        And now, for as much as the chiefe authoritie of ſpeaking, is indeed of thee, O Lord alone, (for a mortall man hath but a dead hart,) I humblie beſeech thee to bleſſe this thy preacher heere preſent, with thy diuine grace; that he may doo the worke of an Euangeliſt, and make thy Goſpell knowne vnto vs. Giue vnto him the ſpirit of feare, godlineſſe, fortitude, counſell, zeale, knowledge, diſcretion, wiſedome, vnderſtanding, and

conſtancie; and let him, as he hath receiued thy gifts, ſo (like a good and faithfull diſpoſer of thy manifold graces) trulie miniſter the ſame vnto vs. Lord, let him come vnto vs with abundant knowledge, and abilitie of the diuine myſteries of the bleſſings of the Goſpell of Chriſt, to communicate and impart vnto vs. And now that he is about to ſpeake, grant that he may ſpeake in thee; that is, by thy helpe and grace: and as he is allowed of thee, ſo to vtter the words of God, as he hath receiued them from thee, that thou in althings maiſt be glorified. Put vpon his hart the breaſt-plate of perfect iudgement, the Urim of knowledge, and the Thumim of holines and righteouſnes of life, and puritie of doctrine. Let thy word be in his hart, as a burning fire ſhut vp in his bones; yea let his bellie be as the wine, which hath no vent; or like the new bottles that burſt: that being full of good matter, thy ſpirit within may compell him to ſpeake his mind effectuallie. Yea, doo thou, O Lord, I ſaie, ſecretlie ſpeake and worke in him; and let thy ſecret power and vertue be put here vnto this action, to this his labour and exerciſe of faith, that he may accompliſh that thou requireſt to be done, for the conuerſion and ſaluation of thy people preſent. Giue him the earneſt-penie of thy ſpirit in his hart, and open the doore of vtterance vnto him; that he may make manifeſt the ſauour of thy life and knowledg; vnto vs. Lord, thou haſt ſaid; Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it. Open thou therefore his lips, that his mouth may ſhew forth thy praiſe; and ſhew vs the waie, wherein we may walke ſtraight to thee. O let his mouth, I ſaie, be filled with thy praiſe, that he may preach thine vndefiled lawe, to the conuerting of ſoules, and giue wiſdome to the ſimple, and light to the blind. Let vtterance be giuen now vnto him, that he may open his mouth boldlie, to publiſh the ſecrets of the Goſpell, whereof he is an Ambaſſadour;

that therein he may ſpeake boldlie, as he ought to ſpeake, not ſparing anie man, nor hauing regard to pleaſe anie maner of perſon. Touch thou, O God, the mouth of this thy preacher, with the hot glowing cole of thy ſpirit, whereby he being firſt clenſed, may the more feruentlie and purelie preach thy Goſpell vnto his brethren, in the diſcharge of his dutie, as he that firſt is mooued with the zeale of thy glorie, and then touched with a carefull affection towards thy people, as Eſaie was. Giue vnto this thy preacher the audacitie of Eliah & Iohn Baptiſt, that like the true miniſter of God, he may ſtoutlie & boldlie, without anie reſpect of perſons, or deſire to pleaſe men, as he that feareth God more than the faces of men, reproue the people of their ſinnes. Let him, as thou haſt giuen in commendement, crie alowd, and ſpare not: let him lift vp his voice like a trumpet, and with all diligence and diſcretion ſhew thy people their tranſgreſſions, and reprooue vice vnfeinedlie. And bicauſe, O Lord, in vaine ſhall he caſt the net of thy word, except thou bleſſe the draught; and his labour yeeld no profit, vnleſſe thou proſper it; doo thou therefore luckilie ſet him on: looſe thou his tongue, to ſpeake; and put thou into his hart what to ſaie. Bleſſe him, that thy word may be with him; that he may be able thoroughlie to inſtruct vs what is thy will, that he may catch our ſoules, and by thy ſecret & diuine power drawe vnto him the harts, minds, and eares of the hearers: ſo ſhall he conuert and win manie vnto thy Chriſt, and thou thereby be highlie glorified. Let thy ſpirit ſpeake by him, and thy words be in his tongue; that he vtter nothing raſhlie, or vndiſcreetlie; but by the motion of thy good ſpirit, ſpeaking ſincerelie and holilie of thee, as in thy ſight. Giue to him, and to all ſuch as beare thy word, and are the miniſters of the ſpirituall life, ſuch care, zeale, and diligence, that they may indeuour faithfullie and painfullie

to fulfill their office, to the vttermoſt. And finallie, let him not defile the euangelicall function by anie meanes, no not with the leaſt ſuſpicion of glorie or lucre; neither let his mouth ſpeake wickedneſſe, nor his tongue ſet foorth deceit: but as he dooth preach thy lawes, and take thy couenant in his mouth; ſo grant he himſelfe alſo may not hate to be reformed, nor at anie time caſt thy holie word behind his backe.
                        And now, bicauſe thou, O Lord, ſo mercifullie offereſt vnto vs thy ſaluation; I am to deſire thee furthermore, in the behalfe of this congregation preſent, that we alſo, for our parts, may of our owne accord willinglie receiue the ſame ſaluation of the Goſpell, now ſo gratiouſlie offered vs: that as thy preachers, for their parts, doo publiſh thy glorious name: ſo we, as greene graſſe, may receiue the heauenlie dew of thy doctrine: and that the barren earth of our harts, may be thereby moiſtened with the liuelie water of thy grace, and holie ſpirit, to fructifie in the ſame. Grant that we may receiue theſe holie things, high myſteries, and moſt pretious pearles, not as dogs, or ſwine, to tread them contemptuouſlie vnder our feete; as wicked Atheiſts, and vngodlie contemners of thy Goſpell, to our damnation: but as thy children, and thoſe that are of God, and ſheepe of his fold, with all meekneſſe, obedience, chriſtian feare and reuerence, grant that we may both heare, receiue, and fulfill them; to thy glorie, and our ſaluation. Furthermore, as thou in mercie openeſt their mouth to ſpeake vnto vs; ſo giue vs grace to open our harts and eares, to receiue the wholeſome inſtructions, and fatherlie admonitions, which proceed thereout. O giue vs grace, I ſaie, to applie our harts to inſtruction, and our eares to the words of knowledge. Let vs be ſtill deſirous of thy heauenlie kingdome. Let the holie bread of thy Goſpell, and foode of heauenlie dainties, be onlie ſweet vnto vs, and ſauorie

in our mouths; that we may depart well refreſhed, and full fraught with the largeſſe and plentie of thy word, and Euangelike feaſt. Make thou vs true Conuerts, and more and more to increaſe and growe from faith to faith, & vertue to vertue. Let vs neuer loath this heauenlie Philoſophie; but let vs be as the learned, that are taught of thee, and made meet by this thy preacher to receiue thy doctrine to our health. The preacher heere preſent is vndoubtedlie thy mouth and meſſenger, whom thou haſt ſent. O therfore let vs not dare either barbarouſly to miſvſe our ſelues towards him, in word, deed, or thought; or ſcornefullie diſdaine to be taught of him: but with all feare of thy Maieſtie, and reuerence towards him, let vs with all attentiue and ghoſtlie greedineſſe marke his words well, to followe whatſoeuer ſhall be godlie vttered by him. And finallie, touch thou ſo our harts, we beſeech thee, O God, to beleeue thy word, and to repent with ſpeed, that the preaching of thy Goſpell may take place in vs, to practiſe the works of faith, and ſhew foorth fruits worthie the ſame; ſo that we, with this and all other thy preachers, and they togither with vs, leading a right, vertuous, and godlie life, according to the rules preſcribed in thy word, may be brought in the end vnto thee, the chiefe ſhepheard of our ſoules; where wee may iointlie be partakers of eternall good things, and moſt excellent felicitie, thorough Ieſus Chriſt our Lord,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another.
                        
                           IN this great darkneſſe of our ſoules, O Lord, thou ſhineſt vnto vs with the lightſome lampe of thy grace: but in nothing ſo effectuallie as in preaching of thy word. Great is the harueſt, as thou thy ſelfe haſt ſaid; and the workemen

are few. The moſt part of men are ignorant, and wrapped in miſerable blindneſſe; and few there are that teach thy word trulie, and as they ought. I beſeech thee therefore, that thou wilt ſend foorth workemen into thy harueſt: ſend teachers, O Lord, which are taught of thee, and inſtructed by thy ſpirit of godlie wiſdome and vnderſtanding, which by their preaching will ſeeke not themſelues, but thee, becauſe they are godlie; and can ſo doo, becauſe they are wiſe, and vnderſtand. Giue to the preacher of thy word heere preſent, out of the treaſures of thy wiſedome, that which he may powre vpon vs to our ſaluation. And in vs open the windowes of our harts, that they may receiue into them the moſt holie and wholſome light; and that the good ſeede, which falleth vpon vs, be not choaked with thornes, or withered awaie with drought, nor be deuoured by the fowles of the aire; but may growe vp in good ground, and that fruitefullie with great increaſe, to thy glorie, and our ſaluation,
                        Amen.

                           I Giue thee moſt hartie thanks, O eternall God, father of our Lord Ieſu Chriſt; for that it hath pleaſed thee, of thine vnſpeakable mercie and goodneſſe, in all ages, continuallie to ſend into the world, men woonderfull in the gifts and knowledge of thy will, to be renuers and ſpreaders foorth of thy truth. Like thanks I aſcribe vnto thy ſacred Maieſtie, for allowing vs ſhepheards and preachers, in theſe our daies, for the gathering together of thy Church out of all mankinde, to the building of the bodie of Chriſt. Humblie I beſeech thee, gratious God, continue alwaie among vs thy pure

word, through thy Miniſters; gather vnto thy ſelfe an euerlaſting congregation, and ſo inſtruct mine hart with thy ſpirit of truth, that vnfeinedlie I may aſſent to thy wholeſome word, proue a liuelie member of thy bodie, and be incorporated into that ſocietie, which both in this world doth ſincerelie confeſſe thee, and euermore extoll thy holie name.
                        Keepe thoſe preachers, which thou dooeſt and wilt giue, in the certaine knowledge of thy bleſſed will, that they may from time to time both open vnto vs thine intent, concerning the repairing of mankind, the ſaluation and redemption of our ſoules, through thy free mercy, and alſo teach vs how to liue in new obedience, and to abſtaine from carnall deſires, which fight againſt the ſoule. Inſpire the miniſters and preachers of thy word, with thine holie ſpirit, that they may vtter thy will purelie, as they haue receiued it from thy hands, reteining the forme of whoalſome words, and ſounding onlie that doctrine, which is vttered by thy ſonne out of thy boſome. For otherwiſe, departing from the order of faith, and the rule of thy word, they will greatlie obſcure the light of thy doctrine, and obtrude vpon vs the vanitie of their owne inuentions. Wherefore let them ſpeake thy word, not deceiptfullie, but ſincerelie, euen as from thee, and in thy ſight.
                        Grant alſo, that by tranſforming thy miniſterie into policie, they lord not ouer thine elect, neither contend about ſuperioritie and primacie in the Church, but onlie to ſeeke the glorie of thy name, and the ſaluation both of themſelues & vs. Giue them libertie of ſpeech, boldlie without feare, to blame and rebuke all falſe doctrine, blaſphemous ſuperſtition, and abuſes in the Church. Open vnto them the doore of vtterance, that they may ſpeake the myſteries of Chriſt, and manifeſt them as they ought to doo; ſo ſhall their dooings bee profitable vnto the godlie. Aſſiſt them alſo with thine

eſpeciall grace, that they diſgrace not their doctrine by impuritie of life, but let their conuerſation anſwer vnto the doctrine which they teach and preach: and eſpeciallie, for the paſtor of this pariſh, and ſhepheard of my ſoule heere preſent, from whoſe mouth I learne thy bleſſed will; I hartilie praie, that thou wilt keepe him in religion ſincere, and pure from enorme offences in outward conuerſation. Endue him with a long and healthfull life, if it be thy good pleaſure, that manie a good daie and yeare he may continue in preaching the gladſome voice of thy gratious Goſpell, among vs, without contention and ſtrife.
                        And, O ſonne of God, which art the Lord of all the flocke, worke thou effectuallie by thy preachers, ſpeake thou within vs to our harts, the bleſſed will of thine eternall father, and confirme thy doctrine in our minds by thine holie ſpirit. Grant that we may trulie knowe and diſcerne the ſame, from the howling of woolues, and from the inchanted ſongs of ſeducing hirelings. And grant that we may knowe thee, euen as thou knoweſt thine, heauenlie father; and to walke religiouſlie and righteouſlie in thy ſight, ſhewing our ſelues to be of that holie ſeede, which praiſeth thy name for euermore. Come holie ſpirit, open mine hart and eares, that I may conceiue the profit of thy whoaleſome doctrine, and the ſweet comforts reuealed in thy holie word, by the preaching of the Goſpell.
                        O Lord, I acknowledge with teares my ſluggiſhneſſe, and careleſnes in ſeeking thy truth; and bewaile the wretched coldneſſe and hardneſſe of my hart; beſeeching thee to endue me with an vnfeigned longing, and an ardent deſire of holie Sermons. Grant that in this life I may worſhip the feet of the preachers of peace, and reuerence the true diſpenſers of thy myſteries, thy faithfull miniſters, with double honor, and none otherwiſe to obeie their godlie ſermons, than I would,

if a voice ſhould ſound from the heauens. Let me not, for the blemiſhes and imperfections of ſome particular men, vnreuerentlie conceiue of thy whole miniſterie. Worke alſo within me, that deſpiſing thy word deliuered vnto vs, I neuer ſeeke after ſtrange reuelations, or violent rauiſhings, both beſides, and contrarie to thy word; but bearing alwaies in mind the order which thou haſt appointed, may conſtantlie embrace thy word manifeſted in thy Church. Finallie, impart ſuch grace vpon vs, that we may imitate and followe the good works of holie men, caſting off the old man, by putting on the new, which is created after God, in righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        A praier, that God would both feede and defend his Church; to be vſed before the Communion.
                        
                        
                           O Heauenlie heardman, and nurſſe of all things liuing, which of thy meere goodneſſe ſatiſfieſt all creatures that haue life; ſuffer not thy Church to pine awaie, and be famiſhed, for lacke of the food of thy bleſſed word, but feed vs continuallie with thy goodneſſe. Suffer not thou, O Lord, which giueſt ſuſtenance to all fleſh, thy faithfull ſeruants to be depriued of perfect doctrine, and moſt pure and ſound Sacraments, which are indeede the food of eternall life; but feed vs continuallie with Angels food, that is, with thy holie word, and with Chriſt Ieſus, whereby our harts may bee made righteous & ſtrong to him-ward. Let vs not like the children of Iſrael, loath this heauenlie manna, which thou ſo mercifullie and aboundantlie powreſt downe vpon vs; neither let vs luſt againe after the fleſh-pots of Aegypt, leaſt thy wrath being kindled againſt vs alſo, thou cauſe it not onelie to ceaſe, and to

fall no more from heauen vpon vs; but alſo thou ſmite vs with moſt greeuous plagues, as thou diddeſt the Iſraelites.
                        But rather, as new-borne babes, remembring how it is written, that man ſhall not liue by bread onlie, but by euerie word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God; let vs hartilie deſire the ſincere milke of thy word; let our ſoules delight in fatneſſe; let vs come earelie and late to the waters, to buie, and eate, to ſatiſfie our hunger and thirſt: let vs harken diligentlie vnto thee, and eate that which is good, and labour continuallie without wearineſſe, for the meate that periſheth not.
                        O Lord, let vs neuer ſee the daie, wherein thou ſhalt be prouoked to ſend a famine in our land againe; a famine, I ſaie, not of bread; nor a thirſt of water; but of the hearing of thy word, O God. Far bee that famine from vs, good Lord. Neither let vs anie more deſerue to be caſt out of our owne cities, townes, and houſes, and to wander in ſtrange lands, from Sea to Sea, from the North to the South, from Eaſt to Weſt, running to and fro, like hunger-ſtarued wretches, to ſeeke the food of thy word, as we ſometimes haue done, O Lord, and yet not find it; leaſt by that meanes we doo not onelie periſh in bodie, but alſo in ſoule, for lacke of thy word, which is the verie food thereof.
                        But let thy word, O God, be ſtill neere vs, euen in our mouthes, and in our harts; the word of truth, I ſaie, which now is preached, taught, and receiued; and feed thou vs, whenſoeuer the famine either of bodie or ſpirit vexeth vs. O our father, giue vs this daie our daily bread, that we may walke in the ſtrength thereof daie and night, vntill we come to the holie hill of Horeb. Behold, Lord, according to thy commandement, we doo open our mouths wide, fill thou it full of thy heauenlie dainties, as thou haſt promiſed. Lord, euermore giue

vs the bread of life, and of heauen, that we may ſtedfaſtlie beleeue in thee. For behold, O Lord, we come vnto thee, as though we were famiſhed; let vs not therfore go awaie vnfed. We are an hungred, let vs not be ſent awaie faſting. Our minds (alas) hunger and thirſt greatlie after toies, and gauds of this world; and we haue nothing to ſet afore it; becauſe wee are poore and beggerlie wretches. But thou, O Lord, art rich in all good things, and the moſt plentifull giuer of the dainties of heauenlie ſatietie. O therefore, we beſeech thee, giue vs ſomewhat to eate; giue meate, I ſaie, vnto the wearie wandering ſouls; yet not ſuch as they luſt after, but ſuch as is conuenient for them, that being refreſhed of thee, which art the liuing and heauenlie bread, wherewith when we are once well fed, and that our ſtrength is come to vs againe, we may aſcend vnto more high things, and neuer heereafter hunger or thirſt anie more after vanities,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another praier to be vſed at the Sermon, before a Communion.
                        
                        
                           THou vſeſt, O moſt mightie God, to preſerue thoſe thy children, whom thou haſt louinglie adopted, with no leſſe care and diligence, than if they were ſheepe: and the ſame alwaies fed & led of thee, being their moſt louing ſhepherd, toward their owne health, and perfect commoditie; who, ſo long as they haue thee for their Maiſter and Gouernour, they ſhall be deſtitute neither of the meate nor drinke of thy moſt wholeſome doctrine and Sacraments. Whereby it is manifeſt, that if we pine awaie, ſo long as we liue in this miſerable and wretched life, for the hunger and thirſt of true and perfect goodneſſe; it happeneth for this cauſe, in that wee

haue forſaken thee, and followed ſtrange guides; wherof, and of none other, come the great perils and miſerable troubles of mind, which fall vpon vs.
                        Wherefore, we humblie beſeech thee, O moſt faithfull and louing ſhepheard, to call vs backe from errours, into the right and perfect waie. Correct the vices of the wandering and ſtraieng flocke, with the rod and ſheephooke of thy righteouſneſſe; ſo that we may feed at length orderlie, purelie, and chaſtlie, of the moſt wholſome delicates of thy ſacred word, & bleſſed Sacraments; by which meanes the whole head, hart, and all the powers of our mind may be made fat, and well liking; and we alwaies ſo vnderpropped with thy louing mercies, as we may finallie enioie, in thy houſe, the ſouereigne delights and deinties of euerlaſting life, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another praier to be ſaid before the Sermons, at the Court.
                        
                        
                           ALmightie God, and moſt mercifull Father, who haſt in thine infinite wiſedome hidden honour in ſhame, and life in death; that thou mighteſt make fooliſh the wiſdome of this world; and that hee that glorieth, ſhould glorie in the Lord: giue vs grace, that we ſtumble not, as ſome did, at the baſe eſtate and ſmall ſhew that outwardlie appeared in thy ſonne: but that rather denieng our owne wiſedome, to ſeeke for our ſaluation, where thou haſt hidden & laid it vp for vs; that is, in the ſimple miniſterie of thy Goſpell; that it may haue ſuch place amongſt vs, as it may reforme both Kingdoms and Courts, and our priuate houſes and perſons: that we may ioie in the preſent light of that lampe to our feet,

and followe it whither it goeth; giuing no reſt to the dealers of it, till they haue ſatiſfied our hungrie ſoules withall, aſſuring our ſelues, that we ſhall not want things needfull for this life; but ſhall be nouriſhed by thee, haue thine aſſiſtance and helpe to deliuer vs from all trouble; and finallie, the enioieng of thy preſence, where anie trouble ſhall not come neere vs anie more: but we ſhall be ſatiſfied, and haue perfect ioie in the ſight of thee, our moſt louing God and Father, in Ieſus Chriſt; to whom with thee, and the holie Ghoſt, be praiſe and glorie for euermore,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another.
                        
                           ALmightie God, and moſt mercifull Father, who haſt annointed thy ſonne with thy holie ſpirit, and ſent him to preach the Goſpell; that we, who before were in priſon, and bondage to ſinne and to death, might by him be ſet at libertie, and haue our wounded harts healed by faith of his ſweete doctrine: grant vs, that we loue not bondage rather than libertie, nor death rather than life; but that we may ſo receiue his word, as we may attaine to euerlaſting freedome, and life by it. And for as much, O Lord, as thou declareſt, that for contempt of thy word thou dooeſt oftentimes withdrawe the preachers of it, euen from thoſe to whom they ſeemed eſpeciallie to haue beene ſent; grant vs ſo to receiue the teachers of thy truth, as they may be continued amongſt vs, to our euerlaſting comfort in thee; to whom with the ſonne, and the holie Ghoſt, be all honour and glorie for euer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        
                        Another praier againſt hardneſſe of hart, and contempt of the word of God.
                        
                        
                           FOr as much as thy ſacred doctrine, O moſt mightie God, is eſpeciallie taught in the ſacred Church, wherby both thou thy ſelfe art manifeſtlie knowne, ſingularlie preached, and highlie magnified; and we alſo thereby ſtill called to heauen and heauenlie things: it behooueth vs, as manie as profeſſe to be of thy ſchoole, greatlie to reioice to be there; and as thy faithfull Diſciples with all our harts to deſire for to giue diligent eare vnto thee alone, and thy moſt wholſome inſtructions. For thou haſt oftener than once, (as thou diddeſt vnto the Iſraelites) both by thy ſacred Scriptures, and alſo through the miniſters of thy bleſſed word proteſted vnto vs, on this wiſe: Giue eare vnto me, O my people, & acknowledge me trulie to be thy God; not in words, I ſaie, onelie; but in mind verelie, and with a perfect and moſt pure worſhipping.
                        But we (alas) haue turned our harts from thy holie words, and ſo wretchedlie deſpiſed the doctrine of thy ſacred lawe and Goſpell; that we haue alwaies hitherto beene a ſlander vnto the ſame. But now are we verie hartilie ſorie for it; who truſting in the death and bloudſhedding of thy ſonne Ieſus Chriſt our Sauiour, doo with great feruencie, and moſt earneſt praiers, lamentablie call vpō thee for pardon of all our ſinfull crimes. And ſeeing we acknowledge thee to be our onlie God, we earneſtlie deſire thy gratious goodneſſe, to grant vs this requeſt; that we may now, and from hence-foorth for euer, giue eare onelie vnto thy diuine Maieſtie, and honour thee alone; neither make anie thine equall, or prefer anie thing before thee.
                        
                           
Suffer not our ſinfull hart, which of nature is diſpoſed vnto euill, to be hardened at thy fatherlie and friendlie admonitions: make the ſame ſoft, we hartilie praie thee, with the inſpiration of thy good grace and holie ſpirit; neither ſuffer vs, whom thou, of thine infinite goodneſſe, and not for our merits ſake, haſt choſen to be thy bleſſed people, and ſheepe of thy paſture, to ſtriue & ſtruggle againſt thy bleſſed commandements; like vnto the ſtiffe-necked Iewes, who wouldeſt oftentimes put therto the traill of thy mightie power. But grant thou, O moſt deere and excellent Father, who ſpeakeſt alwaie peaceable matters, and thoſe things which are for our ſingular commoditie; that we, which haue heretofore beene maruellous rebellious, ſtubborne, burdenous, and troubleſome vnto thee; may now become thy tractable, conformed, and obedient children; and euer hereafter haue ſo great a regard to thy bleſſed words, that with verie attentiue minds we may giue good eare to thoſe things, which thou ſpeakeſt and willeſt vs to doo. So dooing, we ſhall not onlie be ſaued, & adorned with glorie; but alſo, euerie thing of ours ſhall be repleniſhed with goodneſſe, truth, righteouſneſſe, and peace. Faith ſhall abound, and through the ſame ſhall we be plentiouſlie iuſtified, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, Amen.
                        
                        From all ſedition and priuie conſpiracie, from all falſe doctrine and hereſie; from hardneſſe of hart, and contempt of thy word and commandement: good Lord deliuer vs.
                        That it may pleaſe thee to giue to all thy people increaſe of grace, to heare meekelie thy word, and to receiue it with pure affection, and to bring foorth the fruits of the ſpirit: we beſeech thee to heare vs, good Lord.
                        That it may pleaſe thee to bring into the waie of truth, all ſuch as haue erred, & are deceiued; to ſtrengthen

ſuch as doo ſtand, and to comfort and helpe the weake-harted, and to raiſe vp them that fall; and finallie to beate downe Satan vnder our feete: we beſeech thee to heare vs, good Lord,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        A verie neceſſarie praier againſt hypocrites, falſe teachers, and deriders of the Goſpell.
                        
                        
                           WHoſoeuer they be, O almighty God, that make a true account of ſincere goodlineſſe, and pure religion, are exceeding ſorowfull, if they ſee the ſacred Church ſcattered, wholeſome doctrine derided, the praiſes of thy diuine name had in contempt; and ſuch things as appertaine to a deuout woorſhipping of thee, turned vnto heatheniſh gewgawes, and voluptuous pleaſures. To the intent therfore theſe things may in no wiſe happen as now vnto vs, which we ſee not to be far off; we powre foorth dailie before thee, with great ſubmiſſion, theſe our dolfull complaints. That thou wouldeſt firſt, of thine exceeding great goodneſſe, and louing mercie, blot out all our heinous ſinnes and offences, being in a maner infinite and exceeding greeuous; committed, not onelie through weakeneſſe and ignorance; but alſo done oftentimes both maliciouſlie, and of ſet purpoſe. Be fauourable, I ſaie, O God, vnto our greeuous ſinnes, and turne awaie from vs, in ſuch ſort, the moſt fierce wiles, and ſubtil laiengs await of Antichriſt; as thy ſacred Church be not depriued of all bleſſed ioie, and ſpirituall gladneſſe. O Lord, I beſeech thee, ſhew ſome experiment and proofe of thy ſelfe; declare thy name and thy power amongſt thoſe thy ſpitefull enimies. Bring downe Antichriſts kingdome, with all his vngodlie ſects, and ſchiſmaticall factions. Certes, ouerlong it hath oppreſſed vs; yea, and at this verie daie it

ſtill letteth, hindereth, and holdeth vnder foote verie manie, which elſe ſpeedilie would haue run to the kingdome of libertie, and beleeued the Goſpell. Pull it therfore downe, O Lord, with all his ſtumbling blocks, euill examples, peruerſe doctrine; and neuer ſuffer it to recouer againe.
                        Lord, thou both ſeeſt, and right well perceiueſt, how the cruell, malicious, and vngodlie Antichriſtians would inuade the Church, being ſo puft vp with pride, & inflamed with furie, ſcorning as well diuine lawes, as humane with like ſtatelineſſe and equall contempt; dooing nothing with courteſie and faithfulneſſe; but practiſing miſchiefe and naughtineſſe, and endeuouring ſo much as in them lieth, that thy bleſſed word may no where flouriſh; that true religion might be vtterlie extinguiſhed; that the perfect inuocating and calling vpon thy glorious name might be quite rooted out; and to bring all things to naught by forged tales, mens traditions, politike deuiſes, diueliſh deceipts, and verie much outrage. But as for thy beloued Iſrael, ſith ſhe hath by thy great mercie enioied ſo long peace, and bleſſed tranquillitie, let hir be ioined more and more vnto thee hir welbeloued, ſo as ſhe may continuallie laie ſure hold vpon thy worthie praiſes. Suffer not the mouths of hir good and wholeſome inſtructors to be cloſed vp, and put to ſilence. Permit not thy due honour to be had in obliuion, nor yet let the hymnes and ſongs, wherwith thou art highlie praiſed and celebrated, be vſurped of ſuch as will haue the ſame in deriſion and ſcorne. Finallie, we humblie beſeech thee, O excellent father, that what wrath or indignation ſo euer is due vnto vs, by reaſon of the heinous ſinnes we haue wickedlie committed, thou wouldeſt yet, for the glorie of thy famous name, turne it frō thy ſanctified Church, thy deere ſpouſe; and powre out the ſame rather vpon them, who with an enimielike

rage, and moſt malicious affection, imagine nothing elſe, but quite to marre, and vtterlie laie waſte thy bleſſed heritage; and in deede be no leſſe aduerſaries to thy bleſſed name, than of our peace and quietneſſe, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        A praier for vnbeleeuers, that all men may embrace the Goſpell.
                        
                        
                           VNto thee doo we crie, O Lord, father and maker of all men, which art rich vnto all that call vpon thee, and which commandeſt the light to ſhine out of darkenes. For thou wilt that all men ſhould be ſaued, and come to the knowledge of the truth. And therfore, of thy great loue thou diddeſt call vs to the participation of the lot of the Saints in light, which are by nature the children of wrath and of death; aliens and ſtrangers from the teſtaments of promiſe, hauing none hope, and without God in the world, but now are fellowe Citizens with the Saints, and of the houſhold of God, built vpon the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Ieſus Chriſt beeing the head corner ſtone, which ſuſteineth the whole building by his word of power.
                        Heare vs thy ſeruants, making ſupplication for ſuch as yet haue not hard the ſound of thy Goſpell, neither knowe thy name; but ſitting in darkeneſſe, and in the ſhadowe of death, haue their minds darkened, and are alienated from the life of God, by the ignorance that is in them, and are caried awaie vnto dumbe idols, and fained gods, euen as they are led, and run to worſhip that which is no God. Giue grace, that thy word may be knowne among them, and preached in euerie land, and the ſound there of go out into the ends of the world, that thou alſo maiſt be found of them

which ſought thee not, and famous among ſuch as neuer aſked after thee. Send foorth thy word, that they may be healed, and walke no more in the vanities of their mind.
                        O God, father of our Lord Ieſu Chriſt, King of glorie, giue them the ſpirit of wiſedome and reuelation, through the confeſſing of thee: inlighten their minds, that they may knowe what the hope is, wherevnto thou haſt called vs, and how pretious the glorie is of thine inheritance in the Saints, and how excellent the greatneſſe of his power is toward vs, which beleeue, according to the working of his mightie power, which thou haſt wrought in him, when he was raiſed by thee from the dead, and placed at thy right hand in heauenlie places, aboue all principalities & powers.
                        Open the harts of vnbeleeuers, that hearing thy word, they may acknowledge thee the onlie true God; and Ieſus Chriſt, whome thou haſt ſent; and may worſhip thee the father in the ſonne, and the ſonne in thee the father, with the holie ghoſt, euen as thou haſt reuealed thy ſelfe. Take the vaile from the harts of the Iewes, leaſt being blinded in the reading of the old Teſtament, they ſtumble at the ſtone and rocke of offence by incredulitie, and hardneſſe of their harts; that thy Sonne Chriſt crucified and preached, be not vnto them a ſtumbling blocke, and thy Goſpell the ſauour of death vnto death; but that being conuerted by true faith, to the knowledge of thee the father in the ſonne, their face being vncouered, they may behold thy glorie, knowing by the writings of the Prophets, the Meſſias, which thou haſt appointed to be the Sauiour of the world. Likewiſe, gather thou the Gentiles, to whome the Goſpell, the word of the Croſſe, is meere fooliſhneſſe, into thy congregation, that they may embrace thy miniſterie, caſting off all fleſhlie wiſedome, and leade all their cogitations captiue to the obedience

of the Goſpell.
                        Moreouer, our praier and ſupplication is, not onlie for thoſe aboue mentioned, but alſo for ſuch as either, although they reſiſt not thy truth and pure religion openlie and obſtinatelie, profeſſe our religion, yet mingled with manie ſuperſtitions and abuſes, worſhipping and calling vpon Saints departed out of this life, or be addicted to outward ceremonies, and rudiments of this world, burdening their conſciences with mans obſeruations, and traditions of their fathers, or truſting to their owne righteouſneſſe, or rather to the works and deedes of the fleſh, refuſe and make little accompt of thy righteouſneſſe, which is the true iuſtification; and go about to eſtabliſh their owne righteouſneſſe. But Chriſt is the end of the lawe for righteouſneſſe, to as manie as beleeue: and another foundation can no man laie, than that is laid in thy ſonne the Meſſias, which is the waie, the truth, the life, and the end of the lawe. For by his perfect obedience, and fulfilling of the lawe, by his innocent and bitter death, hee hath reſtored vnto vs ſaluation, and perfect righteouſneſſe, that euerie one which beleeueth on him, might not periſh, but haue euerlaſting life.
                        O God, the ſight of the blind, bring them home againe, which through ignorance either are intangled in doubtfull labyrinths, and groſſe errours, or countenance polluted religion; that lightened by thy ſpirit, they may returne into the right waie. And ſuch as with impudent faces, and ſtiffe neckes, doo obſtinatelie with an affected ignorance withſtand thine holie ſpirit, whoſe ſenſes the god of this world hath blinded, that the light of thy glorious Goſpell ſhine not ouer them; repreſſe and bridle their malice, that by ſlaughter and perſecutions they neither trouble nor deſtroie thy Church,
                        Amen.

Bleſſed ſhalt thou be in the citie, and bleſſed in the field, &c. But and if thou wilt not obeie the voice of the Lord thy God, to keepe and doo all his commandements and his ordinances, which I command thee this daie, then all theſe curſes ſhall come vpon thee, and ouertake thee. Curſſed ſhalt thou be in the citie, and curſſed in the field, &c. as in the whole Chapter.

For when he hath conſidered himſelfe, he goeth awaie, and forgetteth immediatlie what manner of one he was. But who ſo looketh in the perfect lawe of libertie, and continueth therein, he not beeing a forgetfull hearer, but a dooer of the worke, ſhall bee bleſſed in his deed.

If yee abide in me, and my word abide in you, aske what yee will, and it ſhall be done vnto you.

                           IMmortall praiſe and thanks be giuen vnto thee, O almightie God, and moſt mercifull father, who haſt giuen vs ſo pretious a gift of thy holie word, and vouchſafed vs to heare ſo glad tidings of thy ſacred Goſpell,

by the hand of this thy miniſter, who preſentlie by thy mercy hath vttered it vnto vs. And ſeeing thou haſt delt ſo gratiouſlie with vs, in the free publiſhing of thy Goſpell, amongſt vs this foure and twentie yeeres; that it ſeemeth thou haſt euen lifted vs vp to heauen, with the cities, wherein our Sauiour taught moſt, in his being vpon the earth; and haſt now in a manner throwne them downe to hell; and left in them a terrible and a fearfull example of thy iudgements, againſt thoſe that walke not woorthie the graces offered vnto them. Grant vs ſo to profit by this their chaſtiſement and correction, that as of thy grace thou haſt reuealed thy will vnto vs, which otherwiſe we could neuer haue knowne: ſo now ſtrengthen vs, O Lord, that we neuer refuſe thy Goſpell in vnbeleefe, nor ſeeke in the perſons of the preachers of it, anie cauſes and pretences of our infidelitie; but hauing thy word alwaies in our harts, and thy praiſes in our tongues, we may walke woorthie thy ſo great graces beſtowed vpon vs, and haue our conuerſation in heauen, that after wee may be taken vp thither vnto thee, alwaies to glorifie thee, with thy Sonne, and the holie Ghoſt,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        A thankes-giuing for the knowledge of God in his word.
                        
                        
                           WE giue thee thankes, O Father, Lord of heauen and earth, becauſe thou haſt hid the myſterie of thy word, which is the Goſpell of our ſaluation by thy Sonne, from the wiſe, and men of vnderſtanding in this world; and haſt reuealed the ſame to babes of baſe degree; certeinlie ſuch was thy good pleaſure. Thou haſt giuen vs all things in thy Sonne, whom none knoweth but thou Father; neither dooth anie knowe thee, except

thy Sonne, and he to whom thy Sonne ſhall reueale thee. We worſhip thee, we praiſe thee, we glorifie thee, we giue thee thanks for the hid wiſedome, which thou didſt determine before the world for our glorie, which was neuer knowne to the princes of this world, nor at anie time to the ſonnes of men, as it is now reuealed by the ſpirit; to whom the communion of the myſterie, which was hid from all ages, but is now opened to thy Saints, to whom thou wouldſt haue made knowne, what be the riches of this glorious myſterie. It is thine owne working, and of thy free mercie, that we are made heires and partakers of thy promiſe in Chriſt Ieſu, through the Goſpell, which bringeth vs tidings, and full aſſurance of the euerlaſting riches of thine infinite goodneſſe and mercie.
                        Bleſſed be God, euen the Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, which hath bleſſed vs with all ſpirituall bleſſings in heauenlie things, by Chriſt; and hath choſen vs in him before the foundations of the world, that we ſhould be holie, and without blame before him, in loue; who hath predeſtinated vs, to be adopted through Ieſus Chriſt, vnto himſelfe; according to the good pleaſure of his will, whereby he loueth vs by his beloued, in whom we haue redemption in his bloud, euen the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, according to the riches of his grace, wherein he hath abounded towards vs, in all wiſdome and vnderſtanding; and hath opened vnto vs the myſterie of his will, according to his good pleaſure, which he hath purpoſed in himſelfe, euen vntill the diſpenſation of the fulneſſe of time; that he might gather in one all things, both which are in heauen, and which are in earth, euen in Chriſt; by whom alſo we are choſen, when wee were predeſtinated, according to the purpoſe of him which maketh althings after the counſell of his owne will: that we might be to the praiſe of his glorie, which hoping haue beleeued in Chriſt, when

we heard the word of truth, euen the Goſpell of ſaluation. And this grace thou didſt extend toward vs, not by the works of righteouſneſſe, which we had done; but according to thy mercie thou ſauedſt vs, and didſt call vs with an holie calling, not according to our works, but according to thine owne purpoſe & grace, which was giuen to vs through Chriſt, before all times; and is now made manifeſt, by the appearing of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, which hath aboliſhed death, and brought life and immortalitie vnto light, through the Goſpell. To thee therefore, which art of power to eſtabliſh our harts, according to the reuelation of the myſterie, which was kept ſecret ſince the world began; but now is opened, and publiſhed among all nations, by the Scriptures of the Prophets, at the commandement of the euerlaſting GOD, for the obedience of faith; to thee, we ſaie, God onelie wiſe, be praiſe; through Ieſus Chriſt for euer, Amen.
                        
                        We beſeech thee, that according to the operation and working of thy mightie power, we may continue conſtant in true faith, and wholeſome doctrine: and at no time forſaking the wiſedome opened in the Goſpell, may followe the iudgement of worldlie reaſon, and fleſhlie vnderſtanding, which thou haſt beeſotted, and altogither confounded, in ſearching thy hidden myſteries. For thy ſpirituall wiſedome dooth farre exceed all wiſedome and vnderſtanding of the creatures, wherevnto fleſh can not attaine: neither can our bloud reueale, nor yet the naturall man, although he be indued with great ſharpeneſſe of wit, and worldlie vnderſtanding, perceiue the ſame. Grant, we beſeech thee, that we may be thy ſimple ſheepe, and little-ones, receiuing from thee the word of truth, without contradiction and diſputation: and that in the articles of faith, we bring not fleſhly wiſedome, but being made void of our proper vnderſtanding, may bring our minds into a

godlie captiuitie. Let thy Sonne, which deſcending from aboue, brought with him the eternall wiſedome of the Goſpell, from thy boſome, and was made a ſacrifice on our behalfe; but now exalted to thy right hand, beſtoweth his gifts: let him, we beſeech thee, ſhine in our harts. Likewiſe, cauſe thine holie ſpirit to inſtill into vs his diuine light, and breath vpon vs the new flame of thine heauenlie knowledge; till departing into the eternall life, we may behold thee the onlie and true God face to face; which liueſt and reigneſt in perpetuall glorie,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another thankes-giuing after the Sermon.
                        
                        
                           WE render vnto thee, O heauenlie father, moſt hartie thanks, for this ſpirituall & heauenlie nouriſhment of thy bleſſed word; wherewith our ſoules are not onelie well refreſhed at this preſent, but alſo our faith is ſtrengthened, our loue kindled, and our conſcience quieted. Wee moſt humblie beſeech thee, to giue vs grace, not onelie to be hearers of thy word, but dooers alſo of the ſame; not onelie to loue, but alſo to liue thy Goſpell; not onlie to fauour, but alſo to followe thy godlie doctrine; not onelie to profeſſe, but alſo to practiſe thy bleſſed commandements; that whatſoeuer we outwardlie heare, and inwardlie beleeue, we may ſhew foorth the ſame in our conuerſation and liuing, vnto the honour of thy holie name, the comfort of our Chriſtian brethren, and the health of our ſoules,
                        Amen.

                           O GOD, wee haue heard with our eares, and our fathers and preachers haue declared vnto vs, the noble works that thou haſt done of old time for vs. Grant therefore, we beſeech thee, O thou heauenlie huſbandman, that this ſeed of thy word now ſowne amongſt vs, may take ſuch deepe root in our harts; that neither the burning heate of perſecution cauſe it to wither, neither the thornie cares of this life doo choke it: but that as ſeed ſowne in good ground it may bring foorth thirtie, ſixtie, and an hundred fold; as thy heauenlie wiſedome hath appointed, to the glorie of thy holie name,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another praier, or thankes-giuing after the Sermon.
                        
                        
                           I Giue thee moſt humble thankes, Lord Ieſu Chriſt, that thou haſt vouchſafed euen now, abundantlie to refreſh and feed vs with the food of thy word. And I beſeech thee, that the vnderſtanding and knowledge of this thy word, may be wholſome, comfortable, and effectuall in vs; that this heauenlie ſeed now ſowne, doo not die or periſh in vs without fruit. Keepe our harts, O Lord; inuiron and compaſſe them about with the incloſure or hedge of thy grace; and by thy holie Angels preſerue and watch ouer the ſame, that the infernall fowle bird Satan pull not out thy ſacred word out of our harts. But prepare our breaſt, and make apt our harts vnto thee, good Lord, that they may firmelie keepe thy word, and that they may alwaie ſticke, and be as new and

freſh in our memories. Giue vs alſo ſtrength, poſſibilitie, and power, that our life may anſwere to thy doctrine heard. Giue increaſe alſo to thy word, O heauenlie huſbandman, that in vs it may augment & growe; and that by thy holie ſpeech and heauenlie eloquence, it may not onlie bring vs to the knowledge of thy will: but alſo, that we may execute, accompliſh, and fullfill that thou commandeſt and willeſt; and ſo perſeuering to the end, may at the laſt aſpire to thy celeſtiall kingdome,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another.
                        
                           O Gratious God, and moſt mercifull Father, which haſt vouchſafed vs the rich and pretious iewell of thy holie word; aſſiſt vs with thy ſpirit, that it may be written in our harts, to our euerlaſting comfort; to reforme vs, to renew vs, according to thine owne image; to build vs vp, and edifie vs into the perfect building of thy Chriſt; ſanctifieng and increaſing in vs all heauenlie vertues. Grant this, O heauenlie Father, for Ieſus Chriſts ſake,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another praier, for the accompliſhing of Gods will reuealed in his lawe.
                        
                        
                           SUCH truelie are to be accounted right happie amongſt mortall men, O moſt good and mercifull God, as haue thy ſacred lawe alwaie ſet out before the eies of their mind, which they make as a patterne to begin their life by, and as a rule to proceed by, when they haue begun: ſo that if they ſhall happen to go aſtraie, their fault may both

be amended thereby, and they alſo leade a more vertuous life, according vnto iuſtice. Theſe ſhall liue blameleſſe, and when their dooings ſhall be examined by vpright iudgement, they ſhall not be aſhamed; which will greatlie auaile, if it be diligentlie practiſed from the tender age. But I hartilie acknowledge, and earneſtlie confeſſe, O moſt deere father, that all mans policie is altogether vnprofitable, and none accompt at all to be made thereof, vnleſſe thou be preſent with thy bleſſed ſpirit, and dooeſt direct our minds. For otherwiſe, what gaine may we haue, by hearing or meditating of thy holie lawe, than a cold and verie hurtfull knowledge? Wherefore, my earneſt requeſt is, that thou wouldeſt not onlie miniſter ſtrength vnto vs by thy grace, for the accompliſhing of theſe things, which thou commandeſt in thy diuine lawe; but alſo to bring this vnto good effect, ſo that we may haue more felicitie in them, than in all our owne deuiſes, and take a greater delight in the continuall practiſe, and due execution thereof, than in anie fleſhlie or worldlie pleaſures, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another praier for ſtrength ſpeedilie to accompliſh Gods diuine lawe.
                        
                        
                           WHen as we on the one ſide, doo conſider the weaknes of our ſtrength, O moſt mightie God, and contrariwiſe, the abſoluteneſſe and perfectneſſe of thy bleſſed lawe; we euidentlie perceiue, that for the obteining thereof, thy moſt puiſſant helpe will ſtand vs in verie great ſteed. Firſt therefore, teach vs the true waies of thy holie commandements; moreouer, illuminate in ſuch ſort our mind and vnderſtanding, as we may be able to incline, with great feruencie, vnto thoſe things, which

thou haſt both taught and commanded. Furthermore, it is needefull for thee, to graunt vs power and abilitie, to performe whatſoeuer we haue learned of thee; otherwiſe it ſhall profit vs little or nothing at all, to haue knowledge, vnleſſe ſome part of obedience be either performed, or at leaſt-wiſe begun in vs, which the lewd inclination of our ſinfull harts doth greatlie hinder; and finallie, our ſenſes and corrupt affections are woonderfull huge aduerſaries heerevnto.
                        Succour thou vs therfore, we humblie beſeech thee, with thy good grace, and aboundant fauour, forgiuing whatſoeuer we haue committed, and doo dailie, after a moſt ſinfull manner, againſt thy ſacred lawe; neither let it be imputed vnto vs for our eternall deſtruction. And in the meane ſeaſon, O good God, quicken and lift vs ſo vp with thy vnſpeakable louing mercie, which we ſee offred vnto vs in the benigne promiſes of thy holie ſcriptures, that thou wouldeſt not permit vs to ſwarue from thy ſacred lawe, which thou haſt vouchſafed to ſet before vs, who doo with much feruencie deſire to be vnſeparablie annexed vnto thee. But grant, that we may execute, with an exceeding feruent deſire, the charge which is left vnto vs, ſo that we may maruellous ſpeedilie beſtir our ſteps and feet towards the fulfilling of thy bleſſed lawe. Cauſe thou vs, O excellent father, we humblie beſeech thee, to cut off, and caſt aſide all delaies; and that contrarie to the expectation of the vngodlie, who alwaies caſt lets to entrap vs, we may be obedient to thy ſacred precepts, ſo that all thoſe, which honour and loue thee purelie, may accompanie vs, that like as the earth is euerie-where repleniſhed with thy ineſtimable goodnes, ſo the number of thy true and faithfull ſuppliants, may be dailie more and more greatlie augmented, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        
                        A praier to be vſed of anie excommunicate perſon, or notorious ſinner, before the dooing of open penance in the Church, for true conuerſion and repentance, &c.
                        
                        
                           ETernall and euerliuing God, Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, thou that by the mouth of thy holie Prophets and Apoſtles haſt plainelie pronounced, that thou deſireſt not the death of a ſinner, but rather that he may conuert and liue: who alſo haſt ſent thine onelie ſonne to ſuffer the cruell death of the croſſe, not for the iuſt, but for ſuch as find themſelues oppreſſed with the burthen of ſinne, that by him and his aduocation, they may haue acceſſe to the throne of thy grace, being aſſured, that before they crie, they ſhall find fauour and mercie. Unto thee, moſt mercifull God, doo I miſerable wretch crie, whome for my filthie life, lewd conuerſation, and proud contempt of thee, and thy holy lawe, thou to the griefe & dolour of manie good Chriſtian harts, dooeſt iuſtlie ſcourge and puniſh, by the cenſures of thy Church, and haſt woorthilie cut off, ſecluded, and reiected, by excommunication from thy myſticall body, making me now a ſpectacle to God, to angels, and to men.
                        Unto thee, I ſaie, O Lord, and maiſter of all power, which calleſt offenders vnto thee, by waie of iudgement and affliction, and knoweſt the hardneſſe of our harts, which haue no power of our ſelues to returne and riſe vp, doo I come, and that in the name of thy Sonne, my Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, to acknowledge before thee, and this congregation, my heinous ſinnes, wherewith I haue too ſhamefullie polluted my ſelfe, and offended thee and thy Church. And heere proſtrate at the feete of thy Maieſtie, I craue

mercie and pardon of thee, and aſke forgiueneſſe of all the world, eſpeciallie of this congregation, whome I confeſſe I haue offended. Moſt humblie beſeeching thee, O father of mercies, to looke vpon me with thine eies of pitie, euen as thou lookedſt ſometime vpon the ſinfull woman taken in adulterie, and vpon Marie Magdalen in the banket, which proſtrating hir ſelfe at thy feet, bitterlie did bewaile hir wickedneſſe. Likewiſe fauour me, as thou didſt the Publicane ſtanding a far off in the Temple, without lifting vp his eies vnto heauen for ſhame, but ſtriking his breſt onelie, ſaid, Lord be mercifull vnto me a ſinner.
                        And firſt, O God, that thou wilt pierce through my hardened hart, and moue it by the power of thy holie ſpirit, in ſuch ſort, that I may come to a true knowledge of my ſinnes, and feele in my ſoule and conſcience the terrour of thy iudgement vpon all offenders. Eſpeciallie, O Lord, that as I haue offended thy Maieſtie, and a great number of this thy Chriſtian congregation, by my deteſtable fact and greeuous ſinne, ſo (beeing armed by thy grace to endure this mortification of my fleſh, like as my Sauiour Ieſus ſuffered for me in his fleſh,) I may now ſubiect my ſelfe to the iuſt ordinance of thy Church, and not refuſe openlie heere to acknowledge and confeſſe my faults (and that with all Chriſtian patience, and true humiliation, giuing to thee the glorie of thy name) before the face of thee and this congregation preſent, who may be eie-witneſſes of the ſame.
                        But becauſe, O Lord, the externall confeſſion, and outward acknowledgement of my ſinnes, without the inward contrition & dolour of the hart and ſoule, auaileth nothing in thy preſence, which art the ſearcher of the hart, and ſifter of the reines; I moſt humblie beſeech thee, that thou wilt ſo touch my hart and conſcience, and effectuallie worke in me perfect remorſe,

and deteſtation of my former offences, that without anie hypocriſie, and with true compunction of ſoule, and ſincere confeſſion of the mouth, I vtterlie loathing and condemning mine owne impietie, and damning that which the lawe pronounceth vniuſt and damnable, may attaine to ſome ſenſe and feeling of thy mercie, which thou haſt aboundantlie ſhewed vnto all mankind in Chriſt Ieſu our Lord.
                        Conuert me, O Lord, and I ſhall be conuerted; becauſe thou art my God, and being conuerted, I will doo penance. Heale me, O Lord, and I ſhall be healed; ſaue thou me, and I ſhall be ſaued, for thou art my praiſe. To me, I confeſſe, ſhame and confuſion of face is due, as I iuſtlie ſuffer this daie, but to thee honor and glorie for my redemption, who by thus iudging and puniſhing me, dooeſt by little and little giue me place to amend, and ſpace to repent; and haſt not ſuddenlie, and at vnwares taken me awaie from the face of the earth, and ouerwhelmed me by and by through thy iuſtice in my wicked deedes dooing, as I deſerued, and thou iuſtlie mighteſt. For which thy lenitie, patience, long-ſuffering, and mercie, O thou louer of my ſoule, I moſt humblie thanke thee; beſeeching thee ſo to mollifie my hart, that I may repent, and eſteeme greatlie of ſo great riches, and ineſtimable treaſures of thy goodneſſe.
                        Moreouer, O good Lord Ieſus Chriſt, grant (I beſeech thee) that among all the feares and terrours of my conſcience, I may take hold of thee by a liuelie faith, which haſt redeemed me from the curſſe of the lawe, and art made for me, wiſedome and righteouſneſſe, ſanctification and redemption; and may not, in the fight of conſcience, yeeld my ſelfe a ſlaue ſtill to Sathan, and deſpaire of thy mercie; but vpholden by the voice of thy Goſpell, may flee vnto thee my mediator, and iuſtified by faith, may haue peace with God, that ſo

comming vnto thee by hearing thy word to repentance, the Angels in heauen may continuallie haue occaſion to reioice; and I auoiding the fearefull vengeance, which moſt aſſuredlie ſhall fall vpon the inobedient, may be reſtored into the right of thy lawe, and receiued againe into the boſome of thy Church, as a member of thy myſticall body, and from my hart walke in all holie obedience to thee and thy holie word, to the praiſe of thy name, the comfort of thy Church, and the confuſion of Sathan,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        A thankes-giuing and praier vnto God, of a reconciled offender, or excommunicate perſon restored into the Church, to be vſed after open penance done at a Sermon, or otherwiſe.
                        
                        
                           HEauenlie father, fountaine of all mercie and conſolation, I confeſſe my ſelfe the chiefeſt of all ſinners, and a wretch moſt vnworthie to bee counted amongſt thy children, or to be a member of thy Church, if thou haue reſpect to the corruption of my nature, and horror of my manifold miſdeeds. But ſeeing it hath pleaſed thy fatherlie goodneſſe, not onlie freelie to elect and chooſe me in thy deere ſonne our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, by his death to redeeme me, by his Goſpell to call me, and by his holie ſpirit (which both are thine) to illuminate me: but alſo that thou haſt commanded thy holie word and ſacred Goſpell to be preached, not onlie to me, but to all the world, to the end that the penitent may haue an aſſurance of the remiſſion of all their ſinnes, great and ſmall, old and new, not onlie for a time, but euen as oft as they, from ſorowfull harts, and broken ſpirits, in bitter teares, ſhall bewaile the ſame, and call for thy grace and mercie.
                        
                           
In conſideration of this thy fatherlie adoption, and ineffable clemencie ſhewed vpon mee an vnwoorthie wretch, I can not but highlie praiſe and magnifie thy fatherlie mercie. A teſtimonie whereof I not onelie feele now in my ſelfe; but others alſo ſee the ſame euidentlie in this my conuerſion, and confeſſion of my fore-paſſed faults; in the which my penance dooing, I am aſſured that I haue not ſo much ſhamed my ſelfe before this godlie congregation, as I haue thereby confounded and ouercome mine enimie Satan, who for a time had me in bondage, and by whoſe venem and deceiuable entiſements, I heretofore haue beene verie rebellious to the wholeſome admonitions of the Church: for the which vile ſinnes, rebellion, and contempt, I confeſſe I haue beene woorthilie excommunicate, and puniſhed by the cenſures of the ſame.
                        But now, O Lord, ſeeing that the ſpirit of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath ſo farre preuailed in me, that by the power therof I am now ſet at freedome; & by thy mercie am returned againe to the ſocietie of thy Saints, and myſticall bodie of thy Church; I beſeech thee, for the obedience of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, ſo to accept me ſorowfull conuert, and to allow of this mine vnfeined repentance and confeſſion, that my former inobedience and faults be neuer laid to my charge. Haue mercie vpon me, O God, haue mercie vpon me, and abſolue me thy poore creature, not onelie from the ſentence of excommunication, but alſo from the ſinnes by me committed, and from all cenſures of the Church laid againſt me for the ſame, or before: and that Lord, giuen according to this my hartie and vnfeined repentance before thee, and all this congregation; and as I hartilie forgiue all the world, that in anie thing hath offended againſt me.
                        O Lord, pronounce thou my ſinnes to be cleanſed, and they ſhall be cleanſed; abſolue thou me from the

chaine of mine iniquities, wherewith I am faſt tied and bound, and I ſhall be abſolued; looſe thou my ſins in earth, and they ſhall be looſed in heauen: that being now by thy great goodneſſe and mercie acquited, and ſent awaie vncondemned of thee, as that ſinfull woman taken in adulterie was from hir accuſers; and receiued againe to the ſocietie of Ieſus Chriſt, into the boſome of his Church; to the participation of his bleſſed Sacraments; and finallie to the fruition of all thy benefits; I may, by the perpetuall aſſiſtance of thy holie ſpirit, not onelie more and more be diſpleaſed with my ſinnes, and bridle hencefoorth my corrupt affections, till Satan be cleane troden vnder my feet, by the power of my redeemer Chriſt: but alſo be ſo conducted in all the courſe of my life hereafter, that I neuer fall into the like ſinnes, impietie, and contempt of God and godlineſſe anie more, but that continuallie I may be ſubiect to the voice of the Church, and to the miniſters of the ſame, and proceed dailie in all maner of good works, and Chriſtian obedience, to the praiſe of thy holie name, and edifieng of thy Church; by Ieſus Chriſt our Lord and onelie Sauiour, to whom with thee and the holie Ghoſt be giuen all honour, glorie, praiſe and thankes-giuing, not onelie of me miſerable ſinner and vnwoorthie wretch, but alſo of all men, Angels and creatures, both in heauen and in earth, from this time foorth for euermore,
                        Amen.
                        
                           
                              Luke 15, verſes 6, 7.
                           Reioice with me, ſaith Chriſt. For I haue found my ſheepe which was loſt; yea I ſaie vnto you, there is ioie in heauen in the preſence of the Angels of God, ouer one ſinner that repenteth, more than ouer ninetie and nine iuſt perſons, which neede no repentance.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                        A praier to be vſed for the conuerſion of anie notorious ſinner, that doth open penance in the Church.
                        
                           PItifull God, omnipotent Lord, and mercifull Father; who for that good will thou beareſt vnto vs in Ieſus Chriſt thy deere ſonne, wilt not the death and deſtruction of a ſinner; but rather that he by the inſpiration and moouing of thy holie ſpirit conuert and liue, who alſo dooſt witneſſe, the vertue and ſtrength of thy word to be ſuch, that it cauſeth the mountaines to ſhake, the rocks tremble, and the flouds to drie vp: behold we thy children and people here proſtrate before thee, moſt humblie beſeech thee for Ieſus Chriſts ſake, pitifullie to looke vpon all ſinners, and eſpeciallie vpon this our ſiſter here preſent, who once was baptiſed in thy name, and hath profeſſed hir ſelfe ſubiect to this religion, and vnto the diſcipline of thy Church; though Satan alas now for a while hath ſo blinded hir, that wilfullie ſhee hath contemned both the one and the other.
                        But, O Lord, as thou alone knoweſt; ſo maiſt thou alone change and mollifie the harts of the impenitent ſinners: thou, I ſaie, which by the voice of the prophet Nathan awakedſt Dauid from his deadlie ſecuritie; and who without anie prophet didſt beate downe the pride of Manaſſes in the priſon, after that he had filled Ieruſalem with all kind of impietie: thou which turnedſt the hart of Peter at the onelie looke of thy deere ſonne our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, after that fearfullie with horrible imprecations hee had thriſe denied, and openlie forſworne thee: thou which openedſt the eies of the blind excommunicate man, and cauſedſt him to beleeue thy ſaiengs; & which forgaueſt the woman

taken in adulterie, & ſentſt hir awaie vncondemned of thee & hir accuſers; thou I ſaie, O Lord, whoſe mercies without meaſure endure for euer. To thee doo we praie for this our ſiſter, heere preſentlie puniſhed, and dooing open penance for hir offences, earneſtlie deſiring thee, O father of mercies, firſt ſo to pierce and moue hir heart with the feare of thy ſeuere iudgements, which ſuffereſt no child of thine to go vncorrected in this world, to the end they may eſcape vnpuniſhed in the world to come: and ſo to open hir eies, that ſhe may begin to ſee and vnderſtand, how fearefull and terrible a thing it is to fall into thy hands, and to prouoke thy wrath and indignation againſt hir.
                        Let it pleaſe thy Maieſtie, by the vertue of thy holie ſpirit, ſo to mollifie hir hard hart, I ſaie, that ſhe may now at length feele how greeuouſlie ſhe hath offended, both againſt thee and the Church; and giue hir thy grace to acknowledge, accuſe, and damne as well before vs, whome ſhe hath offended, as before thy preſence, this hir contempt and ſinne ſo notorious and damnable, leaſt that by hir obſtinacie and wilfull rebellion, thy Church and congregation being further prouoked, be compelled with greefe of harts to cut hir quite off from thy myſticall bodie; whome we, O Lord, vnfeinedlie deſire to receiue within the Church, as a liuelie member of thy deere ſonne our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Heare vs, mercifull father; call backe againe this our deere ſiſter from eternall deſtruction, where-into Sathan would leade hir; that we all, who before thy preſence, euen for hir rebellion and tranſgreſſions doo mourne, may receiue hir againe with gladnes and ioie, and ſo render praiſe and honour vnto thee before this thy holie congregation.
                        We grant our ſelues, O Lord, vnworthie, whome thou ſhouldeſt heare; becauſe we ceaſe not to offend thee by our continuall tranſgreſſing of thy holie precepts.

Looke not vpon vs, mercifull father, in this our corrupt nature, but looke downe to thy deere ſonne, whome thou of thy meere mercie haſt appointed our head, high Biſhop, aduocate, mediator, and onlie propitiator. In him, and in the merits of his death, we humblie beſeech thee, mercifullie to behold vs; and ſuffer not the moſt innocent bloud of thy deere ſonne ſhead for vs, and this our penitent ſiſter, to be prophaned by the tyrannie and ſleight of Sathan: but by the vertue of the ſame, let our ſiſter be brought to vnfeined repentance, and conuerſion, that ſo ſhe may eſcape that fearfull indignation, into the which ſhe appeareth to haue fallen.
                        Grant I ſaie, O Lord, vnto this our ſiſter, the repentance of the hart, and ſincere confeſſion of the mouth, to the praiſe of thy name, to the comfort of thy Church, and to the confuſion of Sathan. And vnto vs grant, O Lord, that albeit we cannot liue altogether cleane from ſinne, and void of offences; yet that we fall not into the like horrible crimes of impietie and contempt, to the diſhonour of thy holie name, to the ſlander and offence of our brethren and ſiſters, and infamie of thy holie Religion and Goſpell, which we profeſſe. Let thy godlie power, O Lord, ſo perpetuallie aſſiſt and ſtrengthen our weakeneſſe, and conduct vs in all the courſe of our whole life; that neither the craft of Sathan, nor the tyrannie of ſinne drawe vs vtterlie from the obedience required in true Chriſtians: but that contrarilie beeing ſubiect to the voice of thy Church, and to the miniſters of the ſame vnder thee, by holineſſe and innocencie of life we may declare to the wicked generation, what difference there is betweene the children of light, and the children of darkeneſſe; that all men ſeeing our good works, may praiſe thee in the daie of viſitation. This we aſke of thee, O heauenlie Father, in the boldneſſe of our head and mediator

Ieſus Chriſt, praieng furthermore as he hath taught vs: Our Father, &c.
                        
                     
                     
                        Another praier to be ſaid of the beholders of anie offender in the Church, or elſe-where.
                        
                        
                           ALmightie God, and moſt mercifull father, whoſe iudgements are vnſearchable, and whoſe waies are paſt finding out; teach vs to iudge wiſelie of this our ſiſter, and all other afflicted with thy hand; not condemning them, but rather profiting by them, that their example may leade vs to repentance, and bringing foorth ſuch fruits, as thou requireſt of all thoſe that are planted in thy Church; leaſt by continuing fruitleſſe, we prouoke thee at the laſt to the cutting of vs downe. And becauſe thou haſt giuen vs a ſauiour able to heale all our infirmities, deliuer vs by him, O Lord, from all the bonds of Sathan; that being ſet at libertie by him, we may fore-ſee the ſtraight doore, and enter into it, leauing the wide gate that leadeth to deſtruction, that we may be ſaued with thoſe few that are appointed therevnto in Ieſus Chriſt, to whome with thee, and the holie Ghoſt, be all honor, praiſe and glorie, for euermore,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        A thanks-giuing for the conuerſion of an excommunicate perſon, or other publike offender after penance.
                        
                           WE thanke the mercie and goodneſſe of our God, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, for the conuerſion & patient penance doing of this our ſiſter, whereby ſhe hath not ſo much endured the reproch and infamie of hir owne ſinnes, as in deede ſhe hath

confounded and ouercome Satan hir deadlie foe, who went about to make hir his continuall ſlaue: and by whoſe ſubtile ſleights and euill ſuggeſtions, ſhe hath heretofore beene diſobedient to thy holie lawes, and wholſome admonitions of thy Church. And now, O Lord, ſeeing that the ſpirit of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath ſo farre preuailed in hir, that ſhe is returned to our ſocietie; let it pleaſe thee for the obedience of the ſame our Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſo to accept hir, that hir former diſobedience and ſinnes be neuer laid to hir charge, but that ſhe may increaſe in all goodneſſe, till Satan finallie be troden vnder hir feete and ours, by the power of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, to whom with thee and the holie Spirit, be all honor and glorie now and euer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Before the publike adminiſtration of the holie ſacrament of Baptiſme, the better to call to mind our owne vow and promiſe made long ſince vnto God, praie priuatelie to your ſelfe, and ſaie:
                        
                        
                           O Moſt bleſſed fore-goer and guide of Chriſtian people, Ieſu Chriſt, who ſubmitting and humbling thy ſelfe, vouchſafedſt to be baptiſed of Iohn in the riuer Iordan, and waſt not onlie baptiſed in water, but alſo in blood, and in the holie Ghoſt: vouchſafe euen ſo to incline, bow and diſpoſe our outwarde life, with our inward mind, affects, and deſires, in the fulfilling of all righteouſneſſe: ſo that we being now mortified & dead to the old Adam, through thy holie witneſſe of baptiſme, by the working and operation of the holie Ghoſt, may alwaie haue our holy couenant in remembrance, & before our eies, that couenaunt, vow, and promiſe (I ſaie,) which we haue taken vpon vs in our baptiſme; to the intent that we,

as faithfull champions, ſtriuing againſt the world, the fleſh, and the diuell, may vanquiſh and ouercome them with all other, which might be noifull and hurtfull vnto vs,
                        Amen.
                        Or giue thanks for our regeneration and ſanctification, as afterward in the praier vpon Whitſundaie.
                     
                     
                        Or praie thus for the ſpirituall waſhing awaie of thy ſinnes.
                        
                        
                           HAue mercie on me, O GOD, according to thy great tenderneſſe of hart. For in wickedneſſe borne I was, and in ſinnes my mother conceiued me: ſo that of nature all that I am, I am but ſin. This my confeſſion of the truth, I knowe well, is right acceptable vnto thee, wheras in the moſt part of others thou haſt either hid the ſame, or made it vnknowne. Purge and ſprinkle mee with the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt thine vnſpotted lambe. If thou waſh me, I ſhall be as white as ſnowe: waſh me thoroughlie therfore from mine errours, clenſe me not onlie of my ſinnes paſſed; but alſo of my whole life to come; ſo ſhall I receiue theſe glad tidings into my hart, that my ſins be forgiuen me. With the baptiſme of ſpirit in the fire of thine illumination baptiſe me, which is the might & efficacie of baptiſme, which we receiued in our childhood. Grant that the ſame ſpirit might alwaie conduct vs, & let this ſpirituall waſhing of baptiſme continue with vs, vntill the infection and vice, which we haue by nature of old Adam, be perfectlie taken awaie by the death of the fleſh, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        
                        Or praie that the benefits of both the holie Sacraments may be applied vnto our ſoules health.
                        
                           
                              O
                            Bleſſed Trinitie, and eternall God of one eſſence; giue grace, that in euerie combate, and eſpeciallie at the point of death, being mindfull of thy couenant made with vs at our Chriſtening, & of thy moſt comfortable promiſe anexed, He which beleeueth, and is baptiſed, ſhall bee ſaued: we may neuer doubt, either of thy mercifull good-will towards vs, or of the free remiſſion of our ſinnes: but by often remembring this ſigne and couenant, may dailie more and more be confirmed in faith, and hope of perpetuall happineſſe: and applie thy benefits, which certainlie thou haſt promiſed, and faithfullie wilt performe vnto our ſelues. For thy promiſes made to ſuch as beleeue and truſt in thee, be not vaine, and to no purpoſe.
                        Likewiſe vphold our ſoules by the Sacrament of thy Supper, that ſtrengthened with the ſeale of this new teſtament, we may be the more certaine; and confirmed touching our reconciliation, and euerlaſting righteouſneſſe; & alwaies beare it fixed in our minds. For if the teſtament of a man, which is prooued after the death of the Teſtator, be not ſmall accounted of; much more ſhould the laſt teſtament and holie Sacrament of our Sauiour Chriſt remaine pure, and in continuall force and remembrance.
                     
                     
                        
                        Or praie, that we may rightlie and trulie receiue the bleſſed Sacraments.
                        
                        
                           
                              O
                            Moſt mercifull God, and louing father, who by thy ſon Ieſus Chriſt haſt abrogated the ſuperfluous ceremonies of the Lawe, and haſt deliuered vs from the bondage thereof, giuing vnto vs ſure & certaine ſeals and ſacraments of thy grace; and our free redemption through the moſt pretious bloud of thy deere Sonne Ieſus Chriſt. Grant, O Lord, we beſeech thee, that we may euermore vſe them according to thy ſonne our Sauiours inſtitution, who hath left them as pledges of his great loue towards mankind, & as continuall remembrances of his moſt pretious death, which he ſuffered vpon the wood of the croſſe for our redemption: who by the fountaine of water hath regenerated vs, and by his moſt pretious bloud hath purged vs. Make vs therefore to receiue theſe holie myſteries without corruption, to vſe them without alteration, to continue them without ſuperſtition, to the honour and glorie of thy moſt holie name, through Ieſu Chriſt our Lord, to whom with thee and the holie Ghoſt, be all honour and glorie now and for euer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        After publike baptiſme praie, and giue thanks ſecretlie to yourſelfe, as time will ſerue, ſaieng:
                        
                        
                           WE yeeld thee moſt hartie thanks, O heauenlie Father; for that it hath pleaſed thee to regenerate vs with the fountaine of water, by faith in the bloud of thy ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, and to purge vs from that originall ſinne, which we receiued of the old Eue. But who is able, oh Lord, to

to giue thee ſufficient praiſes? Or who can expreſſe thy louing kindneſſe and great mercies towards mankinde, who haſt not onlie redeemed him from the yoke of the lawe, the bondage of hell, and deſtruction of the diuell: but alſo like a mercifull and louing father, euen in our firſt entrance into this world, waſhedſt vs from iniquitie, and haſt giuen vs the Sacrament of Baptiſme, euen as a memoriall of our election, in thy Sonne Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, whereby beeing made thine adopted children, we may by the ſanctification of thy ſpirit, inherit the euerlaſting kingdome, through the ſame Ieſus Chriſt our Lord,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Or praie for the fruits of Baptiſme thus.
                        
                           MOſt heauenlie and eternall father, we thy humble ſeruants entirelie deſire thy fatherlie goodneſſe, that as thou haſt begun in vs a newe birth, & waſhed vs with the fountaine of regeneration, whereby we are made members of thy bodie, and elected into the number and felowſhip of thy Church and congregation: ſo thou wouldeſt powre vpon vs the grace of thy ſpirit, to direct our liues according to this beginning, in holineſſe and pureneſſe, that we may mortifie the luſts of the fleſh, reſiſt the aſſaults of Sathan, and auoide the alurements of the wicked world, remembring alwaies that Baptiſme doth repreſent vnto vs our vocation, quenching thoſe ſparks of concupiſcence that we all drawe from the old Adam, and quickning vs in thoſe good fruits of Chriſt our Sauiour, who continuallie preſerue vs with his holie ſpirit for euer and euer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        
                        Or praie for the continuance of the true inſtitution of the Sacraments thus:
                        
                        
                           
                              O
                            Moſt mightie and moſt mercifull God, by whoſe power the heauens and earth, and all things therein, are created; who haſt placed euerie thing in a moſt excellent order, and haſt framed man after thine owne ſimilitude and image, raiſing him from hell to heauen, from wo to ioie, from damnation to ſaluation; and haſt giuen him through thy ſonne Ieſu Chriſt, a moſt ſure bond of thy promiſe made in the beginning to mankind for the redemption of the world, ſending thine onlie begotten Sonne Ieſu Chriſt to performe the ſame, who made one onelie oblation and ſacrifice for the ſinnes of the whole world, and did ordaine and inſtitute two moſt holie Sacraments to continue the remembrance of the ſame; make vs euer mindfull (we beſeech thee) of theſe thine ineſtimable treaſures. Continue, oh Lord, this thy fauour towards vs. Let not tyrants preuaile againſt thy Church, but let thy mightie power be ſhewed, that the ſacred rites may cōtinue in thy Church, that the enimies may be ouerthrowne; as the Turke, who would vtterlie deſtroie thoſe moſt holie Sacraments, which thou haſt ordeined for our ſaluation; as the Anabaptiſts, which like heretikes, alter thy moſt holie inſtitution; as the Atheiſts, who bred in them great corruption. Conuert them, we beſeech thee, O Lord, and eſtabliſh vs in the truth of thy holie ſpirit, by thy mightie power, that both now and euer wee may continue in the right inſtitution of thy Sacraments, which thy Sonne our Sauiour Chriſt hath left moſt perfect vnto vs, to the endleſſe ioie and conſolation of our ſoules. To whome therefore, with thee,

and the holie Ghoſt, be all honour, glorie, and praiſe, world without end,
                        Amen.

                        Christian praiers to be ſaid before, at, and after ye receiue the holie Communion, and first: An effectuall meditation of the right Chriſtian beleefe in the holie Sacrament of the Lords ſupper, and of the woorthie and fruitefull receiuing the ſame, to our comfort and ſaluation; to be diligentlie read before you receiue.
                        
                        
                           O My ſoule, let vs now carefullie conſider firſt, whether we bee come; namelie, to the celeſtiall table, heauenlie banket, greate feaſt, coſtlie repaſt, and ſumptuous ſupper of the moſt puiſſant, glorious, mightie, and magnificent King of kinges, and Lord of lordes, Ieſus Chriſt thy

moſt mercifull maker, righteous redeemer, ſouereigne ſauiour, and deere ſpouſe; and that of neceſſitie, as both forced therevnto by his iuſt commandement, and alſo allured and inuited by his mercifull promiſes.
                        Secondlie, O my ſoule, let vs rightlie knowe, and diligentlie marke, what things are heere preſentlie ſet before vs on this holie Table, and prouided for vs in this bleſſed banket to taſte of; namelie, that the deintie diſhes, and the refection and meate which we muſt in verie deede ſeeke for onelie in this ſacred ſupper, are no vaine ceremonies, no bare ſigne, no vntrue figure of a thing abſent, no earthlie bodie, no carnall meate, nor anie fleſhlie ſubſtance; but as the ſacred Scripture ſaith, and other holie men doo rightlie tearme and call them, The Bread and Cup of the Lord; a heauenlie refection; the ſweet deinties of our ſauiour; the nouriſhment of our ſoules; an inuiſible meate; a ſpirituall foode; a ghoſtlie ſubſtance: which all are heere now moſt mercifullie offered, and exhibited vnto vs, and all other faithfull ſoules, as the ſoueraigne preſeruatiue againſt death; the conſeruatorie to euerlaſting life; the comfortable medicine of the ſoule; the ſalue of immortalitie; the pledge of eternall health; the defence of faith; the hope of the reſurrection; the memorie of Chriſt; the annuntiation of his death: finallie, the communion of the bodie and bloud of the Lord Ieſus, in a maruellous incorporation, which by the holie Ghoſt (the verie bond of our perfection with Chriſt) is through faith wrought in the ſoules of the faithfull, whereby not onlie their ſoules doo liue to eternall life; but alſo they ſurelie truſt to win to their bodies a reſurrection to immortalitie. In the which alſo, we may not onlie heare, ſee, taſte, and knowe the mercie of God our Creator ſealed; the ſanctification by Chriſt our redeemer towards vs confirmed; the remiſſion of our ſinnes through the holie Ghoſt our comforter and regenerator

fullie ſatiſfied and eſtabliſhed: but alſo moſt ſenſiblie and effectuallie to our further comfort, in deed feele wrought in vs; the tranquillitie of conſcience; the increaſe of faith; the ſtrengthening of hope; and the long ſpreading abroad of brotherlie loue and kindneſſe, with manie other ſundrie maruellous graces and benefits of God, moſt profitable vnto vs. Which things well conſidered and weighed, my ſoule, O with what feruent affection and earneſt zeale ought they now to inflame our hart, and kindle our mind, greedilie to couet and deſire the participation of theſe moſt holie myſteries; yea, often to long and hunger after this healthſome bread, and continuallie thirſt for this diuine, heauenlie, and bleſſed food!
                        Thirdlie and laſtlie, O my ſoule, let vs aduiſedlie call to mind, and well vnderſtand the cauſe, wherefore wee are now come vnto this holie table of the Lord: which indeed is onlie to this end; that we ſhould now be godlie gheſts, not idle gazers; hungrie eaters; not ſteruing lookers on; to feede our ſelues, and not to hire others to feed for vs: that ſo we may liue by our owne meate, and not periſh for hunger, while other deuoure all. We are come togither, I ſaie, O my ſoule, with this congregation aſſembled, preſentlie to celebrate a ſacrifice, not priuatelie in one kind for the dead, nor to make a myſterie a ſacrifice, nor of a communion to make a priuate eating, nor of two parts to haue but one, nor yet to applie it for the dead, and ſo we to looſe the fruit that are aliue. No no, my ſoule; God forbid that we ſhould come to celebrate this holie myſterie after anie ſuch ſort, or to anie ſuch vſe or purpoſe. For that were to declare our ſelues vnwoorthie of the Lord, yea to be accurſed of him, for committing ſuch ſpirituall blaſphemie and robberie. But knowe, that we are come hither now publikely and openly at this the Lords boord, to miniſter & doo that, which he himſelfe,

a little before his death, vouchſafed in his owne perſon moſt wiſelie, kindlie, and louinglie to inuent, prouide, inſtitute, ordeine, doo, eſtabliſh, and command; as a moſt neceſſarie waie and meane for it, the better to take ſome place in vs; and not to be fruſtrate of it end and purpoſe. Yea, to doo that which his holie Apoſtles alſo afterward, togither with the godlie fathers in the primitiue Church both vſed, practiſed, authoriſed, and confirmed; according as it was deliuered and giuen by the firſt author thereof onelie: that is to ſaie, euen openlie and publikelie to celebrate, in the Lords moſt happie commemoration and remembrance, at this his holie table, the heauenlie memorie of that moſt maruellous worke, and deere bought benefit of our redemption and ſaluation, wrought by Chriſt Ieſus, to our endleſſe conſolation, profit, commoditie and eternall ſaluation, in his (with all reuerence named) moſt pretious death, painfull croſſe, & bloudie paſſion.
                        And wite thou well, O my ſoule; that like as Moſes, Aaron, and Phinees long ſince did ſomtimes eate Manna in the wilderneſſe, then ſpirituallie vnderſtanding thoſe viſible things: euen ſo now, we in like maner ſpirituallie vnderſtanding theſe holie myſteries, (for it is the ſpirit that quickeneth and giueth life, the fleſh profiteth vs nothing, as ſaith our Sauiour) muſt here alſo ſpirituallie hunger, ſpirituallie taſte, ſpirituallie eate the fleſh of Chriſt, and ſpirituallie drinke his bloud indeed, in theſe holie myſteries, by faith onlie, and aſſured conſtant beleefe; that the bleſſed bodie of Chriſt was crucified, and his pretious bloud ſhed vpon the Croſſe for our ſaluation. And ſo receiue this the Lords ſupper, euen for a token, badge, or cognizance of this faith and ſaluation in Chriſts merits; declaring therby euermore his death and paſſion, with thanks-giuing, vntill he come.
                        Neither muſt we now ſo much as once dreame of

anie groſſe or carnall eating, or fleſhlie feeding; or thinke that we are come at this preſent to feed our ſenſes and bellie to corruption, (for that were baſelie to abiect and bind our ſelues to the elements and creatures, and ſo to declare our ſelues drowned in deed in the dirtie lake of blindneſſe and ignorance:) but onlie and in truth to nouriſh and feed our inward man to immortalitie, and life euerlaſting: namelie, that as our outward man is nouriſhed by letting in this bodilie meat into the ſtomach, that is helthſome and ſound to be digeſted; ſo our inward man may be ſpirituallie fed and ſatiſfied, by receiuing the meate thereof into our ſoule and hart, ſound and whole in faith. And therfore we ſhall not need now at this preſent time, in dooing theſe things, to whet our teeth, O my ſoule; but (as S. Cyprian ſaith) with ſincere faith to breake and diuide this holie bread. For ſurelie, without faith, (which indeed is the onelie inſtrument moſt neceſſarie, in the right vſe of all theſe holie myſteries) it is impoſſible to pleaſe God heerein; neither can the vnbeleeuers and faithleſſe folke feed vpon the Lords pretious bodie, nor enioie the eating and drinking of this ſo high and diuine nouriſhment of ſpirituall food. Yea, to haue anie other eating, than ſpirituallie by faith onelie, is plaine idolatrie. It behoueth vs therfore, O my ſoule, diligentlie to ponder, weigh and conſider of theſe things: that now at the laſt we may, not onelie vnfeinedlie and thoroughlie trie, prooue, and examine our ſelues, our owne conſciences and liues: but alſo humblie acknowledging our faults vnto God, hartilie repenting our former ſinfull life, aſking mercie of GOD the Father for Chriſts ſake, and gladlie forgiuing all our offenders, effectuallie and carefullie there withall plucke vp, euen the verie roots of heatheniſh infidelitie, and all diſtruſt in Gods mercifull promiſes, to the end we may thereby, in verie deed, ſhew our ſelues liuelie

plants of the fruitfull oliue, liuing branches of the true vine, and woorthie members of Chriſts myſticall bodie; euen ſuch as haue our life, our abiding, our vnion, and as it were our incorporation with him.
                        Finallie, O my ſoule; we muſt not now, like chattering Iaies, ſo much regard or conſider theſe earthlie elements, and terrene creatures, which we ſee with our corporall eie, and ſtill remaine ſo: but eſpeciallie and in deed haue reſpect to the heauenlie graces and benefits, which our faith beholdeth in and by them. Neither muſt we by anie meanes cleaue to theſe inferiour or baſe things, which lie here beneath, and are viſiblie diſcerned: but leauing them altogether, wee muſt rather reſemble and plaie the parts of the Egles, who flie & mount vp thither, where the dead bodie lieth; that is, giuing credit to the words of Chriſt, who ſaith: The words that I ſpeake are ſpirit and life. And againe; remembering that God willeth ſuch as will be true worſhippers of him, to worſhip him in ſpirit and truth, we muſt now ſo behold the bread and wine with our naturall eies, that we may neuertheleſſe eſpeciallie lift vp the eies of our mind to heauen, and looke vp by faith vpon the holie bodie and bloud of our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, God and man, as he is there ſitting at the right hand of God his Father, in equall glorie, power, and maieſtie: alwaies ſeeking it there, where the ſunne of righteouſneſſe euermore ſhineth; continuallie holding faſt, and ſtill cleauing by faith onlie to the rocke, whence we may ſucke in deed the ſweetnes of euerlaſting ſaluatin. So ſhall we, O my ſoule, now repenting hartilie our former fowle life, being in perfect loue and charitie with all men, maruelling with reuerence and feare at theſe ſacred things; now touching theſe holie and fearfull myſteries with our mind, receiuing them with the hand of our hart, and taking them fullie with our inward

man by faith onelie, be ſure at this holie table euen now preſentlie to receiue; not onlie the outward Sacrament; but the ſpirituall thing alſo; not the figure, but the truth; not the ſhadowe, but the bodie: and that not to death, but to life; not to our deſtruction, but to our ſaluation: which God, euen our owne God, for his mercies ſake grant vs now effectuallie to doo, through the onelie merits of our Lord and Sauiour Jeſus Chriſt: to whom be all honour, glorie, dominion, power and praiſe, for euer and euer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        The praier.
                        
                           ALmightie and moſt mercifull God, my heauenlie Father; I thy poore child, and moſt vnwoorthie bidden gheſt to this thy prepared ſacrifice and celeſtiall feaſt, after due examination of my former life, with an humble and contrite hart, with a ſorowfull and repentant ſpirit, and with a forgiuing and charitable mind, heere proſtrate on my knees before thy throne of mercie, with moſt lowelie hart, humblie beſeech thy Maieſtie, (euen for thy deere and onelie ſonne Ieſus Chriſts ſake, whom thou haſt once for all euer, alreadie giuen an oblation and offering for our ſinnes) to haue mercie, pitie, and compaſſion vpon me, moſt vile, wretched, and miſerable ſinner; and to forgiue me all mine innumerable and horrible offences, both old and new, committed againſt heauen and earth, and againſt thee. And new I praie thee, ſanctifie me throughlie, O God; and make me, who hartilie deſire in feare & trembling to pleaſe thee in all things that I doo, a woorthie communicant, a godlie gheſt, and fit partaker heere this daie of thy heauenlie food, in this great and ſumptuous Supper of my Lord and my God: by giuing vnto me of thine

accuſtomed goodneſſe, the right knowledge and vnderſtanding out thy word, of the thing it ſelfe; theſe holie myſteries, I meane, and the manifold fruits and benefites thereof, and alſo by cauſing me, through the working of thy mercie and grace, to bring now with me a true and conſtant faith, the roote and wel-ſpring of all newneſſe of life, as well in praiſing thee, and louing my neighbour, as purging mine owne conſcience by earneſt repentance, and continuall contrition, from dead works and filthineſſe of ſinne; ſo that, neither the ignorance of the thing, O gratious God, may cauſe me to contemne it, nor vnfaithfulneſſe make it void of fruit, nor ſinne and iniquitie procure me thy heauie plagues; but grant that I may, by faith in knowledge and amendment of life, in faith be heere now ſo vnited to thy ſonne Chriſt my head, and moſt deerelie beloued ſpouſe, in theſe his holie and heauenlie myſteries, to my comfort both in bodie and ſoule, that afterward I may haue full fruition of him in deede, to mine euerlaſting ioie and ſaluation in eternall life, through the ſame Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, bleſſed for euer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another godlie praier.
                        
                           O Ieſu Chriſt, holy and eternall God, I miſerable woman, and wretched ſinner, acknowledge and confeſſe, that I am not woorthie the leaſt of all thy mercies, and moſt vnwoorthie to receiue thee vnder the roofe of my ſoule, by participating of thy moſt bleſſed bodie and bloud. For horrible and infinite are the ſinnes, wherewith I am defiled. Wo is me, Lord. For I am a woman of polluted lips, and dwell among people that haue vncleane lips. And therefore the verie entrailes of my hart are troubled, and my bones doo ſhake, becauſe I finde my

ſoule a moſt vnworthie gheſt for ſo heauenlie a ſupper. And yet againe, mine hart is woonderfullie lightned, when I call to mind, that thou, the deere ſonne of almightie God, cameſt not into this world to call the righteous, but ſinners vnto repentance. For they that be whole, need not the Phyſician, but they that are ſick. Beſides, I knowe right well, and conſtantlie doo beleeue, that notwithſtanding my filthineſſe, thou canſt make mee woorthie; which alone canſt make that cleane, which is conceiued of vncleane ſeed, and righteous men of ſinners, when thou forgiueſt our ſinnes of thy woonted grace, thine holie ſpirit being powred vpon vs. Through which thy power and mercie, I beſeech thee, graunt ſuch grace vnto me a ſinner, that I may woorthilie approch to this heauenlie ſacrament; leaſt otherwiſe by mine vnwoorthineſſe I be made giltie of thy bodie and bloud, and ſo in ſtead of life, receiue my iudgement and condemnation.
                        Giue grace therefore, that afore I preſume to come vnto the participation thereof, I may examine my ſelfe, by calling my ſinnes into mind, ſearching out my waies, and by vnfeigned and hartie repentance returning vnto thee my Lord; leaſt otherwiſe, by concealing my ſinnes with Iudas the traitor, I eate the bread of the Lord againſt the Lord; and by abuſing thy gentleneſſe, heape vengeance vnto my ſelfe againſt the daie of vengeance. O make me therefore, I ſaie, to confeſſe my ſinnes, and that with hartie ſobs; ſo thou, being a faithfull and iuſt God, wilt abandon all mine offences, and cleanſe me from my ſinnes, and wilt not diſdaine to accept me into fauour, when I doo not refraine to acknowledge my wickedneſſe.
                        Moreouer, powre into me a true and liuelie faith, that I neuer miſtruſt thy word annexed to the Sacraments, which promiſeth vnto mankind the remiſſion of ſinnes. For to eate or drinke with the mouth onelie,

is to no purpoſe; but faith muſt come therevnto, and apprehend the word with the promiſes annexed: for they are the grounds and principles of this ſacrament: ſo that, whoſoeuer giueth credit to theſe words, Which was giuen and ſhead for you, in the remiſſion of ſinnes; the ſame man hath that, which is promiſed by them, namelie, eternall life and ſaluation. For where the remiſſion of ſinnes is, there likewiſe righteouſnes, life and ſaluation is. But he which doubteth of theſe words, he without doubt is an vnworthie receiuer, and commeth vnprepared. For the doubting man neither eateth the fleſh ſpirituallie, nor yet drinketh the bloud; though carnallie, and to our eies he ſeemeth to conſume the Sacrament of the bodie and bloud with his teeth and mouth, but his damnation rather; not bicauſe thy ſupper is poiſon, but for that an euill man taketh a good thing naughtilie.
                        Finallie, grant alſo, that receiuing this thy Sacrament of the new Teſtament, I may put off, according to the former conuerſation, the old man, which is corrupt according to the luſts of error, and be renewed in the ſpirit of my mind, putting on the new man, which after God is ſhapen in righteouſneſſe and holineſſe of truth. And albeit my nature be ſuch, that I can not liue without ſpots of wickedneſſe; yet ſo bleſſe me, that I may neuer offend willinglie, but altogether depending vpon thy goodneſſe, whoſe manner is to pardon the true penitent, that ſinners may boldlie approch to thine holie ſupper; eſpeciallie, ſeeing we haue libertie to enter into the holie places, through thy bloud, by the new and liuing waie, which thou haſt prepared for vs, through the vaile, that is, by thy fleſh. And ſeeing we haue an high Prieſt ouer the houſe of God, make vs to drawe nigh with true harts, in aſſurance of faith, ſprinkled in our minds from an euill conſcience, and waſhed in bodie with pure water. Cauſe vs to

hold faſt the profeſſion of the hope without wauering. For he is faithfull that promiſed: and let vs conſider one of another, to prouoke vnto loue, & to good works; not forſaking the aſſemblie of the faithfull, as the maner of ſome is; but exhorting one another, and ſo much the more as we ſee the daie approching,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another moſt Chriſtian and deuout praier, to be ſaid before the receiuing of the holie Communion.
                        
                        
                           O Chriſt our Lord and Sauior, which before thy greeuous agonie, and heapes of trouble, thorough the wrath of thine almightie Father lighting vpon thee, commandedſt thy Diſciples Peter and Iohn to prepare the paſſouer, that together they might eate the ſame. Thou longedſt for our ſaluation, and didſt eate of the lambe, which was a figure of thy ſelfe; and expreſſedſt the image of that banket, which thy people the Iſraelits, vnder the conduction of thy ſeruant Moſes, about to depart out of Aegypt, did celebrate. Hauing finiſhed the ſupper of the old couenant, thou beganneſt a new couenant, teſtifieng of thy preſence and benefits in the Church. Mooue thou our harts to thankfulneſſe, that with like deſire we may deſire to come vnto thy table, and ſeeke the nouriſhment to eternall life. Suffer vs not to loath thine heauenlie banket, as prophane and curious men doo, which contend with thee, & contemne the order which thou haſt appointed. Amend all abuſes and prophanings of thine holie table, horriblie deformed with filthineſſe; for the which we are puniſhed in all places with manifold plagues and diſeaſes. By thy wiſedome thou healeſt our diſeaſes and infirmities, and by the viſible ſignes of Sacraments thou confirmeſt our faith. Thou art effectuall by them in

the beleeuers, according to thy promiſe. We bleſſe the bread and wine as thou haſt willed; and beleeue that with them we receiue thee in true faith and puritie of mind.
                        Thou declareſt by this thy Supper, that trulie thou tookedſt our fleſh vpon thee, for our ſakes; euen to ingraffe vs to thine owne fleſh, and bring vs to eternall life. This is eternall life, which is begunne in this world, whereby the ſoule is renewed vnto eternall happineſſe.
                        Moreouer, this bleſſed meate doth witneſſe and teſtifie, that our bodies, which are repleniſhed with the ſenſe of thy liuing fleſh, ſhall riſe againe to perpetuall glorie. Increaſe and nouriſh, by the profitable taking of thee, this light within vs. Worke, that thy Sacraments taken and digeſted, thou maiſt come into vs, and we into thee. Aſſiſt vs thy gheſts, O ſweet houſholder; that woorthilie we may feed vpon thy meate. Trie our ſoule with earneſt and vnfeined conuerſion. Let vs not plaie the hypocrites, nor prophanelie dallie with thee and thy holie Sacraments. Cauſe vs rightlie to diſcerne thy bodie and bloud from other common meate. Let vs neuer eate the bodie of the Lord againſt the Lord. Grant in true and vnfeined faith we may enter into this thy ſacred couenant, that we may alwaies abide in thee, and thou in vs.
                        Likewiſe, by thine holie ſpirit, which is the bond of loue, in this publike and common banket, ioine vs to thine other members of thy Church. Giue grace, that all which feed of this bread, may be one bodie, knit vnto thee, which art the head, working all things in all. Let the diuell at no time diſturbe this pleaſant concord betweene thee and vs, as is betweene the head and other members of the bodie.
                        Let vs gather alſo by the ſame, the ſumme of doctrine which is preached in the Church. Let it raiſe vs vp

vnto thankfulneſſe for thy benefits. Increaſe our deſire to continuall praier, whereby we craue all things which we ſtand in need of. Continue that cuſtome, euen till thou returneſt gloriouſlie in the clouds to iudgement. Maintaine ſome places for preaching, and godlie ceremonies, and bring in at no time barbarous ignorance.
                        Furthermore, the dooing herof is a miniſterie of our profeſſion, againſt Sathan and all his inſtruments. Confirme in our minds, by thy ſpirit, this ſound and pure vnderſtanding. Let vs not be oppreſſed with idolatrous darkneſſe, approouing horrible abuſes; in carrieng about, in laieng vp, in offring the halowed bread without any vſe: not ſo much as one ſillable of all theſe things can be ſeene in thy firſt inſtitution. Wherefore, repreſſe the diuell, blaſphemouſlie dealing with this thine ordinance. And firſt conſume this world vtterlie with fire, before we be wrapped againe in ſuch horrible darkneſſe of idolatrie and ſuperſtition. Mitigate the puniſhments, ſickneſſe, infections, warre and miſeries, which for the prophaning of this Supper, the whole world doth endure. Let thine Angel ſpare ſuch, as with griefe of hart bewaile theſe abuſes. Feed vs, and fill vs thy gheſts with thy liuelie preſence. Dwell thou in vs. Worke in vs. Sharpen the remembrance of thy benefits within vs. And finallie, at our reſurrection from the graue, giue vs a place in thy ſeat; where we ſhall find a new taſte in the kingdome of thy Father: So be it.
                        
                     
                     
                        Another praier to be ſaid before the receiuing of the bleſſed Communion, as you kneele at Gods boord.
                        
                        
                           O Lord, although I be not woorthie to receiue thee into the houſe of my ſoule, for mine innumerable offences and ſins done againſt thy great goodneſſe: yet truſting, good Lord, in

thy great pitie and infinite mercie, I come to receiue thy bleſſed bodie; as a ſicke creature, to thee that art the health of life; vncleane, to thee that art the well of mercie; blind by ignorance, to thee that art the light euerlaſting; needie of thy grace, and poore in vertue, to thee that art the King of heauen and earth; naked of good works, to thee that art the author of grace. I come as a wretch, to thee my Lord and maker; all deſolate and comfortleſſe, to thee my helpe and ſuccour. For beſides thee there is no conſolation. I come as a ſinner, to thee that art the mediatour and meane betwixt God and man. I come as a caitife, to thee my moſt mercifull Sauiour. I come all ſinfull, to thee the granter of remiſſion and pardon; dead by ſinne, to thee that art the reſtorer to life; euill, to thee that art all goodneſſe; hard-harted, to be releeued by the infuſion of thy ſuper-abundant grace; deſiring thee meekelie to heale mine infirmities and ſickneſſe, to waſh awaie my ſinne and filthineſſe, to lighten my blindneſſe, to reduce me to the right waie, where I am out thereof, to comfort me deſolate of goodneſſe. Haue mercie on my wretchedneſſe, pardon my ſinfulnes, giue me the light of grace (thus burdened in ſinne,) that I may receiue thee the food of all Angels, the King of glorie, the Lord of all lords, with ſuch chaſtitie of bodie, with ſuch pureneſſe of mind, and cleanneſſe of ſoule, with ſuch contrition of hart, and abundance of weeping teares, with ſuch ſpirituall ioie and gladneſſe, with ſuch dread and reuerence, with ſuch faith, hope and charitie, with ſuch obedience and humilitie, with ſuch loue, deuotion, faithfulneſſe and thankfulneſſe; as it is beſeeming for ſuch a Lord to be receiued, and to my ſoule moſt expedient.
                        And be not diſpleaſed, good Lord, that I a ſinner, with an vncleane hart and polluted mind come hither this daie, to receiue thy pretious bodie in ſacramentall

bread and wine: but remember, mercifull Lord, that thou refuſedſt not the ſinfull Marie Magdalen, being penitent, from the kiſſing of thy bleſſed feet. And in likewiſe deſpiſe me not, nor put me awaie as vnwoorthie, from the receiuing of thy bodie in the bleſſed Sacrament, for my ſinnes and wickedneſſe: but grant thou me cōpunction of hart, plentie of weeping tears, to waſh awaie my ſinnes & wickedneſſe; ſo that with a pure hart and cleane conſcience, I may this daie receiue the Sacrament to my ſoules helth; that I may obtaine and poſſeſſe thereby euerlaſting life, with all holie Saints in heauens glorie; and in this preſent life, with the holie ſpirit to be repleniſhed, and neuer to admit other louer beſides thee.
                        Grant me, bleſſed Ieſu, ſo to receiue the Sacrament of bread and wine, that I may be woorthie to bee accounted for a member of thy myſticall bodie heere in earth. And though as yet I be not worthie to be numbered among the ſimpleſt, and loweſt of thy ſeruants; but rather to be reiect and out-caſt for my ſinfulneſſe: yet, good Lord, of thine infinite power thou maiſt make me able, equall, and like to the meaneſt of thine elect ſeruants. Come thou Father of the fatherleſſe; come thou comforter of the comfortleſſe; come and cleanſe my ſoule from all contagiouſneſſe of ſinne. For it is not conuenient, and according, there to be anie vncleannes, where thou, the ſpouſe of virginall chaſtitie ſhouldeſt come in and dwell. Come therefore, and ſanctifie my ſoule, and make it cleane by thy gratious preſence; that no heapes of ſoile, or remnants of ſinne be to be found in anie leaſt cranie or corner of thy ſpirituall houſe or temple, (my bodie and ſoule I meane) to offend the celeſtiall eies of thy diuine Maieſtie: ſo ſhall thy holie hall, which is my cleanſed ſoule, ring and reſound with thy perpetuall praiſes to thy glorie. Come, I ſaie, O God, and apparell my naked ſoule with the

rich ornaments of thy vertue and grace, and with the white raines of thy righteouſneſſe and innocencie; that I may delight thee, therein to abide. And as thou diſdainedſt not to touch the ſore leapers with thy holie hands: ſo, good Lord, vouchſafe to annoint my ſimple ſoule, with the ointment of remiſſion and pardon; that in this life, by ſtedfaſt hope, firme faith, and perfect charitie, I may ſo increaſe in vertue, from daie to daie, that I may atteine to the glorious fruition of thy Godhead in the kingdome of heauen: where I may ſee thee face to face, and praiſe thee with all thine elect and choſen Saints, worlds without end,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another verie deuout praier, before the receiuing of the holie Communion.
                        
                        
                           
                              O
                            Moſt ſweet and louing Lord Ieſu Chriſt, whom now I deuoutlie and hartilie deſire to receiue this daie: thou knoweſt mine infirmities and neceſſities, which I ſuffer; in how manie euils and vices I lie, wherewith I am often greeued, tempted, troubled, and vnquieted, and defiled. Unto thee doo I come for remedie, vnto thee doo I earneſtlie praie for comfort and helpe. I ſpeake vnto thee, who knoweſt all things; vnto whom, euen all my verie ſecret thoughts are manifeſt; and who onlie canſt perfectlie comfort and helpe me. Thou knoweſt what good things I lacke before all things, and how poore and beggerlie I am in vertues. Behold, I ſtand before thee, requiring grace and mercie. Feed and cheriſh thy hungrie begger, kindle my coldneſſe with the fire of thy loue, lighten my blindneſſe with the bright cleereneſſe of thy preſence: turne all earthlie things into bitterneſſe vnto me; all heauie, greeuous, hard, painfull, and contrarie things, into patience to me. Lift vp

my hart vnto thee in heauen, and ſuffer me not to wander or go aſtraie from thee vpon the earth. Thou onlie, from this time foorth for euermore, dooeſt waxe ſweet vnto me, becauſe thou onelie art my meate and my drinke, my loue, my ioie, my ſweetneſſe. Oh, would to God thou wouldeſt vouchſafe altogether to enflame, burne, and euen conſume me with thy preſence; and to change me into thy ſelfe, that I may be made one ſpirit with them by grace of the inward vnitie, and ſoftning of thy feruent loue! Suffer me not to depart an hungred nor thirſtie from them, but worke mercifullie with me, as thou haſt often heeretofore maruellouſlie wrought with thy Saincts. What maruell is it, if I ſhould be altogether ſet on fire, & inflamed with thee, and ſhould faile in my ſelfe, and be changed? Sith thou art a fire euer burning, and neuer failing; a loue purifieng the hart, and lightening the vnderſtanding.
                        Behold therefore, I wretched ſinner, not preſuming of mine owne merits, but truſting onlie of thy mercie and goodneſſe, am bold to come in trembling and feare vnto this thy table of moſt ſweete deinties, O moſt holie Lord Ieſu Chriſt. For I haue an hart and bodie defiled, marred, and polluted with manie faults and offences; a mind and a tongue not chaſtlie nor warilie kept. Therefore, O holie Deitie, O dredfull Maieſtie, I wretched caitife, in great perplexitie of mind, taken vnwares betwene many troublſome ſtraights, doo now run againe to thee, the fountaine of all mercie. Unto thee doo I haſten me, to be healed and cured: vnder thy protection doo I flie. And whome I can not endure as a Iudge, I earneſtlie deſire to haue a Sauiour. To thee, O Lord, doo I open and ſhew my woundes; vnto thee doo I vncouer and detect my ſhamefaſtneſſe. I knowe that my ſinnes are great, for the which I am ſore afraid; but I hope and repoſe my truſt in thy great mercies, which are infinite, ſurpaſſing

number. Turne thine eies of thy mercie towards me, O Lord Ieſu Chriſt, heauenlie King, euerlaſting God, man crucified for man; heare me truſting in thee, and haue mercie vpon me full of all miſerie and ſinne. Thou which art the flowing fountaine, and vndrainable wel-ſpring of all mercie and pitie, I beſeech thee from the bottome of my hart, that thou wilt forgiue me all my ſinnes, and in this life ſo to purge awaie the ruſt and filth thereof, that in the life to come they may not be imputed vnto me.
                        O God of vnſpeakable pitie, whoſe power is infinite, without whome I can not poſſiblie reſiſt ſinne, comfort and helpe me ſo greatlie, that I neuer heereafter anie more commit anie mortall or deadlie ſinne; and from hencefoorth may ouercome all the temptations of the diuell, that I may direct my whole life, thoughts, words and works altogether vnto thee, and that thou maiſt in the end of my life, ſo preſerue and keepe me, that Sathan vrge me not with his terrours and feares, and ſo bring me into deſperation. O flowing fountaine of charitie, make my mind free from all the creatures, which might drawe me from thy loue and fauour, that in thy loue I may profit, go forward, and preuaile; that now verelie, and in the end of my life, I may worthilie receiue thee, and ſo my ſoule being powred out of the ſacke of my bodie, doo thou in mercie bring it vnto the euerlaſting palace of thy heauenlie father, to ſee and behold the cleere renowmed glaſſe of the holie Trinitie.
                        Remember thy creature, O Lord, whome thou haſt redeemed with thy pretious bloud. Wo is me that euer I haue offended thee; but now I purpoſe, by thy grace, to amend my life. Take from me therefore, O mercifull father, all my ſinnes and iniquities. Caſt out of my ſoule all the filthie fowle matter of the venemous contagion and infection of ſinne, and by thine

ancient and accuſtomed mercies, powre thy heauenlie medicine, and preſeruatiue of thy loue, into my wounds, which may refreſh and reſtore me to my former puritie and cleanneſſe, that being purified both in bodie and mind, I may deſerue and be made fit thorough Chriſts merits, woorthilie to taſt of theſe moſt holie myſteries.
                        Come this daie, O Lord, and miniſter vnto my ſicke and languiſhing ſoule ſome heauenlie cordiall of comfort, not becauſe I am iuſt, but a ſinner; becauſe not the whole, but the ſicke haue neede of a Phyſician. O verie true Charitie, in which is euerlaſting felicitie! O the onlie hope of my ſoule! haue mercie vpon me, and blot out all my miſdeeds. Thee doth my hart expect and deſire, fulfill my luſt and longing, which thou haſt put in me, euen as thou wouldeſt. I am thine, O Chriſt, forſake me not as vnmeete, or a ſtranger. Let thy right hand alwaie preuent me, and defend me from all euill. Come, O Lord, whome I wretch haue ſore offended, and forgiue and forget all mine offences, for the which thou haſt ſhead thine owne moſt pretious hart bloud. Come, ſweet Lord, and giue me the meate of eternall health. Come, O vnſpotted ſacrifice, deliuer me from euerlaſting death. Come thou Phyſician of the weake and diſeaſed. Come thou food of the hungrie. Come Lord, viſit this houſe dedicated and conſecrated in thy name. And behold I come to thee, whome with all my hart I couet and deſire, towards whome with all earneſt conſideration of mind, I aſpire, and ſtudie to attaine; whome with all mine entrailes I hartilie loue and embrace; whoſe bleſſed bodie and bloud in theſe holie myſteries I earneſtlie deſire to receiue; that thou maiſt alwaies abide in me, and neuer forſake me, or depart from me, O moſt ſweet father: So be it.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                        Another.
                        
                           ALmightie God, and moſt mercifull Father, who moſt louinglie calleſt vs to the participation of all good things in Chriſt Ieſu, giue vs alſo grace woorthilie to eſteeme the honour thou vouchſafeſt vs of, in bidding vs to the marriage feaſt of thy Sonne, ſo that we may eſteeme of nothing in compariſon of it. And ſeeing few are choſen, though manie be called, giue vs alſo, O Lord, a liuelie faith, working by loue, as a ſeemelie garment for ſo great a ſolemnitie; that being entred by thy fauour into thy houſe, we diſhoneſt it not, and ſo honourable a companie as thou haſt called vnto it, by our wicked conuerſation, that as vnwoorthie we be not caſt out againe, but in all our behauiour, may doo honour vnto both, that we may alwaies remaine with thee, and enioie the happineſſe thou haſt prepared for vs in thy Sonne, the full fruition whereof becauſe thou haſt deferred to the riſing vp againe of the dead, ſtrengthen in vs, O Lord, the bleſſed hope of this reſurrection, that according to thy promiſe thou maiſt make vs like to thine Angels that are in heauen, and the glorious eſtate of Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, to whom with thee, and the holie Ghoſt, be all honour and praiſe now and for euer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another.
                        
                           
                              O
                            Sonne of God, Lord and Sauiour Chriſt, which delighteſt in thoſe bankets, whereby men approch to the companie of thy celeſtiall wel-fare; we beſeech thee conuert vs, O Lord, and we ſhall be conuerted. Graunt that with Marie Magdalen caſting our

ſelues before thy feete, we may earneſtlie with teares bewaile our offences; and againe lifting vp our hand vnto thee, we may laie hold on thee, and embrace thee as ſhe did. Kiſſe thou vs with thine holie kiſſe, and by thy ſpirit powred into vs, ſtirre vp in vs a new life, which may annoint thee by true confeſſing of thy goodneſſe, and delight thee with the ſweet ſauour of true inuocation and new obedience.
                        Grant alſo, that in this life we may worſhip thy feet, which bring tidings of peace. And foraſmuch as in this laſt age of this world, the meſſengers of peace are vitterlie to weepe; aſſiſt vs, that we may be touched with the miſeries of thy Church, and ſtudie to our power to mitigate them, and ſo be made members of that companie, vnto whome thou haſt forgiuen much, and which againe entirelie doth loue thee: and againe, being called out of the vale of teares, may come to thy heauenlie banket, which ſhall be without teares, without grudging, without greefe, ſinne, and offences, in the houſe of thy father, where be manie ample dwelling places,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another praier to be ſaid a little before you receiue the Bread.
                        
                        
                           
                              O
                            God which art rich in mercie and in all good things, the moſt plentifull giuer and bountifull beſtower of the deinties of celeſtiall ſatietie and heauenlie repaſt, giue meate to my ſoule that is wearie and faint; not ſuch as it luſteth after, but ſuch as is conuenient for it. For lo, I a poore wretch come now vnto thee, which art rich, a ſinner vnto thee which art mercifull. O let me not returne home contemned and deſpiſed with nothing. I begin an hungred, let me not leaue off faſting.

I come vnto thee as though I were famiſhed, O let me not go awaie vnfed. Although before I eate I ſigh and ſorowe, yet good Lord I beſeech thee, giue mee ſomewhat to eate.
                        For behold, with that godlie heroicall matrone of Canaan, Matth. 15, verſe 21. I come vnto thee, and ſaie, Lord helpe me, according to thy promiſe: for I feele the burthen of thy diſpleaſure, euen my miſeries and vncleanneſſe, and ſuffer not the ſight of mine owne vnwoorthineſſe to withdrawe me from thee. Make me ſweetlie and reuerentlie to reaſon with thee, as thy holie ſpirit enforced that good woman to doo, in theſe and the like words: I am vnwoorthie, I am giltie and vncleane, I am a dog, I was an outcaſt from thy houſe and courts, I haue barked againſt the glorious maieſtie of thee and thine eternall father, I am defiled with the filth of idolatrie, with fowleneſſe of life, with the ſpots of diſobedience againſt thee, but haue mercie vpon me O ſonne of God, which appearedſt in the fleſh, and becameſt a worme, to waſh vs from our ſinnes which were vncleane beaſts. Haue mercie vpon me; O Lord haue mercie vpon me. For behold, I am vnto thee euen as the little whelpe nigh famiſhed for lacke of meate and drinke, wearied with ſeeking about for releefe; and almoſt dead. I fall downe before thy glorious table, where the ſweet ypocraſſe, and pretious nectar of immortalitie is taſted. The Fathers & Prophets, Confeſſors and Virgins, moſt excellent lights of thy Church, ſit alreadie at thine heauenlie table: they feede vpon the meate of eternall glorie. O ſuffer me to eate of the crums. Thou art the bread of life, repell my hunger, ſatiſfie my deſire with thy preſence; fill me with thy comfort & ſpirituall deinties. Make my faith ſtrong to beleeue thy word and promiſes, that being made holie, as thou art holie, I may now holilie taſte and ſee how ſweet thou art in this life by inchoation,

and in the life to come, perfectlie, pleaſantlie, and perpetuallie enioie thy heauenlie table.
                        O our Father, giue vs this daie our dailie bread, that we may walke in the ſtrength thereof daie and night, vntill we come to thy holie hill of Horeb. My ſweet Lord, let me feed vpon thee. My life enter into my ſoule. O ſweet loue, O louing ſweetneſſe, let my bellie eate thee, and my ſoule be refreſhed by thee the heauenlie Bridegrome. For thou art the bread and fountaine of life, yea all things indeede whereby the righteous liue, which loue thee. Thee doo I couet, loue and woorſhip, with whome I ſhall dwell, reigne, and be bleſſed. Upon thee doo I call for my ſoule, which thou prepareſt to receiue thee, through the deſire which thou breatheſt into it. Come therefore, O purger of ſinnes, thou which art the curer of wounds, the ſtrength of the feeble, the comforter of the ſorowfull, the worſhip and honour of all them that liue, and the onelie health of the dead. Come I ſaie, O bleſſed Trinitie, and enter into my ſoule; come I beſeech thee, and haue mercie vpon me: make me meete for thee, that thou maiſt poſſeſſe that which thou haſt both made and redeemed, ſanctified and preſerued, that I may haue thee as a ſeale vpon my hart. Giue me thy ſelfe O God my God, reſtore thy ſelfe vnto me, for nothing elſe can ſuffice thy ſeruant; and mercifullie graunt vnto me according to the multitude of thy great mercies, that my baſeneſſe may pleaſe thy Maieſtie, & my vileneſſe thine almightie power.
                        O ſweet Chriſt, O Charitie, my God, dulcet honie, ſnowie milke, the foode of Angels; make me to growe in thee, that I may eate thee with a ſauorie taſte. Make me to ouercome the enimie of my ſaluation, that thou maiſt vouchſafe to giue me (according to thy promiſe) to eate of the tree of life, which is in the middeſt of the Paradiſe of God, and of the Manna that is

hid; and that I may one daie or other be called vnto the Lambes ſupper, and eate bread at thy table in the kingdome of GOD, among the bleſſed ones. O deere God, I praie thee, let my mind thus kindeled with the loue of thee, flie euen till it come to the beautie of thy celeſtiall houſe, & to the throne of thy glorie, and there let it be fed at the dining table of the heauenlie citizens, in the place of full feeding, by the plentifull running ſtreames and pleaſant paſtures. Behold Lord, I ſtand at the doore and knocke; I beſeech thee, by the bowels of thy mercie, wherewith thou being the daie-ſpring from an high haſt viſited vs; open the hand of thy pitie to a wretch that knocketh, and vouchſafe mercifullie to bid me enter into thee; that I may reſt with thee; dwell with thee, and ſup with thee, and thou with me, and that I may be refreſhed to the full of thee, which art the liuing ſweet white-bread and heauenlie repaſt: wherewith when I am once fed; and that my ſtrength is come perfectlie vnto me againe, I may aſcend vnto the more high things, & neuer from hencefoorth hunger or thirſt anie more ſo greatlie after vanities: So be it.
                        
                     
                     
                        When ye are about to receiue the bread, lift vp your hart and eies vnto God in heauen, and ſaie:
                        
                        
                           O Father, I hartilie thanke thee, who haſt giuen thine onlie begotten ſon to take vpon him our naturall bodie; which bodie was once offered to thee vpon the altar of the croſſe, for the health, welth, and ſaluation of all ſinners: for whoſe ſake, O father, I beſeech thee, to haue mercie vpon me; and in remembrance of whoſe moſt bitter death and painfull paſſion, with all poſſible thanks for all thy benefits brieflie compriſed therein; I now in

trembling and feare receiue this holie bread, to feed therby in my ſoule on Chriſts bleſſed bodie, which was giuen for me, and that onelie by faith: to mine euerlaſting comfort and ſaluation, and thine eternall glorie,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Or thus.
                        
                           O Heauenlie Father and bleſſed God, I render vnto thee moſt hartie thanks for all thy benefits, which thou haſt ſhewed vnto me moſt wretched ſinner: but eſpeciallie for that moſt ſweet ſmelling ſacrifice, which thine onlie begotten ſonne offered vnto thee on the altar of the croſſe, by giuing his moſt pure & vndefiled bodie vnto the death, for the redemption of mankind. In remēbrance wherof, according to thy welbeloued ſonnes ordinance, I now receiue this holie bread moſt intirelie, beſeeching thee that I may both be partaker of the merits of thy deere ſonnes bodie breaking, and alſo lead a life woorthie of ſo great a benefit vnto the glorie of thy name,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        When you ſee the wine, behold it with your corporall eies. For as Christ ſaith, it is wine: but lift vp your ſoule vnto Chriſt in heauen, whoſe bloud is there alwaie freſh and liuelie before the Father, to ſprinkle and quicken thee; and praie, ſaieng:
                        
                           O Lord Ieſu Chriſt, Sonne of the liuing GOD, which being vpon the croſſe, with thy hands ſpred abroad for the redemption of all mankind, diddeſt drinke the moſt bitter cup of thy paſſion: I beſeech thee, vouchſafe now to drawe the mouth of the ſoule that thirſteth after thee, vnto the high flouds and flowing ſtreames of thine eternall

abundance and ſatietie: yea drawe me wholie vnto thy ſelfe, which art the liuing well, to the intent I may according to my capacitie drinke of that wherevpon I doo liue.
                        O my God, my life, thou didſt ſaie with thy holie and bleſſed mouth; If anie man thirſt, let him come vnto me and drinke. O well of life, grant vnto my thirſtie ſoule alwaie to drinke of thee, that according to thy holie and true promiſe, waters of life may flowe out of my bellie. O well of life, repleniſh and fill my mind full of the riuer of thy pleaſures; make my hart to be drunken as it were in thy loue: that after the maner of them that be drunken with wine, which forget all things ſaue the cup; ſo I may forget all vaine and earthlie things, and continuallie haue nothing elſe in my remembrance, but thee onelie; thy bitter death, thy painfull paſſion, and pretious bloud-ſhedding. Come I praie thee, into my hart, and make it drunken with the abundance of thy plentifulneſſe, ſo that I may forget all temporall things; make me, I ſaie, throughlie drunken with thy cup, that I may forget euen my ſelfe, and vtterlie renounce all mine owne vngodlineſſe & ſinne.
                        O Chriſt, which art the euerlaſting ſuffiſance that ſhalt be giuen to the hungrie and thirſtie: refreſh vs continuallie with the moſt exquiſite and well furniſhed banket of thy bleſſed Sacraments, and make vs drinke plentiouſlie of the holie cup of thy bleſſed ſpirit and grace. Let the inſpiration of thy moſt ſweet ſpirit ſucceed like ſprings of water; and let not perpetuall food be wanting to our weakeneſſe, wherewith to feed and repleniſh vs. Let me taſte of the pleaſant riuers of the holie Ghoſt, that I may be refreſhed, and that my ſoule may be cooled with the ſweet liquors thereof; ſo that I burne hencefoorth with no iniquitie or luſt to ſinne. Make me to quaffe hartilie the cup of thankes-giuing: yea let my bowels be filled with the pleaſant

wine of thy loue, and refreſh me continuallie with the moſt ſweet riuers of thy heauenlie conſolation.
                        Thou art my life, whereby I liue; the hope that I ſticke vnto; the glorie that I deſire. O giue me vnderſtanding, cheere vp my loue. Lift thou vp my ſoule, and drawe the mouth of my ſpirit, which thirſteth after thee, vp to the water ſtreames that are aboue. Uouchſafe, ſweet Ieſu, in the midſt of my monings, ſore complaints, and deepe ſighs of my hart, to take vp my ſad and ſorowfull mind to the top of the high mountains, euen to the beds of ſweet ſpices, putting me in a place of paſture by the riuers of ſweet waters, where thou prepareſt a table, diuerſelie furniſhed for thy friends againſt they come: to refreſh mine appalled ſpirits; to cheere vp my heauie hart, & make it merie. Through the which deinties, I being at the length well refreſhed, may forget my manifold miſeries, and the vanities of this life; and reſt in thee, which art the true peace euerlaſting, paſſing all vnderſtanding.
                        Lord God, which art the ſanctifier of the Saints, I beſeech thee, conſecrate and make me meete for thy dwelling, and continue thou euer with me: vouchſafe all to beſprinkle me with the bloud of thy onlie begotten ſonne, by which one ſouereigne thing both in bodie and ſoule, I may be reuiued with a maruellous comfortable ioie. O Lord, theſe are thy great benefits, wherewith thou wilt releeue the want of thy thirſtie children: grant, I beſeech thee, that I may drinke on thy cup with a glad mind, willing hart, pure conſcience, and clenſed ſpirit: and bring to paſſe by thy mercie, that this drinke, which I ſhall now drinke, may be to my health and ſaluation. Finallie grant, O good God, that I may, through thy moſt rich ſpirit, and his eternall deinties, enioie the princelie palace of heauen, and quaffing verie abundantlie of the well-ſpring of life, which is with thee, I may by the excellent benefit

of thy glorious paſſion, death, reſurrection and light, behold the brightneſſe of perpetuall felicitie, and ſee thee face to face, where my mind may be fed and full ſatiate with the meate and drinke of life without end. For like as the hart thirſteth after the water ſprings: ſo thirſteth my ſoule after thee, O Lord my GOD and King,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        When you are about to receiue the wine or cup, praie:
                        
                        
                           I Thanke thee, deere father, that thou didſt not ſpare thine onelie and moſt deerlie beloued ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, to ſhed euen his moſt pretious bloud vpon the altar of the Croſſe for to waſh awaie our ſinnes. In remembrance whereof, I now in trembling and dread drinke of this cup: humblie beſeeching thee, O Father, that the crucifieng of his bleſſed bodie, and ſhedding of his pretious bloud may be meritorious to my ſaluation,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Or elſe thus.
                        
                           O Bleſſed and mercifull Father, thy loue towards me ſinfull creature is ſo exceeding great and vnſpeakable, that I can not but giue vnto thee moſt humble thanks: namelie, for the ſhedding of the moſt pretious blood of thy deere ſonne Ieſu Chriſt; by the vertue whereof, thy wrath ſtirred vp againſt me wretched ſinner, is pacified, my ranſome is paid, the lawe is fulfilled, mine enimies are ourcome, and put to flight. In remembrance of this ſo noble a victorie, and of ſo great a benefit, I am come vnto this thy table, O mercifull father, to drinke

of this cup; deſiring thee, that as my outward man is comforted by the drinking of this wine: ſo likewiſe my inward man may be comforted, and made ſtrong by true faith in the pretious blood of thy moſt deere ſonne. O Lord, and my heauenlie Father, giue me thy holie ſpirit, which may ſo rule and gouerne my hart, that I neuer be vnthankfull, nor forgetfull of this thine exceeding kindneſſe: but to traine my life according to thy bleſſed will, that whatſoeuer I doo, ſpeake or thinke, may be vnto the glorie of thy bleſſed name, and the health of my ſoule, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        After you haue receiued the holie Communion, giue God thanks, and ſaie:
                        
                        
                           I Thanke thee, good Lord, of thine infinite goodneſſe, that thou this daie haſt fed me with thy bleſſed bodie & bloud in the Sacrament; deſiring thee meeklie that this Sacrament which I haue receiued, may be to me a purgation and clenſing of my ſins; a fortitude & ſpiritual ſtrength againſt my frailtie; a ſure defence againſt worldlie troubles and aduerſities; a purchaſing of grace and pardon; a medicine of life; and a continuall remembrance of thy bleſſed paſſion: ſo that in the waie it may conduct me; when I ſtumble it may vphold me; and when I am fallen it may raiſe me: ſo that by good continuance in thy will, to euerlaſting glorie it may bring me. And ſo order the tallage and taſte of my hart, that I neuer ſeeke other ſweetneſſe, but thee; that I neuer ſeeke other louer, but thee; nor none other comfort beſide thee; ſo that I care for none other delight, but thee; nor anie other honour, but thine. And giue mee ſuch perfect loue towards thee, wherewith I may

come to as great merit in heauen, as though I had ſpent all my life daies in the remembrance of thy bleſſed paſſion, and gratiouſlie deliuer me from all tribulations of bodie and ſoule, captiuitie, anguiſh and perils. This grant not onlie vnto me, but alſo vnto all thine elect and choſen Chriſtian people heere and elſe-where, for thy holie name ſake,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another thanks-giuing after the Communion.
                        
                           I Thanke thee O Chriſt Lambe of God, for offering thy ſelfe vpon the altar of the croſſe to thy Father an offering and a ſacrifice of a ſweet ſauour to God, for our ſinnes, to reconcile vs vnto him: for certaintie whereof, and confirmation of our faith, thou haſt inſtituted on our behalfe this holie Sacrament of the ſupper, that as oft as we receiue the ſame, we may celebrate thy memorie, and with thankes-giuing remember the merit and fruit of thy paſſion. I beſeech thee by thy bitter death ſtirre vp our minds, that by often receiuing this thine ordinance and inſtitution, we may conſider how bitter a death thou didſt ſuffer on our behalfe, and how great the loue was, which draue thee to take ſo cruell and ſhamefull a death to ſaue vs: and withall continuallie yeeld, as we are bound, hartie thanks vnto thee for the ſame, and after the like ſort anſwer to our power, that vnſpeakable good will by our good life, and carefull obſeruation of thy commandements; and may when either through frailtie of our fleſh, or by anie other fault preuented we ſinne, runne by and by vnto thee by repentance, and through conſideration of this new and eternall couenant, touching the remiſſion of ſinnes made with vs, be erected and vpholden vnto a liuelie and puiſſant hope.
                        
                           
O ſweet Ieſu grant, that being faſt linked vnto thee by this holy myſterie, I may receiue power & ſtrength from thee, beleeuing thy promiſes, and be wholie addicted therevnto without anie doubting, that ſo my conſcience in feare and troubles may haue perfect conſolation. Suffer me not to be ſeparated from the members of thy bodie, which is the Church; whereof thou art head, fulfilling all in all: but graunt, that abiding in thy word and kingdome, I may be without fault in the foundation, and without ſinne againſt my conſcience, and walke worthie this Sacrament; forſaking vtterlie, and renouncing the diuell, and all idolatrie, all vices and carnall deſires, which fight againſt the ſoule. For we cannot be partakers of the Lords table, and of the diuels too. Make me alſo to remember that by this Sacrament I am bound to doo good vnto others. For, as manie graines of corne doo make one loafe, and manie grapes make one wine: ſo being manie, yet are we but one loafe and one bodie, in aſmuch as we all participate of one bread, and drinke of one cup. Ioine vs therefore togither, O Sauiour of the world, at this common banket, through the band of loue, that we may be faſtened vnto thee our head, that as thou didſt die for vs, ſo we againe may not feare to ſuffer, and to giue our liues for the glorie of thy name, that we neuer be ſeparated from thee neither in life nor death. Make vs alſo hartilie to loue one another, like the true and liuelie members of thy bodie, that if neede require, we may giue our liues for our brethren. Suffer not concord of minds to be broken. For he that receiueth the myſterie of vnitie, and keepeth not the bond of peace, he doth not receiue the myſterie for himſelfe, but a teſtimonie againſt himſelfe.
                        Giue grace therefore, that leauing aſide all wrath, fierceneſſe, maliciouſneſſe and enuie, we may forgiue one another, euen as thou forgiueſt vs, and beare one

with another for the better auoiding of ſtrife, diſſention, ſectes and pernicious hereſies. Keepe this thine ordinance, and right vſe of thy Sacrament amongſt vs euermore, that this good worke and diuine ceremonie may alwaies be a note and badge of our publike profeſſion, whereby we are knowne from pagans; and tokens of loue, confeſſion and thankefulneſſe. Remoue awaie all abuſes, and prophanations of this holie and ſacred ſupper, together with the horrible and idolatrous adorations inuented by Sathan and his members, to the ſhamefull deforming of thy godlie & goodlie inſtitution: but maintaine, I humblie beſeech thee, the true and vnpolluted vſe thereof, till thy pleaſure is to returne in the clouds to iudgement with great power and glorie, that it neuer be out of remembrance; and laſt of all, at our reſurrection from death, appoint vs places of thine heauenly table, where we may taſte the new wine in the kingdome of thy father, abiding with thine elect, Angels, and bleſſed Saincts for euermore,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        A meditation of the truſt which a Chriſtian ſoule ought to haue in the paſsion of our Lord Ieſu, with a thanks-giuing vnto God for the manifold benefits thereof.
                        
                        
                           I Might deſpaire verelie, becauſe of my manifold ſinnes and negligences without number; if it were not that thy word, O God, was made fleſh, and dwelt amongſt vs. But I can not, neither dare I now deſpaire; becauſe that ſeeing when we were enimies, we were reconciled by the death of thy Sonne, who being obedient vnto thee to the death, yea euen to the ſhamefull death of the Croſſe, hath taken awaie the hand-writing of our

ſinnes, and nailing the ſame to his croſſe, hath crucified both ſinne and death. How much more are we now reconciled, and ſaued by him? For all the hope, certitude, and ſureneſſe of all my truſt is in his pretious bloud, which was ſhead for vs, and for our ſaluation. In him doo I take hartening, and by meanes of him, who ſitteth at the right hand of God, and ſueth for vs, I looke backe with a careleſſe eie; and now truſting in him (in whome I am alreadie riſen againe and receiued, alreadie mounted vp into heauen, and there doo ſit among the Angels) I haue a deſire to come vnto thee, not hauing mine owne righteouſneſſe, but that which I haue through the ſame thy Sonne our Lord Ieſu Chriſt.
                        For the which, O moſt mercifull God, and moſt gentle louer of mankind, we giue thee thanks; who through Ieſus Chriſt thy Sonne our Lord, when we were not, didſt mightilie make vs, and when we were loſt through our ſinnes, moſt maruellouſlie didſt deliuer and recouer vs againe. To thy goodneſſe, I ſaie, doo I giue thanks, and manifold praiſes doo I ſhew foorth to thee with all my hart & mind, which through the vnſpeakable loue (wherewith thou haſt vouchſafed of thy maruellous goodneſſe to loue vs wretches, and vnworthie to be beloued) didſt ſend the ſame thine onelie begotten Sonne from thy boſome, vnto our Common-weale, to ſaue vs ſinners, which were at that time the children of perdition and damnation. I render vnto thee all poſſible thanks for his holie incarnation, and natiuitie, and for the bleſſed virgin Marie his mother, vpon whom he did vouchſafe to take fleſh for vs, and for our ſaluation, to the intent that like as he is verie God of God, ſo he might be verie man of man. I giue thee condigne thanks for his paſſion and croſſe; for his death and reſurrection; for his aſcenſion into heauen, and his ſeate of his Maieſtie on thy

right hand. I giue thee thanks, I ſaie, for that moſt ſacred ſhedding foorth of his pretious bloud, wherewith we are redeemed; and alſo for the moſt holie and quickening ſacrifice of his bleſſed bodie & bloud, which this daie, and dailie in thy Church we feed of, and drinke of, wherewith alſo we are waſhed, cleanſed, and ſanctified, & are made partakers of the onelie high diuinitie. Finallie, I giue thee thanks for the maruellous and vnſpeakable charitie and loue, wherewith thou didſt loue vs vnwoorthie perſons, and didſt ſaue vs by thine onelie and beloued ſonne. For ſo thou didſt loue the world, that thou gaueſt thine onlie begotten ſonne, to the intent that none, which trulie beleeue in him ſhuld periſh, but haue euerlaſting life. And this thing verilie is euerlaſting life, to knowe thee, and alſo Ieſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent, to be verie God, by an vpright faith, and works woorthie for ſuch a faith. Wherefore with all my hart and mouth I doo confeſſe, praiſe, and bleſſe thee, O God the father vnbegotten, and thee O God the ſonne onlie begotten; alſo thee O holie Ghoſt and comforter. To thee O bleſſed trinitie be all glorie, and praiſe, & thanks, togither with all power, dominion, and might, in the world of worlds for euer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        A meditation to be vſed after the receiuing of the holie Communion, to ſtirre vs vp through the conſideration and knowledge of ſo great a benefit, to giue God thanks therefore, and to be gratefull for his goodneſſe.
                        
                           BLeſſe the Lord O my ſoule, and all mine entrailes laud his moſt holie name. Forget not O my ſoule the infinite mercies and continuall benefits receiued of his moſt liberall hand; amongſt the which, well maiſt thou reckon that which hath been this daie giuen thee, that ſo infinite

a Maieſtie ſhould vouchſafe to viſite thee, to enter into thy homelie habitation, and with ſurpaſſing clemencie, wholie to giue himſelfe to thee in this moſt maruellous Sacrament.
                        O thou incomprehenſible God, no leſſe pitifull than puiſſant, what ſhall I ſaie, ſeeing the depth of thy bottomleſſe mercies hath vouchſafed to impart it ſelfe to the depth of mine vnſpekable miſeries! What thanks can I yeeld thee for ſo great kindneſſe and loue, who wot right well, that if all the members and muſcles of my bodie were turned into tongues, yet could I not condignelie thanke thee for the leaſt of all thy benefits. How much leſſe able ſhall I then be with one tongue to laud and thanke thee for this preſent gift, being of ſo great and ineſtimable a value?
                        If Elizabeth the mother of the fore-runner Saint Iohn Baptiſt, being viſited of the moſt ſacred virgin Marie thy mother, when ſhe perceiued thy preſence, illuminated with the holie Ghoſt, was ſo aſtoniſhed thereat, as ſhe cried out alowd, and ſaid; Whence haue I this, that the mother of my Lord dooth come to me? How much more iuſtlie am I to be aſtoniſhed, and to crie out; Whence haue I this, that the onlie ſonne of that moſt bleſſed virgin, euen my Lord himſelfe, and Lord of all Angels, heauen and earth, and of all the creatures of the world, hath viſited me, entred into me, honoured me, foſtered me, and filled me in this moſt woorthie Sacrament? Whence haue I this, that a Lord ſo high, ſo puiſſant, ſo woorthie of all worſhip, hath vouchſafed to come vnto mee a moſt wretched worme; to me the moſt heinous ſinner of all ſinners; to me that haue ſo manie times offended him, to me that with my lewdneſſe and abhominations haue ſo oft baniſhed and expelled him out of me?
                        Woorthilie did the holie Prophets Iob and Dauid, woonder at thy diuine clemencie, at what time

they ſaid; What is man that thou ſo magnifieſt him? What is the ſonne of man that thus thou viſiteſt him? But much greater reaſon haue we moſt wretched caitifs to ſaie the ſame in theſe our daies; What is man that thou haſt thus extolled him: as for man, to make thy ſelfe man, and to giue thy ſelfe in foode to man, wherewith he may euerie daie be viſited and refreſhed? And albeit all men may maruell at this thy diuine clemencie vſed towards man: much more yet may I maruell, which of all men am the baſeſt and vnwoorthieſt.
                        If Dauid, when king Saule would haue choſen him for his ſonne in lawe, reputed himſelfe vnwoorthie, and ſaid; What am I, or what is my life, or my fathers linage, that I ſhould be a ſonne in lawe to a king? How much more cauſe haue I now to ſaie the ſame; ſeeing the King of all kings hath admitted mee to ſo high a dignitie? What am I: or what is my fathers offſpring? What other am I, than a veſſell of corruption, a ſacke of doong; and filth ingendred of a moſt vile & ſtinking matter, touching my fleſh, which ere long ſhall yeeld food to woormes: and am concerning my ſoule all ſoiled with ſinne, fraught with ignorance and forgetfulneſſe, with manie mo defects, and wicked inclinations?
                        What other is my life than a vanitie, a puffe of wind, a ſmoke, and ſhadowe that quicklie vaniſheth, a confuſion and diſorder, a continuall exerciſe of ſinne and tranſgreſſions of thy commandements? Such hath my life, mine exerciſes, and mine inclinations beene; ſuch alſo is my father Adams offſpring, and all his ancient familie; ſith all that deſcend of him are generallie borne thus blemiſhed, thus bent, and all like children of a traitour, as he was adiudged to ſuffer death.
                        Wherefore, O moſt puiſſant Prince, and dreadfull

King aboue all kings, thou knowing me and my life to haue been ſuch, & much woorſe than I either knowe or can imagine, haſt vouchſafed to receiue me; not for a ſonne in lawe, but for thine owne child, and as a yoonger one right tenderlie beloued. For ſuch are fathers accuſtomed moſt of all to cheriſh; as now thou haſt cheriſhed and fed me with this Angels bread, wherein is found all ſauour, and all diuine delight.
                        S. Luke reporteth, how one of thoſe gheſts, that were at table with thee in a prince of the Phariſies houſe, ſhould ſaie; Bleſſed are thoſe that ſhall eate the bread of life in the kingdome of heauen: but much more happie am I, if I can knowe it, and gather fruit out of it, which in this life rate the bread, wherein is the ſelfe-ſame God ſpirituallie by faith conteined; and therewith receiue a pledge to eate him in his euerlaſting kingdome. Happie eke are all thoſe that ſhall diſpoſe themſelues to repaire to this moſt gratious banket, wherein are found all ſweet taſts and ſauours, all riches and renowme, and all the things that happilie be to be deſired.
                        Yea, what is it that man may long for, that is not here offered him? If he deſire delights and pleaſures; here be the ſincereſt, the choiſeſt, & the ſweeteſt. If he wiſh for wealth; behold here the treaſure that inricheth both heauen and earth. If ſtate and ſouereigntie be ſought for, behold here the higheſt dignities that can be poſſiblie atchieued. Sith by meanes of this moſt venerable ſacrament the ſoule is vnited to God, and reſteth aſſociated, and reuerenced with quires of Angels that aſſiſt about it.
                        Wherefore, O ye blind beguiled children of Adam, what other pleaſure & profit doo you prowle for? Why doo you (as Eſaie ſaith) ſpend your monie; and not vpon bread? Why imploie you your trauell. and not in this that may ſatiate and content you? Why looſe you

ſuch ſatietie, ſuch ſweetneſſe, and ſuch treaſure, as is here conteined in this gift? Doo not thou ſo, O my ſoule, doo not thou ſo; be not thou henceforth anie more blind; ſee thou ſeeke not anie carnall contentations, hauing meanes to be a partaker of this meere ſpirituall and celeſtiall delight.
                        Take no more taſte and pleaſure in the food of death (whereof thou earſt didſt feed) hauing this bread of life giuen and granted vnto thee. Regard not the pomps, and moſt vaine vanities of this world; ſeeing thou maieſt enioie in this Sacrament the true happineſſe, and good things, which in the world cannot poſſiblie be atteined. Imbrace and keepe this treaſure, which ſufficeth to make thee trulie happie; poſſeſſe this good, which exceedeth all good; content and quiet thy ſelfe in this repoſe, which may abundantlie ſatiate thy deſire: and be not ingratefull to this thy benefactor; but yeeld him hartie thanks, as well for this, as all other benefits heretofore, from the beginning beſtowed vpon thee.
                        Howbeit, my gratious and mercifull Lord, how can I yeeld thee woorthie thanks; the debt I owe thee being ſo great, and mine abilitie to diſcharge the ſame ſo ſmall? With all my hart, and with all my might, and power, I thanke thine infinite liberalitie, for hauing created me to thine owne likeneſſe and ſimilitude, and for hauing for my conſeruation created likewiſe ſo great varietie of other creatures: and much more doo I laud & bleſſe thee, for that with thy pretious death and bloud-ſhed thou haſt redeemed me: ye a O Lord & now I doo with all my bowels and powers of my body & ſoule thanke thee, bleſſe thee, & adore thee, for hauing left vs this he auenlie and moſt woorthie Sacrament; and for giuing me miſerable wretch, the grace eftſoons to receiue it, that eftſoones I may thereby be made partaker of the fruit of thy redemption.
                        
                           
And bicauſe theſe my thanks and praiſes be ſlender, weake, and vnwoorthie of ſuch gifts as I haue receiued: I beſeech thy ſweet ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, to ſupplie my want. Here vouchſafe to ſound perpetuall peales of praiſes for me; euerlaſtinglie to adore thee for mee: to reuerence thee for me, and to offer the continuall ſacrifice of thanks-giuing for me. And yet for that, all that I can doo is finite, & is not correſpondent to the value of the benefit I haue this daie receiued, being infinite. Thoſe moſt holie and gratefull thanks, which thou Lord Ieſu gaueſt to thy Father, minding to grant vs this ſo ineſtunable a gift, euen thoſe ſame, which are infinite, doo I offer both to him and thee together. For verelie beleeue I, that for this cauſe didſt thou yeeld them; that ſo incomparable a gift ſhould not be deſtitute of condigne graces, and thanks. And now doo I humblie beſeech thee, of thy moſt bonntifull clemencie, that ſeeing it hath pleaſed thee to ſatiate and honour me with thy moſt worthie preſence in this venerable and redoubted Sacrament; thou wilt alſo vouchſafe to grant me thy grace to be alwaies gratefull, and to anſwere woorthilie to this moſt happie viſitation.
                        This hath alwaies beene thy woont, my Sauiour and Redeemer; that where through thy goodnes thou haſt vouchſafed to enter, there haſt thou departed of thy bleſſings moſt abundantlie; heaping grace vpon grace; and mercie vpon mercie. Thou enteredſt into Matthew the Publicans houſe; and from a Publican thou madeſt him thy Diſciple, & an Apoſtle. Thou enteredſt into Zacheus houſe; when by and by he was changed from his old cuſtome: and health was giuen to all his houſhold. Thou enteredſt into Sunon Peters houſe, & draueſt awaie the ague from his wiues mother; leauing hir whole and comforted. Eft ſoones didſt thou enter into Martha & good Marie Magdalens

houſe; and what tongue can tell the ſpirituall riches thou gaueſt to that houſe; and the ineffable graces thou endowedſt thoſe two ſiſters with▪ Finallie, the figure of this Sacrament, to wit, the arke of the old Teſtament, becauſe it entred into Obed Edoms houſe, was cauſe that thy bleſſings were powred vpon him, and all his, paieng plentifullie for the harborough that in that houſe was offered thee.
                        Wherefore, O moſt ſweet and welcome gheſt, ſeeing through thy goodneſſe thou haſt vouchſafed this daie to enter into my poore cottage, ſend downe withall thy holie bleſſings thereon; by meanes whereof, I may woorthilie anſwer vnto this thine incomparable mercie. Cleanſe and fine this houſe, Lord, from all the filth thou ſeeſt in it. Repaire and doo ſome coſt on it, leaſt it decaie and fall to ruine; driue out the darkeneſſe in it, with the gliſtering beames of thy light; adorne and decke it vp with the vertues and graces of the holie Ghoſt; that being thus cleanſed, repaired, adorned, and illuminated, it may pleaſe thee to dwell therein, and neuer to depart. Tarrie ſtill with me, O Lord, my comforter; the night draweth nigh, & without thee ſhall I remaine in darkeneſſe, and ſo be ſore endangered. O therefore, I ſaie, tarrie thou ſtill with me, and depart not from this lodging. Thou haſt affirmed, O eternall truth, how thy whole delight is to dwell with the children of men, and how thou ſtandeſt knocking at the doore, ready to euter and ſup with ſuch as ſhall open, and let thee in. Behold how I haue giuen thee free entrance into me; and thou of thy goodneſſe haſt admitted me to the ſweet ſupper of thy moſt ſacred bodie. Abandon me not therfore my ſouereigne Lord, ne depart thou from me; drawe me after thee; knit and tie me faſt to thee; yea drawe me quite out of my ſelfe, ſith I am much better in thee, than in me. In thee I liue, in me I die; in thee I remaine firme and

conſtant, in me I decaie and come to naught.
                        Renew me therefore, O my ſanctifier, and through loue tranſforme me into thee, & grant me ſo to liue in thee, as that I onlie liue to thee, I onlie loue thee, I onlie delight in thee, that thou be mine onlie ioie, mine onlie comfort, mine onlie foode, wherewith my ſoule may in ſuch ſort be refreſhed, as that all other meats ſeeme loathſome and vnſauorie to it. This onlie haue I choſen, this onlie ſhall ſuffice me, with this alone will I liue contented, ſatiſfied, and happie; vntill the deſired daie come, when I ſhall feed of thee in another forme, and enioie thee continuallie in the companie of all the elect and bleſſed Saincts of the celeſtiall court, where with the Father and the holie Ghoſt, thou liueſt and reigneſt euerlaſtinglie,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another fruitfull meditation of the Chriſtian ſoule, exhorting to thankefulneſſe, newneſſe of life, and holie conuerſation; in deepe conſideration of the great benefits of Chriſt receiued in the Sacrament, to be read after the receiuing of the holie Communion in the Church (if time ſerue) or at home, eſpeciallie on Eaſter daie.
                        
                        
                           THat thou maiſt not doubt, O my ſoule, of ſo great wealth and felicitie, as is wrought for thee in theſe holie myſteries of Chriſt (whereof now thou haſt beene a partaker) by his glorious death and reſurrection; let vs a little refreſh our ſelues with the contemplation thereof, & as it were chaw the cud, by calling them often to our remembrance; that ſo taking great delite in the ſweet taſte thereof, we may the leſſe feele or perceiue the bitterneſſe

of this miſerable life. Go to therefore, O my ſoule, call to mind now, I ſaie; and wee that therefore thou haſt receiued into thine owne poſſeſſion, the euerlaſting veritie, euen our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, to confirme to thy conſcience the truth of all this matter.
                        Thou haſt receiued him, if in true faith & repentance of hart thou haſt receiued him; if in purpoſe of amendment of life thou haſt receiued him; for an euerlaſting gage and pledge of thy ſaluation. Thou haſt receiued his bodie, which was once broken; and his blood, which was once ſhed for the remiſſion of thy ſinnes: thou haſt receiued his bodie to haue within thee the Father, the Sonne, and the holie Ghoſt, for to dwell with thee, to indue thee with grace, to ſtrengthen thee againſt thine enimies, to helpe thy weakneſſe, to poſſeſſe thee with peace and gladneſſe, to make thee thankfull to thy redeemer, and carefull to lead a godlie conuerſation, and to comfort thee with their preſence in weale and wo: thou haſt receiued his bodie, I ſaie, to indue thee with euerlaſting righteouſneſſe, to aſſure thee of perpetuall bliſſe, and life eternall. For with Chriſt, by true faith, art thou, my ſoule quickened againe from death of ſin, to life of grace; and in hope tranſlated from corporall and euerlaſting death, to the euerlaſting life of glorie in heauen; where now from hencefoorth thy conuerſation indeed ſhould be, and thy hart and deſire alwaie fixed and ſet.
                        Doubt not therfore, O my ſoule, of the truth of this matter; how great and high ſo euer theſe myſteries and things be. For it becommeth thy God to doo no little deeds; how impoſſible ſo euer they ſeeme to thee. But praie to God hartilie, that thou maiſt haue faith to perceiue theſe great myſteries; that by faith thou maiſt certeinlie knowe and beleeue nothing to be impoſſible with God. Onelie bring thou faith, I ſaie, to

Chriſts holie word and Sacraments, and thou ſhalt well feele and perceiue the benefits of Chriſt conteined therein to thy comfort. Let thy repentance ſhew thy faith alſo; let thy purpoſe of amendement and obedience of thy hart to Gods lawe hereafter declare thy true beleefe. And now endeuour thy ſelfe, O my ſoule, to ſaie with S. Paule: From hencefoorth my conuerſation is in heauen; from whence I looke for a Sauiour, euen the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, which ſhall change our vile bodies, that they may be made and faſhioned like to his glorious bodie; which he ſhall doo by the ſame power, whereby he roſe againe from death, and wherby he ſhall be able to ſubdue all things vnto himſelfe.
                        For elſe, what ſhall it auaile thee, O my ſoule, to bee eſcaped, and deliuered from the filthineſſe of the world, through the knowledge of thy Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, if thou be intangled againe therewith, and be thereby ouercome againe? Certeinlie, it had beene better neuer to haue knowne the waie of righteouſneſſe, than after it is knowne and receiued, to turne back-ward againe from the holie and moſt righteous commandements of God giuen vnto thee: ſo ſhall the prouerbe be verified of thee, where it is ſaid; The dog is returned to his vomit againe, and the ſow that was waſhed, to hir wallowing in the mire againe. Oh what a ſhame were it for thee, O my ſoule, being thus ſo cleerelie and freelie waſhed from thy ſinnes, to returne to the filthineſſe thereof againe? What a great follie were it, thus indued with righteouſneſſe, to looſe it againe? Yea, what wilfull madneſſe were it, to looſe the inheritance that thou art now ſet in, for the vile and tranſitorie pleaſures of ſinne? Finallie, what vnnaturall vnkindneſſe ſhould it be, where thy Sauiour Chriſt of his meere mercie is come to thee, to dwell within thee as thy gheſt; to driue him from thee, and

to baniſh him violentlie out of thee; and in ſtead of him in whome is all grace and vertue, to receiue the vngratious ſpirit of the diuell, the founder of all vnrighteouſneſſe, naughtineſſe and miſchiefe? Oh my ſoule, how canſt thou find in thy hart, I ſaie, to ſhew ſuch extreame vnkindnes to Chriſt Ieſus, which hath now ſo gentlie called thee to mercie, offered and giuen himſelfe vnto thee, and is now entred into thee? Yea, how dareſt thou be ſo bold, to renounce the preſence of the Father, the Sonne, and the holie Ghoſt, (for where one is, there God all whole in Maieſtie together with all his power, wiſedome, and goodneſſe is,) and feareſt thou not the danger and perill of ſo traiterous a defiance and departure?
                        O my ſoule, aduiſe thy ſelfe well what thou dooeſt, conſider the dignitie thou art now ſet in, and how thou art therfore cleanſed, waſhed, ſanctified, and renewed, that thou ſhouldeſt from hencefoorth ſinne no more; but ſerue God in true holineſſe and righteouſneſſe all the daies of thy life, that in the end thou maiſt reigne with him in euerlaſting life. If thou refuſe ſo great grace whereto thou art called, what other thing dooeſt thou, than heape vp thy damnation more and more, and ſo prouoke God to caſt his heauie diſpleaſure vpon thee, and by his iuſt plagues to reuenge this thy mockage of his holie Sacraments, in ſo great abuſing of them? Be verie warie and well aduiſed therefore I ſaie, O my ſoule, how from hencefoorth thou dooeſt behaue thy ſelfe; and let not follie looſe that thing, which grace hath ſo pretiouſlie offered and purchaſed. Let not wilfulneſſe and blindneſſe put out ſo great light as is ſhewed vnto thee, but applie thy ſelfe to liue in Chriſt, that Chriſt may ſtill liue in thee, whoſe fauour and aſſiſtance if thou haue, then haſt thou euerlaſting life alreadie within thee, then can nothing hurt thee: whatſoeuer is hitherto done amiſſe and committed,

Chriſt (thou ſeeſt) hath offered thee pardon, and cleerelie receiued thee into his fauour againe; in full ſuretie whereof, thou haſt him now preſentlie inhabiting and dwelling within thee. Onlie take good hart vnto thee, ſhew thy ſelfe thankefull in thy life, and determine with thy ſelfe to refuſe, auoid, deteſt and abhorre all ſuch things in thy conuerſation, as ſhould offend the eies of his mercie. Endeuour thy ſelfe now, I ſaie, O my ſoule, that waie to riſe vp againe, which waie thou haſt fallen into the pit or ſinke of ſin; as if by thy tong thou haſt offended, now thereby riſe againe, and glorifie God therewithall; accuſtome it to laud and praiſe the name of God, as thou haſt therewith diſhonoured it. And as thou haſt hurt the good name of thy neighbour, or otherwiſe hindered him; ſo now intend to reſtore it to him againe: for without reſtitution, God accepteth not thy confeſſion, nor yet thy repentance. It is not ynough to forſake euill, except thou ſet thy courage to doo good. By what occaſion ſoeuer therfore thou haſt offended, I ſaie turne now the occaſion vnto the honouring of God, and profiting of thy neighbour.
                        True it is, O my ſoule, that ſin is ſtrong, and affections vnrulie; yea and hard it is to ſubdue and reſiſt thy nature ſo corrupt and leauened with the ſowre bitterneſſe of the poiſon, which thou receiuedſt by thé inheritance of thine old father Adam, but yet neuertheleſſe, be of good cheere, for Chriſt thy Sauiour hath ouercome the world, and all other enimies for thee. Sin ſhall not haue power ouer thee, for thou art now vnder grace: though thy power be weake, yet Chriſt is riſen againe to ſtrengthen thee in the battell; his holie ſpirit ſhall helpe thine infirmities. In full truſt therefore of this confidence, O my ſoule, take a good hart vnto thee; I ſaie, be of a good courage in the Lord, and put vpon thee all the holie armour of God, that thou maiſt ſtand faſt againſt the enimies, which would againe aſſault

and ſubdue thee, and bring thee againe into their thraldome, ſlauerie, and bondage.
                        Remember now O my ſoule, that thou art brought from thy vaine conuerſation, and that thy freedome is purchaſed neither with gold nor ſiluer, but with the deere price of the moſt pretious hart bloud of that innocent and immaculate lambe Ieſus Chriſt. And euen now at the leaſt O my ſoule, begin and take in hand in the name and feare of God, to purge the old leauen of ſinne and wickedneſſe, that corrupteth and ſowreth the ſweetneſſe of thy life, before the maieſtie of God, that thou maiſt be as new and freſh dough, void of all ſowre leauen of wickedneſſe; ſo ſhalt thou ſhew thy ſelfe to be ſweet bread to God, that he may haue his delight in thee; ſo ſhalt thou declare thy ſelfe a worthie hoſt for ſuch a gheſt, and that Chriſtes gifts and graces haue their effect in thee, and that thou haſt the right beleefe and knowledge of his holie myſteries now receiued of thee: finallie, ſo ſhalt thou, in applieng thy faith to the vertue of this holie Sacrament, and in thy life and conuerſation conforming and faſhioning thy ſelfe to the example and ſignification meant thereby, be moſt certaine and ſure to liue in this life happilie, & in the world to come to dwell with Chriſt (whome thou haſt now receiued) in euerlaſting glorie, which God for his mercies ſake, and for the deere and pretious merits of his onelie Sonne our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſts ſake grant vnto vs,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        The Praier.
                        
                           SO great and manifold are thy benefits O moſt good and mercifull God, towards mankind, as all people in euerie place ought greatlie to laud, woorthilie to praiſe, and highlie to extoll & magnifie thy bleſſed name. For what thing can be more pleaſant to men,

than that thou dooeſt eaſilie heare them at what time they call vpon thee, for ſuch things as they ſtand in need of? In what other good things ought we more to reioice of, than this, for that thou yeeldeſt thy ſelfe appeaſed and fauourable to our iniquities? Or why bee we not right happie and bleſſed, whome thou diddeſt vouchſafe to annexe vnto thy ſelfe in thy ſacred congregation, in feeding our hungrie ſtomachs with ſpirituall good things, and heauenlie deinties, and refreſhing vs continuallie with the moſt exquiſite and well furniſhed banket of thy bleſſed Sacraments, making vs to eate aboundantlie of thy heauenlie Manna and food of Angels, and to drinke plentiouſlie of the full cup of thy holie ſpirit and diuine grace, to our endleſſe comfort and conſolation in thee?
                        Oh Lord, thou dealeſt fauourablie euen with all other creatures alſo for thine elects ſake. Thou ſtabliſheſt the mountaines; ſtilleſt the raging of the ſea; appeaſeſt the madneſſe of the people, and dooeſt refreſh and lighten with great ioie the vttermoſt parts of the earth, through the brightneſſe of the heauenlie fires. Thou ſendeſt ſeaſonable weather, and timelie ſhowers, whereby onlie commeth fertilitie of the feelds, woonderfullie garniſhed with all kinde of fruites, whereby both men and beaſts haue aboundantlie wherewith to feed. Grant thou therefore thus much alſo vnto vs (who art the author of ſo manie good things) that we may alwaie be mindfull thereof, to render moſt condigne thanks vnto thee, and that an alteration of our old leauen being now made through the vertue of this bleſſed Sacrament, which we haue receiued, we may like the eagle from time to time, renew our youth in godlines of life, and vſe to our health and comfort thoſe things, which thou ſo louinglie beſtoweſt vpon vs, thorough Ieſus Chriſt our Lord,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        
                        At the ſolemnization of Matrimonie, praie thus:
                        
                        
                           ALmightie God, and moſt mercifull father, who haſt ordeined marriage to be kept without blame or breach to the end, not ſuffering that anie ſhould put aſunder thoſe, whome thou haſt ioined together. Sanctifie thoſe, which are called to this eſtate of life, to keepe it according to thy holie inſtitution and ordinance. And furthermore, as thou requireſt that we ſhould loue thee aboue all things, eſteeming more thy fauour, than either the riches or honour of this world, or life it ſelfe: ſo we beſeech thee, O Lord, to teach vs how to vſe theſe tranſitorie things, that we abuſe them not in ſetting our harts vpon them, or delighting more in them than is meete; but that we may ſo loue our huſbands, children, houſe & lands, and our owne liues, or whatſoeuer thou giueſt vs for our comfort heere for a time, that we may keepe ſtill the higheſt degree of our loue for thee our ſpirituall huſband; ſo that where the queſtion ſhall be betweene thee and anie thing elſe, we may make loſſe of all things, to abide perfectlie in our loue towards thee to the end; to whome, with the father, and the holie ghoſt, be all laud and praiſe for euer and euer,
                        Amen.
                        Or as at the ſolemnization of Matrimonie in the fift Lampe.
                     
                     
                        At the buriall of anie, meditate and praie, as followeth:
                        
                           O Lord Ieſu Chriſt Sonne of God, which art the giuer of eternall life; we hartilie thanke thee, becauſe thou art inwardlie touched with mercie towards vs, oppreſſed both with temporall and euerlaſting

miſeries: thou haſt taſted death, and with thy fleſh thou haſt touched the graue, and earth, wherby it is ſanctified and made light to the godlie, ſo that it can not keepe them in etternall death. According to thy commandement, there ſtand the bringers and miniſters of death, euen ſinne and Satan: but thou pluckeſt the faithfull out of the iawes of death; bringeſt them to a new life; through the comfort of thy Goſpell teacheſt them to ſpeake, and ſound foorth thy glorie; cōmendeſt them in this life to the mother the Church, and at length, death and all euils being ſubdued, thou wilt bring them into thy kingdome.
                        Wee humblie beſeech thee, take mercie vpon thy Church in theſe miſerable daies. For ſhe is as a widowe deſtitute of all worldlie helpe, and dependeth onlie vpon thy mercifull aid and protection. Speake vnto hir with cheerfull voice, and ſaie; Weepe not: powre vpon thine, the true light of faith and comfort; lift vs vp in the mids of death with a confidence of thy preſence, and hope of eternall life. Driue awaie the gard of death; teach vs to ſet foorth thy truth, and at the length, let vs be placed with the ſweet mother of all Saints, in the true countrie of that happie citie Ieruſalem, where we ſhall for euermore enioie the bleſſed ſight both of thee, and thy heauenlie congregation,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another deuout praier at burials.
                        
                           LORD, thou art God for euer; ſhort is our life; alwaies ſome of vs die; & other ſome come into the world: and with thee a thouſand yeeres bee but one daie, yea as the leaſt minute of an houre. This life paſſeth awaie as dooth a dreame, euen as graſſe in the field; greene to daie,

and drie to morowe. If thou be diſpleaſed, then we be loſt; if thou chaſten, then ſhrinke we for feare. For thorough ſinnes we be dead vnto thee. Certes Lord, if thou haue reſpect to our ſinnes, who ſhall continue? Shew vs how manie be the daies of our life, that we may diſpend them wiſelie to the praiſe of thy name; leaſt that we falſelie, truſting vpon long life, might come vnto death. Oh good God, how fraile and corrupt a worke be we indeed:? Euen but verie duſt and aſhes; and the length of our daies be as the flower in the field. No man can deliuer himſelfe from death; no man can ſaue his owne ſoule from the graue: thou onelie, O Lord, muſt doo it; namelie, to ſuch as beleeue in thee. O my GOD, haue mercie vpon me, and take mee not awaie vnprouided, in the middeſt of my daies; but let me go to my graue in a full age. Let me remember mine end, that when I ſhall depart out of this life, I be not depriued of euerlaſting life. Let me beare alwaies before mine eies, the ſhortneſſe of this life; and what a vanitie, and what a thing of naught it is; as well the men themſelues, as all their things and affaires.
                        Staie my feete, O Lord, that at no time they ſlip with ſome cruell zeale or enuie, that I might haue at the vngodlie, which for the moſt part paſſe their liues quietlie, and die more quietlie. I beſeech thee, let not thy choſen perſons be diſcouraged, nor offended, by this thy godlie prouidence, in ordering of worldlie things; nor ſhrinke from thee by reaſon thereof: but rather let vs remember in what dangers in verie deed theſe vngodlie be in; and with how vnhappie a concluſion and terme they cloſe & finiſh their happie courſe. And againe on the contrarie part, what pleaſantneſſe of conſcience; and what comfort and quietneſſe ſhall followe this our vnquietneſſe. Finallie, O good God, in the daie of my buriall, when all my friends ſhrinke

from me, doo not thou forſake me: when my father and mother, huſband and children forſake me, vouchſafe thou, O Lord, to take me vp, and defend me from the roring lions, that wait for their praie; & lead mee ſafelie through the vnknown countrie, & bring me happilie to the ſtreets of the heauenlie Zion, wherein is the habitation of all that reioice in thee; and there ſet mee amongſt thine Angels, before the face of thine owne Maieſtie; where with the Patriarchs, Prophets, Apoſtles, Martyrs, Confeſſors, Uirgins; yea and with all my deere parents and faithfull friends, in full meaſure of happineſſe, paſſing excellent glorie, and ſuperabundant ioie of thanks-giuing and praiſe, I may magnifie thee, my God, among thy choſen holie ones, for euer and euer,
                        Amen.
                        Sée another praier in the Ladie Aburgauennies praiers.
                     
                     
                        Another meditation of death.
                        
                           O GOD, what other thing doo wee daily in this preſent life than heape ſinne vpon ſinne, and hourd treſpas vpon treſpas? So that this daie is woorſe alwaies than yeſterdaie; by increaſing as daies, ſo ſins; and therefore thine indignation, good Lord, againſt vs: but when we ſhall be let go out of the priſon of this bodie, and ſo taken into thy bleſſed companie; then ſhall we be in moſt ſafetie of immortalitie and ſaluation; then ſhall come vnto vs no ſickneſſe, no need, no paine, no kind of euill to ſoule or bodie: but whatſoeuer good we can wiſh, that ſhall we haue; and whatſoeuer we loath, ſhall be farre from vs. Oh deere Father, that we had faith to behold theſe things accordinglie! Oh that our harts were perſuaded thereof, and our affections inflamed

with the deſire of them! Then ſhould we liue in longing, for that which now we moſt loath. Oh helpe vs, and grant that we being ignorant of things to come, and of the time of our death, which to thee is certaine, may ſo liue and finiſh our iournie here, that we may be readie; and then depart, when our departing may make moſt to thy glorie, and our comfort, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another ſweet meditation, of the longing of the ſoule to be with God; out of Saint Auguſtine.
                        
                           O Kingdome of all worlds eternall, wherein is ioie ſurmounting all ioies; and the peace of God, which paſſeth all vnderſtanding: wherein alſo the ſoules of all holie folke doo reſt and reigne with thee, O Lord, in euerlaſting ioie, mirth and gladneſſe. When ſhall I enter into thee, that I may ſee my God, which dwelleth in thee? When ſhall I go thither, & behold this great ſight? What is it that holds me backe? Wo is me, that my ſoiourning is prolonged: wo is me; how long ſhall it be ſaid vnto me; Wait, and wait againe? And now to what purpoſe is my waiting? My Lord God, doo we not wait and watch for the Sauiour, our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, to come and repaire our baſe bodies vnto the likeneſſe of his glorious bodie? We wait and watch, like wiſe virgins, with our loines girt, and our lamps burning, for the Lord our Bridegroome, when he ſhould come from the Bridehouſe, to fetch vs into his wedding. Come Lord Ieſus, and tarie not: come Lord Ieſu Chriſt; come viſit vs in peace: come lead vs priſoners out of priſon, that we may reioice before thee with a perfect hart: come our Sauiour, thou that art

longed for, of all nations and people; come ſhew thy countenance vnto vs, and we ſhall be ſafe: come my light, and my redeemer, my GOD, and my ſpouſe, take my ſoule out of priſon, that it may giue praiſe vnto thy name.
                        How long ſhall I be toſſed in the waues of my mortalitie, crieng vnto thee Lord, and thou heareſt me not? Lord heare me how I crie vnto thee out of this huge ſea, and bring me to the hauen of endleſſe bliſſe. Happie are they, O God, which are conueied out of this ſea, and haue obteined to arriue at thee, the ſafeſt harborough of all hauens. O happie are they indeed, which are eſcaped alreadie from ſea to ſhore; from baniſhment home into their owne countrie; and from priſon into a palace; enioieng their wiſhed reſt! Bleſſed are they that alreadie haue gained the garland of endleſſe glorie, which they ſought for here by manie tribulations; and ioie now in happie mirth for euer. O bleſſed are they indeed! O treble, and foure-times bleſſed are they, which being alreadie quite rid of all miſeries, haue atteined to the kingdome of beautifulneſſe, and euerlaſting bliſſefulneſſe, and are aſſured of their vnappearable glorie! For there is ioie endleſſe; mirth ſorowleſſe; health griefeleſſe; waie without labour; light without darkneſſe; life without death. Happie therefore, I ſaie, are thoſe, that alreadie haue eſcaped the ſhipwracke of this preſent miſerable life, and obteined the grace to come to ſo great ioies in heauen. But alas, we are yet ſtill in the waues of the ſea, longing for thee, O Lord, the hauen of our ſea. O Ieruſalem the heauenlie countrie of ours! O quiet countrie! we looke towards thee, and ken thee a farre off. Wee hale thee from this ſea; we ſigh vnto thee out of this vale of miſerie, and labour with teares, if we may by anie meanes attaine vnto thee. O Chriſt, God, and the onlie hope of all mankind; our refuge and ſtrength,

whoſe brightneſſe inlighteneth our eies a farre off, as the beames of the ſea-ſtarre dooth in the miſtie darkneſſe of the ſtormie ſea, to guide vs vnto thee our hauen. Lord, gouerne our ſhip with thy right hand, by the helme of thy croſſe, that wee periſh not in the waues; that the tempeſt of the water drowne vs not, and that the deepe ſwalowe vs not vp: but with the hooke of thy croſſe, plucke vs backe out of this vaſt ſea, vnto thee our onlie comfort, whom we ſee waiting for vs a farre off, as the morning-ſtarre, and as the daieſunne of righteouſneſſe, in maner with weeping eies, vpon the ſhore of the heauenlie countrie. Behold we, whom thou haſt ranſomed, doo crie vnto thee, yea euen we, as yet thy baniſhed exiles, whom thou haſt redeemed with thy pretious bloud, doo crie vnto thee: heare vs, O God our Sauiour, the hope of all the ends of the earth, and of all them that be in the ſea a farre off. We be conuerſant in a troubleſome ſea, and thou ſtanding vpon the ſhore, lookeſt at our perils. Oh ſaue vs for thy name ſake, that we periſh not. And Lord, grant vs ſo to keepe our courſe betweene Scylla and Charybdis, and to hold ſo with thee, that we may eſcape the dangers of both, and come ſafe to land without loſſe of ſhip, or fraight,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another meditation of the happineſſe of the good ſoule hence departing: at burials.
                        
                        
                           HAppie is the ſoule, which departing from the earthly bodie goeth directlie into heauen: ſecure it is and quiet, and feareth neither enimie nor death. For it enioieth continuallie thy preſence, O God, & vnceſſantlie beholdeth the moſt glorious Lord, whome ſhe hath ſerued and loued, and whom now at the length full ioifullie and gloriouſlie

ſhe hath attained vnto.
                        And this glorie of ſo great bleſſedneſſe, neither time ſhall diminiſh, nor anie wicked perſon take awaie. The daughters of Zion haue ſeene hir, and counted hir bleſſed; euen the Queenes and the concubines haue praiſed hir, ſaieng: Who is ſhe that commeth vp out of the deſert, abounding in pleaſure, leaning vpon hir welbeloued? Who is ſhe that looketh foorth as the morning; faire as the Moone; pure as the Sunne; terrible as an armie with banners? How cheerefullie goeth ſhe out, haſtneth, runneth, when all amazed ſhee heareth hir beloued ſaieng vnto hir on this wiſe: Ariſe my loue, my faire one, and come awaie. For behold, the winter now is paſt, the raine is changed and gone awaie, the flouds appeere in our earth, the time of the ſinging of the bird is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land. The fig-tree hath brought foorth hir yong figs, and the vines with their ſmall grapes haue caſt a ſauour. Ariſe my loue, my faire one, and come awaie; my doue that art in the holes of the rocke, in the ſecret places of the ſtaires, ſhew me thy ſight; let me heare thy voice, for thy voice is ſweet, and thy ſight comelie. Come awaie my choſen, my faire one, my doue, mine vnſpotted one, my ſpouſe, come awaie, and I will put thee into my bed-chamber, becauſe I haue longed after thy beautie. Come awaie, that thou maiſt triumph in my preſence with mine Angels, whoſe companie I haue promiſed thee. After manie perils and labour come awaie, enter into thy maiſters ioie, the which no man ſhall take from thee,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another which may be vſed on all Saincts daie.
                        
                           OH happie are all thy Saincts, O Chriſt, which haue paſſed ouer the ſea of this mortalitie, and attained vnto the hauen of perpetuall quietneſſe, ſecuritie and peace, where

they are at reſt, and alwaie ioifull and merrie! Wherfore of thy tender loue I beſeech thee, O Chriſt, who art without care of thy ſelfe, be carefull for vs; who needeſt not to care for incorruptible glorie, haue thou a conſideration of our manifold miſeries. O our God, who haſt choſen a people to thy ſelfe, and endued them with glorie, making them both immortall of thine immortalitie, and ioifull through thy bleſſed ſight; I beſeech thee be thou alwaies mindfull of vs, and helpe vs, who as yet in the ſalt ſeas of this life are toſſed with the ſurges about vs. O thou goodlie gate, who art raiſed into a maruellous highneſſe, helpe vs vile pauement, lieng much beneath thee; giue vs thine hand, and raiſe vp ſuch as lie vpon the ground, that waxing ſtrong out of weakeneſſe, we may be made couragious in battell. Make thou interceſſion for vs continuallie, and vnceſſantlie praie for vs wretches, and moſt negligent ſinners, that through thy praiers we may be conioined to the holie companie of ſaincts, for otherwiſe we ſhall neuer be ſaued. For alas, we are verie fraile, weakelings of no courage, creatures giuen to the ſeruice of the bellie and fleſh, hauing in vs almoſt no ſparkle of vertue, and yet placed vnder thy confeſſion. O Chriſt, we are borne by the wood of the croſſe through this great and wide ſea, where are things creeping innumerable, both ſmall beaſts and great; wherein the moſt cruell dragon is, alwaie prepared to deuour vs, wherein be the dangerous rocks, Scylla and Charybdis with other ſuch like innumerable things, whereby the heedleſſe and wauering in faith make ſhipwracke. Wherefore O Chriſt praie for vs, O good Chriſt praie thou (we ſaie) for vs; that through thy good praiers and merits, we may deſerue, ſhip and merchandiſe being ſaued, to attaine vnto the port of perpetuall ſaluation, quietneſſe, peace and ſecuritie, which neuer ſhall haue end,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        
                        After the ſeruice and common praier ended, praie thus:
                        
                        
                           O Ieſu Chriſt, the verie true Aaron, and onlie high Biſhop of our ſoule, which in thine own name art gone vp into the moſt holie place, and beareſt our names before the Lord vpon thy ſhoulders for a continuall remembrance. Forſomuch as our offerings and ſacrifice cannot be ſo perfect, but that through our frailtie ſome fault and imperfection ſhall be found therein in thy ſight; vouchſafe we beſeech thee, O holieſt of all holies, and our moſt perfect high prieſt, in mercie to beare the iniquities of our publike praiers, and common ſacrifice, which we thy people with one accord, by thy grace, haue heere at this time made, and offered vnto God the Father, in thy name. Pardon, O pardon our dulneſſe and coldneſſe in deuotion; and let this our oblation be alwaies vpon thy forehead, to cauſe theſe our burnt offerings to be preſented and accepted, for a ſweet ſauour of reſt before the Lord our God; that through thy onelie mediation, he being pacified, our ſinnes pardoned, and we gratiouſlie reconciled and ſanctified, may be woorthie often to haue acceſſe to thy mercie-ſeate, to woorſhip thee in thy holie Temple; and now as thy ſeruants, to go in peace, to glorifie thee in all holie obedience to thy word, & to doo vnto the poore as much as we can, So be it.
                        
                     
                     
                        Or elſe thus.
                        
                           ALmightie God, which haſt giuen vs grace at this time with one accord to make our common ſupplications vnto thee: and dooeſt promiſe, that when two or three be gathered togither

in thy name, thou wilt grant their requeſt; fulfill now O Lord the deſires and petitions of thy ſeruants, as may be moſt expedient for them; granting vs in this world knowledge of thy truth, and in the world to come, life euerlaſting,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        When the people ariſe to depart out of the Church, ſaie thus to thy ſelfe.
                        
                        
                           RIſe vp, O Lord, ariſe, and let thine enimies be ſcattered; yea, let all them that hate thee, and prophane thine honour, flee before thee: but gather the Saincts togither continuallie, and let them neuer depart from thy Church, So be it.
                        
                     
                     
                        So ſoone as you be out of the Church dore ſaie:
                        
                        BLeſſed bee the glorie of the LORD out of his place.
                     
                     
                        Going homeward from the Church, meditate and praie as followeth.
                        
                        
                           O Chriſt, whoſe home is heauen, and whoſe houſe is a place of ioies eternall; I thanke thee for all thy great mercies ſhewed towards me, eſpeciallie for vouchſafing mee yet time to repent and liue godlie: grant alſo I beſeech thee, that being trulie humbled before thee this daie, I may by my good life declare, that I haue not come to Church in vaine; and that with the penitent Publicane, I may returne home now to my houſe vnder thy protection, imbettered and iuſtified both before God and man, and in all holie obedience glorifie thee both at home and abroade, in my life and in my death,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        
                        Another.
                        
                           BEhold me, O Lord, I praie thee, a poore ſeelie woorme here creeping & walking bodilie on earth for a time in this life, (which is our pilgrimage and paſſage to our home) and make me more mindfull of mine euerlaſting home, and very deſirous to returne to the houſe of the liuing: that hauing mine affections inflamed by thy holie ſpirit, I may vtterlie contemne all earthlie things, and couet euermore to be preſent with thee: that my conuerſatoin may be in heauen, whither grant mee at the length to come, there in my long home with thy children to be partaker of thy glorie, and to reioice as thy child, bicauſe of this my euerlaſting home, and the great glorie thereof.
                        For I knowe, O Lord, that if mine earthlie houſe of this tabernacle (my bodie) were deſtroied, I haue a building of thee, euen an habitation not made with hands, but eternall in heauen; for the which I ſigh, deſiring to be further clothed with my houſe, which is from heauen, that mortalitie might be ſwalowed vp of life; bicauſe I knowe, that as long as I am at home in the bodie, I am abſent from thee; therefore had I rather to be abſent from the bodie, and to be preſent with thee, O Lord: neuertheleſſe, whether I be at home, or from home, I am of good comfort, and alwaies of good cheere in thee: beſeeching thee in mercie to grant me grace, to endeuour my ſelfe ſo to walke by faith in thy feare, after the inward appearance, that when we ſhall all appeare before the iudgement-ſeate of Chriſt, euerie one to receiue the works of his bodie, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad, I may be found accepted vnto thee,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        
                        When you enter into your houſe, praie.
                        
                           THY fauour and grace, O God, being my guide, I enter into this my materiall houſe and home: beſeeching thy mercie ſo to bleſſe and preſerue my comming in, and my going out, both now and euer; that thy peace, O God, which paſſeth all vnderſtanding, may be euermore therin, and that I neuer turne back, or be deformedlie ſcattered abroad from thee, vntill thou bring me home from this painfull pilgrimage, whereas be the firſt fruits of my ſpirit: So be it.
                        
                     
                     
                        Being come home, praie.
                        
                           LORD bleſſe vs, and make our houſes, Churches of thy ſaints, linked in one confeſſion and religion, that being by thee made all of one mind in this houſe, we may with the deuout Galileans praiſe thee for thy benefits both now and euer.
                        O Lord, now faſhion & conforme me by thy holie ſpirit in this houſe of my peregrination; that herein, enioieng the benefit of perfect peace, moſt ſeemelie quietneſſe, and comlie order, I may make thy myſteries my ſongs, vntill it ſhall pleaſe thee to lead me vpward, vnto the peace of thy children; euen into thy holie houſe, and manſion place, where thou haſt placed vs; and where we ſhall will or deſire nothing elſe; but to tarrie and remaine for euer. For whileſt we are clad with this bodie, we doo as it were go aſtraie, and are ſtrangers vnto thee, neither haue we here anie abiding place for euer; but we muſt ſeeke for one that is to come. To the which thou bring vs,

that cameſt from thence to redeeme vs, Ieſus Chriſt the righteous; to whom with the Father and the holie Ghoſt, be all poſſible praiſe, and endleſſe glorie, now and for euer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Praiers before meate on Sundaie.
                        
                           ALmightie God, and moſt mercifull Father, who haſt taught vs that outward things defile not a man; but thoſe that proceede from the hart: grant vs ſo to eſteeme cleane, that thou pronounceſt cleane, as that by praier and thankes-giuing, the vſe of thy creatures made for our benefit, may be ſanctified vnto vs: and of the other part, ſo to abhorre the polluſion of ſinne, which onelie thou declareſt to be common and vncleane, that wee may auoid by thy grace all murders, adultries, thefts, falſe-witneſſe-bearing, vnlawfull deſires, and concupiſcence, and whatſoeuer thou haſt forbidden touching our dutie towards men, or ſeruice and obedience vnto thee: that being thus ſanctified by thy grace, we may alwaies haue free acceſſe vnto thy ſanctuarie, in this life; and be receiued into the heauenlie Ieruſalem, where no Canaanite, nor vncleane perſon ſhall enter in the life to come, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord: to whom with thee, and the holie Ghoſt, be all honour, glorie, and praiſe, for euer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another.
                        
                           O Sonne of God, which by thy miraculous multiplieng of a few fiſhes and loaues of bread, didſt feed fiue thouſand of thy people in the wilderneſſe, both inwardlie with ſpirituall comfort, and outwardlie with corporall food, thereby

ſhewing thy ſelfe in deed to be the Creator & ſuſteiner of all things: we beſeech thee, who onelie giueſt vs the breath of life, and knoweſt what we need, and alone canſt giue a reaſon, why after this maner thou wilt feed vs with corporall things; and not as thou dooeſt the ſtartes without anie nouriſhment. Giue vnto thy Church, of thy wiſedome, ſuch things as are neceſſarie for the ſuſtentation of this life, wherein the ioies of the life eternall and to come doo begin. And albeit ſomtime we lacke diuers things, although thine aduerſarie throweth ſtones at vs for bread, yet by thy power ſtrengthen vs that we faint not. And that we which liue not by bread alone, or by our owne induſtrie; being armed with thy word and promiſe, (the ſpirituall food and ſword of our ſoule) may receiue comfort thereby, and being protected by thee after a woonderfull ſort, to liue and glorifie thee both here, and in the world to come,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another praier before meat, to be vſed that daie that you haue receiued the holie Communion.
                        
                        
                           WE thanke thee, O eternall houſholder, for that after the banket of paradiſe troubled by the diuell & man, thou haſt againe of thine infinite goodneſſe, through thy ſonne, prepared a ſumptuous ſupper, and great feaſt. And for as much as thy people, among whom the tower of thy daily iunkets was placed, togither with the moſt part of the world, do deſpiſe thy holie table, and ſuffer themſelues to be caried about vnto the bankets of Satan, and vaine pleaſures of this world. Thou haſt vouchſafed to call vs, moſt vnwoorthie wretches, being lame, blind, and beggerlie in this laſt age of the world, that the number of thine elect may be filled: yea, thou compelleſt

ſome, lieng in the high waies, and about hedges, by reaſon of the troubles and decaie of kingdoms, through the preaching of thy word, to come to the participation of thy banket. We humblie beſeech thee bring vs to thine heauenlie table; appoint vs a place therein euermore. Grant that from thy ſonne, which is the bread and liuelie wine, we may drawe nouriſhment and iuice; that the drineſſe of our nature may be watered, and we at length taſte of thy ſupper in the table of euerlaſting life, and drinke the new wine of thy ſonne, enioieng his viſible ſight in the bleſſed ſocietie of all thine elect,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        When you begin to eate, immediatelie bleſſe, and ſaie:
                        
                        
                           LORD God, which art the ſanctifier of thy Saints, and the euerlaſting ſuffiſance that ſhalt be giuen to the hungrie: bleſſe thou from heauen theſe thy good creatures and great benefits, (which thou haſt created to releeue the want of thy hungrie children, and to be receiued with thanks-giuing) with thy celeſtiall benediction: that they may be as a healthfull medicine or remedie to our humane nature. And grant that by the inuocation of thy holie name, we now ſoberlie taking, and temperatelie and thankfullie taſting hereof, may therewithall receiue both helth of bodie, and ſafegard of ſoule, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Or elſe praie thus for the ſober vſing of your meate and drinke.
                        
                        
                           GRant, O moſt mercifull God, that ſo long as we wander in this wretched world, we may ſo take our meate and drinke, for the infirmitie of our fleſh, that we neuer be corrupted

by fine fare, (wherein the fleſh delighteth) neither yet by anie fooliſh ſuperſtition; nor that we be drawne awaie at anie time from temperance and ſobrietie: but let vs alwaies remember ſo to vſe our abundance, that when we abound in all things moſt plentifullie, we may giue our ſelues to moderate abſtinence continuallie; as alſo that we may patientlie beare all pouertie and hunger when it commeth: and that wee may ſo vſe libertie in our meates and drinks, that alwaies the glorie of thy name, O Lord, may be before our eies; and that ſuch frugalitie may appeare in all our life, that we may continuallie ſeeke that ſatietie and fulneſſe, whereby we ſhall be ſatiate for euer moſt abundantlie, when the glorie of thy countenance ſhall appeere vnto vs in the heauens, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        When you take ſalt, meditate a little to your ſelfe, and ſaie:
                        
                        
                           EUerie man ſhall be ſalted with fire, and euerie ſacrifice ſhall be ſeaſoned with ſalt. Salt is good; but if the ſalt be vnſauourie, wherewith ſhall it be ſeaſoned? O God, giue vs grace to haue ſalt in our ſelues, and to haue peace one with another; & let all our communication now be ſo well ſauoured and powdered with ſalt; that is to ſaie, ſeaſoned with godlie wiſedome, that we knowing how and when to ſpeake, all our talke may tend to the glorie of thy name, and the edifieng of our owne ſoules, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        In the meale time.
                        
                           LET one of your children or ſeruants, that beſt can, reade this caution following; and after that, ſome chapter or portion of the Scripture

diſtinctlie and reuerentlie, that all at the boord may giue diligent eare therevnto.
                     
                     
                        The cautions or remembrances to be ſaid of the child in the meate time.
                        
                        
                           REmember that theſe meates and drinkes heere ſet before you, are giuen you of God to vſe; but not to abuſe in ſurfeting and dronkenneſſe.
                        Remember that they are giuen you to profit your bodies, and not to hurt your ſoules.
                        Remember that they are not giuen to you alone, but vnto others alſo that need the ſame, by your liberalitie and almes to their releefe.
                        In eating and drinking, remember that you doo but feed the woormes, and pamper the carcaſſe, and ouercharge your ſoule if yee ſurfet with taking too much.
                        In the midſt of your mirth and abundance, remember the poore priſoners, the ſicke; and the afflictions of Ioſeph, and his perſecuted members, as though yee were in their caſe.
                        Finallie, remember the food of your ſoules, Chriſts bodie broken, and his bloud ſhead. Deſire the meate, I ſaie, that laſteth for euer. Labour for it, and harken diligentlie to his word, which now ſhall be read vnto you. And firſt let vs praie.
                     
                     
                        A praier to be ſaid of the child or ſeruant in the meale time, before the reading of the Chapter out of the Bible.
                        
                           O Lord, which haſt prouided theſe earthlie creatures for the feeding of our mortall bodies, direct vs carefullie to ſeeke, and with delight to taſt of thy moſt holie word, that we may by that immortall ſeed be begotten

to be thy children, and thereby be nouriſhed and fed, vntill we become perfect men in thy Sonne Chriſt Ieſus, So be it.
                        
                     
                     
                        Or elſe thus:
                        
                           BLeſſed Lord, which haſt not onlie created all things for mans ſuſtenance, but alſo haſt cauſed all holie Scripture to be written for our learning, grant vs to be ſo conuerſant among theſe thy gifts purelie and holilie, becauſe thou art ſo, that we may in ſuch ſort alſo now both reade thy word, heare it, marke, learne, and inwardlie digeſt this heauenlie food of our ſoules, that being well refreſhed, and vertuouſlie tranſformed both in bodie and ſoule, we may holilie walke in the ſtrength thereof, to glorifie thee, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        After the Chapter read, ſaie thus:
                        
                           BLeſſed are they that heare the word of God, and keepe it. Grant therefore we beſeech thee, O Lord, that we may not onlie be readers and hearers of thy word, but dooers and followers alſo of the ſame; that beeing now fed and nouriſhed at thy hands both in ſoule and bodie, we may heere bee apt and readie to doo all good works, which thou haſt prepared for vs to walke in, and in the life to come be receiued to thine eternall kingdome of glorie, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        
                        Another thanks-giuing after the receiuing of our bodilie ſustenance, and reading of ſome part of Gods holie word, or ſpirituall food.
                        
                        
                           O Lord our God, the onlie giuer of all good gifts, who of thy great mercies haſt made vs partakers both of the heauenlie gifts of thy holie word, to feed our minds; and of thine earthlie creatures, for the neceſſarie ſuſtenance of our weake bodies: grant we beſeech thee, that through thy grace, theſe thy gifts may be made perfect vnto vs. Giue ſtrength vnto our meate, that it may be our healthfull nouriſhment, not to breed in vs anie carnall deſire of our vaine life; but to enable our bodies with all good works, during the time of this preſent pilgrimage, that ſo thy good creatures may be our good releefe ſo long as thou wilt, and ſo much as thou knoweſt to be expedient for vs thy ſeruants to finiſh our daies, which thou haſt numbred in the edifieng of thy Saincts, and glorifieng of thy holie name.
                        And becauſe, O Lord, we knowe nothing of our ſelues, but our ignorant harts are full of darkeneſſe; therefore we beſeech thee, that this thy word (which is thine eternall wiſdome) that now we haue read (and wherein we haue had our conference) may be in our minds a burning lampe and ſhining light of thine onlie truth in our harts, and in our ſoules a fruitefull ſeed of a new birth: ſo that thine owne image may be happilie againe reſtaured in vs; that we may bee made before thee a holie and righteous people, by the inward working of thy gratious ſpirit, dailie ſtrengthening our harts in earneſt loue of thy truth, and carefull obedience of thy commandements, through

Ieſus Chriſt our onlie mediator, who in the ſacrifice of his owne bodie, hath purchaſed vnto vs all thy fauour, and hath giuen vs boldneſſe to call vpon thee, vnto whome, O father, with thee, and the holie Ghoſt, bee all honour and glorie, world without end,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another praier after meate on the Lords daie.
                        
                           SAnctified be thy name, O eternall father, who by thy Sonne Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, dooeſt euermore protect and prouide for thy Church both ſpirituall and corporall bleſſings, beſtowing moſt liberallie vpon vs all good things aſked according to thy will. Lift vp thine eies, O Chriſt, and behold thy miſerable people, which depend altogither vpon thy prouiſion, and acknowledge our ſelues to be fed, and defended miraculouſlie by thee. Aſſiſt vs, that we alſo may withdrawe our eies from the conſultations of fleſh and bloud, and looke vpon thee our Lord, by whoſe bleſſing we eate and ſtore our ſelues. And albeit, all worldlie helps do faile, yet bee thou a firie wall ſtill about vs, and feed and defend thy Saincts in the feelds of comfort, vntill thou begin that ioifull Paſſouer, and euerlaſting Sabboth, and bring vs out of the wilderneſſe, out of the ſea and penurie, into the court of ioie, wealth, ſatietie, and euerlaſting welfare. In the meane while, make vs thankfull for the benefits which we enioie. Let vs gather vp the remnants or fragments caſt from thy ſumptuous and rich banket vnto vs. Preſerue our baſkets, and bleſſe our ſtore, euen the arts and ſchooles of learning, that by them thy doctrine may be ſpread abroade in the world. Make vs not onlie to honour thee for theſe thy corporall benefits, but much more for giuing thy ſelfe vnto vs, which art the bread of life. Be

thou our King, defending vs in this life againſt the power of Sathan, and feed vs with thy heauenlie bread, which may nouriſh vs to eternall life and happineſſe,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another praier after meate that daie you haue receiued the holie Communion.
                        
                        
                           SEeing that of thy free grace and mercie, O almightie God, thou haſt made vs partakers this daie of all thy riches, both in ſpirituall and corporall things in Chriſt Ieſu, who of our ſelues are vnwoorthie to haue gathered the crumbs vnder thy table, make vs more and more mindfull of ſo great mercies, and continuallie thankefull to thee for ſo manifold benefits, and to walke woorthie the honour and dignitie thou haſt done vnto vs, that we may receiue the full accompliſhment of thy loue towards vs in the life to come, through the ſame our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, to whom with thee and the holie Ghoſt be all honour and glorie world without end,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another thanks-giuing vnto God for our food, to be read and meditated vpon after meate.
                        
                        
                           WE thanke thee, O King of glorie, Lord of heauen and earth, becauſe thou haſt from our youth to this preſent houre, maruellouſlie nouriſhed vs, giuing vs meate, drinke, & cloathing, with all other things perteining to the ſuſtentation of this preſent life. Naked and bare came we out of our mothers wombs: wee brought nothing into the world, but whatſoeuer we haue, thou

gaueſt the ſame; yea it was afore we were borne, and in our mothers wombe, didſt thou ordeine things neceſſarie for this life, and ſufferedſt vs to enioie all things aboundantlie. Alwaie thou haſt a care of vs, as a father vſeth his children; neither art thou ignorant that we ſtand in need continuallie of thy bleſſings, and dailie are deſtitute of new releefe, all which thou giueſt after thy woonted and vnſpeakable goodneſſe.
                        We acknowledge that whatſoeuer we haue or poſſeſſe, it is thy gift, and confeſſe thee to be the fountaine of all good things, and perceiue thy fatherlie goodneſſe to be ſpread, not onlie ouer all mankind, but alſo ouer the liuing creatures. Thou giueſt meate to all fleſh, thou giueſt fodder to the cattell, and feedeſt the yoong rauens that call vpon thee. For corporall goods are not diſtributed among men by chance, or without thy prouidence; neither be they atteined by the onlie induſtrie and power of man. Thou giueſt, and we gather; thou openeſt thy hand, and all liuing creatures are filled with thy bleſſing. For without thee all our endeuours be in vaine, and if thou bleſſe not our labours, we doo but eate the wind, and receiue no profit.
                        Great is thy mercie, O Lord, which diſdaineſt not to prouide for ſinfull fleſh. O Lord our God, great are thy woonderous works, which thou haſt done for vs, the which we can not ſo much as in thought comprehend, muchleſſe in words expreſſe. When we would report and vtter them, we found them more than we could recite: but notwithſtanding thine infinite benefits can not be comprehended of mortall man, yet will we not ſurceaſe to ſet foorth thy praiſe, nor hide thy goodneſſe from the ſonnes of men; but will declare it, and ſpeake of thy truth from one generation to another.
                        Bleſſed art thou, O our God, for euer and euer; all that is either aboue in the heauens, or in the earth beneath,

is thine. All things come from thee, and from thine hands we receiue whatſoeuer we poſſeſſe, and all theſe things of thy meere mercie, without our merits or woorthineſſe. Therefore we will magnifie the Lord, which doth mightie things in all corners of the earth, which dooth nouriſh vs from our mothers wombs, and giueth vs all good things. Grant vs likewiſe quietneſſe of mind, and peace in our time, that thy grace may abound toward vs, continue, and defend vs while we liue.
                        O almightie and mercifull father, by thy breath we take life, the which through thy bleſſing doth abide in vs. In thee we liue, moue, and haue our being. For man liueth not by bread onlie, or by his owne wiſedome and forecaſt, neither art thou bound with a fatall chaine of ſecond cauſes, but by thy decree and will we enioie life, and all things created at thy becke, doo continue, while thou thinkeſt good. Giue vs not onlie ſtore of all things to the neceſſitie of life, but grant alſo to our meate and drinke vertue and power to releeue and ſtrengthen our bodies. For thou alone vpholdeſt all things by thy word of power. Unleſſe thou dailie didſt feed vs with the hidden grace, which thou dooeſt inſpire into the bread to feed vs, all the heapes of our yeerelie increaſe were to ſmall purpoſe. For be it, that there be aboundance of wheate, wine, and of all other things, yet vnleſſe they be watered by thy bleſſing, quicklie would all come to naught, and we ſhould periſh for lacke of food in all that aboundance. For all the ſubſtance that we poſſeſſe, what is it, without thou proſper and fructifie the ſame with thy bleſſing?
                        And albeit we feed on bread, yet we aſcribe not our life to the vertue of the bread; neither is thy power tied to the bread; nor mans life included within the ſame, but altogither it dependeth vpon thy will and good pleaſure. We beſeech thee for thy moſt large and

bountifull liberalitie, caſt vs not off in the time of our old age; and when our ſtrength faileth vs, forſake vs not. Likewiſe, confirme our faith, that we diſtruſt not thy promiſes; neither be driuen from thee by anie meanes, ſeeme they neuer ſo contrarie to naturall cauſes: but giue grace that we may withdrawe our eies from all worldlie conſultations, and as touching our food, and other neceſſaries for this life, may wholie depend vpon thee, and at no time go beyond the limits which thou haſt prepared, through our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, which liueth and reigneth with thee for euermore,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        At noone-tide, or mid-daie, ſaie thus:
                        
                           O Lord my light, my inlightning, and my welfare, from whence all true brightneſſe and light doth come: grant I beſeech thee, that as of thy goodneſſe thou haſt giuen me thus plentifullie this corporall light to compaſſe my bodie on euerie ſide, ſo of thy mercie giue me aboundantlie the ſpirituall light of thy grace and knowledge, which may inlighten my mind, and cauſe mine age to appeare as cleere as the noone daie. And becauſe, O Lord, nothing in this world is ſo perfect and glorious, but when it is at the full, it will decreaſe and weare awaie: euen as we ſee in the courſe of this thy glorious creature the Sunne, which now being at the higheſt, will begin to drawe downeward. Graunt alſo, I beſeech thee, that when at the age of fortie yeeres my bodie by little and little ſhall begin to fade, and the beautie thereof wither, and drawe towards an end, it togither with my ſoule, in the daie of iudgement, may ſhine as bright as the Sunne, being now at the higheſt, doth; and may then begin to be glorified to the full, in

the region of the celeſtiall world, where the Sunne of all righteouſneſſe, and the brightneſſe of perpetuall charitie and felicitie doth euerlaſtinglie ſhine, and inlighten all the holie companie of heauen,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Or elſe thus:
                        
                           LOrd let thy fauour preuent vs, as doth the Sunne, which being now in the higheſt region, ſpreadeth his beames ouer all the parts of the earth. And as the brightneſſe therof ſhineth now without the clouds: after the ſame ſort giue vs thy cleereneſſe, and ſhewe thy bright countenance ouer vs, that lightened by thy word, wee may walke this daie thorough, circumſpectlie and warilie in the waies of thy commandements; that being blinded in the mid daie, we run not headlong into darkeneſſe, neither grope at noone daie as in the night, wandering from the paths of thy iudgements. Open thine eies, O God, ouer vs, & be thou vnto vs a mightie protector this daie, a firmament of ſtrength, a couering againſt heate & parching, a ſhadow at noone tide, a defender from offence, an aſſiſter from falling, a comforter of our ſoules, a lightener of our minds, and a giuer of health and happines in Chriſt our Lord,
                        Amen.
                        ¶ After meate, the better to keepe you from vaine exerciſes, and idle cogitations, and to ſpend the Sabboth daie both wholie and holilie to the Lord as it behooueth; take occaſion on Gods name either to cathechiſe your children and familie, or to praie for the preſeruation of the Queenes moſt excellent maieſtie, or to reade deuoutlie ſome of theſe godlie meditations and praiers of Gods works, and feaſts following.
                     
                     
                        
                        
                           On Sundaie. A praier for the right keeping of the Sabboth or Sundaie.
                        
                        
                           O Eternall father of our Lord Ieſu Chriſt, which togither with thy Sonne, and the holie Ghoſt, didſt create man, & of thine infinite mercie powredſt into him a ſimilitude of thoſe things, which are moſt excellent in thee the fountaine of all goodneſſe; and wouldeſt in that nature, as it were in a Temple (ſeeing thine image to ſhine therein) continue, and celebrate the ioifull Sabboth. When man had defaced thine image, and was pluckt from thee, it was thy will that the Sonne of thine owne ſubſtance ſhould take our fleſh vpon him, and be made a ſacrifice for the ſinnes of mankind, bee crucified, die; yea and on the great Sabboth daie of the lawe, lie in the graue, where the word after an vnſpeakable manner reſted, that we may receiue againe the ſocietie of the new and celeſtiall Sabboth.
                        We beſeech thee grant that thy Sonne, which is the Lord of that Sabboth, may begin in this life to reſt in vs; to heale the corruptions of our nature by his holie ſpirit, which is the heauenlie fire; to drie vp the dropſie of our fleſh; that he may loue vs, which are bone of his bones, to make vs one with him through his ſpirit; and finallie, to bring vs into that glorious companie, where the eternall Sabboth is in ſuch excellencie, as can not be conceiued by the hart of man.
                        In the meane while, let vs ceaſſe from this hurlie burlie, this toiling, and drudging, in the vaine trumperie of this world; ſo as once at laſt we may religiouſlie halowe, and keepe the godlie reſt of the new Sabboth, in doing ſuch things as be allowable and pleaſant vnto

thee, and ſanctifieng thee in true reſt and peace. Drawe vs from the vaine fantaſies of preſent things, that we may attend and await vpon thee, and thy ioifull comming. Grant I ſaie, that we may be humbled vnder thy mightie hand, that we may knowe our infirmities, obeie thee in our croſſes and correction, looke vnto thee in a liuelie faith and hope of a ioifull deliuerance, which then ſhall be perfect, when thy Sonne by his trumpet ſhall ſummon the new Sabboth, and drawe vnto him on high, where he ſitteth at thy right hand exalted, thine elect; all thine enimies, which through beaſtlie arrogancie bluſhed not to contend and fight againſt thee, being ſubdued,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another.
                        
                           ALmightie God, and moſt mercifull heauenlie father, who after that in ſixe daies thou haddeſt created all things, didſt reſt the ſeauenth daie, and ſanctifiedſt it; teach vs to keepe holie the Sabboth daie, not in ſhew and cercmonie onlie, but much more in euerie good woorke, which thou haſt commanded; not in part for faſhion ſake, but wholie and to the end for thine owne glorie ſake. And wee beſeech thee, O Lord, to heale not onlie our heads and limmes, but alſo our harts and ſoules; that we may both in the lawfull keeping of thy Sabboth, and all other thy commandements, be obedient vnto thee the Lord of the Sabboth. And as thou haſt taught vs the right keeping of the Sabboth to ſtand chieflie in dooing of good one vnto another, giue vs grace continuallie to keepe this Sabboth inuiolable, and vnprophaned, that we may onlie doo thoſe things which are holie and acceptable vnto thee, and may ceaſſe from all our lewd works and waies. And eſpeciallie, O Lord,

grant that we may auoid carefullie the firſt ſtep of the ladder that leadeth to that horrible ſinne of blaſphemie, which is not to be forgiuen, neither in this world, nor in the world to come,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Ghoſtlie Meditations, with the which it is meete for vs Chriſtians to occupie our ſelues once in the daie, or at the leaſt (for thoſe, whoſe leaſure will not ſerue) once in the weeke, and that euerie Sundaie and holie daie: which the Author found in an old and ancient written copie: & for the excellent matter therin conteind, hath thought it good now to publiſh it, to the glorie of God, and profit of his Church.
                        
                           FIrſt, let vs call to our memorie the bountifull goodneſſe of almightie GOD, extended towards vs in the creation of the firmament, the earth, the ſea, and all that therein is conteined; which he hath made for our onelie comfort, and the ſeruice of vs. And let vs here with alſo conſider the greatneſſe and omnipotencie of his power, which was able with his word onlie of nothing to make althings, & thoſe ſo wonderfull works, that they are not able to be comprehended within the compaſſe of mans reaſon. Call we alſo to mind the vnſearchableneſſe of his diuine wiſedome, through which in ſo goodlie order continuallie he both can, & doth conſerue all thoſe things: and laſtlie, let vs not forget his incomparable loue towards vs, who of his onlie meere goodneſſe, without anie part of ableneſſe of our deſerts, hath prouided all theſe things for our vſe: and not onlie that; but hath moreouer made vs of capacitie and vnderſtanding to diſcuſſe, and knowe how to vſe the ſame, for the ſeruing of our neceſſities, as the diuerſitie of times and occaſion requireth. Let vs not

therefore ſhew our ſelues vnto him vnthankfull.
                        Nextlie, let vs call to mind from how ſundrie perils, as well ghoſtle as bodilie, he hath and dooth from time to time preſerue vs: namelie, from perils on the land, perils by water, perils of fire, perils through ſicknes, from impriſonment, from open ſhame, from ſlanders, from extreme beggerie, from famine, from peſtilence, and other horrible diſeaſes; from ſudden and ſhamefull death, and ſundrie other miſchiefes, which we may vnderſtand to haue happened, and dailie doo perceiue to happen vnto others; which ſhould in like ſort haue happened vnto vs, if through his mercifull goodneſſe we had not beene therefrom preſerued: and herewith let vs alſo call vnto mind, our health, our wealth, and all other Gods good gifts, which he hath lent vnto vs, and render vnto him moſt humble thanks therefore.
                        Alſo, let vs thinke how he hath made vs of no vile ſort nor condition; but euen vnto his owne likeneſſe, indued with the moſt pretious gifts of reaſon, vnderſtanding, memorie and will; which noble gifts he hath giuen vs, to the intent we ſhould with theſe honour him accordinglie: which if we doo not; but doo abuſe the ſame, to worldlie, vaine, and fantaſticall delights; we may then aſſure our ſelues, not onelie to make a ſtraight account thereof; but alſo to be moſt greeuouſlie puniſhed therefore.
                        Moreouer, let vs call to mind how mercifull, and like a moſt louing Maiſter and Sauior, Chriſt the Sonne of God, and ſecond perſon in Trinitie, Lord and king ouer all rule and power, deſcended downe from the boſome of his Father, and from his heauenlie throne into this miſerable world, and here tooke vpon him our fraile fleſh; ſuffering in the ſame by the ſpace of three and thirtie yeeres, hunger, thirſt, cold, watch, pouertie, euil report, hatred, diſdaine, ſlanders, rebukes, checks, taunts, ſcornes, buffets, binding, beating, whipping,

wrongfull accuſation, falſe condemnation; yea, and at the laſt, moſt vile, ſpitefull, cruell, and ſhamefull death; and that innocentlie and giltleſſe, thereby to deliuer vs from our gilt, and the eternall death, which all we, by the tranſgreſſion of our firſt parent Adam, had moſt iuſtlie deſerued. And herewith let vs alſo thinke what reproch & ſhame it is to vs, to repine or grudge to ſuffer the like for his ſake: ſith he being both our Lord and Maiſter, of the ſingular loue he did beare vnto vs, hath ſuffered all thoſe for our ſakes: ſhould not we then, being but ſeruants (or rather vile ſlaues in reſpect of him) diſdaine or repine at that, which he, not onelie our Maiſter; but King ouer all kings hath not diſdained to ſuffer?
                        Alſo, let vs conſider how that by the merits of his moſt bitter paſſion, and his grace giuen vnto vs in the Sacrament of baptiſme, he hath forgiuen vs, cleerelie clenſed vs, and vtterlie diſcharged vs of all our former ſinnes. Herevpon, let vs call to mind, how oft ſince that time we haue offended him, by falling againe into deadlie ſinne; & therewith let vs call to remembrance the particularitie of our offences, the greeuouſneſſe of the ſame, how long we haue continued in them without repentance taken for them: and then let vs weigh the abundance of his great mercie; firſt, how gratiouſlie he hath abidden the time of our repentance; how readie he hath beene to forgiue vs vpon due repentance taken, and perfect confeſſion without diſſimulation made thereof vnto him.
                        Remember we alſo, how lewdlie, how wickedlie, and how ſinfullie we haue beſtowed the ſhort time, which God hath here in this world lent vnto vs, to fight and warre continuallie againſt our moſt mortall aduerſaries, the world, the fleſh, and the diuell, which trauell without ceaſſing to worke our euerlaſting deſtruction, and to bring vs to euerlaſting death; and to beereue

vs from the life eternall, & ioies endleſſe. Thinke we alſo, if God of his great mercie had not gratiouſlie ſpared vs life, vntill we had repented that wickednes; in what wretched condition, and moſt extreme torments of hell paines, had we beene in now; and ſo ſhould haue continued for euer world without end? But how deere then ſhould thoſe ſhort pleaſures and vaine delights of the fleſh haue beene vnto vs?
                        Let vs alſo call to mind the houre of death, the vncerteintie of the time thereof, and that we knowe not when where, or in what maner it ſhall be: but like as we are moſt certeine we can not eſcape it; ſo are wee as ſure, if we happen then to depart this life in deadlie ſinne, that we ſhall then not onelie die the bodilie death; but alſo the ſpirituall death, which is eternall death both of bodie and ſoule. Let vs therefore endeuour our ſelues, ſo to liue, as though euerie houre ſhould be vnto vs the laſt houre; and by that meanes we ſhall not be vnreadie, how ſuddenlie ſoeuer death ſhall ſteale vpon vs, nor yet ſhall we feare his cōming.
                        Furthermore, let vs thinke what ſhall become of our wretched bodies, and vile carcaſes, which we haue ſought by all meanes to pamper; whoſe eaſe wee haue ſo much procured; which we haue ſo delicatelie nouriſhed; which we haue ſo finelie araied; whoſe vaine pleaſures we haue ſo much followed: doubtleſſe, it ſhall then become an abhominable ſtinking carion; from which, thoſe which be now our moſt deereſt friends ſhall be forced to turne awaie their heads, ſtopping of their noſes, for the verie noiſomneſſe of the corrupt ſauour and euill ſtinch thereof.
                        Let vs alſo conſider, what ſhall then auaile vs for our poſſeſſions and riches, which we haue ſought for ſo buſilie, and ſo greedilie to heape togither. We muſt then leaue behind vs, and of them ſhall carie awaie nothing with vs, ſauing a heauie burden of conſcience of

ſuch part of them, which we doo vnlawfullie poſſeſſe, wrongfullie withhold, or elſe haue euill gotten.
                        Let vs then weigh, what ſhall become of our ſoule, when it ſhall leaue the bodie to rot in the earth, and it ſelfe ſhall be called into iudgement before the high Iudge, where it ſhall be forced to make a ſtreight account of all works, words, and thoughts. Where it ſhall be able to conceale nothing; but the verie ſecrets of all our dooings ſhall then be made open: and that which here we be aſhamed to confeſſe; ſhall then be manifeſt; and the booke ſhall be opened, in which all our deeds and thoughts ſhall be rehearſed, before the whole companie of heauen, and then ſhall be ſaid to euerie one of vs: Behold this man and his works: then ſhall our conſcience accuſe vs, all our euill deeds as witneſſes ſhall come in againſt vs. The diuell ſhall be there readie to drawe vs with him into eternall perdition, and with the terribleneſſe of his countenance ſhall put vs in horrible feare. Then ſhall we tremble and quake, and deſire to haue reſpite for the amendement of our former wicked life, and to repent vs of our ſinfull liuing: but then in no wiſe it may bee granted vs, for aſmuch as then mercie muſt giue place to iuſtice. Let vs now therefore, while God doth lend vs time, repent in time; which if we doo vnfeinedlie, then may we aſſure our ſelues to receiue mercie and forgiueneſſe of God: for aſmuch as he willeth not the death of a ſinner, but rather that he ſhould conuert and liue.
                        Then, let vs alſo weigh with our ſelues, what a noble thing our ſoule is, & how greeuous hir wounds were: for the curing of the which, our Sauiour Chriſt was of neceſſitie wounded. Yea, if thoſe had not beene vnto death, and that death eternall, the ſonne of God ſhould neuer haue ſuffered. Shall we then lightlie eſteeme of the loſſe of the ſoule, vnto whom we may perceiue ſo

much compaſſion to be ſhewed of ſo great a Maieſtie? Then ſith he hath ſhed his teares for vs, let vs likewiſe nightlie waſh our beds with cōpunction of hart, and continuall teares, for verie heauineſſe that wee haue ſo greeuouſlie offended ſo louing a Maiſter. And ſith he hath ſhed his pretious bloud for vs, ſhed we ours alſo in a ſort: that is to ſaie, with dailie affliction, and mortifieng of our bodies. And let vs not haue regard what the fleſh deſireth, but what is moſt conuenient for our ſoules health. For then ſhall our ſoules be glorious, when they ſhall returne to our Lord God by true repentance and penitence.
                        Let vs then call to remembrance the louers of this world, that were here among vs not long agone, what is now become of them: and that nothing remaineth of them but duſt and woormes. They haue beene men as we are: they ſolicited and vſed all kind of mirth; they banketed; they were gorgiouſlie apparelled, they were verie pleaſant, and led their daies in all worldlie delights: but ſuddenlie, and as it were in the midſt of their iolitie, death areſted them, & caried them downe into hell. Here the fleſh of them is appointed to feede the woormes; and there their ſoules be euermore tormented in the vnquenchable flame of hell fire, where now they find no profit of all thoſe fleſhlie pleaſures, worldlie reioicings, and euill concupiſcence. And for ſo ſhort and vaine pleaſures, what continuall torment and miſerie doo they now endure: where they neuer ſee light; neuer receiue eaſe of their paine, nor comfort of their heauineſſe: where the fire continuallie burneth them, and yet neuer conſumeth them; nor by his long burning leeſeth anie part of his heate? Where the woorms doo gnawe their conſcience; where the diuels, which are their tormentors, waxe neuer wearie in tormenting of them, or take anie pitie on them, nor will be intreated to mitigate anie part of their torment.

Where nothing ſhall be heard; but weeping, lamentation, groning, and wofull criengs. Where they ſhall ſauour and ſmell nothing; but horrible ſtinch and corrupt aire. Where they ſhall ſee nothing; but the monſtrous ſhape of the horible tormentors the diuels. Wherefore, let vs now aduiſe our ſelues, whether in folowing of the vaine worldlie pleaſures, we will giue our ſoules in like ſort to be eternallie tormented; or elſe in refuſing them, for the little times of paines we ſhall here ſuffer, to reioice with Chriſt, and to be bleſſed Saints in heauen for euer. For whileſt we are here in this world, God dooth ſet before vs both fire and water; that is to ſaie, ſaluation and damnation; that vnto which we will we may ſtretch our hands.
                        Let vs laſtlie conſider what comfort it is, and ſhall be to all ſaued ſoules to ſee God, and the brightneſſe of his face; to liue with God, to poſſeſſe God, which is high and perfect goodneſſe; and where the perfect goodneſſe is, there is the higheſt, and moſt perfect felicitie; there is the chiefe and perfect charitie; eternall ſuretie, and ſure eternitie; true gladneſſe; full knowledge; all beautie; all bliſſe. In this ſort ſhall the man be bleſſed with God, in whoſe conſcience ſhall be found no ſinne; he ſhall ſee God after his owne deſire; he ſhall poſſeſſe to pleaſure, and enioie to gladneſſe; he ſhall flouriſh in eternitie; he ſhall ſhine in veritie; he ſhall ioie in righteouſneſſe; and as he ſhall haue eternitie of continuance, ſo he ſhall haue facilitie of knowledge, and felicitie of reſt. He ſhall be delighted in God; whoſe countenance is amiable; whoſe face is beautifull; whoſe ſpeech is pleaſant. He is delectable to behold; ſweet to poſſeſſe; pleaſant to enioie. In him vnderſtanding is made cleere; affection is purified, that we may loue and knowe him as he is: ſo that then wee ſhall not need to ſeeke anie thing beſides him. For the whole is found in him, ſo much as is to be deſired, or

may poſſiblie reioice or delight vs.
                        Let vs to conclude, finallie thinke, what madneſſe doth then poſſeſſe vs, ſo much to thirſt after the bitter potion of ſinne, to followe after vanities of this world, to ſuffer the incommodities of this ſlipperie life, and the dominion of Sathans tyrannie; and not rather to flee vp to the felicitie of Saincts, to the fellowſhip of Angels, and to the ſolemnitie of the heauenlie ioies, where we ſhall ſee, behold, and enioie the plentifull aboundant riches of the ineſtimable treaſures of Gods goodneſſe, for euer and euer world without end,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        A meditation of Gods woonderfull works, and a thanks-giuing for our creation.
                        
                        
                           O Moſt heauenlie father, and eternall God, which art neither made, nor begotten, but before all worlds from euerlaſting diddeſt beget a Sonne, an image of thine owne ſubſtance: we honor thee, we praiſe thee, we glorifie thee, we yeeld thee moſt hartie thanks for all thy benefits, eſpeciallie for creating the heauens, the Sunne, Moone, and all the ſtarres, by thy liuelie word, for gouerning through thy wiſdome, and for thy gratious mainteining them.
                        The Sunne in his vpriſing doth manifeſt the daie, a woonderfull worke of the higheſt. Great is the Lord which made, and commanded the ſame to take his courſe from the top of heauen, vnto the end thereof. The ornaments of heauen be the glorious ſtarres: the Lord on high doth lighten the world; at his commandement they keepe their order, and will not faile, nor be wearie in their watch.
                        O Lord our God, how woonderfull is thy name in all the world, which haſt ſet thy glorie aboue the heauens!

Out of the mouth of babes and ſucklings wilt thou be praiſed, becauſe of thine enimies, that thou maiſt confound thine aduerſaries, and him that enuieth thy renowme. We ſee the workemanſhip of thy hands, the Moone, and Starres, which thou haſt ordeined; and we will ſignifie thy glorie vnto all nations, and among all people will we declare thy woonderfull things. For thou art mightie, O Lord, and worthie to be praiſed: great is thy vertue, and thy power woonderfull.
                        We thanke thee, holie father, God of heauen; becauſe thou haſt created by thy word of power the vniuerſall world, with all the creatures, and whatſoeuer is, liueth, or moueth in the ſame. By thy wiſdome thou dooeſt gouerne, and by ſending of thy ſpirit, as yet doeſt vphold, and cheriſh the ſame. For all woods, fruitfull trees, ſtones, graine, flowers, herbes, and all the graſſe of the feeld haſt thou ordeined for the vſe of man. Wee magnifie thee, O God moſt wiſe, for creating the Sea, and ſprings of water, by the power of thy word; and for giuing them vertue to bring foorth fiſhes of all kind to be eaten of man. We bleſſe thee, O eternall God, for making the ſuperiour and lower regions of the aire, with all birds and feathered fowles of ſundrie kinds, for the food of man. We glorifie thee, for giuing the whole frame of this earth, with all the creatures in the ſame, vnto mankinde; and ſetting man ouer the works of thine hands, haſt ſubiected all things vnder his feet, all ſheepe and oxen, yea and all the beaſts of the feeld, the fowles of the aire, and the fiſh of the Sea, which walke through the paths of the Sea.
                        Eſpeciallie we praiſe thee, our Lord and maker, for making vs thy creatures reaſonable men and women, according to thine owne ſimilitude; for giuing vs reaſon, and all the ſenſes; and for preſeruing vs hitherto. Thou didſt nouriſh vs, and that woonderfullie,

being within our mothers wombe, and out thereof haſt thou brought vs ſound in all parts, without imperfection; and yet continueſt thy fauour, and dooeſt keepe vs againſt all dangers, and deliuereſt vs from all euill: and all theſe things dooeſt thou of thy fatherlie and diuine goodneſſe, without anie merit or deſert of ours; for all which we are bound to thanke thee, to praiſe thee, to ſerue, honor, and obeie thee.
                        We extoll thy ſacred name, O God moſt high, for ſeparating from the reſt a Sabboth daie, that ſo men (ceaſſing from their handie labour) might the better ſerue and celebrate thine honour.
                        Who is he that can recite all the power of the Lord, or declare all his works? Who can number out all his praiſes? No man can vtter all his benefits. Notwithſtanding, although we be miſerable men, and wretched ſinners, and therefore moſt vnmeete to extoll thee according to thy deſerts: yet will we not be ſtill, we will praiſe thee euermore to the vttermoſt of our power. We will declare thy iuſtice and mercie: and while we liue, we remember thy goodneſſe, and at no time forget thy benefits. O our ſoules, praiſe the Lord; we will praiſe the Lord during our life; we will ſing to the Lord while we haue breath. We will bee mindfull of our maker, euen from our youth, and ſeeke him euermore: yea euen vnto our old age, and graie head. O God, forſake vs not, vntill we haue declared thy power vnto all nations that are to come. Praiſe the Lord, all ye nations; praiſe him all ye people. For his louing kindnes is great toward vs; and his truth endureth for euer. Praiſe ye the Lord in his Sanctuarie; praiſe him in the firmament of his power; praiſe him in his mightie acts: praiſe him according to his excellent greatneſſe. Let euerie thing that hath breath, praiſe the Lord. Praiſe ye the Lord,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        
                        Another meditation and thanks-giuing for the creation of the world.
                        
                        
                           MOſt mightie, moſt wiſe, and moſt maruellous Lord GOD; which of nothing haſt created heauen and earth, with all that is therein; and haſt prepared with due & new properties, euerie worke which thou haſt brought foorth by thy diuine word & holie commandement; and haſt ordeined and eſtabliſhed all the holie works of thy hands; ſo that they yet ſtand and ſerue to the vſe and ſeruice of men. For through the courſe of the heauens, which neuer ſtand ſtill, is ingendered vnto vs all that euer we haue need of; and through the ſame courſe alſo dieth, withereth, and rotteth, all that is old; bicauſe that for the old and decaied, there ſhould ariſe vp new and freſh. And this courſe haſt thou, O mightie God, made ſo maruellouſlie, and ſo agreeably, that man (thorough the agreeable works of thine hands, without anie other externall learning, teaching, or inſtruction) might come to the knowledge of that, which is inuiſible in thee; that is, thy holie, exalted, and euerlaſting bleſſed Godhead and inuiſible might. Inſomuch as there is none that can make himſelfe vngiltie, and inexcuſable of miſbeleefe or ignorance, how farre ſoeuer he be departed from thy holie word. For the verie heauens giue knowledge inough of thy diuine glorie; the which, though they haue no tongue to ſpeake, neither doo we heare anie thing of their mouth: yet neuertheleſſe their voice is gone out to all corners of the world, and there is no place, but men heare their voice ſounding in their eares. For no man is ſo farre diſtant from them, but he both feeleth alwaies the benefits that come from the heauens; and alſo ſeeth continuallie

thy maruellous handie works, which the firmament dooth ſhew and declare vnto vs.
                        We thanke thee, we praiſe thee, and we laud and magnifie thy glorious name, O moſt meeke Lord, for all thy benefits; eſpeciallie for that thou haſt not thought it inough for thee to haue giuen vs the heauens, and earth, and all that is therin to ſerue vs, and to inſtruct vs; but alſo haſt vouchſafed to ſend thine onlie deere beloued Sonne our Sauior Ieſus Chriſt downe amongſt vs into this vale of teares: and after that he was aſcended into heauen, haſt left vs thy holie word, and ſent thy holie Ghoſt into vs, to the intent we ſhould learne of him all truth, & in thy word might in deed behold more effectuallie, better and cleerer thy Godhead. We now alſo praie and humbly beſeech thee, O moſt mercifull God, that thou wilt gouerne vs, and driue awaie from vs all fleſhlie conuerſation, to the intent we may hencefoorth liue a godlie and ghoſtlie life; ſo that we through the fleſh may not be hindered to paſſe our pilgrimage in ſuch perfection as thou requireſt in Chriſtian men: but that we may knowe and diſcerne, and vſe to thy glorie the vnmeaſurable great good things, which thy large and bountifull hand hath giuen and reached vnto vs, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        A meditation of mans creation.
                        
                           
                              O
                            Almightie Lord God, that haſt created heauen and earth, and all that is therein of naught; but eſpeciallie haſt made man vnto thine owne godlie image, infunding and creating in him a reaſonable ſoule, not mortall, nor tranſitorie, as are the ſoules of vnreaſonable beaſts: but ſuch a ſoule, as liueth like the ſpirit or ghoſt of God for euer. By which ſoule man knoweth thee to be his God,

doth beleeue thee, and ſhall behold thee. And with ſoule and bodie together, thou haſt made man aboue all other creatures ſo much ſuperiour: and haſt ſo highlie exalted him, that thou haſt made him prince and chiefe gouernour, lord and captaine ouer all thy other creatures, that be in the earth, and haſt caſt them all vnder his feet and ſubiection.
                        O moſt mercifull Lord, powre into vs thy heauenlie light, through which we may euer haue in due regard the vile and lothſome ſtuffe or matter that thy godlie hand hath made vs of; and how thou haſt neuertheleſſe exalted vs ſo mightilie of miſerie. Let vs knowe, I ſaie, O Lord, that man is crept out of the duſt and mire; and the woman but out of the rib of hir huſband; to the end we may not by anie meanes be puffed vp with pride, by vaine-glorie and preſumption of the great glorie wherewith thou haſt vouchſafed to endue and cloath vs: but that in true humilitie, we may impute and exhibit all things vnto thine onlie goodneſſe, clemencie, grace, and mercie. And that we may bee drawne thereby vnto the loue of thee, and to kindle the lampe of our ſoules, which is cold in thy loue, with the light of thy grace; ſo that we may diligentlie fulfill and accompliſh all that thou haſt commanded vs, and leaue that which thou haſt forbidden vs, like as it becommeth thine obedient children: ſo that we, both here in this vale of miſerie, and alſo afterward in that heauenlie paradiſe, being vndefiled, and like vnto thee, may be found like as thou haſt created vs, like vnto thine owne ſimilitude, image, & likeneſſe, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another meditation of mans creation.
                        
                           THine almightie hand, O GOD, keeping alwaies at one ſtaie, created the Angels in heauen, and the feelie woormes vpon earth; and yet was neither higher in the one, nor

lower in the other. For like as none other hand could haue created an Angel; ſo could none other hand haue created a woorme: like as none other could haue created heauen; ſo could none other haue created a leafe of a tree: like as none other could haue made a bodie; ſo could none other make a haire white or blacke; but onlie thine almightie hand, wherevnto all things are poſſible alike. For it is not more poſſible with thee to create a woorme, than an Angel; nor more impoſſible to ſpread out the heauen, than a leafe; nor eaſier to faſhion a haire, than to faſhion a bodie; nor vneaſier to ſtabliſh the earth vpon the waters, than the waters vpon the earth: but all that thou liſteſt to doo, that haſt thou done. According as thou liſtedſt, thou haſt made all things in heauen and in earth, and in the ſea, and in all deepe places: and among all other things, thou haſt made me according as thou liſtedſt, couldeſt, and kneweſt how to doo it. Certes, Lord, thy hand could haue made me ſome ſtone, or ſome bird, or ſome ſerpent, or ſome beaſt: and it knew how to haue done it; but it would not bicauſe of thy goodneſſe. Why then am I not a ſtone, ſome tree, or ſome beaſt? Trulie bicauſe thy goodneſſe hath ſo ordeined it, and bicauſe thou louedſt me firſt.
                        And why haſt thou done ſo to me, O maker of heauen and earth, and of the bottomleſſe deepe, who haſt no neede of me? Wherevpon commeth it that thou haſt thus loued me? For lo, I am, bicauſe thou haſt created me; and the cauſe that thou didſt create me, and account me in the number of thy creatures, was thy fore-ordinance from euerlaſting, before thou madeſt anie thing, euen from the beginning, before thou didſt ſpread all the heauens; when as yet there were no deepes; neither haddeſt thou yet made the earth, nor founded the mountaines, neither were anie waterſprings yet broken out. Before thou madeſt all theſe

things, I ſaie, which thou madeſt by thy word, thou foreſaweſt by the moſt aſſured prouidence of thy truth, that I ſhould be thy creature, and alſo thou willedſt that I ſhould be thy creature.
                        And whence commeth this to me, O moſt gentle Lord, moſt high God, moſt mercifull Father, and alwaies moſt meeke? What had I deſerued? What kindneſſe had I ſhewed, that it ſhould like thy roiall Maieſtie to create me? I was not; and thou diddeſt create me. I was nothing, and of nothing thou madeſt me ſomewhat. And what maner of ſomewhat? Not a drop of water; not fire; not a bird or fiſh; not a ſerpent, or ſome of the brute beaſts; not a ſtone, or a block; not of thoſe ſort of things, which haue but being onelie; or of thoſe things that haue but onelie being and growing; nor yet of thoſe kind of things that haue but onlie being, growing, and feeling. But aboue all theſe things, it was thy will to haue me both of that ſort, which haue but being onlie; for I am: and of thoſe that haue no more but being and growing; for I am, and growe: & alſo of thoſe kind of things, which haue both being, growing, and feeling; for I am, and alſo doo both growe and feele. Yea, and thou haſt made ſmall ods betweene me and the Angels. For I haue receiued reaſon to knowe thee and thy hand, as well as they.
                        But I did well to ſaie there was ſome ods betweene vs. For they haue the happie knowledge of thee alreadie in poſſeſſion; and I haue it but by hope: they ſee thee face to face; I ſee thee in a riddle through a glaſſe: they ſee thee fullie; and I but partlie. Howbeit when the thing commeth, which is perfect, then ſhall the vnperfect be done awaie, at ſuch time as we ſhall behold thee vncouered face to face. And what ſhould let vs to be counted little inferiour to Angels; ſeeing that thou O Lord, haſt crowned vs with the garland of hope, which is decked with glorie and honour; and ſeeing

thou haſt inhonoured vs exceedinglie as thy friends, or rather as fellowes and coequals in all things with thine Angels? Uerelie euen ſo ſaith thy truth; They are equall with the Angels, and they be the ſonnes of God. And what be they elſe, than the ſonnes of God, if they be made fellowes with the Angels? They ſhall be the ſonnes of God in verie deede. For the ſonne of man is become the ſonne of God. Trulie when I bethinke me of this, I am bold to ſaie, that man is not onlie little inferiour to the Angels, yea or haile-felowe with the Angels; but alſo ſuperiour to them: bicauſe a man is God, & God is a man, & not an Angel. And in this reſpect I may ſaie, that man is the woorthieſt creature, becauſe the word, which in the beginning was God with God: the word whereby God ſaid; Let light be made, and light was made: the word, whereby God created althings in the beginning, euen the ſelfe-ſame word became fleſh, and dwelt among vs, and we haue ſeene the glorie of it. Lo heere the glorie, when I glorie diſcreetlie; lo heere the ioie, when I ioie diſcreetlie; O Lord my God, the whole life and glorie of my ſoule!
                        Therefore I acknowledge vnto thee my Lord God, that when thou createdſt me indued with reaſon, thou didſt create me after a ſort equall with the Angels. For by thy word I may be perfect, to attaine to equalitie with the Angels; ſo as I may haue the adoption of thy children by thine onlie begotten word, O Lord; by thy deer beloued Son, in whom thou art well pleaſed, by our onelie coheire, which is of the ſame ſubſtance, & euerlaſtingnes that thou thy ſelfe art; yea euen by Ieſus Chriſt our onlie Lord and redeemer, our inlightner and comforter, our ſpokeſman with thee, & the light of our eies, who is our life, our ſauiour, our onlie hope, who hath loued vs more than himſelfe, by whome we haue aſſured truſt laid vp in ſtore, and ſtedfaſt faith to thee-ward, and entrance to come vnto thee, becauſe he

hath giuen them power to become the children of God, as manie as beleeue in his name.
                        I will giue praiſe vnto thy name, O Lord, who by creating me after thine owne image, haſt made me capable of ſo great glorie, as to become the ſonne of God. This trulie can not trees doo; this can not ſtones doo; this, to ſpeake generallie, can not anie of the things doo that moue or growe in the aire, or in the ſea, or on the earth; in aſmuch as he hath not giuen them power by thy word, to become the ſonnes of God: becauſe they haue not reaſon. For the power whereby we knowe, conſiſteth in reaſon. But he hath giuen this power vnto men, whome he created reaſonable, after his owne image and likeneſſe. Certeſſe Lord, it is by thy grace that I am a woman, and by grace I may be thy child, which thing the other can not be.
                        Whence haue I this, O Lord, the ſouereigne truth and true ſouereigne, and the beginning of all creatures? Whence haue I this, O Lord, that I may become the child of God, which the other things cannot? Thou art he that endureſt for euer, and thou haſt made all things at once. Thou haſt made man and beaſts, ſtones, and greene things of the earth all at once. For there went no deſert of theirs afore; there went no good turne of theirs afore. Thou haſt created all things onlie of thine owne goodneſſe; no creature hath deſerued more than other: for none of them had deſerued ought at all. And why then did thy goodneſſe ſhewe it ſelfe more in this creature, which thou haſt made reaſonable, than in all other that be without reaſon? Why was not I as all they be; or why are not all they as I am; or I alone as they be? What had I deſerued, that thou ſhouldeſt make me able to become the child of God, and denie the ſame abilitie to all the reſt? God forbid that I ſhould thinke ſo. It was thine onlie grace, it was thine onlie goodneſſe, which

brought it to paſſe, that I might be partaker of that ſweetneſſe. Of that grace therefore, whereby thou haſt created me of nothing, I beſeech thee, O Lord, to giue me the grace to be thankefull vnto thee.
                        And I thy creature will put my truſt vnder the ſhadowe of thy wings, and in the goodneſſe wherethrough thou haſt created me. Helpe thy creature, whome thy gratious goodneſſe hath created. Let not that periſh through my naughtineſſe, which thy goodneſſe hath wrought. Let not that periſh through my wretchedneſſe, which thy ſingular mercie hath made. For what auaileth it me that thou haſt created me, if I ſhall ſinke downe into mine owne corruption? O God, haſt thou made all the ſonnes of men in vaine? Thou haſt created me, O Lord: rule thou the thing that thou haſt created. Deſpiſe not the worke of thine owne hands, O God. Thou haſt made me of naught, O Lord; and if thou gouerne me not, I ſhall returne to naught againe. For like as when I was not, thou madeſt me of nothing: ſo if thou gouerne me not, I ſhall yet againe be brought to nothing in my ſelfe. Helpe me O Lord my life, leaſt I periſh in mine owne naughtineſſe.
                        Lord, if thou hadſt not created me, I ſhould not haue beene at all: but becauſe thou haſt created me, I am. Now if thou gouerne me not, I am vndone. For it was not mine owne merits, or mine owne deſerts (as I haue ſaid) that made thee to create me; but thine owne moſt gratious goodneſſe and mercifulnes. That louingneſſe of thine, O Lord my God, which made thee to create me, I beſeech thee let the ſame make thee to gouerne me. For what booteth it that thy louingneſſe cauſed thee to create me, if I muſt periſh in mine owne wretchedneſſe; and that thy right hand gouerne me not? O Lord my God, let this mercifulneſſe, which cauſed thee to create that that was not created, cauſe

thee alſo to ſaue that which is created. Let the louingneſſe, which wan thee to create, win thee alſo to ſaue; ſith it is no leſſe now than it was then. For thou art the verie loue and mercie it ſelfe, and thou continueſt alwaie one, vnchangeable, immortall, and inuiſible God, bleſſed and praiſed for euer and euer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        That God hath put all things vnder the ſeruice of man: and that by the conſideration of the temporall benefits, we coniecture the heauenlie wiſedome and goodneſſe of God.
                        
                        
                           THou, O gratious God, haſt put all things vnder mans feet, to the end that man alone ſhould wholie be ſubiect vnto thee. And to the end that man ſhould be wholie thine, thou haſt made man lord of all thy works. For thou haſt created all outward things for his bodie; his bodie for his ſoule; and his ſoule for thee; that he might ſerue thee onlie, and loue thee onlie, poſſeſſing thee to his comfort, and all inferiour things for his ſeruants. For whatſoeuer is conteined vnder the cope of heauen, is inferiour vnto mans ſoule, which was made to inherit the ſouereigne goodneſſe aboue, and to become happie by poſſeſſing it; wherevnto if he ſticke faſt, he ſhall ſurmount the need of all the inferiour things which are changeable; and in euerlaſting immortalitie quietlie behold the ſouereigne maieſtie, whereof he repreſenteth the image. Then ſhall he enioie thoſe excellent good things in the Lords houſe, in compariſon whereof, all the things that we ſee, are counted as nothing. Thoſe be the things which no eie hath ſeene, nor eare hard, nor hart of man conceiued, which God hath prepared for them that loue him. And trulie Lord theſe things wilt thou giue vnto my ſoule: with theſe dooeſt

thou (which loueſt mens ſoules) dailie glad the harts of thy ſeruants.
                        But why woonder I at theſe things my Lord God? Thou inhonoureſt thine owne image, and thine owne likeneſſe, wherevnto they were created. For to the end our bodie (though it be yet corruptible & baſe) might ſee, thou haſt giuen vs the light of the ſkie, by the hand of thine vnweariable ſeruants, the Sunne and Moone, who according to thy commandement, doo continuall ſeruice daie and night to thy children. To the intent it might breath, thou haſt granted vs the pure aire. To the intent it might heare, thou haſt giuen vs the diuerſitie of ſounds. To the intent it might ſmell, thou haſt giuen vs the ſweetneſſe of ſents. To the intent it might taſte, thou haſt giuen vs the qualities of ſauours. To the end it might feele, thou haſt giuen vs the ſubſtances of all bodilie things. To helpe vs in our neceſſities, thou haſt giuen vs bearing beaſts. To refreſh vs withall, thou haſt beſtowed vpon vs the fowles of the aire, and the fiſhes of the ſea, and the fruits of the earth. For euerie ſore, maladie and diſeaſe of ours, thou haſt created medicine, ſalue, and plaiſter out of the earth. And for euerie ſeuerall euill, thou haſt prepared a ſeuerall remedie to encounter it; becauſe thou art mercifull, and full of compaſſion, and thou our potter knoweſt of what mettall we be made, and how that all of vs are claie in thy hand.
                        O holie Lord God, our good maker, by theſe leaſt things we comprehend the great things: and by theſe viſible things we comprehend thine inuiſible things. For if thou ſend ſo great and ſo innumerable benefits vnto me for this baſe and corruptible bodie of mine, from the ſkie, and the aire; from the land and the ſea; from light and darkeneſſe; from heate and ſhadowe; from dew and raine; from wind and ſhowers; from fowles and fiſhes; from beaſts and trees; by diuerſitie

of herbes and things that growe vpon the earth, and by the ſeruice of all thy creatures ſeruing our turnes by courſe in their ſeaſons, to eaſe vs of our wearineſſe: how excellent I praie thee, and how great & innumerable ſhall thoſe good things be, which thou haſt prepared for them that loue thee, in that heauenlie Realme, where we ſhall ſee thee face to face? If thou doo ſo much for vs in priſon, what wilt thou doo in thy pallace? Great and innumerable are thy works, O Lord, thou King of heauen and earth. For ſith that all theſe things be exceeding good & pleaſant, which thou haſt deliuered to good men & bad men togither in common; what maner of things ſhall thoſe be, which thou haſt laid vp in ſtore for good men onlie? If the gifts be ſo ſundrie and ſo innumerable, which thou dealeſt now as well to thy foes as thy friends; how great & innumerable, how ſweet & delightfull ſhall thoſe be, which thou wilt deale onlie to thy friends? If thou giue ſo great ſolace in this time of mourning, how great ioies wilt thou giue in the daie of wedding? If our priſon conteine ſo manie delectable things, how much more delectable things conteineth our fathers houſe? O God, no eie without thee hath ſeene the things that thou haſt prepared for them that loue thee. For according to the manifoldneſſe of thy mightie works, ſo alſo is the great aboundance of thy ſweetneſſe, which thou keepeſt in ſtore for them that loue thee. For great art thou O Lord our God, yea vnmeaſurable art thou, and there is no end of thy greatneſſe, nor number of thy wiſedome, nor meaſure of thy mercie: neither is there end, number, or meaſure of thy bountifulneſſe. But like as thou thy ſelfe art great, ſo are thy rewards great: for thou thy ſelfe art both the price, and the reward of all thy lawfull combators. To thee therefore be all honour, glorie, and praiſe for euer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        
                        A meditation of Gods power, beautie, and goodneſſe.
                        
                        
                           BIcauſe thou, Lord, wouldeſt haue vs to loue thee, not one lie dooſt thou will, intiſe, allure, and prouoke vs; but alſo dooſt command vs ſo to doo: promiſing thy ſelfe vnto ſuch as loue thee, and threatening vs with dainnation if we doo otherwiſe. Whereby we may ſee both our great corruption and naughtineſſe, and alſo thine exceeding great mercie toward vs.
                        Firſt concerning our corruption and naughtineſſe, what a thing is it that power, riches, authoritie, beutie, goodneſſe, liberalitie, truth, iuſtice (which all thou art good Lord) can not mooue vs to loue thee? Whatſoeuer things we ſee faire, good, wiſe, mightie, are but euen ſparks of thy power, beautie, goodneſſe, wiſdome, which thou art. For to the end thou mighteſt declare thy riches, beautie, power, wiſdome, goodnes, &c. Thou haſt not onelie made, but ſtill dooeſt conſerue all creatures to be (as Dauid ſaith of the heauens) declarers and ſetters foorth of thy glorie, and as a booke to teach vs to knowe thee.
                        How faire thou art, the beautie of the ſunne, moone, ſtars, light, flowers, riuers, feelds, hils, biros, beaſts, men, and all creatures; yea, the goodlie ſcape & forme of the whole world dooth declare.
                        How mightie thou art, we are! taught by the creation of the world euen of naught; by gouerning the ſame, by puniſhing the wicked mightie Giants thereof; by ouerthrowing their deuiſes; by repreſſing the rages of the ſea, and keeping it within hir bounds; by ſtormes, by tempeſts, by fires. Theſe and ſuch like declare vnto vs thine inuiſible, almightie, and terrible

power, whereby thou ſubdueſt all things vnto thee.
                        How rich thou art, this world, thy great and infinite treaſure-houſe, dooth well declare. What plentie is there, not onelie of things, but alſo of euerie kind of things? Yea, how dooſt thou yeerelie and dailie multiplie theſe kinds? How manie ſeeds dooſt thou make of one ſeed? Yea, what a great increaſe dooſt thou bring it vnto? Theſe can not but put vs in remembrance of the exceeding riches that thou haſt. For if to thine enimies, which loue thee not (as the moſt part of this world be,) if to them thou giueſt ſo plentifullie thy riches heere: what ſhall we thinke, that with thy ſelfe thou haſt laid vp for thy freends?
                        How good thou art, all creatures generallie and particularlie do teach. What creature is there in the world, which thou haſt not made for our commoditie? I will not ſaie how that thou mighteſt haue made vs creaturs without ſenſe or reaſon, if thou hadſt would. But amongſt all things none dooth ſo teach vs thy great loue towards vs, as dooth the death of thy moſt deerlie beloued ſonne, who ſuffered the paines and terrors thereof: yea, and of hell it ſelfe for our ſakes. If this thy loue had beene but a ſmall thing, it would neuer haue laſted ſo long, nor Chriſt would neuer haue died.
                     
                     
                        
                           Praiers and meditations to be vſed in the foure ſeaſons of the yeere, and first: In the Spring-time.
                           
                              ALmightie renewer of all things, Lord Ieſu, which haſt made this moſt goodlie world for our ſakes; which haſt garniſhed the heauens with ſo manie lights, vnto the vſe of the daie and the night; which tempereſt the earth with ſundrie times and ſeaſons, ordeined by thee

to be the nouriſher of man and beaſts: and now (thou being reſtored to life) all things renew and confirme to vs the hope of reſurrection promiſed by thee. The medowes afore being withered, waxe greene againe with new graſſe: the herbs are garniſhed with diuers gems of flowers: the corne herbeth: ſeeds buried in holes ſhoote foorth: trees being dead afore, waxe yoong againe with new boughes; and being goodlie decked with new bloſſoms, giue vs hope of fruit. The ſunne it ſelfe increaſeth the grace of his light: brieflie, the whole face of nature ſpringing againe, whitherſoeuer we turne our eies, dooth ſpeake out, and preach thy goodneſſe towards mankind, wherethrough with ſundrie ſolaces thou dooeſt eaſe and mitigate to vs, being through our fault driuen out of Paradiſe, our deſerued exile. Grant, I ſaie, O good God, that we which being borne againe through baptiſme, haue put off the old man, made now a new creature, neuer ſlide againe to old age; but that we may be euer greene with perpetuall innocencie, by the pleaſant breathing on of thy ſpirit, that we may be adorned dailie more and more with the flowers of vertues, proceeding to fruit woorthie of that Goſpell, which with the Father, and the holie Ghoſt reigne through all worlds,
                           Amen.
                        
                        
                           In the Summer.
                           
                              MOſt wiſe Gouernor, and Ruler of all things Ieſu Chriſt; behold, the yeere obeieng thy commandments waxeth hot with the feruour of the ſunne, preparing ripe fruits vnto the vſe of thy ſeruants: humblie we beſeech thee, which art our true Sunne, without whom nothing is bright in our ſoules, neither bringeth foorth anie fruit; ſtretch the beames of thy grace into the earth of

our ſpirits, that daily they may waxe hot more & more with the fire of thy gratious loue, and that they may bring foorth ſundrie fruits of wholeſome good works. For thou haſt witneſſed in thy holie Goſpell, that thou art ſingularlie delighted with this meate and drinke. This is the raine that thy feruent loue thirſted for, this is alſo the meate that the holie Apoſtle Paule hungered for, euen before he vnderſtood and did knowe what it meant. Thou cameſt into the world, to ſend fire among vs: neither diddeſt thou deſire anie thing more, than that it ſhould be kindeled; except our hart be touched with the beames of thy grace. Increaſe, Lord Ieſu that, that thou haſt giuen; finiſh that, that thou haſt begun: vntill we growe to perfect men, vnto the meaſure of thy fulneſſe. Thou haſt put off mortalitie, but thou haſt not put off loue towards vs; but euen now fulfilleſt the office of a mightie and friendlie Aduocate for vs with God the Father, to whom equall in power and authoritie thou reigneſt with the holie Ghoſt,
                           Amen.
                        
                        
                           In Harueſt.
                           
                              WE giue thanks vnto thee moſt mercifull Father, maker of heauen and earth, that by thy good prouidence the yeere is waxen ripe, powring out vnto vs plentious abundance of victuals: grant, we humblie beſeech thee, that as thy bountiouſnes miniſtreth ſundrie and rich abundance of fruits, to the ſuſteining & nouriſhment of our bodies: ſo by the grace of thy ſpirit, without which there is no good thing brought foorth, is nouriſhed, or liueth; let the affection of godlineſſe waxe ripe, and be made vp in our minds, that abiding in the faith of thine onelie begotten Sonne, through all our life, wee

may be fruitfull in good works, and alſo receiue a plentifull harueſt in the reſurrection of the iuſt, by the ſame our Lord Ieſu Chriſt, which liueth and reigneth with thee in the companie of the holie Ghoſt for euer,
                           Amen.
                        
                        
                           In Winter.
                           
                              O God, the moſt wiſe maker and gouernor of the world, at whoſe commandement by time appointed, courſe is changed and turned into it ſelfe by the ſame: behold as it were the old age and death of the yeere. Winter is come, whoſe ſadneſſe and incommodities be more eaſie vnto vs, bicauſe of the pleſantnes of the Spring time, which ſhall ſhortlie ſucceed. According to the enſample of the yeere, our inward man flouriſheth in his childhood; is feruent in youth; waxeth ripe in mans age; falleth awaie and dieth in his old age: but the hope of liuing againe aſſwageth the houre of death, which is ſure vnto vs, euen for this cauſe, that thy ſonne hath promiſed it, which is the euerlaſting truth, which alſo can no more be deceiued or deceiue, than hee can ceaſe to be thy ſonne. Through this thy ſonne, our inward man knoweth no old age or death: but by his gift it euer flouriſheth with innocencie; it is euer feruent in the ſtudie of godlineſſe; it euer bringeth foorth fruit, and powreth out that, that ſhe hath receiued, vpon other: and as much as the bodies courage faileth, ſo much more the ſpirit flouriſheth. We beſeech thee, that thou wilt maintaine and increaſe thoſe things, which thou haſt vouchſafed to giue vs, through thine onelie begotten ſonne, which liueth and reigneth with thee for euermore,
                           Amen.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                        Another praier to be ſaid at all times and ſeaſons of the yeere.
                        
                        
                           O Euerlaſting GOD, Creator of all things, in whoſe hands lieth the diſpoſition of all times and ſeaſons: qualifie we beſeech thee, the inclinations of thy creatures, heauen and earth, with ſuch naturall and kindlie moderation, as may moſt ſerue to the commoditie, health, and welfare of all mankind; that we may receiue the fruits of the earth to our comfortable ſuſtentation, dulie honoring and praiſing thy holie name therefore. Mortifie within vs the old roots of our natiue iniquitie, killing them as it were with the winter of a cold luſt to enſue them. Sowe the ſeeds of thy grace within vs, that wee may ſpring vp in all godlineſſe. Send vs the feruencie of thy ſpirit, that we may ſhew foorth the ripe fruits of a liuelie faith: that when it ſhall be thy good pleaſure to appoint thy final harueſt, thou wilt vouchſafe to bring vs into thy wiſhed barne, like good and clenſed corne, that is to ſaie, into thine euerlaſting kingdome, there to reſt with thy choſen, Abraham, Iſaac, and Iacob, in all eternitie, So be it.

                        Of the incomprehenſible praiſe due vnto God for all his works and benefits.
                        
                        
                           HOW ſhall I do, O Lord? Whence ſhall I haue praiſe to praiſe thee withall? For like as thou madeſt me without mine aduiſe, as it liked thy ſelfe beſt; ſo haſt thou praiſe without me, as it liketh thee. Thou thy ſelfe Lord art thiue owne praiſe. All thy works & creatures both in heauen

and earth praiſe thee according to thy manifold greatneſſe. Thy praiſe, O Lord, is incomprehenſible: no hart can comprehend it, no tong can meaſure it, no eare can receiue it: for theſe things paſſe awaie, but thy praiſe O Lord, continueth for euer. Thoughts haue a beginning, and thoughts haue an end: voices make a ſound, and foorthwith paſſe awaie: the eare heareth, and the hearing ceaſſeth: but thy praiſe ſtandeth faſt for euer. Who is he then that can praiſe thee? What man is able to vtter foorth thy praiſes? Thy praiſe is euerlaſting, and not tranſitorie. That man praiſeth thee, which beleeueth thee to be thine owne praiſe. The man praiſeth thee, which acknowledgeth himſelfe vnable to attaine to thy praiſe.
                        O praiſe perpetuall, which neuer fadeſt: in thee is our praiſe, in thee ſhall my ſoule be praiſed. It is not we that praiſe thee, but it is thou thy ſelfe that dooeſt it both thy ſelfe, and in thy ſelfe; and we alſo haue praiſe in thee. Then haue we true praiſe, when we haue praiſe of thee, when light alloweth light: for thou beeing the true praiſe, yeeldeſt vs true praiſe. And looke how often we ſeeke for praiſe at anie other bodies hand than thine, ſo often doo we forgo thy praiſe; becauſe the other is ſhadowiſh, but thine is euerlaſting. If we hunt after the tranſitorie praiſe, we looſe the eternall praiſe.
                        O praiſe eternall, O my Lord God, of whome is all praiſe, without whome there is no praiſe; I am not able to praiſe thee without thee. Let me haue thee, and I will praiſe thee. For what am I of my ſelfe, Lord, that I ſhould praiſe thee? I am but duſt and aſhes, I am but a dead and ſtinking dog, I am but woormes and rottenneſſe. I! what am I to praiſe thee, O moſt mightie Lord God? How can the breath of no better than fleſh praiſe thee, which dwelleſt in euerlaſtingneſſe? Can darkeneſſe praiſe light, or death life? Thou

art light, I darkeneſſe: thou life, I death. Can lieng praiſe truth? Thou art truth, and I am a woman no better than vanitie it ſelf. How ſhall I then praiſe thee O Lord? Shall my wretchedneſſe praiſe thee? Shall ſtinch praiſe ſweet ſents? Shall mans mortalitie, which is heere to daie, and gone to morrowe, praiſe thee? Shall man which is but rottenneſſe, or the ſonne of man which is but woormes, praiſe thee? O Lord, can he praiſe thee, which is bred, borne, and brought vp in ſinfulneſſe? Praiſe is not ſeemelie in the mouth of a ſinner.
                        O Lord my God, let thine owne incomprehenſible power, let thy vnbounded wiſedome, let thine vnſpeakable goodneſſe, let thine ouerpaſſing mercie, let thy ſuperabundant pitie, and let thine euerlaſting vertue and Godhead praiſe thee. Praiſed be thou by thine owne almightie puiſſance, and alſo by thy ſingular gratious goodneſſe and louingneſſe, whereby thou haſt created vs, O Lord, the life of my ſoule.
                     
                     
                        Of Gods manifold benefits generallie, with an humble thanks-giuing vnto his Maiestie for the ſame.
                        
                           AND I thy handmaid, whome thorough thy goodneſſe thou haſt created, will to the vttermoſt of my power, praiſe thee my God, my creator, my preſeruer, and my deliuerer, with all my hart; and call to mind all the good that thou haſt done me from my youth vp, to this inſtant. For I knowe that vnthankefulneſſe doth greatlie diſpleaſe thee, which is the roote of all ſpirituall euill, and a wind that blaſteth and burneth vp all good, damming vp the fountaine of thy godlie mercie for euer. Through it, the works that be dead alreadie, reuiue

not: and the works that be aliue, doo die out of hand, and recouer not againe. But I thy creature will giue thanks to thee, O Lord, leaſt I be vnthankefull to thee my deliuerer, for the deliuering of me.
                        How often had that dragon ſwallowed me vp long ago, but that thou, O Lord, hadſt plucked me out of his mouth? How often haue I ſinned, & he ſtood readie to ſnatch me vp, but that thou didſt defend me O Lord my God? When I dealt wickedlie, and when I brake thy commandements, he ſtood waiting to carrie me awaie to hell; but thou withſtoodeſt him. I offended thee, and thou didſt defend me. I feared thee not, and yet thou didſt keepe me. I ſtarted awaie from thee, and yeelded my ſelfe to mine enimie, and yet thou didſt fraie him awaie, that he ſhould not take mee.
                        Theſe good turnes haſt thou done for me O Lord my God, & I wretch wiſt it not. For ſo haſt thou often times deliuered me out of the diuels chaps, plucked me out of the lions mouth, and manie and ſundrie waies brought me backe againe from hell, though I wiſt it not. For I haue gone downe to the verie gates of hell, but thou haſt held me from going in. I drew neere to deaths dore, but thou haſt not ſuffered it to take me in. Alſo, thou haſt oftentimes preſerued mée from bodilie death, O my ſauiour, when I haue beene attached with ſore ſickneſſes: and when I haue beene in manie dangers by ſea, and by land, thou haſt alwaies ſtood by me, deliuering me from fire, and from ſword, and from all perill, and mercifullie preſeruing me. Trulie Lord, thou knoweſt, that if death had diſpatched me at that time, hell had receiued my ſoule, and I had beene damned for euer: but thy mercie and thy grace preuented me, reſcuing me from bodilie death, and alſo from the death of my ſoule, O my Lord God. Theſe and manie other good turnes haſt thou done for me I ſaie; and I was blind and wiſt it not,

vntill thou inlightenedſt me.
                        Now therefore, O light of my ſoule, my Lord God, my life whereby I liue; the ſight of mine eies wherewith I ſee; behold thou haſt inlightened me, and I perceiue how I liue through thee. And I yeeld thee thanks though little woorth and ſlender, and farre from thy benefits; howbeit yet ſuch as my frailtie hath to giue. For thou onelie art my God, and my gratious maker, which loueſt our ſoules, and hateſt none of the things that thou haſt made. Behold I am the chiefe among the ſinners whom thou haſt ſaued, that I may be an example vnto others of thy moſt merciful louing kindnes. I will acknowledge thy great benefits vnto thee. For thou haſt plucked me out of the bottome of hell once, and twiſe, and thriſe, and an hundred times, and a thouſand times. Yea, I alwaies made toward hell, and thou didſt alwaies bring me backe againe, when thou mighteſt iuſtlie haue damned me, if thou haddeſt would: but thou wouldeſt not, O Lord my GOD, bicauſe thou loueſt mens ſoules, and beareſt with mens ſinnes, that they might repent: all thy waies be full of mercie.
                        Now therefore, O Lord my God, I ſee theſe things, and diſcerne them by thy light; and my hart is aſtoniſhed at thy great mercie towards me, in that thou haſt deliuered my ſoule from the bottome of hell, and brought me backe againe to life. For I was ſtarke dead, and thou haſt made me thoroughlie aliue againe. Therfore am I altogither beholden to thee for my life. And whole as I am, I yeeld my ſelfe wholie vnto thee. Let my whole ſpirit, my whole hart, my whole bodie, and my whole life, liue vnto thee my ſweet life. For thou haſt deliuered me whole, that thou mighteſt poſſeſſe me whole; thou haſt made me whole new againe, that thou mighteſt haue me whole againe.
                        And therefore let me loue thee, O Lord my ſtrength;

let me loue thee, O mine vnſpeakable ioie, and let mee liue hencefoorth, not to my ſelfe, but vnto thee. All my whole life, which was periſhed in mine owne wretchedneſſe, is reuiued againe in thy mercie. For thou art a pitifull and mercifull GOD, and manie are thy compaſſions towards thouſands, in them that loue thy name. And therfore, O Lord my God, thou my ſanctifier haſt commanded me in thy lawe, that I ſhould loue thee with all my hart, with all my might, yea euen from the bottome of my hart, at all houres and times, wherein I enioie the benefits of thy mercie. For I ſhould periſh for euer, but that thou ruleſt me euer. I ſhould euer die, but that thou euer quickeneſt me: yea, euerie moment thou bindeſt me vnto thee, in as much as euerie moment thou beſtoweſt thy great benefits vpon me. Therfore like as there is no houre or inſtant of time in all my life, that I haue not the vſe of thy benefits: ſo ought there to be no moment, wherein I ſhould not haue thee in remembrance before mine eies, and loue thee to the vttermoſt of my power. But this I am not able to doo, except thou make me able; of whom commeth euerie good gift and excellent gift; in whom there is no change, nor intercourſe of darknes. For to loue thee commeth not of our owne will, or of our owne running; but of thy mercie. Lord, it is thy gift, whoſe all good things are. Thou commandeſt vs to loue thee; giue vs that which thou commandeſt, and command what thou wilt.
                     
                     
                        Another meditation of Gods great benefits.
                        
                        
                           VNto thee, O ſouereigne light, O ghoſtlie Phyſician, & the health of my ſoule, will I now & euer giue praiſe, with all my whole hart, for all thy benefits, wherwith thou feedeſt me from my youth vnto mine old

age, and euen till my laſt gaſpe, I beſeech thee by thy ſelfe forſake me not. For thou madeſt me when I was not; thou redeemedſt me when I was forlorne; thou inlightenedſt me when I was in darkneſſe; thou raiſedſt me when I was dead: yea, when I was both forlorne and dead, thou cameſt downe from the boſome of thy Father, to me, & tookeſt mortalitie vpon thee. Thou being my King, cameſt downe to thy ſeruant. To redeeme thy ſeruant, thou gaueſt thy ſelfe: to the intent that I might liue; thou tookeſt vpon thee to die, and ouercameſt death. Thou diddeſt ſet me vp againe, by abaſing thy ſelfe lowe. I was vndoone; I was gone farre awaie in my ſinnes; I was ſold to ſinne: then cameſt thou for me to bring me out againe; and thou didſt loue me ſo well, that thou gaueſt thine owne blood for my ranſome.
                        Lord, thou haſt loued me more than thy ſelfe. For thou diddeſt find in thine hart to die for me. Upon this condition haſt thou with ſo deere a price brought mee backe againe from baniſhment; ranſomed me out of bondage; reſcued me from puniſhment; called mee by thine owne name, and ſealed me with thy blood; that the remembrance of thee ſhould be euermore with me, and that he ſhould neuer depart from my hart, who for my ſake ſhunned not the croſſe. Thou haſt annointed me with the oile, wherewith thou thy ſelfe wert annointed, that I might be called a Chriſtian, after thy name Chriſt. Behold, thou haſt regiſtred me vpon thine hands, to the end that the remembrance of mee might be alwaies preſent with thee: yet notwithſtanding, ſo as if the remembrance of thee, be alwaies preſent with me.
                        Thus then haue thy loue, thy grace and mercie alwaies preuented me. For thou haſt oftentimes deliuered me from manie and great perils, O my deliuerer. When I went aſtraie, thou broughteſt mee backe

againe; when I was ignorant, thou taughteſt mee; when I ſinned, thou diddeſt chaſtiſe me; when I haue beene in heauines, thou haſt cheered me; when I haue beene in deſpaire, thou haſt recomforted me; when I haue beene fallen, thou haſt lifted me vp; when I haue ſtood, thou haſt vpholden me; when I haue gone, thou haſt guided me; when I haue come, thou haſt receiued me; when I haue ſlept, thou haſt watched me; and when I haue cried vnto thee, thou haſt heard me.
                        O Lord, where ſhall I haue words to vtter the ſignes of thy ſingular loue toward me; conſidering thine innumerable benefits wherin thou haſt brought me vp from the beginning? Namelie, euen from the benefit of the creation, when at the firſt beginning thou madeſt me of nothing after thine owne image, in honouring and aduancing me among the creatures, which thou madeſt, and innobling me with the light of thy countenance, which thou imprintedſt vpon the lampe of my hart, thereby diſſeuering me as well from ſenſible, as from ſenſeleſſe creatures, and abaſing mee but little beneath the Angels. And yet was all this but a ſmall matter in the ſight of thy Godhead. For without ceaſſng thou haſt dailie nouriſhed this vnprofitable woorme, which ſtinketh with ſinne, with all the ſingular and exceeding great ſtore of thy good gifts and benefits: and thou haſt as it were ſuckled and ſtrengthened me thy little tender babe, with the teates of thy comfort. For to the intent that I ſhould wholie ſerue thee, thou haſt appointed all thy creatures to ſerue me.
                        Theſe and manie other good turnes, haſt thou done vnto me, O Lord my God, the life of my ſoule: for all which I render vnto thee againe moſt humble and hartie thanks-giuing: beſeeching thee, O Lord, that it may be a pleaſure to me, wretch that I am, to be alwaies talking of them, alwaies thinking vpon them,

and alwaies giuing thee thanks for them. O my God, ſhew me, I ſaie, how much I am bound to loue thee; make it appeare to me how much I ought to pleaſe thee. Open me the doore of thy light, that I may enter in, and both knowe, & acknowledge vnto thee with my whole hart, that thy mercie is great toward mee, and that thou haſt deliuered my hart from the bottome of hell: ſo as I might euer praiſe thee for all thy good gifts, and loue thee with all my hart, and with all my ſoule, and with all my mind, and with all my ſtrength, yea and that with the verie bowels and intrailes of my hart, and of all my ſinewes. O Lord my God, the bleſſed ſweetneſſe of all that delight in thee: whoſe name is woonderfull, and praiſe woorthie through heauen and earth: So be it.
                        
                     
                     
                        Another forme of thanks-giuing vnto God, for all his benefits, and praier for grace to confirme and increaſe the ſame.
                        
                           O Moſt higheſt, almightie and eternall God, whoſe glorie repleniſheth heauen and earth. If thy holie and celeſtiall powers doo neuer ceaſe in lauding thy moſt holie Maieſtie; how ſhould we ceaſe, earthlie and lowlie ſeruants, which are redeemed with the pretious bloud of thy onelie ſonne? And for as much as thy louing kindneſſe and fauour in eſpeciallie worketh towards vs, we alſo ought continuallie to giue thanks for thy great goodneſſe; but haue mercie, O mercifull father. For the neceſſitie of this life, dooth not ſuffer vs to thanke thee continuallie. Wherefore (though not continuallie as I ought) I worſhip thee my maker with trembling & feare; I giue thee thanks for all thy benefits: that when I was nothing, thou madeſt mee, gaueſt me a liuing

ſoule, quickened with thy holie ſpirit, formed mee with thine owne image, that it might be able to receiue thee, which art the high God. By thy prouidence thou haſt brought me to thoſe things that are expedient for me, giuen to me knowledge and true faith in thee, and planted a godlie mind in me, and inſtructed me in the myſteries of thy holie word & Sacraments.
                        But oh Lord, how dare I recite thy benefits by number; ſeeing thy louing kindneſſe is an vnſearchable bottomleſſe ſea, and an innumerable? For I can not ſo ſoone giue thanks for thy benefits ſhewed of old, as new haue euen ouerwhelmed me. Oh Lord, how great a benefit is this, that I may to thee giue thanks? For what fellowſhip hath vnrighteouſneſſe with righteouſneſſe? What partaking darkeneſſe with light? What agreement filthineſſe with puritie? Follie with wiſedome? Mortalitie, with thee that art immortall? Oh my vileneſſe! Oh thy goodneſſe! Yea, though the ſpirit were readie, yet is the fleſh fraile: but thou O Lord, if thou wilt, canſt make me ſtrong. And ſo, O moſt mercifull father, vouchſafe that I may euer giue thanks and laud to thee. For what good gift did I euer deſire of thee, but thou firſt willedſt it to me? Who better knoweth what is good for me, than thou? And becauſe I need a mediator, accept thine innocent Sonne Ieſus Chriſt, with his croſſe and paſſion, bloud-ſhed, death, and reſurrection for me. I haue not this deſerued: but thou father, of thy mercie and truth haſt by the ſame thy deerelie beloued Sonne, promiſed and giuen vs thy mercie and fauour. Open therefore, O my mercifull Father, for this thy deerelie beloued Sonnes ſake, euen this daie thy woonted hand of mercie, and fulfill my mind and hart with a good will, and let thy right hand defend me. And if my ſinnes, which I acknowledge to be great and innumerable, (therefore I repent and am hartilie ſorie) doo let thy goodneſſe,

O father wipe them awaie; for this is thy glorie, to forgiue ſinnes, and therefore no fleſh may reioice before thee: for thou Lord onlie art pure, and without ſinne. Haue mercie vpon me thy bondſeruant, and vppon all people; and O father, bring them vnto the knowledge of thee that art onlie God, and of Ieſus Chriſt whome thou haſt ſent, the onlie ſauiour and redeemer, mediator, and aduocate for vs: and after this preſent life, bring vs to eternall bliſſe and felicitie, by the deere merits of thy Sonne Ieſus Chriſt. For thine is the power, kingdome, and glorie, for euer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another to the ſame effect.
                        
                           HOnour and praiſe be giuen to thee, O Lord God almightie, moſt deere father of heauen, for all thy mercies and louing kindneſſe ſhewed vnto vs, in that it hath pleaſed thy gratious goodneſſe freelie, of thine owne accord, to elect and chooſe vs to ſaluation afore the beginning of the world: and euen like continuall thanks be giuen vnto thee, for creating vs after thine owne image, for redeeming vs with the pretious bloud of thy deere Sonne, when we were vtterlie loſt; for ſanctifieng vs with thy holie ſpirit, in the reuelation and knowledge of thy ſacred word; for helping and ſuccouring vs in all our need and neceſſitie; for ſauing vs from all dangers of bodie and ſoule; for comforting vs ſo fatherlie in all our troubles and afflictions; for ſparing vs ſo long, and giuing vs ſo large time of repentance. Theſe benefits, O moſt mercifull father, like as we acknowledge to haue receiued of thine onlie goodneſſe, euen ſo we beſeech thee, for thy deere ſonne Ieſus Chriſtes ſake, to grant vs alwaie thy holie ſpirit, whereby we may continuallie growe in thankefulneſſe towards thee, be led into

all truth, and comforted in all aduerſitie. Strengthen our faith, O Lord, kindle it more and more in feruentneſſe and loue towards thee, and our neighbours for thy ſake. Suffer vs not, moſt deere father, to receiue thy word anie more in vaine; but grant vs alwaie the aſſiſtance of thy grace and holie ſpirit, that in hart, word, and deede, we may ſanctifie, and doo woorſhip to thy holie name, that we may help to amplifie thy kingdome, and that whatſoeuer thou ſendeſt, we may bee hartilie well content with thy good will and pleaſure. Suffer vs not to lacke the thing, O father, without the which we can not ſerue thee; but bleſſe thou ſo all the works of our hands, that we may haue ſufficient, and not to be chargeable, but rather helpfull vnto others. Be merciful, O Lord, vnto our offences, and ſeeing our debt is great, which thou haſt forgiuen vs in Ieſus Chriſt, make vs to loue thee, and our neighbors ſo much the more. Be thou, O father, our Captaine and defender in all temptations. Hold thou vs by thy mercifull hand, that we thereby may be deliuered from all inconuenience, and end our liues in the ſanctifieng and honouring of thy holie name, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord,
                        Amen.

                           For lo, when the moſt mightie men gathered their power againſt vs, and laie in wait for our life, they conſpired togither to worke our deſtruction, as though the Lord had determined the ſame; and exhorted one another, ſaieng, God hath forſaken them, therefore perſecute them now flieng awaie, and take them being deſtitute of all helpe.

moſt diligentlie for vs, yea multitudes of the cruell enimies did not ceaſſe craftilie to enuiron and beſet vs round about, and ran vpon vs with gaping mouthes, like raging and roring lions, of malicious minds to bring vs to extremitie, and to deuoure vs.
                        
                        
                           Daugh.
                           For thy ſake O Lord alone were we killed euerie daie, neither were we in anie better condition, than ſheepe appointed of butchers to the ſlaughter.
                        
                        
                           Moth.
                           Manie of vs wandered in the waſte wilderneſſe, and ſought ſtrange cities commodious to dwell in, halfe dead, and killed with famine and thirſt, ouerwhelmed with the ſhadowe of death, and being caſt downe by the burthen of our miſeries, laie downe flat cleauing to the earth.
                        
                        
                           Daugh.
                           The bands of death compaſſed vs round about, and bound vs: moſt wicked men like moſt raging flouds made vs afraid, enuironing vs round about.
                        
                        
                           Moth.
                           We were ſnared, and caſt faſt bound with chaines into moſt darke dungeons: yea we taſted the heate of the fire, and the force of the water.
                        
                        
                           Daugh.
                           Then we called vpon the Lord in theſe extremities. We called vpon the Lord, I ſaie, and he heard our voice out of his high palace, and receiuing into his eares the crie that we made vnto him, he deliuered vs from our miſeries and diſtreſſe.
                        
                        
                           Moth.
                           He gathered vs home which were ſcattered, from the Eaſt & the Weſt, from the North & South, and brought vs from the dungeons of the priſons, and darkeneſſe of death, breaking the fetters and giues of iron in peeces.
                        
                        
                           Daugh.
                           The Lord hath deliuered our life from death: he ſtaid the teares of our eies, and eſtabliſhed our feet, that they did not fall: he hath brought vs out of our diſtreſſe. Hence haue we our light, whereby he cauſeth vs to ſhine, and hath driuen awaie our darkeneſſe.
                        
                        
                           
                           Moth.
                           Therfore will we praiſe thee, O Lord, among the nations, and will ſing lauds vnto thy Maieſtie: yea, we will declare thy power, and will ſhew foorth thy praiſe and mercie earlie in the morning; becauſe thou haſt defended vs, and waſt our refuge in extreme dangers.
                        
                        
                           Daugh.
                           Oh acknowledge, and declare ye openlie, that the Lord is good: for his bountious goodneſſe is for euer. Let all the ſincere worſhippers of the Lord now confeſſe, that his louing kindneſſe is perpetuall. Praiſe ye the Lord.

                              O Lord GOD, moſt mercifull father, who as vpon this daie placing thy ſeruant our moſt deer Souereigne, and moſt gratious Queene Elizabeth, in the Empire of this kingdome, diddeſt deliuer thy people of England from danger of war and oppreſſion, both of bodies by tyrannie, & of conſcience by ſuperſtition, reſtoring peace, and true religion, with libertie both of bodies and minds, and haſt continued the ſame thy bleſſings, without all deſert on our part, now by the ſpace of theſe foure and twentie yeeres. We, who are in memorie of theſe thy great benefits, aſſembled here togither, moſt humblie beſeech thy fatherlie goodneſſe, to grant vs grace, that we may in word, deed and hart, ſhew our ſelues thankfull and obedient vnto thee for the ſame; and that Elizabeth our vertuous Queene, through thy grace, may in all honour, goodneſſe, and godlineſſe, long and manie yeeres liue and reigne ouer vs, and we obeie and enioie hir Maieſtie, with the continuance of thy great

                           Amen.
                        
                     
                     
                        Or elſe ſaie thus:
                        
                           WE yeeld vnto thee, moſt mightie and mercifull father, immortall thanks, for that it hath pleaſed thee of thy meere mercie and fatherlie bountie, after the ſtormes of ſo manie troubleſome times, to conduct vs as vpon this daie out of baniſhment and exile, into the comfortable port of tranquillitie, by the hand of thy moſt gratious ſeruant and our deere Souereigne Ladie Queene Elizabeth. When we were as ſheepe wandering aſtraie in the wilderneſſe, thou ordeinedſt hir Maieſtie to bee our ſhepheard, to gather vs againe into thy ſheepefold. When we had beene long toſſed hither & thither with the outrage and cruell furie of tyrannicall perſecution, like a poore weather-beaten barke, that hath beene continuallie tormoiled and toſſed on the perilous ſurges of the outragious and ſwelling ſeas, finding no ſure rode nor harborough wherein to reſt; but continuallie in danger, either to ſinke into the ſands, or to be ouerwhelmed with waues, or violentlie to be daſhed in peeces againſt the maine rocks. Euen then, I ſaie, when we deſpaired vtterlie of ſafegard, ſtanding ſtil in feare of the hazard of euerlaſting confuſion, thou cōmittedſt the helme to be guided by hir Graces wiſedome, who at laſt conducted vs into the hauen of this long deſired peace and tranquillitie.
                        Therefore, whereas thou haſt placed hir in the regal throne to be our Dauid, our Ioſias, our Samuel;

yea to be our ſhepheard and ring-leader in the waie of true holineſſe and ſincere religion. Inſpire hir mind with the manifold bleſſings of thy grace, that ſhe may walke all the daies of hir life in the path of thy commandements, and happilie diſcharge hir dutie in that ſtewardſhip and diſpenſation, which thou haſt committed to hir Maieſties hands. Inflame hir mind more and more with the loue of thy holie Goſpell; that all hir deeds, thoughts, and practiſes may tend to the propagation and planting of thy word, and Chriſtian religion, in theſe hir Maieſties dominions. Incline the motions of hir vertuous diſpoſition, aboue all things to ſeeke thine honour and glorie; to ſowe the ſeeds of the Catholike faith abundantlie in all places; to cut off the brood of ſuperſtition and idolatrie; to conſtitute true preachers of thy word; and ſtabliſh euerie where thine holie Goſpell and true religion.
                        Preſerue hir, moſt mercifull Father (as hitherto thou haſt moſt miraculouſlie done) from the diueliſh deuiſes and practiſes of hir enimies, that ſhe may haue a long and happie reigne among vs, to the aduancement of thy glorie, and ioie and comfort of all vs hir ſubiects. Let hir naturall diſpoſition continue to hir foes terrible; to hir ſubiects amiable; to hir offenders mercifull; to the vertuous bountifull; indifferent to all men, and in all reſpects parciall in no point, neither in cauſes eccleſiaſticall, nor yet in matters concerning politike gouernement. Aſſiſt hir, moſt mercifull Father, with the might of thy heauenlie ſpirit, to quaile the pride of the triple-headed Romiſh Cerberus, to baniſh his beggerlie ceremonies, to abridge the terme of his reigne, and finallie to cut off and preuent the ſeeds that continuallie ſtriue to ſpring vp from abhominable ſuperſtition and idolatrie.
                        Grant hir grace, moſt mercifull Father, to run the remnant of hir race in the right path of thy commandements,

declining neither to the right hand, nor to the left; but ſo vſing all times thy heauenlie word, as the rule and compaſſe to direct hir courſe. Preſerue hir Grace, moſt mercifull Father, in continuall health of bodie, and quietneſſe of mind, that ſhe may be alwaies able to rule the bridle of hir high charge, and to execute right and iuſtice to all ſorts and degrees; to the aduancement of thy glorie, and the vniuerſall commoditie of hir Maieſties ſubiects. And finallie grant, O moſt mercifull Father, that when it ſhall pleaſe thee to end the terme of hir daies in this world, thou wilt make hir partaker of the celeſtiall ioies, which are prepared for them that feare and loue thee, ſince the foundation of the world. Grant this, moſt mercifull Father, for thy deere Sonne our Lord Ieſus Chriſts ſake, to whom with thee, and the holie Ghoſt, three perſons & one God, be all glorie, honour, and praiſe, world without end,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another thanks-giuing and praier vnto God, for the preſeruation of the Queenes Maiestie, and the Realme.
                        
                           ALmightie God, and moſt mercifull Father, which in thy great mercies haſt both giuen vnto vs a peaceable Prince and gratious Queene, and alſo haft hitherto verie often and miraculouſlie ſaued hir from ſundrie great perils and imminent dangers; and by hir mercifull, vnbloudie, and gratious gouernement, haſt preſerued vs and the whole Realme from manifold miſchiefs and dreadfull plagues, wherewith nations round about vs haue beene, and yet be moſt greeuouſlie afflicted: haue mercie vpon them, O Lord; and grant vs grace, we beſeech thee, for theſe thy great benefits, that wee

may be hartilie thankfull and obedient vnto thee, to flie from all things that may offend thee, and prouoke thy wrath and indignation againſt vs, and to order our liues in all things that may pleaſe thee, that thy ſeruant our Souereigne Ladie Queene Elizabeth, and we thy people committed to hir charge, may by thy protection be continuallie preſerued from all treacherous deceits and violences of enimies, and from all other dangers and perils both bodilie and ghoſtlie, and by thy goodneſſe may be maintained in all peace and godlineſſe. Grant this, O mercifull Father, for thy deere ſonnes ſake, our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, to whom with thee, and the holie Ghoſt, be all honour and glorie, for euer and euer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another meditation to be vſed eſpeciallie vpon the 17. daie of Nouember, wherein the godlie English giueth thanks to God, for the Queenes moſt proſperous gouernement hitherto, and praieth for the continuance thereof to Gods glorie.
                        
                           AMongſt other thy benefits great and innumerable (heauenlie father our moſt mercifull Lord and God) by thee of thine exceeding goodneſſe beſtowed vpon the children of men, the ſeruants of thy houſhold, diſperſed vpon the face of the earth: it hath pleaſed thee, that we thy people of England, liuing in theſe daies, ſhould (in abundance, beyond the meaſure of the graces of our brethren, & the proſperous courſe of our fathers,) behold and perceiue thine ineſtimable good will in the amiableneſſe of thy countenance ſhining vpon vs; to whom thou haſt giuen thy choſen handmaiden Elizabeth for ſouereigne Ladie and Gouernour. For whatſoeuer is for the glorie of thy houſe, O Lord, for vs it is, which

are the iſſue and ſlime of the earth, and vnwoorthie to ſtand and looke vp to heauen, made into veſſels after thine image that were not, to be redeemed and borne anew after the ſecond Adam that periſheth not, in the ſprinkling of the bloud of Chriſt, and ſanctification of the ſpirit that were vtterlie loſt, to ſtand faſt in thy hands, ſealed according to thine eternall loue, and written in the booke of life, that dailie runne headlong to our owne deſtruction. As the ſenſe heereof reioiceth the harts of all thoſe, whome thou haſt knit into this fellowſhip of the Saincts, and called into the bleſſed hope of the eternall kingdome; ſo againe, how vngratefull ſhould we be, to whome thou haſt dealt theſe benefits from thy diuine Maieſtie, by the perſon raiſed vp for thine inſtrument thereof towards vs, if we ſhould not in ſpeciall ſort ſhew our ſelues thankefull vnto thee therefore?
                        And if not to liue tearing and eating one the other, like the Giants in the old world, and euerie man to doo what ſeemeth him beſt in his owne eies; as when there was no Iudge in Iſrael. If that princes reigne, and Gouernours giue iudgement, it is thy gift, and then in the woorſt diſpoſition of their thoughts, for the ſinnes of the people, they are redoubted. Thou, O Lord, haſt appointed them, they are ſacred. Thou, O Lord, haſt annointed them, they are feared; thou changeſt their harts, like the ſtreames of waters; they are honoured. Thine owne image & likeneſſe, in guiding Angels and all creatures, is pregnant; and cannot deuaile in them, bearing rule in earth ouer the children of men. What praiſe is due vnto thee from thoſe, vnto whome thou leaueſt not an Anarchie and headleſſe diſſolution? As to the Canibals a monſtrous and miſſhapen gouernement, and fanning with fire, and ſtreaming with bloud, and ſmoking with miſt and darkeneſſe of errour and ignorance. As to the Antichriſtes,

greaſed in the brow with the marke of the image of the great beaſte & whore of Babylon: not a waſte and barbarous perpetuall heathen contrition, as vnto the Tartarian heards of curſed Cham, vnto the ruſtie & waſted with miſerie the inhabitants of Meſchech; or to the turbulent and rauenous ſwarmes and hoſts of Tubal-gog, or ſuch like as thoſe: but contrariwiſe, whome thou leadeſt like a flocke of ſheepe by the hands of Moſes and Aaron, and haſt choſen Dauid thy ſeruant, whome thou haſt loued, to feed as the people of thine owne inheritance, giuing vnto them for warre, peace; for inciuilitie, ſocietie; for ignorance, knowledge; for ſuperſtition, religion; for error, truth; for hunger, plentie; for vnprouidence, policie; for diſſonancie, harmonie; for miſerie, felicitie; and making them to dwell in ſafetie, as vnder the wings of thy defence, and ſhadowe of thy protection.
                        Now, ſuch hath beene thy mercie towards vs, that no tongue is able to expreſſe, in giuing vs in thy gratious pleaſure, and thine vnrecountable largeſſe and liberalitie, thy ſelect ſeruant Elizabeth, Queene, and ſupreame Gouernour to vs, of the legue nations and peoples of hir obeiſance and regiment: that as by a ſtarre, the light and influence ouer things beneath from thee, the firſt cauſe and fountaine of brightneſſe, not to be attained vnto; and as by a cleere riuer and plentifull brooke, the courſe of the waters from thee, the euerlaſting head-ſpring: euen ſo the ſhining beames, and flowing ſtreames of all thoſe thy mercies and good gifts haue beene and are, ſithence the daies of hir happie and gratious gouernement, from thee conuaid and deuolued vnto vs. And we, that before were no people, not ſo much in regard of the eſtate in which we haled, when we were ſauage, and wood men, cruell as men-deuourers, terrible as ſpirits, brutiſh as beaſts in the old age, at the firſt calling home of our

grand anceſtors to humane ciuilitie: but in theſe daies in few yeares degenerate from the true knowledge of thee and thy Sonne Ieſus Chriſt, vnto the conſuming nakedneſſe of idolatrie, and plaieng inordinate before the golden calfe of our owne making and our Prieſts.
                        Now the foure and twentith Sunne moſt happilie inuironeth in the firmament, ſithence by the meanes of a poore veſſell of the weaker ſexe, and a ſillie maiden, thou performing the glorious deliuerance of thy people, out of the thraldome and ſlauerie of Pharao and Egypt, didſt annoint the kings daughter with an holie oile, ſetting a crowne of pure gold vpon hir head, and inueſting hir with the purple, and ſcepter, and regall diademe of the Realme: ſithence which time, O father, we owe to thee and to hir, our God, and our Moſes, the breath of our noſtrels, the ſight of this light, the vſe of this aire, the eaſe of our harts, the peace of our conſciences, and the whole worke of our welfare. By hir inſpired by thee, ſpreading hir beames at hir appearing, the bloudie launces, and claunching murreans, and the redoubling ſheelds haue beene ſhattered aſunder in ſhiuers, and bated, and foiled into mattockes and ſpades, the flames of our furies quenched and put out, and the poole of grace flowed ouer the Realme: the Lion reconciled with the Lambe, the wilde Aſſe ſet to be paſtured with the ſeelie Kid; the abhomination of deſolation remoued from the holie Temple, and the Sonne of man exalted and lift vp on high in his owne kingdome, for all that were ſtoong by the firie Serpent to looke vpon and be ſaued.
                        In admirable lenitie Babylon hath put on Zion; Egypt is become our owne; Rahab the harlot denizoned in Ieruſalem; we become of the wild oliues, the true garden plants; of Iſmael, Iſrael; of miſcreant, chriſtian; of painime, proteſting & profeſſing; of Antichriſtian Romaniſts, & heathen idolaters, faithfull, Euangelicall,

ſincerelie beleeuing, woorſhippers of thee in ſpirit and veritie, according to thy holie word. Neither hath coſt beene ſpared, nor occaſion foreſlowed, nor time ouerpaſſed, nor trauell intermitted, to raiſe that was fallen, to win that was withholden, to call that was ſtraied, to heale that was wearied, to find that was loſt, to reſtore that was ruined, to repaire that was decaied, to make good and enable that was abandoned. Preachers haue beene ſent foorth plentiouſlie, lawes haue beene executed mercifullie, orders haue beene ſet downe politikelie, dangers haue beene declined diſcreetly, tumults haue beene appeaſed victoriouſlie, the whole ſpacious dominions of both Iles, and the adiacent lands gouerned triumphantlie: ſo as it is hard to find the man that more orderlie hath managed the charge of anie one houſhold, than the daughter of thy houſe with hir virginall hands hath weelded the weightie ſcepter of ſundrie and mightie populous nations.
                        In hir time haue been ſeene the golden yeeres of the reigne of hir father Dauid, and the peacefull kingdom of Salomon to haue been aduanced: the earth not to haue denied hir fruitfulneſſe, the ſea hir increaſe, the clouds their drops, the heauens their faireneſſe, the ſunne his warmth, the yeere hir goodneſſe: but the vallies ſtand thicke with corne, the wilderneſſe crowned with gladneſſe, the furrowes watered, the mountaines laugh & ſing, the folds full of ſheepe, our ſonnes and our daughters growe vp like to the poliſhed corners of the Temple, our yoong men ſee viſions, and our old men propheſie, Ieruſalem hir light ſhining vnto hir, & the glorie of the Lord riſen vnto hir, the Queene bringing hir honor vnto the Citie of Dauid, and the nations walking in the light thereof.
                        Great is the honour that thou, O Iehouah, haſt heaped vpon vs; and honourable in foraigne regions

is the worke that thou haſt wrought by thy choſen, yea and ſo much the more hath the brightneſſe of this beautie beene powred abroade, that whileſt Egypt round about hath been darkened, euen the whole world in a manner beſides vs, whome thou haſt gathered into paſtures of this Goſen, and the thicke miſts of errour haue blinded the eies of the earth, the cloudie piller hath not departed from vs by the daie, nor the firie flame by night. Whileſt other lands round about haue warred to the deſtruction of one another, our Moſes hath guided vs in peace. Whileſt other nations like Egypt round about hath been plagued by the deſtroier from the firſt borne, ſitting vpon the princes throne, vnto the vaſſall and ſlaue grinding at the handmill, our Moſes hath not diminiſhed of hir flocke. Whileſt the firme lands haue beene ouerwhelmed by the rage of the ſeas and waters, our Iland hauing dwelt in peace, hath ſent hir ſhip into Ophir for gold, and prepared hir nauie againſt the danger of the enimie. Whileſt Athalia hath murthered hir owne bloud, our Ioas hath learned the lawe of the Lord of Iehoiada. Whileſt Achas conſecrateth his owne ſonne in the fire, and Samaria eateth hir owne children on the walles, our Eliza directeth the children of the Prophets in their offices. Whileſt Iezabel ſetteth vp Baal, and embrueth Achab with the bloud of the Prophets, and of Naboth, our Elias gathereth the people of God to mount Carmel, to behold the wonder of the fire of God, lighting from heauen vpon the ſacrifices, and repleniſhing the harts with ioie, and tongues, with gifts of languages.
                        This is then ſo woorthie an inſtrument of thy goodneſſe, and expreſſe image of thy Maieſtie, & the ample matter of this daies celebritie. And now what doth thy people deſire at thy hands; but that firſt, O Lord, thou giue vs thankefull harts, and make vs all the

daies of our liues mindfull of this thy fatherlie and gratious bountifulneſſe. Then, as preſentlie the Queenes highneſſe hath gloriouſlie atchiued the trauell of full three and twentie yeares, and now the annuall celebritie of our voluntarie ſacrifice of praiſe and thanks-giuing therefore returneth: ſo it may by thy benefit full often returne, and not once or twice, but yeare by yeare, and yeare heaped vpon yeare, we and our of-ſpring may behold this felicitie, vntill we and ſhe ſatiſfied in aboundance, the time drawe along which thou haſt appointed for the veiling of hir crowne, at the feet of thy ſonne Ieſus; and the courſe of this earthlie pilgrimage ouerrun, we and ſhe at our determined ſeaſons be taken to reigne in the euerlaſting kingdome of thy glorie.
                        Againe, where much is the miſchiefe of man, great and enormous the rage of Sathan, ſubtill the practiſes of Antichriſt, euill our deſerts, lamentable the ſtate of things, whileſt open colouring hideth priuie conſpiring, poiſoned lips giue ſugred words, the breath of Cockatrices, the embracings of Scorpions, the roring of Bulles, the ringing of Libels, the raging of Rabſake, the ſword of Herod, the deſtruction of Abbadon hath beene ſeene in our ſtreets, hath beene heard on our walles, hath multiplied before the gates of our Cities, that thou deſtroie vs not in the midſt of the works of thy mercie, to leaue vs headleſſe and hopeleſſe, and make vs a ſcorne and prouerbe to the enimie; but rather to behold the number of the faithfull ſubiects, in the dread of their ſoules, and iuſt gealouſie of their common intereſt, bowing the knees of their harts for the long ſafetie of Queene Elizabeths ſacred princelie perſon, rather than in thy iuſt furie, for auenging of our ſinnes, to ſuffer the diuell with the wicked to preuaile in the vniuſt zealouſneſſe of their prepoſterous vowes, graceleſlie ſwearing the death of thy

Saincts, and thine annointed.
                        Laſtlie, that what remaineth of the happie building of thy Church, by the hands of thy deere daughter, thou plentifullie powre of thy principall ſpirit vpon hir, and rauiſh hir hart with the flame of the loue of thee and thy houſe, with Moſes to leade, and with Ioſhua to bring into the land of promiſe, with Debora to fight the battell; and with Iahel to knocke Siſera of Rome in the temples of his vſurped headſhip, to his vtter deſtruction; with Dauid to bring home the Arke; and with Salomon to finiſh and conſecrate to eternitie thy Temple amongſt the people: on the earth for the time to giue largelie hir foſtermilke to Hieruſalem: in heauen at the time in the pureneſſe of hir virginitie, to be preſented to the lambe, and ſing the ſong of hir wedding daie, with thy Angels & thy Saincts, to the praiſe of thy glorious Maieſtie, the Father, the Sonne, and the holie Ghoſt, in one eternall Deitie, for euer and euer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another godlie and learned praier for our moſt gratious ſouereigne Ladie, Queene Elizabeth.
                        
                           
                              O
                            Almightie, eternall God, creator, gouernor & preſeruer of all things, Lord of all lords, and King of all kings, who madeſt man like vnto thine owne image, that he ſhould honour, ſerue, and obeie thee onlie, and that all other thy creatures ſhould ſerue to his vſe and commoditie, ouer whome thou madeſt him lord and ruler, the forbidden fruit onlie except: but he moſt miſerable man, by his owne diſobedience, in eating thereof, loſt not onlie that kinglie prerogatiue, but brought himſelfe and all his poſteritie into the ſtate of eternall

damnation. Yet thou, O Lord, in thine vnſpeakable mercie, didſt then promiſe, and in time broughteſt to paſſe, that thine onlie Sonne became man like vnto vs, ſin except, and was borne of a pure virgin by thy diuine prouidence and power, who to reſtore this now moſt miſerable man, with all vs, whoſe children by nature we are, vnto the ſtate of eternall ſaluation, did ſuffer moſt ſhamefull, moſt vile and bitter, yea moſt cruell and painefull death on the croſſe, whereon his glorious bodie was broken, and his pretious bloud ſhead, a ſufficient ranſome, a full ſatiſfaction, a iuſt recompenſe of thy iuſtice and lawe, for all them that beleeue, and embrace thy Goſpell and ſacred truth.
                        But O Lord, our good God, be mercifull vnto vs, who by our infirmitie (through the fall of this lordlie man, our great grandfather Adam) can not now liue in anie peaceable or good condition and ſtate, without Magiſtrates and Kings to rule and gouerne vs. We therefore moſt humblie and hartilie beſeech thy diuine Maieſtie, for the loue of thine onlie Sonne Ieſus Chriſt, to looke downe with thy fatherlie compaſſion vpon thy ſeruant Elizabeth, our moſt gratious Queene and dread ſouereigne. Graffe in hir roiall hart, by the working of thy holie ſpirit, thy manifold good gifts and benefits, as wiſdome, grace, perſeuerance in thy truth, increaſe of faith, and affiance in thee. Defend hir, O Lord, with thy mightie hand, and outſtretched arme: graunt vnto hir a moſt honourable, long, and proſperous reigne ouer vs.
                        Moreouer, O Lord, if the ſeruice of golden veſſels in thy Temple at Ieruſalem, were acceptable vnto thee; vouchſafe this thy ſeruant to be eſteemed in thy ſight, as a moſt honourable ornament in the new Ieruſalem, not built with monie by the labour of the ſeruants of the firſt Salomon; but bought with the pretious bloud of the ſecond Salomon, thy Sonne our

Sauiour. Behold hir, and make hir to be, O Lord, as the pretious ſtone or ſignet of thine owne hand, as the apple of thine eie, as the white lillie and ſweet roſe of the incloſed garden, and as the deere doue of thy delights, for thy truth ſake: to the enimies whereof, make hir name moſt dreadfull; and to the Church whereſoeuer diſperſed, moſt acceptable and ioifull. Confound and put to ſhame, O Lord, all thoſe that with or procure anie euill to hir roiall perſon and heroicall virginitie, or diminution of hir kingdomes, and imperiall dignitie ouer them.
                        And when for the multitude of our ſinnes, O Lord, thou wilt puniſh vs with the wind of thy diſpleaſure, by taking from vs this our fragrant and ſweet ſmelling flower, which we beſeech thee for thine own name ſake long to defer: then, O Lord, plant hir in the garden and paradiſe of thy preſence, where ſhe may growe and dwell in felicitie incomparable, which the eie hath not ſeene, the eare hath not heard, neither euer came it into the vnderſtanding of man, thoſe ioies which thou haſt prepared for hir, and all thine elect.
                        Moreouer, O Lord, grant thy heauenlie wiſedome and grace vnto all vs hir ſubiects, that we may aduiſedlie conſider, and dutifullie call to our remembrance, the manifold bleſſings that we ſo long time haue enioied, and doo preſentlie poſſeſſe through thy mercie, by hir miniſterie, authoritie, and the execution of hir kinglie office, vnder the which we doo not onlie reape, and peaceablie enioie the fruits of our labours, and other corporall commodities, but alſo (that which is more woorth than all this) euen the freedome and libertie of conſcience, the preaching and hearing of thy moſt holie word, and the adminiſtration and receiuing of thy holie Sacraments. For all which, and manie other thy bleſſings, O Lord, worke in vs thy grace, to yeeld vnto thy diuine Maieſtie all poſſible and continuall

praiſes and thankſgiuing, that it be not ſaid vnto vs, Are there not ten cleanſed? or, Is not England preſerued from all tyrannie, & enioie all theſe benefits? But where are now their returning to giue thanks? Quicken our memories therefore, O Lord, that we neuer be forgetfull of thy great goodneſſe towards vs, and make vs more and more, for thy ſake reuerentlie to feare hir, dutifullie to obeie hir, and faithfullie to loue, honor and ſerue hir, as our naturall louing prince and mother, and as the meane by whome we receiue all theſe thy good bleſſings, that hir Maieſtie perceiuing our diligence, and readineſſe to obeie and ſerue hir, may be the oftener put in mind to feare, honor, loue, ſerue & obeie thy diuine and incomparable Maieſtie.
                        Furthermore, inſpire hir roiall hart, O Lord, with thy diuine grace, that as ſhe hath begun to ſet foorth and mainteine thy ſacred truth, ſo ſhe may zealouſlie and boldlie increaſe, perſeuere, & continue in the ſame, whereby the filthineſſe and nakedneſſe of Antichriſt may be more and more reuealed, ſuperſtition more and more aboliſhed & remoued, and that old lieng ſerpent, & roring Lion ſathan, our ancient enimie, may be more and more reſtrained & kept backe from his malicious purpoſe, in ſeeking to deuour and draw vs all in ignorance & ſecuritie. Grant all this, O Lord, to our great comfort, hir honor, and immortall fame; yea to the diſcharging of hir owne conſcience, & kinglie dutie, and euermore reward & crowne theſe thine owne good gifts in hir, O Lord, not for the worke ſake, but for Ieſus Chriſts ſake. And when thou ſhalt, to our great ſorowe and loſſe, but to hir great ioie and profit take hir from vs; crowne hir, O moſt mercifull God, with a crowne of euerlaſting glorie, and giue hir the full poſſeſſion of that eternall kingdome, purchaſed by the blood of that immaculate Lambe, thine onlie Sonne our Sauiour and Redeemer Ieſus Chriſt, to whome with thee, and

the holie Ghoſt, three perſons and one immortall and euerlaſting God be all honour, dominion, praiſe, and thanks-giuing, for euer and euer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another praier for the Queenes Maieſtie, and for the ſtate preſent, and to come in our posteritie.
                        
                        
                           O Moſt gratious Lord GOD, and King almightie, iuſt & euerlaſting, vpon whoſe wil dependeth the rule, ſtaie and direction of althings both in heauen and in earth; giuing men power and dominion ouer the people and nations of the world, to whom being obedient to thy moſt holie will and commandements, thou giueſt wiſe, careful, induſtrious, vertuous, happie, and proſperous kings, princes, rulers, and magiſtrates, to rule and to gouerne, to the peace, bleſſing, comfort and wealth of the ſame: but the vnrighteous people, laſciuious, contemptuous, idolatrous, ſuperſtitious, blaſphemous, and rebellious againſt thy word and Maieſtie, ſhall be deliuered ouer to the hands and tuition of fooliſh, idle, diſſolute, negligent, and vnfortunate princes, rulers, and gouernours; by whoſe brutiſh diſorder, looſeneſſe, and follie, the ſtate, beautie, ſtrength and bonds of peace, iuſtice, loue and gouernement ſhall be neglected, broken, diſturbed, ſpoiled, and by inteſtine hatred and diſcords, or elſe by forren vanquiſhments and diſcomfitures deſtroied: whereby both land and people are left a praie to the inuaſion, ſpoile, and rauine of the greedie and victorious deſtroier, who in his mercileſſe rage executeth the plagues of thy iuſt wrath, O Lord; ſo that man, woman, child, beaſt, foule, nor fiſh, ſcapeth the ſtripes thereof. Their countries, townes, cities, and dwellings burnt, ſpoiled, rent, torne, and made waſte: iuſtice, lawe, diſcipline, nurture, ciuill fellowſhip,

honeſt arts and exerciſes, religion, knowledge, and feare of thee ſcorned, baniſhed, and perſecuted: and the land being filled with abhomination, beaſtlie tyrannie, ſlaughter, bloud, robberie, theeuerie, rapine, and murder: the people killed, ſtrangled, ſtarued, ſpoiled, and mocked, bound, and caried awaie to be ſold (as beaſts) in the market; to ſeruitude and ſlauerie, there to conſume their daies in miſerable thrall and ſorows: the kingdome and inheritance tranſported to the poſſeſſion of the deſtroier, who raiſed vp in thy wrath, and armed with the power of thy diſpleaſure, miniſtreth due puniſhment for the ſinne and diſobedience of ech reuolting nation that falleth away from thee, and will not be reconciled to grace: witneſſe of all the ſtates, empires, kingdoms, tongues, nations, peoples, and kindreds of the earth from the beginning of the world to this daie: but in theſe latter daies, ſpeciallie of the Iewes, Aegyptians, Armenians, Graecians, Italians, Hungarians, Polonians, and others, whoſe ſeruile thrall and calamities ought neuer to be out of our remembrance, which ſhould mooue vs continuallie to behold the bleſſing of thy loue, and the heauie ſorrowes of thy diſpleaſure.
                        Wherefore in the abundance of thy mercies and louing kindneſſe, and for loue of thy deere Sonne, whom through the gift of thy grace we profeſſe in the truth of his Goſpell: we beſeech thee, O mercifull Father, fauourablie to looke vpon this Realme and people of England. Turne not awaie thy face, O Lord: take not thy grace and holie ſpirit from vs: let vs ſtill enioie the bliſſe and comfort of thy louing countenance: keepe vs in thy waie, and couer vs vnder the ſhadowe of thy wings: ſuffer vs not to be taken from thee: make vs to followe and to put our whole truſt and confidence in thee, then ſhall we be ſafe. Thy mightie hand, O God, giueth the victorie, and in the power of thy fauour

ſhall the enimie be vanquiſhed, and his ſtrength brought to nothing. Safe is the citie where thou, O Lord, art the watch-man: but who ſo ſtandeth out of thy tuition, he is a readie praie vnto ye deſtroier: therefore go not farre from vs, O God. For thine elect ſake were the heauens and the earth, with all their implements, formed & made of nothing: for their preſeruation & maintenance was rule & gouernment deuiſed and ſtabliſhed. And for their ſakes are empires, kingdoms, countries and nations preſerued, ſaued and bleſſed: and for iniurie and ignominie done to them, and to thy truth and holie name are they changed, plaged, ſubuerted, and deſtroied. Great is thy mercie & compaſſion, O Lord, long ſuffering, & ready to forgiue: behold vs, O Father, and haue mercie vpon vs, remember not our iniquities, nor the iniquities of our forefathers; take not iuſt vengeance of our ſinnes, neither reward thou vs after our deſerts. Spare vs, good Lord; ſpare vs: and for thy ſweet Sonnes ſake Chriſt Ieſus our Sauiour, haue mercie vpon vs. Yea; Lord, haue mercie vpon vs, and vpon our poſteritie, holding continuallie thy holie hand ouer vs, and bleſſe vs. Increaſe our faith, & make our children, & childers childrē obedient to thy word; and through holie conuerſation in thy Sonne our redeemer, make vs and them acceptable vnto thy ſelfe, O GOD, that being ſanctified in faith and loue toward thy heauenlie will and Maieſtie, we and they may be deliuered from thy wrathfull diſpleaſure for euermore.
                        Powre foorth abundance of thy grace and bleſſing vpon our Queene, that in the fulneſſe of thy gratious fauour, ſhe may haue long life in health and happie daies, aided with faithfull, vertuous, & prudent counſellers and miniſters, to doo all things to the nouriſhing and maintenance of true religion and vertue. Increaſe the light of thy Goſpell, & the number of faithfull

and godlie preachers and miniſters of thy word, whoſe induſtrie and labour by the peace and tranquillitie of thy Church may largelie augment the number of thy Saints to the glorie of thy name, and to the ioie and bleſſing of the land and people. For the preſeruation and continuance whereof, in the bowels of thy fatherlie care and fauor, remember vs, O louing God. Leaue neither vs nor our poſteritie headleſſe, neither put vs ouer to the yoke of a ſtrange nor irreligious Prince; but after the bliſſe-full daies of this thy gratious handmaid our Queene, (whom, O Father, let it pleaſe thee to reſerue in happie and ioifull ſtate to the end) giue peace and concord to thy people, with a vertuous, wiſe, godlie, and fortunate Prince, whoſe conſtant zeale, care, induſtrie, and endeuour towards the cheriſhing and aduancement of thy truth and glorie, may purchaſe thy fatherlie loue and furtherance, to fill the land and people with all maner of bleſſings, as thy heauenlie wiſedome knoweth neceſſarie, where beautified with vertue and godlineſſe, it ſhall proſper and triumph in continuall peace and victorie, giuing honor and gladſome thanks to thy glorious Maieſtie, that with thy deere Sonne our Lord and Sauiour, and with the holie Ghoſt, reigneſt in vnitie of power, glorie and dominion, praiſed for euer and euer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another verie godlie praier meete to be ſaid of all true ſubiects, in time of anie priuie conſpiracie, or open rebellion, for our gratious Souereigne Queene Elizabeth, and for the preſent ſtate.
                        
                        
                           O Almightie God, King of kings, Lord of lords, the onelie God and gouernour of all things: thou art he, by whom alone kings doo reigne. Thou moſt high beareſt the rule ouer the kingdoms of men. Thou in Chriſt thine onelie Sonne, being

the moſt gratious Father of thy choſen Church; dooſt for the comfortable nouriſhing of it, diſpoſe the roiall ſtate among men. Through this thy grace it is come to paſſe, that we the Engliſh nation, now a portion of the ſame thy Church, doo enioie the gouernement of Elizabeth our Queene, whom thou haſt againſt all practiſes of thine and hir aduerſaris, deliuered out of perils, and by thy mightie hand brought to reigne ouer vs. Mercifullie guiding hir, thou haſt made hir to vs a mother; to thine afflicted flocke a nurſe, in that benefit which we haue in libertie, in true religion, and common peace: maruelouſlie protecting hir, thou haſt kept hir to defend vs, to vſe and hold this benefit quietlie. And euen now in thy mightie maruelous mercie, thou haſt diſcouered the practiſes of ſuch craftie & cruell enimies, as purpoſed to ſpoile hir of vs, vs of hir, and both hir and vs of thy religion and of peace, determining to deliuer vs ouer to the tyrannie of that ſhameleſſe man of Rome, and the bloudie ſword. In which purpoſe of miſchiefe, if thou haddeſt permitted them to preuaile, we had ſuffered for our ſinnes at thy hand, O Lord, moſt iuſtlie; but at their hands moſt vnnaturallie, and vniuſtlie. For we doo offend thy Maieſtie manie waies: we offend not them anie waies: yet ſuch is their wickedneſſe, that they will hate vs, onelie bicauſe we in truth doo profeſſe to ſerue thee. For this cauſe they conſpire againſt thee, O God, like hypocrites; againſt our Queene, like traitours; againſt our Commonwelth and countrie, like ſpoilers; againſt vs, euen as Cain did againſt Abel. But thy great goodneſſe hath deuiſed better for vs than they doo. Thou haſt ſpared vs, whom they would haue ſpoiled, thy wiſedome hath vnfolded their wickedneſſe, thy prouidence hath preuented their purpoſe. All honour, praiſe, with thanks-giuing in the congregation, and by euerie member thereof, be giuen to thee, O GOD

of grace, O Lord of pitie, O Father of mercie, for euer and euer.
                        And now we beſeech thee, O mercifull Father, be not prouoked with our ſinnes, to giue vs ouer to the luſt of our enimies; doo not make vs a reproch to theſe heathen. Let not the Iewes, the Turke, the Papiſt in our ouerthrowe triumph againſt thee, ſaieng; Where is now their God? But of thy rich mercie in Chriſt forgiue our ſinnes; by thy renewing ſpirit amend vs, and worke out this good worke, which thou haſt begun among vs. Confound & bring to naught the attempts of theſe and the like enimies, as thou didſt at Babel; infold them in the follie of their owne counſels, as thou diddeſt Achitophel; by thine Angel ſinite their force, as thou didſt to Senacherib; in their deſperate attempts let them be drowned, as was Pharao; in their treaſons ouertake them, as thou didſt Abſolon. If anie of them are to be conuerted, turne them, as thou diddeſt Manaſſes: otherwiſe let them feele their due puniſhment, as did Dathan, with his conſpirators, that of theſe alſo may be left an example of thy iuſtice to the poſteritie.
                        We doo likewiſe moſt humblie beſeech thee to continue thy goodneſſe towards vs, euer of thine old woonted mercie deliuer our Queene Elizabeth from euill, direct hir in the true knowledge of thee, to acknowledge thy benefits towards hir, and hir dutie towards thee. Kindle more and more in hir hart zeale to ſerue thee hir ſelfe, and to haue thee ſerued of vs entirelie. Guide hir ſtill to gouerne vs iuſtlie in godlie peace. Giue vnto vs alſo, which are ſubiects, thankefull harts to thee; faithfull to hir in thee; charitable towards all men; that all which liue vnder hir gouernment, counſellers, miniſters, and euerie other in their place and calling, may be throughlie ſanctified in holineſſe to liue before thee. Thus prolonging hir reigne ouer vs, doo thou in

hir plant thy religion among and in vs, ſo that it may with power reforme and rule vs, and remaine to our poſteritie after vs, that the praiſe of thy name may continue in the harts & mouths of the Engliſh nation, that England may ſaie for euer, The Lord be praiſed.
                     
                     
                        A thanks-giuing vnto God for his benefits beſtowed vpon this Realme of England, in ſuppreſsing the late Rebellion, with praier for the preſeruation and prosperous estate of our gratious Queene Elizabeth.
                        
                           ALmightie and euerlaſting God, the maker of heauen and earth, and Lord of all creatures, by whoſe mightie hand, the humble and lowlie are aduanced, and the proud and ſtubborne are thruſt vnder foote. We thy ſeruants giue thee moſt hartie thanks for thy great and bountifull goodneſſe, which thou haſt of late without our deſeruing, beſtowed vpon vs, both in deliuering vs from the cruell tyrannie and bondage, and perſecution, wherewith we were of late oppreſſed, and alſo in reſtoring vs againe to our former peace and quietneſſe, and to the free exerciſe of our faith, by the direction of thy ſacred Goſpell ſtill, maugre the heads of all our enimies, mainteined by thee amongſt vs to our comfort. For which thy ſingular benefits, and gratious liberalitie, O excellent father, becauſe we are in no wiſe able to render vnto thee woorthie thanks; therfore we make our humble ſute and requeſt vnto thee, O Lord, that it may pleaſe thee for thy holie name ſake, to accept our good willes in this behalfe, and to giue vs grace all the daies of our life, to remember this maruellous worke of thine, that partlie by the Chriſtian, deuout, and feruent praiers of thy humble handmaiden our moſt gratious Queene, and other of thy people, and partlie by

the ſure confidence and truſt that hir Grace euermore did put in thee, thou haſt without the force or ſtrength of men put down not onlie hir enimies, but alſo thine, and all thoſe that did both fight againſt thee and thy truth, and trauelled by all meanes to diſanull, and quite ouerthrowe the ſtate of the Church and religion now eſtabliſhed: which woonderfull and myraculous act, as thou haſt moſt gratiouſlie begun, ſo we beſeech thee, for thy tender mercies ſake, to go forward with it, and ſo to eſtabliſh it, as thy glorie may be aduanced thereby, and all the craftie deuiſes and malicious aſſaults of the diuell and his miniſters cleane ouerthrowne and ſubdued.
                        And now, O Chriſt thou King of kings, Prince of peace, & Ruler of Iſrael, haue mercie vpon our moſt deere ſouereigne Ladie Elizabeth: and grant, that as thou hitherto haſt moſt ſingularlie bleſſed hir, and adorned hir Maieſtie with manie thy ſpeciall good graces, bleſſings, and benefits, for thy glorie, and to our comfort: ſo with all thankefulueſſe therefore vnto thy Maieſtie, we continuallie, hartilie, and faithfullie praie thee, that the ioie of thy heauenlie countenance may ſtill moſt gratiouſlie ſhine vpon hir, to humble hir ſoule before thee, to be hir guide and director, to ſheeld, preſerue, and defend hir from the will and power of all hir enimies, and that both thine and hir aduerſaries may from time to time be made thine and hir footſtoole, and be euer kept vnder hir feet, as mire in the ſtreets, or as thinne ſcoom, filthie fome, light chaffe, withered haie, or burnt ſtubble before the wind. We beſeech thee alſo, O Lord, thou ſcepter of Iſrael, that hir ſcepter may yet growe greene, burgen, fructifie, and flouriſh in the fruits of true happineſſe, with glorie, victorie, princelie honor, dutifulneſſe, healthfull ſweetneſſe, tenderneſſe, beautie and comlineſſe, in hir moſt roiall ſtate and calling, euen as the Palme-tree ſafelie and well

ſet in a ſoile of all happineſſe, and that hir throne regall may ſteddilie ſtand for euer without winding, ſhaking, ſwaruing, tottering, or nodding, euen as the ſeate of Salomon; and that the daies of hir Graces regiment may be vnto vs for thy glorie, as the daies of heauen, and after this life ended, make hir partaker of the brightneſſe of thine and thy fathers euerlaſting glory, among thine annointed and elect, in the celeſtiall kingdome of euerlaſting renowme. Grant this O Chriſt, thou moſt mercifull King and Gouernor, that ſitteſt vpon the ſeate of Dauid, and haſt obteined an euerlaſting kingdome for all the choſen Iſraelites, euen for thy mercies ſake,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another praier for the Queene, and the eſtate of this Realme.
                        
                        
                           GRatious Lord, and moſt mercifull Father, we acknowledge thee Lord of lords, and the King of kings, creating at the beginning, and ruling all things euermore in heauen and earth, according to thy woonderfull wiſedome & power, and our ſelues to be thy poore ſeruants, the worke of thy hands, and the ſheepe of thy paſture, ſubiected to thy high Maieſtie, and depending vpon thy fatherlie prouidence for all things. Neuertheleſſe, ſeeing thou in thy wiſedome annointeſt Kings and Queenes, appointing them to rule ouer the people, to ſit as lieutenants in thy ſeate, to miniſter iuſtice, and moſt of all as fathers and nurſſes, to mainteine and cheriſh thy Church, commanding vs not onlie to obeie and honor them, but moreouer to praie for them, as watching ouer vs for our good. We therefore beſeech thee for thy great names ſake, and for Ieſus Chriſtes ſake, to ſhew thy mercie to all Kings and Princes that mainteine

thy glorious Goſpell, but eſpeciallie we praie thee to bleſſe our gratious Queene Elizabeth, in all ſpirituall bleſſings in Chriſt Ieſus, and in all temporall bleſſings, according to thy good pleaſure; that in the great meaſures of thine effectuall lawe, ſhe may more and more find great increaſe of vertue, and wiſedome, and ſtrength, in Chriſt Ieſu, to the faithfull and happie diſcharge of hir dutie, that hir holineſſe and ioie, and zeale of thy houſe may be multiplied & euerlaſting.
                        And ſeeing it hath pleaſed thee of thy ſingular mercie to giue hir this eſpeciall honor, firſt to ſuffer for thy glorious truth, and afterward miraculouſlie deliuering hir out of the hands of hir enimies, to ſet a Crowne vpon hir head, and to make hir the inſtrument to aduance thy glorie and Goſpell, for which ſhe ſuffered, and to bring hir out of darkeneſſe into light; out of perſecution into this great and long peace; as we giue thee moſt hartie thanks for this ſingular benefit, ſo we beſeech thee to make hir and vs euermore thankefull for it, and in thy good pleaſure ſtill to preſerue hir for the continuance of theſe bleſſings towards vs with all increaſe from time to time, to thy glorie, the benefit of thy Church, and hir infinite peace in Chriſt Ieſus the Prince of peace.
                        And furthermore, we praise thee for hir and the eſtate, that ſuch as be the enimies of the Goſpell, and hir enimies alſo for the defence therof, may not deſpiſe the peace offered them vnto repentance; but that they may accompt thy long ſuffering, and hir peaceable and vnbloudie gouernement an occaſion of ſaluation to their ſoules, and vnfeigned loue to the truth, and their mercifull Souereigne. Otherwiſe, if they ſtil remaine diſobedient to thy truth, diſloiall to hir Highneſſe, and dangerous to the ſtate; then, O God of all ſaluation, as thou haſt diſcouered them, ſo diſcouer them ſtill: as thou haſt preuented them, ſo preuent them ſtill, and let

their eies ware wearie with looking, and their harts faint with waiting for the comming of that which yet commeth not; neither let it come, O Lord, we beſeech thee: but a bleſſed and a long reigne to hir Grace, and and peace to Zion for euermore.
                        Alſo deere Father, ſo bleſſe, ſo loue, ſo in thy ſpirit ſanctifie and keepe hir, that ſhe maie in the ſpirit of counſell and fortitude ſo rule that other ſiſter alſo, namely this hir Common-wealth, that they may flouriſh together, and growe vp together as Palme-trees in beautie, and in ſtrength, giuing aid and help one to another; that in the Church the glorie of God may appeare as the Sunne in his brightneſſe, and that the land may flowe with milke and honie, and true peace abound therein, as in ye triumphant reigne of Debora.
                        Theſe graces, O Lord, are great, and we miſerable ſinners, vnwoorthie of the leaſt of them; therefore looke not to vs, but to thy ſelfe; not to our iniquities, but to thy great mercies; accepting the death and paſſion of thy Sonne as a full ranſome for all our offences, throwing them into the bottome of the ſea, and making his croſſe and reſurrection effectuall in vs to all obedience and godlineſſe, as becommeth thy Saincts; that to all other thy good bleſſings towards our gratious Souereigne, this may be added, that ſhe gouerneth bleſſedlie ouer a bleſſed people, a people bleſſed of the Lord, and beloued of the Lord; and that thy graces may abound in the Church & in the Common-wealth from daie to daie, till the daie of our tranſlation into thy kingdome, where iuſtice inhabiteth, where we alſo ſhall inhabit and reigne with thee, according to thy promiſe for euer. Grant vs theſe things, O mercifull father, for thy deere Sonne our Lord Ieſus Chriſtes ſake, in whoſe name we craue them at thy mercifull hand, praieng furthermore for them, as he hath taught vs to praie, Our Father, &c.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                        
                           Pſalme 72. Another praier for the proſperous eſtate and flourishing reigne of our right vertuous ſouereigne Queene Elizabeth.
                        
                           O GOD, without whoſe wiſedome no kingdome can ſtand, who of a ſpeciall conſideration haſt ordeined this kingdome in the familie of Dauid, teach our Queene Elizabeth whome thou haſt appointed, the rules of right gouernement: teach I ſaie, the Daughter of this thy Dauid, whome thou haſt choſen to thy ſelfe, the rule of righteouſneſſe, that ſhe may iuſtlie gouerne not hir people, but thine; eſpeciallie that ſhe may defend the poore againſt the iniuries of the mightie: thus the people being ſcattered heere and there in the mountaines and hilles, being ſafe vnder a iuſt gouernment, ſhall abound with all the commodities of peace.
                        Grant this vnto hir, that ſhe being far from all tyrannie, may be a ſure refuge for the poore, that ſhe may comfort the families oppreſſed with pouertie and iniuries, that ſhe may keepe vnder ye falſe accuſers with moſt ſharpe puniſhment; ſo will it come to paſſe, O Lord, that the ſtate of this kingdome being ordered by thine authoritie, all men, as it is meete, ſhall acknowledge and feare thee, and not for anie ſhort continuance of time, but that the Sunne and Moone ſhall ſooner ceaſſe their courſe, than thou ſhalt faile to be woorſhipped.
                        And thou againe wilt powre downe vpon thy people from heauen all good things, like a ſhowre comming downe vpon the new mowne medowes, and none otherwiſe, than thou vſeſt to water the earth with ſhowers in due ſeaſon, whileſt Elizabeth reigneth thus gouerned

by thy grace and holie ſpirit, the iuſt ſhall flouriſh, and great peace ſhall be ſo continued, as is the firme courſe of the ſtarres, and the Queene hir ſelfe ſhall haue dominion from the one ſea to the other, euen frō Euphrates, to the fartheſt coaſts of the earth.
                        The inhabitants of the countries of the deſert ſhall come vnder hir yoke, falling downe vnder hir feet, and hir enimies falling downe before hir, ſhall licke the duſt of the earth. The kings of Silicia and of the Ilands ſhall offer preſents vnto hir. The Ethiopians alſo, and the Arabians ſhall bring hir gifts; finallie, all Kings ſhall haue hir in admiration, for hir renowme and vertue, and all nations ſhall reuerence hir name and maieſtie. For hir righteouſneſſe ſhall bee praiſed through out all the whole world, becauſe ſhe heareth the crie of the poore, and doth defend the needie forſaken of other. She hath mercie on them that are needie, and ſhe refreſheth thoſe that are in danger of their life. She defendeth the poore againſt the iniurie of the mightie, neither doth ſhe ſuffer the violence done vnto them to be vnreuenged.
                        Therefore thou, O God, wilt keepe hir ſafe, and gold ſhall be brought vnto hir out of the midſt of Arabia: all men ſhall make praiers for hir life and ſafetie, and ſhall dailie wiſh all proſperitie vnto hir. And ſeeing the ſafetie of all the families of our nation conſiſteth in the preſeruation of hir Maieſtie, let vs hartilie (as we haue good cauſe) praie inceſſantlie for hir Grace, and for the ſafetie and welfare of the Church, and of all thoſe that loue and fauour hir therein. Defend, O God, with thine owne hand, this woorthie woman and ſacred Queene, whoſe endeuour thou haſt vſed to reſtore peace to thy Church, and religion to thy people. O ſaue this woorthie Princeſſe Elizabeth, I ſaie, whome for this purpoſe thou haſt indued with moſt rare and ſingular wiſedome, power, conſtancie,

and roiall gifts of grace. And grant that all men may dutifullie honour and obeie hir, as a prince of peace; a mother of Iſrael; a nurſe of thy Church, woorthilie for hir vertues ſet ouer vs by thee, O God, to reigne. Finallie grant, that in this gouernement of our paſtor & chiefe ſhepheard, there may want neither integritie, & vprightneſſe in taking of counſell, neither wiſedome in performing all hir enterpriſes according to thy will.
                        Then ſhall wheate be reaped euerie-where with full handfuls in the verie tops of the mountaines; the corne growing as high as the trees of Libanus: and there ſhall be ſuch a multitude of inhabitants in the cities, that they may almoſt ſeeme like plants ſpringing out of the earth: yea, then ſhall hir noble memorie, and roiall fame be for euer, euen durable as the ſunne; and our Queene Elizabeth be an example of all pietie and felicitie vnto all kingdoms & nations of the world, which ſhall accept hir bleſſed among women. But vnto thee, O Lord, the Prince of the celeſtiall companies, and the author of all things, for ſo woonderfull & rare gifts in hir Maieſtie, ſhall all poſſible praiſe be eſpeciallie giuen: yea, the fame of thy glorie be praiſed and magnified for euer and euer, and let it fill both heauen and earth. So, euen ſo let it be, O God,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another dailie praier, for the perpetuall happineſſe of our ſacred, and most gratious Souereigne, and Queene Elizabeth.
                        
                           O Almightie God, King of kings, and Lord of lords; in thine hand is all power both in heauen and in earth: thou confirmeſt kingdoms, & againe dooſt alter them according to thine heauenlie pleaſure: we praiſe thee; we magnifie thee; we extoll thine holie name, for that it hath pleaſed

thee to appoint ouer vs a good and gratious Queene, which dooth gouerne with counſell, and rule with wiſdome. Grant hir, we beſeech thee, continuall peace; long life, and much happines, and deliuer not hir Maieſtie into the hands of hir enimies. Rule thou hir mind, that ſhe may ſerue thee alwaies in feare, and reioice in trembling; let hir maintaine and imbrace pure religion, & defend hir people in the profeſſion of Chriſts Goſpell againſt all errors, and ſuperſtition whatſoeuer. Giue hir wiſedome and vnderſtanding to doo ſuch things, as are gratefull in thy ſight; profitable for vs hir ſubiects, and hurtfull to none.
                        O God, eternall Father, heare the petitions of Elizabeth our Queene, in all hir troubles; the name of Chriſt our Sauiour glorifie hir, and the comfortable aid of the holie Spirit vphold hir now and euermore. Be mindfull of hir grace for hir good; Lord remember all hir offerings; make hir praiers acceptable in thy ſight. Giue to hir according to hir harts deſire; fulfill all hir petitions, and proſper all hir purpoſes: that we may reioice in thy ſaluation, and triumph in the name of thee our God. Bleſſe hir, Lord, euermore, that wee may knowe that hir protector is in the clouds. Harken vnto hir from thy holie heauens. Oh ſend hir helpe from thy ſanctuarie, and aid hir from aboue by thy mightie right hand, which bringeth ſaluation. Let all hir enimies plainlie knowe, O GOD, that thou wilt ſaue thine annointed. For though ſome truſt in horſes, and other in chariots; yet will we remember the name of our God: they ſhall fall and be ouercome; but wee couragiouſlie will perſiſt.
                        O Lord, protect hir Maieſtie, and heare vs when we call vpon thee, that in thy ſtrength ſhe may reioice, and mightilie triumph in thy ſaluation. Grant hir the deſire of hir hart, and denie not the petitions of hir lips. For thou haſt preuented hir with notable bleſſings,

and put a crowne of pure gold vpon hir head. She hath aſked life of thee, and thou wilt giue hir a long life. Great is hir glorie in thy ſaluation, honour and fame haſt thou put vpon hir. Thou haſt ordeined hir for exceeding bleſſedneſſe, and dooſt comfort hir hart with thy cheerfull countenance. And why? Bicauſe ſhe delighteth in Chriſt; and doubteth not of thine euerlaſting mercie.
                        O God, that giueſt victorie vnto kings, and didſt deliuer Dauid from perill of the ſword; ſaue and redeeme our deere Queene Elizabeth, and deliuer hir from the hands of the children of another deuotion than ſhe is: whoſe mouth vttereth vanitie, and their right hand is a right hand of falſhood. Yea let hir hand, O Lord, light vpon hir enimies, and thy right hand find out all ſuch as hate thee, and enuie hir proſperitie. Put them into a burning fornace in the time of thy diſpleaſure: the Lord in his anger ſhall conſume them, and fire ſhall deuour them. Their fruit ſhalt thou deſtroy from the earth, and their ſeed from the ſonnes of men; bicauſe they intended euill againſt thee, and imagined miſchiefe againſt the innocent, which they could not bring to paſſe. Therefore wilt thou turne them into flight, and bend thy bowe againſt their faces. Triumph, O Lord, in thy vertue, and we will ſing out thy glorie, and commend thy power. Saue our Queene, O mercifull God, in deſpite of all hir enimies, which either ſecretlie or openlie go about to bring hir life to the graue, or hir glorie to the duſt. Lord, ſhield our Souereigne; exalt thine annointed; let thine hand aſſiſt, and thine arme ſtrengthen hir. Neuer let hir foes preuaile againſt hir, nor the child of wickedneſſe bring hir to deſtruction. Baniſh from hir Court all hir priuie enimies, and preſerue hir euermore from diſſembling friends.
                        Mercie and iudgement be Queene Elizabeths ſong:

vnto thee, O Lord, let hir ſing thy magnificall mercies. Worke in hir roiall hart an endeuour to be fullie inſtructed in the perfect waie of thy roiall lawes: for ſo much as thou haſt made hir Queene ouer this Relme. With thy grace open hir hart; inſtruct hir, and lead hir vp and downe in the midſt of hir people in perfectneſſe of hart. Let hir neuer ſet before hir eies anie diueliſh thing. Cauſe hir to deteſt the worke of back-ſliding from God: let that take no hold in hir. Driue far awaie from hir, the men of froward harts: let hir not once be acquainted with euill perſons. Who ſo priuilie ſlandereth his neighbor; let hir deſtroie him. Who ſo hath alſo a proud looke, and an hautie ſtomach, cauſe hir to loath him. Settle hir eies vpon ſuch in the land as are faithfull, that they may dwell with hir. Who ſo leadeth a godlie life, men of good conſcience; let ſuch be hir ſeruants. Let no deceitfull perſon haue anie place in hir houſe: him that telleth lies, or is a reuenger of bloud; cauſe hir ſpeedilie to caſt out of hir ſight. Finallie, grant hir will and power, O Lord of hoſts, dailie to ſuppreſſe all the vngodlie in the land, that ſhe may root out from the citie of God all wicked dooers.
                        Queene Elizabeth hath done that is lawfull & right: wherefore, O Lord, leaue hir not to ſuch as doo offer hir wrong. For thine owne goodneſſe ſake, take hir thine handmaid vnto thy protection: let not the proud oppreſſe hir with wrong. Deale with thine handmaid according to thy louing kindneſſe, and teach hir thy ſtatutes. She is thy ſeruant, grant hir vnderſtanding, that ſhe may knowe thy teſtimonies. Thy teſtimonies conteine woonderous things, therefore cauſe hir hart to be zealous in keeping of them. The firſt entrance of thy words will illuminate, giuing vnderſtanding euen vnto the ſimple. Worke in hir hart ſo feruent deſire of thy word, that through affection thereto, ſhe may be like one that panteth, & openeth his mouth for breath.

Looke thou vpon hir, O Lord, and be mercifull vnto hir, as thou vſeſt to doo vnto them that loue thy name. Direct hir ſteps in thy word: and ſo let no wickedneſſe haue dominion ouer hir. Redeeme hir from the fraudulent dealings of men, and cauſe hir to keepe thy commandements. Make the light of thy countenance ſhine vpon our Queene Elizabeth thine handmaiden, and teach hir thy ſtatutes.
                        Heare my praiers, O God, and giue good eare vnto mine interceſſions. For behold, from the ends of the earth I call vnto thee, for our deere Souereigne Ladie, Queene Elizabeth: whenſoeuer hir hart is in heauines, oh ſet hir vp vpon the rocke that is higher than ſhe. For hitherto thou haſt beene hir defence, and a ſtrong tower for hir againſt the face of the enimie. Let hir dwell. I beſeech thee, in thy tabernacle for euer; let hir truſt be vnder the couering of thy wings. For thou, O Lord, heardſt hir deſires, and haſt giuen hir an heritage ouer thoſe that feare thy name. O grant vnto the Queene a long life, that hir yeeres may endure manie generations. Let hir dwell before the Lord for euer. O appoint thy louing mercie and truth, that they may preſerue hir: ſo cauſe hir alwaies to ſing praiſe vnto thy name, that ſhe may daie by daie performe hir vowes, and keepe thy heaſts.
                        Finallie, giue thy iudgment, O Lord, vnto hir Grace, and thy righteouſneſſe vnto hir Counſell, that they may iudge the people with iuſtice, and the poore with equitie. Let the mountaines bring peace, and the little hils righteouſnes vnto the people. Let them iudge the afflicted among the people, and ſaue the ſonnes of the poore: make them to deſtroie the backe-ſlider, that he perſiſt not to afflict the miſerable, and ſuch as truſt in thy mercie and protection: ſo ſhall quietneſſe and peace abound among vs like the hillocks on the earth. Cauſe hir enimies to feare hir, ſo long as the ſunne

and moone ſhineth, from one generation to another. Water hir with thy grace from heauen, as thou didſt Gedeons fleece of wool with dew, and as thou refreſheſt with drops of raine the new cut graſſe vpon the earth. In hir daies let the righteous flouriſh, and great abundance of peace, ſo long as the moone is in the firmament. Defend the dominions that thou haſt giuen hir within the ſeas, and from the floud vnto the end of the earth. Cauſe hir foes to kneele downe before hir, and hir enimies to licke the duſt of hir feete. Giue hir a long and proſperous reigne; indue hir with abundance of riches and wealth; heape glorie and honour vpon hir head, and let hir be partaker alwaies of the praiers of the iuſt, and be dailie bleſſed. The Lord, euen the God of Iſrael, which onelie worketh woonderous things, bleſſe our gratious Queene Elizabeth: and bleſſed be the name of his Maieſtie, for euer: yea, let all the earth be filled with his glorious praiſe, Amen. And ſhe ſhall magnifie thee, O Lord, hir King, and ſhe ſhall praiſe thy name for euer. Euerie daie let hir giue thanks vnto thee, O Lord, and praiſe thy name for euer and euer. Grant this, O moſt mercifull Father, for thy deere ſonne our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſts ſake:
                        Amen, Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another praier for the Queenes moſt excellent Maiestie.
                        
                        
                           WOnderfull, O moſt excellent and almightie GOD, is the depth of thy iudgements. Thou King of kings, Lord of lords, thou which at thy pleaſure dooſt take awaie and tranſpoſe; roote out and plant; confound and eſtabliſh kingdoms. Thou of thy ſingular goodneſſe haſt deliuered our gratious Souereigne Queene Elizabeth thy

choſen Handmaid, when ſhe was almoſt at deaths dore; yea thou haſt deliuered hir out of priſon, and ſetled hir in hir fathers throne: to thee therefore doo we render thanks, to thee doo we ſing laud and praiſe, thy name doo we honour daie and night.
                        Thou haſt reſtored againe the libertie of our countrie, and the ſinceritie of the doctrine, with peace and tranquillitie of thy Church. Thine, thine, O Lord, was the benefit; the meanes, the labour and ſeruice was hirs, a burthen too heauie alas for a womans ſhoulders, yet eaſie and tollerable by thy helping hand. Aſſiſt hir therefore, O moſt mercifull father, neither reſpect hir offences, or the deſerts of hir parents, or the manifold ſinnes of vs hir people; but thinke vpon thy woonted compaſſion alwaies at hand to thy poore afflicted.
                        Preſerue hir kingdome, mainteine religion, defend thy cauſe, our Queene Elizabeth, vs thy ſheepe and hir people; ſcatter thine enimies, which thirſt after war, let them be aſhamed and confounded that woorſhip idols; let vs not be a praie vnto forraigne nations, nor to the people that knowe not thee, neither call vpon thy name.
                        Strengthen and confirme, O Lord, the good worke which thou haſt begun; inſpire our gratious Queene thy ſeruant, and vs thy poore flocke, with thy holie ſpirit, that with vncorrupt life we may ioine puritie of religion, as we may not yeeld and bring foorth wild and baſtard fruits, but mild and ſweet grapes and fruits beſeeming a liuelie faith and true repentance, and meet and conuenient for thy Goſpell, to the intent we may enioie this immortall treaſure, and that liuing and dieng in thee, we may finallie poſſeſſe the inheritance of thy heauenlie kingdome, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord. For thine is the kingdome, the power and the glorie, for euer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        
                        A forme of bleſſing or praier for our moſt gratious Queene Elizabeth Christ his deere ſpouſe, out of the Scriptures.
                        
                           COme downe O Lord, come with thouſands of thy Saincts, and appeare gratiouſlie vnto thy Church of Saincts. Come viſit the people and congregations of Iacob wherſoeuer aſſembled, whome thou ſo tenderlie loueſt, and which are humbled at thy feet, to yeeld thee thanks for all thy bleſſings and benefits receiued.
                        Come downe I ſaie, O God of Iacob, and bleſſe Iſrael, yea come and bleſſe thy choſen and deere beloued ſeruant Elizabeth our Queene, whome thou haſt ſet vp a mightie Prince and mother, ouer thy people and Citie Zion, and made the chiefe gouernour among the nations.
                        O let Elizabeth liue, and not die: neither let hir honour be anie thing diminiſhed for our ſinnes and offences.
                        Heare, O Lord, the voice of hir humble and dailie praiers, and let hir continue a Prince of peace, roiall Ruler ouer thy people. Hir hands ſhall be good ynough for hir, if thou helpe hir ſtill, as thou haſt done againſt hir enimies.
                        Right and light be with thine holie handmaid, whome thou didſt prooue with great temptations and triall, as thou didſt Ioſeph, before thou didſt annoint hir Queene, and whome hitherto thou haſt preſerued a pure and vndefiled virgin, to promote thy glorie, as thou didſt Dauid.
                        She that in all hir manifold afflictions hath more eſteemed the ſeruing of thee hir God, than ſauing of hir ſelfe, and loued not hir life ſo deere as ſhe loued thy

lawe, yea that preferred thine obedience before ſacrifice, and all things in the world beſide, O let hir, our gratious Queene Elizabeth, I ſaie, who hath thus don hir dutie, be plentifullie rewarded therefore of thee hir God from heauen, with the perpetuall crowne of glorie, and palme of victorie.
                        She, euen ſhe hath taught Iacob thy iudgements, and Iſrael thy lawe: ſhe hath put incenſe before thy face, and the burnt offering vpon thine altar. She, euen ſhe, O God, hath with Hezechias reſtored thy ſincere religion, and woorſhippeth thee aright, with euerie one that is godlie in thee.
                        Bleſſe therefore, O Lord, hir ſubſtance, and firſt fruits, and accept the works of hir hands.
                        Smite through the loines of them that riſe vp againſt hir, and of them that hate hir, that they riſe not againe.
                        O let the beloued of the Lord dwell euer in ſafetie by thee, yea doo thou Lord vouchſafe ſtil to be hir vale and defence all hir life long, and dwell with hir heere in the Church as hir beloued ſpouſe, head, and gouernour.
                        Laie thy left hand vnder hir head, and let thy right hand embrace hir, that ſhe may find continuall comfort in thy preſence.
                        O fountaine of the gardens! O well of liuing waters! Ariſe O North, and come O South, and blowe on thy ſpouſe, which is as a goodlie and pleaſant garden incloſed, and as a fountaine ſealed vp for thy ſelfe, and water it with the ſprings of Lebanon, that it may growe great, and that the ſweet ſpices and ſmell therof may flowe out into thy noſtrels, and thou eate of the pleaſant fruit in hir.
                        Kiſſe hir with the kiſſes of peace and righteouſnes, and let hir two breaſts ſatiſfie thee, & be like two yoong roes that are twins feeding vpon the lillies.
                        Set hir as a ſeale on thine hart, and as a ſignet

vpon thine arme, and let the lampe of hir loue be a verie vehement flame vnquenchable.
                        Let hir be a ſure wall or foundation, wherevpon thou maiſt build a golden palace; and let hir breaſts be as towers vnaſſaultable, that ſhe may be meet for thee hir ſpouſe to dwell in, and be in thine eies as ſhe that findeth perpetuall peace and quietneſſe.
                        O God, in whoſe ſight hir fathers did walke; thou, O God, which haſt fed hir all hir life long vnto this daie, and deliuered hir hither to from ſo manie, not euils, but deaths; bleſſe hir ſtill, euen with the bleſſing of Abraham, Iſaac, Iacob, and all the Patriarchs, with all the bleſſings of thy mercies promiſed vnto hir father Dauid.
                        In hir let Iſrael alſo be bleſſed: in hir let thy graces ſo plentifullie and manifeſtlie appeare, that the people may thence take a patterne of bleſſing thee, and teach their poſteritie to bleſſe and praiſe thee for thy goodneſſe and mercie, both towards hir and them.
                        For ſhe is to vs thy might, thy ſtrength, the nobleneſſe of dignitie, and the excellencie of power.
                        She as a lioneſſe is laid downe and couched ſafelie after the ſpoile. Who ſhall ſtir hir vp? Hir enimies doo all feare hir. And doo thou ſtill charge the daughters of Ieruſalem, that they ſtir not vp thy loue, nor awake hir, by troubling hir quietnes & peace, vntill ſhe pleaſe.
                        Hir fellowe virgins praiſe hir: hir hand ſhall be in the necke of hir enimies, hir fathers people doo bow downe vnto hir, ſaieng, Good lucke haue thou with thine honour: Ride on, becauſe of the word of truth, which thou embraceſt with meekeneſſe.
                        O let not the brethren of euill, the reuengers of bloud, nor the inſtruments of violence and crueltie bee in hir court and habitation! O let not crueltie or falſehood come into hir ſoule! Into their ſecrets let not hir ſoule come, neither let hir glorie be ioined nor ſtained

with the aſſemblie or damned crue of the wicked.
                        Curſe them that curſe hir; & bleſſe them that bleſſe hir; diuide them in Iacob, and ſcatter them in Iſrael, which ſhameleſlie in their rage dare cruellie attempt anie treacheries or treaſons againſt hir innocent and roiall perſon: yea, let them be condignelie puniſhed, whoſoeuer go about to trouble the ſtate, or ouerthrowe hir kingdome.
                        Let not the ſcepter depart out of hir hand, nor hir kingdome be diminiſhed; but let this thy moſt wiſe lawe-giuer, our meeke Moſes, continue amongſt vs with honour, to iudge thy people, and gather them vnto thee long in reſt and peace, euen vntill Silo our Sauiour Ieſus, the giuer of all proſperitie, come to crowne hir in his euerlaſting kingdome with his ſaluation.
                        Let hir ſee that reſt and peace is good, and that it is thou that haſt made hir to ouercome all hir enimies at the laſt.
                        Bleſſe hir Lord, with great increaſe of all maner of good, profitable, and pleaſant things. Hir bread let it be fat, that ſhe may giue pleaſant gifts woorthie ſuch a Queene.
                        Let hir be as an Hind ſent vnto vs from thee for a pretious preſent, giuing goodlie words to hir people.
                        Let Elizabeth be the daughter of increaſe, and like a flouriſhing and fruitfull palme tree by the waters ſide, whoſe ſmall branches, or virgins may run and ſpread themſelues fruitfullie alſo, and ſhew verie greene vpon the wals of thy houſe.
                        The archers hir enimies haue greeuouſlie prouoked hir, and ſhot againſt hir with venemous darts, they haue hated hir to hir hinderance and griefe: great and manie haue beene hir afflictions and perſecutions.
                        But hir bowe abode faſt and ſtrong, and the hands

of hir armes were ſtrengthened by the hands of the mightie God of Iacob. Hir deliuerance was euen by the ſtone of Iſrael, by whom ſhe is appointed a mother in Iſrael: euen by the God of hir father, who hath helped hir, and by the almightie, who hath bleſſed hir with heauenlie bleſſings from aboue; with bleſſings of the deepe that lieth beneath, and with bleſſings of the breſts, and of the wombe.
                        The time now is come, that the bleſſings of GOD ſhewed vnto hir father ſhall take effect, and be ſtronger in hir than the bleſſings of hir elders. Unto the vttermoſt ends of the hils of the world, they ſhall all be bleſſings vpon the head of Elizabeth, and on the top of the head of hir that is ſeparate from hir birth, and conſecrated from the wombe to dignitie and honour far aboue hir felowe virgins, and made the annointed of the Lord, to beare rule, and to haue dominion ouer men.
                        Euen as the morning light, when the ſunne riſeth gloriouſlie without clouds in the faire morning; ſo ſhe being iuſt, and ruling in the feare of God, let hir houſe growe, and be with thee, O God, that it may continue perfect in all points; ſure and euerlaſting, according to thy couenant and promiſe made to hir father Dauid: and not as the graſſe of the earth is by the bright raine, which groweth quicklie, and fadeth ſooner.
                        Hir beautie and glorie let it be like the firſt borne bullocke, and hir ſtrength as the Unicorne: with the horne of hir power let hir ſmite the people togither, euen the ten thouſands of Ephraim, and the ten thouſands of Manaſſes.
                        Bleſſe hir in hir going out and comming in, and proſper hir at home and abroad in all hir affaires by land and by ſea.
                        Make hir glad, ioifull, and willing to call thy people vnto the holie hill of Zion, and there in thy Church to

offer with them togither the offerings of righteouſneſſe, that ſhe and they may ſucke of the abundance of the ſea, and of the treaſures hid in the earth.
                        Bleſſe hir, O Lord, that ſhe may dwell as a Lion that catcheth for a praie, the arme with the head, and be moſt victorious ouer hir enimies that hate hir, and deſpiſe thee.
                        Bleſſe hir with thy graces, that ſhe may looke well to hir ſelfe, as in the beginning, when ſhe was a portion of thee the lawe-giuer, hid and reſerued for vs thy people, that ſhe may now come with the heads of the people, and execute the righteouſneſſe of the Lord, and his iudgements with Iſrael.
                        A lions whelpe let hir be to leape from Baſan, and make hir ſtrong inough to defend hir ſelfe from Balaks curſe, and againſt all the treaſons of Zimri and Achitophel.
                        O ſatiſfie hir with thy fauour, and fill hir with thy bleſſings: let hir poſſeſſe both the eaſt, weſt, ſouth, and north parts of the earth.
                        Bleſſe hir with people, and make hir acceptable vnto hir brethren and ſiſters, and to dip hir feet in oile.
                        Hir ſhoes let them be iron and braſſe, and hir glorie, health, wealth, and ſtrength continue as long as the ſunne.
                        Who is like thee, O God of Iſrael, which though thou ſit vpon the heauens, and rideſt vpon them as vpon an horſe; yet art thou hir helper & Sauiour, whoſe glorie is in the clouds and celeſtiall places.
                        The eternall God be ſtill hir refuge; and vnder the armes of the euerlaſting God let hir liue for euer: hee ſhall caſt out the enimie before hir face, and ſhall command hir to deſtroie them.
                        That then Iſrael, as euen now at this preſent, may ſtill dwell alone in ſafetie; and the fountaine of Iacob be plentifull in iſſue, in the land of wheate and wine,

and the heauens drop the dew of thy bleſſing plentifullie vpon hir, and hir countrie.
                        Happie and bleſſed art thou, O Iſrael, that haſt ſuch a Queene! Who is like vnto thee, O people, ſaued by the Lord, which is the ſhield of thy helpe, and ſword of thy glorie? Therefore thine enimies haue loſt their ſtrength to thee ward, & be ſubiected to thee, and thou ſhalt tread vpon their high places.
                        Bleſſe hir ſtill, O Lord, and giue power vnto thy Queene, that ſhe may be ſtrong to keepe the feet of thy Saints within the wals of thy Church, and to cauſe the wicked for euer to keepe ſilence in darknes,
                        Amen: Amen.
                     
                     
                        A praier to be ſaid mentallie or alowd of all true harted English men and women, for the Queenes Maieſtie, when ſhe rideth by them at anie time.
                        
                        
                           GOd ſaue your roiall Maieſtie; The GOD of gods preſerue your noble Grace; Good lucke haue you with your honor, O you the faireſt among women! Ride on, O Queene, according to the great worſhip and high renowme, wherewith the King of kings hath innobled you; bicauſe of the word of truth, of meekeneſſe and righteouſneſſe, which you profeſſe: ſo ſhall your right hand teach you terrible things. The Lord himſelfe be your keeper, and preſerue you from all euill. The Lord of heauen and earth be your defence on your right hand, and on the left. The Lord preſerue your going out, and your comming in, from this time foorth for euermore: ſo that the ſunne ſhall not burne you by daie, neither the moone by night. The King of kings haue pleaſure in your beautie, and make you his daughter, his ſpouſe, and virgin

moſt glorious within. The moſt mightie Iehoua eſtabliſh you in his ſeate of iudgement, euen in the throne of your father Dauid, that you may become an old mother in Iſrael. Peace & proſperitie be vnto them that loue your honour; but horror of conſcience, and confuſion of face be vnto all thoſe that hate you: for your indurable gifts of Gods graces, all people doo highlie praiſe you; and for your zeale to Zion, all the world doth honour you: therefore for Zions ſake alſo we wiſh you all maner of proſperitie: yea, bicauſe of the houſe of the Lord, which you haue reformed, and his religion, which your Grace hath reſtored, we will continuallie triumph in his mercie, and praie ſtill for the renowme of your moſt roiall name and Maieſtie, that your fame may more & more be vniuerſallie ſpred ouer the earth, and be remembred from one generation to another. For the Goſpels ſake, I ſay, which your Maieſtie doth maintaine, we will vnceſſantly praiſe God for you, and with lowd voices crie, and ſay: God ſaue our moſt gratious Queene Elizabeth; Ieſu bleſſe your Highneſſe; The holie Ghoſt from heauen comfort & conduct your Maieſtie in all your wais; Bleſſe our ſouereigne Ladie, O bleſſed Trinitie; Heape glorie and honour vpon Elizabeth our Queene, O glorious Deitie; Bleſſe hir ſacred Maieſtie, I ſaie, O God, frō this time foorth for euermore. O King of heauen receiue our Queene; receiue and imbrace this thy moſt glorious virgin and deere daughter, accompanied with hir felowe virgins, the princes daughters, and honourable women into thy tuition and protection. With ioie and gladneſſe, I ſaie, let hir, the liuelie image of thy princelie Maieſtie, be brought ſafe and vnhurt home againe vnto hir iuorie palaces; and at the laſt enter into the Kings court, hir fathers houſe, where ſhe may enioie a perpetuall crowne and euerlaſting kingdome, and reioice in thee hir God, hir ſpouſe, and hir Sauiour for euer and euer;

ſo ſhall ſhe and we hir people, giue thanks vnto thee, O Lord, world without end,
                        Amen.
                     
                  
                  
                     A compendious forme of praier for the whole eſtate of Christes Church, neceſſarie to be vſed of all estates at time conuenient, eſpeciallie euerie Sabboth or Holidaie in the Euening, by the Mother and Daughter, and their familie.
                     
                        A Pſalme preparing the hart to praier.
                        
                           Mother.
                           
                              O Come, let vs ſearch out, and trie our waies: and turne againe vnto the Lord.
                        
                        
                           Daughter.
                           Let vs ſeeke the Lord while he is to be found: let vs call vpon him while he is neere.
                        
                        
                           Moth.
                           Let vs lift vp our harts with our hands, vnto God in the heauens, for we haue ſinned, and haue rebelled: therefore will he not ſpare vs.
                        
                        
                           Daugh.
                           But euen the crowne of our head will he caſt downe: wo now therefore vnto vs that we haue ſinned.
                        
                        
                           Moth.
                           Our iniquities are ſealed vp as in a bagge: he hath ſet our miſdeeds before him, and our ſecret ſinnes in the light of his countenance.
                        
                        
                           Daugh.
                           We are weighed in the balance, & are found to lacke weight: we are altogether lighter than vanitie.
                        
                        
                           Moth.
                           Though he hath choſen vs to be his heritage, yet are we vnto him as a Lion in the forreſt: we dailie crie out againſt him, therefore hath he hated vs.
                        
                        
                           Daugh.
                           But will the Lord abſent himſelfe for euer? will he ſhew no more fauour?
                        
                        
                           Moth.
                           Is his mercie cleane gon for euer? doth his

promiſe faile for euermore?
                        
                        
                           Daugh.
                           Hath God forgotten to be mercifull? hath he ſhut vp his tender mercie in diſpleaſure?
                        
                        
                           Moth.
                           Uerelie this is the fruit of our infirmities: but yet the right hand of the Lord can amend all this.
                        
                        
                           Daugh.
                           Therefore will we leaue our complaint vpon our ſelues, and we will ſpeake in the bitterneſſe of our ſoules.
                        
                        
                           Moth.
                           And we wil ſaie vnto God, Condemne vs not: neither caſt thou off the worke of thy hands.
                        
                        
                           Daugh.
                           But rather turne thou vs vnto thee, and we ſhall be turned: renew our daies as of old, for thou haſt baniſhed vs long inough, and haſt beene ſore diſpleaſed at vs.
                        
                        
                           Moth.
                           Now are we poore and needie, O God, make haſte vnto vs: thou art our helper and redeemer, O God, make no tarieng.
                        
                        
                           Daugh.
                           O let not the oppreſſed returne aſhamed: but let the poore and needie praiſe thy name.
                        
                        
                           Moth.
                           That we which nowe doo ſow in teares, may heereafter reape in gladneſſe.
                        
                        
                           Daugh.
                           Bleſſed is the man whome thou chaſtiſeſt O Lord, and teacheſt him in thy Lawe.
                        
                        
                           Moth.
                           That thou maiſt giue him reſt from the daies of euill, whileſt the pit is digged for the wicked.
                        
                        
                           Daugh.
                           Bleſſed is the man whome thou correcteſt: therefore will we not refuſe thy chaſtiſement.
                        
                        
                           Moth.
                           For though thou make a wound, yet thou giueſt a plaiſter; and though thou ſmite, yet thy hands make whole againe.
                        
                        
                           Daugh.
                           Therefore O Lord, open thou our lips, and our mouth ſhall ſhew foorth thy praiſe.
                        
                        
                           Moth.
                           Bow downe thine eare, O Lord, and conſider our complaint: hearken vnto vs for thy truth and righteouſneſſe ſake.

                           SEeing that it hath pleaſed thee, moſt mercifull Father, ſo fauourablie to conſider the weakeneſſe and vnwoorthineſſe of mankinde; that whereas wee could of our ſelues, neither lift vp our eies vnto thee, becauſe of our weakeneſſe; neither yet hope for anie good thing at thy hands, becauſe of our vnwoorthineſſe, euen in this extreme miſerie haſt giuen vnto vs thy welbeloued Sonne Ieſus Chriſt, in whome we are not onelie made able to lift vp our harts vnto thee, but alſo may aſſure our ſelues, through his merits and paſſion, of thy fauour and mercie, in what ſo euer we ſhall aſke agreeable to thy good will and pleaſure.
                           As we doo firſt from the bottome of our hart yeeld vnto thee all thanks, honour and glorie, for this thine ineſtimable goodneſſe beſtowed on vs thine vnwoorthie ſeruants: ſo doo we likewiſe (beeing aſſured of thy mercie promiſed in Chriſt) dailie preſent our ſelues before thee, to the intent that through our faithfull praiers, we may dailie more and more receiue the fruits of this thy mercifull goodneſſe, to releeue our continuall neceſſities withall. We are heere, O Lord, in a ſtrange countrie: our enimies are on euerie ſide: which waie ſo euer we turne vs, we ſee nothing but either continuall conflicts, or elſe vtter deſtruction. Thou therefore, O holie Father, that haſt giuen vs thine onlie Sonne Ieſus Chriſt, to the intent that in his name we might call vpon thee; vouchſafe likewiſe to heare vs, what time ſoeuer we call vnto thee in his name; that ſith it hath pleaſed thee, to exerciſe vs with continuall tribulation, for our triall, through him we

may obtaine ſuch patience and ſtrength, that we may continuallie ſtand ſtronglie, to the maintenance of thy cauſe, to thy honor and glorie; and let not our deſerts ſo much prouoke thy diſpleaſure againſt vs, that therefore thou ceaſe to glorifie thy holie name in vs; but rather of thy goodneſſe forgiue thou our ſinnes, which to the hinderance of thy honor and glorie we haue committed: and giue vs grace, hartilie to repent vs of our miſdeeds, in ſuch ſort, that we may hencefoorth ſeeke thy face, and walke before thee in newneſſe of life, ſeeking thy honor and glorie aboue all things; that as it hath been hitherto hindered by vs to our ſhame, ſo now it may by al meanes be furthered, euen by vs likewiſe, to the vnſpeakable comfort of vs all, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord.

                              AND for becauſe we are fallen into theſe dangerous daies, wherein all goodneſſe decaieth, and ſin aboundeth: we humblie beſeech thee, mercifullie to behold the perillous eſtate of this age, and in this generall confuſion of the whole world, to multiplie thy graces and bleſſings on thy Church, that for as much as through thy mercies it is not of the world, it neuer be defiled with anie corruption, either of the world, the fleſh, or the diuell, neither yet that it periſh eternallie with the world.

                              BE mercifull therfore, O Father, vnto all the ſtates and members thereof, vnto Kings, Princes, and all ciuil Magiſtrates, and namelie to thy ſeruant Elizabeth our Queene

                           Mother.
                           
                              VNto vs all that are troubled, perſecuted, and cruellie handeled for thy name ſake: that although it pleaſe thee to make a ſharpe triall of our faith, that our enimies may be either aſhamed or confounded thereat; yet that thou leaue vs not ſo much deſtitute of thy grace, that we be not able to ſtand to the vttermoſt proofe thereof. Conſider, O Lord, the greatneſſe of our infirmities. And although our ſins haue deſerued thy wrath, yet let the equitie of the cauſe (which is thine) for the which we are troubled, purchaſe vnto vs thy fauour and mercie. Giue vs therefore grace to continue to the end, willinglie and ioifullie to beare whatſoeuer croſſe it ſhall pleaſe thee to laie vpon vs, and alwaies to be readie to defend, and ſet foorth thine honour and glorie, in whatſoeuer triall it be. And if we muſt needs drinke of the cup of triall, yet giue leaue vnto thy choſen to drinke the flowre of it, and reſerue the bottome and dregs thereof for the proud and obſtinate enimies of thy Goſpell, according to thy mercies promiſed in Ieſus Chriſt our Lord.

                           Mother.
                           
                              AND finallie, be thou mercifull vnto vs all, that are of the houſhold of faith, of what eſtate or calling ſoeuer we be; that we all remembring to what end thou haſt created vs,

and how dangerous a thing it is to walke ſo farre vnworthie of our vocation, as we now cōmonlie doo, may hartilie repent vs of our licentious, diſſolute, and wicked life, and euer crie vnto thee for pardon of the ſame. And grant, O heauenlie father, that the denieng, or vnfruitfull receiuing of thy word be not laid to our charge, to our vtter confuſion; but that now at the length we may not onlie receiue it, but ſpeedilie learne to bring foorth the fruits of the ſame: that applieng our liues to the exact rule thereof, and walking before thee in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, with continuall thanks and praiſe for all thy mercies ſhewed vnto vs, euer ſeeking thine honor and glorie in all our dooings, may at the end of this our ſhort and wearie peregrination, be taken vp vnto thee to euerlaſting reſt and quietneſſe, prepared for all beleeuers, through the merits of Ieſus Chriſt our Lord.

                           Amen.
                        
                     
                     
                        For increaſe of true preachers, complaining of the lacke herein.
                        
                        
                           Mother.
                           
                              AND now, O heauenlie Father, according as wee are taught by thy ſonne, we humblie beſeech thee, mercifullie to bow downe thine eies, and to behold how great and plentifull thy harueſt is, and euen now readie to be cut downe. O thruſt thou foorth good and faithfull laborers into it, to reape and gather it into thy barns. For though thy harueſt be great, yet are the labourers verie few. Behold, O Lord, the miſerable eſtate of theſe daies, how thy ſeelie ſheepe wander vp and down without a ſhepheard. Euerie one (almoſt) goeth by, about his own priuaite imaginations, accounting it no part of his dutie or charge to be mooued therat, or to take

pitie on their great miſerie. The better ſort ſee it, & lament it. But Lord, how few are thoſe that buſilie ſeeke the redreſſe thereof, their owne priuate cōmodities ſet apart? Surelie thy ſheepe, euen thy ſheepe, O heauenlie ſhepheard, are in perilous caſe: they are gone aſtray euerie one after their owne waies, euen to their owne deſtruction; they are on the barren mountaines, almoſt vtterlie famiſhed for lacke of food, & of themſelues are not able to returne to the fold. And in all theſe things, euen they to whom thou haſt giuen the charge of them, can for the moſt part, either ſleepe ſweetlie, or if they awake, then can they be content other waies to occupie themſelues. But, O Lord, wilt thou alſo alwaies ſleepe, and neuer ariſe vp to be reuenged on theſe ſo manifeſt iniuries? Wilt thou neuer diſplace theſe careleſſe hirelings, and raiſe vp in their places ſuch as ſhall be vigilant paſtors ouer their charge, although our ſinnes deſerue no redreſſe? Neither yet giue vs anie hope to find mercie in this matter? Yet for thy name ſake, and for thine honour and glorie, O Father, we ceaſe not dailie to preſent our ſelues before thee, as euen now at this preſent, humblie beſeeching thee, in the name of thy ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, to raiſe vp among vs (like as thou haſt begun) manie good ſhepheards, ſuch as will not let for anie paines, or diſcomfiture, to ſeeke out thy wandering ſheepe, and to defend vs from the bloud-thirſtie iawes of the rauening woolues. Good guides, ſuch as will both ſhew vs the waie, and they themſelues lead it vnto vs: yea and carie home the poore and faint vpon their backs. Good and faithfull diſtributers of thy word and myſteries; ſuch as will giue vs food in due ſeaſon, breaking vnto vs the liuing bread, and giuing vs to drinke of the water of life. That whereas now manie of vs are almoſt periſhed with famine, & therefore are becom lothſome, and ill liking in thy ſight: we may therby (through thy

helpe) be recouered from all lothſomneſſe and ill liking, and be reſtored againe to our former plight and beautie, that we may be ſtrong, and growe in all grace and godlineſſe. And altogither in the ſafetie of thy fold, with one hart and voice declare thy mercie and goodneſſe, and woonderous works, and ſanctifie thy holie name for euer. Grant thou this, O heauenlie Father, and Lord of the harueſt; not for our ſakes, but for thy name ſake, and through the merits of Ieſus Chriſt our onlie guide, and chiefe ſhepheard, who liueth and reigneth with thee, and the holie Ghoſt, now and euer.
                        
                        
                           Daughter:
                           
                              Amen.
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        For all Vniuerſities and Schooles.
                        
                           Mother.
                           
                              BLeſſe thou therefore, O Lord, with the dew of thy ſpirit all Uniuerſities and Schooles; that ſith it hath pleaſed thee, that from them (as by thine appointed meanes) we ſhould haue our preachers and teachers, they may be there inſtructed in all godly knowledge and learning, and be made fit to walke woorthilie in their vocation, at what time ſoeuer it ſhall pleaſe thee to call them forth. Grant, we beſech thee, that as they ought to be lights and nurſſes vnto their countries; euen ſo they may giue vnto them a godlie and perfect life, and nouriſh them vp in good and ſound doctrine, to thy glorie, our comfort, and the diſcharge of their duties. And for bicauſe that now a daies charitie waxeth cold, and the number of couetous worldlings is much increaſed; which ſeeke rather to keepe backe their liuings, and to plucke awaie from them, rather than to beſtowe anie thing to the maintenance of their ſtudie: bleſſe thou them therfore with all things ſufficient, to the ſeruice

of thee, and increaſe of good learning; that the lacke thereof be no hinderance to the building of thy houſe, and to the ſetting foorth of thine honour and glorie. And remooue from among vs, moſt mercifull Father, whatſoeuer is occaſion of let or hinderance vnto all thoſe that couet knowledge, to the ſanctifieng of thy holie name, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord.
                        
                        
                           Daughter:
                           
                              Amen.
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        For the good eſtate of this Realme.
                        
                           Mother.
                           
                              BEcauſe alſo thou haſt commanded vs to call vpon thee in the daie of troble, promiſing that thou wilt heare our praiers: we therefore humblie beſeech thee to be fauourable vnto this our Realme; and not to viſit our offences ſo ſharpelie, neither to giue vs to drinke of ſo bitter a cup, as vnto our iudgement it ſeemeth thou haſt prepared for vs. What are we, O Lord, that wee may abide the force of thy iudgments? We denie not, but that we haue moſt woorthilie deſerued whatſoeuer puniſhment thou haſt euer hertofore powred forth vpon anie other nation. But ſith thy name is now called on among vs; ſith we make no account of anie helpe, but onlie in thee; ſith we acknowledge our offences, and humblie deſire pardon for the ſame in Ieſus Chriſt: O let not thy iuſt iudgements laie hold vpon vs; if it be expedient for vs, and more to thy honour and glorie, that we taſte of thy mercie. Thou haſt hitherto dealt exceeding mercifullie with vs; thou haſt planted among vs a goodlie vineyard, and that of the beſt plants: thou haſt walled it round about, and watered it plentifullie with the dew of thy bleſſing; in ſo much that thou couldeſt haue done no more for vs,

than thou haſt done; neither haſt thou dealt ſo with other nations. But we (alas) wretched ſinners, contrarie to the deſerts of this thy louing kindneſſe, haue brought foorth wild grapes, which thou hateſt; in ſteed of good and ſweet grapes, which thou lookeſt for. Wee haue taken thy word into our mouthes; but we haue hated to be reformed thereby: yea we haue vtterlie deſpiſed thy holie word, and had the preachers thereof in deriſion, and ſo haue we made open the readie waie vnto all our damnable works, blaſphemie, idolatrie, murther, adulterie, pride, couetouſneſſe, diſobedience, ſenſualitie, vnmercifulneſſe, oppreſſions, ſlanders, vnthankfulneſſe, & whatſoeuer elſe our corrupt natures, caſting aſide grace and diſcipline, is woont to bring foorth. And whileſt we did all theſe things, thou heldeſt thy peace, and winkedſt thereat: therefore did we fooliſhlie imagine, that thou art like vnto vs, and delighted with ſinne, as we are. And thus haue we in all our works prouoked thy diuine Maieſtie to greeuous diſpleaſure againſt vs. But now, O holie God, ſeeing that by thy long ſufferance, thou haſt ſo mercifullie ſtriken our hard harts with ſecret conſideration of our miſerable eſtate: we beſeech thee for Ieſus Chriſts ſake, to giue vs likewiſe a repentant hart, ſorowfull for all our former miſdeeds; that thereby we may alſo attaine to the promiſes, which thou haſt annexed therevnto, namelie; that thou breake not downe the wall of this thy vineyard; that thou ſuffer it not to be eaten vp, or troden downe; that thou laie it not waſte, ſo that briers and thorns growe vp therein. And that thou command not the clouds not to raine vpon it; neither that thou turne our roote into rottenneſſe; neither yet that thou make our buds to riſe vp like duſt, bicauſe we haue caſt off thy lawe, O Lord God of hoſts, and contemned thy word, O holie one of Iſrael. O make vs not a byword vnto our neighbours, and a ſcorne

vnto thoſe that dwell about vs; but rather grant, we beſeech thee, that hencefoorth we may hartilie repent, and walke before thee in newneſſe of life, to thy honor and glorie, to the example of our neighbours, to the conuerſion or confuſion of our enimies, and to our euerlaſting comfort, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord.
                        
                        
                           Daughter:
                           
                              Amen.
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        A praier for repentance.
                        
                           Mother.
                           
                              ALthough our infirmities doo euidentlie appeare, and by diuers waies ſhew foorth themſelues vnto vs, almightie and moſt mercifull God; yet in nothing more than that we cannot perceiue and behold our owne wickedneſſe, in ſuch ſort as it is indeed. With our tongs we can not but confeſſe (becauſe thou thy ſelfe haſt ſaid it) that we are altogither vnrighteous, that there is not one of vs that doth good, & that we all imagine miſchiefe. But although we are driuen by thine eternall truth, outwardlie to confeſſe the ſame; yet haue we no ſuch inward feeling thereof as we ought to haue: becauſe we are altogither cloſed vp in our owne ſtubberneſſe and ſelfe-loue. Wherfore it commeth to paſſe, that we can neither repent vs of that we ſhould amend, neither yet hartilie acknowledge that we certainlie knowe to be within vs. But, O holie God, how long ſhall we be cleane without vnderſtanding? How long ſhall our fleſh haue dominion ouer thy good ſpirit in vs? How long ſhall the cloud of our vnſenſibleneſſe darken and blemiſh our inward ſight? Uerelie our ſinnes haue deſerued, that not onlie thou hide thy face awaie from vs for a time; but that thou ſhouldeſt vtterlie caſt vs off from thy fauour and grace, to eternall

damnation. But ſith that thou art wont to deale more mercifullie euen with the ſonnes of men, and vnto vs alſo haſt giuen a good likelihood thereof, in that that now thou haſt ſtriken our harts with ſome feeling of our owne wretchedneſſe, which putteth vs in good comfort and hope, that thou haſt done it to this end, to the intent that thou maiſt beſtowe larger graces on vs alſo: therefore we are ſomewhat emboldened (although we are but duſt and aſhes) humblie to deſire of thee, that in the name of thy ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, euen now at the length, thou wilt vouchſafe to giue vnto vs the grace of hartie repentance, that as wee knowe, ſo likewiſe we may acknowledge vnto thee, all our vnrighteouſneſſe, and hencefoorth labour the more buſilie, without anie delaie, to amend thoſe things wherein we haue hitherto offended thee. We knowe, O Lord, that this is the onelie time of mercie, in ſo much that if we obtaine it not, during this our mortall life, there remaineth nothing for vs to be looked for, but a fearefull and a rigorous ſentence of iudgement. Grant therefore, we beſeech thee O mercifull God, that ſith we are now in a moſt damnable eſtate, by the reaſon of our continuall diſobedience, out of the which we can by no meanes recouer our ſelues, but by thy mercifull gift of repentance, that we may euen now obtaine at thy hands not onlie it, but all other thy graces annexed therevnto, ſuch as are moſt needfull for vs, to the accompliſhing of thy will, and to the ſetting foorth of thy honour and glorie, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord and ſauiour, who ſitteth at thy right hand euen now and euer, to make interceſſion for vs.
                        
                        
                           Daughter:
                           Amen.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                        For the authoritie of diſcipline to be eſtabliſhed in the Church.
                        
                        
                           Mother.
                           
                              BEcauſe that crookedneſſe and diſobedience haue taken ſo deepe roote in all eſtates, that now adaies manie dare boldlie refuſe all Eccleſiaſticall cenſure, to the great hinderance of the courſe of the Goſpell; grant therefore we beſeech thee, that like as thou haſt dealt with other nations, euen ſo may it pleaſe thee now at the length, to extend thy like mercie vnto this Realme alſo, and all others that are in the ſame neceſſitie; that the authoritie of Eccleſiaſticall cenſure and diſcipline (which for our ſinnes thou haſt hitherto kept backe from vs) may be placed in the Church, to the due puniſhment of ſinfull life, and contempt of thy word, in ſuch ſort, that it may extend indifferentlie vnto all eſtates both high and lowe, as well to the terror of the ill, and comfort of the good, as alſo to the ſpeedie and perfect reformation of all ſuch things as are yet diſordered in this thy Church; through the ſame Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, in whoſe name, for theſe & all things elſe expedient for vs, we lift vp our harts vnto thee, ſaieng as he hath taught vs:
                        
                        
                           Mother and Daughter altogether.
                           Our Father, &c.
                        
                        
                           Mother.
                           Into thy hands, O Lord, doo we commend our ſelues wholie, both bodie and ſoule: vouchſafe to receiue vs, Lord God of mercie.
                        
                        
                           Daughter:
                           Amen.
                        
                        
                           Mother.
                           In thee, O God, haue we truſted, let vs neuer be confounded.
                        
                        
                           Daughter:

                           Mother.
                           Deliuer vs, we beſeech thee, from the power of darkeneſſe of this world, the fleſh and the diuell.
                        
                        
                           Daughter:
                           Amen.
                        
                        
                           
                           Mother.
                           Lord let it be done vnto vs, as we doo put our truſt in thee.
                        
                        
                           Daughter:

                           We beleeue, O Lord; Lord helpe and make perfect our vnbeleefe.
                        
                        
                           Daughter:

                           Mother.
                           
                              THeſe, O mercifull Father, and all other thy graces, ſuch as be moſt agreeable to thy will, to the ſetting foorth of thy honor and glorie, and to the aſſurance of our ſaluation, grant thou vnto vs (we beſeech thee) in the name of thy ſonne Ieſus Chriſt. And that we may vtterlie caſt off all ſinfull affections, and hencefoorth leade our liues in holineſſe, righteouſneſſe, and innocencie, yeelding vnto thee continuall thanks, for all thy benefits and mercies: we beſeech thee ſend downe into our harts thy holie ſpirit, to prepare, inſtruct, and guide vs in all our thoughts, words and works, to the fulfilling of thy good will and pleaſure; to whome, the Father, the Sonne, and the holie Ghoſt, three perſons and one God, of eternall and infinite maieſtie, be all praiſe, thanks and glorie, at all times, in all places, in all things, aboue all things, and euen ſo in vs all now and euer.

                           Mother.
                           Bleſſed be the Lord.
                        
                        
                           Daughter.
                           Thanks be to God.

                                 ¶ If, when we are deſirous to commend the Church vnto the bleſſings of God (which in our dailie praiers we ought to doo) neceſſarie buſines will not well impart ſo much time, as the forme of theſe praiers require; then after good conſideration, both of Gods former benefits towards

vs, and of the manifold infirmities of the Church, we may doo it in theſe few words.
                              
                           
                        
                        
                           Mother:
                           O Lord heare my praier.

                           Mother.
                           
                              TO thee, O heauenlie Father, be all thanks, honour & glorie, for becauſe it hath pleaſed thee, through the merits of Ieſus Chriſt, to deale ſo mercifullie with vs. For looke how high the heauen is in compariſon of the earth, ſo great hath thy mercie beene towards vs, at all times, and in all things, much beyond that that our fooliſh harts could wiſh or deſire. For the which, as we doo yeeld vnto thee all poſſible thanks, from the bottome of our harts; euen ſo doo we humblie beſeech thee, with thy fatherlie goodneſſe, to ſupplie all our infirmities wherewith we dailie offend thee. Bleſſe thou therefore, and be mercifull vnto thy Church vniuerſallie, and to all the members thereof, and namelie vnto all Princes and ciuil Magiſtrates, that by their gouernment thy name may be alwaies ſanctified, and thy glorious kingdome faithfullie prepared. Unto all Biſhops and ſpirituall paſtors, that they may diligentlie execute the charge committed vnto them. Unto all ſubiects and inferiors, that they may in thee, and for thee, obeie, ſerue, loue, honor all ſuperior powers. Unto the ignorant, and ſuch as are not yet brought to the knowledge of thy truth, that their eies may be opened, to the vtter aboliſhing in them, whatſoeuer is not of faith. Unto the malicious perſecutors alſo, that either their harts may be turned, or elſe that thou take them awaie from among vs. Unto the perſecuted and afflicted, that they may end their conflicts with victorie, whether it be by death or deliuerance. Unto thy

harueſt, that it periſh not for lacke of reapers. Unto Uniuerſities and Schooles, that they may attaine to ripeneſſe of good and godlie knowledge, and vſe the ſame to the furtherance of thy kingdome. Unto this our Realme, that we may hartilie repent vs of all our ſinnes; that thou maiſt alſo repent thee of the puniſhment, which thou haſt prepared for vs, and euer continue thy goodneſſe towards vs as thou haſt begonne. Giuing vnto vs, among thine other benefits, ſuch authoritie of the eccleſiaſticall ſword, to the amendment of all things, and reformation of all eſtates, as may be moſt to the propagation of thy truth and true religion. Finallie, vnto vs all that are of the houſhold of faith, that all other things ſet apart, we may onelie ſeeke thee and thy kingdome, and euer ſing praiſes vnto thy holie name.

                           The Preface.
                           
                              BE of good cheere, and feare not (O you that are of a fearfull hart,) for behold your God commeth his owne ſelfe to take vengeance on his enimies, and will deliuer you: Hoſanna to the ſonne of Dauid.
                           
                              
O daughter Zion be glad; O daughter Ieruſalem reioice. For lo, the King commeth vnto thee, euen the righteous, thy Sauiour, lowlie, meeke and ſimple; riding vpon the fole of an aſſe, and bringing his recompenſe with him: Bleſſed is he that commeth in the name of the Lord.
                           Out of Zion hath God appeared in perfect beautie: Hoſanna in the higheſt.
                           Remember me, O Lord, according to thy fauor that thou beareſt vnto thy people. O viſit me with thy ſaluation. Hoſanna.
                           
                           Shew me thy waies, O Lord, and teach mee thy path: Hoſanna in the higheſt. Hoſanna.
                           
                        
                        
                           The praier.
                           
                              THE time is now at hand, when the Church calleth into mind the benefits of the ſonne of GOD, which taking vpon him our fraile nature, appeared to the world, and came to viſit vs in great humilitie. And at the laſt daie and reſurrection of all mankind, will come againe in his glorious Maieſtie, to iudge both the quicke and the dead; and ſhew himſelfe both to puniſh his enimies with euerlaſting paines, and to adorne his Church and choſen people with eternall glorie. Wherefore, O Sonne of God, Lord and Sauiour Chriſt, which as this daie, in roiall pompe didſt enter into the holie citie Ieruſalem for a publike teſtimonie of thine appearing: remooue all impediments, we praie thee, that may hinder thy comming, and make a plaine, and moſt eaſie waie for thy ſelfe vnto vs. Gather vs, we beſeech thee, into that companie, which are prepared to receiue thee the King of all kings, and which ſet foorth thy glorie in ſpirituall ſongs, (not onelie this daie

through all the world, but alſo continuallie) and beare palmes of victorie before thee, and ſpred their garments in the waie for ioie of thy comming.
                           Aſſiſt vs, that being greatlie ſeparated from the damned crue of diuels, and wicked perſons; wee may ſound and ſet foorth thy truth, in perfect confeſſion, and righteouſneſſe all the daies and time of our life. Bee thou our King, both here in this world, and hereafter in the world to come: repleniſhing vs againſt all the wicked enterpriſes of thine enimies, and making vs (though babes and littleones) to extoll and magnifie thy name for euer. Keepe vs thy weake children depending vpon thee, and running vnto thy lap, euen as infants vnto their parents. Make vs to followe thy words, which through thy ſpirit doo ſound within vs, and powre thy wiſedome into vs miſerable men and women, that the pride and power of thine enimies may be confounded.
                           Grant that with gratefull minds we may publiſh abroad thy glorious victorie, according to our calling and abilitie; cheriſh thy miniſters, and venter both our life & liuing for the maintenance of thy truth. Moreouer, bleſſe vs, O thou bleſſed ſeed of Abraham, by the vertue of thy preſence: number vs among thy choſen, which haue their names from thee. And finallie, giue vs grace now in the time of this mortall life, ſo to caſt awaie from vs the works of darknes, and to put vpon vs the armour of light; that in the laſt daie of thy ſecond comming in the clouds, we may riſe through thee, to life immortall: and ſo, being adorned with that glorie, which thou haſt receiued from thine eternall Father, we may perpetuallie praiſe and extoll thy Maieſtie, both heere in this world, and for euermore in the world of worlds to come,
                           Amen.
                           
                              Hoſanna to thee O ſonne of God in the higheſt. Hoſanna.
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                        2. On Chriſtmas daie. Of the natiuitie and birth of Christ our Sauiour.
                        
                        
                           The Preface.
                           
                              A Child is borne vnto vs, and a ſonne is giuen vnto vs. Glorie be to God on high.
                           Unto vs is borne this daie, in the citie of Dauid a Sauiour, which is Chriſt the Lord. Halleluiah.
                           
                           The Lord ſent a word vnto Iacob, the ſame is come into Iſrael, an euerlaſting Prince of peace. Halleluiah.
                           
                           Mercie and truth are met togither; righteouſneſſe and peace haue kiſſed each other: truth ſhall flouriſh out of the earth, and righteouſneſſe hath looked downe from heauen vpon vs, to ſpeake peace vnto his people, and gladneſſe to his Saints. Halleluiah.
                           
                           Of the fruit of thy bodie will I ſet vpon thy throne, and in Zion ſhall I make the horne of Dauid to flouriſh. Halleluiah.
                           
                           The Sunne commeth foorth of (his tabernacle) the heauens, as a bridegroome out of his chamber, and reioiceth as a Giant to run his courſe. Halleluiah.
                           
                           He ſhall giue his Angels charge ouer thee, to keepe thee in all thy waies: they ſhall beare thee in their hands, that thou hurt not thy foot againſt a ſtone. Halleluiah.
                           
                           For thou art fairer than the children of men: full of grace are thy lips, bicauſe God hath bleſſed thee for euer: yea God, euen thine owne God hath annointed thee with the oile of gladneſſe aboue thy fellowes. Halleluiah.
                           
                           Therefore in this daie of thy power ſhall the people offer the free-will offerings with an holie worſhip; bicauſe the dew of thy birth is of the wombe of the morning. Halleluiah.
                           
                           
                              
Glorie be vnto God on high, in earth peace, and good will towards men: Halleluiah, Halleluiah, Halleluiah.
                           
                        
                        
                           The Praier.
                           
                              NOW is the ioifull time, wherein all Saincts both in heauen and earth doo magnifie and praiſe almightie God, for the incarnation of his onlie begotten Sonne our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt; who as this daie was borne of the pure Uirgin Marie, the which alſo the holie Angels of the Lord did celebrate with a moſt heauenlie ſong. And no doubt, the bleſſed companie of the elect departed out of this world, enioieng the comfortable ſight of God, repleniſhed with eternall wiſedome, light and righteouſneſſe, yeeld moſt humble thanks vnto the Sonne of God their Sauiour and Redeemer, for his incomprehenſible goodneſſe declared vnto mankind, in the order of their redemption, for the infinite benefits of their ſaluation, and for taking our fraile nature and miſerable fleſh (ſubiect vnto all calamities and deſtruction) vpon him, and carieng the ſame and vs therewith vnto eternall life.
                           We therefore liuing in this vaile of wretchedneſſe, lift vp our heads vnto thee, O notable Silo, which art the fruit of the Uirgin; and ſeparate our ſelues from the deteſtable & damned crue of vnpure ſpirits; and of men powring out blaſphemous outcries againſt thy truth and glorie. From our harts we praie thee regenerate and make vs thy children by adoption and grace, and dailie renew vs by thy holie ſpirit, to glorifie thee. For of our ſelues we are nothing but fleſh and corruption, as they that are borne of fleſh, and can not become thy children, except we be begotten and borne againe by a new birth of the holie Ghoſt.

Therfore we beſeech thee renew vs, I ſay, dailie by thy mightie power from aboue, that being borne of the ſpirit, our harts and our hands, our deeds and deuiſes, and whatſoeuer is in vs, may be ſpirituall as thou art. Ioine vs to the ſocietie of thine holie Angels, which ſing glorie to thee on high; and make vs members of that congregation, which is knit vnto thee by an indiſſoluble bond of euerlaſting peace, with gratefull minds to record and celebrate thy benefits.
                           We thanke thee for ſauing mankind from eternall damnation, and for making the attonement betweene thy father and vs, through thine incarnation, For ſo it was expedient, according to the order of iuſtice, that the puniſhment of a guiltleſſe man, ſhould quit mankind guiltie; and that a ſufficient ſatiſfaction might be made, it was required that he which would be the mediatour, ſhould be God. God, I ſaie, to abide the intollerable burthen of Gods diſpleaſure, to vanquiſh death, and to reſtore vnto man life and ſaluation, to enter into the moſt holie place, and be an eternall Prieſt. God, to vnderſtand the ſecret counſell of the father, to be priuie vnto the cogitations of harts, to heare the grones of all men, to be the King of his flocke, defending the ſame againſt the power of ſathan and his members. Finallie God, to place his Church raiſed from death, in the eternall kingdome of his moſt glorious father. Now, foraſmuch as the nature of man was not able to bring theſe things to paſſe, we thanke thee O our ſauiour, being the word, the expreſſe image, and interpretor of the father, for vouchſafing to take the office of a mediatour betweene God and vs.
                           Begin in vs, we moſt humblie beſeech thee, this ſo great a benefit. We are weake, we are fowle and filthie; but as thou waſt brought into this miſerable world, borne a weake infant, and that in a pinching time of the yeare, ſwadled with wretched bands, endued

with the rags of a miſerable nature, and laid in a manger among the brutiſh kind, being notwithſtanding the verie wiſedome of thine eternall father. So let thy wiſdome appeare in vs miſerable men & womē in this wofull darkeneſſe of ours, among the blacke clouds of this doting age, amongſt theſe troubles and deſtructions of Common-weales. Kindle in vs the ſparks of that wiſedome, which ſhall be perfect in the life to come, and ioine vs to the felowſhip of thy Saincts. Grant that from the hart, and ioifullie we may aſcribe all glorie, fame, and honor vnto thee the true God, which art wiſe, righteous, almightie, pure, liberall, and mercifull, according to the rule deſcribed in thy commandements, which didſt ſend thy Sonne to bring vs to that glorie; whereof we were depriued, and to reſtore vs againe to our firſt integritie, which was loſt through ſinne.
                           O Sonne of God, confirme thou, and ſeale theſe things in our harts by thy holie ſpirit powred vpō vs, which may worke within vs vnfeigned righteouſneſſe; that by the ſame thy ſpirit ſhining in the nature which thou tookeſt vpon thee, we may be committed to thee, vpholden, quickened, & brought by thee vnto eternall life: that that league made betweene God and vs, may eternallie be confirmed, and we loued in the beloued; and the eternall Father may loue vs with that loue, wherewith he loueth thee the ſubſtantiall image of himſelfe. Suppreſſe the diuell, that he breake not this woonderfull and profitable peace: and ſuffer vs not hanging on thy necke, running to thine armes, ſeeking thy fauour, to be plucked out of thy hands. Keepe vs, we beſeech in thy lap, as a louing ſhepheard cheriſheth and beareth about his tender lambs.
                           And foraſmuch as the firſt tidings of thy natiuitie were brought by the Angel of the Lord vnto ſhepheards; grant that ſhepheards of the ſoules, that is,

the miniſters and teachers may faithfullie teſtifie thy benefits vnto mankind, and publiſh abroad what they ſee & knowe, ſpreading foorth thy fame, and glorifieng God for the peace, which he hath eternallie concluded with vs; and finallie may bring thy ſheepe to thy ſtall, that is, to the congregation of the faithfull. Open before vs thy ſwadling clouts, which is thy word, that in this life it may crie within vs, and we thereby may feele the ſenſe of thy moſt ſweet promiſes, which thine eternall Father hath vttered of thee; Bleſſed are all they, which put their truſt in him.
                           Furthermore, our petition is, that thou wilt bleſſe vs and our countrie, with all Common-weales. Increaſe among vs dailie ye number of the faithfull; proſper the courſe of the Goſpell, and ſuffer not the light thereof, by the malice of Sathan, to be extinguiſhed. Likewiſe vphold thoſe kingdoms, which miniſter releefe vnto thy Church. Repell from the borders of thy ſeruants the rabblement of Turks & Infidels, which threaten the decaie of thy Church, and deſtruction of kingdoms. Bleſſe the labours of our hands; keepe vs from the contagious diſeaſes: and laſt of all make vs and ours the veſſels of mercie, and profitable inſtruments to thy Church and Common-weale,
                           Amen.
                           Glorie be to God on high.
                        
                        
                           Or thus.
                           
                              ALmightie God, and moſt mercifull Father, who according to the propheſies ſpoken long before, haſt giuen vs thine own Sonne to be conceiued of the holie Ghoſt, and borne of the bleſſed virgin, that in thy nature and ours he might be our holie, and true Emanuel, and Sauior, and Sanctifier of thoſe that truſt in him. Touch our

harts with thy holie ſpirit, that conſidering this ſo great loue of thine, to abaſe thy Sonne to take vpon him the forme of a ſeruant, to make vs ſonnes and heires to thee, that our ſoules may magnifie thee, O Lord our Sauiour, and bleſſe thee the Lord GOD of Iſrael, for thus viſiting and redeeming thy people: and grant vs alſo the fruit of this thy mercie, that by his holineſſe our vncleanneſſe may be done awaie, and our corrupt nature ſanctified by his holie birth and natiuitie; that we putting our truſt in him, may by him be deliuered both from all our ſins, and all our enimies, and attaine to the fruit of this his infinite loue and goodneſſe, euen to ſerue him in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe all the daies of our life, through the ſame thy deere ſonne our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, to whom with thee and the holie Ghoſt, be all praiſe, honour and glorie, for euer and euer,
                           Amen.
                           Glorie be to God on high.
                        
                        
                           Another Meditation of the maruellous incarnation of the word, which is Christ, by whoſe meanes it pleaſed God to helpe mankind fallen from him.
                           
                              BEhold now, O almightie God, the viewer and ſearcher of mine hart. Like as with hart I beleeue (which is counted righteouſneſſe vnto me) ſo with mouth doo I confeſſe before thee (which is to my ſaluation) after what ſort and maner thou didſt vouchſafe in the end of the world to ſuccour and aid mankind. Thou in deed onelie, O God the Father, art not read at anie time or in anie place to be ſent; but of thy Sonne, the Apoſtle ſaith; When that the time was fulfilled, God ſent his Sonne. In that he ſaith (he ſent) he doth ſufficientlie declare, that he being ſent came into this world. When as he being thy Sonne, O our God, and a gentle and kind louer of

mankind, did take vpon him to be the ſeed of Abraham, not of Angels, and ſo taking mans nature, not Angels, did vouchſafe to humble himſelfe to be borne a verie perfect man of bleſſed Marie a pure virgin; and ſo being made like vnto vs in all things, ſinne onlie excepted, (for he was the verie lambe without ſpot that tooke awaie the ſinnes of the world) did appeare and ſhew himſelfe in the ſimilitude of fleſh ſubiect to ſinne, that he might condemne ſinne for ſinne, and that wee might be made the righteouſneſſe in him.
                           But what is that, which he that is the chiefe of the Euangeliſts doth ſaie? He was in the world, and the world was made by him. Thither trulie was he ſent by his humanitie, where he alwaies is, and alwaie hath beene by his diuinitie. The which ſending or embaſſage, I beleeue with all my hart, and confeſſe with my mouth, to be the conſent & worke of all the whole Trinitie. I beleeue alſo, that his manhood being in this my nature, during his infancie, was trobled with creeping and ſcrallings, and was wrapt in cloths after the maner of other children, and was vexed in his youth with labours and troubles. I beleeue, I ſaie, that the Godhead, which was ſent of them, did take vpon him mine humanitie and nature, to the intent he (the Sonne of God) being made man, might cure mine infirmitie, and redeeme the ſinnes of ſinfull man.
                           Therefore doo I bleſſe thy name euerlaſtinglie, and glorifie the ſame with all mine hart, O almightie and mercifull Lord, for that vnſpeakable and maruellous coniunction of Godhead and manhood together, in the vnitie of a perſon: and not after this ſort, that the one ſhould be God, and the other man; but one and the ſame was both God and man, man and God. Neuertheleſſe, although by thy maruellous will the word was made fleſh; yet neither of both the natures was changed into other ſubſtance. In the myſterie of the

Trinitie there is not a fourth perſon added. For the ſubſtance of the word of God and of man was vnited and knit togither; but not confuſed and mixt, that that thing, which was taken of vs, ſhould be turned into God; and that which neuer had been before that time, that is, his fleſh and manhood, ſhould be the ſame that had beene euer without anie beginning, that is, his Godhead.
                           Oh maruellous myſterie! Oh vnſpeakeable fellowſhip! Oh maruellous meekneſſe of the heauenlie mercifulneſſe, which is euer woorthie marueling, and euer to be loued! We were but vile ſeruants; and behold, we are made the ſonnes of God, yea and heires of God togither with Chriſt. From whence came this goodneſſe? And who brought vs to this ſtate? But I require thee, O moſt mercifull Father, by thine ineſtimable pitie, goodneſſe, and charitie to make vs woorthie of theſe manie and great promiſes of the ſame thy ſonne our Lord Ieſu Chriſt. Send foorth thy ſtrength, O God, and eſtabliſh the thing that thou haſt wrought in vs; make perfect that, which thou haſt begun, that we may be able to come vnto the fulneſſe and perfectneſſe of thy pitie. Make vs through the holie Ghoſt to vnderſtand, and through thy ſonne to deſire, and with due honour alwaie to worſhip this great myſterie of thy pitie in Chriſt his bleſſed natiuitie, ſo manifeſt in our fleſh; that as thou haſt giuen vs him, thine onelie begotten Sonne I meane, to take our nature vpon him, and this daie to be borne of a pure virgin: ſo wee being regenerate, and made thy children by adoption and grace, may dailie be renewed by thy holie ſpirit, to glorifie thee from our birth, through the ſame thy deere Sonne, our ſouereigne Lord, and ſweet Sauiour Ieſus; to whom with thee, and the holie Ghoſt, be immortall praiſe and thanks-giuing, now and for euer,
                           Amen.
                        
                        
                           
                           A meditation concerning the true knowledge of Christes incarnation.
                           
                           
                              THE knowledge of the truth is, firſt to knowe thy ſelfe, and to endeuour to be that which thou oughteſt to be, and to amend that which ought to be amended. And ſecondlie to knowe and to loue thy maker and creator, for that is the whole happines of a chriſtian man or woman.
                           See then how vnſpeakable the gratious goodneſſe and entire loue of God towards vs is. He hath created vs of nothing, and giuen vs all that we haue: but alas, foraſmuch as we haue loued the gift more than the giuer, and the creature more than the Creator: therefore we are fallen into the diuels ſnare, and become his bondſlaues. Neuertheles, God being moued with compaſſion, ſent his moſt deere and onlie Sonne to redeeme vs ſlaues, and his holie ſpirit to make vs his ſonnes and daughters againe. He hath giuen his Sonne, I ſaie, euen his beſt beloued child, to be the price of our ranſome; the holie Ghoſt as an aſſurance of his loue; and to be ſhort, he reſerueth himſelfe whole for vs, to be the heritage of our adoption. And ſo almightie God, according to his exceeding gratiouſneſſe and mercie, hath for verie loue and good will to mankind, beſtowed not onlie his benefits, but alſo himſelfe vpon him to recouer him againe; not ſo much to himſelfe, as to him. To the intent that man might bee borne of God, God, I ſaie, was firſt borne of them.
                           O then who is ſo hard-harted, that he will not bee ſoftened by the tender loue of God thus preuenting wretched man, with ſo great, hartie, and vnſpeakable good will, in that he vouchſafed to become man for mans ſake? Yea, who can anie more find in his hart to

hate man or woman, whoſe nature and likeneſſe he or ſhe ſo plainelie ſeeth in the manhood of God? Doubtles, he or ſhe that hateth from hencefoorth a man or a woman, hateth God, and ſo looſeth all his or hir labour, whatſoeuer taken vnder pretence of Chriſtianitie. For God (as is ſaid) became man for mans ſake, that he might be a redeemer as well as a creator; and that man might be ranſomed with his owne goods, and that one man & woman might loue another the more hartilie. God, I ſaie, appeared in the ſhape of a man, to the end that both bodie and ſoule might be made bleſſed, by renewing the eie of the mind in his Godhead, and the eie of the bodie in his manhood; ſo that whether man went in or out, he might find food in him laid vp in ſtore by him in his humane nature. Moſt iniurious therefore is that man or woman to Gods diuinitie, that ſo by hating of their brethren and ſiſters, their owne fleſh, contemne Chriſt, and offend his humanitie.
                        
                        
                           The Thanks-giuing.
                           
                              ILift vp my hart vnto thee, O God; for it is verie meet, right, and my bounden dutie, that I ſhould at all times, & in all places, giue thanks vnto thee, O Lord, holie father, almightie, and euerlaſting God: becauſe thou didſt giue Ieſus Chriſt thine onlie Sonne to be borne as this daie for me and all mankind, who by the operation of the holie Ghoſt was made verie man of the ſubſtance of the bleſſed Uirgin Marie his mother, and that without all ſpot of ſinne, to make vs cleane from all ſinne. Therefore, with Angels and Archangels, and with all the holie companie of Saincts and Uirgins in heauen, I laud and magnifie thy glorious name: euermore praiſing thee, and ſaieng, Holie, Holie,

Holie, Lord God of hoſtes, heauen and earth are full of thy glorie: Glorie be to thee, O Lord, moſt high,
                           Amen.
                        
                     
                     
                        3. On Newyeares daie. Of Christ his circumciſion in the flesh.
                        
                        
                           The Preface.
                           
                              CIrcumciſe the foreſkin of your hart, and be no more ſtiffenecked. Deuter. 18.
                           Be ye circumciſed in the Lord, I ſaie, and cut awaie the foreſkin of your hart, and euill affections, all ye inhabitants of Iuda and Ieruſalem. Iere. 4.
                           For the circumciſion of the hart, which conſiſteth in the ſpirit, and not in the letter, is the true circumciſion, whoſe praiſe is not of men, but of God. Rom. 4.
                           Yea we are the circumciſion, which worſhip God in the ſpirit, and reioice in Chriſt Ieſus, and haue no confidence in the fleſh. Philip. 3.
                           For circumciſion verelie auaileth, if thou keepe the lawe; but if thou be a breaker of the ordinances of the lawe, thy circumciſion is made vncircumciſion, &c. Rom. 2.
                           Oh that my waies were made ſo direct, that I might keepe thy ſtatutes, ſo ſhall I not be confounded! Order my ſteps in thy word, and ſo ſhall no wickedneſſe haue dominion ouer me.
                           I will keepe thy ceremonies, O forſake me not vtterlie. Halleluiah.
                           
                        
                        
                           The Praier.
                           
                              
                                 O
                               Lord Ieſus Chriſt, Sonne of the liuing God, we thanke thee, foraſmuch as after thy decree concerning the redemption of mankind, from the beginning thou haſt beene preſent with thy Church outwardlie

by ſpeaking vnto hir by thy miniſters, and inwardlie by kindling thy light and righteouſneſſe in the harts of the faithfull. Thou haſt ratified thy promiſes by outward ſignes and ceremonies, whereby euerie man may applie the benefits vnto himſelfe. So did thy burnt offerings and ſacrifices teſtifie of thee, which afterwards ſhould be ſlaine. The flames of fire, which from heauen did ſet on fire the offerings, did witneſſe of thy preſence, that as manie as ſhould behold thy benefits with a true faith, thou wouldeſt quicken with the ſacrifice of thine holie ſpirit, which inflameth true knowledge and good motions within the godlie.
                           That life was giuen to them of thy meere mercie, the firſt parents did knowe full well, when it was ſaid, that a woman ſhall bring foorth. And becauſe the mediator was called that ſeed of the woman, and withall, promiſed to be the ſubduer of Sathan, they knew that he ſhould be both God and man. The ſame promiſe was repeated vnto Abraham, the father of the faithfull. And foraſmuch as reſtraint was made vnto a certaine nation, thou didſt adde a new rite of circumciſion, whereby not onelie the poſteritie of Abraham was diſcerned from other nations, but alſo it was a teſtimonie admoniſhing of the ſeed to come, which was Chriſt, who ſhould take our weake fleſh vpon him, and beare our nature, and bring both Iewes and Gentils vnto eternall felicitie.
                           Wherefore, we yeeld thee humble thanks, foraſmuch as hitherto thou haſt continued this ſound of thy perſon and office, notwithſtanding the great raging of thine enimies: for appearing at the length in the fleſh, for giuing thy ſelfe vnto vs for a Newyeares gift of ineſtimable price, for being made vnder the lawe, & a curſſe to ſaue vs wretches from the curſſe of the lawe, and to reſtore vs vnto innocencie loſt through ſinne. For which cauſe, thy bleſſed will was, as vpon

this daie to be circumciſed in the fleſh, and now firſt of all to ſhead thy pretious bloud for vs that are of vncircumciſed harts and lips, and all to ſhew that thou cameſt in deede of the verie ſeed of Abraham, and waſt ſubiect to the lawe, curſſe, and condemnation for vs; and that our corrupt nature, by thy holineſſe might be ſanctified, and haue through thee, an obedience to anſwere the ſame withall.
                           We beſeech thee therefore, grant vs the true circumciſion of the ſpirit, that our harts & all our members being mortified from all worldlie and carnall luſts, we may in all things obeie thy bleſſed will, and heere ſtaie our ſelues, and put our truſt in thee, that thus haſt humbled thy ſelfe ſo lowe for vs, that we may be exalted by thee. And from our harts we praie thee ioine vs to that holie companie, that did wait for thy redemption before it came, and doo reioice in it now it is come and performed, and with the ſacred hoſt of Angels to giue all glorie & renowme vnto thee, for bringing thy peace, which paſſeth all vnderſtanding, vpon the earth, and declaring ſo great kindneſſe and good will towards vs, as to giue thy ſelfe, and thereby euerlaſting ioie and bliſſe for a Newyeares gift of worthie memoriall, and ineſtimable value, to be our owne for euer and euer.
                           Speake hencefoorth to our harts with thy louelie voice. Lighten the lampe of our minds with thy heauenlie knowledge. Confirme vs with thy bleſſed Sacraments, which are the certaine tokens of thine vndoubted regeneration and quickning of vs. Oh take awaie the curſſe, the wrath of God, damnation, the works of the fleſh and the diuell. Grant me, I beſeech thee, that thy grace may dailie mortifie my concupiſcence of pleaſures in things of this world, that is, of wealth, riches, glorie, libertie, fauour of men, meates, drinks, apparell, eaſe, yea and life it ſelfe: that the

horror and impatiencie of more greeuous things may be weakened, and I accuſtome my ſelfe to denie my will in more eaſie and pleaſant things of this life, and for euer become obedient and readie in all Chriſtian patience, to doo thy good will in all things, hartilie and willinglie to ſerue thee, and doo whatſoeuer may pleaſe thee.
                           Make me, I ſaie, through the effectuall power of thy grace and holie ſpirit working in me moſt miſerable wretch, to hate, abhor, flie, and ſubdue all adulterie, whoredome, vncleanneſſe, vnnaturall luſts, euill concupiſcence, inordinate deſires, wantonnes, tendernes, delicatenes, idlenes, dronkennes, gluttonie, ſlothfulnes, diſtruſt, deſpaire, ignorance, weakenes, wilfulnes, idolatrie, ſuperſtition, hypocriſie, hereſie, error, ſects, variance, ſtrife, wrath, enuie, ſlanders, lieng, ſwearing, curſſing, vaine-glorie, pride, couetouſnes, theft, deceit, flatterie; and whatſoeuer elſe, O Lord, fighteth or rebelleth againſt thy holie ſpirit. And ſtrengthen me ſo with thy might, that I may not onlie drawe all theſe mine earthlie members and horrible vices before rehearſed, vnder my feet; but alſo fight continuallie againſt them, & ſubdue them, ſo that they may all turne to the beſt for me, as meet matter whereon I may exerciſe my faith, powre foorth hartie praier, and giue thee moſt hartie thanks for victorie. Finallie, worke in me thy bleſſing, with all the fruits of the ſpirit, righteouſnes, peace, loue, ioie in the holie Ghoſt, long-ſuffering, gentlenes, goodnes, faithfulnes, meekenes, temperance, ſtrength, patience, and ſuch like. Grant vs the remiſſion of our ſinnes, righteouſnes and life. Reſtore in our minds thy lawe, and begin ſuch a new conformitie, this new yeare in this our life and conuerſation, as may be perfect in the life to come. Be thou our ſauiour by thy power and merit, that in our minds we may perceiue that thy Father is at

peace with vs through thy death, and find thee dwelling within vs to eternall life and happineſſe,
                           Amen.

                        4. On the Epiphanie, or twelfe daie. Of the apparition of Christ, and the three Kings, and their offerings to Chriſt.
                           
                        
                        
                           The Preface.
                           
                              GET thee vp beetimes, and be bright, O daughter Ieruſalem. For thy light commeth, and the glorie of the Lord is riſen vpon thee.
                           Lift vp thine eies, & looke round about thee. For behold the Gentiles ſhall come to thy light, and kings to the brightneſſe that ſpringeth foorth vpon thee.
                           The multitude of camels and dromedaries that bring the riches of the Gentiles ſhall couer thee: all they of Saba, Mada, and Epha ſhall come bringing gold, incenſe, and ſhewing foorth the praiſe of the Lord.
                           All theſe gather themſelues and come to thee: thy ſonnes ſhall come vnto thee from farre, and thy daughters ſhall gather themſelues to thee on euerie ſide, frō the eaſt, and from the weſt.
                           The iſles alſo ſhall wait for me, and ſpeciallie the ſhips of Tharſis, that they may bring thy ſonnes and daughters from farre, and their ſiluer and their gold with them, vnto the name of the Lord thy God, vnto the holie one of Iſrael that hath glorified thee.
                           Strangers ſhall build vp thy wals, and their kings ſhall doo thee ſeruice; yea kings, princes, and the hoſt of the Gentils ſhall ſee and ariſe, and worſhip thee. For I haue made thee the light of the Gentiles, that thou maiſt be my health vnto the end of the world.
                           Thou ſhalt ſuck the milke of the Gentils, and kings breſts ſhall feed thee: kings, I ſaie, ſhall be thy nurſing

fathers, and Queenes ſhall be thy nurſing mothers.
                           And thoſe ſhall come kneeling vnto thee that haue vexed thee, and all they that deſpiſe thee ſhall fall at thy feet before thee, with their faces flat vpon the earth, and licke vp the duſt of thy feet.
                           Yea, euerie people and kingdome that ſerueth not thee ſhall periſh, and be deſtroied with vtter deſtruction, and thou ſhalt knowe that I am the Lord, the Sauiour and Redeemer, euen the mightie one of Iacob: and that whoſoeuer putteth his truſt in me ſhall not be confounded.
                           They that dwell in the wildernes, I ſaie, ſhall kneele before the Kings ſonne: his enimies ſhall licke the duſt.
                           The king of Tharſis and of the iſles, ſhall giue preſents; the kings of Arabia & Saba ſhall bring gifts.
                           All kings ſhall fall downe before him: all nations ſhall doo him ſeruice.
                           He ſhall liue, and vnto him ſhall be giuen the gold of Arabia.
                           Praier ſhall be made euer vnto him, and dailie ſhall he be praiſed.
                           The Lord declared his ſaluation, his righteouſneſſe hath he openlie ſhewed in the ſight of the heathen.
                           All the world ſhall worſhip thee, O God; ſing of thee, and praiſe thy name moſt high.
                           The Lord is King, the earth may be glad thereof; yea the multitude of iſles may reioice and bee glad thereof.
                           Bring therefore vnto the Lord, O ye mightie: bring preſents and gifts vnto the Lord, O ye kindreds and nations of the world. Come, I ſaie, into his courts with praiſe, and ſpeake good of his name.
                           Aſcribe vnto the Lord, onelie the ſtrength, power, kingdome and glorie: worſhip God, I ſaie, O ye gods, kings, iudges, and rulers of the earth: worſhip him with an holie worſhip, and giue him the honor due vnto

his name. O make his praiſes to be glorious in your liues and conuerſation. For he it is that hath exalted you, and is himſelfe exalted farre aboue all gods, and his praiſe and glorie is aboue heauen and earth. Halleluiah.
                           
                        
                        
                           The Praier.
                           
                              OEternall God, Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, which after a woonderfull maner reuealedſt thy ſelfe at the baptiſme of Chriſt ſtanding in the water of Iordan, at ſuch time as thou diddeſt teſtifie of thy ſonne; and the holie Ghoſt appeared in the likeneſſe of a dooue: gouerne vs by thine holie ſpirit, that in true faith we may obeie thee; kindle in our minds a true knowledge of thy benefits; bring to paſſe, that approching vnto thee in our praiers we may diſcerne thee, the true God, aboue all feined gods, & in mind turne our ſelues into that banke of the water, into the companie of thoſe godlie auditors and beholders, before whom this noble appearing was made. Speake vnto vs by thy ſonne in the holie Ghoſt, and turne vs vnto true obedience. And as thou broughteſt godlie auditors vnto the ſight of Chriſt, which taking our fleſh vpon him became our mediatour; and thou eternall Father ſpakeſt out of the cloud, and the holie Ghoſt appeared in the likenes of a dooue: ſo bring to paſſe, that in this life we may depend vpon the benefit of thy ſoone, which coupled our nature vnto his, to make an eternall couenant with vs. Cauſe the heauens in like maner to be opened vnto vs, that we may heare thy voice, and thy ſpirit reſt vpon vs. Worke in vs the beginning of eternall life, vntill in thy viſible preſence we ſhall be hold thy diuinivntill in the heauens, not darklie and in a cloud; but face

to face, beeing made like thy ſonne.
                           And as thoſe Chriſtian Magicians or Philoſophers of Perſia, ſome remnants of the ſchoole of Daniel, by the conduct and leading of a ſtarre, came from farre to ſee thee, and gaue a notable teſtimonie of the birth of Chriſt Ieſus our Sauiour: ſo mainteine euermore for thine owne glorie ſake, ſome congregation, which may ſet foorth and celebrate thy benefits. Grant that that luckie ſtarre, the light of faith, may riſe vnto vs, which ſeeketh thee in Bethlem in a manger, in thy word reuealed in the miniſterie, that we wander not from the right waie, neither ſeeke fained bywaies of humane opinions & ſeruice. Suffer not the lampe of thy light to be extinguiſhed, either by the darkenes of hypocrites and idolaters, or by the rage of tyrants, which wage mortall battell againſt thee: but grant, that endued with new light from thee the true Sunne of righteouſneſſe, we may reioice from our whole harts, and acknowledge thee to bee our captaine, which wilt gouerne thy people in truth and equitie. Let the light of thy grace, I ſaie, lighten the darkenes of our conſcience, O mercifull Ieſu, our true & bright loade-ſtar of the world; and by thy ioifull apparition, giue vnto vs the full knowledge both of thy ſelfe, and of our owne ſelues, that within we may ſee thee, and inwardlie find thee, and that there we may continuallie offer vnto thy holie Maieſtie, the mirrh of ſincere faith, and inward contrition, and the frankincenſe of deuout praier and inuocation, and the gold of loue, righteouſnes, and patience in trouble; and ſo aſcribing vnto thee the honour of a King, and the ſeruice due vnto God, may ſhew all true liberalitie with the godlie, both vnto thee, and thy poore Church, and beare ſufficient teſtimonie to the world of thy kingdome, diuinitie, prieſthood, humanitie, croſſe, death, and buriall, and take hold of the manifold benefits thereof, and outwardlie

alſo may in our places, office and calling, helpe to mainteine thy miniſterie, to the vttermoſt of our power. And grant that as thou (after thou hadſt reuealed and manifeſted thy ſelfe vnto the three wiſe men, by the leading of a ſtarre) cauſedſt them to returne another waie into their owne countrie: ſo wee, (which by the waie of darkenes and offences haue retired and gone backe from the ſupernall countrie of bleſſednes, thou, the bright daie-ſtar of the world beeing our guide) may returne vnto the ſame by the waie of truth and grace; and that now knowing thee by faith, when we depart out of this life, wee may bee brought into that kingdome, where thy diuinitie ſhall ſhine without miſts or myſteries, and there haue the fruition of thy glorious Godhead, and woorſhip thee, and praiſe thee for euer and euer,
                           Amen.

                              LEt the Bridegroome come forth of his chamber, and the Bride out of hir cloſet, and let all ſinners weepe before the Lord, & ſaie: Turne thou vs, O good Lord, and ſo ſhall we be turned. Be fauorable O Lord, be fauorable to thy people, & ſpare vs, which rent our harts & not our garments, & turne to thee in faſting, weeping & praieng. For thou art a mercifull God, full of compaſſion, long ſuffering, and of great pitie. Thou ſpareſt, when we deſerue puniſhment, and in thy wrath thinkeſt vpon mercie. Oh ſpare thy people, good Lord; ſpare them, and let not thine heritage be brought to confuſion. Heare vs, O Lord; for thy mercie is great, and after the multitude of thy mercies looke vpon vs. Haue mercie vpon vs, O God, haue mercie vpon vs miſerable ſinners.
                           ¶ Heere ſaie the ſeuen penitentiall Pſalmes following, and other praiers, for contrition and repentance, as you thinke good.

                              O Lord God Ieſus Chriſt, our onlie redeemer, which tookeſt vpon thee our ſinfull fleſh, and liuedſt therein a life moſt holie in all righteouſnes for our example, and didſt through the power of thy Godhead and diuine nature, moſt reuerentlie obeie in all things the will of thine heauenlie Father, with ſubduing in this fleſh, with great triumph, glorie and maieſtie, the power of the diuell, the world, and the fleſh; that onlie in thee, the ſpirit of ſanctification might myraculouſlie appeere, and beare ſwaie with fulneſſe in the ſight of all fleſh, during the courſe of this life, and for euer after to remaine with power in glorie, verie God with verie God, in the kingdome of God the Father. We beſeech thee moſt humblie, O Lord Ieſu, which hateſt nothing that thou haſt made, and dooeſt forgiue the ſinnes of all them that be penitent, to haue compaſſion vpon vs in our weakeneſſe and infirmitie; that as thou haſt for our ſafetie taken upon thee our fleſh, and for our ſakes didſt faſt fortie daies and fortie nights, and haſt diuerſlie in thine owne perſon felt as a man, the fraile ſtate of our mortall nature, and how inclinable it is without thy diuine power, to fall from the obedience of thy will that is heauenlie, to the ſuggeſtions of ſathan the old enimie, and to the allurements of things earthlie, vaine and tranſitorie. So we beſeech thee, O our God, to grant vnto vs thine holie ſpirit, that by the ſtrength thereof in vs proceeding from thee, we may in our weakeneſſe haue power, that our enimie may be reſiſted, the world defied, the fleſh vanquiſhed, and our ſpirit quickened; whereby we may moſt gladlie obeie thy godlie will, and turne vnto thee with all our hearts,

both in vnfeigned repentance, in hartie contrition, and earneſt confeſſion, and alſo in true faſting, in competent feeding, in faithfull praieng, in charitable dealing, in chaſt looking, in reuerent beholding, in godlie hearing, in fruitefull ſpeaking, in holie thinking, free from flattering, void of detraction, ſlander, lieng, falſe accuſation, blaſphemie, outfacing, idle talke, or filthie communication, and to tread ſteadilie in all things the ſteps of true holines before thee, as thou haſt moſt gratiouſlie lead vs, and taught vs the waie, that with all ſimplicitie, both outwardlie and inwardlie in bodie and ſoule, and in all parts and members of them, our faſt this Lent and euer may not be prophane, earthlie, hypocritiſh, ſuperſtitious, or carnall, to the view of the world; but holie, heauenlie, and ſpirituall to thee. Giue vs grace, I ſaie, not ſo much to abſteine from meates, as from ill manners; nor from fleſh, as from filthie cogitations. For as thou, O God, wilt be worſhipped in ſpirit and truth; ſo the ſpirituall faſt it is which pleaſeth thee. Suffer vs not, gratious God, to abuſe thy good creatures immoderatelie, to the hurt both of our bodies and ſoules, but temperatlie, the better to ſerue thee, and as ſoberlie to take our food, ſo carefullie to abſteine from ſinne. For otherwiſe, to abſteine from meate, and not to refraine from pride, couetouſnes, concupiſcence, lewdnes, and ſuch like vices, it ſhall but hurt our bodies through an hypocriticall abſtinence, and caſt awaie our ſoules through our exceeding impietie. Aſſiſt vs with thy ſecret grace therefore, we beſeech thee, to vſe ſuch abſtinence, that our fleſh being ſubdued to the ſpirit, we may euer obeie thy godlie motions in righteouſnes and true holines, to our reioicing with peace of conſcience; and that obteining of thee the God of all mercie, perfect remiſſion and forgiuenes, with aboundance of thy grace, we may ſhew foorth fruitfullie thy glorie all the daies

of our liues, and after this life ended, reigne with thee for euer, in thy glorious kingdome, where all holy folke doo reſt, and which by thy bleſſed natiuitie, holie circumciſion, faſting, temptation, croſſe, death & paſſion, thou haſt alone ſo deerelie purchaſed for vs, to the perpetuall praiſe of thine eternall name,
                           Amen.
                           I haue ſinned, I haue ſinned, haue mercie vpon me.
                        
                     
                     
                        6. On the firſt Sundaie in Lent. Of Christ his temptation in the wilderneſſe, and moſt glorious conqueſt ouer Sathan.
                           
                        
                        
                           The Preface.
                           
                              MY ſonne, if thou wilt come into the ſeruice of God, ſtand faſt in righteouſneſſe and feare, and prepare thy ſoule to temptation, for he that is not tempted, what is he?
                           Remember alwaie the Lord thy God, which lead thee fortie yeares in the wildernes for to humble thee, and to prooue thee, and to knowe what was in thine hart, whether thou wouldeſt keepe his commandements or no.
                           He humbled thee, and ſuffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with Manna, which neither thou nor thy fathers knew of, to make thee knowe that a man doth not liue by bread onlie, but by euerie word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord, doth a man liue.
                           To daie therefore if you will heare his voice, harden not your harts, as in the prouocation, and as in the daie of temptation in the wilderneſſe, when your fathers tempted me, prooued me, and ſawe my works.
                           Fortie yeares long was I greeued with this generation, and ſaid; It is a people that doo erre in their harts, for they haue not knowne my waies: vnto whome I ſware in my wrath, that they ſhould not enter into my reſt.
                           
                              
Examine me, O Lord, and prooue me; trie out my reines and my hart. For thy louing kindnes is euer before mine eies, and I will walke in thy truth. I haue ſinned, haue mercie vpon me.
                        
                        
                           The Praier.
                           
                              THE cauſe of thine appeering in the fleſh, O Sonne of God, Lord and Sauiour Chriſt, was to deſtroie the works of ſathan, which our firſt parents did. The diuell, through hatred of thee, and of thine eternall father, encountred in viſible forme. He ſoaked into their minds certaine ſuſpicions and doubtings of thy will, and pricked them on, with a deſire of a more excellent nature, being themſelues of all the creatures the moſt excellent. He tickled them with the ſpurre of pride and ambition, and ſo by his ſubtiltie caried them headlong with himſelfe, being withdrawne from thee, into the bottomles pit of eternall deſtruction. But thou incenſed againſt him, through the infinite and vnſpeakable good will, which thou beareſt to mankind, tookeſt vs miſerable wretches out of the inſatiable iawes of our mortall enimie; and in thy fleſh at length, when he dreaded not to aſſaile thee our Captaine, thou putteſt him to a ſhamefull flight, and draueſt him from thee and thine: ſo that at anie time, through thy ſmall aſſiſtance, we may both repell him, and preuaile againſt his fierce aſſalts of temptations.
                           Unto thee, O almightie God, and victorious Captaine, with godlie groanes doo we crie, requiring at thy mercifull hands to be made of the number of thy celeſtiall ſouldiers, parteners of thy glorious victorie, and enioiers of thy happines. Arme vs with thy heauenlie armour, that is, with the knowledge of thy

word and ſpirituall conſolations, whereby we may bee able to repell the firie darts of that foule feend.
                           Againſt thy Church in all ages hath this enimie of thine ſet himſelfe, and brought theſe engins to their ouerthrowe, which he vſed againſt thine owne perſon, at ſuch time as thou wenteſt from thy baptiſme to preaching, knowing that thy proſperitie would be his decaie; and yet through the will of God, did not acknowledge thee to be the Meſſias. He troubled thee, beeing in the wildernes without worldlie power, aid, wealth and riches; with horrible cogitations did he vexe thy ſoule, and troubled thy hart with greefe vnſpeakable. At this time thy Church lieth in the wilderneſſe, poorelie and miſerablie doth ſhe lie oppreſſed with wrongfull iniuries, and mightie troubles. He laugheth thereat, derideth the Saincts ſtanding vnder the croſſe, he bids ſtones to be made bread, he contemneth their miſerie, and caſteth in their teeth the glorie and wealth of his kingdome. Aſſiſt vs, that in theſe temptations we may laie hold of the armour of proofe, and behold this noble anſwere of thine, Man liueth not by bread onlie.
                           
                           We knowledge thee, with the euerliuing Father and the holie Ghoſt, to be a true and almightie God, giuing vs the bread of life, and ſo ordeining, that with corporall things we are fed and ſuſteined in this life, O eternall Father, which knoweſt what we need, and alone canſt giue a reaſon, why after this manner thou wilt feed vs, and not as thou dooeſt the ſtarres without corporall things. Giue vnto the Church of thy wiſedome ſuch things as are neceſſarie for the ſuſtentation of this life, wherein the ioies of the life eternall and to come doth begin. And albeit ſometimes we lacke diuers things, although thine aduerſarie throweth ſtones at vs for bread; yet by thy power ſtrengthen vs that we faint not. Thou art our maker, wee

are thy workemanſhip. In thy hands is the whole frame of this world. We liue not by bread alone, or by our owne induſtrie, neither art thou tied with a fatall chaine of ſecond cauſes, but by thy decree, by thy will doo we breath, in thee we liue, moue, and haue our beeing. At thy commandement we take life, and when thou biddeſt, we leaue this world.
                           Wherefore, if ſo it pleaſe thee, we ſhall liue as doo the birds of the aire, which haue no protection, or as the child in the mothers wombe, which knoweth not how he liueth. And as he, albeit lieng in great darkenes, and couered in ſecret parts, receiueth nouriſhment after a maruellous manner from his mother, and at length by the courſe of nature commeth ſafe and ſound into this world: ſo we, notwithſtanding our liuing in palpable darkenes of this life, and wrapped in the miſeries of this world, among the packe of thine enimies, yet armed with thy word and promiſe, doo receiue comfort thereby, and are protected by thee after a woonderfull ſort, and at length truſt to be deliuered out of this bodie of ſinne, and to come to a better life, which neuer ſhall haue end. For we are not made to liue alwaies in this world in miſerie, but thou haſt prepared a more glorious life for thy ſeruants, the ſweetnes whereof beginneth in this world. Thy word is our life, O eternall Father. Thy Sonne is the word ſpeaking to vs both inwardlie and outwardlie. Outwardlie by his miniſters he vttereth from thy boſome thy will and commandements, and inwardlie he ſpeaketh to our ſoules, raiſing vp godlie cogitations and manners pleaſing thee; ſo that a double life is reſerued for vs, to wit, a corporall and a ſpirituall, not through bread, not through our owne merits, but through thy will reuealed by thy Sonne.
                           Furthermore, forſomuch as ſathan vſeth another kind of weapon to the deſtruction of the godlie, when

thy Church enioieth quietnes and peace, by ſtirring of excellent & good wits, and teachers armed with publike authoritie, vnto curioſitie and ambition, whereby through enuie and hatred, vaine contentions are mooued, famous men caſt themſelues from the pinacle of the Temple, and hereſies doo ariſe: we humblie beſeech thee in this reſpect alſo, becauſe it is more hurtfull than the former ſubtiltie of ſathan, repreſſe thine enimie which corrupteth thy word, and vſeth the ſame for the confirmation of damnable opinions. Quench all the flames of ambition, pride and curioſitie. Leade vs not into temptation, neither ſuffer vs to tempt thee, to contend with thee through pride, in ſetting our owne wiſedome and ſubtiltie againſt thee, which was the ouerthrowe of our firſt parents. Suffer vs not to forſake thy word, neither permit that fowle and lieng ſpirit to falſifie the ſame in vs; but make vs conſtantlie to reſt vpon thy promiſe, as to a ſacred and ſure anchor, ſetting it againſt all the motions of curioſitie and pride.
                           Laſt of all, remoue from vs that horrible torment of idolatrie. The world at this daie is wrapped in idle ſeruice, yea vnwittinglie the whole world is full of idols, to the great diſhonor of thy name. Fained gods are erected, ſuperſtitious inuocations are confirmed, idolaters ſwimme in wealth and rule the roſt, thy glorie is defaced, thy maieſtie blaſphemed, the diuell rageth and reigneth, he giueth kingdomes, and diſpoſeth the goods of this world, if his words be true, as he lieth ſhamefullie. For thou it is, and thou alone, which altereſt Empires, and confirmeſt them at thy pleaſure. If order be obſerued, thou cauſeſt it, but all miſorder is raiſed by the diuell, for the which he ſhall be puniſhed of thee with paines eternall.
                           Wherefore haue mercie on vs, O God, haue mercie on vs; deliuer vs from the thicke mud of idolatrie;

make vs to lift vp our eies vnto thee the ſonne of glorie, that abhorring all feined ſeruice and ceremonies contrarie to thy word, wee may acknowledge, ſerue, and ſanctifie thee the true God, Father, Sonne, and holie Ghoſt, which by and for thy Sonne dooeſt deliuer vs from the power of Sathan, and make vs heires of thine euerlaſting kingdome, which alone knoweſt the harts and grones of all creatures, which onlie wilt be called vpon in the name of thy Sonne, and heare vs onelie for his ſake. Wherefore vnto thee, O our God and Iehoua, doo we ſpeake; thee onelie through thine; aſſiſtance will we ſerue, and neuer giue thy glorie to another. Take vp that impudent theefe Satan, which would ſteale awaie thine honour; baniſh him far from thy Church. But gard both our bodies & ſoules with the gard of thine holie Angels, which may pitch their tents about vs, and encounter with Sathan, which beſetteth vs on all ſides. Deliuer vs out of his hands from all miſeries of this life, and laſt of all paſſing out of this world, carie our ſoules vnto the ſocietie of thy Saints in life eternall,
                           Amen.
                           I haue ſinned; I haue ſinned; haue mercie vpon me.
                        
                        
                           Of the Diuel, and his manifold temptations.
                           
                           
                              THere wanted a tempter, and thou wert the cauſe that he was wanting: there wanted time and place, and thou wert the cauſe that they wanted: the tempter was preſent, and there wanted neither place nor time; but thou holdeſt me backe that I ſhould not conſent. The tempter came full of darkneſſe as he is, and thou didſt harden me that I might deſpiſe him. The tempter came armed and ſtronglie; but to the intent he ſhould

not ouercome me, thou didſt reſtraine him, and ſtrengthen me. The tempter came tranſformed into an Angel of light; and to the intent he ſhould not deceiue me, thou diddeſt rebuke him; and to the intent I ſhould knowe him, thou diddeſt inlighten me.
                           For he is that great red dragon, and that old ſerpent, called the diuell and Sathan, which hath ſeuen heads, and ten horns, whom thou haſt created to take his pleaſure in this huge and broad ſea, wherein there creepe liuing wights innumerable, and beaſts great and ſmall: that is to ſaie, diuers ſorts of fiends, which practiſe nothing elſe daie nor night, but to go about ſeeking whom they may deuoure, except thou reſcue him. For it is that old dragon, which was bred in the paradiſe of pleaſure, which draweth downe the third part of the ſtarres of heauen with his taile, and caſts them to the ground; which with his venem poiſoneth the waters of the earth, that as manie men as drinke of them may die; which triumpheth vpon gold as if it were mire; and is of opinion, that Iordan ſhall runne into his mouth: and which is made of ſuch a mould as he feareth no man.
                           And who ſhall ſaue vs from his chaps? Who ſhall plucke vs out of his mouth, ſauing thou, O Lord, who haſt broken the heads of the great dragon? Helpe vs, Lord: ſpread out thy wings ouer vs, O Lord, that we may flie vnder them from the face of this dragon that purſueth vs; and fence thou vs from his hornes with thy ſheeld. For his continuall endeuour and onelie deſire is, to deuoure the ſoules which thou haſt created. And therefore we crie vnto thee our God, deliuer vs from our dailie aduerſarie, who whether we ſleepe or wake; whether we eate or drinke; or whether wee be dooing anie thing elſe, preſſeth vpon vs by all kind of meanes; aſſaulting vs daie and night with traines and policies, and ſhooting his venemous arrowes at

vs, ſometime openlie, and ſomtime priuilie, to ſlea our ſoules: and yet are we moſt lewdlie ouerſeene, O Lord, in that whereas we ſee the dragon continuallie in a readines, to deuoure vs with open mouth: we neuertheleſſe doo ſleepe and riot in our owne ſlothfulneſſe, as though we were out of his danger, who deſireth nothing elſe, but to deſtroie vs.
                           Our enimie, to the intent to kill vs, watcheth continuallie, and neuer ſleepeth, and yet will not we wake from ſleepe to ſaue our ſelues. Behold, he hath pitched infinite ſnares before our feet, and filled all our waies with ſundrie traps, to catch our ſoules. And who can eſcape them? He hath laid ſnares for vs in our riches; he hath laid ſnares in our pouerty; he hath laid ſnares in our meate, in our drinke, in our pleaſures, in our ſleepe, and in our waking: he hath ſet ſnares for vs in our words, and in our works, and in all our life; but Lord, deliuer vs from the net of the fowlers, and from hard words, that we may giue praiſe to thee, ſaieng: Bleſſed be the Lord, who hath not giuen vs vp to be torne with their teeth. Our ſoule is deliuered, as a ſparowe out of the net of the fowler; the net is broken, and we be eſcaped.
                        
                        
                           Againſt the temptation of Sathan, praie thus:
                           
                           
                              
                                 O
                               Lord Ieſu Chriſt, the onlie ſtaie and fence of our mortall ſtate; our onlie hope, our onlie ſaluation, our glorie, and our triumph: who in the fleſh, (which thou hadſt for our only cauſe taken vpon thee) didſt ſuffer thy ſelfe to be tempted of Sathan, and who onlie and alone of all men diddeſt vtterlie ouercome and vanquiſh ſinne, death, the world, the diuell, and all the kingdome of hell; & whatſoeuer

thou haſt ſo ouercommed, for our behalfe it is, that thou haſt ouercommed it; neither hath it been thy will to haue anie of thy ſeruants keepe battell and fight with anie of the foreſaid euils, but of purpoſe to reward vs with a crowne of the more glorie for it; and to the intent that thou mighteſt likewiſe ouercome ſathan in thy members, as thou haſt afore done in thine owne perſon. Giue thou, we beſeech thee, vnto vs thy ſouldiers, O Lion moſt victorious of the tribe of Iuda, ſtrength againſt the roring Lion, which continuallie wandereth to and fro, ſeeking whome he may deuour. Thou being that ſame Serpent, the true giuer of health and life, that was nailed on high vpon a tree, giue vnto thy little ſeelie ones, wilineſſe againſt the deceiptfull awaitings of the moſt ſubtil ſerpent. Thou being a Lambe as white as ſnowe, the vanquiſher of ſathans tyrannie, giue vs thy little ſheepe the ſtrength and vertue of thy ſpirit, that being in our owne ſelues weake and feeble, and in thee ſtrong and valiant, wee may withſtand and ouercome all aſſaults of the diuell, ſo that our ghoſtlie enimie may not glorie ouer vs: but being conquerours through thee, we may giue thanks to thy mercie, which neuer leaueſt them deſtitute that put their truſt in thee, who liueſt and reigneſt God for euermore, world without end,
                           Amen.
                        
                     
                     
                        7. On Thurſedaie next before Eaſter, commonlie called Maundie Thurſedaie. Of Chriſt his laſt feaſt or inſtitution of the Sacrament of the Supper, and of his great humilitie in waſhing his diſciples feet afterward.
                        
                        
                           The Preface.
                           
                              
                                 I
                               (Saith Wiſedome) haue killed my victuals, drawne my wine, and prepared my table.
                           Come now vnto me all ye poore in ſpirit, that are emptie and an hungred: come ye

fat and rich alſo vpon earth, that go aſtraie and faint for thirſt.
                           Come, I ſaie, O freends, eate of my meate woorthilie, and worſhip me: drinke of my wine purelie, and glorifie me. Make ye merrie at my table holilie, and praiſe me O welbeloued.
                           For it is I that ſatiſfie the mouth with good things, and fill the hungrie ſoule with ſpirituall deinties.
                           Yea my fleſh is meate in deed, and my bloud is drinke in deed, which I haue prouided for my people, and he that eateth me, euen he ſhall liue by me.
                           Happie and bleſſed therefore are they that are called to the Lambs ſupper: for they ſhall eate Manna, euen Angels food, in the kingdome of heauen.
                           Lord bid me vnto this feaſt, and grant that I may ſup with thee, and thou with me.
                           Lord waſh not my feet onlie, but my hands and head alſo: for I am altogither vncleane; and if thou waſh me not, I ſhall remaine filthie ſtill.
                           O waſh me therefore throughlie from my wickednes, and cleanſe me from my ſecret faults, and purge me from my preſumptuous ſinnes.
                           For I haue ſinned, I haue offended, oh forgiue me, and haue mercie on me.

                                 O
                               Bleſſed Sauiour, and deere Redeemer Ieſu Chriſt, which in the holie myſterie of thy laſt Supper, with thine Apoſtles, didſt deliuer thy bleſſed bodie and bloud vnder the forme of bread & wine; and ordeinedſt, that as thy bodie was broken, and thy bloud ſhead for vs, ſo we ſhould thankefullie celebrate and keepe a ſolemne memorie of thy death, till thou come. Grant vs, we beſeech thee, euer

ſtedfaſtlie to beleeue, and kindlie to acknowledge thine infinite and almightie power, thine incomprehenſible loue towards vs, and that we may alwaie worthilie receiue the ſame bleſſed Sacrament, according to thy holie ordinance, that thereby we may obtaine increaſe of all goodnes, in vnitie of ſpirit with thee our head, and by thee and thy ſpirit, with all the companie of them that be trulie thine, which be thy ſpirituall and myſticall bodie, and our ſpirituall and Chriſtian brethren and ſiſters.
                           Suffer vs not alſo, we beſeech thee, to fall into anie ſlothfull and careleſſe negligence, whereby we ſhould vnkindlie forget ſo ineſtimable a benefit; but rather at all occaſions, with minds woorthilie prepared for ſo holie an action, thankefullie to renew the memorie of thy ſo infinite loue towards vs, and to receiue the grace which thereby is offered vnto vs, to the ioining of vs continuallie neerer vnto thee, till we be ioined without anie ſeparation vnto thee through thee.
                           Finallie, as in thine owne bleſſed perſon thou haſt giuen an example of perfect loue, whereby in humbleneſſe and meekeneſſe we ſhould ſerue one another, as thou being the Lord and maiſter of vs all, didſt vouchſafe, after thy laſt Supper, to waſh the feet of thy diſciples and ſeruants; grant vs that louing and meeke ſpirit of thine, whereby we may be far from diſdaine, and deſpiſing of our brethren, and readie in all good things to be dutifull and ſeruiceable vnto them in thee and for thee, that as thou haſt left vs in commandement, we may loue one another as thou haſt loued vs, and thereby be knowne to be thy diſciples, eſpeciallie O Chriſt, that we may be faithfull in our loue toward thee, who for our ſakes waſt content to be vnfaithfullie and vnfriendlie betraied of him, that had liued familiarlie with thee, that thou mighteſt thereby aſſure vs of thine euerlaſting loue and mercie. To thee therfore,

with the Father and the holie Ghoſt, be all praiſe, honour and glorie now and for euer,
                           Amen.
                           I haue ſinned, I haue ſinned, haue mercie on me.

                           Leuiti. 23, 27, &c.
                           
                              
                                 THIS is the daie of reconciliation, to make an attonement for you before the Lord your God: therefore ſhall it be an holie conuocation vnto you. And you ſhall humble your ſelues this daie in faſting and praier, and offer ſacrifice made by fire vnto the Lord. And whatſoeuer ſoule it be that thus humbleth not himſelfe this daie, euen he ſhall be cut off and deſtroied from among his people. Let this be a lawe and ordinance in your generations, and in all your dwellings for euer, ſaith the Lord.
                           
                        
                        
                           The Preface.
                           
                              CHriſt now once in the end of the world, through the eternall ſpirit, offered himſelfe a Lamb without ſpot to God; ſuffered for ſinnes, the iuſt for the vniuſt; died for all, and was killed vpon the altar of the croſſe, as perteining to the fleſh, but was quickned in the ſpirit, to put awaie ſinne by the ſacrifice of himſelfe. Wo and alas that euer I ſinned!
                           Chriſt became ſinne, and a curſſe for vs, to redeeme vs ſinners from the curſſe of the lawe, and to reconcile vs vnto the bleſſing and fauour of God his father, that we ſhould be made the righteouſnes of God in him. Wo and alas that euer I ſinned!
                           Chriſt was obedient vnto the death, euen vnto the moſt vile and ſhamefull death of the croſſe, to deliuer vs from death, hell, and damnation, and to tranſlate and bring vs into the kingdome of God his father.

Wo and alas that euer I ſinned!
                           Chriſt being in the forme of God, tooke on him the forme of a ſeruant, and made himſelfe of no reputation: but for the ioie that was ſet before him, endured ſuch blaſphemie, railing, & euill ſpeaking againſt him of ſhameleſſe ſinners; and when he was reuiled, reuiled not againe; when he ſuffered, threatened not: but committing the vengeance to him that iudgeth righteouſlie, deſpiſed the ſhame, and endured the croſſe, and ſuffered for vs wretches: leauing vs an example that we ſhould likewiſe followe his ſteps; by whoſe ſtripes we are healed. Wo and alas that euer I ſinned!
                           Oh my ſoule, come therefore let vs laie awaie that that preſſeth downe, and the ſinne that hangeth ſo faſt on; and let vs run with patience vnto the battell that is ſet before vs, loking vp vnto Ieſus the captaine and finiſher of our faith, and onelie reioice in the croſſe of Chriſt.
                           And ſeeing we haue redemption by his bloud, euen the forgiueneſſe of our ſins paſt, preſent, and to come: and for as much as we knowe how we are redeemed from our old vaine conuerſation, not with corruptible things, as ſiluer and gold; but euen with the pretious bloud of Chriſt, who in his owne ſelfe bare our ſinnes in his bodie on the tree, that we being deliuered from ſinne, ſhould liue vnto righteouſneſſe; who ſuffered alſo for vs in the fleſh, that we hencefoorth ſhould liue, as much time as remained in the fleſh; not after the luſts of men, but after the will of God; and reioice onelie in the croſſe of Chriſt.
                           Let vs take heed we walke not with thoſe that are enimies to the croſſe of Chriſt, and crucifie him dailie afreſh by blaſphemie, and all maner of vngodlineſſe; whoſe bellie is their God; whoſe glorie is their ſhame, and whoſe end is eternall damnation, both of bodie and ſoule: but rather with thoſe that haue their conſciences

purged from dead works to ſerue the liuing God. Let vs now paſſe the reſt of the time of this our abode here in trembling and feare: and euer reioice in the croſſe of Chriſt. For it is ſufficient for vs, that wee haue ſpent the time that is paſt of this life, after the will of the Gentiles, walking in wantonneſſe, in luſts, in exceſſe of wines, in exceſſe of eating and drinking, and in exceſſe of riot and abhominable idolatrie.
                           Therefore I crie wo and alas, that euer I ſinned: out vpon me wretch that thus greeuouſlie haue offended. O God my God, I aſke thee mercie: haue mercie vpon me, O Lord; haue mercie vpon me: wo is mee that euer I tranſgreſſed.
                           Oh my ſoule, let vs now eſteeme to knowe nothing, ſaue Ieſus Chriſt, and him crucified. Yea, God forbid that we ſhould reioice in anie thing, but in the croſſe of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, whereby the world is crucified to vs, and we vnto the world, that being crucified with Chriſt, we may liue with God.
                           And hauing now libertie to enter into the holie place, in the bloud of Ieſus, by the new & liuing waie which he hath prepared for vs, through the vaile of his fleſh: let vs conſider one another, to prouoke vnto loue and good works, and drawe nigh with a true and penitent hart, in aſſurance of faith, ſprinkeled in our harts from an euill conſcience, to meditate dailie of his mercies: and to giue him thanks continuallie for the benefits of his paſſion, & our eternall redemption, and ſtill to reioice in the croſſe of Chriſt Ieſu our Lord, and ſaie:
                        
                        
                           The Praier.
                           
                              O Lord Ieſu Chriſt, Sonne of the liuing God, both with mouth and hartie affection wee glorifie thee, and praiſe thy name with immortall thanks; for that of thine infinite

good-will towards mankind, thou vouchſafeſt to become an interceſſor for vs vnto thine heauenlie Father, for bearing his horrible wrath conceiued againſt vs through our ſinnes, and for offering thy ſelfe to death to adorne vs with eternall glorie.
                           Thou waſt hanged on the croſſe, made a curſſe for vs, ouerwhelmed with ſorowes too heauie for fleſh and bloud to beare. Thou ſufferedſt the diſpleaſure, which is a conſuming fire of GOD. Thou ſhedſt thy bloud from thy whole bodie, at thy death thy members beeing pierced. Oh Chriſt, oh ſweet Ieſu, thou ſhedſt thy pretious bloud, I ſaie, ſixe ſeuerall times from ſundrie parts of thy bleſſed bodie, afore and in thine execution for vs miſerable ſinners: as namelie, firſt in thy Circumciſion, which was the beginning of our redemption: ſecondlie in thy praier in the garden, which was for the earneſt deſire of our redemption: thirdlie, in thy whippings: and fourthlie, in thy crowning with thornes, which was for the reward of our redemption, for by thy ſtripes were we healed: fiftlie, in thy crucifieng and nailing on the croſſe, when thy hands and feet were bored through to faſten thee thereon, which was the price of our redemption: ſixtlie and laſtlie, in the wounding and piercing of thy bleſſed ſide, yea of thy verie hart, thou hanging dead on the croſſe, which was the true ſacrament of our redemption, whereby we are cleanſed, purified and waſhed from all our ſinnes. Among theſe thy diuers torments both afore & in thy execution, thy ſpirits being reſolued through the ſenſe of the infinite anguiſhes which thou ſufferedſt and enduredſt, oh Chriſt, thou vtteredſt diuers words, partlie by reaſon of intollerable greefe, and partlie of thine vnſpeakable goodnes. Oh teach vs by thy wiſedome reuerentlie to liſten vnto them, and to put them carefullie in the bottome of our minds.
                           At thy death mankind was ſeuered into two parts.

Thou the head of the penſiue Church hangedſt vpon the croſſe redie to yeeld vp the Ghoſt. Under the croſſe ſtands thy louing mother Marie, a few godlie women, and Iohn, thy weake diſciples moorning, through the rage of the Iewes hide themſelues. Nichodemus, and Ioſeph of Aramathie, to the great greefe of their minds, are faine to hold their tongs, and to winke at the outragious crueltie of their nation againſt thee. The graceleſſe Iewes, the vngodlie ſouldiers of Pilate and Herode laie hold on thee, mocke thee, blindfold thee, buffet thee, pierce thee, & plaie for thy garments. The epicures and tyrants, the high Prieſts and their paraſits, haue thee in deriſion, & laugh in their ſleeues to ſee how thy death is conſpired, and they may walter in all ſuperſtition and wickedneſſe. All this while the multitude of Ethniks in all quarters of the world celebrate their filthie and vngodlie feaſts, in the great diſhonour of thy name.
                           Thou beholdeſt this diuerſitie of men, which ſeeſt all things both in heauen and earth, and beeing in deed humble and meeke in hart, thou powredſt out a moſt charitable praier on this wiſe: Father forgiue them, for they knowe not what they doo. Theſe be the words of thy prieſthood. Thou which art the chiefeſt Prieſt, bedewed with thine owne bloud, entring into the holieſt of holie places, toucheſt the breſt of the Father, and ſearcheſt enen his ſecret counſell. Thou praieſt not onlie for thy weake auditors to be ſtrengthned, but alſo for thy verie enimies, which put thee ſo ſhamefullie to death, if they will returne vnto repentance: yea and for all mankind thou praiedſt; and namelie, for all and euerie one which ſhould beleeue in thy name.
                           O moſt mercifull interceſſor, we include our ſelues in theſe thy generall praiers, recited before thine agonie, repeated on the croſſe, yea vttered from the beginning of the world, and ſtanding at the right hand of thy

Father making interceſſion for vs, ſounded continuallie in the eares of God. Worke ſo, that we be not found in the number of thoſe, into whome ſathan hath entred, which blaſpheame thee, deſpiſe thy benefits, and deſtroie themſelues vtterlie. Increaſe our faith and knowledge of thee, that the eternall Father through thy ſacrifice being pleaſed, may forgiue all our ſinnes, and receiue vs into that companie which is glorious in thine eies.
                           Under the croſſe ſtandeth thy noble but ſorowfull mother, hir ſiſter, and other good women, with thy diſciple Iohn, whome thou louedſt. O bleſſe vs, and of thy goodnes ioine vs to that companie. In thy mother there ſhineth a notable light and ſtrength of faith; ſhe beholdeth in thee hir Sonne thoſe ſights, than which none could be more greeuous in this world; ſhe ſawe the rage of thine enimies, and thine intollerable torments; yet ſhe beleeued, notwithſtanding the greeuouſnes of thy paine, the ſhedding of thy pretious bloud, the flight of thy diſciples, the crueltie of thine enimies, and the odiouſnes of thy death; ſhe beleeued, I ſaie (O the force of faith!) that thou waſt God by nature, and ſhouldeſt riſe againe and reigne euerlaſtinglie, ouercome death and the diuell, and ſubdue all thine enimies.
                           O Sonne of God, kindle within vs we praie thee the like ſparks of faith: giue vs grace with thine elect neuer to be aſhamed to ſtand vnder thy croſſe. And as thou, euen of an entire good will, mercifullie among thy ſeruants didſt ſpeake vnto, and comfort thy penſiue and moorning mother, ſo ſpeake vnto vs and thy troubled Church; in miſerie comfort hir with thy ſweet voice and preſence.
                           Thou commendedſt thy mother to thine Apoſtle. Make vs vnfeignedlie to loue the Church thy ſweet and true mother, and grant that euerie of vs may

cheriſh the ſame louinglie, and mainteine it to the vttermoſt of our powers. Eſpeciallie guide the Preachers, that they may loue the mother; nouriſh the vnitie of pure doctrine; auoid the ſeed of hereſies, and remooue all ſtumbling-blockes, all occaſions of hindering of faith and praier in yoong Chriſtians.
                           At thy ſides hang two theeues, puniſhed for their ſinnes, according to the lawe and their deſerts; whereof one deſperatelie powring out blaſphemous ſpeeches, the other godlie requiring thy fauour, he ended his daies. All mankind, Lord, doo likewiſe hang in miſeries for their ſinnes, whereof ſome are ſo captiued in their minds, that at the point of death they ſcoffe, blaſpheme, and deſperatelie, to their vtter condemnation finiſh their daies: but giue vs grace, we beſeech thee, that we may imitate the example of the gratious theefe, which before his paſſage out of this life, moued by infallible arguments of thine almightineſſe and mercie, required pardon of his offences, and obteined the ſame according to his requeſt. Giue grace that we may imitate his hartie repentance, his ſorowe for ſin, his notable faith, his zealous confeſſion, and other good works of his.
                           We beſeech thee mercifull Lord be mindfull of vs. O Lord be mindfull of vs. Thou ſitteſt in the kingdom of thy Father, we are in the miſeries of the world: but be thou mindfull of vs. Begin thy kingdome in vs heere in this world, and in euerie combate of our conſcience, eſpeciallie at the point of death pronounce to our hearts this comfortable abſolution, This daie ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe. Shew vnto vs thy paradiſe, that departing out of this life, we may find reſt for our ſoules. Open to our ſoules the gates of Paradiſe, place them in the ſeates of immortalitie, and ſtate of bliſſe, where thy Father, togither with the bleſſed companie of Angels and men, ſheweth himſelfe euen

as he is.
                           In the meane, while thy combate is not yet finiſhed, thou criedſt in moſt pittifull maner, My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me? Thy diuinitie was not then ſeparated from thy humanitie, which neuer loſt that which once it tooke, neither ſurceſſedſt, nor dooeſt thou ſurceſſe at anie time to be equall and one with thine eternall father; but then was the houre of thy humiliation, wherein after a woonderfull and vnſpeakable maner, thy diuinitie hid it ſelfe as it were, and would haue this obedience to be ſhowne, and thought not beſt to deſtroie the Iewes thine enimies and murtherers. Yea it hid it ſelfe, that the ſtreames of Gods diſpleaſure againſt the ſinnes of men ſhould ſo fall vpon thee O Chriſt, that they ſhould wreſtle with extreame torments, ſuch as for a certeine ſpace thou perceiuedſt no comfort, notwithſtanding thy diuinitie confirmed thine humane nature, which was to ſuffer all the paſſions. For thy diuinitie could not ſuffer anie paſſion at all, & therefore it confirmed the ſame, that there might be a ſufficient ſatiſfaction for the ſins of men. For they which haue endured moſt greeuous torments, could neuer abide theſe: for if God comfort vs, we may abide the puniſhment of men, and then it may be ſaid:
                           
                              Though bodies greefe did feele,
                              Yet had their ſoules great ioie,
                              And vertuous hope did ſtrengthen ſo,
                              That paines did naught annoie.
                           
                           But intollerable is it for a creature to ſuffer the puniſhment of God, and be ſaued thereby.
                           Wherefore, O Sonne of God, in diſpleaſure bee mindfull of thy mercie, be thou our protection, that the wrath of thine eternall father doo not deſtroie vs. Euen a little taſte of Gods diſpleſure burſteth in peeces all the bones of men like a lion. And therfore by and by after thou vtteredſt the like complaint, ſaieng, I thirſt,
                              
thy ſoule languiſhed through the greatneſſe of thy paines. Thy ſpirits were reſolued through thy woonderfull greefe of hart. Thy bowels dried awaie, and no moiſture abode in them, and therefore trulie didſt thou both inwardlie thirſt and deſire ſome vertue and comfort from thy Father, and outwardlie to haue thy bodie refreſhed.
                           O Ieſu Chriſt, which art the fountaine of eternall life, giuing the water which quencheth all thirſt, from whoſe bellie ſpringeth the well of life, ſuffer vs not to taſte ſuch a greeuous thirſt, as did that merciles rich glutton in hell, which neuer was quenched, but with the godlie to ſaie, My ſoule ſtucke vnto my iawes, I had no quietnes in my bones, Lord in thy iudgements correct me, not in thy furie, leaſt I come vnto nothing. If thou obſerueſt iniquities, O Lord; Lord, who ſhall be able to abide? Thus doo thy Saincts crie, I ſaie, in their troubles. Wherefore kindle not thy wrath altogither againſt vs. Ceaſe not to comfort our weake nature ſtriuing againſt thy iudgements, with the iuice of thy word, and comfortable waterings of thy ſpirit.
                           Unto thee did thine eternall Father manifeſt his preſence and comfort for our ſakes, when ſome while after being better quieted thou ſaiedſt, It is finiſhed. Thou gaueſt thanks to thine eternall father, for helping thee, whereby the ſacrifice of welfare to the elect for euermore was fulfilled. Oh moſt ſacred Prieſt, imprint within vs this celeſtiall concluſion, this notable finiſhing of thy ſacrifice, that vndoubtedlie we may thinke, that by this ſacrifice the remiſſion of ſinnes and life eternall is purchaſed for vs.
                           Afterward, being deliuered from all feares, thou criedſt with a great voice, Father into thy hands I commend my ſpirit. Grant that in our departure out of this world, we may vtter the ſame words. Make vs to feele the preſence of thy father comforting vs, being

pleaſed through thee, and may know that with our bodies our ſoules doo not periſh: let vs not ieſt as Epicures doo, ſaieng: O fugitiue, flattering, pale, curſt naked ſoule, whither goeſt thou? Thou haſt prepared for vs, O Sonne of God, a large and a pleaſant place: In thy Fathers houſe are manie reſting places. We feare no torments. Thou haſt deliuered vs from the paines of hell. There is no purgatorie. Thy Father embraceth our ſoules in his mercifull armes, laieth them in Abrahams boſome, repleniſheth them with quietneſſe, with light and ioie vnſpeakable, till our bodies alſo raiſed againe, appeare with them in his euerlaſting kingdome. In this faith giue vs grace to leaue this world, and to reſt with thee for euer and euer,
                           Amen, Amen.
                           I haue ſinned, I haue ſinned, my God my God haue mercie vpon me.
God forbid that I ſhould reioice but in the croſſe of Chriſt, whereby the world is crucified to me, and I vnto the world.
                        
                        
                           
                              Or thus: A fruitfull meditation vpon the paſsion of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, to be read often.
                           
                           
                              O Lord Ieſus Chriſt, the Sonne of the euerliuing and almightie God by whome all things were made, be ruled and gouerned; thou the liuelie image of the ſubſtance of the Father; the eternall wiſedome of God; the brightneſſe of his glorie; God of God; light of light; coequall, coeternall and conſubſtantiall with the Father: thou which of the loue thou haddeſt to mankind, when hee was fallen from the fellowſhip of God, into the ſocietie of ſathan, and all euill, didſt vouchſafe for our redemption to become a mediatour betweene God and

man, taking to thy God-head our nature as concerning the ſubſtance of it, and ſo becameſt man: alſo the heire of all, and moſt mercifull Meſſias, which by the power of thy God-head, and merits of thy man-hood, haſt made purgation of our ſins, euen by thine owne ſelfe, whileſt thou waſt heere on earth, being now ſet on the right hand of thy Father for vs, euen concerning our nature, in maieſtie, in glorie & power infinite. I pray and humblie beſeech thy mercie to grant me at this preſent, to reherſe ſome of thy paſſions and ſufferings for me the laſt night, that thou waſt heere before thy death, that thy good ſpirit might thereby be effectuall to worke in me faith, as well for the pardon of my ſinnes by them, as mortification of mine affections, comfort in my croſſes, and patience in all afflictions, Amen.
                           
                           IN the middeſt of thy laſt Supper with thy deere Apoſtles, theſe things could not but be before thee, namelie, that they all would leaue thee, the moſt earneſt would forſweare thee, & one of the twelue ſhould moſt traiterouſlie betraie thee, which were no ſmall croſſes vnto thee. Iudas was admoniſhed of thee to beware; but when he tooke no heed, but went out to finiſh his worke, contemning thine admonition and counſell, he could not but vexe thy moſt louing hart.
                           After ſupper, there was contention amongſt thy diſciples, who ſhould be greateſt after thee, yet dreaming carnallie of thee and thy kingdome, and hauing this affection of pride and ambition buſie amongſt them, notwithſtanding thy diligence in reproouing and teaching them.
                           After thine admonition to them of the croſſe that would come, thereby to make them more vigilant, ſo groſſe were they, that they thought they could with their two ſwords put awaie all perils, which was no little greefe vnto thee.
                           
                              
After thy comming to Gethſamane, heauineſſe oppreſſed thee, and therefore thou wouldeſt thy diſciples to praie. Thou didſt tell to Peter and his fellowes, that thy hart was heauie to death. Thou didſt will them to praie, being carefull for them alſo, leaſt they ſhould fall into temptation. After this, thou wenteſt a ſtones caſt from them, and didſt praie thy ſelfe, falling flat and groueling vpon the earth: but alas, thou felteſt no comfort, and therefore thou cameſt to thy diſciples (which of all other were moſt ſweet and deere vnto thee) but lo, to thy further diſcomfort, they paſſe neither of thy perils, nor of their owne, and therefore ſleepe apace. After thou hadſt awaked them, thou goeſt againe to praie, but thou foundeſt no comfort at all; and therefore didſt returne againe for ſome comfort at thy deereſt freends hands, but yet againe (alas) they are faſt aſleepe, wherevpon thou art inforced to go againe to thy heauenlie Father for ſome ſparkle of comfort, in theſe thy wonderfull croſſes and agonies. Now, heere thou waſt ſo diſcouraged, and ſo comfortleſſe, that euen ſtreames of bloud came running from thine eies, and eares, and other parts of thy bodie. But who is able to expreſſe the infinitenes of thy croſſes, euen at thy being in the garden? All which thou ſufferedſt for my ſake, as well to ſatiſfie thy Fathers wrath for my ſinnes, as alſo to ſanctifie all my ſufferings, the more gladlie to be ſuſteined of me.
                           After thy bloudie praier thou cameſt, and yet againe foundeſt thy diſciples aſleepe; and before thou canſt well awake them, lo, Iudas commeth with a great band of weaponed men to apprehend thee as a theefe, and ſo doth, leading thee awaie bound to the high Biſhops houſe Annas, & ſo from him to Caiphas. Heere now to augment this thy miſerie, behold, thy diſciples flie from thee, falſe witneſſes be brought againſt thee. Thou art accuſed & condemned of blaſphemie. Peter

euen in thy ſight forſweareth thee. Thou art vniuſtlie ſtriken for anſwering lawfullie. Thou art blindfeeld, ſtriken and buffeted all the whole night in the Biſhop Caiphas houſe of their cruell ſeruants.
                           In the morning betimes thou art condemned againe of the Prieſts of blaſphemie, and therefore they bring thee before the ſecular power to Pilate, by whome thou art openlie arraigned as other theeues and malefactors were. And when he ſawe that thou waſt accuſed of malice, and that his wife had ſent a meſſenger vnto him, ſaieng: Haue thou nothing to doo with that iuſt man, for I haue ſuffered manie things this daie in a dreame by reaſon of him: yet he did not diſmiſſe thee, but did ſend thee to Herod, where thou waſt derided ſhamefullie, in comming and going to him and from him all the waie wonderfullie, eſpeciallie after Herod had apparelled thee as a foole.
                           Afore Pilate againe therefore thou waſt brought and accuſed falſlie, no man did take thy part, or ſpeake a good word for thee.
                           Pilate cauſed thee to be whipped and ſcourged, and to be handled moſt pitifullie, to ſee if anie pitie might appeare with the Prelates, but no man at all pitied thee. Barrabas that notable theefe and murtherer was preferred before thee: all the people head and taile was againſt thee, and cried out Crucifige, hang thee vp. Uniuſtlie to death waſt thou iudged. Thou waſt crowned with ſharpe thornes that pierced thy braines. Thou waſt made a mocking ſtocke. Thou waſt reuiled, beaten, ſcourged, ſpit vpon, and moſt miſerablie handled.
                           Thou wenteſt through Ieruſalem to the place of execution, euen to the mount of Caluerie: a great croſſe to hang thee vp was laid vpon thy backe, to beare and drawe as long as thou waſt able.
                           Thy bodie was racked to be nailed to the tree. Thy

hands were bored through, and thy feet alſo. Nailes were put through them to faſten thee thereon. Thou waſt hanged betweene heauen and earth as one ſpued out of heauen, and vomited out of the earth, vnworthie of anie place. The high Prieſts laughed thee to ſcorne. The Elders blaſphemed thee, and ſaid, God had no care for thee. The common people alſo laughed and cried, Out vpon thee. Thirſt oppreſſed thee, but vineger onlie and gall was giuen thee to drinke. Heauen ſhined not on thee; the Sunne gaue thee no light; the earth was afraid to beare thee; ſathan euen then tempted thee, and thine owne humane ſenſes cauſed thee to crie out, My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?
                           
                           Oh wonderfull paſſions, which thou ſweet Ieſus ſufferedſt for me and all mankind. In them thou teacheſt me; in them thou comforteſt me; for by them God is my father; my ſinnes are forgiuen me. By them I ſhould learne to feare God, to loue God, to hope in God, to hate ſinne, to be patient, to call vpon God, and neuer to leaue him for anie temptations, but with thee to crie, Father, into thy hands I commend my ſpirit,
                           
                           Amen.
                        
                        
                           The praier wherein we confeſſe our ſelues to be the verie cauſe of all theſe Christ his paſsions.
                           
                           
                              WHat haſt thou committed oh Lord, that thou ſhouldeſt bee ſo iudged? what haſt thou offended that thou ſhouldeſt be ſo cruellie handled and ordered? what was thy fault? what was thine offence? what was the cauſe of thy death? what was the occaſion of thy condemnation? I, Lord, I am the cauſe of thy ſorowe, the fault is in me that thou waſt killed; for I haue deſerued thy death. I committed the offences that were aduenged vpon

thee. Oh maruellous kind of iudgement, and vnſpeakable diſpoſition, or ordering of myſteries! The vniuſt man offendeth, and the righteous is puniſhed. The guiltie doth euill, and the innocent is beaten. The euill doth treſpaſſe, and the good is condemned. That which the euill man deſerueth, the ſame doth the good and iuſt ſuffer. That which the ſeruant doth amiſſe, the maiſter maketh amends. That which man treſpaſſeth, God ſuffereth it.
                           Oh thou which art the Sonne of God, how lowe did thine humilitie deſcend? How greatlie did thy charitie euen as it were waxe hot, and burne towards vs? How far did thy pitie exceed? Whither did thy benignitie and gentlenes growe and extend? How far did thy loue ſtretch? How far came thy compaſſion? For I did wrongfullie, and thou waſt puniſhed. I committed the miſcheeuous deeds, and they were aduenged vpon thee. I did the fault, and thou ſubmittedſt thy ſelfe to the torments. I was proud, and thou waſt humble and meeke. I was ſwelled and puffed vp, thou waſt extenuate and appaired. I was diſobedient, neuertheleſſe thou being obedient, bareſt the paines and puniſhments of diſobedience. I obeied, and was as it were a ſeruant to all exceſſe and gluttonie, and thou waſt puniſhed with ſcarſitie, and lacke of food. The tree did drawe me in my grandmother Eue, vnto vnlawfull concupiſcence and deſires, but perfect charitie led thee vnto puniſhment, and to endure the torments vpon the croſſe. I preſumed being forbidden, but thou didſt ſmart therefore. I tooke my pleaſure with delicateneſſe, thou waſt vexed with the croſſe. I abound, and haue plentie of all pleaſures, thou art all to torne with nailes. I doo taſte the pleaſant ſweetnes of the apple, and thou the bitternes of gall.
                           Behold O king of glorie, mine iniquitie and vngodlineſſe, and thy pitie and goodnes is manifeſt. Behold

mine vnrighteouſnes, and thy iuſtice is plainelie declared. What thing O my God, and my King, ſhall I render vnto thee for all theſe things, which thou haſt beſtowed vpon me? For nothing can be found in the hart of man, that may worthilie recompenſe ſuch rewards. Can mans wit excogitate or imagine anie thing that is woorthie to be compared vnto thy diuine mercie? Neither is it the office of a creature to go about to recompenſe fullie and iuſtlie the aid & helpe of a Creator.
                           There is trulie O Sonne of God, in this thy maruellous diſpenſation and appointments, ſome what, in which my fraileneſſe may helpe a little; if ſo be that my mind once pricked and ſtirred by thy viſitation, doo puniſh the fleſh, with the vices alſo and euill concupiſcences thereof. And this thing if thou wilt grant and giue me grace to doo, then ſhall it begin as it were to ſuffer and ſuſteine ſorrowes and greefes, becauſe that thou alſo didſt vouchſafe to die for my ſinnes, and ſo by the victorie of the inward man, it ſhall be armed (thou beeing a captaine) for the externall and outward victorie; foraſmuch as the ſpirituall perſecution once ouercome, it ſhall not be afraid for thy ſake to be obedient vnto the materiall ſword and croſſe of this world; and ſo the ſlenderneſſe of my ſtate and condition, if it pleaſe thy goodnes, ſhall be able according to the little power thereof, to anſwer vnto the greatnes and excellencie of my Creator.
                           And this is ye heauenlie medicine O good Ieſu; this is as it were a preſeruatiue of thy loue; this I beſeech thee, by thine accuſtomed & ancient mercies, to powre into my wounds, the fowle and filthie matter of the venemous contagion and infection once caſt awaie, which may refreſh and reſtore me to my former puritie and cleaneneſſe; that when I haue taſted of the pleaſant ſweetnes, which is, to abide in thee, it may make me to deſpiſe, and vtterlie ſet naught by the entiſements

of this world, and to feare for thy ſake none aduerſities thereof, and that I remembring thine euerlaſting nobilitie & excellencie, may alwaies abhor and diſdaine the troubles of this tranſitorie world.
                           And as thou, O Lord, waſt crucified for me, ſo I beſeech thee crucifie me with thee, that I may riſe againe with thee to euerlaſting life. Thy fleſh was crucified for me, crucifie with thee, O Chriſt, the kingdome of the fleſh, which hath dominion in me, that I may put off the old Adam, and by newneſſe of life, may be tranſformed into thee the ſecond Adam, ſinne, infidelitie, and the whole tyrannie of ſathan being vanquiſhed and ouercome. Bring to paſſe, O Lord, that by thy croſſe and painefull ſuffering, thy yoke may be to me made light, and thy burthen eaſie, that willinglie and gladlie following thee, I may come whether thou art gone, that is, to thy father, moſt bleſſed and immortall, from whome nothing ſhall afterwards be able to ſeparate vs,
                           Amen.
                           
                              
                                 I haue ſinned, I haue ſinned, my God my God haue mercie vpon me.
                                 God forbid I ſhould reioice in anie thing, but in the croſſe of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, whereby the world is crucified vnto me, and I vnto the world.
                              
                              Galath. 6.
                           
                        
                        
                           Another praier to Chriſt crucified, wherein we deuoutlie call to mind what great things he hath done for vs, and what benefits we reape by the remembrance of his holie wounds.
                           
                              EXceeding greatlie haue I ſinned againſt thy Maieſtie, O Lord, and mine owne conſcience findeth mee guiltie of manie offences; and yet doo I not deſpaire, neither will I in anie thing at all be doubtfull, becauſe that whereas ſinne hath abounded, there hath thy grace O

God, ouer-abounded. He that deſpaireth of the forgiuenes of his ſinnes, denieth thee O God to be mercifull. Yea great wrong doth he to thee, O God, which diſtruſteth in thy mercie. For (as much as in him lieth) he denieth thee to be louing, true and mightie, which are the things wherein my whole hope conſiſteth, that is to weet, in the loue of thy adoption, in the truth of thy promiſe, and in the power of thy redeeming.
                           Now let my vnwiſe imagination murmur as much as it liſteth, and ſaie, Who art thou? how great is thy glorie? and by what deſerts hopeſt thou to obtaine it? and I will anſwer boldlie; I knowe whome I haue credited, and that thou of thine exceeding great loue, haſt adopted me to be thy child; that thou art ſouthfaſt of promiſe; that thou art mightie of perſeuerance, and that thou maiſt doo what thee liſteth. I can not bee feared with the multitude of my ſinnes, if I bethinke me of the death of thee my Lord, becauſe my ſinnes are not able to ouercome thee. Thy nailes and thy ſpeare crie vnto me, that I am throughlie reconciled to thee O Chriſt, if I loue thee. Longius hath opened me thy ſide deere Ieſu with his ſpeare, and I am gone into it, and there doo I reſt in ſafetie. He that is afraid, let him loue, for loue driueth feare out of the dores. There is no remedie ſo mightie and effectuall againſt the heate of leacherie, as is the death of thee my redeemer. Thou ſtretcheſt out thine armes vpon the croſſe, and thou holdeſt out thy hand in a readines to imbrace vs ſinners. Betweene the armes of thee my ſauiour mind I to liue and die; there ſhall I ſing ſafelie; there will I glorifie and exalt thee, O Lord; becauſe thou haſt taken me vp, and haſt not giuen mine enimies their pleaſure ouer me.
                           Thou, O our Sauiour, haſt bowed downe thy head at thy death, to receiue the kiſſes of thy beloued, and ſo often doo we kiſſe thee, O Lord, as we be throughlie

touched with the loue of thee, who for loue to mankind, being God, cameſt to man, cameſt into man, and becameſt man; who for loue, being an inuiſible God, becaineſt like thy ſeruants, and who for verie loue, waſt wounded for our ſinnes; and in thoſe wounds of thine O my Sauiour, is the ſafe and quiet reſt of vs weakelings and ſinners: there doo I dwell at eaſe, and by thy wounds haue I a waie in vnto the bowels of thy mercie. Whatſoeuer is wanting of my ſelfe, that doo I borowe out of the bowels of thee my Lord: for in them is aboundance of mercie, and there want no holes for it to flowe out at.
                           By the holes of thy bleſſed bodie are opened vnto me the ſecrets of thy hart, a great pledge of thy kindlie loue, euen the bowels of the mercie of thee our God, whereby the daie ſpring hath viſited vs from aloft. Thy wounds, O ſweet Ieſu Chriſt are full of mercie, full of pitie, full of ſweetneſſe, and full of loue. They bored thy hands and thy feet, and pierced thy ſide with a ſpeare. By theſe holes may I taſte how ſweet and mild thou art in deed, and how mercifull thou art to all that call vpon thee in truth, to all that ſeeke thee, and cheeflie to all that loue thee. Plentious redemption is giuen vnto vs in thy wounds O ſweet Sauiour Ieſu Chriſt. Great aboundance of ſweetnes, great plentie of grace, and great perfection of vertues is giuen vs in thy pretious wounds O ſweet Sauiour Ieſu Chriſt.
                           O moſt bountifull Ieſu, grant therefore I humblie beſeech thee, that whenſoeuer anie fowle thought aſſaulteth me, I may forthwith runne to thy wounds O Chriſt. When my fleſh preſſeth me downe, I may riſe vp again by remembring thy wounds O Lord. When the diuell laieth wait for me, I may flee to the bowels of thy mercie O Ieſu, ſo ſhall he quicklie depart from me. Or if at anie time the heate of lecherie prouoke my members, let it be quenched I praie thee, by calling

to mind thy wounds O Sonne of God. Finallie, in all mine aduerſities, let me find no remedie ſo effectuall as thy wounds O Chriſt. In them, I ſaie, let me ſleepe without care, and reſt without feare. Thou, O Chriſt, haſt died for vs, and now is there nothing ſo bitter to the death, which is not ſwallowed vp by thy death, O ſweet Ieſu. All my whole hope therfore is and ſhall be in thy death O Lord my God. Thy death is my deſart and my refuge, my welfare, life, and reſurrection; and thy mercifulneſſe O Lord is my merit. I am not poore of merit, ſo long as thou the Lord of all compaſſions faileſt not. As long as thou art manifold in mercie, ſo long am I alſo manifold of deſerts. The mightier thou art to ſaue, the more am I without care.
                           Wherefore O moſt excellent goodnes, withdrawe not thy mercie; O moſt mightie maker, deſpiſe not thy worke; O moſt prudent redeemer, ſuffer not to periſh the price of thy redemption: O moſt gentle, ghoſtlie, and heauenlie hoaſt and gheſt, purifie, ſaue, dreſſe, and keepe thy houſe and dwelling place, the which thou dedicatedſt and ſanctifiedſt to thee in the ſacrament of Baptiſme. O moſt bleſſed, moſt charitable and ſweet Ieſu; O moſt bounteous, excellent and glorious Ieſu; O moſt innocent, mercifull, meeke, louing and deere Ieſu, haue mercie vpon me, haue mercie vpon me, and forgiue me all my ſinnes. When ſhall I loue thee? When ſhall I be ſorie for my ſinnes? When ſhall I loath and forſake my ſinnes? When ſhall I deteſt and abhore my ſinfull life, and turne vnto thee by grace? When ſhall I remember thy benefits, thy meekenes, thy pouertie, and bitter paſſion, thy patience, thy obedience, thy loue, and thy charitie? When ſhall I ſanctifie, worſhip, magnifie, and loue hartilie thee in heauen, and thy Saints on earth, and celebrate thy feaſts accordinglie; that is to ſaie, thy incarnation, paſſion, reſurrection, aſcenſion, and ſuch other, with due reuerence,

& Chriſtian deuotion. If thou be the moſt dredfull maiſter, where is my dread Lord Ieſu? If thou be the moſt loued Father, where is my loue? If thou bee my Lord and my Redeemer, where is my ſeruice? If thou be mine hoaſt, and dwell in my ſoule by thy grace and mercie; where is my chaſtitie, puritie and cleanneſſe meet and according to ſuch an hoaſt? If thou be the life of Saints, the faireneſſe and beautie of Angels, where is my thanking? Now therfore good Lord Jeſu Chriſt, wound my hart with thy moſt holie wounds, moiſt my mind with thy moſt pretious bloud, that whither ſoeuer I turne me, I may behold aboue me thee crucified, and whatſoeuer I ſee, it may appeare to me ruddie with thy moſt pretious bloud, that thus be holding, I may fixe my ſight in nothing but onlie in thee, which liueſt and reigneſt one God world without end, So be it.
                           
                           I haue ſinned, I haue offended, my God my God haue merceie on me.
                        
                        
                           A praier, wherein through commemoration of Chriſtes paſsion, we deſire pardon of our ſinnes, and continuance in vertue and godlineſſe.
                           
                              
                                 BEhold O pitifull Father, thy moſt pitifull Sonne, which ſuffered for me being ſo wicked. Behold O moſt mercifull King, who ſuffered; and remember as thou art louing and kind, for whom he ſuffered. Is not this O my Lord that innocent, whō although he were thy Sonne thou didſt deliuer to redeeme and ranſome a ſeruant? Is not this the author and beginner of life, which being led as a ſheepe to be killed, and being made obedient to thee, euen vnto death, was not afraid to take vpon him the moſt cruell and ſharp kind of death▪ Call

to remembrance, O thou diſtributer of all health, that this is he, whome although thou didſt beget him by thy power, yet notwithſtanding thou wouldeſt haue to be made partaker of thine infirmitie and weakenes. Trulie this ſame is thy God head, which did take vpon him thy nature, which was hanged vpon the gibbet of torment or croſſe, which in the fleſh which he had taken vpon him, did ſuffer ſorrowfull puniſhment.
                           Turne the eies of thy Maieſtie O Lord my God, towards the worke of thine vnſpeakable pitie. Looke on thy deere Sonne, whoſe whole body is ſtretched foorth. Marke the harmeleſſe hands and pure, which doo drop and diſtill downe innocent bloud. And I beſeech thee be pacified, and pardon the wicked deeds which my hands haue committed. Conſider his bare and naked ſide, being thruſt through cruellie with a ſpeare, and renew and waſh me with the holie fountaine or well, which I beleeue did flowe from thence. Marke the vnſpotted feet, which haue not ſtood in the waie of ſinners, but alwaies haue walked in thy lawe, how they are pierced through with ſharpe nails; and make perfect my ſteps in thy paths, and make me of thy louing kindneſſe to hate all waies of iniquitie. Remoue from me the waies of iniquitie, and make me of thy mercie to chooſe the waie of truth. I beſeech thee, O King of holie men, by this holie one of all holie ones, and by this my redeemer, to make me runne the waie of thy commandements, that I may be vnited and knit vnto him in ſpirit, which did not diſdaine to be clad in my fleſh.
                           Doeſt thou not looke vpon and marke O pittifull Father, the head of thy moſt deerelie beloued Sonne, a yong man, how it leaned vpon his ſhoulders when it was paſt the moſt pretious death? Behold O my moſt gentle creator, the humanitie and gentlenes of thy beloued Sonne, and haue compaſſion vpon the feeblenes

of thy weake and feeble handie-worke. Behold O moſt glorious parent, the torne and rent members of thy moſt kind & louing child, and remember gentlie what ſubſtance I am of. Behold the paines of him that is God and man, and releaſe and looſe man, which is thy creature, out of miſerie & bondage of ſinne. Behold the puniſhment of him that did redeeme, and pardon the offences of them that be redeemed. This is he, O Lord, whome thou didſt ſtrike for the ſinnes of the people, although he be thy welbeloued, in whome was found no guile, and yet neuertheleſſe, was he reckoned amongſt them that were full of iniquitie. Looke downe therefore, O Lord, thou louer of labouring and laden harts, with the eies of thy pittie, ſee the altar of the croſſe, where thy ſonne, thine onlie beloued babe is ſlaughtered. Behold O father of heauen, this thy bleeding babe, whom for our ſakes thou hadſt made vnder the lawe a curſe therof, in giuing him to the death, euen the acurſed & ſhamefull death of the croſſe, that he might thereby redeeme vs wretches that were his enimies from the lawe, and from the curſe and condemnation of it. O looke vpon him, I ſaie, which is the ſauiour of the world, and who in his ſufferings, and in his life and death hath fulfilled all the propheſies; behold him, that was made a caſtawaie of the Iewes, and a ſcorne of the Gentiles, which endured treaſonable hate of his friends, and deadlie terrors in his troubled ſoule, that we might haue peace of conſcience, and be reconciled vnto thee. And let his ſhame and ignominie, I praie thee, be our honour and triumph; his wounds our medicine, his curſe our bliſſe, and his death our life: finallie, ſo lighten our minds, I beſeech thee, with thy holie ſpirit, that we may be able to conceiue and vnderſtand the height and depth, the length & breadth, and by all meanes the infinite meaſure of this ſo exceeding loue towards vs, that the ſight and knowledge of ſo

great loue, may ſo inflame vs with the loue of thee againe, that all our thoughts, and deeds may wholie be ſet vpon thee, ſhewing our thankfulneſſe vnto thee in all obedience vnto thy word, and glorieng in nothing but in thy Chriſt, and him crucified, that in the end we may inioie the full fruit of all his paſſions, and of this thine vnſpeakable loue towards vs in our euerlaſting ſaluation, through Ieſus Chriſt our onelie Lord and redeemer, to whom with thee O father, and the holie Ghoſt, be giuen all praiſe, honour, and glorie, for euer and euer,
                           Amen.
                        
                        
                           Another godlie meditation or praier, wherin we declare vnto God the Father, that the paſsion of his Sonne before rehearſed, was for our reconciliation and attonement with God.
                           
                           
                              BEhold, O almightie God, Father of my Lord Ieſus Chriſt, I beſeech thee of thy benignitie and gentleneſſe to haue mercie vpon me, becauſe of the moſt pretious thing that I could find, the ſame I haue offered deuoutlie vnto thee; the thing of moſt eſtimation that I could imagine, I haue preſented humblie vnto thee. I haue left nothing, but I haue declared it vnto thy Maieſtie. There is nothing remaining that I may adde more, becauſe I haue committed and betaken my whole hope vnto thee. I haue ſent vnto thee mine aduocate and ſpokes-man, euen thy welbeloued Sonne Ieſus. I haue ſent thy glorious child to be a mediator betwixt me and thee. I haue ſent, I ſaie, an interceſſor, by whome I truſt to get pardon and forgiuenes of my ſinnes. In a word, I haue ſent the word: which word, as I haue ſaid, was ſent for my miſdeeds.
                           
                              
And behold, I haue rehearſed vnto thee the paſſion of thy moſt holie Sonne Ieſus Chriſt, which paſſion, I beleeue was ſuffered for me; I beleeue that the God-head which was ſent of thee, did take vpon him mine humanitie and nature, in the which he thought not ſcorne to ſuffer buffets, bonds, ſpittings, mocks, yea, he tooke vpon him to ſuffer the croſſe, nailes and dart. I beleeue alſo that his manhood, being of this my nature, during his infancie, was troubled with creeping and ſcrallings, and was wrapt in cloathes after the manner of other children; was vexed in his youth with labours; made leane with waking and faſtings; wearied with iournieng; afterward whipped and all to torne and rent with diuers kinds of puniſhments, reckoned among the dead, and when it was endued with the glorie of reſurrection, he carried it into the ioies of heauen, and placed it vpon the right hand of thy Maieſtie.
                           This I ſaie, he is my manhood, waie, and meanes of pacifieng and appeaſing thee, & the waie and meanes of hauing mercie vpon mee. Mercifullie looke vpon mee, heare the wretch whom he did redeeme, and the bond-ſeruant whom he deliuered. Behold him a Creator, and doo not deſpiſe a creature. Receiue the ſhepheard, welcommed with a gentle and louing countenance, and mercifullie looke vpon the ſheepe which he hath brought home vpon his owne ſhoulders. This is that moſt faithfull ſhepheard, which by manie and diuers labours and trauels ouer ſteepe hils, and through head-long and deepe vallies, did ſearch for his owne ſheepe that was ſtraied awaie, which alſo when he had found it faint and almoſt dead through long wandring, gat himſelfe vnder it with great reioicing, and making it faſt vnto him with a maruellous bond of charitie, lifted it vp out of the deapth of confuſion, and brought it home to the ninetie and nine.
                           
                              
Behold O King, my king and God almightie, behold a good ſhepheard, which rendereth to thee that which thou committedſt to his charge. He tooke vpon him through thine ordinance to ſaue man, whom he hath deliuered vnto thee cleane and pure from all ſpots, through the waſhing in his bloud. Lo thy moſt dearelie beloued Sonne hath reconciled vnto thee thy handie worke, which was gone aſtraie far out of the waie. Lo, a gentle ſhepheard bringeth home againe to thy flocke, hir that the violent pirate and robber had driuen awaie. He hath brought vnto thy ſight the ſeruant, whome hir owne conſcience had made to run awaie; that ſhe which by hir ſelfe had deſerued puniſhment, by thy Sonne being hir ſolicitor, hath deſerued forgiuenes, vnto whome alſo for hir offences, euerlaſting fire was due: neuertheleſſe, being a ſubiect vnder ſuch a prince and captaine, ſhe doth hope to be brought home to hir owne countrie.
                           I was able, O holie father, by my ſelfe to offend thee, but I was not able of my ſelfe to pacifie and appeaſe thee. Thy welbeloued Sonne, O my God, was made my helper, by taking vpon him mine humanitie, to the intent he might cure mine infirmitie, that wherof the firſt occaſion of thy wrath did ſpring, of the ſame he might offer vp to thee a ſacrifice of praiſe, and that he might render and make me alſo well-pleaſing to thy goodnes, by that thing, in the which he ſitting now at thy right hand, did alwaies ſhew and declare himſelfe to be equall with my ſubſtance, and as it were fellowe with the ſame.
                           Lo, my hope, behold in whome is all my truſt. If thou deſpiſe me (as it were meete) for mine iniquities, yet looke vpon me (at leaſtwiſe) mercifulle, for the charitie of thy welbeloued Sonne. Giue heed to thy Sonne, whereby thou maieſt haue mercie vpon thy bond-ſeruant. Looke vpon the ſacrament of fleſh, and

pardon the offences of fleſh. How often ſoeuer thou doeſt remember the wounds of thy bleſſed Son, ſo oft, I beſéech thee, let mine iniquitie be hid. And bicauſe fleſh hath ſtirred thee to wrath, let fleſh I beſeech thee mooue thee to mercie; that like as fleſh hath ſeduced and led me to ſinne, ſo fleſh may get and obteine for me remiſſion.
                           For certainly, it is much that mine iniquitie hath deſerued, but much more it is that the goodnes of my Redeemer may euen of right require. Mine vnrighteouſnes is great, but his righteouſnes is bigger. For looke how much God is ſuperiour vnto man, euen ſo much is my malice & euill inferiour vnto his goodnes, both in qualitie and quantitie. For what haue I ſinned being a man, that the Sonne of God being made man hath not redeemed? What pride could be in me ſo exceeding high, but ſuch humilitie as was in him ſhould bring it downe? What power of death was there in me ſo great, but the puniſhment, which the Sonne of God ſuffered vpon the croſſe, might deface it, and vtterlie deſtroie it? Trulie my God, if the ſinnes of ſinfull men or women ſhould be weied in a iuſt and equall balance, with the loue and fauour that was in our redeemer towards vs, the Eaſt is not ſo far diſtant from the Weſt, nor the innermoſt part of the earth ſo much ſeparated from the vppermoſt part of the heauen, as they ſhould be vnlike, ſo much leſſe ſhould mine iniquitie be than is his goodneſſe.
                           Now, O moſt noble Creator of light, now pardon mine offences, for the vnmeaſurable trauels & paines that thy beloued Sonne did ſuſteine. Now I beſeech thee let his goodneſſe be ſet againſt my wickednes, his modeſtie and temperance againſt mine vngratious frowardnes, and his meekenes againſt my fierce crueltie. Let his humilitie recompenſe my pride, his patience mine impatience, his gentleneſſe mine vnkind

churliſhnes, his obedience my diſobedience, his quietneſſe mine vnquietnes, his pleaſant towardnes my bitter frowardnes, his ſweet facilitie and gentlenes mine angrie and fretting fumes; to conclude, let his charitie make amends for my heinous and deteſtable crueltie,
                           Amen.
                           I haue ſinned, I haue ſinned, my God my God haue mercie on me.
God forbid that I ſhould reioice in anie thing, but in the croſſe of Chriſt, whereby the world is crucified vnto me, and I vnto the world, So be it.
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        9. On Eaſter daie. Of Christ his reſurrection, and the Paſſouer of Chriſtians.
                           
                        
                        
                           The Preface.
                           
                              CHriſt is riſen againe from the dead, and now dieth no more. Halleluiah.
                           
                           Death from hencefoorth hath no more power of him. Halleluiah.
                           
                           Chriſt is riſen againe, the firſt fruits of them that ſleepe. Halleluiah.
                           
                           By Chriſt, all men that were dead in ſinne, are reſtored to life. Halleluiah.
                           
                           In thy reſurrection, O Chriſt, both heauen & earth doo reioice and ſaie. Halleluiah.
                           
                           Thanks be vnto God which giueth vs victorie thorough our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Halleluiah.
                           
                           Who hauing ſpoiled all principalities and powers, hath made a ſhew of them, openlie triumphing ouer them in his owne perſon. Halleluiah.
                           
                           Awake O my Chriſt; awake vp my glorie, and ſing Halleluiah.
                           
                           For Chriſt our paſſouer is offered vp, and as this daie reuiued, roſe again for our iuſtification. Halleluiah.
                           
                           
                              
Let vs reioice therfore, I ſaie, O my ſoule, and keepe it holidaie to the Lord. Halleluiah.
                           
                           Not with old leauen of maliciouſnes and wickednes, but with the vnleauened bread of pureneſſe and truth. Halleluiah.
                           
                           That when we awake vp after his likenes, we may be ſatiſfied with his preſence in righteouſnes and glorie. Halleluiah.
                           
                           And be bleſſed and holie with thoſe that haue part in the firſt reſurrection, and on whom the ſecond death hath no power, but ſing Halleluiah.
                           
                           O death where is thy ſting? O hell where is thy victorie? Halleluiah.
                           
                           This is the daie which the Lord hath made, we will reioice and be glad therein, and euermore ſing Halleluiah, Halleluiah.
                           
                        
                        
                           The Praier.
                           
                              OF thy woonderfull victorie and reſurrection from death, and glorious kingdome O Sonne of God, it was ſaid, In that daie the roote of Ieſſe ſhall ſtand to be a ſigne to the people; vnto him ſhall the nations flie, and his reſt ſhall be glorie. Thou art that bleſſed branch of Dauid; thou tookeſt mans nature vpon thee, and cameſt of the line of Dauid: but in the time of thy humiliation thou waſt but a ſprig as it were in a drie ground: a notable and heauenlie plant, but oppreſſed with miſeries. Thy ſoule dried awaie, being beaten with the mightie tempeſt of Gods diſpleaſure againſt our ſinnes: notwithſtanding, that goodlie roote through the power of thy diuine nature was not vtterlie choaked. Thou art deliuered from the midſt of death, and by thy diuine power thou ſtandeſt victoriouſlie ouer thine enimies, and

art readie to bring vs thy ſouldiers from all euils, and make vs partakers of thy moſt glorious conqueſt in thy kingdome, which is altogither otherwiſe than the triumph and glorie of this world. Death endeth all the pride, power and pompe of this world, but thy death and reſt is glorious; thy kingdome and glorie beginneth when our life is ended.
                           O Chriſt Sonne of God, how woonderfull was thy reſt? Man at the firſt was made to be a noble and holie Temple, wherein a perpetuall Sabboth ſhould be celebrated, and a diuine nature ſhould abide, filling and comforting him with plentie of heauenlie riches. But this reſt was turned into vnquietnes, and this ioie into ſorowe, through the hatred of ſathan thine enimie which prophaned this temple and ſabboth, & brought in an horrible miſorder and wickednes. Wherefore it pleaſed thine almightie Father of his goodnes to ſend thee his onlie Sonne, from his owne boſome, to reſtore againe this Sabboth. Hence it was, that after a woonderfull manner, in the daie of the great Sabboth according to the lawe of Moſes, thine humane nature (through death which ſeparated the ſoule from the bodie) reſted in the ſepulchre, and the word (which forſooke not that nature, no not at the graue) reuiued that fleſh the third daie, and ſo thou roſeſt againe, when the time of our redemption was expired, victoriouſlie vnto thy kingdome, and giueſt an eternall Sabboth and reſt to ſuch as flie vnto thee.
                           O Sonne of God, call thou ſinners, euen vs miſerable and vncleane perſons, vnto that ſacred feaſt, which in this world through thee the cheefe Prieſt is begun, and ſhall be then made perfect, when the elect for euermore ſhall followe the Lambe whitherſoeuer he go. Put on vs the feſtiuall garment, the garment of thy righteouſnes and benediction, that we putting awaie the leauen of malice and wickednes, may celebrate

the feaſt in the ſweet bread of ſinceritie, & ſerue thee in purenes of liuing and truth.
                           This yeare from thine incarnation 1582. are paſſed 3091 yeares, ſince the firſt paſſouer which the Iſraelites did celebrate going out of Egypt; ſo long haſt thou preſerued thy Church, and we beſeech thee preſerue it euerlaſtinglie, notwithſtanding the rage of the diuell and his miniſters. And as thou defendedſt thy people which eate of the Lambe; and moreouer, going through out Egypt, ſlaiedſt in thy righteous iudgements all the firſt borne in the land; ſo aſſiſt vs, that with a liuelie faith we may feed on thee the true Lamb. Keepe vs among all the miſeries of this laſt age of the world. The carcaſes remaining, were caſt awaie and condemned; but thy oblation is gratefull in the ſight of God, it appeaſeth the wrath of the eternall Father, and by the eating of thee, which art the Lamb of God taking awaie the ſinnes of the world, righteouſnes and life is giuen to beleeuers. The word raiſeth againe and quickneth the fleſh, that vnto vs ingraffed therevnto by faith, the like life may be giuen, and the bodie of ſinne mortified in vs, and thou liue and reigne in vs for euermore, wherefore let thy glorious reſt be in vs.
                           We are made of earth, and after ſinne, our bodies were appointed to the earth; yea the vngodlie ſhall abide for euer in the earth, and neuer appeare in thy glorious heauen. But after thou touchedſt the death with thy liuelie fleſh, thou madeſt it light, thou tookeſt awaie the heauineſſe thereof. Through the blaſt of the firſt ſerpent manie times, euen mans fleſh is turned into verie ſerpents. And in the graue of the wicked, more horrible is the filth of ſpirituall dragons and ſerpents which deuour them euerlaſtinglie, and keepe them in perpetuall death. But thou, O Sonne of God makeſt the graues of thy ſaincts euen pleaſant chambers as it were. Thou driueſt far awaie from thence

all filthineſſe of ſathan. Thou ſetteſt about them the watchmen, euen thy pure Angels, which bring their ſoules into paradiſe, commending them into the hands and boſome of thy Father, and keepe alſo their aſhes, which both were and ſhall be at thy returne the houſe of the holie ghoſt.
                           Beautifie vs in like manner with this thy glorie of true knowledge and calling vpon thee. Be preſent with vs at the point of death; receiue our ſoules at their departure into thine hands, ſhew thou thy comfort & ioie, till at the reſurrection of mankind thou crowne thine elect with perfect & endleſſe glorie, a taſte wherof might be ſeene in thoſe fortie daies after thy reſurrection. Neuer was there ſo goodlie a world as that was, when thou roſeſt from death, and broughteſt out of their graues a great companie of thy Saincts, as the Scripture plainelie (but breeflie for the vngodlie) doth teſtifie. Familiarlie did the holie fathers and matrones remaine with thy ſweet mother and Apoſtles. Pleaſant ſpeeches and much talke was made, no doubt of the miſeries of man, of the vnſpeakable benefits gotten by thee, and of the glorie of eternall life.
                           O Lord, raiſe thou vp our harts, that with a true deſire, we may long to come into this faire companie. Let vs turne our ſelues in cogitation vnto that holie aſſemblie. Let vs hearken vnto and learne thy wiſedome reuealed in thy word. In this life thy Church is in darkeneſſe, in miſeries; men are occupied in the obſeruation of outward ceremonies, as thoſe godlie women; they will annoint thy bodie. Manie times thy Church ſeemeth to be depriued of thy ſweet preſence, and vttereth theſe ſorrowfull words: They haue taken awaie my Lord, and I can not tell where they haue laid him. But O Sonne of God, amend the mortall darkeneſſe within vs; kindle in our ſoule thine inward ſeruice which pleaſeth thee; manifeſt thy ſelfe

vnto vs in affliction; ſpeake theſe comfortable words in our calamitie vnto vs, Weepe not; that euen in death we may thinke with our ſelues that thou art preſent, and after death riſe againe to the fruition of eternall life, with thy bleſſed Saincts,
                           Amen.
                        
                        
                           Another.
                           
                              ALmightie God, and moſt mercifull heauenlie Father, who haſt raiſed vp thy Sonne for our iuſtification, as thou gaueſt him to death for our ſinnes, grant that thy holie ſpirit may worke that faith in vs, whereby we may be made partakers of that righteouſnes, which hee hath for thoſe that truſt in him. And becauſe without the bleſſed hope of riſing againe from the dead, our faith is in vaine, and we are yet in our ſinnes, therefore we beſeech thee to confirme and ſtrengthen it in vs, that as thou haſt alreadie raiſed vp Chriſt our head, ſo we may be aſſured thou wilt alſo raiſe vs vp, that the bodie may be ioined to the head. And furthermore, as thou haſt left this holie ſtorie of thy Sonne, that we might beleeue in him, and by faith obtaine euerlaſting life; ſo we beſeech thee worke the fruit of it in vs, in conſtant faith, to the ſaluation of our ſoules, and thy euerlaſting glorie, to whome with the Sonne and the holie Ghoſt, be all honor, praiſe and glorie, now and for euer,
                           Amen.
                        
                        
                           Another.
                           
                              ALmightie God, and moſt mercifull heauenlie Father, who according to all that had beene written before in ye lawe of Moſes, and in the Prophets, that it behooued the Sauiour of the world to ſuffer death, and to riſe againe from the dead the third daie, and

that repentance and forgiuenes of ſinnes ſhould bee preached amongſt all nations in his name, and ſo from point to point haſt fullie accompliſhed all theſe things in Chriſt Ieſus thine onlie Sonne, whome thou didſt raiſe from the graue, as this daie, not onlie to liue againe in this world, but euen to ſit at thy right hand, and prouiding for our infirmitie, haſt giuen vs a great manie of witneſſes, both of holie men and women vpon the earth, and of Angels from heauen, to confirme the truth of this matter vnto vs, that we might haue ſtrong aſſurance of ſaluation in him through faith. Open our minds to vnderſtand the holie Scriptures, and grant vs ſtedfaſtlie to beleeue this thy Goſpell, that by this faith, being made one with him, we may receiue the forgiuenes of our ſinnes, and the eſtimation of righteous men in thy ſight, through him. And furthermore alſo grant, that by this his mightie conqueſt, whereby he hath triumphed ouer the laſt enimie which is Death, in raiſing himſelfe againe vnto life, we may both riſe with him from the death of ſinnes, to the life of grace, by leading a new conuerſation, and ſit with him at thy right hand in hope, hauing our life hid in him, that when he ſhall appeare to come to iudgment, our life alſo heere being led in the obedience of faith, may then be made manifeſt, and we receiue that which we now in faith poſſeſſe, and in a bleſſed hope looke and wait for at his comming, which is the ſaluation of our ſoules, to the glorie of thy name, to whome, with the Sonne, and the holie Ghoſt, be all praiſe and honour now and for euer,
                           Amen.
                        
                        
                           A Thanks-giuing.
                           
                              WE lift vp our harts vnto thee, O Lord; for it is verie meet, right, and our bounden dutie, that we ſhould at all times, and in all places giue thanks vnto thee O Lord, holie Father,

almightie euerlaſting God: but chieflie we are bound to praiſe thee for the glorious reſurrection of thy ſonne Ieſus Chriſt our Lord. For he is the verie paſchall Lambe which was offered for vs, and hath taken awaie the ſinnes of the world; who by his death hath deſtroied death, and by his riſing to life againe, hath reſtored to vs euerlaſting life. Therefore with Angels and Archangels, and with all the companie of heauen, we laud and magnifie thy glorious name, euermore praiſing thee, and ſaieng: Holie holie holie Lord God of hoaſts; heauen and earth are full of thy glorie; Glorie be to thee O Lord moſt high, So be it.

                           The Preface.
                           
                              GOD is gone vp with a merrie noiſe, and the Lord with the ſound of the trumpet, Glorie to God on high. Halleluiah.
                           
                           He humbled himſelfe vnto the death, wherefore God alſo hath highlie exalted him, and ſet him on his right hand in heauenlie places, far aboue all powers and dominion. Halleluiah.
                           
                           God is gone vp on high, and hathled captiuitie captiue, and receiued gifts for men. Halleluiah.
                           
                           He that deſcended firſt into the lowe parts of the earth, is euen the ſame alſo that aſcended vp, far aboue all heauens, to fulfill all things. Halleluiah.
                           
                           God is gone vp with a merrie noiſe; the Lord is aſcended in great triumph. Halleluiah.
                           
                           Lift vp your head O ye gates, and be ye lift vp ye euerlaſting dores, that the King of glorie may enter in. Halleluiah.
                           
                           Yea, be thou exalted Lord in thine owne ſtrength, ſo

will we praiſe thy power perpetuallie, and euermore ſing, Glorie to God on high, Halleluiah.
                           
                        
                        
                           The praier.
                           
                              THou, O Chriſt ſonne of God, fortie daies after thy reſurrection, continuedſt in the world to the vnſpeakable comfort of thy Church, which being expired, thou aſcendedſt gloriouſlie in the ſight of thy Saints into the heauens. We yeeld thee moſt hartie thanks for this thy benefit, beſeeching thee moſt humblie to number vs among the ſaints and ſouldiers which wait vpon thee triumphieng. The hand-writing dependeth on the teſtimonie of our giltie conſcience, to our condemnation; but by thy death, the ſentence of condemnation is aboliſhed, and thy bloud waſheth vs from all our ſins. The enimies of thine elect, euen the diuell and death, are lead bound, and the whole companie of the ſaints both in heauen and earth, is filled with ioie, & ſpeake of thy victorie and benefits. Thy Saints in heauen viſiblie doo behold thy glorious victorie. Thy Saints in earth are ſaued by faith, for the ornament and glorie of the kings daughter is glorious within.
                           In the ſight of manie godlie auditors of thine, and of thy holie mother the bleſſed virgin Marie, thou waſt carried viſiblie from the earth in the clouds into heauen. Thou gaueſt a taſte of eternall life to thine Apoſtles wondering at thy departure, and preachedſt to them of thy returne into iudgement. Thou haſt glorified thine humane nature with vnſpeakable glorie, and placed the ſame on the right hand of thy Father, vpon the throne of triumph and victorie, as hauing for our ſakes, vanquiſhed all our enimies. But thine humane nature is not onelie aboue, as be thy

Saints, but is exalted alſo to ſuch a light, as cannot be attained to by anie creature. Thou reigneſt viſible with the Father, repleniſhing the whole celeſtiall congregation with righteouſnes and diuine glorie. Gouerne thou alſo in this mortall life, outwardlie in thy miniſterie, and inwardlie in our minds. Thou haſt aſcended on high, and lead captiuitie captiue, to beſtowe thy benefits vpon man.
                           Before thy departure thou renewedſt the inſtitution of thy miniſterie, thou gaueſt thy diſciples a commandement to preach to all nations; for which thy goodneſſe, we giue thee moſt hartie thanks: for therby thou haſt called vs to the ſocietie of thy Saints. Aſſiſt vs with thy ſpirit, that we may beleeue the Goſpell, and keepe for euermore the couenant which in our baptiſme we haue made with thee. Thou adornedſt thine Apoſtles which were to carrie a new doctrine ouer the face of the whole earth, with ſingular teſtimonies of miracles, that the Church might aſſuredlie knowe they erred not. Continue among vs in like ſort thy miniſterie, togither with the puritie of thy word. Send among vs Euangeliſts, paſtors and teachers, which may ioine themſelues to the doctrine of the Apoſtles, and diligentlie ſpread the ſame abroad, and ſpeake thou which art the head of the miniſterie within to our harts, and raiſe vp godlie motions through thy ſpirit.
                           Thou art aſcended on high to bee the head of thy Church, filling all things; finiſh thy worke in vs; ingraffe vs to thy glorified bodie, and powre vpon vs from thy diuine nature a like ſpirit, which may intermingle it ſelfe with our ſoule, and begin while we here liue, in vs an eternall life, which may create in vs a new man, faſhioned accordinglie to thy ſimilitude and likeneſſe. And inſpire in vs ſuch a perfection and righteouſneſſe, as thou ſhalt thinke meete and conuenient

for our weake and fraile nature; and let holie motions agreeing to thine heauenlie will be planted in vs. Driue awaie the darkeneſſe of our minds, extinguiſh the wicked affections of our hart, and let the new man dailie proſper and increaſe in perfection. Defend thy Church by thy mightie right hand, againſt all the power both of man and diuels. Fill our flitting ſoules with a taſt of a new life, receiue them into thine hands, and grant that at the reſurrection and glorification of thy Church, we maie ioifullie behold thee, returning and triumphing gloriouſlie, and ſo be placed in that kingdome, which thou wilt deliuer to thy Father, for their euerlaſting happineſſe,
                           Amen.
                           Halleluiah. Glorie be to God on high.
                        
                        
                           Anotherverie deuout meditation and praier, wherein the mind is verie much mooued, and plentiouſlie ſtirred to contemplation of heauenlie things, if it be ſaid in quietneſſe.
                           
                              MOſt mightie King, my verie good, gentle, & louing Lord Ieſu Chriſt, which of thine ineſtimable charitie and vnſpeakable pitie, taking vpon thee to be the ſeed of Abraham, not of Angels, didſt vouchſafe not onlie willinglie to ſuffer for our ſinnes both bonds, croſſe, wounds, yea death and ſepulchre, and after three daies (death being ouercome) didſt riſe againe for our iuſtification, waſt ſeene of thy diſciples, reforming their harts, and eſtabliſhing them that were almoſt declining from thee: but alſo after thou hadſt glorified our mortall nature with the ſtole of holie reſurrection and immortalitie, the fortith daie after thou in the ſight of thy diſciples, didſt with the triumph of thy glorie, gloriouſlie aſcend

into heauen, and cariedſt it aboue the heauens, and aboue all the melodious companie of Angels, aboue Cherubin and Seraphin, placing it vpon the right hand of God thy Father, where the Angels doo praiſe that ſame humane nature of ours, and all the powers of heauen doo euen tremble to ſee a man to be God ouer them, and where thou O Lord ſitteſt and liueſt euerlaſtinglie now, and reigneſt throughout all worlds.
                           Behold, I thy ſeelie creature, which with the weight of my frailenes am drawne euer downeward, and ſo not able to liue holilie, vertuouſlie, and as I ought to liue, without thy continuall helpe, whervnto I thinke it neceſſarie for me to ſticke and cleaue, moſt humblie beſeech thee to drawe me vpward toward thee, that I may runne after thee in the ſweet ſauour of thine ointments. Let me runne, and not faint, when thou draweſt me and leadeſt me running. Drawe the mouth of the ſoule that thirſteth after thee, vnto the high flouds and ſtreames of thine eternall aboundance and ſatietie: yea drawe me wholie vnto thy ſelfe, which art the liuing well, to the intent I may, according to my capacitie, drinke of that whervpon I doo liue.
                           O my God, my life, thou didſt ſaie with thy holie and bleſſed mouth; If anie man thirſt, let him come vnto me, and drinke. O well of life, grant vnto my thirſtie ſoule, alwaie to drinke of thee, that according to thy holie and true promiſe, waters of life may flowe out of my bellie. O well of life, repleniſh and fill my mind full of the riuer of thy pleaſure. Make my hart to be droonken as it were in thy loue, that after the manner of them that be droonken with wine, which forget all things ſaue the cup, ſo I may forget all vaine & earthlie things, and continuallie haue nothing elſe in my remembrance, but thee onelie, according as it is written; I remembred God and was delighted. Giue me the holie Ghoſt, whom thoſe waters did ſignifie, which

thou didſt promiſe to giue to them that thirſted after thee.
                           Grant I beſeech thee, that I may aſſaie to go with my whole deſire and all my ſtudie toward that place, vnto the which I beleeue thou didſt aſcend the fortith daie after thy reſurrection, that in this preſent miſerie I may be onlie in bodie, but in thought and deſire alwaies with thee, that my hart may be there whereas thou art which art my treaſure, worthie to be coueted, and much to be loued, wherewith no treaſure is woorthie to be compared.
                           Bring to paſſe, O Lord Chriſt, that through thy gift I may be ſtirred and carried vpward: for I feruentlie deſire to aſcend, yea I make certaine aſcenſions in my hart, lifting it vpward, and ſing the ſong of ſtarres. With the lampe of thy loue, I ſaie, am I kindled and moued to go with thee thither, whereas thou my portion reigneſt, and I beleeue to reigne; thither, whereas thou my fleſh art glorified, and I beleeue to be glorified; thither, where thou my bloud ruleſt, and I perceiue me to beare rule, that is, euen vnto the peace of Ieruſalem, to Ieruſalem I ſaie which is my countrie; to Ieruſalem which is my mother, would I now go vpward. For when I remember Ieruſalem, I extend and ſtretch foorth towards it the ſenſes of my hart, and towards thee, O Chriſt, which art a King ouer hir; hir light, hir father, hir defender, hir patrone, hir gouernour, hir keeper, hir chaſt and ſtrong delight, hir onlie and whole pleaſure, and of whome all hir goodnes and felicitie commeth, becauſe thou art the cheefe good, and the true good: and I will neuer turne backe, vntill thou bring me home from this pilgrimage, in which I am deformedlie ſcattered abroad, vnto the place of my deerelie beloued mother, whereas be the firſt fruits of my ſpirit; and vntill thou, O God, which art my mercie, faſhion me, and confirme me for euer.

Whither go we now vpward? to the peace of Ieruſalem? Bicauſe I was glad & reioiced in thoſe things which were ſpoken vnto me, therfore wil I go into the houſe of the Lord, there hath he placed vs, there wil he giue vs all good things, therfore will I will & deſire nothing elſe, but to tarie & remaine there before the Lord for euer. But, oh Lord, foraſmuch as whileſt we be clad in this bodie, we doo as it were go aſtraie, & are ſtrangers vnto thee; we haue not here an abiding place for euer; but we ſeeke for one that is to come: our abiding place is in heauen, whither thou art aſcended. Therefore thy fauour and grace my guide, I enter into the chamber of my hart, and ſing vnto thee ſongs of loue, my King and my GOD, mourning with maruellous ſighings in this place of my peregrination, whereas thy iuſtices are my ſongs, and whereas I am toſſed with ſtormes on euerie ſide. For in this great floud of this life, there is no ſtedfaſt ſtanding, or place high inough aboue the waters; no not for the foot of a doue to reſt vpon. In this life, I ſaie, there is no ſafe or quiet peace; no where anie ſure reſt; euerie-where battell and ſtrife; euerie-where enimies and fightings without doores, and frights and feares within doores.
                           And for aſmuch as the one part of vs is heauenlie, and the other earthlie; our bodie which is corrupt, doth loden, and is burdenous vnto the ſoule: therefore my mind, which is my felowe and freend, being wearie with wandering foorth of the waie, is ſicke, and lieth all to torne and rent of thoſe things, which it hath paſſed by. It hungreth and thirſteth greatlie after vanities, and I haue nothing to ſet afore it, bicauſe I am poore and a begger. Thou, O Lord my God art rich in all good things, and the moſt plentious giuer of the deinties of heauenlie ſatietie. Giue meate vnto the wearie; not ſuch as it thirſteth after, but ſuch as is conuenient for it. Gather togither the diſperſed; renew

and refreſh the torne. Lo, he ſtandeth at the doore and knocketh. I beſeech thee, by the bowels of thy mercie, wherwith thou being the daie-ſpring from an high haſt viſited vs; open the hand of thy pitie to a wretch that knocketh, and vouchſafe mercifullie to enter into thee; and that I may reſt with thee, and be refreſhed of thee, which art the liuing & heauenlie bread, wherewith when I am once fed, and that my ſtrength is come to mee againe: I may aſcend vnto more high things, and be lifted vp out of this vale of miſerie and teares, and with the wings of my godlie deſires I may flie vp vnto thee, and the heauenlie kingdome.
                           Let my ſpirit, O Lord, I beſeech thee, take wings as an Egle, and flie without fainting: let it flie vp, and come to the beautifulneſſe of thine holie houſe, and to the place of heauen, where thy glorie dwelleth; whereas vpon the meate-tables of thy ſupernall citizens, it may be fed full of thy ſecrets in the place of thy paſture by the moſt plentifull riuers ſides. Let mine hart reſt in thee, my God; my hart, I ſaie, which is as though it were a great ſea ſwelling with waters. Thou diddeſt rebuke the winds and the ſea, and there was made ſtreightwaies a great calme: O come and wake vpon the fluds of mine hart, that all things which belong vnto me, may be made calme and cleere: that I may imbrace thee, which art mine onelie God, and that I may behold thee, which art the ſweet light nf mine eies without anie blind darkneſſe of troubleſome cogitations and thought. Let my mind flie, O Lord, vnder the ſhadowe of thy wings for meate, that it being couered with the temperateneſſe of thy pleaſant coolneſſe, may ſing ioifullie, and ſaie; I will laie me downe, and reſt in peace. Finallie, let my memorie ſleepe, O my God, I beſeech thee, from all euils; make it to hate iniquitie, and to loue righteouſneſſe. For what can be better, or more delectable, than in the middes of the darkneſſe of

this life, and among the manifold and bitter miſeries of the ſame, to deſire feruentlie heauenlie ſweetneſſe? To couet euerlaſting bleſſedneſſe? Or our mind to be held euer there, whereas we may be moſt ſure to haue infallible and true ioies?
                           Oh Lord, which for thy louing kindneſſe art moſt woorthie to be deſired, and coueted of all things: when ſhall I ſee thee? When ſhall I appeere before thy face? When ſhall I be ſatiſfied of thy glorie? When wilt thou bring me foorth of this darke priſon, that I may confeſſe thy name, ſo that afterward I bee no more pricked? When ſhall I paſſe, and go to that maruellous and beautifull houſe of thine, whereas the voice of gladneſſe and reioicing doth ſound in the tabernacles of iuſt men? Bleſſed are they that dwell in thine houſe, O Lord; they ſhall praiſe thee euer world without end. Bleſſed are they, yea bleſſed indeed, whom thou haſt choſen, and taken into that heauenlie inheritance. Behold, O Lord, thy Saints flouriſh before thee, like vnto lillies. For they are repleniſhed with the plentiouſneſſe of thine houſe, and thou dooeſt giue them to drinke of the flowing riuer of thy pleaſure, bicauſe thou art the well of life, and in thy light and brightnes they doo ſee light; and that ſo greatlie, that they themſelues, which are a light, and are made bright by thee, O Lord, which dooſt giue them light, doo ſhine like vnto the ſunne in thy ſight.
                           O how maruellous, how faire and beautifull, how acceptable are the manſions and dwelling places of thine houſe! O Lord of powers, my ſinfull ſoule dooth couet to enter into them. O Lord, I haue loued the comlineſſe of thine houſe, and the place where thine honour dwelleth. I aſked one petition of the Lord, and the ſame will I require; that I may dwell in the houſe of the Lord all the daies of my life. Like as the Hart coueteth to go vnto the water brookes; euen ſo

dooth my ſoule deſire to come vnto thee, O Lord. When ſhall I come and appeare before the face of my Lord? When ſhall I ſee God, after whom my ſoule longeth verie ſore? When ſhall I ſee him in the land of the liuing? For in this land of the dead he cannot be ſeene with mortall eies.
                           What ſhall I doo wretch that I am, which am fettered with the heauie gieues of mortalitie? What ſhall I doo? Whiles we continue in this bodie wee go aſtraie from the Lord: we haue here no abiding place for euer; but we labour for one that is to come. Our free citie is in heauen. Wo is me; me thinke I dwell among the barbarous nations and infidels, and not amongſt the faithfull Iſraelites. I lead my life in the tents of Cedar. My ſoule hath dwelt too long with them that hate peace and quietneſſe. Who will giue me wings as a dooue, that I may flie awaie, and reſt me? There is nothing that I deſire, or delight ſo much in, as to be in my Lords companie. It is good for me to cleaue vnto God. Oh grant me, O Lord, whileſt I am in theſe fraile members, to ſticke vnto thee, as it is written; He that cleaueth vnto the Lord, is all one ſpirit with him. Giue me therefore, I beſeech thee, the wings of contemplation, wherewith when I am apparelled, I may flie vpward. And for aſmuch as euerie vnluckie and infortunate thing lieth beneath: doo thou, O Lord, hold vp my mind, leaſt it fall headlong into the loweſt bottoms of the darke vallie, and leaſt the ſhadowe of the earth ſhould come betweene and ſeparate it from thee, that art the bright ſunne of righteouſnes; and leaſt it once hid with the clouds of darkneſſe, ſhould not haue libertie; but be letted to looke for heauenlie things which be aboue.
                           Therefore I doo aſſaie to go vpward vnto the ioies of quietneſſe and peace, and vnto the delectable and pleaſant ſtate of light. O hold mine hart with thine

hand, bicauſe it cannot be drawne vnto high things without thee. Thither doo I make haſte, whereas moſt chiefe and principall peace reigneth, and continuall quietneſſe ſhineth foorth. Hold and gouerne my ſpirit, and take it according to thy will, that thou being a guide vnto it, it may aſcend into the region and countrie of plentifulneſſe, wheras thou feedeſt Iſrael euerlaſtinglie with the food of truth, to the intent, that there at the leaſtwiſe with my ſwift cogitation and thought, I may come nigh thy wiſedome, which remaineth aboue all things, ouerpaſſeth all things, and gouerneth all things.
                           But alas, there be manie things, which when my ſoule would flie vnto thee, doo crie out vpon it. Command them all, O Lord, to hold their peace, and ſpeake not vnto me. As for my ſoule it ſelfe, let it giue neuer a word to anſwer. Let it paſſe by all things. Let it clime aboue althings that be created, & come vnto thee. And that it may faſten the eies of faith vpon thee, which art the onlie Creator of all things. Let it couet vnto thee, and be bent towards thee. Let it thinke vpon thee by meditation and contemplation; let it laie thee before hir eies for it ſelfe. Let it roll and toſſe thee in hir hart; thee, I ſaie, which art the true and chiefe goodneſſe, and the ioie that will remaine without ending.
                           There are ſurelie manie contemplations, in the which mans ſoule is maruellouſlie fed of thee; but in none of them is my ſoule ſo much delighted, or yet hath ſo good reſt in, as in thee, and when as it thinketh vpon thee, and hath thee onelie in contemplation. Oh how much is thy ſweetneſſe, O Lord! How maruellouſlie dooeſt thou inſpire the harts of them that loue thee? How delectable is thy loue, the fruition whereof they haue that loue nothing but thee; they ſeeke nothing elſe; they couet nothing elſe: happie are they, whoſe onelie hope thou art; which haue no truſt, but in thee

onlie, and all their whole worke is praier. Bleſſed is he that ſitteth ſolitarie alone, and holdeth his peace, and ſtandeth vpon his ward, that he is ſet to keepe continuallie daie and night, that yet whileſt he is in this fraile bodie, he may be able to taſte ſomewhat thy pleaſures.
                           I require thee by thoſe thy wounds, which bring health vnto vs, which wounds thou ſufferedſt vpon the croſſe for our health; out of the which thy pretious bloud (wherewith thou redeemedſt vs, did diſtill and drop downe,) wound this my ſinful ſoule, for the which alſo thou didſt vouchſafe to die: wound it, I ſaie, with the fire and mightie dart of thy great charitie. For the word of God is liuelie and effectuous, and more pearcing and ſharpe than anie two edged ſword. Thou, O choſen dart, and moſt ſharpe ſword, which art able by thy power to pearce through the hard ſhield, or buckler of mans hart, faſten and ſtrike the ſhaft of thy loue in mine hart, that my ſoule may ſaie vnto thee; I am wounded with thy charitie, ſo that foorth of that ſame wound of thy loue, teares may flowe moſt plentiouſlie both daie and night.
                           Strike, O Lord, ſtrike I beſeech thee this moſt indurated and hardened hart and mind of mine, with the ſharpe dart of thy loue, and pearce it deeper & deeper into the innermoſt parts thereof, by thy mightie power, and ſo bring out of my head aboundance of water, and out of mine eies a verie well of teares, continuallie running, through the great affect, and maruellous deſire to ſee thy glorie, that I may moorne daie and night, without taking anie comfort in this life, vntill in thy heauenlie wedding chamber I may ſee thee my welbeloued and beautifull ſpouſe, my God and my Lord, and that there when I ſee thy glorious, maruellous, and beautifull face full of all ſweetnes, togither with them which thou haſt choſen, then I ſaie, I

may worſhip humblie thy Maieſtie, and there at the laſt being repleniſhed with heauenlie and vnſpeakable reioicing of euerlaſting gladneſſe, I may euer crie out with them that loue thee, ſaieng: Behold, that which I haue long deſired, now I haue obteined, for I am ioined in heauen vnto him, whome when I was in earth, I loued with all my ſtrength, with all my charitie. I embraced him, vnto whome with all my loue I did ſticke and cleaue. Him doo I praiſe, bleſſe, and woorſhip, that liueth and reigneth God world without end,
                           Amen.
                        
                        
                           Another praier to Chriſt, aſcended and reigning in glorie.
                           
                           
                              OH good Chriſt, our firſt begotten brother, and tender-harted Ioſeph! Oh naturall Sonne of that father, to whome we are made children of adoption through thee! Oh our head, reigning on high in glorie, forget not vs thy poore members heere on earth, where-into abaſing thy ſelfe, thou cammeſt downe, and ſufferedſt for vs moſt cruell death! Out of this thy throne of maieſtie and glorie thou putteſt vs in aſſured hope and confidence, that we alſo ſhall atteine to this bleſſed place, whither thou art gone before to take poſſeſſion for vs. Oh our ſtrong tower of defence and ſuccour, what can hurt vs now truſting in thee? Moſt vnhappie are they which are ignorant of thee, and moſt happie are they which alwaies behold thee. Bleſſed are they which haue knowne thee heere in the daies of this mortalitie: but more bleſſed are they which ſee thee in the heauens, and ſhall ſee thee reigning with thy Father in ioies incomparable.
                           Oh Lord, the onelie ioie and comfort of our ſoules,

ſhew vs thy louing countenance, embrace vs with the armes of thy mercie. Receiue vs, O good Ioſeph thy yonger brethren, with the kiſſe of comfort. Powre into our harts thy holie ſpirit. Plucke vs vp from the earth and earthlie things. Open our eies, and lift them vp vnto thee. Open thy mouth, and call vs vnto thee. Open our eares, that we may heare thee, ſo that whatſoeuer wee doo ſpeake or thinke, it may be directed vnto thee alone our redeemer, mediator and aduocate,
                           Amen.
                        
                        
                           Another.
                           
                              THou Lord didſt put awaie Marie Magdalen from thee kiſſing of thy feet, becauſe thy fleſh was not yet exalted, and ſhe knewe not yet the dignitie of thy clarified bodie, and beautified with the glorie of immortalitie, but was addicted onlie to thy bodilie preſence. She yet ſought thee liuing among the dead; neither was it knowne to hir that thou waſt equall with thy Father: wherefore thou wouldeſt not ſuffer hir ſo much as to kiſſe thy feet, becauſe it was a thing vnworthie for thy Maieſtie.
                           O thou mightie Lion of the tribe of Iuda; thou conqueror of hell and death, euerliuing and immortall; thou art now riſen from death for vs. Thou art now aſcended to thy Father and our Father, and ſitteſt at the right hand in glorie: grant that we alſo in hart and mind may thither aſcend, and with thee continuallie dwell. Suffer vs to come neere vnto thee, that we may kiſſe thee. Yea Lord, thou louer of our ſoules, come thou rather vnto vs, and kiſſe vs with the kiſſe of thy mouth, that we may be glad & reioice in thee. Drawe vs, that we may runne after the ſauour of thy ſweet ointments, that we may behold thee in righteouſnes,

and when thy glorie ſhall appeare, we may be ſatiſfied. For in thy preſence there is fulnes of ioie, and on thy right hand there are pleaſures for euermore, So be it, Halleluiah.
                           
                        
                        
                           A Thanks-giuing.
                           
                              WE lift vp our harts vnto thee, O Lord God: for it is verie meete, right, and our bounden dutie, that we ſhould at all times, and in all places, giue thanks vnto thee O Lord holie Father, almightie euerlaſting God, through thy moſt deere beloued Sonne Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, who after his glorious reſurrection, manifeſtlie appeared to all his Apoſtles, and in their ſight aſcended vp into heauen, to prepare a place for vs, that where he is, thither we might alſo aſcend to reigne with him in glorie. Therefore, with Angels, and Archangels, and with all the companie of heauen, we laud and magnifie thy glorious name, euermore praiſing thee, and ſaieng, Holie holie holie, Lord God of hoaſts, heauen and earth are full of thy glorie, Glorie be to thee O God moſt high, So be it.
                        
                     
                     
                        11. On Whitſundaie, or the feaſt of Pentecoſt. Of the ſending of the Comforter, euen the ſpirit of truth.
                           
                        
                        
                           The Preface.
                           
                              THE ſpirit of the Lord filleth the round compaſſe of the world, and vpholdeth all things. Halleluiah.
                           
                           The ſpirit of wiſedome is louing, and will not abſolue him that blaſphemeth with his lips. Halleluiah.
                           
                           The holie ſpirit of diſcipline flieth from deceipt, and

withdraweth himſelfe from thoughts that are without vnderſtanding. Halleluiah.
                           
                           This therefore is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loue darkeneſſe more than light. Halleluiah.
                           
                           But O Father, leaue vs not comfortleſſe, but come vnto vs, and giue vs the Comforter, euen the holie ſpirit of truth, which the world can not receiue, that he may abide with vs, and dwell within vs for euer. Halleluiah.
                           
                           Come holie Ghoſt, and teach vs in all thy waies, and bring all things to our remembrance whatſoeuer God hath commanded vnto vs, that we may ſpeake with new lips, and magnifie God, according to his will. Halleluiah.
                           
                           Make me a cleane hart O God, and renew a right ſpirit within me. Halleluiah.
                           
                           Caſt me not awaie from thy preſence, and take not thy holie ſpirit from me. Halleluiah.
                           
                           O giue me the comfort of thy help againe, and ſtabliſh me with thy free ſpirit. Halleluiah.
                           
                           Then ſhall I teach thy waies vnto the world, and ſinners ſhall be conuerted vnto thee. Halleluiah, Halleluiah.
                           
                        
                        
                           The Praier.
                           
                              IF ye loue me, keepe my commandements, and I will pray the Father, and he ſhall giue you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for euer, euen the ſpirit of truth, whom the world cannot receiue, &c. Oh heauenlie ſpeech to be had in perpetuall remembrance! Thou O Chriſt promiſeſt ſuch as keepe thy commandements, ſuch as in faith and a good conſcience obeie thee, to bee loued intirelie of thy Father, and their breſts to be the

inhabiting place of thy diuinitie. Nothing is more lamentable, than to be caſt from God into feare and fire vnquenchable; nothing more comfortable; than to haue thy fauour, and to be loued of God. This ſo excellent a benefit thou doeſt promiſe to thy diſciples, wherfore ingraffe vs to the bleſſed companie which thy Father doth loue, whoſe ſinnes are forgiuen through thy deſerts, and they are receiued into mercie, and the inheritance of eternall life through thy death. Neither is it thy will to haue vs preſent in loue, and by the imputation of thy righteouſnes onlie, but alſo by a naturall participation and reall conformitie with God in deed.
                           Man deceiued by the diuell, forſooke God his gouernour, & conceiued ſo highlie of himſelfe, that he would rule himſelfe without God. Let God defend thy life, the reſt ſeeke from thy ſelfe, ſaie the wiſe men of this world; and they commend that man whoſe onlie hope dependeth vpon himſelfe. But O lamentable darkeneſſe, how ſhamefullie doth man fall without God aſſiſt! How miſerablie doth he periſh, whome God forſaketh! Wherefore taking pitie on our wretched ſtate, thou reſtoreſt the ancient order, interrupted through ſinne, and wilt that the harts of the faithfull ſhall againe be made ye dwelling place, & temple of diuinitie.
                           The God-head in deed is euerie where, vpholding as long as hee thinketh good, the whole frame of the world, and the ſubſtance of euerie particular thing therein: and againe deſtroieng all when he thinketh good ſo to doo; notwithſtanding, he abideth onlie in the ſoule, which receiueth Chriſt: into it doo the Father and the word breath of their ſpirit, and link it to themſelues in like light, righteouſneſſe and life. In the Sonne the glorie of the Father doth ſhine, and filleth that humane ſubſtance, which the word, through an eternall couenant, coupleth to himſelfe with the ſame

ſpirit, and powreth it into the harts of beleeuers, to make them like vnto him. For the word, through the ſame ſpirit, quickeneth both his owne and our fleſh. And this is the beginning of eternall life in this miſerable world. This ſpirit imprinteth the image of God, which the word (preſent in our minds) doth ſpeake in our ſoule, kindeling a light and knowledge conformable to the Goſpell, turneth vs to the true ſeruice of GOD, and ſtirreth vp in our wils ſo holie motions, agreeing to the lawe of Chriſt, as ſhine in that humane nature of Chriſt now glorified, who cureth our infirmitie.
                           He commeth from the Father ſent by the Sonne to renew vs according to the image of Chriſt. He returneth to the Sonne and Father to couple vs vnto God; to make interceſſion for vs with grones vnſpeakable, and to mooue the hart of eternall God vnto mercie and compaſſion towards vs. Such is our nature, that through Gods ſpirit we reaſon chriſtianlie, and thinke godlie: then how can it be, but that the ſpirit muſt raiſe godlie cogitations & good motions in our minds, which is by nature a God, and therefore ſubſtantiallie doth he mingle himſelfe with our ſpirits, ſpringing in our nature, but regenerated by him to imprint in vs another light and newneſſe, than is naturall wiſdome and righteouſneſſe; and therefore manie ſighes doo we fetch, euen theſe deepe ſighes.
                           And thou word dwelling in our minds, be thou preſent, and kindle our harts by thy blaſt. Conuert vs, Lord, and we ſhall be conuerted. Turne vs to the acknowledging of our ſinnes; erect vs by the preaching of the Goſpell, and grant that through faith we may receiue the promiſe of the ſpirit. Strengthen vs, that we may retaine ſo excellent a gift, and at no time be intangled in the ſnares of Sathan, neither yet forgo ſo noble a gheſt, for our wickednes, Make vs to walke

circumſpectlie, not as fooles following our vaine concupiſcence; to ſhun all occaſions of falling, & euermore to craue at thine hands, that this pretious gift may from time to time continue with vs, and increaſe.
                           And as vpon this daie thou haſt taught the harts of thy people, by the ſending to them the light of thine holie ſpirit; ſo grant vs by the ſame ſpirit, to haue a right iudgment in all things, and euermore to reioice in his holie comfort. Let the ſame ſpirit bring into our memorie, that which thou haſt ſaid; make it firmelie to retaine the foundation of ſound doctrine, vttered from the boſome of the Father, and at no time to ſeeke new reuelations, as doo the Enthuſian heretikes, both without and beſide the warrant of thy word. Let vs neuer inuent fained gods, and falſe worſhippings; but followe onelie and ſincerelie that, which thou haſt ſaid and taught.
                           The world followeth vaine pleaſure, ſeeketh proſperitie, and hunteth after wealth and worſhip, eſpeciallie the laſt age of this world doth ſo: it altogither doteth, and is become ſecure; but fill thou our harts with true peace, wherewith we may ſtaie our ſelues in the combate of conſcience, fighting before the iudgment of God. And in our agonies, when a ſeparation ſhall be made both of ſoule and bodie; then giue vs grace to be mindfull of this thy ſaieng; Let not your harts be greeued; I go, and come againe vnto you.
                           
                           Let not thy comfortable preſence depart from our ſoule: thou wilt certainlie come againe, euen to raiſe vs from the dead, to place vs in thy kingdome. Wherfore we reioice at thy departure vnto thy Father. For the Father is greater than thou. Thou haſt prepared a place, and bleſſed manſion in the houſe of thy Father, exalted to the right hand of the Father, and haſt reſpect of the perſon ſent euen till the conſummation of the world. Ceaſe not to applie the merits of thy ſacrifice

vnto vs, make continuall interceſſion for vs. Thou abideſt our King and Prieſt, vntill thou deliuereſt the kingdome to thy Father. And therefore as a Mediator thou dooſt verelie obtaine thoſe good things, which thou haſt promiſed to all beleeuers.
                           Thou valiantlie didſt conquer Sathan, to make vs parteners of thy victorie. Thou willinglie gaueſt thy life, that it might ſatiſfie for manie. Thou waſt obedient to thine eternall Father, in the race of thine humiliation, that by thy death we might liue. Wherefore, ſeale within vs this faith and righteouſneſſe; grant that continuallie we may retaine thy ſaiengs in our minds; that we may enioie thy peace, and keepe a place for thy diuinitie in our harts, while we liue in this world, through our firſt fruits, and ſo hereafter in the life to come, we ſhall attaine the tenths, and be made like vnto thee, beholding God face to face: So be it.
                           
                        
                        
                           Another meditation and thanks-giuing, for the good effects that the holie Ghost worketh in vs by his comming.
                           
                              AL poſſible praiſe and thanks I yeeld vnto thee, O God heauenlie Father, and vnto thy deere Sonne Ieſus Chriſt my Sauiour, for ſending downe thy ſpirit of truth our comforter, ſanctifier, and regenerator, the holie Ghoſt into this world. The which thing verelie I beleeue thou didſt for this onelie end and purpoſe, that bicauſe the grape of thy ſonne our Sauiour Chriſts fleſh was caried to the wine-preſſe of the Croſſe, and there being preſſed, yeelded foorth the ſweet wine of his Godhead: it pleaſed thee therefore of thy great mercie to ſend the ſame thy holie Ghoſt, to make readie the veſſels of mens harts, that the new wine might be put into new

veſſels: firſt to ſeaſon their harts from marring of the wine that ſhould be put into them, and afterward to hoope them well for leaking, when the wine was powred into them: that is to ſaie; to clenſe them from delighting in ſinne, and to bind them from delighting in vanitie. For that which is good, could not come in, till that which is euill, was firſt rid out.
                           Oh woonderfull worke! Oh vnſpeakable benefit of thy ſurpaſſing goodneſſe and mercie, moſt woorthie of all praiſe, that man on earth, or Angels in heauen may giue or render! The holie name of thy ſacred Maieſtie be therefore bleſſed, magnified, and extolled, for euer and euer, Amen. And now, O gratious God, and good Father, I moſt humblie and intirelie beſeech thee, that for as much as delighting in wickedneſſe (which is to loue ſinne) doth defile vs, and make our veſſels fowle; yea leadeth to death: and that the delighting in vanitie (which is to be in loue with tranſitorie things of this world) ſheddeth out, and maketh the veſſell of our bodies full of crannies and rifts, yea intiſeth and deceiueth vs to our deſtruction; it may pleaſe thee therefore of thine ancient and accuſtomed mercie and goodneſſe, to giue me grace to caſt out the thing that is euill in me, that I may be fit to take in and receiue the thing that is good in thee, and ſo to powre out all ſowerneſſe of ſinne and wickedneſſe, that I may be filled with the ſweetneſſe of all vertue and godlineſſe.
                           Yea, doo thou thy ſelfe, O gratious Father (euen with the ſame thy bleſſed finger, and mightie power, wherewith in times paſt by thy ſonne Chriſt Jeſus thou didſt rebuke and throwe the diuels and vncleane ſpirits foorth of thoſe that were poſſeſſed,) vouchſafe alſo I beſeech thee, of the ſame thy ſingular loue and pitie, to caſt out of me the fowle ſpirit of the diuell, which worketh delight in wickedneſſe, and is the occaſion of faults: yea ſo, and in ſuch ſort to abandon him,

that he, nor anie of his, may euer returne into my veſſell anie more to dwell therein. I beſeech thee furthermore, to expell foorth of my veſſell, the ſpirit of this world, which worketh delight in vanitie, and is a fault of it ſelfe; that I be neuer intiſed, nor deceiued anie more therewith hereafter. Finallie, I humblie praie thee to throwe out of me all other euill and vncleane ſpirits whatſoeuer, which are noiſome enimies to my ſoule and ſaluation: and grant that thy ſpirit, O God, euen the holie Ghoſt, I meane, with all the fruits, gifts, vertues, and graces thereof, may vouchſafe to come and enter into the tabernacle of mine hart and mind, to worke in me good delights, & good loue, whereby the loue of the world, and the loue of ſinne, may bee vtterlie driuen awaie from me for euer: and my mind be continuallie inlightened; my conſcience ſtill clenſed; mine hart euer gladded; and thou thy ſelfe, my GOD, my Sanctifier and Sauiour, be more and more ſhewed, and made manifeſt vnto me,
                           Amen.
                        
                        
                           A Thanks-giuing vnto God for our regeneration and ſanctification, not vnproper to be vſed alſo at publike Baptiſme.
                           
                              O God the holie Ghoſt, which proceedeſt from the Father & the Sonne, and with them art woorſhipped and glorified in the vnitie of the true and eternall Deitie, and art alſo the ſubſtantiall amitie betweene the Father and the Sonne, we worſhip thee, we praiſe and glorifie thee, and with our whole hart we thanke thee for all thy benefits, eſpeciallie for calling vs by the voice of thy Goſpell, vnto the Chriſtian congregation, for illuminating vs with thy gifts; for ſanctifieng vs with a ſtedfaſt faith; and for keeping vs hitherto in the ſame. For by

the fount of the wholeſome lauour, that is, by the water of holie Baptiſme, being powred into vs, thou dooeſt continuallie worke in vs regeneration and renewing of the inward man. Harken, we beſeech thee, vnto our ſupplication, and teach vs miſerable women, which by the proper ſtrength of our onlie reaſon, can by no meanes truſt in, or approch to Chriſt our Lord and Sauiour: teach vs, O our God, what thy pleaſure is, and leade vs into all truth. For without thine aſſiſtance, none can ſaie that Ieſus is the Lord.
                           O bleſſed Lampe of light, fill the inward parts of the faithfull with the holie oile of thy manifold heauenlie gifts and graces, without the which nothing is light and pleaſant in man, but euerie thing darke, obſcure, and hurtfull. Waſh thou that is filthie; water that is drie; heale that is wounded; bow the obſtinate; cheriſh the froſen; and reclaime them which wander. Giue to the faithfull truſting in thee, the reward of wel-doing, the entrance into happines and euerlaſting comfort. Thou in thy gifts ſeauen-fold, which art the ſpirit of the Lord, the ſpirit of wiſedome and vnderſtanding, the ſpirit of counſell and ſtrength, the ſpirit of knowledge, and of the feare of the Lord; inſpire into vs through the preaching of the Goſpell, thine heauenlie wiſedome about thine eſſence and dinine pleaſure, which is hid from the world. Grant that we may knowe the Father and the Sonne by thee, and may alwaies beleeue that thou art the ſpirit of them both, & ſo worſhip one God in Trinitie, and the Trinitie in vnitie, whoſe will is, that not one ſhould periſh, but be conuerted & liue; and that as manie as beleeue in the Sonne, ſhould haue euerlaſting life. For the Father ſent the Sonne, not to condemne the world, but that the world through him might be ſaued.
                           O lightener of the mind, powre vpon vs thy new light, and purge the horrible darkenes of our minds,

ſo that we may ſee & knowe our chiefe Father, whome pure eies onlie doo behold. O thou heauenlie comforter, giue vnto vs a teſtimonie, and grant vnto our minds a token of the certaintie of our beleefe, ſo that we doubt not, neither wauer about thy diuine goodnes towards vs. Make our harts quiet and ſecure, that with a full truſt and confidence we may approch to the throne of thy heauenlie grace, receiuing by adoption the right of children; and inflamed with ſpirituall ioie in all boldneſſe and libertie, may crie Abba, Father.
                           
                           Thou moſt faithfull aduocate, ſtrengthen vs againſt all the aſſaults and temptations of ſathan, ſo that we may neuer doubt of thy diuine prouidence and predeſtination, whereby we are choſen and called in Chriſt vnto euerlaſting life; and neuer being ſtroken with a ſeruile feare, and oppreſſed with dreadfull doubtings, may in a rage flee and forſake our God. O ſurpaſſing comforter, leaue vs not deſtitute of thine aid and patronage; but vouchſafe euermore to be preſent with vs in our croſſes & troubles, leaſt otherwiſe we faint: but rather make vs to reioice in tribulations, knowing that a crowne of life is laid vp for ſuch as loue him. O thou teacher of men, inſtruct vs how, and what we ought to praie for, according to thy will, that we may be heard; and make thou interceſſion for vs with ſighes that can not be expreſſed.
                           O thou cleanſer of the heart, giue vs the ſimplicitie of mind without gall and bitternes, which deſcendedſt in Iordan vpon our Lord and Sauiour Chriſt in the likenes of a dooue, that we may be void of bitter enuie and contention in our harts, and haue no roote among vs, that bringeth foorth gall and woormewood. O thou ſubſtantiall flame, proceeding from the breaſt of the Father, and his eternall Sonne, lighten our harts with the fire of chaſte and burning loue. Thou which appearedſt as vpon this daie at the feaſt of Pentecoſt

vnto the Apoſtles in clouen tongs like fire, ſee our coldneſſe, and comfort vs with thy quickening heate and breathings, that we may receiue thy chriſme and annointment. O thou gheſt of the ſoule, make thee a manſion place within the ſecret parts of our hearts, that we may be an houſe for thy diuinitie, which may dwell perpetuallie in our members, and neuer depart from vs, through our Lord & Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt,
                           Amen.
                        
                        
                           A thanks-giuing.
                           
                              WE lift vp our harts vnto thee, O Lord GOD. For it is verie meet, right, and our bounden dutie, that we ſhould at all times, and in all places giue thanks vnto thee, O Lord holie Father, the almightie, euerlaſting GOD, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord; according to whoſe moſt true promiſe, the holie Ghoſt came downe this daie from heauen, with a ſudden great ſound, as it had beene a mightie wind; in the likenes of fierie tongues, lighting vpon the Apoſtles, to teach them, and lead them to all truth, giuing them both the gift of diuers languages, and alſo boldneſſe, with feruent zeale conſtantlie to preach thy Goſpell vnto all nations, whereby we are brought out of darkneſſe and errour into the cleere light and true knowledge of thee, and of thy Sonne Ieſus Chriſt. Therefore with Angels, and Archangels, & with all the bleſſed cōpanie of heauen, we laud and magnifie thy glorious name, euermore praiſing thee, and ſaieng, Holie holie holie Lord God of hoſts: heauen and earth are full of thy glorie. Glorie be to thee, O Lord moſt high: So be it.
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                        12. On Trinitie Sundaie. An acknowledgement of the almightie Trinitie, and his vndiuided God-head, eſſence, power and maieſtie.

                              WHen Ieſus was baptiſed in the water; lo, the heauens opened, and the ſpirit of God deſcended like a dooue, and lighted vpon him: and behold, there came a voice from heauen, ſaieng; This is my deerlie beloued Sonne, in whom I am well pleaſed.
                           Holie, holie, holie; Lord God almightie. Halleluiah.
                           
                           There are three, which beare record in heauen; the Father, the Word, and the holie Ghoſt, and theſe three are one.
                           Holie, holie, holie; Lord God of Saboth. Halleluiah.
                           
                        
                        
                           The Praier.
                           
                              O Moſt high Trinitie, one onlie power, and vndefiled maieſtie, our God, God almightie, the beholder and ſearcher of mine hart, I the abiect and hindmoſt of all thy ſeruants, confeſſe and acknowledge thee, and being the leaſt member of thy Church, I woorſhip thee with a due ſacrifice of praiſe, for ſo much as I am able and can, according to that which thou haſt vouchſafed to endue me withall. And foraſmuch as I am deſtitute of outward gifts to offer vnto thee, thoſe vowes of praiſe which I haue of the gift of thy mercie, behold willinglie and gladlie I offer them vnto thee, which be an vnfeigned faith, and a pure conſcience.
                           I beleeue therefore with all my hart, O king of heauen, and Lord of the earth, and with my mouth doo I

confeſſe thee, the Father, the Sonne, and the holie Ghoſt, to be three perſons, and one in ſubſtance; the true and verie God almightie, of one ſimple, incorporall, and inuiſible nature, incomprehenſible, and of ſuch a nature, as is not in a place as other natures be, and that thou haſt nothing ſuperiour or aboue thy ſelfe, or lower, or anie thing bigger than thy ſelfe, but in all manner of meanes perfect, without all ſpot of deformitie. And that thou art great without quantitie; good without qualitie; euerlaſting without time; life without death; ſtrong without infirmitie or weakeneſſe; true without lieng; preſent in euerie place without anie ſituation, or being placed in anie place, to be all euerie where without place; fulfilling all things without ſtretching foorth thy hand; going euerie where without anie contradiction or gaine-ſaieng; paſſing ouer all things without mouing; abiding in all things without anie kind of proportion; making all things, hauing need of nothing; gouerning all things without labour; giuing all things their beginning, hauing no beginning thy ſelfe; making all things mutable and variable, thy ſelfe being without all kind of mutabilitie and variableneſſe.
                           I confeſſe thee to be in greatneſſe without meaſure; in power almightie; in goodnes the cheefe and beſt; in wiſedome ineſtimable; in counſelles, intents, and purpoſes terrible and fearefull; in iudgements moſt vpright and iuſt; in cogitations and thoughts moſt ſecret; in words true; in works holie; in mercies aboundant and plentifull; toward offenders moſt patient; towards the penitent, and thoſe that be hartilie ſorie for their ſinnes moſt gentle & louing; alwaies the ſame, euerlaſting, and continuallie continuing, immortall, and incommutable, impoſſible to be changed or altered.
                           Whome neither the amplitude or largenes of places

doth make bigger, nor the ſhortneſſe or littleneſſe of places make leſſer, nor anie places or corners can conteine or preſſe togither. Neither doth thy will or intent varie or alter, nor familiaritie or acquaintance corrupt thee, nor ſorrowfull things trouble or amaze thee, nor glad things make thee pleaſant or frolike as a man would ſaie. For from thee can forgetfulnes take nothing, nor mindfulnes or remembrance giue anie thing. Neither are things paſſed vnto vs, paſſed alſo vnto thee; nor things which to vs are to come, to come towards thee. For neither beginning doth giue anie beginning to thee, nor time anie increaſe, nor yet chance giueth thee anie end; but before all worlds, and in all worlds, and by worlds into euerlaſting thou dooeſt liue, and thou haſt continuall praiſe and perpetuall glorie; moſt high power, and ſingular honor; euerlaſting kingdome, and rule, and empire without end, through the infinite, and vnwearie, and immortall world of worlds.
                        
                        
                           Another meditation of the right beleefe in the vnitie of perſons and pluralitie in God.
                           
                           
                              THeſe, and much mo things haue I learned of the holie mother the Church, whereof through thy grace I am made a member. Of hir haue learned how thou the alone and true God, both haſt no bodie, and alſo art vnſubiect to paſſions, & how nothing of thy ſubſtance or nature is anie waie violable, or changeable, or compounded, or created: and therefore certaine it is, how thou canſt neither be perceiued by anie bodilie eies, nor could euer be ſeene in the proper nature of anie mortall man. For hence it may euidentlie be gathered, that where Angels doo now behold thee, there we alſo after this

life ſhall ſee thee, naie, the verie Angels neither are able to ſee thee as thou art in thy ſelfe, naïe to conclude, the almightie Trinitie is knowne to none but onlie to thy ſelfe, O bleſſed Trinitie.
                           And thou, an vnitie of the God-head, through the pluralitie of perſons manifold, art in number infinite, and therefore meaſurablie vnmeaſurable, and waightily vnwaiable. For we knowledge no beginning of the ſouereigne goodneſſe, the which thou art, of whome, through whome, in whom are all things, but through participation thereof we ſaie all good things are. For thy diuine eſſence hath alwaies been, and yet is without matter, although it lacke no forme, to wit, informed, the forme of formes, the moſt welformed forme, the which while thou imprinteſt as a ſeale to euerie particular thing, thou makeſt them doubtleſſe to differ from thy ſelfe, without any either of your augmenting, or diminiſhing, but whatſoeuer is in the world it is thy creature.
                           O ſimple Trinitie, and triple vnitie, God, whoſe almightineſſe both poſſeſſeth, and ruleth, and repleniſheth all things which thou haſt created. Neither in ſaieng how thou filleſt all things, meane we that they conteine thee, but rather that thou conteineſt them; neither by parts filleſt thou all things, nor yet may it be thought, that euerie thing, according to the greatneſſe of the portion it hath, receiueth thee, that is, the greateſt thing more, and the ſmalleſt thing leſſe, thou rather being in all things, or more trulie, all things in thee, whoſe omnipotencie includeth all things. Neither can any man find a waie to eſcape thy power. For whoſoeuer hath not thy fauour, can by no meanes auoid thy diſpleſure, as it is written, Neither from the Eaſt, nor from the Weſt, nor from the South, but God is the iudge. And againe, Whither ſhall I go frō thy ſpirit? Or whither ſhall I go from thy preſence?
                           
                              
The immenſitie of thy diuine greatneſſe is this, that we knowe thee to be within all things, not as included; and without all things, yet not as excluded. And therefore thou art within, that thou maiſt containe all; and therfore without, that all things may be comprehended within the immenſitie of thine vncircumſcribed greatneſſe. So then by that thou art within, thou art knowne to be a Creator; by that thou art without, we perceiue how thou art the gouernour of all things. And leaſt all things, which are created might be without thee, thou art within and without, that all things may be included of thee, not by locall greatneſſe, but by thy mightie preſence, who art euerie-where preſent, and all things preſent before thee: although ſome vnderſtand theſe things, yet ſome doo not.
                           The vnitie then of thine inſeparable nature, can not haue ſeparable perſons; bicauſe, as thou art a Trinitie in vnitie, and an vnitie in Trinitie; ſo can you not haue a ſeparation of perſons. Sometimes indeed, thoſe perſons are particularlie named; but ſo thou wouldeſt, O God the Trinitie, declare thy ſelfe inſeparable in perſons; that there is no name in anie one perſon, but may be referred vnto another, according to the rule of relation: as the Father vnto the Sonne, & the Sonne vnto the Father; ſo hath the holie Ghoſt true relation both vnto the Father & the Sonne. Alſo, thoſe names, which ſignifie either your ſubſtance, O GOD, or perſon, or power, or eſſence, or elſe what, which properlie is called God, doo equalliie agree to all the perſons: as great God, almightie, eternall, and generallie all things, which naturalle are ſpoken of God. So that there is no name of nature, which ſo maie agree vnto thee, God the Father, but the ſame alſo may fitlie be referred vnto the Sonne, and holie Ghoſt.
                           
                              
We ſaie how thou the Father art naturallie God; ſo is the Sonne naturallie God, and the holie Ghoſt naturallie: and yet not three Gods; but one God naturallie, the Father, the Sonne, and the holie Ghoſt. And therefore, O God holie Trinitie, in perſons thou art inſeparable; in ſenſe are they to be vnderſtood, though in ſound you haue ſeparable names. For you receiue no plurall number in the nature. For hereby it is declared, how the perſons in the holie Trinitie, which is one verie God, can not be diuided: for that the name of euerie perſon, reſpecteth alwaie another perſon. If I ſay the Father, I point vnto the Sonne; if I name the Sonne, I preſuppoſe a Father; if I mention the holie Spirit, I muſt neceſſarilie vnderſtand of whom he is the Spirit; namelie, of the Father, and of the Sonne. For this is the true faith, proceeding from ſound doctrine: this vndoubtedlie is the catholike and right faith, which God of his goodneſſe hath taught me in the boſome of the mother Church.
                        
                        
                           The faith or beleefe of a true Chriſtian, concerning the bleſsed Trinitie, most notablie deſcribed.
                           
                              O My light, I praiſe thee for inlightening mee, whereby I knowe thee; but how do I knowe thee? I knowe thee to be God alone, a liuing God, a true God, my Creator. I knowe thee to be the maker both of heauen and earth, of all things viſible and inuiſible, a verie GOD, almightie, immortall, inuiſible, vncompaſſable, vnlimitable, euerlaſting, to whom none can approch vnto, nor comprehend, nor find out; who art vnchangable, vnmeaſurable, infinite, the beginning of all creatures, be they viſible or inuiſible, by whom all things were created;

through whom all the elements doo conſiſt: whoſe maieſtie, as it neuer had beginning; ſo it ſhall neuer haue end.
                           I knowe thee to be one God alone, the true God; namelie, the eternall Father, Sonne, and holie Ghoſt; three perſons indeed, but one ſimple ſubſtance, and vnparted nature; the Father made of none; the Sonne of the Father alone; the holie Ghoſt of the Father and of the Sonne; alwaies without either beginning or end. A Trinitie, yet but one onlie, and verie God, omnipotent; the onelie beginning of all things, maker of all creatures, both viſible and inuiſible, ſpirituall and temporall, which by thine almightie power at the beginning diddeſt of nothing make togither, both creatures, ſpirituall & corporall, that is to ſaie, Angelicall and worldlie, and after the humane, as a middle nature conſiſting of bodie and ſpirit.
                           I knowe and confeſſe thee GOD the Father, to be vnbegotten; thee God the Sonne, to be begotten of the Father; thee God the holie Ghoſt the comforter, to be neither made, nor begotten. With mine hart I beleeue vnto righteouſneſſe, and with my mouth I confeſſe vnto ſaluation, this holie and ſingle Trinitie, in the three coequall, conſubſtantiall, and coeternall perſons, to be a Trinitie in vnitie, and an vnitie in Trinitie.
                           I knowe thee Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, to be a true God, the onlie begotten Sonne of God, and the Creator, Sauiour, and Redeemer, not of me onelie, but alſo of all mankind: whom I acknowledge to be begotten of the Father before all worlds, God of GOD, light of light, verie God of verie God, begotten, not made, being of one ſubſtance, and coeternall with the Father and the holie Ghoſt, by whom all things at the beginning were made: ſtedfaſtlie beleeuing, and trulie confeſſing, that thou Ieſus Chriſt, the onelie begotten

Sonne of God, for our ſaluation, by the conſent of the whole Trinitie tookeſt fleſh; and wert conceiued by the holie Ghoſt, of the virgin Marie, and wert made verie man, of a reaſonable ſoule, and humane fleſh ſubſiſting.
                           Thou, for ſo much as in reſpect of thy God-head, being the onlie begotten Sonne of God, thou couldeſt neither ſuffer, nor die, through thine exceeding loue, wherewith thou haſt loued vs. Thou, the verie ſame Sonne of God, for all that, becameſt ſubiect to ſufferings, and mortalitie, in reſpect of thy manhood: and, O onlie Sonne of God, for the ſaluation of mankind didſt ſuffer death vpon the wood of the Croſſe, to ſaue vs from euerlaſting death. Thou, the author of light, deſcendedſt into hell, and like a glorious conqueror, roſeſt againe the third daie, taking to thee againe thy ſacred bodie, which for our ſinnes had lien in the ſepulchre; and quickening it according to the ſcripture the third daie, that thou mighteſt place the ſame at the right hand of the Father.
                           For thou, the verie Sonne of God, taking againe vnto thy ſelfe the ſubſtance of our fleſh, that is to ſaie, the ſoule and humane bodie, which thou tookeſt of the glorious virgin, art aſcended vp aboue all the heauens, and mounted aboue the orders of Angels, where thou ſitteſt at the right hand of God the Father, and whereas the fountaine of life is; the light which none can attaine vnto: and the peace of God, which paſſeth all vnderſtanding. There we doo worſhip thee; there we doo beleeue thee to be the verie God, and verie man; confeſſing God to be thy Father, and from thence wee looke, that thou wilt come a Iudge in the end of the world, to iudge both the quicke and the dead, and to render to all men, good and bad, according to their deeds, which they haue done in this life, either reward or puniſhment, according as euerie one is woorthie,

reſt or torment. For all men, euen as manie as haue receiued ſoules in their humane fleſh, which they had in this world, ſhall riſe at that daie, through the ſound of thy power: that whole man may receiue either the glorie of heauen, or the paine of hell, according to his deſerts. Thou art our reſurrection, and the life it ſelfe, whom we looke for; euen the Lord Ieſus Chriſt our Sauiour, who ſhail change our vile bodie, that it may be faſhioned like vnto his glorious bodie.
                           I knowe thee the holie Spirit, both of the Father and of the Sonne, to be one God, and a verie GOD, proceeding alike from them both, of one ſubſtance, and coeternall with the Father and the Sonne, our comforter, and aduocate: which cameſt downe in the likeneſſe of a dooue vpon the ſame God, and our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and ſhewedſt thy ſelfe vpon thine Apoſtles in fierie tongues: which alſo euen from the beginning haſt inſtructed, with the gift of thy grace, all the Saints and choſen of God; and opened the mouthes of the Prophets, that they might declare abroad the woonderfull myſteries of the kingdome of God; who alſo togither with the Father and the Sonne, of all the Saints of God art worſhipped and glorified. Among whom I thine handmaid doo glorifie thy name, bicauſe thou haſt inlightened me. For thou art the verie light; the true light; the fire of God; the maiſter of ſpirits, which by thine ointment teacheſt vs all truth, the Spirit of truth, without which it is impoſſible to pleaſe God. For thou thy ſelfe art God of God, and light of light, vnſpeakablie proceeding from the Father of lights, and from his Sonne our Lord Ieſu Chriſt, with whom thou reigneſt and art glorified moſt ſingularlie, being of one ſubſtance, coequall, and coeternall with them in the eſſence of one and the ſame Trinitie.
                           I knowe thee Father, Sonne, and holie Ghoſt, to be

one, a liuing, and a verie God: three I confeſſe in perſons, yet but one in eſſence; whom I acknowledge, worſhip, and glorifie with mine whole hart, being the true God, the onlie God, holie, immortall, inuiſible, vnchangable, whom no man can either attaine vnto, or find out. This God I acknowledge to be one light, one ſunne, one bread, one life, one happineſſe, one beginning, one end, one Creator both of heauen and earth, by whom all things doo liue; by whom all things ſubſiſt; by whom all things are gouerned, ruled, and quickened, both the things in heauen, and the things in earth, & things vnder the earth: beſides whom there is no God, neither in heauen, nor in earth.
                           Thus knowe I thee, O bleſſed Trinitie, my Lord God, who knoweſt me. Thus knowe I thee, through the faith, which thou haſt inſpired to me. I knowe thee O my light, the ſight of mine eies, O Lord my GOD, the hope of all the ends of the earth: the ioie reioicing my youth, and the good ſuſteining mine age. For in thee, O Lord, all my bones reioice, ſaieng; O Lord, who is like to thee? Among the gods, who is like to thee? Not that whom the hands of men haue made; but thou who haſt made the hands of men. The idols of the nations are ſiluer and gold, euen the works of mens hands: ſo is not he which made man. All the gods of the people are idols; but the Lord made the heauens. Let thoſe gods, which made not the heauens, and the earth, periſh from the earth, and from vnder theſe heauens; but let both heauen and earth praiſe him, which created both earth and heauen,
                           Amen.
                        
                        
                           A zealous praier vnto the bleſſed Trinitie.
                           
                              WHerefore, O Lord, my faith, which thou haſt giuen me to my ſaluation, calleth vnto thee. For the faithfull ſoule liueth by faith; he enioieth in hope, which one daie he ſhall behold

in thee. O my God, vnto thee crieth my pure conſcience, and the ſweet loue of my faith, which the darkenes of ignorance being driuen away, thou haſt brought vnto the knowledge of the truth: which alſo thou haſt plucked from the fooliſh bitternes of this world, and made comfortable and pleaſant to me through thy ſweet loue.
                           Unto thee, O bleſſed Trinitie, doth the cleere voice and ſincere loue of my faith call, the which nouriſhing the ſame from the cradle, thou haſt inlightned alwaie by the light of thy grace, & confirmed mightilie in me through the inſtructions of our mother the Church. Unto thee doo I call, O happie, bleſſed, glorious, and ſingle Trinitie, Father, Sonne, and holie Ghoſt; God, Lord, and Comforter; loue, grace, and communion; the begetter, the begotten, the renewer; the verie light of the verie light, the verie illumination, the ſpring, the floud, and the watering: of one, all; through one, all; in one, all things: of whome, through whome, and in whome are all things. The liuing life, the life from the liuing, the quickener of ſuch as liue. One of himſelfe; one of one; one of two. A being of himſelfe; a being of another; a being from both. The Father is true, the Sonne truth, and the holie Ghoſt truth: ſo that the Father, the Word, & the Comforter, are one eſſence, one power, one goodnes, and one bleſſednes; of whom, through whome, and in whome, all things be bleſſed, whatſoeuer things are bleſſed. I beſeech thee therefore, that as thou haſt giuen me grace, by the confeſſion of a true faith, to acknowledge the glorie of the eternall Trinitie, and in the power of the diuine maieſtie, to worſhip the vnitie: ſo grant, that through the ſtedfaſtneſſe of this faith, I may euermore be preſerued, comforted & defended in all my troubles & aduerſities; which liueſt and reigneſt, three perſons and one God, bleſſed for euer,
                           Amen.
                        
                        
                           
                           Another deuout praier to the holie Trinitie.
                           
                              WIth all my hart and mouth doo I confeſſe, praiſe, & bleſſe thee O God the Father vnbegotten, and thee O God the Sonne onlie begotten, alſo thee O holie Ghoſt & Comforter; to thee be glorie in the world of worlds, Amen.
                           
                           O bleſſed Trinitie, thou three coequall and coeternall perſons, and one verie God, the Father, Sonne, and holie Ghoſt, who dwelleſt alone in euerlaſtingnes, and in vnapprochable light, which haſt founded the earth by thy mightie power, and ruleſt the whole world by thy wiſedome. Holie holie holie Lord God of hoaſts, dreadfull, ſtrong, righteous, mercifull, maruellous, praiſe-woorthie, to be beloued, one God, three perſons, one being, power, wiſedome, goodnes, and one vnſpeakable Trinitie: I crie vnto thee. Open me the gates of righteouſnes, and when I am come in, I will praiſe thee O Lord. Behold, I poore begger knocke at thy doore; O ſouereigne houſholder, command the gates to be opened at my knocking, according as thou haſt ſaid; Knocke yee, and it ſhall be opened.
                           For trulie, O moſt mercifull Father, the deſires of my groning hart, and the cries of my weeping eies, doo knocke at thy doore. All my deſire is before thee, and my groning is not hid from thee. Lord turne not thy face anie more awaie from me, neither fling thou awaie from thy ſeruant in a fume. O Father of mercies, heare the howling out of thy Ward, and reach hir thy ſingular good helping hand, that it may drawe me out of the deepe waters, and out of the lake of miſerie, and out of the mire of filthines, that I periſh not; thy pitifull eies ſeeing it, and the bowels of thy mercie beholding

it, but that I may wade out vnto thee my Lord God, ſo as I may ſee the riches of thy kingdome, and alwaies behold thy face, and ſing praiſes to thy holie name, O Lord, which workeſt woonders, which cheereſt my hart with remembring thee, and which inlighteneſt my youth: deſpiſe not mine old age, but make my bones to reioice, and my hoarie heares to waxe freſh againe as the Eagle.
                        
                        
                           A Thanks-giuing.
                           
                              WE lift vp our harts vnto thee O Lord, for it is verie meet, right, and our bounden duties, that we ſhould at all times and in all places giue thanks to thee O God almightie, and euerlaſting God, which art one God, one Lord; not one onelie perſon, but three perſons in one ſubſtance. For that which we beleeue of the glorie of the Father, the ſame we beleeue of the Sonne, and of the holie Ghoſt, without anie difference, or inequalitie. Therefore with Angels and Archangels, and with all the companie of heauen, we laud and magnifie thy glorious name, euermore praiſing thee, and ſaieng, Holie holie holie Lord God of hoaſts; heauen and earth are full of thy glorie. Glorie be to thee O Lord moſt high, and in earth peace, good will towards men. We praiſe thee, we bleſſe thee, we woorſhip thee, we glorifie thee, we giue thanks to thee for thy great glorie, O Lord God heauenlie King, God the Father almightie, O Lord the onlie begotten Sonne Ieſu Chriſt. O Lord God, Lambe of God, Sonne of the Father, that takeſt awaie the ſinnes of the world, haue merrie vpon vs. Thou that takeſt awaie the ſinnes of the world, haue mercie vpon vs. Thou that takeſt awaie the ſinnes of the world, receiue our praiers. Thou that

ſitteſt at the right hand of God the Father, haue mercie vpon vs. For thou onlie art holie, thou onlie art the Lord, thou onlie O Chriſt, with the holie Ghoſt, art moſt high in the glorie of God the Father; to whome be all kingdome, power, honor and glorie world without end,
                           Amen.
                        
                     
                     
                        13. On euerie Sundaie, holidaie, or weekedaie. Of Christ his ſecond and last comming to iudgement.
                           
                        
                        
                           The Preface.
                           
                              THE kingdome of heauen is neere at hand, euen at the doores. Take heed, watch and praie.
                           The ſonne of man ſhall come as a theefe in the night ſuddenlie and vnwares, at an houre that ye knowe not. Take heed, watch and praie.
                           Euen Ieſus, which was taken vp from vs into heauen, ſhall ſo come againe to gather vs vnto him, as he was ſeene to haue gone into heauen. Come Lord Ieſu.
                           
                           Behold, he commeth with clowdes, and euerie eie ſhall ſee him, yea euen they which pierced him through, and all kindreds of the earth ſhall vaile before him. Come Lord Ieſu.
                           
                           Our God ſhall come, and ſhall not keepe ſilence: there ſhall go before him a conſuming fire, and burne vp his enimies on euerie ſide: the hilles ſhall melt like waxe at the preſence of the Lord, & a mightie tempeſt ſhall be ſtirred vp round about him. Come Lord Ieſu.
                           
                           He commeth, he commeth to iudge the earth, and with righteouſneſſe to iudge the world, and the people with equitie and truth. Come Lord Ieſu.
                           
                           Therefore yet a verie little while O my ſoule, take heed, watch & praie; and he that ſhall come, will come, and will not tarrie. Come Lord Ieſu.
                           
                           
                              
Surelie I come ſhortlie ſaith Chriſt, and my reward is with me, to giue to euerie one according as his works ſhall be, either good or bad. For I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the firſt and the laſt. Bleſſed are they that watch; and keepe my commandements vnto the end. Come Lord Ieſu.
                           
                           Euen ſo ſaith the ſpirit and the bride. Come Lord Ieſu, come quicklie:
                           
                           Amen, Amen.

                              BEholding, O heauenlie Father, the daie of accompts ouer all fleſh to be euen now at hand, namelie the laſt daie, the daie of iudgement, the great and notable daie of the Lord, wherein the whole generation of mankind, from the beginning of the world, ſhall riſe againe, & ſhall appeare both in bodie and ſoule, before the preſence of the moſt iuſt iudge thine eternall Sonne, and our righteous God, to receiue their owne doome for weale or wo, for life or death, for ioie or paine, and that eternallie with the ſaincts in heauen, or for euer with the diuels in hell: we beſeech thee moſt humblie, O gratious God, to haue mercie vpon all thine inheritance diſperſed in theſe our euill and dangerous daies, in the midſt of this wicked, moſt ſinfull, and vntoward generation, vpon the face of the earth, amongſt whome we are moſt miſerablie entangled, contemned, cruellie dealt withall, and ſtirred to all abhominations.
                           O heauenlie Father, we acknowledge before thee, in

our ſelues the greatneſſe of our owne frailtie, our corrupted luſt to lewdneſſe, the fulneſſe in our ſelues of our owne iniquitie, and our accuſtomed inclination at all times to wickedneſſe. O Father of mercies, tender vs in our weakenes; haue compaſſion vpon our infirmities, pardon our ſinfulneſſe, and grant vnto vs thine holie ſpirit, to worke ſpeedie mortification in vs, to keepe lowe the pride of our fleſh, to humble our ſoules in thy ſight, to ſtrengthen vs in righteouſneſſe, to feare alwaies thy iudgements, to thinke vpon thy wrathfull indignation, and vpon the houre of the vengeance to come, when thou for our wickedneſſe ſhalt turne awaie thy face from vs.
                           Haue mercie vpon vs, O Lord, haue mercie vpon vs, for Chriſt Ieſus thy Sonne ſake; and ſo prepare all our harts, ſoules, and bodies, to the neceſſitie of the time, that we may haue therein good regard to our ſelues, that our harts be not ouercharged with exceſſe of eating, ſurfeting, and dronkenneſſe, or otherwiſe vexed with the cares of this wretched world, to hinder vs, and to drawe vs backe from our carefull attendance, or diligent waiting for the Lords ſudden comming to iudgement; but that we may continuallie attend, wait, watch and praie for the ſpeedie appeerance of his glorious Maieſtie, that when he ſhall at the riſing againe of all fleſh, by the ſound of the laſt trumpet, come to iudge both the quicke and the dead, we may be then in a readineſſe to meet him aboue in the heauens, and there to ſtand before his preſence, to behold the glorie of his moſt gratious countenance, to ſee how in mercie he ſhall ſeparate vs from the wicked, as ſheepe from the goates, to ſet vs alſo on his right hand, to giue the ſentence of bleſſing vpon vs, and to commend vs vnto the kingdome of thee his heauenlie Father, which he himſelfe hath prepared, and ſo pretiouſlie purchaſed with the price of his own

bloud, there with him, with thee, O Father, and with the holie Ghoſt, to liue in euerlaſting ioie and felicitie. Grant this, O heauenlie Father, euen for the onelie merits ſake of that thy deere Sonne, and our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt,
                           Amen.
                        
                        
                           Another meditation of the ſignes, which ſhall appeare before the end of the world.
                           
                              IT is thy ſaieng, O Sonne of God, that in the laſt and doting age of the world, both greater, and more greeuous miſeries and confuſions among men ſhould bee, than euer were; and alſo for all that, that thou which art the defender of thy Church, in the midſt of ſuch calamities and crueltie of thine enimies, wilt preſerue ſome remnant of the faithfull, that thy ſeruice be not vtterlie extinguiſhed before the end of this world. Wherefore being oppreſſed, through the intollerable burden of miſeries, heaped therefore vpon vs, bicauſe the ſins of this withering world, are moſt greeuous and lamentable: but eſpeciallie for that Sathan thine enimie ſeeth the daie of iudgement to be verie nigh at hand, wherein his abhomination ſhall openlie be laid before all thy choſen creatures, and he be caſt hedlong into eternall torments; which makes him extreamelie to rage againſt thy choſen flocke, and to ſeeke by all meanes that poſſiblie he can, to withdrawe vs from thee, and to make vs blaſpheme thy ſacred Maieſtie. Wee, as it ſtandeth vs vpon, flie vnto thee with all humbleneſſe of mind in theſe our extremities. The whole frame of this world groaneth alſo with thine elect, and earneſtlie deſireth to be renewed.
                           Therefore, according to thy gratious admonition,

we call into mind the ſignes, which ſhall come before the finall deſtruction of this world, and thanke thee for thy goodneſſe in foretelling vs of them. We lift vp our heads vnto thee, which art aloft on the right hand of the eternall Father, and in faith and praier looke for that ioifull daie, when thou wilt appeare moſt gloriouſlie in the clouds, for the deliuerance of thy people out of theſe calamities. Gouerne vs by thy word and ſpirit, O moſt mightie protector, that wee may bee watchfull, and ſhun the cares of this tranſitorie world, which withdrawe the mind from the exerciſe of godlineſſe, and choke all vertuous motions raiſed by thine holie ſpirit; and flie from wantonneſſe, bellie-cheere, and vnlawfull pleaſures, which both cauſe thy ſpirit to forſake our minds, and make our bodies the receptacles of vnpure ſpirits, whereby we are caried, being ſecure, vnto abhominable wickednes, and from thence vnto euerlaſting deſtruction.
                           Finallie, purge thou our harts by thy ſpirit, and let thy knowledge appeare in vs, which may both expell our groſſe darkneſſe, and inflame in vs godlie motions, that all the daies of our life we may continue in the true and ſincere confeſſion of thy name. And for ſo much as thou haſt promiſed to defend vs, and to mitigate our paines, grant that wee may both eſcape euils to come, and ſtand ioifullie before thee at thy returne,
                           Amen.
                        
                        
                           Another.
                           
                              ALmightie God, and moſt mercifull heauenlie Father, as in the deſtruction of Ieruſalem thou haſt left a fearefull example of thy horible iudgements againſt the contempt of the Goſpell, and the wickedneſſe of men; & threateneſt ſuch plagues to come for like wickedneſſe vpon

the world, as ſhall cauſe men to die for feare of them before they come: grant vs ſo to read thy truth, and to be obedient vnto it, that when the ſignes of theſe things ſhall come, which ſhall aſtoniſh the wicked, wee may hold vp our heads with comfort, waiting for our redemption ſo neere at hand; watch with continuall praier, that we may eſcape all theſe things which ſhall come vpon the world in that daie, and that wee may ſtand before thy Sonne, when he ſhall come to iudgement, and be receiued of him to euerlaſting glorie; to whom with thee, and the holie Ghoſt, be all honour, glorie, and praiſe, for euer and euer,
                           Amen.
                        
                        
                           A godlie meditation of the comming of Chriſt to iudgement, and of the reward both of the faithfull and vnfaithfull.
                           
                              O Lord Ieſu Chriſt, the Sonne of the euerliuing God, by whom althings were made, are ruled, and gouerned; as of thy loue for our redemption thou diddeſt not diſdaine to bee our mediator, and to take vpon thee our nature in the wombe of a virgin, purelie and without ſinne, by the operation of the holie Ghoſt, that both thou mighteſt in thine owne perſon woonderfullie beautifie and exalt our nature, and worke the ſame in vs alſo: firſt aboliſhing the guiltineſſe of ſinne by remiſſion, then ſinne it ſelfe by death; and laſt of all death, by raiſing againe theſe our bodies, that they may be like vnto thine owne glorious and immortall bodie, according to the power wherewith thou art able to ſubiect all things vnto thee. As, I ſaie, of thy loue for our redemption thou becameſt man, and that moſt poore and afflicted vpon earth, by the ſpace of three & thirtie yeeres at the leaſt, in moſt humilitie, and paiedſt the price of

our ranſome, by thy moſt bitter death and paſſion; for the which I moſt hartilie giue thanks to thee: ſo of the ſame thy loue towards vs, in thy good time, thou wilt come againe in the clouds of heauen, with power and great glorie, with flaming fire, with thouſands of Saints, with Angels of thy power, with a mightie crie, ſhowt of an Archangell, and blaſt of a trumpet ſuddenlie as a lightening, which ſhineth from the eaſt, &c. When we thinke leaſt, euen as a theefe in the night, when men be a ſleepe: thou wilt ſo come, I ſaie; thus ſuddenlie in the twinkeling of an eie; all men that euer haue beene, be, and ſhall be, with women and children, appearing before thy Tribunall iudgment ſeate, to render an account of all things, which they haue thought, ſpoken, and done againſt thy lawe, openlie, and before all Angels, Saints, and diuels: and ſo to receiue the iuſt reward of thy vengeance, if they haue not repented, and obeied thy Goſpell, and ſo depart from thee to the diuell, and his angels: and all the wicked, which euer haue beene, be, or ſhall be, into hell fire, which is vnquenchable, and of paines intollerable, endleſſe, hopeleſſe; euen from the face of thy glorious Maieſtie, and mightie power.
                           But if they haue repented, and beleeued thy Goſpell; if they be found watching like wiſe virgins, with their lamps and oile in their hands; if they be found readie apparelled with the wedding garment of innocencie; if they haue not hardened their harts, and hourded vp the treaſure of thy vengeauce, in the daie of wrath to be reuealed: but haue vſed the time of grace, the acceptable time, the time of ſaluation; that is, the time of this life, in the which thou ſtretcheſt out thy hand, and ſpreadeſt thine armes, calling and crieng vnto vs, to come vnto thee, which art meeke in hart, and lowlie. For thou wilt eaſe all that labour, and are heauie laden. If they haue viſited the ſicke and priſoners; comforted

the comfortleſſe; fed the hungrie; cloathed the naked; lodged the harbourleſſe: if they haue not loden their harts with gluttonie, and ſurfetting, and carefulneſſe of this life: if they haue not digged, and hid their talent in the ground, dooing no good therewith: but haue been faithfull to occupie thy gifts to thy glorie, and haue waſhed their garments in thy bloud by hartie repentance; then ſhall the Angels gather them togither, not as the wicked, which ſhall be collected as fagots, and caſt into the fire; but as the good wheate that is gathered into thy barne.
                           Then ſhall they be caught vp to meete thee in the clouds; then ſhall their corruptible bodie put on incorruption; then ſhall they be indued with immortalitie and glorie; then ſhall they be with thee, and go whither thou goeſt, then ſhall they heare theſe ioifull words: Come ye bleſſed of my Father, poſſeſſe the kingdome prepared for you from the beginning, &c. Then ſhall they be ſet on ſeates of Maieſtie, iudging the whole world; then ſhall they reigne with thee for euer; then ſhall God be all in all with them, and to them; then ſhall they enter, and inherit heauenlie Ieruſalem, and the glorious reſtfull land of Chanaan, where it is alwaies daie, and neuer night; where is no maner of weeping, teares, infirmitie, hunger, cold, ſickeneſſe, enuie, malice, nor ſinne: but alwaies ioie without ſorowe, mirth without meaſure; pleaſure without paine; heauenlie harmonie; moſt pleaſant melodie; ſaieng, and ſinging; Holie, holie, holie; Lord GOD of hoſts, &c. Finallie, the eie hath not ſeene; the eare hath not heard; neither hath it entered into the hart of man, that they ſhall then inherit, and moſt ſurelie enioie; although heere they bee tormented, priſoned, burned, ſolicited of Sathan, tempted of the fleſh, and intangled with the world, wherethrough they are inforced to crie; Thy kingdome come. Come Lord Ieſu &c.
                              
How amiable are thy tabernacles? Like as the hart deſireth the water brookes, ſo longeth my ſoule after thee O God. Now Lord let thy ſeruant depart in peace. I deſire to be diſſolued, and to be with Chriſt. We moorne in our ſoules, waiting for the deliuerance of our bodies, &c.
                           Oh gratious Lord, when ſhall I find ſuch mercie with thee, that I may repent, beleeue, hope, and looke for theſe things, with the full fruition of thoſe heauenlie ioies, which thou haſt promiſed and prepared for all them that feare and loue thee, and ſo reſt with thee for euermore?
                           Amen.

                                 The daie of the Lord will come as a theefe in the night, in the which the heauens ſhall paſſe awaie with a noiſe, and the element ſhall melt with heate, and the earth with the works that are therein ſhall be burnt vp.
                                 Seeing therefore that all theſe things muſt be diſſolued, what manner perſons ought yee to be in holie conuerſation and good liues, looking for the haſtning vnto the comming of God, by the which the heauens beeing on fire, ſhall be diſſolued, and the elements ſhall melt with heate!

                        1. On Saint Andrewes daie. My hart is readie, O God, my hart is readie prepared to ſéeke thée, and to followe thy Lawe: O let me not go wrong out of thy commandements.
                        
                        
                           WE thanke thee, O Sonne of God, head, and keeper of thy Church, for gathering to thy ſelfe out of the vncleane companie of men, an holie Church, which is knit to thee in true confeſſion, righteouſneſſe, and life. Manie times didſt thou repeate thy promiſe touching the bringing of man fallen, into thy fauour againe, and by the continuall preaching of thy Miniſters, haſt giuen vs the light thereof. Thou didſt in like manner appoint a tower, and ordeine the Commonwealth of Moſes in the middeſt of that part of the world inhabited, from whence it might be heard of all mankinde. At the length, thou appearedſt in the fleſh, brakeſt the bands of the old teſtament, and entredſt into a new couenant with vs, and calledſt thine holie Apoſtle Andrew, and the reſt, to be the publiſhers and witneſſes of thy truth, and gaueſt them authoritie to preach, and ſufficient teſtimonie, that they publiſh the truth. Mainteine among vs this light, that we may giue credit to thy Miniſters and their writings, as to a voice ſounding from heauen, that we may be citizens of that companie which is builded vpon the foundation of the Prophets and Apoſtles, in which building thou art

the corner ſtone, bearing the whole houſe by the word of thy power. Grant that imitating the examples of Saint Andrew, and the reſt of the holie Doctors and Apoſtles, who by thy grace readilie obeied the calling of thy Sonne. Ieſus Chriſt, and followed him without delaie, we alſo being called by thy holie word, may likewiſe foorthwith giue ouer our ſelues obedientlie to followe thee and thy holie commandements. Of them it it is ſaid, They went foorth and ſowed their ſeed with teares, but they ſhall returne with ioie. Giue alſo to thy Church in all ages for euermore, faithfull and holie teachers, which may be fiſhers of men; reteine the forme of ſound doctrine; diſpenſe thy myſteries faithfullie, and gather to thy kingdome great companies, till the number of thine elect being filled, the net ſhall be caſt off, and thy whole Church enioie thy viſible and bleſſed ſight for euermore,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        2. On Saint Thomas daie. I beléeue, O Lord, helpe mine vnbeléefe, and increaſe my faith.
                        
                        
                           LOthſome is the darkeneſſe, and horrible the ſtreames of diffidence and miſtruſt, euen in the elect, as the Apoſtle Thomas, albeit he had ſenſiblie heard the voice of the Sonne of God, & ſeene the miracles which bare teſtimonie that he taught and preached the truth: yea albeit in mind inwardlie he beheld the preſence of his Lord, yet beleeued he not the reſurrection of Chriſt, which is the principall article of our faith, neither gaue he credit to ſuch as had ſeene the Lord liuing againe: which doubting thou didſt ſuffer in him for the more confirmation of the faith. But confirme thou vs, as thou didſt confirme this thy weake diſciple Thomas, and grant vs ſo perfectlie, and without all doubt to beleeue in thy

Sonne Ieſus Chriſt, that our faith in thy ſight neuer be reproued. Strengthen our frailtie by thy liuelie preſence. Appeare to vs in the night, that humane darkeneſſe doo not extinguiſh the light in vs. Bring thy gifts into houſes ſhut vp, into our poore cottages, which are in great danger, by reaſon of thine enimies. Speake thou vnto vs with thy bleſſed voice, outwardlie by thy word, and inwardlie by thy ſpirit working thy peace within vs, that filled with the ſenſe of thy preſence, we may reſt, coupled through thee in the ſpirit vnto thine eternall Father. Take vs vp being fraile and fallen downe in this life. Shew vs thy woonders, that in the fight of our conſcience with the diſpleaſure of thine eternall Father, we may remember thy merits. Laie vs miſerable and weake ones in thy ſide and wounds, that we may be hid and couered from the wrath of God, and ſucke from thy bodie the water which waſheth all our vncleanneſſe, and the liuelie nouriſhment of thy bloud, which may ſtrengthen vs into euerlaſting life, that we be not vnbeleeuers, but in the number of the faithfull, and from our hart may imitate that noble confeſſion of this thine Apoſtle Saint Thomas, and againſt all the blaſphemous ſpirits, and thine enimies, acknowledge that thou art the Lord, and our God, euen that God, which from the beginning hath beene preſent with his Church, both externallie by his Miniſters, and inwardlie by the ſecret working of his holie ſpirit, which may euermore defend his Church againſt the rage of his enimies, and by a couenant with mankind, knitteth the faithfull to his owne fleſh. Grant O Sonne of God, and mightie Iehoua, that firmelie we may beleeue this thy promiſe, depend vpon thee, hope of thine aid againſt hope, & begin our ſaluation from thy word reuealed, that beleeuing in thee our Sauiour, which art Chriſt our high Prieſt & King, we may find eternall life in thee,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        
                        3. On Saint Steeuens daie; VVho was the first that was martyred, and shed his bloud for Chriſt crucified. They gather themſelues togither againſt the ſoule of the righteous, and condemne the innocent bloud.
                        
                        
                           O Chriſt our Lord and ſauiour, which with greefe of hart didſt bewaile the ingratitude of the Iewiſh nation, which both vnkindlie contemned thy benefits, & killed thy Prophets moſt cruellie; we beſeech thee make vs euermore to haue in mind, and acknowledge the greatneſſe of thy loue towards mankinde.
                        Thou art that naturall hen. Thou begetteſt to thy ſelfe a congregation by the egge, and ſingular ſeed of thy firſt promiſe made in Paradiſe. Thou gathereſt ſuch as beleeue and depend thereon vnder thy wings; by thine interceſſion, againſt the wrath of God, which is a conſuming fire; and by thy liuelie heate thou nonriſheſt them, powring vpon them thy ſpirit, which is a ſubſtantiall fire flowing from the breſt both of thee and thine eternall Father, expelleth the coldneſſe of our nature, and quickneth ſuch as are ingraffed in thee vnto a new life. Thou encountereſt with Kites, rauening birds, raging ſpirits, and all the mortall infernall enimies, for the ſafegard of thy poore chickens. Wherefore keepe vs, we humblie praie thee, among thy chickens, which with a woonderfull and entire affection acknowledge thy voice when thou calleſt, which couer themſelues vnder thy wings, and drawe from thy breſt moſt godlie comfort in their greefe of hart, and ſtrength againſt all enimies.
                        And, O comfortable gheſt of the ſoule, leaue not our houſes deſolate, ceaſe not to fill vs by thy continuall

preſence, with thy life and righteouſneſſe: giue vs the true comfort of mind, that before all worldlie things we may prefer the confeſſion of thy truth, euen as that reuerend old man Zacharie father of Iohn Baptiſt, betweene the temple and the altar with his bloud, as with a pretious burnt ſacrifice, did confeſſe thee to bee the Meſſias ſent frō thine eternall Father. Saue vs from bloud-ſhedding, O Lord our Sauiour, that we wrap not our ſelues in paines moſt intollerable, wherwith thine enimies, which haue defiled themſelues with the innocent bloud of thy martyrs, are oppreſſed.
                        And as thy glorious martyr and truſtie Deacon of thy Church Steeuen, when moſt heinous faults were laid vpon him, as though he had proclaimed defiance both to God and his Church, did continue conſtant in thy faith; vſing a moſt excellent and effectuall forme of praier for his enimies thy perſecutors, conteining the ſumme of true doctrine; ſawe the heauens open, and thee, O Sonne of God, ſtanding on the right hand of thy Father, to whom at the point of death he commended his ſoule: ſo aſſiſt vs with thy grace, that wee by his example may learne both to loue, and praie for our enimies, and that we feare not the peruerſe opinions of the wicked world. Be thou with vs in trouble according to thy promiſe; open to vs the heauens; ſhew vs thy liuelie countenance by thy good preſence; comfort our ſorowfull minds; make it knowne vnto vs, that thine eternall Father is pacified through thee. And finallie, when our ſoules ſhall depart frō our bodies, receiue them, we hartilie beſeech thee, into thine almightie hands. Giue grace, that quietlie we may reſt, and fall aſleepe, till at the reſurrection of mankind, thou bringeſt thy Church and choſen to thy viſible preſence in the heauens, where thou remaineſt, and watching full tenderlie ouer thy flocke, thou placeſt the ſame at the right hand of thy Father,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        
                        4. On Saint Iohn the Euangeliſts daie: Being the Diſciple whom Christ ſo deerlie loued, and who at the reſurrection of Chriſt was 22. yeeres old, and liued in all eightie nine yeeres. With the bread of life and vnderſtanding ſhall the Lord féed him, and giue him the water of wholſowe wiſedome to drinke.
                        
                        
                           O Sonne of God, full ſixtie and ſeuen yeeres did thy beloued diſciple Iohn, among great miſeries, & greeuous combats, ſpread abroad thy Goſpell in Aſia the leſſer, where much idolatrous ſeruice, curioſitie, and Greekiſh lightneſſe was vſed. He reſted himſelfe not onelie corporallie vpon thy boſome or ſhoulders, being conuerſant with thee in the earth, and loued of thee as thy kinſman; but ſpirituallie alſo drue from thy breaſt the ſpirit of wiſdome, repleniſhing his mind and hart with heauenlie light, ſtrength of faith, and celeſtiall vertues. He ſawe the wofull deſtruction of his countrie, and beheld the tragicall ouerthrowe of his nation. He ſawe the decaie of that Common-weale, that was ordeined of God; and of that temple, which in all the world was the onelie temple of God. He encountered with Ebion and Cerynthus, moſt wretched heretikes, which were the trumpets of Sathan to blowe abroad damnable opinions; which as the firſt Cain, by the prouocation of the diuell, did contumeliouſly deale with the Sonne of God, & derided his promiſe. And as afterward the nations by their monſterous multitude of feined gods did reiect Chriſt, and his benefits: ſo in a deſperate boldnes did they ſet themſelues againſt heauen, and blaſphemouſlie detract from the Sonne of God his diuinitie.
                        But thanks be to thee, O Sonne of God, which art the ſubſtantiall image and word of the eternall Father,

thou haſt by the doctrine and authoritie of this thy bleſſed Apoſtle & Euangeliſt S. Iohn, not onlie inlightned thy Church greatlie with the bright beames of thy heauenlie light of diuine knowledge; but alſo by the teſtimonie of thy iudgement, with horrible puniſhment cut off thoſe blaſphemers and heretikes that troubled thy Church, and deliuered the truth of that article vnto vs. O preſerue this light among vs henceforward, that we may attaine thereby to thine euerlaſting gifts, and ſuffer vs not to bee wrapped anie more in idolatrous darkneſſe and ſuperſtition, which is contrarie to thy glorie.
                        Mo enimies alſo, Lord, hath Sathan ſtirred vp to deface this thy truth and glorie, euen the horrible power of the Turks, which with brazen faces, both blaſphemouſlie deale with thee, and perſecute thy Church, confeſſing thy truth: but ſuffer not, O Sonne of God; ſuffer not, we beſeech thee, the true knowledge of thee, by the power of Sathan, and his miniſters, to be blotted out: but keepe for thy ſelfe an holie ſeed among vs, which againſt all the gates of hell may profeſſe thee to be the eternal Sonne of the euerliuing God, to whom the whole ſocietie of Saints with one conſent doth aſcribe all power, all knowledge, all heauenlie vertues, and willeth all praiers and ſupplications to bee directed to thee alone, which art God alone. Maintaine alſo among vs the true ſenſe of the difference betweene humane righteouſneſſe and thine. Grant that willinglie we may obeie thee, leading vs vnto the exerciſes of true repentance, vnto the croſſe, vnto troubles, and vnto death, where our will is truelie bound, and obeieth altogither. Giue grace likewiſe, that we mooue not vnneceſſarie ſtrife, through pride, ambition and curioſitie, as did Samoſatenus, Arrius, and manie mo; but may followe thee, and in our vocation both in teaching, and learning, and liuing, may continue

in the truth of doctrine; that we may be found in that companie, which thou loueſt intirelie, and wilt prouide for, vntill thou returne,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        5. On the holie Innocents daie: VVhich washed their garments in the bloud of the Lambe euen in their infancie, by the crueltie of Herod. The ſoules of the righteous are in the hands of God, and there ſhall no torment touch them.
                        
                        
                           O Sonne of God, in the time of thine humiliation, euen from thy natiuitie and infancie, trulie diddeſt thou taſte the ſtreame of mans miſerie. Poorlie thou waſt borne; naked and deſpiſed in the ſtrawe waſt thou laid, and among the beaſts diddeſt thou ſend foorth thy crie. The ſeed of Dauid had almoſt withered awaie. Thy good mother, that bleſſed virgin Marie, nurſed and nouriſhed thee vp as a ſpring in a drie land, among much troubles; and in thy tender age, what with the tyrannie of Sathan, and the crueltie of Herod, into a farre countrie thou waſt exiled. The good old man Ioſeph, thy foſterfather, and thy bleſſed mother Marie, at the commandement of the Angel aſtoniſhed, through the feare of danger at hand, in the night ſtole awaie with thee, and tooke a long iournie, euen with greefe of hart. An hundred miles trauelled they through the deſolate wilderneſſe, by the craggie and ſolitarie places of Arabia, euen through that nation, which alwaie for theft, robberie, theeuerie, and crueltie, hath been moſt infamous, and at length they brought thee into the prouince of the Emperour of Rome, whom God would ſhould bee thy protectour. The watch of Angels did defend thee

with thy bleſſed mother; they were thy leaders, and companions of thy baniſhment, and draue awaie the cruell theeues alwaies from thee.
                        Hereby haſt thou, O Sonne of God, put vs in mind both of our miſerie, and of thy benefits. For mankind was baniſhed out of paradiſe, from the ſtate of happineſſe and ioie, into the miſeries of this life. Yea, thy Church in this world is in baniſhment, and oppreſſed with men of might. The moſt excellent members of thy Church, moſt commonlie are purſued to the death; but taking compaſſion on our miſeries, of thine owne accord thou becameſt an exile for our ſakes, and an interceſſor for mankind. Thou madeſt thy ſelfe of no reputation, thou tookeſt vpon thee the miſerable maſſe and ſkin of our nature: thou waſt a pilgrime in this world; thou haddeſt not a place to hide thine head in; thou vſurpedſt none authoritie without calling: after a woonderfull maner did the word lurke, thy fleſh ſuffering and dieng, and all to bring vs againe into our natiue countrie indeed, from whence our beginning was, and where our citie is.
                        Wherefore from the bottome of our hart we beſeech thee Sonne of God, inſtill into vs a true loue of that celeſtiall countrie; kindle within vs a true deſire of thy companie; comfort vs in this our baniſhment; and ſend thine holie Angels to protect vs, & to driue awaie the tyrannie of Sathan, and of thine enimies. Finallie, when our ſoules ſhall depart out of this vale of miſeries, place them, we beſeech thee, in the tower of our true countrie. And as thou ſauedſt thy Church, notwithſtanding the raging tyrannie of cruell Herod, when both thou with thy carefull parents tookedſt thy flight into Aegypt; and Iohn the Baptiſt was hid in the deſert beyond Iordan: ſo hence forward defend vs againſt the furie of diuels and men.
                        Oh Lord, from the breſts and imbracements of their

tender mothers, did the cruell and wicked ſeruants of bloudie Herod the tyrant, as this daie, plucke awaie the yoong infants. And ſuch is the outward ſtate of thy Church manie times, that of hir it may be ſaid; Rachel would not be comforted, bicauſe hir children were not left aliue vnſlaine: yet maintaineſt thou for all that, ſome remnant, and caſteſt thine enimies into eternall damnation.
                        Wherefore, as thy praiſe was this daie confeſſed and ſhewed foorth, not in ſpeaking, but in dieng, by the yoong babes, infants and innocents, who waſhed their wounds, and tender ſkins in the bloud of the Lambe, and bare witneſſe of thy comming in the fleſh by their death; the which are exalted into a farre better life, where thou wipeſt all teares from their eies: and at the glorifieng of thy Church, wilt place before all thine elect this ſweet companie in vnſpeakeable glorie; and rebuke to their vtter confuſion the diuell and his inſtruments hired for their wickedneſſe: ſo mortifie and kill all vice in vs, that in our conuerſation, our life may expreſſe thy faith, which with our tongues we doo confeſſe: and keepe vs in the profeſſion of thy truth. Mitigate the troubles of thy Church, that it periſh not altogither, and being deliuered from this ſorowfull baniſhment; ioine vs to the citizens of thy kingdome, which folowe the Lambe whither ſoeuer he goeth, and cheerfullie ſing; Glorie be to God on high:
                        
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        6. On the daie of Saint Paules conuerſion, from a perſecuter, to an Apostle. Their ſound is gone out into all lands, and their words into the ends of the world.
                        
                        
                           WE yeeld thee moſt hartie thanks, O Lord Chriſt, Sonne of the liuing God, for gathering alwaies to thy ſelfe a Church out of mankind, through the voice of the miniſterie,

and eſpeciallie at this time, for ſending thine elect veſſell Paule thine Apoſtle, to ſpread foorth the memoriall of thy benefit among the Gentiles and people, whoſe life at that time was moſt filthie vnder that monſter among men Nero the Emperour. Great was the benefit which came by his preaching, and as great was and is the commoditie which they did in foretime, and we in theſe laſt daies of the world doo reape by his godlie and heauenlie writings. We beſeech thee euen with deepe ſighes, continue oh continue among vs thy light inflamed through the miniſterie of this heroicall Doctor. And grant, that as thou haſt taught all the world, through the preaching of this thy bleſſed Apoſtle; ſo we which haue his woonderfull conuerſion now in remembrance, may followe and fulfill the holie doctrine that he taught. Grant that manie labourers mightilie may be thruſt into thy vineyard, and faithfull obſeruers of the doctrine of Paule, earneſt ſeekers of the aduancement of thy truth, right diuiders of the word of life, learned in ſhewing the difference betweene the Lawe and the Goſpell; wiſe in comforting the troubled conſcience of the wicked, patternes of the faithfull in word and conuerſation; ſuch as may become all in all, to winne manie to the glorieng in afflictions; fearing neither the hatred of men, nor the ingratitude of the world; ſhewing conſtancie vnto the death in the confeſſion of the truth.
                        Bleſſe alſo the hearers of Saint Pauls preaching, that they may prooue the true followers of Paule, fighting a good fight, keeping faith and a good conſcience, caſting off the old man, and putting on the new, euen thee Ieſus Chriſt, being renewed by thy ſpirit, vnto a true light and life, trulie touched with a deſire of thee, trulie coueting to be diſſolued, and to be with thee, that tranſlated out of this darkeneſſe into thy woonderfull light, they may ſee thee face to face, and

knowe the cauſes of ſecret things, which are hid from vs in this life.
                        And foraſmuch as in this world thou wilt haue the beginning of thy wiſedome to be learned, and biddeſt vs to drawe our water from thee the fountaine, grant that heerein alſo manie may imitate the faithfulneſſe and labour of thine Apoſtle: make them as diligent in reading and preaching, ſo in brideling and chaſtiſing their bodies, painefull, and conſtant in thy ſeruice, till they be brought vnto thy ſchoole, where all thy Saints in a cleere and perfect light ſhall behold thee,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        7. On the feaſt daie of the purification of Saint Marie the virgin, and mother of Christ. The word became fleſh, and dwelt among vs: Halleluiah.
                           
                        
                        
                           O Eternall Father of thine onelie Sonne our Lord and Sauiour Chriſt, which in the Common-wealth of Iſraell (ordeined according to thy wiſedome, and adorned with excellent ſtatutes neceſſarie for the ſtate of mankind, and ſignifieng ſecret and heauenlie things) didſt make diuers lawes concerning vncleanneſſe, and the keeping of women with child, and another for the firſt borne; and that not onlie to put vs in mind of order in this life, and thankefulneſſe towards thy miniſterie; but alſo to teach, that this our giltie and polluted nature, like the foule and menſtruous cloath of a woman, is waſhed by the bloud of thy Sonne, which is thy firſt borne, thy ſubſtantiall image, and the word ſounding thy will, whome from the heauens thou commandeſt to be harkened vnto.
                        Gouerne vs by thy firſt and onlie begotten Sonne. Giue vs thy holie ſpirit, that earneſtlie we may bewaile

our vncleanneſſe and polluſion; aſke helpe at thy mercifull hand, be purified by the bloud of thy Sonne, and be redeemed by him vnto true integritie and cleanneſſe, which pleaſeth thee, that for his ſake we may be adopted into thy children, and find fauour in thine eies.
                        And as that good old man father Simeon, notwithſtanding that publikelie little or no talke was vſed of thy benefits, by reaſon of the manifold ſects then ſproong vp, and horrible tyrannie of Gouernours; yet was confirmed by thy holie ſpirit in the truth, and receiued a ſingular promiſe, that he ſhould ſee the Meſſias: ſo by the ſame thy ſpirit kindle in vs faith, whereby we may eſcape the palpable and curſſed darkeneſſe of idolatrie, which in the world welnigh is vſed. And grant that we may apprehend thy Sonne, who as this daie was preſented in the Temple in ſubſtance of our fleſh, and in his armes depart in peace, and be preſented vnto thee with pure and cleane minds. Aſſiſt vs, that from our harts, as did good father Simeon and holie Iacob, we may firmelie keepe him among the feares of conſcience, and pangs of death. Grant that he may be our light, inflaming the darkeneſſe of our feeble minds with the brightneſſe of his glorie. Blot out all our doubtings; heale the diſeaſes of our ſoule; and kindle that benefit and excellent light of true religion, that being made followers in the ſpirituall ſocietie of thy people Iſraell, whoſe glorie is thy Sonne, witneſſing, that among that people the promiſes and reuelations of the eſſence and will of the true God were made, we may alſo come to thy glorie, which our nature needeth, and be adorned by thy Sonne, with the heauenlie bleſſing of the forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes, and receiuing righteouſneſſe and eternall life,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        
                        8. On Saint Matthias daie. Thou haſt exalted one choſen out of the people, to publiſh thy lawe: bleſſed be thy name, O Lord.
                        
                        
                           ALmightie God, and moſt mercifull heauenlie Father, who (becauſe the Scripture muſt needs haue beene fulfilled, which the holie Ghoſt, through the mouth of Dauid, ſpake before of the Traitor Iudas, who was guide to the Iewes that tooke Ieſus thy deere Sonne our Lord, and who now in reward of his iniquitie, for betraieng thine innocent Sonne his Lord and Maiſter, went & hoong himſelfe in the feeld of bloud called Acheldama, till he burſt aſunder in the midſt, and all his guts and bowels guſhed out) didſt afterward, at the earneſt praiers and petition of the reſt of thy diſciples, chooſe thy faithfull ſeruant Matthias out of all the companie that followed thee, or had their conuerſation with thine Apoſtles, to be of the number of thy twelue Apoſtles, and ordeinedſt him to be a witneſſe with them of thy Sonnes reſurrection, as it is written in the 109. Pſalme, Let his habitation be void, and no man be dwelling therein, and his Biſhoprike or charge let another take: grant we beſeech thee, that thy Church being alwaie preſerued from hirelings, traitors, and falſe Apoſtles, may be ordered and guided by godlie, faithfull, and true paſtors and miniſters.
                        O Chriſt Sonne of God, greatlie didſt thou reioice at the gathering of the Church; and high thanks didſt thou yeeld to thy Father, becauſe he had choſen an holie ſeed out of mankind, and ſuffered not their pains to be altogither fruſtrate. We thanke thee alſo from our harts, for reioicing at our well-doing, and for repreſſing the diuell by thy power, that ſome may be ſaued.

Gather heereafter, we beſeech thee, from among vs a righteous people pleaſing thee. And although miſerable and ouglie be the outward ſhew of thy Church, and they which ſeeme to be the light of the world, deſpiſe thy wiſedome; euen as neither Tiberius the Emperour, with the Senate of Rome, neither the Princes and Prieſts of the Iews would vouchſafe to heare thee wandering with thy Diſciples & Chriſtian auditorie: yet aſſiſt vs, that theſe ſiniſter iudgements of the world doo not diſmaie vs, but that we may bring our minds into a godlie captiuitie, acknowledge thee by a true and liuelie faith, to be the Sonne of thine eternall Father, & receiue the words from thee, which from the boſome of thy Father vttereſt the counſell concerning the reſtitution of man, to whom all things both in heauen and earth are giuen for vs, which are thy parteners.
                        Leade vs by thine hand, by thy word and ſpirit, before the preſence of thy Father: ſhew vs in a new light inwardlie in our ſoules the preſence of thy Father, which is pleaſed with vs for thy ſake. Abide thou among vs. Powre on vs by thy ſpirit the beginning of that light and righteouſnes, which appeareth in thee, being the light of light, lightning the darkenes of our nature.
                        Behold O good Samaritane, and Phyſician of our ſoules, to thee doo we lift vp our hands: we are wounded: we labour and are heauie laden: thine enimie hath ſpoiled vs, and wounded vs to the death. We are ſo burthened with the weight and greeuouſnes of ſickneſſe, that our ſoule is comfortleſſe, readie to faint and fall into death and damnation. Wherfore comfort our miſerable ſoule with thy ioifull wine and oile, with thine heauenlie and quickening balme raiſe vs from death: vtter thy comfort to our harts, and grant that our ſoules may find reſt and gladneſſe in thee.
                        
                           
Put on vs thy ſweet yoke: tame our fleſh by thy ſpirit. Raiſe vp in vs new motions, and holie cogitations agreeable to thy will and word. Thou art meeke in deed, not deſirous of reuengement. Thou haſt not throwne miſerable man into euerlaſting damnation, as thou didſt the diuels, but haſt ſuffered puniſhment for vs in thy bodie, and praied for thine enimies. Thou art meeke and lowlie in hart. Thou flangeſt thy ſelfe vnder all angels and men; thou tookeſt our fraile and fowle fleſh vpon thee; thou ſhe wedſt not the power of thy diuinitie in the time of thy paſſion, but hidſt (if it might be) thy diuinitie, after a woonderfull & vnſpeakable maner, that thy humane nature might ſuffer and die. Quench alſo in vs by thy ſpirit mercileſſe fires of hatred, and deſire of reuenge (which as worldlie men doo ſaie, is ſweeter than life it ſelfe) with all the flames of pride. Grant that acknowledging our filthines proſtrate before thy face in true lowlineſſe, we may aſke thine helpe, & being healed, may perſeuere in the imitating of thy perfect example. Aſſiſt vs, that while we liue in euerie trouble and temptation of ours, we may drawe the water of comfort from thee, which art the well of life, and afterward enioie perfect eaſe, and a ioifull ſabboth, and feaſtfull holidaies in the heauens, at ſuch time as thou wilt ſhew thy Father to thine elect, where each ſhall behold the other face to face,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        9. On the feaſt daie of the annuntiation of the bleſſed virgin Marie. Shew vs thy mercie, O Lord, and grant vs thy ſaluation.
                        
                        
                           BY thy wiſedome, O eternall God, are the times diſtinguiſhed, whereby we are certified of thy benefits, and euerlaſting bliſſe, which after this life, and deſtruction of the world, is prepared for thine elect. Now are

there paſſed 5543 yeeres, ſith the creation of heauen and earth, of thine Angels, & of all creatures. By thy word thou madeſt man out of the ſlime of the earth; thou breathedſt on him the breth of life, and inſpiredſt into him a ſoule adorned with perfect wiſedome and righteouſneſſe.
                        Afterward thy Sonne did vtter a ſecret decree about the reſtoring of man, fallen through ſinne out of thy fauour into euerlaſting death. About the ſame time of the yeere was innocent Abel murdered, which was a figure of the ſacrifice to come, whoſe bloud indeed crieth vnto thee Father in heauen, and beggeth the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes to all beleeuers. In the like time was Iſaac carried to be offered: and thou commandedſt the people of Iſraell to keepe holie theſe daies, in which thou wouldeſt haue thy benefits to bee ſpoken of. Likewiſe on this ſolemne and ioifull daie of the Equinoctiall ſpring time, which ſithence is 1582 yeeres, thy Sonne, as the Angel Gabriel ſignified to Marie the virgin, by the working of the holie Ghoſt, coupled the humane nature to himſelfe, after a woonderfull and vnſpeakable maner. The ſame daie 1549 yeeres ſithence, thy Sonne, redeemer of mankind, in his weake and bloudie fleſh hoong vpon the Croſſe, being the true Silo. And when the ſunne going betweene Orion and the Pleiades leeſeth his light, he left his life through intollerable ſorowe and torments. And an old ſaieng it hath beene, that about this time of the yeere, our Lord and Sauiour Chriſt will returne in the clouds, both to vanquiſh his enimies, and to exalt his Church and choſen moſt gratiouſlie vnto a new and eternall kingdome.
                        O Sonne of God, ſtir vs vp vnto the conſideration of thoſe ſo excellent myſteries, and worke thou ſo in our harts by thy grace, that as we haue knowne thy holie incarnation by the meſſage of an Angel, ſo by thy

croſſe and paſſion, we may be brought vnto the glorie of thy reſurrection. Through the protection and watch of thine Angel, the holie families of chaſte virgins and matrons remained ſafe and vnſpotted among infinite dangers: by thy ſpirit the truth was ſealed in them, that they could not be ſubdued by the errours of the Phariſies and Saduces. Preſerue likewiſe in this laſt age of the world, ſome holie aſſemblies, and ſuffer not the whole world, before thy cōming againe, to become blaſphemers. This ſhall be the wiſedome of eternall life, in which thou wilt open the cauſes why thou wouldeſt after this maner reſtore mankind, and how God the word could couple our fleſh to himſelfe.
                        Aſſiſt vs, that in this life we may learne the elements, and in true faith be ioined through the holie ſpirit to thy bodie, which thou tookeſt from the ſanctified bodie of the ſacred virgin. And as thou carieſt, and liueſt in the ſame fleſh; ſo make vs branches of the tree of life, and fruitfull vine, and repleniſh vs with like light, life, and glorie. Be thou our Sauiour through thy merit and vertue. Thine eternall Father hath placed thee in the throne of Dauid, that thou maiſt be the head of the Church, working all in all; and the giuer of all good things, and of the bleſſings promiſed to Dauid. Thou reigneſt in this life by thy miniſterie, gathering to thy ſelfe an eternall Church, and repreſſing thine enimies by thy mightie power. Thou ſitteſt exalted in light, and incomprehenſible glorie at the right hand of thy Father, making alwaies interceſſion for vs, vntill thou bring thy Church vnto thy ſelfe in glorie at the generail reſurrection, and ſhine in them viſiblie, and for euer.
                        O Sonne of God, we are bone of thy bones, and fleſh of thy fleſh. Thou broughteſt not thy fleſh from heauen, neither was the ſame borne of the ſubſtance of thy Father; but truelie thou tookeſt thy fleſh from the

ſeed of Abraham, out of the ſanctified wombe of the holie and bleſſed virgin S. Marie. This nature did the word couple to himſelfe by an eternall couenant, and adorneth the ſame with ſurpaſſing glorie, which thou ſhe wedſt not in the time of thine humiliation. Therefore in truth did bleſſed Marie beare God, euen that perſon, in which two natures, that is to ſaie, the word and fleſh were vnited togither, and that without anie confuſion; euen as the ſoule and bodie are coupled in vs men.
                        Wherefore we come vnto thee our Mediator, God and man; and reſpecting thy promiſe in a liuelie faith, we beſeech thee haue mercie vpon vs; waſh vs with thy bloud, and make vs members of thy bodie and nature. No man at anie time hath hated his owne fleſh: make vs to ſticke vnto thee by the ſame ſpirit, and to drawe from thee the iuice, which may ſtrengthen vs to eternall life,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        10. On Saint Marks daie. Thou haſt made them princes in all lands, therefore ſhall they remember thy name, O Lord, from one generation to another.
                        
                        
                           O Eternall, omnipotent, and euerliuing God, Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, which togither with the Sonne and the holie Ghoſt, haſt not onelie created the whole frame of this world, with all things therein conteined; but alſo appointed thy Sonne the word, to be a Mediator for vs men, and for our ſaluation: we beſeech thee, moſt humblie from the bottome of our harts, thou which art the good huſbandman, ingraffe vs in thy Sonne, which is the true vine: make vs branches of his bodie; purge vs from the horrible corruption of our nature; giue vs grace to continue in the vine, that being

deliuered from ſinne, we may bring foorth abundance of fruit to thy honour and glorie.
                        O Chriſt, thou art the vine, we are the branches, through thy grace, not of our owne goodneſſe; gratiouſlie behold vs, we beſeech thee, that euermore we may cleaue to thee. For (alas) without thee, what can we doo that good is? Abide thou in vs, that we may abide in thee; giue vs of thy vertue; let thy light ſhine in our harts, to the extinguiſhing of the fowle darkneſſe of our filthie fleſh: and quicken vs to the bringing out of that fruit, which both may pleaſe thee, and profit thy Church: ſo ſhall we eſcape the vnquenchable fire, into which they which depart from thee are caſt, and be ſure to obtaine whatſoeuer we ſhall aſke at thy mercifull hands in true faith and feare. For thy Father is glorified through our willingneſſe, which is alſo his gift to obeie him. Furthermore, as thou haſt inſtructed thy holie Church with the heauenlie doctrine of thine Euangeliſt S. Marke: giue vs grace likewiſe, that we be not, like children, caried awaie with euerie blaſt of vaine doctrine; but firmelie to be eſtabliſhed in the truth of thy holie Goſpell.
                        And thou holie Ghoſt, come thou inceſſantlie into our harts: firſt to inſtruct our minds with thine heauenlie and eternall will, and being inſtructed, confirme vs in the feare of thy Maieſtie, that at no time we depart from the path of thy commandements. For our continuance in the race of the commandements of God, is a ſpeciall argument, that we loue God vnfeinedlie, whom we ſee not. And ſecondlie, that we may find ioie and comfort in all our troubles, croſſes, and perſecutions whatſoeuer; that in this life we may alwaies abide among the companie of the regenerate, and in the other be made partakers of eternall happineſſe ordeined for the elect, before the beginning of the world,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        
                        11. On Saint Philip and Iames daie. The heauens declare the glorie of God; and the firmament ſheweth his handie worke.
                        
                        
                           O Sonne of GOD, whom truelie to knowe is euerlaſting life, and without whom no man commeth vnto the Father: grant vs perfectlie to knowe thee to be (as thou haſt ſaid of thy ſelfe) the waie, the truth, and the life, as thou haſt taught Saint Philip, & other the Apoſtles. Bring vs wandering trauellers into the waie of ſaluation; ſhew vnto vs thy truth; quicken vs by thy ſpirit; lead vs to thy Father, that by thee, and thine humane fleſh now exalted and glorified, the light and life of thine heauenlie Father may be ſpred in vs. Make vs, miſerable exiles, citizens of thine euerlaſting kingdome; prepare vs places & manſions, where we may drawe from thee, which art the true vine of eternall life, in the houſe and table of thy Father, the new iuice of heauenlie comfort, and may continuallie be there, where thou art; that trulie thine eternall Father may be glorified in vs,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        12. On Saint Barnabas daie. Praiſe the Lord, O my ſoule, and forget not all his benefits.
                        
                        
                           O Chriſt, Sonne of GOD, which art perfect charitie, louing vs to the end, and ſufferedſt vpon the altar of the Croſſe a moſt ſhamefull death for our ſakes, to deliuer vs from death and damnation, and to allure vs by that thine example vnto mutuall amitie and good-will: we beſeech

thee, inflame our cold harts with the burning affections of hartie loue. And as thou haſt indued thine holie Apoſtle Barnabas with ſingular gifts of the holie Ghoſt: ſo let vs not be deſtitute of thy manifold gifts, nor yet of grace to vſe them alwaie to thine honour and glorie, as he did. Giue vs grace, I ſaie, firſt aboue all things to loue thee the true and onelie God, with the Father and the holie Ghoſt, with all our harts, with all our ſoule, and with all our ſtrength, that continuallie we may cleaue vnto thee with full purpoſe of hart, as this thine holie Apoſtle exhorteth. Raiſe vp ſecondlie a deſire of brotherlie good-will towards our neighbours; that we may helpe one another, and as members of one bodie, haue a mutuall compaſſion ech of other, ſo that we may loue among our ſelues vnfeinedlie, and abound in mutuall good-will, that our harts may be vnblameable in holineſſe before God.
                        Inflame our breaſts, that by thine example we may loue euen our verie enimies, and bleſſe them, which curſe vs; doo good to them, which hate and hurt vs, leauing reuengement alwaies vnto thee. For he, which loueth not his brother, knoweth not God; but abideth in death, and dooeth vainelie boaſt againſt the truth. Wherefore, let not the Sunne go downe vpon our wrath; but make vs quiet, putting on tender mercie, kindneſſe, humbleneſſe of mind, meekneſſe, and aboue all, charitie, which is the bond of perfection; the end of the cōmandements, and fulfilling of the lawe: ſo that by loue our faith may be fruitfull, and we at no time ſeuered from thee. For thou art loue, and he that dwelleth in loue, dwelleth in God, and God in him: ſo that we ſhall be no more ſeruants, but friends, in dooing the will of the heauenlie Father, through the gratious good-will of thee his onelie begotten Sonne our Sauiour, which haſt choſen vs to bring foorth fruit,

whereby we ſhall ſo pleaſe his and thy ſacred Maieſtie, that we ſhall be ſure to obteine whatſoeuer we aſke at his hands through faith in thy name,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        13. On Saint Iohn Baptiſts daie. I giue mine owne ſelfe the blame, and take repentance in duſt and aſhes.
                        
                        
                           O Eternall Father of our Lord Ieſu Chriſt, wee yeeld thee moſt hartie thanks for gathering to thy ſelfe, for and through thy Sonne, an holie companie, praiſing and celebrating thy goodneſſe for euermore. Alſo for ſending from time to time teachers adorned with excellent gifts and warrants from heauen, to ſpread foorth and publiſh the truth to mankinde, among whome, we knowe right well, that the famous fore-runnner of thy Sonne, euen the holie and reuerent Saint Iohn the Baptiſt excelled. He by thy prouidence was woonderfullie borne, and ſent to prepare the way of thy Sonne our Sauiour, by preaching repentance. He was the firſt publiſher of the new Teſtament; the firſt purger of the Goſpell from the groſſe errours of the ſuperſtitious Phariſes; the ſpreader abroade of the articles of our faith, and the imprinter of Ieſus Chriſt the Sonne of God in the harts of men.
                        We humblie beſeech thee, gather from among vs an eternall Church. Teach our harts by thine heauenlie ſpirit, that vnfeignedlie we may liſten to, and loue the doctrine which Iohn ſoundeth to the world. Make vs ſo to followe his doctrine and holie life, I ſaie, that we may trulie repent according to his preaching, and after his example conſtantlie ſpeake the truth, boldlie rebuke vice, and patientlie ſuffer for the truth ſake, as

he did, that being ingraffed into thy flocke, we may become his diſciples, and bring foorth fruit woorthie repentance, and behold the diuinitie which he ſawe; ſo ſhall we be deliuered from the wrath of God, and admitted into the fellowſhip of eternall life,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        14. On Saint Peters daie. Their ſpéech is gone out into all lands, and their words into the ends of the world.
                        
                        
                           O Lord Ieſu Chriſt, Sonne of God, which art the word of the eternall Father, and the Embaſſador ſent frō the beginning vnto thy Church, ſpeake thou inwardlie to our harts thine heauenlie wiſedome: lighten our nature & vnderſtanding with thy newe light, that being demanded in euerie anguiſh, we may trulie acknowledge and confeſſe that thou art the Sonne of the liuing God our King and Sauiour. And for aſmuch as great is the rage, and mightie the power of thine enimies, which fight againſt the truth, mercifullie defend thy Church, ſounding foorth this thy wiſedome, defend the ſame we beſeech thee againſt the verie gates of hell.
                        And as thou haſt giuen to the Apoſtle Saint Peter manie excellent gifts, and commandedſt him earneſtlie to feed the flocke, wherby at the infancie as it were of thy Church, he was a glorious light of the Goſpell, and publiſher of the truth: ſo keepe among vs thy miniſterie, and ſend godlie preachers, which may godlie and rightlie vſe the keies in comforting and correcting. Make, we beſeech thee, all Biſhops and paſtors diligentlie to preach thy holie word, and the people obedientlie to followe the ſame, that in this life we may be, and abide citizens of the bleſſed fellowſhip,

which thou dooeſt protect, and receiue the crowne of euerlaſting glorie, as heires of thine eternall kingdome,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        15. On Saint Iames the Apoſtles daie. When my father and my mother forſake me, thou, O Lord, takeſt me vp: therefore I made haſte, and prolonged not the time to kéepe thy commandements.
                        
                        
                           O Sonne of God, Lord and Sauiour Chriſt, which cameſt into this world to giue thy life for manie, ſtirre vp our hearts vnto the true cogitation of thy benefits and obedience, which was a ſufficient ranſome for the ſinnes of all mankinde, pacifieng the wrath of God, and giuing euerlaſting life to as manie as approch vnto thee in true faith. We beſech thee, forſomuch as in vs doth, as in thy diſciples did, ſticke great vncleanneſſe; heale our minds by thy ſpirit. Quench in vs our vaine deſires of ſuperioritie, which maruellouſlie doo boile within the harts of men. Grant that the miniſters may knowe rightlie the difference betweene ciuill policie and religion, that they caſt not vnto thee in mockerie, purple; neither pricke thine head with a crowne of thornes: but may ſerue thy Church in humilitie, as faithfull diſpenſators of thy myſteries, folowing thine example, in whome perfect humilitie appeared, when thou flangeſt thy ſelfe downe vnder Angels & men. Aſſiſt vs alſo, that we may drinke of thy cup, & be baptiſed with thy Baptiſme in true calling vpon thee, and perfect patience in all our aduerſities. And grant, that as thine holie Apoſtle Iames, leauing his father and all that he had without delaie, was obedient vnto thy calling, and moſt willinglie followed thee: ſo we forſaking

all worldlie and carnall affections, may be euermore readie to followe thy commandements, till thou drawe vs vp vnto the ſight of thy viſible kingdome, which is ye right hand of thine eternall Father,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        16. On Saint Bartholomew the Apoſtles daie. I beleeued, and therefore will I ſpeake, that I may walke before the Lord in the land of the liuing.
                        
                        
                           O Chriſt Sonne of God, great was the weakeneſſe and ſluggiſhneſſe of thy diſciples, both in thy laſt ſupper when they contended about ſuperioritie, and worldlie gouernement, & in thine agonie, when they ſlept: and as great is the wickednes and ſecuritie of this laſt age, which making warre for wealth, vnder the cloake of fauoring the Goſpell, ſeeketh after honor and promotion, ſleepeth ſoundlie, and is nothing moued with the blaſphemous idolatrie, wherein the whole world is wrapped, to thy great diſhonor: yea the greeuous puniſhments which thou ſendeſt euerie-where, doo nothing terrifie them from their ſinne. But, O Sonne of God, breake our deadlie ſleepe; teach the hearts of our miniſters, that they muſt not be ambitious, neither ſtriue about excellencie, nor tranſforme the Goſpell into ciuill policie: but aſſiſt vs, that we may all thinke of thy commandement, which is, Learne of me, for I am meeke and lowlie in heart. Powre vpon vs ſuch vertues as thou haſt in thy ſelfe moſt aboundantlie. Thou deſtroiedſt not mankinde, which had offended thee, but flangeſt thy ſelfe vnder all Angels and men, and tookeſt this miſerable fleſh of ours vpon thee, & that to ſaue, and ſerue vs trulie in great humilitie.
                        Thou, O Sonne of God, which haſt giuen grace to

thine Apoſtle Bartholomew, trulie to beleeue, and to preach thy word, grant wee beſeech thee vnto thy Church, both to loue that he beleeued, and to preach that he taught. And as thou ſitteſt for euer at the table of the Father, in which all heauenlie wiſedome doth abound; ſo place vs miſerable ones in the loweſt ſeates of that thy table, where thine Apoſtles and teachers, which haue inſtructed manie vnto righteouſneſſe, doo ſhine as the lights of the Church, and differ in woonderfull glorie from other inferiour members: albeit, it ſufficeth vs, ſo we gather crooms from thy table, which filleth ſuch as eate and digeſt them with euerlaſting ioie,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        17. On Saint Matthewes daie. Incline my hart vnto thy teſtimonies, and not to couetouſneſſe.
                        
                        
                           IT was thy ſaieng O Chriſt Sonne of God, that the ſicke need the Phyſician: wherefore we humblie beſeech thee, heale vs miſerable folkes with thine heauenlie Phyſicke. Be mercifull vnto vs ſinners, and feed vs with the deintie diſhes of thy ſpirituall comfort. Haue mercie on the Church, whoſe whole bodie is greeuouſlie afflicted through manifold diſeaſes and euils. The teachers ſit as doo the merchants for gaine: they tranſforme the Goſpell into an outward pompe, and bait for preferment. Wherefore keepe thou ſome ſound part, which may vnfeignedlie acknowledge thee to be the onlie and beſt Phyſician, which haſt deliuered vs from the curſſe of the lawe, and reſtored vs to life and righteouſneſſe. And grant O bleſſed Sonne of God, that as thou didſt call Matthew from the receipt of cuſtome to be an Apoſtle and Euangeliſt; ſo giue vs grace to forſake all

couetous deſires, and inordinate care of riches, and to followe thee in all things thou haſt commanded.
                        Furthermore, thou O Chriſt haſt taught, that the church of the new teſtament is not tied vnto the Moſaicall gouernement, neither vnto the ceremonies and traditions of man, & haſt reprooued alſo the Phariſaicall error, which in all ages hath ſhamefullie obſcured the light of thy Goſpell, that ceremonies are to be preferred before the works of the morall lawe. Continue this light among vs. Grant that we may woorſhip thee, not in the works and precepts of men, but in obſeruation of thy commandements, and woorſhipping thee in ſpirit and truth. Worke, O worke within vs an obedience anſwering to thy lawes in both tables, that retaining faith and a good conſcience, we may ſit with thee for euermore in thy celeſtiall kingdome after our reſurrection,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        18. On Saint Michaels daie, and all Angels. O praiſe the Lord yée Angels of his, yée that excell in ſtrength, and fulfill his commandement.
                        
                        
                           O Almightie, euerlaſting, and euerliuing God, which before all times didſt beget a Sonne in thine owne image, in whome ſhineth the heauenlie light, which no creature can apprehend, as it is in deede, albeit ſome taſte and ſparke thereof thou beſtoweſt vpon men, by lightening them by thy Sonne to vnfeigned repentance, & ſorowe for their ſinne. Thou commandedſt that light ſhould be made, and ſo not onlie bodies ſhining with noble light yet vnreaſonable were made, but beſides alſo other ſpirituall natures, as Angels, were brought foorth, into which thou powredſt the beames of thy light, of thy

wiſedome, of thy righteouſneſſe and life, and appointedſt a companie of them, which remained in their innocencie to euerlaſting righteouſnes and life, that alwaies they might behold the countenance of the eternall Father, being repleniſhed with perfect goodneſſe.
                        Thou haſt ordeined and conſtituted in a woonderfull order, that moſt excellent nature of all Angels, to ſerue thy Church, to defend the weake and feeble companie of men, which in this life turne vnto thy Sonne our verie Michael. Thou commandeſt thoſe heroicall and valiant ſpirits, to protect thy Church, kingdoms, and godlie ſchooles, and places where thy Church doth abide, calling vpon thee in feare, and continuing in thy ſeruice. We thanke thee from our harts for this great and vnſpeakable benefit; beſeeching thee moſt humblie mercifullie to grant, that they which alwaie doo thee ſeruice in heauen, may by thine appointment ſuccour and defend vs here in earth.
                        Conuert vs, O Lord, and we ſhall be conuerted, teach vs to confeſſe this thy goodneſſe, and following the example of thine holie Angels, to ſerue thee and thy congregation in true and ſincere humilitie. Compaſſe our Churches, Common-weales, and houſes, with the watch of thine Angels: driue awaie from vs and our houſes, diuels thine enimies, lieng, blaſphemous, cruell, murdering, and inceſtuous ſpirits, which through extreme hatred of thee and thy Sonne, torment man, labouring to bring it about, that all fleſh may blaſpheme thee. Repreſſe the rage of them in their members, in falſe teachers, in the enimies of thy truth, in Turks, and other tyrants, which perſecute vs. Helpe vs in this world, being ingraffed into that Church, which thou dooeſt protect, and may continue faithfull vnto the death, and afterward being tranſlated into eternall life be like the Angels, yeelding immortall thanks vnto thee for thine infinite benefits,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        
                        19. On Saint Luke the Euangeliſts daie. It is neither herbe nor emplaſter that reſtoreth vs to health; but thy word, O Lord, which healeth all things.
                        
                        
                           O Omnipotent, almightie, and euerliuing God, which calledſt Luke the Phyſician, whoſe praiſe is in the Goſpell, to be a Phyſician of the ſoule; it may pleaſe thee by the wholſome medicine of his doctrine, to heale all the diſeaſes of our ſoules. And as by thy Sonne our Lord and Sauiour Chriſt, thou haſt commanded vs to praie, that labourers may be thruſt into thy harueſt: ſo grant vnto vs, for the ſame thy ſonne, Biſhops of thine owne inſtructing, good ſhepherds, ſound preachers, faithfull workmen, and godlie miniſters, which may faithfullie ouerſee, and by thy word of ſaluation proſperouſlie gouerne thy Church, being deerlie bought with the pretious bloud of thine onelie Sonne. Giue vnto vs ſuch teachers, as are both learned in thy word, and commended for their good liuing: direct them being illuminated with thine heauenlie light, that they may rightlie deliuer, and diuide vnto vs the principles of good doctrine, the word of truth, and the Goſpell of life, and open the difference betweene the lawe and the Goſpell: teach vs to beware of the leauen of the Phariſies, and the contagious doctrine of mans traditions; informe vs in all ſpirituall wiſedome, and bring vs by the operation of thine holie ſpirit vnto perfection, both in the eies of God, and ſight of the world. Grant that their labours may take good ſucceſſe, to the increaſe of thy celeſtiall harueſt. Giue them grace to continue conſtant in their profeſſion, fearing neither the hatred, nor ingratitude of this world, beleeuing certainlie that ſuch as deſpiſe them, are deſpiſed of

thee, and that thou neither wilt of thine holineſſe, nor wilt of thy iuſtice ſuffer ſuch blaſpemous impietie to go vnpuniſhed,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        20. On Simon and Iudes daie Apoſtles. Thou haſt made them princes in all lands: therefore ſhall they remember thy name, O Lord, from one generation to another.
                        
                        
                           ALmightie God, which haſt builded thy congregation vpon the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Ieſu Chriſt himſelfe being the head corner ſtone: grant vs ſo to be ioined togither in vnitie of ſpirit by their doctrine, that we may be made an holie temple acceptable to thee. And, O Lord Ieſu Chriſt, which after this maner diddeſt comfort thine Apoſtles, whom the world would hate and abhorre, ſaieng; I haue choſen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. Separate vs, we humblie beſeech thee, from the darkneſſe, idolatrie, and wickedneſſe of this world, and ioine vs to that companie, among which thy Godhead dooeth dwell. Grant that in true loue we may be ioined vnto thine eternall Father, through thy ſpirit, which is the bond of peace. Make vs nothing to dread the ſiniſter iudgements of the world, neither yet for anie perils to forſake thy truth: but patientlie ſuffer the iniuries, from which thy ſelfe waſt not free.

                           WE thanke thee, O almightie God our heauenlie Father, for that of thine infinite mercie, through our Lord and Sauiour, and working

of thine holie ſpirit, thou gathereſt out of mankind an euerlaſting Church, & haſt knit togither thine elect in one communion and felowſhip in the myſticall bodie of the ſame thy Sonne Chriſt our Lord, & defendeſt the ſame mightilie againſt the rage of the diuels, and tyrannie of his members: yea, and haſt promiſed one daie by thy Sonne to raiſe the ſame from death, and to adorne it with vnſpeakable glorie. We beſeech thee haue mercie on vs, for the ſake of the ſame thy Sonne our Mediator and Sauiour; and grant vs grace ſo to followe thy holie Saints in all vertue and godlie liuing, that we may come to thoſe vnſpeakable ioies, which thou haſt prepared for them that vnfeinedlie loue thee. And gather from among vs euermore ſome religious companie, which may ſerue thee in faith, and a good conſcience. Aſſiſt, that in this life, that benefit of eternall life may begin, that we may in a contrite hart obeie thee, patientlie ſuffer the troubles, which accompanie thy Goſpell, ſhew our ſelues meeke, and mercifull, hungring and thirſting from our hart after thy righteouſneſſe, and ſeeking for the food of our ſoule aboue all things. Make our ioie perfect, and reioice in deed, looking through faith vpon that bleſſed companie of Angels and men, which enioie thy viſible preſence, among whom thy Sonne is, whom they ſee face to face: and filled with vnſpeakable delight, here diſcourſing of thy woonderfull wiſedome, both in gathering and preſeruing thy Church; bring vs, gratious Lord, vnto the bleſſed cōpanie of thy Saints in this world, and afterward make vs citizens of thine eternall kingdome, togither with all thine Angels and men. O Lord, bleſſed are they, which dwell in thine houſe, foreuer & euer they will praiſe thee,

                           O Lord, rebuke me not in thine indignation: neither chaſten me in thy diſpleaſure.
                        Haue mercie vpon me, O Lord, for I am weake: O Lord heale me. For my bones are vexed.
                        My ſoule is alſo ſore troubled: but Lord, how long wilt thou puniſh me?
                        Turne thee, O Lord, and deliuer my ſoule: Oh ſaue me, for thy mercies ſake.
                        
                           
For in death no man remembreth thee: and who will giue thee thanks in the pit?
                        I am wearie of my groning, euerie night waſh I my bed: and water my couch with my teares.
                        My beautie is gone for verie trouble: and worne awaie bicauſe of all mine enimies.
                        Awaie from me all ye that worke vanitie: for the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping.
                        The Lord hath heard my petition: the Lord will receiue my praier.
                        All mine enimies ſhall be confounded, and ſore vexed: they ſhall be turned backe, and put to ſhame ſuddenlie.

                        Bleſſed is the man vnto whom the Lord imputeth no ſinne: and in whoſe ſpirit there is no guile.
                        For while I held my tongue: my bones conſumed awaie through my dailie complaining.
                        For thy hand is heauie vpon me daie and night: and my moiſture is like the drought in ſummer.
                        I will knowledge my ſinne vnto thee: and mine vnrighteouſneſſe haue I not hid.
                        I ſaid, I will confeſſe my ſinnes vnto the Lord: and ſo thou forgaueſt the wickedneſſe of my ſinne.
                        For this ſhall euerie one that is godlie make his praier vnto thee, in a time when thou maieſt be found: but in the great water-fluds they ſhall not come nigh him.
                        Thou art a place to hide me in; thou ſhalt preſerue me from trouble: thou ſhalt compaſſe me about with ſons of deliuerance.
                        I will informe thee, & teach thee in the waie wherein thou ſhalt go: and I will guide thee with mine eie.

                           PUt me not to rebuke O Lord in thine anger: neither chaſten me in thy heauie diſpleaſure.
                        For thine arrowes ſticke faſt in me: and thy hand preſſeth me ſore.
                        There is no health in my fleſh becauſe of thy diſpleaſure: neither is there anie reſt in my bones by reaſon of my ſinne.
                        For my wickedneſſes are gone ouer my head: and are like a ſore burthen too heauie for me to beare.
                        My wounds ſtinke and are corrupt: through my fooliſhneſſe.
                        I am brought into ſo great trouble and miſerie: that I go moorning all the daie long.
                        For my loines are filled with a ſore diſeaſe: and there is no whole part in my bodie.
                        I am feeble and ſore ſmitten: I haue roared for the verie diſquietneſſe of my hart.
                        Lord, thou knoweſt all my deſire: and my groaning is not hid from thee.
                        My hart panteth, my ſtrength hath failed me: and the ſight of mine eies is gone from me.
                        My louers and my neighbours did ſtand looking vpon my trouble: and my kinſmen ſtood a far off.
                        They alſo that ſought after my life, laid ſnares for me: and they that went about to doo me euill, talked of wickedneſſe, and imagined deceipt all the daie long.
                        
                           
As for me, I was like a deafe man and heard not: and as one that is dumbe, which dooth not open his mouth.
                        I became euen as a man that heareth not: and in whoſe mouth are no reproofes.
                        For in thee, O Lord, haue I put my truſt: thou ſhalt anſwere for me, O Lord my God.
                        I haue required that they (euen mine enimies) ſhould not triumph ouer me: for when my foote ſlipt, they reioiced greatlie ouer me.
                        And I trulie am ſet in the plague: and my heauineſſe is euer in my ſight.
                        For I will confeſſe my wickedneſſe: and be ſorie for my ſinne.
                        But mine enimies liue, and are mightie: and they that hate me wrongfullie, are manie in number.
                        They alſo that reward euill for good, are againſt me: becauſe I followe the thing that good is.
                        Forſake me not, O Lord my God: be not thou far from me.
                        Haſte thee to helpe me O Lord God my ſaluation.

                           HAue mercie vpon me, O God, after thy great goodneſſe: according vnto the multitude of thy mercies doo awaie mine offences.
                        Waſh me throughlie from my wickedneſſe: and cleanſe me from my ſinne.
                        For I knowledge my faults: and my ſinne is euer before me.
                        Againſt thee onlie haue I ſinned, and done this euill in thy ſight: that thou mighteſt be iuſtified in thy ſaiengs, and cleare when thou art iudged.
                        Behold, I was ſhapen in wickedneſſe: and in ſinne hath my mother conceiued me.
                        But lo, thou requireſt truth in the inward parts:

and ſhalt make me to vnderſtand wiſedome ſecretlie.
                        Thou ſhalt purge me with hyſope, and I ſhall bee cleane: thou ſhalt waſh me, and I ſhall be whiter than ſnowe.
                        Thou ſhalt make me heare of ioie and gladneſſe: that the bones which thou haſt broken may reioice.
                        Turne thy face from my ſinnes: and put out all my miſdeeds.
                        Make me a cleane hart, O God: and renew a right ſpirit within me.
                        Caſt me not awaie from thy preſence: and take not thy holie ſpirit from me.
                        O giue me the comfort of thy helpe againe: and ſtabliſh me with thy free ſpirit.
                        Then ſhall I teach thy waies vnto the wicked: and ſinners ſhall be conuerted vnto thee.
                        Deliuer me from bloud-giltineſſe, O God, thou that art the God of my health: and my tongue ſhall ſing of thy righteouſneſſe.
                        Thou ſhalt open my lips O Lord: and my mouth ſhall ſhew thy praiſe.
                        For thou deſireſt no ſacrifice, elſe would I giue it thee: but thou delighteſt not in burnt offerings.
                        The ſacrifice of God is a troubled ſpirit: a broken and contrite hart, O God, ſhalt thou not deſpiſe.
                        O be fauourable and gratious to Sion: build thou the walles of Hieruſalem.
                        Then ſhalt thou be pleaſed with the ſacrifice of righteouſneſſe, with the burnt offerings and oblations: then ſhall they offer yong bullocks vpon thine altar.

                        Hide not thy face from me in the time of my trouble: incline thine eares vnto me when I

call, O heare me, and that right ſoone.
                        For my daies are conſumed awaie like ſmoke: and my bones are burnt vp as it were a firebrand.
                        My hart is ſmitten downe, and withered like graſſe: ſo that I forget to eate my bread.
                        For the voice of my groaning: my bones will ſcarſe cleaue to my fleſh.
                        I am become like a Pellicane in the wilderneſſe: and like an Owle that is in the deſert.
                        I haue watched, & am euen as it were a Sparowe: that ſitteth alone vpon the houſe top.
                        Mine enimies reuile me all the daie long: and they that are mad vpō me, are ſworne togither againſt me.
                        For I haue eaten aſhes as it were bread: and mingled my drinke with weeping.
                        And that becauſe of thine indignation and wrath: for thou haſt taken me vp, and caſt me downe.
                        My daies are gone like a ſhadowe: and I am withered like graſſe.
                        But thou, O Lord, ſhalt endure for euer: and thy remembrance throughout all generations.
                        Thou ſhalt ariſe and haue mercie vpon Sion: for it is time that thou haue mercie vpon hir, yea the time is come.
                        And why? thy ſeruants thinke vpon hir ſtones: and it pitieth them to ſee hir in the duſt.
                        The heathen ſhall feare thy name, O Lord: and all the kings of the earth thy Maieſtie.
                        When the Lord ſhall build vp Sion: and when his glorie ſhall appeare.
                        When he turneth him vnto the praier of the poore deſtitute: and deſpiſeth not their deſire.
                        This ſhall be written for thoſe that come after: and the people which ſhall be borne, ſhall praiſe the Lord.
                        For he hath looked downe from his Sanctuarie: out of the heauen did the Lord behold the earth.
                        
                           
That he might heare the mournings of ſuch as bee in captiuitie: and deliuer the children appointed vnto death.
                        That they may declare the name of the Lord in Sion: and his woorſhip at Hieruſalem.
                        When the people are gathered togither: and the kingdomes alſo to ſerue the Lord.
                        He brought downe my ſtrength in my iournie: and ſhortened my daies.
                        But I ſaid, O my God, take me not awaie in the midſt of mine age: as for thy yeares they endure thoroughout all generations.
                        Thou Lord in the beginning haſt laid the foundations of the earth: and the heauens are the worke of thy hands.
                        They ſhall periſh, but thou ſhalt endure: they ſhall all waxe old as doth a garment.
                        And as a veſture ſhalt thou change them, and they ſhall be changed: but thou art the ſame, and thy yeares ſhall not faile.
                        The children of thy ſeruants ſhall continue: and their ſeed ſhall ſtand faſt in thy ſight.

                        For the enimie hath perſecuted my ſoule, he hath ſmitten my life downe to the ground: he hath laid me in the darkeneſſe, as the men that haue beene long dead.
                        Therefore is my ſpirit vexed within me: and my heart within me is deſolate.
                        Yet doo I remember the time paſt, I muſe vpon all thy works: yea, I exerciſe my ſelfe in the works of thy hands.
                        I ſtretch foorth my hands vnto thee: my ſoule gaſpeth vnto thee as a thirſtie land.
                        Heare me, O Lord, and that ſoone, for my ſpirit wareth faint: hide not thy face from me, leaſt I be like vnto them that go downe into the pit.
                        O let me heare thy louing kindnes betimes in the morning, for in thee is my truſt: ſhew thou me the waie that I ſhould walke in, for I lift vp my ſoule vnto thee.
                        Deliuer me, O Lord, from mine enimies: for I flee vnto thee to hide me.
                        Teach me to doo the thing that pleaſeth thee, for thou art my God: let thy louing ſpirit leade me foorth into the land of righteouſneſſe.
                        Quicken me, O Lord, for thy name ſake: and for thy righteouſneſſe ſake bring my ſoule out of trouble.
                        
                           
And of thy goodneſſe ſlaie mine enimies: and deſtroie all them that vexe my ſoule, for I am thy ſeruant.

                        Heerevnto you may adde (as occaſion and time will ſerue) theſe ſelect and notable Pſalmes of Dauid, as they are at large in the Pſalter, that is to ſaie, the 5, 7, 13, 17, 22, 25, 31, 35, 42, 43, 55, 56, 57, 69, 71, 77, 86, 88.
                     
                  
                  
                     Other Pſalmes or Praiers, compiled out of holie Scriptures, verie neceſſarie to be vſed of the afflicted ſoule, for obteining the remiſſion of ſinnes, and mitigation of miſeries.
                     
                        O Lord of lords, GOD almightie, great and dreadfull, which by thy word haſt made heauen, earth, the ſea, & all things conteined in them.
                     Nothing is able to reſiſt thy power: thy mercie is ouer all thy works.
                     All things be vnder thy dominion and rule: both man and beaſt, and all liuing creatures.
                     Thou art mercifull to whome thou wilt: and haſt compaſſion on whome it pleaſeth thee.
                     Thy counſell ſhall ſtand for euer: and whatſoeuer thou wilt, ſhall be done.
                     Power, dominion, and glorie, is thine: which art aboue all things, and in all things, and in vs all.
                     Thou art Father of mercies, and God of all grace, peace and comfort: which wilt not the death of a ſinner, nor delighteſt in the damnation of ſoules.
                     
                        
O Lord God, which art rich in mercie, and of thine eſpeciall loue towards vs, euen when we were thine enimies, didſt ſend into the world thine onelie begotten Sonne Ieſus Chriſt; that whoſoeuer beleeueth dulie in him ſhall not periſh, but haue euerlaſting life.
                     Haue mercie vpon me, haue mercie vpon me, according to thy great mercie.
                     And according to the multitude of thy mercies, put awaie mine offences.
                     O God moſt holie, waſh me from my wickedneſſe, and make me cleane from mine vncleanneſſe.
                     For I acknowledge, O Lord, my heinous ſinnes: and accuſe my ſelfe of mine vnrighteous deeds.
                     I confeſſe againſt my ſelfe the wickedneſſe of mine hart, which hath beene euer vnfaithfull, and rebelling againſt thy precepts.
                     I haue beene an vntrue and froward child to thee, and haue prouoked thee with my vanities.
                     O holie Father, I haue offended thy diuine Maieſtie, and am not woorthie to be called thy child.
                     Bicauſe I prouoked thee to anger through the multitude of my ſinnes: and haue not exerciſed my ſelfe in thy righteous lawes.
                     I haue turned backe from thy waies, and done euill before thee.
                     I haue done wickedlie, and vniuſtlie behaued my ſelfe, leauing thy commandements, and murmuring againſt thy correction.
                     I haue turned my ſelfe awaie, and not kept my promiſe made vnto thee: I haue walked in an euill waie after mine owne thoughts and fantaſies, chooſing the things that thou wouldeſt not.
                     O Lord God almightie, I haue not feared thee, nor ſhewed due reuerence vnto thee: but I haue beene diſobedient and ſtubborne vnto thee.
                     As a common harlot is without ſhame, euen ſo am

I without ſhame of my ſinnes: for behold, I ſpeake vnto thee, and yet I ſinne more and more.
                     I haue left that which is good, and gone backe from thee: and I haue not put my truſt and hope in thee, my maker; but haue ſought for helpe and ſafegard otherwiſe.
                     I haue ploughed wickedneſſe, and reaped iniquitie, and eaten the fruit of lies: bicauſe I haue truſted in mine owne waie.
                     I haue caſt thy lawes behind my backe, not regarding thy commandements, nor leauing mine owne lewd cuſtoms.
                     I haue not giuen my hart to returne to thy paths: for I would not knowe thee, but haue fallen through mine iniquitie.
                     I neuer vnto this daie turned trulie vnto thee with all my hart: but as a woman that breakech hir fidelitie and promiſe vnto hir huſband: euen ſo, O LORD God, I haue broken my promiſe vnto thee.
                     For I haue liued abhominablie, and haue had no remorſe, nor repentance for my euill deeds, but haue run from ſinne to ſinne, following the lewd deſires of my hart.
                     Thou knoweſt all things, O Lord, how I haue prouoked thee to diſpleaſure by my lewd inuentions: and none of all my ſinnes be hid from thee.
                     I hated thy diſcipline and correction: and regarded not thy words and ſaiengs.
                     I haue not done penance for my malice: but haue increaſed in much vanitie.
                     Mine hart hath beene void of truth: and my hands haue wrought vnrighteouſneſſe.
                     My tongue hath ſpoken ſinfullie, and I haue laboured with the imaginations of mine hart, to find out lies and deceits, and no truth hath beene in my waies.
                     I haue accuſtomed my tongue to ſpeake trifles and

vanities, fulfilling my fleſhlie deſires and thoughts, my purpoſes and inuentions haue beene contrarie to thy will, whereby I haue offended the eies of thy Maieſtie.
                     Thou haſt ſeene all theſe things, O Lord, and haſt holden thy peace: and yet they were euill in thy ſight, and diſpleaſed thee.
                     In thine anger thou haſt caſt me awaie, and art diuided from me now manie daies.
                     Thou haſt giuen me vp to the deſires of my hart: to doo the things, which be not ſeeming.
                     Wo I am, that I haue gone from thee: great is my miſerie, that I haue led my life in ſinne.
                     Wo is me, that I haue forſaken thee to doo my deuiſes: not after thy mind, to accompliſh my thoughts, which haue not proceeded of thy ſpirit, but haue heaped vp ſinne vpon ſinne.
                     Mine infamie and reproch is dailie before mine eies: and for ſhame I dare not ſhew my face.
                     And now, O Lord God, why forgetteſt thou mee? Why keepeſt thou awaie ſo long thy mercie from me?
                     Heare now my cauſe gratiouſlie, although thou haſt beene diſpleaſed with me a great while: for thou art mercifull; be not angrie alwaies, I beſeech thee.
                     Caſt not awaie a contrite and penitent perſon, a wretch, and an abiect, which humblie calleth vpon thy name.
                     Turne againe a little toward me, O Lord God, and forgiue me my miſchieuous deeds.
                     Order me not according to my ſinnes, nor puniſh me as my wickedneſſe deſerueth.
                     Shew not foorth thy power againſt a poore wretch: perſecute hir not ſo ſore, which is without all ſtrength.
                     Turne not thy face awaie from my praiers: but according to thy promiſe, take me againe vnto thy fauour.
                     
                        
For I am thine, O righteous Father, whom thine onlie deere Sonne hath redeemed with his pretious bloud.
                     And now my ſoule abhorreth mine old conuerſation: and of thee, which art iudge of all men, I aſke mercie.
                     I doo ſubmit my ſelfe vnto thy mightie hand: for after thine anger thou ſheweſt mercie, and in the time of tribulation thou dooeſt forgiue ſinnes.
                     I acknowledge, that I am a ſinner, beſeeching thee, Lord God almightie, of thy goodneſſe to doo with mee according to thy great mercie.
                     I am confounded, and aſhamed to lift vp mine eies vnto thee: for my ſinnes are aſcended vp vnto thy ſight.
                     Againſt thee, O Father, againſt thee haue I ſinned, and done euill before thee: thou ſeeſt that mine iniquitie is great.
                     Trulie I haue beene an offender againſt thee, euen from my cradle: and ſince I ſucked my mothers breſts, I haue not ceaſed to doo euill.
                     Behold, I was begotten in iniquitie: and my mother brought me into this world defiled with ſinne.
                     For the corne of an euill ſeed is ſowne in mine hart, and how much wickedneſſe hath ſproong thereof vnto this daie, thou knoweſt, O Lord.
                     I can not ſhake off my ſinnes and offences; but I carie ſtill with me the infamie of my youth.
                     Behold Lord, I am ſold vnder ſinne, and in my fleſh I find not that which is good.
                     For the good that I would, that doo I not; but the euill that I hate, that I doo.
                     All the thoughts and imaginations of mine hart haue beene ſet to doo euill, euer ſince I was yoong.
                     O why doo I die in my ſinnes, Lord God: ſeeing thy will is not, that a ſinner die, but returne from his ſin and liue?
                     For thou art good and mercifull, and according to

thy great mercie, ſaueſt them that be vnwoorthie.
                     For albeit no man is able to beare the puniſhment, which thou dooſt threaten againſt ſinners, yet the mercie, which thou haſt promiſed, is great and vnſearchable.
                     Thou haſt ſhewed mercie a thouſand times heretofore: to make the ſame glorious, as it is euen yet ſtill.
                     The old fathers in their neceſſities cried vnto thee, and thou diddeſt deliuer them: they put their truſt in thee, and they were not confounded.
                     When they were at their wits end, and wiſt not what to doo: this was their onelie refuge, to lift vp their eies to thee.
                     Thou didſt ſaue them for thy name ſake, to ſhew in them thy might and ſtrength.
                     Manie a time they prouoked thee through their iniquities, and ſtirred vp thy goodneſſe to diſpleaſure.
                     Yet when thou ſaweſt their tribulation, and their lowlie ſubmiſſion vnto thee;
                     Thou diddeſt remember thy promiſe, and by and by hadſt pitie and compaſſion vpon them: according to the multitude of thy mercies.
                     Haue mercie vpon me, O Lord God omnipotent, haue mercie vpon me: for I am a miſerable & a wretched creature. Make me whole, I beſeech thee, whom thou haſt ſtriken for my ſinne and iniquitie.
                     My ſoule is troubled greatlie: and how long, O Lord, wilt thou not looke towards me?
                     How long wilt thou reiect my praier, thus crieng out vnto thee? Wilt thou heare me at no time? How long wilt thou turne awaie thy face from me?
                     Where be thine old mercies, O Lord, whom thou haſt ſtabliſhed in thy truth?
                     Wilt thou now, O Lord God, ceaſe to ſhew mercie? Or wilt thou withdrawe thy goodneſſe in diſpleaſure?
                     Haſt thou caſt me awaie for euer, that thou wilt neuer

hereafter be pleaſed with me?
                     Thine hand is not weakened, but it may helpe: and thine eares be not ſtopped, that they refuſe to heare.
                     How long ſhall my mind be troubled with painfull and heauie thoughts? How long ſhall ſorowe torment mine hart?
                     How long ſhall mine enimie haue the vpper hand of me? Looke towards me, Lord GOD, and heare my praier.
                     Giue light to mine eies: for I haue ſlept too long in death, and my ſinnes haue preuailed againſt me.
                     Turne againe, O Lord, turne againe, and deliuer my ſoule: and ſaue me for thy great mercie ſake.
                     Lo, now is the accepted time: now be the daies of health and grace.
                     In death, who ſhall remember thee? In hell, who ſhall laud or praiſe thee?
                     He that liueth, he that liueth ſhall praiſe thee: and ſhall make thy mercie knowne.
                     Lord rebuke me not in thine anger: nor puniſh me in thy great diſpleaſure.
                     Caſt not thy darts at me: nor laie not thy heauie hand vpon me.
                     For I haue borne thine anger a long while: & of the cup of thy high diſpleaſure I haue droonke verie deepe.
                     There is no health in my fleſh, for feare of thy diſpleaſure: I haue no peace nor reſt, when I behold my ſinnes.
                     Mine iniquities be gone ouer mine head: and like an heauie burden they dailie preſſe me downe.
                     The wounds in my ſoule doo feſter and ſtinke, euen through mine owne follie.
                     I am a wretch caſt awaie from thy fauour and preſence, and go moorning all the daie long.
                     My ſoule is full of filthineſſe, and no part of mee is whole and ſound.
                     
                        
Wherfore mine enimies doo perſecute me the more, the greatnes of my paine maketh me to rore and crie.
                     My heart fainteth and trembleth within me, and my ſtrength is gone awaie.
                     O Lord, thou knoweſt my deſire, and thou ſeeſt my neceſſitie.
                     Forgiue me all my ſinnes, O Lord God almightie, for thine owne ſake, and put out of thy ſight my hainous offences: for according to thy goodneſſe thou haſt promiſed forgiueneſſe of ſinnes to them that doo pennance.
                     Haue mercie on me Lord for the glorie and honour of thy name, and be no longer diſpleaſed with me, and then thou ſhalt ſurelie be knowne to be iuſt and true in thy words, & ſhalt ouercome when thou art iudged.
                     For by this, thy great grace ſhall be knowne: that thou takeſt mercie on them, which haue not whereof they may glorie in thy ſight.
                     And all the dwellers on the earth ſhall learne and knowe thy goodneſſe, when thou ſhalt confer and giue thy benefits to vs for thy great name ſake, and not after our euill waies and wicked deeds.
                     Uerelie Lord God, except thou ſhew vnto vs thy manifold mercies, the world ſhall not haue life, nor they that dwell therein.
                     And if thou helpe vs not with thy goodneſſe, how may they which haue offended, be raiſed vp from their ſinnes?
                     Haue mercie on me, O good Father, haue mercie on me, and for thy glorious name, be no longer angrie with me.
                     Take me a ſinner vnto thy mercie for the name of thy holie Sonne Ieſu, whome thou haſt ſent to be the obteiner of mercie for our ſinnes, through faith in his bloud.
                     Behold holie Father, behold thy child, whome thou

haſt choſen: behold thy welbeloued Sonne, in whome thy ſoule delighteth: vpon whome thou haſt put thy holie ſpirit, and ſent him to preach the Goſpell to the poore; to heale them, which for their ſinnes be ſorowfull and contrite: to comfort them that mourne, to preach pardon to the priſoners, and ſight to the blind.
                     Behold thy little one, which was borne for vs; behold thy Sonne, which is giuen to vs, whome thou haſt not ſpared, but giuen to death for vs all, to be a ſweet offering and ſacrifice to thee.
                     Uerelie he tooke vpon him in his bodie our infirmities, and he bare our paines.
                     He was made weake for our ſinnes: and he was wounded for our offences.
                     The correction for our peace was laid vpon him, and by ye ſtrokes that he ſuffered, our wounds were healed.
                     All we went aſtraie like ſheepe, euerie one followeth his owne waie, and thou, O Lord, putteſt on him our iniquitie, ſtriking him for the offences of thy people.
                     He gaue his bodie to be beaten, and his cheekes to be ſtricken, he turned not awaie his face from them that ſcorned him.
                     Through his loue and mercie, he hath redeemed them that were loſt, and by his bloud ſhead on the croſſe, he hath pacified all things in heauen and earth.
                     He gaue himſelfe to death, and made his praiers for them which were offenders.
                     Looke O mercifull Father, and conſider who it is that thus did ſuffer: and remember, I beſeech thee, for whome he hath ſuffered.
                     For this is that innocent, whome thou gaueſt to death for vs, euen then when we were ſinners: and ſhall we not, being now iuſtified by his bloud, much rather be ſaued from wrath through him?
                     If we, when we were yet enimies, were reconciled to thee by the death of thy Sonne, ſhall we not being

reconciled, much rather be ſaued by his life?
                     Behold that pure and immaculate Lambe, which taketh awaie the ſinnes of the world, by whoſe pretious bloud we are redeemed from our iniquities.
                     Looke vpon that moſt meeke innocent, which like a Lambe was led to his death: and being moſt cruellie intreated, once opened not his mouth.
                     Behold thine onlie Sonne, whome although thou begatteſt of thine almightie power, ſubſtance and nature; yet thou wouldeſt he ſhould be partaker of mine infirmitie.
                     Which being God in nature, thought it no rauine to be equall with God, but made himſelfe lowe, taking vpon him the ſhape of a ſeruant, and comming in the ſimilitude of ſinfull fleſh, condemned ſinne in the fleſh, ſubmitting himſelfe vnto thee, O Father, euen to the death of the croſſe, and there put out the hand-writing that was againſt vs conteined in the lawe written, and taking it out of the waie, faſtned it to his croſſe, on the which he ſpoiled poteſtates and powers, and made a ſhew of them openlie, and triumphed ouer them in his owne perſon.
                     Turne the eies of thy Maieſtie, O Lord God, and looke vpon the worke of thine ineffable goodneſſe.
                     Behold thine owne ſweet Sonne, how all his bodie was drawne and ſtretched foorth on the croſſe.
                     Looke vpon all the parts of his bodie, from the crowne of the head, vnto the ſole of the foote, and no paine ſhall be found like vnto his paine.
                     Behold, O louing Father, the bleſſed head of thy deere Sonne crowned with ſharpe thornes, and the bloud running downe vpon his godlie viſage.
                     Behold his tender bodie, how it is ſcourged: his naked breſt is ſtricken and beaten: his bloudie ſide is thruſt through: his heart panteth: his ſinewes bee ſtretched foorth: his godlie eies dazell, and leeſe their

ſight: his princelie face is wanne and pale: his pleaſant tongue is inflamed for paine: his inward parts waxe drie and ſtarke: his armes both blew & wanne, be ſtiffe: his bones be plucked one from another: his beautifull legs be feeble and weake: and the ſtreames of bloud iſſuing out of his bodie, ranne downe apace vpon his feet.
                     Looke, O my Father, vpon the humilitie and gentleneſſe of thy deere Sonne: and pitie the infirmitie of thy weake handie-worke.
                     Behold, O glorious Father, the bodie of thy deere Sonne, all to rent and torne: and remember I beſeech thee, of how ſmall ſubſtance I am.
                     Looke vpon the paine of him that is both God and man: and releaſe the miſerie of man whome thou haſt made.
                     Behold the greeuous ſuffering of the Redeemer, and forgiue the ſinne of hir that is redeemed.
                     Keepe me from all euill waies: and teach me by thy holie ſpirit, to chooſe the waie of truth.
                     I beſeech thee, O thou king of holineſſe, by him that is moſt holie, by this my Redeemer Chriſt, that thou bring me againe into the right waie, that I may be vnited, and made one with him in ſpirit, which abhorred not to be vnited with me in fleſh.
                     Make me to go perfectlie in thy paths, and to hate all wicked waies.
                     Waſh my hart from malice, and clenſe me from my ſecret ſinnes.
                     Clenſe me, O holie Father, with the bloud of the new teſtament of thy welbeloued Sonne, which hath loued vs, and waſhed vs with his bloud from our ſinnes, and hath redeemed vs from all iniquitie.
                     Purifie my heart by the ſanctification of thy ſpirit, and the ſprinkling of the bloud of thy Sonne, from all filthineſſe of ſinne, and euill conſcience.
                     
                        
O God almightie, be mercifull vnto me a ſinner: for thy glorious name ſake, and remember my ſinnes no longer.
                     For thou art God, gratious, and mercifull, and patientlie dooeſt ſuffer vs: and wouldeſt that no man ſhould periſh, but yt all men ſhould returne to penance.
                     Make me, O Lord God, to returne from mine euill waies and wicked thoughts.
                     Remember not the ſinnes and abhominations of my youth: according to thy mercie, be mindfull of mee for thy goodneſſe ſake O Lord.
                     Looke not vpon me with a grienous countenance: for there is no man that dare ſpeake for me.
                     Enter not into iudgement with thy ſeruant: for if thou accuſe me, I ſhall neuer be quit.
                     For if thou, O Lord, marke my ſinnes and iniquitie, who ſhall not fall before thee?
                     This is certaine and ſure, that then in thy ſight no man liuing ſhall be iuſtified, ſeeing thou haſt found iniquitie euen in thine Angels.
                     How much rather in man, which is abhomination and filthineſſe, and dwelleth in the earthlie houſe of his bodie, and drinketh iniquitie as it were water?
                     Who is cleane from filthineſſe, when all be corrupted? trulie not one: no though he haue liued but one daie on the earth, and though his moneths may be eaſilie numbered.
                     Of a truth there is no mortall man, which hath not done wickedlie; nor there is anie righteous on earth, which doth good and ſinneth not.
                     Yet becauſe mercie is in thy hand, O Lord, although thou be dreadfull, my hope is in thee, in whome my ſoule truſteth.
                     My ſoule looketh for thee, becauſe mercie and plentifull redemption is with thee.
                     For this I knowe aſſuredlie, that thou wilt not caſt

me awaie for euer: but although thou caſt me awaie for my ſinnes awhile, yet thou wilt haue mercie vpon me againe, according to the multitude of thy mercies.
                     For thou, O Lord, art full of pitie and mercie: and wilt not turne thy face awaie from vs, if we will returne to thee.
                     Thou art our God, full of ſweetneſſe, veritie, and patience, and diſpoſeſt all things by mercie.
                     The fountaines of thy goodneſſe be euer full, and flowe ouer: thy grace neuer decaieth.
                     All thy waies be mercie and truth, to them that ſeeke out thy couenant and teſtimonies.
                     How gentle and louing the father is to his children, ſo gentle and louing art thou O Lord, to them that feare thee, and for the aboundance of thy mercie thou dooeſt pardon our infirmities.
                     Thou knoweſt thine owne handie-worke, thou remembreſt what we are: thou ſeeſt we are fleſh, and of no ſtrength.
                     Thou haſt not forgotten, that this world is full of vnrighteouſneſſe and wickedneſſe: and that it is wholie ſet and bent on euill.
                     Yea, neuertheleſſe thou art mercifull and full of grace, and like a mercifull Lord, forbeareſt to puniſh ſinners when they repent themſelues, and returne from their ſinnes.
                     Haue mercie vpon me, O Lord God my ſauiour, for the glorie of thy name: and deliuer me, and forgiue me my ſinnes for thy name ſake.
                     O righteous Father, looke not ſtraitelie vpon the multitude of my ſinnes: but looke on the face of Ieſus thy holie Sonne, which being without ſinne, bare our ſinnes in his bodie on the tree of the croſſe.
                     Turne awaie thy face from my ſinnes: and put out all mine iniquities.
                     Make a cleane hart in mee, O God, and renew mee

with a right ſpirit.
                     Caſt me not awaie from thy preſence, and take not thine holie ſpirit from me.
                     Giue me againe the comfort of thy helpe, and ſtabliſh me with thy mightie ſpirit.
                     Mollifie mine hart, O Lord GOD, that I may returne to thy paths: for I haue wandered ouer long in the waie of errour.
                     Turne me to thee, and I ſhall be turned: for thou art my maker, and I am the claie and worke of thine hands.
                     Turne not thy face awaie from me, nor go not from thy ſeruant in thine anger.
                     Be mine helper, and forſake me not: deſpiſe me not, O Lord, which art my God, and my health,
                     Amen.
                  
                  
                     Another Pſalme for the remiſſion of ſinnes.
                     
                     
                        O Moſt mightie GOD of Angels and of men: whoſe iudgements be vnſearchable, & whoſe wiſedome is profound and deepe.
                     Neare the praiers of thy ſeruants: and caſt not awaie the humble ſuits of thy poore creature and handie worke.
                     For as long as I ſhall liue, I will ſpeake vnto thee: and I will not hold my peace, ſo long as the breth is in my bodie.
                     I doo turne my ſoule vnto thee, and I ſet mine eies directlie vpon thee.
                     Let thine anger be turned awaie from me, I beſeech thee, and grant that I may find grace and fauour in thy ſight.
                     According to the greatneſſe of thy mercie, forgiue me all my ſinnes.
                     Plucke me awaie from mine heinous offences: and heale my ſoule, which hath offended thee; make me free

from the guilt of my tranſgreſſion: for I acknowledge mine iniquitie, and am ſorie for my ſinnes.
                     I haue forſaken thy waie; and I, knowing thy commandements, haue done all things contrarie to them.
                     I haue broken the couenant that I made with thee: and haue deſpiſed to keepe thy lawe.
                     Uerelie I haue ſinned againſt thee, O Lord GOD, and the blemiſh of my ſinne abideth ſtill with me, euen vnto this daie.
                     I haue forſaken thee, O God my maker, and gone awaie from thee my Sauiour, & haue rebelled againſt thee, like an oxe that winceth and ſtriueth when hee ſhould be yoked.
                     I haue hardened my hart againſt thee: and I haue lifted vp my necke proudlie after my ſinne.
                     I haue truſted in lies, and through deceit would not knowledge thee: but I haue followed the lewdneſſe of mine hart.
                     My pride and arrogancie haue beguiled me: and the fooliſh boldneſſe of mine hart hath brought me into deſolate waies.
                     Mine owne counſels and aduiſes haue brought me theſe things: ſuch is the malice and rebellion that poſſeſſeth the harts of men.
                     My ſoule is put from quietneſſe and reſt, and I can not thinke of anie good thing.
                     The yoke of my ſinnes is waxed verie heauie: it is lifted vp and faſtened about my necke.
                     Thou haſt ſpoken to me, but I would not heare; thou haſt called me, but I would not anſwere: I beleeued not thy words, nor would abide thy counſell.
                     I regarded not thine holie word: and I gaue not my mind to thy ſaiengs.
                     Thou haſt ſtriken me, but I would not knowe the cauſe thereof: thou haſt corrected me, but I would not take thy diſcipline.
                     
                        
I did not conſider in mine hart, that thou wouldeſt not forget my ſinne and malice.
                     With my mouth and my lips I glorified thee: but mine hart was farre from thee.
                     I hid my ſinne as Adam did: to the intent to haue mine iniquitie vnknowne.
                     I aſked not counſell of thy mouth: and I would not followe thy lawe.
                     I haue ſinned before thine eies, and therefore my ſoule is made vnſtable.
                     I forſooke thee, which art the fountaine of continuall ſpringing waters: to the intent to dig to my ſelfe muddie pits, which haue no water.
                     In all theſe things I am not returned to thee: nor I haue not praied vnto thee, that I might leaue my wicked waies.
                     See Lord, and behold how vile I am made, all the beautie of my ſoule is periſhed and gone: in ſo much that now I dare not in anie wiſe behold and looke vpon thee.
                     And there was no cauſe why I ſhould forſake thee, and vainlie followe vaine things.
                     Lord haue mercie vpon me, and heare my praiers: for thou art my God, and there is no Sauiour beſides thee.
                     Turne awaie from me thy heauie diſpleaſure: and deſtroie me not for the ſinnes of my youth.
                     I humblie beſeech thee, O Lord, forgiue me: forgiue me for thine exceeding mercie.
                     O Lord God of hoſts, if thou be determined to ſaue, who can let orreſiſt? If thou ſtretch out thine hand, who ſhall turne thee awaie?
                     Thou maiſt doo to me, as the potter doth to his pot: for behold, I am in thine hand, as the claie is in his.
                     Amend me, O Lord, but in mercie, not in thine anger, leaſt thou vtterlie conſume me: make me to vnderſtand

and knowe how hurtfull and deadlie a thing it is to forſake thee, my Lord GOD, and to caſt awaie from me, the feare of thee.
                     There is no man that can heale mee, nor cure my plague: no man can deliuer mee, but thou O Lord, which woundeſt, and makeſt whole; which ſtrikeſt, and healeſt againe.
                     My deſtruction commeth of my ſelfe: my helpe and ſaluation ſtandeth onelie in thee.
                     For none is like vnto thee: thou art mightie, and great is the name of thy ſtrength.
                     Turne me to thee, O Lord, and I ſhall be turned: take awaie from mee this ſinfull hart, that thy lawe may bring foorth fruit in me.
                     Remember me, Lord, for thy goodneſſe ſake: and for the great loue thou beareſt towards me.
                     O Lord God, behold, thou haſt made both heauen and earth by thy great might: and nothing is hard to thee.
                     Thou art that puiſſant and mightie, whoſe name is the Lord of hoſts: great & maruellous in thy counſell.
                     As ſoone as thou haſt ſpoken the word, all things be done: as ſoone as thou haſt commanded, things be: and thy word returneth not to thee void, and without effect.
                     Thou, O Lord GOD, ſhe weſt mercie vnto all, for thou canſt doo all: and thou makeſt as though thou ſaweſt not the ſinnes of men, bicauſe they ſhould doo penance, and amend their liues.
                     For thou loueſt althings that be, and hateſt nothing that thou haſt made: for nothing thou madeſt, or haſt ordeined of anie hatred.
                     Thou ſpareſt and tendereſt all men: for all things be thine, and thou loueſt the ſoules of men.
                     Thou dooſt miniſter mercie, equitie, and iuſtice in the earth: and therefore in theſe vertues thou greatlie

delighteſt.
                     Trulie, O Lord, thou art righteous and gratious, notwithſtanding I haue offended thee, tranſgreſſing thy couenant, and treſpaſſing againſt thee.
                     O Lord, thou haſt ſeene all mine abhominations: looke on my cauſe, and conſider how vile and wretched I am: ſee and behold my great confuſion.
                     In the time of reconciliation heare me, and in the daie of ſaluation haue mercie on me.
                     Be mercifull vnto me, and haue mercie on me, which haue none other helpe but thee: whoſe will nothing can reſiſt, whenſoeuer thou dooſt purpoſe to ſaue.
                     Heare me, which am a wretch making ſupplication vnto thee: make me to truſt in thy name, and deliuer me by thy power.
                     Haue regard to me from heauen, O Lord, and looke downe from thine holie habitation, & from the throne of thy glorie.
                     Deſtroie me not bicauſe of mine iniquitie: but remember the ſorowe and paine that I ſuffer.
                     Be not ſtill angrie with me, O Lord, forget all my ſinnes, and remember them no longer.
                     Let my praier aſcend vp vnto thee, ſaie vnto my ſoule, Behold I am come to thee, thy helth, and thy ſaluation,
                     Amen.
                  
                  
                     Another Pſalme for the remiſſion of ſinnes.
                     
                     
                        O GOD eternall, iuſt, and holie, which keepeſt couenant and mercie with them that loue thee, and keepe thy commandements.
                     Looke at me, and haue mercie vpon me: for I haue treſpaſſed againſt thee, & done euil in thy ſight.
                     Shew foorth vpon me the tender affections of thy mercie, that thy ſeruant may haue an hart to praie vnto thee.
                     
                        
I humblie make my praier before thy face, not truſting in mine owne righteouſneſſe, but in thy great mercies.
                     For I am vncleane and filthie: and all my righteouſneſſe is like a foule bloudie clowt.
                     Unto thee, O Lord, be iuſtice, mercie, and pitie: but vnto me be confuſion and ſhame for mine iniquities.
                     Certainlie, euen from my beginning I haue vſed my ſelfe proudlie againſt thee, dooing wickedlie, and not ceaſing.
                     O Lord, thou haſt redeemed me, and yet I haue not ceaſed to offend thee, and mine hart hath not beene ſtraight in thy ſight.
                     Thou haſt taught and inſtructed me, and ſtabliſhed my power, and I haue beene euill affected towards thee, being like a deceitfull bowe.
                     My pride and preſumption accuſe me to my face, I am ouerthrowne in mine owne wickedneſſe: I doo ſeeke thee, O Lord, I beſeech thee that I may find thee: thou art ſeparated from me, for I haue greedilie followed filthineſſe.
                     Yet will I accuſe mine owne ſinfull waies before thee, O Lord, vntill thou haue mercie vpon me, and receiue me againe into thy fauour.
                     God forbid, that euer I ſhould depart from thee againe, and not diligentlie ſeeke for thy promiſes.
                     I will neuer hold my peace, nor keepe ſilence: vntill thou haue eſtabliſhed that couenant with me, which thou haſt made and ordeined in times paſt.
                     That is to ſaie, like as the iuſtice of a iuſt man ſhall not deliuer or ſaue him, what time ſoeuer he ſhall offend: ſo the wickedneſſe of a wicked man ſhall not hurt him, what time ſoeuer he ſhall returne from his wickedneſſe.
                     In hope of this, O Lord God, I will tarie thy pleaſure: for thou art good to them that truſt in thee, and

to the ſoule that ſeeketh thee.
                     Thou keepeſt thy truth for euermore: and the words which iſſue foorth of thy mouth, ſhall not be void, and of none effect.
                     Deſtroie me not good Lord, for my ſinnes: nor reſerue not eternall puniſhment for me.
                     Open thine eies, and behold the greatneſſe of my paine and mine affliction: for mine iniquitie is great in thy ſight, and my ſinnes haue brought me into this trouble.
                     Deſtroie me not vtterlie, nor leaue me in my ſinnes: for thou art God of mercie, and verie gratious.
                     Execute not the puniſhment vpon me, which thou haddeſt purpoſed: doo to me according to thy name, although my defaults and ſinnes be manie.
                     O Lord, thou art my God; and thy name hath beene put vpon me: leaue me not in the deepeneſſe of my troubles.
                     Thou haſt chaſtiſed and reformed manie, and haſt ſtrengthned the wearie hands; thy words haue ſet vp him that ſtaggered, and thou haſt made ſtreight the crooked knees.
                     Wherefore I will ſeeke thee O Lord God, which haſt wrought great things, vnſearchable & innumerable.
                     Thou haſt taken vp the poore out of the duſt, and haſt exalted them, which were abiects.
                     For thou dooeſt deliuer the poore in his miſerie out of the ſtraite and bottomleſſe pit of tribulation: and out of the wide mouth of anguiſh and affliction, into reſt and quietneſſe.
                     Thou art gratious and mercifull, for that thou ſheweſt mercie to them, which be not yet come into the world: and thou art verie mercifull to them, which diligentlie obſerue and keepe thy lawes; and thou dooeſt patientlie ſuffer ſinners, giuing them time and place, wherby they may be changed from their malice.
                     
                        
Heare me poore wretch making ſupplication vnto thee, for in thee and thy name I haue put my truſt and affiance.
                     Take me thy ſeruant vnto thee, and make me good, and let me not be diſappointed of that that I looke for.
                     Come againe O Lord God, and ſaue my ſoule: deſtroie me not, whome thou haſt redeemed by thy great might and power.
                     Looke not vpon the hardneſſe of my hart, nor vpon my ſinnes; but like as thou haſt manie times ſhewed mercie, ſo now be mercifull, and forgiue me.
                     Heare me, O Lord, and be pacified: regard my praier, and doo according to thy great name.
                     O Lord, I looke to haue helpe and ſaluation from thee: and this is my dailie meditation and exerciſe.
                     For thy mercies be great: and thy goodneſſe is ineſtimable.
                     Heare me now fauourablie: and with-hold thy mercies no longer from me.
                     In the waie of thy iudgements I will looke after thee: my ſoule deſireth to magnifie thy name, and to haue thee in memorie.
                     Incline my hart to doo thy commandements: and direct my waies euermore in thy ſight.
                     Let me neuer heereafter go awaie from thy waies: nor leaue me not now in the deepeneſſe of my troubles.
                     Turne not thine eies awaie from me, but teach me, O Lord, to doo thoſe things which are pleaſant in thy ſight.
                     Make a perpetuall league and couenant with me, that thou wilt put thy feare into my heart, that I neuer ſwarue from thee in all my life.
                     Withdrawe not thy goodneſſe from me for euer, but keepe thy promiſe and fidelitie.
                     Be good vnto me with beneuolence and fauour: for

thou art mercifull, and thy diſpleaſure continueth not for euer.
                     Remember me with fauour and kindneſſe: and viſit me with thy ſaluation.
                     I knowe, O Lord God, that thou art gratious and mercifull, patient, and of great mercifulneſſe.
                     Thou art good and mercifull, thou keepeſt couenant and mercie with thy ſeruants, which walke before thee in their whole heart.
                     There is none other God but thou, which regardeſt and careſt for all.
                     For thou haſt beene euer verie mercifull to me, deliuering my ſoule from the deepe hell.
                     Let thy goodneſſe, O Lord, be euer with me, for all my wealth reſteth onlie in thee.
                     In the time of tribulation, I call vpon thee, O Lord, for thou art nigh vnto them, which call vpon thy holie name.
                     Succour me, O God, and looke merilie vpon me: ſhew me the light of thy countenance, in thee my ſoule truſteth, and my hart reioiceth.
                     Let my praier come vnto thy throne: bow downe thine eare vnto my crie.
                     Heare me now being penitent, O Lord, whom thou haſt hitherto patientlie ſuffered: to the intent I ſhould repent and amend my life.
                     O God, I haue opened vnto thee my life: ſaue mee for thy name ſake, for my truſt is in thee.
                     What care I for worldlie things: this one thing onlie I need and deſire, that I may find grace and fauour in thy ſight.
                     Wherefore I beſeech thee, O Lord, take awaie from me this paine and ſorrowe: or at leaſt-wiſe mitigate and aſſwage it, either by comfort, or by counſell, or by what meanes ſoeuer it ſhall bee ſeene good to thee.
                  
                  
                     
                     Another Pſalme, or complaint of a penitent ſinner, which is ſore troubled and ouercome with ſinne.
                     
                        O Lord God mercifull and patient: and of much mercifulneſſe and truth.
                     Which for thine aboundant charitie, and according to thy great mercie, haſt taken vs out from the power of darkeneſſe: and haſt ſaued vs by the fountaine of regeneration and new birth, and the renewing of the holie Ghoſt: whome thou haſt ſhed vpon vs aboundantlie by Ieſu Chriſt our ſauiour.
                     If I haue found grace and fauour in thy ſight, ſuffer me to ſpeake a word vnto thee, and be not diſpleaſed with me.
                     Why dooeſt thou euer forget me, and leaueſt me in the middeſt of my troubles and euils?
                     Where is become thy zeale & thy ſtrength? Where is the multitude of thy tender affections, and of thy mercies?
                     O Lord, may not he which is fallen, riſe vp againe? Or may not he which hath gone awaie from thee, returne to thee againe?
                     Shall my ſorrowe euer endure? Shall my wound be incurable and neuer healed?
                     How commeth it to paſſe, that I turne ſtill awaie from thee? My ſinne dailie increaſeth, and of my ſelfe I can not returne.
                     In as much as it is not giuen to man to direct his owne waies, neither to make perfect his owne proceedings.
                     For in thy hand is the life of euerie liuing thing: and the ſpirit alſo of euerie man.
                     Thou ſheweſt thy mercie to whome thou wilt: and thou art gratious to them whome thou fauoureſt.
                     Thou dooeſt kill, and thou dooeſt quicken: thou leadeſt

downe to hell gate, and bringeſt vp againe.
                     Thine eies behold the waies of euerie man: and thou ſearcheſt the harts of men.
                     There is no place ſo ſecret or darke, wherein ſinners may hide themſelues from thee.
                     Nor anie man may ſo lurke and hide himſelfe in caues, but thou ſhalt ſee him, which dooeſt fulfill both heauen and earth in euerie part.
                     Why haſt thou caſt me awaie from thy preſence, and takeſt me for thine enimie?
                     Why haſt thou laid vpon my head the heauie weight of my ſinnes, ſeeing no man is able to beare thy diſpleaſure?
                     What meaneth it, that thou ſheweſt thy power againſt a wretch? Why deſtroieſt thou me for the ſinnes of my youth?
                     If I haue ſinned, what ſhall I doo to thee? And if my ſinnes be increaſed, what ſhall I doo?
                     If I doo iuſtlie, what ſhall I giue to thee? Or what ſhalt thou receiue at my hand?
                     My wickedneſſe ſhall hurt my ſelfe: and my righteouſneſſe ſhall profit me.
                     The life of man is a temptation vpon the earth: and if I haue ſinned, as all men haue, what may I doo?
                     Shall anie man be found cleane, and without ſinne before thee? Or ſhall anie man be without default in his deeds?
                     How may a mortall man be pure from ſinne in thy ſight? Or how may he, which is borne of a woman, be righteous?
                     Remember, O Lord, I beſeech thee, that thou haſt made me of the earth: and that thou ſhalt bring me againe into the duſt of death.
                     My daies paſſe and vaniſh awaie like ſmoke: they waſte dailie, there is no tarieng.
                     My life flieth awaie as the winde: and conſidereth

not that which is good.
                     I was but latelie borne into this world, and ſhortlie I ſhall be taken awaie hence by death: I neuer continue ſtill in one ſtate.
                     The daies of my life be few, and ſhort: thou haſt appointed an end, which I ſhall not paſſe.
                     Naked and bare I came out of my mothers wombe: and naked and bare I ſhall returne againe, trulie all men liuing are vanitie.
                     Haue pitie, O Lord, on them that are in miſerie: and deſpiſe not the works of thy hands.
                     Though we ſinne, yet are we vnder thee; for wee knowe thy power and ſtrength: and if we ſinne not, then are we ſure that thou regardeſt vs.
                     Ceaſe thine indignation, O Lord, and turne it from me: and caſt all my ſinnes behinde thy backe.
                     Take awaie thy plagues from me, for thy puniſhment hath made me both feeble and faint.
                     For when thou chaſtiſeſt a man for his ſinnes, thou cauſeſt him by and by to conſume and pine awaie.
                     Whatſoeuer is delectable in him periſheth, like vnto the cloth that is eaten with mothes.
                     Would God I had one to defend me a while, vntill thine anger were turned awaie: or that thou wouldeſt ſet me a time, in the which thou wouldeſt remember me.
                     I am cleane caſt awaie from thy preſence: ſhall I neuer heereafter ſee thy face againe?
                     Behold, I haue opened the griefes of my ſoule: the daies of my ſorrowes haue taken me.
                     The flouds of tribulation compaſſe me round about, and the ſtreames of thy furie run ouer me.
                     And I crie vnto thee, O Lord God, but thou heareſt me not: I aſke mercie, but thou reiecteſt my praiers.
                     Why thruſteſt thou downe a poore wretch from thy preſence? Or why forſakeſt thou me ſo long time?
                     
                        
Why takeſt thou not away mine iniquitie? And why putteſt thou not awaie the wickedneſſe of mine hart?
                     Ariſe, and tarie no longer, O Lord: ariſe, and reiect me not for euer.
                     Haue me in remembrance, I beſeech thee: for I thoroughlie tremble and ſhake for feare.
                     Yet I will not hold my tongue, but crie ſtill vnto thee with a moorning and an heauie hart.
                     Turne awaie the ſtroke of thy vengeance from me: bring my mind out of troubles into reſt.
                     I am here no long continuer, but a pilgrime, and a ſtranger, as all other mortall men be.
                     And what is man, that thou ſhouldſt be angrie with him? Or what is mankind, that thou ſhouldeſt be ſo heauie Lord vnto vs?
                     What? Wilt thou bring ſorowe vpon ſorowe? I pant for paine, and find no reſt.
                     My ſorowe greeueth me, when I ſhould eate, and ſudden ſighs ouerwhelme mine hart.
                     I am as if my bones were all to broken, when I heare mine enimies raile vpon me, and ſaie to me daie by daie; Where is thy God?
                     Why turneſt thou thy face awaie from theſe things, O Lord? Why haſt thou no regard of my trouble?
                     I earneſtlie make my praiers dailie in thy ſight, and the heauineſſe of mine hart I doo ſhew vnto thee.
                     My ſpirit is carefull and troubled within me: and deſperation hath entered into mine hart.
                     Is it thy pleaſure, O Lord God, to caſt awaie thine owne handie worke?
                     Deliuer my ſoule from corruption, and my life from euerlaſting darkneſſe.
                     What auaileth it me that euer I was borne, if thou caſt me ſtraight into damnation, ſeeing that the dead ſhall not praiſe thee: nor anie of them that go downe to hell?
                     
                        
I haue ſinned, what ſhall I doo to thee? Why haſt thou put me to be contrarie to thee? I am wearie of mine owne ſelfe.
                     Why ſearcheſt thou out my ſinnes ſo narrowlie: when there is no man that can take out of thine hand.
                     If I would ſaie, that I were righteous and without ſinne: then thou mighteſt woorthilie condemne me to the fire, prepared for the diuell and his angels.
                     But I confeſſe that I am a ſinner, and doo humble mine hart in thy ſight.
                     Surelie, if anie man would ſtand with thee in iudgment, he ſhall not be able to anſwere one word to a thouſand things, wherewith thou mighteſt charge him.
                     This maketh me to feare all my deeds: knowing that thou ſpareſt not him that offendeth.
                     If I looke vpon thy power, O how mightie and ſtrong art thou! If I ſhall call for iudgement, who ſhall defend my matter, or ſpeake for me?
                     To thee O Lord, I call and crie: to thee, my God, I make mine humble ſuite.
                     Turne awaie thine anger from me: that I may knowe that thou art more mercifull vnto me, than my ſinnes deſerue.
                     What is my ſtrength, that I may endure? Or what is the end of my trouble, that my ſoule may patientlie abide it?
                     My ſtrength is not a ſtonie ſtrength, and my fleſh is not made of braſſe.
                     There is no helpe in my ſelfe, and my ſtrength flieth awaie from me.
                     Although thou hide theſe things in thine hart: yet I knowe that thou wilt remember me at length.
                     For thou art true and iuſt, O Lord God, thou dooeſt not condemne vniuſtlie: which rewardeſt man according to his deſerts.
                     
                        
All this is come vpon me, bicauſe I haue forgotten thee: and not vſed my ſelfe trulie in thy teſtament.
                     Mine hart hath turned backward: and I haue followed the deſires of my fleſh.
                     And thou haſt ſurelie knowne this thing: which knoweſt the ſecrets of the hart.
                     Laie not againſt me, O Lord, the ſins of my youth: nor haue in remembrance mine old iniuries done againſt thee.
                     Dailie ſorowe ouercommeth me: and ſadneſſe poſſeſſeth mine hart.
                     I looke after peace, but I can not haue it: I looke for a time of health; but my greefe continueth ſtill.
                     When the time of thine anger is paſt, let mercie come: yet am I vnhappie more and more.
                     Wo and alas that euer I ſinned! mine hart therefore mourneth and is ſad, all mirth and ioie be baniſhed from me.
                     How am I waſted? How miſerablie am I confounded, bicauſe I haue forſaken and caſt awaie thy lawe?
                     Death hath aſcended vp by the windowes; pearcing the inward parts of mine hart.
                     When I dailie one while muſe ſecretlie with my ſelfe, another while with lowd voice crie out and complaine, the meane time my life draweth neere to the pit.
                     Who ſhall giue me a place to reſt in from all my griefes and troubles? And I will forſake all men, and get me awaie from them.
                     Who ſhall giue me water to mine head, and a fountaine of teares to mine eies, that I may bewaile my ſinnes both night and daie?
                     And I will looke for him, which may ſaue me, and deliuer me from the wrath to come.
                     I haue no truſt neither in life nor death: but I feare thy iudgement, O Lord, and the paines prepared for

wicked ſinners.
                     The feare of my ſinne maketh me carefull: and the burden of my conſcience oppreſſeth me ſore.
                     O GOD, which tenderlie loueſt mankind, and art a moſt rightfull iudge: ſpare me now, I beſeech thee, and ſhew me ſome fauour while time is.
                     Forgiue that, which I feare; put awaie that, which I dread: before I depart hence, and ſhall not returne againe.
                     My ſinnes doo vexe and trouble me ſore: they be ſo great that none can be greater.
                     Alas my fall! alas my miſerie! alas the griefe of my plague and ſtroke! certainlie my ſinne is the cauſe of all this, and ſo I will take and ſuffer it.
                  
                  
                     A verie deuout and effectuall praier vnto Chriſt, for mercie and grace, to be hartilie ſaid, and often vſed, eſpeciallie when ye faſt, or prepare your ſelfe to receiue the Communion.
                     
                     
                        O Lord Ieſu Chriſt, Sonne of the liuing GOD, which being vpon the Croſſe, with thine hands ſpred abroad, for the redemption of all mankind, didſt drinke the moſt bitter cup of thy paſſion, I beſeech thee that thou wouldeſt vouchſafe to giue me helpe this daie (or night) and euer. Lo, I a poore wretch come vnto thee, which art rich; a ſinner vnto thee that art mercifull: let mee not returne home contemned, and deſpiſed with nothing; I begin an hungred, let me not leaue off faſting; I come vnto thee, as though I were famiſhed, let me not go awaie vnfed. Although before I eate, I ſigh and ſorowe: yet after my ſorowe, giue me ſomewhat to eate.
                     Firſt of all, good Ieſu, I acknowledge before thy

Maieſtie mine vnrighteouſneſſe towards thee. Behold, O Lord, I was conceiued in ſinne, and borne in the ſame; and thou diddeſt waſh them off from me, and ſanctified me; but I afterward defiled my ſelfe with bigger, and more greeuous ſinnes. For I was borne in ſinne of neceſſitie, bicauſe I could be borne none otherwiſe: but afterward I rolled my ſelfe willinglie in ſinnes. Neuertheleſſe, thou O Lord, being mindfull of thy pitie, diddeſt take me out of the houſe of my carnall father, and out of the tents of the vngodlie, and haſt inſpired me, and put me in mind to followe thee with the generation of them that ſeeke thy face, of them that walke in the right path of puritie; of them that abide and continue among the lillies of virginitie and chaſtitie, and of them that ſit downe togither with thee at ſupper of moſt ſcarſitie and leaſt exceſſe.
                     But I an vnkind wretch, forgetting ſo manie great benefits, after that I was entered into thy ſeruice, haue committed manie vnlawfull things. I did offend woonderfull vngratiouſlie, dooing manie a foule ſinne. And where I ſhould of right haue amended mine euil life, and left my ſinnes, I heaped ſinnes vpon ſinnes. And theſe be the euils, wherewith I (whom thou didſt create after thine owne ſimilitude and likeneſſe) haue diſhonoured thee, O Lord, and haue ſpotted and defiled my ſelfe: namelie, with idolatrie, ſuperſtition, pride, vaine-glorie, couetouſneſſe, and other manie euils and foule vices, wherewith mine vnluckie ſoule is vexed, puniſhed, torne, and deſtroied.
                     Behold, O Lord, mine vnrighteouſneſſe is gone ouer mine head, and is like a ſore burden ouer heauie for me to beare: and except thou, whoſe propertie is euer to haue mercie, and to forgiue, doo laie vnder mee the right hand of thy Maieſtie: I ſhall be conſtrained miſerablie to ſinke into the deepe, and be drownd. Giue heed, O Lord God, and behold, bicauſe thou art holie:

looke how mine enimie aſſaulteth me, ſaieng; GOD hath forſaken him, I will perſecute him, and catch him, bicauſe there is no man that will deliuer him; but thou, Lord, how long? Turne againe and deliuer my ſoule, oh ſaue me for thy mercies ſake.
                     Haue mercie vpon thy daughter, whom thou haſt brought foorth with no ſmall ſorowe and paine, and bee not ſo intentiue vnto mine euilneſſe, that thou forget thine owne goodneſſe. What father is there, but hee will deliuer his child? Yea, and what father is there, that will not correct his child, and chaſten it? But with the rod of pitie. Therefore, O Father and Lord, although I be a ſinner, yet can I not chooſe but bee thy daughter, bicauſe thou haſt made me, yea and made me againe when I was mard with ſinne. Repaire and amend me now euermore, O Lord; but firſt of all, I being mended and chaſtiſed as thy child, with thy gentle ſcourge, deliuer me to thy Sonne.
                     Can a mother forget the child ſhe bare of hir womb? And ſurelie although ſhe ſometime be forgetfull, yet thou, O Father, haſt promiſed not to forget vs. Behold I crie, and thou dooeſt not heare me; I am vexed with ſorowe, and thou comforteſt me not. What ſhall I ſaie? Or what ſhall I doo moſt wretched caitife that I am? I being deſolate of ſo great comfort, am caſt out trō the ſight of thine eies. Wo be vnto me! From how great goodneſſe into how great a miſchiefe am I fallen? Whither purpoſed I to go? And whither am I come? Where am I? And where am I not? Whom did I labour to attaine vnto? And what euils haue I obteined? I ſought for good things, and behold I haue found trouble, anguiſh, & care. Behold now I am in a moſt miſerable caſe, euen in the ſtate of death and damnation. For Ieſus is not with me; my Ieſus is departed from me: and ſurelie it were better for me to haue nothing at all, yea no being at all, than to bee

without Ieſu. It is better not to liue, than to liue without life.
                     And thou, O Lord Ieſu, where be thine old mercies? Wilt thou abſent thy ſelfe for euer? Wilt thou bee angrie towards me a wretch for euermore? O be pacified I beſeech thee, and haue mercie vpon me! Be pacified I ſaie, and turne not thy face awaie from me, which to the intent thou mighteſt redeeme me, didſt not turne awaie thy face from them that rebuked thee, ſcorued thee, and ſpitted vpon thee. I confeſſe and acknowledge that I haue ſinned, and my conſcience deſerueth damnation, and the penance that I am able to doo, is not ſufficient to make amends for mine iniquitie: but ſure and certaine I am that thy mercie exceedeth all offences that a man can doo.
                     Oh doo not I be ſeech thee, moſt pitifull Lord, write my heinous ſinnes againſt me, that thou ſhouldeſt enter into iudgement with thy ſeruant; but according to the multitude of thy mercies now haue mercie vpon me, and croſſe and blot out all mine iniquities, before I depart hence, and ſhall be no more ſeene in this world. For elſe, wo be vnto me wretch that I am, when the daie of iudgement commeth, and the bookes of conſciences ſhall be laid wide open: when it ſhall be ſaid of me, Lo, looke vpon this woman and hir works, how wicked ſhe is, and abhominable they are. What ſhall I doo then, I ſaie, O Lord my God, when the heauens which I haue offended, ſhall reueale and ſhew foorth mine iniquitie; and the earth which I haue polluted, ſhall ariſe vp and teſtifie my manifold miſdeeds againſt me? Behold, I ſhall be able alas to giue neuer a word to anſwere, but to ſtand in thy preſence, trembling, quaking, vtterlie confounded, and holding downe my head for ſhame, as condemned alſo by the teſtimonie of mine owne giltie conſcience, vnto eternall damnation.
                     Alas wretch that I am, what ſhall I ſaie? I will

crie vnto thee O Lord my God. Why am I conſumed and fretted with holding my peace? But if I ſhould ſpeake, my greefe would not ceaſe: and if I hold my peace, I ſhall be moſt bitterlie vexed within. Go to therefore O my ſoule, moorne and lament as a widowe for hir huſband that ſhe had in hir virginitie. Howle wretch and crie out with weeping, becauſe thy ſpouſe Chriſt hath forſaken thee. O caitiffe crie alowd in the eares of thy God, and ſaie, O God almightie, let not thine anger fall vpon me. Deale not with me after my ſinnes, neither reward me after mine iniquities, becauſe that if thou laie ſo much to my charge as is due for my ſinnes, it is ſo much that I cannot receiue it; ſurelie Lord, my power is not able for to ſuffer or beare it.
                     Wherefore, O Lord, haue mercie vpon me, leaſt I deſpaire: but in deſpairing I will take hart to me, and be ſomewhat comforted. For although I haue committed ſo much, that thou maiſt condemne me woorthilie, yet thou haſt not loſt that, wherewith thou waſt woont to ſaue ſinners: neither dooeſt thou reioice at the deſtruction and loſſe of them that die. Yea to the intent that dead men might liue, thou thy ſelfe didſt die, and thy death did kill the death of ſinne: and if they were reuiued againe, and did liue by thy death, I beſeech thee let not me die now that thou liueſt. Send downe thy hand and power from high, and deliuer me out of the hands of mine enimies, that they reioice not ouer me and ſaie, Let vs deuoure him.
                     Who euer, O good Ieſu, needed to miſtruſt of thy mercie, which when we were thine enimies, didſt redeeme vs with thy bloud, and reconciled vs vnto God? Behold therefore, I being hid vnder the ſhadowe of thy mercie, doo come vnto the throne of thy glorie, requiring: and I doo runne crieng and knocking, vntill thou take pitie vpon me. For if thou didſt call vs to

pardon and forgiueneſſe before we laboured for pardon, how ſoone ſhall we obtaine forgiueneſſe when wee aſke it? Doo not remember, O moſt bountifull Ieſu, thy iuſtice towards a ſinner; but thinke vpon thy liberalitie and gentleneſſe toward thy creature. Doo not remember thine anger toward the giltie, but remember thy pitie and mercie toward a wretch. Forget me, in that I proudlie did prouoke and mooue thee vnto wrath, and looke vpon a wretch that calleth vpon thee. For what is Ieſus but a Sauiour? Therefore O good Ieſu, for thine owne ſake, ariſe and helpe me: and ſaie vnto my ſoule, I am thy health and thy ſafegard.
                     
                     Thus I preſume much, and am verie bold of thy goodneſſe, O Lord, becauſe thou dooeſt teach vs to aſke, to ſeeke, and to knocke: wherfore, I being admoniſhed by thy word, doo aſke, ſeeke, and knocke. And thou O Lord, that commandeſt vs to aſke, make mee able to receiue. Thou that giueſt counſell to ſeeke, grant that I may finde. Thou that teacheſt vs to knocke, open to me when I knocke, and confirme me which am vnſtable and wauering. Reſtore me that am loſt, raiſe me that am dead: and vouchſafe to direct and gouerne in thy fauour, all my ſenſes, my thoughts, and dooings, that from hencefoorth I may ſerue thee, I may liue toward thee, and that I may commit my ſelfe vnto thee. I knowe, O my Lord, that through this that thou haſt made me, I owe and am in debt vnto thee euen mine owne ſelfe: and becauſe thou haſt redeemed mee, and waſt made man for my ſake, for this I owe vnto thee more than my ſelfe. Lo, I haue no more, neither can I giue that which I haue vnto thee, without thee; but doo thou take me, and drawe me vnto thee, that I may be thine in following and louing thee, like as I am thine in condition and creation, which liueſt and reigneſt one God in bleſſed Trinitie, worlds without end,
                     Amen.
                  
                  
                     
                     The PSALTER, which S. AVGVSTINE compoſed out of euerie Pſalme of Dauid a verſe, for the vſe of his Mother.
                     
                     
                        O Lord God almightie, and king of eternall glorie, who dooeſt acknowledge him to be a bleſſed man, that abhorreth the waie of ſinners, and doth meditate in thy lawe daie and night.
                     Teach thou me a wretched ſinner, faithfullie to ſerue thee with feare and trembling of the heart.
                     And ſeeing with all humilitie of hart I doo call vnto thee with my voice, heare me, haue mercie vpon mee, and ſo harken vnto my praier, that neither thou for thy part rebuke me in thy wrath, nor that old enimie to mankinde, lieng in wait for his part to deuoure my ſoule like a Lion, and teare it in peeces while there is none to helpe.
                     But Lord, whoſe name is excellent in all the world, turne thou mine enimie backe, that he fall againe, and periſh at thy preſence.
                     Let him not intrap my ſoule with his firie ſnares, and ſuffer not brimſtone and ſtormie tempeſts to torment me.
                     But for the oppreſſion of the needie, and for the ſighings of the poore, now thou dooeſt ariſe; behold and heare me, O Lord my God, becauſe thou art the counſell and truſt of the poore.
                     Make me to walke vprightlie, and to worke righteouſneſſe, that thy fauourable kindneſſe may be the portion of mine inheritance.
                     Keepe me as the apple of thine eie. Hide me vnder

the ſhadowe of thy wings, becauſe thou art my ſtrength, my rocke, and my refuge.
                     Cleanſe me frō my ſecret faults, and keepe thy ſeruant from preſumptuous ſinnes.
                     Send me helpe from thy ſanctuarie, and giue mee mine harts deſire.
                     Saue me from the Lions mouth, and lead me in the paths of righteouſneſſe, that I may aſcend into thy mountaine, and ſtand in thine holie place, hauing innocent hands, and a pure hart.
                     Remember not the ſinnes of my youth, nor my rebellions.
                     Gather not my ſoule with the ſinners, neither giue me vnto the luſt of mine aduerſaries.
                     But ſo fauourablie harken thou vnto the voice of my petitions, that calling vpon the glorie of thine holie name, thou doo heare me, and haue mercie vpon me.
                     And ſo truſting in thee, let me neuer be confounded: but forgiue the puniſhment of my ſinne.
                     Let thy mercie, O Lord, be vpon me, as I truſt in thee, and deliuering me out of all my feare, ſaie vnto my ſoule, I am thy ſaluation.
                     And becauſe I truſt vnder the ſhadowe of thy wings, giue me mine harts deſire, and haſte thee to helpe mee, O my Lord, my ſaluation.
                     Lord, let me knowe mine end, and the meaſure of my daies what it is, let me knowe how long I haue to liue.
                     Incline vnto me, and heare my crie: bring me out of the lake of miſerie, out of the mirie claie, and ſet my feet vpon the rocke, and order my goings.
                     Deliuer me in the time of trouble, that I may go into thy glorious houſe: for thou art the God of my ſtrength.
                     Let not my ſteps go out of thy paths, that I may loue righteouſneſſe, and hate iniquitie.
                     
                        
Be thou mine hope and ſtrength: for thou art a great King ouer all the earth.
                     Thou which art a God for euer, deliuer my ſoule out of the power of hell: for it hath receiued thee.
                     And when thou ſhalt appeare to iudge vs, haue mercie vpon me, according to the multitude of thy mercies, and take not thine holie ſpirit from me.
                     O moſt gratious GOD, in that houre hide thy face from my ſinnes, and put awaie all mine iniquities.
                     Create in me a cleane hart, O God, renew a right ſpirit within me, that I may appeare like a greene oliue tree, in the houſe of my God, and there with Iacob reioice, and euerlaſtinglie be glad with Iſrael.
                     Saue me, O God, by thy name, and by thy power iudge mee.
                     Hide not thy ſelfe frō my ſupplication; but be mercifull vnto me.
                     Send thou from heauen, and ſaue me from the reproofe of them that would ſwalowe me vp.
                     Breake their teeth, O God, in their mouths: breake the iawes of the yoong lions, O Lord.
                     Thou art my defence, and my mercifull God.
                     Helpe me with thy right hand, and vnder the couering of thy wings let me be protected, when thou art to render euerie man according to his works.
                     While my ſoule thirſteth for thee, hide me from the conſpiracie of the wicked.
                     Sith all fleſh ſhall come vnto thee, put not backe thy mercie from me.
                     Neither take from me thine holie ſpirit; but cauſe thy face to ſhine vpon me.
                     Send me a good paſſage, O our God, which ſaueſt vs, that the deepe ſwallowe me not vp, nor the pit ſhut hir mouth vpon me.
                     Be thou mine helper and my deliuerer; O Lord,

make no tarieng.
                     Sith in thee, O Lord, I doo truſt; let me neuer bee confounded, when thou ſhalt iudge the people.
                     Lo, they which withdrawe themſelues from thee ſhall periſh. Oh let not me oppreſſed returne aſhamed!
                     Bicauſe thou art a righteous iudge, thou makeſt lowe, and thou exalteſt: and who ſhall ſtand in thy ſight when thou art angrie?
                     Thou art the God that dooeſt woonders.
                     As thou nouriſhedſt thy people with bread in ye wilderneſſe, and didſt not turne them from their luſt: ſo let thy grace refreſh me an hungrie ſoule; make haſte, and let thy tender mercies preuent me.
                     And thou my defender, giue me the bread of teares, and the bitterneſſe of a troubled mind, in the time of tribulation; and grant withall, that from the honie of the rocke, I may taſte the ſweetneſſe of inward conſolation.
                     O God, who iudgeſt betweene the innocent and the ſinners; who alone art the moſt high ouer all ye earth, haue mercie vpon me, and giue grace and glorie, who haſt ordeined a lawe.
                     Forgiue the iniquitie of mine hart; couer all my ſinnes, and ſaue thou thy ſeruant that truſteth in thee.
                     O God, who laieſt the foundations of thy Church vpon the holie mountaines, incline thine eare vnto my crie.
                     Let thine hand therefore eſtabliſh me, and turne me not vnto deſtruction; but deliuer me from the ſnare of the hunter, from the peſtilence, and from the plague that deſtroieth at noone daie: that being planted in thine houſe, I may flouriſh like a palme-tree, & growe like a Cedar in Libanon, bringing out fruit euen in mine old age; bicauſe holines becommeth thine houſe, O Lord, for euer.
                     Be thou my refuge, O my God, the rocke of mine

hope: for thou Lord art a great God, & a great King aboue all gods.
                     When thou wilt iudge the world with righteouſneſſe, and thy people in truth, I ſhall enioie light with the righteous, and ioie with the vpright in hart.
                     Let thy right hand, and thine holie arme preſerue mee.
                     Thou which ſitteſt vpon the Cherubims, make mee to come before thy preſence with ioifulneſſe, that I may walke in the vprightneſſe of mine hart in the midſt of mine houſe.
                     Let a froward hart depart from me, but cauſe mine eies to be turned vnto the faithfull, that I may ſit with them walking in a perfect waie, when through thy iudgement thou ſhalt cut off all the workers of wickedneſſe from the citie.
                     O Lord heare my praier, and let my crie come vnto thee.
                     Hide not thy face from me in the time of trouble: incline thine eares vnto me.
                     Pardon all my ſinnes, and redeeme my ſoule from deſtruction.
                     Satiſfie my longing with good things, thou which lookeſt vpon the earth, and it trembleth; and broughteſt foorth thy people with ioie, and thy choſen with gladneſſe.
                     Make me to keepe iudgment, and to worke righteouſneſſe at all times.
                     Bring me out of darkneſſe, and out of the ſhadowe of death, that with a prepared hart I may ſing and giue praiſe.
                     Saue me, O Lord, according to thy mercie, that in the glorie of Saints, in the aſſemblie and congregation of the iuſt, my righteouſneſſe may endure for euer, and mine horne be exalted with glorie.
                     That while thou raiſeſt the needie out of the duſt,

and lifteſt vp the poore out of the doong, making Iudah thy ſanctification, and Iſrael thy dominion, I may bleſſe thee, O Lord, from hencefoorth, and for euer: then ſhall I walke before the Lord in the land of the liuing.
                     Breake thou my bonds, and confirme thy mercie towards me: when I call vpon thee in my trouble, O Lord, heare me, and ſet me at large.
                     Teach me, O Lord, the waie of thy ſtatutes, that I may liue, and keepe it vnto the end.
                     Giue me vnderſtanding both to ſearch thy lawe, and to obſerue it alſo with mine whole hart.
                     I haue gone aſtraie like a loſt ſheepe: O ſeeke thy ſeruant, and deliuer my ſoule!
                     Preſerue my going out, and my comming in, that my feet may ſtand in the courts of Ieruſalem.
                     I lift vp mine eies vnto thee that dwelleſt in the heauens.
                     Deliuer my ſoule out of the ſnare of the foulers, leaſt I put foorth mine hands vnto wickedneſſe.
                     Fill my mouth with laughter, and my tongue with ioie: repleniſh my longing with good things, that thy beloued may find reſt, and bleſſe me out of Sion, that I may ſee the welth of Ieruſalem, hauing eſcaped the cords of wickedneſſe.
                     Let thine eares attend vnto the voice of my praiers, O Lord.
                     Let not mine hart be hautie, nor mine eies loftie; but giue me grace to thinke humblie, vntill I find a place for the Lord, an habitation for the mightie God of Iacob.
                     There the Lord hath appointed the bleſſing, and life for euer. There will I lift vp mine hands to thy ſanctuarie, and praiſe thee, who iudgeſt thy people, and art pacified towards thy ſeruants.
                     O God of gods, and Lord of lords, now weeping and worſhipping towards thine holie temple, trie me, and

knowe me, marke and conſider my paths, and leade me in thy waie for euer.
                     Deliuer me, O Lord, from the euill man, and preſerue me from the cruell man.
                     Let my praier be directed in thy ſight as incenſe.
                     Bring my ſoule out of priſon, that I may praiſe thy name.
                     Heare my praier, O Lord, in thy righteouſneſſe, and enter not into iudgement with thy ſeruant.
                     Heare me ſpeedilie, O Lord, leaſt my ſpirit faile me: for thou God art my refuge and my deliuerer.
                     And foraſmuch as thou art great, and moſt woorthie to be praiſed, and thy greatneſſe is incomprehenſible, raiſe vp the crooked, looſe the ſhackeled, and giue ſight to the blind, thou which dooeſt build vp Ieruſalem.
                     And when thou haſt made the barres of thy gates ſtrong, let me be coupled to thy children within.
                     As the Angels and all the powers in the kingdome of heauen doo praiſe thee, there let me triumphing gloriouſlie in the congregation of the Saints, with the ſounding Cimbals of my lips praiſe and magnifie thy name, the which is holie and glorious, and reigneth now and euerlaſtinglie,
                     Amen.
                  
                  
                     Shuſ-hanna hir Pſalter, conteining verie deuout praiers for remiſsion of ſinnes; for the auoiding of all kind of ſinne, and for the leading of a godlie life.
                     
                     
                        O Almightie and euerliuing GOD, thou God of al power, before whoſe eies all things be naked and bare: O Lord, thou great and terrible God, I ſaie, that keepeſt couenant & mercie with them that loue thee, and doo thy commandements; Let thine eares bee open, that thou

maiſt heare the praiers of thy ſeruant, which I make before thee at this time, and let them aſcend vp before thy preſence, and be accepted in thy ſight, for Ieſus Chriſts ſake.
                     Haue mercie vpon me thy poore creature, and worke of thine hands. For I haue ſinned, and done wickedlie, and haue offended thy Maieſtie greeuouſlie, in that I haue gone backe and departed from all thy precepts and iudgements, and haue not followed thy ſeruants the Prophets, that ſpake vnto me in thy name; but haue from daie to daie prouoked thy iuſt wrath and indignation againſt me.
                     O Lord, I acknowledge and confeſſe vnto thee my manifold ſinnes and wickedneſſe, the which I haue vnrighteouſlie & moſt greeuouſlie committed againſt thee in thought, word, and deed, from my youth vp vntill this daie: for the which I am now taught by thy word and grace to be hartilie ſorie, and doo vnfeinedlie repent, purpoſing euermore, through the aſſiſtance of thy grace, to walke in a new life. Deſiring thee for the pretious bloud-ſhedding of Ieſus Chriſt, thy deere Sonne our Lord, to haue mercie vpon me, and forgiue me all thoſe mine offences, according to thy great mercie and promiſe, which haſt ſaid; At what time ſo euer a ſinner dooth repent him of his ſinne from the bottome of his hart, I will put all his wickedneſſe out of my remembrance.
                     O Lord remember not therefore the multitude of my miſdeeds, I beſeech thee: but according to thy great mercies thinke vpon me.
                     Call to remembrance for Chriſts ſake thy louing kindneſſe, and thy tender mercie, the which hath euer beene of old.
                     Hide not thy face from me, nor caſt not off thy ſeruant in thy diſpleaſure.
                     For thy mercies ſake deliuer me from all my ſinnes,

and make me not a ſcorne vnto the fooliſh.
                     Turne not awaie thy mercie from me, but let thy moſt louing kindneſſe and truth alwaie preſerue me.
                     Helpe me for thy name ſake, and deliuer me in thy ſtrength.
                     Heare my praier, O Lord, and conſider the words of my mouth, for my miſdeeds preuaile againſt me: O bee thou mercifull vnto my ſinnes.
                     Let the ſorowfull ſighing of the priſoner come before thee, O Lord, and comfort the ſoule of thy ſeruant, for vnto thee doo I flie for ſuccour.
                     Satiſfie me with thy mercie, and that ſoone, ſo ſhall I reioice and be glad in thee all the daies of my life.
                     Looke not extreamlie what is done amiſſe in me, for I haue ſinned againſt heauen and before thee, and am no more woorthie to be called thy child: yet Lord, of thy great goodneſſe powre downe ſome of the crums that fall from thy childrens table, and make me as one of the leaſt of them.
                     Reward me not according to my deſeruings, for then I muſt needs periſh, for vnto me perteineth nothing but open ſhame, confuſion, and damnation, but with thee there is mercie, forgiueneſſe, and plentious redemption.
                     Therefore I come vnto thee, O Lord, thou louer of ſoules, not hoping in mine owne righteouſneſſe, but truſting onlie in the multitude of thy great mercies, which thou haſt made and laid foorth before the eies of all people, offering ſaluation to the whole world, and haſt promiſed, that whoſoeuer he or ſhe be of the whole generation of man, that will receiue grace, repent and turne vnfeignedlie from his ſinnes, ſhall haue free remiſſion and forgiueneſſe, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, which is our onelie aduocate and mediator, in whome our ſaluation lieth, and of whome thou haſt ſaid, This is my deere Sonne, in whome I am well

pleaſed and well pacified.
                     For this thy Sonnes ſake (by whome I am bold to come vnto thee, which appeareth now in thy ſight, making continuall interceſſion for vs) haue mercie vpon me, O thou mightie God: cleanſe me from all my ſinnes, and doo awaie all mine iniquities.
                     Oh let me feele thy mercies towards me, for I doo confeſſe my ſinnes vnto thee, O Lord, and hide not mine vnrighteouſneſſe. I doo acknowledge mine offences, and accuſe my ſelfe before thee of all my miſdeeds.
                     Helpe me, O God my ſauiour, for the glorie of thy name: O deliuer me, and forgiue me my ſinnes for thy rich mercies ſake.
                     Remember not the offences of my youth, O Lord, but thinke vpon thy great mercies and couenant made vnto me in Chriſt Ieſus.
                     For thy tender mercie ſake, laie not my ſinnes to my charge, but forgiue that is paſt, and giue me grace to amend my life, to decline from ſinne, and incline to vertue, that I may walke with an vpright hart, a cleane conſcience, and ſingle eie before thee this daie (or night) and euermore.
                     Put me not from thy preſence, oh thou God of all comfort, but incline thine eare vnto my calling.
                     Strengthen thy ſeruant with the power of thy right hand, and helpe thine handmaiden.
                     Comfort my ſoule with thy ſweet promiſes, and let thy mercies couer mine infirmities.
                     O moſt mercifull Father, conſider mine infirmities, I ſaie, which are manie and great, & beare with mine imperfection, for thy Sonne my ſauiour Ieſus Chriſtes ſake, which had good experience of our infirmitie, that he might be mercifull vnto all them that are afflicted.
                     Conſider the enimie hath gotten an open waie into my fleſh, wherein I confeſſe that there dwelleth nothing

but ſinne, wretchedneſſe, and miſerie. Yea O Lord, I acknowledge that I was borne in ſinne, and conceiued in wickedneſſe, and am by nature a child of wrath. For in my fleſh dwelleth no good thing, and of my ſelfe I am not able to thinke a good thought, much leſſe doo that thou in thy lawe requireſt of me to bee done, which haſt ſaid, Curſed is he that continueth not in all things that are written in the lawe to doo them. Againe, the lawe is ſpirituall, but I am carnall, ſold vnder ſinne.
                     Therefore O Lord my God, I call vnto thee for grace (which haſt ſaid, Aſke, and yee ſhall haue; ſeeke, and yee ſhall finde; knocke, and it ſhall bee opened vnto you) to preuent and drawe my will to all goodneſſe: for none can come vnto thee except he be drawne; and except we be borne from aboue, we cannot ſee the kingdome of God.
                     Aſſiſt me therefore, and guide me with thy holie ſpirit from time to time. Drawe me, and I ſhall runne after thee, and giue me ſtrength and ableneſſe through Chriſt our Lord, to accompliſh and fulfill thy righteous will, and to ſtand againſt all the aſſaults of the diuell, that they may haue no place in me, but that the old man which I beare about in my bodie, may be crucified, and dailie die in me; that the luſts of ſinne may vtterlie be deſtroied; that I may euermore be renewed in the ſpirit of my mind; and that the life of Chriſt may alwaies appeare in me.
                     Good Lord for thy great mercies ſake, deliuer me from all kinds of euill, namelie, from the ſpirit of pride, boaſting, vaine-glorie, hypocriſie, wantonneſſe, haughtineſſe of mind, preſumption, ſelfe-loue, and make mee poore in ſpirit, humble, meeke, gentle, and lowe in mine owne ſight; that I lift not vp my ſelfe aboue my brethren and ſiſters; but eſteeme my ſelfe to be as a ſeruant and hand-maiden to all men and women, to doo

them good, after the example of Chriſt, who came not to be miniſtred vnto, but to miniſter, who alſo hath ſaid, Bleſſed are the poore in ſpirit. Againe, Thou reſiſteth the proud, but giueſt grace to the humble.
                     Take from me my ſtonie, vnbeleeuing, blind, doubtfull, vnfaithfull, and vnthankefull hart; and giue me an hart of fleſh, to loue and incline to thy will; my carnall, ſecure, and impenitent hart take awaie from me, and giue me an hart to feare, loue, and obeie thee; write thy lawe in my hart; graue it in my mind, that I may beleeue, truſt, and liue in thee for euer.
                     Take from me the wicked ſpirit of ſuſpicion, enuie, hatred, variance, ſtrife, ſedition, ſects, euill gealouſie, vaine ſurmiſes, murmuring and grudging, backbiting or ſlandering of anie, eſpeciallie ſuch as be in authoritie, and miniſters of thy holie word.
                     O Lord keepe me from all wrath, malice, and haſtineſſe, all reſpect of perſons in the faith, all idolatrie, ſuperſtition, vanities, lieng, euill words, debate, contention, murther, theft, falſe-witneſſe-bearing, flattering, diſſimulation, hypocriſie, blaſphemie, and vaine ſwearing by the name of God, his works or creatures; from all lightneſſe, idle words, and all vnſtableneſſe of hart.
                     Oh Lord deliuer thou my hart from all ſurfeting, dronkenneſſe, gluttonie, and leacherie, and from all filthineſſe of the fleſh and ſpirit, from all vncleane thoughts, and vnlawfull deſires, euill concupiſcence, fornication, adulterie, and luſts of the bodie.
                     Take vtterlie from me alſo couetouſneſſe, and inordinate care of riches, all deceipt and guile, or dooing of wrong to anie in my calling and office: all idleneſſe, ſloth, and beaſtlie ſecuritie, and giue me not ouer vnto an vnſhamefaſt and obſtinate minde; but hold me alwaies vnto thy nourture and correction, and bow my hart alwaies vnto thee, that I may ſerue thee all the daies of my life, in ſuch holineſſe and righteouſnes, as

is acceptable before thee.
                     Giue me thy grace, oh Lord, that I may haue thee alwaies before mine eies; that I may alſo haue a reſpect vnto thy iudgements, that whatſoeuer I ſaie, thinke or doo, it may be agreeable to thy holie will and word: that I be not minded, as the vngodlie and wicked men and women are: let me haue no pleaſure in ſuch things as pleaſe them; and grant, that whenſoeuer I be ouertaken with anie kind of ſinne and wickedneſſe, either in thought, word, or deede, or that I feele mine owne infirmitie and weakeneſſe, I may immediatelie with hartie repentance returne to thee againe, and not to lie ſtill in the ſecuritie of ſinne.
                     Make me able and contented with patience to heare all occaſions of offence, when they be offered or giuen me, and not to recompenſe euill for euill, and ſuffer me not, good Lord, to giue occaſions of euill to anie man, and if I doo, make me willing to confeſſe my fault, and to amend it.
                     Giue me grace that I neuer enuie anie good mans loue or womans, becauſe they doo either loue God and his people more than I, or elſe that they be beloued of him or his more than I. Make me to reioice in other mens gifts, and not to enuie them, becauſe they be better than mine, but rather to giue thanks for them with all my hart, deſiring that they may be increaſed in them and in me.
                     Increaſe my faith, O Lord my ſauiour, in thee and in thy Chriſt, & make it ſtrong to beleeue thy promiſes.
                     Increaſe my loue, O my redeemer, to thee and to thy righteous people, and make it perfect, true, and vnfeined to all vertue and godlineſſe.
                     Increaſe a ſure hope in me of my ſaluation, O my iuſtifier, without doubt or wauering in aduerſitie, and without pride or preſumption in proſperitie, ſo that I may ſerue thee with reuerence and godlie feare all the

daies of my life.
                     Increaſe in me ſtrength to reſiſt ſinne, and to get the victorie and maſterie to ſtand againſt all euill temptations and aſſaults of the fleſh, the world, and the diuell, that they may haue no place in me, and that according to thy promiſe I be neuer further prooued nor tempted than thou wilt giue me ſtrength to ouercome.
                     Increaſe in me, O Lord, all other vertues agreeable to a godlie life: for I come vnto thee my God, as vnto the well and euerlaſting fountaine of all health and ſaluation.
                     Good Lord giue me grace therefore all the daies of this my pilgrimage, to walke with a good conſcience and pure mind both before thee, and towards all men in my dooing: that I be not a reader of thy holie word, and a talker onlie, but that it may appeare alſo in my life and conuerſation.
                     Regenerate my hart with the ſpirit of grace dailie more and more: giue me an inward taſte and feeling of thy fauour and mercie towards me in Chriſt Ieſu our Lord, that I may knowe thee to be my God and Father, and my ſelfe to be thy child for euermore.
                     Aſſiſt thy ſeruant againſt this world, with the vaine pompe, pleaſures, and beautie thereof, that it may be vnto me as vile duſt, filth and ſlime; that I may vſe it, as though I vſed it not, and that it may ſerue me, and I not it; that I may take my part thereof vnto my neceſſitie with thanks-giuing; that I doo not vſe thy creatures voluptuouſlie, but that I may liue ſoberlie and godlie in this preſent life to thy glorie.
                     Preſerue and defend thy ſeruant from all falſe opinions, that I be not deceiued and caried awaie in the errour of the wicked, but that I may growe in grace and knowledge of our Lord and ſauiour Ieſus Chriſt.
                     O Lord giue me wiſedome, knowledge, and vnderſtanding to perceiue thoſe falſe, lieng, and flattering

ſpirits, which doo deceiue the harts of innocents, and begile vnſtable ſoules.
                     Giue me alſo, O Lord, a right, a reuerent, and a pure iudgement and vnderſtanding of thy holie word, and to auoide all raſh iudgements, and peruerſe interpretations, that I may neuer ſwarue from the true ſenſe and meaning therof; and grant, that my cheefeſt felicitie may be in the ſame thy holie word, in hearing, reading, and talking of it, and in watching, praier, faſting, mortifieng mine owne will and members.
                     O Lord, plant in me true obedience to thy lawe, and let not the cares of this world choke thy word in me.
                     Make me to lift vp my hart oftentimes to thee, and if I chance to fall or ſlip, make me to thinke on thee, and to be ſorie with a ſtedfaſt purpoſe of amendment.
                     Oh Lord, I offer vp my ſelfe whollie with all my crooked and corrupt nature, ſo much as it is, in will and works, vnto thy mercie to be corrected, and reformed at thine owne will and pleaſure.
                     O let not the hand of the vngodlie caſt me downe, but ſaue my ſoule, O my Lord God, whither it bee through proſperitie or aduerſitie, loſſe or gaine, ſickeneſſe or health, life or death.
                     Aid, ſtrengthen, ſuccour and defend thy ſeruant in all aduerſities, tribulations, and temptations, and ſuffer me not to be tempted aboue my ſtrength.
                     Increaſe my ioie and comfort in thee and thy holie ſpirit, that I may reioice in all trouble and affliction, and imbrace the ſame to my conſolation and comfort, and thinke my ſelfe happie, when I am counted woorthie to ſuffer anie trouble for thy name ſake.
                     Take from mine hart the thoughts of earthlie comforts, onlie ſet before mine eies the ioie of the croſſe of Chriſt, that I may take comfort therein, and deſpiſe the ſhame, for the great reward that is laid vp in heauen for all thoſe, that with patience ſuffer in aduerſitie,

and continue in well-dooing vnto the end.
                     Oh Lord, take from me, I ſaie, a carefull hart in all worldlie things: let them be vile vnto me for thy ſake, and grant that neither pouertie oppreſſe me, and driue me to deſpaire or falſhood, neither wealth and proſperitie lift me vp to forget thee, or my ſelfe, but that in proſperitie I may be thankfull, and in aduerſitie patient and humble.
                     Lord, let me be merie without lightneſſe; ſad without miſtruſt; ſober without dulneſſe; fearing thee without deſperation; truſting in thee without preſumption: let me not be merie with the ioie that is without thee, and let me deſire nothing beſides thee.
                     Good Lord giue me ioifulneſſe of hart, and peace of conſcience, continuall gladneſſe and conſolation in thy word and promiſes, that I may euermore be thankfull vnto thee, and praiſe thy name for euer.
                     Let thy kingdome come vnto me, which is righteouſneſſe, peace, and ioie in the holie Ghoſt, long ſuffering, gentleneſſe, goodneſſe, faithfulneſſe, meekeneſſe, temperance, ſtrength, and patience, with all ſuch like vertues as are preſcribed vnto me in thy holie word.
                     Grant me, O God, a tender, louing, and mercifull hart towards my brethren, long amitie, and perfect patience, to beare all things well that thy prouidence ſhall ſee meet to laie vpon me.
                     Of thy fatherlie mercie, O God, leaue me not to my ſelfe; but ſtand thou alwaies by me. For I am too weake of mine owne power to doo anie thing that is good; but my righteouſneſſe and ſtrength lieth onelie in thee. Therefore, O Lord, I come vnto thee, requiring mercie in thy ſight, and the aſſiſtance of thy grace, that I may bee ſtrengthened with power in the inward man, and be armed at all aſſaies with thine holie complet armour, which is the breaſt-plate of righteouſneſſe; the ſheeld of faith; the hope of ſaluation for an

helmet, and the ſwoord of the ſpirit, which is thy holie word: that I may ſtand perfect in all that is thy will, and bee found woorthie through Chriſt to receiue a crowne of life, which thou haſt promiſed to all them that loue thee in pureneſſe of mind.
                     Now therefore, O Lord, I giue ouer my ſelfe into thine holie hands, deſiring thee for Chriſts ſake, that I thus armed may remaine vnder the protection and ſtrong defence of thy power, and that thine holie Angels may pitch their tents round about me, and compaſſe me alwaies.
                     And I beſeech thee, O Lord, giue vnto thy ſeruant the ſtrength of thine holie ſpirit to ſubdue this bodie of ſinne, with the whole luſts thereof, that it may bee made obedient, both in will, mind, and members, to doo thine holie will: that when thou ſhalt appeare to reward euerie one according to their deeds, I may reioice, and not be aſhamed of thee at thy comming.
                     Moreouer, O Lord, I beſeech thee thinke vpon all thy people, which are ſtraied here and there from the fartheſt part of the earth, which be entered into couenant with thee, and are minded to walke after thy will. Grant, O Lord, that we may growe togither in loue, through the knowledge of thy word: to keepe the vnitie of the ſpirit through the bond of peace, to the vtter confounding of errour, and all falſe opinions, and to keepe vs cleane from all hypocriſie and ſuperſtition, and to make vs ſtrong in all trouble and affliction.
                     O heauenlie Father grant vnto me and all other, I ſaie, whereſoeuer they be diſperſed throughout the vniuerſall world, which profeſſe thy holie word, ſo to liue, that we may die to ſinne, and lead a godlie conuerſation, walking innocentlie before thee.
                     Rule and confirme our harts with thy ſpirit, O Lord; lighten our minds, and guide vs alwaies with the lightſome lampe of thine holie Goſpell. Gouerne

and preſerue thy Church, and defend thoſe Realmes and Cities, that giue ſuccour and harbour to thy people: make vs all diligent and happie in the works of our vocation; take into thy cuſtodie for euer our ſoules and bodies, our liues, and all that euer we haue.
                     Be gratious and fauourable, oh Lord, to all men, and euen to our verie enimies, and according to thy good will and purpoſe, forgiue them their ſinnes: conuert vnto thy truth all thoſe, whom thou haſt appointed in Ieſus Chriſt to ſaluation.
                     Be mercifull, O God, to all our brethren and ſiſters, that ſuffer anie kind of perſecution or affliction, whether in mind or in bodie, eſpeciallie ſuch as ſuffer for thy name and Goſpell: giue them patience, conſtancie, and ſtedfaſt hope, till thou ſend them full and good deliuerance of all their troubles.
                     Be gratious to all thoſe, whom thou haſt coupled and linked to vs in loue and friendſhip, whoſe harts thou haſt mooued to praie for vs, to wiſh vs good, to ſuccour and helpe vs in our neceſſities: grant vs all thy bleſſing and holie ſpirit, to ſanctifie vs in the vnitie of faith, and dwell in vs for euer.
                     Finallie, oh Lord, haue mercie vpon mine huſband, children, and familie, which thou haſt giuen vs; make me to be content with him as thy gift, and increaſe thy feare in our harts, that we may trulie loue thee, and one another of vs in thee: ſo that we may be pure both in ſoule and bodie, and may godlie liue togither, according to thine holie ordinance.
                     Giue him an hart of wiſedome and vnderſtanding, and ſet thy feare alwaie before mine eies, that as Ioſeph caſt off all ſurmiſes of the miſ-behauiour of Marie his ſpouſe, and obeied the word of thine holie Angel; ſo he may beare with mine imperfections, and bee obedient in word, deed, and thought, to all that is thy will.
                     
                        
Oh Lord, giue vs the power of thy ſpirit to gouerne our ſelues holilie, and to rule and bring vp theſe our children and familie, in all godlie feare, nurture, information of the Lord, and knowledge of thy holie word, and that we may be alwaies vnto them an example in all godlineſſe and vertue, to the praiſe of thine holie name.
                     Plant in mine hart all vertues that be neceſſarie and requiſite in a Chriſtian woman, & giue mee grace ſo to vſe them, and all other good gifts, which I haue receiued at thy mercifull hands, as may be moſt to thy glorie and praiſe, to my conſolation and ſaluation, and to the profit of thy Church.
                     Behold Lord, although I am but duſt, earth, and aſhes; yet I haue taken vpon me, and am bold to come and make theſe petitions and requeſts vnto thee, not truſting in mine owne woorthineſſe or righteouſneſſe, which I doo acknowledge with the Prophet to be ſtained and defiled; but onlie in thy great mercie and promiſe, and through the merits of Chriſts death & bloud-ſhedding, to laie mine humble praiers before thee, requiring mercie, pardon, and forgiueneſſe of all my ſinnes, and alſo the aſſiſtance of thy grace, to doo thy will all the daies of my life, and to obteine all theſe my petitions.
                     O therefore heare me ſpeedilie, good Lord; forgiue me fauourablie, O Lord, and tarie not ouerlong; but for thine owne ſake doo it, and for thy deere Sonne Ieſus Chriſts ſake, in whom all thy promiſes are Yea and Amen, which is our onelie Redeemer, Mediator, Sauiour, and Iuſtifier; to whom with thee, O Father, and the holie Ghoſt, be all honour, glorie, and praiſe, now and euer,
                     Amen.
                  
                  
                     
                     Another good and godlie praier, to be ſaid at all times of euerie Christian, both man and woman.
                     
                        O Almightie, and euerlaſting GOD, Father, Sonne, and holie Ghoſt: thou that haſt made heauen and earth, and all things in them conteined; haue mercie vpon me poore wretched ſinner, dailie aſſaulted with all kind of miſerie and wretchedneſſe. I beſeech thee O Father, for the loue of thy Sonne Ieſus Chriſt, conſider my weakeneſſe, frailtie, and imperfection, and haue mercie vpon me. Increaſe thy graces in me, my ſouereigne Sauiour, my deere Redeemer, and mine onelie Iuſtifier. For I come vnto thee O Lord, according to the words of our Sauiour Chriſt, who hath ſaid; Come vnto me all ye that labour, and are laden, and I will eaſe and refreſh you. Oh moſt mercifull Father, eaſe me of and from the great burden of my ſinne, which I haue vnrighteouſlie committed againſt thee, either in thought, word, or deed; and refreſh my ſoule dailie with thy mercies. Sprinkle me with the ſweet hyſop of thy mercie, and then ſhall I be cleane: waſh me, and then ſhall I be whiter than ſnowe. Powre vpon me ioie and gladneſſe, and make my bones reioice which thou haſt ſmitten. Turne thy face from my ſinnes, and put out all my miſdeeds. Make me a cleane heart, O God, and renew a right ſpirit within me. Caſt me not awaie from thy preſence, and take not thy holie ſpirit from me. Oh giue me the comfort of thy helpe againe, and ſtabliſh me with thy free ſpirit. Then ſhall I teach thy waies vnto the wicked, that ſinners may be conuerted vnto thee. Deliuer me from bloud guiltineſſe, O God, thou that art the God of my health, that my tongue

may praiſe thy righteouſneſſe. Open my lips, O Lord, then ſhall my mouth ſhew foorth thy praiſe.
                     Conſider mine imperfection, and helpe it with thy mercies. Remember thine old woonted mercies, and faithfull promiſes made vnto our forefathers, Abraham, Iſaac, and Iacob, and all other Patriarchs, Prophets, Apoſtles, Martyrs, and other thy Saints, in our Sauiour Chriſt Ieſus, who being compaſſed with infirmitie, and weakeneſſe of the fleſh, came vnto thee, O Lord, as vnto the well and euerlaſting fountaine of their health and ſaluation, and thou mercifullie ſuſteinedſt them, keepedſt them, & deliueredſt them in all their temptations and tribulations. If their feet at anie time ſlipt, or went out of the waie, and committed ſinne againſt thee; yet thy mercie was alwaies readie, ſo that thou by thine holie ſpirit diddeſt procure them to repentance, ſo that they turned againe vnto thee; which conuerſion and turning againe thou mercifullie acceptedſt at their hands. For bicauſe they were deſirous to liue perfectlie in thy ſight, thou preſeruedſt them, ſo that they were found faithfull before thee.
                     O Lord, thou art the ſame, and thy yeeres endure for euer. I beſeech thee, O Father, beare mine imperfection, and helpe it likewiſe with thy mercie, if at anie time I happen to fall, and commit ſinne againſt thee, as thou ſaiedſt by thine holie Apoſtle Paule; Let thy grace at all time be ſufficient for me in ſuch wiſe, that I may immediatelie turne againe by true repentance vnto thee, which conuerſion and turning againe, accept alwaies at mine hands for Ieſus Chriſts ſake; ſo ſhall I be found perfect before thee. For although the ſpirit bee willing, yet is the fleſh vntoward and weake.
                     Therefore doo I not leaue mine owne righteouſneſſe before thee. For I knowe and confeſſe in me, that

is to ſaie, in my fleſh is nothing but plaine miſerie, wretchedneſſe and ſinne. Therefore doo I come vnto thee, and beſeech thee for Chriſtes ſake to extend thy mercifull hand towards me, and to doo awaie mine offences. For I knowe, O Lord, that all grace and goodneſſe commeth of thee, and therefore art thou praiſed, loued and feared in the congregation among the Saincts. For thou art onlie he that giueſt victorie, O Lord of hoſts, and that as thou ſaieſt by thy Prophet, neither through an hoſt of men, nor through ſtrength, but through thy ſpirit. Therefore, I beſeech thee, giue me not onlie ſtrength and knowledge of thee, but alſo a readie earneſt purpoſe and will to ſubdue mine imperfections, and grace at all times to liue as thou in thy holie word haſt preſcribed vnto me.
                     Moreouer I beſeech thee, make me perfect in thy ſight, that I may render continuall thanks by Ieſus Chriſt to thee. And where I haue not hitherto indeuored my ſelfe, according to that power, which thou haſt giuen me to liue after thy will, I praie thee forgiue me for Ieſus ſake. And now I proteſt before thee, through the helpe of the ſpirit, to order my life from hence foorth according to thy word, and to walke perfectlie before thee: neuertheleſſe I beſeech thee for Chriſtes ſake, at all times to beare the imperfections that ſhall or may at anie time be found in me, and deliuer me by thy power and mercie.
                     Increaſe my faith O my ſauiour; increaſe my faith O my iuſtifier; increaſe my faith O my redeemer; increaſe faith, hope, and charitie, and all other vertues in me, conſonant and agreeable to a godlie life. For I come vnto thee the well and euerlaſting fountaine of all health and ſaluation. O my heauenlie Father, let me and all other men and women liue in thy ſight, which ſeeke thy word, to the intent to forſake ſinne and all vngodlie liuing, and to walke in a godlie conuerſation

innocentlie before thee.
                     And I thanke thee, O Lord, with all my hart and mind, that it hath pleaſed thee of thy great mercie and goodneſſe to create and forme me of the mould of the earth, and giuen me all my members requiſite and needfull to the bodie, and that it hath pleaſed thee to preſerue all that which thou haſt created in me, ſith the time of the creation vntill now, and that it hath pleaſed thee to defend me this daie (or night) and all the daies and time of my life hitherto, from all hurt and perils, and deliuered me from the hour of temptation and tribulation, as well when I was aſleepe and forgetfull, as when I remembred and called vpon thee. And that it hath pleaſed thee to miniſter to my neceſſitie, meate, drinke, and cloathing, inward reioicing, quietneſſe of mind, health of bodie, and ſuch like, and that it hath pleaſed thee to giue me this man, and my brother in profeſſion T. B. to be my huſband, vaile, remedie, conſolation, and comfort in my neceſſities. Grant me grace in him, O Lord, trulie to honor, loue, ſerue, and obeie thee: for I knowe, whatſoeuer I doo to him, be it good or euill, it ſhall be rewarded of thee. Lighten vs dailie with thy grace, that we may gouerne our ſelues, the houſhold and children which thou haſt giuen vs, in the true faith, feare and knowledge of thee, ſo that it may be an acceptable ſacrifice vnto thee by Ieſus Chriſt our Lord.
                     And ſeeing it hath pleaſed thee O Father, to lighten the inward eies of my mind with thy grace, and to call me from the great blindneſſe of ignorance and ſinne, wherein all men are borne, to the knowledge of thee; let it now more (as S. Paule ſaith) pleaſe thee to preſerue me and all other whome thou haſt called, which are dailie oppreſſed by ſinne, which deſire to turne, and to come vnto thee, of what tongue or nation ſoeuer they be through the whole world.
                     
                        
And ſeeing it hath pleaſed thee to call me by grace to the knowledge of thy word, & giuen me a will to ſeeke it, to loue, and beleeue it: let it be thy will to direct my waies, that I erre not. Oh ſtaie my feet with thy holie hand, and preſerue me with thine arme, for I am elſe farre too weake, without thee I can doo nothing.
                     Oh let me liue in thy ſight, O Lord, and put me not from thee, but giue me a new hart, and a new ſpirit, yea a pure mind, and a cleane conſcience make thou in me, then ſhall I be perfect before thee. Then ſhall I call vpon thee in time of my trouble, and offer acceptable ſacrifice vnto thee by Ieſus Chriſt, euen the fruit of theſe lips, which confeſſe thy name, and patientlie receiue the cup of health at thy hand; and call vpon thy name in time of aduerſitie.
                     Oh heare my praier, I beſeech thee: let my power and pleaſure alwaie be in the tree of life, and in the fruit thereof, which ſtandeth in the midſt of the Paradiſe of God. O accept this voluntarie ſacrifice at my hand, as the ſweet ſmell of incenſe, and let the lifting vp of my hart with my hands be an euening ſacrifice, pleaſant and acceptable vnto thee, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, to whome be euerlaſting praiſe, honor and glorie now and euer,
                     Amen.
                  
                  
                     Another Chriſtian praier for grace and remiſſion, to be dailie vſed.
                     
                     
                        O Moſt mightie God, mercifull and louing Father, I wretched ſinner come vnto thee in the name of thy deerelie beloued ſonne Ieſus Chriſt my onlie ſauiour and redeemer, and moſt humblie beſeech thee for his ſake, to be mercifull vnto me, and to caſt all my ſinnes out of thy ſight and remembrance, through the merits of his bloudie

death and paſſion.
                     Powre vpon me, O Lord, thy holie ſpirit of wiſedome and grace. Gouerne and leade me by thy holie word, that it may be a lampe vnto my feet, & a light vnto my ſteps. Shew thy mercie vpon me, & ſo lighten the naturall blindneſſe and darkneſſe of my hart through thy grace, that I may dailie be renewed by the ſame ſpirit & grace: by the which, O Lord, purge the groſeneſſe of my hearing & vnderſtanding, that I may profitablie reade, heare, & vnderſtand thy word & heauenlie will, beleeue and practiſe the ſame in my life & conuerſation, & euermore hold faſt yt bleſſed hope of euerlaſting life.
                     Mortifie and kill all vice in me, that my life may expreſſe my faith in thee. Mercifullie heare the humble ſuite of thy ſeruant, and grant me thy peace all my daies. Gratiouſlie pardon mine infirmities, and defend me in all dangers of bodie, goods and name, but moſt chieflie my ſoule, againſt all aſſaults, temptations, accuſations, ſubtill baites, and ſleights of that old enimie of mankind Sathan, that roring Lion, euer ſeeking whome he may deuoure.
                     And heere, O Lord, I proſtrate with moſt humble mind craue of thy diuine Maieſtie, to be mercifull vnto the vniuerſall Church of thy Sonne Chriſt. And eſpeciallie, according to my bounden dutie, I beſeech thee for his ſake to bleſſe, ſaue, & defend the principall member thereof, thy ſeruant, our moſt deere and ſouereigne Ladie Queene Elizabeth: increaſe in hir roiall heart true faith, godlie zeale, and loue of the ſame, and grant her victorie ouer all hir enimies, a long, proſperous, and honourable life vpon earth, a bleſſed end, and life euerlaſting.
                     Moreouer, O Lord, grant vnto hir Maieſties moſt honourable Counſellers, and euerie other member of this thy Church of England, that they & we in our ſeuerall callings, may trulie and godlie ſerue thee. Plant

in our harts true feare and honor of thy name, obedience to our Prince, and loue to our neighbours. Increaſe in vs true faith and religion. Repleniſh our minds with all goodnes, and of thy great mercie keepe vs in the ſame till the end of our liues. Giue vnto vs a godlie zeale in praier, true humilitie in proſperitie, perfect patience in aduerſitie, and continuall ioie in the holie Ghoſt.
                     And laſtlie, I commend vnto thy fatherlie protection all that thou haſt giuen me, as huſband, children, and ſeruants. Aid me, O Lord, that I may gouerne, nouriſh, and bring them vp in thy feare and ſeruice. And foraſmuch as in this world I muſt alwaies be at warre and ſtrife, not with one ſort of enimies, but with an infinite number; not onelie with fleſh and bloud, but with the diuell, which is the prince of darkeneſſe, and with wicked men executors of his moſt damnable will: grant me therefore thy grace, that being armed with thy defence, I may ſtand in this battell with an inuincible conſtancie againſt all corruption, which I am compaſſed with on euerie ſide, vntill ſuch time as I hauing ended the combate, which during this life I muſt ſuſteine, in the end I may atteine to thy heauenlie reſt, which is prepared for me, and all thine elect, through Chriſt our Lord and onlie ſauiour,
                     Amen.
                  
                  
                     Another praier for mortification and holineſſe.
                     
                     
                        O Lord our God, moſt gratious and moſt mercifull, I doo acknowledge before thee that I am vnwoorthie to appeare before thy high Maieſtie, to offer vp vnto thee a ſacrifice of praier, being full of ſinne and corruption, naturallie glad of euill, and vnprofitable to good: yea, beeing ſo

miſerable, that I ſee not my miſerie, I feele it not, I bewaile it not as I ought to doo, but multiplie mine iniquities, prouoking thy iuſt iudgement againſt me. My zeale is cold, my loue feeble, my exerciſes of religion faint and few, and I take no waie but that which leadeth from euill to worſſe, and finallie, would leade me from ſinne, to the reward of ſinne. All this is true, deere Father, yet my hart is not moued with feare; all this true, yet I doo not ſorowe for it, but walke with ioie, where I muſt (if I continue) reape affliction. Therefore, be mercifull vnto me, and bleſſe me: be mercifull vnto me, and in Chriſt Ieſus waſh awaie all mine iniquities: be mercifull vnto me, and create in me a new hart, and prepare it to praier, and to thy holie ſeruice. For thou alone, O Lord, art my hope, and the mightie God of my ſaluation. Thou haſt giuen me a deſire to ſerue thee, O teach me that I may doo it! and the good worke which thou haſt begun, make it perfect in me, that I may no more loue goodneſſe, and yet followe vanitie; but that my good deſires in thee may be increaſed, and all of them accompliſhed, ſo ſhall I praiſe thee, and magnifie thee for euer. For there is no honour but thy honour; no glorie but thy glorie, O Lord. It is in vaine to truſt in princes, but trulie to truſt in the Lord, bringeth plentifull ſaluation. From age to age it hath appeared, that thou O Lord God art mercifull, and that in thy courts there is nothing but truth and holineſſe. This world is full of vanitie, full of pride, full of rebellion, and the fleſh alſo. The world hath manie baits to deſtruction, and the fleſh doth delight in them, they are ſworne togither to betraie vs to Sathan, yea we betraie our ſelues. Therfore, deere Father, by the croſſe of Chriſt, mortifie in vs the deeds of the fleſh, and crucifie both vs to the world, and the world to vs, that our ſoules may liue.
                     In our generall calling make vs obedient to ſerue

thee in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe all the daies of our life: in our particular callings alſo make vs faithfull, that we may neither put awaie a good conſcience, nor make ſhipwracke of faith. I beleeue; O Lord, helpe mine vnbeleefe. In the daie of peace and proſperitie make vs ſober; in the daie of trouble and aduerſitie make vs to looke vp, and cheerfullie to wait and truſt in thee for our deliuerance, that our enimies mouthes may be ſtopped by our godlie conuerſation, and their harts pricked with zeale to turne vnto thee.
                     Neither doo I praie, O Lord, for my ſelfe alone, but for the whole bodie, vnto the which I am ingraffed by Chriſt Ieſus; that is, for thy Church, O God; for thine inheritance, that thou wouldeſt increaſe it from one end of the world to another, that all nations may worſhip before thy footſtoole. Eſpeciallie, O Lord, I praie for them that profeſſe thy Goſpell: as for this our nation, that thou wouldeſt be mercifull vnto it, turning our harts to thee; for our gratious Souereigne the Queene, and for all hir Counſell, that thou wouldeſt powre thy graces vpon them, to the diſcharge of their dutie, and our peace: for all the holie teachers of thy Church, that thou wouldeſt bleſſe them and their labours; for the peace and full beautie of this Church; for the peace and wealth of the Commonwealth. We praie thee alſo for to bleſſe the meanes to bring this to paſſe: alſo we praie thee for our parents; for all others to whom we owe eſpeciall loue or ſeruice; but principallie we beſeech thee, to ſhew thy compaſſion vpon all that are in perſecution for thy Goſpell: O Lord, increaſe and renew their ſtrength, giue them victorie, and turne their aduerſaries harts, if they apperteine to thine holie election; otherwiſe, O Lord, bring vpon them the cōfuſion, that they would bring vpon others; and into the pit that they haue digged, let them fall, and neuer riſe vp againe. O Lord, heare vs in theſe

ſuits, pardon our dull ſpirits in praier, and giue vs theſe and all other graces needfull for vs, and thy Church, to thy glorie, for our Lord Ieſus Chriſts ſake, in whoſe name, as he hath taught vs, ſo we praie, ſaieng: Our Father, &c.
                     
                     After that, you may ad anie morning or euening praier.
                  
                  
                     Another verie deuout praier for grace and mercie.
                     
                     
                        O Lord God almightie, three in perſons, yet but one GOD, who both art in all, and waſt before all, and wilt be in all things, a bleſſed God for euermore. Now and alwaies into thine hands I doo commend, both my ſoule, my bodie, my ſight, hearing, taſting, ſmelling, and feeling, with all my cogitations, affections, actions, outward and inward things, my ſenſe, and vnderſtanding, my memorie, my faith and beleefe, and perſeuerance, that thou maieſt keepe them daie and night, euerie houre and moment.
                     O ſacred Trinitie heare my petition, and ſaue mee from all euill, from offending, and from ſinning anie maner of waie; from all ſnares and purſuits of Sathan, and of enimies viſible and inuiſible. Expell farre from me the hautineſſe of mind, and increaſe within me the ſorowe of hart; diminiſh my pride, and eſtabliſh true humilitie within my breaſt; fetch teares from mine eies, mollifie mine hard and ſtonie hart, and ſaue Lord both me and my ſoule from all traps of the enimie, and continue me in thy pleaſure. Teach mee to doo thy will: for thou art my God. Giue me perfect ſenſe and vnderſtanding, O Lord, that I may be able to conceiue the deepneſſe of thy mercie. Grant me grace

to beg that at thy hands, which may both be ioifull for thee to grant, and behoofull for me to receiue. Make me vnfeinedlie to be waile my ſinnes, and manifold offences. Heare O my Lord and my God; heare O light of mine eies; heare my petition, and grant, that what I requeſt, I may obtaine. If thou deſpiſeſt me, I am vtterly vndone; if thou heareſt me I take hart againe; if thou examineſt my righteouſneſſe, lo, I ſtinke like a dead carion: but if in mercie thou reſpect me, thou raiſeſt him that ſtinketh out of the graue. What thou hateſt in me, remooue farre from me, and ingraffe the ſpirit of chaſtitie, and of a cleane life in my mind, that in aſking anie thing at thine hands, I may not offend thee in aſking the ſame. Take from me whatſoeuer is hurtfull to my ſoule, and giue whatſoeuer is behoofull. O Lord, giue me a ſalue to heale my greeuous wounds.
                     Indue me, good Lord, with thy feare, with ſorowe of hart, with humilitie of mind, and with a pure conſcience. Giue me grace, Lord, to keepe brotherlie concord euermore; to remember my tranſgreſſions; not to meddle with the dealing of other men or women. Pardon my ſoule; pardon my ſinnes; my wickedneſſe pardon; O pardon mine offences: viſit me that am weake; cure me that am ſicke; heale me that doo languiſh, and raiſe me, which am dead. O Lord, giue me both an hart to dread thee; a mind to loue thee; ſenſe to knowe thee, eares to heare thee; eies to ſee thee. Haue mercie on me, O God, haue mercie on me; looke vpon me from the holie ſeat of thy Maieſtie, and illuminate the darkneſſe of mine hart with the beames of thy brightneſſe. Giue me wiſedome, O Lord, to diſcerne betweene good and euill, and grant me a watchfull vnderſtanding. Forgiue all my ſinnes, I beſeech thee, and in this time of neceſſitie and trouble, be thou good and gratious to me, I onlie beſeech thee. After thy woonted mercie, and

moſt louing kindneſſe, O Lord, I beſeech thee vouchſafe to giue me the life, which euer ſhall endure.
                     O Lord Ieſus Chriſt, giue both to thy miniſters vnitie of mind, and to magiſtrates iudging vprightlie, peace and tranquillitie. Furthermore, O Lord, my requeſt is for the whole catholike and holie Church; for men and women; for religious, and for ſecular men; for all Chriſtian gouernours and people beleeuing in thy name, which labour for thine holie loue, that they may haue grace to continue in well-dooing. O Lord, eternall King, giue to virgins, chaſtitie; to the vnmaried, continencie; to the wedded, puritie; to repenters, mercie; to widowes and orphans; comfort; to the poore, protection; to trauellers, a ſafe returne; to mourners, conſolation; to ſea-faring men, a ioifull hauen; to the good, zeale to perſiſt, to the well inclined, a mind to prooue better; to the wicked and ſinfull, as to me a wretch and chiefe of ſinners, grace with ſpeed to repent.
                     O ſooeete Lord, and moſt mercifull Ieſus Chriſt, Sonne of the liuing God, redeemer of the world: I acknowledge that among all, and aboue all ſinners, I am moſt wretched; but thou moſt gratious, and high Father, who takeſt mercie vpon all, canſt not ſuffer me to be vtterlie deſtitute of thy mercie. O thou Lord, King of kings, who granteſt truce of life, ſtir in mee a mind alwaie, and aboue all things to ſeeke, to deſire, to loue, to feare thee, and to doo thy will, who art euerie-where all whole, a Trinitie, and but one God. Eſpeciallie, O Lord holie Father, who art bleſſed and glorious for euermore, I beſeech thee in moſt humble ſort, vouchſafe to gouerne and keepe them from deſtruction, who either doo make mention of me in their praiers, or haue commended themſelues to mine vnwoorthie ſupplications, or haue done good, whether it bee vnto my bodie with temporall benefits, or to my ſoule

with profitable inſtructions; or be linked vnto me either in kindred, friendſhip, or good-will. Furthermore, both for all Chriſtians, which are aliue, I praie thee ſtand thou at their elbowe to aſſiſt them: and for ſuch alſo as are dead, and euerlaſtinglie doo reſt from their labours, I yeeld thee immortall praiſe. Finallie, this one thing more grant me, O Lord, I doo earneſtlie beſeech thee, who art Alpha and Omega, that when the vttermoſt daie and end of my life ſhall come, thou wilt be a mercifull iudge to me, againſt that malicious accuſer the diuell, and that thou wilt continuallie protect me againſt the ſnares of the old Serpent; and finallie conduct me into the ſocietie of Angels, and of all Saints in thine holie paradiſe, who art bleſſed now and euermore,
                     Amen.
                  
                  
                     Another praier for grace and newneſſe of life.
                     
                     
                        O Lord my God, giue me grace from the verie bottome of mine hart to deſire thee; in deſiring to ſeeke thee; in ſeeking to find thee; in finding to loue thee; in louing vtterlie to loath my former wickedneſſe. O Lord my GOD, giue I beſeech thee, to mine hart repentance; to my ſpirit contrition; to mine eies a fountaine of teares; to mine hands liberalitie vnto the poore. O my King, quench in me the deſires of the fleſh, and inflame within my breaſt the fire of thy loue. Driue awaie from me the ſpirit of pride, O my redeemer, and of thy mercie beſtowe vpon me the treaſure of thine humilitie. O my Sauiour, remooue from my mind the rage of wrath, and gratiouſlie giue me the ſheeld of patience. Plucke euen from the verie roote of mine hart the rancor of malice, O my Creator; and make me to enioie the

ſweetneſſe of a quiet mind. Giue me, O moſt louing Father, a ſound faith, a right hope, and a conſtant loue.
                     O my gouernour, driue awaie farre from me all vanitie, and ſuffer me to haue neither an vnconſtant, nor a wandering hart; nor a ſcurrilous mouth; nor a proud looke; nor a greedie bellie; nor a ſlandering tongue; nor itching eares after curioſitie; nor a couetous mind after riches; nor polling hands to abuſe my power; nor ambitious motions to get vaine glorie: let both curſed hypocriſie, and poiſoned flatterie, and proud contempt of the poore, and violent oppreſſion of the weake; let both burning couetouſneſſe, and cankered enuie, with damnable blaſpheming of thy name be alwaies farre from me thy ſeruant. O my maker, make a large diſtance betweene me and raſhneſſe; betweene me and wickedneſſe; betweene me and frowardneſſe; betweene me and vnquietneſſe; betweene me and idleneſſe; betweene me and drowſineſſe; betweene me and blockiſhneſſe. Grant that mine hart prooue not blind; my ſenſes obſtinate; my maners ſauage: but let me delight in goodneſſe, and followe counſell, and neuer looſe the bridle to my tongue; nor cruellie make a praie of the poore; nor violentlie oppreſſe the weake; nor vniuſtlie ſlander the innocent; nor negligentlie regard inferiours committed to my charge. Finallie, let mee vſe neither crueltie towards my ſeruants, nor treacherie towards my friends, nor violence vpon my neighbours.
                     O my God, my mercifull God, euen through thy beloued Sonne, I beſeech thee giue me grace to exerciſe my ſelfe in the works of mercie, and in godlie cogitations; namelie, to weepe with them that weepe; to inſtruct ſuch as go aſtraie; to helpe the afflicted; to cheriſh the poore; to comfort the ſorowfull; to releeue the oppreſſed; to nouriſh the hungrie; to refreſh them which mourne; to forgiue my debters, to pardon them

which haue hurt me; to loue them which hate me; to render for euill good; to deſpiſe none, but to honor all; to imitate the vertuous; to ſhun the wicked; to embrace vertue; to flee ſinne: in aduerſitie to be patient, in proſperitie to be continent: to ſet a watch before my mouth, and a ſeale of wiſedome before my lips: to deſpiſe earthlie, and to couet after heauenlie things.
                     Thus, my maker, I haue aſked much, and yet haue deſerued naught, I confeſſe; yet alas I confeſſe that not onlie I deſerue not thoſe bleſſings which I doo require, but alſo doo deſerue manie & exquiſit torments: notwithſtanding euen publicans, harlots, & theeues, who in a moment pluckt from out the iawes of the enimie, are taken into the armes of the ſhepheard, doo embolden me to doo as I doo. Wherefore haue mercie vpon me, O good Lord I beſeech thee, and vouchſafe fauourablie to heare me, and grant my requeſts, So be it.
                     
                  
                  
                     A praier called, ô bone Ieſu: neceſſarie to be ſaid at all times for mercie and grace.
                     
                     
                        O Bountifull Lord Ieſu Chriſt, O ſweet Sauiour, O Chriſt the ſonne of God, haue pitie vpon me, mercifullie heare me, and deſpiſe not my praiers. Thou haſt created me of nothing: thou haſt redeemed mee from the bondage of ſinne, death, and hell, neither with gold nor ſiluer, but with thy moſt pretious bodie once offered vpon the croſſe, and thine owne bloud ſhed once for all for my ranſome. Therefore caſt me not awaie, whome thou by thy great wiſedome haſt made; deſpiſe me not, whome thou haſt redeemed with ſuch a pretious treaſure, nor let my wickedneſſe deſtroie that which thy goodneſſe hath builded. Now whileſt I liue, O Ieſu, haue mercie vpon me. For if I die out of thy fauour, it

will be too late afterward to call for thy mercie. Whileſt I haue time to repent, looke vpon me with thy mercifull eies, as thou didſt vouchſafe to looke vpon Peter thine Apoſtle, that I may bewaile my ſinfull life, and obteine thy fauour to liue and die therein.
                     I acknowledge, that if thou ſhouldeſt deale with me according to thy iuſtice, I haue deſerued euerlaſting death: therefore I appeale to thy high throne of mercie, truſting to obteine thy fauour, not for my merits, but for thy merits, O Ieſu, who haſt giuen thy ſelfe an acceptable ſacrifice to the Father, to appeaſe his wrath, and to bring all ſinners trulie repenting and amending their euill life, into his fauour againe. Accept me, O Lord, among the number of them, whome thou haſt in Chriſt elected and choſen to ſaluation: forgiue my ſinnes, giue me grace to leade a godlie and innocent life: grant me the heauenlie wiſedome, inſpire my hart with faith, hope, and charitie: giue me grace to be humble in proſperitie, patient in aduerſitie, obedient to my rulers, faithfull vnto them that truſt me, dealing trulie with all men, to liue chaſtlie in wedlocke (or in this my ſingle life) to abhorre adulterie, fornication, and all vncleanneſſe: to doo good after my power vnto all men, to hurt no man, that thy name may be glorified in me during this preſent life, and that I afterward may atteine euerlaſting life, through thy mercie, and the merits of thy pretious death and paſſion,
                     Amen.
                  
                  
                     A forme of praier, conteining a paraphraſis of theſe words of Dauid in his 119. Pſalme: Order my ſteps in thy word, and ſo ſhall no wickedneſſe haue dominion ouer me.
                     
                        O Eternall God, Father of our Lord Ieſu Chriſt, which with thine onlie begotten Sonne, and the holie Ghoſt, art the maker, preſeruer, and

helper of all creatures. Upon thee doo I call, in the name of Chriſt the Mediator. Helpe and gouerne mee with thy holie ſpirit, that with a ſtedfaſt purpoſe I may conſtantlie cleane vnto thy word: that my ſteps, my thoughts, intents, purpoſes, actions, and all the courſe of my life, may be directed & made conformable to thy commandements and promiſes, and that I may euer haue thy word before mine eies, to followe it as the onlie and moſt infallible rule of my life, and lightſome lampe to my feet.
                     
                        Order my ſteps in thy word, that I may feare in my hart thy great wrath and threatnings againſt ſinne, and quake and tremble at the dreadfull examples of puniſhments, which therefore from the beginning, thou haſt publiſhed in the world againſt all the wicked and vngodlie ones, that haue and doo contemne thy word, and that I may acknowledge thoſe puniſhments to be forewarnings of thy iudgements to come, in the which this moſt dreadfull ſentence ſhall be pronounced againſt all the vngodlie, Go yee curſed into euerlaſting fire.
                     
                     
                        Order my ſteps in thy word, that in true feare and awe of thy Maieſtie, I may tame my mind, bridle my luſts, keepe vnder mine affections, rule mine imaginations, reſtraine my thoughts, repreſſe and ſtop all vicious motions, ſhun all wickedneſſe, and kill the life of ſinne in me.
                     
                        Order my ſteps in thy word, that in frights and feares, in terrors and temptations, in all aſtoniſhments, troubles, afflictions, diſtreſſes and dangers bodilie or ghoſtlie, with fixed eie and firme faith, I may behold & looke vpon thy grace and mercie, which for thy ſonne our Lord Ieſus Chriſtes ſake is ſhewed and declared vnto vs in thy Goſpell; and neuer ſeeke thy will anie where elſe but in thy word, and ſurelie perſuade my ſelfe that trulie to be thy will, which in thy word and

promiſes is reuealed and ſet foorth. Helpe me alſo, O God, I beſeech thee, that in all mine agonies & feares, I may cheere and raiſe vp my ſelfe with the heauenlie comfort of thy word, and ſo with a conſtant faith in thy mercifull promiſes that I find there, I may repoſe my truſt, and quiet my conſcience in Chriſt my mercifull Mediator, aſſuring my ſelfe vndoubtedlie that for his ſake I ſhall be both heard, receiued, helped, deliuered, and ſaued.
                     
                        Order my ſteps in thy word, that in all this ſhort courſe of my life I may be obedient vnto thee, and ſerue thee faithfullie and diligentlie in my vocation: that I may keepe my ſelfe within the limits of my charge, and ſerue thee trulie in thoſe works which thou requireſt of me in my ſeuerall calling.
                     
                        Order my ſteps in thy word, that this knowledge of thy word in me be firme, conſtant, certaine, immoueable, and vnchangeable, that my mind wauer not, nor wander to and fro, neither be caried hither and thither inconſtantlie with euerie blaſt of opinions.
                     
                        Order my ſteps in thy word, that in the race & courſe of this life, there be no obſtacles, lets, or vaine ſtrife and contention betweene fleſh and bloud, to burſt the bonds of my vocation; but let it be conſtant, healthfull, happie and proſperous to the end, and helpe me therein, that I may perſeuere in a right courſe, and win the goale; and make me an inſtrument and veſſell of mercie, caring and miniſtring healthfull and good things both to my ſelfe and to others, that I may be comforted in this thy promiſe, which ſaiedſt, Thy labour ſhall not be in vaine in the Lord, and all that thou dooeſt ſhall proſper.
                     
                     But alas, ſinne dwelling and ſticking in this our corrupt nature, doth too too much trouble, and hinder our ſteps. Our vntamed luſts, vncomlie affections, and inordinate deſires, euen like furious mad men, doo

ſolicit vs, vexe, diſquiet, and torment vs, and quite drawe, driue, and carrie our ſteps foorth of the true waie, which thy word ſheweth, into the by-paths, and ſtrange waies that are moſt perillous, dangerous, pernicious, and leade to deſtruction, Yea alas (ſuch is the miſerie of our corrupt nature) that ſinne, a thing moſt horrible and deteſtable, doth ſmile vpon vs, and is become verie delightfull and pleaſant vnto vs, and moſt willinglie and gladlie we obeie, and are readie to followe the flickering intiſements and vaine allurements of all manner of vices. Yea ſo great and lamentable is the weakeneſſe and imbecillitie of our nature thus corrupted, that quicklie and eaſilie we ſuffer our ſelues continuallie to be more and more remooued, driuen backe, and diſtracted from the right waie that leadeth to thee.
                     
                        Order my ſteps therefore in thy word, O Lord I beſeech thee, and ſo rule, direct, gouerne & helpe me, that ſinne neither dwell in me, nor haue dominion ouer me in action nor to damnation. O let not ſinne reigne in mee, I ſaie, to action, as it did in Dauid, by forcing me to follow the ſugred ſuggeſtions of Sathan, the delightſome vanities of the world, nor the brittle and ſhort pleaſures of the fleſh, nor by compelling and driuing my deeds and actions to obeie cleane contrarie to my conſcience. Neither let ſinne reigne in me to damnation, as it did in Saule, by not regarding thy word, by furie, wrath, malice and contempt of thy commandements: that I be not ouerwhelmed in terrors and woonderfull great furies, nor drowned in eternall damnation; but helpe me, that in temptations I may conſtantlie ſtand, and valiantlie reſiſt, and in all dread and diſtreſſe be lifted vp, and comforted with the voice of the Goſpell, as it is written: Sinne ſhall not beare rule ouer you, for you are not vnder the lawe, but vnder grace. So ſhall it come to paſſe, that though this tyrant ſin

rob and rage neuer ſo cruellie, yet I through faith imbracing the ſweet comfort of the Goſpell, and beleeuing ſurelie that it is pardoned, and the terrors of the lawe ouercome, by the conqueſt and triumph of our mediator and Lord Ieſus Chriſt, it ſhall not ouercome me; but I it in him, through the helpe of his holie ſpirit, power and grace, which grant vnto me, O Lord I beſeech thee, for thy holie name ſake,
                     Amen.
                  
                  
                     Meditations after praier.
                     
                        O Lord God heauenlie Father, which to declare thy readines in hearing of ſinners, moſt mercifullie haſt ſaid, that before they crie, I will anſwer, and whileſt they are yet in thinking what to ſpeake, I will heare: vouchſafe, we beſeech thee, for the ſame thy great mercies ſake, fauourablie to heare our requeſts, and gratiouſlie grant all theſe our poore petitions, which we haue aſked of thee, not truſting in our owne righteouſneſſe, which we acknowledge with the Prophet to be ſtained and defiled, but onlie in thy manifold mercies and promiſes. And grant, that at what time ſoeuer thy good ſpirit doth mooue vs to call vpon thee, we may aſke ſuch things, and in ſuch ſort as thou requireſt, to thy honor and glorie, our neighbors profit, and our owne ſoules health, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord,
                     Amen.
                  
                  
                     Or thus, for a concluſion of the whole praiers.
                     
                        O My good God, which haſt commanded all men to call vpon thee in all their troubles, need and neceſſitie, and haſt promiſed ſo to heare them, and deliuer them, that they ſhall praiſe thee: and haſt promiſed to be preſt and readie at hand to all ſuch as feare thee, and call vpon thee faithfullie, and that thou wilt fulfill their deſires, and helpe them: now I haue called vpon thee, not in mine owne woorthineſſe, for to me belongeth nothing but wrath,

ſhame and confuſion: but in the name and woorthineſſe of thy ſweet Sonne Ieſus Chriſt mine onlie mediator and aduocate. For vnto thee belongeth mercie and forgiueneſſe.
                     Oh deere God, I beſeech thee for his ſake forgiue me all my ſinnes; increaſe my faith; purge my corruption; helpe mine infirmitie; confirme mine hope, and grant me all thoſe things that I haue praied for, and all other things, that thou knoweſt to be moſt neceſſarie, profitable, and expedient for me, and thy whole Church, (although mine infirmitie dare not, and my blindneſſe can not aſke them) ſo as the ſame may redound to thy glorie, and profit of thy Church, the reformation of my life, and mine aſſured ſaluation and conſolation in thy Sonne Ieſus Chriſt mine onelie Lord, Mediator, and Sauiour, in whoſe name I beſeech thee: Our Father which art, &c.
                     
                  
                  
                     EVENING praiers, and firſt, At the Sunne ſetting praie.
                     
                        O Sunne of righteouſneſſe, euermore ariſing, and neuer going downe. O brightneſſe of perpetuall charitie, euer ſhining, and neuer darkened. In this Euening now the Sunne hath run his courſe, and is going downe; and the daie being farre ſpent, it draweth towards night. I praie thee de part not thou from vs, neither let the Sunne of thy grace ſet, or ceaſe to giue light vnto our ſoules: but that in thee we may abide, and alwaies haue daie light moſt cleerelie in our minds, to knowe, loue, and praiſe thee perpetuallie in the viſion of that light, where thou the Sunne of all glorie dooeſt euerlaſtinglie ſhine vpon thine elect, making them to ſhine as the Sunne before

thee, & where the Sunne ſhall not go down by daie, nor the Moone lie hid by night. For there ſhall be no night, neither light of the Sunne or Moone: but thou, O Lord our God, ſhalt be our euerlaſting light, and inlighten vs with vnſpeakable glorie for euer, Amen.
                     
                     
                        Lord let not the Sunne go downe vpon our wrath: but make vs to feare thee as long as the Sunne and Moone endureth.
                     
                     
                        Meditation.
                        THinke now of the brittle ſtate of the world, the glorie whereof, like the Sunne or Moone, is verie vnconſtant, variable, and now vp, now downe: but the goodneſſe of God onelie is permanent, and endureth for euer.
                        Thinke alſo, that as it is no gréefe for vs to ſée the Sunne to ſet, bicauſe we expect his ariſing againe in the morning: no more ought we (as men without hope) to be ſorie for the death of the bodie, knowing that in the morning light of the reſurrection it ſhall eftſoones ariſe, & receiue the ſoule againe to ioie, or paine eternall.
                     
                     
                        VVhen the candles or lamps be light, praie:
                        
                        
                           THanks be giuen to thee O Lord, which after daie, when night commeth, haſt giuen vs for the remedie of darkneſſe this artificiall light of the candle or lampe, whereby we ſee and diſcerne thoſe things in this night of our bodies, which are expedient for vs to vſe. But eſpeciallie we render immortall praiſe vnto thine holie Maieſtie, for the light of thy doctrine, which thy Sonne againſt the horrour of ſinne and ignorance, hath brought vnto vs for a remedie againſt death eternall. Grant, we beſeech thee O Lord of light, and Maiſter of all truth, that the moſt thicke and obſcure clouds of our minds may be ſo driuen awaie and expelled by the lampe of thy grace, and candle of knowledge and right vnderſtanding, that in bodie corporallie, and

in ſoule ſpirituallie, wee may euer ſee by both theſe lights to glorifie thee, both in our liues and in our deaths.
                        
                           Thy word, ô Lord, is a lampe to our feete, and a light vnto our paths. O light thou our candle, and make our darkneſſe to be light, that with our lamps euer burning, we may ſtill watch for thy comming!
                        
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Meditation.
                        THinke now, that as without this materiall light of the candle all would be horrour and vncouth darkneſſe: euen ſo without the ſpirituall light of Gods diuine word and wiſedome, all our light is darkneſſe; our knowledge errour; and our life death and vtter confuſion.
                        Thinke alſo, that as the candle is not put vnder a buſhell, but ſet on a candleſticke to giue light to all in the houſe: ſo likewiſe ought we to let the light of our faith ſhine bright before men, that other ſéeing our good works may therefore glorifie God.
                     
                     
                        Euening praiers for Sundaie to be ſaid kneeling by the bedſide, before you make you vnreadie. ¶ Here you may ſaie one of the confeſſions for the Sabboth daie, as before, pag. 384, 387.
                        
                           WE render vnto thee euerlaſting praiſes, moſt mercifull Father, for that of thy gratious fauour and loue towards vs, thou haſt vouchſafed to preſerue vs this daie, and the reſt of our life hitherto vnder the ſhadowe of thy moſt mercifull protection, beſeeching thee alſo to take vs into thy tuition this preſent night and euer, that we be not tempted with anie ſuggeſtion of Sathan; but being thoroughlie armed with the holie Ghoſt, we may haue power and force to reſiſt his aſſaults, by a ſure faith and confidence in the bloud of thy bleſſed Sonne our

Lord and Sauiour Chriſt Ieſus. Giue vs grace to repent vs of our ſinnes vnfeinedlie; to craue remiſſion of them vnceſſantlie; to imbrace thy holie word and commandements ſincerelie; and to expreſſe them in our liuing effectuallie: whereby we may walke vprightlie in our conuerſation, with ſure and certaine hope of the reſurrection to eternall life, by the merits of Chriſt Ieſus, that with the wiſe virgins we may be found waking and watching for his comming, when he ſhall come to iudge the world with equitie, and to reward euerie man according to the works of his bodie. Grant vs grace, moſt mercifull Father, to behaue our ſelues ſo vprightlie in this life, that then we may be made partakers of thy kingdome with thine elect, there to liue in eternall ioie and felicitie, world without end,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another Euening praier on the Lords daie.
                        
                        
                           O Almightie and eternall God, Father of our Lord Ieſu Chriſt, which togither with thy Sonne and the holie Ghoſt, didſt create man after thine owne likeneſſe, and breath into him the breth of life, the which through thy goodnes continueth at thy pleaſure. Thou haſt made of one bloud all mankind, and aſſigned times, and length of our life in this world: thou giueſt life to the people on the earth, and breth to the walkers therein, which if thou take awaie, they ſhall depart, and be turned into duſt. We bleſſe thee heauenlie Father, and with all our harts giue thee thanks, not onelie for ſauing vs this daie from dangers: but alſo from our cradles for defending both our ſoules and bodies from death. Wherefore magnifie the Lord, O our ſoules, and our

ſpirits reioice in God our Sauiour. For he hath looked vpon the baſeneſſe and afflictions of his ſeruants. He that is mightie hath done for vs great things, and holie is his name. Wherefore we will praiſe the Lord for euermore, bicauſe his mercie endureth from generation to generation on ſuch as feare him. We will ſhew foorth his power in the euening, and when we go to bed, we will remember his mercie. Ariſe now our ſoules in the night, praiſe your God. In the beginning of the watches powre out your harts like water before the face of the Lord. For the Saints will be ioifull with glorie, & ſing lowd vpon their beds. Wherefore we alſo will praiſe thee continuallie, and will confeſſe thy name for euermore. For thou art the God, which delighteth our harts, and maketh our ſoules merie. Therefore in the night we will thinke vpon thy benefits, and our ſpirits ſhall conſider of thy woonderous works. For thou haſt commanded that thy mercie be celebrated in the daie time, and thy truth in the night ſeaſon.
                        O our Lord, and God of mercie, gentleneſſe, patience, pitie, and truth, which ſhe weſt mercie vnto thouſands, and blotteſt out all our offences: we lift vp our ſoules vnto thee, and from our harts we praie thee, put not before thine eies the horrible confuſion, vncleanneſſe, and wickedneſſe of our minds, being repleniſhed with loathſome darkneſſe and ignorance, full of doubtings and errors. Our harts and will are turned from thee our God, and all the powers and ſtrength both of our ſoules and bodies are defiled, and filthilie weakened: but Lord, of thy great merice blot out our offences, looke vpon the troubles and dolours of our harts, and forgiue all our ſinnes. For lo, our ſoules are wounded, and can not be holpen, but onelie through mercie. There is no health in our fleſh bicauſe of thine anger, neither is there reſt in our bones, bicauſe of our ſins.

For our iniquities haue gone ouer our heads, and as an heauie burden haue preſſed vs down. Our wounds are putrified and corrupt, bicauſe of our fooliſhneſſe. Aſſwage thine anger, and turne from thine indignation. Pardon our faults, remit all puniſhment, and reſtore in vs the light of thy goodneſſe, which was loſt. O Lord heare; O Lord forgiue; harken O our God, for thine owne ſake. For thy name is called vpon by vs.
                        O God of heauen and earth, in this euening tide doo we call vnto thee, that remitting our ſinnes, which this daie eſpeciallie we haue committed againſt thee in breaking thy Saboth, and prophaning this our holie daie with our vnholie deeds, ſpeech and cogitations, thou wouldeſt receiue vs into thy protection, and keepe vs and all ours this night, that the diuell haue no power ouer vs. Be thou watchfull ouer vs, O eternall Sauiour, leaſt the ſubtill tempter apprehend vs. For thou art made for vs an euerlaſting protector. For behold, whether we ſleepe or wake, whether we liue or die, we are thine: thou art our Creator and redeemer. Stand therefore on our behalfe in the watch with the armie of thy celeſtiall warriers thine Angels, which being filled with perfect goodneſſe, and perpetuall integritie, behold thy face alwaies in the heauens. Expell from vs and our houſes wicked ſpirits, which bee our mortall enimies, that they damage vs in no caſe, and deliuer vs from perſecutors, which laie ſnares for our deſtruction. Turne not away thy mercie and truth from vs. O God aſſiſt vs, that peaceablie we may reſt, and ſleepe in quiet. We will laie vs downe in peace, and ſleepe. For thou Lord alone makeſt vs to dwell in ſafetie without danger. Hide vs in thy tabernacle, O Lord, that ſitting in thy ſecret place, and abiding vnder the ſhadowe of thy wings, we may ſaie vnto thee; Lord, thou art our keeper, and our refuge. O God, we will truſt in thee, and will feare no danger. And although

we were in extreame darkneſſe, yet will wee not feare. Though we ſhould walke in the midſt of the ſhadowe of death, yet will we dread none euill, for thou art with vs; thy rod and thy ſtaffe they doo comfort vs. Let thy mercie, O God, followe vs all the daies of our life, that we may dwell in thy houſe in longneſſe of daies, praiſing thee euermore with the Sonne & holie Ghoſt one true God, reigning worlds without end,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Another more large Euening praier, with Confeſsion.
                        
                        
                           O Lord God, Father euerlaſting, and full of pitie, we acknowledge and confeſſe, that we be not woorthie to lift vp our eies to heauen, much leſſe to preſent our ſelues before thy Maieſtie, with confidence that thou wilt heare our praiers, and grant our requeſts, if we conſider our owne deſeruings. For our conſciences doo accuſe vs, and our ſinnes beare witneſſe againſt vs; and we knowe that thou art an vpright iudge, which dooeſt not iuſtifie the ſinners and wicked men, but puniſheſt the faults of all ſuch as tranſgreſſe thy commandements. Yet moſt mercifull Father, ſince it hath pleaſed thee to command vs to call on thee in all our troubles and aduerſities, promiſing euen then to helpe vs, when we feele our ſelues as it were ſwallowed vp of death & deſperation: we vtterlie renounce all worldlie confidence, and flie to thy ſouereigne bountie, as our onlie ſtaie and refuge, beſeeching thee not to call to remembrance our manifold ſinnes and wickedneſſe, whereby we continuallie prouoke thy wrath and indignation againſt vs: neither our negligence and vnkindneſſe, which haue neither woorthilie eſteemed, nor in our liues ſufficientlie expreſſed the ſweet comfort of thy Goſpell reuealed vnto vs, but rather to accept

the obedience and death of thy Sonne, who by offering vp his bodie in ſacrifice once for all, hath made a ſufficient recompenſe for all our ſinnes. Haue mercie therefore vpon vs, O Lord, & forgiue vs our offences. Teach vs by thy holie ſpirit that we may rightlie way them, and earneſtlie repent for the ſame; and ſo much the rather, O Lord, becauſe that the reprobate, & ſuch as thou haſt forſaken, can not praiſe thee, nor call vpon thy name, but the repenting hart, the ſorowfull mind, the conſcience oppreſſed, hungering and thirſting for thy grace, ſhall euer ſet forth thy praiſe and glorie. And albeit we be but woorms & duſt, yet thou art our Creator, and we be the worke of thy hands: yea thou art our Father, and we thy children; thou art our ſhepheard, and we thy flocke; thou art our redeemer, & we the people whom thou haſt bought; thou art our God, and we thine inheritance. Correct vs not therefore in thine anger, O Lord, neither according to our deſerts puniſh vs, but mercifullie chaſtiſe vs with a fatherlie affection, that all the world may knowe, that at what time ſoeuer a ſinner doth repent him of his ſins from the bottome of his hart, thou wilt put awaie his wickedneſſe out of thy remembrance, as thou haſt promiſed by thy holie Prophet.
                        Finallie, we humblie thanke thee, O mercifull Father, by thy deerelie beloued Sonne Ieſus Chriſt our Sauiour, for all thy benefits beſtowed vpon vs from the beginning of the world to this time, for our election, our creation, our redemption, our ſanctification, & continuall preſeruation; and namelie, for that of thy mercie and goodneſſe thou haſt preſerued vs this daie, and all the time of our life hitherto, from all miſfortunes, hurts and dangers bodilie & ghoſtlie. And forſomuch as it hath pleaſed thee to make the night for man to reſt in, as thou haſt ordeined him the daie to trauell, and that whither we ſleepe or wake, liue or die, we are

alwaies thine: grant, O deere Father, that we may ſo take our bodilie reſt this night, that our ſoules and harts being kindled with the light of thy countenance, may continuallie watch for the time that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſhall appeare for our deliuerance out of this mortall life. And in the meane ſeaſon, take thou, O God, care and charge of vs and all ours, that we periſh not in the works of darkeneſſe, and that we (not ouercome by anie fantaſies, dreames, or other temptations) may fullie ſet our minds vpon thee, loue thee, feare thee, and reſt in thee. Furthermore, that our ſleepe be not exceſſiue or ouermuch, after the inſatiable deſires of the fleſh, but onlie ſufficient to content our weake nature, that enioieng ſweet ſleepe and comfortable reſt both in bodie and mind, we may healthfullie and ioifullie riſe againe, and be the better diſpoſed to liue in all godlie conuerſation and perfect obedience of thy word, to the glorie of thy holie name, and profit of thy Church, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, in whoſe name we furthermore make our humble petitions vnto thee, not onlie for our ſelues, but for all others, whome thou wouldeſt we ſhould continuallie praie for, ſaieng as he in his holie word hath taught vs, Our Father which art in heauen, &c.
                        
                        O Lord increaſe our faith, ſtrengthen it in thy manifold ſweet promiſes, and grant vs a perfect continuance therein to our liues end, whereof we humblie make our confeſſion, ſaieng: I beleeue in God, &c.
                        
                        Let thy mightie hand, and out-ſtretched arme, O Lord, be ſtill our defence; thy mercie and louing kindnes in Ieſu Chriſt thy deere Sonne our ſaluation; thy true & holie word our inſtruction; thy life & holie actions our imitation; thy grace & holie ſpirit our comfort & conſolatiō vnto the end & in the end: and the bleſſing of God almightie, Father, Sonne, and holie Ghoſt, be with vs, and remaine with vs now & euer,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        
                        A forme of generall praier, to be vſed in priuate houſes and families euerie Euening. O Lord prepare our harts to praier: for if we praie with our lips onlie, our praiers are abhominable. O teach vs therefore by thy holie ſpirit to praie rightlie, according to thy will, and giue eare gratiouſlie to our calling.
                        
                           O Gratious Lord & louing Father, according to thy commandement we doo heere preſent our ſelues before thy Maieſtie, humblie proſtrating our ſelues before thy throne of mercie, acknowledging and confeſſing from the bottom of our harts, that we be miſerable ſinners, dailie breaking thy commandements both in thought, word, and deede, wherein we iuſtlie deſerue euerlaſting damnation, and to be vtterlie throwne from thy preſence. Yet, O Lord, we ſee thy goodneſſe againe towards vs, who not ſuffering vs thus to periſh in our ſinnes, haſt ſent thine owne deere Sonne Ieſus Chriſt, to take vpon him whatſoeuer is due, to reconcile and make vs at one with thee againe. In him therefore, good Lord, and through him doo we come vnto thee, beſeeching thee for his ſake, that we feeling the greeuouſneſſe of our ſins, and groaning vnder the burthen of them, may feele the releaſe and eaſe of them, in that we be through thy holie ſpirit aſſured, and ſtedfaſtlie beleeue, that Chriſt hath borne the burthen of them euen for vs. Grant O Lord, that we being aſſured heereof in our conſcience, may through thy holie ſpirit be renewed in the inward man, to hate, deteſt, and abhorre ſinne, and to ſtudie to liue acording to thy bleſſed will during this whole life.
                        We doo not onlie praie for our ſelues, O Lord, but alſo for all the whole Church, eſpeciallie ſuch as be perſecuted for thy word: grant vnto them, that whither it be by death or life, they may glorifie thy name to their liues end. Be mercifull to this Church of England

and Ireland we beſeech thee good Lord, and preſerue euerie part and member of the ſame, eſpeciallie thy ſeruant Elizabeth our gratious Queene and Gouernour. Grant hir all ſuch gifts as be needfull for ſo high a calling, to the aduancement of thy glorie, and the benefit of this Common-wealth: to the eſtabliſhing of a perfect gouernement of thy Church, according to the preſcriptrule of thy bleſſed word, to the rooting out of all ſuperſtition, idolatrie, and relikes of Antichriſt, to the gouerning of hir ſubiects in all peace and tranquillitie. Defend hir, O Lord, from all conſpiracies, treaſons, and rebellions, and ſo worke in the harts of all hir ſubiects, that knowing hir authoritie doth come from thy heauenlie Maieſtie, they may with obedient harts humblie obeie hir in thee and for thee. Preſerue the whole Counſell & the Magiſtrates of the Realme, that being lightened by thy holy ſpirit, they may defend the truth, ſuppreſſe wickedneſſe, and mainteine equitie. Behold all the paſtors and preachers of thy word: bleſſe their labours, increaſe the number of them; place ouer euerie Church a painefull watchman: remoue all idle lubbers, and confound the power of Antichriſt, and turne the harts of the people, that they may be obedient to the truth. Bleſſe the two Uniuerſities, Cambridge and Oxford, and all the ſtudents of the ſame, with all the Schooles of learning. Behold all thoſe that be afflicted with anie kinde of croſſe, that they may profit by thy correction in newneſſe of life.
                        Laſtlie for our ſelues heere gathered togither, we render moſt hartie thanks to thy Maieſtie, O Lord, which haſt hitherto from our infancie preſerued vs by thy mercie, from all perils and dangers both of ſoule and bodie, wherevnto fraile man is ſubiect, that thou haſt ſent vnto vs all things neceſſarie for this preſent life, as health, food, apparell, and ſuch like, which manie

of thy deere children doo want, being notwithſtanding as pretiouſlie bought with the pretious bloud of thy deere Sonne as we be, and yet lie in miſerie and calamitie, oppreſſed with pouertie, nakedneſſe, impriſonment, and baniſhment; in which caſe alſo deere Father, thou mighteſt haue brought vs, ſaue onlie that thou dealeſt heerein more fauourablie with vs than with them. For the which thy louing kindneſſe, we giue thee hartie thanks, deſiring thee, that as thou haſt hitherto thus fauorablie in mercie preſerued vs by thy protection, and euen preſentlie this daie haſt brought vs paſt all the dangers thereof: ſo we beſeech thee good Lord, in like fauour behold vs this night, that we taking our naturall reſt and quietneſſe, may through thy protection be ſo defended, that our bodies reſting, our ſoules may be occupied in beholding thy fauour and mercie towards thy children, ſtill looking for the comming of our Lord and Sauiour Ieſu Chriſt, for our full redemption. Grant that our ſleepe be not immoderate, according to the luſts of the fleſh, but as much as is ſufficient to refreſh our weake nature, that being thus refreſhed, both the bodie & the mind may be more able to doo their ſeuerall office and function in that vocation wherein thou haſt placed vs. Grant, that wee laieng our bodies downe to reſt, may be thereby put in mind of our long reſt of death: that as we doo laie downe our bodies in bed, ſo we may be thereby admoniſhed, that hereafter they ſhall be laid down in graue, to be conſumed to duſt, earth, and aſhes, from whence they were taken, that we hauing this before our eies, may be ſtirred vp in minde warilie to walke in this our pilgrimage, not knowing when the time ſhall be of our departure, but alwaies be found readie with our lamps of pure faith clearelie burning, that we may be accepted to meet the bride groome, when our mortall, earthlie, and corruptible bodies ſhall be made

like to the glorious bodie of our Lord and Sauiour Chriſt Ieſus, there to reigne with him in perpetuall ioie & conſolation, togither with all the elect children of GOD, continuallie lauding with all the heauenlie multitude the glorious Maieſtie of thee our Lord God and heauenlie Father, in our Lord and Sauiour Ieſu Chriſt. In whoſe name for theſe thy mercies, and whatſoeuer elſe thou knoweſt to be needfull for vs, and thy whole Church, we praie vnto thee, as he himſelfe hath taught vs, ſaieng: Our Father, which art in heauen, &c.
                        
                        The Lord bleſſe vs and ſaue vs, the Lord make his face to ſhine vpon vs, and be mercifull vnto vs: the Lord turne his fauourable countenance towards vs, and grant vs his peace.
                        The grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, the loue of God the Father, and the moſt comfortable felowſhip of the holie Ghoſt be with vs, preſerue and keepe vs this night and euermore,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        VVhen you vncloth yourſelfe, and make you vnreadie to bedward, praie:
                        
                        
                           THis our life and weake knit bodie by reaſon of ſinne, by little and little ſhall be diſſolued, and ſo ſhall be reſtored to the earth, from whence it was taken: then will be an end of this vanitie, which by our fooliſhnes we haue wrought to our ſelues. O moſt meeke Father, ſo doo thou vntie and looſe me (for thou haſt knit me togither) that I may perceiue my ſelfe to be looſed and diſſolued, and ſo may remember both of whom I was made, and alſo whither I go, leaſt I be had vnprepared vnto thy tribunali and iudgement ſeate. And as I willinglie now put off my garments, which in the morning I ſhall put on again: ſo let me not vnwillinglie put off this my

bodie, whenſoeuer by death it ſhall pleaſe thee O God, to call me; eſpeciallie for that I knowe that after the night of this world is expired, I ſhall receiue it on againe in much better light to immortalitie: So be it.
                        
                        
                           
                              Put off the old man with his luſts and concupiſcences, and be content with Ioſeph to put off your priſon apparell, that you may put on new.
                              I haue put off my cloaths: how ſhall I put them on? O Lord, I will confeſſe my wickedneſſe, and that of my ſelfe I haue nothing.

                        VVhen you wash your feete, praie thus to your ſelfe.
                        
                        
                           O Moſt meeke and louing Ieſu, the perfect paterne of all humilitie, who being Lord of heauen and earth, didſt not diſdaine to waſh thy Diſciples feet, and wipe them cleane with the towell wherewith thou waſt girt, and that for our example to teach vs to loue and ſerue one another in thee: haue mercie on me a miſerable ſinner, which from top to toe, both within and without, am altogither polluted and defiled with ſinne in thy ſight. And with Peter I humblie beſeech thee, vouchſafe now to waſh me in the ſweet bath of thy pretious bloud, from all the filth and polluſions of my ſinnes, that I may be whiter than ſnowe. Waſh thou, I ſaie, not my feet onelie, O Lord, but my hands and head: yea my verie hart, ſoule, and conſcience alſo. For if thou waſh me not, I ſhall haue no part with thee; but if thou waſh me, I ſhall be cleane euerie whit in all parts, yea cleaner than the glaſſe. O waſh mee therfore cleane from mine vncleanneſſe, and doo awaie all my ſinnes, negligences, and ignorances: yea ſo purge and ſcowre all mine affections by thy grace and mercie, that with both my feete, that is to ſaie, with

perfect loue to thee, and true charitie to my neighbor, I may walke in the paths of thy peace by the direction of thy ſpirit, and at the laſt come pure and cleane vnto thee my purifier, to the confuſion and ſhame of mine enimies, which in the daie of my death ſhall moſt buſilie watch to trip and ouerthrowe me: ſo ſhall I bleſſe and praiſe thee, with thine elect and holie Saints in euerlaſting happineſſe,
                        Amen.
                        
                           I haue waſhed my feete: how ſhall I file them againe.

                        Another.
                        
                           O Moſt mercifull Ieſu, which gentlie ſufferedſt that ſinfull woman Marie Magdalen to approch vnto thy preſence, and to waſh thy bleſſed feet with hir teares; to wipe them with hir heare; and to kiſſe and annoint them with coſtlie oile, and diddeſt greatlie commend this hir fact to all poſteritie, haue mercie on me a more ſinfull woman in thy ſight; and grant me grace likewiſe continuallie to waſh thy feete with the teares of true contrition; to wipe them with the heare of mine obedience; to kiſſe them with the kiſſes of feruent loue of thee and thy Saints, and to annoint them with the ſweet oile of deuout praiers, confeſſions, and thanks-giuing, that I may obtaine by thy mercie forgiueneſſe of all my manifold ſinnes, and feele my ſelfe much bound vnto thee for my ſaluation. Finallie, let me thine handmaid be a ſeruant, I praie thee, to waſh the feet of the ſeruants of my Lord: make me I ſaie, of the number of thoſe holie matrons, that willinglie waſh the feet of thy Saints, that miniſter vnto them that are in aduerſitie, that are continuallie giuen to euery good worke, and be well reported of for their vertues, through Ieſu Chriſt our Lord,
                        Amen.
                        
                           Waſh you, make you cleane, take awaie the euill of your works from before mine eies: ceaſe to doo euill, and learne to doo well.

                        VVhen you enter into your bed, praie:
                        
                        
                           I Enter into my bed, and laie mee downe to reſt, in the name of the Father, the Sonne, and the holie Ghoſt. The Lord Ieſu Chriſt, which was crucified, dead, and buried for me, bleſſe, preſerue, and keepe me both bodie and ſoule, and raiſe me with him, at the laſt daie by the power of his glorious reſurrection to life euerlaſting, Amen.
                        
                        And grant, O God, I beſeech thee, that as I am not afraid now to enter into my bed, and to diſpoſe my ſelfe to ſleepe: ſo I may not be afraid or loth to die; but rather cheerfullie prepare my ſelfe thervnto, and euermore deſire to be diſſolued, and to be with Chriſt my Sauiour,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Being new laid in your bed, ſaie this Pſalme.
                        
                        
                           O Lord, thou haſt ſearched me out, & knowne me, thou knoweſt my downe lieng, and mine vpriſing, thou vnderſtandeſt all my thoughts long before.
                        Thou art about my path, and about my bed, and ſpieſt out all my waies. For lo, there is not a word in my tongue; but thou, O Lord, knoweſt it altogither.
                        Thou haſt faſhioned me behind and before, and laid thine hand vpon me. Such knowledge is too woonderfull and excellent for me, I can not attaine vnto it.
                        Whither then ſhall I go from thy ſpirit? Or whither ſhall I go from thy preſence?
                        If I clime vp into heauen, thou art there: if I godowne to hell, thou art there alſo: if I take the wings of the morning, and remaine in the vttermoſt parts of the ſea; euen there alſo ſhall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand ſhall hold me.
                        
                           
If I ſaie, Peraduenture the darkenes ſhall couer me, then ſhall my night be turned to daie: yea the darkneſſe is no darkeneſſe with thee, but the night is as cleere as the daie: the darkeneſſe and light to thee are both alike.
                        For my reines are thine: thou haſt couered me in my mothers wombe. I will giue thanks vnto thee, for I am fearefullie and woonderfullie made. Maruellous are thy works, and that my ſoule knoweth right well.
                        My bones are not hid from thee, though I be made ſecretlie, and faſhioned beneath in the earth. Thine eies did ſee my ſubſtance, yet being vnperfect, and in thy booke are all my members written, which daie by daie were faſhioned, when as yet there was none of them.
                        How deere are thy counſelles vnto me, O God? O how great is the ſumme of them? If I tell them, they are more in number than the ſand, when I wake vp, I am preſent with thee.
                        Trie me, O God, and ſeeke the ground of my hart; prooue me, and examine my thoughts; looke well if there be anie waie of wickedneſſe in me, and leade me in the waie euerlaſting.
                        Let me neuer imagine miſchiefe vpon my bed, as doo the vngodlie that ſet themſelues in no good waie, and can not ſleepe before they haue done ſome harme; but make me to abhorre the thing that is euill, and to commune with mine owne hart, and in my chamber to be ſtill, that with the Saincts I may be ioifull with glorie, and reioice on my bed with them that praiſe thee daie and night.
                        Finallie, grant that I may behold thy preſence in righteouſneſſe, and when I awake vp after thy likeneſſe, bring to paſſe that I may be ſatiſfied with it, and glorifie thee eternallie,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        
                        The Praier.
                        
                           THE daie now ended, men giue themſelues to reſt in the night, and ſo this life finiſhed, we ſhall reſt in death. Nothing is more like this life than euerie daie; nothing more like death, than ſleepe; nothing more like to our graue, than our bed. O Lord our keeper and defender, grant that I now laieng me downe to reſt, being vnable to keepe my ſelfe, may be preſerued from the crafts and aſſaults of the wicked enimie: and grant furthermore that when I haue tunne the race of this life, thou wouldeſt of thy mercie call me vnto thee, that I may liue and watch with thee for euermore. And now, O gratious God, giue me to take my reſt in thee, & bring to paſſe that thy goodneſſe may be euen in ſleepe before mine eies, that ſleeping I be not abſent from thee, but may haue my dreames to drawe me vnto thee, and ſo both in ſoule and bodie may be kept pure and holie for euer,
                        Amen.
                        
                           I will laie me downe in peace, and take my reſt: for it is thou Lord onlie that makeſt me dwell in ſafetie.

                           O Lord our GOD, our protector and defender, which diddeſt gratiouſlie preſerue and keepe thy ſeruant holie Tobie, when he laie with his wife Sara, by the gard of thine holie Angel, ſo that Sathan was bound, and had no power ouer them, keepe vs alſo, O King of kings, and Lord of lords this night and euermore, that that ſubtill Serpent by no meanes haue power to vexe or greeue vs; but that we may ſlepe this night in the remembrance of thee, into whoſe tuition and keeping we commit vs

both bodie and ſoule, which haſt bought & redeemed vs with the pretious bloud of that immaculate Lambe thy deere ſonne, and our deere beloued Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt; to whom with the holie Ghoſt be all honour and glorie,
                        Amen.
                     
                     
                        Meditation.
                        REmember now, that you be néerer your end by one daies iournie than you were in the morning.
                        Alſo that this troubleſome daie is paſt, and night come; and ther withall reſt, quietneſſe, and pleaſant ſléepe, which maketh moſt excellent princes and poore wretches all alike for the time: euen ſo, after the tumults, troubles, temptations, and tempeſts of this life, if we beléeue in Chriſt, we haue prepared for vs an hauen and reſt moſt pleaſant, ioifull, and perpetuall.
                     
                     
                        VVhen you put out the candle, ſaie:
                        
                           THE light of the vngodlie ſhall be put out, and the light of his candle ſhall not ſhine: the light ſhall be darke in his dwelling, and his candle ſhall be put out with him: yea full often ſhall the candle of the wicked be put out, and their deſtruction ſhall ſuddenlie come vpon them, ſo that all ſhall be horror, and full of darknes with them. O Lord, let not our candle be put out, nor the light that is in vs be turned into darkneſſe: but lighten thou our candle, and make thou our darkneſſe to be light: yea lighten thou our darkneſſe, we beſeech thee O Lord, that we ſleepe not in death, and by thy great mercie defend vs from all perils and dangers of this darke and dredfull night, and lighten & illuminate thou euerie darke corner of our habitation with thy light, that our candle go not out by night: for the loue of thy Sonne our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt: So be it.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                        A little while after ſaie.
                        
                           O God, although we were in extreame darkeneſſe, yet will we not feare: and though we ſhould walke in the midſt of the ſhadowe of death, yet will we dread none euill. For thou art with vs, thy rod and thy ſtaffe doo comfort vs.
                        Now therefore that we lie in darkneſſe, be thou our protector, bring vs to thy light, and ſaue vs from vtter darkeneſſe, where is weeping and gnaſhing of teeth: that we may behold thee in that cleere light of the perpetuall morning, where ſhall be no darknes, no night, nor need of anie candle or materiall light: but thou, Lord wilt inlighten vs with vnſpekable glorie, So be it.

                           O Lord Ieſu Chriſt, my watchman and keeper, take me to thy care, grant that my bodie ſleeping, my mind may watch in thee, & be made merie by ſome ſight of that celeſtiall and heauenlie life, wherein thou art the King and Prince, togither with the Father & the holie Ghoſt, where thine Angels and holie ſpirits be moſt happie citizens. Oh purifie my ſoule, keepe cleane my bodie, that in both I may pleaſe thee ſleeping and waking for euer,
                        Amen.
                        
                           Lord, into thy hands I commend my ſpirit. For thou haſt redeemed me, ô Lord thou God of truth.

                           O Lord aſſiſt vs, that peaceablie we may now reſt and ſleepe in quiet. Let our eies ſleepe, but let our harts wake vnto thee. O lighten thou our eies, that we ſleepe not in death,

that Sathan hurt vs not, and our enimie ſaie; I haue preuailed againſt thee: but watch ouer vs, O eternall ſauiour, leaſt the ſubtill tempter ouertake vs, and we ſleepe a perpetuall ſleepe, and wake no more. For thou art made our euerlaſting helper and protector.
                        Giue vs this night a good ſleepe, that quietlie without cares and anguiſh of mind we may take our reſt. Let not troubleſome dreams, and vaine fantaſies and apparitions of the night nor the diuell diſquiet vs. Defend vs this night from vncleane and troubleſome ſpirits, let not their ruſhings, ragings, and miſrule diſquiet vs. Keepe vs, good Lord, from ſights of Sathan, from ſnares and illuſions of the diuell.
                        But admoniſh our ſoules of miſeries to come, euen as thou didſt arme the Patriarches and Prophets by dreames and viſions in the night, when ſleepe came vpon them, from dangers nigh at hand, through thine heauenlie oracles; ſo gouerne and preſerue vs in ſleepe, that our ſoules come not into danger, danger, neither fall vpon the ſwoord and pit of perils.
                        Let vs not ſleepe in ſinne and contempt of ſaluation, as doo the children of night and darkeneſſe, but make vs of the number of thoſe which ſleepe in Ieſus, and whome thou, O Lord, in the reſurrection of the iuſt, & comming of thy Son, ſhalt not ſuffer to be preuented with ſleepe, but wilt bring with thine elect to meete him in the clouds, that whether we wake or ſleepe, we may liue togither with him, and obteine euerlaſting ſaluation, through the merits of his death & paſſion.
                        In thy name, O ſweet Ieſu, will we giue ſleepe to our eies, and ſlumber to our eie lids. O Sauiour of the world: ſaue vs Lord watching, and keepe vs ſleeping, that in peace we may both reſt and wake; and let our ſleepe be ſweet and healthfull to our bodies, that waking in the morning, we may riſe in good health, and delight in thee our God.
                        
                           
Grant alſo, that both being in bed aſleepe, and awake, we may alwaies remember our death, which is a paſſing to an immortall life, and withall our ioifull reſurrection to euerlaſting glorie.
                        Finallie, at our laſt gaſpe, when our harts pant, our ſtrength faileth, our ſight departeth, our hearing is deafe, our mouth dumbe; when our feet cannot go, nor our hands feele; when all our ſenſes forſake vs, giue vs, O bleſſed Trinitie, ſome ſenſe of eternall life, that we may taſt in this world the beginning of thine euerlaſting ioie, and at our departure out of this world, behold by faith thy diuine preſence, and ſo ſleepe quietlie to eternall life, Amen, Amen.
                        Lord haue mercie vpon vs.
                        Chriſt haue mercie vpon vs.
                        Lord into thy hands we commend our ſoules, becauſe thou haſt redeemed vs.
                        Lord Ieſu receiue our ſpirits.
                     
                     
                        At mid-night, if you happen to awake, praie:
                        
                        
                           HAue mercie vpon me, O God, after thy great goodneſſe, according to the multitude of thy mercies doo awaie mine offenſes.
                        Turne thy face from my ſinnes, and put out all my miſdeeds.
                        Make me a cleane hart, O God, and renew a right ſpirit within me.
                        Caſt me not away from thy preſence, and take not thy holie ſpirit from me.
                        I will remember thee, O God, in my bed, and thinke vpon thee now that I am waking, becauſe thou haſt beene mine helper.
                        Euen now in the night ſeaſon, while thou holdeſt mine eies waking, I ſaie, will I thinke of thee my creator, and make my praiers vnto thee my redeemer,

and God of my life, that my ſoule may not refuſe hir comfort.
                        In my bed now by night will I ſeeke thee whom my ſoule loueth: O let me find thee, and my ſoule embrace thee.
                        For with my ſoule doo I deſire thee now in the night ſeaſon, and with my ſpirit within me will I ſeeke thee in the morning.
                        Yea at mid-night I will ariſe vp to giue thanks vnto thee, O Lord, becauſe of thy righteous iudgements, and in the night watches I will lift vp my hands towards thy holie place, and bleſſe thee, and powre out my hart before thee, and ſaie:
                        Haue mercie vpon me, O God, haue mercie on me a moſt miſerable ſinner.
                        From the ſnares of the diuell, O Lord deliuer me: from the mid-night euill defend me, and in the houre of death, helpe me.

                        Meditation.
                        AT mid-night there was a crie made; Behold the bridegrome commeth, go out to meet him: bleſſed are thoſe virgins, whom the Lord, when he commeth, ſhall find waking.
                        O my ſoule, let vs therfore take héed, watch and praie, that wée may bée found prepared with our Lamps burning, readie to enter with our ſpouſe and Lord Ieſus vnto the wedding.
                     
                     
                        In the night, when you heare the clocke ſtrike, praie:
                        
                        
                           THE clocke of our conſcience dooth ring euerie minute the houre of death to be at hand. O mercifull God, grant vnto me therefore I beſeech thee a happie houre, & bleſſed departure out of this life, whenſoeuer it ſhall pleaſe thee to call me hence, and cauſe my ſoule to flie out of this bodie.

Be mercifull vnto me, O God, be mercifull vnto me a moſt miſerable ſinner, and deliuer me from the houre of temptation, death and damnation, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord,
                        Amen.

                        HE that hath ears to heare, let him heare. The daie of the Lord will come as a théefe in the night.
                        Watch therefore; becauſe yée know neither the daie, the time, nor the houre when the ſonne of man will come to iudgement.

                           INto the hands of thy vnſpeakable mercie, O Lord, I commend my wretched ſoule and bodie, my ſenſes, ſpeech, counſell, thoughts, works, & all things belonging vnto me, my lieng downe, and riſing vp, my faith and conuerſation, the whole courſe and end of my life, the daie and houre of my departure out of this world: finallie, my death, buriall, reſt and reſurrection; beſeeching thee, O Lord, now ſuffer mine eies to ſleepe, & mine eie lids to ſlumber, & the temples of my head to take ſome reſt, that my bed may comfort me, and my couch giue me ſome refreſhing. Grant that I may ſo ſleepe, gouerne, and end my life, that I may ſleepe in peace, and reſt in thee. Sticke thou to me, O my God, euen to the end, that ſleepe with reſt, and reſt with quietneſſe, & quietneſſe with euerlaſtingneſſe, may receiue me. For lo, I giue my ſelfe once againe to ſleepe and reſt in the name of thee, O Father, Sonne, and holie Ghoſt, euermore crieng and ſaieng, Haue mercie on me, O glorious Deitie; Haue mercie on me, O triumphant humanitie; Haue mercy on me, O bleſſed Trinitie, and receiue my ſpirit (yea rather thy ſpirit) into thy holy hands, & ſend me a ioifull reſurrection with all thy Saints, & elect people:
                        Amen, Amen.

                     NOt vnto vs O Alpha, not vnto vs O Omega; but vnto thy name O Iehoua be giuen all the glorie, for thy louing mercie and for thy truths ſake. For thou haſt directed the thoughts of our harts, and proſpered the works of our hands vpon vs; euen thou I ſaie, O Lord, haſt gouerned all our counſels & enterpriſes from heauen, & haſt gratiouſlie wrought all our works for vs. O let our mouthes therfore be filled with thy praiſe, and make vs continuallie thankefull, that we may giue woorthie honor and glorie to thée for ſo great graces and manifold benefits beſtowed vpon vs.
                  And now, forſomuch as thou haſt giuen euerie one of vs that portion of thy graces that hath pleaſed thée, and haſt commanded vs to occupie and vſe them to thy honor, till thou come: grant vs, whether we haue receiued little or much, that we doo not idelie or ſlothfullie neglect our dutie herein. Suffer vs not I ſaie, O ſwéet Chriſt with the reſt of the world; to fall aſléep in the pleaſant vanities of this life, and to forget the waiting for thy comming: but rather ſtirre vs vp by thy holie ſpirit faithfullie to vſe thy gifts giuen vnto vs, and in all warie watching, faſting, and earneſt praier continuallie to proſper and go forward in our holie calling, prouoking one another by good example to followe thée in true worſhip, and due obedience: and grant that all ambition, vaine glorie, hypocriſie, and diſſimulation being remooued, our chéefe care may be in all our dooings, ſtudies and labours, euer to ſéeke the increaſe of thine honor, and the aduancement of thy kingdome; and ſo with a ſingle eie reſpecting the praiſe which is of thée, looke and wait for the reward and recompenſe of our labours, not of men but of thée; that in that daie of thy ſecond comming, which ſhall be ſudden and fearefull to the wicked, we may with ioie and comfort méet thy ſonne in the aire; and when thou ſhalt heare our accounts, we may alſo receiue of thée through our redéemer Ieſus, not onlie praiſe and commendation, as thy good and faithfull ſeruants, whoſe liues are hid in thée; but alſo obtaine the finall end of our faith, and all holie exerciſes of the ſame, euen the ſaluation of our ſoules, to thine euerlaſting praiſe, high glorie, and perpetuall renowme, now and for euer, Amen.
                  (I ſaie) To God onlie be giuen all the Glorie.
