            THE MASQVE OF THE League and the Spanyard discouered.
            
               THE Tyrant of Spayne, gaping and watching a long time for the inuasion of Fraunce, and generall ruine of the French, working (to his own desire) the disorders not long since, and which yet continueth in all the estates of thys Realme. Seeing likewise, that the last of the house of The King 
                     〈◊〉
                   was 
                     〈◊〉

                   Fryar. 
               Valois swayed the Scepter, after the death of Monsieur his brother, who was reported to be poysoned; By his owne subtilty, & by the means of hys Agents, Ambassadour, and adhering Pencionars,

(whom he hath drawn into a very great and high hope, to his owne profit and their perdition) hath raised a League, and thereby engendred Monsters, more horrible and hiddious, then those that (of old) are sayd to be subdued by the valour of Alcmenaes Sonne.
            It were needlesse to make further search for newe horrours in the depth of Lybia: let mee rather question howe to banish hence the crueltie and barbarisme of these Scithians, Gothes by nature, these Moores & Sarrasin Spanyards, whose first Fathers had theyr originall from the Gothes, and from hence thys League (the mother of all mischiefe) that is heer so louingly cherished, had her beginning. Thys Pandora hath so cast abroade her poysons out of her boxe, as the ayre, the earth and men, beeing vnprouided of a counter-poyson, yea, very neere all things els, are infected therewith. It hath changed in many places, the face of this fayre Monarchie, into an Anarchie or many headed gouernment: it hath ouerthrowne the throne and royall Authoritie, violenced the Magistrates, murdered the Prince, peruerted all order and policie, both diuine and humane. It hath made Fraunce a den of theeues, murderers, robbers and spoylers, such Monsters hath thys League prodigiously brought foorth; among infinite of the very worst sort, is ignorance, malice, deceit, guile, hypocrisie, robbing, theft, incest, feigned Religion, all kinde of execrations,

murder, sacrilidge and parricide; thys Witch, engendered by the terror and ambition of the Spanyards, hath made a strange metamorphosis of a most beautifull estate.
            But GOD the Authour of all good, foreseeing in mercie such as he made choise of: gaue courage to theyr harts to detest thys Scithia, to flye from thys Lybia, whose Monsters strangle liuing men, as hath beene known and seene: and so to come into a sweete ayre, pure and not poysoned, vnder the gracious Lawes of their naturall and legittimate Princes. To worke this effect, (a meruaile amongst them esteemed of greatest meruaile) it is his will and pleasure, that out of a great euill, shoulde spring and arise as great a good, that from a most strange conspiracy of fellons, murderers, and parricides of theyr King, should be raised and lifted to the Maiestie royal, the man, whose life this Sorcerer daily sought to abridge & confound. For heereon did he build, and to this day doth builde all his arteficiall and pernicious deseignes, thinking heerby at one bit (as it were) to swallowe and deuoure the King, (whom the lustie cutters of this Medea, scornfully call a

               Thus thinking to ruinate and ouerthrowe at once thys very sickly estate, ready to stagger and fall downe vnder the burdenous weight of oppression: the onely and soueraigne meane of reliefe is found, and where the very stroke of death was directed against the hart, heere-hence ariseth the speciall remedie and medicine of the wounde.
            Thou Circes, what sayst thou? thou horrible Megera, what saist thou? thou forespent Sorcerer lyke the shadow of death, what saist thou? canst thou perswade thy selfe as yet to preuaile by thy enchauntments? are not thy false and poysoned drugs now manifestly discouered? knowes not each one thy counterfeit dissembling? are not thy vnderminings preuented? thy blowes rebated? thy sinnowes shrunke vp? holdest thou stil thys auncient withered Sarasin for thy support? puttest thou thy hope in the Duke of Parma and his Spanyards, who by nature vse crueltie euen towards thine own followers, because they loue the League no better then they doe theyr Kings, in respect they are French borne, & but serue themselues with them, onely to reache the highest of theyr tyrannous enterprise? thinkest thou yet to help thy selfe with thy Monks coule and hoode, to bath againe thy parricide hands in the bloode royall? VVhat meane is left thee whereby to exterminate thys royall house of Burbon, issued from S. Lewes, to whom God in

succeeding right hath trans-ferred the Crow
                  •
               e?
            Thou bendest thy browes, thou cursest, thou spightest, and grindest thy teeth to beholde all thy Magicke artes deluded, thou art ready to burst with rage and despight, and deafnest our eares with exclaimes, that thus at last thou art kept at a bay. The vertue, the Lawrell, the fortune and victories of our Hercules of Gaule, the queller of so many Monsters thy children, makes thee ready to die with fury, ther are so many punishments, and so many deserued corrections hammering in thy head. Thy goodly Armies, thy puissant forces, nor all thy presumption wil serue to benefit thee, the fields all couered with thy strange men at Armes, in short time will be (as oft heeretofore they haue beene) died and imbrewed in theyr owne vnhallowed bloode, by the strength which the great God of Armies, hath vouchsafed to the arme of our victorious Prince.
            How is it, that thou forcest reason? chaungest the Lawes, exterminatest the blood royall, and chasest the true heyres, to place a stranger in theyr roome? who can endure this? No, no, the valiant, vertuous, and most magnanimous issue of S. Lewes, with so many couragious Princes of his blood, and so many worthy & noble Frenchmen: hath both wisedome, counsell, experience, and the sword wherewith to defende hys royall house, and in iustice to correct the iniury that

hath beene doone vnto him.
            Magitian, thou lookest pale and wan, when I oppose against thee the force of this Sampson, the counsell of this Nestor, the valour of this Achilles, the generositie of this French Prince, with the martiall labours and happy fortunes of this Alcides. Thou flyest (Enchanter) and all thy pollicies faile thee, thy practises, thy poysons, thy parricides, thy incantations, with thy other wicked helps: which can nothing at all preuaile against this rock of constancie, strength and vertue: but feare conuerreth thy winges to thy heeles, and many times hath forced thee to take a shamefull flight.
            Thinkest thou the enclosement of walles, and Rampiers of Citties can warrant thee? tryumphest thou already of two small Townes, which the Spanyards haue taken with such paine and losse of theyr men, as the gaines they made thereof was very little: marie the marks of their crueltie there exercised (according to their nature) meruailous great? Doost thou buckler thy selfe with Fortresses, Cittadels, and one Bastillon? vnable are they to sheelde thee, hauing beene vanquished in field, & glad to flye the battaile with thy newe forces? Wilt thou ward thy selfe with walles, and therein put assuraunce of thy defence? Our Hercules shall pluck thee out as another Antheus, or so shut thee vp with his powerfull Arme, as euen there thou shalt smoother,

and so loose thy life.
            Thou shewest thy selfe to be sencelesse, rauing, mooued with impacience, and stark mad: the fire of thy frenzie makes thee trauaile and torment thy selfe; but these thy very latest behauiours, this heate, furie, frantique feuer and plague, brings thee into a sprightly resolution of thy strength, and so will foorthwith conduct thee to thy death.
            VVhat medicine may serue thee in thys mortall malladie? what hearbe can any way releeue thee, whereby thou maist refortifye thy selfe, and so withstand our valiant Hercules? to what Saint hast thou vowed thy selfe? who shall be thy Aesculapius? what phisicall drugges and simples canst thou helpe thy selfe withall? I vnderstand thou hast gotten a newe Armie of Spanyards, conducted by the Duke of Parma, who feares vs with the renowne of his valour, and the taking of one or two small booties, (he hauing notwithstanding alreadie refused the battaile fiue times, because against so many of the noble and generous French, he durst not be too prodigall of the liues of vile Moores, the Kings euils, and the very base beggers of the Coūtry.) With these barbarous Rodemontes wouldst thou disharten vs, they that gaue succour to the Rebels of Paris, and the Ambassadour Mendoza of Spaine, or, to terme him more rightly, The lyar of Spayne: hee that not long since fled with thy

puissant Armie into Laon, when hee perceiued himselfe pursued by his Maiestie with fifteene hundred horse, ouer-spent and wearied with extreame iournyes: yet perswading thee he wold destroy them all, with so many strange powers, as amounted to many Cornets of Spanyards, who like the forces of Pharao came to swallowe vp Gods people: yet as then ensued, so doubtlesse will he now permit, that they shall be ouerthrowne in the Red Sea, which shall be made of their owne proper blood.
            Thy olde Caballe and couerture of Religion, is as good to thee as nothing, this drugge was long since vttered, and returnes thee no profit: the Catholique Noble men that abhorre thee, doe very well knowe, that heerein is no vertue left to sheelde thee from falling; at thys hooke and line, angling for the estates, thou fastnest sundrie licorish baytes, of Crosses, Miters, Dignities, Prelat-ships, Partages of Prouinces, Offices, Gouernments, and great prerogatiues, which thou promisest to distribute among such, as with thee doe cast the Nets for so rich a Fish.
            The first Fathers of this halfe crowned Iewe, (who to thy proper ruine, and his own aduancement, plucks the hart out of thy bellie) to wit, Atlas, Oris, Anus, Siceleus, Lusus, Vlus, (as then in the Pagan Religion) tooke Spayne by the like bayte, feigning themselues religious, and men of good behauiour; So this olde Foxe,

seeing himselfe readie to succeede his forefathers, hath practised, and doth practise the like in the vsurpation of this Crowne, hoping to make a bootie of it, and to tyrannize therein at his owne pleasure: but that our noble Prince makes him let goe his holde, and surrender vp the estates he proudlie vsurpeth, namely, the Realme and estate of Nauarre, sometime troden down by Ferdinand of Castile and Arragon, one of thy Grandfathers.
            This Ferdinand, vsurped on D. Iohn of Albret, the thirtie fiue King of Nauarre, who espoused Katherine Sister to King Phoebus the thirtie foure, who died without issue, whereby she came to the Crowne, in the yeere one thousand, foure hundred, eyghtie-three. Then Henrie of Albret the second, the Sonne to Iohn of Albret, succeeded in the right of Nauarre, the yere one thousand, fiue hundred, and seauenteene, & espoused Margaret of Fraunce, the Sister to K. Fraunces the first. Of this marriage came Ione, whom Bertrand Helie calleth Charlotte, who succeeded in the right of her Father, the yeere one thousand, fiue hundred, fifty-fiue, and was married to the most puissant and magnanimous Duke, Anthonie of Vendosme, of the most illustrious and royall house of Burbon: whereof is left this Mars in earth, Henrie the thirde of that name, the true succeeder in the rights of Nauar, & now by lawfull succession, the most Christian

and most victorious King of Fraunce, the fourth of that name.
            These effects make knowne thy pretence to the verie ignorant, thy disloyaltie, thy ingratitude, & thy impietie (in many places) hath made the people wise: they know that the dotage and simplicitie of men, is the assured foster nurse of Tyrants. The bountie and clemencie of our King towardes his Subiects, yea, euen his enemies hath, from a great number, taken away the frontlet of ignoraunce; the Christian & Catholique Religion, florisheth more among his faithfull Subiects, then els where, obedience there maintaineth it, where cōtrariwise, such disobedience as thou vsest, hatcheth nought els but rebellion, breach of faith, and lastly vtter ruine and confusion.
            Thy Masque cannot hide thee from beeing noted for a most disloyall and infernall Furie; thou hast brauely extolled thy selfe like a God, thou hast smoothly beguiled the people wyth outward shewe of Religion and holinesse: these make thee known for such a one as thou art, & that thou doost but lye, when thou tearmest thy selfe a Christian and a Saint.
            The mercinarie tongues of thy false Preachers, with all theyr cosenages and impostures, are other sophisticall wares of slender valewe: in that they cannot maintaine thy health, albeit they haue broken and altered the humours of a great

number of thy folowers, to make them like and conformable to thine owne. Who sees not that the Sermons which thou causest them to make, are Phillippicall Appologies, and inuectiues? Where is the Gospell of peace, concord, charitie and loue? Where is the office christian brotherly kindnesse, humilitie, deuotion and obedience? Where is the Christian catechizing, or the exercise of Gods commaundements? Thou by them prescribest a cleane contrary matter, for thou hast hired theyr tongues, to thunder foorth a Gospell of blood, vengeance, disobedience, and rebellion: such Trouch-men and Trumpeters of sedition, haue learned of thee to speake, so to distill into French-mens harts thy golden poyson, whereof already the Rebels feele the bitter taste and deadly operation.
            Thou hast thrust into theyr hands the flaming firebrande, wherewith they haue circled the foure corners and very midst of Fraunce: and all was wel neere lost, without the succour of our Alcides, who ranne to the water, and would not suffer his House and Heritage to be consumed in the violence of thys fire. They haue annimated the simple, (who now are wexen to be deuilish partakers, and tearme themselues zealous Catholiques) to the spoyle, massacre and totall ruine of theyr Parents, freends, and Countrimen, to receyue therefore in the end with them, the earnest of diuine iustice on

the Iibbets and Gallowes: the spectacles and witnesses whereof, are continually before theyr eyes, for theyr notorious crimes and offences. By these kindled fires, hast thou already murdered one King, and by the same pursuest him that now raigneth, that he beeing slaine, and all his race cut off, the estate might be trans-ferred to thy selfe; a horrible & most lamentable case, that Ecclesiasticall persons will pertake in such enormous foule deedes and treasons.

            Thus by Monkes thou iniurest the estate, which thou wouldest dismember, and deuide among those Coniurers, (albeit thy craftie Authour pretendeth otherwise) and thus are the faithfull subiects to the Crowne abused. Vnder

So many abuses & mischiefes hath beene committed by these counterfeit

hypocrites, these scellerous and hooded murtherers: as not without cause, in the yeere one thousand, two hundred and threescore, vnder the raigne of S.

But Guillaume du Temple d' Amour, a Doctor of Sorbonne, (being a man of better conscience then any at thys day of the same Colledge, who create the like instruments of rebellion by their pernicious resolutions, and defende the abhominable murder of the late most Christian and religious King) with other more of great learning: both dispised and disproued openly, such Beggers, alleadging, that theyr pouerty was vowed without cause, and that he would maintaine such manner of life, to be but a pretext of Religion, and onely fit for such The dys

               Ignatius de Layola was the first founder of these Iesuites, (an obstinate enemy to the house of Albret, & which

malice yet continueth in his seede) at what time Pampelunae reuolted, & the affectionate friends to the royall House of Albret, (from whence descended the King, by the late Queene Mother of most worthie memory) with those of Foix, as also the true heire of the Realme Henrie d' Albret: tooke occasion (by the retreit of the Garrisons of Pampelunae, that sallied forth to succour the Gouernours of Castile) by reason of the warres and deuisions then beeing, to haue theyr secrete intelligences in Bearne and Fraunce. In fauour of whom, King Fraunces sent Andrew de Foix, Lord of Asperraut, the younger Brother to Odet de Foix Lord of Lautrech: who gathering vnto him those of the faction of Grammont, tooke the Castel of Saint Iohn at the foote of the gate. Whereupon, the Duke of Nagera Don Anthonie Manrique, seeing himselfe so suddainly surprised, and that the Citty of Pampelunae began to grow tumultuous: secretly got forth thereof, and withdrew himselfe into Castile, leauing his house to the peoples spoyle.
            Thys Layola, then at the dislodging of thys Viceroy Manrique out of Nauarre, remained in Garrison in the Castell of Pampelunae, with other Souldiours belonging to the Emperour. It so chaunced, that the Castel was assayled by the people, and the mouth of the Cannon directed by the assailants to a certaine place: where, by

hap, it met with thys Layola, who had both hys feete brused in peeces with the stones, that the force of the bullet droue out of the wall, so that he fell downe from the height of the Castell, & beeing with-drawne, was afterwarde preserued from death, and hys hurts healed.

Let vs not then account it strange, that these men so desperatly applie themselues to remoouing of estates, especiallie thys heere, considering they are come of a Spanish Father a warriour, a naturall enemy to this estate: whom heerein they follow very perfitlie, but not in change of lyfe.

               Finally my Bretheren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Put on all the Armour of GOD, that yee may stande against the assaults of the deuill. For wee wrestle not against fleshe and bloode, but against Rulers, against powers, against worldly Gouernours of the darkenesse of this world, against spirituall wickednesse in heauenly places.
            
            
               For this cause take vnto you the whole Armour of GOD, that yee may be able to resist the euill daie, and hauing fynished all things, to stand fast: hauing your feete shodde with the preparation of the Gospell of Peace. Aboue all, taking the Shielde of Fayth, where-with you maie quenche all the fierie Dartes of the Wicked.
            
            
               Take also the Helmet of Saluation, and the

Sworde of the Spirite, which is the Woorde of GOD.
            
            These Armes are commendable, & meete for a Christian, and hee is forbidden to vse other materiall Armes, where he goes for Religion and for hys conscience, vvhich are no proper meanes to maintayne and defende them withall.
            And nowe at thys instant comes to my memorie, an example well worthie noting, shewing that Religion ought not to be debated or prooued by corporall Armes; The Hystorie is taken from the faythfull Corriualles of Spayne.

               Acantara, D. Martin Ianes de la Barduba, of the Portugall Nation, entred in quarrell with the King of Granado, about Religion, and woulde make proofe of the trueth of his Religion by Armes. Heereupon, at the motion of a certaine Hermit, vvho had promised hym victorie against the Infidell Moore King, (in despight of the King of Castile to whom he was subiect, and had forbidde him to enter war on this occasion:) he brought an Armie to the Fielde, gaue Battaile to the Moore King, and there by the iust iudgement of God, was worthily punished; For there was he slaine, and hys Armie vanquished, & driuen to flight by the Granadanes.
            
            
               In thys case he vsed no manner of collour or pretence, the trueth was, that he tooke Armes for the maintenaunce of the Christian Religion, and yet neuerthelesse was ouer-come. Then thou, that vnder cloake of Religion hast raised these Armes, and perpetrated so manie sundry euils: what thinkest thou will become of thee?
         
         
            
            That it is not lawfull for a Subiect to Arme himselfe against his King, for what pretence so euer it bee.
            
               IS it not permitted thē (sayst thou) to bandie our forces against an hereticall Prince? Albeit thou hadst such a one, yet is it not for a Subiect to Arme himselfe against his King, and that the Catholique Noble men which follow him, may well gyue thee to vnderstand. Tush, this is nothing els but thy deceit▪ it sits thee well to haue such a colloured pretext▪ although thou hast no hereticall Prince. For the good life and behauiour of his Maiestie, with the desire hee hath to be better instructed without obstinacie, if he were in errour as he is not, exempts him from

that infamous name, and renowneth him wyth the most Christian King.
            The tree is knowne by his fruite: good reason then that thy barbarous actions, shoulde shewe thee to be plunged in the bottomlesse depth of Atheisme. For if thou didst beleeue in GOD, or but loue him: thou wouldest folow his word, and obey thy Prince: what euer he be in hys conscience, he seeketh not to constraine thine. He is a Christian, & most Christian King, further of from the infidelitie and impietie that raignes in thee, then thou or thy helpers, are neere your tyrannous willes to despoile him of hys Crowne.
            I would particulerly aunswer to all thy false inductions, placed in a rancke vnder thys slye pretence: if others (better able then I) had not doone it before mee, wherein there is not anie thing forgotten.
            This is to bee granted, that a soueraigne Prince is not to be violate, and hys Subiects are bound to obey him (whatsoeuer he be:) without doing that which is contrarie to the honour of God. If the King command me to goe to war in his seruice, to mount my horse, and to giue a charge vppon the enemies of his estate: I will doe it most gladly, and am bound in duetie so to doe. If he commaund me to change my Religion: I will not doe it, neither is there any such duetie to be exacted on me. But his Highnesse

is so wise, as he well knowes, that his power tendeth not that way: at his descretion and appointment remaines our bodies and goods, the conscience onely appertaineth to God. He can not force it, and if (perchaunce) he should offer the meanes of Religio

Hauing deuided the French Empire with God: thinkest thou hee will take from him his part, or but enterprise vppon hys estate?
            Hee is no Tyrant to doe so, like thee, that wouldest vsurpe, and teare it altogether out of his handes: but hee shall well enough defende thee, thou hast a puissant and vnconquerable aduersarie against thee, hee that with him hath part of this Empire.

The antiquity of the Royall estate, is most excellentlie noted in the holie Scripture, and recommended in Melchisedech King of Salem, in the tyme of the great Patriarch Abraham, long before Moises.
            
            
               Kings depend and are established by God ouer theyr people: God sayd to the people of Israell; 
                  Deut. 17
                
               When thou art come into the land which the Lord thy God giueth thee, and enioyest it, and dwellest therein, and if thou shalt say, I will sette a King ouer me, like as all the other Nations that are about me: thē thou shalt make him King ouer thee, whom the Lord thy God shal chuse from among the number of thy Brethren, and thou maist not sette a stranger ouer thee, that is not of thy Bretheren.
            
            Since thys Lawe, in the tyme of Samuel, the 
                  1. Sam. 9
                Israelites, desirous to vse theyr priuiledge receiued of GOD: demaunded that a King might goe before them, leade theyr warres, defend theyr Countrey, and venge them on theyr enemies, euen as by all other Nations they behelde the Maiestie royall to florish and be aduaunced. Which by the commaundement of God was graunted to them, wheron succeeded Dauid, chosen according to Gods owne hart, and so continued this dignitie among the Israelites: tyll by the deuision of the people, & diuorce of the auncient Religion, it was tottered and shaken, and afterward in the ende, dissipated and brought to nothing.
            Neuerthelesse, what captiuitie ensued on the people of the Hebrewes; what-soeuer strange Kings were commaunded them: yet had they euermore in chiefe commendation the Royall greatnesse, and were instructed by the

Prophets to obey and pray for their Kings, yea, although they were Ethnickes and Pagans, in so much as GOD had appointed them theyr Lords, during theyr bondage and captiuitie.
            
               
                  1. Peter, 2
                Subiects ought in all feare to submit themselues to theyr Princes, not onely the good and humaine, but those likewise that are stearne & rigorous, for this is agreeable to the wil of God. If any one for the cause of hys conscience towards God, endureth vexation and suffers vniustly, our God in no case will permit the Seruaunt to contend against his Maister, nor the vassayle to take vp Armes against his King.
            But the King (sayst thou) is contrary to thee in doctrine, what dooth thys pretence auayle thee? when were he contrary in doctrine, and as impious and sacriligious as thy selfe: yet it followes not, that iustly thou art to reuolt from him, to make warre vpon him, to attempt hys life, and the spoyle of his estate.
            It is certaine that Saule, for hauing contraryed Gods commaundement, in pardoning the Amalechites, whom he should haue put to the sword: hee was giuen ouer to the euill Spirit, who by times tormented him, and declared him vnworthy of the Realme: Notwithstanding, was it lawfull for any liuing man among his subiects, to enterprise against him? So much wanted it in Dauid himselfe, who coulde finde farre greater occasion to doe it than any other,

not onely pretending to the Crowne, (hauing beene before by the Prophet Samuell annoynted 
                  1 Sam. 1
                King of Israell) but also carrying in memorie the iniuries he receiued of Saule day by day, in recompence of his good and faithfull seruices: albeit he were a fugetiue, he, his father, and all his race: albeit in despight of him, (through cruell indignation) Saule had caused to be slaine, the sacrificing Priests of God, to the number of foure score and fiue, that wore the linnen 
                  1 Sam. 2
                Ephode: besides, discomfited their cittie Nob, & in the same rage slewe with the edge of the sworde, so many men, women, children, yonge sucking Infants, Oxen, Sheepe, and Asses, as were there to bee founde, onely because the hygh Priest Ahimelech gaue Dauid to eate in extreame necessitie, as also deliuered him the sword of Goliah, being ignorant that he had fled the Court, and was in Saules displeasure.
            Although that Dauid was searched through all the corners of Israell, in the Mountains, Deserts, Rockes, and places very neere vnaccessable: although that Saule had appointed & concluded his death, and Dauid hearing this sentence, well knew himselfe to be innocent: although that God had giuen the King into hys handes, and easily hee might haue put him to death. Yet had he no will to touch the person Royall, assuring himselfe, that who soeuer durst be so hardy, what good right to euer he coulde

pretend in the cause: yet should he not stande innocent before the face of God.
            Which well hee witnessed in the Caue of 
                  1. Sam, 24
                En-gadi, and in the Desert of 
                  1. Sam, 24
                Ziph, euen there where soone after Saule was discomfited. For euen as Dauid was hyd in the Rockes of En-gadi, Saule beeing aduertised thereof, tooke three thousand of the most chosen men in all Israell, and so went to seeke Dauid and his men, in sollitarie and vn-habitable places. There Saule causing his men to come before hym, went into a Caue to ease himselfe, and Dauid and hys men remained behind within the same Caue, whē as Dauids people thus spake to him. Nowe is the day whereof the Lorde thy God tolde thee:
               
                  
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , 26
                
               see heere I giue thine enemie into thine hand, and thou shalt doe with him what thou pleasest.
            
            
               Dauid behelde his enemy alone, in a place conuenient, farre enough from hys men, disgarnished of defence, and brought in all poynts according to hys owne wyll. Hee coulde haue smytten hym, without hazarding the meanest of hys people, or without moouing his enemies troupe: now could he haue left the Host a buried memorie of the place wher Saule had withdrawne himselfe, that there should not remaine any tracke of hys entrance or foorth-comming. Albeit he knew by thys deede, he should be deliuered from all hys enemies at once, and aduanced to the Maiestie royal promised him before:

notwithstanding, hee was so farre of from reknowledging the ingratitude and ill will of the King, as secretly hee arose, and cutting a peece of the skyrt of hys garment, beeing yet touched in his hart because he had done so much, he sayd to hys men.
                  1. Sam. 24.
                
               The Lord keepe me from dooing that thing to the King my Soueraigne Lord & Maister, the Lords annointed, let not me lay my hand on his person that is sacred and annointed. For albeit hee is nowe in my power to reuenge my selfe, yet will I not doe that which I knowe is defended and prohibited by God, seeing he is annointed of him.
            
            Thus Dauid appeased the people wyth hys words, and woulde not permit them to ryse against Saule, notwithstanding all the reasons they could alleadge: so that Saule acknowledging his humanity, by the demonstrations he had of Dauid at his comming forth of the Caue, he fell into teares, and thus spake vnto Dauid.
            
            
               Thou art more righteous then I, for thou hast rendred me good, whereas I intended thee euill, and thou hast shewed mee this daie the good thou hast doone me: for asmuch as when the Lord had gyuen me into thy handes, yet thou wouldest not kill me. For who shall find his enemie, and let him depart into a good waie: wherefore the Lord will reward thee with good, for that which thou hast done vnto me this day. And nowe I beholde, and knowe for a certaintie, that thou shalt be King, and the kingdome of Israell shall be stablished in thy hands.
            
            
               Such were the words of Saule to Dauid, beholding the humanitie Dauid had vsed towards him: by which pardoning of hys enemy, he aduaunced hym, and was so farre of from beeing auenged, as hee withdrewe himselfe from his right of raigning in the Kingdome which God had giuen him.
            I cannot omit in thys case another deede of Dauid toward Saule. The Ziphians being come to Saule in Gibea, aduertised him that Dauid was hid in the Mountaine of Hachilah, which was face to face before the Desert of Iesimon. Then Saule renuing hys mortall enmity against Dauid, accompanied himselfe with three thousand able men, and pitched his Campe on the Mountaine of Hachilah.
            Nowe Dauid dwelled in the wildernes, and knew by hys espials that Saule was come neere him; wherfore (in the night) hee came to the place where Saule had placed his Campe, and hymselfe slept within the Fort, hys Tents beeing pitched rounde about him, and very neere him was Abner the sonne of Ner, the chiefe Captaine of hys Armie. Which Dauid perceiuing, discended into that place with Abisay, & approched neere his enemy Saule, when Abisay thus spake to Dauid. 
               
                  
                     
                        •
                      Sam, 26.
                
               God hath closed thine enemie into thy hand this day, now I pray thee let me smite him once with my speare to the earth, and I will not stirre a foote from thee: wherto Dauid answered.

I will not haue him smitten: for what is he can lay his hand on the Lords annointed, and be guiltlesse. And Dauid said furthermore. So truelie as the Lorde liueth, no harme shall be doone him: but rather God shall smite him, or his day shal come to die, or he shall discend into battaile, and there perish. The Lord will keepe me from luying my hand vpon his holie and annointed: but I pray thee onelie take hys Speare that standes at his heade, and his Cruse of water, and so let vs depart.
            
            Thus Dauid contented hymselfe wyth thys brauado: euer-more declaring hym to be no way excusable, that should attempt any thing against the person of the King.
            Let me say beside, that Saule beeing slaine in the fight against the Philistines,
                  1. Sam, 3
                        •
                     
                  
                and Dauid hearing tydings of hys death, was very sorrowfull, and vsed meruailous lamentations: commaunding him to be brought before hym that had cut off his heade, who thought to delight hym with bringing the head of Saule, saying that he had doone him to death, when Dauid, mooued with pitty and anger: How is it (quoth he) that thou wast not afraid to lay thine hand on the Lords annointed?
               
                  2. Sam, 1
                
               Thy blood be vppon thine owne heade, for thine owne mouth hath testified against thee, saying: I haue slaine the Lords annointed.
            
            All the water of the Sea cannot then serue to wash the murderers of the late King, neyther shall any of them be held excusable, that pursue

the life and estate of hys successour, our vertuous and most valiant Prince. But thou alleadgest the Prouerbe common among the barbarous: Si ius violandum est, regnandi gratia violandum est: If right be to be violate, for a kingdoms sake it is to be violate. Wherfore then vsest thou the pretence of Religion and common-good, to ouer-throw the most simple with these deceits? Thys prouerbe is of Tyrants and Atheists, who regard not that God is the reuenger of Kings, and returneth euill to such as enterprise against theyr estates.

                S. Iohn the fore-runner of our Sauiour Iesus Christ, saw in his time Herode Idumean, a counterfeit Iewe, vsurpe the Realme of Galilee and Iurie, he knew the Romaines to be Gentiles and Idolaters, that they had by force not right, depriued the people of Israel of theyr lybertie:

brought them to be tributarie, ordained Gouernours after theyr owne minde, and doone such things against the people of God, as hee myght well complaine on and lament: did he for al that purpose any thing to their preiudice? or teach them to reuolt against theyr Empyre? The Pharisies came to hym for counsell: gaue he them any meane to mutinie against the Romaines? The Souldiours and men of war came to hym, sayd he any thing else to them, but that they should remaine contented wyth their wages?
            Dyd he say to them, that the Romans ought not to raigne, or because it was permitted, that therfore they should rise agaynst them? Moreouer, Herodias molested him, King Herode hated him, because he was not a pleaser of theyr persons; He knew wel that his death was plotted by Phillips wife, dyd hee therefore animate his Disciples to sette themselues against her or Hered? or dyd he practise any meane to escape? Nothing lesse, but willingly entred the pryson, submitted hys necke to the Executioner, offered himselfe to the death: hauing good meanes by hys followers that day by day visited hym, to rayse a mutinie among the people for his deliueraunce. For how should hee haue prepared the

pay tributes, & doe the rest of hys dutie to the Princes of this worlde, albeit they were Pagans and Idolaters.

            He well noted the ambition of the Kings of the Gentiles, saying: they would stand vppon the tytles of gouerning: yet did hee euer animate the people to chase them frō their seates? He knew the cruelty of Herod, the iniustice of Pilate, the auarice and hypocrisie of the Scribes and Pharisies: notwithstanding, he euer-more commaunded to obey them. Dyd he find fault with the Scribes and Pharisies sitting in Moises

            He could with one word haue ouer-thrown them, as sometime hee did the imperious Rulers: he could haue past thorow the middest of them, as he dyd in Nazareth: hee coulde haue made the earth swallowe them, as of olde the mutinous were with Dathan, Corah, and Abiram. Notwithstanding, to leaue an example to such as were his, he esteemed it better to suffer, and councelled rather to flye, then vse violence against the Magistrate.

            Thys charity dyd hee learne of hys Maister Christ Iesus: who kissing the Traytour Iudas, called him friende, and prayed vpon the Crosse for hys tormentors.

            Notwithstanding, who ruled in hys tyme? Was hee a Christian Prince? or any King that looued true Religion? Hee was a barbarous Nero, inhumaine, an Idolater, the most cruell of all the worlde. Dyd the Apostles resist his tyrannie by Armes, although he was not theyr naturall Prince? 
                  Acts, 13
                S. Paule reuerenced Agrippa and Felix, he honoured Lithius the Proconsull: he neuer lifted weapon against the Princes, after

he had rid himselfe of those Armes, which at first he bare against Christ Iesus. Of a Woolfe, he became a Lambe: of a blood-seeker, peaceable: of a sedicious, humble and obedient: of a mutiner, soft and tractable: thys chaunge hee made of himselfe, after he was brought into the yoke of the Euangelicall doctrine. On the contrary, madly these false Apostles, haue throwne off thys manner of life, forsaken Christian Religion, gyuen place to rebellion, enemies to GOD, the Church & Princes: sedicious, robbers, spoylers, murderers, and in all points lyke to the Prince of dissention.

                  Rom, 13,
                but in good. But he that is abandoned to the euill spirit, is ruminating on bad thoughts, prepareth traines for his brother, and by force seeks to lay hold on hys enemy. And in all these actions is not foūd any one more detestable against God and man, then to rise against the person of a King or Prince, to smite or murder him: for he is hallowed and annointed of God, of whom he representeth the maiestie, though he be but a man, and mortal as others are.
            
               Thou vnder-proppest thy hatefull will, to kill thys King as thou didst the last, with the examples of Iaell and Iudith, the first whereof kylled Sisera, chiefe of the Armie to Iabin King of Chanaan: 
                  Iudg. 4,
                he flying to saue hys life in her house, and she perceiuing him a sleepe, tooke a nayle of the Tabernacle, and a hammer in her hand, and so droue it thorow the temples of his head.
                  Iudith, 13,
                The other leauing the Cittie of Bethulia, and brought into the Pauillion of Holophernes, Captain of the Armie to Nabuchodonozer, seeing hym drunke and a sleepe, occasion presenting it selfe, she cut off his head, and brought it away in a bagge by her seruaunt.
            These actes truly were very gracious in these Dames, and worthy of great commendation, in respect they attempted not against theyr King or Prince: but against such as wold ouer-throw the estate royall of theyr Country, and there-against opposed thēselues with all their strength. Do these examples excuse thy villanie & faith-breaking with thy King? In those tymes, Iabin & Nabuchodonozer had no right ouer those people, they came as strangers and enemies against them, (as at thys day thy aliens and confederate Leaguers, come against our King, against his estate, and against his subiects,) and therefore were they so entertained by them.
            But after that God had permitted, that one of them should commaunde his people: what

was he that would not endure it paciently, and (as we haue said before) did not vse prayers in Ierusalem, for Nabuchodonozer & Balthasar his Sonne?

They all haue agreed, that the pretence of Religion what soeuer it be, coulde not giue any collour to a Christian man, to mutinie and rebell against hys Prince, to take his life from him and hys estate.
            They ordinarilie pronounced this sentence, Tertul. in his Apol. 
               Malumus occidi, quam occidere, that they loued rather to be kild, then to kill. For although they were vniustly afflicted by their Princes: rather woulde they submit themselues to the death, then lyft Armes against them. Therfore not to grow tedious to the Reader by prolixitie, I will cease from bringing in the auncient Ecclesiasticall Histories, and testimonies of the Fathers: considering that diuers other haue largely discoursed thereon.
            
               Thou pretendest a collour of libertie and ease of the people, but doost thou therefore bring any remedie? Doost thou discharge them when thou pillest and ransackest the poore, and burnest what-soeuer thou canst not cary away?

All theyr care was, to shew the Princes their faults, and to admonish them of Gods vengeances: not to prouoke the people, and to incite thē to lift Armes against them. And it is not to be doubted, but such as gouerned in theyr time, were well worthy of reprehension: for which cause, Esay in the beginning of hys prophecie, thus deliuered his words to the people of Israell.

            Thus this good Prophet fore-told the iudgment of God against these Princes, and the restoring of the good Iudges and Counsellours: considering that the reprobate were the cause of the euill happened in Israell. A little after, he sayth.

of the Prophets, although they beheld the people to sincke vnder the exactions, as despoyled of all, and brought into pouertie, did at anie tyme, vnder pretence of the Weale-publique, counsell the people to mutinie or rebel against theyr Princes, but rather vehemently perswaded them to pacience.
            Callest thou in question any Pagans, or of the doctrine of Mahomet, or Heretiques, who for maintenaunce and aduauncement of theyr deceitfull & false opinions, haue wickedly conspired against their Princes? Alexander, who was slaine by a Souldiour, that prostrated hymselfe at his feet before the Cittie of Tauris. Amurath, the first King of that name in Turkie, who after hee had discomfited the Despote of Seruia and Bulgaria, was traiterously put to death by a slaue of Bulgaria, who feigned that he came to saue his life. King Sigibert, enuironed with all his people, who at the motion of Fredigonde, was assailed and murdered by two aduenturous Gentlemen. Certaine people of Phenicia, holding the Law of Mahomet, called murderers, otherwise Beduines, dwelling in hollow nookes of the most spacious Moūtains, lyuing vnder a Lord, whom our predecessours knew by no other name, then the Auncient or Great of the Mountain: they vnder imagination of a Paradise of pleasure, which he had perswaded into theyr heades, bare this marke on

them, that they made a sollemne vow to massacre all Princes they could lay holde on, that were contrary to theyr sect and opinion.
            By them was the County of Tripoli put to death, Edward of Englande taken, and many other great Lords, who by them were either slain or held as prisoners. From them came first the word of murder, as whē one cōmitteth slaughter or such like crueltie, by watching for spoile. I knowe that dyuers other raised themselues against theyr Kings and Princes, vnder the couerture of Religion: but I deny that such murderers, (seeing necessarily we must so call thē) were Christian Catholiques, or that for the true faith they enterprised such massacres, so oft and many times condemned in the holy Scripture.

The Tyrant beeing aduertised of the earnest prayer of thys olde Woman, demaunded of her wherfore she did so, and what was her meaning thereby: whereto she thus aunswered. When I was a young Mayden, and our Countrey at that tyme had a verie troublesome Tyrant: I desired hee might die, when not long after he being slaine, there succeeded him another farre beyond him in cruelty. Then thought I, we should be most happy indeede, if we might behold likewise the death of him: but he beeing deade, the thirde Gouernour became worse then both the other. Nowe therfore if you should die, doublesse one more cruell would come in your sted, and therfore I pray that we may keepe you still.

               In thys case then, when so many Romaine Emperours persecuted tirannously the fayth of Iesus Christ, and a great multitude as wel of the Nobles as also the meaner sort, were conuerted thereby to this fayth: they were praised & commended because they resisted not, but endured pacientlie and with courage the death, for the loue of Christ Iesus, as we may see manifestly in the holy Legion of the Thebanes. Shoulde we then rather iudge and esteeme, that Aioth had kild an enemie, then one that was a Gouernour of the people, albeit he was a Tyrant.

But if any people haue right to prouide themselues of a King, and that by them he is chosen: for iust cause, the King so established, may by the people be supprest, or his authoritie taken from him by them that created him King, because so tyrannously hee abused the Maiestie royall. Now are the people to bee iudged vnfaithfull, in forsaking and subiecting thys Tyrant, because before hee was neuer Gouernour of himselfe, neither carryed that faithfull and honourable minde, as is required in the office of a King: Thus misleading and misgouerning his people,

hee deserues not that hys subiects shoulde keepe the promise they made and swore to him.

of his Realme deuided to his two brethren. And because by thys meane hee could not bee kept from vsing tyranny: Tyberius Caesar sent him in exile, to the cittie of Lyons in Fraunce.

They declared such people to be wicked, erronious in fayth and manners, reproouing and condemning them as Heretiques, or scandalous preparers of the way to fraudes, deceites, dreames, periuries, and treasons.
            Thys holy Sinode declared furthermore and ordained, that such as obstinatly affirmed and maintained this doctrine, were heretiques, and ought to be punished according to the holie and Canonicall ordinaunces.
            Then tell me Sorcerer, art not thou an heretique, hauing murdered not a Tyrant, but a iust, debonnaire & lawfull King? Art not thou an heretique, to pursue the life and estate of his admirable successour? whom thou art enforced to confesse & account for a mightie, generous and affable Prince, gracious euen toward his verie enemies, a conseruer of Religion,

although he make profession of that is contrarie to thee. But thou fearest (as it seemeth) that beeing the heade of his Subiects, hee wyll not change his Religion, but rather his clemencie into rigour and seuerity: thys proceeds but frō the fardle of thy malice.
            As concerning the matter of Religion, I haue thereto aunswered thee alreadie: but for the alteration of his kinde nature into another more rigorous, I am perswaded that he is established by GOD to doe iustice to the wicked. Beside, he is so soundly acquainted with mercy and gentlenes, as hee will neuer from them degenerate: but will pardon hys simple Subiects that gaue but consent to rebellion, and were not authours or procurers thereof.

            Art thou a Prophet, or hath GOD reuealed to thee the minde & thoughts of the King? It is not for thee, beeing a seruaunt and Subiect to iudge thy Maister,

                but it appertaineth to the Maister to iudge his seruaunt: thy offences are the cause of thys temerarious iudgement.
            
               A man can haue no better censure of others then of himselfe: for he is of this nature, that he thinkes others doe erre in what himself erreth, so because thou art a lyar and deceiuer of thy King, thou iudgest his Maiestie after thine own affections, and in respect thou art not capable of any good, therefore thou attributest an euill end to all good works, eyther because thou valuest them as nothing, or for the enuious wyll thou bearest to the King.
            The Sunne, whose radiant beames passeth thorow the glasse, receiueth his collour of the same glasse: in like sort, the iudgement which passeth the hart of a wicked man, must needes be wicked, because hys hart is painted wyth a wicked collour: so thy euill opinion of the Kings deedes, proceedes but from thyne owne euill disposition.
            A wande thrust neuer so right into the water, seemeth crooked and broken: euen so thy broken, vicious, and rebellious hart, censureth the sound actions of the King to be broken: as the sicke-man that reiecteth good wholesome meates, and imagineth them to be bitter, because himselfe hath lost his taste.

            So Leaguer, in like manner thou interpretest to an euill end the good endeuours of the King, as also of hys followers and faithfull Subiects. The better sort of people, because they are well minded, iudge euer-more the better way, and wyll themselues excuse the bad dealings of theyr neighbours, so much as in them lyeth to performe.
            
               Ioseph in Egypt excused so much as he could, the mallice of hys Brethren, who enuiously had sold him into that Kingdome, saying to them: 
                  Gene. 45

                Saint Stephen excusing before God the mallice of hys persecutours that stoned him, sayd: they did it through ignoraunce: so to make lesser the faulte of hys enemies. Euen so the mallice or good inclination of each ones hart, is cause of their iudgements good or euill.
            The naturall heate in a man, that is healthfull, of good nature & complexion, consumeth all that he eateth, and conuerteth it into good blood: as by the like example, the man that feareth God, & is enflamed wyth his loue, turneth

what-soeuer he beholdeth to profit therby, but the wicked conuerteth euery thing to euill. A good man giueth credite to all good wordes, (sayth

Charitie thinketh no euill, or misiudgeth of anie one. A good man hath no eyes to looke on the faultes of another: but thou that art wicked, hauing lost both charitie and the vertue of obedience, thou considerest rashlie, thinking others to be sinners, and thy selfe iust.
            Our Sauiour reprooueth thee, where hee sayth:

               Hypocrite, thou seest not the great beame in thine owne eye, but thou well notest the lyttle moate in thy neighbours eye. It is a great matter, that not caring for thine owne conscience, thou art become so busie an examiner and inquisiter of the deedes of thy Superiours, as thou wylt

see and pry into theyr thoughts: wherein thou shewest thy selfe but a foole, that hauing to correct so many faults, by thee committed beeing a Subiect, thou wilt presume to iudge of thy King & Prince, as also hys Seruaunts, whose deedes imploied to a good end, by thee are misconstrued and iudged after thyne owne fancie. In the old Law, God forbad the Priest to iudge presently of the Leper, but to let

                7. dayes first be past. If then God wold not permit the priest to iudge so suddainly of the Leper, whom he manisfestlie beheld: thinkest thou he wyl suffer thee (beeing a Subiect) to iudge of thy King, and of the mallice (which thou sayst) is in hys hart, where-into thou hast no eyes to discerne?
            Thou Leaguer, thou examiner of the hart and thoughts of thy King, remember the chastisement of God on the Bethsamites, because they would needes so curiously looke & search into the Arke of the Testament, as it passed thorow their Countrey:

                God smote to death three-score and ten men of the chiefest sort, and fifty thousand of the common people. The hart of thy King is as the Arke, inscrutable, & much more interiour and secrete are the intentions of a Kings hart and his seruaunts: then were the tables of the Law, the vessels for the Manna, or the rod which was within the Arke of Israell. If then thou weenest so curiously to sift and examine the thoughts & meaning of thy King, being good and iust, yet notwithstanding interpreted

by thee to an ill ende, thou canst not escape the punishment which God inflicted on the Bethsamites: iudge not then rashlie, nor detract thy King. The Apostle saith

               detracters are abhominable before God: then speake wee in general, how much more abhominable are such subiects, as dare detract against their King and Superiours? All these detracters and slaunderers, promise to themselues by their rebellion, a high step into glory; hauing hetherto lyued at theyr ease, on robberies and spoyles made on the faythfull French-men. But ô God! howe farre of are they from theyr account, hauing in hatred the bridge of true repentance, with solemne acknowledgment of theyr offences, ouer which all sinners that are Christians must of necessity passe. What-soeuer good the K. doth, thou art in such sort possest with the spirite of dissention▪ as thou sayst it is no more then a Dreame or fantasie.
            Thou blamest the Catholiques, that they are allyed with such as thou callest Huguenotes, for maintenaunce of the royall authority in the house of Burbon, the most famous of the world. Didst thou imagine them to be so mad, after the slaughter of theyr most Christian King, as to defend the cause of murderers? And then when no question was to be made of the estate, wouldest thou haue them falsely breake theyr bond to theyr naturall & legittimate Prince, to whō

Neuer thinke to make your selues

great by that which you ruinate, but think what shall become of you & yours in such accidents. The difficulties and occurrances that happen in an estate, troubled with affaires of partialities, are the moreful of dangers, in that they depend on what may ensue, and cannot easilie be referred to anie certain rule; so that prouidence must there haue greater place thē knowledge. But the humane spirit is so blinded with selfeloue, and dazeled with things present, carrying shewe of delight: as it imagines such pleasures ought alwaies to endure, and little cares for ought may afterward come to passe: the next way to vse speciall regard heereof, is not to entertaine our thoughts with flattering desseignes or opinions.
            So GOD, who to himselfe hath reserued all power, destributeth no otherwise his gyftes to men, but that often-times hee ouer-throwes their determinations so soone as they are conceiued: and some-times, fore-seeing the scope of mens drifts, conuerteth the enterprise to the ruine of the inuenter.
            Then flatter not your selues concerning the part you take, which is directlie against God, against the estate, and against your King, and so cōsequentlie, to the extirpation of al the French Nobilitie: for the Stranger, accompanied with a multitude of base peasants and groomes, will loose and betray you to the Switzers. If anie one

of the wiser sorte, that attendes on which side the winde will turne, and now are halfe Spanyards, nowe on the Kings side, according to the occurrences, shall say vnto me, that I shew my selfe ouer passionate: I aunswer him, that in generall deuisions, a man ought to take one partie, for otherwise hee shoulde shewe himselfe to be faultie, standing as a Neuter, and so deserue the punishment ordained by Solon for such people. As for me, reason tels me, that I faile not in taking and following the part of my King, whom God hath lawfully and by the degree of succession giuen vs, to gouerne and relieue this poore afflicted kingdome, which doth nothing else but stagger, beeing so extenuate and weake, as if his Maiestie (assisted by God) did not sustaine and restore it, hardlie should she find any other to helpe her with recouerie of health: albeit this is not the first time that Fraunce hath been deuided into Leagues and partialities, after which it hath beene reunited and reconciled.
            For the disease of this estate is so sharpe and violent, albeit the cause thereof is well knowne to all: as if it find not an aunswerable remedie, by the admirable prescription of some speciall and no vulgare Phisition, vndoubtedly immediate death will ensue.
            Which were great pittie (my Lordes) that Rebels should so doe, after they haue mangled, dissipated and spoyled it, vnder collour of reformation,

               It is easie (as Pindarus saith) for the rude & base multitude, to trouble and ouer-turne a great Cittie: but to bring and re-establish it in the former florishing esttae, requireth a little more paine and trauaile. For such onely can doe that, to whom God (as the true Gouernour) giueth the means and counsell how to performe it. The King alone can re-establish Paris, and the Spanyarde, assisted with the Rebels both without & within, gapeth but for the generall ruine therof. The King labours to preserue it, as beeing his proper heritage, and principall seate of the Kinges: the Spanyard imployeth his daily paine for the

losse therof, & accounts it best to vse it as a garrison, a pernicious garrison, a garrison which will be the miserable end of the greatnesse and excellencie of Paris: for whose safety, the King endured before it the discommodities of a long siedge, desiring rather to recouer it by reason, and reknowledging of offences past, thē to take it by force, and so commit it to sack & the Souldiours spoyle.

What man is he so foolish, that will thrust fire into his house, vnder shadowe that it is occupied by his enemies: if he haue the meanes left to chase them away, or to make them become hys Freendes? VVhat Father is it, beeing neuer so greeuously offended with hys Sonne, will therefore immediatly worke his death or destruction? Will he not rather vse discretion, and tarry the time, wherein by necessitie, or other kinde of trauersing, hee may bring him againe into the right way, or acknowledgement of hys fault? In vain were it to doubt otherwise: marrie if the sonne perseuere long time stubborne, and the Father be seuere, in the end he will chastise him according

to his deserts. The King then hath proceeded like a good Father of a familie, hauing vsed incredible pacience and kindnesse, euen till the extremity, when he might haue ruined and confounded all his enemies. God therefore will permit him a double recompence, and if heereafter the Rebelles be handled by his Maiestie more rigorously, themselues thereof haue giuen him iust occasion.
            It is harde to order or well guyde an aduice and deliberation, for reducing a Kyngdome vexed wyth troubles and sedicions, into a sounde assuraunce: as the Pylot (what-soeuer experience he hath,) findes it difficult for him to guide the Shyp, when he is hindered with exceeding rough Seas, and extraordinarie tempests: when he shall be dryuen from hys right course of Nauigation, and see the vessell begin to splyt and shyuer against the Rockes, being vnable longer to man the stearne. But GOD gyueth grace to the King, as a most good, assured, & expert Pylote, to recouer the Barque of the Common-wealth of Fraunce, so menaced and in danger of ship-wrack: to the confusion of all his enemies.

                Paris is brought into such estate, as she may cal herselfe vnhappy, & neere her destruction. The Ecclesiasticall persons, that ought to maintaine this great Citty in peace & concord: they breath forth nothing but bloode and fire sowing no other seed but of dissention, and perswading the people to force iustice, and abuse the Magistrates.
            Consider my Lords, you that haue read Histories, how discorde and partialitie (the cause of sedition and troubles) hath wrought the fall and vnfortunate end of most mighty Empyres and florishing Common-weales, that strange enemies neuer brought them such misery and calamity, as their own domesticall disquietnes: where vnder the countenaunce of Weale publique, liberty, and such like pretences, (euen as the Leaguers do at thys instant) they conspired and compassed the vniuersal ruine of the estate.
            It hath been well noted from time to tyme,

that neuer was any florishing Cittie destroyed by an Armie of Strangers, if first of all she nourished not ciuill warres in her owne bosome: then must it needes follow, that after long ciuill warre, eyther her estate is changed, or els by the stranger, she is brought into a lamentable condition. Doe not your selues heere beholde the like? Paris, is it not already (and that very willingly) in the Spanyards gouernement, vnder collour of deliuerance, seeing it remaineth now at hys deuotion.

Were it not better for you to acknowledge your faults, and desire pardon of the King, who naturally is inclined to mercy? And you my noble Lords, who through misgouernment haue suffered your selues to be carryed away with the passions of the League, shall doe much better to reioyne againe wyth your King and heade, you beeing (as you are) principall members of the estate: whereby at once will be quenched sedition, discorde, warre, & partialities, as also the stranger chased away,

who smiling in his sleeue at our deuisions, by these bad affaires returneth himselfe good profit. I beseech ye consider what Plato saith

               Ciuill war is nothing els but sedition, a capitall & pernicious plague to the Common-wealth, which infecteth with the contagion thereof, all the partakers therein: and most commonly it proceedeth of couert and small occasions, like vnto a pyning Ague, which beeing not at the first perceiued, and by medicines preuented, consumeth the body by little and little to iust nothing. This ciuill warre is then the more dangerous, in that it is enterprised against the King and the estate, vnder a false pretence: which will cause, (if you open not your eyes, & God vouchsafe to holde strong hande with the true and holy intent of the King) such ciuill spoyle among our selues, as wee shall be made forreiners in our owne Country.
            For thus will the Spanyard (if he can) deale with ye in the end, set foote vpon your throates to rid himselfe of you, and then will make warre on ye: not as a freend or confederate, but as an enemy both to one and other; Not as a Protecter, or Deliuerer (as the foolish rebellious people vainlie tearme him) but as a proude Vsurper and blood-thirstie Tyrant. Can ye thinke his cōming into Fraunce is for any other intent? If ye dreame on any other friuelous opinions, ye but abuse your selues. Preuent then in good tyme this slye deceitfull Spanyard, beate backe

his stratagemes with other of more honor: for if ye with-hold your selues ouer-long from asswaging this discord, which is daily and hourelie aduaunced by your mortall enemie, that already leades yee with him as captiues in tryumph: ye shall find it as hard to get any remedie or helpe, as to heale the Feuer Ethique, that hath got the maisterie in a languishing bodie.
            This rebellion hatched so long time by the practises and deuises of the Spanyard, who alreadie vaunteth that he hath yee in possession, and (as it were) tyed fast in his snares: is euerie hand-while mooued and enflamed, as

There is such mixture of defiances, as nothing is ingendered but hate, suspition and priuie dissembling: so that all honestie, all Fayth and humilitie, is vtterly forgotten and violated, and true reconciliation euer-more hindered.
            
            All things amongst Rebels are very miserable, yet if there fall out any thing to their own desire: nothing is more miserable then such a successe, as not onely makes them to be more arrogant and vntractable, but rather entertaines or nourisheth them more & more in mischiefe.

               De Maine must doe all things by the aduise and will of the Spanyards, although by them he pretends to conquer? Marie, the Duke of Parma, he is too fine to serue them as a Seruaunt, he rather wold vsurpe for himselfe (if he could) a cruell and tyrannicall gouernement: to maintaine himselfe by force, ouer-throw the Noblemen of this Country & afterward, beate down the people with feare and terrour.
            VVill not you then take aduantage offered against these Rebelles? If yee loue your King and Countrey, as I thinke ye doe, lay hold

yet on the vallour of your Auncestors, who valiantly repulsed the Spanyard when hee would haue entred Fraunce, & made a famous slaughter of all his followers. Consider the vnfortunate fal & ruine of the ancient estate of Greece, & very latest Empire therof, of Carthage, Rome, Italie, and infinite other Common-weales, kingdoms and Signories, which onely happened by partialities and deuisions.
            
               Phillip de Commines heereof wrote well and truelie.

               Such dissention and discordes (saith he) are verie easily sowne amongst rebellious people, and they are a true signall of the ruine and destruction of a Countrey or Kingdome, when they take roote therin, as they haue doone in diuers other Commonweales and Monarchies. And to thys purpose, (if I were not well assured, that the mallice and ambitions of the rebellious Leaguers, rather thē destenie, is the cause of the desolation of thys estate) I could say, as Salust sometimes saide of Rome.

                  . 
               I am perswaded, seeing all things that had beginning must haue end, that then by destinie, the ruine of Rome shall approch: when the Cittizens fight against the Cittizens, and so beeing spent and weakened, shall be exposed as a pray, to some King or strange people: otherwise, all the Nations of the world assembled together, cannot ouer-throwe this Empire. But any man, (not sinisterlie carried awaie) doth euidentlie perceiue, that the originall and source of the downe-fall of this estate,

except God set his hand to in time: ariseth frō the rebellion of these Leaguers, so long time practised by the Spanyard and his adherents.
            To escape then from so great an euill, withdrawe your selues (my Lords) to this partie, reconcile your selues to your King and relieue your Countrey, exposed by the Rebels as a pray to the Spanyard, who hath no little while beene plotting and practising this deuice for his purpose. Demosthenes fore-seeing the ruines of Greece, (through the vnderminings and policies of Phillip King of Macedon, who kept it in deuisions, not only Cittie against Cittie, but the Cittizens deuided against each other in euery Cittie, by corruppting the chiefe Gouernors that were drawne to take part with him:) imployed all his paines to reconcile the Athenians and other people of Greece, from such dangerous factions, and to regard the maintenance of their estate. For my selfe, I haue not the eloquence of Demosthenes wherewith to perswade yee, but this I plainely giue you to vnderstand, that an other A

               Phillip, King of Spayne, hath vsed the like deceits in Fraunce, wherby to spoile and ruinate the Countrey, as Phillip King of Macedon did in Greece, to make himselfe Lord thereof.
            Fly my Lordes, fly this partialitie, cause of so great troubles, pernicious to the publique societie and priuate kind of life, euermore readie to

hurte, and which bringeth no meane damage, according to the occasion and occurrences of the time, your selues do daily behold the effects heereof, for the Armie of the Leaguers beeing hemde in with this partiall Monster, as well among the French-men as the Spaniards; it will come to passe, that without any great labour bestowed by the King, their owne deuision wyll both frustrate their enterprises, and hinder the victorie they liue in hope to haue: euen as it happened in the battaile of Cannas, where the Romains lost the day, thorow the partialitie of the two chiefe Leaders, Paulus Aemilius and Terentius Varro.
            
            I cannot thinke that the Duke De Maine and the Duke of Parma, the onely commaunders of the League, will agree long time together, but that the one must giue place to the other: for the Spanyard is too braue & arrogant, to holde yoke with the French Rebels, hauing occasion so fayre and fit for the purpose, whereby to gette the maisterie ouer them now or neuer. My Lords, you that are faithfull Gentlemen and Seruaunts to the King, me thinks thys one cause should induce a good accord and vnion among ye, for the seruice of his Maiestie, & that ye shoulde be both iealous and enuious of the charge and honors distributed by his highnes, not to haue thē trans-ferred to such as are so farre vnder you in woorthinesse: and vnlesse

this fire of iealousie kindle the sooner in yee, it will redounde to the great disaduantage of the publique affaires, and your own proper ruine. As for the rest of you my Lordes, that side it with the Rebels, wrap not your selues in theyr offences, loose not your selues altogether in the heape of theyr discords, nor yet forget, that you but defend their perfidie & impietie: in so myserable a confusion, forsake such part-taking.

The times were then so full of calamity and miserie, the French being afflicted with warre, famine & pestilence so cruelly, as the Fieldes were long time fallowed and vnmanured, the Citties ransacked, the houses and Fortresses, ruined, destroyed and burned, the great Lordes and loyall Officers of the Crowne, the most worthy, heroyick & valiant personages kilde, massacred or banished: then was iustice prostituted and brought into bastardie, merchandise and publique negotiation abolished; In breefe, all religion and humanitie violated, & for certaine yeeres was so great a mortalitie in Paris, as the Woolues could not

be kept out, but entred the Cittie, and deuoured the dead bodies. Are we not now in danger to beholde the like times? If the French Rebels get not some whol-some Elleborus, and become wise by the remembrannce of passed examples: well may they doubt to see farre worse troubles.
            For the violence of this warre (so long time closely practised and intended) tooke beginning by excesse of treasonable offences, and afterward proceeded by murder of the King: the progresse and end cannot but presage, but to be worse then the warres I haue alreadie alleaged.

               So soone as anie noueltie or insolence is vnderstoode to be committed in a Cittie, there are such as

presently practise howe to make it worse: prouoked (moreouer) to enterprise new stratagems, eyther to declare themselues more insolent, or for their burning desire to be reuenged. And what-soeuer euil is doone, they haue arteficiall names to disguise it withall, which (for their excuse) they change into contrarie signification, as if they were no such matters as they call them. For they tearme rashnesse, to be hardinesse and magnanimitie, so that such sudden fellowes, are called valiant defenders of theyr freendes. Softnes or temporising, they name honest feare: modestie, couert cowardlines: violent rage, couragious resolution: wise and discreet deliberation, cloked dissimulation. So by these meanes, he that is most vehement and audacious, is reputed faithfull, and (as they say) verie zealous, and wel affected to the cause: and he that wil not ad-here to thē, is held suspicious.
            
            
               As for him that brauely executes their enterprises and reuenges, he is a wise and able man: but much more he, that knowes best how to fore-see and discouer the intent of his enemie, and prouides that no man on his side shall depart from the faction, or stand in feare of the Resister. In breefe, who most readily out-rageth or offendeth others, is praised, but especially, he that can induce another to execute his determinations. Such a faction is farre greater among strangers, thē freends or kinred, because they are disposed to all enterprises, without any excuse: euen so, conspiracies and assemblies, are not doone by

authoritie of the Lawes, or for the weale publique, but for auarice, against all reason: and the fayth kept among such, is not for Religion (as they would haue it seeme) but to entertaine such contagious euill in the Common-wealth.
            
            
               Thucidides declared, that such was the valour and courage among these partialists, as the one party thought nothing that proceeded frō the contrary faction, and altogether tended to no other end, then the extermination and destruction the one of the other. As for anie appointment or reconciliation made with theyr sollemne oath, there was very slender assurance in their words, when they had neyther feare or reuerence in an oath: because they wold keepe them no longer, then while they found occasion to lay hold on theyr aduersaries, or some-what returned to their own aduantage.

Each one in words debated the defence of the Common-wealth, but theyr deedes did witnesse the contrary: because that without hauing any regarde to the common-good, they laboured but to satis-fie their owne greedines, making profit of others spoyle, & executing vengeances as themselues pleased.

where because he was affected to neither side, or the enuie of them to see him in quiet, he was thrust into the euil which the other suffered.

In such ciuill diuisions, the mishaps are so great, that without cōsideration of good turnes and benefites receiued, or the vertuous actions of excellent men: the people so furiously cast themselues vpon them, as they cease not to pursue them, euen to death or banishment. As it happened in Athens to Themistocles, Aristides, Demosthenes, and Phocion: in Rome, to Coriolanus, Camillus, Scipio Affricanus, Cicero and others.
            Beholde ye not my Lordes, you that should see more cleerely thē the rest, euen a like forme of estate among these Leaguers and Rebels? Will yee not acknowledge it to be an extreame disorder and insolence?

soule and bodie, and that in the soule is bestowen the seed of the diuinitie, which ought to be receiued, tilled, and husbandred by reason, to the ende it may bring forth fruite according to the seede: yet is not the culture or husbandry in all men alike, but there is found a great difference betweene their spirits: so that in some it appeareth, that the diuine seed poured and thrown into a barren field, is eyther smoothered and lost, or taketh so weake roote, that it cannot prosper and increase. Such is the varietie & difference among men, as some for the exercise of reason and vertue, are more noble, valiant, and

            GOD established Superiours to commaund, and made the other to obey, the one estate worthy of honor, the other, not to presume so high: as the Potter (according to the Apostles

words) of one selfe same matter maketh a vessell to honor, and annother, seruaunt to meaner things.

               They are sharpe, hardie and valiant, & the first of them, next Hercules (who therfore was admirable & reputed immortal) reached the height of the inuincible Alpes, they beeing not passe-able by reason of the cold, and managed sundry battailes, hauing vanquished the people of Pannonia, vvhich at thys day are called Austria and Hungaria. Ah open your eyes my Lordes, and come to your Prince whom you ought to acknowledge, consider what before I haue declared to yee out of the word of God, to bring again the strayed & rebellious people in obedience to their King.
            Heerein ye may perceiue, that a Subiect cannot find or pretend any occasiō to rebel against his King▪ notwithstanding any cause what-soeuer it be. But perhaps thou wilt tell mee, that in the warre for the Weale-publique against King Lewes the eleuenth, certaine of the chiefest sort entred Armes, moued with a discontent against

the King, because they were not honoured and recompenced as their deedes had deserued: yet he gaue to such as were vnworthy, men vtterlie vnknowne & of small acquaintance.
            They reconciled themselues to theyr King, and did not as these Leaguers doe, who vnder collour of reconciliation, troubled the estate, & in the ende bereft the King of lyfe. And that which is most horrible to speak, and scandalous to men of sound Religion, they practised wyth an vnhappy Iacobine Fryar, making him the instrument and Executioner, of theyr accursed conspiracie and monstrous crueltie. As for the other thou talkest of, they only were but Male-content, as they wel declared by their appointment and reconcilement with their King: but these Leaguers, breaking all order and pollicie diuine and humane, after they had proditoriously by a trayterous Fryer, or rather a very deuill of the Cloyster, massacred & murdered the late King: would change the estate, or as the truth is, they would transport a stranger out of one house into another. Haue not these Leaguers despoyled the good nature of the auncient French Nation, vnnaturally to participate with the treason of the Spanyards? And if they tearme themselues good French-men, looke on their pernicious damnable complots, against the King, and the estate of Fraunce. Doe they not apparantly be-lie Iulius Celsus, who thus speaks

of the French-men in his fift booke.

How can these Leaguers then by any right, attribute vnto themselues thys faire and excellent French title: seeing they are Rebels, enemies to the Countrey, and Traytors to the estate they should most labour to preserue? Doe not all Nations of the earth detest the perfidie of Rebels against the Maiestie royal, which is the image of the Diuinitie, the King being Lieutenant & Vicegerent of God, in the kingdome which he hath put into his hande?

            See yee not also my Lords, that God (who is iust) doth dailie pursue them with vengeaunce and punishment, by the fidelitie of so many generous and magnanimous Princes of the blood

royall of the house of Burbon, that onely remaineth heyre to the Crowne, besides, with so many great Lords of Fraunce, so many Gentlemē, and all the good and loyall French-men? You likewise, that are issued of Fathers so vertuous and faithfull to the Crowne, who (for the most part) made prodigall expence of theyr bloode, for the defence of thys most royall estate: see ye not now how a stranger would rauish and carry it away?
            Will ye be so blinded, as to imploy your forces in so bad a cause? Are ye so vnnaturall, as willingly to betray your King and Countrey? Will ye turne your backes in so true and iust a cause, and subiect your selues to the iniurious rebellion of the Leaguers? The other Lordes and confederates of this Crowne, are mooued with vs, and resolued to pursue such monstrous iniustice: will you then be so blinded & deceiued, with the false inducements and perswasions of the League, as to maintaine the ruine and ouerthrow of the estate, and of your owne selues likewise?
            Ah that it might please yee, to lende your eares a while to this my simple and not deceyuing declaration, perhaps some one of you, being touched either with hate, enuie, or some other discontentment, or the bond of affection he beares to the chiefe of the contrary part: vvill enter into consideration, that he cannot do this,

without blemish to his honour and reputation, which hee ought to esteeme more deere than any thing else, so that rather then he will consent to such a detestable rebellion, & generall spoile of his natiue Country, the loue wherof he ought to preferre before all other vaine passions: hee will imitate the example of worthy A no

But although GOD permitteth, for our correction, and proofe of the auncient constancie and fidelitie of the French, that these leagued Rebels should afflict and ouer-trauaile vs: yet his iustice will neuer suffer, that they shal confound or tread vnder foot, the estate Royall, or to dispose it where they please, hauing placed and established it for so many ages, in the royall Lynage of S. Lewes. But in the end he will take vengeance on their crimes, treasons, periuries, murthers, with other horrible disorders and shames, giuing them as a pray, euen vnto those people, whom now they holde as theyr great friendes and confederates: the worst is, The Spa

            Some subtill cunning Rebell, as a collour or shaddowe to such disloyalties, will saye vnto mee. That all thinges are subiect to alteration and change, and there is nothing that perpetually continueth in one selfe same estate, for heauen it selfe is not exempt from change and ending. I aunswer, that I am very certain of this

alteration, likewise that there is a course of ages and dispositions of things in the world, as in our humaine body: to wit, after they are borne, they haue their infancie, child-hood, and state of a yonge stripling: then they increase in manly strength, and so continue a while in force and vigor: afterward they become aged, declining, and in the end perishinge. For this is a maxime in Phisique, that all thinges composed by generation, are dissolued by corruption, and the ende of the one is the birth of the other. Such variety and change commeth not onely to priuate men, who declare sufficiently these effects, by the mutabillitie of their desseignes and enterprises, suffering themselues to bee carryed away with nouelties, that makes a confusion of their wits, and in the ende is their vtter spoyle; but likewise to Families, who at the instant when they imagin they haue freely builded their fortune, and tryumph in the conceit of their owne greatnesse: they behold their present fall, and all their foundations throwne on a heape together.
            I knowe likewise, that Empires, Kingdomes, Signories, & the most flourishing estates, are no lesse exposed to remoouings, varieties, & changes: as it may seeme a naturall reuolution, that oftentimes makes the state of a Cōmon-wealth to change and rechange. But what is the cause of the change that thou wouldst make? Is it not the change of thy manners? of thy fidellity into

disobedience? of thy milde and gentle nature, into audacious behauiour? of thy loyaltie, into breach of faith: of thy duetifull office of a true subiect, into all loose libertie and licenciousnes? Is it not ambition and greedy desire to reigne, that in this sort transporteth men of high courage, being madded with their enterprises, that without feare and reuerence of Religion, (which dooth defend them from such tyrannies) or care of their faith and loue to their Countrey, they striue to attaine the soueraigne place of commanding? couering themselues with the maxime of

                Masculine) then thys whereof wee

now speake: if wee should searche all Monarchies both auncient and moderne.
            I confesse that sometimes happeneth the alteration of Monarchies, namely by the diuine permission, and that they are trans-ferred from one house to another: but heerein I yeeld not, that God will haue the change made by disloyaltie, breach of fayth, and treason, committed by subiects against theyr Prince, to whom he hath commanded them expresly to be obedient. For the King is the annointed of God, and who-soeuer resisteth the King (as I haue amply declared in the seconde part of this discourse, by the authority of holy Scripture) resisteth God, the establisher of Kings and Princes on the earth, to gouerne in his sted. And if it so fall out, that subiects by force or violence, attempt the estate and life of their King: they doe against the ordinaunce of God, and earely or late they shal be chastised. Hence then it came, as I haue breeflie touched, that the Carlingians, hauing perforce helde the Realme against the Merouingians, by the Armes of Pepin a stranger prince: God pleased that the Crowne should return by Hugh Capet, of whom our Kings are discended to this present day, in the race of the Merouingians, who therof was a while vniustly frustrated.
            Will yee then permit (my Lordes) that our King Henrie the fourth, a branch of the Merouingians,
               
by Hugh Capet, and S. Lewes of the selfe same race, should be depriued of the succession which appertaineth to him in right and iustice: Will not you assist him against such as seeke to hinder his peaceable possession? Are ye so weake of minde and spirit, as to let him be smitten and conquered by his enemies, without giuing the assitance you owe him of duetie? Take ye such delight in your owne ruine, as it stirres ye not, when the stranger treades your state vnder his feete, but you drawe your weapons to helpe him to his enterprise? Knowe ye not that alteration in all things, but chiefelie in these publique affaires, is most dangerous?

The other Lords were thrust in prison or banished, passing the remainder of theyr liues very miserably in strange Coūtries. In the end, the two Houses being vnited by the marriage of Henrie the seauenth, with Elizabeth daughter to King Edwarde the fourth, all these troubles ceased.
            
               See the hurt that ensueth by such deuisions, what more strange matter are wee then to expect in such a huge rebellion as this is of the Leaguers? Find you it any way reasonable, that the true and naturall successour of the Crowne, shold endure any other to call his right in question, & by force of Armes to take it from him, that is the most hardie & valiant Prince on the earth: and who hath learned to haue his Armour oftner on his bodie, then the habit royall, or the pompe and seruice that other Princes haue which lyue in quiet?
            It is the common cause of all Monarchies, to maintaine against the Subiects the estate of a iust and lawfull King, and you beeing Noble-men, that holde assuraunce of your noblesse, goods and faculties of your King, will not you maintaine the same against his Subiects and rebellious enemies?
            The Lawe and custome of Fraunce receiued at the first establishing of the Kingdome, dyd alwaies refer the Crowne to the next Male issue of the blood royall: our Kings then heerin beeing giuen vs by nature, mee thinkes there is no reason that any occasion shoulde remooue our estate. The Crowne is seated in this so ancient, illustrious and royall House of Burbon, next succeeding that of Valoys, discended of the linage of Orleance.

               Charles Dolphine sonne to the King: beside the exheriditation his Father made of him, depriuing him of succession in the kingdome, there was a certaine iudgment giuen against him, in an assembly held at Paris, wherby he was exiled & banished the Realme, beeing declared vnworthy there to succeede. On this vniust iudgement, he appealed to God and hys sword, when the iustice of his cause beeing assisted by the inuincible power of GOD: the Crowne was preserued for him, and hee established with very wonderfull victories thorow all all his kingdome, from whence hee chased the Englishmen, beeing reconciled to the Duke of Burgundie, and deceassed, to the great griefe of all his Subiects, leauing them in good peace & quiet.
            Whereby you may perceiue, that albeit euery one was set against the true heyre to the Crowne, yea, the Father himselfe: yet God in his admirable prouidence, woulde not permit, that the kingdome should be trans-ferred from the race and linage of S. Lewes, neither is it to be doubted, that his grace preuenting, with the deuoire of all good and faithfull French-men: but that it will be continued to all his posterity, whereof this most famous and royall House of

               Burbon, is the very neerest and onely heyre to the Crowne.
            What cause then is there to prolong these ciuil warres & troubles for the estate, seeing we haue the legittimate successour? Ah, nothing els but absurd and monstrous ambition. But some zealous Rebel tels me, that he is an Heretique: tush, these are old stale lyes, thys poynt, if he were so, seeing he demaundeth and offereth to be better instructed, is not as yet discided.
            To be an heretique, (as els where I haue said) is obstinately to holde an opinion concerning Religion, and rather to die then to forsake it. Seest thou in our King any such headdie or obstinate resolution? Howe many times hath hee giuen thee to vnderstand his ready will and intent? Moreouer, this is no argument and good consequent: The friu

               The King is not of our Religion, therefore hee is dishabled from succeeding in the Crowne. Thou argumentest very ill, & not like any good Logitian. The debate thou vrgest for the Crowne, makes a greater breach & blemish into Christian religion, then if willinglie thou didst consent & giue him place, as in dutie thou art bound to do: seeing that right, neither thou or hee can hinder from him to whom it appertaineth, which thou hast neither eyes to behold, or wit to conceiue. If heerin thou mightst preuaile, couldst thou be tearmed a good Christistian? that flyes and abhors as a plague the ininfamous

note of rebellion, yea, fosakes landes, goods, wife, children and all, to follow his King. That tearme thou maist returne vpon thy selfe, though now thou callest his Highnesse followers, pollitiques and heretiques, as pleaseth thee to baptise thē: notwithstanding, they are more assured of their fayth then thou art, and better Chritians then any that take part with thee.

            But you Rebels (that are too much at your case) will not acknowledge your King, who so many times hath protested to ye, to preserue & maintaine ye in your estates, and in the Christian Catholique Religion, (vnder a shadow, saist thou) himselfe not beeing a Catholique. Doost thou know the inward of his words & purpose? Is there any one can say, that euer he falsified his fayth? Hee hath sollemnely sworne to defende the Catholique religion, as his proper life: thinke then if it should be hindered, although he neuer will goe against his owne commaundement,

You rather ought to pray to GOD with vs, that he will graunt him grace stedfastly to embrace the Catholique religion, & to plant it heere mildly, by reason and not force, violence or fyre: likewise to loue and esteeme so many valiant good French of contrary opinion, that sell not (as our zealous Leaguers doe) theyr King and Countrey to the Spanyard. It is not by blood and death to winne mens consciences, but by the doctrine, proofe and good example, which greatly wanteth in your false Apostles.
            I beleeue there is not any Christian Catholique, a faythfull member to the Crowne, but would earnestly desire, that the King, (enriched with such store of vertues, required in so great a Prince as he is) shold likewise be a Christian Catholique, to the end, that as we ought to haue but one King, so wee might also haue but one fayth and Religion, wherein, as in the feare of God, our Prince earnestly labours to haue vs liue. Heereof not only the Philosophers and Christian Doctors, but also Emperours are assured witnesses, by many constitutions recited

as well in the Ecclesiasticall hystories, as also in the bookes of Theodosius & Iustinian, who greatlie trauailed to maintain the vnion of the Christian Catholique Church. When there is vnitie in religiō in an estate, who doubts but al things do prosper the better?

               Religion is a constant vertue, teaching the true adoration of God, which is done with an intire spirit: and the vnity thereof is figured by the garment of Christ Iesus, wouen without a seame, that it was not to be cut or deuided. This is in truth, a faire assembly of such as are knit in one brotherly vnanimity & consent, as well in religion as policie: whereof the Prophet Dauid singeth, beeing assured that to such, God wil send blessings, and lyfe euerlasting.

There is but one Catholique Church (sayth S.

            We desire nothing more, then that the King (according to the most Christian tytle of hys Predecessors) and his people shoulde be vnited in Christian Religion, as for preseruing peace in his Kingdome, he is declared the Defender and Protector of the Catholique Religion: with protestations so oftentimes reitterated, so to preserue it as his proper life. Nor is he ignorant what Cicero sayth: That Religion beeing troubled, the whole Common-wealth is troubled, because the disquiet and change that happeneth therein, dooth nothing else but cloy the spirites of men with disorder and confusion: whence proceedeth contempt of Gods true worshippe, and hee beeing offended, punisheth and afflicteth with diuers woundes and calamities, the Countrey that is fallen into such a miserie. This therfore his Maiesty wold fore-see by his wisdome, desiring that Religion shoulde bee preserued,

euen as (before God) the gouernment of the estate is put into his hande. God hath giuen vs such a one, adorned with so many heroycall vertues, as makes him admirable to all Nations of the world: Would you then haue vs goe ranging about, and vrge a beleefe contrarie to that we doe beleeue? Is it possible we should doe so? Faith is the gift of God, and is not imprinted in mens consciences, by stroakes of swordes, or any other weapons: it is necessary that the spirit of God should be in quiet: all the harts of men, especially of vs that are his subiects, would herein dye and be consumed. Of necessitie is it, that this grace commeth from aboue, and we can do no otherwise, but pray to God for his Maiestie, and that he will graunt vs to be still mindefull of our dueties, hee is our King, wee ought to obey him, and he ought to preserue & maintaine vs, according to the Laws & statutes of the Countrey, as all other Kings hys predecessours haue doone.
            But what shalt thou gaine by desiring the thing thou doost? I beleeue, that if the King were such a Catholique as thou wouldest haue him, and for one Masse, he should dispose himselfe euery day to heare two: yet the Rebels would say no lesse of him, then they did of the late King, that he did it for hypocrisie, and to be quiet in hys estate. What can we else iudge? seing their intent is to exterminate his life, with

all the generous and royall linage of Burbon, to follow the seruice of a Stranger. But (as I haue sayde) GOD hath euer-more preserued that race, euen for sixe hundred yeeres and more, to this present: and yet by hys holy will stil continues it, for the good & quiet of this poore distressed kingdome.
            These Armes that you haue taken against him (ô Rebels) will turne to your owne ruine and confusion, seeing God forbids ye so to doe, what-soeuer pretence ye make of Religion. Religion should moue ye to pitty and not to rage: to compassion, and not furie: to loue & regard of your King, and not to rancour or hatred: to a naturall French-affection of hys seruice, and not to an obstinate will, to wound, destroy, and take his life from him, if ye could.
            Now say my Lords and Gentlemen, if yet ye haue not sufficient manifestation, that euen against Tyrants, Religion cannot serue for anie cloake or collour? The Spanyard, hath not he declared so much, who tearming himselfe in Fraunce, Protector of the Catholique Religion, hath not hee (neuerthelesse) suffered Paganisme in many places of Granado, Andalozia, and Arragon, for the great

                   it. profit hee got by it many yeeres together? Will ye not yet bethinke your selues, what good affection the Spanyards haue (of old) borne to the French? Did they not (no long time since) kindly intreate thē at Florida:

where they pluckt out theyr eyes, to make them die the more miserably? Their drift is, to bee Commaunders ouer ye, and if you haue goods and faire wiues, to put you and your heyres to death, to possesse your wiues and your goods: as they haue practised the like in Flaunders, Naples, Millaine, and in euery place where they by force doe domineere. It is the Crowne, it is the Crowne that all this debate is for, although we hauing (as I haue proued) a lawfull succeeder, there cannot be gathered any occasion for such a debate.
            VVhen heere-to-fore there happened anie such like strife, they had recourse to the estates of Fraūce: as it chanced after the death of Lewes the 10. called Hutin, that the Crowne was adiudged to Phillip le Long his brother. And after Charles le Bel to Phillip de Valloys his Cousin, against Edward king of England, who pretended the cause of his Mother, the daughter of Phillip le Bel, & sister to the last three kings: but there she had no right, by force of the Salique Lawe, which excludes the daughters of Fraunce from any succession. It is now no question of holding the estates, in this regard, seeing no one maketh doubt, but that the Crowne appertaineth to Henry of Burbon, by whō, for his race & admirable perfections, with his happy fortunes in war, amidst so many trauerses: the estate receiueth more honor, being gouerned by such a king, thē
               
the King dooth of the estate, which comes to him by succession, as beeing the very neerest heire to the Crowne.
            Then you braue Lordes and Gentlemen of Fraunce, whose famous Grandfathers defended this Kingdome by their vertuous strength, and made their glorie wondered at through the world: spend not your valiant & noble blood to your eternal destruction, but as your spirits are rockes of far more excellent perfection, so seeke such waies as are more worthy and cōmendable for ye. To bring again this estate, with the whole body of the Nobillity, who haue euer stood with the King, & from whom through false impression your selues are dismembred: into her former splendour & honorable quiet. Vnite your selues to your king your soueraigne Lord to extirpate this rebellion, and chase hence your entertained euils, the Spanyards, your auncient and mortall enemies: thereby to bring and re-establish this poore afflicted Realme, into such peace and tranquillitie, as all good mindes desire, and is promised by your generositie & force, with the grace and blessing of God: who I pray to open your eyes, to let you wade no further in the loue of thys vnlawfull League, that like a subtill Thais, is prouided of a thousand baytes and sleights to catch yee withall. But if ye continue in her seruice, ye shall find your selues betweene two stooles, wher-through (as the Prouerbe is)

the taile falles to ground: and too late repentance, with most pittifull end, will be the recompence of your pernicious pursutes, and the dishonest pleasures you haue had with her.
            Followe, followe then the steppes of the most magnanimous and valiant Princes of the blood, so many great Lordes, Marshalles of Fraunce, Dukes, Earles, Marquesses, Barons, and Gentlemen of marke, the number wherof is infinite and innumerable, al which expose them selues and their deuoire, for the seruice of hys Maiesty, the reliefe of the estate, to preserue you (if ye forget not your selues) in your goods, priueledges, and immunities, seeking nothing but the quiet and prosperitie heereof.
            God giue them grace, and you likewise, to make some profit of this fore-warning, to the end, that wee hauing occasion more and more, to bee thankefull to the King for his infinite bountie, & those faithful subiects that attend on him: the celestiall fauour and assistance accompanying the Kings power, your amendment and reconciliation, may turne to the happie successe of these publique affayres, the rest and re-establishment of thys disolate Kingdome.
