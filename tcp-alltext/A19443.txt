            Drawen out of the holy Scriptures, By Roger Cotton.
            
            
               
                  Psal. 37.12.
               
               The wicked practiseth against the iust, and gnasheth his teeth against him.
            
            
               
                  Psal. 37.13.
               
               But the Lord shall laugh him to scorne, for he seeth that his day is comming.
            
            
               
                  Psal. 37.33.
               
               The wicked haue drawne their sworde, and haue bent their bowes to cast downe the poore and needie, and to slay such as be of vpright conuersation.
            
            
               
                  Psal. 37.
               
               But their sworde shall enter into their owne hartes, and their bowes shalbe broken.

            To the right worshypfull Sir Francis Drake Knight: Roger Cotton, wisheth continuance of health, with prosperous estate and felicitie.
            
               THe happie estate of the present, with the constant hope of further prosperitie (Right worshipfull) by the glorious conquest of the heauenly armie of holy ones, and the vertuous zeale that you haue, alwayes had to defende Gods trueth, her Maiesties right, and Countries tranquilitie, hath imboldened mee (being a poore brother of the Worshypfull societie of Drapers, whereinto you were lately incorporated) to present vnto you an Historicall discourse and short thankes giuing, which I haue rudely, but truly, and according to the storie, collected out of the holy Scriptures, declaring therein the extreame rankour of the wicked agaynst the godly, throughout all ages, with the iust iudgementes of God, duely rewarding their impieties; and also a description of the marks of that Tirannicall Sea of Antichrist, the sworne enemie to the gracious Gospell of eternall saluation, heereby hoping to encourage all such as would auoyde the heauie burthē of that Egyptiecal yoke, the captiuitie of

that misticall Babell, and the persecution of Gog and Magog, to study the holy worde of God, which is the sworde of the spirite; and to take vnto them the whole armor thereof, whereby they may be able to resist all the assaultes of the euyll one, with all his souldiers, and may also haue a full hope in the Lord, that in the ende they shall haue a victorious conquest, as now we haue, and so learne with Martyrs, Apostles, and holy Prophets, to reioyce and sing Hosanna and Haleluiah for the wound of that seauen headed Oragon, and dyly to pray for the ouerthrow of his whole rage: so shall their naked sores be couered & healed with the leaues of that florishyng Tree of euerlasting lyfe, which groweth by the Christall streames of that pure Riuer, running through the Citie of God, the celestial Ierusalem. This if your Worshyp shal accept, being the first frutes of my small paynes, not regarding the barbarousnes of my phrase & verse, being no Scholler, but the zealous affection of my hart, to the loue of your godly care, for the vpholding of Gods Religion. I shall (hauing so skilfull a Pilote to stirre my sterne, and so worthy a Captaine to encounter the enimie) be imbouldned hereafter to wade into deeper discourses (as God shall blesse, and time permit) to gratifie your worthinesse withall: Vntill which time, I humbly commende your selfe, and your most vertuous proceedinges, to the gracious gouernment of the puissant Iehouah, the victorious King of eternall glorie.
            
               Your worships to command, R. C.
               
            
         
         
            
            To the Reader.
            
               
                  IT hath been an vsuall thing, gentle Reader, throughout the whole Scriptures, for later ages, to make recitall of former stories, both concerning the cruell rage of the wicked against the Church of God, and also the tender care the Lord hath had for the defence and deliuery of his: and vpon present experience of the same, haue assembled themselues togeather, not onely to shew foorth Gods glorie by songes of prayse and thanksgiuing, but also to confesse that as they haue heard, so haue they seene: and therefore in the pallaces of Syon was God wel knowen for a refuge, yea for a God most great, & therefore by them most highly to be praysed. Euen so likewyse (since all thinges that are written in the holy Scriptures, are written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures, might haue hope:) I haue brought to your remembraunce (as breefely as I can) the cheefest stories therein conteined for this purpose, that when you haue heard, you may also say, that you haue seene, his great seueritie in the late miraculous destruction of his and our Romish enimies, and his accustomed mercie in the deliuerance and preseruation of his children, and so by that meanes be stirred vp to giue all thankes and prayse vnto God, and to haue your hartes firmly stayed vpon him, who is a wall and strong defence to Syon his Beloued, and who continually sits vpon a throne, hauing a Rainebow round about, to assure vs of his fauour to be continued,

agaynst the waters which the olde Dragon powreth out by the Italian Synagoue of Rome, wherefore seeing he is our defence against the troublesome waues of this lyfe, let vs neuer cease to be talking of the noble actes which hee hath doone, and the great deliuerance which he hath shewed from tyme to tyme: and so take occasion to haue our mouthes filled with his prayses continually: so shall God haue his glorie, and I my whole desire: and thus I rest, praying for thy peace, and wishing (for my brethrens sake) thy prosperitie, O Ierusalem.
            
               Yours in the Lord, R. C.
               
            
         
         
            
            P. K. In commendation of this worke.
            
               
                  IF Poets pens deserued prayse,
               Whose paynes deserued well:
               Much more the mindes, the pens, the men,
               Indued with heauenly skill.
            
            
               Of loue, of warre, of Plants, of Birds,
               Of Sheepe and Shepheards toyes:
               Haue Poets writ who lie in dust,
               Bereft of heauenly ioyes.
            
            
               Yet these we see through worlde their prayse,
               With eccho doth resound:
               Much more is prayse to Cotton due,
               Who makes Gods worde his ground.
            
         
         
            G. W. in prayse of this Booke.
            WIll men be taught, in whom to put their trust,
            In time of troubles stird by tyrants pride:
            Or will they learne to whom the godly must
            Sing thankfull Himnes, when happie dayes betide?
            Lo heere a Lantarne, that may giue them light,
            Both to relie, and to reioyce a right.
         
         
            A. W. in commendations of this discourse.
            LEt worldly wisedome stande a part, let policie giue place:
            To simple ones, to little babes, whose hartes are filde with grace.
            
               Whose tongues declare his prayse, to whom all prayse belonges.
            With ioyfulnes, with singing cheere, in Psalmes and spirituall Songs.
            And you that hitherto haue hid, your Talents in the ground:
            Come learne of him that hath but one,
Gods mercies to resound.
         
         
            R. I. in commendation of this worke.
            YOu idle Drones, that fleece and cannot feede,
            You speechles ones, that can not barke nor bay:
            You Slowwoormes mates, that make so euill speede,
            To spie the Foxe, and driue the Wolfe away,
            This Booke shall be your iudge an other day.
            Which sweetely doth recorde:
            The mercies of our Lord.
            And liuely paints the whoredome of that Beast,
            Whose marke Gods Saints do faythfully detest.
            FINIS.
         
         
            
            Let them which hauē beene redeemed of the Lord, shew how he hath deliuered them from the hande of the oppressor. Psal. 107.2.
            
            
               
                  NOw may we all of England say of truth:
                     Psal. 124.
               
               As we haue heard,
                     Psal. 48.8
                   so haue we seene performd
               In these our dayes most worthy to be learnd:
                     Psa. 121. to the end & 125.2.
                  
               
               How that the Lord doth stil his Church defend
               From cruell foes,
                     Psa. 37.33
                   whom his to hurt pretend.
            
            
               Let vs therefore vnto our mindes now call,
                     Psal. 37.1 14.32.
                  
               
               The cruell rage that wicked men haue had,
               Agaynst the Lordes, as though they had been mad:
               Them to deuoure as Lions spoyle their pray,
               Inuenting their oppression day by day.
            
            
               As bloodie Caine,
                  
                     Gen. 4.1.1 18. & 1.
                   the first of Serpentes race,
               That onset gaue against the womans seede,
               For whose good workes he wrought that wicked deed.
                     Iohn. 3.12 & Iude. 1
                  
               
               And as began, the combate still doth hold,
               That sonnes of lyfe, euen swallow quicke they would.
            
            
               As Lamech next,
                     Gene. 4.23 24.
                   a bud of that vile roote,
               Who in his rage, all men would wound and kill,
               As though he did the law of God fulfill:
               Whose deedes to grace he coulde a Scripture cite,
               Although true sence and meanyng wrested quite.
            
            
               
               
                  
                     Gen. 9.22.25.26.27.
                  Next him that Cham the sonne of Noe the iust,
               who soone reuiues the wounded seede of Cain,
               
               and doth as ill vncoueryng Fathers shame:
               and so procures a curse most vehemently,
               Vpon himselfe and his posteritie.
            
            
               
                  
                     Gen. 10.8.9.10. & 11.3. to the ende.
                  As he for one, that Nimrod hunter great,
               who sayd, Come buyld a Tower fayre and hie,
               a stately one, whose top may reach the skie:
               that we may get vnto our selues a name,
               and all may see we well deserue the same.
            
            
               
                  
                     Gen. 11.
                  But this their rage the Lord did soone espie,
               and downe he came their language to confound,
               that one knew not what others did propound:
               and Citie theirs he called Babylon,
               
               which name doth shew, They found Confusion.

                  And Ismael next, Aegiptian Hagars sonne,
               who Isaac skoft, of Abram blessed seede,
               so as it shewes how Cham doth still proceede,

                  to hate, as Cain, the brother working good,
               foure hundred yeeres afflicting Isaacs blood.

               good Iaacobs blood vnkindly seeke to spill,
               like rauenyng Wolfe, which seely Lambe doth kill:

                  and birthright solde for messe of pottage red,
               despising Christ, the Lambe, the Rocke, the Bread.

                   as Pharaoh hard of hart,
               good Abrams seede most hardly to intreat,
               with slauish toyle, and burthens ouer great:
               in bricke and clay, and bondage very ill,
               vntil at length their children he did kill.

                  And thus they were foure hundred yeeres too long,
               afflicted sore by Chams Aegyptian dogs:
               but they were plagu'd with lice, with flies, with frogs,
               with blood for blood, with blaines, with scabs with haile,
               to shew how smal man can gainst God preuaile.
            
            
               Himselfe,

                   his host, his chariots and his horse,
               inclosd with waues, were tombd in heapes of sand,
               where Israel past from yoke of Egypt land:
               their ryder fell,
                     Exod. 15.20.21.
                   and Israel skapt away,
               and Miriam sung such prayse, as now we may.
            
            
               The seconde part.

                  that warre did make, Gods people to withstand,
                  whereby they might them keepe from holy land:
                  But Moses prayd whyle Sunne abode in skye,
                        Exod. 17.8 to the ende.

                  And God a curse vpon that nation gaue,

                  and vow did make their name for to roote out,
                  because gainst his they shewd themselues so stout:

                  that he would warre with them continually.

                     And when this Stone a Mountaine great was growne,
                  and all the earth with glorie it had filde,
