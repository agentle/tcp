            Contayning THIRTEENE FORCIBLE MOTIVES, diſſwading from communion with the CHVRCH of ROME:
            Wherein is demonſtratiuely proued, that the now Romiſh Religion (ſo farre forth as it is Romiſh) is not the true CATHOLIKE Religion of CHRIST, but the ſeduction of ANTICHRIST:

            TO THE TRVELY VERTVOVS, AND WORTHY KNIGHT, SIR OLIVER CROMWEL, T. B. wiſheth encreaſe of grace and all happineſſe.
            
            
               SIR,
            
            
               THERE bee many particular reſpects that mooue me to be bold, to ſet your name in the frontiſpice of this work: As firſt, your ſincere loue to true Religion, and the Profeſſors thereof: Secondly, your true deteſtation of the Romiſh Synagogue, and

the malignant influences of thoſe wandring Planets, that infect the aire of our Church, and ſeeke by mining, poyſoning, and other deuilliſh practices, to turne our Jeruſalem into Babel. Thirdly, for that your ſelfe, with your religious Lady, worthy children, and brethren, and great family, haue beene a long time the principall auditors of my vnworthy miniſtery, wherein many of theſe points haue been deliuered vpon occaſion, that you may ſee them here more fully diſcourſed, and ſo be the better confirmed in the truth. And laſtly, the particular obligations of loue and duty, wherwith I am bound vnto you for many extraordinary fauours and kindneſſes receiued. Theſe be the motiues, that haue moued mee to ſelect your ſelfe principally aboue all others to dedicate theſe motiues vnto. For the which I deſire no more patronage and protection, then the truth of the ſeuerall points contayned therein doe deſerue. Let them ſtand vpon their owne legs, or fall and periſh. I know, they ſhall encounter with many bitter oppoſitions, and ſharpe aduerſaries, who will be ready

to ſift euery ſentence, and to find a knot in a bull-ruſh: but my ſhelter is the buckler of truth, and the brazen wal of a good conſcience; with which being armed, I hope, through Gods aide, that I ſhall be as willing and able to entertayne the re-encounter, if any aſſault be made, as I was willing to giue this on-ſet: I confeſſe that theſe are not the tithe of the arguments, that might be produced againſt the Romiſh religion, yet I doubt not, but that euen theſe few may ſerue, both to diſcouer the falſhood thereof, and to confirme and ſtrengthen thoſe that ſtagger, and are weake in the truth: the Lord accompanying theſe endeuours of his ſeruant with his bleſſing, as I hope, and pray that he would be pleaſed to do. Theſe motiues, ſuch as they are, I willingly deſire may be graced by your name, hoping that your name ſhal no way be diſgraced by them: accept them therefore, as tokens of my ſincere loue to your ſelfe, and zeale to the truth, for which I deſire no other requitall, but an augmentation of your zeale to the ſame truth, and a greater deteſtation of that Religion, which

already you abhor. The Lord of his mercy encreaſe in you more and more all ſpirituall graces for your ſoules health, and multiply his bleſſings temporall vpon your head, and crowne you with glory, and immortality eternall in the life to come.
            
               Your worſhips moſt affectionate and deuoted,
THO. BEARD.

                  Whereby is demonſtratiuely prooued, that the now Romiſh Religion (ſo farre forth as it is Romiſh) is not the true Catholique Religion of CHRIST, but the ſeduction of Antichriſt.
            
            
               THE PREAMBLE.
               
                  THat which Ireneus (an ancientI. Iraeneus lib. 
                        •
                      cap. 54. and godly Father of the Church) ſpeaketh of all Heretickes, that all the Helleborus in the world is not ſufficient to purge them, that they may vomit out their follie, may truely be ſpoken of the Church of Rome, and her adherents, that it is a difficult matter, if not almoſt impoſſible, to reclaime her from her errors, and to heale her wounds. All the balme of Gilead will not do it, nor all the ſpirituall phiſicke that can be miniſtred; for there

are two ſinnes which of all other are moſt hard to bee relinquiſhed, Whoredome, and Drunkenneſſe: the one, becauſe it is ſo familiar and naturall to the fleſh: the other, becauſe it breedeth by cuſtome ſuch an vnquenchable thirſt in the ſtomacke, as muſt euer anon be watered: with both which ſpirituall diſeaſes, the Church of ROME is infected. She is the Whore of Babylon, with whome the Kings of the Earth haue committed fornication, and who hath made drunke with the Wine of her fornicationsReuel. 17. 12. all the Inhabitants of the Earth. In regard of the firſt, Ieremie prophecied of her, that though paines be taken
                  Ierem. 51. 9. 
                  to heale her, yet ſhee could not be healed. And in regard of the ſecond, Saint Paul prophecied, that GOD would ſend2. Theſ. 2. 10. 11 them ſtrong deluſion, that they ſhould beleeue lies, that all they might bee damned that receiued not the loue of the truth. Notwithſtanding, though the hope bee as little of the reclaiming of moſt of them, as of turning an Eunuch into a man, or making a blacke Moore white; yet I haue propounded in this diſcourſe a ſtrong potion compounded of ingredients; which if they bee not paſt cure, may purge and cleanſe them of their diſeaſe, and reduce them to the ſanity of Chriſtian Religion. Which if their queaſie ſtomackes ſhall eyther refuſe to take, or hauing taken, ſhall vomit vp againe, and not ſuffer them to worke vpon their conſciences: yet this benefit will ariſe, that God ſhall be glorified, the truth manifeſted, and all that loue the truth confirmed: and they alſo themſelues, that are ſo drowned in error, that they will rather pull in others ouer head and eares vnto them, and ſo drowne together, then be drawne out of the myre by any helpe, ſhall be conuinced in their conſciences of their moſt groſſe apoſtacie. With this confidence towards Gods glorie, and the good of his Church, though with little hope of recouering them from their obdurate blindneſſe; I enter into my intended taske, deſiring the Lord to giue a bleſſing to theſe poore labours, which I conſecrate to my Lord and Maſter Ieſus Chriſt, whom I ſerue, and the Church his Spouſe, of which I profeſſe my ſelfe to bee one of the meaneſt members.
            
            
               
               
                  MOTIVE. I. That Religion which in many points giueth libertie to ſinne, is not the truth: but ſuch is the Religion of the Church of ROME: ergo, &c.
               
                  THe firſt propoſition is an vndoubted truth, and2. MAIOR▪ Iames 1. 27. needs no confirmation, eſpecially, ſeeing S. Iames deſcribeth true Religion by theſe attributes, pure and vndefiled: And S. Paul
                  2. Tim. 3. 1. Tit. 1. 1. calleth it the myſterie of godlineſſe, and the doctrine according to godlineſſe. And herein conſiſteth an eſſentiall difference betwixt the true Religion and all falſe ones; ſo that it muſt needs follow, that, that Religion which is eſſentially the cauſe and occaſion of ſinne, and openeth a wide window to vngodlineſſe, cannot be the truth of God, but muſt needs fetch it beginning from the deuill, who is the author of all euill. The Goſpell indeede may by accidentRom. 7. 11. Matt. 10. 34. be the occaſion of euill, as S. Paul ſaith, The law is the occaſion of ſinne, for it ſtirs vp contention and ſtrife, and diſcouers the corruptions of Mans heart, and by oppoſing againſt them (as a damme againſt a ſtreame) makes them to ſwell and boyle, and burſt forth beyond the bounds: howbeit, here the cauſe is not in the Goſpell, or Lawe; but in the corruption of mans heart, which, the more it is ſtirred, the more it rageth and ſtriueth to ſhew it ſelfe. But neuer yet was the doctrine of godlineſſe the cauſe of wickedneſſe, nor the pure and vndefiled Religion of Chriſt Ieſus, an eſſentiall procurer and prouoker vnto ſinne.
               3. This therefore being thus manifeſt, all the queſtion and difficultie remaineth in the ſecond propoſition; to wit, that the Religion of the Romiſh Church is ſuch as openeth a gappe vnto ſinne, and giueth notorious libertie and ſcope to vngodlineſſe; and that not by way of accident or occaſion, but neceſſarily as the cauſe to the effect, Qua data, neceſſariò ſoquitur effectus; as the Logicians ſpeake: and therefore being an 
                     •
                  npure and defiled Religion, and the myſterie of iniquitie,

not the myſterie of godlineſſe: it cannot be that true Religion which Chriſt our Sauiour brought with him from heauen, and left here vpon earth blameleſſe and vnſpotted like himſelfe, to be the way to lead vs vnto heauen, where hee is.

This is the firſt Romiſh doctrine directly tending to2. liberty: A ſecond, nothing inferiour to the former, is their doctrine of popiſh pardons and Indulgences: a doctrine indeed full of all licentiouſnes, ſtuft with impiety, and letting the reynes looſe to all manner of villany. For thus they teach, that the Pope being Chriſts Vicar heere on earth, hath the keyes of the kingdome of Heauen in cuſtody, to admit in by Indulgence, or to ſhut out by excommunication as hee ſhall ſee cauſe: and that the merits of Martyrs (to wit) their workesBel. de Indulgen. lib. 1. ca. 2. of ſupererogation, which they haue more then they need for their owne ſaluation, which (mixt with the merites of Chriſt) they call the treaſure of the Church, are to bee diſpenſed and diſpoſed at his pleaſure.

from the temporall puniſhment: but theſe popiſh pardons acquit and diſcharge both from the guilt, and from the puniſhment temporall and eternall, as ſome of them affirme, and they that mince it fineſt, from the guilt and temporall puniſhment: ſo that Chriſts paſſion commeth ſhort of his Vicars

And for aſmuch as Chriſt may take away all paine, therefore the Pope alſo (who is his Ʋicar) may. Theſe be the Archbiſhops goodly reaſons, the one whereof is meere fooliſh and friuolous, the other blaſphemous: but howſoeuer it be, yet thouſands of ignorant perſons haue receiued theſe as their Creed, and by them beene ſeduced to the vtter ruine and deſtruction of their ſoules.

Yea, Boniface the eight granted, of his bountifull liberality, 82000. yeares pardon, for euery time ſaying a prayer of S. Auguſtine, printed in a Table at Venice, and that toties quoties. Iohn the 22. granted twentie yeres pardon to euery one that doth but bow his head at the naming of Ieſus. Here is a notable pardon indeed: a man may in one day prouide for millions of ages, and not onely for himſelfe, but to helpe his friends out of Purgatory. Beſides all this, their holy Father the Pope vſeth to conſecrate and hallow an infinite number of Crucifixes, and Medailes, and Agnus Dei's, Holy graines or Beads, and ſuch like traſh, and ſend them abroad into the world, that whoſoeuer weareth one of them about him, if he bee at the poynt of death, and ſay but in his heart the name Ieſus, ſhall haue a plenary and full forgiueneſſe of all his ſins.

I referre the Reader to others that haue amply diſcouered theſe ſecrets of the whore of Babylon. But to returne to the poynt, Is not this a doctrine (I pray you) of licentiouſneſſe? who would feare to ſinne, when pardon may be obtayned at ſo low a rate? for bowing the head, ſaying ouer a ſhort prayer, viſiting a Church, creeping to a Croſſe, wearing a Crucifixe, pardon may be purchaſed for ſinnes, without number, and that for yeares without number. What is the height of liberty, if this be not? But yet they aſcend higher, for there is a great Mart of all theſe Indulgences at Rome, there you may haue them at a very lowe price, rather then goe without, yea, cheaper than any other ware: and leſt Rome ſhould ſeeme too farre to fetch them thence, there are petty markets and faires of them in euery Country, and the Pedlers that carry about this traſh, are the Prieſts and Ieſuites.

Is it any maruaile now, if whores and theeues and notorious offenders turne Papiſts, ſeeing they may haue ſo eaſily a full and plenary remiſſion of all their offences? And that which is yet a greater emboldening of men to ſinne then all the reſt; they oftentimes for money pardon a ſinne before it be committed, as it is conſtantly reported of Parry, that he brought with him his pardon in his pocket for murdering the late Queene, intended by him. But I haue heard of ſome that haue beene hanged with their pardons

about their necks, and ſo (it may be) was that bloudyminded Traytor. And this was it that emboldened the GermansChemnit. exam. de poeniteat. to robbe the Popes pardoner, becauſe they had purchaſed of him before, a pardon for the next ſinne they ſhould commit, though it were a great one: now this was the next, and therfore iuſtly he could not find fault with them.

Who ſo will plainly ſee in one view the monſtrous licentiouſneſſe of life that iſſueth from this puddle of Popiſh pardons, let him read the third grieuance of the German Nation, in the Booke of their Centum grauamina, exhibited to the Popes Legate at Noremberge, Anno 1522. in the latter end whereof are theſe wordes of iuſt complaint. By the ſale and marchandize of this ware, not onely Germany is ſpoyled of money, but Chriſtian godlineſſe is extinguiſhed, where, when euery one, according to the quantity of his payment, taketh vnto himſelfe liberty to ſinne: hence whoredome, inceſt adultery, periury, murther, theft, robbery, vſury, and a whole heape of miſchiefes haue proceeded; for, what miſchiefe will men be afraid to commit, when they be once perſwaded that they haue obtained licence and impunitie to ſinne, not onely in this life, but alſo after their death? Hitherto is the complaint of Germany, which alſo may bee the iuſt complaint of the whole world.
               17 A third doctrine of the Papiſts (opening the gap to licentiouſnes)3. is their auricular confeſſion, and popiſh penance: I ioyne them together, becauſe they goe together in their practice, and are both together members of one of their new deuiſed Sacraments. True it is, that in outward ſhowe theſe carry a ſemblance of ſeuere diſcipline: but if we ſearch into their bowels, we ſhall find them to be the greateſt baytes that

can be vnto diſſoluteneſſe: For when they teach that the enumeration and reckoning vp of all a mans finnes in the yeare, of a Prieſt, once a yeare, obtaineth preſent abſolution and pardon at the Prieſts hands, who is both Iudge in this cauſe, and Phiſicion; and hath power to loofe and binde, and to open and ſhut, to wound and heale, by the key of powerCoſter. enchir. committed to him: What is this, but to open a gappe to all wickednes? for when men are perſwaded that there is ſo ready and eaſie a meanes to be rid of their ſinne, what need they be ſo chary of committing it? Hence it is (as by lamentable experience it is found true) among thoſe that are deuoted to this Religion, they ſinne freely, that they may confeſſe and be abſolued; and when they haue confeſſed they ſinne againe, that they may confeſſe againe, making no conſcience how they liue all the yeare, and what horrible ſinnes they commit, being perſwaded that at Eaſter, by the ſhriuing of a Prieſt, they are cleane abſolued. Iuſt like a drunkard, that drinkes ſo long till hee vomite, and when his ſtomacke is diſgorged, drinkes afreſh, that he may vomite afreſh: or like a glutton, that ſurfets all the yere long in all maner of intemperancy, & then in the ſpring takes phiſick to purge out the naughty humors frō his ſtomake, & as ſoone as he is purged, fals again to his ſurfeting & ryot, in hope to be purged again in the ſpring.
               18. This is the fruite of Popiſh ſhrift, commended ſo highly by them to be ſo ſoueraigne a medicine againſt ſin; which, if it be ſo, why did not Chriſt and his Apoſtles vſe it? were they not as carefull to preſerue men from ſinne, as the Pope and his ſhauelings are? or is the Pope and his Apoſtles wiſer then Chriſt Ieſus and his Diſciples? why was it not vſed in the Primitiue and purer times of the Church?

                   two learned Papiſts, affirme plainely, that it was neither ordained by Chriſt, nor vſed by the ancient Church: and Chryſostome telleth vs, that God doth not enforce vs to come forth and diſcloſe our ſinnes to any man. He requireth no more (ſaith he) but that we ſpeake to him alone, and to him alone confeſſe our faults. I, but the Popes iudgement is more diuine, and the times of Popery are more free from corruption (beleeue

it who liſt) and therefore howſoeuer then, yet now it is found to be a ſoueraigne preſeruatiue againſt ſinne: as if they that feare not to offend in the preſence of God, will bluſh to confeſſe their offences in the eare of a ſinnefull Prieſt: or as if the law of God were of leſſe force to keep men in awe, which they cannot eſcape, than the feare of a mortall man, whome they may deceiue.
               19. But let them ſay what they will, and cloake their licentiouſneſſe with neuer ſo holie pretences, all that haue any iudgement to diſcerne colours, which the blinde Romaniſts cannot do, or any wiſedome to trye the ſpirits and doctrines whether they be of God or no; know, that Romiſh ſhrift is nothing but a ſhift to diue into mens purſes, and a tricke of policie to ſearch into their purpoſes, that by that meanes they may enrich their owne coffers, and vphold their Antichriſtian Hierarchie: for by this deuice they vnderſtand the ſecrets of ſtate, and ciſcouer mens affections in Religion, and ſo cunningly inſinuate themſelues into the managing of all affaires, both for preuention of preiudice to themſelues, and vndermining their oppoſites: this is the policie of Romiſh ſhrift; and were this all, it were to be borne withall, if withall it did not open a wide doore of liberty to others, as I haue in part ſhewed; and were not a bawd of vncleaneſſe to the ſhriuers themſelues. Heare what one of their own writers reuealeth concerning this laſt poynt. It is an ordinary practice (ſaith he)Aluar. pelag. & Planet. eccl. lia. art. 27. 
                  for Prieſts to commit execrable villany with women at ſhrift, rauiſhing wiues, and deflowring maids in the Church, and committing Sodomie with young men, &c. Cornelius Agrippa, another of their owne, hath left in writing for all poſterity to remember, that Auricular confeſſion is genus quoddam lenocinij, and heDe vanit. c. 64. referreth vs for proofe thereof vnto the Tripartite Hiſtory: Nec deſunt mihi (ſaith hee) ſi referre velim cognita recentia exempla. I need not to ſeeke for farre examples: for I could relate many freſh and well knowen, if I would. And then he concludes, that Prieſts and Friers, and Monkes, hauing, vnder pretence of Religion, free acceſſe vnto any woman many times, whoſe ſoules they ſhould gaine to God, their bodies they ſacrifice to the deuill.
                  
Thus is their owne filth caſt in their faces by their owne fauorites, who by all likelihood would ſpeake the beſt of their mother, and in no reſpect durſt ſlander her, for feare of ſhame and puniſhment. Wee finde in the Tripartite Hiſtory (to the which it may be Agrippa had relation) of the rape of a noble woman by a Deacon in the time of ſhrift; for the which cauſe Nectarius the Biſhop of Conſtantinople, baniſhed this ſecret confeſſion out of his Church; as alſo, all the Biſhops of the Eaſt did the like in theirs.

And others ſeeke to elude ti, by ſaying the ſtory is miſtaken, and that Nectarius baniſhed not confeſſion it ſelfe, but the neceſſitie of confeſſing to one certaine Prieſt, which though it bee a vaine gloſſe which corrupts the text, as Chemnitius fully proueth: yet, notChem. exam. Tri. de confeſs. to ſtand vpon it, this is euident, that ſuch a foule fact was committed in the time of ſhrift, and that thereupon this ſecret confeſſion was either vtterly abrogated, or at leaſt ſo reſtrained, that it was no more ſecret, for feare of ſuch like enormities: and indeed graunt that Nectarius did euill in aboliſhing all kind of confeſſion, as Socrates, and Sozomene charge him: and as wee alſo will not excuſe him, for wee hold that there may be an holy & profitable vſe of confeſſion in the Church, for the ſearching of the wounds of ſinnefull ſoules, and applying of fit counſell & comfort to diſtreſſed conſciences; yet from thence we may deriue theſe three concluſions, firſt, that ſecret ſhrift was then thought not to bee ex iure diuino, but onely a tradition of the Church, for elſe it could not haue been aboliſhed; ſecondly, that it was not thought neceſſarie for the remiſſion of ſinnes, as the Romaniſts teach; and thirdly, that it is a moſt dangerous occaſion to vncleannes, which is the matter we haue in hand to proue.
               20. If any here except, that theſe enormities proceed from the abuſe, and not from the vſe of ſhrift, and that they bee

perſonall frailties, and not corruptions of doctrine. I anſwer; firſt, that the very vſe thereof is ſo daungerous, eſpecially to theſe ranke Votaries, that it is tenne to one but it euer degenerates into the abuſe: for, wanting the lawfull remedy ordained by God, no maruaile if their luſts breake forth into lawleſſe actions.

And laſtly, though there may bee a profitable vſe of confeſſion, as I haue ſaid; yet this Auricular enumeration and Romiſh ſhrift cannot be lawfully vſed, becauſe they make the very act thereof meritorious to ſaluation, and the abſolution of the Prieſt an actuall and reall remitting of ſinne; which opinion cannot but animate men to the committall of ſinne, ſeeing they haue their remedy ſo ready at hand, to wit, after the vttering a fewe wordes, the mouth of the Prieſt to abſolue them.
               21. As for Contrition, which by their doctrine muſt goe before Confeſſion, that makes the matter neuer a whit theRoffenſ. ep. art. 5. Maldon. in Sum. q. 16. art. 1.

Surely this kind of contrition is ſo farre from brideling our corrupt nature from ſinne, that it more incites and prickes it forward; for who would feare to ſinne, if this be true, that the leaſt griefe conceiued in heart, together with the diſcouering of it to the Prieſt, and the Prieſts formall abſolution, is ſufficient for the full pardon and remiſſion thereof?
               22. But peraduenture the laſt part of this Sacrament binds vp the two former in greater ſeuerity: let vs conſider a little therefore of their penance and ſatisfaction. They condemne vs lowdly, and raile with open throat againſt vs, calling vs Libertines, and Epicures, for reiecting their penance and ſatisfactory paines after ſinnes committed. But, who are the

Libertines, they or vs? let any indifferent reader (all preiudice ſet apart) iudge. Are we Libertines for renouncing their popiſh penance? why, there is no doctrine that more notoriouſly tends to liberty then this: For firſt, what are thoſe ſatisfactory workes which they enioyne poore penitents?

If Almes be enioyned by the Confeſſor to the poore penitent, then muſt an Abby be built, or ſome religious houſe to nouriſh a company of idle drones, good for nothing but fruges conſumere; or ſuppoſe an high-way bee repayred, or a Church reedified, or an Hoſpitall erected, what terrour can this be from ſinne, when the penalty may thus be diſcharged by the purſe? As for their Faſting, watching, whiping, going barefoote, though it carry a ſhew of zeale in reſpect of not ſparing the body, yet it is a plaine imitation of Baals Prieſts; and little profitable (as Saint Paul ſaith) to godlineſſe, but ratherCol. 2. 23. 1.

Indulgentia eſt remiſſio harum actionū quae ſunt a Confeſſario iniunctae peccatori. It is the remitting of that penance which is enioyned a ſinner by his Confeſſor.

For what a ridiculous jeſt is this? he that hath offended, muſt do penāce after his confeſſion, or elſe hee cannot be ſaued, and after his penance is aſſigned, get but a pardon, and then there needes no further ſatisfaction.

But I paſſe them ouer, being ſufficiently diſcouered by others, to the ſhame of the Romiſh Religion. It ſufficeth, that by this little it is euident, that ſatisfactions are ſo farre from reſtraining, that they rather remit the reines to all liberty and licentiouſneſſe.
               24. Laſtly, to conclude, if ſo be their impoſed penance be at any time ſtrict & ſeuere, it is when the Pope i

                   offended, not when God. Men may franckly ſin againſt God, & no man will

ſay vnto him, blacke is thine eye: or if vpon his ſhriuing they enioyne him penance, either it ſhall be ſo eaſie that it will not much trouble him to endure it, or if it be too hard, he may either redeeme it with his purſe, or at leaſt commute it into another kind. But if their Lord god the Pope be offended, (ſo the Canoniſts ſtile him) then not onely ſeuerity, but cruelty muſt be exerciſed, then the whip and the ſcourge, then the fire and the fagot: Et ſcutica dignum horribili ſectere flagello: ThatHorace. which deſerued but a flap with a ferula, muſt be chaſtiſed with a ſcourge. As on the contrary, if the offence was only againſt God, and not the Pope, then that which deſerued to be ſeuerely corrected, muſt haue nothing but three flaps with a Fox-tayle; which is credibly reported by ſome Writers, to haue beene the penance of a Nunne, which was gotten withEthelr. Abbas de quod. mira. childe in her Cloyſter. Albeit another Nunne at Watton in Yorkeſhire, fared farre worſe for her wantonneſſe with a yong Monke of the ſame houſe: for being gotten with childe by him, ſhe was firſt impriſoned, (ſaith the Story) and then beaten vnreaſonably, and vnſeaſonably too, being great with childe: then the Monke that committed this treſpaſſe being taken and ſtript, and bound faſt to a ſtoole, a ſharpe knife was put into the Nunnes hand, and ſhee was compelled by moſt cruell enforcement to take vengeance on thoſe parts which had done her the miſchiefe, and to eate them alſo, with many other filthy circumſtances, which I ſhame to ſpeake of; but in concluſion, to make vp the matter with a miracle, two midwiues were brought from heauen to Miſtreſſe Nunne, by the ghoſt of Henry Murdach the Archbiſhop of Yorke, which diſcharged her of her childe without paine, and carryed it forth with them to heauen (with lie and all) ſo that it was neuer after ſeene. Is not this penance (thinke you) able to terrifie any one from committing the like ſinne? or rather, might not this Nunne ſay as another of her ſexe and profeſſion ſaid,Lumbard. Gratian. Comeſtor. after ſhe had had three Baſtards, which proued great Clarkes and learned men in the Church, that it was a happy ſcape which brought forth three ſuch worthy baſtards? ſo this might call her Sonne an happy Sonne, which was honoured

with ſo great a miracle. But let the Popes lawes bee broken, or his triple Crowne touched, and he ſhall ſmoake for it that dares do this.
               25. Their fourth doctrine tending (apparently, and by neceſſary conſequence) to looſneſſe, is their doctrine of vowed chaſtity, whereby they enioyne ſingle life, and prohibite matrimony to certaine kinds of men and women; to wit, ſuch as enter into holy orders, teaching and maintaining, that forPighius cont. 15. de caelibatu. Coſt. enchir. cap. de caelib. prop. 9. Bell. li. 2. demon. cap. 30. ſuch it is better to go to harlots then to marry: and that to go to a harlot now and then, is but a ſinne of infirmitie (as Pighius calleth it) but to marry, is no better then a reſolued, deliberate, or continuall incest, vtterly without all ſhame. What an occaſion, or rather a cauſe, this point of Romiſh doctrine hath beene of horrible ſilthineſſe and wickedneſſe of life, wofull experience, in all places where the Romiſh Religion beareth ſway, manifeſtly declareth. For to omit that this doctrine is but an vpſtart doctrine, in reſpect of true antiquity, brought in firſt by Pope Seritius three hundred and eighty yeares after Chriſt, who was the firſt that made any reſtraint of Prieſts marriages, as it is confeſſed by Polidore Virgill, thePolid. de Inuent. lib. 5. ca. 4.

Athanaſ. epiſt. ad Dracon. Prophets were married; and vnder the Goſpell, both Apoſtles and Diſciples had their wiues, and after them Biſhops and Preſtbyters: and the doctrine of the Scripture is, Marriage

                  is honourable among all men: and again, If they cannot abſtaine, let them marrie, for it is better to marrie then to burne: Yea, and Saint Paul giueth order concerning the wiues and children of Biſhops, which had beene needleſſe, if they might haue none. And laſtly, to omit that this prohibiting of marriage is called by Saint Paul one of the doctrines of deuils, euery1. Tim. 4. 13. one of which might be a ſufficiēt argument, not only to euince the vnſoundneſſe of this doctrine, but alſo to demonſtrate

how likely itmuſt needs be to occaſionate ſinne, comming not from God, and therfore not likely to haue his bleſſing to follow it; but from the deuill, and therfore moſt likely to ſerue for the aduancement of his kingdome. Notwithſtanding, to omit all theſe, and to refer them to a fitter place, let vs weigh this matter in the ballance of reaſon, and wee ſhall eaſily find that a great breach is hereby made for mens vnruely and vntoward affections, to burſt forth into horrible and damnable ſinnes.
               26. For firſt, the gift of Continency is no common, but a rare and ſingular gift, which God beſtoweth not vpon all, but vpon ſome few: this propoſition is prooued by that aphoriſme of our Sauiour; All men cannot receaue this thing, ſaue

It is proued alſo by Saint Paul in this concluſion, Euery man hath

                  his proper gift of God, one this way, another that way: for ſpeaking of the gift of continencie, he wiſheth that all men were as he himſelfe: but ſeeing they are not ſo, therefore he leaueth it free to marrie for ſuch as haue not that gift. But the Romiſh Clergy, together with the infinite orders of religious Votaries, are not few but many, and thoſe choſen promiſcuouſly without any reſpect had, whether they be endowed with that gift or no: therefore, being vnable to containe, and forbidden to vſe the lawfull remedy ordained by God, they muſt of neceſſity fall into lawleſſe and vnordinate luſts: beſides, ſeeing that euery man that will, be hee neuer ſo defamed for incontinency, and ſo by experience knowne to be voyde of that ſame excellent gift, may become a Votary, and on the contrary (our Sauiour ſaith) euery man cannot receaue this, what hope can there be of chaſtity among theſe men? Is the gift of chaſtitie indeed ſo common, that euery man may haue it that will? Is it ſo ordinary, that it is communicated to thouſands of Prieſts, Monkes, Friars, and Nunnes? yea, to innumerable of that order in all places?

why then, what meant Caſſander, a learned diuine of theirCaſſand. Art. cap. 1. owne, to ſay, that the world was come to that paſſe, that a man could ſcarce find one of an hundred, that kept himſelfe free from

                      1. Tim. 3. 
                  incontinency? And Eraſmus, that the number of Monkes, and Prieſts, that liued in whoredome and inceſt, was innumerable: weigh the reaſon now in his iuſt termes, they that cannot containe, muſt needs burſt forth, either into ſecret or open vncleanneſſe. But of infinite Romiſh votaries, few or none haue that gift to containe, therefore the reſt muſt neceſſarily fall into either ſecret or open vncleanneſſe, let any man iudge now, whether this doctrine doth not directly tend vnto looſeneſſe.
               27. If any alleadge that this gift of continency may bee obtained by faſting and prayer: I anſwere, two things. Firſt, If it may be thus obtained, it is a ſigne that they vſe but little the ſame holy exerciſes, ſeeing fewe among them doe attaine vnto it. Secondly, I anſwere, that continency is in the number of thoſe gifts, which may be denyed to a man ſalua ſalute, without danger of his ſaluation, becauſe it is not neceſſarie to ſaluation, nor common to all Gods children, but peculiar to ſome. Now the promiſe of our Sauiour, aske, and yee ſhall haue, is meant of things neceſſary to ſaluation, and not of particular and ſpeciall gifts. Thus Paul prayed thrice, that the pricke in the fleſh, the meſſenger of Sathan might be remoued
                  2. Cor. 12. 
                  from him: (and ſome ſay this was concupiſcence) yet he was not heard in that which he prayed for, becauſe hee might be ſaued without it, as it appeared in the anſwer giuen vnto him: my grace is ſufficient for thee. And beſides, what is it but a tēpting of God, to refuſe the ordinary remedy which God hath ordained, which is marriage, and to flye to extraordinary meanes? as if a man ſhould refuſe all bodily ſuſtenance on earth, in hope that God will feed him extraordinarily fromPſalm. 34. heauen at his deuout requeſt, becauſe he hath promiſed that thoſe which feare him, ſhall want nothing, and whatſoeuer we aske in the name of Chriſt, ſhall be graunted. Let Saint Auguſtine determine this doubt, whoſe reſolution is this concerning all things which men pray for, which are not neceſſary to
                  
                  ſaluation. Aliquando Deus iratus, dat quod petis, & Deus
                  Aug. Ser. 53. de verb. Dom. &c. 
                  propitius negat quod petis. Sometimes God granteth in anger, and ſometimes denyeth in mercie, that which thou deſireſt. And let Origens practice put it out of all doubt, who to auoid incontinencie, and to quench the fiery luſts of the fleſh, offered violence to his own fleſh, by cutting off thoſe parts wherin concupiſcence raigneth. If he had beene perſ
                     •
                  aded, that by faſting and prayer he could haue obtained that gift from heauen, ſurely he would haue macerated his body with the one, and brawned his knees with the other, rather then to haue fallen to that deſperate and vnnaturall remedy.
               28. But to leaue this their vaine obiection, and to come a little neerer to the poynt, how can that doctrine chooſe but lead to looſenes, which croſſeth not onely the ordinance of God, who was the firſt ordainer of Marriage, but alſo the inſtinctGeneſ. 3. of nature; for this was naturally inſtilled into all liuing Creatures, eſpecially Man, at the firſt creation, that he ſhould encreaſe and multiply: by vertue of which inſtitution of nature,Geneſ. 1. a deſire is engrafted in all the poſterity of Adam, of the propagation of their kind, that they may (as it were) liue in their ſucceſſion. And whereas Bellarmine obiecteth, that theſeBell. de Cler. lib. 1. cap. 21. words (Encreaſe and multiply) containe not a precept, but an inſtitution of nature, and a promiſe of fecundity, becauſe the ſame words are vttered to other Creatures, which are not capable of precepts, and alſo becauſe if it were a precept, it ſhould bind all to encreaſe and multiply, and ſo imurie ſhould be offered to Chriſt, to Marie, and other holie virgines. I anſwere, that a
                     •
                  beit one member of his reaſon is vnſound, to wit, that beaſts are vncapable of precepts; for God ſpake to the Fiſh, and it caſt vp Ionah on the dry land; which ſheweth, that beaſts in theirIonas 2. 10. kind vnderſtand Gods precepts, and obey; yet we do not ſay that this is an abſolute precept, binding all without exception to marriage, but onely a liberty granted to all that will, to marrie, that thereby mankind may be ſtill propagated: and therefore they which take away this liberty from all eccleſiaſticall perſons, and monaſticall Votaries, offer iniury to nature, and tyrannize ouer the bodies and ſoules of men. For,

whence ariſeth this neceſſary concluſion, that the vow of ſingle life is repugnant to nature, and therefore none may take it vpon them, but thoſe either in whome nature is defectiue, which our Sauiour ſaith were borne chaſte from their mothers
                  
                     Mat. 19 12. Baſil de vera virginitate. 
                  belly, or that are endowed with a ſupernaturall gift, as our bleſſed Sauiour, the bleſſed Virgin his mother, and other holy men and women: and ſo by conſequent it followeth, becauſe this gift is rare and extraordinary, that moſt of them (which by a raſh vowe binde themſelues from marriage) ſhould fall into fornication and promiſcuous luſt. The courſe of nature in man-kind is like the ſource of a running ſtreame, which by no dammes, nor artificiall barres can bee ſtopped, but it will runne either the naturall courſe in the channell, or ſome other by-paſſage, and that the more it is ſtopped, the more violently it rageth, except the fountaine and ſpring be dryed vp. So, except the fountaine of concupiſcence in incontinent perſons be dryed vp by a ſupernaturall and extraordinary worke, the more it is interrupted, the more outragiouſly it fometh. Therefore if the ordinary channell of marriage be dammed vp, it muſt needs burſt ouer the bankes of lawfulnes, and ſpread it ſelfe ouer the paſtures and medowes of adioyning neighbours. This is the very caſe of our Romiſh ſhauelings, being barred from marriage: they burſt ſorth like wilde Bulls into other mens grounds, and defile their beds by adultery, and fill their houſes with baſtardy.
               29. If they challenge to themſelues the ſupernaturall gift of continency, experience ſheweth, that their challenge is vaine, for not one of an hundred of them liueth chaſtly: and beſides, as God hath giuen that gift often to the heathen and reprobate, as Hiſtories report, ſo very often, yea, moſt ordinarily doth he deny it to his own children: for ordinary grace doth not aboliſh, but ſanctifie nature; ſo that this i
                     •
                   no gift of ordinary ſauing grace, but a ſuperordinary worke aboue grace, and that alſo many times without grace. If then it be not in the power of any to quench the inſtincts of nature, if 
                     •
                  t be not a worke of ordinary grace to aboliſh nature, but it requireth extraordinary grace for the effecting thereof; if the courſe of

nature be ſtopped one way, it will burſt forth another: then we may by ſound reaſon conclude, that the vowe of chaſtity and ſingle life, and the prohibition of marriage in the Church of Rome doth open a wide gappe to all looſe and licencious liuing.
               30. Laſtly, that all this is true, let the lamentable effects and fruits of this their doctrine ſtand vp for witneſſe and vmp
                     •
                  ers in this matter; for, how ſhall a man better iudge of the goodneſſe of the cauſe, then by the effects? a good

To beginne with Nicholas, one of the ſeuen Deacons, the prime Authour of the ſect of the Nicholaitans condemned by Saint Iohn, Apoc. 2. Let Epiphanius tell vs what
                     Epiph. tom. 2. lib. 1. haereſ. 2
                        •
                     . his opinion was, and what fruites iſſued there-from. This Nicholas hauing a beautifull wife, when hee ſawe others in admiration for their ſingle life, that he might not ſeeme inferiour to them, vtterly renounced the company of his wife, and determined neuer to haue fellowſhip with her againe. But when hee was not able to repreſſe any longer the flame of concupiſcence, and being aſhamed to returne to his wife, leſt he ſhould be condemned of inconſtancy, he choſe rather to giue ouer himſelfe to all manner of vnlawfull luſt, yea, to that which is againſt nature. And from hence ſprang the ſect of the Nicholaitans, whoſe chiefe opinion was this, that if ſo be they could abſtaine from lawfull marriage, it was no ſinne to defile themſelues with any other filthy or vnlawfull copulation. Here wee may behold a perfect mappe of the Romiſh ſingle life, with the fruits thereof. This happened in the firſt period of the primitiue Church.
               
                  31. Afterward in the Nicene Synode, when ſome went aboutSocr. li. 1. ca. 11▪ Soz. li. 1. ca 23. to prohibite marriage to the Clergy: Paphnutius a great learned Father of that aſſembly, gaine-ſaid with great vehemency the proceeding of that decree; giuing this for one principall reaſon, that it would bee the cauſe of horrible impurity and obſcaenity in the Eccleſiaſticall order; which, to bee a true prophecie, the euent afterward hath manifeſtly declared. After this, about the ſixe hundreth yeare of ourHuldericus Au▪ epiſtol. Lord, it is reported of Gregory the great, that when hee ſawe the heads of more than ſixe thouſand infants taken out of a Fiſh-pond, he ſighed, and confeſſed that the decree of ſingle life in the Clergie, was the cauſe thereof; and therefore condemning that decree, he commended the Apoſtles counſell, that it was better to marrie, then to burne, and added this moreouer, that it was better to marrie, then to giue occaſion to murder.
               
               32. After this, in the yeare eight hundred and ſixtie, Huldericus
                  Hulder. Auguſt. epiſt. ad Nich. 1. Biſhop of Auguſta in Germany, in his Epiſtle to Pope Nicholas the firſt, moſt liuely deſcribeth the filthy fruites of Popiſh ſingle life, his words be theſe, Nullum tam graue facinus, &c. There is no ſo great offence, which is not to be admitted, to the end that a greater then that may bee auoyded. Notwithſtanding, many flatterers deſirous to pleaſe men, not God, vnder a falſe ſhow of continency commit greater ſinnes, to wit, they defile their Fathers wiues, they abhorre not the embracings of men and bruite beaſts, though they be of the moſt holy order, they make no ſcruple to abuſe other mens wiues: And when as certaine Biſhops, and Archdeacons, are ſo giuen ouer to luſt, that they cannot abſtaine, neither from adulteries, nor inceſts, nor other filthy and vnnameable ſinnes; yet they affirme, that the chaſte marriages of Prieſts doe ſtincke in their noſthrils, and forbid, yea, conſtraine Clergie men to abſtaine from them: ſaying, that it is more honeſt to be entangled with many whores in ſecret, then to be tyed to one wife in publique. But, woe be to you Phariſecs, which doe all to be ſeene of men. Theſe be the expreſſe words of that reuerend Biſhop: after he thus concludeth, Whileſt the Clergie are conſtrained by Phariſaicall fury to giue ouer the lawfull fellowſhip
                  
                  of one wife, they are made fornicators, adulterers, and workers of other moſt filthy abominations, and that which with teares we behold, all of them rage in ſuch wickedneſſe. Hence it is that the Church of God is ſo ſcandalized, and the Clergy ſo deſpiſed. Who ſeeth not by this teſtimony of this great learned man in the very heate and middeſt of Popery, what fruites this doctrine then brought forth?
               33. After, in the yeare one thouſand and eightie, when that brand of hell Hidlebrand, otherwiſe called Gregory the ſeuenth, ſate in the Romane ſeate, who laboured earneſtly to bring in that tyrannicall decree vpon the Clergie in Germanie: Auentinus thus writeth, Gratum hoc fuit ſcortatoribus,
                  Auentinus. 
                  quibus, &c. This was acceptable to whoremongers, to whom now it was lawfull, in ſtead of one wife, to haue the fellowſhip of ſixe hundred harlots. Hence many falſe Prophets tooke occaſion by fables and miracles to caſt miſts ouer the truth, and by drawing places of Scripture to their purpoſe, to deceyue the people. In a word, when as very few did truely make warre with luſt, and ſome did faine continency for gaine ſake, the greateſt part, vnder the honest name of chaſtitie, did commit whoredomes, inceſts, adulteries euery where without puniſhment: thus writeth Auentine touching thoſe times.
               34. After this, in the yeare 1102. in a Synode at London, where Anſelme the Archbiſhop of Canterbury laboured with tooth and naile to interdict Prieſts of the vſe of lawfull marriage, allowed before vnto them by King William; many oppoſed themſelues againſt him, ſaying, it would be very dangerous, Ne dum mundicias viribus maiores appeterent, &c. L

                     ſt, while they deſired greater purity then their ſtrength was able to beare, they ſhould fall into horrible vncleannes, to the great ignominy of Chriſtian Religion. And when as notwithſtanding Anſelme had effected this prohibition, the next yeare after complaint was made vnto him, that in ſtead of marriage forbiddē, the horrible ſin of Sodomie raigned ouer all England, and from the Clergie crept alſo into the Laity; which he endeuoured to reſtraine alſo, but all in vaine: for the ordinance of God being neglected, what can the wiſdome and lawes of man doe good?

De conuerſ. ad Clericos cap. 29. peraduenture, in theſe ſixe hundred yeares laſt paſt, the Popiſh Cleargie, were more holy and leſſe licencious. Let Saint Bernard be iudge of his times; If (ſaith he) according to the Prophecie of Ezekiel, we ſhould digge through the wall, that we might looke into Gods houſe, there will peraduenture appeare within the wall a filthy abomination; for after fornications ſucceede adulteries, after inceſts, the paſſions of ignominie and works of filthineſſe are not wanting. I would to God that it neither behooued the Apoſtle to write theſe things, nor vs to relate them, that it might not be beleeued, that ſuch abominable luſt poſſeſſed the mind of man. Alas, the enemie of mankind hath beſprinckled the body of the Church with the execrable aſhes of Sodome, & that many of the very miniſters therof: And in the end he thus concludes; Many (I ſay, not all) yet many (they can neither be hidden for multitude, neither do they ſeeke to be hidden for impudency) I ſay, many ſeeme to haue giuen libertie to the occaſion of the fleſh, ābſtaining from the remedie of marriage, and burſting forth into all manner of wickedneſſe. Againe, the ſame Bernard in another place thus complaineth, Tolle de Eccleſia, &c. Take

But that I feare I haue too much offēded chaſte eares already, with raking into this dunghill, I conclude with the report of Martin Luther, he ſaith, that he ſaw Cardinals at Rome, which were accounted holy for no other cauſe, but that they were content onely to commit fornication and adultery with women, and did not giue themſelues to other vnnaturall luſts. Thus, as it were in a mappe, I haue deſcribed the filthy and abominable fruites that proceed from that Romiſh doctrine of vowed chaſtitie. Is it poſſible that the ſpring ſhould be good, when the ſtreams are thus corrupt?
               38. The fift doctrine of Poperie (giuing manifeſt occaſion5. of liberty to the profeſſours thereof) is their doctrine of veniall ſinnes. By which they teach, that many acts which are tranſgreſſions of the laws of God & men, yet are not properly

ſins, nor deſerue the wrath of God, but of their nature are pardonable; and therfore he which committeth any ſuch,Henr. Sum. mor. cap. 20. lib. 4. Tho. par. 3. q. 83. & 81. art. 3. Ouand. 4. d. 16.

Gregor. de Val. tom. 3. p. 1090. doth neither offer iniury to God, nor breake charity in reſpect of his neighbour, and ſo deſerues not hell, nor is bound to be ſorry for them, but that the knocking of the breſt, going to Church, being ſprinckled with holy water, or the Biſhops bleſſing, or croſſing ones ſelfe, or doing any worke of charity, though we neuer thinke actually of them, is a ſufficient ſatisfaction for them. This is the doctrine not onely of the Schoolemen, but alſo of the fineſt, and refyning Ieſuites, euen of Bellarmine himſelfe, who thus diſtinguiſheth veniallBellar. de omiſſ. grat. & ſtat. peccati lib. 1. ca. 3. ſinnes, that ſome are veniall of their own nature and kind, to wit, ſuch as haue for their obiect an euill and inordinate matter, but which is not repugnant to the law of God, and of our neighbour: others are veniall by the imperfection of the worke, which imperfection ariſeth partly, ex ſurreptione, that is, by vnaduiſed falling into them, without full conſent of will; and partly, ex paruitate materiae, by the ſmalneſſe of the matter which is committed, as if a man ſhould ſteale a halfe-peny, or ſome ſuch trifle.

Now, let the Readeriudge whether our doctrine, that all ſinnes of their owne nature are mortall, and deſerue condemnation, except they be repēted of, or heirs, that ſome are veniall, and binde not the offender to condemnation, doe more tend to liberty: whether we reſtraine more the people from ſinning, that thus ſay vnto them, All your ſinnes (though neuer ſo ſmall) are of their owne nature damnable, except by faith in the bloud of Chriſt they be purged away, and by repentance, which is a fruite of faith ſorrowed for, and laboured againſt: or they that ſay thus to them, A number of your

ordinarie ſinnes, are not damnable, you neede not faith in Chriſts bloud to purge them; nor repentance to bewaile them; nor care and endeuour to preuent them: who ſeeth not that our doctrine pulleth in, and theirs letteth out the reynes of libertie to our corrupt nature? for when a man beleeueth that he may do many things, which are in deed tranſgreſſions of Gods lawe, without offence to God, or hurt to his neighbour, or wounding of his owne conſcience; and, that after he hath committed them, he needeth not greatly to repent of them, or to be ſorry for them; but that they are done away by ſaying a Lords prayer, or hearing a Maſſe, or creeping to a Croſſe, or receiuing a little Holy water; what neede he make any conſcience of theſe ſo ſleight trifles; nay, how can hee chooſe but neglect and make light account of them? This is one of the deuils ſubtile deuices or iuggling trickes which Saint Paul ſpeaketh of, where with hee laboureth2. Cor. 2.11. to ſeduce ſimple ſoules, for either hee will aggrauate our ſinnes to driue vs to deſperation, or extenuate and excuſe them to draw to preſumption: the rocke and gulfe whereat many thouſand ſoules ſuffer ſhipwracke. And this laſt the moſt dangerous, wherein the Papiſts ſhew themſelues the deuils agents and factours, by this their doctrine of veniall ſinnes: for what is this but to excuſe ſinne, and to extenuate it, and ſo to make men preſume to commit thoſe things which they eſteeme of no greater moment?

writers, but theſe may ſuffice for our purpoſe, to demonſtrate what liberty this doctrine giues to looſneſſe. For hence men may be bold to ſweare, to curſe, to raile, to back-bite, to ſteale, to be drunke, to be idle, &c. & cloke all vnder this vaile, They are but veniall ſinnes. Yea, and becauſe the common people are not able to vnderſtand their nice diſtinctions of, againſt, and beſide charitie; ſurreption, and irruption; great and ſmall dammage, &c. therefore often groſſe and great ſinnes creepe in vnder the name of venials; if this be not a doctrine of liberty, what is?
               40. The ſixt and laſt doctrine tending to looſneſſe (the6. laſt, I meane, of thoſe which I intend to propound in this Diſcourſe, for there are many more that tend to the ſame end) is their doctrine of implicite and infolded faith; where by they teach, that if a man know ſome neceſſary poynts of Religion, as the doctrine of the God-head of the Trinitie, of Chriſts incarnation and Paſſion, &c. it is needleſſe to buſie himſelfe about the reſt by a particular or diſtinct knowledge: but it ſufficeth to giue aſſent to the Church, and to beleeue as the Paſtors beleeue. This implicite faith is the mother of ignorance, and this ignorance (ſay they is) the mother of deuotion: but what kind of deuotion I pray you? ſuch as the mother is, ſuch is the daughter, a blinde mother, andRom. 10. 2. Acts 3. 17. a blinde daughter: ſuch a deuotion and zeale which the Iewes had, when they crucified Chriſt; or as Saint Paul
                  Acts 22. 3. 4. had, when he perſecuted the Church of Chriſt; or which the Gentiles had, when they thought they did God good ſeruiceIoh. 16. 2. by putting to death the primitiue Chriſtians. Like Poliphemus, when his eye was bored out by

                  Mat. 22. 19. 
                  the Scripture, and the power of God, ſaith our Sauiour: and erring in manners, proceedeth from the ſame fountaine; for if the hyding of Gods word in the heart, is a preſeruatiue againſt
                  
                  ſinne, as the Prophet Dauid auoucheth: then the ignorancePſal. 119. 11. of Gods word muſt needs be the cauſe of many errours and enormities in life. To this agreeth the opinion of Chryſoſtome; Scripturarum ignoratio haereſes peperit: haec vitam corruptam
                  Chryſ. de Laz & Diuite, Hom. 3. 
                  inuexit, haec ſurſum ac deorſum omniamiſcuit. The ignorance of Scripture hath bred hereſies, brought in corruption of life, and turned all things vpſide downe. And alſo of Saint Hierome,
                  Hierom. who ſayth plainely, Ama ſcientiā Scripturarum, & carnis vitia non amabis. Loue the knowledge of the Scriptures, and thouſhalt not loue the vices of the fleſh. Whereby hee giueth vs to vnderſtand, that where there is no loue of knowledge,Ibid hom. 13. in 2. Cor. Greg. Niſſ. orat. de ijs qui adeunt Hieruſ. there muſt needs be the loue of vice: the reaſon is manifeſt, becauſe the Scripture is a moſt exquiſite rule and exact ſquire to try all our actions by, as Chryſoſtome calleth it, and a ſtraight and inflexible rule, as Gregory Niſſen termeth it. Now, if this rule, ſquire and ballance be hid from vs, how can we ſquare our actions aright? how can wee giue them their iuſt poyſe and weight? As the Carpenter that hath loſt his rule and line, cannot but erre groſly in his worke: So the Chriſtian that is depriued of this knowledge of Gods word, muſt needs runne into infinite foule and groſſe enormities.
               41. From this fountaine, conioyned with thoſe which went before, ſpringeth the monſtrous corruption of manners in all places, wh

                  Epiſ.

I could heape vp many like teſtimonies for the clearing of this poynt, but it is needleſſe, ſeeing that all that haue either gotten experimentall knowledge by their trauailes, or ſpeculatiue by their reading, can & will iuſtifie the truth of this poſition, that in no place of the world, more impiety, atheiſme, impurity, cruelty, poyſoning trechery, & all maner of villanie raigneth, then in Italy the Popes owne dominions, and in Rome vnder his Holineſſe noſe. So that for ſhame (but that the whore of Babylon, and her adherents haue brazen foreheads) they may ceaſe to lay that imputation of looſneſſe and wickedneſſe of life vpon vs and our Religion, and aſſume the aſperſion of it vnto themſelues, being farre more guilty, and their religion directly tending thervnto, by theſe ſix maine grounds which I haue in this firſt motiue propounded to the iudgement of euery indifferent Reader: The Lord of his mercy open our eyes, that we may diſcerne the truth, and our hearts, that we may loue it, and embrace it.
            
            
               
                  MOTIVE. II. That religion, which maintaines by the grounds thereof things forbidden, by all lawes both of God, of Nature, and of Man, cannot be the true religion: but ſuch is the religion of the Romane Church: Ergo.
               THe firſt propoſition in this reaſon is vnqueſtionable andMAIOR. without controuerſie: for the law of God is one part of

true religion, as the Goſpell is the other: and therfore whatſoeuer contradicts this law, is oppoſite vnto true religion, and ſo cannot be true religion it ſelfe: for truth is not oppoſite vnto truth, but falſhood: and the lawe of nature is nothing but the law of God, engrauen in the hearts of all men by the inſtinct of nature, which Tullie calleth a lawe engendred, notCic. pro Milon. Lex nota non data. impoſed, borne with vs, not laid vpon vs. And the poſitiue laws of men, if they be good, are nothing els but extracts out of the law of God, & characters of the law of nature. That religion therefore that croſſeth all theſe lawes by allowance of ſuch things, which are by them all condemned, cannot in any wiſe be the true religion, but muſt needs ſtand guilty of falſhoode and errour. Now, that the Romiſh religion is ſuchMINOR. (which is the ſecond propoſition in the reaſon) that is my taske to proue, and I hope I ſhall by inuincible arguments make good the ſame.
               1. And firſt, what can bee more contrary to the lawes ofI. God, of Nature, of Man, then treaſon and rebellion againſt Princes? for the lawe of God commandeth ciuill obedience to the Magiſtrate, by the firſt precept of the ſecond Table: and our Sauiour in the Goſpell biddeth to giue to Caeſar thoſe
                  Matth. 22. 2
                        •
                     . 
                  things that belong vnto Caeſar: and Saint Paul chargeth euery ſoule to be ſubiect to the higher powers, becauſe all power is of God:
                  Rom. 13. 
                        •
                     . euen tyrannicall power, as our Sauiour confeſſeth to Pilate: Thou hadſt no power ouer mee, except it was giuen thee from aboue:
                  Ioh. 19. 11. where he acknowledgeth, that Pilates power (though he was a tyrant) was of God; and therefore ſubmitteth himſelfe vnto it. As for the law of nature, it requireth as much of all; for as in the bodie naturall, all the outward members and inward faculties are gouerned by reaſon, reſiding in the head, and in the body oiconomike, all the familie is directed by the Father or Maſter thereof: ſo in the body politique, all the members of a Common-wealth muſt by natures decree be obedient to the King or gouernour, whom to reſiſt, is to rebell againſt nature, as it is againſt nature for the member to mutiny againſt the head; or for children and ſeruants to be diſobedient to their Fathers or Maſters: Neither are the

lawes poſitiue any whit behinde: for no offence by lawe is more ſeuerely puniſhed, then crimen laeſae Maieſtatis, that is, high treaſon againſt the Kings perſon or State: and that not onely in this our Kingdome, but in all others, as is ſufficiently knowen.
               2. Now, that the Romiſh doctrine and religion is a ſupporter of treaſon, and an animater of traytors againſt their Soueraignes; I call to witneſſe, firſt, their owne principles, and ſecondly, their practice. Their principles are theſe: As
                  Toll. Inſtr. Sacer. lib. 1. cap. 13. 
                  long as the Prince continueth excommunicate, the Subiect is freed from the oath of ſubiection: this is the Poſition of a Cardinall, whoſe authority was ſo great in the Church of Rome, that whatſoeuer he wrote, was allowed as ſound and authenticall, without examination or ſupervizing. To him I adde aSimanc. Inſt. lib. 23. Sect. 11. Biſhop, whoſe writings, after ſuperviſion and examination, were approued as Catholique doctrine, and to containe in them nothing contrary to the receiued faith of the Romane Church: his Poſition is this, Aſſoone as a Chriſtian King becomes hereticall, forthwith people are freed from their ſubiection. The condition in the firſt Poſition is, if the King be excommunicate: in the ſecond, if he be hereticall; which though different in termes, yet in ſubſtance are all one, for euery heretique is excommunicate, quatenus apertè haereticus, in thatVal. Ieſ. tom. 
                        •
                     . in Them. diſp. 1. qu. 12. he is an open heretique, if not by name, yet in deed, and by right, and ſo Subiects may lawfully deny him obedience, ſaith another Ieſuite: and what is an hereticke in their diuinity,Alph. de Caſt. l. 1. de iuſt. punit. haer. cap. 10. I pray you? Marry, Whoſoeuer maintaineth any doctrine expreſly condemned by the Church of Rome, hee is to be accounted (ſay they) an obſtinate hereticke. To theſe adde the ſentence of another Cardinall, euen our owne Countriman Al- in his Apology for Stanlies treaſon, who ioyneth both theſe two conditions together as two twinnes. By reaſon (ſaith he)
                     Cardinal Allen. 
                  of Queene Elizabeths excommunication and hereſie, it was not onely lawfull for any of her Subiects, but euen they were bound in conſcience, to depriue her of any ſtrength, which lay in their power to doe, and to deliuer her Armies, Townes, or fortreſſes into her enemies hands, ſhe no more being the right owner of them. But

all this while we haue not the pillar of Popery, Bellarmine, it may be he is of another mind: heare therefore his reſolution. Non licet Chriſtianis tolerare, &c. It is not lawfull for
                  Bell. de Rom. pōt. lib. 5 cap. 7. 
                  Chriſtians to tolerate a King that is an infidell, or an heretike, if he endeuour to draw his Subiects to his hereſie or infidelity. This is braue Bellarmines reſolution of this caſe. Neither doth he barely ſet it downe, but laboureth to proue it by many arguments throughout that whole Chapter: indeed he pinneth it all vpon the Popes ſleeue; he muſt pronounce the King to be an heretike, and they like ſheepe muſt auoyde him as a wolfe; he muſt forbid them to obey, and they muſt forthwith fall to rebellion: that whole ſeuenth Chapter is worth the reading, if any deſire to know the full and compleat doctrine of the Romiſh Church, concerning the poynt of rebellion and treaſon againſt Princes. And that this was the doctrine not of ſome few among them, but of all in generall: Let a Fryer ofSigebert. Chron. Anno 1088. their owne teſtifie about three hundred yeares ſince; Sigebert mencioning the Popes proceeding againſt Henry the Emperor, thus writeth; Be it ſpoken with the leaue of all good men, this nouelty, that I ſay not hereſie, had not as yet ſprung vp in the world, that Gods Prieſts ſhould teach the people that they owe no ſubiection to euill Princes, and though they haue ſworne allegeance to them, yet they owe them no fidelity, neither ſhall hee be accounted periur'd which thinketh againſt the King, yea, hee that obeyeth him ſhall be counted for excommunicate, and he that doth againſt him ſhall be abſolued from the guilt of iniuſtice and periurie. Here we may behold the doctrine of that age, and withall, that by this Fryers iudgement concurring with vs, it is not onely nouelty, but a point of hereſie to diſſolue the bond of allegeāce, which Subiects owe vnto their Princes, vpon any pretence whatſoeuer.
               3. But all theſe are but the opinions of priuate men, and not the decrees of the Church: heare therefore what the Church ſpeaketh, by the pretended head thereof the Pope, who (as they affirme) cannot erre whileſt he ſits in the chaire of Peter, to determine matters of faith.

King of England, and commanded his nobles to beare armes againſt him: and to make vp the full ſquadron of Popes, when as the Vniuerſite of Salamanca determined, that all Catholiques which did not forſake the defence of the Engliſh, and follow the traytor One all in Ireland, did ſinne mortally, and could not obtaine euerlaſting life, except they ſhould deſiſt: Pope Xiſtus giueth this cenſure of their determination,Lib. de iuſta abdic. Hen. 3. pa. 370. 
                  Thoſe Diuines (ſaith he) haue done the parts of good Lawyers, Confeſſours, and Doctours. Many more teſtimonies to this effect might be accumulated, but theſe are ſufficient (becauſe wee ſhall haue occaſion to ſpeake hereof more at large hereafter) to all that are not either bewitched with the enchantments of the whore of Babylon, or blinded with preiudice, to ſhew how both in their principles and their practice, they maintaine treaſon and rebellion againſt Princes, contrary to the lawes of God, of nature, and of man.
               4. A doctrine Couſin german vnto this, & of the ſame kind,2. though not of the ſame degree, is that their Poſition touching the diſſoluing of all bonds of naturall and ciuill ſociety: wherby they reſolue, that no communion or fellowſhip is to bee held with heretiques, that is, with Proteſtants, by whatſoeuer bond of nature or ciuility they be obliged therevnto: and therefore the Father is bound to diſ-inherite and caſt off his Sonne, the Sonne to deny and diſobey his Father, the wife is forbidden to render due beneuolence to her husband, the ſeruant is commanded to diſobey his Maſter, the debter to deny payment to his Creditor, the Countriman to deny his owne Country, the kinſman to diſclaime his kindred, if any of theſe be heretiques, that is, be Proteſtants. What a religion is this, that not only choaketh the breath of humane ſociety, but euen ſtifleth the life of nature it ſelfe? Hee that deſireth to ſee theſe things proued, let them reade Doctor Mortons
                  
firſt Booke of Romiſh poſitions and practices of rebellion, and alſo his reply vnto the moderate anſwere, where he ſhall find them largely and foundly diſcouered and confirmed.
               5. Againe, by their doctrine of equiuocation, they teach and maintaine open and notorious lying and periury, ſuch as the very heathen of ſtricter life and ſimpler iudgement abhor'd: their doctrine is this; A man (ſaith Tollet) is not alwaies
                  Toll. li. 4. de Iuſt. Sacerd. ca. 21. 
                  bound to anſwere according to the meaning of the asker, but may ſometimes vſe equiuocation, and deceiue the hearer: this is lawfull (ſaith he) whē the Iudge requireth an oth againſt iuſtice, or when he is not a competent Iudge (as another ſpeaketh:) as for example, if the Iudge demand, Haſt thou done this? he may anſwere, I haue not (though he haue) with this ſecret meaning, to tell it thee, or at this time, or ſome ſuch like things. And if an husband aske his wife whether ſhee be an adultereſſe, ſhe may anſwere no (though ſhe be) with this mentall reſeruation [to reueale it to him] and if a man be conſtrained to ſweare that he will take a woman to his wife, he may doe it ſafely although he neuer meane it, with this cloſe clauſe in his mind (if ſhe ſhall after pleaſe him.) Thus farre Tollet.
               
               6. Now of late dayes, one hath divulged a whole Treatiſe in defence of this monſtrous doctrine; to the which Blackwell the Arch-prieſt hath giuē this ſolemne approbatiō, that it is a very godly, learned & Catholique Tractate, & worthy to be publiſhed in print, to the comfort of the afflicted, & inſtructiō of the godly. The author of this Tractate thus concludeth, If a Catholike or any other perſon ſhal be demanded vpon his oath before a Magiſtrate, whether a Prieſt be in ſuch a place, he may (though hee know the contrary) ſecurely in conſcience anſwere, No, without periury, with a ſecret meaning reſerued in his mind, namely, that he is not there, ſo as a man is bound to reueale him. Againe, if one ſhall aske me whether ſuch a ſtranger lyeth in my houſe, I may anſwere, he lyeth not in my houſe (albeit he do) meaning Non mentitur: this laſt is verball equiuocation, the former is mentall reſeruation, which are the two approued kindes of their equiuocating art.
               7. If this filthy ſtrumpet be not the mother of two foule

daughters, Lying, and Periury: lying, if by a bare aſſeueration; periury, if ioyned with an othe: let all that haue but common ſenſe and reaſon iudge, and let the Enqueſt that ſhall enquire into this matter be, firſt, heathen Philoſophers; ſecondly, the Popiſh writers themſelues; thirdly, the Fathers and Doctours of the Church; and fourthly, which is of greater moment then all the reſt, the holy Scripture of God diuinely inſpired, and cannot deceiue, nor be deceiued. Let vs heare the Philoſophers verdict; A Lye, ſaith Tully, is a falſe
                  Tullie. 
                  enunciation of words, with an intent to deceaue: and againe, he defines dolus malus, that is, deceit to be, when one thing is
                  Cic. de offic. 3. 
                  pretended, another acted; this is a falſe action. So, in like manner a falſe diction, which is, a lye, muſt needs bee when one thing is ſpoken by the mouth, another vnderſtood in the heart: therefore the ordinary Grammaticall notation of this word mentiri, to lye, is quaſi contra mentemire, as it were to goe againſt the minde: and Ariſtotle ſayth, that ſpeech is ordained
                  Ariſt. de interpr. 
                  for this cauſe, to ſignifie and expreſſe the ſecret conceptions of the mind: therfore when the mouth and the mind are at variance, then the law of nature is peruerted, and in ſtead of a naturall and true-borne childe Truth, a baſtard, to wit, a lye is produced: But they which equiuocate, pretend one thing, and intend another; they ſpeake one thing, & meane another; their heart and their tongue, like vntuned ſtrings, are at iarre with themſelues, and therefore by no meanes can they be excuſed from open and notorious lying.
               8. Now, if an oath bee mixed, then a fouler monſter isToll. de Sept. peccat. cap. 54. brought forth, euen Periury; for what is periurie, but according to their own diuinity, a lye made in an oath? and is not equiuocating, when the equiuocator is ſworne to ſpeake the truth, periury? Let Tully determine this doubt, if it bee a doubt, Not to ſweare a falſhood, is to bee forſworne, but not to
                  Cic. de offic. 3. 
                  performe or make good that which thou hast ſworne according to thine owne meaning, as cuſtomably it is conceiued by thy words, is periury: all the world cannot more directly cut the throat of all equiuocation then this doth.
               9. But I leaue the Philoſophers, and come to their owne

Schoolemen. To lye (ſaith Lumbard) is when a man ſpeaketh
                  
                     Lum. l. 3. diſt. 38 
                  any thing contrary to that which he thinketh in his mind. It is a lye (ſaith Aquinas) when a man will ſignifie another thing, then
                  
                     Aqui. 2. 2. q. 111. art. 1. Lum. l. 3. diſt. 39 
                  that which he thinketh in his mind. Againe, Lumbard. Whoſocuer vſeth craft or ſubtiltie in an oath, defileth his conſcience with a double guilt, for he both taketh the name of God in vaine, and alſo deceiueth his neighbour. And Aquinas, their great Doctor, condemneth in expreſſe words this equiuocating tricke of theirs: If a Iudge (ſaith he) ſhall require any thing which he
                  Aqui. 2. 2. 4. 69. art. 1. 
                  cannot by order of law, the party accuſed, (what, may he equiuocate?) No. he is not bound to anſwere (in deed) but either by appeale, or ſome other meanes, may deliuer himſelfe; but in no caſe may be tell a lye, or vſe falſhood, or any kind of craft or deceit. This was then good diuinity: but now the Ieſuites, our pretended reſiners of Popery, haue coyned a new kind of diuinity; but like counterſet ſlips, it will not abide the tryall. Heare what Scotus ſaith, another Schooleman, Dicere non feci,
                  
                     Scotus lib. 5. de inſt. q. 6. art. 2. 
                  &c. To ſay I did not that, which I know I haue done, although I ſpeake it with this reſeruation (that I may ſignifie it to you) is not equiuocation, but a plaine lye. To conclude with Maldonate,

                        •
                     . v. 28. 
                  Quiſquis fingendo, &c. Whoſoeuer (ſaith he) by ſaining doth goe about to deceiue another, although he intend ſome other thing in his mind, without doubt, lyeth; for otherwiſe there would be no lye, which might not by this meanes be defended.
               
               10. Thus we haue the verdict of diuers of their own Writers, touching this monſtrous doctrine. Let vs heare now what the Fathers thinke of it, and let Saint Hierome ſpeake firſt: None is a lyer (ſaith he) but he that thinks otherwiſe then
                  Hieron. in 1. ad Corinth. ca. 4. 
                  he ſpeaketh. Therfore the equiuocator is a lyar, for he thinketh otherwiſe then he ſpeaketh: as when he affirmeth (I am no Prieſt) when he is one, he thinketh hee is that which he ſaith he is not. Is Saint Auguſtine of a contrary minde? no, hee agreeth with Hierome in this, though they iarred in ſome other things. He that ſpeaketh (ſaith he) falſly againſt his conſcience,
                  Aug. li. contramend. cap. 5. 
                  doth properly lye, but ſo doth our equiuocator. And for Periury, This (ſaith Auguſtine) is the very forme of Periurie,
                  
                     Idem Serm. 28. de verbis Apoſl.
                   
                  to thinke that to be falſe which thou doſt ſweare. Thus doth

the equiuocatour, for when hee ſweareth hee knoweth not a man, and yet knoweth him, doth hee not manifeſtly thinke that to be falſe which he ſweareth? his mentall reſeruation cannot ſaue him from the pillory; ſeeing, as Iſidore ſaith, God
                  
                     Iſi lor. de ſummo bono. li. 1. ca. 13. 
                  doth valew an oath not by the ſenſe of the ſpeaker, but according to the ſenſe of him to whom the oath was made. Thus by the verdict of theſe three Fathers, their doctrine of equiuocation is guilty both of lying and periury.
               11. And that I may leaue them without a ſtarting hole, let them heare what the Iury of Life and Death ſaith, I meane the holy Prophets and Apoſtles, yea, what GOD the Iudge himſelfe ſaith. Thou ſhalt not (ſaith he) Beare falſe witneſſe againſt thy Neighbour: No, nor of thy neighbour: therfore much leſſe againſt thy ſelfe, or of thy ſelfe: but the equiuocatour doth both: firſt, againſt his Neighbonr, when by a falſe ſuggeſtion he perſwadeth him to beleeue an vntruth; and of his neighbour, when hee reporteth that of him which is vntrue: and ſecondly, of, and againſt himſelfe, by confeſſing himſelfe to be that which he is not, or denying himſelfe to be that which hee is. Equiuocation then is a plaine breach of this Commandement, and therefore a lye at the leaſt. The Prophet Ieremy interpreting this precept, as the manner of the Prophets was, giues it affirmatiuely thus, Thou ſhalt ſweare in
                  Ierem. 4. 1. Pſal. 15. 
                  truth, &c. And the Prophet Dauid ſaith, that the righteous man ſpeakes in truth. Now, what is it to ſweare or ſpeake in truth, Azorius the Ieſuite will tell vs, that It is either for the confirmation
                  Azor. li. 11. mor, cap. 2. 
                  of a truth, or in a probable opinion of that to be true which we ſweare or ſpeake. But the equiuocatours ſpeach or oath is neither for the truth, nor from the truth, and therefore a lye, if not groſſe periury. Againe, the Prophet Dauid ſets downe this as one note of a righteous man, that he ſpeakes the truth
                  Pſal. 15. 
                        •
                     . 
                  from his heart: but the Equiuocatour either ſpeaketh not the truth at all, or at leaſt ſpeaketh not from the heart, whereby he is euidently conuinced to be none of thoſe that ſhall dwell in Gods Tabernacle, or aſend into his holy Mountaine. Laſtly, when as Saint Paul was taxed by ſome falſe brethren to be carnally minded, becauſe promiſing to come to Corinthus,
                  
he came not, doth he excuſe himſelfe by equiuocation, ſaying, that he promiſed one thing and minded another? no, but he proteſteth that he was minded as hee ſpake, and that his
                  2. Cor. 1. 13. 
                  word was not yea, and nay, but ſimply yea: which proueth, firſt, that all our ſpeach muſt be ſimple and plaine, without equiuocation: and ſecondly, that ſuch as abuſe their ſpeach in ſuch ſort, are fleſhly minded men, full of lightneſſe and vanity. And thus we haue a full verdict of Philoſophers, Popiſh diuines, Fathers, and Scriptures: and therefore why may not ſentence bee pronounced, and the equiuocator adiudged guilty both of lying and periury, two ſinnes which the law of God, of Nature, and Men, haue alway condemned?
               12. Againe, what more contrary to the lawe of God and4. man, then adultery and fornication? But the religion of the Church of Rome doth directly maintaine and allow both theſe, by tolerating Stewes, places of common whoredome, & open and knowne Strumpets proſtituted to filthineſſe, and that not onely in all other places of the Popes Dominion, but euen in Rome, vnder his Holineſſes owne noſe, and by his authentical approbation; neither can this be imputed vnto them as a corruption in manners onely, and not as an errour in doctrine: for they not onely vphold theſe places and perſons of infamy by their practice, and winke at them by neglect of due execution of iuſtice, but they are growne to that impudency, that they allow, maintaine, and approue them by their doctrine, as things neceſſary and commodious in a Common wealth: and albeit they condemne them generally as ſinnes, yet they approue them againe as neceſſary and profitable: as if there were any neceſſary profit, or profitable neceſſity of ſinnes, which Saint Paul calleth the vnfruitfull workes of darkneſſe, Epheſ. 5. 11. And thus with their owne mouthes they condemne themſelues in that which they allow, being Iudges ofRom 14. 22. themſelues, and proclaimers of their owne ſhame.
               13. Their doctrine is this, that a leſſer euill is to bee permitted, to the end that a greater may be auoyded, and therefore brothel houſes to be ſuffered, leſt all places ſhould bee filled with filthy luſts: and this their poſition they defend;

firſt, by the teſtimonie of Saint Auguſtine in his Booke De Ordine; ſecondly, by deprauing and corrupting that place of Scripture, where it is forbidden that there ſhould bee anyDeut. 23. 17. harlot in Iſrael; thirdly, by diuers reaſons, to wit, if harlots were ſuffered to be free and at liberty, without theſe Stewes, they would ſinne more licenciouſly, and that by their firſt reſtraint to that one place, they may be made aſhamed, and ſo at length conuerted, and that knowne harlots are to be tolerated, leſt violence ſhould be offered vnto honeſt Matrons; and laſtly, they are not aſhamed to reckon whoredome and fornication amongſt thoſe things which of their owne nature are not euill, becauſe the Apoſtles place it among things of thatActs 15. 20. nature, to wit, bloud, things ſtrangled, and things dedicated vnto Idols. Theſe bee their goodly reaſons whereby they maintaine Stewes; but no maruaile if they maintaine them, ſeeing their holy Father the Pope is in ſome ſort maintained by them. The Romiſh harlots pay (ſaith Agrippa) vnto the Pope
                  Agrippa de vanit. cap. 64. 
                  euery wecke a Iuly (which is a certaine kind of Coyne) for their liberty, they prophane Gods word by a filthy Comment: for take away (ſay they) harlots out of the Common-wealth, and all places will abound with whoredomes: whereas, neuertheleſſe the Common-wealths of Iſrael endured long without that ſtain, where notwithſtanding an harlot was not permitted. It is recorded alſo, that the harlots in Rome pay vnto the Pope a yearely penſion, which amounteth ſometimes to thirtie thouſand, ſometimes to fortie thouſand Ducats. Pope Paulus the third is ſaid to haue had in his Tables the names of 45000. Curtezans, which payd a monethly tribute vnto him. And therefore not without great cauſe (if gaine may be a ſufficient cauſe) did Pope Sixtus build a noble or famous Stewes at Rome, as Agrippa
                  Agrip. ibid. nobile lupanar Romae. witneſſeth: for, ſeeing ſuch large reuenewes ariſe to the holy Fathers purſe, by the meanes of ſtrumpets, why ſhould they not be there maintained? where, not as Saint Paul ſaith, godlineſſe is gaine, but gaine is godlineſſe, and all Religion is turned into lucre, as Mantuan a Fryer Carmelite of their owne ſaith,

But I would faine know how theſe holy Fathers can free themſelues from the name and imputation of notorious bawdes; ſeeing he is by all law eſteemed a bawde, that maintaineth harlots, expoſing them to the luſt of others for gaine, then which, what can be more vilde and baſe?
               14. As touching the teſtimony of Saint Auguſtine, and their other reaſons, I anſwere in a word; firſt, that when Saint Auguſtine wrote that Booke, he was but Catecheumenus, a nouice in Religion, not well inſtructed in Chriſts Schoole: and beſides that, it doth croſſe the doctrine both of himſelfe in other Books of more mature iudgement, and alſo of the holy Scripture; for he himſelfe affirmeth elſewhere, that the good which commeth of euil as a recompence, muſt not be admitted, and the Scripture condemneth to hell all thoſe (marke, you Romaniſts) that ſay, Let vs doe euill, that good may come thereof,
                  Rom. 3. 8. 
                  whoſe damnation is iuſt.
               
               15. Their other reaſons are vaine and idle: for what greater liberty can they deſire, then to be authorized by the head of the Church, who cannot erre as they teach, and to follow their filthy luſts by letters Patents frō his vnholyneſſe? (for ſo here it iuſtly deſerueth to be tituled.) And is this the way to reclaime & conuert them frō their filthines, to dwell in gorgious houſes, to ride opēly in goodly chariots, to be apparelled like Princes, to haue attēding on them men clad in braue attire, with chaines of gold and coſtly ornaments, yea, to be maintained by the Pope, and often viſited by his Holyneſſe and his great Cardinals? if this be the way to reclaime them,

let all men of ſound ſenſe and reaſon iudge indifferently.
               16. Laſtly, whether it be a meanes to ſtoppe the courſe of luſt, and to refraine whoredomes from ſpreading farre and wide: let vs againſt Auguſtine oppoſe Saint Baſill,
                  Baſil. commen. in Pſalm. who expounding theſe words of the Pſalme: And hath not ſit in the chaire of peſtilence, ſaith, That whoredome ſtayeth not it ſelfe in one man, but inuadeth a whole Citie: for ſome one comming to an harlot, taketh to himſelfe a fellow, and the ſame alſo ſeekth another fellow: and ſo, as a fire being kindled in a Citie, ſtayeth not in the burning one houſe or two, but ſpreadeth farre and wide, and draweth a great deſtruction with it: ſo this miſchiefe being once kindled, rangeth ouer all the Citie. Oppoſe alſo to him Saint Ambroſe, who writingAmbr. omment in Pſal. 119. vpon the 119. Pſalme, thus ſayth; Who can nouriſh burning 
                        ••
                     ales in his boſome, and not bee burnt with them? So how can harlots be nouriſhed in a Citie, and young men not bee corrupted with wheredome? Yea, oppoſe Tertullian alſo, whoTertul. de anim

Authentikes, in the Title De Lenonibus, willeth that harlots ſhould bee vtterly baniſhed out of the Citie: and ſorroweth, becauſe hee ſaw Brothel-houſes ſo nigh vnto the Churches of God. And indeed, if it were true, that it is a meane to reſtraine whoredome, why is it not then reſtrained at Rome, by that meanes? I am ſure they haue their Stewes: And yet Mantuan doubteth not to affirme, that for all their Stewes confined into one place, Vrbs estiam tota lupanar: The whole Citie was become a Stewes. To conclude all in one briefe Sylogiſme, That Religion which is contrary to the Religion of God, cannot bee of God, but of the Deuill; but the Romiſh Religion in this one poynt is contrary to the Religion of God; for the Scripture ſaith, There ſhall be no whore

                  in Iſrael; the Romaniſts ſay, There muſt be whores in Iſrael, that is, in the Church, for the auoyding of a further miſchiefe (then which what can be more contradictorie?) therefore the Romiſh religion cannot be of God, but of the diuell, I meane, in thoſe poynts wherein it thus croſſeth the truth of God.
               
                  17. But doe they ſtay at adultery and ſimple fornication?5. No, their religion maintaineth open and notorious inceſt, and ſuch as the better ſort of the heathen abominated; and this they doe by three doctrines: firſt, by that which giueth allowance, at leaſt wiſe toleration to common Stewes and brothel-houſes, for the auoyding of a further miſchiefe, as I haue declared in the former Section: for Stewes cannot be tolerated, but inceſt alſo needs muſt not onely be occaſioned, but euen after a ſort approued; the reaſon is, becauſe often it commeth to paſſe, that the Father and the Sonne, or two brethren and neere kindred are defiled with one and the ſame woman, and ſo vnnaturall and horrible inceſt, prohibited by the lawes of God and man, is commited. And albeit, oftentimes this is a thing ſecret and vnknowne vnto them: yet it doth not waſh their conſciences from the guilt of this foule crime, becauſe they are bound to know in what degree ſhe is vnto them, of whome they dare preſume to haue carnall knowledge. And beſides, the act it ſelfe being meerely vnlawfull, doth take away all excuſe; together, with a ſecret ſuſpition they ſhould haue, if they be not wilfully ignorant, that ſuch a thing might be. For if that rule of Saint Auguſtine beeAuguſt. de ciuit. lib. 15. good, 
                     Ʋitandum eſt licitum propter vicinitatem illiciti: that which is lawfull is often to be auoyded, for the contiguity and neereneſſe it hath with that which is vnlawfull: how much more is this true, that a thing vnlawfull in it owne nature is to be prohibited and auoyded, not onely becauſe it is vnlawfull; but much more if it bring with it apparāt feare of a greater miſchiefe? Now that affinitie is contracted, and therefore inceſt committed, not onely by lawfull marriage, but alſo by vnlawfull copulation: I thinke no man doubteth, ſeeing that Saint Paul plainely affirmeth, That hee which cleaueth to an

               18. Their ſecond doctrine maintaining Inceſt, is their opinion touching the Popes power in diſpenſations: for they hold, that hee being Chriſts Vicar on earth, may diſpenſe in

degrees expreſly prohibited by Gods law, and ſo hath andOccaſio L

Duke of Auſtria, married each of them their ſiſters daughters. And Petrus Aluaradus married two ſiſters at once, and ſuch like, as you may ſee more at large in the former demonſtration. What is this, I pray you, but to allowe and authorize inceſt? when as they aſcribe vnto their holy Father the Pope authority to diſpenſe with it: for according to the old rule in Logike, Cauſa cauſae, est cauſa cauſati, which is, the cauſe of the cauſe, muſt needes bee alſo the cauſe of the effect: when as their doctrine therfore vpholds the Popes power to diſpenſe, and this power to diſpenſe, brings forth Inceſt, a baſtardly brat; by conſequēt their doctrine muſt neceſſarily ſtand guilty

               19. The third doctrine by which this ſoule ſinne is authorized, is the generall opinion of the Church, touching the extent of degrees of Conſanguinity prohibited in marriage: for, albeit in former ages it was forbidden to marrie within the ſeuenth degree: yet in the Councill of Laterane,
                  Concil. Later. cap. 10. that Pontificall conſtitution was abrogated and the prohibition of marriage reſtrained to the fourth degree incluſiuely: ſo, that beyond the fourth degree it might be lawfull for any to marry without exception. Which conſtitution is at this day held for Authenticall, and is of force in the Romane Church: now this doth giue manifeſt allowance vnto Inceſt. for whether the ſupputation be made after the rule of the Ciuill law by generations, or of the Canon law by perſons: yet ſo

                  e caſes cannot be cleared from Inceſt; for this is the rule of ſupputation by the Canon law, which is moſt fauourable to them; Quo gradu remotior distat à communi ſtipite, eodem etiam inter ſe diſtant. In what degree the perſon furth

                  20. Againe, who knoweth not but that theft is condemned by all lawes, except it be by the lawes of Platoes imaginaries Cōmon-wealth, or the Anabaptiſtical poſitions of ſome later heretikes, who would haue propriety of goods taken away, and a communitie of all things brought vp? but the Papiſts by their doctrine not onely tolerate ſome kind of theft, but euen maintaine and allowe it as lawfull: For, thus writeth Maldonate a learned Ieſuite, and of great authoritie; Poore

And to prooue this, hee abuſeth an excellent ſentence of Saint Ambroſe, who ſpeaking of the communitieAmbroſe. of charitie, and not of propriety, ſaith, Eſurientis pauis eſt, quem

It is the poores bread which thou retaineſt, his garment which thou lockeſt vp, and his money which thou hy deſt in the ground. But he ſpeaketh, as any man may ſee, not to encourage the poore to lay hands vpon rich mens ſubſtance, but to ſtirre vp the rich to the workes of charitie: neither to excuſe a poore man from theft, if he ſteale from the rich, but to accuſe the rich of theft, if out of his wealth he do not powre forth to the neceſſitie of the poore. Neither is this the opinion of one Ieſuite onely, but it is backed and barred by the approbation of another of no meane credite: For thus writeth Emanuel Sa: in his Aphoriſines.Eman. Sa. aph. page

                  Ego, inquit, &c. I (ſaith he) am of the ſame mind with them, which thinke that it is lawfull for a poore man priuily to purloine from a richman, which is bound to helpe him and doth not. Here be two brethren in euill, concurring in the defence of one and the ſame ſinne; for if to ſteale, be not an offence for a poore man, why doth the law ſay in generall, Thou ſhalt not ſteale? Let them ſhew the exception and exemption of the poore from the law; or let them confeſſe to their eternall ſhame, that they are maintainers of thoſe that breake Gods law. Beſides, if (as Saint Auguſtine, and all other learned Diuines confeſſe)

                  it bee not lawfull to lye, though it bee to the ſauing of our
                  Auguſt. de mendac. ca. 13. 
                  liues: then it muſt needs follow, that it is not lawfull for a poore man to ſteale, though it be for the ſauing of his life: for theft is a ſinne that bringeth more damage with it, then an officious lye can doe, which is vttered not for hurt of another, but for the preſeruation of our ſelues.
               21. Beſides theſe, Cardinall Tollet another Ieſuite, a man of high dignity and authority in the Romane Church, approueth by his verdict another kind of theft, worſe then thoſe before ſpecified; for he alloweth in ſome caſes the vſe of falſe ballances, and falſification of wares, his words are theſe.

                     n his meaſure, or mingle water with his wines, and ſo ſell it for pure wine, and require the full price, as if the meaſure were compleate: prouided that he doe not lye, which neuertheles if he doe, it is no pernitious lye, nor mortall, nor binding to reſtitution. In like manner, it is lawfull to ſell other ſilke in ſtead of Granado ſilke, and Italian in ſtead of Greeke: and ſo after the ſame proportion all other wares.

contradictory theſe plaine precepts and enunciatiue propoſitions of Gods word, are vnto the poſitions of the Cardinall, no man can but diſcerne that is not bewitched with the ſo

                  cerie of Iezabel: either therefore let him ſhew out of holy writ ſome exception from theſe generall rules, or let him acknowledge his Doctrine and Religion, to be the vpholder of moſt groſſe and palpable theft.
               22. If any man ſay that theſe be the opinions of priuate men, and not the doctrine of the Church: I anſwere, that this is a moſt friuolous conceit, for none of their bookes are admitted to the preſſe, before they be examined by certaine Cenſurers deputed to that purpoſe by the Church: and if any thing diſlike them or ſeeme to ſauour of hereſie (as they call the trueth) preſently it is either gelded out, or corrected at their pleaſures. And that which goeth for currant, hath his allowance ſubnexed. That it containeth in it nothing contrary to the Catholike faith of the Church of Rome. Theſe poſitions then of theſe Ieſuites ſtanding thus approued by the common conſent of their Cenſurers, and priuiledged to be both printed and read of all men, as containing nothing contrary to wholeſome doctrine, cannot be thought to be the vnaduiſed opinions of priuatemen, but euen the doctrine and religion of their Church.
               23. Laſtly, that I may conclude this ſecond argument,7. they maintaine alſo the prophanation of the Sabboth, which the Lord hath enioyned to be ſanctified with ſo great and vrgent a precept: Remember that thou keepe holy the Sabboth day. Adding

                  vpon paine of a mortall ſinne to ſanctifie the Sabboth, but is not bound vnder the ſame paine to ſanctifie it well. As if forſooth it could be ſanctified at all, if it be not well ſanctified: or as if the prophanation of the Sabboth were the ſanctifying of it:

for not to ſanctifie it well, is nothing elſe but to prophane it: howbeit, if this were all the iniurie hee doth to Gods Sabboth, it might be borne withall: but the bold Cardinall taketh vpon him to breake in pieces the barres thereof, and to expoſe it being the Lords day, and therefore fit to bee employed onely in the Lords worke, to moſt vile and baſe offices; for thus hee writeth in the ſame booke. Licet iter facere, &c. It is lawfull to take a iourney on the feaſt day: (with this caueat, that diuine ſeruice be firſt heard.) It is lawfull to hunt, and doe ſuch like things. It is lawfull for Iudges, eſpecially rurall, to giue iudgement on the feaſt day: it is no ſinne for a Barber to exerciſe his trade on the feaſt day for commodity, if he had no leaſure to doe it at another time: they are excuſed alſo which ſell fleſh, kill beaſts, and ſell neceſſary victuals on holy dayes: And if the occaſion of a great gayne would otherwiſe bee loſt, as in fiſhing for Herring and Tunnes, which come not but vpon certaine dayes, it is lawfull to fiſh on the holy day. In publique ſolemnities it is lawfull to prepare the wayes, and to build for ſpectacles. This is the doctrine of that renowned Cardinall, whoſe writings are ſo approued of the Church of Rome, that whatſoeuer hee ſpeaketh, is held for trueth. But here it may be anſwered, that he nameth not the Sabboth, but the feſtiuall or holy day: to which I anſwere: Firſt, that the title of that Chapter is de Sabbath
                        •
                     : and therefore if he meaneth not that, hee ſwarueth from his purpoſe. Secondly, that the expreſſe words and drift of the whole Chapter demonſtrates, that vnder the name of the feſtiuall or holy day, he includeth alſo the Sabboth. And thirdly, how could he giue inſtructions touching the caſes of the Sabboth, if he intended not the Sabboth, ſeeing all his rules runne vnder this generall terme, on the feſtiuall or holy day? This therfore is but a miſt to blinde mens eyes, that they might not ſee their impietie.
               24. Can this Religion (thinke you) be of God, which in thus many points croſſeth and trampleth vnder foote the law of God? Doth not the head of that congregation euidently ſhew himſelfe to be 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , that outlaw, which S. Paul ſpeaketh of, 2. Theſſ. 2. that is, ſuch an one as oppoſeth himſelfe

to the law of God? Doe not the necke and ſhoulder which are ſupporters of that head, I meane, the Cardinals and Biſhops, ſhew themſelues to be of the ſame nature and diſpoſition with it? and the whole body, which is quickned by the life of his doctrine, to be meerely Antichriſtian? He that ſeeth not this, is blinde, and cannot diſcerne a farre off; hee that ſeeth it and confeſſeth it not, is careleſſe of his owne ſaluation. Let vs leaue them therefore, either to bee conuerted, which God graunt for Chriſt his ſake, or to bee confounded, if they continue in their errours.
            
            
               
                  MOTIVE. III. That Religion which imitateth the Iewes in thoſe things wherin they are enemies to Chriſt, cannot bee the truth: but ſuch is the Religion of the Church of Rome. Ergo.
               THe malice of the Iewes towards Chriſt our Sauiour, andMAIOR. his Church, from the beginning vnto this day, is ſo notorious, that the whole world is witneſſe thereof. Saint Paul witneſſeth of them, that they killed the Lord Ieſus, and their
                  1. Theſ. 2. 15. 16 
                  owne Prophets, and perſecuted the Apoſtles, and were contrary to all men, and forbad them to preach vnto the Gentiles that they might be ſaued, to fulfill their ſinnes alwaies, and that the wrath of God was come vpon them to the vttermoſt. And as it was at that time, ſo euer ſince they haue not any whit remitted, but increaſed in their rancour; for ſtill they crucifie vnto themſelues the Lord of Life, though not in his perſon which is at the right hand of God; yet in his mēbers whō they perſecute vnto death aſmuch as in them lyeth, and in his Goſpel, which they ſtill purſue with a deadly hatred. Yea, ſo great is their malice, that many times they haue taken Chriſtian children, vpon their preparation day to the Paſſouer, and nailed them vpon the Croſſe, loaded them with reproaches and ſcornes, in diſgrace of Chriſt, and miſerably tormented them to death;

as was done by the Iewes of Inmeſter, a Towne ſcituate betwixtSocrat. Hiſt. lib. 7. cap. 16. 
                  Chalchis and Antiochia, as witneſſeth Socrates in his Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtory; and in Germany, at Fretulium; asJo. Finc. li. 3. Flores Hiſtor. alſo in England, at Lincolne and Norwich, as our Chronicles teſtifie. Yea, it is recorded how the Iewes of Hungarie tooke a Carpenters Son that was a Chriſtian, in deſpi
                     ••••
                   of Chriſt, whom they eſteemed no better then the Soone of a Carpenter, and cut all the veines of his body, and ſuckt out his bloud with quils: and being apprehended, and tortured, they confeſſed that they could not bee without Chriſtian bloud, for therewithall they anoynted their Prieſts. Yea, they haue often poyſoned the ſprings, and by that meanes brought great plagues vpon Chriſtian people; and ſet on fire Cities and Townes, to bring them to pouerty and miſery. Can there be greater enemies to Chriſt then theſe are? for the poyſoned arrowes of their malice are ſhut vp againſt him, who is in heauen beyond their reach, and therefore they fall downe vpon his members: but the venome of them lighteth vpon their owne heads, to their eternall confuſion. Who would now imitate theſe wretches in any thing, eſpecially in that wherein the cauſe of their enmity conſiſteth? can they be of God that doe this? or rather are they not the brood of that Serpent, that hath beene euer a profeſt enemy to the ſeed of the woman? This being ſo cleare and manifeſt, I leaue the firſt propoſition without any other guard or defence, and come to the confirmation of the ſecond, wherein the pith of the argument confiſteth.
               2. That the Religion of the Church of Rome is an apiſhMINOR. imitation of Iudaiſine, and that in thoſe things wherein it is moſt oppoſite to Chriſt, may appeare, if wee firſt conſider wherin the oppoſition of the Iewiſh Religion conſiſteth, and then ſecondly compare the Romiſh with the ſame. The Iewes Religion is oppoſite to Chriſt in two reſpects principally: firſt, in retaining the old Ceremonies of Moſes law, whichRom. 10. 4. Heb. 10. 1. were ſhadowes of things to come, and had their accompliſhment in Chriſt: for that which Paul ſaith concerning Circumciſiou, is to be vnderſtood of all other Ceremonies: They
                  
                  which entangle themſelues with that yoke of bondage, vnder
                  Gal. 4. 9. and 5 2. 4. 
                  thoſe impotent and beggerly rudiments, are aboliſhed from Chriſt, and Chriſt doth profit them nothing: And ſecondly, in deuiſing a multitude of ſtrange and new ſuperſtitions, coyned in the mint of their Rabbiniſh conceits, contrary not onely to the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt, but euen to their owne law, which Deutorologies of theirs our Sauiour condemneth, Math. 15. 3. 6. when hee ſaith, that they tranſgreſſed the CommaundementMatth. 15. 3. 6. of God, & made it of no effect by their owne tradition. Both theſe wayes ſhew they their enmity to Chriſt and Chriſtian Religion, and are thereby retained and encouraged in their errours.
               3. Now compare the Romiſh Religion with theſe Rabbiniſticall conceits in both reſpects, and it will appeare that one egge is not liker to another, nor milke to milke, then the Romiſh and Iewiſh ſuperſtition are to each other. And touchingI. the firſt, to begin with the multitude of their ceremonies: It is not vnknowne to any that know any thing in the booke of God, that the Church of the Iewes was loaden with a heauie burden of ceremonies. S. Paul ſaith, that it was ſo heauie,
                  Acts 15. 10. 
                  that neither they nor their fathers were able to beare it, and therefore calleth the Ceremoniall law, a yoke of bondage, andGal. 5. 1. and 4. 31. thoſe that were vnder that yoke, children of the bondwoman, and not of the free. And the reaſons why God did impoſe vpon them ſuch a number of Ceremonies, were iuſt and holy, to wit: firſt, becauſe the Church was then in the infancy, and therefore needed to be vnder a Schoolemaſter to inſtruct,Gal. 3. 24. and as it were catechize it vnto Chriſt, and therefore they were to be dealt withall, as children vſe to be with the guilded leaues and faire pictures of externall rites, and to be fed with milke, being not able to digeſt ſtrong meates. Secondly, becauſe by them they were, as it were by viſible repreſentations informed, both touching ſome great beneſit paſt and receiued, and touching the Meſſias to come and his Kingdome, as alſo concerning godly conuerſation required in their owne life: for in the barke of euery legall ceremonie, theſe three vitall ſpirits were contained. And thirdly (as it is

well obſerued by S. Chryſostome) in regard of their infirmityChryſoſt. and weakeneſſe, who being lately come out of Egypt, and there defiled themſelues with idolatrie and ſuperſtition, neceſſarily required ſacrifices and ceremonies to be allowed vnto them, leſt they ſhould fall backe againe to their Egyptian corruption: wherefore Almighty God (ſaith he) ſo dealt with them, as a Phyſician dealeth with his ſicke patient, who through the burning heat of his diſeaſe, requireth a cup of cold water, or elſe is ready to hang or kill himſelfe; there the Phyſician being conſtrained by neceſſity, commands a viole of cold water prepared by himſelfe, to be brought vnto him, but withall warnes him, that he drinke not but out of that Viole. So God granted ſacrifices and ceremonies to the ſickly Iſraelites, but ſo, that they ſhould not vſe any, but thoſe which hee appointed for them, and that after the manner by him preſcribed. And this to be ſo, hee proueth, becauſe the law of ceremonies was not giuen, vntill the children of Iſrael had defiled themſelues with the golden Calfe, for the making whereof they were ſo madde bent, as that they pulled off their Iewels, eare-rings, and rings from their bodies, and gaue them for the framing of that Idoll: and hee illuſtrateth the ſame in another place by another excellent ſimilitude. If a man (ſaith hee) haue a wife prone to incontinencie, hee ſhutteth her vp in certaine places & chambers, ſetting about her a guard of ſeruants and attendants, to keepe her from ſtraying abroad, and entertaining her louers. So God dealt with the Church of the Iewes, which he had married to himſelfe in compaſſion and loue, ſeeing it prone to Idolatry and ſuperſtition, hee ſeparated it from other Nations, and ſhut it vp within the bounds of the land of Canaan, and ſet about it a guard of Ceremonies and externall Rites, which ſhould be as it were Tutors vnto it, vntill it were fully confirmed in faith and obedience. Thus farre Chryſostome. By all which wee ſee not onely, that the Church of the Iewes was loaded with a bundle of ceremonies, which were to endure till the comming of the Meſſias: but alſo the reaſons why the Lord impoſed that burden vpon them.
               
                  4. Now is the Church of Rome any whit behinde them in this? No verily, but farre before them: for if we ſhall compare Moſes Leuiticus, with the Romiſh Miſſals, wee ſhall finde, that in number of ceremonies they farre exceede the Synagogue of the Iewes. The Iewes had but two great Sacraments: the Church of Rome haue ſeuen. The Iewes but one ordinary Altar: the Church of Rome tenne thouſand, euen as many as Churches, and not onely ſo, but often diuers Altars in one Church. The Iewes offered many ſacrifices, but the Church of Rome exceede them in the number of their Maſſes tenne to one. The Iewiſh Holy-dayes were few in compariſon of the Romiſh, for they had but their Paſſeouer, Pentecoſt, feaſt of Tabernacles, of Trumpets, reconciliation, new Moones, Purim and dedication: but theſe haue their Holy-dayes for euery Saint, for the Croſſe, Corpus Christi, All Saints, All Soules, and what not: inſomuch that their friend Eraſmus complaineth, that in Ieromes age there wereEraſ. in Mat. 11. few Holy-dayes beſides the Lords day: but now, that there is neither end nor meaſure in the multitude of them. The Iewes obſerued a few faſting dayes by Gods appointment, and others taken vp by their owne tradition, as the ſecond and fift day of the weeke: but the Romiſh faſts exceede both in number and ſuperſtition: for beſides two dayes in euery weeke, euery Saints Eue almoſt is a faſting day with them, beſides their Lent faſt continued whole ſixe weekes without intermiſſion, if to abſtaine from fleſh, and glut themſelues with other viands, as nutritiue to the body, be to be termed a faſt. The Iewes Prieſt-hood was diſtinguiſhed but into two maine orders, Prieſts and Leuites, and theſe later aſſigned to ſome few diſtinct offices about the Temple: but the Romiſh Prieſt-hood is peſtered with a ſwarme of the ſeuerall orders of Friars, Monkes, Anchorites, ſecular and regular Prieſts, that almoſt ſerue for nothing but to conſume the fruits of the earth. The holy garments for the Leuiticall Prieſt-hood, were but few in number in compariſon of the Romiſh veſtments: for the high Prieſt of the Iewes had but ſixe garments appointed to him; the Ephod, the breſt-plate, the Robe, the

linnen coate, the girdle, and the crowne; and for the inferiour Prieſts, but foure, linnen coats, bonnets, linnen breeches, and girdles: but the Romiſh haue ſixe garments in token of perfection; and the Biſhops nine, becauſe there are (as they ſay)Bonau. ratio. Diui. offic. li. 3. c. 1. nine orders of Angels; in all fifteene, anſwerable to the fifteene degrees of vertues. What ſhould I reckon vp their manifold croſſings, kiſſings, kneelings, whiſperings, waſhings, anoyntings, ſpittings, breathings, ſaltings, with an infinite number beſides of vaine and ſtrange obſeruations which are vſed in their Church, which the Iewiſh Synagogue may not compare withall, either for multitude or ſtrangeneſſe? And thus they are not onely equall to them, but farre exceed them in the number of their Ceremonies. And this is euenAgrip. de vanit. cap. 60. confeſſed by many of their fauourites: for Cornelius Agrippa ſaith, that Chriſtians are now more oppreſſed with ceremonies, then the Iewes were in former times.

                  Aug. Epiſt. 119. cap. 19.

                     re tolerable then the condition of Chriſtians, ſeeing they were ſubiect onely to Gods ordinances, and not to humane preſumptions as Chriſtians are. But if he had liued at this time, and ſeene the fruitfull multiplication of them, in reſpect of his age, how would hee haue complained? And thus in reſpect of multitude of Ceremonies, the Romiſh Church is by many degrees before the Church of the Iewes.
               
               5. To deſcend to particulars. The Iewes had their ſacrificing Prieſts, whereof one was their chiefe Prieſt, and the other of an inferiour ranke. The Romaniſts, in an apiſh imitation, haue their ſacrificing Prieſts too, the Pope their chiefe, and the vnder-ſhauelings his vaſſals: as if Aaron was a type of the Pope, and not of Chriſt; or as if all Chriſtians wereHeb. 8. 6. & 9. 6. 11. 12. 1. Pet. 2. 
                        •
                     . not Prieſts vnder the Goſpell; both which are euident in the new Teſtament: but we no where find that the high Prieſt

of Ieruſalem was a type of the high Prieſt of Rome, or that theReuel. 1. 6. Miniſters of the Goſpell are ſacrificing Prieſts. This latter isBel. de cultu ſanctor. lib. 3. ca. 4. confeſſed by Bellarmine, who ſaith that the Chriſtians of the Primitiue Church did purpoſely abſtaine from the names of Temple and Prieſthood, vntill the dayes of Tertullian, leſt that they ſhould ſeeme to haue retained ſome Iewiſh Ceremonies. Why then doe they now entertaine thoſe names, whereof the purer times were aſhamed? do they not ſhew thereby that they are degenerated from that primer purity, which they ſo much bragge of? And yet we doe not diſlike the name of Prieſt, if it bee rightly taken, for ſuch an one as miniſtreth in holy things betwixt God and the people, but that the Miniſters of the Goſpel ſhould be ſacrificing Prieſts, is Iewiſh; as alſo, that the man of Rome ſhould be the Arch-prieſt on earth, whereas we haue but one high Prieſt, euen Chriſt our Sauiour, who hauing once offered himſelfe a ſacrifice for ſinne, ſitteth for euer at the right hand of God. And that we may plainely ſee that in their Hierarchie they imitate the Iewes, Bellarmine is a ſufficient witneſſe, who to proue that there ought to be a viſible Monarch in the Church, alleageth that Aaron was not onely
                  Bell de Roman. Pontif. li. 1. ca. 9. 
                  a type of Chriſt, but alſo of the Pope, becauſe the ſacrifices of the law did not onely repreſent the bloudy ſacrifice of the Croſſe, but alſo the vnbloudy ſacrifice of the Maſſe. Which if it be true, then there can be but one high Prieſt in the Church of Chriſt, as there was but one in the Church of the Iewes: for the argument will ſtand thus in good moode and forme, being built vpon their owne ground. As the Church of the old Teſtament was gouerned, ſo ought the Church of the new: but the old was gouerned by one onely high Prieſt; therefore the new ought alſo to haue but one onely: for either he muſt ſhew that there were two high Prieſts in the Church of the Iewes, one ſubordinate vnto the other, or conuicted by his owne principle, he muſt acknowledge that there ought not to bee two in the Church of Chriſt, or at leaſt confeſſe that this argument is lame, drawne from the imitation of the Iewiſh Hierachy: and then if it be not true which he affirmeth, what will be the ſequell therof, but either ignorance in ſymbolizing thoſe things

which are no wiſe matches, or impiety in dethroning Chriſt from his office, and ſetting the Diademe vpon the Popes head; and ſo, that in their Romiſh Hierarchy they are the Iewes Apes, in that thing which moſt tendeth to the diſhonor of Chriſt.
               6. As they imitate the Iewiſh Prieſt-hood, ſo do they alſo their Altar and ſacrifices: for they are not content with the name of the Lords Table, which name was vſed both by the1. Cor. 10. 21. Arnob. cont. gen. lib. 6. Cyril. Alex. cont. Iulian, l. 10. Chryſ. in Pſa. 95. Apoſtles and primitiue Church. For which cauſe (as teſtifieth Arnobius, Cyrill, and Chryſoſtome) they were challenged by the Pagans of impiety, nor yet to take the name of Altar and Sacrifice in an improper ſignification, as ſome of the later Fathers did, calling the Lords Table an Altar, becauſe onAug. cont. Fauſt. lib. 20. ca. 18. & li. 3. de bapt. c. 19 it was repreſented the ſacrifice of the Croſſe, and the action in the Euchariſt a ſacrifice, becauſe it was a commemoratiue repreſentation of that ſacrifice, as their writings plentifully teſtifie; but they will haue a very Altar in proper phraſe of ſpeach, and a true reall ſacrifice, then which what can be more Iewiſh? eſpecially, ſeeing all ſuch Altars were aboliſhed by the Croſſe of Chriſt; and there remaineth but one Altar in the Church, Whereof they haue no power to eate which ſerue the Tabernacle,
                  
                     Rco. 13. 10. Theodoret. Oëcumen. Aquinas. Gloſſa ordin. in lacum. to wit, Chriſt, as all the Fathers expound the place, who is the onely true Altar and proper ſacrifice of the new Teſtament: True Altar (I ſay) and proper Sacrifice, becauſe the ſoule of euery iuſt man is called by them a metaphoricall Altar, and their prayers, good workes, almes-deeds, &c. ſpirituall ſacrifices. And therefore Clemens Alexandrinus, and Origen, and Lactantius, writing againſt the Pagans, who obiected that Chriſtians had no Altars nor ſacrifices, and therefore no religion, anſwere, That a iuſt and holy ſoule is a right holy Altar, from which doe ariſe prayers as ſweet incenſe, and vpon which are offered vp to God, iuſtice, patience, faith, innocencie, chaſtity, and ſuch other v
                        •
                     rtues. And theſe are the onely Altars and Sacrifices now vpon earth; for our true Altar and ſacrifice is in heauen.
               7. Againe, the Iewes had lampes continually burning in the Tabernacle, and afterward in the Temple, which were

types of Chriſt, who is the true light of the world, and of theIoh. 1. 9. Matth. 5. 14. Apoſtles and Miniſters of the Goſpell, who by their doctrine and preaching conuay this light from Chriſt the fountaine, as it were by Conduits and Pipes, to the illuminating of the whole world: Qui

Yet the Church of Rome retaine alſo this ceremonie: for they haue multitude of Lampes and Candles in their Churches burning in the day time, as if they would declare to the world, that either they beleeue that Chriſt is not yet come, or elſe that they haue not the cleare Sunne-ſhine of the Goſpell amongſt them, but the dimme Candle-light of ſuperſtition.

But our God dwelleth in light inacceſſible, and he is all light, and in him is no darkneſſe: what neede any light or Lamps be ſet vp before him then? If they ſay, that they haue the example of the primitiue Church for their warrant. I anſwere, that it is true indeede, as may appeare out of all Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtories, and the Epiſtles of Plinie the ſecond, to Traiane, that they had the vſe of Lamps in their aſſemblies: but this was in their night-meetings, which they were conſtrained to vſe in the time of perſecution, not daring to aſſemble together by day: as is teſtified both by Euſebius,

               8. So likewiſe they fetch the vſe of their hallowed water from the Iewes, if not from the Pagans, for the Iewes hadNumb. 10. their Holy-water made of the aſhes of a red Cow, whereby were purged all legall vncleanneſſes: ſo haue the Romaniſts their Holy-water ſprinkles, to purge and clenſe away all the impurities of the ſoule. This is plaine, not onely by their practice, but alſo by the decree falſly fathered vpon Pope Alexander the firſt: but indeede of ſome later Pope, whichDeconſecrat. D. 3. cap. aquam ſale. thus ſpeaketh: We bleſſe water mingled with ſalt, that all being ſprinkled therewith, may be ſanctified and purified, which wee enioyne all Prieſts to doe: for if the aſhes of a Cow being ſprinkled, did ſanctifie and clenſe the people of the Iewes, then much more doth water mixed with ſalt, and conſecrated by diuine prayers, ſanctifie and clenſe Chriſtian people. Which conſequence how vaine and impious it is, who ſeeth not? Vaine, I ſay, for the

Leuiticall Holy-water did onely clenſe from outward vncleanneſſes, but the Romiſh by their doctrine doth purge the ſoule from ſpirituall pollutions. Impious, for the Scripture ſaith, that it is the bloud of Christ that purgeth vs from all
                  1. Ioh. 1. 7. 
                  our ſinnes, and not water mingled with ſalt: and it maketh the compariſon not betwixt the aſhes of an Heyſer and Holywater,Heb. 9. 13. 14. water, but betwixt it and the bloud of Chriſt. This imitation then is both vaine and impious, if it bee of the Iewes: and more, if it be of the Gentiles: for what agreement hath the2. Cor. 6. 16. Iuſtin Martyr in Apolog. 1. Temple of God with Idols? And yet ſo it is alſo: for Iuſtine Martyr telleth vs, that the deuils, when they heard out of the Prophets of the ſpirituall waſhing that ſhould be in the Kingdome of Chriſt, in an apiſh reſemblance cauſed his worſhippers to purge themſelues by the ſprinkling of hallowed water. And Theodoret,

Thus it plainely appeareth, that this was a Heatheniſh cuſtome; which how it can agree with the Church of Chriſt, I know not; ſure I am, that in the Primitiue Church there was no holy-water beſides the water of Baptiſme, that can be proued by any good authority; for the teſtimonies of Alexander the

Iohn ſo lately before had left this doctrine, that the onely purgation of ſinne was the bloud of Chriſt; and not holy-water conſecrated by a Prieſt.
               9. In like manner, their vſe of Incenſe on their Altars to driue away deuils (as they ſay) doth ſauour both of Iudaiſme

and of Paganiſme. That the Iewes vſed to burne Incenſe inPolyd. Virgil, de Jnuent. li. 5. c. 1. Innocent. 3. de offic. Miſſ. lib. 2. cap. 17. Exod. 30. 1. Pſal. 141. 2.

This is ſo euident, not only out of holy Scripture, but frō the full conſent of all Writers old & new, that it is needles to ſtand to prooue it.

Virgil de Inuent. li. 5. c. 1. Theod. li. 3. c. 15. & 16. And Theodoret affirmeth, that when Iulian diſtributed gold amongſt his Souldiers, hee commanded an Altar full of coales to bee ſet by him, and Frankincenſe to bee layd on a Table, to the end that euery one would recieue gold at his hand, ſhould firſt caſt Frankincenſe vpon the Altar: and this hee did to diſtinguiſh the Pagan from the Chriſtian. By which it is euident (by the way) that at that time this was not in vſe in the Church. This Iewiſh and Paganiſh cuſtome then, how commeth it to paſſe, that it ſhould now bee taken vp as a holy ſeruice of God? Are not all Iewiſh Ceremonies at an end by the cōming of the body which is Chriſt? And is it fit that Chriſtians ſhould learne to worſhip God frō the Gentiles, which were worſhippers of deuils?

               10. Againe, the Iewes had their holy oyle wherewith their Kings, Prieſts, and Prophets were anoynted, which was a type and figure of that ſpirituall vnction of grace, wherewithPſal. 45. 7. Iohn 3. 34. 1. Ioh. 2 27. Chriſt our head was anoynted aboue his fellowes, and all his members in a due proportion. The Church of Rome hath alſo reuiued this Ceremonie, and that after a farre more ſuperſtitious manner: for there was not halfe ſuch a ſtirre at the making of the holy oyle of the Tabernacle, as there is at the conſecrating of their holy Chriſme: it would euen prouokeGallaſ. the ſpleene to laughter, and the gall to bitterneſſe, to heare or behold the apiſh trickes that they vſe at the making of their precious Chriſme: ſuch muttering, ſuch charming and enchanting, ſuch blowing and breathing, ſuch exorciſing and coniuring the deuill, by the mitted Biſhop firſt, and then twelue Prieſts in their order, before they come to Aue Sanctum Chriſma, All haile O holy Chriſme, as is wonderfull. What is this, I pray you, but a profeſt reſtoring of a Iewiſh Ceremony, and a plaine declaration that their Prieſts are rather Iewiſh than Chriſtian? and that thoſe graces of Gods ſpirit, which were figured by their holy oyle, are not to bee found in cheir Church, ſeeing they retaine ſo ſuperſtitiouſly the type thereof? If they ſay that Saint Iames mentioneth oyle to bee vſed at the viſitation of the ſicke, whereby they recouered health: I anſwer, firſt, that this was no ſuch conſecrated oyle as is in vſe in the Church of Rome: and ſecondly, that it was applyed onely to the ſicke that were in danger of death, not to young Infants that are new come into the world, at their baptiſme: thirdly, that it was not an inſtrument of ſpirituall grace, but of corporall health: and laſtly, that it laſted onely during the time that miracles liued in the Church, and dyed when they dyed: ſo that Saint Iames his oyle maketh nothing for the maintenance of the Romiſh Chriſme: and therefore I leaue it vnto them as a meere Iewiſh ſuperſtition.

Or as Aretine ieſted, one for the fleſh, another for the world, and the third for the deuill, and none for God. Aaron had a plate on his Crowne, wherin was engrauen Holineſſe

Aaron had his Ephod2.

               12. As touching their Fryers and Anchorites, how like are they to the Nazarites of the Law: the Nazarites might not drinke wine nor ſtrong drinke: no more may diuers of the religious ſhauelings by the rules of their order. They were tyed by a vowe which they might not breake without ſinne: ſo are theſe at their firſt entrance into their Cloyſters and Cels; and that ſo ſtrictly, that they account it a greater ſinne to violate that vow of voluntary Religion, then the vowe that they haue made to God in their baptiſme: and therefore they hold it a leſſe ſinne to commit fornication, which they haue vowed againſt in baptiſme; then to marrie, which they made vowe againſt when they tooke vpon them the religious order, as hath beene prooued in the former reaſon.

They might not meddle with worldly affaires, during the time of their ſeparation; no more may ſome of theſe Romiſh votaries, they may not ſo much as handle money (forſooth) with their bare hands; but with Gloues on, they will receiue as much as they can lay their clouches on: and euen whilſt they thus ſeeme to contemne riches, they ſpread their nets to draw whole Townes and Countries into their poſſeſſions. Onely in this the Nazarites and they differ: they were true worſhippers of God, and their order was Gods ordinance: theſe are monſtrous hypocrites, hidden vnder the cloke of Religion, neither are their orders of God, but as Chaucer long agoe ſung, The deuils excrements.
               
               13. Laſtly, for their Iubile ordained firſt by Boniface the eight, to bee euery hundreth yeere, after brought downe by Clement the ſixt to euery fifty yeere: and after that by to euery three and thirtith yeere; and laſtly, by to euery fiue & twentith yeere, where it reſteth. What is it but a renouation of that Iewiſh ceremonie, which was inſtituted by God, to ſignifie that euerlaſting happineſſe and ioy, which was brought into the world by Chriſt our Sauiour? The Trumpetters whereof were firſt the Prophets, as Eſay for example, who in the perſon ofEſay 61. 1. Chriſt proclaimed good tidings to the poore, healing to the broken hearted, liberty to the Captiues, and redemption to the Priſoners▪ the acceptable yeere of the Lord, &c. Secondly, the Angels who profeſſed, that they brought glad tidings of great ioy that ſhould bee to all people, at the birth of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt. And laſtly the Apoſtles, who when theyLuke 2. 10. 11. began to preach the Goſpell, proclaimed this great Iubile to all the world that ſhould beleeue in Chriſt, 
                     •
                  o continue not a yeere, but for euer and euer. To imitate this ceremony then, what is it, but with the Iewes to expect the Meſſias to come in the fleſh, and to diſclaime the glad tydings of the Goſpell, as a falſe meſſage, deceiuing the world? This is ſo Iewiſh a ſuperſtition, as the very name, time, and vſe, declare that nothing can be more.
               14. Thus wee ſee, how in the imitation of the Leuiticall

ceremonies, the Church of Rome goeth in equipage with the Synagogue of the Iewes: from whence may be deduced theſe two concluſions. Firſt, that the light of the Goſpell is either vtterly extinguiſhed, or at leaſt very dimly ſhining amongſt them: for it is a true rule, the more ſhadow, the leſſe light; and the more light, the leſſe ſhadow: and therefore thoſe Northerne people called by the Philoſophers Amphiſei
                        •
                     , becauſe their ſhadow goeth round about them in a circle, haue the Sunne ſo farre remote from them, that they are ſcarce refreſhed with the beames thereof: but they which haue the Sunne perpendicularly ouer them, are Aſcij, without ſhadow. And what is the night, but the darke ſhadow of the earth, and the day, but the remouing of that ſhadow by the comming of the Sunne? The Church of Rome then being thus enwrapped, and compaſſed about with the ſuperſtitious ſhadowes of Iewiſh ceremonies, plainly declareth, that either the Sunne is not riſen amongſt them, or that it is very farre off, euen in the skirts of their Horizon. Secondly, that their Church is not as they bragge of it, the onely Catholick Church, but rather the whore of Babilon, for her attire bewrayeth her condition: a chaſt Matrone is attired decently, but not gariſhly, but a ſtrumpet like Iezabel, ſets forth her ſelfe with gariſh deckings, and a painted face to allure louers vnto her: the Romiſh congregation then being thus adorned, not like a chaſt Matrone, but like a light Harlot, with the gariſh attire of Iewiſh ceremonies, all in pompe and oſtentation, diſcouereth her ſelfe not to be the Spouſe of Chriſt, but the ſtrumpet of Antichriſt. And ſo I conclude the firſt part of this argument, that ſeeing one piece of the Iewes enmitie to Chriſt, conſiſteth in retayning the Leuiticall ceremonies, which had their accompliſhment in Chriſt: therefore to imitate them in this reſpect, is a plaine demonſtration, that their Religion is not from Chriſt, but from Antichriſt, his profeſt enemie.
               15. The ſecond point wherein they imitate the Iewes, is farre worſe then the former: for it is in their Rabbiniſh and Cabaliſticall traditions, which as they are moſt groſſe corruptions of the law, ſo are they the fouleſt enemies to the Goſpell

of Ieſus Chriſt that the world hath. I will not ſtand to reckon vp the fooliſh & ridiculous niceties of the brainſick Rabbines, wherewith the ignorant Iewes are at this day beſotted, and which are as a veyle ouer their eyes, to hinder them from ſeeing the truth. I remit the Reader for theſe things to Buxdorfius,
                  Buxdorf▪ Synag. Iudaic▪ Paul. Fag. Sixt. Senenſ. Bibliot. lib. 2. Galat. de Arcanis. 
                  Paulus Fagius, Sixtus Senenſis, and Galatinus: my taske is to ſhew, how the Church of Rome imitateth them in many of theſe their abſurd fancies, which will proue their Religion to be little better then theirs.
               16 Firſt, the Iewes hold, that Moſes receiued two lawes of God in mount Sinai; the one written, and the other vnwritten: this latter they call their Cabala, and they ſay, that Moſes by word of mouth commended it to Ioſhua, and Ioſhua to the Elders of Iſrael, and they to the Prophets, and they againe vnto the Maſters of the great Synagogue vnder Eſdras, from whom their wiſemen called Cachamim ſucceſſiuely receiued it, and in this they glory, calling it the ioy of their hearts, and the refreſhing of their bones. This vnwritten Cabala, was at the firſt preſerued onely in the hearts of their great Cachamim or learned Maſters, and deliuered by them to the people by mouth onely: afterward it began by little and little to be commended to writing, and was at the firſt called Miſchua, that is, the law repeated, after the Thalmud of Ieruſalem: and laſtly, the Thalmud of Babylon, which is the moſt ſacred Scripture, by which the Iewes are gouerned and directed at this day, and which they preferre before the law written: for the law written (ſay they) can neither be vnderſtood, nor expounded without the helpe of this, neither is perfect, vnleſſe this bee added to it. Thus dote the Iewes vpon their Thalmud and Cabala.
               
               17. And doe not the Romaniſts dote as much about their vnwritten traditions? heare and iudge: firſt, with them theyConcil. Trident▪ Bellarm. de

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , written and vnwritten: their vnwritten word is nothing but orall Traditions, deliuered (as they ſay) by Chriſt himſelfe to his Apoſtles alone, and not to his common Diſciples, becauſe it contayned the high myſteries of the Kingdome of God, and

by them conuayed to their ſucceſſours, Biſhops and Elders of the Church. Secondly, they affirme alſo with them, that theſe orall Traditions are of equall authority and neceſſity with the word written, yea, that the word written is of no authority at all, quoadnos, in reſpect of vs, except it bee authorized by the tradition of the Church. And thirdly, they teach that the word written is imperfect, vnleſſe the vnwritten Cabala bee added vnto it, and that, not one alone, but both together make a perfect rule both for faith and manners. Doe they not now Iudaize in all theſe points? Yes, the Romiſh Apologers, to proue their doctrine of traditions, fetch an argument from the Iewes Cabala, as may bee ſeene in a late tractate, falſly called the Catholike Apologie: which is ſo much the more ſtrange, becauſe their own Sixtus Senenſis profeſſeth, that the Iewiſh Thalmud is fraught with innumerable
                  Sixt. Senenſ. Biblioth. lib. 2. 
                  blaſphemies againſt God and his Chriſt our Sauiour, and impieties againſt the law of Moſes, beſides other infinite fopperies. Is not this then a good patterne for them to imitate? and is it not a ſound argument that is deduced from ſuch premiſes? Surely their traditions which they build all their ſuperſtition vpon, thus ſymbolizing with the Iewiſh Cabala, can be of no better credit then it is: and what credit that hath, not onely their Senenſis before, b

Againe, the Iewes aſcribe ſo much credit and faith to their Cachamim or illumined Doctors, that whatſoeuer they teach, be it right or wrong, they muſt not enquire into the truth thereof, but receiue it as an article of their Creed, and build their faith and ſaluation thereupon. Thus writeth one of their owne Rabbines, to wit, Rabbi Iſaac, that died in Portugall,

them, then either of theſe. So, that hence it is moſt euident, that as the Iewes are bound to beleeue all that their Cachamim teach, and not to ſtand to examine what it is that they teach: ſo the Romaniſts are bound by their Religion to entertaine into their Creed, whatſoeuer is taught them by their ordinary Paſtours, without all enquirie and ſearch into their doctrines, whether they bee true or falſe. And as this is one chieſe cauſe of the Iewes obſtinacie againſt Chriſtian Religion: ſo is it alſo of that miſerable ſuperſtition which raigneth in the Church of Rome: for if the people were but perſwaded, that their learned Doctours might erre and deceiue, they would certainely ſuſpect their doctrines, and try them by the touchſtone of the holy Scriptures, and ſo at length might be reclaimed from their errours: thus they march together in this point alſo.

Brandspiegelium. at this day beareth witneſſe: for they vſe to ſay ouer the dead bodies a certaine prayer called Kaddiſh, by the vertue whereof (as they thinke) they are deliuered out of Purgatory; eſpecially if it bee ſaid by the ſonne for his father, and if hee

haue no ſonne, by the whole Congregation on their Sabboth dayes. And that this alſo is the doctrine and vſage of the Church of Rome, beſides their Bookes, their Maſſes for the quicke and the dead, their Diriges and Trentals doe ſufficiently teſtifie: And that they fetch this cuſtome from the Iewes, may appeare by two reaſons: firſt, becauſe one mayne argument of theirs, which they call a demonſtration to proue the lawfulneſſe hereof, is deriued from the example of the Iewes; as we may ſee both in Galatinus, Coccius, and our lateGalat. de ſecret. Cathol. fid. Coccius Theſaur. Cathol. fid. Apolog. Cathol. fid. Bredenbach. de diſſ. componend. Engliſh Apologiſts. And ſecondly, becauſe as it is confeſſed by their owne Bredenbachius, it is not found in all the writings of the Apoſtles and Euangeliſts in the new Teſtament, and we may adde hereunto, neither in the olde, vnleſſe by diſtorted and miſalledged texts, which are not worth the anſwering: except onely that fore-named paſſage of the Maccabees, which notwithſtanding is corrupted both by the Tranſlatour, and alſo the Relatour Iaſon Cyreneus, as is vnanſwerably proued by our famous Country-man, Doctour Reynolds:
                  Reynold. de Idololat. l. 1. c. 5. ſect. 8. & 9. the word (Dead) being cogged into the Text by ſome cunning Iuggler, which is not in the Originall, wherein lyeth the pith of the argument. And therefore it muſt needes follow, that the Romaniſts doe merely Iudaize herein. And for the Fathers which they alledge for the proofe of this article, let their owne Caſſander giue ſatisfaction: who affirmeth,Caſſand. conſult. art. 24. that the ancient Church vſed prayers for the dead, either as thankfull congratulations for their preſent ioyes, or eſſe as reſtimonies of their hope, and deſire of their future reſurrection, and conſummate bleſſednes both in their bodies and ſoules: and this hee proueth out of Cyprian, Augustine, Epiphanius, Chryſostome, and ancient Leiturgies.
               21. Againe, they Iudaize in their doctrines of Limbus Patrum, and Purgatorie: for Purgatorie▪ it hath beene alreadie touched in the former ſection, and for Limbus Patrum, it is

proued: and being alſo no part of Canonicall Scripture, doth plainely ſhew, that it is a mere Rabbiniſh conceit, hatched in their brainſick Thalmud, and not bred in holy writ. Yet our Romaniſts lay faſt hold on the ſame opinion, without any other certaine ground to build it vpon. For as touching the places of Scripture collected by them, to proue this aſſertion, they are either ſo impertinent or diſtorted, that the meaneſt iudgement may eaſily diſcry their weakneſſe: for either they are deriued from a word of an ambiguous ſignification, as

Therefore it muſt needes follow, that ſeeing this doctrine hath no ſure foundation in Gods word, but is founded vpon the Iewes prophane Thalmud, that it

is no better then a mere Rabbiniſh conceit.
               22. Againe, they ioyne hands with the Iewes in their doctrines of Free-will, inuocation of Angels and Saints, and merite of good workes: all which the moderne Rabbines hold as articles of their Creed, deriuing them from their predeceſſours the Phariſes that went before them.

And ſo alſo of Inuocation of Saints, ſome of them affirming that the pureFlau. Ioſeph de Bell. Iud. lib. 3. cap. 14. Rabb. Abraham in Gen. 22. Li. praecat. Iuda. ſoules which heare them that pray vnto them, haue a place in heauen. Others, that the Iewes vſed to interpoſe in their prayers betwixt them and God, Iſaac, as an interceſſour. Others, that prayers are to be made to Angels, to open the gates of Paradiſe, and to appeaſe Gods wrath. And laſtly, the RomaniſtsApol. Cathol. themſelues affirme, that when our Sauiour cryed out on the Croſſe, Eli, Eli, &c. the Iewes would neuer haue ſuppoſed that he had called for Elias, had it not been an vſuall practice amongſt them to call vpon the Saints departed. Laſtly, touchingBuxduorf. ſynag. Iudaic. the merite of worke, the Iewes teach, that God once euery yere, to wit, in the moneth of September, at what time he created the world, calleth all mens liues to an account for the yeare paſt, and openeth three Bookes, one wherein are written the names of notorious ſinners and Atheiſts, called The Booke of Death: another, in which are enrolled the names of iuſt and holy men, called The Booke of Life: and a third, for ſuch as are in a meane betwixt both, neither exceeding bad, nor exceeding good, but of a mixt diſpoſition, and theſe haue reſpite giuen them till the day of reconciliation to repent in, which is the tenth day of the ſame month; at which time if their good doth exceed their euill, then it goeth well with them; but if their euill exceed their good, then they are regiſtred preſently in the Booke of Death. And leſt GOD ſhould be deceiued, they ſay, that he holdes in his hand a ballance, into one skale whereof he puts their good workes, and into the other their euill deeds, that he may meaſure out his

rewards according to the weight of the one or the other. How ridiculous a fable is this? Much like vnto the Poeticall fiction of Min

By this it appeareth, that the fooliſh Rabbines maintained free-will, inuocated Saints and Angels, and eſteemed their workes meritorious: All which are the very opinions of the Church of Rome, beleeued and practiſed of all the profeſſours of that Religion: which is ſo much the more abſurd, becauſe they themſelues confeſſe in ſpeciall, concerning the doctrine of InuocationSuarez tom. 2. in 3. part. Thom. q. 52. art. 1. diſp. 42 of Saints, that it was not taught vnto the people of the olde Teſtament for feare of Idolatry, nor at the firſt preaching of the Goſpell, for feare it ſhould ſeeme vnto them a hard and harſh doctrine: and in generall, that it is madneſſe to relye our faith vpon the Iewiſh Thalmud, ſeeing the Thalmudicall Writers are full of impieties and blaſphemies, and thereforeSixt. Senenſ. biblioth. Sac. lib. 2. § tradit. haue not onely been prohibited to be read, but alſo condemned to the fire by diuers of their owne Popes: all which notwithſtanding, our Romiſh Rabbies fetch a demonſtration for the maintenance of theſe doctrines, from the example and practice of the Iewes.
               
               23. In like manner the Iewes had thoſe that profeſſed a monaſticall and ſingle life, which were called Eſſaeans, fromSigor. de repub. hebraic. l. 5. c. 11. the Greeke word 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   that is, Saints or holy men, as ſome ſuppoſe, becauſe (
                     •
                  orſooth) they tooke vpon them to be more holy then others; and therefore would not offer ſacrifice with the people, becauſe they thought them not ſo holy as themſelues. And theſe, as Ioſephus and Philo teſtifie, profeſſed continency from marriage, community in goods, and abſtinence from meats, not by any warrant out of Gods word, but onely by the authority of their vnwritten traditions. And doe not the Romaniſts imitate them in the ſame kind? What are their Monkiſh Votaries but Apes of the Iewiſh Eſſaeans? And what is their Monaſticall profeſſion▪ but a pretence of a ſtate of rare holineſſe and perfection? They

vow chaſtitie in ſingle life, and abhorre marriage as a ſtate of pollution: they abſtaine from meates, and profeſſe voluntary pouerty, with a community of goods: and all this they do, that they may ſeeme more holy then others, and merite heauen by their holineſſe, hauing withall anſwerable vnto them, nothing but tradition for their warrantize, without either ſound precept or true example out of holy Scripture. For, grant that their Euangelicall Councils are ſuch as they would haue them to be, and that vowes in Chriſtianity are lawfull: yet it is certaine that the authority of Councils, and the lawfulneſſe of vowes doe neither warrant nor allow their ſuperſtitious and idle monkery, nor the blaſphemous opinion ofBell. de Monac. lib. 2. cap. 6. merite, which they aſcribe vnto ſuch voluntary deuotions, nor yet the neceſſity of irreuocation, though by the frailty of mans nature there be an impoſſibility of performance. And ſo both in ſubſtance and circumſtance they want the authority of gods word to vphold them. Let then the Iewiſh Eſſaeans, and the Romiſh Monks, walke together, as in one path of ſuperſtition, ſo vnder one cloake of hypocriſie: for that which Sigonius affirmeth of the one, that they were by Nation,

               24. The Iewiſh Rabbines alſo taught, that the damned ſoules in hell and Purgatory had ſome refreſhing and reſt vpon euery Sabboth day, aſſoone as a certaine prayer was chanted out by them with ſweet melodie: and therefore, that on
                     
                        〈…〉
                     . 14. euery Friday at night there is a great ſhout in hell for ioy of the enſuing Sabboth, and on their Sabboth day at night a dolefull crye for griefe of their returne to their paines. Thus

the Rabbines doted: And do not our Romiſh Rabbines dote in like manner? They alſo teach, that the damned ſoules haue ſome refreſhment and eaſe vpon the Sabboth day: as in theLegend. Sancti Brandonis. legend of S. Brandon it is written, how that holy Abbotfound Iudas the Traytour ſitting vpon a ſtone in a certaine Iſland, and demanding of him what he was, and why heeſate in that place: he anſwered, that vpon euery Saturday at noone, vntill after Euenſong vpon Sunday, he was ſuffered to ſit there out of the helliſh torments, to be refreſhed and comforted during the Sabboth: Now if Iudas found this fauour, muſt wee not thinke that all other obtaine the like?
               25. The Iewiſh Rabbines deuiſe ſtrange tales of walkingo ghoſts, for the vpholding of the walls of Purgatorie, as that Rabbi Akiba ſhould meet once in the way, a man with a heauie burden of ſtickes on his backe, who vpon examinationBuxdorf ſynag. Judaic. confeſſed, that hee was a Purgatorie Ghoſt, carrying ſuch a bundle of ſtickes euery day to burne himſelfe: and that the Rabbi finding out his ſonne, taught him to ſay the prayer called Kaddiſch, which was ſo effectuall, that in a dreame this ghoſt returned to the Rabbi, with thanks for his deliuery, and ſaid, that hee was now in Gan Eden or Paradiſe, and no longer in Purgatory. This and ſuch like tales they tell for their Purgatorie: wherein the Romaniſts may behold their face as it were in a glaſſe: for are not their Bookes and Legends full ſtuft with ſuch traſh? is not this article of their Religion maintayned by this argument? are not the mindes of the vulgar poſſeſſed with ſuch fearefull fables? I will not ſtand to ſhew how full of falſhood theſe narrations are, nor how contrary to the ancient doctrine of the chiefeſt Fathers, and Primitiue Church; (that ſhall bee diſcouered in a more proper place) onely I ſhew how poore Purgatorie, both with Iewes and Romaniſts, is vpholden by walking ghoſts, or elſe it would fall to the ground.
               26. The Iewiſh Rabbines teach their people, to confeſſe one to another their ſins the day before their feaſt of reconciliation, which is the tenth day of the month Tiſri or September and that in a ſecret place of the Synagogue; where each

receiueth mutually at his fellowes hand with a lether belt 39. blowes, and at each blow the party beaten beates themſelues on the breſt, and ſaith one word of his confeſſion, taken out of the 78. Pſalme and 13. verſe: then the ſtriker lyeth down
                     •
                  , and receiueth like penance at the hands of the former: this done, they runne home, and make merry with the Cocks and Hennes of reconciliation, ſupping largely becauſe of the next dayes faſt. Now doe not our Romaniſts imitate them in this May▪game of confeſſion, and hypocriticall penance? They muſt alſo confeſſe their ſinnes in ſecret, and receiue a ſhort penance for their long ſinnes, and that once a yeere principally: with a certaine perſwaſion of meriting thereby remiſſion of their ſinnes, and when they haue done, doe they not returne, like the dogge to the vomit, to their old courſes? If a man ſhall obſerue them well, and compare their practices together, hee ſhall eaſily perceiue, how both of them alike turne that ſeuere diſcipline of the Church which they bragge ſo much of, into a mere mockage and paſtime.
               27. The Iewiſh Rabbines looke for Elias the great Prophet, to come before their long expected Meſſias. And doc not our Romiſh Rabbines tell vs that Elias muſt come before the ſecond comming of Chriſt? they are both alike in this erronious conceit, ſaue that the Romaniſts erre worſe then the Iewes, for that they will haue Elias to bee the fore-runner of Chriſts ſecond cōming, whereas the Iewes expect him, according to the prophecy of Malachy, together with our SauioursMalach 45. Matth. 11. 14. application thereof, before the firſt comming of their Meſſias.
               28. The Iewiſh Rabbines imagined, that euery one had attending vpon him two Angels, one good and another bad, the one to protect and bleſſe him, if hee behaued himſelfe deuoutly and reuerently in Gods ſcruice; the other to curſe and afflict him, if hee found him failing in his duty. Our Romiſh Rabbines teach the fame doctrine, as if all the Angels were not miniſtring ſpirits, for the good of them which are heires of ſaluation: and as if a man had but one cuill ſpirit to tempt and

               29. The Iewiſh Rabbines taught that thoſe ſhall be more ſeuerely puniſhed, who ſhould violate the precepts of their Scribes, then they that ſhould tranſgreſſe the law of Moſes: and doe not our Romiſh Rabbines affirme the ſame in effect, when they impoſe a greater puniſhment vpon the breach of one of their traditionall decrees, then if a man'breake the precepts of Gods law? as for example, if a man eate fleſh in Lent, or after a vow marrie a wife, then if hee commit adulterie or breake the Sabboth?
               30. The Iewiſh Rabbines perſwade the ſilly people, that they are the onely Elect people of God, who eaſily can keepe not the Decalogue or tenne Commandements alone, but the whole law of Moſes: and therefore that the law conſiſting of ſixe hundred and thirteene Commandements, wherof three hundred, threeſcore and fiue are prohibitions, as many as are dayes in a yeere or veynes in a mans body, and two hundred, forty and eight commanding precepts, iuſt ſo many as a man hath members in his body; if euery member of a man doe euery day performe one of the precepts, and omit one of the things prohibited, the whole law of Moſes may bee euery yeere, and ſo for euer fulfilled. Thus they vaunt of their owne ſtrength to ſaue themſelues, and therefore ſeeke not for a Sauiour without themſelues. And what doe our Romiſh Rabbines but the ſame, when they affirme, that a man may in this ſtate-of mortality, perfectly fulfill the whole law: yea, euen doe more then the law requireth, and ſo ſupererogate? what neede haue theſe of the death of Chriſt, to purge away their ſinnes, when they can thus by the ayde of Gods grace (as they ſay) keepe all the Commandements, and ſo pay the vttermoſt debt of their obedience? Let them goe together then as enemies vnto Chriſt in this opinion alſo.
               31. To conclude: the Iewiſh Phariſes faſted twice a weeke: ſo doe our Romiſh ones, ſaue that they alter the order, but not the number of the dayes: for the Iewes faſt the ſecond and fift day of the weeke: the Romaniſts the fourth and ſixt. The Iewiſh Phariſes vſed in a blinde deuotion, to

beate their heads againſt the walls, till bloud came, to vſe thornes in their skirts to ſting themſelues, to lye on plankes, on ſtones and thornes, to drench themſelues of

               32. The Iewiſh Phariſes would not conuerſe with any of a different Religion, eſpecially the Samaritanes, whoſeBuxdorf. Synop. Iudaic c. 11. bread they thought it as vnlawfull to eate, as to eate Swines fleſh: and for Chriſtians, they account it a ſinne to keepe faith and promiſe with them, to afford them any ſuccour: yea, not to doe them any miſchiefe that lyeth in their power: and therefore in their prayers one part of their deuotion is, moſt direfully to curſe all thoſe that profeſſe Chriſtian Religion. The Romiſh Phariſes doe likewiſe, they damme all to hell that are not of their Religion, they denie faith to bee kept with Heretikes, they hate all that are not ſubiect to their Pope, but aboue all, the poore Proteſtant: him they curſe with Bell, Booke and Candle, and abhorre him more then a Iew or a Turke: yea, once a yeere ordinarily and in publike, they curſe vs to the pit of hell, which I take it to be vpon euery good Friday. They ſay, that the Father may not nouriſh his owne childe, if he be an Heretike, nor the childe honour his Father, nor the Prince defend his Subiect, nor the Subiect obey his Prince: all bonds of nature, policy, religion, are pulled in pieces by theſe Romiſh Phariſes.
               33. The Iewiſh Phariſes vſed not to faſt without a diſfigured face, nor giue an almes without a Trumpet, nor ſeldome pray, but in the corners of the ſtreetes and high-wayes,

that they might bee ſeene of men, all for ſhew, nothing for ſubſtance. And are not our Romiſh Phariſes their equals in this? Is not their religion all in oſtentation? doe they hide themſelues when they faſt and pray? doe they not blow a trumpet before their deedes of charitie? their hypocriticall abſtinence from fleſh on ſet dayes, when as in the meane while they farſe themſelues with dainty fiſh and delicate iunkets; their mumbling vp ſo many Aue Maries, and Pater Noſters, in the ſtreetes and Market-places, their crow

                  hing at euery Croſſe; and laſtly, their Almes-deeds extorted by feare, either for penance of ſinnes committed, or in hope of meriting the kingdome of Heauen, and imployed for the moſt part to the feeding of a multitude of idle Drones, Monkes and Fryers, fatted in a Cloyſter, like Bores in a ſtye, doe proue this to be true which I haue ſaid.

The Iewiſh Phariſes vnder colour of long prayers & greatMat. 23. 14. deuotion, deuoured widowes houſes: the Romiſh Phariſes by the ſame pretext of holineſſe, ſucke downe into their panches not the Cottage of ſome poore widdow, but the rich and faire Patrimonies of ſeduced Gentlemen, Noblemen, and others: the Iewiſh Phariſes compaſſed ſea and land to gaineMat. 23. 15. a Proſelite to their profeſſion: our Romiſh Phariſes trauell all Countries, & labour by all poſſible means to winne ſoules to their religion, and to reconcile men to the obedience of the Biſhop of Rome; and when they haue wrought their purpoſe, as thoſe, ſo theſe make them two-fold more the children of hell, then they were before.
               35. Laſtly, the Iewiſh Phariſes like hypocrites made cleane the out-ſide of the cup and platter, but within were full of bribery and exceſſe; and therefore are compared by our Sauiour to whited Tombes, which appeare beautifull without, but within are full of all filthineſſe. So, our Romiſh Phariſes come to vs in ſheepes clothing, giuing a bright luſter of holineſſe, and auſterity in their externe behauiour; but inwardly are rauening Wolues, deuouring the flocke, and haue their hearts fraught with all manner of villany; as lying for aduantage, equiuocation, couetouſneſſe, ambition, vncleane luſts, and other

inordinate affections, as the ſecular Prieſts boldly obiect againſt the Loyolian Sect, and are taxed backe againe byQuodlibet per totum. them as guilty of the ſame crimes.
               36. This ſubiect might be enlarged by many more particulars,Concluſ. but that I forbeare to ſtirre this ſinke any further, and weary the Reader and my ſelfe, hauing a long iourney yet to trauaile. This that hath beene ſpoken, I ſuppoſe to be ſufficient, to prooue the truth of the propoſition, that the Romaniſts imitate the Iewes in thoſe things wherein they are enemies vnto Chriſt, both in reſpect of the legall Ceremonies, which are vaniſhed by the appearance of the Sunne of righteouſnes; and alſo in reſpect of their Thalmudieall traditions, which were neuer found in Gods Booke, but are the foppiſh dotages of their ſuperſtitious Rabbines. And is it not ſtrange, that notwithſtanding all this, they ſhould bragge themſelues to be the onely Catholikes of the world, and their Church the onely Noahs Arke, out of the which there is no ſaluation?

                  MOTIVE. IIII. That Religion which derogateth from the glory of God in the worke of our Redemption, and giueth part thereof vnto man, cannot be the truth of God: but ſuch is the Popiſh Religion: Ergo.
               THe firſt propoſition, as it is infallibly true of it ſelfe, ſoMAIOR. is it without all queſtion and controuerſie betwixt vs and the Romaniſts; for both confeſſe, that the end of true Religion is, that God might be glorified: and therefore whatſoeuer doth rebate from that end, cannot poſſibly be the truth: Eſpecially, ſeeing the Lord himſelfe proteſteth, that

                  he will not giue his glory to another, Eſay 48. 11. And Paul affirmeth, that the end of all our actions ſhould bee the glorie of God, 1. Car. 10. 31. Therefore paſſing ouer the Maior with ſilence, it is neceſſary that the Minor or ſecond propoſition bee ſtrengthened and confirmed, whereon the hinge of the Controuerſie hangeth, & the whole pith & ſubſtance of this fourth Argument doth conſiſt; which by the aſſiſtance of Gods good ſpirit (whoſe ayde I humbly implore, and of my Lord and Sauiour Chriſt Ieſus, whoſe glory I now labour to maintaine) I doubt not but to make ſo cleare, as is the Sunne at Noone-day, all cloudes, miſts, and fogges, being vtterly diſperſed.
               2. That the Romiſh Religion doth derogate from the gloryMINOR. of God in the worke of our redemption, may by foure maine and fundamentall doctrines of their Religion moſt euidently be demonſtrated, (beſides many other poynts of leſſer conſequence) to wit, their doctrines of Free-will, of Iuſtification, of merite, and of ſatisfaction.
               3. For the doctrine of Free-will, this is the generall determinationI. of the Church of Rome, that in the act of regeneration and conuerſion, mans will doth naturally cooperate with the grace of God, and that it is not meerely of ſupernaturall grace that a ſinner is regenerate, but partly of naturall free-will, and partly of grace: whereas, we on the contrary defend, that the regeneration and conuerſion of a ſinner is wholly of the grace of God, and that mans will in that great worke is meerely paſſiue, and not actiue, yea, ſtarke dead, vntill it be excited and quickned by the grace of God: This in briefe is the difference betwixt the Romaniſts and vs in this poynt. Now, here a double taske lyeth vpon mee; firſt, to proue this to bee their doctrine; and ſecondly, to ſhew how this doctrine tendeth to the empeachment of Gods glorie.
               4. That this is the doctrine of the Church of Rome, let the Councill of Trent, which they call their Church repreſentatiue, and which being approued by the Pope, cannot erre, as they affirme, be Iudge. Thus it decreeth, and bindeth the

decree with a curſe: Si quis dixerit, &c. (that is) If any man
                  Concil. Trident. Seſſ. 6. c. 6. can. 4. 
                  ſhall ſay, that mans free-wil being mooued and ſtirred by God, doth nothing cooperate by aſſenting to God, moouing and calling it, whereby it may diſpoſe and prepare it ſelfe to the obtaining of the grace of iuſtification, and that it cannot diſſent if it will: but like a thing without life, is not at all actiue, but meerely paſſiue, Anathema ſit. Let him be accurſed. This Riddle of the Councill of Trent (for ſo moſt of the decrees thereof are rather to bee termed, then Canons of faith) is thus expounded by Andradius
                  Andrad. Orthod. explicat. interpretation, who was preſent at the ſame Councill, and knew the meaning of thoſe holy Fathers; to wit, that there is in euery man by nature a power and ability, Ad inchoandas & perficiendas ſpirituales actiones, (that is) To beginne and to effect ſpirituall actions; but that power and ability is ſo fettered with the chaines of ſinne, that vnleſſe grace come and helpe to ſet it free, it can doe nothing: as a man weighed downe with yron ſhooes, though he hath power in himſelfe to go, yet cannot, except his yron ſhooes be put off: or as a bird caught in a ſnare, hath power to flie, yet cannot, except the ſnare be broken, &c. By theſe two ſimilitudes, he illuſtrateth the ſentence and meaning of the Councill: whereby it euidently appeareth, that this is the plaine doctrine of the Church of Rome, that of the regeneration and conuerſion of a ſinner, the ſpirit of God is not the ſole cauſe, but that with the ſpirit Mans free-will doth concurre, and ſo both together make the ioynt efficient cauſe.
               5. The later Romaniſts, and eſpecially the Ieſuites (to paſſe ouer the groſſe poſitions of the former Schoolemen) do more plainely deliuer the meaning of their Church concerning this poynt. Let vs heare Bellarmine ſpeake: Cooperamur
                  Bel. li. 6. de grat. & li. arb. ca. 11. 
                  Deo, &c. We cooperate with God (ſaith he) not onely as our Aduerſaries would haue after iuſtification, but euen in very iuſtification it ſelfe, and in the beginning of faith. And after he peremptorily concludeth; Non niſi cooperantibus nobis Deus ſalutem noſtrum operatur
                        •
                     , (that is) God doth not worke our ſaluation without our owne helpe, cooperating with him. We are beholding to Bellar. for ſetting down plainly our opinion. For this we hold, that after the firſt grace, wherin we are meerely

paſſiue, we then begin to will and worke our owne ſaluation; but yet not of our ſelues, as from our ſelues, but onely of his grace, wherewith as we are preuented to beginne, ſo we muſt continually be accompanied that wee may perſeuere: for if God withdrraw his grace neuer ſo little, we are 
                     •
                  ure to ſinke, as Peter did in the water: which is the very opinion of Saint Auguſtine, for in his Enchiridion ad Laurentium thus hee ſaith, Deus nolentempraenenit vt velit, volentem ſequitur, ne
                  Aug. Ench. ca. 32 
                  fruſtravelit; (that is) God preuenteth a man being vnwilling, that he may will; and followeth him being willing, leſt he ſhould will in vaine. And of Saint Hierome, who thus ſpeaketh Non
                  Hier. ad C
                        •
                     eſephont. 
                  ſufficit mihi quod ſemel donauit, niſi ſemper donauerit, peto vt accipiam, & cum accepero, rurſus peto, (that is) It is not ſufficient for me that he hath giuen me (grace) once, vnleſſe he doe alwaies giue; I pray that I may receiue, and when I haue receiued, I pray againe. And againe of Saint Auguſtine, Hominis non libera,
                  Aug. cont. 2. epiſt. Pelag. lib. 3. ca. 7 
                  ſed Dei gratia liberata voluntas, (that is) Mans will is not free, but freed by the grace of God. And in another place, Eatenus libera, quantenus liberata, (that is) It is ſo farre-forth free, as it is freed, and no further.
               
               6. But to proceed, Coſter another Ieſuite, is a little moreCoſt. Ench. de lib. Arbit. page 208. plaine and groſſe, Liberum arbitrium, &c. Free-will (ſaith he) doth prepare it ſelfe to iuſtification, by the ayde of God, not yet inhabiting, but onely moouing and helping, not onely ſuffering, but alſo working and doing. And againe in the ſame place, Man being fallen into the darke pit of ſinne, that he may be drawne out againe, doth not onely receiue and ſuffer, but coworketh with the grace of God, and prepareth himſelfe by beleeuing, truſting, and vndertaking the duties of piety, vntill ariſing vp to the Sonne of Righteouſnes, he be repleniſhed with the diuine light of grace; as Ieremie, being baled out of the dungeon, helped thoſe which pulled him out, by putting the cloutes and cordes vnder his armeholes. Salmeron, another Ieſuite, is yet more palpable, Liberum
                  Salmer. tom. 3. page 38. 
                  arbitrium non partem &c. Free will (ſaith hee) doth not worke one part, and the grace of God another; but to euery action is extended aſwell free-will as grace. But Ecchius ſurpaſſeth all theEcchius Enchir. reſt for plaineneſſe, for thus he writeth, The beginning of our
                  
                  ſaluation we haue from Gods mercy, but to yeeld to Gods wholeſome inspiration is in our power, &c. Thus with an impudent forehead, they marry together Gods grace and mans will in the act of Regeneration, betwixt which, a diuorce was made by the fall of Adam, and ſo remaineth irreconciled, till we be engrafted into the ſecond Adam by faith.
               7. Hence it is, that the Councill of Trent is bold to affirme,
                     Concil. Trident. Seſſ. 6. c. 4. that when equall grace is offered vnto two, that one is conuerted, and the other remaineth in his infidelity: the cauſe is in their wills, in that one entertaineth, the other reiecteth the grace that is offered: And to hold this (ſaith Molyn
                     •
                   another Ieſuite)Molyn. diſput. 12 
                  is a matter of faith. And this is the doctrine of Thomas their great Clerke. It is in the power of our free-will (ſaith he) to hinder
                  
                     Aquin. cont. Gent. lib. 3. c. 159. Ruard. art. 7. Pro. 10. explicat. art. Louan.
                   
                  or not to hinder the receiuing of diuine grace. And another more fully and foully thus dareth to ſpeake. If it be demanded why this man is conuerted and that man is not, the helpe of God being giuen alike to both, the reaſon is to be aſſigned to free-will, namely becauſe the one would bee conuerted, and the other would not: And this alſo Bellarmine himſelfe acknowledgeth. Gods motion
                  Bel. de quot▪ et lib. arbit. lib. 6. cap. 15. (ſaith he) leaueth man altogether free to be conuerted, or not to be. Laſtly, they doe not onely hold, that we haue a power in our wills, to moue towards our owne conuerſion, and freely to will or nill the accepting of Gods grace offered, but alſo to perſeuere to the end after grace receiued. This the IeſuiteMolyn. diſput. de lib. arbit. 
                  Molyna doth in expreſſe words ſet downe, when hee ſaith, That the perſeuerance of men in good, dependeth vpon their owne free cooperation, and the dayly particular diuine helpe. And this is the common receiued doctrine of the Church of Rome.
               
               8. Now out of all theſe their opinions, three materiall obſeruations doe ariſe: firſt, that that Helena of theirs, the merit of congruity, though in word it be reiected by ſome of the finer Ieſuites, yet in ſubſtance and in truth is ſtill retayned: for, whereas the Schoolemen ſay groſly, that a man by doing what he is able by the power of his nature, doth of congruity merit effectuall grace, the Councill of Trent and the later Diuines chooſe rather to ſay, that hee doth diſpoſe and prepare himſelfe to grace, which indeede is in effect all one: for, to

merit grace: and to diſpoſe a mans ſelfe to grace, is in diuerſity of words, but one and the ſame ſenſe: and this Bellarmine ingenuouſly
                     Bel. de Iuſtif. lib. 5. cap. 22. confeſſeth, when he ſaith, that a man not yet reconciled, may by the workes of penance obtaine and deſerue, ex congruo, of congruity, the grace of iustification. Thus they ſay and vnſay what they liſt, and gaineſay each other, and indeede are in ſuch a labyrinth, that they know not what to ſay: Secondly, that howſoeuer they magnifie the grace of God in word, and affirme nothing more frequently, then that without Gods grace, preuenting, aſſiſting and following vs, we can doe nothing, yet in very deede they aſcribe well-neere as much power to free-will, as to the grace of God: yea more, for they make the efficacie of the firſt grace, to depend vpon the free conſent of our will, and make it as it were the Porter to let in, or ſhut out grace at it pleaſure: which is one of the moſt preſumptuous conceits, that euer was vttered by the mouth of man, and full of blaſphemy. Thirdly and laſtly, that this firſt grace which they ſay, doth work with free-will, in the firſt act of our new birth, and help & aſſiſt it, is not intrinſicall and inhabitant, but barely outward & prouocant. In reſpect whereof, Coster compareth grace to a ſtaffe in a mans hand, which at his owne will he either vſeth for his helpe, or throweth away; and to a friend, who finding a man in a deepe pit, perſwadeth him by diuers reaſons to be willing to be pulled out. And in expreſſe words the ſame Ieſuite ſaith, that this grace is onely the impulſion and motion of the holy Ghoſt, being yet without, and ſtanding knocking at the doore of our heart, not being as yet let in. And Bellarmine auoucheth the ſame, when hee ſaith, that it is but onely a perſwading, which doth not determine the will, but inclineth it in manner of a propounding obiect. And thus vnder colour of the name of grace, they inſinuate into mens ſoules the poyſon of their doctrine, attributing in word all to grace, when indeede they meane nothing leſſe.
               9. Theſe things being thus diſcouered, let vs now come to ſee, how by this doctrine the glory of God is defaced: which that it may more clearely appeare, two grounds are to be laid:Eſay 48. 11. & 42. 8. the firſt whereof is, that God is ſo iealous of his glory, that he

cannot endure any copartner or ſharer with him therein. The ſecond is, that in caſes where grace & nature ſeeme to worke together, the godlieſt courſe is to magnifie the grace of God,1. Cor. 4. 7. and to debaſe the nature of man, yea, to aſcribe all to grace, and nothing to nature, becauſe this ſauours of humility, whereas the contrary hath a manifeſt taſte of pride. Theſe grounds being ſetled in our mindes, let vs come to the examination of their doctrine. And I pray you, touching the firſt ground, doth not this doctrine of theirs make man to part ſtakes with God? In his glory, whereas our doctrine doth aſcribe all the glory in ſolid, and whole to God onely: let any man iudge whether aſcribe more glory vnto God, wee, that affirme that God is all in all to the effecting of our regeneration, or they that ſay, that our will doth cooperate with his grace, or elſe it can doe nothing: we that ſay, that we are ſtarke dead to Godward, till God put life into vs by his ſpirit; or they that ſay, wee are but ſicke and halfe dead, and are but onely helped and aſſiſted by his ſpirit: wee that teach, that a man can no more prepare himſelfe to his owne iuſtification, then a dead man to life, or they that teach; wee may by our naturall powers either merit of congruity, or prepare our ſelues to our iuſtification. Laſtly, wee that aſcribe the whole worke of our ſaluation to God onely, or they that attribute ſome part thereof to their owne free-will. If this bee not to derogate from Gods glory, what can be? for apparently they ſhare the great and glorious worke of our regeneration betwixt God and man, grace and nature.
               10. Would it not (thinke you) be a great impeachment to Gods glory, if in the worke of our creation any ſhould teach that God alone did not create vs, but that we our ſelues were coadiutors with him: ſo in the worke of regeneration▪ which is a ſecond creation to attribute part to Gods ſpirit, and part to free-will, is it not a great blemiſh to the glory of God? for, either it muſt be ſaid, that God could not doe it of himſelfe alone, or that he would not: If the firſt, then they blaſpheme in derogating from his power: if the ſecond, then they dote in ſaying, God is not willing to maintaine his owne glory,

or that he is willing to impart it vnto others, contrary to his owne word and will reuealed in the Scripture, which way ſo euer they turne themſelues, they fall into the pit of impiety▪ and make themſelues guilty of high treaſon againſt the diuine Maieſtie.
               11. Againe, when our Sauiour raiſed vp Lazarus from the graue, where he lay ſtinking foure dayes, if it bee true which ſome write, that Lazarus life was ſtil remaining in him, and that his ſoule and body was not parted, and ſo our bleſſed Sauiour did but excite and ſtirre vp that life, which was as it were aſleepe, and did not inſpire into him a new life, and couple together his ſoule and body againe being deuided, is not the glory of this miracle mightily darkened and extenuated? This is our very caſe, wee ſay that a man is ſtarke dead and buried in the graue of ſinne, and till a new life of grace be inſpired into his ſoule, he cannot moue the leaſt haires bredth to heauen-ward▪ our aduerſaries ſay, that he is not dead, but maymed and wounded like the man, that betwixt Iericho and Ieruſalem fell among theeues; and therefore needes not to be reuiued, but onely to be healed and helped with the oyle and wine of grace powred into his wounds, he himſelfe cooperating with his owne free will: who ſeeth not that by this doctrine of ours, God is more glorified, and by theirs more debaſed? for the leſſe and eaſier the worke is, the leſſe is alſo the glory of the worke-man, and the greater and harder the worke, the greater his glory: but it is a leſſe worke to heale a man wounded, then to raiſe a man dead, and therefore leſſe glory aſcendeth vnto God by their doctrine, then by ours. But what doe I ſay leſſe? when indeed to giue any part of the Creators glory to the creature, is vtterly to take all from the Creator: for hee will haue all or none, as Tertullian notablyTertul. aduerſ. haereſ. obſerueth, when he ſaith, That true faith requireth this in defending the true God, that whatſoeuer is his, we make it onely his, for ſo ſhall it bee accounted his, if it bee accounted onely his, by which rule, the faith of the Romane Church cannot bee the true faith.
               12. And againe, according to the ſecond ground, if to

giue all the glory to God, and none to our ſelues, ſauour of humility, but to deuide ſtakes betwixt God and our ſelues, hath a taſte of pride: then it muſt needs follow, that God is more honoured by the one then by the other, becauſe by humility God is honoured, and by pride diſhonoured: and therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, that hee reſisteth the proud, and giueth
                  1. Pet. 5. 5. 
                  grace to the humble: for what cauſe? but becauſe the proud man ſeeketh his owne glory, whereas the humble deueſteth himſelfe of all, and layeth it downe at the foote of God: the proud man reioyceth in himſelfe, but the humble reioyceth in the Lord alone, according as it is written, Let
                  1. Cor. 1. 31. Ier. 9. 24. 
                  him that reioyceth, reioyce in the Lord. Now the Romaniſts that magnifie free-will, haue iuſt cauſe (their doctrine being preſuppoſed to be true) to reioyce in themſelues, which is an argument of pride: for, whereas our Sauiour ſaith, Without me
                  Ioh. 15. 5. 
                  ye can doe nothing, they may ſay, Yes ſomething, for wee can either admit or reiect thy grace by our owne power: and whereas the Apoſtle ſaith, Who hath ſeparated thee, what haſt
                  1. Cor. 4. 7. 
                  thou which thou haſt not receiued? they may ſay, I haue ſeparated my ſelfe in doing that which I was able, and ſo made my ſelfe fit for grace, and this power I haue not receiued from Gods ſpeciall fauour, but from my owne free will. All which kinde of ſpeeches, as they are full of pride and fleſhly vanity, ſo they are ſtuffed with impiety and blaſphemie, and manifeſtly tend to the diſpoyling of the diuine Maieſtie of that glory, which is onely due vnto him. And therefore I conclude with two notable ſayings, one of S. Augustines, and another of Caſſander, a learned Reconciliater of late time; Tutiores viuimus (ſaith the Father) ſi totum Deo damus, &c.
                  Auguſt. de bono Perſeuer. c. 6. that is, We liue more ſafely if we attribute all wholy to God, and not commit our ſelues partly to God, and partly to our ſelues. And this is the part of a godly minded man (ſaith the Reconciliater) to attribute nothing to themſelues, but all to Gods grace: whence
                  Caſſand. conſult. de lib. arbitr. 
                  it followeth, that how much ſo euer a man giueth to grace▪ yet in ſo doing, hee departeth not from pietie, though hee detract ſomething from nature and freewill: but when any thing is taken from Gods grace, and giuen to nature, which belongeth to grace, that
                  
                  cannot be without eminent danger. So that by the confeſſion both of this learned Romaniſt, and alſo of that reuerend Father, our doctrine in the poynt of free-will, is both more agreeable to piety, and reſpectiue to Gods glory, then theirs is; and therefore in reaſon to be preferred before it.
               13. The next doctrine whereby the glorie of God is darkened,2. and the dignitie of Chriſts merites blemiſhed, is their doctrine of Iuſtificatiō, which I ioyne next vnto Free-wil, becauſe their ſophiſtry & cunning in this great & maine pillar of Religion cannot well be diſcerned (they ſo palliate the matter with faire gloſſes & goodly words▪) except their opinion touching the power of Free-will be firſt apprehended. And here, before I enter into the bowels of this poynt, it is to be obſerued, that moſt of them vaunt and bragge that they doe much more magnifie Chriſts merites by their doctrine of Iuſtification, then we doe: which, how true it is, the diſcourſe following (I hope) ſhall ſo manifeſt, that euery indifferent man ſhall be able to ſay truely of them, as Saint Auguſtine ſaid of the Donatiſts, Theſe are the words of men, extolling the glory

                  of man, vnder the name of Chriſt, to the abaſing of the glory of Chriſt himſelfe.
               
               14. The doctrine therfore of our Church touching the iuſtification of a ſinner, is in effect thus much. That a ſinner is iuſtified that is accepted into the fauour and loue of God, not by any thing in himſelfe, or from himſelfe, but by the perfect and vnſpotted righteouſnes of Chriſt Ieſus, imputed vnto him by the meere mercy of God, through the couenant of grace, and apprehended on his behalfe by the hand of faith. The reaſon whereof is, becauſe that which muſt ſatisfie Gods iuſtice, and reconcile a ſinner vnto him, muſt haue theſe two properties; firſt, it muſt be of infinite weight and value, to counterpoyſe with the rigour of Gods iuſtice: and ſecondly, it muſt be of ſufficient ability to performefull and perfect obedience to the law of God; ſo that a perfect ſatisfaction bee made both in reſpect of the obedience which the law requireth, and alſo of the puniſhment that it inflicteth. Now, no righteouſneſſe of man is thus qualified, but is both imperfect and vnſufficient;

no, not the righteouſnes of Angels themſelues, being, though excellent, yet 
                     ••
                  finite Creatures, ſauing the righteouſnes of Chriſt Ieſus onely, who is both God and Man; and therefore his righteouſnes onely, and none other, is that whereby a ſinner muſt be iuſtified before God.
               15. From this it appeareth, that when we ſay that a man is iuſtified by faith, our meaning is not, that faith is the cauſe of our iuſtification, but onely the inſtrument and hand to apprehend that righteouſnes of Chriſt whereby we are iuſtified: & when we ſay, faith alone iust fieth; we meane that it alone is the inſtrument of our iuſtification, becauſe it alone layeth hold vpon the righteouſnes of Chriſt, and applyeth it to our ſelues: not that it is euer alone, but alwaies accompanyed with charity and patience, and zeale, and temperance, and other fruites of the ſpirit: for we hold, that the true iuſtifying faith is euer m

And as Bellarmine truely diſtinguiſhethBell▪ Ibid. to be neceſſary, Neceſſitate praeſentiae, non efficientiae, by a neceſſity of preſence, not of efficacie, as if they wrought our ſaluation. In a word, In the act of iuſtification, wee ſay that workes haue no roome, becauſe both they are imperfect, and alſo are not done by our own ſtrength; but being once iuſtified, we muſt needs repent, and become new creatures, walking not according to the fleſh, but according to the Spirit. And this is the doctrine of our Church concerning Iuſtification.
               16. Now let vs heare what they ſay, and then weigh both doctrines in the ballance of the ſanctuary, that wee

may ſee which of them bringeth moſt glory to the merits of CHRIST, and to the power of his ſatisfaction. I will plainely and ſincerely (God willing) ſet downe the ſumme of their doctrine. Firſt therefore they teach, that there is a double iuſtification, the firſt whereby a man ex iniuſto

He thatReuel. 22. 11. is iuſt, let him be more iuſt. Concerning the firſt iuſtification, ſome of them affirme, that it is the free gift of God, and deſerued by no precedent workes; others that it is merited by congruity, but not by condignity: but of the ſecond, they
                     Cenſ. Colonienſ. pag. 140. 141. Becan. Ibid.
                   ſay, that it is gotten and merited by our workes. But before both theſe, they make certaine preparations and diſpoſitions, whereby a man by the power of his owne free-will ſtirred vp

Whereupon they are bold to affirme, that the act of Iuſtification doth emane and proceed, Simul
                  Molina. diſput. 
                  ab arbitrio & à Deo, Both from free-will, and from God. Now the cauſes of iuſtification, the Councill of Trent maketh to be theſe; the finall cauſe, Gods glory, and mans ſaluation; the efficient, Gods mercy; the meritorious cauſe, Chriſts merits; the inſtrumentall, the Sacrament of Baptiſme; but the formall cauſe, which is the chiefeſt and 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , Dat eſſe rei, giueth being to the thing, as the Logicians ſpeake, they make to be an inherent righteouſnes wrought in vs, and inſpired into vs by the Spirit of God. And this in briefe is the doctrine of the Church of Rome, touching the iuſtification of a ſinner.
               17. Wherein let vs obſerue three maine and fundamentall differences, betwixt their doctrine and ours; in all which they raze the foundation, and dedignifie the merits of Chriſt, and

the mercy of God, to extoll the dignitie of man. The firſt in their preparations, wee hold that a man cannot any wayes diſpoſe himſelfe vnto grace, but is wholly fitted and prepared by God; and that thoſe acts of preparation (as they call them) are not fore-runners of iuſtification, but rather fruites and effects thereof, they teach the contrary, as I haue ſhewed. The ſecond difference is, that the workes of a man iuſtified do not merit increaſe of grace, which they terme the ſecond iuſtification: but as the beginning of grace is from gods mercy alone, ſo the increaſe and augmentation thereof and perſeuerance therein, is onely to be aſcribed to the worke of Gods ſpirit, according to that of Saint Paul, Phil. 1. 6. He that hath begunne
                  Phil. 1. 6. 
                  this good worke in you, will performe it vntill the day of Ieſus Chriſt: this we hold, they the contrary. The third difference is in the formall cauſe of our iuſtification, which they maintaine to be an inherent righteouſnes within vs, euen the righteouſnes of Sanctification. We on the other ſide affirme, that the formall cauſe of our iuſtification, is the righteouſnes of Chriſt Ieſus, not dwelling in vs, nor proceeding from vs, but imputed vnto vs by the mercy of God.
               18. Hauing thus layd open both our doctrines, let vs examine and trye which of them giueth moſt glory vnto God, and moſt exalts the merites of Chriſt, for that muſt needs be the truth; and which lifteth vp higheſt the proud nature of man, for that muſt needs be falſhood and errour: eſpecially, ſeeing that Gods dignity, and the dignity of man; Chriſts merits and mans, are as it were, two skales of a ballance, wh
                     •
                  reof the one riſing, the other falls, the one lifted vp, the other is preſſed downe. Firſt therefore, touching the workes of preparation, whether doe they more magnifie Gods mercie, that ſay a man cannot prepare and diſpoſe himſelfe at all to grace, but is wholly diſpoſed and prepared by God; or they that affirme that a man can prepare himſelfe by his owne endeuour, aſſiſted outwardly with the grace of God? the one makes Gods mercy the ſole cauſe of iuſtification, the other but the adi
                     •
                  vant and helping cauſe. And whether doe they aduance moſt the dignity of man, that ſay, that a man can do

nothing of himſelfe for his owne iuſtification, or they that ſay that a man can doe ſomething to the preparation of himſelfe to that great worke; the one attributeth ſome dignity to man, the other, none at all; we affirme the one part, the Romaniſts the contrary: and therefore our doctrine tends more to the debaſing of mans worth, and conſequently to the exalting of Gods glory, then theirs doth.
               19. True it is, like Ferrimen, that looke Eaſt and go Weſt, they with their great Grand-father Pelagius, talke of grace, when they meane nothing but nature, and ſo deny indeede that which they affirme in word, if the matter bee examined according to truth. For Pelagius confeſſed a neceſſity of grace
                     Aug. cont. Pelag. & Celeſt. lib. 1. cap. 31. 33. in all ſpirituall actions, and yet was condemned for an enemy to grace, by the Church of God, becauſe hee vnderſtood not by grace the ſanctifying worke of Gods ſpirit, but an outward moouing and perſwading power, aſſiſting mans free-will to the effecting of his owne ſaluation. The very ſame is the doctrine of the Romaniſts, as hath beene declared, and therefore wee may iuſtly condemne them as enemies to the grace of God, whatſoeuer they bragge and vaunt to the contrary.
               20. Secondly, touching the ſecond iuſtification, which ſtandeth, as they ſay, in the augmentation and encreaſe of our iuſtice: let the moſt partiall Reader iudge, whether tends moſt to the magnifying of Gods glory, their doctrine which teacheth that wee merite the encreaſe of our iuſtice by our owne workes: or ours, which teacheth, that both the ſeed and the growth, both the roote and the fruite, both the beginning and encreaſe of all righteouſneſſe, is the worke of Gods ſpirit alone, preuenting, aſſiſting, and vpholding vs to the end; and that theſe ſeuerall workes of grace are beſtowed vpon vs, not for any merites of our owne, but ſimply and entirely for the merits of Chriſt Ieſus. I, but they will ſay, works doe not merit iuſtification, becauſe they are ours, but becauſe they are works of grace, which grace floweth from the fountaine of Chriſts merits, and ſo they attribute aſmuch, or more, to grace and Chriſts merites, then wee doe. To which I anſwere, two things: firſt, if they held that theſe workes

were merely from grace, they ſaid ſomething to the purpoſe, but affirming as they doe, that they are partly from grace, and partly from the power of free-will, as two ioynt cauſes, this their ſomething is nothing, but a vizard to couer the vgly face of their errour. Secondly, let this be granted, that their doctrine is, that they proceede onely from grace, neuertheleſſe being wrought in man, and acted by man, they muſt needes bee called, and be indeede in part mans workes, becauſe man doth cooperate with grace; and therefore to make them meritorious abſolutely of grace, muſt needes tend in part to the exalting of mans dignitie, and conſequently in part to the impeachment of Gods. For, let an anſwere bee giuen to this queſtion, by what meanes doth a man continue in iuſtice, and encreaſe in holineſſe: Wee anſwere with Saint Paul, By the grace of God onely, who as hee hath begun that
                  Phil. 1. 6. 
                  good worke in vs, ſo will performe it vntill the day of Ieſus Chriſt: but the Romaniſts will anſwere, that this is done by the merit of our owne workes: which workes howſoeuer they mayBecan. diſput. pag. 195. colour the matter, by ſaying, they are works of grace, and receiue power frō Chriſts merits, yet being the works of man alſo, by the power of his free-will, who ſeeth not, but that Gods glory is greatly blemiſhed hereby, and mans worth extolled?
               21. Thirdly, touching the forme of iuſtification, which of vs doth moſt honour to God? they which teach that it is an inherent righteouſneſſe habituated in vs, or wee that ſay, that it is Chriſts righteouſneſſe imputed vnto vs? wee attribute all vnto Chriſt, and nothing to our ſelues: they ſhare the matter betwixt Chriſt and our ſelues: for this inherent righteouſneſſe, though it proceede from Gods ſpirit, as they ſay, and is a worke of grace, yet in three reſpects it may bee called our righteouſneſſe by their doctrine: firſt, in reſpect of the roote and ſpring of it, which is, as they affirme, partly grace and partly nature. Secondly, in reſpect of the ſubiect, which is the ſoule of man, which may bee alſo called the inſtrument by which it is effected; and that not a dead ſubiect or liueleſſe inſtrument, as we ſay mans nature is, till it be liued and quickned by Gods ſpirit, but of it ſelfe liuing and quicke,

and fit for ſo great a worke. Thirdly, In reſpect of the medium or meane, by which it is attained, which they hold is the merit of our owne workes, as I haue ſufficiently diſcouered out of their owne bookes. Now then, if this inherent righteouſneſſe bee in part our owne, and not wholy Chriſts, but the righteouſneſſe imputed be wholy and entirely Chriſts, and not in any reſpect ours, ſaue that it is giuen vnto vs, and made ours by imputation; who can doubt but that this our doctrine is farre more auaileable for the aduancement of Chriſts glory, and debaſing of mans excellencie, then theirs is? Adde herevnto, that it muſt needes be a diſhonour to God, to ſay, that an vnperfect, a polluted and a ſtayned righteouſneſſe, ſuch as the beſt of ours is, can ſatisfie the abſolute and moſt exact iuſtice of God: but it is an extolling glory to Gods iuſtice, to ſay that it cannot be anſwered, but by the moſt perfect and abſolute righteouſneſſe that euer was in the world; ſuch as the righteouſneſſe of the Sonne of God is, who taking our fleſh vpon him, performed in the ſame, all righteouſneſſe, that the ſtricteſt iuſtice of God required, for our ſakes.

                  ion vpon our doctrine, that wee ſhould hold Chriſts merits to be ſo meane, as to ſerue onely to couer and hide ſinne; whereas wee expreſly teach, and that with one conſent, that for the merits of Chriſt, not onely our ſinnes are pardoned, but alſo that grace is inſpired into our ſoules, and ſanctification, and new obedience, and Chriſt is made vnto vs of God, wiſedome, righteouſneſſe, ſanctification, and redemption:
                  1. Cor. 1. 30. by which it appeareth, that we aſcribe euen as much in this regard to Chriſts merits, as they do; and therefore this is a mere cauill and ſlander, hatcht by them to breed diſgrace

to our Religion. Next, they contradict themſelues: for to ſay, that Chriſt giueth ſtrength to our righteouſneſſe to purchaſe heauen, is to affi
                     •
                  me, that without our helpe, Chriſts righteouſneſſe was not of ſufficient valew to make that purchaſe: and yet the ſame men ſay, that Chriſts righteouſneſſe was of infinite valew. Now if it were of infinite valew, then it made the full and perfect purchaſe it ſelfe: and if it made the full purchaſe, then he need not giue ſtrength to our righteouſnes to doe the ſame. Thus either the one or the other muſt needes be falſe, except we will haue a double purchaſe of one and the ſame thing, and a double ſatisfaction of the ſame debt, which is in no caſe agreeable to the iuſtice of God. Laſtly, they ſhew their arrogancie, in that they ſcorne to receiue the kingdome of heauen, as an almes and free gift from God of his mere mercy towards them: but they will haue it like ſturdy and proud companions, as a due vnto their deſerts, or a recompence to their ſeruice: nay, they will not haue it fromBel. de purgat▪ lib. 1. cap. 14. Chriſts purchaſe alone, but they will bee ioyned purchaſers with him, or elſe they will haue none of it: then which, what can be greater arrogancie? And thus by this vaine vaunt they fall into diuers palpable abſurdities, and plainely diſcouer, that it cannot any way be auoyded, but that by their doctrine of iuſtification, they doe exalt the dignity of man, and pull downe the glory of Chriſt our Sauiour.
               24. The third doctrine whereby they derogate from Gods3. glory, is their monſter of merit, which I put in the next place, becauſe it iſſueth from the two former, as the Progenitours thereof, the doctrine of iuſtification by inherent righteouſneſſe, being as it were the mother of it, and that of free-will the Grand-mother: and ſo it cannot be, the fountaine being poyſoned, but that the waters ſtreaming there-from, muſt needes be infected: and becauſe malum creſcit eundo, an euill groweth worſe by propagation, and the daughter commonly exceedeth the mother in naughtineſſe, therefore this doctrine is firre more blaſphemous, then either of the former, and exceedeth them, both in derogating from Gods glory, and ſetting vp mans dignity againſt God. And the Proctors of the

Romiſh Court, in no ſubiect doe more throat it out, then they doe in this, nor take more paines in any, as if their liuelyhood lay vpon it. And yet, if we draw neere vnto them, we ſhall eaſily perceiue, that all is but a vaine blaſt of words puffing vp the proud heart of man, and pulling downe the glory of Chriſt, as I hope I ſhall plainely and briefly manifeſt by the diſcourſe following.
               25. Their doctrine touching the merite of workes, is in briefe this, that there is ſuch a dignity, excellency, and perfection in the workes of the Regenerate, that by the rule of iuſtice they doe not onely deſerue temporall and ſpirituall bleſſings here in this world, but alſo eternall life and euerlaſting bliſſe in the world to come. In which doctrine, theſe three poynts are to be conſidered: firſt, that they make the good workes of the faithfull abſolutely and perfectly good,Bell▪ de iuſt. li. 4. cap. 16. able to ſtand out with the iuſtice of God, and anſwere the full rigour of the Law: ſecondly, they make them proportionable to the reward, for betwixt meritum and debitum, properly taken, as they doe, there is alwaies a Geometricall proportion: and thirdly, they place this meritorious dignitie in the worke done, as it is a worke, and that not paſſiuely, as it is wrought in vs by grace, but actiuely as it worketh by freewill, as hath beene ſhewed.
               26. That all theſe things are thus, as I haue ſaid, let vs heare themſelues ſpeaking in their owne words. The workes of the

                  iuſt (ſaith Bellarmine) are ſimply and abſolutely good. And in another place, They are ſo good and ſo perfect, that God were

And to prooue this, hee produceth ſeuen ſtrong reaſons, as he thinketh, but indeed weake ones, if they be throughly examined.

                  Greg. de Valen. tom. 3. diſp. 7. q. 2 de Indulgent. 
                  as the prize due vnto their labours. Gregory de Ʋalentia goeth yet further, and ſaith, That the workes of the faithfull, beſide their ſtrength of meriting, haue alſo a power of ſatisfying for the puniſhment.
               
               27. Touching the proportion of our workes, with the reward, Bellarmine ſaith, That in a good worke proceeding from
                  Bell. de Iuſt. li. 5▪ cap. 17. 
                  grace, there is a certaine proportion and equality, to the reward of eternall life, and that not only in regard of the promiſe and acceptation, but euen of the worke it ſelfe. And this he proueth in the place quoted by many arguments, which are worthy to be read, that we may ſee the very pith and ſubſtance of their opinion, touching the merite of workes. True it is, Bellarmine doth not make this proportion an abſolute equality betwixt the worke and the reward, according to the rule of commutatiue
                  Idem li. 5. ca. 16. 
                  iuſtice, but onely by the rule of diſtributiue iuſtice, which hath reſpect not ſo much to the worke, as to the worthineſſe of the perſon working. But herein he croſſeth other his fellow Ieſuites; For Suarez ſaith, That a ſupernaturall worke proceeding
                  Suarez. tom. 1. in Thom. 3. d. 41. Sect. 3. Coſt. Ench. ca. 7. 
                  from grace, within it ſelfe, and of it owne nature, hath a proportion and condignity with the reward, and a ſufficient valew to be worth the ſame. And C
                        •
                     ſter affirmeth, that the reward which God giueth to our workes, belongeth after a ſort both to commutatiue and diſtributiue iuſtice, though the diſtributiue part of iuſtice, which requireth the dignity of the perſons, doth more ſhine forth in it then the commutatiue, which conſidereth the equality of workes. And the Rhemiſts, That our workes of their
                  Rhem. Annot. in 1. Cor. 3. 8. 
                  very nature deſerue eternall life, the reward whereof is a thing equally and iuſtly anſwering to the lyne and weight of the worke,
                  
                  rather then a free gift. Yea, he croſſeth himſelfe, for in the ſeuenteenth chapter, he auoucheth that the proportion betwixt the worke and the reward, is ratione operis, in reſpect of the worke. Now I confeſſe that ſome of them affirme indeed, the reaſon of meriting of our workes, to ariſe partly from this that we are adopted the ſonnes of God, and haue vnion with Chriſt, and ſo they are made meritorious by the dignity of the perſon which worketh them: and partly becauſe they proceede from grace; and alſo, partly by reaſon of the promiſe which God hath made vnto them, whereby hee bindeth himſelfe that he will reward them: but let all theſeAndr. Orth. explicat. lib. 6. Caiet. 1. 2. q. 114. Bayus de merit. lib. 2. ca. 1. & 4. be granted (though all of them bee denyed by many of their owne Writers, who attribute merite to the worke, without relation either to the perſon, or to grace, or to the promiſe) yet it will not free their doctrine from palpable impiety, as the ſequent diſcourſe ſhall (I truſt) make apparant. After that I haue in oppoſition to this doctrine ſet downe the ſumme of that which we hold touching the dignity of good workes. I omit to name their merit of cōgruity, becauſe moſt of themſelues are aſhamed of it.
               28. This is therefore that doctrine which our Church maintaineth concerning good workes: Firſt, wee beleeue aſſuredly that good workes are neceſſary to ſaluation, but ſo, Vt via regni, non cauſae regnandi, as the way to the Kingdome,Bern. de grat. & lib. Arbitr. not cauſes of raigning, and as ſignes of our Election, and forerunners of our future happineſſe, as Saint Bernard teſtifieth. This with one conſent we all teach, and the Romaniſts that ſlander vs with the contrary aſſertion, cannot produce ſo much as one ſentence out of any of our Writers, which being rightly vnderſtood, doth import the contrary, as ſhall be hereafter fully proued. Secondly, wee hold, that as they are neceſſary in reſpect of vs, ſo they are acceptable and well pleaſing to God, not for their own ſakes, but for our faith-ſake in Chriſt, in whome onely the Lord is well pleaſed, both towards himſelfe and all his members. Thirdly, we beleeue that they are not onely thus acceptable and well pleaſing in Gods ſight, but alſo that the Lord will reward them aſſuredly both in this

life with temporall bleſſings, and in the life to come with eternall happineſſe; according to that of our Sauiour, Whoſoeuer
                  Mat. 10. 42. 
                  ſhall giue vnto one of thoſe little ones to drinke a cup of cold water, in the name of a Diſciple, he ſhall not loſe his reward. But laſtly, we conſtantly aſſure our ſelues, that this reward is not giuen of God for the merite or deſert of the worke, but of the meere grace and mercy of God for the merits of Chriſt: according to that of Saint Bernard, The mercy of God is my merite:
                  Ber. in Cā. ſer. 61 Aug. de grat. & lib. arbit. cap. 9. and of Saint Augustine, God bringeth vs to eternall life, not for our merits, but for his owne mercy. For a reward is not onely taken for a due debt in Scripture, but alſo for a free gift, as may appeare by comparing Mat. 5. 46. with Luk. 6. 32.Mat. 5. 46. Luke 6. 32. In the one place wherof the Holy Ghoſt vſeth the word 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , in the other 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , ſpeaking of the one and the ſame thing. So that the ſumme of our doctrine is this in few words, wee renounce not good workes, but the merit of workes: and wee verily beleeue that Chriſt is the ſtore-houſe of all merite, and that out of him there is no merite to be found in any, no not in the iuſteſt that euer liued: and yet the merits of Chriſt, as his righteouſneſſe, are made ours by imputation; and in that ſenſe onely we may bee ſaid to merit and deſerue eternall life. As for our beſt workes, though they bee wrought in vs by grace, yet paſſing through the corrupt channell of our defiled nature, they get themſelues ſuch a tincture and ſtaine, as in regard of the corruption which cleaueth cloſe vnto them, they can deſerue nothing at Gods hand, if he ſhould lay them to the rule of his iuſtice, and not weigh them in the ballance of his mercy. This is our doctrine: and that it is ſo, I appeale to Bellarmine himſelfe, who confeſſeth, that by faith alone wee
                  Bell. de iuſt. li. 4. cap. 1. 
                  doe not exclude other vertues, but the merit of them; and that we make good workes neceſſary to ſaluation, Neceſſitate praeſentiae, non efficientiae, as he termeth it, By neceſſitie of their preſence, not by neceſſitie of efficiencie. Let vs therefore now come to the examination of both theſe doctrines, and ſearch which of them doth giue moſt glory to God, and honour to Chriſt our Sauiour in this maine pillar of our Redemption.
               29. And firſt, doth not that doctrine tend manifeſtly to

the embaſing of Gods mercy, which teacheth men not to relie wholly vpon that for their ſaluation, but partly vpon their owne merits? Eſpecially, ſeeing grace and workes, merit and mercy, cannot ſtand together, no more then light andRom. 1
                        •
                     . 6. darknes, as the Apoſtle teacheth, If it be of grace, it is no more of workes, or elſe were grace no more grace; but if it be of workes, it is no more grace, or elſe were worke no more worke. So may we truely ſay, If ſaluation be of mercy, then it is not of merit, or elſe were mercy no more mercy; but if it be of merit, it is no more of mercy, or elſe were merit no more merit: and ſo by kindling the fire of merits, they vtterly dry vp the fountaine of mercy. And for that cauſe Saint Bernard maketh theQuo ſupra. mercy of God his onely merit. And Saint Auguſtine diſclayming all merits, and laying clayme onely to Gods mercy, ſaith as before; God bringeth vs to eternall life, not for our merits, but for his owne mercie: And in another place, His promiſe
                  Aug. in Pſal. 88. 
                  is ſure, not according to our merits, but according to his
                  Chryſoſt. in Coloſ. hom. 2. 
                  mercy. And Chryſoſtome ſaith, That no man ſheweth ſuch conuerſation of life, as that he may bee worthy of the Kingdome of heauen, but it is wholly the gift of God. In all theſe places merit is oppoſed vnto mercy, as things of their owne condition incompatible, and therefore one muſt needes exclude the other.Aug. cont. Pelag. & Celeſt. lib. 2. cap. 24. And ſure in reaſon it muſt needs be ſo, for mercy is free, Grace is not grace in any ſort, if it be not free in euery ſort (ſayth Auguſtine) but merit requireth the reward of debt: Mercies obiect is miſery and vnworthineſſe, but merit is dignity and worthineſſe, and therefore cannot bee the obiect of mercy: Mercy reioyceth againſt iuſtice, but merit appealeth vnto iuſtice, and challengeth God of vniuſtice, if it bee not recompenced. Laſtly, in mercy, God is the Agent, and ſinfull Man the Patient; but in merit, righteous Man is the Agent, and God the Patient. And therefore, betwixt theſe two things, Merit and Mercy, there is ſuch a diſproportion and contrariety, that they cannot be reconciled together.
               30. I but they ſay, our workes are not meritorious of themſelues, but partly as they proceede from grace, and are wrought in vs by Gods Spirit, and ſo it is Gods mercy, that

we are enabled to merit; and partly by vertue of Gods promiſe, whereby hee hath engaged himſelfe to crowne thoſe merits with glory, which he hath wrought in vs by grace: to which double obiection I returne this double anſwere. Firſt, if all good workes iſſue from the roote of grace, as they doe indeede, then how can we merit thereby, ſeeing that which doth merit, muſt bee our owne, and not anothers, eſpecially his of whom we looke to merit? (So ſaith Hilary) it is for him
                  Hilar. de trinit. lib. 11. 
                  to merit, who himſelfe is to himſelfe the Author of getting his merit: and therfore if it be true which they affirme, that Gods grace is the onely fountaine of all good workes (as without doubt it is) it is ſo farre from following thence, that therefore our workes are meritorious, that it followeth by mere neceſſary conſequence, that therefore they are not meritorious. And this concluſion is made by diuers of the ancient Fathers themſelues, We haue nothing to reioyce or glory of (ſaith S. Cyprian)Cyprian ad Quir. lib. 3. c. 5. Bern. in annun. ſer. 1. 
                  therefore nothing to merit, becauſe we haue nothing of our owne: The merits of men are not ſuch (ſaith S. Bernard) as that life eternall by right is owing for them (and why?) becauſe all merits are the gifts of God; and ſo man is rather a debter to God for them, then God to man. And S. Auguſtine, Eternall life ſhould
                  Aug. epiſt. 105. 
                  be rendred as due vnto thee, if of thy ſelfe thou hadſt the righteouſneſſe, to which it is due: but now of his fulneſſe wee receiue not onely grace now to liue iustly in our labours to the end, but alſo grace for this grace, that afterward wee may liue in reſt without reſt. So then, if our good works ariſe only frō Gods grace, this maketh plaine againſt all merit, as they know well enough, and therfore (behold their fraud, and the myſterie of iniquity) though they ſhadow the matter with goodly words of grace and mercy, yet vpon free-will they hang the vertue and effect of this grace, and from that fountaine doe they deriue vnto man all this merit, which they talke ſo much of: and ſo howſoeuer they aſcribe vnto Gods grace the cauſe of merit, yetBel. de Iuſtific. lib. 5. cap. 10. in very deede with them, it is free-will that maketh a worke meritorious.
               31. Secondly, I anſwere, that when God doth promiſe to reward our workes with eternall life, eternall life is due to vs,

but not for our workes ſake, but for his promiſe ſake: for many things are due by promiſe, which haue no reference to any deſert. As if the King ſhould promiſe one of his ſeruants a thouſand pound of his mere liberality, for keeping a Hawke, he is bound to pay him ſo much: but is it from the ſeruants deſert, or from the Kings bounty? So God promiſeth eternall life to our workes, and by reaſon of his promiſe, wee may challenge it as our due, but yet it is not for our worke, but for his word ſake, as Saint Auguſtine confeſſeth, when he ſaith: God is become a debter, not by receiuing
                  Aug. de verbis Apoſtol. ſer. 16. 
                  any thing from vs, but by promiſing what it pleaſed him: therfore a reward giuen by promiſe, is ſo far frō importing deſert, that it rather ouerthroweth the very foundation thereof, by being a worke of mercy: as the ſame Auguſtine ſaith in another place: The promiſe is ſure, not according to our merits, but according to his mercy. The doctrine of merit then vndermineth the mercy of God, which way ſo euer they turne themſelues, whether to grace, as the cauſe of the worke, or to Gods promiſe, as the cauſe of the reward.
               32. Againe, by this doctrine, not onely the mercy of God is darkened, but alſo the merits of Chriſt quite euacuated, and made of no force: for if Chriſts merits were ſufficient, what neede there then any ſupply of our owne: if our owne merits be neceſſarily required, then Chriſts merits were not ſufficient. If Chriſts merits were perfect, then mans merits cannot be added vnto them, for that is perfect, to which nothing can be added: but if mans merits muſt bee added to them, then it followeth, that Chriſts were not perfect; and ſo no merits at all: for this property is required in a merit, that it bee perfect: and ſo either they muſt denie the neceſſity of our meriting, or confeſſe the vnſufficiencie of Chriſt: either they muſt acknowledge Chriſts merits to be vnperfect, or ours to be vnneceſſarie, yea none at all. I but (they will ſay) Chriſt did not onely merit the pardon of our ſinnes, but alſo that our workes ſhould be meritorious of life euerlaſting: and by this (ſat they) are Chriſts merits more magnified then by vs, becauſe the greater the gift is, the greater is the glory of

the giuer: ſo that our meriting doth not argue any want in his merits, but rather proue a greater efficacie to be in them: for to this end will hee haue vs to merit, partly that we may ſhew our ſelues like vnto him, and partly to traine vs vp in good workes by this ſpurre. All theſe are but ſhifts, and indeede mere cauils, for firſt, to ſay, that Chriſt did not alone merit for vs eternall life, but alſo grace, that ſo we might merit eternall life for our ſelues: what is it, but to make vs our owne Sauiours; for all our merits come from grace and freewill ioyned together, as hath beene ſhewne, and grace is nothing with them, except free-will concurre with it: for they teach, that we may receiue it if we will, and when we haue it, we may merit, if we will, eternall life, or elſe goe without it. What is this (I ſay) but to affirme, that a man is not ſaued by Chriſts merits, but that by the helpe of grace hee doth ſaue himſelfe by his owne merits? and ſo they ſhoue Chriſt out of his office, and put themſelues in his roome.
               33. Secondly, I anſwere, that the efficacie of Chriſts merits, is greater in purchaſing eternall life for vs by himſelfe alone, then in giuing vs ableneſſe to merit it for our ſelues; becauſe it is a greater glory, and a token of greater power, to effect a thing immediatly without meanes, then by the mediation or vſurpation of any meanes whatſoeuer. In the former, all the honour is to the worker, in the later there muſt needes be ſome glory aſcribed to the meanes, and ſome power attributed vnto them: and therefore to ſay, that Chriſt hath onely merited by himſelfe without vs eternall life for vs, is to giue the entire and perfect glory vnto him, and none vnto our ſelues: and to affirme, that hee merited to make our workes meritorious, is to derogate from his glory, and to detract from the efficacie of his death and paſſion.
               34. And here we may ſee the vanity of Bellarmines aſſertion, who to proue, that by this doctrine of theirs, they aſcribeBel. Ibid. more efficacie to Chriſts merits then we doe, bringeth in this ſimilitude, Sicut quòd Deus, &c. that is, As in that God vſeth the Sunne to lighten the world, fire to heat it, ayre and raine to refreſh it, is not an argument of weakeneſſe in God, that hee cannot
                  
                  doe all theſe things by himſelfe without them, but rather of his omnipotencie, in that hee was not onely able to doe theſe things himſelfe, but alſo to giue power to thoſe creatures to doe them: ſo it is an argument of greater power in Christs merits, to giue ſtrength to our workes to merit heauen, then if hee did it for vs without our workes. I, but by Bellarmines leaue (that I may ſpeake with all humble reuerence to the diuine Maieſtie) the power of God had beene more manifeſt, and his omnipotencie more conſpicuous (I doe not ſay had beene greater) if he ſhould doe theſe things immediatly by himſelfe, then it is by the glaſſe of the creatures. As when the Lord came downe in perſon vpon mount Sinai, and gaue the children of Iſrael the law from his owne mouth, his glory was more famous and fearefull, then when hee ſent it them after by the hand of Moſes, though written with his owne finger, as the other was ſpoken with his owne mouth. And therefore it is ſaid, Exod. 20. that the people were ſo aſtoniſhed at Gods voyce, that they deſired, that hee would ſpeake no more vnto them in his owne perſon, but by his ſeruant Moſes. Adde herevnto, that God in his wiſedome ordayned thoſe creatures to that end and purpoſe, and therefore we muſt not diſpute (as Bellarmine doth) whether it ſhould haue beene a greater token of his omnipotencie, if hee had, or if hee had not created them; but humbly ſubmit our ſelues to his wiſedome, knowing, that his thoughts are not like ours, nor his counſels like ours,
                  Eſay 5
                        •
                     . 8. 9. 
                  but as the heauens are higher then the earth, ſo are his wayes higher than ours, and his thought aboue our thoughts: but for the merits of Chriſt, he hath reuealed in his word, that in them onely wee are to finde ſaluation: and therefore wee muſt beleeue, that he is moſt glorified by that doctrine, which teacheth vs to rely onely vpon them: and as for the power in them, to cauſe vs to merit, it is no where to be found in Scripture, and therefore not to be thought to be for the aduancement of his glory: beſides, to ſay, that Chriſts honour is encreaſed by mans merit, is plaine blaſphemie, for, who hath giuen any thing to God, Rom. 11. 25. He ſtandeth not in neede of our good
                  Rom. 11. 25. Pſal. 16. 2. 
                  decdes, Pſal. 16. 2. Indeede, we doe glorifie God by our good

workes, but that is not by encreaſing, but by publiſhing and proclaiming of his glory: but the Romaniſts ſay, that the glory of Chriſts merits is augmented by our merits, which muſt needes be a moſt blaſphemous ſpeech. In a word, ſeeing we doe not finde in Scripture, that Chriſt died to giue merit to our workes; but to purchaſe pardon to our ſinnes, and obtaine life for vs; wee muſt bee content to thinke that this ſerueth moſt for his glorie, and that the contrarie is derogatory thereunto.
               35. Laſtly, where did we euer read, that wee muſt be like vnto Chriſt in meriting? we read, that wee muſt bee holy as he is holy, and humble and meeke as hee was humble and meeke, and patient as he was patient; to wit, in quality, not in quantity, in imitation, not in perfection: but to merit as he did, is no where to be found: nay, it is a thing impoſſible, for it is an infinite and omnipotent worke of righteouſneſſe, that can deſerue any thing at the infinite iuſtice of the omnipotent God, and it muſt bee of infinite valew, that can purchaſe that infinite reward. And therefore it was neceſſarie, that he which ſhould be our Redeemer, ſhould alſo be God, becauſe neither Angell nor Archangell, nor any creature elſe could performe a worke of that price, which might be ſufficient to merit the kingdome of heauen. It is therefore a moſt groſſe blaſphemie, to ſay, that we muſt be like vnto Chriſt in the point of meriting: for it maketh euery man a Ieſus, that is, a Sauiour and Redeemer to himſelfe. Therefore to conclude, I ſay with S. Bernard, Let the glory remaine to the Lord vntouched,
                  Bern. in Cant. ſer. 13. 
                  he hath triumphed ouer the enemie alone, he hath freed the captiues alone, hee hath fought and conquered alone: and with S. Augustine, To whom we are endebted for that we are, to him we
                  Auguſt. in Pſal. 144. 
                  are endebted, that wee are iustified: let none attribute to God his being, and to himſelfe his iustifying; for it is better which thou giueſt to thy ſelfe, than that which thou giueſt vnto God; thou giueſt the lower thing vnto God, and the higher to thy ſelfe, giue all to him, praiſe him in all. This wee doe by our doctrine, and they the contrary: and therefore it is moſt manifeſt, that by this doctrine of theirs, mans glory is exalted,

and Chriſts defaced, mans merits lifted vp, and Chriſts pulled downe, which cannot ſtand with the truth and ſincerity of Chriſtian Religion.
               36. The fourth doctrine which tendeth directly to the diſhonor4. of God, & the abaſing of Chriſts glory in the worke of our redemption, is their paradox of humane ſatisfactions: by which they teach, that Chriſt by his death hath made ſatisfaction for the guilt of our ſinnes, and the eternall puniſhment due vnto them, but wee our ſelues muſt ſatisfie the iuſtice of God, for the temporall puniſhment either in earth or in Purgatory: whereas we on the contrary teach and beleeue, that by Chriſts death and paſſion, a perfect and all-ſufficient ſatiſfaction is made to the iuſtice of God, for all the ſinnes of men, and for all the puniſhment thereof, both eternall and temporall. As for our doings or ſufferings, we acknowledge the one to be ſabordinately required as fruites of our faith, and the other neceſſary to be ſuſtained as meanes of our mortification. And touching offences againſt our brethren, we hold it neceſſary that we make ſatisfaction to ſuch whom we haue wronged any wayes, either by confeſſion, reſtitution, or puniſhment, as the caſe ſhall require; yea, wee acknowledge that a Canonicall or Eccleſiaſticall ſatisfaction is to be made to the Church, or any part thereof, when as we haue giuen iuſt ſcandall and offence there vnto. But in all theſe wee denie, that there is any vertue or power to expiate our ſinnes, or to make ſatisfaction to God for the puniſhment thereof, either temporall or eternall; that to do, is only proper and peculiar to the Croſſe of Chriſt: for as the diſobedience of the firſt Adam brought vpon vs not onely eternall puniſhments, but alſo temporall; ſo the obedience and merit of the ſecond Adam, hath made ſatisfaction to God for both.
               37. And herein we agree both with the holy Scripture in many expreſſe places, as 1. Iohn 2. 2. He is the propitiation for our ſinnes. And Rom. 5. 18. For the eternall puniſhment of them: And Eſay 53. 4. For the temporall; for there it is ſaid, that he tooke vpon him our infirmities, and bore our ſickneſſes. And with the holy Fathers; for Saint Auguſtine plainly affirmeth,

                  That temporal afflictions before forgiuenes, are the puniſhments of

Iul. cap. 8. the Councill of Trent it ſelfe, that when God forgiueth a ſinner, yet he forgiueth not all the puniſhment, but leaueth the party by his owne workes to ſatisfie till it bee waſhed away, and that the bloud of Chriſt doth not ſerue to acquite vs from the temporall puniſhment,

                  but that we muſt acquite our ſelues, either by our owne works, as prayer, almes, & faſting, &c. or by our ſuffrings, either in this life, or in Purgatory. Yes, ſome of the chiefeſt of them areGreg. de Valent. tō. 4. diſp. 7. q 14. bold to auouch, that the recōpence made by ſatisfaction, reſpecteth not only the temporall puniſhment, but ſome part of the offence alſo, and the wrath of God.

                  Caict. Soto. Suar. tom. 1. d. 4. l. 9. 
                  grace of God may ſatisfie for his ſinne condignely, and equally, and by that ſatisfaction obtaine pardon. And that which is more then all the reſt, ſome of them affirme without bluſhing, that Chriſt by his ſacrifice on the Croſſe ſatisfied onely for originall ſinne, and not for actuall after Baptiſme. Bellarmine indeed isBell. de miſſa. li. 2 cap. 2. aſhamed of this doctrine, as he might well bee, but yet it is plainely maintained by Gregorie de Ʋalentia. And this in briefe is the dunghill of Popiſh ſatisfactions, from whence ſteame forth like vapours, their Purgatorie, and Pardons, and Penance, and much more ſuch like trumpery.
               39. But let vs leaue them to their manifold errours, and come to the examination of this one poynt, whether they or we bring more diſhonour to the Croſſe of Chriſt. And to the purpoſe, firſt, the very nature of ſatisfaction, which as they affirme, is the yeelding of a ſufficient recompence to God for a treſpaſſe committed, is inough to prooue that their doctrine tends to the ſingular impeachment of the Croſſe of Chriſt: for if Chriſt hath made a full and perfect ſatisfaction vpon the Croſſe, as without all doubt he did, he himſelfe conteſting in that his laſt ſpeech, It is finiſhed; then what neede any addition

of humane ſatisfactions? If there be ſuch a neceſſity of humane ſatisfactions, as they make, then Chriſts ſatiſfaction muſt needs be imperfect, and ſo no ſatisfaction at all: for an imperfect ſatisfaction is no ſatisfaction, as the very word it ſelfe implyeth, importing a ſufficient recompence to be made to the party offended: And if it be perfect, it muſt be full and abſolute, that is, ſuch as needeth nothing elſe to be added vnto it. But they require ſomething to be added to Chriſts ſatisfaction; and therefore muſt needs hold that it is not a full, perfect, and abſolute ſatisfaction: for it implyeth a manifeſt contradiction to affirme any thing to be a full and perfect cauſe of it ſelfe alone, and yet to adde another to it, as a ioynt cauſe to produce the ſame effect.
               40. But they will anſwere, that mans ſatisfaction is not to ſupply the want of Chriſts, but to apply it vnto vs, and to fulfill his will and ordinance: for Chriſts ſatisfaction (ſay they)Coſt. Ench. p. 395 Biſh. contra Refor. Cathal. Bell. de poenit. li. 4. cap. 14. is of infinite value, and might aſwell haue taken away the temporall puniſhment, as the eternall, but that God will haue it otherwiſe, for the mortifying of ſinne in vs, and making vs conformable to Chriſt our head. This anſwere of theirs may ſeeme to carry a ſhew of ſound reaſon, but in very deed it is but a ſhift, and a golden couer to blanch the vglineſſe of their doctrine, for it were odious for them to ſay plainely, that Chriſts ſatisfaction ſtood in need of a ſupply, or was any wayes imperfect; and therefore they would not haue men to thinke ſo of them, though in truth they both thinke and ſpeake ſo of Chriſt, when they a little forget what they are a doing, and by infallible conſequence their doctrine concludeth no leſſe: for plaine ſpeech thus writeth Gabriel Biel, Though the paſſion of
                  Biel. ca. 3. d. 19. art. 2. concl. 5. 
                  Chriſt be the principall merit, for which the grace of God, and the opening of heauen, and the glory thereof be giuen; yet it is neither the ſole nor totall meritorious cauſe, but alwaies there concurreth ſome worke of him that receiueth the grace. And Miletus,
                  Milet. li. Diſcuſſ. 
                  Chriſt indeed is the generall cauſe of our ſaluation, but yet particular cauſes are to be added to this, and ſo he is not the totall and whole cauſe. And Bellarmine himſelfe by conſequenceBel. de Purgat. lib. 1. cap. 14. confeſſeth as much, when he ſaith, that a righteous man hath
                  
                  right to the Kingdome of heauen by a two-fold title, one of the merits of Chriſt, another of his owne merits. Theſe bee plaine ſpeeches, and ſhew what their meaning is: ſo that howſoeuer they gloze ouer the matter with goodly words, yet it is nothing but poyſon in a painted boxe, wherewith the ignorant may be infected, but the skilfull are able to diſcerne their fraud. And here obſerue the contrariety of Bellarmines ſpeech to another ſaying of S. Bernard to the ſame purpoſe. Christ
                  Bernard. (ſaith Saint Bernard) hath a double right vnto the kingdome of heauen, one by inheritance, as he is the Sonne of God, another by purchaſe, as he bought it by his death, the firſt he keepeth to himſelfe, this latter he imparts to his members. This by S. Bernards Diuinitie is all the right that a faithfull man hath to the kingdome of heauen, by Chriſts purchaſe: and vpon this onely doth that good man, and all other of Gods children relie: but Bellarmine giueth him another title, to wit, by purchaſe of his owne merits, which as it is a ſtraine of his owne wit: ſo let him keepe it to himſelfe, and make merry with it, for wee will haue nothing to doe with it.
               41. As for that which they ſay, that our ſatisfactions ſerue not to ſupply the want, but to apply the efficacie of Chriſts vnto vs, is a more ridiculous and ſhifting deuice then the other: for firſt, how can that be, when as ſinne is firſt pardoned, which is by the ſatisfaction of Chriſt? and then long after commeth our ſatisfaction, if not in this life, yet ſure in Purgatorie. The applying of a thing, is a preſent act, ariſing betwixt the agent and the patient, therefore if our ſatisfaction doe apply Chriſts vnto our ſoules, then it followeth, that Chriſt hath not ſatisfied for our ſinnes, till wee haue ſatisfied for the temporall puniſhment of them, which is flat contrarie to their owne principles. Secondly, that which applieth, hath relation to that which is applied, as to the obiect: but our ſatisfaction hath no relation to Chriſts ſatisfaction, as the obiect, but is onely referred to the temporall puniſhment, and to the iuſtice of God, as they affirme, therefore it cannot apply it vnto vs. And laſtly, how diſſonant is it vnto reaſon, that a ſatisfaction ſhould apply a ſatisfaction, as if one medicine

ſhould apply another to the patient. It is the hand that applieth the medicine, and not another medicine: ſo it is faith that applieth Chriſts ſatisfaction vnto our ſinnes, and not our ſatisfaction. Nay, except the merits of Chriſt be applied to our beſt works and ſufferings, they cannot ſtand before Gods iuſtice, neither can they be meritorious, as they themſelues confeſſe: ſo that it will follow by this doctrine, that our ſatiſfactions are both the hand to apply Chriſts, and the thing to which it is applied. All which is moſt repugnant, not only to Religion, but euen to reaſon it ſelfe.
               42. Laſtly, when as Bellarmine affirmeth, that ad maiorem,
                  Bel. de Purgat. lib. 1. cap. 10. 
                  &c. that is, for the greater glory of God who is ſatisfied, and the greater honour of man ſatisfying, it pleaſed Christ to ioyne his ſatisfaction to ours: He plainely diſcouereth the ſcope of their doctrine, to bee the aduancement of the dignity of man; whereunto indeede he ioyneth the glory of God (for elſe all men would cry fie vpon ſuch a Religion:) but yet it both detracteth greatly from the glory of God, in aſcribing ſome dignity vnto man, and peruerteth the true end of the Goſpel, which is not the partial, but the entire honor & glory of God: For, as S. Paul ſaith, Gods power is moſt clearly ſeene in our weaknes,
                  1. Cor. 12. 9. Dan. 1. 7. 
                  and his righteouſnes in the confeſſion of our ſhame, & his glory in our baſenes and vilenes, that no fleſh might reioyce in his preſence, but that he onely might be exalted at that day. But by this1. Cor. 1. 29. Romiſh doctrine, euery iuſt mā may reioyce in his own dignity, & may lift vp himſelfe in the preſence of God; as if he were the ioynt cauſe of his own ſaluation together with Chriſt, and that Chriſts ſatisfaction had beene nothing auaileable to him, except he had applied it to himſelfe by his owne ſatisfaction.
               43. Thus they deuide ſaluation, as it were party parpale betwixt Chriſt and man, and paralell them together. And whereas they ſay, that we muſt be like vnto Chriſt, as in meriting, ſo in ſatisfying; what doe they but intrude man into the fellowſhip of Chriſts office? for our imitation of Chriſt ſtandeth in a conformity to his conuerſation and life, and of thoſe things onely which concerne his perſon, and are imitable, but not in being like vnto him in his office: and therefore

when they ſay, that we muſt be like vnto Chriſt in ſatiſfying, they make euery man that is ſaued, a Ieſus and Sauiour to himſelfe, becauſe they make him to imitate him in thoſe things, wherein conſiſteth his being our Chriſt. Then which, what can be more contrary to the honour of Chriſt?
               44. Theſe bee the foure principall poynts, whereby the glory of Gods mercy, and Chriſts merits, and the holy Ghoſts grace is greatly defaced, and in ſtead thereof, mans nature and merits exalted. Beſides theſe, there are diuers other doctrines of the Church of Rome, which bring forth the ſame fruit, ſome of which, I will onely name, and ſo conclude this th
                     •••
                   argument. And firſt, by the doctrine of the Popes ſupremacie, they detract from the power of Chriſt, and conſequently from his glory: for both they endow the Pope with thoſe titles, which properly belong to Chriſt, as to be the Father
                  Bel. de Concil. lib. 2. cap. 17. 
                  in Gods family, the vniuerſall Paſtor, the head of the Church, the husband and bridegroome of it: and all other names which are giuen to our Sauiour Chriſt in holy Scripture (whereby it is ſhewne, that he is aboue the Church:) and alſo they attribute the ſame power to the Pope, which belongeth properly to Chriſt, as to pardon ſinne, to diſpenſe with the law of God, to open and ſhut the gates of heauen, not miniſterially, but abſolutely and iudicially, to depoſe Kings, and to diſpoſe of Kingdomes, and ſuch like. Now, what a diſhonour is this to him, in whoſe thigh is written this glorious title, The King of Kings? Hee muſt not be the onely head of the Church, but the Pope muſt be a ioynt head with him, nor hee the ſole Gouernor, but the Pope muſt be his Vicar: nor the ſole husband of the Church, but the Pope, in his abſence, muſt be her huſband in his roome. Could a mortall man endure this iniurie? And doe wee thinke that the Sonne of God will beare it? Either Chriſt is not able to gouerne alone, or not willing; they will not ſay not able, leſt their blaſphemy ſhould be too too odious: and if they ſay, not willing: how can hee not be willing to maintaine his owne glory, or not bee vnwilling to be confederated with a ſinfull Pope (for ſo often they are) in the diſpoſition of his Kingdome? Let them make the beſt that

they can of it: yet it appeareth, that Chriſts gouernment is diuided betwixt the Pope and him, and ſo muſt the glory alſo needs be diuided,
               45. Secondly, by their doctrine of the Inuocation and Interceſſion of Saints, what doe they but diuide the office, and ſo the glory of the Mediatour-ſhip, betwixt Chriſt and them? for they teach that Chriſt is our Mediatour of Redemption, but the Saints Mediatours of Interceſſion, whereas we with the Scripture make Chriſt Ieſus to be the onely and ſole Mediatour both of Redemption and Interceſſion. Wee honour the Saints, but wee pray vnto God alone in the name of his Sonne; they adore the Saints, and make their prayers vnto them as well as vnto God: yea, more prayers do they powre out by numbers vnto them, then vnto God. What is to diſhonour God and Chriſt, if this be not?
               46. Thirdly, by their doctrine of traditions, they derogate greatly from the glory of Gods mercy towards his Church: for they hold that the written word is not ſufficient for a Chriſtian man to ſaluation, without the helpe of Eccleſiaſticall traditions: whereby they plainely inſinuate, that either God had not that care of his family the Church, as he might haue had, ſeeing hee left not for it a perfect and certaine rule for the gouernment thereof, but ſent it ouer to vncertaine traditions; or that wiſedome which all Law-giuers labour to attaine vnto, ſeeing hee could not at the firſt prouide for all future occaſions; or that loue that he would not: one of theſe doth neceſſarily follow from their doctrine.
               47. Laſtly, by their doctrine of worſhipping of Images, whereby they giue vnto ſtockes and ſtones part of that religious worſhip which is due vnto God. We teach that all religious worſhip is due vnto God alone. They on the contrary maintaine, that latria, that is, diuine worſhip is Gods due; but dulia, that is, ſeruice is to be giuen to Images. Yea, that the Crucifixe is to be worſhipped with diuine worſhip, which is due onely to God. Who ſeeth not what manifeſt iniury they offer to Gods glory, by this ſuperſtitious worſhip of dumbe and dead Images?
               
                  48. And thus, omitting many other like poynts which might be inſerted in this place, I hope that the Minor propoſition is ſufficiently demonſtrated, that the Church of Rome doth by many doctrines derogate from the glory of God, and the merits of Chriſt. And therefore the concluſion muſt needs follow, being built vpon an vnmooueable foundation, that, that Religion which maintaineth ſuch doctrines, is not the truth of Chriſt, but the ſeduction of Antichriſt.
            
            
               
                  MOTIVE. V. That Religion deſerueth to be ſuſpected, which refuſeth to be tryed by the Scriptures, as the perfect and alone rule of faith, and will bee iudged and tryed by none but it ſelfe: But ſuch is the Religion of the Church of Rome: Ergo.
               THe firſt propoſition in this Argument, though it be moſtMAIOR. true, and cannot without any ſhew of reaſon be contradicted: yet that it may be without all doubt and exception, it ſhall not be amiſſe to ſtrengthen the ſame by ſound and euident proofes, deriued both out of Gods word, and conſent of ancient Fathers. The Propoſition conſiſts of two parts, firſt, that it cannot be the true Religion, which will not abide the alone tryall of the Scriptures. Secondly, that it will bee iudged and tryed by none but it ſelfe; let vs conſider of both theſe ſeuerally.
               2. And concerning the firſt, if the Scripture be the fountaine of all true religion, the foundation and baſis of our faith, the Canon and rule of all the doctrines of faith, and the touch-ſtone to trye truth from falſhood, then to refuſe to be iudged and tryed by the Scriptures alone, is, plainely to diſcouer that there is ſomething in it which iſſued not from that fountain, which is not built vpon that foundation, which is ſo oblique and crooked, that it dares not to be applyed to that rule, and which is counterfeit, and dares not abide the touchſtone. Now that the Scripture is ſuch, as I haue ſaid, let the Holy Ghoſt, ſpeaking in the Scripture, beare witneſſe, Search
                  Ioh. 5. 39.
                  
                  the Scripture (ſaith our Sauiour) for in them you thinke to haue eternall life, and they be they which teſtifie of me: therefore the Scripture is the fountaine of all true religion: for, what is the Religion of Chriſtians, but the right knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus? This cauſed Saint Paul to ſay, I deſire to know
                  1. Cor. 2. 2. 
                  nothing, but Christ Ieſus, and him crucified. Againe, the Scriptures are able to make vs wiſe vnto ſaluation, through faith in
                  2. Tim. 3. 15. 
                  Chriſt Ieſus: and are profitable to teach, to improue, to correct, and to inſtruct in righteouſneſſe, that the man of God may be abſolute, and perfect to euery good worke. Therefore the Scripture is the onely fountaine of true Religion: for what is true Religion, but ſpirituall wiſedome and holy perfection, the one in contemplation, the other in action, the one in knowledge, the other in practice: for theſe 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   two ioyned together, do make a man truly religious, but the Scriptures afford both, as it is cleare in that ſaying of S. Paul, and may be confirmed by another like ſpeech of Salomon, who affirmeth, that the commandements
                  Pro 2. 9. 
                  of God will make a man to vnderſtand righteouſneſſe, and iudgement, and equity, and euery good path. Righteouſneſſe and iudgement pertaine to knowledge, equity, and euery good path belong to practice. And for this cauſe, Origen compareth the Scriptures to Iacobs Well, from whence not onely Iacob,
                  Orig. in Mat. 4. 
                  and his ſonnes, that is, the learned and the skilfull, but his ſheepe and cattell, that is, the ſimple and ignorant doe drinke, that is, deriue vnto themſelues the waters of life and ſaluation: and therefore where the knowledge of the Scriptures flouriſhed not, as among all the Heathen, both Romanes, Grecians, and Barbarians before their conuerſion, there no true Religion ſhewed it ſelfe, but their Religion was all falſe and deuilliſh: for, in ſtead of the true God, they worſhipped dumb creatures, and mortall men: yea, deuils themſelues, as Lactantius
                  Lactant. de falſa Relig. ſheweth. All which proceeded from hence, that they had not the word of God for their guide, which is the onely fountaine and well-ſpring of true Religion.
               3. Againe, as it is the fountaine from whence, ſo it is the foundation vpon which our faith relieth, whether wee take faith for the act of beleeuing, or for the matter and obiect of

our beliefe. Ye are built (ſaith S. Paul) vpon the foundation of
                  Epheſ. 2, 19. 20. 
                  the Prophets, and Apostles, Christ Ieſus himſelfe, being the chiefe corner ſtone. By the foundation of the Prophets and Apoſtles, is meant the Propheticall and Apoſtolicall doctrine, as all Expoſitours that I haue read; yea, their owne Aquinas and Caietane,
                  Aquin. Caietan. with one conſent auouch: and to bee built vpon this foundation, is to haue our faith to relye and depend vpon it onely, as a houſe relyeth onely vpon the foundation, and without a foundation cannot ſtand: that therefore is no doctrine of faith, that is vpholden by any other foundation, neither hath that any good foundation, which is not built vpon the Propheticall and Apoſtolicall doctrine; they build vpon ſand, that build vpon humane traditions, euery ſtormy puffe of winde will ſhake the houſe of that faith: but they which heare the word of Christ, and keepe it, build vpon a rocke, againſt
                  Math. 7. 23. 
                  which, neither the raine, flouds, nor windes, no not the gates of hell are able to preuaile; becauſe they are grounded vpon the rocke: which rocke indeede is Christ, to ſpeake properly, as1. Pet. 2. 7. not onely S. Peter confeſſeth, 1. Pet. 2. 7. but euen Chriſt himſelfe, that is this rocke: Math. 16. 18. when hee ſaith, 
                     Ʋpon
                  Math. 16. 18. 
                  this rocke will I build my Church: that is vpon this truth, that Chriſt is the Sonne of God: yet the word of Chriſt may alſo be called the rocke, becauſe it is as firme and durable as Chriſt himſelfe. And that wee may know, that Gods word1. Pet. 1. 25. onely is the foundation of faith, S. Paul telleth vs plainely, that faith is by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. If anyRom. 10. 17. of them ſay (as they doe) that the word of God is not onely that which is written in Scripture, but that which is vnwritten, deliuered by tradition: let them ſhew as good reaſons, to proue their traditions to be the word of God, as we doe to proue the Scripture, and we will beleeue them: but ſince they cannot, let them beare with vs, if we vnderſtand the Apoſtles words, as ſpoken onely touching the written word, and the rather, becauſe we haue for the warrantize of our interpretation, both S. Paul himſelfe in the ſame Chapter, verſe 8. when he ſaith, This is the word offaith which we preach. Where heeRom. 10. 8. ſheweth what is that word, which is the ground of our faith,

namely, the word preached. And S. Peter, who hauing magnified1. Pet. 1. 25. the word of God, with this commendation, that it endureth for euer, preſently expoundeth himſelfe of what word hee ſpake, ſaying, And this is that word which is preached amongst you: That is, the word of the Goſpell, which was not in part, but wholy and fully, as preached by mouth, ſo committed to writing. And thus S. Baſil alſo interprets it,
                     Baſil in 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . for he ſaith, Quicquid eſt vltra ſcripturas: Whatſoeuer is out of the Scriptures diuinely inſpired, becauſe it is not of faith, is ſinne: for faith is by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. Now from hence thus I reaſon. If the word of God written, be the onely ground of faith, then that Religion which will not acknowledge it, dependance onely vpon the word written, is not to be beleeued, but to be ſuſpected as erronious: but the word written is the onely ground of faith, as hath beene proued: therefore that Religion which diſclaymeth it dependance only vpon the word, deſerues iuſtly not to be beleeued, but to be ſuſpected as erronious: And in this regard, the Romiſh Religion, though it be in our Pater noster, to wit, vnder the laſt petition, Deliuer vs from euill, yet it ſhould neuer come into our Creed, to repoſe our faith and our ſaluation vpon it.
               4. Thirdly, the Scripture, as it is the fountaine and foundation of true Religion: So it is the rule of faith, and the touchſtone of doctrines, and the ballance of the Sanctuarie, to weigh truth and falſhood in, that the one may be diſcerned from the other. This the Prophet Eſay teacheth, when heeEſay 8. 20. calleth vs to the Law and to the Testimonie, ſaying, that if any ſpeake not according to that word, there is no light in them. From which place thus I reaſon: that whereunto we muſt reſort in all controuerſies, and doubts for reſolution, that is, the rule of faith: but ſuch is the Scripture, by the teſtimonie of the Prophet: therefore the Scripture is the rule of faith. In like manner, we may conclude, out of S. Peter, who ſaith, that We
                  2. Pet. 
                        •
                     . 19. 
                  haue a more ſure word of the Prophets, whereunto wee muſt take heede, as vnto a light that ſhineth in a darke place, till the Dayſtarre ariſe in our hearts. If the word of the Prophets was a ſure direction to the Church of God, before the Goſpell was

written; then much more is the whole Scripture, contayning the word of the Prophets and of the Apoſtles together; but S. Peter affirmeth the firſt, therefore the ſecond muſt needs follow. For this cauſe when one asked our Sauiour, what hee might doe to bee ſaued, hee referred him to the Scripture for his direction, What is written, how readeſt thou? And ſo Abraham
                  Luke 10. 26. referreth the rich gluttons brethren, to Moſes, and
                  Luke 16. 29. 
                  the Prophets: and Chriſt telleth the Saduces, that this was the cauſe of their errour, becauſe they knew not the Scriptures. OutMath 22. 29. of all which Texts, thus I argue, If there were any other rule of faith, beſides the ſacred Scripture, our Sauiour, and Saint Peter would neuer haue ſent vs ouer to the Scripture alone, but would haue poynted out vnto vs ſome other meanes: but they ſend vs to the Scripture alone: and therefore that alone is the rule and ballance of our faith.
               5. And this the very title and inſcription of the Scripture doth intimate: for why is it called Canonicall, but becauſe it containes the Canon, that is, the rule of faith and life? The Fathers with one conſent agree in this truth. Saint Baſil callsBaſil lib. 1. contr. Eunom. Chryſoſt. hom. 13 in 2. Coloſſ. Aug. de Baptiſt. contr. Donatiſt. lib. 2. cap. 6. the Scripture, Canonem recti, & normam veritatis, The Canon of right, and the rule of truth. Chryſoſtome ſayth, that Aſſertio diuinarum legum, &c. The aſſertion of the law of God is a moſt exact Ballance, Squire, and Rule. Saint Auguſtine calleth it Statera diuina, Gods ballance, or a diuine ballance: theſe bee his words, Non afferamus ſtateras doloſas: Let vs not bring deceitfull ballances to weigh what we will and how we will, ſaying, This is heauie, that is light: but let vs bring that diuine ballance out of the holy Scriptures, as it were out of the Lords treaſurie, and by it weigh all things, or rather acknowledge them, being
                  Tertul. contra Hermog. Greg. Nyſſ. orat. deijs qui adeunt Hieroſol. Grat. Decret. 
                  weighed by the Lord. Tertullian giueth to the Scripture the ſame name: ſo doth Gregory Nyſſen: and our Countriman venerable Bede, to paſſe ouer all the reſt, as he is reported by Gratian in his decrees, telleth vs in moſt plaine termes, that In ſacris literis vnica eſt credendi, pariter & viuendi regula praeſcripta: The onely rule both of Faith, and Life, is preſcribed vnto vs in the holy Scriptures. Now, if this be ſo, as it is meere madneſſe to affirme the contrary, then that religion which

doth refuſe to be tryed by this rule, and to be weighed in this ballance, doth giue iuſt cauſe of ſuſpition, that it is but light ſtuffe, and crooked ware.
               6. If a man ſhould offer to his creditor a piece of gold for payment, and ſhould refuſe to haue it either tryed by the touch-ſtone, or weighed in the ballance, he might iuſtly ſuſpect that it was but either light, or counterfeit: ſo may any of good ſenſe rightly ſuſpect that religion to bee both light, and counterfet, which refuſeth to be examined by the rule of Gods word, eſpecially (which is the ſecond branch of the firſt propoſition) if it not onely refuſe to be tryed by the Scripture, but alſo will admit no tryall, nor Iudge but it ſelfe: for as by reaſon wee conclude, that ſuch a man hath an euill cauſe in hand, who in Weſtminſter Hall refuſeth to haue his matter tryed by the law, and will admit no Iudge, but his own opinion: & that man to be guilty, which ſtanding at the bar of iuſtice, accuſed of ſome great crime, denyeth to be tryed by the verdict of his Country, according to the law: ſo likewiſe, the cauſe of Religion being called in queſtion, that muſt needs in any equall iudgement bee deemed vnſound and guilty, which will not ſtand to the verdict and ſentence of the Prophets and Apoſtles, who are the Iury to trye all caſes of conſcience: and of the Spirit of God ſpeaking in the Scripture, who is the onely Iudge to heare and determine all queſtions of doubt which may ariſe in matters of faith, and will be cenſured and iudged by none but it ſelfe.
               7. Againſt this truth, all the Romaniſts, and eſpecially the Ieſuites; and of the Ieſuites, chiefly Bellarmine, conflict and fight with foote and horſe, ſailes and oares, tooth and naile, and all they can doe: for herein lyeth the very bloud and life of their Religion. And if this bee wrung from them, that the Scripture is the onely iudge and rule of faith, Actum eſt de regno Pontificio, The Romiſh kingdome goeth to wracke vtterly: and therefore they mainely contend to proue, firſt, that the Scripture is not the Iudge of controuerſies; ſecondly, that it is not properly the rule of faith; and if it bee a Iudge, it is a dumbe one that cannot ſpeake, and if it be a Rule, it is a partiall and

imperfect one, not totall and abſolute.
               8. Theſe two poſitions Bellarmine laboureth to prooue byBell. de verbo Dei interp. li. 3. many ſorts of Arguments: firſt, from teſtimonies of the Olde Teſtament; ſecondly, from teſtimonies of the New; thirdly, by the authority of Biſhops and Emperours; fourthly, by the witneſſe of the Fathers; & laſtly by reaſon. I paſſe ouer the foure firſt ſorts of Arguments, as being ſufficiently anſwered by others, and come to the laſt, which are deriued from reaſon, the ſlightneſſe whereof doth plainely diſcouer the vanity of this their opinion. Now, to proue that the Scripture cannotBell. ibid. ca. 9. be the iudge of Controuerſies, nor the Interpreter of it ſelfe, they vſe three chiefe reaſons: firſt, becauſe it hath diuers ſenſes: ſecondly, becauſe it is not able to ſpeake, but is mute and dumbe; and thirdly, becauſe in euery well ordered Common-wealth, the Law and the Iudge are diſtinguiſhed; and therefore, ſeeing the Scripture is the law, therefore it cannot be the Iudge.
               9. I anſwere to the firſt, that it is not onely falſe, but impious to affirme, that the Scripture is as it were, A noſe of wax flexible into many ſenſes, as Melchior Canus affirmeth, or thatCan. loc. li. 3. c. 2. it may be dinerſly expounded according to the occaſion of the time, as Cardinall Cuſanus auerreth: or that it is like a Delphian
                  
                     Cuſ. ep. 2. 3. 7. Tur. contra Sad. pag. 99. 
                  Sword, to be conuerted into many ſenſes, as Turrian the Ieſuite maketh it: for as of one body there is but one ſoule, ſo of one place of Scripture, there is but one true & ſound ſenſe, which is the ſoule and life of it, the words being but the fleſh, and the skinne that couereth the ſame: and that true ſenſe is that which the Spirit of God intendeth, and not that which euery priuate ſpirit collecteth and deduceth out of the ſame: as for the Tropologicall, Anagogicall, and Allegoricall ſenſes, they are not diſtinct ſenſes of the Scripture, but diuers collections and applications iſſuing out of one and the ſame ſenſe: all which may bee intended by the Holy Ghoſt, vnder that one literall ſenſe. For example, when an Allegory is deduced out of a place of Scripture, as Saint Paul, Gal. 4. 24.Gal. 4. 24. doth allegorize that Hiſtory of Abrahams two Wiues, it is not a double interpretation of that Hiſtory: but it is onely

an Allegoricall application of it, to the illuſtrating of the matter which he had in hand: and ſo when by a tropologie a morall doctrine is deriued out of a text of Scripture, as our Sauiour doth, Math. 12. 41. 42. applying to the Iewes theMat. 12. 41. 42. repentance of the Niniuites, and the long iourney of the Queene of Saba to ſee, and heare Salomon; or when as by a type any thing in Scripture is myſtically expounded otherwiſe then the literall ſenſe doth beare: this is not a new ſenſe, but an accommodation of the right ſenſe to another purpoſe, which notwithſtanding is intended by the ſpirit of God: and this is confeſſed by diuers of their owne ſide. Cornelius Agrippa
                  
                     Agrip. de vanit. cap. 100. Aquin. Sum. pri. par. 9. pri. par. 10 thus writeth, The Scripture hath but one ſimple and conſtant ſenſe, in which alone, the truth is found. And Aquinas thus, It is the literall ſenſe which the author of the Scripture intendeth, which is God: yet it is not inconuenient, if in one letter of the Scripture, according to the literall ſenſe, there bee many ſenſes.
               
               10. But grant that there are diuers diſtinct ſenſes of ſome few places of Scripture: to wit, one literall, and another ſpirituall, (for in the moſt there is not) yet there can be but one literall ſenſe, as many of the Ieſuites themſelues confeſſe, and
                     Acoſt. lib. 3. de Cor. Reuel. ca. 11. Medina. Rib. com. in hoſ. ca. 11. nu. 6. 7. Bell. de verbo Dei, li. 3. ca. 3. Veg. de Juſt. li. 9 cap. 44. Sal. com. in Heb. diſ. 1. 7. Azor. Inſtit. mor. lib. 8. cap. 2. Sixt. Sen. Bibl. li. 3. pa. 140. Pol. Virg. de Inuent. li. 4. c. 9. from that onely, a forcible argument may be drawne, as Bellarmine acknowledgeth, and 
                     Ʋega another Ieſuite: except the myſticall ſenſe be explaned, and authorized by ſome other expreſſe place of Scripture, as Salmeron, Azorius, Sixtus Senenſis, and Polidore Ʋirgil auouch, and proue the ſame by the teſtimonie of Augustine and Ierome. Now then, why ſhould the multiplicity of ſenſes barre the Scripture, from being the Iudge of controuerſies, ſeeing no controuerſie can effectually be decided by any other ſenſe, but by the literall, which is euer one and the ſame: or by the myſticall, ſo farre forth as it is approued and declared by another Scripture, which then becomes the literall ſenſe of that place, wherein it is expounded, though it was ſpiritually included in the barke of the former from whence it was deriued? This therefore is a moſt vaine and friuolous obiection.
               11. To the ſecond, that the Scripture is dumb, and therefore

cannot bee the Iudge, becauſe the Iudge of controuerſies, muſt haue a deciding and determining voyce. I anſwere, that this is blaſphemy againſt the ſacred word of God: for if the Scripture bee an Epiſtle of the omnipotent God to his creature, as Gregory calleth it, what doth it but ſpeake to them toGregor. mag. Epiſt. 40. whom it is ſent? He that writes a letter to his friend, doth hee not ſpeake vnto him? and hee that reades his friends letter, doth hee not vnderſtand his meaning and intendment, becauſe the letter doth not vtter a voyce, and he heareth not his friend himſelfe? Doth not euery man know that there is a double word, verbum dictum, a word ſpoken, and verbum ſcriptum, a word written, the one being Imago cordis, the Image of the minde, the other Imago oris, the Image of the ſpeech? True it is, the Scripture doth not ſpeake, as man ſpeaketh, but yet it ſpeaketh as the Law vſeth to ſpeake: and God himſelfe ſpeaketh in the Scripture, to them that haue eares to heare him, and therefore in the Epiſtles to the Churches, which were all written, not ſpoken, it is ſaid, Let him
                  Reue. 2. & 3. 
                  that hath an eare, heare what the Spirit ſaith vnto the Churches; and is there any thing more common then theſe phraſes, what ſaith the Scripture? doth not the Scripture ſay? Yea, and is not the Scripture called vi
                        •
                     us Dei ſermo, the liuely word of God?
                  Heb. 4. 12. 
                  Heb. 4. 12. how can it ſpeake, if it bee dumbe; how can it giue life, if it be dead?
               12. This manifeſt truth Stapleton ſtriueth to elude by aStapl. lib. 1. cont. Whitak. c. 7. §. 9. witty, as he thinkes, but indeed a witleſſe diſtinction, God (ſaith he) ſpeaketh indeed by the Scripture, but hee ſpeaketh not vnto vs by them: the Scripture is indeed the word of God: but the Church is the voyce of God. Which fond obiection our famousWhitak. contra Staplet. Country-man the ſcourge of Poperie, Doctor Whitaker thus wipeth away. If God ſpeake in the Scripture, then hee doth it either with himſelfe, or vnto ſome other, but not with himſelfe, therefore to ſome other, and if to ſome other, to whom but vnto man? for hee neither ſpeaketh to Angels nor Deuils, nor dumb creatures, therefore onely to man, as when he ſaith, Thou ſhalt not kill, or, Loue your enemies: there is no man ſo ſimple, but hee perceiueth that God ſpeaketh vnto

man. And therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, that whatſoeuer things
                  Rom. 15. 4. 
                  are written aforetime, are written for our learning, that wee through patience and comfort of the Scriptures, might haue hope: And ſo it is cleare, that God by the Scripture, not onely ſpeaketh, but ſpeaketh vnto vs, and ſo the Scripture is not onely the word of God, but the voyce of God: in it ſelfe, as it proceeded from God, the voyce of God; to vs, as we haue it by writing, the word of God, and the Epiſtle of the great King, to his poore ſubiects, whereby they are enformed of his will and pleaſure, and directed in the wayes of ſaluation.
               13. I, but when the queſtion is about the ſenſe of a Text, as of that, Math. 16. 19. To thee will I giue the keyes, &c. WhichMath. 16. 19. words they interpret, as ſpoken to Peter onely, and conſequently to the Pope his ſucceſſour: we to the reſt of the Apoſtles, as well as to him. Where now doth the Scripture decide this doubt, and ſpeake plainely which is the trueſt ſenſe? Mary firſt, in the very place it ſelfe, by the due examination of the circumſtances thereof, they euidently ſhew that our ſenſe is the trueſt: for whereas the queſtion is propounded to all the Apoſtles, verſe 15. and all the Apoſtles held the ſame faith, that Ieſus is the Sonne of God, verſe 20. it muſt needes be, that Peter was but as the fore-man of the Queſt, and anſwered not for himſelfe only, but for them all: thereby ſhewing forth not any preeminence of authority aboue the reſt, but a greater zeale and forwardneſſe then the reſt. And herevpon it followeth, that ſeeing this promiſe of the keyes is made, becauſe of that faith and confeſſion, therefore they all beleeuing and confeſſing the ſame, haue an intereſt to the promiſe as well as Peter. And this Anſelmus in plaine tearmes affirmeth. It is to be noted (ſaith he) that this power was not giuen
                  Anſelm. in Mat. 16. 
                  alone to Peter: but as Peter anſwered one for all, ſo in Peter hee gaue this power to all.
               
               14. Secondly, by the conference of another place, which is more plaine, to wit, Ioh. 20. 23. where is a gift and an endowmentIoh. 20. 23. of that power of the keyes, which before was promiſed: for to binde, and to looſe, and to remit, and retayne ſinnes, is all one in effect, as Bellarmine himſelfe confeſſeth,

and contain
                     •
                   the whole vertue of the keyes: now here theyBell. de Rom. Pont. li. 1. ca. 12. are all inueſted with equall iuriſdiction, the Holy Ghoſt is equally breathed vpon them all, and equall authority be queathed vnto them all by theſe words of the Commiſſion, As my Father ſent me, ſo I ſend you: which expoſition is confirmed

Anſel. in Mat. 16 by the authority of moſt of the Fathers, as Auguſtine, Cyprian, Hierome, Theophilact, Anſelme, &c. and thus the Scripture by a moſt liuely voyce determineth this doubt: and as of this, ſo of all other queſtions and interpretations, the Scripture onely muſt bee the Iudge, which by ſearching the originals, examination of circumſtances, conference of other places, and conſulting with the learned Fathers and Expo
                     •
                  itors, together with feruent prayer to God for inward illumination, will giue a moſt exact, and preciſe ſatisfaction to all controuerſies, touching matters of 
                     •
                  aith, neceſſarie to bee beleeued.
               15. To the third reaſon, that the Scripture is the law, and therefore cannot be the Iudge: I anſwere, that though the Law and the Iudge be diuers diſtinct things, yet they are ſubordinate one vnto the other, and ſo may both ioyne in the concurrence of one cauſe: as when our Sauiour ſaith, Call no
                  Mat. 23. 9. 
                  man Father vpon earth, for there is but one, your Father which is in heauen: his meaning is not to exclude earthly Fathers from their title, but to ſhew that God is the primer and principall Father, both in reſpect of time, order, and cauſe, and that the other are but ſubordinate vnto him: ſo in a Common-wealth the Iudge is ſubordinate vnto the law, and the law is the Iudges Iudge: and for that cauſe, as the Law is ſaid to be a dumbe Magiſtrate, ſo the Magiſtrate is ſaid to be a ſpeaking Law: and ſo in truth the Law is the Iudge primarily, and principally, and the Magiſtrate is but the Miniſter of the law, and the Iudge ſubordinate. Now if this be ſo in a Common-wealth gouerned by humane Lawes, which are failing and imperfect in many things, being the ordinances of erring men, how much more may we deeme it to be ſo in the Church of God, whoſe Law-giuer is God himſelfe, and the law the word of God? and therefore, though the Paſtors

and Miniſters of the Church may interpret the Scriptures, yet they muſt be tyed to this rule, to doe it by the Scriptures, and to expound the law by the law: for ſhall not a temporall Iudge giue ſentence out of his owne braine, but ſecundum leges & ſtatuta, according to the lawes and ſtatutes of the Realme? And ſhall any Paſtour of the Church, be it the Pope himſelfe, giue iudgement in any queſtion out of his owne breſt, without the direction of Gods word? This is to preferre humane lawes before Gods law: and to make the ſtate of the Church farre inferiour to the ſtate politike: and to haue a more certaine rule for the deciding of ciuill controuerſies, then for the determining of queſtions of 
                     •
                  aith: ſo that in a word, the Scripture is both the law and the interpreter of the Law, the Iudge, and the Iudgement.
               16. Secondly, Bellarmine affirmeth and laboureth to proue
                     
                        ••
                     ll. de verbo Dei li. 4. ca. 12. that the proper and chiefe end of the Scripture was not to be the rule of faith, but that it might be commonitorium quoddam vtile, A certaine profitable commonitory, whereby the doctrine deliuered by word of mouth, might be conſerued and nouriſhed. And to this end and purpoſe, he vſeth diuers reaſons, as firſt, becauſe it containes in it many things which are not neceſſary to faith, as all the Hiſtories of the Olde Teſtament, and many of the New, and the ſalutations in the Epiſtles of the Apoſtles; all which were not therefore committed to writing, becauſe they were neceſſary to be beleeued, but are therefore neceſſarily beleeued, becauſe they are written. Secondly, becauſe all things neceſſary to be beleeued are not contained in the Scripture, as by what meanes women vnder the law were clenſed from originall ſinne, wanting circumciſion, and children that dyed before the eight day, and many Gentiles that were ſaued: againe, which are the books of Canonicall Scripture, and that theſe are Canonicall, and thoſe are not: that the Virgin Marie was a perpetuall virgin, that the Paſſeouer is to be kept vpon the Sunday being the Lords day, and that children of beleeuing Parents are to bee baptized, and ſuch like. Thirdly, becauſe the Scripture is not one continued body, as a rule ſhould bee, but containeth diuers workes, Hiſtories,

Sermons, Prophecies, Verſes, and Epiſtles. Theſe be his three reaſons, by which the Ieſuite would euince, that the Scripture is not giuen to this end, to be the rule of faith.
               17. To all which I will anſwere briefly, and diſtinctly, and firſt in generall, ſecondly in particular: In generall, if the Scripture be not giuen to be the rule of faith, why is it called Canonicall? It is therefore called Canonicall, becauſe it containes the Canon, that is, the rule of faith and life: this very inſcription approued by all, doth refute Bellarmines fond cauillation. Againe, if the Scripture was not giuen to bee the rule, but onely a monitorie, why were there ſo many Bookes written, ſeeing fewer would haue ſerued for monition? The multiplicity of Bookes proueth, that they ſerue not onely to put vs in mind of our duty, but alſo as an exact rule to ſquare our faith, and frame our life by. And laſtly, if the Scripture was not giuen to be a rule, why doth he himſelfe confeſſe afterward that it is indeed a rule, but not a total and entire rule, but a partiall and imperfect one? If it bee any waies a rule, then it was giuen by God, and written by the men of God, to that end to be the rule. And ſo Bellarmines goodly reaſons hang together like a ſicke mans dreame, the one part wherof ouerthroweth the other.
               18. But to anſwere in particular to them ſeuerally: To the firſt, I ſay, that it is not farre from blaſphemy to affirme, that there is any thing in holy Scripture that is vnneceſſary; for though all things are not of equall neceſſity and profit, yet there is nothing in the whole Booke of God, from the beginning of Gen. to the end of the Reuel. but may haue moſt profitable and neceſſary vſe in the Church of God, if not for the eſſentiall forme of faith, yet for the adorning and beautifying of it: and this may truely bee verified, euen of thoſe things which he excepteth againſt, to wit, the Hiſtories of the Olde and New Teſtament, and the ſalutations in the Epiſtles of the Apoſtles: out of all which, how many excellent doctrines may be deriued both for the confirmation of faith, and edification of manners! And therefore as in mans body, God by nature hath not diſpoſed all parts to be alike neceſſary, but

ſome haue no other vſe but ornament and comelineſſe: ſo hath Almighty God mingled the parts of holy Scripture in that manner, that ſome are as it were bones and ſinews to our faith, ſome fleſh and bloud, and ſome againe but exteriour beautie and faſhion: yet as in nature nothing is made in vaine, ſo much leſſe in Scripture is there any thing to be accounted ſuperfluous and redundant: nay, in this diuine body, there are no excrements that may be caſt out and ſeparated, as it fareth in our earthly carkaſes, but all is entire, ſound and perfect, as the Prophet Dauid teacheth, Pſal. 19. 7. when heePſal. 19. 7. ſaith, that the Law of God is perfect, conuerting the ſoule: and our Sauiour, Math. 5. 18. when he auoucheth, that till heauen
                  Math. 5. 18. 
                  and earth periſh one iote or title of the Law ſhall not, &c.
               
               19. To his ſecond reaſon I anſwere three things: firſt, that it is entirely falſe, that the Scripture doth not contayne all things neceſſarily required to the Eſſence of faith; for if the Scripture be perfect, and giueth wiſedome to the ſimple; if nothingPſal. 19. 7. Deut. 4. 2. Gal. 1. 8. may bee added to it, nor taken from it; if to teach any thing, beſides the Scripture, deſerueth the fearefull Anathema; if it be able to make the man of God perfect to euery good worke;
                  2. Tim. 3. 16. 17. Ioh. 5. 39. Epheſ. 2. 19. 20. Rom. 15. 4. if in them onely wee may finde eternall life; if the Church of God be built vpon the foundation of the Prophets, and Apostles: and laſtly, if our faith and hope doe ariſe from the Scriptures, then there is nothing neceſſary to ſaluation, but is fully and plenarily contained in them: but the firſt is true, as appeareth by all thoſe teſtimonies before alledged, and therefore the latter muſt by neceſſary conſequence be true alſo.
               20. Secondly, I anſwere, that Bellarmine by that aſſertion croſſeth the whole ſtreame of the Fathers, for moſt of them affirme the flat contrary. Tertullian ſaith, that when we once beleeue
                  Tertul. de praeſcript. 
                  the Goſpell: Hoc prius credimus non eſſe quod vltra credere debemus: This we beleeue firſt, that there is nothing beſides which we ought to beleeue. Iraeneus ſaith, that the Apostles committed
                  
                     Iraen

                  to writing the Gospell which they preached, Fundamentum & columnam fidei noſtrae futurum, To be the foundation, and pillar of our faith. Baſil ſaith, Quicquid extra diuinam ſcripturam
                  Baſil. Ethic. Reg. 80. 
                  eſt, cum ex fide non ſit, peccatum eſt, Whatſoeuer is beſide the holy
                  
                  Scripture, becauſe it is not of faith, is ſinne: Cyrill ſaith, that all
                  Cyril. in Ioh. lib. 12. cap. 68. 
                  thoſe things were written in holy Scripture, which the Writers thought ſufficient, Tam ad mores quàm ad dogmata, As well touching conuerſation, as doctrine. Augustine ſaith, that thoſe
                  Auguſt. in Iohan. tract. 49. 
                  things were choſen out to be written, Quae ſaluti credentium ſufficere videbantur, Which ſeemed ſufficient for the ſaluation of them that beleeue. And againe, he ſaith in another place, Whether
                  Aug. contr. lit. Petil. l. 4. c. 6. 
                  concerning Chriſt, or concerning the Church of Chriſt, or concerning any thing that pertaineth to our faith or life: we will not ſay if we, but if an Angell from heauen ſhall preach vnto you, but what ye haue receiued in the Scriptures of the Law, and the Goſpell, let him be accurſed. Chryſoſtome ſaith, Si quis eorum:

                  If any of them who are ſaid to haue the holy Ghoſt, doe ſpeake any thing of him ſelfe, and not out of the Goſpell, beleeue it not. Ierome ſpeaking of an opinion touching the death of Zacharias, the father of Iohn Baptiſt, ſaith, Hoc quia ex Scripturis non habet authoritatem, This, becauſe it hath not authority, out of the Scriptures is as eaſily contemned as approued. I ſuperſede for breuity ſake, the reſidue of the Fathers, who with full conſent conſpire in the ſame opinion: yea, not onely the Fathers, but many alſo of their owne moſt learned Authors: as Thomas Aquinas,

                  Antoninus, Durandus, Pereſius, Clingius, and diuers others: by all which we may ſee how little reckoning Bellarmine maketh of the ancient Fathers: where they make for him, hee magnifieth and exalteth them to the skies, but when they are oppoſite to him, he reiecteth them as droſſe, and the like account he maketh of his owne Doctors.
               21. Laſtly, I anſwere, that of thoſe things which he affirmeth, not to be contayned in holy Scripture, and yet to be of neceſſity of beliefe, ſome of them are farre from either neceſſity or profit, as that of the meanes whereby women vnder the Law were purged from originall ſinne: and how the Gentiles were partakers of the couenant, hauing not the Sacrament; and that Eaſter is to be celebrated vpon the Lords day: If theſe things be of that neceſſity of beliefe, which hee maketh them, how many thouſand then haue ſinned greatly, in being ignorant thereof? for at this day not the hundreth

part of Chriſtians euer heard theſe things once named, and yet by this ignorance they neither offended God, nor hindered their owne ſaluation. And what ſhall we thinke of Iraeneus,
                  
                     Euſeb. lib. 5. cap. 25. Sozom. lib. 7. cap. 19. and other godly Biſhops in the Eaſt, that held that Eaſter was not to bee celebrated euer vpon the Lords day? Againe, the other things nominated by him, as that the books of the ſacred Bible, are the Canonicall Scripture, and the word of the liuing God: that the children of beleeuing parents are to be baptized: that Chriſt deſcended into hell, may eaſily be proued out of Scripture, either by expreſſe teſtimonie, or by neceſſarie conſequence and deduction, which is all one; for, Perinde ſunt

               22. Thirdly, being driuen by the power of truth, to acknowledge the Scripture to be a rule, he commeth in with a leaden diſtinction: to wit, that is not a totall, but a partiall rule, and that the word of God written, and not written (by
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   this laſt meaning traditions) is the totall and perfect rule. To this I anſwere in a word, that by this diſtinction, he plainely ouerturneth that which before hee had confeſſed: for if it bee the rule of faith, then it muſt needes be totall and perfect, if it be not totall and perfect, then is it not the rule: for a rule muſt be proportioned to the thing, whereunto it is applied. If then our faith be either longer and larger then the Scripture, then cannot the Scripture bee any wayes called the rule thereof. Beſides, as Theophilact ſaith, Regula et amuſſis ne

                        que
                      ablationem: A rule doth neither admit addition nor diminution: and that is the definition of a rule according to Varinus. Regula eſt menſura quae non fallit, quae
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      nullam vel
                  Varinus. 
                  additionem vel detractionem admittit. A rule is (ſaith hee) a meaſure which deceiueth not, and which admitteth no addition nor detraction. Therefore if it be the rule of faith, either it is perfect, and abſolute, or none at all: if it ſtandeth in neede of traditions to ſupply it want, then why doth hee call it the rule, and why doe all the Fathers giue it the ſame name? and why hath it that inſcription in the forehead, the Canonicall Scripture? Laſtly, if God would giue vs a rule for our faith

and life in the Scripture, then by the ſame reaſon hee would make that a perfect rule: for, ſhall any imperfect thing proceede from the authour of all perfection? When an imperfect creature is borne, wanting either limmes or forme, we aſcribe it to a defect and errour in the particular nature, from whence the creature is deriued, or to the indiſpoſition of the inſtrumentall cauſes, not to the generall nature which tendeth alwaies vnto perfection. How much more then ought this Ieſuite be afraid to aſcribe an imperfect creature, to the all-perfect Creatour? eſpecially ſeeing it is the worke of his owne hands, without the intermingling of all ſecond cauſes, and proceedeth immediately from his owne ſpirit, the Prophets and Apoſtles, being but as Baruch to Ieremie, writers and engroſſers of that which the ſpirit did dictate vnto them? And therefore I may boldly and firmely conclude, that as the vncreated word of God, begotten of the Father before all time, is perfect God, and can neither receiue augmentation nor diminution: ſo the word of God, pronounced firſt by the mouth of the Prophets and Apoſtles, and after by them committed to writing▪ which is called the Scripture, is abſolute and perfect, and can neither be encreaſed nor diminiſhed, to make it more or leſſe perfect, and ſo is the onely true ſound and ſacred Rule, whereby both our Faith and life is to be directed towards the Kingdome of Heauen.
               23. And thus I hope, the firſt propoſition remaineth ſoundMINOR. and firme, notwithſtanding all that can be ſayd to the contrary. Now I come to the confirmation of the aſſumption or ſecond propoſition, which is, that the Religion of the Church of Rome refuſeth to be tryed and iudged by the Scriptures alone, and will be tried and iudged by none but it ſelfe: which if it be euicted, then the concluſion muſt neceſſarily follow, that therefore it is not onely to be ſuſpected, but vtterly reiected and abhorred.
               24. That this is ſo, though it hath already in the precedent diſcourſe beene ſufficiently demonſtrated, yet that the matter may appeare more plaine, and their impudency may be more notorious, let vs ſearch deeper into this wound, and diſcouer

the filthineſſe thereof from the very bottome: and firſt that they renounce the Scripture from being their Iudge, and then in the ſecond place, that they admit of no other Iudge but themſelues.
               25. Concerning the firſt, let vs heare Bellarmine the Achilles of Rome, ſpeake foremoſt, hee affirmeth in expreſſe words, that the Scripture is not the rule of faith, or if it be, that it is a partiall and imperfect rule, and vtterly inſufficient of it ſelfe, without the helpe of Eccleſiaſticall traditions. This aſſertion is well-neere the whole matter ſubiect of his third and fourthBell. de verbo Dei, li. 3. ca. 3. Bookes De verbo Dei, which he laboureth to ſtrengthen by all meanes poſſible: Yea, in the third Chapter of his third Booke, he ſaith peremptorily, that the Pope with a Councill is the Iudge of the true ſenſe of the Scripture, & all controuerſies. Now, in ſetting vp the Pope or a Councill into the ſupreme throne of Iudgement, he muſt needes pull downe the Scripture, & the Spirit of God ſpeaking therein from that throne, and deſpoyle it of that authority. But what need I draw this conſequence from his words, ſeeing throughout that whole Chapter he doth almoſt nothing elſe but ſtriue to proue that the Scripture is not the Iudge, & doth reproue the Proteſtāts for ſaying that all the iudgements of the Fathers, and all the decrees of Councils ought to be examined ad amuſſim Scripturarum, according to the rule of the Scriptures? Next vnto Bellarmine, commeth in Gregory de Ʋalentia, and hee moſtGreg. de Val. li. 5 in Anal. c. 2. & 3 boldly auoucheth, that the Scripture is not a ſufficient Iudge or rule of all controuerſies of faith: and that the Scripture alone defineth nothing at all, no not obſcurely of the chiefe queſtions of faith: and where it doth ſpeake, it ſpeaketh ſo obſcurely, that it
                  Hoſ. 10. 2. aduer. Brent. Proleg. 
                  doth not reſolue, but rather increaſe the doubt. Cardinall Hoſius is no whit leſſe audacious, when he affirmeth, that the Scripture in it ſelfe is not the true and expreſſe word of God, which we ought to obey, vnleſſe it bee expounded according to the ſenſe and
                  Sal. com. in. eſiſt. Paul. in Gen. Tur. contr. Sade. Coſt. Ench. de ſum. Pontif. 
                  conſent of the Catholike (that is in his opinion the Romane) Church. The Ieſuites Salmeron, Turrian, and Coſter, doe not onely barely affirme as much, but alſo confirme it by reaſon. The Scripture is dumbe (ſaith Salmeron) but the deciding voyce
                  
                  of a Iudge muſt be quicke. The Scripture is a dead letter (ſaith Turrian) and a thing without life (ſaith Coſter) but a Iudge muſt be liuing, who may correct ſuch as erre: therfore that Scripture cannot be the Iudge. It is as it were a Noſe of wax (ſaith Melchior Canus) flexible into euery ſenſe, and as it were, aCan. loc. li. 3. c. 2. Turri. vt ſupra. 
                  Delphian Sword, fit for all purpoſes (ſaith Turrian) therefore cannot be the Iudge. And therefore two other Ieſuites, to wit, Tanner and Gretzer impudently conclude, that no hereſie
                  Coll. Ratisb. 
                  can be ſufficiently refuted by Scripture alone, and that by no meanes it may be graunted, that either the holy Scripture, or the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaking by the Scripture, ſhould be the ſupreme and generall Iudge of Controuerſies: and hee addes his reaſon, becauſe the Scripture cannot dicere ſententiam, giue ſentence on one ſide, as a Iudge ſhould doe. Nay, one Vitus Miletus (as Pelargus reporteth) is not aſhamed to ſay, that weePelarg. Jeſuit. read, that an Aſſe ſpoke in the Scripture, but that the Scripture it ſelfe euer ſpoke, we neuer read. And thus this fellow makes the Scripture it ſelfe to be more mute then Balaams Aſſe, and the holy Spirit leſſe able to make that ſpeake, then an Angell was to make an Aſſe to ſpeake. Then which, what could be brayed out more like the beaſt he ſpeaketh of?
               26. But ſome may ſay, All theſe are but priuate mens opinions: we heare not all this while the determination of the Church. Let vs harken therefore to the voyce of the Church touching this poynt, that is, as they hold of the Councill, or rather Conuenticle of Romiſh Biſhops, aſſembled together at Trent, which they call the Church repreſentatiue. The ſecond Canon of the ſecond decree in thy fourth Seſſion of thatConc. Trid. ſeſ. 4. decret. 2. can. 2. Councill doth thus determine, Let no man truſting to his owne wiſedome, dare to interpret the Scripture after his owne priuate ſenſe, or contrary to that ſenſe which our holy Mother the Church holdeth, or contrary to the vnanimous conſent of the Fathers. The former part of this Canon is good and ſound; for Saint Peter ſaith, that no Scripture is of priuate interpretation:
                  2. Pet. 1. 20. and therefore they which wreſt the Scriptures to their owne ſenſes, contrary to the intent and ſcope of them, are guilty of a grieuous ſinne before God, and doe it to their owne deſtruction:

for Optimus ſcripturae lector eſt, qui dictorum intellectum non attulerit, ſed retulerit exſcriptura, (ſaith Hil.) that is, He
                  Hilar. de tri. l. 1. 
                  is the beſt reader of the Scripture, which doth not bring a ſenſe to the Scripture, but draweth it out of the Scripture. Beſides, the middle and end of the Canon is not to bee miſliked, if they haue a fauourable interpretation; for the iudgement of the Fathers is greatly to be regarded, and the authority of the Church is to be held in eſpeciall reuerence: but for all this, latet anguis in herba, vnder theſe faire pretences of words is couched a ſnake of foule errour: for firſt, they tye the gift of interpretation of Scripture, and of deciſion of controuerſies, to the Chaire of Peter ſeated at Rome, and poſſeſſed by the Pope, Peters ſucceſſour, as they call him, or to the Chaire of Biſhops aſſembled together in a Councill, as in Noahs Arke: whereas Saint Paul ſaith plainely, ſpeaking of the gift of interpretation, Theſe things workethone and the ſame Spirit, diſtributing to
                  1. Cor. 12. 11. 
                  euery man ſeuerally, as he will. And in another place, that the ſpirituall man diſcerneth all things, and therefore the Scriptures.1. Cor. 2. 15. Now, by the ſpirituall man, the Apoſtle meaneth the man regenerate and ſanctified by the Spirit, as it appeareth by that he oppoſeth him to the naturall man, in the verſe going before: and ſo the gift of diſcerning and interpreting is not proper to the Chaire of Biſhops.
               27. Secondly, this Canon doth not onely giue vnto the Church, thus conceiued of them, the onely gift of interpretation, but alſo a Praetorian and vnexaminable authority in interpreting; ſo that all which they deliuer out of their Chaires, muſt bee receiued peremptorily without examining the grounds and reaſons, for which they are mooued to be of that iudgement: which Tyrannicall vſurpation, is both contrary to the expreſſe precepts and principles of holy Scripture, and alſo to the doctrine and practice of all the ancient Fathers: for the ſcripture bids to try all things, & to hold that which is good.
                  1. Theſ. 5. 21. And Paul refuſed not to haue his doctrine examined of theActs 17. 11. men of Ber
                        •
                     a, by the Scripture: & the ſame Apoſt. directeth vs how to behaue our ſelues at the time of prophecying, namely,1. Cor. 14. 29. that two or three Prophets ſpeake, & the other iudge. All which

places are flatoppoſite to that peremptory obtruding of interpretations vpon the Church, which the Canon ſpeaketh of: &Aug. de doctrin. Chriſtian. Orig. hom. 17. in Exod. Hil. de trin. li. 4. Baſil de ſpir. Sa. cap. 1. Cyr. in Job. lib. 8. ſo are all the Fathers in generall; for in preſcribing certaine rules to all men, both of vnderſtanding and interpreting the Scriptures, they plainely ſhew that there is not this abſolute authority, nor infallibility in any, to obtrude what interpretation ſoeuer, without contradiction or examination.
               28. Laſtly, the Canon in giuing this indefinite power of interpretation, and determination of doubts to the Church, without any relation had to the Scripture, doth vtterly iuſtle out the Scripture from being the Iudge. And ſo Andradius the interpretour of this Councill doth expound the intendmentAndrad. thereof, when he ſaith, that the iudgement of the Church is, Principium vltra quod non ſit fas in inquiſitione progredi, Aprinciple, beyond the which it is not lawfull to proceede in inquiſition. By which he giueth to vnderſtand, that our faith muſt relye wholly and ſolely vpon the iudgement of the Church, that is, the Pope and his Prelates, without enquirie at all into the word of God, whether that which they propound be conſonant to the truth or no. As Eraſmus in a certaine diſputationEraſ. ex Chem. exam. pa. 66 againſt the Papiſts, confeſſeth, that their opinion hath not ſure & certain teſtimonies of Scripture, but that the contrary opinion may be better & more clerely & ſtrongly proued out of Gods word; notwithſtanding (ſaith he) if the Church bid, I will beleeue it, for I will captiuate my vnderſtanding to the obedience of the Church. And this indeed is the Babylonian ſeruitude of the church of Rome, wherby they fetter the ſouls of their followers to perpetual ſlauery, and lead thē blindfold vnder the veile of an implicite faith vnto perdition: for this is the firſt ground they lay in the hearts of all their generation, that they muſt not examine the doctrine of the Church, but take it at their hands as good coyne, though it be neuer ſo counterfeit, doctrina in Concilijs definit a cuſtodiēda eſt, non examinanda, (ſaithBell de verbo Dei, li. 3. c. 10. 
                  Bellarmine) that doctrine which is defined in a Council, is to be kept, not examined: and ordinarius paſtor Eccleſiae audiendus eſt, non iudicandus (ſaith Stapleton) an ordinary Paſtor ofStap de doctrina prin. li. 1. ca. 5. the Church is to be heard, not iudged: thus we ſee, that the

Scripture is thruſt cleane out of dores, from hauing any right or title in the deciſion of queſtions of faith: not onely by priuate men, but euen by their Church it ſelfe.
               29. Now here two things are to be obſerued of vs, for the plainer enucleation and clearing of this poynt: firſt, that in making the Scripture Iudge, we doe not exclude the Church, nor any member of the Church from the office of iudging and diſcerning, onely we place them in their due order and ranke: for this is it we intend, that the Scripture is the higheſt and moſt abſolute Iudge, from the ſentence whereof there is no appeale to be made to any higher Court: and that the iudgement & determination of the Church, or of any member therof, is ſubordinate vnto that, and to be ruled and guided by that, and where it is agreeable vnto that, there to be receiued, where it ſwarueth from that, to be reiected. For as in the ciuill eſtate, the Iudges deputed to that office, haue no abſolute authority in themſelues, but are ſubiect vnto the lawe, and the Miniſters thereof, and therefore muſt not ſpeake what they liſt, but what the law directeth: ſo in the ſtate Eccleſiaſticall, they that are inferiour Iudges, are but the Miniſters of the law of God, and muſt not vary from the rule thereof in any reſpect. And for this cauſe, as the Iewes were commandedDeut. 17. 10, 11 to obey the ſentence and determination of the Prieſt in all controuerſies, ſo the Prieſt was commanded to giue iudgement according to the law, and no otherwiſe: and albeit the Hebrew gloſſe vpon that Text teacheth, that if the Prieſt ſay that the right hand is the left, or the left is the right, his ſentence is to be holden, (which is the plaine doctrine of the Church of Rome, Iudaizing in this as in many other things) yet Lyra
                  
                     Lyra on Deu. 17 writing vpon that Text ſaith, that the gloſſe is manifeſtly falſe, becauſe the ſentence of no man, of what authority ſoeuer, is to be holden, if it be contrary to the law of God: ſo we admit the Church to be Iudge, and euery priuate Chriſtian alſo in his place, but we aſcribe the chiefe power and authority of Iudging to the Scripture alone. The next place we allow vnto the Church, and the loweſt vnto the particular members thereof: Theſe laſt to be directed by the Church, but yet ſo

farre as it bringeth it authority out of the Scriptures, and it to be limited by the bounds of the Scripture alſo: and if it iudge againſt the euidence thereof, not to bee heard nor beleeued. This is our opinion, that wee may not be miſtaken: but our aduerſaries aduance their Church vnto the higheſt place, and make the Scripture an inferiour vaſſall, and ſeruant vnto it, as I haue declared.
               30. Secondly, note thereaſon that moueth them, thus to diſclaime from the iudgement of the Scripture: it is becauſe they know full well, that the mayneſt and chiefeſt poynts of their Religion, wherein they diſſent from vs, haue no ground nor foundation in the Scripture, but would vaniſh like a morning auſt, if the light of Gods word ſhould but ſhine vpon them: as for inſtance, their doctrines of worſhipping Images, of taſting dayes, of prayer for the dead, of Purgatorie, of ſhrift, of pardons, of the communion in one kinde, of ſingle life, and of the priuate Maſſe, and ſuch like: all which poynts and many other, their owne Writers conteſſe, cannot be ſufficiently proued out of the Scripture. And therefore Andradius
                  Andrad. Orthod. explic. lib. 2. doth fully and ingenuouſly acknowledge, that many poynts of their Religion would reele and ſtagger, if they were not ſupported by tradition: and Bellarmine himſelfe ſaith, that it
                     Bel. de Euchar. lib. 3 cap. 23. How contrary is this to that of S. Auguſtine, out faith ſhuld reele and totter, if the authority of the Scriptureſtand not faſt, Aug. de doct. Chriſ. lib. 1. cap. 23. may be doubted whether the great poynt of tranſubstantiation may be ſufficiently enforced out of the words of the Text, Hoc eſt corpus meum: So that wee ſee now the reaſon why they will not be tried by the Scriptures, euen this, becauſe if the Scripture bee Iudge, Popery muſt needes goe to wracke. This is ther fore a cunning and witty policie, or rather a groſſe and palpable ſubtilty of theirs, whereby though they dazle the ſight of the ſimple and ignorant, yet they cannot bleare the eyes of the vnderſtanding and wiſe, from diſcerning into their fraud.
               31. Hauing thus proued, that they reiect the Scripture, now I come to ſhew, that they allow of no other Iudges but themſelues: for the proofe whereof, there needes no long diſcourſe, ſeeing it is ſufficiently apparent, by that which hath already beene deliuered, that they appeale from the ſentence

of the Scripture vnto the iudgement of the Church, and tye vnto the girdle thereof, the onely key of interpretation. Now by the Church, they intend firſt the Romiſh Synagogue, that is, all that whole bony which dependeth vpon the Pope for their head, and receiue as it were life, and nouriſhment by his influence: for (as Bristo ſaith) the Romane
                  Briſto mot. 12. in marg. Rhem. Annot. in Rom. 
                  Church is the Catholike Church, and as the Rhemiſts, the Catholike and the Roman faith is all one. Secondly, by the Church, they meane more particularly a congregation of Romiſh Biſhops and Prelates aſſembled together in a Councill, which they call the Church repreſentatiue. And thirdly and principally,Aquin. 22. q. 11. art. Greg. de Valent. Anal. fid. p. 136. they intend by the Church, the Pope, who is the head of the Church, and contayneth in him virtually all the power and authority of the Church. The Church in the firſt ſenſe, is not to be this Iudge (ſay they) nor yet in the ſecond: which notwithſtanding, is but an vpſtart opinion, and but of the firſtConcil. Conſtant. Seſ. 4. 5. Baſilſeſſ. 2. head: for in the Councils of Constance and Baſil, it was decreed, that the Pope ſhould obey the Councill, and be ordered by it in all things pertayning to faith, and the reformation of the 
                     〈…〉
                  : and many learned Romaniſts haue been of the ſame opinion, as Bellarmine confeſſeth: but now neitherBell. de concil. li. 2. cap. 14. may the Councill be Iudge: therefore take the Church in the third ſenſe for the Pope, and then you haue the man that is the Church virtuall, and muſt be all in all, euen the only Iudge and Vmpier in all controuerſies. The center in which all the lines, that is, opinions of Fathers, Councils, and Diuines muſt concurre and meete. The Epitome and abridgement of the whole Church, in whom alone remayneth the
                  Silu. ſum. verb. ſides nu. 2. 
                  whole power of the Catholike Church. And thus from the Scripture, they call vs to the Church, from the Church to the Councils, and from them to the Pope, and there they pitch their line, as in the higheſt poynt of reſolution.
               32. That they thus vnderſtand by the Church, the Pope, and that all iudgement is deuolued vnto him alone, heare them ſpeake in their owne perſons. Bellarmine ſaith, that the Pope without a Councill may define matters of faith, becauſe being
                  Bell. de Chriſto li. 2. cap. 28. 
                  the vniuerſall▪ Pastor, and Teacher of the Church, he cannot
                  
                  erre, teaching out of the chaire: and that he is abſolutely aboueIdem de concil. lib. 2. cap. 17. Idem cap. 18. the Councill, and that he may, as he is the chiefe Prince of the Church, retract the iudgement of the Councill, and not follow the greater part. And therefore, when hee affirmeth in another place, that the Pope with a Councill, is the Iudge ofIdem de Verbo Dei, li. 3. ca. 3. the true ſenſe of the Scripture; he foyſteth in the word Councill for a flouriſh, but indeede, hee meaneth the Pope alone: for if the Pope be aboue all Councils, and may eſtabliſh or diſanull their decrees at his pleaſure, then is not hee with a Councill, but without a Councill the chiefe Iudge.

               34. Thus we ſee, the Pope is that which they meane by the Church: and he is the onely compendious Iudge: and therefore

when they talke of the Church, it is but a vayne vaunt; for when all comes to all, they entend nothing by the Church, but their Lord God the Pope, as the Canoniſts call him: who is ens ſecundae intentionis compofitum ex Deo & homine,

Now by this that hath beene ſaid, the truth of my ſecond propoſition doth euidently appeare; to wit, that the Romaniſts will allow no other Iudges in matter of controuerſie, but themſelues alone, and ſo giue iuſt cauſe to all that are not blinded with errour, at leaſt to ſuſpect their Religion, if not vtterly to abandon it, which is the concluſion neceſſarily following vpon theſe premiſes.
               35. Which, that it is of moſt neceſſarie conſequence, appeareth by this, becauſe it is againſt all reaſon, that the ſame ſhould be both the party and the Iudge: yea, in equity is it fit, that we ſhould ſtand to his iudgement, whom we accuſe to be a falſifier of the Scripture, and euen Antichriſt himſelfe? or that that Church ſhould bee our Church, which wee affirme and proue to be an Apoſtate, and an harlot? ſeeing that a Iudge ſhould be indifferent and vnpartiall, and not a party: as the Church and Pope of Rome is in all caſes of controuerſie depending betwixt them and vs; as for example in the controuerſie of the Church, the queſtion being which is the true Church. The Iudge to determine thereof, we ſay, is the Scripture: they cry, The Church, meaning their owne Church, as I haue ſhewed. Doe they not by their doctrine aduance themſelues into the tribunall ſeate, and make their Church the Iudge, whether it bee the Church or no? ſo in the queſtion touching the Popes Supremacy, who ſhall be Iudge whether this ſupreme power be in the Pope or no? Mary the Pope himſelfe, for they admit no other Iudge. Sure he muſt needes gaine the cauſe, when hee is thus his owne Iudge. If this bee not a plaine terg

                  36. For as on ourſide in the queſtion of the Kings Supremacie, whether euery King in his owne dominion bee the ſupreme Gouernour of the Church vnder Chriſt or no: if wee ſhould in this caſe admit no Iudge, but the King himſelfe: Or in the queſtion of our Church, whether wee be the true Church of Chriſt or no: if wee ſhould refuſe all other triall, ſaue that which ariſeth from the iudgement of our owne Church, and the Biſhops and Prelates thereof; would not all men laugh at our folly, and thinke our cauſe weake and deſperate? So may all men thinke of the Romiſh Religion, that it be wrayeth manifeſt folly in the maintayners, and apparent weakeneſſe in the grounds thereof, in that it will not bee iudged but by itſelfe, eſpecially ſeeing it is the property of ſelfeloue, whereof no man liuing is freed, to make men blinde in their owne cauſes, and partiall on their owne ſides. To conclude therefore, as the Lion in Eſope, that challenged to himſelfe the whole prey that was caught, and would not ſtand to the equall partition of his fellow-hunters, proued himſelfe thereby to be a tyrant, and his title naught: ſo the Pope of Rome, and his Proctours, in refuſing to be iudged by any ſaue themſelues, and by that right clayming a title to the truth, diſcouereth both his tyrannie ouer the Church of God, and the holy Scriptures, and the badneſſe of his weake cauſe; ſeeing truth like a chaſte matrone, though it be ſlandered, yet is ſo bold and powerfull, that it feareth not to bee tried by thoſe that are the greateſt enemies thereof.

                  MOTIVE. VI. That Religion doth iuſtly deſerue to bee ſuſpected, which doth purpoſely diſgrace the ſacred Scriptures: But ſuch is the Religion of the Church of Rome: Ergo, &c.
               OVr Aduerſaries may fitly be likened to churliſh and angrie Maſtifes, whoſe property it is to rend with their teeth thoſe that are vnarmed, and not able to reſiſt: but if they meet with an armed man, that can keepe them off and

entertaine them with ſharpe blowes, then they wreak all their teene vpon the cudgell or weapon wherewith they are annoyed: ſo they ſeeing themſelues well banged and beaten by our men at Armes, I meane, our Champions that defend the quarrell of our Church, with the ſtaffe of the Scripture, and their hairy ſcalpes wounded with the ſtones fetcht out of Dauids ſcrip, fall a ſnarling and biting the ſtaffe, and the ſtones which haue beene the inſtruments of their ſorrow; whereas if they finde any without a ſtaffe in his hand, or a ſtone in his ſling, that is vnfurniſhed with Scripture to fight with them, ouer him they domineere, & take him captiue, and leade him to their denne for a prey. This their malice againſt the ſacred Scripture, which is the only engine of their deſtruction, I hope by Gods fauourable aſſiſtance ſo to diſcouer in this Chapter, that they themſelues ſhall euer bee reputed as blaſphemers of the truth, and their religion as odious and abominable to all poſterity.
               2. The Maior or firſt propoſition in this demonſtration,MAIOR. though it bee of an vndoubted truth, yet for the greater illuſtratio: thereof, two poynts are to be conſidered: firſt, what this Scripture is, which is oppoſed againſt: and ſecondly, what they are to be eſteemed which oppoſe themſelues vnto the Scripture. The Scripture contained in the Olde and new Teſtament, is, in a word, the holy and ſacred word of the eternall God: which to haue ſaid of it, is an aſcription of the greateſt dignitie vnto it, as can bee deuiſed: for if it bee the holy and ſacred word of the eternall God, then muſt it needs be perfect. excellent, pure, vpright, cleane, permanent, wife, ſweet, and what elſe may be ſpoken for the ſetting forth of the excellency of a thing: all which attributes are giuen vnto it by the Prophet Dauid, in the 19. Pſalme, and doe neceſſarilyPſal. 19. appertaine vnto it, being immediately deriued from that cleare and ſole fountaine of all goodneſſe and perfection: For howſoeuer the holy Prophets were the penne-men thereof; yet thoſe were all and in euery parcell and particle inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt, as Saint Peter informeth vs, when hee ſaid, That no Prophecie in the Scripture is of any priuate
                  2. Pet. 1. 20. 21. 
                  motion, but that holy men of God ſpake as they were mooued
                  
                  by the holy Ghoſt. For as the heathen Oracles were conceiued, and vttered by the immediate inſtigation of the Deuill, who guided both the hearts and tongues of his Prieſts, to bee the inſtruments of his malice: So the Oracles of Chriſtians, to wit, the holy Scriptures, proceeded from the ſacred inſpiration of Gods Spirit, mouing the hearts, and directing the pens of the Prophets & Apoſtles his Secretaries, to commit to writing that only which they receiued from God, both in reſpect of matter and manner. To this purpoſe is that notable ſaying of Hugo, In the holy Scripture, whatſoeuer is taught, is truth:
                  Hugo de anima. 
                  whatſoeuer is commanded, is goodneſſe: whatſoeuer is promiſed, is happineſſe: And he addes the reaſon; Becauſe God is truth, without deceit; goodneſſe, without malice; and happineſſe, without miſery.
               
               3. I need not ſtand to prooue this poſition, That the Scripture is the infallible word of the eternall God: it is a grounded truth, and a receiued principle of all that profeſſe themſelues to be Chriſtians. And as Saint Baſil ſaith, Like as of eueryBaſil in Pſa. 115 Science there are 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , vnqueſtionable Principles which are beleeued without further demonſtration: ſo in the Science of Sciences, Theologie. This is one of thoſe vnqueſtionable principles, that the Scripture is the word of God, and therefore of diuine both purity and authority. Adde hereunto, that if any ſhould doubt thereof, the purity and perfection of the matter, the maieſtie and the ſtatelineſſe of the ſtile, the power and efficacy ouer the conſcience, the certaintie of Propheſies fulfilled in the dueneſſe of time, the ſtrangeneſſe of the miracles, the antiquity of the writings before all other, the admirable prouidence of God in preſeruing them from the teeth of time, and rage of Tyrants, the ſweet harmony & conſent of euery part with each other, the iudgements of God againſt the contemners therof, and laſtly, the bloud of ſo many thouſand Martyrs which hath beene ſhed in the defence thereof, doe ſufficiently conuince and proue, that this Booke is the Booke of GOD, and euery line and title therein, the Word of God.
               4. This being ſo, then ſecondly it muſt needs follow, that

either to denie the Scripture to bee the Word of God, or to abuſe it with vnreuerent termes and reproches, or any wayes to diminiſh the credit and authority thereof, is not onely plaine blaſphemy, but alſo open and notorious Atheifme; and ſo in both high treaſon againſt the Maieſtie of God: for, if it be treaſon to vſe contumelious ſpeeches againſt the Kings perſon, or either by word to reuile, or by deede to reſiſt his decrees and proclamations: how much more doth that deſerue the name of the higheſt treaſon, when the ſacred word of God, which is a diuine Law, iſſuing from his owne mouth, is blaſphemed, and the maieſtie of God moſt clearely ſhining, therein abuſed? It is an olde and a true ſaying in ciuility, Qui contemnit legem, contemnit Regem: He that deſpiſeth the Law, despiſeth the law-giuer. So much more then in Diuinitie, hee that reprocheth the word of God, reprocheth God himſelfe. How can they then bee leſſe than Atheiſts, Blaſphemours, and Traytours to God, that are guilty of all this iniurie to the holy Scripture?
               5. Celſus, againſt whom Origen wrote, and Lucian, and Porphery, and Apelles, were Whelpes of this Litter; and therefore remaine to this day branded with the note of infamy: to theſe ſucceeded many others in after-ages (for the world hath neuer beene without ſuch monſters, God permitting them for the further demonſtration of his truth, and declaration of his iuſt iudgement in their deſerued and ſtrange deſtruction:) yea, that which is moſt ſtrange, many of thoſe that haue vaunted themſelues for Chriſts Vicars here on earth, haue beene taynted with this infection, as Pope Leo the tenth, who (as Writers report) mocked at the promiſes and threats of theBalaeus. Scripture, and told Cardinall Bembus, that that fable of Chriſt had brought vnto him and his, great profit. Such another was Iohn the twelfth, who vſed to blaſpheme God, and call vpon

                   the deuill at his dice: and Iulius the third, who asked why he ſhould not bee as angry for the eating of a colde Peacock, as God was for the eating of an Apple? And Benedict the eight, alias the ninth, whoſe cuſtome was in Woods and Mountaines, to ſacrifice to the deuill: and diuers others, which for

breuity ſake I forbeare to name. Is it poſſible that ſuch Athieſts, and blaſphemous wretches, and worſhippers of deuils, ſhould be choſen of Chriſt to be his Vicars here on earth, to whom hee might commit the gouernment of his Church? Will a mortall man commit the gouernment of his family, eſpecially if he loueth his wife and children, to a knowne Ruffin and a notorious villaiue? Now Chriſt ſo loueth his family, his Church, that to purchaſe and redeeme it, hee gaue his owne pretious bloud, for a ranſome for it: and will hee now ordaine in his roome ſuch notorious Wolues, to bee the miniſteriall heads and guides thereof? As for the reſt of the Popiſh crue, both learned and vnlearned, though they bee, as I muſt needes confeſſe, for the moſt part, more infected with ſuperſtition, then with Atheiſme, (albeit neuer did any Country more ſwarme with that generation, then doth Italy at this day) yet in blaſpheming and debaſing the holy Scripture, they cannot be farre from, not onely giuing-way, and opening a wide dore to that horrible ſinne, but alſo from making an open profeſſion thereof.
               6. Thus we ſee both what the Scripture is, and alſo what they are that oppoſe againſt the Scripture: which two conſiderations ſerue much for the clearing of the firſt propoſition. Now I come to the confirmation of the aſſumption or ſecondMINOR. propoſition, which euery Romaniſt will denie in this argument, and therefore ſtands in neede of ſtronger fortification: the propoſition is this, that the Religion of the Church of Rome doth purpoſely diſgrace the holy Scriptures, and is at enmity with it: that is, that both by doctrine, practice, and bitter and blaſphemous ſpeeches, the holy Scripture is diſgraced, defaced, and vilely ſlandered by the chiefe profeſſours and maintayners of that Religion, yea, and by the grounds of the Religion it ſelfe. I will begin with their doctrine, and ſecondly come to their practice, and in the laſt place their ſlanderous and bitter ſpeeches ſhall be diſcouered.
               7. Amongſt many of their doctrines, whereby they offer open iniurie and wrong to the ſacred Scriptures, theſe foure are the moſt principall: Firſt, that which hath beene at large

diſcourſed in the former Chapter, touching the chiefe Iudge of controuerſies: for, when as they diſable the Scripture from that office, and exalt the Church, that is, the Pope, as I haue ſhewed, into the higheſt throne of iudgement, what doe they elſe but debaſe the Scripture, in ſubiecting it to the Popes wil, and making it a vaſſall to wayt vpon his pleaſure, and giuing a greater certainty and infallibility to the determinations of his mouth, ſpeaking out of his chayre, then vnto the infallible and certaine light of truth, ſhining in the Scriptures? This is open wrong to the Scriptures, and not onely to it, but alſo to the Spirit of God, the Author and Enditer thereof; for, they which ſet vp the Pope as an all-ſufficient and moſt competent Iudge, and pull downe the Scripture as non-ſufficient and incompetent, as the Romaniſts doe, doe they not aduance the one, and diſgrace the other? as on the contrary, we which aſcribe all con
                     •
                  petencie of right, and ſufficiencie of power to the Scripture, and denie the ſame to the Pope, doe we not diſgrace him, and aduance it? This is the difference in this poynt betwixt them and vs, and their Religion and ours: and that men may ſee how little eſtimation they haue of the Scripture compared with their Pope, though the Pope be a man vtterly vnlettered, & ignorant euen of the grounds of Grammar, much more of the grounds of Diuinitie, as ſome
                     Baron. Glaber. Rodulph. Spondan. Annal. Eccl. ſ. an. 1033. Balaeus.
                   of them were: though he be a childe of tenne yeeres of age, as Bennet the ninth, or a mad Lad not paſt eighteene yeeres old, as Iohn the twelfth; though he be an Atheiſt, as was Leo the tenth, or a Coniurer, as Iulius the third: Laſtly, though hee were a man deſtayned with all manner of filthy and lewd conuerſation, as a number of them were: yet his iudgement
                     If quatenus home, he goe to hell, what will his quatenus Papa doe him good? Baldus.
                   muſt bee heard and preferred, becauſe (forſooth) quatenus Papa, as he is Pope, he cannot erre, though quatenus homo, as he is a man, hee be an Heretike, or an Atheiſt, or a wicked wretch: or becauſe Papa est doctor vtriuſ
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      legis authoritate, non ſcientia. The Pope is Doctour of both lawes in authority, and not in knowledge: And thus by their Religion, the holy and ſacred Scripture muſt giue place, and bow the knee to an vnholy, ſacrilegious, and ignorant Pope oftentimes, and acknowledge

him as Iudge, and ſubmit it ſelfe to his ſentence and cenſure.
               8. The ſecond doctrine of theirs, whereby they diſgrace and wrong the Scripture, is that touching the inſufficiency and imperfection thereof: for they are not aſhamed to ſay that the Scripture is imperfect and vnſufficient of it ſelfe, and that in it are not contained all things needfull to ſaluation, but that a great part. yea, the greateſt part of true Religion, is grounded vpon tradition, without the which the Church of GOD could not bee ſufficiently inſtructed, either in faith or manners: this is their goodly doctrine: whereas we on the other ſide hold and maintaine, that the Canonicall Scripture containeth in it ſufficiently, plainely, and abundantly all doctrines neceſſary to be knowne, for the attainment of ſaluation,

                   whether they be poſitions of faith, or directions for godlineſſe: and that thereis no neede of any vnwritten traditions, for the ſuppliance of any want or defect which is found therein. And herein we haue not onely all the ancient Fathers of the primitiue and purer times of the Church our Abbetters, as Iraeneus, Origen, Athanaſius, Baſil, Chryſoſtome, Cyril, Tertullian, Cyprian, Auguſtine, Hierome, as you may ſee in the places quoted in the Margent: but alſo the teſtimony of the Holy Ghoſt in the Scriptures, plainely and directly affirming the ſame.
               9. That this imputation of imperfection and inſufficiency is layd by them vpon the Scripture, let vs heare themſelues acting their owne parts: and firſt Bellarmine the Ringleader. He in his fourth Booke De verbo Dei, and fourth Chapter, ſets downe this poſition, that the Scriptures without traditions are not ſimply neceſſary nor ſufficient: and throughout that whole Chapter doth nothing elſe but labour to prooue the ſame by many arguments and reaſons, as if hee were not content barely to affirme ſo high a blaſphemy, but euen (as the Poet ſayth) Cum ratione inſanire, To be madde with reaſon: and ſo are all his reaſons there vſed, in very deed mad reaſons, which my purpoſe is not to ſpend time in confuting, (that being ſufficiently performed by our great and learned Champions of

the truth, which as yet remaine vnanſwered: onely it is inough for my intent to diſcouer to all men his notable blaſphemy againſt the holy Scriptures, which not onely in that place, but in many other, euidently and impudently ſheweth it ſelfe.
               10. Next vnto him comes in another great Ieſuite, Gregorie
                  Greg. de Valent. Anal. fid. l. 8. c. 6 
                  de Ʋalentia, and he playeth his part, and ſayth, That the moſt fitteſt way of deliuering the doctrine of faith to the Church, was this, not that all ſhould bee committed to writing, but that ſome things ſhould be deliuered viua voce, that is, by tradition. But Cardinall Hoſius more plainly and boldly affirmeth, That
                  Hoſius confeſſ. Petric. ca. 92. 
                  the greateſt part of the Goſpell is come to vs by tradition, and that very title of it is committed to writing: Yea, it is reported of him, that he ſhould ſay, Melius actum fuiſſe cum Eccleſia, ſi nullum extaret ſcriptum Euangelium, That it had beene better for the Church, if there were no written Goſpell extant. O blaſphemy! and yet wiſely ſpoken, if ſo be by the Church, hee meaneth the Church of Rome, as without doubt hee doth. But let vs heare another of the ſame ſtampe Eckius, I meaneEckius Enchir. cap. 4. that peremptory Bragadochio, he ſteps forth, and ſhoots his bolt in a moment, The Lutherans are dolts (ſayth hee) which will haue nothing beleeued but that which is expreſſe Scripture, or can be prooued out of Scripture: for all things are not deliuered manifestly in the Scriptures, but very many are left to the determination of the Church. Coster another Stage-player of theirsCoſt. Ench. ca. 1. comes in, and diuides the word into three parts, to wit, That which God himſelfe writ, as the tables of the Law; that which he commanded others to write, as the Olde and the New Testament; and that which he neither writ himſelfe, nor rehearſed to others, but left it to themſelues as traditions, the decrees of Popes, and Councils. And then he concludeth blaſphemouſly, that many things of faith are wanting in the two former, neither would Christ haue his Church depend vpon them, but this latter is the beſt ſcripture, the Iudge of controuerſies, the Expoſitor of the Bible, and that whereupon we muſt wholly depend. His words are theſe, Omnia fidei mysteria, ccaeera

What can be more plaine? Yet Lindanus is more plaine, for he calleth Traditionem non ſcriptam, &c. The vnwritten

To conclude all in one ſumme, without any further repetition of priuate mens opinions, wherein much time might be ſpent, the voyce of their whole Church repreſented in the Councill of Trent, is this, That traditions are to bee receaued,

Thus wee haue a view of the doctrine of the Church of Rome, touching the inſufficiency of the holy Scripture, both in part and whole. Out of all which, theſe two impious concluſions doe neceſſarily ariſe: Firſt, that traditions vnwritten are equall, if not ſuperiour in dignity and authority to the written word of God: and ſecondly, that without the helpe of them, it is not able to bring vs either to a ſauing faith in this life, or to the end of our faith in the life to come: then both which, what could be ſpoken more iniurious either to the Word it ſelf, or to the Maieſtie of that Spirit, from whom it proceeded? And that their blaſphemy might be known

                  o all men, Bellarmine, more like a IulianBel. deverbo Dei, l. 4. c. 4. then a Chriſtian, doth not onely affirme the Scripture to be vnſufficient and imperfect, but alſo not ſimply neceſſary, and to that end he maketh a good round diſcourſe, and bringeth in long Leaden arguments, which indeed are not worth the anſwering, for they are meere ſophiſticall colluſions, as any one of meane iudgement may eaſily diſcerne. Neuertheleſſe, by this we may ſee, what an honourable opinion and affection

theſe fellowes beare towards the Scripture, when as they dare to affirme that they are not ſimply neceſſary, but may bee wanting and remoued without any great hurt to the Church of God.
               12. The third iniurious doctrine, whereby open diſgrace3. is offered to the holy Scripture, is concerning the authority thereof, compared with the Church: for this they teach and hold, That the authority of the Scripture doth depend vpon the Church, and not the Church vpon the Scripture. And ſo by conſequent, that the Scripture is inferiour to the Church, and not the Church to the Scripture: whereas we on the contrary affirme and defend, that the Church wholly dependeth both for authoritie and exiſtency vpon the Scripture, and ſo is euery way inferiour to the Scripture, and not the Scripture vpon the Church.
               13. This blaſphemie of theirs may more euidently be diſcerned, if we obſerue what they vnderſtand by the Church, to wit, not the Primitiue Church, which was in the time and immediately

This is their Church: and to this Church of theirs they ſubiect the Scriptures, euen the word of God to the Pope of Rome, that is, God himſelfe to a mortall ſinnefull man. For as Nil

Againe, in another place he concludeth, That the Scriptures doe depend vpon

And yet elſewhere he diſclaimethIdem de concil. author. li. 2. c. 12. this opinion as none of theirs, and calleth it a blaſphemy: that it is his, I haue ſhewed already, though he be aſhamed of it as he may well be, and therefore exore ſuo, by his owne iudgement, he, and all the reſt are guilty of moſt groſſe and intolerable blaſphemie.

               16. The fourth and laſt doctrine whereby they offer iniurie4. to the Scripture, is this, That the Pope may diſpenſe with the Law of God. This the Popes vaſſals do not onely affirme,

                   but euen confirme and auouch. For thus they teach, Poteſtas in diuinas leges ordinariè in Romano Pontifice reſidet, Power ouer the lawes of God remaineth ordinarily in the Pope of Rome: and that the Pope may diſpenſe againſt the Apoſtles, yea, againſt the new Teſtament vpon great cauſe, and alſo againſt all the precepts of the olde Teſtament. The reaſon whereby they confirme this braue doctrine, is this, that where the reaſon of the law faileth,

there the Pope may diſpenſe, but the reaſon of the law always faileth, where he iudgeth it to faile, (for ſpeaking definitiuely, he cannot erre) therefore the Pope may diſpenſe with the precepts of the Olde & New Teſtament, where, and when he liſt. Now, what can be more iniurious to the Scripture then this? for firſt, they ſet the Pope aboue the ſcriptures, becauſe he that taketh vpon him to diſpenſe with the law of another, challengeth to himſelfe a greater authority then the other, according as their owne rule is, In praecepto ſuperioris non debet diſpenſare

                  inferior, The inferiour may not diſpenſe with the commandement of the ſuperiour. Secondly, they equall him to God himſelfe, for whereas there is no exception nor exemption from the law of God: but this Niſi deus aliter voluerit, Except God otherwiſe appoynt, they inſtead thereof put in this exception, Niſi Papa aliter voluerit. And laſtly, they make the law of God a maimed & an imperfect law, in that (as their diuinity is) it cannot giue ſufficient direction to mans life, for practice of duties and auoyding of ſinnes, in all caſes, without the Poprs diſpenſation, and the interpoſition of his ſuperwiſe authority.

                  t vs come to their malicious practice againſt the Scripture, that both by their precepts and practice, their enmity to the Scriptures may fully appeare. Firſt therefore, whereas the language wherein the Scriptures were originally written, is indeed the true Scriptures, becauſe that is the immediate dialect of the holy Ghoſt, and the tranſlations of it into other tongues, are no farther to bee regarded then as they agree with the originall; yet the Church of Rome, in the Councill of Trent, hath canonizedConc.

This is true in all naturall, good, and true things, but much more in this ſupernaturall good, and truth, which as Origen

               20. And yet theſe preſumptuous Romaniſts forbid the reading of the Scripture among the people; one of them affirming, That it was the deuils inuention to permit the people to reade the Bible: Another, That he knew certaine men to be poſſeſſed of the deuill, becauſe being but Husband-men, they were able to diſcourſe of the Scriptures: All teaching, that it is the ground of Hereſie, and that Lay men are no better then Hogs and Dogs: and therefore theſe precious pearles not to be committed vnto them, and that the Scripture to a Lay man is as a ſword in a mad mans, or a knife in a Childes hand. Thus they practiſe to impriſon the Scriptures within the Prieſts cells, or Monkes cloyſters, which were giuen by God, to be the light of the world: and yet (which is to be noted) in Queene Maries bloudy and blinde daies, ſuch as could diſpend a certaine ſumme of mony by the yeare, might reade the Bible, without any ſpeciall diſpenſation; as if hereſie builded

her neſt rather in the breſt of the poore man, then of the rich, or, as if the rich were leſſe carnall then the poore: and thus theſe ſaucy fellowes handle the ſacred Scripture at their pleaſure, being rightly to be branded with the name of Heretikes, whom Epiphanius generally calleth Lucifugae, becauſe they cannot abide the light of the Scriptures, but fly from them as Owles and Bats from the light.
               21. Another practice of theirs is againſt the ſenſe of the Scripture, as the two former were againſt the letter, that neither the body nor the ſoule thereof might be left vnuiolated: and this is in reſpect of the learned, to bar them vp from controuling their errours, as the other were in reſpect of the ſimple, to keepe them from once looking into them. Their policy in this, is to interdict all ſenſes and expoſitions of the Scripture, ſaue ſuch as agree with the Church of Rome, and are allowed by the Pope of Rome: this is the interdiction of the Councill of

Holy Ghoſt intendeth, but what they imagine. Nay, they are

Can there be a greater diſgrace to the Scripture then this is?
               22. Adde to theſe yet another deuice which is far worſe then4. all the reſt, & that is a groſſe and palpable wringing and wreſting out of the holy Scripture, a ſenſe contrary to the true intendment of the place, & fitting it ſtrangely to their own purpoſe. This is a practice of theirs ſo cōmon, as that their Books ſwarme with nothing ſo much as ſuch fond and fooliſh interpretations, and ſo ridiculous withall, that it would make euen Heraclitus himſelfe to laugh, if he were aliue. I wil here report ſome few of theſe ſtrange wreſted Expoſitions, that the Reader may haue a taſte of them, and ſo iudge of the whole caske.
               23. And to beginne at the beginning of the Bible, Geneſ. 1. 16. It is written, God created two great Lights, the greater to rule the day, and the leſſer to rule the night: that is (ſaith Innocentius
                  Innocent. 3. ad Conſt. Imper. cap. ſolit. de maior. Molin. tom. 1. de Iuſt. & iure. the third, one of their owne Popes: And alſo Molina the Ieſuite, God ordained in the Firmament of the Catholike Church two dignities, to wit, the Pontificiall dignitie, and the Regall: But that to gouerne the day, that is, the Spiritualty, and is the greater: and this to rule the night, that is the Carnalty, and is the leſſer; ſo that how great difference is betwixt the Sunne, and the Moone, ſo great is there betwixt the Biſhop of Rome, and a King, that is, according to the Gloſſe vpon the ſame place, ſeuen and fiftie times. So in the 3.Gloſſ. in ca. ſolit. de maior. of Geneſis, whereas the words of the Text are plaine, Hee ſhall breake thy head, or tread vpon thy head, which is the firſt and principall promiſe of the Meſſiah, they contrary both to the Hebrew, and Septuagint, tranſlate and expound it, Ipſa, She ſhall: applying vnto the Virgin Mary, that which properly belongeth vnto Chriſt, euen the worke of our Redemption. And this interpretation and tranſlation of that place is approued by the Councill of Trent, in approuing the vulgar LatineConc. Trident. Bellarm. Bible for authenticall: and by Bellarmine alſo, who calleth it

a great myſterie, that in the Hebrew, a verbe of the Maſculine gender, is ioyned with a Nowne of the foeminine; to ſignifie, that a woman ſhould breake the ſerpents head, but not by her ſelfe, but by her ſonne: and is alſo ſo tranſlated by our Doway Tranſlatours in Engliſh.
               24. So againe, that place in the Pſalme, Pſal. 91. 13. Thou ſhalt walke vpon the Aspe and the Cockatrice, and ſhalt tread vpon the Lion and the Dragon: Pope Alexander the third interpreted it of himſelfe, and the Emperour, applying the promiſeNaucler. Gen. 40. made to Chriſt principally, and in him to all the Elect, vnto himſelfe as Pope, and vnderſtanding by the Aſpe and Cockatrice, Lyon and Dragon, the Emperour Frederick, vpon whoſe necke hee ſet his foote, vſing thoſe words, and all other Kings and Emperours: and to proue that he ſo vnderſtood the place, when as the Emperor diſdayning this pride, made anſwere, Not to thee, but to Peter: the holy Father treading on his necke, replied; Et mihi & Petro, Both to mee and to Peter.

Againe, they interpret that place of Eſay 49. 23. They ſhall worſhip towards the face of the earth, and licke the duſt of thy feete, as a Prophecie of the Popes ſublimitie.

What a wreſting of Scripture call you this? Are not theſe ſtrange interpretations?
               25. But yet heare them which are more ſtrange and ridiculous: In the 28. of Eſay, 16. verſe wee read, Behold, I will

Againe, Cant. 5. 11. His head is as fine gold. And Cant. 7. 5. Thy head is like the mount Carmel. One of which is the ſpeech of the Church to Chriſt, and the other of Chriſt to the Church: but Bellarmine
                  Bel. ibid. interprets the firſt to be ſpoken Chriſt, and the ſecond of the Pope. Theſe be his words: The Bridegrome compareth the head of his Spouſe to mount Carmel, becauſe though the Pope be a great mountaine, yet he is nothing but earth, that is, a man: and the Bride compareth the Bridegromes head to the beſt gold, becauſe the head of Chriſt is God.
               
               26. But let vs come a little to the new Teſtament: are they any thing more ſhie and cautelous in this then in the olde? Heare and then iudge.

So Baronius alledgeth that of Act. 10. 13. Ariſe,

                  Peter, kill and eate, to proue the Popes power to excommunicate the Venetians. Kill, that is, excommunicate, and eate, that is, bring them to the obedience of the Church of Rome. This is goodly ſtuffe indeede: ſure they ſtand in neede of arguments to proue their cauſe, that are driuen to theſe ſilly ſhifts. So our Country-man Fiſher, to proue iuſtification by workes, alledgeth that Text of S. Peter, 1. Pet. 4. 8. Loue couereth the multitude of ſinnes, which he expounds thus, that loue expiateth and purgeth away the guilt of our ſinnes in the ſight of God, contrary to the direct ſenſe of the holy Ghoſt, Pro. 10. 12.
               27. It is a wonder to ſee, how both Bellarmine and all the Patrones of Purgatory wring and wreſt the Scripture, to vnderprop the Popes Kitchin: The Scripture cannot name fire and purging, but preſently there is Purgatory, as Eſay
                  Eſay 4. 4 & 9. 18. Mal. 3. 3. Zachar. 9. 11. Phil. 2. 10. Apoc. 5. 3. 4. 4. and 9. 18. Mal. 3. 3. nor a lake where there is no water, but there is Purgatory, as Zachar. 9. 11. nor things vnder the earth, Phil. 2. 10. Apoc. 5. 3. but there is Purgatory: and yet they themſelues confeſſe, that they know not whether it be vnder the earth or no, becauſe the Church hath not yet defined where it is. And Bellarmine bringeth in eight diuersBel. de Purgat. lib. 2. cap. 6. opinions, touching the place of Purgatory: but two of their expoſitions touching Purgatory, I cannot ouerpaſſe, left I ſhould depriue the Reader of matter of laughter in the midſt

of this ſerious diſcourſe, and them of commendation of wit; for they are witty aboue meaſure: the one is, Mar. 13. 34.Mark 13. 34. where it is ſaid in a Parable, that a certaine man going intoChemnit. exam. de Purga. p. 130 a ſtrange Country, leaueth his houſe, and giueth authority to his ſeruants, and commandeth the Porter to watch. This man going into a ſtrange Country, ſignifieth the ſoule (ſay they) which by death departeth out of this world: his leauing authority with his ſeruants, ſignifieth, that he commandeth his executors, to procure with his goods the prayers & ſuffrages of the Church, whereby he may be freed from Purgatory: hee commandeth the Porter to watch, that is, he giueth part of his goods to his Paſtor, that he may diligently ſacrifice for him by ſaying Maſſe. Who can doubt of Purgatory, that is thus authentically proued? The ſecond place is in the 8. Pſalme 7. Thou haſt put all things

               28. And thus much for a taſte of their falſe and fooliſh expoſitions; theſe being not the hundreth part of them, which are found in their writings. Let all men iudge now, whether theſe men deale well with the Scriptures or no, and whether they be friends or enemies to the ſacred word of God, & the Spirit of God that animateth it, that dare thus wretchedly abuſe it at their pleaſures, and wring it like a noſe of waxe, into any ſhape to make it ſerue their purpoſe. Eraſmus placethEraſ. encom. Moriae. that Frier in the Ship of fooles, that being asked what Text he had in the Scripture, for the putting of Heretikes to death, produced that of S. Paul, Tit. 3. 10.

This fellow by Eraſmus opinion, was worthy of a Garland, or rather of a Cockſcomb for his witty expoſition: and ſo was he alſo, that being asked where hee found the Virgin Mary in the olde Teſtament, anſwered, In the firſt of Geneſis, in this Text: Deus vocauit congregationem

it is in one of their Bookes, Inter Canonicas Scripturas decretales Epiſtolae connumerantur, (that is) The Decretall Epiſtles are numbred among theſe Canonicall Scriptures. As for Traditions, I haue ſhewed before, that it is a decree of the Councill of Trent, that they are to be receiued with as great affection of piety and reuerence, as the written Word of God. Againe, they adde vnto the Scripture, when they take vpon them to make new articles of faith, which haue no ground nor footing in the Scriptures: for vnto the twelue articles of the Apoſtles Creed, the Councill of Trent addeth twelue more, as may appeare in the Bull of Pius the fourth, in that publikeBull Pij 4. ſuper form.

               31. As for their detracting and taking away, they ſhew themſelues no leſſe impudent, for they haue taken away the ſecond Commandement, as appeareth in diuers of their Catechiſmes and Maſſe-bookes, becauſe it cutteth the throat of their Idolatry wholly out of the Decalogue: and to make vp the number of tenne, they diuide the laſt Commandement into two, contrary to all reaſon and authority: Yea, ſo impudentVaſq. li 2. diſp. 4 ca. 4. nu. 83. & cap. 7. nu. 115.

one kind: Yea, Cardinall Caietane, as Catharinus teſtifieth ofCatha. adu. Noua. Dogma. Caiet. pa. 1. & inde. him, cut off from the Scripture, the laſt Chapter of S.

Thus the Minor propoſition in this demonſtration is, I hope, ſufficiently prooued, to wit, that the Religion of the Church of Rome doth profeſſedly diſgrace the holy Scripture, as both by their doctrine, their practice, and their blaſphemous ſpeeches againſt it, doth manifeſtly appeare: and ſo the concluſion is of neceſſary and vndeniable conſequence, that therefore it deſerueth to be ſuſpected and reiected of all

thoſe that profeſſe themſelues to be friends to the Scripture, and hope from it either conſolation in this life, or ſaluation in the life to come.
            
            
               
                  MOTIVE. VII. That Religion is to be abhorred, which maintaineth, commandeth, and practiſeth groſſe and palpable Idolatry; but ſo doth the Religion of the Church of Rome: Ergo, &c.
               WHen I conſider the fearefull Idolatry of the Church of Rome, which for that cauſe is called The Whore of Babylon, and The Mother of fornications, Reuel. 17. 1. 2. IReuel. 17. 1. 2. cannot chooſe but wonder, that any ſhould be ſo bewitched with the ſorceries of this Iezabel, or made drunke with the wine of her fornication, that they ſhould take her marke vpon their forheads, and right hands, and ioyne with her in her abominations: and not rather come out of her with all ſpeed, as they are admoniſhed by the Angell, leſt they bee partakers in her ſinnes, and haue a ſhare alſo with her in herReuel. 18. 4. plagues: but then againe, remembring that which S.

                   them ſtrong deluſion to beleeue lies: I turne my wondering at their ſottiſhneſſe into the admiration at Gods Iuſtice and Truth: the one in puniſhing their contempt of his Goſpell, with ſuch a giddineſſe of ſpirit: and the other in making good his owne word after ſuch an euident and manifeſt manner, that there by it moſt clearely appeareth, that the Pope of Rome is that Man of ſinne, and Sonne of perdition there ſpoken of, euen that Antichriſt which exalteth himſelfe aboue all that is called God, and ſitteth in the Temple of God, as if he were God. As this appeareth in many groſſe errors which they hold, ſo in none more, then in the horrible idolatry practiſed and preached, & defended in this Antichriſtian Church; of which I may truely ſay, as Plutarch ſaid of the heathen,Plutarch in vit▪ Romul. that they mingle heauen with earth, becauſe they made Gods of
                  
                  men, & men of Gods: So theſe, whilſt they giue diuine worſhip to earthly creatures, as the croſſe & pictures of Chriſt, and to the Saints in heauen; or attribute earthly affections, to heauenly creatures, make a plaine mixture of heauen and earth, ſpoyling the Creatour of his honour, due vnto his Dietie, and adorning the creature therewith; and aſcribing that vnto men, which is onely proper vnto God. That the Church of Rome is guilty of this impiety, I hope by Gods grace ſo to proue in this Motiue, that no Ieſuite (though neuer ſo ſubtill) ſhall bee able with any ſhew of ſound reaſon to hiſſe againſt.
               2. The firſt propoſition in this Argument, though it be ofMAIOR. ſo euident a truth, that it needeth no further demonſtration, yet becauſe S. Paul ſaith, that an Idoll is nothing in the world, and thereupon, ſome may peraduenture conclude, that Idolatrie is a matter of nothing, and a ſmall and triuiall ſinne: I will therefore very briefly ſhew the greatneſſe and haynouſneſſe of this ſinne, and how odious and abominable it is in the ſight of God. As touching therefore that phraſe of Saint Paul, An Idoll is nothing, it is not to bee vnderſtood, either in reſpect of matter, for euery Idoll hath a materiall being,Exod. 32. 4. and ſubſiſting, as the matter of the Calfe, which the Iſraelites made in the Wilderneſſe, was gold, and of the brazen ſerpent,2. Reg. 18. 4. which was abuſed alſo as an Idoll, was braſſe, and of thoſe Idols, which the Prophet Eſay declameth ſo againſt, were
                     Eſay 44. 10. Bel. de Imag. lib. 2. c. 5. Caiet▪ in loc. wood: nor yet in reſpect of forme, as Bellarmine and Caietane would haue it. As though the Apoſtle ſhould meane thus, that an Idoll, though it hath matter, yet it hath no forme, that is to ſay, is the repreſentation of ſuch a thing as hath no being in nature: for many of the Idols of the Gentiles were of ſuch things as truly were: but the Apoſtles meaning is, as Tertullian obſerues, and many other, both of ancientTertul. de core. milit. cap. 7. and late Writers, that an Idoll is nothing in reſpect of that which it is intended to bee, that is, that it is no God, nor hath any part of the Diuinitie in it, which deſerueth to bee worſhipped: or that it is nothing in regard of efficacie and power, that is, as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaketh, is not able to doe either

good or bad, to hurt, or to helpe; to ſaue, or to kill: and this interpretation is authorized by S. Augustine and S. Chryſostome,
                  Chryſoſt. hom. 20. in Epiſt. 1. ad Corin. Aug. cont. Fauſt. Manich. l. 20. c. 5 the one ſaying thus, There are Idols indeede, but they can doe nothing, neither are they Gods: the other thus, Sunt Idola, ſed ad ſalutem nihil ſunt, There are Idols, but they auaile nothing to the attaynement of ſaluation: and it is alſo approued by many other Expoſitors, both ancient and moderne Proteſtants and Papiſts, and is moſt agreeable to the whole current of the Text. This then that S. Paul ſaith, That an Idoll is nothing, is both ſo farre from extenuating the ſinne of Idolatrie, that it aggrauateth the ſame, and alſo ſo farre from clearing the Church of Rome from the guilt of that crime, that it rather layeth a greater ſtayne thereof vpon it.
               3. As for the greatneſſe of the ſinne, it may appeare by three conſiderations; firſt, of the precept: for there is no one commandement of the Law ſo frequent in the whole Scripture, and ſo ſtrictly vrged, and mounded and fenced about with ſo many reaſons, as that is againſt Idolatrie: as we may ſee in the Decalogue. Secondly, in reſpect of the puniſhmentExod. 20. 2. 3. 4. denounced againſt, and inflicted vpon the committers thereof, to wit, not onely eternall death from the iuſtice of God, which is the wages of all ſinne vnrepented of: butPſal. 97. 7. 1. Cor. 6. 9. Apoc. 21. 8. Exod. 22. 20. Deut. 17. 5 6. alſo temporall death from the iuſtice of man, as being vnworthy to breathe this common ayre, or to tread vpon the earth, that thus ſinne againſt the Maieſtie of God: and that not onely the worſhippers of Idols themſelues, but they that ſhould entice or perſwade any to Idolatry: The executionDeut. 13. 5. of which Lawes, wee ſee put in practice vpon the Iſraelites, Gods owne people, in the 32. of Exod. and 23. of Numbers. Thirdly and laſtly, in reſpect of the nature of the ſinne: which is firſt a ſenſleſſe ſinne, full of folly, contrary to the very lightPſa. 115. 15. 16. Eſay 44. 9. 19. of reaſon and nature, as both the Prophet Dauid and Eſay at large proue. And ſecondly, a ſinne, full of impiety, becauſe they that worſhip an Idoll, worſhip the Deuill, as S. Paul affirmeth, 1. Cor. 10. 20. And laſtly, a ſinne moſt oppoſite to the1. Cor. 10. 20. glory of God, and conſequently ſooner procuring the vengeance

of God, then any other; for it is called in the Scripture ſpirituall forn
                        •
                     cation and adulterie, becauſe the IdolaterEſay 57. 7. 8. Ier. 3. 6. 7. Ezech. 16. 15. forſaketh God, and proſtituteth himſelfe to an Idoll, and that in Gods preſence. And therefore as corporall fornication is the onely cauſe of diuorce betwixt man and wife: ſo this ſinne onely cauſeth God to diuorce himſelfe from his Church, and to take from her all her ornaments and Iewels, that is, his Word and Sacraments, and to giue her ouer into the hands of her enemies. Thus the greatneſſe of this ſinne of Idolatry, is manifeſt, and from thence I may conclude my firſt propoſition, that that Religion which maintayneth and commandeth this ſinne, ſo full of folly, impiety, and contrariety to God, is worthy not onely to be ſuſpected, but euen abhorred, and deteſted of all men.
               4. But let vs come to the examination of the ſecond propoſition,MINOR. to wit, whether the Church of Rome bee guilty of this great ſinne or no. The Romaniſts mainly denie it, as they haue great reaſon: for if their Religion bee proued to maintaine Idolatrie, they know that it muſt needes fall to the ground: and therefore they deuiſe all manner of ſhifts, to deliuer themſelues from this imputation. But we on the other ſide confidently affirme it, and that the world may ſee, wee doe it not without great reaſon, wee confirme our affirmation with this ſtrong argument: Whoſoeuer aſcribeth diuine honour to any creature, is an Idolater: but the Romaniſts aſcribe diuine honour to many creatures, therefore they are Idolaters: and leſt any ſhould thinke this to bee the errour of priuate perſons, and not the hereſie of their Religion, I adde vnto the Minor, that all the Romaniſts doe this from the very grounds of their faith, and that in ſo doing, they are warranted from their Religion it ſelfe.
               5. They deny both the Maior and Minor propoſition in this argument, and in denying them, eſpecially the Maior, they giue iuſt cauſe of vehement ſuſpition, if not of plaine demonſtration, that they are guilty of the crime whereof wee accuſe them: for if a thiefe ſtanding at the barre, being accuſed of a robbery by the high way ſide ſhould anſwere that

to take money from a man by the high way ſide at Nooneday, was not theft, all men would thinke that hee was guilty of the robbery, and ſo the Iurie would finde him: then certainely the Romaniſts, by denying this to be the true definition of Idolatry, which is propounded in the firſt propoſition, bewray their owne guiltineſſe, and giue vs more cauſe to ſuſpect them, then we had before.
               6. But let vs heare their ſhifts: they principally are two, one of Bellarmine, the other of 
                     Ʋalentia, two maine poſts in the houſe of Popery. Bellarmine would faine vndermine this propoſition (to giue to creatures diuine honour, is Idolatry) by aBell. de Eccleſtriumph. l. 2. c. 5. diſtinction betwixt an Idol and an Image, affirming that an Image is the ſimilitude of a thing that hath a true being, but an Idol of a ſained thing, that indeed is not: and therevpon he ſeemes to conclude, that to aſcribe diuine honour to ſome Images, is not Idolatry, becauſe euery Image is not an Idoll. In the proofe of this diſtinction he labours much, and profits little: for like the heedleſſe fiſh, hee leapes out of the Frying-pan into the fire, and tyes the knot faſter which he would ſeeme to vntie: for firſt, all the Idolatry of the Church of Rome conſiſteth not in worſhipping of Images, but in many other things, as ſhall appeare in the Diſcourſe following. Secondly, if to worſhip the Image of a true thing, be not Idolatry, then the Gentiles were not Idolaters in worſhipping the Image of Iupiter, and Mars, and Diana, and Romulus, and Aeſculapius, and the Sunne, becauſe (as Bellarmine himſelfe confeſſeth) all the Idols of the Gentiles were the ſtatues of
                  Ibid. cap. 8. Aug. cont. Fauſt. lib. 20. cap. 3. 
                  men. And Saint Auguſtine alſo affirmeth, That the Gentiles did worſhip thoſe things which were in being, but were not to bee worſhipped: and then the Iſraelites did not commit Idolatry in the Wilderneſſe, when they adored the golden Calfe, nor was that Calfe an Idoll, contrary to the expreſſe Text of Scripture, Acts 7. 41. becauſe it was a repreſentation of a trueActs 7. 41. Exod. 32. 5. thing, namely, of the true Iehouah, as it is euident, Exodus 32. 5. Thirdly, let it be graunted, that an Idoll is onely the ſimilitude of an imaginary and fained thing; yet will not this acquite them of Idolatry, ſeeing they worſhip in the Romiſh

Church, the Images of things which either neuer were, or were not ſuch as they are taken to bee, as the Image of S. Katharine, and Saint Chriſtopher, and Saint George, and ſuch others: the truth whereof they are not able to proue by any approoued Hiſtorie: Nay it is confeſſed, that many are worſhipped in the Church as Saints, which are tormented in hell fire for their ſinnes. This ſhift therefore of Bellarmine, to wipe off the blot of Idolatry, is but a ſilly one, and blurres them more then they were before.

Gregory de Ʋalentia labours to creepe out at anotherGreg. de Valent. de Idol. li. 2. ca. 7. hole, to wit, not by a diſtinction, but by addition: for hee would adde vnto the definition of Idolatry theſe words, ſicut Deo, as to God: and ſo Idolatry ſhould bee not a giuing of diuine honour to a creature, but when it is ſo giuen to the creature, as vnto God.

Beſides, which is more vnreaſonable, he maketh things to be of a contradictory oppoſition, which are one and the ſame in nature: for to giue diuine honour to the creature, is not Idolatry (ſaith hee) but to worſhip a creature as God, is Idolatry: whereas in verie

truth, to giue diuine honour to a creature, is to worſhip that creature as God; and to worſhip a creature as God, is no more nor leſſe, then to giue diuine honour vnto it, as any man of vulgar ſenſe may eaſily diſcerne.

               10. Fathers: for all of them with one conſent define Idolatry to be nothing elſe, but the attributing of diuine honour to the Creatures, as Thomas Aquinas out of them all concludes, that this is Idolatry, quando honor ſoli Deo debitus, exhibetur creaturae, that is, when that honour which is onely due vnto God, is beſtowed vpon a creature. Hee that would ſee the Fathers particular definitions hereof, let him reade the places quoted in the Margent, which for breuity ſake I ouerpaſſe.

               11. But enough of them: let vs leaue the two Cubs in their holes, and come to the hunting of the olde Foxe, the Idolatrous Church it ſelfe. That the Church of Rome attributes diuine honour to creatures, appeareth by this, becauſe truſt, and confidence, inuocation, vowes, ſacrifice, adoration, all which are giuen by them vnto creatures, are all parts of diuine honour, and worſhip: For truſt and confidence, the Prophet Ieremie ſo appropriateth it to the Lord,Ier. 17. 5, 7. that he denieth it to all other, Ier. 17. 5, 7. Curſed be hee that trusteth in man, and maketh fleſh his arme, and withdraweth his heart from the Lord. And then he addeth: but, bleſſed bee the man that trusteth in the Lord, and whoſe hope the Lord is: And S. Peter more plainely, 1. Pet. 5. 7. doth bid vs, to caſt all our
                  1. Pet. 5. 7. 
                  care vpon God. Now if all confidence, and our truſt, or care, is to be repoſed in the Lord, then there is no part nor piece thereof to beeb ſtowed vpon any creature, and that as all, ſo onely it belongeth to the Lord. Chriſt himſelfe teacheth, Math. 4. 10. interpreting that place of Deut. 6. 13. and 10. 20.Math. 4. 10. Deut 6. 13. & 10. 20. for whereas Moſes ſaith, Thou ſhalt feare the Lord thy God and ſerue him. Chriſt the beſt Expoſitor of the Law that euer was, himſelfe being the end, and perfection of the Law, doth thus alledge it, adding this word (onely) vnto the Text, Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him onely ſhalt thou ſerue: Whereby he euidently declareth, that all the parts of Gods worſhip are to bee reſtrained by this word onely, that is, that they ſo belong vnto the Lord, that it is ſacriledge, if not Idolatry, to communicate them to any other, and ſo of

               12. To this alſo, conſent all the Fathers: Ierome ſaith, If we muſt put our confidence in any, let vs haue our affiance in God alone. And Baſil, As it is meete to worſhip nothing beſide God, ſo wee muſt fixe our hope in one God. Augustine thus. Saints are to be honoured for imitation, and not to be adored for Religion. Epiphanius thus. Let Mary bee honoured, but not adored: let the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt bee adored. Laſtly, Ambroſe determines the poynt moſt effectually, thus. Is any ſo mad (ſaith hee) that will giue to the Earle the honour of the King? Yet theſe men (marke this, you idolatrous brood of Babylon) doe not thinke themſelues guilty, who giue the honour of Gods name to a creature; and leauing the Lord, adore their fellow ſeruants, as though there were any thing more reſerued for God. This is iuſt your caſe, and therefore by the iudgement of this good Father, you ſtand as guilty before Gods iudgement ſeat of Idolatry.

But all theſe are but generall conſiderations: let vs therefore ſee in particular, how theſe parts of Gods worſhip, are by the Religion of the Church of Rome, aſſigned vnto creatures, and to what creatures they are aſſigned, that the Strumpet of Babylon may haue no mantle to couer her vncleanneſſe. I might here begin with the Pope himſelfe, and ſhew how hee is made an Idoll in the Church of Rome, and worſhipped as God: yea, takes to himſelfe the titles of God, and ſuffers himſelfe to be called God, and receiueth adorations, proſtrations, and kiſſing of the ſeete from all his followers:Aug.

And thoſe are theſe fiue in number, the bread in the Sacrament, Images, Reliques, Angels and Saints departed. And laſtly, the Croſſe and Crucifix: of which in order.
               14. The bleſſed Sacrament of the body and bloud of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, ordayned for a perpetuall remembrance of his death and paſſion; and for the ſtrengthning, and nouriſhing of the ſoules of the faithfull, to eternall life, is tranſhaped by them into a moſt horrible Idoll. For this they teach and practiſe, that that very thing, which to all the ſenſes, is but bread, being but lately moulded and knead by the Baker, is to be worſhipped, and adored with diuine worſhip,

And therefore at the Prieſts eleuation of the hoaſt, they all fall downe vpon their knees, and worſhip it with great deuotion, and expect from it forgiueneſſe of their ſinnes, and all manner of earthly and temporall bleſſings, and whoſoeuer refuſeth to doe this, is an Heretike.
               15. Their Apologie is, that there is a reall and naturall preſence of Chriſts body and bloud in the Sacrament, and therefore not the bread, but the body of Chriſt, into which the bread is tranſubſtantiate, is worſhipped of them, and ſo they thinke, to free themſelues. To which I anſwere, that if

that were certaine, then their defence was iuſt, and their practice godly, and we in calling them Idolaters, for this cauſe ſhould bee ſlanderers of the truth: but ſeeing the contrary is rather certaine, to wit, that Chriſt is not corporally in the Sacrament, but in heauen: and that the bread remayneth ſtill true bread, both for matter and forme after conſecration: they cannot be excuſed from notorious Idolatry, in worſhipping a piece of Bakers bread, in ſtead of Chriſt, the eternall Sonne of God: for to the outward ſenſes, it beareth the ſhape, taſte, figure, and colour of bread. This is certaine, and to the vnderſtanding, in reaſon it is bread, becauſe accidents cannot be without a ſubſtance: this is as certaine, and to faith it is bread, becauſe the Word, which is the foundation of1. Cor. 10. & 11 ſaith, ſo calleth it, after the words of conſecration, neither is there any Scripture to auouch the contrary, ſaue that which may well receiue our interpretation as well, yea, better then theirs, as the beſt learned amongſt them confeſſe: for, Bellarmine

               16. Beſides, graunt that there is a reall tranſubſtantiation of the bread and wine, into the body and blood of Chriſt: yet the accidents of bread and wine remaine vnchanged, and the forme and ſhape. Now, howſoeuer the learned may here diſtinguiſh their worſhip, from the outward accidents, to the inward ſubſtance; yet the common people are not able ſo to doe, but worſhip confuſedly the outward accidents together with Chriſt contayned vnder them; and ſo in that reſpect, are Idolaters alſo: for accidents be creatures as well as ſubſtances: Yea, and Bellarmine alſo doth allow them ſo to d

                  the Symboles and ſignes of bread and wine, ſo farre forth as they are apprehended, as being vnited to Chriſt whom they containe.
                  
Euen as they that worſhipped Chriſt vpon earth being clothed, did not worſhip him alone, but after a ſort his garments alſo. Here is a braue ſtraine of Diuinity, they worſhipped Chriſt in his clothes, therfore they worſhipped Chriſts clothes: So Chriſt is worſhipped vnder the formes of bread and wine: therefore the formes of bread and wine muſt be worſhipped. This is like the Aſſe, which bore vpon his backe the Image of Iſis: and when men fell downe before the Image, he thought they worſhipped him: but hee was corrected with a cudgell for his ſawcineſſe; and ſo are they worthy for their folly, that cannot diſtinguiſh betwixt a man and his garments, Chriſt and the ſignes of Chriſt, but promiſcuouſly confound the worſhip of the one with the other. Rather therefore may we thus conclude: they which worſhipped Chriſt on earth, did not worſhip his garments that he wore: therefore they which will worſhip Chriſt in the Sacrament, muſt not worſhip the outward Elements; and ſo it will follow, that as it had beene Idolatry in any to worſhip the garments of Chriſt: ſo it is in the Romaniſts, to worſhip the accidents of bread and wine.
               17. Laſtly, let it be ſuppoſed, that there is ſuch a reall preſence of Chriſt in the Sacrament; yet according to the doctrine of the Church of Rome, no man can be certaine when it is, becauſe it depends vpon the intention of the Prieſt: forSum. Roſel. verb. Lu

                     . 13. Pro. 6. thus they teach, if the Prieſt ſhould ſay the words of conſecration, without intention to conſecrate the bread and wine, he ſhould effect nothing: or if hee intend to conſecrate but one hoaſt, and there chance to be two, or more, then nothing is conſecrated at all: and ſo the intention of the Prieſt, being vncertaine to the people, there muſt needes be an vncertaine adoration: and the Prieſt oftentimes intending nothing leſſe, then the matter it ſelfe which hee hath in hand, there muſt needes be certaine and vndoubted Idolatry: for if the bread and wine be not effectually conſecrated, as they are not without the Prieſts intention, then Chriſt is not really preſent; and ſo nothing is worſhipped, but the bare bread: for remedy hereof, they haue deuiſed two poore ſhifts: one, that the people muſt adore vpon a condition, to wit, if the due forme

in conſecrating bee obſerued: the other, that an actuall intention is not neceſſarily required, but onely a vertuall, that is, when an actuall intention to conſecrate, is not preſent at the very time of conſecration, by reaſon of ſome vagation of the minde, yet it was preſent a little before, the operation is in vertue thereof.
               18. This is Bellarmines. But to the firſt, I anſwere, That though the people ought to doe ſo, that is, adore vpon condition; which notwithſtanding, is a thing neuer heard of before in any diuine worſhip, and implieth neceſſity of danger; yet becauſe not one amongſt a thouſand doe ſo, hauing neuer heard that diſtinction once named in their liues, nor vnderſtanding what it meaneth, therefore they are for this neuer a whit freed from Idolatry. To the ſecond, I anſwere, that oftentimes the Prieſt hath neither actuall nor vertuall intention: for what intent had the Monke Bernhardine, that poyſonedEgnat. the hoaſt, to the intent that he might poyſon the Emperour Henry of Lucenburgh, as he alſo did at the inſtigation of Robert King of Sicily? What intent had that Prieſt, thatSpondan Annal. Eccleſ. an. 1055. Volateran. Houed

                     n. Math. Pariſ. either did, or would haue poyſoned Pope 
                     Ʋictor the ſecond, as witneſſeth Baronius? or thoſe Prieſts that poyſoned William Archbiſhop of Yorke? for hee was poyſoned at the Maſſe, by the treaſon of his owne Chaplins: both with that, which was in the Chalice. If the Prieſt bee an Athieſt, as many of the Popes themſelues were, what intention haue they of conſecrating Chriſts body, when they beleeue not that Chriſt hath a body, or that there is a Chriſt now liuing in the heauens, and ſitting at the right hand of his Father, to be preſent in the Sacrament? or what intention can they haue to doe that which the Church doth, when as they beleeue not, that there is a Church: but that all Religion is a fable, and a matter of policy? Here muſt needes be groſſe and notable Idolatry, by their owne confeſſion: for I argue, Ex conceſſis, that is, out of their owne grounds. So that we muſt iuſtly conclude, notwithſtanding all their diſtinctions and ſhifts, that the Church of Rome, in worſhipping the conſecrated hoaſt, and that with ſuch worſhip, as is due vnto God, is guilty of Artolatry, that

is, of worſhipping a piece of bread, in ſtead of God, then which, what can be more Heatheniſh and palpable Idolatry?
               19. Secondly, wee indite them of Idolatry, for that they2. teach, that Images are to bee worſhipped with diuine worſhip: and in their practice, they giue vnto ſtockes and ſtones the honour which belongeth vnto God. For this is their doctrine, that the Images of the bleſſed Trinity, and of Chriſt, and of the Virgin Mary the mother of Chriſt, and of other Saints, are to be had and retained, eſpecially in Churches:Concil. Trid. decret. de Imag. 
                  ijſque debitum honorem & venerationem impertiandam, and that due honour and worſhip is to be giuen vnto them: they be the words of the Councill of Trent. Now, what that due honour and worſhip is, that is a great queſtion among them: ſome thinke it is the ſame which appertaineth to the perſons whom they repreſent; as if it be the Image of God or Chriſt: then it is to be worſhipped, latria, that is, with the highest degree of worſhip: if of the Virgin Mary, then with a little lower degree called 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , if of the Saints, then with the loweſt, which they call 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , and this is the tenet of many of their Rabbies (as reporteth Vaſques the Ieſuite) to wit, Aquinas,
                  
                     Ʋide Vaſq. Ieſuit. de adorat. 
                  Caietane, Bonauenture, Alexander, Coster, and diuers others. Others thinke, that the Image is not to be worſhipped at all: but onely the Samplar before the Image. Of this opinion were Durandus, Alphonſus de Castro, and ſome others,Bel. d Imag. cap. 20. Durand. lib. 3. ſent. d. 9. q. 2. Alphonſ. de Caſtro. verb. Imag. but it is confuted by Catharine, and vtterly reiected by Bellarmine. A third ſort were of opinion, that Images ought to bee worſhipped in themſelues, and properly with a leſſe honour then the Samplar: and therefore that no Image was to be worſhipped with Latria. Of this opinion were Pereſius, Catharinus, Sanders, Gabriel, &c. But the Councill of Trent, which is their Church, in the wordes of the decree, and Bellarmine
                  Bel. de Imag. cap. 20. which is their chiefe champion, doe manifeſtly incline to the firſt opinion: for this is the ſumme of his propoſitions: Firſt,Ibid. cap. 22. 23. 24. that the Images of Chriſt, & the Saints are to be worſhipped, not onely by accident, and improperly, but euen by themſelues, and properly: ſo that they doe limit the worſhip, as they are Images; and not onely as they ſtand in ſtead of their

patternes. Secondly, that in truth and deed, Images may be worſhipped with the ſame kind of worſhip which belongeth vnto their patternes, improperly, and by accident, and ſo with Latria in that condition. Thirdly, and laſtly, that though this be true, yet eſpecially in the pulpits, and before the people, it isP
                        •
                     aeſertim in concione ad populum. not to be ſaid that Images are to bee worſhipped with this kind of worſhip, but rather the contrary. Heere is excellent diuinity: the people muſt not bee taught the truth, nay the contrary rather, which is a lie, and that in the pulpit: beholde here a doctor of lies, and that by his owne confeſſion, whilſt he goeth about to maintaine Images, which Habacuk calleth,Habac. 2. 18. doctors of lies. Hab. 2▪ 18.
               20. This is the ſumme of their doctrine. Out of all which theſe three concluſions doe ariſe. Firſt, that the bleſſed Trinity, that ſacred and incomprehenſible deitie, by their doctrine may be pictured on a wall, and worſhipped in or at an Image; yea, that ſuch an Image ought at leaſt improperly bee worſhipped with the ſame worſhip that is due vnto God himſelf: as whē they picture God the Father in the ſimilitude of an old man, & God the Son in the likenes of a yong child, & God the holy Ghoſt in the likeneſſe of a Doue, which the Scripture in the ſecond Commandement condemneth as Idolatrie: and that the intendment of that Commandement is not againſt the Images of falſe gods onely, as the Romaniſts would haue it, but alſo of the true Iehouah: Moſes the beſt expounder of himſelfe, teacheth moſt plainely, Deut. 4. 16. when hee ſaith,Deut. 4. 16. 
                  Take heed that you make not to your ſelues any grauen Image, or repreſentation of any figure: for you ſaw no Image in the day that the Lord ſpake vnto you in Horeb, out of the midſt of the fire: and the Prophet Eſay confirming the ſame expoſition, ſaith, To whom will you liken God? or what ſimilitude will yee ſet vp vnto him? Eſay 40. 18. as if he ſhould ſay, it is impoſſible to repreſentEſay 40. 18. God by any likeneſſe or ſimilitude. If they reply that they worſhip not the Image, but God in the Image, I anſwer, Firſt, that the very Image of God is an Idoll by this Commandement: and therefore, the erecting of it to a religious vſe, is Idolatry. Secondly, that it is falſe which they ſay, that they

worſhip not the Image, but God in the Image: for their doctrine is contrary, as hath beene ſhewed, and their practice is contrary, as ſhall be declared hereafter. Thirdly, though it be true which they alledge, yet the worſhipping of God before an Image, is Idolatry: for when the children of Iſrael worſhipped the two golden calues at Dan and Bethel, they were not ſuch calues, to worſhip the outward calues, but God in them: and therefore the worſhip of them is called, the feare of Iehouah:
                  1. Reg. 17. 28. and yet they are branded for Idolaters in that reſpect. The like I might ſay of the golden Calfe in the wilderneſſe, and of that Image which Micha erected. Fourthly, and laſtly, that theIudg. 17. true God worſhipped in or before an Image, is made an Idol, becauſe (as Saint Auguſtine ſaith) they that worſhip God in any other ſort then he hath appointed, worſhip not him, but that which
                  Aug. de conſenſ. Euangel. lib. 1. cap. 18. 
                  they had fayned, that is, an Idoll of their owne fancy: and therefore the Scripture ſaith, when the Iewes worſhipped God in the golden Calfe, they turned God into the likeneſſe of a beaſtPſal. 106. 20. which eateth graſſe.
               21. The ſecond concluſion to bee obſerued, is, that by their doctrine the Images of Chriſt are to be adored with ſuch worſhip, as is belonging vnto Chriſt himſelfe, though improperly: and that this worſhip is to be bounded within the compaſſe of the Image, without relation to the Samplar. By which is euident: Firſt, that by their owne confeſſion they are Idolaters improperly: and ſecondly, that truſt and confidence is to be put in ſuch an Image, & vowes, and prayers, and ſacrifices to be made vnto it: for all theſe are parts of diuine worſhip, which muſt be confined to the Image, and ſo they are not improperly, but properly Idolaters: and then by this we may ſee that the caueat inſerted in the decree of the Councill of Trent, is but a meere ſophiſtication: for whereas the decree ſaith, that Images muſt be ſo worſhipped, that truſt and confidence be not placed in them: in affirming that ſome ought to bee worſhipped with Latria, they enioyne plainely, that men ſhould repoſe their truſt and confidence in them: and thus they bewray the fraud of the decree, and their owne ſecret impiety.
               
                  22. The third concluſion is that ſame Hyperdulia, or extraordinary reuerence, which they ſay is due to the Image of the bleſſed Virgin; and that Dulia, or common ſeruice, which they aſſigne to the Images of other Saints, is no leſſe then Idolatry, let them extenuate the matter neuer ſo much by titles and diſtinctions; for it is religious worſhip: all which is dueReuel. 19. 10. and 22. 9. vnto God onely, Reuel. 19. 10. and 22. 9. The Angel would not ſuffer Iohn to performe any outward worſhip vnto him, nor ſo much as proſtrate himſelfe before him; but commanded him to worſhip God; and yet Iohn knew him to be but an Angel, and therefore meant not to giue him any thing but outward reuerence, yet he refuſed it vpon this ground, that all religious worſhip, both outward and inward, belongeth onely vnto God. So Mardochee the Iew refuſed to bow the knee to Haman the Agagite, becauſe the honour which was giuen vnto him, was more then ciuill; for he was made a petty God: and therefore in the fragments of Hester, this reaſon is giuen by himſelfe, I did it, becauſe I would not preferre the honour of
                  Heſter 13. 14. 
                  a man, before the glory of God, and would not worſhip any but thee, my Lord: therefore, the bowing of the knee, or proſtrating of the body after a religious manner, is due onely vnto God, and is part of diuine worſhip: to bow the knee, and proſtrate the body after a ciuill manner, is lawfull to Kings and Princes, and others that are either exalted in gouernment, or endued with excellent gifts and graces of God; but to doe the ſame in a religious reſpect, is proper onely to God, becauſe it preſuppoſeth the knowing of the heart, an omni-preſence, and an infinite power to helpe. And thus this ſame Hyperdulia and Dulia, wherewith they worſhip the Image of the Virgin, and other Saints, is open and plaine Idolatry: and the rather, becauſe it is ſeldome or neuer ſeuered from Latria, that is, the inward worſhip of the ſoule, which, as they ſay, is onely due vnto God: as by their practice more plainely ſhall appeare.
               23. Thus we ſee the morrow and myſtery of their doctrine diſcouered: now let vs take a view of their practice. And firſt, what worſhip can bee more performed vnto God, then they

giue vnto their Images? they kneele to them, they pray to them, they vow vowes to them, they offer offerings to them, they ſweare by them, they proſtrate their bodies before them: let Polydore Virgill, one of their owne ſworne fauorites, who would not, we may preſume, ſpeake any thing too lauiſhly of his owne, but rather bee ſparing in their diſgrace, deſcribe their manners. Men (ſaith hee) are growne to that madneſſe,
                  Polyd. Virgil. de Inuent. l. 6. c. 13. 
                  that this part of piety is little differing from flat impiety: for there are very many of the rude and ignorant, which worſhip the very Images of wood or ſtone, of marble, or braſſe, or pictures painted vpon the walls, not as figures, but euen as if they had verily ſenſe, and doe put more truſt in them, then they doe in Chriſt, or other Saints, to whom they are dedicated. Thus doth this man deſcribe the practice of their Idolatry; and much more might be found in him to that purpoſe, but that the Spaniſh Cenſours haue taken order by their Index Expurgatorius, that he ſhall not doe them much hurt. But if this mans teſtimony will not ſerue the turne, let vs heare another of the ſame ranke, a man of great learning and iudgement, Cornelius
                  Cornel Agrippa de vanit. cap. 57. 
                  Agrippa, who thus complaineth: The corrupt manner, and falſe Religion of the Gentiles, hath infected our Religion, and hath brought into the Church Images and pictures, with many vaine ceremonies of externall pompe, none whereof was found amongst the firſt and true Christians. Hence wee began to bring into our Churches dumbe Images, and to place them vpon Gods Altars with great reuerence, and whither we account it vnlawfull for a man, the true Image of God, to aſcend, thither we tranſlate ſenſeleſſe Images: to them we bow our heads, giue kiſſes, offer lights, hang vp gifts, apply myracles, & buy pardons of them. To conclude, to them we goe a pilgrimage, to them we make vowes, them we inwardly worſhip, and not only outwardly adore, neither can it be vttered how great ſuperſtition; that I may not ſay Idolatry, is nouriſhed amongst the rude and ignorant people, in Images, the Prieſts winking thereat, and reaping thereby no ſmall gaine to their purſes. Adde vnto theſe Caſſanders teſtimony, another learned man of an indifferent ſpirit. It is more manifeſt (ſaith he) then

                     . de Imag. 
                  that it needeth any long explication, that the worſhip of Images
                  
                  hath too much preuailed, and that the affection, or rather ſuperſtition of the people, hath beene too much fauoured in this regard: ſo that Chriſtians ſeeme to be nothing inferiour to Pagans, in the adoration, which they vſed to exhibite to their Idols, and in the vanity, which they ſhewed in making and adorning their Images. And a little after, he bringeth in a ſaying of Gabriel Biell, toGab. Bielin ean. lect. 49. this effect. The blockiſh errour of certaine men is ſo great, and they are ſo affected to Images, that they thinke that ſome diuine grace, or ſanctity reſideth in them, by which they are able to worke myracles, and giue health: and for that cauſe they worſhip them, to the end, they might obtaine ſome ſuch benefit at their hands: and their ſimplicity is ſo great, that they worſhip with greater deuotion faire Images then foule, new then old, thoſe that are adorned with gold and purple, then thoſe that are naked and bare: yea, they make vowes, and binde themſelues to goe a pilgrimage, now to this, now to that Church, in regard of certaine Images, ſuppoſing that greater vertues doe ſhine forth in one then another.
               
               24. Thus doth this learned man, together with the two former, deſcribe the miſerable Idolatry of the Church of Rome, which is committed by the worſhipping of Images. They were all three Romaniſts, and no doubt, but would ſpeake of their owne fauourites as fauourably as they could; and therefore we may well imagine, that their impiety was farre more groſſe, when it wreſted out of their owne mouthes this plaine confeſſion. But if a Proteſtant ſhould ſpeake, hee would tell another tale, and make them march in equipage with the Pagans in Idolatry, as Caſſander after a ſort confeſſeth; and that not without great reaſon: For firſt, the

Paynims, when they bowed to ſtockes & ſtones, pretended, that they worſhipped not the Images, but them, after whoſe likeneſſe they were figured, as teſtifie Lactantius, Augustine, Chryſostome, and Seneca. Now the Romaniſts doe vſe the very ſame excuſe to cloke their Idolatry, that they worſhip not the Images properly, but God, Chriſt, Angels, Saints in them, and at them. Secondly, the Paynims Idols are deſcribed in the 115. Pſalme, To haue eyes and not to ſee, eares and

And finally, to haue no breath in their noſtrils: but the Romiſh Images are in euery reſpect like vnto them: let them ſhew that their Images can heare, ſee, ſpeake, ſmell, and goe, better then theirs, and then we will not ſay their Idols to be like to theirs.

And S. Bernard in a ieſting anſwere diſcouered the ſecond, when he anſwered, that it was againſt the Canons, for her Ladyſhip to ſpeake in the Church being a woman. And the Biſhop of Cheſter diſcredited the third, when he manifeſtedDownam de Antich. li. 1 c. 7. pa. 102. in the open Market place, that the Image was made with ſuch a deuice, that at the pulling of a certaine ſtring the hand would mooue vp and downe. And the laſt, euery olde man and woman in the Countrie could tell to bee but a iuggling tricke of a crafty Prieſt, firſt anoynting the Image without, and then heating it within (for it was hollow) with a chafingdiſh of coales, from whence grew out that ſoueraigne and excellent ſweat.
               26. Thirdly, the Paynim plants a tree, and after cuts it downe, and with one part thereof hee warmes himſelfe, with another part he roſts his meate; and of the third hee makes himſelfe a God, as the Prophet Eſay ſaith, and when he hathEſay 44. 15. 16.

                  hly, the Paynims ſay, that Images were Elements or Letters toAthan. orat. con. Gentes. know God by, and they vſed Images and other ceremonies to procure the preſence of Angels, and celeſtiall powers: the Romaniſts ſay and doe the ſame; they ſay that Images are Lay-mens Bookes, and that their worſhip of them doth procure the fauour of thoſe heauenly things whoſe repreſentations they beare. Laſtly, Paynims put their truſt and affiance in their Idols: ſo doe the Romaniſts in their Images, as appeareth by the conſecration of them, and their Prayers vnto them: thus they conſecrate the Image of the bleſſed Virgin, Sanctifica, Deus, hanc formulam, &c. O God, ſanctifie this forme
                  In pontifical. 
                  of the bleſſed Virgin, that it may miniſter the ſuccour of wholeſome helpe to thy faithfull people, that hurtfull thunder and lightnings may be ſpeedily auoyded, inundations of waters, commotion of warre, &c. may be ſuppreſſed. Againe, thus they conſecrate the Image of Saint Iohn the Euangeliſt, Grant, that all which behold this Image with deuotion, and make their prayers before it, may be heard: for what neceſſity ſoeuer they pray, let this Image be a holy expulſion of deuils, an aduocation of Angels, a protection of the faithfull, &c. Why ſhould not affiance bee placed in theſe Images that are thus qualified? But beare their prayers; To the Image of

               Before the famous Image of the Lady of Lauretto, menTurſell. Ieſuit. de virg. Laur. and women of all ſorts fall downe and pray, when they are

in any danger, or extremity: to her they go a pilgrimage, and aſſoone as they come neere to the Towne of Lauretto, and behold the place where the Image is, they fall downe and worſhip, and ſo they doe againe at the Temple dore, and after in the Temple they humble themſelues in a moſt ſeruile and baſe manner: by all which it is euident, that they affie and truſt in the Image: as that Falkoner did, who being vpon the gallows ready to be hanged, for ſuſpition of conuaying away his Maſters Hawke, by onely conceiuing a prayer in his heart, vnto this Ladie of Lauretto, the Hawke came gingling in the ayre, and light vpon the gallowes, and ſo the poore man eſcaped the halter. He that will reade the fiue Bookes of Turſelline the Ieſuite, concerning this Lady, ſhall eaſily perceiue that ſhe is made a Goddeſſe amongſt them, and worſhipped with the very ſame worſhip which is due vnto God. And thus it is as cleare as the Sun, both by their doctrine and practice, that the Church of Rome by worſhipping of Images, is guilty of heatheniſh and abominable Idolatry.
               27. Concerning the Reliques of our Sauiour Chriſt and3. the Saints, whereof their Church hath infinite numbers, there is no leſſe Idolatry committed to them, then was before vnto Images. For firſt, ſome of them confeſſe, that Reliquiae eodem
                  Vaſq. de adorat. li. 3. diſ. 4. cap. 2. 
                  modo atque imagines ſunt adorandae, Reliques are to bee worſhipped after the ſame manner as Images. And therefore if there be Idolatrie in the one, it muſt alſo be needs in the other: for whether the worſhip be not to be reſtrained to the Image and Relique, but to be referred to the things whereof they are repreſentations and parts, as the forenamed Ieſuite thinkes, with ſome other: or whether it is to be confined to the matter of the Relique, and forme of the Image, without further relation, as Bonauenture, Aquinas, yea, and Bellarmine
                  Bona. 3. d. 9. art. 1. q. 4. Aquin. in 3. d. 9. q. 1. art. 1. Bell. de Imag. li. 2 
                        •
                     a. 21. himſelfe, with many other, ſeeme to auerre: yet it is Idolatry both waies, becauſe in both, religious worſhip is giuen to the Creatures, in the one ſimply, in the other reſpectiuely, which indeed ſome what qualifieth the heate of the diſeaſe, but doth not at all cure the roote of it.
               28. Secondly, others are of opinion, that there is greater

cauſe of worſhipping Reliques, then Images: for (ſay they) a man cannot worſhip an Image, but his thoughts muſt needs be caried vp to the contemplation of him whoſe Image it is, but reliquia ſolùm adorantur ratione contactus, quo ſunt quodammodo
                  Bona. Ibid. Aquin. Ibid. Marſil. in 3. q. 8. art. 2. Vaſques de adora. lib. 3. diſ. 4. c. 1 
                  ſanctificatae & conſecratae: Reliques are to be worſhipped, onely in reſpect of their touching of Chriſt, or the Saints, by which they are after a ſort ſanctified, and conſecrated, and therefore they may be worſhipped ſimply by themſelues, by reaſon of that ſanctification without Chriſt or the Saint, of whom they are ſaid to be ſanctified. Here the former qualification for Images is taken away from Reliques, and therefore the Idolatry is more groſſe, yea, in regard of this contaction, ſome of them are not aſhamed to ſay, that the very wormes of the bodies of the dead,
                  Vaſq. Ibid. l. 3. c. 8. nu. 114. are to be worſhipped with a right intention, and with a ſincere faith. Thirdly, not to ſtand vpon priuate opinions; the determination of their repreſentatiue Church, the CouncillConcil. Trident. Decret. de Reliq. Sanctor. of Trent, doth proue the worſhipping of Reliques to be Idolatry: for it doth not onely condemne thoſe which refuſe to giue worſhip and honour to them in any reſpect: but euen thoſe alſo, which opis impetrandae cauſa, To obtaine helpe by them, doenot honour them. Now hence thus I reaſon: to put our truſt and confidence in any creature, is Idolatry: but to ſeeke for helpe at the Reliques of Saints, is to repoſe truſt and confidence in creatures; therefore by neceſſary conſequence, the worſhip of Reliques is Idolatry, becauſe thereby they ſeeke for helpe; and ſo the Church of Rome is by the ſentence of their owne Councill, guilty of this foule ſinne: and this Councill of theirs, is guilty before God and man, of protecting, maintaining, and authorizing the ſame: a farre greater guilt then the former; by how much, according to the rules of Law, the Author of a ſinne is euer more guilty then the Actor.
               21. Fourthly, their practice doth make this more euident: for as Caſſander ingeniouſly confeſſeth, In theſe laſt times too
                  Caſſand. conſult. de venerat. Reliquiar. 
                  much is attributed to the Reliques and memories of Saints, in ſo much as the better ſort of men, and thoſe that were moſt zealous, haue placed the ſumme, and ſubſtance, as it were, of Religion, in
                  
                  ſearching out ſuch Reliques, adorning them with gold, and Iewels, and building temples and memorials for them; and the worſer and wickeder ſort haue repoſed falſe confidence in the fooliſh and ſuperfluous worſhipping of them. Here we ſ
                     •
                  e the practice both of the better and the worſer ſort of people, that is, indeed, of all for the moſt part, in the worſhip of Reliques; the one eſteeming it the chiefeſt part of Religion and piety; and the other relying wholly vpon it, as the onely meanes, for the purging away their ſinnes, and ſo an occaſion to harten them in the ſame, becauſe they thinke, as long as they performe this dutie, they may ſinne freely. If any man ſay, that the ignorance and miſdoings of ſome, is not to bee imputed as an errour to the Church: I anſwer, that it is not ſome, but all generally, for the moſt part, that are thus affected: and therefore Caſſander condemnes both good and bad, as guilty of this crime. But graunt, that many are otherwiſe minded; yet for all that, it cannot be denied, but the greater part are in this ranke: and that is inough to proue their Church Idolatrous, becauſe, according to the Logicall axiome, euery denomination is to be taken from the greater part; neither is it a perſonall errour, but a dogmaticall poſition deriued from the grounds of their Religion, as from the Councill of Trent, which alloweth to worſhip them, Opis impetrandae cauſa, for to obta ne helpe of them, and from the reſt of their great Diuines: Some of whom would haue them to bee worſhipped with the ſame worſhip with Images, ſome with a greater reuerence then Images ob contactum: and they that mince it fineſt, with a religious reuerence, which they call adoration and veneration: in all which is that, in a ſort, either openly or couertly allowed by their doctrine, which is practiſed by their people.
               30. But let vs ſearch a little further into their practice. The cuſtome of the Church of Rome, is to take the bodies, aſhes, or bones of Saints out of their graues, and to adorne them with gold, and ſiluer, ſilke, veluet, and ſuch like, and to carry them about in publike proceſſions, and ſupplications, and to ſhew them to the people, to be touched, kiſſed, gazed vpon, and adored as a ſingular and meritorious ſeruice

to God: is not this Idolatry? They teach, that God doth tye his grace and vertue to thoſe Reliques, whereof they are partakers, that adore them with due reuerence, and offer precious gifts vnto them: yea, they promiſe vnto ſuch many indulgences, and Pardons for ſinnes. Is not this Idolatry? Againe, they teach, that their prayers are better, and more effectuall, and acceptable vnto God, if they bee made before the Reliques of Saints, and therefore their practice is in times of neceſſity, to goe a pilgrimage to ſuch places, where the moſt famous Reliques are; becauſe they are perſwaded, that their prayers ſhall bee there ſooneſt heard of God: yea, they make men beleeue, that the Euchariſt hath a great deale of holineſſe added vnto it, if Reliques of Saints bee included within the Altar. Is not this Idolatry? They light vp candles, and ſet vp before them Tapers, which S. Ierome calleth Idolatriae
                  Hieron. Epiſt. ad Ripar. 
                  inſignia, the Enſignes of Idolatry, and cauſe them to burne, euen at noone day; and that as they ſay, in reſemblance of the golden candleſticke, which alwayes burnt before the Arke, Exod. 2. 5. but indeede rather in imitation ofExod. 2. 5. the heathen, who vſed to burne Tapers before their Images, in the Temples of their Gods: and therefore, me thinkes, it isBaruch. 6. 18. Virgil. Aenead. 1 Bel. de reliquiis, Sanct. l. 2. c. 3. ſtrange, that Bellarmine ſhould make this an argument why Reliques are to be worſhipped, becauſe Tapers and Candles are ſet vp before them: wheras rather he ſhould conclude, that Idolatry is cōmitted before them, becauſe of this. Againe, in their ſolemne oathes, they touch not onely the Bible, but the Reliques of Saints, & ſo deuide the religion of an oath, which is a principall part of Gods worſhip, betwixt God and them, againſt which a plague is denounced by the Prophet Zephany,

Mathew: at leaſt if it be Chryſostomes; He that ſweares by any thing beſide God, deifies that thing, and thereby makes himſelfe an Idolater. Is not this then Idolatry? Laſtly, whereas in former times, where leſſe ſuperſtition preuailed, they placed the Reliques of Saints vnder the Altar, as Ambroſe
                  Ambroſ. in Epiſt. ad Soror. witneſſeth of the Reliques of Geruaſins and Protaſius.
                  
                  Ille (Chriſtus videlicet) ſuper altare, qui pro omnibus paſſus eſt, iſti ſub altari qui ipſius redempti ſunt ſanguine. Chriſt was vpon the Altar, who ſuffered for all, the Reliques of them vnder the Altar, who were redeemed with his bloud: yet nowCaſſand. conſult. de Reliq. p. 162. (as Caſſander well notes) contrary to the ancient cuſtome, their practice is to place the bodies of Saints vpon the Altars, which place is only proper for the body of Chriſt. Is not this horrible Idolatry? And yet Bellarmine would hence proue,Bel. de Reliq lib. 2. c. 3. that they are to be worſhipped, becauſe they are placed vnder the Altar, becauſe (forſooth) the Altar is to be worſhipped: but what if the worſhipping of the Altar be Idolatry too, as without queſtion it is, if the Altar be a dead creature, and a heape of ſtones, or wood? This is to adde drunkenneſſe to thirſt, and to couer a filthy wound, with a more filthy plaiſter: beſides, the firſt bringers in of that cuſtome, though they placed them vnder the Altar in a religious manner: yet neuer meant, that they ſhould bee worſhipped by thoſe that approched vnto the Altar, or that they did conferre any ſanctity to the Euchariſt. Thus we haue a ſhort view of their ſuperſtitious and Idolatrous practice in this point.
               31. Fiftly and laſtly, that they may be voyd of all excuſe and pretext, an infinite number of their thus worſhipped Reliques, are meere falſe and counterfait; not true members, parts, or remainders of any Saints, but fained impoſtures of couetous Prieſts, and often the members not of men, but of baſer creatures. At this day (ſaith Caſſander) when the world ſeemeth
                  Caſſand. Ibid. 
                  to be full of Reliques, it may bee feared, leſt vpon diligent examination, moſt detestable frauds and impostures be found out, as it appeared ſometime to S. Martin, who found a place honoured in the name of an holy Martyr, to be the Sepulcher not of a Martyr, but of a wicked Robber. This kinde of couſonage beganAug. de oper. monach. cap 28. Gregor. lib. 3. Epiſt. &c. to ſpring in Augustine and Gregories times: for the one complaineth of certaine Hypocrites, that caried about, and boaſted of the members of Martyrs, ſi tamen Martyram, if ſo be they were Martyrs. And the other affirmeth, that certaine Greeke Monkes being found digging vp the dead bodies of men, in a certaine field of Rome, confeſſed that they meant to

carrie their bones into Greece, as the Reliques of Saints.
               32. But ſince Popery grew to perfection, this is alſo growne to ſuch a height of impudencie; that it is a wonder to heare what ſtrange Reliques are to bee ſeene in the world. S.

Nay further, beſides theſe three places, his head is reſerued in a fourth, to wit, in the Laterane Church at Rome, by Onuphrius teſtimony. And beſides this whole head, another piece of his head, in the Church of Saint Praxis; by the ſame Author: and in a fixt place, one of his iaw-bones, with his beard, is kept for a monument: this is at Poytiers in Fraunce, as witneſſeth Caluine: his teeth areCaluin. admonit. de Reliquijs. not confined to his iawes; nor yet at one place, but to bee ſeene in many places; at Rome in the Church of S.

               33. But S. Peter is not alone in this, for Chriſt himſelfe is abuſed: three praepuces, or foreskinnes of his are ſhowne,Caluin. de neceſſit. reformand.

Nay, there is ſcarce a Saint that is any thing famous,

to whom they do not faine two or three bodies. Saint Barbaries

Saint Apollonia had ſo many teeth, being all ſoueraigne medicinesAbbas Amelm. Chemnit. exam. Concil. Trident. de Reliquijs. for the tooch-ache, that when King Edward labouring of that diſeaſe, ſent through England, for all her teeth to be brought vnto him, two or three hogſheads could not hold them that were found out. It is reported and recorded of a certaine Relicke-monger that boaſted, that hee carried about in a box ſome feathers of the holie Ghoſt. Now, another merry companion ſtealing away theſe feathers, foiſted in, in their roome, certaine coales: The other not perceiuing the coozenage, the next day began to vaunt of his holy relickes, and to ſhew them to the people, which ſtood ready by to adore them with great reucrence: but when he opened his caske, he found nothing but coales: whereat, being nothing amazed, like a skilfull Artiſan, he turned Cat in the pan, and told the people, that thoſe coales were taken from vnder the Grediron of Saint Laurence, when he was broyled to death: thus any thing will ſerue their turnes for relickes, when need requireth: and ſo more then Aegyptian is the blindneſſe of the Popiſh crue, that they beleeue all to bee true, and take all this traſh for good ware.
               33. There is almoſt nothing that our Sauiour touched, or that touched him, or that hee had any thing to doe withall, but is turned into a Relicke: as the Manger wherein hee was laid at his birth, is to be ſeene in Rome at Saint Mary Maior: the Linnen cloth wherein he was ſwadled, at Saint Paul: and another piece at Saint Sauiour in Spaine: his Cradle and the Shirt which his mother made for him, at the ſame place: the Pillar which he leaned vnto, when hee diſputed with the Doctours, and the water-pot in which he turned water into wine, which are to be ſeene at diuers ſundry places, to wit, at Rauenna, at Piſa, at Andegauum, and in Spaine at Saint Sauiours, the Table which he eate his laſt Supper on, at Saint Iohn Laterane, a piece of the bread at Saint Sauiours in Spaine, the Knife where with he killed the Paſſeouer, at Treuers, the Cup

wherein he gaue the Sacrament of his bloud to bee drunke, at Saint Maries neere Lyons, which Cup alſo is to bee ſeene among the Heluians, in a certaine Monaſterie of the Auguſtine Friers: ſo the diſh wherein the Paſchall Lambe was put, is viſible at Rome, at Genua, and at Arles: ſo the to well wherwith he wiped his Apoſtles feet, is to be ſeene in Rome at S. Iohn Laterane, and yet the ſame is ſhewed at Aquae in Germanie, and at Saint Cornelius, with the marke of Iudas his foote imprinted in it: a piece of one of thoſe loaues wherewith Chriſt miraculouſly fed the multitude in the deſart, is yet extant at Rome, at Saint Maria Noua: and another piece at Saint Sauiours in Spaine.
               
               34. What ſhould I ſpeake of the Croſſe found out by Helena? whereof, as Hiſtories report, ſhe gaue one part to her Son Conſtantine, which was placed on a porphyrie pillar in Conſtantinople: and the other part encloſed in a ſiluer caſe, ſhee ſent to the Biſhop of Hieruſalem to be kept. It is admirable to ſee, into how many pieces and patches it is now ſubdiuided: one man was able to beare it ſixteene hundred yeares agoe: and now ſixteene men (nay, if I ſaid a hundred, it were not amiſſe) are ſcarce able to carry the fragments of it: yea, they would load a whole ſhip, and that of good burthen. The nailes, as I ſaid before, which were but three, as all know, haue ſpawned eleuen more, and are become foureteene, where of two are to be ſeene at Rome, one at Saint Hellens, another at Saint Croſſes, a third at 
                     Ʋenice, a fourth at Sene, a fift at Colne in Germanie at the three Maries, a ſixt at Treuers, a ſeuenth at S. Dennis in France, an eight at S. Sacell, a ninth with the Carmelites, a tenth among the Biturigions, an eleuenth in an Abby, &c. his crowne of thornes is diuided into ſo many portions, that either it muſt needs be of huge bigneſſe, or elſe ſome of thoſe fragments which are taken for parts of it, muſt needs be meere impoſtures: his ſeameleſſe Coat hath begot diuers others; for one is to be ſeene at Argentolium, another at Treuers, a third the Turke hath with him. I ſhould bee too long in this friuolous argument, if I ſhould reckon vp all the reliques of our Sauiour Chriſt that are notoriouſly extant,

and to all which, worſhip and adoration is performed.
               35. As for the Virgin Maries relicks, they are alſo very many and notable; her haire and her milke are reſerued in ſo many places, that neuer any woman gaue ſo much milke in all her time of bearing, as ſhe did in that time that ſhee gaue ſucke: her Smocke is had in great honour both at Carnutis, and alſo at Aquae in Germany, and is carried vpon the end of a pole to be worſhipped; it is of that bigneſſe, that the bleſſed Virgin ſhould ſeeme by it to haue been a woman of an incredible ſtature: which is the more to be wondred at, becauſe Ioſephs breeches, which are carried with the ſmocke in the ſame pompe, are ſo little, that they would fit a little boy or adwarfe: her Kerchiefes are to be ſeene, one at Treuers, another at Liſium in Italie: a little Croſſe-cloth of hers is at Bononia, her girdle at Pratum, and another at Monferrat, her Slippers at Saint Saniacquery, her Shoo at Sanfloridum, her Combes, one at Rome, another at 
                     Ʋeſontium, her marriage Ring is at Peruſium (as if then mariage was made with Rings, as it is at this day) her Garments, or at leaſt, pieces of them are to be ſeene at ſo many places, that the Virgin Maries wardrobe might compare (if all were hers) with the greateſt Princeſſe in the world; foure pictures are to be ſeen of her, which Saint Luke himſelfe drew.
               36. What ſhould I reckon vp the Relicks of other Saints, which are all of the ſame nature, though not number? Saint Michaels Sword and Buckler wherewith he ouercame the diuell, is a monument of great eſtimation, they are kept at great Saint Michaels in France, a place much frequented by Pilgrims. And what kind of things are they, thinke you? mary, the ſword is like a Childes dagger that hee weareth at his back, and his Buckler like a little cupping-glaſſe: or like the boſſe of a Bridle: fit weapons (without doubt) for an Archangell, and more fit for him to fight with the Diuell withall? What ſhould I ſpeake of the Relicks of Saint Iohn Baptiſt? breuity bids me paſſe them ouer: and yet I cannot chuſe but relate one or two which are moſt famous: as that finger of his wherewith he poynted vnto Chriſt, when he ſaid, Behold

the Lambe of God: this finger is multiplied; for it is to be ſeene at Veſontium, and at Tholoſſe, and at Lyons, and among the Bituriges, and at Florence, and neere Matiſcone. Behold a wonder, ſixe fingers on a hand, or elſe one finger begetting fiue more, and ſo turned into ſixe, both a like miraculous: one of his ſhooes is in Paris among the Carthuſians, behold here another miracle, it was ſtolne away vpon a time, and another of a ſodaine came in the roome thereof: ſure, a ſhoo will neuer bee wanting, as long as there be Shoo-makers in Paris.
               
               37. Such like are the relickes of the reſt of the Saints, as of Peter, and Paul, and Iohn, and Iames, with the other Apoſtles, the Popiſh Churches are repleniſhed with thē, and ſome of them are in diuers places at once, after a miraculous maner, as the Altar whereon Peter ſaid Maſſe, is both to bee viewed at Rome, and at Piſa, his ſtaffe is at Colne, and at Treuers. Andrew hath one bodie to be ſeene at Tholoſſe, and another at Melphis: Iames the leſſer, and Philip, haue each of them two bodies, one of them at Tholoſſe, another at Rome: ſo alſo haue Simon and Iude: Bartholomew is to be ſeene at Naples: and yet for all that, his body is at Rome too, in a Church dedicated vnto him. Mathew hath three bodies, one at Patauium, another at Rome at Saint Mary Maior, and a third at Treuers: the Cup wherein Iohn the Euangeliſt drunke the poyſon, after he was condemned by Domitian, is both at Bononia, and at Rome to be ſeene. Saint Anne hath three bodies, one at Apla, another at Prouince, and a third at Lyons: and ſo her head is in three places, at Treuers, at Turen, and at Thuring. Lazarus the Brother of Marie is like wiſe a Gyant of three bodies, one of them is at Maſſilia, another at Anguſtodune, and the third at Auelona.
               
               38. I
                     •
                   would fill a volume, if I ſhould reckon vp all their ſtrange relicks. Let him that deſireth to ſee more of them, reade Caluins Tractate, called Admonitio de Reliquijs, where he ſhall finde a whole thraue of them. I for this time end with three or foure braue ones for the nonce, which are worthy neuer to be forgotten. It is written of Dunſtane the Abbot

of Glaſtenbury, that as he was hallowing a certaine Church, he beheld the right thumbe of Editha, then Abbeſſe of Wilton,
                  Guiliel. Malmſbur. lib. 2. de Pontif. Vincent. lib. 25. cap. 33. as ſhee was croſſing and bleſſing her forhead, and much delighting therein, hee tooke it into his hand, and ſaid, Neuer might this thumbe periſh. By vertue of which prayer of his, after Edithaes death, when all her body was turned into aſhes, that thumbe, and another part of her body, which it ſeemeth, he had bleſſed too, were found ſafe and ſound, and ſo became Reliques. We read alſo of a certaine Monke, who gaue out,Verger. annot. in Catalog. haeret. an. 1559. fol. 17. that he had brought from the Eaſt ſome of the ſound of the Bels, which hung in Salomons Temple, and that he could ſhew among other Reliques, ſome of the haires which fell from the Seraphicall Angell, when hee came to imprint the fiue wounds of Chriſt in S. Frauncis body. Yea, ſome of them are not aſhamed to ſhew to the Pilgrimes that goe to Ieruſalem, a three cornerd ſtone, which they beare them in hand, is that very ſtone, whereof Dauid ſpake, ſaying, The ſtoneBellon. obſeruat. lib. 2. c. 85. which the builders refuſed, is the head of the corner. Laſtly, at Cour cheuerin neere vnto Blois, is kept for a monument the breath of S. Ioſeph, which he breathed, when he claue wood being a Carpenter: at Burgos in Spaine, is ſhewne a Crucifix, whoſe nailes and beard are cut euery moneth, they grow ſo faſt, and in theſe excrements, they ſay, is great vertue. At Rome is to bee ſeene the fore-skinne of our Sauiour, which was cut off at his circumciſion: and in Galicia (as Pilgrimes report) are preſerued ſome of the feathers of certaine chickens, which are of the race of that Cocke, which crowed when Peter denied his Maſter. And at S. Denis, is to bee ſeene the Lanthorne which Iudas caried in his hand, when he came to betray his Maſter, with a number other ſuch like. Theſe bee their goodly Reliques which they would haue men to worſhip with ſuch great deuotion: of all which, or at leaſt, of moſt of them, we may truly auouch that which Augustine ſaith of miracles, that they are vel figmenta mendacium hominum, vel
                  Auguſt, de vnitat. Eccleſ.

in ſuperſtition, and to line their owne purſes with crownes.
               39. The bare narration of them is ſufficient to bewray their falſhood, but much more the Logicall contrariety and naturall repugnancie that is among them, which all the wit of man is not able to reconcile. And laſt of all, their nouelty for moſt of theſe Reliques, was neuer heard of in this world for three hundred yeeres aft

Mathew vpon his breſt. I anſwere: that though all theſe were true, yet they were not reuealed to that end that they ſhould be worſhipped: neither yet did the God of truth euer by his teſtimony bolſter out ſuch notorious lyes as are found in the Romiſh Reliques. We may confidently therefore conclude, that moſt abominable Idolatry is committed in the Church of Rome, by the worſhipping (at leaſt) of falſe Reliques, whereof there is ſuch a ſwarme: for the greateſt part of their Reliques being counterfait, the greateſt part of the worſhip which is done vnto them, muſt needes be Idolatry.
               40. The Ieſuites, to this obiection of ours, giue two anſweres; one is Bellarmines, who flatly denieth the ReliquesBell. de Eccleſ. triumph. li. 2 c. 4 in Churches to be counterfait, becauſe none are receiued but by the authority of the Biſhop of Rome. And as for the multiplicity of bodies, hee ſaith, that the parts of them are often found in diuers places, and by a figure of ſpeech, are called by the name of the whole. But the Ieſuites anſwere, by his leaue, is idle and friuolous: for firſt, all theſe fore-named falſe Reliques are not caried about by priuate men, but found in their Churches; and therefore if authorized by the Popes holineſſe, the more ſhame for him, and the more certainty for vs, that he can erre like a ſinfull man, euen ſitting in his chaire of doctrine. And

ſecondly, though it were true which he ſaith, concerning the bodies of Saints, yet it cannot hold in other things, as in Iohn Baptists finger and his ſhooe, and the nailes of Chriſts croſſe, and the Virgin Maries milke, and ſuch like. Therefore Vaſques

                        •
                     t lib. 3. cap. 8. diſp. 3. the Ieſuite hath deuiſed another anſwere, and that is, Though the Reliques be vncertaine and falſe, yet if they bee worſhipped, it is no ſinne, but a good worke, Becauſe, as it is not the ſinne of Idolatry (ſaith hee) to worſhip a beame of light, vnder which the diuell lurketh, when a man taketh it for Chriſt: ſo if a man worſhip a falſe Relique, ſuppoſing it to bee ſome true part of a Saint, Merito ſuae deuotionis non caret, He wanteth not the merit of his deuotion. But this anſwere is not onely friuolous, but impious: for by the ſame reaſon the Iewes ſhould be cleared from ſinne, when they crucified Chriſt, becauſe S. Paul ſaith, they did it through zeale, though not according to knowledge, Rom. 19. 2. and the Gentiles, whenRom. 19. 2. they put Chriſtians to death, becauſe our Sauiour ſaith, that in ſo d
                     •
                  ing, they thought they did God good ſeruice, Iohn
                  Ioh 16. 2. 16. 2. but they both ſinned notwithſtanding moſt grieuouſly. And their owne rule is, that ignorantia non excuſat à toto, ſed à tanto, that is, ignorance doth not excuſe the whole fault committed, but onely leſſens the guilt of it. I conclude therefore, that notwithſtanding all that can be ſaid, yet in the worſhipping of Reliques, is committed manifeſt and deteſtable Idolatry.
               41. Neuertheleſſe, we proteſt againſt the ſlanders of our aduerſaries, that albeit wee abhorre all falſe and counterfait Reliques, and refuſe to worſhip with adoration thoſe that are true: yet for theſe laſt ſort, when they are certainely knowne vnto vs, wee giue vnto them a due honour and reuerence: that is, wee confeſſe them to bee holy as the members of Chriſt, and Temples of the holy Ghoſt, if they bee the parts of Saints and Martyrs: wee ſay with S. Augustine, That their
                  Aug. de ciuit. lib. 8. c. vlt. 
                  memories are to be celebrated to the end (not that they may be worſhipped but) that thankes may be giuen to God for their victories, and we may be ſtirred vp to the imitation of their crownes, by calling vpon God to our helpe. We acknowledge with Caſſander,
                  
that Vowes and Pilgrimages vnto places, famous forCaſſand. conſult. de reliquijs. the Relickes of Martyrs, were in olde time profitable, Whileſt that the memory of the Martyrs was yet freſh and certaine, and as long as God by vndoubted myracles did manifeſt, that their ſoules did liue, who were thought to bee dead: and whileſt all theſe things were referred to this end, that the Chriſtian faith which they by dying profeſſed, might bee confirmed (as it were) by theſe ſignes. Yea, we affirme with Agrippa, that as

The fourth maine arme of Idolatry iſſuing out of the4. body of the Romiſh Church, and the roote of their religion is, their doctrine and practice touching the Inuocation of Saints and Angels. They maliciouſly ſlaunder vs, and ſay, that we are enemies to the Saints, and that we deny them all honour and reuerence, comparing vs therefore to the Caianian and Eun

                  ian Heretickes, for our wicked and ſacrilegious contempt of the Saints of God, as they falſly affirme: but we returne this reproch vpon themſelues, and confidently affirme, that they wrong the bleſſed Saints more in making

them Idols, and giuing them more honour then is their due, then we doe in giuing them too little, if that were true that we did ſo: for what can be more iniurious to the honour of thoſe bleſſed Creatures, who liue in the preſence of God, and ſing Haleluiah to him continually, with all honour,

                  praiſe, and glory be aſcribed to him that ſitteth vpon the Throne, and to the Lambe for euermore: whoſe chiefe ioy and delight is to aduance the honour of the eternall God, then to haue any part of that honour due vnto him aſcribed vnto them? they had rather be deueſted of all theirs, then any iot of his glory ſhould be diminiſhed. More iniurious therefore are they to the Saints, if they giue them too much, and that in derogation from God, then we, if we giue them too little.
               43. But wee deny that wee giue them too little; wee giue them their due honour and reſpect. For firſt, we giue God thankes for them, and for the benefits which God vouchafed by them to his Church; as the Church glorified God for the conuerſion of Saint Paul, and Paul gaue God thankes for theGal. 1. 13. graces of the Theſſalonians. Secondly, we highly extoll and1. Theſ. 1. 2. commend the Saints departed, and magnifie the graces and gifts of God in them; wee account them bleſſed, as the Virgin Marie propheſied of her ſelfe, that all Nations ſhould call her bleſſed: And wee keepe a perpetuall and a reuerend remembranceLuke 1. 48. of them, as our Sauiour promiſed to that Marie, that powred the boxe of precious oyntment vpon his head,Marke 14. 9. Prou. 10. 6. And Salomon confirmeth alſo to all the iuſt, that their memoriall ſhould be bleſſed. And thirdly, we propound them as examples for imitation, that their vertues may bee as patternes for vs to imitate, and their falls as markes to make vs warie: and their conuerſation as guides and directions for vs in the way to the heauenly Canaan. Thus much honour we willingly attribute vnto the Saints: but no further dare we goe, leſt we derogate from the honour of God; and in ſo doing, not pleaſe or content, but vexe and grieue the bleſſed Saints, who caſt downe their Crownes; that is, ſtrippe themſelues of all honour,Reuel. 4. 10. before the Throne of him that liueth for euer. But the Church of Rome are ſo lauiſh and prodigall in their honouring

of them, that they deſpoyle God of his honour, and inueſt them therewith, committing Idolatry vnto them. And this they doe three waies principally, firſt by outward adoration; ſecondly, by inuocation; and thirdly, by repoſing their truſt and confidence in their merites and mediation.
               44. Touching outward adoration, which conſiſteth in theſe things principally, to wit, in bowing the knee, proſtrating the body, dedicating Temples, conſecrating Feſtiuall daies, and making vowes to the Saints departed; all whichBell de cultu Sanct. lib. 3. outward worſhip the Romiſh Church alloweth, and the Popiſh crue affoord vnto the Saints departed: it cannot by any meanes bee eſteemed any whit leſſe then a practice of Idolatry, ſeeing by their owne confeſſion, it is more then a ciuill adoration, and being more then ciuill, it muſt needes be religious: for there are but two kinds of worſhip commanded by the law of God, the one enioyned in the firſt Table, namely, the diuine worſhip of God: and the other in the firſt commandement of the ſecond Table, which is the honour wee ought to giue to our ſuperiours. Now this worſhip of Saints muſt of neceſſity be one of theſe: but it is more then ciuill (ſay they) therefore it muſt needes bee a religious and diuine worſhip. For thus I reaſon, This worſhipping of Saints is either an iniunction of the firſt Table, or of the ſecond, or of neither: if they ſay, Of the firſt, then it is diuine and religious worſhip, for the firſt Table of the Law containeth vnder it onely diuine and religious duties, the obiect whereof is God himſelfe, and none other, as the ſeuerall precepts thereof doe declare: if they ſay, Of the ſecond, then it is meere ciuill and politike, for the ſecond Table is onely a bond of ciuill duties: if they ſay, It is of neither, thē it muſt needs be a wil worſhip, deui

               45. But to the poynt: I ſay, that ſeeing by the rule of

Gods word, we find but two kinds of worſhip, one religious and diuine, contained in the firſt Table; the other ciuill and humane, inioyned in the ſecond: If therefore the worſhip of Saints be not a meere ciuill worſhip, belonging to the ſecond Table of the Law, then it muſt needes be religious, and pertaine to the fi

In which words it is plaine, that the kinde of the worſhip exhibited to Saints triumphant, and Saints militant, is all one, but the extenſion of it is greater to the one then the other, according to t

                  n of gifts and graces, more apparent in one then the other.
               46. But the Romiſh Doctours, and principally the Ieſuites, adde a third kinde of worſhip, yea, a fourth to theſe two; albeit therein they neither agree with themſelues, nor with their fellowes, as it commonly falleth out when men build vpon their owne fancies, (a rotten foundation) and not vpon the word of God, which is the ground of truth. For Bellarmine
                  Bell. de Sanctor. beat. li. 1. ca. 12. ſaith, that there is a ciuill worſhip due vnto men, for ſome ciuill reſpect: and there is a religious worſhip due vnto Saints, in reſpect of their Sanctity and holineſſe, which he calleth dulia; and a diuine worſhip proper onely vnto

God, which he calleth latria: and that middle hee ſubdiuideth into two degrees; the firſt, he ſaith, is dulia, propriè dicta, ſo properly called, which agreeth to the Saints; and the ſecond Hyperdulia, which belongeth onely to the humanity of Chriſt, and the bleſſed Virgin his Mother: and ſo hee maketh foure diſtinct kinds of worſhip, whereof two are without the compaſſe and reach of Gods Commandements, and therefore I know not where to place them, except in the diuels. The like doctrine is deliuered by

                     Ʋaſques, that it is one and the ſame kind of worſhip wherewith wee honour men, aduanced in ciuill dignity, and the Saints; and that the difference is in the degrees of proportion, not in diuerſity of kind. And in this they fully conſent with vs, as alſo with Saint Auguſtine, and with the truth; but this is contradicted by Bellarmine, Vaſques, and all the rabble of the Ieſuites, as may appeare in the places before quoted.
               47. Paluda nus makes three kindes of Hyperdulia, the firſt due to the humanity of Chriſt, for it ſelfe; the ſecond, to thevaſq. Ibid. bleſſed Virgin; & the third, to the reſt of the Saints: but as for dulia, that he applyeth onely to that honour which we owe to all reaſonable creatures, except the damned: but this is croſſed by all the reſt. Againe, Durandus (as Vaſques reporteth) is of opinion, that the worſhip of Saints departed, and men, in ciuill dignity, proceedeth from one and the ſame vertue,Vaſq. Ibid. and differeth onely in the act applyed vnto the degrees of excellency. But Bellarmine, Vaſques, and all of that ſtampe, renounce vtterly that opinion, as I haue ſhewed. Laſtly, Vaſques that acute Ieſuite, as they brag of him, affirmeth, that the worſhip of Saints is not an act of Religion: and yet in the ſame Chapter he calleth it cultus ſacer & religioſus, A holy
                  
                  and religious worſhip; then which, what can be more contradictory? for if it be a religious worſhip, then muſt it needs be a worſhip of religion, and an act of religion; and if no worſhip of religion, then no religious worſhip: for coniugata (by the rule of Logicke) ſe inuicem ponunt & tollunt. And that which i
                     •
                   to bee noted aboue all the reſt, hee is conſtrained to deuiſe a new ſpeciall habite of vertue, to which this worſhipVaſq. Ieſ. Ibid. of Saints may be referred, neuer heard of before, neither in Morall Philoſophy, nor yet in diuinity: and that without name, and ſo without nature and being, except in the Ieſuites braine onely. Thus wee may ſee how errour, like Proteus, turneth it ſelfe into many ſhapes, and at laſt is ſtrangled with it owne halter.
               48. But that this outward adoration of Saints departed is Idolatrous, appeareth ouer and aboue that which hath beene ſaid, by theſe reaſons: firſt, becauſe they aſcribe vnto them a preſence, not onely in one place, but in all places where they are worſhipped: ſecondly, a power of hearing, ſeeing, and helping: and thirdly, an ability of knowing and ſeeing the heart: all which imply an infinite power, and ſuch as is properly diuine. And therefore it is nothing but a vaine ſhift, when they ſay they giue diuine worſhip to God, and no more but a certaine kinde of ſeruice to the Saints, when in truth they giue that which is Gods to the Saints, beſides touching, kneeling, and proſtrating the body in a religious manner. Peter
                  Acts 10. 26. refuſed to haue it done vnto him by Cornelius: and the Angell rebuked Iohn twice for offering it vnto him: if it hadReuel. 19. 22. beene lawfull, ſure, they would not haue refuſed it; for neither did Cornelius take Peter to be a God, but for a holy man: nor Iohn, the Angell for the Creator, but for an excellent creature, as euidently appeareth in the Texts; and therefore they intended not to worſhip them as Gods: yet becauſe the manner of their worſhip was more then befitting a creature, hauing in it a touch of diuine worſhip and religion, therfore it was reiected; the one ſaying, Stand vp, for I my ſelfe am a man; inſinuating, that a man muſt not bee religiouſly adored: and the other, See thou doe it not, for I am thy fellow
                  
                  ſeruant, implying thereby, that Angels, and if Angels, then Saints are but our fellow-ſeruants, and therefore not to bee worſhipped with any part of diuine and religious worſhip.
               49. To the example of Peter, Bellarmine and Vaſques
                  Bell. de Sanctor. beat li. 1. ca. 14. Voſques de adorat. li. 1. diſ. 5. c. 3 giue two anſwers, the one out of Hierom in his Booke againſt Vigilantius, that Cornelius was worthily corrected by Peter, becauſe he thought ſome diuine thing to be in him aboue othermen: the other out of Chryſoſtome vpon this place, that it was no fault in Cornelius to exhibite, but modeſty in Peter to refuſe that honour which was due vnto him. Bellarmine is in different which of theſe two anſwers we take; and therefore without propounding his owne iudgement, leaues thē to our choyce. and yet the one of them ouer-turneth the other; for Hierom ſaith, it was a fault in Cornelius; Chryſoſtome, that it was no fault: Hierom, that Peter did well in reprouing Cornelius; Chryſoſtome, that he did not reprooue him at all, but of modeſty refuſed the honour giuen to him. What reaſon had he to leaue theſe to our choyce, being thus contrary? It plainely ſheweth, that he knew not what to anſwere. Therefore 
                     Ʋaſques the Ieſuite renounceth Hieroms anſwere vpon this ground, that Cornelius knew the true God, before Peter came vnto him, and therefore could not erre ſo groſſely, as to aſcribe any diuinity to a mortall man, and inſiſts vpon Chryſoſtomes, that hee did it for modeſty ſake: but by as good warrant we may reiect Chryſoſtome, as he doth Hierom: eſpecially, ſeeing our reaſon is as effectuall; for Peter giues this reaſon of his denyall, for I my ſelfe am a man: which muſt needs be the medium of a ſillogiſme, thus to be concluded: No religious worſhip is to be giuen to man; but I my ſelfe am a man, therefore thou doeſt euill to worſhip me. Here is not a ſtrayning at courteſie for modeſty ſake, but a plaine renunciation of Cornelius his ſact as vnlawfull: if it had been a tricke of modeſty onely, he ſhould rather haue ſaid thus comparatiuely, I am not worthy of this honour from ſuch a man as thou art, or ſuch like: but in ſaying, I my ſelfe am but a man, he inſinuateth, that Cornelius did more then he ought to do.
               50. If they ſay, I but though you thus eſcape from Chryſoſtome,
                  
yet Hieroms interpretation will hold you faſt: I anſwere, Beſides Vaſques reaſon whereby he reiecteth Hierom, that it maketh nothing againſt vs, but for vs rather, & againſt them, becauſe Hierom ſeemeth to condemne as idolatrous, all ſuch adoration of Saints, wherein any part or propertie of the diuine nature is attributed vnto them: but the Romaniſts in kneeling and proſtrating their bodies to the Saints, aſcribe the properties of God vnto them, to wit, either to be preſent in many places at once, o

                   to heare, being as farre remote from them as

                  en is from earth, and to know the heart, and to haue power to helpe, &c. all which properly are proper vnto God.
               51. To the example of Iohn and the Angell, the former two Ieſuites oppoſe alſo a double anſwere: firſt, that the Angell did appeare vnto Iohn in that maieſty, that he might bee thought to be Chriſt himſelfe: And therefore that Iohn was rebuked, not for the errour in his adoration, but for his errour in the perſon adored. This anſwere Vaſques names onely, and then reiects as friuolous: But Bellarmine propounds it as good and authenticall. Which ſhall we beleeue in this caſe? Ma
                     •
                  y, ſauing his reuerence, though hee be now a Cardinall, the plaine Ieſuite is to be preferred before him, both becauſe this anſwere is croſſed and contradicted by the ſecond; and alſo, becauſe the Ieſuite giues a reaſon of his reiection. And the Cardinall goeth to it by downe-right authority, as if, becauſe he is their chiefe Rabbi, hee may ſay what hee liſt: his reaſon is, becauſe Iohn did truely know him to be an Angell, and not God, and therefore that there was no errour in the perſon. Secondly, they anſwere, that the Angell would not now, as in time before, be worſhipped of men, becauſe now God was become man, and by his incarnation brought ſuch dignity to the nature of man, that the very Angels ſhould doe reuerence vnto it, not be adored and reuerenced by it; eſpecially of Chriſts Apoſtles, and Princes of the Church. To which I anſwere, firſt, that by this allegation it muſt needes follow, that Angels are not now to bee adored in the Church of Chriſt, howſoeuer they were before; which is contrarie to

their owne doctrine, and generall tenent of their religion.Bell. de Sanctor. be

                     •••
                  ly, the reaſon where with the Angell, after he had reproued Iohn, directeth him to the right obiect of religious worſhip, doth ouerthrow this expoſition: for he ſaith, Worſhip God: he doth not ſay, Forbeare to worſhip me, becauſe your nature is dignified by the incarnation of the Sonne of God: but forbeare, becauſe I am not God; and all diuine and religious worſhip belongeth vnto him. And thus notwithſtanding all that is yet ſaid, all religious kneeling and proſtrating the body to the Saints, is Idolatrous.
               52. As for the dedicating Temples, conſecrating Feſtiuall daies, making vowes to them, they are all within the ſame compaſſe, and that partly for the reaſons before ſpecified, being acts of a religious worſhip: but eſpecially, becauſe theBell. decult. Sanct. li. 3. c. 4. & lib. 3. ca 9. & cap. 16. Idem, Ibid. ca. 4. doctrine of their Church is, that theſe things are ſo properly directed vnto the Saints, that the end of their conſecration is determined in them. And therefore Bellarmine reprooues their opinion, which ſay, that Temples cannot properly bee erected to any, but to God: and affirmeth, that they may be dedicated directly vnto Saints, and that vowes may bee made to them determinately; and ſo alſo Holy daies conſecrated: which cannot be any leſſe then plaine Idolatrie: ſeeing, as Saint Auguſtine ſaith, Cuiconuenit Templum, ei conuenit
                  Aug. de ciuit. lib. 22 ca. 10. 
                  ſacrificium, to whom a Temple, to him a Sacrifice belongeth. And ſeeing the Scripture in many places teſtifieth, that vowsNumb. 30. 3. Deut. 23. 21. Eſay 19. 21. muſt onely be made to God; I am not ignorant of their cuaſion, that they doe not dedicate Churches to Saints, as they are Temples; but as they are Baſilicae, that is, ſtately buildings for memorials of the Saints: and that a Vow is made to God in ſignum gratitudinis 
                        •

                     rum, as a ſigne of our thankfulnes to God the authour, and firſt cauſe of all good things: but to the Saints, as a ſigne of gratefulneſſe towards our mediatours and Interceſſours, by whoſe meanes wee receaue benefits from

God. And that the honour of the holy day, though it immediately pertaineth to the Saints, yet mediately and ſecondarily it amounteth to God.
               53. Theſe be Bellarmines goodly, but ſcarce godly diſtinctions: for theſe, and ſuch like as theſe are, hee vſeth as engines to vndermine the truth, and as vizards to couer the face of vgly falſhood. But they may well bee ouerthrowne with this one blaſt, that the holy Scripture neuer taught them, neither haue they any warrant from Gods Spirit: and therefore they are rather to be accounted forgeries of a frothy wit, then fruits of truth. But let vs examine them a little: A Church is dedicated to God as it is a Temple; and to a Saint, as it is a Baſilica, Why then it ſeemeth, that either ſometimes it is a Temple, and ſometimes not a Temple, according to the fancie of thoſe that approach vnto it: or elſe it is alwaies a Temple, and yet alwaies a Baſilica too, and then the honour muſt be diuided betwixt God and the Saints: let them take which they will; the firſt is impiety, the ſecond Idolatry. Againe, for Vowes, though we vow chiefly vnto God, and ſecondarily to the Saints; yet the ſame worſhip in nature is giuen to theſe as to him, onely it is not in the ſame degree: but Idolatry is to afford any part of Gods worſhip to a creature, as hath beene ſhewed. And laſtly, touching feaſt daies; if they be immediately applied to the honour of the Saint, and in a mediate and ſecondarie reſpect to God, as his diſtinction importeth, then the creature is adored not onely with the like worſhip in nature, but with a higher degree then God himſelfe. And thus the miſt which he ſeeketh to caſt ouer mens eyes, by the ſubtiltie of his diſtinctions, is quickly diſpelled, aſſoone as the light of truth ſheweth it ſelfe: and therefore as Ixion, imbracing a cloud, in ſtead of Iuno, beg at a monſtrous off-ſpring: ſo, the entertaining of thoſe cloudie diſtinctions, without deciphering them to the quicke, hath bred, and doth breed moſt of thoſe monſtrous errors in the Church of Rome. Thus we ſee, that this outward adoration is tainted with moſt groſſe Idolatrie.
               54. The ſecond branch of their Idolatrie to the Saints, is,

by Inuncation and Prayer directed vnto them. For, Prayer is a proper and peculiar part of Gods worſhip, and therefore not to be giuen to any other beſides, without a plaine touch of Idolatry: for the commandement of God is in the OldePſal 5

Againe, it is the commandement of our Sauiour Chriſt in the New Teſtament to his whole Church, that it ſhould thus pray, O, our Father, not, O, our mother, nor, O, our brother, nor, O, our ſiſter, nor, O, our fellow-ſeruants, as the Popiſh Church prayeth: but, O, our Father. If there had been any neceſſity of praying to Saints, ſure, our Sauiour would here haue preſcribed it, where he ſetteth downe a perfect forme of prayer to be vſed in his Church for euer.

                  ending to this end; neither is there ſo much as one precept or example in the whole Booke of God, that either inioyneth or approueth Inuocation of Saints, as Caſſander confeſſeth; albeit his inference therevponCaſſand. conſult. art. 21. is abſurd, that therefore it may be done, becauſe, as there is no mandate nor example extant to warrant it, ſo there is no prohibition to interdict it: as if it were not neceſſarily required, that as all our actions, ſo our prayers ſhould bee grounded vpon faith, without which it is not onely impoſſible

                  y of ſpirit, and euill ſucceſſe, I ſhall not neede to ſhew, being ſufficiently diſcouered by others, and the very fight of them being a ſufficient refutation.
               56. As for his reaſon which he braggeth to be vnanſwerable, me thinkes, it halts of all foure: for, becauſe we entreat Gods children here in this world to pray for vs, doth it thereforeBell. de Sanctor. beat. li. 1. ca. 19. follow that we muſt pray vnto them, being departed out of this world? By the ſame reaſon it may bee inforced, that we ought to giue almes vnto them, and entertaine them into our houſes, and waſh their feete, and comfort them, and aduiſe them, and preach vnto them: for all theſe duties of charity wee performe to Saints militant. If they ſay, Why, but they are remooued from vs, and alſo from their bodies; and therefore as they ſtand not in neede of our charity, ſo wee cannot extend it vnto them: The ſame anſwere cutteth the throte of this argument, they are ſo farre exalted aboue vs, and ſeuered from all commerce with our affaires, that though we vſed their prayers here on earth, yet it is in vaine to inuocate them in heauen, our prayers, as our deeds of charity, being not able to ſtretch ſo farre. This I take to be a ſufficient ſolution to that vnſoluble argument: Albeit, we haue alſo another anſwere in readineſſe, to wit, that there is not the ſame reaſon of the inuocation of Saints in heauen, as of the mutuall prayers of Gods children on earth, but a great difference; here we know one anothers neceſſities, there the Saints knowEſay 63. 16. 2. Reg. 22. 20. not our wants; here we are preſent with them whom we requeſt to pray for vs; but we are not preſent with the Saints in heauen, nor they with vs; and therefore the one is a fruite of charity, but the other a practice of piety and religion: here one liuing man may requeſt anothers helpe by word of

mouth or letter: but inuocation of Saints is often performed by the ſecret deſires of the heart, without the vtterance of any ſpeech: here we ſtand as fellow members in our prayers, and make requeſt for each other, not in our owne names, but in the name of Chriſt our Mediatour: but when men inuocate the Saints in heauen, they make them more then their fellowes, euen mediatours of interceſſion betweene them and God. Laſtly, for mutuall praying for one another here, wee haue both an expreſſe commandement, and plaine examples in the word of God; but for praying to the Saints, wee haue neither commandement, nor example, nor promiſe in the whole Scripture.
               57. But that I may leaue theſe things, and come to the poynt in hand, that Saints are made Idols by inuocation, may appeare by theſe reaſons: Firſt, becauſe they aſcribe vnto them an omnipotent power to know the heart, which is a peculiar property belonging vnto God onely, Ier. 17. 10.Ier. 17. 10. Secondly, an infinite preſence in all places, and that at once: for when one prayeth to Saint Peter at Rome, another at Paris, another at London, another at Conſtantinople, and all at one inſtant, muſt not he needs be preſent in all thoſe places, or elſe how can he heare their prayers? Thirdly, a diuine power to helpe and deliuer all thoſe that call vpon them, and that not onely from outward calamities, but from inward ſinnes and corruptions. Fourthly, a property belonging onely vnto God, namely, to bee beleeued in: for how ſhall they call vpon him in whom they haue not beleeued, ſaith S. Paul, Rom. 10. 14?Rom. 10. 14. And laſtly, a diuine worſhip, which is ſacrifice for prayer, is a ſpiritual ſacrifice of Chriſtians. Heb. 13. 13. which, as all know,Heb. 13. 13. Mal. 1. 11. 1. Tim 2. 8. Aug. de ciuit. li. 8 cap. 27. pertaineth onely vnto God. And as Saint Auguſtine well confeſſeth, when he ſaith, We doe not ordaine Prieſts, nor offer ſacrifices to the Martyrs, becauſe it is vnfit, vndue, and vnlawfull, and due onely to God alone: and againe in the ſame Chapter, becauſe not they, but their God is our God.
               
               58. Againſt theſe arguments our aduerſaries make a ſhew of oppoſition (and but a ſhew) after this manner: Firſt, that they doe not aſcribe to the Saints an omnipotent power, or

an infinite preſence by inuocating them; for they ſay, Beatifica
                  Bell. de Sanctor. beat. li. 1. ca. 20. 
                  viſione, by that bleſſed viſion of God, they doe behold all things which pertaine vnto them to know in him, tanquam
                  Coſter. Enchir. 
                  in ſpeculo, as it were in a glaſſe. Secondly, that the Saints helpe, not as Authours, but as inſtruments and impetrators. Thirdly, that wee may beleeue in them, though not as in God, but as in our Patrons and Protectours. And that Bellarmine proueth by Hierome vpon the Epiſtle to Philemon,
                  Philem. 1. 5. on theſe words, When I heare of thy loue and faith which thou haſt towards the Lord Ieſus, and towards all Saints. Laſtly, that Prayer is an improper kind of ſacrifice, ſo called by a figure of ſpeech, and not ſo, being in it owne nature.
               59. But all theſe are but meere ſhifts, which may in ſome ſort blanch the fouleneſſe of this errour to the dim eyes of the ignorant; yet thoſe that are quicke-ſighted, can eaſily diſcerne their falſhood: and therefore that I may a little diſcouer their iuggling, I anſwere to their obiections in order; to the firſt three things: Firſt that t
                     •
                   is glaſſe, in which all things are ſaid to be ſeene, is no where to be found in the Scripture, and therefore is a plaine forgerie of their owne braines: for we reade, Mat. 5. 8. That the pure in heart are therefore
                  Mat 5. 8. 
                  bleſſed, becauſe they ſhall ſee God. From whence it may be gathered, that Viſio beatifica eſt beatitudo videntium: In the bleſſed ſight of God conſiſts the happineſſe of the Saints: but that thereby they ſhould behold, as it were in a glaſſe, all things which they would, is no where to be ſound in the Scripture of God. Secondly, it is contrary to Scripture: for Reuel. 6. 9.Reuel. 6. 9. it is ſaid, that the Saints vnder the Altar cry, How long, Lord, holy and true, wilt thou not reuenge our bloud! and Acts 2. 7. ItActs 2. 7. is not (
                     •
                  aith our Sauiour-to his Apoſtles) in you to know the times and ſeaſons, which the Father hath put in his owne power. And that this is meant not onely of the Saints in this life, but alſo in heauen, appeareth by that which Chriſt 
                     •
                  aith, Mat. 24. 23. that the Angels know not the houre of the laſt Iudgement: & if not the Angels, much leſſe the Saints: but all theſe things doe in ſome ſort pertaine vnto thē as well as the prayers of the liuing: and yet it is plaine, that they ſee them

not in that glaſſe. Thirdly, if that be certaine, that they ſee in this glaſſe the prayers and neceſſities of their ſuppliants; Why doth Coſter and others affirme, that they attaine this knowledgeCoſter Enchir. by the relation of Angels? and yet they aſſigne to euery man but one Angell: ſurely, that Angel is well employed in aſcending and deſcending euery houre to carry newes to the Saints. And why doe others ſay, that the Saints are after a ſort by a wonderfull celerity of their glorified nature in euery place? This is a wonderfull celerity indeed, if it were poſſible for them to be ſo; and yet be it as they would haue it, it cannot euince an audience of thoſe prayers which are made at one and the ſame inſtant, in diuers and farre diſtant places. And laſtly, why doe ſome others affirme, that they haue this knowledge not by the viſion of God, but by ordinarie and continuall reuelation from God? If by viſion, then not by reuelation: and if by reuelation, then not by viſion. And thus, like men in the darke, they fight with one another, and whileſt they forſake the light of the truth which ſhineth in the word of God, they fall into grieuous errours, hammered out of their owne fancies if they ſay it is no matter how they know our wants▪ but certaine it is that they doe know them: they take that for granted which is the queſtion to be proued, & which by no ſufficient argument they can euince.

To the ſecond obiection I anſwere, that moſt ignorant perſons eſteeme the Saints, to whom they pray, as the very authours and giuers of thoſe good things which they pray for, without any reſpect vnto God, ſaue that they thinke hee hath put them into their hands to bee diſtributed at their pleaſure; and therefore they pray to one for their Horſes, and to another for their Hogs, and to a third for their Kine, &c. Yea, not onely the ſimple ſort doe this, but it is the doctrine of their Church, as may appeare by this rime in their authorized Seruice-Bookes, to the bleſſed Virgin.
               
                  In te pluit, inte fluit Deus ſuam gratiam:
                  Ergo tuanobis plu

                      gratiae clementiam:

                  Et cunctorum delictorum confer indulgentiam.
                  
                     
                     That is: God raines his grace abundantly on thee:
                  Of that thy grace let vs partakers bee:
                  Bring vs vnto the preſence of thy Sonne,
                  And pardon all the ſinnes which we haue done.
               
               Here the Virgin Marie is not made the Impetrator, but the giuer of grace: and ſo are the reſt of the Saints, as ſhall more fully appeare in the next Section.
               61. To the third I anſwere, that to beleeue in a creature, is to deifie that creature. For as Auguſtine well obſerueth,Aug. Tractat. in Iohn 54. 
                  Wee beleeue the Apoſtle, we doe not beleeue in the Apoſtle: and we beleeue the Church, and not in the Church: and thereforeIdem ſer. de temp
                        •
                     r. 131. in the Apoſtles Creed, where we ſay, I beleeue in God; wee doe not ſay, I beleeue in the Catholicke Church, but I beleeue the Catholicke Church: whereby is plainely inſinuated, that none but God is to be beleeued in, becauſe to beleeue in a thing, is to put our truſt and confidence in that thing. As for that place in the Epiſtle to Philemon, it maketh nothing for this purpoſe; for there the word Faith is referred to the Lord Ieſus, and Loue to the Saints: neither ought Saint Hieromes authority more preiudicate vs in this interpretation, then it doth them in many ſuch like, whom they reiect as they do the reſt of the Fathers, at their pleaſures: eſpecially, ſeeing no man elſe beſides himſelfe is of that minde: at leaſt wiſe, if he vnderſtand by faith, to beleeue in the Saints, and not to beleeue them onely: the one whereof is proper to the Creator, the other to the creatures.
               62. To the laſt I anſwere, that Prayer is properly one of the ſacrifices of the New Teſtament; for here the ſacrifices are not corporall, but ſpirituall, as may bee prooued in generall by that which our Sauiour ſaith, Iohn 4. God will be worſhipped in Spirit, and truth. And in particular, by comparing Mal. 1. 11. with 1. Tim. 2. 8. for whereas Malachie prophecyingMal. 1. 11. 1. Tim. 2. 8. of the Kingdome of Chriſt, had ſaid that Incenſe, and a cleane offering ſhould be offered to God in euery place: Paul ſheweth what is meant hereby, when he commandeth to lift vp pure hands vnto God in euery place. But ſuppoſe that it were improperly called a ſacrifice, yet it looſeth not the knot; for all

kinde of ſacrifices, both proper and improper, corporall and ſpirituall, are due onely vnto God: for to whome belongeth a
                  Aug. de ciuit. li. 8 cap. vlt. 
                  Temple and Altar, to him belongeth a ſacrifice, ſaith Saint Auguſtine: but no Temple or Altar, proper or improper, is to be built, or ſet vp to any but to God: and therfore no ſacrifice is to be offered but to him.
               63. Laſtly, touching the authority of the Fathers, which are alleaged ſo frequently by Bellarmine, to prooue the Inuocation of Saints: and from which Caſſander would draw this concluſion, That it was not credible that thoſe holy men would admit any doctrine or cuſtome, which they ſuppoſed to bee contrary to the Euangelicall and Apoſtolicall doctrine, or detract any thing from the glory of God, or the merit of Chriſt, when as they vnderwent ſo heauie conflicts for Chriſts ſake. Here, (not to keepe the Reader in ſuſpenſe, referring a fuller ſatisfaction to this argument to a more fit place) foure things are to bee noted; firſt, that for the ſpace of two hundred yeares after Chriſt, the Interceſſion and Inuocation of Saints, were doctrines vnknowne vnto the Church: and therefore they alledge no Father within that compaſſe, ſaue Dioniſius Areopagita:
                  Dioniſ. Areopag. Eccleſ. Hier. c. 7. 
                  Cap. 7. Eccleſ. Hierarch: which booke, as diuers other that goe vnder that name, Illyricus hath proued to bee counterfeit by impregnable reaſons. And Iraeneus, Lib. 5.Iraeneus cont. haereſ. lib. 5. 
                  contra Haereſ. who ſaith, that the Virgine Mary was made the Aduocate of the Virgine Eue: by which hee could not meane that Eue did pray vnto Mary here on earth, ſeeing Mary wasOrig. in Epiſt. ad Rom. lib. 2. & hom. 3. in Cant.

               64. Secondly, thoſe Fathers that liued in the next two hundred yeares, ſpeake of this matter very variouſly and doubtfully, as if it were a doctrine which they knew not what to ſay to, & were not fully reſolued in. Thirdly, of thoſe Fathers which he alleageth, though in ſome places they ſeeme to allow that cuſtome which was then brought into the Church: yet in other places they diſallow the ſame. Yea, and they are

diſapprooued alſo of others that liued in the ſame age. Thus true Athanaſius condemneth Inuocation of Saints, Orat. 2. & 3. contra Arianos: and falſe Athanaſius alloweth it, Sermon. in Euangel. de Sanctiſſima Deipara. Baſil approueth it, but Nazianzene doubteth of it, and Epiphanius that liued alſo about that time, vtterly condemneth i
                     •
                  . Chryſoſtome in ſome places ſeemeth to allow of it; in others, he ſpeaketh againſt it: and ſo doth Auguſtine, and the reſt, as you may ſee at large prooued by Chemnitius in his examine of the Councill ofChemnit. exam. de Inuoc. Sanct. 
                  Trent. And that which is not to be forgotten, they alleage many falſe and counterfeit Bookes, vnder the name of the Fathers, as Dionyſius Areopagita. Eccleſiaſt. Hierar. Athanaſ. Serm. de Sanctiſſima Deipara. Chryſoſt. hom. ad pop. 66. and many others of the like impreſſion, as the ſame Chemnitius hath learnedly and vnanſwerably prooued.
               65. Laſtly, thoſe Fathers which doe defend this Inuocation, yet do not defend it as it is now practiſed in the Church of Rome: for firſt, the Fathers, if they did allow of this Inuocation, yet it was in their priuate deuotions, not in the publike Leiturgie of the Church: for it cannot bee prooued, that in any of the ancient Leiturgies this Inuocation was vſed, vntill Gregorie the firſts time (for as for that which was called Chryſoſtomes Maſſe, all know it is a baſtard brat, and not a true Child of that good Father) but in the Church of Rome it is practiſed in their publicke ſeruice, and ſo is come from a matter of priuate deuotion, to a generall practice of Religion. Secondly, the Fathers, though they may ſeeme to haue prayed ſometimes vnto the Saints, out of the heate of their deuotion; yet it was but now and then, and as it were, by the way, whereas their ordinary prayers and deuotions were directed vnto God: but in the Church of Rome the Saints are more prayed vnto, then God; he hath the leaſt, and they the greateſt ſhare in their deuotion; witneſſe the Letanie of the bleſſed Virgin Marie, and the Marie Pſalter, and their Common practice. Thirdly, the Fathers, albeit they directed their prayers ſometimes to the Saints, yet they repoſed moſt confidence in their prayers to God, and in the mediation

of Chriſt, as appeareth by that which Chryſoſtome ſaith; Ad
                  Chryſoſt. hom. 12 in Math. 
                  Deum non oſtiar
                        •
                     o, &c. We need no Porter, nor Mediator, nor Miniſter, to bring vs to God: ſay but, Miſerere mei Deus, &c. And in another place hee ſaith, that when wee pray our ſelues to
                  Idem hom. de prof. Euang. 
                  God, wee obtaine more, then when others pray for vs. But the ſuperſtitious Romaniſts thinke to ſpeede better when they pray to the Saints, then when vnto God: And therefore they are not aſhamed to ſay, that we muſt appeale from the CourtBernardine in marial. of Gods iuſtice, to the Court of his Mothers mercy. Fourthly, the Fathers did not ſo much as dreame of any merits of ſupererogation which ſhould be in the Saints, and by them ſhould be communicated vntovs: but all the intereſt and benefit which we haue to & in the merits of the Saints, in their iudgement, was, by vertue of the Communion of Saints: that as the members of one body enioy the ſtrength and vigor that is in each other; ſo the members of Chriſt militant,Aug. in Pſal. 130 receiue a certaine benefit from the gifts of God, beſtowedCaſſand. conſult. de Inuoc. Sanct. vpon the Saints triumphant, and doe as it were merite by their merits, becauſe they are all members of one and the ſame myſticall body. But the Romaniſts hold, that the Saints doe ſupererogate, that is, hauing more merits then they need themſelues, doe conferre ſome of their ſuperabundance vpon their poore brethren that want. Fiftly, the Fathers, when they ſpake of praying to the Saints, did not ſpeake poſitiuely, but tropically, and figuratiuely, by hyperbolicall, and Rhetoricall Apoſtophers, as may appeare plainely in the Orations of Nazianzen, and other of their writings: But the Romaniſts conclude poſitiuely, and doctrinally, without any Rhetoricall figures, or Hyperbolicall elocutions. Sixtly, as Caſſander confeſſeth, when the Fathers ſaid to the Saints, Orate pronobis, they meant, Vtinam oretis pro nobis, Would to God they would pray for vs; and ſo they were rather wiſhes, then prayers: But the Romaniſts admit no ſuch extenuation, but flatly affirme, that wee ought directly to pray vnto them as our Patrons, Protectors, and Interceſſors. And laſtly, the Fathers relyed not vpon the interceſſion of Saints, except there were in themſelues a care and conſcience of a godly

life: but in Popery, notorious, wicked, and vngodly perſons, that neuer thinke vpon amendment of their liues, but perſeuere in their ſinnes without repentance: yet doe aſſure themſelues to bee ſaued by the merits and interceſſion of the Saints. And thus, howſoeuer they make a ſhew of Fathers, to cloke their Idolatry withal; yet the Fathers, if they be rightly vnderſtood, are as much different from them, as blacke is from white. And the Fathers might bee free from Idolatrie, when as they remaine guiltie.
               66. The third and laſt way whereby they turne the bleſſed Saints into Idols, is by putting their truſt and confidence in their merits and mediation: which kinde of ſpirituall worſhip is due only vnto the diuine Maieſtie, as hath been ſhewed. The truth of which aſſertion may be proued, firſt, by their doctrine, & ſecondly, by the publike practice of their Church. Touching their doctrine, to omit the impious, impudent, and blaſphemous opinions of their Monkes and Friers, who haue egregiouſly exceeded the bounds of all pietie in this point, left the Romaniſts ſhould ſay, that they were but priuate mens conceits, and not the receiued doctrines of the Church; I will onely relate ſome few ſentences out of their moſt publicke and athenticke writings.
               67. And to begin with Peter Lumbard; he ſaith, that theLumbard lib. 4. diſt. 45. 
                  Saints doe intercede for vs both by their merite, and by their affection: therefore we pray vnto them, that their merits may helpe vs, and that they would will our good; becauſe, if they will it, God alſo will will it, and it ſhall be done. Thus hee makes Gods will to depend vpon theirs, and not theirs vpon Gods; and conſequently, more truſt to be repoſed in them, then in God. Alexander Alenſis, the moſt ancient of the Schoolemen,Alex. Alenſis in 4. Sentent. q. 92. me

                     b. 1. art. 4. writeth, that the Saints are to bee prayed vnto for three cauſes: Firſt, eyther for our pouerty in meriting, that where our merits faile; others may patronize vs: or for our pouertie in contemplation, that wee not being able to behold the higheſt light in it ſelfe, may behold the ſame in the Saints: or for our pouertie in louing, becauſe the efficacie of prayer ariſeth from deuotion: and for the moſt part, an imperfect man doth feele himſelfe more

                  towards the Saints, then towards God. Secondly, for the glory of the Saints, that whilſt wee obtaine that which wee deſire by their ſuffrages, wee may magnifie them. And thirdly, for the reuerence of God, that a ſinner that dares not come vnto him in his owne perſon, may fly to the Saints, and implore their helps. Bonauenture affirmeth, that the Saints by their merits haue not
                  Bonauent. in 4. ſentent. D. 45. 
                  onely deſerued happineſſe and glory to themſelues, but alſo by their merits of ſupererogation, haue power to helpe others that pray vnto them. And againe he ſaith, He that was before vnworthy, by praying to the Saints is made worthy. Aquinas giueth this reaſon for praying to the Saints; Quia vltima reducuntur
                  Aquinas ſuple
                        •

                  in Deum per media: Becauſe the extremes are reduced to God by the meanes, therfore Gods benefits are conuayed vnto vs by the meanes of the Saints. Biel ſaith, that we oughtGab. Biel. ſuper Canon. to fly to the refuge of the Saints, that we may be ſaued by their merits and prayers: and he ſaith further, that God hath giuen halfe his Kingdome to the bleſſed Virgine, the Queene of heauen; as Aſſuerus promiſed to Queene Eſter: and ſo retayning iuſtice to himſelfe, he hath graunted mercy to her to be exerciſed. And vpon this ground, is that ſaying of Bernhardine, that weBernhardine in marial. Antonin. part. 4. tit. 15. muſt appeale from the Court of Gods iuſtice, to the Court of his Mothers mercy. But Antoninus, the Archbiſhop of Florence is more playne then them all: for hee telleth vs, That it muſt needs be, that to whomſoeuer the bleſſed Virgin turneth her eyes, they muſt be iuſtified and ſaued. And againe, that Chriſt is not only an Aduocate, but a Iudge: and therefore a ſinner dareth not approch vnto him; but that God hath prouided vs of an Aduocatreſſe, which is ſweet and milde, and in whom is no bitterneſſe. And againe, Mary is that Throne of grace, ſpoken of Heb. 4. 16. to whom we muſt approch with confidence, that we
                  Heb. 4. 16. 
                  may obtayne mercy, and find grace, in the time of neede: Againe, he calleth the Virgin Mary, the gate of heauen, becauſe whatſoeuer grace euer came out of heauen into the world, came out by her meanes: and whatſoeuer thing entreth into heauen, muſt enter by her: and ſo he calleth the other Saints, Portas coeli: The gates of heauen. Becauſe by their prayers they carry vs intoSotus in confeſſ. Cathol. heauen. Sotus ſaith, that the Saints are coadiutors, and
                  
                  cohelpers in the worke of our ſaluation. Many ſuch-like blaſphemousSotus in confeſſ. Cathol. ſayings might bee alledged out of their ſubtile Schoolemen, whereby it euidently appeareth, that in thoſe dayes the poore ignorant Romaniſts were taught to repoſe the truſt and confidence of their ſaluation, in the merits and mediation of the Saints; yea, and that more then in Chriſt: as that publike Picture which was extant in many of their Churches doth more fully prooue: when as Chriſt our Sauiour was painted like a ſterne man caſting darts, and the people flying for ſuccour to the Virgine Mary, who interpoſed her ſelfe, and ſhewing her Sonne her breſts, receiued his darts in her garment. If this bee not, beſides Idolatrie, horrible and fearefull blaſphemy, let all men iudge.
               68. But what? is the doctrine of latter times any whit purer? no verily: for the Councill of Trent, that was called in pretence to this end, to reforme abuſes in the Church, and to reſtore Religion to ſome puritie, doth approoue and confirmeConcil. Trident. Seſſ. 9. all theſe groſſe opinions of the Schoole Diuines: for thus it decreeth; that it is good and profitable, humbly to inuocate the Saints, and to fly to their prayers and ſuccour for the obtayning of bleſſing from God in Chriſt. And that wee may ſee the meaning of this Decree, the Romane Catechiſme, whichCatechiſ. Roman. was made by the commaundement of the Biſhop of Rome, doth more expreſſely affirme, that the Saints are therefore to be called vpon, becauſe they pray continually for the ſaluation of men: and God beſtoweth many benefits vpon vs for their merit and grace ſake: and that they obtaine pardon for our ſinnes, and reconcile vs into the fauour of God. And for the refining Ieſuites, they haue not yet refined this errour: for, Coſter writeth,Coſter Enchir. 
                  that the Saints are to be inuocated, both that they may mediate our cauſe to God, and alſo, that themſelues may helpe vs. Ʋiega, another Ieſuite, ſaith, that they are as it were the dores,

But from their doctrine, let vs come to the practice of their Church, and we ſhall ſee this more cleerely: and heere ſome few examples ſhall ſerue for a taſte; for to propound all in this kinde, would bee both tedious and needleſſe. Thus therefore in their publike Seruice Bookes, Roſaries, and Breuiaries, they pray vnto the Saints:
               To Saint Paul.
               
               Vouchſafe to bring thy humble ſuppliants to heauen after the end of this life, to whom thou haſt reuealed the light of truth.

               Vouchſafe to eſtabliſh vs, thy ſuppliants, in his faith, by handling of whō, thou deſeruedſt to acknowledge to be God.
               To Saint Iohn.
               
               Haile, ô holy Apoſtle of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, I intreat thee by his loue who choſe thee out of the world, that thou wouldeſt deliuer me, thy vnworthy ſeruant, from all aduerſitie, and from all impediments of body and ſoule, and receiuing my ſoule at the houre of death, wouldeſt bring me to life euerlaſting.
               To Saint George thus:
               Hee ſaue vs from our ſinnes, that wee may reſt with the bleſſed in heauen.
               Here Saint George is made a Sauiour, and that from ſinne: and ſo either Chriſt is cleere put out of his office, or George ioyned with him in his office.
               
                  Againe, to Saint Eraſmus.
               
               Graunt, that by thy merits and prayers, we may ouercome all the ſnares of our enemies, and be freed from the pouerty of body and minde, and from eternall death.
               To Saint Chriſtopher.
               
               O glorious Martyr, Chriſtopher, bee mindefull of vs to God, and without delay, defend our body, ſenſe and honor, thou that deſeruedſt to carry in thine armes ouer the Sea, the Flower of heauen, cauſe vs to auoid all wickedneſſe, and to loue God with all our hearts.

wonder into what an abominable Idoll they haue tranſlated, not her (for ſhee abhorres their impietie,) but the Idea and fancy of her, which they haue deuiſed in their owne braynes: for they call her the Queene of heauen, the Mother of mercy, the Gate of Paradiſe, the Life and hope of a ſinner, the Light of the Church, the Lady of the world, the Aduocatreſſe and Mediatrix of mankinde: yea, they ſay, that the deathBernhardinmariale. and paſſion of Chriſt and the holy Virgine, was for the redemption of mankinde; and that ſhe alſo muſt come betwixt God and vs for the remiſſion of ſinne; and that her Sonne

                  and ſhe redeemed the world with one heart: as Adam and Eue ſold the world for one apple. And thus they ioyne the Virgine Mary with Chriſt in the office of our redemption, and ſo make her equall with him, which were ſomewhat tolerable, if they could ſtay there, but they climbe higher in impudency, and not onely match her with Chriſt, but ſet her aboue him: For they tell vs of a viſion, How Chriſt preparing to iudge the world, there were two Ladders ſet, that reached to heauen: the one red, at the top whereof Chriſt ſate; theSpec. exempl. d. 7. 11. 4. other white, at the top whereof the Virgine Mary ſate: and when the Friers could not get vp by the red Ladder of Chriſt, but euermore fell downe, Saint Francis called them to the white Ladder of our Lady, and there they were receiued.

               71. And this the Roſarie of the Virgine Mary doth more euidently manifeſt: for Dominicke, who was the firſt inuentor of it, ordayned that fiftie Ane Maries ſhould be recited, and at euery tenth, one Pater noſter, which together make a

Roſarie: and for this purpoſe the ſame Dominicke framed fiue and fiftie Stones or Beades, and hung them together on a ſtring, betwixt euery ten little ones, one great one, and called them Patriloquia, as it were prayers to the Father; which he might more properly haue called, Matriloquia, prayers to the Mother: for here are ten Aues, to each Pater noſter. And this was the originall of praying vpon Beads. Now out of theſe Roſaries, ſprung there Mary Pſalters: for three Roſaries, to wit, an hundred and fifty Aue Maries, and fifteene Pater noſters, make one Mary Pſalter, becauſe, forſooth, the Pſalter of Dauid conſiſts of ſo many Pſalmes: and to the fraternitie of this Pſalter, and the ſayers thereof, were giuen by diuers Popes, as Sixtus the fourth, and Innocent the eighth, threeſcore thouſand yeeres of indulgence, and plenary remiſſion both from the puniſhment and fault, one, in the time of life, and one in the houre of death. Is not heere, I pray you, the worſhip of the Virgine Mary exalted aboue the worſhip of Chriſt? who can doubt of it, ſeeing the proportion is ten to one, fifty to fiue, an hundred to ten, an hundred and fifty to fifteene? And no maruell, if it bee thus in their prayers, ſeeing it is as euill or worſe in their deeds: for whereas wee haue one Church, or religious houſe, dedicated to Chriſt, we ſhall finde ten dedicated to Mary the Mother of Chriſt: and ſo the Mother is aduanced aboue the Sonne, and yet ſhe but a woman of fleſh and bloud, ſaued by her Sonne, and bleſſed by that faith which ſhee had in him, and hee the Sonne of God, as well as the Sonne of Man, the Sauiour and Redeemer of mankinde.
               72. But the moſt horrible Idolatrie and blaſphemy of all the reſt, is to be found in another Mary Pſalter of theirs, compiled (as they ſay) by Bonauenture, and authoriſed in theCaſſand. conſult. pag. 155. Church of Rome: wherein they apply all the whole Pſalter of Dauid, to the Virgine Mary; and whereſoeuer they finde the name, Dominus, Lord, they put in, Domina, Lady: as for example, in the third Pſalme, for, Lord, how are my foes increaſt; they ſay, Lady, how are my foes increaſt! and in the ſixt Pſalme, for, O Lord, correct mee not in thy wrath; they ſay,

                  O Lady, correct me not in thy wrath. And in the 31. Pſalme, for, Bleſſed are they, O Lord, whoſe ſinnes are forgiuen; they ſay, Bleſſed are they whoſe hearts loue thee, O Virgine Mary; for their ſinnes ſhall be forgiuen them by thee: and ſo cleane through the Pſalter. If any deſire to ſee the gulfe and dunghill of Superſtition and Idolatrie, practiſed in the Church of Rome, vnder the Inuocation of Saints, let him but read this one Pſalter, which alone, if there were no other argument, is ſufficient to conuince their whole Church of open and notorious Idolatrie: and that, Caſſander himſelfe confeſſeth in the place aboue quoted.
               73. Thus they exalt the Virgine Mary aboue Chriſt, and equall her with God: yea, which is horrible to ſpeake, and fearefull to be recorded, they place her aboue God himſelfe: for they teach, that a man may appeale to the Virgine Mary, not onely from a Tyrant, and from the Diuell; but euen from God himſelfe. This writeth Bernardine de Buſto, about 120.Bernardine de Buſto. marial. p. 3. ſer. 3. pa. 96 Poſſeuine in Appar. ſacr. Pet. Mathaeus com. ſub conſtit. Pii. 2. pag. 20. yeeres ſince, and his booke was authoriſed by Pope Alexander the ſixt, and yet remaines ſo farre from all diſallowance, that it is approoued by Poſſeuine, as a learned and godly booke. Out of which it muſt needes follow (which I tremble to vtter) that by their doctrine, the Virgine Mary is greater then God; becauſe euery appeale is from the leſſer to the greater.
               74. But no maruell, if they preferre Mary to Chriſt, that is, the Mother before the Sonne, ſeeing they doe as much to two Fryers, Francis and Dominicke. He that would ſee how Francis is matched and exalted aboue Chriſt, let him read the booke of his Conformities, and hee will bee aſtoniſhed at their madneſſe. Alſo, of Dominicke they write moſt ſtrange things, and ſuch, as Chriſt neuer did the like: as for example; Chriſt rayſed but three dead (ſaith Antoninus:) but Dominicke
                  
                     Antonin. part. 3. tit. 23. c. 1. 
                        •
                     . 3. rayſed three at Rome, and forty that were drowned in a Riuer neere to Tholoſſe. Chriſt being made immortall after his reſurrection, entred twice into the houſe, the dores being ſhut: but Dominicke, being a mortall man, entred into a Church in the night, the dores being ſhut, that he might

not waken the brethren. Chriſt had all power committed vnto him in heauen and earth: and Dominicke did partake the ſame power with him; for the Angels ſerued him, the Elements obeyed him, & the Diuels trembled at him. Chriſt was the Lord abſolutely, and by authority: but Dominicke principally, and by poſſeſſion. Chriſt was laid at his birth in a Manger, and wrapped in clouts to keepe him from cold: but Dominicke being an infant, would often get out of his bed, and as if hee abhorred all delights of the fleſh, lye vpon the bare ground. Chriſt neuer prayed, but hee was heard, if he would; except in the Garden, when hee prayed that the Cup might paſſe away from him, where praying according to his ſenſuall part, would not be heard according to reaſon: but Dominicke neuer deſired any thing of God, but it was graunted vnto him. Chriſt being borne, a Starre appeared in the Eaſt, which directed the Wiſe-men to him, and foreſhewed that he ſhould be the light of the world: but Dominicke being borne, and ready to bee baptized, his Godmother ſaw a Starre in his forehead, foretelling a new light of the world. Laſtly, Chriſt loued vs, and waſhed away our ſinnes by his bloud: ſo did Dominicke; for hee whipt himſelfe thrice euery day with an Iron chayne, and drew bloud each time out of his ſides: once for his owne ſinnes, which were very ſmall; the ſecond for thoſe that were in Purgatory; and the third for thoſe that liue in the world. Is not Dominicke heere in ſome things equalled, and in others preferred before our bleſſed Sauiour, Ieſus Chriſt?
               75. And thus to paſſe ouer all their falſe and counterfeit Saints, which eyther neuer were in rerum natura, or were not ſuch as they make them: as Chriſtopher, George, Catherine,
                  Bel. de beat. Sanct. lib. 1. ca. 9. and ſuch like. For it is a true ſaying of Auguſtine, or of ſome other; Multorum corpora honorantur in terris, quorum animae torquentur in inferno: The bodies of many are honoured on earth, whoſe ſoules are tormented in hell. And to omitCaict. tract. de concept. & Indulg. Bel. de eccleſ. triump. l. 1. c. 9. that the Pope may erre in the canonizing of Saints, it being grounded vpon falſe miracles: as Caietane acknowledgeth, and others; though Bellarmine be of another minde,

and laboureth to prooue the contrary: but (God wot) with very ſhallow reaſons, as any may diſcerne that will but read him. To omit (I ſay) all this, by that which hath beene ſayd it is moſt cleere, that vnder the doctrine and practice of Inuocation of Saints in the Church of Rome, lyeth lurking moſt abominable Idolatry.
               76. The laſt principall branch of Idolatry, maintayned and practiſed in the Church of Rome, is the adoration and worſhipping of the Croſſe. Now by the Croſſe they vnderſtand, eyther the true Croſſe of Chriſt, together with any part or portion thereof; or the picture or image of that Croſſe, whether it bee materiall and permanent, or tranſeunt and formall onely. Of both which this is the doctrine of the Church of Rome: that not onely that Croſſe whereon Chriſt dyed, but euery picture and repreſentation of it, whether grauen or paynted
                     •
                  , or expreſſed in the ayre, with the hand and fingers, is to be kiſſed and adored. This is the poſition
                     Vaſques de Adora. l. 3. c. 2. Bel. de Imag. l. 3. c. 27. 28. 29. of 
                     Ʋaſques the Ieſuite; and hee ſaith, that it is the doctrine and faith of the Romane Church. And the ſame is auouched by Bellarmine, and confirmed by many arguments (weake ones, God wot) in three whole Chapters: wherein hee laboureth to prooue; firſt, that the Croſſe it ſelfe: ſecondly, that the Image of the Croſſe: and thirdly, that the ſigne of the Croſſe, are all to be worſhipped: and with what kind of worſhip? Aquinas reſolues vs in that point, whē he affirmeth,Aquin. Sum. part. 3. art. 4. that the very Croſſe of Chriſt, whereon he was crucified, is to bee worſhipped with diuine worſhip: for two cauſes; both for the repreſentation or reſemblance it hath to Chriſt; as alſo, for that it touched the body of Chriſt: but the ſigne of the Croſſe or Crucifix, is to be worſhipped with latria, onely in the former reſpect. And this is ſtill the doctrine of their Church: for neither is it taxed in their late editions for errour, nor contradicted by any other Romiſh Doctor. Yea, aChryſ. a viſitat. de verb. domini, tom. 4 l. 6. c. 7 late famous Papiſt, and a profeſſor of Diuinitie, doth plainely confirme the fame: dedicating his booke to Pope Clement the eighth, for he ſaith in playne words, that they worſhip the Croſſe with the ſame worſhip wherewith they adore Chriſt him▪
                  
                  
                  ſelfe: and that they pray vnto the Croſſe, as vnto him that was crucified on it, and repoſe the hope of their ſaluation vpon it.
               
               77. And this is the doctrine of the Romiſh Synagogue at this day; and their practice is correſpondent thereunto: for they kneele vnto the Croſſe, they kiſſe it, they creepe vnto it, they pray vnto it; yea, they repoſe the hope of their ſaluation in it: as appeareth in that forme of prayer vſed in their Maſſe booke:
               All haile, ô Croſſe, our onely hope; in this time of Lent, doe thou increaſe righteouſnes in good men, and graunt pardon to ſinners.
               Now that this is heatheniſh Idolatrie, may appeare by theſe reaſons: Firſt, becauſe outward religious adoration is giuen to a piece of wood, or braſſe, or gold, or ſome other matter.Aug. in Fauſt. lib. 15. Secondly, becauſe diuine worſhip, euen latria, which Auguſtine ſaith, is proper onely vnto God, is giuen to a creature: for ſuch is the Croſſe, at the beſt. Thirdly, becauſe they pray vnto it, as vnto a liuing thing. Fourthly, becauſe they repoſe the hope of their ſaluation in it. And laſtly, becauſe many, if not all of theſe Reliques, which are beleeued to bee fragments of Chriſts Croſſe, are falſe and counterfeit; as hath beene ſhewed already. In all theſe reſpects the Croſſe is made an Idoll, and the worſhippers of it are no better then Idolaters.
               78. Ob. I, but the Croſſe touched Chriſt, and therefore it is to bee worſhipped with diuine worſhip. R. So did the Manger wherein hee lay, being an infant; and the Graue wherein he was layd, being dead; and the Pillar whereunto he leaned, being whipped; and the Aſſe where on hee rode, being in his iourney to the City: yea, ſo did the wombe of the bleſſed Virgine his Mother, before hee was borne: and yet they will not ſay that any of theſe are to bee worſhipped with latria. I am ſure the Apoſtles cannot bee found to haue giuen any maner of religious worſhip to any of theſe things, much leſſe diuine worſhip: though I deny not, but that the true Reliques of Chriſt, and thoſe things that any waies pertayned vnto him, were reuerenced without doubt by his

friends after his departure: and ſo farre we alſo willingly condeſcend vnto them; but that any religious worſhip was giuen vnto thē they can neuer prooue. Ob. I, but the Croſſe was theBell. de Imag. lib. 2. cap. 27. 
                  inſtrument of Chriſts paſſion, and Mans redemption, and the Altar of that great Sacrifice, and the Ladder by which Christ aſcended into heauen; therefore it is to bee worſhipped. R. So was Iudas an inſtrument of Chriſts paſſion, and our redemption: as Saint Auguſtine teacheth, when he ſaith, thatAug. in Pſal. 34. 
                  Iudas was elected by Chriſt, to the end, that by him hee might fulfill our redemption; and ſo was Pilate and Caiphas: yet theſe are not therefore to be worſhipped, vnleſſe wee will reuiue the old hereſie of the Cai
                        •
                     nians and the Marrionites. And ſoAug. de baereſ. cap. 18. Iraen. li. 1. ca. 29. was the Speare that let out his heart bloud, which was the price of our redemption; and yet they themſelues doe not giue diuine worſhip vnto it for that cauſe, albeit they make an Idoll of it, as hath beene declared. Ob. I, but manyBell. de Imag. lib. 2. cap. 27. myſteries are ſignified by the Croſſe: as firſt, Chriſtian perfection, in the longitude, latitude, height, and profunditie of it: the profundity ſignifying faith; the height, hope; the latitude, charitie; and the longitude, perſeuerance. Secondly, the effect of Chriſts paſſion: the higheſt peece of wood ſignifying, that heauen was opened, and God pacified: the loweſt, that was faſtned in the ground, that bel was emptied, and the Diuell conquered: the ouerthwart peece, that the whole world was redeemed, &c. Thirdly, the vniting of Iewes and Gentiles: the two armes of the Croſſes vnder one title, repreſenting the vnion of two people vnder one head. Theſe, and diuers other myſteries are hidden vnder the Croſſe, therefore it is to be worſhipped with diuine worſhip. R. Suppoſe that all theſe myſteries were there to be cōceiued; yet to ſay, that therefore it is to be worſhipped, is a ſilly reaſon, and ſcarce befitting the learning of Bellarmine: for by the ſame argument, all their Sacraments, and many other things, ſhould be worſhipped with diuine worſhip. Ob. I, but the Croſſe was miraculouſly found out by Helena: and that not before Conſtantines time, when it might ſafely bee worſhipped; and it was reuealed to bee the true Croſſe, by euident

miracles: therefore it is to be worſhipped with diuine worſhip. R. Graunt all this to bee true, which notwithſtanding may probably be queſtioned: yet that this doth not prooue that the Croſſe is to bee worſhipped, Helenes owne example doeth ſhew: for as Ambroſe writeth, Shee worſhipped
                  Ambroſ de obitu Theodoſ. 
                  not the wood of the Croſſe, but him that hung vpon the wood, becauſe this (ſaith he) is a heatheniſh errour, &c. neither can they euer prooue that it was therefore reuealed, that it might be worſhipped.
               79. Did euer any man read more pittifull arguments? the reſt which 
                     •
                  ee vſeth are all of the ſame ſtampe. Ob. I, but a Crucifix is like vnto Chriſt, ſaith hee, therefore it i
                     •
                  to beeBell. ibid. worſhipped with latria. R. But the Virgin his Mother was more like to him, and yet they giue not vnto her ſo high a worſhip. Ob. I, but the Fathers held the Croſſe in great reuerence, and the Image of the Croſſe, and worſhipped them. R. True, they reuerenced them, and held them in great eſtimation: but yet there was no worſhip giuen vnto them, vntill neere 400. yeeres after Chriſt. About that time began this ſuperſtition: for in Saint Ambroſe time it was not crept in, as appeareth by that teſtimony before alledged: not in Arnobius time, who plainely affirmeth, that they did
                  Arnob. lib. 8. 
                  not worſhip Croſſes. Againe, thoſe Fathers that did adore them, did not worſhip the Croſſe or the Crucifix, but him that hung vpon the Croſſe; as may appeare by Hieroms teſtimonyHierom in epit. Paulae. concerning Paulae, who ſaith, that ſhee falling proſtrate before the Croſſe, worſhipped as if ſhee had ſeene the Lord there hanging before her: by which it is playne, that ſhe worſhipped not the Croſſe, but the Lord. And Ambroſe alſo witneſſethAmbroſ. de obitu Theodoſ. the ſame, when he calleth it an heatheniſh errour, and the vanitie of wickedmen to worſhip the Croſſe. But the Romaniſts teach, that the Croſſe it ſelfe, and the Crucifix are to be worſhipped, and that with the higheſt worſhip. Ob. I, but many and ſtrange miracles haue beene wrought by the ſigne of the Croſſe; therefore it is to bee worſhipped. R. The argument is naught: for if euery worker of miracles ſhould be worſhipped with diuine adoration, then all the Apoſtles

might challenge this honour vnto them. So might Iannes and Iambres that reſiſted Moſes. Yea, ſo might Antichriſt himſelfe: for his comming is with lying ſignes and wonders: lying, not onely in reſpect of their ſubſtance, which is ſometimes counterfeit: but alſo in reſpect of the end, which is to ſeduce, when the miracle for ſubſtance may bee true: and this is both Saint Chryſtoſtomes and Saint Auguſtines expoſitionChryſoſt. in 2. theſ. 2. Aug. de ciuit. lib. 20. c. 19. of that place: beſides, the myracles that were done at or before this ſigne, were effected by the power of the faith and inuocation of Chriſt crucified; and not by the bare ſigne of the Croſſe, as moſt of the Fathers confeſſe, and all ofAug. ſer. 19. de▪

And therefore the ſigning of themſelues with the Croſſe, was a ſecret kinde of inuocation of Chriſt crucified; as Bellarmine himſelfe acknowledgeth. And thus it followeth, that thoſe myracles which they talke of: as the driuing away of Diuels, and ouercomming mortall enemies, and ſuch like, are not to be aſcribed to the ſigne of the Croſſe, but to inuocation, and prayer, and faith in Chriſt crucified.
               80. Ob. I, but the Apoſtle Paul ſaith, God forbid that I
                  Gal, 6. 14. 
                  ſhould reioyce in any thing, but inthe Croſſe of our Lord Ieſus
                  Gal. 2. 14. 
                  Christ: and, He tooke the handwriting that was againſt vs, and
                  Gal. 2. 20. 
                  nayled it on his Croſſe: and, he ſet all things at peace through the bloud of his Croſſe, &c. therefore it is to be worſhipped. R. The conſequent of this arguments as good as the former; for how can it follow, that becauſe the Croſſe was the inſtrument of our redemption, therefore it ſhould be adored? The weaknes of this ſequell is before diſcouered. Beſides, by the Croſſe is vnderſtood moſt commonly in the Scripture, eyther the whole worke of Chriſts paſſion, or afflictions and perſecutions for Chriſts ſake; neyther of which, eſpecially the latter, are to be adored with diuine adoration. In a word, there is nothing they can alledge, that doth carry with it any ſhew of ſound reaſon, to hide the ſhame of their Church in this open Idolatrie, and yet they labour tooth and nayle for it; but they profite but a little.
               81. Wee confeſſe that there was a holy and commendable

vſe of the tranſcant ſigne of the Croſſe in the primitiue Church: to wit, as a badge of Chriſtian profeſſion, to ſignifie that they were not aſhamed of their crucified God, which the heathen and wicked Iewes vſed to caſt in their teeth: and ſo of the permanent Croſſe erected in publike places, to be as it were a trophee and monument of the exaltation of him that dyed on the Croſſe. But now Popery hath turned this laudable vſe of the Croſſe into Paganiſh abomination; and hath giuen to it that honour which belonged to him that dyed vpon the Croſſe: and therefore wee moſt iuſtly accuſe them of fou
                     •
                  e Idolatrie, and finde them guilty without all controuerſie, and that not onely in th
                     •
                  s laſt enditement, touching the Croſſe, but alſo in the foure former heads. And therefore the concluſion is by neceſſary conſequence moſt firme and true, that ſeeing the Church of Rome is thus many wayes guiltie of Idolatry, therefore it is to bee abandoned and forſaken, and that religion which maintayneth this impiety, worthily to be abhorred.
            
            
               
                  MOTIVE. VIII. That Religion which implyeth manifold contradiction in it ſelfe, and is contrary to it ſelfe in many things, cannot be the true Religion: but ſuch is the Religion of the Church of Rome: ergo, &c.
               1. IT is an old ſaying and true, Oportet mendacem eſſe memorem: It behooueth a lyar to haue a good memory, leſt he croſſe himſelfe in his tale, and ſo diſcouer his falſhood. This ſaying is verified in our Aduerſaries the Romaniſts, whoſe Religion, being nothing elſe but a bundle of lyes, and a hotch-potch of olde hereſies, croſſeth it ſelfe in many ſubſtantiall poynts, and thereby reuealeth the manifold errours and falſities that lurke in the boſome thereof. That this is true, the diſcourſe enſuing thereof (I hope) ſhall make ſo manifeſt, that they themſelues ſhall not be able to gainfay it.
               
                  2. The Maior propoſition in this argument is of ſuch euidentMAIOR. verity, that by no ſhew of reaſon it can poſſibly be contradicted; conſidering that truth is alwayes, and in euery part, like to it ſelfe, and agreeing, conſenting, and conſpiring with it ſelfe, as a perfect body, wherein there is ſuch a ſweet harmony of all the members. that one is not contrary to another, but all tend to one and the ſame end, and vnite their forces together, for the good of the whole: for which cauſe the Orator defineth truth to bee that which is ſimple and
                  Cic. offic. lib. 1. Terent. Bernard. in ſer. 
                  ſyncere. And the Poet ſaith, that it ſeeketh no corners. To which Saint Bernard alluding, thus writeth, Non amat veritas angulos, non ei diuerſoria placent, in medio ſtat, &c. i. It loueth no corners, by-wayes doe not pleaſe it, it ſtandeth in the miaſt. And therefore the Ancients in their Hierogliphicks repreſented truth by the picture of the Sunne, not onely inPierius valer. Hieroglyph. l. 44. pag. 430. reſpect of the puritie and clarity of it; but alſo in reſpect of the ſimplicitie and vnitie. Duplicia enim & multiplicia ſunt veritati contraria; (i) Duplicity and multiplicity, are contrary to verity. But falſity, errour, and lying, is full of doubtings, windings, and contrarieties, like a dreame in the night, the end whereof, for the moſt part is neuer agreeable to the beginning. And this is that which the Philoſopher teacheth,Ariſtotle. when he ſaith, that Mendacium de ſeipſo duplex eſt; A lye is double of it ſelfe. And as Chryſoſtome noteth, Mendacia ſi
                  Cpryſoſt. ſuper Mato. 21. 
                  non habent quem deciptant, ipſa ſibi mentiuntur; Lyes, if they haue not one to deceiue, they deceiue and beguile themſelues. So that it muſt needes follow, that that Religion which infoldeth in it ſelfe contradictions, and contrarieties, cannot be the truth, but muſt of neceſſitie be lying and erronious.
               3. I therefore leaue the Maior thus cleared, and come toMINOR. the proofe of the Minor, or ſecond propoſition, which is, that the Religion of the Church of Rome is repleniſhed with many contradictions, and is at variance and diſcord in it ſelfe, and therefore cannot ſtand: as our Sauiour concludeth of anMat. 12. houſe or a kingdom. And to ſhew this to be true, let vs firſt begin

with the Sacrament: in the doctrine whereof are enwrapped many abſurd contradictions; as for example.
               4. It is a ground and principle of their Religion, and of1. Contrad. ours, and of the truth, that Chriſt our Sauiour tooke verily and truely, fleſh of the Virgine Mary, and had a true humane body, like to vs in all things, ſinne onely excepted: and therefore that this body of his had all the demenſions and circumſcriptions of a body, and all the properties and qualities naturally belonging thereunto. This ground of truth the Church of God hath euer defended againſt all Heretikes of former and latter times, that impugned the ſame: to wit, the Marionites, the Manichees, and the Eutychians, with diuers others, that thought, and taught erroniouſly concerning the humanity of Chriſt: affirming that he had no true, but a fantaſticall body. Now this error is in outward appearance condemned by the Church of Rome, and adiudged as a damnable hereſie. But if we looke into other of their doctrines, and neceſſary conſequences that may be deriued therefrom, we ſhall fi
                     •
                  de, that they croſſe their owne poſitions, and hold in ſubſtance as much as the olde Heretikes did.
               5. For in their doctrine of the Sacrament they teach, that Chriſt gaue his owne naturall body with his owne hands toBell. de Euchar. lib. 3. cap. 19. Coſter Enchirid. his Apoſtles, when he ſaid, This is my body: by which it muſt needs follow, that he both kept his body to himſelfe, ſitting at the Table, and alſo gaue it to his Apoſtles: ſo that at this firſt Supper there were thirteene bodies of Chriſt; for euery one (by their doctrine) had the true naturall body of Chriſt wholly communicated vnto him. Now how is Chriſts bodie heere a true naturall body, being in thirteene places at once? From hence thus I reaſon: A true naturall body is circumſcribed, and can be but in one place at once: but by the Popiſh doctrine of tranſſubſtantiation, Chriſts body was in diuers places at once; therefore it was no true naturall body. And ſo the doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation dōth contradict and ouerthrow the doctrine of the truth of Chriſts

humane nature: and that, not onely after it was glorifyed, whereof, peraduenture, there might be ſome better ſhew of reaſon, but euen whilſt it was here vpon the earth, ſubiect to all humane ſinleſſe infirmities, yea, to death it ſelfe. And this concluſion is not ours, but S. Auguſtines: that is, Take away

                  from bodies (ſaith he) ſpace of place, and they will bee no where, and becauſe they will be no where, therefore they will not be at all. And againe, in the ſame Epiſtle he ſaith, ſpeaking of Chriſt, that 
                     •
                   
                  We muſt take heed that we do not ſo build vp the Diuinitie of Chriſt a man, that we take away the truth of his body. But the Romaniſts deſtroy the truth of Chriſts humanitie, by giuing vnto it an eſſentiall being and ſubſiſting in many diſtant places at once; and make it no body in truth, by denying vnto it a certayne circumſcription of one ſingular place at one time, which

                  ſlarie to all quantitiue bodies.
               6. Bellarmine, to ſalue this contradiction, labours mainely,Bell. de Euchar. lib. 3. c. 4. 5. ſtretching all the ſtrings of his wit to the higheſt ſtraine, euen till they cracke againe: but all his labour is not worth a ruſh: euery childe may ſay that he doth but tryfle; for firſt, hee ſaith that Chriſts body is but in one place locally, but in many places ſacramental
                        •
                     y. Secondly, that it is in the conſecrated hoaſt, definitiuè, and not circumſcriptiuè; definitely, and not circumſcriptiuely. Thirdly, (not ſatisfying himſelfe with this euaſion neither) he ſaith, that it is in the Sacrament, Tanquam Deus eſt in loco, As God is in a place: that is, by a ſupernaturall preſence onely. Laſtly, he flyeth to Gods omnipotency, and diſclayming all naturall reſpect, ſaith, it is a miracle: ſo that (in truth) he knoweth not what to ſay, one part of his ſpeech thwarting and croſſing another.
               7. For if the body of Chriſt bee in the Sacrament, ſacramentally onely, then it is not, either definitely, as Angels and Spirits are ſaid to be, or diuinely, as God is: for, ſacramentally to be in a place, is to bee there by way of relation, and not by corporall exiſtence, as all know; and ſo we ſay, that Chriſts body is there preſent. Againe, if it be definitiuely, then it cannot be a ſubſtantiall body, ſubſiſting of parts, and members, and quantitie, as they ſay Chriſts body doth in the

Sacrament: becauſe it is proper to Spirits, and intellectuall eſſences, to bee in a place after that manner, and not to bodyes;Aquin. p. 1. q. 52. art. 2. as their learned Aquinas telleth vs: and if it bee there after the manner of Gods preſence, then it cannot bee there after the manner of a body; vnleſſe with the Anthropomorphites, he will impiouſly aſcribe a body vnto God. And laſtly, touching Gods omnipotency, and the miracle ariſing therefrom, Bellarmine himſelfe acknowledgeth, that God cannotBell. de Euchar. lib. 3. cap. 2. doe that which doth imply contradiction; for that is to bee vnlike to himſelfe, and to deny himſelfe: but theſe things are contradictories, a body with quantity, that is, with iuſt length, bredth, proportion, ſitting at the Table, and at the ſame time, the ſame body without length, bredth, or proportion, hidden in the bread; a body viſible, and yet the ſame inuiſible at the ſame inſtant: a body with poſition and ſituation of parts, and yet the ſame without poſition and ſituation of parts, included in euery cr
                     •
                  mme of the hoaſt. Yea, laſtly, one body ſitting at the Table with his Apoſtles, ſpeaking, breathing, ſpreading his hands, and full of infirmitie: the other in the ſtomacks of his Diſciples, neither ſpeaking, nor breathing, nor ſtirring, no
                     •
                   ſubiect to infirmitie. Now compare the termes together: Sitting, and not ſitting: viſible, and inuiſible: with ſituation, and without ſituation: one, and not one, and all at the ſame inſtant and moment of time, are groſſe contradictions, which, as Bellarmine confeſſeth, Almighty God himſelfe cannot reconcile, who by his omnipotent power is able to doe all things: but this is nothing, and therefore is rather to be accounted a defect of impotency then an effect of omnipotency: Dicitur enim Deus
                  Aug. de ciuit. lib. 5. cap. 10. 
                  omnipotens faciendo quod vult, non patiendo quod non vult. i. For God is ſayd to be omnipotent, by doing that which he will, not by ſuffering that which he will not.
               
               8. From hence it muſt needes follow, that heere can bee no miracle; and that not onely becauſe miracles are extraordinary works of God; and this change of ſubſtances is ordinary in euery Sacrament, as they ſay: and miracles are not contrary, but aboue or beſide nature; but this is flat contrary,

not onely to nature, but to God himſelfe, the Authour and Creator of nature: and miracles are alwaies ſenſible, but this is inſenſible, and cannot bee diſcerned by any outward meanes: but alſo for that no miracle can imply contradiction in it ſelfe, as this muſt needes doe, if it were as they would haue it. For when Aarons Rodde was turned into a Serpent, it left to be a Rodde; and when it turned into a Rodde, it left to be a Serpent. And when the Water was turned into Wine, it left to bee Water, it was impoſſible that it ſhould haue beene both Water and Wine at one time, in one and the ſame reſpect; or a Rodde and a Serpent at once. And ſo of all other miracles, there is not one to be found that enwrappethAug. detrinit. cap. 10. contradictions. Beſides all which, Saint Auguſtine concludeth peremptorily, that Sacraments may haue honour, vt Religioſa: but not amazement vt admiranda, as miracles. And Thomas Aquinas more plainely ſaith, Ea quae contradictionem
                  Aquin. p. 1. q. 25. art. 3. 
                  implioant, ſub diuina potentia non continentur. i. Thoſe things which imply contradiction, cannot fall vnder the power of God.
               9. They reply, that they teach no more then Cyprian did, thirteeene hundred yeeres ſince, who ſaid that Chriſt did
                  Cyprian. ſer. de coena dom. 
                  beare himſelfe in his owne hands at the laſt Supper. I anſwere, that Cyprian in that place, & the reſt of the Fathers elſewhere, did often vſe hyperbolicall ſpeeches, to extoll the dignity of the Sacrament, and to ſhew the certainty and efficacy of our communion with Chriſt, and of our ſpirituall eating of him: but they neuer meant ſo as the Romaniſts doe; that Chriſt bore his reall, naturall, ſubſtantiall body in his owne hands, and gaue it to his Apoſtles after a fleſhly manner. For Cyprian
                  Cyprian. epiſt. 202. ad Euodiū. expoundeth himſelfe in another place, when hee ſaith, that Sacraments haue the names of thoſe things which they ſignifie. And Saint Auguſtine more plainly ſaith, that Chriſt did beare himſelfe in his owne hands after a ſort. If it had beene really, and ſubſtantially, what neede hee haue added, after a ſort? for this word, as they vſe to ſpeake in Schooles, is, Terminus diminutiuus, qui realitati vbique detrahit. A diminitiue terme, which detracteth from the realtie and true being of a thing. And

this ſpeech, Chriſt bore himſelfe in his owne hands after a ſort, is all one with that in another place, After a certaine manner the Sacrament of Chriſts body, is Chriſts body. So that it is playne, that when the Fathers ſaid, Chriſt bore himſelfe in his owne hands, they meant nothing, but that he bore in his hands the Sacrament of himſelfe: and thus this firſt contradiction is irreconciliable. I come to a ſecond, and that in the Sacrament, which is no leſſe palpable.
               10. It is a principle of their Religion, and of the truth2. Contrad. it ſelfe, that Chriſt after his reſurrection aſcended into heauen, and there filleth a place, and hath figure, forme, and diſpoſition of parts, and is circumſcribed within a certaine compaſſe, according to the nature of a body. This is Bellarmines
                  Bell. de Euchar. lib. 3. cap. 7. owne aſſertion, and it is conſonant to ſound doctrine, confirmed both by manifeſt Scripture, and vniforme conſent of ancient Fathers: for Scripture, Chriſt is ſaid to bee like vnto vs; and not barely like, but like in all things, that is, both in nature, and in the qualities and quantities of nature. And to put the matter out of doubt, onely one thing is exceptedPhil. 2. 7. Heb. 2. 17. Heb. 4. 25. wherin he is not like vnto vs, and that is Sinne, whereby he is abſolutely left to bee like vnto vs in all other things. And leſt any ſhould thinke, that that was true onely whilſt he was here vpon earth, the Apoſtle in the forenamed places applyeth it to him being in heauen: for hee ſaith, Wee haue not an High-prieſt which cannot be touched with our infirmities, and therefore let vs boldly goe vnto the throne of grace: where the Apoſtles argument were of no force, if he were like vnto vs here on earth, onely in the ſtate of his humilitie, and not alſo now, being in heauen, in the ſtate of glory: for ſinfull man might thus reply, True, Chriſt was like our nature whilſt he liued amongſt vs; but now, being glorified, he hath put off our nature, and therefore we dare not preſume to come vnto him. Yes, ſaith the Apoſtle, he is ſtill like vnto vs, and hath not put off our nature, but the infirmities of our nature onely, which were the ſequels of ſinne, as we alſo ſhall doe when we ſhall be tranſlated into heauen after the reſurrection. And this Saint Luke more plainely auoucheth, when he

ſaith, that after he had bleſſed them, he departed from them, and
                  Luk. 24. 5. 
                  was carryed vp into heauen: and that whilſt they beheld, he was taken vp by a cloude out of their ſight. Where we ſee plainelyAct. 1. 9. a locall motion of Chriſt from earth to heauen: and therefore there muſt needs be of him a locall ſituation in the heauens. As alſo Saint Peter in expreſſe words doeth affirme, when he ſaith, that the heauens muſt containe or receiue him,
                  Act. 3. 21. 
                  vntill the time of reſtauration of all things. Thus this doctrine is conſonant to holy Scripture.
               11. Now let vs ſee how it was entertayned by the ancient Fathers: thus they write. Athanaſius: When Chriſt ſaid, I
                  Athanaſ. in diſput. contra Arrian. 
                  goe to the Father, he ſpake of the humane nature which hee haed aſſumed: for it is the propertie of him to goe and come, who is circumſcribed with certaine limits of places; and forſaking that place where it was, commeth to the place where it was not. Nazianzene
                  Nazianz. ad Cledonium. ſaith, Wee profeſſe one and the ſame Lord, paſſible in the fleſh, impoſſible in his Godhead; circumſcribed in body, vncircumſcribed in deity; the ſame both earthly and heauenly, viſible, and inuiſible; comprehended in place, and not comprehended.
                  Ibid. Againe, Chriſt as man is circumſcribed, and contayned in place; Chriſt as God is vncircumſcribed, and contayned within no place. Auguſtine ſaith, Chriſt, as man, according to his body,
                  Auguſt. in Ioh. tract. 21. Cyril in Ioh. lib. 6. c. 14. Fulgent. ad Thraſimind. Vigil. contra Eutych. lib. 4. 
                  is in a place; but as God, filleth all places. Cyril ſaith, Though Chriſt hath taken from hence the preſence of his body: yet in the maieſtie of his deitie, hee is alwayes preſent. Fulgentius ſaith, One and the ſame Chriſt, a locall Man of a Woman his mother, who is the infinite God of God his Father. Ʋigilius the Martyr, Chriſt is in all places, according to the nature of his deitie: but is contayned in one place, according to the nature of his humanity. Damaſcene, The difference of natures in Chriſt is not taken away
                  Damaſc. apud. Euagrium lib. 2. hiſtor. c. 4. Leo. in ſolemn. natiuit. ſer. 1. 
                  by their vnion in one perſon: but the proprietie of each nature is kept ſafe. Leo, one of their Popes, Chriſt hath vnited both natures together by ſuch a league, that neither glorification doth conſume the inferiour nature, nor aſſumption doth diminiſh the ſuperiour. To theſe I might adde many more, but theſe are ſufficient to prooue, that this doctrine, touching the truth of Chriſts humanitie, now glorified in the heauens; that he hath

retained our nature with all the proprieties, ſinne onely and infirmities excepted, is concordant both with holy Scripture, and with the voited opinions of all reuerend antiquitie.
               12. Now this doctrine is croſſed and contradicted by that other doctrine of theirs, touching Tranſubſtantiation, and the carnall and corporall preſence of Chriſt in the Sacrament, for this they teach, that the body of Chriſt is in the SacramentBell. de Euchar. lib. 3. c. 5. with the whole magnitude thereof, together with a true order and diſpoſition of parts, fleſh, bloud, and bone, as he was borne, liued, crucified, roſe againe: and yet they ſay that the ſame body in the Euchariſt, though it hath magnitude and extention, and diſpoſition of parts agreeable to the forme of an humane body, neuertheleſſe doth not fill a place, neither is to bee extended nor proportioned to the placeBell. Ibid. which it poſſeſſeth: here be pregnant and manifeſt contradictions, Chriſt hath one body, and yet many bodies: euen as many as there are conſecrated hoaſts in the world, that is, it may be a thouſand bodies at once; and ſo his body is one, and not one at the ſame time. Againe, this body is in heauen in a place, and the ſame body at the ſame inſtant is on the Altar, without being compaſſed about with place: to be in heauen, and to be in earth at one inſtant, are contradictory propoſitions, being vnderſtoode of finite ſubſtances, and not of that infinite eſſence which filleth all places: for they imply thus much, to be in heauen, and net to be in heauen; to be in earth, and not to be in earth, which be the rules of Logicke, and Reaſon the mother of Logicke, cannot be together true. Againe, at one moment of time to be aboue, and yet below, to bee remooued farre off, and yet bee neere adioyning, to come to one place, and yet not to depart from another, are ſo meerely oppoſite to each other, that they cannot be reconciled. And laſtly, a body to haue forme, magnitude, extention, and diſpoſition of parts, and yet not with theſe to fill a place, is as much as to ſay, it is a body, and yet not a bodie, it is in a place, and yet not in that very ſame place: theſe are contradictions ſo euident, that it is impoſſible for the wit of man to reconcile them.
               
                  13. Notwithſtanding the aduocates of the Romiſh Synagogue labour might and maine in this taske, and by manyBell. de Euchar. lib. 3. cap. 3. arguments endeauour to reunite theſe oppoſitions: firſt, by Gods omnipotency: ſecondly, by the qualities of a glorified body: and thirdly, by arguments from the diſcourſe of reaſon. From hence they thus argue, All things are poſſible to God, and therefore this is poſſible; neither is there any thing excepted from the omnipotency of God, ſaue theſe things, Quae facere non eſt facere, ſed deficere (as Bellarmine ſpeaketh) that is, which to doe, is not to doe, but to vndoe, and doe argue rather impotency then potency, of which ſort (that one body ſhould be in many places at once, is not, ſaith he) becauſe it is not in expreſſe words excepted in Scripture, as to lye and to denye himſelfe are. To this I anſwere, firſt, that albeit the Scripture doth not expreſly except this from Gods omnipotency, to make one body to bee in two places at once, yet implyedly it doth, for it denyeth power or rather weakneſſe to God to doe thoſe things which imply contradiction:2. Cor. 1. 19. of which kinde this is, for one body to be in many places at once. And Bellarmine himſelfe ſaith, that this is aBell. de Euchar. lib. 3. cap. 2. 
                  firſt principle in the light of nature, euery thing is, or is not, which being taken away, all knowledge faileth. Secondly, I anſwere, that the power of God is not ſo much to be conſidered as his will, nor what he can doe, but what he hath reucaled in his word, that hee will doe; for if wee argue from his power toTertul. aduerſ. Prax. cap. 10. the effect, Wee may deuiſe God (ſaith Tertullian) to doe any thing, becauſe he could doe it. And therefore the ſame Authour ſaith, Dei poſſe, velle eſt, Dei nonpoſſe, nolle. God can of ſtones raiſe vp Children vnto Abraham (ſaith Iohn Baptiſt.)Mat. 3. 9. Now if any ſhould hence conclude, that any of Abrahams children were made of ſtones, in a proper ſpeech, all would thinke him to haue no more wit then a ſtone. And to this accordeth Theodoret, when hee ſaith, That God can doe all
                  Theod. Dial. 3. 
                  things which hee will, but God will not doe any of theſe things which are not agreeable to his nature. But for to make a body to be without quantity, and a quantity to be without dimenſion, and dimenſion without a place, that is as much to ſay, a

body without a body, and quantity without quantity, and a place without a place, is contrary to Gods nature; and therefore cannot bee agreeable to his will, and ſo hath no correſpondence with his power. And laſtly, I anſwere, that it is no good reaſon to ſay, God can doe ſuch a thing, therefore he doth it; but rather thus, God will doe ſuch a thing, therefore he can doe it: and thus the Scripture teacheth vs to reaſon: Whatſoeuer pleaſed the Lord, that did hee in heauen and in
                  
                     Pſal. 135. 6. 
                  earth, and not whatſoeuer hee could doe, but whatſouer it pleaſed him to do; and the Leper ſaid to our Sauiour Chriſt, Maſter, if thou wilt, thou canſt make me cleane: no
                     •
                  , if thou canſt, thou wilt; but if thou wilt, thou canſt.
               14. Secondly, whereas they obiect that Chriſts bodie after his glorification, is indued with more excellent qualities then any other naturall body, by reaſon of that ſuper-excellent glory wherewith it is adorned aboue all others, and thereby as he came to his Apoſtles, the dores being ſhut, and roſe out of his graue, notwithſtanding the ſtone that lay vpō it; and appeared vnto Paul on earth, being at the ſame time in heauen: ſo he is in the Euchariſt after a ſtrange and miraculous manner, and yet is in heauen at the ſame time. I anſwereTheodoret. Dial. 2. p. 268. firſt with Theodoret, that Chriſts bodie is not changed by his glorification into another nature, but remaineth a true bodie, filled with diuine glory: And with Auguſtine, that Chriſt gaue
                  Aug. ad Dardan. Epiſt. 57. 
                  vnto his fleſh immortality, but tooke not away nature: and in another place, That though Chriſt had a ſpirituall body after
                  Idem ad Conſen. Epiſt. 146. 
                  his reſurrection, yet it was a true bodie, becauſe he ſaid to his Diſciples, Palpate & videte, feele and ſee; and as his body was then after his reſurrection, ſo it is now being in the heauens. Secondly, that when hee came out of the graue, the Angell remoued the ſtone, with Hierome, and Iuſtine Martyr:

to pin vp our Lord in the Heauens, that he cannot be where he pleaſeth. And this is Thomas Aquinas opinion in expreſſeAquin. Sum. q. 57. art. 6. ad 3. words, which Bellarmine as expreſly contradicteth.
               15. Thirdly, by diſcourſe of reaſon hee thus laboureth to reconcile theſe contradictions, and thus diſputeth: God beingBell. de Euchar. lib. 3. c. 3. but one ſimple and inuiſible eſſence, is in infinite places at once, and he might create another world, and fill it with his preſence, and be in two worlds at one inſtant: and the ſoule of man is wholy in euery part of the body, and God is able to conſerue the ſoule in a part that is cut off from the body: therefore it implieth no contradiction to be in two places at once: againe, one place may containe two bodies, and yet be not two places, but one; as when Chriſt roſe out of the graue, the Sepulchre being ſhut; therefore one body may be in two places at once, and yet not two bodies, but one. Laſtly, there be many other myſteries of religion as ſtrange and difficult to be conceiued as this, and yet are beleeued, therefore this alſo is to be beleeued as well as they.
               16. A miſerable cauſe ſure that needeth ſuch defences: the weakeneſſe of theſe reaſons argueth the feebleneſſe of the cauſe: for, who knoweth not, but that there is no ſimilitude betweene the infinite God and a finite Creature, nor any proportion betwixt a Spirit and a body: and that à poſſe, ad eſſe, from may bee, to muſt bee, is no good conſequence? Adde that one place cannot hold two bodies, nor euer did, except they were ſo vnited, that in reſpect of place they made but one: And laſtly, that all thoſe myſteries of Religion which he nameth, to wit, the Trinity, the Incarnation, the Reſurrection, the Creation, and Annihilation, &c. haue their foundation in holy Scripture, and therefore are to be receiued as doct ines of truth, though tranſcending the ſpheare of nature and reaſon: but this ſtrange myſterie of Tranſubſtantiation hath no ground in Scripture, as he himſelfe confeſſeth:Bell. de Euchar. lib. 3. cap. 23. and therefore it is not to be beleeued as the other are, without better reaſons then he bringeth for the defence thereof: but like lips, like lettuces; ſuch as the cauſe is, ſuch are the defences, both nought and weake, as any man may ſee that is not

muffled with errour; and thus this ſecond contradiction remaines irreconciliable.
               17. A third contradiction is alſo in and about the Sacrament,3. Contrad. which is this, they teach that the matter in Sacrament is partly the outward Elements, and partly the thing ſignified and repreſented by them; and that betwixt theſe there is a certaine relation and ſimilitude, as in Baptiſme the outward ſigne which is water, and the thing ſignified, which is the bloud of Chriſt, make the matter of that Sacrament, or the outward waſting, by water, and the inward, by the Spirit, and the relation is; as the water waſheth and purgeth away all filthineſſe of the body, ſo Chriſts bloud purgeth away both the guilt and filth of ſinne from the ſoule: and ſo in the Euchariſt, the Elements of Bread and Wine, together with the bodie and bloud of Chriſt, are the matter of the Sacrament, and
                     Bell. de ſacram. lib. 1. cap. 18. the relation is, as thoſe elements doe feed, nouriſh, and ſtrengthen, and cheare the bodie of man; ſo the body and bloud of Chriſt doe ſeed, nouriſh, and ſtrengthen, and cheare the ſoule vnto eternall life: and as thoſe elements muſt be eaten and digeſted, or elſe they nouriſh not: ſo Chriſt muſt alſo be eaten, and, as it were, digeſted, and after a ſort conuerted into our ſubſtance, or elſe he is no food vnto our ſoules. This is the very doctrine of the Church of Rome, and it is agreeable to the truth, for Bellarmine thus ſpeaketh, Species illae ſignificant
                  Bell. de Euchar. lib▪ 4. cap. 6. 
                  quidem cibum ſpiritualem, ſed non ſunt ipſae cibus ſpiritualis, that is, The ſignes in the Scrament ſignifie our ſpirituall foode, but they are not the ſpirituall foode it ſelfe. And in another place he ſaith, that ſignum in Sacramento reiſignatae ſimilitudinem
                  Idem de Sacra. lib. 1. cap. 11. 
                  gerit, The ſignes in the Sacrament doe beare the ſimilitude of the thing ſignified. And in the ſame Chapter hee ſayth more plainely, that God would neuer haue ordained one thing to ſignifie another, vnleſſe it had a certaine analogie or ſimilitude with it. And herein he accordeth with the Maſter of ſentences,
                     Lumb. li. 4▪ 
                     diſt. 1 who defines a Sacrament thus, To be a viſible forme of an inuiſible grace, bearing the Image of that grace. And with Hugo,
                  
                     Hugo lib. 1. part. 9. cap 2. who ſaith, That a Sacrament is a corporall or materiall element, propounded outwardly to the ſenſes, by ſimilitude repreſenting,
                  
                  and by inſtitution ſignifying, and by Sanctification containing ſome inuiſible and ſpirituall grace. And that this relation is in eating and nouriſhing, Bellarmine in another place confeſſeth in direct words, when he ſaith, that That ſame outward
                  Bell. de Euchar. lib. 4. cap. 6. 
                  eating in the Sacrament, doth ſignifie the inward eating and refreſhing of the ſoule, but is not the cauſe thereof: and that that is ſo neceſſarie a condition, that without it we ſhould not be partakers of that diuine nouriſhment. And to this agreeth Saint Auguſtine, who plainely affirmeth, that if Sacraments
                  
                     Aug. Epiſt. 23. ad Bonifac.
                   
                  had not a certaine ſimilitude of thoſe things whereof they are Sacraments, they were not Sacraments at all. And what this ſimilitude is he declareth in another place, where hee ſaith, that We receaue viſible meate in the Sacrament; but the Sacrament
                  Idem in Iohan. tract. 26. 
                  is one thing, and the vertue of the Sacrament is another. And Thomas Aquinas giueth this as a reaſon why Bread and Wine are the fitteſt matter of this Sacrament, becauſe men moſt commonly
                  Aqui. pa. 3. q. 74. 
                  are nouriſhed therewith: his words are theſe, As water is aſſumed in the Sacrament of Baptiſme, to the vſe of ſpirituall waſhing, becauſe corporall waſhing is commonly made by water: ſo bread and wine wherewith moſt commonly men are nouriſhed, are taken vp in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, to the vſe of the ſpirituall eating. By which it followeth, that if water did not waſh, it was no fit element for the Sacrament of Baptiſme: ſo, if bread and wine doe not nouriſh, they are no fit ſignes for the Lords Supper: and for this cauſe our Sauiour at the inſtitution of this Sacrament, gaue this commandement to his Diſciples, that they ſhould take and eate: and the Apoſtle1. Cor. 10. 21. 1. Cor. 11. 20. calleth it the Lords Supper, and the Lords Table.
               
               18. This therefore is their own doctrine, and it is grounded vpon the truth. But liſten a little how they contradict this by their miraculous monſter Tranſubſtantiation: for when they ſay that the ſubſtance of the bread and wine is vtterly changed into the body and bloud of Chriſt, and that onely the accidents remaine: I would faine know of them how theſe outward ſignes doe nouriſh the bodie: can the accidents of bread and wine nouriſh the ſubſtance of the bodie? muſtSimile nutritur ſimili. there not be a ſimilitude and proportion betwixt the nouriſhment

and the thing nouriſhed? but betwixt accidents and a ſubſtance there is no ſimilitude nor proportion. Ariſtotle tellethAriſtot. de

                     nima. 2. vs as much, when he ſaith, that Foode doth nouriſh, as it is a ſubſtance, and not as an accident. Now if the outward ſignes doe not nouriſh the body, what analogie is there betwixt them and the things ſignified? or why were they ordayned to repreſent the ſpirituall refection of our ſoules by Chriſt, if they miniſter no corporall refection vnto our bodies? or how can they repreſent that where of they beare no ſimilitude? for, as in Baptiſme, if the nature and ſubſtance of the water were taken away, and onely accidents did remayne, ſo that it could not waſh, nor clenſe the body, without doubt, it could be no fit ſigne to ſignifie the inward ablution of the ſoule, by the bloud of Chriſt. So they that take away the nature and ſubſtance of the Bread and Wine, and leau

                   bare accidents, make it, without all queſtion, a dead and liueleſſe Sacrament, not fit to repreſent ſo high a myſtery.
               19 Behold now the contradictions: firſt accidents without a ſubſtance, that is to ſay, accidents, and no accidents; for therefore they are called accidents, becauſe they adhere, and are ioyned to a ſubſtance, in which they haue their ſubſiſtance, & vpon which they haue their dependance: ſo that, take away their ſubſtance, and they preſently

                  Accidentis eſſe eſt in eſſe: The eſſence of an accident is to bee in a ſubiect. Secondly, two parts of the Sacraments, the viſible elements, and the inuiſible grace, & yet but one part of the ſame Sacrament: for the elements bee taken away, and accidents onely remayne; therefore two parts, and not two parts. Thirdly, the externall matter of the Sacrament is the outward elements: and yet there are no elements at all; and ſo elements, and no elements, matter, and no matter. Fourthly, the outward elements are ſignes of the inward grace, and the ſame by their doctrine being but accidents, are ſignes of the outward elements, which are ſignes of the inward grace: and ſo they are ſignes of the ſignes, rather then of the thing ſignified. Laſtly, the outward feeding by bread & wine, repreſents the inward

feeding, by the body and bloud of Chriſt: & yet there is no outward feeding by bread and wine, becauſe there is no bread and wine, except they will make accidents to

               20. Out of this ſnare they ſeeke to ridde themſelues by a double euaſion; firſt, they ſay, that accidents may be without a ſubiect, though not naturally, yet by the ſupernaturall powerBell. de Euchar. lib. 3. cap. 24. of God. This is Bellarmines: and hee prooueth it by two inſtances; firſt, becauſe Saint Baſil affirmeth, that That light which was created the firſt day, was without a ſubiect: and ſecondly, becauſe as the ſubſtance of Chriſts humanitie had no ſubſiſtance in it ſelfe, but in the word; ſo, though an accident naturally doth inhere in a ſubiect, yet ſupernaturally it may bee, and yet not inhere. To this I anſwere: firſt, that though Saint Baſil be of that opinion, yet Saint Auguſtine isAu

                     . in Ger. ad Li

                     . lib. 1. ca. 3. not; for he thought it to be a ſpirituall and no naturall light. Nor Beda, Lyran

                     s, and the maſter of ſentences, who ſuppoſed

                        ide lib. 2. cap. 7. it to be a bright and lightſome cloude▪ which was carried about, and gaue light vnto the world. Nor Damaſcene, who ſuppoſed that this light proceeded from the element of fire, as an effect thereof. Nor yet the Fathers, who though they differed in their opinions touching this light, yet none of them were of Saint Baſils mind, to thinke that it was an accident without a ſubiect. Now, why ſhould we beleeue Saint Baſil herein, more then S. Auguſtine, venerable Bede, Damaſcene, or the reſt? This therefore is but one priuate mans opinion, croſſed by many others, and ſo maketh little for his purpoſe.
               21. Secondly, I anſwere, that though the humanitie of Chriſt had no ſubſiſtance in it ſelfe, yet by reaſon of the vnion with the God-head, it was ſuſtained and vpholden by it: but there is no ſuch vnion betwixt the accidents in the Sacraments, and the body and bloud of Chriſt, that the body and bloud of Chriſt ſhould ſuſtaine and vphold thoſe accidents: and therefore they themſelues ſay, that they are not ſuſtained

by the body of Chriſt, but by the extraordinary power of God; and ſo this inſtance maketh nothing for this purpoſe neither. Laſtly, I anſwere, that we are not ſo much to conſider what God can doe by his omnipotent power, as what he hath done heretofore, or what he hath ſaid hee will doe hereafter: let them therefore ſhew, that accidents haue beene without a ſubſtance in times paſt, or that God hath ſaid, hee will haue them ſo to be, and then wee will yeeld vnto them: but till then wee haue more reaſon to hold concluſions of nature not croſſed by religion, then to relye vpon ſupernaturall imaginations.
               22. The ſecond euaſion is by Aquinas, who affirmeth that
                     Aquin. par. 3. q. 77. art. 6. ſupernaturally, the accidents of bread and wine may nouriſh, becauſe they receaue miraculouſly the ſtrength and vertue of a ſubſtance, and that they doe nouriſh he proueth, becauſe by the ſame reaſon they may be turned into the ſubſtance of the body, by the which they are turned into aſhes & wormes: and alſo becauſe wee ſee by experience that the body is nouriſhed by the ſignes in the Sacrament: to which a ſhort anſwere will ſuffice: for firſt that there ſhould be ſuch a miraculous nouriſhing by accidents, hath no ground either in experience, or in Scripture. And ſecondly, he ſhould rather conclude, becauſe the body is nouriſhed by outward elements, and they are often conuerted into aſhes and wormes, therefore they are not bare accidents but ſubſtances, then that therefore bare accidents may nouriſh: for let the reader iudge whether concludes more reaſonably, we, when we ſay the elements doe nouriſh the body: therefore they are bodily ſubſtances; or they that thus reaſon, the elements do nouriſh the bodie, therefore accidents without a ſubſtance may nouriſh: and thus the ſnare is not broken, neither are they eſcaped.
               23. A fourth contradiction, and that about the Sacrament,4. Contrad. they hold that the wicked and reprobate receaue the body and bloud of Chriſt in the Sacrament, and yet reape no benefit thereby to their owne ſoules, but rather iudgement and damnation, as if the merits, grace, and vertue of Chriſt could be ſeparated from his perſon: or as if a man could receaue

life, and yet not liue, ſanctification, and not be ſanctified, righteouſnes, and not be righteous, redemption, and not be redeemed: for all theſe is Chriſt made vnto vs, Life, Righteouſnes, Sanctification, and Redemption, as the Scripture teſtifieth.1. Cor. 1. 30. 
                  Bellarmine ſpendeth one whole Chapter in this argument,Bell. de Euchar. lib. 1. cap. 13. to proue that the wicked receiue Chriſt in the Sacrament, and therevpon expreſly affirmeth, that though they receiue him, yet they receiue not his iuſtifying grace, nor his merits, nor the fruit and effect of his death and paſſion together with him. Of the ſame mind is Aquinas, & the reſt of their
                     Aquin. 3. q. 80. art. 1. & 3. Diuines. Now this poſition is contrary both to Scripture, Fathers, and to their owne diuinity. To Scripture, for our Sauiour ſaith in expreſſe words, Whoſoeuer eateth my fleſh, and
                  Ioh. 6. 54. 56. 
                  drinketh my bloud, hath eternall life, and I will raiſe him vp at the laſt day. And againe, He that eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my bloud, dwelleth in me, and I in him. But ſay they, The wicked, yea, the reprobate, eate the very fleſh, and drinke the very bloud of Chriſt. Therefore conclude that they haue eternall life, and dwell in Chriſt, and Chriſt in them: neither can they eſcape by ſaying, that the ſpirituall eating of
                     Bell. de Euchar▪ lib. 1. cap. 6. Aquin. 3. p. q. 
                     
                        ••
                     . art. 2. Chriſt by faith, and not the eating in the Sacrament is here vnderſtood, ſeeing they doe all (for the moſt part) interpret this place of the Sacramentall eating and drinking: but more plaine (if it be poſſible) is that of S. Iohn, Ioh. 5. 12. He that hath the Sonne, hath life: and hee that hath not the Sonne of God, hath not life. From which place thus a man may reaſon, He that hath Chriſt, hath eternall life, but hee that receiueth Chriſt verily & truely, as all the wicked do in the Sacrament by their doctrine, hath Chriſt: therefore the very reprobate, euen Iudas himſelf, hath eternal life, & is ſaued: for either they muſt deny that they receiue Chriſt in the Sacrament; or elſe they muſt grant, being conuicted by theſe Scriptures, that together with him they receiue eternall life.
               25. They reply to this two things, firſt, that the wicked receiue Chriſt onely Sacramentally, and not Spiritually, and therefore they haue no benefite by him: and ſecondly, becauſe they receiue him vnworthily, therefore they receiue

their owne iudgement and not ſaluation, not diſcerning the body and bloud of Chriſt. To which I anſwere, that though they receiue Sacramentally, and vnworthily, yet by their doctrine they receiue v
                     •
                  ry Chriſt: and ſo by theſe Scriptures it muſt needs follow, that they alſo receiue the fruite and effect of his death, which is life and ſaluation. Adde hereunto, that the termes here vſed are generall, both in reſpect of the perſons that receiue, and alſo the manner of receiuing, without any ſuch exception or diſtinction, as they deuiſe: and therfore I conclude, that it is as impoſſible to make a ſeparation betwixt Chriſt and his ſauing grace, as to ſeparate the Sunne from light, fire from heate, or the ſoule from naturall life.
               26. Thus this poſition is an oppoſition to Scripture, ſo it is alſo to the opinions of the Fathers. To giue a taſte of ſome two or three, Origen ſaith, That Chriſt is that true meat, which
                  
                     Orig. in Mat. cap. 15. Auguſt. de Ciuit. lib. 21. c. 25. 
                  whoſoeuer eateth ſhall liue for euer which no wicked man can eat. Auguſtine more effectually ſaith, Hee that is in the vnity of Chriſts body, that is, a member of Chriſt, he is truely ſaid to eate Chriſts body, and drinke his bloud. Note, hee ſaith truely, to ſignifie that all other eate him falſly, that is in ſhew and not in ſubſtance. And in another place yet more plainely, Hee

                     ent. 339. 
                  which diſagreeth from Chriſt, doth neither eate his fleſh, nor drinke his bloud, though he take the Sacrament of ſo great a thing to his iudgement. Theodoret as plainely ſaith, That Chriſt is
                  
                     Theodor. in Pſal. 32. Cyril. in Ioh. lib. 4. Baſil. in. Pſal. 3. 
                  meate for his owne ſheepe onely, that is, his elect. And Cyrill that as many as eate his fleſh, haue life in them being ioyned to him who is life it ſelfe. And Baſill ſaith, that they which are fed with the foode of life, to wit, the bread that came downe from heauen, haue an inward mouth of the minde whereby they eate that ſpirituall food. Many more ſuch like ſayings might be heaped together to this purpoſe, which for breuity ſake I paſſe ouer: all which are contrary to that Romiſh poſition, that the wicked eate and drinke the very body and bloud of Chriſt; which they muſt needs doe, if the bread and wine, after the words of conſecration, be changed into the very body and bloud of Chriſt.
               27. Laſtly, it is contrary to their owne diuinity: for they

hold, that the parts of this Sacrament, as of all others, are two, to wit, the matter and the forme: the forme in this SacramentBell de Sacram. lib. 1. cap. 18. is to the whole word of conſecration, together with the ſenſe thereof: the matter is the whole element, with the ſignification thereof. As for example, in the Euchariſt, the matter is the ſpecies of Bread and wine, containing vnder them the body and bloud of Chriſt: and the forme is (for this is my bodie, this is my bloud.) Now, hence I thus reaſon. The wicked either receiue the whole Sacrament, or they receiue it not; if they do, then there is no difference betwixt the faithfull and them, for they receiue no more; and why ſhould not they be ſaued then as well as they? if they do not, then either they receiue not Chriſt at all, becauſe we are ſure they receiue the outward Elements: and therfore if any thing be wanting, it muſt needs be the thing ſignified, or there are more parts then theſe two of the Sacrament. Againe thus if the wicked receiue Chriſt in the Sacrament, and yet not the vertue of Chriſt, then they receiue not the whole Sacrament, becauſe the vertue of the Sacrament is in the Sacrament, as the vertue of euery thing is in the thing it ſelfe. And ſo it followeth, that the wicked in the Sacrament receiue Chriſt, and yet not Chriſt the whole Sacrament, and yet but a part of the Sacrament: and that there are but two parts of it, and yet more then two. Obſerue (gentle Reader) theſe contradictions, and wonder.
               28. Againe, Tranſubſtantiation is contradicted both by the5. Contrad. doctrine of adoration of Images, and by the Canon of the Maſſe: by the doctrine of adoration of Images thus; they teach that diuine adoration is to be giuen to the pictures, of Chriſt, and God the Father, becauſe they repreſent their moſt excellent and diuine perſons, and yet they would haue the very body and bloud of Chriſt to be in the Sacrament tranſubſtantiated, becauſe ſome of the Fathers pretend 
                     •
                  o ſay, that it is to be adored with diuine worſhip. Now, if it bee true that they ſay, that Images of God the Father, and of Chriſt our Sauiour, ought to be adored with diuine worſhip, becauſe they repreſent their perſons: then it muſt bee falſe, that therfeore

the bodie and bloud of Chriſt are really and carnally in the Sacrament, becauſe it is to be worſhipped: for, why may not thoſe myſteries of bread and wine inſtituted by Chriſt, to put vs in mind of his death and paſſion, bee, for ſuch their effectuall repreſentation, adored and worſhipped with diuine worſhip, as well as Images and pictures for their repreſentation, eſpecially ſeeing they carrie a more exact reſemblance and liuely ſignification of him then any picture can doe? Here is a plaine contradiction betwixt the proofe of their Tranſubſtantiation, and their doctrine of adoration of Images, ſtanding vpon theſe termes, An Image muſt be worſhipped, becauſe it repreſenteth the perſon of Chriſt: but the Sacrament is not to bee worſhipped, though it repreſents Chriſt more fully then any Image, except he be corporally and ſubſtantially preſent in it.
               29. Secondly, it is croſſed by the Canon of the Maſſe diuers6. Contrad. waies: Firſt, by the praier that is vſed before the eleuation, where the Prieſt deſireth God to behold the ſame ſacrifice with a propitious and fauourable countenance, like as the ſacrifices of Abel, Abraham, Melchizedech &c. If Chriſt were really offered by the Prieſt, hee need not pray that God would be propitious to that ſacrifice, for in him hee is euer well pleaſed: neither can his ſacrifice be poſſibly diſreſpected of God, being of infinite merite and price to ſatisfie the rigour of his Fathers iuſtice: it were therefore either horrible blaſphemy in their Maſſe to equalize this abſolute ſacrifice of Chriſt, with the imperfect ſacrifices of Abel, and Abraham, which ſtood in need of Gods mercifull acceptation: or it is falſe, that Chriſt is really ſacrificed in the Maſſe: one of the two muſt needs be either blaſphemy in the Canon of the Maſſe, or falſhood in their doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation.
               30. Againe, by another prayer which is vſed in the conſecration,7. Contrad. where the Prieſt prayeth, that God would command thoſe things to be carried by the hands of the holy Angell vp to the high Altar, into the ſight of the diuine Maieſtie. Now by theſe words (thoſe things haec) cannot bee vnderſtood Chriſt, neither in Grammaticall conſtruction, nor in any religious

ſenſe: for in true Grammaticall Latine, he ſhould haue ſaid, if he had ment Chriſt, either hunc, this; or hoc, viz. ſacrifici
                        ••
                     
                   this ſacrifice, and not haec, theſe things: for though the elements be two, yet by their own doctrine whole Chriſt is in each of them, and therefore cannot bee ſpoken of in the plurall number, as if he were either diuided in himſelfe, or multiplied to more then himſelfe: & in the conſtruction of religion it can be no leſſe then blaſphemy to imagine, that an Angell muſt carry vp Chriſt into Heauen, and preſent him there vpon the high Altar to the diuine maieſtie; for it implieth in him either inability, or vnwillingneſſe to preſent himſelfe: to ſay he is vnable, is to deny him to be God, and ſo Almighty: and to ſay he is vnwilling, is to deny him to bee our high Prieſt and Mediatour, to whoſe office it onely pertaineth to offer vp the ſacrifices of the faithfull vnder the Goſpell, as the Prieſt in the law of Moſes might onely offer the ſacrifices of the law, and enter into the moſt holy place, to make reconciliation for the people: ſo that it remaineth, that the compoſer of the Maſſe could not vnderſtand by (haec) theſe things, Chriſt himſelfe: but the elements Bread and Wine which are a repreſentation and commemoration of that one all-ſufficient ſacrifice on the Croſſe: and ſo either the Maſſe is erronious, or Tranſubſtantiation a falſe doctrine; for if the Maſſe be true, then Tranſubſtantiation is falſe; and if Tranſubſtantiation be true, then the Maſſe is falſe.
               31. Thirdly, it is croſſed by their manifold croſſings, vſed8. Contrad. by the Prieſt in the Maſſe: for, if Chriſt in perſon bee really preſent, as a complete ſacrifice, what neede ſuch ſignings or croſſings by the earthly hands of a ſinfull Prieſt? is hee ſanctified by them? that were blaſphemy to thinke. He needeth no ſanctification, being the Holy of holies. Is the diuell driuen away by theſe meanes? that is a greater blaſphemy to beleeue: for hee once conquered the diuell, in ſuch ſort, that he dareth neuer meddle with him any more. And yet the blaſphemous Ieſuites are not afraid to affirme, that the diuels may, and doe ſo come neere to their Sacrament, that they
                     Suar
                           •
                        z. tom. 3. l. 55. ſect. 1. can both carry it away, and abuſe it alſo. Surely, if this bee

true, then the diuels know, Chriſt is not there: for they durſt not come ſo neere vnto him ſacrificed on the Altar, by whoſe true ſacrifice on the Croſſe, they receiued ſuch a deadly wound. Laſtly, is God put in minde of his Sonnes ſacrifice on the Croſſe, by their croſſings of him vpon the Altar? This is impudency to thinke: for Almighty God cannot forget the ſacrifice of his owne Sonne; neyther can his Croſſe bee any whit dignified by their croſſings. Which way ſoeuer they turne them, here is eyther impietie in their Maſſe, or falſity in their doctrine of Tranſsubſtantiation.
               32. Thus much touching the contradictions in the Euchariſt.9. Contrad. Now let vs ſee their concordance in other Articles of their Religion; and that with greater breuitie. And firſt in their Article of Iuſtification, therein there lurke foure maine contradictions: Firſt, they ſay, that the firſt iuſtification, when
                  
                     Cenſur. Colon. pag. 140, 141. Becan. diſput. pag. 199. Trident. Concil. ſeſſ. 6. cap. 6. Bell▪ de Iuſtif. lib. 1. cap. 13. Ibid cap. 17. 
                  a man of vniuſt and wicked, is made iuſt and good, is the free gift of God, and deſerued by no precedent works▪ and yet they ſay againe, that a man doth prepare and make himſelfe fit for this iuſtification by certayne acts of faith, Feare, Hope, Repentance, and the purpoſe of a new life. Yea, Bellarmine doth not ſticke to ſay, that this faith iuſtifieth by way of merite, and deſerueth forgiueneſſe of ſinnes after a certaine manner. And all of them 
                     •
                  each, that thoſe diſpoſitions and preparations ariſe partly from grace, and partly from free-will, as two ſeuerall and deuided agents, and that it is in the power of mans will, eyther to accept that grace of God, or to refuſe it: as hath beene at large diſcouered in the fourth Reaſon. Now heare the contradictions: If it bee meerely Gods free gift, then it is no wayes mans free-will: and if it bee any waies mans free-will to prepare himſelfe, then it is not euery way Gods free gift▪ For it is not in this caſe, as in other externall donations: the King may giue a pardon freely, and yet the priſoner may haue power to receiue or to refuſe the pardon, becauſe the pardon is one thing, and the priſoners will on other: but in the iuſtification of a ſinner, the gift it ſelfe is the very change of the minde, and the will, and the whole man: for it is (as they ſay) when a ſinner is made righteous, and an vniuſt man is
                  
                  made iuſt: and ſo the will hath no power to reiect it, when God effectually giues it; nor power to accept it, till God alter and change it by his grace. And hence it followeth, that to ſay it is Gods free gift, and yet that we in part prepare our ſelues thereunto by our owne free-will, implyeth contradiction, as alſo this, to merite it, and yet to haue it freely giuen: if it be any wayes of merite, then it is not euery way free. Merite in the receiuer, and freeneſſe in the giuer, can in no reſpect ſtand together.
               33. Another contradiction in this Article, is this; that they10. Contrad. ſay a man is iuſtified by his works; and yet for all that, he is iuſtified by grace too. Both theſe propoſitions they peremptorily defend, and take it in great ſcorne, that we charge them to be maintayners of works againſt grace: and call vs loud Lyers, in caſting that imputation vpon them. But by their leaues, they maintaine either works againſt grace, or elſe they breathe hote and cold out of one mouth (which the Satyre could not endure) and ſpeake contraries, let them chooſe whether: for the holy Ghoſt himſelfe placeth theſe two, Works and Grace, in diametrall oppoſition; If it be of grace, it is no
                  Rom. 11. 6. 
                  more of works, or elſe were grace no more grace: but if it bee of works, it is no more grace; or elſe were worke no more worke. Here we ſee a manifeſt oppoſition betwixt grace and works, ſo that one doth exclude the other, and this in our election: and therefore much more in our iuſtification, which is but an effect thereof: for election hath nothing to doe with our good works, according to our doctrine, nor with our euill, according to theirs: but iuſtification hath reſpect vnto our ſinnes and euill deeds; and therefore much greater muſt bee the oppoſition in this then in that: & greater reaſon that here works ſhould be excluded by grace, then in the other.
               34 Bellarmines exception is, that the Apoſtle here excludeth
                     Bell. de Iuſtiſ. lib. 1. cap. 21. onely the works that be of our ſelues without grace, before we be iuſtified: but as for thoſe that come after, they are works of grace, and therefore be not excluded by grace, but may well ſtand together. To which I anſwere three things: Firſt, that the Apoſtle hath no ſuch diſtinction, but ſpeaketh

generally of all works; and therefore according to the olde rule, Vbi lex non diſtinguit: Where the law diſtinguiſheth not, there we muſt not diſtinguiſh. To ſay therefore that it is both by grace and works, is to confront the Apoſtle, and to faſten vpon him a flat contradiction. Yea, it is to extinguiſh grace vtterly: for as it hath beene before alledged out of Auguſtine, grace is not grace in any reſpect, except it bee free in euery reſpect. Secondly, that the Apoſtle meaneth works after grace, and ſuch as proceed from faith, as well as works of nature, appeareth by another like place; where works are alſo excluded, and oppoſed to the free gift of God, that is, toEpheſ. 2. 8. grace: and that the Apoſtle intendeth works of grace, appeareth by the reaſon following in the next verſe (For we are his workmanſhip, created in Chriſt to good works.) Now in this laſt place, works of grace muſt needs be vnderſtood, becauſe he ſaith, we are created in Chriſt Ieſus vnto them: and therefore the ſame alſo muſt neceſſarily bee meant in the former: vnleſſe wee will ſay, that the Apoſtle, or rather the holy Ghoſt, diſputes not ad idem. Laſtly, I anſwere, that in Abrahams iuſtification, who was the Father of the faithfull, andRom. 4. 2. his iuſtification a patterne, how all his ſpirituall poſteritie ſhould be iuſtified, works of grace are excluded: for at that time, of which the Apoſtle there ſpeaketh, Abraham was regenerate, as Bellarmine himſelfe acknowledgeth: and yet his works are excluded: therefore works of grace are meant by the Apoſtle. I, but replyeth the ſame Cardinall, when the ApoſtleBell. Ibid. c. 19. ſaith, that Abraham was iuſtified by faith, and not by works, he excludeth thoſe works which Abraham might doe without faith: for they which haue faith, yet doe not alwaies worke by faith: as when they ſinne, or performe meere morall duties, without relation to God. But this is no better then a meere ſhift, without any ground of reaſon or truth: for if it bee true which the Scripture ſaith, that whatſoeuer is not of faith, is ſinne; then thoſe morall works, which hee mentioneth, being not of faith, are no better then ſinnes, and ſo need not to bee excluded by the Apoſtle; for they exclude themſelues. Beſides, it is manifeſtly falſe, that a iuſt,

and faithfull man, doth any worke, which is not ſinne, wherein he hath not relation vnto God; if not in the particular act, yet in the generall purpoſe of his minde: for, euery morning he prayeth to God for the direction of all his wayes, and that all his works may be ſanctified by his Spirit. And thus it appeareth, that in ſaying, wee are iuſtified by grace, and yet by works too, they ſpeake contraries.
               35. A third contradiction in this Article is about their11. Contrad. works of Preparation, which, they ſay, goe before the firſt iuſtification: theſe they call, vertuous diſpoſitions, good qualities,Bell. de Iuſtif. l. 1. cap. 21. Biſhop. contra Reſor. Cathol. art. 35. good preparations, merits of congruitie; and that they haue a dignitie of worke in them: and yet they ſay agayne, that no good works goe before the firſt iuſtification: belike then they are both good, and not good, by their doctrine: and therefore thus I argue: If they be not good, why do they call them good? if they bee good, then it is vntrue, that no good works go before the firſt iuſtification of a ſinner: either in the one, or in the other, they muſt needs erre; and in holding both, the one part of their doctrine croſſeth the other.
               36. Fourthly, they ſay, that faith alone doth not iuſtify:12. Contrad. Bell. de Iuſtif. lib. 1. cap. 13. Oſor. Dom. 23. poſt Pentec. con. 2. Milet. contra Heſhuſ.
                   and yet, notwithſtanding, they ſay, Fide Catholica Chriſtiana eaque ſola hominem iuſtificari, nulli vnquam negauerunt, nec 
                        •
                     egant Pontificij. That no Papiſt euer hath, or doth deny, that a man is iuſtified by the Catholike Chriſtian faith, and that alone. This is the aſſertion of Miletus, againſt Heſhuſius; and it is not condemned by any of the reſt; but his booke approued as contayning nothing contrary to their Catholike Religion: and ſo it ſeemes to be one of their Catholike doctrines. And Bellarmine inſinuates aſmuch, though not in playneBell. Ibid. ſpeech, yet by neceſſary conſequence, when bee ſaith, that faith is the beginning, and firſt roote of iuſtification. Now if it be ſo, then as ſoone as a man hath faith, iuſtification is begun, and taketh roote in him, euen before he hath any other grace: and if it hath taken roote, then it is eyther whole iuſtification, or a peece thereof: but a peece it cannot be; for it is indiuiſible; therefore, eyther whole or none. For grant there be degrees in iuſtification (as they ſay) which neuertheleſſe

they are neuer able to prooue: yet they bee degrees of perſection, not of eſſence: as a man is a man as ſoone as hee is borne, though not a perfect man before hee come to complete age, ſtature, and ſtrength. So their ſuppoſed iuſtification, is iuſtification in the roote, though not perfect and abſolute, vntill it come to ripe age. I ſpeake in their language, becauſe I deliuer their owne doctrine. Now how can theſe two contraries bee reconciled? Faith alone doth not iuſtify, and yet faith alone doth iuſtify? If they ſay, that they ſpeake of one kinde of faith, and we of another, they ſay nothing to the purpoſe: for euen that any faith alone ſhould iuſtify, is contrary to their owne poſitions, who affirme, that the former cauſe of our iuſtification, is the inherent righteouſnes ofBell. de Iuſtif. lib. 1. cap. 18. works: and not the righteouſnes of Chriſt, apprehended by faith. And thus I leaue the Article of iuſtification at farre with it ſelfe, to be atoned by their beſt wits, if it be poſſible.
               37. Let vs come to their doctrine of workes, and ſee how13. Contrad. that agreeth with it ſelfe: and here firſt they hold, that works done before faith and regeneration, are not good workes, but ſinnes. This is proued by them out of Saint Auguſtine, whoAug. lib. 4. in Julian. cap. 3. affirmeth, that the workes of vnbeleeuers are ſinnes: and if the workes of vnbeleeuers, then of all other wicked men which bee not regenerate; ſeeing, as the ſame Father elſe-where ſpeaketh, Impij cogitant, non credunt, the wicked doe not beleeue, but thinke; they haue but a ſhadow of faith, without ſubſtance. It may be prooued alſo by that generall and infallible axiome of the holy Scripture, Whatſoeuer is not of faith, is ſinne: but the workes of wicked men are all voyd of faith, and therefore are no better then ſinnes in the ſight of God, be they neuer ſo glorious and beautifull in the eyes of men. OrNazianz. orat. in ſanct. Lauac. as Gregorie Nazianzene ſaith, As faith without workes is dead, ſo workes without faith are dead: and dead workes are ſinnes, as appeares, Heb. 9. 41. Beſides, Bellarmine confirmeth the ſame by reaſon, becauſe they want a good intention to direct their workes to the glory of the true God, whome they are ignorant of. To which I adde another reaſon drawne from our Sauiours owne mouth, Mat. 7. Becauſe an euill tree cannot bring
                  
                  forth good fruit: but euery man, til he be ingrafted into Chriſt, is no better then an euill tree, and therefore cannot doe a good worke.
               38. This is their doctrine, and it is ſound diuinitie: but ſee how they croſſe it ouer the face with a contrary falſhood; for the ſame men that teach this, notwithſtanding affirme, that the workes of Infidels are good, ſuo genere, in their kind:Bell, de iuſtif. lib. 4. cap. 16. ſo they are good, and not good; ſinnes, and yet good works: but this is in their kind, ſay they, that is, Morally, and not Theologically. I, but morall vertues in the vnregenerate are (by their owne principles) ſinnes: how then can they be good any waies? Can ſinne, which is a tranſgreſſion of Gods law, and ſimply in it owne nature euill, be in any reſpect good, as it is ſinne? But to take cleare away this ſcruple, another of them auoucheth, that they are not onely morally, but euen Theologically good; for he ſaith, that ſuch works as are doneSalmer. Jeſuit. tit. 15. pag. 41. by the light of nature onely, without grace, doe diſpoſe and make a man in ſome ſort fit to iuſtification, though it be longè & valdèremotè, remotely, and a farre off; for he that yeeldeth obedience to morall lawes, is thereby leſſe vndiſpoſed and repugnant to diuine grace. Now, how can ſinnes diſpoſe or prepare a man for iuſtification? is God delighted with ſinnes? Either therefore they are not ſinnes, or they doe not diſpoſe to iuſtification, neither farre nor neere: or which is the preſent contradiction, they are ſinnes and not ſinnes, good and not good, at one time, and in one and the ſame reſpect. And to put the contradiction out of all queſtion, the Councill of Trent in the ſeuenth Canon of the ſixt Seſſion, enacteth asConcil. Trident. Seſſ. 6. ca. 7. much, and denounceth Anathema to all that ſay the contrarie: the words are theſe, If any man ſhall ſay, that all the works which are done before iuſtification, by what meanes ſoeuer they are done, are truely ſinnes, or deſerue the hatred of God, let him be Anathema. And Andradius the interpretor of that Councill,Andradius. authoriſed by the Fathers of the ſame, doth more perſpicuouſly explaine the meaning of that Canon, when hee ſaith, that men without faith, deſtitute of the ſpirit of regeneration may doe workes which are voyde of all filthineſſe, free from all fault,
                  
                  and defiled with no ſinne, and by which they may obtaine ſaluation: then which, what can be more contradictory to that which before was deliuered, that all the workes of Infidels and vnbeleeuers are ſinnes, be they neuer ſo gliſtering with morall vertue? or more agreeable to the olde condemned errors of Iuſtine, Clemens, and Epiphanius, who affirmed that Socrates, and Her aclitus were Chriſtians, becauſe they liued according to the rule of reaſon: and that the Grecians were iuſtified by Philoſophie: and that many were ſaued onely by the law of nature, without the lawe of Moſes, or Goſpell of Chriſt?
               
               39. Againe, their doctrine of doubel merit, the one of14. Contrad. Congruity, the other of Condignity, as they terme them, is not onely contrary to the truth, but to it ſelfe. For this they teach, that the merit of congruity, which the Councill of Trent calleth the preparations and diſpoſitions to iuſtification, is grounded vpon the dignity of the worke, and not vpon the promiſe of God: but the merit of condignity requireth both a dignity of the worke, and the promiſe of God to bee grounded vpon, or elſe it is no merit. This is Bellarmines
                  Bell. de Iuſtif. lib. 1. cap. 21. plaine doctrine, and is conſonant to the reſidue of their Doctours, both Schoole diuines, and others: for thus they define the merit of congruity, It is that by which the ſubiect is
                  Compend. Theol. lib. 5. cap. 11. 
                  diſpoſed, that it may receiue grace according to the reaſon of Gods iuſtice. Here is onely iuſtice required, and not any promiſe to the merit of congruity; though (I muſt confeſſe) Gabriel Biel
                  Gabriel. 3. Sent. diſt. 27. ſomewhat croſſeth this definition, when 
                     •
                  e ſaith, that when a man doth what in him lyeth, then God accepteth his worke, and powreth in grace, not by the due of Iuſtice, but of his liberalitie. And Aquinas, who affirmeth, that when a man vſeth well the
                  Aquinas. 2. 2 ae. q. 114. art. 2. Coſter. Enchir. pag. 284. 
                  power of free-will, God worketh in him according to the excellencie of his mercy. But yet they all agree in this, that the merit of congruity is not grounded vpon any promiſe, as the merit of condignity is, but onely vpon the worthin
                     •
                  s of the worke done. Now here lurketh a flat contradiction, for by this it ſhould follow, that the merit of congruity ſhould bee more properly a merit then that of condignity. Which Bellarmine denyeth in the ſame Chapter, becauſe this dependeth vpon it

owne dignity, and hath no neede of a promiſe, as the other hath: and ſo ſhould bee alſo more meritorious and excellent then the other; being neuertheleſſe but a preparation and beginning to iuſtification, and the other the matter of iuſtification it ſelfe. And that a man that hath no grace dwelling in him▪ but onely outwardly mouing him, nor is yet iuſtified, ſhould haue more power to deſerue and merite, then he that is fulfilled with grace, and fully iuſtified. Thus error, like a Strumpet, bringeth foorth a monſtrous brood of abſurdities: but let vs proceede.
               40. Their merite of condignitie bringeth foorth a like15. Contrad. monſter; for they build it vpon two foundations, whereofBell. de Iuſtif. lib. 1. cap. 21. Coſter. Enchir. pag. 284. &c. Aquin. 1. 2. q. 114. art. 6. Bell. de Iuſtif. lib. 5. cap. 14. Coſter. Enchir. pag. 285. Bell. de Juſtif. lib. 5. cap. 17. one ouerwhelmeth the other: to wit, the dignity of the worke, and the promiſe of God: for what can be more contrary, then mercy and iuſtice? Now if it depend vpon the dignity of the worke, then it is a due of iuſtice: and ſo they call it, Meritum ex iuſtitia. A merite by iuſtice: but if it rely vpon the free promiſe of God (as they call it,) then it muſt needs be, Meritum ex miſericordia. A merite by mercy: for Gods promiſe is a voluntary fruit of his mercy. They anſwer, that they may both well ſtand together: for, ſay they, God dealeth with vs, as we deale with our hyred labourers; we agree with them for a certayne price, for doing a peece of worke, and when they begin, we giue them an earneſt penny; and when the worke is done, according to the couenant, we giue them their wages: So dealeth Almighty God with Chriſtians; he firſt maketh a couenant with them, that for labouring in his Vineyard they
                  Mat. 20. 2. 
                  ſhall haue a penny, that is, eternall life: then he giueth them the
                  Epheſ. 1. 13. 
                  earneſt of his Spirit, to aſſure them thereof: and laſtly, at the end, when they haue done their worke, hee payeth them their wages.
                  Apoc▪ 22. 12. But by the Ieſuites leaue, this ſimilitude is lame of all foure: for firſt, when a man hyreth a labourer, and bargaineth with him for wages for his worke: this is a couenant of iuſtice, and no promiſe of mercy: and therefore if he performe this bargaine, hee is not therefore called mercifull, but iuſt: but Almighty God, as they themſelues confeſſe, promiſeth freely, and is bound to none: and therefore this muſt needs

be a worke of mercy, and not of iuſtice. Secondly, there is a proportion betwixt the labourers worke and his hire: but betwixt the Kingdome of heauen, and our good works, there is no proportion, no more then betwixt a finite, and an i
                     •
                   finite thing: or a drop of a B
                     •
                  cket, and the huge Ocean. And third y a man ſtandeth in need of his workman & his worke: but God hath no need of vs. And hence it muſt of neceſſitieIob. 35. 7. follow, that the labourers hire i
                     •
                   a debt of iuſtice: but a Chriſtians hire is a reward of mercy. And ſo I conclude, that being of mercy, it cannot be of iuſtice too; or if it be of iuſtice, it cannot be of mercy t

                   beſeech you, how falſehood needeth no other Engine but it ſelfe to ouerthrow it.
               42. Laſtly, concerning works, their doctrine is, that the17. Contrad. Concil. Trident Seſſ. 6. cap. 11. can. 25. Bell. de Iuſtif. lib. 4. cap. 10. good works of the regenerate are fully and abſolutely iuſt, and perfectly good: and yet neuertheleſſe, that they may grow in goodneſſe, and are alſo mixed with many veniall ſinnes. If they bee perfectly good, how can they grow in goodneſſe? and if they increaſe in goodneſſe, how are they perfectly good, ſeeing that onely is perfect, to which nothing can be added? If they ſay that this perfection is but begun, and not finiſhed; why then alſo, they ſhould ſay, that they are imperfectly perfect: or elſe, they pull downe with one hand, that which they build with the other. And againe, if they, moſt holy and iuſt men, haue their works intermixed with many veniall ſins, for which they need to cry daily, Forgiue vs our treſpaſſes, how can they either perfectly fulfill the law of God, or doe ſuch works as may bee able to abide the cenſure of Gods iuſtice, ſeeing Saint Iames ſaith, that he that tranſgreſſeth one Commandement,Iam. 2. 10. 
                  is guiltie of the whole law, becauſe he violateth the body of iuſtice, contained in the law? as he which hurteth the little toe, doth herein wrong the whole bodie. It is a contradiction therefore, to ſay, that the works of the regenerate are perfect, and yet are intermingled with many ſinnes: and it is all one, as if a man ſhould ſay, that his face is perfectly cleane, and yet hath many ſpots: or that the bodie is perfectly in health, and yet is peſtred with many diſeaſes.
               43. And thus much of good works. Now, beſides theſe,18. Contrad. there are certaine works in their Religion, which are more then good, and more perfect then perfection: theſe be their works of Supererogation, ariſing from three grounds: Firſt,Bel. de Monach. lib. 2. cap. 6. 7. when the Saints in this life do more good works, then are neceſſarie for themſelues to the attainment of ſaluation. And ſecondly, when they ſuffer more and greater puniſhments then are due vnto them for their ſinnes. And thirdly, when they vndertake, no
                     •
                   onely works, commanded by the law of God▪ but alſo, ſuch as are commended by the Euangelicall Councells: as, voluntary pouertie, abſtayning from marriage,
                  
and regular obedience. Theſe ſuperabounding actions and paſſions of Gods Saints, are the works of ſupererogation, ſpoken of, and magnified ſo much in the Church of Rome: which both are the Churches Treaſure, mingled with the ſuperabounding merits of Chriſts paſſion; and are layd vp in a Treaſury, the keyes whereof and diſpenſation is committed to the Pope of Rome, that hee, either by himſelfe or his Factors, may diſpence them at his pleaſure: that is, to them that will buy the ſame for money: and alſo (as they ſay) are more excellent, and perfect, and meritorious of a greater reward. This blaſphemous doctrine might eaſily be woūded to death by the Sword of the Spirit: for it is contrary to all Religion, & to the experience of euery mans owne conſcience. But I leaue this to others, who haue, or ſhall meddle in this argument: my taske is to ſhew, how it contradicteth both it ſelfe, and other doctrines of their Religion.
               44. It ſelfe, thus: They teach, that works of ſupererogation,Bell. Ibid. grounded vpon Euangelicall Counſels, are (as you haue heard) more excellent, perfect, and meritorious, then thoſe which are done in obedience to the law of God: and that in three reſpects: Firſt, comparing ſeuerall Counſels with ſeuerall Precepts which concerne the ſame matter: As, to ſell all and giue to the poore, is a more excellent worke, then any commanded in that Precept, Thou ſhalt not ſteale. And the Counſell of Single life, is more perfect then the Precept, Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery. As if men could bee more perfect then God had commanuded, or then Chriſt himſelfe was, whoſe righteouſnes conſiſted in this, in being obedient to hisHeb. 10. 7. Pſal. 103. 20. Fathers will. Or then the Angels, whoſe perfection conſiſteth in executing the Commandements of God. Or, as if the law of God was not a perfect rule of righteouſnes. Secondly, comparing the ſtate of men, obſeruing Euangelicall Counſells, with the ſtate of them that onely yeeld obedience to Precepts: as if a man could be in a higher and happier eſtate then they are, which loue God with all their heart; and their Neighbour as themſelues: which is the ſumme of the Law. And thirdly, (marke this) comparing Counſells with any

precept whatſoeuer, euen with that great Commaundement of the Law, Thou ſhalt loue the Lord thy God with all thy heart,
                  Mat. 22. 37. 38. 
                  and with all thy ſtrength. As if a man could loue God more then with all his heart, and with all his ſtrength. Gods children labour for ſo much, let them take the more for their ſhares. Hence they conclude, that in reſpect of matter, the Precept is good; but the Counſels better: and in reſpect ofBell. de Mona h. lib. 2. cap. 7. the end, the fulfilling of Precepts hath a reward; but the execution of Counſels hath a greater reward. This is their plaine doctrine. And yet neuertheleſſe the ſame men teach, that the perfection of a Chriſtian man conſiſteth eſſentially, in the obſeruation of Precepts: and inſtrumentally, in the obſeruationBell. Ibid, c. 6. of Counſels. And ſecondly, that the Precepts of charitie are the ends whereunto Counſels are ordayned: and the works of Counſels are but the way and meanes for the betterAquin. 2. 2. q. 184. art. 3. Idem. Ibid. q. 189. Salmer. c. 7. pag. 37. keeping of the Precepts. Now to the purpoſe. How can works of ſupererogation bee more perfect then works of obedience? Counſels then Precepts? ſeeing perfection conſiſteth in the one inſtrumentally, and in the other eſſentially, and Precepts are the end of Counſels, and not Counſels of Precepts? Is an inſtrumentall perfection greater then an eſſentiall? or the meanes more perfect then the end? This is contrary to naturall reaſon: for Ariſtotle ſaith, Maius bonum
                  Ariſtot. Rethor. lib. 1. cap. 7. 
                  eſt finis, quàm quod finis non eſt. The end is a greater good then that which is not the end: and the inſtrument is neuer ſo perfect as the eſſence of a thing.19. Contrad. Concil.

               45. Againe, it croſſeth another of their doctrines thus: They teach, that though the law of God bee poſſible to bee kept by the regenerate, & the works of the faithfull be ſimply and abſolutely iuſt: yet they are mixed with many veniall ſinnes: and therefore there is none ſo iuſt, but that ſinneth ſometimes, and hath neede to vſe that petition in the Lords Prayer daily, Forgiue vs our treſpaſſes. According to that generall axiome of Sain: Iames, In many things wee ſinne all. Yea, Bellarmine himſelfe affirmeth, that the regenerate may fall into many deadly ſinnes, and that hee cannot poſſibly auoyd veniall ſinnes, Niſi priuilegio ſingulari: But by a ſingular
                  
                  priuiledge. Which priuiledge hee cannot inſtance to haue beene granted to any man liuing or dead, except Chriſt only, who was God & man. Obſerue now the contradiction: (to omit that this neceſſitie of ſinning doth ouerthrow the poſſibility of fulfilling the law, and doth imply an impoſſibilitie) how can theſe two extremes be reconciled? The regenerate cannot performe all they ſhould do, & yet do performe more then they ſhould do. They cannot auoyd veniall ſins, and yet can ſupererogate. It is as much as to ſay, that a man is not able to pay his owne debts, but muſt aske pardon for them; & yet hath ability to pay another mans, far greater then his owne. Or, an Archer cannot by any means ſhoot home to the marke & yet with the ſame Bow & Arrowes, ſent forth by the ſame ſtrength of his arme, he can ſhoote farre beyond the marke. He that is tainted and ſtained with many veniall ſinnes, in that reſpect, is not perfect: but hee that doeth ſupererogate, is more then perfect: For ſo they ſay, when they giue a higherBell. de Monach. lib. 2. cap. 2. degree of perfection to theſe works, then to the perfect obedience of the law. If they ſay, that veniall ſinnes doe not hinder the perfection of good works: I anſwere, that neuertheleſſe, they hinder the perfection of the worker: & if they ſtick faſt to the worke it ſelfe, they hinder that alſo: as the leaſt ſpot of inke blemiſheth the whole face, and the lighteſt diſeaſe diſableth the health of the whole body. Eyther therefore they muſt deny them to be ſinnes, and ſo ſpots & defects in the ſoules of the regenerate: or they muſt confeſſe, that they are not ſo perfect as they ſhould be. And how then can they be more perfect then they ſhould be?
               46. Further, they teach, that one degree of ſuperero gating20. Contrad. Bell. de Monach. lib. 2. cap. 8. Salmer. tom. 5. tract. 5. Bell. de Monach. lib. 2. cap. 2. perfection, is the vow of Monaſticall pouerty, renouncing all propriety in worldly goods, and holding in Common the vſe of temporall things: and yet they ſay, that the ſtate of Biſhops, who poſſeſſe lands and goods, and enioy the propriety of them, is more perfect then the ſtate of Monks; who depriue themſelues thereof, becauſe Biſhops haue alreadie atchiued this perfection, and Monks are but in the way to it. From which ground a man may thus argue: If perfection

conſiſt in voluntary pouerty, which is an alienation of all proprietie of worldly goods; then Bſhiops, poſſeſſing Lordſhips and reuenues, are not more perfect then Monks, that haue renounced all: and if Biſhops, poſſeſſing, be more perfect then Monks, not poſſeſſing, then perfection conſiſteth not in the alienation of all proprietie of worldly goods. One or the other muſt needes bee falſe, except hee will place perfection in two contraries: to wit, poſſeſſing, and not poſſeſſing. And the rather may this abſurditie appeare, becauſe, aske them, why Monks are more perfect then other men? they will anſwere, becauſe they remooue from them all impediments of their loue to God (in which ranke they place worldly wealth) and conſecrate themſelues wholly to Gods ſeruice. By which reaſon, Biſhops cannot bee more perfect then either they or other men, becauſe they retayne thoſe impediments: and ſo by their doctrine, doe not wholly conſecrate themſelues to Gods ſeruice.
               47. From their actions, let vs come to their paſſions: to21. Contrad. wit, their Satisfactions, or, as Melanchton calleth them, Satiſpaſſions, wherein there are as fat and foggie contradictions, as in the former. For, firſt they teach, that Chriſt hath made a perfect and full ſufficient ſatisfaction for all the Elect; and thatConcil. Trident. Seſſ. 4. c. 8. Bell. de poenit. lib. 4. cap. 14. Coſter. Enchir. pag. 395. his death was a ſufficient price for the redemption and expiation of the ſinnes of the whole world: and that his ſatisfaction was of infinite valew, &c. This they affirme in ſemblance of words, becauſe, if they ſhould not, all men would cry ſhame vpon their Religion. And yet, in truth, they ouerthrow the ſame by another croſſe doctrine of our owne ſatiſfactions: for the ſame men ſay, that Chriſt hath onely ſatisfied for the fault of our ſinnes, and the eternall puniſhment due vnto them: but wee our ſelues muſt ſatisfie for the temporallConcil. Trident. Seſſ. 4. cap. 10. c. 12. & 13. Bell. de poenit. lib. 4. cap. 4. & 3. & 7. puniſhment, eyther here on earth, by neceſſary afflictions, or in Purgatory, by the indurance of thoſe paynes which are there ordayned to purge men withall. Now what can be more contrary then theſe two propoſitions? Chriſt hath made a full ſatisfaction for vs; and yet we muſt alſo ſatisfie in part for our ſelues. If Chriſts ſatisfaction be full and perfect, then

it hath payd the whole debt which we ought: but if we muſt pay part of the debt, then is not this ſatisfaction full and perfect. That the temporall puniſhment is a part of our debt, Bellarmine himſelfe confeſſeth, writing vpon the fi

                     . cap. 6. of the Lords Prayer, where hee giueth this one reaſon, why ſinnes are called debts: becauſe he which breaketh the Law, is a debter, to vndergoe the puniſhment which the Law requireth. But the Law bindeth tranſgreſſors, not onely to eternall, but alſo to temporary and tranſitory puniſhments. As a Suretie therfore, that payeth for his friend, owing an hundred pound, foureſcoreand ten, leauing the remainder to the debter himſelfe to be ſatisfied, cannot be ſayd, to haue made full ſatisfaction: So, if any part of our debt is to be payed by our ſelues, Chriſt, our all-ſufficient Surety, cannot be ſayd to haue made a full ſatisfaction. But they anſwere, that this our ſatisfactionConcil. Trident.

                     . 4. cap. 14. and ſo to expiate the puniſhment of our ſinnes inſtrumentally, and not cauſally. To which I anſwere: Firſt, that this inwrappeth another contradiction: for, if it bee Chriſts in vs, and not ours of our ſelues, then it muſt needs be the ſatisfaction it ſelfe, and not an inſtrument to apply it: for one and the ſame thing cannot bee both the inſtrument to apply, and the thing that is applyed. But of this ſee more in the fourth reaſon. And ſecondly, though it be from Chriſt, yet that is but in part; becauſe, as they teach, it is not onely in euery mans power, eyther to admit, or to exclude the grace of God, and the efficacy of Chriſts merite, by his owne free-will: but alſo, for that it is wrought by our ſelues, and vpon our ſelues, cooperating with grace at leaſt. And thus the knot of the contradiction remaineth ſtill as faſt tyed as euer it was.
               48. Againe, they ſay, that our ſatisfactions, when they

                     2. Contrad. Bell. de poenit. lib. 4. cap. 1. are at the beſt, are imperfect, and no wayes proportionable to the iuſtice of God: for when we ſinne, we offend him, who is an infinite God; and whatſoeuer we haue, it is but a ſmall and finite thing: and therefore there muſt needes bee an imperfect

compenſation from vs to God, depending rather vpon his mercifull acceptation thē any proportionable ſatisfaction. This is their doctrine. And yet they teach alſo, that there isIdem de poenit. lib. 4. cap. 7. an equalitie and proportion betwixt Gods iuſtice, and our ſatisfactory works: and that they are in ſome ſort of infinite valew, by reaſon of the infinite power of Gods Spirit dwelling in vs, from which they proceede. And thus by their doctrine they are perfect, and not perfect: infinite, and finite: haue equality and proportion, and yet haue no equality nor proportion to Gods iuſtice. Either therefore they are not of infinite valew, though they proceede from the Spirit: or if, becauſe they doe proceede from the Spirit, therefore they are of infinite value, then they cannot bee imperfect. Let them chooſe which they will, they haue a Wolfe by the eares.
               49. Further, they teach, that the paſſions of the Saints doe23. Contrad. Bell. de Indulg. lib. 1. cap. 2. not onely profite themſelues, but alſo others, whether liuing or dead; not ſo much, by example, for their edification, as alſo, for their ſatisfaction, by redeeming them from temporall puniſhment. Which doctrine is not onely contrary toGreg. de Valent. de Indulg. c. 1. Saint Gregory, one of their owne Biſhops, who taught that Chriſts ſufferings are herein diſtinguiſhed from the ſufferingsGreg. Mag. of all others; becauſe hee ſuffered without ſinne, and all men ſuffered with ſinne: but alſo to the receiued doctrine in their Church, which holdeth, that the righteouſnes by imputation, whereby we ſay a man is iuſtified, is a meere fiction and Chimericall conceit. For a man (ſay they) cannot bee righteous by another mans righteouſnes, nor wiſe by another mans wiſedome: and ſo not iuſtified by Chriſts righteouſnes imputed vnto him. Cannot a man be iuſtified by Chriſts righteouſnes imputed? & can ſatisfaction be made by the paſſions of the Saints imputed? Is the death of Chriſt of leſſe p

                  ice & force then the ſufferings of the Saints? The righteouſnes of Chriſt imputed, is a Monſter in Religion; & yet the ſatisfaction of the Saints imputed, is with them a Catholike doctrine. And thus with one doctrine they eſtabliſh imputation, and with the other, pull it downe againe. With one breath they condemne it, and with another they iuſtifie it.

Contrad. for out of this doctrine, That men muſt ſatisfie in themſelues, and for themſelues, for the temporall puniſhment of their ſinnes, ſpringeth Purgatory: becauſe, when they haue not ſatisfied ſufficiently in this life, then (as they teach) they muſt make vp that which is wanting in the life to come, in the fireBell. de Pur at. lib. 1. cap. 7. of Purgatory. This doctrine of Purgatory is directly oppoſite to their Sacrament of Extreme vnction: for there they teach, that by this Sacrament all the reliques of ſinne are vtterly aboliſhed and wiped away. Si quae delicta ſint adbuc expianda abſtergit (ſaith the Councell of Trent:) If any ſinnes
                  Concil Trident. Seſſ. 14. ca. 2. Bell. de extrem. vnct. lib. 1. cap. 8 
                  remayne vnpurged, or to be ſatisfied for, this Sacrament wypeth them cleane away. And the Councell of Florence affirmeth, that the effect of this Sacrament is, Sanatia animae: The healing of the ſoule. And Bellarmine concludeth, that therefore the fiue Senſes are anoynted, becauſe they are, as it were, the fiue doores, by which ſinnes enter in vnto the ſoule: to wit, that there might bee a generall purgation of all ſinnes which remayne. This is their abſolute doctrine: and yet the ſame men affirme, that Purgatory is ordayned to purge away theBell. de Pargat. lib. 1. cap. 7. reliques of ſinnes, which in our life time wee haue not ſatiſfied for: and that many ſinnes ſticke ſo faſt and cloſe vnto vs, that we carry them with vs out of this life, to bee purged in that purging fire. This is alſo their doctrine. Now I would aske of them, if all the reliques of ſin be wyped away by this annoynting Sacrament, then what vſe is there of Purgatory? and if the reliques of ſinne bee to bee purged in Purgatory, then what vſe of this Sacrament? Either therefore this fire doth dry vp the vertue of that ſacramentall Oyle, or this ſacramentall Oyle doth quench that fire. They will ſay, peraduenture, that eyther all are not anoynted with this Oyle 
                     •
                   or that ſome that are anoynted, by their owne infidelity and impenitency, barre out the vertue thereof. Or, laſtly, that the ſinne being remitted, yet the temporall puniſhment due vnto it, is to bee payd in Purgatory. To which I reply: firſt, that it is againſt the rule of their owne Religion, that none that are anoynted with this Oyle, ſhould goe to Purgatory:

for then a very ſmall number ſhould goe to that place, ſeeing their Prieſts are ſo diligent, for their owne belly ſake, that they ſeldome ſuffer any to paſſe away without this Paſport. Secondly, for them which barre out the efficacy of the Sacrament by their owne infidelity or impenitency, not that purging fire of the Suburbs, but the deuouring fire of Hell it ſelfe is prepared, as they themſelues acknowledge. And thirdly, if there be not a purging away of ſome filthy ſtaines of ſinnes from the ſoule by that fire, but onely a ſatisfactory puniſhment, why do they call it a Purgatory? Nay, and why doeth Bellarmine thus define it to bee a place, wherein, as it
                  Bell. de Purgat. lib. 1. cap. 1. & lib. 2. cap. 1. 
                  were in a Priſon, after this life thoſe ſoules are purged, which were not ſufficiently purged in this life; to the end, that being ſo purged, they may enter into heauen, whither no polluted thing can haue admittance? And thus it remaynes a neceſſary concluſion, that either the reliques of ſinne are not clenſed away by Extreme vnction, and ſo that Sacrament is of no force: or, if they be, they are not then purged in Purgatory: and ſo that fire muſt needes be quenched.
               51. But if this Oyle will not ſerue to extinguiſh Purgatorie,25. Contrad. becauſe the fire burneth ſo hot: let vs adde vnto this the Popes Pardons, which will (at leaſt) evacuate and empty it, that there ſhall be no fuell for that fire.

then either the Pope is vnmercifull, if he can, and will not: for who would ſuffer ſuch a number of poore ſoules to bee ſo tormented, when with a word of his mouth he might releaſe them? or, if hee would, and cannot, then their doctrine is falſe of his abſolute Iuriſdiction. Let them chooſe whether they will. But of this, more hereafter. Now to the purpoſe. Some of them hold, that the paynes of Purgatory hold but ten yeeres: ſome, an hundred: ſome, two hundred: they that ſtretch them fartheſt, yet ſay, that they muſt end at the day of Iudgement: becauſe then, all muſt bee Sheepe or Goates, none betwixt both, of middle nature, as Beliarmine affirmeth. Well, then, if Purgatory dure no longer, then we ſhall not neede to feare it no more, then that fire which the Philoſopher calls, Ignis fatuus. For let any man goe to Venice, and ſay but a prayer of Saint Auguſtine, printed in a table, and he ſhall haue 82000. yeeres pardon: that is longer then the world is like to endure by their owne confeſſion, and therefore longer then needes. This indulgence was granted by Pope Boniface the eyghth. Or, if Venice be too farre a iourney, let him ſtay at home, and but nod the head at the Name of Ieſus, and hee ſhall haue twenty yeeres pardon for euery time. I would nod twenty times a day if this were true, and that commeth to 7300. in the yeere. O how a man may diſappoint this Purgatory, if he haue any wit in his head! This Indulgence came from Pope Iohn the two and twentieth. Or, if this be alſo too great a matter, let a man weare but an Agnus Dei about his necke, and thinke onely in his heart on the Name of Ieſus at the houre of his death, and hee ſhall haue plenary forgiuenes of all his ſinnes. And for them that are there already, they are helped out daily, or at leaſt may bee, by the Suffrages and Maſſes of thoſe that are aliue: and if any remaine there, the fault is in the Prieſts, that ſay not Maſſes faſt enough: and the reaſon of that is, becauſe they receiue not money faſt enough: for there is the common Prouerbe moſt true, No penny, no pater noſter. To conclude,

                     1. if all theſe things ſtand true, then Purgatory muſt fall: for who would fall into Purgatory, that may thus eaſily preuent it? or who would ſuffer any of his friends ſoules and acquaintance to lye burning there one houre, when it is in his power thus to redeeme them? Either therefore the doctrine of Pardons is falſe and fayned, or elſe Purgatory is no better then a ſcarcrow.
               52. Adde to theſe, that ſoules onely are tormented in Purgatory,26. Contrad. Bell. de Purgat. lib. 2. cap. 9. and not bodies: but bodies ſinne as well as ſoules: and ſome ſinnes are committed by the whole man, to wit, bodie and ſoule together: and therefore the body is not free from the relicks of ſinnes, no more then the ſoule, eſpecially from obligation vnto temporall puniſhment. How can then theſe relicks bee purged away in this fire, when as the one part of man, which ſtandeth in neede of purging as well as the other, neuer commeth thither? Bellarmine ſawe this contradiction well enough, and therefore labours to ſalue it by a falſe poſition, driuing out one nayle of error with another: to wit, That ſinne is onely an act of free-will;
                  Bell. Ibid. 
                  and therefore, after the diſſolution of the body and ſoule by death, remayneth onely in the ſoule, and not in the dead body. But this is firſt falſe: for albeit properly it is the ſoule that ſinneth, yet the body alſo ſinneth, by being an inſtrument of the ſoule in ſinning: and he himſelfe ſaith, that ſome ſinnes cannot bee committed but a toto compoſite, by the whole man. And if the bodie doe not ſinne as well as the ſoule, I wonder why it is puniſhed both in this life, with corporall diſeaſes and plagues, and after death, with putrefaction and depriuation of life, and in the day of iudgement, with eternall torment in hell fire. Secondly, if it were ſo, that a dead carkaſſe had no relique of ſinne in it, yet in that it was an inſtrument of ſinne, it is lyable to temporall puniſhment, which is the chiefe ground of Purgatory, as hath beene ſhewed. And therefore I conclude, that either the body goeth to Purgatory as well as the ſoule; or elſe a full ſatisfaction is not made for the temporall puniſhment: or at leaſt, that the fire of Purgatory is but an imaginary

and witty conceit to keepe men in ſome awe, and to maintaine their owne pride and pompe.
               53. Next vnto Purgatory, is Prayer for the dead, which27. Contrad. is both the mother and daughter of that fire; for as it is vpheld by Purgatory, a weake and imaginary foundation; ſo it vpholdeth Purgatory, a paper building: neuertheleſſe it is ouerturned by it owne poyſe and weight. For this theyBell. de Purgat. lib. 2. cap. 18. teach, That the prayers and ſuffrages of the liuing, doe nothing profite thoſe that doe enioy bleſſedneſſe, as the Martyrs, and ſuch like: according to that of Saint Auguſtine,
                  Auguſt de verbis Apoſtol. ſer. 7. 
                  Iniuriam facit martyri qui or at pro martyro: He doth wrong a Martyr, that prayes for a Martyr: nor the damned, whether they be in the loweſt Hell, as reprobates, or in Lymbo, as vnbaptized Infants: but onely the ſoules in Purgatory. And yet notwithſtanding, they both alledge the authorities of ancient Fathers, to prooue the prayer for the dead, who prayed for thoſe whom they aſſured themſelues to be in heauen: and alſo by their owne doctrine and practice declare, that they haue vſed to pray for the damned. As touching the Fathers, Nazianzene prayed for Ceſarius, and Ambroſe forNazian. in land. Ceſarii. Ambro. de obitu Theod & Valent. in Auguſt. confeſ. lib. 9. c. 13. 
                  Theodoſius, Valentinian and Saint Auguſtine for his mother. And in the ancient Leiturgies of the Church, prayers were made for Patriarks, Prophets, Martyrs, and the bleſſed Virgine Mary her ſelfe: yea, for the Popes alſo: as for Pope Leo for example; and yet they thought all theſe to be in the ſtate of bleſſedneſſe, as it appeareth in the ſame places where theſe prayers are expreſſed: and therefore Caſſander, theirCaſſand. conſult. art. 24. Bell. de Purgat. lib. 2. cap. 18. iudicious reconciler, calleth thoſe prayers, Teſtimonies of charitie towards the dead, congratulations of their preſent ioyes, and profeſſions of their faith and hope, concerning the immortality of their ſoules, and reſurrection of their bodies; not ſupplications for their releaſement out of Purgatory, as our Romaniſts imagine. Now hence thus we reaſon: If the Fathers prayed for them who were in poſſeſſion of bleſſednes, then their teſtimonies ſerue nothing for their purpoſe, who affirme, that ſoules in Purgatory are onely benefited by ſuch prayers: and if ſoules in Purgatory bee onely benefited by ſuch

prayers, as they ſay, then they deale impertinently and deceitfully to bring in the teſtimony of the Fathers for maintenance of ſuch prayers; in the one, bewraying the imbecillitie of their cauſe; in the other, the weakneſſe of their iudgements, and in both croſſing themſelues in that which they would build vp, as the builders of Babel did. Neyther doth this onely bewray their fraude in miſapplying the authorities of the Fathers: but alſo it implyeth a playne contradiction: for they teach, that though wee ought not to pray for the ſoules of the Saints that are in heauen, yet wee may pray for the reſurrection and glorification of their bodies, which notwithſtanding are not tormented in Purgatory, but aſleepe in their graues. And ſo it followeth, that by their doctrine we may not pray at all for the Saints departed, and yet wee may pray for their bodies, which are the one halfe of them. And againe, we may not pray for any that are dead, except they be in Purgatory; and yet we may pray for the bodies of the dead, that are not in Purgatory, but in their graues.
               54. If they reply as Bellarmine doth, that we may pray for28. Contrad. Bell. de Purgat. lib. 2. cap. 18. the Saints in Heauen, not for releaſ of any paine, but for increaſe of their glorie, either of their ſoules preſently, or of their bodies futurely at the Reſurrection: then (I ſay) they contradict themſelues againe. For, how doe the Praiers of the liuing doe no good to any, but thoſe that are in Purgatorie; whereas they are meanes to increaſe the glorie of their ſoules, and to procure the conſummation of their bodies glorie alſo? As for their practice in praying for the damned, Damaſcene reporteth, that Gregorie the Pope abſolued Traiane,
                  Damaſ. in or at. de defunct. and a Martyr Falcenilla from the paines of hell: and alſo relateth out of the hiſtorie of Palladius, that Saint Maehary demanded of the dead skull of an Idolater, whether the Praiers of the liuing did good vnto them in Hell or not to whom the skull ſhould anſwere, When thou offereſt vp Praiers for the dead, we in the meane time feele ſome refreſhing. The like wee read of Iudas, in the Legend of Saint Branden. Bellarmine indeed reiecteth this Tale of the skull as a Fable,Bell. Ibid. but yet he gain-ſaith not the deliuerie of Traiane, by the praiers

of Gregorie. But Antoninus, the Archbiſhop of Florence,
                  Antonin. part. 3. tit. 22. c. 5. §. 6. Aquia. in 4. diſt. 45. art. 2. q. 2. approoueth the firſt as an authenticall Storie, ſo doth Aquinas the laſt, and frameth this anſwere thereunto: that the ſoules of the damned receiue no mitigation of their paine by the Praiers of the liuing; but onely a certaine vaine and deceitfull ioy: and the Schoole men deuiſe ſtrange reaſons, how this ſhould be brought to paſſe, ſome ſaying that Traian, by the vertue of Gregories Praiers, returned to life, and did penance, and ſo obtained pardon, and glorie: others affirming that his ſoule was not ſimply abſolued from the guilt of puniſhment, but that his paine was ſuſpended vntill the day of Iudgement: others imagining, that his ſoule was not freed from Hell, but from the torments of Hell; ſo that he ſhould remaine there, but ſhould feele no paine: And laſtly, Bernardine reiecting all theſe opinions, and concluding that Traian was not definitiuely condemned, but conditionally, to wit, the diuine Wiſdome fore-ſeeing that Gregorie ſhould pray for him, and therefore to haue deferred his damnatorie ſentence. Thus they labour in by-paths that forſake the way of Truth, and wander they know not whither. But to the point, either that is falſe, that ſoules in Purgatorie are onely helped by the Praiers and Sacrifices of the liuing, or this, that by them the damned may be either releaſed or refreſhed.
               55. Laſtly, both the Doctrines of Purgatorie and Praier29. Contrad. for the dead, are directly croſſed by their Canon of the Maſſe: for there thoſe dead perſons for whom Praier is made, are ſaid to reſt in Chriſt, and to ſleepe the ſleepe of peace: and yet here they ſay, that none are to be praied and ſacrificed for, but thoſe onely that are in Purgatorie. What, is there then any reſt in Purgatorie? is to be tormented reſtleſſely in thoſe burning flames, which in their iudgement are equall for extremitie, and anguiſh (excepting onely continuance) to the paines of Hell, to be at reſt, and to ſleepe in peace? is Purgatorie become a Paradiſe? and the skirts of Hell the ſuburbes of Heauen? this is new & ſtrange Doctrine: and yet this muſt needes bee, if both their practice of praying for the dead in their Maſſe, and their doctrine of the ſame in their bookes bee true.
               
                  56. Concerning inuocation of Saints, it is intangled with30. Contrad. diuers abſurd contrarieties: for firſt if it bee true, which the former Doctrine requires, that wee muſt pray for the Saints which are in bliſſe, that their glorie may bee increaſed: thenBell. de Purgat. lib. 2. cap. 18. it is falſe that wee muſt pray vnto them. For if they ſtand in need of our Praiers, as they doe, if by them their glorie is increaſed, then they ſhould pray vnto vs, aſwell as wee vnto them: and if they ſtand in need of our helpe being in Heauen, how can they helpe vs being on Earth? if we be Mediatours for them, how are they Mediatours for vs? True it is, that here below one man prayeth for another, becauſe they ſtand in need of one another: but by another Doctrine which is alſo the truth, the Saints enioy the ſight and preſence ofIdem de Sanct. beat. lib. 1. cap. 2. God, and therefore are moſt bleſſed, for in him they enioy all ſinneſſe of ioy and glorie; ſo that nothing can bee added to that happineſſe, which in their ſoules they enioy: and therefore one of theſe two neceſſarily are falſe, either we muſt not pray vnto them, or we need not pray for them.
               57. Againe, they a leage teſtimonies out of the olde Teſtament,31. Contrad. to prooue the inuocation of Saints, as that Praier of Moſes, Remember, O Lord, Abraham, Iſaac, and Iacob, thy
                  Bell. Ibid. lib. 1. cap. 19. Ecchius Enchir. cap. 14. 15. Coſter. Enchir. cap. 14. 
                  ſeruants: and Ier. 25. If Moſes and Samuel ſtand before mee, my ſoule ſhould not bee to this people: and Gen. 48. 16. and Iob the 51. & 2. Machabees 15. with diuers others: and yet they teach, that before Chriſt, there was no Saint in Heauen, but all in Lymbo. Now, if they were in Lymbo, and could not help themſelues, vntil the Mediatour came, how could they help others? and if they did not enioy the preſence of God themſelues, how could they be certified thereby, as by a glaſſe, of the neceſſities and Praiers of the liuing? ſo that it muſt needes follow, that either the Saints were not praied vnto, or elſe if they were, then they were in Heauen, and not in Lymbo. Eſpecially, ſeeing Bellarmine confeſſeth, that the Saints in Lymbo
                  Bell. Ibid. lib. 1. cap. 20. did not ordinarily know the neceſſities of the liuing: that being a prerogatiue of perfect bleſſedneſſe: neyther tooke care of humane affaires, nor were protectors of the Church, as the Saints in Heauen are. Bellarmine indeede, ſeeing this abſurditie,

acknowledgeth, that for the reaſons afore alleaged, it was not a cuſtome in the olde Teſtament to direct their Praiers purpoſely to the Saints; but in their praiers to God, to alleage the merits of the Saints: but herein hee both croſſeth himſelfe, and all his fellowes: for if it be ſo, why doth he and they produce teſtimonies out of the olde Teſtament, to prooue their inuocation which is made directly vnto the Saints?
               58. Laſtly, they affirme that no Saints may bee worſhipped32. Contrad. publikely, that is, in the name of the Church, vnleſſe hee be canonized by the Pope, for the auoiding of miſpriſion:Bell. Ibid. c. 
                        •
                     . & 10. and yet they confeſſe that none were canonized till 800. yeeres after Chriſt, by Pope Leo the third, and alſo that it is lawfull priuately to worſhip any of whoſe ſanctity I haue an opinion: now I would gladly know, if this bee a way to auoide miſtaking, why was it forborne ſo long? or why is it not vrged priuately aſwell as publikely? if canonization were neceſſary 800. yeeres after Chriſt, to auoide miſtaking, then there was much miſtaking before, or elſe this remedy would not haue beene hatched: and if it was neceſſary in the publicke ſeruice, then is it much more in priuate deuotions, ſeeing priuate men are more propenſe to falſe ſuppoſitions, then a whole congregation is: and ſo this new doctrine of canonization, not onely condemneth the Idolatry offormer times, in the inuocation of Saints, but alſo openeth a wide doore to priuate ſuperſtition, in that kind: and ſo indeed croſſeth and vndermineth it ſelfe: for Bellarmine confeſſeth out of Sulpitius, that the people did long celebrate one for a martyr, who after
                  Bell. de Sanct. beat. lib. 1. cap. 7. 
                  appeared, and tolde them that hee was damned: and Alexander the third reprehendeth certaine men, for giuing the honour of a martyr, to one that dyed drunke: and no doubt but many ſuch Saints are in their Martyrologe at this day, notwithſtanding their canonization: ſo that by canonizing, they preuent miſtaking, & by giuing liberty to priuate inuocation, they giue occaſion, if not cauſe of miſtaking: then which, what can be more contradictory?
               59. Againe, when they barre all children that are vnbaptized,33. Contrad. out of Heauen, and confine them to Limbo, there to endure

the puniſhment of loſſe for euer: doe they not contradict another doctrine of theirs, which teacheth, that men dying without the baptiſme of water, if they haue baptiſmum flaminis, vel ſanguinis, that is, either ſuffer martyrdome for Chriſts ſake, or, bee regenerated by his Spirit, and ſo haue a deſire to bee initiated by that Sacrament, but are preuented by ſome meanes, may notwithſtanding goe to Heauen: for if want of baptiſme bee a ſufficient cauſe to keepe from Heauen, then it is ſo as well in men growne, as in infants: and if it bee not a ſufficient cauſe, to ſhut vp Heauen gates againſt men of yeeres, then how can it be to yong infants? eſpecially, ſeeing infants by their doctrine, are equall to men in two things: firſt, that they may bee martyrs, as well as they: as the children whom Herod ſlew in Bethl
                        •
                     em, are celebrated in their leiturgies: and ſecondly, that they may bee ſanctified as well as they, as Iohn Baptiſt was in his mothers wombe: and in theſe two are precedent vnto them, firſt, that they are void of actuall tranſgreſſions, with which, men of yeeres are infinitely ſtayned, and ſo neerer to Heauen, then thoſe: and ſecondly, though they haue no deſire of baptiſme in themſelues, yet they are deuoted thereunto, both by the deſire of their parents, and by the purpoſe and intent of the Church. And therefore, all conſiderations, being equall in the perſons, and the oddes remaining, if there be any on the infants ſide, it can bee no leſſe then a direct contradiction, that children vnbaptized cannot bee ſaued, and men vnbaptized may bee ſaued: for it implieth thus much in effect, that the outward baptiſme of water is neceſſary to ſaluation, and yet the outward baptiſme of water is not neceſſary to ſaluation.
               60. Againe, concupiſcence in the regenerate, is denyed34. Contrad. Bell. de amiſſ. grat. & ſtat. peccat. lib. 5. cap. 7. Concil. Trident. Seſſ. 5. by them all, to bee in it owne nature ſinne, and yet they all confeſſe, that it is malum, an euill, and vitium, a vice. Is any thing naturally euill, which is not ſinne? or a vice in Philoſophy, that is not a ſinne in diuinity? This is ſtrange diuinity. The name of euill, we know, is vſed of annoyances, croſſes, and afflictions; but theſe are naturall euils, and not morall: but to doe euill, can bee ſaid of nothing, but ſinne: and howſoeuer

ti bee true, that vice is rather the habit, then the act of ſinne: yet becauſe it is the habit, is it therefore leſſe ſinfull then the act? noy, is it not more ſinfull, ſeeing it groweth out of many actes, and is confirmed by cuſtome, and almoſt turned to nature? In this therefore they are moſt contrary to themſelues, when they grant concupiſcence to bee of it owne nature an euill, and a vice, and yet not a ſinne: for nothing is naturally euill, but that which ſwarueth from good: nor any thing vice, but that which is contrary to vertue. Now all morall good and vertue is within the compaſſe of the Law of God, and all morall euill and vice, a tranſgreſſion of that Law; therefore, it cannot but follow, that concupiſcence being a morall euill and vice, and therefore a tranſgreſſion of the Law of God, ſhould bee cleared from being ſinne, of it owne nature, eſpecially, ſeeing as Origen ſaith, This is the nature of
                  Orig. in Rom. 7. 
                  ſinne, if any thing bee done, which the Law forbiddeth: and Bede,

                  that all that ſwarueth from the rule of righteouſneſſe, & ſinne: and Caeſarius Gregory, Naianzens brother, that ſinne is euery aſſay to reſiſt, and euery reſiſtance it ſelfe againſt vertue. And Saint Auguſtine, that therefore a thing is ſinne, becauſe it ought not to

                  bee done, and that to doe any thing amiſſe, is to ſinne: but euery moral leuill and vice is forbidden by the Law, ſwarueth from the rule of righteouſneſſe, is a reſiſtance againſt vertue, and a thing that is done amiſſe, and ought not to bee done: therefore is alſo ſinne in it owne nature. They haue no wayes to helpe themſelues out of theſe briers, but by the diſtinction of properly and improperly, which they ſay, they fetch out of Saint Auguſtine, as if concupiſcence in the regenerat ſhould be ſinne improperly, and not properly, by which the contradiction is not taken away: for they ſay, that it is not ſinne at all in it owne nature, but onely euill: now; if it bee improperly ſinne of it owne nature, then it is ſome way ſinne: and ſo that propoſition is falſe, that it is not ſinne at all: and beſides therefore it is ſaid by that diſtinction in Saint Auguſtine, to be improperly ſinne, becauſe it is not come to ſo high a perfection, as other ſinnes are, by being without conſent of will: neuertheleſſe, hee neuer meant, but that it was a tranſgreſſion of

the Law of God: and ſo a ſinne in it owne nature: as may appeare by almoſt infinite places, in his bookes: as for inſtance one for all, Concupiſcence (ſaith he) is not onely the puniſhment
                  Aug. contra Julian. lib. 5. c. 3. 
                  of ſinne, and cauſe of ſinne, but euen ſinne it ſelfe, becauſe there is in it a rebellion againſt the Law of the minde: and therefore hee

Therefore Saint Auguſtine, when he called it 
                     •
                  in improperly, neuer dreamt that is was not a tranſgreſſion of the Law, but either that it was not ſo high a degree of ſinne, as thoſe which are done with conſent of will: or that becauſe the guilt of it is taken away by baptiſme in the regenerate; as hee ſpeaketh in another place, ConcupiſcenceIdem contra Iulian. lib. 2. is not called ſinne in ſuch manner, as ſinne maketh guilty, becauſe the guilt thereof is releaſed in the Sacrament of regeneration. And thus this diſtinction rightly vnderſtood, ſtandeth them in no ſtead, to keepe their doctrine from manifeſt contradiction.
               61. This ſubiect might bee proſecuted in many more35. Contrad. points of their Religion, but I conclude with theſe two, Antichriſt, and the Biſhop of Rome, which I ioyne together in this diſcourſe, becauſe in truth they are all one: and though they differ in name, yet they agree in nature: one egge is not liker to another, nor milke liker to milke, then the Pope is to Antichriſt. As touching Antichriſt therefore thus they confeſſe, that by myſticall Babylon in the Reuelation, is meant `Rome,

the mother of all fornications, that is, of Superſtition and Idolatry, of all Atheiſme and hereſie: and ſeeing ſhee maketh drunke the kings and inhabitants of the earth, with the golden cup of her fornication, and is died red, and made drunke with the bloud of the Saints, and of the martyrs of Ieſus: And laſtly, ſeeing Antichriſt muſt bee one of the ſeuen heads, to wit, the laſt of the Romane beaſt, and the laſt King of the Romane Empire, though not called the Romane Emperour, asBell. de Rom. Pontif. l. 3. c. 15. 
                  Bellarmine himſelfe confeſſeth. All theſe things conſidered, and laide together, it muſt needs bee inferred by neceſſary conſequence, that the whore of Babylon cannot chooſe but bee the ſeat of Antichriſt; and if it bee ſo, then either Ieruſalem is not the ſeat, where this man of ſinne muſt raigne; or by Babylon is not meant Rome, but Ieruſalem: let them chooſe which: one of theſe is apparantly falſe.
               62. Againe, when by Babylon they vnderſtand Rome, they36. Contrad. reſtraine it to heatheniſh Rome, vnder the perſecuting Emperours; and ſay, that it is not meant of Rome Catholicke and Chriſtian, but of Rome Ethnick and Heatheniſh. Now if Rome be Babylon, and Babylon the ſeat of Antichriſt, as hath beeneBell. de Rom. Pontif. l. 3. c. 13. proued out of their owne confeſſion, how can Rome heatheniſh, vnder the Emperours, be it, when as they all agree, that Antichriſt ſhall not come, vntill a little before the end of the world? That ſtate of Rome, which they ſpeake of, is paſt aboue a thouſand yeeres ſince, and Antichriſt is not yet come according to their doctrine. Neceſſarily therefore it followeth, that either Antichriſt ſate there then, and ſo is come long agoe; or elſe that Rome was not Babylon, whilſt it was vnder the heathen Emperours, but is, or ſhall be after it hath receiued the Chriſtian faith.
               63. Againe, the Romane Empire muſt bee remoued before37. Contrad. the comming of this great enemie: this, all our aduerſariesIdem l. 3. cap. 5. yeeld vnto: and moſt of the ancient fathers ſo interpret that place, When he that hindereth, ſhall be taken out of the

is both vtterly aboliſhed before the raigne of Antichriſt, and yet is not aboliſhed at all.
               63. Againe, they teach, that Enoch and Eli

Pontif. l. c. 6. & cap. 12. and preach againſt Antichriſt, and at length conuert the Iewes: and yet they alſo affirme, that the Iewes ſhall receiue Antichriſt for their Meſſias. If the Iewes ſhall receiue him for their Meſſias, how ſhall they bee conuerted by Enoch and Elias to the true Meſſias? And if they ſhall be conuerted, how doe they receiue him for their Meſsias? If they ſhall be conuerted before Antichriſts comming, and then fall away from Chriſt; then this could not be done by Enoch and Elias, who, by their doctrine, muſt come in Antichriſts time: and yet it ſeemeth by them, they muſt be called before; becauſe Bellarmine confeſſeth, that Antichriſt muſt be an Apoſtate, and the head of the Apoſtacy: but the Iewes cannot make an Apoſtacie before they be called. Againe, if they ſhall bee conuerted in Antichriſts time, how ſhall Antichriſt raigne three yeeres and an halfe, when all his Subiects ſhall be taken from him? And laſtly, if they ſhall bee called after the deſtruction of Antichriſt, as indeed they ſuppoſe, thē how can that be, ſeeingIbid. cap. 9. the deſtruction of Antichriſt ſhal not be but immediately before the end of the world, euen fiue and fortie daies, and no more? Shall a whole Nation bee conuerted in ſo ſhort a time, and being conuerted, continue no longer, to make profeſſion and practice of their conuerſion? Thus one abſurditie being granted, a thouſand follow.
               64. Beſides, they ſay, that Antichriſt ſhall bee borne of the

                     •
                  p, they are driuen to ſay, that indeed he ſhall truly riſe out of the Tribe of Dan, but ſhal faine himſelfe to be of the Tribe of Iudah, and of the familie of Dauid. As if the Iewes were ſo credulous to beleeue his report without proofe: or that they kept ſo ſleight an account of their Genealogies, in which neuer any people were more ſcrupulous: or, as if a diſtinctiō of

their Tribes remained to this day, their Genealogies being defaced ſo long ſince by Herod: and themſelues ſcattered through all Countries of the world. Either therefore he muſt be of the Tribe of Iuda, in truth, more then by a counterfeit ſimulation; or elſe the Iewes will neuer receiue him.
               65. Laſtly, they teach, that Ieruſalem is to bee the ſeat of40. Contrad. Antichriſt, and the Iewes his peculiar Subiects: and yet they alſo confeſſe, that hee ſhall bee the laſt Emperour of Rome, though not called by that name; and therefore that the Romanes ſhall bee his Subiects. From whence I thus conclude; that if the Romane Empire bee the Dominion of Antichriſt, then it is not likely that hee ſhould bee the expected Meſsias of the Iewes, nor that Ieruſalem ſhould be his ſeat: for neuer any Romane Emperour kept his Imperiall reſidence in that Citie: and if the Iewes bee his Subiects, and Ieruſalem the ſeat of his Kingdome, then it cannot bee that hee ſhould be the laſt Emperour of Rome.
               
               66. And thus much of Antichriſt in generall. Now of the41. Contrad. Biſhop of Rome in particular; who, if he be not, as we conſtantly beleeue, this very Antichriſt; yet, (as Gregory their owne Pope confeſſeth) is his fore-runner, becauſe hee claimeth to himſelfe the title of Vniuerſall Biſhop. Concerning the Pope, their preſumption is, that hee cannot erre in any caſe, in thoſe things which pertaine to faith, nor yet which concerne manners, when he teacheth iudicially, and ſpeaketh out of his Chaire: and yet they doe not deny, but that hee may bee an Heretike.

ſome cauſes as a priuate man. And it is a Decree of their owne, that the Pope may bee found negligent of his owne and his brethrens ſaluation, and draw innumerable peopleD. 4.

This groſſe and manifeſt contradiction they labour to couer by a ſilly and ridiculous diſtinction: for thus they creepe betwixt the barke and the tree: The Pope may erre as hee is Man, but not as he is a Pope. Orthus, He may erre in his priuate opinions, but not è Cathedra, by way of definition. Or thus, Hee may erre when hee inſtructeth a particular Church: but he cannot when he purpoſeth to direct the Vniuerſail Church. Or thus, Hee may erre in the premiſes, but not in the concluſion. But this is a ſenſeleſſe and ridiculous ſhift. For firſt, if hee may write, teach, and preach, and decree hereſie, as out of Occham and Bozius: and erre in his Diſpenſations, as out of Victoria, then he may erre iudicially, and è Cathedra; for theſe are iudiciall exerciſes of the Chaire. Secondly, if the Pope may be an Heretike, as he is a Man, and haue a ſound ſaith, as he is a Pope; then as hee is a Man, hee may goe to hell, and as he is a Pope, to heauen: but both mu

the ſame caſe, that is, neither to erre perſonally nor iudicially: or if he erre one way, then alſo to bee ſubiect to error the other.

               67. Another doctrine of theirs is, that the Pope is the42.

If they ſay, that wee giue vnto a King the ſame title of head and gouernor of the Church, who notwithſtanding is often a tyrant, and waſter of the Church, and a very reprobate: I anſwere, that in attributing theſe titles of dignity to Kings, wee doe not poſitiuely ſet downe what euery one is: for if hee bee a deſtroyer of the Church, hee is not an vpholder of it; but what euery one ought to bee in regard of his office: but the Romaniſts abſolutely ſet it downe, that

though the Pope be a wolfe, waſting the flocke of Chriſt, and though hee lead by his doctrine and example, infinite ſoules with him to hell, yet hee is ſtill actually the head of the Church, quatenus Papa, and no man may ſay vnto him, Why doe you ſo?
               68. Againe, it was decreed by two Councils, and thoſe43. Contrad. aſſembled, authorized, and confirmed by Popes themſelues, that the Councill was aboue the Pope; and yet the CouncillConcil. Conſtant. & Baſill. Bell. de Concil. lib. 2. cap. 17. of Laterane, vnder Pope Leo the tenth, decreeth peremptorily, that the Pope is aboue all Councils: & ſo alſo moſt of the moderne Romaniſts affirme. Now if the decrees of Councils lawfully aſſembled, and approoued by Popes, bee the doctrines of the Church, then here is one doctrine quite contrary to another, one Councill oppoſite to another, yea, one Pope to another: which is no new nor ſtrange thing, but ordinary in the Church of Rome. As witneſſe, Pope Iohn the two and twentieth, and Pope Nicholas, about the queſtion of our Sauiours manner of poſſeſſing earthly goods: and Pope Celeſtine, and Pope Innocent the third, in the queſtion of diuorce, in the caſe of hereſie: and Pope Pelagius, and Pope Gregory the firſt, in the queſtion of putting away the wiues of Subdeacons; one of theſe croſſing the other iudicially, and one gain ſaying, what the other defended.

Contrad. not Antichriſt; and yet they affirme that hee is the Vicar of Chriſt heere on earth: a flat contradiction: for the word Antichriſt ſignifieth not onely an enemie vnto Chriſt, but alſo one that taketh vpon him the office and authority of Chriſt:

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , affording naturally, and properly, both ſignifications, as appeareth in theſe two wordes 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                  , a Proconſull: in the firſt whereof it ſignifieth oppoſition, and the ſecond ſubſtitution. Now then, if the Pope bee Chriſts Vicar generall on earth, then he is in the laſt ſenſe Antichriſt: and beeing ſo in the laſt ſenſe, it is moſt likely that hee is alſo the ſame in the firſt: becauſe the Antichriſt ſpoken of in the Scripture, is deſcribed to be ſuch a one as is not an open and outward, but a couert and diſguiſed enemie, hauing two hornes like the Lambe, that is, counterfeting the humility and meekneſſe of Chriſt, and making aApoc. 13. & 17. glorious profeſſion of religion, with a ſhew of counterfeit holineſſe, when notwithſtanding hee ſpeaketh lyes in hypocriſie, and vttereth wordes like the dragon, and is the greateſt enemy to Chriſt Ieſus and his Goſpel that euer was: ſo that in that hee is Chriſts Vicar, hee is Antichriſt, by their owne confeſſion, in that ſenſe, and being ſo, is probably Antichriſt alſo in the other: becauſe the true Antichriſt muſt bee both the one and the other. And ſo for the concluſion of this point, wee haue not onely the myſtery of iniquity, that is, Antichriſtianiſme in the manifold contradictions and oppoſitions thereof, but euen Antichriſt himſelfe lurking in his den, profeſſing himſelfe and his followers to bee the onely true Church of God, and pretending himſelfe to be the Prince of the couenant, as Saint Ierome ſpeaketh, that is aſmuch as to ſay, the Vicar of Chriſt: and without doubt, as the ſweet harmonie in Chriſtian Religion, and euery part thereof with it ſelfe, is a pregnant argument of the infallible truth thereof: ſo the miſerable oppoſition and contrariety in the Religion of the Church of Rome, and that moſt of the doctrines therein contained, either with themſelues, or with other, as I haue in part here ſhewed, leauing a fuller demonſtration thereof to ſome other that ſhal more deeply ſearch into them, doe euidently euince, that it is the Religion of Antichriſt; and therefore not onely to be ſuſpected, but euen to bee abhorred of all them that loue the truth, or that deſire the ſaluation of their ſoules.
            
            
               
               
                  The IX. MOTIVE. That Religion, whoſe doctrines are in many points apparently oppoſite to the word of God and the doctrine of the Goſpell cannot bee the trueth: but ſuch is the Religion of the Church of Rome, ergo &c.
               1 IN the Chapter going before, I haue ſhewed how the Romiſh Religion is contrary to it ſelfe, that is, falſhood to falſhood: now in this, my taske is to demonſtrate, how it croſſeth the word of God, that is, falſhood to truth; which being proued, I hope, no man which is not drunke with the poiſonous cuppe of the whoore of Babylons fornication, will doubt of the vanity and falſhood thereof. Now my purpoſe is not to enter into the liſts of diſputation, and confute their opinions by ſtrength of argument, (that combate hath beene valiantly performed by many of our Champions:) onely my intent is, firſt to ſhew how their doctrines cōtradict the plain text of Gods word, and ſecondly, to wipe away their ſubtle and intricate diſtinctions, whereby they labour to make a reconciliation betwixt the word of God, and their opinions; which ſhall be my onely taske in this Chapter: for it is to bee noted, that there was neuer any generation ſo happie, or rather ſo miſerable in diſtinctions, as the Romaniſts are: they maintain their kingdomes by diſtinctions, by them they blind the eyes of the ſimple, dazle the vnderſtanding of the vnaduiſed, ſet a gloſe vpon their counterfeit ware, couer the deformity of their Apoſtate Church; and laſtly, extinguiſh the truth, or at leaſtwiſe, ſo darken and obſcure it, that it cannot ſhine ſo brightly as it would: but in ſeeking to extinguiſh the light of truth, they diſtinguiſh themſelues from the trueth: and as Iacob by his party-coloured ſtickes, occaſioned a brood of party-coloured ſheepe and goates: ſo they, by their fond diſtinctions, bring foorth a party-coloured and counterfeit Religion: as I truſt to lay open to the world, in this diſcourſe following.

I paſſe ouer in ſilence, and come to the minor or ſecondMinor. propoſition, which is, that the Religion of the Church of Rome in many doctrines is apparently oppoſite to the word of God.

But theſe diſtinctions cannot extinguiſh the truth: for firſt they giue by name the higheſt worſhip that can bee, to wit, Latria, to the Image and reliques of Chriſt and the croſſe, and to a piece of bread in the Sacrament, inſomuch that Gregory de Valentia, a famous Ieſuite, and Bellarmines compeere, is in this regard driuen to ſay, that ſome kinde of Idolatrie is lawfull. Secondly, if they ſhould deny this, yet their doctrine and practice doth apparently proclaime aſmuch: for when they ſay to their Agnus deis, It breaketh and quaſheth all ſinne as Chriſts bloud, doe they not equall them to Chriſt? when they place their hope and confidence in Saints and reliques, doe they not equall them to God? when they pray, that by the merit of a golden, ſiluer, or woodden croſſe, they may be freed from ſinne committed, doe they not equall it with our Sauiour that dyed on the croſſe? when they deſire at the Saints hands grace and glory, doe they not equall them to the God of grace, and glory? when they call the bleſſed Virgine the Queene of Heauen, and giue vnto her one halfe of Gods kingdome, euen the halfe of mercy, doe they not equall her

to her maker? Laſtly, when they offer ſacrifice to reliques andMiſſal. Rom. tit. derit. ſeruand. in celebr. miſſ.

               7. Bellarmine anſwereth, that their doctrine is falſely charged, to ſay that ſinners are iuſtified, partly for their owne works ſake, and partly by Chriſt: for (ſaith hee) by a diſtinction there bee three kinde of works; one, of thoſe that are performed by the ſtrength of nature onely, without faith and the grace of God: another, of ſuch as proceede from faith and grace, but not from a man fully iuſtified: and therefore are called works of Preparation; as Prayer, Almes, Faſting, Sorrow for ſinne, and ſuch like: and the third, of ſuch which are done by a man iuſtified, and proceede from the Spirit of God dwelling in his heart, and ſheading abroad charity in the ſame. Now concerning the firſt, hee acknowledgeth that we are not iuſtified by them, by the example of Abraham, Rom. 4. and therefore that they moſt impudently belye their doctrine, that faſten this opinion vpon them. As touching the ſecond, he ſaith, that theſe works Preparatiue are not meritorious of reconciliation and iuſtification by condignity and iuſtice: yet in as much as they proceede from faith and grace, they merite after a ſort; that is, obtaine remiſſion of ſinnes. The third ſort of works hee boldly and confidently affirmeth, to merite not remiſſion of ſinnes, becauſe that was obtayned before: but euerlaſting glory and happineſſe, and that truely and properly.
               
                  8. This Bellarminian diſtinction may be diſtinguiſhed byAnſwere. two eſſentiall qualities: firſt, Folly; ſecondly, Falſehood. Folly: for it maketh nothing to the taking away of the Antitheſis before mentioned: for when as he confeſſeth, that the ſecond kinde of works doe merite remiſſion of ſinnes after a ſort, and the third eternall life abſolutely, what doth 
                     •
                  e but acknowledge that which wee charge them withall, and which himſelfe reiected a little before as a ſlaunder? namely, that wee are iuſtified and ſaued partly by our owne merits, and partly by the merits of Chriſt: for the Goſpell ſaith, We are ſaued by Chriſts merits alone: and he ſaith, We are ſaued by our owne merits alſo. And thus the folly and vanity of his diſtinction euidently appeareth.
               9. The falſehood ſheweth it ſelfe in two things: firſt, in that hee affirmeth, that they doe not teach, that works done before grace doe merite any thing at Gods hand: for though it be a Canon of the Councill of Trent, charged with an Anathema,Concil. Trident. 
                        •
                     eſſ. 6. can. 1. 
                  If any man ſhould ſay, that a man may bee iuſtified by his owne works, wrought by the power of nature, without the diuine helpe by Chriſt Ieſus: and Bellarmine ſeemeth to affirme as much in this place. Yet Andradius, that famous Interpreter of that forenamed Councill, one of the moſt learned men of his age, and that knew well the myſteries of that Councill, doth tell vs, that by diuine helpe the Councill vnderſtood not the grace of regeneration, and ſpeciall worke of Gods ſanctifying Spirit, but heroicall motions, ſtirred vp in the vnregenerate and vnbeleeuers: and that by this ſpeciall helpe they might doe works void of all fault, and meritorious of ſaluation. And Bellarmine confeſſeth in other places,Bell. de Iuſtif. lib. 4. cap. 20. Salmer. t
                        ••
                     . 5. pag. 41. Concil Trid. Seſſ 6. can. 7. that they are good, ſuogenere: that is, morally: and Salmeron the Ieſuite, that they diſpoſe and prepare a man for iuſtification: and the ſame Councill of Trent in the ſeuenth Canon following, doth curſe them that ſhall ſay they are ſinnes, or that they deſerue the hatred of God. Now if theſe kinde of works be good in their kinde, and preparatiues to iuſtification, and not ſinnes, nor deſeruing the hatred of God, but ſuch as whereby the Heathen were ſaued; then it is a probable

falſehood in Bellarmine, when he ſaith by their doctrine, that theſe works doe not iuſtifie, nor helpe any thing to the iuſtification of a ſinner.
               10. Secondly, it is falſe alſo which he affirmeth, concerning the ſecond kinde of works: to wit, of preparation, that though they proceede from faith and grace, yet they doe not iuſtifie: for Bellarmine in another place doth not ſtick toBell. de Iuſtif. lib. 1. cap. 13. Idem. cap. 17. ſay, that this faith iuſtifieth by way of merite, and deſerueth forgiuenes of ſinnes after a certaine manner: and here in this place, that theſe works proceeding from faith, doe merite after their manner, and obtaine remiſſion of ſinnes; which if it be true, then it muſt needes be falſe which he ſayd before, That they make not our works to concurre with the merits of Chriſt, for the remiſſion of ſinnes, which is the point of oppoſition: and that which alſo he affirmeth here, That theſe works doe not iuſtifie, ſeeing remiſſion of ſinnes is of the verie eſſence of iuſtification: for none haue their ſinnes forgiuen, but they are iuſtified; and none are iuſtified, but they haue their ſinnes forgiuen: they concurre in one, if they bee not one and the ſame: And therefore if theſe works merite remiſſion of ſinnes, they muſt needs alſo merite iuſtification. And thus Bellarmines diſtinction doth no waies free their doctrine from oppoſition to the doctrine of the Goſpell.
               11. The Goſpell teacheth, that hee which repenteth and3. Mark. 1. 15. Epheſ. 3. 12. Heb. 4. 16. Heb. 10. 19, 22. Mat. 9. 3. Mat. 9. 22. Ioh. 16. 33. Rom. 8. 15. 1. Ioh. 3. 14.

But the Church of Rome teacheth, that a man muſt alwaies doubt of the remiſſion of his ſins, and neuer be aſſured thereof; which doubting (as Chytraeus truely ſpeaketh) is plainely repugnant to the nature of faith, and a meere heatheniſh doctrine.
               12. Bellarmine anſwereth here not by a diſtinction, but by a negation, denying flatly that the Scripture teacheth any ſuch doctrine, that a man may be aſſured of the remiſſion of his ſinnes, and his reconciliation with God: and this hee ſeemeth

to prooue by two arguments; one, becauſe it is contraryEccleſ. 9. to other plaine and manifeſt places of Scripture: another, becauſe all Gods promiſes almoſt haue a condition annexed vnto them, which no man can iuſtly know whether hee hath fulfilled or no.
               13. It is good for Bellarmine here to vſe a plaine negation:Anſwere. for their doctrine is ſo manifeſt, that it will admit no diſtinction: the Councill of Trent hath put that out of all queſtionConcil. Trident. Seſſ. 6. cap. 9. and diſtinction. For it teacheth in expreſſe words, that no man ought to perſwade and aſſure himſelfe of the remiſsion of his ſinnes, and of his iuſtification; no though he be truly iuſtified, and his ſinnes be truely and really pardoned. This doctrine is ſo euident, that Bellarmine could neither diſtinguiſh, as his cuſtome is, nor yet deny it; and therefore hee freely confeſſeth it: and yet Gropper condemned it as an impious doctrine:Gropper. Catharin. aſſert. & Apolog. Domin. Sot

                     . Apol. cap. 2. and Catharinus, at the Councill of Trent, defended the contrary, that the childe of God, by the certainty of faith, knoweth himſelfe to be in the ſtate of grace. And ſo did alſo Dominicus a Sot
                        •
                     , and diuers others of their owne ſtampe But there is great cauſe why the Church of Rome ſhould maintaine this doctrine of doubting very peremptorily: for as Chemnitius
                  Chemnit. exam. pars 1. pag. 183. well obſerueth, all the Market of Romiſh ſuperſtitious wares is built vpon this foundation: for when as the conſcience, being taught to doubt of ſolution, doth ſeeke for ſome true and ſound comfort, and not finding the ſame in faith, through the merits of Chriſt, then it flyeth to it owne works, and heapeth vp together a bundle of ſuperſtitious obſeruations, by which it hopeth to obtaine fauour at Gods hands: hence ariſe voluntary vowes, Pilgrimages, Inuocations of Saints, works of Supererogation, priuate Maſſes, ſale of Pardons, and a number ſuch like traſh: and when as yet they could not finde any ſound comfort in any of theſe, at laſt was Purgatory found out, and redemption of the ſoules of the dead out of that place of torment, by the ſuffrages and prayers of the liuing. Now the Romaniſts, fearing leſt theſe profitable and gainefull wares, whereby an infinite tribute is brought into their coffers, ſhould be bereft them, haue barred

out of their Church this doctrine of certainty of ſaluation by faith, of which if mens conſciences bee once perſwaded, they will neuer repoſe any more confidence in thoſe ſuperſtitious trumperies.
               14. But we, with Luther, may boldly ſay, that ſo odiousLuther in Gen. cap. 41. and impious is this doctrine, that if there were no other error in the Romane Church but this, we had iuſt cauſe of ſeparation from them: and with Chytraeus, that it is repugnant to the nature of faith, and a meere heatheniſh doctrine. For it doth not onely nouriſh mens infirmities, who are too much pro
                     •
                  e to doubting, but euen encourage them thereunto, and teach that we ought to doubt. But that we may come to the point, is not this indeede the doctrine of the Goſpell, that wee ſhould not doubt of our ſaluation? why then doth our Sauiour command all to repent, and beleeue the Goſpell? ByMat. 1. 15. which he plainely teacheth, where true repentance goeth before, there beleefe in the Goſpell, that is, aſſurance of forgiueneſſe of ſinnes by the bloud of Chriſt, doth follow: and that wee ought euery one to be thus aſſured, ſeeing this is a precept Euangelicall, which doth not onely giue charge of doing the thing commanded, as the Law doth; but alſo inſpireth grace and power to effect it: as Saint Auguſtine wellAug. de Spiritis & liter. informeth vs, when he ſaith, The Law was giuen, that grace might bee ſought; and grace was giuen, that the Law might bee fulfilled. Why doeth Saint Paul ſay, that the Spirit of GodRom. 8. 15. witneſſeth vnto our ſpirits that wee are the ſonnes of God? Neither is this witneſſe of the Spirit a doubtfull and vncertaine certificate: for Saint Paul, in the words going before, calleth it, the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father, and not the ſpirit of bondage, to feare any more. When therefore God doth ſhead abroad his Spirit into our hearts, crying, and making vs to cry, Abba, Father, in faithfull, not formall prayer, that is a certaine teſtimony to our ſpirits, that we are the ſonnes of God. For as Saint Ierome
                  Hierom. in Gal. cap. 4. well noteth, Wee neuer durſt call God, our Father, but vpon conſcience of the Spirit dwelling in vs. Neither doe we euer vpon this ground call God, our Father, but withall

we are, or ought to be perſwaded that we are his children.
               15. Againe, why doth hee ſay in another place, that all they which beleeue the Goſpell, are ſealed with the holy Spirit of promiſe? Are Gods children ſealed? and can they notEpheſ. 1. 13. ſee nor know the Seale? Is not this one vſe of a ſeale, to confirme a couenant, aſſuring the certainty of the performance thereof to him to whom it is made? Yea, doth not Saint Iohn ſay, Hereby we know that we dwell in him, and he in vs; becauſe
                  Ioh. 4. 13. 
                  he hath giuen vs of his Spirit? And againe, doth not the holy Ghoſt ſo aſcribe this knowledge of iuſtification and ſaluation on to a mans ſelfe, that he denyeth it to all others? To him that ouercommeth, I will giue a white ſtone, and in the ſtone a new

This no man knoweth, but he that hath it; therefore he that hath it, knoweth it. What can be more plaine? And yet this is the expoſition almoſt of all Diuines vpon that place. To omit all other teſtimonies, doth not the Scripture now teach this doctrine, touching the certainty of ſaluation?
               16. I but, ſaith Bellarmine, all Gods promiſes, for the moſt part, are conditionall, and no man can certainely know whether he hath performed the condition; and therefore cannot aſſure himſelfe of the promiſe. To which I anſwere, that albeit, in regard of our infirmitie, we are not able to fulfill the conditions required in Gods promiſes: yet wee are aſſured that we ſhall fulfill them, through him that ſtrengthneth vs: and ſo, as the Apoſtle Paul ſaid in one place, Wee can doe nothing, no, not ſo much as thinke a good thought. Yet in another2. Cor. 3. 5. place he ſaith, I can doe all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthneth me. So may we ſay of our ſelues, We cannot doPhil. 4. 13. anything of our ſelues: yet in Chriſt Ieſus wee can doe all things: By his might wee can keepe his Commandements; though not perfectly, yet ſo, as our defects are made vp by his perfection, and our endeuours accepted in his mediation: for his ſake it is giuen vnto vs, not onely to beleeue in him, but alſo to ſuffer for him: and by his neuer-faylingPhil. 1. 29.
                  
grace, and euerlaſting loue, we are aſſured that we ſhall perſeuere vnto the end. And therefore Origen ſaith, that it is
                  
                     Phil. 1. 6. Orig. in Ierem. hom. 1. 
                  impoſsible that that which God hath once quickned ſhould either by himſelfe or any other be killed. Thus there is no condition required of the children of God; but they are aſſured that they can performe it, though not in full meaſure, and by their owne ſtrength, yet in that meaſure which God will accept, and by the ſtrength of his Spirit which dwelleth in them, and ſanctifieth them to doe his will. And thus this third Antitheſis is nothing empeached by Bellarmines cauill.
               17. The Goſpell telleth vs, that there is but one onely propitiatory4 Heb. 9. 25. 28. Heb. 10. 12. 14. Sacrifice in the world, which is Chriſt Ieſus the Sauiour of the world, who offered vp himſelfe once, and no more, for to take away the ſinnes of his people. But the
                     Concil. Trident. Seſſ. 6. cap. 2. can. 1. 2. 3. 4. Church of Rome teacheth, that euery Maſſe is a propitiatory Sacrifice for the quicke and the dead: and that euery Prieſt, as often as he ſaith Maſſe, doth offer vp Chriſt vnto God the Father, as a Sacrifice for ſinne.
               18. Bellarmine here diſtinguiſheth againe, and ſaith, thatBell. de Rom. Pontif. l. 3. 6. 23. indeede there is but one onely propitiatory Sacrifice in the world, to wit, that which was once offered vpon the Croſſe; but yet that one Sacrifice may be reiterated in myſterie by the ſame high Prieſt Chriſt Ieſus, by the hands of a carnall Prieſt. And againe, he in another place diſtinguiſheth this SacrificeIdem. de miſſa. lib. 1. cap. 25. into bloudy & vnbloudy, & ſaith, that there was but one bloudie Sacrifice of Chriſt, and that on the Altar of the Croſſe: but there are many vnbloudy ſacrifices of the ſame Chriſt in their dayly Maſſes. And laſtly, that the ſacrifice of the Maſſe is but an application of the Sacrifice of the Croſſe vnto mens ſoules, for the actuall remiſſion of ſinnes purchaſed by Chriſt vpon the Croſſe.
               19. Here is much adoe to little purpoſe, three diſtinctions,Anſwere. and all not worth a ruſh: for all of them are mutually contrary to each others, and vaine, and friuolous in themſelues: firſt, if the ſacrifice of the Maſſe bee a repetition of the ſacrifice of the croſſe, then it is not an application of it: for it is one thing to reiterate, and another to apply: and therefore if the Prieſt

doth reiterate it, then hee doth not apply it: and if hee doth apply it, then hee doth not reiterate: for to reiterate, is to doe againe that which was done before, and to apply, is to make vſe of that which was done, but not to doe it againe. Beſide, if the maſſe bee a repetition, and application of the ſacrifice of the croſſe, then how is it an vnbloudy ſacrifice? can that bloudy ſacrifice bee repeated and applied after an vnbloudy manner? that is aſmuch as to ſay, it is a ſacrifice, and yet not a ſacrifice, eſpecially no propitiatory ſacrifice: ſeeing as the ApoſtleHeb. 10. ſpeaketh, without the ſhedding of bloud, there is no remiſſiō of ſinnes. Againe, if the maſſe be a repetition of that bloudy ſacrifice of Chriſt on the croſſe, then it is a repetition of Chriſts death, and a crucifying of him againe; for the ſacrifice of Chriſt, and the death of Chriſt is all one: and if it bee ſo, then it muſt needs be bloudy aſwell as that: for the repetition of a thing, is the doing of the ſame thing againe. And laſtly, if it bee an application of it, then it cannot bee a repetition of it: nor indeed the ſame in ſpecie with it; for the application of a thing, is not the thing it ſelfe in any reaſon: and thus theſe diſtinctions are at ciuill warre with each other: and indeed like deadly enemies doe cut each others throats.
               20. But let one of their own learned maſters, Peter Lumbard,

                     ſt. 12. conclude this point for vs; who ſaith that Chriſt dying vpon the croſſe, offered himſelfe, & is ſacrificed dayly in the Sacrament, becauſe in this Sacrament there is a cōmemoration of that ſacrifice of the croſſe which was once offered: this he ſpake, conuicted by the truth. And the Councill of Trent alſo in another place
                     Concil. Trident. 
                           •
                        eſſ. 22. v. cap. 1. doth almoſt, if not fully ſpeake aſmuch, when it ſayth, that Ieſus Chriſt left to his Church a ſacrifice, by which that bloudy ſacrifice which hee made vpon the croſſe, might bee repreſented, and the memory thereof continued: which if it be true, then being conuicted by their owne conſciences, and confeſſions, it remaines, that that doctrine which holdeth that the maſſe is a true, reall, propitiatory ſacrifice, is oppoſite to the doctrine of the Goſpell, which teacheth the contrary: and ſo this fourth Antitheſis is ſafe and ſound, for all that Bellarmine can ſay againſt it.
               
                  21. The Goſpell teacheth, that both parts of the Sacrament are to bee miniſtred to all Chriſtians; and of the cup it ſayth expreſly, Drinke ye all of this: but the Church of Rome hath decreed, that none ſhould drinke of the cup, but theConcil. Trident. Seſſ. 5. cap. 1. & 3. Clergie, and that the people ſhould content themſelues with the other part of the Sacrament.
               22. Bellarmine diſtinguiſheth of the word (All) and ſaith,Bell. de Rom. Pontif. l. 3. c. 23. By it is not to be vnderſtood all the faithfull, but the Apoſtles onely; which hee prooueth by Saint Marke, who ſayth, that they dranke all of it, that is, all the Apoſtles which ſate at table with our Sauiour Chriſt, and not all the Chriſtians that beleeued in him.

I anſwere, that this is Bellarmines conceit, or rather deceit; and hee borrowed it of Andradius the famous expoſiter of the Councill of Trent: but it is a miſerable gloſſe (woe bee to it) that ſo ſoully corrupts the text: firſt, the fathers vnderſtood by the vniuerſall All, all the faithfull; and that the Apoſtles heere in this great action, were not Paſtors, but ſheep, Chriſt himſelfe the great ſhepheard, beeing the diſtributer and diuider of this Sacrament. I ſhall not need to repeat their words, they are ſo euident and ordinary. Let the margent direct the Reader to them, if they deſire ſatisfaction in this point.
               24. Secondly, many of their owne Doctors ſo interprete it, as Thomas Aquinas, Durand, Biel, Alphonſus de Caſtro, Lorichius, the author of the gloſſe, and diuers others. Caſſanders teſtimony ſhall ſtand in ſtead of all the reſt: he ſayth plainly, that the Weſterne Church beleeued for a thouſand yeeres, that our Sauiour Chriſt gaue this Sacrament to his diſciples, repreſenting the perſons of all the faithfull: and he addeth reaſons, why the wine as well as the bread was to bee receiued; both for a more full repreſentation of the paſſion of Chriſt▪ and ſignification of our full ſpirituall nouriſhment in Chriſt, and alſo the full and perfect redemption of our bodies and ſoules, by the body and ſoule of our Sauiour. This Caſſander repeats to haue beene the opinion of the Latine & Greeke Church, for

the ſpace of a thouſand yeeres. What an vpſtart diſtinction then is this of Bellarmine, who notwithſtanding ceaſeth not to bragge that they haue all antiquity on their ſide?
               25. Thirdly, wee haue Saint `Paul thus interpreting the words of his Lord and Maſter, who ſpake nothing but by the direction of the Spirit: for whereas our Sauiour ſayth, Drinke yee all of it, Saint Paul ſayth, Let a man examine himſelfe,1. Cro. 11. and ſo let him eat of this bread, and drinke of this cup. But all muſt examine themſelues before they come to the ſacrament: therefore, all are enioyned to drinke of the Sacramentall cup: let vs chuſe then whom wee will beleeue, whether Saint Paul or Bellarmine: for Saint Paul interprets this All one way, and Bellarmine cleane contrary.
               26. Laſtly, reaſon it ſelfe diſapprooueth this expoſition: for firſt I would aske him, whether that which our Sauiour commanded to bee done at his laſt Supper, were to bee done once and no more, or often, euen to the end of the world? If hee ſay once, and no more, the words will confute him which ſay, Doe this in remembrance of me: if often, then by All, he meant not the Apoſtles onely; for the Apoſtles liued not till the end of the world. Againe, if by All was intended the Prieſts onely, then not onely the people ſhould bee excluded from the cup, but from the bread alſo: for if in theſe words, Drinke ye all of it, hee ſpeaketh to Prieſts onely, then in theſe words, Eat ye all of it, hee ſpeaketh to none but Prieſts: for they are both ſpoken to one and the ſame perſons. And thus the people ſhould haue no part of the Sacrament at all: for the ſame All that is in one, is in the other. And to conclude, if the Apoſtles ſtood heere in ſtead of Paſtors or Prieſts, why did they not miniſter the Sacrament? It is the part of a Prieſt, as hee is a Prieſt, to miniſter the Sacrament to others, and when hee receiueth it himſelfe, then hee ſtandeth for a common Chriſtian, and not for a Prieſt, for a ſheepe, not for a ſhepheard. But they did not miniſter, but receiue; therefore they ſtood not here for Prieſts, but for the whole body of the faithfull. And thus this diſtinction being battered by the teſtimony

of fathers, confeſſion of their owne Doctors, authority of Saint Paul, and ſtrength of reaſon, doth fall to the ground like Babel: and this fift Antitheſis is nothing weakened by Bellarmines Sophiſtrie.
               27. The Goſpell teacheth, that true repentance, or conuerſion6 Luk. 24. 47. Act. 26. 18. Mark. 1. 15. to God, is an earneſt ſorrow of heart for ſinnes committed, and faith perſwading that they are certainely remitted for Chriſts ſake. But the Church of Rome teacheth, that contrition indeed is one of the parts of repentance: but they faine that it meriteth a remiſſion of ſinnes, and to it they adde auricular confeſſion not commaunded by God, & ſatisfaction, or voluntary workes, by which they ſay, that the puniſhments of ſinne are ſatisfied, & that theſe alſo may be redeemed by money and purſe-penance. All which whole doctrine is very blaſphemous againſt the merit of the Son of God, who onely made ſatisfaction for our ſinnes.
               28. Bellarmine heere from diſtinguiſhing, falleth to rayling, and accuſeth vs of manifeſt lying and falſhood, in laying that to our charge which wee are not guilty of: but whether is the lyar hee, or wee, let the Reader iudge. Firſt therefore, that true repentance is not a bare ſorrow of heart for ſin, but ſuch a ſorrow, as is ioyned with, and ariſeth from faith, appeareth by this, becauſe contrition without faith, leads to deſperation, and not to ſaluation, as the wofull examples of Cain, Eſau, and Iudas declare: and therefore the Romaniſts themſelues doe not exclude all manner of faith from repentance, but onely that faith which apprehendeth remiſſion of ſinnes by Chriſt, which ſpeciall faith, whereby remiſſion of ſinnes is beleeued and obtained, is ioyned with repentance, Luke 24. 47. Act. 26. 18. This is our doctrine, and it is warranted by the holy Scripture: though it pleaſeth Bellarmine to ſay, that it is a bare aſſertion, without Scripture.
               29. As touching their croſſing of it, wee need fetch no other proofe, then from the Councill of Trent, which in expreſſeConcil. Trident. Seſſ. 4. cap. 3. can. 4. words denounceth Anathema to thoſe that make this faith, whereby wee beleeue the remiſſion of our ſinnes, a neceſſary ingredient into true repentance: and yet it propoundeth reconciliation and remiſſion of ſinnes to ſuch as doe repent:

let all the world therefore know, to the eternall ſhame of the Romiſh Religion, that remiſſion of ſinnes, and reconciliation, by their doctrine, may bee obtained by repentance, without faith, then which, what can bee more oppoſite to the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt?
               30. If they reply that they make faith the foundation of repentance, I anſwere, why doe they then exclude it out of repentance? is the foundation no part of the houſe? yes, it is the chiefeſt part: either therefore it is not the foundation of repentance, or els it is neceſſarily required to the eſſence of it; one or the other muſt needs bee falſe: but heere is the myſtery of this iniquity: by faith they meane nor a beliefe of the remiſſion of our ſinnes by the bloud of Chriſt, which is the true Euangelicall faith, but a generall perſwaſion of the truth of their Religion, and a particular conceit, that he which performeth the worke of penance, in the three parts thereof, ſhall thereby obtaine pardon of his ſinnes, and reconciliation with God.
               31. Secondly, whereas hee ſayth, that wee doe not ſatiſfie for the eternall, but for the temporall puniſhments of our ſinnes, either heere in this life, or in Purgatory: hee ſpeaketh nothing for the clearing of their doctrine from oppoſition to the Goſpell▪ for the Goſpell teacheth, that Chriſt our Redeemer hath made a full and perfect ſatisfaction for the ſinnes ofIoh. 1. 29. 1. Ioh. 2. 2. all the world, yeelding a ſufficient and worthy recompence and contentment to God for them: and therefore, they which ſay that wee muſt giue any manner of ſatisfaction our ſelues, whether for the temporall or eternall puniſhment due vnto them, doe euidently croſſe the doctrine of the Goſpell. AndAquin. part. 3. q. 48. art. 4. this Aquinas▪

               32. Thirdly, whereas hee findeth fault with Chytraus, for

ſaying without proofe, that auricular confeſſion is not commanded of God, and yet hee himſelfe doth not proue it is; we might driue out one naile with another, and returne vpon him his owne anſwere: but I reply further, that diuers of his owne fellow Doctors haue auouched aſmuch: for Maldonate,

               33. Laſtly, the redeeming of penance by the purſe, though Bellarmine ſhuffle it ouer neuer ſo cunningly, yet is ſo palpable an abuſe, and ſo contrary to the doctrine of the Goſpell, that the very naming of it, is a ſufficient declaration of the foulneſſe of that Religion, which maketh a mart of ſinne, and ſetteth repentance, which is the gift of God, to ſale, for a little earthly droſſe, and exchangeth puniſhment due to the body and ſoule, for a little pinching of the purſe.
               34. The Goſpell teacheth, that marriage is permitted and7 Heb. 13. 4. 1. Tim. 4. 3. ſet free for all men, both Prieſts and people; and that the prohibition of marriage and meats is a doctrine of Deuils. But the Romiſh Religion forbids marriage to a great part of men, to wit, Prieſts and Monkes, and commands to abſtaine from certaine meates, vpon certaine dayes.
               35. Bellarmine excepteth, and ſaith by a diſtinction, thatBell. de Roman. Pontif. l. 3. c. 23 when the Apoſtle ſayth, Marriage is honourable amongſt all men, hee meaneth not all in generall, for then it ſhould bee honorable betwixt the father and the daughter, the brother and the ſiſter; but onely thoſe that are lawfully ioyned together, which they that are bound with a vow, cannot bee.
               36. It is a ſtrange fore-head, (but no maruaile, ſeeing it

is the fore-head of the whore of Babylon) when the Scripture ſayth, Marriage is honorable amongſt al men, to exempt their Votaries from this honour, as if they were not in the number of men, but beaſts: and as the aſſertion is ſtrange in impudency, ſo the reaſon is more ſtrange in folly: for though the father may not marry the daughter, nor the brother the ſiſter, without inceſt; yet the father may marry, and the daughter may marry, and the brother, and the ſiſter alſo, ſo that they take thoſe that are not prohibited by the Law of God, and nature. Now let him ſhew that Gods Law forbiddeth Votaries to marry, and then hee ſayth ſomething to the purpoſe: but by his owne confeſſion, together with many of his pewfellowes, the prohibition of marriage is no diuine, but humaneCaſſand. conſult. art. 23.

               37. Adde to this impudency and folly, his croſſing of all antiquity: for in the Councill of Nice, Paphnutius alleadgeth this place of Scripture, againſt thoſe that went about to take away the vſe of marriage from the Clergie; and in the ſixt generall Synode, it is expreſſely applied to the ſame purpoſe. And Ierome, in defence of Charterius a married Biſhop, produceth the ſame text.
               38. As touching Chryſoſtomes ſpeech to Theodorus the Monke, alledged by Bellarmine, though it ſeemeth a little to fauour them at the firſt view: yet in another place he cleereth himſelfe from that ſuſpition: for he ſaith plainely, that Marriage is ſo honourable and precious, that a man with it may aſcend into the ſacred Chaire of a Biſhop. What hath Bellarmine got now by Chryſoſtomes teſtimony? Surely this: If all that Chryſoſtome ſaith, bee ſound doctrine, then it is an error in the Church of Rome, to inhibite all that are conſecrated by holy Orders, from the vſe of the marriage bed: For by
                     Aug contra Fauſt. lib. 30. c. 6 
                  Chryſoſtome, Biſhops may marry. Saint Auguſtines teſtimonies, alledged by him in the one and twentieth Chapter, are little to the purpoſe: for in the firſt he ſaith plainely, that the Church of God doth not forbid marriage; but onely preferre

virginitie before it, as a greater good: and in the ſecond hee approoueth onely abſtinence from meates, and that from all in generall; and that to this end, for the caſtigation and mortification of the body: and not eyther for merite ſake, or that it is a thing vnlawfull, or that wee may glut our ſelues with ſome kinde, and may not ſo much as touch others, vpon paine of hereſie, which is the doctrine of the Church of Rome. This is all that S. Auguſtines words import; which, as they doe not deliuer them from oppoſition to the Goſpell, ſo they manifeſtly imply theſe two concluſions: firſt, that the Synagogue of Rome is not the Church of God, for it forbiddeth marriage to Prieſts, not as a leſſer good, but as a thing ſimply euill. And ſecondly, that they maintaine in this their Church that doctrine, which of S. Paul is called, The doctrine of Diuels: for they forbid both Meates and Marriage at ſome times, and to ſome perſons, as things ſinfull and vnlawfull. And whereas the Fathers, almoſt in generall, ſay,Cyprian. lib. 1. cap. 11. Tertul. lib. de monogam. Coſter. Enchir. cap. 17. that it is better for ſuch as haue vowed continency, to marry, then to fall into the fire of luſt; they conclude filthily, to their eternall diſgrace, It is better for a Prieſt to play the whoremonger, and keepe a Concubine, then after his vow of continency to be coupled in wedlocke.
               39. But Bellarmine couereth her nakedneſſe (whereof heBell. quo ſupra. is, as it ſeemeth, ſome what aſhamed) with a figge leafe of a diſtinction: for he ſaith, that fornication is not ſimply better then marriage, but in reſpect that a man hath before entred into a vow, in which regard to marry after the vow, is a greater ſinne then to commit fornication: and this hee proueth by an example from a married woman, whoſe huſband is eyther continually abſent or ſicke, ſo that hee cannot performe the marriage debt vnto her. It is not ſayd vnto her, It is better to marry then to burne; but ſhee ought to keepe her faith to her husband, and by faſting and prayer keepe vnder and tame the concupiſcence of her nature: and therefore, ſaith hee, that precept or permiſſion, Let him marry, is not ſpoken to all, but only to ſuch as are free, and not if they be bound and haue giuen their faith vnto God.
               
                  39. To which I anſwere two things: Firſt, I aske him, whether this vow which 
                     〈◊〉
                   talke of, be onely againſt marriage, or againſt all manner of incontinency? If they ſay that it is the vow of chaſtitie, and that it is againſt all manner of incontinency, then how can it bee that it ſhould bee broken more by marriage, then by fornication, by hauing a wife, then by keeping a whore? and that to marry, in reſpect of the vow, ſhould be a greater ſinne, then to commit whoredome? eſpecially, ſeeing marriage is Gods ordinance, and fornication, of the Diuels inſtitution: that an honourable and holy eſtate, and this a filthy and vgly ſinne. If they ſay that the vow is againſt marriage onely, then what a Religion is Popery, that teacheth her people to vow againſt marriage, and not againſt fornication? againſt wiues and husbands, but not againſt whores and varlets? Surely that Religion that maintaineth this, cannot be of God.
               40. Secondly, to his example I anſwere: Marriage cannot be inioyned to her that is married already, albeit her huſband bee eyther abſent or impotent: for that is contrary to Gods ordinance, Mal. 2. 14. Mat. 19. 5. But the vow of ſingle life is not Gods ordinauce, eſpecially in ſo high a degree as marriage is: for at the moſt it is but a Council, whereas the other is a flat Precept to all that cannot containe: and beſides, they that are married, may expect the bleſſing of God vpon them, vſing the meanes for their reſtraint in a godly manner, and begging continency at Gods hand; becauſe they are in a calling ordayned by God: but they that are in a vow, who either enter raſhly, or are thruſt in againſt their wills, and contrary to Gods Commandement, not being able to abſtaine, but proudly preſume vpon their owne ſtrength, how can they hope for Gods bleſſing vpon them, to ſtrengthen them againſt the temptations of the fleſh? And thus this example, together with the diſtinction it ſelfe, maketh no whit to the iuſtifying of their doctrine; but that it ſtill remayneth in plaine contrariety and oppoſition to the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt.
               41. The Goſpell teacheth, that there is one true and ſolide8.
                  
foundation, vpon which the Church of God is built, 
                     〈◊〉
                   to wit,1. Cor. 3. 11. Act. 4. 11. 12. our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt. But the Romiſh congregation cryeth out, that Peter, and the ordinary ſucceſſion of Popes, and the Church of Rome, is the foundation of the whole Church, and that the Church is built vpon them, and not vpon Chriſt alone.
               42. Bellarmine diſtinguiſheth of foundations, and ſaith, that Chriſt is the primary and principall foundation of the Church: but that doth not hinder, but that there may be ſecundary foundations: and for proofe thereof he alledgeth, Epheſ. 2. 20. where it is ſaid, that we are built the foundation of the Prophets and Apoſtles: and, Apoc. 11. 14. where the twelue Apoſtles are made the twelue foundations of the Church.
               43. To which I anſwere three things: Firſt, that though it be true
                     ••
                  , that the Apoſtles bee the ſecundary foundations of the Church, layd vpon Chriſt the true Rocke and foundation, as twelue goodly ſtones, and that vpon them the Church is built, to wit, vpon Chriſt primarily and principally, and vpon them ſecundarily: yet it doth not take away the Antitheſis of their doctrine to the Goſpell: for they ſay, that Peter is the onely ſecundary foundation, and that hee, as the chiefeſt ſtone, is layd next vnto Chriſt; and the reſt of the Apoſtles built immediately vpon him, and mediately by him vpon Chriſt. But thoſe Scriptures ſay, that the twelue Apoſtles are twelue precious ſtones, laid one by one vpon Chriſt, and not one vpon another: and twelue foundations equally proportioned to each other, and not one placed vpon the top of another: and ſo it is true, that as the prerogatiue of the onely ſingular foundation belongeth to Chriſt, ſo the honour of being ſecundary foundations, is equally deuided among the twelue Apoſtles: and ſo Peter in this reſpect hath no greater prerogatiue then the reſt. And therefore this diſtinction deliuers them not from the ſnare, ſeeing that it maketh all the twelue Apoſtles altogether ioynt-foundations of the Church: and they would haue Peter to bee the onely foundation next vnto Chriſt, vpon whom both the Church of

God, and the Apoſtles themſelues are built.
               44. Secondly, I anſwere, that when the Apoſtles are ſaid
                     Aug. de verb. Dom. ſer. 13. Greg. Nyſſen. in teſtim. ex veter. teſtam. de trinit. contra Iudaeos. Cyril. de trin. l. 4. Chryſ. in Mat. hom. 55. Ambr. in Epheſ. cap. 2. Hilar. de trinit. lib. 2. Bell. praefat. controuerſ. de ſum. Pont. Eſay 28. 16. 1. Pet. 2. 6. 8. to be foundations of the Church, it is not meant of their perſons, but of their doctrine, as witneſſe almoſt all the Fathers: for concerning perſon, it is true which Saint Paul ſaith, No man can lay any other foundation beſide that which is layd, Ieſus Chriſt, 1. Cor. 3. 11. But the Romaniſts would not haue the doctrine of Peter, but the perſon of Peter to be this foundation: and for proofe thereof Bellarmine fetcheth this argument from the Prophet Eſay, ſaying, Behold, I will lay in Sion a ſtone, a ſure foundation: which is a playne and manifeſt Prophecie of Chriſt, and not of Peter, as the Apoſtle Peter himſelfe expoundeth it: where, by the way, we may note the feareful outrage of theſe Romiſh Rabbies againſt the truth of God, and the God of truth, whilſt, to the end they may aduance their Popes dignity by Peter, they wreſt and peruert the Scriptures, and apply the Prophecies belonging to the Sonne of God, to his ſeruant Peter, and ſo make Peter himſelfe, nay, the holy Ghoſt, a Lyar. It were not credible, that ſuch blaſphemous thoughts and words ſhould neſtle in the heart, and iſſue out of the mouth of any, but that the Apoſtle Saint Paul hath fore-told vs, that in the time of Antichriſt, becauſe men would not receiue the loue of the truth, that they
                  2. Theſ. 2. 10. 11 
                  might be ſaued: therefore God would ſend them ſtrong deluſions, that they ſhould beleeue lyes, &c. But to the point: If Chriſts perſon be the onely true foundation of the Church, in whom all the building, being coupled together, groweth vnto anEpheſ. 2. 21. holy Temple in the Lord: and that not the perſons, but the doctrine, and faith of the Apoſtles, are thoſe ſecundary foundations which the Scripture ſpeaketh of, as hath beene proued out of the Fathers: then the oppoſition is vndefeaſible, namely, that there is but one perſon the foundation of our Church, which is our Lord and Sauiour, the Sonne of God, Chriſt Ieſus; and yet that Peters perſon ſhould be the foundation of the Church alſo together with Chriſt.
               45. Thirdly, I anſwere, that both in truth, and alſo in proprietie of ſpeech, there can bee but one foundation of

one building: thoſe ſtones that are layd next to the foundation, are not properly a ſecundary foundation, but the beginning of the building vpon the foundation: and for that cauſe, when Peter, and the reſt of the Apoſtles are called twelue foundations, it cannot bee vnderſtood, that they were any wayes properly foundations of the Church, either firſt or ſecond: but that our Sauiour, who is the ſubſtance and ſubiect of their doctrine, is the onely true and ſingular foundation of the Church, and that there is none other beſides him: for if, when it is ſaid that we are built vpō the foundation of the Prophets and Apoſtles, is meant the doctrine of the Prophets and Apoſtles, as muſt needes bee, becauſe the Prophets are coupled together with the Apoſtles, which liued not in the Chriſtian Church, and therefore could not be perſonall foundations of it, and Chriſt crucified is the ſubſtance of their doctrine: then it muſt needes follow, that the Apoſtles meaning is nothing elſe, but that we are built vpon Chriſt, whom the Prophets and the Apoſtles preached and beleeued in. And thus S. Hilary vnderſtood it, and Saint Ambroſe, and Anſelmus,
                  Hilar. de Trin. lib. 6. & lib. 2. Ambroſe. Anſelmus. who giuing the foundation of the Church to Peter, expoundeth it ſometimes of his faith in Chriſt, and ſometimes of Chriſt himſelfe, in whom he beleeued. And thus doe alſo Salmeron the Ieſuite, and Cardinall Caietane in their commentariesSalmeron. Caietane. vpon that place, and Peter Lumbard, together with the gloſſe vpon the place, interpret. And ſo this diſtinction of a primary and ſecundary foundation, hath no foundation in the word of God.
               46. The Goſpell teacheth, that no Apoſtle or Biſhop, or other9. Luk. 22. 26. Ioh. 20. 22, 23. Mat. 18. 18. 1. Cor. 3. 4. 5. Miniſter of the Goſpell, is ſuperiour to another of the ſame ranke, or hath greater power and authority then another, in reſpect of their miniſterie; but that all Miniſters in their ſeuerall degrees, haue equall power of preaching the Goſpell, adminiſtring the Sacraments, binding, and looſing: But the Biſhop of Rome challengeth to himſelfe a ſupreme power ouer all other Biſhops, and ouer the whole Church, and braggeth that he hath by right, a title to both the ſwords, both ſpirituall and temporall, and that both iuriſdictions doe

originally pertaine to him, and from him are conueyed to others, &c.
               47. Bellarmine heere firſt confeſſeth, and ſecondly diſtinguiſheth: hee confeſſeth, that the Biſhop of Rome hath a ſupreme power ouer all other Biſhops and the whole Church: and denyeth that eyther thoſe places here quoted, or any other doe prooue the contrary.
               48. To which I anſwere: firſt, that whereas out of Luke 22. 26. and 1. Cor. 3. 4. he extracteth a diſparity, and an inequality: I anſwere, that no man denyeth it; and therefore he fighteth with his owne ſhadow: hee ſhould prooue not a bare ſuperiority, which wee confeſſe, but a ſuperiority in the ſame degree; as of one Biſhop to another, and that in power, not in execution, wherein ſtandeth the point of oppoſition.
               49. Secondly, whereas he ſaith, that though the power of remitting and retayning finnes, and binding and looſing, was communicated to all the Apoſtles, yet Peter was ordayned chiefe Paſtor ouer them all; becauſe our Sauiour Chriſt ſayd vnto him alone, Feede my ſheepe: and, To thee will I giue the Keyes of the Kingdome of heauen: I anſwere, that in this hee croſſeth both himſelfe, the Fathers, and the truth: himſelfe, for elſewhere hee confeſſeth, that the keyes, both of OrderBell. de Rom. Pontif. l. 1. c. 22. and Iuriſdiction, were giuen to all the Apoſtles indifferently: and therefore it muſt needes follow, that Tibi dabo claues, was not ſpoken ſingularly, to Peter, but generally, to them all: for if Chriſt gaue the keyes to them all, as he confeſſeth, then without doubt he promiſed them to them all, or elſe his word and his deede ſhould not accord together. And againe, hee acknowledgeth that all the Apoſtles had both power and commiſſion to feede the ſheepe of Chriſt, when (Mat. 28.) he bade them all, Goe, teach and baptize: and they all did put that commiſſion in execution: therefore it muſt needes follow, that no ſingular power was giuen to Peter, when as Chriſt ſaid vnto him, Feede my ſheepe, vnleſſe we will ſay, that the reſt had not the ſame commiſſion.
               50. The Fathers: for Saint Cyprian ſaith plainely, that all
                  Cyprian. de ſimplicit. praelat. 
                  the Apoſtles were the ſame with Peter, indued with equall fellowſhip
                  
                  both of honour and power, and that a primary was giuen vnto
                  Hilar de Trin. lib. 6. Peter, that the Church might appeare to be one. Saint Hilary is of the ſame minde, You, O holy and bleſſed men (ſaith he) for the merit of your faith, haue receiued the keyes of the kingdome of heauen, and obtained a right to binde and looſe in Heauen and earth. Saint Auguſtine ſaith, that if when Chriſt ſaid, To thee
                  Aug. in Iohan. tract. 50. 
                  will I giue the keyes of the kingdome of Heauen, he ſpake onely to Peter, then the Church hath not the power of the keyes: but if the Church hath it, then Peter receiuing the keyes, repreſented the Church. And laſtly, Leo, one of their owne Popes, confeſſethLeo ſer. 3. de vniuerſ. aſſump ſuae. aſmuch, when hee affirmeth, that the ſtrength of this power of the keyes, paſſed vnto all the Apoſtles, and the conſtitution of this decree vnto all the Princes of the Church.
               
               51. Laſtly, the truth: for when the Apoſtles ſtroue for ſuperiority, Chriſt, who is truth it ſelfe, and would not haue concealed ſo neceſſary a trueth, if it had bene a truth, vpon ſo fit an occaſion, neuer preferred Peter, but exhorteth all, and ſo Peter alſo, to equality and humility: yea, not onely ſo, but expreſſely forbad all king-like and monarchicall ſuperiority amongſt them; and not onely tyrannicall, as Bellarmine would haue it, as may euidently appeare by comparing Luk. 22. 26. with 1. Pet. 5. 3.
               52. Thus hee confeſſeth their doctrine: next he commeth to diſtinguiſh of it, namely, that their Apoſtolicall power was equall in reſpect of the people, but yet not equall betweene themſelues; in which reſpect Peter was not onely a common Paſtour with his fellow Apoſtles, but extraordinarily paſtor paſtorū, a Paſtour of the Paſtours, that is, of the Apoſtles thē
                  ſelues: this is his diſtinction: but it is idle and vaine, as may appeare by this reaſon: becauſe, if he were the chiefe Paſtour of the Apoſtles, then he either ordained them to their offices, or fed them with his doctrine, or gouerned them by his authority, or did ſome part of the office of a Paſtour vnto them: but hee neither ordained them; for Chriſt himſelfe did that:Ioh. 20. 21. Act. 2. 3. nor
                     •
                  ed them with doctrine; for they were all taught of God, and equally receiued the holy Ghoſt, which did lead them into all truth: nor gouerned them; for they ſent him, hee did not

ſend them, and called him to an account, he did not call them; and therefore was no wayes to be eſteemed their Paſtour and ſuper-intendent, but their equall, and Co-Apoſtle.
               53. And whereas hee defendeth the extrauagant of Pope Boniface (which is ſo rightly termed, for containing a moſt extrauagant doctrine from the truth) hee muſt needs defend this double iuriſdiction by the ſpeech of Peter to our Sauior, Ecce duo gladii, behold, heere are two ſwords, and his anſwere to the ſame, It is enough: with how abſurd a collection it is, let his owne fellowes bee Iudges. Franciſcus de Victoria, Stella, Maldonate, Arias Montanus, and Suares the Ieſuite: All which, with many others, reiect this collection of theirs, as moſt abſurd, and impertinent: I conclude, if Pope Boniface did extrauagate in that extrauagant, in the application of this place, why doe they hold, that the Pope cannot erre iudicially? If hee did not, whydoe ſo many learned men of his owne ſide contradict him? Either ſure the Popes two ſwords are ru

                  ie, and cannot bee vnſheathed, or els hee would neuer ſuffer his authority to bee thus diminiſhed, not onely by his enemies, but euen by thoſe that fight vnder his owne banner. And thus this Antitheſis alſo ſtands vnblemiſhed, for all that is yet ſaid to the contrary.
               54. The Goſpell teacheth, that there is but one Mediator10 1. Tim. 2. 5. 6. 1. Ioh. 2. 1. Ioh. 14. 13. Ioh. 14. 6. Heb. 9. 15. betwixt God and man, euen the God-man Ieſus Chriſt, and that hee beeing the onely Propitiatour, is alſo the onely Mediatour. But the Church of Rome teacheth, that as many Saints as are in Heauen, ſo many Mediatours and Interceſſours wee haue to God; and among the reſt, the bleſſed Virgin, the mother of our Lord, whom they call their Aduocatreſſe, Deliuereſſe, Mediatreſſe, Sauioureſſe, and Comfortreſſe.
               55. Bellarmine ſeeketh to eſcape from this Contradiction,Bell. de Sanctor. beatit. l. 1. c. 20. by a threefold diſtinction: firſt hee ſayth, that Chriſt indeed is the onely Mediatour of redemption, because hee onely made reconciliation betwixt God and vs, by paying the ranſome for our ſinnes; but neuertheleſſe the Saints are Mediatours of interceſſion, by praying for vs. This he barely affirmeth, without any proofe; and therefore it ſeemeth he would haue vs take it vpon his word for current coyne, without any

tryall: but wee haue learned out of Gods word, to try the ſpirits, and to weigh all ſuch ware in the balance of the Sanctuary: and therefore finding by the Scripture, that Chriſt did not onely pay the ranſome for our ſinnes, but alſo, that hee maketh requeſt for vs. and not finding in all the booke of God, that the Saints in Heauen either doe preſent our prayers vnto God, or make requeſt for our particular neceſſities, wee haue iuſt cauſe to reiect this diſtinction, as too light ware, and as counterfeit coyne.
               56. I but (ſayth hee) the Saints triumphant pray for the Saints militant, therefore they are their Mediators. I anſwere, Though it be granted that they do pray for them in generall, which indeed is not denyed: and in particular, which can neuer be proued; yet the argument hath no good conſequence, that therefore they ſhould bee our Mediatours: for (as Bellarmine
                  Ball. de Chriſt
                        •
                      Mediat. l. 5. c. 5. himſelfe confeſſeth) A Mediatour muſt bee a middleman, differing from each party at variance, after ſome ſort: but the Saints triumphant are not medi
                        •
                     , betwixt God and vs, both becauſe in preſence they are alwayes with God, and neuer with vs, and alſo in ſemblance more like to God, then vnto vs, for they are perfectly happy, holy, and righteous, we beeing miſerable, ſinfull, and wicked: and in knowledge they are ſatisfied with heauenly obiects, and haue no participation with humane affaires: being therefore thus far remooued from vs, and ſo neere knit vnto God in all theſe, by his owne rule, they cannot any wayes bee our Mediatours, neither of redemption, nor interceſſion.
               57. His ſecond diſtinction is that Chriſt is called the onely Mediatour, becauſe hee is the Mediatour, not onely in regard of his office, but alſo of his nature, for that hee is in the middeſt betwixt God and man, hee himſelfe beeing God and man. To which I anſwere, that it is moſt true which hee ſayth, but yet it is both contrary to that which hee himſelfe hath deliuered elſewhere, and alſo ouerthroweth that which hee holdeth heere: for the firſt, he laboureth to proue in another place, that Chriſt is the Mediatour onely in reſpect of his humane nature, and here hee ſayth, in reſpect of both natures:

how can theſe bee reconciled? mary, by another diſtinction: It is one thing (ſayth hee) to bee a Mediatour in reſpect of perſon,
                  
                     Bell. de Chriſto Mediat. l. 1. cap. 1. 3. 4. 
                  and another thing in reſpect of operation: in the firſt, Chriſt is the Mediatour by both natures in the ſecond, by his humane nature onely. As if hee did not operate and worke the Mediation in the ſame reſpect that hee is Mediatour. I, but hee will ſay, the chiefe worke of our redemption was the death of Chriſt, but the God-head cannot dye: therfore, &c. I anſwere, Though Chriſt died as he was man, yet the perſon that died, was God and man: for (as Tolet his fellow Ieſuite and CardinallTolet. comment. in Iob. 10. obſerueth) Chriſt dyed not as other men, in whoſe power it is not, either to hold the ſoule in the body, or to recall it backe againe, being expelled: but Chriſt ioyned his ſoule and body together at his pleaſure: as hee that holding a ſword in one hand, and a ſcabbard in another, puls it out, or thruſts it in at his pleaſure. By which it is plaine, that though Chriſt dyed in reſpect of his man-hood, yet the author of his death was his God-head, & ſo he is our Mediatour in both natures. Secondly, he ouerthroweth his own poſitiō, by this diſtinctiō: for firſt, if Chriſt bee the only Mediatour in reſpect of office and of nature; then the Saints are no wayes our Mediatours: for if they bee, they muſt bee one of theſe two wayes, vnleſſe wee will ſay, that they doe that which belongs not vnto them, but like buſy-bodies, are pragmaticall in anothers charge: which, farre bee it from vs to thinke of thoſe bleſſed creatures; but both theſe wayes (he ſayth) Chriſt is the onely Mediatour; therefore the Saints, by his owne concluſion, are no Mediatours at all.
               58. His third diſtinction is, that therefore Chriſt is called the onely Mediatour, becauſe hee prayeth for all, and none for him: but the Saints are ſuch Mediatours, that they themſelues ſtand in need of a Mediatour. I anſwere, that therefore they are no Mediatours at all: for if the Saints in Heauen ſtand in need of a Mediatour themſelues, then it muſt neceſſarily follow, that they are not Mediatours at all: for they that are parties, cannot bee vmpiers. And this is that whichAug. contra

                     ar. l. 2. cap. 8. Saint Auguſtine plainely affirmeth (though Bellarmine laboureth

to diſtort his words to another ſenſe) when he ſayth, He, for whom none intreateth, but hee intreateth for all, is the onely true Mediatour. And thus it is cleare, that the doctrine of the Church of Rome, touching the mediation of Saints, is directly contrary to the doctrine of the Goſpell.
               59. The Goſpell teacheth, that Chriſt Ieſus hath made aII 1. Ioh. 1. 7. 1. Ioh. 2. 2. Eſay. 53. 45. full and perfect ſatisfaction for all our debts, and ſo is our full and perfect Redeemer: But the Church of Rome teacheth, that Chriſt hath ſatisfied but in part for our debts, to wit, neither for all our ſinne, nor for all the puniſhment due vnto all our ſinne, and ſo that he is not our full and perfect Redeemer.
               60. This doctrine of the Goſpell is ſo euidently propounded in holy Scripture, that our aduerſaries themſelues acknowledge it in generall to bee true: for Aquinas, where the Apoſtle ſayth, I ſuffer all things for the Elects ſake, that they may alſo obtaine the ſaluation which is in Chriſt Ieſus, askethAqui in 2. Tim. 2. lect. 2. this queſtion, What, was not the paſſion of Chriſt ſufficient? and anſwereth to the ſame, Yes; as touching the working of ſaluation. And Bayus ſayth, that there is but one ſatisfaction onely vnto God, and that of Chriſt: yea, Bellarmine himſelfeBayus de Indulg. cap. vlt. Bell. de Purgat. lib. 9. cap. 10. acknowledgeth aſmuch in generall; for hee affirmeth, that the merit of Chriſt is ſufficient to take away all ſinne and puniſhment: neither dare any of the reſt for ſhame in plaine words deny the ſame: becauſe, if they did, many manifeſt texts of Scripture would conuince them of impiety and hereſie.

Yea, they affirme not onely, that wee our ſelues muſt ſatisfie for the temporall puniſhment, but alſo for the relikes of ſinne, and for the fault it ſelfe; yea, for that puniſhment that ſhould bee ſuffered in hell, excepting the eternity: yea, ſo impious and ſhameleſſe are ſome of them, whoſe bookes are notwithſtanding authorized by the Church of Rome, that they affirme, that Chriſt dyed onely for originall

ſinne, and that the ſatisfaction of Chriſt deſerueth not theAquin. tom. 17. Opuſ 58. Sacra. Altar. cap. 1. fol. 41. Col. 2. Tapper. tom. 1. art. 6. pag. 154. Biel. 3. Diſt. 18. & 19. Scot. Durand. Biel. in Suares tom. 1. diſp. 4. ſect. 11. name of a ſatisfaction for our ſinnes. Let the world iudge now, whether theſe poſitions of the Church of Rome bee not flat contrary of the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt: for the Goſpell attributeth to Chriſt all ſufficiencie of meriting and ſatisfaction: but theſe fellowes make him a Satisfier party parpale for the ſinne, but not the puniſhment, & yet not for all our ſinnes neither, but for a part of them: as for originall, & not actuall; or iffor actuall, yet for mortall onely, and not for veniall. And this is the Romiſh Religion, though palliated with the name of Catholicke, and hidden from the ſight of the common people, vnder the vaile of an implicite faith: which, if they ſhould but ſee, they could not chuſe but abhorre.
               62. For the healing of this wound, Bellarmine applyeth his wonted playſter of a diſtinction. Chriſts ſatisfaction (ſaithBell. de Purgat. 
                        •
                     . 1. cap. 10. he) is in vertue ſufficient, but not in act efficient, except it bee applyed by our ſatisfaction: and therefore that there is but one onely actuall ſatisfaction, which is ours; which by the grace and efficacy of Chriſts ſatisfaction, taketh away the puniſhment of our ſinne, and maketh a iuſt recompence to God for the ſame.
               63. But this diſtinction firſt vndermineth it ſelfe: for if Chriſts bee a ſatisfaction, then it is an actuall ſatisfaction: if it bee not an actuall one, then it is none at all. Did not he actually dye, and riſe againe? Did not hee actually by that death of his, ſatisfy Gods iuſtice for all the Elect? Doth not the ſtrength and efficacy ofhis death ſtretch it ſelfe backward to Adam, and forward to the laſt beleeuing child of Adam vpon earth? If all this bee true, then it muſt needs bee intolerable blaſphemy, to ſay, that actually there is no ſatisfaction, but our owne, and that Chriſts ſatisfaction which hee made for our ſinnes, is indeed no ſatisfaction, except it bee by the meanes of ours, which muſt apply it, and as it were, giue efficacy vnto it.
               64. Againe, the ground of his diſtinction is abſurd: for where doth the Scripture make our ſatisfaction a meanes to

apply Chriſts ſatisfaction vnto vs? It telleth vs of otherRom. 10. 17. 1. Cor. 10. 16. Gal. 2. 27. Epheſ. 3. 17. meanes of application, to wit, outward, the Word and Sacraments: inward, faith in reſpect of vs, and the Spirit, in reſpect of God: but no where of this new-deuiſed meanes, which they talke of: and beſides, how can our ſatisfactions apply Chriſts vnto vs, whereas they are both ſatisfaction, and that to God, and that for our ſinnes? Nay, when as hee ſayth, that our ſatisfaction doth include the ſatisfaction of Chriſt in it, and ſo both together make but one compound ſatisfaction: if they be of one natur

                   how can one apply the other? If they bee one in mixture, and compoſition, how is the one ſeuered from the other? Theſe bee abſurd inconſequences, and irreconciliable.
               65. Laſtly, if the ſtrength & power of ſatisfying, which is in our ſufferings, is wholly from the grace of God, & the vertue

By which, he plainely diuideth our merits from Chriſt, and aſcribeth a ſatisfactory power to them, equall to the death of Chriſt it ſelfe, and that without the helpe of grace. Nay, why do they not ſay plainly, that Chriſt hath ſatisfied for vs, without any intermixing of our owne; but that their wiſedome perceiued, that then Purgatory, Maſſes, Penance, Romiſh pardons, yea, and the Popes Kitchin it ſelfe, and the very marrow of all their Pompe, ſhall fall to the ground? And this indeed is the very ground of this blaſphemous doctrine.
               66. Doctour Biſhop, miſliking this diſtinction, as it
                     Biſhops anſwere to Maſter Perkins reformed Catholike. ſeemeth, flyeth to another. In ſinne (ſayth hee) there are two things, the one is the turning away from God, whom wee offend: The other is, the turning to the thing, for the loue of which wee offend. Now, the turning away from GOD, both the ſinne, and the eternall paine,
                  
                  due vnto it, are freely through Chriſt pardoned: but for the pleaſure we tooke in ſinne, wee our ſelues are to ſatisfie, and according to the greatneſſe thereof, to doe penance. Thus dreameth Doctor Biſhop: but let his owne fellow Doctor waken him, and he of greater credit then himſelfe: Aquinas it is, who reiecteth this
                     Aquin. ſuplem. q. 13. art. 1. diſtinction, as nothing worth, and giueth this reaſon of his reiecting, becauſe ſatisfaction anſwereth not to ſinne, but according as it is an offence to God, which it hath not of conuerting to other things, but of auerting and turning from God. And ſurely his reaſon is paſſing good: for to v
                     ••
                   the Creatures, and to loue the Creatures, is not ſinne: but to vſe them diſorderly, and to loue them immoderately: which diſordered vſe, & immoderate loue, is the very turning, and auerſion from God: and therefore, to ſay, that wee ſatisfy not for our auerſion from God, but for our conuerſion to the creatures, is to ſay, either that wee ſatisfy for that which is no ſinne, or els, that ſome part of ſinne is not an auerſion from God: both which, are equally abſurd, and Doctor Biſhop cannot giue a third: and therefore his diſtinction is a meere foppiſh dreame, without head or foote.
               67. The Goſpell teacheth, that there is giuen no other12 Act.

But the Church of Rome propoundeth vnto vs other names to bee ſaued by, as, the Virgin Mary, the Saints, and Martyrs, yea, Francis, and Dominick, &c. For they make them Mediatours of interceſſion to God for vs: which office belongeth only vnto Chriſt, as hath been ſhewed; and they teach, that we are ſaued by their merits, aſwell as by the merits of Chriſt; and that as there are diuers manſions in Heauen, ſo among the Saints there are diuers offices; ſome haue power ouer one thing, ſome ouer another, as Saint Peter againſt infidelity. Saint Agnes for Chaſtity. Saint Leonard for Horſes. Saint Nicholas againſt ſhip-wracke. Saint Iames for Spaine. Saint Denis for France. Saint Marke for Venice, &c. Yea, they would make men beleeue, if a man, being otherwiſe a vyler ſinner, dye in the habit of Saint Francis, or Saint Dominick, &c. muſt needes goe ſtraight to heauen,

without any more adoe: and that, as it may ſeeme, though he hath neyther faith nor repentance.
               68. Laſtly, they are not aſhamed to ſay, that the death and paſſion of Chriſt, and of the holy Virgine together, wasGalat. de arcan. Catholic. verita

If this be not to repoſe the confidence of our ſaluation vpon other names, beſides the Name of Ieſus, let the world be iudge.
               69. Yet for all this, they thinke to couer this their filthineſſe by a diſtinction: for they ſay that they doe not flyeBell. de Sanct. beatit. l. 1. c. 17. to the Saints, as authors and giuers of good things; but as Impetrators and Interceſſors. To which I anſwere▪ that to omit their doctrine which hath at large beene diſcouered before, the very forme of their prayers doth extinguiſh this diſtinction: for when they cry and ſay, O Saint Peter, haue mercy on me, Saue mee, Open mee the gate of heauen, Giue mee patience, Giue mee fortitude, &c. And to the bleſſed Virgine, O Mediatrix of God and men: ô Fountaine of mercy, Mother of grace, Hope of the deſolate, Comforter of the deſperate, &c. receiue this my humble petition, and giue me life euerlaſting: And to Saint Paul, Vouchſafe to bring vs, whom thou haſt cauſed to know the light of truth, after the end of this mortality, thither, where thou thy ſelfe art: Doe they not make them authors and giuers of theſe things? Yes, in word, (ſaith Bellarmine) but not in ſenſe: for the meaning of theſeBell. Ibid. petitions is, that by their prayers and merites they would obtaine of God theſe good things. But, alas, how ſhould the common people vnderſtand their meaning, ſeeing the ſound of their words are ſo playne to the contrary? Againe, why doe they not propound their ſenſe in playner termes, but leaue it thus inuolued vnder darke riddles, to the great offence of thouſands? And laſtly, how harſh an interpretation muſt this needs be in the eares of all men, Giue me euerlaſting life, that is, Pray to God that he would giue mee it? If a man

ſhould ſpeake ſo in his common talke, no man would vnderſtand him otherwiſe then his words ſound: how much leſſe can theſe ſpirituall matters be otherwiſe vnderſtood then they are ſpoken? Surely this ſhift is ſo filly, that if it might ſtand good, what might not a man ſpeake, and yet excuſe it ſufficiently after this manner? And though the Councill of Trent ſeeme to graunt to the Saints the power onely of interceſſion, as Bellarmine alſo doth: yet the Romane Catechiſme, ſetCatechiſ. Rom. foorth by the commandement of the Pope, and decree of the ſame Councill, doth cleerely and expreſſely attribute vnto the Saints the power of Mercy, Grace, and Donation of benefits. Whereby it appeareth, that this is not the opinion of ſome priuate men, but the receiued and approoued doctrine of the Church. And thus this diſtinction vaniſheth before the truth, as ſnow againſt the Sunne.
               70. The Goſpell teacheth, that euery ſoule bee ſubiect to

                  the higher powers: and that we ſubmit our ſelues vnto all maner of ordinance for the Lords ſake, whether vnto King or vnto Gouernours, &c. And our Sauiour himſelfe confeſſeth, thatIoh. 19. 11. 
                  Pilate had power euer him from God, when he faith, Thou couldeſt haue no power at all againſt me, except it were giuen thee from aboue. But the Church of Rome teacheth, that neyther the Pope himſelfe, nor any of his Clergie, are ſubiect to the temporall power of Princes, eyther to be iudged of them, or puniſhed by them, no not in caſes of fact, when they are guilty of haynous crimes; as of Treaſon, Murther, Theft, &c.
               71. This doctrine, though it bee contradicted by many learned Doctors of their owne ſide: as, Occham, Marſilius, Pataninus, Barclay a late French Lawyer, and others, yet is maintayned by their Popes and Cardinalls, Ieſuites, and Canon Lawes, which are the very ſynewes of Popery, as not onely true, but neceſſary to ſaluation: and therefore we may well call it, The doctrine of their Church. For Popes: Iohn
                  Auguſt. Triump. de poteſt. eccleſ. 4. 4. art. 1. the two and twentieth commaunded Auguſtinus Triumphus of Ancona, to write a Booke, wherein he maintaineth this poſition, That all the power of Emperours and Kings is ſubdeligate, in reſpect of the power of the Pope. And againe, that all ſecular power is to be reſtrayned, enlarged, and executed

at the commaundement ofthe Pope. This is the aſſertion of that man, who was authoriſed firſt to write by Pope Iohn the two and twentieth, and after, his Booke was ſet foorth, by the priuiledge of Gregory the thirteenth. So that here we haue two Popes maintayning this doctrine. Clement the firſt was of the ſame minde, who affirmeth, that hee, andClement. lib. 2. de ſentent. & re iudicat. can. 2. the reſt of the Popes, had a ſoueraignity and ſuperiority ouer the Empire: and vpon that ground he diſſanulled all the Sentences and Proceſſes made by Henry the ſeuenth Emperour. And ſo alſo was Boniface the eighth, who in that famous Canon,Extrauag. Com. lib. 1. de maior. & obedient. c. vnam Sanctam. 
                  Vnam ſanctam, &c. directly affirmeth, that the Temporall authority muſt be ſubiect to the Spirituall: and that it is neceſſary to ſaluation, to beleeue that euery humane creature is ſubiect to the Pope of Rome. Now the reſt of the Popes muſt needes be of the ſame minde, or elſe they ſhould condemne theſe of error, and that ſpeaking definitiuely, which is contrary to their Religion. And ſo indeede that they are, Bellarmine their Champion, in his late Booke againſt Barclay the Lawyer, doth manifeſtly declare, who moſt impudently maintayneth this poſition with all his wit againſt that learned man: as alſo in his laſt doting Apologie againſt our King, wherein, without doubt, he is authoriſed, and as it were tapped on the backe, and called, A good childe, by the Popes Holineſſe himſelfe.
               72. Thus we ſee this doctrine maintayned by the Popes and their Lawes. Let vs ſee alſo what the Cardinalls and the Ieſuites ſay vnto it. Cardinall Baronius, a notable clawer ofBaronius. the Popes, holdeth, that the Pope hath power directly ouer Princes, agreeing with Bozius and Triumphus: but Cardinall Bellarmine, with others on his ſide, quallifieth the matter, andBell. de Rom. Pontif. lib. 5. cap. 4 & 5. ſaith, that the Popes power ouer Princes in temporall matters, is not direct, but indirect, as depending vpon his ſpirituall power, and in order & relation vnto that. Let vs leaue theſeGreg. de Ʋalen. tom. 3. Com. Tollet. in Ioh. cap. 21. two Cardinalls fighting about direct & indirect, and come to the other Ieſuites. Gregory de Valentia ſaith, that the Pope is ſubiect to none; but that by a certaine hereditary right he is exempted from all humane juriſdiction. Tollet affirmeth, that there may bee in the Church many holier and learneder then

the Pope, but none ſuperior or equall vnto him in dignitie. Turrian the Ieſuite ſaith, that Chriſt hath tranſlated all hisTurrian. de Eccleſ. l. 1. c. 3. Kingdome on earth vpon the Pope, who beareth his perſon, and carryeth his Image. And laſtly, all of them, like lines in a circle, meeting in a Center, ioyne in this, that the Pope hath power to depoſe Kings, to tranſlate Kingdomes, and to conferre them vpon others, if it ſeeme to him neceſſary for the good of mens ſoules.
               73. Thus we haue their doctrine concerning their Head, the Pope. Now let vs heare what they ſay touching the body that hangs vpon his head, their Clergie: Kings are not now any more Soueraignes ouer Clerks (faith Bellarmine,) and
                  Bell. de Cleric. cap. 28. 
                  therefore Clerks are not bound to obey them by Gods law or mans, except it be in reſpect of directiue lawes. And Emanuel Sa. affirmeth,Emanuel. Sa. Aphoriſ. confeſ. verb. Cler. that a Clergie man cannot be a Traytor, though hee rebell, becauſe he is no ſubiect. And it was long agoe the doctrine of the Fryers; continued by the Ieſuites, that the King was not Lord ouer the Clergie; but that the Pope was their Lord: and therefore though a Clergie man had committed theft, murther, or treaſon, yet hee ought not to bee called in queſtion, much leſſe puniſhed for it by a temporall Magiſtrate: butHoueden. Hen. 2 ought to be iudged by Eccleſiaſticall Iudges, & in the Eccleſiaſticall Court: and if hee were conuict, hee ſhould loſe his Orders, and ſo being excluded from Office & Benefice Ecclefiaſticall: if after this he incurred the like fault, then might he be iudged at the pleaſure of the King: yea, they goe ſo farre,Maynard de Priuiledg. eccleſ. art. 17. nu. 10. that if any offence were committed by diuers perſons, amongſt whom there were one Clergie man, none of the offenders were ſubiect to temporall iuriſdiction. And thus we ſee, that neyther the Pope nor his Clergie will bee ſubiect to theſe higher Powers, to which the Goſpell commaundeth all men to ſubmit themſelues.
               74. How will they diſtinguiſh here? Mary, they haue two diſtinctions to helpe this doctrine out of the myre, and yet all too weake. Firſt, they ſay, that when the Apoſtles, Paul and Peter, commanded euery ſoule to bee ſubiect, &c. they meane generally, that all ſubiects ſhould obey their ſuperiors,

whether Spirituall or Temporall: and not that eueryBell. de Rom. Pontif. l. 2. c. 29. one ſhould particularly bee ſubiect to the King or ſecular power: which interpretation is firſt flat contrary to the text: for both Paul and Peter mention expreſſely Kings and Princes, and ſuch as haue the right of the ſword: which they would neuer haue done, if Kings ſhould haue beene ſubiect to Popes, and not Popes to Kings: for then they would haue inſtanced in Popes, and not in Kings: and though Chriſtians were falſely accuſed of treaſon and rebellion to Princes, yet this could not be a ſufficient reaſon to mooue the Apoſtles to conceale ſo neceſſary a truth, eſpecially ſeeing they write to Chriſtians and not to Infidels.
               75. Secondly, it is contrary to reaſon: for if Peter, and ſo the Pope, his pretended ſucceſſor, had beene in their iudgement ſuperiors to Kings, then ſurely Peter himſelfe, writing not onely to the people, but alſo to the Elders of the Church, as appeareth, 1. Pet. 5. 1. would neuer haue enioyned them all to the obedience of the Ciuill Magiſtrate, but would haue reſerued ſome to his owne iuriſdiction, and bidden them all, both Magiſtrate and people, to ſubmit themſelues vnto him, as the head of the Church: or if he for modeſtie might forbeare this imperiall iniunction; yet, without queſtion, Paul (had he beene of that minde) would not haue ſent euery ſoule to bee ſubiect to Kings, but would haue told them, that Kings and all ſhould be ſubiect to Peter: but ſeeing that neither of them both doth it, neither here nor elſewhere; and it is, as they thinke, ſo neceſſary a thing to be beleeued of all men, it is moſt euident that they neuer meant it.
               76. Thirdly, and laſtly, whereas the Apoſtle Paul commaundeth euery ſoule to be ſubiect, wee may conclude, that if the Pope be a ſoule, or haue a ſoule (for ſome of them haue thought that a man had no more a ſoule then a beaſt) then he muſt be ſubiect. And this concluſion a learned man, that was
                     Aeneas Siluius in geſt. Concil. Baſilienſ. Chryſoſt. & Oecumen. in Rom. 13. 1. afterward a Pope himſelfe, made, when he plainly confeſſed, that the Apoſtle did not except animam Papae, the Popes ſoule from this ſubiection. I omit heere S. Chryſoſtomes and Oecumenius expoſition of the ſame place; both which affirme, that

by euery ſoule, the Apoſtle included both Prieſts, Monks, and Apoſtles, and that this ſubiection was not contrary vnto

               77. Secondly, they diſtinguiſh vpon that place of Iohn, where our Sauiour confeſſeth himſelfe to be vnder the power of Pilate, to be iudged by him, and ſay, that eyther it is to bee vnderſtood of a permiſſiue power graunted by God, without the which, no not ſinnes can be committed: with Cyrill and Chryſoſtome: or, if of the power of iuriſdiction, with Auguſtins and Bernard, that then Pilate had power ouer Chriſt, not ſimply, but by accident: to wit, as he was reputed to bee a priuate Iew, and ſo no more then a meere man: by which ignorance of the perſon, his power was iuſtified to be lawfull: as if a Ciuill Magiſtrate ſhould condemne a Clerke in the habite of a Lay man, not knowing him to be a Clerke, he ſhould be free from blame. To which I anſwere: Firſt, that the power of the Emperour, though a heathen, was lawfull, and ordayned by God, as they themſelues confeſſe▪ and as the Scriptures in many places prooue: but Pilates
                  Mat. 22. power was from the Emperour, therefore it was a lawfull, & not a lawleſſe power; and ſo not only by permiſſion, but alſo by ordination. Secondly, if it were onely a power by permiſſion, then Pilate had ſinned in executing that power vpon Chriſt: but becauſe of the miſtaking of the perſon, therefore hee ſaith, he was free from fault: as a Ciuill Magiſtrate, that ſhould iudge a Clerke, taking him for a Lay man. And ſo one part of his anſwere croſſeth the other. Laſtly, I anſwere, that though Pilate might erre in the perſon of Chriſt, yet Chriſt could not erre in the power of Pilate, who affirmeth of it plainely, that it was of God; and ſo it was indeede, in reſpect of the power it ſelfe, though the abuſe of it, in the condemning of an Innocent, was a ſinne: and ſo from the Diuell, and not from God.
               78. The Goſpell teacheth, that before regeneration wee14. Epheſ. 2. 1. Rom. 6. 13. Luk. 15. 31. & 9. 60. are dead in ſinne, and haue no more power to mooue in any worke of grace, then a dead carkaſſe hath in the works of

nature: and therefore can neither will nor doe that which is good. But the Church of Rome teacheth, that a man vnregenerateConcil. Trident. Seſſ. 6. cap. 1. can. 6. Bell. de grat. & lib. arbit. cap. 10. Salmer. tom. 13. pag. 32. & 38. Coſter. Enchirid. pag. 204. Ecchius, Enchir. Molyn. diſp. 12. is not ſpiritually dead, but wounded, like the man that fell among theeues betwixt Ierico and Ieruſalem: or, like a Priſoner with ſetters on his heeles: or, like a Bird entangled in a lime-buſh: and therefore that there is remayning in him ſo much power, both in his will and vnderſtanding, that being but helped a little by grace, hee can begin his conuerſion, and ſo deſerue a more plentifull grace of iuſtification. All this they affirme: then which, what can bee more contrary to the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt, which ſaith, that wee are ſtarke dead in ſinne, and are not able to thinke a good thought of our ſelues: but that all our ſufficiency is in God, and that he worketh in vs both the will and the deed, &c?
               79. Bellarmine heere likewiſe endeuoureth to eſcape byBell. de grat. & lib. arbit. l. 6. c. 13. a double diſtinction: Firſt, he ſaith, that a ſinner, becauſe he is ſpiritually dead, cannot of himſelfe, or by his owne power, recouer life, or prepare himſelfe thereunto: but yet being preuented and helped by grace, he may cooperate with God that quickneth him: for that he doth not, as being dead, but as hauing a vitall vertue inſpired into him by God.
               80. For anſwere whereunto, let me propound vnto him this queſtion, namely, Whether this ſpirituall life, which is the firſt degree of a ſinners conuerſion, bee inſpired into him altogether by the Spirit of God, without the helpe of his owne will? or whether it ariſeth partly from grace, and partly from his will. If he ſaith, Altogether from the Spirit, without the helpe of his will: then how doth the ſinner cooperate with God in his firſt conuerſion? If he ſay, Partly from grace, and partly from free-will: then how is the ſinner dead, when yet he doth worke towards the obtayning of his owne life? Can a dead man cooperate at all, much more towards his owne life? I, but hee is preuented and excited to grace, and ſo doth worke: but then I would know, whether in that firſt exciting and ſtirring vp, hee doth worke with Gods Spirit? whether he be actiue in that firſt motion, or paſſiue onely? If actiue, then hee is not dead: if paſſiue, then the firſt

degree of his conuerſion and ſpirituall life is only from grace, without the coadiution of this free-will: for this excitation and ſtirring vp of his will, is the firſt ſparke of ſpirituall life in a ſinner; and this is that which S. Auguſtine affirmeth, ſaying,Aug. de grat. & lib. arbiter. c. 17. 
                  that God without vs worketh in vs to will, (that is the firſt ſparke of life:) then worketh with vs, and helpeth vs when we doe will, (this is the ſecond.) And againe, The will is firſt changed from
                  Idem. cap. 20. Idem. Enchirid. cap. 32. 
                  euill to good, and helped when it is good. And againe, He prepareth the good will that is to be helped; and helpeth it when it is prepared. In all which paſſages, the firſt conuerſion of a ſinner is aſcribed to God alone, and mans will is a dead thing that mooueth not: but the ſucceeding works are attributed ioyntly to God and vs. And this is the very doctrine of the Goſpell: which Bellarmine plainely croſſeth by his diſtinction, though ſubtilly hee ſeemeth to doe nothing leſſe: for he ſaith plainely in another place, that in the act of our conuerſion,
                  Bell. de grat. & lib. arbit. lib. 6. cap. 15. & lib. 4. cap. 16. Alex. part. 3. m. 1. art. 2. ad. 1. 
                  will is truely free, and determineth it ſelfe, though God moue and apply it to the worke. And another compareth the will to an eye in a darkeplace, which though it ſee not, yet can ſee as ſoone as light commeth, becauſe in it ſelfe it hath the faculty of ſeeing: then which, what can bee more contrary to the Goſpell? the one affirming, that a ſinner is dead before his regeneration: the other, that he is but halfe dead, and wounded, and hath ſome power, and therefore life in himſelfe to grace and rghteouſnes.
               81. Bellarmine perceiuing the weaknes of this diſtinction, flyeth for ſuccour to another: and that is, though a ſinner be dead to grace, yet hee is aliue to nature; and ſo is not altogether dead: and that by the power of that naturall life, hee being helped by grace, can cooperate with God in his conuerſion: and therefore that the ſimilitude of a dead man doth not in euery reſpect agree vnto the vnregenerate; becauſe a dead man hath no life in him at all; but a man vnregenerate hath notwithſtanding the life of nature in him. But this is more abſurd then the former: for, firſt it is plaine, that the vnregenerate are as dead in reſpect of grace, as a dead carkaſſe is in reſpect of nature: for they haue no more ability

to the workes of grace, then a dead man to the workes of nature. A dead man hath no appetite or deſire to naturall things: no more hath the vnregenerate to ſpirituall things. A dead man hath no vnderſtanding of the things of this world: no more hath the vnregenerate of the things that are of God. A dead man cannot moue the members of the body, nor vſe the naturall ſaculties of the ſoule: no more can the vnregenerate mooue one haire bredth to Heauen-ward, nor vſe any graces of the Spirit. A dead man hath no ſenſe, nor feeling, though hee bee neuer ſo ſharply handled, ſeeth not, though the Sunne ſhineth neuer ſo bright, heareth not, though a trumpet be ſounded in his eare: no more can the vnregenerat feele the wounds of Gods Lawes, heare the ſound of the Goſpell, nor ſee the cleare light of truth that ſhinethround about him. Laſtly, in a dead man, there is a ſeparation of the ſoule frō the body: ſo, in the vnregenerate, there is a ſeparation of Gods Spirit from the ſoule, which is the ſoule of the ſoule. For this cauſe S. Aug. likened the vnregenerate man, to the ShunamitesAug. de verbis Apoſtol. ſer. 11. ſonne, beeing dead, whom the Prophet Elizeus raiſed from death, to life; and others, to Lazarus ſtinking in the graue, or, to the widowes ſonne of Nai
                        ••
                     , lying dead; vpon the beare; or, to Iairus daughter, that was dead in the houſe: noting three degrees of ſinnes, one more notorious then the other, yet all in the ſtate of death, vntill Chriſt by his Spirit ſhall inſpire life into them: and this is the perfect analogy and proportion, betwixt a dead man, and a ſinner: and therefore Bellarmines exception is falſe, that they doe not agree in all things: for there is nothing, wherein they doe agree, not, if the compariſon bee rightly proportioned.
               82. Secondly, if they did diſagree in other things, yet in this, wherein lyeth the life of the ſimilitude, they muſt needs agree, that as a dead man hath nothing, whereby he can helpe himſelfe, for the recouery of his life: ſo man ſpiritually dead, hath nothing in him, no faculty, or power of the ſoule, whereby he can any way further the obtaining of his cōuerſiō. And this was Saint Auguſtines opinion, agreeable to the Goſpell:Aug. de grat. & lib. arbit. cap. 5. for his words are plaine, concerning Pauls conuerſion, that he

was called from Heauen, and by that mighty and effectuall calling conuerted. Gratia Deiſolaerat: It was onely the grace of God. And no otherwiſe did Iuſtine Martyr conceiueIuſtin. Martyr. Apolog. 2. thereof, when hee ſayth, That as to haue beeing at the firſt, when wee are created, was not of our ſelues: ſo to chooſe and follow that which is pleaſing to God, is (not by vs) but by his perſwading, and mouing vs to the faith. In this therefore, which is the point of the queſtion, the ſimilitude holds moſt ſtrongly, and ſo Bellarmines exception is nothing to the purpoſe.
               83. Thirdly, and laſtly, it is moſt abſurd of all, which hee ſayth, that becauſe a ſinner liueth naturally, therefore he moueth towards grace, more then a dead carkas to nature, which hath no life at all: for in reſpect of grace, it is all one to haue no life at all; and to haue no life of the Spirit. For nothing can worke aboue the compaſſe of it owne beeing. Naturall life cannot tranicend the Spheare of nature, nor any way moue to the Spheare of grace. For as Plants that liue the vegetatiue life, cannot ariſe to the ſenſitiue life, which is in beaſts, nor they to the rationall, which is in men: So neither can theſe ariſe vp any whit to the life of the Spirit, which is in Gods Saints, till a new life bee inſpired into them: which new life, as it is the conuerſion of the ſoule to God, ſo it is the foundation of all ſpirituall actions, ſeeing life in euery kinde is the foundation of all the actions in that kind. For vntill there bee life in a plant, it doth not grow, vntill it bee in a beaſt, it doth not moue nor feele, vntill in a man, hee doth not thinke, ſpeake, or remember; and ſo vntill this life of the Spirit bee in the ſoule, it cannot will, nor worke any thing that is good. Therefore I conclude, that though a ſinner liue naturally, yet beeing dead to grace, that that life doth no more helpe to his conuerſion, then the ſenſitiue life of a beaſt doth to the obtaining of reaſon, or the vegetatiue15 Ioh. 5. 39. Col. 3. 16. 1. Pet. 3. 15. 1. Ioh. 2. 12. 13. 14. Luk. 16. 19. life of a Plant to the obtaining of ſenſe.
               84. The Goſpell teacheth, that all ſhould read the Scriptures, for ſo our Sauiour chargeth; and his Apoſtles Paul and Peter, and Iohn, charge not Prieſts onely, but all others. And Abraham ſendeth the rich Gluttons brethren to Moſes, and

the Prophets. And the Eunuch is not rebuked, but approuedActs. 8 28. Acts 17. 11. by Philip, for reading the Propheſie of Eſay. And the Bereans are commended for examining Pauls doctrine by the Scripture: which ſhould neuer haue beene, if it had not beene lawfull for them to doe it. This is the doctrine of the Goſpell,Bell. de verbo Det. lib. 2. cap. 15 Azorius Inſtit. moral. l. 8. c. 26. Concil. Trident. Regul. 4. Iud. librer. Coſter. Enchirid. moſt plaine and euident. But the Church of Rome teacheth, that all men muſt not read the Scripture, to wit, Laymen, except they bee permitted by their Ordinary, becauſe pearles are not to bee caſt amongſt ſwine: nor a ſword, or a knife put into a childes hand; nor occaſion of errour offered to the ignorant, nor matter of offence to the weake: as alſo, becauſe they are more obſcure then can bee vnderſtood of the Laicks, and common ſort of people. Thus they paint ouer the foule wrinkled face of Iezabel, with falſe colours: but yet the contrariety is plaine. All ought to read the Scriptures: and ſome ought not to read the Scriptures. The one is the doctrine of Ieſus Chriſt: The other, of the Pope and his Church.
               85. But Bellarmine diſtinguiſheth two wayes. Firſt, that there is a double way of knowing the Scriptures; one by hearing, and another by reading. The firſt is commanded to all, and therefore neceſſary to be vſed of all. But this laſt is not commanded to any, but to the Clergie, and thoſe whom they ſhall thinke fit to read them with profit, and without danger. But who ſeeth not, that when our Sauiour willeth to ſearch the Scriptures, hee ſpeaketh of reading? And when the Bereans examined Pauls ſermon by the Scriptures, they did it by reading. And when Abraham remitteth Diues brethren to Moſes, and the Prophets, hee ſendeth them to reading. For Moſes, and the Prophets were dead in their perſons, and liued onely in their writings. And laſtly, when the Apoſtles wrote their Epiſtles to the ſeuerall Churches, they wrote them to this end, that they might bee read of all. For ſo Saint Paul chargeth the Coloſſians, after they had read the Epiſtle, that they themſelues would cauſe it alſo to bee read in the Church of the Laodiceans. Beſides, if it bee a dangerous thing for the ignorant to read the Scriptures, for feare they ſhould peruert the ſenſe, & ſo fal into hereſie, or impiety; then

much more dangerous is the hearing of it, ſeeing there is no preaching ſo pure as the word it ſelfe; man euer mixing ſome dregs of his own corruption, with the pure wine of the word; nor any preacher ſo ſincere, but he doth often erre: and ſo the hearer being debarred from trying his doctrine by the touchſtone of the Scripture, muſt needs irrecouerably fall into errour.
               86. Secondly, hee ſayth that there are two kindes of Readers.Bell. quo ſupra. One that read with fruit and profit; others that read without fruit, yea rather with hurt. Now the Scripture may bee read of the firſt, but not of the ſecond. But I would know of him againe, who hath that power to diſcerne betwixt theſe two. Doe they know the heart of a man? Or, can they prophecy of that which is to come? If they cannot doe theſe things, then they ought not to locke vp the Scriptures from any, vpon this ſurmiſe; but permit the vſe of that which is good to all, and leaue the ſucceſſe to God. Againe, becauſe ſome peruert the Scripture to their damnation, ſhall therefore all bee forbidden to reape comfort by it? Becauſe the theefe robs, and kils with his ſword, ſhall not therefore an honeſt man vſe one for his owne defence? Becauſe the Spider ſucks vp poyſon out of the flowre, therefore ſhall not the Bee ſuck honey? This is to take away the vſe of all good things. For as the Poet ſayth, Nil prodeſt quod non laedere poſſit idem: NothingOuid. de triſt. lib. 2. ſo profitable in the vſe, but in the abuſe may be hurtfull and nuiſant.
               87. Laſtly, are the ignorant common people more ſubiectEſpe.ſ. us com. in tit. c. 1. & 2. to erring and hereſie, then the learned? Let Eſpenſaeus, a learned Biſhop of their owne, informe him to the contrary. I remember (ſayth hee) that an Italian Biſhop told me, that his countrey-men were ſcarred from reading the Scriptures, leſt they ſhould become heretikes: as if hereſies did ſpring from the ſtudy of the Scriptures, and not rather from the neglect and ignorance of them. And if he will not beleeue him, let anotherAlphouſ. de caſt. haereſ. l. 1. cap. 13 Maldon. in Euangel. learned Roman ſi ſtep out & tel him, that very few ignorāt perſons were the authors of hereſie: & another, that learned men, & indued with great wits, fall by their pride into hereſie: ſo that he

need not ſo much feare, leſt hereſie ſhould build her neſt in the boſome of the poore ignorant man, as leſt like the Eagle ſhee ſhould flye aloft, and ſet her ſelfe in the top of the high Cedars of the Church.
               88. But what doe I ſtand to ouerthrow this vaine exception, ſince it is no better then a meere deception, confuted by the practice of their owne Church? for without difference, any that will pay for it, beeing neuer ſo ignorant, might haue a licence to read the Scriptures. And we had heere in England in Queene Maries dayes, a Romiſh indulgence, that hee that
                     Cartwrights anſwere to the Preface of the Rhemes Teſtament. could diſpend a certaine reuenue by the yeere, might read the Bible in Engliſh, as is reported by Maſter Cartwright, in his anſwere to the Preface of the Rhemes Teſtament. So that is as cleare as the day, that it is not the fruit and benefit that ſhould come to the Reader, that they regarded, but the profit and gaine that ſhould accrue to their owne purſes: neither was the feare of erring the cauſe of their prohibition: but rather the feare of too much knowledge, leſt thereby the groſſe and foule abominations of their Church ſhould bee diſcouered and ſo come to bee abhorred and deteſted.
               89. The Goſpell teacheth, that none can forgiue ſins, but16 Eſay 43. 25. luk. 5. 21. God: becauſe ſinne is a preuarication of Gods Law; and therefore none can remit it, but hee againſt whom it is committed. Vpon which ground venerable Bede writing vponBeda in Luk. 5. theſe words of the fift of Luke, Who can forgiue ſinnes, but God? ſayth, that the Phariſes ſaid truely therein: becauſe no man can forgiue ſinnes, ſaue God alone: who alſo forgiueth by them to whom hee hath committed the power of the keyes: and therefore Chriſt is proued to bee truely God by this, that hee can forgiue ſinnes, as God: and it may be proued further to bee true, becauſe our Sauiour himſelfe approoueth of that ſpeech of theirs, not ſhewing any manner of diſlike thereunto. And therefore Saint Ambroſe affirmeth plainely, that to
                  Ambroſ. epiſt. 16. 
                  forgiue ſinnes, is not common to any man with Chriſt. This is (ſayth he) the onely office of Chriſt, who tooke away the ſinne of the world. And Cyprian as directly; Onely the Lord can take

By which wee ſee, that according to their doctrine, the Pope hath aſmuch power to forgiue ſins, as Chriſt himſelfe hath: which iſ the Scribes and Phariſes liued and heard, they would cry out, O blaſphemie. This is the expreſſe doctrine of the Church of Rome.
               
               90. For the making good of this doctrine, they haue a double diſtinction, anſwerable to the double manner of remitting ſin, vſed in their Church; one touching the abſolution of a ſinner, by the Prieſt, in their Sacrament of penance. The other, touching the Popes indulgence, out of the Sacramēt, groūded vpon the treaſure of ſupererogatory works, which they ſay, is in the Church, and conſequently, in the Popes diſpenſation. Concerning the firſt (they ſay) that Chriſt abſolueth a ſinner by his owne power; but the Prieſt, by the power of Chriſt, committed vnto him in that famous Legacy, Whoſe ſinnes yee remit on earth, they are remitted in Heauen.

                   cōtradict their ancient ſchoole. For Peter Lumbard, one of the maſters of the ſchoole, doth plainly affirme, that ſuch only are worthily abſolued by the Church, who are abſolued in Heauen: becauſe by the error of man, it may ſo happen, that hee that ſeemeth to bee caſt out of Gods family▪ bee ſtill within;

and he who may be thoght to remaine within, is notwithſtanding caſt ou
                     •
                  . And that therefore God abſolueth differently from the Church; God by remitting the ſinne, & purging the ſoule from the blemiſh thereof, and freeing it from eternall puniſhment; the Church by declaring who are abſolued by God. By which not onely his opinion is manifeſt, that the Prieſt hath no abſolute power of abſoluing a ſinner, but onely of declaring that hee is abſolued, which is our doctrine: but alſo his reaſon is inuincible, that becauſe the Prieſt may erre in his abſolution; therefore hee hath no ſuch abſolute power committed vnto him. And that wee may not thinke that this Maſter of theirs is without ſchollers, the gloſſe of their decrees doth ſet down aſmuch, when it ſayth, Dimi

Which, becauſe it ſpeakes too boldly; therefore their iudicious Cenſurers haue cauſed it either to bee blotted out, or compelled it to ſpeakeIndex. expurg. Belg. edit. Greg. otherwiſe.
               92. Secondly, I anſwere, that this doctrine is croſſed by it ſelfe. For they do not profeſſe any other abſolution, but ſuch as may be hindered by the party to by abſolued, to wit, if by want of faith, or repentance, he put an inuiſible bar to ſtop the power thereof. Now, if the ſinner may hinder his own abſolutiō, then the Prieſt hath no power to abſolue him, except he be fitly diſpoſed for the receiuing of it; & this diſpoſition is meerly from God: and therefore in God is the onely power to abſolue; and in the Prieſt, onely to declare who is abſolued, and that conditionally, if h
                     •
                   be thus qualified, and haue no barre to hinder. For if the power of abſoluing, or not abſoluing, depend vpon the putting in, or taking away the barre of impenitency; then he onely can iudicially abſolue a ſinner, that can giue him repentance: but neyther the Pope, nor any mortall man is able to doe this, as the Scripture teſtifieth in many places: and therefore neyther Pope nor Prieſt can abſolue a ſinner any further then by a declaratiue ſentence.
               93. Laſtly, it croſſeth their owne practice: for they teach, that dead m

                  n, dying in excommunication, may be abſolued:

and they practiſe the ſame, to wit, as Bellarmine ſaith, when

                  l hold no water. Let vs heare the ſecond. Touching the Popes power to pardon out of the Sacrament, this it is: They ſay, that the Pope doth not by his pardon take vpon him, eyther to remit the guilt ofBell.

                  e: for guilt and puniſhment are vnſeparable companions; inſomuch, as in the Hebrew tongue, Sinne and Puniſhment are notified by one and the ſame word, to ſhew, that where the one is, there the other is alſo: and therefore he that can pardon the ore, may alſo releaſe the other. Adde hereunto, that to pardon a ſinne, is nothing elſe (as our common phraſe of ſpeech, together with reaſon, teacheth vs) but to remit the puniſhment thereof: as when the King, in the Court of Iuſtice, pardoneth a Malefactor, he releaſeth him from the puniſhment which by the law he ſhould ſuffer: ſo in the Court of Conſcience, he that doth remit any part of the puniſhment due by Gods Law vnto a ſinner, (as the Pope doth vndertake to doe) by the ſame labour doth remit ſo much of the guilt it ſelfe. And ſo this diſtinction filleth to the ground, being as feeble and brittle as the former.
               95. Laſtly, the Goſpell teacheth, that when we haue done all that we can, yet we may ſay, that we are vnprofitable ſeruants, Luke 17. 10. But the Church of Rome teacheth, that

And Saint Ambroſe his meaning is nothing elſe but this, that

               97. Secondly, he anſwereth, that we are vnprofitable indeede; but to God, not to our ſelues, which hee ſaith, is Beda's interpretation: but hee leaueth out that which followeth in Beda: for ſo farre is hee from building hereupon theBeda in Luc. cap. 17. merite of works, that he ſaith plainely, that by whoſe mercy we are preuented, that we may humbly ſerue him; by his gift wee are crowned to raigne with him. By which it is euident, that if wee b
                     •
                   profitable to our ſelues, it is becauſe God accepteth our ſeruice, and in mercy rewardeth the ſame; not becauſe we deſerue any thing at his hands. To omit that the word Seruants hath relation to Maſters, and not to themſelues: and therfore in ſaying they are vnprofitable ſeruants, it muſt needs be vnderſtood in reſpect of God, and not of themſelues.
               98. Thirdly, hee anſwereth out of Saint Auguſtine, that we are ſaid to bee vnprofitable in reſpect of the couenant of the law: but in reſpct of the free couenant of grace, we may be profitable, and more then profitable. But this is Bellarmines fraudulent collection, and not Saint Auguſtines intention: for he ſaith onely, that we can require no reward for our labour, though
                  
                     Aug. ſer. 3. de verb. Dom.
                   
                  we haue kept all the commandements, vnleſſe God of his free grace had couenanted with vs to reward vs. He ſaith not that wee are made profitable by grace, eyther to God our Maſter, or to our ſelues. And therefore in another place he diſclaimeth vtterly all profite and merite in our ſelues, when he ſaith, Lord,
                  Aug. in Pſal. 142.
                  
                  for thy Names ſake quicken me, in thy righteouſnes, not in mine; not becauſe I haue deſerued it, but becauſe thou art mercifull. Thus this generation is not aſhamed to wreſt and wring the godly Fathers, to make them ſpeake to their purpoſe.
               99. Laſtly, hee anſwereth out of Saint Chryſoſtome, that our Sauiour ſaith not, Yee are vnprofitable ſeruants; but bids them ſay ſo of themſelues, to teach them humility, and to auoyd pride. But how doe this follow, that becauſe Chriſt biddeth vs to ſay ſo, to auoyd pride, therefore we are not ſo? yea, rather therefore we are ſo: for would he bid vs to lye? Chryſoſtome himſelfe in another place cleereth this doubt, whenChryſoſt. ad pop. Antioch. hom. 53 he ſaith, that all that euer wee doe, we doe vpon dutie: for which cauſe Chriſt ſayd, When yee haue done all, ſay, yee are vnprofitable ſeruants: So that Chryſoſtome did not onely thinke it fit for vs to ſay ſo for humility ſake, but alſo that wee were ſo in truth and indeede. Let Saint Bernard, for an vpſhot, wipe awayBernard. de tripl. cuſtod. this diſtinction: Wilt thou (ſaith he) ſay, that Chriſt hath taught thee to ſay ſo for humility ſake? true, indeed it was for humility; but what, againſt truth? And thus none of theſe ſhifts and diſtinctions can deliuer this doctrine from oppoſition to the Goſpell: for it followeth ineuitably, if the beſt be no better then vnprofitable ſeruants, then none can worke ſuch works, whereby hee may not onely merite for himſelfe eternall life, but hauing a ſurpluſage of redundant merits, beſtow ſome of them for the ſupplying of others wants.
               100. And thus wee haue a ſhort view of the cleere and manifeſt oppoſitions that are betwixt the doctrines of the Goſpell, and the doctrines of the Church of Rome. And we ſee with what ſubtill and intricate diſtinctions, they labour to reconcile them together: but truth is naked, and needeth no ſuch ſhiftings. Both the one and the other therefore, namely, their direct oppoſition to the Goſpell on the one ſide, and their elaborate diflinctions, to make good their cauſe on the other, doth euidently euince the concluſion of this ninth demonſtration, that that Religion, which is built vpon ſuch deſperate and dangerous principles, cannot be the truth of Chriſt, but the doctrine and Religion of Antichriſt.
            
            
               
               
                  The X. MOTIVE. That Religion which nouriſheth moſt barbarous and groſſe ignorance amongſt the people, and forbiddeth the knowledge and vnderſtanding of the grounds of the Chriſtian faith, cannot be the truth: but this doth the Romiſh Religion: ergo, &c.
               1. IN the firſt propoſition of this Argument, the RomaniſtsMaior. hold the Wolfe by the eares, not knowing whether it be better to graunt, or to deny it: for if they graunt it to bee true, it will flye in their faces, becauſe they are guilty of the contents thereof: and if they deny it, it will bite them by the fingers: for all men will condemne them of ſhameleſſe impudency, for denying ſo apparant a truth. Therefore as the beaſt, which Pliny calleth Amphiſbaena, ſo it ſtingeth both wayes. But of two euils the leſſer: they muſt of neceſſitie deny it, or elſe they muſt condemne their owne practice of impietie: which ſure they will not doe, though for their labour they gaine to themſelues that name, which ſo frequently and imperiouſly they impute vnto vs, Shameleſſe Heretikes: they ſpeake it of vs in the ſpirit of malice: but it ſhall be prooued of them by ſound reaſon, and that in this demonſtration enſuing, by Gods aſſiſtance.
               2. For the confirmation therefore of the firſt propoſition a word or two, though whatſoeuer can be ſpoken thereof, is but to adde light vnto the Sunne: Firſt therefore the Scripture ſtandeth foorth, and condemneth ignorance ſo plainely, that nothing can be more euident. Salomon telleth vs, That
                  Pro. 8. 35. 
                  they which hate knowledge, loue death. And the Prophet Eſay,
                  Eſay 5. 13. 
                  That the people were carryed into captiuitie, becauſe they had no knowledge. And the Prophet Hoſca, That they were deſtroyed
                  Hoſca 4. 6. 
                  for lacke of knowledge. Our Sauiour affirmeth, that the cauſe of erring in the Sadduces, was the ignorance of the Scripture.
                  Mat. 22. 29. And Saint Paul coupleth theſe two together in the Gentiles, Darkned cogitations through ignorance, and ſtrangers from the
                  Epheſ. 4. 18. 
                  life of God: where he plainely ſheweth, that ignorance and deſtruction

are inſeparable companions, as ſanctified knowledge and ſaluation are. And (to omit infinite other paſſages of holy writ) our Sauiour directly concludeth, that he which knoweth his Maſters will, and doth it not, ſhall bee beaten with
                  Ioh. 17. 
                  many ſtripes: and he which knoweth it not, and therefore doth it not, ſhall be beaten too, but with fewer ſtripes. By which he giueth vs to know, that though ſome kinde of ignorance may extenuate and leſſen the fault; yet none, eſpecially if it bee of matters which we are bound to know, and may be attayned vnto, doth excuſe from all fault, but is blame-worthy and puniſhable by Gods iuſtice.
               3. Thus ſpeakes the holy Ghoſt in the Scripture, and doubtles in reaſon it muſt needs be ſo; for wherin doth a man differ from a beaſt, but in reaſon and vnderſtanding? and wherein doth one man differ from another, but in the enlightning of reaſon by diuine knowledge, which is the matter ſubiect of true Religion? Religion being nothing elſe but the knowledge and profeſſion of the diuine truth: the want whereof muſt needs be a ſubuerter and deſtroyer thereof. A Phyſicion that is ignorant of the grounds of his Arte, we account a Mountebanke and Impoſter. And what, I pray you, can they be leſſe, that profeſſe ignorance, and that in the moſt difficult Art of all other, the Art of Chriſtianitie? Beſides, all confeſſe that ignorance is a defect and blemiſh of the ſoule, and that the more knowledge a man hath, the neerer he is vnto perfection, becauſe hee is the more like vnto God: but the chiefe end of Religion is to purge away the blemiſhes, & to make vp the breaches of the ſoule, & to renue Gods Image defaced therin, that ſo we may be made like vnto him, euen perfect, as he is perfect. How can then true Religion teach ignorance, which is ſuch an enemy vnto perfectiō? or how can that be true religion, which nouriſheth ignorance, & inioyneth it vnto moſt of her profeſſors & followers.
               4. Let the fathers bee Iudges of this cauſe. Saint Auguſtine
                  Aug. Epiſt. 119. ſayth in one place, that Ignorance, as a naughty mother, bringeth forth two wicked daughters, falſhood, and doubting. And in another, that the knowledge of God is the engine, by which the
                  
                  ſtructure of charity is built vp. Saint Bernard ſayth, that both
                  Bernard. in Cantic. 
                  the knowledge of God, and of a mans ſelfe, is neceſſary to ſaluation. For as out of the knowledge of a mans ſelfe, commeth the feare of God, and out of the knowledge of God, the loue of him: ſo on the contrary, from the ignorance of a mans ſelfe, commeth
                  Chryſoſt. in polit. lib. 3. 
                  pride, and from the ignorance of God desperation. Saint Chryſoſtome ſayth, that knowledge goeth before the imbracing of Vertue, becauſe no man can faithfully deſire that, which hee knoweth not, and euill vnknowne, is not feared. The like ſong ſing all the reſt of the Fathers, whoſe teſtimonies I thinke needleſſe to accumulate, being ſo wel knowne to all men.
               5. And that they may bee vtterly without excuſe, heare
                     Aquin. 12. q. 76. art 2. what their owne Doctours affirme. Aquinas confeſſeth, that omnis ignorantia vincibilis eſt peccatum, ſi ſit eorum, quae aliquis ſeire tenetur. All vincible ignorance (that is, which may bee auoided) is ſinne, if it bee of thoſe things, which a man is bound to know. But ſuch is the ignorance maintained in the Church of Rome, not onely vincible, but affected, wilfull and voluntary. Bellarmine alſo acknowledgeth, that ignorance is a

                  diſeaſe and wound of the ſoule, brought in as a puniſhment of originall ſinne: And confeſſeth out of Saint Auguſtine, that it is the cauſe of errour. For, Two euils are brought into the world, (ſayth Saint Auguſtine) by originall ſinne: ignorance, and difficulty; from which, two other fountaines of euils doe ariſe, to wit, error, & griefe. For ignorance bringeth forth error; and difficulty, griefe. And our Countrey-man Stapleton telleth vs plainely,

                     , in quo quantò curris velociùs, tantò a via aberras longiùs, & peccas abſurdiùs. Zeale without knowledge, is a violent courſe in a wrong way, wherein the ſwifter wee runne, the further woe wander, and ſinne the groſlier. Thus they themſelues write, and therefore I wonder how the ſame men ſhould dare to allow that which in their own conſciences they condemne; or nouriſh that in the people, which they confeſſe to bee a ſinne, a wound, and diſeaſe of the ſoule, and the way to perdition. I know not how they will diſtinguiſh and ſhift off that ſayingRom. 14. 32. of Saint Paul: Bleſſed is he that condemneth not himſelfe, in

that which hee alloweth: vnleſſe it bee either by ſaying, that they condemne not ignorance in all, but onely in the Lay people: as if Lay people had not ſouls to ſaue aſwel as Prieſts: Or that they allow of it, not ſimply in regard of it ſelfe, but in reſpect to a further good, to wit, the increaſe of deuotion: as if euill were to be done, that good might come thereof; which Saint Paul giueth a God forbid vnto, and ſayth, that theirRom. 3. 8. damnation is iuſt, that are of that minde. I leaue therefore this firſt propoſition, confirmed by Scripture, reaſon, Fathers, and their owne Doctours, and come to the ſecond, wherein out of their owne grounds, they ſhall bee conuinced of this groſſe impiety.

How contrary is this to that which Saint Peter teacheth, that eueryman be ready to giue an anſwere of the hope that is in him? Hoſius ſaith, that to know nothing, is to know all things, and ignorance of moſt things, is beſt of all.

The ſame Hoſius, with Stephylus, and others, commends the Colliers faith to be the onely faith, whereby euery vnlearned man may trye the ſpirits, reſiſt the Deuill, iudge of the right ſenſe of Scriptures, and diſcerne true doctrine from falſe, &c. And what was the Colliers faith? Mary, being at the point of death, and tempted of the Deuill, anſwered, I beleeue and dye in the faith of Chriſts Church. Being againe demanded, what the faith of Chriſts Church was, anſwered, that faith that I hold. And thus hee beleeued as the Church beleeued, and the

Church as he, and yet he neither knew what the Church, nor himſelfe beleeued. This is a braue faith, and worthy to bee canonized to all poſterity, for conquering the Deuill. But what if the Deuill departed from the Collier, not becauſe hee was ſcarred with his bugbare faith, but becauſe he perceiued him ſafe enough intangled in his ſnare, and ſo needed not to tempt him any more, being already ſure enough his owne? Where was his faith then? Sure I am, it is farre vnlike to that faith which the Scripture ſpeaketh of, which is often called by the name of knowledge, and not of ignorance, as Eſay 53. 11. Iohn 17. 3.
               7. Againe, another affirmeth plainely, to wit, Linwood
                  Linwood in gloſ. in c. ignor. de ſum. trinitat. their Lawyer, that for ſimpler people it is ſufficient to beleeue the articles of the, faith implicuè: that is, confuſedly, and infoldedly, and not diſtinctly, and plainely: as a bottome of yarne folded together, which lieth in a ſmall compaſſe, and not raueled out at the length, that it may bee ſeene and diſcerned in euery part. And their Angelicall Doctour, Aquinas, compareth
                  Aquin. 2. 2. q. 2. art. 6. 
                  Gods children to aſſes, and their teachers to oxen (becauſe it is ſaid in the firſt Chapter of Iob, that the oxen did plow, and the aſſes fed by them) & that it is ſufficient for them in matters of faith to adhere vnto their ſuperiours. And in the ſame place, hee concludeth, that a man is bound to know no more explicitely, but the Aritcles of the faith. As for all other doctrines of Religion conteined in Scripture, it is enough to beleeue them implicitely. And againe in another place hee ſayth, thatIdem 2. 2. q. 82 art. 3 knowledge doth occaſionally hinder deuotion, and therfore, that ſimple men and women, that are voyd of knowledge, are for the moſt part moſt inclined to deuotion. But I confeſſe, he ſpeaketh this of ſuch knowledge as is not ſanct fied, but puffeth vp: how be it hee ſhould then haue aſcribed the impediment of deuotion, vnto the pride that accompanieth knowledge, and not to knowledge. Hence grew that notorious celebrated prouerbe of the Romiſh Synagogue, that Ignorance is the mother of deuotion. And it goeth for currant amongſt them all, as yet vncontrolled. But how oppoſite is the very ſound thereof, to that which holy Scripture teacheth, that ignorance is the
                  
                  mother of errour, and of folly, Prou. 7. 7. and of deſtruction,
                  Mat. 22. 37. 
                  Hoſ. 2. 6. Thus wee haue their open confeſſion: and what ſhould follow, but their open condemnation?
               8. But peraduenture the Iury requireth fuller euidence: let them liſt therefore to their doctrines: diuers whereof either directly maintaine ignorance, or at leaſt by neceſſary conſequence driue thereunto: and they are ſuch, as are not the particular opinions of priuate men, but the approoued doctrines of their Church; ſo that a man cannot bee an entyre Romaniſt, but he muſt needes ſubſcribe vnto them; and ſubſcribing vnto them, muſt alſo needs confeſſe, that that monſtrous ignorance which is in the Church of Rome, doth iſſue out of their corrupt fountaine. To come therefore vnto them.
               9. The firſt doctrine that breedeth and nouriſheth ignorance1. amongſt them, is their locking vp the Scripture in an vnknowne tongue, that the common people, being ignorant of the learned tongues, may not be able to read them, much leſſe to vnderſtand them to their comfort: which that is ſo, hath beene partly declared already, and may further bee demonſtrated: for Bellarmine affirmeth, that it is not neceſſary
                  Bell. de verbo Dei. lib. 2. cap. 15 
                  for the Scripture to be tranſlated into our Mother tongue. And Azorius, another Ieſuite, going a ſtep further, ſaith, that it is
                  Azor. Inſtit. moral. l. 8. c. 26. 
                  not expedient for the ſacred volumes to be tranſlated into Mother tongues, becauſe thereby the vnitie of the faithfull ſhould be detrimented, and diuers cauſes of errors and hereſies would ſpring vp. And Salmeron, a third Ieſuite, deſcending yet a ſtayreSalmer. com. in 1. Cor. 14. lower, ſaith, that the tranſlation of the Scripture ſhould be onely tillinguis, of three tongues, that is, Hebrew, Greeke, and Latine, in honour of the Trinitie. Or, as another ſaith, Becauſe th
                        •
                     ſe three tongues were onely ſanctified vpon the Croſſe. Herevpon the Councill of Trent decreeth, the olde vulgar Latine
                  Concil. Trident. Seſſ. 4. decret. 2. 
                  Tranſlation of the Bible to be onely authenticall, and alone to bee vſed in all publike Lectures, Diſputations, Preachings, and expoſitions. And though Pope Pius Quartus forbade onely (as Bellarmine ſaith) ſuch to read the Scripture, as had not licenceBell. de verbo Dei. lib. 2. c. 15. thereunto giuen them by their Prieſt or Confeſſor, to wit, ſuch as could receiue no damage, but profit by their reading:

yet Pope Clement the eighth, as another Ieſuite confeſſeth,Azor. Inſtit. moral. l. 8. c. 26. tooke away all faculty of giuing licence to any to read the Scripture, or to retaine with them the common Bibles, or any parts of the Old and New Teſtament in the Mother tongues: ſo that (as wofull experience hath taught) it was in times paſt in this Land, and is now in thoſe places where the bloudie Inquiſition is exerciſed, a ſufficient marke of an Heretike, and cauſe of fire and faggot, to bee found with a tranſlated Bible in their houſes or hands.
               10. This is their doctrine, which how it ingendreth and nouriſheth ignorance, who ſeeth not? ſeeing firſt it locks vp the fountayne of knowledge, that few or none of the common ſort can drinke of the waters thereof: cleane contrary to that famous ſaying of learned Origene, who comparethOrig. in Mat. 4. contra Celſum. the Scripture to Iacobs Well: where not onely Iacob and his Sonnes, that is, the Learned; but alſo the Cattell and the Sheepe, that is, the rude and the ignorant doe drinke and refreſh themſelues: but theſe men barre out the poore ſheepe, and driue them away from the waters of life, to no other end, as it may be thought, but that they ſhould pine away with thirſt, and liue and dye in blindneſſe and ignorance. For if all ſound and true knowledge is to be found in holy Scripture, and therein is the whole counſell and will of God reuealed vnto vs, ſo farre foorth as it concerneth our ſaluation, it being the Epiſtle
                  Greg. Epiſt. 84. 
                  of the great Iehouah to his poore Subiects, to enforme them of his will and pleaſure, how ſhould they poſſibly clime to this true and ſauing knowledge, who are debarred from the place and meanes where it is to found and had, and not permitted to reade this Letter, or heare it read vnto them? contrary to that doctrine of Nazianzene, who ſaith, that all Chriſtians
                  Nazianz. hom. 4. Dom. Epiphan. 
                  ought to come to Church, and there read themſelues, or if they be not able, heare others read vnto them the word of God.
               
               11. If they reply, and ſay, that it is enough for them to know the Traditions of the Church: I anſwere, that if there were as certaine ground for their Traditions, to prooue them the word of God, as there is of the Scripture, then this allegation might carry ſome ſhew of reaſon: but the vncertainty, nouelty,

mutability, and abſurdity of many of them, doe plainely ſhew, that it is no ſafe courſe to repoſe the ſtrength of our ſaluation vpon them, but rather to flye to that foundation which is immooueable. If they ſay, that the people muſt be content for their knowledge to depend vpon their Prieſts, and to draw it from their lippes, and ſo by that meanes may attayne a ſufficient meaſure of inſtruction: I anſwere, that the Prieſts are for the moſt part as ignorant as the people, as ſhall be ſhewed afterward: and if any be furniſhed with gifts, yet they ſeldome teach the people; and when they doe, they preach, in ſtead of Gods word, their owne inuentions, idle tales, and meere tales, and fables: witneſſe Cornelius Agrippa,
                  Agrip. de vanit. cap. Theolog. Dante. canto. 29. and Dante their Poet, two no great enemies, but faſt friends to Popiſh Religion. Now if a man ſhould bee conſtrained to ſup vp whatſoeuer euery ſottiſh Prieſt, or idle Fryer, or craftie Ieſuite doth belch foorth, without examining, doubtleſſe hee ſhould ſucke downe much poyſon, in ſtead of wholſome iuyce. If they ſay, that there is multiplicity of good Bookes written to this end, to inſtruct the people in the grounds of Religion, and to ſtirre them vp vnto godlines and deuotion: I anſwere, there is indeede a great number of ſuch Bookes, which are ſo farre from gendring ſound knowledge, that they are no better then baits of Antichriſt, ſeruing to allure men, vnder ſhew of deuotion, vnto Idolatry, and Apoſtacie from God: for if they were ſound and true, why ſhould Gods Booke, which without all queſtion is moſt ſound, bee prohibited, and they admitted? Why is it not lawfull to examine them by that rule? and why ſhould all Bookes elſe, which any thing make againſt their Religion, be ſuppreſſed? and by great penalties forbidden? Surely this ſheweth, that all their Bookes of deuotion are but rotten ſtuffe, and meere hypocriticall deuices to deceiue the ſimple.
               12. Laſtly, if they ſay, that all our tranſlations are falſe and erronious; and therefore that our Bibles are not the word of God: I anſwere, that indeede it is impoſſible to haue a Tranſlation ſo exact & perfect, that no fault nor imperfection ſhuld be found therin: neuertheles, the chief faults in our tranſlations

are, for the moſt part, in reſpect of proprietie of words and phraſes, which are nothing repugnant to holy doctrine or good life, and not in any materiall or ſubſtantiall poynt of faith: and thoſe alſo are not frequent▪ but heere and there diſperſed, which can no waies hinder the profite to be gathered by the reſt of the Scripture: and if for ſome corruption in tranſlations the Bible ſhould not bee read, then none but the originall Hebrew and Greeke ſhould bee in vſe; for all tranſlations are imperfect: yea, their ſo much extolled vulgar, authorized by the Councill of Trent, wherein the DiuinesFran. Luc. praefat. in annot. in bibl. Amand. Polan. in Didaſcal. pag. 4. of Louane obſerued many errors: and Iſidorus Clarius, a Spaniſh Monke, profeſſed that hee found eight thouſand fau'ts, though for his plaine dealing hee was plagued by the Inquiſitors: and after that it was decreed authenticall by the Councill, (a thing worth the noting) yet it was corrected and caſtigated, by the authority and commaundement of ſixe Popes ſucceſſiuely. Nay, the Hebrew and Greeke copies themſelues ſhould not bee permitted; for euen they, if wee will beleeue the Romaniſts, are full of corruptions: but asBell▪ de verb

               13. Moreouer, beſides all this, it is no maruell if they contend for their vulgar Latine Bible, that it ſhould be onely authenticall, ſeeing many Romiſh errors are thereby maintained, which in the truth of ye

                   originall haue no colour of defence. And ſo this doctrine doth not onely vphold ignorance in the ſimple, but alſo herefie among the learned. As for example, to prooue the interceſſion and patronage of the Virgine Mary, they alledge that text of Geneſis, falſely tranſlated,Gen. 3. 15. 
                  Ipſa conteret caput Serpentis: She ſhall bruiſe the Serpents head: whereas the Hebrew truth hath moſt euidently, He, or It, meaning the Seede of the woman, and not Shee. Againe, to prooue their Maſſe Sacrifice, they alledge that of

                  Gen. 14. 18. Melchizedek obtulit panem & vinum: erat enim
                  Gen. 14. 18. Obtulit. Protulit.
                   
                  ſacerdos: whereas in the Hebrew text is no word that ſignifieth, to offer: but to bring foorth; and the coniunction cauſall is alſo wanting. They extenuate originall ſinne by the corrupt tranſlation of that text, Gen. 8. 21. For whereas in theGen. 8. 21. originall it is, Figmentum cordis eſt tantum malum: The frame of the heart is onely euill: their tranſlation hath, The cogitation of mans heart is prore vnto euill. To prooue their inuocation of Saints, they obiect that of Iobs, thus tranſlated, Ad aliquem Sanctorum conuertere: which in the Hebrew isIob. 5. 1. not an affirmatiue propoſition, but an Ironical Interrogation: thus: To which of the Saint▪ wilt thou turne? To proue that no man can be ſure of the remiſſion of his ſinnes and ſaluation, they alledge that corrupted text, Eccleſ. 9. 1. Neſcit homo
                  Eccleſ. 9. 1. 
                  vtrum amore vel odio dignus ſit: whereas in the originall, it is nothing but thus, No man knoweth loue or hatred, all things are before him. That their Church cannot erre, they labour to prooue by the promiſe of our Sauiour, Ioh. 14. 26. whereIoh. 14. 26. their tranſlation thus ſpeaketh, Spiritus ſanctus ſuggeret vobis omnia quae

That Matrimony is a Sacrament, they prooue by that place, Epheſ. 5. 32. where their tranſlation hath, a Sacrament, forEpheſ. 5. 32. a Myſterie. So for their Merite of works, they produce, Heb. 13. where, in their tranſlation, the word Merite is vſed, whichHeb. 13. is not extant in the Greeke. So to prooue, that after Baptiſme there remaine no Relikes of ſinne, they vſe that text, Heb. 9.Heb. 9. 28. 28. Chriſtus ſemel oblatus eſt ad multorum exhaurienda peccata: now where all is drawne out, there nothing remaineth: and yet in the originall there is no ſuch word. Laſtly, the Councill of Trent it ſelfe, to prooue that the Church may diſpenſe with the Sacraments, contrary to Chriſts inſtitution, and alter them, abuſeth that text, 1. Cor. 4. 1. where the

                   importeth no ſuch matter. Thus wee

                  ee great cauſe why they ſhould ſtand vpon this vulgar Latine onely, becauſe it affoords vnto them ſuch pregnant

proofes for the defence of their groſſe errors. It defends them and their errors, therefore they haue reaſon to defend it. And thus by forbidding the Scriptures to bee read of the people, they multiply ignorance; and by allowing onely their Latine tranſlation for authenticall, they hatch hereſie.
               14. Secondly, their doctrine which commandeth Prayers2. to be made publikely and priuately in an vnknowne tongue, tendeth to the ſame end: for though, touching priuate prayers, they agree not amongſt themſelues; ſome affirming, that the people ought not to ſay their Pater noſter, A

                  and Mattens in any tongue but the Latine, becauſe this hath beene the ancient cuſtome of the Church, as they pretend. Others, that it is lawfull to pray in our natiue tongues: but yet if we doe pray in Latine, it is not vnfruitfull. Notwithſtanding, their continuall practice ſheweth their moſt approoued opinion: for among them all, you ſhall hardly finde one in an age that vſeth any other but Latine prayers: but as for publike prayers in the Church, it is the doctrine of the Councill of Trent, armed with a curſe, that no part of the Diuine Seruice and publike Leiturgie bee celebrated in aConcil. Trident. Seſſ. 22. c. 8. & 9. Bell. de verb. De
                        •
                     . lib. 2. cap. 16 knowne tongue. Now how can this but noozle the people in ignorance, when they are taught to babble out in their deuotions, like Parrats, without vnderſtanding what they ſay? Surely this muſt needes bee a blinde deuotion, and an ignorantzeale, when the tongue ſhall pray, or rather prate, and the heart not vnderſtand what it vttereth: for if true deuotion be a religious offering vp of the whole man, both body and ſoule, and euery facultie and part of both to God, by way of ſpirituall ſacrifice; then certainely that cannot bee true deuotion, but blinde deluſion, when the affection and the tongue ſhall bee lifted vp in prayer, and in the meane while the vnderſtanding ſhall be idle, not knowing what the affection and tongue doth: ſeeing the proper worke of the intellectiue part of the ſoule is to know and vnderſtand, which by this meanes it is depriued of. And this is that which both Aquinas, their Angelicall Doctor, purpoſely confeſſeth, and Rabbi Bellarmine alſo himſelfe, though vnawares: for the

one ſaith, that he which vnderſtandeth not what he prayeth, is depriued
                  
                     Aquin. com. in 1. Cor. 14. Bell. de verb. Dei. lib. 2. cap. 16 
                  of the fruit of his deuotion: and the other, that except the prayer be vnderſtood, no conſolation at all can be reaped thereby. Ignorance therefore muſt needes bee cheriſhed by this doctrine, ſeeing the vnderſtanding, which is the ſeat of knowledge, is muffled, and the beſt fruit that can ariſe hencefrom, is blinde zeale, and ignorant deuotion: by which theAct. 3. 17. Rom. 11. 2. Ioh. 16. 2. Iewes crucified Chriſt, & the Gentiles perſecuted the Church of Chriſt, and taught, that in ſo doing, they did God good ſeruice: for deuotion without zeale, is like an Arrow ſhot out of a childs Bow, which falleth to the ground without doing hurt or good: and zeale without knowledge, is like a Shippe carryed with full winde and diſplayed Sailes, without a Pilot to ſterne and guide it in the right courſe.
               15. Thus for the maine doctrine. Now the acceſſarie attending vpon it, is more dangerous then the maine it ſelfe: for they are taught, not onely thus to pray, but that theſe prayers are meritorious of ſaluation; and that hee which ſaith a certaine number of them, ſhall haue thus many dayes, and thus many yeeres pardon: as 3000. dayes, for ſaying a ſhort prayer in the Primer: ten thouſand dayes for ſaying fiue Pater noſters before the Vernacle: twenty thouſand dayes, for ſayingNicol. Salic. Antidot. animae. Salisbur. primer. horae beatae Maria. Euang. Roman. a ſhort prayer at the Leuation: yea, a hundred yeeres, for ſaying our Ladyes Pſalter euery Saturday: yea, fiue hundred yeeres for ſaying a ſhort prayer which Saint Gregory made; and a number ſuch like, as hath beene before ſufficiently diſcouered. Now if pardon of ſinnes and ſaluation may be merited by mumbling vp euery day on their Beades theſe ſhort and vncouth prayers, what need any ſeeke for further knowledge in the word of God? If theſe bee ſufficient (as they make the people beleeue) then all further inſtruction muſt needs be thought vnneceſſary: and ſo it cannot chooſe but follow, that a deluge of blindneſſe and ignorance muſt needs ouerflow the world, as wofull experience hath taught to bee true in thoſe places where the Romiſh Religion preuaileth.
               16. Thirdly, they teach, that Images and Pictures are Lay mens Bookes, wherein they muſt read, and with the which

they muſt content themſelues, without ſearching at all into the Booke of God. This doctrine taught Gulielmus Peraldus
                  Perald. Sum virtut. & vit. tom. 1. cap. 3. three hundred yeeres ſince, ſaue that hee ioyned the Scripture and Images together; for thus he writeth, As the Scriptures be the Bookes of the Clergie: ſo Images and the Scripture are the Bookes of Lay men: where hee equalleth a dumbe and dead Picture, to the ſpeaking and liuely Scriptures: the worke of man, to the Word of God. But Loelius Zechius, a

Feuardent. lib. hom. pag. 16. 17. hom. 2. learned and famous Diuine of latter time, goeth further, and ſaith, that Images are the onely Bookes for them that bee vnlearned, to draw them to faith and knowledge, and imitation of diuine matters. Yea, another Fryer, that liueth in Paris at this day, or at leaſt, was aliue very lately, goeth yet a degree further, and affirmeth, that Lay men may more eaſily learne diuine myſteries by contemplation of Images, then out of the Booke of God: and all theſe are (as they ſtile them) moſt Catholike and holy Bookes. But what ſhould I ſearch further into theſe petty Diſciples? whereas the grand Doctor himſelfe hath this propoſition in expreſſe words, Meliùs interdum docet pictura,
                  Bell. de Imag. lib. 2. cap. 10. 
                  quàm ſcriptura: A Picture doth better inſtruct ſometimes, then the Scripture.
               16. This is their Doctrine. Now what fruits doth it bring foorth? Surely the beſt fruit is ignorance, a worſe then that error, and the worſt of all ſuperſtition and and idolatry: for howſoeuer, we deny not that there may be an hiſtoricall and ciuill vſe of Pictures, either to put vs in minde of our abſent friends, or to repreſent ſome obſeruable hiſtory and notable deede done, or to ſtirre vs vp to the imitation of the vertues of Godly men and women: yet we conſtantly affirme, that to make them the Bookes of Lay men, either to be inſtructed by them alone, without the Booke of God, or to finde better and more perfect inſtruction in them then in it, is to inwrap the people in a cloude of foggie and miſtie ignorance, and to hood-winke their eyes, that they ſhould not ſee the bright ſhining light of truth: for where is all ſound & ſauing knowledge to bee found, but in the holy Scripture? whither doth our Sauiour Chriſt ſend his Diſciples, but vnto them? he doth

not ſay vnto them, Gaze vpon Pictures, for they be they that teſtifie of me: and, In them yee ſhall finde eternall life: but, Search the Scriptures, for, &c. And the Prophet Dauid, that it is the Law of God that giueth wiſedome vnto the ſimple; and
                  Pſal. 19. 7. 8. 
                  that conuerteth the ſoule, and giueth light vnto the eyes: and not the Pictures of Abraham, Iſaac, and Iacob, or of any of the Prophets. And therefore though a man may be inſtructed by a Picture, touching a thing done; yet moſt certaine it is, that more excellent, and more perfect inſtruction is gotten by the Scripture: for let an vnskilfull man returne neuer ſo often to the beholding of his Picture, it will alwaies repreſent the ſame thing vnto him; and if any ſcruple or doubt remaine in his minde, it can anſwere nothing for the explication thereof: whereas in holy Scripture, that which is obſcure in one place, is explained in another; and that which in one Chapter we cannot conceiue, in the next following it may be is ſo cleerely ſet downe, that a childe may diſcerne it without erring: ſo that as a man may diſcouer his meaning by ſignes and becks, yet it is not ſo effectuall as if he vtter it by word of mouth: ſo Pictures may teach, but yet Scripture teacheth more fully and effectually. And therefore to tye the people to theſe dumbe Bookes, and diſcharge them from ſearching into the Booke of God, is to depriue them of the chiefeſt meanes of knowledge, and ſo to foſter them in ignorance.
               17. But yet this is not all. For beſides that it occaſioneth ignorance, an Image alſo is a teacher of lyes, as the ProphetHabak. 2. 18. 
                  Habakuk calleth it, and a mother, and a nurſe of ſuperſtition, and Idolatry. For firſt, how many Pictures are there in their Churches, of Monſters, and miracles that neuer were? As of Saint George, killing the Dragon. Saint Chriſtopher, carrying Chriſt vpon his ſhoulder, ouer the Ford. Saint Catherine tormented vpon the wheele, and diſputing with the Philoſopher. Saint Dunſtane holding the Diuell by the noſe, or lip, with a paire of Pincers. Saint Denis carrying his owne head in his hands, being ſtrooke off. Saint Dominick burning the Deuils fingers with a Candle, which hee made him to hold, will

he, nill hee. And an infinite number ſuch like, which either neuer were extant in the world, or were not ſuch, neither euer did worke ſuch feates as are repreſented by their Pictures. Two Pictures I cannot paſſe ouer in ſilence, which I haue ſeen and obſerued with my owne eyes: the one at the Church of Ramſey, in Huntington-ſhire, neere adioyning vnto that, quondam a famous and rich Abbay. In this Church, in the loweſt window, in the right Ile, is a picture of a paire of Ballance, in one skole whereof is the Deuill, and in the other, a woman, and the woman is more ſinfull then the Deuill, ouerweighing him euen to the ground. Behold, a Lay mans book, whereat wiſe men may wonder, fooles may laugh, and women may bee inraged, and euery one may read the folly and prophanenes of thoſe times. Sure I am, heere is little inſtruction for the ſoules health. The other is in the Cloiſter window of the cathedrall Church of Peterborough, where is painted out at large the hiſtory of Chriſts paſſion. In one place whereof, our Sauiour Chriſt ſitteth with his twelue Apoſtles, eating his laſt Paſſeouer: which becauſe it was vpon the Thurſday night before Eaſter, commonly called Maundey Thurſday: therefore they picture before him in a diſh, not a Lambe as the truth was, but becauſe it was Lent, (O miſerable blindneſſe) three pickerels: ſo that now the Paſchall Lambe is turned into a Paſchall pickerell, and all forſooth, to nouriſh in the people, the ſuperſtition of the Lent faſt. For if they ſhould ſee Chriſt eating fleſh in Lent, what an incouragement would this be (thought they) for the people to doe the like?
               18. And thus Images may wel be called Laymens bookes. But what bookes, you ſee, euen ſuch as teach lyes, and ſuperſtition, & no ſound and true inſtruction. I could heere relate how that Saint Dunſtane put life (by a trunke forſooth) into the Image of the Virgin Mary, and made her ſpeake againſt the marriage of Prieſts, when that controuerſie could no otherwiſe bee decided. And how the Image of the Crucifixe
                     Bez. de ſig. lib. 14 cap 3. vſed to ſpeake to Saint Francis, to the end, to giue authority to the order of his fraternity: and that vpon two Images in a Church at Venice, the one of Saint Dominick, the other of

Saint Paul, were written theſe words: On Pauls: By this man
                  
                     Antonin. part. 3. tit. 23. c. 1. §. 1. 
                  you may come to Chriſt. On Dominicks: But by this man you may doe it eaſilier: becauſe Pauls doctrine led but to faith, and the obſeruation of the Commandements: but Dominicks taught the obſeruation of Councils, which is the eaſier way. All this, and aſmuch more might be produced to this purpoſe. But I conclude the point with the cenſure and confeſſion of their owneGuliel. Miniat. Epiſcop. Ration. Diuin. Caſſand. conſult. pag. 176. 
                  Caſſander, who out of the writings of William Biſhop of Miniatum, concludeth with him, that as if officious lyes ſhould bee added to the holy Scriptures, there would remaine no authority nor weight in them. So, no errour nor falſhood ſhould be tolerated in Images and Pictures in the Church, ſeeing that an errour not reſiſted, is receiued for a trueth. And in the ſame place, the ſame Caſſander doth bewaile the abuſe of Images in the Church of Rome, affirming that ſuperſtition was too much pampered thereby, & that Chriſtians were nothing behind the Heathō, in the extreme vanity of framing, adorning, and worſhipping of Images. Thus farre Caſſander: out of which we may perceiue the chiefe leſſons that are learned out of theſe Lay bookes, to wit, ignorance, ſuperſtition, and Idolatry. And therefore▪ no maruaile if all theſe vices raigne in the midſt of their Church, as plentifully, as amongſt the Heathen themſelues.
               19. Fourthly, they deliuer for ſound doctrine, that whereas Saint Iohn ſayth, that they which haue the anointing of the holy Ghoſt, know all things: Hee meaneth not, that euery one ſhould haue all knowledge in himſelfe perſonally, but that euery one that is of that happy ſociety, to which Chriſt promiſed
                     Rhemiſt. in Ioh. 
                     
                        •
                     . 20. and gaue the holy Ghoſt, is partaker of all other mens graces and gifts in the ſame holy Spirit to ſaluation. And thus whereas Saint Iohn meaneth, that euery true Chriſtian, both by the outward preaching of the word, and by the inward vnction of the Spirit, hath a diſtinct knowledge of all things neceſſary to ſaluation: They ſay, that it is ſufficient, if he be partaker of another mans knowledge, though he be empty & voyde himſelfe. Then which, what can be a greater nouriſher of ignorance, and quencher of knowledge? For if I may bee ſaued by anothers mans knowledge and faith; And if it bee not required that I ſhould know al things neceſſary to ſaluation

in my owne perſon, but may haue a ſhare of another mans knowledge, what need I greatly ſeeke for knowledge my ſelfe? And why may I not repoſe the hope of my ſaluation vpon other men? And heereby wee may obſerue their groſſe abſurdity, In the caſe of iuſtification they teach, that wee are not made righteous by the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, imputed vnto vs, though hee bee the head of the body of the Church, and the Spirit that animateth it, proceedeth from him; and yet heere they ſay, that a man may be made wiſe and knowing, by the knowledge of other their fellow members in the ſame body, abiding in the vnity of Chriſts Church. What is this, but to aduance the members aboue the head, or at leaſt, to forget themſelues, not caring what they ſay, ſo that they maintaine the cauſe they haue in hand?
               20. I, but Saint Auguſtine ſayth, If thou loue vnity: for thee
                  
                     Auguſt. tract. in Ioh. 32. Idem in Pſal. 130. 
                  alſo hath he, whoſoeuer hath any thing in it: it is thine which I haue: it is mine which thou haſt. And againe in another place hee ſayth: When Peter wrought miracles, he wrought them for me, becauſe I am in that body, in which Peter wrought them. In which body, though the eye ſeeth, and not the eare: and the eare heareth, and not the eye: yet the eye heareth in the eare, and the eare ſeeth in the eye, &c. Therefore, all the grace and knowledge that is in any other of Gods Saints, either liuing, or dead, is ours by participation: And ſo, that which was ſufficient in them, for their ſaluation, is alſo enough for vs, for ours, though wee haue little, or none of our owne. Thus reaſon our Rhemiſts, in the place before quoted. But I anſwere firſt, with our reuerend, learned countrey-man, Doctor Fulk, that Saint Auguſtine vnderſtandeth that place of Saint Iohn, of an actuall, and perſonall knowledge, inſpired by the holy Ghoſt, concurring with the outward miniſtery of the Church, and not of any generall knowledge infuſed into the Church, to bee transfuſed, and diſperſed among the members, by an imputatiue participation. Secondly, if a man may know by another mans knowledge, why may not a man bee righteous by anothers righteouſneſſe? And if the knowledge of our fellow members may bee imputed to vs, that wee thereby may bee ſaide to know, why may not the iuſtice of our head bee ſo

imputed vnto vs, that thereby wee may bee made iuſt? Theſe things are ſo paralell, that the one being granted, the other needs muſt follow. Thirdly, and laſtly, that communion which is betwixt the members of a body, either naturall or myſticall, is not an actuall tranſlation of gifts from one to another: but either a participation in the fruit of thoſe gifts, or a generating of the like in others, by doctrine, example, exhortation, prayers, and ſuch like meanes. And ſo wee may truely ſay, that euery one that is in the body of Chriſt, reapeth fruit and benefit, by all the graces and gifts that euer haue, or ſhall belong to any member thereof, though not for merit, yet for comfort, inſtruction, edification, and increaſe of grace. And againe, as one candle lighteth another, and one ſteele ſharpeneth, and whetteth another: So wiſedome and grace is deriued from one to another; either by naturall commerce of ſpeech, or patterne of example. Thus much did Saint Auguſtine intend, and no more: and therefore, it neuer came into his minde to thinke, (as theſe idle braines would make him) that the knowledge which reſided in the Saints of God, is actually in all Gods Children, or that they are partakers of their gifts and graces, to their ſaluation. For he that will be ſaued, muſt beleeue for himſelfe, and know for himſelfe, and liue godly for himſelfe. If hee doe all theſe things by a proxy, hee muſt alſo goe to Heauen by a proxy, and not by himſelfe. This doctrine therefore is a manifeſt breeder and maintainer of ſuch groſſe ignorance, as both Saint Auguſtine and all other holy men haue alwayes condemned for a ſinne.
               21. A fift doctrine from whence ignorance ſpringeth and ariſeth, is their prohibiting of Lay men to diſpute, touching matters of faith, and that vnder paine of excommunication. This Nauarre propoundeth as the doctrine of their
                     Nauar. Enchir. in 1. praecept. cap. 11. Aquin. 2. 2 q. 10 art. 7.

                        ell. de verb Dei Interpret l. 3. c 8 Church, neither is it contradicted by any other. Aquinas goeth further, and ſayth, that it is vnlawfull to dispute of matters of faith, in the preſence of thoſe that are ignorant and ſimple. And Bellarmine taketh away from the people, all power of iudging of their Paſtours doctrine, ſaying, that they muſt beleeue whatſoeuer they teach, except they broach ſome new doctrin,
                  
                  which hath not beene heard of in the Church before. And if they doe ſo, yet they muſt iudge of them no otherwiſe, then by referring them to their ordinary Paſtour, which is the Pope, to whoſe definitiue ſentence they muſt yeeld full conſent, withoutIdem de Cleri. l. 1. cap. 7. further examination. Nay, he moſt ſhamefully affirmeth, that if their ordinary Paſtour teach a falſhood, and another that is not their Paſtour, teach the contrary truth: yet the people ought to follow their Paſtour erring, rather then the other telling the truth. And thus the poore people muſt rely al their knowledge vpon their Paſtours, and may not in any caſe examine and try their Spirits, whether they be of God, or no, cleane contrary to the Precept of our Sauior, Ioh. 5. 39. Search
                  Ioh. 5. 39 Act. 17 
                  the Scriptures: And to the practice of the Bereans, who examined Pauls doctrine by the Scriptures: And to the counſell of Saint Iohn to all, To try the Spirits. Now, who ſeeth not thatIoh. 5. 1 this confirmeth, and cheriſheth the people in ignorance? For if they may not diſpute about any matter of faith themſelues, nor heare others that are learned ſo to doe, nor examine the doctrine of their ordinary Paſtours, but beleeue whatſoeuer they teach, bee it true, or falſe: what remaineth, but that they ſhould lye, and tumble in ignorance, and ſuperſtition, ſeeing the ordinary meanes of getting knowledge, and finding out the truth, is taken from them? For when they are bound to ſwallow downe all the doctrines on the one ſide, and may not ſo much as heare, or read the reaſons of the other, nor weigh them together in the Ballance of iudgement, how is it poſſible that they ſhould euer finde out the truth?
               22. Wee confeſſe with Saint Paul, that the weake are not to bee admitted to controuerſies of diſputation. But what diſputations?Rom. 14. 1 Mary, about needleſſe queſtions, touching matters indifferent, as meat and drinke, and difference of dayes, as the Apoſtle explaineth himſelfe in the ſame Chapter: Or fooliſh, and vnlearned queſtions that ingender ſtrife, and are not profitable
                  2. Tim. 2. 23 1. Tim. 1. 4 
                  to edification. But if the diſputation bee concerning matters of ſaluation, and diſquiſition of a neceſſary truth, then are none to bee excluded either from reaſoning, or hearing. For

Saint Peter requireth of euery man, that hee be able to giue an
                  1. Pet. 3. 15. 
                  anſwere to euery one that asketh a reaſon of the hope that is in him. And therefore to diſpute: for what is to diſpute, but to giue a reaſon? And our Sauiour diſputed with the Phariſes and Sadduces, in the audience of the people, touching the reſurrection, and the greateſt Commandement of the Law, and his humane, and diuine nature. And ſo likewiſe did Saint Paul with the Grecians and with the Iewes, conuincingMat. 22. 23. Act. 9. 29. Act. 17. 17. Act. 19. 8. 9. them by arguments out of the Scripture, That Ieſus was the Chriſt, and that there was no way to ſaluation, but by ſaith in his Name. From ſuch diſputations as theſe, none was debarred; but euery one was, and is bound to ſeeke a firme reſolution, that hee bee not carried about with euery winde of doctrine. True it is, euery ſimple man and woman ought not preſently to ruſh out into arguments of diſputation, nor too peremptorily to talke of deep myſteries in Religion: for then it may bee ſaid vnto them, as Saint Baſill is reported to haueTheodoret. biſ
                        •
                     o. l. 4. c. 17. anſwered the Emperors Cook, Tuum eſt de pulmentis cogitare, non diuina dogmata concoquere: It is thy part to looke to thy ſauces, and dainty diſhes, and not to boyle (in thy ſhallow wit) heauenly myſteries. And therefore, they muſt, as Saint Ierome ſpeaketh, not lacerare Scripturam, teare in pieces theHierom. in epiſt. ad Paulin. Scriptures, by their ignorant interpretations, and applications of it: Nor docere antequam didicerunt: Teach others, before they haue learned themſelues: But like Pythagoras ſchollers, keepe ſilence long, till they be wel grounded in knowledge: neuertheleſſe, all this while, they muſt not be barred from hearing others diſcourſe of theſe high matters; nor from reading their arguments, pro & contra: nor at length alſo, when they are come to ſome perfection, from arguing, and reaſoning with the aduerſary: For this is the high way to knowledge and vnderſtanding, the Lord hauing promiſed to all thoſe that pray vnto him, and doe his will, whether they bee Prieſts, or people, the illumination of his Spirit, and power to diſcerne of doctrines. They that deny therefore this liberty vnto the people, doe barre them out from all ſound knowledge, andIoh. 7. 17. & 16. 13. impriſon them in a gaole of ignorance, blindneſſe, and ſuperſtition.
               
                  23. Laſtly, their braue doctrine, touching Implicite faith, doth tend to the ſame end, and bring forth the fame effect, and that more effectually then any of the reſt. For thus they teach, that it is not neceſſary for a Layman, to know anymore, by
                  Molan. tract. 3. c. 27. ant. 15. Bonauent. Durand. 
                  a distinct knowledge, ſaue ſome few capitall heads of Religion, as, that there is one God, and three perſons. That Chriſt is come in the fleſh, and redeemed vs from our ſinnes, and ſhall com againe to iudge the quicke and the dead, &c. As for the reſt, it is ſufficient to giue aſſent vnto the Church, and beleeue as it beleeueth, though they know not what it beleeueth; yea, that they are not bound expreſly to beleeue all the Articles of the Apoſtles Creed, which is notwithſtanding nothing els but a briefe ſumme and Epitome of Chriſtian Religion, and one of the principall grounds of the Catechiſme. And this is the Colliers faith ſpoken of before, ſo much commended by many of their greateſt Clarks. Now how can this but nouriſh moſt groffe ignorance? For when the people are perſwaded that ſuch a ſhort ſcantling of knowledge is ſufficient, and that it is enough for their ſaluatiō, if in a reuerence to the Church, they beleeue as it beleeueth: what reaſon haue they either to labour to get any further knowledge, or to increaſe and grow vp in that which they haue attained vnto? Surely, in matters of Religion, ſo great is the auerſeneſſe of our nature, that wee are all ſo farre from endeuouring to get more then is needfull; that few ſeeke for ſo much. And therefore they that bound our knowledge within ſo narrow limits, cheriſh this corruption, and by ſpeaking pleaſing things vnto it, lull it aſleepe in the bed of ignorance. But in the meane time, how contrary is this to the word of God, let the world indge, ſeeing the Apoſtle prayeth for the Coloſſians, that they might bee fulfilled
                  Col. 1. 10. 11. 
                  with the knowledge of Gods will, in all wiſedome, and ſpirituall vnderſtanding: and that they might increaſe in the knowledge of God: Whereas theſe fellowes would haue Gods people to bee empty of knowledge, and in ſtead of growing, to ſtand at a ſtay, reſting vpon the ſuppoſed knowledge of the Church. And whereas the ſame Apoſtle ſaith vnto the Theſſalonians, I would not haue you ignorant, brethren, ſpeaking in1. Theſſ.

the ſame place, of very high and deepe myſteries: as the ſtate of the dead, the reſurrection and aſt iudgement: they on the contrary ſay to their people, W

                  e would haue you ignorant, brethren. Theſe things are ſo groſſe and ſhamefull, that if the Church of Rome were not the whore of Babylon, ſhe would bluſh, that any ſuch imputation ſhould iuſtly be laid vnto her charge.
               24. Theſe bee the Romiſh doctrines, which directly, and naturally ingender, and maintaine ignorance: and therefore no maruaile, if a flood of ignorance doth ouer-flow the field of their Church, ſeeing it burſteth forth by ſo many ſpowts. Let vs take a view therefore a little of the effects and fruits of theſe doctrines, both in the Clergie, and the people. Touching the ignorance of the Romiſh Clergie, what it hath beene in former ages, and is yet at this day, though the Ieſuites bragge neuer ſo much of their new learning, and labour to wipe away that ſtaine from their faces, let their owne writers ſpeake. Platina the Popes Secretary thus complaineth of the horriblePlatin. in vit. Marcelli. corruption and ignorance of the Prieſts in his dayes: Quanta ſit auaritia Sacerdotum, &c. How great is the couetouſneſſe of Prieſts (ſayth he) and eſpecially of thoſe that bee in chiefeſt authority! how great leachery, how great ambition and pompe, how great pride and idleneſſe, how great ignorance both of themſelues and Chriſtian doctrine, how little Religion, &c! I need not declare, when they themſelues doe ſo openly proclaime it, as though they ſought praiſe thereby. This complaint hee maketh in the life of Marcellus the firſt, and the like in Denis the firſt: Boniface the fift: Stephen the third, and Gregory the fourth. The like complaint or worſe, maketh one Bredenbachius, Deane of the Church of Mentz, in Germany, inBredenbach. in ſuae peregrin. hiſt. the time of Charles the fourth, and yeere of our Lord, 1370. The Law (ſaith he) is departed from Prieſts, Counſell from the Elders, Charity from Prelates, Religion from Monks, Diſcipline from Clerks, Learning from teachers, Study from Schollers, &c. and in the end he burſteth foorth into this exclamation, O times! ô manners! moſt trouble ſome and miſerable times! reprobate and wicked manners both of Clergie and
                  
                  people! Mathew Paris ſaith, that in the time of William theMath. Pariſ. in Guliel. Conqueſt. Conqueror, Clerks were ſo vnlearned in England, that ſuch that vnderſtood their Grammar, were a wonderment to their fellowes. And for Italy, Eſpenſaeus▪

                  Aluarus Pelagius, that the Biſhops there committed thouſands of ſoules to ſome young Nephewes of theirs, to whom a man would bee loth to commit two peares to be kept. And for Germanie, let vs heare their owne complaint, that moſt vſually Biſhops

               25. And therefore we neede not wonder, when we read of many Popes that were vtterly vnlearned, euen ſo farre, that they knew not the Grammar: as that Pope that ſaid (as it is reported) Fiatur, in ſtead of Fiat: and being told, that it was falſe Latine; anſwered, that in ſpight of Priſcian, and all Grammarians, it ſhould be euer after canonized for true Latine.

                     . 1033 nu. 6. Glab. Rodulph. Pope, was a childe, about ten yeeres old: and therefore could not haue any great ſtore of wiſedome in him at thoſe yeeres. And if Popes haue beene thus ignorant, which are the heads of the Church, no maruell if Cardinalls, which are the necke, and Archbiſhops and Biſhops, which are the ſhoulders, and Prieſts and Fryers, which are but the armes and legges, bee voyd of all vnderſtanding: for how can the members bee

wiſe, if the head be a foole? And therefore when wee read, that Lois Marſilius, an Auguſtinian Fryer, being asked, what the two ſtrops of the Biſhops Miter ſignified? anſwered, that they repreſented, that the Biſhop neuer vnderſtood the Old nor the New Teſtament. We haue no cauſe to wonder at it: neyther when that we read, that a certain Prieſt was of this mind, that whatſoeuer was in print, was as true as the Goſpell. Nor when we heare another of them fiſhing the Virgine Maries name out of the firſt Chapter of Geneſis, where it is written, that God called the gathering together of the waters (Maria) &c. Nor another, that prooued our Sauiour Chriſt to take away the ſinne of the world, becauſe the word Ieſus was written in Hebrew with the letter 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , Sin, in the midſt. But what need I inſiſt in particulars, ſeeing this was one of the rules of a whole Order, called the Franciſcane, or Minorite Fryers 
                     •
                   
                  Neſcientes non curent diſcere literas: Let not the ignorant regard to know letters. Of which rule they euer were moſt obſeruant: from whence ſprings that elegant Epigramme.
               
                  Cauiſti bene tu, ne te vlla occidere poſſit
                  Litera: nam nulla eſt litera not a tibi.
               
               That is in Engliſh thus:
               
                  Preuented well thou haſt the letter that doth kill:
                  For not a letter wilt thou learne, to ſtop this ill.
               
               26. Now then let▪ their Bozius vpbrayd vnto vs the ignorance of all Arts, and bragge of their Ieſuites learning aboue all others. And let their Poſſeuine, and Greſter, and Tanner
                  Boz de ſig. eccleſ. lib. 12. c. 12. Poſſeu. biblioth. doe the ſame: yet they ſhall neuer ſhew a whole Order amongſt vs, and that of Clergie men, that make a profeſſion of Ignorance. As for the eminence of the Ieſuites learning, whereof they bragge ſo much, we enuy it not vnto them, ſo that they will not make themſelues the onely engroſſers of learning, but ſuffer vs, poore men, to retayle ſome part with them, with whom we may boldly ſay, that for number and quality, we haue them that are euery way equall, if not ſuperiour vnto them.
               27. But to leaue their Clergie, and come to the multitude of their Lay people, which are they indeede amongſt

whom we may ſee the true fruit of theſe their doctrines. It is both ſtrange and lamentable to behold the prodigious ignorance of moſt, both men and women, that liue vnder Popery, and haue receiued the marke of the Beaſt on their foreheads: for as the Prieſts teach, ſo the people follow, like a flocke of ſheepe following their Belweather; the one commending ignorance, the other imbracing it with all their hearts. Some of their owne Writers affirme, that the Common people, for theVincent. de fine mundi. moſt part, amongſt them, knew not the Articles of the faith: and if they▪ knew not the Articles of the faith, how can they giue a reaſon of them? which Saint Peter requireth of euery man. As the multitude of the Nineuites knew not their right hand from their left; ſo this rabble know not the right hand of Religion from the left. As for the maine points of the Catechiſme, how can they know them, whereas they are ignorant of the grounds thereof? For the Lords Prayer, the ten Commandements, and the Creede, they rumble vp in the Latine tongue, not vnderſtanding one word what they ſpeake. They ſay Pater noſter, and Credo in Deum, and yet they know not what Pater meaneth, nor what Credo ſignifieth. Yea, for the moſt part, they ſo miſtearme the words thereof, that their language is more like to the babling of Infants, or rather the prattling of Parrats, then the ſpeech of men. Neither is this ignorance onely to be found among the baſeſt of the people, which haue no teaching and education, but euen amongſt the better ſort of them, that are well borne and brought vp: and after ſo ſtrange and ſtrong a faſhion, that by no meanes can they be withdrawne from this inueterate and continued cuſtome of their Anceſtors. Hence ſpringeth all that groſſe ſuperſtition which is vſed of them: as, creeping to the Croſſe, falling downe before Images, adoring and beautifying them with new-faſhioned garments, running a Pilgrimage to this Saint and that, ſetting vp Tapers before their ſhrines, wearing about their necks the beginning of the Goſpell of Saint Iohn, as a preſeruatiue againſt the Diuell, and the herbe Veruine, being croſſed and bleſſed, againſt blaſts, the white Pater noſter, and the little Creede, with an infinite number of

ſuch like ſuperſtitious vanities, whereof there is neyther head nor foote. Would any that are not plunged ouer head and eares in ignorance, put any affiance in ſuch trumperie? and yet herein is all the Religion of the vulgar, who repoſe euen the hope of their ſaluation in theſe things, and thinke it a greater ſinne to neglect or omit one of theſe Ceremonies, then to breake any of the Commandements of God.
               28. Now let any man iudge whether this can be the true Religion, which nouriſheth this barbarous and monſtrous ignorance and ſuperſtition amongſt the people: and whether that can be▪ a good tree, which bringeth forth ſuch bitter and ſowre fruits. This is the concluſion which groweth out of the premiſes, by neceſſary conſequence.
            
            
               
                  The XI. MOTIVE. That Religion which was neuer knowne nor heard of in the Apoſtles time, nor in the Primitiue Church, cannot be the truth: but ſuch is the Romiſh Religion in moſt points thereof: therefore that cannot be the truth.
               1. THe Romaniſts triumph in no one thing ſo much, as in the antiquitie of their Church and Religion: and therefore they caſt euermore into our teeth, that our Religion is but vp-ſtart, and our Church of yeſterday, euen ſince Luthers time, being neuer extant in the world before. But herein they play but the Sophiſters: for if they ſpeake of true antiquitie, we will ioyne iſſue with them in this point, and doubt not but to prooue that theirs is the vp-ſtart Church, and their Religion the new Religion, in thoſe points wherein they differ from vs: and that our faith and Religion was taught and profeſſed by Chriſt himſelfe, and his Apoſtles, and exerciſed and maintained in the pure and primitiue Age of the Church. For the cleere manifeſtation of which point, it is firſt to be obſerued, that there is a double antiquitie; one primary, another ſecundary: Primary is that, which was from

the beginning, though diſcontinued and interrupted by the corruption of times. Secundary is that, which indeede is aged and gray-headed, but yet reacheth not to the ſpring head. Thus our Sauiour Chriſt controlleth the law of Diuorce Mat. 19. 8. though it was aged and of long continuance, euen two thouſand yeeres old; yet Nonſic fuit ab initio: It was not ſo from the beginning: where we ſee that Diuorce was old and full of yeeres, and yet farre from true antiquitie: for true antiquitie is that which is deriued ab initio, from the beginning. In regard of this, it is truely ſaid of Tertullian, Ʋerum
                  Tertull. 
                  quod primum, falſum quod poſterius: That which is firſt, is alwaies true, and that which commeth later, is falſe: but in reſpect of the other, it is alſo as truely ſpoken of Saint Auguſtine, Eſtmos diabolicus, vt per antiquitatis traducem commendetur
                  Aug. nou. & vet teſta. quaeſt. 114 
                  fallacia: It is a diuelliſh cuſtome, that error ſhould be commended by the deſcent of antiquitie. Secondly, it is to be obſerued, that no antiquitie, be it neuer ſo ancient and hoare-headed, is to be reuerenced or regarded, if it bee not grounded vpon the truth of the Scriptures: and that which ſeemeth nouelty, if it bring Scripture for it warrant, is truely ancient, and hath true, certaine, and vnreſiſtable authoritie: the reaſon is giuen by Aquina
                        •
                     , Becauſe the Law of God proceedeth
                  Aquin. 2. part. quaeſt. 97. art. 3. 
                  from the will of God, and therefore may not be altered by cuſtome proceeding from the will of man: whence it is, that no cuſtome ought to preuaile againſt the Law of God. To which purpoſe is that of Tertullian, Hereſies are to bee conuinced, not
                  Tertull. lib. de 
                        •
                     cland. virginib. 
                  ſo much by noueltis, as by verity: whatſoeuer ſauours againſt the truth, that ſhall bee hereſie; yea, though neuer ſo ancient. And of Cyprian, If onely Chriſt is to bee heard, wee ought not to
                  Cyprian. lib. 2. Epiſt. 3. ad Caecilium. 
                  regard what any before vs hath thought fit to bee done; but what Chriſt, who is before all, hath firſt done: for we muſt not follow the cuſtome of man, but the truth, of God: and in another place,Idem ad Pompeia. cont. Epiſt. Steph. Papae. Clem. Alex. orat. ad Gent. pag. 41. 
                  Cuſtome without truth, is nothing but antiquitie of error. Vpon this ground alſo Clemens Alexandrinus, in an Oration to the Gentiles, (who pretended antiquitie for their errors, as the Romaniſts now doe, ſaying, that they, and their Fathers before them, were borne and bred in that Religion, and therefore

will not now giue it ouer, ſaith, Let vs flye cuſtome as a rocke, or the threates of Charybdis, or the fabulous Syrenes, for it
                  Aug. de baptiſme paruulorum. 
                  choaketh a man: it turneth from the truth, it leadeth from life, it is a ſnare, a helliſh gulfe, an euill fanne, &c. And Saint Auguſtine, Truth being knowne, cuſtome is not to be followed: for our Sauiour did not ſay, I am cuſtome, but, I am truth. Now vpon theſe grounds wee offer to ioyne iſſue with them: Firſt, that they haue no true and primitiue antiquitie for their Religion: and ſecondly, though ſome of their opinions be of long continuance, yet being not warrantable by Scriptures, they ought not to preiudice, by a conceit of nouelty, that primitiue and Apoſtolicall truth, which by corrupt time hath beene interrupted. And this I hope to diſcourſe ſo plainely in this Argument following, that no indifferent reader, that ſeemeth not foreſtalled with preiudice, ſhall depart vnſatisfied.
               2. Concerning the firſt propoſition, I take it to bee of anMaior. 2. vndeniable truth: for, without all queſtion, all truth was taught by the Apoſtles to the Primitiue Church, and no part thereof was left vnreuealed: for ſo Saint Paul ſaith in plaine tearmes to the Elders of Epheſus, I haue deliuered vnto you
                  Act 20. 
                  the whole counſaile of God. Now if hee deliuered to them the whole counſaile of God, then no part of his counſaile, that concerned the myſterie of Chriſtian Religion, was vndeliuered. Beſides, it is as certaine that that Church, which next ſucceeded the Apoſtles, was the moſt pure and abſolute Church, whether for doctrine, or manners, matter, or forme, that euer was in the world: and therefore to degenerate from that, muſt needes be, to degenerate from the puritie and ſanctity of Religion. And againe, it cannot bee denyed, that though ſome hereſies were broached, euen in the Apoſtles times, and were coetaneae Apoſtolorum, as Tertullian noteth:Tertull praeſcrip. and though the primitiue age of the Church, after the Apoſtles, was moſt peſtered with Heretikes, yet euermore the truth preuailed, both in regard of birthright, and predominance. And therefore they that will plead antiquitie, muſt both preſcribe from the Apoſtles time, and muſt haue a good title alſo to hold by: for theſe two things are neceſſarily required

to a iuſt preſcription, as the Lawyers ſpeake, Bonus titulus: A good title: and, Legittimum tempus: A lawfull time. A good title is that which is warranted by the diuine Law: and a lawfull time is that which is fetcht from Chriſt Ieſus and his Apoſtles: both theſe, concurring together, are an inuincible argument of the truth: The firſt propoſition therefore muſt needes be infallibly true.
               3. And ſo I leaue it, and come to the ſecond propoſition:Minor. the truth whereof ſhall bee manifeſted in two poynts: firſt, in reſpect of the outward face and faſhion of their Church: and ſecondly, in reſpect of the principall doctrines, which are proper vnto them, as they are the Romiſh Synagogue.
               3. For the firſt. The outward face of the Church deuideth it ſelfe into three branches: firſt, into the perſons that exerciſe preeminence and authoritie in it: and ſecondly, into the iuriſdiction and authoritie exerciſed by thoſe perſons: and thirdly, into the outward ceremonies thereof. In all theſe the Church of Rome is degenerate from the Primitiue and Apoſtolicall puritie.
               4. The principall perſons of the Romiſh Hierarchie are1. theſe. The Pope firſt, as the ring-leader: next, the Cardinals, his Counſellors of ſtate: then Archbiſhops and Biſhops, his aſſiſtants: and laſtly, the ſhaueling Prieſts his vaſſals: to which body may be added, as excrements, an infinite rabble of religious Orders▪ as Monks, Fryers, and He

                  mits, with ſuch like: and of Fryers, the Dominicanes, the Franciſcanes, the Auſtinians, the Ambroſians, the Minorites, the Gilbertines, the Croſſebearers, the Ciſterenſians, the Blacke, the White, the Gray, the Bare-footed, the Begging, with a number more: and to conclude, the Ieſuites, which as they are the taile of all the reſt for the time, ſo they are the head of all the reſt for vill▪nous conſpiracies, bloudy plots, diuel

                     •
                   (Biſhops onely excepted) wee finde not ſo much as any mention, neither in the writing of the Apoſtles, nor in the age next ſucceeding after them: for though the name Pope, Papa, being a word of the Syracuſan Language, and ſignifying as much as Pater,
                  
                  Father, be of great antiquitie, yet, as a Ieſuite of their owneAzor. Ieſuit. Inſtitut. moral. p.

But as touching Cardinals, the matter is more groſſe: for the firſt birth and originall of that name can be deriued no higher, then eyther from Gregory the firſts time, or Pope Silueſter, or Marcellus,

Therefore Cardinals are of God: which is as good a conſequent, as his that would prooue, that Heretikes ought to be put to death by Scripture, becauſe Saint Paul ſaid, Haereticum hominem deuita, &c. as hath beene ſhewed before. As for the name of Biſhops, wee deny not but it is found in Scripture, and ſo Archbiſhop may alſo be warranted by the ſame authositie, as ſignifying nothing elſe but a chiefe Biſhop: but how farre the Romiſh Archbiſhops and Biſhops are degenerate from their office, deſcribed by the Scripture, all the world can witneſſe: for the Scripture Biſhops were diligent Preachers, theſe are idle Prelates: they were perſecuted, theſe are perſecutors: they were humble perſons, theſe are proud Princes: they were holy men, ſeeking onely the aduancement of the Kingdome of Chriſt, theſe are profane worldlings, ſeeking their owne gaine, and pompe, and carnall honours: all this is confeſſed of them, and lamented by Eſpenſaeus, one of the ſame ranke, who thus writeth, It was no leſſe a wonder in olde
                  Eſpenſ. in 1. Tim. digreſ. l. 2. c. 2. 
                  times (ſaith he) to be called a Biſhop, and not to preach, then he is now as rare as a monſter, who is ſeen to performe that dutie: and againe, I know (ſaith he) ſome learned Biſhops, who ſtanding vpon their Gentilitie, forſooth, and greatneſſe, hold it a matter of ſeruitude and baſeneſſe, to be exerciſed in preaching, becauſe their predeceſſors were not accuſtomed thereunto.
               
               
                  5. As touching Prieſts in the new Teſtament phraſe, allPhil. 4 18. 1. Pet. 2. 5. Reu. 6. 8. 15. 10 Chriſtians are called Prieſts: and they, whoſe office it is to diſpoſe the myſteries of the Goſpell, Miniſters, and Elders, and Paſtors: but now, none may haue that name, but their anoynted Shauelings, who (as they ſay) create their Creator, by fiue coniuring words, and offer him vp vpon the altar, as a Sacrifice propitiatorie for the quicke and the dead. For albeit the word Prieſt is deriued from preſbyter, which ſignifieth an Elder, and in that ſenſe might well be giuen to the Miniſters of the new Teſtament, yet, becauſe it is in common vſe of ſpeech, taken for one appointed to ſacrifice, which in Latine is Sacerdos, and in Greeke 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  : And becauſe the Miniſters of the Goſpell are not once named by theſe termes in the new Teſtament, therefore they that in this ſignification terme the Miniſters of the Goſpell by the name of Prieſts, degenerate from the true meaning of the Scripture: but what ſhould I ſpeake of the name, ſeeing the office of theſe Shauelings is ſo contrarie to that function which was practiſed by the Apoſtles and Diſciples of Ieſus Chriſt? for the Apoſtles are neuer ſaid to ſacrifice Chriſt on the Altar, as theſe Shauelings are pretended to doe. Their office was to miniſter 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , but not to ſacrifice; they receiued of the Lord, and gaue vnto the people: but theſe create a Sacrifice of themſelues, and then offer it vp to the Lord. Here then is a plaine declining of the Romiſh Prieſts from the true Miniſters of the Primitiue Church, both in name and office.
               6. Laſtly, concerning Monkes, Fryers and Hermites, they are names neuer heard of in the Apoſtles time, nor in the purer age of the Church. The firſt Hermite was one Anthony, who liued three hundred yeeres after Chriſt, who taught others that ſtate of life, and learned it of none, as confeſſethBell. de Monach. lib. 2. cap. 5 Agrip. de vanit. ſcient. c. 62. Id. Ibidem. 
                  Bellarmine: Monkes had no being in the beſt times of the Church, ſayth Agrippa; though Bellarmine is not aſhamed to ſay, that the Apoſtles were the firſt Monks in Chriſtianity; who notwithſtanding liued not alone in cels, but went about the world preaching the Goſpell, & ſome of them had wiues alſo, both which are contrarie to the Monkiſh profeſſion, but

Fryers are yet of a far later impreſſiō. The orders of Dominick & Francis ſprung vp vnder Innocent the third, in the time of the Laterane Councill, about the yeere 1220. For when Pope Innocent would not be perſwaded to confirme to Dominick his order of preaching Fryers, hee dreamed that the Church of Laterane was ready to fall, and that Dominick came in, and with his ſhoulders vnder-propped it. Vpon which dreame he preſently ſent for Dominick, and granted his petition: and ſure not vaine was that dreame: for had not Fryers beene the vpholders and chiefe Pillars of the Popes Church, it had fallen longere this. The croutched Fryers, otherwiſe called the croſſe-bearers, ſprang vp about the ſame time for Pope Innocent, raiſing an army againſt the Albingenſes, whom the Pope accounted for Heretikes, cauſed the ſouldiers to be ſigned with a croſſe on their breſt, whereupon they were called croſſe-bearers, or croutched Fryers. All the other orders of Fryers, which amount, as ſome reckon them, to an hundreth at leaſt, are moſt of them of later inſtitution. And moſt true is the aſſertion of Wiclif, that Fryers were neuer knowne in the world, before the yeare 1200.
               7. The Ieſuites tooke their beginning about threeſcore and fifteene yeeres ſince: For in the yeare 1540. their order was firſt confirmed by Pope Paul the third, to Ignatius Loyola the lame ſouldier, the chiefe Father and Patriarch of that viperous brood, at the requeſt and interceſſion of Cardinall Contarenus: ſo that they are not yet beyond the bounds of a mans age, and neuertheleſſe they are growne to ſuch maturity of craft and deceit, that all other orders are but nouices to them: they are the onely fellowes of the world for ſubtill practices, and daring enterpriſes, and now the chiefeſt props of the Papall ſea: For Dominick was weary of bearing that burden, and for the eaſe of himſelfe, ſuffered Loyola to put vnder his ſhoulder; and ſo now all the burden lyeth vpon him: let him hold vp ſtiffely therefore, or els all will goe to wracke.
               8. But now to the purpoſe. Where were all theſe orders in the Apoſtles times, and in the Primitiue age of the Church?

Then men reioyced to be called by the Name of Chriſt; now theſe fellowes glory to be called by the name of Dominick, or Francis; and as if Chriſtians was too baſe a name for them, they will be called Ieſuites, of Ieſus they ſay the Sonne of God: but more truely of Bar-Ieſus the Sorcerer, that withſtoodActs 13. 6. the preaching of Paul, & was a peruerter of the ſtraight wayes of the Lord: or of a French weapon called Geſu

                     , wherewith theſe ſame bloudy Traitours vſe to murther kings and Princes, if they withſtand their purpoſes: whereupon is that elegant Epigram:
               
                  —A Geſis ſunt indita nomina vobis,
                  Quae quia ſacrilegi Reges torquetis in omnes
                  Inde ſacrum nomen, ſacrum ſumpſiſtis & omen.
               
               9. But to ſhut vp in one word all the villany of theſe monſtrous late-borne orders of Fryers, let Aretine an Italian Poet deſcribe them. Frate (ſayth he) in Italian is a Fryer: euery letter of which word doth repreſent the nature of that generation: for Furfanto, a thiefe: Ribaldo, a filthy Ribald: Aſino, an aſſe: Traditore, a Traitour, & Eretico, an Heretike: All together make the true and perfect definition of a Fryer: Or as Lincolnienſis defineth him, A dead carcaſe riſen out of his graue, wrapped in a winding ſheet, and carryed among men by the Deuill.

               10. Thus much touching their perſons. Now for the iuriſdiction exerciſed by theſe perſons, how not onely tranſcendent, but repugnant it hath beene, and is at this day, to that of

the Apoſtles and Primitiue Church, their both Lordly titles, and tyrannous practice doth clearely demonſtrate. For their titles, which of the Apoſtles either aſſumed to himſelfe (which they might haue iuſtly done, if it had beene their due) or receiued from others theſe titles: Vniuerſall Biſhop, Head of the Church: High Prieſt of the world: Prince of Prieſts, and Chriſts

But the Pope of Rome doth challenge to himſelfe all theſe, yea, more then theſe, that he is, as it were a god vpon earth, hauing fulneſſe of power, and yet more, aequè ac Chriſtus Deus, A God aſwell as Chriſt, a beeing of the ſecond intention, compounded of God and man, and yet more, Deus vindictae, a God of reuenge, and another god vpon earth; and laſtly, Stupor mundi, the wonderment of the world, neither God nor man, but a neuter betwixt both. Could ſuch intolerable pride euer enter into the heart of a man? or could the tongue of any wight liuing dare to belch out ſuch horrible blaſphemies? Surely none but hee that is that man of ſinne, who ſitteth in the Temple of God, as God, and to whom is giuen a mouth to blaſpheme the God of Heauen, and in whoſe fore-head is written this name of blaſphemy, Deus ſum, errare non poſſum:

But to the point; Did euer Peter, whoſe ſucceſſour the Pope claimeth to bee, challenge to himſelfe any ſuch titles? or did euer any of the other Apoſtles, or any Biſhop in the Primitiue Church, for the ſpace of three hundreth yeeres? Peter was ſo farre from this pride, that hee giueth charge to all Elders of the Church, that they ſhould not behaue themſelues as Lords ouer Gods heritage. And in1. Pet 5. 3. that very place hee equalleth himſelfe to the reſt, and the reſt to himſelfe, calling himſelfe a fellow Elder: and in anotherActs. 1. 15. Acts. 2. 29. 2. Pet. 1. 10.

                   place hee calleth all the Diſciples his brethren; yea, all the Iſraelites his brethren, and all Chriſtians his brethren: behold his humility. But the Pope acknowledgeth no brethren, but the Cardinals, Patriarkes, and Archbiſhops: Emperours and Kings are his children, and not his brethren; behold his pride: neither did the reſt of the Apoſtles challenge to themſelues any ſuch titles of dignity. For they had learned of Chriſt their Lord and maſter, not to Lord it ouer others, but to humbleLuk. 22. 26.
                  
themſelues, that they might bee exalted. And let them name but one Biſhop of the Primitiue Church, that tooke vpon him any of theſe glorious titles, yea, of the Biſhops of Rome themſelues.
               11. Wee deny not, but that ſome of the ancients haue yeelded vnto the Biſhops of Rome great and honorable titles, but firſt this was in reſpect of their vertue, learning and integrity, and not in reſpect of any preeminence of iuriſdiction. Secondly, wee find none of theſe titles which I ſpeake of, attributed vnto them, but onely the Apoſtles ſucceſſours, and Apoſtolicall Biſhops, not heads of the Church, vniuerſall Biſhops, high Prieſts of the world, &c. which the later Popes haue vſurped. And thirdly, if at any time they were, yet the ſame titles of honour which were aſcribed vnto them, weeBaſil. epiſt. 55 Sidon. Apoll. in lib. 6. epiſt. 1 finde giuen to other Biſhops, aſwell as to the Biſhop of Rome, as to Saint Ambroſe by Saint Baſill; and to one Lupus a Biſhop in France, by Sidonius Apollinaris: And to Fontellus another Biſhop in France, by the ſame man: To Baſill by Nazianzene: To Athanaſius, who is ſaluted by the name of high Biſhop and chiefe Prieſt: And to Cyprian who was honoured with this ſtile, The Biſhop of the whole world. Neither can it bee denyed, but theſe titles grew by little and little to be attributed to the Biſhops of Rome, after the firſt three hundreth yeers of the Church, though they came not to perfection till the perfect reuelatiō of Antichriſt, in the Apoſtolical ſea: but this can neuer bee proued, that either in the Apoſtles times, or in two hundreth yeeres next ſucceeding after, euer any Biſhop arrogated to himſelfe, or any other aſcribed vnto him any of theſe arrogant titles.
               12. A ſufficient argument whereof is this, that Bellarmine
                  Bell. de Rom. Pontif. l. 2. c. 31. propounding this as his laſt reaſon to proue the principality of the Pope, draweth it from the great and famous titles which are attributed vnto him, and ſpending a whole Chapter in that purpoſe, alledgeth not one teſtimony older then Damaſus the Biſhop of Rome, who was elected to that ſea in the yeere 369. Surely if he could haue found out more ancient proofes, he would haue after his manner ſtuffed the Chapter

with them: but in that hee produceth none, it is euident that hee knew none, & indeed that there were none to be known▪ Nay, Gregory the great, one of their owne Popes, that liuedGregor. epi. l. 4 c. 32. & l. 6. c. 24. & l. 4. c. 34 36 ſixe hundreth yeeres after Chriſt, not onely execrated the name of vniuerſall Biſhop, which Iohn the Biſhop of Conſtantinople vſurped, calling it a name of blaſphemy, and a proud and ſuperſtitious title, and him that vſurped it, a fore-runner of Antichriſt; but alſo plainely auoucheth, that none of his predeceſſors vſed that prophane denomination: by which the proud times of Antichriſt were marked out.

                  Nauclerus, Cuſpinian, with many other Hiſtoriographers, affirme, that Boniface the third, and Gregory the ſecond, obtained of the Emperour Phocas, by great labour, the name of Head of the Church: A ſtrange and tyrannical title, neuer publikely vſurped, before that time, in the Church of God; but now new created by Phocas, who hauing killed his LordPaulus Diaconus de geſtis Longobard▪ c. 37

But of all other records of antiquity, moſt pregnant is the Canon of the Africane Council, to condemne the nouelty of theſe ambitious nominations: of which thus writeth our Roffenſis.

               13. Wherefore concerning theſe great titles of honour, wee may conclude with our Sauiour Chriſt, that It was not ſo from the beginning: They are new and vpſtart, in reſpect of true antiquity, enſignes of that pride and arrogancy, which reigned in the Prelates of the Church, in thoſe latter times,Balt.

               14. But leauing their titles, let vs take a ſhort ſuruey of their practice: And firſt let it bee ſhowne, that Peter, or Paul,
                  
or any the reſt of the Apoſtles, or any Biſhop of Rome, or of any other place, did euer take vpon them to depoſe Kings, and diſpoſe of their kingdomes, and to tranſlate them from one to another, and to abſolue ſubiects from their oath of alleageance, and children from the bond of obedience to their parents, to diſpenſe with the Law of God, to haue ſole power of deciſion of controuerſies, to challenge the right of appeales from all countreyes of Chriſtendome: And laſtly, to exerciſe not onely ſpirituall, but alſo temporall coactiue iuriſdiction. But all this power hath beene in former times, and is at this day practiſed by the Biſhop of Rome, and that with that rigour and vehemency, that it is a wonder that they doe not bluſh, ſo much to degenerat from thoſe, whoſe ſucceſſors they claime to be: But no maruaile; for els he ſhould not ſhew himſelfe to bee that Antichriſt, except hee did aduance himſelfe aboue all that is called God on earth: For this is a ſpecial marke of that man of ſinne.

Did euer Peter doe the like? In that Councell of the Apoſtles and Diſciples in the eleuenth of the Acts, when as diuers Chriſtians of the Circumciſion contended againſt him for preaching, and baptizing Cornelius and his houſhold at Ceſarea, which were of the Gentiles, he did not arrogate this ſupereminencie to himſelfe, that he was their chiefe, and head, and therefore ought not to be called to an account by them:

So, Acts 15. when the Apoſtles, and Elders of the Church came together in a Councell to decide that great Controuerfie then mooued in the Church about Circumciſion, Peter behaueth not himſelfe as a Iudge, nor taketh vpon him any authoritie aboue the reſt: but as one of the Apoſtles giueth his opinion, and the determination of the queſtion is ſet downe not vnder his name onely, but in the name of the Apoſtles, Elders, and brethren, that were preſent; yea, Iames was preſident of that Councell, and not Peter,

them firſt, and make them no Clarkes. Thus, Pope Nicholas

Chriſtian Emperors haue no right at all, to make any inquiſition for Monkes, vnleſſe it be in fauour to pittie them. Thus Thomas Becket, Archbiſhop of Canterburie, quarrelled with Henrie the Second, for this cauſe principally, as both Houeden, and Fabain report,
                     Houeden. Hen. 2. Fab. par. 7. c. 237. for that the King went about to puniſh ſuch of the Clergie, as were malefactors, by the temporall Lawes of the Land: which the Archbiſhop vtterly denyed to be lawfull. For this he ſaid, that if a Clarke being within holy Orders, were accuſed of any crime, hee muſt bee iudged by Eccleſiaſticall Iudges; and if he were conuict, he ſhould loſe his Orders, and ſo being excluded from Eccleſiaſticall office and benefice, if after this he incurred the like fault, then might he be iudged at the pleaſure of the King and his Officers. This was that proud Archbiſhops challenge againſt his Soueraigne▪

               20. And that you may ſee that this practice of theirs is agreeable to their Doctrine, Bellarmine himſelfe concludeth,Bellar. de Clericis cap. 28. 
                  That Kings are not Superiours vnto Clarkes, and therefore that they are not bound either by Gods, or mans Law to obey them; ſaue onely, in reſpect of Lawes directiue, and that the Imperiall Law ought in matters criminall to giue place to the Canon Law: which is as much as to ſay, that not the King, but the Pope is the Lord of the Clergie. Did Peter euer doe the like? No, he both in his owne perſon ſubmitted himſelfe to the temporall power, when he paid Tribute at his Maſters Commandement, and when he vnder-went ſtripes and impriſonment for the Goſpels ſ

Some of them haue diſpenſt with diuers Commandements of the Law, with Inceſt, with Murther, with Theft, with Treaſon, Adulterie, and ſuch like; as hath beene before ſufficiently declared, and may further be prooued, if it were not a thing both knowne and confeſſed. To ſhut vp the poynt: certaine it is, that Peter neuer exerciſed any ſuch Iuriſdiction, eyther in part or whole, as here is claimed by the Popes: and if hee had it▪ and did not ſhew it eyther by doctrine or practice, he was not ſo carefull of the Church of God as hee ſhould bee, to hide from them ſo neceſſarie a truth: but if he had it not, then doe the Popes both vniuſtly deriue it from his chaire, and wrongfully vſurpe that which by no right belongeth vnto them. Now in that which I ſay Peter neuer did the like, let Paul and Iames and Iohn and all the reſt of the Apoſtles, yea, the whole Primitiue Church be included within the ſame propoſition, and it is as fully true as in that one particular: and therefore it muſt neceſſarily follow, that the Romiſh Iuriſdiction hath no footing nor founding in the whole Primitiue Church, but is like a Monſter borne out of time, deformed and miſſhapen in euery part thereof.

(Touching the aſſumption of Mary, wee leaue it to bee queſtioned.) Now this Councill was in the yeere 800. whereby it is euident, that all that time it was no publike ordination of the Church. The third was inſtituted by 
                     Ʋrbanus Sextus, which though Antoninus affirmeth, was neuer receiued nor kept, yet it was the inuention of a Pope, and that of no great antiquity. And indeed why ſhould it not bee obſerued, if the Pope cannot erre? or if it be not fit to bee obſerued, how is it true, that the Pope erreth not in defining matters of Religion? The fourth was ordained by Paulus the ſecond, anno 1466. as they themſelues will not deny.
               25. Beſides theſe of the Virgin Mary, they haue many other feſtiuall dayes, of the ſame nature and ſtampe: as the feaſt of Corpus Chriſti, of the inuention of the Croſſe, of the dedication of Churches, of All ſoules, and a number ſuch like: all which are confeſſed nouelties; for in the Apoſtles times and Primitiue Church, during the ſpace of foure hundred yeeres, none of theſe were once heard of.

                     •
                  ts of dedication of Churches grew

from a ſiniſter imitation of Conſtantine the great, who becauſeEuſeb. de vita Conſtant. l. 14 hee kept a ſolemne day at the dedication of a certain Church, which hee had built, therefore it was receiued as a Law, (for Princes actions are the peoples directions) to ſolemnize euery yeere a holy day vpon the day of the dedication of their Church. And all Soules was the deuice of one Saint Odyll, who as they write, in Cicilia, in the Ile of 
                     Ʋulcane, heard the voyces & howlings of Deuils, which complained with great griefe, that the ſoules of them that were dead, were taken awayLegenda aurea. out of their hands by almes and prayers: whereupon this feaſt was ordained, wherein prayer ſhould be made for al Soules. And as for this, ſo for the other, they deuiſed ſtrange miracles to win credit vnto them: which plainely argueth their nouelty, in that they ſtood in need of miracles to confirme them: as for example, touching the inuention of the holy Croſſe, they fable that it was firſt found in Paradiſe by Seth the ſon of Adam, to whom Michael the Angell gaue a branch of the forbidden tree, which hee planted vpon the graue of his Father Adam, which tree beeing after found by Salomon in mount Libanus, was tranſlated vnto his houſe, and there beeing worſhipped by the Queene of Saba, and foretold to bee the tree whereon the Sauiour of the world ſhould bee hanged, and by which Ieruſalem ſhould bee deſtroyed, was therefore taken downe, and buried deepe in the ground by Salomon: in which place afterward the Iewes diging a pit for a poole to water their cattell, found this tree, from which ſuch vertue aroſe to that poole, that the Angels deſcended to mooue the water, ſo that the firſt that bathed himſelfe therein after the motion, was healed of his diſeaſe whatſoeuer it was as wee read Iohn 5. Now vpon this tree was Chriſt crucified, which being afterward buried againe in the earth, was found out by Queene Helene the mother of Conſtantine, through the diſcouery of one Iudas a Iew, who was conuerted to the Chriſtian faith, by the ſweet ſauour that aroſe from the Croſſe, and the quaking of the earth: and then that Croſſe was diſcerned from the two other Croſſes of the theeues, by reſtoring life to a dead corps, whereupon it was

laide: and the Deuill cryed in the aire, that this Iudas had betrayed him as the other had done his Maſter Chriſt. By theſe ſtrange miracles they digniſy that holy feaſt, and indeed ſhew it to bee nothing els but a meere fable: and forſooth, all this they fetch out of the Goſpell of Nichodemus.
               
               27. So, for the dedication of Churches, they tell vs this miracle, that when a Church of the Arrians was hal owed by Chriſtian men, and the reliks of Saint Fabian, Saint Sebaſtian, & Saint Agathe brought into it, the people being aſſembled, heard ſuddenly the fearefull gronings & gruntings of an hog running vp and downe, inuiſibly, and ſeeking a paſſage out of the Church, and for three nights together,

                  g in the roofe with an hideous noiſe; which (ſay they) was nothing but the baniſhing of the Deuill out of that Church, by the hallowing and dedicating of it. Who would not then obſerue deuoutly this feaſt, ſeeing the benefit is ſo great, that commeth by the thing it ſelfe, whereof it is a memoriall? But let vs leaue theſe tables to their golden, or rather leaden Legend of lyes, as their owne Canus termeth it, and ſhut vp the point, that both theſe heere named, and a number ſuch like feſtiuall dayes, more preciſely honoured and obſerued in the Romiſh Church, and with greater deuotion t

Their dipping the conſecrated hoſte in the cup, Suarez another Ieſuite yeeldeth not to haue beene vſed by our Sauiour Chriſt, and therefore muſt needs bee an Innouation. Their putting the Sacrament not into the hands, but into the mouths of the communicants, the former Salmeron doth freely confeſſe to bee an action contrary to the firſt inſtitution. Laſtly, their various and ridiculous geſtures, murmuring, dopping, ſtaring, croſſing, &c. with the ſtrange garments vſed by the Prieſts, in the time of their adminiſtration. Six, of Prieſts in ſigne of perfection, becauſe in ſixe dayes God created Heauen and earth; nine for Biſhops, in token that they are ſpirituall, like the nine orders of Angels: and fifteene for both, in token of the fifteene degrees of Vertues: No man can bee ſo ſimple, but muſt needs ſee that they were neuer vſed by Chriſt himſelfe, or his Apoſtles, and therefore muſt of neceſſity be groſſe and palpable Innouations.
               29. From the Euchariſt, let vs looke backe to the ceremonies of Baptiſme: and firſt, to their baptizing of Bels, and of Gallies and Ships: ſecondly, exorciſme and exufflation: thirdly, anointing with oyle, and croſſing; and fourthly, ſalting and ſpittling; & laſtly, threefold Immerſion, or dipping the Infant:Alphonſ. de caſt. haereſ. l. 3 all which are palpable nouelties ſo confeſſed by the Romaniſts themſelues: neither can they euer ſhew that theſe ceremonies were either commanded by Chriſt, or practiſed by Iohn Baptiſt, or the Apoſtles: and though ſome of them, as the croſſe and anointing are of great antiquity, and were then and may bee ſtill lawfully vſed as things indifferent: yet in their Church, where ſuch an opinion of neceſſity is laid vpon them, that Baptiſme is not effectuall without them, they are meere Innouations, no wayes warranted by any antiquity.
               
                  30. Laſtly, I propound as their feaſting, ſo their faſting dayes, together with the manner of faſting vſed amongſt

               31. Secondly, their faſt of 4. times, cōmonly called Ember weekes, was firſt deuiſed by Pope Calixtus, as would witnes

Thirdly, their tying of faſts to certaine ſet dayes, as the fourth and ſixt day of the weeke, was not allowed in Saint Auguſtines time; for hee thus writeth againſt Vrbicus, thatAug. epiſt▪ 86 ſtroue for the Saturdayes faſt: I read in deed that wee are commanded to faſt, but which ought to bee the dayes of our faſting, I finde not preſcribed in the Euangelicall or Apoſtolicall writings: nor in his ſcholler Primaſius his age; for thus ſayth he, There

               32. Laſtly, their manner of faſting, which is, twice to refreſh their bodies on the faſting day at noone, by a ſmall dinner, and at night by a ſhort ſupper: Bellarmine himſelfe confeſſethBell. de bonis oper. in particul. l.

doth alſo giue diuers reaſōs of this mutatiō: As firſt, that thogh it bee tolerated in their Church, yet it is not commanded: Secondly, that thoſe cuſtomes which are not grounded vpon Gods word, may by eccleſiaſticall Lawes bee varyed according to the diuerſity of time & place: & thirdly, that when the ancients broke off their faſt at the ninth houre, they vſed to dyne at the ſixt, that is noone; and therefore when as many doe ordinarily dyne at the third houre, they may by like proportion breake off their faſt at the ſixt: theſe be Bellarmines reaſons to maintaine this Innouation: whereby we may both behold what ſilly props hee hath to vphold his rotten cauſe, and alſo that by his owne confeſſion this is a meere nouelty; and therefore he concludes, that notwithſtanding theſe forenamed reaſons, yet they doe better, who after the ancient cuſtome eate nothing till the ninth houre, and in Lent till the euening. And thus wee ſee how in the principall ceremonies of their Church, they haue degenerate from the vſage and cuſtome of all pure antiquity.
               33. Thus much of the outward face of their Church: Now let vs examine a little their doctrines, wherein they differ from vs, which are the ſinewes and nerues thereof: & here I might referre the Reader ouer vnto our learned and godly Countryman Doctour White, lately deceaſed, who in his high-way to the true Church, obiecteth eight points, wherein the moderne Church of Rome hath varyed from that which formerly was maintained: notwithſtanding I will alſo a little touch vpon the ſame ſtrings, adding ſomewhat more both in points and proofes, then is there deliuered▪ that the Reader may haue alſo heere ſome ſatisfaction concerning theſe matters.

                  Canus peremptorily affirmeth, that all the Fathers contradicted it. And it is to be noted, that whereas Bellarmine produceth twelue Fathers for the proofe thereof, not one of them doe directly affirme it, except one or two. Thirdly, becauſe the Elder Schoolemen with one conſent diſapprooued it, as Dominicus, Bannes, Turrecremata, Thomas Aquinas, Bonauenture and others, in ſo much that in this point they are driuen to this groſſe ſhift That yonger diuines are more apprehenſiue of truths, then were the more ancient Doctours. Bellarmine, I confeſſe, in this point accuſeth vs of ſlendering their doctrine, becauſe hee ſayth it was neuer held in their Church as an article of ſaith, as wee ſay it is: but by his leaue, if it was the decree of one Councill, though not confirmed by the Pope, as he ſaith the Councill of Baſill was not, and was allowed by another Councill confirmed by the Pope, to wit, the Councill of Trent, as an holy opinion, and agreeable to the Catholike faith, and approued by diuers Popes, as hee confeſſeth, and defended generally in their Church, not onely by doctrine, but by a ſolemne obſeruation of a feſtiuall day in memoriall thereof: then ſurely it cannot bee leſſe then an article of their faith: or if that terme miſlike him, a generall Romiſh opinion, which is enough for our purpoſe.
               35. Againe, it is another article of the Romiſh faith, that2. diuine ſeruice ſhould bee in the Latin tongue: this to be contrary to all antiquity, I haue already declared a little before, and therefore I thinke it not needfull here to repeate it; onely this is to bee marked, that till the Pope of Rome began to ſhew himſelfe to be Antichriſt, that man of ſinne, the myſtery

of whoſe name is the number 666. which according to Irenaeus coniecture is 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . Till then (I ſay) this Latine ſeruice was not publikely receiued, but euer ſince; as if the Pope would diſcouer himſelfe to bee that enemy, pointed at by

And further, that the Iewes inſtructed their children at fiue yeeres of age in the Scriptures, and therefore that Chriſtians might bee aſhamed to be careleſſe therein: and this (hee ſayth) was not onely his complaint, but the complaint of the ancient Fathers.

And Ierome perſwadeth not onely men, but women, to fly to the mountaines of the Scriptures, ſaying, that though there be none to teach them. yet their indeuour ſhall bee accepted of God: and in another place hee ſayth, that Plato wrote not to the people, but to a few, for ſcarſe three vnderſtand his workes: but Chriſt our Lord wrote by his Apoſtles, not to a few,
                  Orig. in Mat. 4. & contra Celſum. 
                  but to the whole people. Origen compareth the Scripture to Iacobs Well, wherein drinke not onely Iacob and his children, that is, the learned; but the ſheepe and oxen, that is, the rude and ſimple. Nazianzene affirmeth, that Chriſtians ought to read theNazian. hom. 4 Dom. Epiphan. Scriptures, or if through ignorance they cannot, then they muſt giue eare to others. Many other teſtimonies I could alledge; but theſe are I thinke ſufficient to ſhew, that in the age when theſe holy men liued, this doctrine was neuer hatcht, nor heard of, and therefore muſt needs bee an addle egge of a later layer.
               38. Thirdly, & laſtly, the manifold tranſlations of the Bibles into ſundry languages proueth the ſame; for to what end were they tranſlated, if they might not bee read? This Saint Auguſtine
                  Aug. de doctrin. Chriſt. l. 2. c. 5 affirmeth, when hee ſayth, that the holy Scripture proceeding from one tongue, beeing through the diuers tongues of interpreters, farre and wide diſperſed abroad, became knowne to the Gentiles to their ſaluation. And Theodoret as plainely. The

                  Hebrew bookes were tranſlated into all languages, which are at this day vſed in the world.

But they which ſpeake more remiſſely, ſay, that though it bee a poſitiue Law; yet it is Apoſtolicall, and therefore ought to bee obſerued in the Church, inuiolably; and the reaſon is giuen by Bellarmine;

In briefe, though in all ages the Deuill by his inſtruments laboured to bring diſgrace vpon Gods holy ordinance of marriage, and by that meanes to make way to adulteries, fornications, and vnlawfull luſts; and ſome learned and godly fathers were too lauiſh in commending virginity before marriage; yet they were alwayes gainſaide by other ſome as learned & godly as themſelues, whō God ſtirred vp for the deſence of his own ordinance: neither was it euer propounded as a Law, vntill Pope Siricius time, who was the firſt that forbad, and interdicted Prieſts to marry; and afterwards Pope Nicholas the firſt, or as ſome thinke, the ſecond, about the yeere 867, did the like; againſt whoſe proceedings Haldericus
                  
the Biſhop of Auſbrough, wrote that learned and pithy Epiſtle, where of mention is made before: and yet it was not vniuerſally receiued, vntill the time of Pope Calixtus, about the yeere 1108. Hiſtory is ſo cleare for this matter, that it admitteth no iuſt exception: and thus both by their owne confeſſions, and by the light of hiſtory, this doctrine is conuinced of nouelty.
               42. Another article of the Popes Creede is concerning Images,5. Concil. Trid. ſeſſ. 25. Bell, de Imag. l. 2 Azor. Inſtit. mor. Ʋaſques.

                  tternes: or at leaſt wiſe that they are to be worſhipped in or at the Image: This is the generall doctrine of that Idolatrous Church: which that it hath no true warrant from antiquity, is ſo cleare, that none that is but meanely ſeene in ancient writers, can doubt thereof. For firſt, in the Church of the Iewes it was vnlawfull either to make any Image of God, beeing an inuiſible, and incomprehenſible eſſence, or to worſhip the Image of any other thing whatſoeuer: this was the preſcript of the ſecond Commandement, which was no ceremoniall Law: As Azorius and Vaſques, twoAzor.

                     Ʋarro, alledged by Saint Auguſtine in his fourth book de Ciuitate: who ſayth, that the Iewiſh nation worſhipped God without any Image, & that they had no Image in the Temple ordained for worſhip. Alſo Ioſephus doth write, that when Caius the Emperour would haue cauſed his ſtatue to haue been ſet vp by Petroni
                        •
                     s to be worſhipped in the Temple of Ieruſalem, the Iewes had rather expoſe themſelues to preſent death, then to admit that which was forbidden by the Law.
               43 Secondly, in the age of Ieſus Chriſt, and the Apoſtles, there was no precept nor example for the worſhipping of Images, nei. her did they commend vnto the Lay people Images and Pictures, as fitteſt bookes for their capacities, but the word preached and committed to writing, by which they

ſhould bee brought to ſaluation. And when as they aboliſhed the worſhip of Idols, and brought in the worſhip of the true God, wee doe not read, that either they tranſlated thoſe Idolatrous ſtatues to the worſhip of the true God, or ſubſtituted other Images of God himſelfe, for of holy men to ſucceed in their roome; but taught that God who is a Spirit, ought to bee worſhipped in Spirit and truth. Now ſurely if it had beene ſo neceſſary as the Church of Rome maketh it, our Sauiour Chriſt and his Apoſtles would neuer haue concealed it from them.
               44. Thirdly, the age alſo after the Apoſtles, was free from Images: for amongſt thoſe Eccleſiaſticall rites, which are recorded to haue been vſed in the firſt 300. yeeres after Chriſt, there is not ſo much as any mention made of Image-worship,Theodor. de haereſ. l. 1. except it bee amongſt thoſe that were condemned for Heretikes: as the followers of Simon Magus, who worſhipped his Image, and of his harlot Selene; and the Diſciples of Baſilides, whom Irenaeus affirmeth to haue vſed Images, andIren. l. 1. c. 23. Inuocations: and the Carpocratians, and Gnoſticks, who burned incenſe to the Images of Chriſt and Paul, Homer and Pithagoras, &c. as teſtifyeth Saint Auguſtine: but the trueAug. de haereſ. Church of God condemned theſe, and abhorred all ſuch kind of worſhip; and therefore amongſt the accuſations which the Heathen obiected to Chriſtians in that age, this was one, that they profeſſed a Religion without Images, as witneſſe both Clemens Alexandrinus, and Origen; the one whereof liuedClem. Alexand. ſtrom. l 6. Origen. contra Celſum. 200. yeeres after Chriſt, and the other 240. which trueth their Caſſander confeſſeth in direct words, that at the firſt preaching of the Goſpell, there was no publike vſe of Images in the Church.
               
               45. Fourthly, in the next age of the Church, after the three hundreth yeere that Images were not approued, wee haue the witneſſe of the Councill of Eliberis, which decreedConcil. El. ber.

of Epiphanius, who finding a painted Image in a Church, rent it
                  Epiphan. epiſt. ad Ioan. 
                  downe, and ſaid that it was againſt the authority of the Scripture, that any Image ſhould bee in the Church: and of Auguſtine, whoAug in Pſal. 114 & epiſt. 119.

                      Caſſand. conſult. art. 21. condemned the vſe of them in Churches as vnlawfull: and laſtly, of Gregory their owne Pope, who allowing onely an hiſtoricall vſe of them, forbad them to bee worſhipped: as teſtifieth Agrippa. Indeed wee confeſſe that there was in theſeAgrip. de vanit. c. 70. Primitiue times of the Church, an hiſtoricall vſe of Images: as may appeare by that ſtatue of our Sauiour at Ceſarea, mentioned by Euſebius: and the Pictures of Peter and Paul in theEuſeb. l 7. c. 14. ſame author: and of the good ſhepheard ſeeking the loſt ſheepe, painted vpon their Chalices, in Tertullian. But weeTertul. lib. de pudicitia. ſhall neuer finde in any good author, that either they were receiued into Churches, or worſhipped in any religious manner.
               46. Laſtly, it is a knowne and confeſſed truth, that Images were neuer generally receiued & inioyned vpon the Church, vntill the ſecond Nicene Council which was eight hundreth yeeres after Chriſt: and alſo that the decree of that Councill was abrogated by another Councill held at Frankeford, not long after; ſo that it is manifeſt, that the petigree of this baſtard is of no great continuance, not fetched from the Primitiue Church, which is the thing we haue in hand to prooue, but ſpringing vp in the more corrupt times, when ſuperſtition had darkned the light of true Religion, and almoſt baniſhed it out of the world.
               47. Another article of their Religion is, that the Pope hath6. a ſupremacy of power ouer all, euen Princes, not onely in ſpirituall matters, but euen in temporall: which to bee a late deuice, not warrantable by true antiquity, may be eaſily demonſtrated. For vpon thoſe words of Saint Paul, Let euery ſoule

                  bee ſubiect to the higher powers. Chryſoſtome and Occumenius write thus: That whether it bee a Prieſt, or a Monke, or an Apoſtle, hee muſt bee ſubiect to the ciuill Magiſtrate: for this ſubiection doth not ouerthrow piety: and if an Apoſtle, then the Pope: as Aeneas Siluius who was after a Pope himſelfe, inferreth: yea Eſpenſaeus goeth further, and ſayth, that not onely Chryſoſtome,
                  
but Theodoret, Theophilact, and all the Greeke Doctours: and in the Latine Church, Saint Gregory, and Saint Bernard did from that place teach, that eueryl Apoſtle, and Prophet, and Prieſt, was commanded to acknowledge ſubiection vnto Emperours. Saint Ambroſe ſayth plainely, thatAmbroſ. orat in Auent. Aug. confeſſ. l. 3. c. 8. the Church lands, and Church men themſelues did pay tribute to the Emperour; and if tribute, then ſubiection: Saint Auguſtine ſayth, that it is generale pactum ſocietatis humanae, abedire Regibus ſuis: The generall couenant and bond of humane ſocietie, to obey Kings. If the Pope then bee a man, by Saint Auguſtines
                  Gregor. l. 2. Indict. 11. c. 100. rule, hee muſt bee ſubiect: yea Gregory the firſt himſelfe auoucheth plainely, that power ouer all men is committed by GOD, Dominorum meorum pietati, to the piety of my Lords: where hee not onely ſubiecteth all, none excepted to the Imperiall power: but alſo calleth the Emperour his Lord: but now the Pope is the Emperours Lord, and not the EmperourBell. de Cleric. c. 28. the Popes, as Bellarmine ſpeaketh without bluſhing, when he ſayth, Non ſunt ampliùs Reges Clericorum ſuperiores, &c. Kings are not any longer ſuperiours to Clerks: and therefore Clerks are not bound to obey them by Gods Law: and thus in generall, the Pope had not this ſupremacy, till Gregories time.
               48. For particulars, one part of this ſupremacy is, that the Pope is abſolutely aboue a Councill, which notwithſtandingCuſan. l. 2 concord. c. 17. was condemned by the Councils of Conſtance, and Baſill. And as Cardinall Cuſanus confeſſeth, was not acknowledged in the dayes of Saint Auguſtine: Pope Gregory, and other Fathers and Councils, which liued before the firſt ſix hundreth yeere. Another part is, that appeales ſhould bee made to the Pope from all places, which the Councils of Chalcedon, Africke, Mileri, and Conſtantinople vtterly withſtood and interdicted. A third is, that peculiar caſes of conſcience ſhould bee reſerued to the Popes conſiſtory, which their owne Salmeran confeſſethSalmer. in 1.

Laſtly, a ſeuenth, the fountaine of Epiſcopall Iuriſdiction, challenged to reſide in the Pope alone, and from him to bee imparted to other Biſhops at his pleaſure, which was a doctrine not known in Saint Cyprians time, nor in Saint Ieromes as hath beene ſhewed before. In a word there is no colour of antiquity for any part of this tranſcendent Iuriſdiction, and yet the very ſoule and life of Popery conſiſteth therein.

For ſchoolmen, Durand, Biell, Caietane, doe with one conſent auouch, that all without exception, were to drinke of the cup; becauſe God is no reſpecter of perſons, and that this cuſtome of communicating with both kindes, indured long in the Church. And whereas Thomas Aquinas ſayth, that to auoid irreuerence it is wiſely obſerued in certaine Churches, that the blood ſhould not be receiued of the people, but of the Prieſts onely. It is to bee marked, firſt, that hee ſayth in certaine Churches, by which he confeſſeth, that it was not vniuerſally receiued in his dayes: and ſecondly, that it is wiſely obſerued, by which hee inſinuates, that before time it was not obſerued, but indiſcreetly neglected.
               50. Laſtly, for the Fathers, it would bee too tedious to recite all their teſtimonies, onely therefore I referre the Reader to the places quoted in the margent; or if he deſire to behold at one view all their opinions, to Pleſſeis firſt booke, & tenth Chapter of the Maſſe, where he ſhall finde a whole catalogue of them: I will content my ſelfe with one onely ſaying of Chryſoſtome, in his eighteenth Homily, vpon the firſt to the

Corinthians, hee thus writeth: Sometime there is no difference

                  betwixt the Prieſt and the people, as to wit, at the receiuing of the ſacred myſteries; for all are admitted to them alike: for though in the old Teſtament it was not lawfull for the people to eat of the ſame things with the Prieſts: yet the matter is otherwiſe now: for one body, and one cup is propounded vnto all. This doctrine therefore is an Innouation by the iudgement of all theſe.
               51. Tranſubſtantiation commeth in the next place, which8. though they labour tooth and naile to procue to bee of great antiquity; yet we haue the teſtimony of Scotus, of Tonſtall,

Tranſubſtantiation was no doctrine of faith, and that it was free for all men, till that time to follow their owne coniecture, as concerning the manner of of the preſence. Lumbard alſo ſayth, that he is not able to define what manner of conuerſion is in the Sacrament: and Bellarmine himſelfe confeſſeth, that the name tranſubſtantiation, was firſt found out, and brought into the world by the Laterane Councill: though hee labour to proue that the thing it ſelfe was beleeued long before. And thus howſoeuer this baſtard Babe was borne before, yet it is not denyed but that it was then Chriſtened.
               52. And how long before was it borne I pray you? Marry Bellarmine alledgeth two Councils, both held at Rome; one vnder Nicholas the ſecond: the other vnder Gregory the ſeuenth: in both which Berengarius was conſtrained to abiure his hereſie (as he calleth it) and to ſubſcribe to this article, that the bread and wine after conſecration, are changed into the very body and blood of Chriſt: but concerning the Councill, vnder Gregory the ſeuenth, wee haue iuſt cauſes to doubt whether there were any ſuch or no: firſt, becauſe the acts ofSurius. tom. concil. 3.

Bell. de Euchar. l. 2. c. 2. it are no where to bee ſound; and ſecondly, becauſe the ſame Pope Gregory is reported by Cardinall Benno, to haue doubted, whether the opinion of Berengarius, or of the Church of Rome were more ſound: And for the other Councill vnder Nicholas the ſecond, Bellarmine himſelfe confeſſeth, that Berengarius was conſtrained onely to confeſſe the reall preſence

and not tranſubſtantiation, and ſo indeed in both of them, not the manner of the preſence, which is tranſubſtantiation, but the realty thereof was in queſtion: But let it be granted that it was decreed in theſe two Councils, yet the antiquity is not very great, for the eldeſt of them was but in the yeere, 1059.
               53. As for the opiniō of the Church, from the firſtage of it, vntill theſe times, thogh Bellarmine produceth many teſtimoniesSee Doctour Morton Proteſtant appeale, l. 2. c. 2. See Doctour white, pag. 347. of the Fathers, yet either they are counterfeit, or little to the purpoſe, or at leaſt wiſe miſapplied & vnderſtood: whereas the teſtimonies of the ſame Fathers, & others produced by vs againſt this doctrine, are ſo plaine, direct and peremptory, that by no ſound reaſon they can be auoided. I may not ouerburden the Reader with a repetition of them, they may finde thē els-where at large diſcourſed: ſo that thogh the iuſt time cannot bee aſſigned when this errour ſprung in the Church: yet it is a nouell doctrine, borne ſince the purer times of the Goſpell, and growing in ſtature and ſtrength till the Laterane Councill, and then taking it name and full perfection.
               54. Their priuate Maſſes may be ranked in the next place,9. I meane ſuch priuate Maſſes, wherein the Prieſt alone doth participate the Sacrament without the people. This is a doctrine and practice in the Church of Rome, as may appeareConcil Trid. ſeſſ. 6. c. 6. can. 8. Bell. de iniſſa. l. 2. c. 9. both in the Councill of Trent, where it is approoued for Catholike and lawfull: and in Bellarmine, and others, which haue their mouthes full of arguments to defend the ſame: but I will not meddle with their arguments, onely my taske is to prooue it to bee a nouelty; which I may well doe by theſe three reaſons: Firſt, becauſe it is contrary to our Sauiours firſt inſtitution: Secondly, to the writing and practiſing of the Apoſtles: and thirdly, to the example of the Primitiue Church. That it is contrary to Chriſts firſt inſtitution, it is euident, becauſe Chriſt at his laſt Supper did not take the bread and wine alone, his Apoſtles beholding, and looking on, and conſecrate them, and ſo eat and drinke them himſelfe, but gaue both the Elements vnto them all, and bade them eat and

drinke them in remembrance of him: this was the firſt inſtitution of the Sacrament, which ought to be a patterne to the Church of God for euer. But Bellarmine ſayth, that it was butBell. de miſſa. l. 2. c. 10. an affirmatiue precept of our Sauiour, & therefore did bind no further then the circumſtance of time, place and perſon would permit; and that to communicate in the Sacrament, was no eſſentiall part thereof; and therefore might bee omitted vpon occaſion. To which I anſwere, that though it bee falſe which hee ſayth, touching communicating in the Sacrament, that it is no eſſentiall part thereof: for the contrary may be prooued both by Scripture, which calleth the whole Sacrament a Communion, 1. Cor. 10. and by analogy of the Paſſeouer in the Law, which was to bee eaten of all: & by the confeſſion of their owne learned Schooleman Gabriel Piel, who ſayth,Gabriel Biel. in Canon. lect. 26. tit. 
                        •
                     . that the conſecration in the Euchariſt is ordained for the vſe, which is, the eating of it, as vnto the next end after a ſort: yet it is ſufficient for our purpoſe, that he confeſſeth that it is a variation from the firſt inſtitution, and therefore without queſtion an Innouation.
               55. Secondly, that it is contrary to the doctrine and practice of the Apoſtles, appeareth by this, becauſe the Apoſtle Saint Paul ſometimes calleth the miniſtration of the Sacrament, a breaking of bread, and that through houſholds. By whichActs 2. 46. is neceſſarily inſinuated a diſtribution and diſpenſation of it1. Cor. 10. 16. to others, beſides the Prieſt: Sometimes the communion or communication of the body and blood of Chriſt. Yea the Apoſtle ſayth plainly, that wee that are many, are one bread, and one body; becauſe wee are partakers of one bread; but if it bee priuate, then there is no communion, neither are there many, and neither is the bread which is made of many graines of corne, nor the wine cruſhed out of many grapes, a repreſentation of the myſticall body of Chriſt, (as all diuines confeſſe) aſwell as of the naturall: if there bee no myſticall body, that is, no Congregation to participate. Laſtly, Chryſoſtome writingBiel. ibidem. vpon 1. Cor. 11. ſayth, that this was the fault which the Apoſtle blameth in the Corinthians, becauſe they made that

priuate which was the Lords: for the Supper of the Lord (ſayth hee) ought to bee common.
               56. Thirdly, what the example of the Primitiue Church was after the Apoſtles, the ancient Lyturgies then in vſe doe declare: in none of which can wee finde any colour for this practice: which euidence cauſed iudicious Caſſander to confeſſeCaſſand. conſult. art. 24. that ſolitary Maſſes are moſt manifeſtly confuted by the ancient Greeke Lyturgies: and that which hee ſayth of the Greeke, may bee iuſtly auerred of all the other ancient miſſals, that were in vſe of the Church, and are extant in the writings of the Fathers, as Chryſoſtomes, Ambroſes, Gregories, and ſuch like: yea the Canon of the Romiſh maſſe it ſelfe is againſt this errour: for it is ſaid there: As many of vs haue beene partakers: and Bleſſe O Lord theſe Sacraments to vs, which wee haue receiued. Now how can this bee ſaid without mockage, when there is none preſent but the Prieſt.
               57. But beſides thoſe Lyturgies, wee haue the plaine teſtimonies of ancient Fathers: one Chryſoſtome for breuities ſakeChryſoſt. hom. 3. in Epheſ. c. 1. ſhall ſtand inſteed of all: hee thus propoundeth the cuſtome of the Church in his time: The dayly oblation (ſayth he) is made in vaine, when there is none to participate: and again, Whoſoeuer is not partaker of the myſteries, ſtand by as a fooliſh and wicked man. This is flat contrary to the Romiſh practice, where the Prieſt maſſeth alone, & the people kneele, by knocking, their breſts, and lifting vp their eyes to their breaden God: you ſee then there was no ſuch cuſtome in Chryſoſtomes time: and this further may bee confirmed by the tenth Canon of thoſe that are called Apoſtolicall, which doth forbid any to be preſent, but ſuch as doe communicate; ſaying, that they are diſturbers of the order of the Church: the ſame Canon alſo isBell. de miſſ. l. 2. c. 10.

in expreſſe words to affirme this practice to bee a nouelty, not inſtituted by Chriſt, nor vſed either in the Apoſtles times, or in the Primitiue Church.
               58. The next point may bee touching the ſacrifice in the10
                        •
                     
                   Maſſe, for they teach, that there is offered vp by the Prieſt a true reall propitiatory ſacrifice for the quick and the dead: this is the direct doctrine of the Romiſh Church, canonized in the Councill of Trent: which doctrine how true it is, I willConcil. Trid. ſeſſ. 6. can. 3
                        •
                     
                   not diſpute, onely I am to ſhew how new it is, which may appeare: firſt, in that throughout all the new Teſtament, where there is any mentiō made of the Lords ſupper, there is not one word ſpoken of a ſacrifice: for neither doth our Sauiour himſelfe ſay, that hee offered a ſacrifice, when he firſt inſtituted it, neither doth Saint Paul call it by that name, when hee deliuers the full doctrine thereof to the Corinthians: neither doth Saint Luke affirme, that the Apoſtles offered a ſacrifice, when they put it in practice; but onely that they broke bread from houſe to houſe: now if this had beene ſo eſſentiall a part of the Euchariſt, as the Romaniſts make it, yea if it had beene any part at all, our Sauiour Chriſt and his Apoſtles, would neuer haue concealed it from the Church.
               59. If they obiect, that though a ſacrifice bee not mentioned, yet it was acted both becauſe Melchizedek was a type of Chriſt, and he offered bread and wine, and alſo becauſe theſe words, Hoc facite, Doe this: aſmuch as Sacrificate, ſacrifice: I anſwere, that neither did Melchizedek offer bread and wine; but brought it foorth onely to the refreſhing of Abraham, and his fellowers; as the Chaldy Paraphraſe, the Greeke interpretours. Ioſephus, Cyprian, and Chryſoſtome doe interpret the place; and the words themſelues in the originall, doe import: neither doth the verbe facere ſignifie to ſacrifice in that place, ſeeing as euery ſchoole-boy knoweth, then it ſhould bee conſtrued with an Ablatiue, and not with an Accuſatiue caſe, as heere it is: and this they themſelues doe euidently prooue, when they cannot agree among themſelues, in which action of the Sacrament conſiſteth the eſſence, and perfection of this ſacrifice: whether in the eleuation, which

                  Sotus thought to belong vnto it: or in the conſecration, as Suares; or in the oblation, as Ecchius; or in the intinction, as Canus; or in the diſpenſation and diſtribution, as others; or in the conſumption, as Bellarmine, and Ledeſima: and ſo they know not where to fixe the center thereof, hauing indeed no footing in the whole circle of our Sauiours example.
               60. And as for the word

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   
                  Heb. 1. which ſome of them are not aſhamed to ſay they doe: but I beleeue it all alike, as I doe that tale in their Legend of Bees, ſinging Maſſe in their Hyue about the hoſte, put in by 2 woman, to make her ſwarmes to thriue. Againe, of the like nature is that fond concluſion of Genebrard, who becauſe by
                     Genebrard. in Lyturg. Apoſtol. c. 7. Leuit. 23. 16. the Leuitical Law God cōmanded Cakes of new corne to be offered vpō the day of Pentecoſt, which is there called, A new offering: therefore the Apoſtles ſung the firſt Maſſe vpon that great day of Pentecoſt, Act. 2. and that Iames being Biſhop of Hieruſalem, was the chiefe actour therein. This is ſo groſſe, that it needs no refutation; and it ſheweth plainely the point I ayme at, that there is no colour for their Maſſe in the new Teſtament, ſeeing they are conſtrained to fetch it out of the old, eſpecially by ſo ridiculous and ſtrange a deduction.
               61. Secondly, if wee conſult with the primitiue and pure antiquity, wee ſhall neuer finde any iuſt teſtimony for the Romiſh propitiatory ſacrifice, for the expiating, and purging away of ſinnes: for albeit the Fathers doe often call this Sacrament a ſacrifice, yet their meaning is not that it is a true, proper, and reall ſacrifice, but onely either a commemoration, and repreſentation of the ſacrifice of Chriſt, finiſhed on the Croſſe, or an application, and obſignation of the ſame to the faithfull receiuers: which to bee their intendment, may

be gathered, firſt, from their owne teſtimonies, which are ſo cleare and direct, that I ſhall not need, ſaue to referre the Reader to the places quoted in the margent. And ſecondly, byChryſoſt. hom 17 ad Heb

And thirdly, by their conſtant aſcription to the ſole ſacrifice of Chriſt, the onely power of propitiation and ſatisfaction for ſinnes: which if it be true, then when they call the Maſſe, A propitiatory ſacrifice, they muſt of neceſſity vnderſtand not a reall ſacrifice, but onely a repreſentation, and application of that onely true ſacrifice on the Croſſe, beſides which there is no other externall and corporall ſacrifice inLactant. epitom. diumor.

               62. Laſtly, if it bee granted, that many of the ancients did ſpeake of a proper and true ſacrifice, yet the theatricall pageant of the Romiſh Maſſe cannot bee vnderſtood by them, both becauſe in the ancient deſcription of the rites and orders of the Church, found in Iuſtine Martyr, Dionyſius, Chryſoſtome,

               63. The fire of Romiſh Purgatory is a bird of the ſame11. feather, it was neither kindled in the Scriptures, neither is it found in ancient Councils, or in the writers of the Primitiue Church: nor yet in thoſe that next ſucceeded the age therof. I vnderſtand here Romiſh Purgatory, to wit, ſuch as is taught

& maintained in the Church of Rome at this day, as an article

               64. Concerning this Purgatory, if wee conſult with the places of the ſcripture, alledged by them for the maintenance thereof, wee ſhall find them either friuolouſly, or falſly produced: for either they are allegories, which can affoord no ſtrong concluſion in reaſoning: or they are vtterly of another ſenſe, except they bee wrung and ſtretched beyond their

                  ether, which to bee true may appeare; Firſt, becauſe none of them directly ſay, that there is a Purgatory: ſecondly, the conſequence extracted from thē, is of ſo ambiguous an Interpretation, that if one interpreter conceiue them that way, two are of a contrary iudgment: thirdly, becauſe they croſſe one another

               66. Laſtly, concerning the Fathers it cannot bee denyed, but that many of them ſpeake of a purging fire: but it is to be obſerued in them, that they moſt of them, intended not theHeb. cap. 6. Romiſh Purgatory; but the fire of the day of Doome, as the teſtimonies of Baſill, Ambroſe, Hilary, Origen, Lactantius, and Ierome, all alledged by Bellarmine doe euince, if wee will either examine them, by the contexts of the places themſelues, or giue credit to their owne Doctors, ſo expounding them; or
                     
                        Ʋide Doctour Morton Proteſtant appeale, l. 1. c. 2. pag. 17. to Bellarmine himſelfe, who in diuers places croſſeth himſelfe, and yeeldeth aſmuch as wee auouch: Beſides it is to bee obſerued, that many of the Fathers ſuppoſed that the Saints departed, did neither receiue reward nor puniſhment till the laſt day, but were kept in certaine hidden receptacles till that time: and therefore they could not dreame of Purgatory, which is an intermediall puniſhment, ending at the day of iudgement. Of this opinion were Irenaeus, Iuſtine Martyr, Tertullian, Origen, Lactantius, Clements, & many others of the greateſt ancients. Againe, it is to bee obſerued, that Auguſtine, whom they challenge for the greateſt patrone of this fire, yet defineth nothing determinately of it, but ſpeaketh doubtingly, and problematically; and if he affirme it in ſome one place, he leaueth it in ſuſpenſe in others, and vtterly denyeth it in a third: as for example, in his Enchiriden he ſpeaketh10. Aug. Enchir. c. 69. Idem de verbis Apoſt. ſerm. 18. thus waueringly: Such a thing is not incredible to bee after this life, but whether it be or no, it may be doubted: and in a ſermon hee ſeemeth vtterly to deny it, when hee ſayth: There are two places, and there is not a third, we are ignorant of a third, yea we finde in the Scripture that there is none ſuch. Againe, it

is to bee obſerued, that thoſe Fathers which doe patronize this Purgatory, yet propound it not as an article of faith, but as a free opinion to bee receiued or contradicted, as men thought good, or ſaw reaſon; and theſe alſo were none of the moſt ancient: For Bellarmine climmeth no higher for it, then to Athanaſius Baſill, and Gregory Nazianzene: for as for Dyoniſius, all knew him to bee a counterfeit; but thoſe liued after the age of the Primitiue Church: as for thoſe Fathers which liued in thoſe purer times, there is not a ſillable found in them for the defence thereof. Laſtly, it is not to bee forgotten, that their owne Roffenſis doth auerre, that whoſeeuer

                   ſhall read the Greeke Fathers, ſhall finde none, or very rare mention of Purgatory; and that all the Latine Fathers, did not at the firſt apprehend it: and that it was not a long time vniuerſally beleeued in the Church, but came in by little and little. Theſe things laide together, doe demonſtratiuely ſhew, that Romiſh Purgatory, was not an article of faith in the Primitiue Church, but a late deuice, brought in by a vaine feare, and falſe and lying apparitions, and maintained euer after by the ſmell of gaine and profit, which 
                     •
                  accreweth thereby to the Popes purſe, and for the maintenance of his pompe and pride, which otherwiſe would ſoone fall to the ground.
               67. Laſtly, to tye vp for breuities ſake many points in one12. bundle, prayer for the dead, as it is vſed in the Church of Rome, hath no ground of antiquity: For though it cannot be denyed, but that it hath beene an ancient cuſtome in the Church, and frequently vſed by the ancient Farthers, yet their manner of praying was not of that nature, as it is now in the Romiſh Synagogue: For firſt the Ancients prayed for thoſe whom they were perſwaded to bee already in bliſſe, as hath beene formerly declared: but the Romaniſts ſay, that ſuchBell. de Purgat. l. 2. c. 18. prayers are auaileable onely for ſoules tormented in the fire of Purgatory, and that wee may not pray either for the bleſſed, or the damned. Secondly, many of the Ancients ſuppoſe that all ſoules were reſerued in a certaine ſecret place, from the preſence of God, which they called Abrahams boſome,

Paradiſe, the port of ſecurity, the outward court of Heauen, &c. And therefore could not pray for their deliuerance from Purgatory, as the Romaniſts doe. Thirdly, when the Ancients did pray for the Saints departed, they did it (as Bellarmine
                  Ibidem. confeſſeth) not in regard of any miſery wherein their ſoules were, but for the glorifying of their bodies in the day of the generall reſurrection: but the Romiſh prayers are onely for thoſe that are in paines, that they might bee deliuered. Laſtly, the Ancients ſpeake of the matter doubtfully; as SaintAug. de ciuitat. l. 21. c. 27. 
                  Auguſtine, with a peraduenture, and as of a laudable cuſtome receiued in the Church, but not as a doctrine of abſolute neceſſity: but the Romaniſts obtrude it as an article of faith, and call them Heretikes that deny the ſame: and therefore though in generall, prayer for the dead bee ancient, yet Romiſh prayer is an Innouation declining from antiquity, both in the obiect and ſubiect, manner and end.
               68. So auricular confeſſion is of like nature with the former:13. For we confeſſe that confeſſion was ancient, but Auricular Romiſh confeſſion is but a late vpſtart, both in reſpect of the abſolute neceſſity of it, which was brought in by Pope Innocent the third, beeing before accounted but onely profitable, and not neceſſary, as in the Councill of Cabilon: ſecondly,

Tim. 4. 14. and 2. Tim. 1. 6. where Timothy is charged and admoniſhed, not to neglect, but to ſtir vp the grace that was in him, which was giuen to him by prophecy, with the impoſition of hands of the Elderſhip. Here indeed is grace giuen to Timothy at his ordination: but firſt, it could not bee ſauing grace, becauſe hee was before that conuerted, and beleeued, as it appeareth, Acts 16. but rather is to bee thought to bee the extraordinary gift of the holy Ghoſt, as Saint Paul plainly inſinuateth, 2. Tim. 1. And ſecondly, though it ſhould bee ſauing grace, yet it is not promiſed to all others, though it

were then giuen to Timotheus, neither were all that receiued holy orders, partakers thereof: for then Nicholas the Deacon ſhould haue beene ſanctified being an hypocrite. Who ſeeth no

               71. Laſt of all, their doctrine, touching merite of workes, may bee branded with the ſame marke. For firſt, though the word merite bee often vſed by the Fathers, yet ordinarily it is not taken in that ſenſe, which the Romaniſts vſe it in, as witneſſe both Bellarmine, and 
                     Ʋiega, and Stapleton: and if they did not, yet manifold examples out of their owne writings, would prooue to be true: Secondly, the full ſtreame of their doctrine doth make againſt the proud conceit of merite: for they aſcribe all to Gods mercy, and Chriſts merits, eſteeming

their owne beſt workings and ſufferings, vnworthy of the euerlaſtingCyprian martyr. Hieronym. eteſiph. Gregor. l 1. hom. 11. ſuper Ezech. Bernard. epiſt. 310. and celeſtiall reward: they neuer dreamt of that ambitious doctrine, taught in the Church of Rome, that our good workes are abſolutely good, and truely, and properly meritorious, and fully worthy of eternall life. Let their books be viewed, and nothing can bee more apparantly cleare then this is. Thirdly, the termes of congruity, and condignity, were deuiſed but of late dayes, by the ſubtill Schoolemen, who notwithſtanding could not agree among themſelues, touching the true definition & diſtinctiō of their own books, by whichViega de meritis, q 7. pag. 816. Bell. de iuſtif. lib. 2. cap. 1. Waldenſis ſacramental. tit. 1. c. 7 it appeareth, that it was not then any Catholike or vniuerſall truth. Laſtly, their owne Doctours terme the merite of congruity, a new inuention, and that other of condignity, no Catholike nor ancient doctrine, and the whole doctrine of meriting, to haue beene firſt made an article of faith, by the Councill of Trent: all which laide together, prooue it moſt clearely to bee of no great ſtanding, nor they of any vnderſtanding that were the firſt forgers and deuiſers thereof.
               72. Thus wee haue ſixteene points, wherein the new RomiſhConcluſion. Religion hath degenerated from all pure antiquity, to which many more might bee added, but theſe are ſufficient to euince our concluſion, which is this, that ſeeing the Romiſh Church hath neither in matter nor forme, ſubſtance nor accidents, any ſure ground, either from Scripture, or the doctrine of the Primitiue Church; but is vtterly vnlike to it in many ſubſtantiall reſpects; therefore it cannot bee the true Church of God, but an harlot in her ſtead: and their Religion not of God, but of men; and conſequently, that wee in declining from them, and conforming our ſelues, both in doctrine and manners, to the Primitiue patterne, are not fallen from the Church, but to the Church, and that theirs is the new Religion, and not ours. And thus wee ſee what all their bragges and clamours, touching the antiquity of their Religion, and the nouelty of ours come vnto; ſeeing there is no one thing more pregnant, to prooue the falſhood of their Religion, and the Apoſtacy, and Antichriſtianity of their Church, then this is. And to conclude, as wee would thinke him not well in his

wits, that hauing beene long ſicke, and after regained health, ſhould ſay, that ſicknes was more ancient then health, whereas he ſhould rather ſay, that hee had recouered his old health, & that his new Inmate ſickneſſe was diſpoſſeſſed of his lodging, though it had kept it long; ſo in all reaſon it is madneſſe to thinke the reformation of the Church, and reducing of Chriſtian Religion to the ancient health to bee more nouell and new, then the horrible ſickneſſe and apoſtacy, wherewith it was long, not onely infected, but almoſt ouer-whelmed. And this is iuſt our caſe with the Church of Rome, but I leaue them to bee healed by the heauenly Phiſitian himſelfe, Ieſus Chriſt our Sauiour, whoſe wholeſome Phyſicke muſt cure them, or nothing will.
            
            
               
                  MOTIVE XII. ¶ That Church which maintaineth it ſelfe, and the Religion profeſſed by it, and ſeeketh to diſaduantage the aduerſaries by vnlawfull vniuſt, and vngodly meanes, cannot bee the true Church of God, nor that Religion the truth of God, by the grounds whereof they are warranted to act ſuch deuiliſh practices: but ſuch is the practice of the Romiſt Church, and therfore neither their Church, nor their Religion can be of God.
               IT is a wonder to ſee what deuiſes, ſleights, impoſtures, and deuiliſh practices the Romaniſts haue, and now at this day doe more then euer vſe, to vphold their rotten Religion, & to enſnare mens minds with the forlorne ſuperſtitiō, their kingdome being ready to fall, they care not with what props they vnder-ſhore it, and the truth preuailing againſt them, they care not with what engines, though fetched from hell it ſelfe, they vndermine it, ſo that they may any wayes batter the walles, or ſhake the foundation thereof. My purpoſe is in this Chapter to diſcouer ſome of the Sathanicall practices of theſe ſubtle Enginers, I meane, the Ieſuites and Prieſts, and

other rabble of Romiſh proctors: It is not poſſible to reckon them vp all, being ſo many and various: ſuch therefore (God willing) ſhall be heere diſcouered, as are for villany moſt notorious, for impudency moſt ſhameleſſe, and for certainty moſt perſpicuous; and by them let the Chriſtian Reader that loueth the truth, iudge of their Religion and Church, what it is.
               2. The firſt propoſition of this argument is grounded vponMaior. three principles▪ one of nature, another of reaſon, the third of Scripture: nature teacheth, that contraries are cured, that is, expelled by contraries, as hot diſeaſes by cold medicines, and cold by hot, light by darkeneſſe, and darkeneſſe by light. Now trueth and falſhood, good and euill, godlineſſe, and vngodlineſſe, are thus contrary; and therefore naturally expelling each other, they cannot bee meanes of each others preſeruation: that cannot then bee the trueth, which ſecketh to with-hold it ſelfe by falſhood, nor true Religion, which is a doctrine according to godlineſſe, which maintaineth it ſelfe by vniuſt, vngodly and wicked practices: this is natures voyce, to which reaſon ſubſcribeth, when it concludeth, that it is not onely improbable, but impoſſible that Vertue ſhould ſeeke for Vices helpe, to fortifie it ſelfe withall; or trueth for falſhood to maintaine it: ſeeing the chiefe eſſence of Vertue is to fly Vice, and of Trueth, to bee free from Falſhood. Plntarchs Morals, Ariſtotles Ethicks, Tullies Offices, and all practi
                     •
                  ke of Philoſophy auoucheth this to be true: but if from nature and reaſon▪ the hand-maides, wee aſcend to Religion the Miſtris, wee ſhall finde in Scripture this vndeniable maxime▪
                  Rom. 3. 8. 
                  Euill is not to bee done, that good may come of it: and therefore they which ſhall doe ſo, Saint Paul ſayth, Their damnation is iuſt: whence it followeth, that deuiliſh and miſchieuous practices, vndertaken for defence of Religion, and warranted by the grounds thereof, doe both argue a rotten Religion; (for like mother, like daughter, according to the Prouerbe:) and alſo prooue the profeſſours and practicers thereof to bee lyable to the iuſt damnation, alloted by the Spirit of God to ſuch wicked perſons: there is no cuaſion from this

concluſion, except they ſay that their practices are not euill; which whether they bee or no, the particulars of the ſecond propoſition, ſhall propound to the iudgement of him that will with an indifferent eye looke vnto them, and ſo I leaue this firſt propoſition, fortified with three ſtrong rampiers of Nature, Reaſon, and Religion; and come to the ſecond, wherein the pith and marrow of the argument conſiſteth.
               3. That the Church of Rome is guilty of ſuch vngodlyMinor. courſes, for the maintainance of it ſelfe, and their Religion, though miſerable experience doth ſufficiently prooue, yet becauſe whilſt things are conſidered in groſſe, they hide much of their worth and weight; therefore it ſhall not be a miſſe to diſplay them in particular, and to offer them by retaile to ſuch as haue a minde to apprehend the true value of their counterfeit wares. In theſe ſixe particulars therefore (to omit many other) I arraigne them as guilty before God and men: firſt of horrible treaſon: ſecondly, of cruell murther: thirdly, of damnable periury: fourthly, of groſſe lying: fift, of impudent and malicious ſlaundering: and laſtly, of apparent forgery; and theſe be the propps and pillars of their Religion, by theſe they labour to procure credit to themſelues, and diſgrace to vs: and with theſe weapons they fight againſt all that oppoſe themſelues againſt their damned opinions.
               4. Touching their treaſons, periuries, and cruelties, they are ſufficiently diſcouered in the firſt and ſecond reaſons before going, to which I referre the Reader for his full ſatisfaction: onely note, that as their practices haue beene notorious in theſe kindes, ſo they are deriued fundamentally from the grounds of their Religion: notorious I ſay, for who hath not heard of the ſoule treacheries and conſpiracies, practiſed by Popes, and their Agents againſt Kings, Emperours: ſome they haue depoſed, ſome priſoned, ſome murthered▪ ſome expelled their kingdomes, ſome betrayed into the hands of their enemies, ſome perſecuted and vndermined, and that by treacherous plots, and helliſh deuices; to omit all others, and to confine my ſpeach to our owne Countrey: the pretended Spaniſh inuaſion, in the yeere 1588, by that great Armado▪

Theſe I ſay, doe witneſſe ſufficiently, that treaſon is an ordinary practice amongſt that generation, for the maintenance of their Religion & pompe, and that they thinke it a lawfull and laudable act ſo to doe, it being the common doctrine of the Ieſuites and Canoniſts, that if a King be excommunicate, either ipſo facto, (as he is, if hee bee an Heretike by their doctrine) or by denunciation from the Pope, then his ſubiects are no further to obey him, but to rebell againſt him, yea depoſe and kill him, if by any meanes they can: and though they diſpence with their allegiance, during the neceſſity of time, yet it is with this limitation,

                  quoad, vntill they bee of ſufficient power, and haue fit opportunity to worke their purpoſe. This pernicious doctrine flowed from the mouthes and pens of Sunancha, Creſwell, alias Philopater mariana Lupus, Treſham, Bellarmine, Emanuell Sa; and almoſt all the reſt of that treacherous generation.

And laſtly, witneſſe that dreadfull maſſacre in France, vnder Charles the ninth, when in one night were murthered at Paris many thouſand Proteſtants, with the illuſtrious Admirall of France; and at Lions, and other places, within one month, as ſome ſay 40000. as others aboue 30000. The greateſt and moſt grieuous perfecution in the Primitiue Church, is not to bee compared to this; for it is recorded, that vnder Diocleſian, 17000. were martyred in one month; but behold heere the number doubled, that we might certainly know and beleeue that the Pope is that true and great Antichriſt, vnder whom,

and by whoſe meanes the greateſt perſecution that euer befell the Church of God ſhould happen.
               9. Neither is there doctrine any whit diſſonant from their practice: for thus Bellarmine deliuereth it in plaineBell. de Rom. Pontif. l. 5. c. 6. termes: as in a Chriſtian, the Spirit is to rule, ouer the fleſh, & to chaſtiſe it, and keepe it vnder, yea ſometimes to vndergoe death it ſelfe, as in the Martyrs: ſo the ſpirituall power reſiding in the Church (that is in the Pope) is to bridle and reſtraine the temporall, by all meanes what ſoeuer, if it rebell againſt it: yea the Cardinall Como, in his letters to Parry the Traitour, animateth him to the murther of the good Queene, by his damned poſition, that it is meritorious to kill a King excommunicate: and ſome of them goe yet deeper into hell, and entitle it an heroicall act, that is, no ordinary meritorious worke; but ſuchIeſuita Sicar. an extraordinary exploit, as none but men of a more then humane Spirit can performe; and for which an higher place in Heauen is reſerued, then for common merits. Can this Religion now bee of God, that is thus maintained by treachery, periury and blood-ſhed? Is not this Church rather the purple coloured harlot, ſpoken of in the Reuelation, embrued and dyed red with the blood of the Saints, then the true Catholike Church of Chriſt? Theſe things are ſo notorious, that I need not further enlarge them.
               10. Leauing therefore theſe, I come to the three laſt wicked4. meanes, whereby they maintaine their Religion: vpon which if I inſiſt ſomewhat longer, let the Reader beare with mee, for ſo the nature and nouelty of the matter requireth. Their next practice then to defend their Church and Religion is, by groſſe and palpable lying and falſhood; yea, ſo groſſe and palpable, that any ciuill honeſt man would bluſh to be reputed the author of ſuch fables, which they obtrude vpon ſilly people, as verities, neceſſary to bee beleeued, and which they like ſimple creatures giue faith vnto, aſmuch as vnto the Goſpell it ſelfe: and neither is the one or the other any maruaile, ſeeing Saint Paul propheſied long agoe, that on the one2. Theſſ. 2. 9. ſide Antichriſt his comming ſhould be according to the efficacy of Sathan, in all power, in lying ſignes and wonders: and on the

other, that God would ſend vpon them that receiued not the loue

And heere to omit their lying Reuelations, lying priuiledges, falſe Canons, forged donations, counterfeit de▪ lying martyrologies, all which are ſtuffed with notorious falſities, and that by the confeſſion of their owne Doctours: I will inſiſt onely vpon their lying miracles, wherein they vaunt themſelues as a marke of their Church, and wherewith they labour to vphold moſt of their erronious opinions.
               11. And firſt touching their miraculous tranſubſtantiatiō,1.
                  
and adoration of the Sacrament: not finding in Scripture ſufficient proofe for it: it is ſtrange to ſee how many monſtrous miracles they haue deuiſed for to win credit thereunto. Bozius,
                  Bozius de ſignis l. 14. c. 3. a man of great fame amongſt them, telleth vs theſe three tales: firſt, that Anthony of Padua, cauſed his horſe to kneele downe and worſhip the holy hoaſt, by which ſtrange ſight, a ſtout Heretike was conuerted to the true faith. And ſecondly, Saint Francis had a Cade Lambe, which vſed to goe to Maſſe, and would duely kneele downe at the eleuation, and adore. And thirdly, that a certaine deuout woman, to cure her Bees of the murren, and to make them fruitfull, put a conſecrated hoaſt into the Hiue, which when after a time ſhee tooke vp, ſhee not onely found a miraculous increaſe, but ſaw alſo a ſtrange wonder, the Bees had built a Chappell in the Hiue, with an Altar, and windowes, and doores, and a ſteeple with Bells, and had laid the hoaſt vpon the Altar, and with a heauenly noyſe flew about it, and ſung at their Canonicall houres, and kept watch by night, as Monkes vſe to doe in their Cloiſters. Who would not beleeue now but that the hoaſt is to be adored, if hee be not more ſenſleſſe then a horſe, or a Bee, or a Cade Lambe? But if this be true, why are Mice ſo prophane, that they dare rend it with their teeth? And why doth not the Popes Hackney kneele downe, and doe reuerence vnto it, when hee carrieth it on his backe, accompanied with muletters, and horſe-keepers, and Courtiſans, and Cookes, with ſumpter-horſes, and all the baggage of the Court, as oft as hisIohan. Monluc. Mih. de Rel. ad Reg. Mat. Fulmen Bruturn. pag. 12. & 13. Holineſſe is to trauell abroad; when hee himſelfe followeth, moūted vpon a goodly white palfrey, accōpanied with Cardinals, Primates, Biſhops, & Potentats? Is more honor to be giuen to Chriſts Vicar, then to Chriſt himſelfe? Or was Anthonies horſe more religious then all the Popes horſes? yea then the Pope himſelfe, and all his traine? And if the hoaſt bee ſo ſoueraigne a preſeruatiue for Bees, why doe any good houſewiues ſuffer their Bees to periſh, ſeeing they may haue the hoaſt for God amercy, or at leaſt wiſe for a very ſmall price? In the booke of the conformities of Saint Francis, wee findeLib. conformit. Sancti Franciſ. this miracle: On a time Fryer Francis ſaying Maſſe, found a

Spider in the Chalice, which hee would not for reuerence to the Sacrament caſt out, but drunke it vp with the blood: afterward rubbing his thigh, and ſcratching where it itched, the Spider came whole out of his thigh, without any harme to either: O ſtrange miracle; and yet not ſo ſtrange as this, that Chriſts bloud in the Chalice, ſhould poyſon Pope Victor; except Francis a Fryer were more holy then Victor a Pope: or the blood in one Chalice, were of greater force then in the other: but peraduenture the Prieſt in the one, had no intention to turne the wine into blood, as the Prieſt in the other had: and then wee know there can be no conuerſion: but no maruaile if this be true, ſeeing in the feſtiual of Corpus Chriſti day, we read as great a wonder as this: to wit, of a Prieſt, that hauing loſt the hoaſt in a wood, as hee came to houſell a woman that was ſicke, and hauing whipt himſelfe for his negligence, went backe to ſeeke his Lord God, and at laſt ſpying a pillar of fire, that reached from the earth to heauen, ran thereunto, and found Gods body at the foot of that pillar, and all the beaſts of the forreſt about it, kneeling on their foure knees, and adoring it with great deuotion, ex ept one blacke horſe, which kneeled but on one knee, and that blacke horſe (ſayth the ſtory) was a fiend of hell, who had turned himſelfe into that ſhape, that men might ſteale him, and bee hanged, as many had beene. This as it was reported to bee done not far from Exbridge in Deuon-ſhire: ſo it was as ſolemnely read in the Church, and as verily beleeued, as any miracle that euer Chriſt wrought: who can doubt now, but that the bread in the Sacrament, is really changed into the body of Chriſt, and the wine into his blood, if this be true.
               12. Againe, to proue their doctrine of concomitance, that2. is, that whole Chriſt is vnder both formes of the Sacrament:Bell. de Sacramento Euchar. l. 4. c. 14. 
                  Bellarmine produceth examples out of Surius: Ʋincentius, and Alexander Aleuſis, where miraculouſly out of the bread being broken, blood plentifully flowed to the view of the beholders: which if they were true, as may very wel be doubted, yet euince not that doctrine: for thoſe miracles might be wroght rather for the cōuictiō of profane & irreligious receiuers,

& confirmation of Chriſtian Religion, againſt all enemies therof, whether Infidels or Heretikes, then for the proof of the reall preſence, or cōcomitance of both parts of the Sacrament, vnder one ſigne: but that they were not true, wee haue iuſt cauſe to ſuſpect, ſeeing the eldeſt of thoſe miracles are litle aboue a hundred yere old, at what time true miracles were vtterly ceaſed in the Church, & falſeones were foiſted into their roomes, as witneſſeth Lyranus, who ſayth, that the people in his
                  Lyran. in Dan. 14. 
                  time were notably deceiued by falſe miracles, forged by Prieſts, and their complices for gaine: and Canus, who affirmeth, that writers in his time forged many things of purpoſe, and ſuggeſted
                  Canus loc. l. 11. c. 6. 
                  falſe miracles, to pamper the peoples humor, and to gaine credit to Religion: and in that reſpect taxeth diuerſe graue authors, for their proneneſſe in ſatisfying the peoples appetite: and Agrippa, who ſayth, that the writers of hiſtories making godly lies,

               13. Further for the proofe of their Canonization, and inuocation3. of Saints, it is a wonder to ſee how many wonders they haue deuiſed. For to omit that which Cardinall Baronius
                  Baron. anno 1028. reports as a truth, out of Guillerinus, and Vincentius, touching Saint Fulbert, that becauſe he was a moſt deuout worſhipper of the Virgin Mary, therefore ſhee came vnto him in his ſickneſſe, and gaue him her breſts to ſucke: as alſo how ſhee came to Saint Bernard in his ſickneſſe, to viſit him, accompanied

                     bert robbed other Saints of their relicks, to enrich the Temples of Saint Denis, Saint Ruſtick, and Saint Eleutherie, whereupon it came to paſſe that there aroſe great debate betweene the Saints, for thoſe Saints which he had ſpoiled, as Saint Hilary, Saint Fremin, and others, ioyned themſelues with the Deuils, and craued ayd of them to carry away the ſoule of the good king to hell: but he called to his help the other Saints which he had enriched, who reſiſted ſo valiantly the Deuils and the Saints wronged, that they tooke away from them his ſoule and carried it to Paradiſe. Who? which hath any ſpark of grace would not enrich the Temples, and relicks of theſe three Saints, ſeeing their power is ſo great to deliuer a man from the Deuill? But this next of Saint Fremin is full as ſtrange; for the golden Legend reporteth, that

after the Sunne had miraculouſly ſent his beames through a ſtone wall vpon Saint Fremins graue, and thereupon they had
                     Legend. Inuent. of the body of Saint Fremin mortus.
                   digged to finde out his body, there iſſued thence ſuch a ſweet ſmell, as they weened they had been in a Paradiſe: which odour ſpread it ſelfe not onely through the city of Aniens where the body lay, but alſo vnto diuers other cities, the ſweetnes whereof as it mooued much people to bring their oblations to this glorious Saint, ſo it cured ſome a far off (as the Lord of Ba
                        •
                     gency) from their diſeaſes: but when this body was taken vp and carried in the city of Aniens, ſtrange wonders were wrought: for then the Elements mooued, (ſayth the ſtory) the Snow that was at that time great on the earth was turned into pouder and duſt: and the Ice that hung on the trees became flowers and leaues, and the meadowes became greene: and the Sunne which by his courſe ſhould goe low that day, aſcended as high as it vſeth to be on Saint Iohn Baptiſts day in Summer: and as men bare the body of this Saint, the trees enclined and worſhipped it, and all manner of ſicke perſons what malady ſoeuer they had, receiued health, at the Inuention of the bleſſed body of Saint Fremin.
               
               17. Another as ſtrange a tale wee haue touching the relicksLegend Sancti Stephani. of Saint Stephen, and Saint Lawrence: for when as one of them was buried at Rome, the other at Conſtantinople (ſayth the Legend) the Emperours daughter which was poſſeſſed with an euill Spirit, was brought to touch the relicks of Saint Stephen, but the Diuell within her cryed, that he could not be diſpoſſeſſed, except the body of Saint Stephen was tranſlated to Rome: whereupon meanes was made that Saint Stephens body ſhould be carried to Rome, and in liew thereof, Saint Lawrence his body ſhould bee brought to Conſtantinople. Now in the way as they were making this conueyance, the city of Capua gat the right arme of Stephen, and builded their Metropolitane Church in honour thereof: but when they were come to Rome, they would haue borne the body of Saint Stephen to the Church of Saint Peter ad Vincula, but they that bare it were not able to goe any further: and then the Deuill in the mayd cryed out, Ye trauaile for nought, for he

ſhall not be heere, but with Lawrence his brother, therefore they bare the body thither, and then the mayd touching the body was preſently made whole, and Saint Lawrence as reioycing at the comming of his brother, and ſmiling, turned himſelfe into the other ſide of the Sepulchre, and made roome for him to lye in: and when the Greekes would haue taken vp the body of Saint Lawrence to carry it to Conſtantinople, they were ſtroken dead, till the Pope and his Clearks by their prayers reuiued them againe: who would not now worſhip the relicks of Saints, if ſuch great myracles be wrought by them.
               18. But to conclude this poynt, and not to trouble the reader with too much of this pedling ſtuffe: thus they labour to gaine worſhip to Images, honour to the Croſſe, and Crucifix, and credit to Purgatory, and prayer for the dead, and countenance to popiſh ſingle life, as of many hundred examples which might be produced, let theſe few ſuffice. Saint George being put into a frying pan full of boyling lead, made but the ſigne of the croſſe, and he was therein refreſhed as if he had bin in a bath. Saint Margaret was ſwallowed vp of the Diuell in the figure of a Dragon, but making the ſigne of the croſſe in the Dragons belly, the Dragon burſt, and out came Saint Margaret ſafe and ſound. It is ſayd alſo that ſhe took the Diuel by the haire of the head, and beate him about the eares. Saint Goodreck with the ſigne of the croſſe tamed Wolues and Serpents in ſuch ſort, that they lay with him by the fire ſide without offering any hurt. Saint Chriſtopher being a Giant of twelue cubits in height, determined with himſelfe to ſerue none but the greateſt King in the world: and therefore being in ſeruice to a great King, he ſpied him croſſing himſelfe againſt the Diuell: wherefore perceiuing that he was afraid of the Diuell, he went to ſerue him as one greater then the former, and perceiuing that the Diuell auoyded the ſight of a croſſe, he asked him, why he did ſo? to whom the Diuell anſwered, that there was a man called Chriſt which was hanged on the Croſſe, in feare of whom, as oft as he ſaw the ſigne of the Croſſe he fled from it, for which cauſe

Saint Chriſtopher perceiuing that Chriſt was a greater King, renounced the Deuill, and betooke himſelfe to the ſeruice of Chriſt, and was called Chriſtopher, whereas before his name was Reprobus. He that would read a merry tale indeed, let him read the Legend of Saint Chriſtopher: As for a fearefull tale, let him goe to Saint Brandons Legend: all the old wiues tales that euer were told in a chimney corner, are not to be compared to theſe two.
               19. It is no newes amongſt them for Images to ſpeake, nod the head, ſhake the hand, ſweat, and ſuch like: or at leaſt for ſome crafty Prieſt to worke theſe feates, to delude the people. The Image of the bleſſed Virgin Mary is ſayd to haue ſpoken diuers times, to Saint Bernard, when ſhe bad him good morrow, whereupon the good man ſhould anſwere, that ſhe broke the Canons of the Church, becauſe it was forbidden that a woman ſhould ſpeake in the Church. To Saint Hyacinth,
                  Scuerin. de vita & mirac. Sancti Hyacinth. lib. 1. cap. 13. who flying from the Tartarians, the Image thus cryed vpon him with a loud voyce, O my ſonne Hiacinthus doeſt thou eſcape the hands of the Tartarians, and leaueſt me and my ſonne to be cut in pieces, and trampled vnder feet: To whom Hiacinthus anſwering, O glorious Virgin, this thy Image is too heauy, how ſhall I he able to carry it? The Virgin replyed, Take it, for my ſonne will lighten the burden. And to Alexius, who ſtayingLegen. Lombard. long in the Church-porch, the Image of our Lady ſpoke and bade the Sexten let him in.

would goe to Rome, anſwered, that ſhe would: the other of Fortune, who vttered theſe words, Yee haue rightly ſeene mee O nation, and rightly dedicated mee.
               
               20. But that Images vſed to beck, and mooue their heads, and ſtir their hands, there are ſo many examples that it would be loſt labour to ſtand vpon them, onely the image of SaintThis is knowen to be true by many of the inhabitants yet liuing. 
                  Nicholas at Weſtchester, may diſcouer the trick of all the reſt, for at the burning of it in the Market-place of the city, there was diſcouered this trick of faſt and looſe, the Image was made with ſuch a deuice, that if one ſtanding behinde, did pull a certaine ſtring which was in the back part thereof, it would mooue the hand, as if it bleſſed the people. The like may we thinke of that Roode of Poyters, which when William Longſhampe
                  Houeden. Biſhop of Ely lay a dying, did piteouſly weepe and lament, ſo that the teares fell downe from his eyes, as it had been a floud of water, but no meruaile, for as they ſay, it was the accuſtomed vſe of that Roode alwayes to mourne when a Biſhop departed. A pretty ſtory there is in one of the Legends of the Virgin Mary, of a woman who prayed deuoutly to that Image for the deliuering of her ſonne out of priſon, and when ſhee ſaw that her prayers preuailed nothing, ſhee tooke away from the Virgin her ſonne out of her armes, and carryed it home, whereupon our Lady preſently went to the priſon and deliuered the womans ſonne out of hold: then the woman (ſayth the tale) brought backe the Virgin Maries ſonne, and gaue it her againe, ſaying, O bleſſed Virgine now thou haſt restored my ſonne vnto mee, behold againe thy ſonne vnto thee, and ſo both parties were well pleaſed.

Eraſm. in epiſt. ſpirits, of the firſt kind was that reported by diuers authors of certaine Prieſts, that dwelling not far from the ſea ſide, tooke a number of ſea-crabs, and tyed vnto each of them light, and ſo put them vpon dead mens graues in the Churchyards,

to make the poore country people beleeue that Spirits did walke: but in one place, the legerdemaine was deprehended, for the Carpenters and Maſons comming the next day after all Soules night to worke, found among the timber and broken bricks ſome of the Crabs, with their candles on their backs extinguiſhed, whereby the knauery of this miracle was diſcouered. Of the ſecond kind it may be was that recorded by Saint Gregory in his Dialogues, (if that booke be his as is iuſtly doubted, for he telleth there a tale of a Beare which was commaunded to keepe the Hermite Florences ſheepe, a thing not ſauouring of Saint Gregories ſpirit, or if it did, then it argueth him to haue been too credulous of lying reports, (as he isCanus loc lib. 11. cap. 6. taxed by their own Canus) of a ſoule appearing vnto a Prieſt that bathed himſelfe often in a water, & officiouſly pulling off his ſhoes, with an earneſt deſire to enioy his prayers and oblations for his deliuerance, which being performed, when he returned to the bath and found the ſoule no more there, hee concluded, that his prayers had deliuered him out of Purgatory.
               22. In one of theſe two ranks are all the ſtrange ſtories publiſhed by theſe Dialogues, Beda, Brigitta, Dioniſius, Carthuſianus, touching walking ghoſts, for eyther they were iugling tricks of impoſters to deceiue the ſimple, or deceits of deuils to delude the learned: and this may in no poynt more playnely be proued, then againſt Prieſts mariages, for the diſgracing whereof, and aduancing ſingle life aboue it, an Idoll at Winchester muſt ſpeake as before hath been ſhewed.

                  Eſpenſaeus in 2. tim. 4. 
                  are full of fables; yea that very fictions are contained in their porteſſes: and Canus another learned writer, that the Pagan Hiſtriographers
                  Canus loc. lib. 11 c. 6. 
                  did more truely write the liues of Emperours, then the Chriſtians did the liues of Saints: and that in the golden Legend, there are monſters for miracles, rather then true miracles: and that hee which wrote this booke, was a man of a braſen face, and a leaden heart.
               
               23. Thus it is euident by the confeſſion of many learned of their owne ſide, that theſe bee lying tales, coyned as holy
                  Piae fraudes. Agrip. de vanit. c. 97. 
                  deceits, as ſome of them terme them, but more truely, as deuiliſh deuices, not to maintaine the truth, but errour: for how can that bee the truth which ſtandeth in need of lying to maintaine it: Caietane a Cardinall, and a great learned diuineCaiet. opuſc. de concept. Virg. c. 1. Antonin. part. 1. c. 8. tit. 2. ſayth, that the credit of the Romiſh miracles dependeth vpon the report of men, who may deceiue others, and bee deceiued themſelues: and Antoninus the Archbiſhop of Florence, calleth the viſions of Bernard and Briget, touching the conception of the Virgin Mary, fantaſtick viſions, and mens dreams: why ſhould wee then beleeue them to bee true, when as they themſelues beleeue them not.
               24. If they obiect and ſay, why may not theſe miracles be as true as thoſe which are reported by many of the ancient Fathers: and ſeeing famous miracles haue beene in all ages of the Church, why ſhould theſe laſt ages bee ſuſpected for falſity,Bel. de notis eccleſ. lib. 4. c. 14. more then the former? I anſwere firſt, that thoſe Fathers themſelues, which were reporters of ſuch miracles, yet did repoſe no ſuch confidence in them, as to build their faith vpon them, as the Romaniſts doe: for Saint Auguſtine ſayth, Quiſquis adhuc, &c. Whoſoeuer yet ſeeketh aften wonders, that hee
                  
                  may beleeue, is himſelfe a great wonder, who when the world beleeueth,
                  Aug. de ciuit. lib. 22. c. 8. Idem tract. 13. in Iohan. 
                  doth not beleeue: and in another place: Contra iſtos mirabilirios, &c. Againſt theſe miracle-mongers, my God hath made mee wary, ſaying, there ſhall ariſe in the laſt dayes falſe Prophets, working ſignes and wonders, that they might lead into errour, if it

And Chryſoſtome, or whoſoeuer els was the author of thoſe learned homilies on Mathew, proueth that the true Church of Chriſt cannot bee diſcerned or knowen by ſignes or other meane, but onely by the Scripture: and that the working of miracles is more found among falſe Chriſtians,

                  then true: & Tertullian ſayth plainly, that the Heretikes did raiſe the dead, cure maladies, & foretell things to come: the ſame is affirmed by Chryſoſtome, Ierome, Euthe
                        •
                     ius & Theophilact; as witneſſeth Maldonate the Ieſuite: by which it appeareth, that the Fathers thought miracles were not to bee regarded, except they were wrought for the confirmation of the truth: and that a miracle was to bee examined by the doctrine, not the doctrine by a miracle: and therefore, that they are not any proper and true markes of the Church, as the Romaniſts make them: nay that they are rather markes of Antichriſt, and his Church, as both our Sauiour and Saint Paul plainely auouch;Mat. 24. 24. 2. Theſſ. 2. 9. 10 ſo that by this their great bragge of miracles, they giue vs this ſtrong aduantage againſt them, that their Pope is Antichriſt, and their Church Antichriſtian, which otherwiſe wee ſhould want.
               25. And ſecondly I anſwere, that they themſelues reiect diuerſe miracles of the fathers, as fantaſtick viſions, and mensAntonin. part. 1. tit. 8. c. 2. dreames: ſo doth Antoninus call the viſion of Bernard and Briget, in the queſtion of the Virgin Maries conception: and Canus taxeth Gregory and Bede with this: that they miſſed the
                  Canus loc. lib. 11. c. 6. pag. 658. louan. 1569. 
                  marke now and then, who wrote miracles, talked of and beleeued among the vulgar: that is, which they receiued by heareſay, and not by any eye-witneſſe, or ſound proofe: now why ſhould wee be reſtrained from that liberty towards the reſt, which they take towards Gregory and Bede: eſpecially ſeeing many of their miracles are ſuch, as no reaſonable man would euer beleeue, and deſerue rather the ſplene then the braine:

as for example Saint Ierome reporteth this to bee one of Saint Anthonies miracles; how Anthonie trauailing in the wilderneſſe,Hierom. in vita Paul

                   to ſeeke out Paul, the Hermite met with a Centaure, (halfe a man, and halfe a horſe) who ſpoke to him, and ſhewed him the way; and by and by when the Centaure was gone, meeteth him another Monſter like a Satyre, with a hook noſe, and hornes on his head, the lower part of his body like a goat, offering him a branch of palme: whom Anthony asking who he was, he anſwered; I am a mort all creature, an inhabitant of the wildernes, ſuch an one as the Gentiles deluded with error, called a Satyre; and I am come as an Embaſſadour from my flocke, to beſeech yon to pray to God for vs, whom wee know to bee come for the ſaluation of the world, whoſe ſound is gone through the earth: if this bee true, that there are ſuch monſters; or if they bee, that they beleeue in Chriſt, and ſo may bee ſaued: let vs beleue then all that euer the Poets haue written of Ixion, Polyphemus, Pan, Silenus, & other ſuch like mōſters: Gregory Niſſen
                  Gregor. Nyſſen. orat. de vita Thaumaturgi. writeth, touching Thammaturgus, that the Virgin Mary, and Saint Iohn camedown from heauē to him, & taught him his creed: which is as likely to bee true, as that which the Poets write of Apollo, that taght Aeſcul

               26. Saint Bernard, in the life of Malachias (if at leaſt thatBernard. de vita Malachiae. booke bee Saint Bernards) telleth vs of Malchus the teacher of Malachias, how hee reſtored hearing to one that was deafe, and how the patient confeſſed, that when the holy man put his fingers into both his eares, hee felt as it were two pigges iſſuing out of them. Againe hee reporteth, that a certaine Prior of the Regular Friers, ſeing Malachie the Biſhop to haue many ſeruants, but few horſes, gaue vnto him the horſe that hee rode on which beeing a reſtie iade, and ſetting hard, at the firſt the Biſhop found him ſo, but ere hee had ridden farre, by a wonderfull change, hee prooued a very excellent and precious palfrey, ambling moſt ſweetly: the like tale wee reade in the Dialogues aſcribed to Gregory, of a horſe, which a Noble-man lent to Pope Iohn, whichGregor. dialog. lib. 3. c. 2. beeing a very gentle, ſober nagge, when as afterward

the noble mans wife ſhould bee ſet vpon him, hee puſt and pranced, and ſtampt moſt ſtrongly, diſdaining that a woman ſhould ſit vpon his backe, which had carried the high Prieſt of the world: much like to King Alexanders Bucephalus, which being bare, would carry any groome quietly; but when his trappings and furniture was on, then hee would endure none but Alexander. The writer of the life of Saint Bernard, relateth a pretty wonder, done by that holy man at the dedication of a Church, when as the place was ſo filled with multitude of flies, that the people could not enter into it without great annoyance: Saint Bernard vſing no other meanes to deſtroy them, ſaid onely, I excommunicate them; and preſently the next morning they were all found dead on the floore. Doth this ſauour of Saint Bernards holineſſe: or can any man bee ſo madde as to thinke, that ſo holy a man would denounce excommunication, ordained to ſeparate from the Congregation open and ſinfull men, againſt poore ſilly flies: ſure hee hath no more wit then a flye, that will beleeue this: ſo that notwithſtanding the ancient miracles recorded by the Fathers, yet the Legendary Romiſh miracles are not freed from groſſe and notorious falſhood.
               27. Another practice of theirs to win credit to their Religion,5. and diſgrace to ours, is ſlaundering and calumniating both our Religion, and the profeſſours thereof: and that ſo groſſely and falſely, that their owne conſciences could not chuſe but ſay ſecretly vnto their tongues, thou lyeſt, when they were writing them in their bookes: but they deale like theeues, who to cleare themſelues from ſuſpition of robbery, raiſe vp hue, and cry againſt true men: or like harlots, that lay the imputation of diſhoneſtie vpon ſober matrones, to the end that they themſelues might bee thought chaſt and honeſt: ſo beeing full of ſores and blemiſhes themſelues, they ſeeke to couer their owne ſhame, by diſcouering ours. Which if it were in truth, though their enuy was neuer the leſſe, yet their ſinne was not ſo great: but beeing notorious and outragious lyes, they plainely ſhow that they care not what they belch foorth, ſo they ſtaine vs with the filth thereof: and that

they haue learned that Ma
                     •
                  chauillian rule, audacter calumniari, to ſlander boldly; becauſe though the wound bee healed, yet a ſcarre remaineth.
               28. Their ſlanders are darted either againſt our perſons, orI. the gouernment of our Church, or our doctrines: let vs take a ſhort view of all theſe: and firſt for their perſonall ſlanders; they ſlander all of vs in generall, with the ignominious titles of ſolifidians, nullifidians, nudifidians, Infidels, worſe then Turkes, &c. yea and ſay that wee haue no faith, no Religion, no Chriſt, no God; and what not that either malice can deuiſe, or enuy and rage vtter? Theſe ſlanderous reproches areParſons 3. convin. Kelliſon ſuruey. l. 4. Wright. art. 2. l 3. Reynold.

               29. But let vs heare their reaſons why we are all Infidels: mary they propound two principall ones, and thoſe very ſtrong, as they thinke: firſt they ſay that all learned Proteſtants are Infidels, becauſe they build their faith vpon their owne priuate expoſition of Scripture: and ſecondly, that ignorant Proteſtants are Infidels, becauſe they rely their faith vpon their Miniſters credit. To the firſt, I anſwere two things, firſt, that wee doe not interpret the Scripture by our own priuate iudgements, but by the Scripture it ſelfe: for ſome places are ſo plaine, & thoſe principally that contain the grounds of Religion, that they need no expoſition, as Saint Auguſtine
                  Aug in Iohan. tract. 50. witneſſeth, ſaying that quaedam in Scripturis, &c. There be ſome things in the Scripture ſo manifeſt, that they require rather a hearer then an expounder: and what thoſe things are, the ſame father declareth in another place, where he ſayth, that in thoſe
                  
                  things which are plainely ſet downe in Scripture, are found all

                  thoſe points which containe faith and manners: and thoſe things which are obſcure and hard in Scripture, we do not expound by any forraine or priuate interpretation, but by conferring them with other more plaine and perſpicuous places: and ſo except they ſay that the Scripture it ſelfe is of a priuate interpretation, they cannot condemne vs of that crime. Now that this is the beſt way of interpreting, let the ſame Auguſtine informe vs, who ſayth, That there is nothing contained in hard
                  Idem Ibid. l. 2. c. 6. 
                  places of Scripture, which is not to be found moſt plainely vttered in others: and Chryſoſtome, who affirmeth, that the Scripture
                  Chryſoſt. hom. 12 in Gen. Baſil. quaeſt. compt. explic. q. 267. Hier. com. in Iſay. c. 19. 
                  expoundeth it ſelfe, and ſuffereth not the Reader to erre: and Baſill, who telleth vs, that thoſe things which be doubtfull, or ſeeme to be couertly ſpoken, in ſome places of holy Scripture, are expounded by other plaine places. Of the ſame minde are the reſt of the Fathers: and ſo wee expound the Scripture no otherwiſe then all the ancient Fathers vſed to doe, and then indeed it ought to be.
               30. I, but wee follow not the iudgement of the Church, (ſay they) which hath the onely key of interpretation committed vnto it: if they meane by the Church the fathers, we may iuſtify our ſelues by condemning them of the ſame fault: they deale with them as the Iewes dealt with their wiues, if they pleaſe their humors they hold vnto them; but if they croſſe or thwart them, they ſue out a bill of diuorce againſt them, and put them away: nothing is more common then this in all their writings: and therefore it needs no inſtances to prooue it: if they meane the Councils; why, by their owne teaching, no Councill is of ſufficient authority, except it bee confirmed by the Pope: nor any decree or interpretation to bee entertained without his approbation. Therefore they muſt needs meane the Pope alone, and if they doe ſo, then we confeſſe that wee haue iuſt cauſes not to tye our faith to his girdle, nor our vnderſtanding to his braine: ſeeing many of that ranke haue beene open Heretikes, ſome notorious Atheiſts, all men and therefore ſubiect to errour: yea ſeeing the body of their Church is an Apoſtate harlot, and the ſurmiſed

head on earth, that man of ſinne, the great Antichriſt, ſpoken of in the Scriptures. If to vary from him then, and his Babylon, in our expoſition of Scripture, bee priuate interpretation, wee confeſſe our ſelues guilty, but in all other reſpects cleare and innocent.
               31. Secondly, grant that wee doe in ſome points follow on our owne priuate expoſition, yet wee are not therefore Infidels: for then moſt of the Fathers ſhould bee infidels aſwell as wee: for there are few of them which haue not ſometimes priuately, vea and falſely expounded the Scriptures: as their owne Doctors confeſſe. Canus ſaying that they ſpake
                  Canus loc. l. 7. c. 3. Poſſeu. biblioth. ſelect. l. 12. c. 23. 
                  with a humane ſpirit, and erred ſometimes in things which afterward haue appeared to appertaine to the faith: and Poſſeuine, that there are ſome things in the Fathers, wherein vnwitingly they diſſented from the Church; either therefore they muſt tax them with infidelity aſwell as vs, or cleare vs aſwell as them, if al the force of the argument hang vpon this pin, that therefore wee are Infidels, becauſe we priuatly expound the Scriptures.
               32. To the ſecond, viz. that all vnlearned Proteſtants are Infidels, becauſe they rely their faith vpon the credit of the tranſlatours, I anſwere three things; firſt, that they doe not rely their faith vpon the credit and fidelity of any tranſlatour, but partly vpon the iudgement and authority of the Church, which receiueth ſuch tranſlations, and alloweth them, and is able to iudge of them: and partly and principally vpon the word tranſlated, which containeth ſuch holy and heauenly doctrine, as none that readeth, or heareth it, can chuſe but acknowledge the Maieſtie of Gods Spirit ſpeaking in it.
               33. Secondly, if our people are therefore Infidels, becauſe they cannot examine the tranſlations by the Hebrew and Greeke, and doe therefore rely their faith vpon the tranſlatours credit: then Auguſtine was an infidell, who knew neither of theſe languages, but was as it is written of him, monogloſſos: and then many godly Doctours and Fathers of the Church were Infidels, who for the moſt part were all ignorant of the Hebrew tongue, and ſome of them of the Greeke

alſo: and laſtly then all the godly Chriſtians in the purer timesTheodor, de curation, Graecor. affection. lib. 5. who both read and heard the Scriptures tranſlated into their mother tongues were infidels, for they all relyed their faith vpon the word tranſlated, but not for the tranſlators ſake, who might erre in tranſlating many places, but for the ſound, holy, and heauenly doctrine therein contayned.
               34. Thirdly, if this maketh men infidels to relye their faith vpon man; then the ignorant Romaniſts muſt needs be all infidels, whoſe implicite, Colliarlike faith is grounded onely vpon the Church: that is not onely vpon the Pope, who is in power the whole Church, but alſo vpon euery ordinary Paſtor, be he Ieſuite, or Prieſt, or Frier, or any other, whom they are (according to their diuinity) bound in conſcience to beleeue whatſoeuer they teach, as hath been ſhewed: now this is to rely their faith vpon the fidelity and credit of man, and therfore the blame of infidelity falleth vpon them more iuſtly then vpon vs: and thus this accuſation of theirs, that we haue no faith, no religion, no God, no Chriſt, but are plain Infidels, is a moſt notorious and open ſlander.
               35. Thus generally they ſlander our religion, and the profeſſors2. thereof, but not content therewith, they ſet vpon particular perſons, and thoſe that are moſt eminent in our Church, either in authority of place, or excellency of learning, that like Captaines march in the head of the ranks. For to omit their horrible raylings againſt Kings, Princes, Magiſtrates, Nobles, and men of high place, that any wayes oppoſed themſelues to the Romiſh Monarchie, whoſe glorious vertues were ſo reſplendent, that the miſt of their ſlanders cannot darken the luſtre thereof: Lord how they raue and rage againſt the aſhes of Luther, Oecolampadius, Zwinglius, Caluin, Beza, and other worthie champions of our Church.

               38. Sleidan writeth of Luther, that his death was moſtSleidan commen. lib 16. Lonicer. theat. hiſtor. pag. 244. ſweet and comfortable, full of heauenly prayers, and godly exhortations, at which were preſent the Earle of Mansfield, and other Noblemen, Iuſtus Ionas the Schoolemaiſter of his children, Michael Caeleus, Iohannes Aurifaber, and many more, who teſtified the ſame to be true: and Eraſmus reportethEraſ. epiſt. li. 11. ep. 1. ad Card. Eborac. of his life, that it was approoued with great conſent of all men, and that the integritie of his manners was ſuch, that his very enemies could finde nothing in him that they might calumniate: which to be true, may appeare by this, that Fiſher the Biſhop of Rocheſter his profeſt aduerſary writing againſt him, doth not in all his booke once tax him of miſdemeanour, or of any notorious crime, which he would ſurely haue done, if any either iuſt cauſe, or light ſuſpition had beene miniſtred vnto him.
               39. Touching the life and death of Caluine, Beza whoReynold, Caluino turenſ. l. 2. c. 11. was his familiar friend, and dayly aſſociate, affirmeth, that the one was full of holineſſe and good works, and voyd of ſcandall: and the other full of peace to himſelfe, and comfort to his friends and beholders. Nicholaus Gelaſius writeth ofNichol. Gelaſ. in epiſt. praefix. com. Caluino in Eſayam. his death, that he was at that time ſo farre from blaſpheming and curſing, that the day before his death he called all the Miniſters of the city together, and tooke his leaue of them with moſt holy and louing ſpeaches, and the next day gaue ouer his life, dormienti ſimilior quam morienti, more like to one that ſlept then that dyed.
               40. Zwinglius was ſlaine indeed in the warre againſt Romaniſts, but that doth not proue either his life to haue beene

vicious, or his doctrine erroneous, for then good Ioſias ſhould be condemned for an vngodly king, who was ſlaine in warre2. Chron. 35▪
                   by the Egyptians: and they muſt needs bring their owne Doctor Sanders into the ſame imputation, and that by greater reaſon, who was ſlaine in the Iriſh war, not onely againſt Proteſtants, but like a perfidious traitour againſt his owne countrey and Soueraigne. Oecolampadius whom they accuſe to haue died ſuddenly in the night, albeit that kind of death hath and might befall Gods deare children, as it did that good Emperour Theodoſius, of whoſe ſaluation, Saint Ambroſe neuertheleſſe maketh no doubt: yet Simon Gryneus who was preſent at his death, and Wolfangus Capito that liued at that time, report, that he lay ſick ſixteene dayes, and before his death exhorted all that were preſent to prayer and conſtancie, and after he had ſung the fiftieth Pſalme throughout, he gaue vp the ghoſt, with much aſſurance of Gods fauour. As for Caroloſtadius, though we haue no witneſſes of his life and death extant in print (as far as I haue read) yet it is moſt likely that this report of his death commeth out of the ſame mint, ſeeing it iſſued out of the mouth of his ſworne enemies, and thoſe that hated him. Beza himſelfe confeſſeth the errours of his youth, but they were whilſt he was a Romiſh affected and vnconuerted, and yet no ſuch great matters neither, as might vtterly blemiſh his good name, for they were not laſciuious acts, but wanton poems, the froth of youth: but let them touch him if they can after he became a Proteſtant, malice it ſelfe is not able to caſt any durt of ſcandall vpon him.
               41. Now compare our witneſſes with theirs, theirs were enemies, ours friends: theirs led with malice, ours with loue: theirs abſent, ours preſent: theirs report that which they had by heareſay (if they did not rather deuiſe then receiue) ours tell nothing but that whereof they were eye-witneſſes: now iudge whether malice be not more prone to ſlander, then friendſhip to flatter; and whether an enemy is not euer more forward to defame, then a friend to maintaine credit; and whether is more likely to lye, a malitious foe in diſgracing,

or a louing friend in commending: and laſtly whether deſerueth better credit thoſe that are abſent, and fetch their report from other mens mouthes, or thoſe that are preſent, and ſpeake vpon their owne knowledge, and beholding. Surely the doubt may eaſily bee reſolued, if we conſider either thatPlautus. which the Poet ſayth, &c. One eye witneſſe is more worth then tenne eare witneſſes, or that which their own Bellarmine ſayth,Bell. de notis e

                     cl. l. 4 c. 14. 
                  Stultum eſt, &c. It is a fooliſh thing to beleeue thoſe that are abſent, rather then thoſe that were preſent: or that which reaſon it ſelfe, grounded vpon Religion, telleth vs, that malice is more prone to lye and diſcredit an enemie, then loue and friendſhip is to defend a friend, ſeeing an euill affection in a wicked man is perfectly euill, but a good affection in any man is imperfectly good. Theſe teſtimonies being thus weighed in an euen ballance, wee haue greater reaſon to beleeue Sleydan, Eraſmus, Gelaſius, Melanchton, Capito, Gryneus: then Cochlaeus, Surius. Bolſecas, or Schuſſelburgus, though not a Romaniſt, yet as great an enemy: or any of theſe rayling Rabſakehs, who cared not what they wroght againſt our perſons, ſo that they might ſpringle diſgrace vpon our Religion thereby.
               42. But wee, if wee would vrge this argument againſt them, and indeed as oft as wee doe it, wee produce not for witneſſes their enemies, but their cloſe friends, and profeſt fauourers of their Religion; as Polonus, Platina, Onuphrius, Lui

                     •
                   vs: but the conſtant reports of thoſe that were ſworne ſubjects to the Sea of Rome and therefore would haue rather with Shem, caſt their cloakes vpon the naked filthineſſe of their holy Fathers, then with Cham laughed at the ſame, had

it not beene ſo notorious and famous, that it could not bee hidden.
               43. To conclude, that not onely by probable coniecture, but by euident proofe their ſlanders may appeare: wee haue two notable arguments of the ſame; the firſt is that ſtrange tale ſpread abroad in Italy, touching Luthers death, before heLonicer. theat. hiſtor. pag. 246. was dead: how in his ſickneſſe hee deſired the body of our Lord to bee communicated vnto him; and after when he ſaw his end approach, entreated that his body might bee laide on the Altar, and worſhipped with diuine honours: and how at his buriall Almighty God raiſed a great noyſe and tumult, and that the holy hoſte hung in the aire, and in a thunder that his body was taken out of his graue, and nothing left but a ſtinke of brimſtone, which had well nigh ſtifled all the ſtanders by. This tale was publiſhed before Luthers death, and a copie thereof came into his owne hands, which he read with a glad heart, and deteſted the blaſphemy therein contained. The likeBeza epiſt. ante Annot. iu nouum teſtam. ſlander was raiſed vp touching Beza his death, long before hee dyed, and came alſo into his hands, as may appeare in his Epiſtle before his annotations vpon the new Teſtament; by which wee may ſee what manner of reports they bee, which are deuiſed by theſe Romaniſts againſt vs; and ex vngue leonem, by this iudge of the reſt. The ſecond is the confeſſion of that perfidious Apoſtate Bolſek, who (as it is reported) in a publike Synode with weeping eyes, acknowledged with what vniuſt and ſlanderous reproches he had loaden Caluine, and that all which hee had written of him to his diſgrace, was falſe and vntrue: now what Bolſeck did againſt Caluine, wee haue iuſt cauſe to thinke to hane beene the practice of the others, againſt the reſt of the fore-named godly men, and all other of our profeſſion, knowing that old Prouerbe to bee true, that though the wound of a mans good name be healed, yet a ſcarre will euer remaine. Let this ſuffice, touching their perſonall ſlaunders, though much more might bee added: for their malice in this kinde, is of an vnlimitable extent.
               44. Secondly, they calumniate our gouernment, and that3. Sander. lib, de Schiſmat. which two notable falſe accuſations: firſt, of vniuſtice, both

in the ſubſtance of the Lawes, enacted againſt them, and ſecondly, of cruelty in the execution of the ſame▪ Lawes: but it is an eaſie matter to diſcouer their ſlanders, and to iuſtifie our ſtate from both theſe imputations: for touching our Lawes; firſt of all they are of that nature, that except they will condemne all the ſtatute Lawes that euer were made, either in this, or any other common wealth, they cannot condemne them of iniuſtice: they were not made in a corner, or deuiſed by the braine of any Licurgus, Solon, or Numa Pompilius, pretending the conference and counſell of ſome diuine power, to gaine authority vnto them; but by the whole ſtate of the kingdome aſſembled in Parliament, the Lords ſpirituall and temporall, with the Commons, a ſelect company, gathered out of the wiſeſt, ſageſt, and diſcreteſt perſons of the whole land: and that which is the happineſſe of this kingdome aboue others, not raſhly or ſuddenly, but after mature and graue deliberation: neither by the Prince alone, without his ſubiects, nor the ſubiects alone, without their Prince, but by both conſenting, ſubſcribing, ratifying, and approouing the ſame. Now doe they imagine any man to bee ſo ſimple, as vpon their bare word to condemne Lawes, thus made as vniuſt, and not rather to condemne them as vniuſt ſlanderers, and impudent ſycophants, that thus rage againſt a whole ſtate, vpon a priuat malitious ſpirit? eſpecially ſeeing no Law bee it neuer ſo iuſt, doth pleaſe the humour of malefactors, that would gladly liue without Law, that their wickedneſſe might goe vnpuniſhed: for the Law Iulia could not pleaſe adulterers, nor the Law Cornelia murtherers, nor the Law Reminia promooters: and yet theſe Lawes were neuer the worſe for that ſuch malefactors diſliked them; but they rather the more deſperate, for accuſing the Lawes of iniuſtice: as if a theefe condemned of a robbery, ſhould cry out that the Law was vniuſt, by which hee was condemned: ſo theſe fellowes being guilty of treaſon againſt the Prince and ſtate, haue no wayes to cloake themſelues, but with this out-cry, the Lawes are vniuſt; whereas they ſhould rather keepe themſelues

innocent, and then the Lawes would neuer take no hold of them.
               45. Secondly, if it bee true which Thomas Aquinas ſayth, that then Lawes are ſaid to bee iuſt; firſt, when they are made
                  
                     Aquin. 1. 2. q. 96 art. 24. 
                  for the common good: ſecondly, when they exceed not his power that maketh them; and thirdly, when they haue their due forme, to wit, when the burthens are impoſed on the ſubiect, with a certaine equality of proportion in order to the common good: then our Lawes are iuſt and good Lawes; for they are made by full authority in Parliament, they tend to the conſeruation of the Kings Maieſty, and whole Common-wealth in tranquillity and peace: and their penalties are ſo proportioned, that by the gentle puniſhment of ſome few, the whole ſtate is preſerued.
               46. Thirdly, they themſelues were occaſioners at leaſt, if not cauſers of thoſe Lawes that were made againſt them: for the Bull of Pius Quintus, which came roaring into this land, in the tenth yeere of Queene Elizabeth, whereby the Queene was accurſed, and depoſed, and her ſubiects diſcharged of their obedience and oath, was the root of all this miſchiefe: for it cauſed the firſt Lnw made, anno 13. Elizabeth, and not onely gaue occaſion to it, but bred recuſancy in ordinary Romaniſts, which vſed to come to Church before time, and ſedition and rebellion in the Prieſts and Ieſuites, and ſome eminent perſons; yea and manifold bloudy practices, by treaſon againſt her Maieſties ſacred perſon, and the ſtate. Theſe perilous effects procured other Lawes to be deuiſed, more ſeuere and ſtrict then the former, againſt recuſants, ſeditions books, Ieſuites and Prieſts, that beeing borne Engliſhmen, ſhould goe beyond ſea, and take vpon them the Romiſh Prieſthood, and ſo returne into theſe dominions to infect her loyal ſubiects with the poyſon of their doctrine: and what were the cauſes, I pray you, ſince his Maieſties comming to the Crowne, of the reuiuing thoſe former ſtatutes, and enlarging them in ſome points; and of the new oath of Allegiance, which hath ſtirred vp ſo many pens to write both for it, and againſt it? were not the treaſonable practices of many Romiſh

male contented perſons? ſure it was high time to countermyne againſt them, by ſome Chriſtian politike Lawes, when their malice was growen to that hight, that they cared not what miſchiefe they wrought, ſo that they might worke their willes: by all which it is euident, that they may thanke themſelues for thoſe Lawes, and not our ſtate, which were drawen vnto the making therof, with vnwilling minds, and more vnwillingly to their execution. So that as according to the old ſaying, Good Lawes ſpring out of euill manners; ſo from the fountaine of theſe fearefull treaſons, horrible rebellions, and bloudy practices, ſprung all theſe Lawes which they ſo calumniate.
               47. Fourthly, the Lawes thus occaſioned by their owne villany, doe not run vpon them with violence, but they deſperatly runne vpon the point of the Lawes: for if they keepe themſelues at home in quiet, they might enioy the liberty of their Conſcience, without any danger from the Lawes, ſaue only a gentle mulct impoſed vpon them, for refuſing to communicate with vs in the ſeruice of our Church: and if like fugitiue children they ſhould flee from their own naturall mother, vnto a ſtep-dame in forraine Countreyes, and there receiue vpon them not onely the Character of Romiſh Prieſthood, but alſo into them the poyſon of treaſon, they might ſtay there ſtill, without any coaction from the Lawes: for they were directed onely againſt ſuch as beeing prieſted, returned into their countrey to practiſe treaſon, and to withdraw the peoples hearts from their obedience, and reconcile them to the Church of Rome. So that the Law is but like a naked ſword, held foorth by the hand of the ſtate for it own defence, which theſe deſperate Prieſts run voluntarily vpon, and kill themſelues: and therefore they themſelues are guilty of ſelfe-murder, and not the Law of iniuſtice.
               48. Fiftly, and laſtly, this matter may be yet more euident, all men know that there was neuer any Law hitherto enacted in this kingdome, to put to death any Romaniſt for his Religion; except hee either paſſed ouer the Seas, and returned backe with the order of Prieſt-hood, his heart beeing full of

treaſon, and his hands of violence, as was ſaid before, or gaue entertainment to ſuch traytours in his houſe a certaine time, that lurked for an opportunity to doe miſchiefe, or moued ſeditions or rebellion in the State, let them name but one in theſe 57. yeares of our late Queens and now Kings regiment, that hath been puniſhed with death meerely for his religion, and wee will confeſſe them not to be ſuch malicious ſlanderers, albeit in truth to puniſh Idolaters, and ſuch as perſwade to an Apoſtacy from God, with death, is no vniuſt law, but euen grounded vpon the law of God it ſelfe, Deut. 13. 5. 8, 9. our lawes then are ſo farre from exceeding the bounds of iuſtice, that they rather offend in comming too ſhort thereof, which indeed is the leſſe offence of the two, becauſe it approcheth neerer to the medium; and that our Law-giuers knew right well, which moued them to be rather too remiſſe, then too extreame.
               49. Adde hereunto that all of them, both prieſts and people, that are abſolute Papiſts, muſt needs nouriſh ſecret treaſon in their hearts, whatſoeuer they pretend in outward ſhew, for euery true Romaniſt is bound to obey the Ieſuite or Prieſt, informing him vpon paine of damnation; and the Ieſuite errant muſt obey the Preſident reſident of his Colledge, and be at his direction, and the Colledge Gouernour muſt obey his ſuperiour of the order, and he fetcheth his influence from the Pope, ſo that if the Pope being the higheſt Spheare moue in a violent motion, and command to depoſe or kill the King, as Pius Quintus did our late Queene, then all the inferiour Spheares muſt be caried about with the ſame kind of agitation, and if they make either a trembling or retrograde motion, they are not fit Planets for the Romiſh Spheare, and thus in Queene Elizabeths time all the rabble of them, I meane both Prieſts and abſolute lay Papiſts were traytors either in heart, or act, becauſe the firſt mouer by his Bull moued that wayes, and ſo if they are not at this day by refuſing the oath of allegiance, yet if the Pope ſhould ſhoot out his thunderbolt, and actually excommunicate and depoſe our King, they muſt needs either renounce their allegiance, or their

Romiſh faith, which bindeth them to this neceſſity; albeit moſt of their owne Doctors confeſſe that the King is excommunicate

               50. Touching cruelty in perſecution of them (which is the ſecond crime whereof they accuſe the gouernment of our ſtate) it is ſo ſhameleſſe an accuſation, and ſo farre from ſhew of truth, that there is none that either dwell amongſt vs, or that know the mild and gentle adminiſtration of this common-wealth, but will with one voyce and verdict condemne it for a notorious ſlander. But for further direction of them in this point, and for ſtopping of the mouthes of thoſe malicious perſons, that out of the rancour of their hearts towards vs haue vttered forth theſe vntruths, let theſe few obſeruations be remarked, firſt, that neuer any of them hath bin put to death in this kingdome, but by forme of iuſtice and due proceeding according to the lawes, whereas the Proteſtants haue bin ſlaine by them partly by treaſon, and partly by maſſacres, and that in great multitudes, as is before declared.
               51. Secondly, that ſuch as haue thus by law been executed amongſt vs were ſo handled, not for their religion, but either for treaſon or rebellion, or ſome other notable crime, which to be true, this one reaſon doth ſufficiently prooue, becauſe there was no law euer yet made in this land to puniſh Romiſh recuſants by death, if they kept themſelues within the limits of their religion, and did not flye either beyond ſea, and there become Prieſts, or remayning at home, entertaine ſuch perſons into their houſes, and mayntaine them againſt the State: whereas they on the other ſide haue committed to the edge of the ſword, and the fury of the fire infinite Proteſtants onely for their religion, without any other crime or cauſe layd to their charge, as the ſix Articles in Henry the eights time, and the miſerable burning of many poore ſoules in Queene Maries
                  
quinquenie, onely for denying to ſubſcribe to the doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, doth apparently euince.
               53. Thirdly, that in all Queene Elizabeths time by the ſpace of 44. yeares and vpwards, there were executed in all not aboue 180. Prieſts, receiuers and harbourers of them: and ſince king Iames came to the Crowne of the latter ſort not any, and of the former not much aboue a dozen, (I ſpeake within compaſſe) except thoſe Powder-villaines, who they themſelues dare not for ſhame but confeſſe that they receiued a iuſt reward for their demerits, whereas in Queene Maryes fiue yeares raigne, neere vpon three hundred perſons were cruelly put to death for religion, as the publicke actes and records of our Church do teſtifie. Fourthly, that all the puniſhment inflicted vpon our recuſants, if they kept themſelues peaceable and quiet from actuall treaſon, and entertainement of traytors, was, and is, but a pecuniary mu
                     •
                  ct, and that ſo gentle, that there is ſufficiently left vnto them to mayntaine themſelues and their families in good eſtate, except either they ſeeke to ſeduce others, or refuſe to abiure the land, being conuicted and paſt hope of amendment, or denye to

Elizab. anno 21. & 35. & Iacob. 4. take the oath of allegeance being offered vnto them: their goods are not confiſcate, their bodyes not impriſoned, their perſons not baniſhed, their liues are not taken from them, onely a certaine portion of their lands and goods is forfeited, and that redeeme a number of them at a low and eaſie rate, what puniſhment could be more remiſſe, whereas when the ſword was in their hands, as now vnder the bloudy Inquiſition; not a ſmall mulct, but a proſcription; not goods, but liues; not reſtraint, and limitation, but impriſonment, bonds, and vtter ruine and deſtruction doth ſerue their turne.
               54. Fiftly, that many of their Biſhops and Prieſts haue not onely been freed from all ſeuere puniſhment, but alſo intreated after a kind and fauourable manner: to begin with the late Queenes raigne, of fourteene Biſhops that withſtood herVide Epiſcop. Elien. K

their perſons, vnleſſe they account this a reſtraint, to be committed to the free cuſtodie of their friends, as ſome of them were, and liued in great eaſe and abundance all their life, and dyed with age or ſickneſſe, as nature required, and not by any extremity of iuſtice ſhewed vnto them. Three of their owne accord forſooke the kingdome, not being inforced by any ſuperiour command: and two, to wit, Watſon of Lincolne, and Boner of London, were committed to priſon, but ſo, that in their priſons they wanted nothing that either might ſerue for neceſſity or pleaſure, liberty onely excepted; then after about the middle of her raigne, Hart and Boſgraue, and Riſhton, and Norton, foure Ieſuites, being in the hands of the State, and deſeruing by the lawes to be puniſhed, yet by denying that one vnconcluded article of the Popes omnipotent Supremacy in temporall matters, obtained of her Maieſty not onely life and freedome from puniſhment, but liberty and free power to diſpoſe of themſelues in any forreine countrey at their pleaſures; and at the latter end of her mercifull reigne, the Caſtles of Wiſhbiſh and Fremingham, wherein diuers of their chiefeſt ring-leaders were in cuſtody, do beare witneſſe how mildely they were dealt withall, their life hauing been there more eaſie and pleaſant, and their maintenance more plentifull then moſt of the Students and Miniſters among vs in their beſt proſperity.
               55. Neither hath our vertuous King ſince his rightfull poſſeſſing of the imperiall crowne of theſe vnited kingdomes, been any whit more ſharp and ſeuere, but rather more gentle and remiſſe, vntil their helliſh Powder-plot wrung from him, and the State ſome ſmall addition to theſe former lawes, yet farre remote from all bloudy or cruell purpoſe againſt them. For to omit his Maieſties exceeding clemency extended to them all in the beginning of his raigne, pardoning ſome, aduancing others to dignities & offices in the common-wealth, releaſing the fines and mulcts to all, and giuing by his Proclamation free liberty to all Ieſuites and Seminary Prieſts, to be free from the penalty of the Lawes, ſo that they departed the kingdome within a certaine preſcribed time; euen at this

day, and euer ſince his Maieſties royall regiment, thoſe Prieſts that haue been apprehended and might iuſtly be put to death by tenour of the lawes, yet haue and might be pardoned, if they would but renounce the Popes temporall ſoueraignetie, and receiue the oath of alleageance, as the example of Blackwell their Arch-prieſt, and of diuers beſides doth teſtifie.
               56. Thus gently are they handled with vs, and yet they complaine, whereas when they were armed with authority, all the Biſhops and Miniſters that refuſed to conforme themſelues to their religion, preſently either were apprehended, impriſoned, burned, and moſt cruelly and tyrannically vſed, or conſtrained to forſake the kingdome, and ſeeke reliefe and ſuccour in forreine countries, there was no remedy nor releaſement but either deny their faith, or dye, chooſe they which.
               57. And for their dealing at this day, where the Inquiſition preuaileth, is any one ſuffred to liue among them that is but once ſuſpected to be of our religion? is not euery ſuch a one either murdered in ſecret, or brought to the ſtake in publick? the miſerable butchery that is made of poore Proteſtants by theſe tigres, is lamentable to ſpeake, and almoſt incredible to be beleeued, and were it death onely it might be accounted a fauour, but to be ſtripped not onely of all a mans goods, but alſo of his apparell, and a poore Beadles threed-bare gowne to be put on his back, and to be releeued by almes, as famous Cranmer the Archbiſhop of Canterbury was, to be almoſt ſtarued with cold, and eaten with lice, as deuout Latimer was, to be kept in a cloſe ſtinking filthy priſon, hauing for his bed a little pad of ſtraw, with a rotten couering, as worthie Hooper was, to be whipt, and ſcourged, and ſtockt, and pend vp in Little eaſe, as diuers were by bloudy Bonner: theſe cruelties were more cruell then death, and yet theſe were the mercies of thoſe mercileſſe tyrants; yea, they not onely raged againſt the liuing, but the dead alſo, for they cauſed the bones of Bucer and Fagius to be raked out of their graues, and to be burned for Heretikes: a practiſe many times vſed by Popes, and Romiſh Prelates, which notwithſtanding the very Heathen

               58. Now if it be a kinde of mercy to diſpatch one quickly that muſt dye, what mercy is this in theſe men, that inflict ſo many deaths vpon poore Proteſtants, euen whilſt they liue?Plutarch. and if as Plutarch ſayth, Nemo niſi malus loculos mortuorum violabit; none but hee that is wicked will wrong the ſepulchres of the dead: what wicked wretches are theſe, and cruell beaſts, that ſpare not the dead bones, not feare to offer violence to our graues? and yet for all this they are not aſhamed to accuſe vs of perſecuting them, and to call our handling of them, by the name of a moſt cruell and terrible perſecution:Breue Pauli Quinti. anno 1606.

               59. Now then out of all theſe obſeruations, drawen from the Lawes and Statutes of this Realme, and from the comparing of their dealing towards vs, with ours towards them, this concluſion doth neceſſarily ariſe, that theirs is the bloudy and perſecuting malignant Church, and not ours▪ and that by their malicious imputing to vs that great crime, they prooue themſelues to bee open and notorious ſlanderers, and ſo to perſecute vs not onely with the ſword, but alſo with their vemous

tongues, which according to the Prophet Dauids ſpeech are ſharper then razours, and more virulent then the the ſting of the Aſpe, or poyſon of the Cocatrice; I pray God amend them, and lay not this ſinne to their charge.
               60. The third obiect of their ſlauudering tongues, is our4. Religion it ſelfe, with the doctrines therein contained, where their practice is either to deriue ſophiſticall concluſions, from ſuch points of doctrine, which we indeed held: or to ſay to our charges ſuch doctrines as we neuer intended: and theſe falſe forged concluſions, they make ſhow to extract out of our owne bookes: but it is either by miſtaking the meaning of the Author, or by wilfull peruerting his wordes and ſenſe: or at leaſt by culling ſome incoherent ſentences heere and there, that ſee me to make for their purpoſe, contrary to the whole ſcope and drift of the writer: or laſtly, by blemiſhing our whole Religion by ſome ſiniſter or exorbitant opinion, maintained by ſome one or other, vnaduiſed fellow, though it bee contrary to the whole current of all other writers on our ſide: as if for one mans errour wee were all flat Heretikes; or becauſe one ſouldier playeth the daſtard, therefore the whole army were cowards. Theſe bee their tricks of Legerdemaine, by which they indeuour to diſgrace our Religion, and to countenance their owne: but 
                     Ʋeritas magna eſt, & preualebit. I hope ſo to diſpell and ſcatter theſe miſts by the light of truth, that they ſhall vaniſh like ſmoake, and the truth bee more reſplendent, like the Sunne comming out of a cloud.
               61. To the purpoſe: firſt, they exclaime that our Religion1. Concil. Trid. Bell. de Iuſtif. l. 4. c. 1. Kelliſon. ſuruey.
                   is an enemy to good workes, and that wee eſteeme of them as not neceſſary to ſaluation; which damnable errour, ſome of them aſcribe vnto vs, as our direct doctrine, others as a conſequence of our doctrine, and our ſecret meaning: but that both are lying ſlanders, I appeal firſt to our doctrine it ſelfe, which is ſo cleare in this point, that no man can doubt thereof, but hee that is muſled with malice: for this we hold, that though faith be alone in the worke of iuſtification,Grauida bonorum operum. yet that ſaith euer worketh through loue: and is great with

good workes, as a woman with child, which it bringeth forth alſo when occaſion ſerueth: and that if it bee diſioyned from good workes, it is but a dead carkas of faith, yea the faith ofMelancthon. lib. de viſit. Saxon. Chemnit. loc. cap. de oper. renat. Caluin. Inſtit. l. 1 c. 16. Polan. theſ. de bonis operib. nu. 14. Luther. in Gen. c. 12. Deuils and hypocrites, and not of the elect. And this as it is the conſtant doctrine of all our diuines: ſo is it principally of Luther, whom our aduerſaries accuſe as the chiefeſt enemy to good workes: for thus hee writeth in one place touching the efficacy of faith: Faith is a liuely and powerfull thing, not an idle cogitation, ſwimming vpon the toppe of the heart: as a fowle vpon the water, but as water heated by fire, though it remaine water ſtill, yet it is no more cold, but hote, and altogether changed: ſo faith doth frame and faſhion in a man another mind, and other
                  Idem Ibid. c. 22. 
                  ſenſes, and altogether maketh him a new man. Again in another place he ſayth, that the vertue of faith is to kill death, to damne hell, to be ſinne to ſinne, and a deuill to the deuill: that is, to be ſins poiſon, and the Deuils confuſion. Thus hee ſpeaketh concerning the powerful efficacy of that true iuſtifying faith which wee rely our ſaluation vpon, and they condemne as a nulli-fidian portion. And touching good works, their neceſſity and excellency, heare how diuinely he writeth in one place: Out of the cauſe of iuſtification, no man can ſufficiently commend good workes: in another, One good worke, proceeding from faith, done by a Chriſtian, is more pretious then heauen or earth, the whole

                  diligently vrge the doctrine of good workes, as the doctrine of faith, for the Deuill is an enemy to both: what can bee ſpoken more effectually for the extolling of the excellency of good w

                  : and yet theſe fellowes make Luther the greateſt aduerſarie to them.
               62. Secondly, I appeale to themſelues, many of the greateſt Doctors, amongſt whom doe cleare vs from that imputation: Maldonate. The Proteſtants doe ſay, that iuſtifying

                  faith cannot bee without good workes: Viega. The Proteſtants affirme, that iustification & ſanctification are ſo ioyned together, that they cannot be parted: Stapleton: All Proteſtants, none excepted, teach, that faith which iustifieth, is liuely working by charity,
                  
                  and other good workes. Laſtly Bellarmine. The ProteſtantsBell. de Iuſtif. l 4. c.

Now then, with what face can they bolſter out this ſlaunder againſt our doctrine, and accuſe vs to be like the Simonian Heretike, who taught, that a man need not regard good workes: and Eunomians, who defended, that perſeuerance in ſinne, did not hinder ſaluation, ſo that wee beleeued. This is the firſt blaſphemie againſt our Religion, wherein they doe not ſo much thwart vs, as croſſe themſelues: and that one may ſee yet more clearely, this to bee a malicious ſlaunder: hearken what Bellarmine

                  but from opinion of workes, that is, from a fooliſh preſumption of iuſtification, to bee obtained by workes: by all which we may eaſily iudge of the meaning of thoſe ſentences obiected: (Faith alone doth ſaue: and infidelity alone doth condemne: and where faith is, no ſinne can hurt nor condemne:) that they are to be vnderſtood, partly of ſinnes before iuſtification, and partly of ſuch ſinnes after, as deſtroy not faith, nor raigne in the beleeuer, nor are perſeuered in, but repented of, and laboured againſt, and thus our Religion is iuſtified by the very aduerſaries thereof, from this great crime imputed vnto it.
               63. Againe, they accuſe vs as maintainers of this doctrine,2. Bell. de Iuſtif. l. 4. c. 1. Luther. in aſſert. art. 31. 32. 36. Calum Inſtit l. 3 c. 12. &. l. 4. c. 9. Melanct. loc. de peccat.
                   that all the workes of iuſt men, are mortall ſinnes, and of this they make, Luther, Calume, and Melancthon to be Patrones: but with what ſhameleſſe impudency, let the world iudge. To begin with Caluine, theſe be his words: Dum ſancti ductu Spiritus, &c. (i.) Whilſt being holy▪ wee walke in the wayes of the Lord, yet leaſt being forgetfull of our ſelues, wee ſhould waxe proud, there remain reliques of imperfection, which may minister
                  
                  vnto vs, matter of humiliation: againe, the beſt worke that can be wrought by iuſt men, yet is beſprinkled and corrupted with the impurity of the fleſh, and hath as it were ſome dregs mixed with it: let the holy ſeruant of God chuſe out of his whole life, that which he ſhall thinke to haue beene moſt excellent, let him well conſider euery part thereof, hee ſhall without doubt finde in one place or other, ſomething which ſauours of the fleſhes corruption, ſeeing our alacrity in well doing is neuer ſuch as it ought to be, but our weakenes great in hindering the courſe: although we ſee that the blots, where with the Saints workes are ſtayned, are not obſcure, yet grant that they are but very ſmall workes, ſhall they not offend the eyes of God, before whom the ſtarres themſelues are not pure? we haue not one worke proceeding from the Saints, which if it be cenſured in it ſelfe, doth not deſerue a iuſt reproofe..
               
               64. In the other place obiected, hee writeth thus: Qui ſeriò tanquam ſub conſpectu Dei, &c. (i.) They which ſhall earneſtly as in the ſight of God, ſeeke the true rule of iuſtice, ſhall finde for certainty all the words of men, if they be cenſured by their owne dignity, to be nothing but pollution and filthines: and that which is commonly called righteouſneſſe, to be before God meere iniquity: that which is counted integrity, to be impurity, and that which is eſteemed glory, to be ignominie. Let the Reader now iudge what notorious lyars theſe bee to faſten this opinion vpon Caluin, whoſe wordes I haue ſincerely and fully ſet downe, that euery one may ſee their falſe dealing: for in what one place nameth hee mortall ſinne? or what one word tendeth to that end? The worſe termes he
                     •
                   giueth to good workes in the firſt place are theſe: That they are ſprinkled with imperfection, mixed with the dregs of the ſleſh, ſtained with corruption: and in the ſecond, that they are filthines, iniquity, pollution and ignominy: but how? firſt, if they bee examined by the ſtrict rule of Gods iuſtice: ſecondly, if they bee compared to Gods righteouſneſſe: and thirdly, if they bee conſidered in their owne merite and worth without the merite of Chriſt, whereby both their ſtaines and imperfections are couered, and an excellent dignity giuen vnto them.
               65. And indeed what I pray you doth Caluine ſay herein,

but that which the Fathers ſaid before? I will propound two or three vnto you in ſtead of al the reſt: Woe be to our righteouſneſſe (ſayth Saint Auguſtine) if God remouing his mercy, ſhould ſearch into it: and againe, All our righteouſnes ſtandeth rather in the remiſſion of our ſinnes, then in any perfection of iuſtice. Our beſt righteouſnes (ſayth Saint Bernard) if it be any, is right perhaps, but not pure, vnleſſe happily we thinke our ſelues better then our Fathers, who no leſſe truely then humbly ſaid, All our righteouſnes is as a defiled cloth. The holy man Iob (ſayth Saint Gregory) becauſe he ſaw all the merite of our vertue to be in vice, if it be ſtrictly iudged by the eternall Iudge, did rightly adde in; If I will contend with him, I ſhall not be able to anſwere him one of a thouſand. Laſtly, all beauty (ſayth Arnobius) in Gods preſence is but deformity, all righteouſnes is but vnrighteouſness, all ſtrength but weakenes, all riches but beggery. Theſe Fathers, with all the reſt, ſay no leſſe then Caluine, nor Caluine no more then they; and therefore they muſt either bee condemned with him, or bee iuſtified with them. Now if any man ſhould ſay, that they affirmed, that our beſt works were deadly ſinnes, all men would condemne him for a liar: ſo may we iuſtly ſay of our malicious aduerſaries, in imputing that opinion to Caluine, which hee neuer meant, nor yet the words will beare, and alſo which in all his writings hee directly croſſeth.
               66. That which hath beene ſpoken concerning, Caluine, may bee applyed to the iuſtification of Luther and Melancthon: who are ſo farre from eſteeming good workes, to bee mortall ſinnes, that they extoll them hyperbolically, as hath beene already manifeſted. Luther indeed ſayth thus: That a good worke, done after the beſt manner that can be, yet is a veniall ſinne, according to the mercy of God, and a mortall ſinne, according to the iuſtice of God: but what of this? doth he therefore ſay, that it is a mortall ſinne, ſimply, as they would haue him? no, in no caſe: for firſt, hee calleth it a good worke, which hee would neuer haue done, if hee had iudged it no better then a ſinne: ſecondly, hee ſayth, that it is mortall, according to the iuſtice of God, and veniall by the mercy of

God, which is the very ſame that all the Fathers affirmed before, intending by mortall, not that which is a high degree of ſinne, but that which in it owne nature deſerueth death. Thirdly, Luther himſelfe ſheweth what his intendment is in the article going before, where he ſayth, that not the good worke it ſelfe, but the defect in the worke is truely ſinne, becauſe it is an omiſſion of that precept, Thou ſhalt loue the Lord thy God with all thy heart. By all which it is cleare, that Luther doth not condemne a good worke, but the euil in the worke, and that though God doth in mercy pardon the euill for the goods ſake, being a fruit of faith, ſo he might iuſtly condemne the good for the euill ſake that cleaueth vnto it, being a fruit of originall ſinne: ſo that Luther ſtandeth cleare and innocent from this crime layd to his charge in all true iudgement, and they ſtand guilty of a moſt foule ſlander imputed vnto him by their malice.
               67. Thirdly, they ſlaunder vs, that we ſlaunder God, by making him the author of ſinne. This accuſation, Bellarmine, Campion, Stapleton, Vaſques, Feuardentius, and all the Ieſuiticall rabble lay to our charge. And they accuſe Caluine, Luther, Peter Martir, and all other Proteſtant-writers as guilty thereof, but vpon what ground, and with what ſhew of reaſon, let them declare vnto vs, for it paſſeth the reach of our capacities to finde out any ſuch doctrine, either direct in plaine words, or indirect by logicall conſequence in any of them; direct doctrine I am ſure Caluine thus writeth: The cauſe of ſinne is not to be ſought out of mans will, out of which the roote of euill ariſeth, and in the which ſinne reſideth. And in his Comment vpon the Epiſtle of Saint Iames, more plainely he affirmeth, that God is not the author of ſinne, and that euils doe not proceed from any other roote, but from the euill concupiſcence of euery mans owne heart. And this doctrine he iterateth againe and againe many ſcore of times in his bookes. Peter Martyr in like maner is moſt direct againſt this blaſphemousPet. Mart▪ com. in 2. Sam. 16. 22. doctrine, for thus he ſaith, That opinion of the Libertines which maketh God the author of ſinne, is a moſt deteſtable opinion, then which, nothing can be imagined more wicked, nor a more compendious
                  
                  way to hell; And in the ſame place he concludeth, that though nothing in the world, no, not ſinnes themſelues come to paſſe beſides Gods will and prouidence, yet he is not truly to be called the cauſe of ſinne, but all that can be ſayd, is that he is ſuch a cauſe, which is tearmed by the Logicians, the remoouing or hindering cauſe, that is, not efficient, but deficient rather, which in truth is no cauſe at all. Luther is as direct: for he auoucheth this propoſition in many places, God is not the author of ſinne.

               68. I but (ſay they) though in word you ſay ſo, yet by conſequence from your doctrine it may be neceſſarily gathered, that you hold the contrary: for you all teach, that God concurreth with a ſinner in the acting of his ſin by his powerfull prouidence, and not onely foreſeeth, but decreeth, diſpoſeth, and determineth in his wiſedome all the ſinnes of men according to his will; and by his ſecret working blindeth their minds, and hardneth their hearts, that they cannot repent. This we confeſſe is our doctrine, if it be rightly vnderſtood: for we teach, that God doth not barely permit ſinne to be done, but decreeth before to permit it, and in the act worketh by it, and ordereth and diſpoſeth it to his owne ends, yet ſo, that he neither approueth of it, nor is in any reſpect the cauſe of the malignity thereof; and herein we conſent both with the ancient Fathers, and with moſt of their owne Doctors.

This is the very doctrine of Caluine, and Martir, and all Proteſtants: ſo that if wee be guilty of this blaſphemous conſequence, to make God the author of ſinne, they alſo muſt needs be in the ſame caſe: but Saint Augustines diſtinction will cleere vs both.

                     Ʋaſques) the act and defect:

                  the act is to be referred to God, but not the defect in any caſe, which ariſeth from the corrupt will of man: or the act and the malignity thereof, (as ſayth another Ieſuite) or the materiall part of ſinne, which is called by the Schoolemen, ſubiectum ſubſtratum, the vnder-laide ſubiect: and the formall, which is the prauity and anomy of the action; the one of theſe from God, the other from man: or laſtly, if none of theſe will ſerue the turne, yet our owne diſtinction will acquire vs, to wit, that Almighty God doth ſo will & decree mans ſin, not as it is ſin, but as it is his owne iuſt iudgement vpon ſinners, for their puniſhment, and the demonſtration of his iuſtice. And thus our doctrine is free from the conception of this vile Monſter, & their calumniation is as vnrighteous againſt vs, as the dealing of God about the ſins of men, is moſt righteous and iuſt. And thus thoſe ſome what too harſh ſayings (I conteſſe) of Luther, Swinglius and Melancthon are to bee vnderſtood, and no otherwiſe, that the treaſon of Iudas came from God, aſwell as the conuerſion of Paul: charity will conſtrue the wordes according to the ſpeakers intendement, and not ſtretch their intendement to the ſtrict tenter of euery word and ſyllable.

                     . ſlander: for neither Caluine nor Beza did euer imagine, much leſſe vtter the ſame in that ſenſe which they lay to their charges: for let Bellarmine their ſworne aduerſarie ſpeake for them: Caluine and Beza teach (ſayth he) that the Sonne is of himſelfe in respect of his eſſence, but not in reſpect of his perſon, and they ſeeme to ſay, that the eſſence of the Deity in Chriſt, is not begotten, but is of it ſelfe: which opinion (ſayth he) I ſee not why it may not be called Catholike. Heere Bellarmine telleth

vs truely, what their opinion was, and doth acknowledge it to be a true Catholike doctrine: and yet in the ſame Chapter hee contemneth Caluine, for his manner of ſpeaking of it, and of intolerable ſaucineſſe, for finding fault with the harſhnes of the phraſe vſed by the Nicene Councill, God of God: Light of light. Marke (I pray you) his abſurdity, it is Catholike, and yet it may not bee ſpoken: it is true, and yet it is to be blamed. May not a Catholike doctrine bee ſpoken then? or muſt the truth bee ſmothered? This is ſuch an inconſequence, as neither reaſon nor Religion can any wayes beare withall: and for his ſaucy dealing with the Nicene Councill, all that euer he ſayth is, that it is durum dictum, a hard phraſe: yet ſo, that hee confeſſeth it may receiue a good and commodious interpretation, if it be vnderſtood in the concrete, that Chriſt who is God, is of the Father that is God: the word being taken perſonally, and not in the abſtract; as if the eſſence of the Deity of the Sonne ſhould bee from the Father, which is entirely ſubſiſting, in, of, and by it owne eternall, incomprehenſible, and moſt glorious nature: and this without queſtion was the true intendement of the Councill; for els it had not confuted, but fauoured the blaſphemous hereſie of Arrius, againſt whom it was aſſembled, which Caluine and Beza doe not any wayes croſſe, but onely bring vnto it a fit and fauourable expoſition. Thus we haue Bellarmine, Caluines and Bezaes patrone in this doctrine, though full ill againſt his will:Riber. com. in Heb. 1. Gregor. de Valent. de trinit. l. 1. c. 22. & l. 2. c. 17. and not onely him, but Ribera, and Gregory de Valentia, two other no meane Rabbies, both which doe conclude, that the Sonne as he is a perſon, is of another; but as he is a ſimple Ens, is not of another: and that the Eſſence doth not beget the Eſſence, but the Father the Son: ſo that either they are ſlanderers of the truth; or their Catholike doctrines may bee Atheiſme and blaſphemy.
               72. Againe, they accuſe Caluine of another blaſphemy againſt5. Bell. in praefat. controu. de Chriſte. Poſſeuin. de notis diuini verbi, l. 3. p. 78. our Lord and Sauior Ieſus Chriſt, to wit, that he ſhould make him inferiour to his Father, in reſpect of his Deity. This is Arrlaniſme indeed, as Bellarmine calleth it; or Atheiſme, as Poſſeuine, if it were to bee found in Caluines diuinity, or any

other: but it is as farre from him thus to thinke, as it is from their malice to ſpeake the truth. This is all that Caluine affirmeth, that the Father is God, per excellentiam, that is, after a more excellent manner. And what errour I pray you is in this? doth hee not ſpeake of the perſonall relation that is betwixt the Father and the Sonne, and not of the nature and eſſence of the God-head that is in both, of equall dignity and excellency? This is cleare both by the former article, wherein he ſloutly auoucheth him to bee 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   God of himſelfe, and not to receiue the eſſence of his Deity from his Father, and ſo not to be inferiour to his Father in that reſpect: and alſo by infinite places in his books, where he directly maketh the Son Iehouah, equall to the Father in dignity, excellency, eternity, and all other properties of the Deity: therefore he ſpeaketh this in reſpect of the perſon of Chriſt, in which conſideration the Father that begetteth, reſpected with the Sonne that is begotten, may truely bee ſaid to haue a certaine priority of order, ānd to be God after a more excellent manner. Here is now neither Arrianiſme, nor Atheiſme, nor indeed any error in Caluines doctrine; but malicious lying and ſlaundering in in theſe Ieſuites accuſation.
               73. Nay, that Caluine may bee cleared from all ſuſpition of errour, and thoſe fellowes condemned as notorious ſlaunderers:Tollet. com. in Ioh. 14. 
                  Tollet one of their owne fraternity affirmeth, that Athanaſius, Baſil, Nazianzene, Hilary and Origen, all ſtrong maintainers of Chriſts diuinity, and profeſt enemies to Arrius hereſie, interpret that place, Iohn 14. My Father is greater then I: in Caluines ſenſe. Maldonate another Ieſuite, in hisMaldonat. com. in Ioh. 14. commentary vpon Iohn, addeth to theſe, Epiphanius, Cyrillus, Leontius, Chryſoſtome, Theophilact, and Euthemius, as patrones of the ſame opinion: yea, and this laſt Ieſuite himſelfe ſubſcribeth to their expoſition: for he ſayth, that the Father is greater then the Sonne, in that reſpect that hee is the Sonne: for the Name of the Father is more honorable then the Name of the Son: and the Schoolmen ſay aſmuch as Caluine, when they aſcribeEraſm. in praefat. ad libro
                        •
                      Tertul. to the Father authority, and to the Sonne ſubauthority. What is this but to ſay, that the Father is God after a more excellent

manner? Now then if this were neither Atheiſme, nor Arrianiſme, nor hereſie in the Fathers, nor in their owne Doctors: why ſhould it bee branded with thoſe infamous titles in Caluine? I ſee no reaſon, but that malice is blinde, and that the hatred they bare to that good man, made them to ſay, and do they cared not what, ſo they might wound his credite thereby.
               74. Luther is likewiſe traduced by them, as a denyer of the bleſſed Trinity: and that, becauſe the word Trinity is ſaid to diſlike him, for which cauſe he diſpunged out of the Germane Lyturgies, this ſorme of prayer: Sancta Trinitas, vnus Deus, miſerere nostri; a notorious calumniation: for Luther indeed blotteth out of the Germane prayers, a certain forme like vnto that obiected, but not ſo as he ſetteth it downe: for the word vſed in the Germane tongue, ſignifieth rather a triplicity, then a Trinity; which mooued Luther in a deſire to maintaine the pure doctrine of the Trinity (as Iunius obſerueth) to blot out that word, thinking it a dangerous matter, to vſe ſuch a word in ſo holy and high a myſtery. By which practice he is ſo farre from impugning or denying that bleſſed principle, that he ſheweth himſelfe rather a zealous defender and maintainer thereof, and in a word, to diſcouer their falſity and his innocency. Liſt how diuinely, and ſoundly, and orthodoxally he writeth elſe-where of that myſtery: Vnitas Trinitatis

Againe, we beleeue (ſayth he) that there is one God, the Father

A number of ſuch like places might bee alledged out of his workes, wherein moſt conſtantly hee auoucheth that doctrine which our and his vnequall aduerſaries accuſe him to bee an enemy vnto. Let enuy it ſelfe now bee iudge, whether this bee not a ſlander, when as they both falſiſy thoſe ſayings, out of which they would deriue their accuſation, and conceale thoſe which they knew to bee a iuſt defence and apologie for his innocency.

Becauſe they would make him to ſay, that the ſoules of the iuſt are kept in certaine ſecret receptacles, till the day of Iudgement, and doe not till then inioy the preſence of God. Another palpable ſlander: for firſt Caluine doth not ſay ſo: ſecondly, if hee did, yet it doth not follow thereupon, that hee denyeth the immortality of the ſoule: for the firſt, let Caluine firſt ſpeake for himſelfe, and then let his aduerſaries alſo ſpeak for him. Touching the place where the ſoules of the iuſt remaine after death, he affirmeth plainely in diuers places, that they liue with God, and enioy the happy felicity of his kingdome, though

But his concluſion in both is falſe, though the premiſes be true: for as the Atrium, or vtter Court of the Temple, to which Caluine alludeth, was a part of the Temple: ſo by proportion, the vtter Court of Heauen is a part of Heauen: witneſſe their owne Ribera, expoundingRibera i

               78. Againe, that faith which hee ſpeaketh of in the ſecond place, is nothing elſe, but their ſtedfaſt beliefe and expectation of the reſurrection of their bodies, which liueth in the faithfull ſoules ſeparated from this mortality, vntill the full accompliſhment of their happineſſe, aſwell as in the Saints militant: neither can I conceiue any abſurdity in this, that the Saints departed ſhould haue faith in this reſpect, ſeeing they muſt needs haue hope: which two Theologicall vertues are ſo perplexed together, that one cannot bee without the other: and therefore Clemens Alexandrinus calleth hope the blood of faith: and Saint Paul ſayth, 1. Cor. 13. that faith and hope ſhall ceaſe together, when charity ſhall ſuruiue and remaine. If then the Saints departed hope for the reſurrection of their bodies, why may they not bee ſaid alſo to beleeue it, and yet for all that be in heauen too?
               79. Neither is the other place obiected out of Caluine by
                     Caluin. Inſtit. l. 3. c. 25. §. 6. 
                  Bellarmine any whit repugnant to this doctrine; for though he ſayth, that it is a fooliſh and raſh part to diſpute curiouſly, what the place is, that the Saints poſſeſſe in Heauen, and whether they inioy the full ioyes of heauen, or no: yet in the very ſame place hee affirmeth, that they are in the preſence of Chriſt in Paradiſe, and that they onely expect the fruition of that promiſed glory, which their bodies alſo ſhalbe poſſeſſors of, at the comming of Chriſt.
               80. Thus we haue heard Caluine ſpeake for himſelfe. Let vs now heare his enemies, ſpeaking for him in this caſe, then which there cannot be a ſtronger argument of his innocency:Bell. de Chriſt
                        •
                     . l. 4. c. 15. and in this, two may ſtand for all. Bellarmine is the firſt, hee directly confeſſeth, that Caluine placed the ſoules of the Saints in heauen, euen before the comming of Chriſt; and to him ſubſcribeth Fenardentius, another Ieſuite, who affirmeth that thisFeuard. Theomach. l. 8. c. 8. was Caluines opinion, that the faithfull, when they ſhould depart out of this world, doe behold God neere vnto them, and as it were ſet before their eyes. And thus Caluine is quit from this

enditement by the witneſſe of his profeſt aduerſaries.
               81. Secondly, let it be granted (which neuertheleſſe can no wayes be prooued) that Caluine held this opinion, touching the reſidence of ſoules in ſome ſecret place; yet it doth not follow, that therefore he denyed the immortality of the ſoule. For then Origen, Iustine, Martyr, Tertullian, Irenaeus,
                  
                     Vaſques tom. 1. in Thom. diſp. 19 c. 1. nu. 1. Staplet. de author. Script. l. 1. c 2. Sixt. Senenſ. biblioth. l. 9. 
                  Lactantius, Victorinus, Chryſostome, Theodoret, Theophilact, Ambroſe, Bernard, and diuers others of the ancient godly Fathers, ſhould be enwrapped within the ſame errour, who all held that opinion touching ſoules departed, and yet were as farre from gain-ſaying, or once imagining any oppoſition to the ſoules immortality, as theſe backbiting Shemi
                     •
                  s are from charity and truth.
               82. Another lowde and lewde ſlander of theirs againſt our Religion, is, that it maintaineth and warranteth rebellion and diſobedience againſt lawfull Princes. Which if they could prooue, wee would confeſſe that our Religion was naught, ſeeing Gods word commandeth euery ſoule to be ſubiect
                  Rom. 13. 1. 
                  to the higher powers: but yet not worſe then theirs, which is, without all contradiction, guilty of this crime, which they impute vnto vs, as hath beene prooued: but let vs heare their proofes: they are of two ſorts; firſt, from the doctrines of ſome of our learned writers; and ſecondly, from the practice of our profeſſors: In the firſt kind they obiect Caluine, Beza, Luther, Knox, Buchanan, Goodman; yea and Munſter alſo with his Anabaptiſts: all which let vs briefly examine, and begin with the laſt, and ſo goe backward.
               83. Munſter with his Anabaptiſts, maintained indeed ſuch rebellious doctrines: but were they Proteſtants? or did euer any Proteſtant giue credit, coūtenance or allowāce vnto thē? No, Bellarmine himſelfe confeſſeth the contrary, when hee ſayth, that the opinion of the hereticall Anabaptiſts, was abhorred
                  Bell. de Laicis l. 3. c. 2. 
                  not onely of Catholikes, but alſo of Caluine. Yea Caluine and Luther wrote each of them a booke againſt their impieties. It is impious wickedneſſe then for any to obiect to Proteſtants, the opinion of thoſe rebellious and giddy Anabaptiſts.
               
                  84. Touchng Goodman, Knox and Buchanan, we ingeniouſly confeſſe, that the two laſt went too farre in diminiſhing the authority of Princes, and that the firſt was impious in animating ſubiects againſt their Soueraignes: but withall, wee giue them to know this, that they are condemned of all good men in this their rebellious aſſertion: and that by a publike Act of Parliament in Scotland, Buchanans books was calledAnno 1584. in, and cenſured as contrary to ſound doctrine: and the like cenſure is giuen by all godly Proteſtants, againſt Knox, or any other that maintaine the like.
               85. And now I would faine vnderſtand of theſe fellowes, what are theſe three in compariſon of the whole Church of Proteſtants, that they ſhould blemiſh our Religion by their exorbitant opinions; and to the many hundred of Proteſtant writers, that abhorre all ſuch doctrine, and clearely auouch the contrary. If it be a good plea in them, to ſay, that the opinion of ſome priuate men ought not to preiudice the Religion of the whole Church; then it may alſo by good right ſerue our turnes in the caſe of theſe three, ſeeing the rule of equity requireth vt feras legem quam fers, that euery one ſhould bee ſubiect to that Law which hee himſelfe maketh. In ſum, here are with vs but three, that can be touched: but with them are multitudes, not onely of inferiour Prieſts and Ieſuites, but of Cardinals and Popes, that are guilty of this crime: ours, are priuate men condemned by all others: with them, publike perſons authorized by their places and chayres, and priuiledged from errour: with vs, writings of no authoritie: with them, Bulles, decrees, and bookes with priuiledge and publike allowance. Laſtly, with vs, the whole ſtreame of our Religion tendeth to the maintenance of obedience, and condemning of all treaſon and rebellion: but with them the very grounds of their Religion doe warrant and vphold the contrary, as is manifeſtly prooued heretofore.
               86. Concerning Luther, Caluine and Beza, how farre they were from this pernicious doctrine, let their owne words and writings teſtify: Luther firſt: Gouernment (ſayth he) is a certaine
                  Luther tom. 5. in Gen. cap. 27. 
                  diuine vertue: and therefore God calleth all Magiſtrates
                  
                  gods, not for creation, but for adminiſtration and gouernment, which belongeth onely to God: therefore he that is a ruler, is as it were a god incarnate. Againe, in another place; We doe not flatter
                  Idem tom. 3. in Gen. cap. 33. 
                  the Magiſtrates, when we ſtile them moſt gracious, and moſt mighty: but from the heart we reuerence their order, and their perſons ordained to this office. And in another place; Though
                  Idem tom. 1. in Gen. cap. 9. 
                  ſome thinke (ſayth he) the gouernment of man ouer man to bee a tyrannous vſurpation; becauſe all men are naturally of like condition: yet we that haue the word of God, muſt oppoſe the commandement and ordinance of God, who hath put a ſword into the hand of the Magiſtrate, whom therefore the Apoſtle calleth Gods Miniſters.
               
               87. Caluine in diuers places deliuereth this doctrine: that
                     Caluin. Inſtit. lib. 4. cap. 20. 
                  not onely good and godly Kings are to be obeyed, but alſo wicked ones, becauſe in them is ſtamped and ingrauen the image of diuine Maieſtie: neyther can any one ſentence be picked and culled out of all his bookes, yea, though it be ſtrayned to the vttermoſt, and wrung till it bleed, that but ſauoureth of rebellion: except that may, perhaps, which hee ſpeaketh concerning an impious King, that riſeth vp againſt God, and ſeeketh to rob him of his right: how ſuch a one doth bereaue
                  Idem com. in Dan. 6. 22. 
                  himſelfe of his authoritie, and is rather to be ſpit at then obeyed. But this alſo being rightly vnderſtood, maketh nothing to that purpoſe: for firſt, he doth not ſay that ſuch an one is to be bereaued of his authoritie, but that he bereaueth himſelfe: and ſecondly he meaneth, that hee is rather to bee ſpit at and defiled, then to be obeyed in that particular, wherein he commandeth any thing contrary to the dignitie and maieſtie of God. What hurt now, I pray you, is in this doctrine? Or rather what ſound truth is not in it? ſaue that there is a little harſhneſſe of phraſe, which might haue beene well omitted: and yet this is all that the Romiſh aduerſaries can charge Caluine withall.
               88. Laſtly, for Beza, if I ſhould produce all his excellent ſayings, whereby he doth maintaine the authority of Princes, and obedience of ſubiects: I ſhould trouble the Reader too long: let this ſuffice, that his greateſt enemies cannot obiect

againſt him, any one thing tending to the impeachment of Royall authoritie, except they groſſely bely him, which is no new thing with them; lyes and ſlanders being one of the chiefe props of their Kingdome. Thus our doctrine affordeth them no hold for this accuſation.
               89. Againe, they challenge Caluine for imputing vnto our Lord and Sauiour ſome ſtaine of ſinne; not by expreſſe words, but by conſequence: becauſe he ſaid, that when in the
                     Bel. de Chriſto lib. 4. cap. 1. garden he prayed, Father, if it be poſſible, let this cuppe paſſe from me, neuertheleſſe, not as I will, but as thou wilt: hee corrected and revoked his prayer ſuddenly vttered: therefore (ſay they) he muſt be tainted with ſinne, ſeeing he did ſomething that might be corrected: the like crime they lay to the charge of Luther, and all other learned Proteſtants, for ſayingIbid. that in Chriſts humane nature there was ſome ignorance reſiding, and that he grew vp, and increaſed in knowledge, and had not the full meaſure of knowledge at his birth, as they would haue it. We grant the premiſes to be true, to wit, that this is the doctrine of Caluine, Luther, and other learned Proteſtants: but neuertheleſſe we ſay, that the concluſion is a malicious ſlander: for firſt, many of the fathers, yea moſt, were of the ſame opinion with vs: as alſo ſome of the popiſh Doctors themſelues, that there was ignorance in Chriſt, and that his knowledge grew and increaſed together with his age, according to that of Saint Luke: Hee increaſed in wiſedome
                  Luk. 2. 52. 
                  and ſtature, and in fauour with God and men. And yet none of them did once imagine, that this was in him either a ſinne or a fruit of ſinne; grounding vpon that text of Scripture, Heb. 4. 15. that Chriſt was like vnto vs in all things, ſinne onely excepted: nor euer was that errour imputed vnto them for that cauſe. Heare ſome of them ſpeake in their owne words. Ambroſe ſayth thus. How Chriſt increaſed in wiſdome
                  Ambroſe de Incar. cap. 7. 
                  the order of the words doth teach, his proceeding in age, is his proceeding in wiſdome. And therefore Saint Luke ſets his growth in age. Firſt, that thou mighteſt know that it is ſpoken of him as he is man. And Chryſoſtome thus, The wiſemen gaue
                  
                     Chryſeſt. in Mat. 2. hom. 2. 
                  honour not to his childhood, vnderſtanding nothing, but to his diuinitie
                  
                  knowing all things: and Maldonate doth confeſſe, thatMaldon. com. in Mat. 24. 
                  Athanaſius, Gregory, Nazianzene, Theodoret, Cyril, and the authour of the imperfect worke on Mathew, did al teach, that Chriſt as man, was ignorant of the day of Iudgement. Neyther do theſe fathers alleadged by Bellar. for the contrarie opinion, in truth deliuer any thing elſe, if they bee rightly vnderſtood: for moſt of them, when they ſay, that our Sauiour was full of grace, knowledge and wiſedome, from his verie conception, and that hee did not increaſe and grow therein as other men, they ſpeake eyther of his perſon in the concret, or of his diuine nature apart, as their owne words alleadged by him doe clearely ſhew. And to this opinion Thomas Aquinas, their grand Schooleman and angellical Doctor, ſetteth
                     Aquin. part. 3. q. 9. art. 4. his hand and ſeale. For thus hee writeth, Though I haue elſewhere written otherwiſe, yet it is to be ſaid (ſayth bee) that in Chriſt there was ſcientia acquiſita: knowledge acquired or gotten, which is properly knowledge according to the meaſure of man: and that not onely in reſpect of the ſubiect receiuing, but alſo of the cauſe agent, &c.
               
               90. Secondly, al ignorance is not ſin by the doctrine of their own ſchoole. For that ignorāce which is called purae negationis of pure negation, doth not oppugne the ſtate of innocencie, ſeeing that it was in Adā
                   before his fal, and is now in the Angels in their perfection, & may be in any without the ſpot of ſin: as witneſſe Lumbard, Aquinas, Pererius & al their learned
                     Perer. com. in Gen. 6. diſp. 4. Suarez. tom. 1. Thom. q. 9. art. 1. diſp. 24. Doctors for the moſt part: yea their Ieſuite Suarez telleth vs, it is not to be called ignorance at al. Becauſe ignorance (ſayth he) doth not ſignifie euery want of knowledge, but the priuatiō of that knowledge, which ought to be in a ſubiect according to the ſtate of the nature thereof: as man is not to bee called ignorant, becauſe he wanteth angellicall knowledge, ſo Chriſt was ignorant of none of theſe things; which was behoofefull for him to know, in reſpect of the dignitie of his perſon: ſo that of two kindes of ignorance, one, of pure negation; that is, when a man knoweth not ſome thing, which hee is not bound to know, and the other of wicked diſpoſition, when a man is 
                     〈…〉
                   of ſomething which he ought to know. This laſt is

a ſinne, but not the firſt: and therefore to ſay that Chriſt was ignorant of ſome things in his humane nature, and that hee increaſed in knowledge, as in age, is not to impute vnto him any blot either of originall or actuall ſinne.
               91. For the other part of the obiection, wherewith Caluine is touched, concerning our Sauiours correcting of his owne ſpeech, it is no other then that which Ierome before him many hundred yeeres vttered; and Origen alſo, two famous fathers of the Primitiue Church: the one affirming, that Chriſt returning to himſelfe, auouched, that as he was the
                  Hierome. Origen. tract. in Mat. 
                  Sonne of God, which hee had ſtaggeringly ſpoken, as hee was a man: the other, that he recalled his deſire, and as it were thinking better vpon it, ſaid, Not as I will: yea they themſelues acknowledge aſmuch, for Bellarmine ſayth, that when our Sauiour
                  
                     Bell. de Chriſt▪ lib. 4. cap. 5. 
                  prayed, Let this cup paſſe from me, but not as I will, but as thou wilt, it was aſmuch as if he ſhould haue ſaid: Volo vt non fiat voluntate naturali quod voluntate deliberata volo vt fiat: I will that it may not come to paſſe, to wit, by my naturall will, which by my deliberate will, I deſire may come to paſſe. Here is a plaine correction, as Caluine calleth it, or a returning to himſelfe, as Hierome; or a reuocation of his natural deſire by a more aduiſed deſire, as Origen: the like interpretation is giuen by Ianſenius, Pererius and Maldonate; all agreeing in t
                     •
                  is, that they admit of a correction and reuocation of his naturall, inferiour, humane wil, by his ſpirituall, ſuperior, diuine will: and yet without all blemiſh and ſuſpition of ſin; this correction preſupoſing no corruption. So that either Caluine muſt be excuſed, or themſelues muſt bee inwrapped within the folds of the ſame fault. But this is their rancour againſt that good man, and all other of our ſide, that which is orthodox in the Fathers, and themſelues, is notwithſtanding hereſie in vs; becauſe they looke vpon vs thorow the ſpectacle of malice, but vpon themſelues with the eyes of ſelfe-loue.
               
               92. And to cleere him altogether, and ridde him out of their hands, the moſt receiued doctrine both by Caluine and
                     Perkins on the Creed. all our whole Church concerning this point is; that this was not in our Sauiour Chriſt, either a rebellion of the ſenſuall

part of the ſoule againſt the rationall; as Per
                        •
                     rius maketh it, which is in the vnregenerate, nor of the fleſh againſt the ſpirit, as Ianſenius would haue it, which is in the regenerate, nor a repugnance of Chriſts will as he was a man, to his will as he was God, which Maldonate ſ
                     •
                  emeth to affirme: but onely the ſtrife of two contrarie deſires in the humane ſoule of Chriſt for dominion, both which notwithſtanding were good and holy, though the one not ſo good as the other, and in that reſpect, this deſire to auoid death, which was the leſſe, might without any great offence, bee ſaid to bee corrected, when it yeelded vnto that other which was more excellent.
               92. Laſtly (to omit a number more of their ſſlanders in this kind) they charge our Religion it ſelfe, to lead to looſeneſſe and ſenſualitie by diuers doctrines thereof: eſpecially theſe foure, to wit, freewill, iuſtification by faith alone, perſeuerance in grace; and impoſſibilitie to keepe the Commandements: but with what ſpirit of malice, let the indifferent Reader conſult and iudge.
               93. Firſt, for our doctrine touching the inabilitie of freewill, doth it lead a man to looſeneſſe? nay, rather doth it not teach him to deny himſelfe, and to ſeeke for all grace and goodneſſe from God? humilitie and prayer are the fruits of this doctrine, and not looſneſſe and libertie: and to make it cleare to any ſingle eye: We teach that a man is onely voyde of freewill to grace before his regeneration, and that hee is paſſiue onely in the very act of regeneration: but after his will being quickned, and ſtirred vp by Gods ſpirit, he willeth and worketh forth together with the ſpirit of God, his owne ſaluation. Now, few or none there are, that are Chriſtians, but preſume, though falſely, that they are regenerate: and therefore this doctrine cannot giue libertie to any to ſinne, but rather bindeth them faſt to obedience; nay, doth not their doctrine rather open a gappe to libertie? For when they teach, that it is in a mans power either to accept or reiect the grace of God offered vnto him: What doth this but incourage men to deferre their repentance & conuerſion, ſeeing it is in their power to accept it when they liſt?
               
                  94. Secondly, how can the doctrine of iuſtification by11. faith alone tend to looſeneſſe, ſeeing we teach, that faith is neuer ſeuered from good workes, nor iuſtification from ſanctification, nor a right beliefe from an vpright life, as hath beene ſhewed, and that they which ſeuer and part thoſe things which God hath coupled together, ſeuer themſelues from the mercie of God, and merit of Ieſus Chriſt? With what brow of braſſe then can they call this a ſolifidian portion, and a doctrine of libertie? I, but manie take libertie hereby to lead a looſe and wicked life, building vpon this ground, that they are iuſtified by faith alone, and ſo they neglect all good workes. True indeed, many ſuch there are: but is it from our doctrine? is it not rather from their miſtaking of it? So the Capernaites tooke offence at our Sauiour Chriſts heauenly doctrine, Ioh. 6. touching the ſpirituall eating of his fleſh, and drinking his bloud: inſomuch that many of them departed from him: was his doctrine therefore erronious? or were not they rather ignorant in miſconſtruing, & impious in peruerting the ſame? So is it with this myſterie of iuſtification, which is the verie doctrine of Ieſus Chriſt: if any by miſtaking it, or by taking vp one piece of it, and leauing another, doe animate themſelues vnto ſinne, is the doctrine to be blamed? and not they rather, that diſtort it to their owne ſhame and confuſion? In a word, if this were a iuſt exception againſt this doctrine, then no doctrine either of their or ours, or the Goſpell it ſelfe might bee freed from this challenge. For as there is no herbe ſo ſweet and wholſome, but the Spider may ſucke poyſon out of it, aſwell as the Bee hony: ſo there is no truth ſo ſacred and holy, but an vngodly minde may peruert and make it an occaſion of his impietie. Thus, the grace of God is turned into wantonneſſe by many (as Saint Iude ſaith:) theIud. 1. 4. 
                  word of God is the ſauour of death vnto death. Yea, Chriſt Ieſus our bleſſed Lord and Sauiour is a falling, and a ſtone to
                  1. Pet. 2. 8. 
                  ſtumble at, and a rocke of offence: ſo the doctrine of Iuſtification by faith alone, may be an occaſion of libertie and no otherwiſe: that is not properly, or by any effect iſſuing from itſelfe, but accidentally, and by the malignitie of the obiect whereupon it worketh.
               
                  95. Thirdly, our doctrine of perſeuerance, though rayling12. 
                  Wright ſayth of it, that Epicurus himſelfe could not haue found a better ground to plant his Epicuriſme: nor Heliogabalus haue better patronized his ſenſualitie: nor Bacchus and Venus haue forged better reaſons to inlarge their dominion: yet, to any ſingle eye (for his eyes are double-ſighted with malice, as Witches eyes are ſaid to be) it is rather a ſtrong bridle to reſtraine from ſenſuality and Epicuriſme, and a bond to bind to obedience, then a provocation vnto ſinne: for when men are perſwaded that ſincere faith, true charitie, and ſauing grace cannot be loſt, it will cauſe them to take heed how they fall away, leſt they proue themſelues to haue beene hypocrites before, and their faith and charitie not to haue beene true, but fained: for he that falleth from God whom he pretend: d to ſerue, to the Deuil by an actual Apoſtaſie into ſinne, plainly proueth that hee had neuer the ſeed of the ſpirit ſowne in him, nor the habit of charitie in his ſoule: this is then a bridle to withhold men from ſinne, and not a ſpurre to pricke them forward vnto it. And therefore whereas they ſay that men will thus reaſon: If I be the child o
                     •
                   God, I cannot fall away: therefore I will doe what I liſt. The contrarie is rather true, that euery child of GOD, yea, euery one that is perſwaded that hee is the childe of GOD, will reaſon thus from the grounds of this doctrine: I will not doe what I liſt, neither will I giue my ſelfe ouer vnto ſinne, leſt I proue my ſelfe by my falling into ſinne, not to be the child of God, but an hypocrite. Adde hereunto, that as we teach, that true faith and charitie cannot bee vtterly extinct in the elect: So alſo we teach, that this faith and charitie muſt bee nouriſhed and preſerued by the practice of all holy & Chriſtian duties: and therefore they which neglect the conſeruation of their faith, and charitie, and ſeek to extinguiſh them by the luſts of the fleſh, it is a ſigne that they neuer had theſe graces in grafted in their ſoules. And what perſwaſion can be more effectual, I pray you, to ſtirre vp men vnto godlineſſe, then this is?
               96. So we may truly anſwere concerning the fourth doctrine13. obiected, namely, the impoſſibilitie of keeping Gods

Commandements, which though it be true in ſome part, albeit, not as they ſlanderouſly impute vnto vs. For wee hold that the regenerate perſon is able in ſome meaſure to keepe Gods Commandements, though not to that perfection which the Law requireth, exacting of euery one of vs the loue of God with all our heart, ſoule and ſtrength; yet this openeth not, but rather ſtoppeth the gap vnto fleſhly libertie. For, is any man ſo madde as to ſay, I will giue ouer all care of keeping Gods Law, becauſe I am not able fully and exactly to performe it? rather euery one that hath but a reaſonable ſoule will thus determine, Becauſe I am not able to performe perfect obedience to God, therefore I will indeuour to doe what I can, that my imperfections and wants may bee made vp by the perfect obedience of my Sauiour. All men will account him a wilfull wicked wretch, who being greatly indebted, becauſe he is not able to diſcharge the whole ſumme, therfore will take no care to pay any part thereof, which he is able to doe, but lay all vpon his ſureties backe: ſo we condemne him for a deſperate and damnable perſon, that, becauſe he is not able to ſatisfie the whole debt of Gods Commandements, therefore will not indeuour to pay as much as he can: beſides, we teach withall, that though this perfection be not attained vnto in this life, yet there muſt be a continuall growth and increaſe in grace and goodneſſe in all that belong to God, that at length, after this life ended, they may doff off the olde man, with the inabilities and corruptions thereof, and attaine to the higheſt degree of perfection in the life to come: the fruit of this doctrine then, is not ſenſuall libertie, but Chriſtian humilitie, not a prouocation to ſinne, but an incentiue, and ſpurre vnto godlineſſe.
               97. Thus I haue propounded vnto the view of the Chriſtian Reader, a ſhort Epitome of the great volume of their ſlanders, darted forth by them, both againſt our perſons, our gouernment, and our Religion it ſelfe: all which indeed is but a taſte and ſay of that, which might be ſpoken in this ſubiect, and which requireth an entire worke for the diſcouering of ther malice in this kinde: and ſurely, I thinke that labour

might be well beſtowed in ſearching this ſtinking puddie to the bottome, and diſcouering their malice, ſo to the beholding of all, that men might ſee their poyſon, and beware of ſuch Serpents: and high time it is to lay hand to this plough; for a double danger ariſeth from this dealing of theirs. Firſt, it confirmeth their owne followers in their hatred againſt the truth, and the profeſſors thereof. For they are perſwaded, that whatſoeuer is written or ſpoken by a Prieſt or Ieſuite, is certainly true, it being allowed (as all their writings commonly are) by the authoritie of the Church, and the Cenſors and viſiters appointed for that purpoſe, and therefore account it a deadly ſinne once to call the credit thereof into queſtion. And ſecondly it inueigleth and ſeduceth many vnſettled Proteſtants: Whileſt reading ſuch lying Pamphlets, they are either not able to diſcerne their falſhood, or not carefull to examine the truth by contrarie euidences: to preuent both which dangers, it would be a worke much beneficiall to the Church of God, and profitable to the cauſe of Religion, if ſome zealous Proteſtant would vndertake this taske, in a ful iuſt volume to decipher their malice, and diſcouer their ſlanders to the ful: but I leaue that to the guidance of Gods wiſedom, & proceed in my purpoſed diſcourſe to the next point.
               98. Their laſt trick is forgerie, for when neither by treacherie, nor cruelty, nor periurie, nor lying, nor ſlādering, they can worke their wils, but that their Religion groweth euery day more odious then others, at laſt as the moſt deſperate practice of al

And this laſt wee haue rather cauſe to hope, then they the firſt: ſeeing it hath pleaſed God to reueale to the world the miſchieuous myſteries of their Indices expurgatory: which whoſoeuer ſhall but duly conſider, muſt needs iudge their cauſe to lye a bleeding, and ready

The common Lawes, and ciuill Courts puniſh forgerers with ſlitting their noſes, branding their foreheads, cutting off their eares, pillorie, impriſonment, and diuers other ſuch like fearefull cenſures: the Eccleſiaſticall Lawes are as ſeuere againſt ſuch perſons; and the very Heathen.

               100. Of which, that the Church of Rome is guiltie, is ſo manifeſt, that none, that hath either read their Bookes of Controuerſies with iudgement, or ſeene their three chiefe Iudices Expurgatorij, one of Rome, another of Spaine, the third of Antwerp, can make any queſtion. And if any deſire to be fully ſatisfied concerning their dealing in this kind, let them haue recourſe to Doctor Iames his learned and laborious diſcourſe, where he ſhal ſee this wound ſearched to tho quicke, and the corruption thereof diſcouered to the whole world, and ſo ſearched and diſcouered, that by all their wit and policy they ſhal neuer be able to hide the filthines thereof: notwithſtanding, that the Reader that hath not that booke, may haue a little taſte of their dealing, and aſſurance of the truth of this my propoſition: I will offer vnto his view a few inſtances of their forgerie, and thoſe ſo plaine and palpable, that by no colourable excuſe they can be auoyded.

Secondly, the Commentaries vpon Pauls Epiſtles aſcribed vnto Saint Ambroſe,
                  Bell. de Chriſto l. 1. c. 10. & de Cleric. lib. 1. cap. 15. are cenſured by Bellarmine, peremptorily to bee counterfeit. And yet, the ſame Bellarmine produceth them to proue traditions, Peters ſupremacie, Limbus Patrum: that one may be holpen by anothers merit, and that Antichriſt is a certaine man, and in a word, moſt queſtions controuerted. Thirdly, liber Hypognoſticon, Bellarmine concludes, that it is none of Saint Auguſtines, yet hee alleadgeth it as Saint Auguſtines,
                  Idem de miſſ. lib. 2. cap. 12. to proue Euangelicall Councels: ſo Liber ad Oroſium is confeſſed by Bellarmine, to bee none of Saint Auguſtines, and yet hee is alleadged by him in another place, to proue the Booke of Eccleſiaſticus authenticall. Laſtly, the Commentaries vpon the Epiſtles that goe vnder the name of Saint Ierome, are iudged by Bellarmine to bee none of his, and yet he produceth teſtimonies out of them, to proue the neceſſitie of traditions, Peter to be the rocke of the Church, and that children may without their parents conſents enter into a religious Order. And this is ordinarie, not onely in Bellarm but in all other of their writers, as you may ſee particularly and plainly diſcouered in Doctor Iames his Treatiſe, touching the corrupting of Scripture. Councels and Fathers, by the Prelates and pillars of the Church of Rome. By which wee may note: Firſt, their conſcience, in that they know them to be Baſtards, and yet obtrude them as true borne. Secondly, their fraud, in that when they make little for them, or it may be againſt them, then they brand them with counterfeit: but when they ſpeake on their behalfe, then they are as true as ſteele: and thus with a blunder of counterfeit Fathers, they dazle the eyes of the ignorant: but the wiſe will iudge diſcreetly, and learne to diſcerne the Lion by his paw.
               
                  102. Touching their corrupting of true Authors, I will vrge againſt them but foure examples as in the former: but thoſe moſt famous, and three of them corrupted by their moſt famous Ieſuite Bellarmine. The firſt is of Chryſoſtome, in his ſeuenteenth Homily vpon Geneſis, where he readeth, Shee
                  Bel. de verb. Dei, lib. 2. cap. 12. 
                  ſhall obſerue thy head, and thou ſhalt obſerue her heele: whereas, as Philip Montanus a learned and iudicious Diuine of their owne confeſſeth, in the originall tongue of Chryſoſtome it is read 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , he, and not 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   
                  ſhee, which is alſo agreeable to the Hebrew and Greeke fountaines of the Bible. O, but becauſe this reading in the tranſlated Copie maketh for the worſhip of the Virgin Mary, therefore in our Ieſuites diuinitie it muſt be preferred. The ſecond is out of Chryſoſtome too, in his Sermon of Inuentius and Maximus, whom Bellarmine, to proueBell. de Relig. Sanct. l. 2. c. 3. that the relickes of Saints ought to be worſhipped, bringeth in thus ſpeaking, tumulos Martyrum adoremus, let vs worſhip the ſepulchres of Martyrs: whereas indeede, the word in Chryſoſtome is adornemus: let vs adorne and garniſh their ſepulchres: as both the originall Greeke and the Latine tranſlations, that are of any ſtanding, doe read it. The third is of Cyril, who is not onely changed and altered, but plainly diſmembered by them: for whereas hee writeth thus excellently concerning the power of faith: This faith which is the gift
                  Cyril in Eſay lib. 1. cap. 1. 
                  and grace of God, is ſufficient to clenſe and purge, not onely them which find themſelues ſomewhat ill, but alſo thoſe which are verie
                  Index Hiſpan. Gaſpar Qui reg. pag. 62. 
                  dangerouſly diſeaſed, &c. The Spaniſh Index hath cenſured him, and commanded theſe words to bee blotted out, with this peremptorie charge, Extextu deleantur illa verba. The fourth and laſt is of Cyprian in his Booke, De bono patientiae,
                  Cyprian. de bono patientiae. Bell de Euchar. lib. 2. cap. 28. where, for gustatam Euchariſtiam, they read, to maintaine the idolatrous circumgeſtation of the Euchariſt, geſtatam: contrarie to their owne copies: as on the contrarie, in Leo ſer. 14. de paſſione, for geſtemus, Bellarmine readeth guſtemus: and thus they turne Cat in panne, as the Prouerbe ſaith, and with the Apothecaries art, put quid pro qu

                     .
               
               103. Thus they handle the Fathers, putting words into their mouths that they neuer ſpake nor meant, and that in no

few places of their, writings. And as for later Writers, their Iudices Expurgatorij are ſufficient teſtimonies of their purging, expunging, wiping out, and foyſting in what they liſt into their Bookes: it is a profeſt, allowed and maintained practice of theirs, which at the firſt was kept in darkneſſe, as a worke of darkneſſe by ſecret conueyance: but after that by Gods prouidence it came to light, is now publikely defended as a thing not onely lawfull and commendable in it ſelfe, but alſo profitable for the Church of God, ſo that there needs no further proofe of their forgerie and falſification in this kind, ſeeing we haue confitentes aduerſaries. Onely for a concluſion, let vs a little conſider the reaſons that are vſed by theſe good men, for the defence of this their dealing.
               104. One May an Engliſh Prieſt out of Gretzer, & Poſſeuine,
                  Grounds of the olde and new Religion. the author (as it is ſuppoſed) of the grounds of the old and new Religion, in the latter end of that Booke, taking vpon him to anſwere Maſter Craſhaw, that laid to their charge the ſame crime that I now doe, anſwereth three wayes. Firſt, that it is a practice both lawfull and commendable. Secondly, that if it be vnlawfull, we are more guiltie of it then they. And laſtly, though they meddle with new Writers, yet the Fathers workes are ſincere and free from all corruption.
               105. To whom I reply briefly thus, that as touching his laſt anſwere which concerneth the Fathers, it is manifeſtly falſe, as I haue alreadie diſcouered in foure particulars, and is by Doctor Iames in his Booke in many more, and I doubt not but ſhall be more fully ere long made knowne to the world: and therefore, though that there was no rule preſcribed by the Councell of Trent, for the purging of the Fathers; as of yonger Writers: Yet it followeth not but that they might doe it without rule, which alſo Gretzer the Ieſuite perceiuingGretzer de iure & more prohib. lib. 2. c. 9. & 10. pag. 321. 328. to be true, ſeeketh to mend the matter by a fine diſtinction, by which indeed he matres it vtterly, and that is that the Fathers workes, as they are Fathers, need no purging, but being conſidered as Sonnes, their words may bee corrected and cenſured by the Church; or not as Fathers, but as Fathers-in-law;
                  Non vt patres, ſed vt vitrici. for when they feed the Church with ſound and wholſome

doctrine, they are Fathers: if otherwiſe, Fathers-in-law: thus by this fine diſtinction he granteth, that when a Father ſpeaketh any thing which they account falſe doctrine, he may be corrected, or rather corrupted, for then they eſteeme him not a Father but a ſonne: nor a true Father, but a Father-in-law; ſo that it is apparently falſe, which our new Author affirmeth, that none of the Fathers are corrected by them.
               106. Secondly, touching his middle anſwere, that if it be a fault, we are more guiltie thereof then they. I anſwere, that that is as falſe as the former, for let it bee granted, that ſome Bookes are corrected by ſome Proteſtants; yet firſt, they are the deeds of priuate perſons, and not the acts of the Church, not at all approued, much leſſe authorized by the Church, as theirs are: nay, all of ſounder iudgement in our Church doe aſmuch condemne that practice in our owne, as in any elſe. Secondly, ſuch corruptions or corrections are not frequent with vs, but rare and ſeldome. I dare boldly ſay, for one place altered by vs in any Writer, there are twentie by them, as their owne expurging Iudices doe beare witneſſe: and for this, I challenge any Ieſuite, or Romiſh Prieſt whatſoeuer to the encounter. Thirdly, moſt of thoſe Bookes which they lay to our charge, to haue beene corrupted by vs, as Auguſtines Meditations, Granadoes Meditations, The conuerſion of a Sinner, The Chriſtian Directorie, Oſianders Enchiridion, with other more, are not corrected in the originall themſelues, but in their tranſlations into our Language, ſome things are left out, ſome added, ſome changed and altered, as the Tranſlators thought good; whereas they corrupt the verie Texts and originall Copies of moſt Writers without difference. Fourthly, we ſeldome alter or change any Booke in the tranſlation, but withall we eyther confeſſe in the beginning of the ſaid Bookes, or profeſſe in the publiſhing of the ſame, this correction or alteration: but they haue practiſed this in ſecret, by certaine Enquiſitors appointed to that purpoſe, the myſterie of which art was long hid from the World, and had ſtill lien in darkneſſe, had not the prouidence of God, for theIunius praefat. in▪ Indic. Belgia. good of the Church, firſt diſcouered the Belgicke Index by

mere accident to that godly and bright ſtarre of our Church, Iunius, who made it preſently knowne to the world: and at this day few there are that vnderſtand the myſteries of that art: ſo cloſely and cunningly doe they conuay their matters: as for the Books themſelues they do ſeldome or neuer acknowledge their correction in the forefront and beginning of them as wee doe, but by all meanes labour to hide and conceale the ſame. Laſtly, though ſome amongſt vs, haue more raſhly, then wiſely, falſified ſome Writers of leſſer note, in ſome few things: yet they haue not meddled with the Fathers nor Councels: neither haue they done it, to gaine any thing thereby in diſputation, but onely to keepe the common people from infection: whereas they ſpare none, neither Fathers nor Councels, nor moderne Writers: and that, not ſo much leſt the common ſort ſhould bee infected, as that the learned might be depriued of thoſe weapons wherewith they might fight againſt them, and wound their cauſe. Seeing the caſe now ſo ſtands, that hee which can muſter vp together the greateſt armie of Authours, to fight vnder his colours, is thought to haue the beſt cauſe: their dealing then with vs, is like that of the Philiſtims againſt the Iſraelites, who deſpoyled them of all weapons and inſtruments of warre, that they might dominiere ouer them with greater ſecuritie; but ours is not ſo towards them. And therefore, both in this, and all the former reſpects, it is a miſerable vntruth and a deſperate cuaſion, to ſay, that wee are more guiltie of this crime then they are.
               107. Laſtly, whereas in his firſt anſwere, hee pleadeth the lawfulneſſe of the fact, let vs heare his reaſons to moue thereunto, and in the interim remember, that in prouing it to bee lawfull, hee confeſſeth it to bee done. But why is it lawfull? Mary, firſt, becauſe the Church being ſupreme Iudge on earth, of all Controuerſies touching faith and Religion, hath authoritie to condemne Heretikes. And therefore alſo, the workes of Heretikes: and if this, then much more to correct and purge their Bookes, if by that meanes ſhee can make them profitable for her vſe, and beneficiall to her children.

To which I anſwere two things▪ Firſt, that it is not the Church that doth this, but the ſacred Inquiſitors, to wit, certaine Cardinals and Lawyers deputed to that office, who for the moſt part are ſo farre from being the Church, that they are often, no ſound members thereof: I
                     •
                   it be ſaid, that they haue their authoritie from the Pope, who is vertually the whole Church: why doe they then ſpeake ſo darkly, and ſay the Church hath this authoritie, when as, they might in plaine termes ſay that the Pope hath it; but that hereby they ſhould diſplay the feebleneſſe of their cauſe, and the fillineſſe of this reaſon? for thus it would ſtand: Why, is it lawful for Books to be purged? becauſe the Pope thinkes it lawful. And muſt not he needs think ſo▪ when the Authors croſſe his triple crowne, and ſpeake againſt his ſtate and dignitie? Adde hereunto, that it is a fallacie in reaſoning, when that is taken for granted, which is in queſtion. For we deny their Synagogue to be the true Church: and much more the Pope to bee the ſupreme Iudge: and therefore till thoſe things be proued, the reaſon is of no effect.
               108. Secondly, moſt of thoſe things which are purged by them, are ſo farre from being hereſies or errours, that they are, the moſt of them, ſound doctrines of faith, grounded vpon the authoritie of Gods ſacred truth: for they blot out many things, in both olde and new Authours, that they themſelues dare not accuſe to bee hereticall: as that place in Saint Cyril before mentioned touching the power of faith, which is no more in direct termes, then that which is ſaid in the Scripture, Act. 15. 15. that faith purifieth the heart: and that in the Baſil Index of Chryſoſtome, The Church is not built vpon a man,

                     t. 
                  but vpon faith: and thoſe propoſitions which are commanded by the Dutch Index, to be wiped out of the Table of Robert Stephens Bible: to wit, that ſinnes are remitted by beleeuing in Chriſt: that he which beleeueth in Chriſt, ſhall not die for euer; that faith purifieth the heart: that Chriſt is our righteouſnes: that no man is iuſt before God, and that repentance is the gift of God: with a number of like nature. Theſe they purge out of Stephens Index, which notwithſtanding are directly, and in

as many words recorded in the Booke of God: and ſo it may iuſtly be thought, that they are ſo farre from clenfing Bookes from the droſſe and dregs of errour, that they rather purge out the pure gold and cleare wine of truth, and leaue nothing but dregs and droſſe behind.
               109. His ſecond reaſon is, becauſe nothing is more dangerous to infect true Chriſtian hearts, then bad Bookes. Therefore it is not onely lawfull, but needfull and behoouefull to the Church of God, that ſuch Bookes ſhould bee purged, and burned too, if it bee ſo thought meete by the Church, to the end that the ſinceritie of one true faith and Religion might be preſerued. I anſwere, all this is true which he ſaith: but are they hereſies which they purge? no, they are ſound and orthodox opinions, for the moſt part, as hath beene proued in the anſwere to the former reaſon. And doe they it, to keepe Chriſtian men from infection? no, their chiefe end and drift is, to depriue their aduerſaries of all authorities that make againſt them, that ſo they might triumph in the antiquitie of their Religion, and noueltie of ours: which is one of their principall arguments which they vſe (though with euill ſucceſſe) for defence of their cauſe: dealing herein as Holofernes did with the Iſraelites, at the ſiege of Bethulia, breaking the Conduits, cutting the pipes, and ſlopping the paſſages, which might bring vs prouiſion of good and wholſome waters, out of the ciſternes of olde and new Writers; this is their purpoſe and no other, whatſoeuer they pretend: for if they meant any good to Gods people for preuenting of infection, they would haue purged their lying Legends of infinite fables, their Canon Law of horrible blaſphemies, and their Schoolemen of many ſtrange opinions. Yea, they would haue condemned the Bookes of Machiauel, and of that Cardinall that wrote in commendation of the vnnaturall ſinne of Sodomie, and a number ſuch like filthy and deuilliſh Writings, which are printed and reprinted among them without controulement. And againe, is it vnitie in the true faith and religion that they ſeeke? no, it is conſpiracie in falſhood, and conſent in errour: and not vnitie in the truth: till the Romiſh

Religion bee proued to bee the true Religion (which can neuer be) this reaſon is of no force, to iuſtifie their proceedings. Laſtly, is it Chriſtian policy? no, it is deuiliſh ſubtletie, and craftie forgerie: for the caſe ſo ſtands betwixt them and vs, as in a tryall of land betwixt partie and partie: wherein hee that bringeth beſt euidence and witneſſe, carrieth the cauſe: now, if one partie either ſuborne falſe witneſſes, or corrupt true, or forge euidences to his purpoſe, or falſifie thoſe that are extant, all men will count him as a forger, and his cauſe deſperate, and iudge him worthie the Pillorie: ſo betwixt vs the queſtion is, who hath the right faith, and the beſt title to the Church. Our euidences are firſt and principally Gods Word, then the writings and records of godly men in all ages: now then, they that ſhall purge, pare, raze, blurr, falſify or corrupt any of theſe, muſt needs bee thought to bee ſubtle and craftie companions, and not honeſt and plaindealing men. The caſe then thus ſtanding, this practice of theirs cannot be termed Chriſtian policy, but plaine ſubtlety, to giue it no worſe a name.
               110. His laſt reaſon is drawne from the practice of the Church of God in all ages, which hath alwaies forbidden the Bookes of Heretikes to be read, and condemned them to the fire: and to this purpoſe he produceth diuers fit and pertinent authorities: to which I anſwere, firſt, that he fighteth herein without an aduerſarie: for we confeſſe, that this was a neceſſarie and commendable practice, to prohibit, condemne, burne and aboliſh all ſuch Bookes as tend to the corrupting of the Chriſtian faith, and alſo to preuent them in the birth, that they may not come to light: but yet for all that, this alloweth not their purging and paring of Bookes: for they cannot giue vs one example in all antiquitie of this dealing, except it bee drawne from Heretikes, whoſe practice it hathBel. de verb. Dei, lib. 2. cap. 7. Idem de Pont. lib. 4. cap. 11. Sixtus Senenſ. biblioth lib. 4. 5. pag. 262. beene to depraue the Scriptures themſelues, and the Decrees of Councels, and the Bookes of ancient Fathers, as witneſſeth Bellarmine in many places of his workes, and Sixtus Senenſis, and almoſt all other of their ſide.
               III. Secondly, the Fathers condemned onely the Bookes

of Heretikes: but our holy Inquiſitors condemne not onely thoſe whom they call Heretikes, as Caluine, Luther, Beza, Melancthon; but mangle and purge the Fathers themſelues, and their owne deare children, whom they dare not condemne for Heretikes, as this Author himſelfe confeſleth; thoſe they chop and change, wri

               112. Thirdly, and laſtly, the Fathers, when they condemned any Heretike, or hereticall Booke, did it openly to the view of the World, and not ſecretly in a corner, not aſcribing vnto them other opinions then they held, eyther by adding vnto, or detracting from their writings: But our Romiſh correctors, like Owles, flye by moonſhine, and ſo cloſely c

                     •
                  ld▪ of all theſe their Iudices Expurgatorij afford plentifull examples: ſo that they can no wayes colour their forgerie and falſe dealing by the examples of the Fathers, or Primitiue Church. For this is a new tricke of legerdemaine of the Deuils owne inuention, found out in this latter age of the World, which hath beene verie fertile in ſtrange deuices.
               113. Now then to conclude, and to leaue this Prieſt with his vaine and idle reaſons, to be fuller confuted of him whom it more neerely concerneth, and whoſe credit is touched by him: Hence two neceſſarie concluſions doe ariſe: one, that they are guiltie of forgerie and corrupting of Authours, by their owne confeſſions: and ſecondly, that they adde hereunto impudencie and ſhameleſſeneſſe, which is alwayes the marke

of an Heretike, and that firſt, in defending their owne vniuſtFrons Haereticorum, non eſt frons. and falſe dealing by reaſons, as if their wits were able to maintaine that ſnow was blacke, and the Crow white: and ſecondly, in tranſlating the crime from themſelues vnto vs, without all ſhew of reaſon, not caring what they ſay, ſo they ſay ſomething, for the honour of their miſtreſſe, the whore of Babylon, and defence of her cauſe.
               114. Now then, ſeeing it is manifeſt that they labour toConcluſion. vphold their Religion, by theſe vniuſt, vngodly and deuilliſh practices, as treaſon, crueltie, periurie, lying, ſlandering and forging, this concluſion muſt needes bee of neceſſarie conſequence; that therefore their Religion is not the truth of God, nor their Church the true Church of God. It is the iudgement of their owne learned Ieſuites touching this laſt crime (thatPoſſeuine. wee may conuince them out of their owne mouthes) that forging of falſe Treatiſes, corrupting of true, changing of Scriptures, and altering of mens words contrarie to their meaning, be certaine notes of hereſie: what can the Church of Rome be then leſſe then hereticall, that not onely doth all this, but now at length profeſſeth and maintaineth the doing thereof as lawful and profitable?
            
            
               
                  MOTIVE XIII. That Religion, the doctrines whereof are more ſafe both in reſpect Gods glorie, mans ſaluation, and Chriſtian charitie, is to bee preferred before that which is not ſo ſafe, but dangerous: But the doctrine of the Proteſtants Religion is more ſafe in all thoſe reſpects, and of the Papiſts more dangerous: ergo, that is to be preferred before this, and conſequently this to bee reiected.
               THe firſt propoſition is ſo euident and cleare, that ourMaior. aduerſaries themſelues will not deny it, neither can it by any good reaſon bee excepted againſt: for as it is in bodily phyſicke, that medicine is alwayes preferred, which bringeth

with it leſſe danger to the life of the patient, and if it miſſe curing, cannot kill: ſo is it in the ſpirituall phyſicke of the ſoule, which is Religion: that doctrine deſerueth beſt acceptance, which is moſt ſafe, and leaſt dangerous for the ſoules health. And as deſperate medicines, if they bee applyed by a skilfull Phyſicion, argue a deſperate caſe in the patient, ſo deſperate doctrines proue a deſperate cauſe. Neyther will any wayfaring man, when two wayes are offered vnto him, the one whereof is full of manifold perils, and the end doubtfull, the other ſafe from dangers, and the end certainly good, not chooſe rather the ſafer and certainer way, and leaue the other: ſo men like Pilgrimes, trauelling towards the heauenly Canaan, the way of Poperie on the one ſide, and of Proteſtancie on the other being ſe
                     •
                   before them, if they bee well in their wits, will chooſe rather that way, which is both the ſafer in the paſſage, and the certainer in the end. There is no doubt then in this firſt propoſition, and therefore let vs leaue it thus naked without further proofe, and come to the ſecond, and examine whether our Religion, or the Romiſh is the ſafer, that all men may imbrace that which by euidence of demonſtration ſhall appeare to be ſo, and reſuſe the contrarie: and here notwithſtanding all the former pregnant arguments, whereby the falſitie of their Church and Religion is plainly diſcouered, wee put our ſelues againe vpon a lawfull tryall, and referre our cauſe to the iudgement, not of twelue men, but of the whole world; that if our euidence bee good, wee may obtaine the day, and the mouthes of our aduerſaries may be ſtopped: if not, we may yeeld as conquered, to bee led in triumph by them to Rome, yea to the Popes owne palace to kiſſe his feet, and receiue his marke on our foreheads.
               2. That the Religion of the Church of Rome is not ſo ſafeMinor. as ours, may appeare by comparing our principall doctrines together: and firſt to begin with the Sacrament. That the bodie of Chriſt is truely, really and effectually preſent in the Euchariſt, both they and we hold, grounding vpon that text of Scripture (this is my bodie:) but concerning the maner of this preſence, the Romaniſts hold, that it is by tranſub ſtantiation:

we by a ſpirituall preſence, which notwithſtanding is true and reall, both in relation to the outward ſignes, and to the faith of the Receiuer. Now, ſee the dangers that ariſe from their doctrine, which are not incident to ours.
               2. Firſt, if there be not a corporall preſence of Chriſt, and a reall Tranſubſtantiation, as they ſuppoſe; then this doctrine leadeth to horrible and groſſe Idolatrie: for they muſt needs worſhip a piece of bread, in ſtead of Chriſt. And this not onely, if their doctrine bee falſe, but being ſuppoſed to bee true, in caſe hee that conſecrateth, be not truly a Prieſt, or haue not an intention to conſecrate, as oftentimes it fallethGum

                     t. in Gen. cap. 27. out: for in both theſe caſes, by the grounds of their owne. Religion, there is no change of ſubſtances; and therefore, as much danger of Idolatrie, as eyther of a falſe Prieſt, or of a true Prieſts falſe intention. But in our doctrine there is no ſuch danger, and yet as true, reall and powerfull an exiſtence of Chriſts bodie in the Sacrament, as with them, if not more: ſeeing the more ſpirituall a thing is▪ the more powerfull it is, according to the rules of reaſon: for wee are not in danger to worſhip a creature in ſtead of the Creatour: but wee worſhip the Creatour himſelfe, euen Ieſus Chriſt our Redeemer, who is there preſent after a ſpirituall manner, and that as reuerently, deuoutly and ſincerely, as they doe a piece of bread.
               3. Secondly, by this doctrine our aduerſaries incline to fauour the Capernaites, who had a conceit of a corporall and fleſhly eating of Chriſts bodie▪ and giue iuſt cauſe to the Pagans
                  Theoph. in Ioh. 6 Aug. in Pſal. 58. Gratian de conſecrat. part. 3. diſt. 2. to ſlander Chriſtian Religion, to bee a bloudy and cruell Religion. Whereupon the Fathers, to croſſe the one, and ſtop the mouth of the other, taught, that Chriſts ſpeech in the ſixt of Iohn, was to be vnderſtood ſpiritually, and not carnally; and that it was a figure, and not a proper ſpeech. But our doctrine doth giue no ſuch occaſion, eyther to the Heretikes on the one ſide, or to the Pagans on the other, neyther hath it any conſanguinitie with the Capernaites; and yet wee retaine as certaine and powerfull a participation of our Sauiours bodie and bloud as they doe. I know, they thinke to eſcape from this rocke, by a diſtinction of viſible and inuiſible eating:

as if the Capernaites dreamed that Chriſt would haue his bodie to bee eaten viſibly, but they inuiſibly, that is (ſay they) ſpiritually: which indeed is no cuaſion, for an inuiſible eating is a true eating. As when a blind man eateth, or a ſeeing man in the darke, and cannot therefore be called a ſpirituall eating, but a corporall: neyther doth this free them from approching neere to the Capernaites, though they ſomewhat differ from them, nor from giuing iuſt cauſe of offence to the Heathen; from both which our doctrine giueth full and perfect ſecuritie.
               4. Thirdly, and laſtly, their doctrine of tranſubſtantiation doth not onely countenance, but confirme the ancient hereſies of the Marcionites, Ʋalentinians and Eutychians, that impugned the truth of Chriſts humane nature, for they taught that he had not a true, but a phantaſticall bodie; and what do our aduerſaries but approue the ſame indeede, though they ſeeme to deteſt it in word? when they teach that his bodie is preſent in the Sacrament, not by circumſcription, nor determination, but by a ſpirituall and diuine preſence, quomodo
                  Bell. de Euchariſt. lib. 3. cap. 4. 
                  Deus eſt in loco, as God is in a place, which is aſmuch as to ſay, that his bodie is not a true bodie, but a ſpirituall bodie, that is, indeed a phantaſticall bodie. Againe, the bread which they ſay is the bodie, is not bread in truth, but in ſhew, after it is conſecrated: for there is nothing of bread, but the mere accidents without a ſubſtance, according to their doctrine; and ſo it is in all reaſonable conſtruction no better then a phantaſticall thing, ſeeming to the outward ſenſe, to bee that which in truth it is not. Why may not thoſe Heretikes then reaſon from theſe doctrines thus? If Chriſts bodie be a ſpirituall bodie in the Euchariſt, and the bread be phantaſticall bread, then why might not his bodie be ſo alſo, when he was on the earth? But the former is true by your doctrine, O ye Romaniſts, therefore why may not the latter, which is our doctrine, be alſo true? But none of theſe Heretikes can haue any ſuch aduantage from our doctrine, which teacheth that Chriſt, in reſpect of his humane nature, is reſident in the heauens, circumſcribed by place, and that hee is preſent in the

Sacrament, by the efficacie of his inuiſible, and powerful grace, after a ſpirituall manner, as Saint Augustine ſpeaketh, and
                  Aug. tract. 50. in Ioh. in v. 8. c. 12. 
                  that both the bread remaineth bread after conſecration, and the bodie of Christ remaineth ſtill a naturall bodie, after the reſurrection, retaining ſtill the former circumſcription, as Theodoret
                  Theodoret Dialog. 2. 105. auoucheth: this taketh away all aduantage from Heretikes, which their doctrine doth manifeſtly giue vnto them. For theſe cauſes Petrus de Alliaco the Cardinall doth confeſſe, that from our doctrine no inconuenience doth ſeeme to enſue: if it
                  Pet de Alliaco 4 q. 6. act. 2 ſ. Occa. in centiloq. Theolog. 
                  could be accorded with the Churches determination. And Occham, that it is ſubiect to leſſe incommodities, and leſſe repugnant to holy Scripture. Thus wee ſee, that in this firſt doctrine touching the Euchariſt, there is more ſecuritie, and leſſe danger in our doctrine and Religion, then in theirs.
               5. I come to a ſecond point, which is, touching the merits of works: whereby the Romiſh Religion doth caſt men into three eminent dangers which by our doctrine they are free from. Firſt, of vaine glory: for when a man is perſwaded that there is a merit of condignitie, in the worke which hee hath wrought, how can he chooſe but reioyce therein, and conceiue a vaine-glorious opinion of his owne worthineſſe: as the proud Phariſe did, when he bragged that he had faſted and prayed, and payd his tithes? ſeeing it is impoſsible, but that the nature of man which is inclinable vnto vaine-glory, and ſelfe-loue: if it haue a conceit of any ſelfe-worthineſſe, ſhould bee puffed vp with a certaine inward ioy, and pride: and therefore Chryſoſtome taketh it for wholeſome counſel, to ſay, that wee bee vnprofitable ſeruants, leſt pride deſtroy our
                  Chryſ. in Luc. 17 
                  good workes.
               
               6. Secondly, of obſcuring and diminiſhing Gods glorie and Chriſts merits. For where merit is, there mercie is excluded: and where ſomething is aſcribed to man for the obtaining of ſaluation, there all is not aſcribed vnto Chriſt: and although they colour the blacke viſage of this doctrine, with a faire tincture, to wit, that all our merits are from Gods mercie and grace, and that our good workes are dyed in

Chriſts bloud, and thence receiue all their vertue, and rigor: yet it is but a falſe pretence: falſe, becauſe they acknowledge ſome merits before grace, as thoſe of congruitie, and ſuch as iſſue from grace, yet in part, to be of nature aſwel as of grace, as hath beene alreadie diſcouered: and a pretence, becauſe, if they receiue all their vertue from Gods grace and Chriſts bloud, then they are not to be termed our merits, but Gods: neither can bee ſaid to deſerue any thing at Gods hand of a proper worthineſſe, as they teach, they doe, but of Gods grace and mere mercie, which they diſclaime: a falſe pretence then is this, and doth not free them from this danger of diminiſhing Gods glorie: and this alſo is confeſſed by S. Auguſtine, who ſayth, that we liue more ſaſely, if we attribute
                  Aug. de bone perſeuerant. c. 6. 
                  all wholly to God, and dee not commit our ſelues partly to God, and partly to our ſelues: this the Romaniſts doe, they diuide ſtakes betwixt God and man, grace and nature, Chriſt and Adam.
               
               7. Thirdly, of making the beſt vncertaine of their ſaluation: for as they teach, no man can bee certaine of his owne righteouſneſſe, nor of the goodneſſe of his workes, by reaſon of the manifold defects that cleaue vnto their beſt deeds, and alſo in reſpect of the vnſcrutable deceit of mans owne heart, which is hidden not onely frō the eies of other men, but euen from a mans owne ſelfe, and is knowne onely vnto God, as the Prophet Ieremie telleth vs, and alſo in reſpect of the ſtrictIer. 17. 9. rule of Gods iuſtice, whereby they muſt bee examined. For which cauſe, the holy man Iob ſayth of himſelfe (accordingIob. 9. 2
                        •
                     
                   as it is in the vulgar Latine tranſlation) I was afraid of all my workes. And Saint Auguſtine ſayth, and affirmeth the ſame;Aug. de peccat. me
                        •
                      it. & remiſ. lib. 2. cap. 10. Greg. morall. lib. 9. cap. 1. 
                  That though Iob was a righteous man, yet he himſelfe was afraid of himſelfe. And Gregory ſpeaketh to like effect, when hee ſayth; That the holy man Iob, becauſe he ſaw all the merit of our vertue to be faultie, if it be ſtrictly iudged by him which iudgeth within, ſayth rightly, If I will contend with him, I ſhall not bee able to anſwere one for a thouſand. Now, that which befell righteous Iob, how can it but bee incident to all Gods children? So, that though they talke of meritorious workes in

generall, yet no man can be ſure that his workes in particular are ſuch: and therefore no man, be he neuer ſo iuſt, can be ſure of his ſaluation. I ſpeake not here of that certaintie which is by faith, which they deny, but that aſſurance which is by hope, which they confeſſe: for a man cannot poſſibly hope that he ſhall by ſaued by his workes; when as he cannot poſſibly know, whether his beſt workes are ſuch as deſerue the fauour or disfauour of God. And if it is the propertie of all Gods children by the example of Iob to be afraid of their workes, then how can they repoſe any hope and confidence in them? now all this is ſo euident, that Bellarmine himſelfe is
                     Bell. de Iuſtif. lib. 5. cap 7. driuen after his long diſputes, and much adoe in ſtrengthening their doctrine of inherent righteouſneſſe, and merit of workes, to confeſſe ingeniouſly, like a good honeſt man, (being as it were ſorrie for all that hee had ſaid) that becauſe of the vncertaintie of their owne righteouſneſſe, and the perill of vaine glorie, the ſafeſt way is, to repoſe our whole trust and confidence in the onely mercie and goodneſſe of God. But this wee teach men to doe, that flying from all vaine confidence in their owne merits, they may repoſe themſelues onely on the mercy of GOD in Chriſt Ieſus: and therefore ours is the ſafeſt way.
               8. And if ours be the moſt ſafe, then theirs is moſt dangerous, which alſo S. Bernard in as plaine termes affirmeth, whenBernard in Pſal. qui habitat. he ſayth: Periculoſa habitatio illorum, qui in meritis ſperant, perculoſa quia ruinoſa: dangerous is the dwelling of thoſe which truſt in their owne merit, it is dangerous, becauſe it is ruinous. Now, who that is wiſe, will not chuſe to walke in the ſafeſt way, and refuſe the dangerous? or to dwell in a ſtrong and ſafe houſe, which will keepe out the wind and weather; and not bee ouerblowne with any tempeſt, rather then in a ruinous cottage, which euery blaſt is able to ouerturne?
               9. The doctrine of Free will is of like nature: for is it not3. Concil. Trid. ſeſ. 6. cap. 3. Bell. de grat. & li. arb. 5. l. 5. c. 29 Coſter Enchirid. de lib. arbitr.
                   dangerous (thinke you) to aſcribe ſome power to mans own will for his conuerſion? as the Church of Rome doth, when it teacheth, that it is in mans free choice to accept, 
                        •
                     rr
                        •
                     iect Gods grace offered vnto him: and ſo eyther to be or not to be conuerted.
                  
And is it not a ſafer courſe to aſcribe all to grace; and nothing at all to will? and to ſay with our Sauiour Chriſt, that without him we can doe nothing: and with Saint Paul, That wee
                  Ioh. 15. 5. 
                  haue no ſufficiencie in our ſelues, to thinke a good thought, as of
                  2. Cor. 3. 5. Philip. 2. 13. 
                  our ſelues. And againe, That it is God which worketh in vs both the will and the deed of his good pleaſure. In the one, God hath all the glorie of the worke: in the other, man is equalled with God, will with grace, yea preferred before it, for they not onely teach, that grace and will are like two men carrying
                  Bel. de grat. & lib. arbi. li. 4. c. 15 
                  one ſtone, neyther of them adding any ſtrength vnto the other, and both free when they will, to caſt off the burthen: but alſo, that Gods grace and working dependeth vpon mans will, not mans will vpon Gods grace. For thus they are not aſhamed to ſay, euen the beſt and moſt iudicious amongſt them. Licet in codem
                  Bel. ibid. 
                  prorſus momento temporis, & naturae Deus & volunt as operari incipiant, tamen Deus operetur, quia voluntas operatur, non contra: .i. Though the God of nature, and▪ freewill, beginne to worke together, at the ſame inſtant: yet God worketh, becauſe the will worketh, not the will, becauſe God. Now, is not this not onely to equall, but alſo to ſubiect Gods grace to mans will, and to make the creature more powerfull then the Creator? For by this doctrine, if a man himſelfe bee willing, and giue admittance to grace, he may be ſaued; but if God bee neuer ſo willing to ſaue vs, if we our ſelues willnot entertaine his ſauing grace, all his labour is vaine: and ſo mans will muſt needs be of greater power and efficacie, then Gods grace: which how dangerous, yea impious a thing it is to affirme, let all men iudge. I am ſure Saint Auguſtine was of another mind, who ſayth not as the Romanists, that it is left to our freeAug. de corrept. & grat. cap. 11. Idem de grat. & lib. arbitr. ca. 17. choice, either to vſe, or to refuſe the grace of Chriſt, that ſtandeth at the doore of our heart, to bee let in or thruſt out as we liſt: but it is (ſayth he) by grace, not onely that we can doe what we will, but that we are willing to doe what wee can, and againe, He worketh in vs to will without our ſelues, but when we are willing, then he worketh together with vs.
               
               10. But yet, this is not all the danger which ariſeth from this doctrine, though euen this is of ſufficient feare; to terriſie

any godly man from imbracing it: but there is more perill in it then ſo: the maine danger of it is this, if it bee not pure Pelagianiſme, as it may well bee thought, yet it marcheth on the verie edge of the banke, ſo that if the foot doe but ſlip, it is preſently in the gulfe of that hereſie: for what did Pelagius hold, which the Church of Rome, in this doctrine of freewill, doth not eyther directly maintaine or approch nere vnto? he extolled mans nature, as that a man without the name of Chriſt might bee ſaued by freewill: ſo doe they: for Andradius telleth vs from the Councel of Trent, that Heathen Philoſophers hauing no knowledge of Chriſt, were
                  Aug. denatur. & grat. cap. 39. Idem Epiſt. 107. Idem cont. Pelag. & Celeſtin. cap. 32. Andrad orthod. expli lib. 3. pag. 277. 
                  iuſtified onely by the law of nature. Hee taught that it was in mans free-will, to giue entertainment or repulſe to Gods grace: ſo doe they. Hee affirmed that a man might prepare himſelfe to grace by his owne naturals, without any ſpeciall worke of the ſpirit: ſo do they. Hee, to cloake all with ſome colourable pretence, confeſſed, that notwithſtanding all this, there was a neceſſitie of grace required to all good actions. For thus he ſayd (as witneſſeth Saint Auguſtine) We ſo prayſe
                  Aug ibid. 
                  nature, that we alwayes adde the helpe of the grace of God: ſo doe they: albeit they ſtriue for the freedome of mans will: yet they dare not but ſpeake of grace, and grant vnto it ſome office in a mans conuerſion, and therefore labour to reconcile natures will, and Gods grace together: Which neuertheleſſe in fine they are neuer able to do, but are driuen to confeſſe, that it paſſeth the capacitie and apprehenſion of mans wit and vnderſtanding. Howbeit, both Pelagius and they vnderſtandBel. de lib. arbit. lib. 4. cap. 15. Benius cap. 20. pag. 353. Aug. Epiſt. 100. Bell. de. grat. & lib. arbi. l. 6. c. 15. by this grace, nothing but a thing that is common both to the wicked, and the godly. This to bee the grace which Pelagius required, Saint Auguſtine teſtifieth, and no other to be that which our Romaniſts ſpeake of, witneſſe Bellarmine, who affirmeth that the firſt grace of a ſinners conuerſion, is but onely a perſwading, which doth not determine the will, but inclineth it in manner of a propounding, obiect. And Coſter,
                  Coſter Enchrid. de lib. arbitr. 
                  that calleth it not grace dwelling in the ſoule, but only an outward impulſion, or motion knocking at the doore of the ſoule, and not opening the dore it ſelfe: as the Scripture ſayth, that God opened
                  Act. 16. 16.
                  
                  the heart of Lydia, but perſwading freewill to open: and ſo ſtanding at the Porters reuerſion, and like a poore man wayting his leaſure: much like vnto the attending of Henrie the Emperour at the citie gate, three colde winters dayes barefoote, and barelegged, till it pleaſed the Pope to let him in. Thus humble grace muſt attend, till pride will be pleaſed to open the dore vnto it. I will not ſay, that in all this Papiſme and Polagianiſme are all one, but (that they may ſee how loth we are to wrong them in the leaſt circumſtāce) this is too too apparent that they incline by this doctrine verie nigh to the borders of it, and almoſt touch the skirts. Who then will not thinke it a dangerous doctrine? And what madde man will voluntarily come to a perſon infected with the peſtilence, when hee may well paſſe by him in further diſtance? or walke in the verie brinke of a ſleepe banke, where if hee doe but tread awry he falleth into the Sea: whereas hee may walke ſafely further off, without any feare or danger? our doctrine therefore touching freewill aſcribing all vnto God, and nothing vnto man, and ſubmitting the will of man to the grace of God, hath no affinitie but oppoſition and contrarietie to Pelagius hereſie, is therefore the ſafer, and of euerie wiſeman to be imbraced, rather then theirs, which leadeth vs apparently into all theſe dangers.
               11. Their doctrine of ſatisfactions is alſo a moſt perplexed4. and dangerous doctrine, and giueth no ſecuritie to the conſcience of a penitent ſinner. For firſt, what ſafetie is there in a mans owne ſatisfactorie workes, when as all the actions and paſſions of a Chriſtian (bee hee as abſolute and perfect a man as poſſibly may be) by reaſon of the manifold defects and imperfections, which cleaue vnto his beſt workes, are far ſhort of that which they ſhould be, and vtterly vnproportionably to Gods iuſtice? and this they themſelues denie not: for the Rhemiſts grant, that euery man (bee hee neuer ſo iust) yet
                  Rhem. in Mat. 6. 1

                     . 
                  becauſe he liueth not without veniall ſinnes, may truly, and ought to ſay this Prayer, Forgiue vs our treſpaſſes. But veniall ſinnes are ſinnes, and ſtand in need of pardon; and Gods iuſtice requireth ſuch a ſatisfaction, as is in euerie reſpect perfect:

therefore our owne workes being tainted and ſtained with ſuch ſinnes, cannot ſtand in proportion with it. Is it not a dangerous thing then to truſt to our owne ſatisfactions: which by their owne confeſſion are ſubiect to veniall ſinnes? and is it not more ſafe to rely vpon his ſatisfactiō only which is free from all ſtaine of the leaſt ſinne, and able to anſwere the ſtriſt iuſtice of God in euery reſpect?
               12. Secondly, the ſatisfaction which Chriſt hath made, not onely admitteth no exception, but is of infinite merit and valew, to anſwere the infinite iuſtice of God: but the ſatisfactions of a mortall man admit many exceptions, and are, if they were perfect, of a finite and limitable nature: and therefore cannot bee proportioned to the infinite iuſtice of God: whether is it more ſafe then to truſt to an infinite ſatisfaction, that is, without all exception, or to a finite which may many wayes be iuſtly excepted againſt? I know, their cuaſion is, that indeed it doth require an infinite vertue, to ſatisfie for the euerlaſting puniſhment of ſinne: but the temporall puniſhment being limited, may bee ſatisfied for, by a temporall ſatisfaction: a mere colluſion: for firſt, if a temporall paine, or finite action, can merit and purchaſe an euerlaſting reward, as they teach, why ſhould not the ſame redeeme from an euerlaſting puniſhment? their confeſſion in the one condemneth their aſſertion in the other: and becauſe they deny that our merits of ſatisfaction can rel eaſe from hell, they muſt alſo of neceſſitie deny, or at leaſt bluſh to auouch, that our merits of purchaſe are of ſufficient valew to deſerue heauen: hell and heauen being as of equall diſtance from man, ſo of equal merit or demerit to man. Secondly, ſatisfaction is not to be reſpected, to the quantitie of the temporall puniſhment inflicted, but to the iuſtice of him that inflicteth it: and ſo though the temporal puniſhment be equalled by the penance of a ſinner: yet the iuſtice of God which is infinite, is not ſatisfied nor equalled, and therefore the greateſt penance cannot be termed a ſatisfaction to God: but Chriſts ſatisfaction being infinite, equalleth the iuſtice of God. Who would not then rather chooſe this, to rely vpon for his ſaluation, then

the other? Thomas Aquinas ſeeing this, aſcribeth an infinitieAquin. ſupplem. q. 13. art. 1.

               13. Thirdly, they themſelues cannot agree about their ſatisfactions, as whether they bee by precept and commandements:Vide D. Morton Proteſtant appeale l. 2. cap. 15. §. 7. and Doctor 
                        〈…〉

                   or only by counſell and perfection, and not commanded: whether the vertue of ſatisfying bee in the outward or inward act, or in both; whether they ſerue to take away the temporall puniſhment onely, or the gilt of the ſinnes, or the puniſhment of hell excepting the eternitie: whether they be ſo neceſſarie, that there can bee no abſolution without them, or that a ſinner may be abſolued by his contrition, and confeſſion, without penal ſatisfaction: and laſtly, whether the leaſt ſatisfaction be ſufficient for the greateſt temporall puniſhment; or that a due proportion is to be obſerued. All theſe intricate queſtions are exagitated in this doctrine: ſome holding one thing, ſome another, without any iuſt, and ſure reſolution: what a dangerous thing is it then to relye vpon theſe vncertainties, which they themſelues are not able to bring into grounded principles? how much ſafer is it to repoſe our ſelues wholly vpon that bleſſed ſatisfaction of our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, in which neyther Romaniſt nor Protestant could euer find any ambiguitie or doubt; but that it is of abſolute neceſſitie for mans ſaluation, of infinite efficacie to appeaſe the wrath of God, and of proportionable dignitie to the iuſtice of God?
               14. Laſtly, after they haue with one hand ſtretched the worthineſſe of their ſatisfactions to the higheſt ſtraine: yet they pull them downe againe with the other, and make them of no force: for let the ſatisfaction bee what it will, yet the Popes pardon can diſſolue the bonds thereof: for it is a ruled caſe in their Religion, that all ſatisfactorie puniſhment may bee

worſhipping certaine relickes, and kneeling to certaine pictures, &c. but alſo by disburſing certaine monie out of their purſes, that may come to the Popes purſe and coffers. Behold now the greateſt danger of this doctrine, thy ſatisfaction is releaſed and made no ſatisfaction, and it is releaſed by him of whom thou maiſt iuſtly doubt whether hee hathGerſon. 2. par. de Indulgent. authoritie ſo to doe, and whether he may erre in doing it: & hee doth it de facto, not examining whether thou bee truly penitent or no: but whether thou haſt payd thy penitentiall tax or no: and that which is worſt of all, hee ſo granteth it, that it is alwayes reuocable, at his ſecret pleaſure: ſo that ſatisfaction is made no ſatisfaction, by the Popes pardon: the Popes pardon is made no pardon, becauſe it is bought with monie; (thy monie periſh with thee, that thinkeſt this gift ofAct. 8. 20. the holy Ghoſt can bee obtained with monie:) and the mony is caſt away: becauſe the Pope may both erre in his pardoning, and alſo reuoke his pardon when he liſt, without giuing any notice of the cauſe vnto the partie: what ſecuritie can a Chriſtian conſcience find in theſe vnſure principles? How much ſafer a courſe is it to rely vpon Chriſts ſatisfaction onely, which is a true ſatisfaction indeed: not diſanulled by any act eyther of God or man: not pardoned but performed, not purchaſed by monie, but by faith which is more precious then

               15. Touching Antichriſt, whether ſide doth more incline5. to take part with his Apoſtacie, and is in moſt danger to bee inthralled to his dominion, let any indifferent man iudge: for wheras it is granted by all, both Romaniſts and Proteſtants, yea, and Fathers alſo, that Antichriſt ſhould bee a Monarch clayming an vniuerſall iuriſdiction throughout the whole World, and ſhould alſo challenge to himſelfe an infallibilitie of iudgement: Proteſtants abhorring all ſuch manner of ſubiection, and renouncing all ſuch power in any creature, cannot poſſibly fall into the Antichriſtian gulfe. But Papiſts

                        er de Pontif. Salmer. in Epiſt. Paul. diſp. 11. & 14. of faith, muſt needs bee in more danger to bee in Antichriſts Kingdome: we cannot be ſlaues to Antichriſt, becauſe we admit no gouernment like vnto his in the Church, nor any ſuch peremptorie power of not erring in the gouernment. But they profeſſing a gouernment and a power in that gouernment, ſo agreeable to the ſtate of Antichriſt, may ſuſpect themſelues to bee fallen into that Apoſtacie, as they are indeed ouer head and eares. Our religion then is more ſecure in this reſpect: whereas theirs, by their owne principles, hath ſome affinitie and correſpondence therewith: and Antichriſt himſelfe may be in their Church, but cannot by any probable coniecture be in ours.
               16 Againe, for the Article of Inuocation of Saints, the6. Romaniſts that hold the affirmatiue, are in many reſpects ſubiect to many more and greater dangers then the Proteſtants which hold the negatiue: for firſt, if their doctrine bee not true, they manifeſtly detract from the glorie of the Creatour, and giue the ſame vnto his creatures. Whereas if our doctrine bee falſe, wee onely detract from the glorie of the creatures, and giue it vnto the Creatour. Now, by how much it is a greater ſinne to doe iniurie to the Creatour, then to the creature, by ſo much the more dangerous is their doctrine, then ours: and as it is ſafer to aſcribe that glory to God, which is due to man, then to man that, that is due to God; ſo is there more ſafetie in our doctrine then in theirs.
               17. Secondly, in reſpect of charitie: if they erre in this opinion, then doe they turne the holy Saints of God into abominable Idols, and ſo offer that wrong vnto them, which, they being iealous of Gods glorie, of all things moſt deteſt: as the examples of Paul and Barnabas, and of Peter, and theAct 14. 15. Act 10. 26. Reuel. 19. 10. Angell declare: but if wee erre, wee onely being iealous that Gods glorie may not be communicated to any other, depriue them of a little worſhip, which wee thinke belongeth vnto God, and in the meane while eſteeme them as bleſſed Saints, and honour them by prayſing God for them, imitating their godly examples, and keeping an honourable remembrance

of them in our Churches. Now in charity, whether is a greater wrong to the Saints, to turne them into Idols, that is, into deuils, or for zeale of Gods glorie, to take from them a little of their due honour?
               18. Thirdly, in reſpect of conſcience: if they doe ſinne in this, it is the horrible and fearefull ſinne of Idolatrie, which being ſpirituall adulterie, cauſeth a diuorce betweene God and his Church: and is, if not in malignitie aboue hereſie, yet hereſie in the higheſt degree: for it robbeth God, not onely of his glorie, but of his eſſence, and lifteth vp another into his throne: but our ſinne, if it bee a ſinne, is at the higheſt, euen in the reputation of their ſlander, but hereſie, and that in the loweſt degree, conſiſting in matter of circumſtance touching the worſhip of the creature, and not in any fundamentall point of Religion, that concerneth the Deitie. Now, whether conſcience ſhould bee more afraid of this or of that, I thinke no man doubteth that hath a conſcience.
               19. Fourthly, we are ſure that we cannot inuocate any but the true God: for our Prayers are made vnto the bleſſed Trinitie, and to none other. But they are in danger to pray vnto falſe Saints in ſtead of true, yea, vnto thoſe that eyther neuer were in rerum natura, or that are in hell: for the being of many of their Saints, is grounded vpon their Legends and humane Stories:Sum.

Now many of their Saints may bee iuſtly doubted of, if not worthily reiected (Saint Augustines ſaying being notorious) that many that are tormented in hell with
                  Bell. de Sanct. beat. lib. 1. cap. 
                        •
                     
                   
                  the Deuill, are worſhipped by men in earth. Therefore their inuocation muſt needs be dangerous.
               
                  20. Laſtly, that God heareth our prayers, no man doubteth: but how the Saints heare them, whether by the declaration of Angels, or reuelation of God, or in the glaſſe of the Trinitie, they themſelues are not able to determine; what wiſe man now will relye his faith vpon ſuch vncertainties? and not chooſe rather to make his prayers to God, who, wee are aſſured, heareth them, and knoweth the heart, rather then to them of whoſe knowledge and preſence wee haue iuſt cauſe to doubt.
               21. The worſhip of Images and relickes doth plunge the practiſers thereof, into many apparent dangers, which the refuſers cannot fall into. As firſt in ſhew, at leaſt they cannot but be iudged breakers of the ſecond Commandement, which forbiddeth the worſhip of any Image, of whatſoeuer is in heauē, earth or Sea, that is, in the whole world: but they worſhip many and diuers Images, of all ſorts: therefore in ſhew muſt needs be tranſgreſſors of the ſecond Commandement. Neyther can they rid thēſelues frō this crime, but by new deuiſed diſtinctions of latria and dulia, I doll and Image, the one being of Heathen gods, the other of Chriſtian Saints. And in a word, ſome of them are driuen to ſay, that this Commandement was no part of the morall Law, but a mere ceremoniall
                  Vaſques de aderat. lib. 2. diſp. 4. cap. 4. 
                  precept, pertaining onely to the Iewiſh Church, as hath beene ſhewne before: vpon what quicklands, and ſhelfes are they driuen, that cannot cleare themſelues from Idolatrie, but by ſuch deſperate diſtinctions, which haue no foundation in the word of God? the Commandement prohibiteth all worſhip of any Image, yea, of the Creator himſelfe, and all his creatures: they come with their niceties of diſtinctions, and would make vs beleeue, that not all worſhip, but that onely which is called latria, is forbidden: nor all Images, but the Idols of the Heathen; that is, of ſuch things as neuer were: nor to all people, but the Iewes onely. I am ſure, we in ſhew▪ at leaſt, and (in verie deed,) in truth, doe giue more reuerence to this Commandement: for plainly and directly, without diſtinguiſhing, diminiſhing, altering, or any wayes wringing the precept, wee condemne all worſhip of all Images, in all

people whatſoeuer, as impious and Idolatrous: ſo that wee are in no dapger of tranſgreſſing this Commandement, as they are, if their diſtinctions helpe them not out.
               22. This danger is in reſpect of God, another followeth in reſpect of conſcience. The Paynims worſhipped ſtockes & ſtones, that is, dead and liueleſſe things, as both the Prophet Eſay, and the Prophet Dauid doe plainly auouch. Now, doeEſay 44. Pſal. 115. not the Romaniſts the like? for let it bee granted, that their Images and thoſe of the Heathen differ eſſentially, and that in truth: our Romaniſts worſhippe not ſimply ſtockes and ſtones, but the things repreſented by them; yet this cannot bee denyed, but that in outward appearance, their worſhippe hath great reſemblance to that of the Heathen. For when they fall downe before the croſſe, and ſay, All haile, O Croſſe, our onely hope, &c. as it is in their Maſſe Booke, and, Thou onely art worthy to beare the ranſome of the World: what doe they, but at leaſt in ſhew worſhip a ſtocke and a liueleſſe thing as the Paynims did? and when they ſay, they worſhippe not the thing it ſelfe, but the thing repreſented by the Image, (as in the Croſſe, Chriſt that was crucified on the Croſſe,) what do they but excuſe themſelues by the ſame reaſon which the Panims did? for Seneca ſayth, that by Iupiter ſtanding in the Capitoll,
                  Senec. queſt. natur. l. 2. c. 45. 
                  with lightning in his hand, they vnderſtood the preſeruer and gouernour of all things: and Pereſius a learned Papiſt affirmeth, that few or none among the Gentiles thought their Idols
                  Pereſ

                     rad. part. 3. pag. 45. 
                  to be Gods: yea, Saint Paul himſelfe telleth vs, that the Altar at Athens was dedicated to the ſame God that Paul preached,
                  Acts 17. 23. 
                  though vnknowne vnto them. So that in the matter itſelfe, and in the manner of excuſe, they are (without all doubt) couſen-Germanes to the Paynims: and if they bee not in the gulfe of their Idolatrie, yet they confine verie neere vpon the Coaſts thereof: whereas wee more wiſely march aloofe, and are afraid to approch any whit neere vnto them. This I ſpeake by way of ſuppoſition, if their Image-worſhip bee not the ſame with the Paynims: but if it be, (as it is indeed, as hath beene proued before) then with the heedleſſefiſh, they are leaped out of the frying pan into the fire: they are not any longer in

the danger, but in the miſchiefe it ſelfe: let them chooſe which of theſe they will, one they muſt needs fall into.
               23. Thirdly, if wee reſpect charitie, this doctrine is in danger to breake the cords thereof, by giuing a double offence, one to their owne ſilly ignorant ſeduced people: for they not being able to diſtinguiſh of their ſchoole diſtinctions, latria and dulia, proper and improper worſhip, nor to put a difference betwixt the Image and the ſamplar, which it repreſenteth, and being warranted to fall downe before the Image, doe ordinarily fall into Idolatrous worſhip: which is ſo common and notorious a thing among the ruder ſort, that Polidore Virgil, Caſſander, and Agrippa, all profeſt patrones of
                  Poly l. Virg. Inuent. li. 6. ca. 13. Caſſand. conſult. art. 21. Agrip. de vanit. cap. 57. 
                  Popiſh ſuperſtition doe ſay, that it is an ordinarie matter, A wonderful ſuperſtitiō that is nouriſhed by Images, & ſo apparent, that it cannot be denied. Now if this were a ſcandall taken, and not giuen, they might in ſome ſort bee excuſed: but it is eūidently, not onely occaſioned, but cauſed, by reaſon that both the doctrine is inuolued with ſo many intricate queſtions and diſtinctions, that it is impoſſible for an ignorant perſon to diſcerne thereof, and alſo becauſe the Image it ſelfe (as the Prophet Habacuck telleth vs) is a teacher of lyes. For which cauſe, as Polidore Ʋirgil reporteth, the Fathers, of all vices,
                  Polyd. Virg. quo ſupra. 
                  condemned the worſhip of Images, for feare of Idolatrie; the most execrable vice of all. The ſecond offence is to the vnconuerted Iewes, who are moſt zealous in this point of the Law againſt Images, inſomuch (as Ioſephus reports of them) theyIoſeph. Antiquit. lib. 15. cap. 11. did hate the verie Images of men in their Heatheniſh Trophees, as being forbidden them by God. Now it is well concluded by a iudicious obſeruer of the Weſterne Religions, (andS. EDW. S. without doubt is a moſt true obſeruation;) that there is no one thing, in outward reſpects, that doth ingender in the Iewes ſuch a deteſtation of Chriſtian Religion, and keepe them from being conuerted, as the worſhip of Images in the Church of Rome; for they, and that by good reaſon, may thus diſpute, If this Religion of Chriſtians were of God, then they would not oppoſe themſelues to the expreſſe Commaundement of God in worſhipping Images, which he hath ſo plainly

forbidden: but they oppoſe themſelues to Gods Commandement, and worſhip Images; therefore their Religion cannot bee of God. Hence it is, as the former learned Relator doth report, that at Rome, though all the Iewes in the Citie are conſtrained once a yeere to come to a Chriſtian Church▪ and there heare a Sermon, for their pretended conuerſion: yet when as a Fryer, before the beginning of his Sermon, holdeth vp a Crucifix, and prayeth vnto it, in their open ſight, they are more alienated from the Chriſtian faith by this odious ſpectacle, then all the reaſons and arguments that he can vſe, are able to perſwade them to the ſame. Behold two dangerous and fearefull ſcandals which ariſe from this doctrine: one, to their owne weake ones, of which our Sauiour ſaith, that it were better for a man, that a milſtone were hanged about his necke, and that hee were throwne into the Sea, then that hee ſhould offend one of them: the other, to the obſtinate Iewes, whoſe conuerſion ſhall be ſo beneficiall to the whole world, as that Saint Paul calleth it life from the dead. Now our ReligionRom. 11. 15. is farre from giuing any ſuch offence to one or other, either in this, or any other point thereof, if it bee not vtterly miſconſtrued and miſconceiued.
               24. Againe, in their worſhip of Relickes, there is no ſecuritie8. at all, both in feare of Idolatrie, which may bee well committed to them, if they bee true, in giuing them a higher meaſure of adoration then they themſelues allow of, which is eaſio to bee done by the ignorant multitude: and alſo in feare of worſhipping falſe relickes, in ſtead of true, whereof there is no ſmall number in the Church of Rome, as hath bin alreadie declared: and laſty, in feare of neglecting the true members of Chriſt, by a too ſumptuous prodigalitie towards the bones of (I cannot tel what) dead men, or other creatures, as is moſt vſuall in their Church, and that in great exceſſe: in which reſpects, it is without queſtion a more ſafe courſe, that all ſuch Relickes were buried vnder the earth, with due honour of Chriſtian ſepulture, then that they ſhould thus indanger both godly pietie & Chriſtian charitie. And this is the concluſion of their Caſſander, who ſayth, that it is more ſafe,
                  
                  rather honourably to burie thoſe corruptible relickes, and to draw the World to the worſhip of their ſpirituall relickes, which neither time can corrupt, nor fraud counterfeit.
               
               25. Againe they hold and teach, that traditions are to bee9. Concil. Trid. Seſſ. 4. decret. do. Can. Canus loc. l. 3. c. 3 honoured, with equall affection and deuotion, as is due vnto the olde and new Teſtament: and that there are many things belonging to the doctrine and faith of Chriſtianitie, which are neyther expreſſely nor obſcurely contained in the Scriptures. And therefore, by their owne confeſſion, they build many doctrines of their Religion vpon tradition onely, without Scripture, and acknowledge, that without tradition many of them would reele and totter. The Proteſtants hold the contrarie, and conſtantly affirme, that the Scripture is an all-ſufficient directorie, and a moſt abſolute and perfect rule for faith and manners: and therefore that wee ought not to relye our faith vpon any thing, but Scripture alone. Now let vs conſider, and examine whether of theſe two doctrines are more ſafe for a man to repoſe his ſoule vpon. And that our doctrine is ſo, may appeare firſt by the nature of the queſtion it ſelfe, which is controuerted betwixt them and vs: for the queſtion is not, whether the Scripture bee the Word of God, or no: therein wee ſhake hands, as an vndoubted truth: but whether traditions bee the Word of God or no: the affirmatiue they hold, wee the negatiue, and that by great and ſtrong grounds, which our aduerſaries themſelues cannot deny, but that they carrie great ſhew of reaſon and probabilitie. Now whether is the ſafer courſe, to relye our faith vpon thoſe principles that are vnqueſtionably Gods Word: or vpon thoſe that are controuerted, diſputed, and called in queſtion? Any man that goeth about to buy a purchaſe, will ſooner venture vpon ſuch a title which was neuer called in queſtion, nor can indeed bee doubted of, then vpon a broken, diſputable, and vndecided title: he will looke twice vpon his pennie, before he part with it, in ſuch a caſe, leſt caueat emptor proue him to bee of little diſcretion, and teach him to repent when it is too late. This is the caſe of euerie Chriſtian; wee are to buy the truth, and
                  Pro. 23. 23. 
                  not to ſell it, as Salomon counſelleth. Now who will not, that
                  
                  hath any graine of wiſedome in his heart, rather lay out his monie, that is, his ſoule and conſcience (which as Auguſtine calleth it, is numiſma Dei, Godscoyne, becauſe his Image is imprintedAug. in Pſal. 65. therein) for the purchaſe of that truth, which is without all exception in the holy Scriptures, then for that which is ſaid to be in traditions, but mixed with many doubts and ambiguities? It is a rule in Law, that abundans cautela non nocet: a man cannot be too warie in making ſure his title to any thing whatſoeuer. How much more then ſhould it preuaile in caſes of conſcience, where the damage is not of houſe and land, but of our ſoules, which to euery man ought to be more precious then the whole world? Here is an euident direction for our choice, if we eyther loue the truth, or our own ſoules which muſt liue by it.
               26. Secondly, it may appeare by the perpetuall certaintie of the holy Scripture, and variable vncertaintie of vnwritten traditions: for the Scripture was euer the ſame ſince it was Scripture, and ſo ſhall continue to the end of the World, no man daring to alter or change it, to adde thereto or detract ought therfrom, for feare of the curſe denounced againſt ſuch preſumption. But Traditions are, and haue beene euer moſt variable and vnconſtant: ſome that haue beene held for Apoſtolical traditions, being vtterly abrogated and aboliſhed: as threefold immerſion, or thrice dipping in baptiſme for ſignificationCanus loc. l. 3. c. 5 Maldon. in Ioh. 6 Durant. de ritib. lib. 3. cap. 24. of the Trinitie: giuing the Eucharist to infants, which was vſed 600. yeeres in the Church: ſtanding in publike Prayers at Eaſter and Pentecoſt, and ſuch like: and ſome altered and changed, as deferring Baptiſme vntill the feasts of
                  Idem l. 1. c. 19. 
                  Eaſter and Pentecoſt, into baptizing vpon any occaſion; faſting vpon Wedneſdayes and Saturdayes, into Wedneſdayes and Fridayes;
                  Binius tom. 1. Concil. fol. 247. Benius Schol. in lib. 7. conſtit. Clem. cap. 24. and ſo many ancient conſtitutions diſpenſed withall by the pretended Apoſtolicall authoritie of the Church of Rome, as is confeſſed by them. And that this is an vncontroulable truth, that one famous example of the contention betwixt the Eaſt and Weſt Churches, touching the obſeruation of Eaſter, doth euince: for the one ſide pretended a tradition from Saint Iohn and Saint Philip: the other from Saint Peter and

Saint Paul. Now if ſome traditions bee thus vncertaine, ſubiect to change, abrogating, diſpenſing, and aboliſhing, all muſt needs bee of the ſame nature: and if all bee of that nature, then there can be no ſecuritie in conſcience, to ſuſpend our faith vpon them: the ſafeſt way therefore is, to relye vpon Scripture alone; the fulneſſe whereof Tertullian adored, and ofTertul. contra Hermog. cap. 22. Hierom com. in tit. cap. 1. Aug. cont. liter. Petil. l. 3. c. 6. the authoritie whereof whatſoeuer was deſtitute, Ierome iudged to bee nothing but vaine babbling: and beſides the which, whoſoeuer teacheth any doctrine of faith, Saint Auguſtine pronounceth anathema againſt him.
               
               27. Thirdly, and laſtly, by the infallible truth which ſhineth in the Scriptures, as the Sunne in the firmament, wherein no errour euer was found, no ſpots or blemiſhes, as in the Moone of traditions: no deceit, nor miſleading, vnleſſe in ſence peruerted, as by Heretikes to their owne deſtruction: but many traditions haue beene as erronious and deceitfull in themſelues, ſo the cauſes of much errour in the Church: witneſſe Papius, who (as Euſebius teſtifieth) broched many exorbitantEuſeb. li. 3. c. 33. doctrines, vnder pretence of tradition from the Apoſtles, and drew manie Eccleſiaſticall Doctours moued by his antiquitie (for he was Diſciple to Iohn) into the errour of the Chiliaſts; and all the ancient Heretikes almoſt: who flying from the Scriptures, did ſhelter themſelues vnder the pretextWeſton de triplic. hō. offic. l. 3. c. 22. eyther of philoſophicall principles, fained goſpels, or forged traditions: and hereof, many ancient traditions themſelues giue pregnant euidence, as thoſe alleadged by Clemens Alexandrinus,
                  Clem. Strom. to wit, Iuſtification by philoſophie, Repentance after death, Preaching the Goſpell to the wicked in hell; which the Romaniſts themſelues condemne: or that of Cyprian, touching anointing to bee vſed in Baptiſme, and mixing wine with water, which Saint Auguſtine relected as erronious: or that ofAug. cont. Creſconium. Iraeneus contra haereſes. 
                  Iraeneus, who ſaith, that it was a tradition, that Chriſt ſuffered at fiftie yeeres of age; which is diſallowed by all ſound authoritie, and conuinced of errour by the Scripture it ſelfe. Of this kind a number more might bee produced, if need required: but theſe are enough to inferre the concluſion, that traditions are not of that infallible truth as the holy Scripture is,

but rather ſubiect to errour and falſhood: and therefore it can bee no part of Chriſtian wiſedome, to repoſe our faith vpon them; for it is to build vpon a ſandie foundation, which will deceiue the building, in time of need.
               28. Auricular confeſſion hath as little ſecuritie in the practice10. of it, as any of the former doctrines: for firſt it implieth inpoſſibilitie of performance, by requiring a perfect enumeration of all particular ſinnes, both ſecret, and open, and that vpon danger of damnation, the abſolution being fruſtrate, if this condition bee not obſerued. Now, becauſe no man is able to performe this, therefore no mans conſcience can be aſſured of the remiſſion of his ſinnes by that ſacramentall medicine: whereas on the contrarie, hee that confeſſeth his knowne ſinnes to God, and forſaketh them with a generall deteſtation of all other vnknowne, though many eſcape hisProu. 28. 13. remembrance, yet by Gods promiſe is ſure to find mercie: which is the doctrine of the Proteſtants. This is poſſible and eaſie to be done. The other impoſſible, and improbable: and that many learned of their ſide haue ingeniouſly confeſſed, as Caſſander, Rhenanus, with diuers others. And albeitCaſſand. conſult. art. 11. pag. 82. Rhenan. argum. in Tertul. de poenit. Concil. Trid. ſeſſ. 14. cap. 5. Suar. tom. 4. diſp. 22. the Fathers of the Trent Councell in ſhew ſeemed to qualifie the matter with this limitation, that other ſinnes which do not come into the mind of the partie confeſſing, diligently thinking vpon them, are vnderſtood as generally included in his confeſſion: yet the Ieſuite Suarez confeſſeth, that the Prieſt cannot remit any one ſinne, except the penitent confeſſe all that hee ought to confeſſe: and Maldonate another Ieſuite, that becauſeMaldon. Sum. q. 10. art. 8. 3. the Prieſt can remit no ſinnes but ſuch as he heareth confeſſed, therefore hee that must remit all, must heare all. And it is plaine, that whatſoeuer the Councell ſpake, yet it meant no otherwiſe, by the reaſon which they giue for neceſſitie of confeſſion: which is, that the penitent may bee iudged whether he hath ſinned or no: and if hee haue, in what kind, and degree, to the end that proportionable penance may be ioyned to his offence: and therefore it is required, that not onely the act of ſinne, but all the circumſtances bee diſcouered. (Who,
                  
                     Suar. tom. 4. diſput. 22. §. 1. 
                  what, to what end, how, by what helpes, where, when) which are

the ſeuen circūſtances attending vpon euery actiō. Now how can the Prieſt iudge of the nature, qualitie, & quantitie of the ſin, except he know it with all the circumſtances? & if he know it not, how can he enioyne a competent ſatisfaction? And if no ſatisfaction be enioyned, then no remiſſion eyther of the ſinne, or at leaſt releaſement from the temporall puniſhment thereof can bee obtained. What a ſnare are mens conſciences brought into by this intricate doctrine? How much freer and ſecurer a courſe is it to confeſſe neceſſarily to God alone, voluntarily to the Paſtor, in caſes of diſtreſſe of conſcience, and want of inſtruction, and penally to the Church in publike, for ſatisfaction not of God, but of men, for ſome publike offence committed? This is the doctrine of Proteſtants; which as it is free from impoſſibilitie, ſo it is full of ſafetie.
               29. Secondly, their doctrine leaueth the conſcience in doubt, whether the ſinne bee truly pardoned or no, by the abſolution of the Prieſt: for the Prieſt being a man, is vnable to ſearch into the heart of a ſinner: and ſo conſequently may erre in the vſe of the key: for if the Confeſſor bee an Hypocrite, though he make a true relation of all his ſinnes with all their circumſtances, and be therefore abſolued by the Prieſt: yet it is certaine, that ſuch an one is not abſolued in Heauen, but ſtands lyable to Gods iudgement: becauſe there muſt be by their doctrine, aſwell contrition in heart, as confeſſion in the mouth, or elſe no pardon can follow: but a Prieſt cannot

                        •
                     . diſcerne of the heart. Nay further, many, if not moſt of their Romiſh ſhauelings, are vnable to iudge of the nature and qualitie of ſin, much more of the quantitie and degrees thereof; & ſo conſequently can neither impoſe a iuſt or proportionable ſatisfaction, without which no releaſement; nor make the partie vnderſtand the eaſe hee ſtandeth in: that hee may take vpon himſelfe voluntarie penance: or if need bee, purchaſe indulgence from the Pope. In all which reſpects, it is danger to truſt our ſoules vpon ſuch a ſlipperie foundation: but hee that confeſſeth to God his ſinnes, and expecteth pardon at his hand onely, is ſure that hee diſcerneth the ſecrets of the heart, and that he ſhutteth, and no man openeth, and openeth, and
                  Reuel. 3. 7.
                  
                  no man ſhutteth: and therefore if hee abſolue, though all the World condemne, hee is on a ſure ground: and if hee condemne, though all the World acquite, hee is in a miſerable caſe. In this doctrine there is no vncertainty, but ſtrong comfort to the penitent ſinner, and terrour of conſcience to the obſtinate and vnrepentant.
               30. If they ſay, that the abſolution of a Prieſt is certaine, vnleſſe there bee a barre in him that confeſſeth, becauſe our Sauiour ſaith, Whoſoeuers ſinnes you remit, they are remitted, and whoſoeuers ſinnes yee retaine, they are retained. I anſwer, that firſt, de facto, the Prieſt may erre, but God cannot: Secondly, he cannot chooſe but erre in abſoluing, if the penitent doe erre in confeſſing, which hee is verie likely to doe: and thirdly, that when God purpoſeth to abſolute a ſinner, no barie can hinder the performance thereof: yea, hee infuſeth grace into his ſoule, to hate his ſinne, and power to forſake it. Is it not better then to truſt vnto God then to man, and ſafer to confeſſe our ſinnes to him that hath abſolute power to pardon them, then to a Prieſt whoſe pardon depends vpon the vncertaintie of a mans true confeſſion? Theſe things be ſo cleare, that no reaſonable man can doubt of the truth of them.
               31. Laſtly, confeſſion to God hath manifeſt and vndeniable grounds in holy Scripture; but auricular Romiſh confeſſion to a Prieſt, is by the iudgement of their greateſt Clarkes, taken vp onely by a tradition of the Church, and not by any authoritie of the olde and new Teſtament: witneſſe their Canon Law, Panormitane, Pereſius, Petrus Oxonienſis, Bonauenture,
                  Canon de poenit. Panormit. ſup. 5. de poenit. Pereſ. de traa

                  Medina, Rhenanus, Eraſmus with many more: and though the new Ieſuites, and Rhemiſts auouch the contrarie, yet they but therein croſſe their fellowes, as learned and wiſe, as themſelues, and yet are not able to alleadge any one direct proofe of their opinion. Now is it not a ſafer practice to build vpon Scripture then tradition, that is, vpon God then man? And to chuſe that kind of confeſſion which no man doubteth to be warranted from God, rather then that, which the Patrones thereof themſelues are at variance from whom it commeth?

who that hath eyes, ſeeth not which of theſe is rather to be choſen?
               32. Touching Purgatorie, it breedeth diuers dangerous11. conſequences, as to their holy Pope firſt, who taketh vpon him to haue plenarie power ouer all creatures, eſpecially ouer the ſoules in Purgatorie, which the Canoniſts call peculium Papae, the Popes peculiar: for it proueth him eyther to bee a lying Prophet, or a cruell Tyrant: if hee haue full power ouer them, why doth hee let ſo many thouſand poore ſoules lye frying there without releaſe? His ſuffering them to continue in that cruell torment, argueth him either to want power to relieue them, or mercie to put that power in execution: both which are vnbeſeeming qualities for Chriſts Vicar. If they reply againſt this (as Antoninus doth) and ſay, that in reſpectAnton. part. 3. tit. 22. cap. 5. §. 6. & 7. 
                  of his abſolute Iuriſdiction, he may abſolue all that are in Purgatorie: but if we regard the orderly execution thereof, in that reſpect the Pope may not, nor ought ſo to doe: I ſay againe, But why ought hee not? if it bee in his power? is it for feare to fill Heauen too ſoone with Saints? but that would be a great bleſſing, for then the conſummation of all things would the ſooner come: or is it for feare leſt the iuſtice of God ſhould be fully ſatisfied by a proportionable puniſhment? But the Popes indulgence can helpe that, for hee hath in his Treaſurehouſe ſuch a ſurpluſſage of Saints merits, that can ſerue to make good whatſoeuer is wanting in their behalfe: and the Pope by their doctrine hath authoritie to diſpence & diſpoſe of theſe merits, at his diſcretion. Or is it for feare leſt purgatorie ſhould bee emptied, and ſo hee ſhould loſe one part of his Kingdome? But our Sauiour contented himſelfe with heauen and earth to be vnder him and his dominion; and SaintMat. 28. 19 Phil. 2. 10. 
                  Paul attributes to his regiment things vnder earth, that is, in hell: and wil his Vicar needs haue a larger dominion then his Maſter? But indeed this is the true reaſon. For if hee ſhould make a goale deliuerie, out of this infernall priſon: then his chiefeſt ſway were gone, yea, and his reuenue too. It ſtands vpon him therefore not to bee pleaſed to deliuer any out of theſe paines, vnleſſe he bee well pleaſed for his paines: and if

hee bee ſo, then the ſoules ſhall flye out of that place to heauen in whole troupes, as they ſay they did, at the Prayer of a certaine holy man, &c. In their leaden Legend this dangerLegenda. lighteth vpon the head of their head, the Pope, which, according to their doctrine, can by no meanes be auoided: it were better then for him to forgoe his profit which ariſeth by purgatorie, then to vndergoe ſuch foule diſcredit.
               33. Another dangerous conſequence ariſeth hencefrom, to all the profeſſors of Religion in generall: that is, a feareful preſumption and ſecuritie of ſinning, when they are perſwaded, that after this life they may be releaſed from the paines of purgatorie by the prayers, almeſdeeds, Maſſes and other meritorious workes of the liuing: for who would bee afraid to ſinne, or carefull to make his ſaluation ſure in this life with feare and trembling, when hee beleeueth, that by giuing a ſumme of monie at his death for Maſſes and dirges to be ſung for his ſoule, he ſhall be certainly deliuered out of purgatory? This muſt needs caſt men into manifeſt preſumption, if not of all ſinnes, yet of veniall ſinnes, and ordinarie offences, which are to be purged by that fire, as they teach. Is not our doctrine more ſound and ſafe, that informeth vs, that ſuch as die in their ſinnes, ſinke downe to the loweſt Hell, as hopeleſſe after death to bee relieued by anything that can bee done for their ſakes by the liuing? doth not this teach men betimes to bee wiſe? and to finiſh vp the worke of their ſaluation before the night come? and make their peace with God, whilest they are here in the way of grace, not deluding their ſoules with a fond expectation of other mens deuotions? Sure it is, that the opinion of purgatorie and prayer for the dead, muſt of neceſſitie nouriſh a preſumption of veniall ſinnes at the leaſt, which our doctrine adiudgeth to hell, without repentance, aſwell as any other: and becauſe few are able to diſtinguiſh betwixt mortall and veniall ſinnes, but iudge them veniall which are to Gods iudgement mortall, as their Ieſuite Coſter confeſſeth,Coſter Enchirid. de ſide ſpecial. when hee ſayth, that that may ſeeme a light offence vnto man, which is haynous in Gods ſight: therefore it muſt needs alſo bee in danger to breed a ſecret preſumption of mortall ſinnes alſo.

And ſo, whileſt they haue a blind conceit of the ſuburbes, which is Purgatorie, they caſt themſelues into the Citie it ſelfe, which is hell.
               34. Laſtly, this may be demonſtrated to the conſcience of any, not preiudiced with a blind zeale to the Romiſh Church by this reaſon: for that neyther Purgatorie nor Prayer for the dead, can directly be proued out of Scripture, as hath bin proued before concerning Purgatory, and is apparent concerning prayer for the dead; there being neither precept nor promiſe, nor direct example in the whole volume of Gods Booke for the ſame, as is confeſſed by their owne Bredenbachius: andOſlander li. Papa non Papae, c. 17. beſides hauing no ſound foundation in the conſent of ancient Fathers, as hath beene alſo prooued: but being founded vpon vaine apparitions, and ſtrange reuelations of ſoules departed, which many of the Fathers were of opinion could not bee, as teſtifieth Maldonate, one of their owne Ieſuites: for feare,
                  Maldon. com. in Luc. 16. 
                  leſt vnder that colour we ſhould be drawne to ſuperſtitions: and others thought, that Deuils did faine themſelues to be the ſoules of dead men, as witneſſeth Pererius another Ieſuite: yea, andPerer de magia lib. 1. cap. 11. Salmer com. in Rom. 
                        •
                     . diſp. 52. ſome of their owne Doctours haue beene perſwaded, that all apparitions about Churches, are eyther demoniacall or phantaſticall: whereas on the contrarie, our doctrine of two places is direct in Scripture, and was neuer denied by any authoritie, either of olde or new Diuines: I meane poſſitiuely, that there is a Heauen and a Hell: wherefore, this wee may ſafely beleeue, and repoſe our ſoules vpon: but to entertaine the beliefe of the former is as dangerous to the conſcience, as doubtfull to the vnderſtanding: ſeeing hee that doubtingly vndertaketh any action, is condemned as a ſinner, becauſe hee
                  Rom. 14. 23. 
                  doth it not in faith: Faiths obiect being Gods Word alone, and not the vncertaine coniectures of humane opinions, much leſſe the vaine apparitions of dead ghoſts.
               35. Againe, their doctrine of the abſolute neceſſitie of12. baptiſme, excluding thereby infants from Heauen, and confining them to a Priſon in the brimme of Hell, there to indure the euerlaſting puniſhment of loſſe, is a dangerous doctrine, both in reſpect of pietie towards God, and charitie towards

our neighbour, and certaintie to a mans conſcience: and conſequently our doctrine that holdeth the contrarie, is more ſafe, in all thoſe reſpects. For touching pietie, it is a great imbaſing to Gods mercie, and a detracting from the glorie of his grace, to thinke that Almightie God ſhould in iuſtice caſt away the infinite myriades of vnbaptized infants, or that his ſauing grace is ſo tyed to the outward Sacrament, that he cannot, or at the leaſt, will not ſaue any without it: the firſt of theſe is confeſſed by many of the learned Romaniſts
                  Caiet. in 3. Thom. q. 68. art. 1. & 2. Biel in 4. Sent. diſt. 4 q. 2. Gerſon part. 2. p. 303. Bel. de baptiſ. lib. 1. cap. 4. themſelues, to be, à Dei miſericordia alienum, not agreeable to the mercie of God, which exceedeth not onely the deſerts, but euen the hopes of men. The ſecond is confirmed, by a due comparing of the olde couenant of the Law, with the new couenant of the Goſpell: for if it be true, that children dying vnder the Law vncircumciſed, were ſaued by the faith of their Parents (as Saint Bernard thinketh) yea, and is alſoBern. Epiſt. 77. ad. Hug

                     n. de S. Vict. agreeable to the tenure of the Scripture: for many children dyed in the Wilderneſſe without the Sacrament of Circumciſion: it being omitted for thoſe fortie yeeres by Gods own allowance: and Dauid hearing of the death of his childe, before hee had receiued the outward character of Circumciſion, as may be gathered out of the Text. did ſolace himſelfe with2. Sam. 12. this confidence, that the childe was ſaued. Then it muſt needs follow, if the ſame priuiledge be not granted to the children of Chriſtian Parents, that the couenant of the Goſpell is not ſo large, as the couenant of the Law: nor Gods mercie ſo bountifull to Chriſtians, as to Iewes; nor the merits of Chriſt ſo effectuall after his comming in the fleſh, as they were before: by all which the glorie of the Goſpell and grace of Chriſt is much defaced, and the vnbounded Ocean of Gods mercie limited and ſtinted.
               36. Touching charitie, is it not an vncharitable conceit, to deſpaire of the ſaluation of poore infants dying without Baptiſme? and that, both towards the infants themſelues, who though they are borne in originall ſinne, yet are innocent from actuall tranſgreſſions: and towards the Parents, who being themſelues within the couenant, hereby are depriued

of that chiefe comfort of the couenant, which is, that God is not onely their God, but the God of their ſeed: and towardes the Church, that hereby is robbed of a great part of her children, and made vnable to preſent young infants to her Huſband Chriſt Ieſus. Children are little beholding to them for this doctrine, Parents leſſe, and the Church, the mother of the faithfull leaſt of all. And indeed ſo farre is it from charitie, that it is full of damnable crueltie.
               37. Laſtly, touching the perilous conſequences that follow vpon this doctrine, I need name but theſe three, to wit, firſt, that it maketh God more mercifull to men of yeeres, then vnto tender infants: for they teach, that men of yeeres (as Valentinian the Emperour) may be ſaued, by the Baptiſme of the Spirit, or by the Baptiſme of bloud, which is Martyrdome, though they want the Baptiſme of water: but infants, albeit they may haue the Spirit of ſanctification, euen in the wombe, as Iohn Baptiſt had, and may be Martyrs according to
                  Bell de baptiſ. l. 1 cap 6. Mat. 2.
                   
                  their opinion, as the children that Herod cauſed to be ſlaine, yet if they want the Sacrament of water, they adiudge them peremptorily to be baniſhed from Gods preſence for euer. Now then children and men being in the ſame predicament: either the one muſt be admitted to Gods fauour aſwell as the other, or it muſt needs follow, that God is partial and more fauourable to the one then the other. If they ſay that men, though they haue not the act of Baptiſme, yet they haue votum, a deſire vnto it, which being intercepted by ſome ſodaine accident, is ſupplied by inward grace: I anſwere with Bellarmine, thatBell. de baptiſ. l. 1 cap. 9. 
                  as another mans ſinne was the cauſe of the damnation of infants, ſo other mens faith ſufficeth them vnto baptiſme. Why ſhould then the deſire of one man be of more efficacie to his ſaluation, then the deſire and purpoſe of the Church for the ſaluation of infants? To this purpoſe their owne learned SchoolemanAquin. 3. part. q. 68. & 69. ſayth, that the child before it bee baptized, is in ſome ſort partaker of the Sacrament of Baptiſme, euen by the faith of the Church, which hath vowed him thereunto. And Bonauenture, asCaſſand. de baptiſ. Infant. fol. 148. par. altera. hee is reported by Caſſander, ſayth, that infants are diſpoſed vnto Baptiſme, not according to any act of their owne, but according
                  
                  to the act of other: becauſe the mercie of God imputeth to them as their owne will, the will of another. Inſants therefore ſtand ſtill in as good caſe in euery reſpect, as men of yeares, if not in better, both being vnbaptized, and the one dedicated to God by their owne deſire, the other by the purpoſe & deſire of the Church: and therefore, either theſe may bee ſaued aſwell as they, or elſe God is not ſo mercifull to them, as to theſe: which is no leſſe then impietie to thinke, and blaſphemie to pronounce.
               38. Another wicked conſequence that followeth vpon this doctrine, is, that it maketh God the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt, euen that bleſſed Trinitie, that is the fountaine of all truth and goodneſſe, to be lyars and teachers of vntruth. For God the Father ſayth to Abraham, I will bee

                  thy God, and the God of thy ſeed. And that this is not to bee vnderſtood of the ſeed of Abraham according to the fleſh onely, to wit, the Iewes, but much more of his ſeed according to the Spirit, which are faithfull Chriſtians, may appeare both by that which is in the verie ſame place, where it is calledGal 3. 14. an euerlaſting couenant, and by Saint Pauls teſtimonie, who affirmeth that the bleſſing of Abraham was to come on the Gentiles through Chriſt Ieſus, aſwell as on the Iewes. God the Sonne ſayth, Suffer little children to come vnto me, for of ſuch
                  Mat 19. 14. 
                  is the Kingdome of Heauen: plainly affirming that the Kingdome of Heauen is pertaining to little children, and not barred vp againſt any, as our Romaniſts teach it is, againſt ſuch little ones as dye without baptiſme. Our Sauiour ſaith without exception, that the Kingdome of Heauen belongeth vnto them: they, as it were to make him a lyar, bring in an exception and ſay, that except they bee baptized, not Heauen, but Lymbus belongeth vnto them. And the holy Ghoſt by the mouth of Saint Paul ſayth, That the children of beleeuing
                  1. Cor. 7. 14. 
                  Parents are holy: the reaſon is, becauſe the root is holy, and therefore the branch muſt needs be holy: and if children may be holy before they be baptized then by the ſame rule they may goe to Heauen before they be baptized: for as no man without holineſſe can ſee God: ſo with holineſſe none can be baniſhed out of the ſight
                  
                  of God. And thus this doctrine giueth the lye to euery perſon of the bleſſed Trinitie.
               39. If they ſay, that it is our Sauiours doctrine, that except a man be borne againe of water and the holy Ghoſt, hee cannot enter into the Kingdome of Heauen, and therefore, all thoſe generall promiſes are to bee reſtrained by this exception (if they bee baptized:) I anſwere out of Bellarmine, that God is not tyed to his Sacraments, but can ſaue them by

                  his eſpeciall grace: as alſo witneſſe diuers others of their learned Doctours. And therefore, whereas our Sauiour ſaith, Except a man be borne againe, &c. it muſt needs be vnderſtood by another exception, to wit, of caſes of neceſſitie, where Baptiſme cannot be obtained, and is not contemned: for not the want, but the contempt of Baptiſme is damnable.
               40. The third and laſt inconuenience that ariſeth from this doctrine, is, that it is the mother of diuers ſtrange paradoxes and groſſe abſurdities, as not onely of Lay mens Baptiſme, yea, of Pagans, and that in ſcorne, but alſo of changing the true element into lee, or broth, or puddle water, and that which is moſt ſtrange, of baptizing the childe in the mothers wombe before it bee borne, or ripping vp the mothers belly, in caſe the child be in danger of death, &c. ſome of all which abſurdities are held by them all, and all by ſome. Is it not then more ſafe to hold that opinion which is more reſpectiue to Gods glorie, agreeable to Chriſtian charitie, and free from all theſe dangerous conſequences?
               41. To conclude, omitting many other of their doctrines,13. which might eaſily bee ſhewne to ſtand in the ſame caſe of dangerous tenure, and hath in part alreadie beene manifeſted; as their doctrine of ſet faſts, implicite faith, veniall ſins, diſpenſations with others more: I propound for the laſt inſtance, that doctrine of doctrines, the verie groundcell of their ruinous Religion, touching the veritie, authoritie and ſingularitie of their Church, which they vaunt and bragge to be the onely true Catholike Church of Chriſt, and to haue a preeminence ouer the Scriptures, and without the which to be no poſſibilitie of ſaluation: that there is no ſafetie in theſe

poſitions many reaſons will euince, as firſt, if it ſhould bee true, that out of the bounds of that Church, none could bee ſaued then thoſe famous Churches of Aſia, which were in Pope 
                     Ʋictors time, that oppoſed themſelues againſt the predominance of the Church of Rome, were all damned, wherein flouriſhed many holy Martyrs that gaue vp their liues for the teſtimonie of Ieſus. Then Saint Cyprian and all the Biſhops of Carthage, to the number of foureſcore, that in a Councell at Carthage ſet themſelues againſt Pope Stephen and his Councell, were damned: and Saint Cyprian muſt bee no longer a Martyr but a Schiſmaticke; and then S. Auguſtine with the whole Church of Africa and troupes of Martyrs and Confeſſors ſhould not bee crowned with bliſſe, but tormented in hell, for they reiected the yoke of the Biſhop of Romes authoritie, and would not admit that any ſhould make appeales from them to Rome. This horrible and vncharitable inconuenience doth ariſe from that diſmall doctrine, The Church of Rome is the onely Catholike Church, and out of it there is no hope of ſaluation: now that theſe holy and heauenly Martyrs and Confeſſors of Ieſus Chriſt were out of it, appeareth by their moſt receiued definitions, of a Catholike and a Schiſmaticke: A Catholike (faith Bellarmine) is
                  Bell. de Eccleſ. milit. lib. 3. ca. 2. 
                  he, that is ſubiect to the one Paſtor the Pope, whereby hee mak
                        •
                     th the eſſentiall forme of a Catholike, to be his vnion and coniunction
                  Tollet. inſtruct. Sacerdot. l. 1. ca. 19. 
                  with his head the Pope: and a Schiſmatike (ſayth Tollet.) is hee that doth ſeparate himſelfe from the head of the Church and the Vicar of Chriſt. I aſſume but Cyprian, Auguſtine, and thoſe other famous Biſhops did not acknowledge any ſubiection to the Pope, but ſeparated themſelues from his dominion; therefore they were by their doctrine no Catholickes but Schiſmatickes, and conſequently out of the Church, and ſo out of ſaluation: a damnable concluſion.
               42. Secondly, they peremptorily auouch, that none of vs being not members of their Church, can bee ſaued: we on the contrarie charitably beleeue, that many of them that are ignorantly members of their Church, if they hold the foundation

of Ieſus Chriſt, and depend vpon his merits, not their owne, ſo that their ignorance be ſimple and vnaffected, may bee ſaued. And hereupon they conclude, that it is ſafer to bee of that Church, wherein by our owne confeſſion, a man may be ſaued: then of that to which they denie all hope of ſaluation: but it is a concluſion made by confuſion. For who ſeeth not, that that is more likely to be the true Church, which is animated with charitie, then that which is void of charitie? and that it is ſafer to harbour vnder her wings, that is charitably affected euen towards her enemies, then vnder her, that is ſo miſcarried with enuie, that ſhe committeth all to the pit of Hell, that are not of her fellowſhip and profeſſion: eſpecially, ſeeing Saint Paul chargeth the Theſſalonians, that If
                  2. Theſ. 3. 14. 
                  any man obey not the Goſpell, they ſhould note him with a letter and haue no companie with him, that hee may bee aſhamed, yet
                  2. Theſ. 3. 14. 15 
                  they ſhould not accout him as an enemie, but admoniſh him as a brother? If then it be ſafer to thinke charitably of thoſe that are without, then vtterly to condemne them all: then it muſt be alſo ſafer to bee a member of our Church then of theirs. And to make the matter more cleare, Saint Auguſtine is flat ofAug. init. Epiſt. 162 Glorio. & 
                        •
                     lenſio, &c. our mind; to thinke more Chriſtianlike of Heretikes (as they repute vs) then they doe: for writing againſt the Donatiſts, thus he ſayth, They that defend their falſe doctrine without obſtinate boldneſſe, eſpecially, if they be not ſuch as haue beene authors of thoſe errours, but either receiued them from their Parents, or were ſeduced by others, and doe carefully ſeeke the truth, being readie to be reformed, aſſoone as they ſhall ſee their errours: ſuch men are not to be eſteemed as Heretikes. Thus writeth Saint Auguſtine, whereby hee condemneth the practice of the Church of Rome, and iuſtifieth ours as more agreeable to the rule of charitie: and thus, that reaſon whereby the Ieſuites ſeduce many ignorant perſons, falleth to the ground, and maketh more againſt them, then for them.
               43. Thirdly, if the Churches authoritie bee aboue the authoritie of the Scriptures, then are men to bee preferred before God, and that which is ſubiect to errour, before that which can neither erre nor deceiue: for the Church conſiſts

of men: but the Scripture is immediately from God, and the Church may erre, though not in fundamentall points: but the Scripture cannot erre, no not in the leaſt titte: the truth of this allegation is grounded vpon thoſe reaſons. Firſt, becauſe euery particular Church may erre, as is confeſſed, and therefore the whole Chuchin generall may erre alſo: for ſuch as is the nature of the parts, is the nature alſo of the whole. Secondly, Councels, which are their Church repreſentatiue, haue erred, as is notoriouſly knowne to all, and confeſſed by Saint Auguſtine, who ſayth, that the decrees of prouinciall
                  Aug. de baptiſ. cont. Donatiſt. lib. 2 cap. 3. 
                  Councels are ſubiect to reprehenſion. Yea, former generall Councels may be corrected by them that follow, as the Councell of Arimine, by the Councell of Conſtantinople, the ſecond of Epheſus, by the Councell of Chalcedon: the Councell of Carthage, by the firſt of Nice, and the ſecond of Nice, by the Councell of Franckeford. Thirdly, the Pope, that is, the Head of the Church, hath erred; this is alſo confeſſed, therefore the bodie can claime no better priuiledge: but ſayth the ſame Auguſtine, There is no doubt of the truth of any thing
                  Idem ibid. 
                  which is contained in the Scripture. Therefore, who can doubt to place the reſolution of their faith, as the ſafeſt courſe on the Scripture, rather then on the Church; eſpecially, ſeeing no particular writer of the holy Scripture can be taxed with the leaſt errour but many particular parts of the Church, whether we reſpect the imagined head, which is vertually the whole Church, in their eſtimation, or the chiefe members in groſſe, as the Councels, or the deuided ioynts, as particular Congregations, may iuſtly be challenged, as tainted with diuers errours in doctrines of faith.
               44. Laſtly, the Church of Rome may be the whore of Babylon, and ſo the See of Antichriſt, if not neceſſarily as wee auouch, yet coniecturally as no man can denie; becauſe ſpirituall Babylon is ſaid to bee a Citie ſituate vpon ſeuen hils, and not onely ſo, but that raigned ouer the Kings of the earth; both which notes directly agree to the Citie of Rome: but the Church of Proteſtants cannot by any likelihood bee that whore, ſeeing neither of thoſe markes doe in any reſpect

belong vnto it. Is it not ſafer then, to reſt our ſelues in her boſome, which by al probabilitie is an honeſt Matrone, then in her armes, which is a ſuſpected harlot? If Caeſar would haue his wife to bee without ſuſpition, then euerie Chriſtian had need to looke to his faith, whereunto he is as it were married by the Spirit of God, & wherby he is married vnto Chriſt, that it be not onely ſincere, but alſo free from all ſuſpition or likelihood of errour.
               45. Thus we ſee, in theſe few maine points of the Romiſh Religion, compared with our contrarie aſſertions, that it is a farre ſafer courſe, to bee a Proteſtant, then a Papiſt: let all indifferent perſons iudge and diſcerne betwixt vs: and I pray God direct them by his Spirit to chooſe the truth.
               46. There is one thing yet remaining, whereby this may14. further appeare, and ſo and end of this whole diſcourſe: and that is, that there is no one point of doctrine wherein they differ from vs, but is contradicted by ſome of their owne learned Writers ſhaking hands with vs, and croſſing their owne Pew-fellowes: whence from, ariſeth not onely another ſtrong argument of greater ſecuritie in our Religion then in theirs, which hath the ſuffrages of the greateſt enemies to vphold it, but alſo of vnreſiſtable truth, which worketh ſo vpon the conſciences of the aduerſaries thereof, that it forceth them, will they, nill they, to acknowledge it, now and then, as the Deuill himſelfe was conſtrained to confeſſe Chriſt Ieſus to be the Sonne of God. I might write a whole Volume of this point alone: but I will propound here onely ſome few inſtances, and ſo ſhut vp this Treatiſe.
               47. Proteſtants teach that a man is iuſtified by faith alone,1. whereby the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt is imputed vnto him: and not by the inherent or adherent righteouſneſſe of his owne workes: the ſame is confeſſed by Thomas Aquinas,
                  
                     Aquin. in Gal. 3. lect. 4. & in Rom 3. lect. 4. & in 1. Tim. 1. lect. 3. Pighius cont. Rat. ſpon. cont. 3. pag. 47. who ſayth, that no man is iuſtified with God by his workes, but by the habit of faith infuſed: and againe, that there is in the workes of the Law, no hope of iuſtification, but by faith onely: and by Pighius, who holdeth, that there is in vs no inherent righteouſneſſe whereby wee may bee iuſtified, but that our iuſtification
                  
                  is by Chriſts righteouſneſſe imputed vnto vs: and by the Diuines of Collen, who affirme, That the righteouſneſſe of

                  Christ imputed vnto vs, and apprehended by faith, is the principall cauſe of our iuſtification: and by Caſſander, who approueth
                     Caſſander conſul. art. 4. de Iuſtif.
                   of our doctrine of iuſtification by faith alone, and imputed righteouſneſſe, So that wee exclude not from this faith, repentance, amendment of life, new obedience, &c. Laſtly, by Ferus Stapulenſis, Peraldus, and diuers others, yea, almoſt all of them, when at the point of death they come to the point of try all, flye to this ſacred anchor of Chriſts righteouſneſſe alone, renouncing all righteouſneſſe in themſelues, as the famous example of Stephen Gardiner declareth, who lying on his death-bed, repoſed himſelfe on the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt only, for his ſaluation: and being told, that it was contrarie to his former reſolution, anſwered, that though it was the truth, yet that gappe was not to bee opened to the people.
               48. The Proteſtants hold, that our beſt workes are ſtayned2. with ſo many imperfections, that they cannot merit any thing at Gods hand, except it be hell fire and damnation; and that though God of his mercie reward good workes with eternall life, yet it is not for any condignity that is in them, but for Chriſts ſake, into whom the partie working is ingrafted and made a member. Many learned Romaniſts are of the ſame opinion: Bellarmine ſayth, that in regard of the vncertaintie

                  of our owne righteouſneſſe, and danger of vaine glorie, the ſafeſt way is, to put our confidence in the ſole mercie and goodneſſe of God. Waldenſis writeth, Hee is a ſounder Diuine, a faithfuller Catholicke, and more agreeing to the Scriptures, that ſimply denieth merits, and ſayth that the Kingdome of Heauen is from the mere grace and will of the giuer; not from any deſert of the Receiuer. Of the ſame opinion was Albertus Pighius, as witneſſeth Bellarmine. Ferus ſayth, Whatſoeuer God giueth vs, is of grace, not of debt. If therefore thou deſire to hold the grace and fauour of God, make no mention of thy merits. The ſame hold Gregorius Ariminenſis, Durandus,
                  Stella in Luc. c. 7 
                  Stella, with many more, renouncing all the new Rhemiſh
                  
doctrine of merits of condignitie, taught by the Schoole, & fourbiſhed ouer by the Councell of Trent, and refining Ieſuites. All theſe being ſworne ſubiects to the Church of Rome, yet being conſtrained by the conſcience of the truth, doe as fully and perfectly maintaine our doctrine, as if they were the rankeſt Proteſtants in the World.
               49. Proteſtants denie all free will to grace, before it bee3. quickned and liued by Gods Spirit. Many learned Romaniſts teach the ſame doctrine. Laurentius Ʋalla (as Bellarmine
                  
                     Bel. de grat. & lib. arbit. l. 4. c. 5. Lumbard. lib. 2. diſt. 25. reports) wiſhed that the name of free-will were vtterly taken away. The Maſter of Sentences auouched, that free-will, before grace repaire it, is preſſed & ouercome with cōcupiſcence, & hath weakneſſe in euill, but no grace in good; and therefore cannot but
                  Dom. Bannes 2. q. 24. 
                  ſinne damnably. Dom. Bannes affirmeth, that it is falſe, and worſe then falſe, that any man, without the ſpeciall and ſupernaturall helpe of God, can be able to doe a ſupernaturall act. Ariminenſis
                  
                     Ariminenſ. 2. d. 29. art. 2. Suarez de auxil. grat. lib. 3. c. 20. calleth the Romiſh doctrine of free-wil, Pelagianiſme. The Ieſuite Suarez ſayth, that diuers Romaniſts ſay, that it is a raſh and hereticall opinion to affirme, that when grace is equally offered to two, that one of them could be conuerted, and not the other. What could any Proteſtant ſay more?
               50. Tranſubſtantiation, circumgeſtation, and ſubtraction4. of the Cuppe, are denyed by many of their owne ſide, as well as by vs. Durand ſayth, It is great raſhneſſe to thinke, the

                  inſtitution. Pope Gelaſius (witneſſe Gregorie of 
                     Ʋalintia)Greg. de Valent. lib. 2. de Idolat. cap. 5. Caſſand. conſult. art. 22. ſaid, that the ſubſtance of the bread and wine in the Euchariſt doe not loſe their nature. Touching abſtraction of the Cuppe, their learned Caſſander acknowledgeth, that for the ſpace of a thouſand yeeres after Chriſt, the people communicated in both kindes: and that in Greece and Armenia they doe ſtill: and the beſt Catholickes earneſtly deſire a reformation of this matter in the Church of Rome. And Durand their Schooleman,Durand. Ration. l. 4. c. 55. 
                  that the receiuing in one kind onely, is not a full ſacrament all receiuing: for though that in the conſecrated hoaſt Christs bloud bee contained, yet it is not there ſacramentally, in that the bread ſignifieth the bodie, and not the bloud: and the wine the bloud, and not the bodie.

               51. Auricular confeſſion is denied by Proteſtants, to be neceſſarie for the remiſſion of ſinnes, and to bee commanded by God. The ſame is auerred by Panormitane, Pereſius, Bonauenture, Medina, Rhenanus, Eraſmus, Caietane, &c. all of them concluding with one voyce, that it is a doctrine deriued onely from a poſitiue Law of the Church, and not from the Law of God; yea, and the laſt that is named (to wit Cardinall Caietane) is bold to ſay, that it is ſo farre from being commanded, that euery one ſhould be ſhriuen, before hee come to the Communion; that the contrarie is inſinuated by the Apoſtle, where hee ſayth, Let a mantry himſelfe: And Gratian confeſſeth; that Ambroſe, Auguſtine, Chryſoſtome, Theophilact, and other Greeke Fathers thought, that ſecret confeſſion was not neceſſarie. And laſtly, Acoſta, a famous Ieſuite, auoucheth, that it would be well for the Indians, if the bond of confeſſion might bee taken away, leſt they ſhould bee constrained to commit ſo many and ſo grieuous ſacriledges.
               
               
                  52. So the Romiſh doctrine of ſatisfactions is vtterly condemned6. by Proteſtants; and not onely by them, but by many of their owne learned Doctours: for the Diuines of Louaine (as Bellarmine witneſſeth of them) and others, did certainlyBell. de Indulg. lib. 1. cap. 4. defend, that the ſufferings of Saints cannot bee true ſatisfactions, but that our puniſhments are remitted onely by the perſonall ſatisfaction of Chriſt. And Panormitane ſayth, that a man may be inwardly ſo penitent and contrite, that he ſhall need no ſatisfaction at all, but may bee abſolued preſently without any penance doing. And another, that the treaſure of Indulgences
                  Vide Mortons Apol. lib. 2. cap. 12. p. 398. 
                  doth conſiſt onely of the merits of Chriſt, and not of the ſatisfactions of Saints, becauſe the merits of Chriſt are of infinite valew.

                  Alphonſus, flatly affirme, that no worſhip at all is due to an Image, neither is it lawfull to worſhip it: diuers Councels alſo decreed the ſame, as the ancient Councell of Eliberis propounded this onely remedie againſt Idolatrie, that no Images ſhould bee painted in Churches: but this Councell was not Romiſh, for Poperie was then ſcarce in the Embrio: therefore of later time a mere Romiſh Councell, to wit, that of Franckford, conſiſting of many Romiſh Biſhops and the Popes owne Legates, condemned all worſhip of Images: and a later yet, to wit, the Councell of Mentz, held in the yeere 1549. decreed, that the Image it ſelfe was not to bee worſhipped: but that by the Image of Chriſt, men ſhould bee ſtirred vp to adore Chriſt: which is contrarie to the new profeſſed doctrine of the Church of Rome.

Of the ſame opinion was Ecchius, who peremptorilyEcchius Enchir. Faber Stapul. praef. in Euang. affirmeth, that the inuocation of Saints departed, is not commanded in the holy Scripture. And Faber Stapulenſis thus writeth, I would to God, that the forme of beleeuing might bee fetcht from the Primitiue Church, which conſecrated ſo many Martyrs to Chriſt, and had no ſcope but Chriſt, nor imployed any worſhip to any, ſaue to the one Trinity alone.

That a Chriſtian may bee certaine of his owne ſtanding9. in preſent grace, and of his future ſaluation, is the doctrine of Proteſtants, denyed by the Church of Rome, and yet approued by many of her deare children: as for example: Euery one that beleeueth, ſeeth that he doth beleeue (ſayth Dominicus

Caietane affirmeth, that if wee ſtand onely to the tradition of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, it cannot appeare by any authoritie or reaſon, that holy order can be any hinderance to marriage, eyther as it is an order, or as it is holy. Pius the ſecond, one of their owne Popes, affirmeth, that it is better for a Prieſt to marry, then to burne, though hee haue vowed the contrary: and that there be many reaſons to forbid Prieſts marriage, but more to allow it.

                  vnderſtanding. Antoninus ſaith, that God hath ſpoken but once, and that in the holy Scripture, and that ſo plentifully, to meet with all temptations, and all caſes that may fall out. Gerſon ſaith, that the Scripture is the rule of our faith, which being well vnderſtood, no authority of men is to be admitted againſt it. Gonradus Clingius ſaith, that the Scripture is the infallible rule of truth, yea the meaſure and Iudge of the truth. Pereſius ſaith, that the authority of no Saint is of infallible truth, for that honour is due only to the Scripture. Yea, Bellarmine their Ring-leader confeſſeth the Scripture to be the moſt certaine, and moſt ſafe rule of faith. Franciſcus Victoria ſaith, that the Pope, in diſpenſing againſt the Decrees, Councels, and former Popes, may erre and grieuouſly ſinne. Alphonſus de Caſtro diueth deeper, and ſaith,Alphonſ. de Caſt. l. 1. c. 4. aduerſ. haereſ. Bozius tom. 2. de ſig. Eccleſ. l. 28 c. vlt. Almayn. Qu. in Veſper. that euery man, yea the Pope, and that as he is Pope, and Paſtor of the Church, may be deceiued. Bozius pierceth yet deeper, and ſaith, that the Pope may be an Heretike, yea write, teach, and preach hereſie. And laſtly, Almayne ſaith, that the power of not erring in the faith is not alway in the Pope. Are not all theſe now Proteſtants in this point? But for fuller ſatisfaction in this point, I referre the Reader to the reuerent and iudicious Deane of Wincheſter, Doctor Morton, with others, who haue largely and learnedly diſcouered this matter in their writings.
               60. The like might bee ſhewne in all other points: theſe few inſtances therefore ſhall ſuffice for this time, to perſwade that it is farre more ſafe to ſubſcribe to the Religion of Proteſtants, then of Romaniſts: ſeeing we hold nothing, which many of their owne ranke and order doe not maintayne aſwell as we; and what, I pray you, could mooue them thus to doe, being ſworne ſubiects to the Church of Rome, but the euidence of truth, which ſhined ſo cleerely to their conſciences, that they neither could, nor durſt gaine-ſay the ſame?
            
            
               
               Concluſion.
               NOw then, gentle Reader, theſe things being thus cleerly proued, viz, Firſt, that the Religion of the Church of Rome giueth open libertie to ſinne. Secondly, that it maintayneth by the grounds therof, things forbidden by all lawes, Diuine, Naturall, and Humane. Thirdly, that it imitateth the Iewes in thoſe things, wherein they are enemies to Chriſt. Fourthly, that it derogateth from the glorie of Gods mercy, and efficacy of the merits of Chriſt, in the worke of our redemption. Fiftly, that it refuſeth to bee tryed by the Scriptures, and will be iudged and tryed by none, but it ſelfe. Sixtly, that it is at defiance and profeſt enmitie with the ſacred Scriptures. Seuenthly, that it maintayneth groſſe and palpable Idolatrie. Eightly, that it is contrary to it ſelfe by manifeſt contradictions. Ninthly, that it is apparently oppoſite to the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt. Tenthly, that it nouriſheth groſſe and barbarous ignorance amongſt the people. Eleuenthly, that it was neuer knowne nor heard of in the Apoſtles time, nor in the primitiue Church. Twelfthly, that it vpholdeth it ſelfe by vnlawfull, vniuſt and vngodly meanes: and laſtly, that it is dangerous and vnſafe, both in reſpect of Gods glorie, mans conſcience, and Chriſtian charitie. I ſay, all theſe things being thus cleerely demonſtrated; what remayneth, but that wee abhorre the ſame, as the Religion of the great Whore, and her Paramour Antichriſt, who with their cup of fornications, and vaine pretext of Peters authoritie, haue beſotted heretofore all Nations of the earth? and cleaue to the ſinceritie of the Goſpell, taught and profeſſed in the Church of Proteſtants, which is free from all theſe imputations; for it neither giueth libertie to ſinne, nor maintayneth any thing that is vnlawfull, nor imitateth the Iewes; aſcribeth all the worke of our redemption to Gods mercy, and Chriſts merits onely, deſireth to bee tryed and examined by the Scriptures; reuerenceth the fulneſſe and perfection thereof;

abhorreth all ſhew of Idolatrie, is not at enmity and oppoſition, but keepeth a ſweet harmony with it ſelfe: doth not croſſe the Goſpell, not ſo much as in ſhew: condemneth and laboureth againſt ignorance; is agreeable to the doctrine of the Apoſtles, and primitiue Church; maintayneth it ſelfe by no vnlawfull meanes: and laſtly, hath great ſafetie and ſecuritie, in the profeſſion thereof. Good Chriſtians muſt bee like good Gold-ſmiths, who will not take a piece of gold of any mans word, but will trie it by the touch-ſtone, and weigh it in the ballance. The Truth is like gold: it behoueth all therefore, to trie it and weigh it, before they entertayne it into their ſoules, leſt they receiue in ſtead of pure mettall, that which is counterfeit and light; trie therefore theſe two Religions, which of them hath the truth, and without partialitie or affection retayne the good, and reiect the counterfeit: remember that the truth of Chriſtians (as Saint Auguſtine ſaith) is more
                  Aug. Epiſt. ad Hieron. Ambroſ. in Ser. 
                  beautifull incomparably, then Helene of the Grecians: and that it alone (as Saint Ambroſe ſaith) freeth; alone ſaueth; alone waſheth: and therefore though it be hid in a deepe pit (as the Philoſopher ſaid) yet it is diligently to be digged for, of all them that deſire the ſaluation of their ſoules. In a word, let not the darke miſts of error and ſuperſtition blinde thine eyes, but open them wide to the beholding of the bright light of truth, that ſhineth round about thee, and know, that if the Goſpell be hid, it is hid to them that periſh, in whom the god of
                  2. Cor. 4. 
                  this world hath dazeled their mindes, that they ſhould not ſee the light of the glorious Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt. I deſire no more credit at thy hands, then the euidence of theſe reaſons produced do require: and therefore if they be true, then yeeld aſſent vnto them for thine owne ſoules ſake: if they be falſe, declare for my ſoules ſake wherein the falſhood lurketh, and I will be as ready to recant, as thou to refute. The Lord of his mercy anoint both our eyes with the eye-ſalue of his Spirit, that we may ſee the truth, and ſupply them with the oyle of his grace, that we may bow and bend vnto it, and ſtrengthen vs with his diuine power, that wee may conſtantly profeſſe and perſeuere

in the ſame to our liues ends: faxit Deus for his only begotten Sonne, and our only bleſſed Sauiour Ieſus Chriſts ſake, to whom b
