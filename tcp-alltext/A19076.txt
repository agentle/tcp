            ¶A prologue to the reader.
            
               
                  HERE haſt thou
(moſte deare & gentle
Reader) the two
Bookes of that famous
Clercke and
auncient father S.
Ambroſe, ſometime
Byſhop of Milleyn, entituled: Of the
vocation and callyng of all Nacions.
A worke ſurely of no leſſe diuine wyſedome
and learnyng, then of antiquitie:
and therefore a Iewell greatly to
be eſteemed and had in price of al thoſe
that be Godlye in Chriſtes Churche,
who earneſtly deſire a right ſpirite and
iudgement purely to diſcerne betwene
trueth and errour in theſe peryllous
dayes: Wherin as our Sauiour Ieſus
Chriſt affirmeth,Math. 24. that (yf it were poſſible)
the very electe myght be diſceyued.
But chiefly it is to be had in priceMark. 13.
of all thoſe, who not hauyng the Latin
tongue, are not able to reade the work
to theyr edifying in the tongue wherin
it was firſte wrytten and compyled.
To whom the ſayde auncient Father
and famous Clercke in this preſente

treatiſe, ſpeaketh nowe more familiarly
then before. The worke it ſelfe is
ſuch as needeth not my praiſe: But ſeyng
I can not ſufficiently expreſſe the
woorthyneſſe thereof, I thynke it better
to omitt it with ſcilence, confeſſing
my barreyneſſe, then for lacke of conuenient
ſpeache to diminiſhe the glory
therof. Theſe and ſuche lyke workes
haue not aforetyme ben ſo freely offered
to the vnderſtanding of the ſimple,
nor ſo eaſely come by, as (God be bleſſed
for it) they are in theſe our dayes.
Receiue them therefore louyngly and
thanckfullye (good Chriſten Reader)
and vſe them godly aud reuerently: for
they are the good inſtruments & tooles
wherby the eternall God buyldeth the
ſpirituall Ieruſalem his Churche,1. peter. 2. and
by whom the lyuyng ſtones therof, his
elect children, are dayly wrought, ſhapen,
& full faſhioned vnto euerlaſtyng
lyfe.2. Tim. 3. Learne alſo to render vnto God
moſte heartye thanckes therfore: who
ſhewyng more mercye vnto thee, then
vnto manye generations paſte. As he
hath cauſed thee to be borne in theſe
peryllous dayes: ſo hath he prepared
armure and weapon for thee, wherewith

thou maiſt defend thy ſelf againſt
all thoſe enemies that ſhall aryſe vp agaynſt
thee. The occaſion that moued
Saint Ambroſe to wryte this woorke
was this. There aroſe in Britayne in
thoſe dayes a Monke named Pelagius
Byſhop of Bangor, that became the
aucthour of a new ſect before that time
not heard of. This man with the helpe
of Celeſtine & Iulian his fautors, drew
many into his errour: He attributed
ſo much vnto the free will of man, that
he affirmed that a man mought atteine
lyfe euerlaſtyng by merites only without
the grace of Chriſt. Wherof he beyng
blamed, gaue place to thadmonition,
in ſuche ſorte, that he dyd not afterwarde
altogether exclude grace: but
ſayd, that yf grace were geuen, it was
the eaſyer to attayne to ſaluacion, how
beit without it, it mought be obteyned
though with more difficultie. He condempned
praying in the congregatiō,
aſwell for the faythfull as for the vnfaythfull,
as a thing vayne and vnprofitable:
becauſe (as he ſaid) that which
they ſhould aſke, was already in their
power, which with their diligence euery
one of them myght do & perfourme.

But when he feared leaſt he ſhould be
condempned for it by the councell of
Antioche, he recanted, althoughe he
ceaſſed not afterwardes to teach the
ſame in his wrytinges. He added furthermore,
that the ſinne of Adam hurted
no man but him that committed it.
Alſo that all Infantes were borne as
innocent & cleane from ſinne, as Adam
was when God firſt created hym. Neuertheleſſe
he permitted them to bee
baptized, not to the puttyng awaye of
ſinne, whereof he affirmed them to be
voyde: but that they might be honored
with the Sacrament of their adoption.
And when he was publyſſhed and proclaymed
to be an hereticke: he wrote
in the defence of his errour. He was
condempned by Zoſimus, and twoo
C.xl. Byſhoppes moe in the councell
of Carthage: and before that, he
was condempned bi Innocentius, whoſe
errour whē the Affricans with others
(eſpecially this aucthour S. Ambroſe,
S. Auguſtine, and S. Iherome) vtterly
deteſted, they tooke in hand by their
ſeuerall wrytynges to put to ſcilence
the remnaunte of that ſecte. Sithens
the which time it hath ben reputed and

taken of all the godly learned in Chryſtes
Churche, for a curſed prophane &
Phyloſophycall errour.
            I haue ſhewed thee (gentle Reader)
the cauſe or reaſon of the firſt makyng
and compylyng of this worke. Nowe
it ſtandeth me in ſteede to ſhewe thee
the cauſe of this my trauell in reducing
it into the Englyſhe tongue. There aroſe
in Kent in theſe late dayes, namely
ſithens the preachyng of the Goſpel,
a priuate man altogether vnlearned,
named Henry Hart, that reuiued this
errour of Pelagius, and added thereto
certeyne other errours. This man
with the helpe of his adherentes, newe
furbed this olde cancred hereſye, and
put it to ſale a freſſhe in ſtede of an infallible
veritie, who alſo vnder the pretence
of a ſober lyfe and conuerſation
vſyng long heare, long bearde, long
garmētes, & often reading of pſalmes,
drewe manye into his errour both in
Eaſtkent, in Eſſex, Suſſex, Surrey, &
in the Citie of London.
            This man, after that his errour was
eſpyed by the late Tharchbiſhoppe of
Caunterburye Thomas Cranmer,
was by hym committed to priſon, with

certeyne of his ſecte (of whom ſome
remayne alyue, holdynge that errour,
ſome thanked be God are become
newe men, and other ſome are departed
this lyfe) and there they remayned
vntyll they reuoked theyr errour, and
colourably ſubſcrybed to the Artycles
agreed vpon in the Synode holden at
London, in the reigne of the late kyng
Edwarde the ſixte. Notwithſtanding
in hucker mucker he euer taught the
ſame vnto thoſe only which he knewe
to be truſtye, and vnto thoſe that were
brought in by them: who held the ſaid
Harte in ſuch reputacion, as yf he had
ben an holy Prophete. But after the
death of kyng Edwarde, when Quene
Mary began her dominion, & the Chriſtian
Clergie was ſcattered abrode,
this Hart and his companions began
to ſhewe them ſelues in theyr old lykenes
of errour agayne, with much more
errour whiche they in the meane tyme
had practiſed, forged, and gathered,
with whom (when diuers of our company
chaunced to meete in the time of
perſecution) we hadde more to do, then
we had with al the reſt of our enemies.
            And becauſe (deare Reader) thou

ſhouldeſt not be ignoraunt of theyr errour,
I haue noted ſome parte of it in
certeyne perticulers here folowyng.
            1. Firſt they holde and affirme, that
the doctrine of predeſtination and election,
as it was taught of the Chriſten
Clergie of this Realm in the reigne of
kyng Edwarde the ſyxte, and agreed
vpon in the Synode of London. Anno.
domini. 1552. is not a doctrine meete
or neceſſary to be taught in the Church
of God.
            2. Secondly, that they that hold the
ſayd doctrine, do erre dampnably.
            3. Thirdly, that God hath predeſtinated
or elected man none otherwyſe
then vpon the condicion of the kepyng
of the lawe: the whiche yf man on his
part do not obſerue, he loſeth his predeſtination
and election.
            4. Fourth, that no man is ſo reprobated
but that he maye eſcape it, and
become an elect and be ſaued, nor any
man ſo elected but that he may loſe his
election, become a reprobate and be
dampned, by godly or vngodly lyuyng.
            5. Fyfth, that Eſau was no more
reproued then Iacob, nor Iacob anye

more elected then Eſau, before the one
of them had lyued godly, and the other
vngodly.
            6. Sixth, that all men vniuerſallye
are called with one & the ſame callyng,
the wicked aſwell as the godlye, and
Iudas aſwell as the Apoſtles.
            7. Seuenth, that yf Gods predeſtination
& purpoſe in election were certeyne
and abſolute, and God reſolued
and immutablye determined what to
do with mankynde his creature, then
ſhoulde the preachyng of repentaunce
be in vayne, becauſe the elect could neuer
myſſe heauen, nor the reprobates
eſcape hell: and ſo a great part of the
Scriptures of the holy Byble (namely
ſo much as concerned repentaunce and
godly lyuyng) ſhoulde ſerue to no purpoſe,
but to fyll vppe the booke with
wordes and leaues.
            8. Eyghth, yf God ſhoulde predeſtinate
ſome and not other ſome, electe
one & not another, geue greater grace
to one then to another: that it ſhoulde
folowe that God were not indifferent
but parciall.
            9. Nynthlie, that all and as many
aroſe agayne in Adams loynes when

Adam beleued the promyſe, as fell in
Adams loynes by the tranſgreſſion,
and that aſſone as Adam beleued they
were all reſtored to the former integritie
that Adam had before he ſinned,
and that they loſt nothyng there by but
the free acceſſe or commyng to the tree
of lyfe.
            10. Tenth, that the chyldren come
or borne of chriſten parentes, or of one
chryſten parent at the leaſt, are cleane
borne, that is to ſaye, voyde of ſynne,
both original and actuall, and therfore
a ſuperfluous worke to baptize them
in that caſe, and that they do fyrſte receiue
ſinne by the outwarde ſences, as
by hearyng, ſeeyng, and imitacion of
others.
            11. Eleuenth, that there is but one
onely grace, which is equallye and indifferently
conferred and geuen to all
men in their creation: and that al men
haue naturally the election and choyſe
of a free wyll to come to GOD when
they be called, or to refuſe, to beleue
or not to beleue, to loue and to choſe, or
to hate & refuſe, eyther good or euyll.
            12. Twelth, that all men be regenerate
before they be borne, hauyng

the ſpirite of Godde in theyr mothers
wombes, as had Iacob, Ieremye, and
Iohn Baptiſt: and the regeneration
that foloweth the naturall birth, is eyther
alway or for the moſte parte vnto
euyll: Becauſe it is wrytten in the
booke of Pſalmes. pſal. 58. Aſſone as
they are borne they goe aſtray & ſpeake
lyes. The which cannot (ſaye they) be
vnderſtand of Infantes, & of theyr naturall
byrth, who aſſone as they are
borne of their parentes, can neither go
nor ſpeake.
            13. Thirtenth, that it is to be thought
that the yonge chyldren of Turkes and
Infideles, neyther baptized nor profeſſinge
Chryſte or Chriſtian religion, yf
they die in theyr infancie, are ſaued.
            14. Fourtenth, that the luſte or concupiſcence
remayninge in the fleſhe of
men regenerate and yonge children, is
not ſinne: Becauſe that ſomtimes men
haue luſte to eate and drinke, and alſo
to do the nedefull offices of the bodye
whiche of themſelues cannot bee ſaide
to be ſynne.
            15. Fiftenth, that Ieſus Chriſt the
ſoone of god had alſo ſuch motions and
temptacions vnto euyll, as other mortal

men haue, though he conſented not,
nor gaue ouer himſelf vnto them. And
that the temptacions that he hadde in
the deſerte, and the conflicte there had
with Sathan, were altogether ſuche
inwarde motions and temptacions,
and not by any extreme or outward deuyll
as Tom painter fayneth.
            16. Sixtenth, that all Chriſtian men,
hauinge the talent, and feelinge themſelues
to be moued thereto, maye lawefully,
and alſo ought to vtter the ſame
by the waye of publique teachinge or
preachyng to others, without any further
loking for admiſſion by man. And
though that the preachinge of the Goſpell,1. Tim. 1. 1. Tim, 3.
and the adminiſtracion of the holy
Sacramentes be called an offyce, and
an ordinaunce of god in the ſcriptures:
Yet that euery man indifferently may
attēpt to do the ſame, ſo that he thinke
hymſelfe to bee moued thereto of God,Exod. 4.
and haue a mouth to ſpeake.
            17. Seuententh, that mens workes,
commentaries, and iudgementes vpon
the Scriptures ought not to bee receyued
read nor alleged in matters of religion,
but to be vtterly refuſed, becauſe

                  •
               hat menne maye, haue, and doe oftentimes

erre.
            18. Eightenth, that men godly geuen
may and do lyue in this world without
ſinne, becauſe it is wrytten: He that
ſinneth is of the deuill.1. Iohn. 3. &c. but all men
are not of the deuill, for many there are
that are borne of GOD, ergo there are
many that ſinne not. And though they
haue ſinne in them, yet committe they
none: like as a man may haue weapon
about hym though he fighte not therewith.
            19. Nintenth, though the orthodoxe
faith according to the diuine ſcriptures
doth confeſſe God to be a ſpirite without
partes, paſſions or mutabilitie, yet
ſay thei that God is verely angry, doth
repente, doth ſometymes alter and
change his purpoſe, hath a very hand,
a boſome, a ſword, a ſcabberd, a whetſtone,
bowe and arrowes, and ſuche other
lyke members and inſtrumentes.
            Theſe preſent Articles (yf thou
compare them to the aforeſayde Articles
of Pelagius) as they bee moe in
number, ſo are thei more abhominable
and diabolicall.
            But theſe and ſuch other like pernicious
errours doe they holde (good

Chriſten reader) whereof I receyued
the more part at the ſaid Hartes hand,
wrytten with hys owne fyngers at
Caunterbury. The reſidue were gathered
of theyr owne aſſertions, that
were of that ſecte, with whom, when
in the late tyme of perſecution, we dyuers
and ſundry tymes did meete, had
conference and communication thone
partie with thother, & could not agree:
becauſe that on the one part, we might
geue no place to erroure, and on the other
parte they woulde not allowe no
mannes iudgement in the matter, but
their owne, rackinge the Scriptures to
theyr owne purpoſe: I for my part ſaw
no nerer remedy, then to vſe the ſame
artillerie and weapons that thys learned
and auncient father had prepared
to our handes already, and that he vſed
to the ouerthrowynge of theyr predeceſſours,
the olde Pelagians nowe
1200. yeres paſt or therabout. Nowe
haue I ſhewed thee gentle reader, the
occaſion of thys my preſent trauayle
and enterpryſe, whiche I beſeche thee
to take in good part, wherein GOD I
take to witneſſe, I ſeeke nothynge but
that the ſincere trueth may hereby bee

knowen from errour and falſhed, that
God thereby may be glorified, and the
godly reader hereof, be edified. And as
for thoſe men agaynſte whoſe folly and
errour this worke is attempted, I hartely
deſyre of GOD the father of oure
Lorde Ieſus Chryſte, that it woulde
pleaſe hym of his infinite goodnes, to
haue mercy vppon them, and once to open
the eyes of their vnderſtandynge,
ſo that they maye ſee theyr errour and
faute, and acknowledge the ſame: and
that they may nowe at the laſte be won
vnto the pure and ſincere trueth, whervnto
they ſo longe time haue bene vtter
enemyes, that we altogether maye
be gathered into one ſhepefolde, vnder
one onely ſheepeheard Ieſus Chryſte,
whoſe holy ſpirite bee thy leader and
guyde (gentle reader) in the readynge
hereof. Amen.
            Marueyle not gentle reader I deſyre thee,
that I haue put dovvne their articles, and
haue not aunſvvered the ſame. For the
vvorke it ſelfe folovvinge doth ſufficiently
aunſvvere them, or the moſt part of them,
as thou ſhalt vvell perceiue in the
readinge of the ſame.

                  THere hath bene of
late ſeaſon, a greate
and a difficult queſtion
had in dyſputacion,
betwene the
defenders of free wyll, and the
preachers of the grace of God,

for the queſtiō is, whether god
willeth all mē to be ſaued? And
becauſe this cannot be denyed,
they demaunde why the wyl of
hym that is almyghtye is not
fulfilled? And whē that ſemeth
to come to paſſe accordynge to
the wyls of men, it ſemeth that
grace is excluded: which if it be
geuen for merites, it foloweth
that it is not a free gyfte, but a
due dette. Whereupon they demaunde
againe: why he which
wylleth al men to be ſaued, geueth
not that gyfte to all men,
without the which no man can
be ſaued? And ſo is there none
ende founde of contrary diſputacions,
whyle they diſcern not
what thing is manifeſt, & what
is hydben and not knowen.
               Therefore I wyll doe doe my diligence,
to ſearch out (ſo farre as

it ſhall pleaſe the lorde to helpe
me) with what meaſure & temperancie
men ought to iudge of
this contrarietie of opinions,
exerciſing & diicuſſing the little
meaſure of my knowleage, in
thoſe thynges which (I trowe)
haue ſticked ſoberly in my remē
                  braunce:
ſo that if the ſtyle ſhal
procede acording to thoſe rules
whiche can haue none offence

not only to our profite,
but alſo to the profite of other,
vntyl that we are come to ſome
doole or marke, beyond ye which
it ſhall not be lawfull for vs to
wade.
               I muſt then firſt of all diſpute
of the mocions and degrees of
the wyll of man. Betwene the
whith wyll & the grace of God,
ſome men make not a perfecte

diſtinction, thinkyng that thorow
the preaching of grace, free
wyl is denied: not conſidering
that by the ſame rule it may be
obiected vnto them, that they
denie grace, when they wyl not
haue it to be the guyder of mās
wyll, but the folower of it. For
if the will be taken away, wher
is then the original beginning
of true vertues? yf grace be taken
awaye, where is the verye
cauſe of good merites?
            
            
               
                  That there is in all mankynde by nature
a certeyne wyll, ſuch a one as it is.
Alſo of the deuiding of this wyll into
a naturall, reaſonable, and ſpirituall.
Alſo, although God by his diuine
prouidence, & by certaine ſpeciall
rules and lawes, had once ordered
vnto hym ſelfe a certeyne people,
choſen vnto Godlyneſſe, yet
neuertheleſſe he neuer withdrewe
from any nacion of men the gyftes
of his goodneſſe.
               
               
                  
¶The ſecond Chapter.
               
                  BVt now through the
helpe of Chriſt, I wil
enter into the matter
that I haue taken in
hande to entreate of.
There is in euery lyuyng man,
naturally a wyll (ſuch a one as
it is) in as much as it is geuen
hym to vnderſtand and to haue
experience. By the which wyll
he ether deſireth the thing that
pleaſeth hym, or refuſeth the
thing that diſpleaſeth him. Of
this wyll (as perteynyng to the
naturall motion, being weake
through the faulte of the firſte
tranſgreſſion) there are twoo
kindes: according to the which
twoo, the wyll of man is either
ſenſuall or els reaſonable. But
when the grace of god hath his
acceſſe, then, through the gifte

of the ſpirite, there is added
therto the thirde kynde, that it
myght become ſpirituall. And
by this more excellent motion,
it might diſcerne by the lawe of
heauenly wiſdome, all affectes,
whereof ſoeuer they ſprynge.
               Therfore the ſenſual will (whiche
we may alſo call the carnal
wil) is not lifted vp aboue that
motion that ſpryngeth of the
ſences of the body: Like as ther
is in the myndes of yonge chyldren,
who though they haue no
iudgement of reaſō, yet do they
ſhew plainly that thei wil ſome
thing, & nyll ſome thing, when
by ſeeing, hearyng, ſmellyng,
taſtyng or touchyng, they both
loue the thynges wherein they
delyte, & hate the thinges wherwith
thei ar diſpleſed. For what
is it to loue. but to wyll? or
what is it to hate, but to nyll?

Theſe therfore haue theyr wyl,
the which, though it be both vnable,
& alſo ignoraūt to foreſee
and to conſult, yet delighteth it
to be medlyng with thoſe thinges
that pleaſe the ſences of the
fleſhe, vntyll the tyme that the
ſtrength of a reaſonable diſcretion
be ſtirred vp in them, thorough
more riper workynge of
the body, & vntil it be moued or
applyed to the vſe of the membres,
who do ſerue them ſelues,
not by any ſtraunge mouynge,
but by theyr owne lawe. Therfore
frō this ſenſual wyll or appetite
(wherin thoſe do ſtyll remaine,
whō we ſee alſo in more
age to be diſerdes & fooles) they
aryſe vp to a reaſonable wyll:
the which before it be gouerned
by the ſpirit of god, although it
can lyfte vp it ſelfe ſomewhat
aboue the ſenſuall or carnall

motion,In this vvyll remayned the Philoſophers in times paſt & vvorldly vvyſe men in our dayes alſo. yet is it occupied but
in earthly & trāſitorie thinges,
& forgoeth not the loue of it ſelf
In this wyll alſo, mens wittes
(although they do not filthilye
ſerue the luſtes of theyr bodies,
but frame their deſires accordyng
to the lawes of Iuſtice &
honeſtie) yet obteyne they nothing
aboue the reward of a tē
                  porall
praiſe. And though they
decently garnyſhe this preſente
lyfe, yet haue they not the reward
of eternall bliſſe: for they
referre not their good deedes &
good ſtudies to the prayſe & honour
of him of whom they receiued,
that they were able in
yt reaſonable diſcretion to come
to more profounde vnderſtanding,
and to appeare more excellenter
then other men. For although
ſome mē haue bent the
entent of their vnderſtādinges,

not onelye to the learnyng of
moſt profitable artes, and doctrines
of liberall ſciences, but
alſo to the knowlege of ye moſte
hygh God, and haue beholden
the inuiſible thinges of god, by
the knowledge of thoſe thinges
which he hath made: yet foraſmuch
as thei gaue not thankes
to God, nor confeſſed him to be
the aucthour of that knowlege
and facultie, but ſayd that they
them ſelues were wyſe, that is,
they gloried not in GOD, but
in them ſelues, as though they
had attayned to the knowledge
of the truth by their owne connynge
and reaſon: they haue
come to nought in their cogitations.
And that whiche they
had founde out by the grace of
God whiche gaue them lyght,
they loſt through pride whiche
made them blynde, fallyng againe

from the heauenly light,
vnto their owne darkneſſe, that
is to wete, from the immutable
and eternal God, vnto mutable
and corruptible nature. Wherfore
when ſuch fal backe again
into the loue of them ſelues, &
in ſuche wyſe do pleaſe them
ſelues, that all thyng that they
iudge commendable in them
ſelues, they referre it not to the
gyftes of god, but do chalenge
it vnto themſelues, and aſcribe
it to the ſtudies of theyr owne
wylles: they are baniſhed farre
from the ſpirituall wyl, & haue
nothyng in them ſelues whereby
they maye be promoted to euerlaſtyng
lyfe, begynnyng in
them ſelues to corrupte alſo
thoſe temporall gyftes of god,
& to tranſlate themſelues from
theyr good vſe into the cuſtome
of innumerable vices.
               
                  
For though it be wrytten, that
when the hygheſte deuided theDeut. 32.
Nacions lyke as he diſpearſed
the childrē of Adam, he appointed
the nacions their limittes,
accordyng to the numbre of the
Angels of God, and his people
of Iacob became the portion of
the Lorde, and Iſraell the lotte
of his inheritaūce. And though
it be written that the Lord ſaid
vnto Iſraell,Leuit. 19. ye ſhalbe holy vnto
me, for I the Lord your god
am holy, which haue choſē you
for my ſelfe out of all Nacions.
And though it be writtē in the
boke of Heſter by Mardocheus,
ſaying: O Lorde we geue thee
thākes, for thou haſt done new
ſignes & wonders, ſuch as haue
not ben done among ye Heathen
deuiding al the world into two
partes, haſt choſen thy ſelfe one
part of thy people, leauing the

part to ye gentiles. And though
Paule and Barnabas ſaye,Act. 14. we
are mortall men like vnto you,
admoniſhyng you to conuert to
the liuing God, who made heauen
and earth, and the ſea, and
all thynges that are in them:
which in times paſt, ſuffred all
nacions to walke in theyr own
wayes. Although therfore that
the Scripture of veritie doeth
pronounce theſe and many like
ſayinges: yet we beleue & moſt
humbly confeſſe accordynge to
the ſame Scriptures, that the
care of Gods prouidence neuer
fayled the vniuerſal nombre of
men: who though he directed
vnto Godlineſſe by ſpeciall inſtitucions
and lawes, a certeine
people excepted to him ſelfe, yet
hath he not withdrawen the
giftes of his goodnes from any
naciō of men: That thei might

be conuinced, that thei haue receiued
the voyces of the Prophetes,
and the preceptes of the
lawe, in the obſequies and teſtimonies
of the Elementes.
Wherfore alſo thei became with
out excuſe, becauſe they made
the gyftes of God, their Gods:
and they did reuerence and worſhippe
thoſe thynges that were
created for theyr vſe. Into the
which vngodlyneſſe alſo, euen
the ſame nacion that the Lorde
had ſegregated to hym ſelfe out
of all nacions, had wholly turned
thē ſelues, had not the purpoſe
of his mercye pretended to
ſtaye the backſlydynges of his
elected. For the bookes of the
olde Teſtament are full of relacions,
of the fallynge awaye of
the people of Iſraell: that it
maye playnly appeare that the
grace of GOD was euer the

cauſe whye all that people departed
not wholly frō the lord.
On this wyſe the nature of mā
being defyled in the tranſgreſſion
of the firſt man, is euer redy
and bent to the worſe wyll, yea
euen in the middes of the benfites,
of the preceptes and aydinges
of god. Vnto the which
wyll to be committed, is nothing
els then to be geuen ouer
or let runne aſtraye.
               This wyll therefore, is waueryng,
vncertaine, vnſtable, vnexperte,
weake to brynge anye
thyng to paſſe, readye to darre
take any thyng in hande, blind
in deſires, hye mynded in honour,
doubtefull in cares, vnquiete
in ſuſpicions, more deſirous
of prayſe then of vertue,
more diligēt to get a fame then
a good conſcience, and by all experience
of it ſelfe, more miſerable

in hauynge the thynges
that it deſyreth or luſteth for,
then in beyng without them.
It hath nothynge in it owne
power, but onlye a redyneſſe to
runne in daunger: For the mutable
will that is not ruled and
gouerned by the immutable
wyll, doeth ſo much the ſooner
approche to iniquitie, as it is
more earneſtly bent to anye action.
               Wherfore ſo long as thoſe thinges
do pleaſe a man, whiche do
diſpleaſe God, his wyll is carnall.
For though he vſe good
maners, yet liueth he euyl, if he
liue not to the glory of god. For
this is a thing that is proper, &
the chiefe thynge of them that
are godly, that they glorye & reioyce
in the Lorde, & do not loue
thē ſelues but in God. For they
loue them ſelues wel, yt loue the

workes of God in them ſelues.
For God alſo loueth the thyng
in vs that he hath made, and
hateth that which he hath not
made. Therfore yf we loue the
work of God in our ſelues, then
loue we rightly a good wyll in
vs: the which, if it were not the
worke of Godde, doubtleſſe it
ought not to be loued. And
what man is it (except he be of
an euyll wyll) that loueth not
a good wyll in him ſelfe, which
is the firſt planting of the heauenly
huſbandman? For the
veritie hym ſelfe ſaith.Math. 15. Euerye
plant that my heauenly father
hath not planted, ſhalbe plucked
vppe by the rootes. What
thyng ſoeuer is not to be plucked
vp by the roote, it is manifeſt
that the ſame is planted of
the father. And a good wyll is
the fyrſte budde of all vertues:

who leaninge vppon her originall
beginninge, reſtith in the
eternall and immutable wil, to
the ende it maye be made verye
ſpirituall. For he that cleaueth
to god, is one ſpirite with hym,1. Cor. 6.
whyle through the Communion
of the geuer of lyght, and
him that is lightened, the iuſtifier
and hym that is iuſtified,
the ruler and the ſubiect, al the
action is referred vnto one, and
that that is referred vnto one,
is of both. For that cannot beer
alyenated or put awaye from
God, which he hath geuen, nor
that from man whiche he hath
receyued.
            
            
               
                  A goodly and vvittie handlynge of thys
queſtion, that is: when a man beginneth
to be of a god wil, whether
the ſame wyll be amended whiche
he had in him before: or els another
will geuē to him, which he had
not before, and the which might repugne
the fyrſt wyl. Alſo, how that
wheras in the holy Scripture, ſaluation
is generally promyſed to al
men, al men are named for ye part.
               
               
                  
¶The thirde Chapiter.
               
                  HEre it ſeemeth good
to entreate, whether
when a man begynneth
to bee of a good
will, that ſame wyll
whiche was in hym before, bee
corrected and amended, or elles
another will which he had not,
be geuen vnto him, whiche alſo
is contrary to the former wyll.
The whiche thynge ſhall not
greue me more depely to ſearch
out, to thende it may the more
euidently appeare.
               All men in the fyrſt man, are
made without fault, and al we
haue loſte the integritie, and
health of our nature, through
the tranſgreſſion of ye firſt man▪
from thence commeth mortalitie,

from thence commeth manyfolde
corruption, both of body
and ſoule, from thence commeth
ignoraunce and difficultie,
vnprofitable cares, vnlawefull
deſyres, ſacrilegious errours,
vayne feare, noyſome
loue, falſe ioyes, repentful counſailes
or deuiſes, & no leſſe miſerye,
then multitude of ſynnes.
Theſe therefore and other lyke
euils falling into the nature of
man, faith beyng loſt, hope forſaken,
vnderſtanding darkned,
the wil led captiue: no mā hath
founde ought at al in hymſelf,
wherby he myght be repayred.
For although there hath beene
ſome, whiche haue gone about
to ſtriue againſt ſinne by natural
reaſon, yet hath he garniſhed
bareinly the life of this time
onely: but hath not profited to
true vertue and eternall bliſſe.

For without the ſeruyce of the
true God,Note, euen that thinge alſo
that ſemeth to be vertue, is verie
ſinne, neyther can any man
pleaſe God, without God. And
he that pleaſeth not god, whom
doth he pleaſe but hymſelf, and
the deuil? By whom what time
man was ſpoyled, he was not
robbed of his wil, but of the integritie
and ſoundneſſe of hys
wyl: for he could not haue bene
put from the ſtate of hys innocencie,
onles he had firſt ſinned
in wil▪ That wil therfore which
was good by nature, became
euyll in qualitie, and that motion
of the mynde that can neuer
be without ſome loue, that
is to ſay, without ſome wil, loſt
not the appetite, but chaunged
the deſyre and affection, receyuinge
that by deſyre, whiche it
ought to refuſe by iudgement.
               
                  
Therfore, whan man retourneth
to godlynes, (of whom it
is for that cauſe ſpokē.Pſal 77. The ſpirite
goeth, and retourneth not
againe: for except God dyd conuert
him, he ſhuld not returne)
there is not a new worke made,
and a newe creature, nor another
ſubſtaunce created in him,
but the ſame that was decayed
is repaired: neither is there anithinge
taken from him, but the
fault whiche nature had not.
For nature in Adam was without
fault, who through diſobedience
of wyll, drewe vnto hym
many euilles, and powred forth
the ſame vpon hys poſterities,
to be multiplyed and increaſed
more & more. The which euils,
nothing can ouercome & bryng
to nothing, but the onely grace
of the Sauiour, who repaireth
his worke, with his worke: As

the Apoſtle ſaint Iohn ſayeth.1. Iohn. 3.
For thys cauſe appeared the
ſonne of God, that he might deſtroy
the workes of the deuyll.
And lyke as he breaketh the
bondes of the captiue, ſo doeth
he cloth the nakedneſſe of hym
that is ſpoyled, ſo healeth he alſo
the woundes of hym that is
wounded, that what ſoeuer he
doth in him, maye alſo be done
by hym. To whom it is not expedient
to haue conflict or kepe
battayle agaynſte hys enemye,
without a defender. For he muſt
fyght with hym of whom he
was ſomtime ouercome, wherfore
let hym not truſte to hys
owne powers, who when they
were euen perfect, ſtode not ſted
faſtly: but let him ſeeke victory
in him, which only is not ouercome
and hath gotten the vyctorie
in all thynges. And yf he

ſeeke, lette hym not doubt, but
that he hath receaued the deſire
to ſeke, of him whom he ſeketh.
Neither let him thinke, becauſe
it is done by the ſpirite of God,
that therefore he hath not free
wyll, whiche he dyd not then
looſe,The free vvill of mā is not taken avvay by Adams tranſgreſſion, but is depraued, ſo that vvith out grace it vvilleth nothynge but euill. Iere. 31. when in wyll he gaue
himſelfe to the deuyl, of whom,
the iudgment of the wyll was
depraued or corrupted, not takē
away. Wherfore that which
was not ſlayne by the wounder,
is not taken awaye by the
healer: The wounde is healed,
but nature is not put awaye.
But that that peryſhed in nature,
is not reſtored but by the
aucthour of nature. The Lorde
ſayeth, I wyll geue vnto the
houſe of Iſraell, and vnto
the houſe of Iuda, a newe Teſtamente:
not lyke vnto the

Teſtament that I gaue vnto
their fathers, in the day when
I toke thē by the hand to leade
them out of the lande of Egipt:
for they contynued not in my
teſtament, and I regarded them
not, ſayth the lorde, but thys is
the teſtament that I wyll geue
to ye houſe of Iſrael after thoſe
dayes, ſayth the Lorde, I wyll
make them to vnderſtande my
lawes, and I wyll wryte them
in their heartes, and I wyll be
theyr God, and they ſhall be my
people: and no man ſhal teache
hys neighbour, nor euery man
hys brother, ſaying, knowe the
lorde, for al men ſhal know me,
from the leaſt to the moſt, for I
wil haue mercy on their iniquities,
& will not remember their
ſinnes. And I wyll geue them
another meaning, and another
heart, that they maye feare me

all the dayes of theyr lyfe, to do
them good, and their chyldren
after them. And I wyll geue
the man euerlaſting teſtament,
whiche I wyll not take from
them. And I wyll put my feare
into their hartes, leſt thei ſhuld
go from me, and I wyll vyſite
them, that I maye make them
good.
               The lorde alſo by the prophete
Eſayas foreſheweth the ſameEſay. 43.
thynges of hys grace, by the
whiche he maketh of all men a
newe creature, ſaying: beholde
I wyll make newe thynges,
whiche nowe ſhall ryſe vp, and
ye ſhal knowe them, and I wyl
make a way in the deſert, and
ryuers in the drye lande. The
beaſtes of the fielde ſhall bleſſe
me, the maremaides & ye ſchrich
owles byrdes, becauſe I haue
geuen water in the deſert, and

ryuers in the drye grounde, to
geue drinke to myne elect generation,
mi people which I haue
purchaſed to my ſelfe, that they
maye declare my power.Eſay. 46. And agayne,
I ſweare by my ſelfe,
that there ſhal righteouſnes go
out of my mouth, & my wordes
ſhall not bee tourned backe, for
euerye knee ſhall bowe to me,
and euerye tounge ſhall prayſe
God. Therfore, yf it be impoſſible
for theſe things not to come
to paſſe, for becauſe ye foreknowledge
of God is not vncertaine,Note.
nor his counſaile mutable, neither
his wil without effect, nor
yet his promiſe falſe, all they of
whom theſe words are ſpoken,
be ſaued without exception of
any man: For he maketh them
to vnderſtande hys lawes, and
wryteth them in theyr heartes
with hys owne fynger, that

they maye receaue the knowledge
of God, not by the worke
of humayne doctryne, but by
the enformation of the hygheſt
teacher. For he that planteth
and he that watereth are nothinge,
but god that geueth the
encreaſe.1. Cor. 3. All they from the leaſt
to the moſte knowe God, for
they haue heard, and learned of
the father, that they might cōe
to Chriſte, all they beynge drawen
out of errour, are inſtructed
in the waye of lyfe. It is
geuen to al them to vnderſtand
the thynges that are ryght, and
to wyll ryghte thynges, theyr
heartes beynge chaunged.
               The feare of GOD is graffed
in all them, that they myghte
be learned in Gods commaundementes.
There is a way made
in their deſert, & their dry lande
is watred with fluds, ſo yt they

which afore dyd not open theyr
mouthes to praiſe God, and became
wylde, as the dombe and
vnreaſonable beaſtes: beynge
clenſed in the foūtaines of gods
woorde, they bleſſe and prayſe
God, declarynge the power and
maruayles of his mercy, which
hath elected them, and adopted
them into hys ſonnes, & made
them the enheritoures of the
newe teſtament. And yf (as the
Apoſtle ſaith) no man deſpiſeth
or altereth the teſtament of a
man, whē it is once confirmed,
howe can it then come to paſſe,
that the promyſe of God maye
in any parte bee reſolued? The
promyſe of God made vnto Abraham
without conditiō, and
gaue without the lawe, remayneth
ſtedfaſt, and is daily fulfilled.
For notwithſtandinge that
ſome to whom theſe thynges

bee preached, beleue not, yet
their vnbeleife hath not made
fruſtrate the truth of God.Rom. 3. For
God is true, but euery man is
a lyer. And they whiche haue
hearde the Goſpell and woulde
not beleue, are more without
excuſe, thē if thei had not heard
any preaching of the truth: but
ſure it is,Note. that in the preſence of
God they were not the children
of Abraham, nor nombred amonge
the companye of them,
of whom it is ſayd: all nations
of the earth ſhalbe bleſſed in thi
ſeede. For he promiſed that thei
ſhoulde beleue, that ſayde: And
euery one ſhall not teache hys
neighbour, and euery man hys
brother, ſaying: know the lord,
for all ſhal knowe me, from the
leaſt of them to the greateſt. He
promyſed that they ſhoulde bee
reconciled, which ſayde: I wyll

haue merci on theyr iniquities▪
and wyll not remember theyr
ſynnes. He promyſed that they
ſhoulde obey, whiche ſayde. I
wyll geue them another waye,
and another heart, that they
maye feare me all theyr dayes.
He promyſed that they ſhoulde
perſeuer and continue, whiche
ſayde: I will put my feare into
theyr heartes, leaſt they ſhould
depart from me, & I wyll viſite
thē to make them good. Alſo he
promiſed yt they ſhall al folowe
hym without exception, which
ſayd: I ſweare bi my ſelf, except
ryghteouſnes ſhal go out of my
mouth, & my wordes ſhal not be
refuſed, for euery knee ſhal bow
vnto me, and euery tounge ſhal
praiſe God. Here, if we ſay that
that thinge is not done, which
God ſware ſhoulde be done, we
aſcribe falſhed vnto God (the

whiche thynge God fordid) and
a leaſing to the truth. But if ſo
be that the woordes of God do
not faile, nor be without effect,
(as both godlynes & fayth doth
teache vs) and alſo that ſurely
done that he appoynted to bee
done, howe ſhall the ſtedfaſtnes
of the ſure promyſe appeare
vnto vs, when yet many thouſandes
of men ſerue Deuylles,
and bowe their knees to ymages?
Except we knowe yt thoſe
wordes & ſpeakinges of god be
ſpoken & ſet forth accordyng to
the immutable knowledge of
god, wherin with hym, ye generalitie
of men is now deuyded,
& whether he ſpeake of the good
men or of the euyl men, he doth
on ſuch wiſe make mention on
ye one part, as though he omytted
no man. For when the Apoſtle
ſayth: olde thinges are paſt,

beholde all thynges are made
newe: doth it not ſeeme that he
ſayde all men were renewed?
Or when he ſayeth:Coloſſ. i. for it was
his pleaſure that in him ſhould
all fulnes dwell, and by hym to
reconcile al thinges to himſelf:
doth he not ſo ſpeake as though
he would no man to bee without
reconſiliation? Or when he
ſayeth.Hebre. 1. In theſe laſte dayes he
hath ſpoken to vs in his ſonne,
whom he hath made heire of al
thynges? doeth the forme of the
ſentēce ſound any other thing,
then that all men are tranſcribed
of the father into the herytage
of Chryſte, accordinge to
the prophecie of Dauid, ſaying.
Deſyre of me,pſalm. 2. and I wyll geue
thee the heathen vnto thine herytage:
and the endes of the
earth for thy poſſeſſion. For the
Lorde ſayeth, yf I ſhall be exalted

from the earth,Iohn, 12. I wyl draw
al thinges vnto me: Doeth not
the conuerſion of all men ſeme
here to be promiſed? Or when
it is propheſied of the Churche
and ſayde:Eſay. 40. Euery valley ſhalbe
fylled, and euery mountayne
and hyll ſhalbe brought lowe,
& crooked thynges ſhalbe made
ſtrayght, & rough places made
playne. Semeth any man here
to be omitted, which is not ſignified
to become ſubiecte vnto
Chriſt? What when it is ſayde:
And all fleſhe ſhall come in my
ſyght,Eſay. 66. or before me, that they
maye worſhyp in Iheruſalem,
ſaith the Lorde?Act. 2. Ioel. 2. Pſal. 144. Or this: And
it ſhall come to paſſe in the latter
dayes, that I wyl poure out
of my ſpirite vpon al fleſhe? Or
this: The Lorde lyfteth vp all
thoſe that fall, and healeth all
them that are hurte? Is it not

ſo ſpoken, as thoughe no man
were ſecluded from that gyfte?
The people of GOD therefore
hath his fulneſſe. And though
the moſt part of men do eyther
repell, or neglecte the grace of
ſaluacion, yet in the electe and
foreknowen men,Note that here are. 2 als, namely a general all, and a ſpeciall▪ all▪
                   and amonge
them whiche are deuided from
the generalitie of all, is there a
certayne vniuerſalitie numbred:
So that out of all the
worlde, all the worlde may appeare
to be deliuered, and out
of all men, all men to be receiued.
Lyke as alſo when he ſpeketh
of the vngodly, the diuine
ſtyle ſo frameth the ſpeach, that
thoſe thinges which are ſpoken
of a certeyne part, ſeeme to apperteyne
to all men: as is this
which Iohn Baptiſt ſaieth. He
that cōmeth downe from heauen,
is aboue all men, he teſtifieth

that that he hath ſeene &
hearde,Iohn. 3. and no man receiueth
his teſtimonie. Or this ſaying
of the Apoſtle:Phil. 3. All men ſeeke
theyr owne, & not the thynges
yt are Ieſus Chriſtes,Pſalm. 13 Or yt that
Dauids pſalme ſingeth. The
Lorde loked downe from heauen
vppon the children of men,
to ſee if there were any that did
vnderſtande or ſeeke after God,
but they are all gone out of the
way, they are altogether becom
vnprofitable, there is not one
of them that doeth good, no not
one. Of theſe and ſuche documentes,
which may aboūdantly
be brought forth and aleaged
yf a man wyll ſeeke for them, it
is moſt playnely declared, that
ſomtime, for a part of the earth
all the earth, for a parte of the
worlde all the worlde, and for a
part of men al men are named.

The diuiſion wherof, notwithſtandyng,
the Scripture doeth
many times open incontinent,
that the vnderſtandynge of the
reader may be tranſferred from
the namyng of the vniuerſalitie
to that part which is therby
vnderſtanden. As is this ſaying
of the Apoſtle: We preache
Ieſus Chriſt crucified, a ſtumbling
ſtone to the Iewes,1, Cor, 1. and
vnto the Gentiles foolyſhneſſe:
But vnto thoſe Iewes and
Greekes yt are called, we preach
Chriſt the power of god and the
wyſedome of God. Is Chryſte
power to them to whom he is a
ſtumblynge blocke? Or is he
wyſedome to them to whom he
is foolyſhneſſe? No, but becauſe
ſome of them ſhalbe iuſtified by
faith, and ſome obdurate and
hardened through theyr owne
vngodlyneſſe, he hath deuided

one kynd of beleuers and vnbeleuers,
vnder the name of them
that are called, that thoſe whō
he ſignified to be without faith
he might ſhew to be none of the
numbre of them that are called,
though they had heard the
Goſpell. By this rule the word
of God doeth promiſe by Eſai,
ſaying.Eſay. 42. I wyll leade foorth the
blind men into a way that they
knowe not, & they ſhall walke
the pathes that they wote not,
I wyll make darkeneſſe to bee
lyght vnto them, and crooked
wayes ſtreyght. Theſe wordes
wyll I doe, and I wyll not forſake
them. But that which foloweth
(And they are tourned
backwarde) muſt be referred to
a certeyne part of them, not vnto
them to whō it is ſaid: I wyl
not forſake them.Eſay. 43. The Lorde
ſaieth agayne to Iacob. Be not

afrayde, for I am with thee:
From the Eaſt wyl I bring thy
ſeede, and gather thee from the
Weſte. I wyll ſay to the North,
bryng hyther: & to the South,
forbydde thou not. Brynge my
ſonnes frō a farre coūtrie, and
my doughters frō the worldes
end. All thoſe in whō my name
is called, I haue prepared them
vnto my glory, & I haue faſcioned
& made them. But that ye foloweth:
I haue brought forth a
blynde people, & theyr eyes are
blynde, & they haue deafe eares,
can not by any reaſon agree to
them, whom he ſayeth he hath
prepared vnto his glory. In all
theſe wordes which are ſpoken
of one kynde of men, the former
wordes do agree to ſome, & the
latter wordes to other ſome.
And as the ſaying of ye Apoſtle
is: that thyng that is done in

parte of the people, is declared
vnder the name of all people, &
in the remnaunt is the fulneſſe
counted. For when he diſputed
of the obſecation & blinding of
the Iewes, & ſhewed that ſome
of them were ſaued by grace: I
ſay therfore (ſaith he) hath God
repelled his people? God forbid.
For I alſo am an Iſraelite, of ye
ſeede of Abraham, of the tribe
of Beniamin, GOD hath not
caſt a waye his people whom heRom. 11.
knew before. Therfore the people
that was foreknowen, the
people yt is not repelled, are thei
whiche are iuſtified in Chriſte.
And yt which ſemeth to be ſpokē
of al Iſraell, is ſhewed in them
only whom the electiō of grace
hath made a remnaunt to hym
ſelfe: Lyke as the conſequens
of the Apoſtles wordes do declare,
for he doeth adde and ſay.

Do ye not know what the ſcripture
ſaith of Helyas, howe he
prayeth vnto God agaynſte Iſraell?
O Lord they haue ſlaine
thy Prophetes, they haue dygged
downe thine Altares, and
I am left alone, and they ſeeke
my lyfe. But what ſaith the
aunſwer of God to him? I haue
reſerued vnto my ſelfe ſeuen
thouſand men, which haue not
bowed the knee to Baall. So
therfore (ſaith he) in this tyme
alſo, is there a remnaunt ſaued
by the election of grace. And yf
it be of grace, thē is it not now
of workes, for then were grace
no grace. Therfore, all Iſraell
is not reprobate, neyther is all
elected: But wyllyng blindnes
hath tourned away a part, and
free illuminaciō hath reſerued
a parte vnto him ſelfe. And yet
are the wordes ſpoken of them

on ſuch ſorte, that no difference
ſeemeth to be made of all mankynde,
neyther of them that peryſhe,
nor of them that are ſaued.
For when it is read, as touching
the Goſpell, they are enemies
for your ſake: but as touchyng
theyr election, they are
beloued for the fathers ſake: the
wordes ſo ſounde, as though he
called them beloued, whom he
called enemies. But the Apoſtle
hym ſelfe wypeth awaye this
darkeneſſe, ſaying: For blyndneſſe
is happened vnto parte of
Iſraell, that we myght vnderſtande
one generacion to be deuided
into two kyndes: and all
men, all fulneſſe, all Iſraell,
not alway to be referred to the
vniuerſalitie, but many tymes
to a part. Among theſe maner
of ſpeaches, we ought alſo to
note this ſaying in the Scriptures,

wherin that which perteyneth
to men of diuers times
is promiſed on ſuche wyſe, as
though it were ſpoken of one
generation of the ſame tyme.
Lyke as is that which the Apoſtle
Peter, wrytyng to them of
his tyme & of the tyme to come,
ſayeth:1. pet. 2. But ye are an elect generacion,
a kingly prieſthod, an
holye nacion, a purchaſed people,
that ye myght ſhewe the
vertues of him that hath called
you out of darkeneſſe, into his
marueylous lyght, which ſomtyme
were not a people, but
now are ye people of god, which
hadde not obteyned mercy, but
nowe haue obteyned mercye.
When theſe thinges were preached:
whether did thoſe men yet
remaine, whō God in time paſt
ſuffred to walke in theyr owne
waies? And thoſe ſame mē that

were deliuered vp to their own
willes: were they now called into
that marueilous light? were
not they now dead? They were
not now in this world, neither
did their retourne from errour
to veritie helpe thē at al which
were dead before. And yet the
cuſtome of ſpeach hath declared
that after long time, grace was
in the poſteritie of the wicked:
that they may appeere nowe to
be elected, which afore were for
ſakē. Theſe ſayinges do not belong
to ye ſame men, but to men
of the ſame nacion. And the vocation
or calling that hath ſhyned
nyghe vnto the ende of the
world, hath not recourſe to the
tyme paſte. So nowe, by a certeyne
maner, it are both they,
and not they, of whom and to
whom theſe thynges are ſpoken:
whyle, when they are not

deuided in any ſpecialitie from
a generalitie, yet are they deuided
in ſome thinges frō a Communitie.
            
            
               
                  A ſolucion of the contentious obiectior
ſome, which ſay this aucthor by
his former wordes gaynſayeth the
Apoſtle, who diffineth that GOD
wylleth all men to be ſaued, and to
come to the knowlege of the truth.
Alſo that the depth of Gods miſteries
and iudgementes are not to be
ſearched of vs.
               
               ¶The fourth Chapter.
               
                  BVt whē they that
loue contencious
quarrellyng ſhall
rede or heare theſe
thinges, they wyl
ſaye yt we by theſe
diſputacions do ſpeake agaynſt
the Apoſtle, which ſayeth that
God wylleth all men to be ſaued,

and to come to the knowledge
of the trueth. The which
part of the Apoſtles wordes, we
ſo fully and wholly do receiue,
that we withdrawe nothynge
frō it of that that goeth before
or commeth after, that perteyneth
therto. For (that we maye
ſet aſyde other teſtimonies of
the Scriptures of God) this
place is ſufficient to refell that
that they falſely obiecte, and to
defende that, that they wickedly
denye. The Apoſtle Paule
wrytynge on this wyſe to Timothie,
ſayeth: I exhorte you
therfore that there be prayers,
ſupplications, and thankeſgeuynge,
made for all menne, for
kynges, and for all them that
be in aucthoritie, that we may
leade a peaceable and a quiete
lyfe, in all godlyneſſe and purenes,
for that is good and accepted

in the ſight of God our Sauiour,
which wylleth all men
to be ſaued, and to come to the
knowledge of the trueth. For
there is one God, and one mediatour
betwene God and men,
euen the man Ieſus Chryſte,
whiche hath geuen hym ſelfe a
raunſome for all men. Of this
rule therefore of the Apoſtles
doctrine, wherwith the vniuerſall
Churche is inſtructed, leaſt
we ſhuld wander into a ſtrange
vnderſtandyng after our owne
brayne, let vs ſearche what the
vniuerſall Churche vnderſtandeth
in it: for there can be nothyng
doubtfull in the precept,
yf that the obedience in the deſyre
do agree. Therefore the Apoſtle
commaunded, yea rather
the Lorde by the Apoſtle, which
ſpake in the Apoſtle, that prayers,
ſupplications, & thankeſgeuyng

ſhoulde be made for all
menne, for kynges, and for all
thē that are conſtitute in aucthoritie.
The whiche lawe of
ſupplication and praier, the deuocion
of all prieſtes, and of all
faythfull men doth ſo agreably
holde, that there is no parte of
the worlde wherein ſuche prayers
are not celebrate and made
of the Chriſtian people. The
Churche therefore in euerye
place, prayeth vnto God, not
only for the Saintes and them
that are alreadye regenerate in
Chriſt: but alſo for al Infidels
and ennemies of the Croſſe of
Chriſt, for all Idolaters, for all
them that perſecute Chriſte in
his membres, for the Iewes, vnto
whoſe blyndeneſſe the lyght
of the Goſpell ſhyneth not,
for Heretickes and Sciſmatickes,
whiche are without the

vnitie of faith and charitie.
               And what doeth the Churche
aſke for theſe, but that they forſakyng
theyr errours maye be
conuerted vnto God, maye receiue
faith, maye receiue charitie:
and being deliuered from
the darkneſſe of ignorance, thei
myght come to the knowledge
of the trueth? The which thinges
becauſe thei are not able to
geue it to them ſelues, being ſo
oppreſſed & wayed downe with
the wayght of euyll cuſtome,
and tayed in the bondes of the
deuyll, neither are able to ouercome
the thynges that deceiue
them: Wherein they haue ſtycked
ſo faſt, that loke how much
the trueth ought to be beloued,
ſo much do they loue falſehod.
It is the wyll of the mercifull
and iuſt Lorde to be prayed vnto
for all menne, that when

we ſee innumerable to be delyuered
from ſuche bottomleſſe
miſcheifes, we ſhuld not doubt
but that GOD hath graunted
that, that he was deſyred to
graunt: And that we geuynge
thankes for them that are ſaued,
ſhould hope alſo, that they
whiche are not yet illumined,
ſhalbe delyuered by the ſame
helpe of Goddes grace from the
power of darkeneſſe, that they
may be trāſlated into the kingdome
of god, or euer thei depart
out of this life. But if any man
fayle of this grace of the Sauioure
(as we ſee it doth happen)
and the prayer of the Churche
bee not receyued for them, we
muſte referre it to the ſecrete
iudgementes of Goddes righteouſnes,
and we muſte acknowledge,
that the depeneſſe of thys
miſterie cannot appeare to vs

in thys life. For our knowledge
is vnperfect, and our propheciyng
vnperfect. And we ſee now
as it were by a glaſſe in a darke
ryddell, neyther are we wyſer,
or haue more knowledge
then the bleſſed Apoſtle, who
when he dyſputed of the grace
of GOD, and was entred into
the ſecrete of great miſteries,
he fell downe vnder thoſe thinges
that was vnpoſſible to bee
declared. For when he had ſaid,
brethren I would not haue you
ignoraunt of this miſterie, leſt
ye ſhould be wiſe in your owne
conceypt, that blindnes is happened
in part of Iſraell, tyl the
fulneſſe of the gentilles myght
enter in, and ſo al Iſrael might
bee ſaued, as it is wrytten. He
ſhall come out of Syon, which
ſhall tourne away vngodlynes
out of Iacob, and thys is the

teſtamente that I wyll geue
them, that I wyll take awaye
their ſinnes. For as concerning
the Goſpell, they are enemyes
for your ſake: but concernynge
election, they are beloued for
the fathers ſake: for the giftes
and calling of god, are without
repentaunce. For lyke as ye
ſometyme alſo dyd not beleue
in God,In your mercy, that is in the mercy that ye haue obtayned. and nowe haue obtayned
mercy, becauſe of theyr vnbeliefe:
euen ſo they alſo haue
not nowe beleued in your mercye,
that they myght obtayne
mercy: For GOD hath ſhutte
vppe all in vnbeliefe, that he
myght haue mercy on all.
               Therefore, when in a certayne
traunce or receſſe of his mynde,
he had powred foorth theſe miſteries
of Goddes workes, farre
paſſynge the meaſure of mans
vnderſtandynge, he tourned

all the reaſon of the expoſition
therof into a wonder, and meruayling
greatly at the thynges
whiche he had ſpoken, he cryed
out and ſayde: Oh the depth of
the wiſdome and knowledge of
GOD, how incomprehenſible
are hys iudgementes, and hys
wayes paſte fyndynge out? for
who hath knowē the meanyng
of the Lorde? or who hath bene
of his counſayle? Or who gaue
fyrſt vnto hym, and he ſhall rewarde
hym? For of hym, and by
him, and in him, are al thyngs.
To hym be glory for euermore.
Amen.
            
            
               
                  VVhy all nations in tyme paſte vvere
ſuffred to walke theyr own wayes,
one Iſraell onely excepted, and vnto
the knowledge of the trueth elected,
and why God geueth grace to
one man, and denieth it to another.
               
               ¶The fifth Chapiter.
               
                  
                  THe aſſertion of hym
that teacheth the
thynges afore ſpoken,
wyll miniſter
occaſion of manye
queſtions. As it is demaunded,
what the cauſe ſhoulde be, that
Goddes grace was ſo variated
through oute ſo many peoples
and tymes: that is to ſay, why
all nations in tyme paſte were
ſuffred to walke in their owne
wayes, one Iſrael only (which
was inſtructed by the woorde)
excepted, and elected to knowe
the trueth, whoſe infidelitie at
the laſt miniſtred occaſion, and
gaue place to the ſaluation of
the gentiles, as and if thys one
people did abyde in the fayth of
his forefathers, the mercye of
god could not be geuen to other
nations? Alſo why they, whoſe
diminiſhing is the ſaluation of

the gentils, are not fyrſt deliuered
from theyr blyndnes, before
the fulnes of the gētilles ſhuld
come in, as though they coulde
not be illumined with all men,
whiche ſhalbe all ſaued after
that the adoption of the gentils
ſhalbe once finiſhed? Or howe
all Iſraell ſhalbe ſaued, when
theyr obſecation and blindneſſe
is taken a way, of whom an innumerable
multitude are fallen
awaye in theyr infidelitie,
and haue not come to the tyme
wherein they are promyſed to
be ſaued? Or howe the fulneſſe
of thoſe nations, (whiche were
not called before) are ſayde to
enter in nowe, when of euerye
age & condiciō of men, ſo many
thouſandes of all nations vnder
heauen, do dye without beynge
iuſtified in Chryſte? But
the godly and wiſe teacher had

leuer ſuſpende the cauſes of
theſe ſecretes and iudgmentes
vnto the profoūditie and depth
of the ryches of Goddes wyſedome
and knowledge, then
with raſhe inquiſition to dyſcuſſe
the miſterie of the moſte
iuſte veritie and moſte mercyfull
goodneſſe, whiche is taken
awaye from the knowledge of
man, omittinge none of thoſe
thynges which it behoueth mē
to knowe, and medlynge not at
all with thoſe thynges whiche
are not laweful to be knowen.
For there are manye thynges
in the diſpenſatiō and ordering
of Gods workes, whoſe effectes
only are ſhewed, but the cauſes
lye hydde, that when it doeth
appeare what is done, yet it
appeareth not why it is done,
that where as the worke is ſene
of all men, yet the reaſon why

it was done, is ſhutte vp in ſecrete,
to thende that in all one
and the ſelfe ſame thyng, both
preſumption in thynges vnſercheable
might be holden vnder,
& alſo that faiſhed of manifeſte
thinges might be confuted. For
though I knowe not why one
man was created a Greeke, another
a Barbarian: this man
borne in richeſſe, and he in pouertie:
one man the valiaunt
beautie of a perſonable ſtature
doth ſette foorth, another, the
croked deformitie of feble membres
doth diſfigure: this man
begotten of Chriſten parentes
was noriſhed in the cradell of
veritie, another, beynge the
broode of heretickes drynketh
the poyſon of errour with the
milke of his mother. And to be
briefe, although I can not diſcuſſe
a thouſand other differences

in the habite of bodies, in
the qualities of myndes, the
condicion of times, the maners
of countryes: yet foloweth it
not therof that I am ignorant
that God is the maker and the
diſpoſer of all theſe thinges,
who verely hath on ſuche wyſe
created the bodies and ſpirites
of all men, that beſides the voluntarye
or wylfull diuerſitie
that foloweth the ſtudie of euery
man, he variated them in
moſt vnlyke number in the beginning
of their creation.
               The manye opinions of vayne
bablers would trouble vs, and
drawe vs diuers wayes, which
out of thynges vnable to bee
knowen, haue preſumed to goe
into inconueniences, and haue
aſcribed theſe original inequalities
and differences, vnto fate
or deſtinies (when in dede there

are none at all) and vnto planettes
or ſtarres: onleſſe we dyd
holde in moſte ſure knowledge,
that God the creatour hath formed
of the natural Elementes
euery veſſel as he wyl, and hath
ordered one nature of ſoules,
and one nature of bodyes by
meaſures after hys owne pleaſure,
whiche workes of GOD
might alſo be knowen to mans
vnderſtandynge, yf they ought
to be knowen, and it myght be
ſhewed why euery thynge was
ſo made, but that it is ſufficient
to knowe, that they were ſo
made.
               The Lord ſaith vnto Moſes:
who hath geuen man a mouth?Exod▪ 4.
who hath made the dombe and
the deafe, the ſeynge and the
blynde? haue not I the Lorde
God?
               And by the Prophete Eſay he

ſaith:Eſay. 66. Haue not I made the
fruitefull & the barreyne, ſaith
the Lord? It is red in the boke
Eccleſiaſticus:Eccle. 11. good and euyll,
lyfe aud death, pouertie and richeſſe,

ſaith? The dwellyng houſes of
robbers and brybers are full of
plentifull ſtore, & yet dare they
boldly prouoke GOD, whereas
he hath geuen all thynges
into theyr handes.
               And the ſame Iob, diſputing
of the increaſe and decreaſe of
humaine and worldly thinges,
and referrynge all chaunges to
the iudgmentes of God, ſayth.
With hym is there wyſedome
and ſtrength, he hath counſaile
and vnderſtanding. If he pluck
downe, there is no man can
builde vp: if he cloſe vp a man,
there is no man can open hym:
yf he withholde the waters, all

ſhalbe dried vp: if he ſend them
foorth, they ſhall ouerflowe the
earth, with hym is power and
wiſdome, he knoweth both the
deceiuer and hym that is deceiued,
he bringeth counſellers
to a foolyſhe ende, and Iudges
into daſedneſſe: he looſeth the
girdle of Kynges, and gyrdeth
theyr loynes with a rope: he
maketh Prieſtes without honour,
and ouerthroweth the
rulers: he changeth the lippes
of the true ſpeakers, & taketh
awaye the learnynge of the Elders,
powrynge foorth diſpite
vpon Princes, and relieuynge
them that were oppreſſed: who
openeth the thynges that are
buryed in darknes, & bryngeth
to lyght the ſhadowe of death,
which multiplieth the naciōs,
and deſtroyeth them, and maketh
them that are deſtroyed

ſounde agayne, whiche chaungeth
the heartes of the Princes
of the earth, & beguyleth them,
that they maye goe they wote
not whyther. They grope as in
darkneſſe, and not in the light,
and he wyll make them to goe
out of the waye lyke dronken
men. And agayne, the ſame
Iob ſhewyng that the wyll of
God can not be fruſtrate,Iob. 33. ſaith:
For he is alone (ſaith he) and
no man can turne his thought,
and loke whatſoeuer his ſoule
wylleth, the ſame ſhalbe done.
Part of mankynd is deliuered,
and part of them doth peryſhe:
& if we ſhoulde aſcribe that vnto
the merites of mens wylles,
as though it ſhoulde ſeme that
grace hadde refuſed naughtie
men and choſen good men, then
ſhal the cauſes of innumerable
people reſiſt and be agaynſt vs,

vnto whom by the ſpace of ſo
many yeres, the preachynge of
the heauenly doctrine hath not
ſhone. Neither maye we ſaye
that their poſterities were better,Eſay. 9.
of whom it is written. The
people of the nacions whiche
ſate in darknes haue ſene great
light, & vnto them that ſate in
darknes and ſhadowe of death
light is ſprong vp. And they to
whom the Apoſtle Peter ſaith:1. Pet. 2.
Ye are an electe generation, a
kyngly prieſthod, an holy nacion,
a purchaſed people, that ye
myght ſhewe foorth the power
of him that hath called you frō
darkeneſſe, into his ſo marueylous
a lyght: who in time paſt
were not a people, but nowe
are the people of god: on whom
ſometime he had no mercy, but
nowe hath mercy. Wherefore,
that is not geuen for the merites

of the yonger, whiche the
elders did not deſerue. For the
vngodlynes was all alike that
accuſed the children aſwell as ye
fathers: and all one & the lyke
blindneſſe of ignoraunce drowned
and ouerwhelmed both the
one and the other in lyke error.
But what knowlege can cōprehend,
or what wiſdome cā finde
out, why God had mercy on the
one ſort, & had not mercy on the
other? The reaſon of this difference
lieth hyd & is ſecrete, but
not the difference it ſelfe. We
vnderſtande not his iudgement
herein, but we ſe his workyng.
And why then do we falſely accuſe
his ſecret iudgement, that
owe thanckes to his manifeſte
mercy? Let vs praiſe and reuerence
that that is done, for ther
is no danger to be ignoraunt of
that that lyeth hyd in ſecrete.
               
                  
Loke alſo vppon the whole
multitude of yonge children,Originall ſinne deſerueth damnation in
whom (except it bee that ſinne
onely, wherein al mankinde is
borne into dampnation) neyther
can any merites paſte, nor
yet to come, bee iudged: for all
they of whom we nowe ſpeake
of, before they haue anye vſe of
vnderſtanding, before thei haue
any free libertie of wil,Thys he ſpeaketh becauſe ſuche infantes vnbaptized, haue no promyſe in the ſcripture to be ſaued. ſome of
them beinge regenerate, do goe
into euerlaſting bliſſednes, and
other ſome not borne againe, do
paſſe vnto perpetuall miſerie.
Nowe yf thou graunteſt originall
ſinne, then is all the nomber
of them giltie, and yf thou
lokeſt on the innocencie of their
maners, the hole flocke of them
is without fault. The iuſtice of
man cannot finde ani differēce,
but the vnſpeakable grace of
God, hath founde out what to

elect. The deuice lyeth hydde in
ſecrete, but the gyfte lyeth not
hyd. Godlyneſſe bryngeth forth
the woorke, but power hydeth
the cauſe. But, as little is that
to be doubted that is not ſene,
as that that is ſene: for neither
the confeſſion of the manifeſte
worke, nor yet of the vnknowen
equitie, can be denied to the
creatour. But if thou wilte direct
the ſight of thy mynde vnto
thoſe men, who lyuynge a
long time in ſinne & miſchiefe,
are renewed and borne agayne
by the Sacrament of Chriſtian
baptiſme, euen in the ende of
their lyfe: and without anye
helpe of good workes, are tranſlated
into the felowſhip of the
heauenly kingdome. By what
reaſon wylte thou knowe the
iudgement of God therein, but
only that thou muſt knowe vndoubtedlye

that the gyftes of
God are free? And that, like as
there be no ſinnes ſo deteſtable
that they are able to withſtand
or kepe away the gyft of grace:
euen ſo can there be no workes
ſo excellent, to whom that that
is freely geuen, is due by the
iudgement of rewarde or retribucion:
for then ſhoulde the
bloudde of Chriſte be nothyng
woorth, neither ſhould the prerogatiue
of mens workes be any
thing inferiour to the grace
of God. If iuſtification which
cōmeth by grace, were due vnto
anye merites that went before:
then it were not a gyft of
a free geuer, but the wages of
a worker. And howe myght it
be proued, that there bee no
workes meete to put away originall
ſinne, onleſſe that both
vngodly men, and alſo miſcheuous

perſons, were by the lauer
of Chriſte receiued into his
kyngdome? And howe ſhoulde
they which glory in their owne
righteouſnes knowe how little
thei can do worthy of the adoption
of the ſonnes of God, yf
thei came not to the Sacramēt
of regeneration, ſeing they are
faſt tied and holden in the ſame
ſtate and condicion that the
wickedſt ſinners be? Thei ſhuld
become like in ſanctification, if
they were regenerate, but ſhuld
peryſhe together yf they were
not baptized. Therfore, if grace
haue founde anye of the moſte
wicked menne, yea euen in the
verye departynge of the lyfe,
whom it doth adopte and choſe
(when, notwithſtandynge manye
that haue leſſe offended are
ſeene to bee without this
gyfte) who can ſaye eyther

that this is done without the
diſpenſation and appointment
of God, or els that they are ſo
diſcerned and ſeuered a ſunder
without profounde and ſecrete
equitie? The which alſo is not
therefore vniuſte, becauſe it is
vnknowen: but therefore is it
iuſte, becauſe there is no doubt
but that it is the iudgement of
God. For that that dependeth
vpon his pleaſure, it is vncertayne
with what ſentence it
ought to be iudged, afore it be
iudged. But when the thynge
ſhall come to his ende, no man
ought to complayne of the end:
for it is moſt certeyne, that god
ought not to do any other wiſe
then he hath done. The rule of
the Euangelicall parable hath
alſo confirmed the varietie and
diuerſitie of the manyfolde vocation
and callyng whiche belongeth

vnto one grace: in the
whiche is declared, howe the
good man of the houſe hyred at
ſundrye tymes labourers into
his vineyarde, vnder the couenaunt
of a penye, whereby is
ſignified the equalitie of eternall
lyfe. Where no doubt, they
that were ſente into the vineyarde
at the eleuenth houre,The eleuēth hour is .v. of the clocke at aft. noon after the Ievves accompt. receiuyng
as muche as they that
had wrought al the day, doe repreſent
the nombre of thoſe of
whom I nowe ſpeake: whom
the gentleneſſe of GOD hath
eſteemed and accompted in the
ende of the day and concluſion
of their lyfe, to commende and
prayſe the excellencie of his
grace: not paying them wages
for theyr labour, but powryng
foorth the richeſſe of his goodneſſe
vpon them whom he choſe
without workes, that they alſo

which had ſwette with muche
labour, & yet receiued no more
then the laſt, might vnderſtand
that they had receiued the gyft
of his grace, not the wages of
theyr workes. Wherfore, yf we
alſo do murmure agaynſte the
good man of the houſe, becauſe
they that were laſte called are
made equal to the labourers of
the whole daye, or that they
haue deſerued no more with
theyr much labour, then the other
that laboured almoſte nothynge
at all: the ſame ſhalbe
ſayde to vs that was aunſwered
to one of them. Frende, I
do thee no wronge,Math. 20. take that
that is thine, and go thy way,
for I wyl geue as much to this
man that came laſte, as I wyl
to thee: Is it not lawefull for
me to do with mine own what
I lyſte? or els is thine eye euyll

becauſe I am good? Surely
this liberalitie ſeemed to this
falſe accuſer to be vnequall: &
what was he ye wiſer? or what
accomptes was there made vnto
hym? The ryghteouſnes of
the diſpenſation of that buſyneſſe
was not opened vnto him,
neither was he admitted to be
of counſell of this hyd ſecrete.
But that he ſhoulde refrayne
frō ſerching the iudgements of
god, ther was laide forth before
hym both the goodneſſe of hym
yt is mercifull, & alſo the power
or aucthoritie of him yt willeth
it to be ſo: euē like as if it ſhuld
haue ben ſaide vnto hym of the
Apoſtle. O man, what art thou
that diſputeſt with god?Rom. 9. Doth
the potte ſay to him that made
hym, why haſt thou made me
on this wiſe? Therfore in al mē
of euery nacion, of euery ſtate

or condicion and age, the wyll
of God is the cauſe of the receiuing
of grace in them, with the
whiche wyll, the reaſon of the
election lyeth hyd: all merites
beginning at that grace, which
thei haue receiued without merites,
whiche merites yf they
coulde be good without grace,
it ſhould not be ſayde: Excepte
a man be borne agayne of water
and of the holy ghoſt,Iohn. 3. he ſhal
not enter into the kingdome of
heauen. And, except ye eate the
fleſſhe of the ſonne of man and
drinke his bloudde, ye haue no
life in you: But it ſhuld be ſaid,
Except a man be iuſt & good, he
can not be bleſſed for euer. Neither
were it nedefull to be born
againe of water and of the ſpirite,
yf it were ſufficient to be
inſtructed by the commaundement:
and faith ſhould take no

place, whiche beleueth that all
ſinnes are forgeuen throughe
baptiſme, yf it were taught
that grace were not geuen vnto
the euyll & wicked men, but
vnto good and righteous men.
Therfore the beginning of true
lyfe and ryghteouſnes, conſiſteth
in the Sacrament of regeneration,
that where a man is
renued, there alſo the veritie of
theſe vertues ſhoulde ſpringe,
and they beginne to profyte by
fayth vnto perpetuall glorye,
who coulde ſcarſe come to the
temporall rewarde of vayne
prayſe. For whether he be a
Iewe that ſwelleth throughe
the knowledge of the lawe, or a
Greeke puffed vp throughe the
ſtudie of naturall wiſdome, before
he be iuſtified by the faith
of Chriſt, he is ſhutte vp vnder
ſinne. And yf he continue in

his infidelitie, ye wrath of God
abideth vppon him, euen that
ſame which he had drawē vnto
himſelfe in the tranſgreſſion of
Adam, wherof the Apoſtle ſpeaketh,
ſaying.Ephe. 2. And ye when ye
were dead in your treſpaſſes &

in tyme paſte, in the
luſtes of our fleſhe, & fulfylled
the wyll of the fleſhe and of the
mind, and were by nature the
chyldren of wrath, like as other
were. And agayne: ye were at
that tyme without Chryſt, aliens
from the common wealth
of Iſraell, and ſtrangers from
the Teſtamentes, hauynge no

hope of the promeſſe, and were
without God in this worlde.
And agayne: ye were ſomtime

which we haue done,
but acording to his mercy hath
he ſaued vs, through the lauer

whom he hath powred foorth
aboundantly vpon vs, through

briefly apeere what
the nature of man is
without grace,Iude. 1. lette
Iude the Apoſtle tel,
what eyther the ignoraunce of
the vnlearned, or the doctrine
of the wyſe can doe. But they
(ſaith he) what thinges ſoeuer
they knowe not, that do they
blaſpheme: and what ſoeuer
thinges they knowe naturally
(as brute beaſtes do) therin corrupt
they them ſelues. Let alſo

the Euangeliſt Luke,Luke. 1. vnder the
wordes of zacharie, tel in what
a nyght mankynde doth wander
before the illuminacion of
grace, and out of what a darkneſſe
of ignoraunce the people
of God is deliuered. And thou
childe (ſaith he) ſhalt be called
the prophete of the hygheſt, for
thou ſhalt go before the face of
the Lord to prepare his wayes.
To geue knowledge of ſaluacion
to his people, for the remiſſion
of theyr ſinnes. Through
the tender mercye of our God,
whereby the daye ſpryng from
an hyghe, hath viſited vs. To
geue light to them that ſitte in
darkeneſſe & in the ſhadowe of
death, & to guide our feete into
the way of peace. And this tender
mercy hath the lord ſhewed,
not to the redemption of one
people onely, but vnto the ſaluacion

of all Nacions, as the
Euangeliſte ſaith: For Ieſus
muſt dye for the people,Ioh, 11. and not
for the people onely, but alſo
that he myght gather together
the children of god which were
diſperſed. And that thing doth
the voyce of the Lorde, whiche
throughe the trumpe of godlynes
ſoundynge throughout all
the worlde, doth both call and
gather together al mē.Math. 11. For whē
he had ſaid: I thank thee oh father,
lord of heauen and earth,
becauſe thou haſte hydde theſe
thinges frō the wiſe & prudent,
& haſte reueled thē vnto babes:
Euen ſo O father, for ſo was it
thy good pleaſure: he added. All
thinges are geuen to me of my
father, & no man hath knowen
the ſonne but ye father, neyther
hath any man knowen the father,
but the ſonne, & he to whō
                  
the ſonne wyll reuele him. And
thē he added: Come vnto me all
ye ye labour, & are laden, and I
wyl refreſh you. Take my yoke
vpon you, & learne of me, for I
am meke and humble of harte,
and ye ſhal finde reſt vnto your
ſoules, for my yoke is ſweete &
my burden is light. Iohn Baptiſt
alſo in the Goſpel of Iohn,
proteſteth in ye ſpirit of propheſie,
ſaying:Ioh. 3. He yt came frō heauē
is aboue al mē, & he doth teſtify
that ye he hath ſene & hard, and
no man receiueth his witneſſe,
howbeit he yt receiueth his witnes
hath ſet his ſeale that God
is true. Therfore in ſomuch as
perteineth to ye blindnes of mā
                  kind,
gotten with ye long night
of ignorance & pride, the creator
of ye world, came into this world
& the world knew him not, the
lyght ſhyned in the darkneſſe,

but the darkeneſſe comprehended
it not. He that is aboue all
teſtified that that he had ſeene
and hard, and no man receaued
his teſtimonie. But becauſe the
ſonne of God came not in vain
into the worlde, but gaue hym
ſelfe for all men: he dyed, not
onely for the people, but alſo
that he myght gather into one
the children of God which were
diſperſed. And he ſaid vnto all
men: Come vnto me all ye that
labour and are laden, & I ſhall
refreſhe you. And he maketh
him ſelfe and his father knowen
to whom he wyll reuele it,
reſeruing vnto him ſelfe the libertie
of the election vnable to
be knowen. All the chyldren of
lyght, the chyldren of promeſſe,
the ſonnes of Abraham, the
ſonnes of God, the electe generation,
the kyngly prieſthood,

the true Iſraelites, foreknowen
and fore ordeyned to the
kingdome of god (who hath called
them, not onely out of the
Iewes, but alſo out of the gentiles)
do receyue the teſtimonie
of hym that came downe from
heauen, and ſette theyr ſeales
that God is true, that is to ſay:
they declare in that thei are ſaued,
that GOD is true, that he
kepeth touch and perfourmeth
that, that he promyſed vnto Abraham
the father of all nations.
Who when God promyſed
him that he ſhould be the heyre
of the worlde, doubted not by
miſtruſt: But beinge comforted
in faith, gaue glory vnto God,
knowing moſte certainely, that
he was able to perfourme the
thynge that he had promyſed.
And who is ſo enſtraūged from
the fayth of Abraham? who is

ſo farre growen out of kynde
from the father of all nations,
that he will ſay eyther that the
promyſe of god is not fulfilled,
or els that it is fulfilled of any
other then of hym that made
that promiſe? Truely, that man
ſhall be a lyer, but god ſhall be
true. And euery one that receyueth
his teſtimony, ſealeth this
thinge, ſheweth thys thynge.
That he is made to ſee, by that
light which geueth lyght, he is
made obedient, he is made to
vnderſtande, as the Euangeliſt
Iohn wytneſſeth, ſayinge. We
knowe that al the worlde is ſet
on wickednes, and we knowe
that the ſonne of God is come,
and hath geuen vs an vnderſtanding
that we myght know
the true God, and ſhoulde be in
hys true ſonne.
            
            
               
               
                  VVhy he that is the Sauioure of al men
hath not geuen to all men this vnderſtanding
that they might know
the true god. Alſo why ſome yonge
Chyldren beynge regenerate, are
ſaued, and other ſome, not beynge
regenerate, do periſhe and are loſt.
               
               ¶The ſeuenth Chapiter.
               
                  BVt yf they aſke, why
the Sauioure of all
men gaue not thys
vnderſtanding to all
men, that thei might
knowe the true God, and that
they might bee, that is to ſay:
myght abyde and continue in
his ſonne, although we beleue
that the helpe of grace was not
wholly taken awaye from any
man? Of the whiche thinge we
wyll diſpute more largely hereafter.
Although peraduenture
this thinge be vnknowen alſo,
lyke as the other lyeth hydde

why in tymes paſt, all the gentiles
beinge ſette a ſyde, and let
paſſe, he toke vnto hymſelf one
people, whom he would inſtruct
in the waye of trueth? Of the
whiche iudgement of GOD, yf
we may not complayne, muche
leſſe then maye we murmure of
this that is done in the election
of al nations,VVe mai not be curious in hid thynges nor yet vnthankeful in manyfeſt things for the things
that God would haue to bee ſecrete
and vnknowen, maye not
be ſearched for: but thoſe thynges
which he hath made manifeſt,
are not to be denyed, leſt we
be founde vnlawefully curious
in the one, and dampnably vnthankeful
in the other. Truely
we are not ignoraunte, that
there bee ſome of ſo vndiſcrete
and vnaduyſed preſumption,
and of ſo proude an arrogancie,
that the thing which the noble
teacher of the gentiles, beynge

taught, not of men, nor bi men,
but by god, confeſſed to be laide
vp farre and excedynge hygh
aboue the meaſure of his know
ledge, thei dare raſhely diſcuſſe,
in a doctryne falſely ſo called,
and wyll there haue nothynge
hyd or ſecrete, nothynge to bee
vnknowen, where the Apoſtle
hath not opened what oughte
to be vnderſtande and knowen,
but what ought not to be ſearched
for. For as I haue ſayde afore,
it is geuen to no ſtudyes,
to no wittes to try out, bi what
iudgement, or what counſayle,
god which is immutably good,
immutably iuſt, alway forknowinge,
alwaye almightie, hath
therefore ſhutte vp all thynges
in vnbeleife, that he myghte
haue mercy on all. And yet in
the time wherein he inſtructed
Iſraell onely, he deferred to illumine

innumerable nations
of vngodlye people: and nowe
ſuffreth the ſame Iſraell to be
blynded, tyll all nations and
the fulneſſe of the gentyles bee
come in that peryſhe, by ſo many
thouſandes of thoſe that are
borne and dye againe, and yet
ſhall the ſayde Iſraell be ſaued
in them whom the ende of the
worlde ſhall finde here. The
whiche miſterie beinge opened
and ſet abrode in all the whole
body of the ſcriptures, he hath
ſhewed vs what he hath done,
what he doth or maye doe, and
what is yet to bee done. But
why it was his pleaſure that it
ſhould ſo be done, that is taken
away frō mans vnderſtanding.
But theſe men that are aſſhamed
to bee ignoraunt of anye
thinge, and by occaſion of the
darknes of ye matter, lay ſnares

of diſceyte, do referre to the merites
of mans will all the difference
wherebi god choſeth ſome,
and choſeth not other ſome (forRetribuci on, is the revvarde of vvell doing, or a revvard vvhere ſomthing is deſerued afore
many are called, and fewe are
choſen) ſo teaching that no mā
is ſaued freely, but of retribution,
becauſe it is naturalli graffed
in all men, that if they will,
they may bee partakers of ye veritie,
and that they haue grace
inough that doe aſke it. The
whiche diffinicion, although it
ſpeake not of ye veritie of grace,
yet ſemeth it to ſhewe ſome reaſon
of thoſe men that haue free
wil. But as touching infantes,
in whom ye cauſe is commen, &
al one with other mortal mē in
the original wound, & are with
out anye merite or deſerte of a
good will. There can no expoſicion
be made whereby it may
bee taught, why ſome of them

are ſaued beinge borne againe,
and why other ſome do periſhe,
not beynge borne agayne, and
that vnder hys prouidence and
omnipotencie, in whoſe hande
is the ſoule and lyfe of euery liuinge
thinge, and the ſpirite of
all the fleſhe of man, and vnto
whom it is ſayde.Iob. 14. The dayes of
man are ſhort, thou haſte nombred
hys tyme. But I ſuppoſe
theſe defenders of free will, wil
not vſe the ſympleneſſe of men
ſo ſhameleſly, that they will eyther
ſay that theſe thynges do
happen by chaunce, or els wyll
ſaye, that they whiche are not
borne agayne doe not peryſhe:
for then ſhould they bee manyfeſtly
conuinſed, either to agree
with the Paganes in deſtenye,
or elles with the Pelagians to
denye that ſinne is tranſfuſed
and powred forth vpon the poſteritie

of Adam.The Palagians deſerued to be condempned, becauſe they ſayd that infantes vvere vvithout ſinne. And the Pelagians
coulde not ſaye, that infantes
were vnbaptiſed by deſtenye:
but becauſe the ſaid Pelagians
durſt profeſſe that ſuch
infantes were free from ſynne,
they deſerued to bee condempned.
But foraſmuch as the queſtion
of the ſeperation of al mē
is already dyſputed and tryed,
and foraſmuch as infantes can
not be ſeperated from the nomber
of al men, & alſo foraſmuch
as the veritie ſpake of euerye
age, when he ſayd: the ſonne of
man is come to ſeke and to ſaue
that which was loſt.Luke. 19. Yf childrē regenerat be ſought and ſaued by Chriſt, then vere they once loſt being vnregenerate. In vayne
go ſuch men about to open the
depeneſſe of the vnſearcheable
grace by free wyll, whiche appoint
the cauſe of election, in
the merites of them that are
elected. And when they haue
brought foorth manye thynges

both foolyſhe and falſe, of the
will and iudgment of the elder
perſons: yet in the difference of
infantes they can ſay nothing,
nor once bragge that thei haue
yelded or rendred any reaſon of
that queſtion that is had in diſputacion
concernynge, all men,
and yet is not perfourmed on
all men. But the multiformitte
or diuerſitie, and alſo the great
neſſe of gods grace proueth that
ſuche men doe affyrme agaynſt
the veritie, that that thei ſpeake
of the elder perſons willes, and
alſo that the teſtimonies of the
holy ſcriptures are repugnant
to theyr perſwaſion. All the
whiche thinges, yf we ſhoulde
ſpeake of in thys preſent, there
ſhoulde be no ende of the diſputacion.
The which thinges not
withſtandinge, yf they come to
memory, they may not be omitted

that it maye be declared as
muche as is ſufficient, that all
the good merites of men, from
the beginninge of fayth, vnto
the ende of perſeueraunce, are
the gyft and working of god.

becauſe your fayth is ſpoken of

And ſhe wyng what he prayeth

For this cauſe we alſo ſince the

for this cauſe we thanke
god without ceaſinge, becauſe
that when ye receaued of vs
the worde, where with GOD
was preached, ye receiued it not
as the worde of man, but euen
as it is in deede the worde of
GOD, who worketh in you

ſhewed that the fayth of them
that beleue, is the gift of God,
then that thankes ſhould therfore

thei, to whom the worde of god
was preached by men, doubted
not therof as of ye word of men,
but beleued it as god ſpeaking

day, we went out of the Citie &
ſat down by a ryuer ſide, where
thei were wont to pray, and we
ſpake vnto the women whiche

woman whoſe name was
Lidia, a ſeller of purple, of the
Citie of Thiatira, a worſhipper

of god, heard vs: whoſe hart the
lord ſo opened, that ſhe attēded
vnto ye things that Paul ſpake.
And it is confirmed by ye words
of the veritie it ſelfe, that fayth
commeth not by mans wiſdom
but by the inſpiratiō of god, for
the lord ſaith to hys Diſciples.
But whom ſaye ye that I am?
Simō Peter anſwered, ſaying:
Thou art Chriſt ye ſonne of the
liuing god.Math. 16. Ieſus aunſwered &
ſaid vnto him: Bleſſed art thou
Simon the ſonne of Ionas, for
fleſhe and bloud hath not reueled
this vnto the, but my father
whiche is in heauen. Paule the
Apoſtle alſo telleth yt this faith
is geuen by meaſure, at ye pleaſure
of him yt geueth it, on thys
wiſe: I ſai vnto you al, through
the grace yt is geuen to me, yt no
man eſteme of himſelf more thē
becommeth hym to eſteme, but

that he diſcretely iugde of himſelfe
as god hath dealt to euery
man the meaſure of fayth. Alſo
the ſame Paule declaryng yt theRom. 12.
vnitie and agreemente of the
right faith, and the conſenting
to the honour of god, doth procede
and come of god, ſaith. The
god of pacience and conſolation,Rom. 15.
graunte you to be like minded
one towardes another of
you, after thenſample of Ieſus
Chryſte, that ye agreynge together,
maye with one mouth
prayſe GOD the father of our
Lorde Ieſus Chryſt. And afterwarde:
the god of hope fyll you
with all ioye and peace in beleuinge,
that ye may bee ryche in
hope, through the power of the
holy ghoſt. By the whiche teſtimony,
not onely fayth, but alſo
ioy and peace, and aboundance
of hope, are taught, not to bee

had but by the power and vertue
of the holy ghoſt. And the
Apoſtle, writing to the Epheſians
of the richeſſe of grace, (the
which grace geueth good thynges
for euyll), & of fayth which
is not hadde of our ſelfe but of
the gyft of god, ſpeaketh theſe
wordes. But god which is riche
in mercye,Ephe. 2. for hys great loues
ſake wherewith he loued vs,
when we were dead by ſynne,
hath quickened vs together in
Chryſte, by whoſe grace we are
ſaued, and hath rayſed vs vp,
and hath made vs ſit together
in heauenly thynges, through
Chryſte Ieſus: for by grace are
ye made ſafe through faith, and
that not of your ſelues, for it is
the gyft of God, & commeth not
of workes, leaſt any man ſhould
boaſte himſelfe. For we are hys
handy worke, created in Chryſt

Ieſu vnto good workes, vnto
the whiche, God hath ordeyned
vs before, that we ſhould walke
in them. Therefore the newe
creature hath thys propertie,
through grace, that they that
are of Gods faſſhioning, which
are made in Chriſt bi a heauēly
natiuitie, be not ydle ſluggardes,
nor geuen to ſloth, but encreaſe
from vertue to vertue, &
goe from ſtrength to ſtrength,
walking in ye way of good workes.
For this is to bee made in
faſhion. Thys is to bee made a
newe creature of an olde. This
is to be reformed frō the image
of the earthy man, into ye image
of the heauenly man. All the
which things he beginneth, he
augmenteth or encreaſeth, & he
perfourmeth & finiſheth eyther
openly by the cooperatours or
ioynt workers of grace, or elles

priuily, by ye ſecrete miniſtring
of the ſpirit, whoſe huſbandry,
whoſe buyldynge, and whoſe
workemanſhip we are.
            
            
               
                  Hovve that all the giftes of vertue are
geuen and ordered of the lord god,
and that al things are in his hand,
and that God is the aucthour of all
goodnes.
               
               ¶The .ix. Chapiter.
               
                  BY theſe teſtimonies,
as farre as I can perceaue,
it is ſufficiently
declared (although
other Documentes
myght be gathered) that fayth,
wherby the vngodly man is iuſtified,
is not had but by the gift
of god, and that the ſame is geuen
for no merites goynge before,
but is geuen to thend that
it might bee the beginninge of
merites, and where as it is geuen
vnaſked, it is geuen that

other good thinges myght bee
obtayned by her aſkinges.Grace is geuen before it be aſked. Concerning
the which thing, I wil
gather certaine teſtimonies out
of many which ſhewe forth the
aboundaunce of grace, by the
diuerſitie of the giftes thereof.
That it is of god therfore, that
a man choſeth the way of god,
and riſeth vppe when he is fallen,
the pſalme of Dauid ſingeth,
ſaying:pſalm. 36. The Lorde ordereth
a mans goynges, that he
may will his way, when he falleth
he ſhall take no hurt, for
the Lorde putteth vnder hys
hande. Alſo the ſame Dauid
teacheth that men come to god
by the leadinge of god,pſalm. 42. ſaying.
Sende forth thy lyght and thy
trueth, they haue led me and
brought me vnto thy holy hyll,
and vnto thy Tabernacle, or
place of thy dwelling.
               
               Alſo that the ſtrength of man
is in the lorde, and that the wil
of God doth preuent the deliueraunce
of man.pſalm. 58. My ſtrength
will I aſcribe vnto thee, (ſayth
he) for god euen my god is my
deliuerer, hys will ſhal preuent
me. In the prouerbes alſo, we
reade of wyſedome and vnderſtandinge:
for the Lorde geueth
wyſedome,prouer. 2. and from hys face
commeth knowledge and vnderſtandinge.
Alſo in the ſame
boke, ſpeakinge of the diſtribucion
of the wiſedome of GOD,
without the which, nothing is
wel done.prouer. 8. It is thus ſaid: counſell
is mine, defence is myne, I
am wiſdome it ſelfe, and power
is myne owne. By me kynges
raygne, and tyrauntes by me
obtaine the earth. Alſo in another
place, that no man can go
the right way, but by the ordering

of god.proue. 20. The ſteppes of man
are ordered of the Lorde. For
how doth a mortal man vnderſtande
his owne waies? Alſo in
another place.proue. 21. Euery mā thinketh
himſelfe to be iuſt, but the
lorde ordereth the heartes. And
afterward: the will is prepared
of the lord.proue. 19. Agayne in the ſame
booke, he ſpeaketh of thought
and deuiſe, on this wiſe. Many
thoughtes are in the heart of
man, but the deuiſe of the lorde
preuayleth. It is ſayde alſo in
Eccleſi. that both to haue thinges
neceſſarye, and to vſe them
wel, is the gift of God. There is
nothyng good to man,Eccleſi. 5. but that
that he eateth & drinketh, and
ſheweth hys ſoule good of hys
labour, and truely I haue ſene
theſe things. For it is in ye hand
of God: for who hath eaten or
ſhall eate without him? Alſo it
is red in the ſame bohe, that the

hartes and workes of the righteous
men, are in the hande of
God, and that thei ſo much profyte
and goe forwarde in theyr
ſtudies and deſyres, as he ſhall
geue.Eccle. 9. What paine ſoeuer a man
take to gette hym, he ſhall not
fynde hym, and whatſoeuer a
wiſe man ſhal ſay to him, to enſtruct
hym that he myght haue
knowledge, he ſhall not finde it
out. For I haue laid vp al theſe
thinges in my hart, & my harte
hath ſene al this, that both the
iuſt men & the wyſe men & alſo
their workes, are in the handes
of god. And it is ſpokē in ye boke
of wiſedome, of the ſame worke
of grace, on this wiſe. For he is
both the captayne of wiſdome,
and the amender of the wiſe. In
his hande are both we and our
wordes,Sapi. 7. & the knowledge of all
wiſdom and works, & diſcipline

Of Continencie alſo, that it is
had of Gods gift, the ſame ſcripture
ſpeaketh on this wiſe:Sapi. 8. After
that I knewe that I coulde
none otherwyſe be chaſt except
God gaue it me: and this was
alſo a poynte of wyſedome, to
knowe whoſe gyft it is. Vnto
the which ſentēce, the doctrine
of the Apoſtle Saint Paule agreeth,
wrytyng on this wyſe
in the firſt Epiſtle to the Corinthians.1. Cor. 7.
I would all men were
as I am my ſelf, but euery one
hath his proper gyfte of God,
one after this ſorte, another after
that. Alſo the Lorde in the
Goſpell of Mathewe declareth
the very ſame of chaſtitie. For
when his Diſciples ſayde: If
the cauſe of man and wyfe bee
ſuch, it is not expedient to mary.
Ieſus ſaith vnto them:Math. 19. All
men are not able to attayne vnto

that ye ſpeake of, but they to
whō it is geuen of my father.Eccleſi. 1.
It is read in Eccleſiaſticus on
the ſame wyſe, of the feare of
God and of wiſdom: The feare
of the Lorde is the crowne of
wyſdom, and both are the gift
of God. Alſo in the ſame. The
feare of the Lorde hath ſette it
ſelfe aboue all thynges: bleſſed
is the man to whō it is graūted
to haue the feare of the Lorde.Eſay. 33.
Eſay the prophet ſpeaketh likewyſe
of the ſpirituall rycheſſe,
whereof God is the aucthour.
Our ſaluacion commeth with
treaſures, as for wiſdome and
godlyneſſe, and nourture, they
come from the Lorde, theſe are
the treaſures of ryghteouſnes.
Alſo he ſpeaketh theſe wordes
of the depth of the riches of the
wiſdome & knowledge of God,
whoſe goodneſſe is preuented

with the merite of no manne,
whiche hath meaſured the water
with his hande,Eſay. 4. the heauen
with his ſpanne, and the whole
earth with thre fingers, which
hath wayed the mountaines in
the ſkaoles, and the rockes in
the balaunce: who hath knowen
the minde of the Lorde, or
who hath bene hys counſeller?
who canne inſtruct hym, or of
whom hath he aſked counſayl,
and he hath taught hym? Or
who hath ſhewed hym iudgement?
or who hath ſhewed hym
the waye of wiſedome? or who
hath fyrſt geuen to him, that he
may recompence him? whereof
alſo in the booke of Iob the
words of the lord are red in theIob. 4.
ſame ſence, ſayinge: who hath
geuen to me fyrſt, that I ſhould
recompence him? All thynges
that are vnder heauē are mine.
               
               Ieremias alſo ſayeth on thys
wiſe, that a mā hath right wiſdome
from god.Ierem. 10. O lord, I know
that it is not in mans power to
order his owne way, neyther is
it in man to rule his own iourney.
Alſo the Lorde proteſteth
by the ſame Prophete, that the
conuerſion of the hart to God,
is of God,Ierem. 24. and he ſayeth. I will
reſtore them vnto thys lande,
and I will newe buylde them,
and will not deſtroye them, I
wyll plant them, and not pulle
them vp. I wyll geue them an
heart that thei may knowe me,
for I am the Lorde and they
ſhalbe my people, and I wyl be
theyr God, for they ſhalbe conuerted
vnto me with theyr hole
heart. Alſo the ſame Prophete
ſhe wynge that it cōmeth of god
that we knowe god, ſayth. And
they ſhal knowe that I am the

Lorde theyr God, and I wyll
geue them an hearte to knowe
me, and eares to heare me. The
Apoſtle in the firſte Epiſtle to
the Corinthians,1. Cor. 12. teacheth that
euery good word and euery holy
worke, is the ſecrete working
if the holy ſpirit, without whō
nothing is well done, ſaying:
Therfore I do you to vnderſtād
that no man ſpeakynge in the
ſprite of god defieth Ieſus. And
no man can ſaye that Ieſus is
the Lord, but in the holy ghoſt.
For ther be diuerſities of giftes
or graces, and yet but one ſpirite,
and there be differences of
adminiſtracions, and yet but
one Lorde, and there be diuers
maner of operacions, and yet
but one God, which worketh al
in all. The gyftes of the ſpirite
are geuen to euery man to edifie
withall. For to one is geuen

the vtteraunce of wyſdome by
the ſpirite. To another is geuen
the vtteraūce of knowlege
by the ſame ſpirite,Fayth is the gift of God, and the vvorkynge of the ſpirit. to another
is geuen faith by the ſame ſpirite,
to another the gyft of healynge
by the ſame ſpirite, to another
propheſie, to another
iudgement to diſcerne ſpirites,
to another diuers tongues, to
another the interpretacion of
tongues: and al theſe worketh
one and the ſame ſpirite, deuidyng
vnto euery man,Not as vve liſt. euen as
he wyll.
               The ſame Apoſtle vnto the Epheſians
ſaith, that euery man
hath ſo much grace as the Lord
hath geuē him. One body & one
ſpirite (ſaith he) as ye are called
in one hope of your callynge.
One Lorde,Epheſ. 4. one faith, one baptiſme,
one God and father of
all, which is aboue al men, and

ouer all thynges, and in vs all.
For to euery one of vs is geuen
grace, according to the meaſure
of the gifte of Chriſte. For the
which cauſe he ſaith: He aſcended
vp on hyghe, and hath led
captiuitie captiue, and geuen
gyftes to men. Alſo the ſame
Apoſtle in the ſecond Corinthes
ſaith:2. Cor. 3. that we are not able to
thynke that that is ſpirituall,
but by the grace of God. Such
truſte haue we towardes God,
throughe Chryſte, not that we
are ſufficiente of our ſelues to
thynke anye thynge as of our
ſelues, but our ſufficiencie is
of God, whiche hath made vs
meete miniſters of the new Teſtament,
not in the letter, but
in the ſpirite: for the letter killeth,
but the ſpirite geueth
lyfe. Agayne in the ſame Epiſtle,
teachynge that the deſyre

and the ſufficiencie or ableneſſe
vnto good woorkes are miniſtred
of God,2. Cor. 9. he ſaith: God is
able to make all grace to abounde
in you, that ye all hauyng
ſufficient of all thynges,
maye be ryche in euerye good
woorke, as it is wrytten: He
hath diſpearſed abrode and geuen
to the poore, his ryghteouſnes
abydeth for euer. For
he that miniſtreth ſeede to the
ſower, ſhall geue you foode to
eate, and ſhall encreaſe the
fruites of your ryghteouſnes,
that ye beynge made ryche to
the vttermoſte, may haue plentie
vnto all ſingleneſſe.
               And the Apoſtle wryting to the
Epheſians, teacheth that all
good thynges where with God
is pleaſed are the gyftes of
GOD, and that it behoueth

them to be aſked of God, that
he may geue thē to thoſe which
haue them not. For this cauſe
(ſaith he) do I bowe my knees
vnto the father of our Lord Ieſus
Chriſte,Epheſ. 3. of whom is named
all fatherhod both in heauen
and in earth, that he woulde
geue you power accordynge to
the richeſſe of his glory, that ye
might be ſtrengthed by his ſpirite
in the inner manne, that
Chryſte myght dwell in your
hartes by faith: that ye beyng
rooted and grounded in loue,
myght be able to comprehende
with all Saintes, what is that
breadth and length, depth and
heyghte, and to knowe what
the loue of Chriſte is, whiche
loue paſſeth knowledge, that ye
might be fylled with all maner
of fulneſſe that cōmeth of God.
And vnto hym that is able to

do & to worke all thinges more
aboundauntlye in vs, then we
can either aſke or thinke, accordyng
to that power wherwith
he now worketh in vs. To him
he prayſe and glory in the congregation,
by Ieſus Chryſte
throughout al worldes Amen.
And Iames the Apoſtle telleth
in lyke maner, that God is the
aucthour of euery good thyng,
whoſe giftes are neither vncertaine
nor mutable, but proceadyng
of the eternall wyll,Iacob. 1, ſaying:
Do not ye erre my deare
brethren. Euery good gyft and
euery perfecte gyfte diſcendeth
from aboue from the father of
lyght, with whom there is no
variableneſſe, neyther is he
chaunged vnto darkeneſſe. Of
his owne good wyll begate he
vs with the woorde of trueth,
that we myght bee the firſte

fruites of his creatures. Vnto
whom the Prophete zacharias
agreeth,zach. 9. ſaying: In that daye
the Lorde ſhall ſaue his people
as ſheepe, for holye ſtones ſhall
be rolled vppon his lande. For
yf any thyng be good it is his,
yf anye thynge be precious, it
commeth of hym. And in the
Goſpell of Saint Mathe we it
is tolde lykewyſe, that knowledge
and vnderſtandynge are
the gyftes of God, whiche he
geueth to whom he wyll: Then
his Diſciples came vnto hym,Math. 13.
and ſayde: Why doeſte thou
ſpeake vnto them in parables?
But he aunſwered and ſayde
vnto them: becauſe that vnto
you it is geuen to knowe the
miſteries of the kyngedome of
heauen, but to thē it is not geuen.
Iohn the Euangeliſt doth
alſo ſhewe, that no man hath

any goodneſſe except he receiue
it from aboue,Iohn. 3. ſaying: A man
can receiue nothing except it be
geuen hym from heauen. The
veritie hym ſelfe alſo teacheth
in the ſame Goſpel, that no mā
commeth to the ſonne, vnleſſe
he be drawen of the father. For
god maketh him that ſhal come
both to vnderſtande and to be
obedient.Iohn. 6. No man (ſaith he) cā
come to me, excepte the father
which ſent me do drawe hym,
and I wyll reyſe hym vp in the
laſte daye. For it is wrytten in
the Prophetes: And they ſhalbe
all apt to be taught of GOD.
Euery one that hath heard and
learned of the father, commeth
vnto me. And afterwarde: For
this cauſe ſayde I vnto you
that no manne can come vnto
me, excepte it be geuen hym of
my father. The aucthoritie

of the holye Scriptures doth
confirme, that to go forwarde
and to continue vnto the ende
in faith and good workes, commeth
of the gyfte and helpe of
GOD. For the Apoſtle Paule
wrytynge to the Philippians
ſaith.Philip. 1. I ſurely beleue this, that
he yt hath begon a good worke
in you, wyll alſo accomplyſſhe
and perfourme the ſame in you
euen vnto the daye of Iheſus
Chriſte.Pelagius. A certayne man wyllyng
to conuerte the vertue of
this texte to his owne wronge
vnderſtandyng, woulde haue it
to be vnderſtande as yf it hadde
ben ſayde: whiche hath begon
of you, that both the beginning
and ending of the worke ſhould
be referred vnto man, and not
vnto God, which wylled both
to begin and to ende. But the
moſt excellent preacher of grace

hath confuted this moſt madde
pryde in the ſame Epiſtle,Philip. 1. ſaying.
Feare not ye your aduerſaries
for any thyng: for that
ſame that is to them the cauſe
of dampnation, is to you the
cauſe of ſaluacion,Fayth and pacience are the giftes of god for Chryſtes ſake. philip. 2. and that of
God. For vnto you it is geuen
for Chriſtes ſake, that ye ſhould
not only beleue in him, but alſo
that ye ſhould ſuffer for him.
And agayne: worke out your
ſaluacion with feare and tremblyng
(ſaith he) For it is God
that worketh in you the wyll &
the perfourmaūce, and that of
his good wyll. Alſo in the firſt
Epiſtle to the Theſſalonians he
teacheth, that the begynnyng,
the goyng forwarde, and the finiſhyng
of vertues, do come of
God, ſaying. God hym ſelfe, &
our father, & our Lorde Ieſus,
directe our iourney towardes

you,1. Teſſa. 3. and the Lorde multiplie
you, and make your loue aboū
                  dant
one towardes another, &
towardes all men, lyke as we
do abounde in loue towardes
you, to confirme your heartes
without faulte in holyneſſe of
lyfe, before God & our father, at
the cōming of our Lorde Ieſus
Chriſte with all his Saintes.
Alſo wrytyng to the Corinthians,1. Cor. 15.
and cōmending the fruitefull
perſeueraūce of all vertues
to be the gyft of God, he ſaith:
I thanke my God alwaye for
you, for the grace of God that
is geuen you in Ieſus Chryſt:
for ye are made ryche in all
thynges in hym, in all doctrine
and wiſdome, lyke as the teſtimonie
of Ieſus Chriſte is confirmed
in you, ſo that ye are
not behynde in any gifte, waytynge
for the appeeryng of our

Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, the which
ſhall alſo ſtrengthen you vnto
the ende without faulte, vnto
the daye of the comming of our
Lorde Ieſus Chryſte.
               Alſo vnto the Romaines he
ſpeaketh of the loue of Chriſt,
whereby he maketh them whō
he loueth, inſeperable, that is
to ſay: he maketh them to perſeuer
and continue vnto the
ende. For what other thynge
is it to perſeuer, then not to be
ouercome with temptacion?Rom. 8.
Who (ſaith he) ſhall ſeperate
vs from the loue of Chryſte?
ſhall tribulation? or perſecution?
or anguyſſhe? or hunger?
or nakedneſſe? or peryll?
or ſwearde? As it is wrytten.
For thy ſake we are kylled all
the day longe,pſalm 43. and are counted
as ſhepe appointed to be ſlaine:

But in all theſe thynges we ouercome
and haue the victorye
through hym that hath loued
vs.1. Cor. 15. Alſo to the Corinthians,
ſpeakynge of the victorye that
Chriſt worketh, he ſaith. The
ſtynge of death is ſinne. The
ſtrength of ſinne is the lawe:
but thanked be GOD whiche
hath geuen vs the victorye thorowe
Ieſus Chriſte our Lorde.
Alſo to the Theſſalonians of
the perſeueraunce or continuaunce
which God geueth,1. Theſ. 5. he
ſaith:It is only god that kepeth vs fautleſſe. And the GOD of peace
ſanctifie you through out, that
your whole ſprite ſoule and body
maye be kepte fautleſſe vnto
the comming of our Lorde Ieſus
Chriſt. Faithfull is he that
hath called you, which alſo wil
do it. Alſo vnto the ſame Theſſalonians:
that all our goodneſſe,
eyther in workyng or in

ſpeaking, and alſo the continuaunce
in the ſame are the giftes
of God, he ſheweth vs on this
wyſe,2. Theſſ. 2 ſaying: Our Lorde Ieſus
Chriſte hym ſelfe, and God
our father, whiche hath loued
vs, and geuen vs euerlaſtynge
conſolatiō and good hope thorowe
grace, comfort your heartes,
and ſtablyſhe you in al doctrine
and good doing. Furthermore,
my brethren pray for vs,
that the word of god may haue
free paſſage, and be glorified as
it is with you, & that we maye
be delyuered from vnreaſonable
and euyll men. For all men
haue not faith:2. Theſſ. 3. but the Lorde
is faithfull which ſhall ſtabliſh
you, and kepe you from euyll.
Let vs alſo heare the Apoſtle
Peter, frō whence he teacheth
the vertue of perſeueraunce to
come. The GOD of all grace

(ſaith he) whiche hath called
vs vnto his eternall glorye by
Chriſte Ieſus,1. peter. 5. ſhall his owne
ſelfe after ye haue ſuffred a litle
affliction, make you perfect, cō
                  firme,
ſtrength, & ſtablyſh you,
to whom be power and dominion
for euermore.1. Iohn. 4. Iohn the
Apoſtle alſo telleth on this
wyſe, that the victorie of the
Sainctes is the worke of God,
which dwelleth in the Saints.
Ye are of God lyttle babes, and
ye haue ouercome the worlde:
for he that is in you,1. Iohn. 5. is greater
then he that is in the worlde.
Alſo the ſame ſaith: All that
is borne of God ouercommeth
the worlde, and this is the victorie
that ouercommeth the
worlde, euen our fayth.
               It is declared alſo in the Goſpell
of Luke,Luke. 22. that it is Goddes
gyfte that menne perſeuer in

fayth. And Ieſus ſayde vnto
Peter: Simon Simon, behold
Sathan hath deſyred to ſyfte
you lyke meale, but I haue
prayed for thee Peter that thy
faith ſhould not fayle. And after
thou art conuerted ſtrength
thy brethren. And pray that ye
fall not into temptacion.
               We reade alſo in the Goſpell of
Iohn, that the veritie ſpeaketh
theſe woordes of the ſheepe of
Chriſt, which no man can take
out of his hand.Iohn. 10. But ye beleue
not, becauſe ye are not of my
ſhepe. My ſhepe heare my voyce
and I know them, and they folow
me, and I geue vnto them
eternall lyfe, & they ſhall neuer
peryſhe, neyther ſhall any man
plucke them out of my hande.
Alſo in the ſame Goſpell are
theſe thynges ſayde by the
mouth of the Lorde, of them

whom the father geueth to the
ſonne, who alſo come euery one
to the ſonne, and of whō none
doth peryſhe. All that the father
geueth me,Iohn. 6. commeth vnto
me, and him that commeth vnto
me I caſt not awaye. For I
am come downe from heauen,
not to do mine owne wyll, but
the wyll of hym that ſent me,
and this is the wyll of the father
that ſente me: that of all
whiche he hath geuen me, I
ſhulde loſe nothyng, but ſhulde
reiſe them vp againe in the laſt
day. There be many other thinges
in the diſcourſe and order
of the Canonicall Scriptures,
which I omit becauſe I wolde
be briefe. For the teſtimonies
that I haue reſited are not a
fewe, nor obſcure, nor yet of
ſmall aucthoritie: In whom
notwithſtandynge it is moſte

fully declared, that all thinges
pertayninge to the attayninge
vnto euerlaſtinge life, are neyther
begonne, neyther can bee
augmented, nor yet perfourmed
or finiſhed, without the grace
of God.1. Cor. 4. And againſt al election
that glorieth of free wyll, thys
ſentence of the Apoſtle doth
moſt inuinſibly impugne,That is to ſay, vvho hath made the difference betvvene the and the naughtieſt man in the vvorld, or vvho hath made thee better thē him. who
ſayth. But who diſcerneth the?
And, what haſt thou, that thou
haſte not receyued. And yf thou
haſt receiued, whi boaſteſt thou
as though thou haddeſt not receyued
it? Therfore the depth of
this queſtion, which we (accordinge
to the admiration of the
apoſtle) do confeſſe to be vnſearcheable,
is not aunſwered by
the will and nylle of free wyll.
For although it bee in man to
nille goodneſſe, yet excepte it be

geuen him he cannot wyll that
that is good, and the one hath
nature drawē vnto it by tranſgreſſion,
the other hath nature
receyued by grace. But
howe thys commeth to paſſe,
that thys one and the ſame nature,
(whiche before reconſiliacion
is in all men euyll, and in
all men myſerable) is not iuſtified
in all men: and is diſcerned
and deuyded into a certayne
part of it ſelfe, from thoſe that
peryſhe, by hym that came to
ſeeke, and to ſaue that peryſhed
and was loſte, cannot by the
witte of man bee tryed out in
any wiſe.
               For howe much ſo euer the curſednes
of wycked men is to bee
blamed, for reſiſtinge the grace
of GOD: ſhall that proue that
they to whom it is geuen, haue

deſerued it? Or elles that the
ſelfe ſame power and workyng
of grace, that ſubdueth to it ſelf
whom it will, was not able to
conuerte and tourne vnto it,
thoſe whiche remayne vnconuerted?
Euen ſuche were they
that are drawen, as they bee
whiche are lefte in theyr owne
hardneſſe. But vnto the one
part hath wonderfull grace geuen
what it woulde. And vnto
the other parte hath iuſte veritie
geuen that, that was due:
to the intente that the iudgement
of GOD maye bee more
vnſearchable in the election of
grace, then in the retribution,
and yeldynge of iuſtice.
               Notwithſtandinge, leaſte
that part of oure fayth ſhoulde
ſeeme to bee dymynyſhed,

wherein we godlye beleue that
God willeth al men to be ſaued
through the knowledge of the
truth, (by that that is euidently
ſhewed in ye effectes of grace)
we muſte labour and endeuour
thorow the helpe of Chriſt, that
the ſtabilitie and certaynetie of
this difference may appeare to
vs. And becauſe the buſineſſe of
ſo neceſſary a knowledge requireth
no ſmal trauaile
and diligence, we wyll
beginne the diſputation
that ſhall followe
in the beginninge
of
another
boke.

            ¶The contentes of all the
Chapiters of the ſeconde booke
of ſaint Ambroſe Biſhop of
Millaine, intituled of
the vocation of al
nations.
            THat there are three thynges in 
the queſtion aboue dyſputed,
whereon he ought to ſtande &
more largely to diſpute on, and
that God is a iuſte dyſpoſer, and
that (as touching thoſe thynges
whiche the Lord hath commaunded
the preachers) ther is no difference
made of any nation, neyther
is there any man excepted,
but that the Goſpell was ſent to
all men, and the grace of god our
Sauioure hath appeared vnto al
men: Alſo of the miſterie of that
whiche was ſpoken to the Apoſtles,
ye ſhal not go into the way
of the gentiles, &c. and of the ſecrete
iudgements of God in the
vocation and calling of men.
            That no man can come to the knowledge 
of the truth and apprehend

ſaluation by hys owne merites,
but by the helpe and working of
Goddes grace.
            
                Of the conſideration of the diuerſities,
wherby the workinges and gifts
of Goddes grace are diuerſly diſpoſed
            
                That the tourning away from God, is
not of gods ordinaunce or appoinment,
but of a mans owne proper
wyll.
            
                That before the comminge of Chryſte,
the nations that beynge alienated
and enſtraunged from the
conuerſation of Iſraell, hadde no
hope, were not therefore to bee
holden excuſed as blameles: and
howe through the perſecutions of
good men, Chriſte encreaſed hys
people.
            
                That Thryſte dyed for all wycked men
and ſinners.
            
                Howe that the miſterie of the callynge
of the heathen was knowen to
the Prophetes and alſo to the
Apoſtles.
            
                Why ſo great a multitude of infantes
beyng vnbaptized are ſeque ſtred

from eternall ſaluation.
            Howe grace prepareth the wyll, as a 
ſeruaunt and receyuer of her
giftes.
            A rehearſall of the thynges dyſputed 
and diffined in this ſecond booke,
with a concluſion of this woorke,
that is to ſaye: after what maner
God willeth all men to be ſaued.
         
         
            
            
            The ſeconde booke of Saint Ambroſe
Biſhop, of the vocation and calling of all
nations, vvherein he eſtabliſheth vvith
moſte fyrme and ſtronge argumentes,
thoſe thinges
vvhiche are
diffined
            
               ¶The fyrſt Chapter.
               
                  ALl contencion remoued
and ſettea
parte, the whiche
the bitter courage
of intemperate diſputacions
doth in
gender and brede. It is euident
that there are three thynges in
this queſtion, whereof I begin
this ſecond booke, of the which
it behoueth to entreate more
largely. One, whiche muſte of
neceſſitie be graunted, that god
willeth al men to be ſaued, and
to come to the knowledge of the

trueth. Another whiche in no
wyſe may be doubted: that no
manne can come to the knowledge
of the trueth by his owne
proper merites, but by the help
and worke of Gods grace. The
thyrde, which is to be confeſſed
is thys, namely that the depth
of goddes iudgementes cannot
be founde out nor attayned vnto
of mans vnderſtanding, and
that it ought not to be ſearched
whye he ſaueth not all menne,
whiche willeth all men to bee
ſaued. For yf that bee not
ſought for, whiche cannot bee
knowen, there ſhal remayne no
cauſe of contencion betwene
the fyrſt and ſecond diffinition:
but eyther of thē may bee preached,
and either of them may be
beleued with a ſure and a quiet
fayth. Surely god with whom

there is no vnequitie, and all
whoſe wayes are mercye and
trueth, the good maker of all
men, is a iuſte ordinatour and
dyſpoſer, he dampneth no man
vndeſeruinge, he delyuereth no
man of dutie, puniſhinge that
that is ours when he puniſheth
offendours, and geuynge of his
owne, when he maketh iuſte
men, that the mouth of them
whiche ſpeake vnrighteous
thynges maye bee ſtopped, and
that god may be iuſtified in his
ſayinges, and ouercome when
he is iudged. Neyther may the
complaynt of him that is damned
be iuſt, nor yet the arrogancie
of hym that is iuſtified bee
true.
               If eyther the one ſaye, he hath
not deſerued to be puniſhed or ye
                  
other ſay that he hath deſerued
grace. And lyke as thoſe ſayinges
the whiche I haue declared
out of the holye ſcryptures
for the ſettynge forth of grace,
cannot be confuted nor ſtayned
by any reaſon or craft of diſputacion,
ſo that ſo great a nomber
of ſentences playnely agreynge
together in them ſelues,
myghte bee drawen or wreſted
into any vncertaintie of a falſe
expoſicion: Euen ſo alſo, that
that is founde in the ſame body
of the ſcriptures touchynge
the ſaluation of all menne cannot
be reproued by any contrarye
argumentation: So that
the harder the ſame is to be vnderſtanden
and apprehended,
with ſo muche the more laudabler
fayth it ought to bee beleued.
Great is the force of conſent,

to whom thaucthoritie
is ſufficient to folow the truth,
yea although the reaſon of it
be vnknowen. Therefore let vs
diligently conſider, what the
Lorde commaundeth the preachers
of the Goſpell. For in
Saint Mathewes Goſpell he
ſayeth thus:Math. 28. All power is geuen
to me both in heauen and
in earth: Go your wayes therefore,
and teache all nations,
baptizinge them in the name
of the father, and of the ſonne,
and of the holy ghoſt, teachyng
them to obſerue all thynges
that I haue commaunded you.
And beholde I am with you
alwayes vnto the ende of the
worlde.Mark. 16. And in Saint Marke,
it is ſayde to the ſame Apoſtles
on this wyſe. Go ye into all the
worlde, preache ye the Goſpell

to euery creature: and whoſoeuer
ſhall beleue and bee baptized,
the ſame ſhall be ſaued, but
whoſo wyll not beleue ſhalbe
dampned. Is there anye difference
made here of anye nation
or of anye menne in thys commaundement.
He hath excepted
no man for merite, he hath ſeperated
no man for hys ſtocke
or linage, he hath made no difference
of the ſtate of men. The
Goſpell of the Croſſe of Chryſte
was ſent euen to all men. And
leſte the miniſterie of the preachers
ſhoulde ſeeme to bee done
by the onely woorke of manne:
beholde (ſayeth he) I am with
you alwayes euen vnto the
worldes ende: That is to ſaye,
when ye ſhall enter in as ſhepe
amonge wolues, be not afraide
of youre owne infyrmitie, but

put youre truſte in my power,Math. 10.
whiche vnto the ende of the
worlde wyll not forſake you in
all this worke or buſineſſe. Not
to the ende that ye ſhoulde ſuffer
nothynge: but that that
muche more is, I wyll brynge
it ſo to paſſe that ye ſhall not be
ouercome with the ragyng crueltie
of any tyrauntes. For in
my power ſhall ye preache, and
by me it ſhal come to paſſe, that
euen amonges the denyers and
thoſe that ſpeake agaynſt you,
yea euen amonges thoſe ye rage
againſt you, Abrahams childrē
ſhalbe raiſed vp of ſtones. I wil
put into theyr mindes whatſoeuer
I haue taught, and I wyl
perfourme that whiche I haue
promiſed. They ſhal betray you
in theyr counſayles, and ſhall
ſcourge you in their ſinagoges,

and for my names ſake ſhall ye
ſtande before Kynges and Rulers,
in a witneſſe to them, and
to the gentiles. But when they
ſhall delyuer you vppe, take no
thought howe or what ye ſhall
ſpeake: for it is not ye that ſhall
ſpeake, but the ſpirite of your
father that ſpeaketh in you.
               For the brother ſhall betray
the brother vnto death, and the
father the ſonne, and the Chyldren
ſhall ariſe againſt their fathers
and mothers, and ſhall
put them to death, and ye ſhall
be hated of al men for my name
ſake. But whoſoeuer ſhall endure
vnto the ende, he ſhall bee
ſaued. The grace of GOD
oure Sauyoure hath thereforeTitus. 2.
appeared (ſayeth the Apoſtle)
vnto all menne: and
yet were the gyftes of grace

hated of all men. And whyle
there were ſome that hated, &
other ſome that were oppreſſed
with the hatred of them that
perſecuted: yet was there neyther
of the parties depriued of
the name of all men, the portion
of the rebelles hauynge the
loſſe of theyr ſaluacion, but the
dignitie of the faithfull obteynyng
the nombre of al fulneſſe.
For the Apoſtle Saincte Iohn
ſaith:1. Iohn. 2. But yf any man ſinne,
we haue an aduocate with the
father, euen Ieſus Chriſte the
righteous, and he is the propiciation
for our ſinnes: and no
                     •
                  
for our ſinnes only, but alſo frr
the ſinnes of the whole world.
And it is a miſterie of a great &
vnſpekable Sacramēt, that vnto
thoſe preachers to whom it
was ſaid:Mark 16. Go ye into al ye world

& preach the Goſpell to al creatures:Math. 10.
vnto the ſame was it
ſayde afore, ye ſhall not go into
the waye of the Gentyles, and
into the Cities of the Samaritanes
ſhall ye not enter, but rather
go ye to the loſte ſheepe of
the houſe of Iſrael. For though
the Goſpell ſhoulde be directed
vnto the vocation and callyng
of all men, and the Lord would
al men to be ſaued, and to come
to the knowledge of the trueth:
yet notwithſtanding, he hadde
not taken away from himſelfe
the power and aucthoritie of
his diſpenſation, ſo that the order
of his councell ſhoulde run
otherwyſe then he had appointed
in his ſecrete and iuſt iudgement:
wherefore the murmuringes
of obſtinate mens complaintes
take no place. For it is

ſure, that whatſoeuer GOD
would haue done, ought not to
be done otherwiſe the he wold.
And in tyme paſte, what tyme
the Lord Ieſus ſate in the glorye
of God the father, and the
preachers of the worde dyd labour
in the buſineſſe that they
had taken vpon them,Act. 16. the Apoſtles
wyllynge to preache the
worde in Aſia, were forbidden
of the holye ghoſte. And when
they purpoſed to goe into Bithynia,
they were forbydden of
the ſpirite of Ieſus: Doubtleſſe
not that the grace of God
was denyed to that people, but
as it ſhoulde appeere, it was
protracted & delayed for a time.
For afterwardes the Chriſtian
fayth was of power among thē
alſo. But what the cauſe was
of the deferring of their calling

it is not knowen. And yet are
we taught by the example of
the thyng, that done it was: becauſe
that amonge generalles,
whether they bee promiſes or
workes, or els preceptes, God
knoweth by a ſecrete reaſon
how to ordeyne and diſpoſe certayne
thynges beyng excepted
from the common cauſes.
               I beleue, for that intent that
thoſe thyngs which ſhine more
dymlye, hauing ſhadowes ouer
them, myght apeere the more
marueylous to vs when we ſee
them: leaſt our ſight ſhould become
the more dull and negligent,
through the facilitie and
eaſynes of the ſight therof, and
ſhoulde after a certayne maner
ſlumber in accuſtomed thinges
yf it were not ſtyrred vp by vnaccuſtomed
thynges. And we

haue knowen theſe incognoſcible
delayes of illuminations to
haue happened in manye houſes
and families, amonge whō
doubtleſſe many peryſhe in vnbeliefe,
not onelye amonge the
wicked whiche are farre from
the trueth: but alſo euen in the
Cities of the beleuers, whyle
thei which are to become Chriſtians,
are agaynſt the Chriſtian
faith. For many ſhall loue
that they haue hated, and ſhall
preache that, that they do not
nowe alowe. And among theſe
thynges: who ſhall make it
knowē vnto theſe murmuters
or curious ſearchers, whye the
Sunne of ryghteouſnes ſhyneth
not yet to ſome Nacions,
and why alſo the veritie which
is to bee reuealed hereafter,
withholdeth at this tyme her

bright beames from the hartes
that are ſo ful of darknes: why
thei which are to be refourmed
afterwardes are ſuffred ſo long
to go aſtray, and why that that
is geuen to olde men in the end
of theyr lyfe, is not geuen them
by ſo long a time before? Whye
the chyldren beleue nowe in
Chriſt, and the parentes do not
yet beleue? And agayne, why
an euyll childe differeth vtterly
from his godlye and religious
parentes? And yet notwithſtanding
prayers are dayly made to
god (which is both the geuer of
the begynnyng of faith, & alſo
of then creaſe therof) according
to his cōmaundement: ſo that
both yf he mercifully do heare,
the grace of his mercy maye be
knowen, and alſo yf he do not
fauourably heare, the trueth of

his iudgement maye be vnderſtanden.
And alſo in times paſt
euen the ſame grace whiche after
the reſurrectiō of our Lorde
Ieſus Chriſt was ſpred abrode
euery where, and of the which
it is wrytten: (Thy illuminacions
hath ſhone abrode to all
the worlde) was not lacking in
the worlde.Pſalm. 76. For though it can
not be denyed but that the people
of Iſraell were elected by a
ſpeciall regarde and mercye of
God: and all other Nacions
were ſuffred to walke in theyr
owne wayes, that is to ſaye,
were ſuffred to liue after theyr
owne wyll: yet notwithſtanding,
the euerlaſtyng goodneſſe
of the Creatoure dydde not ſo
tourne away it ſelfe from thoſe
menne, that he dyd not admonyſſhe
them by ſome ſignificaſignifications

both to knowe
hym and alſo to feare hym.
               For heauen and earth, the ſea,
and euery creature which may
be ſeene & knowen, was chiefly
ordeyned for this profyte and
vtilitie of mankynde: to the
entent that the reaſonable nature,
through the beholdyng of
ſo manye kyndes of thynges,
throughe the experience of ſo
many good thynges, throughe
the receipte of ſo many gyftes,
might be inſtructed to the worſhip
and loue of his maker: the
ſpirite of God replenyſhyng all
thynges, in whom we lyue,
moue,Act. 17. and haue our beynge.
               And though that health be farr
from ſinners, yet is there nothing
voyde of the preſence and
power of his ſaluacion. Therfore
as the Prophete ſaith: The

earth is full of the mercy of the
Lorde,pſalm. 32. that neuer fayled anye
tyme or any generacion. And
he dyd euer beſtowe that ſame
prouidence, by the whiche he
doth geue and preſerue al thinges
to the gouernaunce & ſuccouryng
of nature, hauyng ordinarilie
prepared and appointed
by the immutabilitie of his
eternall councell, vnto whom,
and what he hym ſelfe woulde
diſtribute in theyr ſeaſons: and
alſo the vnſercheable and inueſtigable
meaſures of his manyfolde
grace, wherby he wold
diuerſly geue & diſtribute his
giftes and diuine miſteries. For
like as the liberalitie and large
neſſe of this grace, which laſt of
all had her influence vppon all
Nacions, doeth not euacuate
that which fell vpon one Iſraell

vnder the lawe, nor the rycheſſe
preſente do not abolyſſhe
the faith of the former penurye
and ſcarſeneſſe: Euen ſo lykewyſe
we muſte not imagine of
that care and regarde of God
whiche properly gouerned the
chyldren of the Patriarches,
that the mercifull gouernaunces
of God were withdrawen
from the reſidue of men: who
ſurely in compariſon of the electe,
ſeeme to be but abiectes,
but they neuer were repelled
from both manifeſt and ſecrete
benefites. For we reade in the
Actes of the Apoſtles,Act. 14. that
Paule and Barnabas the Apoſtles
ſayde to the Lycaonians:
Ye men, why do ye theſe thynges?
We alſo are mortall men
lyke vnto you, preachyng vnto
you that ye ſhulde be conuerted

frō theſe vaine things vnto the
liuing god, who made both heauen
& earth, the ſea, & al things
in thē conteined: who in times
paſt ſuffred al nacions to wander
theyr owne wayes. And yet
lefte he not hym ſelfe without
witnes, in that he ſēt vs his benefites,
in geuyng vs rayne frō
heauen & fruitfull ſeaſons, fylling
our hartes with foode and
gladneſſe. And what witnes is
this which euer ſerued ye Lord,
& neuer kept ſilēce of his goodnes
& power? but that ſame vnſpekable
bewtie of the whole
world, & the rych & orderly liberalitie
of his vnſpekable benefites,
by ye which certein tables
of ye eternall law were written
in the heartes of men: that the
cōmon and publike doctrine of
gods inſtitucion myght be read

in the bookes of the elementes.
The heauens therefore and all
the heauenlye bodyes, the ſea,
the lande, and all that euer is
in them, dyd preache the glorye
of GOD, with the conſonant
hermony of theyr kinde and ordinacion,
and by that perpetuall
preachyng they vttered the
maieſtie of theyr maker. And
yet notwithſtandyng, the greateſt
nombre of men which were
ſuffred to walke the wayes of
theyr owne wyll, dyd neyther
vnderſtande nor folowe that
lawe. And the ſauoure of lyfe
whiche ſmelled vnto lyfe, became
vnto them the ſauour of
death vnto death, ſo that alſo
euen in thoſe viſible teſtimonies,
it myght be learned that
the letter kylleth, but the ſpirite
geueth lyfe.
            
            
               
               The .ii. Chapter.
               
                  THat thyng therfore
whiche was
done in Iſraell,
throughe the ordinaunce
of the
law and the doctrine
of the Prophetes: that
ſame the teſtimonies of all creatures
& the marueylous workes
of God dyd continuallye among
all nacions. But foraſmuche
as among that people &
Nacion (to whom bothe thoſe
kyndes of erudicion was geuē)
no manne was iuſtified but by
grace, throughe the ſpirite of
fayth: who doubteth but that
they which were able to pleaſe
God, of what Nacion ſo euer
they were, or in what tyme ſoeuer

they were, were diſcouered
by the ſpirite of gods grace?
The which grace, though afore
tyme it was both more ſcarſe
and more priuie and ſecrete, yet
did it neuer denie it ſelfe at any
tyme in one power, in dyuers
quantitie, in immutable counſell,
in manyfolde operation.
For euen in theſe dayes, wherein
the ryuers of vnſpeakable
giftes do water ye whole world,
one maner is not geuen to all
men, nor yet one meaſure. For
thoughe all one and the ſame
veritie be preached to all men,
by the miniſters of the woorde
and of the grace of God, and al
one and the ſame exhortacion
geuen: yet is it the huſbandry
of God, and the buyldynge of
God (whoſe vertue woorketh
inuiſiblye) that, that whiche

is buylt may go forwarde, and
that that which is tylled maye
growe and encreaſe, as the Apoſtle
Paul witneſſeth, ſaying:
What is Apollo?1. Cor. 3. and what is
Paule? his miniſters are they
whom ye haue beleued, euen
as the Lord hath geuen to euerye
man. I haue planted, Apollo
hath watered, but GOD
gaue the encreaſe. So then,
neither is he that planteth any
thing, neither he that watreth,
but God that geueth the encreaſe.
He that planteth and he
that watreth are one, & neither
of them better then other: yet
ſhall euery man receiue his rewarde
according to his labour.
We are gods labourers, ye are
gods huſbandry, ye are goddes
buyldynge. Therefore euerye
man is ſo farre forth an helper,

a workeman, and a miniſter of
this huſbandry and buyldyng,
as the Lord ſhal geue vnto euery
man. And thoſe whiche are
tylled through the laboure of
the miniſters, do encreaſe vnto
that meaſure whereunto the
aucthour of the encreaſe ſhall
aduaunce them. For in the field
of the Lorde there is not al like
and one maner of plantynge.
And though the buyldyng of al
an whole temple do agree into
one beautie, yet haue not al the
ſtones therof one place, nor one
vſe. Lyke wyſe alſo in a bodye,
euery membre hath not one office,
as the Apoſtle ſaith.1. Corin. 12 But
nowe hath God diſpoſed and
ordered the membres and euery
one of them at this owne pleaſure.
And wherof theſe ſayde
membres become apte, wence

they become profitable, and
whence they become ſo beautiful,
the ſame doctour declareth,
ſaying. Therefore I do you to
vnderſtande, that no man ſpeakinge
in the ſpirite of God, defieth
Ieſus: and no man canne
call Ieſus the Lord, but by the
holy ghoſt. And there be diuerſities
of graces, and yet but one
ſpirite, and there are differences
of adminiſtrations, and yet but
one Lorde: and there be diuers
maner of operations, and yet
but one God which worketh al
in all.
               The gyft of the ſpirite is geuenThat is to ſai to euery man to vvhom they are geuen.
to eueri man to edifie with
al: For to one is geuen through
the ſpirite, the vtteraunce of
wiſdome: To another is geuen
the vtteraunce of knowledge
by the ſame ſpirite, to another

is geuen fayth by the ſame ſpirite:
to another power to do miracles.
To another prophecie.
To another iudgement or trial
of ſpirites. To another diuers
tongues, To another the interpretacion
of languages. And al
theſe thinges worketh one and
the ſame ſpirit, deuiding them
to euery man, euen as he wyll.
Seynge that the teacher of the
Gentyles hath ſhewed theſe
thynges with ſo great a lyght,
and ſuche a playneſſe: by what
reaſon or for what cauſe ſhould
we doubte of it? Doth not the
budde and beginning of al vertue
ſpringe to vs from GOD?
Alſo, who except he be to mad
wil complayne of the difference
of Gods giftes? Or thinke that
it is to be aſcrybed vnto vnlyke
merites: that it is not equallye

geuen of the heauenly liberalitie.
For yf thys diſtribution
ſhoulde come from hym, according
to the merites of any workes
that went before, the Apoſtle
woulde neuer haue knitte
vp the cataloge and rehearſall
of thoſe giftes with ſuch a concluſion,
as to ſay: Al theſe thinges
worketh one and the ſame
ſpirite, deuidinge vnto euerye
man as he wil, where no doubt
yf he woulde haue the cauſes
to be vnderſtande of merites, he
would haue ſaid: deuiding vnto
euery one as they deſerue. Like
as he promiſed a rewarde of deuotion
to the planters & waterers:
ſaying. Euery mā ſhall receiue
hys owne rewarde according
to his worke: therfore it is
geuen to eueri mā wtout merite
wherby he mai come to merite.

And it is geuen afore anye labour,He meaneth, to eueri man to vvhom it is geuē, as is ſayde a little before. Math. 25.
whereby euery man may
receyue rewarde accordynge to
his laboure. The which thinge
to be euen ſo: is alſo knowen bi
the teſtimonye of the euangelicall
trueth, whereas by a certayne
compariſon it is ſayde,
that a certayne man goinge into
a farre countrey, called hys
ſeruauntes, and deliuered vnto
them his ſubſtaunce, and vnto
one he gaue fiue Talentes, and
to another two, and to another
one, to euery man according to
hys abilitie, that is to ſay: according
to theyr proper and naturall
poſſibilitie: and not according
to theyr proper merite.
For it is one thynge to be able
to worke, and another thynge
to worke, and it is one thing to
bee able to haue charitie, and

another thing to haue charitie:
and it is one thynge to be capacious
of Charitie, of iuſtice, of
wiſedome: But it is another
thing to be chaſt, iuſt and wiſe.
               Wherfore, euery thinge that
is repayrable, is not repayred:
nor euery thinge that is curable,
made hole. For it commeth
of nature to be repayrable and
curable, but to be repayred and
cured, is of grace.
               And to conclude, thoſe to
whō an vnlyke number of Talentes
was geuen vnto, accordynge
to the meaſure of the capacitie,
that the diſtributour of
the ſubſtaūce foreſaw in them:
they did not receiue the reward
of merite, but the matter or ſubſtaunce
of the woorke: in the
whiche the vigilant diligence
of the two ſeruauntes is not

only honorable rewarded with
gloryous prayſes: but alſo is
commaunded to enter into the
euerlaſtyng ioy of theyr Lorde.
But the dul ydelnes and ſlouth
full wickednes of the thyrde, is
no ſuche wyſe punyſhed, that
both is he dyſhonored with an
opprobrious checke, and alſo is
diſpatched of the porcion or talent
that he hadde receyued, for
worthye was he to loſe his vnprofitable
fayth, that had not
exerciſed charitie.
               Wherfore in the wordes folowing,
(wherin moſte euidently
is declared the maner of the
iudgement to come) when the
ſonne of man ſhall ſytte in the
ſeate of hys maieſtie, all nations
beinge fyrſt gathered together,
ſome are led to the ryghte
hande, and other ſome ſhall bee

ſet on the lefte hande. When he
hath prayſed thoſe on his right
hand for the workes of charite,
nothing is els obiected to them
on the left hande, but the neglectinge
of mercy and louynge
kindnes. Theſe therefore hadde
alſo receyued fayth: but they
had not folowed loue. Neyther
ſhall they bee dampned becauſe
they haue not kept the gift, but
becauſe they haue not encreaſed
it. For although that all
good giftes are of god, yet ſome
of them are geuen of God vnaſked:
to the intente yt by thoſe
whiche are receiued, thoſe may
be ſought which are not yet geuen.
The ſede yt is ſowen in the
ground, is not ſowen to yt intēt
it ſhould remaine only ye ſame:
but yt in bringing forth fruit it
ſhuld become manifold & great

nomber: the proſperitie wherof
commeth from hym that geueth
the encreaſe. But nowe a
ground beyng lyuely and fruitfull
through the raine of grace,
hath that that is looked for of
it, accordyng to that, that it receiued
to be increaſed.
            
            
               ¶The .iii. Chapiter.
               
                  THeſe thynges (as I
ſuppoſe, and as far
as the Lorde hath
geuē me knowlege)
beyng rightly handled,
let vs retourne vnto that
from whence oure diſputacion
made digreſſion: that is to ſay,
to the conſideration of the differences
wherby the workes and
gyftes of gods grace are variated
and made diuerſe. The high

neſſe of the rycheſſe of Goddes
knowledge and wiſdom (whoſe
iudgementes are vnſearchable
and his wayes paſte fyndynge
out) hath alwayes in ſuch wiſe
moderated his merci and iudgement,
that in the moſte ſecrete
wyll of hys eternall counſayle,
he wold not that the meaſures
of his giftes ſhould be equall in
al thinges vpon al generations
or vpon all men. For after one
maner hath he holpen thoſe
men whom he taught to know
hym by the teſtimonyes of the
heauen and the earth: and after
another maner thoſe for whom
he had prouyded to bee holpen,
not onely by the ſeruyce of the
Elementes, but alſo by the doctrine
of the lawe, by the oracles
of the Prophetes, by myracles
and ſignes, & by the helpe and

ſuccour of aungelles. And he
much more otherwyſe declared
his mercy to all men, when the
ſonne of god became the ſonne
of man, yt he myght be found of
thē that ſought not after him,
and might apeare to them that
aſked not for hym. And that he
might haue ye preeminence, not
only in one people of ye ſtocke of
Iſrael: but that the multiplied
ſede of Abraham might ſpringe
in euery nation which is vnder
heauen. Into the which ſucceſſion
of heritage, not the Chyldren
of the fleſhe, but the Chyldren
of promyſe ſhoulde enter.
And that there ſhould be nowe
as great a ſcarſeneſſe of grace
among ye pleople of the Iewes,
as was in tymes paſte amonge
other nations. Neuertheleſſe it
is promyſed, that when the fulneſſe

of the gentiles is come in,
then their dryneſſe ſhal be watred
alſo. Who now cā tel what
the cauſes ſhould be of theſe diuerſities
& vnlikneſſes being al
vnder one and the ſame grace?
Or what the reaſon of it is, ſeynge
the ſcriptures doe not tell
it? And foraſmuch as the knowledge
of thapoſtle Paul in theſe
thinges paſſeth from diſputacion
vnto wonder: who dare preſume
ſo far, as to thinke yt theſe
cā be opened by diſputing, and
are not rather to be merueyled
at with ſilence. Let this ſecrete
therfore be pacientli & gentelly
vnknowen, that is ſet ſo far frō
mans vnderſtandynge. Yet, becauſe
things yt are cloſe ſhut vp
cannot be knowen: the intraūce
to things that are opened may
not bee ouerpaſſed and let ſlip.

For manye aucthorities of the
holy ſcriptures haue manyfeſtly
declared, and the continuall
experimentes of all ages haue
taught, that the iuſte mercye of
God, and hys mercifull iuſtice,
hath not ceaſed at any tyme to
noriſhe the bodyes of men, nor
to teache them, nor yet to helpe
their vnderſtandings & mindes.
For it hath euer rayned on the
                     
                        •
                     ath. 5.
good and bad, he hath made his
ſonne euer to aryſe vppon both
the iuſte and vniuſte: he hath
euer geuen the breath of life, he
hath euer geuen the continuall
courſes of the day & the nyght,
he hath euer geuen fruitfulnes
to the grounde, encreaſe to the
ſeedes, and fecunditie or multiplyinge
to the generation of
men. And if he haue at ani time
diminiſhed any of theſe things,

he hath chaſtened with gentle
correction the backtourninges
and ſlouth of thoſe that abuſed
them, to the intente that they
ſhoulde ſeeke his mercy in theyr
aduerſitie, whoſe iuſtice they
feared not in theyr proſperitie.
               Furthermore, yf we haue recourſe
to the very beginning of
the worlde, we ſhall fynde that
the ſpirite of God was the gouernourGeneſ. 6.
of all the ſaintes that
were before the fludde, for the
whiche cauſe they were named
the ſonnes of God.Rom. 8. For as thapoſtle
ſayth: whoſoeuer are ruled
or led by the ſpirite of God,
thei are the ſonnes of God. And
when they hadde neglected the
obſeruations of theyr fathers,
by mynglynge them ſelues in
the vnlawfull mariages of the
reprobates, and for that wicked

ſocietie and mingling were iudged
worthye of deſtruction: the
lorde ſayde. My ſpirite ſhal not
abide in theſe men, for they are
fleſh. Wherby it appeareth that
the ſame people, whoſe generation
are ſette in a diuerſe order
with the number of their yeres,
was afore that ſpirituall, euen
in the ſame wyl which the holy
ghoſt doth gouerne: beſtowinge
the temperauncye of hys regyment
and gouernaunce in ſuch
ſort, that he toke not away the
power to declyne to ſynne: the
which power if this people had
not hadde, they coulde neyther
haue forſaken God nor yet bee
forſaken of God: It ſhoulde bee
that ſame of whom it is ſpokē.
Happye is he that was able to
offende, and hath not offended.
Duryng the tyme therfore thatEccle. 13.
                  
thys people abode in God, they
remayned in that wyl that god
inſpyred and gouerned. For the
wyll (as it is wrytten) is prepared
of the Lord. But of this preparation
there is not alwaye
one ſucceſſe nor yet one meaſure:
for the workes and gyftes
of grace are diſceuered in dyuerſe
wiſe and by innumerable
differences, and in euerye kinde
of the ſaid gyftes, there are vnlyke
degrees and vneuen quantities.
For lyke as in the comming
vp of earbes & trees that
the earth bringeth forth, there
is not al one beauti or likenes,
nor one kynd of thē al, but euery
one of them cōmeth forth in
ye forme of his owne ſeede, & in
the quantitie of his own kynd:
neither do thei receiue ful beautie
incontinent, aſſone as they
come foorth, but come forward

by certayne orderly encreaſing,
vntyll they come to the perfyte
quantitie of theyr ſtate that
happened vnto thē by the ſame
increaſinge or growinge. Euen
ſo, the ſedes of the gyftes of the
holy ghoſte, and the plantes of
vertues, do not growe in euery
fielde of mans heart hollye, the
ſame and attonce that thei ſhal
bee afterwardes. And it is an
harde thinge to fynde ripeneſſe
in the beginning, and perfection
in the firſt entraunce.
               Yet many tymes the mightie
and mercyfull God doth poure
forth theſe meruaylous effectes
of his workinge, and whatſoeuer
he wyl geue, that ſame conueyeth
he into certaine mindes
altogether and at once, the tariynge
for encreaſe not wayted
for. Leui is ſanctified in the

loynes of Abraham, and with
hym is alſo the houſe of Aaron
and prieſtly order bleſſed. In Iſaac
conceiued by promiſe and
borne contrarye to the hope of
the olde barreyne parentes, is
the callyng of all the Gentyles
and the fourme of Chryſt layde
vp and hyd. Iacob beyng beloued,
without any helpe of merite
is elected before he is born.Ierem. 1.
To Iheremye it was ſayde:
Before I faſhioned thee in the
wombe I knewe thee, and or
euer thou were borne I ſanctified
thee.Luc. 1. Iohn reioyſeth being
filled with the holy ghoſt in his
mother Elizabethes wombe:
And that there maye be none
greater among the chyldren of
women, he feeleth the begynnynges
of grace before the begynnynges
of nature. But although

there wante not other
examples of the lyke doctrine,
the whiche I ouerpaſſe becauſe
I woulde be briefe: yet is that
ſort of men thicker and more in
nombre, vnto whom what ſoeuer
the heauenlye liberalitie
particulerly geueth, doth grow
by lyttle and lyttle, to thintent
that the cauſes of the gyftes
which are to be geuen, maye be
brought forth of ye giftes which
are already geuen. Some there
be,Mark. 9. which after they haue receiued
faith, are not without diffidencie
& miſtruſt, which doubtleſſe
he knewe to be in himſelf,
whiche ſayde: Lorde I beleue,
helpe mine vnbeliefe. And the
which they perceiued not to be
quite out of theyr myndes that
ſaide:Luke. 17. Lord encreaſe our faith.
Some men do not vnderſtande
the thing that they do beleue, &

many of thoſe are long holden
in the meaſure of their ſimplicitie.
Many do ſone receiue the
light of vnderſtādyng, & yet the
ſame vnderſtāding hath not in
all men one power and force, or
like aptneſſe. And manye men
there be, which when thei ſeme
to be decked and adorned with
faith & vnderſtanding, yet faint
they for lacke of charitie, & can
not abide in thoſe thinges that
they ſee by faith and vnderſtanding:
for a man cannot alway
continue in that thing that he
loueth not with all his harte.
Alſo the gyft of charitie it ſelfe
is not alwayes ſuche, that the
receiuer thereof can take at
once whatſoeuer belongeth to
the fulneſſe therof. For there is
a loue which may be ouercome
with another loue, and many
times the loue of GOD fadeth

and widdereth awaye through
the loue of the world: except it
encreaſe to ſuche an heate thorow
kindling of the holy ghoſt,
whiche can be quenched with
no colde, nor waxe fainte thorowe
any heate.
               Therefore, when in this vnſpekable
gifte of God there is a
ſumme of all gyftes, or a purpoſe
whereto they are geuen, &
alſo a certeyne lyfe of all vertues:
all other giftes are geuen
to this ende and purpoſe, that
the entent of the faythful ſoule
maye haue whereby it maye
preaſe and attayne to perfite
charitie. The which, becauſe it
is not only of god but alſo God
himſelfe, it maketh men ſtable
and durable, and alſo vnable
to be ouercome, whom it hath
fylled with the ryuer of his

pleaſures. But they that know
not the ſweteneſſe of theſe waters,
and drynke yet of the ryuers
of this worlde: or elles yf
they haue taſted anye thyng of
the well of lyfe but with theyr
lyppes onely, and yet do deſyre
to be dronken with the golden
cuppe of Babilon: thoſe are
vtterly deceaued in theyr owne
free choyſe, & are fallen awaye
by theyr owne free wyll. And
yf they continue in that ſluggardy,
they ſpoyle themſelues
of that they haue alreadye receiued.
For anye kynde of good
thing may eaſely periſhe without
charitie, the which coulde
not profite without
charitie.
            
            
               The .iiii. Chapter.
               
                  
                  AND theſe thynges
whiche I haue briefly
and compendiouſly
touched,Gods ordinaunce extendeth not to the fall of men. do ſuffice
to this purpoſe, that
we may moſte certeynly knowe
how that no faithful man, not
departyng from GOD, is forſaken
of hym, neyther that
the fall of anye manne is appoynted
by the ordinaunce of
god. But many which yet haue
the vſe of reaſon, are therefore
at libertie to tourne backe, becauſe
that not to haue tourned
backe myght haue a rewarde,
and that the thing which could
not be don without ye working
of the ſpirite of God myght be
reckened for theyr merites, of
whom it coulde not bee done
by wyll, whiche wyll in euyll
actions can be alone, but

in good doing it canne not be
alone. For though it be agreable
to mans nature to be of a
good wyll: yet the vice or fault
that fell into nature throughe
an euyll wyll, is not ouercome
by the power of nature, but by
the power of grace. Therefore
that firſt people was gouerned
by the ſpirite of God, and dyd
obteine from the felowſhip and
maners of that curſed and foredampned
people, through the
information of the holy ghoſt:
kepynge a ſeperation of themſelues,
from mynglynge with
the carnall men: whoſe euyls
the long ſuffryng of Godde dyd
ſo long forbeare, as the good
menne pleaſed hym in that
they dydde not folowe them.
But afterwardes, when the
good men were corrupted alſo

through folowyng of the euyll,
and dyd through the faulte of
wyll, wholly conſpire together
into al one wickedneſſe. Whom
(the houſe of Noah excepted)
one vngodlyneſſe had polluted,
one ſentence and iudgemente
dyd roote out and deſtroy. But
the goodneſſe of God fayled not
that part of men which remayned
not in charitie, but ſwelled
from the beginnynge of
them with the poiſon of the deuylles
malice:Cayne. For the Lorde
vouchſafed through his fatherlye
counſell, to mittigate the
prince of that wicked Nacion,
(who enuied the good woorkes
of his holy brother, and imagined
his death in his miſcheuous
harte) ſaying to Cayne:
Why art thou ſadde?Gene. 4. why doeth
thy countenaunce change? If

thou offreſt ryghtly, and yet deuideſte
not ryghtly: haſt thou
not ſinned? Be content, for the
amendment therof ſhal belong
to thee, and thou ſhalt rule the
matter. Put awaye (ſaith he)
thy ſadneſſe, that aryſeth of an
enuious diſdayne, and quench
the flames of thy cruell hatred.He meaneth that Cayne deuided the vvorſte of his fruites to GOD, vvhereas he ſhould haue geuē the beſt.
Abell hath not hurte thee, nor
done thee harme in pleaſynge
me. I haue deſpiſed thine offeringes
by mine own iudgemēt,
not by his deſire. Thou haſte
done a good woorke negligentlye.
Chine oblation hadde ben
ryght, yf the deuiſion had ben
ryght. Thou oughteſt to haue
knowen what thou ſhouldeſte
offer, ſeyng thou kneweſte to
whō thou ſhouldeſt offer. Thou
haſte not ryghtlye deuided betwene
me & thee, becauſe thou

haſte reſerued the beſte to thy
ſelfe. This errour therefore is
thine, & this treſpace is thine
owne: be quiete, and be not
moued agaynſt thine innocent
brother, but rather let thy faut
be reuoked to thy ſelfe. Let not
ſinne raigne and beare rule ouer
thee, but rather take thou
to thy ſelfe dominion ouer it:
For by repentynge, both thou
ſhalt not proceade into greater
miſchief, and alſo ſhalt be clenſed
from the thynge wherein it
greeued thee that thou haddeſt
diſpleaſed me. Therfore when
God ſpake ſuch things to Cain
is it to be doubted that he wold
haue brought to paſſe (yea and
it ſuffiſed as touchyng the maner
of his healyng) that Caine
ſhoulde haue repented of his
vngodly furye? But his ſtoute

malice became the more vnexcuſable,
of that thyng whereof
it ought to haue bene the better
refourmed. And doubtleſſe,
God knewe before to what end
the conceipt of the franticke felow
would come: neither was
his miſcheuous wyl compelled
to ſinne by neceſſitie, becauſe
the knowledge of God coulde
not be diſceiued. From whoſe
conſpiracie and workynge alſo
the lyfe of Abell myght haue
ben preſerued without harme:
but that it pleaſed GOD with
the greate prayſe of his pacience,
that the temporarie woodneſſe
of the wicked man, ſhould
become the perpetuall honour
of the iuſt mā. And who cannot
eaſelye perceaue that the goodneſſe
of God neuer denied it ſelf
to ye poſterite of this murtherer

of his brother, althoughe they
lyued in the maners of theyr
forefather, if he would but conſider
how much ſo long a pacience
of God, ſo greate a plentie
of temporall goodes, & ſo great
a nombre of iſſue encreaſed,
myght haue profyted them?
The which benefites, although
they dyd nothynge helpe to the
remedie and amendment of thē
that were obdurate and hardened:
yet do thei proue that their
fallyng away proceaded not of
Gods ordinaunce, but of theyr
owne wyll. But in the preſeruaciō
of Noah, & of his ſonnes
and daughters in lawe, in whō
the hope of thincreaſe of al nacions
was laide vp: how great
workes of Gods grace were declared,
the holy Scripture doth
tell plainly. Foraſmuch as by

that ark, which was of ſo wonderfull
wydeneſſe yt it receiued
al kindes of beaſtes (ſo much as
belōged to the ſtore of encreaſe)
the Church was figured, which
was to bee gathered together
out of all nacions of men, vnto
it ſelfe: when by a tree and by
water, the redemption on the
Croſſe and the waſſhyng of regeneration
is opened: when in
them that were ſaued frō that
deſtruction of the worlde, the
fulneſſe of all the Gentilles is
bleſſed: when the bleſſynge of
the encreaſe of mankynde is renewed,
and libertie encreaſed
to eate what men liſt (ſtrangled
and bloud only forbodden) And
the ſecuritie and ſauftie of our
ſaluacion was conſecrated, in
the teſtimonie of the bowe of
manye colours, that is in the

ſygnes of manyfolde grace.
               The whiche Sacramentes and
miſteryes verely, dyd not onely
enſtruct thoſe fewe men of one
houſholde that were then: but
alſo in them, all theyr paſterities
and ofſpring, to the entent
that the thyng that was geuen
to the reformation of the parentes,
might profite towardes
the inſtruction of the Children.
And nowe, when in proceſſe of
tyme, the poſterities and generatiōs
of men were increaſed, &
the great number of mortal mē
were waxē proude of theyr multipliynges,
and according to the
height of theyr pryde, went about
to builde them a tower of
an vnmeaſurable buyldynge,
that it ſhuld reach vp vnto heauen:
How meruailous was the
cenſure of gods iuſtice in repreſſing

of that theyr arrogant preſumption?
which did confound
that one onely ſpeache of thoſe
people that was ſo conſonante
and agreeable with ſignifications
that were knowen to euery
man amonge themſelues, in
to the diuerſitie of .lx. and .xii.
tougnes: that the agreement of
the workmen periſhing in diſagreable
voyces, the purpoſe of
theyr mad enterpryſe myght be
brokē: and that he myght cauſe
them to inhabite vppon all the
whole face of the earth, thorow
the neceſſarye ſcatterynge abrode
of an euill gathering together.
And the myracles of the
Chriſtian grace were foreordayned
in that woorke of
Goddes prouydence, whiche
ſhould afterward call together
all them that were ſo dyſperſed

into the couplement of that
buyldyng wherein euery knee
boweth to GOD, and euery
tongue confeſſeth that Ieſus
Chriſt is in the glory of the father.
               This ſame largeneſſe of grace
dyd the promyſe of Godde that
was made to Abraham declare,
to be opened nowe in the fulneſſe
of the times appointed, by
more euident tokens, what
tyme as his double ſucceſſion
(that is to wete, the children of
the fleſſhe, and the chyldren of
promeſſe) was compared to the
multitude of grauell ſtones, &
of ſtarres.philip. 2. And the olde man beyng
farre from the hope of hauyng
anye iſſue, throughe the
aged barreynneſſe of his wyfe:
beleued in a cōmendable faith
through the iſſue of one ſonne,

that he ſhould be ye father of the
whole worlde,Iohn. 8. foreſeeyng or rather
beholding him in his ſede,
that ſayde: Abraham ſawe my
day, and reioyſed. By the which
fayth, whē Abraham was iuſtified,
he had not yet receyued the
commaundement of circumciſion:
but his faith was counted
to hym for righteouſnes, when
he was yet in his naturall prepution
or vncircumciſion.
               And that ſame fayth receyued
the ſeale of circumciſiō,Ieſus Chriſt. in that
ſame member wherby the ſeede
of procreation might come vnto
that fleſhe, wherein without

               ¶The .v. Chapiter.
               
                  ANd this faith was
holdē within oneGene. 12.
ſtocke of people,
before that ſeede
came, of whom it
was ſaid to Abraham:
In thy ſeede ſhal all nations
of the earth bee bleſſed, the
hope of our redemption, beyng
alyue amonge the true Iſraelites.
For although there were
ſome of the ſtraunge nations,
whom it vouchſafed the veritie
to lyghten in the tyme of the

lawe: yet were they ſo feawe,
that it coulde ſcarce be knowen
whether there were any or no.
Neyther for all thys were the
nations to bee holden excuſed,
which beyng enſtraunged from
the conuerſation of Iſraell, hauynge
no hope, and beynge
without GOD in this world,
peryſhed in the darkeneſſe of ignoraunce.
For thys aboundaunce
of grace, that now wattereth
all the worlde, dyd not
flowe aforetime with like plenteouſneſſe,
for there was euermore
a certayne meaſure of the
heauenly doctryne geuen vnto
all men: whiche notwithſtandynge
it was of a more ſcarce
and ſecrete grace, yet was it
ſufficient as the Lorde iudged
it vnto ſome menne for a remedye,
and vnto all menne for a

teſtimonie, that it myghte appeare,
not doubtfullye but euydently,
that except, where ſinne
was aboundaunte, there grace
had beene more aboundaunt,
the lyke wickedneſſe hadde alſo
blynded all mankynde nowe in
theſe daies. Whether peraduenture
are there better wyttes in
theſe oure dayes (as ſome men
bable) then were of olde time? &
haue the latter tymes brought
forth myndes yt were more apt
to receyue Goddes gyftes? The
whiche thinge if it were ſo, yet
ought it to bee aſcribed to the
goodnes of the authour, which
made ſuche myndes as were
not afore, that the people might
be called vnto eternall life. But
there is nothinge innouated or
new chaunged in the carnal generation,
neither is ye ofſpringe

of the ſucceſſours growen more
genteller then theyr aunceſtours.
But rather in the men
of that tyme, wherein the redemer
of the worlde came: Looke
howe muche more duller that
progeny and ofſpringe was become,
ſo much the ſtronger was
iniquitie founde in them. The
vngodly fury of the Iewes proued
thys right well. And howe
apte that generation was to
the Goſpell of Chryſt, not onely
the hartes of the common people,
but alſo the heartes of the
Scribes, Princes, and Prieſtes,
haue declared. To whō it was
but a trifle to waxe woode in
crueltie and tirannye agaynſt
the lambe of God that taketh
away the ſinnes of the worlde,
by ſedicion, contumelies and reproches,
ſpittinges, buffettes,

and blowes, ſtoninges, ſcourginges,
and at the laſt by crucifiyng
him on the Croſſe contrary
to the teſtimonie of the law,
contrarye to the oracles of the
Prophetes, & contrary to ye practiſing
of godly vertues: But alſo
thei perſecuted the witneſſes
of hys reſurrectiō with the like
fury & madnes. The whiche the
Apoſtles, when thei were ſcourged
of ye high Prieſtes, ſhewing
the ſame out of Dauids pſalm:
ſayde. Lorde, thou art he that
haſte made heauen & earth, the
ſea & al that are in them, which
in the holy ghoſt by the mouth
of thy ſeruaunt Dauid our father,
haſt ſayd: Why do the heathen
rage, & the people imagine
vayne thynges? The kynges of
the earth doe ſtande vp, and the
rulers haue aſſembled together

agaynſt the Lorde and hys annoynted,
for of a ſuretie both
Herode and Ponce Pilate, with
the gentiles and people of Iſraell,
haue aſſembled together in
thys Citie, agaynſte thy holye
childe Ieſus, to do whatſoeuer
thy hand and counſell haue determined
to be done. Therefore
to the ſettynge forth of Goddes
grace, which was diſpoſed and
bent of gods eternal & vnchaū
                  geable
counſell vnto the ſaluation
of al nations, the former
tymes were not eſchewed, as
not able to apprehende them:
But theſe tymes were elected,
the whiche haue brought forth
ſuch a people, whoſe fearce and
cruel wickedneſſe, ſhould go forwarde
in doynge thoſe thinges
that the hande of God and hys
counſell haue determyned to be

done: not of the deſyre to profyte
any mā, but to thintent to
deale cruelli: that the grace and
power of God myght be ye more
wonderfull, whiche of ſo harde
hartes, ſo darke mindes, and ſo
enuious ſtomackes hath made
a people to himſelfe both faithfull,
obedient, and holy, whiche
came not to the knowledge of
the wiſdome of god, by the wiſdome
of this worlde: but by the
gift of hym, of whom thapoſtle
S. Iohn witneſſeth,1. Iohn. 5. ſaying. We
knowe that the ſonne of God is
come, & hath geuen vs a minde
to knowe the true GOD, and
might be in his true ſonne. Vnto
the whiche teſtimonie the Apoſtle
Paule agreeth,Colloſſ. 1. ſayinge.
We thanke GOD, which hath
made vs worthye to bee partakers
of the inheritaunce of the

Sainctes in lyght, which hath
delyuered vs from ſynne, and
from the power of darknes and
hath trāſlated vs into the kingdome
of his derely beloued ſon.
And agayne he ſayeth.Timo 5. For we
were ſomtime (ſayth he) foliſhe,
vnfaithfull, wandering aſtray,
ſeruing diuers deſyres & luſtes,
liuinge in malice and enuy, hatinge
one another. But when
the benignitie and gentleneſſe
of oure Sauiour appeared, not
of the workes of ryghteouſnes
whiche we wrought, but according
to his merci hath he ſaued
vs, through the lauer of regene
ration of the holy ghoſt, which
he hath poured foorth on vs aboundauntlye,
through Ieſus
Chryſte our Sauiour, that we
beynge iuſtified by hys grace,
might be heyres of euerlaſtyng

lyfe through hope. Coulde it be
more fully, more euidentlye, or
more truely declared what merites
Chriſt founde in men, and
what maners he ſubdued vnto
himſelfe? what heartes he conuerted
vnto him, when he came
not to heale thoſe that were
hole, but the ſicke, and to call,
not the iuſte, but the ſinners to
repentaunce?Note. For the people of
the gentiles which ſat in darknes
ſawe great lyght, and vnto
them that ſat in the region and
ſhadow of death light is begon
to ſhyne. The heathen raged,
the people of the Iewes were
angry, kinges waxed fearce, the
high powers counterſayde, & al
the ſuperſticions and errours
of the whole world impugned.
But of the veri reſiſters, of ye ragers,
& of them that perſecuted,

Chryſt augmented hys people,
& through enpriſonmentes, puniſhments,
and death, the faith
of the Sainctes was ſtrengthned,
the trueth got the victory,
and the come of the Lordes
fielde did aboundantly encreaſe
all the worlde ouer: for there
was ſuche conſtancye of fayth
geuen from aboue, ſuche confidence
of hope, and ſuch ſtrength
of pacience, that the ſame fyre
of loue whiche the holy ghoſte
hadde kyndled in the heartes of
faythfull men, coulde not bee
quenched of the oppreſſours by
anye maner of meanes, when
euen they whiche were tormented,
were the more feruenter, &
thei which perſecuted them, did
mani times fele as great heate,
as thoſe did whom thei perſecuted.
Wherwith thapoſtle ſ. Paul

beynge inflamed, ſayde boldely
and feruently:Rom. 5. Seyng therfore
that we are iuſtified by fayth,
we are at a peace with GOD,
through our lord Ieſus Chriſt,
by whom we haue free acceſſe
or comminge through faith vnto
thys grace wherin we ſtand,
and reioyce in hope of the glory
of the ſonnes of God. Not only
that, but we reioyce in tribulation:
knowinge that tribulation
worketh pacience, and pacience
woorketh proofe or experience,
proofe woorketh hope,
hope is not aſhamed, neyther
departeth emptie. For the loue
of God is ſhed abroade in oure
heartes, through the holy ghoſt
which is geuen vs.Rom. 8. And againe
he ſayth: Who ſhall ſeperate vs
from the loue of Chriſt? ſhal tribulation
or anguyſhe? eyther

perſecution? or hunger? or nakednes,
or perill or ſworde? As
it is wrytten. Beholde we are
kylled continuallye, that is to
wete: we are counted as ſheepe
apoynted to the ſlaughter. But
yet in al theſe thinges we haue
the victorye, through hym that
loued vs. For I am ſure, that
neyther death, nor lyfe, neither
Aungel, nor principate, nor power,
neither preſent thynges,
nor thynges to come,Tvvoo vvorldes, one vvher of Chriſte ſaieth, ſo hath God loued the vvorlde. &c. The other vvhereof he ſaith, I pray not for the vvoorlde. &c. neyther
heyght nor loweth, nor anye other
creature, ſhalbe able to ſeperate
vs from the loue of god,
whiche is in Chriſte Ieſus our
Lorde.
               This loue being ſpread abrode
by the holy ghoſt, hath brought
to paſſe, that the worlde of the
faythfull ſhoulde ouercome the
world of the wicked. This loue

hath confunded the crueltie of
Nero, the fury of Domicianus, and
of many Rulers after them, by
the glorious ende of innumerable
martyrs. Chryſt geuyng vnto
them yt folowe hym, thorow
the perſecution of Kinges, the
crownes of euerlaſting reward.
            
            
               ¶The .vi. Chapiter.
               
                  THerefore there is no
cauſe to doubt, but
that Ieſus Chryſte
oure Lorde dyed for
wicked men and ſinners,
whoſe number are found
in the boke. And died not Chriſt
for all men then? yes no doubt,
for all men dyed Chryſte. For
afore the reconciliation and attonement
that was made by
Chryſt, there was not one man
that was not eyther a ſinner or

elles vngodlye, as the Apoſtle
ſayeth.Rom. 5. For yf when as yet we
were weake accordynge to the
time, Chryſt dyed for vs whiche
were vngodly, for ſcarce wyll a
man dye for a ryghteous man:
yet peraduenture for a good mā
durſt a man dye. But God ſetteth
forth his loue towards vs,
ſeeynge that when we were yet
ſinners, Chriſt died for vs: much
more now ſeing we are reconciled,
ſhal we be ſafe through hys
life. And ye ſame Apoſtle in the
ſeconde to the Corin. ſaith. For
the loue of god compelleth vs to
thinke thus,1. Cor. 5. yf one bee dead for
al, that thē al are dead: & he died
for al, yt they which liue, ſhould
not henceforth lyue vnto them
ſelues, but to him that dyed for
them and aroſe agayne. But
lette vs heare what he pronounceth

of hym ſelfe, ſaying:
This is a true ſaying,1. Timo. 1. and of al
mē worthy to be receiued, that
Iheſus Chriſte came into this
world to ſaue ſinners, of whom
I am the chiefe: but therefore
dyd I obteyne mercye, that Ieſus
Chriſt ſhoulde firſt ſhew on
me all long pacience, vnto the
example of them which ſhould
beleue in hym vnto eternall
life. Therefore, whether they
were circumciſed or vncircumciſed,
they were concluded all
vnder ſinne, and one guylte or
treſpaſſe hath tyed or bound al
men: and ther was none, whether
theyr guylte were more or
leſſe, whiche without the redemption
of Chriſt could be ſaued:
whiche redemption came
freely into all the worlde, & appeered
to all men indifferently:

Foraſmuche as on the fiftieth
daye from that Eaſter wherein
the true lambe offred hym ſelfe
a ſacrifice to GOD, when the
Apoſtles and they which were
of one mynde with them, being
full of the holy ghoſt, ſpake in
the tongues of all nacions. A
greate multitude of men of dyuers
Nacions, beynge moued
with the miracle, came together,
that in thē that were preſent,
al the whole world might
heare the Goſpell of Chriſte.
               For there came together (as it
is wrytten) the Parthians and
Medyans,Actes. 2. the Elamytes, and
they that dwell in Meſopotamia,
men of Iurye, of Cappadocia,
Pontus, and Aſia, Phrigia,
and Pamphilia, of Egipte
and the parties of Libia which
is about Ciren, and ſtraungers

of Rome, Iewes alſo and Procelites,
Creteans and Arabians,
hearyng the great workes
of god to be preached of in their
owne tongues: Whoſe teſtimonie
alſo myght ren foorth both
in length & breadth vnto thoſe
nacions whiche were farther
beyonde them. To theffect and
woorkyng whereof, we beleue
that the Romaine kyngedome
was enlarged through goddes
prouidence, that the Nacions
whiche ſhoulde be called to the
vnitie of the bodye of Chryſte,
myght firſte be aſſociated together
vnder one vngodly power.
Howebeit, the grace of Chryſte
hath not bene contented to
haue thoſe ſame limittes that
the Romaine kingdome hadde:
For it hath ſubdued at this
tyme with the ſcepter of the

Croſſe of Chriſte, manye nacions
of people, whom the other
ouercame not with feates of
armes. Who alſo is made more
amplye by the gouernaunce of
the Apoſtolicall prieſtehood, in
the tower of Religion, then
by the ſeate of power. For peraduenture
lyke as we knowe
certeyne Nacions to be nowe
adopted into the felowſhyp of
the chyldren of GOD, whiche
thynge they once deſired not:
Euen ſo now there are certeine
Nacions in the vttermoſt partes
of the worlde, on whom the
grace of our Sauiour hath not
yet ſhone. And we doubte not
alſo concernynge them, but
that in the ſecrete iudgemente
of GOD, the tyme of theyr
vocation and callynge is appoynted,
wherein they maye

may heare and receiue the Goſpell,
the whiche they haue not
yet ſeene: To whom yet that
meaſure of the generall helpe,
which from aboue is alway geuen
to all men, is not denyed.
Though mans nature be woū
                  ded
with ſo greuous a wound,
that voluntary contemplacion
and beholding is not able fully
to enſtructe anye man in the
knowledge of God, excepte the
true lyght do firſt driue awaye
the darkeneſſe of the harte, the
which knowledge the iuſte and
good God of his vnſearcheable
iudgement hath not ſo plenteouſlye
ſpread abrode in tymes
paſte, lyke as he hath done in
theſe laſt dayes: Wherof the Apoſtle
Paule,Colloſſ. 1. wrytynge to the
Colloſſians, calleth it the miſterye
whiche was hydde from

worldes and generations: but
nowe is declared vnto his ſaintes,
to whom God would make
knowen the richeſſe of this glorious
ſecrete, among the gentyles,
which is Chriſt in vs.
            
            
               ¶The .vii. Chapter.
               
                  WAs this miſterie
alſo vnknowen
vnto the Prophetes?
And did
not thei by whō
the holye ghoſte
did ſpeake, know thoſe thinges
wherof they ſpake? I thynke
playnely it maye not ſo be vnderſtand,
but that that miſtery
was hydde from the Gentyles,
which the Lord reuealed when
he wold and to whom he wold.
For of the callyng of the Gentyles,

the whiche were not the
people of God, and on whom
aforetyme he had not mercy, it
is thus ſayde in the Deuteronomie:Deute. 32.
And the Lorde ſawe it,
and he waxed zelous, and he
was wroth ouer his ſonnes &
doughters, and he ſayd. I wyl
tourne away my face from thē,
and I wyll ſhewe them what
theyr ende ſhalbe. For it is a
frowarde generation, chyldren
in whō there is no fayth. They
haue angred me with that whiche
is no God, and prouoked
me with theyr vanities. And I
alſo wyll prouoke them with
thoſe which are no people, with
a foolyſhe nacion wyll I anger
them. And Dauid foretelleth
theſe thinges, that all nacions
ſhall worſhip God,pſalm. 85. ſaying: All
the Nacions whom thou haſte

made ſhall come and worſhippe
before thee oh Lorde, and ſhall
glorifie thy name. And agayne
he ſaith:Pſalm. 71. All the kynges of the
earth ſhall worſhippe hym, and
all nacions ſhal ſerue him. And
agayne: In hym ſhall all the
linredes of the earth be bleſſed,
and all nacions ſhall magnifie
him. Eſayas alſo ſheweth the
lyke thynges,Eſay. 2. ſaying: And it
ſhall come to paſſe in the laſte
dayes, that the hyll of the Lord
ſhalbe manifeſt, and the houſe
of God vppon the toppe of the
mountaynes, and it ſhalbe exalted
aboue al lytle hylles, and
all nacions ſhall come vnto it.
And agayne he ſayth: And the
Lorde of Sabaoth ſhall bryng
to paſſe (ſaith he) that all Nacions
ſhall dryncke wyne vppon
this hyll with gladdeneſſe

& reioyſing. In this hyll
ſhall they be annoynted with
oyntment, he ſhall geue al theſe
thinges to the gentyls, for this
is his deuiſe vppon all the gentyles.
And againe he ſaith: And
the Lorde ſhall ſhewe his holye
arme in the ſyght of al the gentyles,
and al the Nacions of the
earth ſhall ſee the ſaluacion
which is of the Lorde. And agayne:
Beholde, ſtrangers ſhal
by me come vnto thee, and ſhall
flie vnto thee. And afterward:
The nacions whiche haue not
knowen thee ſhall call vpon
the, and the people which were
ignoraunt of thee, ſhall flie vnto
thee. Oſeas alſo prophecieth
the lyke thynges, ſaying: And
it ſhal come to paſſe,Oſce. 1. that in the
place wherin it was ſayd vnto
them: Ye are not my people,

there ſhal they be called the chil
dren of the lyuynge God.Oſee. 2. And
the chyldren of Iudah and the
chyldren of Iſraell ſhall be gathered
togéther into one. And
agayne: I wyll haue mercy on
her that was not beloued, and
I wyl ſay to them that are not
my people: Thou arte my people,
and they ſhall ſaye: Thou
art my God. And in the Apopoſtles
times, when they which
were of the circumciſion & beleued
in Chriſt, dyd thinke that
they which were Gentyles and
were called Preputians or fore
ſkynned, coulde not be parttakers
of the iuſtyfyíng of grace:
The bleſſed Apoſtle Peter teacheth
howe inſeperable bothe
thoſe people are with God, yf
both of thē come together into
the vnitie of fayth. Aſſone as I

began to ſpeake (ſaith he) the
holy ghoſt fel vpon them, as he
dyd vpon vs in the beginnyng.
And I remembred the worde of
the Lorde, howe he ſayde: Iohn
verelye baptized you with water,
but ye ſhalbe baptized with
the holy ghoſt. Therfore if God
haue geuen them lyke grace as
he hath done vnto vs whicheActe. 11.
haue beleued in the Lorde Ieſus
Chriſt, who was I, that I
ſhoulde haue withſtande God?
When they heard theſe thinges
they helde theyr peace, and glorified
God, ſaying: Then hath
God geuen vnto the Gentyles
alſo repentaunce vnto lyfe.
               Iames the Apoſtle alſo of this
callyng of the Gentyles, ſaith:
Ye men & brethren, harken vnto
me,Actes. 15. Simon hath ſhe wed you
how God at the begynning did

viſite the Gentyles, & receiued
of thē a people vnto his name.
And vnto this agreeth the wordes
of the Prophetes: as it is
wrytten. After theſe thynges
wyll I retourne, and wyll
buylde agayne the Tabernacle
of Dauio whiche was fallenAmos. 9.
downe, and that that was fallen
in decaye thereof, wyll I
buylde agayne, and wyll ſet it
vp, that the reſidue of menne
myght ſeeke after the Lorde, &
alſo all the Gentyles vppon
whō my name is named (ſaith
the Lorde) that doeth theſe
thinges knowen vnto the lord,
is his owne woorke from the
beginnyng of the worlde. Simeon
alſo, euen he whiche had
receiued an aunſwere of the
holye ghoſte, that he ſhoulde
not taſte of death, vntyll

he had ſeene the Lordes Chriſt:
ſpake theſe woordes of the ſaluacion
of all Nacions, whiche
ſaluaciō was reueled in Chriſt:
Nowe Lorde let thy ſeruaunte
departe in peace, accordyng to
thy worde. For mine eyes haue
ſeene thy ſaluaciō, which thou
haſt prepared before the face of
all people. A lyght to lyghten
the gentyles, and to be the glorye
of thy people Iſraell. In
theſe & other lyke teſtimonies
of the holy Scriptures it is vndoubtedlye
declared, that this
moſt ryche, moſt myghtye, and
moſt benigne grace wherby all
nacions in the laſte ende of the
worlde are called into the kingdome
of Chriſt, was hyd in the
ſecrete counſell of GOD in the
former ages: And why it was
not made knowen in time paſt

by the ſame manifeſtacion that
it is nowe made knowen to all
naciōs, can no knowledge comhende,
nor no vnderſtandynge
perceiue. Yet notwithſtanding
that which moſte godly is beleued
of the goodneſſe of GOD,
howe that he wylleth all men
to be ſaued, and to come to the
knowledge of the truth, ought
to be iudged to be perpetuall &
euerlaſtyng, accordyng to the
meaſures whereby God knoweth
howe to heape his ſpeciall
vppon generall gyftes: That
both they which haue bē without
grace might be reproued of
their wickednes: and alſo that
they which haue ſhyned in his
lyght myght glory and reioyce,
not in theyr owne merite, but
in the Lord. And in this ſtreite,
but yet the right path of vnderſtandyng,

the conſideracion of
yonge Infantes doth ſet forth
vnto vs no ſmall difficultie:
which Infantes haue not the
iudgement of reaſon, whereby
they feelynge the benefite of
theyr maker, might come to the
knowledge of the trueth. Neyther
doth it ſeme that they can
be iuſtly reproued, for that they
haue neglected the grace that
ſhoulde haue holpen them: ſeing
that they were naturallye
brought foorth in that ignoraunce,
which no doubte receiueth
no knowledge nor perceiueth
any doctrine.
            
            
               ¶The .viii. Chapter.
               
                  WHerfore, foraſmuch
as God wylleth all
menne to be ſaued:
what is the matter

that ſo greate a multitude of
Infantes are alienated from
euerlaſtynge ſaluation, and
ſo many thouſandes of menne
in theſe dayes are left without
eternall lyfe, as though he had
made them for that purpoſe
onlye, which created no man of
euyl wyll? ſo that becauſe they
came into this worlde with the
fleſhe of ſinne, they ſhould fall
into the bandes of vnlooſeable
treſpaſſe without the gyltineſſe
of theyr owne acte. What can
be more deeper then this? what
can be more marueylous then
this? And lawfull is it not to
beleue that they whiche haue
not obteyned the Sacrament
of regeneration, do perteyne
vnto anye felowwyppe of the
bleſſed. And it is more to
bee wondered, and more to

to be maruayled at, that where
the act offendeth not, where the
wyll reſiſteth not, where there
is all one miſerie lyke weakeneſſe,
the cauſe common, and al
one, that the iudge is not all
one in ſo great a lykeneſſe: and
ſuch as repulſiō refuſeth, euen
ſuche doth the election adopte
and take. Howbeit our hartes
ſhal not be troubled about this
depth of gods ſeperation, if we
beleue with a firme and ſtedfaſt
fayth that all gods iudgement
is iuſt, & do not deſyre to know
that thyng that he would haue
ſecrete. So that when a man
can not fynde out whye he ſo
iudgeth, it maye ſuffice hym to
knowe who it is that iudgeth.
Albeit this queſtion is not ſo
farre paſt knowlege, that there
ſhoulde be no inſtruction at all
that can be learned concerning

it, yf the quiete looke of a ſober
harte be applyed to beholde the
thyng that maye be ſeene. For
when we do conſider, amonge
the Pagans, among the Iewes
among the Heretickes, and among
them that are Catholike
Chriſtians, howe great a number
of Infantes doeth peryſhe?
who (ſo farre foorth as perteyneth
to theyr proper wylles) we
are ſure haue done neither good
nor badde. We learne that the
ſame ſentence abydeth vppon
them, which mankind receiued
for the tranſgreſſion of our firſt
parent: the rigour of whiche
ſentence, whyle it is not reſolued
toward ſuch, it is declared
howe great that ſinne was.
               And it ſhoulde be iudged that
euery man were borne innocent,
excepte it ſhould be hurtefull

to ſuche, not to be borne againe.
And as touching the vntimelineſſe
of death, there is no
reaſon why to complaine of it,
ſeyng that death & mortalitie
being once entred into our nature
through ſin, hath brought
in bondage to it, euē euery day
of our lyfe.If chvldrē vver born vvithout ſinne, thē could thei not dye, but vvere after a certeine maner immortall. For it ſhuld come to
paſſe, that after a certeyne maner
a man myght be called immortall,
yf there were a tyme
within the which he could not
dye. But corruptiō is neuer on
ſuch wyſe partaker of incorruption,
that it ſhuld not alway be
bounde vnto the defection that
is due to the fall or tranſgreſſion.
The begynnyng of this life
is the begynnyng to dye, and
our age begynneth not to bee
increaſed, before it begin to be
diminiſhed: Wherunto yf anye

temporarie ſpace be added, it is
not added to thend it ſhould endure,
but it paſſeth away to the
end it ſhuld peryſhe & be gone.
Therfore that which is mortal
frō the beginning, what day ſo
euer it dye, it dyeth not cōtrary
to the lawe of mortalitie: Neither
haue they at any tyme power
to liue, any nyer then they
haue power to die. And though
the mortalitie of al mē is come
of one cauſe, yet corruptible nature
is drawē, not into one only,
but into manyfold imbecilities:
& not only the yeres, monthes
or dayes of mās tyme, but
alſo al houres & momentes, are
ſubiect either to diſeaſes, debilities
or hurts: nether is ther ani
kind of death or any way to die
but it chaūceth into ſom portiō
of the generalitie of mortal mē.

For there remayneth an heauy
yoke vppon all the chyldren of
Adam, from the daye that they
come foorth of theyr mothers
wombe, vntyll the day of theyr
buryall agayne into the earth,
which is the mother of al thinges.
But the weyght of this
moſte ſharpe yoke hath not in
ſuch wyſe fallen vpon the chyldren
of Adam, that the Iuſtice
of God myght not worke anye
part of his moderation therin.
The whiche hath ſo ſubdued
thinges tranſitory and fayling
vnto the lawes of defectiō, that
he wold not take away frō thē
the power of his moderacions:
Or els all euyls ſhoulde fall vppon
all men, becauſe that by
common condicion, all menne
ſhoulde be ſubiecte to them all.
But that the general neceſſitie

being variated and made dyuers,
the Lorde myght reſerue
vnto hym ſelfe the cauſes both
of theyr pardon, & alſo of theyr
puniſhment: and that it might
be in one to whom all men are
bounde, both mercifully to remitte,
and iuſtelye to requite.
Seyng then that the iuſte and
almyghtie prouidence of God
doeth without ceaſſyng iudge
and diſcerne all thynges, and
that no mā can come into this
worlde nor departe out of this
worlde, but by the ſame entraunce
and departyng, which
the ruler of thynges accordyng
to his moſte hyghe knowledge
and wyſdome doeth appoynte,
(as it is wrytten in the booke
of Iob:) Who knoweth not
that the hand of the Lord hath
done al theſe thinges, in whoſe

power is the ſoule of euery lyuyng
thyng, and the ſpirite of
all the fleſhe of man?
               And againe he ſaith:Iob. 14. The daies
of man are but ſhorte, and the
nombre of his monethes are
with thee. Who dare ſearch out
the cauſes of his woorkes and
deuiſes? For it is vnſercheable
and wonderful ſecrete why the
ſtate and condicion of man is
variated with ſo great differences.
Continuall ſyckeneſſe
greeueth one manne from his
chyldehood to his age, and yet
doeth not the tyme of his appointed
age fayle among thoſe
continuall ſorowes. Another
man hath great ſtrength when
he is olde, and a lyuely power
quickeneth hym in a valeaunt
courage. One endeth his dayes
in his chyldhod, another when

he is come to mans ſtate. One
can not liue paſt his youth: To
another it is poſſible to lyue ſo
long tyll his ſpeache fayle hym
lyke a chyld. The which bondes
and limittes of lyfe beyng ſundry
wayes vnequall, this tranſitorie
mortalitie ſhoulde fynde
the leſſe bytter, yf it myght ſuffer
but the detriment of this
preſente worlde onely, and yf
they whiche departed hence
without the lauer of regeneration
myght not fall into euerlaſtyng
miſeries. But foraſmuch
as the cauſe of the giftes
which grace hath geuen is vnſearcheable,
aſwell as the
cauſe of miſerie whiche nature
hath deſerued, all one, and the
ſame difficultie and hardneſſe
of the vnderſtandynge thereof,
ſendeth vs backe agayne

vnto our authour: And when
we aſke howe he wylleth al mē
to be ſaued, whiche geueth not
vnto all men the tyme wherein
they maye be able to receiue
grace apprehended by voluntarye
fayth: I thynke it not vngodly
to be belened, nor vnconuenientlye
to be vnderſtande,Not to the adoptiō of the eſpeciall grace.
that theſe men of few dayes or
ſhorte tyme, do appertayne to
that part of grace whiche is alwaye
geuen vnto all Nacions.
The which grace doubtleſſe, yf
theyr parentes had vſed well,
they alſo hadde ben holpen by
them. For the ſpryngyng vp of
all Infantes, and all thoſe begynnynges
of infancie beynge
without reaſon, lieth vnder the
arbitrement of anothers wyll,
neyther cā they by any meanes
be holpen but by other menne.

And ſo it foloweth, that they
perteyne to thoſe of whoſe eyther
ryght or wronge affection
they are gouerned. For lyke as☞
they beleue of another mans
confeſſion and fayth, ſo of another
mans infidelitie or diſſimulation
they beleue not. And
foraſmuch as they neyther had
deſire of this preſent lyfe, nor
yet of the lyfe to come: lyke as
theyr parentes are the cauſe
that they were firſte borne, ſo
are they the cauſe why they are
not regenerate & borne againe.
And lyke as touchynge the elders,
beſides the generall grace
that knocketh at the conſciences
of all men more ſclenderlye
and ſecretely, a ſpeciall grace is
ſet forth, with a more excellent
worke, a more large gyfte, and
myghtier woorkyng: Euen ſo

alſo the ſame election is playnly
declared concernynge innumerable
Infantes. The which
election doubteleſſe fayled not
them that were vnregenerate
in theyr parentes,He ſpeaketh of thoſe that come to baptiſme before their parentes be baptized. but was preſent
with them which are regenerate
before theyr parentes:
So that the diligence of ſtrangers
hath oftentymes ſerued
many Infantes, whom the vngodlyneſſe
of theyr owne parentes
haue forſaken, and they
haue come to regeneration by
ſtrangers, which was not prouided
for them by theyr owne
nexte friendes. In the whiche
worke of grace, who (except he
be to arrogant & moſt foolyſhe)
dare complaine of gods iuſtice,
that the lyke prouidence doeth
not helpe all Infantes: & that
it doth not eyther by power remoue

and put awaye, or els by
mercy preuent all perylles and
ieopardies that myght lette or
ſtoppe the regeneraciō of them
which ſhall dye? Whiche thyng
doubtleſſe ſhuld ſo come to paſſe
vpon al, if it ought ſo vtterly to
be done. But it is not vnknowen
howe muche ſlouchfulneſſe
ſhould be engendred in the hartes
of the faythfull, yf in the
baptizing of infantes nothing
were to be feared touching any
mans negligence, or nothynge
touchyng the mortalitie of the
chyldren: for it were not poſſible
to chaunce by anye meane,
that ſuch ſhuld be without baptiſme.
And in this felicitie of
Infantes, ſo vnable to be loſt, ye
opinion of that errour ſhuld be
ſtrongly mainteined, which dareth
affirme contrary to the catholike
faith, yt the grace of god

is geuen accordyng to the merites
of men.They acknovvelege none adoption, that confeſſe no guylt to conſtraine them. For it ſhould ſeme
to be due by all equitie to fautleſſe
innocentie, that adoption
ſhould ouerpaſſe none of them,
whom no gyft dyd conſtrayne.
Neyther hadde it ben vngodly
ſpoken of a certeyne man touchyng
the baptiſme of Infantes:Pelagius.
that grace hath that it
may adoptate, but water hath
not what to waſhe of or put awaye.
But all the diſciples of
the trueth, do knowe this to be
deteſtably ſpoken. And hereby
it is manifeſt, that they whiche
are ſaued, are ſaued not by merite,
but by grace. For it is no
doubt, but that they which dye
without baptiſm are peryſhed:
who doubtleſſe, except they had
ben partakers of moſt greuous
ſinne, ſhoulde not peryſhe. But

not it is declared on this wiſe
by the ſecrete diſtribution or
difference makyng of God, yet
beyng iuſte, both what grace
can geue, and alſo what ſinfull
nature can deſerue: to the ende
that neyther pryde ſhoulde be
lyfted vp agaynſte the gyfte,
nor diligence ſhoulde ceaſe agaynſt
peryll. Therefore, whether
we conſider the laſt times,
the firſt or the middel, it is both
reaſonable and godly to be beleued,
that God wylleth al men
to be ſaued, & euermore wolde:
and this is declared none other
wyſe then by thoſe benefites, &
that ſame prouidence of God,
which he commonly and indifferently
geueth vnto all generations.
For ſuche maner of
gyftes haue ben & are ſo generall,
that by the teſtimonies of

them, men myght be holpen to
ſeeke the true Godde: with the
whiche giftes proteſtyng theyr
auctoritie throughout al worldes,
the aboundaunce of a ſpeciall
grace was powred foorth.
Which grace, although it be geuen
forth now more plentifully
then it hath ben aforetime: yet
hath god reſerued the cauſes of
his owne diſtributions thereof
within his owne knowledge, &
hath hydde them within the ſecrete
place of his moſt myghtie
wyll: which ſhoulde not be vnknowen,
yf they were geuen in
one vniforme maner vnto all
men. And foraſmuch as there
is no more ambiguitie or doubt
of the generall benignitie of
God, then there is of his ſpecial
mercy: there ſhould be nothing
that ſhould cauſe vs to wonder

as though the one were grace
and the other no grace. But it
hath pleaſed God to geue the
one to manye men, and to pull
awaye the other from no man,
that it myght appeere on both
partes, that that thyng which
was geuen to the porcion of
menne, was not denyed to all:
but yet in ſome, grace to haue
preuayled, and in other ſome,
nature to haue ſtart backward.
For we ſo beleue this more aboundant
grace,Goddes grace vvorketh not violence, but amendeth the vvyll of man, vvherby man becommeth vvyllyng. and haue experience
of her power, that we
in no wyſe thynke it to be violent:
that whatſoeuer is done
in the buſineſſe of mans ſaluacion,
ſhould be done by the only
wyll of God, when the very infantes
are holpen by the ſeruice
and diligence of another
myns wyll.
            
            
               
               ¶The .ix. Chapter.
               
                  DOubteleſſe it is
the grace of god
that hath ye preeminence
principally
in al iuſtificatiōs,
in councellyng
by exhortaciōs, in warnyng
by examples, in fearyng
by perylles, in ſtirryng vp by
miracles, in geuyng of vnderſtandyng,
in enſpiring of counſell,
and in illumining the hart
it ſelf, and inſtructing with the
affections of faith. The wyll of
man is alſo added and coupled
vnto it, the which is moued &
ſtirred vp by ye aforeſaid helpes
vnto this ende, namely that it
maye worke with the worke of
God in them ſelues, and begyn

to practiſe to merite, that which
it conceyued to deſyre by the
heauenly ſeede: hauynge of hys
owne mutabilitie if he fal, and
of the ayde of grace if he profite
and go forwarde, whiche helpe
is geuen to all men by innumerable
meanes, eyther priuie or
manifeſt: and that it is refuſed
of many, is of theyr owne wyckednes,
but that it is receyued
of many, commeth both of the
grace of God, and alſo of mans
wyll.
               Therefore whether we conſider
the beginninges, eyther the
profytinges and encreaſynges
of the faythfull, or els the kinde
of menne which perſeuer vnto
the ende, no kynde of anye vertue
meteth vs or commeth to
hande, whiche may bee had eyther
without the helpe of Gods

grace, or elles without the conſent
of oure wyll. For grace it
ſelfe worketh this by all kynde
of medicine and helpynge: that
in hym whom ſhe calleth, ſhe
might prepare his wil to be the
fyrſt receyuer of her, and the
handmayden of her gyftes. For
there is no vertue in them that
are not wyllynge, neyther can
fayth, or hope, or charitie be affyrmed
to bee in them, whiche
are without a good conſent to
the ſame thinges. And this conſent,
not only the exhortacions
of preachers, and the ſtirringes
of doctrine, but alſo feare doth
engender and breede, wherefore
it is wrytten: The feare of the
Lord, is the beginning of wiſedome.
The which in how great
feare ſo euer a man be brought,
doth none other thing but that

it maketh him willinge, whom
it made fearinge, and not onely
willinge, but alſo wyſe. Whereof
alſo thys is wrytten:Eccle. 25. Bleſſed
is he to whom it is geuen to
haue the feare of God.
               For what thynge maketh a
manne ſo bleſſed, as thys feare,
whiche is the father and teacher
of wiſdome? In whoſe deuocion
doubtleſſe, the will alſo
is deuoute, the whiche by the
ſame aucthour of grace, profitteth
in the ſame feare wherein
it begonne. Therefore when as
thys feare is putte in a man by
a certayne power of great terroure,
reaſon is not thereby
extynct, nor vnderſtandynge
taken awaye, but rather that
darkeneſſe whiche dyd oppreſſe
the mynde is dryuen awaye:
that the wyl which before was

deprauate and captiue, myght
be made right and free.
               Wherfore, lyke as the mynde
apprehendeth no vertue, onleſſe
it receyue a beame of the true
lyght: Euen ſo grace doth conferre
and geue nothinge to him
whom ſhe calleth, excepte ſhe open
in him the eyes of his will.
The which in many men (as I
haue afore diſputed) beynge in
the beginninge of it, moſte ardent
and feruent, is enryched
with ſpedye aud great increaſinges.
But in other ſome, profittinge
more ſlowly, and by litle
and lytle, is ſcarce aduaunced
vnto thoſe increaſynges
whiche haue conuenient firmitie
or ſtrength to perſeuer. For
the Lorde ſayeth:Iohn. 6. No man commeth
to me, excepte the father
whiche ſent me do drawe hym.

Bnt that is ſpoken becauſe we
ſhoulde knowe, that that faith,
without the whiche no manne
commeth vnto Chryſte, is the
gift of the father, accordinge to
that whiche was ſayde to the
Apoſtle.Math. 16. Bleſſed art thou Symon
Bariona, for fleſhe and
bloud hath not reuealed thys
vnto thee, but my father which
is in heauen, whiche wrought
in the hartes of them that were
to be drawen, that they myght
beleue, and brought it to paſſe
that they myght wyl. For there
could be nothyng howe or why
they ſhoulde be drawen, yf they
were not folowers in faith and
in wyll: for they whiche beleue
not, are not drawen at all, neyther☜
do they come: neyther doe
ſuch as diſſent, approch or draw
nere, but they goe backwarde

and depart away.
               Therefore they whiche come,
are led by loue: for they beynge
loued fyrſt, haue loued agayne:
they haue bene ſought, & haue
ſought: and they haue wylled
that which GOD willed them
to wyll: whiche ſo geueth that
wyll of obedience vnto them,
that he taketh not awaye from
them that perſeuer, that mutabilitie
whiche maye nyll. For otherwyſe,
no faythfull manne
ſhould at any tyme haue departed
from the fayth. Concupiſcence
& vncleane deſyre ſhould
ouercome no manne, heuineſſe
ſhuld hurt no man, anger ſhuld
ouercome no man: No mannes
charitie ſhoulde waxe colde, no
mans pacience ſhoulde be broken,
and no man ſhoulde neglecte
grace beynge geuen vnto

him. But nowe, becauſe theſe
thynges may come to paſſe, and
becauſe there is an eaſie and a
ſteepe diſcendynge downe into
the conſent of ſuche temptacions:
That ſayinge of the Lorde
ought alwaye to ſounde in the
eares of the faythfull, wherein
it is ſayd to the Apoſtles, watch
and pray, leaſt ye fal into temptacion.Math. 26.
Where if he had warned
the Diſciples to watche onely,
and not alſo to praye, he ſhould
haue ſeemed to haue exhorted
the onelye power of free wyll.
But when he added: And pray,
he ſufficientlye taught them
that it ſhoulde bee geuen them
from aboue, that the ſtorme of
temptacion ſhoulde not ouercome
them whyle they watched.
               
                  
And the lyke is it that he ſayth:Luke. 22.
Simon Simon, beholde Sathan
hath deſyred to ſift you as
it were wheate, but I haue
prayed for thee that thy fayth
fayle not, and thou at length
when thou art conuerted, ſtrēgthen
thy brethen. And pray leſt
ye fal into temptacion. Yf then
the fayth of ſo great an Apoſtle
ſhould haue failed, except Chriſt
had prayed for him: doubtleſſe
then was ther mutabilitie and
chaungeablenes in him, which
in temptacion myght wauer.
And he was not nowe made ſo
ſtronge in vertue of perſeueraunce,
that he ſhoulde bee ſubiect
to no perill at all: for after
theſe things, ſo great a perturbation
ſmote him, that beynge
in the houſe of Caiphas, he was
ſo afrayde at the queſtion of a

wenche, that (hys conſtancye
quite fayled) he was brought to
the poynt, that he thriſe denyed
Chryſt, with whom he had promyſed
to dye. Then he whiche
beheld the troubled heart of the
Apoſtle, not with humaine, but
with deuyne eyes, and ſtirred
hym by a myghtye looke vnto
aboundaunte teares of repentaunce,
was able, and coulde
haue geuen vnto hys chiefe diſciple,
that ſtedfaſtnes of minde.
That lyke as nothynge feared
the lord him ſelfe from his purpoſe
to perfourme hys paſſion:
So ſhould not any feare at that
tyme, haue ouercommed bleſſed
Peter. But thys ſtabilitie was
onely proper vnto him, whiche
onely truly and mightely ſayd:
I haue power to put away my
lyfe, and I haue power to take

it agayne.Iohn. 10. But in other men, ſo
longe as the fleſhe luſteth contrary
to the ſpirite, and the ſpirite
contrary to the fleſhe, and
ſo longe as the ſpirite is willinge,
but the fleſhe weake, the
immutable feare of mynde can
not bee founde, for perfect and
ſecure felicitie is not hadde in
this life, but in the life to come.
And in the vncertaintie of thys
preſent conflicte and battayle,If any mā gette any victorie, then is pride the daunger.
neyther is victory it ſelf in ſafegard
frō pryde lying in wayte,
nor without daunger of mutabilitie.
And though Goddes deuine
protection and fauoure do
geue vnto innumerable hys
ſainctes power to perſeuer and
continue to the ende, yet taketh
he from none of them, that that
repugneth againſt themſelues,
whiche alſo is of them ſelues:

that in all theyr ſtudies and endeuoures,
euermore wyll and
nyll do ſtryue amonge themſelues.
The whiche fyght and
battaile, the ſaide bleſſed Peter
ſuffred euen in the ende of all
hys victories: for the lorde himſelfe
proteſted the ſame, when
he ſayd. Verely verely I ſay vnto
thee, when thou waſt yonge,
thou girdedſt thy ſelfe and walkedſt
whyther thou wouldeſt:
But when thou art olde,Iohn. 21. thou
ſhalt ſtretch forth thine hands,
and another ſhal girde thee, and
leade thee whyther thou wouldeſt
not. And thys he ſpake to
declare, by what death he ſhuld
glorifie GOD. Then who can
doubt, yea who can but knowe,
that thys moſte ſtronge rocke
which toke part both of vertue
& name of that principal rocke,

to haue had alwaye the deſyre,
that conſtancie might be geuen
hym to dye for Chryſtes ſake?
Notwithſtandyng the obluctacion
and ſtrugling of feare was
ſo vnable to bee auoyded, that
the man moſt gredie of marterdome,
was tolde aforehande,
that he ſhould obtayne the vyctorie
of paſſion and ſuffringe of
death, howebeit not without
the temptacion of feare. Therfore
not without good cauſe,
not onely the Sainctes whiche
are but beginners, but alſo thei
which are growen vp vnto the
moſte perfection do vniformely
beſeche the Lorde and ſaye.
               Leade vs not into temptacion,
but delyuer vs from euyll. For
vnto all them that abyde in
faith and in loue,Math. 6. it is geuen of
him that they be not ouercome

in temptacion, that he whiche
doth glory, ſhoulde glory in the
Lorde.1. Cor. 1. And yet doth he aſcribe
that ſame glorye vnto them
whom he geueth it vnto: that
though thei ſtande thorowe the
helpe of God, yet foraſmuch as
it laye in theyr owne power to
fall, it ſhould be theyr own merite
that they dyd ſtande. Therfore
like as thei which haue beleued,
are holpen yt they myght
abyde in the fayth:All our povver, vvithout grace, is eyther to, go backevvarde, or els not to come at al So they
whiche not yet beleued, are holpen
that they myght beleue.
               And lyke as the one ſorte haue
in their own power to go back,
ſo the other ſort haue in theyr
own power that thei come not.
And it is made manyfeſte, that
by dyuers and innumerable
meanes God wylleth al men to
bee ſaued, and to come to the

knowledge of the trueth: But
they whiche come, are guyded
and dyrected by the helpe of
god: and they whiche come not,
do ſtryue the contrarye in theyr
own ſtubburnes. And although
that manye men louynge their
owne darkneſſe, do not receyue
the brightnes of the truth, and
many which were once lyghtened,
do fall agayne into darkenes:
yet doth the worde of God
abyde for euer, and nothing falleth
awaye from the trueth of
his promyſe. The foreknowen
and promiſed fulnes of the gentiles
doth dayly enter in: and
in the ſeede of Abraham, all
nations, all tribes, and all
tongues are bleſſed: for that
which the father hath geuen to
the ſonne, the ſonne loſeth not:
neyther is anye manne able to

take oute of hys hande, that
whiche he hath receyued. The
foundation of GOD ſtandeth
ſtedfaſt and ſure, and the buyldynge
of the Temple that ſhall
endure for euer, wauereth not.
The truth and mercy of GOD
beynge ſtretched foorth vppon
all men, of whom that (whiche
is both denyed to no man, and
alſo is due to no manne) is perfectly
perfourmed and brought
to paſſe in them whom he hath
promyſed. For he worketh all
in all: but out of doubt it is all
iuſte thynges and good thynges.
For all the wayes of the
Lord are very mercy and faythfulneſſe.
               Who lyke as he knewe before al
worldes,Pſalm. 24. howe great a multitude
of mē of the whole world,

eyther vſing his cōmon gyftes,
or being holpen with his ſpeciall
aydes (but yet declining frō
the way of trueth & lyfe) ſhould
enter into the brode way of errour
and death: Euen ſo had
he alway in his foreknowledge
howe great a nomber of godlye
men, through the helpe of grace
and the ſeruice of obedience,
ſhoulde parteyne vnto euerlaſtyng
blyſſe: that none fallyng
awaye from the fulneſſe of the
nombre of promeſſe (who neyther
ſhoulde fayle of aduauncement,
nor be deſtitute of helpe)
he myght glorifie them before
all men, whom he hath choſen
out of all men. For the manyfolde
and vnſpekable goodneſſe
of GOD hath in ſuch ſorte alwayes
holpen and yet doeth
helpe the generall multitude of

men, (as we haue ſufficientlye
proued) that none of them whiche
periſhe haue ani excuſe that
the lyghte of the trueth hath
bene denyed hym, neyther hath
any man libertie to glori in his
owne ryghteouſnes, foraſmuch
as theyr owne wickednes wayeth
downe the one parte vnto
paine: and the grace of god conducteth
and bryngeth the other
part vnto glory.
            
            
               ¶The .x. Chapiter.
               
                  THerfore, that which
we haue declared in
the begynnynge of
this ſeconde booke,
the ſame do we now
commende agayne vnto youre
remembraunces, that when we
diſputed of the depth & height

of grace, we ſtayed vppon three
moſte wholſome and true diffinicions.
 Whereof the one profeſſeth,
that it commeth of the
eternall and proper wyl of god,
that he wylleth all men to bee
ſaued, and to come to the knowledge
of the trueth.
               
                   The other alſo teacheth that
euery man which is ſaued, and
whiche commeth to the knowledge
of the trueth is, holpen
and gouerned by the helpe of
god: and that he is therby kept,
that he myghte abyde in fayth
whiche worketh by loue.
               
                   And the thirde doth temperately
and ſoberly proteſt, that
all the reaſon of the wil of God
cannot bee comprehended, and
that there bee manye cauſes of
gods workes hydde from mans
vnderſtandynge: as when in

times, in nations, in families,
in Infantes, in them which are
not yet borne, & in them which
are vnbegotten, certayne thynges
are knowen to bee diuerſly
or notablye done, whiche we
doubte not but that they are of
thoſe thynges whiche the iuſte
& mercyful Lord wyld not that
they ſhoulde be knowen in this
tranſitorie worlde. The whiche
thinge we muſt thynke to be ſo
diſpoſed and ordered for our profite:
that foraſmuche as we are
ſaued, to whom god hath prepared
yt which ye eye hath not ſene,
the eare hath not heard neither
hath entred into ye hart of man,
like as we beleue conſtātly that
we ſhall ſee the thynges whiche
we yet ſee not, ſo ſhoulde we
pacientlye, looke to vnderſtande
the thinges which we do

not yet vnderſtande. Therefore
if craftie malice would ceaſe, yf
wanton preſumption would be
ſtill, theſe thinges beynge (as I
trowe) rightli handled: there remaineth
no more cauſe of ſtrife,
neyther nede we to be occupyed
in endeleſſe queſtions. For I
haue trauayled ſo farre foorth
as the Lorde hath helped me,
that it might bee proued, howe
that not onelye in the latter
times, but alſo in al times paſt,
the grace of God hath bene preſent
with all men, by lyke prouydence
and generall goodnes:
but by manyfolde and ſundrye
workinge, and alſo by dyuers
meaſures, for eyther priuily or
els manyfeſtly, he is (as the Apoſtle
ſayth) the Sauiour of all
men, but eſpecially of the faithfull.
The which ſentence beyng

of moſte fine briefnes, and moſt
valeaunt ſtrength, yf it be conſidered
with a quiet and calme
aſpect, doth ceaſe all thys controuerſie
that we ſpeake of. For
in that he ſayth, whiche is the
Sauiour of al men, he hath aſſured
vs that the goodneſſe of
God is generall vpon all men:
But in that he addeth eſpecyallye
of the faythfull, he ſheweth
that there is a part of mankind
whiche by the meryte of fayth
enſpyred by god, is promoted by
ſpecial benefites, vnto the moſt
high, excellent, and eternall ſaluation.
The which thing doubtleſſe
is done by no vnequitie of
the moſte iuſte and moſt mercyfull
GOD, whoſe iudgment in
theſe dyſpenſacions and orderinges,
is not to be iudged with
arrogancie, but is to be praiſed

with tremblyng: foraſmuch as
euen among thoſe faithful people
(as is aboueſayde) not one
and the ſame thinges, nor lyke
thynges are geuen to them all,
and before any part of mennes
merites, there is a moſte vnlike
meaſure of Gods giftes.
               For if we dare not complaine
of the iudgemente of oure carnall
parentes, when they doe
loue ſome of theyr Chyldren
more tenderly then the other, euen
afore any trial of their maners,
and before any ſeruyce of
godlines: And the affection and
diſpoſicion of mayſters is free
and at libertie towarde theyr
ſeruaunts: neyther is any man
iuſtly reprehended whiche hath
choſen to hymſelfe oute of hys
famyly and houſholde ſeruauntes,
beinge all in one condicion

and ſtate, ſome certayne ſeruauntes
whom he would more
louingly preferre and ſet forth,
and whom he would more liberalli
inſtruct: Shal we then cauyll
and complayne of the moſt
louynge equitie of the hygheſt
father and true Lorde, becauſe
that in hys greate houſe alſo,
thynges are made variable by
innumerable differences? And
when no man hath anye good
thynge that is not of his gyfte:
yet al men ſhine not in like vertues,
or are enriched with lyke
gyftes of the holy ghoſte. And
we may not apply this diuerſitie
of degrees vnto the cauſes
of merites, foraſmuche as the
principall cauſe of all good merite,
is grace: Of whoſe ryches
is receyued whatſoeuer thynge
is founde allowable in al men.

Therefore lyke as it is vngodly
to conceyue in the heart, anye
griefe of thoſe thynges, whiche
the holy ghoſte manye ſundrye
wayes worketh in the Church:
So alſo we muſt not murmure
at al at that prouidence that is
ouer the vnfaythfull.
               For the iudge is both iuſt and
good, neyther is he of an vnrighteous
wyll, nor yet of an
vncertayne diſcrecion, that we
ſhoulde thynke, whoſoeuer periſheth,
ought not to periſhe vnder
the great mercy and iuſtyce
of the almightie God. There is
no part of the worlde without
the Goſpel of Chriſt, and albeit
the generall callinge ceaſe not,
yet is that ſpeciall callyng alſo
become common to all menne.
For of euery nation, of euerye
condicion and ſtate of men are

daylye adopted thouſandes of
olde men, thouſandes of yonge
men, thouſandes of Chyldren:
And alſo thoſe inſtrumentes
and tyrauntes by whom the
worlde is tormoiled, do ſerue to
the effectes of ye Chriſtian grace.
For feare of preſent peryll hath
drawen many a one to the water
of regeneration, who in the
calme of peace did deferre to receyue
the Sacrament of Baptiſme:
and dreadfull feare hath
ſodainly conſtrayned that, whiche
quiet exhortation could not
in longe time beate into weake
and luke warme mynds. Some
Children of the Church, beyng
taken of theyr enemyes, haue
wonne theyr mayſters vnto the
Goſpel of Chriſt, and they were
aboue them in magiſterie and
dignitie of fayth, whom they

ſerued by courſe and condition
of warre. And ſome barbarous
men whyle they ayded the Romaynes,
haue learned in oure
countreys, that whiche they
coulde not know in their owne
countreys, and haue retourned
home to theyr owne abidinges
with the doctrine of the Chryſten
religion. So then, nothing
is able to reſiſt the diuine grace,
that the thynge that he hath
wylled, ſhoulde not be fulfilled,
when very diſcordes draw men
to vnitie, and plagues are tourned
into remedyes, that the
Churche might thereof receyue
increaſinge,He meaneth of perſecutiō
                   whereof it was affrayde
of ieopardie.
               Therfore let vs looke vnto al
the iſſues and ends of humaine
thinges, and we ſhal fynde that
no times, no buſines, no beginninges

nor endes of generations
wanted the eternall & vnſercheable
iudgementes of god.
All repugnauncie of variableneſſe,
al cauſes of vnlykely ſucceſſes,
which we are not able to
ſearche and diſcerne, were in
that eternall knowledge, both
knowen and deuided at once:
and nothyng was there vnordeyned
or vndiſpoſed, yea euen
of the qualities of the actions
which yet haue no beyng. For
in God there is no chaunſyng
motion or newe wyll, no temporall
counſell or mutable deuyce,
neyther is his thoughte
chaunged with the inequalitie
of mutable thynges, but he
comprehended at once and together
in an euerlaſtynge and
ſtable ſyghte or beholdynge, all
tymes and temporall thinges.

And he geueth all vnto al thinges,
who hath alreadi made the
thynges that ſhalbe hereafter.
And thys is it that the Apoſtle
Paule wrytteth to the Epheſi.
Bleſſed be god and the father of
our Lorde Ieſus Chryſt,Epheſ. 1. which
hath bleſſed vs with all maner
of ſpirituall bleſſynges in heauenly
thinges by Chryſt, according
as he had choſen vs in him
before the begynnynge of the
worlde, that we ſhoulde be holy
and immaculate in his ſight in
loue, whiche hath predeſtinate
vs vnto the adoption of ſonnes
by Ieſus Chryſt our Lorde, accordynge
to the purpoſe of hys
owne wyll, vnto the prayſe of
the glory of hys grace. &c. The
which he knitteth together vnder
the predication of the ſame
ſence, teachinge that the gyfte

and workynge of grace, hath euermore
remained and abidden
in the euerlaſtinge counſaile of
God, and that all the Children
of adoption were elected, not
onely in that time wherin they
were called nowe being, but alſo
before the worlde was made.
In the whiche election, what
man ſo euer was not foreknowē
in Chriſt, ſhal by no meanes
bee aſſociated or ioyned vnto
him. For al the men which ſhal
come into the kingdome of god,
by the calling of any time, were
ſealed into the ſame adoption
that went before all worldes.
               And lyke as no vnbeleuer is
numbred in thys ſorte: euen ſo
no godlye man is deuyded from
this ſort. For the forknowledge
of God which cannot be deceaued,
loſeth nothinge of the fulnes

of the membres of Chriſtes
body: & the foreknowen nomber
and preelected in Chriſt before
all worldes, can not be miniſhed
by anye hyndraunce or
daunger.2. Tim. 6 Lyke as the Apoſtle
wrytyng to Timotheus, ſayth:
Labour thou in the Goſpel accordyng
to the power that God
hath geuen thee, whiche hath
delyuered vs, & called vs with
an holy calling: not accordyng
to our workes, but accordyng
to his owne purpoſe and grace,
the which grace was geuen vs
in Chriſt Ieſu before al worlds
               Agaynſte this mooſte bryght
light of inuincible verite, ſome
men are wont vndiſcretely to
ſpeake, ſaying that it is ſuperfluous
and but loſte labour to
go about to get the merites of
good workes: that it is in vain

alſo to cōtinue in prayer, wherby
we hope that God is intreated,
yf election do depende vpon
the vnchaungeable purpoſe of
the grace of Chriſte, nor yf nothyng
can go forwarde or proceade
otherwyſe then is alredy
diſpoſed by the wil of him that
is almyghtye. But thoſe men
which thinke that they do wittyly
make this obiectiō, do not
vnderſtande nor conſider that
the knowlege of God which cō
                  prehendeth
both thynges that
are paſte, thinges that are preſent,
& things that are to come,
is not bound to any tyme. And
that thoſe things which are yet
to be done are aſwel preſente in
his ſight, as the things whiche
are at this preſēt time a doing,
or which haue bē done in tyme
paſte. The which thing foraſmuche

as it is moſte true, that
power nedeth no leaſure to ſee
and diſcerne, whiche beholdeth
at once & together in an euerlaſtynge
and moſte true ſyght,
both thinges created, and thinges
to bee created, thynges begon,
and thynges to bee begon,
thynges whiche are done, and
thinges which hereafter ſhalbe
done: and whatſoeuer in the generalitie
of thynges is paſte by
tymes afore determined, and is
declared bi manifolde varieties
and diuerſities: all that ſame
doth it comprehend euen nowe,
in the ſame order, whiche the
ende of thys world ſhal receiue,
in that moſte hygh and perfect
iudgment. And this euerlaſting
and euermore quiet knowledge
doth not conſtrayne vs to ſinne
by anye neceſſitie: neyther doth

anye wyckedneſſe come of the
thinge wherof commeth rightouſnes.
For foraſmuch as God
being good, hath made al thynges
good, and ther is none euyl
at all in nature. Wylfull tranſgreſſion
ſpronge of free wylles,
(the whiche willes to bee made
free, was alſo good), and mutable
nature, whoſe ſafegarde dependeth
vppon the immutable
eſſence, deuided it ſelfe from the
higheſt goodnes, when it peruerſlye
delyted in hys owne,
which ruine nowe, the grace of
GOD doth heale: and for thys
cauſe came Ieſus Chryſte into
thys world,1. I
                        〈…〉
                     
                   euen that he might
deſtroy the workes of the deuil,
whiche doubtleſſe are in ſuche
wyſe deſtroyed, that in the deſtruction
of them, thoſe menne
which are ſuccoured do alſo laboure,
for that is alſo geuen

them of him that ſaueth them.
Therefore the bleſſed Apoſtle
ſayeth. And not that onely, but
alſo we reioyce in tribulatiōs,
knowing that tribulation worketh
pacience, & pacience bryngeth
profe or tryall, tryall engendreth
hope, and hope is not
made aſhamed:Rom. 5. for the loue of
God is ſhed abrode in our heartes,
by the holy ghoſt whiche is
geuen vnto vs. And the ſame
Apoſtle alſo vnto the Epheſi.
ſayeth.Epheſ. 2. Ye are ſaued by grace
(ſayeth he) through fayth, and
that is not of your ſelues, for it
is the gift of God and commeth
not of woorkes, leaſt any man
ſhould glory or boaſte. For we
are his workemāſhip created in
Chriſt Ieſu vnto good workes,
whiche god hath prepared, that
we ſhould walke in them.
               GOD therfore geueth vnto

them whom he hath choſen
without merites, whereof they
may be garniſhed with merits.
And it is vaynely ſpoken, that
the elect nede not to worke, as
it is alſo, to ſaye that they doe
worke to thintent they may be
elected.
               For the giftes of vertues cannot
bee ydle, for as the veritie
ſaith:Math. 25. to euery mā which hath,
ſhalbe geuen, but to hym that
hath not, ſhall that he hath alreadi
be taken away from him.
               Therefore chaſtitie is not geuen,
to thende we ſhoulde not
fyght agaynſte concupiſcence,
neyther is wiſdome and vnderſtandinge
geuen to any man, to
the entent that hys meditation
ſhould not be in the lawe of the
lorde both day and night. What
doth the gift of loue, if the carefulnes
of beneuolence or well

willing, be not vigilant? what
fruite hath pacience, if ſtrength
of minde haue nothinge to ſuffer?
Or howe ſhall a manne bee
knowen to liue godly in Chriſt,
when he ſuffreth no perſecution?
Or that peace whiche is of
God and with god: Is it wel in
quiet if it agree with ye world?
Or can the loue of god be obteined
without enemitie of the deuill?
The grace of God maketh
no mā at al vnable to be tempted:
Neyther is the battayle of
the Chriſtians fortified on the
right ſyde and on the left with
the helpe of heauenly armour,
to the entent we ſhoulde fyght
with no enemie, whē it is more
laudable and better, to bee able
not to be ouercome in battayl,
then ſluggiſhly not to be able to
be proued or aſſaulted.
               And to bee briefe, and to lette

other things paſſe. I wyl proue
playnly by one teſtimonie, that
the diligence of praier is not reſolued
by the purpoſe of Gods
election. For in the booke of
Thobie, Raphaell the Aungell
ſaith to Thobies ſōne. Remember
the commaundement of thy
father,Tobie. 6. for he tolde thee that
thou oughteſt to take a wyfe of
thy fathers kyndred. And nowe
heare me my brother, paſſe not
vpon the deuill, but deſyre her,
and knowe thou that ſhe ſhalbe
geuē vnto thee euen this ſame
nyght to be thy wife. And whē
thou ſhalt come into the chamber,
take of ye lyuer of the fiſſhe,
and lay it on the coales, and the
ſauour of it wil come forth, and
the deuill ſhall ſmell it and wil
flee away, and neuer will come
nygh her after. And when thou
ſhalt begin to be deſirous of her

company, ariſe both of you firſt
and beſech ye the lord of heauē,
that he wyll graunt you mercy
& health: And be ye not afraide,
for ſhe was appointed vnto the
before the world was made, and
thou ſhalt heale her.
               Therefore though that the
thinge which god hath appointed
can by no meanes but come
to paſſe, yet is the deſyre and diligence
of prayer not taken awaye,
nor the deuotion of free
wyll releaſed through the purpoſe
of election, foraſmuche as
the effect of gods wyl that muſt
be fulfilled, is in ſuch wyſe preordeined,
that by the buſines of
woorkes, by the inſtaunce and
interceſſion of prayers, and by
the exercyſe of vertues, there
myght bee increaſe of merites.
And they that haue done good
woorkes, ſhalbe crowned, not

onely accordyng to the purpoſe
of GOD, but alſo according to
theyr merites & deſertes. For,
for thys cauſe is the foreappointment
of this election hyd
in the vttermoſt and fartheſt ſecrete,
from mans knowledge,
and a manne can pronounce of
none before hys ende that he
ſhal come into the glori of them
which are elected, euen to thintente
that a profitable feare
myght preſerue and kepe perſeueringe
humilitie, and that he
whiche ſtandeth myght take
hede that he fal not.1. Cor. 10. And if peraduenture
a man beyng ouercome
by ſome temptation, doe
fal, let him not be ſwalowed vp
with heauines, neyther let him
diſpayre of hys mercye whiche
raiſeth vp thē that fal, & lifteth
vp thoſe that are downe.Pſal. 144. For as
long as we liue in this body, no

mans amendement ought to be
forſlowed,Note. nor no mans recouering
ought to be diſpaired of.
And therfore let the holi church
pray, & geue thankes for them
that haue beleued, let it deſyre
for them a profitinge perſeueraūce,
& for them which are out
of the faith, let it pray that thei
may beleue: let it not therefore
leaue of frō prayer, becauſe ſhe
is not heard for ſome men, for
God whiche willeth all men to
come to the knowledge of the
trueth, can not withoute all
iuſtice refuſe any man.
