               And alſo perauenture though he durſt & wolde
               He can not wyte where he hyr fynde ſholde
               I ſawe there alſo / and therof had I routhe

                  Me thought this lady ſyghen gan full ſore

                  Thus euer ſlepyng dremyng as I laye
                  within the temple me thought I ſaye
                  Grete prees of folke with murmure wōderfull
                  To croude and ſhoue / the temple was ſoo full

                  And eke I wante connyng to deuyſe

                  Hem to releſe of that they mooſt deſyre
                  That for the prees ſhortly to conclude
                  I went my waye for the multytude
                  Me for to refreſſhe out of the prees aloue
                  And by my ſelfe me thought as I gan goone
                  within the eſtres and gan a whyle tarye
                  I ſawe a man that walked all ſolytarye

                  withoute eſpyeng of ony other wyght
                  And yf I ſhall diſcryue hym aryght
                  If that he had not be in heuynes
                  
                     Me thought he was / to ſpeke of ſemelynes
                  Of ſhap of fourme / and alſo of ſtature
                  The mooſt paſſyng / that euer yet nature
                  Made in her werkes / and lyke to be a man
                  And therwith all as I reherce can
                  Of face and chere the mooſt gracyous
                  To be byloued happy and ewrous
                  But as it ſemed outward by his chere
                  That he complayned for lacke of his deſyre
                  For by hym ſelfe as he walked vp and doun
                  I herde hym make a lamentacyon
                  And ſayd alas / what thyng may this be
                  That now am boūde that whilom was fre
                  And went at large at myn eleccyon
                  Now am I caught vnder ſubieccyon
                  For to become a very homager
                  To god of loue / where or I cam here
                  Felte in myn herte / nought of loues payne
                  But now of new / within her fyry chayne

                  The goodly freſſe in the temple yonder
                  I ſawe right now / that I had wonder

                  The palme is hers / and playnly the victorye
                  If I rebelled honour none ne glorye

                  O god of loue how ſharp is now thyn arowe
                  How mayſt thou now ſoo cruelly & ſoo narowe

                  To gete a pryce but oonly by mekenes
                  For there ne vayleth ſtryue ne ſturdynes
                  Soo maye I ſaye that with a loke am yolde
                  And haue no power to ſtryue though I wolde
                  Thus ſtonde I euer betwix lyf and deth

                  In ſuche a place where I dare not playne
                  Lyke hym that is in torment and in payne

                  And for unknowen tellen how the fyre
                  Of loues bronde is kyndled in my breſte
                  Thus am I murdred and ſlayn atte leſte
                  Soo pryuely within my thought
                  O lady venus whom I haue ſought

                     Sauf by my ſelfe ſoleyn for to morne
                  Hangyng in balance betwixe hope and drede
                  without comforte remedye or rede
                  For hope biddeth purſue and aſſaye
                  And agaynward drede anſwerth naye
                  And now with hope I am ſet a lofte
                  But drede and daunger hard & nothyng ſofte
                  Hath ouerthrowe my truſt and put a doun
                  Now at my large / now fetred in pryſoun
                  Now in torment / now in ſouerayn glorye
                  Now in paradyſe and now in purgatorye
                  As man diſpayred in a double werre
                  Borne vp with hope / & thenne anone daūger
                  Me draweth a backe / and ſayth it ſhall not be
                  For where as I of myne aduerſyte
                  Am bolde ſom whyle mercy to requyre
                  Thenne cometh diſpair & begynneth me to lere
                  A newe leſſon to hope full the contrarye
                  They ben ſoo dyuerſe they wyll doo me varye
                  And thus I ſtande diſmayed in a traunce
                  For whan that hope were lykly me tauannce
                  For drede I tremble & dare one word not ſpeke

                  But in my ſelfe encrece them more and more
                  And to be ſlayn fully me delyte
                  when of my deth ſhe is noo thyng to wyte
                  For but yf ſhe the conſtreynt playnly knowe
                  
                     How ſhold ſhe euer / on my paynes rue
                  Thus oft tyme with hope I am meuyd
                  To tell her all / how I am greuyd
                  And to be hardy on me for to take
                  To axe mercy / but drede doth me thēne awake
                  And thenne wanhope anſweryth me agayn

                  To deye attones vnknowen of ony wyght
                  And therwith all biddeth hope anone ryght
                  Me / to be bolde and praye her of grace
                  And ſyth all vertues be portreyd in her face
                  Hit were not ſyttyng / that pyte were behynde
                  And right anone within my ſelf I fynde
                  A newe plee brought on me with drede
                  That me ſoo maſeth that I ſee noo ſpede
                  By cauſe he ſayd that ſtonyeth all my blood
                  I am ſoo ſymple and ſhe is ſoo good
                  Thus hope and drede in me wyll not ſeace
                  To plete and ſtryue my harmes to encrece
