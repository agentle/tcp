            Dame Chat her deare gossyp this needle had found,
            Yet knew shee no more of this matter (alas)
            Then knoeth Tom our clarke what the Priest saith at masse
            Here of there ensued so fearfull a fraye,
            Mas Doctor was sent for these gossyps to staye,
            Because he was Curate, and estemed full wyse
            Who found that he sought not, by Diccous deuice,
            When all thinges were tombled and cleane out of fassion
            Whether it were by fortune, or some other constellacion
            Sodenlye the neele Hodge found by the prickynge
            And drew it out of his bottocke where he felt it stickynge
            Theyr hartes then at rest with perfect securytie,
            With a pot of good nale they stroake vp theyr plauditie.
