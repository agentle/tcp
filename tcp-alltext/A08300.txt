            TO THE RIGHT Vertuous and godly Lady, the Lady, MARGERY KILLEGREVVE, wife vnto the right Worshipfull, SIR WILLIAM KILLEGREVVE, KNIGHT.
            
            
               IT pleased you (RIGHT worthy LADY) heretofore, to affoord this little Treatise kinde allowance, to enter vnder your Roofe, and to accept it, as a friendlesse Pilgrime, committed to your shelter & protection: and such hath beene the opinion of your selfe, the Patrones, touching the same, that many

others in imitation of your kinde acceptance of it, haue likewise fauourably censured it, and friendly receiued it, not for his sake that sent it, to seeke friends, but for yours, I assure me, that shewed it and me friendship. And now the Booke (simple as it is) being dispersed into the hands of many, with the poore Title of A poore Mansrest, becomes to be more and more richly regarded: And therefore, I could doe no lesse, after this seauenth Impression, but reuiew it, and augment it, and recommed it again vnto your fauourable tuition, nothing doubting, but the longer it passeth abroad in the worlds view, the more it shall increase in your high commendation, that will vouchsafe to countenance so poore a Guest.
            
               Your Ladiships, euer at commandment,
Io. NORDEN.
            
         
         
            
            To all that are in any distresse; rest, and consolation, in Christ IESVS.
            
               
                  I
                Am out of doubt, by mine own experience, that this little Booke, intituled, The poore Mans rest, shall bring no lesse vnto thee, then the title importeth: if thou faithfully vse it, it offereth thee the meane by perseuerance and practice, to attaine vnto the rest of the soule: not as the rich man, vainely promising rest vnto his Soule, through the superfluous fulnes of worldly blessings, & was sent suddenly to hell: but that rest which Christ himselfe promiseth,

               Mat. 11. 29. Where he saith: Take my yoke on you, & learn of me, that I am meek & lowly in heart, & ye shal finde rest for your soules. True rest commeth not by the pleasures of this life, but by the yoke of Christ, namely, by his corrections, which consisteth in troubles, in crosses, in afflictions, in miseries, in want, in hunger, in nakednesse, in imprisonment, in banishment, in things displeasing to flesh & bloud: Why then should we seeme to kicke against Gods louing chastisements and milde corrections, which as an easie yoke he putteth on our necks, & as a light burthen he laieth on our shoulders? He tryeth vs but a little while, & will neuer ouer-charge vs if we seeke rest, and reliefe, and power, and strength to beare it at his hands, &

not at the hands of mortall men: whom yet the Lord in mercy vseth to comfort his afflicted Children. Why then couet we not to bevisited with the rod, rather then to be left to the liberty of this wicked worlds vanities, that are only the baits of confusion? And therefore saith Eliphas, Iob 5. 17. Blessed is the man whom GOD correcteth. Paul, 2 Thes. 1. 5. affirmeth, that it is a token of GODS righteous iudgement, to punish his Children here, that they may be accounted worthy of the Kingdome of God, and that they be not cōdemned with the world: and it is a righteous thing with him, to recompence tribulatiō to them that trouble you, but to you that are troubled, rest; not the outward rest of the body,

while it abideth on the earth, thogh woldly men hold liberty and lust, and health, and honour, & possessions, and authority, and wealth, and wa

               onnesse, and vanity, and fulnesse; yea, and filthines, a sweet and more certayne rest, then the rest & peace of a good conscience, which in all the assaults of sin and Sathan, in all trials, troubles and crosses, in pouerty, sicknesse, taunts and ignominy, and in most bitter misery, if thou canst say truly with Paul, Gal. 6. 14. God forbid, that I should reioice, but in the crosse of our Lord Iesus Christ, wherby the world is crucified vnto me, and I vnto the world: thou shalt haue rest for thy soule. And therefore, what if ye be cast down as into the gulfe of disdaine among men, and seeme out-casts in the

world, & cast-awaies of the world for your troubles & trials sake, and because of the want of the worlds glory? thinke it not strange, nor grudge, hut reioyce; for it ministreth vnto you occasion to flye worldly confidence, & to take hold of the heauenly promises: it worketh discord between you & Belial, and concord betweene you and Christ, raising your thoughts from earth to heaue, because as the body is earthly, & being furnished with the worlds pleasing vanities, is loth to depart and leaue them; so the soule being fettered by naturall & carnall affections, is held also captiue, and cannot lift it selfe vp by the wings of desire of heauenly things, vntill the body be depriued of her delights here; then hath the Soule & inner man scope (sanctified

by the spirit of God) to mount by the wings of Faith vnto her rest namely, to a resolute contentation, to abide the Lords leasure & purpose in all things; yea, when we seeme to be meerly forsaken of the world, we should neither feare nor be faint-hearted, knowing that our Redeemer liueth. But as the Lord of life saith, Seeke yee my face, Psal. 27. 8. Let vs answere with Dauid. Thy face, O Lord, will we seeke. For this is the rest that poore men must seeke; this is the rest that will fill vs better then the Gluttons feast, & is more precious then the health of the body, then the wealth of the world, then the pleasures of the flesh. The gold of al the Indies cannot purchase it, the Kings of the earth (by force) cannot obtaine it, nor the wisest of the

world comprehend it. But thou poore man, who so thou be, in what case soeuer thou art, poore and needy sicke and weake, hated & despised, threatned and abused, apprehended and imprisoned, or in what miserable case else soeuer, euen thou shalt attaine vnto this rest, if thou seeke it instantly, praying faithfully; if thou be patient, and grudge not when thou art visited of the Lord, thou shalt be merry when others mourne, and thou shalt sing when others lament. And therfore learne of Paul in what estate soeuer thou be, to be content. Infinite are the comfor
                  ••
                in the Bible, search and yee shall adde more and more rest vnto your soules. For this little trifle, which I here offer thee, peruse it, and vse it: It may moue thee

to meditate, and procure thee to pray, which preuaileth much if it be feruent. The eyes of the Lord are ouer the Righteous, and his eares are open vnto their cryes. 1 Pet. 3. 12. And therefore cast your care vpon him, for he careth for you, he will not faile you, nor forsake you, that hath conquered, and hath prouided for you a Crowne: therfore fight the good fight, and feare not what man can doe to you.
            
               Yours in Christian good will, Io. NORDEN.
            
         
         
            
            A familiar Admonition to the CHRISTIAN READER, touching the most comfortable exercise of Diuine Prayer.
            
            
               ESAY 55. 6.
               Seeke the Lord while he may be found, call vpon him while he is neere.
            
            
               THere are three things, especially to be considered in the true seeking and calling vpon God: The first is Preparation, before we call vpon God in Prayer. The second is, Attention in Prayer: The third and last is, Thanksgiuing after Prayer.
            
               
               A PREPARATION to PRAYER.
               AS touching the first namely, Preparation, we may obserue & vse a kinde of imitation of men, occasioned to communicate with mortal Princes, who are obserued to preponder with themselues; first, how to shape their behauiour, and externall gesture: Secondly, how to frame their speech to gaine Attention of him to whom they speake: and how to auoide the censure of indiscretion, in the deliuery of what they affirme, or defend. If such curiosity and carefulnesse be necessarily obserued, in our communication with men whose breath is in their nostrils: how much more obseruant and carefull ought we to be, when we addresse our selues to speake vnto the Maiesty of the immortall God? To intrude abruptly into the presence of this great God, and vnaduisedly to speake vnto him, becommeth not a Petitioner, but bewrayeth an vnsanctified

and an vnprepared heart; rather tempting and dishonouring, then glorifying of the name of God. And therefore, before we presume to present our petitions to God, in hope to be heard; we must prepare our selues, not in our outward gesture, onely in eloquence of words, and Pharisaicall outward holines: But in rightly ordering & disposing the affections of the inner man; which, if they be set on carnal, or earthly vanities, if our harts delight in the fruits of the flesh, and the vnprofitable works of darknes: (though our words be neuer so good of themselues) we may feare the reward of Ananias and Saphira his wife, who brought a part of their substance (hypocritically Concealing therest) & laid that part at the Apostles feet. So, if we come vnto God giuing him good words, keeping back our harts, to serue our own carnal and prophane appetites: Shal we thinke that God wil be content with the leaues

of our good words, when we giue the fruits of our hearts to the world? will God take such hypocrites by the hād? we must know, that vnlesse we can truly and vnfainedly cast off our carnall thoughts, corrupt desires, and sinfull affections, it cannot be that God, who loueth holinesse and truth, in the inward affections, can looke vpon vs, as vpon his children, who speake vnto him, as to a father, with counterfeit words, proceeding from vnsanctified hearts. When we come therefore vnto God in prayer, we must depart from all iniquity, knowing that hee heareth not sinners, such as the promises of God cannot win to obedience; nor his threats inforce to forsake their sinnes; who yet will aduenture to rush rashly into the presence of God, in a formall kinde of praying with the lips, without any premeditation, preparation, or reformation of the heart, at all. These offer words for deeds: leaues
                  
for fruits: Wolues for Lambes; and all manner, halt, lame, blinde, and blemished sacrifices, and yet would seeme holy: And so in stead of a blessing, procure a curse vnto themselues for their hypocrisie. We must consider that God is a iealous God, and holdeth none guiltlesse, that taketh his name in vaine as they manifestly doe, that come neere him with their lips, when their hearts are far from him. It is a kinde of spirituall adultery, outwardly to seeme wholy to be Gods, and yet inwardly to be meere worldlings. Before we open our mouthes therefore to God, we must cast out of the Temple of God (which is our heart) all buyers and sellers, as Christ did out of the Temple of Ierusalem: for as long as our hearts doe harbour the desires of worldly profits, and carnall pleasures, aboue the sincere seruice of God, our heart, the Temple of the liuing God, becommeth a den of theeues,

that steales away all our godly affections, to settle them on Belial. Let vs looke vnto the man Christ Iesus crucified, by whose bloud we are redeemed, by whose mediation we are sure to haue our prayers heard of God, and granted; especially, if for our further and more perfect preparation, we can truly obserue the rule of Christ, to forgiue our Enemies, knowing that if we forgiue not our brother that offendeth vs, God wil not forgiuevs, that farre more grieuously offend him. And therefore Christ counselleth vs, that if we bring our sacrifice to the Altar, namely, if we intend to pray; and there remember that a brother hath ought against vs, we ought to leaue our offering before the Altar, that is, forbeare for the time to pray, yet to continue our holy intention to pray; and to goe first, and be reconciled to our brother, & then to come to offer our gift; namely,

our praiers freely vnto God in Christ: for before we be vnburthened of all Rancor, Malice, Enuy, Hatred, and all other prophane desires; it is not onely not auaileable, but lamentable, that so many will (as doe) presume to come before God, with hearts so fearefully fraught with these vnholy affections; and stagger no more to presse into Gods presence, nay, not so much; as some that come vnto God with most prepared, peacefull, and most sanctified consciences. Let such cast out the bondwoman with her sonne
                        •
                     
                   namely; the old man, the works and lusts of the flesh: and giue entertainment vnto the free-woman, and her son, the new man; which, after God is created vnto righteousnes, & true holinesse; And so recommend our prayers vnto God, the obiect of our prayers, in Christ the Mediator of our prayers, by the holy Ghost, the Author of all holy prayers.
            
            
               
               ATTENTION IN PRAYER.
               BEing thus prepared, let vs indeuor to yeelde due and true Attention in our Prayers, that is, to giue heede to what we pray, to whom we pray, for what we pray, and with what zeale we pray: which are the truest tokens, and greatest arguments, that our prayers are liuely, powerfull, effectuall, and of faith; which properties can neuer be in lip-labour: for there cannot be a more apparant discouery of a rancke Hypocrite, then to make outward shewes of Deuotion, with the gesture and lips, and yet the heart to be busied in the cogitation of idle, earthly, and prophane things. And nothing more discouereth an idle heart outwardly, then the wandering of the eye in the time of diuine prayer: for it is probable, and often found by experience, that the eye withdraweth the heart: and if the eye be inconstant, the prayer hath not, nor can haue the due Attention of

the heart: yet it doth not follow, that although the eye be fixed on any certaine obiect, or be shut, that therefore the heart is rightly set on God, for oftentimes the eye followes the heart, the cogitation of the heart making the eye to forget it obiect: as when the heart is wandring in the fields of Corne, viewing the heards of Cattell, and flocks of Sheepe, when it is in the Ware-house, in the Shop, in the Chest, minding bands and payments, ouer-come with pride, plotting reuenge, oppressed with feare, besotted with pleasure, intangled with cares, or otherwise peruerted by any prophane and vngodly cogitations. Prayers made with such an extrauagant heart, be they in words neuer so holy they are imputed vnto vs as sin: for shall we thinke, that God will heare our prayers, to our profit or comfort, when the thoughts of our harts in the meane time dishonor him? Many pray in their owne familiar language, and

yet consider no more what they speake (for want of Attention) then if they spake in an vnknown tongue: & yet such men will hold themselues very deuout, & to haue power in themselues to pray when they list: as if true prayer were of that facility and ease, to vtter, as in an idle tale, and as it seemes by Beggars, that tumble out the Lords Prayer, with one breath at a dore, & yet minde nothing but their Almes. Such men are to be pittied, and to be wished better to aduise themselues, before they attempt this seruice of God most holy; for Prayer is not an easie worke, it is of a deeper straine then a tale, that is but from the tongue to the teeth, from the teeth to the lips, & so into the ayre. True Prayer is cordial, & of that force & efficacy, as it constraineth the heart to sighes, groanes, & teares, with such inward feruency of holy zeale, as tenters the heart with such internall gripes, as may betruly said, the renting of the heart.
                  
And the more we feele our hearts thus inwardly sharply touched: so much the more comfort it yeeldeth to the soule of the faithfull Petitioner, yea such, and so great consolation, as he that feeles it cannot expresse it with his tongue, be he neuer so eloquent; neither can any conceiue or apprehend the sweetnesse of it, that is not exercised and experienced in the same; for nature apprehendeth it not. No man can say that Iesus is Christ, but by the holy Ghost: and none can desire the Spirit of God, but by the Spirit of God, Flesh & bloud cannot as much as desire spirituall things, spiritually; for spirituall things are to be compared with spirituall things, and spirituall gifts are obtained by spirituall meanes: And therefore are words without the Spirit, as naked and bare Incense without fire: but, being inkindled in the heart, and sanctified by the holy Spirit of God, who is promised to

assist our spirits, they are as a liuely and acceptable sacrifice to God, working so powerfully with him, through Christs mediation, as they neuer returne empty of whatsoeuer blessing we desire. Prayer can neuer be effectuall, vnlesse there be some certayne spirituall obiect of the minde, to moue the attention of the heart, which obiect is God: and we must consider, that when we pray vnto him, or yeeld him any other worship, that we are not to conceiue him, in the forme of any earthly or heauenly, bodily or spiritual creature whatsoeuer: for in that manner, not to conceiue him, is a degree of conceiuing him aright, according to Master Perkins. God must be conceiued of vs in our prayers, as subsisting in the whole three persons, the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost. The Vnity in Trinity, & Trinity in Vnity, is to be worshipped, retayning in minde the distinction

and order of all the three persons, without seuering or sundring them: for, as they are conioyned in nature; so are they to be conioyned in worship. And therefore, he that prayeth vnto God the Father, for the forgiuenesse of his sinnes, must aske it of him, for the merits of the Sonne, and by the assurance of the holy Ghost: and he that prayeth for the remission of sinnes to God the Sonne, must pray that he would procure the Father, to grant him pardon, and to assure it by his Spirit. He also that praieth for the same to God the holy Ghost, must pray that he would assure vnto him the remission of his sinnes, from the Father, for, and by the merits of his Sonne. Thus must we apprehend the Trinity in our prayers: so shall we auoide that Idolatrous conceiuing of him, imbraced of some, who cannot pray, vnlesse they haue the figure of a humane Creature, to represent vnto their bodily eyes, the shape of

God the Father, in likenesse of an old Man and a Crucifix figuring Christ, suffring on the Crosse, and the holy Ghost, by a Doue, whose worship cannot be reputed spirituall, but carnall; and their prayers, not heauenly, but prophane. Prayer is a spirituall action, proper onely to the children of God, who are Saints by calling, sanctified in Christ: And they, and none other truly cal vpon the name of the Lord IESVS: prophane persons pray not, though they seeme to pray. But most happy is that man, that commeth vnto God, Father, Sonne, & holy Ghost, truly prepared, and duly attentiue; he may boldly aske, and confidently assure himselfe, to receiue grace for grace, and all blessings spirituall, without limitation, and all benefits corporall needfull. If our prayers be made in vs, by him, who hath promised, and hath power to giue what we aske, shall wee think he will faile to performe? The

                  hope of Hypocrites, indeede, shall perish, & their prayers vanish as the smoke: because they wait vpon lying vanities, and desire carnall pleasures, and worldly profits. But the Lord will surely fulfil the desires of them that feare him, because their prayers t

                  d to the setting forth of Gods gloly, to the good of the Church, to the remission of their owne sinnes, and other mens, to the obtayning of Gods graces, to the increase of the vnderstanding of heauenly things, that they may walke before God, and be vpright, that they may do the works, & bring forth the fruits of the Spirit. These are the prayrs that are the POORE MAMS REST. These are the prayers that wound the Serpent, and that please God bringing peace to the conscience afflicted. But (which is to be lamented) all men are dull by nature: And the very Elect, sometimes weakly disposed to pray. And

therefore is euery godly man to vse all holy meanes, to inkindle their hearts, to the right performance of this heauenly duty: And nothing more preuaileth th
                     •…
                   in, then Meditation: whereunto we are also very vnapt by nature, & know not how, nor vpon what groūd to lay the foundation thereof: yet, if we can truly frame our hearts to a holy Meditation, we shall finde, that it is the very key that openeth our dull hearts, lookt vp vnder griefe, vnder feare, vnder trouble, vnder persecution & misery: and sendeth forth by little & little, the fire of true zeale, which at length becommeth a great flame of preuailing prayers, which thing they easily finde, that are conuersant in this sacred exercise of Meditation and Prayer: who yet, many times finde themselues most dull, & most vnapt to pray, hauing yet an inward desire thereunto which desire they cannot containe: but labouring a while in

silence, speaking inwardly to God in sighes and groanes, at length they speake effectually with their tongues. Seeing therefore, that all men neede motiues to stir them vp to payer: let eueryman addresse himself to the word of God, or peruse some godly worke of religious men. And although vocally he cannot read, by reason of his naturall dulnes; yet, if his heart can be but conuersant, & duly attend the sence, as the eye obserues the letter, his mind by little and little shall mount it selfe from earth to heauen, fixed on the Trinity, whence shall arise such spirituall fruits of faith, & feruency of Spirit, as shall fill the soule with more sweet consolation by inkindled prayer, then the tongue can vtter. And to this end (gentle Reader) according to the small measure of mine vnderstanding, I haue prefixed before euery prayer, a Motiue or Meditation, touching the substance and matter of the Prayer following.
            
            
               
               THANKS-GIVING after PRAYER.
               THe third and last duty in this holy exercise is Thanksgiuing, which cannot but follow sanctified praiers, and that with such ioy in the holy Ghost, as it cannot but breake forth into most vnspeakable inward thankefulnesse to God, who hath been so graciously pleased, not onely to forgiue our sinnes, but to help our infirmities by his holy Spirit, by whom we haue had accesse vnto the Throne of grace, and found such fauour with God in Christ, as we haue obtayned by the holy Ghost, both the will and the power to pray. Also we ought in all things to giue thanks to God, for euery blessing and benefit we receiue at his hands, according to the counsell and precept of the Apostle, who commands vs to giue thanks alwaies for all things vnto God, euen the Father, in the name of our Lord Iesus Christ, Ephes. 5. 20. Thus much touching the admonition.
            
         
      
      
         
            
            A PRIVATE PRAYER for the Morning.
            
               The MOTIVE.
               
                  
                     I Laid me down
                        •
                      and slept, and rose againe, for the Lord sustained me, Psal. 3. 5. This Confession did holy Dauid make (to the glory of God) in the morning, and hath left it to vs, to moue vs likewise to glorifie God, by whom we liue and labor, and by whose loue and prouidence we lay vs downe to rest after our wearinesse, and daily trauell, and doe enioy the comfortable benefit of sweet sleepe, which he hath afforded to refresh all Creatures. And man the most excellent of all other Creatures, receiuing this sweet blessing, and rising from his bed, without thanksgiuing to him that can giue it, or depriue him of it; cannot assure himselfe, whether his sleepe shall turne to his good or

euill: for the greatest good thing that we receiue at the hands of God, turneth to our hurt, if we be vnthankfull. But vnto the godly, to such as feare him, and giue him praise, he turneth euen euill things to good. Therefore as Dauid saith, I will giue thanks vnto the Lord, his praise shall be in my mouth continually, Morning and Night, and at all times, and for all things, Psal 34. 1. Wherby it commeth to passe, that no danger can annoy vs; for why? The Angell of the Lord pitcheth round about vs, to preserue vs sleeping and waking, if we feare him, and call vpon his Name, P

               A Prayer for the Morning, to be said in priuate.
               OH Father full of power, mercy and loue, how dare I looke vp vnto heauen where thou sittest in Maiesty and glory? How can I

thinke or hope to receiue any good thing here in the earth, where thou art in thy power and knowledge? for thou, Lord séest my wayes, and my vanities, and my corruptions and my sinnes: yea, my thoughts, idle and euil, are before thée: yea, my pollutions and imperfections are such and so great, as I am afraid of thy iudgements, if thou shouldest note all that I haue done amisse: yet like a louing Father, thou hast mercifully preserued mée this night, and vouch safed me swéet rest and sléepe, and hast raised me by thy hand, for it is thou onely that preseruest me, and defendest me whether I wake or sléepe, walke or worke, eate or drinke: yea, thou blessest all these things vnto me, or else they would easily destroy mée. For I a weake Creature, am subiect to the infinite dangers that lurke in the pathes of this euil and corrupt life. In the night and darkenesse I sléepe, and haue no watch, and therefore easily may I be ouer-taken with the dangers of the wicked that hate the light, and practise euill in the darke, but that thou the watch-man of Israel, thou sléepest not, but hast a fatherly care, and vigilant eye, and louing regard to thy weakest

ones: when they slumber beset with dangers, thou appointest thine Ange

                  s, and they pitch about them, and they are late. O good Father, I thank thée for thy infinite blessings; beare with my weaknesse, and wash me from my sins, and forgiue mine offences, and direct me in the

                  ight way of obedience, of thankfulnesse, of repentance, and reformation of my life, which is still subiect to vanity, still ready to slide into one sinne or other. I am neuer frée (Oh Father) from temptations, neuer at true peace, but beset with continuall enemies within me; my own corruptions fight against faith and obedience, wresting my will and mine affections, from sincerity to sin, from a desire of good things to euill, from obedience to rebellion, from trust in thée to despaire, or to depend on the vain things of this deceiuing world, which being full of subtil baits, & euery where beset with snares to catch my sou

shrowde me vnder the shadow of thy sauing wings this day, and teach mée truth, giue me knowledge & wisdome, and humblenesse, and obedience, and mortification, and zeale, and faith, and hope, and all graces that may change me from sinne to sanctity, from darkenesse to light, and from coldnesse to a more perfect zeale, to serue thée in all things. Teach me, O Lord, teach mée to execute my vocation truely and perfectly, and giue such issue, and blessed successe to all my endeauours, labours, purposes, and procéedings, as I may discharge my duety in obedience to thy diuine Maiestie, to my brethren in loue and equity, and to my selfe and mine in godly care and true piety. And let thy holy Spirit so guide and gouerne mée this day and for euer, that I may more and more fructifie & increase in all godlinesse, vntil thou shalt cut off this corruptible life: After which (good Father) in the merits of thy Son, let me inhabite, & euermore inherite that heauenly City, new Ierusalem, where thou sittest and raignest one God; with whom shall liue all thine elect, in ioyes vnspeakable for euer.

            A Morning Prayer, where the FAMILY assembles.
            
               O Almighty God, full of loue and pitty, the chiefest comfort that any sinfull soule can haue: when wée miserable sinners here met together, doe consider of thy great mercy and goodnesse, which we haue euer since our births, and before, found, and daily doe finde at the hands of thy diuine Maiesty, together with our great vnthankfulnesse euery way to thée againe for the same, we must néedes confesse, and euen from the bottom of our hearts doe acknowledge, that most vnspeakeable is thy mercy in sparing vs to liue vntill this morning, before which time thou mightest iustly haue consumed vs. But (O deare God) of thy frée mercies, before the foundation of the World was laid, thou hast chosen and elected vs for thy Children; and hast, to our endlesse comfort, certified and made knowne the same vnto our spirits, by thy spirit, by whom, and not of our selues, wee now cry vnto thée

               Abba, father: and for our Redemption, hast sent thine owne Sonne to shed his most precious bloud vpon the Crosse, no other meanes being whereby wée could be saued?
            Thou hast by thy holy Spirit wrought Faith in our hearts, to beléeue by him, and in him to be iustified before thée, and in some measure begunne the death of sinne in vs, and wrought our sanctification; and of thy frée fauour we enioy the benefit of thy Word, the freedome of conscience, great peace and plenty in outward things, with many and infinite other benefits, waking and sléeping, at home and abroad, in our selues and our friends: for all which, instead of thankefulnesse, wee become the more disobedient, not doing that wée ought to doe, but with pleasure and profit, with vanity and selfe-loue wée are carried away, spending our daies in iniquity, carelesnesse, and vnféeling of our sinne, and there is no goodnesse in vs: yet is there mercy with thée. O Lord, and pardon vpon repentance. Wherefore, we here this Morning met together before thy Maiesty, humbly confesse our wants, and most entirely

beséech thée, for Jesus Christs sake to haue mercy vpon vs: Haue mercy vpon vs most mercifull Father, and forgiue vs all that is past: strengthen vs hereafter, that daily both in bodies and soules we may glorifie thée more then we haue done, yéelding thankes for daily benefits, and striuing in holinesse and righteousnes to please thée all the dayes of our life. But because we cannot but offend, and fall diuers wayes, and euery day; good Lord, for thy mercy sake, pierce our hearts with a féeling of the same, and neuer suffer vs to goe on with dull and dead soules, not séeing nor sighing for our offences.
            As a speciall meanes to kéepe vs in obedience before thée (O deare Father) worke in vs a continuall remembrance, and an effectuall consideration that wée shall not alwayes liue here in this wretched world, that doth much please vs now, but that a day wil come when the trumpe shall sound, the Dead shall arise, and all wée shall appeare before the Tribunall seat of Judgement, there to receiue according to our déedes, without respect of Persons: oh, good Lord, giue vs a remembrance,

and a féeling of that vnspeakeable comfort, and eternall waight of glory, which in that day shall be giuen vnto vs, if in this day wée serue and please thée: and contrariwise, euen terrifle our cousciences, and let vs, as it were, see before our faces the dreadfull Judgements, and the fearefull Torments, that both in Body and Soule, they shall be sure to haue for euermore, which in this life doe not serue and please thée; but follow their owne fancies and wicked delights: giue vs an hatred of sinne, and a true loue of righteousnesse: blesse thy Word euermore with fruit vnto our soules, when we heare it: giue vs a desire to heare it often, and to practise it faithfully and obediently, and keepe our hearts euer free from disūmulation and counterfeit holinesse: prepare our hearts diligently to watch for the comming of thy Sonne; make vs ready, fit, and willing to meete him in the clouds, if thou wilt that we liue to his comming, if it please thee in the meane time to call vs, let vs with ioy yeeld our bodies to the earth, and receiue our soules vnto thy selfe, vntill the day when both our bodies and soules shall

be remitted, and bee totally glorified with thee in Heauen. And let this day be a day of our true reformation and repentance, that we becomming new creatures, may serue thee in holinesse all the dayes of our liues, yeelding thee most humble and hearty thankes for thy goodnesse to vs this night: let thy mercifull eye looke vpon vs this day, and so keep vs bodies and soules, that being occupied in our seuerall callings, we may be safe by thee from all our Enemies, and liue to thee in feare, that we may die in thy fauour, and liue hereafter with thee in glory: which grant, and all things in the meane time necessary for soules and bodies, for Christ his sake, in whose name we ask them, saying as he hath taught vs:
            Our Father vvhich art in heauen, hallovved be thy Name. Thy Kingdome come. Thy Will be done in earth as it is in Heauen. Giue vs this day our daily Bread. And forgiue vs our trespasses, as vve forgiue them that trespasse against vs, and lead vs not into temptation, but deliuer vs from euill. For thine is the Kingdome, the povver, and the glory, for euer and euer. Amen.
            
               
Let thy mighty hand and out-stretched arme (O Lord) be still our defence: thy mercy & louing kindnesse in Iesus Christ, our saluation; thy true and holy vvord our instruction; thy grace and holy Spirit our comfort and consolation vnto the end and in the end. Amen.
            
            The Lord blesse vs, and saue vs: and make his face to shine vpon vs, and be mercifull vnto vs: the Lord turne his fauourable countenance tovvards vs this day and euermore.
            Amen.
         
         
            A priuate Prayer for the EVENING.
            
               The Motiue.
               
                  I 
                  Will lay me down
                        •
                     , and also sleepe in peace, for thou, Lord, onely makest me dwellin safety. Psal. 4. 8. Dauid by this declareth his ovvne bodily infirmity, vvherunto all men are likevvise subiect, namely, to such debility, as

without rest and sleepe they cannot long continue; yet this rest (as he acknowledgeth) may be a troublesome rest, vnles God blesse it: for as Dauid did, so all men lye downe and take their rest, but all not in peace; for such as lye downe forgetting God, God leaueth them to themselues, and so their sleepe (in stead of peace) turneth into troublesome dreames, idle & sinfull imaginations, horrible visions, and fearefull fantasies, whereby not onely the body is distempered, but the soule also grieuously vexed. And therefore, though we couch vs on a bed of Downe, with Curtaines of gold, & Couerings of silke, these administer not the peace that Dauid speaketh of, but God is he that giueth it onely. It is not then the sweet sound of Musicke, or the cradle of pleasures, that can giue vs that peaceable sleepe and safe rest that Dauid speaketh of, but Prayer vnto God, in faith and true attonement with him in Christ, thoughts free from sinne, and the conscience cleered, may safely assure a man, that when he lyeth downe, God is with him; and when he riseth vp, God wil not giue him ouer, but be his God, louing and mercifull for euer.
            
            
               
               A Prayer for the Euening.
               MY God and Father, louing and al-sufficient, I yéeld thée praise and thankes for thy mercies, in that thou hast this day past strongly guarded mée with thy hand, louingly refreshed mée with thy fauours, and now safely brought mée to the end of this day, night and darkenesse being at hand, wherein all thy creatures draw to their rest. And I wretched creature, finding mine owne infirmity and imbecillity, run now vnto thy heauenly fauour, who hast made me of that brittle and grosse matter, as cannot continue without rest after labour, without sléepe after waking, and without comfort after sorrow and griefe: I doe therefore beséech thée, as thou art the Fountaine of all rest, and succour, and health, and helpe, so thou wil
                     •
                   consider mée in my weakenesse, and giue mée strength, sée and behold my miseries, and be mercifull vnto me. And sith the time now is come, wherein I couet rest and sléepe, receiue me into thy protection, and yéelde me thy helping

hand, that when this my corrupt lumpe of flesh shall (through the heauinesse and dulnesse of sléepe) be depriued of mouing and sense, and ablenesse to helpe it selfe, I may be kept safe, and securely preserued by thée, for it is thy selfe (Lord) onely that makest mée dwell and abide in safety. Thou art my Watch-man when I slumber: thou art my Defender when I am in danger: thou art my Castle, my Rocke, my Sword, my Buckler and my Refuge: thou art to me and for me all in all: without thée what am I, but a beast that know nothing? but a blocke that féele nothing? but a wretch that can doe nothing rightly? And therefore, deare Father, stretch out thy louing fauour ouer the house wherein I rest: let thy Angels compasse the bed whereon I rest, and thy holy Spirit kéepe my soule and spirit in peace when I rest, that I may rest in peace: that I may rise in peace, and liue in peace: that the troubles of the world dismay me not, that the sleights of sinne deceiue mée not, and that the deuices of the wicked ouertake me not; but as I am weake of my selfe, I may be made strong by

thy strength; as I am poore of my self, I may be made able by thy riches; and as I am ignorant of my selfe, I may be made wise in thée: so shall my lying downe be acceptable, my sléepe comfortable, and my rising vp profitable. In hope of this thy free bountie, louing fauour, and high prouidence, I will lay me downe and take my rest: let it be in peace, and (Lord) let it be vnto me and all thine (when they rest) swéet and comfortable in thée, who makest all thine to rest, and rise vp in safety.
               Amen.

            An Euening Prayer where the Family assembles.
            
               O Most high & mighty God, Father and Protector of all things in heauen & earth, before whom all creatures feare and tremble, were it not in that thou hast commanded vs, neuer durst wée appeare before thée, so corrupt is our nature, and so many are our sinnes. But, good Father, thou

doest bid, and therefore wée obey, thou doest call, and therefore we come, giue vs spirits to pray aright. Wee yéelde thée most humble and hearty thankes, for all the mercies that euer thou hast bestowed vpon vs in body or minde, in our selues or in ours, priuate or common, temporall or eternall. Many and marueilous haue they béene, and still are vpon vs: yea, eueu (good Lord) past finding out. This day what thou hast done for vs, which of vs knoweth, or is able to expresse? Father of heauen, forgiue vs that wée cannot acknowledge them, or praise thée for them as we ought, and quicken vs in this duty more and more. Pardon and forgiue vs whatsoeuer we haue offended thée withall this day, or at any time, either in thought, word, or déede, euen our secret sinnes, such as we haue committed and know not of: remit them vnto vs, for Christs sake: change vs (O Lord) and we shall be changed: create in vs cleane hearts, and renue a right spirit within vs. Breake the strength of sin, that would subdue vs more & more: And (O mercifull Father) so frame these hearts of ours, within vs, that we may more delight

to liue according to thy will, then to enioy all the world, and all the pleasures therein. Lay it often (good Lord) before our eyes, by thy remembring Spirit, that thou hast not breathed the breath of life into vs, that we should liue as we list, but that in holines and righteousnesse, we should walke before thée all our daies. Lay it before vs (O Lord) that the time will come, when the Trumpet shall sound, the dead shal rise, and we, euen we here met together at this time, all and euery one of vs, shal most assuredly stand before thy Judgement-seate with naked hearts, with open and vn
                  •
               olded consciences, there to giue an account how and what we haue done. Then shall all such as haue beléeued in Christ, and truely serued thée in this life, to their endlesse ioy, heare that most comfortable voice of thine: Come ye blessed of my Father, possesse the Kingdome prepared for you. But woe, woe to all carelesse liuers in that day, they shall drinke the wiue of the wrath of God, be tormented in fire and bri
                  •
               stone before the holy Angels, & before the Lambe. They shall haue no rest day nor night, and the smoake of their torment shall

ascend for euermore. Father of heauen, haue mercy vpon vs, knit these hearts of ours fast vnto thée, and now while we haue time, giue vs grace not onely rightly to thinke of these things, but so to walke before thée in this present life, as becommeth thy Saints. O continue thy word of truth amongst vs, euer to our comfort. Let the séede thereof now sowne in our hearts, take such déepe roote, that neither the burning heate of persecntion cause it to wither, nor the thorny cares of this world, riches, or voluptuous liuing choake it, but as séede sowne in good ground, it may bring forth fruit according to thy pleasure. O Father, giue vs grace, that when we heare or 
                  ••
               nde by thy word, any sinne that is in vs, we may striue and study without delay, willingly to reforme it. Kéepe vs, good God, that wée neuer swarue for the feare of man, from our owne true knowledge, becomming seruers of time, and deuiers of thée. Kéepe vs from all hardnesse of heart, contempt of thy word, and from all dissembling of sinceritie. Increase true loue amongst vs more and more. Blesse thy whole Church (O God) with graces

necessary, this parcell of it, our natiue Land and Country: deare Father, blesse it still with continuance of thy truth: Iessen in it daily the number of blinde and ignorant Papists, prophane Atheists, and increase the number of thy true children. Preserue vnto vs long aliue, good Lord, if it please thée, our gracious King and Gouernour: multiply thy Spirit vpon him and all his, that still more and more, he and they may séeke and set forth thy glory in maintaining Christian religion in all purity, suppressing all vice, superstition, and Idolatry, with all seuerity. Giue vnto him an honourable Counsell: giue them graces necessary for such a calling. Blesse all other Nobles, Magistrates, and the whole body of this Realme, with true hearts to thée and to this Countrey. Increase in this our Israel the number of true Watchmen, whose hearts may séeke thée and thy people, and not their owne glory and commodity. Bring to thy fold by them such wandring remnants as are thine, And (O Lord) be gracious to our kindred and friends in the flesh, lighten their hearts with the Sunne of vnderstanding,

that they and wée acknowledgeing one truth, may glorifie thée in the true and constant profession of the same, all the dayes of our life. Comfort (O Christ) thy afflicted members, wheresoeuer, or howsoeuer troubled, and grant vs peace in our dayes, if it be thy pleasure.
            Finally, because the night is now vpon vs, and we ready to take our rest, let the bed (O Lord) strike into our hearts a consideration, that the graue is almost ready for vs. Which of vs can tell whether these eies of ours once closed vp, shall euer open any more againe or no? Lord, therefore receiue vs: into thy hands we all here now commend our selues, bodies & soules, vnto thy holy protection and prouidence: kéepe vs this night and euermore ready for thée when thou shalt call vs. Heare vs, O Lord, O God, and Father mercifull, in these our petitions, for thy Sonne Jesus Christ his sake, our Sauiour: in whose name we altogether begge these mercies, saying as Christ our Sauiour hath taught vs:
            Our Father which art in heauen, hallowed

be thy Name. Thy Kingdome come. Thy Will be done in earth as it is in Heauen Giue vs this day our daily Bread. And forgiue vs our trespasses, as we forgiue them that trespasse against vs, and lead vs not into temptation, but deliuer vs from euill. For thine is the Kingdome, the power, and the glory, for euer and euer. Amen.
            Let thy mighty hand and out-stretched arme (O Lord) be still our defence: thy mercy & louing kindnesse in Iesus Christ, our saluation; thy true and holy word our instruction; thy grace and holy Spirit our comfort and consolation vnto the end and in the end. Amen.
            
            The Lord blesse vs, and saue vs: and make his face to shine vpon vs, and be mercifull vnto vs: the Lord turne his fauourable countenance towards vs this night and euermore.
            Amen.

                  Lord prepare our hearts, open our lips, sanctifie our prayers, and increase our Faith.
               
            
            
               O Most mighty Lord God, and our most mercifull and louing Father in Jesus Christ, we thy poore creatures, and vnworthy children, humbly present our selues in his name before thy glorious maiesty, acknowledging that we be most vnworthy to appeare in thy presence, by reason not onely of our originall, but also of our continuall actuall sinnes, and déepe disobedienee, being originally borne the children of wrath, and the least of our actuall transgressions is sufficient to cast vs into hell and vtter perdition, if thou shouldest deale with vs according to the measure of our

manifold iniquities. We therefore doe humbly beséech thée (O mercifull Father) in the merits of Jesus Christ, fréely to pardon and forgiue our manifold offences, both in that wée haue committed and done those things thou hast forbidden, and left vndone the things thou hast commanded. Lord forgiue vs, and remember our sinnes no more: let them neuer (good and gracious Father) rise vp in Judgement to our condemnation, Giue vs a full assurance of thy mercies, and frée forgiuenesse in Jesus Christ, and let thy holy Spirit from henceforth euermore so sanctifie our hearts, minds, and bodies, that wée neuer hereafter giue consent to the corrupt motions of our fleshly affections, and vnclean desires: and let the liuely light of thy continuall presence so illuminate our dark vnderstandings, that we may still search for thy will in thy word reuealed, and giue vs will and power to practise and performe all godly seruice, duties and obedience to thée: giue vs féeling hearts, that we may finde out our own weakenesse, and confesse vnto thée our infirmities, and that we may boldly in the Name of thy Sonne Christ Jesus

fall downe before thée, calling faithfully and sincerely vpon thy holy name, for pardon for our former euils, & for grace to reforme so the rest of our wicked liues, that thou maist be pleased to accept vs anew into thy fauour and fatherly protection.
            Grant that we may continually féele in our hearts and consciences, more and more the virtue and power of the death & resurrection of our Lord and Sauior Jesus Christ, & that we may continually striue against, and mortifie our grosse sins and foule corruptions, and grow more strong against all euill motions and temptations in thought, word and déede, and be more and more renewed in the spirit of our mind, and féele a continuall increase of ioy and comfort in the reading, hearing and meditating of thy holy and heauenly word, and a feruency of true zeale to séekethy glory, by encreasing more and more in knowledge, and in the hatred of sinne in our selues, & rebuking it in others, especially, in those of whom we haue charge, and in a happy and faithfull going forward in all godly obedience vnto thy will all the dayes of our liues. Direct and strengthen vs, that

we may with all faithfulnesse labour to discharge that duty whereunto wee are bound by our seuerall callings, which in thy prouidence either are already, or shal be allotted vnto vs. Hold vs, we beséech thée, by thy right hand, that we fall not into any danger of body or minde.
            Guide vs by thy holy Spirit in the paths of righteousnesse: set continuall watch before our lips, that wee offend not with our tongues. Keepe our eyes from looking any more vpon, and our hearts from seeking after or consenting vnto vanities: shut vp our eares, that they delight not in hearing the things offensiue to thy sacred Maiesty. Rule & gouerne our hearts, that wée may be alwayes studious of good things, and that wee may be alwayes truely inclined to deale faithfully with all men, and inable vs to performe all duties required at our hand by them, and keepe both our hands and feete, that wee goe not about, or take any thing in hand dishonourable to thee, dangerous to our selues, or hurtfull to any, and that all that wée think, speake or doe, may be to the glory of thy name. Let vs not spend the time, O Lord, of

this our pilgrimage, any more in wantonnesse, idlenesse, or vanity, but in all godly & vertuous exercises, alwaies in simplicity and singlenesse of heart, and in a good conscience, as becommeth thy dearest Children. Blesse, we humbly beséech thée, and prosper all the labors and works of our hands, and blesse all the Creatures which thou hast appointed for our vse, that wée may receiue comfort and reliefe in them, and by them in due season, by thy blessing, and by the daily comfortable vse of them, be the more moued and stirred vp to a thankfull acknowledging thy fatherly goodnesse, in vouchsafing them vnto vs, which without thy blessing, would rather turne to our preiudice then profit, rather to a curse vnto vs, then to our true comfort: therfore good Father, blesse vs to a godly vsing of al thy good creatures, and thy creatures to a comfortable vse for vs.
            And forasmuch, good Father, as our duty in this sacred exercise of prayer, bindeth vs also to intreate thy Maiestie for all our Brethren and Sisters, members of that body, whereof thy Sonne Jesus Christ is the head, frame in vs a true, perfect, and hearty

zeale to pray, and heare vs, also for them: beséeching thée to raise vp the Ministry of thy Gospell in all places of the earth, that by the meanes thereof, such as doe appertaine to thy Kingdome, may be daily called home to thy fold: and that the Kingdome of Satan, Antichrist, Sinne and darkenesse may be weakened, and more and more beaten downe in all the world: hold vp & maintaine the scepter of thy word, where thou hast already planted and aduanced the same, & increase all the meanes by which it may be increased and confirmed, and weaken all the powers that resist or striue against it. Blesse those, O Lord, that endeuor to promote and further it: increase their zeale, wisdome, knowledge and power; him especially, good Father, whom in great mercy towards vs, thou hast made Soueraigne ouer vs, Iames thy seruant, our King, and all his Royall Issue, the Counsellors, Magistrates, Nobility, and the Preachers of thy holy word; all godly and Christian Families, all true Professors of thy Gospell. Beséeching thée to powre on euery of them in their seuerall Callings, such graces, benefits and blessings,

as are most méete for them, wherby they may all shew themselues thy true and faithfull miuisters, in furthering all sincerity in Religion, and all purenesse and godlinesse of life, not onely in themselues, but in others, so farre as appertaineth to their charge, publike or priuate. Beséeching thée also to be mindfull to comfort all our afflicted Brethren and Sisters, howsoeuer, or for whatsoeuer they suffer; especially such as suffer for the testimony of a good conscience. Comfort all them that are pressed downe with the burthen of their sinnes: helpe, relieue, succour and assist all that be in want, in misery and affiction, that flie vnto thée for succour. And as, good Father, we doe thus boldly begge at thy hands these many and seuerall fauours, for our selues and others: so (Lord) accept at our hands our humble thankfulnes which we here yéeld vnto thée, for thy manifold blessings and benefits daily, so louingly and fréely bestowed vpon vs, both inward and outward, spirituall and corporall, in number infinite, for greatnesse vnspeakeable, and for goodnesse farre better then wée could either aske or thinke: beséeching thée

to continue thy gracious fauour towards vs alwayes, and in all things, that we may still giue thée the glory for our continuall safety and reliefe.
            
               In the Morning. Adde this.
               
               ANd finally, we thanke thée, good Father, that thou hast so graciously kept and preserued vs this night past, and hast giuen vnto our bodies rest, and hast brought vs to the beginning of this day in peace, good Father, pardon whatsoeuer corruption hath taken hold of vs this night: pardon our present dulnesse of Spirit, coldnesse of Zeale, weaknesse of Faith, and all whatsoeuer offendeth thée in vs: & blesse the labours of our hands, and our godly endeuours this day, and make vs rather able to be helpfull to others that néede, then to be forced to aske, or to be chargeable to any, by reason of our corporall wants. Grant these things, good Father, and al other graces necessary for vs, and for euery member of thy Church, for Jesus Christ thy Sonnes sake: in whose

name wee further pray, Our Father which art, &c.
               
            
            
               In the Euening, Adde this.
               
               WE thanke thée also, most gracious Father, for that thou hast so mercifully kept and relieued vs this day past: beséeching thée to receiue vs also this night into thy Fatherly protection, and kéep our soules, bodies and goods frée from dangers: let thine Angels encampe about vs, guard vs, and defend vs: giue vnto our bodies that competent rest and sléepe, that may be onely sufficient, and let our thoughts be euer on thée, in loue, feare, and due obedience and reuerence, that wée may be fearefull to commit the least euill, yea, in the darke, which with thée is as the noone day. Watch ouer vs, good Father, that Satan preuaile not against vs: and giue vs grace to be alwayes watchfull for the time, when our Lord and Sauiour Jesus Christ shal make his glorious appearance in the clouds, to finish these dayes of sinne. And at

this time, pardon, O Lord, our weakenes in prayer, our coldnes in zeale, and whatsoeuer doth hinder vs from the true publishing of our own wants and imperfections at full, & thy praise and glory as thou deseruest: increase our Faith, and grant vs, and all thy Children, all other graces necessary for soules and bodies, for Jesus Christs sake: in whose name we further pray, Our Father, &c.

towards thy diuine Maiestie: saue and defend him from the tyranny of forraigne Powrr, and Authoritie, and from all such as professe not inwardly vnfaigned zeale of thy Gospell: giue him godly Counsellors, and such zealous and true hearted Ministers of thy Will, that hee and wée may sincerely serue thée in this life, and in the end for euermore raigne with thée in thy heauenly Kingdome, for Jesus Christ his sake, our onely Aduocate.

            I render vnto thée thanks, O God, that thou hast vouchsafed mée that knowledge, that I may sée and know that I am nothing, and vnable to doe any thing without thée. Thou art the Potter, I the Clay: such as thou pleasest to haue me be, such canst thou form and fashion me: if thou makest me blessed, thou shewest thy mercy and grace; if thou cast me into hell, thou shewest thy iustice, & executest thy iudgement; neither is it my duty to contradict thée, why, or for what reason thou doest it, for thou hast mercy vpon him whom thou louest. These things I consider with my selfe (O Lord) and I feare thy iudgmēts, & depend only on thy mercy.

and saluation relieth wholy on thee, and consisteth in thy hand and power, and thou hast shewed thy selfe a mercifull & long-suffering God to the whole world, & hast testified the same indéede, in that thou wouldest thy onely Sonne Christ Jesus (the innocent) should die for our offences, & should wipe away our sins with his bloud on the Crosse; and since thou hast taught vs in al our perturbations and afflictions to call vpon thée, & craue thy grace and mercy, for that thou wilt giue vs althings, which we shall aske in the name of thy Sonne: I come vnto thée, being drosse and clay, O mercifull and celestial Father, humbly beséeching thée, that thou wilt in thy mercy, make of this vnworthy carkasse of mine, an habitation for thy holy spirit, that though I line in the earth, I may haue my conuersation holy as in the Heauens.

thou hast begun in me; kindle my affections towards thée more and more in liuely obedience, that by thy helpe, and presence of thy grace, I may obtaine euerlasting life, (which thou hast promised vs of thy méere goodnesse) to the end I may praise thée, and giue thée thanks in thy celestiall Kingdome for euer and euer.

            O Gracious Lord God, louing in Jesus Christ, Redéemer of mankinde, who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life, I humbly begge at thy hands, that I may neuer wander nor goe astray from thée, who art the way, neither at any time to distrust thy promises, who art the truth, & performest whatsoeuer thou dost promise: thou art

eternall Life, more to be destred then any thing in heauen or in earth, by thée wée haue learned the true and direct way to eternall saluation, thou diddest instruct and teach vs readily how to beléeue, what to doe, what to hope, and in whom we ought to trust: by thée we haue learned how vnhappy wée were borne through our first Father Adam: by thée we are taught that there is no hope of saluation, except by faith in thée, we take hold of our frée redemption and adoption in Christ.

For in vs was nothing but vtter darknesse, who neither could discerne our calamitie, neither knew from whence to séek the remedy of our misery. Thou didst enter into the World in the shape of a Seruant, and didst take vpon thée our nature, that thy brightnesse might disperse the cloud of our ignorance, that by thy precepts thou mightst directour féet in the way of peace: by the examples

of thy life in thy humility, thou didst limit out a path for vs to immortality, making it easie for vs to tread in by thy heauenly way: so becamest thou vnto vs a way that leadeth to Life, in which, lest we should be wearied, thou hast assured vs by thy promises, that in following thy foot-steps, there is an inheritance of eternity prepared for vs: therefore, whilest we are in this iourney, be thou a staffe to vs, whereby we may be sustained in all our wayes: And by the comfort of thy holy Spirit, repaire our strengths, to the end wée may more willingly come vnto thée: and as thou art made a way vnto vs, seclude all errour, become our

Wherefore I humbly beséech thée, O most mercifull Father, to increase Faith in mee, who am thy vnworthy seruant, lest at any time I wauer in thy Celestiall doctrine: increase obedience in me, lest I swerue from thy

precepts: increase constancy, that walking in thy wayes, I neuer be allured by the inticements of Satan, nor seduced by his terrours, but that I may perseuere in thée who art the true way to life eternall: increase my Faith, that being partaker of thy Promises, I may neuer wa

               O Gracious Lord God, who didst send vpon thy Apostles, and others, thy holy Spirit, filling their hearts with grace and wisedome; I humbly beséech thee, by thy vnspeakable mercy, that thou wilt vouchsafe to fill my soule with thy grace, and water my heart with the vnspeakable swéetnesse of thy Loue, in the loue of Jesus Christ thy most dearely beloued.
            Send down, Lord, thy holy Spirit, to guide me, being ignorant, banish by his light the blacknes of sinne through Christ Jesus, by him refresh my sad and sorrowfull soule: there is neither wisedome nor strength without thée: aide me therefore by that holy Spirit,

and I shall be able to shunne the deceits of Sathan, and to withstand his power.
            Thou art not ignorant, that I can doe nothing of my selfe, extend thy fauourable hand ouer me therefore, and grant that I may forsake and vtterly relinquish my selfe, and flie vnto thée. Mortifie in me whatsoeuer is displeasant vnto thy Maiestie, that in all things thou maiest conforme mée vnto thy will, by thy holy Spirit, that my life may be euer hereafter perfect in thy sight.
            O Lord my God, looke vpon me, thy miserable Creature, whose soule sigheth after thée day and night, when shall I come and appeare before thy presence? when shall I enter into that admirable place of thy Tabernacle, the house of my God? O comfort me with thy presence, that I may taste here in this my mortall pilgrimage, the swéetnesse of thy glory, which shall continue for euer. O my God, I long to be deliuered from all temptations? O eternall fountaine of light, bring me backe againe to that eternall goodnesse, by whom I am created, that I may know thine omnipotencie, euen as I am

knowne of thée, and may so loue thée, as I am loued by thée, that I may sée and inioy thée in the society of all the Elect, who liuest and raignest together with the Father, and the Sonne, a Trinity in Unitie, for euer and euer.

me spirituall rest in the Communion et Saints, that afterward I may kéep the euerlasting Sabbath with thée in the Kingdome of Heauen: behold (O Lord) I knock at the dore of thy mercy, with all my power and strength; beséeching thée to continue vnto me the right vse of all my senses and limmes, and send thy holy Spirit to beare witnesse to my spirit, that I am thy childe, and shall be heire of thy glorious kingdome, through the mirits of Christ Jesus our Lord: for whose sake I humbly pray thee to grant all those things that I haue prayed for, and haue neede of.

now receiued the benefit of the hearing of thy heauenly and holy word, by the mouth of thy Minister, the fruits whereof doetend to the perfection of a godly life, and a godly life is the way to eternall life in Christ our Lord, vouchsafe, O good Father, we humbly beséech thée, to imprint in our hearts the gladsome and most comfortable tidings, which wée haue heard and receiued this day of thée, by the mouth of thy Minister; and grant that in faith vnfained,

            A Prayer for the Sabbath day at night.
            O euerlasting and mercifull God, I giue thée thankes from the bottome of my heart, that of thy mercy thou hast nourished and preserued me by thy diuine power, and gouerned me by thy Word & holy Spirit this day, and all this wéeke, yea, and at all other times of my life protected me by thy power and prouidence: and I most humbly beséech thée for the merits of Christ Jesus, to couer and bury all my misdéedes, which heretofore I haue committed in thought, word and déede against thy diuine Maiestie, in the death of thy Sonne.
            Forgiue (O Lord) the euill that I haue committed; supply the good which I haue omitted, restore what I haue lost, heale my sores, cleanse my filthinesse, lighten my darkenesse, and alter the whole state of my minde, that nothing may be wanting to good purposes in me, nor any thing lurke in mee which may offend thée.
            Water (O Lord) the séede of thy

holy Word, which I haue receiued this day, with the dew of thy grace, that with sound iudgement, and godly deuotion, I may practise such things as are pleasing to thy diuine Maiestie, and that my heart being alwayes obedient to thy Commandements, I may passe my time in peace, through thy protection. O Lord, stretch out thy hand ouer me, and of thy accustomed goodnes defend me this night: Kéepe me from searefull and wicked dreames, vnprofitable cares, idle cogitations, and outward violence. Compasse me about on euery side with thy grace, that when I shall either take care for things of this life, or carefully séeke for those things which appertaine vnto the Kingdome of heauen, I may heare the voyce of thy holy Spirit sounding in my heart from the mouth of the Apostie, The Lord shall relieue thee in all thy necessities, and yeelde thee a Crowne of eternall glory with Christ, his beloued, in the heauens. Grant (O Lord) this, and all other graces méete for me, euen for Jesus Christs sake, my onely Lord and Sauiour.

            A Prayer to be said before a man begins his Labour, or enter into the execution of any profession.
            OMnipotent God, and most mercifull Father, since thou hast commanded, that all humane creatures shall labour, and eate their bread in the sweat of their browes, while they abide in this life, and yet séeing no man can prosper without thy blessing, or receiue any good successe in his affaires, we humbly beséech thée, that thou wouldest blesse our labours in such sort, as therby we may haue iust occasion to confesse thy goodnesse, assistance, and fatherly care, which thou takest of vs.
            Let thy holy Spirit (O Lord) be our guide, to the end we may faithfully exercise the workes of our estate and vocation, without any fraud or deceit: & giue vs grace rather to regard the following of thine ordinance, then to satisfie the appetite of our owne sinfull flesh, which couets to enrich it selfe by any meanes whatsoeuer.
            
               
Neuerthelesse, if it be thy pleasure to blesse and prosper our endeuours, grant vs also chéerefull dispositions, to helpe and relieue such as are in distresse, according to thy talents best owed vpon vs. And let vs kéepe within the bounds of humility, not puffing our selues vp aboue the poore and needy, by that which we enioy by thy bounty and goodnes. But if thy good pleasure be so to deale with vs, as to abase and impouerish vs farre beyond that which our weake nature can beare, yet vouchsafe to enrich vs,. with cleauing faithfully to thy promises, whereby we shall no way fall into distrust, but rather be more certainely assured, that thou wilt neuer forsake vs in the extremity of our wants and calamities; inable vs to performe truely the duties of our callings: giue vs the vse of all our limmes and senses, with an holy endeuour to performe our callings, and patience to attend thy leasure, to replenish vs both with temperall and spirituall comforts, receiuing thereby daily new occasion to giue thée praise and thankes, and to expect all things from thée. Heare vs, O Father of mercy, for thy deare Sonne Christ

Jesus sake, our Lord and Sauiour.

               O My gracious Lord God, I yéeld vnto thée harty thankes, because thou hast preserued me from imminent and infinite dangers, which might otherwise haue happened to oppresse, and vtterly ouerthrowne me, if thou Lord hadst not carefully regarded, and kept me from many inconueniences. Therefore now, O most louing Father, I humbly intreate and beseech thée for Jesus Christs sake, to pardon all the faults wherein I haue offended thée, in the time of my labour or otherwise: correct me not in thine anger, nor punish me in thy heauy displeasure: worke in me so by the power of thy holy Spirit, that hence forth I may walke in greater integrity, and carefully performe those duties which

are required in my vocation and calling, to the end, that though I labour with my body, yet in spirit I may be led by thy spirit, to loue, serue and glorifie thy name in all my doings, words and thoughts.
            Direct and guide me by thy holy Word, in all truth and honest conuersation among men, neuer swaruing from thy commandements, that in the end I may attaine euerlasting life, through Jesus Christ our Lord and onely Sauiour.

               O God Almighty, and al-knowing Father, the fountaine of all comfort

and consolation, I confesse against my selfe, as euermore I haue done, that I haue grieuously offended thée, by my manifold transgressions, and haue thereby drawne downe a most heauy waight of thine importable iudgements vpon me; vnder the burthen whereof I cannot but faint and fall, vnlesse thou set to thy helping hand of mercy in Jesus Christ to support mée: for (good Father) I am weake, and cannot beare thy displeasure; I am ignorant, and know not which way to turne mée, vnlesse thou point out the way vnto me by thy holy Spirit, directing mée within, as thy Word teacheth me without. For it is not euery one that heareth, that vnderstandeth; not euery one that vnderstandeth, that can practise and performe what thou commandest: for who so is not guided by a better line, then that of flesh and bloud, mistaketh the right path, and treadeth the way of vanitie, whose end is death: yet, for the time it is most swéete and pleasing to the outward man, the man vnsanctified and vnregenerate, because hee loueth to be sed with the dainties of this life, as with honor, preferment, riches,

health, friends, and worldly delights, estéeming these the earnest-penny here of Heauen to come, and that wants, and pouerty, and sicknesse, and enemies, and imprisonments, and crosses, are euen here the entrance into Hell it selfe. So foolish are they (O Lord) and ignorant, whom thou guidest not in thy way. And this hath béene my foolishnesse, and my misconceit of the seuerall estates of men in this life, euen vnto this day. But hauing now found by due triall and experience, the foolishnesse of such, as put their delight in these transttory, fickle, and vncertaine vanities, doe disclaime all confidence in them, and doe heartily and most vnfainedly abhorre and detest the deceiuing baits of temporall and carnall delights, and doe wholly betake me vnto the swéet sauing sanctuarie of thy wisedome and prouidence, wherein, howsoeuer the worldly minded doe contrarily iudge, is truest safety, happinesse and securitie: for therein, beare Father, is the true feéling and founded hope of future eternall felicitie: thy wisedome, O Father, is the wisedome of the Spirit, the Spirit the sanctifier of the Soule, the minde

and affections, which being sanctified, begetteth true feare of thée, and that feare is the beginning of that sacred wisedome, which guideth and gouerneth the whole man in the blessed way, the way to life, euen vnto Christ himselfe, who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life.
            O Lord increase our Faith.
         
         
            A Prayer for humiliation and sorrow after sinne committed.
            O Lord my God, and most louing Father in Jesus Christ, I confesse and acknowledge, that mine offences, are increased, and my sinnes are growne vp vnto the heauens, that I am ashamed to lift vp mine eyes to thée, admiring at thy influite mercy, in forbearing to punish me, knowing that I am worthy to be swallowed vp, or swept away with some extraordinary and sudden iudgement. And now (O Lord) especially

hauing so grosely sinned against thée, and done so great euill in thy sight: how haue I (vile wretch that I am) wounded mine owne conscience? how h
                  •
               ue I laid my selfe open to the malice and enuy of the Diuell? what a disgrace and slander haue I brought vpon my Profession? what an offence and scandall haue I giuen vnto others? what a toy will this be to the wicked, that they haue now by mē gotten something to speake euill of? But (aboue al, O Lord) how haue I dishonoured thée, whose fauours haue béene so many, and so innumerable towards me? I know not how to expresse my detestable sinnes, and the hainous and hideous natures of them, when I thinke vpon thy patience, vpon the meanes of grace which thou hast afforded mee: vpon the light of knowledge which thou hast giuen mee, vpon the good motions which thou hast from time to time stirred vp in mee, vpon the profession which I make vpon the sundry vowes and promises of better obedience, with which I haue linked my selfe vnto thy Maiestie, vpon the diuers admonitions (which by thy prouidence I

know) haue béene vsed to mée by thy Seruants, purposely to preuent and stop this euill in mée, mée thinketh I may call it rebellion (which is as the sinne of witchcraft) or presumption in the highest degrée. O Lord, I sée my sinnes, and know them to bée exceeding great: neuerthelesse, I cannot so lament them, so grieue for them, so detest and abhorre them as I should. Striue (O gracious God) strike, I beséech thée, my flinty heart, make it euen to melt within mée, at the sight of mine owne transgression. Settle in it that godly sorrow, which causeth Repentance vnto saluation. Humble my soule vnder thy mighty hand, and suffer me not to fréeze in the dregges of mine owne corruptions: make my head full of water, and mine eyes a fountaine of teares, which may runne downe like a Riuer day and night. O let me take no rest, nor suffer the apple of mine eye to cease: cause me to powre out my heart like water before thy face, that I may, by all meanes, testifie the vnfained griefe of my Soule, that I haue so displeased thée. And grant (O Lord) that I may not sorrow so much because of hell & condemnation, which

J haue made to be due to me, but that my chiefe vexation may be to thinke how I haue abused thy mercy, and requited thy excéeding loue, with so foule a trespesse. Withall (most mercifull God) séeing there is mercy with thée, and that thou desirest not the death of a sinner, but rather that he should turne from his wickednesse, and liue, giue me leaue to become a suter vnto thy grace, not in mine owne name, but in the name of thy dearest Sonne, the onely Mediator & Intercessor of his chosen, I most humbly beséech thée, for his sake, to haue mercy on me, O Lord, one drop of his most precious bloud, shall be a soueraigne Medicine, to cure my running

And (Lord) permit me

not. I humbly pray thee, to thinke it sufficient, that I haue once made some shew of humiliation and sorrow for my fal

So be it.

            A preparation to the Receiuing of the holy Communion of the Body and Bloud of IESVS CHRIST.
            
               ADAM, the first man, was forbidden to eate of one fruit, which was fore-shewed to be mortall, and hee did hasten to eate thereof. Wee, the Children of the second Adam, are commanded to eate of the liuely and sauing fruit, the Body and Bloud of Christ to our saluation; yet, how slacke are we to prepare vs thereunto, and to partake thereof?
            The first step therefore of true preparation thereunto, is to search the Scriptures, who teach the Mysterie of this holy Communion, and the institution of the same, as also the signification of the outward signes, which are Bread and Wine; the things signified, the Body and Bloud of Christ shed for all beleeuers: the end of the receiuing whereof, is to retayne the remembrance of the Death & Passion

of Christ, which he suffered for our sins.
            By the true receiuing of this Sacrament, we are vnited vnto the loue of God, in, and by the death of Christ, the second Adam, being separated from him by the fall of the first. We are made heires by adoption of eternall saluation, in, by, and with Christ, which we lost in, & by Adam.
            
            The true receiuing of this blessed Sacrament, must be in sincerity, with a repentant heart, and faith vnfained.
            And because it is not prouided for sinners (who comming thereunto vnworthily, receiue their owne damnation) wee must, before we repaire thereunto, cleanse our soules from all sinne: which cannot be done without diuing into our own soules, with an impartiall search, to finde out our owne corruption, and truely to repent our sinnes. Therefore, saith the Apostle, Let a man try and examine himselfe, before he presume to come to this holy Table, &c.
            
            It is not fit that wee should come to this holy Banquet abruptly, 
                  •
               s men doe to their ordinary feasts, where they Pharisaically and ceremoniously will wash their hands before they eate; but to this most holy Supper we are not to come without inward washing of the soule from sinne? for if vnwashed hands prophane the meat

for the belly, how much more an vnwasht heart, this sacred Sacrament, the foode of the Soule? Inward examination, impartiall accusation, and an absolute condemnation of our selues for sinne, is the best preparation to this holy Table. For hee that looketh into, and examineth the hidden prophanenesse lurking in the heart, cannot, but (vpon due view of the same) accuse himselfe of deepe disobedience to God, which deserueth death. Finding this, he cannot but iudge himselfe worthy to be reiected from this communion of Saints, and so condemne himselfe that he be not condemned of the Lord: for he that confesseth his sinnes to God, couereth them: and he that coueteth to hide them, increaseth them. Therefore the Apostle willeth all men to trye and examine themselues, which importeth repentance, and so to eate.
            This caueat is no inhibition, but a terrifying of the soule, not to presume to come to this holy Table, without purification and sanctification.
            Herein doth the Lord Iesus discouer his wonderfull loue towards vs, who before hee inuite vs to come to this Table to eate, doth instruct vs how wee should come, and how we should feede. He layes

not this Table to snare vs, as Absalom did Amnon: and yet forewarnes vs, that there is danger in receiuing it, namely, with polluted hands, with hands full of bribery and extortion, to take it with lips defiled with blasphemy, cursing, and lying; to put it into a stomacke gorged with drunkennesse and gluttony, and with a heart making no difference of the Lords body.
            We must therefore lay aside all our old sinnes, and put on the new man, a Righteous, a Holy, and Christian conuersation and disposition. Wee must be holy and heauenly minded towards God, we must be louing to our Neighbours, slow in taking aduantages, or reuenging wrongs, wee must be lowly and little in our owne eyes, meeke and sober in all our actions.
            And because things of so wonderfull value are herein exhibited and offered to the worthy Receiuers, wee must consider who wee are, how wee are cleansed of our spirituall Leprosie, before we presume into the company of the Saints to communicate. Wee must consider well, whether vpon tryall made, as afore is said, wee can assure our selues that we are of the number of those, to whom these holy things doe appertaine For who so is prophane in his person, and an vnsanctified

Creature, let him forbeare to come to this holy Table, and let him first vse the meanes of better assurance: namely, repentance for his sinnes, amendment of his corrupt and sinfull life: let him vse often zealous prayer to God, for remission of his omissions and transgressions: let him craue the assistance of his holy Spirit, to assist him in the beating downe, and mortifying sinne in him, and that his Heart and Conscience may be sanctified. And when he is cleansed, let him shew himselfe to the Priest, his Pastor, and let him take knowledge by his outward Confession, of his inward Contrition, not by particularising of his sinnes, but by manifesting his repentance; and then in all reuerence, let him come to this holy Table, let him eate the Bread, and drinke the Bloud of that Lambe that taketh away his sinnes, and will present him pure vnto the Lord.
            
               The Lords eye is pure, and can abide no wickednesse. The Sacrament is holy; touch it not rashly. If thou haue not on the wedding Garment of sincerity, come not: the Lord will finde thee out, and thrust thee forth of his presence, among the vnbeleeuers, whose portion shall be with the Diuell and his Angels.
            
               
Let vs therefore search and examine our wayes: let vs lift vp our hands with our hearts vnto God in the Heauens, and feede on this holy mysterie, the life of our soules, in remembrance of Christs death, vntill his second comming.
            O Lord increase my Faith.
         
         
            A Prayer to be said at the receiuing of the holy Communion.
            
               OH, most gracious Lord God, mercifull and louing Father in Jesus Christ my Redéemer, in whom thou art also my Father by Adoption, in, and by thy Sonne; my soule, O Lord, which was lost in Adam, bought and redéemed by the Death and Passion of Jesus Christ, doth earnestly long, and entirely desire to be more and more assured, that I am fully and really vnited vnto thée againe in him, and therefore I doe hunger and thirst to partake of those meanes, whereby that sweete and

precious vnion may be confirmed in mée: Increase my knowledge more and more of thy sauing truth, reuealed vnto vs in thy word, and increase my faith to beléeue what thou hast taught for our saluation: let me take perfect and assured hold of my regeneration wrought in me by Baptisme, the seale of thy promise set vpon mée, when I knew not thy Law; wherein as I promised to forsake sinne, and cleaue vnto righteousnesse; so Lord, let the operation of thy holy Spirit then promised, worke in my soule, a true detestation of the workes of darknesse, and loue vnfained to thy celestiall and diuine light. And for that thou in Christ hast left vnto vs a second seale of thy loue, and our adoption, the Sacrament of the body and bloud of that immaculate Lambe, who for a remembrance of his death, & our frée adoption by him, instituted the same at his last supper with his Disciples, and commanded thy Saints dispersed through the world, through all generations, to this day and for euer, to the end of the world, to communicate of this holy Sacrament, in commemoration of that high and most preuailing

sacrifice, the offering of thy Son vpon the Crosse for our redemption and attonement with thée. And therefore, most louing Father, I come in the name of him thy Son, not of my selfe presuming, but in all humblenes, through his merits, vnto this holy Table, to partake with the rest of thy Saints by adoption, here at this time gathered together, of this holy and heauenly banquet; humbly begging at thy hands for his sake, that it may please thée to prepare my heart, which of it selfe is not onely dull, but prophane: teach me, being of my selfe not onely ignorant of this sacred mystery, but too much knowing sinne: Sanctifie me by thy holy Spirit, who of my selfe am not onely corrupt, but wholly prone to euill euermore, & consequently vnworthy to eat at this holy Table, to partake of thy loue so vnspeakable: Oh forgiue me, Father, & in thy Christ here represented vnto vs, ingraft in me a liuely assurance, that my sinnes are done away by his bloud: giue me faith to beléeue in him, who by faith is made ours, and we in him, thine by adoption: elected euen of thy frée mercy, and made heires with Christ Jesus of

eternall glory: whereof this holy mystery is the most assured pledge: Oh make me a worthy partaker of so precious a benefit.
            And for that sinners, Lord, are not admitted to this sacred banquet of sauing foode; where shall I appeare, whose sinnes drew downe from heauen, him, whom thou most dearely louedst, and betraid him to the Crosse: how then shall I presume to appeare in this holy assembly, appointed for thy Saints onely: a Table of sanctitie, whereof none partake, but such as are frée from sinne? Who then (Lord) dare presume to eate of this bread, or to drinke of this Cup? onely those whom thou hast called, who though sinners by nature, yet are they thy children by grace, and so their sinnes are not imputed vnto them, for whom Christ by his death hath satisfied, (apprehended by faith, shewed forth in newnesse of life) and wrought in vs by his righteousnesse, in whose name accept me (good Father,) and let the garment of his innocency couer my sinnes, and so let me come to this holy Table. And as a new man, shaped in holinesse and righteousnesse, let mée

euermore henceforth walk before thée, and more delight in thy Commandements, then in any, or in all worldly things: let me by thy power be powerfull ouer Satan: let his instigations neuer preuaile in me, and let all corrupt affections die in me, and let mee wholly die to sinne, and liue to righteousnesse and true holinesse.
            And for that I liue among men of diuers dispositions, giue me grace to loue all, but to couet to conuerse onely with such as are thine, as néere as I may: to reuenge me of none, but to forgiue all wrongs and iniuries, and so farre to forget them, as I may studie and endeuour to doe good vnto all, especially to such as are of the communion of Saints. And enlighten mine vnderstanding more and more, that I may seé and consider alwayes mine owne weakenesse, wants, and imperfections, that I may so much the more beare, with others, by how much I cannot but confesie, I come farre short of my duty to theé: who so offendeth mee most, I offend thée much more. And therefore, good Father, frame in my heart loue vnfained, true patience, and liuely obedience, Leaue

me not either to the dulnesse, peruersenesse, or pride of mine owne nature, or to mine owne corrupt will, make mée little and lowly in mine owne eyes, and giue me humblenesse of spirit, and indue me with all heauenly vertues, that I may rrsemble my first estate of innocency, and let my present estate of grace come neere to resemble thy dearest children, yea, thy selfe, who as thou forgauest vs in him, that was Lord of all, and for vs became as a seruant, & by his bloud washed away our sins, offering his most innocent body, a sacrifice for our sinnes; whose rent body, and spilt bloud being here represented vnto vs by bread and wine: I doe most humbly pray theé, that wée may be accepted worthy receiuers of his true body and bloud signified thereby; and that we may féele euen instantly, a renewing of our mindes, our hearts to be changed from all corrupt affections, and our soules swallowed vp with the due contemplation of this most sacred mystery, wherein thou giuest vs not onely thy visible creatures of bread and wine, to refresh our weake bodies, but thine owne Sonne, to saue our soules and bodies. Oh, who is worthy

to open the booke of this so high, and so heauenly a mysterie? not the worldly wise, not the great learned, nor the most glorious in the world; onely the poore in spirit, the humble and méeke, such as truely hunger and thirst for their saluation in and by Christ. They onely aske, séeke and knocke, they receiue knowledge and finde mercy: and they are accepted into this heauenly society, seeing yet but in part, knowing yet but in part, féeling yet but in part, receiuing but in part, glorying but in part, & where they yet praise thée but in part. But thou hast promised, that we partaking of thée in this life, after this life we shall fully enioy thée, in, and by Christ in the heauens, to our euerlasting comfort, to our inestimable glory, and endlesse praising thée in him, whom here we sée by the eyes of our soules in faith, on whom we depend in faith, and of whom we here partake in faith; which faith (O Lord) increase more and more for euer in vs all.
            Amen.
         
         
            
            A thankesgiuing after the receiuing of the holy Communion.
            IEsus Christ our true Soueraigne and eternal sacrifice, thou art seated at the right hand of God, vpon the Throne of Maiestie in heauen, hauing the administration of all goodnesse to come, and of the true Tabernacle which is not made by hands.
            Thou entredst once (by thy precious bloud) into the holy places, and hast obtained for vs eternall Redemption, by sacrificing thy selfe vnto thy Father, to cleanse our consciences from al dead workes, to the end we might serue the liuing God.
            We giue thée thankes with all our hearts, because by willing obedience to thy Father, thou didst suffer a most ignominious death on the Crosse, for vs poore, miserable, and wretched sinners, and hast instituted this blessed Sacrament, for an eternall memory of thy faithfulnesse, and fauour, on out behalfe, leauing it like wise as an earnest penny, seale, or testimony, for the remission of our sinnes.
            
               
Thou hast called and brought vs to the Communion of this wonderfull féeding, to the end that wee might refresh our hungry soules, languishing and thirsting after life euerlasting.
            O Lord my God, great is thy loue, thy mercy vnexprsseable, & thy grace vncomprehensible. Thou despisest no persons, comming to this Banquet, except they exclude themselues, or intrude thither vnworthily.
            If any one doe hunger or thirst, here he is fully satisfied: such as are in necessitie, may here finde the riches and treasures of Life: the desolate here méete with comfort: the st
                  •
               ke, here finde physicke, and health for their soules: such as are ouer-laden with their sins, are here disburdoned in their consciences, and they which are assailed by Death, doe here méete with life that cannot be molested. Helpe vs then, O good God, that this blessed Sacrament, which we haue receiued, may auaile vs to our saluation: and that hereafter we may retaine the fulnesse of our hope, without any wauering, because thou art faithfull in all thy promises, and let vs care one for another: giue vs grace to loue all, but

couet onely the societie of such as either may stirrevs vp more and more to godlinesse, or that we may win them to more knowledge of, and obedience to thée, and that wee may in a holy and heauenly vnion often assemble our selues at this holy and sacred banquet, comforting one another in thée, hopefully looking for thy blessed appearance in the clouds for our full and finall redemption.
            Amen.
            Lord increase our faith, and renew a right spirit within vs.
         
         
            
               A Motiue to the Prayer following, against Temptation.
               
               
                  FOrasmuch as no man is free from Temptation, it is a necessary exercise for the Children of God to pray daily to be strengthened against the same, for if the Diuell spared not to tempt Christ, Mat 4. 1. 3. Marke 1. 12. 13. he cannot but tempt vs. And as hee began with Christ, knowing him to haue long fasted, and

deemed him so desirous to eate, as hee would haue done any thing to haue had bread, as Esau longed for his brothers pottage. And as hee himselfe in the beginning fell by ambition and vainglory, he thought it had beene the humour of Christ likewise to de
                     •…
                  e terrene glory: according therefore to these two occasions he tempted Christ to accept of both, or either of them. But hee had no aduantage against Christ, but fifteth and findeth man of another inclination, wholy and altogether corrupt, and so prone naturally to sinne, as there resteth in all men some peculiar humour, and a kinde of priuate and commanding sinne, which so farre commonly ouer-ruleth the affections, as whensoeuer it offereth it selfe, it easily draweth consent euen of the whole man, as Nabals couerousnes, whom the rich doe imitate, who although they might be free from all other sinnes (as they cannot be) it were sufficient to condemne them: some are wholly ouercome, and make drunkennesse their whole delight, some bribery and extorsion, some whoredome, some wantonnesse. And these and such like sins, are, as it were, the Bailiffes and Stewards of the houses of mens hearts, which who so embraceth, and

holdeth them so deare, as he will not endeauour to be freed of them, is not the childe of God. And therefore this prayer following may be vsed of all men to that end, although hee would be ashamed to confesse it before men. God already knowing it, his confession to him shall more and more make a way for repentance, and obtaine strength to resist the Diuell in his temptation, who obseruing our inclinations, bendeth his temptations accordingly: and hauing wonne but the outerward of our hearts at the first, a bare consent, he then will visite oftner, vntill he haue made custome so strong, as it becommeth an habite, or as it were another nature: So that a man may as well endure the plucking out of his eyes, as the shaking off of that accustomed sinne. And therefore it behooueth all men to be watchfull against Satan, and to resist him by prayer.
            
            
               
               A Prayer against Temptations, especially fit for a man that findeth in himselfe a continuall strong inclination to any particular sinne.
               O Gracious God, and most louing Father, who in the beginning didst create man to thine owne image and likenesse, in all sinceritie, and didst place him (in the holy estate of his innocency) in the swéet garden of all heauenly and earthly delights, and in thy superabundant mercies didst ordaine all thy creatures in Heauen and Earth to doe him seruice: O what was man, that thou hadst such respect vnto him? And yet how suddenly (Lord God) did hée fall from that estate of originall grace? how grossely did hée disobey, and rebell against thy will reuealed vnto him? By whose fall all corruption entred, where before was nothing but sanctity: by whose corruption the earth became corrupt, and all things in the earth began to disobey him for whom they were created, as he disobeyed thée by

whom he was created. And by his transgression, all that haue procéeded of him by a lineall originall pollution; haue all defiled their wayes, and all men by nature are likewise so farre tainted with that first offence, as infinite offences are bred in euery man by that offence: as I, for my part (good Father, against whom that first sinne was done) do acknowledge, that I féele the force of that originall corruption, working so strongly in me, that I cannot but accuse my selfe to be the most vile, and vnworthiest of all Adams issue: for I cannot otherwise iudge of my selfe, when I looke into, and sée, and consider what I am, and how I am inclined to sinne. I cannot but confesse, what I cannot hide from thée, who séest the most secret and most couered thought of the heart, much more then the déedes of darkenesse, which I commit, to whose all-séeing eyes the darkenesse and light are all one, and therefore findest out all my sins, whether they be in thought, intent, or action. And although euery sinne bringeth death, yet there is a promise vpon repentance, that they shall be forgiuen. But (Lord) among many sinnes, remaining

in mée, thou séest one principall, and as it were, a raigning & commanding sinne in me, whereunto I am drawne by the continuall violence of that neuer-ceasing aduersarie Satan, who worketh my more corruption, and by my corruptions polluteth mine affections, and mine affections bréede so strong an inclination to that odious sinne, that I am weake to performe what thou commandest, and strong to effect what thou forbiddest. Therefore (good Father) kill all, and especially this sinne, that hangeth so fast on mee, that it raigne no longer in mée: for I féele it an heauy and loathsome burden vnto my soule, which I cannot shake off, as of mine owne power, but by the speciall working and strength of thy holy Spirit, who worketh true repentance. O worke true repentance in me, and make sinne more and more loathsome vnto mee: for thou séest (Lord) that I commit all sinne, as it were against my wil. Giue me therefore power to bridle all my corrupt affections; the consideration whereof grieueth me, and a heape of feare possesseth my soule, despaire presenting it selfe before me, which would vtterly deuoure

all hope of reconciliation with thée, did not thy word and promise firmly assure me, not onely of frée pardon for all that is past, but of power also to withstand Satans future assaults, in the bloud and merits of Christ Jesus thy Son my Sauiour; yet not without my true and serious repentance, which also is thy gift. O worke in me true repentance, giue me grace to withstand all temptations. And although I shall neuer so mortifie my corruptions, but some dregs will remaine, and breake forth, yet kill the strength of this & all other sinnes in me, that I may be able truely to assure my conscience, that what I would doe, that I doe not; & what I would not, that I doe: that thy frée fauour and loue in Jesus Christ, working in me, for me, & by me, faith, obedience, and a renued heart, may worke and preuaile in mee, to the withstanding of the tempter and his temptations: suppresse my corruptions, and their fruits, and make mée to become more & more holy, by the imputed holinesse which in thy sonne, by promise, is mine: to whom with thee and the holy Ghost be ascribed all honour and praise for euer.
               Amen.
               
                  
Lord increase my Faith, and giue mee true repentance for my sinnes, and power euermore to resist them.
            
         
         
            A Prayer for a prosperous Iourney.
            
               O Lord, in whose hands all things, and all men are, the Guide and Protector of all that beléeue and come vnto thée, I come (Lord) vnto thy diuine Maiesty, begging at thy hands pardon for my sins, which I doe confesse to be very great, & worthily may pull downe a great and weighty burden of thy Judgements vpon mée, and nothing can truely prosper with mée, vntill I be reconciled vnto thee in Christ, in whom thou art so well pleased, as who so in him commeth vnto thée, neuer departeth emptie of some blessing or other: and therefore I now, good Father, vnder thy fauour, by thy permission and fatherly furtherance, intending to take my iourney, doe beséech thée, to pardon my sinnes: and grant that before I betake mee to my trauell, I may séele in my conscience a

liuely assurance that thou hast forgiuen mee, and that I am reconciled vnto thee, and at peace with thée, that so I may be assured, that as thine holy Angell went with the seruant of Abraham, and prospered his iourney; as an Hast of Angels were present with Elisha, to defend him from the King of Aram, and as thine Angels comforted and conducted Iacob in his iourney: so thou wilt send thine Angels with me, that they may take charge of mée, conduct mée, guide mée, and prosperously spéede my iourney, and giue good successe vnto the occasion of my trauels: for I doe confesse and acknowledge, that it is not in the wisedome, the art, power, 
                  •
               r prouidence of man, either to preuent the dangers, which in diuers manners doe lye hid and concealed from the wisest, till they fall; neither to performe his iourney, or to accomplish the occasion of the same prosperously: and therefore, vnlesse thou maist be pleased to assist me with thy grace, to support mee with thy hand, to defend me in thy mercy, to blesse mee in thy loue, and in thy prouidence to comfort mée: I cannot but confesse, that my iourney cannot be prosperous, my selfe

in body or soule safe, nor the businesse where about I goe, come to good effect. 
                  •
               ith therefore, good Father, thou hast made vnto all men that come vnto thée, an assured promise, that thou wilt neuer faile, nor forsake them, but wilt command thine Angels to take charge of them, that nothing shall hurt them; and that thou wilt be with them in the way they ride or 
                  •
               o, in the house wherin they rest, or refresh them; and wilt enable them to performe that which they intend, better then they haue either skill or ablenesse: blesse me, I beséech thée, with such wisedome, will, power, and discretion, as I may so performe my iourney, and the occasion thereof, as may be to the discharge of my dutie to thée in true obedience, to man in a good conscience, and to my selfe in a due regard of the reliefe of mée, and such as thou hast giuen mée: and withall, most gracious Father, sith that thou hast ordained thy Creatures to serue to my vse in this my iourney, blesse them (I beséech thée) with strength and power to performe the seruice for me, which the necessitie of my iourney requireth, that my iourney being ended, and my busines duly

effected, I may returne the praise and glory to thy most holy name in Christ: to whom with thée and the holy Ghost be ascribed all honour, power, glory, and dominion for euer more.
            Amen.
            Lord increase my Faith, and prosper my Iourney.
         
         
            A Motiue to the Prayer folowing, against Enemies.
            
               IT is the nature of carnall men to hate their Enemies, and seeke all meanes possible to be reuenged of them: wherein they offend the Maiestie of God, and make him their enemy: for he hath said, Vengeance is mine, Rom. 12. 19. And therefore we must take heede, wee take not the office of God vpon vs, in taking reuenge of our Enemies, either by our owne sword, or by any sinister meanes, but to appeale vnto the Christian Magistrate, who beareth the Sword to right the wrongs done vnto his children. Wee must leaue the reuenge to whom it belongeth, and seeke to be, and

to continue at peace with God, without which no Creature can be at true peace with vs. And being reconciled to him in Christ, we shall not need to feare our enemies, for he will make our Enemies to feare vs, as he made Esau to feare Iacob, Genes 35. 5. 6. If we walke in his commandements, and obserue his Lawes, among many other blessings, We shall chase our Enemies, & they shall fall before vs, Leuit. 26. 7. 8. Deut. 11. 23. 25. & 28. 1. 7. And hee will deliuer our Enemies into our hands, if it be expedient, or our cause being heard before the Magistrate, hee will giue censure with vs, and make vs to reioyce ouer them, that would triumph ouer vs. And therefore in these crosses of Enemies, we must flye vnto God by prayer, as Dauid in many of his Psalmes sheweth himselfe to haue done, and especially in the 35. Psalm. If therefore thy cause be iust, and thou be vniustly pursued, feare not, for God will not faile thee, nor forsake thee.
         
         
            
            A Prayer against the power and practices of Enemies, who slander and pursue a man, either without a cause, or in a matter which he cannot reconcile.
            
            INcline thine eare, Lord, vnto my prayer, and harken mercifully vnto my complaints, for thou séest how man intendeth mischiefe against mée; many lay snares for mée to catch me, that they may take mée, and so deuoure mée, but thou art my trust, I will not feare what man can doe vnto mée: yet, good Father, iudge and reuenge my cause, let them not triumph ouer me that hate me without a cause: say I, without a cause? yea, Lord, without cause cōmitted against them, vnlesse thou calling to minde my sins committed against thée, doest stirre them vp to be instruments of thy wrath against me: So am I indéede in excusable, for I doe confesse, that I haue transgressed thy Lawes, I haue done euil in thy 
                  •
               ight, but to these men, Lord what haue I done? my conscience is cleare of all desire to offend them: and

therefore, Lord, let their malice come to an end, if not, Lord, giue me Faith in thée, and patience to indure them for thée, whom indeede I haue offended. They trauell in mischiefe, thou art mercifull; they conceiue wickednesse, and bring forth lyes, but thou art righteous, the God of truth: my defence is in thée, and therefore, though they digge pits for mee, they shall fall in themselues, and be taken in the same, that they themselues haue laid. Their mischiefe shall returne vpon their owne head, and their cruelties vpon their owne pates, although in their pride and malice they boast themselues, as if they had already destroyed me. Up, Lord, therefore, and defend mee, let them not preuaile against mee, rather let them relent or perish. They thinke in their hearts, as it séemeth by their insolence, they shall neuer be remooued, and thou séest it; thou beholdest their wrong done vnto thée: take my cause therefore into thine owne hand, for thou iudgest right, and helpest such as suffer violence. Oh, breake the arme of the wicked and malicious, who bend, their bow, and make ready their arrowes vpon the string,

that they may secretly shoote at them which are vpright in heart: they shoote out their sharpe and malicious accusations, bitter words and slenders against mée: yet, Lord, of thy mercy it is, that though they hit mee, yet they wound mée not deadly, their hatred and malice tendeth but to the hurt of my body, not being able to touch my soule: and therefore if they should preuaile, their conquest were small, but my ransome is their owne ruine: curbe them, good Father, and bridle their wicked deuices: set mée at liberty, whom these wicked men would hold for euer snared. I rest vpon thy prouidence to be defended: I séeke not reuenge against them, vengeance is thine, thou wilt reward: but were I inclinable to reuenge, they are more mighty then I, more carnally politicke then I, more befriended of the world then I, and yet as Elisha said vnto his Seruant, there are more with mée then with them: for thou pitchest an Hoast of Angels about such as are thine. Therefore, I will neuer feare what these men can doe vnto mee, either by fraud or force, openly or secretly: for thou who iudgest rightly, wilt

turne all their malicious deuices to worke for my good, and their owne confusion, as thou didst end the malice of hatefull Haman, against harmelesse Mordecai. Wherein thy prouidence brought it to passe, that he was snared that laid the grin, and fell into the pit he made for another. Therefore, good Father, I will rest me vpon thy prouidence, and relye vpon thy mercies in Christ, in whom all things shal worke together for my good, as did the selling of Ioseph by his Brethren, his Mistresses false accusation, & his wrongfull imprisonment, all which together wrought to his high aduancement. Euen so, Lord, let all things worke to my conformation, and consolation in Christ: heare mée, oh, heare me, lest they reioyce ouer me, for when my féet slip, they reioyce and extoll themselues against me.
            O Lord increase my Faith, and weaken mine Enemies.
         
         
            
            A Prayer of the Flocke, for their diligent, painfull and faithfull Pastor.
            O Most bountifull and great God, how gracious hast thou béen vnto vs, in lending vs a good and godly Past or according to thine owne heart, who is able and willing to instruct vs with knowledge and vnderstanding, and to deliuer vnto vs faithfully thy holy Word, one, who is sufficient to resolue vs in our doubts, and to comfort vs in our calamities, to recall our wandrings, to instruct our ignorances, and to goe before vs, as a guide, in the way that leadeth to saluation: O Lord, thou hast not so dealt with all people, neither is there any desert at all in vs, for which thou shouldest bestow on vs such a fauour. If thou hadst still left vs in our naturall darknesse, and hadst suffered vs to be perpetually plunged into that region of the shadow of death, in which we sate of our selues, it had béene but iustice in thée euen vtterly to haue forsaken 
                  •
               s. O Lord, make vs thankfull,

and quicken vs vp, that we may euen fill our mouthes with the praises of thy name, who hast caused the light of thy Gospell thus to shine amongst vs, to our excéeding great comfort. O make vs carefull and diligent to walk while we haue light, that wée may be the children of light, and to beware how we receiue thy word in vaine, or neglect so great saluation: let vs euer remember, that to whom much is giuen, of them there will be much required, and that our sinnes will be the greater, and our iudgement the more heauy, if we make not right vse of this thy mercy. And concerning the Watch-man, whom thou hast appointed ouer our soules, wée beséech thée to inlarge his heart, to increase his gifts, and to replenish him yet with a fuller measure of thy Graces. Giue him (O Lord) the true zeale and spirit of Paul, that he may with all boldnesse of spéech giue vnto vs thy Gospell, and publish euen the secrets thereof, for the edifying and comfort of our soules. Make him powerfull in the holy Scriptures, like Apolloes, that by the power thereof hée may both conuict our consciences, and stoppe the mouthes of all

gaine-sayers. Powre into him thy holy Spirit, the word of wisedome and knowledge, that he may rightly iudge of our estates, and vnderstand what things are most expedient and necessary for vs, and so may speake to our consciences, finding vs out in our speciall sinnes, and directing vs in those holy courses, from which wée haue chiefely strayed. Let his words pricke our hearts forward, that wée may not be hardened through the deceitfulnesse of sinne. Make him firme and constant in the best courses, that he may not be as a Réede shaken with the winde, but as a sure foundation, that by his perseuerance in good workes, our hearts may be the better established. And wée beséech thée (O Christ) who commandest the Starres, and holdest them in thy right hand, to defend him from vnreasonable and euill men, and from the wrongs and iniuries of the wicked enemies of thy truth: for doubtlesse, men of corrupt mindes will resist the Truth with all their power. Therefore (good Lord) blesse his labour, to the calling and conuerting of those, which are elected vnto saluation.
            
               
Make our hearts flexible to yéelde true obedience to thy Word deliuered from his mouth, that wée may receiue it, not as the word of a man, but (as it is indéede) thy Word, and make it also effectuall in vs, that wée may not onely be professors and hearers of thy holy will, but also practisers and continuall performers of the same. And teach vs to reuerence him, wée beséech thée, and to loue him for his profession and workes sake, not sparing our goods to relieue him, knowing it is a small thing for him to 
                  •
               eape our earthly things, who soweth amongst vs spiritual food for our soules. In all our Supplications make vs mindefull of him without ceasing, that his studies may be directed, his endeauours guided, and his labours in thy worke blessed, to the glory of thy holy name, and the saluation both of him, and of vs which heare him: All which we humbly and earnestly begge at thy fatherly hands, for thy deare Sonnes sake, who hath ordained Pastors and Teachers for the gathering together of his Saints, and who is the supreme and soueraigne Bishop of all our soules: to whom be all praise, honour

and glory, now and for euermore.
            Amen.
            O Lord increase our Faith.
         
         
            A Prayer for the true obseruation of the Commandements of the Lord.
            O Omnipotent, and euerlasting God, maker of heauen and earth, who hast frō the very beginning promised to be our Lord and our God, our fortresse, our buckler and defence, our castle & refuge, who hast brought vs with a mighty and strong hand, with an out-stretched arme, out of the land wherein we were strangers, and liued in bondage (vnder the yoake and tyranny of Antichrist and Satan) into the land that floweth with milke and hony, and of true Religion, wherewith thou feédest the Soules of the faithfull ones, to their vnspeakeable comfort, grant that as through thy mercy and loue, thou vouchsafest to

bring vs into this world, and to frame vs to thine owne image and likenesse, so wée may account thée as our onely God, worshipping none other besides thée, making our selues none image of any likenesse, either of things aboue, or things beneath, nor to séeke helpe at the hands of any, as a God, beside thée, who as by thy mighty power, thou broughtest the children of Israel out of Egypt, by the hands of Moses and Aaron, where they were in bondage, and were continually oppressed with sundry kinds of vexations, both of body and minde, so thou hast vouchsafed to bring vs and deliuer vs from a greater bondage and slauery, euenfrom the power of Sathan, vnder whose tyranny wée rested, and now escaped not by any other pollicie, strength, or power, but by the bloud-shedding of thine only Sonne, Jesus Christ, who tooke vpon him the death of the Crosse for our sakes, to bring vs from darkenesse, wherein we walked according to the wil of the flesh, vnto the true knowledge of thée againe, and to redéeme vs out of the bondage of sin, into the land of righteousnes; from blind ignorance to the bright shining day-starre of thy

heauenly will, who art not onely a most louing and most gentle Father, but also a most sharpe punisher and reuenger, who art not onely desirous that we should come vnto thée, but art also most iealous ouer vs, lest wée should séeke or follow any other gods besides thée: yea, in all our afflictions and troubles thou wilt that wée séeke onely thée; and being relieued, to attribute the onely meane thereof vnto thy selfe, whereby thou hast promised to be mercifull vnto thousands that 
                  •
               oue thée, feare thée, séeke thée, and truely take hold of thée, as their onely God: and againe, threatnest vengeance on the third and fourth generation of them that hate thee, and follow strange gods, neglecting thy Commandements: O God, vouchsafe that wée neuer put our féete towards any strange gods, appeare their helpe neuer so likely and plentifull, but that it may both now and euer continue in our harts to confesse both in word & conuersation, that there is none other God besides thée, who art a most gracious and louing Father. Haue mercy vpon vs, O Lord, haue mercy vpon vs, and so vouchsafe to direct vs in all our doings,

cogitations and words, as we may alwayes, and in all things, fulfill thy will, without taking thy most holy and most glorious Name in vaine, by blasphemous spéeches, dishonouring the same: kéepe vs, most louing Father, not onely from the most detestable sinne of periurie, whereby thy holy Name is often defaced, and as it were, trodden vnder-foote, as in making it the author of abhominable falshoods and lyes; but from all friuolous and vaine eathes, which to the great griefe of thy Children, and dishonour of thy Name, are most vncomely in the mouthes of such; as vnreuerently and rashly vse it euen in common spéeches, without any vrgent cause, whereby they fall into the most hainous sinne of taking thy most glorious Name in vaine: O Lord forgiue vs, and grant that we may vse such a reuerent manner, and godly order in triall of matters in controuersie, as we may be alwayes true hallowers, and not abusers of thy Name therein. And forasmuch as thou within sixe dayes didst finish all things in the beginning, and in the seuenth day didst rest from the same labour, commanding vs to obserue

the sanctification of the same for euer, and to rest from all labours, trauels, and wordly businesses, and not onely our selues, but our Seruants, Oxen, Asses, and such like: Grant that we may not onely lay a side all worldly cares and businesses on the Sabbath day, but may in all things sanctifie and kéepe it holy with godly exercises, diuine prayers, and heauenly meditations, with diligent regard to the auoyding of all pastimes, foolish and vncomely exercises, and vnlawfull practices, whereby oftentimes the affection being mooued to impatience, powreth forth choler, to the dishonouring of thée. Let our conuersation be altogether modest, mortifying our owne desires, wholly applying our selues, not onely on the Sabbath day, but all the wéeke; yea, all our whole life, to the seruice of thée, to the honouring and glorifying of thy Name, to the benefit of our soules, profit of our neighbours, and due reuerence to our Parents, whom thou hast commanded vs to honor, loue: and obey, as the instruments of our beginning, thou being the workman. Grant, Lord, that wee truely and vnfainedly reuerence

them, as thou willest we should, that we may long continue vpon the earth, not in the number of carelesse and disobedient children, in whom resteth no thankfulnesse for so great benefits had and receiued at the hand of their parents, from whom thou hast said, thou wilt with-hold thy blessings, and altogether depriue them of their libertie of liuing. But grant that we may so order our selues by thy grace, both to them and other our Superiours, that wee may receiue at thy hands, many good gifts and length of dayes here, according to thy promise in Christ.
            Let it likewise please thee (O Lord) to continue thy blessings in and vpon vs, that it may goe well with vs all the dayes of our liues: take from vs (Lord) all destres of reuenge, all rancour, hatred, and malice, lest the Diuell (who rea
                  •
               ily stands to pricke vs forward to a desperate minde) procure vs to slay the innocent. Wée beséech thée (good Lord) let not at any time such euill imaginations enter into our hearts, lest wée (giuing our selues thereunto) loose the reynes of our naturall disposition, which is 
                  〈◊〉

               ing thereof pluckt out by vertue of thy holy Spirit, it prouoke vs to waite opportunity to wreake our malice with violence vpon such as by small occasions haue offended vs, yea, and by little and little breake out into that height of hatred, as to prouoke vs to séeke the meanes to destroy the innocent.
            O Lord forbid it, and kéepe vs from the most pernitious sinne of adultery, which being so odious in thy sight, as thou causedst to fall in one day for the same twenty and thrée thousand, but indue vs with thine holy Spirit, that we may kéepe our bodies cleane and vndefiled members of thée, endued with perfect sanctity, may abandon all occasions that may procure vs to offend thée, retaining a godly behauiour, which thou dearely louest, and expelling euill concupiscence which thou deadly hatest.
            O mercifull God, vouchsafe to kéepe vs from taking any thing by indirect meanes from any man, whom wee ought to loue as our selues; the desire whereof (good Lord) procéedeth

often by scarcitie and want, by pouerty and néede, which indéede thou art able and willing to relieue without any such vnlawfull meanes. And therfore I beséech thée to grant vs a sufficient and necessary portion, or else constancy and vnfained hope in thee, to be relieued in thy good time, and vtterly to detest the horrible sinne of stealing, for thou hast promised, neither to faile vs, nor forsake vs, cal

               ing faithfully vpon thée in time of our necessity. And as we ought to beware of taking any thing of others by steaith, so likewise vouchsafe when any occasion serueth, to grant vs héedfull mindes to depose and testifie that which is truth, according to our knowledge, without any respect, either of greatnesse, friendship, or fauour of the one, or the e
                  •
               uy, malice, or pouerty of the other. And grant that wée raise no false accusation or slander vpon any man, but that wée may kéepe our mouthes from speakeing any thing hurtfull vnto others, but to shew our selues helpefull both in word and déede to all: and like good men, muse and meditate afore-hand, what we ought to speake, not letting the bridle of our lips loose,

to babble out that which first commeth into our mindes, and that we may content ourselues with our estates, whatsoeuer thou sendest, without an vngodly desire of any thing that belongeth vnto our Neighbours. And grant vs by thine especiall grace, euermore to obserue, and faithfully to fulfill all thy most godly Commandements, in the name, & for the sake of Jesus Christ: in whose Name: as well for grace to kéepe thy Lawes, as also for all necessaries for body and soule, I heartily beséech thée, in that forme of prayer which hée hath set downe vnto vs in these words:
            Our Father which art in heauen, hallowed be thy Name. Thy Kingdome come. Thy will be done in earth as it is in Heauen. Giue vs this day our daily bread. And forgiue vs our trespasses, as we forgiue them that trespasse against vs And leade vs not into temptation, but deliuer vs from euill. For thine is the Kingdome, the power and glory, for euer and euer.
            Amen.
         
         
            
            A Prayer and Meditation concerning the continuance of Gods corrections, notwithstanding our continuall humiliation, and daily Prayers vnto him, for comfort and reliefe.
            
            
               O Father, most mercifull and louing in Jesus Christ, what shall I bring vnto thée, whereby to appease thy wrath, conceiued against my sinne? If I should bring the sacrifice of Buls or Goates, thou art not delighted with them.
            Teach mée therefore, O Lord, teach me what to doe, to be reconciled vnto thée againe.
            I haue long called vpon thée, and that in the name of thy most beloued Sonne, and finde not that I haue long sought: I receiue not that I haue many dayes desired of thée: I haue long and earnestly knocked at the doore of

thy mercy, and finde no entrance for my Soule.
            I sée, I am shut out of thy presence: I wait, and am weary; I sigh, and sée no remorse; and lingring thus in distresse, I languish vnder the burden of thy displeasure, which séemeth to be so hetly kindled against mée, as I am ready to giue ouer my suite.
            For behold, Lord, my miseries are beyond measure, and my griefe groweth daily more and more, being of my selfe ignorant what to say more vnto thée, then I haue said: I know not what course to take, nor to whom to make my mone, direct mée and heare my prayers.
            Thou being angry with mée, all thy Creatures séeme to be also offended at mée, and nothing séemeth to yéelde mée comfort.
            Deare Father, what shall I doe? whither shall I flye to finde rest? there is no rest for me, but in thée: and therefore, vnlesse thou maiest be pacified with mée, I cry in vaine, I séeke, and finde nothing, and knocke, and féele no comfort.
            I haue nothing to giue thée, to redéeme thy fauour towards mée, for if I

had Mountaines of gold, if I had Riuers of Oyle, or ten thousand Sacrifices to bestow vpon thée, it booted me nothing, they are all thine owne.
            Accept therefore the Calues of mine vn
                  •
               ained lips, and the simple zeale of my sorrowful soule, and be at peace with mée in the mediation of thy all-sufficient Peace-maker, thy beloued Sonne, in whom thou delightest: Oh, heare mee for him, and reléeue me in him, without whom there can be no helpe for my soule, no case for my heart nor reliefe of mine estate: neither can inward comfort nor outward aide appeare, vntill thou be appeased with me in him.
            O vnhappy wretch that I am, that euer I offended so louing a God, that worketh all good for them that feare him: so wise a God, that can finde man out in his most secret waies: so watchfull a God, that considereth whatsoeuer man thinketh, heareth whatsoeuer man speaketh, and séeth whatsoeuer he doth: a God most powerfull, that for sinne can hurle downe the loftiest, and in loue can exalt the lowliest!
            O Lord increase our Faith.
         
         
            
            A fit and comfortable Meditation, when God seemeth most angry with vs.
            ALas, that euer I offended this great God, this God of all gods, this high King of all Kings: that God that preuaileth against mightiest mortall men,
            This God (alas) haue I offended, this God haue I stirred vp against me, and he in recompence of my sinnes maketh all his Creatures, as it were displeased with me also, and hardeneth the hearts of men against mee. The blessings and good things of the earth he with-holdeth from me, and instead thereof, he sendeth me a troupe of euils to afflict me.
            Alas, what shall I say vnto thée deare Father? what course can I take to helpe this? by this are my sorrowes encreased, and one euill followeth another, as waues in the Sea, I am weary to beare the burthen of so many calamities, and still I cry to mine offended God, in hope of helpe, but my hope quarleth, and I despaire: all my comforts are crossed with continuall troubles,

as if I were onely the man that had deserued to be punished aboue all other men.
            I would yet gladly appeale vnto my God, but I feare to be reiected againe. But shall I thinke it a fruitlesse worke, to repaire vnto my God, that of his owne accord calleth sinners to come vnto him? Is it bootlesse to fall downe before his Throne of mercy in prayer? may not mine vnfained cries at last preuaile with him, that is full of pitty?
            I will frame my heart to meditate, and my tongue to vtter what may please him: though I be a Sinner, I will goe vnto him, in the Name of him that he dearely loueth, that hée may be appeased, and looke vpon me againe in loue.
            He is a God all-sufficient, and can aswell behold and consider my inward faithfull desires, as hée séeth and obserueth what I haue done by ignorance or negligence, what I haue done contrary to his will.
            All that I thinke, speake, or doe amisse, hée noteth and writeth it vp in his remembrance, as with a Pen of Iron: Oh, why should he not also mercifully

consider, what I intend iustly to doe, though I cannot doe it, who hath promised to accept the Will for the Déede?
            Hée knoweth that I am but flesh: and what is flesh, but frailty it selfe? and what is man but a lumpe of naturall corruption and frailty?
            And wil this high Iehouah, this God so strong and powerfull, set hisforce so fiercely against a weak Worme? What conquest can there be in God against a silly man?
            But why reason I thus with my Maker? Why, rather doe I not lay my selfe do 
                  •
               ne vnto his will? if hée will afflict mée more, let it be so: if hée will punish me further, let it be so: if he will kill me, let it be so; for I am his, and he will doe with mée what hée listeth: there is no reasoning against him, there is no pacification of his displeasure by Art or Flatterie. It is not words that will worke my welfare with him: friends cannot defend me from his furie, nor take me out of the hands of so powerfull a God: no shield nor backler can preuent the stroake of his Rod.
            I will yéeld me 
                  •…
               erefore to his wil,

I will say vnto him, Lord, doe with me what thou wilt, turne me whither thou wilt, I will wait thy leasure, till the time shall come, wherein I may sée the issue of thy determinate purpose with me.
            And in the meane time I will consult with thy Word. I will therein exercise my selfe, and take comfort through hope; I will refresh my dulled spirits, with the dew of thy swéete promises, and laying aside all vaine expectation of fleshly aide, I will onely rest my selfe vpon thy protection, and in an assured resolution, I will séeke thée, being the Way, wherein who so walketh, shall at length attaine vnto perfect happinesse: the Truth, which who so imbraceth, shall neuer erre: and the Life, wherein who so liueth, shall neuer die eternally.
            O Lord increase our Faith.
         
         
            A Prayer against Despaire.

                  •…
                transgressed thy

holy Precepts, contemned thée our Lord and maker, & offended thy diuine Maiestie, greatly am I grieued in minde, and stand wonderfully in feare of thine euerlasting displeasure. And although thine holy Word doth tender vnto mée pardon and remission of my sinnes freely, through thy méere grace and mercy, yet haue I not grace as yet to apprehend the same, for busie is our most cruell and crafty aduersary, and doth labour to bring vs from all hope and comfort of saluation. The only remedy which wee haue against this our deadly aduersary, is, that wee neuer doubt of thy grace, and readinesse to forgiue our sinnes. Comfort vs at all times, especially at the houre of death, and giue vs grace to fasten all our confidence and trust on thee, and neuer to thinke my offence greater, then thou canst and wilt pardon.
            O louing and euer-liuing God, the liuely Fountaine of all grace, ouer-flowing the whole World with the Riuers of thy mercy: inlighten mine vnderstanding, increase my Faith, that I may truly know, and assuredly beléeue the Death and Merits of Christ thy Son, the least drop of whose most precious

bloud, shed for me, is of more efficacy and power to saue me, then all my enormities and hainous sinnes to condemne me. Looke vpon me (O my Sauiour) with those Eyes of pitty and fatherly compassion, wherewith thou diddest behold Peter, after hee denied thée, le

               t otherwise I despaire, and so commit the sin against the holy Ghost.
            Giue mée (Lord) the holy helpe of thy sacred Spirit, that when Satan doth accuse mée, and my Conscience beare witnesse against mée, when the cogitations of Hell and Death doe dismay me, when the snares of Death and horrible tentations would entrap me, when the whole World forsakes mée, and all things set themselues against mée, then strengthen mée, I beséech thée, that I forsake not thée my Sauiour, and fall from hope of thy frée mercy.
            O, comfort my heart with an inward assurance and seale of mine Adoption in thy Sonne, in whom the forgiuenesse of sinnes is promised vnto all Beléeuers. Call to memory thy holy Couenant entered into with vs, at our Baptisme, and the promise thereunto annexed, (Hee which beleeueth,

and is baptized, shall be saued,) and grant that wée may euermore consider the same, to our perpetuall comfort.
            Amen.
         
         
            A comfortable Prayer against back-sliding in Religion, and for increase of Faith: most worthy often to be said of euery Christian.
            O Almighty & Eternall God, which hast in thy Word commanded, that we should beware of falling from thy grace, and hast also witnessed that the end of those which goe backe from thy Word, after they haue once knowne the way of righteousnesse, will be excéeding fearefull: Haue mercy therefore on mee (O Lord) I most humbly pray thée, for I finde in my selfe great weakenesse, no power haue I of my selfe to perseuere in goodnesse: I beginne to wauer in my iudgement, and to grow doubtfull, euen of those things, which I heretofore haue embraced with fulnesse of perswasion: The exercises of godlinesse are not

so pleasant vnto me, as they haue béen, a strange kinde of dulnesse stealeth vpon me, and I haue no such life and spirit in matters of Religion, as in times past I haue had: and to what a wofull passe these things may come, though I haue much hope when I thinke vpon thy mercy, yet well may I feare, when I looke into my selfe. I confesse that thy goodnes is great, in that thou makest my heart within mee to smart for these things, and doest not suffer me to run on without stay, into that hellish and infernall Pit, in which I should be soone plunged, if thou shouldest once leaue mée to my owne weakenesse. Therefore (O Lord) I beséech thée, to quicken my dull heart, kindle those sparkes which are euen vpon quenching, and like vtterly to goe out, vnlesse it shall please thée to reuiue them: make strong my thoughts and conscience: make mée able more and more to sée the Truth in cases of Religion, and to discerne things that differ from the same. Giue mée vnderstanding to know both good and euill, giue mée also increase of zeale, that I may spring vp in grace, and thriue in godlines, vntil I come to that measure

to which thou hast appointed mee to come in Christ Jesus: let 
                  •
               eé not in these key-colde and decaying times, be carried away with euery blast of doctrine, through the subtiltie and wil
                  •
               nesse of those which lie in waite to beguile mée: suffer neither the cares of this vaine world, to wither and dry vp thy graces in mée, nor transitory pleasures to entrap mée, nor euill examples to misguide me, nor mine owne sloathfull and heauy nature to make mée grow weary of well-doing: but make mée so to burne in loue with heauenly things, that I may not satisfle myselfe with any measure, either of knowledge or practice, but may rather still be ashamed of my selfe, that I make no better procéedings, and so may euer desire and striue to more perfection.
            To this end, enkindle in mee affection more and more, by the hearing and reading of thy heauenly and holy Word, earnest praying, intentiue and feruent meditation, carefull watching ouer mine owne soule, following the example of godly men, and imitating their gracious and holy conuersation.
            
               
As thy promises (O Lord and most mercifull Father) haue encouraged mée thus to pray, so (I he séech thée) let it be thy gracious will to accept of these my humble petitions, which procéede from a contrite & a sorrowfull heart, so shall my soule magnifie thée, and my tongue set forth thy praises with ioyfull lips, and that in Jesus Christ thy Sonne and my Sauiour.
            Amen.
         
         
            A most Christian and comfortable Consultation, and sweete resolution, what course in time of deepest distresse men ought to take: worthy of all men to be considered, to their vnspeakable comfort.

            IT is a general complaint among the distressed children of men, that great and dangerous is the triall, to be long visited with the punishing hand of our high and powerful God, especially

notwithstanding the many instant cries, and humble petitions of the afflicted soule, who finding no ease, nor feeling any comfort, but contrariwise troubles & miseries, crosses & griefes to increase daily, thinking himselfe vtterly forgotten of God, or méerely to be hated of him: the silly afflicted soule thus bewrapped with feare, & féeling of his miseries, many times fainteth, and so falleth from faith in God, to séek succour at the hands of mortall men, and finding that to be a course of cold comfort, with whom neither prayers take place, nor endeauours preuaile, he then (pressed downe, as vnder the burden of vtter despaire of any succour) is moued oftentimes to frame his affections to contriue vnlawfull meanes, by his naturall and corrupt conceit, that his owne will and wit may shape some course to a hauen of more secure rest: and so hoysing the sayles of his owne peruerse imaginations, betaketh himselfe to the main sea of his vngodly deuices, t
                  •
               l at the length, instead of a happy hoped harbour, he suddenly sinketh, and is swallowed vp of the ougly deuouring gulfe of irrecuperable confusion. For the world, as a sea, tossing the

weake ones that saile therein, trieth the inclinations of all, and approueth and condemneth, but not according to the right rule of Christian reason, and godly wisedome, but after a sensuall manner of false iudgement, affirmeth, such as saile with a full fore-winde of prosperity here, to be onely blessed, happy, and beloued of God, and such as are becalmed with distresse and miseries, with crosses and calamities, and kéepe not the glorious way with the worldly-minded, to be hated and accursed of him. And this wretched and false censure of carnall men, driues many weake soules vpon the rocks of bitter ruine, euen when they dreame of a course of swéetest happinesse. For as Dauid found, Psalme 49. 18. much more this age affoordeth the experience, that men doe praise them that make much of themselues, namely, such as wallow in the delights and pleasures of the flesh. But them they estéeme mad men and fooles, and cast-awayes, and accursed, that liue in a base, and low, and poore, and ignominious estate, though neuer so contented: the foolishnesse of worldly men is wisedome, and the true wisdome of the

poore is foolishnesse, with the worlds flatterers. And this is that dangerous rocke, vpon which oftentimes euen the godly make shipwracke, when they consult with flesh and bloud, which argueth it the safest course, to become licentious, to imbrace vanity, and to studie the profitable and praised arts of flattery and dissimulation, to walke the broad way to preferment, to scale the wals of wealth and estimation by fraud and force, to leape ouer loue and lowlinesse (as dangerous blocks) and to sit in the seat of scorning the poore, with the proud and ambitious. And if the godly (such as haue professed knowledge and zeale) be driuen from their right course, by the winde of this vaine worlds Paralites, what becomes of such as haue no coasting card of Christian knowledge, nor néedle of faith to conduct them? And if such as haue the world vnder their féet, & can crush the poore in their fist, be easily carried away from̄ iustice and iudgement, to rapine and bribery, extortion and wrong; what a dangerous triall is it vnto the poore and distressed man, who euen for relieuing necessaries, is forced to bend his course to the

hauen of any small comfort? Yet this worlds wisedome censureth, that it is holden hardly lawfull for the poore to tread the steppes of the rich to relieue himselfe. Such an vnequall match there is betwéene these two, that for strength the one subdueth the other without great encounter; for wisdome, he stoppeth his mouth with faire words, Eccles. 9. 16. Because the world holdeth him wisest that is wealthiest, and him best that is brauest. The wisedome of the poore is despised, and his words are not heard. He is accounted most honourable, that can subdue the lowest with loftiest lookes: great men often speake what their hearts thinke not; and the poore pine in penurie, while the rich preach dissimulate plenty: the worst in their liues séeme most glorious in their liuings: the wicked increase in worldly wealth, while the poore doe perish. But sith it thus fareth with the dearest children of God, that they must be as cast-outs in the world and cast-awayes among worldlings; sith they haue no hope here, nor helpe, nor succour, nor pleasure, nor delight here, it is necessary that a carefull

consultation be had in such a dangerous warfare, how wée may be best def

               oode, though in meane measure to sustaine life, and ragges in simplest manner to couer the skinne) a course must be taken after the rule of right reason, wherein wée must leaue the sleights of the méere flesh, and leane to the aduice of the spirit; lest that, through a carelesse negligence, and negligent sluggishnesse, we be found authors and workers of our owne miseries.
            And to this end that all should be without excuse, and none should plead Gods iniustice or partiality, in punishing or correcting: God, the Father of all, hath sent proclamation and warrant to all to come to him. Such as are burdened, he will ease: such as are hungry, he will feed: such as are sad, he will comfort: and such as are in miserie, he will releeue. He then that complaineth, must complaine to him, he that praieth, must

               so in this generall warrant, that hee that will come to God, must depart from s
                  ••
               ne: wherein are comprehended two inseparable conditions: the one, that wée beléeue the premise of Gods protection: the other, that wée performe our duties in our calling: for without the latter, the first hath no ground: for wée cannot beléeue without the promise, and to the promise is tied obedience, and to this obedience, exercise of good things, the endeauours of vertue and godly life.
            And this cannot be without the blessing, which bringeth with it the timely supply of bodily necessaries here, and the true assurance of the ioyes to come in heauen, which also begin euen here, through the testimony of that liuely spirituall Comforter, which giueth inward contentation, in outward crosses, and outward reliefe in inward sorrow: it yeeldeth illumination to the dark vnderstanding, and quickneth the dull desires to doe good: it heaueth vs from the earth and vnhelping earthly things séene, to heauen

and heauenly society concealed: it turneth our carnall desires of workeing our owne wils, to the contemplation of diuine things, and maketh vs to séeke first that Kingdome which is aboue, as the principall end of our hope and happinesse, and then to séeke the things of this life, as things of necessity; and not to couet them, to be the more glorious here, but the more godly; not to be wealthy here, but rightly wise; not to be ambitious here, but humble, and content with a meane estate; not to fill our bellies with the gluttonous, but to séede, as fasting from all desire of superfluities.
            Being thus mortified in our affections, and furnished and adorned with the most sauory fruits of contentation in our estates, high or low, rich or poore, famous or base, wée cannot but walke patiently in our callings, and not to grudge at our miseries, be they neuer so great; wée cannot but be resolute Christians, and abide the encounter of the worlds furies, be they neuer so fierce and cruell: and therefore let vs be all of good courage, let vs fight the good fight, and stand as men. Flie not to idle and euill meanes to

reléeue our distresses, nor repine at the wealthy and wicked, that haue the winde of euery mans plausible Al haile, to driue them on from one proud conceit of themselues to another: for if it be duely weighed, what weight of vanities it heapeth on them (which as stabble in the end shall consume themselues with the fire of their guilty consciences) it will cause vs to leaue off to loue their liues, or long for the like: for their time is short and swéet (as a feast in a dreame) here; but in the end bitter, and for euer.
            And contrariwise, our miseries are but for a moment, and our ioyes perpetuall, and the smallest things (if we feare God) are better to vs then the greatest riches to the wicked. And though wee fall, wée shall not be cast off, for God supporteth vs with his hand.
            But the wicked shall be cast downe, and neuer be able to rise: though they flatter themselues in their owne eyes, while their wickednesse is found out, worthy to be hated and abhorred of all godly and vertuous men.
            Let vs therefore trust in the Lord, and not be idle in well-doing; and in

our déepest miseries, let vs wait patiently for the Lord, and not be weary: let vs hold fast by his promises, for though hée sée me to hide himselfe from vs, he will be found at length, and will grant and giue vs what is necessary for vs as children, and not what may make vs more wanton, as his Enemies, Worldlings and Reprobates: hée may suffer vs to lye among Lyons, for a season with Daniel, but hée will shut & close vp their deuouring lawes, that they shall not preuaile, till the Wicked come within their power, whom they shall teare in péeces without mercy.
            Hée may suffer vs a while to liue in the Wildernesse, as hée did his deare Dauid; but hee will bring vs home againe, to take comfort of our friends, and to comfort our families: he may suffer vs to be imprisoned long, as hée did Ioseph, but at the length hée will enfranchise vs, and turne it to our aduantage.
            And what if the wicked raile and reuile vs, as Shemei did Dauid? It may be, and surely the Lord will doe vs good for their euill, if wée can temper and mortifle our choller, and with

patience brooke their slanders: we may be sicke and diseased, yea twelue, or thirty yeares, with the woman and the man in the Gospell; but he can cure vs, or comfort vs, that it shall be easily borne. We may loose our goods, as Iob did, and become méerely vndone, as we thinke, and yet he will restore it, if we be patient and faithfull.
            God hath a time to correct, and a time to comfort, a time of triall, and a time of reward: he neuer faileth them that faint not, nor forsaketh them that forsake him not: hée may make vs mourne now, but he will make vs merry againe: though hée make vs wéepe now, he will take a time to wipe away our teares, and put them in a bottle, reseruing the remembrance of them till the end, when wée shall haue our portion with him in ioyes endlesse and vnspeakeable.
            And therefore wée that goe foorth with little séede, and sow it in sorrow, let vs wait, without wauering: for a plentifull increase will come, and a ioyfull haruest. We sée our beginning, and féele it hard and dangerous: but if we dwell in the land and grudge not, our end shall be ioyfull and glorious.

We haue but one day to labour, and then comes our hire: hée that calleth vs is sure, hée that promiseth is faithfull; what he speaketh, is Yea and Amen, as certaine as if it were presently done.
            Our naturall Fathers indéede may forget vs, and our familiar friends may forsake vs, and our enemies may threaten vs; but hée will take vs vp, stand by vs, and guard vs: he will foster vs and defend vs.
            As a Father fauoureth his Sonne, and as a Mother tendereth her infant; so doth our heauenly Father, and farre more dearely regard his children: yea, when hée séemeth to frowne, it is not in disfauour; when hée correcteth vs, he hateth vs not; when we thinke he leaueth vs to the raging waues of this worlds troubles, and when wée séeme to sinke, hée hath vs in his hand to hold vs vp: wée are alwayes in his sight, and he beholdeth all our wayes, and recordeth all our workes: our going forth, and our comming in, are in and by him, and he hath charged his Angels to watch ouer vs, and to guard vs from euils that lye in secret to deuoure vs: when wée rise vp, and when

wée lye downe, sléeping, or waking, he careth for vs: hée is the Watch-man of Israel, that slumbreth not: he is the Lion of the Tribe of Iuda, at whose voice the Wicked tremble, and by whose strength the Righteous stand.
            In our youth, and in our age, in our wealth, and in our want, in our life, and in our death, hée is alwayes ours, and neither the height aboue nor depth beneath, nor distance of place, can separate vs from him, nor hinder his presence with his Children; neither pouerty, nor sicknes, nor ignominy, nor misery, can estrange him from such as trust in him.
            Such a Father is he vnto the fatherlesse: such a Friend to the Friendlesse: such a staffe to the Weake, and such a Benefactor to the néedy, as no man truely trusting in him shall perish: hée heareth his Children, as in his bosome, and loueth them whom the World hateth: hée fauoureth them on whom the World frowneth: he embraceth them that the World retecteth: he cleareth them that the World accuseth, and saueth them that the World condemneth; his glorious, are in the World most base; his dearest, are in

the World disdayned. Not the most Rich, but the most Righteous, not the most Glorious, but the most godly; not the most Lofty, but the most Lowly in the world are dearest to him: hée preferred the poore Begger in h

               h wée haue riches vnséene, glory concealed, and infinite ioyes, & comforts vnspeakeable within, through the Comforter, which no man, but the Soule of the godly man can comprehend? Thus is the faithfull Soule fedde, thus is the Godly man relieued, and thus is the Childe of GOD preserued. And therefore, let vs that are poore and miserable, and despised in the World, be silent in the World, that hateth vs, and cry vnto God who heareth vs, because wee are his, and in his beloued hée loueth vs, hée can and will helpe vs, when most neede is, and in greatest perils shew his powerfull presence: hée came to Daniel, when the Lions would haue deuoured him: to the

thrée Children, when they should haue béene consumed with fire: to Susanna, when shée should haue béene vniustly condemned; to the Widdow of Sarepta, in her néede, and when all her oyle and meale was spent, he then renewed her store: he heard the groanes of Israel in Egypt; hée considered the desire of Anna in her silence; he saw Agar solit

               ry, and grieued in the Wildernesse: hee was with Dauid banished, with Eliah an hungred, with Sampson when he thirsted. And none, no not one, was euer disappointed of his hope, that continued constant vnto the end: though we silly Soules cannot comprehend his prouidence, nor limit his power, both which are alwayes working wonderfull things, and are neuer idle, euer perfect, and neuer defectiue in any thing, his will shall come to passe: he is onely wise, and all flesh fooles: he is onely strong, and all men weake: Princes are at his disposition: Kings are at his command, the raging Sea he calmeth, the dryest land he watereth, the hardest heart he bendeth, and the most Tyrannous he talmeth, as a Lambe, by his Word.
            May not this suffice to bring our

raging affections vnder, and worke such contentation in our miseries, as that we should thinke vs beholding to this powerfull Protector, and lay downe our necks to his will, and heartily and willingly waite his good time of renuing our estates? but if it be his will to kéepe vs alwayes low, and neuer to raise vs; alwayes poore, and neuer to releeue vs; alwayes distressed, and neuer to comfort vs with the comfort of this life, can we thinke that we through our small and short sufferings could deserue the high fauour of so preuailing a God, especially the ioyes that he hath laid vp in heauen for euer, for such as with Patience, and Faith, and Loue, and Obedience, and Well-doing, endure vnto the end.
            And therefore for our present resolution & comfort, let vs consider that we are not as the World deemeth vs, nor the Worldlings as the World esteemeth them. For we are in their eyes cast-awaies, but in our owne consciences, the childrē of God through Christ: and they, in their own conceits, blessed in their wealth, & wanton, and delicate, and loose liues; but by the Word of God, without repentāce, Reprobates▪
            
            
               
And therefore faith Christ vnto them; Woe be vnto you that are rich, for you receiue your consolation in this life. And againe, Weepe and howle, yee wealthy and worldly men, for the miseries that shall come vpon you. But vnto his little ones, such as are least estéemed in the World, he saith: Feare not, my little Children, I haue prepared for you a City. And againe, I will neither faile you, nor forsake you: What shall wée then say? The Lord is our portion, and our sure defence, why then should wée feare, what man can doe vnto vs? Esay 9. 7. The zeale of the Lord of Hoasts will performe this
            
            Let vs therefore rouze vp our soules that are dulled with our miseries, and let vs rest vpon him that is the God of mercies. Let vs be faithfull, patient, and humble? let vs only grieue that we haue sinned, and be fearefull to offend againe. Let vs fall downe before his foot-stoole, for he is holy: let vs cry to him, for hee is pittifull: let vs aske of him, for he is liberall: let vs referre vs to his will, for he is louing.
            O Lord increase our Faith.
         
         
            
            Here follow sundry most effectuall Prayers for distressed men, howsoeuer their trials continue or increase.
            
            
               When thou saydest, Seeke my face, my heart answered, Thy face, O Lord, will I seeke,
               
                  Psal. 27. 8.
            
            IT appeareth by this resolution of godly Dauid, that hée was moued by the Spirit of God in his troubles, to séeke aide from aboue, and not in the Earth; of God, and not of Man. And to the end that Dauids true affection which he bare towards the good of all Posterities, and especially the loue of God towards his Children, might be recorded to their perpetuall encouragement, it is continued euen vnto vs, that wée that are euen now afflicted, should sée, and as in a glasse behold the good will of God, wherein hée willeth vs to séeke his face: which importeth a most swéet encouragement, that all men troubled should séeke aide at God, who to the end that

this World, and the comforts thereof, should not allure his Children, lest they should be also miscarried thereby, and so be condemned with the World, hée setteth a veile (as it were) before their eyes, namely, pouerty, ignominy, crosses, miseries, and sundry calamities, that they delight not in the face and shape of this World, but that rather, it appearing vgly, and nothing pleasant vnto them, they might séeke another way to comfort themselues, namely; the most amiable face of heauenly Iehouah, who willeth vs, as hée did will Dauid, to séeke him onely in our distresse; that is, to call on him faithfully, to craue his fauour instantly, and to leade our liues vprightly. So shall his most louing countenance shine vpon vs, his hand be extended towards vs, and his power and might be with vs.
            And therefore as hée saith fréely, Séeke ye 
                  〈◊〉
               , let vs instantly and faithfully séeke him with our whole hearts: so shall wée be sure to sée his saluation, after wée haue patiently vndergone the swéete burden of the yoke of his fatherly chastisements.
         
         
            
               
               A Motiue to the Prayer following, for Patience in Affliction.
               
               
                  PErforce maketh a man patient against his will; but that cannot be called Patience, but a discontentment. But thatis Patience, when a man beareth all iniuries, wrongs, crosses, afflictions, and miseries, with a willing minde, without grudging or murmuring, without seeking or vsing any euill or sinister practice or attempt, to ease himselfe of that which God layeth vpon him, wherein he would seeme to be wiser then God, who knoweth better then the wisest man, what is best for him. And therefore Dauid giueth counsell, To wait patiently vpon the Lord, and to hope in him, in what estate soeuer we be, although we be poore and see others rich and prosper. Fret not thyselfe for him which prospereth in his wayes, Psal. 37. 7. Naturall reason is deceiued; when it conceiueth men happiest, that prosper most in the world: for then were the Word of God not true; which saith, Many are the troubles of the righteous
                        •
                     : and then were

the wicked in better case then the godly; for they prosper best in the world. But reade the 37. Psalme, their estate is there described, their end presaged, and the godly comforted, and confirmed in patience.
            
            
               A Prayer for patience in affliction, very comfortable.
               HEauenly Father, mercifull and louing, full of power, absolute in wisedome, vnsearchable in thy prouidence, and giuer of all diuine and spirituall graces, whereby thy children are guided in the way of Obedience, supported in their dangers, and relieued in their wants: whereby they learne to loue thée for thy mercies, to reuerence thée for thy greatnesse, and to obey thée for thy goodnesse; and in all the changes and alterations of their estates to imbrace Patience, whereby such as thou blessest, become thankefull, such as thou afflictest, become méekely contented, and beare the burden of their crosses without any outward shew of discontentment, or inward grudging or murmuring at thy

corrections, but depending vpon thy fatherly prouidence, they are either timely deliuered, or inwardly comforted, their hearts eased, and their consciences quieted, neuer presuming to limit the time when, or the manner, or meanes how, thou shouldest ease or reléeue them: but rest assured by thy Spirit working in their hearts, that they are thine, and therefore all things are promised by thée in thy Word, to work together for their good; sicknesse of the body, griefe of the minde, want of necessaries, enemies, and all crosses, all conioyne to worke good vnto those that are thine: and being hereof assured, they rest themselues in patience, and wait thy timely release for their miseries, in hearty obedience to thy will. And for that (most gracious Father) it is not the nature, nor in the power of man, to accomplish these heauenly duties; no, not in thine owne Elect: giue mée this heauenly vertue, Patience, to vnder-goe whatsoeuer thou shalt lay vpon mée with a willing and contented minde, acknowledging that I know nothing lesse then thy secret purpose, in working with man in this life, why thou aduancest one, and pullest

downe another: Why one prospereth, and another is miserable: knowing yet by thine own Word and Promise, that to such as are thine, all things turne to their good. And therefore I come vnto thée, who hast willed mée to come: I begge of thée, who hast willed mée to aske: and I knocke at thée, who hast willed mée to enter into thy presence, and all for Patience. Good Father, giue patience vnto my perplexed Soule, that howsoeuer I féele either inward griefe or outward troubles, I may rest me onely in thée and by thée, in peace within, howsoeuer the outward man séeme to perish. And let neither my fainting heart be cast downe, nor my spirit disquieted within mée, nor my conscience be difmayed at any of thy corrections. Lie my heart within mée reioyce: let my soule triumph, and my conscience retaine true peace and godly alacrity, in the middest of the causes of my déepest discontentments. And assist me, Lord, so with thy grace, that I may not onely séeme, but be indéede truely patient; and by the same thy grace, let Patience haue her true and liuely working in mée, bringing forth all other spirituall

effects of Obedience, all the fruits of thy sanctifying Spirit. Faith to beléeue, zeale to pray, and constant perseuerance in that hope, which maketh not ashamed. So shall all my tryals and temptations, crosses and afflictions worke for my good, to thy glory; and al my troubles be approued tryals of thy loue, and fatherly fauours toward me, howsoeuer the desires of flesh and bloud oppose themselues to weaken the swéete assurance setled in mée by a liuely féeling of thy promises, made in thy word, infinite in number, comfortable, and neuer failing. Plant therefore in me, O good Father, plant in mée these sauing fruits, and water them continually with the distilling dewe of thy sanctifying Spirit, that they may grow vp in mée, from the small and weake buds, that scarcely appeare in mée, to such liuely fructifying, and neuer-dying branches, as may beare in mée true testimonies vnto my selfe of mine assured Saluation, and future Glorification; and to thine Elect, encouragements of diuine imitation; and to the contrary minded, examples either to their reformation, or condemnation.
            
         
         
            
            A Prayer against the temptations of the Diuell.
            MOst mercifull God, and leuing Father, thy blessed World teacheth vs, that the old Dragon and subtle Serpent, our aduersary the Diuell, 
                  •
               uns about vs like a roaring Lion, séeking daily to deuoure vs.
            Hée vseth all his wicked sleights against our Soules, with an in finite number of diuellish Stratagems to make vs fall into sinne or despaire.
            He practiseth to entrap vs by riches, by pouerty, by voluptuous and wanton pleasures, by gréedy desire after honour, & worldly dignities, by coueting earthly goods and possessions, by care for the belly, and prouision therefore, with all other vnrighteous and sinfull affections and desires.
            Hée cunningly doth cast abroad his daits and snares to intangle vs, night and day, in our words and workes, so that wake we or sléepe we, he is before or behind vs to deuoure vs.
            O glorious God, who can escape?

for he is continually watching, and neuer at rest, and wée are weake and vnable of our selues to resist.
            Open thou our eyes (O Lord) that we may comprehend how mighty and crafty our enemie is. Confirme our Faith, for we are not to fight against flesh and bloud, but against Sathan, the vtter enemy of the Soule, therefore (O faithfull Father) haue compassion on vs.
            Make vs strong in the power of thine owne streugth, put vpon vs thy defensiue armour to resist manfully the temptations, and subtle deuices of the Diuell.
            Giue vs thy weapons: gird our reynes with the Girdle of truth, put on our brests the Brest-plate of righteousnes, let our féete be shod with Euangelical peace, and aboue all things let our hearts be defended with the shield of Faith, so shall wée be sure to quench all the fiery darts of the diuell, so that our hearts be couered with the Helmet of Saluation, and our hands hold fast the Sword of the Spirit, which is, thy most sacred, an

               The Motiue to the first Prayer in distresse: Being a Confession of sinnes, and a Petition to be released of the punishments due for the same.
               
               
                  DAngers and afflictions moue poore men to repaire vnto God, not onely in their silent sighes, as Anna and Moses did, but also in their vnfamed zeale, vsing the meanes, the tongue and lips, in crying vnto the Lord,

who willeth vs to aske, and enioyneth vs to waite, vntill his good time be to giue what we desire.
               And for that God heareth not sinners, here is inserted a Confession and Prayer for forgiuenesse, that our vnworthinesse may be put away, and our vnaptnesse turned into true submission, and our coldnes into zeale, that the Spirit of God being renewed within vs, through our humiliation and prayer, we may not faint, but liue in hope, and vndergoe the correction of our louing God, in what manner, and for what time heseeth it fit for vs, without indenting with him what to doe for vs, or when to come to vs, because he is wise, and we our selues fooles: he is mercifull, and neuer faileth, nor forsaketh the miserable.
               God is loue, and imbraceth them that deserue to be hated. And therefore he
                     •
                   beareth with our imperfections, and accepteth vs righteous, being vnrighteous; worthy, being vnworthy of our selues. And in this hope and assurance, is this prayer following, to be faithfully vsed, and it shall comfort the soule of the most sorrowfull.
               
                  
                  The way truely to seeke our God, is to doe iustly, to loue mercy, to humble our selues, and to walke with him.
                  
               
               Reioyce in hope, be patient in tribulation, continuing in Prayer,
               
                  Rom. 12. 12.
            
            
               The first Prayer in distresse.
               O Father, full of knowledge, thou searchest the hidden thoughts of all hearts, thou beholdest the desires, euen of such as kéepe silence: But yet thou requirest that thy children should know and confesse thée to be their Father, and so to iudge of thy workes, as that thou hast framed in man an heart wherewith to beléeue, and a tongue and lips, whereby to confesse thée to be his louing Father, and dost challenge at his hands, the Sacrifices of Prayer and Praise continually.
               Thy children must not be dumbe in

their Soules, nor mute in their lips, that want thine aide: no, thou commandest them to aske, séeke, and knocke, ant she west thy selfe ready to heare, ready to be found, and ready to receiue thy distressed ones, who are faithfull and patient, and perseuere vnto the end.
               And therefore, deare Father, I (beset with many miseries) come vnto thee, as vnto the chiefe fountaine of all rest and reliefe, inward and outward: but I am st
                     •
                  full, and that I confesse, and thou wi
                     ••
                   not heare such as are defiled with iniquity: the wicked cannot finde thée, and the vniust cannot come before thy presence.
               Alas, what shall I then doe, being so vnfit to aske, so vnapt to séeke, and so vnworthy to receiue what I desire, by reason of my sinnes?
               But cleanse mée, O Father most pure, and sanctifie mée, O thou most holy: teach mee what to speake vnto thée, for I cannot keepe silence, my griefes are great, and my miseries increase more and more: I must therefore speake: O shape in mée a new Spirit, giue me a renewed heart, and a tongue that may speake acceptable

things vnto theé: that thine eares may be opened at my cries, and thy mercies (O Lord) ready to receiue my humble complaints.
               Thine eyes (O Lord) are open vnto the cries of all that feare thée, and relicuest al that trust truly in thée, thou deliuerest their soules from death, and comfortest their hearts in the time of sorrow.
               And therefore doth euery man that is godly, make his prayer vnto thée, and holdeth not his tongue, hée may 
                     •
                  use and meditate for a time at his miseries, but at the length the fire of zeale will enkindle, and he cannot but speake with his tongue, and cry vnto thée, to shew his hope, that hée hath an helper in heauen: he cryeth, and thou considerest: he desireth, and thou relieuest: he beléeueth, and at the last, thy mercy and goodnes appeareth, and thou imbracest him with ioyfull and timely deliuerance.
               And how commeth it to passe (O mercifull Lord) that I so long haue sought thée, and thou séemest to hide thée from me? How long haue I prayed vnto thée, and thou séemest to giue no 
                     •
                  are vnto mée? which maketh mée

weary, and almost ready to faint, and to giue ouer my suite, which I haue so long sought, and made vnto thée, O God, my Strength, and my Redéemer.
               But loe, O Lord God, thy promises and louing kindnesse do only 
                     •
                  éede and nourish me with a continuall and neuer dying hope, that the time expected will come at the last, when thou forgetting my sinnes, wilt both heare me, and fully deliuer me.
               Thou art God, and therefore good: thou art the Father of all, and therefore onely, thou knowest the wants of all thy children, and the things most fit to giue vnto them, and the time when to bestow it on them.
               And therefore, Father all-sufficient, and full of loue, I presume not to say vnto thée, Come now, or Doe this, but for the time when, and the thing what thou wilt work for me, I refer to thée, yet be not ouerelong away: for thou knowest my séeblenesse, and my miseries, and how néere I am brought to an vnrecouerable fall: what shall I doe, Lord, but hope onely in thée?
               Thy Prophet witnesseth vnto vs wretched men, that when the righteous

cry, thou hearest them, and deliuerest them out of all their troubles.
               But who is righteous, O Lord? who is cleane? he also witnesseth that none is righteous, none is cleane, but all are sinners: yea, our most holy fathers were impute in thy sight, and yet they receiued the Promise, and obtained grace and mercy, and reliefe, and strength, and saluation at thy hands.
               But, Lord, they were thus comforted and thus blessed, and thus relieued onely of thy frée 
                     •
                  auour (wherein thou acceptedst them righteous, and imputedst not sinne vnto them) and not of their deseruings.
               Thou art loue, and in loue thou imbracest them, that deserue to be hated for their sinnes; and therefore sith thou art so full of compassion, and so infinite in thy mercies, beare with mine imperfections, and couer my sins; accept me righteous, and I am righteous: accept mée worthy, and I am worthy to receiue the good things of thy loue, which is without all limitation.
               Hold me righteous in the righteousnesse of thy beloued, that I also may

be heard when I cry, as my righteous Fathers were, and let me be deliuered out of my distresses, as the righteous haue béene deliuered out of all their troubles.
               For, what can it profit thée (O Father) to forsake me vtterly, and to suffer me to be forsaken of all, as if thou haddest no respect vnto mine offering? I cry daily, and yet my trouble continueth: I séeke thée, and am depriued of all earthly blessings.
               O wretch that I am, what shall be the end of my complaint? I will cry yet, if thou wilt heare: I will séeke thée still, till thou maiest be found: be it as thou wilt, into thy hands I commend mée, and to thy prouidence I commit mine estate most grieuous, and best knowne vnto thy selfe.
               O Lord increase my Faith.

               The Motiue to the second Prayer, to be said of distressed men.
               
               WHerein the poore man desireth God to consider in mercy his temptations, which are so much the more heauy and grieuous, because the worldly minded doe taunt at him for his afflictions; affirming that God hath forsaken him, for that hee punisheth him so deepely. And the poore man hauing no other refuge, but to flye vnto God, i
                     •
                   encouraged through Gods promises, and perswaded through faith, that these men speake so hardly of him, for that they sauour not of the true knowledge of Gods louing corrections, whereby hee visiteth his dearest Children here for a time, that they perish not eternally: and resolueth himselfe to holde fast by God, and therefore prayeth for strength; and withall, he desireth the assistance of Gods directions in the gouernment of his life and actions, lest that such as see his pouerty and afflictions, should see him fall from God by grosse sinnes, and so take the stronger

occasion to censure him iustly punished for his wickednesse. Yet withall hee confesseth vnto God, that hee is indeede a sinner, and for his sinnes iustly touched with crosses, by the meere prouidence of God in loue, and taketh comfort by examining his waies, & his will, which although they be not so right as they ought, yet in respect he erreth through frailty, not by a full consent, rather as a sufferer by Satans oppressions, then a wilful doer against the will of his Maker: hee desireth God to looke vpon him in the merite of Christ, and in him prepare his dull heart to repentance, and his whole man to a more sincere course of life: that his wayes being reformed by the word of Truth, his hard afflictions may be in the end, and by little and little, mitigated, and that God will breake the fetters of griefe and sorrow, and according to his diuine Promises, by his deliuery, giue him occasion to sing a new song, a song of ioyfull deliuerance, both from the tyranny of Sathan, and also from the heauy burthen of his afflictions.
            
            
               
               The second Prayer for Constancy in affliction, and to endure malicious slanders patiently.
               LOrd, how are my troubles increased? how many and how grieuous miseries haue seized & taken hold vpon mée? insomuch as the world argueth me forsaken of thee: aff
                     •
                  rming that there is no helpe for me in thée.
               But, Lord, are they not such as haue a carnall eye, and doe not spiritually discerne thy secret purposes, in chastifing them whom thou louest?
               They looke onely vpon the outward meanes that the world worketh, and comprehend not thy mercy and prouidence, wherein thou workest, by means without meanes, and against meanes, euen as thou wilt.
               Therefore, let not their malice moue me, nor their taunts dismay me: I will hold me by thy promises, and endeuour to kéepe thy Statutes, and performe what thou hast commanded.
               O Father, leade me in thy righteousnesse, that I sinne not in their sight that couet to catch me in the snare, and

                   ap me in the net of deserued reproofe. Beare me vpon the wings of thy blessed protection, and let mée not come within the reach of their malicious inuentions.
               Let not such as lay wait for mée, haue iust cause to desire, or opportunity to worke any euill against mée: rather let me so trend the pathes of that loue, and performe that duety to all men, that thou hast willed in thy word, that my conscience bearing me witnes of mine innocency, I may fréely say, The Lord is my helper, no euill shall happen vnto me.
               
               I confesse, that I cannot so carry my selfe in this life, but offence w
                     •
                  ll be taken against mée, and I shall deserue (as I doe) the iust reproofes of men, yea, against my will: and consequently, the carnally affected cannot but breake out into bitternesse against me for the same, and the more, by reason they sée me afflicted, as it were by thy hand, which they take as a strong argument, that I am a sinner most notorious, and that thou hast vtterly cast mée off foreuer.
               I cannot indeede (louing Father) but confesse my sinnes, and that I am

worthy of sharper corrections, the
                     •
                   I haue yet tasted, or am able to beare: yet consider that I haue not maliciously done what thou dislikest, but in weaknesse, and of naturall imbecility onely, and much against my will, rather as suffering Sathans oppressions, then willingly or wilfully committing sin.
               And therfore trust I in thy mercies, O forgiue me: I depend on thy power, O saue me and deliuer me, lest my miseries ouer-whelming me, such as pretend euill against me, take occasion to pursue me, and so d

                  uoure me.
               Consider my troubles, O Lord, behold my dangers, and be vnto me a perpetuall rest and refuge.
               Why standest thou aloose, O Lord, and séemest not to regard my t
                     •
                  oubles? why turnest thou away thy face, and considerest not my wants? thy hidest thou thy selfe, when my troubles so much abound?
               Arise, and let not the wicked take occasion through mine afflictions, to say, there is no helpe for me in thée, or that thou regardest not the causes of thy distressed children.
               Deliuer me rather, and reléeue me, that the righteous perceiuing thy readinesse

to saue me, may the more feare thée, and trust in thee, and not 
                     •
                  aint when they are likewise afflicted.
               Thou willest the poore to commit himselfe vnto thée, and promisest to relieue such as haue no helper. Thou preparest the dull hearts to call vpon thée, & thou againe hearest their cries, and comfortest them.
               How long then, O Lord, how long wilt thou forget me? how long shall I cry and not be heard? how long shall I seeke counsell of thee, and yet be ignorant what course to take? I am wearied with my daily sighes and groanes, which my heart (fraught with griefe and heauines) doth powre forth before thée continually. O be vnto mee that liuely light, that may lighten my sad and pensiue Soule. Send that Comforter vnto me, whom thou hast promised to send, that hee may teach mee what to doe in this my miserie.
               Thou hast threatned to increase the sorrowes of such as seeke vnto other gods, why then should they continue still miserable, and heauy, and grieued, that seeke thee onely, and onely beleeue in thee? how shall they be

still ignorant that aske counsell and wisedome of thee, who hast created all in the beginning, and doest preserue all, and maintaine all for euer, being God onely powerfull, prouident, and louing?
               To thée I only come, on thee I onely call, thee I onely seeke: with thee is mercy, and with thee is right Redemption, and thou deliuerest all that trust in thee, as a most sure Sauiour, and mighty Protector.
               And thy Word expresseth the liuely force of thy loue and power, wherein thou keepest them that are thine, as the apple of thine est, and couerest them with the wings of thy sauour, from the mercilesse and cruell men.
               O be therefore my Rocke, whereon I may safely rest: be thou my strong Castle, wherein I may be freed from the dangers prepared against mee: for thou hast promised, that all such as hope in thee, shall be as Mount Sion, that shall neuer be moued.
               Breake thou my fetters (Lord) wherewith I am tyed, and remoue my sorrowes, wherewith I am brought euen to the doore of death, that I walking in the liberty of a free spirit, may

grieue no more at my crosses, but glorifie thee with a song of ioyfull deliuerance.
               Let not sinne preuaile against mee any more, which as a Lyon, teareth in peeces the assurance of my soule.
               Beare me vpon thy sauing wings, through the miseries of this life, and let not the Mire and Clay, wherein I sticke fast, detaine mee euer: let not the Water-flouds which roare fearefully, and fiercely swell against me, vtterly swallow mevp. But rather diuide and put backe the mercilesse Waues, that so dangerously rage on all sides against me, that I may passe on, and finish this my mortal course, as one that liueth, and hath his being of thy meere loue, and not as one that languisheth in thy displeasure.
               O Lord increase my Faith.
            
            
               
               The Motiue to the third Prayer.
               
               VVHerein the poore Man disclaymeth his owne worthinesse, and appealeth to the mercies of God; yet grieued vnder the burthen of his miseries, he instantly prayeth vnto God, that he will not correct him ouer-sharpely, lest he faint. For by reason of his grieuous crosses, (not withstanding his continuall prayers) he feareth (as it were) lest hee pray in vaine, and be driuen to thinke that either God heareth him not, or regardeth not his Petitions: and therefore beseeching God to come now at the length, either with deliuery, or to giue him such inward spirituall strength, as hee may constantly indure vnto the end. For hee hauing tryed the helpe of mortall men, findeth it to tend onely to words, and not to relieuing workes; assuring himselfe, that God is not as Man, that promiseth and performeth not, but is absolute, to worke by meanes, against meanes, and without meanes, euen what hee will for his; setting before the eye of his hope, Gods former fauours and

fatherly assistance, shewed vnto our faithfull Fathers of old; by whose example hee seemeth to challenge at the hands of God the like louing kindnesse, and that God will not suffer him vtterly to perish, putting his trust in him, although the World gaze on him and deride him, as if he were a Monster, and no man: expostulating, as it were with God, that forasmuch as hee was cast vpon him, as soone as hee was borne, & he onely depending on his mercies, he cannot leaue him in the deepe, but rather, for his owne glories sake, lift him out of his calamities, lest the Righteous faint also to see him still visited, notwithstanding his continuall Prayers: and that the wicked should thereby gather, that there is not a God that regardeth the causes of poore Men.
            
            
               The third Prayer: wherein he flyeth, and wholly relyeth vpon God, and trusteth not in the helpe, nor feareth the hurt of men.
               
               O Lord, I cannot excuse mine euils, they are infinite in mine own eyes,

and many as grosse which I haue forgotten, & sleightly past ouer, as if they were no sinnes before thee: and therefore I appeale vnto thy mercy for all: for by mine own deseruing or satisfaction, I can cleare my selfe of none at all.
               Who can rehearse or call to memory, all that he hath done amisse before thee, who keepest account of the least sins? And therfore what auaileth it me to iustifie my selfe, if I knew nothing by my selfe? It is thou that seest and iudgest: it is thou that hast found matter enough to condemne me, and cause enough to punish me: & therfore I haue no means to be freed from thine anger, and consequently from my miseries, but thy mercy onely, in thy beloued Christ Jesus.
               Correct me not therefore, deare Father, as I deserue, but in him haue compassion vpon me: and as for my reformation, thou beatest mee with thy rod, so for my preseruation, hold me vp by thy staffe, that I be not confounded vtterly, or perish altogether.
               Thou seemest as if thou hadst vtterly forsaken mee: Oh, why art thou so farre from me in the wofull time of my troubles? Why stoppe
                     •
                  t thou thine

eares at my cry? Why dost thou turne away thy face, when I offer the sacrifice of praier vnto thee, and seemest not to regard mee, though I put my trust wholly in thee?
               O come, Lord, come now at the last, performe thy promises of aid and comfort, when most neede is: for vaine are the helps of flesh, weake is mans arme, and his heart is not right in equity and iudgement: therfore I trusting in thee onely, let me not be disappointed of my hope: let me not goe mourning, by reason of my miseries, and neuer finde reliefe at thy hands.
               Our Fathers trusted in thee, they called vpon thee in their troubles and dangers, and were deliuered and freed from that which oppressed them: they prayed vnto thee, and were heard: they fought thee, and thou shewedst thy selfe a helping Father vnto them, euen when they were ready to be swallowed vp of mercilesse waters.
               Great was thy fauour towards all our beleeuing fathers: but alas, Lord, what am I? I am a Worme and no Man, yet I beleeue, Lord, helpe mine vnbeliefe: I am couered with shame, be thou my glory, that I may glorifie

thée among the people that now contemne me, because thou séemest to hide thy face from me.
               I am gazed on, and derided, scorned, and despised, because of my miseries: my neighbours that should assist mée, disdaine me: my familiars that should comfort me, doe not onely forsake mée, but say of mée, that all my hope is in vaine: my kinsfolkes who should aide me in my necessities, adde griefe vnto my miseries, and tauntingly say, I am deseruedly fallen, and cannot rise againe.
               Oh behold this, thou that sittest on high, consider this, and instead of these miseries (increased by such as should friendly visit mée) stand thou by mée, and afford me the cup of thy saluation, that I tasting of it, may answere these men, and say, as I am assured that my Redéemer liueth, euen thou my God, mercifull and all-sufficient, who art one and the same for euer.
               I was cast vpon thée as soone as I was borne, and thou receiuedst mee: But the faults of my youth, and the sinnes of my riper yeeres, haue caused a diuorce betwéene thy loue and my lewd life. I am sorry, deare Father,

J am sorry for my fault, take me again into the bosome of thy fauour: and from hence forth be present with me againe, and let me only ioy in obeying thée, and let my soule take comfort of thée, and my whole man be relieued by thée; for besides thée I haue no helper.
               Oh helpe thou mée, and restore mée to comfort againe: banish all mine afflictions as a mist, and refresh my soule with the timely dew of thy reliete, powre downe the swéete drops of thy quickning Spirit, and let a comfortable calme follow the fearefull stormes of this dangerous tempest.
               And I will yéelde thée the praise, who art worthy of all praise, I will magnifie thy name that workest wonderfull things, and bringest to passe that which the worldly ones cannot comprehend; I will declare thy name for euer among the children of men. The righteous shall heare it, and be glad, and the wicked shall quaile to sée me restored, whom they so long haue scorned, and deemed a cast-away, because of my miseries.
               For thine owne names sake therfore, O Lord my God, heare my prayers, consider my meditations, helpe mée in

time conuenient, before I shall vtterly, lest the righteous be discouraged by my decay, and the vngodly take heart to perseuere the more in their obstinate and malicious wayes, whilest they imagine there is not a God, that respecteth the miseries of his distressed Children.
               O Lord increase our Faith.
            
            
               The Motiue to the fourth Prayer.
               
               
                  WHerin the poore man sheweth his accustomed constancy and faith. And feeling the weight of his crosses yet heauy, prayeth that he may not be vtterly consumed, nor that his enemies preuaile against him, but rather God will furnish him with such ability, as he may pacifie them in paying all men their due: and the rather, for that many doe looke vpon his dangers, both the wicked & the godly, the one in derision, the other in griefe. These yet expect what will be the issue of the poore mans crosses.

But the godly wishing it to be comfortable, he prayeth that they may see it come to a wished end, for conformation of their hope in the like dangers: and because the poore man findeth his owne infirmities, hee prayeth for strength, and seeing his owne ignorance, prayeth for knowledge, and looking into his dulnesse, & cold inclination to good things, prayeth for feruency and zeale: knowing assuredly, that there is no way to attaine vnto deliuery from thraldome, but to walke rightly before the Lord, who is ready to set the iust vpon a sure rocke, against which the wicked cannot preuaile. And although Father, Mother, Kinsmen and Friends forsake him, he is assured the Lord supplieth them all, and by the experience hee hath of the Lords readinesse to helpe, hauing vpholden him in former dangers, he will not faile him, nor forsake him, when he is ready to be swallowed vp of most mercilesse troubles.
            
            
               
               The fourth Prayer: wherein he prayeth for faith, for zeale and strength, to vndergoe Gods corrections, and to be deliuered from the dangers prepared against him.
               
               LOrd, I lift vp mine heart vnto thoe, my soule trusteth in thée, let me not be confounded: let not men haue their desires against mée: let thy blessings be powred downe vpon mee, let thy cup of comfort and saluation be filled vnto me, and let thy right hand be ready and outstretched to hold mee vp, and in thy prouidence furnish me with the hid treasures of thy loue.
               So shall I sit safely vpon a sure rocke, and be furnished with such things as may pacifie such as now are importunate with mee for that which I cannot performe: and resting in danger of their cruelties, haue no other refuge, but to depend on thy mercy and prouidence, wherein (as in a safe sanctuary) I shall rest euermore preserued, vntill these dangers be ouerpast.
               
                  
Many doe looke vpon me, to sée and consider what will become of my miseries, and I continually pleade thy frée mercy in Christ, wherein thou promisest to couer the multitude of my sins, for which I am thus afflicted: the righteous thereby take hold of hope, and in my behalfe wish a prosperous and happy end of my destres, encouraging mee to perseuere; for that thy word, euer sure, warranteth a timely deliuery of all such as are penitent, patient, and faithfull vnto the end.
               But alas, good Father in Christ Jesus, I a most sinfull man, doe challenge no comfort, ease, or reliefe in mine owne right, but in the merits of him, in whom thou art well pleased, and in whom thou shewest mercy vnto sinners, among whom I am the greatest.
               Yea, Lord, I am ignorant of good things, and wander as a beast, by nature, in the vast wildernesse of this worlds vanities, hauing little or no taste of thy sauing truth, or féeling of future dangers; but of thée onely I haue knowledge, of my selfe I am weake, but from thee I haue all strength; of my selfe is misery, from

thée is mercy, of my selfe. I am altogether vnperfect, but from thée is all perfection, both inward, tending to the consolation of my said soule, and outward, to the reliefe of my distressed body.
               Therefore teach me, O Lord, teach me thy truth, shew me thy wayes, and leade mee in thy pathes continually: withhold my heart from euery euill thought, & my hands that they commit no euill, kéepe mine eyes sincere, and my tongue that it speake no vnséemely thing, and my féet from falling.
               Regard moe not as I am in mine owne selfe, nor deale with me as I deserue by mine owne wayes, but according to thy tender mercies and louing kindnesse banish my sinnes as a mist, driue away my imperfections as a cloud, and supply my wants with timely reliefe.
               Thou art righteous and gracious, and reformest sinners, and forgiuest their sins. Be mercifull therefore vnto mine iniquities, for they are very great. Kéepe my soule and deliuer me, let mee not be confounded, nor perish vtterly, for I trust in thée.
               Thou art the light of my saluation,

the strength of my life, and my refuge, and sure defence in trouble.
               In the time of my greatest dangers, thou shalt hide mee in thy tabernacle, namely, in the secret places of thy prouidence, which no man can finde out: thou shalt kéepe me, and hide me from them that couet my destruction: thou shalt set me vpon a rock, against which man shall not preuaile.
               Harken therefore, O Lord, harken vnto my voyce, when I cry vnto thée, haue mercy vpon mee, and comfort mee.
               Thou sayest, Seeke yee my Face: And what is it, O Lord, but to séeke thy helpe in distresse and danger? to craue thy fauour and succor in the time of néede.
               O Father, my soule (by the priuiledge of thy frée Spirit, which teacheth truth in the inner parts) is ready; my heart also is prepared to séeke thée: my tongue speaketh vnto thée, as vnto the liuely helper of all that are oppressed.
               Hide not therefore thy face in displeasure, which in loue thou willest me to seeke: be vnto me as heretofore thou hast béene, my succour and shield,

and leaue me not vnto the end.
               My naturall father indéede that begat me, and my mother that bare mee, may forget mée, my friends that pretend to fauour mee, may forsake mee, when thou rebukest me, but thou canst not forget mée, nor forsake mee; for thou in thy Word hast promised the contrary; and therefore I will not feare to flye vnto thée, who giuest what earthly fathers cannot giue, and supplyest my wants, that neither my most familiar and my dearest friends can supply.
               I should vtterly faint, did I not verily trust in thée, and assuredly know that thou hast no respect of persons, and that thou acceptest not of men, as the world doth, by the outward habite and externall glory, but the inward parts, decked with faith, feare, and obedience thou likest, and embracest the poorest for pietie, and in the proud whom the world doth reuerence, thou hast no delight.
               Frame thou therefore mine inward zeale, and let not my outward basenes ouer-much depriue me of some comfort among the children of men; and when I cry vnto thée, be not as men, who

regard not the poore; but with spéede heare and consider, and refuse not to answere me with timely reliefe.
               And let not the vnsauorie miseries of this life, accompanied with the naturall we akenesse of my flesh, draw me into the way of the wicked, but let me rather hold fast by thy promised protection, as by the Altar of a liuely

               Thou hast séene my troubles, and hast knowne my soule in the bitternes of distresse, and yet thou hast not vtterly forsaken mée, but in mercy hast mightily preserued mee from infinite perils.
               And now, Lord, euen now, séeing my life wasteth in heauinesse, and my yéeres consume in forrow: sith I am a reproach euen among my neighbours, and all my friends faile me: and sith I am euen at the point to perish, be pleased to thinke of my miseries, and send me spéedy reliefe.
               
                  
As thy goodnesse, O Lord, is great, which thou hast laid vp as in a treasury, for all that feare thee: so let thy mercy appeare, and thy prouidence and power toward me, be séene, among such as thinke indéede thou hast forsaken me vtterly.

               The Motiue to the fift Prayer.
               
               VVHerein the poore man appealeth vnto God, being stricken with a kinde of despaire, because there be that say of him. There is no helpe for him in God: he therefore not onely cryeth vnto God, that he will consider it, but he himselfe also entreth into the cause, why they so say, and findeth it to be, for that they see his store consumed, and his basket emptied, and his foes furious against him: but hee herewith not dismayed, reasoneth against these mens infidelity; who, in these their allegations seeme to deny, that either there

is a God, or that he careth for, or will, or can helpe the poore. And yet hee presumeth not vpon his owne integrity, but confesseth God to be iust, and rightly may punish sinners, among whom he is the greatest: and hee finding this temptation to be very grieuous, he prayeth God to second his feeble nature, by his free grace, and that he will stay him with his staffe, while he correcteth him with his rod, because he is but a weake man, & may easily be burdened aboue his owne strength. But being assisted by God, hee assureth himselfe, that no arme of flesh can preuaile further against him, then shall be profitable for him: nay, he is assured that it shall come so to passe, that euen they that most vpbraid him, shall acknowledge the mighty hand of God in deliuering him, and therefore determineth to wait the good pleasure of God, when and how it shall come to passe, and will not be discouraged though men say, There is no helpe for him in God.
               
            
            
               
               The fifth Prayer, wherein the poore man prayeth God to keepe him from despaire, howsoeuer men goe about to make him afraid.
               IN thee, O Lord, I put my trust, and yet there are that say, There is no helpe for mee in thée: but thou art my God, how say they then, Thou canst not helpe me? sith thou art most louing and absolutely al-sufficient.
               I am indéed brought low and much weakned, I haue no helper among the sons of men. This they consider, that say, There is no helpe for me in thee.
               
               They perceiue that my baiket is empty, they sée that my store is consumed, and therefore they say, There is no helpe for me, nor recouery of mee by thee.
               
               I ponder these their words, O Lord, in my heart, and kéepe silence: I consider their thoughts, yet faint I not: I marke what they speake of mee, and yet I despaire not, for thou art my God, that canst defend me, my Father that ca
                     •
                  st restore me and sustaine me,

thou art to mée all in all: how say they then, There is no helpe for me in thee?
               
               Do not these men say in their hearts, Thou art not God, that thus diminish thy power? and that thou art either vnable, or vnwilling to helpe the néedy, and to vphold thy distressed children? But as thou knowest them liers, so make them know their vaine conceits, by some sure token, that thou neuer faiisst them for euer, that perseuere constantly, and trust truely in thée vnto the end.
               Thou art indéede a iealous God, and punishest such as go
                     •
                   astray; yet thou art a louing God, and callest thy chosen children from their euill waies, by a gentle correction.
               And therefore foolish and vnadussed are they, that measure thy fauour towards men, by the fulnesse of good things, tending to the saciety of fleshly desires, and thy displeasure by want and affliction, that thinke that thou louest them, that thou féedest fat with the plenty of worldly riches and pleasures of this life, and hatest them that are low by crosses and corrections.
               And great is this temptation (good father) vnlesse thou second our féeble

natures by thy grace, being touched with thy correcting hand, stay me therfore, O stay me, with thy staffe, whilest thou smitest me with thy punishing rod.
               Lay not vpon me wretched man, a more heauy burthen then I shall be able to beare. And though thou sée it most conuenient for me to suffer want, afflictions, crosses, and reproaches in this life, to the end that I be not miscarried with the pleasing vanities of this World, yet withall consider, that I am but a man, weake and vnapt to beare the yoake of ouer-sharpe trials, without such supply of thy blessed comfort, inward and outward, as may maintaine faith and bodily necessaries in me, and for me.
               So shall I reioyce in my low estate, and no calamity shall bring mee into despaire of thy prouident protection: I shall be assured that thou art indéede my God, and that whatsoeuer men say of me to the contrary, thou art & wilt be my helper, in the time of my greatest néede.
               And then shall it come to passe, that euen these men shall sée how great thy goodnesse is, which thou hast in store

for them that feare thee, and thy mercy, which thou shewest them that trust in thée, euen in the sight of the sonnes of men.
               They shall sée and behold, how thou doest séeme to expose thy children, as it were, to the furie and rage of the worlds miseries, and yet doest hide them as in a sacred Sanctuary, a place, whereunto the proud, and such as embrace vanity, shall neuer come.
               And such as now pursue me, either with hate or reproach, shall sée in the end, that there is helpe only in thée, and that no arme of flesh can preuaile against thée, O God, nor against them that trust in thée.
               They shall say, when they sée the issue of my hope to be good, and that my prosperity is renewed, Loe, wee thought this man mad, wee deemed him a cast away: but loe, the Lord, in whom hee trusted, hath made him to stand, and his hand hath brought to passe what hee desired.
               
               And I my selfe shall then consider that I erred, when rashly I said, I was vtterly cast downe; for though when I cryed, thou séemedst not to

heare; when I sought thée, thou séemedst to hide thée from me: and when I complained vnto thée, thou diddest not regard it: I shell then confesse, that thy wisdome in humbling me, thy mercy in sustaining me, and thy prouidence in relieuing me, doth passe the capacity of the wisest men.
               Therefore (deare Father) I will yet wait that acceptable time, I will yet attend thy good pleasure and will, and will not indent with thée when, nor direct thée the manner how thou shouldest helpe me: but submitting my selfe vnto thée, I will hold my peace, though men say yet of me, There is no helpe for me in thee.
               
               O Lord increase my Faith.
            
            
               
               The Motiue to the sixt Prayer.
               
               
                  THe poore Man finding the troubles of this life grieuous vnto him still, begins his Prayer with a Meditation, wherein hee desireth to leaue the Earth, and earthly things, and to be with God, where all good things are; flying to God with serious lamentations, for that God absenteth himselfe, and keepeth backe his comforts, notwithstanding his long crying vnto him. And therefore heartily prayeth, that God will heare him, and helpe him now in the deepest of his troubles: being become ignominious to the World, by reason of his miseries, in somuch as hee is ashamed to be seene of men, and withall seemeth to be rapt vp with the contemplation of heauen and heauenly things. And standing thus ballanced betweene griefe of his crosses, and ioy of his comfort to come, he resolueth himselfe to endure for the time, and referreth the end and managing of his course to God alone, to whom hee prayeth, that hee will so much fauour him,

as that hee may receiue such inward consolation, and outward comfort, as he may haue cause to beginne his praise of God here, for his deliuery promising as it were in himselfe, that hee will glory in nothing in this life (howsoeuer hee be aduanced) but in God onely. But fearing lest hee should be depriued of the occasion of praising God, for his helpe extended, he instantly beseecheth God, that as he is beaten downe by his corrections, so he may be raised againe by his mercy and prouidence.
            
            
               The sixt Prayer, to learne how to leaue the world and worldly things, and to desire heauen and heauenly things.

               For I am weary of my groaning, I faint vnder the most cruell burthen of

               Be not farre away from me, and put me not altogether to confusion: let me not vtterly perish, while there is none to helpe: I am ignominious in the sight of all men, by reason of my miseries, & miserable, by reason of my sins: I am a reproch vnto my neighbours, and many iest and laugh at my fall.
               Insomuch as I am ashamed to be seene of men, and wish I were able to flye out of the earth, and that I might

once be, where I might with ioy behold thée in thy triumphant Throne, where is neither hunger, nor thirst, nor nakednesse, nor want, nor ignominy, nor sinne, nor death; but all fulnesse, and glory, and truth, and ioy, and life eternall.
               O swéet being with thée! most happy dwelling and abiding with thée.
               But loe, Lord, this place so glorious, these ioyes so swéet, and these comforts so sure, are not attained vnto, but with vnfauoury affliction in this life. This future happy, and immortall life, cannot be without the death and suffering of this mortall body.
               And therefore, Father eternall, be it vnto me in this fraile life, euen as thou wilt, that I may possesse thée, and the ioyes with thée, of eternall life.
               Afford mée thy fauour: let mee inioy thy blessings, euen here in this life, that I may here beginne to ioy in thee, and here beginne to praise thée among the children of men, that they may sée and consider, that though great are the troubles, and miseries, and afflictions, which the Righteous suffer here, thou yet deliuerest them out of all. So shall

               Awake therefore in time (O Lord) awake, preserue me, that I perish not in these miseries, and lest I being as one forgotten and forsaken of thée, be censured a cast-away among such as sée me: and so being depriued of the occasion of praising thée for my deliuery, I be driuen from one sorrow to another, and all my hope turned into distrust of any recouery. Hide not thou therefore thy face, forget not my miseries, and be not carelesse of mine afflictions for euer.
               My soule is beaten downe euen to the dust; my heart fainteth, my hands become weake, my knées waxe féeble, mine eyes are dimme, and all the parts of my body are vexed, and I goe continually

mourning in my miseries.
               O sée & regard my miserable plight, looke vpon my griefes, and ease the intollerable burthens of my calamities: for though thou hast made a great woūd by thy corrections, yet, O Lord, thou canst cure it againe with spiritual comfort, & not with-hold the outward good things, ordained for the comfort of thy Children in this life.
               Turne thy face vnto mee, which I instantly seeke; send downe thine aide, which I heartily craue, and haue mercy vpon mee, for I am most desolate and poore.
               Rise vp, O Lord, rise vp, thou that art louing and bountifull: let me rise vp againe by thee, that am throwne downe by thee; and though my sinnes (as a sword) haue cut me from thy fauour, let the righteousnesse of thy beloued vnite me vnto thee againe, in such sort, as nothing may separate me from thee for euer.

                  THE poore Man being lately in an extreame agonie, neere vnto despaire, by reason of his sinnes and miseries, he here begins to rowze himselfe vp againe, sodainely crying out, that the Lord is yet his hope, and therefore promiseth to hold fast by him, and not to giue ouer for euer: no, whatsoeuer troubles doe befall him, and miseries assaile him: yea, howsoeuer the world and worldly things be moued against him, he armeth himselfe with faith in God, to stand with patience in all. Nay, such is his assurance of a more blessed being, after this little time of tryall, that hee affirmeth these crosses that happen here, to be but trifles, and of no weight to be borne, in respect of the future happinesse: yet because hee will not

seeme senselesse of Gods corrections, and be idle in well doing, hee still solliciteth the Lord for some tokens of his loue here; namely, that hee will binde vp his sores, and heale his wounds with his holy helpe, and that he will renue him with spirituall vnderstanding, and cleanse his affections, that he may thinke, speake, and doe all to the glory of his name, and that his tongue may be an instrument to praise him before the children of men, for his deliuery, promising to continue constant till the time appointed.

confesse and acknowledge, that thou art my God, and therefore thou wilt not suffer me to be vtterly lost, or perish altogether.
               No, Lord, though the earth be moued, and though the mountaines be tumbled into the middest of the Sea, though the waters roare and swell, and the loftie hils tremble at the furie thereof: yet will I not be discouraged, because I haue thée my Saluation.
               Should I then faint at the small afflictions, which as little darts, thou shootest at me in loue, not to kill mee, but to put me in minde of my vanitie and forgetfulnesse of thée, to call mee from mine errours of the truth, from sinne to saluation, and from death to eternall life? I must confesse against my selfe, that I haue deserued the darts of eternall death, and to be shut out of the land of the liuing: but mitigate thine anger, and turne thy heauy displeasure into loue and liuely reliefe, and let me once taste, and be refreshed with that comforting riuer, that maketh glad thy distressed Children.
               O God of hoasts, come and behold

my desolation, and cause those thy deadly darts, which so fast stick on me, by little and little to fal away, and cure the wounds which thou hast made.
               Binde vp the sores of my sorrowfull soule, clense the corrupted affections of my defiled heart, lighten the dim eyes of my darke vnderstanding, wash me throughly from mine iniquities, and purifie me from sinne.
               Make me to heare ioy and gladnesse againe after my long mourning, giue me reliefe againe after my long want, set me vpon a sure rocke, and plant me on a fruitfull ground, among the flourishing trées, that prosper by the swéet waters of thy liuely fauour.
               Oh cast me not away, deare Father, cast me not away from thy presence, restore me rather to the glory of thy saluation, and establish me with thy frée Spirit.
               Lord, open my mouth, that my tongue may be an instrument to praise thée for thy liberall reliefe, and ready helpe in my néede and necessity.
               So when thou shalt renue my decaied store, and replenish my empty basket, when thou shalt yéelde comfort to my sad soule, and refresh my sorrowfull

heart, I will surely vtter foorth thy praise with vnfained lips, I will giue glory vnto thy name, and publish thy mercy to all the world.
               Oh 
                     •
                  e therefore vnto me a spéedy helper, delay not too long to come, my saluation: for behold, I am in a miserable case, as thou well knowest, poore, as thou séest.
               Reiect not yet my petition, who cry instantly to thée for helpe, O helpe before I perish vtterly, hold mée fast by thy hand, and lift me vp againe before I fall altogether.
               Thou hast not promised, I know, that which thou wilt not performe, and therefore I will waite faithfully, for the time is at hand that thou hast ordained for my deliuery. And therefore by the priuiledge of a liuely hope, which will neuer make them ashamed that fixe it on thée, I will perseuere: confirme my hope, and make it perfect, vntill I may inioy the liuely fruits of thine assured saluation.
               O Lord increase my Faith.
            
            
               
               The Motiue to the eight Prayer.
               
               
                  In which the poore distressed man craueth pardon for his sinnes, the cause of his miseries.
               
                  THe poore man, as it were ouer-charged with the burthen of his miseries, wisheth himselfe wings to flie away from all occasions of calamities, but forthwith checketh his rashnesse & folly, in seeming desirous to hide him from God, that is euery where, and can euery where punish the transgressours of his will. And therefore prayeth, that God will bridle his affections, and giue him patience, appealing vnto the Almighty, who knoweth his desires to doe well, though the peruersenesse of his nature doe draw him into things offensiue: and therefore disclaiming his owne worthinesse, craueth pardon and mercy, acknowledging the generall weaknesse of all mankinde, and his owne to be the greatest of all; and therefore prayeth

for strength, for wisdome and instruction, affirming him to be most happy indeede, whom he fauoureth, by reason of the infinite blessings that he euen here enioyeth in this mortall life: although hee withall cryeth out against the miseries that doe still oppresse him, keeping fast hold through hope, that yet God will not suffer him to perish, nor fall vtterly, because he is a rock whereon the righteous, such as doe take hold of the death and passion of Christ, doe rest most safe from al dangers: and therefore concludeth his Prayer with an instant Petition, that God wil giue him a blessed end of his hope, that he may talke of his glory, and sing of his praise, that all men may see by his example, that God respecteth the cause of the needy.
            
            
               The eight Prayer in distresse.
               OH that I had winge like a Doue then would I flye away from these troubles, and make mine abode in the wildernes among the thick bushes and branches of the Cedars, rather then to endure these intollerable miseries among the sonnes of men.
               
                  
But alas, Lord, what doe I consult thus with the vaine wisedome of flesh and bloud? thou art God, and were I in the Wildernesse, thou art there; were I in the vttermost parts of the earth, thou art there: were I on the highest mountaines, or in the bowels of the Earth, or in the Sea, or in the clouds, thou art there, and canst there also finde me out, and there visite mine iniquities with stripes, and my sinnes with scourges.
               It booteth mée not to couet to hide me from thée: better is it for mee to subiect mée vnto thy will. And therefore bridle mine affections, tame the vnrulinesse and fiercenesse of my heart, reforme the words of my mouth, teach me right wisedome, and learne me true vnderstanding: vouchsafe me perfect patience, and then shall I be néerest vnto that liberty which I long for, and best fréed from the dangers which I feare, and soonest enioy the comforts that I desire.
               O make no long tarrying, O Lord, but hasten my deliuerance: preserue me from the furious stormes & raging tempests that are yet ready to giue my wearied Soule a new encounter.
               
                  
Wherefore hast thou left vnto vs (by thy Word) a commandement to cast our cares vpon thée, and tolay our burdens vpon thée, promising to comfort vs and to ease vs? It is not to deceiue, but to deliuer vs.
               Thou séest my desires, and knowest the secrets of my heart, and all 
                     〈◊〉
                   wayes are manifest before thée. If therefore I should iustifie my selfe, thou wilt condemne mee: if I hide my sinnes, thou findest out my corruptions, and that all my righteousnesse is worse then vanity it selfe.
               And therefore disclayming mine integrity, I craue pardon; and aske mercy, wherein thou art rich, and whereof thou art most bountifull, euen to such as acknowledge their owne weakenesse, wants and wickednesse.
               To thy mercy I appeale, I flie vnto thée, I depend on thée, I lay my burden vpon thée, fearing thée, and reuerencing thée, louing thée, and trusting in thée.
               What imperfections, O Lord, séest thou in mée, for which thou shouldest thus afflict me? O wretch that I am, amost wicked one, a corrupted one,

defiled within and without, how can I plead any good duties done vnto thée?
               But, good Father, thou art not ignorant of the generall vanity of man, who is euill in his best wayes, and the most pure of vs is imperfect. Pardon then my weakenesse, and giue mée that strength, and that zeale, and that obedience, and that perfect loue, that thou requirest.
               Be vnto me a Father to instruct me in true wisedome; be vnto me a guide, to leade mée in that way that leadeth vnto life, that after my long estraying from thée, I may be at last brought home to thy blessed fauour againe, wherein is life, and liberty, and comfort, and fulnesse, and ioy, and rest, and peace for euer.
               Oh happy is he, that is in thy protection, most happy is hee whom thou fauourest: for he is wise, he is strong, he is godly, he is fed, he is clad, hée is safe, and hee is rich in euery good thing.
               When he calleth, thou hearest, when hee asketh, thou giuest; when hée séeketh, hée findeth; when hée is sicke, thou curest him; when hée is poore, thou prouidest for him, when he is sad,

thou comfortest him; when he is weary, thou easest him: when he hungreth, thou féedest him: when he is in trouble, thou defendest him: when he is in danger, thou preseruest him: when he is hated, thou louest him: and when he is dead, he then entereth into that life which is eternall, and then partaketh of the ioyes which are vnspeakable.
               Oh, accept mée into this fauour, wherein are so many blessings certaine: furnish me with these blessings, wherein are so swéete contentations, and bestow on mee those graces that make the most despised in the world most honourable with thée. So shall my sorrowes be turned into ioy, my want into sufficiency, my teares into gladnesse, and all my miseries into godly mirth.
               Deliuer my soule from death, kéepe my féete from sliding, let mée walke righteously before thée, and call instantly vpon thée, who performest thy promises, and sufferest none to depart empty away, that séeke thée with their whole hearts.
               Oh send therefore, and saue mee from them that would deuoure mee, and from that which afflicteth me; for

my soule is among Lyons; I wade as through a raging sea: I dwell among men set on fire against me, whose teeth are speares, and whose tongues are as a two edged sword: let thy mercy therfore and truth be my shield & buckler.
               Thou hast euer béen mine hope, helpe me therefore, and let not my troubles increase, renew my ioyes, and set mée vpon the rock of neuer-failing reliefe, and let my rest and refuge be for euer vnder the shadow of thy protection.
               Bring to passe what is fit for me, and which thou knowest expedient; let the righteous sée the blessed end of my hope, that they may likewise talke of thy glory, and speake of thy praise.
               And all men shall say, Verily, there is fruit for the righteous: doubtlesse, there is a God that worketh good for them that are of a perfect heart.
               
               O Lord increase my Faith.
            
            
               
               The Motiue to the ninth Prayer, for assurance of Gods Prouidence.
               
               
                  THe poore man, notwithstanding his present heauy burthen of affliction, hath and feeleth in himselfe an inward instinct of comfort, and in meere zeale of Gods glory, breaketh out into an admiration, as it were, of his infinite Maiestie, power and excellency, and consequently, recounteth the innumerable blessings, and infinite mercies of the Lord: who, so regardeth the frailty of man, as hee seemeth to winke at his many euils, confessing it the meere kindnesse, and free fauour of God, that all mankinde is not confounded for disobedience; laying vpon himselfe the guilt of his own sinnes, for which, beyond all other, the Lord may iustly punish him; acknowledging that hee more offendeth God by his sins, then he can appease him with his Prayers, and doth more moue him to anger by his transgressions, then hee can please him by his best zeale:

And yet he longeth still to be at one with God, in whom he knoweth there is mercy and loue, and liberty, and reliefe: In hope whereof, and that God will remember his louing kindnesse againe towards him, hee will yet trust and pray, and be patient. And yet seeing his corruptions still strong to beat down his faith in God, prayeth God to bridle his vngodly affections, lest hee feare ouer-much, and so faint and giue ouer his suite; and desireth by the examples of Ioh, Ioseph and Dauid, and other godly Fathers, that endured their troubles patiently, he may likewise be patient vnto the end. And thus rowzing vp his dead thoughts, and sorrowfull soule, with the sweet consideration of infinite comforts (which his louing God hath euer, and doth daily bestow vpon his poore oppressed children) he resolueth not to faint.
            
            
               
               The ninth Prayer, in which the poore distressed Man acknowledgeth, that though God doe deseruedly punish him, yet he assureth himselfe that God will relieue him.
               O Lord my God, thy name is most excellent in all the World, thy glory is spread abroad thorow the Heauens, and thy praise is vttered by all thy Creatures, as in an vniuersall harmony, thorow Heauen and Earth.
               For thy mercies are infinite, and thy blessings without number, that thou hast best owed vpon them all, especially vpon the Children of men, who yet among all other Creatures, are most forgetfull, and aptest to breake out into strongest disobedience against thy Maiestie: and of thy free fauour and mercy it is, that all Adams issue is not vtterly rooted out of the Land of the liuing.
               And I for my part (Father most louing) cannot hold my selfe guiltlesse

of infinite euils, whereby I haue yéelded greatest cause among many, that thou shouldest punish euen the whole World for disobedience: but my selfe especially I confesse worthy of my miseries, and not to deserue the vse of the Aire to breathe in, nor of any of thy creatures to be comforted by them.
               Worthily therefore hast thou afflicted me, and worthily maist thou stil visite me: for I sée I doe rather more incense thée by my sins, then appea
                     •
                  e thée by my prayers; I more offend th
                     •
                  e by transgressions, then I can please thée by my best zeale.
               I faint at mine owne vnworthines, yet faine would I be at one with thée, in whom is onely safety and succour, and assured saluation, to them that truly reforme their liues, & rightly frame their repentance, and sincerely follow thy will, which is thine owne gift.
               All this I desire to performe, and distrust thée not: for thou hast promised pardon to the penitent, and reliefe to the lowly, and to be with them that séeke thée, and to hold them vp that hold by thée, and to instruct them that séeke wisedome of thée.
               
                  
Forasmuch therefore, as I haue so long cryed vnto thée, & so long sought thée, I will yet hope, though I shut vp my sad soule in si
                     •
                  ence, onely vnto thée, who wel cōsiderest the inward gro
                     •
                  es, and rightly ponderest the sorrowes, and sighes, and wants, and desires of thy distressed Children, though they séeme mute in their lips, and to speake nothing with their tongues.
               If thou mightest at all haue béene pleased to heare by earnest cryes, thou mightst haue heard me: if it might haue pleased thée to succour mée by earnest desires, I might haue béene relieued. But lo
                     •
                  , the time is not yet come, that thou hast appointed for my deliuery, and therefore I will still wait, and not be weary; for my helpe, and my comfort, and my life, and my saluation dependeth on thée.
               O brible therefore all vngodly affections in me: let me neither murmure, nor grudge, nor feare, nor faint, but with patience (in well doing) tarry till thou haue decréed to haue mercy vpon mée.
               For, is there not an appointed time for all things▪ 
                  Iob was brought low by thée: yet at thine appointed time

lifted vp againe. Ioseph was long afflicted in prison; yet when thou sawest the time, he was aduanced againe. Thy deare Dauid was long and fiercely persecuted, yet at length established in his desired dignitie.
               When the poore 
                     •
                  iddow was euen at the end of her hope of further reliefe, her cruze of Oyle being emptied, and her vessell of Meale spent, euen then diddest thou send her a relieuing guest, by whom thou gauest her increase of necessary succour.
               Therefore yet a little while, and my appointed time will come, wherein I shall be also deliuered out of all my miseries.
               Yea, thou art my strength, and my portion, and my defence, and my saluation: thou 
                     •
                  éest my miseries what they are, and how many they be, and how heauy they lye vpon me: for thou that sendest them, art not ignorant of them; and thou that madest mee, well knowest what is fittest to preserue mee.
               I am brought to the very Pit of confusion, as the naturall man déemeth; but thou hast decréed the time of my deliuery, to mée unknowne, that

when it commeth, I may reioyce in thee, and not attribute my recouery to the fleshly aide of mortall men, which I haue sought in vaine; yea, while I ca

               O, blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to come vnto thée by afflictions: for although he séemeth to be a companion of Death, yet he liueth by the secret swéetnes of the pleasures of thy inward consolation, and safely dwelleth in the Courts of thy protection, f

                  est on earth.
               So am I assured, O Lord, that thou art my portion, and thou tendrest mée as a sonne, though thou visit me with thy Rod, as a sinner: and that thou wilt not suffer mee to fall vtterly, though thou séeme to correct mee sharpely.
               Although I séeme to be depriued of all hope of recouery of my wonted

comfort, because I sée no ready meane before my eyes, nor present likelihood: notwithstanding my long and instant cryes, I will not shrinke, knowing this, that thy loue is infinite, thy power wonderfull, and thy prouidence past finding out.
               For if the stony Rocke, and the withered Jow-bone; could yéeld water to refresh the thirsty: if thou couldest send Manna from heauen, and meate by a

                  en, and féede so many thousand people with little shew of bread: if thou couldest send Quailes so plentifully in the Desert, with infinite other things, miraculously for thy distressed Children: confirme my Faith euermore, that I may constantly beléeue, that thou both canst, and will in thy good time relieue mée.
               All power belongeth vnto thée: who then will say, or who can imagine that thou canst not helpe when most néede is? who will say thou hast not loue, sith thou so fréely hast done these many and mighty things for thy distressed Children, that could not relieue themselues?
               But loe (Lord) all things are thine,

the Heauens are thine, and the Earth is thine, the Cattle in the fields, the Fowles on the Mountaines, the Gold and Siluer, and all that is aboue vs or beneath vs, is thine: who then can say, thou canst not giue and bestow on whom thou wilt, what thou wist, when thou wilt?
               Thou makest the Corne to grow, and waterest the Earth with thy swéet showers from aboue, so that euen the Beasts also of the field are fed, as by the dew of Heauen.
               Sith then that thou art Lord of all, and sith thou commandest and forbiddest, sith thou makest poore and enrichest, sith thou throwest downe and aduancest, sith thou triest and rewardest, and sith thou doest what thou wilt, in what manner thou wilt, to whom thou wilt, and when thou wilt, and no man can command thée or forbid thée; I yéeld me wholly to thy will, and craue onely to will as thou willest, and doe as thou directest in all things. Be it thus, deare Father, for his merits that thou most dearely louest, that died, and rose againe for all, and who sitteth with thée, a Mediator for all: for his sake, O Father, heare

and helpe mee in time conuenient.
               Amen.

               A Motiue to thankefulnesse to GOD, for Comfort and Reliefe receiued of him, after long praying vnto him in the time of necessity and affliction.
               
               
                  PSAL. 28. 7.
                  The Lord is my strength and my shield, my heart trusteth in him, and I was holpen therefore my heart shall reioyce, and with my tongue will I praise him.
               
               
                  AS no man knoweth how profitable a thing physicke is, but he that hath béene sicke, and hath béene eased by it, nor of what value faithfull friends are, but hée that hath béene brought to extreme néede, and tasted of

their help: so none can sufficiently comprehend, how great the goodnes of God is, but such as haue béene tried by some affliction, and felt grieuous calamity, and haue béene deliuered by God, out of their dangers, and miseries, or in some measure béene eased. And if hée that in sicknesse hath receiued health by physick: if he that in his great necessity and want hath bin relieued by friends, doe not acknowledge the benefit receiued by either of them, will not all men of ciuill carriage condemne them of ingratitude? So, and far more, worthy is he to be condemned, that being afflicted by whatsoeuer meanes, and is deliuered by the prouidence and fauour of God, if he stand silent and mute, not endeauouring to giue God the praise and glory of his deliuery. This I confesse is my case, and no doubt there is no man exempted out of the number of them, whom God hath deliuered out of one danger, and affliction, or another: But some being blinde of that side, sée no other meanes of their deliuery, but their selfe-wit, policie, strength, or carnall meanes, neuer turning eye to the true helpe, the power and prouidence of God: and that is the

cause why (as there were of ten Lepers, but one returned to giue thankes to Christ) so few, scarcely one of ten that receiue blessings and comforts at the hands of God, returne thankes truely to God for the same, and yet there is not one of what estate, degrée, or profession he be of, but must (if he be not an Atheist) acknowledge himselfe a debter vnto God in this behalfe, who requireth but onely thankfulnesse for al his benefits. Some may say, they were neuer afflicted, neuer oppressed, neuer distressed, neuer in danger, for they haue had continual prosperity, and therefore could neuer obserue, wherein God hath shewed them any such néedfull deliuerance: some are borne noble, some left rich, many preferred to Offices, and that immediately of their Parents, Friends, or themselues, neuer conceiuing that the hand of God had a share in these. And therefore (it to any) they giue the glory to the wrong meanes, forgetting their Creator, by whom they were made, preserued, and by whom they were (indéede) preferred to place of dignity or profit, by whom they were taught and instructed in the mysteries, whereby they become glorious

in the 
                     •…
                  orld, and so become gracelesse vsurpers of Gods gracious and frée blessings: in recompence whereof it is often obserued, that God (as it were) winking at their vanities for a time, permitteth them to runne their owne race, vntill they fall into some apparant dangers: as some into want, some into disgrace, some into sicknesse, some into the hands of Enemies, some into grosse fatuity and foolishnes. In all which they run vnto their former vaine considerations, séeking redresse by wrong meanes, and finding none, they then consult with some better guide, who set them in the way to séeke God, who being mercifull, refuseth not to be their refuge that come vnto him, at length, by faith in prayer, who yet will séeme not to heare them by and by, when they speake vnto him, nor to giue what, and when they aske, to make them the more earnest and seruent in asking, and finding at the length Gods fauour, and receiuing in some measure what they want, then the vpright in heart (as Dauid saith,) become thankefull, hauing gotten comfort from the Lord, they willingly giue him the glory: the true Children

of God cānot rest contented, when God hath refreshed them with his mercies, till they haue truly giuen the Lord againe his due praises: a marke to distinguish the Children of God from the wicked, who swallow vp all Gods blessings, namely the profitable and pleasing things of this life, ascribing the glory, and doing their Sacrifices (as it were) vnto their owne armes for the same: what blessings soeuer God doth bestow vpon them, they are neuer the fuller of thankefulnesse, nor made thereby the more obedient to God, like the Lake Asphaltis or the dead Sea, whereinto Iordan runneth, the water of it selfe being salt, becomes nothing the fresher by the swéetenesse of the qualitie, nor the bigger by the quantitie of the water of Iordan; they take from the Lord without giuing againe, like barren and vnprofitable ground, that receiueth the séede, but returneth none, and therefore is neere vnto burning (as the Prophet Hosea saith) whose end is to be burned. Let vs therefore learne to be thankefull to God for euery benefit receiued of God, which if it increaseth not thankfulnes, it increaseth iudgement. It is a dangerous

thing to forget God, in thanksgiuing, neglecting heauen, and heauenly things, and to minde the world onely and worldly things, they that preach vnto themselues peace, without peace with God, in what outward state of contentment soeuer they stand in their owne conceits, and in the view and admiration of men, they be but in slippery state, though they séeme to haue no occasion to flye vnto God for succour; they are in déeper danger then he, whose estate without séemeth most dangerous, who yet within hath an assurance of the helpe of Iehouah. Such as to whom Christ spake, Ioh. 16. Verily, verily, I say vnto you, ye sh

                     ll weep and lament, but the world (such as haue all things in the world at their desires) shall reioyce, and ye shall sorrow, but your sorrow shall be turned into ioy.
               
               You shall be deliuered from all your dangers wherein you shall reioyce, and glorifie God for your deliuerance, whereas this sentence being turned contrary, may be applied vnto such as forgetting their duties and thankfulnesse to God, because they are full, and thinke they haue no néede of Gods assistance; Verily, verily, I say vnto you,
                  
yee shall reioyce and triumph, but the godly shall lament and mourne, ye shall laugh, but your laughter shall be turned into weeping.
               But I will leaue the ingratefull Worldlings, whom not I, but God will iudge, and will onely séeks to stir vp my selfe and others that are afflicted to flye vnto God, as I haue done, assuring them in the good time they shall be comforted. And let patience haue it true worke in you that are in any aifliction, and let true thankefulnesse appeare in you, that haue béene any way comforted by the Lord. Patience and Thankfulnes are qualities, or rather vertues, obserued onely in the Children of God, yet are they not in these accounted fooles or mad men? for if a man that feareth God fall into penury, pouerty, want, or into any kind of misery, or is ouer-taken with any strong temptation, or tryed by Gods visitation, hee is censured according to the naturall and caruall opinions of the worldly minded; who as they are blinde in heauenly things, as in the secret disposition of the things of God, so iudge they amisse of the man afflicted, holding him as a

man accursed of God, because he is chastened of God: and themselues, whose matters prosper wel in the world, to be only blessed as by desert: and this bréedeth such coniempt of the rich towards the poore fearing God, and this vsurpeth such reuerence of the poore towards the rich, both which especially procéede of an ouer-good opinion that the rich haue of themselues, & of a base conceit they haue of such as are of law estate, though they be the dearest children of God: which in the rich is arrogancy, and in the poore fearing God, humility: yet it often commeth to passe, that the rich are made poore, the high are

               The first cannot pretend iniustice or wrong in God, for taking away from him that which he falsely suggested to be his, in such sort, as he was not beholden to God for it: neither can the other (nor will hee) assume vnto himselfe merit to haue that bestowed vpon him by desert, which he cannot but acknowledge, and thankfully accept to be the frée gift of God: as God is

                  ust, so is he mercifull, and euen in this case of his iustice hée sheweth mercy, to the end men may séeke and finde mercy: and in this case of his prouidence hée confirmeth his mercy, and performeth his promise: the one to moue to thankefulnesse, the other to increase and continue it: hée interrupteth the haughty and high-minded in the way of their pride, fatherly to reclaime them from the way of death, the end of Gods corrections. The godliest men are many times, and by many meanes likewise plunged in dangers, but they féele in their sharpest afflictions swéetest comforts: for though they féele the

rod of Gods correcting hand, yet they hold fast by the staffe of his mercy, praying vnto God for deliuery, not as they will, but as the Lord will: not for their owne priuate benefit onely, but also, and especially, that his glory and power, by their deliuerance, might be the more celebrated of all that feare him: for there is not a more forcible inducement of imitation then successe: when men sée the issue of another mans course, they will in discretion follow or forsake, as is the profit or danger, especially men of one profession, obserue time, and meane, and matter, and place, and person, of precedent good or euill: and by the same endeuour to frame and shape vnto themselues a course answerable for their owne priuate commodities, this is the manner of worldlings: and shall not the children of God make vse of other mens most blessed successe, of faithfull prayer for deliuery out of their miseries▪ who being in danger, séeing before his eyes the manner how another in like perill was deliuered, and will not séeke the same way to be relieued? It is the nature of true godlinesse to publish euery benefit receiued at the hands of God,

as Dauid in many places by his owne example, and many other holy men haue done: and left their examples for vs to follow, to the end that all, were it possible, might be partakers of the knowledge of Gods prouidence & loue towards all that séeke him with a true zeale, contrary to the course of worldly men, who couet to conceale the meanes whereby they atchieue commodities, not willing that any should partake of their gaine. The man of God hauing that celestiall Jewel in what measure soeuer, willingly and fréely maketh all others that are desirous, partakers of it, that all may grow likewise rich in the same faith, knowledge, and vertue with him; the godly much reioyce in him that most excelleth in diuine vertues, notdisdaining any for his pouerty or basenes of his worldly estate, but imbracing the pouerty of the body, & the estate of outward wants, in regard of the inward riches of the minde: for as hee that séemeth rich in outward things, may be indéede a banckerupt; so hee that is poore in carnall things, may be rich in heauenly: else were the miserable poore man more wretched then any creature, that walketh or

créepeth vpon the earth, flyeth in the ayre, or that floateth in the waters: of whom all haue a contented being; but the poore oppressed man hath no comfort at all, if he be not inwardly comforted of God: in whom if he be truly comforted, his comfort is beyond all that the world can afford.
               The worldly farmer, the rich Marchant, the gallant Gentleman, the honorable person, and the greatest Monarch without the same, hath no true comfort, but earthly and vanishing shaddows of things without true comfort or continuance: yet is not this so taken, nor so accounted; for the glorious hauing onely terrene reuerence, receiue their glory from the basest: but the poore despised, hauing confidence in God, haue their glory from aboue: whereunto no earthly honor can compare. This then may worke in them patience to beare the burthen of misery, here for a while, and for euery small benefit or blessing which God shall bestow vpon them to be truly thankfull, and yet not to deiect themselues, and be so carelesse of their estates, as to neglect all lawfull meanes of worldly prosperity, because pouerty, affliction,

and persecution in the godly, séeme to be a glorious title, bearing as it were, the Crosse of Christ thereby. But so farre to endeuour to atchieue necessary ability and outward peace, as that ambition may be farre from the thought in desiring; and auarice in vsing, or repineth against what God sendeth. And to be carefull, diligent, and faithfull in the execution of their callings, praying for a blessing at the hands of God: and if endeuors prosper, alwaies to returne for all things praises vnto God, that maketh all things prosper vnto vs: and if the industry of our bodies, and the continuall care of our hearts cannot attaine to that which we thinke fit, wée must rest contented with the portion allotted by him vnto vs, who knoweth better what is fit for vs, then wée our selues, and yet neuer to giue ouer praying vnto the great giuer, who will neuer faile to adde more and more comfort, as hée séeth most iust occasion, best knowne to himselfe, & can turne all our crosses and deepest afflictions to our greatest consolation, when the best and most pleasing earthly delights tend to the euill of such as haue them, and either

abuse them, or be not thankefull for them. Such as are ignorant of the discipline which God vseth to instruct and educate his children, can conceiue of no comfort in crosses, berause as they are strangers from the Schoole of God, so learne they not the things belonging to such as are Gods di

                  ciples: but condemne what is to be approued, and approue what is to be condemned; holding no man happy, but he that prospereth in his wayes, and he to whom all things succéede according to his hearts desire, when indéede nothing is more dangerous, then fulnesse of all things, which bréedeth security, and security killeth all other vertues, and reuiueth all vices: carnall security plucketh vp faith (as it were) by the rootes, Faith being the trée of all vertues, it dying, Neglect of God, and all goodnesse, beginnes to branch, and beares Forgetfulnesse of duty to God and men. Where then is thankefulnesse? Where is giuing Glory to God? Where is prayer and séeking to God for blessings, when hée findeth no cause to aske, for what he supposeth he inioyeth? blessing himselfe in his own wretched estate, which he foolishly

déemeth a most warthy and incomparable portion. But he that is godly, abandoneth all carnall security, acknowledging himselfe euer in so great danger, as when hée carnally thinkes himselfe most safe, and therefore taketh continuall occasion to flye vnto God for daily supply of daily wants, hauing no assurance of the continuance of any earthly thing, but from day to day: and therefore daily and hourely acknowledgeth the goodnesse of God, in giuing him what hee daily enioyeth. He forgetteth not that all things that hée hath, he hath from God, his creation, his life, the vse of all his limbes, his senses, his foode, his raiment, his health, his ablenesse to performe the least duty in his calling, and whatsoeuer else, inward or outward, hée holdeth them at the will of the Almighty, to whom he prayeth for all graces and diuine vertues, that he may be furnished with that riches that none can possesse, but such as haue them from that great God, who giueth to them that aske, and vpbraideth no man, neither denyeth he any mans request, if it be according to his will reuealed in his word: and for all that

he giueth, requireth onely true thankfulnesse for requitall: not that thankfulnesse, which some carnally minded rich men would séeme to afford him, a cap vailed with both the hands, with words onely, I thanke God: This may be counterfeit and lip-thankefulnesse, which God respecteth as the offring of hypocrites. The organs of the tongue & lips are necessary instruments to declare the meaning of the heart, if they moue by the power of a féeling spirit: but if the mouth speake in these diuine offices what the heart inforceth not, it shall not onely not profit, but witnes against the heart & conscience that déepe dissimulation before men, & hypocrisie before God, that shall worke their own iust condemnation. But wée must fall downe vpon the knées, not onely of the outward body, but of a liuely féeling heart, & acknowledge that all we haue receiued, to be his blessing and especial gift: which if we can rightly performe, it will follow, that of the same faith wil procéede with words of thankfulnesse, workes of obedience, which God accepteth aboue all sacrifices whatsoeuer. But who so still asketh and receiueth blessings, and onely saith, They

are the gifts of God, and disposeth of them contrary to the rule which God hath prescribed in his Word, that thankfulnes will returne into his bosome as sin, and he be imputed a plaine vsurper of his blessings. For, as when a man by faire and flattering meanes obtaineth any thing of his friends, and hauing obtained it, reiecteth the kindnesse of the giuer, and becommeth ingratefull and vnkinde, what is it but méere extorting of the thing obtained? Although the all-séeing eye of God fore-séeth the heart, and knoweth how and to what end wée aske, whether for our owne gaine, or his glory: and hée often bestoweth great benefits vpon men, neuer desiring them in open spéech. The very groanes of the heart ascend vnto God, and God is moued euen with the méere desires, and that oftentimes when they procéede not of faith; yea, hée granteth the very things that the wicked long for, but not for their comfort, onely to fulfill their carnall appetites, to make them so much the more beholden to him, for their worldly and corporall prosperity, and makes their condemnation so much the more iust, by how

much they are inexcusable, for not seruing God in true obedience, which is the summe of most acceptable thankefulnesse for all blessings. It is the nature of al men, to couet earthly things, which wée sée God giueth to the euill as well, and in greater measure then to the godly: yet are the godly farre more thankfull for their smallest, then the wicked for their greatest portions; which last doe hunger and thirst continually to adde more and more corporall meanes vnto what they haue: and no abundance can make a stay to their coueting, neither can there be satisfaction to the couetous. And howsoeuer it increase, all their thankfulnesse is swallowed vp in their Chests, or cast vpon their fields, giuen to their wits, to their Art, or drowned in their vanities, the backe and belly haue their condigne gratifications of the most, and they are most beholding to some, who rest as much indebted vnto these two, in answering their necessities, as vnto God, in a sort, to whom they owe many, and will neuer pay any thankes. And yet the prophanest of these will say, that all the things they inioy, are the gifts of God. But as for

the cordiall and true thankefulnesse, it is a language vnknowne vnto them. The blessings of God to many, may be compared to swéet showres, and our hearts to dry ground, receiuing them to refresh it when it is weary, but returning no drops backe againe: no more doe vnthankefull men returne condigne thankes for Gods greatest benefits, but as the Sun by his force and exhalations, draweth vp the moistures of the ingratefull earth by force, so when men can kéepe their vsurped and extorted earthly blessings no longer, then they bestow them, and yet oftentimes not at all consulting with the true owner, God the lender, but bestow them to some such ends as are displeasing vnto him, as was their former abusing them. They dispose of them by their wils, as it were against their wils: their Testaments are as testimonies of their vnwillingnesse to leaue what they so dearely loued, which proueth their grosse ingratitude, euen in their last conflict with death, who commonly is not so cruell an Enemy, but he telleth a man by one token or another, that he must prepare himselfe to endure his encounter, sometimes

many dayes, many moneths, and often many yéeres before hee shew his vttermost force: in all which time, the most forgetfull and most vnthankefull man might call himselfe to minde, and consult and consider wherefore, and by whom the things he enioyeth were bestowed vpon him: if by his owne deserts, or by his owne méere industry, let him then kisse his owne hand, as the author of his happinesse: but if it came of the frée gift and méere beneuolence of God, let him rather cut off his hands, then rest vnthankefull to God, who can turne (as we sée) wealth into wretchednesse, mirth into mourning, health into sicknesse, strength into weakenesse, and all whatsoeuer a man in this world delighteth in, into bitternesse and wormwood: all which may be assured to turne to their good, whosoeuer rest patient and thankfull. Who then will not affoord so small a recompence for so great blessings?
               And all thankefulnesse is comprehended vnder this one word Obedience. Sacrifices were acceptable duties done in their time vnto God, but obedience is more acceptable then all other kindes of sacrifices. This obedience

consisieth not in the outward ceremonies of performing onely the outward duties required at our hands, as to liue in this World without doing hurt to others, in paying that wée owe, in doing good to such as doe vs seruice, and to loue them that loue vs: but in doing good to them that doe vs hurt, in giuing them that take from vs, in forgiuing them that offend vs, in louing them that hate vs, in feeding them that wee sée hunger-starued, in cloathing them that we see want their corporall couering, in comforting the sad and

                  rowfull, in visiting such, both with counsell and aide, that haue not their wished liberty of Body or Minde, and in performing such other offices of Christian commiseration and piety, as are commanded vs in the Word of God, to be done towards our Brethren and Neighbours. These are outward workes, which being performed by a féeling heart, touched with the Spirit of God, are swéet sacrifices to God, and are accepted of God, as that true thankfulnesse, which God requireth in recompence of our abundance, which God so fréely and louingly bestoweth vpon vs aboue others in

this life: and for his spirituall gifts and blessings, as the blessing of the inward peace of conscience, the blessing of the knowledg
                     •
                   of his Word and Testimonies, the benefit of Faith, of Repentance, & of other diuine graces, hée onely requireth the true vse of them, as to loue him aboue all things, to liue in sobriety, temperance, in his feare, in the exercise of true religion, in prayer, in hearing his Word preached, in reading the same with reuerence, in continuall going forward from faith to faith, from one heauenly vertue to another, and in behauing our hearts inwardly, in such a liuely and willing remembrance, and execution of his diuine Will, as nothing may miscarry vs from what hée hath commanded, or draw vs into what hée hath forbidden.
               Thus if hée finde vs prepared, hée will then, as hee hath promised, blesse vs more and more, and giue and bestow vpon vs, more and more of his spirituall benefits, and adde vnto our stocke and store such abundance of all necessary outward things of this life, as wée shall not onely be able to féede, cloathe, maintaine, and relieue our

selues with wished contentment, but will giue such continuall increase, as we shall be able to performe these former duties to his néedy members, and there by not onely testifie to the World our Faith by our workes, who will glorifie God for vs: but God shall sée our faith in him, and approue our outward workes amongst men, to be good by our faith. These being the fruits of true obedience, and obedience the most acceptable sacrifice of thankfulnesse, a worke not onely not painefull or tedious, but most swéet vnto the soule, let vs unbrace it as the true wisedome, which, for the swéetenesse, passeth the hony and the hony-combe, and for preciousnesse and worth, of more value then the finest gold, or dearest earthly Jewels. Who will not then apply his heart vnto this most acceptable thankefulnesse, to which is promised a new and daily renuing of blessings, one blessing shall follow another, as the swéet drops of the morning dew: happy is the man that is in such a case. But most vnhappy the man forgetting God, and Gods benefits, nay, who offereth the sacrifice of praise in a false, or a cold, or counterfait manner,

as Cain did, who would be séene to giue vnto God part of his earthly abundance, but because it was done with no true affection, it was not accepted: no more are these vnworthy praises, which many worldlings séeme to flatter God withall, offering the Sacrifices not of idle, but of hatefull fooles, though in common spéech they can make semblance of great piety: As when they speake of Gods blessings, the increase of their Corne, Oile, and Wine, the prosperity of their Cattle, the long continuance of the health of their bodies, good successe in their affaires, they can vse an outward kinde of humiliation, bowing their counterfait knée, and

Had not the men of the old world great blessings at the hands of God? But where was their thankefulnesse? The earth was full of cruelty: a base recompence for so many blessings: yet did thinke themselues very secure: yea, when God in his secret Justice prepared their general confusion. Was God so strict in obseruing, & so seuere in punishing the whole world for vnthankefulnes, hauing but the Law of nature their guide? and will hée be lesse to a stiffe-necked people, or to one disobedient person, hauing the vse of his word▪ Is not mans vnthankfulnes towards man, censured in most euill part by man? how much more mans vnthankfulnesse to God? Laban found great benefit, and many blessings to grow vnto him in his earthly estate, by Iacobs faithfull and true seruice, yet how vnkindly did he reward him? Gen. 31. 2. Yet sée the mercies of the Lord, who séeing thankfull Iacobs afflicted heart,

that the Seruant that laboureth is worthy of his hire, I am (saith this caruall Logician) the Seruant of God, and therefore worthy of the gifts I receiue from him. Such hellish Syllogisms worldly men, the Schollers of perdition, can frame against themselues, not finding the subtilty of the Diuell in these Arguments, who striueth to colour by his Sophistry, this erronious conceit of theirs, in assuming desert to receiue good, where they deserue to receiue euill euermore.
               The Seruant of an earthly Master may performe in some measure his Masters worke, and may thereby deserue his promised hyre: but who so thus pretendeth himselfe to be, or is indéede the seruant of God, by whom a lawfull calling may be assigned him, howsoeuer he wade in the execution of his externall vocation, yet hée commeth to farre short of his true duety commanded, as he not onely meriteth no earthly or temporall benefits, but to be corrected with many stripes. As who so looketh into, or compareth his owne performance with the Commandements of God, shall finde himselfe

so farre behinde with God in thankefulnesse for his least benefits, as hée shall be driuen to confesse he is vnworthy of the Bread and Rayment, (be it neuer so meane) that hée inioyeth: which also, how meane soeuer it be, it is the gift of God, and in no other, nor by any other meanes made ours, but in Christ alone, without whom the greatest Riches, the most glorious Estate, and most wished earthly prosperity, becommeth a curse vnto them, that make them not theirs by him that is blessed for euer. Heathen men are thankfull vnto their false gods, for the supposed good turnes they doe receiue of them, and in recompence they do not onely giue verball thanks, but will offer vnto them, euen their dearest Children in Sacrifice, to shew their thankfulnesse. And yet such as receiue euery day new blessings of the true God, yea although their plenty and health neuer so much increase and continue, they will not offer vnto him the least part of their superfiuous store, in giuing it to the Poore, in whom euen Christ himselfe maketh Petition for a cup of cold water, (as it were) and yet can hardly obtaine it at their hands, that

will not sticke to affirme they are most thankefull to God. But know that God will not be serued as Men are. Masters can no further iudge of their Seruants and their seruice, then they sée: the idlenesse and loytering of their Seruants they may in presence obserue, but the hidden and concealed falshoods they cannot discerne: and if it be discouered, it is but by doubtfull meanes, as by coniecture, or report: but our great and all-knowing Master hath neuer his eye from our work; nay, he séeth and knoweth our wils, the secret idlenesse or vanity of the heart, howsoeuer the hands or lips may seeme to labour in the praise of God before men, he can finde out our counterfait holinesse, and dissembling thankes. It is no boote to tell men, We be thankfull to God, though men cannot reproue vs, nor distinguish betwéene our dissimulation and true thankfulnesse. Who would or could haue condemned Ananias and Saphira, that voluntarily gaue the most part of their goods to the vse of Gods people? & yet the holy Ghost finding their hypocrisie, gaue them the reward of death, for that which they concealed from men.
               
                  
Man could not haue found out the bribery of Gehezi, nor the hypocrisie of Iudas. It is a dangerous thing to dally with holy things, much more to dissemble with him that is most holy.
               Ingratitude is a contemptible vice, yet not so odious as is hypocriticall vnthankefulnesse, for by the one, man findeth apparantly, who are thought vnworthy of a second good turne, but by the other, man is drawne to doe a fauour vnto the vndeseruing, that by dissembling insinuation, and counterfait thankes for a former, obtaines a second kindenesse, when in truth hée is méerely vnthankefull for both: but God is not thus ouer-taken, he cannot deceine by dissembling gifts, nor be deluded by counterfeit thankes. And yet God oftentimes giueth new gifts, as health, wealth, honor, office, fauour of friends, a good wife, and dutifull children, and many such like earthly blessings, to the most vnthankefull, by which the mindes of carnall men are so much the more besotted, in obseruing that all things succéede so well, they thinke God is well pleased with them, flattering

themselues, that they stand much in Gods fauour, because their occasions succéede better then other mens, perswading themselues that to kéepe a formall & morall course of life among men, and to make a superficiall shew of thankfulnesse vnto God, and at their death to allot some matter of forced beneuolence to the World, as the building of an Almes-house, Hospitall, Colledge, or such like, is so high a recompence to God, for the loane of his benefits, as he resteth rather in such a benefactors debt for this good déede, then such a vaine-glorious giuer indebted to God for his long vsing and abusing of his blessings.
               By which, I condemne not such workes, tending to charitable vses, as are done in due time, and by men, first, séeking to be themselues in the true fauour of God, before they so séeke the glory and commendation of the world: for I presume to say, that the bestowing of mens goods, while they are their owne, by their owne hands, in secret to the needy members of Christ, is more acceptable to God, then the former (though commendable) intendments after their deaths: while we liue, wée

know what is for the time in our disposition, but after death wée cannot take knowledge what course will be taken with that we intend to best actions: neither doth the giuing after death, testifie a mans assurance of Gods prouidence, as doth the liberall giuing in time of life: for who so kéepes his treasure till hée dye, hee leaueth it perforce, and against his will, which no man can deny, and though he grieue to forgoe, he cannot feare to want them: but hee that giueth in his life time, giueth in assurance, that hée that gaue it him, and made the promise of rewarding the Giuers to the poore, dependeth so surely thereupon, as hée shall neuer want what may be sufficient, which indéede is a worthy testimony of truest thankefulnesse to God, for the things he enioyeth in this life.

                  Psal. 10. 17.
                  In my trouble did I call vpon the Lord, and cryed vnto my God, hee heard my voyce out of his Temple, my cry came before him, and he helped me,

                  I sought the Lord, and he heard me; yea, hee deliuered me out of all my feare,

                  Let the Lordline, and blessed be my strength, and the God of my saluation be exalted,
                  Psal. 18. 46.
                  Thou art my Lord, my well doing extendeth not to thee, but to the Saints that are in the earth,
                  Psalme 26. 2. 3.
               
               THough men by their best gifts cannot enrich God, yet they must bestow Gods gifts to the vse of his children, and that is the best recompence they can make vnto him for all his earthly blessings, and to be obedient vnto him according to his will reuealed in his Word, is the Sacrifice wherewith hee is pleased for all his benefits spirituall and corporall, which who so neglecteth, is meerely vnthankfull, what shewes so euer he maketh

of outward Thankesgiuing. Therefore euery faithfull receiuer of any his blessings, will fall downe before his Maiesty in this or the like manner of hearty thankfulnes, to manifest with his words, the inward willingnesse of the heart.

Jesus Christ the righteous did iustifie me by a liuely apprehension, and a faithfull féeling of his most frée merits, working for me, and in my behalfe.
                  These most swéete spirituall fauors so farre surmount the apprehension of the most wise in the world, and any féeling to the comfort of carnall men, that they cannot assure themselues of their owne saluation, a more miserable estate then which cannot light vpon man. How much then, Lord, am I wretched creature, bound vnto thy frée mercy, in choosing mee to be one of thine owne by Adoption, and to giue mée the earnest-penny of thy Spirit,

to assure mee thereof, and that so farre from presuming vpon any desert of mine owne, as I wholly condemne my selfe, and acknowledge all my hope and assurance to be wrought in me by thine owne frée loue, I vnworthy, deseruing nothing lesse, deseruing rather thine heauy and high indignation, and consequently thy iust Judgements, whereby, in stead of my frée election, I should be reiected, in stead of my redemption, I should be condemned, and to be retained in the fearfull power and bondage of Satan and hell: in stead of my sanctification and iustification, I haue merited reprobation, and yet, deare Father, in the abundance of thy fauors, I haue, and doe inioy the blessings of all spirituall comfort and contentment, and withall haue inioyed so many corporall comforts, and earthly graces at thy hands, as are more in number then my sinnes, which are more then the dust of the earth: my life I had of thée, the continuance thereof of thée: the health of my body thou preseruest, and when I haue beene sicke, thou hast healed me. In my hunger thou féedest mée, and refreshest me, when I am thirsty: thou cloathest me,

and which is more, thou bearest me as the Eagle doth her young, euen vpon the wings of thy prouidence: so that I haue bin defended from infinite imminent dangers, both from the perill of the sword, and the plague, and from the violence of many misfortunes which might haue befallen me, whereby had I not béene protected by thée, I had perished long agoe, and many times being poore, thou hast relieued mée: being e

And moreouer, which is not the least, (Lord) thou hast not onely giuen mée the vse of my limbes, and seruice of my senses, but hast taught my heart to conceiue, and my hands to performe that, by which, in thy prouidence, I profit in my calling, and liue.

            O Eternall God, powerfull, and true, which bringest downe to nought, & again aduancest: thou in mercy often correctest thy dearest children, and holdest them in by afflictions, lest their ouer-much liberty should giue them ouer-much scope to run astray, and consequently to sinne, and dishonour thy name, to their owne destruction. Therefore, O louing and most mercifull, and deare Father, I

giue thée the glory, I praise thy name, and I will magnifie thy goodnesse for euer.
            O Father. who hath looked vpon me in my troubles, but thou? who hath sustayned me, but thou? who hath fed me, but thou? who hath preserued me, but thou? who tooke me out of the Lyons mouthes, but thou? who relieued mée when I wanted things necessary, but thou? who hath deliuered mée in the time of danger, but thou? who shall haue the praise and glory, but thou, the God of my saluation, and mine euerlasting refuge?
            But what recompence, deare Father, shall I make vnto thée? what reward shall I giue thée? what sacrifice shall I offer thée? I am a worme & no man, I haue no good thing to present vnto thée, but onely I say, and confesse, and acknowledge euen from my heart and soule, with my tongue and lips, that thou onely art God, onely good, onely able, and willing to helpe the poore, to relieue the distressed, to comfort the abiect, and to deliuer them that are ready to be swallowed vp of mercilesse waters.
            I am poore, yet thou prouidest for

mée: I want, and thou giuest mée things expedient: I haue Enemies, but thou defendest mée from their tyranny: I am féeble, and weake, and fearefull to fall, but thou doest yet strengthen mée and vphold mée: thou leauest mée not in misery: thou forgettest mée not in my calamity, thou doest not euer hide thée from mée, nor turne thy face when I séeke thée, but thou rather hearest me before I call, and preparest mée salue before I vnfold my sore, and giuest before I aske, more then I can desire: Yea, Father, when I thinke my selfe ouer-whelmed with the troubles, that like raging waues doe follow one another, thou takest mée vp, and settest me on a sure Rocke, and when I begin to slide, and my faith séemeth to faile me, thou euen then, with thy helping hand dost hold me vp: so that neither the waters of this worlds troubles can altogether swallow mee vp, neither I altogether so fall, as if there were none to helpe me vp.
            Therefore, O Father, full of loue, full of power, full of compassion, and patient, to thée onely I yéeld praise, for my present reliefe and comfort: I

thanke thée for thy louing and fatherly helpe, who art absolute in thy prouidence, and therein raisest meanes to support thy Children, when they are in danger. And as thou of thy frée fauour in Christ thy beloued, hast at this time, and for euer deliuered mee, yea, when I was past hope; so continue my louing God, and helper, and Sauiour vnto the end: and as thou séest my Soule in aduersity continually: so be thou my continuall helper, that I may still sing vnto thee the song of praise, for thou art worthy to be praised, oh, thou art worthy to be praised: to thée be praise for euer.

            OH Lord of Hosts, Lord of heauen and earth, who defendedst Dauid from the malice of Saul, Hezekiah from the power of Senacherib, and all thy Children from their Enemies, so farre as was euer expedient for thy glory, and their soules comfort: I thanke thée, and blessed be thy holy Name for euer, for that thou hast not suffered mine Enemies to triumph ouer mée, buc hast most graciously deliuered mée from their malicious deuices, & hatefull inuentions. Thine eye hath séene their laying in wait for mée, and their wicked practices, and in thy prouidence

they are fallen, and I stand; they are snared, and I am deliuered; they are punished, and I am preserued. But it was not mine owne policy, mine owne power, wisedome, or sword, that hath kept them backe, it was thine owne will, thy worke, and thine is the glory: neither haue I escaped their wicked practices, because I was iust, nor because I was innocent: neither of which deserueth so much, but it was thine owne frée mercy in Jesus Christ, by which they are snared, and I am deliuered: and I doe acknowledge it, and doe confesse before all men, yea, I doe publish thy praise for thy goodnesse, who art my strength and my saluation: be thou euermore so, and I shall neuer be moued: be thou my rock, whereupon I may euer more rest saie. And grant that as I haue séene thy saluation, tasted of thy sauing health, felt the power of thy right hand, and béene partaker of so many of thy benefits and blessings: make mée able to glorifie thy Name, that as thou hast now disappointed mine Enemies of their hope, and weakned their power, as thou hast scattered them, & brought their deuices and imaginations to

And as thou diddest send Raphael thine Angell to conduct Tobias. And as thou diddest leade the Seruant of Abraham, and diddest guide Iacob in their iournies, euen by thy holy ministring Spirits: so doe I acknowledge, that thou hast béene this day with me in my iourney, thou hast brought mee in peace and safety vnto this place, wherein I may take my bodily rest and refection, hauing graciously protected mée from many secret dangers, not onely of Enemies,

Robbers, and Théeues, but also from danger and hurts of my limbes, which are commonly incident, and dee befall euen thine owne Children: blessed be therefore thy holy Name for euer. I giue glory vnto thy sacred and most glorious Name, for that thou hast not onely preserued me, but hast also blessed my iourney with such successe, as in thy wisedome is most for my comfort and profit: for in all things thou knowest better what is fit for man, then man: and therefore as thou hast béene pleased to deale with me, or shalt thinke hereafter fit for me: grant that I consult not with flesh and bloud, to finde the expediency of the successe of my iourney, knowing this, that we are ignorant of the things most conuenient for vs: And therefore whatsoeuer doth or shall succéede by thy prouidence, giue me wisedome, patience, and thankefulnesse to imbrace the same.

goodnesse and mercy, to blesse our Fields and Ground, and make them prosperous to yéelde their increase: for without thy fauour and blessing, the Earth can bring forth nothing, but vnprofitable and hurtfull wéedes, nor we by our endeauours make the same to prosper. Let not our grounds be desolate in thine indignation: shut not vp the Heauens in wrath for our sinnes, that it be not as Iron, nor our Earth as Brasse; but of thy goodnesse giue vs both the earely and latter raine, that wée may haue abundance of all Fruit. Thy Riuer, O Lord, is full of Water, prepare our Corne, and prosper our earth, crowne the yeare with thy goodnesse, and let the clouds drop fatnesse, let the P
                  •
               aines be replenished with Shéepe, and the Uallies with Corne, that the Possessors of the earth may be merry and reioyce. Preserue vs (O Lord) in the time of dearth, that wée perish not for hunger, nor be confounded in the time of danger: wée confesse our sinnes (O Lord) with groanings and griefe of heart vnto thée: heare our prayers in thy holy Habitation, and be mercifull vnto thy people, which haue transgressed thy holy

Commandements, and giue euery man according to his wants, that in all things wee may confesse and acknowledge with all reuerence, thy omnipotent and diuine power, and thy bountifull hand, with giuing thankes and continuall praises vnto thée, which hast giuen vs all things here to inioy.

               WHy shouldest thou feare or faint, O my poore soule, though yet thou finde no more rest then the Doue, that could finde no place to set her foot on? Be yet comforted, for the Lord hée is God, and hee turneth all things to good, to them that are his.
               Thou hast long sighed and bewayled thy miseries, and yet thou art as Ioseph, stil in prison: but looke not vpon the weake meanes of flesh and bloud, to be fréed: looke not vpon the staffe of

                  Egypt, the bruised Réede of carnall aide to be stayed by: they are but false allurings, to draw thée from the swéet contemplation of the admirable works of the worker of all good, the Lord of hostes, besides whom there is no God. He sitteth in glory in the Heauens, and hath cloathed himselfe with Maiesty. It is he that maketh all knées to bow, and forceth Kings to stoope, and driueth away the armies of his most mighty enemies.
               Hée is the hope, and strength, and helpe, and refuge, and rescue, and reliefe of them that trust in him: and hée is not curious or coy, as man that worketh for money: hée doth not good for good againe, but all in loue, all in mercy, fréely, and wanting no power to bring to passe what hée will: either in mercy to his children, or in iudgement against his enemies.
               For the heauens are his seate, the earth is his foot▪ stoole, the Angels are his ministers, and all creatures serue him, and that for man onely. I will not then dismay, though I cry yet, and be not yet heard: there is an appointed time, and there is an appointed meane in his prouidence already

decréed in my behalfe, I know well by his promises, which are Yea and Amen.
               
               Therefore be yet patient, O my soule: trust yet, O my soule: stand fast, and this God, yea, this high and glorious God, this great and terrible God, will be thy kéeper, thy Sauiour and protector euermore.
               Hée is an immaculate God, a God pure, perfect, & holy: feare him therefore. O my soule; for as hée is cleane, he will haue thée cleansed from all impiety, hée will haue thée beautified with sanctity and holinesse, as hée is holy: no euill dwelleth in him, sinne must not remaine with thée, flye therefore all impiety, and embrace the righteousnesse of Christ, who will put on thée his robe of righteousnesse, and thou shalt be perfect. And this God then shall be with thée, this God, I say, shall be thy refuge for euermore.
               Though he sit in the high heauens, not séene with the eye of flesh, nor can be reached vnto by the hand of natural reason, yet he commandeth all, & doth euen what he will, both in heauen and in earth.
               So powerfull he is, so magnificent, and so absolute in power, that at his

word the earth trembleth, the mountaines moue, and in his displeasure he killeth euen Kings for his righteous childrens sakes.
               The heauens aboue doe shew the glory of this God, and the artificiall frame of the firmament, the glistering Stars therein, the Sun and Moone, and their due courses vnchangeable throughout all ages, and the beautifull ornaments of the earth beneath, do approue the admirable workes of his hands.
               His voyce is a mighty voyce: for he speaketh, and it is heard from one end of the world to another: his voyce is a terrible voyce, at which all powers, Princes, & Potentates doe tremble.
               That mighty Nebuchadnezzar at his voyce, was thrust forth into the field among the wilde Beasts, from his Throne: and Dauid from the wildernesse, called backe to sit in the seate of honour: by him was Haman hanged, and Mordecay deliuered, Susanna cleared, and the Iudges stoned.
               Euery Kingdome is this great Gods, and hée raigneth ouer all Nations: hée controlleth, and is not controlled: he 
                     ••
                  iteth, and is not resisted:

thée aduanceth, and none can throw them downe.
               O my Soule, feare, and serue, and loue, and reuerence, & obey this great God, this Lord high and terrible, that approueth himselfe a King ouer all the earth, being guarded with such inuincible power and maiesty, that hée can strike Saul to the ground with his terrible voyce, and againe raise Saul with a louing and kinde hand.
               O Lord, how terrible art thou in thy works? Through the infinite greatnesse of thy power, thou hast made all things, and preseruest all men: insomuch as all such as séeme to deny thée, thy power and prouidence, the fooles that say in their harts, there is no God, are made mute, and put to silence, and both their will and their practises made all subiect vnto thy will and pleasure.
               What then? shall I rest amazed at the friuolous inuentions of fleshly men, that séeme by their owne power to build themselues Babels on earth, working terrour to the poore by their pride, and practice impiety without any remorse of conscience?
               No, I will kéepe silence, and neither mine owne wants, nor sorrowes,

nor dangers, nor the worlds ignominious taunts at my base estate, shall wrest me from this glorious God, from this powerfull Iehouah, from this so louing and kinde a father: that feareth not the strength and forces of millions of Kings, but shieldeth and defendeth his by his mighty hand, and kéepeth them safe in the flaming fire, in the raging seas, and in the strength of the Lyons pawes.
               Let this God, I say, arise and chase his enemies, and cherish his little ones, and pull downe the proud, and set vp the simple, and scatter the wicked, that they dwel not beyond his time appointed to tyrannize ouer his chosen vpon the earth.
               The Chariots of this God are twenty thousand Angels, the Lord himselfe being among them the generall worker of all good for all his, and of all iudgement against the vniust.
               All the gods that are estéemed as Gods among men, are but Idols, but the Lord he is God, that hath couered himselfe with light, as with a garment, whereby hée discouereth all darkenesse, infidelity, disobedience and sinne: he findeth out the faithlesse,

howsoeuer they dissemble zeale, and approueth them not most godly, that are most glorious, nor them reprobates that the world reiecteth: but through the light of his most high wisdome and prouidence, he yéeldeth to euery one his owne: to him that doth well, life, and reliefe, and succour, and patience, and rest, and peace: but vnto the wicked, sorrow, and anguish, and tribulations, and a worme euer deuouring, in perpetuall horror in hell fire.
               O my soule, be therefore patient in these transitory troubles, in these momentany afflictions: stand fast, faint not, feare not, flie not, but féed on hope; for a strong helpe commeth, & for this smal suffering, thou shalt receiue a perpetuall and most admirable waight of glory.
               O my soule, now consider: whom hast thou in heauen but this God? or whom, or what desirest thou in earth in comparison of him? for hée is the portion of thine inheritance, he filleth the cup of saluation vnto thée for euer: therefore I feare not, neither will I faint, for this God hath promised, neither to faile me, nor forsake me.
               
                  
There is none like vnto God, Oh righteous people, which rideth vpon the heauens for thy helpe, and on the clouds in his glory.
               The eternall God is thy refuge, and vnder his arme thou art for euer: he shall cast out the enemy before thee, and will say, Destroy them, Deuteronomy 33. 26. 27.
               O the deepnesse of the riches, both of the wisdome and knowledge of God! how vnsearchable are his Iudgements, and his wayes past finding out! Rom. 11. 33.
               Of him, and through him, and for him, are all things: to him be glory for euer, Amen. Vers. 36.
               They inherited not the Land by their owne sword, neither did their owne arme saue them: but thy right hand and thine arme, and the light of thy countenance, because thou didst fauour them, Psal. 44. 3.
            
            
               
               A sweet Meditation concerning the knowledge and prouidence of God, whereby the soules of the distressed members of Christ, are so quickened through faith in Christ, that they rest assured, that God hauing foreseene all things, cannot but in mercy, bring all their sorrowes to a ioyfull and wished end.
               IT is in vaine I sée, for me a wretched creature, to striue with my powerfull Creator. If I should séeme to bide me from him, and to séeke to escape his rod and corrections, he being alwayes solitary, I doe but deceiue my selfe, for he is in all places, and with all persons, and knoweth the wayes of men, & searcheth the hidden thoughts within, and soeth mine actions without: the workes of his children hée séeth and approueth, the euill actions of the reprobates hée séeth and condemneth: yea, this righteous God tryeth the very hearts and reynes: he findes out the hidden dissimulation of

hypocrites, pretend they neuer so great denotion and sanctity. Should I therefore thinke to colour my sinnes with the painted shew of dissimulate holinesse, could I performe it so farre, as men might approue of all my sayings, and allow all my doings, and that I were held iust? No, no: for if my inner parts be not perfect, hée in his most absolute knowledge findeth me a deceiuer, and so will make mine euils at the last breake out as the morning light.
               O my soule therefore, as thou tenderest thy saluation to come, and my comfort here in this life, leaue off to sinne in secret, and flie al shewes of impiety, and regard truth, and imbrace iustice, and follow good, euen with thy most inward affection: and let neither my hand, nor mine eye, nor mine eare, nor my tongue be instruments of iniquity, but rather of sincere piety, and of a sanctified life.
               The cause of misery is sin, the way to obtaine mercy is repentance, and a reformed conuersation.
               How canst thou looke for loue, that louest not to liue well? and how canst thou liue, and not lacke many, yea, all

Gods blessings inward and outward, vnlesse thou loue him, and reforme thy selfe before him, that séeth thy loose behauiour towards him?
               Thou art in outward pouerty, because thou art full of inward impiety: thou hast many enemies, because thou art enemy to God: and thy dangers encrease daily, because thou dwellest not in God, nor Gods Spirit in thée.
               Thou sayest thou art Gods, and yet vngodly: thou sayest, thou fearest him: and yet thou still offendest him: thou thinkest thou shouldest receiue what good thou destrest, and yet thou destrest amisse, and deseruest euill.
               God knoweth who are his, and who are not his: and none know they are Gods, but who know God, and serue him rightly. The righteous onely he knoweth, and their wants, and the vnrighteous he despiseth because of their sins, wherein they say, Tush, the Lord will not regard it.
               
               O Lord, thou séest and beholdest, thou findest out and considerest all mens wayes: mischiefe and wrong, equity and iustice are before thée, and thou takest the causes of men into

thy hands, and thou giuest iust iudgement, because thou onely knowest the truth of euery mans cause.
               The poore commit themselues to this God that knoweth them, to this God that séeth them, and to this God that pittieth them, and prouideth for them.
               The Lord looketh downe from heauen vpon all men, such is the force of his knowledge, that hée knoweth in man, more then the heart of man it selfe: for he fashioneth the heart, and vnderstandeth all my thoughts long before they be conceiued within me.
               And therefore, my soule, prepare thée to patience, addresse thée to praise God, and continue in prayer, be not idle to meditate good things, that the Lords goodnes may be thy goodnesse, that his loue may be thy life, and his prouidence thy protection: for as hée knoweth thy going, and marketh well thy wandring, when thy féele follow value things, and fatherly correcteth thée for them: so doth hée behold thy teares, and heareth thy groanes, which thou makest for sinne committed against him, and healeth thée, and comforteth thée. Yet all things are so hidden

in the treasure-house of his prouidence, that the naturall man séeth not the meanes how to be cured when hée is sicke, how to be raised againe being brought low, how to be defended hauing many mighty enemies: But the Spirit of God discerneth, and as he is God, knowing all things done, so he is a God, fore-séeing al things to be done hereafter.
               And hée séeing mée in my mothers wombe before I was any thing, or dained for me then, what I receiue now, & therefore my hope must not faile, but take hold of his ancient loue, wherein hée first created me to liue in him, and by him: and therfore, Oh, that I might be able truely to serue him, that hée might louingly relieue me still, that I might faithfully obey him, that hee might fatherly helpe me still.
               He is the good shepheard: Oh that I were a good shéepe of his pasture: hee féedeth, and guideth, and holdeth vp and comforteth, and maintaineth all that are his: hée looseth none that are his, he confoundeth none that are his, neither doth he forsake any of his vnto the end.
               Within his fold is his fauour, and

in his fauour is life, and in that life is liberty, and in that liberty is reliefe, and in that reliefe true peace, and in that peace the assurance of saluation, and in that assurance, the ioy and comfort of the Spirit, whereby euery outward vnsauory thing is made inwardly swéet: euery crosse hath his comfort, and euery tryall, and temptation, and sorrow, and griefe, is turned to the vnspeakable good of the shéepe of his pasture.
               Therefore, O my soule, sigh no more, sorrow no more, be no more pensiue at outward pouerty, fret no more at the worlds miseries, dismay no more for thy many sinnes, but striue to stand in the fauour of this God, and he will set thée frée, and banish thy feare, and fill thy Cup, and féede thée with the hid treasures of his neuer-failing loue.
               O Lord increase my Faith.
               
                  God knoweth the hearts of all men,

               A Godly Meditation of the Word of God, whereby men distressed, may be strongly resolued to cast off all feare, and to cast all their care on God, that careth for them, according to his promise in his Word.
               OH, what am I, that I should conceiue of any happinesse, or glory, or ioy, or comfort to be giuen mee, either in this earth below, or in the heauens aboue? for I am a man of corrupt conuersation, my heart is fraught within mée with corruption, my soule is defiled, and my whole man polluted. Is it not therefore my iust portion to

haue here misery, and calamity, and crosses, and enemies, and euils innumerable, to follow me for my sinne, and to vexe me for mine iniquities? so hath the Lord threatned in his word.
               Most true it is, that right it were, that I should receiue these vnsauoury things of this life, and to be depriued of the Land of them that liue for euer, if I should receiue according to my deseruings: for death is due for sinne, O wretched man that I am, who shall deliuer me from this danger of death, that shall neuer haue end!
               Surely, when I looke into this book of mine owne wayes, and workes, and wantonnes, and wicked life, I sée nothing but danger, and feare, and sorrow, and death it selfe, written therein: how then, my poore soule, vnhappy soule, wretched soule, how canst thou escape? oh, tremble and feare: for i
                     •
                   thou finde not fauour, thou are fallen for euer, and for euer forlorne.
               Where then wilt thou séeke for succour? to whom wilt thou flye for grace? to the weake, and wicked, and wofull World, or wanton worldlings? No, my Soule, flye from these feeble friends, and looke into, and consider,

and beléeue, and imbrace the Word of God: taste that Bread of life, drinke of that Fountaine that floweth from the liuely Spirit of truth, & thou shalt liue. It is a pure Word, and will purifie thée: it is a liuely Word, and will reuiue thée: the Word of truth, and will teach thée: the Word of comfort, and will recomfort thée.
               O my soule, what thing is so precious as this Word, that bringeth the glad tidings of thy saluation, thou deseruing damnation? of Life, thou deseruing death? of Comfort, thou deseruing confusion? and of mercy endlesse, thou deseruing miseries infinite?
               It is a Word full of consolation, to such as are sorry for their sinnes, and séeke after righteousnesse: a Word of terror to the obstinate: it is a killing sword vnto the wicked, and sauing shield vnto Gods children: the sauour of Life vnto life, to them that are his: and the sauour of Death vnto death, to the wicked. It is more to be desired, then the purest gold, or swéetest hony: Come vnto me (saith this Word) and I will refresh you. Seeke (saith this Word) and you shall finde rest for your soules.
               
               
                  
O my Soule, here then to thy rest, here is thy safety, and here is thy saciety, and here is thy life and liberty, and here shalt thou dwell as vpon the Mountaine of Peace, vpon the Rocke of Reliefe, and Hill of continuall Helpe.
               This is the Staffe to stay thée by, this is the Weapon to defend thee with, this is the Way to walke in, and this is the Foode to relieue thée withall.
               Oh, reioyce therefore in the Lord, O my soule, because of his Word, by which he assureth thée of health, if thou be sicke: of comfort, when thou art sad: of defence, when thou art in danger: and of his presence, when thou séemest to be left alone, forsaken of all.
               By his Word, hée saith, Come: by thine obedience, say, Lord, I come: delay not to cast away the superfluous eare of carnall things, and séeke things spirituall and heauenly.
               By his Word, he saith, Seeke first the Kingdome of God: answere thou, by a detestation of the World and worldly vanitie, Lord, thy Kingdome I seeke: séeke then this heauenly Inheritance, more to be wished then the Land, and

Reuenewes, and Riches, and glory of the greatest earthly subiect, who hath but the casuall, and vaine, and slippery things of this World, that leaue him, and wée leaue them: but, loe, a Kingdome is prouided in Heauen for the poorest Childe of God. Séeke this Kingdome, O my Soule, euen while thou art here in this vast Wildernesse of this Worlds miseries: for when thou hast suffered, thou shalt receiue glory: and when thou hast fought that good fight, thou shalt be crowned: and when thou leauest these things so vile, and vaine, and loathsome below, thou shalt enioy things glorious and swéet, and full of ioy and consolation aboue: when thou hast left the society and fellowship of men below, thou shalt accompany Angels aboue: and when thou hast made an end of sighing, and grieuing, and groning, vnder the burthen of tyrannous men here, thou shalt sing praise and glory to this glorious God aboue, who hath sent thée his Wordhere in thy mortality, to comfort thée with the swéet contemplation of thine immortality.
               Oh, then let this be thy daily meditation, let this be thy continuall exercise,

that in want and weaknesse, in sorrow, and ignominy, and misery, and crosses, and temptations, and in al trials whatsoeuer, thou mayest duely weigh, how thou maiest be assured, that none of these shall hurt thée: for, loe, euen this glorious, and swéet, and most ioyfull word telleth thée from thy louing Redéemer; My grace is sufficient for thee.
               
               O swéet word of truth, yea of truth: for hée speaketh and performeth: his grace is sufficient: what then shall I feare? If his fauour be not further off but alwaies at hand, what shal I scare? if it be sufficient, what can resist it? nothing but sinne: nay, his grace is sufficient to kill sinne: then nothing can stand betwéene me and this Kingdome of God, if I flye vnto this Word, if I kéepe this Word, and meditate this Word, & bring forth the fruits of this Word: then this Word will further assure me, that this good God, this powerfull, prouident, and louing God, will neuer faile me, nor forsake me.
               O Lord increase my Faith.
               
               
                  The word of God is liuely, and mighty in operation, and sharper then any two-edged Sword, and entreth thorow, euen vnto the diuiding a sunder of the Soule and the Spirit, and of the ioynts and the marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts, and the intents of the heart,

O my soule, trust in him, and thou shalt be fed, and shalt haue cause to reioyce in him, and to sing praises vnto his name: for trusting in him, his mercy shall compasse me about, and comfort mee with ioyfull deliuerance, yea, none that trusteth in him shall perish.
               The eyes of the Lord are vpon them that trust in him: trust in him, O my soule; then shalt thou say, I sought the Lord, and hee heard mee, and deliuered mee, and relieued mee, and defended mee, and brought mee out of all my dangers.

               A necessary Meditation, concerning the vncertainty of mans happinesse in this life, and the certainty of the endlesse happinesse of the children of God in the life to come, notvvithstanding their present miseries here.
               MJne eyes haue séene, and mine heart hath duely considered the fickle, and fraile, and féeble, and vncoustant happinesse of man in this life; yea, I my selfe haue found by experience, that this world administreth vnto man no periect comfort, while hée liueth vpon the earth.
               Yet flesh & bloud, the foolish outward man, besotted with the vaine delights of sinnes deceits, and snared with the baits of vaine hope, the pleasures, and comforts, and glory, and ease, and fulnes of earthly vanities, thinketh himselfe safe, and in state of such sure and neuer-failing happinesse, that he walloweth

in the mire of deceiuing security, vntill at vnawares the hand of the liuing God be stretched out against him, and either turneth his hope to despaire, his glory into shame, his ease into trouble, his fulnesse into want, or all the vaine things wherein he delighteth, into griefe and sorrow.
               O my soule, trust not therefore in the transitory trash, and pelfe, & wealth of this world, for it deceiueth and deuoureth men; and as the rust and can
                  
                     •
                  er eateth and wasteth iron, so doth the loue thereof deuoure thy trust in God, and thy practice of better things.
               Trust not in worldly friends, for their words are vaine, their promises not performed, nor their helpe worth thy hope. It is better to put confidence in the Lord, then to trust in Princes; for they who haue their breath in their nostrels, are but men, whose power is of the earth, and whose hands are féeble, and their deuices vaine. Some trust in chariots, and some in horsemen: but (O my soule) trust thou in the liuing God: be doing good, and thou shalt remaine, when the foolish man that beleeueth in flesh, and

dependeth on earthly meanes, shall fall and perish.
               
               Be not carried away, O my soule: therefore, with the hope of any mans helpe, nor feare what man can doe against thée: for suddenly is thy friend taken from thée, and he that séeketh thy destruction▪ brought to a fearefull end. Thy happinesse is not to haue heapes of gold and siluer, many friends, and all earthly abundance: for the abuse of these are dangerous, because they draw thée from séeking God, and they are short, and bring thée to destruction, leauing thy carkase naked in the graue, and thy selfe, O my soule, in the mercilesse pit.
               What auailed the rich mans worldly pleasures, when hée went suddenly to hell? What hindred the beggers pouerty, when hee went immediately to heauen?
               How was Iob impouerished, hauing mighty wealth? What miseries doe follow the mightest men, is daily séene, and how terrible the end is of such as haue not the Lord their strength, but put their trust in the multitude of their riches?
               Who can say, The wealthy man is

happy? When he sléepeth, he sléepeth in feare: when he walketh, he walketh in danger; and when hee is in his best age, strongest body, and best state, hée suddenly dieth, and leaueth his wealth he knoweth not to whom.
               And who can say, the poore, fearing God, is vnhappy in his basenesse, and want, and i
                     •
                  nominy, sith hée setteth his hope vpon the neuer-failing God? he séeketh his helpe from heauen, and is fed as with the dew thereof? onely hope sustaineth him, and his want is timely supplied with wished necessaries, and his heart comforted in his déepest miseries: he lieth downe in faith, and patience, and thankefulnesse, and the Lord sustaineth him, and when he dieth, he liueth, and raigneth, and reioyceth in God his Sauiour.
               O that I might haue no delight in the vaine things of this world. O my soule, be at peace within mée, when I haue warres without me, be contented, and grudge not, when I want the outward fulnesse of worldly things: for I sée and consider, that carnall meanes cannot saue me, but the mercies of the Lord, wherein he affordeth vnto his faithfull ones all things to enioy.
               
                  
Though he make me a reproach among my friends, and though hée suffer me to stand a gazing stocke before the eies of the wicked, who triumph in their owne glory, gotten by their owne hands and deuices, and the Lord none of their counsell, I will not yet be dismayed, neither will I be moued at their prosperity: for I know, the day of their sorrowes commeth on, when they shall howle, and cry out in horror, for the paines that 
                     •
                  nsue their pleasures, and for the want that shall follow their wealth, and for the miseries that shall follow their mirth, and for their death that shall follow their glorious and wanton life.
               Oh, how foolish are they that trust in their goods? how mad are they that make wealth their warrant, and riches their arme, and friends their staffe, when none of these can saue them from sicknesse, from sorrow, from dangers, nor from death?
               No man can redéeme his brother from Gods displeasure, and from his appointed torments in hell, by his much wealth: he cannot saue himselfe by the multitude of his riches: but God shall deliuer thée, my soule, from

the power of hell, and shall saue me.
               Be not therefore afraid, O my soule, though many be made rich, and thou in pouerty: many aduanced, and thou reiected; many graced, and thou disdained; many comforted, and thou iniured among the sons of mortall men: thy riches, and thy glory, and thy fauour, and thy comfort, and thy ioyes are hid in Christ with God.
               And what thinkest thou, O my soule, of these short miseries, that shall be exchanged for infinite comforts? whether is it not profitable for thée to haue these moment any corrections, to enioy an eternall crowne? thou hast tried the inconstant course of worldly things, and the day is comming wherein thou shalt possesse the permanent consolation of heauenly things.
               How long hast thou looked about thée for helpe in the earth? Vpon my right hand I looked, and behold, none that would know me, or comfort me (as Dauid saith) and vpon my left hand, and no man I found that cared for my soule.
               
               Then I cryed vnto the Lord, & said, Thou onely art my hope & my portion, in whom I liue, & haue an vnmoueable being.
               
               O Lord increase my Faith.

                  The children of men are vaine, the chiefe men are lyers, to lay them vpon a ballance, they are lighter then vanity it selfe,

               A sweete Contemplation of Heauen, and heauenly things, whereby the sad distressed soule is much comforted, and encouraged to endure vnto the end, that he may possesse the ioyes prepared for such as patiently suffer, and without grudging beare the burthen of this worlds miseries.
               
                  O My soule lift vp thy selfe aboue thy selfe, flie away in the contemplation of Heauen, and heauenly things: make not thy further abode in

this inferiour region, where is nothing but trauels and trials, and sorrow, and woe, and wretchednesse, and sinne, and trouble, and feare, and all deceiuing and destroying vanities.
               Bend all thine affections vpward vnto the superiour place, where thy Redéemer liueth and raigneth, and where thy ioyes are laid vp in the treasury of his merits, which shall be made thy merits, his perfection thy perfection, and his death thy life eternall, and his resurrection thy saluation. Estéeme not the trifling pleasures of this life, to be the way to this wealth, nor the ignominious estate here, to be any barre to preuent thée from the full vse, and ioyfull fruition of the glory there prepared for thée.
               I am assured, that though I want here, I shall haue riches there, though I hunger here, I shall haue fulnesse there; though I faint here, I shall be refreshed there, and though I be accounted here as a dead man, I shall there liue in perpetuall glory.
               That is the Citie promised to the Captiues, whom Christ hath made frée: that is the kingdome assured to them whom Christ shall crowne; there

are the ioyes prepared for them that mourne: there is the light that neuer shall goe out: there is the health that shall neuer be impaired: there is the glory: that shall neuer be defaced: there is the life that shall taste no death: and there is the portion, that passeth all the worlds preferment: there is the world that neuer shall waxe worse: there is euery want supplyed fréely without money: there is no danger, but happinesse, and honour, and singing. and praise, and thankesgiuing vnto the heauenly Iehouah: to him that sitteth on the throne, to the Lambe that here was led to the slaughter that now raigneth: with whom I shall raigne, after I haue runne this comfortlesse race, through this miserable earthly val
                     •
                  .
               The honour in this earth, is basenesse, the riches of this world pouerty, the fulnesse of this life is want: the ioyes of this worlds kingdome are sorrow, and woe, and misery, and sadnesse, and griefe: and yet the foole saith in his heart, There is no other heauen, but this harmefull deceiuing worlds happinesse, no other hell but this worlds bitternes, no better comfort

then this worlds cares, nor further helpe then this worlds wealth.
               Thus is mans wisedome made foolishnesse, and mans glory turned into shame, & mans power made of no force. And the faithfull poore that are here despised, there are aduanced: the sorrowful are comforted, & the cast awaies in this world are receiued to that blessed being, that cannot be expressed with the tongue of man, nor conceiued with the heart of man.
               Oh that I had wings (saith heauenly-hearted Dauid) that I might flie away from this worlds vanities, and possesse heauens happinesse. Oh, that I were dissolued (saith blessed Paul) that I might be with Christ. Oh, that I were in this place of such wished happinesse, where I might rest from these worldly labours, and earthly miseries, and transitory vanities.
               But be not heauy, O my soule, though thou must yet wade through the sea of these earthly troubles: for these heauenly mysteries are not séene of carnalleyes, nor can be obtained by carnall meanes, but through troubles and afflictions, and dangers, and persecutions, they must be atchieued:

and none that are Gods elected, shall be frée from this Worlds hatred: for such difference there is betwéene earth and heauen, and betwéene earthly and heauenly things, that who so delighteth in the first, shall be depriued of the latter: for we cannot haue this worlds heauen, and the Heauen of heauens, the heauen of Saints, and Angels, and Cherubins, and Seraphins, where are all vnspotted, and all glorious, and all in white Robes of sanctity, and where Christ, the sacrificed Lambe, is vnto them all in all.
               Oh blessed are all they that are thus assured: blessed are the Poore that shal haue this heauens riches: blessed are the Base that shall be thus aduanced: blessed are the Low that shall be thus raised: and blessed are the Worlds despised, that shall haue this heauens happinesse; yea, happy is this wretched worlds vnhappy man, for hée shall be happy.
               I will daily meditate of the greatnesse and Maiesty of this high heauens blessed estate, where I shall one day blesse my God, with the company of his Saints, and where I shall one day sit secure and frée from the dangers,

perils, crosses, and afflictions that now doe assatle mée on the right hand, and on the left, within mée, and without me, and am neuer frée from one calamity or other.
               But it is good for me to be here humbled, that I may be there aduanced, where I wish spéedily to come. It is good that I was in want here, that I might séeke heauenly necessaries. It is good that the World did discourage me, that I might flie to God that comforteth me. It is good that I am daily killed here, that I might liue continually there.
               Now therefore, O my soule, stand vp, feare not, faint not at this worlds crosses: but giue glory to this great God, praise this high and helping God, séeke him while it is to day, driue not off to pray to this God, notwithstanding any hope thou hast in mortall men; nor reiect not his gracious means, who in fauour infinite, and mercy endlesse, moueth the hearts of men in this life, to doe good vnto such as hée séeth distressed; he can finde out and afford infinite meanes to succour them that are his, and will not leaue them forsaken in danger: for hée euen

here giueth mée his blessings, as pledges of his neuer-failing lout, that being visited in his mercy with timely comforts here, I may assure me of greater blessings in Heauen, where they are prepared beyond all that I can aske or thinke.
               O Lord God of Hosts, who is like vnto thee, who hast established thy Kingdome with truth and equity, with mercy and iudgement? thou hast a mighty arme, strong is thine hand, and high is thy right hand, who so is vnder thy protection, he is safe, and hée that trusteth in thée, mercy imbraceth him on euery side.
               Oh, blessed art thou, O my soule, if thou canst reioyce in the Lord: he is thy Father, he is thy helper: walke therefore in the light of his countenance, and be patient: wait in hope, till these stormes be past, and then shalt thou haue that quiet rest, that he hath

                  repared in heauen for thée.

               A consideration of the dangerous estate of the impenitent wicked ones after this life, notwithstanding their wealth, and power, and great glory, which they haue here, where they seeme to triumph ouer poore 
                     •
                  istressed men.
               Read and consider, yee Rich and Poore.
               IT is a strange temptation vnto a man, when he findeth himselfe still afflicted, notwithstanding he séeketh

helpe continually at the hands of God, and the more, when he séeth that such as neither serue God, or feare God, such as are wanton and wicked, and hardened in sinne, to prosper and to flourish in this life, and to haue all things that their hearts can desire.
               
                  Dauid beholding this, began a little to stagger, and was ready to giue ouer his godly beginning, and to end with the wicked: and as long as he tooke no better regard, but onely as naturall wisdome led him, he commended their estates, because they were rich, and wanted nothing, they were healthfull and lusty, and their goods did increase, which Worldlings hold true happinesse.
               But when Dauid considered their greatnesse, as it was discouered vnto him by the light of true knowledge, hée then altered his conceit of these Men, and renounced their wayes, and hated their workes, and auoided their company, and betooke himselfe to prayer, as the thing whereby hee should preuaile better, then with all the wealth the world could yéelde him.
               And surely, the present time affordeth vnto vs that now liue, no lesse

cause of vigilent regard, that we be not carried away with the World, whose glory is imbraced, whose power is practised, whose policy is preferred, and whose happinesse is had in greatest esteeme: insomuch as who so is poore, or helplesse, or distressed, or endangered in the World, by worldlings is censured a cast-away, a reprobate, a man forsaken of God.
               It is not vertue, nor godly life, nor inward zeale, nor any good quality of the spirit, that hath any fauour in the World: but the rich, and glorious, and men of countenance, and of power, and of office, and of gay attire, that be accounted Gods fauourites. As for such as are ragged, they are not regarded; such as are base in shew, are accounted base in déede. So that Gods children haue the least share of the worlds liberality: and the impudent, and shamelesse, and wicked, and worst men, are they that possesse and vsurpe the earth, and earthly glory.
               But alas, short and slippery is this glorious shew of theirs: they are as Ceda
                     •
                  s, that ouer-shaddow the low bushes for a while, but they shall be as stubble in the Furnace, when the

                  
                     •
                  re is put to their rootes. They are now as deuouring shée Beares, and as raging Lyons: but the time commeth, wherein the Lord will smite them vpon their iaw-bones, and will pull out the téeth of these mercilesse wretches.
               They haue set themselues in glory, but God shall turne it to shame: they haue fastened their footing, as they thinke, neuer to be moued; but the Lord will make their standing vnsure, and their wayes slippery, and their dayes short, and their end horrible.
               And howsoeuer they now make boast of their owne hearts wickednes, and though they séeme to contend with God, and subdue his members, and make no reckoning of his Saints, or thinke there is no God: God will finde them out, and he wil rebuke them with a perpetuall rebuke, and put out their name for euer, not onely out of the Earth, which they hold their Heauen, but euen out of Heauen, and his Booke of life.
               Who yet are commended, and estéemed, and aduanced, and reuerenced, but these men, of least merit? Onely

their riches, and their bribes, and their flattery, win them dignity, and preferment, and honour, and fauour, and what may fill them full of all tokens of perdition.
               But this is a heauy weight of temptation to the poore, that deserue to be made rich for vertues: for the low, that ought to be raised for praise-worthy qualities, when they sée that the worst are preferred for reward, and the best reiected for want.
               Surely, this World may be compared to the Poole of Bethesda, into which what diseased person stept first, was healed, but the strongest and best limmed, and hée that had best helpes, had alwayes the benefit of the healing: so now in this Puddle of worldly partiality, not the first that commeth is preferred, nor the most fit, but the most liberall giuer.
               But there is a Judge that sitteth and séeth, how the Worlds wealthy ones make others wealthy, not for worthinesse, but for gaine.
               What striuing, and strugling, and working, and inuenting, and swearing, and paines-taking, is there about the Phylosophers stone? Many a man

hath béene long hammering, and hazarding goods, and lands, and liberty, and life, and some pawne soule and all, to haue this strange meane to make himselfe a great man, and a rich man, and a wise man, and a cunning man, and a man to be admired at for his rare skill, and great wealth, and hidden wisedome: and while hée sought this stone of wisedome, hée became a foole, and a begger, and a laughing-stocke to them that become the wiser, to sée his ambition and folly.
               But hadst thou this stone, that could transinute Maluerne Hils into pure gold, and all the Earth into siluer, and couldest make thy selfe young againe, and lusty and strong againe, and haddest what thou couldest wish here in this life: what were this vnto thée? thou wert yet but a worldly wise man, a worldly rich man, a carnall man. But the Phylosophers stone indéede thou hast not found, which is, to feare God, and to imbrace his Word, and to be content with a competent estate: and therefore as impossible for thée to goe to heauen, as a Cammell to goe thorow a needles eye: But tush, thou wilt say, Abraham was rich, Lot was

rich; Iob was rich, and Salomon was rich: and yet they were in Gods fauour, and Gods elected ones.
               True it is, they were blessed of God in their riches, because they knew God, and beléeued his promises, They held not their wealth, but as meanes to relieue themselues and others: but thou holdest thy wealth to get vaineglory by them. They were bountifull and liberall where néede required, and had not the desire of money, as thou that hast neuer enough, and wilt depart from none: that by rapine, and wrong, and oppression, and bribery, and sinne, inrichest thy selfe. They vsed their wealth, as though they vsed it not, in respect of themselues, but to doe good to Gods children by it.
               Who can but imagine, that if the Phylosophers stone were to be contriued or compounded of the powder of poore mens hearts, and of the bloud of their owne soules, would not there be some of these stones composed by mercilesse men, that hate to be reformed, and say by all their cruelties, daily practised, that either there is not a God to recompence their wickednesse, or else that God séeth not, nor considereth

their oppression and wrong?
               These men yet prosper in the world, and say that these things are theirs: these things are Gods blessings: these things are to be disposed after their own hearts lusts, in vanity and pride, in wantonnesse and sinne: but to reléeue the necessity of the poore they haue no will: the words of worldlings warrant them, that they may doe with their owne what they list.
               But the word of God cryeth, wee to the rich, many more to the hardhearted and fast-handed rich Man: because there is no loue in him, or mercy, or compassion in him, the poore

               But God shall heare these afflicters of poore men; hée shall finde out their hidden mucke, and approue them lyers that say vnto the poore, I haue not for you; yea, God shall heare them, and afflict them: euen he that raigneth of old shall cast them downe, though they long flatter themselues in their prospority, and say, Wee will preuaile; who is Lord ouer vs?
               
               Let no childe of God therefore repine against these euill men, that haue

the world at will, who are so fat, and so well liking, as they hold themselues in most happy case. Let them alone, their day is comming, and their confusion commeth: they shall be cut downe like grasse, and wither as the gréen hearbe, and at last be cast into the vnquenchable Furnace.
               The Lord laugheth them to scorne, while they laugh the Poore to scorne, and the Lord out of Heauen thundereth terrour vnto them, while they worke trouble, and misery, and vexation against the Just, that dwell in

But consider (I say) consider thy state, and place, and pompe, and pride, and vanity well, and it shall all appeare but as a cloud that vanisheth away suddenly, like a glistering bubble in the Sunne.

               Hast thou any thing rightly to boast of, O thou foolish man, that estéemest the more of thy selfe for thy wealth and great glory, being the very meanes to make thée proud, and thy pride to make thée despise thy Brethren, and consequently God, that made thée and them? Were it not better for thée to become a Zacheus, to restore all thou hast wrongfully and sinisterly gotten, and of thy goods well gotten to giue halfe to the poore, that thou maist say, and be said to be rich in good things, because thou doest good? But to be rich and hoord it vp, to be rich and doe no good, is a badge of a man that shall neuer inioy the Kingdome of God.
               Were it not better to wéepe here, that wée may reioyce hereafter, then to reioyce here, and howle for euer? But wéepe, and howle, and lament, and be waile your selues, yée rich men, that haue no remorse: for the paines, and horror, and anguish, and torments

endlesse, shall be your reward if yée repent not, and reforme your euill wayes.
               Be no more stiffe-necked, nor couetous, nor disdainfull, but liberall, and humble, and helpefull to the people of God, that God in his mercy may make you rich in knowledge of good things, rich in practice, and rich in godly zeale.
               And be not grieued, though by this alteration you become poore: for a messe of portage, to one fearing God, is better then all the riches of the wicked.
               Hée is not poore, who loueth God: for God loueth him, and in his loue is life, and liberty, and liuely reliese.
               But who so feareth not God, haue be neuer so great abundance, is a begger, a cast-away, and a reprobate from the ioyes of heauen: the least of which cannot be purchased with millions of kingdomes: the least of them more worth then all your gold and siluer, and lands, and possessions, and offices, and honour, and what else the whole world, which deceiueth you, can afford.
               
                  
The Booke of God is full of terrible and sharpe threates against mercilesse rich men: and many woes the Lord (that loueth the lowly) pronounceth against the proud. And what a iudgement it is that their hearts are shut vp, that they cannot consider their end, to be as the Oxe that is fattened for the slaughter, who delighteth in the déepe féedings, while the Butcher determineth his death: as the couetous, and wanton, and wicked ones, take pleasure in their vanities, while their death and destruction commeth without redemption?
               But if these men will not heare, nor conceiue, nor consider the perill of their estate: if they will not, while the Lord may be found, séeke to returne, that they may be saued, their iudgement, and destruction, and reprobation will be the more iust.

                  are and precious: and therefore preferre their Oxen, and their Farmes, and their heapes of transitorie vanities, before the swéete banquet of a contented estate. And so farre they are from the true conceit of Gods purpose in punishing man, that they censure crosses that light vpon other men, as curses, and the glory, and riches, and mucke, and pelfe of their owne, to be giuen them, because they, and none else are blessed: whereby many times the deare Children of God are put to a déepe agony, when they

heare and perceiue the taunts, and reproofes, that the world and worldlings cast at them for their pouerty, and base estates sake. They stand before the worlds Gallant-ones, as Dauids men, that had the shirts of their garments cut to their buttocks, as men derided and scoffed, and as cast-awayes, and men forlorne and forsaken of all men: and cast downe and confounded by God himselfe: in regard whereof many times the poore, though indéede the very Children of God, are so ashamed of their estate, as they be forced not onely to auoide the familiarity of the wealthy, but euen to be séene of them a farre off: nay rather, they hide themselues as men cast off, or drosse from the gold: where indéede the Word of Truth findeth them out, and approueth them the refined gold, and the worldly-minded straw and stubble: prouided withall, that hée that is cast downe, must not so iustifie himselfe, as to argue himselfe the childe of God because hée is cast downe, because hée is made poore, or because hée hath enemies, or sicknesse, or want, or persecution: (for all these things may happen

also vnto the reprobate:) for as sin is the ground of all our afflictions, and our offences the cause of Gods displeasure, and Gods displeasure powreth forth crosses and curses too vpon sinners: So must euery man carefully consider how hee standeth in his troubles, whether hee haue fallen into the same by his own riot or lasciuious and wanton life, by his vngodly conuersation, and neglect of the feare of God; for which things sake, the wrath of God commeth vpon the children of disobedience, and he powreth out of the cup of his indignation vpon them, either in iudgement, because their condemnation shall here begin, and so be perpetuall, or else to reclaime them from their wicked waies, that they may be saued.
               And he that findeth himselfe in his conceit, lest deseruing afflictions, because he either féeleth not, or findeth, or will not acknowledge that he is such a sinner that deserueth so great punishment, as many times lighteth vpon other men: let him think that he in thus iustifying of his owne wayes, is in a dangerous state.
               It is the pride of the heart, which

God that searcheth it, well séeth, and considereth, that such a one is in a perillous way, if hée be not humbled. And surely godly Dauid himselfe was gone a little that way, and God saw that hée must pull downe this chosen vesell of his, before hée would tread his steps as he should: for as he confesseth himselfe, Before I vvas corrected, I vvent avvry, So that our troubles and miseries. and all the aduerse things that may befall vs, are Gods corrections to his children to reforme them: but his iudgements are messengers of his vtter renunciation to the obstinate, who by his punishments waxe worse and worse, and who murmure and grudge at the course that hée taketh with them to amend them, as did the rebellious Israelites, whom hée often visited in mercy, before hée entred into iudgement against them: So that none that standeth may say, hée cannot fall, none that are high may say, they cannot be brought low: for all haue sinned, and all haue néede of correction, all are sicke, and all haue néede of Physicke; all haue gone astray, and therefore all haue néede to be reclaimed. Who then will be ashamed of

Gods visitation? who will be impatient when afflictions come? Surely, none but the man that knoweth not God, none but hée that loueth this world more then heauen, and the pleasures of this life, more then the ioyes of the life to come.
               
                  Dauid was not ashamed of Gods corrections: for hée praised it as a great benefit, and tooke it as an high blessing, and said it was good for him. Was it good for him, and ill for vs? was it profitable to him, and hurtfull to vs? No, and therefore Paul was not ashamed of his crosses: for crosses make vs the companions of the blessed Children of God; nay, they make vs the more like to our elder brother, Christ Jesus, who finished our Redemptions through the Crosse, and made the way to the ioyes of heauen through afflictions, and he that is ashamed to follow him that way, he cannot come to him at all, hée will not know him, and therefore he shall neuer enter into that holy place, hée shall neuer attaine vnto that rest that shall be endlesse, and most ioyfull in the heauens.
               How vnsauory therefore soeuer our

troubles séeme, wée must be patient, and neuer giue ouer to cry vnto our helping Father, nor to vse our best endeauours in our callings, which God will blesse, staying our selues in hope vpon his promises. Let vs neuer dismay, for God that maketh this little wound without, doth it to cure a greater within: and while hée séemeth to kill vs, it is, that wée may liue euer: and while hée suffereth vs to be here ignominious, it is that wée may become all glorious with him in heauen.

            O Almighty and euerlasting God, who although thou art still in thy iudgement, yet art thou a mercifull God to the soule that séeketh théeth, infinite in thy mercy, and plenteous in redemption, for though thou send sicknesse, yet wilt thou shew pitty, according to the multitude of thy compassions, for thou dost not willingly chastice and afflict the children of men: therefore I poore wretched sinner, which am but dust, earth and ashes, vnworthy the least of thy fauours, doe fréely confesse, to thy glory, and mine owne shame, that I am conceiued and borne in sinne, that originall corruption, stayning and infecting my whole nature, hath depriued mée of all holinesse, and left in mee an inclination to all euill: and that I haue by mine innumerable transgressions, in thought, word, and déede, broken all thy holy Commandements, and therefore (besides all other euils) I haue iustly

drawne this sickenesse, and these diseases vpon me, yet not withstand, séeing that thou (such is thy excéeding great mercy) hast no pleasure in the miseries and destruction of thy Children, but doest onely by affliction try, correct, humble, and reforme them, for there present and euerlasting good: I doe therefore, most dear and louing Father, most humbly beséech thy heauenly Maiesty, to pardon my sins, the onely causes of my misery and affliction: increase and perfect in me all graces that concerne saluation: assist mée with the counsell and comfort of thy sacred Spirit, and conuert this my visitation to mine amendment, and saluation of my soule in Christ.
            If it be thy good pleasure and will (O Lord) restore me to my perfect and former health, that I may not onely performe my good purposes, and pay my vowes, which my lips haue promised, and my mouth hath spoken in my affliction, but also henceforth grow vp in grace, in obedience, in holinesse, vntill I come to the end of mine hope, which is the saluation of my Soule. But if it be thy will and decrée by this chastisement, to finish my dayes, I most

humbly and earnestly intreat thée (O my God) as the outward man decaieth, to renew in me the inner man, and to grant that as the body dyeth, so thy grace may liue and reuiue in me. Shut not the eies of my mind, but open them and make mee vnderstand what the hope of my heauenly calling is, and what is the riches of the glorions inheritance, that thou hast prepared for me, that I may liue in thy faith and obedience, and end my life in thy fauour, and when this life endeth, remaine and raigne with thée in glory for euer.
            Uouchsafe to be a Father to my family, kinsfolke, and posterity: plant thy feare in their hearts, confirme them in thy grace, and giue them all things competently necessary for the maintenance of this present life. Harken (O Lord to these my prayers, and grant me all other things, which thy heauenly wisdome séeth necessary for my soule or body, for thy dearly beloued Sons sake. To whom, with thy Maiesty, and God the holy Ghost, be rendred and ascribed all honour and glory, now and for euer.

Thou art all: sufficient, and in thy gifts manifold, thy loue is without limitation, and thy will without contradiction: what thou decréest shal stand, and what thou willest shall come to passe. Will thou therefore, will thou thy creatures, which thou hast ordained for the good and seruice of thy children, 
                  •
               o serue my vse, that I and mine may be sustained by thy prouidence: for what am I (Lord) that I should stand vpon mine owne power, wit, or policy, which are weaknesse and foolishnesse before thée? Thy Word preuaileth: speake, and all things in heauen and earth shall obey thée: yea, thine heauenly Angels shall be ministring Spirits for my good, and all the fruits of the earth shall adde comfort to my wretched estate. Good Father, sanctifie mée within and without, and fructifie my calling: blesse my endeuours, and teach me to vse my

function iustly, and as I ought, that I may so prosper in this present life, that I may truly pay all men their due, and owe nothing to any man but good will: a thing to mee impossible, but to thee easie to bring to passe. To thee therefore, I referre mée wholly: blesse me, that being blessed, I may prosper: that prospering, I may praise thée: and in praising thée, please thée, and be here comforted of thée, and liue righteously in thee, through the merits of thy beloued Sonne Christ Jesus, who hauing purchased all things for this life, and in the life to come for me, be with thée, and the holy Ghost, praised for euermore.

            A very comfortable and most patheticall Prayer, to be said of such as are in greatest distresse and danger, hauing wife and children, and in debt, not able to maintaine and relieue the one, or to satisfie the other.
            
               O Most mighty, mercifull, and all-knowing Father, the fountaine of all comfort and consolation, who findest out in thy déepe and allsearching knowledge, all the sinnes that are, or can be committed amongst the children of men, howsoeuer hidden and secret: I doe confesse vnto thée, against my selfe, that I haue grieuously offended thée by my manifold transgressions, and thereby haue drawne vpon mée, a most intollerable weight of thy deserued wrath, and fearefull indignation, insomuch as if thou maist not be pleased to mittigate thy 
                  •
               ury towards me, I shall faint, and fall, and shall not be able to lift vp my head any more, in hope of thy fauour: for, deare Father in Jesus Christ, I

am weake, and am not able to beare thy heauy displeasure by mine owne power or merit. And therefore, good Father, lay not vpon mée the punishments which I haue deserued: take away thy heauy hand of correction, and as thou art patient and long in suffering the sinnes of thy weake children, he yet patient with mée, and send thine holy Spirit to season me anew, that I may bring forth now the fruits of amendment of life. So shall thy punishment cease, and comfort increase, though I am heset with no small or few dangers, before mée, behinde mée, on my right hand, and on my left, I am beset with perils: so that which way soeuer I séeme to runne, or howsoeuer I couet to escape, I fall into dangers. What shal I doe, Lord, in these miseries? I stand amazed at the consideration, what will become of me languishing in fear, while there is none to helpe. I liue where none but mortall creatures are, and what can they doe to my comfort, Lord, that haue their breath in their nostrils? They mooue, and breathe, and liue, and speake: but little auaileth their helpe, vnlesse thou that guidest and gouernest the hearts

of all, vouchsafe to moue them to commiseration and patience with mée, I haue sinned (Lord) against thée, and am indebted vnto men, and cannot be released, and all commeth of my sins. Father, pardon thou me: so shalt thou in thy renewed loue send mée new reliefe. Raise me meanes to satisfie men, or qualifie their extremities, that they may be patient vntill thy helpe come: And in the meane time, teach mee, O teach mée the way that I should chuse. Direct mée Lord, what course I shall take: for thou, Lord, art wise and prouident, and mercifull, and all goodnes commeth of thée. Therefore, O Lord, instruct mée by the inward working of thy holy Spirit, to doe this or that, and make mée obedient vnto thy will: so shall all returne to my good. Raise vp some gracious meanes (Lord) for my succor: for thou knowest, though I be but one man, whose ruine can be but as the death of the least creature in the censure of such as feele not, nor partake of my griefes: neither will my ouerthrow grieue such as haue no share of my, miseries. Some there be yet, deare Father, whom thou knowest, that shall taste of the bitternesse of my

fall: and therefore, Lord, consider in mercy: and although none of them (Lord) that shall féele the smart of my calamities, but haue also added sinne vnto my sinne, and so aggrauated thy displeasure against vs, yet in thy Christ forgiue vs all, and reclaime vs all by thy gentle corrections, not by thy furious iudgements. And as a sparrow (Lord) lighteth not on the ground, nor one haire falleth from our heads, without thy prouidedre: so I know (Lord) that nothing shall befall mée, but what thou hast decréed, euen for my good, both in this life, and in the life to come. Thou hast neuer, Lord, dealt so sharpely with any, but vpon serious repentance they haue receiued comfort, they haue tasted of thy loue, and of inward peace. So worke, Lord, in these my tryals, and by these my crosses and dangers, that I be neither inwardly too much afflicted with feare and sorrow, nor outwardly too much cast downe with want, but as I taste of thy correcting rod, so I may also flude thy supporting staffe. Lord, thou art moued by a better Mediator, then are my complaints. Oh heare me for him, and heare him for mée: me, Lord,

for his sake; and him for thy promise sake, lest I remaining here in this vale of continuall miseries, where there is no true or liuely helper, I vtterly perish in my troubles. It is no true helpe, Lord, that commeth not of true compassion: and there is no true compassion, without true féeling of anothers miseries: but how far, Lord, that is from the hearts of many, thou knowest, and I féele it. And therefore euery heart truely moued to true commiseration, is first moued by thée. Oh moue them therefore, moue thou such as thou pleasest to vse as instruments of thy will for my good: so shall I vse it, and accept it as thy goodnesse, to thy glory. But, Lord, the course of thy prouidence teacheth vs, that thou wilt not haue thy dearest children to be lifted vp by the fulnesse of earthly things, aboue that which becommeth the humble, to kéepe them still in awe of thy corrections. Forere while, O Lord, I thought of seife-peace, little fearing further perils, nor to be thus chased anew, as I am, by such as séeke to molest mée, and to exact that from me by rigour, which thou knowest I am not yet able to performe: though thou

féest the inward destres of my heart willing, by my best lawfull endeuours to obtaine the meanes to satisfie al men their due, and it grieueth mee that I cannot doe as they require.
            And therefore (O louing Father) as thou well knowest what is wanting, supply it in thy mercies, in thy good time, before I be confounded altogether, and before I goe hence, and be no more séene. As thou blessest mée, O Lord, by the labours of my hands, so thou knowest I yéelde to them, to whom it is due. And therefore, Lord, sith they will not haue patience with mée of their owne accord, worke their hearts to be more pliable to my entreates: or else, which I aske especially, if it please thée, raise vp meanes for me, that I may be enabled to pay them all: wherein thy will be done. I haue séene thy saluation and deliuery already, in great dangers, and thy promise, and thy power, and thy prouidence are still in force, and thy mercy is no whit diminished, therefore (Lord) remember thy mercies, and looke on mée: and as thou saidst vnto the blinde man in the Gospell, Receiue thy 
                     •
                  ight, and he saw: so Lord,

say to mée, Receiue comfort and reliefe, and I shall receiue it: thy word is thy will, and thy will is thy worke, therefore speake, and thy will shall be done, to restore mee to constancy: let not the flouds of these dangerous waters ouer-flow mée quite, but when I am ready to sinke, yéelde mée thy helping hand and saue me: lift me out of the mire and clay of all my miseries, and set mée on the relieuing pastures of thy continuall frée fauours: let the chearefull dewe of thy blessings, and blessed graces showre downe vpon me, so shall my little store increase, and my empty basket become full. And forasmuch as I haue no frée portion in this earth, not the breadth of a foote: neither haue I of mine owne a house to hide my head in, put mée therefore where thou wilt, and let mine abode in earth be in what place, and how long, of short time thou wilt, for of my selfe, whither to turne mée, or what to doe I know not: Be thou therefore my guide, and direct all my desires of earthly things by thy Word, and let my will alwayes follow thy will, lest my will, led by the blinde affections of corrupt reason, bring me

mine owne preiudice and shame. Thou euermore prouidest for them that aske of thée, & directest them that take counsell of thée: therfore hauing thus weakly laid open my cause before thée, consider it, and giue me patience in all my trials, and let me not so much mourne, and hang down my head, and be heauy for the want of outward necessaries, as at the consideration and looking backe into the vgly gulfe of my former continuing sinnes. Oh, frée me, Lord, frée mée from my sinnes, and sanctifie me anew, that howsoeuer the outward man séeme to be discouraged, yet the inward man may be still more and more filled with all spirituall knowledge and consolation, and true contentment. Thou hearest my reproofes, thou knowest my sorrowes, and my groanes are not hid from thée: put my teares, few and weake, into thy bottle. Remember thy promises, and I shall neuer forget thy praises: Oh faile me not, forsake mée not my God, and my Redéemer.
            O Lord increase my Faith.
         
         
            
            A Thankesgiuing and Prayer to be vsed of a sicke man when he is recouered; oftentimes.
            I Yéelde and giue vnto thée (O mercifull and most deare Father) all humble thankes, honour, glory, and praise for thine infinite and excéeding great blessings, (hauing no way merited the least of them) and namely, for that it hath pleased thée of late to deliuer mée from the very point of death, and (as it were) raised my féeble body from the graue, and redéemed my soule from death, that I should walke before thée in the land of the liuing, that I might further glorifie thy name, doe more good in my calling, and be made méete for the inheritance of thy Kingdome. This worke, O Lord, procéeded from thy mercy, and no desert at all of mine, and for thy grace, and not of any goodnesse in mée: not vnto mée, not vnto mée, but vnto thy blessed name be giuen all glory. But séeing that I through my sinfull corruption,

am more ready to bury in the graue of obliuion, then to kéepe in thankfull remembrance thy great mercy, yea, and rather to grow cold & backward in all holy exercises and duties, then to holinesse of life: I therefore beséech thée, with all earnestnesse, to renew my nature, and to ingraue the remembrance of this thy goodnesse in my heart, by the illumination of thy holy Spirit, and grant that for the residue of my temporall life, I may in humility and truth be directed by thy most sacred Word, and alwayes submit my selfe to the gouernment of thy blessed Spirit. Make me (good Father) a light and example of vertue and godlinesse vnto others, and to grow in grace, as I increase in yéeres, that so I may liue in thy feare, and dye in true peace of conscience, and assurance of eternall glory with all the Saints and Angels in heauen: vouchsafe (O my heauenly Father) to grant me all other things conuenient for mée in this life, for the onely merits, obedience, and mediation of Jesus Christ, our Mediatour and Redéemer.
            Amen.
         
         
            
            In time of affliction pray thus: yea, often.
            
               The Lord shall make the Pestilence cleaue vnto thee, vntill hee hath consumed thee: the Lord shall smite thee with a consumption, and with the feuer, and with a burning ague, &c. vntill thou repent,
               Deut. 28. 21.
            
            O Lord most iust, and Father most mercifull, thou it is that renewest thy plagues against man when hée offendeth thée: thy vengeance from heauen is both sudden and fearefull toward the rebellious and disobedient children: thou for one sinne in King Dauid, destroyedst with the loathsome disease of the Pestilence many thousands of his people: cast thine eyes of mercy vpon vs, O thou preseruer of men, which languish now in this land, and in this house, with the like disease and sicknes. Now, deare God, hath not Dauid onely offended thée, in trusting to his strength, and numbring of his people: but euen each congregation, and euery houshold hath

one way or other prouoked thee to plague thy disobedient people: & now that wée sée thy plagues appearing, to the piercing and piercing of our bodies and soules asunder: Lord, wee stand amazed in our mindes, heartily sighing with groanes at the sight of our sinnes. Now wee consider, wée haue sinned grieuously, wee haue done amisse, wee haue dealt wickedly, we haue liued vngodly, we haue iwerued from the way of truth, without any godly feare or remorse of conscience: thy great benefit of peace, and rare blessing of long prosperity, vnder so good and gracious a Gouernour, haue brought too too many of vs, to such security and contempt of Religion, that altogether forgetting to be thankefull, wée haue abused thy benefits as fast as they came, & that with a churlish kinde of impiety: the thoughts of our harts, the words of our mouths, and the workes of our hands are vaine, carnall, and diuellish: yea, our seruice to thee oftentimes but meere abomination: so farre (alas) haue we erred from the path of thy Commandements. As thou didst finde with the Israelites wickednesse in Gilgal, sinne

in Bethel, and iniquity in B
                     •
                  rsheba: so in euery Church, in euery Court, nay, in euery concourse or assembly amongst vs, thou beholdest how the flesh hath ouer-growne the spirit, and how reason is ouer-ruled with affections: so many labour in these dayes vnder the displayed Ensigne of Sathan, that very few (deare Father) are found setled in the dutifull forme of vpright and spirituall Obedience, which thou requirest. Wée confesse, thou mightest iustly therefore forsake vs, as we haue forsaken thée: and not onely procéede to sting the head-Cities, and whole body of this Land, with sundry plagues and grieuous diseases; but for our manifold sinnes and iniquities, which we daily commit, thou mightest iustly and worthily condemne vs, man after man, to eternall death, all consciences being so guilty, that they already condemne themselues. Yet who is hée (O mercifull Lord) that can measure thy goodnesse, who by thy word doest oftentimes bring sinners to beliefe, repentance, and saluation? though it be not thy pleasure (good Lord) to make the wicked innocent, but rather to visit their iniquities, yet

haue wée this comfort, that thy mercy to the humble euer rests vnmeasurable and vnmoueable: though thou spakest to the Prophet against thine own people, being disobedient to thée, saying, Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet haue I no heart to this people: Driue them away that they may goe out of my sight, some vnto death, some to the sword, and some to captiuity: yet we know (O our good God) that when as Ephraim was heard 
                  •
               amenting and praying heartily in his distresse, thou thoughtest then vpon mercy, as a Father pittying his owne children. This thy clemency to others incourageth vs to cry for thy mercies, in this our misery, vpon our repentance, both for vs, ours, and the whole Land. Uouchsafe O louing Sauiour) to represse the vehement heate of thy fire with godly pitty: stay thine hand from our destruction; thou art long suffering, good, gracious, and vnwilling sinners should perish. Be intreated therefore (O Lord) most glorious) to bid th ne Angels cease from punishing: looke forth-with vpon this Land: (good Father) pitty the infected people thereof, that wée altogether may say, The

Lord liueth for euer, worthy of praise, because hee hath béene mercifull vnto sinners.
            Amen.
            O Lord increase my Faith.

            IT pleased thée, O heauenly Father, who art Lord of life and death, once to plague the Egyptians, and yet to spare the Israelites, in the borders of Gosen; onely because thou plaguest where thou pleasest. So with the pestilence now hast thou infected, euen from Dan to Beersheba; yet my selfe, and diuers others in this place, rest safe from this so pestilent an Infection, protected and kept as yet safe therefrom, onely by thy hand, onely by thy goodnesse: for, our sinnes (we confesse) stand vp as rampired walls against vs, and deserue no lesse then theirs, whom already thou hast bruised with a iust measure of thy Judgements.

arich tranquillity, which may abound like the Streame running ouer his Bankes, and our righteousnesse as the Waues of the Sea which is neuer dry. In thee shall wee haue our wished peace, and the worke of righteousnesse shall be peace, and her fruit rest and quietnesse for euer, and thy people shall dwell in the Innes of peace, and in sure dwellings, and in safe places of comfort.
            Heare vs, O Lord of peace, and grant that thy peace which passeth all vnderstanding, may kéepe our hearts and mindes in the loue of our Lord Jesus Christ, who liueth and raigneth with thée in the vnity of the holy Spirit, now and for euermore.

            A Prayer to be vsed of a Widdow.
            
            
               Doth not the teares runne downe the Widdowes checkes? and her cry is against them that causeth them: for, from her cheekes doe they goe into heauen, and the Lord which heareth them, doth accept them,
               
                  Ecclus. 25. 15.
               Shee that is a Widdow indeede, and left alone, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day: But shee that liueth in play, is dead while shee liueth,
               1 Tim. 5. 5 6.
            
            O Eternall, and most mercifull God, which according to thine holy will hast made mée a poore distressed Widdow, by taking away my beare and louing husband out of this transitory world: vnto thée do I cry in this my misery: haue mercy on mée, I humbly beséech thée, and forgiue all mine offences, which I haue committed against thy diuine 
                  •
               aiesty: be fauourable vnto mée, O Lord, and take

pitty on mée, for I am alone and comfortlesse. Behold mine affliction and misery: relieue my wants, as thou didst relieue that Widdow of Sarepta, whom thou diddest most miraculously preserue by the Prophet Elias: take the like compassion on mée, assist mée, behold my necessity, and deliuer mée out of all troubles. Grant likewise that I may finde fauour in the sight of all Gouernours and Magistrates, that I be not iniured contrary to equity. In like manner let mée finde amongst men Christian consideration, and commiseration of my present

               state, and succour with godly counsell, protect mée from false tongues, which are like rasors, cutting deceitfully, and as the sharpe arrowes of a mighty man, Kéepe mée (O Lord) from slander, and from the tongues of wicked men, which with poysoned words haue bent themselues to cast downe the poore and néedy, and to destroy such as are of vpright conuersation. I humbly betéech thée (O Lord) to giue mée grace to liue in this mine estate of widowhood, chastly and godly, shewing my selfe an example of godlinesse to others, putting alwayes

my hope and affiance in thy mercy: let me with all patience and fortitude, indure all crosses laid vpon me, and continue faithfully in making of supplicatious night and day vnto thée. Looke how the eyes of a seruant are vpon her Mistresse, so are mine eyes bent vpon thée my Lord, vntill thou haue mercy on me. Haue mercy therefore (O Lord) on mée, for I am full of infirmity: heare me (O Father) euen for Christs sake, thy Sonne and my Sauiour: to whom be giuen all praise and honour now and euermore.

               Ecclus. 26. 1. 2. 3.
            
            O Heauenly God, euerlasting and most powerful Father, I do prostrate my selfe before the throne of thy Maiesty, humbly thanking thée, in that thou hast formed mée in the wombe of my mother, and suffered mée to be borne such as I am, maintained me likewise from mine infancy to this instant, and preserued me from infinite perils: for it is through thy goodnesse

and fatherly blessing, that I haue attained to the yéeres I am now in, and in that time, thou hast taught mee by thy holy word, to know Jesus Christ thy beloued Sonne, the onely ioy and comfort that a Christian can haue, because in the true knowledge of him consisteth eternall life; and therefore I cannot sufficiently yéelde thée praise, for the infinite and innumerable benefits thou hast bestowed on me. Neuerthelesse, because thou hast commanded vs to call vpon thée in all our necessities, and most louingly hast promised to heare vs, let it now please thée graciously to helpe me.
            For I haue found and proued, that in regard of mine owne natures corruption, I cannot continue chaste and blamelesse, except I vse the meanes which thou hast ordained, and by thy holy Word hast also approued the same, saying; To auoide whoredome, let euery man haue his wife, and euery woman her husband. Then I beséech thee in mercy to lend m

riches, or deceiuing spéeches, which may fore-runne, or procéede in this businesse: but as thy Word saith, A vertuous wife is a gift which comes from thee, O Lord▪
                and as it is most certain, that not onely thou gauest Eue to Adam, but didst likewise conioyne Abraham with Sarah, Iseac with Rebecca, and Iacob with his best estéemed Rachel; euen so I intreat and beséech thée, O Father of lights, not onely to be my Father, but also to appoint mée my fellow-partner, in regard thou oughtest to be the author and actor in so honourable a businesse. Send downe the holy Angell to be my guide and leader towards her whom thou hast prepared for mée, as (in like case) thou madest them seruants to Abraham and young Tobias. Then let mée méete her, inioy her, and liue with her in thy feare and fauour. O Lord Jesus, may it please thée with thy blessing to be with me at my marriage, as thou didst vouchsafe to honour that at Cana in Galilee, with thy owne presence.
            And as thou art well pleased to conioyne man and wife, and to make them one body, so vnite vs both vnto thée,

that we may euermore liue in thée, and thou in vs.
            Amen.
            O Lord increase our Faith.

               To auoide fornication, let euery man haue his wife, and let euery woman haue her owne husband,

            O Omnipotent, and euer-liuing God, without whom, mens enbenours are friuolous, & cannot prosper in this world, I thy poore creature, and the worke of thine hands, whom thou hast vouchsafed neuerthelesse to receiue into the fellowship of thy Saints, by the holy Sacrament of Baptisme, doe here present my selfe before thy diuine Maiesty, humbly beséeching

thée in the name of Jesus Christ, thy beloued Sonne, to stretch forth thy holy hand, and helpe mée, to the end that if it be thy will I shall marry, thou ma

               st lead and direct mée to a vertuous yoke-fellow, with whom I may liue, so long as we shall continue together, in thy loue and feare. O God, it was thou that gauest Eue to Adam, and didst addresse the seruant of Abraham to Rebecca, that she might be wife to the Patriarke Isaac.
            
            Thou didst send thine Angell with young Tobias, to deliuer Sara, the daughter of Raguel, out of the poore, desolate, and approbrious condition wherein she then liued, and to match her in marriage with the said Tobias. This is not a case of chance or Fortune, neither guided by mens wisedome, for heaping vp goods together. It often hapneth, that after one hath carefully considered all circumstances, and causes thereto belonging, searching into the vttermost as may be deuised, that party fals short of his hopes expected, and in stead of an helper, hapneth on an hinderer. I heartily therefore pray thée (O God) to prouide me such a one, as thou knowest fittest

for me, and so to order the deliberations, counsels, and enterprises of my Parents & friends, that the whole issue and euent may first redound to the aduancement of thy glory, and next to the endlesse contentment, good, and saluation of vs all in Christ Jesus, our Lord and onely Sauiour.

            O Mercifull and mighty God, the framer, wise gouernour, and gratious preseruer of all things, I render vnto thy maiesty most humble thanks, for that thou art pleased of thy gracious goodnesse, to remoue from mée the reproach of barrennesse, and hast opened my wombe to conception: prosper, O Lord, within me the worke of thine owne hands, which is wonderfully

made, whose bones and members are knowne to thée, whose very hayres thou numbrest and takest care of them. Blesse (O Lord) the worke of thme owne hand within me, that it may receiue a perfect shape and portion, and liue to praise thée in the midst of the congregation: I commend it, with my selfe, into thy holy hands, whom I beséech thée (O most gracious God) so to blesse, guide, and preserue, that neither the malice of the wicked spirit ouercome me, nor any other inconuenience approach nie mée to hurt mée: kéepe me from vame feares and foolish destres, that without danger I may beare, and with ioy bring forth the fruit where with thou hast blessed mée, to the glory of thy most holy Name, and my great comfort in thée: to whom be giuen and ascribed all honor, might, power, and praise, now and for euer.

extremity, may make mée faint, or fall from thée, or haue the least distrust of thy gracious fauour towards mée. Thou art nigh (O Lord) vnto all that call vpon thée in heart: I humbly beséech thée, not to be absent from me at my time, but that the assurance of thy presence may be my stay and comfort, that in respect thereof, I may sustaine all torments, and wholly rest in thée, which art the God of my strength and consolation: to whom be giuen all praise, now and for euer.
