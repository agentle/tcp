THE PILGRIM OF CASTEELE.
            
               VPon the ſhore of Barſelon, betweene the plankes of a Ship which had ſuffered wracke; there appeared as if it had beene a fardell of cloath couered with weedes: which being perceiued by ſome Fiſhermen, they tooke it into their Barke, and carryed it along the ſhore about the ſpace of two Miles, where vnder the ſhade of ſome Trees, they clenſed away the weeds & mud, and found that it was a man in a trance, who was almoſt paſt ſence, and without life. Theſe Fiſhers moued with compaſſion, with ſome branches cut from an olde Oake, kindled a fire, and he who had been ſo neere the looſing of his Life, now recouering it, let them know what Countriman he was, by his complaint: diſcouered his admiration by his lookes; and the feeling hee had of the good, which they had done him, by the deſire

which he had to acknowledge it. Nature doing the accuſtomable office of a pittifull mother, ſent his blood to reſtore the more infeebled parts; and hauing brought him almoſt to his former ſtrength, hee was about to haue diſcouered himſelfe: But not thinking it fit in ſo ſtrange a fortune, he concealed his birth & name: Only ſaying, that this Ship ſuffering wracke in the ſea, and ceazing of theſe plankes which the Waues had caſt vpon the ſhore▪ he was two dayes floating amongſt the billowes of the Sea, who ſometimes pittifull and then againe cruell, did bring him neare, and farther from the Land, vntill ſuch time that the refluxe of the water vanquiſhing the impetuoſitie of the tempeſt, he was caſt vpon the ſandes, where the violence of the ſtroke hauing as it were plowed vp his tombe, hee thought himſelfe buryed. His returne hee ſaid was from Italy, and the occaſion of his voyage, the indulgences of the Iubile, which was while Clement the Eight ſate Biſhop. And ſighing much, amongſt the broken ſpeeches of his ſtory, hee let them vnderſtand that he wanted a companion of his trauels, of whom there was no newes to be had, as it ſeldome hapneth that thoſe who doe free vs from bodily misfortunes, can alſo eaſe thoſe of the minde: So he reſted this day within one of their Cabens, while the colde night diſcending, all crowned with ſtarres, did impart vnto mortall Creatures reſt conformable vnto the quality of their liues, giuing deſires vnto the poore, cares vnto the rich, complaints vnto the ſad, vnto the contented ſleepe, and iealouſie vnto the amourous; In the middeſt whereof, he heard a Lyra played vpon, and according with a voyce, which in ſinging complained of a Shepherdeſſes cruelty. The Pilgrim who although hee were

weary, was yet more amorous, and loued Muſique rather then reſt, went out of his Caben into a meadow, from whence ſeeing about a dozen Houſes, and amongſt ſome Oziers, the Author of thoſe plaints, Hee called him a great way off: the other anſwered with feare, But the pale light of the Moone, which hid vnder the mantle of a Cloude, beheld the ſecrets of the night, made him ſee that it was a poore man, and without armes: hee then ſhewed him a little lower a planke lying amongſt reedes ouer a little Brooke, vnto which the ſolitarineſſe of the place, and ſilence of the night did giue no ſubiect of murmuring: which when hee had paſſed, they ſaluted one the other curteouſly, eſpecially, he which came (for ſtrangers are alwayes curteous out of neceſſity) and ſate downe together vpon the Graſſe.
            Already had the Pilgrim informed himſelfe of the name of this Village, of the Lord therof, and how farre it was diſtant from Barcelon, when they vnlooked for, ſaw two men comming who in ſtead of ſaluting them preſented two Harquebuſhes to their faces, & a thouſand feares in their hearts; The ſtranger tolde them, that they could take nothing from him but his life which hee eſteemed little, and ſixe houres agone much leſſe: the other ſaid hee was the ſonne of a Seaman betweene a Fiſherman and a Pilate, and that all his goods conſiſted in this his Inſtrument, with which hee did charme his cares. The Souldiers, did not witnes any deſire vnto their clothes, becauſe one was of Canuas, & the other of courſe cloth; And there is no Robber who is not liberall of that which is of no worth. But they

intreated them to conduct them vnto the Village, which in regard of the incertainty of the way, they could not finde in a great time. The Fiſherman tolde them that in recompence of their curteſie, hee would aduiſe them not to goe, foraſmuch as the Inhabitants were a warlike people, and did not willingly lodge men of their faſhion: And that it would be a thing impoſſible to eſcape from their hands if they were diſcouered; becauſe, that vpō the ſounding of the firſt Laram, all the other Villages wold anſwer them, from whence would come a multitude of Laborers, who with diuers Armes would ſtop the paſſages, and they knew the wayes ſo well, that there was neither Brooke, Tree, nor Rocke, which they had not at their fingers ends. To this counſell the Bandoleers replyed, that they were not alone; but that there was aboue Fifty in their troope, fighting vnder the colours of a Catalonian Knight, who had been iniured by another more mighty then hee, in meanes and Parents, although not in force, reaſon, nor courage: Hardly, had they ended theſe wordes, when by the reflection of the ſtarres, they ſawe the Armes of the ſquadron and Captaine, which they ſpoke of. And now being ioyned all together, they lodged by force in diuers houſes of this Village; The Pilgrim curious to learne (a generall inclination of all ſuch as trauaile in forraigne Countries) mingled himſelfe amongſt the Souldiers no way diſliking his company, but contrariwiſe inuited him to ſupper: after which the floore ſeruing them for Beds, they entertained one the other with diſcourſe, vntill the ſlowe morning then at the end of February, roſe out of the armes of her ſpouſe;

they knew from the Pilgrim his Fortune, and hee being deſirous to learne from them the cauſe of ſo euill an aſſured life, his feature and his vnderſtanding being very agreeable vnto them, one of them called Ramond, told it in this manner.
            
               The Hiſtory of Doricles.
               
               IN this famous Citty, which with a wonderfull greatnes oppoſeth Italy, and aſtoniſheth Africke; there was borne a Lady of noble Parentage, who hauing been a firebrand vnto her Countrey, had no ſmall conformity with the Greeke Helen: her name was Florinda, her beauty heauenly, and her ſpirit diuine▪ ſhe hauing attained vnto yeares fit for Marriage, two Knights equall in youth, greatnes of meanes, and Noblenes of blood, did ſeeke her Loue, with like hope; but vnlike fauour. Loue, naturall inclination, a ſimpathy of manners, or an influens of the ſtarres, did conſtraine Florinda to loue Doricles, and to hate Filander, who to ſhorten his way betweene hope and poſſeſſion, and to preuent his riuall, demaunded her in Marriage of her Parents, who would willingly haue kept the reſpect which they ought vnto the interceſſors and his merites, if they had not found that Florinda had loſt, when they gaue knowledge of the husband, which they propounded vnto her; They loued her tenderly and would not conſtraine her with rigor, but treating freely with Filander, they tolde him, that ſhee would not agree vnto it, although they had perſwaded her as maſters, and commaunded as Parents. Filander augmenting his loue by

the diſdaine, informed himſelfe of the cauſe, and found that the loue which Florinda bare vnto Dorricles, was cauſe of the diſdaine which ſhe bare to him, preſently did accuſe in his imagination reuenge, and a reſolution to remoue out of the world, the obſtacle of his deſigne; no whit reſpecting, the ſcandals, and the euill ſucceſſe which ſo hardy an enterpriſe might bring, hee armed himſelfe with ſuch company as hee thought good (as he who was not vnprouided of friends nor wanted ſeruants) at ſuch times as he thought hee ſhould finde Dorricles at his Miſtreſſes doore, or in the ſtreete by her houſe, who doubting of his riual
                     •
                   deſigne, alwayes went well accompanied and better armed, as hee who did not thinke that hee could haue a better friend then his Sword; And hauing cauſed a Ladder to bee brought vpon the eue of a Feaſt vnto her Garden wall, by that meanes to ſpeake with her, it hapned that Filander comming into that ſtreet, and doing his accuſtomable Office of a ſpy, heard that Florinda ſpake vnto Dorricles, and gaue him a Noſegay of Ieaſuine which ſhee had in her hand, with imbracings more inſupportable to him then fauourable vnto Dorricles: Hee charged thoſe which kept the gate, & began with them a cruell combate: Dorricles comes downe, and ſearching Filander in the middeſt of his enemies, woundeth him and puts him to flight; for a Louer fauoured, is as a gamſter who wins, who in all hazards is alwayes maſter ouer the Fortune of his aduerſary. Dorricles goeth away victorious out of the ſtreet, Filanders Loue (which he turned into diſdaine) became by this incounter a mortall hatred. Then of either ſide they increaſed their bands;

the fire of their anger kindled all their Parents; and although they euery day ſpake together as if they had no quarrell, they failed not to ſight euery night when they met. In this ſcandall Dorricles loſt the enioying of his Miſtres, Filander her fauour; ſhe her renowne, and their Parents their honour; time increaſed the Loue of the one, and the others hatred increaſed his deſire of reuenge, and of the ſmall pleaſure which the two Louers had, Filander had leſt, vnto whom it ſeemed better in this buſines to relye vpon his induſtry, for the effecting whereof his force would be wanting.
               Hauing then learned that Florinda was to take her pleaſure at Sea in a Barke, hee hid two or three dayes before, a Brigantine in a creeke not farre from the ſhore, in which he apparelled himſelfe like a Turke, with ſome other of his friends (for complices in amorous enterpriſes are ſeldome wanting) and with neceſſary Rowers attendeth his Miſtres: the Meuxin, which is the Tower where the watch of Barcelon is kept, hauing diſcouered no enemies ſayle in all the Sea. In the meane time the contented Florinda with her companions, was not gone from the ſhore a League, when as the counterfeit Frigot hoyſing ſayles, and beating the water with her owers, inueſteth her Barke, the Marriners whereof looking for nothing leſſe then ſuch a ſurpriſe, could not reſolue either to flye or to defend themſelues; But contrariwiſe (as the fearefull bird ſeeing the proude Merlin come fiercely ſtooping vpon her, is accuſtomed to attend her with couched wings) acknowledging by the Turky ſayles, the power of their enemies which were vpon them, quitted their owers; and feare (which with

a colde ſhiuering ranne through all their veynes) gaue them no time to diſcerne their ſubtilty, finally they boorded them, and two or three of the diſguiſed Turks leaping into the Barke rauiſhed away the new Hellen, who carryed into the Brigantine, ſawe herſelfe in the armes of Filander. The counterfeit wordes of theſe Pirats, who called him Amurat Raix, made thoſe who remained free in the Barke, belieue that he was the author of this robbery, And ſeeing that they tooke nothing but Florinda, they returned againe to Barcelon, recounting the diſgrace in euery ſtreet and place where they came, with more cryes and teares then wordes, which cōming to the eares of her Parents, cauſed more griefe in them then can be tolde, principally in the ſorrowfull Mother, who bewayled her loſſe with a paſſion more befitting her ſexe then a generous courage. The Gennets in vaine ſpurred vp and downe vpon the Coaſt, But Filander (who had brought Florinda into a priuate Garden houſe, hauing taken away his Turban, and his Turkiſh diſguiſe) declared vnto her, that the incomparable force of his loue, had conſtrained him to haue recourſe vnto this ſubtilty, did enioy her beauty with aſſurance, although ſhee tooke Heauen, the Trees and the Fountaines to witnes the violence which was vſed to her.
               Of no leſſe conſideration was Dorricles his paine, who full of mortall ſorrow, was a thouſand times vpon the Sea ſide ready to imitate the diſpaire of thoſe Nimphes which ſawe Europa rauiſhed; neuertheles, as well to obliege vnto him his Miſtreſſes parents, as to ſatisfie himſelfe, hee bought a Ship of an Arrogonis,
                  
which had brought in Wheate, and lading it with Silkes, Veluets and other Marchandize gaue his ſayles vnto the winde, turning his prowe toward Argiere, Sali, Morat, Fuchel, Mami, Xafer, and other Pirats, had at the ſame time arriued at Thunnis, Biſert, and Tripoly, and ſeperated their Gallies into the neighbour Ports; Doricles enquireth amongſt them of his Miſtres, and of as many others as hee knew did rob vpon the Coaſt of Spaine. But when he met with none who could tell him newes of her, whom his riuall inioyed with ſuch pleaſure, hee went to Conſtantinople, and from thence vnto Cayre, and hauing runne along the Coaſt of the Kingdomes of Fez, Morocco, Tarndan, and Tafilet, diſpairing of euer finding her, whom hee had ſo long time, and ſo vainely ſought, changed his Marchandize into Chriſtian Slaues▪ and returning into Spaine, diſimbarked at Ceute: while the deceiued Doricles did thus run along the Coaſt of Africke, a ſeruant of Filanders, were it either out of ſome diſpleaſure which hee had taken, or out of enuy vnto his happines, diſcouered all the proceeding vnto the Iuſtice of Barcelon, who in a night following inuironeth the garden houſe, with maine force, and taketh Filander then when hee leaſt looked for it; The newes and admiration, which his ſubtilty and ſurpriſe cauſed in the Citty, moued the Cittizens confuſedly to ſee him paſſe through the ſtreets; through the middeſt of whom hee was had to Priſon, and the ſorrowfull Mayd (already made a woman againſt her will) was rendered vnto her Parents; the ſentence was mortall, the opinion common, the approbation generall, and the proceſſe ſhort. The ſcaffold was ready, Filander
                  
diſpoſeth himſelfe to dye, and made it appeare, that he had the courage of a Knight, and the ſoule of a Chriſtian; Neuertheles the Viceroy, and the Biſhop, interpoſing their authority, aſſembled the Parents, and hauing mollified the neereſt, diſwaded Filanders death, in reſpecting the honour which they might gaine by his life; So of two euils chooſing the leaſt, they had more care to the reparation of their honour, then to the contentment of reuenge; Thus they changed the mourning which was already prouided for Filander, into nuptiall habits, and the ſcaffold into a bed, where Florinda was giuen him in lawfull Marriage: but the ſame day that they gaue hands with the contentment and reioycing of all the world, Doricles entred into the Citty, and vnlooked for appeared in the head of two hundred men, whom hee had drawen out of Captiuity, vpon whoſe Caſſaques did ſhine in ſiluer Brodery the Armes of Barcelon and their reſtorer; His word was I loue the King. The ſight and entry of this heroique Cittizen, was exceedingly agreeable and deare vnto the Barcelonians; But the inſupportable newes of his riuals Marriage, with his Miſtres was no ſooner come vnto Doricles his eares, but all the City in armes were diuided into factions, and contrary parties. This ſuſpended the Marriage for ſome dayes, during which time it was remonſtrated vnto Doricles, that hee could not marry with Florinda without infamy. He anſwered that what he could not haue, ought not to be giuen to Filander, it being no way reaſonable that this deceiuer ſhould gaine by fraude, what he had loſt by ſo much trauell; and there was no other meanes to accord him,

but that Florinda ſhould retire into a Monaſtery. To this her Parents contradicted already contented with the ſatisfaction of their Honour, and the aliance of their Sonne in Law, whoſe Parents offered vnto Doricles a beautifull Siſter of Filanders in marriage; But hee vnwilling thereunto, demaunded Iuſtice againſt Filander for his crime, offering, that after he ſhould bee beheaded hee would marry Florinda as widdow vnto a Knight. This laſt offer was artificially agreed vnto by Filanders and Florinda's parents, who marryed them together, and when Doricles thought that Filander had bin led vnto Priſon, & from thence vnto Death, he was giuen to vnderſtand, how hee was pardoned, and the Marriage conſummated. If his ſorrow were great it may be knowne by the effects, ſeeing it is now Twenty yeares ſince, from theſe Pirenean mountaines which diuide France from Spaine, hee hath liued as an out Lawe, robbed, pilled, and ruyned all that hee findes, neither Kingdomes being able to take any reuenge. Hee was One and twenty yeares olde when hee came from Africke, hee is now Forty one: a ſtrong man, Vigorious of his perſon, which is much fortified by his auſtere and wilde life. And that may be beleeued of him, which was ſaid of Hercules, that without doubt hee had three liues, for if he had had but one, it had bin a miracle that he had not loſt it by ſo many wounds.
               This day about Sun riſing hee came downe to ſee what noyſe this was, which the night before had ſounded from the Sea vnto the Woods, and hee with about ten of vs which followed him hauing found ſome bords which the ſea had caſt vp, vpon one of which was

ſeated a Youngman in habite of a Pilgrim like thy ſelfe, pale, in a trance, all drencht in water, his hayres full of dirt and ſand, and to conclude, euill accommodated with this tempeſt, hee commanded vs to carry him to that place where the reſt of his men were, and aſwell to dry him as to get him breath, which he had almoſt loſt, we indeauored to vncloath him, but he refuſing to bee ſeene or to be touched by vs, It made our Captaine ſuſpect that he was not a man, for although he inforced himſelf to appeare ſo, yet his actions ſhewed the cleane contrary; when as preuenting the deſire which the Captaine had to be cleared of his ſexe, this Pilgrim of whom I tell thee (taking him aſide) confeſſed that ſhe was a Woman, who came in this habit from Italy, with her husband; in which voyage, they had ſuffered Shipwracke vpon this ſhore: And in ſaying this, ſhame and deſire to defend herſelfe, brought colour into her face, and valour into her heart; with one, ſhe appeared perfectly faire, and with the other extreamly hardy: Neuertheleſſe her beauty being more powerfull to hurt others, then her forces to defend herſelfe, hath vanquiſhed Doricles his minde, who with ſweet and curteous wordes perſwaded her to reſt this day in his company, during which time her face hath neuer beene without teares. In the meane time hee commanded, after Sunſetting, that his ſupper and his bed ſhould be prouided in one of thoſe Villages, But wee inſtantly heard that ſome charge of money which was to bee carryed to Genoa, ſhould come this way, and hauing waighted for them vntill midnight, wee were without both ſupper and lodging: for this cauſe we ſent two of our companions

before, who are they which found you together with him, who conducted vs hether; Doricles hee is now with this Pilgrim; I cannot tell thee whether hee hath gained her or no, nor whether the bed had made a peace betweene two mindes ſo abſolutely differing: but certaine it is that they are now lodged together.
               The Soldiours did eaſily perceiue that the Pilgrim hearing this ſtory, bathed his face with his teares, and with ſad and violent ſighings endeauoured to pierce heauen: They deſiring the cauſe, hee remaining a long time ſilent, and they ſtill preſſing him; In the end hee began to cry out; Oh miſerable, wretch, that I am, I haue loſt my honour, my glory is deſtroyed, my hope is dead, by the hands and weaknes of a Woman. O that euer the Sea pardoned my life, ſince that with ſo much pitty, it reſerued thine, to the end that my eyes might be witneſſes (after ſo many labors and dangers) of ſuch an offence. Well did the Soldiers know that this was the man whom the Pilgrim reſpected, and the true North ſtarre vnto which ſhee turned the needle of her affection: but they endeauouring to comfort him, ſo much increaſed his fury, that drawing forth his ſword out of his Pilgrims ſtaffe, the out ſide whereof ſerued as a ſcaberd, hee ranne inraged out of this houſe vnto the houſe where the Captaine lay, and there gaue ſuch blowes vpon the doore, and ſuch loude cryes, that the Captaine thinking, he had bin aſſayled by the Iuſtice or by the Inhabitants of that place, leaped out of his bed in his ſhirt, his Piſtoll in his hand, and opening the doore asked who was there? A wretched man, anſwered the Pilgrim with an incredible fiercenes, and one

from whom thou haſt taken his honour, with this vile woman which thou doeſt poſſeſſe. Doricles diſcharged his Piſtoll and the Pilgrim turning his body, the bullet light in his arme. All the company ran thether at the noyſe, and the valiant Catalonian diſpoſed himſelfe to ſtrike quicker then the Lightning came out of thunder ſent by Ioue againſt the Giants, when as the miſerable Pilgrim woman, imbracing him with prayers, begged the Pilgrims life, ſaying vnto Doricles, that this man was hee whom ſhe did onely acknowledge for her Maſter, and on the other ſide aſſuring her deſperate Huſband that ſhe had not tranſgreſſed againſt her honour, neither in deed, word nor thought; becauſe his prayers had not vanquiſhed her, and his threats ſhould neuer. I doe not know if it ought to bee beleeued of a woman: the Hiſtory commendeth her Chaſtity, and I doe religiouſly beleeue the vertue of this ſexe ſo much eſteemed by me, and ſo greatly had in accompt all my life. Doricles would willingly that the Pilgrim ſhould haue bin contented with his life, which he would leaue him, and that hee ſhould haue gone away without the woman, But the incenſed Caſtillian defying him to a ſingle combate, began to defame him, and prouoke him in ſuch manner, that he commanded his Soldiers to hang him vp at the next Tree of the mountaine: hardly was the word out of the Captaines mouth, when the Pilgrim ſawe himſelfe carryed out of the Village by theſe barbarious fellowes, and vpon his way towards the Wood where hee ſhould be branched vp, Seeing himſelfe then at the place of execution and in the preſence of an vncuitable death, hee intreated them with teares,

that they would let him recommend his ſoule to him that was the author thereof; which being permitted vnto him, hee drew out of his boſome an Image of the bleſſed Virgin; which holding vp, with his eyes and his hands to heauen, he began his prayers deuoutly, hauing the match of one of their peeces about his necke neere vnto him, who tyed it to a bough of a great Oake, onely wayting for the end of his deuotions: Neuertheleſſe euen as hee faſtened the laſt knot, the faire morning reioycing the world with new light, cleerly diſcouered the amiable colour of his face.
               Who will beleeue that in the ſpace of one night ſo many fortunes ſhould happen to one man, if it were not knowne that things are written to bee marked, and that euils doe ſeldome come alone, ſeeing that the euils which happen in one night to one vnfortunate man, doe ſurpaſſe all the proſperity which can happen to a fortunate man in all his life? The Soldiers ſeeing the honeſt & graue countenance of this Pilgrim, his youth and his Innocency, and being otherwayes molified with his prayers; or hauing their hearts ſecretly touched by the handes of God, for hee who hardned Pharos heart can moliſie others, they reſolued to let him liue, not willing to bee more cruell then the Sea, which the day before had caſt him vpon Land from drowning; and thinking it was an infamous cruelty, that hee who had been ſpared by thinges without ſence, ſhould bee deſtroyed by them who ought to haue reaſon. The Pilgrim giueth them thankes for their liberality, and referring their reward vnto heauen, intreateth them that if by chance, this Woman which hee had left, did

perſeuer in the firmnes of her ſpeech, they ſhould tell her that ſhe ſhould finde him at Barcelon: This ſaid, he tooke his way towards the Citty, and the Soldiers towards the Village. But the fained newes of his Death which they were conſtrained to deliuer vnto Doricles, ſo much depriued the ſorowfull Pilgrim woman of ſence (whom he had before thruſt out of his Chamber, being vexed with her cryes) that ſhee remained a long time as dead, and when as ſhe was come againe vnto her ſelfe, ſhe did and ſaid ſo many pittifull thinges, that theſe fierce men moſt accuſtomed to ſhed blood, did now ſhed teares. So that the Captaine deſpairing of euer being able to pacifie her; and thinking that the beginnings of extreame griefe doe eaſily paſſe to a frenzy, commanded, that ſhe ſhould be caryed vpon the great high way; where the miſerable woman was left, drowning her ſelfe in teares, and murdering her face with her hands, ſhe made herſelfe looke with great deformity: from thence following the way by the Sea ſide ſhee went to Valence.
               
               The Pilgrim in the meane time was at Barcelon, where hauing ſtayed two dayes, to view the goodly ſtrong walles of the Citty; the third day as he was beholding the Viceroyes Pallace, this Fiſher, whoſe voyce had ſo vnhappily drawne him from the Cabens of the other Fiſhermen, and as a deceitfull Hiena had called him to bring his life into ſuch danger, knew him, and demanded of him if hee were not the Theefe, which entertained him the other night with wordes, vntill his companions came and entering by force into the houſes of the Village, had robbed them and pilled them? It is

true anſwered the Pilgrim, that I am hee who by the ſound of thy voyce came out of the Cabens of men of thy profeſſion, but not he who came with the robbers which you ſpeake of: vpon this they conteſted one againſt the other, inſomuch that the people runne to the 
                     •
                  oyſe; And as to bee purſued with hue and cry, there needs no more cauſe but to bee a ſtranger, ſo all the world beleeuing in the naturall Catalonians words, the poore Pilgrim was impetuouſly carryed away, by the people, and as a robber put into Priſon.
               The infamous rable who for crimes great or ſmall are accuſtomed to poſſeſſe theſe places, which are like ſo many true repreſentations of Hell: put him into a dark corner worſe then the worſt ſink of Conſtantinople, where it is impoſſible to recite the blowes they gaue him, and the iniuries they ſaid vnto him: becauſe hauing no mettall about him, but the Bullet, which Doricles ſhot into him the night of his misfortune, hee had not wherewith to pay his garniſh or entrance, nor ability to finde better meanes to appeaſe them.
               Night victorious ouer humane cares, impoſing reſt vnto their labours and their thoughts, and reducing their actions to a deepe ſilence came, amongſt theſe barbarous people, and the miſerable ſtranger onely not ſo much as cloſing his eyes: hee felt not the griefe of his wound, not the infamy of his impriſonment, all that which troubled him, and all that which he feared, was the Pilgrim womans looſing of her honour, which wrought ſo with him, that whilſt others ſlept in this confuſion, without that the want of beds, the importunity of many noyſome creatures, which runne vp and

downe in the Priſon, the feare of Iudgement to come, nor the preſent misfortune could wake them; our Pilgrim onely is awake, complaining againſt Heauen, the Sea, and his cruel fortune which had preſerued his life, then, when hee had no feeling of death, to make him ſuffer it now in a ſtate ſo ſenſible.
               At the length the Sunne with a countenance full of ſhame and as if he had bin conſtrained, ſhined through the thicke barres of this Priſon windowes, ſhewing in the pale colour of his beames, that hee feared he ſhould bee ſtayed there, when the pleaſant blowes of the Iaylor, and the ſweet noyſe which his Keyes made in the ſtrong lockes, awaked from their forgetfulnes, thoſe vnto whom the feare of puniſhment for their faults could worke no remembrance: But the Pilgrim was not waked, becauſe hee was not aſleepe; he came out amongſt the reſt neuertheleſſe to giue thankes to the day, for hauing paſſed ouer ſo miſerable a night. There began this miſerable body to mooue his parts, going many leagues in a little ſpace: prayers importuned ſome, care wearyed others; neceſſity called out heere, hunger ſighed there, and Liberty was wiſhed for euery where: The Lawes called vpon execution, Miniſters vpon puniſhment, and fauour importuned for delay; thoſe who had wherewith went out by the ayre, others not hauing wherewith could not finde the Doore; the confuſion of voyces, the vnquietnes of the Iudge, the comming in of ſome, the going out of others, and the noyſe of Fetters, made in this diſcording inſtrument a fearefull ſtriuing.
               In this time, a Knight; who for the noblenes of his

blood, and the antiquity of his Impriſonment, was generally reſpected as the Maſter, caſt his eyes vpon the Pilgrim, and conſidering his deepe melancholy, his habite, & his perſon, incited by his good countenance and aſpect, (for there is no letter of fauour which worketh greater effects in all neceſſities) called him to a little alley which anſwered to the doore of his Chamber, and asked his name, his Countrey, and the cauſe of his impriſonment? The Pilgrim recited vnto him the ſucceſſe which you haue heard, beginning his life, from the time that the Sea gaue it him, by caſting him vpon the ſhore not farre from the walles of Barcelon. The Knight wondred at it, and collecting from his reaſons, and the manner of his ſpeech, his vnderſtanding and his gentlenes, tooke ſuch affection vnto him, that hee placed him in his Chamber: where hauing reſtored his weake forces, with Conſerues which he had, hee made him diſcouer his Arme, and he himſelfe healed the wound with medicines and wordes, which he had learned being a Soldier; for if Herbes and ſtones haue this vertue, wherefore ſhould it be wanting to holy words?
               The contented Pilgrim afterwards turning his eyes round about the Chamber, hee ſawe written vpon the walles with a Coale according to the ancient manner of Priſoners, certaine Herogliffique verſes, at the ſight whereof, he knew that hee who had written them was not ignorant. Ouer the picture of a Young man, who had the chiefe place, was written this Verſe out of Virgill.
               
               
                  Antes ſus oios Hector triſte en Su

                     nnos.
               
               After that, was painted a Heart with winges, which

flewe after Death with the Letter of Eneas, ſending the body of his friend to his father Euander.
               
               
                  Muerto Palante;
                  Forcado en eſta vida me detengo.
               
               Neere vnto that was figured Prometheus, or Titius, who being tyed with ſtrong Chaynes to the rockes of Mount Caucaſus, nouriſhed an Eagle with his intrayles, the word was from Ouid, and ſaid thus:

                     O quanta pena es viuir, vida enoioſa y forcada
                     Y quando la muerta agrada; Ser impoſsible, mori.
                  
               
               In a flood, betweene two infernall ſhoares, Forgetfulnes was painted, being a Young man who carryed a Charger full of remembrances, which hee did endeauour to fling into the water, with this word of Lucrece:
                  
                     Buelue acaer quando al eſtremo llega.
                  
               
               The Head and Harp of Orpheus were portrayed vpon a gate amongſt the waues of the Riuer Strimo, into which hauing been caſt, by the Bachantes, they came vnto Leſbos, the word was this:

                     Aqui lloraro ſeluas, fieras et Aſpides.
                  
               
               There was alſo painted a Lady lying dead, with a Sword through her body, with this word of Scalliger vpon the Death of Polixena:
                  
                     Nobaſta, Griegos que veucais los Hombres.
                  
               
               In the diſtance which might bee betweene the window and the flower, was painted the Shepheard Argus with his hundred eyes, and Mercury charming him aſleepe, with this line of Stroſſas.
               
               
                  Amor ſutil al mas Zeloſo angana.
               
               With ſuch and other curioſities, which the Knight writ as aptly fitting his aduentures, did hee adorne his

Chamber and paſſed away his tedious impriſonment. Whileſt that the Pilgrim was buſie in beholding theſe conceipts, he was called before the Iudges to anſwere the accuſation againſt him, and hee relating ſimply the truth, by the little Art which hee brought with him in his ſpeech, he plainely ſhewed that there was no guilt in him; his cauſe being recommended vnto the Iudges by the Knight, who writ his innocency vnto them, hee was acquited & brought back againe into the Knights chamber, where they did eate together. Their diſcourſe which at the end of Dinner ſerued for their laſt diſh (amongſt other things) fell vpon their misfortunes, becauſe that there is nothing which more aptly, and readily doth eaſe the minde then relation of our owne miſaduentures. The maſter of the Lodging (who could willingly haue ſpared that name) being intreated by the Pilgrim to relate the cauſe of his impriſonment, began to ſpeake in this manner.
            
            
               The Hiſtory of Mireno.
               IN a little Towne not farre from this great Citty, there was a Gentleman named Telemaquus marryed with a faire Lady, not ſo chaſt as the Roman Lucrece although ſhee caryed her name; the report was, that this Marriage was made againſt her minde, & it is likely to be true, as by the effects it was afterwards witneſſed: her melancholy increaſed, her beauty and clothes neglected, did ſhew a languiſhment, like Roſes, when the radicall moyſture of their boughes doe decreaſe. Telemaquus did inforce himſelfe to diuert her from this

ſad kinde of neglect, leaſt it might ſeeme vnto ſome which ſhould ſee her, that this ſadnes proceeded from his default, for oftentimes innocent Husbands are accuſed for their wiues euill conditions. He apparelled her richly, carried her to ſolace and recreate her ſelfe to Sea, and to ſee the choiſeſt Gardens. And this being not ſufficient hee opened his houſe to all good company. Amongſt the young Knights which did ordinarily frequent and conuerſe with them, there was one called Mireno, ſo much my friend, that if Death had not ſet a difference between vs, I could not haue bin perſwaded (he being aliue) to diſcerne which of vs two had bin my ſelfe. This man caſt his eyes (vntill this time buſied in the conſideration of anothers beauty) vpon Telemachuſſes faire wife; who looking vpon him more earneſtly then vpon any other, had (it may bee) incited him: for although it bee ſaid that Loue can pierce as a Spirit, into the moſt cloſe and ſecret places: Yet I doe thinke it impoſſible, that any man ſhould Loue, if he bee not at the firſt obliged thereunto by ſome little hope. He concealed from me the beginning of his thought: for loue is alwayes borne diſcreet, and dumbe as a Childe. But the ſame ſweetnes of its conuerſatiō doth ſo quickly teach it to ſpeake, that like a Priſoner at the Barre he oftentimes caſteth himſelfe away by his owne tongue. So after hee ſaw himſelfe admitted in Lucrece her eyes (an euident index that he was already in her ſoule) not being able to ſuffer the glory of that whereof hee eaſily indured the paine; hee made vnto me a great diſcourſe of his Fortune, or to ſay truer, of his folly; which could not haue bin hurtfull vnto him, if hee had followed my

aduiſe aſwell as he asked it. But it is ordinary, eſpecially with thoſe who are in Loue, to aske counſell, then when as for nothing in the world they would forbeare▪ to doe that which they haue in their minde. I left no Hiſtory, either diuine, or humane, which was within my knowledge and to purpoſe, that I did not lay before him, exagerating the euils, which did proceede from like enterpriſes. But Mireno who had already firmely determined to follow his purpoſe, and thinking that I was not apt for his deſigne, by litle & litle, forbare to viſit me. Quickly did he forbeare to accompany me in walking: wee went no more by day to publicke conuerſations, nor by night to priuate; A notable error in the condition of men, whoſe loues and friendſhips are kept by flattery, and loſt by truth. I did beare Mireno's abſence with great impatience, and hee had no feeling of his liuing without me; becauſe Lucrece being now his whole ſoule, could not ſuffer that hee ſhould haue another Mireno: hauing thus ſhaken me off, communicateth his buſines with a third, who was ſo common a friend vnto vs both, that when I wanted Mireno, or Mireno wanted me, we did ſeeke one the other at his houſe: This man was not ſo conſiderate as I was, contrariwiſe there was no kinde of danger, into which he would not precipitate himſelfe to pleaſure his friend; ſuch friends are like powder in Feſtiuall dayes, which to reioyce others ſpendeth it ſelfe. This made me diſguiſe my ſelfe to follow them in the night; and one time aboue the reſt, when I had more patience, and they leſſe conſideration then ordinary, I ſawe how they ſet a Ladder to a window of a Tower, which diſcouered a ſpacious proſpect

into the Sea, ouer a Garden of Telemaquus: I ſtayed the end not to be anſwered what they did, but to ſee if I could ſerue in any ſtead in the importance of this danger, and my heart did not deceiue me, although Mireno who was within it did deceiue me. For after the firſt ſleepe, then when as with leſſe force hee vanquiſheth the cares of a maſter of a family, I heard a noyſe, and preſently I ſawe Mireno comming downe a Ladder, and Aurelio (for ſo was he called with whome he was accompanied) receiuing him in his armes, perſwaded him to flye: hardly were they out of the ſtreet, when as a ſeruant looſing the Ladder let it fall, I runne to the fall thereof, and aſwell as I could gathering it vp, ſtepped behind a corner, from whence I eſpied Telemaquus in his ſhirt, hauing his Sword naked in one hand, and a Candle in the other: and looking out at the windowe of the Tower if he could diſcerne any thing vpon the ground, of that which he had heard: I crept ſoftly to the gate; and harkening what was ſaid in this family where there was this alaram, I vnderſtood that the diſgrace of our two Louers, was taken to bee the induſtry of Robbers. In this they were not deceiued, for thoſe are no ſmal theeues, who ſteale good name & rob away honour: I returned much contented to my houſe, and ſlept but euill, in this care: The morning being come I ſent for Mireno, with whom hauing diſcourſed of diuers matters, I asked what newes of Lucrece? hee tolde me he did not ſpeake with her: For all wicked ſecrets doe for the moſt part conceale themſelues from true friends. I ſaid then vnto him, that I wondred he would diſſemble a thing ſo knowne; Telemaquus her Husband

being come vnto my houſe, to tell me that he had heard him within his; that looking out of a windowe of a Tower, he had ſeene him goe downe by a Ladder: Mireno aſtoniſhed and wondring at my relation, confeſſed vnto me what had paſſed, and how Lucrece hauing yeelded vnto his Letters, meſſages, and ſeruices had made him maſter of her liberty, yeelding vnto him the treaſure which was ſo euill kept by Telemaquus his hundred eyes. Which was the cauſe why I placed this Hiroglifique of Argus and Mercury, with this ſaying of Stroſſa:
                  
                     Subtle loue deceiueth Iealouſie.
                  
               
               Hee proceeded to tell me that when Telemaquus was aſleepe, they talked together in a Garden, into which hee entred by a Ladder made of cordes, which Aurelio kept, vnto whome onely hee had imparted this ſecret, hauing found me ſo auerſe from ſuccouring him. I asked what hee had done with the ladder? hee tolde me that from the leauing of that, proceeded Telemaquuſſes aduertiſement. The letting him ſee it, I tolde him that Telemaquus knew nothing, neither had the Ladder ſerued as an occaſion to diſcouer any thing vnto him: And letting him ſee the ſeruice which I had done him, I did begin to coniure him, that hee would in theſe terms leaue, the perilous ſucceſſe which hee ought to expect from the purſute of this deſigne, ſeeing that Telemaquus at the leaſt had notice, that his Wife was not by his ſide when there was noyſe in the Lodging: So that hee promiſed me, he would not goe any more thether, and the more to diuert him from going thether, hee reſolued to abſent himſelfe from Barcelon. I confirmed him in this reſolution; becauſe that

truely there is nothing which ſo much ecclipſeth the deſire of Louers, as an interpoſed diſtance of place betweene them; yet it was not needfull, becauſe by that time Mireno diſpoſed himſelfe to depart, Telemaquus already changed his dwelling from this Citty vnto the little place where he was marryed; And this was a memorable obſeruation, Mireno looſing the ordinary view of his Lucrece, loſt her alſo out of his thought, and confirmed his Loue better then euer to Eriſila, (ſhee was that other Lady whom I in the beginning of my diſcourſe I ſaid hee had loued) who againe loued him better and with more pleaſure then before, becauſe that Loue, which ſucceedeth after iealouſie is more violent, beſides the amiable parts which were in Mireno, who was of a goodly ſtature, of great ſpirit, and an illuſtrious blood, of a free condition, amiable both a horſbacke, and a foot, and renowned beyond all of his age, for all Military exerciſe; As for his face behold this Picture, wherein I aſſure you, the Painter was no flatterer; I keepe it heere for my comfort, although it bee alwayes preſent in my ſoule, as you may iudge by theſe wordes following:

                     Before his Eyes in a Dreame, ſad Hector did appeare.
                  
Becauſe that truely his image did neuer abandon my ſight, but either ſleeping or waking he was repreſented to my eyes: In effect we fell into our olde imwardnes; but in the midſt of this peace, the loue of Telemaquus had ſo much power ouer him, that vanquiſhed with his wiues Prayers, he brought her againe to Barcelon, where ſhe was no ſooner ſeene by Mireno, but the ancient flames of his loue, blowing away the aſhes into the

winde, diſcouered themſelues more liuely: And I fearing what might happen by this comming backe of Lucrece, perſwaded Mireno to marrie; And he himſelfe finding that it was honorableſt▪ the eaſieſt and the ſafeſt way to v
                     •…
                  inde himſelfe from theſe Loues, intreated me to find out ſome worthy ſubiect, who might ſet a bound vnto his Affections: I propounded many who I thought were of his qualitie although not of his merit; But it was with him as with thoſe who buye without pleaſure, & doe not content themſelues with any price; for ſome are too high, other too lowe: theſe blacke, thoſe pale; one leane, the other too fatt; this was too fine, an other too ſluttiſh: To be ſhort,, ſeeing he liked none of thoſe, and would not marrie, I left him, for I ſawe that Lucrece had more power with him then all they together. They then began to ſee one the other againe, for in theſe good workes, mediators are ſildome wanting: Eriſila who was paſſionatly in loue with Mtreno, began to diſcerne in him a coldenes and a careleſnes in ſeing her, & that he did diuert himſelfe by other pleaſures; She (in this ſuſpition, which may be called a true iealouſie) began to obſerue & folowe him; ſo that without ſpoyling much, ſhe knew, if not all that paſſed, at the leaſt what was the ſubiect which rauiſhed away her Mireno.
               
               Who will beleeue ſo extraordinary a conceit as I ſhall tell you? truely he onely, who doth knowe how much the ſpirit of a woman is diſpoſed (eſpecially if ſhe loue) to any kinde of induſtry and ſubtiltie: E iſila neuer leaues ſeeking occaſion that Telemaquus ſhould ſee her, vntil in the end Telemaquus did beholde her, and in

viewing Eriſila, hee ſawe in her a braue diſpoſition of a woman, who looked vpon him with faire and ſweete eyes; for when they will deceiue, they make their eyes ſnares, and their ſweetneſſes baytes: Telemaquus yeilded himſelfe (although he loued Lucrece) forced by the eyes and beauty of Eriſila, which did ſo much the more prouoke him, by how much ſhe deſired to deceiue him: he began to come to her Houſe, and ſhe to feigne a great deale of paſſion, Mireno giuing them leyſure inough, in regard he did not frequent her houſe as he was accuſtomed: Finally their affection came to the point that Eriſila deſired. Then ſhe ſaid vnto him one day (as if ſhe had not known him to be maried, which he deſembled alſo) that ſhe had ſeene him enter into one Lucrece her houſe, whereat ſhe had conceiued great iealouſie▪ 
                  Telemaquus ſmiling, began to appeaſe her ſaying, that it was without any deſigne that he had entred into this houſe (whereof indeed he was Maſter:) and as ſhe began to witnes a more feeling ſorowe, accompanied with falſe teares; he beg
                     •
                  n to remonſtrate that Lucrece was vertuous and well borne; with a great many other commendacions of her chaſtitie, and of Telemaquus her husbands care (commending himſelfe.) And ſome are of opinion, that ſelfe-commending is not vnbeſeming, when it importeth the good opinion of an other man. Eriſila then finding a good occaſion for her wicked deſigne, tolde him, that Lucrece husband might bee a gallant man, Yet neuertheleſſe, ſhe knew that Lucrece did not forbeare, to make Loue vnto a Knight of the Citty; and ſhe was afraid that ſhee might as well loue him as the other: becauſe what woman ſoeuer ſhe bee, ſhe

doth eaſily ſuffer her ſelfe to bee wonne, after the firſt lightnes: Telemaquus who began to waxe ſo pale that it was eaſie to be knowne in his face, what intereſt hee had in this diſcourſe; intreated her to diſcouer who was this Knight: But ſhee feigning to be iealouſe of him, whom ſhe did indeauour to make ſo iealouſe, inforceth her complaints, perſwading him, that ſhe was troubled with that iealouſie, which indeed ſhe had raiſed in him. To be ſhort, Eriſila vnwilling to name who it was; Telemaquus ſodainly ſtepped to her, and drawing his Dagger, ſetting it to her throat made her vtter the name of Mireno, a perſon whom he knew better then ſhee: with this Telemaquus went away, confeſſing it was true that hee had loued Lucrece, not knowing ſhe had another Louer; but now from this tiem forward he would hate her, and would ſettle all his affection vpon her, in confirmation of which, he gaue her a chaine of golde, and a Diamond.
               By this meanes, Eriſila thought that the Husband would keepe his houſe, and that Mireno (by this means barred from ſeeing Lucrece) would come to viſite her as he was accuſtomed. But the Knight, whom it concerned to wipe away this ſpot from his honour by his blood who had offended him, Seeing it was now no longer time to keepe that, which was loſt, feigning a few dayes after to goe to Montſerrat, gaue a beginning to his reuenge, and an end vnto my life. The two Louers were not ſuch ſots, nor I ſuch a foole, that wee did not thinke (although wee were ignorant of Eriſilus malice) that this abſence might be feyned; hauing had ſo many examples in the world; wherefore wee ſent our

faithfull friend Aurelio ſecretly after him. But the aduiſed Telemaquus, who knew well that he was not to deceiue fooles, went thether infallibly, whether he ſaid he would, and aſſured vs in ſuch manner, with this truth, that he deceiued vs after at his pleaſure: becauſe that another time, feyning that he went to Valence, he returned when he was halfe way, & hid himſelfe in Barcelon.
               
               Now Mireno could not ſleepe ſo aſſured with Lucrece but that I kept the Doore, although he did intreat mee not to doe it; God knoweth how many nights I paſſed without pleaſure; for my heart did alwayes tell me that their two liues did runne a dangerous Fortune. But Telemaquus the third night after entring by a ſecret doore, into the Garden (I ſpake of vnto you) without being heard or ſeene by any perſon, with onely one ſeruant with him, who carryed a Halberd, came vnto the Chamber where his ſteps were heard, and out of which Mireno came to meet him, very euill prouided of armes to defend himſelfe, not that I doubt he would not haue well defended himſelfe, halfe aſleep & naked as he was, with his Sword alone which he had in his hand: If his aduerſary, who was accommodated with more aduantageable armes, had not ouerthrowne him dead to the ground with a Harquebuſh ſhot: the report of the peece, made mee iudge that ſuch a ſalutation at that time of the night, was rather a condemnation, then any thing elſe: wherefore indeauouring to breake open the doores, I waked the neighbors, ſome of whom running thether with their armes, and hauing helped me to ouerthrow the doores, wee entred in. Already had Telemaquus, broke into his Caben, where Lucrece was hid,

and dragging her from thence, not farre from the place where Mireno lay, hee thruſt his ſword into her, ſo that when we came, her breath went away with the laſt Ieſus. And ſeeing that he had killed Mireno, me thought Scaligers verſe, which is vnder this picture was not vnapt:

                     Was it not enough to kill and vanquiſh men?
                  
               
               I had not as yet ſeene Mireno, and ſearching him with mine eyes all about the roome, I ſawe him lying Dead: thou mayſt ſee in the teares which now flowe from my eyes, what was then my griefe, I doe not know what I did, yet ſeeking for Telemaquus, I did excuſe him for the care of defending himſelfe; and from iuſtifying ſo bloody an execution: For hauing met face to face, I thruſt at him, with which thruſt, he accompanied their two liues, which he had extinguiſhed. By this time the houſe was beſet, by thoſe whome the Iuſtice had raiſed, who apprehended as many as they found, and me eſpecially, for hauing killed Telemaquus without cauſe, although according to the Lawes of the world there was but too much cauſe, and heere they put me where thou now ſeeſt me, & where I haue liued this fiue yeares, deſiring Death, as thou mayſt ſee by this winged Heart of mine flying after this Image of dead Mireno; with this word out of Virgill:
                  
                     My Palas dead, I bide aliue by force.
                  
               
               My trauels are figured in thoſe of Siciphus, and Titius, and repreſented by theſe wordes out of Ouid:
               
               
                  O wretched ſtate, conſtrain'd to liue
                  In plaints eternally:
                  When Death which onely helpe can giue,
                  Affords no power to dye.
               
               
                  
The ſorrowe which this great Citty felt by the loſſe of Mireno, is expreſſed in this figure of the Head and heart of Orpheus, with this word:

                     There wept the Woods, the Beaſts, and Snakes.
                  
For I doe not thinke that there was either tree or ſtone which were not mooued with this ſo pitifull an accident. And here will I end his Story, with theſe teares which I will offer inceſſantly to his memory, and theſe wordes which I haue made for Lucrece her Tombe.
               Here lyeth Lucrece, leſſe chaſte then the Roman, but more faire: Tarquin did not force her, but loue; and although ſhe dyed for her infidelitie, Loue, who was the cauſe, is of power to excuſe her.
               So the faire Lucrece remayned in mortall reſt, & her name, in my imagination, not worthy of blame: for hauing bene ouercome by the excellent parts of her Louer, and by that vnchangeable force which Loue euer vſeth againſt great and free courages.
               The Pilgrims impriſonment had not paſſed at ſo eaſie a rate of his pacience, had not Euerard (ſo was the Knight called that made this Diſcourſe) fauoured his affaires: for his innocencie could not gaine him his libertiye, nor good opinion, which he did deſerue; ſo powerfull was his onely habit, to worke in the Iudges an euill conceit of his perſon; Yet Doricles (Captaine of thoſe Robbers) being pardoned, and receiued again into the Cities fauour; the Pilgrim was alſo abſolued, as his Confederates.
               His curioſitie to heare the Fiſher-mans ſinging, hauing brought him to receiue a hurt in his Arme with a Piece, into an extreme danger of hanging, vnto the 3.

monthes impriſonment, which without the help of Euerard had bene inſupportable. They take their leaues one of an other, with a thouſand louing imbracings, and Euerard hauing further obliged him with ſome money, hee reſolued to goe to Mountſerrat, and I to finiſh this Firſt Booke.
               The end of the Firſt Booke.
            
         
         
            The Second Booke.
            
               BY a ſtraight way, between thicke Trees and ſhady did the Pilgrim goe towards Mountſerrat, who turning his head at a noyſe which hee heard behinde at his backe, hee ſawe two young-men with Palmers ſtaues, whoſe faire faces, and white hayre made them ſhew to bee either Germans or Flemmings, He ſaluted them, and ioyfull of ſo good company, he impoſed ſilence vnto a thouſand ſad thoughts, which ſolitarines had brought into his memory; And trauelling together, they began to diſcourſe of diuers matters, with which they eaſily and with pleaſure paſſed away the craggy, and vneuen way of the mountaine, vntill they came vnto a Fountaine, which bubling into a valley, made a gentle harmony; So that as it were inuited by the ſweet noyſe, and the freſh ſhade, they ſate downe vpon the ruſhes

which grew by the Brooke ſide, and admiring the ſweet complaints of the Nightingale; one of the Almans, which ſhewed a good nature imbelliſhed with Learning, began to diſcourſe of Filomelas loue, ſaying that now ſhe wold recompence with her infinit notes, all the time that ſhe had bin dumbe after Terreus had cut out her tongue. The Spaniard, replyed that Martiall, had vttered the ſame conceit, & the Alman reioycing to finde in him more capacity then in common perſons (for it is an inſupportable labour to trauell with an ignorant man) riſe from the place where he ſate, and imbracing him with a great deale of contentment, after many other diſcourſes, Let vs goe, ſaid hee, adore the bleſſed Virgin. In this Image ſo much renowned, through all the world, wee cannot make a more holy voyage, nor I in better company then thine: let vs goe ſaid the Spaniard by this pathe, which ſeemeth to me to bee much the ſhorter, although a little ſteeper, for the moſt part of the way.
            This being ſaid, they tooke their way towards the Temple, which they diſcouered ſhortly after, built vpon the ſide of a ſharpe Mountaine, and vnder a great Rocke, which did ſeeme to threaten it with ruyne.
            When they were entred, with deuotion & humility, caſting their eyes into this Tapeſtry of France, Almane, and almoſt all the world: they were aſtoniſhed, to ſee the walls decked with ſo many excellent Paintings, Hiſtories, & accompanied with a thouſand ſeuerall kinds of offerings, which with an admirable correſpondency did ſtirre vp and aſtoniſh the ſences altogether. There did they power forth their prayers and their teares, and

after they had ſeene, and beene informed of all that was conſiderable, in this Monaſtery, the day hauing loſt her beauty, by the Sunnes abſence; they retired altogether vntill the morning ſhining through the Eaſterne gates gaue them knowledge of the new dayes approch. Then they reſolued to viſit the diuers habitations of the Hermits, which liued in theſe Mountaines, & being come vnto the ſeuenth Hermitage, they found a young man of an agreable countenance, and a goodly preſence, whoſe long and well combed hayre, gaue a reuerent maieſty vnto his aſpect. This man ſtayed them dinner, and after their repaſt, being intreated by the Pilgrims to tell them what deuotion had confined him into theſe ſolitary mountaines; hee related the hiſtory of his life, in this manner.
            
               The Hiſtory of Aurelia.
               
               AMongſt all the thinges, which in the courſe of my life I haue ſeene and marked, I might peraduenture tell you ſome one, which might better content you. But thinking that one cannot better perſwade, then by the example of himſelfe; I will therefore tell you a ſtory which is drawen from my youth, and from the Twentith yeare of my age, written by my miſfortune, and imprinted in my memory, ſeeing that the renuing can doe me no damage, and may bring you profit. This ſhort tyrannie, the bayte of youth, the illuſion of the ſight, the priſon of the ſoule, and the darkner of the ſence, which is called Beauty, and which heauen ſeemeth to giue Women for our miſchiefe: blinded

ſo my eyes at the firſt knowledge, which they had in the world, that my ſpirit did not liue ſo much in my ſelfe, as in her whom I loued, nor found more reſt out of her ſight, then thinges doe out of their centure; becauſe that as the fire alwayes ſendeth the flames thereof to its proper ſphaere, ſo my heart adreſſed his deſires to her beauty.
               Now as this Loue was not Platoniqe. I will not diſpute whether it were honeſt, profitable, or delightfull; Let it ſatisfie, that it, which is the cauſe of ſo much euil, ſeemed vnto me, the greateſt and ſoueraigneſt good in the world. This ſubiect of my misfortunes, was called Aurelia, free in her cuſtomes, of that kinde of life, which Plautus & Terence deſcribe in their Fables; and of whom Auulus ſaith excellently well; That a Curtezan is a veſſell full of holes, which can containe nothing. She was faire in all perfection, of a quicke and hardy ſpirit, and of a reaſonable good nature, a woman (to be ſhort) vnto whom experience in the worlde had brought a great deale of knowledge. It coſt me little to poſſeſſe her, becauſe that theſe kinde of women (cleane contrary vnto other women, who forced by the Loue of a man, doe honeſtly yeild vnto his merits) truſting to their charms and vnto the gentlenes of vſage, paſſionate men more when they are inioyed, then when they are pretended. I was not vexed at the firſt, with the conuerſation of young men, who at any hower how extraordinary ſoeuer, were neuer wanting in her houſe, becauſe the fauours which ſhe did me, and the little which they coſt me, made me liue much contented, eſpecially ſeeing my ſelfe preferred before others, of better meanes and

merits then my ſelfe; when I went to ſee her, they gaue me place, and departed curteouſly, leauing me alone with her.
               Theſe my viſitations were not agreable vnto her ſeruants, becauſe they thought, that thereby, this rable of youth was ſcattered, which brought them profit. And that if Aurelia ſhould fall in Loue with me; my quality being not capable to ſuſtaine her expence, ſhee muſt ſpend out of her owne meanes, from whence would vneuitably follow a neceſſity of liuing more regularly, which they would by no meanes heare of; And of this were they not much deceiued, for in a ſmall time Aurelia, who had rauiſhed ſo many others, was taken her ſelfe in my loue, and made captiue to my will, which made true one part of this feare, and ſhortned the reuenues of her houſe, to lengthen the reynes of her pleaſure. Not that all the charge of the houſe, fell vpon her; for I miſerable man, tormenting my Parents, and importuning my friends, did runne to the preſeruation of this loue, which almoſt alwayes depended of mony.
               The life which wee led (wee louing one another tenderly, and hauing in our power the liberty of inioying) may eaſily bee iudged by my youth, and by Aurelia▪s, who was then about 20. yeares olde. The houſe ſeemed too ſtraight for our Loue, and ſearching ſolitary fields, we made the ſight of open heauen witnes of our folies, our life was a blind imitatiō of the nature of Beaſts, we communicated our ſecrets to Trees, which did not ſee, as if the leaues had not beene ſo many cleare eyes, and a thouſand amorous delights to the dumbe Fountaines, which might well haue troubled the purity of their

waters, I cannot thinke how in ſo little a way as there was between my houſe, & hers. I remained 5 yeres ſpace before I knew that I was arriued there, being certaine, that in 3. yeares ſpace of that time, the famous Engliſh Drake paſſed the ſtraight of Magellan, & compaſſed the world about. If in all this time, the loyalty which ſhee ſwore vnto me, were broken or no, I am not able to ſay, nor yet forbeare to beleeue, becauſe it ſeemes almoſt a thing vnpoſſible, for ſuch women from their cuſtome, to keepe themſelues to an orderly life.
               At the end of theſe fiue yeares, I ſaw my ſelfe at the end of my meanes, and although I was more amorous then in the beginning, yet Aurelia did ſuffer herſelfe to be vanquiſhed by the obligations of another, who had more power, then my ſeruices: I ſay obligations, becauſe I cannot beleeue, that onely Loue can binde one vnto ſo ſtrange a change. One night Aurelia hauing ſeene me retire my ſelfe vnto my bed, ſhee had receiued Feliciano into hers (ſo was the Knight called.) I ſtirred with a profound Iealouſie, riſe vp out of my bed, and went to her houſe, where the doore was ſhut againſt me: and the ſeruants anſwered mee from aboue out at an high windowe, feyning that they were gone to bed, to make me rather to retire vnto my owne houſe. But my extreame loue which would not at that time, haue relyed vpon my eyes, and feared to be betrayed by my thoughts: made me cry aloude, that ſome body ſhould open the doore, ſo that my voyce came vnto Aurelia's eares. And Feliciano making ſhew of a valiant-Louer, began to cloth himſelf, promiſing to chaſtice my boldnes with his Sword, and by his onely preſence to cure

my folly; But the cunning Circe, who knew well what good or bad ſucceſſe ſoeuer came vnto mee, it would redound vnto her ſhame; hindred him with her armes, and diuerted him with her teares, although there was no great neede: For the braueſt doe vnwillingly arme themſelues, when they are once naked; and to come out of a houſe into the ſtreet, had beene a manifeſt and mad raſhnes.
               
                  Aurelia ſo preuailing, in that manner, wherein others of her kinde are wont to preuaile; and making Feliciano beleeue, that I ſhould be her husband, and that if I did perceiue him, ſhee ſhould looſe me; perſwaded him halfe vnclothed, and in the midſt of Ianuary, that hee would goe into the higheſt roofe of the houſe. Into which he being gone, I was let into the houſe, where I found Aurelia in bed making ſo many complaints of my liberty, and of the ſcandall which I gaue the neighbors, that in ſtead of being angry, it behoued me to appeaſe her, where (after ſome time ſpent) ſhe in complaining of me, and I in asking pardon for my iealouſie, and for the deſire which I had to ſurpriſe her in that infidelity which I did diſtruſt: I poſſeſt the abſent mans place, which was ſtill warme, ſeruing for a proofe of my ignorance and blockiſhnes.
               Morning brought againe the Sunne, and the Sun the Day, yet neither of them was ſufficient to make me ſee my folly (ſo euill doth a Louer diſcerne of his owne acts) I riſe contented, and although I entred laſt, yet I went ſooner away then Feliciano.
               
               In the meane time Menander who had for the ſpace of ſome yeares, been Feliciano's Miſtris, grew extreamly

iealous, and hearing of this trick, which Aurelia had put vpon him, could not forbeare ſpeaking of it, mocking him with the colde night which he had indured, & that hee had ſuffered me, who neuer had any intent to marry her, to poſſeſſe that place by her ſide which he had loſt: Feliciano aſſured her, that Aurelia (preferring his Loue, before the obligations, wherein for ſo many yeares ſhe was bound vnto me) did rather abuſe me then him; and that whenſoeuer ſhee or any other, would afford him the like curteſie, hee would willingly ſuffer one euill night, to haue ſo many good: and for proofe of what he ſaid, he gaue her a key, wherof I was wont to be maſter, which I was made beleeue was loſt. Menander diſſembled her thoughts, but ſo ſoone as ſhee met me againe, ſhee tolde me all the circumſtances, and with all gaue me the Key; hauing which, I needed no other witneſſes of the truth, nor other inſtrument to open the doore. I then reſolued to reuenge my ſelfe of Aurelia in leauing her, and of Feliciano, in ſeruing Menander, from whoſe Loue I preſumed he had not freed himſelfe, and if hee had bin free, yet I knew he muſt needs be grieued, that I ſhould inioy her whom hee loued in euery bodyes opinion. I found Menander willingly diſpoſed, for our thoughts were alike, and our iniury alike, and we might well ſerue to reuenge one the other; She then feyned to loue me, and I payed her in the like counterfeiting. Aurelia was aduertiſed, and grew deſperate, and Feliciano no leſſe intaged, ſought me to kill me. Behold how iealouſies and neglects doe diſcouer the truthes, which are in the centure of hearts.
               
                  Aurelia found me ſooner then Feliciano did, as ſhee

who therein hazerded leaſt: and ſtaying me began in fury and in threatnings, yet ended in prayers and in teares: But vpon ſo freſh an iniury, I was rather confirmed in my neglect (ſeeing her yeeld vnto my loue) then any way moued with her paſſion. Finally, hauing changed my firſt affection into hatred, (alwayes inſupportable to a woman who hath beene well beloued) Aurelia began to purſue me, and although that the Citty of my birth and abode, doth not yeeld for greatnes, to aboue two or three in all Spaine, yet could not I find any lodging wherein ſhe did not clamor me, any friend whom ſhe did not reuolt from mee, any ſecret which ſhe did not publiſh, nor any danger whereinto ſhe did not endeauour to throwe me; So that oppreſſed with theſe purſuits, and ſeeing my ſelfe reduced to the contenting her, after a thouſand contrary deliberations, I reſolued to take vpon me a religious habite, and to preuaile by his protection, in whoſe hands and feete God hath imprinted the markes of our reperation. St. Fran.
               
               But O theſupreme force of a diſpiſed Loue, from the holy Quire of the Temple, from the middeſt of the Alters, and Images of the Saints, the teares of Aurelia drew me againe; And then I followed her, with more liberty and leſſe ſhame then before, leauing the habite whereof I was not worthy, and neglecting the ſpirituall treaſure, which I did then inioy, to follow the infamous life which I had formerly led, ſo much power hath the capitall enemy of our ſoules. Our loue began freſher then euer, with the generall ſcandall of thoſe who knew vs, the hatred of our Parents, and the deteſtation of all our friends, which within a ſmall time brought mee to

ſuch tearmes, that I thought ſorrow would haue killed me. The infamy wherein wee liued and the feare of Iuſtice did oblige vs, to depart the Citty, and feiling that ſmall remainder of goods which wee had left, laden with a number of euils, wee paſſed into Italy; from whence, I went (for ſome time) to ſerue the Catholike King in Flaunders, and the Duke of Sauoy in Piemont, returning alwayes to Naples where I had left her. The laſt time I put to Sea with her in my company, (intending after the Flaunders warres, to returne into Spaine) where in a violent tempeſt, (which heauen for the quiet of our ſoules) ſent vs in the gulph of Narbone; in the laſt point of life, and when we were paſt hope of ſcaping, we vowed our ſelues to a Religious life, with ſuch earneſtnes of teares, that afterwards the ſtorme ceaſing and wee landing, ſhee entred into the Monaſtery of the Conception; and I vnderwent this habite wherein you now ſee me, where after ſome yeares of approbation this Cell was giuen me.
               Heere Tirſis the Hermit of this happy abode ſtayd his diſcourſe, & our Pilgrims iudging that it was too late to paſſe further, being to deſcend neceſſarily into the Lodging, which within this holy Houſe is giuen freely to ſtrangers; they went vnto the Monaſtery, diſcourſing vpon the Hermits relation, determining the next day to goe to the vttermoſt hermitage, which vnder the title of St. Ierome, crowneth the head of the Mountaine.
               But the misfortunes of our Pilgrim, which had ſlept for ſome time, began to wake with more violence; for in the houſe where theſe ſtrangers had lodged, there was wanting ſome Iewels, with a Mayd ſeruant of the

houſe, and the Almains amongſt others, were purſued by the Iuſtice, although innocent, becauſe it was affirmed by ſome, that this ſeruant inamored of their beauties, had runne away with them.
               All Nations haue their Epithites, which being once receiued by the world can neuer be loſt. The Scithians are called cruell, The Italians religious, The French noble, The Dutch induſtrious, The Perſians faithleſſe, The Turkes laſciuious, The Parthians curious, The Burgundians fierce, The Britaines hardy, The Egiptians valiant, The Loraines gentle, The Spaniards arrogant, and the Almains beautifull. And this was the cauſe for which it was thought, the Mayd being ſeduced by them had run away with them.
               Now the Almains were eaſily taken, but the Pilgrim deſperate through his late long impriſonment, which hee had ſuffered in Barcelon, and out of the little iuſtice which he as a ſtranger could expect, ſeeing them come vnto him, ſtood vpon his defence, and floriſhing his Palmers ſtaffe, (with which he was very skilfull) leſt two of them lying vpon the ground wounded, and vertuouſly freed himſelfe from the hands of the others, who remained aſtoniſhed at his valour.
               Betweene Tortoſe and Caſtillon, there ſtretcheth forth a great hill, wherewith the Sea of that coſt is bounded, alongſt the the coſt of the vale of Sago and of the Kingdome of Valence: where the Moores of Argiere doe land out of their Gallyes, when they are not perceiued by the watch, and hiding themſelues amongſt the hollow places of theſe hilles, doe rob not onely the Fiſhermen, but all ſuch as paſſe that way. And ſometime when they

are many of them together, they doe rob away whole Villages together; in this vale, they being guided by Renegados, and thoſe betrayed againe by the Moores: There one darke night did the Pilgrim lye (weary with his iourney which he had taken out of the way) obliged thereunto by the feare which he had of purſuite. And being aſleepe after many long and grieuous imaginations of his loſt happines, which he did beleeue to bee ſtill in the hands of Doricles, as the roaring of the Sea (the waues whereof breaking againſt the rockes make a horrible noyſe) awaked him. He heard neare vnto him the voyce of ſome Moores, who hauing ioyfully ſupped vpon the Land, were talking of their Robberies. Hee who ſleeping vpon the ground in the field, at his wakiug, findeth himſelfe neere vnto a venomous Snake, doth not ſo ſoone looſe his colour, as doth our fearefull Pilgrim, hearing the Moores ſo neare him, whoſe handes he did thinke it impoſſible to ſcape; Yet relying vpon his iudgement in a matter wherein hee thought his force would not preuaile, ſtole from them by gentle ſliding vpon the ground, making his hands performe the office of his feete vntill hee had attained the top of the hill, where finding that the Moores had heard him, hee began to cry with a loude voyce; Heere valiant Knights heere, this is our day: behold the Moores before you, and as a pray in your hands, whom you haue with ſuch paines and diligence endeauored to ouertake: Hardly had he couragiouſly vttered theſe words, when as the Moores, (like Frogs who at the noyſe of paſſengers leape from the bancke ſides, into the quiet waters of the Lakes) ran with all the ſpeed they could

to the Sea to get aboard their Boate, with which they eaſily got to their Galley.
               Full of admiration was the Pilgrim, to ſee how happily his reſolution had ſucceded, when from a Tree which was neere vnto him he heard a voyce, which ſaid: Ah Knight helpe me for the mother of Gods ſake. His valiant courage which was neuer aſtoniſhed with any kinde of danger or misfortune, guided by the voyce vnto the tree, where he had heard him, ſawe a man tyed thereunto, of whom hauing asked his name, hee was anſwered, that he was a Catalonian Knight, whome the Moores (after they had killed two of his ſeruants) had taken vpon the poaſt way of Valence. The Pilgrim hauing vnbound him, and both of them departing from the Sea, tooke their way to Almenare, and through the Valley beautified with Orenge trees, trauelled towards Faura. Already had the morning ſtrewed pearles vpon Flowers, who putting their heades foorth of the boughes, did ſeeme to ſalute the day, when both the diſcourſe, and face of the Knight, did ſhew vnto the Pilgrim that this was Euerard, he who (when he was priſoner at Barcelon) had obliged the Pilgrim for his liberty; both their ioyes, their imbracings, & their teares, were as admirable, as the ſucceſſe which you haue heard: Frō whence is collected, how agreable vnto Heauen is the good which is done vnto ſtrangers; ſignified by the ancient Philoſopher in Denoalion & Pirra, who for hauing Lodged Iupiter, were made reſtorers of the world; and contrarily, Diomedes deuouring his gueſts with his Horſes, hee was in the end himſelfe deuoured by them.
               The Pilgrim demaunded of Euerard how hee had

gotten his liberty, and hee told him that with the helpe of ſome friends, he had broken Priſon, and ſcaped away by the poſt of Barcelon; from whence hee might well haue gone for Italy, but being vnwilling to bee a run-away from his owne Countrey, he was reſolued, to goe to the Court, to haue his cauſe iudged, whether he was going with that intention, when hee fell into this Ambuſcado of the Moores. He then demaunded of him, if he knew Doricles? and being anſwered that hee was his kinſman, the Pilgrim ſighed many times, without telling the cauſe, although he were much importuned by Euerard, vnto whom he onely ſaid, he had a young Brother in his company who had quited him to follow Doricles; Euerard who vnderſtood ſomthing of the ſecrets, (ſuſpecting that this was ſome Woman, who had been ſtollen away by the robbers vpon the ſhore of Barcelon) aſſured him that hee knew all the ſeruants which Doricles had in his houſe, and that there was not one Caſtelian amongſt them.
               In ſuch and like wordes, which drew infinite ſighes and teares from the Pilgrim, they arriued at the auncient Moruiedro, (where at this day are remaining, the moſt famous workes of the Roman greatnes, of any that are in Spaine) and from thence they went to the City of Valence, entring by the royall Bridge Turio, which riuer the Moores call Gandalabiar: and paſſing by the famous Tower of Serranos, they lodged at a Knights houſe, who was friend vnto Euerard, and of the Family of the Mercaderos. There they remained this night, finiſhing the relation of their fortunes, vntill the Sunne riſing called them from their reſt, eſpecially Euerard, who carryed

with a ſtrong deſire of finiſhing his intended iourney, departed with griefe from the company of the Pilgrim, whome he left no leſſe ſorowfull, in this flouriſhing Citty.
               There he ſpent a fewe dayes in beholding the proud buildings wherewith it was imbeliſhed: and in the end he viſited the Hoſpital where mad folkes are with more care and conueniencie looked vnto and kept, then in any Citie in all Spayne: There beholding the ſeueral humours of theſe miſerable people, he (I ſay) who lately was likely to haue loſt his owne wittes, ſawe amongſt thoſe who were leaſt mad, ſit downe at the Table, (at which they did altogether eate) a young Foole & very beautifull, whoſe flaxen haire was longer then men doe ordinarily weare in Spayne; All the blood in this Pilgrims body came into his face, and went ſodainly back againe, out of the remembrance which this mad creature brought vnto him of his Miſtris, whome he could not well knowe, aſwell becauſe he could not comprehend in his minde, by what meanes ſhe had bene reduced to this diſtraction; and leſſe, how to this place, as alſo through her euill vſage in that place, & her ſicknes, ſhe did differ from the Idea which he had of her countenance in his minde. Neuertheles, as ſhe beheld him with her eyes full of admiration, he was confirmed in his firſt thought, and letting fall ſome teares, he ſaid vnto her in a lowe voyce (leaſt the Keeper who had brought them to the Table ſhould hear them) do ye know me? to whom this woman (neuer known to be ſo in that place) who had ſeene him caryed vnto the Oakes of the mountaine, where Captaine Doricles had commaunded

his Soldiers to hang him, for whoſe death ſhe had ſhed ſo many teares, and ſighed out ſo many complaintes, that the violence of her griefe had troubled her vnderſtanding; and yet alſo doubting of his life, though ſhe did ſee him; tremblingly anſwered, that ſhe was wont to knowe him: Already was this Pilgrim, by the voyce, by the fearfulnes, and by the teares aſſured, that this mad body was the maſter of all his wittes; and fearing leaſt he might make ſome demonſtration of his inward griefe, whereunto by the ſight of this ſo great miſfortune he was obliged; he demanded ſoftly of her, how and by what meanes ſhe was come vnto this miſerable eſtate? The griefe I tooke (anſwered ſhe) thinking vpon your death, ſo ſoone as the Captain had commaunded that you ſhould be hanged, not without hauing offended me, replyed the Pilgrim, a thing which I neuer expected from your conſtancy, although farre greater occaſion had bene offered. The looſing of my honour (ſaid ſhe) muſt be out of theſe two reſpects, either of force or for pleaſure: if out of pleaſure, I had now no cauſe to bewaile my ſelfe; nor if it were by force meanes to bring remedy, and leſſe meanes had I in looſing of my wittes; And that it is true, that the very thought I had of your death was the cauſe of my madnes, let this ſatisfie you, to ſee that I recouer them, in hauing you aliue. Faire Niſa anſwered the Pilgrim, am not I a miſerable man, in hauing bene the cauſe of ſo much euill by my misfortunes? There is nothing deere Pamfilus (replyed Niſa in weeping) deſerues this name that hath bene ſuffered for your occaſion, and for ſo cruell a feeling as the report of your death brought

to me; And if I were permitted to imbrace you heere according vnto my deſire, the recompence would be as great as the trauels, which I doe bewayle onely, in regard they were no more, ſince that, according to their multitude, they would augment the glory of my ſuffering. It was not in vaine, anſwered Pamphilus, (for the Hiſtory names him from hence forward) that my hope made me deſire to liue, onely that I might ſee you, for I was aſſured that in the glory of beholding you, all iealouſie would be wiped away, that might any way allay my ioy. And if the eyes of thoſe who looke vpon vs, did not better ſee, then their vnderſtandings doe know, you ſhould before this haue found, that your deſire of imbracing was moſt agreable vnto me. To this ſaid Niſa (whoſe name hitherto wee haue hid) as alſo Pamphilus his, becauſe that trauailing in this habit amongſt ſo many dangers, (I durſt not tell their Country nor their name) I will make my paſſion ſerue as a remedy. What paſſion anſwered Pamphilus. Euery time ſaid ſhee when my griefe depriues me of my reaſon, they tell me that I cry aloude, thoſe wordes which I will now ſay to thee, in imbracing thee. And then ſhe ſaid theſe wordes; O my ſpouſe, is it poſſible that my eyes doe behold thee? Is it not thou, who dyed in the mountaines of Barcelon, by the euill hands of Doricles barbarous Soldiers? bleſſed bee the houre wherein I ſee the newes is falſe. In ſpeaking this, Niſa fell about Pamphilus his necke, amorouſly imbracing him, whoſe vnſpeakable pleaſure was onely interrupted, by the preſence of the aſſiſtants.
               When the man who had the charge of appeaſing the mad ſolkes fury, ſawe this deportment in Niſa, hee began

to giue her rude words, and more ſharpe blowes. Let him alone ſaid Pamphilus, for I am his Countriman and his wiues kinſman, and doe not wonder that this ſight of me, doth cauſe in him this ſortowe. Whatſoeuer you are, anſwered this barbarous fellow, it skils not, heere is neither complements nor viſitations: And the token of this mans mad fit in comming vpon him, is to call his Husband, with ſuch or the like wordes. But if I pacifie this his mad fit ſaid Pamphilus, to what eud doth your chaſticement ſerue? And how will you appeaſe it ſaid the other, Is not this an euident token of his madnes, that he cals you his ſpouſe, and takes you for a woman? You are ignorant of his humour, and of the trouble he giues vs, although he doe not appeare to be aboue Nineteene yeare of age; I know all this well, anſwered Pamphilus. Neuertheles let me ſpeake to him, for I do aſſure you that my ſelfe alone can appeaſe him; and as it is a good worke, from any body who hath a ſicknes to take away the paine, for ſome time, though it returne againe; So in madnes, it is a good worke, to bring to paſſe, that hee who hath loſt his wits ſhould recouer them againe though it were but for one houre.
               Yet neither this reaſon, nor many other, ſerued him to any purpoſe, for the officers had already put manacles vpon Niſa's hands; and the maſter, did rigorouſly pull her to the Cage, although ſhe had no neede of this remedy, nor any other, but the ſight of Pamphilus. But as thoſe who are accuſtomed to lye, are ſeldome beleeued, although they ſay the truth: So in him who is mad, it is accounted a token of greater madnes, to ſeeme wiſe. Thus Niſa was had away to ſtraight impriſonment, and

                  Pamphilus ſtanding aſhamed, fearing that euory one knew, what was priuy only to himſelfe, beheld her with abundance of teares; A thouſand times hee was about to let goe the reynes of his paſſion, which his vnderſtanding held in, and to bee mad in reaſon, beleeuing that if hee were mad, the chaſtiſement of his madnes, ſhould be to remaine with Niſa, which was the greateſt good he could hope for. And to begin his deſigne, he offered (againſt the Lawes of this houſe) to breake the gates of the Priſon, and ſee her by force: but hardly had hee made any demonſtration thereof, whenas the Porters with the mad ſeruitors, (ſuch as hauing recouered their wits, do ſerue the others) fell vpon him, & beating him cruelly, flung him into the ſtreet, where (as the Fiſh whereof Ariſtotle ſpeakes, which being drawne out of the water, frameth a humane voyce & dyeth) he fetch'd a great figh and fell vpon the ground aſtoniſhed.
               The Sunne was declined lowe toward the Weſt, couering with gold and purple that part of the Horizon, when Pamphilus returning out of his aſtoniſhment, found himſelfe in the armes of a young man, who hauing compaſſion of his griefe, incouraged him to recouer life. Pamphilus looking ſtedfaſtly vpon him, with heauy ſadnes, demanded where he was? the young man tolde him, that hee was at the doore of the Hoſpitall, where the mad folkes were kept. And how is it, replyed Pamphilus, that I am not within? becauſe (ſaid the other) thou appeareſt, to be more diſeaſed in body then in the paſſions of thy minde: Thou iudgeſt by the countenance, (ſaid Pamphilus) but if thou hadſt ſeene my heart, thou wouldſt rather iudge that my euill proceeded

from my ſpirit: True it is, that the body feeleth alſo the paines of the minde; What kind of euill is thine anſwered the young man, being ſo neare the place, where euils of wounded mindes are cured? For if thou art not within the Hoſpital, thou deſireſt (as it ſeemeth) to be in, ſeeing thou doeſt not deny thy euill; and thou confeſſeſt, that it proceedeth from thy minde, the paſſions whereof, are not farre from falling into that infirmity, which is cured in this place. The euill which I haue, (ſaid Pamphilus) hath a remedy in this houſe, and my misfortune is ſuch, that diſpairing to cure me, they haue flung me out. Thou canſt haue no ſuch euill, anſwered the young man, but there is an Antidote to bee found for it. Incurable Loue (ſaid Pamphilus is groaning out a ſigh) vnto which all the medicines & Herbes of Phyſicke are improfitable. What is not Loue to be cured, anſwered the other? And are Auicens ſeauen remedies of no force, and not true? Of thoſe ſaid Pamphilus, and at the tales which Pliny writeth, my paſſion worketh; I onely allow of his counſell, who aduiſeth chiefly to marry; but the diſpoſition of my fortune, and the rigorous influence of my ſtarres, not onely doe not ſuffer me, but maketh it to me almoſt impoſſible. And although hope ſometime promiſeth it vnto me, yet I find that it is truely as Plato calleth it; The waking man his Dreame: Loue, then (ſaid the young man) is the cauſe of this habite which thou weareſt, & of thy pilgrimage. It is ſo (ſaid Pamphilus) and by that thou mayeſt know the quality of my euill, and the difficulty of my cure. Oh, ſaid the young man pittifully ſighing, what a grieuous ſtory, doſt thou renew in me? A hiſtory like vnto

mine ſaid Pamphilus; if not ſaid the other, yet at the leaſt of Loue; By thy faith (then ſaid Pamphilus) doeſt thou loue? I not onely Loue ſaid the other, but am alſo more vnhappy then thou thinkeſt for; a ſtranger and a Pilgrim, and no leſſe outraged by fortune. Tell me then ſaid Pamphilus, (in looking earneſtly vpon him) thy name and of what Countrey thou art; for in all the yeares of my baniſhment, I could neuer finde any man ſo miſerably perſecuted as my ſelfe: and in this, I haue more occaſion, then all men to bewaile my deſtinies. A Chriſtian ſaid the ſtranger, ought neuer to bewaile the deſtinies, nor thinke that good or euill fortune depend of them: Although many ancient Philoſophers haue beleeued, that there is a kinde of Deuils, and certaine imaginary women which they call Parquae, which giue the ſpirit vnto the creature at the birth, an opinon rather worthy of laughter, then beliefe; It being moſt certaine, that this name Deſtiny, is onely to be attributed to the decree of God, who truly ſeeth and knoweth all thinges before they be, and the ordering of them cānot depend of any thing but of him; I know well ſaid Pamphilus, that the Poets haue called theſe Parquaes deſtiny, and the Philoſophers eſpecially the Stoyques, haue beleeued that it is an order, or diſpoſition of ſecond cauſes, as from the Planets vnder the influence of which we are borne, which rule and determine all the inferiour good and euill effects which doe happen to man: So ſaid Ptolomy, Democritus, Criſippus, and Epicurus, who alſo aſcribe to Deſtiny, all the inclinations, the vices, and the vertues, the deſires and paſſions euen vnto the actions and thoughts, which ſome ha
                     ••
                  
                  
endeuoured to proue by the authority of Boeceus, who ſaith, that the order of Deſtiny mooueth the Heauen, and the Starres tempereth the Elements, and tyeth humane actions to their cauſes by a moſt indiſſolueable knot.
               But leauing a part a matter of ſo long a diſcourſe, from whence is ſprung the error of the Priſcillianiſts, who doe beleeue that the ſoule and the body, are neceſſarily ſubiect vnto the Starres, and many other errors which doe ſucceed this firſt. I deſire thou ſhoulſt know, that I ſpeake according vnto cuſtome, which willeth that this name Deſteny, and other Chriſtian Idiomes, be taken for misfortune, beleeuing that neuertheleſſe, that God by his Diuine prouidence ſpeaketh by the Deſtiny as men expreſſe the conceptions of their minds by their wordes. Thy face (ſaith the young man) promiſeth no leſſe, then what I haue heard come from thy mouth; for thy preſence and aſpect is an index of thy noblenes, as thy tongue is of knowledge: which worketh in me a great pleaſure, and deſire to tell thee my Name, my Countrey, quality, and my misfortunes, which if thou pleaſe to hearken vnto with patience, I will as briefely as I can relate.
            
            
               The Hiſtory of Pamphilus, and Celio.
               
               THe Citty of Toledo, in the hart of Spaine; ſtrong by Scituation, noble by Antiquity, famous for the preſeruatiō of the Chriſtian Faith, euer ſithence the time of the Gothes, generous both in Learning and Armes, hauing a temperate Heauen, and a fertile Earth,

inuironed with the famous Riuer Tagus, which is it ſelfe alſo begirt with a high, but a pleaſant Hill: Is the place where my now liuing Parents were borne, as alſo my ſelfe, (although my Anceſtors in former times came from thoſe parts of Auſturia, which are called Santillana the ancient title of the houſe of Mendoſa) there was I brought vp in my more tender yeares: But when my Parents thought I was capable of Learning, they ſent me to the Vniuerſity of Salamanqua, with ſuch company as was fit for a man of my place, to the end that beſides the Latine tongue which I knew already, I might ſtudy the knowledge of the Law. Heere I am conſtrained to make a long digreſſion, becauſe that of the hiſtory of another, dependeth the foundation of mine. My Father had other Children; Liſard his eldeſt ſonne, who was in Flaunders with the Archduke Albert, where hee got no ſmall reputation, principally in the ſiege of Oſtend, and Niſa a Daughter, and if I bee not partiall, one of moſt excellent beauty, who liued in that honour and good name, vnto which ſhee was bound, by the noblenes of her birth, and the care of ſuch Parents.
               Vnto theſe tearmes, was the youngman proceeded in his diſcourſe, whereat Pamphilus exceedingly troubled, couered his face with his hands, whereof the other demaunding a reaſon; Pamphilus ſaid vnto him, that his griefe which had brought him vnto that eſtate wherein he found him was returned againe, yet hee thought it was with leſſe violence then it had formerly done. All this Pamphilus feyned, becauſe the ſtory which the Toledan tolde him, was his owne proper ſtory, and this Niſa whom he called his Siſter, was the Pilgrim whoſe wits

were loſt out of the apprehenſion of Pamphilus his Death; So doe acts diſſembled many times meete, and ſometimes doe then appeare moſt, when they are moſt indeauoured to bee hidden. I will not proceed in my ſtory ſaid he if thou finde not thy ſelfe ſo well, that thou maiſt hearken vnto me; for there is no time worſe imployed then that which one looſeth in ſpeaking to them, which giue no eare to the ſpeaker; Thou maiſt proceed ſaid Pamphilus, (being deſirous to vnderſtand the eſtate of his owne affaires) for I finde my griefe begins to leaue me, eaſed by thy preſence and thy words; I muſt aduertiſe thee then ſaid the young man, that there was in Madreele, a braue Knight, and a great friend of my fathers, with whome he had great inwardnes of acquaintance, euer ſince the warres of Granado, and I thinke they were together in that famous Battell of Lepanto: from this friendſhip it followed, that at the end of ſome yeares, they treated of the Marrying of my Siſter Niſa, with one of this Knights ſonnes, of whome I now ſpeake, and the young mans name was Pamphilus. But while theſe things were a doing, the Father of Pamphilus dyed, and the propoſition of marriage ceaſed. Pamphilus who by the renowne that went of my Siſter, as alſo by her Picture, was taken in her Loue, and grew wonderfull ſad and melancholy, and falling from one imagination to another, in the end hee reſolued vpon this which I ſhall tell thee, that thereby thou maiſt ſee how innocent, thoſe were, who without the light of Faith, did anciently beleeue it Fortune and Deſtinies. Which was, that making his Mother beleeue, that hee would goe into Flaunders, and iourneying ſome dayes in the

habite and equipage of a man at Armes, and after ſent his ſeruants to Alcala of Henares, and there diſguiſing himſelfe in other clothes, he went to Toledo: where not being knowne to any perſon, he found meanes to be entertained as a ſeruant in my fathers houſe, which was no hard matter to doe, becauſe that his excellent feature and countenance, accompanied with his vnderſtanding were pledges ſufficient of his fidelity, & gaue my Father not onely a deſire to bee ſerued by him, but alſo to reſpect him.
               My father receiued him, ignorant of his quality, and of his intent (a ſtrange imagination of a man, beeing a Knight, and ſo well knowne almoſt of all, in the Countrey wherein he was borne; that he could ſo hide himſelfe, at the Doore (as it were) of his owne houſe, that no body could know, either where hee was or what hee did:) yet ſo it was, that his humility, his diligent ſeruice, and other commendable partes, which hee had, gained ſuch credit with my Parents, that I doe beleeue he might as eaſily haue compaſſed his deſignes, with his fayned pouerty, as with his true riches.
               The chiefeſt thing whereunto he applyed himſelfe as his whole ſtudy, was to appeare agreable to Niſa, which was eaſie to be done, for who can guard himſelfe from a domeſticke enemy? The ſimplicity wherewith this Knight did begin his treaſon, and the good wordes which he vſed, gained him entrance into thoſe places, whereinto hardly and with great difficulty, could the ancient ſeruants come. Behold with how little care, a noble Gentleman kept in his houſe, another Greeke horſe, like vnto miſerable Troy: For ſuch of neceſſity

muſt this young mans heart needs bee, full of thoughts and armed with malice, which (the houre of execution approaching) brake forth into ſuch flames, as haue fired our renowne. When Pamphilus thought that Niſa was diſpoſed to hearken to his intention, were it that his ſicknes were true, or fained; as moſt likely it was, he made himſelfe ſicke. My parents, who accounted of this ſeruant as of their gouernour, and loued him equal with their deareſt Children, there being no key about the houſe, no accompt in all their expence, nor any ſecret in their affaires, wherein hee was not truſted: cauſed him to bee tended with all the care which was poſſible for loue and reſpect to bring. The Phyſitians ſaid, that this infirmity proceded from a deepe melancholy, and the beſt remedy that was to be giuen, was to reioyce him, and principally by Muſicke; In which they were not deceiued, for if Loue doe participate of the euill ſpirit, and that Dauid draue away the euill ſpirit from Saul by the ſweetnes of his Harpe, by the ſame meanes Loue might be driuen away. Thou ſayeſt true, ſaid Pamphilus, (who gaue great attention vnto the relation of his own ſtory, to ſee to what end the diſcourſe of this youngman would come, who was his Miſtreſſes Brother) for without doubt it holdeth many conditions of the euill ſpirit, and leauing a part the principall which is to torment with fire, behold the ſimpathy which they haue one with the other. The Deuils doe delight themſelues in thinges which are naturally melancholy, inhabiting in horrible places, obſcure and ſolitary, as louing darkenes and ſadnes: All which qualities are common with them which Loue, and cannot

attaine to that which they pretend, they deſire ſolitary places, and the dens of Deſerts, there to entertaine in ſilence their ſad thoughts, without any thing to trouble them, no not the light of heauen. But let me intreat thee to proceed, in thy ſtory of this Knight, for I deſire with paſſion to know the end.
               My Siſter Niſa, ſaid Celio, then (for ſo was the young man called) could play admirable well of the Lute, and ſung ſo ſweetly that in the like danger, the Dolphin wold willinglier haue brought her to the ſhore, then hee did Arion ſometimes to Corinth. Wherfore by the conſent of my Parents, and not againſt her will; ſhee went into Pamphilus his little Chamber, (Conſider with thy ſelfe the happy glory of a man in his caſe) and ſung a Poeme which he himſelfe had compoſed, for hee had that way a dexterious facility, and very naturall, neither did it want the excellency of Art. But whileſt Niſa ſung, Pamphilus wept, and neuer turned his eyes from of hers; So that one reſembled the Crocadile, and the other Sirene, vnles that one ſung to giue him health, and the other wept to deceiue her of her honour. Niſa ſeing this his extremity of ſadnes, ſaid vnto him; that her intent was not that her muſicke ſhould haue the ſame effect in him as it had in others, which is, to make them more ſad, which are any way heauy, but contrarily, her deſire was to reioyce him. There is (anſwered he) no other voyce nor other harmony, vnleſſe it may bee the harmony of Heauen, can reioyce me but yours: Neuertheleſſe my euill being paſt hope of cure, bindeth me to bewaile my ſelfe, and not to thinke vpon any thing, but vpon the beauty which cauſeth it; What euill is that (ſaid Niſa)
                  
paſt cure, which proceedeth from a cauſe commended by thee? It is an euill (anſwered Pamphilus) whereof I doe hinder the cure, and whereof the onely comfort is to know, that I ſuffer it, for the faireſt creature in the world. The liberty wherein wee liue (ſaid Niſa) doth giue me leaue Pamphilus, to ſpeake vnto thee heere of a ſuſpitious matter: by the tokens which thou haſt deliuered vnto me of thy euill, thou haſt giuen me knowledge of the occaſion that makes thee ſicke, although I am ignorant of the cauſe, who makes thee ſicke: Thou loueſt without doubt, and I take it in good part, that thou wouldſt confeſſe vnto me, that, which thou wouldeſt not ſpeake vnto the Phyſitians, aſſuring thee, that thou mayſt better truſt my Loue then their Art. But I coniure thee, by that goodwill which thou knoweſt I haue born thee euer ſince thou haſt ſerued my Parents, that thou wilt tell me whether I know her whome thou loueſt, and whether I can bee helpfull vnto thee in thy curing, for thy teares doe make me pitty thee. You may well ſerue to helpe me pittifull Niſa, (ſaid then the cunning Louer, who might well haue inſtructed Ouid) ſeeing I doe not hope for it from any other hands then yours, and that you know the cauſe of my paine, aſwell as you knowe your ſelfe.
               Heere Pamphilus demaunded of Celio (wondring that bee ſhould tell ſo perticularly, that which paſſed ſo ſecretly betweene him and Niſa) how hee knew the ſame wordes which they had ſpoken, hee being at that time a farre off, following his ſtudy in Salamanqua? To which Celio anſwered, that the ſame Pamphilus had left the ſtory in writing with a friend of his, from whome hauing

had the meanes ſince that time to get it, hee learned all vnto the leaſt particuler, and then proceeding on his diſcourſe, he began in this manner.
               The colour which came into Niſa's face when ſhee heard Pamphilus his wordes, cannot bee compared, but vnto the red Roſe, with milken leaues, although it be a Poeticall terme, and borrowed of the ſame author, yet feyning not to vnderſtand what he ſaid, ſhee anſwered, that if it were any of her friends ſhee would indeauour (at the leaſt) to bring it about that ſhee ſhould knowe his euill, that thereupon he might lay the foundation of his remedy. I am in that eſtate ſaid Pamphilus that I dare not ſo much as ſigh or breath out her name, yet I can ſhew you her portrature, who is the originall cauſe of my misfortune, and for whoſe ſake, I am come from my own Country into yours, where I remaine an humble ſeruant of your houſe, and doe thinke my ſelfe moſt happy to be ſo, although I am a Knight, and equall vnto her, whome you call your friend, and with whome I ſhould haue bin now marryed, if my Father had liued vntill this day, for onely his Death barred me of this happines. And in ſaying theſe wordes, Pamphilus gaue her, her Picture, which had bin drawne by the moſt excellent Painter of our time, called Philip of Lianho; whoſe penſill oftentimes durſt compare with Nature herſelfe, who out of meere enuy vnto him, for that, (as it ſeemed) ſhortned his dayes. Yet Niſa (through whoſe veynes ran a colde ſhiuering) affirmed, that ſhee did not know the face; I doe not wonder ſaid Pamphilus, that the auntient Philoſopher hath deliuered his opinion; that it is a very hard matter to know ones ſelfe.

Putting this ſentence; Know thy ſelfe; in the fronts of the moſt famous Temples. Yet ſee another more naturall, the knowledge wherof you cānot deny. Saying this, he reached her a very faire looking-glaſſe: Niſa ſeeing her face within the Chriſtall, could no longer ſuffer his diſcourſe, nor the Knights preſence: But riſing vp in collor, ſaid vnto him in great anger as ſhe went away, thy boldnes ſhall coſt thee thy life. Can it bee better imployed anſwered Pamphilus, then for your beauty to be ended?
               She anſwered well, ſaid the Pilgrim, if ſhee had accompliſhed what ſhe ſaid. She accompliſhed it ſo ill replied Celio, that within a fewe dayes ſhee loued him, better then ſhe loued herſelfe, prouing the Verſe of the famous Poet Dant to bee infallibly true; that Loue excuſeth no one who is beloued from louing. But how came it (ſaid the Pilgrim) that a Mayd ſhould Loue; who had harkened with ſo much diſdaine in the beginning? Becauſe anſwered Celio, that all Mayds for their firſt anſwer conſult with ſhame, and for their ſecond conſult with weaknes: Although for my owne part, I thinke that Pamphilus diſpairing of his remedy helped himſelfe with charmes. I cannot beleeue ſo, anſwered Pamphilus, a man hath liberty to Loue, and not to loue as it ſeemeth good vnto himſelfe, and it ſeemes to bee a terrible and cruell thing that a chaſt woman ſhould be violently conſtrained to Loue, whether ſhee would or no: Charmes and witchcrafts, may peraduenture moue, perſwade, and tempt, without ſuffering to be in reſt, and with theſe exteriour perſwaſions make one yeeld vnto the prayers and teares of a Louer: Yet for all this it

cannot be ſaid, that ſhee is conſtrained but that of her good will, ſhee giueth conſent to her deſire, ſuffering her ſelfe rather to bee vanquiſhed by her owne proper nature, then by the force of any Art Magicke. Wherefore it is an euident folly, in thoſe which Loue, to complaine that they are violently conſtrained, will they nill they, to follow their Loues, becauſe God neuer ſuffeteth that the po
                     •
                  er of free-will ſhould bee taken from Man; and if any one ſay hee hath bin forced by Diabolicall perſwaſions, it may be anſwered, hee was not forced in his reaſon, but in his concupiſcence: Neither is it to be beleeued, that a Knight, a Chriſtian, wiſe, young and braue Gentleman, would helpe himſelfe with ſuch wicked meanes to attaine his ends. It is not likely, anſwered Celio, and it may be, that hee witneſſing his fidelity by other ſeruices, obliged her to condiſcend vnto his will, for Niſa is not the onely woman in this world ſubiect to this weaknes.
               Neuertheles behold the ſtrange accident, which happened vnto them both, as a beginning of their misfortunes; for it being ſpoken at Madreele, that Pamphilus was come from Flanders, the newes thereof came vnto my Fathers eares, who (deſirous to make him his Son in Law, in fauour of the ancient acquaintance and loue he had with his Father, and becauſe that it had been formerly agreed betweene them) one day tolde her, that hee was reſolued to Marry her, not naming vnto whome; and thereupon writing to Madreele, to Pamphilus his Mother, intreating her to ſend him to Toledo, congratulating alſo with her, her Sonnes happy return and the proſperous ſucceſſe of his affaires, and remembred

vnto her the amitie which he had contracted with her husband, his Father. The ſad Niſa, who already deſperatly loued Pamphilus, tolde him, that her Father would marry her, and the Knight who was deſigned for her Husband, was ſhortly to come from Madreele vnto their houſe, but ſhee knew nothing in particuler more of him, but that he was a braue Soldier who lately came out of Flanders. Pamphilus (ignorant that hee was the perſon who was meant) fell into great extremity at the newes, and after many teares and other follies, hee ſaid, he was reſolued to be gone, for his heart would neuer ſuffer him to ſee a new ſeruant vnto his Miſtris in this houſe. A ſtrange and neuer heard of ſtory, that a man ſhould bee iealous of himſelfe, and flye from his owne preſence. Niſa who now thought it as impoſſible for her to bee without Pamphilus, as the Earth without water, Fire without matter to burne, or as the Coeleſtiall harmony without their firſt mouer; ſaid vnto him in weeping, that ſhee would haue him take her away with him, and that ſhe would follow him ouer the world; yet vpon this condition, that hee ſhould ſweare ſolemnly, neuer to looſe the reſpect which was due vnto her honour: which oath being taken by Pamphilus without any conſideration of the danger which might happen: he made choyſe of a darke night, & by a Garden which anſwereth vpon the Riner, tooke her from the houſe, and by the ſame riuer went from the Towne, carrying her in his Barke, vntill he came vnto thoſe Mountaines which are called Stſla: This was it which hee writ afterwards from Valence, to a friend of his of Saragoſſa.
               
               Now followeth the beginning of my peregrination,

which (hauing bin to long in this Hiſtory) I will briefly relate. At the dolourous Letter which was written to me of this ſucceſſe, (which was diſcouered, ſo ſoone as Pamphilus was gone from Toledo) I came from Salamanqua to my fathers houſe, which I found all in mourning for the loſſe of my Siſter. My Father in few words obliged me to reuenge it, which I ſwore that I would, with many wordes as free, as his were graue: and to execute my intent I went to Madreele. I ſought Pamphilus in all the houſes of his friends, and viſited his Mother, asking newes of him, making ſhew how things had paſſed. The innocent Mother ſaid, it was two yeares ſince hee went into Flaunders, and that from the time of his departure, ſhe neuer had heard from him, from whence ſhe collected he was dead. I thought that ſhe, knowing what he had done, had diſguiſed the truth: and while I was in this meditation, I caſting my eyes vpon a young Gentlewoman, who ſate ſowing by this reuerend matron, I found her in my minde ſo faire, that her onely looke, had power to temper my ſorrow, and hardly had I fully viewed her perfections, when as I propounded in my ſelfe to ſerue her, and to ſteale her away, thinking by this meanes to giue ſatisfaction to our honour, and beginning to my reuenge. To recount vnto you at this time all the paſſages, and the care which I vſed to ſpeake with her, and to bring her to my will, would be to trouble you with a long diſcourſe; Let it ſatisfie, that I drewe her from her houſe with the ſame thred, where with Pamphilus had pulled Niſa from ours, and in a ſtrange and fooliſh minde led her into France, where her beauty miniſtred ſubiect vnto a Knight to ſerue her,

and for me to kill him: From whence it followed, that for ſafety of my life I was driuen to leaue her. Neuertheleſſe, I am reſolued whatſoeuer happen vnto me, to goe ſeeke her, becauſe that beſides, I doe loue her more then my ſelfe, I owe ſo much vnto her merit and vertue, with which ſhee hath faithfully accompanied me, thorough many and variable ſucceſſes.
               Night had ſpred his blacke vayle ouer the face of the Earth, and the houſes were full of Candles, as the Heauen of ſtarres; men and creatures retired themſelues, from their common labour, when as the miſerable Pamphilus gaue ouer hearing the tragedy of his Loue, with the laſt act of his honour: and to know that he did then but begin to ſuffer his euils, when he thought he was at an end of them, Hee admired the iuſtice of Heauen, which had ſuffred that his Siſter ſhould ſo lightly haue quited her Mothers houſe, to runne away with a man; Yet finding in himſelfe the example of his owne miſleading of Niſa, and that the iniury which hee had done vnto Celio, was no leſſe then that which hee had receiued; he did not hold it iuſt in himſelfe, once to thinke of reuenge, but rather to perſwade him that hee ſhould not, nor ought to leaue her, which he performed with the beſt wordes, & the liuelieſt reaſons he could deuiſe. Remonſtrating vnto him, that amongſt Gentlemen, the onely condition of noblenes, ſhould binde him to goe ſeeke for her, which Celio allowing for moſt reaſonable, gaue him his word, to imploy his endeauours to that purpoſe. And being lodged this night together, they ſupped and ſlept in one houſe. The next morning Pamphilus gaue him a Letter to a French Gentleman, with

whom he had great acquaintance, that he might fauour him in finding out Finia, for ſo was his Siſter called. But Celio departed not for certain dayes, during which time there was a perfect friendſhip knit betweene thoſe two ſecret enemies; So that Pamphilus knowing the offence which Celio had done vnto him, pardoned him in his hart, and Celio ignorant that this was Pamphilus, was diſpoſed to the pardoning of him. The reſolution was with great oathes to enquire out one the other, and to helpe each other in all accidents as Brothers; aſſigning the rende-vous within ſixe monthes, in the Citty of Pamphelune.
               
               So went Celio vpon his enterpriſe; & ſome few dayes after his departure, Pamphilus his ſorrow increaſing out of the opinion that it was impoſſible for him to recouer Niſa; It happened that going one night from his lodging, in a vaine deſire he had to ſee the windowes of the Priſon (where his happines and ioy was incloſed) he heard a Knight cry out for helpe againſt ſome who would at aduantage haue killed him. He ſodainly ſtepped vnto him, and drawing out his Sword out of his Palmers ſtaffe with an incredible dexterity, accompanied with a valiant & braue courage, made them looſe him, whom they would haue killed, and ſaue their own liues by a ſhamefull, though a ſafe flight.
               The Knight would needs know what hee was, who had deliuered him from ſo great danger: and although Pamphilus excuſed himſelfe from telling his name, yet the Knights deſire, and curteſie preuayled more, then the humblenes wherewith the Pilgrim did endeauour to perſwade him, that hee had done him no ſeruice: to

conclude, he led him to his houſe, where his good and gentle behauiour being obſerued, the Knight and his Parents bare ſuch affection vnto him, that they did oblige him to become their gueſt.
               There remained Pamphilus ſome dayes, at the end of which, Iacinth (ſo was this Knight called) tolde him the hiſtory of his Loue, vnto faire Lucinde, and the occaſion for which theſe aſſaſſiuators wold haue murther'd him, who, for this onely cauſe, were come from Ciuill vnto Valence, where the ſubiect of the paſſion, and the ſorrow wherein he liued did remaine. I doe beleeue that Louers haue ſome ſimpathy one with another, and that they ioyne and communicate, in ſuch manner as you haue ſeene in this diſcourſe. Seeing that our Pilgrim neuer came into any houſe, where there was not ſome one, or other tainted with this euill, although it were in craggy Mountaines.
               By this ouerture of Iacinthes ſecret, Pamphilus was bound to diſcouer his: and after hee had made him ſweare, that he would graunt him his requeſt, hee ſaid; that in recompence of his life, which hee had ſaued, as he himſelfe confeſſed, he coniured him, to helpe him to a place, in that Priſon where the mad ſolkes were ſhut vp. Iacinth aſtoniſhed at ſo ſtrange a requeſt, would needs know the cauſe. But Pamphilus promiſing to tell him ſo ſoone as he had done him that fauour, and caſting himſelfe at his feete with moſt earneſt and vnheardof wordes, affirming the good hee ſhould doe him, to put him in this place: made Iacinth ſuſpect, that ſome ſecret danger did inforce him into that place. And willing very generouſly to ſatisfie the obligation wherein

hee was tyed, after ſome inconueniences and reaſons vrged to diuert him, hauing agreed with him of the meanes which he ſhould holde, This very night Iacinth tooke fiue or ſixe men of the Hoſpitall, who entring ſodainly into Pamphilus his Chamber, put him in a Chayre, and carryed him away in their armes: miſerable condition of this man, who after ſo many ſtrange ſucceſſes, being wiſe (if thoſe who Loue can be ſo) to make himſelfe to bee taken and ſhut vp willingly, as a mad-man, where all the mad folkes would willingly bee accounted wiſe.
               All Iacinthes houſe admire at this nouelty, and all his family complaine that this ſtranger, vnto whom Iacinth was redeuable for his life, was ſo vnworthily requited by Iacinth himſelfe: But ſhee who moſt complained of his cruelty, and had the trueſt feeling of it, was Tiberia his Siſter, who was both faire and diſcreet aboue all the Ladies in Valence, who affecting the gentlenes, and faire ſpirit of our vnfortunate Pilgrim, did not ſee but by his eyes, and did not breath but from him. Iacinth told them that Pamphilus was mad, and that it was neceſſary hee ſhould be cured before the diſeaſe increaſed too farre. The Father of this Knight, who was very Learned, blamed exceedingly this precipite courſe, ſaying that in all infirmities, there was nothing more dangerous, then Phyſicke out of ſeaſon, and ſwore that he ſhould be had out of the Hoſpitall, to bee cured in his houſe. Tiberia confirmed this piety, ſaying; that reward due vnto him, they being not ſo poore, but that they had meanes ſufficient, to haue him cured in their houſe, with greater care of his health, and leſſe ſcandall to his honour.

                  Iacinth replyed, that he was a Stranger, & that no body knew him. But all the houſhold were ſo much againſt him, blaming him for ingratitude, eſpecially his Father, & his Siſter, that he was conſtrayned to tell them what he knew. Whereat in imagining the cauſe, all of them were aſtoniſhed and wondred. They thought that Pamphilus was a ſpy, who went diſguiſed vnder the habite of a Pilgrim, and that fearing to be knowne by ſome one, hee vſed this ſubtilty to ſaue his life: for although he ſpake Spaniſh, neuertheleſſe, by his faire face and exceeding beauty, he ſeemed a ſtranger, and by his actions a Gentleman. With this confeſſion, Iacinth remained in their good opinion, the houſe was much troubled, and Tiberia was full of pittifull griefe and care for Pamphilus his life: who being in Priſon among the mad folkes (in the iudgement of many, the very center of greateſt miſery) imagined himſelfe to bee in moſt glorious happines.
               To this new Madman, the more ancient gaue place, and Pamphilus, with diuers faynings & counterfetings of his face, endeauoured to expreſſe his madnes; which faſhion of his, ſeeming vnto them as tokens of raſhnes, they put him into the Priſon with Irons on his handes, where to confirme them the more in their opinion of his madnes, hee ſaid ſo many wordes ſo farre from the matter, that hee did merit a beleefe. There he ſtayed ſome fewe dayes before he could ſee his beloued Niſa, ſuffering moſt inſupportable diſcommodities, difficult to be ſpoken, and almoſt impoſſible to bee beleeued; In the meane time Celio went by Saragoſſe into France, to finde his beautifull and beloued Finia whom hee had

loſt, where being come, hee heard the newes of the Peace which was proclaimed, betweene the two Nations, which made him reſt that night (with more contentment out of the facility which it brought to his deſigne) ſtaying for the Light of the morning, to cleere his paſſage ouer the Mountaines into France.

            The Third Booke.
            
               WHileſt the ſad and afflicted Celio entred into France by the Mountaines of Iaca to ſee if hee could finde his deere Finia; our Pilgrim Pamphilus hauing gotten out of the Priſon, as a mad man whoſe fury was ouer, was admitted to the table where others did eate, where alſo ſate his ſaire Niſa; neare vnto whom he did alwaies indeauour to ſit, and there and in all other conuenient places, he tolde her his Fortunes. She blamed him for putting himſelfe into this place, although ſhee did acknowledge how ſhe was tyed vnto him, for this his great folly.
            
               Pamphilus as a true I ouer, who onely aymed at the end of his loue, which was to Marry her, and who had ſworne by a thouſand oathes, to reſiſt the violence of his deſires, vntill a lawfull marriage would ſuffer him

to accompliſh them: ſaid vnto her in comforting her, that if ſhee had ſuffered this miſery for him, and that they ought to be all one, there was no reaſon but hee ſhould haue his part of this miſery, to the end that equall in all thinges, their marriage might bee, without aduantage of one ſide or other, and that his Loue vnto her did preuaile ſo farre as not to let paſſe one day, without ſeeing her, notwithſtanding any danger, and although his honour were thereby in hazard. The ſeruants of the houſe did not hinder their ſpeaking together, becauſe that Niſa being apparelled like a man, and hauing a care that her hayre ſhould not diſcouer her ſexe, euery body did beleeue that ſhe was as ſhe ſeemed to bee. For although that her beauty were extreame, yet the world hath not any ſo great, but it appeareth little, being much neglected; eſpecially ſeeing, that if Art doe not poliſh the beautifulleſt and fineſt Diamonds, and that they bee not ſet in golde with inamilling, and other neceſſary ornaments, they ſhew not the luſter, grace nor beauty, which they haue being artificially cut and ſet in a foyle by cunning workmen.
            The miſery of this kinde of life, ſeemed vnto our two Louers as nothing in regard of the former trauels which they had ſuffered, as I haue heard it often ſaid by many: and I my ſelfe know by experience that if two Louers may ſee, and ſpeake together, they haue no feeling of the miſeries, which doe ſerue them as meanes to attaine thereunto. Oh what will not thoſe which Loue reſolue of! What is it, which doth not ſeeme poſſible vnto them? Whar trauels can weary them? And what dangers can make them feare? O Loue ſtrong as death:

ſeeing that a Louer liuing in that which he loueth, and being dead in himſelfe, hath no more feeling of torment then a body depriued of a ſoule. With what teares were theſe two ſeperated at night, by the cruell officers of this Priſon? (If it bee cruelty to deale rigorouſly with mad folkes) with what care and languiſhment did they attend the day, that they might ſee one the other? what diſcreet follies did they vtter in publicke, full of equiuocations to deceiue thoſe who heard them, and to diuert the euils which they ſuffered? And with what amorous diſcourſes did they in particuler warme their deſires to marry? How much doth he commend Niſa's vertue, and the chaſt, but louing defence which ſhee made of her honour, for Pamphilus being a man had yeelded often vnto his paſſion, if ſhee had not moderated his violence. With what grace they gaue madly, fauours one vnto another, of the vildeſt thinges they could finde vpon the ground, which Pamphilus ſtucke in his hat, in ſteed of Iewels or feathers, which he was wont to weare: But fortune enuying their contentednes, euen in this miſery, would not let them liue in this place at reſt, but arming himſelfe a new againſt them, euen at that time when as they thought (by Iacinthes helpe) to get out of that Priſon, There came vnto this Citty an Italian Earle, of the houſe of Anquilora called Emelio, who deſiring to haue a Foole with him, promiſed a great Almes vnto their houſe, if they would giue him a mad-man, who hauing loſt his fury might entertaine him with ſport. Thoſe of the Hoſpitall ſayled not to promiſe him one, and withall to bring him to his lodging ſome of their moſt peaceable mad-men,

amongſt whome, were the Pilgrim Pamphilus and the faire Niſa. The Earle ioyfull to ſee them, inquired of their bringers their conditions? one of whome anſwered thus:
            This man ſtrong & able who you ſee there, was ſometimes a braue Soldier, who hauing ſerued vpon many occaſions like a Hector, deſired the reward of his valour which he had meritted aboue all other. But he finding himſelfe denied, and that it was giuen vnto the cowardlieſt fellow in the Army: fell from this imaginatiō into ſo profound a melancholy, that hee loſt his wits. He hath loſt his fury in the Priſon although oftentimes it returneth. His diſcourſe is alwayes of Marſhalling an Army, of beſieging a Fort, of lodging a Campe, or cauſing it to march. All is Sluces, Dikes, Trenches, Platformes, Rauelins, Caſſamats, Flanckers, Palliſadoes, Counterſcarfes, Squadrons, Cannons, Muskets, Piſtols, Corſelets, Pikes. This weake and pale man, is of another humor, who hauing giuen himſelf too much to the ſtudy of Philoſophy, loſt his vnderſtanding. Of this man the Earle demanded which was the Primum mobile, either Coelum Imperium, or Coelum Chriſtalinum? vnto whom the madman anſwered thus:
            After the mouing Sphaeres by a locall motion, the Diuines doe teach vs, that there is another Heauen perpetually in reſt from all motion, created from the beginning, and full of an innumerable thouſands of intelligences, and of happy ſpirits, which were created together in it, & with it. In ſuch ſort as the mingled bodyes are accuſtomed to ingender ſome thinges in inferiour places, as Fiſhes in the water, Birdes in the ayre, and

the vegitatiue creatures, Plants and Minerals in the earth. This Heauen for the greatnes, and for the ineſtimable light, for which it is called Imperiall, as who ſhould ſay Fiery (not for the naturall property of Fire, but for the glorious cleerneſſe wherewith it ſhineth) is the Throne deſtined before the conſtitution of the world, and as a Royall pallace ordained from the beginning, for all thoſe who are to raigne before the face of God, the light whereof is ſo luſtrous and cleere, that the corporall eyes cannot behold or looke vpon it, no more then the Birds of the night can the Sunne.
            All the aſſiſtants remaining aſtoniſhed at this diſcourſe, one other of the mad-men began to cry, calling his Dogs, and lewring his Haukes, like a great Fauconer and Huntſman as he had beene; of whome, as the Earle began to laugh, Pamphilus ſaid thus vnto him; you ought not mocke at this exerciſe, but at thoſe who exerciſe it vnorderly and vntimely, without reſpecting either ſeaſon or place: For according to Xenephon and Athaneus, Hunting was famous amongſt the Perſians. Homer ſaith, it was practiſed amongſt the Greeks, that thereby their Young men might become more hardy; For as Horace writeth, the Hunter often lyeth abroad in the colde night, without remembring his wife. Philon the Hebrew telleth notable thinges of Hunting, in his Preface vnto his warfare. Cicero ſaith no leſſe, in his book of The nature of the Gods. And Peter Gregory ſaith, that the originall therof, was in the beginning of the world, to the end that men ſhould be able to free themſelues from the perſecutions of Beaſts. If Hunting replyed the Earle, (who was a man of great knowledge) had not

paſſed from the honeſt exerciſe, (the imitation of warre) vnto that of pleaſure, who would doubt of the excellency thereof? but in regard of the hurt it doth in the fieldes, and the expence which it bringeth vnto him who followeth it? Lewes the twelfth King of France iuſtly forbad it: For what elſe is the meaning of the fable of Acteon, deuoured by his Dogs, but that ouermuch Hunting waſteth both goods and life? And paſſing by many other thinges, which might be gathered from this Verſe of Virgill, Where hee ſaith, Eneas and ſad Dido went a hunting together in a Wood: Ioyned alſo the dangers of life which cannot bee tolde, neither is it to bee wondred at, that this man became mad, ſeeing that as Dion aſſureth the ſame exerciſe made the Emperour Adrian a foole. Then anſwered the mad Hunter, that with more reaſon ſhould hee be laide in this place for a madman, becauſe he would perſwade mad-men, and reaſon with them who had no reaſon.
            The diſcourſe of this madman, ſaith the Earle ſauoring nothing of madnes; obligeth me to anſwer: For a man muſt fight with thoſe who giue occaſion, play with ſuch as haue money, and anſwer vnto euery one in the ſame manner hee ſpeaketh. But if all the madmen in Spaine, were as you, and that my Children ſhold remaine there, I ſhould rather deſire to haue them ignorant then Learned; Know ſaid the Foole that if it were poſſible a man ſhould deſire to be borne in France to liue in Italy, and to dye in Spaine, to be borne for the noblenes of the French, who alwayes haue had their King of their owne Nation, and neuer mingled with any other; To liue, for the liberty and felicity of Italy:
               
And to dye; for the Catholicke Faith which is ſo certaine in all Spaine. And as concerning your Children, whatſoeuer happens of it, ſuffer them not to liue in Ignorance; For there is leſſe danger in being mad, then in being ignorant. Whileſt this man ſpake, another ſinging neare vnto him, let the Earle knowe that Muſicke had brought him to that eſtate, for it is ſaid; that it is a kinſwoman vnto Poetry: The ancients ſaid the mad-man, haue compriſed Muſicke amongſt the Liberall Sciences. Ariſtotle in his Politiques, Budeus in his Commentary vpon the Greeke tongue, and Cealio the Rodian, doe ſay, that Muſicke is a mixture compounded of ſounds ſweet, flat and ſharpe. Plutarque in the life of Homer, putteth one voyce flat, and the other ſharpe, the flat voyce proceedeth from within, and the ſharpe from the ſuperfices of the mouth, and from their diuers tempering maketh the harmony; the obiect of the hearing is the ſound, and the reflection of the ayre; as Galen teacheth; and the ſound is made from the act of ſome one thing into another, by the meanes of the ſtroake which cauſeth it: two bodyes are required to make a ſound, becauſe that one cannot doe it. The Eccho is an ayre ſtrucke into hollow places, which reſiſting the ſtroke of the voyce, returneth the ſame wordes which are ſpoken. So ſay Themiſerus, Pliny, Ouid, and Macrobius in his Saturnales. The voyce and the worde are not one thing, the worde holdeth the ground from the Tongue helped by the Noſtrils, the Lips and the Teeth: and the inſtruments of the Voyce are the Throat, the Muſtles which mooue, and the Nerues which come downe from the Braine.
            
               
Who was the firſt inuenter of Muſick, asked the Earle? The mad-man anſwered, Ioſephus ſaith, that it was Thuball, Adams nephew, although that others giue the inuention to Mercury, as Gregory Gerand: and Philoſtratus ſaith, that Mercury learned it of Orpheus, Orpheus of Amphion. But Euſebius attributeth it vnto Father Dioniſius. Then asked the Earle into how many partes Muſicke was diuided? The mad-man anſwered, according vnto Boetius, into the Theorique and the Practique, bee it either Naturall, Artificiall, Celeſtiall or humane; The Naturall and Celeſtiall, is that which is conſidered in the harmony of all the parts of the world: the Humane is that which treateth of the proportions of the body and of the ſoule, and their partes: For Plato, Pithagoras, and Architas, haue thought, that the motions and conuerſions of the Starres, cannot bee without Muſicke: And Vitruuius is of that opiuion, that buildings are not framed without Muſicke. Leauing Celeſtiall and humane, there followeth Artificiall diuided into muſicall Organs and Inſtruments.
            Thereupon the other mad-men began to put in practiſe, that whereof hee onely ſhewed the Theorique, and began to make ſuch a noyſe with confuſed, and diſcording voyces, that it was impoſſible to vnderſtand them. But being appeaſed, hee who kept the mad-men, made great account vnto the Earle, of a mad Aſtrologian, who by the contemplation of ſuch high thinges was fallen into this abaſement. Hardly had the Earle looked vpon him, when he began to tell him, that the compoſition, and figure of the world, In its forme was called a Sphaere which was ſollid, and that paſſing aliue

through the middle, the Poles were placed in the extreames or verticall points immouable: one made the North on this ſide of the Beare, and from the Starres of that part of Heauen called Aquilon, Boreall, or Artique; The other which was oppoſite by Diamiter was called Antartique and Meridionall; There was hee interrupted by others, who would not let him proceed, and after it was not poſſible to appeaſe them, although there were a great many more, Painters, Poets, and Mathematicians, but aboue all, there was an Alcumiſt, a famous Diſciple of Ramond Lullius.
            
            At this time Emilius had fixed his eyes vpon Niſa, and beholding the ſadnes, with which ſhee was ſilent, hee demanded of the Maſter the humour of this mad creature? who anſwered him, that Loue had brought him to his folly, her delicate face, and the occaſion of her euill, gaue him at the ſame time, deſire and compaſſion with ſuch affection, that agreeing with the Maſter, at the price of a hundred Crownes, hee made choyſe of her from amongſt all the other to leade her into Italy; But hardly had Pamphilus ſeene the effects of his election, when as his fury increaſing truely, which was before but fained, hee ſtrucke, he bit, and tooke on, as if he had beene inraged, againſt thoſe who tooke his deare Niſa away. But they being a great many againſt him alone, the Earle tooke her from the houſe, and ſhortly after from Valence. And Pamphilus tyed vp as a mad-man, was had backe againe with many grieuous blowes, bewayling bitterly the loſſe of his deare Niſa. And by how much he indeauoured, to make the Officers belieue that hee was not mad, by ſo much the more he perſwaded

them, that he was not well in his wits: Becauſe being oppreſſed with griefe he tolde them plainely, that he had cauſed himſelfe to be brought thether, onely to ſee this young mad creature, whome they had accounted to bee a man, but indeed was a Woman and his wife, whom hee had concealed vnder this habit, for feare of her Father, from whom he had ſtollen her away.
            But they were ſo confirmed in their opinion of his madnes, that by thoſe reaſons, whereby hee did thinke they were tyed to giue him his liberty, hee made them more obſtinate to refuſe him, vntill they might haue more euident tokens of the tranquillity of his minde. Whileſt he did complaine to ſee that it ſerued him to no purpoſe to tell the truth, which of all thinges in the world doth moſt inrage a man, and that in regard of Iacinthes abſence, he could not tell vnto whom to haue recourſe: The vnfortunate Niſa was come to Barcelon, with ſo much ſorrow and teares, that Emilio already repented that hee had bought her: In aſmuch as there is nothing more vnprofitable then a ſad Foole. The Earle imbarked, not knowing that ſhe whom he led with him had the fortune of Scianus Horſe, which coſt his Maſters their liues: He indeauoured to reioyce Niſa, cauſing her to ſit at his Table, to make her eate meate, becauſe it was tolde him, that ſhe would famiſh her ſelfe to death, where earneſtly beholding her face, and conſidering her actions, he did ſuſpect, that ſhe was neither mad, nor a man: He let this day paſſe ouer, and the next day hee was aſſured of both; In as much as ſo great a ſadnes could not bee fayned; And that Niſa's reſerued

ſpeech, and the modeſty of her lookes declared openly that which vpon other occaſions, ſhe had couered with ſo much care; Emilio being then perſwaded that this mad creature was a Woman, or at the leaſt hauing euident tokens therof, inquired with great care of her ſadnes? vſing her as a Gentlewoman, and with reſpect due vnto her ſex. Niſa who had now neither care to diſguiſe herſelfe nor to liue, confeſſed ſhee was a woman, and would not be comforted by Emilio's wordes: But Emilio, who the more hee conuerſed with her, the more was ingaged in her Loue; in the end ſuffered himſelfe to be vanquiſhed in her beauty: for Niſa now ceaſing to appeare as a man captiuated all thoſe who beheld her, with her maruailous grace. Loue then began to make himſelfe maſter ouer Emilio through pitty, which is the cloake vnder which it entreth into our mindes; as the Pill vnder golde, that the bitternes may not offend: and his paſſion increaſed ſo farre, as to deſire to knowe her euill, and to procure her remedy. But neither for any effect of Loue, nor hope of remedy that hee could giue her, would Niſa witnes any feeling of pleaſure, or obligation to him: all which ſerued to ſharpen Emilios deſires, which hee did make appeare with greater demonſtrations: whereat Niſa being grieued, endeauoured to diuert him from her Loue, coniuring him with teares, that hee would not leade her in this indecent habite. The Earle being curteous, offered her other cloathes, but ſhee aſſured him, that ſhe had made a vowe neuer to were any but Pilgrimes of this faſhion, vntill ſhe had ſeene the Patron of Spaine in Galicia. Emilio neuertheles did make her one of Serge in the ſame Golle,
               
for Serge, and Taylers are neuer wanting, fewe men comming into ſuch places, who doe not quickly proue Taylers. So the Pilgrim being new cloathed appeared more beautifull, there being no new apparell which doth not imbelliſh; nor ſo poore a habite new, which doth not inrich a well proportioned body.
            But by this time, a great fogge with a tempeſtious winde ariſing in the gulph, the Marryners knew by the ſignes, which are wont to fore-runne ſuch ſtormes, that they were likely to vndergoe a great hazard of drowning. Their preſage was not vaine, for the winde riſe with ſuch extremity and violence, and the Sea wrought with ſuch huge Billoes, that the Maſters could no more commaund, nor the Rowers abay. The Captaine was aſtoniſhed, the Pilot pale, ſome cryed, others ſilent and without ſtirring, remained as men in a Trance with feare. And in this confuſion, which continued ſixe houres, the miſerable Galley ſplit againſt the Rockes; Emilio who now no more remembred his Loue, and who knew not that the vnfortunatenes of Niſa brought forth this effect, (cleane contrary vnto Caeſars Fortune, which appeaſed ſtormes) indeauoured to ſaue his life with much trauaile: And the Heauen reſeruing Niſa's life to runne greater fortunes, caſt her as formerly ſhee had beene vpon the ſhore of Barcelon.
            
            Thoſe which remained aliue, were caſt away in the ſame place: Niſa hauing ſtayed ſome time to recouer herſelfe after this fortune, went in Pilgrimage to Marſelles: where one day viſiting the famous Temple of the Penitent, whome the Angels buryed in the Mountaine, where God gaue his Lawes to Moſes, ſhe ſawe a woman

a Pilgrim as herſelfe, though in other habite, who with great Deuotion was vpon her knees, at the ſtayres of the great Altar: Shee appeared vnto Niſa to bee a Spaniard, wherefore deſiring better to informe herſelfe, obliged thereunto, by her loue vnto the Countrey, ſhee ſtayed at the Gate, whereat (when hauing done her deuotions) ſhe came forth, and Niſa ſaluting her, they both knewe that they were Caſtelians: their ioy was ſo great, that it had beene confirmed by imbracings, if the mans apparell which Niſa wore, had not hindred it: by little and little they went apart, that they might ſpeake more freely, and with leſſe feare of the French, who already began to behold their beauties: and being placed vnder a Rocke which was adioyning vnto the Sea, Niſa ſaid thus vnto her, of what Prouince are you faire Spaniard? of the Kingdome of Toledo (anſwered the Pilgrim) and of the greateſt Citty, hauing merited to lodge the Kings for many yeares: you are then of Madreele, replyed Niſa, and ſo wee are heere met by chance two Pilgrims of one Countrey, for I am alſo of Toledo. Then ſaid the Pilgrim, fetching a great ſigh: There was borne the cauſe of my peregrination, and of my misfortune. It is eaſie to bee ſeene in thy youth and in thy beauty, that Loue hath brought you into theſe partes; and if it bee of a Gentleman of whome thou doſt complaine, I beleeue I know him. It may be ſo ſaid the Pilgrim of Madreele, and beleeue me ſo ſoone as I ſaw you I was abaſhed, becauſe you haue the very countenance of my enemy; you wiſh mee euill by all circumſtance, then ſaid Niſa: rather all good replyed the Pilgrim; for all that reſembleth his body is agreable vnto me, onely

I complaine of the cruelty of his minde; will you not tell me his name or his Parents, ſaid Niſa? I hazard a ſmall matter in telling thee that, anſwered ſhee; For contrariwiſe I gaine thus much, that it ſeemeth vnto me I am quiet and at peace, hauing ſeene thee, which ſince I loſt him neuer came vnto me before now. His name is Celio, and the name of a Siſter which he hath is Niſa, which are the beſt tokens I can giue thee, to make him known vnto thee; becauſe beſides, that ſhee is famous for her beauty, ſhee is alſo more famous for her diſgrace. Niſa remained aſtoniſhed to heare her owne name, & her brother Celios (for this Pilgrim was Finia, Pamphilus his Siſter, who had bin left in France, as you haue already heard) wherefore ſhe deſired earneſtly to know the particuler of this ſtory, which Finia related in the ſame māner as Celio▪
                had done vnto Pamphilus. In the City of Valence, accuſing his iealouſie, which had made him cruelly kill a French Gentleman, from whoſe death enſued his abſence, and all the miſeries & trauels which ſhee had ſince endured; Niſa diſſembling that part which ſhee had in the ſtory, blamed the cruelty of her brother Celio, and with the contentment, which ſhe receiued in ſeeing Pamphilus his Portraiture, in Finia her beauty, ſhe tempered her griefe for his abſence, and her ſorrow which ſhe had, that both their Parents ſhould looſetheir Children for one cauſe: then did ſhee tell her that ſhe knew Pamphilus, and that it was not long ſince ſhe ſaw him, aſſuring her (as one verily beleeuing) that hee was in Spaine: Finia demaunded of Niſa how ſhe knew him, and where it was that ſhe had ſeene him? And Niſa becauſe ſhe would not diſcouer herſelfe, told

her, that ſhe had knowne him at Conſtantinople, where they had been both Slaues together: Finia burſting into teares, imbraced Niſa, and coniured her to tell her name, and the ſtory of her Brother if ſhee knew it: Niſa anſwered, that Pamphilus himſelfe had heretofore in his captiuity tolde it vnto her, and that ſhe would willingly recount it vnto her: but firſt, ſhee deceiued Finia in telling her, that her name was Felix, and that going from Toledo with a Captaine, who imbarked in Carthagena, they had beene made Captiues in paſſing to Oran, and afterwards had to Argier, where a Turke of Conſtantinople had bought her. And ſo following the ſtory of Pamphilus which was alſo hers, from the beginning as you haue heard related by Celio vntill their departure from Toledo, ſhe began to ſay, as followeth.
            
               Heere followeth the Story of Pamphilus and Niſa.
               
               AFter that Pamphilus went away from Toledo with Niſa, thinking that her Father would marry her with another, and being iealous of himſelfe, hee tolde me that ſuffering ſome of thoſe diſcommodities, which doe offer themſelues vnto ſuch men, as trauaile without their lawfull Wiues, they came vnto Ciuill a beautifull Citty, if the Sunne doe ſhine vpon any, for riches, greatnes, magnificence, pollicy, hauen, and ſtaple of the Indyes: where it may be ſaid, that twice euery yeare, there entreth the ſubſtance of all Spaine. There would Pamphilus inioy the beautyes of Niſa; but ſhee diſconted, that hee loſt the reſpect which he was accuſtomed to beare to her Chaſtity, againſt the Oath

which hee had ſolemnly ſworne, hid himſelfe for ſome dayes out of his ſight, during which time, hee ready to growe mad; yet finding her againe, and crauing pardon with new Oathes to keepe the firſt inuiolably, they were friends againe.
               But Pamphilus being one day at the Market place, he was knowne by a Marchant of Toledo, a great friend vnto Niſa her Father, who going about to lay hands on him and apprehend him, Pamphilus was inforced to lay hand vpon his Sword, to defend himſelfe from the Iuſtice. It happened well for Pamphilus, whoſe courage and addreſſe in Armes is incredible, and accompanied with an admirable force; He was neuerteleſſe conſtrained to depart ſpeedily from Ciuill. And hee thinking it diſcommodious for him, to lead Niſa with him in her womans Apparell, he cloathed her in a ſute of his, and cutting off her hayre (of which hee after made great reliques, he girt a ſword to her ſide, and ſo they went to Lisbone together; but they were hardly accommodated in their Lodging, when as a Captain, and a great friend vnto Liſard, Niſa her elder Brother, who is now in Flanders) had aduertiſement of their comming. Although Niſa were ſufficiently diſguiſed, yet her countenance (to thoſe who had formerly ſeene her) being ſufficiently knowne, would eaſily diſcouer that which they did ſo carefully endeauour to hide.
               But their good fortune (which deliuered them from theſe dangers, it may bee to reſerue them to greater) would at that time, wherein the Captaine and his friends came to ſearch for Pamphilus, that Niſa was alone in the lodging, of whome hauing inquired her name

and her maſters, ſhee ſaid, ſhe was a Boy who ſerued Pamphilus of Luxan a Knight & of Madreele, not thinking that it did import to tell his name in a ſtrange Countrey. The Captaine neuer informed himſelfe farther for what he ſought; but his enſigne, inquired newes of Niſa; whereat ſhee being troubled, and repenting that ſhe had ſaid any thing of Pamphilus, anſwered that ſhee was gone by Sea with Pamphilus, to refreſh themſelues as farre as Belen, a famous Monaſtery and the ancient Sepulcher of the Kinges of Portingall. This ſo daine lye of Niſa ſaued Pamphilus his life, or at the leaſt the honour of both thoſe Louers: For the Soldiers went preſently to the Hauen attending there for their returne; And the Captaine accounting them already taken, and liking Niſa her faſhion, behauiour and countenance, exceeding well, intreated her to become his Page, aſſuring her that hee would vſe her better, then any that euer had worne his Caſſaque: Niſa ſeemed to yeeld with great willingnes, if hee pleaſed to accept of his ſeruice, and diſſembling the care and feare, which ſhee had of Pamphilus his life, ſaid vnto the Captaine, that hauing ſpoken with her Maſter, and giuen him an account of ſuch Iewels and other thinges as were in his cuſtody, hee would not fayle to come to him; with this anſwer the Captain and the Soldiers were hardly gone out of the doores, when Pamphilus came out of the Towne to his Loding, little thinking his enemies were ſo neare him: what helpe doe ſtrange Countries bring vnto thoſe, vnto whome misfortunes are euer domeſticke? Niſa told him the danger which threatned him, and Pamphilus hauing recourſe vnto the remedy, tooke

a ſpeedy reſolution to leaue Spaine. Niſa promiſed him to follow him through Seas & Lands, (how vnknowne ſoeuer) and a Portingall Knight, who had a Company in Cent offered to conduct him.
               
                  Cent is a frontiere Tower of the Moores in Africke, not farre from Tetuan, and as it were placed to confront Gibralter, as the vttermoſt bound of Europe: by which place it is ſaid the Moores entred, who vnder the leading of Iulian conquered Spaine. There remained our two Louers for ſome time in great peace; although Pamphilus diſcontent, to ſee his deſires denyed by Niſa her chaſt reſolution, had no great quietnes in his owne minde. Hee would haue marryed her, but it was not poſſible to perſwade Niſa vnto it; ſhe thinking it would bee a great diſparagement vnto her honour, for her to be marryed in this manner: And then when he ſeemed with reaſon to perſwade her; ſhee contradicted him with teares, remonſtrating that ſhee was his, and that true loue had a reſpect vnto an honeſt end, whereas hee who propounded vnto himſelfe onely delight, differed little from a Beaſt. Pamphilus curſed theſe reaſons of Niſa, and ſometimes out of griefe, would goe a whole day and not ſpeake vnto her, vntill in the end ouercome with her ſweet patience, hee was conſtrayned to ſend a thouſand ſighes as imbaſſadors for a peace vnto her, who had the empire ouer him.
               Now the noble courage of this young Knight, ſeeing himſelfe amongſt ſo many braue Soldiers, who went euery day to the warres againſt the Moores, did beleeue that it was a diſhonour vnto his birth, to carry a Sword idle by his ſide, whileſt others bathed theirs in

their enemies blood; wherefore one morning from the watch Towers, the Bels and Trumpets giuing the allarum, incited by his owne generoſity, and with the diſdaines, wherewith Niſa in his opinon had diſgraced him three or foure dayes before, hee went forth armed at all points, hauing a red Scarfe vpon his left arme, a white Feather vpon his helme, and a mountaine of ſnowe vpon his Shield; from the top of which, as from Mount Gibell in Scicily came a mouth of fire. So went Pamphilus out vpon his bay Horſe, which had a blacke mayne, and a blacke tayle, and a white ſtarre in the forehead, filling the Portugals with admiration, to ſee with what addreſſe hee managed him; and how gracefully he bore his Launce; but Niſa her euill fortune, or his owne deſperate reſolution who prayed at his departure that ſhee might not ſee him returne aliue, ſuffered the Battaile to bee ordered in ſuch manner that day, that the Chriſtians had the worſt; and Pamphilus ſearching death, brake into a Squadron of Moores, where being wounded and ouerthrowne, he was taken and led priſoner vnto Feſſe.
               
               The newes of this accident came ſpeedily vnto Niſa her eares, for the report of euill ſucceſſes come ſooner to the eares of Louers then that of happy euents: what her griefe was it is not neceſſary to expreſſe, otherwiſe then in repreſenting Niſa, farre from her Parents, out of her owne Countrey, and from any friends, and which was moſt, from the deare preſence of him, for whoſe ſake ſhee had quited all theſe, and for whoſe loſſe ſhee was almoſt out of her wits. But as the greateſt incounters of fortune, doe ſometime, bring forth the greateſt

ſtrength and courage of the minde; ſo Niſa her griefe rayſed in her weake and womanly minde ſuch valiant vertue, that ſhe boldly thruſt herſelfe into the acquaintance and friendſhip of a Moore, who with a ſafe conduct trafficked in Cent: him ſhee ſo farre gained with her affability and preſence, that hee lead her with him to Feſſe vnder the habite of an Alarbe, he teaching her in fewe dayes the greateſt part of the Language (of which ſhee was not altogether ignorant before) Niſa thus liued in Feſſe in the habite of a Moore, and vnder the name of Nephew vnto this Barbarian, who charmed with her vnderſtanding, gentlenes of ſpirit, and gracefull behauiour, indeauoured to perſwade her to leaue our Religion, promiſing to giue him his Daughter with the beſt part of his eſtate, which was exceeding much. Niſa did not refuſe him, neuertheles ſhe intreated him, that he would firſt ſuffer her to bee inſtructed in the Law, that ſhee might receiue it with more aſſurance, and more quietnes of minde. With theſe wordes; and with her beauty, Niſa grewe abſolute maſter of this Moore, of his women, (wherein they abound) of Lela Axa his Daughter, of his goods, his ſlaues, and his Horſes: vpon which, as ſhee rid vp and downe the Towne for her pleaſure, ſhe was almoſt adored by theſe Barbarians. She called herſelfe Azan Rubin, amongſt them, a name which Alijaffer had giuen her in memory of his Sonne, in whoſe place he accounted of her, ſaying that ſhee was his Portrature. Amongſt Alijaffers ſlaues, there was one Spaniard, with whom Niſa hauing many times ſpeech, ſhe intreated him, that he would inquire ſecretly, with whom a ſlaue of the Kingdome of Toledo liued;

and whoſe name was Pamphilus? This man informed himſelfe the ſame day; and following her, when ſhee was alone, he tolde her, that Saly Morato had taken him in a Battaile which was fought in Cent, and had him ſtill in his power, with other Slaues who ſerued the Maſons about the houſe, which he was building: Niſa glad of theſe newes, in the euening got on Horſebacke, Cloathed in a Scarlet Caſque, layd about with golde Lace, hauing a Hat vpon her head imbroadered with Pearle, and a great Feather, and a rich Sword of Tunis hanging in a Scarfe by her ſide: In this manner ſhe went into the ſtreet, where Saly Morat dwelt; and ſawe (in a newe houſe which was there a building) her miſerable (but beloued Pamphilus, not yet fully healed of his wounds, hauing a poore dublet of courſe Canuas, & breeches of the ſame, without ſhooes vpon his feet, & carying with another Chriſtian, the materials wherewith that houſe was to be built; ſhe ſtayed not (as ſhe had thought) becauſe that ſeeing him in this eſtate, the teares which ſhe ſhed, would haue diſcouered her; but feyning to turne her horſe in the ſtreet, & the beams of her face properly reſembling them of the Sun) hau
                     •
                  ng ſcattred the cloudes of this water, ſhe ſtayed, looking vpon theſe ſlaues, and ſaid vnto Pamphilus in the Language of Feſſe, why doth Morato build this fayre houſe, hauing another in this ſtreete ſo fayre? Pamphilus anſwered (according to his knowledge) that they were for the keeping of ſlaues, becauſe that ſince his good ſucceſſe in the former war, he was growne proud, and did preſage that hee ſhould haue many. Thou art then his ſlaue, ſaid ſhee, in the Caſtillian tongue. Pamphilus anſwered, that by his miſfortune

he was brought to that eſtate, and earneſtly beholding her face, let fall to the ground that which hee held in his hand. Wondering to ſee a Moore which ſhould ſo perfectly reſemble his beloued Niſa: for that this ſhould be ſhee, he could not perſwade himſelfe, by reaſon of her Language, her habite, and the ſmall time ſince that he left her in Cent: ſo hee remained without ſpeaking, indeuouring to couer his aſtoniſhment and confuſion by his ſilence: When as ſhee ſpeaking vnto him in the Arabian tongue, asked of him if hee were a Knight? Pamphilus more aſſured that it was Niſa, by the reſemblance of her face, & diſtruſting it was not ſhe by her language, hearing her ſpeak the language of Feſſe ſo naturally, anſwered her. I told Saly Morato that I was a poore man, but becauſe you reſemble ſo much a Maſter which heretofore I had (vnto whom I neuer lied in my life) I will not deceiue you. I am a Caſtillian Knight, and of the Kingdome of Toledo, & of a place, whereof it is not poſſible but you ſhould haue heard, becauſe that the names of Princes Courts are notorious to all Nations, as Paris in France, Rome in Italy, Conſtantinople in Greece; and Madreele in Spaine; there was I borne, ſubiect vnto this misfortune wherein you ſee me. But gentle Moore, I pray tell me, who you are, & why you aske of me my Country and my quallitie? I am ſaid Niſa, Nephew vnto the gouernor Alijaffer, & ſon vnto Muley Nuzan his brother, by a Chriſtian ſlaue; who was borne in Toledo: my name is Hazan Rubin, although that heretofore I called my ſelfe by my mothers name, Ceuill Mendoſſa: my vncles ſon being dead, hee ſent for me to Moroco, the place of my birth, from whence he brought me

hether, and to comfort himſelfe called me by the name of his ſonne; promiſing me to marry me vnto Lela Axa his Daughter, who is the fayreſt in all Affrique, and this is the reaſon which inciteth me to loue Chriſtians (who are well borne) becauſe my mother was one; eſpecially Spanyards and of her owne Country: and it greeues me extreamely that thou art belonging to this gouernor, who is reputed to vſe his ſlaues hardly, as it may be ſeen by experiēce in thy ſelfe, who being ſuch, that thy nobilitie doth manifeſtly appeere, notwithſtanding the miſery and pouerty of thy clothes, yet doth put thee to ſuch vile labor. Wherfore as well becauſe thou pleaſeſt me well, as for the reaſons which I haue tolde thee, I will bring it to paſſe, if thou thinke good of it, that Alijaffer ſhall buy thee, and in his houſe there ſhalbe nothing wanting vnto thee but thy liberty; as for all other things I will vſe thee as my ſelf. Pamphilus at theſe words caſt himſelfe at her feet, & by force did many times kiſſe them, thanking her for the fauour which ſhee did him.
               So being departed, Niſa told Alijaffer the deſire which ſhee had vnto a Spaeniſh ſlaue, who was euill entreated of Saly Morato; the Moor who deſired to oblige him abſolutely, and to ſatiſfie his pleaſure in all things, went the next morning to Salye Morato; to treate with him about the ſale of this ſlaue; which being not refuſed vnto him, they talked of the price: Salye demaunded a thouſand Duckets, becauſe (ſayeth he) he had beene taken in good equipage, both for Armes and Horſe, and a red Scarfe vpon his left arme, a thing which (he ſayed) in the time of his being in Spayne he had ſeene in Kings Portratures: Niſa who was moſt intereſſed

at the bargaine, ſayed vnto him that in Spayne, cloathes were common, and the pride of Soldiers equall vnto the Maieſtie of their Princes: In the end they agreed vpon fiue hundred Duckets, and Niſa going vnto the chamber, where Pamphilus laye, tooke him along with her; hee filled with teares, and imaginations, attributing this kindnes to the reſemblance which was between the Moore and Niſa, and oftentimes he reſolued to beleeue that it was ſhe; For although the habit and tongue diſguiſed her, yet the voyce & countenance diſcouered her. She lodged him in a place, differing and better then that of the ſlaues: ſhe cauſed him incontinently to bee cloathed, and going to ſee him the firſt night; ſhee brought him one of her Smocks, intreating him to weare it vnder his: Pamphilus caſt himſelfe at her feete, and Niſa turning herſelfe away, hee humbly kiſſed the ground which ſhee had trodden vpon, But they had not long talked together, when as Pamphilus grewe ſo certaine, that if ſhe was not Niſa he was mad; that thereby he could not ſleepe, he could not eate, nor doe any other thing, but ſhew her his thoughts in the violence of ſighes: Niſa fearing that in this perplexity he might looſe his wits; to aſſure him, and thereby to know the ſecret of his heart, vttered theſe wordes one day vnto him; Pamphilus the Loue which I beare thee, conſtrained me to procure thy good, and to ſolicite thy reſt: I tolde Alijaffer that I ſtood much affected vnto thee, and he anſwered me, that if I would hee would ſend thee into thy Country, that thou ſhouldſt goe vpon thy worde, and that from thence thou ſhouldſt vpon thy honour, ſend him that which thou oweſt him.

But I who looſe my life in looſing thee, haue intreated him to giue thee my Siſter Fatima to wife, & that thereby I doubted not but I ſhould perſwade thee to alter thy Religion and become a Moore; If thou canſt bee contented to doe this for me, I ſhall knowe thy gentlenes, and thou ſhalt inioy the beautifulleſt Gentlewoman in all Morocco, & ſhalt be one of the richeſt men of all Africke, becauſe that beſides what my Father left her, my Vnckle will giue her a great part of his eſtate alſo, and I will giue thee mine, and my wife and I will ſoiourne vnder thy gouernment.
               
                  Pamphilus, whoſe intent was to make her diſcouer herſelfe vnto him, or elſe to nettle Niſa ſo farre, as that ſhe ſhould declare herſelfe; coldely anſwered, that to obay her, and to requite the duty which hee ought her, he would willingly become a Moore; aſwell for that reaſon, as alſo that hee had ſeene Fatima ſometimes in the Bathes; of whome he was growne ſo amorous, that the little pleaſure and leſſe health which he had, proceded from thence. Hardly had Niſa heard Pamphilus his reſolution, when in an extreame fury ſhee ſaid vnto him, Ah perfidious Traytor, and barbarous enemy: without God, without faith, without loue, without loyalty; Is this that which thou oweſt vnto Heauen, to thy Parents, to thy Country, and to the vnfortunate and miſerable Niſa? who to deliuer thee, hath put herſelfe into ſuch great dangers? I knewe well my moſt beloued Niſa anſwered Pamphilus, (imbracing her) that this ſubtilty was neceſſary, for to make thee diſcouer thine; for thou gouerneſt thy ſelfe in ſuch manner, that before thou wouldſt haue otherwayes plainely declared thy

ſelfe vnto me, I ſhould haue loſt my wits, if not my life. Let goe my Arme ingratefull wretch ſayd Niſa; vſe no more theſe ſubtleties, hauing diſcouered ſo much perfideous weaknes; but wretch that I am, why doe I complaine? ſeeing that he who forſaketh God, doth not iniure me, in forſaking me: But in the end after many ſorrowfull complaints, his ſatisfactions had ſuch vertue, that her anger being ouercome by her loue, they remained friends, with more pleaſure, and firmnes then euer, as it alwayes happens vnto true Louers.
               This day paſſed away, followed with many others, during which time, they entred into deliberations of the meanes, whereby they might recouer their libertie; which ſeemed to them impoſſible in reſpect of the loue which Alijaffer bare vnto Niſa, as alſo in reſpect of the loue which Fatima bare vnto Pamphilus; for ſhe hauing heard that he would be a Moor & that his Vncle would marry her vnto him, fauoured him, to Niſas great griefe who vpon this iealouſie, was for the ſpace of three moneths without any louing correſpondency with him: Behold an vnheardoff ſtory! wherein is to be ſeene what a woman (who loueth) can effect; ſeeing ſhe deceaued the diſtruſt of an old Moore, and brought all his houſe to that poynt that all things were gouerned by the onely will of Pamphilus: who taking better councell, whileſt Alijaffer was gone vnto Tarndan where the King lay at that time; wrought ſo hanſomely, with Axa and Fatima, that they would goe into Spaine with him, vpon the remonſtrance, which he made vnto them, that his loue was certaine and aſſured, and theirs deceitfull, falſe and not to be beleeued: they were not hard to be

perſwaded, becauſe they were women, Moores, and Louers; three thinges of weake reſiſtance.
               So one faire night, hauing packed vp all the beſt Iewels they could finde, they got all foure to Horſe-backe, and Pamphilus being clad in the like apparell vnto Niſa, that thereby they might paſſe more ſurely, they came vnto Cent, where being ioyfully receiued by the Generall, hee accommodated them with Shipping for Liſbon. There he let Axa and Fatima vnderſtand, that it was neceſſary for them to goe to Rome, that the chiefe and holy Biſhop might receiue them into the Church, and pardon them himſelfe: all which they did the ſooner to get out of Spaine; they being contented to follow them whether ſoeuer they would goe, imbarqued themſelues all together in a Ship of Aragon, which had brought in Wheate, and hauing a faire winde they arriued in Sicilie, from whence becauſe it was the yeare of Iubile, they went all foure in the habite of Pilgrims to Rome. There Axa and Fatima were Baptized, Axa was called Clement of his Holines his name, and Fatima was called Hipolita, from her Godmother. The Marriage was reſting ſtill, to be performed according to promiſe. But Pamphilus and Niſa entertained them alwayes with hope, remonſtrating vnto them, that it was not fit nor iuſt, that they ſhould bee marryed, before they came vnto their Fathers houſe. So after they had ſeene great part of Italy and France, and from thence they paſſed into Spaine, where they thought that Niſa her Parents choller was by this time ouer, for when thefts in Loue are not chaſticed vpon the act in warme blood, they are alwayes remitted with time. But hauing ru
                     •
                  ne a dangerous

Fortune in a miſerable Tartane, into which they had imbarked themſelues at A Towne of Sauoy.
                  Villa Franca, and hauing beene long beaten with a ſore tempeſt, they finiſhed their ſhipwracke within the ſight of the walls of Barcelon, neither is knowne, whether Niſa and the Moores are aliue or dead: But Pamphilus ſwimming, attained vnto a plancke of the Ship, and within a day after, being taken vp by ſome Moores of Byſerta, they carryed him to Cenſtantinople where I ſawe him a Captiue, and where hee tolde me what I haue related.
               This Niſa added vnto the truth, to hide herſelfe from Finia, knowing already by that which was related in the firſt Booke, how ſhee and Pamphilus were both taken vp halfe Drowned, one by the Fiſhers, and the other by Captaine Doricles, with their ſeuerall ſucceſſes in their Perigrinations in Spaine, vntill they met together amongſt the Mad-men in the Hoſpitall of Valence. Finia thanked her much for the newes which ſhee had tolde her of her Brother, ſhewing ſome griefe for the Death of Niſa; afterwards hauing concluded their returne into Spaine, they retired themſelues together to Marſelles, where they reſted for ſome dayes, Finia beleeuing alwayes that Niſa was this Felix, whoſe name ſhee had borrowed.
               In the meane time, miſerable Pamphilus ſuffered in Priſon, with more rigorous paine then he did before, becauſe that his fury increaſing with his griefe, hee was kept ſo much the more ſtraightly, by how much he was thought to bee the more mad. In the eud Iacinth came vnto Valence, and being aduertiſed by Pamphilus, of his misfortune, hee drewe him out of the Cage, and

had him to his houſe, ſaying that his Parents had ſent him Fiue hundred Crownes of Caſtreele, to defray the charge of his Cure at his houſe; All thoſe who remained in the Hoſpitall, were ſorry, becauſe vntill that time, there was neuer ſeene a Mad-man ſo wiſe, nor a wiſe man which did imagine ſo many follyes. There did Pamphilus take againe his ancient habite, and being departed from Iacinth and his Siſter, (in whome the wonderfulnes of his ſtory, rayſed no leſſe Loue then pitty:) tooke againe the ſecond time his way to Barcelon, where hee was no ſooner come, but he was met and knowne, by one of thoſe whome he had wounded in Mountſerrat: hee was then the ſecond time layde in Priſon, in the ſame place where two Almains his companions had remained vntill that time. A thing worthy of admiration in any vnderſtanding, that a man ſhould not be able to finde the clew whereby he might get out of ſo many Labyrinths; from Barcelon to Valence, and from Valence to Barcelon, in iourneying in a ſmall part of his Countrey, with more variable ſucceſſes then Eneas did in his voyage of Italy, or Vliſſes in that of Greece. Pamphilus ſawe there his friends with great griefe, and was receiued by them with great ioy. And Finia and Niſa comming from Marſelles by little and little ouer the craggy Mountaines, which diuide France from Spaine, came vnto Perpignan, where I leaue them to their reſt, attending the fourth Booke.
               The end of the Third Booke.
            
         
         
            
            The Fourth Booke.
            
               GReat is Loue amongſt the GODS, and amongſt Men meruailous (ſaith Phedrius in Plato: Heſiodus ſaieth, that the two firſt thinges which were ſeene after the Chaos, was Loue, and the Earth. Parmenides ſaith that he was ingendred before the Gods; preferring him in knowledge vnto the Father of the Muſes: And in Warre, before the god of Battayles; making this argument, that, that which detayneth is greater then that which is detayned; and that he is truly ſtrong, who vanquiſheth the ſtrong: He calls it the light of the vnderſtanding, & aſſureth that, that onely liueth in darknes which is not lightned with his fire. And among other attributes, he cals it the God of Peace, the Father of deſire, and the appetite of good; in the preſence of which the ſoule deſireth to be eternally: From whence it followeth, that Loue is a deſire of immortalitie, which reconcileth affections, giueth good will, taketh away hatred: Of the nature of this Loue, was that of our Pilgrims, at the leaſt Niſa'es, who being with Finta, departed from Perpignan, came with her into Barcelon, about that time, when the Sun hauing paſſed the middle of the day, deſcendeth towards the Weſt Indyes. But Fortune not yet weary with troubling and croſſing

them, ſhewed her, that the firſt were onely to be feared, in regarde of thoſe which were neceſſarily to followe: For as ſhe entred with Finia into the Cittie, a confuſed throng of people conſtrained them to ſtand in the middle of the ſtreet. Niſa deſirous to knowe vpon what occation ſuch a world of people was aſſembled; & ſeeing an Olde man, who related it vnto others, with pittie, ſhe intreated him (out of curteſie) to tell her: It is (Pilgrims my friends) ſaid the olde man, becauſe there is a Knight a Caſtillian going to haue his head cut off, for killing an officer of Iuſtice, who would haue apprehended him vpon ſuſpition of Theft, which he had not done, neere vnto Mountſerrat, whether he was going in Pilgrimage (as you peraduenture may doe:) But beſides the greatnes of his Crime, which is no leſſe then rebellion, he was found to haue in the hollowe of his Staffe, a Sworde longer then is permitted to be worne, by the Ordinances of this Kingdome:
            I am much grieued at it anſwered Niſa, for many reaſons; and principally, becauſe he is a Caſtillian; for as you may perceiue by my Tongue, this Pilgrim and I are both Caſtillians: It would more grieue you (ſaid the olde man) if you ſawe his Face and his proportion, accompanied with ſuch youth, that he doth not ſeem to be two and twenty yeares complete: Can you tell this Knights name ſaid Finia? one of my Sonnes ſaid the olde man, hath bene his Procter, and he tolde me he was called Pamphilus of Luxan, borne at Madreele which is a Citty ſufficiently known throughout all the world: With a pale and deadly countenance did the two Pilgrims beholde one the other, and burſting into teares,

as from two Fountaines, they imbraced and fell downe together. The good olde man wondring to ſee them thus ſuddenly oppreſſed, knewe that this Knights name had pierced to their ſoule; And incouraging them as much as poſſibly he could, he retyred them vnto the door of the next houſe, the better to auoyd the throng of people, which ſtayed at the rarenes of the accident; Niſa and Finia, hauing ſome time bewayled the miſerable Pamphilus, and ſaide vnto the olde man that he was their kinſ-man: They might ſee a man enter into the ſtreet, breaking through the preaſe of the people with his Horſe: which moued Niſa to intreat the olde man, to enquire what hee was, and vpon what occaſion hee made ſuch haſt through the company? who being informed, and comming againe, demaunded a rewarde for the good newes which hee brought. Hath Pamphilus his Pardon ſaid Finia? He whome you ſawe paſſe by anſwered the olde man, is a Knight of Valence, called Iacinth of Centilla's, who comming the other day into this Towne vpon ſome occaſion, knew Pamphilus, and withall vnderſtanding he was condemned to dye; tolde the Viceroy that this criminall perſon was a mad-man, and but newly gotten out of the Hoſpitall of Valence, as he offred to verifie: whereupon the Viceroy and the Iudge, willing to ſaue this young man, ſuſpended the Execution of his Iudgement, and gaue Commiſſion to this Knight to bring proofe of his affection; ſo much the rather beleeuing his wordes, by how much Pamphilus confeſſed his Crime and deſired to dye, with an extreame griefe: But the time expiring (which was giuen vnto Iacinth) for the verifying of Pamphilus madnes: he

was had towards the place of his Execution, and by the way, is met by Iacinth (as you haue ſeene) who hath brought with him ſ
                  •
               fficient proofe, and an expreſſe Commaund from the Viceroy, that he ſhall be had backe againe to Valence.
            
            Theſe newes reuiued Niſa and Finia, who hauing reſted themſelues there all that day, went the next day to ſee him in the Priſon; at the entrance whereof they found, that for a Mad-man hee was taken out and ſet vpon a Mule, to bee carryed to Valence. And euen vpon the inſtant, that Pamphilus lifting vp his eyes beheld his deare Niſa, and that ſhee aduanced herſelfe to ſpeake to him, came one of the ſeruants and apprehended Niſa, and his companions ceazing vpon Finia, put them both in Priſon: although Pamphilus cryed out that ſhe was his Brother, for being accounted for a Mad-man, hee was not hearkened vnto, but contrariwiſe becauſe he paſſionately caſt himſelf from his Mule vpon the ground; hee was with much cruelty tyed vpon his Mules backe, and with ſhrewde blowes ſet forward in his way; their opinion of his madnes being the more confirmed.
            I cannot forbeare wondring euery time I thinke of this mans misfortunes! hee came firſt to Barcelon to ſuffer at Valence all thoſe miſeries which you haue formerly heard. And now it ſeemeth, hee returneth that way againe a new to begin the ſame paines. The cauſe of Finia's and Niſa's apprehenſion, was that Niſa in regard of his apparell and of his ſhort hayre was thought to bee a man, and being alwayes in Finia's company, the Iuſtice tooke holde of them, out of a ſtrong ſuſpition

that they did liue lewdly and incontinently together, a thing which is often couered vnder the cloake of Pilgrimage, which makes it more odious, and frequent in that Countrey. Whatſoeuer might happen of it, Niſa would not diſcouer herſelfe notwithſtanding any feare of chaſtiſement: But defending her cauſe as a man, denyed that euer ſhee had ſo much as ſpoken otherwayes then with great honeſty and modeſty to Finia. Who accounting Niſa for a man, and beleeuing certainely that ſhe was the ſame Felix, whom ſhee fained to bee, with whoſe conuerſation and beauty ſhe was charmed, confeſſed ſimply her deſire, (for the effect was impoſſible) and although the honeſty of their conuerſation did appeare by both their Confeſſions, yet their beauty was a cruell witnes againſt their innocency.
            About this time came the afflicted (Celio by the mountaines of France, the principall Cittyes whereof he had ſought for his beloued Finia) backe to Barcelon, ſtill continuing his queſt, and onely to informe himſelfe if there were any Pilgrims of Caſteele; and hauing vnderſtood that there were two Priſoners but a fewe daies before, he went to ſee them, hoping to heare ſome newes, if not of Finia, at leaſt of the Countrey. His fortune would that hee ſhould firſt meete with her before he ſawe his Siſter Niſa, and being aduertiſed, that ſhee had beene taken with a young man, and layd vp for the ſuſpition that was had of their diſhoneſt Loue, Hee ſpake vnto her through an Iron-grate, which ſeperateth the mens Priſons from the womens.
            Is this O Finia, the confidence which I had of thy vertue ſo conſormable to the noblenes of thy blood?

Is it heere, (after hauing ſearched thee almoſt all France ouer, hauing meaſured ſtep by ſtep all the teadious plaines, and craggy mountaines, which did leade vnto any place, where there was either hope or likelihood to finde thee, vndergoing many notable dangers) that I ſhould thinke to finde thee in a publicke Priſon with a young man? Now are all my ſuſpitions confirmed, and my reaſons that I had to kill the Frenchman, for which I haue ſuffered ſo many trauailes: Is this the recompence of ſo many euils, which for thy ſake I haue endured? Doeſt thou thus requite thy obligations vnto mee? At the leaſt this comfort I haue, I may returne into my Countrey, with full aſſurance that I ſhall not incurre any infamy, neither in thy friends opinion nor in mine owne: for hauing left thee in this danger, and in thoſe which will vneuitably follow thee, ſeeing thou haſt found another, who accompanieth thee, honoreth thee, and defendeth thee. Thinke not, O vngratefull perſon, anſwered Finia in weeping, that I haue euer offended thee, for thou canſt not make mee ſuffer ſo much, that I would hazard that which thou haſt coſt me, for all the treaſure of the world: Thy Iealouſie made thee kill a man and leaue me alone, in ſuch a place; the difficulty of getting away from whence, conſidering my weakenes, may ſeeme a miracle. In my voyage I haue met with this man, who no leſſe innocent then chaſte Ioſeph, ſuffereth this vniuſt impriſonment, for hauing bin the moſt honeſt helper that I could haue deſired in thy abſence, as thou mayeſt plainely ſee by the modeſty of his countenance and his ſpeech, if thou pleaſeſt to ſpeake with him. To excuſe thy ſelfe anſwered Celio,
               
in ſo notorious a crime, is to moue me to greater anger, becauſe thou mayſt haue fayled as a Woman, but to deny it vnto me, and to ſay that thou haſt not done it, is a moſt euident token that thou wilt deceiue mee, either heere or in thy owne Countrey, (if euer thou returne thither) therefore I doe forbid thee for euer to dare to name me, or to ſay thou euer kneweſt me. So ſaid Celio, and turning his backe to Finia, left her in the greateſt griefe that a woman could ſuffer; which is in theſe accidents to looſe his preſence, vnder whoſe protection ſhe liues: eſpecially when it ſeemeth vnto her, that ſhee cannot hope for any other remedy or ſuccour. Celio hiding the teares which hee ſhed in going away, and conſulting with the fury of his Iealouſie, and his rage for the iniury which he did thinke hee had receiued, concerning the reuenge which hee ſhould take; wayted for Niſa's inlargement, that he might kill him. The Iudges although that the Priſoners innocency did ſufficiently appeare, yet would they not giue them liberty to returne together. (For thoſe doe ſeeme to permit the euill, which doe not forbid the occaſion) but retired Finia into a houſe, and commanded Niſa whom they called Felix, that, that day hee ſhould voyde the Citty of Barcelon. Niſa went then late in the euening out of the Towne, and farre from thinking that her Brother wayted to kill her, beleeuing her to bee the man, with whom Finca had ſo irreconciliably offended him: And the darkenes of the euening with the diſguiſe of mans Apparell which Niſa wore, depriued Celio's eyes, (already blinded with anger) from diſcerning her to be his Siſter Niſa, into whoſe body hee twice thruſt his

Sword, and had abſolutely killed her, if ſome paſſengers vpon the way at that time, had not, not onely hindred him, but alſo apprehended him and put him in Priſon.
            The miſerable Niſa, who then began to haue a greater feeling of her ſufferred miſeries, was carryed to an honourable Cittizens houſe of great compaſſion and charity, who hauing giuen order for her Dreſſing, and found that her wounds were not mortall, purſued Celio ſo eagerly in Iuſtice, informing the Iudges of the crime which hee himſelfe had ſeene him commit, that the third day after he was condemned to Death. Celio alledged in his defence, that Finia was his lawfull wife, and that hauing found her impriſoned with this young man for ſuſpition of incontinency, hee did not thinke that he had done euill, if hee had killed them both. Whereupon they ordered it, that Finia ſhould bee impriſoned againe; but ſhee hauing ſome notice thereof, preuented it by flight.
            On the other ſide, Pamphilus comming to Valence, recouered his liberty by Iacinths meanes; with an extreame contentment vnto Tiberia, vnto whome Pamphilus giuing thankes, for the care which ſhee had of him, raiſed in her a thouſand hopes which his abſence, and miſery had killed. Hee taketh leaue of her with many fayre and amorous wordes, and returning to Barcelon, went to ſeeke for his Deare Niſa in the Priſon, wherein hee had ſeene her ſhut, when he went away as a Mad-man.
            But when he found Celio there in her place, in ſuch extreame danger of his life, from whome (informing

him of the cauſe of his misfortune) he was tolde all the iniury, which Finia had don him with a Pilgrim, whom he had wounded, whereby he came to knowe that this man, whome Celio out of Iealouſie would haue killed, was his owne Siſter Niſa. And with the griefe of ſo vnhappy a newes, Pamphilus cryed out; O cruell Celio, thou haſt taken away the life of thy own Siſter, and my deare Wife, whome vnder this habit accompanied my Fortunes: and it may bee alſo my ſiſter Finia, for whoſe ſake thou haſt vniuſtly killed Niſa. I am Pamphilus thy enemy, vnto whome (not knowing of me) thou didſt recite the ſtory of thy Fortunes, who haue already pardoned the iniury which thou haſt done vnto my honour in rauiſhing away Finia, hauing conſideration of the iniury which I did thee in leading away Niſa.
            
            With leſſe griefe would Celio haue heard the ſentence of his Death, then the relation which Pamphilus made; for hee remayned ſo aſtoniſhed and ſilent, as if he had beene taken out of Priſon to goe to execution. Hee would haue iuſtified his innocency, but being not able to vtter one worde, hee remayned dumbe, and his hands and his feete without any motion, made him appeare as one vnſenſible. Pamphilus as almoſt mad, left him in the Priſon, and going vp and downe to enquire for Niſa, hee was accounted for a Mad-man by all thoſe who ſawe him, for they did remember that for a Mad-man hee was ſaued, being condemned to dye.
            
               Pamphilus hauing bene three or foure times at Iacinths houſe; Loue, to worke the greater confuſion, had augmented his Siſter Tiberia's deſires; who (as you haue heard) caſt her eyes vpon Pamphilus his beautie: hee

ouercome with the good turnes, & pittifull care which ſhe had of his misfortunes, had not rigorouſly intreated her thoughts: She, when this laſt time ſhe ſaw him returne to Barcelon, and that neither her prayers nor intreaties could ſtay him; writ vnto her Brother (who did accompany him in his Iourney) how that Pamphilus, out of the luſtfull courage of an ingratefull gueſt, had ſo farre forgotten himſelfe, as to moue Loue vnto her, and that ſhe, yielding vnto his perſwaſions, had imbarqued herſelfe, with more ſure gages, then, without the bonds of Mariage, did fit either with her honour, or the reputation of either of them.
            
               Iacinth angry at this euill correſpondency, and vngratefull acknowledgement of his Friendſhip, good turnes, and hoſpitallity, ſought Pamphilus, as earneſtly as he ſought Niſa, and hauing found him; led him out of the Towne vppon the ſhoare ſide, where he ſhewed him his Siſters Letter: Afterwardes (ſetting his hand vpon his Sworde) he ſaid, he would wiſh him to drawe his Sworde: now to offend him, that Sworde which formerly he had at Valence, drawne in his defence (although a trecherous fellow, as he was, did not deſerue to haue his Sworde meaſured with his. The innocent Pilgrime excuſed himſelfe, intreating him to let him ſearch out Niſa, whom (he ſaid) he had heard was ſore wounded, & that he wold not vpon the Lyes and indiſcretiō of a diſpiſed woman, hinder him in this buſines which did ſo neerly concerne him, as did the ſearching for his deere wife, who was in danger of loſing her life; and that he himſelfe was the moſt aſſured witnes, how much paine, labour and danger Niſa had coſt him; the

onely thoughts of whome, had kept him from taking pleaſure in any other thing: Theſe excuſes did not ſatisfie Iacinth, becauſe the opinion which he had conceaued of his Siſter Tiberia's vertues, did darken in his vnderſtanding, the light of all Pamphilus his reaſons: who out of the many Obligations, againſt his honour and condition, ſuffred Iacinths iniurious wordes. But in the end, ſeeing him threaten him, with his Sworde in his hand, calling him baſe Coward, Runnagate, and many other inſupportable Inſolencies; he drewe his Sworde to ſtay his Enemies, and with a poynt nimbly running vpon him, ouerthrewe him to the ground, if not dead, yet at leaſt ſo neere dead, that he ſeemed ſo. Pamphilus moſt grieuouſly deteſting his moſt outragious fortune, took him vp in his armes & caried him into the towne, the one ſhedding his blood, & the other his teares; and finding ſtrong life in him, he perſuaded him of the truth of his innocency, leauing him at a Church doore (whether the people flocked apace to ſee him, knowing that he was wounded.) And without inquiring any further of Niſa, he went once againe out of Barcelon, although much more ſad; for he left his beſt friend whome he had ſorely wounded with his owne hand, and his deereſt Friend neere the hands of death.
            
               Iber ſo called of Iberia, an ancient Cittie of that Kingdome (ſometimes very rich) not farre from that place where Scipio vanquiſhed the Cartheginians, and as Titus Liuius affirmeth, ioyned Spayne vnto the Roman Empire, running from two Fountaines, batheth the fields of the Cantabrians and the Celtiberians (it taking his name from the Celtes which came out of France, and from the Prouince

of Iberia, no leſſe rich and fruitfull then thoſe which of the ſame name are called Iberian, neare the Mountaine Caucaſas, hauing aboundance of Golde within their Veynes. This famous flood according vnto Pliny, riſeth neare vnto the ancient Iuliobrica, and after many windings and turnings commeth to waſh the walles of Sallibinum, which Caeſar called Caeſar Auguſtus, and the iniury of times Saragoſſa.
            
            At the courſe of theſe Chriſtaline waters, Pamphilus ſtayed his flight, ſitting downe vpon the bancke of the Riuer, which began to ſwell with his teares, ſo pittifull to behold, that the very windes did ſeeme to condole with him in his complaints by their dolefull noyſe, amongſt the leaues of the Trees, and the Birdes warbling out their woes. There was not any thing of life, which had not ſome ſhewe of ſorrow with him, vnleſſe it were the Fiſhes, which being dumbe, did not put forth their heads out of their cleare waters at the importunity of other voyces, yet their ſilence did ſeeme to ioyne with him in ſorrow. Is it poſſible ſaid he, that the feare of looſing this vnprofitable Life, ſhould haue more power ouer me, then the duties which I owe, vnto my birth and vnto my Miſtres? How comes it to paſſe, that not to looſe a thing, ſo vile in my eyes, ſo heauy to my ſoule, and ſo grieuous to my ſuffering, I haue loſt the moſt eſteemed of my vnderſtanding, the moſt honored of my memory and the moſt adored of my will? It is thou faire Niſa, who ouer the ſharpe Mountaines of Toledo, didſt couragiouſly followe my ſteps, from their higheſt tops euen vnto the ſandes of the Spaniſh Sea: thou art ſhee, who in the Battaile of Cent didſt

bitterly bewayle my Captiuity: art not thou O my Deare Niſa ſhee, who vnder the habit of a Moore and vnder the name of Hazan Ruben, dreweſt mee from the Kingdome of Feſſe, and from the Captiuity of Sali Morata? Wert not thou caſt away with me at Sea, in our returne from Italy within the view of Barcelon walles, and whom the Sea caſt vp on the ſhore, as vnworthy to poſſeſſe ſo rich a Pearle? Didſt not thou liue afterwards a long time amongſt the Mad-men as depriued of thy reaſon, with the very griefe of my Death? didſt not thou ſuffer new Shipwracke at Marſelles? And finally wounded by thy iealous Brother lyeſt now in a ſtrange Countrey either ſicke or dead? Seeing all this is ſo, how can I apprehend the leaſt motion of leauing thee? Where is my courage or am I not Pamphilus of Luxan? Is this the vertuous blood of thoſe valiant Gouernors, who ſo nobly defended the walles of Madreele, from the Moores of Toledo? It is not poſſible! I am not my ſelfe, my misfortunes haue changed me into ſomething elſe. To bee in Loue and to be a Coward is a manifeſt contrariety: yet to deny that I Loue, is to ſay the Sun is darkenes, and the night Lightnes, eſpecially ſince I cannot ſay, but that I haue ſeene Niſa. But ſeeing I doe confeſſe that I haue ſeene her, how can I ſay but that I loue her? And if I loue her, how can I leaue her? And if I haue left her, wherefore doe I liue?
            So did Pamphilus accuſe himſelfe for hauing left Niſa for any danger; no more nor no leſſe, then as one who trauailing vpon the way remembreth ſomething of importance which he had forgotten at home, breaking off from his diſcourſe and from his company, turneth back

againe to his lodging, where hee thinkes he ſhall neuer come time enough; with the ſame haſt Pamphilus taketh his way back again to Barcelon, from which both in haſt and feare he had departed. A ſtrong chayne of Louers, which tyed to their deſired beauty, ſhortens it ſelfe by the force which lengthens it, vntill it returne vnto its centure. Beauty without doubt, which lifting vp the vapors of the Louers eyes, ſeemeth to drawe vnto its ſelfe the very waighty and earthy part, in deſpite of all reſiſtance made by the naturall waight, and as the Sun oftentimes conuerteth into burning beames, the humor which is concealed in the Clouds; ſo Beauty conuerteth into fire all the teares and ſadneſſes of Louers.
            Fewe Leagues had Pamphilus iourneyed from the famous Collony of the Romans, when as going downe a Hill, it being ſo late, as that the Sunne had left no light in the Weſt, but as it were a golden girdle; which inuironing the Horizon, did ſeeme as a Crowne vnto the neighbouring night: hee heard a voyce grieuouſly complaining in a Meadow, which ſhadowed with high Rockes, was very darke.
            The couragious Pilgrim went into it, and ſawe a man lying vpon the Graſſe, amongſt the Trees which were watered with a freſh Brooke, of whome demaunding the cauſe of his complaint; hee intreated him to come vnto him, if he deſired to knowe, before he yeelded vp his ſoule, cauſed by three mortall woundes which were made in his body. Pamphilus approached vnto him although with ſome diſtruſt, and lifting him vp leaned his head againſt a Tree. I am a Knight ſaid the wounded man; treacherouſly murthered by his

hands▪ who hath receiued moſt good turnes from mee. There is a Monaſtery in theſe fields which is not farre from hence, if thou canſt carry me vpon thy ſhoulders thither, thou ſhalt bee the Encas of my ſoule, and I the Anchiſes, ſaued peraduenture from the eternall Fire which I haue merited. Pamphilus layde downe his Palmers ſtaffe (oh how hurtfull it is to leaue ones weapons vpon any occaſion whatſoeuer) taking him in his armes; And remembring that he had ſo carryed Iacinth; hee thought with himſelfe, that ſeeing he was come to carry others vnto the Graue, hee was not farre from thence himſelfe: and comforted himſelfe with this, that if he were not Death himſelfe, he was yet his Beere. So iourneying towards the Monaſtery, with the wounded man, who with broken ſpeaches interrupted, by his approaching Death, recited the cauſe thereof. The Pilgrim being come vnto the Gate, and ſeeing by the cleere light of the Moone, in the front thereof, the Image of our Bleſſed Lady the Virgin; ſaid vnto the wounded man, that hee ſhould recommend his ſoule whileſt he knocked at the gate. At whoſe knocking the Porter being come, and informed by the Pilgrim of the accident, anſwered; tht with like diſſimulation, certaine Bandoleers of Iara, had one night robbed the Monaſtery, and for that cauſe hee could not open the gate, without the ſuperiours Licenſe. Pamphilus intreated him to diſpatch: but there being a long Garden betweene the Monaſtery and Cell, before he could return the Knight dyed in his armes.
            
               Pamphilus looked pale, diſmayde with the accident, and almoſt as dead as he, and incouraging him to this

fearefull and ſharpe paſſage, layde a Croſſe of two Mirtle bowes vpon his ſtomacke. Inſtantly hee heard a troope of Horſe, whoſe maſters being diuided into diuers paths, did ſeeke for the Dead man; By their words and their diligence, the Pilgrim knewe their deſigne, and calling them, ſhewed them him whom they ſought for, telling them how hee had found him. Amongſt them was his Brother, who ſeeing Pamphilus bloody, and in a Pilgrims habit (which is enough to make an honeſt man ſuſpected) cryed out, Oh thou Caſtillian traytor, thouhaſt murthered him to rob him. And at the very inſtant, the ſame friend who had killed this poore Knight, and who the better to couer his treaſon, accompanying the Brother, tooke holde of the Pilgrims arme; thou robber & infamous aſſaſſiuator, what hath made thee murther the nobleſt Knight which was in this Countrey? Sirs replyed Pamphilus, I found him in a Meadow hard by, bewayling his death, which hee ſaid was wrought by the hand of one whome he did accompt his beſt friend: and out of compaſſion and at his intreaty, I brought him to this Monaſtery, where he departed this life in my armes. But Tanſiles (who was this Traytor which had killed him) fearing leaſt the Pilgrim might diſcouer ſomething, which hee might haue heard from the dying man concerning his treaſon, pulling out a Piſtoll from the pommell of his ſaddle, gaue fire and aymed it directly at his head. Yet Heauen not permitting that it ſhould goe off (for Saintes and Angels doe alwayes aſſiſt the innocent) the Pilgrim liued. O let him liue ſaid Tirſus, (ſo was the dead mans brother called) for it is much better, that keeping

him in Priſon, hee may confeſſe his owne crime: and whether he killed him for to rob him, or whether ſome enemy of my Brother Godfreyes did not hyer him to murther him. The traytor anſwered to Tirſus, and to the others who did accompany him, that blood (yet warme) of his friend would not ſuffer him to delay his reuenge ſo long. Yet all their opinions preuailing againſt his; the innocent Pamphilus was bound hand and foot vpon a Horſe, and dead Godfrey laid vpon another. It is a iuſt Iudgment ſaid Pamphilus, (by the way) for my leauing of Niſa wounded, and Iacinth almoſt dead. Doe you not heare ſaid Tirſus? without doubt this Niſa is the woman for whoſe ſake he hath committed this murther, and Iacinih ſome friend, who led my Brother to the place. All of them beleeued what Tirſus ſaid, and the traytor Tanſiles iuterpreted Pamphilus his diſpaires in ſuch ſort, that euery one beleeued that Pamphilus did ſpeake of Godfreys death.
            They led him into no Towne, as hee thought they would, but vnto a Grange houſe, about halfe a League from the Monaſtery, the gate whereof was betweene two Towers. Tirſus knocketh, and a ſeruant anſwering: tell my Mother & Siſters (ſaid he) that I haue brought my brother Godfrey dead, and his murtherer with him. Inſtantly hee heard a great cry in the Hall of the houſe, by which Pamphilus did knowe that Fortune prepared a great deale of euill for him: Neuertheles deſiring to Dye, he reſolued not to defend his life with his tongue, which he could not doe with his armes. One opens the doore of the houſe, and with Candles lighted, the miſerable Mother, with her Daughters and ſeruants receiued

her dead Sonne. Some howling and crying carried him into the Hall, others ranne vpon poore Pamphilus, tearing his Beard and pulling him by the hayre of the Head, and almoſt aſtonied him with blowes. With this good entertainment, hee was lodged this night in one of the Towers, hauing his body loaden with Irons, yet he was heard vtter no wordes, but onely that he deſerued this and more for forſaking Niſa. All this night nothing was heard but cryes and complaints for Godfrey, and the time which was not imployed in this Funerall exerciſe, they ſpent in talking of Niſa and what ſhee ſhould be, whome their Priſoner had ſo often in his mouth.
            The light of the morning which very ſlowely enters into Priſons, brought day vnto Pamphilus, not in waking him who had not ſlept, but in aduertiſing his ſoule of his approaching Death, the certaine newes whereof he would willingly haue welcomed with guifts: when as the Priſon doore being open, hee ſawe Godfreys Mother and Siſters enter, demaunding of him in great paſſion and choller, wherefore hee had killed her Sonne? but he anſwering, onely for Niſa's ſake am I reduced vnto this miſery, they began to beate him with ſuch rage, that they left him almoſt dead; and ſhutting the Priſon, they reſolued to famiſh him to Death. But whileſt about noone, the dead body was carryed to Buriall, with Lights, Mourning, and Funerall company of his Parents & friends: Flerida his yongeſt Siſter, mollified with Pamphilus complaints, were it that his countenance did inforce her to beleeue his innocency, or that ſome other ſecret ſimpathy inclined her to haue

pitty of his life: went vnto the Priſon, and by the hole of the locke, ſayd thus vnto him: vnfortunate Pilgrim, doe not afflict thy ſelfe, for I will free thee in deſpite of my mother and my brothers; who art thou ſayde Pamphilus who promiſeſt life when there is nothing but heauen which can giue it me? I am Flerida (anſwered ſhee) one of Godfreys Siſters who doe promiſe it vnto thee, afflicted with thy griefe, out of the aſſurance I haue in my owne imagination of thy innocency.
            I ſweare vnto thee by God ſaid Pamphilus, that going in the night through a Meadowe, I found thy brother wounded vnto death, as he tolde me by one whome he did reccon to be his beſt friend; I tooke him vpon my ſhoulders, and caryed him vnto the Monaſtery, where he dyed in my armes before the Gate was opened: I do not deſire to liue, but the care which I haue of anothers life more then mine owne, makes me ſeeke my libertie contrary to my deſire; If thou canſt procure me it, I am a Knight, and of a family, from which vngratefull man nor Traytor euer ſprang: thou ſhalt doe a heroique deed worthy of an illuſtrious Lady, & though I ſhould neuer merrit it, yet heauen will not fayle to acknowledge it. Flerida had not need of ſo many reaſons, who was vertuous, and ſo well diſpoſed to free him, that ſhe would hazard a thouſand liues to giue it vnto him. And (as aptly it ſerued) thoſe which were gone to accompany her brothers body to the Graue, not being able to returne ſpeedily (aſwell in regarde of the diſtance of the place, as in reſpect of the pompe of the Funerall, which laſted nine dayes) gaue her oportune meanes to open the plankes on the top of the Priſon, thereby letting

him downe ſome vittailes: All her other Siſters, her Mother, and the ſeruants onely entred to torment him, they ſeeing him liue, not knowing wherewith he did ſuſtaine himſelfe; anger, indignation, and crueltie, increaſed ſo far in them, that they reſolued to kill him, before Tirſus his returne from the Obſequies of his brother: But Flerida the ſame night gaue him ſuch ſtrong Fyles, that the Fetters, Staples and Lockes, being cut aſunder, and he being faſtned vnto a corde, ſhe drewe him vp by that hole which ſhe had made, by remouing the planke; & all the houſhold being in their dead ſleep, ſhe opened the Gates: afterwards, with honeſt imbracings, ſhedding ſome teares, & with many Iuels which ſhe did conſtraine him to take, ſhe was departing from him, when he caſting himſelf at her feete, with the humbleſt wordes hee could ſpeake, promiſing to repay her this good turne with an immortall remembrance; and if that euer ſhe had occation to come into Caſteele, ſhe ſhould enquire for a Knight of Madreele called Pamphilus of Luxan, that ſhe might be aſſured ſhe ſhould not returne without due thankes and acknowledgements for ſo perfect an Obligation.
            
               Pamphilus knowing that to proceede further in the queſt of Niſa, was to reſiſt the will of heauen, which had oppoſed him in it with ſo many rigorous ſucceſſes, went vnto Saragoſſa; reſoluing from thence to trauell into Caſteele. If thou didſt not poſſeſſe O Niſa (ſayd he vnto himſelfe as he went along) all my thought, and if thou didſt not holde as much place in my body, as my ſoule doeth, which is all in euery parte; who would doubt, but Flerida ſhould be now Miſtris of my will? O how

powerfull are good turns in apt occaſions▪ ſeeing that the firmenes of Loue, which could not be moued with ſuch paynefull trauells, ſuch fearefull ſhipwracks, and with ſuch cruell Captiuities and impriſonments, with one good turne alone in an opportune time, is ſhaken, if not maſtered; at leaſt the roofe, if not the walles; and although the foundation bee firme, yet the windowes and other ornaments doe ſhake: Let not thoſe which ſhall heare this be diſpleaſed with him; for this was not ſo much a change from the Loue of Niſa, as a feeling of Flerida's goodwill: and as there is no body ſo ſolide, which the Sunne ſometime doth not pierce; ſo there is no Loue ſo firme, but that the firſt motions thereof may ſhake.
            
               Pamphilus ſo by long trauaile came vnto Saragoſſa, and would not enter into it before it was darke night, for feare hee might be followed or met by ſome one whome he knewe: and very earely in the morning departed from thence, and by vn-vſed pathes, from paſture to paſture, and from mountaine to mountaine, he endeauoured to ſhun the great high way, fearing that Flerida's Brother might make purſuite after him. In the end wearyed with the ſharpnes of the Mountaines, and the auſterity of the life, which he was conſtrayned to leade, hee reſolued one night to lye in ſome place where he might be better accommodated then in theſe Deſerts, and entring into a Citty which diuideth the two Kingdomes, hee enquired for a Lodging, But no body being willing to entertaine him, ſeeing him ſo euilly apparelled, his feete bloody, his face tanned, his hayre knotted & ſhagged: he went vnto the Hoſpitall,

the laſt refuge of miſery. Pamphilus found the gates open at that time, but without light, & asking the cauſe, he was tolde, that in regard of a ſtrange noyſe which euery night was there heard, which hath happened euer ſince the Death of a ſtranger who came thether to Lodge, no body hath dwelt there; yet hee might (as they ſaid) enter in if he would, for he ſhould find there a man of holy life in a little Chappell, who indured for the honour of God all thoſe illuſions, and who would ſhew him a place where he might lye without danger. Pamphilus then entred into a darke obſcure place, and after ſome fewe ſteps he might ſee a great way off, a dim light of a Lampe, vnto which place hee addreſſed himſelfe, and called the holy man: What wouldſt thou haue thou wicked Spirit, anſwered the holy man? Thou doeſt miſtake mee ſaid Pamphilus, I am a Pilgrim, who doe endeauour to ſeeke a lodging for this night. Then he opened the doore, where Pamphilus ſawe a man of a middle ſtature and age, with a long Beard and hayre, a Gowne of courſe rugge downe vnto his anckles, the Chappell was little, and Altar venerable, the baſſe whereof did ſerue him for his Bed: hee had a Stone for his pillowe, his Staffe for his companion, and a Deaths head for his looking-glaſſe.
            How durſt thou come into this place, ſaid hee vnto the Pilgrim, did no man aduertiſe thee of the diſquiet Lodging which is heere? I haue beene tolde it anſwered the Pilgrim, but I haue ſuffered ſo much Labour in my trauailes, ſo much Cruelty in impriſonments, ſo many heauy misfortunes and colde entertainments, that no diſquiet can be newe vnto mee.
            
               
The poore man then lighted a Candle at the Lampe, which burned before the Altar, and without ſaying any thing commaunded the Pilgrim to followe him; he went through a Garden, which lay wilde as a Foreſt or wildernes, where hauing ſhewed him a part of the houſe, amongſt ſome Cypres Trees hee vnlocked the doore of a Chamber, and ſaid vnto him, ſeeing thou art young and accuſtomed to trauailes, enter heere: make the ſigne of the Croſſe and bee not diſmayde nor aſtoniſhed but ſleepe; Pamphilus taketh the Candle, and ſetting it vpon a ſtone which lay there, biddeth his Hoſt good night and ſhutteh the doore.
            There was a Bed in the Chamber good enough to reſt vpon, eſpecially for a man who hath layne ſo many nights vpon the ground: this inuited him to vncloath himſelfe, and taking one of the ſhirts which Flerida at his departure had giuen him, he put it on, and went into it. Hardly had he reuolued in his imagination, the confuſion of his life, a thing which often (the body being at reſt) is repreſented vnto the minde, when as ſleep which is truely called the Image and brother of Death, poſſeſſed his ſences with that force, which doth accuſtomably vſe vnto weary Pilgrims. All that part, which the Sunne abandoneth when it goeth downe vnto the Indyes was in a deepeſilence, when as the noyſe of ſome Horſes awaked Pamphilus, he thought he was ſtirring (as it many times happeneth vnto Trauailers) and that his bed did moue as a Ship or a Horſe, which did carry him. Neuertheles remembring that hee was in the Hoſpitall, and the cauſes for which it was vnhabitable; he opened his eyes, he ſawe Horſemen enter by two

and two into the Chamber, who lighting Torches which they had in their handes at the Candle which he had left burning by him, they caſt them againſt the ſeeling of the Chamber, where they ſtucke faſt with their bottomes vpward and their tops downwards, which dropped downe burning flames vpon his bed, and vpon his clothes: He couereth himſelfe aſwell as poſſibly he could, leauing a litle hole to looke out that he might ſee whether his bed did burne or no; when as inſtantly he ſawe the flames out, and that vpon a Table which was in the corner of the Chamber, foure of them were at Primero, they paſſed, diſcarded, and ſet vp money as if they had truely playde: ſo long till at length they debating vpon a difference, they fell into quarrell in the Chamber, which made ſuch a noyſe with claſhing of Swords, that the miſerable Pamphilus called vpon (for helpe) our Lady of Gadalupe, which was onely left (of all the ſhrynes in Spaine) vnuiſited, although it were in his owne Country of Toledo. Becauſe holy places neare vnto one, are many times left vnuiſited out of a hope, which is had, that they might bee viſited at any time. Neuertheles the clattering of the ſwordes and all other noyſe, for the ſpace of halfe an houre ceaſed, and he was all of a ſweat out of the very feare he had; yet now well ſatisfied to ſee himſelfe in their abſence at ſome reſt, not thinking that they would come againe, when inſtantly hee felt that the bed and the clothes were pulled away from him by the outtermoſt corners: and he ſawe at the ſame time, a man come in with a Torch in his hand lighted, followed by two others, the one with a great braſen Baſon, and the other ſharpening a little Knife.

Then began hee to tremble, and all his hayre ſtood an end, he would haue ſpoken but he was not able, when they were neere him, he who held the Torch put it out, and Pamphilus thinking that they would kill him, and that the Baſon was to receiue his blood, put his handes forth againſt the knife, and felt that they laide hold on him; hee gaue a great cry, & the Torch inſtantly kindled againe: and he ſawe himſelfe betweene two Maſtiffe dogs, who held him faſt in their teeth. Ieſus cryed out Pamphilus, at which name all theſe fanſtaſticke illuſions vaniſhed away, leauing him ſo weary and ſo affrighted with their company, that hee would not ſtay there any longer: but going out into the Garden by which he was entred, he went vnto the Chamber of the good Hermite, who ſeeing him ſo pale, weake and naked, opened him the doore, and ſaid vnto him; haue your Hoſts heere giuen you an euill nights Lodging? So ill ſaid Pamphilus, that I haue not reſted all night, and yet I haue left them my clothes to pay for it. The good man receiued him aſwell as he could; telling him how many others with like ſucceſſe had beene ſo vſed, and many other diſcourſes, wherewith he paſt away the night vntill morning.
            Thoſe who doe not knowe the nature, quality, and condition of Spirits, will accompt of this hiſtory as a fable: wherefore I doe not thinke it vnfit to aduertiſe them, that there are ſome, fallen from the loweſt Quire of Angels, who out of the Eſſentiall paines, which is the Eternall priuation from the ſight of God, ſuffer leſſe pains then the other, as not hauing ſo much ſinned. And thoſe are of ſuch Nature that they cannot much

hurt men, but doe take pleaſure to diſpleaſe them; with frightings, noyſes, rumours, ſubtilties, and ſuch like other thinges, which they doe in the night in houſes, which thereby they make altogether vnhabitable, not being able otherwayes to hurt but by theſe fooliſh and ridiculous effects, limitted and bound, by the Almighty power of God. Theſe the Italians call Fayries, the Spaniards Elues, and the French Hobgoblins; of whoſe mockery and ſports William Totan ſpeaketh, in his Book of Warre of Deuils, calling them Deuils of the leſſe noble Hierarchy. Caſsian writeth, that in Norway they poſſeſſe high wayes, play with paſſengers, and doe hyer themſelues out for wages as ſeruants. Ierome Manchy, reporteth of a Spirit which was in Loue with a youngman, ſerued him, ſolicited him in diuers formes, and ſtealing money bought him many thinges wherein hee delighted. Michel Pſelho, makes ſixe kindes of theſe Spirits, Fiery, Ayrie, Earthy, Watry, Subteranians, and fire flying Spirits: In all which Authors one may ſee, their properties, their illuſions, and their remedies.
            The light of the Day, which is the amiable and illuſtrious Daughter of Heauen, and the onely guide of Mortals, did ſufficiently aſſure Pamphilus, that now he neede not any more to feare the euill infeſtings of the Spirits: then waking this good man, they both riſe, and went together vnto the Chamber, where Pamphilus lay: but entering in to ſee the ſtirre that was made the laſt night, they found the bed, Pamphilus clothes, and all other thinges in the ſame place where they had layde, without any appearance that they had beene ſtirred. Whereat Pamphilus being aſhamed, with haſt made

himſelfe ready without ſpeaking a word, and thinking that this good Hermit would account him for a great Lyer, and a man of weake courage, departed from him, and thence tooke his way towards Gadalupe without once daring to turne his head towards the Citty, vowing vnto himſelfe, neuer to come into it againe vpon any occaſion whatſoeuer ſhould happen, if he were not aſſured to finde his Niſa there.
            There are two Hilles in the confines of the Mountaine of Morena, which as two ſtrong walls doe inuiron the Towne and Monaſtery of Gadalupe, with ſo many Fountaines which doe runne from the Rockes into the bottome of the Valley, ſo much Fruit and ſo much graine of all ſorts, that it ſeemeth Nature knowing that which ſhould happen, had deſtined this place from the beginning of the world, to build this Pallace to the Princeſſe of Heauen. The Pilgrim being come thether, and hauing adored the Virgin, viſited the Temple, and payed his vowe: as hee went backe againe downe the ſtayres, at that time of the yeare when as the Sunne is equally diſtant betweene the two Poles; he met a Paſſenger going towards the Temple, who earneſtly beholding him, asked him, if he had not knowne either there or in any other place, a Pilgrim of Madreele called Pamphilus, who lately was in Arragon. Pamphilus troubled with this demaund, and fearing that hee was ſought after with ſome warrant from the Iuſtice, for Godfreys death, turned back and fled towards the Temple; But the Aragoniſe by ſome tokens which were giuen him, and by his ſodaine flying, preſuming that it was he, followed him and curteouſly calling him, ſaid,

ſtay Knight; I am not come to apprehend you, neither doth the priuiledge of this place permit any man to be arreſted Priſoner heere. It is onely a Letter from a young Lady called Flerida, which I bring you: ſee thereby what I am, and for what occaſion I ſeeke you. Pamphilus then ſtaying tooke the Letter, and hauing opened it, found the contents as followeth.
            
               To the Pilgrim of Madreele.
               
               THou thy ſelfe O Pamphilus mayeſt iudge in what care thou lefts mee, if thou haſt had neuer ſo little thought of me ſince thou left me. And now aſwell to ſatisfie my ſelfe as to knowe how thy misfortunes are determined, haue I ſent this Meſſenger vnto you. My Brothers being returned and miſſing thee in the Priſon where they had left thee, witneſſed more ſorrowe for thy departure, then for my brother Godfreys death. But a fewe dayes after, a woman of the Countrey falling out with another, amongſt other wordes, (which choller prouoked, a thing ordinary amongſt women) ſaide ſhee was the cauſe of Godfrey his Death. Being thereupon taken, and hauing confeſſed that Tanſiles killed him out of Iealouſie, hee was apprehended, and the cryme being verified, the third day after he had his Head cut off. My Mother and my Brother being now aſſured of thy Innocency, doe bewayle their hard vſage towards thee, and haue made great ſearch to finde thee. If thou wilt returne, they will redeeme the iniurie of thy vniuſt Impriſonment, with imbracings & kinde vſage, and thou ſhalt thereby

pay me for the deſire which I continually haue of thy welfare, and for the teares which thou haſt coſt me.
               The Pilgrim wondred at Tanſiles ſtrange ſucceſſe, and was ſomething moued in his minde with Flerida's louing deſires: But fearing to offend Niſa, hee ſatisfied the Meſſenger aſwell as hee could, giuing him the Iewels which Flerida had giuen him, intreating that he would ſecretly deliuer them; together with a moſt kinde Letter vnto her, which hee preſently writ, and ſo the ſame day diſpatched away the Meſſenger, who went his way very ioyfull that he had in ſo ſhort a time ſo happily diſpatched his buſines: For Flerida not thinking he could eaſily finde him, had commaunded him to ſearch him, in euery houſe where Pilgrims were vſed to Lodge throughout all Spaine. I doe heere remember that I heard Pamphilus ſay, after he had retired himſelfe to couert from the ſtorme of his Fortunes, that hee neuer in all his life, found any thing ſo difficult, as to reſiſt Flerida's deſire, for beſides the obligations wherein hee ſtood tyed, which were very great and no leſſe then for his life, ſhee was moſt perfectly fayre; yet he continued his louing friendſhip by Letters, not onely with her, but with her Brothers alſo, vntill that ſhee being Marryed with a Knight of Andaluzia was carryed into the Indyes.
               
               Tenne times had the Sunne circled Heauen in the time of the yeare when as Aſtrea doth equall the ballances of the Equinoctial, when Pamphilus iournying night and day through Deſarts and vnknowe wayes, found himſelfe one morning when the Day began to ſmile on him at the ſide of craggy Mountaines, oppreſſed both

with weariſomnes and hunger, and much more with the remembrance of Niſa▪
                   Where ſitting at the foote of an Oake beholding the ſolitarines of the Fields, and the murmuring of the little Brookes which fell precipitatly from the Mountaine, hee heard a Flute played vpon, vnto the ſound whereof turning his eyes, he ſawe a man ſitting betweene two Rockes, amidſt a flocke of Sheepe, which ſeemed to leaue their feeding to hearken to his Muſicke.
               But Pamphilus hauing other diſcourſes in his head, went vnto him, and wiſhing health vnto him, (which hee could not obtaine for himſelfe) and curteouſly againe ſaluted by the Shepheard, who hauing nothing that ſauoured of ruſticknes but his Apparell, made him knowe in a fewe reaſons his vnderſtanding; and the other quickly diſcerned in the Pilgrim, that he had more neede of meate, then diſcourſe. Wherefore getting fire out of two Lawrell ſtickes, which for that purpoſe hee carryed with him, they poorely fed of that which Fabio (for ſo was this Shepheard called) had willingly dreſſed, the ground ſeruing them for a Table, the graſſe for napkins, and bubling Brookes for their drinke and muſique, They paſſed away the beſt part of the day in telling their aduentures: and when it grewe night, they retired themſelues into a little Village, whether Fabio led Pamphilus to keepe his maſters Oxen, who was a Farmer of a Grange which Niſa her Father had in the Mountaines. Pamphilus was glad of this condition, hoping that by this meanes he might with time haue newes of his Miſtres, by the way Pamphilus intreated Fabio to relate the cauſe of his retiring into this place,

who although that this requeſt brought vnto his mind a great deale of griefe and paſſion, yet after ſome ſighes he ſhortly tolde him, that hee was borne in Biſcay, and diſcended of moſt noble Parents, who were carefull to fit him in his youth, with quallities anſwerable vnto his Birth, wherein he profited ſo well, that he neither rayſed diſcontentment in his Parents nor ſhame vnto his Tutors; but after growing more ripe in yeares, and incited with the couragious heate of youth. In thoſe times, when the Engliſh with their warlike Ships rauaged alongſt our Coaſts, aſwell of Spaine as the Ilands, and oftentimes with their deſperate reſolutions, made themſelues maſters of our Indian Golde, I put my ſelfe to Sea in one of the Kings Armadoes, aſwell with an intent to gaine honour by my valour, as experience in thoſe ſeruices, thereby to bee the abler to ſerue my Countrey, wherein I was ſo fortunate, (becauſe I will not ſay too much) that I got commaund my ſelfe, and by taking and executing two or three of thoſe Pirats, was in a faire way both of grace with the King, and renowne in the world, when my eyes were the inſtruments, whereby the moſt excellent and admirable beauty of Albiana captiuated my heart, ſo powerfully, that all other courſes ſet apart, I was inforced to giue my ſelfe wholly to her ſeruice, wherein after ſome ſmall time, I had ſo happy a progreſſion, that ſhee did confeſſe ſhe was obliged by my perſeuerance, and by the opinion which the world held of me, to eſteeme of mee and of my ſeruice: thus happily in her fauour I ſpent ſome time, vntill it fortuned ſome Engliſh ſlaues which I had, endeauouring to make an eſcape, but by my Soldiers

and Marryners preuented, I inflicted a cruell puniſhment vpon them, bound thereunto by that common pollicy which exacteth from Maſters, a ſeueere hand ouer their mutinous Slaues; eſpecially I vſed it towards one, who more eminent then the reſt, aſwell in regard of his perſon, as that hee was a cheefe author of their attempt, which Albiana with moſt earneſt prayers vnto me ſought to diuert, were it out of a pittifull compaſſion, ordinary in moſt women, or that ſhe tooke any ſpeciall liking vnto him: But I hauing more care at that time to execute my rage, then mindefull of her importunity, (which I did not thinke would haue turned to that conſequence) for example ſake, which as it is powerfull, ſo is it moſt neceſſary, eſpecially amongſt men of our profeſſion, who ſerue our ſelues with multitudes of them, perſeuered in hauing him ſoundly puniſhed. Whereat ſhee diſcontented, though with little ſhew thereof, vnder-hand wrought ſuch meanes by her friends in Court, before I imagined any ſuch thing, that the Slaue was by meſſenger from the Duke of Lerma, and by warrant vnder the Kings hand fetched from me, and the next day ſhee did let me knowe that any denyall to a Woman, effects her hatred; For ſhee ſent me a Letter wherein ſhe ſaid, I was a cruell Monſter, and that ſhe was ſo farre from Louing and eſteeming me, that ſhe would euer hate my barbarous Nature, and ſhe wondred, that any valour could bee lodged where cruelty had ſuch a habitation; to conclude ſhee tolde me, that I ſhould neuer come in her ſight, nor be where ſhe might heare of my name. How grieuous this was vnto me gentle Sir, may eaſily be geſſed if you

knewe the extremity of my Loue, which was ſo much that I preſently without the knowledge of any of my friends tooke ſuch order, as I could with my command, and retired my ſelfe into theſe Deſert places, where I am reſolued vnder this diſguiſed habite to end my dayes; ſeeing that Albiana will haue it ſo, who whether her complaints were iuſt or no, or whether they but ſerue to colour her vnconſtancy, ſhall bee alwayes loued and truely obayed by me, vnto whome onely this comfort is left, That though Life hath left me, Death will take me.
               Before Fabio had finiſhed this ſhort diſcourſe, they had diſcouered the Village, where Alfeſibus did keepe Niſa's fathers Cattell, in the beſt houſe of the Village, which for a Countrey houſe was a faire one, Alfeſibus receiued Pamphilus, and informed by Fabio of his intent, he agreed with him for wages; and after an euill ſupper and a worſe Lodging, hee paſſed the night miſerably. And when morning appeared, Pamphilus went after his Oxen vnto the ſolitary Fields, where hee liued ſome time free from the confuſed noyſes of the Citties, a good leaſure to meditate vpon his aduentures.
               In the meane time Niſa healed of her woundes, knew that ſhe had receiued them from her owne Brother, out of Iealouſie which hee had conceiued againſt her for Finia. And intreating his good Hoſt that hee would haue pitty vpon her blood, by both their meanes his pardon and liberty was obtained, the one ſoliciting, and the other forbearing the proſecution. One of the woundes which Niſa had receiued was in her left ſide, and as in the Dreſſing it could not be auoyded, but that

ſhee was knowne to bee a Woman, although ſhe had coniured her Hoſt to keepe it ſecret from his Family, yet it was impoſſible: Becauſe that his Sonne Theſander vnhappily one day was at her dreſſing and tranſported ſo into his minde the woundes which ſhee had in her body, that within a fewe dayes, hee fell ſicke by force of this continuall thought, not being able to receiue into his imagination any thought, but the deſire of this beauty. For all the heauen of Loue, moueth vpon theſe two poles, Imagination, and Deſire. And then his body is as full of imaginary and fantaſticke figures, as the Aſtrologians Globe. Theſander did all that he could to diuert himſelfe from this thought, and as euils are healed by their contraries, hee propoſed vnto his eyes other obiects, and other cares vnto his imaginations: But as Art is made out of many experiences, which were wanting vnto Theſander, hee rather found the euill then the remedy. For it is impoſſible that young men ſhould knowe much, becauſe that to bee wiſe requires experience, and that is gotten with time.
               
                  Niſa was much grieued at Theſanders paſſion, although hee had neuer ſpoken vnto her about it. But as hee which is Amorous ſo often ſpeaketh as he looketh vpon that which he loueth, ſhe eaſily read▪ in his lookes the depth of his thoughts; and willing to diſabuſe him ſo, that not being vnderſtood by others, ſhee might let him vnderſtand the vanity of his Loue, one night after ſhee was healed, being intreated by all the company, ſhe ſung theſe Verſes following.
               
                  
                     
                     I wot not what is Loue, nor yet his flame,
                     Nay more, to knowe it I haue not the mnde:
                     In others, t'will ſuffice a man may finde,
                     The woes this Tyrant in their ſoules doth frame.
                  
                  
                     That I for him doe ſigh hee cannot ſay,
                     Hee maſtreth not my will, that bideth free:
                     His bad and my good Nature diſagree,
                     And free, me from his Empires Lawes for aye.
                  
                  
                     To caſt his Darts elſe where, I him require,
                     My heart (as Rockes of braſſe) doth ſcorne his might:
                     Let him not grieue, I from him take my flight,
                     Becauſe I am all yee, and hee all fire.
                  
               
               But they rather increaſed the fire which was too much kindled in Theſanders ſoule, who taking the Lute from Niſa, anſwered her with theſe Verſes, which hee had conceiued in his minde the night before.
               
                  
                     The great Gods ſupreame puiſant to deny,
                     Vnto my ſoule as raſhnes I doe holde:
                     This to deny with truth I may bee bolde:
                     Mine euill, nor yet my ſelfe I can deſory.
                  
                  
                     My knowledge, Loue hath rauiſht whome you blame,
                     I thinke hee hath no might nor yet diſcretion:
                     If I bee thus tormented for Confeſsion.
                     You that deny his power feele not the ſame.
                  
                  
                     
                     He makes the wideſt breach in ſtrongeſt Braſſe,
                     From coldeſt yce, he greateſt fire can drawe:
                     Not one can ftye him; for none euer ſawe,
                     Ought elſe his ſhafts in ſwiftnes to ſurpaſſe.
                  
               
               Very aptly might Niſa at that time haue reuenged, the motions which Pamphilus had to agree vnto▪ 
                  Flerida's will: It Loue had beene a Spirit, (as ſome haue beleeued) which might haue toled them vnto her.
               But it was not iuſt that ſo rare a Faith ſhould be ſpotted with any infamy. Theſanders Loue in the meane time, ſpringing from this firſt ſparkle increaſed by Niſa's reſiſtance, like a Fire which a little Water maketh more violent; or like Palme Trees growing moſt, when a waight is layde vpon them.
               
                  Niſa waxed ſtrong and walked abroad, when deſperate Theſander diſcouered himſelfe vnto a Phyſician, who incouraged him either to manifeſt his euill, or elſe as the beſt remedy, againſt his Loue to worke from his imagination, this deepe melancholy, and to diuert it by ſome honeſt exerciſe, and that the courage of the practiſer is the firſt matter vpon which the Heauens doe imprint the forme of their ſuccors, for as much as their fauour is not obtained by womaniſh prayers and vowes but by the vigorius actions of men, agreeing vnto which the Greeke adage ſayeth that the Gods doe ſell their bleſſings vnto men, in exchange of their labors. Theſander was animated by theſe councells, but finding that diuiſions were weake remedyes againſt the ſplendor of Niſas beautie, he fell into a relapſe, and grew ſo weake that he was conſtrained to diſcouer the cauſe of

his ſicknes. The pittifull Father who was already informed of Niſa's quality, coniured her with teares, to be Miſtres of his wealth, and marry his Son, of whoſe ſicknes there was no other remedy: Niſa admiring at the ſeuerall wayes, whereby Fortune ſought to ſeperate her from Pamphilus, diſcouered then vnto the good olde man, the whole hiſtory of her life, and layde before him all the impoſſibilities which did excuſe her from ſatisfiing ſo many curteſies; the chiefeſt whereof was, in his willingnes to admit her to the higheſt degree of Honor and affection that was poſſible for him to doe, ſhee being a ſtranger, and in ſuch an vndecent habit, for a woman fit to be his Sonnes wife. By this meanes ſhe ſatisfied the Father: But the poore Theſander was ſo deſperate, that falling into greater extremity, hee was at the laſt point of his life; like vnto Trees whoſe boughes doe not looſe their greenenes, vntill that their humour which doth quicken them doe abſolutely fayle, becauſe that hope is the radicall moyſture which doth keepe vs aliue, and is vnto vs as Oyle vnto our fire. Niſa ſeeing that Theſander was for her ſake vpon the point of loſing his life, and ſhee herſelfe, had not now liued, but out of his Fathers pitty, was exceedingly perplexed, that ſhee could not ſatisfie ſo iuſt an obligation: and not being able to reſt in theſe confuſed thoughts, the repreſentations of Pamphilus labours did alwayes appeare in her minde, who ſhe thought to be Priſoner ſtill at Valence. Theſanders euill increaſed, Niſa deferred the remedy, & the Father accuſed this poore amorous man, in my opinion innocent, becauſe, that in thinges naturall, we doe neither merit nor Demerit: In briefe, all the whole

family intreated Niſa that ſhe would haue pitty of Theſanders young yeares, and that at the leaſt ſhe would aſſwage his paſſion with one amorous word.
               Amongſt all the variable Fortunes aſwell by Land as Sea, which our Pilgrim had ſuffered, there was none ſo difficult vnto her as this. Neuertheles ſhee reſolued to entertaine Theſander, vntill hee had recouered ſome ſtrength, that thereby he might the better bee able to beare the ſubtilty which ſhee intended. And in this ſhe did not deceiue herſelfe, for our ſpirits, haue ſome reſemblance with the nature of young Horſes, which are eaſilyer managed with gentle Bits then with hard; The ſweet wordes, the fained hopes, and imbracings of Niſa within few dayes reſtored Theſanders weakened ſpirit, during which time, Celio was deliuered out of Priſon, with an exceeding deſire to ſee her, aſwell becauſe hee had heard newes of her health, as becauſe he imagined, that if Finia were not in her company, yet at the leaſt he might heare ſome newes of her. Neuertheles the ſorrowfull Niſa beleeuing that Celio deſired to kill her, not knowing what Pamphilus had told him of her diſguiſing in the habit of a Pilgrim; ſo ſoone as ſhe heard of his inlargement, fled ſecretly from Barcelon. In the meane time Liſard the Eldeſt brother vnto Celio and Niſa, who as you heard, was a Soldier in Flanders, Diſimbarquing in the ſame Towne of Barcelon, farre from thinking that perſons ſo neare him were there: hauing met with Finia vpon the way, on the firſt day of her trauell, althogh almoſt in the laſt of the tragecall▪ Comedy of her fortunes, ſorry to ſee ſo faire a Pilgrim goe a foote, vnderſtanding which way ſhe was bound, offered to accompany

her into Caſteele: Finia willing to be gone from Celio, whom ſhe thought neuer to bee able to appeaſe, and not knowing that this was his Brother, accpteth his offer, and goeth with him to Toledo. Where being receiued of his Parents with all kinde of Ioy, his deſire was that Finia might alſo be well entertained and kindly vſed, telling them in what manner he had found her, his Parents receiued her with a great deale of honour and imbracings, yet not without ſome ſuſpitions that ſhee was ſome ſpoyle of the Flanders war. Liſard then asked for his Brother Celio and for his Siſter Niſa, they telling him the cauſe of their abſence. Finia thereby knew that the houſe whereinto ſhee was come, was her husbands Fathers, and that he who had brought her thether, was his Brother, whereat not ſufficiently wondring, ſhee then thought that Fortune began to looke vpon her misfortunes, with a more cleere countenance.
               The day following, Liſard reſoluing to goe ſeeke for his ſiſter Niſa, and to kill Pamphilus, tolde his Parents that he had ſome pretentions at the Court, vpon which he built the neceſſity of a new voyage, ſhewing them ſome atteſtations in writing of that which he had done in Flanders, for which he hoped of good recompence. His Father perſpicuoſly knowing his minde through his reaſons, wherewith hee endeauoured to colour his Iourney, and fearing to looſe him with the other, propounded a thouſand obiections, telling that he ſhould now reſt after his voyage, and from the trauels of War, contenting himſelfe with the honor which he had gotten, becauſe that in this age the reward did flye from the merit. Liſard thus perſwaded by his Father, remained

in the houſe although it grieued him, that after he had bought ſo much renowne with the loſſe of his blood ſo farre from his owne Countrey, he ſhould now lye ſtill and ruſt with infamy; finally being diſcontent, that he was beheld as he thought with this marke, hee went into the Country, to ſhun the firſt incounter of the peoples ſight, into the ſame Village, where amongſt the other ſeruants of his Fathers farmer, Pamphilus liued, who was neuer before knowne of Liſard; and as one day hee beheld him more curiouſly then he did all the others, for hardly could the baſenes and indignity of his habite diſguiſe his perſon and beauty; he called him vnto him, and informing himſelfe of the cauſe, why hee liued in this baſe office: The excuſes which he made, did not ſeeme currant, (indeed being fained by Pamphilus, who already knewe that Liſard was Niſa's eldeſt Brother.) Wherefore Liſard ſaid vnto him, that he ſhould doe better, if leauing this ruſticke life, hee would abide in his ſeruice and take the charge of two Horſes which he had, for which he would giue him wages, and conuenient clothes; Pamphilus refuſed this offer, not that hee was not willing to returne into this happy houſe, in which he had firſt knowne Niſa: But fearing that being knowne in her abſence, hee ſhould run a dangerous fortune of his life. Neuertheles, being weary of the auſtere life which he led amongſt theſe Mountaines, for there is nothing more true (as the Philoſophers ſay) then that thoſe which are ſolitary are either Gods or Deuils; hee reſolued in the end to accept of this condition, wiſhing rather that he might Dye by Niſa's Parents hands, then Liue any longer in theſe ſolitary Deſerts.
               
                  
Now you ſee how forward we are in bringing back our Pilgrim from his long trauels, ſeeing that from being a Courtier, he became a Soldier; frō a ſoldier, a Captiue; from a captiue, a Pilgrim; from a Pilgrim, a Priſoner; frō a Priſoner a Madman; frō a Madman, a Herdſman; frō a Herdſman, a miſerable Lacky, in the ſame houſe where all his misfortunes began: To the end that you ſeeing this circle of fortune from one Pole vnto another, without one moment of reſt, or any of good, in the beginning, middle, or end of his aduentures: you may learne to know, how trauailing abroad brings honour, & profite, and many times the contrary. All conſiſteth in the diſpoſition of Heauen, whoſe influence guide the paſſages of our life, as it pleaſeth them; becauſe that althogh the empire of free-will bee aboue, yet fewe perſons be found who doe reſiſt their motions; It is therefore a weaknes vnworthy of a gentle heart, not to dare hazardouſly to enterpriſe any thing, ſeeing it is euident, that if thoſe who haue effected great thinges, had not begun them, they had neuer atchiued them, As alſo hazardous enterpriſes belong onely to braue courages; although Heauen diſpoſe of the ſucceſſe. Aboue all things the election importeth much, as Propertius ſaith, all thinges are not equall vnto all. Seneca telleth of an old man who being asked, how he could liue vnto thoſe yeares in following the Court; anſwered, that it was in doing good turnes & not excepting agaiuſt iniuries; But this patience doth not ſeeme honourable vnto me, nor that it is any vertue to ſerue to Liue. And if Poſterity doth render vnto euery body his honor as Tacitus ſaith, what renowne can he leaue behind him, who dyeth as it were in

the cradle, & from his ſwadling cloutes vnto his hearſe, hath hardly ſhifted a ſhirt; like vnto the Plant, which hath the forme of a liuing Lambe, the ſtocke whereof growing out of the ground vnto the ſtomack, & not being able to eate more graſſe, then that which groweth round about it, dyeth for want of nouriſhment. Glorious was Darius, when being come vnto the Riuer Tearus, which taketh his beginning from two Fountaines, wherof the one is hot and the other cold, he cauſed the famous inſcription whereof Herodalus ſpeaketh to bee made; to this place, againſt the Scitheans came, the moſt famous of all other men, Darius the ſonne of Hidaſpes. Who hath euer obtained any thing without rūning for it? Who hath euer runne for it, if he haue not ſeene it? and what reſt can he know, who hath neuer proued any ſtorme or aduerſity by Sea or Land? For there are no dayes ſo ſweet & comfortable, as thoſe which we ſpend in the armes of our friends, after long trauell and great dangers; nor any nights ſo ſweet, as thoſe which are ſpent about the fire with an attentiue Family, vnto the diſcourſes of ones former dangers and aduentures; As Vliſſes within Zacinth vnto his deare Penelope, & his Son Telemaquus. So after many diuers aduentures, Pamphilus commeth vnto the happy day of his reſt, and though he were not at the ſiege of Troy, not at the Conqueſt of the newe World with Cortes, yet it was no ſmall valour in him, to defend himſelfe from ſo many different & perilous aſſaults of Fortune, and in the end to haue merited by ſo many labours, the reſt which ſhortly hee ſhall enioy in his owne Countrey.
               Whileſt theſe things thus paſſed in the Mountains of

                  Toledo, Theſander being recouered by Niſa's louing imbracings, and ſhe diſpoſed to leaue him, as well becauſe his life was aſſured as becauſe that ſhe deſired to aſſure hers, and deliuer herſelfe from the care wherewith ſhe was ſearched after by her Brother Celio.
               
               One night when ſleepe maſtered her Louers ſences, and held a ſilence ouer the whole Family, ſhe went out of the Citty, and taketh the way towards Lerida. But night had hardly all hid her blacke head, crowned both with ſleepe and feare, when the deceiued Theſander waked out of the moſt ſorrowfull Dreame that could poſſeſſe his fantaſie, repreſenting to his imagination, the abſence of fugitiue Niſa, together with her deceitfull wordes, her ſweet diſdaines, and her faire 
                     •
                  ace; a thing which ſometime hapneth, principally vnto him which loueth or feareth. In aſmuch as thoſe thinges which threaten vs, doe repreſent vnto vs in ſleeping, the ſame cares which wee haue in the day awake. Theſander riſing in this imagination, began to ſearch Niſa guided by the light of his ſoule, and not finding her, it little wanted that hee did not dye with griefe for her departure; neither his Father, nor the reſt of his Parents had power enough to keepe him from rūning after. And ſo he came to Toledo long time before Niſa. For a Louer whofoloweth that which he loueth, doth go faſter, then he who flyeth frō that which he doth not loue; becauſe hee which doth not loue groweth ſorrowfull in going, and hee which loueth, by going puts off his griefe.
               In the meane time, Liſard much pleaſed with Pamphilus, his vnderſtanding and perſon, had taken him to wayte in his Chamber, not ſuffering him to liue in the

baſenes of his firſt office which he had giuen him, and in this quality hee liued at Toledo with his Maſter, alwayes taking great care, that his maſters Parents might not ſee him, becauſe that if they had viewed him with any conſideration, they muſt needs haue knowne him. But Liſard who with frequent conuerſation with Finia, (whome his Parents did vſe as louingly as they could haue done Niſa) was fallen in Loue with her, diſcouered one time vnto Pamphilus, and making him the miniſter of his paſſion, gaue him charge to ſpeake vnto her, and to diſpoſe her, (with all his power) to be fauourable vnto his deſires; Pamphilus obeying his Maſter, and taking occaſion one Feſtiuall day, when euery body was abroad, hee went to finde Finia from Liſard: But when in comming vnto her hee knewe her to bee his Siſter, and ſhee knewe him to be her Brother, they both remayned aſtoniſhed, dumbe, and as immouable as ſtones. But ſhortly after this firſt confuſion, Pamphilus began to ſpeake in this manner: Siſter tell me by what meanes thou cameſt hither, ſince Celio abandoning thee left thee in Barcelon, for I knowe already the whole progreſſe of thy misfortune, as conformable vnto mine as wee are equall in Birth.
               By his meanes whome the Deſtinies pleaſed, vnto whoſe diſpoſing my will cannot reſiſt: Liſard brother of my Husband Celio, hauing found mee vpon the way from Saragoſſa brought me hither, where I thinke, I may abide his returne with more honour. The ſame man ſaid Pamphilus, ſendeth me vnto thee to ſpeake vnto thee about his Loue, and hee hauing found me in a Grange which he hath in the Mountaines of Toledo,
                  
where I had ſheltered my ſelfe, from the ſtroakes of Fortune, vnder the baſeſt condition of the world, hath brought me now into this place where thou now ſeeſt me in the quality of a Groome; and becauſe that heretofore in the beginning of my Fortunes I haue beene in this houſe, I kept my ſelfe from being ſeene vntill this time, as thou mayeſt well know, hauing not beene ſeene vntill this day by thee. Suffer and abide the end of thy Fortune as I haue done, and doe not ſay thou knoweſt me, for I will entertaine Liſard with ſome Lye from thee, vntill ſuch time, that wee may ſee whereunto the reuolution of this coniunction of our misfortunes will tend, and when will end the effects of this our honours ecclipſe. Thus did Pamphilus and Finia meete, and in ſtead of reprehending one the other, they remayned there both good friends, for it is ordinary with thoſe who are culpable, to diſſemble the faults of others, leaſt they be reprehended for their own. In this meane time, Theſander went from place to place in Toledo inquiring for Niſa, and when theſe newes came vnto Liſards eares, that there was a young man which enquired for his Siſter; Hee verily thought that it was Pamphilus, who by ſome ſiniſter accident hauing loſt her, was come thither to finde her. And telling vnto Pamphilus the ſtory of Niſa's rauiſhing, which hee knewe much better, told him, that hee was now in Toledo in her queſt; and that hauing no man, in whoſe hands hee could better commit the ſatisfaction of his reuenge, then his, nor of whoſe courage and fidelity hee could be better aſſured of; he intreats him, and coniures him to kill him. A notable winding in a ſucceſſe ſo ſtrange and ſo imbroiled,

which is ſo much the more admirable vnto me, who knowe it better then they who reads it, how true it is.
               
                  Pamphilus aſtoniſhed, to ſee that hee was ingaged to kill Pamphilus, at the leaſt a man, who either in ſearching for Niſa, or elſe one who for the onely diſaſter of his name deſerued to dye, endeauoreth to finde him, rather to know what he would with Niſa, then with any mind to execute Liſards intent vpon the others innocency. His maſter did not accompany him in this action; for as Tacitus ſaith of Nero, although hee commaunded Murthers, yet he alwayes turned his ſight away from them.
               
                  Pamphilus hauing found Theſander priuately, would informe himſelfe of the cauſe why he inquired for Niſa: Theſander recounted the ſtory from Niſa's being wounded by Celio, and healed by his Father, ſhee had left them one night without bidding them adue, paying with ingratitude all the good offices which were done her in that houſe. Neither did he forget to relate how ſhee (for the dreſſing of her wound) being conſtrained to open her breſts, ſhee was diſcouered to bee a Woman; from whence proceeded his deſire, and the cauſe why hee ſought her in this place, which ſhee ſaid was the place of her Birth. Ioyfull was Pamphilus to heare of the healing of Niſa's wounds, and in ſtead of killing Theſander hee led him into his Chamber, where hauing vſed him with all the curteſie that was poſſible, he tolde him that in this houſe where hee remayned, were Niſa's Parents and Brother.
               
                  Liſard hauing a great opinion of Pamphilus his courage, whome he called Maurice, did verily beleeue that

hee would infallibly kill Niſa's rauiſher, which hee beleeued to bee Theſander, wherefore he demaunded leaue of his Father to goe, fearing that if Maurice ſhould happely bee taken Priſoner, he might confeſſe the author of Pamphilus his death. The Father afflicted at his departure, fearing that in this his age, Death might take him in the abſence of all his Children, would know the cauſe of his Iourney: And Liſard telling him that hee had ſent to kill him, who had run away with his Siſter, who was come vnto Toledo, and that hee did beleeue, that his ſeruant vnto whome he had giuen this commiſſion had already executed it, put the olde man into a greater care then hee was in before, much fearing the Damage which might come from ſo violent a reuenge: Pamphilus had perſwaded Theſander, to call himſelfe Pamphilus vnto all thoſe, who ſhould aske his name in Toledo, aſſuring him that hee ſhould the ſooner heare newes of Niſa: In this time Liſard and his Father comming into Pamphilus his Chamber, to knowe how he had ſucceeded in the execution of his command, found Pamphilus and Theſander together. They demaunded of Theſander what hee was, who anſwered; that he was Pamphilus. Liſard draweth out his Sword inſtantly to kill him, but he was with-held by his Father, who hauing already knowne Pamphilus tolde his ſonne, that the other was Pamphilus. Liſard beleeued that his Father tolde him ſo to appeaſe him, wherefore he fiereely ſtroue to breake away from his Father, that hee might kill Theſander, ſaying that the other was his man Maierice. The whole Family drawne thither by the noyſe, and ſeeing this rage to preuent greater miſchiefe, tanne

vnto the Magiſtrates, who hearing the ſtirre rayſing the Neighbours, layde Pamphilus and Theſander in two ſeuerall Priſons, vntill it was verified which was Pamphilus, for although that Theſander apprehending the danger, began now to ſay that it was not hee, was not beleeued: for all beleeued that feare made him deny his name. In this meane time Iacinth being whole of his wounds, which Pamphilus had giuen him, ſought him all ouer Barcelon, and not finding him, beleeued that he was returned into his owne Countrey, as well to follow him, as hearing that his Lucinda was at Madreele, reſolued to goe thither, and paſſing by Saragoſſa hee found the Pilgrim Niſa, at the entrance of the famous Pillar which was built by the Angels in the time of the Apoſtle, who planted Religion in Spaine, and hauing (by many tokens which Pamphilus had tolde him, and marked her out vnto him) knowne her; hee alſo made himſelfe knowne, for Iacinth. Niſa aſſuring herſelfe of him, out of the Loue which ſhee knewe was betweene him and Pamphilus, betooke her vnto a habite proper vnto her ſexe, and left this Pilgrims apparell at the walles of this Holy houſe; together with her Staffe, which in ſo many dangers and ſuch long wayes had beene ſo faithfull a companion; And ſo trauailing together towards Madreele, Niſa deſired to ſeeke Pamphilus firſt in his owne houſe, whether being come with Iacinth, and finding his ſorrowfull Mother afflicted, for the loſſe of her Children, ſhee comforted her much by the aſſurance which ſhee gaue vnto her, that they were both aliue, and the hope they put her in to finde them at Toledo: The good olde Lady incouraged by theſe

wordes, and perſwaded by Niſa, and the great deſire ſhe had to ſee her Children, tooke her youngeſt daughter Eliza with her, (being her ſtaffe and her comfort in her afflictions, who in her Brothers abſence, had increaſed no leſſe in Beauty then Finia, nor in vnderſtanding then Pamphilus) and went all together to Toledo.
               
               The miſerable Tiberia, Iacinths Siſter, thinking that her treaſon being diſcouered, ſhee ſhould bee hardly vſed by her Brother, as by the diſgrace and danger whereunto ſhe had vniuſtly expoſed him ſhee merited; leaues Valence, and with ſuch of the family as would follow her, ſhee addreſſed herſelfe vnto that Citty, whether Fortune already did ſeeme to call theſe Louers:
               
                  Celio in the meane time diſpayring to finde Finia or ſatisfie Niſa, hee for his part being more then ſatisfied, of both their innocencies, returned to Toledo, and ſome dayes before his comming thether hee met Tiberia, in whoſe company as he iourneyed, he heard newes of the Combate betweene Iacinth and Pamphilus, for which cauſe he offered her his houſe to retire vnto, vntill ſuch time, as that writing vnto her Brother, ſhee had made her peace with him, which might be done by the helpe of his Parents, whoſe helpe and aſſiſtance he promiſed.
               In this manner in one Day, and in one time, entred into the noble Leonicios Houſe; Aureliana, Pamphilus Mother, Niſa, and Eliza, Iacinth, Tiberia, and hee who was moſt diſpaired of, Celio, of whome there was no newes expected, being accounted as Dead, or Captiue as ſome had reported. The ſodaine ioy to ſee Niſa ſo beautifull, and Celio ſo well, ſtronger in this habite then in that which hee had brought home from his ſtudies,

before his peregrination, bound Leonicio to ſhed abundance of teares, and Aureliana could not forbeare when ſhee ſawe her deare Finia ſo long time loſt, and Celio with tender imbracings, demaunded pardon for his cauſeleſſe ſuſpitions, and of Niſa for the wounds which hee had giuen her, being ignorant what ſhe was. There was none diſcontented but Iacinth, who ſeeing his Siſter Tiberia in this company, without knowing how ſhee came thither, would needes take a publique ſatiſfaction before all the world. But the authority of ſo many ſignall perſons not onely ſtayed him, but obtayned pardon from him for his Siſters offence. Theſander and Pamphilus were taken out of Priſon, and then it was quickly known who was the true Pamphilus, whoſe happy finding there, did ſo reioyce the whole company, and the whole Towne, that all the Nobility and Gentry ranne for to ſee him, and reioyce with their Parents for their happy arriuall; Amongſt all which came vnto this happy and Ioyfull welcomming home, faire Lucinda, who was marryed to Iacinth, to ſatisfie the many Obligations wherein ſhee was redueable. Liſard hauing opened his eyes vpon Tiberia's beauty, and by the impreſſion, which the report of Celio's Loue and Finia's made in his minde, cleane wiped away his Affection of that kinde vnto Finia, hee intreated Iacinth to giue her vnto him in Marriage, which was eaſily graunted, and with euery ones conſent. And to comfort Theſander for the Loue which hee bare vnto Niſa, he was Married vnto faire Eliza, Pamphilus Siſter, then about fourteene yeare olde. Celio with Ioy vnto all, marryed Finia. And Niſa after ſo many diuers fortunes, with the Ioy of both

their Parents, (which was ſo full that it melted them into teares, and almoſt all the company) was giuen into the beloued armes of her moſt Deare Pamphilus.
