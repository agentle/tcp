               THe Queenes moſt excellent Maieſtie conſidering that the great & horrrible conſpiracies, treaſons, and rebellions lately practiſed, attempted, and with open action proſecuted in the north partes of her highneſſes Realme by the Earles of Northumberlande and Weſtmerlande, and others their confederates, contrary to the commaundement of Almightie God, and their duties of allegeaunce to their naturall and moſt vndoubted Soueraigne Ladie and Queene, and to the great diſturbyng of the common quiet and peace of this Realme of England, their natiue countrey, be by the great goodneſſe of Almightie God, her Maieſties great prouidence, and the faithfull ſeruice of her true and loyall ſubiectes, diſcouered, fruſtrated, and vtterly ſuppreſſed. And vnderſtandyng by her right truſty and ryght welbeloued coſin the Earle of Suſſex, her Maieſties lieftenaunt generall of thoſe north partes, that ſundrye of the meaner ſort of ſuch as did forciably and rebelliouſly aſſiſt the ſayd rebellious Earles in their trayterous attemptes, haue by the marſhall lawe ſuffered paynes of death accordyng to their iuſt deſertes, and to the terrour and example of others, and that great numbers of her Maieſties common people that were like offenders in that rebellion, do earneſtly repent, and be grieuouſly ſorry for their heynous offences paſt, and do bewayle and lament their vnhappy and miſerable eſtate, and be fully perſwaded and earneſtly bent to bee from hencefoorth faithfull, loyall, and dutifull ſubiectes to her Maieſtie, if it might pleaſe her highneſſe of her royall clemencie to graunt to them their liues and her gratious pardon for their offences paſt, and to receaue them to her grace, in ſuch ſort as may beſt pleaſe her Maieſtie, for the which they wyll acknowledge themſelues bound to her Maieſtie, as her true and naturall ſubiects, and as perſons that haue receaued their liues and beinges from her highneſſe as the miniſter of Almightie God, for the which they bee bounde by double bande to ſerue her Maieſtie faythfully and truely during the continuaunce of their liues to come, and to ſpende in her ſeruice that which from her clemencie they haue receiued. Like as when her Maieſty looketh vpon their greeuous offences and deteſtable actions practiſed and executed in this rebellion againſt her Maieſtie, hauyng neuer geuen to them or any other of her ſubiects (as is well knowne) any occaſion to neglect their dueties in ſuch ſort as they haue done, ſhee is by their vnnaturall dealinges moued to thinke euery of them vnworthy to receiue any drop of her mercie and grace: So her moſt excellent Maieſtie neuertheleſſe laying apart that rigour wherunto they haue iuſtly prouoked her, and followyng that naturall inclination that ſhe hath euer been diſpoſed vnto in ſhewing of mercie, and hoping there with vpon report made to her higneſſe, that the common ſort of her ſubiectes lately in this rebellion, doe in deede ſee howe wikkedly they haue beene ſeduced, and do know and repent from the bottome of their hearts their offences towardes God and her Maieſtie, and wyll from hencefoorth be faythfull and true ſubiectes to her Maieſtie: doth by this her Maieſties Proclamation, graunt and giue her free pardon of lyfe to all and euery ſuch of her ſubiectes within the Counties of Yorke, Duriſme, Northumberlande, Cumberlande, and Weſtmerland, who neither hath at this preſent, nor heretofore hath had any landes, tenementes, or hereditamentes of any eſtate of inheritance, and that they, and euery of them, as aboue is ſayde, ſhall remaine and continue without any arreſt, vexation or diſturbaunce to bee done by any of her Maieſties officers, and miniſters, or any other perſon to their bodies or goodes, ſo that euery ſuch ſubiect do repaire to the ſaide Earle of Suſſex her Maieſties Liefetenuant, and other her highneſſes Commiſſioners appoynted for thoſe cauſes, within fourtie dayes next after the publication hereof, and doe ſubmit himſelfe to all ſuch orders and directions as by the ſaid Commiſſioners ſhalbe appointed. Whereupon euery ſuch ſubiect ſhall receiue a note in writting vnder the handes of the ſayde liefetenaunt and other the ſayd Commiſſioners, or three of them, teſtifying his ſubmiſſion, which ſhall be a ſufficient waraunt to the Lord keper of the great ſeale of Englande for paſſing of his pardon vnder the great ſeale, without any further ſpeciall byll or warraunt to bee obtained for the ſame from her Maieſtie, ſo as he do ſue out the ſame within three moneths after the date of the ſame note.
            Prouided alwayes, that this her Maieſties pardon do not extende to any perſon nowe out of the Realme, or in priſon, or committed to the cuſtodie of any perſon, or deliuered vpon baile, promiſe, or other to appeare at any day or tyme: nor to any perſon that hath had (as aboue is ſayd) any lands tenementes, or hereditaments, of any ſtate of inheritaunce.
            Gyuen at our honour of Hampton Courte the xviii. day of Februarie, in the yere of our Lorde God. 1569. and in the twelfth yere of our Raigne.
            
            God ſaue the Queene.
