            To the Reader.
            
               BOokes are a strange commoditie, the
estimation of them riseth and falleth
faster then the exchange of money in
the Low countries, which alters more
often then the english man doth the
fashion of his apparell. Men that
write to feede fantastike humors, are
no better then Apes, that shew their
trickes to others, the doing of which is painefull to themselues,
and at going away are but laught at, and so nice
are our Paules Churchyard-walkers in beholding these
pictures, that to day they cry excellent at the drawing of
that, vpon which to morrow they will cast a mewing
countenance, ther's no one Stationer stall can fit all
customers with bookes to their dyet, nor can all men
that write (if all that can but speake should write) fit some
Stationers. Go to one and offer a coppy, if it be merrie,
the man likes no light stuffe, if sad, it will not sell. Another
meddles with nothing but what fits the time, I wold
haue his shop stuft with nothing but proclamations, because
he lyes i'th winde only for the change of weather.
Since therefore that neither hot nor colde can please, neither
straight nor crooked, can serue as a measure, to some
mouthes; what a miserable and endlesse labour does he
vndertake that in a few scribled sheetes hopes to wrap vp
the loues of all men. Better it were for him in my iudgement

to turne his leaues into such paper-kites as boyes
runne after, whilest they flye in the Ayre, then to publish
his wits in Follio, and yet be counted but a foole
for his labour.

                notwithstanding, with such a tickling
Itch is this printed Ambition troubled, that some are neuer
at better ease then when they are scratching vpon
paper, and finde no sweetnesse but in drawing blood.

much sorry, because the Cooke knew not your dyet,
so that his error was his ignorance, and ignorance is a
veniall sinne to be pardoned.

               A Iustice of Peace found his man laying his mistresse on

out a great oath, cald him Rascall, and asked him what he did,

a good lusty Seruingman, & one hopefull to haue some purchase
in his pocket would serue his turne, if he could get it, stept
to him, and as he wisht gaue him a little Iustle: and withall,

Gentleman, of my fashion with thy purse, as they were at these
words, being spoke against a great faire House, where some
great personage dwelt, comes me a Coatch whirring on the
suddaine, and there made a stand, to discharge his burthen at
that lodging, when as the Lady dismounted, the foyst béeing exceeding
gallant, tooke occasion by the hand, stept to her, caught
her by the arme, and lead her in, leauing the f

lost his money or no.
            The foyst by this time had brought in the Lady, where after
some curtes
                  •

the gentlewoman in as strange wonder who it should bée

she should forget in what place was begun their acquaintance.
(when indéede her eies and his did neuer parle together before)
yet gessing by his habite, he could be a man worthy of no lesse
then that kindnesse, a kisse which she had receiued, she past it
ouer.
            By this time the foyst was come back to the seruingman, &
roūdly began to tell him, that now he had brought in his honourable
Aunt, he should know he had done him wrong, to charge
him with his purse, he would fight with him, y•

withall answered the foyst, I am as sure thou presumptuously

The fellow halfe angred for the losse of his money, entertaind
this offer: and into Tuttle fields they went where they had not
changed past halfe a dussen thrusts, but the foyst had hurt him
in the arme, and so they gaue ouer, but ere they parted, the foist
puts his hand into his pocket, told out twenty shillings of his
money, and speaking to the fellow, sayd that hee should see hee
would proue himselfe a Gentleman, since he had but him, there
was so much for him, & so sent him to the Chirurgio
                  •
               s, the seruingman
praysing his resolution and minde of a Gentleman,
they so parted, the seruingman with thanks, and the foyst with
this Impudent bost.
            
               If this were not a trick to shift a foole.
               A more knaue learne mee, and Ile go to schoole.
            
            But now to the manner of the foysting of a pocket, the sharing
of the money, and how honest men may auoide them. First
know your pocket is drawne vp, that he may the easier come by
your purse with two fingers, onely the fore-finger and the middle,
and with that forke, he cetches hold not of the lining, nor
on the side next your skin, but the other: for if hee should faste
                  •
               
on that ne
                  •
               t your thigh, he were in danger you would feele
him sooner then on the other. When hauing drawne your pocket
vp, till he can reach your purse, it is then gon with the least
twitch nay by this meanes of drawing, If your money be loose,
they will turne you the case cleane out, and the bit, into their
hands, now for the sharing of this bit, as they call it, your Stall
is equall part with your foyst, if the foyst his none, which is
shift some aside, ere they come to sharing, but your snap has his
wages at their discretion.
            For the manner to auoide them, though their cunning bee
great, it is very easie, which is, if euer you take any, to hang
them, and let not this composition preuaile with you, for that
meane of compounding with the aduersarie, hath béene like an

            Thus hoping that this instruction will in Citie and country,

fayers, and méetings, to kéepe honest mens money in their
purses, and pickpockets, poore Cock VVatt will onely discouer
a word or two of the mill, quasi breakhouse, and so go to
bed, you Mill or breakhouse, to whome your broker is your
onely vpholder, and merchant to transport his commodities,
whereas all other théeues worke in the day, hee onely sleepes
in the day and toyles in the night, there is of these as of
Foysts and Lifts, both men and weomen, whose Instruments
are either little Iron hookes, which are called picklocks, and
they that vse thē termed Iunglers or a strong Iron barre made
sharpe at one end, and they which trade with that, are called
Mils, withall a boy to créepe in at a crushard or small hole, which
they make or finde.
            The time that they go forth, is about one or two a Clock
in the morning, at which houre commonly the watches are
discharged. They lightly set forth foure in number, of which
the Boy is one, when if they haue in the day taken note of any
casement, without a speere going vp in the middle, if there
be either signe-post, or pent-house about, thither doe they vpp
                  •
               n
their hands and shoulders lift vp the Boy, who beeing
brought vp for the purpose, presently créepes in, then two of
them beneath go to stand Centinell at each end of the stréete,
and the third waites to receiue whatsoeuer the Boy shall throw
out.
            If they breake a sellor or a shop window, they doe the like,
but it alwaies followes not, that these burglaries haue a Boy:
for somtimes they are all men, but then are they associated with
an excelling iugler, a fellow that will pick you open a lock, as
soone as a man will blow his nose, he has the power of Gun-pouder,
he will blow them open, but not with halfe so much
noyse. This fellow opens the dore, if not bolted on the inside, &
makes easie entrance, who where euer they finde to the fullest
burthen, they take away, the distribution whereof, this is some
parte to the punck, and the rest to the Broker.
            Now if this robbery shall extend to forty, fifty, or a hundred
pound, If none of it be money, but apparrell or commodities

she is so Imbusied away in the suddaine, so altered, so transported
from one to another, that if the looser take not his theeues,
within two or thrée daies, he shall find his goods bought & sold,

               OUr Newgate-Bird (whose notes you haue heard
before) spreading his Dragon-like wings, (which
with a horred & a fainting sound, brake open the
Ayre before him) rested himselfe in his flight, on
he tops of many other pollutes houses, and looking
downe (sometimes through chimneys, and
sometimes in at dormer windows that stood gaping wide open
to swallow vp the ayre,) he beheld a thousand Synnes, that in
the shapes of Bats, Skréech-owles, and such other ominous mid
night-walkers, wasted the bawdy night in shameles and godlesse
Reuilings, but in the day-time, like snailes they lye couer'd,
hiding in causes their vgly and deformed heads. Of all which
hee taking notes, with purpose to sing their liues openly
to the world, when he is perfect in their tunes, hee spent all the
next day in a theeuish thicket, not far from the Citie, to practise
the straynes by himselfe, but the Sun going to bed, being his

much about the houre when spirits begin their round) did he enter
the citie, and passing by a Tauerne doore, he might behold a
tumultuous crew, (like drunken waues) reeling from one side to
the other; the whirlewinde that raiz'd this tempest, beeing
nothing else then the clapping of one on the shoulders that
was watcht for when he came out of his cup, you would haue
thought the Allarum had beene giuen, and that the Citie had

béene in an vprore, for you might heare the clashing of swords,
the hacking of bils, and such a confuses noise, as if all the Diuels

to dig out the Prisoner. Nay a Prison does yet come nearer to
a Campe, by many degrées, & can shew farre more noble markes
of it than the former: for Prisoners lye as hard as Soldiers,
drinck as hard as soldiers, sweare as hard as souldiers, goe as
tattered as soldiers, are as louzy as soldiers, as discontent as
soldiers, go cursing vp and downe as brauely as soldiers, and
to conclude, are as little regarded as soldiers.

are the cunning pilots that in all stormes bring men safely to

by, is the Law, which is toucht by the Loadstone of Reason; the
poynts of that compasse, are the customs of the Cittye, vppon
