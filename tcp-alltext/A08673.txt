            IMPRINTED at London in Fleetestrete, neare vnto Sainct Dunstones Church, by Thomas Marsh. 1580. Cum Priuilegio.
         
         
            
            The occasion of this Booke.
            
               OF Ouidius Naso his banishment, diuers occasions be supposed: but the commō opinion and the most likely is, that Augustus Caesar thē Em perour, reading his Bookes of the Arte of Loue, misliked thē so much, that he condemned Ouid to exile. After which time the sayd Ouid aswel in his passage on the Sea, as after arriued in the Barbarous countries, the rather to recouer the Emperours grace, wrote these Elegies, or Lamentable verses, directing some to the Gods, some to Caesar, some to his wife, some to his Daughter, some to his Frendes, some to his foes, &c. And called this booke, the booke of Sorowes: In latin de Tristibus.
         
         
            
            TO HIS MOST ASSVred and tryed Friende Maister Christopher Hatton Esquire, Thomas Churchyarde wysheth continuaunce of Vertue.
            
               
                  AS I haue greate desyre to perfourme my promise touching my whole workes of English Verses, good maister Hatton, so I wish my selfe able euerye waye to keepe the worthinesse of your Frendship, which many haue tasted, and few can fynd fault withall: such is the eeuē
               nesse of your dealinges, and the vpright behauiour of the same. VVel, least I should seeme to vnfolde a fardle of Flattrie, I retourne to my matter My booke being vnreadye, considering I was commaunded (by a great and mighty parsonage) to write ye same againe, I am forced in the meane whyle to occupy your iudgement with the reading of another mans worke, whose doings of it self, are sufficiēt to purchase good report, albeit it wanted such a Patron as you are to defende it. The rest of that woorke which as yet is not come forth, I purpose to pen and set out, crauing a litle leasure for the same. And surely sir, I blush that myne owne booke beares not a better Tytle, but the basenes of the matter wil not suffer it to beare any higher

name, than Churchyardes Chyps: for in the same are sondry tryfles composed in my youth, and such fruicte as those dayes and my simple knowledge coulde yelde, so that the aptest name for such stuffe, was as I thought, to geue my workes this Title, to be called Churchyardes Chips (to warme the wittes of his welwillers.) In my first booke shalbe three Tragedies, two tales, a Dreame, a description of Frendship, a Farewell to the Court, the siege of Leeth and sondry other thinges yt are already written. And in my seconde Booke shalbe foure Tragedies, ten Tales, the Siege of Saint Quintaynes, Newhauen, Calleis, and Guynes, and I hope the rest of all the sorrein warres, that I haue seene or heard of abroade, shall follow in another volume.
            Thus commending this little present to your cōsideration, I trouble you not long with the tediousnes of my Epistle, and wishing you muche worshippe, good 
                  •
               ame and blessed fortune, I bydde you moste hartely farewell.
            
               Yours in all at commaundement. Thomas Churchyarde.

                  all goe.
               O cruell chaunce, y• where thou goest, thy maister may not so.
               Goe now thy way: yet sute thy selfe, in sad and simple geare,
               Such exiles weede as time requyre, I wil y• thou do weare.
               No vastie Uiolet shalt thou vse, nor robe of Purple hue,
               Those costly coulours be vns

               With ruddy red dye not thy face, nor sappe of Ceder tree,
               Such outward hu
                     •
                   see that thou haue, as cause assignes to thee.
               Frounce not thy fearefull face I say, nor haplesse head to streke,
               But roughe and rugde so shew in sight that pity may prouoke.
               Those subtill sleights be much more meete, for volumes voyde of paine
               But thou of my vnfrendly fate a myrror must remayne.
               Be not abasht thy ruefull blots, to set and shew in sight,
               That of my teares men may them iudge, to haue beene made a right.
               Depart thy way and in my name, salute those blessed bowers,
               When as thy fearefull foote shall fall, in Caesars stately towers.
               If any be (as some there are) amongst the rurall route,
               Forgetlesse frends shall aske for mee, or ought shall seeme to doubte.
               Say that I liue: which as I do, by force of heauenly might,
               So do confesse my troubled state, wherein thou sees me plight:
               If further speach shall thee prouoke, or other skill they craue,
               I charge thee then to take good heede: no wastfull wordes to haue.
               My faulty facts if any shall, reproue perhaps to thee,
               Or dolefull deedes in publike place condempned chaunce to be

                  .
               Spend thou no speach, nor do not care, tho threatning browes they bēde,
               A rightfull cause it hindreth oft, with wordes if we defend.
               Some shalt thou finde that wil bewayle, me thus in exile sent,
               And reading thee with trickling teares, my carefull case lament.
               And in their muttring mindes will wish (least wicked men may heare)
               That Caesars yre once set a syde, from paynes I may be cleare.
               To such therefore as wel do wish, to vs that payne do proue,
               To mighty Ioue wee pray likewyse, like sorrowes to remoue.

               Doth wish my lothsome life to ende, where life I first begonne.
               A worke vnworthy of my witte, of thee some men will iudge.
               And doing that I thee requyre, at thee likewyse shall grudge.
               
                  Yet ought a Iudge as well to time▪ as matte

                   haue regarde.
               Which if ye haue (as I do hope) thou sasely shalt be harde.
               For pleasaunt berses do proceede, from quiet resting brayne,
               But soden sorrowes mee assaultes, with hugie heapes of

               A minde more free from feare it askes, in deadly doubt I stand,
               Least that my life with sword be reft, by force of enemyes hand.
               Yet some there are that maru

                  ile will, and rightfull Iudges bee,
               When they this meane and simple verse, with equall eyes shall see.
               For though that Homer yet did liue, with sorrowes so be set,
               His wonted wits through malyce mighte, I feare he should forget.
               Yet shewe thy selfe (my seely booke) without regard of fame,
               Nor though percase thou doest displease, let it not thee ashame.
               Syth fortune so vnfrendly is to hope it were in vayne,
               That thou therby should purchase prayse to make therof thy gayne.
               Whyle fortune smyld with smirking chere of fame I had desyre,
               And noted name on euery syde, I sought for to acquyre
               A fayned verse lo now I make, and hate my hurtful lore,
               Let it suffice, sith that my wit forsaketh me therfore.
               Yet goe thou one and in my steede the royall Rome to see
               God graunt that there is none of myne, they may account of thee.
               And though thou there a straunger be, thinke not vnknowen to come
               But that amids the mighty towne thou shalt be knowen to some.
               Thy colour wil disclose thy craft, althoughe thou weare no name,
               By depe deceite▪ or otherwyse by skill to cloake the same.
               In priuy wyse yet passe thou in my verse may els offend,
               The wonted grace it clearly wantes, which I to verse did lend.
               To reade as myne if any shal, vnworthy therfore deeme,
               And from his handes to cast away to the by hap shal seeme,
               Tel then thy name: thou art not he of loue that taught the lore,
               That wicked worke hath felt the paynes that it deseru'd before.
               Perhaps thou lookst I should thee bid the pallace proude to clyme,

               And be content that thou be red in priuate place aboute.

               An ydle tyme if thou espye, when ceased is debate,
               And when all ire is pacifyed, and turnd to frendly state.
               Some doubting thus with feareful face wil thee perhaps present,
               So hee with wordes thy way haue made, then go where thou art sent.
               More happy hap god graunt thou haue, and far more lucky day,
               Then I haue had, when thou come there, our sorrowes to allay.

               Yet when vnto my homly house, thou shalt returne to mee,
               And in thy croked shryne be set, a place made meete for thee.
               Thy brethren there thou shalt behold, in order seemely set,
               One only father all they had, whom he by skill beget.
               The rest that therin sight do show by signes thou may decerne,

               But that I feare it might be cause▪ to longe that thou abyde.
               For if nothing that comes to minde, from thee I should detayne.
               A burden farre more huge thou were, then bearers could sustayne.

               ¶ Hee departeth from Rome, remembreth the teares of his Wyfe, and freendes. Elegie. 3.
               WHen I the pensiue picture see, of darcke and drery night,
               And in my minde behold the towne, from whēce I toke my flight.
               Or time record, when I did leaue▪ my friendes and dere allyes,
               Then do the dolefull drops discend, from my sad weeping eyes.
               The day drue on I should depart, as Caesar wild before,
               And flee a farre to partes extreame, and shun Italia shore.
               No time or perfit space I had, nor minde for prayer prest,
               And drowsines by long delay, had crept in carefull brest.
               No men there were to waight on mee, no care I had to reede,
               No garmentes meete for myne estate, nor wealth to serue my neede,
               I was astoyn'de: as hee that feeles the force of lightning flame,
               Who thinckes he were of life bereft, and yet enioyes the same,
               But when this cloude of minde was gone, by sorrow set asyde,
               And that my sences did returne, in former health to bide,
               At last my sory friendes I spake, when I away did pas,
               Which of a number that I had, but one or two there was.
               My louing wyfe all weeping thus, me weeping did sustaine,
               Till that by her vnworthy cheekes, a shoure of teares did rayne,
               My daughter deare was farre away, in coast of Libia land,
               And of my fate no word she knew, nor cause could vnderstand.
               A yelling and a crying noyse did sound on euery syde,
               No secret forme of funerall, within my house did byde.
               The man the Wyfe, the blamelesse babe, my dolefull death do

               If we doubt not our matters small, by greater thinges make playne,
               As Troy when it was tane, so we in like estate remayne.
               Now whisted was the voyce of men, of dogges and euery wight,
               And Cynthea ledde the horses then, that rul'de the darckesome night.
               I lookinge vp, did cast myne eyes, the Senate house to see,
               Which next our carefull cot in vaine, was built in good degree.
               And sayd (O Gods) that here do rest, and neerest neighbours bee,
               O stately Temples whom myne eyes, henceforth shall neuer see.
               And you O heauenly goasts I leaue, in lofty Rome to dwell.

                   of shape trāsform'de, which likewise I haue left,
               Which at their maisters funerall, with force were all bereft.
               That worke might well if that in mee my life so longe had last,
               From heauy hand amended more with greater fame haue past.
               But now all vncorrupted quite in peoples mouth doth fall,
               If that in peoples dayly speache, my name be told at all.
               And to my bookes I know not how, which hap into thy hand.
               Adde this: although now lately sent, from vnacquainted land.
               That who then reads in reading them, will presuppose before,

               To writinges mine more pardon farre, a righteous Iudge will show,
               If that them made in exil'de time, and barbarous land he know.
               In such mishaps he marueyle will, how verses I could write,
               Or how my carefull hand set forth, the words I did endite.
               My sundry woes my wits haue broke, of which longe time before,
               The fountayne dry and sclender vaine, appeared euermore.
               Yet (as it was) with want of vse, is now consum'de away,
               And with long thrist to drines driuen, sustered more decay.
               No store of bookes to feede my wit, in Scythia coast be founde,
               But in their place the shootinge bowes and arrowes do resounde.
               No learned mates for conference, do liue within this lande,
               That hath the skill my verse to reade, or eares to vnderstande.
               No space is here to roame aside, that watch on wall which goes,
               And gate vpshut keepers of the Getes, our deadly dreaded foes.
               Enquiry oft I make of wordes, of place or of some name,
               Nor any man is present here, by whom I certaine ame.
               Not seldome I enforce to speake, to shamefull to confesse,
               My wonted wordes will fayle me then, which I forgetting cesse.
               With Thracian talke and Geta rude, my eares be stopped quite,
               Mee seemeth now I able am, in Getian wise to wryte,
               Beleeue mee least with Latin they be mixed sore I dread,
               And least my writinge while thou vewe, the Pontus wordes do read.
               And to my booke such as it is, in reading pardon giue,
               And eke excused haue the same, by lot of ly e I liue.
