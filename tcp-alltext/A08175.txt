The rype Figge is of much more prayſe than the figge that is not ripe, the dry figge is colder than the greene, ſo that he cometh to the ſecond degree, and is ſubtile, and inſciſſiue: of the great vſe of them commeth not very good bloud: one diſcommodity of them is, that they cauſe the body to bee full of Lyce: if the ſtomacke be full of euill humours they doe much hurt, for ſhortly they be corrupted. Although the dry Figge bee ſubtill and inſciſſiue, yet it hurteth the Lyuer and ſplene that is enflamed, and ſo doth the greene figge alſo: therefore when the Lyuer or ſplene is abſtructed or hath opilations, figges be eaten before other meates

wyth Tyme, Peniroiall, Sauery, Calamint, Pepper, or Ginger, and ſuch like: who ſo eateth ye greene or dry figges after groſſe meates, doth incurre domage. The dry fig is a medicine to the outwarde partes, and doth mature and rype hard ſwellings, and the ſame in ſhort ſpace doth reſolue, and the decoction of them alſo: but when yee wyll more mature or rype than reſolue, wheaten flower is to be mixed with them. And when you will more reſolue than mature, ye flower of Barly bread mixed with them is of ye meane operation betweene ryping and reſoluing. The fatter the figge is, the more it doth mature or rype. The ſharper and heatter, the more it doth reſolue. The greene Fygge, by reaſon of the ſuperfluous moyſtures, is weaker than the dry Fygge, but both doe laxe the belly. Fygges decocted to the thickneſſe and ſubſtaunce of bonny are of the ſame vertue that Honny is, the figge decocted with Iſope purge the Breaſt, and is good agaynſte longe and colde coughes, and diſeaſes of the Loonges.

                  geale and waxe groſſe, & therefore it is refuſed in Glyſters, to ceaſe paines and freatinges in the lower Gut: Gooſe greaſe is hoater and more ſubtill: the greaſe of the Cocke & Hen is of a meane betwixt ſwynes greaſe, & Gooſe greaſe. The Lyons greaſe is hoateſt, & moſt ſubtill. Bulles ſewet is ye meane betwixte Swynes greaſe, & Lyons greaſe.

               Molke contayneth in it three ſubſtaūces. The Curde, the Butter, & the Whay. Mylke of it ſelfe is a good nouriſhment, the whay is abſterſiue, and laxeth the belly: the curde is groſſe and cleauing, or ſtoping of poares: and therefore it tempereth ye ſharpneſſe of other medycines. Butter is maturatyue, & reſolutiue of ſwellinges: Mylke with Peable ſtones or Iron fyered, and ertincte in the ſame, is good for the bloudy Flure, and ſharpe rhewmes in the Belly: Mylke is alſo good againſt rhewmes of the Eyes, vlcerations of the Loonges, and of all inwarde partes. The Aſſes mylke is thynneſt: the Cowe mylke groſſeſt: the goates mylke of a meane ſubſtaunce: moſt temperate mylke is womans mylke: nexte to that goates mylke, then followeth Aſſes mylke, ſhéepes mylke, & cowe mylke. Milke that hath moſt of whay & leſſe of curde, is to all perſons of leſſe perill, as the milke that hath moſt curde & leſſe whay is moſt daungerous for them yt haue opilations of the liuer, or ſplene. Milke is not good for them yt haue weake heads & wyndy ſtomacks. Much vſe of milke doth periſh ye teeth, & ſpecially

that milke which hath moſt curdes: therefore after milke, ye teeth ought to be waſhed wyth hunny and water.
