                  FIue & twenty bokis of the olde testamet ben bokis of feith, and fulli bokis of holy wryt. The fyrste is Genesis. the. ii. Exodi. the. iii. Lenitici, the. iiii. Numeri, y•. v. Deutronomi. And these fyue ben ye bokis of Moses: the whych ben cleped proprely, the law. The vi. Iosue, the vii. boke is Iudicum: that encloseth the stort of Ruth. The viii. boke, ix. x. xi▪ xii. & xiii: ben the. iiii. bokes of kyngs, and the tweie bokes of Paralipomenō The xiiii. boke is Esore, that cōprehendeth Neemy. And all is do bokeAnentis. is Wyth. anentis Hebreus, as Ierom seith. But anentis Grekis & Latins: these ben tweie bokis. The xv. is Hester, the xvi. is Iob, the xvii. is ye Psalter The xviii. boke. xix, and xx: ben the thre bokes of Solomō. The first is Prouerbes, either Parables, the. ii. Ecclesiastes, and the iii. is songis of

sōgs The xxi. boke xxii, xxiii. & xxiiii. bē y•. iiii. great prophets. Esaiis first Ieremie is the. ii. Ezechiel is the. iii. and Daniel is y• iiii. The xxv, boke is a boke of xii. smale Prophetis. Osee, Ioel, Amos, Abdie, Ionas, Michee, Naū, Abacuke Sophonie Aggei, Zachari & Malachie: and al these xii. smal Prophets bē oo boke & in this order. And what euer boke is in ye olde testamēt wythont these xxv. forseyde: shal be set amōg Apocripha, that is withoutē autoritie of bileue. Therfore the boke of Wysdome Ecclesiastici Iudith and Tobie, ben not of bileue. The first boke of Machabeis was foūdē writtun in Hebru. And y•. ii. boke of Machabeis: was writen fyrst in Greeke. Ierome seyth al this sentence in the prolog on the first boke of Kynges. Also, y• boke of Baruk, and y• Epistil of Ieremi: bē not of the autoritie of y• bible anemis Hebrus ne y• praiere

of Manasses, as Ierom witnesseth. And how mich of yt boke of He ster & Daniel is of autoriti anentis Hebreis, & in hebru lettre: it is tolde in ye same bokes by Ierom himsilfe Netheles, Ierom in suing Hebrus, cōprehendeth al these bokes in. xxii. for Hebrus, makē oo boke of ye first and y•. ii. boke of Kyngis, and clepen it Samuel.

But certis lytil charg is of this rekning, whether ye bokis of Kyngis ben nn̄ bred foure, as latinis don: either. ii. as Hebrus done. Also littil charge is, whether Paralipomenō be departed in two bokis, as latinis vsen: or be oo boke alone, as Hebrus vsen. And so of ye fyrst boke of Esdras & Neeinie, litil charge is, whether thei ben tweyne as latynis and grekis vsē: either one

But howe euer these bokes bē noūbred: al these bē of autoriti of bileue either of christē feith.

two maners: as Catholicō seython this word Apocripha. A boke is seyde Apocriphū, either for y• autour is vn knowē & the truth therof is open, & holi chirch receiueth such a boke, not to preuing of feith, but to lernyng of vertues, & such bē the bokes of Iudith & other which. s. Ierōe nūbreth in the prolog on Regū: either a boke is seid apocriphū, for me doutith of the truth therof, & holy chirch receiueth not suche bokes. And such ben the boke of the younge chyldehoode of the Sauiour, & the boke of the ta kynge vp of the body of seint Mari to heuene. Catholicon seyth this on that worde Apocripha. But sothely all the bokes of the newe testament that is foure Gospellers, Mathew Mark, Luke, and Iohn, xii. epistles of Poule, seuē smale epistlis, the dedes of Apostles, and the Apocalips ben fulli of autoritie of byleue.
               Therfore christē men & womē, olde

and young, shoulden study fast in y• new testament, for it is of ful autoritie, and open to vnderstondyng of simple men, as to the poyntes that most ben nedfull to saluacion. And the same sētence is in ye derkest places of holi wrytte, bothe open and derke, whych sentence is in the open places. And eche place of holi writte bothe open and derke: teacheth meknes & charitie. And therfore he that kepeth meknes & charitie: hath the trew vnderstōding & perfectiō of all holi write, as Austine preueth in his sermō of ye preising of charite.

Therfore, as it is open Heresye to seye that the gospel wyth hys truth and fredom suffysith not to chrysten mens saluacion wythouten kepyng of cerimonies of godis lawe yeouū to Moises: so it semeth open heresy to sey that the gospel with his fredō and treuth suffisith not to saluacion of chrysten men wythoute kepynge of cerimonies and statutis of sinful menne and vnkunnynge, that benne made in the tyme of Sathanas and of Antichriste.

                  SImple men of wit moune be edified to heauēly lyueing, by reading and knowyng of the olde testament. For in the beginyng of Genesis thei moun knowe howe God made heauen and earth and al the creaturs of nought, & made man to hys owne Image and liknes and to haue blisse in body and soule, wythouten anye ende. Also men may know how sore God punished Adā & Gue for breakyng his cōmaundement, And how Abel pleased God by feyth, meknes and charitie: and howe Cayn displesed hym by sinnes, & specially by enuie, hatred, and manquellinge. Also howe Noe was loued of God, and al the worlde (outakē. viii. persons) was distroyed for synne. And howe for pryde and other synnes, God departyd many langagis: that noman vnderstode other in y• tour of Babel And howe feythfull and obedyente

to God Abraham was that he yede out of hys londe into a straung coū
                  tre & was redy to slea his owne son I saac, at the wil of God, & gat therfore myche rewarde of God. And howe God distried Sodome & Gomorre and other iii. Cities, for lecherie and other synnes, that tho were sunke downe, & the dead sea is now where tho greate Cites weren.
               Also howe true and obediēt to God weren Isaac, Iacob & Ioseph: and howe God kepte hem in al periles. All thys processe of Genesis should styr christen men, to be feithfull, and forto drede and loue God: and in all thynges dohys wyll.
               Also in Exodi mē mai knowe howe God kepte hys symple Puple in Egypte, and encreased hem greatly in that londe, vnder the persequucion & tyrantry of kyng Pharao, & deliuered hem bi mani miracles, & punished Pharao & hys puple wyth tenne

strong vengeaunces, and fedde hem meruilousli in desert. xl. yers, where no dwellynge of men was before, and made hē to ouercome the strōg puple of Amalech. After thys God taught hē wyse gouernaile, & bitoke to hem the ten cōmaundements and other iudiciallis to punyshe greatly open greate sinnes. And they weren ful bisi to make a costlue tabernacle to the honoure of God by hys bydding & teching: y• figured holy chirch & vertuis in mens soulis. At the last God toke greate vēgeaūce on hem for Idolatry: whā they forsokē the feyth and worshipyng of God, and honoreden yeotun caluys by styring of the deuyl. And then Moses was a trewe mediatour bytwyx God & the synfull puple: and seyde thus to God, for greate tryst of hys mercie and for ryghtfulnes and greate charitie to y• puple. Either forgiue thou thys trespas to hem: eyther do me

And this proces of Exodie should make mē cristi in godes helpe & to be true in hys loue, & Eschew his offēce wt al here mightes

At the last, thys boke teacheth mē to kepe Goddes hestes & forto loue here neyghboures and to do equitie to hem, and werkis of mercye to nedy men, and cōmaūdeth iuste weightes & measures & domis and for byddeth strongly Idolatrie and wytchcrafte & false coniutinges and telleth prosperiti that shal come to hem that kepen Goddes hestes, and vengeaunce & peine to hem that breaken Goddes hestes.

               The. v. boke clepyd deutronomie:Deuteronomi. is a rehersynge and cōfirmyng of all the law afore going, and styreth mē gretly to kepe & teach goddes hests, and adnothing to tho, neither draw awaye any thyng fro tho. And first it teacheth, that wyse men & mighty

shoulden be made iudges, and deme ryght the pore and the ryche. Afterwarde, howe the Iewes ouercamē Deon the King of Esebō, and token hys londe and all the goodes therin, into here owne possession, and dyden in like maner to Og ye king of Basā, and to hys londe and goodes, Forthermore God cōmaundeth men to kepe hys heestes: and adde nothynge therto, neyther drawe nothing therfro, and y• they drede and loue God of all here hert and of all here soule, and al here strength, & eschew Idolatrie, and serue and worshipe hym alone, and that theye teache goddis heestes, to here sonnes & thyncke on tho hests in howese and wey, sleping and wakinge. Also God cōmaūdeth hys puple to eschewe weddingis of heathen men & womē to here childer lest they be drawne to Idolatri, and bihetith mani blessinges to hem and myehe encreasyng of goodes, if they

Also they shoulen distroye the places wherin heathen men dydden Idolatrie, & distrie here auters, Images, wodes and Idolis. And they shulen make here sacrifices and offer here tythys and the first frutes and yeftes, and auowes: in the place whych the lorde hath chosen to hys name, and thys was the temple of Ierusalem. Also a prophete either a feyner of dreames that stirreth men to do Idolatri: shalbe slayne, and so shall a frende, either citie, that doeth Idolatrie▪ eyther styrreth other men therto. Also thou shalt pay tythis of all fruites that growen in the earth, of wheete, of wyne, of oyle: and the first borne things of neete and shepe And in the thrid yere, y• shalt depart another tith of al thinges yt growen

to thee, and kepe it within thy yates, to susteine the dekin, pilgrime either comlyng, fatherlesse chylde eyther motherlesse: and wyde we that bene wythin thy yeates. Also in the. vii, yere shalbe remission of dette to citisens and kynsmen, netheles, not to a pylgryme & comelynge, for he maie be cōpelled to paye. Utterly a nedye man and begar shall not be amonge Goddes puple: but pore men shoulen not faile in the londe. Therefore, rychemen shoulen helpe hem wyth loue: and helpe hem wylfully in here nede. Than God teacheth of three greate solemnities, Of paske, of the feast of wokes either Pētecoste: of the feaste of Tabernacles, and that maisters & iudges sholen be ordeyned in all yates eyther cities by eche linage, to deme y• puple bi iuste dō

               Then God teacheth what maner kyng the puple shal make: and what shal be his office. Afterwarde God teacheth that priestis and dekynys, and all that bene of the same linage: shoulen not haue parte and herytage wyth the residue puple of Israel. For thei shoulen eate the sacrifices of the lorde, and the offrings of him and thei sholē take none other thinge of the possession of here britherne. For whye, God hym selfe is her heritage.

                  māded him to kepe al ye law & how not fro it: but thincke therin by days and nyghtes, that he kepe & do tho things that ben writen therin. After this, Iosue sent aspies: to behold the londe & the Citie of Ierico, and they entriden in the house of a cōmon woman Raab: and weren sauyd there, by counsel and helpe of the woman. Thā Iosue bade the priests take the Arke of the bond of peace of the lord and go bifore the puple, & thei diden so. And whanne the priestis camen and broughten the arke to the brink

of Iordan: y• great water of Iordā wente aweie to the dead sea, and the hygher waters stoden styl as a wal, so that the puple passed by the drie bottome, and the priestis stoden on the drie earth in the myds of Iordā. Also Iosue bade. xii. men of the. xii. linages of Israel, take. xii. grete stones fro the bottome of Iordan: and set tho in Galgalis, where the puple settid tētis in the next night after the passyng of Iordan: & take. xii. stonis of the lond and put in the middis of Iordan, where the Arke had stond, and bade that fathers shulden teach here children howe they passeden by the drie bottome of Iordan, for god dried the waters thereof, as he had do before in the red sea. And the priestis & prynces and al the puple obeiden to Iosue. Than Iosue circumcidid the puple that was vncircumci dyd. xl. yeres in deserte: & the Puple made pask in the. xiiii. day of the moneth

at euentide. And Iosue seeth an Angel of the lord, which angel was prince of goddis oost. Also the strōg wallis of Iericho feldene downe at goddis ordenaunce, whane priestis braiden wyth seuen trumpis, and al the puple cried anhigh in the. vii. dai of cumpasyng of the citie. And the puple of Israel dystroyed and brent the cittie and al things therein: outaken Raab and tho that werene in hir house, and outaken golde and syluer and vessel of brasse and Irun: whych they haloweden in to the tresorye of the lorde. Also, for Achior did ayens goddis bydding and toke to him silf a thynge reserued to goddis vse: he was stonid & brent & al hys goods weren brent wyth hym. And al this punysheyng was done on hyme: for afor this the puple of Israel might not stonde but was ouercūe of here enimyes. After thys punyshynge of Achior, Iosue toke the citie of Haie,

and kylled the kynge and all the puple and distryed and brent the citie, and honged the kyng thereof in a iebat. Than Iosue bilded an auter to God in the hyll of He ball: & offered theron brent sacrifices, and peacible sacrifices, & wrot the Deutronomie of Moses lawe on stonis. And fyrst he blessid the puple of Israel. And after thes things: he reade the wordes of blissynge and curssing and all thyngs y• weren written in the boke of the lawe. He lefte nothinge vn touched of these thyngs whych Moses had cōmaunded: but he declarede all thynges before all the multytude of Israel, to women and to lyttle chyldren and to com

to bryng wodde & water to the seruice of the auter & of al the multitud of Israel for euer.
               Also Iosue by gods helpe, ouercam v. greate Kingis in oo daye, & made hys Princis treade on the neckis of these Kingis. And thā he hōgid these Kingis on v. Iebatis.

And he reigned in Ierusalē. xxxiii. yere on al Israell and Iuda, and was xxx. yere elde, when he biganne to reygne, and reined xl yere. After this the noble king Dauid had tweye victoryes of philisteis. Than Dauid toke xxx thousaunde mē chosen of Israel: to bring to his place the arke of God. For reuerence and deuocion: Dauid made greate minstrelsie, & mekid hymsilfe bifore y• Arke, & suffred rebuking of Michole y• daughter of Saul therfor. Dauid thought to build ā house

to y• arke of god. Thā God telde to Dauid y• his son shuld bild his hous & the trōe of Dauid. shalbe stable wt outē ende, and this is filed in Christ. Than Dauid had victorie of many lōdes & made tho tributari to Israel And god kept Dauid in al things to which he yedeforth. And Dauid did dome & rightfulnes to al his puple. And he did merci & curteci to Miphi boseth son of Ionathas. After these things Dauid dwelid at home whā Ioab & the ost wēt to batteil, & dyd aduoutri wt Bersabe ye wife of Uri: & procured y• deth of Urie by treasō.

Afterward Absalō defoulid openli, hys fathers wyfes, before al Israel.

Thā for this peril Dauid left hys mourning, & sat opē

                  THe. iii. boke of kyngs tellith fyrst howe Adonias sōne of Dauid wolde haue reignid and Dauid in his life ordeined Solomō to be king, & he reygned bifore ye death of Dauid. Than Adonias fled for dred to ye tabirnacle of god, & held ye corner of ye auter tyl Solomō sayd y• if he wer a good mā: he shuld not die. Else, if iuil were foūdē in him: he shuld die. Thā Dauid in ye time of hys dyinge charged Solomō to kepe well Gods law: &

to quite to the sonnes of Bersellaye the truth and kyndnes of her father and to punishe Ioab for his trecherous manquellyng of Abner, and of Amasa in the tyme of peace. And to punish wisely Semei, for his worst curssing which he did to Dauid, After these things Solomō made Adonias to be slayne: for he purposed gilefuly to be Kyng. And Solomon casted: awai Abiathar, that he was not the preist of the Lorde and exiled him also. For he assentid to Adonias and was traytor to the Kynge. And Solomon commaūded Ioab to be flayne in the tabernacle at the auter: for he had slayne gylefully two princis in peace, wythouten wittynge of Dauid. And the King ordeinid Sadoch priest: for Abiathar. Than the Kinge commaunded Semei that he should not go out of Ierusalē. And if he passed the strond of Cedron: he should be deade. And Semei acceptid

this. And for he passid these boū
                  dis: the Kinge commaundyd him to be slaine. And so he was slaine by cō
                  maūdement of the Kyng. After thes thyngis: the reume was confirmed in to the hondis of Solomon, & he weddyde the daughter of Pharao King of Egipt. Thā God bad Solomon axe of him what him liked.
               And he axid that God shuld yeue to him wise herte, yt he might deme hys puple and make discrecion either departynge bytwix good & euyl. And thys axynge pleased God ful mych Therefore God yafe to hym a wyse herte and vnderstondyng, in so mych that none before him was like hym, neyther shall ryse after hyme. Also God yafe to him richesse and Glorie that none amonge kyngis was lyke hym in all dayes byfore. Than, for Solomon yafe a wyse sentence of dome bitwix tweie cōmon womē, y• passide the wit of cōmon men: theye

dredden the Kyng and seiden, Gods wisdā was in him to make dome. Than is tolde the worshipful household and meinie of Solomon.
               After these thynges Solomon byldyde a noble house to himsilfe: and a famous temple to God in Ierusalē And after that the temple was fully made: al the elder mē and pryncis of linagis and Dukis, and of meinies of the chyldren of Israell, weren gatherid to Kynge▪ Solomon in Ierusalem: to brynge the arke of God fro Siō in to hys owne place in ye temple. Than the Kyng axed of God many prayeris, and profetis for hē that preiden deuoutly in the temple, and God graunted tho. After these thyngis, God halowed the temple and certified to Solomon: that if he kepte all hys cōmaundementes: he shoulde set the trone of Solomons rewme on Israel wythouten ende. And if the puple of Israel and here

chyldren kepte not Goddis heestes, but worshipen alien goddis: he shall do away Israel fro the fat of y• lond whych he yafe to hem, and God shal caste awaye fro hys syght ye temple which he halowed to his name, and Israel shal be into a prouerb, either fable either tale to al puples, & this house shall be into ensample. After this, the Quene of Saba came to Solomon: and had greate araye of mē and iewelse, and yafe many iewelse to Solomon, & he ayene to hir. Also Solomō taught hyr al things that she had in hir herte, & she blessed God & Solomon and his seruaūtis and yed in to her lond. Than Solomon made manye sheldis & bucleris of golde, and made a greate trone of Iueriand clothed it with fine golde. Than kynge Solomō was mangnified ouer all kyngis of the earth: in ryches and wisdome. And al ye earth desyred to see hys face and to heare

his wisdom, which his God had yeuen in his hert. After al these things Solomon whan he was elde louid gretli mani hethē womē & had a. M wiues principales & secōdaris. And thā his herte was be shrewed & peruertid bi tho women, y• he suid alien Gods and worshipid hē. Therfore, God reised ā aduersari to Solomō in his lyfe, & departed his rewme in y• time of Roboā his son, & yafe. x. linagis to Ieroboā his seruāt, & kept oo linage to his son for the merite of Dauid his father. And thys departing bifelmich for y• Roboā forsoke y• coūcel of olde & wise mē, & surd the coūcel of yong mē, & spake hard wor des to y• puple. Thā Roboā gathered proudli al y• house of Iuda & the linage of Beniamin, an hūdrid thousand & foure score thousand of chosē men & warioures: that thei shulden fight ayens the house of Israel, and bringe ayene the rewme to Roboā,

sonne of Solomō. But God for bad this war to Roboam & al his puple for whey, thys worde of departyng of y rewme was don of God. Thā Ieroboam made two goldē calues and bade Israel worshyp tho, & stie no more to Ierusalem and seide. Israel,

And he made temples in hygh places. Also whā Ieroboā stode on y• auter & casted incēs a mā of God came frō Iuda by the word of God, & seide. A son (Iosias by name) shal be borne to y• house of Dauid, and he shall

                  Than Ieroboam helde forth hys hond, & bade take that prophet: and hys hond was drie, & he myght not drawe it ayen. And by prayer of the prophet the honde was healed: and the token befelle on the auter as the prophet seid. And for yt the prophet eat bread in that place ayens godis byddynge, yea bi dysceyte of a false prophet: y• tru prophet of God was flayne of a lyon by the weye homeward. After these wordis Ieroboā turned not ayene fro his worst wei: but ayeneward, of the last (or vilest) puple he made priestis of hygh placis. Who euer wolde fyl hys hond, was made pryeste of hyghe placis. And for this cause ye house of Ieroboam synned and was distried and done awaye

to hir y• hir sike sōne shuld die, in hir entring into hyr house, & that ye house of Ieroboā shuld be destried vtterlie, for hys syns. And Israel shall be dreuē out of his lond for the syns of Ieroboam, y• sinned & made Israell to do sinne. Also the puple of Iuda did Idolatri. Therfore the Kyng of Egipt toke awai ye treasurs of gods house and of the

                  ingis house, and the goldē shieldis of Solomon, for which Roboā made sheldis of bras & batayle was bytwyx Roboā and Ieroboam in all daies. Than Abia reigned. iii. yere in Iuda, & yede in al the synnes of hys father. After hym roose Kyng Asa in Iuda, and he did ryghtfulnes bifore God, and dyd aweye Idolatrie, & Sodomitis fro the londe. And his hert was perfect wt god in al dais. And shortli, amōg all the kinges of Israell, was none feythful to God. Some werē good amōg the kinges of Iuda. And this

fygurith that a monge men of holye churche ben some good: out amōge heretikis, is none good vtterlye, as Ierōe seith. After many euel kingis of Israel, rose Achab the worst of al bifore him. And he weddid Iesa bell an heathen woman, the doughter of Mechaal, king of Sidonies, and Achab did manifold Idolatri. Than rose Helye the prophet, and seyde to Achab, that in. iii. yere and an halfe: neither rayne neither dewe shal be. After thys the prophete Helie hyde hymsilfe, in the stronde of Carith ayens Iordan: and dranke water and was fedde of rauens there, whyche broughten to hym breade & flech, in the euētyde & morowtide. And after that the stronde was dryed vp: God bade Helie go in to Sarepta of Sidonies, & there he was fed of a wydew, & ye pot of mele & ye pot of oyle failed not to y• wide we, til God yafe rain on ye erth. Thā Heli reised to life

the dead childe of a wōmā: at whōe he was myche susteyned. And after many dais God bade Heli shew him to Acab y• God shuld yeue rayne on the lond. And Helie dyd so, & greate hunger was in Samari. Than Helie appearid fyrst to Abdie that drede God: and fede an hūdred Prophets of God, whan Iesa bell kyllyd the Prophets of God. And Heli swore to Abdie by the lorde of oostes: that he wold appeare in yt daie to Achab Than Achab axid Heli. where thou arte he that dyftur blist Israel? And Helie seide. Not I disturble Israell: but thou and the house of thi father that han forsaken goddis heestis, & han sued Baalā: han disturblede Israell. After thys, the prophet Helie conuictyd by an open miracle eyght hundred and fyftie prophets of Bal of open Idolatrie: and killid hem al wyth helpe of the puple that bileuid to God, for the greate miracle.

And after this God sēt great taine, & Helie ran befor Achab to ye citti of Israel. After thes things Helie fled for drede of Iesabell: y• manacide to

                  lee him. And whā he had fled into de serte by y• iurney of a daie: he axed of God to die. And whā he slept: an An gel bade him rise & eate bread, bakē vnder ashis & drink water, & he yede in ye strēgth of y• meat. xl. daies &. xl. nightis: tilto Oreb the hyll of God. And whā he was hid ther in a dē, & seid yt he was left alone a prophet of the lord, & thei soughten to slee hym: God bad hym go to Damaske & anoynt Asael kyng on Sirie, & anoint Hieu king on Israel, & anointe Elise prophet for him. And these thre shuldē do vēgeāce on trespassours: & flee hem. And god left to himsilfe. vii. M of men of Israel: whose knees werē not bowed bifor Baal. Thā it suith how Elise suid Heli. After thes thin gis, king Achab had. ii. greate meruelous victoris ayēs Benadab king

And whā Achab yede downe to take possessiō of this viner, god bad Heli mete him, & seie thus. Thou hast slaine & hast ta kēpossessiō. The lord seith thes thingis.

Also doggis shulē eate Iesabel in the field of Israel. If Achab dye in the Citie: doggis shulen eate hym. If he die in the fielde byrdis of the eyre shulē eate him.

Therfore God brought not in this euyle in hys dayes: but in the daies of his sonne. In the thyrde yere after these thynges: about iiii. C.

After this the prophet Helie should be rauishid awey fro erth, and Elise knew this, & sued him in eche place, tilto the rauishing. And Helie smote wyth his mātell the waters of Iordan: and tho werē departed therby: and Helie and Elise yeden ouir bi y• drye bottome therof.

After these thyngis, Ioram the Kynge of Israel, and Iosaphat the Kynge of Iuda, & also the thredde Kynge that was Kynge of Edome: weren in deserte & hadden no water, and weren in poynte of peryshinge.

We moune fynd these. vi. kyndis in euill prelatis (for why) simulacris of cley bene fleshly prelates, of whiche God seyth in the Psalter, I shal do hem awaye, as the cley of the stretis. Simulacris of tree bene vnwise prelatis and boistuous & with oute wyt. Of whiche it is sayd in holy scripture, a tree is wlappid in syluer. And these bene seyde to be mad and nought: into prelatis. These ben beastis clepid chymeris: that han aparte of eche beaste. And suche bene

not, no but only in opinionne either speche, & not in dede nether in kynde. Simulacris of Brasse ben they that han only wordly eloquēce. For why brasse yeueth greate sowne. In Epistle to Corthinthies. xiii. Chapt. If I speake in ye langagis of mē, & of Aungellis, and I haue not Charitie: I am made as bras sowneing. Simulacris of stone bene they, y• bene broken fro rightfulnes and vertue for temporall strength. These prelatis be not the stone whiche is set into the heade of the corner, but these ben the stone of hurtyng and of sclander. Simulacris of Syluer bene they y• bene made by money, either riches whiche prelates seyne. What wolen ye yeue to vs? and we shulen bitraye Chryste to you. Golden simulacris bene tho that bene made onlye for worldly nobly. For why golde signifieth nobley. And therfore y• heade of the Image of Nabugodonosore

Than Mardochee and the Iewis dydden greate Penaunce and n aden greate Sorowe: and prayden Godde of helpe in that greate nede. And Mardochee sent to Hester: that she shulde do the same, and go to the Kynge in peryle of her lyfe, and to axe grace of hym and reuokynge

And After mich fasting, penaūce and pryer: Hester betoke hyr selfe to Goddis dysposytyon, and to perylle of here death, and entryd to the Kyng, yea ayens the lawe of the lond, whan she was not clepyd: to axe mercye and helpe of the Kynge for her selfe and all her puple. And Godde turned the fiersenes and the cruelty of the King to mekenes, mercie, and benygnitie: ayens Hester and ye puple of Iews. And than he reuokyd ye powr graū

               But al this is false, as Iob priueth and Godde confyrmyth in the ende. For why, reward of Good dedis is mych more in the lyfe comynge, thā in present lyfe. And a vertuouse man is punnyshed here, for to haue mede in heauen. And cōmonlye a iuste man hathe more trybulacion in this lyfe: than a wycked man. As it is open of Chryst yt suffrid here much dysease: & of tiraūtis, y• han mich prosperitte in this lyfe, And therfore, Iob telde hys good dedes opēly, to cōfort him selfe ayens dyspeyre: to whyche hys

And of these two poyntys, Iob repentyde in the ende. Than Godde foryafe to hym thys lyttle syne, and appreuyde hys true sentēce: and damnid the errour of his aduersaries. Than Iob preied and made sacrifice for his aduersaries: and God hearde hym and did mercie to hem. And Godde addyde all thyngys duble that Iob hadde.

And he killid a man that did Idolatri on the auter: & dystried the auter wheron Idolatrie was done.

And mani men that soughtē dome & ryghtfulnes: and woldē kepe Gods Lawe: camen to hem into deserte.

And he thankyde God and the hygheste priste: and yede to the King and tolde hym howe it stode. And he wytnessid to al men the greate werkis of God: whych he had sene with hys iyen.

Than Eleazarus cheese to dye a sharpe Death: rather that he woulde breke Goddys lawe in a litle pointe to eatte porke, yea to feyne to eate porke.

                  But it is to wytte, that holy scripture hath. iiii. vnderstōdyngis. Literal, Moral Aligorike, & Anagogike. The Literal vnderstōdyng teachith the thynge done in dede. And litteral vnderstandynge is ground and foū
                  dement of. iii. gostli vnderstondingis In so mych as Austē in hys Epistle to Uincent & other doctours seyne. Only by the lytteral vnderstondyng a mā maie argu ayens an aduersari.
               
                  Aligorike is a gostli vndirstōding that teachyth what thyng men owē to beleue of Chryste eyther of holye Churche. Morall, is a gostly vnderstandyng that teachyth menne what vertues they owen to sue, and what vyces they owne to flee. Anagogik, is a gostly vnderstandynge that teacheth men what blisse they shullenne haue in heauen. And thes. iiii. vnderstondingys moune be taken in thys worde Ierusalē. For why, to y• literall vnderstondynge it sygnifieth an earthly cytie, as London or such an other. To Alygorye it syngnyfyeth holy churche in earth y• fytyth ayens sennis and Fendis. To morall vnderstonding, it singnifyeth a Christē sowlle. To anagogike it sygnifyeth holy church reynyng in blysse, eyther in heauen, and tho that benne therin.
               And these three Gostlye vnderstondyngis ben not autentike, either of beleue: no but tho ben growndyd

openly in the text of holy Scripture in oo place ether in other, either in open reason that may not be distryid▪
               
               Either whan the Gospelars either other Apostles: take Allegorie of the olde Testamēt and confirmen it. As Poul in ye Epistil to Galathies the. iiii. chapiter, preuyth, that Sarai the fre wyfe and principall of Abraham, wyth Isaac hyr sonne: signifieth by Alegorie, the newe Testament, and the sonnis of byhest. And Agar the handmayde with hyr sonne Ismael: signifieth by Alegory the olde Testament, and fleshly men that shulen not be receyuyd into the heritage of God, wyth the sonnis of byheste, that holden the trewth and fredome of Christis Gospeil wyth endelesse Charitie.
               Also holy Scripture hath manye figuratife speachis.
               And as Austin seyeth in the thryd boke of christen teachyng: that Autours

of holy Scriture vsen moe figuris, that is moe figuratyfe speachis, than gramariens moune gesse that readen not tho figurys in holye Scripture.
               It is to be ware in the begynyng: that we take not to the Letter a figuratyfe speach.
               For than (as Poule seythe) the Letter sleayth: but the Spirite, that is Gostly vnderstondyng, quyckennythe.
               For whanne a thynge whyche is seyed figuratyfely, is taken so as if it be seyed propirly: me vnderstondyth fleshly.
               And none is clepyd more couenable the Death of Soull: than whan vnderstonding that passith Beastis, is made sogette to the fleshe in suyng the Letter.
               Whateuer thyng in Gods worde may not be referrid propirli to honestie and vertuis, neither to the truth

of feyth: it is figuratife speach. Honesti of vertuis perteinith to the loue of God and our neyghbours. Truth of feyth perteynith to knowe God and thy neighboure. Holy scripture cōmaūdith nothyng but charitie: it blamith nothyng no but couetise. And in that maner it enformith the good vertus either ye good conditiōs of men. Holy scripture affirmith nothing: no but christē feith, by thyngis passid, present, and to cō
                  myng. All these thyngis perteinen to nourish charitie and make it strong, and to ouircome & quench couetise. Also it is figuratife speache: where the wordis maken Allegorie, either a dearke lykenes either a Parable. And it is figuratife speach in ye first chapter of Ieremie. To daie I haue ordeinid the on folckis and rewmis: that thou drawe vp by the rote and dystry and bylde and plante. That is, that thou drawe out olde synnis,

and dystry circomstaūcis either causis of tho: and bylde vertuis & plant good werckis and customis.
               Al thyngis in holy scripture that semē to vnwise mē to be ful of wykidnes ayens a mā himsilfe ether ayens his neyghboure: ben figuratife spechis, and the priuities eyther gostly vnderstondyngis shulden be sought oute of vs, to the fedyng eyther kepyng of Charitie.
               Such a rule shal he kepte in figuratife spechis, that so loug it be turnid

                  n mynde by diligent consyderation: tyl the expownyng either the vnderstondyng be brought to the rewme of Charitie.
               And if any speach of scriptur sowne propitly Charitie: it o with not to be gessid a figuratife spech. And if it for byd wickidnes either cōmaūde profite either good doyng: it is no figuratife speach. If it seme to cōmaūde crueltie either wyckidnes, eyther to

for byd profyte eyther good doinge: it is a fyguratife spech. Christe seith If ye eatten not the fleshe of manis sonne, & drynken not hys bloud: you shoullen not haue lyfe in you. Thys speache semyth to cōmaūde wyckidnes eyther crueltye: therfore it is a fyguratyfe speache, and cōmaundith men to cōmune wyth Christis passi on, and to kepe in mynde swetly and profinablie, that Christis flech was woundid and crucifiede for vs. Also whan holy scryptur seyth. If thyne enimie hunger, fede thou hym, if he thryste: geue thou drynke to hym: it cōmaundyth benefyte eyther good doynge. Whan it seyth, thou shalte gather togyther coles on his heade: it semith that wickednes of euyl wil is cōmaundyd. Thys is seyd by fyguratyfe speach: yt thou vnderstoud that the coolis of fyre, ben brenyng weilyngis either mourningis of pē
                  naunce: by whych the pryde of hym

is made whole, whyche soroweith that he was enimie of that man, that helpith and releuith his wrechednes
               Also the same worde, either the same thynge in Scripture: is taken some tyme in good and some tyme in Euyll. As a Lion signifiyth some tyme Christe: and in an other place it signifith ye deuil. Also sowr dough is set some time in euil: wher Christ seith, beware of the sowre dough of the Phariseis, which is Hypocrisie.
               Sowre dough is set also in good: whan Christe seyth, the rewme of heauens is lyke sowre dough &c.
               And whan not oo thyng alone but tweyne eyther moe ben felyd eyther vnderstōden by the same wordis of scripture, though it be hyd y• he vnderstode that wrote: it is no peryle if it maye be preuid by other placis of holy scripture, that ech of tho things accordith wyth truth, and in hap the autour of scripture seith the ilke sentence

in the same wordis, which we wolen vnderstonde. And certis the Spirite of God that wrought these thyngis by the Autour of scripture: byfore seeth wythouten doubt that the ilke sentence shulde come to the readar either to the hearar.
               Yea the Holygoste purueied that that ilke sentēce (for it is groūdid on truth) shuld come to the redadar, either hearar. For what myghte be purueyed of God largelyer and plē
                  tuouselyer in Gods spechis: thā that the same wordis be vnderstōden in many maners: which maners other wordis of God that ben not of lesse autoritie, make to be preuid?
               Austine in the. iii. boke of christen teachyng, seyth all thys and myche more in the bygynyng therof.
               Also he, whose herte is full of charitie: comprehendith wythouten any erroure, the manifold aboundaūce, & largist teching of Gods scripture.

For why, Paul seith. The fulnes of law is chariti. And in an other place The ende of law (that is perfection eyther, fyllynge of the lawe) is charitie of clene herte and of good cōscience and of feyth not feynyde. And Iesu Chryst seyth. Thou shalte loue thy lorde God of al thyne herte, and of al thy soule and of al thy mynde: and thy neighbour as thy selfe. For in thes two cōmaūdemētis, hangith all the lawe and the prophetis. And as the rote of all euillis is couetyse: so the rote of al goodnes is charitie.
               Charitie by which we louen God and the neghbour: holdyth sykerlye al the greatnes & largenes of Gods speachis. Therfore, if it is not leisure to seke al holi scripturs, to expowne al the wlappings of words, to perse all the priuities of scrypturis: holde thou charite wher al thyngis hang, so thou shalte holde that, that thou lernidest there. Also thou shalt holde

that, that thou lernydiste not. For if thou knowe charitie: thou knoweste somthynge wheron also that hangyth, that in hap thou knowiste not.
               And in that that thou vnderstōdist in scriptur: charitie is open, and in that that thou vnderstondysie not, charitie is hyd. Therfor, he yt holdith charitie in vertuys either in good condicions: holdyth boeth that, that is open and that, that is hid in Goddis wordis. Austyne seyth al thys and mich more in a sermō of the preising of charitie. Also. vii. rue

               The firstrule is of Iesu Christe and of his holi spirite. Do persone of the head & of the bodie, that is of Christ and of holy chyrche: is shewid to vs in this rule. For it is not seid in vain to feythful men, ye bene the seede of Abraham: whan there is

                  a myter accordith to Christ which is ye spouse: & an ornamēt acordith to holi chirch, which is the spouses of Chryst.
               The. ii, rule, as Ticonie seith, is of the bodi of Christ: which bodi is departyd into tweyne.
               But certis th

                  che shal not be wt him wtoutē end. But it shal be seid of the veri body & of the medlid bodi of Christ, ether of ye veri bodi & of the feinid bodi of Christ.

For why, hypocritis shoullen be seid to be not wyth Chryste, not onelye withoutē end: but also now, though they semen to bee in the Churche of Chryst. Wherefore, this rule might be clepyd thus: that it were seyde of the medlid chyrch that is that cōprehendyth chosen mē to blisse, and also Hipocritis that shoulen be damnid. And this rule axeth a waking ether dylygente reader. Whan it speakyth of other men, it semith to speak nowe as to the same men whych it speake before. Either it semyth to speake of the same men: whane it speakyth of other men, as if oo body be of euereither, for temporall medlynge, and communynge of Sacramentys.
               To thys rule it perteyneth that the chirch seyth in songis of Songys: I am blacke and fayre, as the tabernacles of Cedar, as the skynnys of Solomon. The Churche seyde that she is euereither for temporal vnitie

wythin oo nette of good fyshys, and of euyll fyshes. For whye, the tabernacles of Cedar, perteinē to Ismaell, that shall not be Heyre wyth the sonne of the free wyfe, The thyrde rule is of byheestis and lawe.
               Thys rule maye be sayd also of the spirite and letter: and maye be sayde also of grace, and of commaundemente. And Ticonie errid in seying, that wercks ben yeuen to vs of God for merite of feyth: but feyth it selfe is so of vs, that it is not of God to vs. The fourth ruele is of all and of partye. Whan some of a thing is set for all, eyther ayenwarde, all is sette for a partie. The. v. rule is of tymes. And thys is by a fygure clepyd Sinodoches, whan the parte is set for all, eyther al is set for a parte. One Euangelyste seyth that it was done after. viii. dayes: whannethe face of Christe shynyde as the sunne. And an other gospeller seith, that it was

And yt he that seyde, aftir vi. dais, reckenyd all the whole daies & the midle days & none other, By thys kynde of spech by whyche kynd al is singnified bi a part: the ilk question of Christis rysynge ayene is assoyled. The last parte of the day wyth ye nyght passed before, and the fyrste parte of the sundaye in whose morowe tyde he rose ayene: is taken for al sundaye and the nyght before goynge. And the Sabot wyth the whole nyght byfore goynge is al an whole daie and night. If these daies and nyghtys were not taken thus:

there moute not be. iii. dayes and thre nyghtis, in which he byforseyde that he shoulde be in the herte of the earth. Also this rule of tymes is taken for lawful numbres as ben. vii. x. xii. and such mo.
               For ofte suche noumbris ben set for all tyme, as thys that Dauid seyth. Seuensytis in the daye, I seyd preisynge eyther he riyng to the, is none other thyng than thus Hys heriyng be euer in my mouth. Also by an. C. &. xliii. in Apocal: is signified the vniuersitie ether al the multitud of seintis. The vi. rule is of recapitulatiō, either rehersing a thing done bifore: not in order as it is set, for whi some things bē seid so, as if tho

As in genesis, it is seyde. God plantid paradise in Eden at the east, and settyd there the man that he formyd. And Godde brought forth yet of the earth ech fayre tree &c. This is seyd by recapitulation. In lyke manner, ther the londe was of oo lyppe, that is speache: it is seid

Also they that han lykynge to studie in holye wrytte: shulen be chargyde that they kunne the kyndys and maners of speakyngs in holy scripturis and that they perceyuen dylygentlye and holdenne well in mynde, howe a thyng is wont to be seid in holi scrip ture. Also, that is souerayne helpe

               For they readen in tho scripturis, about which they bē studiouse: that God yeuith wisedome and cunning & vnderstōding of his face, that is yift and grace. Also if here study be done wyth mekenes & loue of christē lore, it is of God.

And they oughtē not to speake in other maner thā thei dydē. And y• Pro phetis (& most Amos) werē full eloquēt. And Paul was full eloquēt in his Epistlis.

Whych truth is the Philosophers foundē not, but dyggiden oute of the metalis of Gods purueyaunce, whych is shed euerie where. So dyd Ciprian the swetest Doctoure and most blessed martyr.

               And by thys affection either good wyll, he gettith by bysy preyars the conforte of Godis helpe, that he be not broken by dispeyre. He bigynith to be in the fourth degree of gostely strength: in whych he hungrith and thyrstith ryghtfulnes.

And in thys degre wherin a man dyeth to ye world he neyther preferrith nether makyth euen hym selfe neyther hys neiboure wyth the truth of holy write.

And in the chife vniuersitye of oure rewme (as mani true men tellen wyth gret wey lyng) thys horrible and deuilys cursydnes is purposid, of Christis enymies and traytourys of all chrysten puple: that no man shall learne diuinitie neyther holy wryte, no but he that hath done hys fourme in arte, that is, that hath cōmencyd in arte, and hath be regente twoe yere after. This woulde be. ix yere or. x. before that he learne holye write, after that he can commenlye well hys gramer: though he haue a good wytte and traueile ful sore and haue good findyng. ix vere eyther. x. after hys gram mer. Thys semith vtterli the Diuils purpose: that fewe men eyther none shulen learne and kun Goddis law.

But God seyth by Amos on three greate trespasses of Damaske: and on the fourth I shal not cōuert him. Where Ierom seyth, the fyrst synne is to thynke euylis, the. ii. synne is to consent to wey ward thoughtis, the thyrde synne is to fyll in werke, the fourth synne is to do not penaunce after the sinne, and to please him silfe in hys sinne. But Damaske is interpretyde Drynkynge either byrlyng bloude.
               Lorde, where Oxenforde drinkyth bloude and byrlith bloude, by sleaynge of quicke men and doynge of Sodomies, in leasiug a parte of mans blude wherby a chyld might be formid: deme thei that knowen. And where Oxenford drynk bloud of synne, and styrre other men of the lond to do syn by boldnes of clarkis deme they iustly that seene it at eigh and knowen by experience. Loke nowe, where Oxenford, is in

thre orryble synnis, and in the forth, on whyche God restythe not tyll he punyshe it.
               Somtyme, chyldren and younge men Artitars werenne deuoute and clene as Angeles in comparyson of other: nowe men seine they ben full of pryde and lecherye, and dyspytuouse othys nedelesse and false, and dyspyseynge of Goddys hestys. Somtyme Ciuili
                     •…
                  ns & Canonistis, weren deuoute, and so bysy in here learnynge, that they token full lyttle reste on bedde: nowe men seyne, that they bene ful of pride, and nice araie, enuye and couetise, wyth lecherye, glottonnye and Idelnes. Sometyme Dyuynis werenne full holye and deuoute, and dyspisyden vtterlye the worlde and lyuyden as angellis, in mekenes, cleenesse, soueraynue chastytye, and charytye, and taughtē truly Godds lawe in werk and word: now men seine they bene

as delycate of her mouth & wombe and as couetyse as other worlddlye men, and flatteren & maken leasings in preachynge, to eschewe bodylye persecution, and to gette benefycys.
               The fyrste greate synne is generalli in the vniuersitie (as men dre den and seene at eigh) the second orible synne is sodomys, and stronge meyntenaūce therof, as it is knowē to many persōs, of the rewme. And at the last parliamēte, alas diuinis, that shulden passe other men in clea nes & holines (as an gellis of heauen, passen frele mē in vertuis) bene moste slaundred of this curssed sinne ayens kynde.
               
                  The thryde horible synne is Simonie and for sweryng in the semble house, yt shulde be an house of rightfulnes & holynes, where euillis shullen be redressyd.
               This Simonie wyth purtenaū
                  cis therof, is mych worse and more abominable than bodily sodomies.
               Yet on these three abominations God wolde graciousely cōuert clerkis: if they wollen do very penaunce and yeue hem wholy to vertuis.
               But on the fourthe abomination, purposid no we to letten christē men, yea priestis and curats, to learne fre ly Gods lawe, tyll they han spendyd ix. yere or. x. atarte, that comprehē
                  dyth many strong errouris of Heathen men ayens christen byleue: it semyth well that God wole not cease of vengeaūce, til it and other ben punishid sore. For it semith that worldly clerkis and feynid religiouse done thys: that simple men of wytte and

fyndyng knowe not Godis lawe, to preache it generally ayens synnis in the rewme.
               But witte ye worldly clerkis and feinid relygiouse: that God both can and maye (if it lykyth hym) spede simple men oute of the Uniuersitie, as mych to kunne holye wrytte: as maisters in the Uniuersitie.
               And therfore no greate charge thoughe neuer man of good wyll, be poysonyde wyth Heathen mens errouys nyne yere eyther tenne, but euer lyue well and studye holy wryte by elde Doctouris and Newe: and preach truely and freely ayens open synnys to hys death.
               See therfore what Ierome seyth on Amos.
               God byfore seeth Euilys to commynge: that men heare and amende hemsilf, and be delyueryd fro peryle nyghynge.
               Eyther if that they dyspisen: they

ben punished iustlyer. And God that before seeth peynes: wole not punish men that synnen, but that they be amendid. Ierome seyth this in ye ende of the fyrste boke of Amos. God for his greate mercie graūt that clerkis heare the greate vengeaunce manassyd of God, and amende hemsylfe truely, that God punishe not hem.
               For if they amende not hemsilfe, they ben Heritykis, made harde in here synnis. But se what Ierome seyth ayens Heretikis: and in commēding of holy scripture. He seythe thus on Amos.
               Heretikis that seruen the wombe and Glotonie, bene clepid righfully fattest kyne, or kyne ful of shenshipe. We owen to take holy scripture on three maners.
               Fyrste we owen vndurstonde it by the letter: and to all thyngis that ben commaunded to vs therin.
               The. ii. tyme by Allegorye, that is

gostlye vnderstonding.
               And in the thryde tyme, by blysse of thyngis to comynge.
               Ierome seyth thus in the seconde boke on Amos, & in the. iiii. Chapter of Amos. Nethelesse for Lire came late to me: se what he seyth on the vndurstonding of holy scripture. He 
                     •…
                  oriteth thus in the. ii. prolog on the Byble. Iohn seyth in the fyfth Chapter of Apocalips.
               I sygh a boke writtē wythin and wythout forth, in the honde of the sytter on the trone. This boke is holy Scripture which is seyde written wythout forth, as to the literall vnderstondynge, and within, as to the priuie and gostly vnderstondynge.
               And in the fyrste prologe, he declaryth foure vnderstondyngis of holy write in this manner.
               Holye wryte, hathe this specyaltye that vnder oo letter, it conteyneth manye vnderstandyngis.

For the principall autour of holy write, is God him selfe. In whose powre it is not only to vse wordes to signifie a thynge as men done: but also he vsith thyngis signified by wordis to signifie other thyngis.
               Therfore by the signifiyng by wordis, is taken the litterall vnderstondynge either historiall of holy scripture: and by the signifiynge which is made by thyngis, is takē the priuie either goftly vndurstondyng which is. iii. maneris. Allegorike, morall either Tropologike, and Anogogike. If thyngis signified by wordis ben referrid to signifie tho thyngis that owen to be bileuid in the newe testamente: so it is taken the sense of Alegorike. If thyngis ben referrid to signifie tho thyngis which we owen to do: so it is moral sense either Tropologike. If thyngis ben referred to signifie tho thingis yt shulē be hopid in blisse to comynge: so it is Anagogike

sense. The letter teachith what is done, Allegorye teachith what thou owiste to bileue, Morall teachith what thou oweste to do. Anagogie teachithe whyther thou owist to go. And of these. iiii. sensis either vndurstondingis: maye be set ensam ple in this worde Ierusalem. For by the litterall vnderstondynge, Ierusalem signifieth a Citie, yt was sometyme the chiefe Citie of the rewme of Iude. And Ierusalem was foundid fyrste of Melchisedech, and aftirward it was alargid & made strong by Solomon. By morall sence, it sig nifieth a faithfull soule. By whiche sense it is seyd in the. lii. Chapter of Esaie. Rise thou, rise thou, sitte thou Ierusalem. By sense Allegorike, it signifiethe the chirche fyghtynge ayens synnis and fendis, by whiche sense it is seyde in the▪ one & twentye of the Apocalips.
               I. sygh the holy Citie newe Ierusalem

comynge downe from heauē, as a spouse ourned to hir housbōde. By sense Anagogik it signifieth ye chirch reignynge in blysse. By this sense it is seyde in the. iiii. Chapter to Galathies. Thilke Ierusalem whiche is aboue, which is oure mother: is fre. And as ensample is set in oo worde, so it myght be set in oo reasone. And as in one, so and in other. Lire seyth al this in ye fyrst prologe on the bible. (:)
            
            
               The. xiiii. Chapter.

                     •…
                  o a gostly exposition that discordith fro ye litteral sēse, owith to be erectid vnsēli & vncouenable, ether les semely & lesse couenable. And therfore it is nedeful for hem yt wolē profite in ye studye of holy scriptur, to bigyne at the vndurstondynge of litteral sence. Most sithē by the litteral sense alone, (& not by gostly sense) maye be made an argumēt, either priefe, to priuyng either declaring of a doubt, as Austē seith in his Epistle to Uincēt Donatiste. S. Isidre in ye first boke of So ueraine good. xx. Chap. settith. vii. rulis to expoūd holy scripture. And some clepē these rulis, ye keis of scrip tur, for by these rulis y• vnderstōding of scriptur is opēed in many thingis.
               
                  The fyrst rule is of our Lorde Iesu Chryste, and of his gostly bodye, whiche is holy chirche. For why, for knyttynge togidir of the heade to the bodie: holy scripture speakith sometyme of euereither vnder oo reasone, as vnder oo persone, and passith fro one to an other. In ensample, in. lxi. Chapter of Esaie it is seyde. He clothide me wyth clothis of health, and he cumpassid me wyth clothingis of ryghtfulnes, as a spoule made fayre wyth a corowne, as a spousesse ourned with hir brochis. For why, this that is seyde as of spouse, is vnderstonden of Christe. And this yt suith, as spousesse: is vnderstonden of holy chirche. Also in the fyrst Chapter of Songis, it is seyde. Kysse he me wt the coss
                     •…
                   of his mouthe: for thy tetis ben better than wyne. For when it is seyde, Kysse heme. &c. It is the worde of the spousesse desyringe to haue the spouse. And this that suith,

for thy tetis. &c. is y• word of y• spouse preysyng the spouses. Wherfore in such things knite so togidir bi resone byfore seyde: a prudente readar oweth to perceyue, what accordith to the heade, & what to the dodye. The▪ ii rule is of the verie body & of the feynid body of oure Lorde Iesu Christ. For why holy chirch which is the gostly body of Christ, is a net which is not yet drawen to y• brynk. Therfore it hath euel mē medlyd wt good men tyll to the dome, in which these shulē be departed fro hem. And therfore in holy scripture: euill men ben preised some tyme wyth good men, wyth the which they ben medeled. As in the. xi. Chapter of Osee, God seyth thus. Israell is a chylde, and I loued hym. And ayene warde sometyme good men ben blamed wt euell men, as in the fyrst Chapter of Esay. An Oxe knewe his Lorde, and an Asse knew the cratch of his Lord

but Israel knew not me & my puple vnderstode not. And sometime in the same reson it is expressyd, what pertaineth to good men: & what to euil mē. As in ye. i. chap. of songs it is seid I am blak but fair, ye doughters of Ierusalē as ye tabernacles of Cedar as ye skins of Solomō. Thes ben ye words of ye spouses which for reson of euil mē cōteinid in ye chirch seith, I am blak, but for reson of good mē: it addith, But fair. And this y• suith as for ensāple. As ye tabernacles of Ce dar: is referryd to euil mē. For why Cedar was the sōne of Ismael as it is seid in ye. xxv. of Genesis: of whōe Saracēs camē forth. And this yt is addid, as ye skyns of Solomō, is referrid to good mē. Therfore bi Solomō, here is vnderstōden God him silfe: bi christē expositours & Hebrus And therfore the skins of Solomon ben seyde tho with whych the tabernacle was hylyd. in whych tabernacle

good men worshypen God.
               The. iii. rule is of the spryte and of the Letter. Thys rule is expounyd thus cominlye: that the hystorial either Lytterall sense and the mystike eyther gostlye sence, is taken vnder the same letter. For whie the trueth of the storie shalbe holdē: and nethelesse it shal be referryd to the gostlye vnderstondyng. Thys rule maye be expounyde also in an other manner that it be referryd also to the lytteral sense, as other rulys benne. Aboute whych thynge it is to se that the same letter hath some tyme double litterall sense, in ensample in the first boke of paralipomenō the. xvii. chapiter God seyth to Solomō. Ishal be to hym into a father, and he shal be to me into a sonne. And thys to the letter is vnderstondē of Solomō: in as mich as he was y• sonne of God bi grace in youth. Therfor N

                  e. And this is opē by thys yt Paule bryngyth in to priue: that Chryste is more than Angellis. But suche pryu
                     •…
                  nge may not be made by gostli sense: as Austyne seyth ayens Uyncent Donatiste Forsoth the forsayde autorltie was fyllyd to the letter in Solo mō. Netheles perfectly: for he was the sonne of God only bi grace. But it was fyllyde perfectlyer in Chryst that was the sonne of God bi kynd.
               But nethelesse euereyther exposition is lytterall vtterlye. Nethelesse the seconde exposition, whych is of Chryst: is gostly and pryuie in some manuer, in as mych as Solomon was the fygure of Chryste.
               The. iiii. rule is of all and of parte.

For why: scrypcure passyth fro one to an other: and ay
                     •…
                  newarde. As in the. xiii. chapiter of Esaie: the scripture spekyth fyrste ayens Babylon specially, whan it is seyde. The byrt
                     •…
                  im of Babilon. And than the scripture passyth to vnderstōd the worde generallye of al the worlde: by thys that suyth. The lord comyth fro the hyghnes of heauen: and the vessellis of his strong vengeaunce camē, that he distrye all earth. Afterwarde the scryptur turnyth ayene to speake ayens Babylon speciallye: whan it is seyde. Lo, I shall reise on you Medeis: that shulen not seke syluer.
               For why Darius Medes, wyth Cirus hys cosenne, toke Babilon and kyllede Baltasar, the Kynge of Babylon, as it is seyde in the fyfte chapyter of Danyel.
               The. v. rule is of tymes: whych rule byfallyth in. iiii. maners-In oo mā
                  er, by a fygure clepid Sinodoches:

whan a parte of tyme is set for all the tyme. As it is seyde in the gospel, that Chryst laye. iii dayes in the Sepulchre, and nethelesse, the fyrste day and the thyrd weren not whole dayes. In an other maner thys rule byfallyth for smalle partis of tyme that bene noumbrede sometyme inscripture: and somtyme ben left out. And by thys the scrypture that spea kyth of some noūbre of yeres in many placys: settyth somtime moe yers recknyng the forseyde smale partis. In an other place, it settyth fewe
                     •…
                  e yeres: in leauing out ye smale parts. In the thyrde manner thys rule byfalleth, for that the recknyng of yeris begynnith in oo place at the former terme, and in an other place at the latter terme. As in the xv. chapyter of Genises, it was seyd to Abrahā. That his seed shall be a pylgrime by. iiii. hūdrid yere. And in the. xii. Chap. of Exodi, it is seyd of this pilgrimag

that the dwellinge of the sonnis of Israell in the londe of Egipt was of. iiii. hundred yere and. xxx. For the rikenyng of this more noumbre, biginyth at the tyme, in whiche it was seyde to Abraham in thee. xii. of Genesis.
               Go out of the londe. &c. And the rikening of the lesse numbre, biginith at the natiuitie of Isaac that was xxx. yere aftir the goyng out of Abraham fro Aran.
               The fourth time, this rule falith, for yt holy scripture speakith of thyng to coming, by ye maner of thing passid. As in the. ix. Chap. of Esaie. A lyttle childe was borne to vs &c. And this is to signifie the certentie of prophecie whose bifalling of time coming is so certeine, as if it were passid now. And this is for certenti of godis bifore knowing, by whych the reuelaciō is made to y• prophet. Nethlesse, such maner of spech hath no place n
                     •…
                  
                  
but in prop hecie of predestinacion eythere full determinynge of God whiche Prophecie is whan a thinge to coming in none certeine to manis knowinge is she wid to the Prophete in that maner, by which it is in y• byfore knowynge of God, whiche byfore knowynge as God biholdith, so wythouten feailynge thyngis to comynge, as thyng is presente & passid. But in Prophecie of manassynge, suche maner of speach hath no place, whiche prophecie of manas is, whā any peyue worthy to be brought in on any puple or on a persone, is shewid to the prophete. Not by that y• it is in the byfore knowinge of God, but by the order of second causis, as by the euyll deserueyngis of mē. As is that Prophecie of Ionas. iii. chap ter. Yet fourtye dayes, and Niniuie shall be distried. For why, the sinnis of that citie hadden deseruid this distriynge.

Netherlesse, for such a cause is chaū
                  gable, therfore sometyme the effecte (that is peyne manassid) sueth not, as here, for Niniuitis diddē penaūce and so the Lorde brought not in the peyne manassyd.
               The. vi. rule is of recapitulation. That is of rehersing of thyngis done byfore. And of Anticipation either byfore takynge, that is settynge in of thyng byfore it is done. For in holye scrypture, not euerye storye and dedis ben wrytten in the same order in whiche tho bene done. And therefore whan latter thyngis bene set byfore, it is seyde Anticipaciō either bifore takyng. Whā the foremer thingis bene set byhinde, it is seyde recapitulacion, either rehersyng of thing done bifore. As in the tenth Chapter of Genisis it is seyde of the Sonnis of Noe.
               The Ilis of the heathen folke in here contreys, weren departid of the

sonnes of Noe: eche man by his langage. And within the same. x Chapter it is seyde. These 
                     •…
                  en the sonnis, of Cham, in kynreddes and langagis. And afterwarde it is seyd in the xi. Chapter. The londe was of oo langage, and of the same wordis. Wherof it is open that this that is byfore seyde of ye departyng of langagis, is seyde by Anticipacion. In like maner in. ii. Chapter of Genesis After that Moses in. i. Chapter had discreuid the creation either making of nought of heauen and of earth, & the departing & ourning of y• world, he sayde, these benethe generations of heauen and of earthe, in the daie in whiche tho weren made. Wherof it is open, that this is seyde: by recapitulacion, either rehersyng of thing done bifore. The. vii. rule is of y• deuell & of his body. For as Gregorye seyth in the tenth. Homelie. Certis ye deuill is heade of al wicked mē. And

all wycked mē be membres of thys heade.
               And therfore the knettynge togither of the hede to the membres, the scrip ture that speakith of one: passith in ye same knittinge togither of reason, to speake of y• tother. As in the. xiiii. Chapter of Esaie. Wher y• scripture weake
                     •…
                  h of the king of Babilō, that was a membre of the deuil: it passith to speake of prince of fendis, whan 
                     〈◊〉
                   is seyd there. Lucifer that risidiste 
                     •…
                  ly, howe feldist thou downe fro heauen. And in the. xxviii. chapter of Ezechiel, wher the scriptur speaketh of y• prince of Tire it passith to speak of the deuil, when it is addid. Thou a signet eyther a printe of y• lykenes of God, were full of wysedome and perfecte in fayrnes, in the delicite of Paradise of God. Lire seyth al this in the seconde prologe of Genesis. Here Lire rehersyth the sentence of S. Austin & of Isidre in these rulis:

and declarith hem openly by holye Scripture and reasone, and countrith not Austin, but declarith hym full myche to simple mens wyt, and addith more by Scripture and reasōe, y• Austine touchith not. Though these rulis and keyes of Scripture bryngin men to greate vnderstāding therof: yet men motē take hede what is seyde of Chryste of his godheade, and what by hys manheade. For Chryst by his māheade, is seyd lesse than the father, and by the godhead he is sey de euē wyth the father. And for asmuch as Chryst is boeth God and man, we grauntē that God was deadly and dyed on the Crosse. Not by his godheade, but by the māhead of Chryste, that was ioyned in oneheade of persone wyth the godhead. And we graunt, as the Gospel doth that man whyle he was deadly vpon earth: was in heauē, for his godheade was ther, & he also by reasone

therof. Also we moun graunte well that a man made both heauen and earth. For Christe by his godheade, (which Christe is and was mā) dyd thus. Also holy Scriptur tellith oft the thoughtis of men and of the wor dis & dedis. And whā the thoughtis & wordis and dedis of men ben contrari, oo Gospellar tellith y• thoughtis, a nother tellith the wordis, and by this equiuocation either diuers speakinge, they bene accordid. Yea whan they semen contrarie in wordis. Also ofte in storiall mattir, scripture rehersyth the cōmone opinion of mē, and affirmeth not that it was so in dede. In this maner the Gospel seith that Ioseph was the father of Chryste: though he neuer gendrid Christ. For Mary Christis mother was euer clene virgine. Thus the Gospell seyth, that at the beheadyng of Iohn Baptiste, Herod was sorie, & yet as doctours seyne, he was full

glad therof. But he feined him sory▪ for the puple, & the puple gessid hym sory. Also though scriptur do reherse how holimē liuiden &, doth cōmend hem grea

though they do not the counsell: As full many men and womē moune be saued, though they take not virginitie neither continence, neither yeue all here goodis to poore men. And yet these bene here counsellis of Iesu Christ in the Gospell.

For these reasones and other, wyth cōmune charitye to saue al mē in our rewme which God wol haue sauide: a symple creature hath translatyde the Bi ble oute of latyne into Englishe.

                  rly as he could to ye sentence, and to haue many good felowis and kūnyng, at the correctinge of the translation. First it is to know that y• beste transsatyng out of Latyne into Englysh is, to translate after
                     •…
                  he sentence, and not onely after the wordis.
               So that the sentence be as opyn (either opener) in Englyshe as in latyne, and go not farre fro the letter. And if the letter may not be suid in y• translatynge, let the sentence euer be whole and open. For the wordis owen to serue to ye entente and sentēce: and ellis the wordis bene superfluouse either false. In translatyng into English, many resolusiōs moune make the sentēce opē, as an ablatyfe case absolute maye he resolued into

these thre words wt couenable verb the while, for, if, as gramariēs seine. As thus. The master reding, Istōd maye be resolued thus, while y• master readith, I stonde. Either if the master read, ether for the master. &c. And somtime it wold accord well wt the sentēce to be resoluid into whan, ether into aftirward, thus, whā the master red, Istode. Either, after the master read I stode. And sometime it may well be resolued into a verbe of the same tyme, as other ben in the same reason, and into this worde et, that is, and, in English, as thus. Aresentibus hominibus pre timore. That is And men shulen wexe drie for dread. Also a participle of a presente tens, either pretertens of actyfe voicis, either passife: may be resolued into a verbe of the same tens, and a coniūetion copulatyfe, as thus. Dicens. that is seynge maye be resolued thus, and seythe, eyther that seythe.

And thys wole in many placis make the sentence open: where to englyshe it after the word, wold be derke and doubtfull. Also a relatyfe whyche maye be resoluyd into hys anticedēt wyth a cōiunciō copulatife: as thus, which ren

that bene like. At the byginynge I purposyde wyth Goddys helpe: to make the sentence as true & open in englyshe as it is in latine, either more trwe and moore open than it is in latyne. And I praye for charitie and cōmune profyte of chrysten soulys, that if any wysemā fynd any defaut of the trueth of translation: let hym set in the true sentence and open the holy wryte. But loke yt he examyne trulye hys latyn byble: for no doubt he shall fynde many byblis in latyne ful false, if he loke mani. And namely newe, and the cōmune latyne bybles han more nede to be correctyd (as many as I haue sene in my life) thā hath the english bible late trāssated. And where the Hebru, by witnes of Ierom of Lire & other expositours dyscordith fro our Latyne biblis: I haue set in ye margent bi māner of a glose what ye Hebreu hath & howe it is vnderstouden in some place.

For Seinte Ierome was not so holy as the Apostlis and Euangelestis whose bokis he translatid into Latyne, neither he had so high yistis of the holy goste as they hadden. And myche more the. lxx. translatouris weren not so holy, as Moses, and ye Prophetis, and specially Dauid. Neither they hadden so greate yestis of God, as Moses & the Prophetis hadden. Forthermore, holy chirch appreueth not only the true translacion of meane Chrysten men, stidfast in Chrysten fayth: but also of opine Heretikis, that dyden aweye manye mysteries of Iesu Chryst by gyleful translacion, as Ierome wytnessithe in oo Prologe on Iob, and in ye prologe on Daniel. Mych more lette the Chirche of Englande appreuie the trew and holye translacion of simple men, that wollen for no good in erth by hir wyttynge and powre put awaye

the lest truth, yea the lest letter eyther tytle of holy wryte, that beareth substaunce either charge. And dispute they not of the holines of mē nowe lyuyng in this deadly lyfe: for thei knowē not therō, & it is reserued only to godis dome. If they knowē anye notable faute by the translatours either helpars of hem, let hem blame the defaute by charitie, and mercye, and let hem neuer dampne a thynge that maye be done lefully by goddis lawe. As wearing of a good cloth for a tyme, eyther rydinge on an horse for a greate iourney: whā they wytten not wherfore it is done.

                  den the langage of Englyshe men. But they ceasydē neuer tyl they hadden holy write, in here mother tonge of here owne puple. For Ierō that was a Latyne man of byrth translatyd the Byble bothe out of Hebru and oute of Greke into Latyne, and expounded full mych therto.
               And Austyne, & many mo Latins, expouneden the Bible for many partis

into Latyne, to Latyne men, amonge whiche they dwellyden. And Latine was a commone langage to here puple about Rome: and biyandis and on this halfe: as Englishe is commone langage to our puple, & yete this daye: the comō puple in Italye speakith Latten corrupt, as trwe men seine that han bene in Italye. And the noumber of translatouris out of Greke into Latine: passith mans knowynge: as Austyne wytnesseth in the. ii boke of chrysten teachynge: and seyth thus. The translatouris oute of Hebrue into Greke, moune be noumbred.
               But Latyne translatoures, eyther they yt translatidē into Latine, moune not be noumbred in any maner. For in the fyrste tymes of feyth, ech man as a Greke boke came to him and he semed to hymselfe to haue some kun: nynge of Greke and of Latyne, was hardy to translate.

And this thinge helped more thā lettyd vnderstondynge if readars be not negligente. For whye, the biholding of many bokis, hath shewid oft either declarid, some derker sentēcis. Thus seyth Austyne ther. Therfore Grosted seyth yt, it was goddis wyl, that diuers men translatiden, & that diuers translations be in the chirche. For wher one seyd derkly, one either more seyden openly. Lorde God, sithin at y• bigynyng of feyth so many men translatiden into Latine, and to greate profite of Latyne men: lete oo simple creature of God, translate into Englishe for profite of English mē. For if worldly clarkis lokē, well here Cronicles and bokis, they shulē fynd that Bede translatid the Byble and expowned mych in saxon, yt was Englishe either comone langage of this londe in his tyme. And not onely Bede but also Kyng Alured that founded Oxenforde: trāslated in his

last daies, ye bigining of the Psalter into Saxō, & wold more, if he had liued longer. Also Frenshmē, Bemers and Britons, han the Byble & other bokis of deuocion and of exposition, translated in here Mother langage. Whye shuldē not Englishe mē, haue the same in here Mother langage? I can not wit. No but for falsenes and neglegence of clerkis either for oure puple is not worthy to haue so great grace & yist e of God in peyne of here olde synnes. God for his mercye amēd these euil causis: & make our puple to haue and kunne and kepe truly holy wryte to lyfe and deathe. But in translatyng of wordis equiuoke (yt is, that hath many significaciōs vnder oo letter) maye lyghtly be perile. For Austine seyth in ye. ii boke of chri sten teachinge, yt if equiuoke word is be not translated into ye sence either vnderstonding of the autoure it is erroure. As in that place of y• Psalter

The feete of hem be swyfte to shed oute blude: the greke worde is equiuoke to sharpe and swyfte. And he that translatyd sharpe feete: erryd. And a boke that hath sharpe feete, is false and mut be amendyd. As that sentence. Unk

               Austine saith this there. Therfore a translatoure hath greate nede to studye well the sentence both before and after: & loke that such equiuoke wordys accorde wyth the sentence. And he hath nede to lyue a clene lyfe and be ful deuout in praiers, & haue not his wyt occupied about worldly thyngis, that the holy spirite, au, toure of wysdome and kunyng and trueth: dresse hym in hys werke, and suffer hym not for to erre.
