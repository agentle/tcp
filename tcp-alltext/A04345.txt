                  MOST DREAD SOVEREIGNE, that the worthie Acts of Eminent Persons, should alwaies be attended with malignant Enuy, is, vnto ingenuous

               doth appeare vnto some, a meere impossibilitie: Yet seeing the great Philosopher is of opinion, that there is a sort of men who

               thinke, but that the height of Soueraigntie, and

the depth of the Graue, should be freed from this pursuing Furie? but that neither of these (whether Scepter or Sepulcher) can preuaile with some creatures, were there no other instance, the malice of English lesuits enraged with Enuy of your Maiesties admirable iudgement, singular learning, and constant Resolution for Religion; together with the flourishing prosperitie of these your Churches and Kingdomes, giues euidence sufficient; and among them a principall, this Antapologer, shrowded vnder the title of a BANISHED CATHOLIKE, who hath singled out no meaner obiect, against whom to discharge his rankor, then your SACRED MAIESTIES both Person and Apologie through his whole Pamphlet; and also, in a cheife part thereof, the blessed memorie of that Lady (in her time peerelesse) QVEENE ELIZABETH, from before her birth, and below her graue. An infallible demonstration of his degenerous and vnregenerate minde. For none vse to be more spightfully malicious, or Censoriously contumelious, then the debosched abiect, & vnreformed Hypocrite; whom a man can neither auoid without Calumnie, nor encounter but with blot of Infamie, nor Conquer with hope of any

Masterie. That your Maiestie vouchsafed not the Conflict with such a Rake-shame, but adiudged a Rope the fittest answer for him; Premonition before the Apology pag. 13 
               therein your Maiestie shewed your magnanimous spirit, geeuing vnto him his iust doome. And with all humblenesse, I could hartely wish, that your HIGHNES would be pleased, from henceforth, to contemne all the rest, as Him, and not to goe forth any more vnto these Battails (they will glorie in it though they be sure to receaue the foile) euen the Generall of their Campe, were his learning greater, or his Crowne higher, is no match for SVCH a King. Shall they then passe altogether vnconfronted? In no wise; the Infection spreads to farre, and silence (though with contempt) they of that ranke will account an ouerthrow. But I trust your Maiestie shall finde, among your Subiects, many, which maie with more truth and lesse vaunt, say as much as Campian their highly

among those many I confesse my selfe to be; yet in zeale toward your Maiestie, and in iust indignation against this Rabshekah, I haue vndertaken the answer to his Censure; which, being finished, I humbly present to your Maiesties Patronage, for two principall respects: first, because it is in the true Iustification of your Maiesties late vnanswerable Apologie for that OATH of ALLEGIANCE, which, like to Ieptha his Shiboleth, discouereth the true Israelite from the false-harted 
                  Iudg. 12. 6. 
               Fugitiue, and rebellious Ephraemite. Secondly, because what is in it for soundnesse of Argument, or truth of Storie, is, in a manner, your Maiesties owne; who, at the first sight of both these Antapologists, could readilie discerne their falsities, and presently refell with sound answer any quarrell that they made. If, therein, some tearmes haue passed, not fully Episcopall, or not so fitting (perhaps) the calling and place, which, vnder your Maiesties, and by your Gratious fauour, I hold in the Church; I trust the Readers eie will from Me be first turned vpon Him that prouok't; who is knowne for these many yeares to be of a prostitued Conscience and Impudence, not careing what hee writes; nor whom he reuiles; nor how 'tis taken:

as also to those excellent Personages, TVVO SACRED PRINCES successiuely raigning; whom he hath in the basest sort (with his scorning Ribauldry) defiled and besmeered: that gulfe in Rome being not so vnsauorlie noisome to the Citie, as his reproachfull Contumelies and opprobrious slaunders, odious and offensiue to the best affected Subiects of this your Land. Into which Gulfe, if by casting my selfe (of Dutie to your Roiall Maiestie, and in memorie of my late deere Mistresse, and for contentment of your true-harted people) I proue not so happie, as that Romane was by 
                  Curtius apud Liuium. 
               running into the other, to choake vp the sinke from sending out, for euer after, such loathsome sauor; yet this good (at least) I shall doe, by drawing AL the filth vpon MY SELFE, keepe it off, either from further annoiance of your Sacred Maiesty or from a generall noisance. For seeing he can not hold, but must needes regorge (his spirit is so turbulent and vnquiet) and as Ierom speaketh of Heluidius, Maledicere omnibus bonae conscientiae signum arbitratur, he thinkes his conscience 
                  Hieronim ad. uer. Heluid, 
               then best discharged, when he hath reviled most: against ME let him emptie his whole quiuer of reproaches; all of them, I hope, will bee

like the Romish arrowes shot against Sebastian, drawne with bent force, loo'st with much ease, but receiu'd with strong comfort; Et quem veritate Ambros. in. Psal. 118. Idem. non potest, laceret conuitijs, since hee is too weake to dispute, let him lash on with his tongue. This ONE aduantage he shall be sure to get by that licence, that he shall put me to silence; for personall Calumnies I regard not, especially from Parsons, whose verie name is the Epitome of all Contumelie, beeing as currant in a Prouerbe as was once the name of Daedalus, in omni Fabula, Vide Erasm. Chiliad. & Daedali execratio: for no Libell can come from Rome, but PARSONS is presently supposed and noised to be the Author; and the more vile, the more PARSONS like. If the obiection bee, that I haue not spared from reproaching HIM, I deny it not; how could I forbeare, or who can blame me? None, that hath either Loiall heart to your Maiestie, beeing our Gracious Soueraigne, or Christian regard of Her (who late was) that euer-blessed Queene. Yet there, in haue I dealt with him no otherwise, then the Apostle with the Cretians: as he out of a Poeme of their owne Prophets; so I, out of the 
                  Tit. 1. 12. Bookes of his Fellow-Preists, giue him the sameQuodlibet. Iust. defence. &c.
               
(and no other) tearmes of reproach or bitternesse, which men of the same religion with him, haue described him by, in Print; and, vnto the worlds veiw haue confidently a vowed of him. If hee SO requite me, and quote the printed Authors, I open my selfe vnto HIM, and will indure THEM; If otherwise, I must repute him as a Slanderer, and weare them as my Garland: comforting my selfe with that Conclusion of S. Hierom, Caninam Ierom. vbi supra. facundiam Seruus Domini pariter experiatur, & Vnctus, accounting it my Glorie, that the same Creature should rage and snarle at ME the Lords vnworthie Minister, which hath not spared TVVO ROIALL MONARCH Sthe Lords annointed, and amounted. In hande ling the maine points, I trust it will appeare that I haue neither dallied with him, nor illuded the Reader; so that, from anie sound replie thereto I dare assure my selfe securitie from HIM. Verbalize he can, dispute he cannot; In Stories he is a great flourisher, but a false Relator of them: who so inioines him a modest answer, doth vndoe him; neither his age, nor profession; neither shame of the world, nor feare of God, nor grace of the spirit, can mortifie his nature, or restraine his tong.

But be the Reply any, or none, modest or distemper'd, your Sacred Maiestie I trust, shal be freed; whom, I besech the eternall God, still to preserue, in prolonging your daies to your Subiects comfort; and in strengthning your arme, not with Pen anie more to confute (it giues them too great Honour) but with Iustice to confound, and with courage to cast off such seducing spirits; restles in nourishing disloialties; cruell in plotting mischieus; and too subtile in veiling Treasons vnder the title of Religion: and account this as your great blessing (amongst the rest) from the great God that he hath made your Maiestie (a thing rare in so high a State) a Protectour of the Faith, both with Pen and Sword; and a partaker also of his Sonnes reproach, for So being. To the sauing grace of which blessed Iesus, I, in all humblenesse commend your Highnesse, resting

            An Admonition to the Reader.
            
               GENTLE READER, the IESVIT his speeches, through this whole booke, are printed in the smaller letter, al waies with this mark " in the beginning of the line prefixed. HIM I haue tearmed the EPISTLER, CENSVRER, and ANTAPOLOGER, because in a pretended LETTER, he passeth his CENSVRE against that learned & religious APOLOGY, made and set forth by our most Gratious & truely renowned Soueraigne. The stile, in respect of my place and profession, may, peraduenture, be adiudged too bitter; but compared with his Person, and reuiling veine against two such Christian Monarches, no one IOTE thereof in exact Suruiew of better iudgement, is either pared off, or spared at all. Faults many haue escaped

tn printing partly vpon negligence, partly ihrough hast; but the most of them, are but either a few letters mis-placed, or dropt out; or else points not so curiously set, or some matginall quotations drawne a little higher or lower, perhaps, then they should; which an ingenuous Reader will pardon, & a learned will espie: those which HEE or any such as HE can carp at, are very few; which it may please thee with thy pen to amend, btfore thou read it.
         
      
      
         
            
            NVMB. 1.
            
               
                  THere is no END of making many books (saith the Preacher in the end of his Eccl. 12. 12. booke) especially if they be bookes of Encounter: Whereof there is no End, either for Cessation, because reuengefull spirits, fostered with rancor, are euer restlesse; which made Plato Sympos. the Philosopher to say, that Braules were easily begun, not so soone taken vp: nor End, for Profit; So Nazianzene expounds that speech of Salomon, because Metaph. in Eccles. the parties interessed (which the Orator obserued) either through selfe-loue, or pertinacie, will not bee drawne from what they haue published, by any arguments of the aduerse side, though many and forcible: and the indifferent Reader finding in such writings more partiall bitternesse then sound

               dealing, looseth his time, which is pretious in it selfe, and might in more profitable studies bee imploied: whereof Cal
                     •…
                  ach. came the Heathens prouerbiall sentence, that a great Booke was a great Mischiefe.
            
            2 All which, the Criticall Censurer of the Triplex Cuneus (if we be not deceiued in the Author) acknowledgeth Preface to his Manifestatiō. elsewhere, and preferreth a reposed life, before such contentious iangling: which if he did truely affect, not in pretence, he might well haue left the blunting or dislodging of the tripled wedge, either to him that weares the tripled Crowne, or to him, who vnder his Red-Cap breathes after it: for

this busines concerned them both, the Pope for his Breues, the Cardinall for his Letter: this Censuring Epistler it touched no whit.
            3 Whom to answer, might bee thought both endlesse and needlesse: needlesse, for his Letters being onely a fardle of conceits, either sleight and vnsound, or malicious and vntrue, they carie their answer with them, and, as the Prophet speaketh in an other case, Agnitio vultus earum respondet eis: They beare there owne confutation in their foreheads. Esa. 3. 9. 
               Endlesse, for an itching arme desires still to bee scrub'd, and an Eele delights not more in troubled waters, then hee, whose onely glory is in scornefull Inuectiues, reioiceth to haue occasion giuen for his busie pen.
            4. Yet sithence his Censure vnanswered might infect others, and giue him occasion to triumph in his owne vanitie: and peraduenture some partially affected might imagine, that not contempt of his reasonlesse railing, but lacke of good grounds for reply had inforced a silence; I haue harkned to King Salomon his affirmatiue aduise, and for suting an answer in some measure proportionably, haue Prou. 26. 5. taken no other then his owne vnmethodicall Method, both for his trebled Paragraph, and his multiplied Numbers, which is more sincere dealing then hee affoordeth the Apopologie; for what he could wrest or cauell at, that wee finde answered: that which apposeth him, hee passed in silence, and wee take it granted as truth: (for silence implieth, if not consent, yet no deniall.) Not that I meane De reg. Iuris.

                  ons, as serue to the proofe of each chiefe point, as hee entitles them.

            Paragraph. 1. Numb. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7.
            Wherein, first, as if hee were in a troubled poole, hee

casteth out his angle to fetch out an Author; and lest either his bait or skill should seeme to faile him (as Anthony deale with Cleopatra at his fishing in Egipt) he fasteneth to his Hooke one out of his owne store, namely: Plut. in Anto

                  Another T. M. (forsooth) an inferiour Minister neere his Maiesty, to whom hee might shew the Booke, and so publish it with his Maiesties authoritie, print and Armes; marry his Maiestie is so farre from being the author therof, as that (in this Criticks perswasion) he did not so much as read all the Contents aduisedly; many passages therein beeing contrarie to the Kings iudgement & Honour. Numb. 2. Namely for iudgement, first altering the Question twice or thrice. Secondly charging Bellarmine (so great a man) with eleuen Contradictions, not one of them so to bee prooued, as not onely learned but unlearned will find. Numb. 3. As in that concerning Iustification and Antichrist particularly. Num 4. 5. but especially, both in that generall assertiue note, that Bellarmine, beeing driuen to a pinch, careth not to contradict himselfe for a present auoidāce; as also in that stinging cōclusion, that Heauen & Hell doe not more differ, then Gods Bookes and Bellarmines workes doe, concerning the dignitie of Temporall Princes. Numb. 7 Secondly, for honour; there being such Phrases of contempt against the Pope, and against the great Cardinall also, calling him Master Bellarmine, which his Maiestie would, in Law of Honour, surely condemne.
               
            
             Numb. 6.
            6 To treade his steps, wee might also dally with the Reader to retriue an Author, and inquire (as he doth) pro & cotra, who this English Exile, this Epistling Censurer should be? whether R. P. or N. D. or F. P. or P. R. or Doleman, that is, vnder all these Ciphers, Parsons the Iesuite? whom his owne brother entituleth a Raunging-voluntary 
               Vnder his owne hand. Quodlib. pa. 238. 239. 
               Runagate, not in Exile by authoritie; whome his owne Priests do stile an Hispanized Camelion, the Brat of an Incubus, filius terrae, no true Englishman, either in heart or by birth.
            
               
7 That HE should not bee the man, these rea
                  •…
               ons are probable; First, it much greeueth HIM yea, HE accounts it a violence offered him to interrupt the course of his peaceable 
               Preface to his Manifestation 
               Priestly labours, by entring into a warre of writing: therefore for HIM, like an other G

                  liah, (Pigmae as he is) to enter this combat, not prouoked there vnto, and vpon such disaduantage, cannot sort with HIS retired profession.
            
            Secondly, that HE, a man of no inferiour talent (so he pub lisheth of himselfe) an Author of no meane labours, should, like an other Ahimaas, needes thrust himselfe to carrie a Manifestation pag. 51. 2. Sam. 18. 12. 
               Message, hauing neither leaue nor errand; that is, should write so shallow a Pamphlet, whereout, rid those offalls of Sophistry, Railings, and some addle Discourses; of the remnant ye may truely say, as Ahimaaz of his owne message, Vidi tu multum, sed nesc

                  ud, is scarcely coniecturall. Vers. 29.
            
            Thirdly, if Parsons were euer famous for any good thing, he woon himselfe credit by the booke of Resolution, though not inuented (as the Priests say) but borrowed peece-meale from others; translated only, and methodized by him: which Quodlib. pa. 71. 237. when a man reades, he will take the Compiler or translator to be that very Crucifix of Mortification described by Saint Gal. 6. 14. 
               Paul, The world crusified vnto him, and he vnto the world: now that HE should fall into such passionate prophane, and Barbarously-distempered 
               Pag. 27. &c. 
               reuiling of a Christian Princesse, the mirror of the world while she liued, some yeares dead, and laid vp in rest with her Fathers; as if the very mention of HER Sacred Name, were an Eleborous purge to make him disgorge the gall of his bitternesse, and the venemous rancor of his cankred heart, by his Rabshakeis pen; no man that professeth the name of Christ, can beleeue it to bee the labour of one that is ingralted into Christ: For they that are Christs, haue 
               Gal 5. 24. 
               crucified the flesh with the passions and lusts; sauing that one of his owne Priestly Coat assureth vs, that, for all this Resolued or Resoluing Diuinity, he hath not as yet fully cast off the 
               Iust. defene. pag. 297. 
               outward man.
            
            8 And yet that he should be the Author, besides the gerall

report, and certaine intelligence, First, his straining at the elder T. M. as he cals him, is euid

               Tho. Morton Deane of Glocester. (which Parsons vnder the dumbe Characters of P. R. vndertakes to patronize by a Mitigation) like Pope Adrians Flie, will not leaue troubling the Iesuites throat till hee hath forced out his gall, heart and all. Secondly, the so cunninglie concealing his knowledge of the Apologies true Author, wherein hee sheweth himselfe to bee right Doleman, not as himselfe deriues the name of Dolor, virdolorum, as a man of Manifestat. page 51. griefe, repleat wi
                  •…

               Es. 53. being, as his owne Priests tearme him, the Abstract quintessence of all coynes, coggeries, and forgeries; that lies, dissembles, and equiuocates at euery word. 
               Quodlib. page 236.
            
            9 For is it probable that Parsons, who makes himselfe another Elizeus, takes vpon him to knowe what is done 2. Reg. 6. 12. and spoken in the Kings Priuy Chamber, (as it seemes by that he writs page 37. concerning T. M. the younger) that HE, the great Intelligencer among States, who weekely spends fiue or sixe Crownes for postage of letters onely (as the Priests of his owne ranke report) should bee ignorant that our Soueraigne King himselfe was Author of the Apologie, 
               Iust. defence. page 236. it being not onely in euery mans mouth stiled by the name of the Kings Booke, but the warrant in the frontispice (which this Confuter obserueth) Autoritate Regiâ,

               owing, though not proclaming it to the world, that it was his Maiesties doing? (for you shall not finde, to my remembrance, a booke of an English man extant, in those wordes warranted, but the King himselfe hath a hand in it) which the Iesuite knew well enough, as vnder those Ciphers of T. M. he implies; for by them, if he will speake without Aequiuocation, hee meant TVA or TANTA MAIESTAS: but being guiltie to himselfe that hee cannot write with

modestie, he faines an aduersary to himselfe, through whose sides he might lash his Sacred Matestie with le

                is an addition of Worship. Did his Maiestie call him Master Cardinall? then had those instances some semblances of fit application. No, but hee called him Master Bellarmine. And is the stiling him Master Bellarmine, such a Scandalum magnatum? In which of the words rests it? in Bellarmine?

            15 Is it in Master? Better men, both for honour and vertue then the Cardinall euer will bee, haue not refused that title in any age or language. Take the Hebrew Rabbi, it was giuen our Sauiour Christ by those that wished him neither Contempt nor disgrace, as by Nicodemus a Ruler of the Iewes (and therefore knew what belonged to manners) who was no bad friend to our blessed Sauiour, as appeareth Iohn. 7. and hee So saluted him; as also by the holy conuert Mary Magdalen, who called him Rabboni, that is to Ioh. 7. 51. say) saith the Euangelist) Master.

               Latin when S. Cyprian would grace Tertullian most, hee would call for him in that title Da Magistrum; and Peter Lombard hath the name Master giuen vnto him aboue

all their Schoole Doctors, as an Antonomasticall eminence of note and stile.
            15 And therefore, seeing neither God himselfe, nor Gods Liuetenants on earth, whether Emperours or Kings (from whom all true titles of honour are deriued) haue giuen this name or dignitie, but a Pope onely inuented it, without sound warrant; what reason had his Maiestie to take such respectfull knowledge thereof? Of which, euen a Bishop did make so meane account, that hee refused then to be created a Cardinall, because (hee said) hee would not descend from a higher to a lower place. For the true first institution of Cardinals was but to be Vicar; of the particular Parish-churches of Rome, vnder the Bishop thereof; howsoeuer now, by the iniquitie of time, the pride of Popes, and the sloth of Christian Princes, they are start vp from Parish-Priest's to be Princes Peeres, taking it in scorne to be called Master's, euen by Princes. And yet, if his Maiestie had either continually thorow the Booke, or at least at his first naming of him, called him Master, it had beene some thing, but since he is so farre from being ceremonious in giuing of Titles vnto him, as sometimes hee calleth him Bellarmine, sometimes Cardinall, sometimes Cardinall Bellarmine, and seldomest Master Bellarmine of any of them, heereby may the groundles and malitious quarrel of this shallow wrangler most cleerely appeare.
            16 But why is it not as lawfull for so Mighty a King to call the Cardinall Master Bellarmine, as for euery Popish Scribler (euen this fugitiue Tenebrio, Parsons himselfe) hauing occasion to name our Arch-Bishops and Bishops (dignities meerely Apostolicall, and therefore more honorable) neuer to stile them otherwise but Master Cranmer, and Master Whitguift, Master Ridley, and Master Iewell? Yea, wee must bee beholden vnto them, if they bee pleased to affoord them a title so mannerly and ciuill. But enough of this; the truth and conclusion whereof is, if this MASTER (forsooth) of Ceremonies had the grace to leaue

            17 We now come to his Censure (such as it is) of the Apologies substance; the reducing whereof into an orderlie Analysis for answer (of which he made no conscience at all in his Pamphlet) will trouble a man more then the answering it selfe. The Preamble to the Breues, concerning the nature of the Oath, the Contents thereof, with the Popes proceeding therein; the Examination of Bellarmines Letter to the Arch priest is the Diuision he makes of the Apologie, Num. 8.  (or rather was made to his hand, for he shewes not so much Logicke in his whole Censure.)
            
            Paragraph 1. Numb. 9 10. 11.
            18 The Preamble is a Colloquintida vnto him, not so much in respect of the Epithetes giuen to the POWDER-TREASON, of monstrous, rare, nay neuer heard of treachrous, famous and infamous attempt; it descrues them, saith hee: but first, that it should be SINGVLAR FROM ALL EXAMPLES, there hauing beene the like done by Protestants (though not in specie, yet in indiuiduo) as at Autwrep, the Hage, & in Scotland. Secondly, that it should be Crambe his posita so often repeated, the parties being executed. Thirdly, that the Kings promise and Proclamation being, that other Catholikes

                This is Mors in Olla, and makes him dilate his Stile into dolefully Rhetoricall expostulations.
            
            19 The Epithetes please them well now, which aggrauate the detestation of the fact; but had there not beene (as Decad. 1. lib. 1. 
               Liuie speaketh in a Case of treachery) error insidiatoris, their applause had beene greater in the attestation thereof; Such actions are not commended but when they are finished: So Hall (alias Old cor

            20 But were the attempt so odious and lothsome, as this tender-stomacks Censurer maketh it, wherefore is the Coriphaus of that Complot (Garnet I meane) turned to a Miracle and his Face made to aequiuoate after his death? one rotting vpon the Bridge for his horrible Treason, the other shining in a straw for his Ghostly puritie? and why in Spaine is his Picture drawn with two ropes about his necke, & his bowels (like an other Iudas) trilling down his body, with the inscription of a Martyr for the Catholike cause? yea, by this Censurer his fellow-Traytor himselfe so entituled and maintained? In his Epistle to Sir Ed. Cooke. Sect. 51. but that their meaning is to en-ammell, with a glorious pretence of Sacramentall Confession, the Counselling, supporting and Concealing an HIDEOVS TREASON.
            
            21 Which, howsoeuer this Censurer straines at it, is, both in Specie & indiuiduo SINGVLARFROM ALL EXAMPLES, and not to be Paralel'd with any one out of ancient or moderne Historian or Poet, either in

               Fact or Fiction; as if of purpose their meaning were to doe an Act which should put the Holy Ghost to Schoole, and consure his Maxim penned by Salomon, that Nihil nouum sub sole. For weighing all circumstances, of conspiracie, parties,

            22 And it seemes this Censurer doth; else would hee not mention those of Antwerpe, Hage and Scotland; the first in open Hostilitie, what time all actions for discomfiture are lawfull, either by sleight or Force: the other a plot of one single man, and in reuenge vpon the States for giuing him discontent, and by the report of some writers hee was Meteranus Lib. 11. 
               distraught and mad. But by his noting of the last he discouereth the rancor of his heart against our Soueraigne; for though the execution of Paricides and murthers vpon Princes, hath eft-soones alighted vpon some of the greatest and best of that royall sort, that euer were, and therefore no dishonour to them nor their posteritie; yet to cast vp such a disastrous example in his Maiesties teeth, prooueth well that he is sorie that his Maiestie escaped the like perill, whom hee so earnestly wished to haue beene his Fathers successor in such a fortune, as hauing by hope deuouted the same, he came on his iourney a good step (as some report) towards England, that he might haue sung a Te Deum in his natiue Countrey, for the good successe of that happy exploit. And yet that all men may see how malice blindeth iudgement in this his resemblance, the truth is that his Maiesties rather was not blowen vp with Gun-powder, but after that the murtherers had strangled him in his bed sleeping, hee was carried out to the Garden, and then was the house blowne vp, to make the world beleeue that it was but a Casuall accident of fire: and so what semblance of comparison is there betweene the Powder-Treason and it?

The Relikes of their dismemberd carkasses are erected for a prey to the Fowles of the Ayre to feed on, the villanie of their designed Crueltie to be reiterated vpon all occasions, for the Nations of the earth, and all Posteritie to wonder at. And therefore haue patience (Gentle Iesuite) for our so oft repeating it; wee first say with Chrysostome,

               Philip. 3. 1. 
               profitable, if not to worke your conuersion by repentance, yet to make men, at least, inamored with your Profession, that warranteth such Acts good in Religion.
            
            25 And therefore yee did well to call those detestable Traitors (after the Discouerie and Conuictions) CATHOLIKE Gentlemen, as if yee would insinuate, that they died in a Catholike Cause; and in an other place, INFORTVNATE GENTLEMEN, not for their fortunes and state in the world, (they were too great, vnlesse they had more grace) but for their VNLVCKIE SVCCESSE, in missing their designed purpose. Sic foelix scelus virtus vocatur. Had it beene effected, Moses and Phinees should haue beene reported inferiour to those Gentlemen in zeale for Gods cause. Else why did Hall the forenamed Iesuite (a Ringleader of this desperate crue) comfort himselfe and Littleton with the defeature and discouery of those horrible Traitors, by the Examples of the Eleuen Tribes of Israell twise discomfited, though sent by Gods especiall Commandement, (marke that:) then of Lewis the French King, ouerthrowne in sight against Infidels in a case of Religion: and lastly, of the Christians vanquished by the Turkes in the defence of Rhodes? but that hereby hee would conclude they were vnfortunate Gentlemen, scilicet, that their cause for vndertaking was good, but their lucke was ill in missing: otherwise it is too gentle a title for such odious creatures.
            26 And so this Censurer also (a part-taker no doubt, in the Complot) cheares vp himselfe not only perswading, but definitiuely determining, that Both afflictions outward, and pressures of conscience inward, caused this POWDER TREASON: which is a shamelesse vntruth (yea euen themselues being Iudges) for that the Conspiracie was plotted before any hard
               
               measure thought of, by their owne confession is manifest. For the Lands Inuasion (a Treason no lesse desperate, though more manly and visible then the POWDER-PLOT) in the late Queenes time of famous memory motioned, was immediatly and hotly pursued by those very parties; and aduertisements giuen to Forren States, whose ayd they requested, that our King WAS LIKE to proceed rigorously (this fellow saith, that the rigor was put in execution) with the Catholikes, and to run the same course which the late Queene did.
            
            27 Secondly, these Conspirators were combined in the first yeare of the King, when (so far was the thought of any Seueritie) that, as it was openly prooued, for the space of a Preceedings against the late Traitors. whole yeare and foure moneths, no Penaltie by Statute was taken of Recusants: Insomuch that Doctor Bishop, who wrote his booke in Anno 1604. euen the yeare before the detecting of the POWDER-TREASON, acknowledged the Kings most milde carriage in gouernment THITHERTO: Epist. dedica. to the King. pa. 10. and yet, it's worth the enquirie, what the same Doctor should meane by those desperate words in the very same Epistle, when he saith, That the state being now setled, and a continuall posteritie like to ensue in one nature, God knoweth what that forcible weapon of necessitie may driue men to at the length. It seemes then some such thing was plotting, euen in that Eadem pag. 12 
               confessed time of mildnesse.
            
            28 Thirdly their owne reason of their engining against the Parlament house, because say they, vniust Lawes had there formerly (not in the Kings time any) beene made against the Catholikes, confutes this bold assertion: which were it true, that Seueritie in executing some Lawes went before this plot, did not the Prieste Treason, euen at the Kings first entrance iustly enforce it? Belike it greeues them that his Maiestie (as the Prophet speaketh) would not corpus dare percutientibus, yeeld his body to the Smiters, Es. 50. 6. and his cheekes to the nippers; and still like a Lambe before the Butcher, not once open his mouth: or rather

That subiects should binde their allegeance to their Soueraigne for his securitie by OATH, hath beene both vsuall in all Nations Christian and Heathen, and as ancient a Custome in our Land to the Princes thereof, as that Iuramentum fidelitatis exacted by the Pope of his Vassals; commended by Bellarmine 
               De Pontif. Rom. lib. 7. cap 11. for antiquitie, because continued from the time of Gregory the great; and is grounded vpon Scripture, both in the examples of holy Kings, and the Apostles definition of an Oath; namely that it is

               the end of all 
               Heb. 6. 16. 
               Controuersie. Wherein take this very case; the Antilogia or controuersie whereof is, Whether any Romish Catholike can be are any true allegeance in his heart, vnto the Kings Maiestie? This Iesuite in many places of his booke holds the affirmatiue; wee by effects of so many Treasonable Plots of Priests and Iesuites, do hold the contrarie: yea, the Priests of the same Religion are meerely contradictory to

him, while they say, that the Execution of Priest hood and Treason are now so linked together by the Iesuites in England, 
               Quodlib. pag. 304. 
               as they cannot exhort any to the Catholike faith, but dogmatizando in so doing they drawe him in effect to Rebellion. For the taking vp of the Antilogie, and the better securing himselfe of his owne saftie, and his Subiects loyaltie, what other Remedy could his Maiestie thinke of then this of the Apostles, by OATH, both assertorie for the present, and promissorie for the future assurance? which is no other but what his Royall Ancestors in this Iland haue done before him many 
               Vide our Chronicles & Polyd. Virgil. 
               and often.
            
            37 The NOVELTY then, belike is in the forme of the Oath; not as it is receiued by them tactis Euangelijs, that is Iustinian. in Authent. no moderne inuention; Iustinian long since prescribed it: but as it is conceiued by the State to bee done in the true Faith of a Christian without Aequiuocation. This is, in sooth, that 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , that pressure of conscience vnder which hee groaneth, as appeareth by him, where hee complaineth, Pag. 19. & 32. that the OATH excludes them from all Aequiuocating: the Triall of which complaint wee referre to that place, or rather (though it greeue him) to the elder T. M. that is, Tuus Mastix (in that point) Fa. Parsons. In the meane time obserue the integritie and diuinitie of this Censurer, who makes that a New Pressure of Soule, which Saint Augustine (grounding himselfe vpon that speech of the Psalmist, Qui 
               Psal. 15. 4. 
               iurat proximo & non decipit) concluces to be of olde, the full and faithfull discharge of Conscience; namely, that a man

               should sweare according to the minde of him that ministreth, not of him that taketh the Oath, especially when hee knoweth the Iudges minde, by the wordes of the Oath.
            
            38 And now wee follow him to examine the weight of this pressure, which he aggrauateth by an Ironicall Sarcasmus against his Maiestie, vnder the Ciphers of T. M. For vsing the worde ONLY, (an exception mitigating;) as if the taking of this Oath were so lightly to bee esteemed, as to be thrust vpon them with an ONLY, (scilicet, the

King intended no hard Vsage to the Catholikes, ONELY a forme of oath was framed to be taken &c.) as if that were so easie a thing which is an extremitie of Rigor: for if it be taken, it hazards the Soule by swearing against their Conscience; if not taken, it endangereth their worldly estate by losse of goods, life, and libertie. Num. 12.
            39 To be Verborum auceps, is a right Aequiuocators tricke. Who knoweth not, that the word ONELY doth not so much signifie an hypocoristicall alleuiation, as a Compendiary limitation? He that said to our Sauiour, ONELY Math. 8. 8 
               speake the word, did not thereby extenuate the power of Christ, as if healing in absence, by a speech, had beene a more easie miracle, then by approach to touch the partie; but thereby wished a course more easefull to the body, not lesse powerfull to shewe the Deity of our Sauiour. And so his Maiestie by the word ONELY, signifieth, that omitting all other courses of Enquiry into his Subiects allegeance, hee tooke that ONELY course to frame an OATH: not heereby implying the taking of an Oath to bee an easie charge, (because Oathes presse vpon the Soule) but more expedit for euidence, and the readier way for the assurance of his owne State, and the manifestation of his subiects affections. But grant that ONELY bee an alleuiating particle, yet it is so by comparison: and so is an OATH, a tryall of more ease, both to body and minde then are those other meanes by Rackes and tortures (vsuall in the Inquisition:) for as the peines are vnsufferable to flesh and blood, so haue they a very perculsiue force euen vpon the Soule, Nam & innocentes cogit mentiri dolor, saith the Stoicke, because in so many streights, of terrour, Seneca. payne, hope, feare, nihil veritati loci relinquitur, as the Orator well obserued, (let Aelian speake of the Egyptians courage or insensiblenes what he will): men will say Ci

            40 And this Oath (saith this Censurer) doth as much;

for it driues men into Dauids dilemma of streights, to fall either into the hands of God or men; of God, if the Oath be taken, because they sweare against their conscience; of men, in that their goods, life & libertie are liable to law. And good reason for the last; because euery Statute hauing the Penaltie annexed, none can be more fit and proper for the breach of this, then Confiscation and death: for hee is vnworthy to enioy either wealth, ease, or life, vnder a Christian King, who being required, denieth to sweare his Allegeance and obedience to his Soueraigne against all persons; which euery true affected subiect should voluntarily offer. For the first, their swearing against Conscience, the answer must bee referred, where hee inlargeth that point; for he runnes the wilde-goose-chase, backward and forward: within two leaues he confesseth (as if he lost himselfe) two returnes. In the meane time he must know that a Conscience may be misled by error, or stifned by pertinacie: and thē the Greek Diuines will tell him, that vnsoundnesse in the Iudgement, and obstinacie

               nick-named, which is more properly to bee called ignorance and peruersnesse, and rather to bee censure then tendred.
            
            41 But all this his Maiestie had by a double anticipation preuented; first, that neither the OATH NOR PENALTIE Apolog. pa. 4. 
               thereof was intended against any for their opinion and conscience, but onely for acknowledgement and assurance of their Ciuill Obededience: Secondly, that many of both sorts, popishly affected, had freely taken it, and thereby had freed both themselues from suspicion of disloialtie, and the Oath from the slander of pressure: and both these the Censurer obserueth and answereth, Num. 13. the first by a concession: 
                  If it bee so, the matter is ended, saith hee: for no Catholike will denie to sweare all Ciuill Obedience THAT HE OWES TO HIS MAIESTIE.
               
            
            42. Wherein I pray you marke how Sorex seipsum, how Treason hatched in the heart cannot conceale it selfe

from vttering, though in hidden tearmes; for obserue those words, ALL OBEDIENCE THAT HE OWES TO HIS MAIESTIE: what is that, and how farre extends it? Saint Peter stretcheth it without limitation, Submit your selues to all manner ordinance for the Lords sake. Peters Successor (so called) hee limits it, with 1. Pet. 5. 13. 
               Saluâ semper autoritate Apostolicâ, as in the Councell of Trent: the Successors Parasite, this Traiterous Claw-backe minseth it with a distinction in ordine ad spiritualia: whereupon, Numb. 30. as Tertullian saith in an other case, Nisihomine Deus placuerit, Deus non erit; so, if the King please not the Pope, 
               Apologet. he shall be denounced an Hereticke, and so Cataloguised on Holy-Thursday: hee shall bee pronounced no Christian, as Matth. Tortus page 97. the writhen-vexed Cardinall (so he entitles himselfe, and indeed writes as though hee were wroong with the colike) hath already passed his Sentence; and so consequently no King; or if a King, yet without Subiects: for they must renounce their Obedience, and the King his safetie and authoritie.
            
            43 The second he answereth by an Interrogation, such as the Rhetoricians call 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , a question reprehensiue at least expostulatory, why Blackwell and Charnocke, hauing Hermogen. taken the Oath, are still imprisoned!
            
            44 This Polypragmon would faine be a priuy Councellor: he hath wrong that his Maiestie acquainteth him not with all occurrences of State, and reasons of his proceedings. To resolue his question either by coniecture or truth, I endeuour not; Jam not his Intelligencer: to answer a scorne is folly. Onely as the parents said of their sonne borne blinde, miraculously cured, so say I for Master Blackwell, Aetatem habet: and if hee might freely speake, hee Iohn 9. would say with Dauid, Let the righteous smite mee, that's a benefit: Oleum autem peccatoris, but let not their precious

               his published Breue: which this fellow answereth, first by deducing the cause that brought foorth the Breue, namely a doubt made about the Oath. Secondly, the doubt consulted

Might not your Arch-Priest Blackwell, so authorized by the Pope, so commended and countenanced by two Cardinals, Caietan and Burghesius, so intrusted with regencie of Soules ouer the whole Land, to whom al were enioined to repaire for decisions and questions; might not (I say) HIS iudgement carry as much sway for the KINGS SOVERAIGNTY against some few Iesuited, as HIS Censure alone against all the Seculars, yea against the definitiue of the whole facultie of Diuines in Declarat. motunm. pag. 1 10. 
               Paris, for the support of his owne authoritie?
            50. In the case and doubts about the late horrible Treason, Garnet and Hall were thought sufficient Oracles to resolue and determine for it against the King, without recourse to the Pope (for ought HE would bee knowen:) In cases concerning loyaltie and allegiance to his Maiestie, Blackwell and many his associates cannot resolue for the King but the Pope must be first consulted. Was it because there is no God in Israel to enquire of his word, said Elias of 
               2. Reg. 1. 16.
               
               Ahaziah, that you must send Messengers to Baalzebub the God of Ekron? Hath not God answered by Vrim, nor by Prophets? 
               1. Sam. 28 6. is not his will concerning allegeance to Kings in so many places sufficiently reuealed in his word, but recourse must be had to a Sooth-sayer in Endor? I will not vrge that bitter speech of the Secular Priests, it is to sharpe; yet the time is not long, since they said, that for the decision of doubts, the Catholikes must depend vpon the Arch-priest, the 
               Quodlib. pa. 151. 
               Arch-priest vpon Garnet; Garnet vpon Parsons; and Parsons vpon the Deuill: yet then there was a Pope able to Iudge: but onely it would be knowne which is the second answer fitting this point.
            51 What there is in THIS Pope for iudgement in Diuinity, that His determination should bee expected about the OATH of allegeance to his Maiestie, more then in his predecessor Clemens, whose opinion was not inquired of about the OATH for conspiracy against the whole Realm; Of Pius Quintus, who absolued the late Queenes Subiects from their obedience, it was said by some of his owne, that he was Homo pius & doctus, sed nimis credulus, religious, and learned, but to easie of beleefe: Of this Paulus Quintus, who hath interdicted the subiects of our soueraigne King, to sweare their obedience, either for his diuinity or pietie, we haue heard nothing. S. Peter, whose successor he is stiled, S. Paul, whose name he hath borrowed, had their diuinitie indeed by infusion; but their writings reuealed it to the world: so that Peter we know and Paul we know to be singular diuines, but WHO IS THIS? No man who seeketh to be famous, doth any things in secret, say the Brethren of our Sauiour. 
               Ioh. 7. 4. Where then are his labours; his Sermons; his Treatises; his Commentaries; his Epistles Theologicall, his Doctrinall determinations; his Iudiciall decisions? all which are the vsuall attractiues to draw an opinion vpon a man, that hee is a sound Resoluer: but in all these, as the Greeke Poet speaketh Plut. Lucull. 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , as if he were Pythagoras his Scholler, hee is wholly silent.
            
               
52 Into his qualities I wil not enter: hee stands and fals to his owne Master: but if he bee that Cardinall Burghesius whom some of the Secular Priests haue sometime described, M. Bluet. &c. and haue assured vs that to be true in him, which Plut. in Tiber. is spoken of Tiberius Gracchus, that he is 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               : A rash speaker, and an heady vndertaker; of a most violent spirit, and impatient of contradiction, in whatsoeuer hee hath but once imagined: if this I say, bee true, (which God forbid in so great a Church-man) now surely he is not the fittest Iudge to be resorted vnto in cases of conscience, especially of such nature and consequence as this in Temp. Henr. 7. hand. Wherein (as a learned Poet once merrily said, there stands Latro at the barre, and Fur sits on the bench) himselfe becomes both partie and Iudge. When Popes alleage Popes for proofe of their Supremacie, the Canonists say it is Familia is probatio: certainely this must needes bee a more familiar proofe, when reference is made to the Pope in his owne cause.
            53 For the knot of the quarrell betweene these differing Catholikes, if there were any concerning the OATH, and that which vexeth them most, was the point of the Popes authoritie in deposing Princes, and absoluing from the OATH; for, so farre as touched Ciuill Obedience, THAT stuck not with them, they say. Heere is the Pope become a partie. Who now must vnloose this knot, and determine the quarrell? None but the Pope. If I should beare witnesse 
               Ioh. 5. 32. 
               of MY SELFE, saith our Sauiour Christ, MY witnesse were not true:  yea, but saith this Iesuite,
                the Pope being Pag. 10. no. 15. the supreame Pastor, to him, by the principles of their Religion, Catholikes beleeue that our Sauiour giueth assistance for the direction of mens souls. Heres the Pope made a Iudge. Certes, had he determined negatiuely against himselfe, he had beene to blame, at least his authoritie for euer after, might haue beene encountered with Serue nequam 
               Luk. 19. 22.

And if the Pope, in whose alone determination the Catholikes must rest, would giue any arguments of Resolution against his owne challenge, if it had not beene ridiculous, sure it had beene miraculous. The Apologue is knowen, if the Lion may bee Iudge in the diuision of the prey, his fellow-hunters shall Aesop. haue but a small share: and Kings shall bee sure auguste sedere, (as Tully said to Caesar) haue both strait limits and vnquiet Ma

                  o. Sat. 2. seates, if the Pope may determine their Bounds and States.
            
            54 But let Fa. Parsons say in sooth (if there can bee any sooth in a man of such singular honestie as the Priests describe him, intituling him an impostume of all corruptions) 
               Quod lib. p. 237 was there any such reference made out of England vnto the Pope for his Resolution? Was it by Petition written, or by Message of mouth deliuered? Let him shew the State of the Question, as it was framed; put downe the arguments of the difference, to and fro, as they were obiected; and make knowea the reason of the Popes negatiue decision: this were plaine dealing in him, and had beene faire dealing in the Pope, if, before hee had sent his Breues of Interdiction, he had acquainted his Maiestic with the encounters of doubt that had bred the quarrell, and the ouerswaying reason which carried him to the Negatiue. This being omitted, his Maiestie gaue his decision the right name, when he called it a malitious trucke of the Diuell.
            
            55 For there was both malice in the Sentence, because done of purpose, and not out of passion, but after due deliberation, 
               Numb. 15. (saith this Epistler) and that is malice in any sin, as the Schoole-men define it: Secondly, in the intent there Aquinas. 12ae. q. 47. & 78. was extreme malice, thereby to foster in his Maiesties heart iealousie of his Subiects; and in them disloyaltie to their Soueraigne: and all this, which is truth indeed, vpon

the onely information, aduice, and instigation of a knowen Incendiarie, Parsons; who euer since hee ran out of his Countrey, like traiterous Absolon, cares not to set his owne friends Land, yea to see his natiue soile on a light 2. Sam 14. 30. fire, so he may purchase the Popes fauour, as the other did Ioabs corne, to approch his fathers presence. Thirdly, malice in the whole action, busily interposing himselfe in other States which concerne him nothing (for that is noted as a great part of the Diuels malice, that he is Magnus ille Peripateticus, and takes vpon him to bee the generall Iob 1. Surueyer and Compasser of the whole earth.) For what hath the Bishop of Rome to doe with the King and Subiects of England in matters of Religion? Much lesse of State: especially seeing hee medleth not for good, but for euill, (cuen as that other vniuersall Rector in the aire, quaerens quem deuoret) not instructing, but interdicting? 1. Pet. 5. 8.
            
            56 Wee say with the Fathers in the Councell of Carthage, when they tooke the Bishop of Rome his Aduocates cardie, and falsaries in his challenge for the cognisance of all Ecclesiasticall differences to belong to HIM: Aliae Ecclesiae habent Spiritum Sanctum, vt causas cognoscere & dijudicare 
               Concil. Cartha. 6. 
               possint. Nay (saith this Censurer)
                the Pope only hath, Numb, 20 supposing as we doe in matters Catholike, concerning persons Catholike, that England is the Popes haruest, and the Catholikes therein, his flocke; the diuision of the Island by Sea not making any separation from him their generall Head for dependance.
            
            57 This is a strong Argument, no doubt; the Pope hath to doe in England, because some Catholikes SVPPOSE he hath: but before that SVPPOSALL bee brought into a positiue and resolute Conclusion, it will aske a longer time then such a Pamphlet as his Letter is will require; and more deepe diuinitie then Parsons hath, if it be true which the Priests report of him, that hee is neither acute Schoole-man, nor profound diuine, but a meane Preacher, and a barren Ghostly Counseller. 
               Quodiib. page 237.
            
            
               
58 For whether Saint Peter be made Terminus â quo, or ad quem, either to deriue the vniuersalitie from him to the Pope, or reduce it from the Pope to him, many a knottre question is to be decided: as first, Whether the Gouernment of the Church should be Monarchicall? Whether that Monarch should be Saint Peter, as superiour to the rest of the Apostles? Whether the Charge of the Keyes were giuen to him, alone? Howfarre the Iurisdiction of the Keyes will reach? Whether feed my Sheepe and Lambes bee an vniuersall charge, and to Peter alone? If all this true; how comes it to the Bishop of Rome, rather then an other? Whether Peter appointed him his Successor? Whether he hath it Iure diuino, or Ecclesiastico? Whether that same one Pastor & one slocke bee not proper to Christ alone? Why not an vniuersall Emperor as well as an vniuersall Pope? with many other such, which would trouble a better Clarke then this Iesuite, euen to discusse: sor hot braines as they vndertake matters busilie, so they performe nothing soundly or indiciously.
            59 If other states and Nations brooke the Pope for their Iudge (and yet in most of them which hee names, they doe but Quatenus) it is either their voluntary submission, not his iust claime; or else his violent vsurpation forced on them by terror, not their spirituall subiection, warranted by diuinitie. And therefore it argued some ingenuitie in the man, that hee made it but a SVPPOSALL. For if all the rest of the Apostles were not Ordered Bishops by Saint Peter, (saith Bellarmine) then

Anal. fid. li. 7. cip, 2. doe indeed make it but a SVPPOSALL; the most fauourable of them, that it is but Likely; an other, that it is vncertaine; but others, that it is scarce probable: yea, that it is an opinion, neither generally receiued, norgreatly necessarie.
            
            60 A fourth tricke of Malice, mixt with Craft, (two

properties of the enuious man, that sowed tares in sleeping time) was the Popes Riddle, rather then answer, in not particularizing Mat. 13. 25. the specialties to be excepted in the OATH: his Craft, lest straining at that point which touched his authoritic in deposing and absoluing, hee should reueale his partialitie; for so, as Demetrius the Ephesian, his clamorous Act. 19. 24. plea for his Diana, in respect of his priuate gaine, and credit of the Citie, or rather of the See, would haue beene too manifest. His Malice, closely insinuating the whole OATH to be vtterly vnlawfull, euen that very point of swearing Ciuill obedience; for so he saith, Such an Oath cannot be taken (this minsing distinguisher puts in [as it lay] without annoyance of the Catholike faith. All this the Censurer repeateth, but refelleth not. Num. 19.
            61 And this was his Maiesties iust agreeuance; that how soeuer in matter of Religion the Pope would meddle; yet in things that meerely and onely concerne Ciuill obedience, that he should interpose himselfe, could not but argue him to be Curiosus in aliena Republica, a busie Polypragmō
                where he had nothing to doe; which this Iesuite confesseth to be a iust mislike if it proue true.
            
            62 Now then this must be cleared, whether the OATH doth onely concerne Ciuill Obedience, yea or no? That it doth not, hee takes vpon him to satissie in eight Numbers; from the 20. to the 28. and that foure seuerall waies, as he saith; 
                  First, Out of the words of the OATH, wherein 1 the Popes authoritie is limited (indeed this is it which startles them;) Secondly, Out of the Popes words marshalling 2 the taking of the Oath, thus mixed with clauses concerning Religion, with repairing to our Church assemblies, arguing that he forbade the OATH so farre as it was an Act Spirituall. Thirdly, Out of the Cardinals Letter, who after Consultation with others, (scil. with a Traitor 3 called Parsons) doth therein include the OATH to bee vnlawfull because it is compounded by ioyning of spirituall and Temporall things together, as Iulian his Picture, with
the Images of the Paynim Gods.

            63 (This Bellarmine dooth in cold blood, as he is Ro bertus Cardinalis, couertly resembling his Maiestie to that Apostata; but when hee is by his Metamorphosis, or Metonomasie translated into Mathaeus Tortus, that is a Publican vexed, either with wrath or fury, or malice, or all, then hee particularizeth the comparison, and makes his Maiestie no better, yea worse then Iulian.)
            
            64 Fourthly, 
                  by are all offer on the Catholike part; the 
                  4 former whereof hee drawes and diuides, First affirmatiue two waies, viz. That so much of the OATH as concerneth Ciuill obedience, euery Catholike shall take (marry with a restraint two-fold) as much as any Catholike hath done in time of Popery, or any Forreine Subiect doth to a Popish Prince. Secondly, Concerning the Pope, this Catholike shall sweare, that hee hopes, that his Holines will doe nothing in preiudice of his Maiestie, yea, hee will labour to stay him if hee doe, and will pray for them both: the other part is negatiue; that the Catholikes shall not touch any part of the OATH which seemeth to impeach the Popes Authoritie; therefore that more is required then Ciuill Obedience, by this it is euident. By what? because the Pope deciares so; & the Cardinall writes so, & this Iesuit saies so?
            65 But wee laying this for our ground, first, that both swearing and performing Ciuill Obedience is aswell negatiue, against any intruder, Challenger, or Vsurper; as affirmatiue, for the lawfull Gouernors and Soueraignes: Secondly, that this challenge of the Pope in dethroning and deposing Princes, is a temporall intrusion, and no spirituall Iurisdiction, doe conclude with as strong and apparant euidence, that the whole bulke of the OATH, both in the submissiue and exclusiue part, doth onely concerne Ciuill obedience. Of the first ground there is no doubt; for Art thou on our side, or on our aduersaries? was a proper and fit question mooued by a resolute Gouernour: luke-warm 
               Iosh. 5. 13. Subiects being as odious and dangerous in a State Politike, Apoc 3. 16.
               
as such professors are in Religious Societies, iustly to bee vomited out of the Realme, as Solon his 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , and Plut. Sol n. Neutralls from his common-wealth. Of the second, wee make as little doubt; the proofes thereof, by so many that haue debated that controuersie, are so plentifull, so pregnant and impregnable: but seeing we meane this Iesuite a fauour, wee will remit him to T. M. the elder (hee D. Mort
                     •…
                  bis full satisfact. part. 3. had as leefe goe to the Racke) who, among many other, hath canuassed this point, in a Confutation, to the Popes confusion.
            66 For this authoritie of the Pope, if it bee a spirituall Iurisdiction, it must bee either from heauen or of men, grounded vpon law either Diuine or Ecclesiasticall: Nam 
               Bern. ad Eug
                     •…
                  . 
               quod amplius est, à malo est, saith a deuout Father to a great Pope: All execution thereof, not deriued from either of these, implies a tyranny, imports no right. If vpon Diuine Law, then either the Old or the New Testament; not the Old, the Priests among the Iewes had no such authoritie ouer their Kings, either vnited to their Priest-hood by God, or assumed by themselues; confessed so by a Iesuite, that the state Salmer, in Epist. Pauli, disp. 12. of the Iewes was rather earthly then heauenly: therefore the carnall part was more eminent, that is, Kings had the Souereigntie ouer the Priests.
            
            67 Not in the New: for then S. Peter should haue had it, either when the Keyes were giuen him, Matt. 16. or when that trebled Pasce was inioined him, Ioh. 21. If it bee so, then had he this Iurisdiction directly from Christ, and vniuersally ouer the world: but that is not so, saith Robert the Cardinall, and this Robert his Eccho, but only ouer Bellar. lib. 5. de Pontis. Rom. cap. 4 &. 6. Christian Princes, and that indirectly and obliquely, in Ordine ad Deum. Nay, neither directly nor indirectly, saith Saunders; for there being a double power of Christian De claue, lib. 2. cap. 13. fortitude, constant suffering, and couragious attempting, that power of suffering (as the more excellent) Christ chose, as the fittest sibi & suis, for himselfe and those that belong to him; or, if you will, for himselfe and his Apostles.
               
So, then to suffer oppression vnder Kings, not to inferre vpon them Rebellion and Disloyaltie, was the power Apostolicall in respect of Princes.
            68 By Law Diuine then it was excluded; for no man can transferre that to another, which hee hath not himselfe; but this royall Soueraigntie ouer Princes, to depose them, or dispose of their States, Christ had not as hee was man (and yet he said Omnis potest as data est mihi in Coelo & in Terra) 
               Math. 28. 18. yea such power had beene vnprofitable and superf

                  uous (saith Vbi supra. the Grand Cardinall) therefore hee could not transferre it to Saint Peter, or the rest.
            69 For Ecclesiasticall Law; no Canon, Councell, Decree, Practise extant, reckon to 600. yeeres after Christ, by Bellarmines

And that Act of Hildebrand, that famously infamous Pope, who first tooke vpon him to depriue an Emperour of his regiment, is by a Popish Deuine called Nouellum Schisma, a rent, & a rent 
               Clau. Espencaeus in Tim. Digres. li. 2. cap. 6. 
               of Noueltie: the challenge of this authoritie vtterlie vnknowen to the Fathers, who haue pronounced Kings to be no way liable to any violent Censure, or penall Law of man, tuti imperii potestate, their Empire and Soueraigntie exempting Ambros. Apolog. Dauid. cap. 4. &. 10. and priueledging them therefrom.
            70 Therefore this authoritie of the Pope, thus proclaimed by himselfe, thus patronized by the Iesuites, being meerely temporall, neither Scripture, Father, Councell, or Practise, for so many yeeres, warranting it, and by consequent, an humane Inuention and Intrusion, presumptuous in the Pope against a Ciuill Magistrate (which is Gods Ordinance) and preiudiciall to Kings in disquieting their states, and disparaging their Souereignties: the matter of the Rom. 13. whole OATH both submissiue for affirmatiue allegeance, and exclusiue for negatiue acceptance of forraine disturbers, must needs be meerely Ciuill and Temporall; and the whole

OATH to be as intirely taken of English Subiects for their King and Soueraigne against the Pope, claiming and vsurping part of his right, as well as that of Iehoiada by the men of Iuda for Ioaz their King, against Athalia that vsurped 2. Reg. 11. 4. his state.
            71 Neither doth that point of the OATH more concerne Religion, then if any other Prince, Christian or Heathen, should haue beene put in the same, and the Pope lest out. For this authoritie of the Pope, so excluded in the OATH, must bee as he is either a Temporall Prince, (and then the OATH is meerely Ciuill) or else as he is a spirituall Iudge; which, if it be a point of true Religion, must haue the warrant in Scriptures, and by the donation of the Keyes 
               Matth. 16. if in any Scripture.
            
            72 T'is so, saith Saunders: for S. Peter with THEM, Vbi supra c. 10. receiued both Powers, Temporall and Ciuill, to build and destroy Uictoria, Rel. 1. Sect. 2. 
               Kingdomes. Not so, saith a Iesuite, for this power of the Keies, est alia á Ciuili Potestate. Thus they iarre. Meane while, wee are sure that this is a Precept in true Religion, Rom. 13. 
               Euery soule to be subiect to the higher powers. But if there bee a Religion, such as hee cals Catholike, which exempts any when the Apostle includes all, I say no more but that which our Sauiour said to the Pharisees, Hypocritae, 
               Mat. 15. 6. 
               irritum fecistis mandatum Dei propter Traditionem vestram. and that which hee said of them when they were offended at that speech, Euery plant which my heauenly Father hath not 
               Verse. 14. 
               planted, shall be rooted out. And perhaps this rufling of the Pope with his BREVES against his Maiestie, argues as wel for him, as it did for an other Rufler elsewhere, that he hath great wrath, Sciens quod BREVE tempus habet, knowing his Apoc. 12. 12. time is but a BREVE.
            73 Now we proceed to remoue two blocks at which this Iesuite stumbles, but hee goes backe to fetch them, for this fellow treads the Maze; hee was euen now at the 6. and now he is come to the 4. page, wherein hee takes two exceptions against his Maiestie: first, in that it is said

               Many Popishly affected of both sorts did freely take this OATH. Secondly, that their so taking of it is called a blessed successe of so good adeuice and intent in proposing such an OATH. In the first, the Assertion hee denies not, that many did so; but he sticks at the Aduerbe FREELY. God loues Aduerbes, say the Canonists, the Diuell doth not; for, that the Aduerbe doth make the action commendable, yea, denominate the action, is an Axiome both in Diuine and Humane learning. Now, lost this action of theirs should be commended too much, he first descants vpon the word FREELY, and disprooues it 
                  by the Statute penaltie, and a distinction of Philosophie: for the statute inflicting vpon the refuser so strait a punishment, Aristotle in his Ethicks, and Thomas in his Summe, are so farre from accounting it a FREE action, that the Schoole-men determine it to bee Inuoluntarium secundum quid; and the Philosopher Inuoluntarium simpliciter: much like the instance which Aristotle giues, and the owner of the ship (wherein S. Paul was a passenger) felt, the throwing of all the fraught into the Sea to sauemens liues: whereunto 
                  Act. 27. 
                  this case is semblable either for me to take the OATH, which is against Conscience; or indure a strict penaltie, which cannot be FREEDOME: for that FREEDOME (saith hee) requireth liberties, that is FREEDOME to both extremes or obiects. And heere, as if with Aesops hen hee had laid a golden egge, hee cackles out a Triumph: Let the discreet Reader (saith he) consider what coherence there is in this tale; namely, that there should be a penaltie vpon the Refuser, and yet the taking of the OATH to be called a FREEDOME.
               
            
            74. And is there then such an 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                and disagreement, betweene the peine of a Statute-Law, and the will of a Subiect, that he which obeies the Law so inioyning, shall not bee accounted a Free-subiect for his Obedience? then are all the people of the Christned world Slaues, not Freemen. For what Nation is there gouerned by Lawes, not

enioyned by sharpe penalties? Were all Subiects Saint Pauls true Schollers, and would obey their Superiours for Conscience sake, all Penalties were then vnnecessarie restraints; or were all Princes Draco-like, who hauing such Subiects, would write each law in blood, such penall Lawes were Tyrannicall inforcements: but the subiects of the best Princes being of diuers dispositions, some willingly submitting themselues to the streitest Lawes, not for feare of the punishmēt, but for conscience to God, and dutie to their Souereigne: others refractarie, whose mouthes must bee holden with bit and bridle, because without a penall constraint they will wax wilde, and yeeld no obedience: therefore in the best mannaged States, are all, or the most Lawes back't with penalties, and yet the Subiects libertie no way infringed. It is Licence, not Libertie that admits no penaltie. The Law of God it selfe is imposed with penalties, and yet mans Obedience yeelded thereunto, is not Thraldome but Freedome; which made the Apostle say, That the Law was not giuen vnto the righteous man; for his direction, 
               1. Tim. 1. 9. Gal. 3. 23. no doubt it was, it is our Schoolemaster vnto Christ; but not for his terror, because his willingnes preuents the Constraint, and his obedience the Censure. But to the Wicked and rebellious it is giuen, not thereby abridging their Freedome, but punishing their contempt.
            
            75 Were the Statute inforced peremptorily and no leasure granted for deliberation, or after deliberation no libertie of choice, but inforst vpon them to take it whether they will or no: then might the OATH be accounted a pressure, and the acceptance thereof a slauerie. But first, time being giuen to consider thereof: and after consideration, leaue granted to choose or refuse, this in their owne schoole-learning is True & Full Libertie: for to it they annex these two conditions. 1. indeterminationem Iudicij ad deliberandum, 
               Medina in primam 
                     〈◊〉
                  . quest. 6 art. 2. an vnlimited scope for the iudgement to deliberate. 2. facultatem eligendi vel refutandi quod deliberandū est, power either to choose or resuse what is deliberated. The first is

               Radix Libertatis, the sourse or fountaine of Libertie; the other is ipsa Libertas, Freedome it selfe, saith Medina. And that's the very case betweene the King and his subiects in this matter of the OATH; so that the very refusall (after deliberation) argues, that, either to take it or no, they had libertie of choice; but in refusing it, no loyaltie of affection.
            76 But what if by the word Freely, his Maiestie meant either a voluntarie offer of some, who to shew their loyaltie to their Soueraigne, of themselues desired to take the OATH; or, being required, after view thereof, without either respecting the penaltie, or doubting of the Lawfullnesse, Readily yeelded that pledge of their allegeance, by taking the OATH? Then let the discreet Reader, (to whom he appeales) consider what a trifling Sophister this is, to picke quarels at words, by wrests and streines neither to purpose nor to sense: for that his Maiesties meaning was so by the Latine translation, is manifest; where these words Many FREELY tooke the OATH, are there translated Permulti Sacramento se obstringere non DVBITARVNT, Apolog. lat. pag. 4. lin. 6. that is, they stuck not at it, but without terror or doubt took it. And this the Make-bate knew well-inough, but that he would perhaps take a small occasion to vindicate his credit (which the Priests haue somewhat impayred, by assuring the world, that he is no Scoole-Diuine) by shewing his skill in Aquine and in a peece of Aristotle, which euery Puny hath by rore.
            77 Secondly, lest this their acceptance of the OATH should be too much commended, hee takes vpon him to interpret their meaning; wherein let the Reader consider what an Hypocrite hee is: for it is an inseparable marke of an Hipocrite, to iudge of other mens consciences. The Mat. 7. heart of man is Gods peculiar: for any man to place his Consistory there, is an high presumption; and therefore when some haue taken the OATH, and sweare they doe it heartely, wee say with Nazian.

diue into their conceits, and to iudge with what affection (either of feare of punishment; or hope of fauour; or loue to their Prince) they do it, it is not our purpose, nor comes it within our reach: and yet this Serpens Epidaurius can see more in them, then their selues will acknowledge; and Horace. though they sweare they doe it willingly, yet hee can assure both them and vs, that they doe it by constraint.
            
            78 Et nunquid Saul inter Prophetas? yea surely, for hee can prophecie, that though they sweare they doe it heartily, 
               1. Sam. 10. 11. and without any mentall euasion, yet hee is perswaded, and would perswade vs, that they do it neither Freely, that is Willingly, without feare of Coertion; nor Freely, that is plainely, but with a reserued distinction. And now againe, let the Reader, (whose helpe he craues) behold a malitious tricke of a notable Aequiuocator, that cannot be contented to be himselfe alone (for doubling and dissembling) the Diuels Scholler (that ancient Aequiuocator, that can be the Prince of darknesse, and an Angell of light all at once) but must also bee his Diuilitie Reader or Schoole-man, to teach 2. Cor. 11. others to distinguish themselues to Hell fire, and that is, Num. 30. Wherein he shewes himselfe to be, verè Spiritus mendaex in ore Prophetarum, framing two distinctions like the two hornes of Sedechias (such another as himselfe, full 1. Reg. 22. 22. of that spirit) and putting them into their mouthes: the first, that the Popehath not authority without Iust cause, to proceed against Princes: the second, that the Pope hath not his authority directly, but indirectly, & in ordine ad spiritualia, and for the Catholike cause: Et in his ventilabis Syriam, 
               vers. 11. saith the false Prophet, of his hornes: and with these distinctions, saith this Iesuite, the OATH-taking may satisfie the Statute, and reserue integritie and sincerity of true Catholike doctrine.
            
            79 As if hee should say, though they swore (as it is in the OATH) that they beleeue, and in conscience are resolued that the Pope hath no authoritie vpon his excommunicating of Princes, to absolue Subiects from their Obedience;
               
and that they swore this according to the expresse words by them spoken, and according to the plaine and common sense and vnderstanding of the same words, without any Aequiuocation, or mentall euasion, or secret reseration whatsoeuer, (all which are the words of the OATH:) yet if in their minde they shall secret
                  •…
               y conceiue these two distinctions, 
                  No authoritie without IVST CAVSE, or not DIRECTLY: though the Pope shall after hee hath excommunicated a Prince, absolue his Subiects, they must perswade themselues notwithstanding, that they haue sworne truely; and yet that the Pope hath done that, which in their consciences is iust; in that his so proceeding is either vpon iust Cause, or by his indirect authoritie.
            
            80 And now let a Christian Reader (that makes conscience either of God, or common honestie) consider whether these be not profunda Satanae in the Reuelation, euen the very mist and mistery of miquity; wherein hee may Apoc. 24. demand of this Iesuite, first whether this be not a Paganish delusion both of God and men! the very same of Lysander and Dyonisius, that Children are to bee mok't with toyes, and men with Oathes! Nay more then heathenish; for Aristotle

                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                to sweare with a mentall addition) hath neither feare of Gods vengeance, nor shame of mens reproofe. Secondly, if the OATH may by such distinctions, R

Ca. 18. according to the true Catholike Religion (for so this Censurer saith) be interpreted and expounded, why did not the Pope by his Breues, rather ratifie these as lawfull euasions, then at the first dash thunder out his awfull Interdictions? Thirdly, if the OATH bee so thin a Cob-web, that two such Flies may so easily breake through it; why doth this Iesuite so often tearme it a pressure of Conscience, forcing men to dispaire? Lastly hee might aske of this banished Catholike, whether that part of the OATH, touching the Popes authoritie, vpon which hee thus mentally didistinguisheth,

                  no sorte of Aequiuocation (saith Fa. Persons) is lawfull in matters of Faith and Religion. Yes (saith Fa. Parsons) their so Aequiuocating in this matter of faith, is lawfull, and may stand 
                  Num 14. Num 30. 
                  with the integritie and sinceritie of true Catholike doctrine.
                So then in matters of Faith and Religion it is not lawfull in any sort to Aequiuocate; but in this matter, though it concerne Faith and Religion, it is lawfull. Will not the discre

Vnlesse these distinctions may be admitted, hee that sweares honestly, and takes the OATH simply as it lyeth, and is meant by the Magistrate that offers it (namely that the Pope hath no authoritie vpon what occasion so euer, for neuer so much good of Christian Religion to proceede against any Prince, either by himselfe, or by permission of other Princes to doe the same) doth contradict the consent of all Catholike Diuines, and professeth that Gods prouidence is defectuous in care of his Church.

            95 How holds this together? He told vs before, that it was the Scruple of Conscience, which caused them to seeke Num. 15. beyond the Seas, both to enquire of the learned there, and to consult with the Pope: now he tels vs that this scruple is an effect engendred in them, by the resolution of those Learned, and the peremptorie Sentence of their Pastor. Et pergit vobiscum Papa perplexe loqui! Doth the Pope breed scruples in their mindes which consult him? He hath Priuilegium infirmitat is saith Canus) and cannot erre; therefore his resolution should remooue all doubts, cause none; should settle the conscience, not startle it.
            96 But take it either way, either as a cause moouing, or an effect succeeding; it bewraies in both a singular disloyaltie in the affection. Did the scruple cause the enquiry and consultation? That argued alienated dispositions; for true loue obeies, disputes not; yeeldes, and doubts not.

               y subornations; prey for him they may; iudge of him they may not; obey

him they must. Now this reliance vnrepealable (though he call it in the Catholikes, a scruple of Conscience) yet is it not in them, thus tied, a vassalage of slauery? and in the Pope, thus binding them (looke to himselfe) an oultrecuidance of Tyrannie? and, in respect of Kings, a licence for disloyaltie in their Subiectes, and the Allumettes of Treason to their persons? For what greater slauerie, then if Popes carie troupes to hell, yet men must follow them, and not argue with them? So saith Boniface the Archbishop of Mentz: and Boniface. apud Grat. d, 40. what more dreadfull instabilitie to Kings, then to enact Lawes for their Subiects, to trie and tie their Alleageance, and a forren Countermand must bee sent to free them, and affright them from Obedience?
            
            100 A second stay, which holds him so long in this Preface (he cals it the third point) is that speech in the Apologie, that it argued Gods blessing vpon the deuised OATH, that so many Popishly affected, did take the OATH: This he trips at, and giues his reason, That if it be a blessing, it must be so; first, to the takers, which are of two sorts, either in act, which are sworn already; or in desire, which wish they might, but dare not. The first haue no outward blessing of Libertie, for they are still imprisoned; if inward blessing of Comfort, hee knowes not: but to the other, it is the greatest pressure of Conscience, and angaration of minde, that euer befell them; for that oppression exceeds all other, either Corporall for paines, or worldly for losse.
            
            101 Indeed the the trouble of Conscience is a fearefull vexation: but the next that comes to it (because it is a mentall worke) is the trouble in answering a Cauelling Sophister; who hauing some remnants of common-places, wherein he is perfect (like one ready to be drowned, that laies hold of any thing, though a rush or stick) snatcheth at words, to giue vent to his notes, neither well couched, nor properly applyed.

            104 Now God hauing blessed his Maiestie with an accrument of a great and mightie Nation; but finding with all, that rule in Vegetius to be true, that it is not numerus but virtus, not multitude but Loialtie, which in time of exi gence must preuaile; to assure himselfe that his Subiects, will be neither filij Ephraim a saint-hearted people, with their bowes bent, ready to turne their backs vpon him, Psal. 78. 9. faile him at his most neede; nor filij Belial, a false-hearted people, either vilifying his person (as some did Sauls at 1. Saui. 10. 27.
               
his first entrance) or turning their weapons against him, as Dauid was serued, both by the sonne of his loynes, and 2. Sam, 15. 12. his great Councellor of State; the rather hauing beene already in Dauids Case, affrighted with the bloody hands of strange Children, whose mouth talked of Vanitie, and their right hand was the right hand of iniquitie. He deuised this OATH Psal 144. for a pledge of his assurance, for abond of their allegeance, which accordingly succeeded; because what he hoped, hapned; yea, more then he expected. For many vnrequired, came and shewed themselues to be Populus voluntarius, FREELY offering to take the OATH; and this the King truely calleth a BLESSING of God vpon the deuise.

            108 Secondly, if pressure of conscience may serue for good Plea of Recusancie to Princes Lawes, there is nether malefacton for crime, nor Hereticke for schisme (neuer so great) but will make that his Apologie against any Censure. The making of Lawes, and the execution thereof, must depend vpon the Magistrates will directed by Gods word, not vpon other mens Consciences, whether tender as vnresolued, or pecuish, as neuer satisfied.

Paul) because the veile is not remooued from Moses face? or that the Law is still Typicall? Nay, that is gone, but the veile is now spread, by their owne wilfulnesse, ouer their owne hearts. Such is the Conscience of those Catholikes whom he bemoaneth; who either led by their owne conceit (obstinate by some former impression) or misled, what with future hopes buzzed into their eares, or by present terrors of Churches Censure, or relying vpon the Pope, as the Iewes vpon Moses (though these last haue the better warrant) doe name that to be Conscience, which is but Error; and angariation of spirit, which is nought else but peeuishnesse. The issue, either of superstitious feare, or malignant opposition, or slauish dependance, for to be greeued with that which is good, is not weakenesse, but wickednesse.

plead Conscience, the Magistrate indeuours to informe him, and rectifie it: if then hee refuse, the penaltie ensueth; which, he that knowes what Conscience is indeed, will rather indure (though to the losse of life) then venture vpon the checke of that in-dwelling and vpbraiding witnesse. it argues they haue but a Leprous Conscience (as his Matestie

This he is guilty of, and therefore by an anticipating Concession he grants it true, but preuents an Obiection, which we might, and haue oft iustly made; that if they by their (more then Hellish) Tortures, force men (as they doe) both innocent and ignorant (euen against the Law of Nations) Trauellers, Merchants, strangers, to renounce and abiure the perswasion of their Faith; Much more may our Souereigne, by OATH, inforce (vnder penalty) his natiue Subiects, to abiure the Popes Temporall authority in deposing Kings.
            
            123. To which he maketh answer, both negatiue, and vntrue: negatiue, that they inforce none to sweare, if they suppose they doe it with repugnance of Conscience: (no more doe we; for if any be required, and take the OATH, wee

accept it: if heresuse, we presse him not: if he sweare, he doth it willingly, (and the words of the OATH are so) wee iudge not the heart: the ouert-act and the word vttered is the vtmost that mans iudgement can reach vnto.)

In which kinde, Rome (both Heathen and Popish) hath beene noted most exquisite. If, thus tormented, hee renege and denie his profession, can the Inquisitors be perswaded he doth it without reluctance of Conscience? But if, thus mangled, he resist (as the Apostle speaketh) ad Cruorem, euen to Blood, Heb. 12. 4.

His principall reason, for affirming, is, because the Catholike Church hath Ius acquisitum, an ancient right ouer Heretikes, in that they were baptized into her, and after left her.

It is an excellent libertie, to encounter an aduersarie neuer extant, and to argue vpon Conclusions neuer granted: he takes it pro concesso, that the Church of Rome is the Catholike Church; which wee denie; and the chiefest learned on their side, as yet, could neuer euict our deniall: for whether they take Catholike for Vniuersall, as containing all the members of Christs Church, militant and triumphant within it, Rome (being but a particular City, and the true Iurisdiction confined within a limited Diocesse or Prouince) cannot be it: or take Catholike for the profession of the true Faith (as S Cyprian, for that purpose, cals that Ep. 55. ad Cornel. of Africa, the Catholike Church) neither can the Romish Church be, in that respect, so intitled. For what was said

of the Church of the Iewes in her corrupt state, is too true of Rome: Her gold is mixed with drosse: and She, whose faith Esa. 1. 23. was plight to Christ, is become an Adulteresse.

            127. For that right which the true Catholike Church of Christ, and euery visible part thereof, within her compasse, respectiuely, hath against Heretikes, either for their conuersion or chastisement, is Ius innatum, bred within it, and vnseparable from it: for no sooner was there a Church designed, but this right was annexed: Semen Multeris conteret 
               Gen. 3. 
               Caput Serpentis: as the enmitie for contradiction, so the right for suppression, is natiue.
            128. If the challenge of Acquisition bee in respect of Baptisme (which is Allens claime, and this Page of his doth sooth him in it) as it is an iniurie to our Church, so is it a blasphemie against Christ. Neither the Spirituall Mystery, nor the prescribed forme, nor the intended effect of Baptisme, directing any way, or making vs in any thing liable to the Church of Rome. First, in Baptisme for the Mystery; there is an Indument and a stripping, which the ancient Church reduced to two words, Credo, Abrenuntio: in the first, there is the putting on of our Lord Iesus Christ: For as many as are

whereby they may be saued. Thirdly, as Christ, aswell their annointed King, submitting themselues to his will, giuing their names to his warres, and swearing themselues his Subiects: as also their annointed Priest, resting in his One Sacrifice, as the Onely sufficient. Heere's no mention of Romes Church. In the stripping part, they renounce and forsake the works of the Diuell and Flesh: and into that part, indeed, (if with Saint Paul) Heresies bee marshalled, Gal. 5. 20. 
               Rome (the nurse of them) is renounc'd in Baptisme.

And what makes all this to the Ius acquisitum of the Romish Church ouer thē that are Baptized? yea, though they were Baptized in the middest of Rome? vnlesse they can soundly prooue it to be the Onely, true, and vnerring Church; and that it neither hath swarued, nor doth adde to that faith and doctrine, which they that are truly Baptized are bound (by the Scriptures) to professe in Baptisme?
            
            131. Therefore wee, hauing as good cause to be perswaded of our Church, aswel in assurance of Gods promise, truth, and presence within it, as her iust right for suppressing Heresies, make no doubt, but that against them of Rome, we may as lawfully proceed, by compulsarie means, and by this OATH, as they against vs by the like.
            132. HEE denies it both by Reason and Example; Reason, because they had possession long before vs: Example,

Carthag. apud Cyrpi. true) to the OATH of Ciuill Allegeance? Doth it exact of them a renouncing of their Baptisme? or their opinions in Religion, concerning Faith and Doctrine?
            134. Yea, but there was neuer the like OATH heere, or elswhere exacted: If he meane for Temporall Allegeance in the submissiue part thereof, it is an vntruth; our Chronicles are full of Examples to that purpose; and there is no Christian Prince, but vpon occasion, inforceth the like vpon his Seruants and Subiects.

If in the Exclusiue part, for the abiuring of the Popes temporall right (whether directly or indirectly) ouer Kingdomes and Nations; if other Princes doe not the like, we iudge them not: perhaps it is in some of them an infused perswasion, that it is not lawfull; in others peraduenture it is a violent restraint, if gladly they would, but cannot be suffered.
            135. If with vs neuer the like before, (suppose hee say truly) first, looke to the Motiue; it was vpon an occasion (wee must repeat it, though it vex him) Singular from all Examples. Secondlie, the Pope was neuer so insolently busie with any Nation, nor his vassals so vnnaturally malitious with this Land heeretofore, as of late with Our Soueraignes and Kingdomes; which, but for him, our Gratious King might enioy with a Peace more continuall and happie then Solomon or Augustus. And so hauing done with his long Preface (which is like a flash of Lightning before a Thunder) wee now come to the Thunderbolt itselfe (as his

Maiestie well cals it) I meane the Breues (not Musicall, but

            136. For first, the other did it before hee changed his name: while Saul, he breathed his minaces against Christ: being Paul, he preached the faith of Christ, and Obedience to Princes. This man, while he was Burghesi, was in effect Paul, that is, (as the name signifieth) a still silent man; for ought we read of, he neuer breathed word for Christ: no Of

               against Christ: if not the Messiah, our Lord the anointed, yet against our King the Lords anointed. Secondly, the Apostle was but a Commissioner subordinate, vnder the High-Priests, for Gods truth (as he thought:) this High-priest (being the cheefe Commander himselfe) in his own name sentenceth, and for his owne sake pursueth, and in his owne claime, as he pretendeth. Saul, while he was striking, was Act 9. 4. stricken into his Conuersion, Faxit Paulo huic; yet it is folly to wish where there is no hope.

               2. SHE was a daughter of the blood roiall, borne to the Hos. 9. 11. Crowne (in the Prophets words, from the Birth, from the Wombe, from the Conception:) a Princesse aduanced to the Crowne in apparant right, and by vncontroleable succession: an Imperiall Monarch, wearing the Crown with most absolute command.

Bizarus. Mercur. Gallob. &c. time, and for her Sex, the Starre of Souereignty; the mirror of Principalitie; a terror where enmitie; the Load stone of Maiestie, drawing to HER Ambassadors Christian, not Christian only for enteruiew and Salutation; in truth, for view and admiration. For when they had satisfied themselues with her sight (and hardly could they bee satisfied) what Sabaes Queene once said of King Solomon, they all 1.

               4. For had SHE beene Royall in Blood Only (and that's a blessednesse to a Kingdome, when the Prince is the Sonne

                     . and Prudent she was, Etiam supra Sexum, saith Thuanus, and hee no Protestant: or had she been sagely Prudent, and not Religious, her directions had beene no better then Aristotles Politikes, paganish and prophane; for many heathenish Kings haue excelled in them: but so Religious shee was, that the way she made in this Land Ad Euangelium Regni, for the Gospell of the Kingdome, made her Realme to be accounted Regnum Euangelii the Kingdome of the Gospell: So Lib. 13. much saith Meteran, and more then that, and yet hee no English man: In breefe, had she beene Religious alone, and not indowed with others vertues, gracing her as a woman, furnishing her as a Queene, deuout shee might haue beene, but retired; her Counsellors Graue, but not at all directed, perhaps oft thwarted; her people many, but in peace vnarmed, in warre dishartned.
               5 Therefore, besides those two supporters, of a State, as Nazianz. 
                  Nazian. cals them, which were in her most absolute, Prudence and Fortitude; that for direction, this for defence or annoyance as occasion serued: her other graces of minde (either suting with her Sex, or fitting for an Empresse) were so visible, so eminent in her, so innumerable for the varietie, so, vnexpressible for the dignitie (saith Bizarus an Italian) that as Demosthenes once spake

               9 For her Reward in heauen; if restraints of libertie, and pursuites of malice for Gods truth, inflicted through Iealousie, and indured with singular patience; if a release from them vnexpected, followed with honours and blessings, neither interrupted by others, (whether Treasons or Inuasions) nor blemished by her selfe with vice Criminall or continued; if life shut vp after length of daies, and a full age, with a courage defying Death; with Praiers imploring mercy: with Faith assuring her Praiers; with testimonies witnessing her assurance; can bee preceding coniectures, or rather euidences of vnspeakable happinesse, wee may safely conclude, that SHE which passed through a Crowne of Thornes, (borne so constantly) to a Crowne of

                  Gold (worne so tryumphantly) hath now gotten the Third of glorie, to enioy for-euer-lasting.
               10 For can we thinke, that he which gaue her patience to be an humble Confessor; crowned her humilitie with honor, to bee a Royall Queene; Seconded her Honour with wisdome, to be a Carefull Gouernour; grounded her wisdome vpon religion, to bee a DEFENDER OF THE FAITH; adorned her Religion with incomparable graces, to bee an example of vertue for her owne to follow, and a Load-starre for other Nations to admire: that hee (I say) would leaue HER in the end, to bee a prey for Satan? Nay, rather, as hee shewed himselfe, at first, to bee her Father, chastising her in loue; and after that, her God in sanctifying her minde; and withall her King, in aduancing her Throane; so, much more to bee her Sauiour, to make her an inheritor with the Saints in Heauen.

                  Apolog. lat. pa. 18.) and also in solemne manner with harty affection, and vnseinealy; for that is Sacrificing in the Metaphor, both by diuine and humane learning.
               27 And surely, (as it was said of Caesar, that in renewing Pompey his decaied Statua, he had erected and established Plutar. his owne) his Maiestie in thus recording her praise, and freeing her (being dead) thus gratiously from imputed slanders, Exegit Monumentum sibi aere perennius, hath fastned in the hearts of the true English Subiects, an vnremooueable Horat.

               28 In which sense (for it was no other) his Maiestie might vse that borrowed phrase, (especially vttering it with a Deprecatory Parenthesis, as it were in modesty asking leaue for the passage thereof; secretly thereby insinuating, that otherwise it was that which (among the Rhetoricians (is called Audax Methaphora) His Maiestie, I say might better vse it then Parsons, who without blushing or straining courtesie, dedicates a printed Calendar (a lying Legend of his owne) to the Saints in Heauen; whom, as if Third part of his 3. Conuers. their bodies and soules were already there vnited, he calleth WIGHTS of such worthinesse: and as if they could Page. 4. literally read from Heauen to Earth (at least by reflection) he directs them from Page to Page in his Booke, that there they may read how they are iustled out and confronted Page 7. with English Martyrs.
               
               29 But how will this Censuring Aristarchus interpret that place of their new Conuert of Old-castle, who in that frapling discourse of his Italicall progresse, telleth, that hee Iustus Baron. Epist. sacr. li. 3. ep. 14. with his company being at Millan, among other speciall rare Monuments, which they went to see, they came at last ad pussims Ambrosa iunioris MANES? Will hee translate it in his scosfing fille, to the INFERN ALL GHOST or HOB-GOBLINS of that yoonger. Ambrose? (so that Changeling intitles Cardinall Borromaeus, whose tombe it was.) Be it so: then Cardinals belike may goe to Hell, and their tormented Ghosts may walke: but thus the Relator will thinke himselfe abused; for he there describes Borromee to be a man of admirable sanctitie while he liued, of more admirable grace after his death; for his MANES wrought miracles equiualent to all SAINTS. Will he turne it to the best sense for the holy memory or sacred monument of that Sainted Cardinall? Why then may not his Maiestie, speaking of a dead Princesse (so Religious and

                  Renowned) vse the same word for HER blessed memorie, which, like that precious Oile in the Gospell, not onely with Matth. 26. the fauour filled the whole house where it was powred, (this Land where she liued) but the whole world with the report thereof, wheresoeuer HER name is mentioned? Will he say that SHE was an Heretike, but the Cardinall a Catholike? That vents his malice, but withall confutes his scorne and ignorance; because thereby he confesseth that MANES may be vsed for the memorie of men departed, who neuer came in Hell; vnlesse he will reply, that Borromee was in Purgatorie, and all that while his Ghost walked. But, that hee might seeme with some reason to conclude HER in Hell, he saith, She walked not in the ancient waies to life, especiallie those of Mortification by Praier, Almes. deeds, Watchings, wearing haire-cloth, and the like.

                  Rom. 14. 4. Gal. 6. 5. Secondly, fasting with sower countenance, praier in open places, dole of Almes with proclamations, are ensignes of Hypocrytes, in our Sauiours iudgement: and how knowest Matth. 6. THOW, whether (her chamber being shut) she praied in secret? Yes, and in publicke too, seldome missing praiers once euery day in her Closset, neuer omitting the Sabbath; silent at the hearing, deuout in the pronouncing of them; enduring in others, neither absence from them, nor irreuerence at them. For her reliefe of the poore of all sorts, her Almosners allowance, and priuy purse, are more fit intelligencers then such Sycophants as Parsons.

Lawes made for heating and saying Masse, before that Bull came; which are Nihil ad Rombum; his Maiestie speaking of Lawes whose Peine was death, hee mentioneth an OATH which was but the reuiuall of the like made in the time of Henry the eight, HER worthy Father, and of some lawes backed with pecuniarie mulcts, or losse of office and preferment.
               36 And so, sleightly casting off that point, he leaues his Maiestie a while, and lets flie at the Lo. Cooke, who at the arraignment of Garnet, indignantly scorning that the High priest of Rome, should in a Breeue of his, call so great a Prince, (as QUEENE ELIZABETH was) MISERAM FOEMINAM, a miserable woman; by a description of misery, consisting of two Contraries, want of Comfort, and plentie of tribulation, shewes many reasons euident and demonstratiue, that shee, hauing abundance of ioy, and no touch of affliction, but blessed with all kinde of Felicities, could not be called Miserable: this the Censurer Num. 6. answers; first by a shifting euasion; secondly, by a false interpretation of Scripture, thirdly, a slaunderous imputation vpon the Holy Ghost himselfe.
               37 His euasion; that outward Felicities are world lings arguments, no necessary improouements of Gods blessing. Indeede, whether a man bee loued of God or no, by externall prosperitie, no man can certainely knowe saith King Salomon, nam vniuersa aequé eueniunt iusto ac impio. But, if not concluding demonstrations, yet at least, Eccles, 9. 2 let them be probable perswasions of Gods fauour, especially when some of them to her, were such, that the verie enemies themselues (like the Egiptian Sorcerers) haue beene forced to say; this is the finger of God. 
                  Exod, 8, 29.
               
               38 But why may not Temporall prosperitie, bee made an argument of Gods loue to QVEENE ELIZABETH and of her felicitie, as well as bee skored vp for one of the notes of the true Church, by their beau-Clarke Bellarmine? which hee doth (verie strongly no doubt) in gleaning De notis Eccl.

Hall the Iesuite (as you heard) reasons for the contrarie, reciting vnto Littleton for his comfort, certaine examples of Hereticks ouer-comming Catholikes in battle, and infidels ouerthrowing Christians. The truth is, they care not what they say, nor how they crosse each other, so they may serue the turne for the time in saying something.
               39 The Scripture peruerted; a part of the Psal. Where 
                  Psal. 244. 11. (saith he) the worldlings made that their argument, for to proue their felicitie, by their full Cellars; their fatte kine; their plentifull Cattle; their beautifull and prosperous Children; and make this their conclusion, Beatum dixerunt populum cui haec sunt, so reades the Vulgar,  they said Blessed are the people who haue these things: which is a manifest detortion; for it is the Prophets argument, as a great motiue in himselfe, to continue his acknowledgement of Gods blessing vnto him and his people: wherewith after hee had begunne the Psalme vnto the fourth verse, vpon present dangers he requests deliuerance from the fifth verse to the ninth, and redoubles the same request verse the eleuenth: from thence to the 15. verse he sheweth what would be the happy effects of that deliuerance which in three whole verses he doth fully particularize, and then concludes all with a double Epiphonema, Beatus populus cui haec sunt, beatus Populus cuius Iehoua Deus. So that what the Prophet makes a Religious ground of Exultation for Gods Praise, this Iesuite makes it the wordlings Insultation of their owne Iollity.

               42 The third, which is a slanderous imputation laid vpon the Holy-Ghost, is when hee saith, That the spirit of God scorneth at them which so argue; if hee meane of any place in that Psalme, hee dooth misreport the spirit of truth; the whole Psalme hath no such word; if else-where, hee should haue named the place. It is true that good men greeue, and oftentimes murmure, yea almost reuolt, to behold the wicked flourish, and fare so well. It was Iobs, it was Dauid Case. But first the Holy-Ghost comforts them, not by scorning at the prosperity of those men (t'is Psal. 37. & 73. his owne gift) but intimating that it is ioyned with many

slipperie vncertainties, and that the end thereof shall Psa 37. & 73. bee visible and apparant miseries.
               43 Secondly, the iust men themselues obserue, that those ful-fed creatures do mixe their prosperitie with blasphemies against God; so speakes Iob, They say vnto God depart 
                  Iob. 21. 14. 
                  from vs, and who is the Almightie that wee should serue him? So Dauid: They set their mouth against Heauen, and 
                  Psal. 73 9. 
                  say how doth God know? If QVEENE ELIZABETHS felicities had issued into such effects, then the more outwardly happie, the more vndoubtedly miserable: but shee blessing God in her selfe, and causing him so to bee, through her whole Realme and life, shee was beata cuius Iehoua Deus, and therefore shee was beata cui haec erant. But this is a small wrest, in comparison of many other violences offered by him and his to the Scriptures; which they vse as Procrustes serued his guests, hacking them off, Plus. Theseus or racking them out, to fit them to their turnes. For the point in hand, Saint Augustine shall conclude it: Beat us est 
                  Aug. de beata Vita. 
                  qui habet omnia quae vult, et nihil mali vult. Blessed is hee who hath all that hee desires, and desires nothing but what is good, & that was QVEENE ELIZABETIIS case.
               44 His second stitch against the cheefe Iustice, is, the description of miserie, as consisting of two contraries, COPIA & INOPIA, which, saith this profound and great-read-Scholler, Is a miserable one indeede, neuer heard of be fore; ridiculous in Philosophy, and absurd in Common sense

               47 And euen in Cases of Conscience; were they not those two Contraries, Plenty of good desires in Saint Paul to doe well, but want of abilitie to performe those desires that made him to crie out miser ego homo! why? because to will was present with him, there's his Copia; but he found Rom. 7. 24.

With QVEENE ELIZABETH it was not so, who liued and died a true Christian: if at the first assault of her sicknesse she was silent and solitarie, Phisicke will ascribe it to the nature of Melancholly diseases, whose Symptomes are (among some other) taciturnit as et Solitudo. And as Reason would interpret, that, as shee in peremptorily refusing her bed, did shew her princely resolution, Stantem mori; so Christian Charitie would inferre, THAT retired silence in her, (both actiue and passiue) to bee a withdrawing of her minde from her senses, for a more serious Meditation of her by-past life, and her future state; which shee herselfe also professed, being mooued by a D. of Phy sicke, to tell how shee spent her time in so long silence; I Meditate (quoth she) and yet those lasted not out: for as strength or disease weekened, and nature decaied, she both tooke her to her bed; and the last most Reuerend Arch bishop kneeling by her, and praying for her, shee laide her hand vpon his head, and gaue her Am

And after that, beeing in perfect vnderstanding, she had, & heard, and indured vehement praiers to be powred out for her, not far from her, vntill the last gaspe shee gaue.

It will then goe hard with many holy and good men, both in Scripture and other stories. Nunquam malè moritur, qui bene viuit, saith S. Augustine: For, is thine eye euill because mine is good? is a speech vttered in his person, who is able Matth 20. 15. to saue his seruants soules at the last gaspe, in the greatest distemperatures of their bodies, and distraction of their mindes by violent or silent diseases.
               58 Hee hath rowsed her in her Death-bed; now hee runnes backe 70. yeares, to towse her in her Cradle, and there barkes at her (what eare or heart can brooke it?) for a Bastard, so promulged by Statute; so adiudged by the Arch-Bishop; so reputed by her Father; First, were it so, and that vpon such as are so bred, there are branded, as Plutarch saith,

                   fitly ministred for Scorners to vpbraid; yet why a Iesuite, professing Diuinitie, should reckon it among her personall Infelicities, the Fathers of the Church would maruell; who thinke that it impeacheth neither right in Heauen, nor renowne on earth; Vndecunque homines nascuntur, saith S. Augustine, From what stocke soeuer Children doe proceede, if they follow not their parents vices, they must not beare the burden of the ignominy: So Chrisostom: So Hie-

               59 Secondly, whether it hinder, or cut off succession or aduancement, is a great question among their owne. Lawyers of both sorts; the rule being currant with the most of them, Non est impedienda dignitas eius qui nihil admisit. And it seems by Damasus a Pope that he accounted Priests sonnes to be lawfully begotten in marriage; or if they were reputed Bastards, yet neuerthelesse they were Grat. vbi supra. not vncapeable euen of the Popedome; and he reckons many such that had beene Popes, But this was not the case of that Royall descended Queene.
               
               60 For first, if that rule bee good, Fortes creantur fortibus, SHE shewed her selfe, by her Princely qualities, (had there beene no other euidence) especially by her magnanimitie and courage, to haue beene sprung, not only (as Plutarch speakes, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ) of noble Progenitors, 
                  Vbi supra. but to be a Kings, and no other but King Henries Daughter. For wheras those that are so mis-begotten, haue seruile base mindes, at least deiected spirits: 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , &c. Euripid. Hippolit. saith the Poet, the very memorie and mention of their wrong-birth, abates the courage, and inthrals the minde into a kinde of basenesse: So farre it was from HER, that her subiects saw, and her foes felt, that shee had the most vndaunted and vn-yeelding Spirit, euen in the greatest troubles that could betide the State.
               61 Secondly when Sanders and Rishton, with others, had in print aspersed her birth with like staine and obloquie, and some had vnder-taken by discourse of Arguments, (plaine and vnanswerable, in a iust volume compiled

and printed) to cleere those base and disgracefull slanders, shee so farre scorned to haue her Birth-right questioned, that with great indignation shee caused them to bee suppressed at the presse.
               62 Thirdly, grant it, that by her Father and that Statute (which this Epistler heere mentioneth) shee were so pronounced. First, did not the same Parent and Statute also disgrace their Catholike Persecuting Queene Mary her Sister as much? & yet in all the Popish Writers she is highly extolled, and not once touched heerewith. Secondly, Misteries of State, and Secrets of Kings actions, are not to be narrowly pried into, and sifted by their Subiects, much lesse by Iesuites to bee censured. Princes are Men, and Parlaments are assemblies of Men; and Men (as the Philosopher said to a great King) are changeable creatures. Looke Plato ad Dion epis

Stat. anni. 25. therfore backward; The same, both Prince and Parlament, but two yeares before, had ratified that marriage with her mother for lawful; and inuested the ofspring of her body with the succession of the Crowne. Looke forwards but seauen yeares after, and the same both Head and Body, receiued Stat. Anni. 35. the Legitimation, repealed the anulling Statute, and pronouncing the Lady ELIZABETH for his lawfull Daughter, reduced the Crowne to HER right and Interest againe. So that, were not this Iesuite of HIS Schoole that takes so much text as serues his turne, that which Math 4. 5. makes against him, to leaue out; as hee had vpbraided her with a Statute blemishing, he might haue choaked him selfe with a Statute also honouring, aduancing, and truely possessing HER.

speaketh) one of the most substantiall for degree in the parish; 
                  Manifestat. pag. 90. he might haue recorded his owne Infelicitie, and rebuked his kind Mother; and not haue laid this ignominious slander vpon a Kings Daughter, his Natiue Soueraigne, and the Mother of his Country.
               
               64 In the meane time, it seemes the Pope hath an exorbicant power; that whereas both Law of God and Church exclude Bastards ab Ecclesia Domini, for bearing any office of Ecclesiasticall charge, yet admits this Manzer (so the vulgar Deut. 23. 2. cals him) to be a Iesuite, and a Rector among them: vnlesse hereby the Pope doe insinuate, as Sixtus Quintus did, Quodlib. p. 100 that he takes the whole societie for no other but a Bastardbrood; or that the College in the vacancie put vp their petition for Parsons to be their Head, beginning with that verse of the Poet, Iuuenal.
                  
                     Malo pater mihi sit Thersites—
                  
And I trow with all, that Parsons himselfe will account the Wisd. 3. 16. &c. Booke of Wisdome but an Apocrypha; else there's a Chapter will shrewdly touch him with a more greeuous Infelicitie then that Statute (which he mentioneth) will any way hurt that good and most Noble Queene Elizabeth.
               
               65 Now from her infelicitie passiue, hee comes, Numb. 12. First, to her Infelicitie repercussiue, how others for her sake were made vnhappy; as one in her brothers time for falling in loue with her: and others, as Wiat and Carew in her sisters time, raising Rebellion for Her:  And why doth he not rather say so much of the Whore of Babylon, and obserue what an vnlucky Religion that of Rome is, which intoxicates so many with her Philtra, her filthy Loue-Drugs; that for her sake they machinate and practise treasons against their lawfull Princes; and for their Treasons (vnder pretence of madding for Her) come to vnhappy Ends?
               66 But for loue matters, as that of the Admirall (bee it what it was) let him treat of them who once renounc't the study of Diuinitie, because (they are his owne wordes)

               68 For the time subsequent, wee yeeld; (if death deseruedly drawne on by demerit, may bee called crueltie in the Magistrate;) for after, Religion was made but the Stawking-horse to practise Treasons: if then the complaint be of Rigour, and request for more ease, wee say with S. Augustine (when he was intreated to mediate for a mitigation of some strait Lawes) nay, if Princes serue Christ in making Lawes for Christ, they doe what they ought, I will not

               69 And yet to examine this Crueltie, and Rigor thereof, we will not doe it by comparison of Popish Tyrannies, fearefull Tortures, and bloody Massacres: but first their owne Priests shall speake for QVEENE ELIZABETHS Lawes, who say, that considering Iesuiticall practises shadowed vnder cloake of Religion, all the Lawes enacted 
                  Quodlib. pag 269. 277. 
                  against Catholikes were made with great moderation and Clemencie, as comming from a Prince most milde and mercifull: nor they haue cause to verge repeale of any Statute made, so long
                  
                  as Iesuites take such courses. Secondly, one Fa. Parsons, who in the Preface of one of his Legends, commendeth Queene 
                  Preface to the first part of his triple Conuersion. 
                  Elizabeth for her MODERATE gouernment, and that was in the last yeere of her reigne. And yet by the way (for the mans singular honestie) it is worth noting, that in one and the same lease, hauing so commended her in one Page, (many then SHE was a liue) in the very next Page (for then he heard SHE was dead) in a Preface In eodē libello to his Maiestie he compares her to no other but Dioclesian for crueltie.
               70 Now belike, to ratifie that comparison, he would perswade vs heere, that it was not Treason, but Religion, vpon which she did practise her Crueltie; which hee prooues with such a Medusa-like Argument, as is able to strike the answerer into a stownd,—iuraret

Might not that good Queene complaine heere, as he once did, Theodorus. that what hee reached with the right hand, his Schoolers tooke with the left; and that a principall demonstration of her indulgence should be brought in for an apparant euidence of her Crueltie?
               
               71 Put the case that Absolon had beene an Idolater, as he was a Traitor; and King Dauid, after sentence passed against him for his vnnaturall Treasons, would haue acquitted him from death, conditionally, that he would renounce false gods, and worship onely the true God, in that manner which God himselfe had prescribed, and he refusing it is executed; shall we say he died for Religion, or for Treason? It was Mercie in the King to offer, but Wilfulnesse in the sonne to refuse a condition so easie and Religious.
               72 Or if some father had a leaud sonne, who to waste his wealth vpon harlots (like the Prodigall in the Gospell) should conspire with his brethren to robbe their father

Princes which make such gratious offers, doe therein shew their most Christian affections, that they desire the conuersion of men rather then their destruction; and looke rather to the sauing of their Subiects soules, then the safetie of their owne persons, as beeing contented to remit all by-past breach of Law and dutie to themselues, so they may make them truely religious toward God.

No one such qualitie either concomitant with Iealous feare appeared in her, which Histories in suspicious Tyrants do obserue: Her body not priuily armed; her eies (abroad) not whirled about; her Countenance not appalled; her Spirits not troubled; her sleepes not disquiet; no Stranger or Subiect (admitted to her presence) searched; nor any qualitie issuing from such feares, appeared in her gouernment.

And yet, that his hellish malice may leaue nothing (though neuer so sacred) vnsnarled at; as before hee brought in the Murther of his Maiesties Father for a paralell to the POWDER TREASON: so now hee reckoneth for one of her late Maiesties miseries the death of the Queene his Mother: whereby the Reader may iudge, how hee would vse his Maiesties owne fame if hee were gathered to his Fathers, when hee is glad to alleage so vnlauorie examples of both his Parents. That Renowned Queenes death was a miserie indeed to this whole Land, and the most indelible blot that can bee recorded of this Country: but that our late Soueraigne was abused therein, and that wicked act committed before her knowledge thereof, beside her notable expressing of her owne greefes when shee heard of it, other sufficient proofes haue fully resolued all honest men heereof. And since, our now Soueraigne, who had the neerest interest in that errand, was long agone satisfied by her Maiesties owne

purgation therein, it is a farre fetch't slander for a Iesuite, being not so much as that Queenes borne subiect, to awaken it now againe, out of so long dead ashes. But what may not the venome of Satan doc?

M. the younger (as he calls him) should commend OVR MOST GRATIOVS SOVERAIGNE for his kindnesse and Clemencie formerly shewed to their Catholikes, which he tearmeth OLEVM PECCATORIS, flattery and adulation.
               
               93 Is not this fellow truly Canis in praesepi, that can neither speake well himselfe, nor endure that vertue should haue her due commendation by othersi but as some write of the Galathians that will permit no Gold to come into their Country, and yet they will robbe any man that hath Gold about him: so he, being neither capable of vertue himselfe, nor inclinable to it, will not suffer it to be praised in them that haue it, without imputation of base flatterie; which cannot bee without touch of both parties: because none vse to flatter, but such as haue none other meanes to aduance themselues; and none loue to be flattered, but those which haue no true vertue to commend them: neither of which can take any hold of these persons, whom he thus slily scoffes in this place.
               94 For, the first whom he deciphereth with the letters of T. M. (as meane a Minister as Fa. Cow bucke makes him) was neuer so defectiue either of honourable alliance, or large Pag. 2. prouision of meanes, or many good deserts and qualities, that he need the vse and helpe of such Seruile Oile, whereby to glide more easily into preferments.

                  , a deprauing
                  
                  veine in it) euen by the Epistlers owne verdit, T. M. can be no SYCOPHANT; for they which delight in such Calumniations, and vse those Delatory accusations, they doe it Clanculum, and without witnesse: which gaue Aristoph. Plut. occasion to the Prouerbe, That the poison of a Sycophants tooth is immedicable, because the Secrecie of the biting is ineuitable: but T. M. doth this (by the Censurers confession) when his Maiestie takes his Repast, that is, in the hearing of many, and of some, as it seemes, which are Parsons Intelligencers, to send what they heare to Rome: so that the party being knowen, and the tale openly told, hee cannot be called a SYCOPHANT.
               106. Yet grant him this: wherein then consist his Sycophancies? What Figges reueales he? It seemes by the Apologue in Scripture, that they are a pleasant Fruit, and nothing Iudg. 9. 11. more sweet, by the ancient prouerbe; to which, first, because the Miracles in Romish Legends (so magnified) may Apud Aristop. well be compared, pleasant in the Eare, and good for nothing else but to passe the Time, T. M. perhaps, by occasion of Table-talke ministred, recounts some of them, at, and for the Kings Repast.
               
               107. As for example, omitting the old Stories of Saint Dionyse, that carried his owne head in his hand after it was strooken off; and of Clement the first, who when hee was cast into the Sea with a Mill-stone about his necke, the Sea Infest. Clem.

These are Figges indeed, pleasant in the care and in the taste: but Physitians write, that as such fruit (though Dioscor. lib. 1. very pleasant, breedes corrupt blood, and ingendereth such Creatures which may make Fryars Postils as currant and nimble as vitas-patrum: so it causeth choller also, procuring vnto men of setled iudgements, a zealous indignation, to see that Religion should be Pharmacized with such Drugs.
               110. Secondly, it may be also that this T. M. alighting vpon the Popes large extended Indulgences (which may fitly be compared to those Fig-leaues where with our first Parents couered their dishonourable parts) pardoning enormous sinnes for innumerable yeeres vpon sweet Conditions; as for kissing two iron Crosses at Saint Peters Church doore in Rome, fiue hundred yeeres of Pardon; for looking Indulg. Rom. liber. vpon one of the Pence for which our Sauiour was sold, 1400. yeeres Pardon; for beholding the Crosse vpon the top of Saint Iohn of Lateran his Steeple, 1400. yeeres Pardon: Why? Because that Crosse was made of the Sword which cut off Saint Iohn Baptists head. But all this is nothing, for Sixtus Quartus granted fortie thousand yeeres of Pardon to him that would say a Praier of his making, consisting of about forty fiue words: And why? Because his Catholikes might not complaine, that the Protestants satisfaction was easier then theirs. These, and such like, this T. M. recounting, procures his Maiesty some pleasure at his Repast; and like enough occasion was giuen for this, in discoursing of the Iesuites absoluing the POWDERTRAITORS from all their Sinnes, for so Worthie a Worke.
               
               111. Thirdly, because (as it appeares by the Prophet)

that all Figges are not of one quality, but like Grapes, some

               113. Lastly, to make him a perfect SYCOPHANT, Dion Coccei. because Stories doe mention Liuiaes Figge, which was both Poisoned and Poisoning, for so she serued the Figs that the Emperour Augustus vsed to taste of (which kinde, by report, is not strange in Italie) happily, as it may sort with the time, hee records out of some Romish Writers, what an excellent veine both Popes haue in Figging each other away, and Iesuites too (as the Prists relate) in dispatching with such pleasant Pilles, any that stand in their way or light.
               113. If this fashion of his be SYCOPHANCIE, speaking the truth vpon iust occasion offered, openly before Witnesses, alleging his Authours, pointing out the places, and reading them; he need not be ashamed of the Title, but (as Iob speaketh of his aduersaries booke) he may

                  take it, and binde it as a Crowne vnto him.
               
               114. In the meane time, is not that SYCOPHANCIE in the worst sense, that Iesuites, and principally Fa. Parsons, who in this kinde, they say, is Mereurius Solenniorum,

               115. That Garnet (the Arch-Traitor) was executed for reproouing the Protestants with some sharpe speeches; that his forehead receiued a Blow as he was dragg'd vpon the stones; and where the wound was, the signe of the ✚ appeared, and the blood dropping downe vpon the Printed in Spaine in Quarto with a ballad. Straw in the hurdle (others say it was at the Gibbet when he was bowelled, a tale much like the Iudges of Susannaes tree) and his face in full feature printed vpon the Straw (like another Veronica) and a Seraphins countenance therwithall, that so there might be two faces vnder one hood; and all this to bring Credit to their Societie: this may be called Sycophancie, by S. Pauls description, for speaking lies

                  through hypocrisie, without truth or testimony.
               116. Whereas Relation of Stories, either serious or pleasant (warranted by their owne Authors) is not Sycophancie, but Veritie. And if such discourse worke vpon his Maiesties affections respectiuely for anger or mirth, and make him cry out with the Poet,

               120. For albeit Commemoration of good turnes bee generally an exprobration, yet hath it, in some cases, warrant in Diuinitie: for, What could I haue done more vnto my Vineyard which I haue not done? said God to Israel for her Es. 5. 4. 
                  Sowre Grapes: and, Were there not ten cleansed? saith our Sauiour: thereby reproouing the vnthankfulnesse of nine, 
                  Luc. 17. 17. with recording the benefit. And in humane learning also, two principall reasons Plutarch yeelds among many other, De sui laude. how without enuy or blushing a man may commend himselfe, and recount his extended fauours; either against a Calumniator that doth abase or extenuate them; or an Vngratefull person that conceales them wholly, or requites them badly: which is no vpbraiding (saith hee) but in the former, an Apologie to cleere the slander; in the other, a reproofe to checke an ill nature.
               121. The Effects; viz. that it wrought in them that height of Pride, as in confidence of his Maiesties Clemency, they directly did expect, and assuredly promise vnto themselues Libertie of Conscience, and Equality in ALL things, with his Maiesties best and most faithfull Subiects.
               122. In censuring whereof, the Iesuite in three large Numb. 20. 21. 22. shewes himselfe both a scorning shifter, and a slie Sophister: for after he hath 
                     scoffingly plaid with those words [HEIGHT OF PRIDE] hee shifts them off, First, by running againe to his Common place of TORMENT OF CONSCIENCE, and in matching the liberty thereof (that is, Toleration of their Religion) with freedome of breathing the ane; (as if that ought as

Secondly, descended of a mother that thought her selfe beholding to the Catholikes. Thirdly, confessing that hee euer found the Catholiks partie most trustie to him; and rewarding them for it thereby gaue hope of like fauor to others. Fourthly, receiued with vniuersall ioy, trusting that as by his vniting of Two Kingdomes, he had conioyned the Obedience of Two Nations; so would he also haue entertai ned their Religion, thereby to vnite both sorts of his Subiects
                  
               
               123 His Sophistry he shewes in applying those wordes Height of Pride to One thing, which his Maiestie hath reterred to Twaine: for herein it consisted, that they not only expected liberty of Conscience, but also Equalitie of ALL things with vs. This last he leaues out, and insists only vpon the former. For grant it were but a Step of Pride vpon such slight presumptions to expect the first; yet to promise vnto themselues, together with that, to bee Equallie preferred and fauoured by a Prince so diuersly affected in Religion, and in a State so thorowly setled and well furnished with men more vndoubtedly loyall (a thing which his Maiestie both in his booke, and in his Gouernement denieth to his faithful natiue Subiects of both Kingdomes whom

                  He excludes from Offices of Iudicature and State, in Both Realmes respectiuely,) This is the Summitie and Sublimitie of Pride.
               
               124 Yet we will also ioyne that issue with him; that, not to desire and supplicate, nor to expect and hope (to which purpose hee bringes all his examples, varying from the point) the King 
                     •…
                  aith not so: but, which are his Maiesties words, DIRECTLY to expect, and assuredly to promise
                  
                  to themselues LYBERTY OF CONSCIENCE, is itselfe alone, a Celsitude of Pride.
               
               125 For, whether wee measure the height of Pride by Lucifer the Prince ouer all the Children of Pride, as Gregorie moralizeth Iobs Leuiathan, whose only presumption In Iob. 41. 25. Iude. verse. 6. Gen. 3. of Libertie without warrant, was both his in-bred Pride, causing his owne ouerthrow, and his infused Pride to our first Parents, procuring their fall: or by Scholestricall Diuines, who confine all proud men within two sorts; One, of Aquin. 22. q. 33. 5. them which aduance themselues aboue others; the second, which arrogate to themselues that which is aboue them, and beyond their pitch: this Selfe-promising assurance of those Catholikes for Libertie of Conscience, cannot bee placed but in the Highest degree of pride, because it assureth a matter both vnwarranted, and farre aboue their compasse, and beyond their dutie.
               126 It being first, Impious against God, who Symbolically forbids such mixture in the Linsey-wolsey-garment, 
                  Deut. 22. 11. 1. Reg. 18. 21. 
                  Metaphorically vpbraides it when he calls it halting between two opinions; directly inhibiteth it in aduising not to draw in a counter

                     ecting yoake with Infidells (much lesse with Heretikes, 2. Cor. 6. 14. by Romish Diuinitie: because the first ariseth by ignorance, the other growes strong by pertinacie:) pincheth at the permission of diuers Factions of different opinions Apoc. 2. 14. 15 within the Same Church, and threatneth the Toleration thereof with Reuenge; brandeth euen very good Kings with 2 Reg. 15. 3. 4 34. 35. a perpetuall Censure, for not preuenting or enduring it; seuerely punisheth it in the Samaritans, who feared the true

Now, to Communicate Epiphan, lib. 1 de Samaris. with a sinne, is equally liable to the same punishment with the sinne, and the Magistrates permitting, is a Communicating.
               
               127 Secondly, it being a matter dishonourable to the King, DIRECTLY to expect, and ASSVREDLY
                  
                  to presume of it, is an Extremitie of Pride. For honest men (euen of their equals) will expect nothing but that which shall stand with the credit and reputation of the Grantèrs: onely Iesuites fugitiues from their Country, without leaue, and against Lawe (as if they had beene Conquerors of the Land, or the sole Disposers of the Crowne) presume vpon a Libertie for hereticall superstition: Et rei per se faedissimae

               135 And it seemes this Iesuite doth so, by the sleight resemblance hee maketh, in comparing the Libertie of Conscience, to breathing and vsing the Common-ayre: as if the King might as safely grant, and they as freely challenge the one as the other. Surely were the Doctrine which they sucke, like the Ayre which they take in, this, first, concocted, and prepared by seuering and purging the impuritie thereof, before it breed or feed the vitall Spirits; so the other, cleansed from the Dregs and corruptions where of it is compounded, the best turned into Nutriment of the Soule, the rest cast out as excrement; the restraint of both were too seuere, and this resemblance might carry some sway. But, seeing that both the Principles which are deliuered, infect the very Inwards, and they which take Plin. lib. 7. ca. 2. them in (like the Psilli in Africa) doe contagiously re-infect the very ayre which they breath with a pestilent Sauour

of superstition and Disloyaltie; alienating the mindes of their cohabitants, as well from the true Seruice of God, as from their dutie and allegeance to their Soueraignes; the comparison is vnfit, and the restraint different: the vse of Common ayre may be left free, and yet Libertie of Conscience precluded to such infecting Doctrine, and infected spirits.
               
               136 His Recrimination (which is the second shift) is drawn from Domesticall and forreine examples. Domesticall; first Moderne, of those which in matters of Ceremony, and Church gouernment, differ and seuer themselues from vs:

For if these humble Vnderlings (as hee calles them) dwelling among vs, differing in matters Onely Ceremoniall, are not heard in that their claime of Liber
                        •…
                     e; it is an audacious Boldnes for those who in points essentiall and fundamentall are seuered from vs, to expect that which to them is denied. The truth is, the obstinate Plea of our Reformers for such Libertie, hath

beene the verie life and soule of the heart, and hope of this Presumptuous Expectation in the Romanists; which, by the brotherly and vnanimous concurrence of the other with vs, had long agoe beene quelled and crushed.
               137 The other part is of Domesticall ancient Examples, namely of Lollards and Wickliuists, beating vpon that argument; and conspiring against the Prince, vpon the Deniall. Their Conspiracies, if any such were, (but the contrarie is pregnantly prooued by Master Foxe, who coped Acts & Momū in Hen. 5. with Harpsfield shrowded vnder the borrowed habit of Allen Cope, in the tryall of that point) we defend not: Subiection to Princes we preach; Insurrections we defie: lawfull Conuentions for Gods seruice we allow; mutinous bandings or Conuenticles seditious we condemne. To Supplicate vnto Princes, and to make friends of the greatest, (with modestie and sobrietie) for enioying a freedome to serue God in that maner, which they are perswaded truely is moste conformable to his word, that is allowable: If petitions be denyed. Submission with patience is Christian humilitie, and the Euangelicall Precept: but with reuerated Impudencie to presse, or vnd

                     full tearmes to threaten, or banded Routs either to enforce a grant, or daunten the Prince, is diuelish Pride, and Disloyall Conspiracie. The answer therefore in briefe is this: Did they well that claimed this libertie? Why then were they condemned? Did they not well? Why doe those Catholikes strike vpon that string so oft, and expect the grant with such confidence? Had the King done well in giuing them that Libertie? Then was the Pope to blame, who incited him against them. If hee did well to denie them, it is iniurie (if not impudencie) in these Catholikes, to craue that for themselues, which they thought fit to be denied to others.
               138 The forraine examples, as of the higher Germany in the time of Charles the fifth, and of the Low Countries are no fit precedents for our State: the gouernmēt of the Emperor beeing limited and conditional; which he transgressing,

they by their Lawes and Customes had warrant to oppose, and stand for their impeached Libertie. For euery Sleidan. lib. 18.

Now what Argument call you this? Seuerall Magistrates in their particular Iurisdictions, challenge their liberty of conscience, according to custome anciently continued, and vpon conditions mutually and formerly capitulated: therefore Subiects vnder an absolute Monarchie must Claime it of their Souereigne, and at least expostul

               139 Yea, but in Bohemia, Polonia, Hungaria, &c. which are gouerned by Kings, the like is vrged and tollerated. Were the entrance into those Kingdomes, successiue, not Electiue: or, if by Descent, without conditionall restraints, the exāple were more proper: but it is wel known (as it hath beene answered) that many of those Kings, willing enough to reduce their Countries to one Profession, haue had both their desire and power restrained by the Nobles; and were receiued of their Commons at their first entrie, with that Prouiso, that their accustomed Libertie of Conscience bee no way prohibited or interrupted. If then they (as Traian the Emperor, when at the admitting of a Praetor, girding his sword, he gaue it him with these wordes, If I rule according to Lawe, vse this FORME: if contrarie to Law, vse it AGAINST ME) are contented so to Capitulate for maintaining their Subiects Liberties, their Allegeance (by their owne Law) is no longer tyed, then the other Condition is performed.
               140 Yet grant they were absolute Monarkes which eyther yeelde or offer such Libertie of Conscience, what's that to his Maiestie? who in Cases of Religion takes not mens

examples, but Gods lawes for his Directs: HEE knowes what Princes ought to doe, not regarding what they please to doe, being desirous rather to gouerne by Christian pietie, then Irreligious Policie. HEE knowes it to be obserued both by Iewish and Christian Diuines, that the diuersity of Religion Tollerated by King Salomon in Diuine worship, was by God required vpon his Heire and next Successor, 
                  1. Reg. 12. 
                  Iure Talionis, by a retaliated diuision of an vnrecouerable rupture in the Ciuill Gouernment: and therfore how can they, or why should they, Expect or promise it to themselues from his Maiestie?
               141 Yes (saith hee) first, because HEE was FREE from Crueltie and persecution before: that is to say, HIS Maiestie is naturally mercifull; therfore hee must become carelesly Irreligious: for, to licence Idolatrie, is to communicate with Impietie. Moses was a very milde man, aboue al the men that were vpon the earth (saith the holy ghost) Numb. 12. 3 yet when he spied a Calse in the Campe, hee proclaimed a bloody Massacre, and pronounced the execution to bee a Exod. 32. 27. 29. 1. Sam. 2. 
                  Consecration. It was not Ely his Clemencie, in suffering his sonnes to prophane Gods Sacrifice, that could excuse him from a fearefull punishment.

               142 Secondly, HIS Mother held herselfe much beholden to Catholikes. To the Lay Gentlemen for their Faithfulnesse and Allegeance she did perhaps; but had She not relyed too much vpon the Priested sort, her End had not beene so sudden nor vnkinde. This Iesuits meaning is (for true loue to his Maiestie, no doubt) thus to cast salt into his eies, or to stirre reuenge in his heart, by the often Repetition of his Royall Mother. In the meane time, is it

not a violent presumption vpon a valiant ground: The Mother loued Catholikes for their dutifulnesse and Loyaltie: Ergo, The Sonne must giue them libertie of Conscience, though defiled with Idolatrie against God; and enuenomed with Treasonable malice against his Person? Religion is not deriued Ex Traduce, it is the infusion of the Spirit, not a conueyance by Descent; it is the instinct of grace, not the instilling of Nature. The Sonne of Thare, who was an Idollmaker, became, and had the name to be a father of the faithfull: and the heire of Hezekiah a most religious King, became Rom 4. 2.

                     ligion. God hath reuealed the one by commandement; he reserues the secret iudgement of the other to himselfe: for it is not Romes Diuinitie, but Gods Booke that makes good Subiects: and ti's verie probable, that when his Maiestie hath cast vp his account of former Disloyalties, he shall finde the moderate and Direct Protestant (that inclines neither to right nor left, depends not vpon Popes indulgence, nor pleades for Presbyters Discipline) to bee the fast and faithfull Subiect: THAT Diuinitie eyther of Deposing Princes, or surprising their Parsons, or renouncing Allegeance, being found neither in Books, nor practise of any, but such as are either Iesuited, or Geneuated.
               144 Fourthly, his Maiesties entrie to this Realme, was applauded with vniuersall reioycing. If hee had said Generall, that is, Ex generibus singulorum, that the most of alsorts receiued HIS Maiestie, euen as King Solomon, when he was

proclaimed, with such shoutes of ioy, that the earth rang 1. Reg. 1. 40. with the sound of them, it is most true: or if by vniuersal, hee ment through the whole Land, and of all true-hearted Subiects, it is his Maiesties comfort, and was no more then their Duety. For how can it be but that the members of the body should expresse their ioy at his accesse, who is the head of their guidance, and the breath of their Nosthrils? but if hee take vniuersall for euerie Subiect, howsoeuer affected; either his speech is not true; or their ioy was vnsound. For some of them, before euer they had seene his face towards vs, were plotting Treasons against him: and others had Breues in their Cabinets, if powre had concurred, or occasion fitted, to impeach HIM. So the vniuersall Bishop, (as Antichrist tearmes himselfe) was no Party, Greg. Mag. nor Friend in this Vniuersall Ioy; nor this filius vniuersi, Fa. Parsons, for hee in his Viro D

               145 And that the ioy was not vniuersally vnfeyned, 
                  himselfe doth implicitè, confesse it: for their Reioycing was (saith hee) in hope of LIRERTIE: that's a mercenarie respect, no entire ioy: for true loue seeketh not her owne, (saith Saint Paul. Had it beene sincere and simple, then (being 1. Cor. 13. commanded) they would performe Obedience; or if crossed, they would submit with patience: for perfect 
                     Ibid. Psal. 18. loue, neither disdaineth, nor repineth, nor falleth away. But strange Children will faile; Dauid found it by experience; and that was their purpose, as this Iesuite purports; for (saith hee) they MEANT to serue him faithfully; but now, defeated of their hope, their Ioy is quailed, and that MEANING altered.
               146 The last reason he vseth for the ground of this Presumption: is (as Salomon speaketh) carbones ad prunas, 
                  Pro 26. 21.

                   Why should not the Catholikes hope of equall fauour from his Maiestie with T. M. and his fellowes, who hauing beene old enemies, and alwaies borne a hard and hatefull hand and tong against his Maiestie, both in Sermons, Bookes, and speeches, all the time of the late Queenes reigne, must now bee so priuiledged. (Nullis meritis praecedentibus) as they will suffer none to bee equally preserred with them?
               
               147 This is the Deuils humor vp and downe; first, as hee is DIABOLVS, a Calumniating forger of malitious Leasings (for there is not one word of all this true) yea, it was the heartie ioy of T. M. and his fellowes, (wee need not be ashamed of our society) in that Orbity and age of our late Souereigne, that there was an HEIRE to the Crowne apparant, though not by a Declaration, yet, maugre all Opposites (Iesuitic all and Infernall) apparant by Deuolution, and vn-auoideable Succession; moste soundly grounded both in the essentiall points of Religion

                   & royally affected to the outward policy of this Church-Gouernment: which ioy, so far as without offēce they might, they did expresse. Secondly as he is SATHAN, an aduersarie of Peace, a sower of Discord (whose Kingdome fares best, when there is most distraction, thus to set enmity between the Sword, and the Keyes; a Gratious Prince, and his Loyall Clergie: but Apage Satana, saith his Sacred Maiestie. Thou perceiuest not the things that bee of God: for it is HIS propertie, Psal. 68. 
                  to make men to bee of one minde in an house: and it is the duetie of euery true Christian (by the Apostles aduise) As much as in him lieth, to haue peace with all men; much more to preserue and nourish it betweene Prince and Subiect. 
                  Rom. 12. Thirdly as he is LVCIFER, to challenge (as in their Doctrine) God, for Heauens inheritance, so (in their Pride) the King for earthes preferment, as Debt

               148 Preferment of Many is the amplitude of a kings power: the singling out of Some is the Libertie of his choice, and where there is lesse desert, there Grace is the larger, and the streiter bond to t

               149 For had not the truly-affectionate acknowledgement and gratulation, been more entire and sincere from T. M. and his Fellowes, then hitherto hath beene shewed from the Head and Members of the Romish Synagogue, his Maiestie, might too iustly haue said of England, as they did of Canaan, Bonaterra, sed Mala gens, the Land is pleasant and rich, but the people are the Sonnes of Anak, Monstra

                  Augustin.

                     ndere, nolit rependere. It is too bad a disposition that will neither affoord loue, nor requite it; neither offer it with kindenesse, nor returne it with acknowledgement.
               150 THIS, because it pleaseth his Maiestie to exaggerate, by enumeration of his manifolde benefits, and gracious Clemencie towards them; both by release from greeuances of Purse, of Prison, by accesse to his presence, by additions of honour, by rescue from death, (though conuicted, though sentenced) and many such: thereby to

                  Embroider the Popes Ingratitude, and to heape coales of fire vpon their heads, who had heaped vp Coales for Fire to haue taken off at ONCE so many heads: how disdainfully this Iesuite accounts of the One, and how simply hee answereth for the other, will appeare as followeth.
               
                  151 For first, Numb. 24. in the Margin, hee tearmeth his Maiesties rehearsall, an EXPROBRATION, which (as was said before) is rather an expostulation for returned vnkindnes: because to twit vnthankfull men with recounting the good turnes which they haue receiued, is no vpbraiding of bitternesse, but a necessitie of Reproofe. Neither is such Enmeration an Aduocate to pleade for requitall, but a looking-glasse to present to the parties their owne deformitic, and to exhibit to strangers a view of both: lest taking knowledge of disloyall courses enioyned of the one part; and with all, not vnderstanding the benefits bestowed by the other, they might take them to bee inforcoments vpon hard measure offered, that are truly the issues of corrupt natures ill disposed: and this course God himselfe tooke; first, recounting his benefits, then calling 
                  Esa. 13. Heauen and earth to witnesse betweene him and his people; and lastly m

                  ng the parties Iudges vnto themselues of their owne vnthankfulnesse, Sapè enim opus est,

                  malis Exactore, etiam bonis admonitore: forgetfulnesse in good men requires admonition, in ill men an exaction, saith Seneca.
               
               152 Secondly, after hee hath set downe, Number, 24. his Maiesties particulars of those benefits; hee concludes it Numb. 25. with Pilats Ecce Homo, this Ieting scorne, Thus writes THIS MAN.
                   Belike some contemptible fellow of the Plebeian sort; or fome refuse Scribe like vnto Fa. Parsons, that Writes hee knowes not how, nor careth what: yet well fare King Saul, though forsaken of God, (when Dauid repeated the kindnesse which hee had shewed him in sparing his life, euen when the Lord had deliuered 1. Sam. 24. 10. &c. him vp; and some of his fellowes had eg'd him on to

kill Saul; and for an euident token thereof, let him see the skirt of his Garment cut off,) hee had the grace (at leaste the ciuilitie) to acknowledge the kindenesse, not onely in good tearmes, (Is this the voice of my Sonne Dauid?) but Vers. 17. 18. with a detestation of himselfe, for dealing so ill with him (thou art more righteous then I:) and also an Obtestation for a blessing from God, The Lordrender thee good, for thy good done to mee this day:) but this Iesuite comes short euen Seneca vbi. supra. of the Stoikes vse, who wisheth benefits to be recorded, and repeated to a forgetful receiuer, vt sic nescisse se aut mentiatur, aut doleat, for so he shall eitherlie in denying that he hath receiued them; or bee sorie and greeue, that he did not acknowledge them: for this fellow, his memorie being rub'd, denies not the benefits, yet scarsely acknowledgeth them to bee benefits, but turnes them off with a scornefull extenuation, SVCH AS THEY WERE, like enough not worthy the naming: too meane (no doubt) for a King to giue; and too base (belike) for such true Subiects, (the Popes vassals) to receiue.
               153 Sed Stulto intelligens, quid interest? a Right noble Lord, truely honourable in himselfe, and soundly Loyall to his Soueraigne (who knowes what belongs to Religion and Duetie) after particular Enumeration of the verie same with comfort, weighing them in the iust Ballance of wisdome and thankfulnes, acknowledgeth them, for the weight and price, to bee Many Talents, and a large portion of grace and bountie. But this is the Kings Comes No▪

               155 Surely then is the Pope either vnnaturall; for a true head hath a perfect Simpathy with the members as well for mirth as for greefe; to bee merrie with the ioyful, as to weepe with the sorrowfull (that's Saint Pauls rule:) or Magn

The Elder Brothers

               156 But indeede in the Pope t'is verie Pride: a qualitie which is euer querulous, repining if in euerie thing the turne may not at all hands bee serued; neuer thankeful, as challenging all Curtesies (euen of the greatest states,) to be debts of meere duty, & offices of Obliged Allegeance; Sed cesset Gratiarum decursus, si non fuerit recursus (saith Bernara) if the Pope haue no more feeling of benefits bestowed Bern. in Cā

Marrie as for the Catholikes (saith he) they accept euen the least fauour gratefully, hoping to haue receiued much greater, (as due vnto them) if his Maiestie had not beene preuented by Sinister Information.
               
               157 Heere Iudas is turned into Caiphas, and speakes a truth, as President to the Councell for the POWDERPLOT; the reuealing wherof by a Letter vnexpected, hee cunningly cals a Sinister Information, which indeede preuented his maiesty from feeling the euent of that dreadfull
                  
                  Designe; and them also of their greater hopes, which heere hee cals their DVE, as if ALL but THEY were Vsurpers; for had not that preuention hapned, the greatest places of the Land (which THEY in hope had swallowed) had beene ere now at their disposall; and this Preuention hee cals Sinister, as vnluckie to them: otherwise hee should haue said, that his Maiestie had further enlarged & continued those fauours, but that hee was Preuented, not by Sinister Informations of others, as T. M. &c. But by a Dexter combination of themselues, Iesuits and Gentlemen; they councelling, these complotting: they concealing, these engining; they absoluing, these resoluing; all, together vowing and swearing, and sealing with the Sacrament Secrecy and Villany. And this saith his Maiestie was the Labrusca, the sower fruite returned, & the whole recompence that was made, for his former indulgence of Grace and bountie.
               
               158 Which speech, this Miles Gloriosu
                        •…
                     
                   (in disdaine) calleth a Calumniation of THIS MAN (as, THIS PVBLICAN, saith the Pharisee) And why a Calumniation? first, in respect of the Time, because there had been Persecution before that treason, namely the pecuniarie mulcts imposed in Queene Elizabeths time, once Remitted by his Maiestie, were presently recalled againe; the Arrerages exacted, & for leuying therof mens houses ransacked, Cattel seysed, Rents streyned, and Tenants vexed, as in a common spoile aad Desolation.
                  
               
               159 Heere are words of a Tumult, or rather a tumult of words, to make a Tragedie of trifles, and a storie of Fables, trussed vp together like a Mountebankes packe of Vnsauerie Intelligences, conueyed vnto him by some of his Malitious and illuding Agents. But in these cases, other maner of States-men, and better acquainted with the course of such proceedings are to bee heard. First, that the Arrerages of those Mulcts in the Queenes time, being due debts to the Crowne, were not wholly remitted; but

(which was a principall fauour) by a speciall Commission to Comes Northam. orat. ad Garnet. that purpose directed, Recusants had libertie to compoūd, almost for what tearme, and at what rates they might best, and with most ease satisfie. Secondly, that those meane profits which had accrued since the Kings time, to his Maiestie for their Recusancie, were forgiuen to the principall Gentlemen, who had both at his Entrie, shewed so Comes Salisb. orat. ad Digby. much Loyaltie, and had kept themselues freefrom all Conspiracies. Thirdly, for the ransacking and the distreyning which hee talkes of, if it were according to Law, it is warranted; if otherwise, it was punished. For that was a further fauour of his Maiestie to command that those Officers 
                  Comes Northampt. vbi supra should bee punished, which made a prey of Penalties, and a pèrsonall priuate gaine by the publike iustice of the State.
               160 But admit it were all true he speakes, (as euerie word is false) did not the Treasons of your good friends, (Fa. Parsons) Watson and Clerke breake out first, and a second Combination (not without a Popish Priest) after that? vpon which, some Principall Recusants were sent for, to Hampton Court, and dismissed with the fauour before specified? And grant it were before the POWDER CONSPIRACIE fell out, it was not before those Traitors fell into it, or another as desperate as that, which was the Preamble vnto this.
               161 A second reason why hee calleth it a Calumniation, is in respect of the effect;
                   
                     Wherein Clemeneie (saith hee) is made the cause of that POWDER TREASON, which neither was so, nor can be so; first, because CLEMENCIE dooth not exasperate men or Beasts; but the Treason was a Plot of MEN PROVOKED. Secondly, no Philosopher in his institution of a common-weale, or securitie of a Prince, puts CLEMENCIE for a cause of such effects. Thirdly, No examples of any prince who came to disastrous ends, doe warrant THAT to be the cause of their violent Deathes, and therefore this is a STRANGE ASSERTION.
                  
               
               
                  
162 Is this Iesuite a Preuaricator in the cause of those Traitors, or a Proctor for them? For this verie same is his Maiesties argument & aggreeuance, that his CLEMENCY should exasperate any to such a Treason, as was Singular from all examples, different from all Instructions of Policy, and degenerate from the nature of Men or Beastes: for in nature, the fiercenes of wilde Sauages, by milde handling Iac. 3. is tamed; and in Politikestates, the more certaine securitie to Princes, (for their safetie) is by mansuetude and Clemencie; 
                  Senec de Clem. li. 1. and None but Tyrants are noted for examples of not leauing their liues,—Sine Caede & Sanguine: and therfore Horace. they, who against a moderate Prince should intend so bloody a death, shewed themselues to bee more vnduetifull and vnnaturall then wilde men or Beasts.
               
               163 And yet that discontented and Rebellious humors are caused and nourished in some by Clemencie, is no strange Assertion, either in Nature or Pollicie, whether for position or example (as this great Philosopher doth confidently auerre it;) for, as in Nature, some vegetable creatures the more tenderly they are touched, the more they will sting (as nettles, which being crushed hard, will reflect no Plut. de discer. adulat. smart:) so in the sensitiue, some so fierce, that no discipline (violent or moderate) will cicure them; others so malignant, that the more kindely they are handled, the more currish they are, (as some Dogs, stroake them, they will snarle, strike them they will crouch:) So in Philosophy, the Seneca. rule being generall, that Actu

Augustine applies it) because our Sauiour (saith he) in the depth of his benignitie, rendred good for euill; therfore they in August. in eum locum. the height of their maliguitie, would render him euill for good. Secondly, Kings Christian; Berengarius the Emperor had no such Treacherous enemy as Flambertus,

For no vnkindenesse can you lay against me, but that I haue not beene at all Vnkinde.

               165 And therefore, that there should be so bad dispositions, in which Clemencie (so gratious a vertue) should worke so gracelesse fruits, argues a Strange affection: but that Clemency should exasperate some natures to disloyaltie, is no such Strange Assertion in Philosophy, eyther humane or diuine; no more then that the same Sunnes heat should exhale a fragrant fauour out of the flowers in the field, and a loathsome stench from a dead Corps in the same Champian. For sore eyes will smart in that light, whereby the sound eye receiues the helpe and comfort: Ist is adiumentum, illis tormentum, saith S. Augustine. And August. contra.

or, if in force, that the breach of Statutes enacted, and contempt of Kings Edicts proclaimed, were either a Peccadilio, or no sinne at all, Sauls Edict, transgressed by Ionathan, neither God himselfe (as it seemes) tooke well, nor the King would be satisfied for the transgression, but by 1. Sam. 14. 27. &c. 
                  allotting to Death his owne sonne. And what was the offense? casting of an hony-combe, contrary to command. Christian Princes and States, for their securitie, enact Lawes, and promulge Decrees, in cases of higher nature; by abandoning Seducers to Idolatrie, and Perswaders to Disloyalty; contempt and breach of both ensueth, and the punishment vpon the Transgressors must be intitled Persecution. The Bishop of Rome his Breues to interdict Allegeance, must, vppon dreadfull Censures (without contradiction) be obeied. The Monarch of great Britaine his Proclamations, to disburden his Realme of a VIPEROVS BROOD, must bee either calumniated, or sans-punie transgressed. Whereas Diuinity teacheth Christians, that Princes Edists (not made against Christ) are propounded to alacrity of subiection, not variety of construction, much lesse to contempt by violation. When Emperours hold the truth (saith Saint Augustine) they command for truth; which whosoeuer despiseth, purchaseth to himselfe Iudgement.

But doth not this fellow complaine 2. Sam. 16. 9. of ease? For Pownd (notwithstanding the Censure of that High Court, and this foule crime) was ficed by his Maiestie from the corporall punishment; and no penny is yet demanded of the Fine by Sentence imposed.
               170 In Numb. 31. (which is the next) he passeth ouer (as he saith) Hereford and Lancashire Persecutions. A transition of that, which because it is not at all, he letteth goe; for had there beene any such thing, he that so rhetorically bewailes the Calamity of Shittles children in Oxford (who had none, or but one at most then aliue) is neither so mealemouthed to conceale them in silence, nor so briefly stiled to passe them ouer with sleightnesse.
               171 But there is one horrible Persecution that strikes him into an agonie, which, as if he were Carrying the Crosse with Simon of Cyren, he calleth a New ANG ARI ATION, THEN first brought vp; namely, that men should be bound to pay for their WIVES Recusancie. The remedy is easie: let them garre there Wiues to frequent the Church, and then they shall not bee Angariated in their

                  , to carry a sway ouer them, which S. Paul permits not in a peremptory denyall. Were their Wines Recusants 1. Tim. 1. 12. before they tooke them? They deserued to be mulcted for their bad choise. Prooue they so afterward? They deserue it (much rather) for their carelesse regard. And if the Lacedemonians set a great fine vpon their King, for tak ing a little woman to his Queene, giuing the reason, that she Plutar. would bring forth Regulos, not Reges Kinglings, not Kings; much more are such to be punished for taking or suffering their Wiues Recusants, in respect of the hereditarie danger. For Men haue not those insinnating meanes, to seduce others to their Superstition, as Women haue; especially, the Mothers Religion is (for the most part) deriued to the Children, because to Her the principall care of their Education is committed.

                     ected the Petition of the Catholiks, in writing for Tolleration;
and Mitigation of Calamities.
 This, indeed, is a new kinde of pressure; an Insolent Petition is offered; the first request whereof is (as before was said) Impious against God, dishonorable to his Maiestie, and iniurious to the State; his Maiestie denies it, that's a Persecution. Then were all the Christian Emperors Persecutors, who forbad either publike Vide Codicem place, or priuate house for assembly of Heretikes; and Saint Ambrose was either a spirituall Persecutor, or an insolènt Rebel,

It is a cruell pitty which procures hazard to the Kings safety.
               174 Yea, but this Petition was answered by a Minister

               175 Yet another Persecution; His Maiestie yeelded to a 
                  Conference betweene Protestants and Puritanes, concerning Differences of Religion; to Catholikes none at all. It is a strange humour, that this Epistlor hath; if he say truth he lies. It is true, there was a Conference; but about difference in Religion, it is vtterly false. Faine they would possesse the world, that we are at Iarre among our selues, about our Religion; whereas the Quarrell, though it bee (indeede) vnkinde, yet it is not in this kinde; saue onely for Ceremonies externall, no points substantiall (for those are the Iarres of Popish writers.) This difference about things indifferent, his Maiestie desirous to reconcile, that as in the substance there was an Vnitie, so in the Circumstancies there might bee an vniformitie, vouchsafed his Princely paines to moderate and mediate.
               176 And Why not the Catholikes obtaine the like fauor? First their opinions touch the very Heades and foundation of Religion; in the truth whereof, his Maiestie knowing good reason for himselfe to bee so firmely setled, and finding this Realme so truely grounded, that being perfect in all the Arguments of the aduerse part, and throughly vnderstanding the weaknesse of them, hee held it both vnsafe and vnnecessary. For if the rule bee true in Architecture, a Corner stone, (though somewhat amisse laid) is not to bee stirred; much lesse Religion, being throughly well placed, and so hauing long continued, is to bee disputed. Secondly, Puritans, though they haue peenish mindes, and refractarie against the Lawes for Ceremoni

                  Whirle winde in a Chariot of Fire. Thirdly, did those great and Princely paines his Maiestie tooke with the Puritanes, worke a generall comformitie? with the Iudicious and discreete it did, but the rest grewe more aukward and violent: the like or worse yssue would haue ensued the other Conference; for after all paines taken and arguments pressed, Ca. 17. 5. quis who must be Judge to determine? Deiu noster Papa; for to doubt of that, is a Sacriledge saith Gratian; and then, if HE a ward not for his owne emolument (beeing in his owne Element (he hath left his old wont, as King Henry the eight Sleid. lib. 11. wrote to one of his predecessors.
               177 Neither yet doe Persecutions cease; but Num. 32. Which was a greater vexation, his Maiestie confirmed all that heape of Constitutions and Canons made by the Arch-bishop of Canterburie, and Bishop of London. It was a good Argument of Christs integritie, that Saduces and Pharisees, (each opposite to other in Capitall points of Religion) should both of them carry dislike of our Sauiour, Math. 22. and combine against him▪ and it maketh much for the credit of those Canons, that Papists and Puritanes (so seuered in opinions) should both conioyne in the reproofe of them. Wherein then lieth the Vexation? in the sharpnesse of the Censure annexed thereto? First, that argues the Corruptnesse at the heart in Catholikes, and the excellencie of the Constitutions, as Saint Paul argueth for Gods Law. For the Rom. 7. Commandement is iust and good in it selfe, but it workes feare, and anguish, and death in the corrupt nature of the disobedient. Wilt thou therefore not feare? doe well and obey. Secondly in the sto

                  Verse 36. Our Souereigne, of meere grace, remitted to them their liues, and by his Proclamation exiled them the Land. Death is the Penalty to Shemei, if he passe ouer the Riuer; the same is their punishment, if they passe the Seas hither: Shemei transgresseth in seeking his run-awaies beyond the Verse 40. Riuer; and his contempt is punished according to the Sentence: they returne hither, to make Run-awaies or Rebels; Execution is performed according to Law. It is not Shemei his railing (for King Dauid had pardoned it simply, and King Solomon conditionally) but his breach of Couenant that caused his Death: it is not their Religion (which is not once called into question) but their Contempt of Lawes and Edicts, which puts an End to their liues.
               183. As for telling tales in the Indies, that is proprium quarto modo to the Iesuites, who make it a principall part of their profession to winne credit to their Societie by Indian Fables. Were it not for Congo, or Cochachine, or Iaponia, or the Maluchees, or other part of the Indies, East or West, Bozius had lost that signe of the true Church, and Xauerius,

                  Aquin. vbi supra. which hee mentioneth, there is neither New, nor Strange, nor Rigorous punishment; but a reuiuall of certaine Statutes before enacted, and all grounded vpon the ancient Lawes of the Land, made 200. yeeres since, in the times of Edward the Third, and Richard the Second.
               187. In the examples of Priests executed, hee shewes himselfe to be that same Turpissima Bestia, a practised Aequiuocator: 
                  
                     They died EXPRESLY (saith he) for not taking the OATH:   which in some sense is true, because they were sentenced to death for being in the Land, contrary to Law and the Kings Edict: their life was offred them, if they would take the Oath: Drury at first accepted the condition, afterwards refused it; the other would none, vnlesse he might doe it priuately, remotis Testibus, that so hee might moresafely denie it afterward: vpon this they were executed: which conuinceth them of a double crime: first, Contempt of his Maiesties Lawes, to returne or abide in the Land, contrary to the same: Secondly, Obstinacie, in refusing such gratious Fauour offred vpon so reasonable tearmes, to take an Oath whereby they should Only manifest their trusty and vn-treasonable Allegeance to his Maiestie. So that they died Refusing the OATH: but that they EXPRESLY died for Refusing it, that's false: the Sentence of death was passed vpon them before the mutuall offer, or refusall. Which Offer, as on his Maiesties behalfe, it expresseth a singular Indulgence, and tender desire to spare-Blood; so is it an exact Triall of their Allegeance, whereby the King may see, whether (as the Philosopher speaketh) though they be Parum Sani, they be, notwithstanding, Seneca.

Neither is the case any other, then if a Woman, false to her husband for his bed, and withall attempting the poisoning of him (being conuict and condemned for the crime of Poisoning) were offred her pardon, conditionally, that shee would sweare, for euer after, to keepe herselfe honest, and alone to her husband; shee refuseth it, and is executed; it is true that she dieth renouncing the Condition, but not for renouncing it; her iudgement for death was passed before vpon the criminall attempt.
               188. But the Preamble to the examples is worthy the noting; for what hee sets downe as a Triumphant Garland to the offenders, 
                     Death (saith hee) is lesse greeuous vnto many of them, then the other Persecutions
                    (how many and greeuous they were, hee did before inlarge) is a staine to their Profession, and may be a Caneat to his Maiestie; it being a marke rather of desperate Pagans, then Consecrated Priests: for S. Paul, though professing his resolution in Cupiodissolui, (arguing his desire to bee loosed hence, and to be with Christ) yet when his death was vowed by the

Tim. 4. 17. was he from rushing into the breach of any Nationall Law, to hasten his death. A Caueat it may be to his Maiestie: for the saying of the Philosopher is very true: Vitae tuae Dominus est, quisquis suam contempsit: He that is prodigall of

                  Blood alight vpon the Popes head, as the principall cause.
               
               189. Which speech after hee hath, Num. 34. with his viperous Glosse, varied into these phrases, 
                     [Hee insinuates, and expresly threatens, that there may chance to bee a greater persecution, and more abundant shedding of Blood, which must alight vpon the Popes head] hee applieth it two waies: One is, a Taxation of his Maiesties cruelty, as expressing heereby his desire to Ingolph himselfe in the effusion of Catholikes Blood; and also his Hypocrisie, shrowding his iniurious crueltie, either vnder the name of Iustice, or vnder pretence of the Popes entermedling: the other application is by way of comfort to the Catholikes.
                  
               
               190. If I will that he tarry till I come, saith our Sauiour, Ioh. 21. 22. concerning Saint Iohn, what is that to thee? Vpon this was bruted the report, that the Euangelist should not die. Mistaking, both breeds and spreads misreports: if ignorantly, it is a pardonable error; if wilfully, it is a palpable dishonestie: which is the very case of this Iesuite heere. Hee hath laboured long to no purpose, to prooue his Maiestie a Persecutor; now out of the Kings owne words, he would faine make him a Blood-goloser: and to effect that, he turns a Gratious Premonition into an expresse Commination; a supposed occasion into a Positiue conclusion; a due punishment by Iustice, into Crueltie by Persecution; and the true cause, into a veile of pretence. For his Maiesties speech is this: It can neuer bee prooued that any are, or were put to death for case of Conscience, except that now this DISCHARGE giuen by the Pope, bee the CAVSE of the DVE punishment of many: which is as much as if his Maiestie should say, I am so farre from executing any for their Religion or Conscience, that I haue beene content to winke at their Breach of my Command, and their contempt of Law, assuring my selfe heeretofore of their Loyaltie: but now, if I, through fauour, suffer them in my Realme, and the POPE, by WARRANT, forbid them to giue mee securitie of my state,
                  
                  so that they shall neither yeeld Obedience to Statute, nor giue pledge of their Allegeance: If I be not secured, the Law shall be executed: who then cause that, and must answer for this blood but the Pope? whose Breues they now make the only Allegation for their refusall? Is not the Diuell therefore truly called the Murderer of mankinde, because by his insinuating dis

It concernes the Pollicie of the Land, and the Kings safety, to exact their Allegeance: it stands with their duty to performe it: they are willing, the Pope forbids them: their Refusall drawes on punishment for their former breach of Law: where's the cause?

In the Reuelation, the third Apoc, 8. 10. 11 part of the Waters became Worme-wood, and many men died of the Waters, because they were made Bitter: bitternesse caused death, but whence came the Bitternesse? from the STARRE that fell into the Waters, called by the name of WORMEWOOD: a perfect Resemblance of the Popes Breues: the Rebellious disloyaltie of the Catholikes hastned their ends; the Popes Breues nourisheth it in them, and hardneth them in it: there's the Colloquintida that hath brought death into the pot.
               192. His Comfort to the Catholikes followeth; First, in a generall Theoreme,
                   that no suffring is so honorable as that which commeth with a dishonorable title: So Christ suffered as a disloyall person and a deceiuer: So Paul as a disturber. First, that's not simply true; for the ignominy of the title ads nothing to the Honour of the passion, vnlesse the cause be goo

                     , and the party innocent, either from the iust imputation,
                  
or the violent presumption of deseruing that title; for good Subiects (like Casars wise) must bee carefull, not onely to bee free from the fact, but from the occasion also that might Sueton. Iul. giue suspition of the fact: and that was our Sauiours case, who both preached obedience to Caesar in his Doctrine, and performed it in paying Tribute.
               193. But what's this to the Catholikes? yes, saith hee, Mat. 22. & 17. (that's his particular comfort) They suffer for the false Imputation of Ciuill Disloyalty, whereas it is indeed for their Roligion and loyaltie to God their eternall Prince. This is that which they call in Schooles begging of the cause, Petitio principis; hee resumes the case which is in question betweene vs, fondly supposing that either the Statutes in that case are against Religion, which are for the Princes safetie, and the States securitie; or that the Oath impeacheth the Popes Spirituall iurisdiction; both which wee denie: and neither hee, nor any of theirs shall euer bee able to euict it, vnlesse they can prooue, that Lawes made to voide the Land of Seducers, and Seeds-men of Rebellion, be against Gods word: or that our Sauiour (with the Keyes) gaue authoritie to de-Throan and de-Crowne Princes, either directly or indirectly: which distinction, vnlesse it had beene better followed, and more substantially handled (saith Master Black-well) it had beene better that Bellarmine had neuer Confes. at large page 65. touch't it at all. What then may wee expect of this poore Atomite when he comes to the point? who can break no ground but with Bellarmines Heiffer: for if that Oracle faile in any substantial controuersie, he is one of the Sceriphian Frogges, clamorous in Inuectiues, (as they in Scyrus) in Plin. lib. 8. ca. 85. any sound point either dumbe or dull. And now it is like hee will come to that issue, in this second part of the Paragraph, as hee hath deuided it.

               2 For whereas his Maiestie presseth the point for triall, how the Pope can in Diuinitie iustifie that speech of his, that the OATH containeth many things PLAINELY AND DIRECTLY contrary to Faith and Saluation; he, Numb. 35. challengeth the King of an Iniurie in thrusting in the word directly.

Such an one, the Orator describes, Hic ille planus improbissimus, quastu nefario 
                  Cic. pro. Cluent 
                  pastus.
               
               3 In the very next Numb. preceding, this iangling Sophister had changed all the wordes of his Maiesties

speech, cleane contrary to the Kings meaning, as hath beene shewed; heere his Maiestie puts in but one Synonymum: which hoth in English and Latine, are vsually ioyned each with other; and this giues him to an exclamation of iniurie: he might as well haue blamed Tully for ioyning apertam, simplicem & directam to one and the same way of happinesse. De finib. lib. 1 But his Maiesties plain and direct dealing against al Calumniation is euident, in that he setteth down the Popes whole Breue, word for word both in Latine and English; whereby the Christian Reader may iudge that his Maiestie purposed not to take any aduantage vpon any Tearme, or tittle not there expressed.
               4 A second and greater Iniurie followes. His Maie stie vseth a sppeech which a Mahometan Philosopher vttered against Moses, and turnes it vpon the Pope 
                   (Tortus the Writhen 
                  Pa. 34. 
                  Cardinall, saith it was vttered against Christ:) but wherein lieth the Iniury, vnlesse it be in the application, that the Pope (an vsurping challenger, and only a Breue-compounder) should be match

                  Mythologies of Poets fables, and the morall vse of Apologues, applied both to the best sort of men, and the most eminent vertues.
               5 In Diuinitie, that speech of Saint Paule against the 1 Cor. 14. 36. insulting Pseud-Apostles; Came the word of God out from you; or came it vnto you onely? is the very same in effect which Z

                  thee? Or more plainely and directly, the same wordes which the Diuell vttered to Christ, What haue we to doe with thee?

                        •…
                     9. 
                  our Time is not yet. The very same (I say) our Sauiour vseth to his blessed Mother, Woman what haue I to doe with thee? 
                  Ioh. 2. 4. 
                  mine houre is not yet come. And I thinke there is no doubt

but that the same text of Scripture which the Tempter misapplied to the breaking of our Sauiours necke by presumption, may be Christianly applied to the comfort of a distressed soule in assurance of Gods prouidence. Math 4. &. Psal 91.
               
               6 If peraduenture the Apologier had not truely charged the Pope in that applied assertion, some might haue thought it a wrong, (or as this high-stiling Iesuite tearmes it) a more grosse point, and iniurious: but peruse the whole Breue, there appeares not one, either authority, or reason, brought to confirme his said bold Assertion; but as is hee were an Oracle, to Speake and away, as Saint Augustine said, Haec Manichaeus dixit & abiit, it not standing with the Popes irre
                        •…
                     ragabilitie to yeeld a reason of his conclusions: or as Gallen (whom Tortus in this place citeth for that speech of Auerroes) speaketh of such an other, hee 
                  
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   
                  deliuereth his Theorems so confidently, as if either hee had 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , a mouth that could not erre nor trip, or as if none were able or worthy to finde any probable contradiction against his speech.
               
               7 A third thing is an ABVSE offered by his Maieiestie to the words and meaning of the Breue; namely, that the King should charge the Pope, of new & vndiuinelike Doctrine, for saying that the OATH contained many things, apertly contrary to faith and saluation: as if thereby the Pope should say or meane, that naturall allegeance to their Soueraigne and King were directly opposite to Faith, and Saluation of Soules.
               
               8 His Maiestie (vnder Correction) hath done the Pope too much honour, in vouchsafeing an answere (especially with that iudgement) to such pelting stuffe of a WOFVLL Breue; wherein hee hath beene so sincere from detorting any thing, that the Pope could not haue met with any more Candide and Ingenuous writer: neither is it to be thought, that the High Priest himselfe, would haue vsed such a Sawcy tearme of ABVSE, as this rightly Male part, that is, Mis-begotten Catechresticall companion

hath done. But if it appeare that the Popes words imply so much, and that necessarily, Quid dabitur viro? what shal be done to him that knetcheth this opprobrious Curre? For what is this vncircumcised Iesuite, that hee should, in so base tearmes, scurrilize so great a King?
               9 This therefore is his Maiesties argument: Whosoeuer pronounceth THAT OATH VNLAWFVLL AND FLAT CONTRARY TO FAITH, which containeth nothing else in it, but an acknowledgment of all naturall and Ciuill Obedience, due by the Subiect to the Prince; hee broacheth a NEW, STRANGE, and VN-DIVINELIKE ASSERTION: but the Pope doth this, in pronouncing so of the Oath of Allegeance, which containeth in it nothing else: therefore, his Assertion is strange, vncoth, and dissonant from Diuinitie. Where's now the Rub? In the Minor perhaps; suppose it to be so: that's but a failing in the tearmes, no abuse to the person, no iniurie to the wordes; modesty would stay for the proofe, not hasten the doome, especially in such tearmes of Saucie Bitternesse. If therefore the Assumption had beene insisted vpon in the Consequence thereof (for therein is the Cardo and Marrow of the Question; scilicet, that the OATH containeth NOTHING in it but THAT which concernes Ciuill and naturall obedience) This had beene Scholler like, and Christian dealing, and to purpose: but the very wordes of the Oath it selfe, doe ratifie his Maiesties collection, and inference.
               10 For the Oath (as hath beene shewed) consisting of two parts, assertiue for the Kings Right to his Crownes and Kingdomes; and negatiue against any forraine challenger or Intruder whatsoeuer, or vnder any pretence whatsoeuer (for so the Oath doth manifestly diuide it selfe) his Maiesties Arguments then thus hold: First, THAT OATH, the positiue and exclusiue parts whereof doe not touch nor impeach any Spirituall Iurisdiction or Authoritie, directly or indirectly; containes nothing in it but matter concerning
                  
                  Ciuill Obedience; but neither of the parts in the OATH of allegeance doth so (for Deposing of Kings, or Absoluing Subiects from their dutie, or inciting Rebellions (forraine or domestike) comes not within the reach of Spirituall Iurisdiction) Ergo, &c.
               11 Secondly, nothing can be contrary to Faith and Saluation, but that which crosseth some point contained within, or grounded vpon the Articles of Faith, comprised in those Creedes which the Church hath allowed; the OATH of allegeance crosseth none of those, nor any part in them, vnlesse the Popes authority in Temporalibus be an Article of faith, and so bee referred to Ecclesiam Catholicam; but that cannot be: for among many other of their owne writers, their Arch-Priest refels (and repeates it often) that because the Church Letter to the Catholikes. hath not yet concluded it to be a point of Faith, whether hee hath any such authoritie or no; or (if hee haue) not determined how farre it stretcheth, if to Excommunication, yet not to Eradication (saith he) neither directly nor indirectly: (surely then not to Deposition from their Crownes, or Instigation to Rebellions:) Ergo, It crosseth no point of FAITH.
               12 And therefore his Maiestie said well, that the Pope had done honestly and discreetly, if he had put downe the speciall words, at which hee quarrelled in the OATH; and this Libeller had reuealed some sparkes of integritie, if hee had shewed one point soundly prooued, wherein it touched Macrobius de Le
                        •…
                     ulo. Sat. 2. 
                  Matter of Faith before he had fetcht vp his pinguem Saliuam out of his filthy throat, to cast an Aspersion of Abuse, Cauill, Calumniation,  and voluntary mistaking the question, vpon his Maiestie: For if there be any of these, it is in the Pope, who mistakes either the meaning of the Oath, or the Limits of his owne authoritie.
               13 His Maiestie is in the right: and the assertion which he gathereth out of the Popes words, that hee denieth the acknowledgement of Ciuill obedience, is no surmised principle, but a necessary Inference: as also the Examples, which

his Maiestie bringeth out of Scriptures, Fathers, and Councels, are most proper and direct to the purpose.
               14 The dilating and multitude whereof, vexeth this Epistler, and makes him, in scorne, first to call it a  Flourish. (So some did account that for the noise of a Thunder, 
                  Ioh. 12. 29. but a ratling in the aire with an vndistinct sound, which others acknowledged to be the voice of an Angell answerable to the occasion; and the Sword, placed at the entry of Paradice, appeared but a Flourish of a Blade, yet it Gen. 3. strooke a terror, and recordation of their former disloyaltie into our first parents; as these commemorated examples might into the hearts of Priests, and those Catholikes of their with held Obedience, were not their consciences seared, and by preiudice made vncapable of such tender Recognition.) But Dauid seemes a Fondling (saith S. Augustine:) To whom? To Achis: id est, Stultis & ignorantibus: to them, which themselues are both Fondlings and Aug. in Psal. 33. 
                  Rudesbies: and these authorities but a Flourish to a Superficiall Iesuite, that neuer could diue deepe for any learning.
               15 Secondly, hee tearmes it a Borrowed Discourse from THEIR Authors, because otherwise wee are drie and barren, if we say any thing which they doe not say:  witnesse that challenge which was neuer yet foiled nor answered, that for 600. yeeres after Christ, all the Scriptures, Fathers and Councels stand for our. Assertions; not One true, naturall, vncogg'd or vnadulterate, for any point then propounded, and Rome now maintaines against vs. Thirdlie,  
                     a Combat with a shadowe, because THEY are not aduerse to vs in the matter of Ciuill obedience. For first, THEY hold that Subiects must obey both good and badde Princes, in all things LAWFVLL. But who must iudge what's lawfull? The Apologue is knowen; if the Lion say the bunch of 
                     •…
                  sh in the forehead be an horne, though it be not so, 'twill be accounted so.
               16 Secondly, THEY teach that the Prince is to he
                     
                     obeied propter Conscientiam, yet not contra Conscientiam; for Conscience sake, not against Conscience.
                   That is no sound doctrine in the negatiue part; for euen against a mans Conscience, the Prince is to be obeied, vnlesse that he which disobeieth, can prooue his Conscience to be the same which 1. Tim 1. 9. the Apostle describeth; A good Conscience accompanied with true loue and faith vnfained; for there may be Asinina, and there may be Lupina Consciencia (it is the distiction of one of their great Martyrs, named by the Cardinall in his Letter:) Sir Tho. More consol

                     n Tribulat. some mans Conscience may be so steightned, that it will straine gnats, and make scruple of euery thing that is commanded; and another so vast, that he will deuoure whatsoeuer is enioined him.
               17 And this distinction meets with that vaine Challenge of his, which is the third thing he obiects:  Let them (saith he) shew but one onely authority, example, or testimonie out of Scripture, Fathers, or Councels, that Princes must be obeied against Conscience or Religion, and then wee will grant he speakes to the purpose. If he had said against Cōscience rightly instructed, and purely cleansed; and true Religion soundly warranted by Gods word, we contend it not, we cannot: We say with S. Augustine: Si aliud Deus, aliud Imperator iubeat, contempto hoc, obtemperandum est Deo. But seeing that Conscience may both Erre, and be polluted; and the Scripture insinuates, that there may be a vaine and Iac. 1. 26. 
                  defiled Religion; there is nothing more easie for proofe, or euident for demonstration, then that Obedience is to bee enioined euen against Conscience, if it be erroneous or Leaprous; and against Religion, if forged and fasly so called. For if knowledge (which is the ground of Conscience) may bee nick-named (as the Apostle tels vs it may) and so no knowledge 1. Tim. 6. 20. indeede; much more, both Conscience, which applieth that knowledge to particular acts; and Religion, which deriues out of that knowledge her supposed Theologicall Principles, may bee so: or else, both Heretikes and Schismatiques, who can, and doe plead Conscience for

their standing out, haue receiued great wrong from the Church of God.
               18 And therefore either the Pope, or this Proctor of his, should (if they were able) shew what that point is, one o
                     •…
                   moe, in the Oath, that is contrarie to a Good Conscience, and True Christian Religion; which because they neither haue, nor can, his Maiesties Conclusion is vncontroulable, that the Pope hath prohibited Catholikes, to performe euen Ciuill Obedience to their Soueraigne; and therein hath crossed both precepts and examples of Scriptures, Fathers, and Councels, touching that point.
               19 To the examination whereof, or some of them rather (for where hee cannot cauill, there hee suppresseth) this great Bible-Clerke vouchsafeth to condescend, Num. 30. His examination of the Scriptures consisteth, first, of an expunction: for the so most, which touch th the oint neerest, wherein the people professe their vnlimited Allegeance to Iosua, in ALL things to obey him, that's gone Iosh. 1. 17. into the Index Expurgatorius; such vn-confined and large Obedience to Princes, makes not for the Popes Triple Turbant. Secondly, of a  Concession: that he granteth the Examples which his Maiestie aleageth, of the Isralites obeying Nabucodonozor, Pharao, and Cyrus to bee true, because it was onely TEMPORALL Obedience which they exhibited. If by Temporall, hee meane concerning Matters meerely Temporall, hee abuseth the Reader; for they shewed their Obedience to bee due, and performed it in Matters of Spirituall Seruice; for to Offer Sacrifice vnto Exod. 5. 1. the Lord, by his owne appointment, and message deliuered to Moses their Superior Spirituall Gouernor (as this fellow cal-him Numb. 39.) vpon dread of danger, and punnishment for the neglect, is an high case of Conscience and Religion, yet would they not attempt it without asking and obtaining the Kings Leaue. So the Commandement of Cyrus was in a cause meerely Ecclesiasticall, viz. the building 
                  Verse 3. Ezr. 1. 2. 
                  of the Lords house at Ierusalem, and transporting thither

the consecrate Vessels, according as the Lord had commanded him: (for God puts the managing euen of Spirituall affaires vpon the Kings charge;)

                   without HIS license, the Isralites endeuoured not; but being appointed, they refused not.
               20 The third part of his Examination, is a Counterscarfe of Examples opposed against the Instances in the Apologie; some Canonicall, and those varying from the point; as that of the

                  meats which the Babilonians eat were prohibited; or, if not forbidden, yet were serued in, or eaten with certaine idolatrous Ceremonies, contrary to Gods word, as appeareth Dan. 5. 1. Dan. 1. 8. else-where in that Prophecie; for which cause the Holy Ghost doth call it a Pollution: and the same was Tobies case also for his abstinence. But if it were a ciuill duty, as being a matter of ordinary diet, then being commanded by the King) his disobedience had not beene iustifiable, vnlesse that first hee had obtained leaue of the Kings Chamberlaine, or maister of the houshold; and secondly, had by Prophecie foreseene Gods blessing vpon that his abstinence.

No. The Machabees for their refusing to eat, and circumcising their children against Antiochus command, had their double warrant from the 1. Macab 1. 65. &c. written word; the one for Ceremony, the other for a Sacrament: and the reason is yeelded in the Text, because they would not breake the HOLY COVENANT, they were put to death.

THIS Pope deales cleane contrary with the Oath, neither shewes his reasons of disallowing it, nor yet suffers it to passe for currant, but plainely forbids the taking of it; and yet saith this vaine Epistler▪ this example of Saint Gregorie makes flat for the Catholikes.
               30 The other interrogation concerning Saint Ambrose is, Whether, if the Emperor had offered him an OATH Repugnant to his Religion and Conscience, hee would haue taken it? to which, first he answereth both for himselfe and vs too, Surely no. And this also is

Surely no: for in as greate a point of Conscience as that, his answerwas, I haue done

Augustine; among which, if by the power of Sunne and Starres, an exhalation bee forced vp, and by coertion so streitned, that it cannot haue passage; by counterforce of both their strengths (the one impelling, the other resisting) the Cloudes breake into Thunder; yet that dreadfull noise ends in moisture and raine: Nam Deus fulgura ad pluuiam fecit, saith Saint Hierome; that is, (as they moralize it) Superiors

Ambrose: Thirdly, ouer-awed, at least misled by his mother a woman Heretically affected (and that Sex must predominate which way soeuer inclined:) fourthly, the conference must be in a publike consistorie, among a multitude of Iewes, Gentiles, and Heretikes, where he could expect no other issue but what the Apostles found, when they Act. 2. 13. spake with diuers ongus, Mocks, & Scoffes. For there are some places, not fit for Christians either their Actions or arguments Our Sauiour himselfe could doe no great miracle in his owne Country; not that hee was vnable for want 
                     Mar. 6. 5. Mat. 7. of power, but hee saw it was vn-auaileable through their lack of faith: and why should that holy Father cast his Pearles before swine?
               
               
                  
34 His reason of deniall was Diuine-like; deniall (I say) not of comming, for, Venissem, Imperator, ad Consistorium, saith Saint Ambrose, I had come, most noble Emperour, vnto the Consistory (according to the Summons) saue that the Bishops and people both with-held mee; but of disputing before the yong Emperor as a Iudge in causes of Faith, which might not be, the spirit of Prophets being subiect to the Prophets, by the Apostles rule. 1. Cor. 14. 32.
               
               35. May not then a Prince iudge in cases of Religion and Faith? No, not Iudicio definitiuo, to determine what is sound Diuinity or not, and so impose that vpon the consciences of men, for Faith, which HEE alone defines to beeso: but Iudicis exequntiuo or Iurisdictionis, he may and ought, when the Church hath determined matter of Faith, command the professing thereof within his Kingdome, as the soundest and worthiest to be receiued. For so some Schoole-men distinguish of Iudgement, making it, first twofold; Definitiue, to set down what is to be thought of each Occam. in Dialog. thing, and so prescribe it to mens beleefe (and that is the principall prerogatiue of God himselfe:) and Secondarily, of the Church representatiue, guiding her iudgement by Gods voice, which is his word: the other of recognition or sifting out the truth, which they make three-fold; either discretiue, to trie whether things either bee or bee not, or whether they bee that they seeme to bee (and that's common to all Christians, to trie the spirits, whether they bee of God or no:) or directiue, to lead others into a right iudgement, 1. Iohn 4. 1. by reuealing the Truth, and instructing them; which being a publik duty, is proper to the pastors of the Church: and thirdly decretiue, which is in the Prince, both affirmatiuely to binde those within his compasse (aswell Clergie as Laity) to the obseruing of that which is so tried and adiudged; and negatiuely to suppresse the Contrarie. This last, to iudge for the truth, Saint Ambrose denied not to the Emperor, yea it was his greefe that he did not so; but to iudge of a truth, whether it should bee so or no, as in this

verie case (being a high mysterie of Faith) Whether Christ should bee the Sonne of God or not? which God himselfe by his word had warranted, and the Church, by the assistance of his Spirit had alreadie determined and established: this (I say) he denied, especially to Valentinian, who wanted (as it seemed) those three qualities, which are principally required in iudgement: first, Authoritie, for it is the Churches Aquin. 22. q. 60. & 61. right to determine in matters of doctrine; secondly, Prudence, to which many yeeres are required, saith the Philosopher, but the Emperor was verie young, and a Nouice 
                  Arist. Ethic. l. 9 in the rudiments of Faith; thirdly, Iustice, which hath indifferencie euer annexed, and that in Valentinian was defectiue, who had forestalled the same with a partiall Law for the aduerse part, a strong barre against true iudgement; for men are hardly remooued from priuate opinions, much lesse Kings from their Lawes once published, especially in points of Diuinitie; because such Retractations will alwaies leaue an aspersion, either of Ignorance, Rashnes, or Inconstancie.
               
               36. His second and third Instances follow, as stale as the former: (for this fellow liues vpon Allens scraps)  
                     S. Ambrose denied to yeeld vp a Church at the Emperours command for the Arrians to assemble in: as also he refused to send the Consecrate Church-vessels to the Emperour, requiring them: and his reason for both was, Quaediuina, &c.

If, after that, vpon his importunitie, it pleased the Emperour to qualifie it, by giuing a more large scope to that monasticall desire, yet was not that yeelding of his, made so publike that all might take knowledge of it; but Gregorie is faine to make it good vpon his credit, in those words, in that Epistle which this Falsifying Iesuite mentioneth, but leaueth them out verie cunningly, [Mih

                     . l. 1. 
                  our gratious Emperour is so contented: (it seemeth then that they had read the Edict, and receiued it before vncorrected.)
               42. And is not this most properly applyed to his Maiesties purpose? that a Pope, though misliking a Law Ecclesiasticall, made without his priuitie and consent, should not take any publike exception against it, but priuately by Letters; not prohibit any to obey it, but make meanes to the Emperours attendants for mitigation thereof; and in the meane time publish it PRESENTLY vpon the Mandate, as it was sent vnto him? If the Pope had reuealed vnto his Catholikes the vnlawfulnesse of the OATH, and yet willed them, for conscience to God, and in duetie

to their Prince, to take it, and in the meane time promise that hee would indeuour by intercession and mediation to the Kings Maiestie, either to mitigate or abrogate the Law, then had he beene more like Gregorie, and yet the example make nothing for the Pope or his Catholikes; sor Gregorie excepted priuately against the Law, but obeied the commandement for publishing it; the Pope openly interdicteth; they obstinately refuse taking of the OATH. The truth is, the submissiue carriage of that Pope to the Emperour, both in his stile and deportment, doth so plunge the great Bellar. de Pontis. Rom. lib 2. ca. 28. debater of Controuersies, that like one foundred, hee knowes not whether hee should ascribe it to Gregory his humilitie or necessitie: and so maketh their great Sainted Pope, either an Hypocrite, to giue the Emperor an Haile Master, (whom in heart hee contemned, yea, accounted a Persecutor, saith Parsons) or else a temporizing luke-warme Laodicaan, that for feare or constraint would yeeld to any Num. 49. thing against his conscience, that the Emperour should command.
               43. The Councels follow; and not onely that of Arles in France, with fiue other at least (which submitted themselues wholly to the Emperour Charles the great in most humble tearmes) but the foure generall Councels (which Gregorie compares to the foure Euangelists) summoned at the becke and command of the Emperors, and submitted (for the validity and establishment of their decrees) to their most royall assent: and yet all this is nothing to the purpose, saith this Antapologer.
               
               44 No? If whole Councels submitted themselues in all dutiull reuerence to their Souereignes, not only in matter of Temporall Affaire, but of Faith and Religion; then doth the Pope an il Office, and vn-priest like, in forbidding the Kings naturall Subiects to acknowledge their allegeance to him in Ciuill right. It is euen the like argument which God himselfe vseth in way of Complaint, by comparison, the SONNES OF IONAD AB Rechabs

               50 Or was this Submission, or rather remission by the

Synod, made, because this Councell was assembled ONLY for reformance of MANERS? that is his last interrogatory and answered by him affirmatiuely; Yea for after the first Canon, which containes a prosession of their Faith, the other twentie fiue (being in all but twenty sixe) are about Reformation of matters amisse; and so hee reckons vp eleuen of the twenty fiue. Genebrard indeed doth call all those Synods by Charles the Great assembled, CONCILIA 
                  Chron. lib. 4. Anno 813. 
                  REFORMATORIA. Belike then it is granced, that Princes within their seueral Dominious, may assemble their Clergie concerning matters of Ecclesiasticall Discipline, and that is NERVVSECCLESIAE; matters of Faith haue a great Dependance vpon that Reformation; because vnsoundnesse in opinions, is seldome separate from dissolutenes of Manners.
               51 But was the assembly only for that? first then, the Clergie did aliudagere, and went beyond their commission, for after their mutuall Salutations and Ioy at each others meeting, Coepit vnionis nostrae numerositas de Rebus spiritualibus 
                  Praesat. ad Consil. 
                  mutua Collatione inter se ora diffundere, our whole company beganne to conferre at large about matters Spirituall, say the Fathers of that Councell. Secondly, the eleuenth Canon defineth who are to be accounted 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , and within what degree of Consanguinity they are comprised; & that (I trow) is a matter of Dostrine: yea, and the eight Canon (which in the Margin the Iesuite hath marked, but omitted in the body of the discourse) is by their owne rule a matter of Faith, and Religion, & by this Epistler termed Nomb. 50. 
                  a point of the Law of God, namely the Prohibition of entring into Monastical life. Mauritius in his Edict forbad that Souldiers should be admitted as Monks, & that by Greg. the great is accounted such a matter of conscience & Religiō
                   that he takes it to be against God himself, & to be a mandate preclusory of the way to heauen: the said very restr. int, for Vbi supra. Nunnes and Monks is within this Councel, & yet now it is reputed but a matter of manners. The 18. Canon not

only concludeth the Crism. to be safely kept vnder lock & key, but determines it to be Genus Sacramenti, a kind of Sacramēt, & therfore not to be touched by any but Priests.
               52 Yet grant it were so, that this Councell were onely assembled to correct deformitie in manners, did they then by their submission acknowledge the Emperors authoritie Onely in those Cases, and not in matters of Faith and Religion? What can we say to the foure Generall Councels (specified by his Maiestie) assembled by the Emperor, and particularly that of Ephesus against Nestorius, summoned by the Emperor, and after many earnest supplications and interceptions of their Letters, and hard pressures vpon some Orthodox Fathers, (for Cyril and Memmon vpon sinister Tom. 2. Concil. per Binium. p. 921. Informations were laid fast) their Decrees were at last confirmed by the Emperors authoritie? His answer is, Numb. 55. Those ONLY tend to prooue TEMPORALL Obedience and therefore hee will not stand to examine them. Very learnedly spoken, and very honestly, no doubt.

                  t that the vnderstanding did it; when as in all other things hee would make anything the cause rather then it. Heere Temporall Obedience is made the cause of the Councels submission, (which saith the Iesuite,
                   wee offer most willingly)  when as those Synods were not assembled for any one such point; and hee with his are ready to performe nothing lesse. And so passing them with silence, because he knowes not what to say vnto them, he tels vs
that he will draw to an end of this Paragraph. Wherein, like Schole-boies, when they haue spent their questions, hee fals on rayling against the Apologier with his Saucie tearmes.
               54 And why so? Because his Maiestie professed, that it neuer came within His reading, that Temporall Obedience was against Faith, and Saluation of Soules. Sure he was, that Christ professed himselfe of another opinion, in denying his kingdome to be of this world, and in commanding Ioh. 18, 36. Matth. 21. 21. 
                  Caesars right to be giuen vnto Caesar; and therefore if the Pope had once set it downe as an Article of Faith, (for he hath a tricke by the infallibility of his spirit to make NEW ARTICLES at his pleasure) before he had thus pronounc't of the Oath of Alleagiance, it had beene more excusable.
               55 Vpon this the Iesuite resulteth in a kinde of Tertullus rhetoricke, with a volume of empty and hauty words, calling this speech

It forbids the Oath wherein is Onely acknowledgement of Ciuill Alleageance; and he which Prohibits the Swearing against an Vsurping Deposer, denies Temporall Obedience to the rightfull Soueraigne.

               59 From this his Maiesties Prolemma and anticipating conclusiō, the Epistler comes to answer this Dilemma that is, If Temporall Obedience be lawfull, the Pope is iniurious to forbid it to his Catholikes; if it be vnlawfull, yet is hee vniust to condemne, and not to shew the reason. Both these PILLERS (as the Iesuite cals them) like another Sampson, he sets his force to frush at once, and yet (they standing) himselfe is crushed with his own shock. For what he hath hitherto laboured to confute, and now againe peremptorily denieth, (scilicet, 
                     That the Breue gainsa
                           •…
                        th not obedience in Ciuill things)
                    in answere to the last part of the Dilemma, he plainely confesseth and gran teth: for the Pope being iustly taxed by his Maiesty for not expressing any cause or reason of the vnlawfulnesse of the OATH,  the Epistler saith, There are as many reasons that it is vnlawfull, as there are POINTS in the OATH which concerne Religion:  And there is no one
                  
                  point but doth so, euen that very first Article which meerly toucheth Ciuill Obedience, I doe sweare before God, that King lames is the lawfull King of this Realme, &c. for euery Subiect is by Religion in conscience bound (if he be required) to sweare vnto the lawfull right of his true Souereigne. And therefore the Pope, by this Antapologers grant, not distinguishing the parts, but laying down the whole Oath in a lumpe, as a sufficient reason of the vnlawfulnesse, denieth euen Ciuill Obedience, and Recognition to be acknowledged by his Catholikes vnto their Lord and King.
               60 But perhaps by Religion he meaneth the points of the Oath, where the Pope and Church of Rome is named; it had then been honest dealing in the Pope, first, to haue said so, and then to haue shewed what foundation that, Religion hath which giueth him such power to depose Kings, or absolue Subiects; and to haue made that point soundly good for himselfe, before he had rushed into such a peremptory Prohibition: but that being yet a debate-able ground, and a Controuersie not agreed vpon amongst his own Professors, nor determined by his Cathedral autliority, it was an hasty rashnes, not vpright iustice, to award a sentence so resolutely Interdictiue. For though a Iudge disputeth not, but determineth,  (as saith this Iesuite) yet it is a Iudges part to guide his determination by the allegations and proofes made on both sides, in the hearing of the parties, if it be possible; if not, yet to intimate the reasons of his so sentencing; which otherwise, euen a Pagan thought to be an absurd, yea a brutish course. For he which giueth a definitiue Sentence, hearing but one party, Aequum

                  licet statuerit, hand aequus fuit; though his determination were iust, his proceeding was vniust, saith the Philosopher. In the Pope then there was a double iniustice; first, to iudge in Seneca. the absence of one side; secondly, (suppose they say that the Oath it selfe serued as the aduerse party present) that 
                     •…
                  so is iniustice to condemne the good with the bad; for eyther Gen. 18.
                  
but some part of the Oath concernes Temporall Obedience, (that Parsons confesseth) and then hath the Pope dealt both vniustly to condemne the whole Oath as it lieth; and vndiscreetly and iniuriously, not to expresse the particles of his exception: or else the whole Oath doth onely concerne it, and then is the Popes dealing both aberrant from Diuinity, and cruell to his Catholikes, forcing their Souereignes sword out of his scaberd, and whetting it in his hand against them; as also (which his Maiesty very iudiciously collecteth) by exhorting them to constancy not to yeeld therein, he casteth a foule imputation vpon that Religion, as if It and Ciuill Obedience were incompatible in themselues, and that no zealous Papist could be a true Subiect to his Souereigne.
               61 This Collection he tearmeth an Iniurious Inference; but answereth no other way, then first by a shifting comparison, 
                     that the same Obiection might be made against Saint Cyprian and other Fathers, for exhorting Martyrs to Constancie, not to yeelde against their Conscience; and secondly by a preoccupation, that if we should replie, that the things then exacted by Emperours, were simply and apparantly vnlawfull, these not; their answer is, that vnto them in their Consciences, the Oath is as vtterly vnlawfull:
                    which is as much to say, to sweare allegeance vnto their naturall and rightfull Souereigne, is in their Conscience as vnlawfull as to Sacrifice to Idols; for in deniall thereof onely, was the Constancie of those Martyrs tried, whom S. Cyprian hartned, as in the very booke which he quoteth is manifest, Exhort. ad Martyres. diuided into twelue Chapters; sixe of them, all handling that only argument as the subiect of their perseuerance.
               Thirdly, he answers by an Expostulation:
                   Why should it be more indispensable to deliuer vp a Bible or a New Testament, which the Martyrs then denied to the Emperours, and so died for denying it, and are by the Church commended for so dying, then now for Romes Catholikes to sweare an Oath against their Conscience when the King exacteth it?
               
               
                  
62. The reply is, first, that it is not the substance of the OATH that sticketh in their Consciences, but the forme thereof, especially those last wordes, I doe make this Recognition WILLINGLY and TRVLY: otherwise they haue a tricke in their Religion to swallow the whole Oath without straining; for this is their doctrine (and 'tis worth the obseruing) that if a man be called to sweare, if he take the Oath vnwillingly, 'tis vnto him as if hee had not Azor.

               63. Secondly, that this is (as the Schoolemen speake) Comparatio non aequalitatis, but similitudinis: for there is no proportion in these cases of Disobedience; because simply to deliuer vp a Bible vnto a Superior requiring it, is no sinne, yea, to denie it, is a contempt; for so farre foorth as they are materiall bookes, they are but Opera deletiua, (as Victor in August. speaketh) and, after deliuery, may either bee transcribed by Copy, or recouered by intreaty, or supplied from other places: but if the Emperor require them to vse as Iehoiakim did Ieremiah his prophecie; or Antiochus

Vnlesse hee had a warrant vnder the Popes Seale, to falsifie that little Reading hee hath, hee would not thus write; the Authors which he nameth, mention no such thing; vea, the contrary is implied by them. For not onely the Bible; but paper Bookes also of collected notes, and bookes of Phisicke were exacted to the fire, as in Saint August appeareth: yea some of Tully his works (as Arnobius witnesseth) euen as Numa Pompilius his volumes Contra.

Secondly, it was the current opinion in those times, as witnesseth Arnobius, that our Sauiour Christ was Magus insignis, a notable Sorcerer and coniurer; and so the New Testament was fetch't in, and whatsoeuer writings concerned HIM, as reckned in the number of Magicall bookes.

               67 Some shadow hereof (to goe no further) may be seene by this Iesuite in the point of these two Breues of Clement, the 8. in this place mentioned by his Maiestie, which Garnet the Arch-Traitor had, and burnt, & wherwith the Epistler makes the way to end this Paragraph (for Tortus pag. 46 li. 5. as concerning Rome being Babylon, he speaks not a word, as by silence granting that which Cardinal Mathew plainly acknowledgeth, and confesseth it to be euen that Babylon in the Apocalips.) Now then his Maiestie (who hath good reason to know what concernes matter of State) affirmes that those Breues, were sent by Pope Clemens octauus immediatly before the late Queenes death. This the Antapologer concludes to be an Exaggerated Calumniation. The Tortuse in Latin saith it is a vanity and falsitie: belike Pag. 45. li. 24 these men stand vpon a sure groūd, they are so cōfident: what's then the proofe? the English Iesuite saith, 
                     That hauing procured knowledge of the two BREVES, hee finds them sent into England, not together, nor immediately before the Queenes death, but the ONEDIVERS YERES BEFORE, Anno 1600. & the OTHER AFTER HER DEATH. 1603.The Vn-Iesuited Latinist,

68 If the date thereof must determine the truth, why agree they not vpon it? but suppose they did, that must not carrieit, it being an easie matter for the Pope to make an ante-date. The Gibeonites came to Iosua like far-went Trauellers, when as they were his confining neighbors; Iosu. 9. 12, 13. and with torne cloathes and mouldy victuals, as become so by iourneying, which they had made by craft: and the Breues of the newest coine may easily haue an olde stampe in the Popesmint, to make them currant for his Catholik purpose. They writ of Asia, that the want of one dipthong▪ 
                  Plut de dysop. Luc. 16. was the ouerthrow of the whole Countrie. The Pope is not so nice, to hazard his case vpon such quillits; if adding or altering, or falsifying, or out-facing will doe it, in wordes, sentences, or volumes, his Scribe is at hand, (like the honest Steward that can write down 50. or 80.) it is but turning a figure into a Cipher, and 600. will easily Apul.

But it is more then probable by that which this Epistler confesseth, that vpon report of the Queenes dispaired recouerie, both the Breues were drawn according to the Prouerbe, à Dorio ad Phrygium of two diuers natures, the One to raise a Tumult, if they found any head to make a foule stoppage against the King; if not, but that (in despight of the Deuil) the King should haue his Right, and the state be once setled, then the other should start out, to make a faire shew for the Pope, and some way for a tolleration.

His Tule was not so weake, that he needed the Popes furtherance, nor his desire of a crown so ambitious, that for atchieuing it he would betray his conscience: which the Pope knew, and his Maiestie should haue felt the smart therof, had the Catholike party bin strong enough: and therefore that other ground of the Popes, which the Epistler

Humilitie inforceth Praiers into the Clouds, to be returned Gen. 4.

In particular controuersies of Fact, there is no doubt but the Pope may erre: saith Bellar. yea, euen in points of Faith, saith Alphonsus in his last Edition, though corrected. Our Sauiour then concludes, If the blind leade the blinde, the danger of the Pit-fall is equall to them both.
               
               81 This Controuersie therefore, whether of Fact, or Faith, rests not there: but least it might be thought that the Oath was ouerswaied by the Popes authority, without ground of learning; or was interdicted, either vpon passion (without deliberate iudgement,) or vppon ambitious maintenance of the See Apostlolike (without weight of Argument); to strike that stroake deade, out-steps Cardinall Bellarmine, a ready armed Champion in HIS behalfe, whose successor (perhaps) hee hopes to bee; and by a LETTER to the Arch-priest Black-welll (as by his Gantlet cast) he challengeth the Oath of Atheisme, and him of Apostacy for taking it. And now according to the Prouerb, Res redijt ad Triarios: for this is HE, in whome lyeth their maine strength and hope. For Baronius compares his bookes to Dauids tower & Armorie

            THIRD PARAGRAPH.
            Intituled ABOVT Cardinall Bellarmines Letter, and answere thereto by the Apologer.
            
            
               Numb. 1. As if the Apologers answere like Ierichoes wals should presently fall with the Blast of a Rams horne, and Iosh. 6. 15. a few turnes About it: and yet is the Title well fitting his reply; for many windings and turnings he hath in a Preface ABOVT it, before hee come to it; and being in it, he treades a Labyrinth and somtimes looseth himselfe: and yet in the conclusion he windes his Cornet in three seuerall blasts; first, COMMINATORIE to our state; Secondly, CAVSATIVE of his Antapologie; Thirdly, SVPPLICATORIE, for a more moderate proceeding. In the Preface, after he hath first shewed the occasion impulsiue of Bellarmines writing; 
                     scilicet, a Forreigne mislike of Black-wells taking the OATH though with a limitation; and a scandall conioyned, in regard of his person and place:
                   (the Catholikes of our Clymate, as this Iesuite confesseth, were of another minde, so full of concord they are betweene themselues:) hee, secondly, summeth Supra. nom. 14. par. 1. vp as in one Totall the Particulars in the Cardinals Letter; yet neither like a Logitian, nor a good Auditor: but (as if a false borrower should summe vp the interest without the Principall) he leaues out the Essential & kindly parts thereof, and onely takes those that are consectarie and dependent, and those very simply and rudely.
               
                  
2 As thus, The Cardinall (saith he) shewes his opinion consisting of two points; the one, that the OATH as it stands compounded could not bee taken; the other that the Arch-Priest ought to stand firme in regard of his place, in defiance of danger. Whereas to make Bellarmine speake himselfe, the true Analysis is this: the Cardinals whole Letter (after the Gratulatorie Preface) is exhortatorie to Blackwell; first, to rectifie his iudgement in the true vnderstanding of the Oath; Secondly, to recouer his Constancy, which he hath lost in taking of it: the first he perswadeth by reason; because either openly or priuately it impugneth the Faith touching the Primacie of the See Apostolike; which is slenderly prooued, and falsly grounded: His first proofe, a slie anticipation, that the Oath implieth more feare then danger; Secondly, a false lustre, that it is like the mixture of Iulians pictures. His false ground, that the Oath impugneth the Spiritual Primacy of the See Apostolik, which is vtterly vntrue: and set vpon that Sandy and vnsound foundation, his whole building is placed, and so the standing thereof is prefigured in the Gospell. This is the true Analysis of the first part of the Letter; the second is vntouch't, Mat. 7. 27. and so let it lie.
               3 And as he hath summed it vp fondly, so falsly also; this Epistler saith, that 
                     Bellarmine taketh the OATH to be compounded of lawfull and vnlawfull clauses,
                    whereas the Cardinall saith plainly, that the OATH though it be so Apolog. p. 39. 30

                  pt Horat. Tpist. and a knottie point or two troubles him, before he can ioyne issue; The first, is the Wrong Translation of the Cardinalls Subscription, which the Apologer had thus metaphras'd, YOVR VERY REVEREND BROTHER;

                     
                     whereas those words (saith the Epistler are to bee referred to the Arch-Priest, and not to the Cardinall:
                    and this (in his pang) hee cals a CAVILL, both in the Corps and in the Margin.
               
               4 So the Moralist writes of a quicke sighted Empericke, that would perforce make a gentleman beleeue he was inclinable to a great sicknesse, because he saw reduuiam a pimple or the skin rising below his naile. But suppose Plutar. it were not exactly translated; first, is not the sense al one? for both the Brotherhood and Reuerence is Reciprocall and may be referred to both parties, either your Reuerendships Brother, or your Reuerend Brother, especially as it was in the written Copie, where the D. in the ende had such a dash, as it might bee taken aswell for dus, as dae. Secondly, why did not the Epistler mend it, and translate it right himselfe? because hee is apposed. For should hee haue intrepreted Dominationis in English truly adverbum, the reply (he fore-saw) would haue beene vppon him as Alexanders was vpon Diogenes, who begging a Tallent, the Emperor answer it was to much for a Cynike 
                  Diog. Luert. to aske; hee then craued an halfe-penny, the Emperor told him it was to little for Alexander to giue. Had it bin translated your Reuerend Lordships, that were to lofty a title for the Grand Cardinall to giue an Arch-Priest, whome the Canonists (some of them) make but a Rurall Deane, others Glos. dist. 50. in Capite.

                  Parag. 1. an vnmanerly part, euen in the King himselfe.
               5 But why should hee call it a Cauill? was any argument framed out of it; or the Cardinals ambition aggrauated, for so stiling himselfe? no such thing; onely translated and so left: the Latin is extant and vnaltered; and

in BLACKWELS Examination at large, translated Your Reuerend Lordships Brother. Whether properly in the one or the other, is it not truely both a quarrell De Asini

                     ra, who should haue the Lordship, either the Cardinall or the Arch-Priest? and an abuse of the Reader, to withhold him from serious matters, with trifles and gew-gawes? The other point is the Apologers wilfull mistaking of the question, and thereby a great ADVANTAGE giuen to the Cardinall for his defense. That yet sub Marte; and let not him that is girt to the battle, boast as he thats vnbuckled from the fight. If it be so, that neede not then haue stopt him; the more aduantage, the easier Conquest: the triall will shew it, and vpon that let it rest.
               6 And now these twinges are past, he comes, Numb. 4. to the first exception taken against the Cardinalls Letter, confessed by him to bee great if true, that Bellarmine hath mistaken the Question, and like a man blindfold, hath impugned the OATH OF SVPREMACY instead of the OATH OF ALLEGEANCE. And so much doth M. Blackwell confesse, after hee had well read and weighed the saide Letter, in saying, that hee perceiued 
                  Examin. large pag. 12. 
                  the Cardinall did not distinguish betweene those TWO Oathes, that of 1o. 
                  Elizabethae, and this of 3o. 
                  Iacobi. But Bellarmine hath himselfe preuented that Obiection (saith this Iesuite) in that he speaketh of an OATH TEMPERED AND MODIFIED, which cannot bee vnderstood 
                        •…
                     f any other but THIS OATH; THAT of the SVPREMACIE hath no such MIXTVRE in it: and this he cals a cleere Refutation.
               
               7 Which is indeed but a duskish illusiion; for, first, if this Oath be so modified in comparison of the other; why is IT accounted by this Censurer, the greatest affliction and pressure that euer befell the Catholikes? And why should not Paragr. 1. no. 33. pag. 20. an OATH, so allaied and tempered, be as readily entertained by the Pope and his followers, as was the Edict of Mauritius the Emperor, by their owne confession, after

it was corrected and moderated, as they say? Secondly, those Parag. 2. no. 49 
                  Mitigations and alleuiating Temperatures, being not mentioned by the Cardinall, argue rather that he did verily mistake the Oath; writing vpon other mens relations, not his owne vnderstanding and iudgement: for he that compares the Oaths; shall finde this last of Allegeance, to bee more pressing, pithy, and peremptory against the Popes Primacie in Temporalibus, then the other against his Spirituall Supremacie; and in all circumstances a more exact and searching touch-stone, to try and discouer a loyally-affected Subiect, from a hollow-hearted Recusant. Thirdly therefore, the Modification which the Cardinall speakes of (as by the verbe & tense he vseth [offerebatur] may well bee coniectured) is not in the tenor of the Oath passed so by the State, which still remaines as it did; but in the Offer of the Magistrate, when Blackwel took it not long before, whereof himselfe speaketh in his Letter to the Priests 
                  Exam. breuis, pag. 23. lin. 3. and repeats it againe in his Letter to the Cardinall, at those words, Qrod ad Iuramentum, &c. the first of which Resp. ad Bellar. lin. 12. 
                  Letters being written in the midst of Iuly, & Bellarmine dating his not till the end of September following; to that offred Temperature and acceptation there specified by the Arch-Priest, it is more probable that the Cardinall alludeth, then to the Oath it selfe, wherein there is no one quallifying point. So that his Maiesties exception that the Cardinall hath mistaken the Oath, remaines yet vnremooued, for all this Cleere Refutation; vnlesse hee bring more euidence, which he intends.
               8. But soft, the giddy fellow tels vs he hath another errand to doe, not out of the way, but a note BY THE WAY:  The Scripture sets a more essentiall Note vpon such By way takers, Operantes iniqiutatem, declinant in

                     Sueton. hath taken off the right HEAD and put another in the place thereof, in setting downe the forme of the OATH OF SUPREMACIE; For whereas in the times of King Henry the 8▪ and King Edward the sixt, The Title was then, The Kings Highnesse is the Supreme HEAD, the Apologer thinketh it not good to giue IT vnto his Maiestie; but calleth HIM only supreame GOUERNOR.
               
               9. Questionlesse, either a bold ouersight in his Maiestie, that he durst change a borrowed Metaphor into a proper word, or an ouer-awed feare to take that Title of Head into his stile, which God himselfe giues to a lesse and a farre worse King, and the Apostle to euery married 1 Sam. 15. 1. Cor. 11: man, whom he calleth the womans Head. But what's the Ulcer that vexeth him for this alteration? Perhaps because the first which gaue that Title of Supreame Head vnto King Henry the 8. were Bishops of their owne Profession, Stat. 26. c. 1. Hen. 8. not of ours, and so it was, as appeareth in that Statute which hee mentioneth: If so; why was it then accounted such a Sacriledge and Blasphemy of ours, as in all their writings it is continually traduced? Or is it because the Title of GOUERNOR hath more in it, or is a loftier and prouder Stile then HEAD? No: themselues confesse it is all one to be Head of the Church, and to bee chiefe Gouernour

For so it was, in the first yeer of the late Queene of famous memory, explaned rather then altered, at the request of the Nobles & Diumes of the Land and expressed, not by the wordes of Supreme GOUERNESSE, (as this Mate scornefully speaketh, and falsly laies it vpon M.

Neither did she take vpon her to speake in the Church, that is, to desine matters of Faith, administer the Sacraments, ordaine or consecrate (as Oziah once sacrificed, and as some 2. Par. 26. 16. Romish slanderers haue written) nor medled Shee with Church-matters more then Scriptures gaucher leaue by the place She had, nor was her authority in Ecclesiasticall causes any thing amoindred or made lesse by that change, or rather Explanation of Head into Gouernor, which (as before is said) the Romanists thēselues confesse to be all one thing; but onely to preuent or auoid a scandall, which (through ignorance) might be taken at it; least weaker mindes should thinke we gaue vnto our Kings that Title Secundum interiorem influxum, which is the proper office of the Head, as being the fountaine of moisture, and is the Arist. de somn. & Vigil.

Because, saith he, whereas in HEAD was included a Supremacie in causes Ecclesiasticall, by GOVERNOR, perhaps, they meane the Kings authority within his Realmes ouer all persons spirituall, but it matters ONLY Temporall; for S.

                  , now going on his Way, now stepping by the way, now returning, and In Parmenide anon gone againe. Well then, Let's returne now (saith hee) to that charge of grosse mistaking, laid by the Apologer to the Cardinall, for giuing the Childe a wrong name; which, besides the former mention of the MODIFICATIONS, and couching of lawfull and vnlawfull Clause in the OATH, the Cardinall doth also confute those MODIFICATIONS, in saying that they are but the SLEIGHTS OF SATAN to impugne the PRIMACIE of the See Apostolike, either SECRETLY or OPENLY; which argueth that the Cardinall aimed at both the OATHS.
                    
               
               
                  
13 First, can a man confute that which he neuer mentioneth, nor pointeth at, nor can finde? Or secondly, is this a good Argument, The Cardinall saith, that such Modifications as these in this Oath, doe impugne the Faith touching the Primicie, either secretly or openly: Ergo, He hath relatiō vnto two Oathes, the one secretly impugning the other openly? Is it not as strong a consequent, our Sauiour in the Gospel speakes of a Iudge, that neither feared God, nor reuerenced man: Ergo, Hee had relation to two Iudges, the one not fearing God, the other not regarding Luc. 18. man? But be it so; Then both the OATHS (belike, by this Iesuite) haue their Modifications; though the one more close, the other more ouert: which is a plain Contra diction to his first argument; for there he said, that Bellarmine must needes meane this OATH OF ALLEGEANCE, and no other, because THIS onely hath these Modifications, the other of the Supremacie hath none. Heere he insinuateth, that both of them haue their mixtures, the one more secret, the other more reuealed. Thus is the Antopolog
                        •…
                     r become Turn-sicke in troubling his little wit more then he need, to free the Cardinall from that imputation, which honestly he cannot.
               14 For certaine it is, that Bellarmine in that his dismaying Inuectiue (rather then Letter) vnto the Arch-Priest, hath played the Andabata, or blind-fold Fencer, committing three grosse ouersights therein: First, in that either he through ignorance wist not, or in his pollicie would not see a difference betwixt those two Oaths: Secondly, in that he discouereth not those subtile stratagems (as he calleth the Modifications heere specified) but in generall tearmes saith they do impugne the Primacie, either closely or openly: Thirdly, that all his Arguments & Authorities brought, are touching the Spirituall Supremacy, not one of them concerning the Temporal, which the Oath of Allegeance doth only impeach and encounter. So that his whole Epistle is the same which they cal Rhetorica He
                  
                  terogenea, a good speech if it had beene to purpose: for there is not any one part of the Popes Spirituall Supremacy touch't, or aim'd at in this last Oath.
               
               15 Had the Cardinall therefore either meant the right Oath, or intended a direct confutation thereof, his Argument should thus haue beene framed; That OATH which either secretly or openly shooteth at the Popes Primacy in Temporalibus, cannot be taken without endamaging the Catholike Faith, and His Conscience that taketh it; But this Oath of Allegeance doth impugne His Primacie in Temporalibus, ei ther secretly or openly: Therefore this Oath cannot be taken without a double dammage. Had he thus reasoned, his Maior Proposition should haue been 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , and his whole Epistle to Blackwell been bestowed in plaine and effectuall proofes, that the Crossing of the Popes Primacie in T

                  MPORALL GOVERNMENT ouer all Christned Kings, is the ouerthrow of the Catholike Faith, and of true Religion. Which Conclusion, as it would haue made his brains to sweat, before he could haue gotten any shew of proofe for it; so it would haue made both him, and his Religion odious and hateful to al the Kings & good subiects in Christendome: which he knew wel enough, and therfore voluntarily did mistake the Question, and turn'd all his force to support the Popes Spirituall Supremacy, which is not touch't in one point of t

                  is Oath
               
               16 Which, because his Maiesty in the Apology auerreth, this Iesuite maketh him to bee 
                     Contradictory and aduersary to himselfe for so saying, and that in the very next period, where deuiding the OATH into 14. particles, 12. of them at least (saith this Epistler) doe impugne the Popes spiritual supremacy.
                   It appeares then there are at most but two of those lawful and allowed clauses in the Oath, if ther be so many; and those Modifications (whereof he speakes) very few, euen one in al, as appeareth, Num. 10. Namely the first, I doe truely acknowledge that our Souereigne Lord King Iames is lawfull King of this Realme; which is the same

almost verbaum with the first clause in the Oath of Supremacie: so that either one and the same modification is in both OATHES (and then this Censur

                     STICE, as his Maiestie wel obserueth because in aduising the refusall of the whole Body of the Oath, as it is conceiued, & impugning the same, as Wholly vnlawfull, hee makes those that beleeue him, to fall into Rebellious conclusions; for he that shall refuse to take it, must needes hold the negatiue to those foureteene propositions: because all Refusall is either of wilfull obstinacie, or of a perswaded contrariety, as first, That our Souereign lord King Iames is NOT the lawfull King of this Realme; Secondly, That the Pope HATH power to Depose him; and so of the rest.
               
               17 And this the Iesuite S
                        •…
                     reth at: (in the meane time whats become of the Apologers contradiction; and the ouerthrow which his Maiestie hath giuen himselfe? THAT hee is not yet ready for; hee craues a respite to a further examination. Numb. 8.) 
                     but this (saith hee) is a simple Fallacie, called by the Logitians à composito ad diuisa, from denying of a Compound to inferre a deniall of all the parcels therein contained; which hee exemplifieth in an OATH framed either by some Platonist in magnifying his Master, or by an Arrian, or Pelagian Prince in fauour of their Sect: and both the OATHES mingled with clauses, some LAWFVLL, some VNLAWFVLL.  Wherein first, secretly hee girds at his Maiestie for beeing both a Philosopher (which is his Maiesties great glory, & our Realmes happinesse; for true Philosophie ioyned to Gouernement, regulates the Scepter to the Subiects comfort, and the Kingdomes renowne) and an Heretike also, Tortus saith so plainely: a perfect slaunder in them both: for by that Religion which they cal Heresie, he doth truely glorifie the God of heauen.
               
                  
18 Secondly, this challenge of Sophisticall arguing is more then a Fallacie, it is a Falsitie. For thus his Maiestie argueth: He that refuseth the whole body of the OATH, not distinguishing, nor declaring his allowance of some parts thereof, by this his UN-DISTINCT REFVSAL concludeth the vnlawfulnesse of the WHOLE, and is presumed to holde that the Contrary assertions are true; but the Cardinall condemnes the WHOLE OATH, as it is conceiued, not excepting any ONE for a lawfull parcell thereof, and willeth the Arch-priest so to refuse it: therefore, thus condemning it WITHOVT DISTINCTION, he induceth them that Refuse it, to a lawfull perswasion of a TOTALL NEGATIVE, and contrariety of opinion, which is the verie argument of our Sauiour Christ, He, that gathereth not with me, scattereth, that is, who so condemneth mee as WHOLY vnworthy to be receiued, doth thereby will men to Matth. 12. 30. refuse my person; reiect my Doctrine; blaspheme my Works; and TOTALLY denies mee to bee God and Many and renounceth al Prophecies written, and testimonies reuealed concerning mee.

Hee that should say that the whole body of the Decalogue is vnlawfull in it selfe, & repugnant to Christian Liberty; doth he not conclude the vnlawfulnesse of euery seuerall precept in Law
                     •…
                   and withal imply that a Christian (free by grace) may bee (without feare of the Law morall,) an Idolater, Blasphemer, & an Adulterer, &c.? Neither is his Maiesties Argument drawn from the Compound to the parts diuided, the Cardinall hath made no such diuision; for he hath condemned, totum continuum, the Whole body and bulke thereof to be vnlawful: but it is rather à toto ad partes per contraria; as he which denies the Whole world to bee of Gods making, h
                     •…
                   both denies that God made the light, &

Sunne, and Starres, and Planets; and also argues his opinion to bee, either there is no God, or that hee is no Creator.
               
               20 Take therefore the Iesuites owne example, & frame it aright to the point: put the case that an Arrian Prince should contriue an OATH for his subiects to sweare that there are Three Persons in Trinity: that God the Father created Heauen and earth; that the second Person is the Sonne of God, had a beginning of his essence in time, was crucified, dead, and buried, &c. Some Christians searing or hearing of an error therin, but not discouering it, haue recourse to some great Doctor to know his opinion: HE, descrying the Arianisme, forbids them to take it, and not shewing them the erroneous Article, assureth them that the Whole OATH, as it lyeth is vnlawfull: doth not that Doctor condemn all the Articles therein, and willeth them inclusiuely to deny the Trinity, and the Father to bee a Creator? yes, and as much as in him lyeth, causeth the enemies of God to Blaspheme them as Atheists and Pagans for their Generall deniall. And therfore the rule of God Almightie is, Siseparauerit pretiosum á vili, quasi os meum eris, to separate 
                  Ier: 15. 19, 
                  the pretious from the vile is according to my word. THIS the Cardinall should haue done, but did it not; therfore his disallowing it in grosse, sheweth his manifest dislike of euerie Article therin, and his implyedaduice, that Catholikes should denie euen the very first, That King Iames is the Lawfull King of this Realme. Nay, saith this Epistler, that's a calumniation, all Catholikes doe both professe and confesse the contrary.
               
               21 Doe they so? then Father Parsons either is not, or Part. 2. cap. 5. was not a Catholike when he wrote his Doleman; for there hee laboureth the point hard, that King James cannot either by Religion, Nation, Blood or

                     r haue concluded it, that no Hereticke is capable▪ if an Heire; or can bee a iust possessor of a

Crowne when he hath obtained it: then Tortus who hath so pronounced of King Iames, either denies him to bee a lawfull King, or all of that profession are not of the same minde for the King. Yea, wee will goe further; whosoeuer refuseth to sweare to any One of the Articles in this Oath, acknowledgeth not the first, For the Whole Oath is like an Indenture, all the Clauses tying and tending to One condition of Allegeance; the breach of One prouiso in the Indenture forfeits the WHOLE: the denying of any One Article in the Oath, is the denyall of the Whole, euen of the very first.
               
               22 Take but one for example: hee that refuseth to sweare, that the Pope hath no manner of authoritie (simple or compound) to depose the King, hee refuseth to sweare that King Iames is lawfull King of England. For if hee were once lawfull, then is hee euer so; true legitimation is neither intended, nor remitted: and vnlawfulnesse of title ONELY, carieth with it the casualtie of Deposing and Dethroning; it is not varying in Religion, nor altering of manners; nor misordering a Realme: all which may shew a King to be vn iust, but not prooue him an vnlawfull King; they may hazard his safetie, but not impeach his Title. A right of deposing must bee in him, that hath either an higher, power (and thats onely God, for tibi soli peccaui saith Dauid, and none 
                  Psal

Ambrose in cum. but a King can say so) or the iuster claime, and then is not the Souereigne in place the lawfull King; for two seuerall parties cannot haue equall right to One Crowne; but the Pope least of all other, being a Forreiner to the Nation, and an vtter stranger to the bloud. So that hee which denies not the Pope that deposing power, denies vnto our king the Lawfulnesse of his Inuestiture and Dominion. The breefe and truth is, Let a King be what hee will for his Religion or Gouernment; if he haue right to the Crown, the subiect must endure and pray for him; the Forreiner may aduise, but not disturbe him; they both may lament and vse meanes to amend him, but neither of them both assume

the power to Depose him: which authority of the Pope for deposing (as also his power in the rest of the Negatiue parts in the Oath, either of absoluing subiects, or licensing Rebellions, or inciting Murders of Kings excommunicate, &c.) No Compleate Councell euer fastened vpon the Pope; neither can their own Schole-Doctors agree how that should concerne him, but are (as his Maiestie truely obserueth) at irreconciliable Iarrs among themselues about it: to al which the Epistler answereth not one word
               23 But the next exception he takes, is the Example broght out of the Councels of Toledo, especially the fourth; which containeth an Oath of allegeance, commanded and layd vpon all persons without distinction; and therein also the very point of Aequiuocation, so carefully eschued in this Statute Oath. Insomuch, that ALMOST euery point of that Action, & this of ours agreeth, saue that the Fathers of that Councell were carefull to see THAT OATH executed; but he that pretends and vsurpes to be Head of al counsels, is as streight in prohibiting it to his Catholikes.

               24 Were WEE so idle as to follow him in his owne veine, we might catch at these last words of his [but ONLY of flat Lying] and play with his word ONLY as he did before; as if he thereby made flat lying and perfideous dealing, but a small fault; for so hee taxeth his Maiestie, 
                     Parag. 1. Numb. 12. for saying ONLY a forme of Oath was framed; and thereby conclude vpon him with his own words there; By this excepting of ONLY a man may well perceiue this Fugitiue maketh little account of flat lying and perfideous dealing. But let him goe, idle he is, and the Pharao of Rome vseth him accordingly, keepes him to gather such straw and stubble in
                  
                  Egypt, because hee is neither good nor fit for any thing else. Sed Quis tulerit Grachum? while this Iesuite is attaching the Apologer of a supposed fraudulēcie, himself must euen there bee arrested of a Fraudulent impudencie; charging his Maiesty to say, that EVERIE point of that Toletan Action hath aggreeance with ours, and leaues out the principal word which his maiesty vsed, when he saith that ALMOST euery point; & subnecteth immediately a particular exception of disparison. As if there were no difference between his speech that should say, Fa. Parsons was almost vpon the Sea-coast for England, expecting the issue of the POWDER-PLOT, and his that should auerr that he was vpon the Sea-coast, and shipt for England.
               
               25 In the meane time, what sayes he to the Councel of Toledo? it puzzels him horriblie, and makes him roue about, for 8. Num together to shift it, and when hee hath (like a fond Surueyor, who, hauing no more ground then will serue a Goose to graze on, will needes discourse and shew how it abuts vpon al the quarters of the world) whē (I say) he hath with many circumstances set downe, 
                     the occasion of that Councels assembly, with the cause of the Treatie concerning one Sisinandus, that had displaced King Suintula, (the Canon saith, that fearing his owne wickednes, Concil. Tolet. 4. Can. 75. 
                     Seipsum Regno priuauit & exuit, he strip't and depriued himselfe of his Kingdome) and how that the said King procured this fourth Councell; then reckoning vp the Prelates and humble behauiour of the Emperor before them; with the full summe of the Decrees, all of them in Ecclesiasticall causes saue one, the last of all, concerning an Order for the future establishing of their Kings; and then hath told vs of the excommunication denounced against all those that shall attempt the Destruction of their King, or breake their Oath of fidelitie made to him; with a repetition of that cursse, diuers times in that Canon, and a Reason therereof; with a commendation of the Care which those Fathers had for preseruing the Subiects fidelitie to their Princes; and a supplication

                    after all this ranging discourse (as if hee had runne himselfe out of breath and sense to) his sober conclusion is, that this is ALL against the Apologer.

               27 Or is that the point, because the Canons of that Councell were all flatly opposite to the Protestants opinions?

Bee it so: first, the Apologer medled with no one Canon of that Councel, but the last, concerning the Oath. How then doth this make against him? but is it so indeed? view three or foure of them; the mariage of Priests (so
                        •…
                      be with the Consent of the Bishops) is there allowed, Canon 43. that ignorance is the Mother of all errors, (not of deuotion) is there positiuely set downe, Canon 24. that the Clergies immunity from ciuill molestations and trouble is from the King, and by HIS command and authoritie, that's decreed in the 46. Canon. Lastly, that all the Decrees and Canons of that Councell were confirmed by the Clergie ANN VENTIRELIGIO SISSIMO PRINCIPE, after the Kings ROYALL ASSENT had vnto them; and that's let downe Canon 75. Now which of all these makes against either the Apologers discourse, or the Protestants opinion? that so the Reader may see hee might haue spared his marke THIS set vpon Catholike; for the Church of England, both for substance in Doctrine, and Ceremonie in Discipline, doth hold the same, which many of those Canons doe conclude.
               28 As for the particular Canon concerning the Cath how is the Apologer therein taken short? yes, foure waies First, there is no particular forme of an Oath set downe in the Councells but onely a generall command for KEEPING, not for taking an Oath.

                     •…
                  iolable performance therof. So then, an OATH there was,

that's without question; and a forme it had; if not set down in the Councel what's that to the point? Sufficiētly hath his Maiesty euicted what he wold, to proue that this OATH of alleagiance amōgst vsis no such strange thing it hauing a precedent in like kinde, confirmed by diuers Councels about a thousand yeeres since. But is this a good argument, Thereis no forme of an Oath prescribed, therefore either there was NO such Oath, or it is fraudulent dealing in the Apologer to speake of it by the same consequent, the title whereby the Pope supports his Souereignty Monarchicall, and deriues it from S. Peter (euen in spiritual causes may be iustly concluded a fraudulent claime: for when the Keyes were giuē, & that triple Pasce enioyned to Saint Peter (which are the two mayn pillars & refuges for that challenge of the Popes) there is no mention either of Successor or of Rome, 
                  Mat. 16. Ioh. 20 but onely Peter to THEE will I giue the Keyes, and Peter feede THOV my Lambes; the fetching of both which (the Successor & See) into those Texts, driues Bellarmine into a maze: for first hee saith, that the Bishop of Rome is Peters successor IVRE DIVINO, and that Christ

                  appointed it so; presently he saith, that it was FACTVM PETRI, it was Peters owne institution, that the Bishop of Rome should be his successor. Might such reasons preuaile, that Manifest Texts either of Scrîptures or Fathers, verbatim to expresse what we argue, might only take place, or the quarrell end, the Pope would be found a more fraudulent Impostor then a Pastor and Transubstantiation should neuer haue had either the being or beginning.
               
               29. But say, in sooth, Fa. Persons, is there not in those Councels a FORME of such an OATH? De specie, of the kinde and quality of the Oath, it seemes you doubt not; the Councel declares it to be an Oath Promissory, which is defuturo, of something afterwards to bee done: de Re, of the substance and matter of the Oath, it is not questioned, for the Canon sets it downe, and you also confesse it in your second exception, saying that it was an OATH

OF ALLEGEANCE. The Controuersie is of the FORME, which though in Scriptures and Vse we know to bee diuers, yet all conclude that to bee the true forme

                    How will he auoide the TESTAM VR aboue cited? Perhaps he will say there is an OATH described, but not prescribed. Acutely, Be it that the State Secular framed the Oath and enioyned the Subiect to take it, yet the Councell assembled confirmed the Oath, (which is all that his Maiesty endeuonred to proue) and expresseth the Forme therof as it was conceiued: Diuines then do teach vs, that euery Canon of Confirmation by a Councell, is a prescript of Iniunction for Obedience.

But put the case that the King had Pro. 29. 11. asked Abraham whether Sarai had beene his wife and he had said, No, reseruing the other part [She is my Sister] in his minde, this had beene a flat Lie in Diuinity: and yet it is the same which the Iesuites call Aequiuocating. For it is an ouer-rul'd case among them, that if the Question be put to one of them, Whether he be a Priest, by the rule of Aequiuocation he may answere, No, (though he know himselfe to be one) reseruing some Euasion within himselfe. Is then to reserue in mind any thing which we know contrary to that which the tong vttereth, whether answering to a Question, or swearing before a Iudge; is that (I say) Aequiuocating or flat lying?

which the Councell calleth Swearing in the name of God DECEITFULLY; but passeth to the particular exceptions against the Cardinals Letter, which he calleth

For in the Seuen Exceptions (so many they are to be numbred) not the Cardinals weaknesse of iudgement, but wickednesse of hast and affection (which is the chiefe seat of Religion) is ransack't & discouered to the world, as it rightly deserueth: For wheras the generall opinion, conceiued commonly of the Cardinall, hath beene this, by those that haue not pondered his works, (and Prefaces especially) that Father Rob. Bellarmine hath beene no base Pragmaticall Fa. Parsons but an honest, quiet, ingenuous Student; now, by this his Letter to Blackwell, he is truely made knowen, first, to bestow some good part of his houres in receiuing Intelligences out of England, how painefully Blackwell & his fellowes doe labour euery day and houre, like true Foxes & Swine, in rooting and vndermining the Lords Vvteyard so that for the space of almost these forty yeeres, neither Hart, nor Campion, nor Garnet, nor Gerrard, nor any other D sturber of our Christian Peace, hath wanted Bellumarma-minas, from Bellarmine, howsoeuer hee couers it vnder Numa his

                  Plut. Num. nor acceptable to God, nor any way profitable to them for whom he prayeth; so long as he now reuealeth himselfe (which is the third exception) to account Death for Treason to bee the most reioycefull kinde of Martyrdome:
                  
and withall (which is the fourth) to esteeme of our Gratious Soueraigne as of an other Iulian and a most bloody persecutor. To which foure, and to the other three, as well concerning Bellarmines mislike of the Modification in the offring of the Oath as also of the challenge, that no pointe in the Oath tendeth to matter of Faith, which shold make him that sweareth, either to beleeue or not beleeue anie Article of Religion: and lastly of the Rebutter to that vnsauerie and vnmannerly comparison, betweene Peters Successor, and our Soueraigne his Succession from King Henrie, that neither the Popes doctrinall nor personal successiō, can come neere any such probable warrant or assurance, as that there should be any semblance of comparison: to all these this Contre-defender scarse spends three Sections and that in answering only two of them.
               2 The first whereof is clearing of Bellarmine from the Imputation, that the Greatest Traytors and Conspirators against her late Maiesty (and particularly Campian and Hart) gaue vp Fa. Rob. Bellarmine for one of their greatest Oracles, and this hee doth two waies. First, dubbing it for an ABVSE exceeding a mans imagination, that the Apologer should thus write. Secondly, a deceiptfull Aequiuocation; that because they did cite him in Controuersies of Religion, therefore he should be accounted an Author of their Conspiracies.
               
               3 It is well that hee will giue Aequiuocation the right Epithete of Deceipt; but did his Maiesty say HEE was alleadged by them as the Oracle of their Conspiracies? No his words are, the greatest Traitors and Fomentors of CONSPIRATORS, gaue Bellarmine vp for one of their greatest Oracles in their Conference; (for thereto his Maiesty referres the Reader in the Margin) wherof their Conspiracies was no part. For their Treasons they were arraigned Apol. pa. 57. conuicted, and adiudged; the Conference was had about their opinions in Religion; in which Colloquie, the prinpall Author they relyed vpon (Campian borrowed much

from him, and Hart, called for him by name) was Bellar mine, whose Dictats there specified, were transcribed; and Conference in the Tower pa:, 6. euerie yong Nouice that came into England, was bound to haue them; for to them principally, the Cardinall was appointed the Doctor of the Chaire and Reader of Diuinity, as himselfe boasteth in the preface mentioned by his maiestie. Tom. 1. Contr.
               
               4 Secondly, had HE bin concluded as the greatest Oracle of those and other like Conspirators, there is no such improbabilitie of truth, no waies to be defended, as this Censurer auoweth; but the argument is necessary: For the Cardinall being their principall Author for opinions, and the issue of those opinions being Treason and Conspiracie, it is more then probable, that from HIS positions and Lectures, they had suck't that poison which there ranckled at their hearts, and heere broke out (at their arriuall) in their actions. The Apologue is knowne and proper, that when the Trumpeter was taken in battell, and pleaded for his life, that HEE had killed no man, nor shed any blood, Aesop. 
                  Only sounded his instrument which gaue a pleasant noise; the answere was, that HE did more harme, and was the greatest slaughterman in the Army; because, were it not for his heartning and inciting sound, the horror of the crie and blood would appall his fellowes hearts; but when they were ready to quaile, HE then prouok't them to a fresh assault. And it was not for any valour that was in thē or any hostile Acte in open armes done by them, that made Philip of Macedon to condition with the Athenians 
                  Plut. Demosth. for yeelding vp their Orators vnto him; but because by their inforcing Rhetorique, they perswaded and incited the Citizens to the continuance of warre, he reputed them for his deadliest and most annoying enemies.
               5 Which is the very Case of Bellarmine; He, in his Lectures & Dictats, blowes the bellows of Seditious Doctrine which flames out by his schollers Conspiracies, to the disturbance of the chiefe States of Christendome. One part

of his Lectures, whether at Louan or Rome (for he read in both) whereof his Dictates were an extract, was his fift 
                  Passeui. bibli. select lib. 7. cap. 4 & Tort. pa. 64. 
                  booke DE ROMANO PONTIFICE: and what's the whole summe of that, but Arguments and Examples, to prooue and shew that the Pope, may by his imperiall power (though indirectly) depose Princes from their states, and Seates? his familiaritie therefore being more inward with the Nouices of England, because he was their Maister, his Maiestie might properly call him the Oracle of his Schollers Conspiracies; for they are the onely visible issue and effect of his Doctrine in them, for ought appeares yet. So much for that.
               6 Now heere the Censurer makes an Almaine leape, skipping 3. whole pages together; and the second thing he alights vpō is his Maiesties complaint, (with our Sauiour) that neither seueritie nor mildenes; that neither weeping 
                  Mat. 
                        〈◊〉

                  Allen. Apolog. ca. 1. sect. 5. saith Cardinall Allen: this OATH OF ALLEGIANCE is offered (by their owne confession) tempered and modified, and it is the greatest affliction and angariation of 
                  Pag. 8. &c. 
                  spirit that euer did betide distressed Catholiks, saith this Cardinal-Parasite. It is the subtile sleight of Satan impugning the 
                  Epist. ad Archi pres. 
                  Primacie of the Sea Apostolike, vnlawfull and repugnant to Christian Faith, saith Cardinall Bellarmine. Now whereunto shal we compare this wayward generation, whom neither rigor nor temperature can please? giue them merum, wine from the Grape; that makes them Brainesicke to storme and raue: reach them Dilutum, allaid and mixt; that makes them stomacke-sicke, to disgorge and vent their inward rancor against the state. And dooth not this giue a iust cause of his Maiesties complaint? wherein, what is there that should make the Apologer blush at it?
               7 Blushing is no vertue, but a laudable affection saith Aristot. Eth. 4.
                  
the Philosopher, and that in young men and vnderlings Only for in Magistrates and men of yeares it is not com mendable, because it is to be presumed, that they will doe nothing which shall procure their blushing: belike then there is here some maine & shamefull Crime that is thus Censured! and what is that? Forsooth,  
                     the Cardinall doth not say that the Oath is TEMPERATE in wordes; but TEMPERED in matter.
                   And can matter bee exprest without words? And is not Temperatum in Latin, as truely translated Temperate as Tempered? And when mention is of things written; rather attributed to words, then matter? as in Tully, and Hierom often, to temper the st

                  Tort. pa. 66. they should kick at this also, though themselues confesse it to bee tempered, that is allayed, by a proportionate mixture, and so the Cardinall meant; otherwise his other word modified were vnnecessarie, which signifies drawing to an equall measure, as when a thing is made neither too sharpe nor too sweete, nor too high nor too lowe, &c, But that the Cardinall meant it was tempered in the stile, and Words, it is manifest by himselfe in that subsequent speech of his, Certe enim quibuscunque VERBIS Iuramentum ab aduersarijt Fidei concipiatur in Regno isto: certainely with what WORDS soeuer that OATH is conceiued by the aduersaries

               8 And as this is his Maiesties cōplaint, so the ground thereof also remaines yet good; for surely did they not build a Monarchy to the Pope and not to Christ, one of these courses would content them; either that of the first Oath, seuerely peremptorie for the Princes Supremacie in
                  
                  Spirituall causes: or Moderately TEMPERED for his Souereignty onely in Temporall respects, the sole subiect of this last OATH. Which his Maiestie euicteth by a double Question; First, can there be found in all the OATH one word tending to matter of Religion? whereunto the Censurer makes a short & a slie answere, in a conclusion affirmatiue vpon a Supposall; If the power and authority of the Pope and Sea Apostolike, less by Christ for gouerning his Church 
                        •…
                     n all occasions, be a point of Religion, then there are ten or twelue Articles or Branches in the OATH touching Religion.
               
               9 And wil the Pope Iudicially forbid, & the Cardinal doctrinally conclude, & the Epistler impudently impugne the Oath as vtterly vnlawful & against Religiō, which yet depē
                  deth vpō an IF; & is not yet determined for a point of Reli giō, that the Pope hath any such authority ouer kings, as in the Oath is mētioned? This therfore is his maiesties pressing questiō, & shold haue forced the Iesuit to tuch the quick; but like an Aequiuocating Iugler, he bemist's the Reader in cunning conueyance, and supposeth an authority lest by Christ to the Pope, but distinguisheth not whether in Ecclesiasticall or Ciuill causes: for put the case it were granted, that the Pope had his Supremacie in Ecclesiasticall causes from our Sauiour Christ, this is not now the questiō in hand, neither doth the Oath meddle in that matter: his other vsurped claime ouer Kings and Princes, till it be determined for an Article of Religion, the OATH dooth iustly oppose; and yet without touch or impeach of any point of Christian (yea, or their owne Catholike) Religion: for a controuersie vndetermined, cannot bee held in any Church, eyther for Article of Faith or principle Theologicall, and thereupon ensues his Maiesties Second question.
               10 Doeth he that taketh the OATH promise to BELEEVE or NOT to BELEEVE any Article of Religion? To which, the Iesuite puts the Oath it selfe to make the answere

                   Secondly, What will the Apologer say hecre? Surely nothing, (to put the last first) for hee hath more serious affaires in hand, then to answere such pelting questions.
               11 ONE that hath lesse iudgement and more leisure will easily shape a sutable answere, that this Censurer is an absurd disputant, still to beg the question: as if these Articles abiured or allowed by him that takes the Oath were points of Faith which are but Machia
                        •…
                     lisines of the Conclaue; or as is beleefe were euery where vsed Theologically, and that a Christians beleefe should be alwaies taken for his Christian beleefe: for there is a naturall beleefe, the Obiects whereof are naturall and Ciuill things, such as in this Oath, wherin ther is not any clause which is not groūded vpon the very principles of nature; that though there were no word of God at all (which is the true ground of Christian Faith, and wherunto his Maiesty hath reference in his question) yet euery good Subiect is bound to beleeue and to bee resolued in his Conscience, euen in the light of nature, as a truth which without Scripture is infallibly sound that he must obey his parents both of body and countrie, and abiure and resist (by al meanes) any, that should impeach his Souereigne either in his Title or Person, which two, euen the very law of nature, hath so fastned vnto him, that no authoritie or power may alter or hinder.

His Maiesty therfore added for the explanation of himselfe (which might haue preuēted al this verball Cauill, had the Censurer purposed, or were able to deal ingenuously) that the taker of the Oath is not boūd therby to beleeue or not beleeue any point of faith, whether Articles of the creed, or positions in Scripture, or determinations of the Church; for Morall Certitudes, and piè Credendum, and Historicall narrations, (which are the strongest resolutions and best groundes for the Pope either his succession or Souereigntie) must not, as his Maiesty most wisely obserueth, passe currant for Articles of Faith, although the Cardinall thinks it sufficient for his greatnes in a bare assertion to say, that the Oath endamageth the Christian Faith: which when (without proofe) he hath confidently and Categorically auerred; frō the Arch-Priest, he mounts to the King; & turns the enuie of the Oath vpon his Maiesties causelesse feare of danger from the Pope, because it was neuer heard off from the churches infancy that any Prince though an Heretick, though Ethnicke, though a Persecutor, was murdered by the Pope either his Commaund or allow

               12 Vnto which obiection of Panic feare, his Maiesty in his reply, purposely (vpon good iudgement) auoideth to make any answere; the sinceritie of his conscience witnessing within himselfe, and the opennesse of his cariage shewing him in the world, to bee as confident as a Lion: otherwise his Maiesty might haue told Bellarmine, that if in any persons, in Princes especially, that rule is necessary Abundans Cauteli nonnocet, Kings cannot bee to prouident for their safetie; in which respect it is obserued in Homer, that he euer presented the great commanders in the field arm'd at all points; and that the Lawgiuers among the Grecians, made streight decrees against

their safety in defending themselues, then of their valour to annoy their foes: for both Scripture and nature make it plain, that in a King (though one in person) the liues of Millions are indangered; and if any Prince were euer forced to stand vpon his safe-guard, and fence himselfe with Lawes, our Soueraigne much rather, hauing such Embowelled enemies within his Realmes as Iesuites are, and doe procure; and such Hydra-headed Treasons; suppullulating one after the other, and exceeding each other in degrees of vnspeakeable crueltie: and of all other times, Now especially, that they Refuse and Prohibite others to say their hearts open by taking this Oath. But his Maiesty passing by that, as a sillly frumpe of a WHITE LIVERED RED-CAP, obserueth in this speech of the Cardinall: first his voluntary but subtile-preter-ition, in leauing out all the other disasters in the Oath, wherwith Popes haue affrighted and infested Emperors & Kings (as Deposing, Degrading, Exciting Armes, Kindling Rebellions, &c.) and insists heere, onely vpon One, Sc. murdering of Princes; and this verie cautelously done by the Cardinall; lest (as his Maiesty well obserueth) hee should in open and direct tearmes Crosse his Owne Pofitions, wherwith his books are stuffed
               13. All which, the Cardinals Page, this Antapologer passeth in silence, and staieth himselfe vpon the second; wherein his Maiesty chargeth Bellarmine with an implied Contradiction against himselfe, in that deniall of his, that Popes haue neither 
                     •…
                  manded nor allowed Murders of Princes; seeing that Bellarmine confesseth (and exemplifieth it) that they haue waged warres against them diuers times. And what difference is there betweene personall murdring of Princes, and raising warres against them, the lot whereof is common and vnpartiall? Nunc bunc, nunc illum ferit

                  2. Sam. 17. 2. and alloweth Rebellious and Ciuill Warres in hostile armes against naturall Souereignes, doth much more allow their personall Murders; vnlesse his meaning be, that they shall not die alone; or that the more blood is shed, and more money spent, the greater shall be his glorie. And that Popes haue thus done, no other testimony neede bee brought, but out of Bellarmines Bookes.
               14 This the Censurer heere answereth, first, by diuerting the Argument, Num. 27. and saith That though the Pope hath waged warre against Princes, yet hee neuer caused any to be VNLAWFVLLY murdered. Wherein he dealeth like Sauls armor-bearer; because the Cardinall hath stabb'd himselfe somewhat grosly, he will helpe to kill him more cleanly & neatly: for the Aduerbe is worth the obseruing, secretly implying, that the Pope hath commanded, or may command Princes to be murdered, but not VNLAWFVLLY; whereby it seemes Lawfull Murders of them haue beene commanded and commended; and of the Lawfulnesse no man may iudge, if the Pope say the word: so that what Stories soeuer Bellarmine hath quoted, or what Murders the Pope hath committed, or we can enumerate, this one Aduerbe must salue them all; Either they were not UNLAWFVLLY done, or else the causes were IVST, saith this Epistler; or (which is a pretty passage, Numb. 28.) 
                     the Popes haue PERSWADED themselues they were IVST: and therefore (as a Generall in the field) pursued them as open enemies; or (as a Iudge vpon the bench) commanded execution to bee done vpon them as MALE-FACTORS.
                  
               
               15 But first, who girt the Sword to the Popes side: Suppose the Keies were put into his hands, they are no

weapons for warre; as he is a Priest, he may not fight: Our weapons (saith the Apostle) are spirituall; Teares, and Praiers, and Sighs; for with no other we may resist, saith S. Ambrose 
                  2. Cor. 10. lab. 5. ep. 33. If as a Temporall Prince, defend his owne Territories he may; but hostily to inuade another Kings Land, or infest his Kingdome with Rebellions, or aide his Subiects with wages, or Armes, hee may not. And yet he hath done it; for HE depriued Leo the Emperor (if Bellarmines report be true) from the Principalitie of Rauenna, when as yet he had nothing to do with it; for it came to his patrimonie

(for Ecclesiasticall Censure stretcheth not to Goods & Life,) If ouer his Underlings and Vassals; be it so: yet ouer princes in no case, who are the second and next persons in Comparison of God, after whom they be the first and highest, but AFORE all,

In the second place, the Iesuite denies the consequent, both in generall and particular; That though Bellarmine confesse Popes to haue waged Warres, and Deposed Emperors, yet it is no opposition to himselfe, when hee saith, that no Pope euer commanded the murder of Princes to be committed; or commended them after they were committed As if Capitis Dim

                     entine, he would neuer haue let fall such a peremptory conclusion. Or were there no Example of Fact extant against the Popes in this kinde, yet that they may command Princes to be killed, is Bellarm nes owne Doctrine, both Symbolicall, as the Spirit may command the De Pontif.

Christians may not tollerate or suffer an Infidell, or in Hereticall King to reigne ouer them; but to iudge of Infidelity and Heresie, belongs Only to the Pope, saith hee, and therefore at his doome, the King must stand or fall. And lest it shold be said, that this reacheth but to Deposing, not to Death, it followeth after, that such a King is Ibid. Paragr. Quarta ratio. 
                  vnworthy to receiue the Sacramēt of Baptisme, who takes it for an iniury done to him, if the Church (that is, the Pope) adiudge him to loose his honor and wealth, adhuc autem & ANIMAMSVAM, yea, his Life also; for to that end doth he cite the place out of the Gospell. Luc. 14.
               
               17 But the first particular instance which his Maiesty bringeth of the Popes fury against the Sonne for the interring of his Father the Deposed Emperor; as it ratifieth the Position that Popes do allow of Princes Murders (for they that execute their rage vpon a dead corps, t'is questionles they pursued (in heart at least) that man to death, and are more then glad when he is dead: so doth it put this Antapologer to much trouble, and many shifts, both fond and false, to transferre as wel this barbarous rage & prophane Exhumation from their Holy Primate, as also his incensing the Sonne to Rebellion against his naturall Father;
                    which

                  two points are warranted by their owne Writers, some of them liuing about the same time.
               18. For the first, the digging him out of his graue, that's compassed with a whole cloud of Witnesses; some writing, that tanta seueritate Dominus Papa in ipsum vltus est, The Pope pursued him with such implicable reuenge, that 
                  Helmold. hist. Slau. cap. 33. 
                  being dead, HVMARI NON SINERET, he would not suffer him to bee buried: Another, The Bishop of Liege, with others of his sort, were receiued into the Communion of the 
                  Vrspergens. an. 1106. 
                  Church, (who cast them Out but the Pope?) vpon Condition they would DIGGE OVT of the graue the Corps of the Emperor, which he had BEFORE BVRIED in the Monasterie. The very same, another Historian verbatim relateth, both for the Fact, and Reason of the Fact; They Naucler. vol. 1 gen. 37. be the very last words wherewith Sigonius ends one of his Bookes; His body lay vnburied in a Desars Cell for fiue yeers, PONTIFICE ID SEPELIRI VET ANTE, 
                  De regno Italiae. lib. 9. 
                  because the Pope had forbidden the Interring of it: For, being put into the Earth, (saith a late Compiler of their owne) HORTATVPAPAE, by the Popes perswasion, EXHVMATVM, Binnius, Tom. 3. Concil. vita Paschal. 2. 
                  it was DIGGED out againe, and remained aboue ground fiue yeares.
               
               19 Yea, but Cuspinian (whom the Apologer in the Margin quot eth) his wordes are cleane contrary (saith this Censurer) for thus he writes; 
                    when Henry the Father was dead, and buried in a Monastery at Leige, his Sonne would not make peace with the Bishop of that place, except the dead body were pulled out of the graue againe. Surely, this was an ouersight of the Apologer (for want of wel vnderstāding his Grāmer) to make such an Escape, seeing that the words are so plaine, Filio procurante, non potuit reconciliari Episcopus 
                  Cuspinian. in Henr. 4. 
                  Leodiensis, nisi exhumaretur Cadauer: That is, By the sons procurement, (At whose hands but the Popes, For what need any procurement by himselfe to himselfe?) the Bishop could not be reconciled, (to whom but to the Pope, who had accursed both Church and Church men at Leige for putting
                  
                  the body of the deceased Emperour into the graue?)

                  All things at Liege were blasted with the Popes Thunder-clap, for discharging that Christian (at least ciuill and last) duty to their Master: Whereupon, Mandato Pontificis è Coemiterio 
                  Idem ibi. 
                  cijcitur, By the Popes Mandate his Corps was throwen out of the Church-yard, and all Christian buriall denied it, saith the same Author who liued in those times, and was (by his owne testimonie) Notarie and Chaplaine to three Emperors: so that the Reconciliation or Peace to bee made, was with the Pope, not the yong Emperor, who (perhaps) did procure the stay thereof.
               20 Why then, All this proceeded from the Sonne, who PROCVRED the Pope to do it, and therefore it is falsly ascribed to HIS HOLINESSE. Yet this is nothing to any iarre betweene the Sonne and the Bishop. But would the Pope yeeld so much to the vngratious and vnnaturall despight of a Parricidious Vsurper, making a request so barbarous and beastly? Perhaps the Sonne was importunate, and so the Pope, like the good natur'd Iudge in the Gospell, though he neither feared God, nor regarded man, yet saith he, Quiamolestus est mihi hic Imperator, because 
                  Luc. 18. 
                  hee so importunes mee, be it as hee will. And that the Sonne was so instantly importunate, is most cleere; for Filius ossa 
                  Viterb. vbi supra. 
                  patris DOLVIT fore cum sceleratis, saith the foresaid Writer, It VEXED the Sonne to the heart, that his Fathers bones should be CASTOVT among Malefactors: which doubtlesse is an euident Argument, that hee sued hard, that his Father might not bee buried, because men vse to plead hard, that they may obtain what they vtterly dislike. Therefore, for a further confirmation thereof, that it was the Sonnes impietie, not the Popes malice; when the Emperor and Pope came to parlee vpon Conditions, this was Annal tom. 12. an. IIII. ex Paulo Diacono, lib. 4. cap. 38. 
                  One, as Baronius (who, you may bee sure, will write all that he can which may sound to the Popes disgrace) sets it downe: POSTVLAT Imperator, vt Patris sui CORPVS
                  
                  in Ecclesia SEPELIRI permit

                      at: The yoong Emperor earnestly REQVIRES, that his FATHERS CORPS might be INTERRED: To which demand the Pope, that the world might know, that the keeping him out of the graue was against his will (good man) presently yeelds, with a strong Negatiue, and tels him IT MAY NOT BE; and giues him his reason, for that HE had receiued a TERRIBLE Iniunction from the martyrs deceased, and in those places shrined, that he should suffer no WICKED PERSONS, to be BVRIED within their Churches, for THEY WOVLD not endure it. And therefore the Reader must needs see, that this Censurer had iust cause to say that ALL this is falsly ascribed to the Pope.
               
               21 The Second thing in this Story, wherewith his Maiestie chargeth the Pope, is, that he Stirred vp the Sonne against his Father, and procured his ruine; whereof this Epistler would also ease their Holy Father, and that by the Apologers alleaged Author Cuspinian, who writes,
                    that it was REPORTED, how Hildebrand had absolued the Emperor before his Death, but that his SONNE neuer left SOLLICITING the succeeding Popes, to EXCOMMVNICATE him againe. First, this is written but for a report, then which there is nothing more vncertaine, saith the Orator; but yet what followes heereof? Philippic. 2. Therefore the Pope stirred not vp the Sonne against the Father: A weake Consequent: Absolution of the Emperour from the Curse, freeth not the Pope from his Instigation of the Sonne in pursuit of his Father; therefore the same report which Cuspinian records, doth adde (which the Iesuite, according to his common honesty, leaues out) and set downe the cause why the Pope absolued the Emperour; namely, because Hildebrand the Monke (otherwise Gregory the Seuenth) was much grieued in minde, quòd Henricum 
                  Cuspinian vbi supra. 
                  Imperatorem iniquè molestasses, that hee had vexed and molested Henry the Emperor WRONGFULLY and VNIUSTLY; and in that anguish of minde confesseth (as

a Friar witnesseth) that he did it at the instinct of the Diuell: and among other, he raised vp Rodolph Count of Reins

                  field, against the Emperor his Master, Cui omnia debebat, to whom he owed all that he had, and sent him a Crowne Imperiall circled about with an Inscription of S. Peters 
                  Cuspin. Hen. 4. name and gift.
               22 But what's this to the inciting of the Sonne? Nothing; for Pope Gregory or Hildebrand, who in distresse of soule absolued the Emperor, died before this his Sonne Henry the fift rebelled; but yet by the meanes of Mathilda the Emperors kinswoman, & the Popes too neere neighbor, (Pontificis latericomes indiuidua adhaerebat, shee stucke close to the Pope at all assaies and seasons) Conradus his Idem ibid. eldest sonne was instigated to rebell: for which cause the Father disinherited him, and appointed Henry his yonger brother for Heire apparant but then came Paschal the second into the See, who curst him and re-curst him, iterum atque iterum, saith Cuspinian. And after that, from the Conuention of Mentz, were sent two or three Bishops in the Popes name, to fetch from him his Regalia, and Imperiall Ornaments, that his Sonne (who was then in Armes against him) might be inuested. What Authour can the Apologer bring, that auoucheth this, saith the Epistler? No better then the messengers themselues, the Bishops of Colen and Wormez, who told the old Emperor to his face, Pontifici Principibusque Germaniae placuit, It seemeth good to the Pope and the Prince of Germanie, that thou be Sigonius de regno Ital. lib. 9. anno. 1106. depriued of the Communion of the faithfull, and deturbed or tumbled out of the possession of thy Kingdome. This saith Sigonius; & Genebrard comes not short of him, who saith, that this was done, Iussis Paschalis Pontificis, at the Genebrar. li. 4. anno. mundi. 5206. Commandement of Pope Paschal: and yet, saith Fa. Parsons, 
                  Here is much said against the Pope with little proofe. Not so much as the Pope laid & laid against that Emperor, with lesse warrant; Excommunicating him for Symonie, and the proofe, because hee had taken a Sword in

lieu of his fauor, for bestowing 
                     •…
                  ree Bishoprickes. Indeed the Bishops which came to diuest him, they laid it foule to his charge; for the Emperour asking them of Colen and Mentz (the richest and amplest Prelacies of Germany) what great matter he exicted of them when he conferred those dignities vpon them? they stucke not to tell him plainly, that hee had neither exacted, nor taken ANY THING: yet this was the huge Simonist, so pursued Sigonius vbi supra. with the Popes malice, and their Parasites pens.
               23. The Second Instance which his Maiestie bringeth to confute the Cardinals generall negatiue, is a recent, & extant Panegyrike, in extolling the Murderer & Murder of King Henry the third of France, made by a Pope: who, Iob. 32. 19: as if he had beene another yoong E

To the first part whereof this Epistler answereth, Numb. 30. that there is no Record of Credit in Rome (if hee had staid there, hee had said true perhaps) or elsewhere, that Pope Sixtus euer made any such speech. Is it not time well spent to deale with such vnhonest Shifters?

the Booke is so full of impudent lies. Now this second Example, famous to the world, being yet fresh in memorie, & the Oration in print translated into diuers languages, with the day of the moneth and yeer, and place prefixed with this inscription Sixti Quinti Pont.

                  Bretherens Sale; for so farre forth as in their treacherous and vnnatural cheuisance there was a premission of him into Egipt, and a preseruation of them in his beeing there, that was Gods prouidence, who in his secret Councell decreed this so to be, and foresaw that it should so be, non studio mali, sed bono populi, not approouing their ill, but intending their good: Otherwise Balbus the Emperour, and the Caïan Heretickes are more iustifiable then the Pope, for they Zonar Gr. c. fab. lib. 1. Epiphan Aug. &c. commended Iudas for the betraying of his master, because hee fore-sawe it to be the only meanes of mans Redemption.
               25 But yet, if we should examine this bald excuse, what was the strange & admirable prouidēce in this murther? had the Monke come into the Campe like another Scaeuola, and (being a professed enemy, entred the Kings Pauilion, I. in. lib. 2. in the thickest of the crowd standing about the King, and not discouered by habit or otherwise) had strook at him openly with his weapon; that had been a more manly and a more strange Act, & far more honest, for there it was hostis hostem, one enemy striking another: or had the Friar challenged the King to a single Combat, vnarmed in his Coule, with a weapon only, and had slain the King by fine force, or some Rauen or Foule of the ayre (assisting the Idem lib. 7. 
                  Friar in the Monomachy) had still beene bearing in the Kings face, as a Frenchman was serued in the Roman story this had beene a plentifull theame for the Pope to haue dilated vpon Gods strange Prouidence, to haue said with Liny, Dishomines

                      illi assuere pugnae: but that a Priest (not secular but retired) professing more then ordinarie mortification, should nourish such rancor, blood, and Treason in his inner partes, and arme himselfe with a two edged knife, and the same poisoned, that so the blow might bee speedie, but the death with Torment; and should make God to hee the Author and Abettor of his Parricide (for night and day hee praied his assistance, by their owne report Mercur. Gallobelg. and praise) and in his Friarly garments (habits of

peace and pietie) crauing accesse to his Souereigne (who neuer denied it to men of his sort) vnder pretence of Letters and Message of importance, while the King gratiously stoop't to him for receipt thereof, should villanously and cowardly stabbe the Lords annointed; and a Pope (the huge Diuine of the Christian world) should admire this as an Act of Gods strange prouidence, being so contrary to religion, honestie, and the very light and law of Nature, it doth argue either this Iesuite to be of a strange boldnesse, to referre the Popes Oration to such an high Common place; or else the Pope to bee a strange Diuine to attribute the treasonable Murther of an annointed King (by a Popish Friar) to Gods prouidence; which Dauid celebrateth for Rescuing, not destroying Kings: for it is he that giueth DELIVERANCE vnto Kings sayeth the Prophet in the Psal. 44. Psalme.
               26 But in the second part of the Popes Oration, as they doe sort it, and call it an Admonition,  
                  (that the manner of the Murther, (and one circumstance thereof e specially) WHEN NOTHING WAS LESSE EXPECTED, might be a spectacle vnto Princes to bee more moderate in their power)
                    this one thing alone wee will obserue, that if the POWDER-PLOT of the Iesuits had taken effect, what whole seluses of Rhetoricke had beene opened for Orations in this kinde, to all Nations Christned, for Kings and Princes to haue beene more Moderate in their Lawes and penalties; for that the King of Great Britaine with his deerest Queene and eldest Sonne, enuironed with his chiefe Officers of State, compassed with all his Nobles and Peeres of all sorts, attended with the choice floure of the Lands Gentrie, and Comminaltie, in that very place where those rigorous Lawes were enacted, should be blowne vp on the sudden, with the touch of one hand of a silly fellow, WHEN NOTHING LESSE WAS EXPECTED? And this also must haue beene ascribed to Gods strange prouidence, that so many barrels of

                  Gun-powder, being at seuerall times couched, were neuer discouered before the blowe was giuen. But this in conclusion you see, that what they would deny, perforce they confesse; that a speech there was made by the Pope; and be their Glosses neuer so cunning or impudent, the Oration extant (neuer yet controuled) will remaine for a perpetual monument, to shew that the Pope reioyced in it, as a retaliated reuenge vpon the Kings person, for some

29 This the Epistler striueth to fling off with his second Interrogation, consisting vpon three WHATS, drawne from the Popes intellectuals and sensibles; wherin he shewes some small grace, purposely to auoid a positiue deniall, simply to say that the Pope neither knew or euer heard of any such thing; but thus hee propounds it, WHAT if hee knew not? WHAT if hee heard not? WHAT if hee saw some ridiculous deuises? There is no such insensibilitie as that which is wilfull and of purpose; and some men will pretend to be deafe, saue when they heare what they like of. Rome belike is desolate from resort; and sequestred from Intelligence; and England so voide of Romish Agents; and the Pope so destitute of busie Informers, that it is no maruaile if HE were vtterly ignorant of such occurrences: but according to the prouerb, there is none so blinde as hee which will not see. Gallio in the Acts, saw Sosthenes the chiefe Ruler strucken in his Act 18. 17 presence, and in the face of the Court, but the text saith, Gallio cared not to take knowledge of these things; which is the Popes verie case in this point: and yet it seemes HE could SEE some fained Deuises against Priests to affright the Queene, (especially that of Walpoll and Squire,) which hee descried to bee a MONSTROVS FICTION. Like enough; for a false glasse will present deceiuing Vide Catech. Iesuit. obiects: perhaps the Pope did looke through Parsons spectacles. But the party himselfe confessing the Fact; the Iurie finding the Gilt; and the Priests of Rome acknowledging it, and writing it to be true; how comes it beyōd-sea to be but a fained deuise? Some will not beleeue a man is bald vnlesse they may see his Braines; nor the Pope conceiue that the QVEENE should haue beene poysoned, except She had beene seene to swell and dye presently. Had Squires poison taken the effect entended, it then had beene an act of a Martyr, but being discouered and defeated, tis now become a Fiction like a Monster. The best is, that the Records of English Courts

come not within the reach of Index Expurgatorius; the fact is too euident to be denied; the Euidence too substantiall to bee deuised; and the proceeding more iust then can be controlled.

Peters Keyes open the widest gate in Heauen to Parrie for accomplishing it, absolutely approouing the Intention, and gratiously absoluing the murtherer from all his Sins for acting it? doth not the

               31 But the third and most impudent, is his Apologie, 
                  that if the Popes did proceede against Her as a MALEFACTOR,
                   
                  (as well by SPIRITVAL as by TEMPORAL Armes also) for her REMOOVALL, who,
                  
                     
                     being ILLEGITIMATE by Parlament, did as THEY were perswaded) vsurpe the Cronne, to the preiudice of his Maiesties mother and himselfe, they might IVSTLY doe it.
                   
                  Tam Marti quàm Mercurio, is (it seemes) the Inscription vpon the Popes Keies; Law or Warres, to Rifle the Titles, or Ruffle with the Thrones and in the Realmes of Princes, are at the Popes choice: but a man would imagine at the first reading and hearing of a Popes proceeding against a WOMAN malefactor, that some Curtizan in Rome had appeared before him in his Ecclesiasticall Consistorie for her vnlawfull lust; but when he comes to Temporall Armes, and seeth it touch the Remoouall of that Lady QVEENE ELIZABETH (the Diamond among Princes, the glory of Royall Maiestie, and the ioy of the Christian world for her Sex, while she liued) he might with iust disdaine aske, What had the Bishop of Rome to entermeddle in England, or with HER Crowne? And bid him looke home to his owne vsurping claime; because there are more Euidences to proue HIM to be that Antichrist then euer could be to shew that She was illegitimate.
               
               32 Yes (saith he) Her Father, the Arches, and Parlament did Sentence her SO;
                    And the same Father, Arches, and Parlament, (vpon better grounds, within few yeares) renounced the said Sentence, and repealed that Act, as before was said. 
                     But being once true (quoth hee) no humane power could make it vntrue, to the preiudice of another,
                   If the Illegitimation had beene in her Blood, no Law could make it good against the right Heire; but that being sound, seeming allegations & plausible inferences might for the time dazell (not alter) her Right; but they being cleered & reuersed, these second Deliberations did not so much establish her Right (which was inherēt in her Blood) as make it more apparant and sensibly incontroulable.

               37 Ouer whom, as if the Cardinall were gasping for breath, vnder the blow he hath receiued for his Contradictions, after the Epistler hath a while brau'd it with some Rhetoricall flourishes, as, I cannot but maruell, &c.and, I am ashamed for my Countries sake, &c.(he meanes, that his Countrey is ashamed of him) and,   If my iudgement deceiue me not, &c.  and, Though I meane not to discusse, &c. with diuers such round-abouts; at last, of the eleuen wounds by Contradiction which were giuen the Cardinal, he takes vpon him (as Chirurgeon of the Campe) to cure 3. or 4. of them: and first he begins with that of Confidence in good Workes, Numb. 35 &c.
               38 The crossing Proposition in Bellarmine is this; For the VNCERTAINTIE of our owne Righteousnesse,

                     glory, the SAFEST course is to repose our WHOLE confidence in the ALONE mercie and bounty of God; and this, saith his Maiesty, is a conclusion Contradictorie to his whole fiue Bookes of Iustification. This the Epistler endeuours to cure two waies; first, by 
                     thinking it strange, that FIVE Bookes should bee Contradictorie to ONE Proposition.
                   Hee should rather haue thought it to bee a very strange conclusion, which in so small a roomth, should haue matter to crosse a discourse

so large; as that's a strange poison, one scruple wherof infect's a whole riuer; and that Engine of Archimedes, a very strange instrument, which being but of a little compasse, Plutar. Marcel. with one wrest by a small force, would ouerthrow muniments and Bulwarkes of many dayes work, and the roiall strength of an whole Army: so THIS, a very strange proposition, which is of such force, as that it contradicts so many preceding reasons aduanc'd to the contrary; and that it is so, is manifest. For the chiefe and maine scope of al those Bookes is to prooue, that the righteousnesse wherwith we are iustified and for which we shal be rewarded is both VERA, true iustice, and inherent in vs; and also PERFECTA, able to stand and abide the triall of Gods iudgement; for to these two principall heads may all the

                  hief questions in that bulke of controuersie be reduced; e
                     •…
                  ther to the qualitie of our iustice, that it is inherent, not imputatiue, or of the merit, whether it be rewarded for the value of the worke, or of meere grace? And both these, by the first word of this Proposition, are directly cut off, for the vncertaintie there mentioned, is either Rei, or Personae, either of the righteousnesse it selfe, or of him which hath it: If of the thing it selfe, then is it no true righteousnesse; for truth, whether of essence or proprietie, cassieres all vncertaintie; and t'is hypocrisie, not righteousnesse, which is not true, if not righteousnesse, then not inherent. If it be of the Person, then the second part is cut off; for Merit raiseth a Considence, but where there is no Comfort, there can bee no Confidence, and in vncertainetie there is no Comfort; for reliance on that whereof a man doubts, causeth rather a feare to be deceiued, then a confidence to bee releeued; which also crosseth the very next precedēt proposition, Bellarmin. Eodem capite. that SOME Confidence may be reposed in our owne righteousnesse and good workes, if men be ASSVRED that they be good workes: but by this proposition in hand it seemes none can be assured; if they may, why doth he call it inc

If some may, and others not, hee should haue described and distinguished them; or else that fore-going proposition might well haue bin spared, which affoords little vse, and lesse comfort; and in that regard, is directly opposite to this last which is ful of confidence and consolation; and is the very same which the Prophet Dauid, renouncing all other helpes and hopes, (both in heauen and earth; in hea

               39 See wee then, if his second Cure bee more Souereign; in apparance it should be, the Emplaster applied is so large: for as before in the Councell of Toledo, so heere hee comes about, and fetcheth in a whole chapter out of Bellarmine, by Questions, and Solutions, but neither faithfully for the contents of the Chapter, nor soundly for the defence of his Master, nor sincerely for satisfaction of the Reader. For first, whereas hee saith, Num. 38. that the Chapter consists of three Questions, about Confidence to bee placed in good workes,  tis not so: there is but one onely Question propounded in the rubrick or title, and in that Chapter discussed, namely, QVATENVS, HOW FARRE FORTH a man may place confidence in his Merits: Which hee explaneth by three Propositions, that may very fitly bee compared vnto the three fatall Sisters 
                  Clotho. Lachesis. Atropos. which they cal Eumenidas, the last cutting off what the first carries, and the second twists.
               
               
                  
40. The first Proposition is, that the confidence towards God, which is in holy men, ariseth not out of faith alone, but out of their owne good workes and merites also. The second, that in good merits, which are TRVELY known so to bee, SOME confidence may be placed, if pride bee auoided. The third (which is the Atropos, & cuts off in a trice, the whole labour of the two former) is this crossing Proposition, by reason of the vacertainty of our owne righteousnesse, and hazzard of vain-glory, it is most safe to repose our WHOLE Confidence in the ALONE mercy and bounty of God; then which there cannot be any thing more violently contradicting, yea totally euerting the very principall question: For Quatenus implies that SOME confidence may bee placed in merit, but with a limitation tenus quâ; this last admits no confining, but drawes our WHOLE confidence from mans merit to Gods mercy ALONE, and carries with it a double contradiction, both Subiecti and Obiecti (so to speake.) The Subiect, TOTA fidu

                  In Psalm. wherein hee exempts no part nor facultie of himselfe, from that sanctifying and clensing power.
               41 The Obiect also affords a strong Contradiction, SO LA misericordia, mercie ALONE; which, beeing (as Aquin. 1. q. 31. 3. Aristo. Elench. lib. 2 cap. 3. Mat. 4. 10. Schoolemen obserue) an exclusiue speech, admits no participation with any other; for SOLVM est, quod cum alio non est. The verie force of which word, put the Tempter to silence and to flight also, Ei Soli, him ONLY shalt thou serue. Had the Cardinall said in the first place, mans Confidence must or may bee reposed in his owne MERITS and afterwards subioyned, mans Confidence must or may bee placed in Gods MERCY, these had not bin contradictorie but communicatiue; merit might haue parted stakes with mercy: but when hee addes in mercie ALONE; merit, & Saints, and Angels, and whatsoeuer beside, are abandoned & Cassiered for Solum admits no consort, saith Aquinas. Which Vbi supra. made Dauid to professe directly, Memorabor iustitiae tuae SOLIVS, I will remember thy righteousnesse ONLY; and Psal. 70. 16. 
                  Saint August. to insist vpon the same, both with an admiration, ô SOLIVS, and also with a question, Rogovos: I pray 
                  Aug. ibid. 
                  you, why should he adde this word SOLIVS: had it not bin enough for him to say, I will remember thy Righteousnesse? No, but SOLIVS prorsus, it ALONE altogether I will remember. Why so? Vbi meam non cogito, for in so saying I put out of my minde any righteousnesse which is mine owne. So then, TOTVM, WHOLE confidence, that takes away the particular ALIQVA, in his former proposition; SOLA excludes MERITVM in both propositions.
               42 What is then the cause of this Epistler his confidence,

to say 
                     that it cannot be any way defensible in the nature of a TRVE CONTRADICTION?  
                  Ignorance I thinke, which is the Mother (in the opinion of Fathers & Philosophers) of audacious assertions & vndertakings. HE perhaps, thinkes there is no contradiction, but where Nazian. Thucyd. & Plutarch. an vniuersall (if negatiue) is crossed with a particular affirmatiue; as thus, No Iesuite is a Traytor, Some Iesuite (as Parsons by name) is a Traytor: (if affirmatiue) with a particular negatiue; as thus, All Iesuits are Machiauel

                     el adiecto; of the first sort, are those examples aforenamed, wherein the negatiue note is expressed, as Omnis est; Aliquis non est: of the second sort are such as this in hand, where the note negatiue is omitted, and yet one member ouerthrowes an other. Take an instance which will please the Cardinall well; let the proposition be, Euery Bishope of Rome is (vnder Christ) the immediate and sole chiefe 'Pastor of the whole Church in the Christian world; this may be contradicted two waies; first, expresly, Some Bishop of Rome is not the immedi ate and sole chiefe Pastor, &c. This is a contradictory with the negatiue: Secondly, it may bee crossed by implication, as thus, the Patriarch of Constantinople is vnder Christ, the immediate and sole chiefe Pastor of the Easterne Church; this though it be a Contradictiō in apposito, yet doth it as mainly oppose the former generall proposition as if it had a negatiue note; and Bellarmine would take it so, and as much derogatorie to the High-priest of Rome as the other; yea more, for there is in this a double contradiction, both Subiecti and Praedicati: The Patriarch of Constantinople crosseth the Bishop of Rome, the Easterne Church and the whole world contradict each other implicitly.
               
               43 And this is our verie case in hand; had the Cardinall said, MANS WHOLE confidence is to be reposed in the
                  
ALONE mercy of God; and cro'st it with an other, thus: SOME confidence of man must NOT be placed in Gods mercie ALONE, this had beene a manifest negatiue contradiction: but vttering it thus: SOME confidence of a man must be placed in his OWNE MERITS, though it doe not so Negatiuely confront the former, it doeth as powerfully ouerthwart it, and as throughly ouerthrow it: take them then seuerally; WHOLE by it selfe, and ALONE by it self, the contradiction is irreconcileable: ioine them together, the iarre and dissonance is redoubled; for TOTA admits no partiall distribution in it selfe, & SOLA reiects all consorting participation with another. Therefore his Maiesties obseruation was iustly made, and Logike confirmes it to bee a violent contradiction; for these two propositions, Mans WHOLE confidence is to be placed in Gods mercy ALONE, and SOME confidence is to bee reposed in MANS MERIT, will no more agree (as being most opposite) then a new peece with an olde garment, which our Sauiour saith to be an incongruous impossibilitie. 
                  Mat. 9.
               
               44 And thus stands Bellarmines case in it selfe, but his Proctor the Epistler hath made it worse: for hee, supposing the Cardinall to handle the controuersie by questions and answeres (whereby it seemes hee neuer read the place himselfe) summes vp the Chapter by way of interrogation, and Solution, and makes Bellarmine, first to say, 
                     That good works in a Christian man, ioyned with the promise of reward, doe IN THEIR OWNE NATVRE encrease hope and confidence;
                    there beeing in the whole chapter no such thing. The Cardinals first proposition is, the considence which a Christian hath towards God, is not raised by Faith onely, but also by the good workes which he doth; for no Diuine (either Protestant or Papist) will say, that good workes encrease considence IN THEIR OWNE NATVRE, that opinion of a recent, but nameles Doctor, was condemned long since by the Bull of Pius Quintus, as Bellarmine

                     2
                  
reports; which causeth him often in those bookes of Iustification, to distinguish between good workes and merits, because all good workes are not meritorious, Si enim considerentur, ex NATVRA SVA, for if in THEIR OWNE NATVRE they should be considered, without respect both of the promise made vnto them, and also of the dignuie PRINCIPII OPERANTIS, of Gods spirit, the originall worker of them, they could carry NO MERIT with them, saith he, therefore by necessary consequent no considence could be raised by them, nor comfort taken in them Of their owne nature.
               
               45 Secondly, he makes Bellarmine to assoile another question thus A man may place ANY confidence WITTINGLY in his owne merits, so hee beware of Pride.
                    The Cardinall saith not so; but his second proposition is limited both in subiect and predicate, that SOME confidence may be placed in a mans good merits, if hee bee SVRE that they be TRVELY SVCH. For man is a self-louing creature, and because that affection interprets the owne actions partially, confidence may be wrongly placed, if the goodnes of the Act bee not throughly discerned and assured: the want wherof condemn'd the Pharises, supposing his workes to bee iust, which were not so; but the knowledge Luc. 18. Iob. 9. thereof made Iob to pronounce of himselfe verebar omnia opera mea, I feared ALL my Works: and good reason saith Gregorie, because the best workes haue attending on them, Grego. Moral. 9. cap. 26. 
                  two wormes, which gaster and infect the goodnesse of them, Defidiam and Frandem, Slouth and Deceit; either negligence in them, or pride of them, or some corrupt affection mingled with them.
               46 Now then ioyne the last proposition of the Cardinals (from whence this debate ariseth) with these of the Censurers, and see how he will make them hang together: First, our owne good workes haue such AN UNCERTAINTIE in them, as that our WHOLE confidence must bee referred to Gods mercie, saith the Cardinall: Our
                  
                  good, workes, IN THEIR OWNE NATVRE, are such, as that they may giue hope and considence of THEMSELVES, saith this Champion. Secondly, mans WHOLE confidence is to be placed in the mercy of God ALONE, sayeth Bellarmine: A man may WITTINGLY repose ANY confidence in his owne good workes, sayth Fa. Parsons. Betweene them both, they haue broched a goodly Doctrine, and very comfortable, no doubt: First, good works, of THEIR OWNE NATVRE, may raise vp our confidence towards God, and yet a man is UNCERTAINE whether they bee GOOD or no: Secondly, man must bee ASCERTINED that the workes he doth be TRVELY GOOD, or else he may NOT trust in them: and yet no

                  man can ASSVRE himselfe that they are SO, vnlesse he haue a REVELATION, sayeth the Cardinall: then which what is more VNCERTAINE? Sape fàllax, semper incerta, are his owne words. For that which seemes a Reuelation, may be an illusion: and as some superstitious people take that fire for a walking Spirit, which is but Iguis fat

               47 It was well done therefore of the Cardinall, to add this last Proposition, though it ouerthrow all his precedent Doctrine, whereby he leads men to the neerest and safest way, the alone mercy of God, oblitos meritorum praeteritorum, forgetting all their by-past merits; rather then to let the former stand vncontrouled, to procure despaire to distressed soules, as needs it must: and better were it for the Cardinall to acknowledgan ouersight in a long discourse, then to ouerthrow one souleredeemed by Christs blood.

                     if in THIS there be any CONTRADICTION, hee will yeeld, that the Apologer hath not OVERLASHED in the other,
                    Let the vnpartiall triall bee the seuere Iudge either way: and so wee come to the Second.
               
               49. Where the Cardinall saith in one and the same Chapter, that God doth not incline a man to euill, either naturally or MORALLY; and yet againe, that God inclineth a man to euill MORALLY; which is a manifest contradiction;

This Antilogie the Antapologer, Numb. 41, would salue by a figure in Grammar called Acyrologie, and would scarre vp the wound by an improprietie of speech; for that Morally in the second proposition is taken improperly: which if the Cardinall meant, he expresseth not: and then (like a Sphinx) he propounds Riddles, he reads not Lectures: but that it was not his meaning, is most plaine; because what the Epistler calleth an IMPROPERLY morall inclining or commanding, is (as the Cardinall sets it downe) not subordinate to that which he before had simply called MORALLY inclining; but membrum diuidens, a seuerall member by it selfe, distinguished and diuers from the former.
               50. For thus Bellarmine makes his Diuision: All impelling or inclining others to euill, is, first, either NATVRALLY, by 
                        •…
                     ouing the wil immediately; or MORALLY, by truly and PROPERLY commanding: or else secondly, PERMISSIVELY, by suffering an euill to be wrought,
                  
                  which is a TROPICALL kinde of commaund: or else, thirdly, DESERTIVELY, by leauing those open to the euill, which are proposed and appointed to bee ann
                        •…
                     iea therwith: or fourthly, ORDINATIVELY, which hee takes from Hugo, by disposing the will of an euill man to this or that Act; not positiuely, but by permission. From the first hoe exempts God wholly, that he neither NATVRALLY nor MORALLY inclines; the three last may be verified in him: to which he also addes (Super podij loco; as an ouer-weight) a distinction out of Aquinas, His autem addipotest, &c. that Ia Rom. 9. if the other will not serue, God yet may be said to incline a man vnto euill OCCASIONALITER, indirectly and by occasion not naturally mouing the will, but MORALLIE immitting and senaing in some good thought, whereby the wicked man takes an OCCASION to doe this or that euill. If then the Cardinall, when he spake of MORALLY inclining, had sub-diuided it into MORALLY PROPER, and MORALLY OCCASIONATE or IMPROPER, and had freed God from the first, but laid this last vpon him, then had the Apologer wrōged him, and himselfe had not beene so wrung, as by his name (Tortus) it seemes he is; but this he did not, nay, he meant it not: for he makes truly and properly to bee the difference constitutiue of MORALLY inclining, as if otherwise it were not so to be tearmed: for proprie makes it differ from the permissiue, which Bellarmine himselfe saith to be a figuratiue and IMPROPER inclining or Commaundement: wherby lie is also fallen into a gro
                     •…
                  le absurdity in Logicke confounding members diuided, and making disparatum dici de disparato.
               
               51. Whoso reads the place, euen with partiality for the Cardinals credit, may thus perhaps explaine the Cardinals sense (and the Epistler slutters about it) that God doth not MORALLY incline man to euill in GENERAL, but to doe THIS euill rather then THAT, he doth MORALLY incline the will; not as Author of the corruption,
                  
                  but disposer of the order. For example, that Clemens the Monke should rather stab a King, then poison the Pope (for the Priests say he left that to the Iesuites;) which is as much, as if he should say; it is impiety and blasphemy to auerre that God Morally incliues the will to murther in generall, but to murder Kings rather then ordinary men, or this King rather then an other, God doth Morally incline: (the Doctrine we examine not; we are now to trie Contradictions, not to handle Controuersies) this, I say, may expound the Cardinalls meaning, but it no way reconciles the Contradictory propositions: much lesse are they salued by the Censurers aduerbe Improperly; for whether in the Order, or in the Matter of the euill, MORALLY inclining is that only (as Bellarmine describes it, and was touched before) which is truely, properly, and directly: and yet, lest the Cardinall should seem thus to distinguish without his Author (as hee doth indeed) he cunningly thrusts in Moraliter, and ioines it in Aquinas his speech (who hath no such word in that place) with Occasionaliter; which two will as well agree together, as Moses his Oxe & Asse in one yoake. Deut. 22. 10.
               
               52. The third and fourth follow, which the Epistler crouds vp together in one Numb. 44. the first, That Bishops doe succeed the Apostles, and yet Bishops doe not properlie succeed the Apostles; and least any should thinke that this Bellar. de cler. lib. 1. cap. 14. De Rom. Pontif. li. 4. ca. 25. is no Antilogy because in the last proposition the Aduerbe [properly] qualifieth it, the Cardinall himselfe hath in the very next precedent Chapter preuented that, where hee saith, that Bishops doe PROPERLY succeed the Apostles: then which, what more strong counter-shock can De cler. lib.

good Councell Nauiget Anticyras, for sure his brain wants purging.
               53 The controuersie canuazed in that Chapter which hath the affirmatiue proposition is, Whether Bishops and Priests bee equall or no? that they are not, but that Bishops are Superior vnto them, Bellarmine shewes three waies. First, in respect of order; Secondly, of Iurisdiction; Thirdly, of the principalitie and precedencie in all ancient Sessions and assemblies of Priests. Hauing ratified the first (for Episcopall ORDER) he comes to the second, concerning their Superiority in IVRISDICTION, Quod ad secundum, &c. For confirmation whereof, he brings his first argument from the Analogie and patterne of the Priesthood in the old Testament; but the second reason hee fetcheth, is, for their power of Iurisdiction, out of the new Testament: because they haue THE SAME which the Apostles had, Nam episcopos Aposto lis succedere, that Bishops doe succed the Apostles THEREIN, is not one mans testimonie alone, but constanter docent omnes patres, saith hee, all the Fathers doe hold it with one consent, without varying in themselues, or differing from others.
               
               54 If hee stand vpon the other place where the negatiue is, there indeed the Cardinall (driuen to his shifts) is forced to coine this distinction (but how vnfortunately, he, whose name (though dead) like Zisca his Drum, is a VVhitaker de Rom. Pontif. Qu. 8. Contro. 4. terror to Bellarmine, doth at large discusse:) but yet that salues not the Contradiction, but makes it greater; for therin hee sheweth that hee manifestly opposeth both himselfe and all the Fathers: for in superioritie of Iurisdiction, Bishops (by the testimonie of all the Fathers) succeede the Apostles, as himselfe confesseth, prooueth and approoueth in this place.
               55 The fourth is concerning Iudas; of whose qualities to discusse, whether hee were iust before his Election, or made good by the choice, and how long he countinued so; whether (as Tertullian saith ad loculorum officium, till hee

                  is Sinne. All this the Epistler takes vpon him to cure with a short and present remedie, and that is, 
                     by Aequiuocation of Times, for in THE BEGINNING (saith he) Iudas BELEEVED, and then hee was TRVELIE good; but after that, he fell both from Faith and goodnes.
                  
               
               58 Yet well fare an old acquaintance, a friend at need; Aequiuocation hath a facultie to make treacherie and periurie appeare no vices; Iudas and Iesuites to be honest men: but yet he that wil make a concord of a iarr by distinguishing times, should particularize the difference into their se uerall seasons: which the Epistler did wel to omit, because he could not doe it. For though it be but a coniecturall calculation what in that time should bee spoken (there being no direct place of Scripture for it) yet to iustifie his Euasion, he should haue taken that course, or haue sought some other remedy. But if Scripture might determine, it is probable rather, that Iudas NEVER beleeued, and take

no other but that very place which Bellarmine quotes, for the time of his vn-beleefe, namely when Saint Peter made Mat. 16. that confession, Thou art Christ &c. which was not long after our Sauiour had begun to shew himselfe by preaching and miracles vnto the world: which because it was new and fresh, it raised an admiration and extraordinary fame of him, concerning which our Sauiour then made an inquiry with his Disciples, (for long continuance of any thing, slakes the wonderment, and makes the wings of report to flag) De Pontif. Rom. li. 1. ca. 12. yet euen THEN Iudas beleeued NOT, saith the Cardinall: nay before that time (as some in their H
                        •…
                     rmonies doe place it) when S. Peter in the name of the rest, made that Ioh 6. 69. profession, Nouimus & Credimus, WE know and beleeue that 
                  Ibid. ex Chrys. 
                  thou art Christ the Sonne of the liuing God; the opinion of some Fathers is, and Bellarmine approues it, that he spake not then in the person of Iudas, nor that Iudas his heart did agree with Saint Peters word, nor gaue his consent to that nos Credimus.
               
               59 When was then that BEGINNING wherin the Epistler saith, Iudas beleeued? There is a place auaileable (at least probable) for the contrary, that there was no beginning of his Releefe, for the Euangelist saith, that Iesus knew 
                  Ioh. 6. 64. 
                  from the BEGINNING which they were that BELEEUED NOT, and who should betray him: which beginning take it either for Moses his Bereshith a beginning temporall, Gen. 1 the Incarnation of our Sauiour; or Saint Iohns in Principio

                     de when our Sauiour began to preach and chose his Disciples, hee then at all these times knew who beleeued not, and who should betray him: the not beleeuing he puts in the presēt tense (as if he should say, hee then knew who did not presently beleeue, not who should or would not beleeue) and this hee imputes to all the flinchers that forsooke him; but vpon Iudas hee laies a double loade, both of a present incredulitie, and of a future Treason: & both these he knew to be the beginning,
                  
scil. that Iudas did not beleeue, and that he would betray. Yea, it seemes that Iudas beleeued rather in the END then in the beginning; for

                  , with the Halter in his hand he confessed more then when hee had the bag in keeping, namely that the blood which hee had betrayed was innocent and guiltlesse 
                  Mat. 27. 4. 
                  blood. If the Censurer had had but the shadow of such a place for Iudas his beleefe in the beginning, we should haue heard of it with a Triumph, as of Nicholas Deaconship, and Saint Paules conuersion.
               
               60 But grant it true that he did beleeue at the first; was his faith FORMATA, that which is formed by grace, and worketh by loue, and is the true life of a iust man (Iustus ex fide viuit?) surely in him which hath that, saith Aquinas, 
                  Abac. 2. In Rom. 14. 
                  nihil inest Damnationis, for being once had, it cannot bee totally and finally lost; nor is it more separable from him, then the essentiall forme of any thing from the subiect which it denominates. Was it fides INFORMIS a generall apprehension, an Historicall Faith? (as it was indeede) that could not denominate him to bee a Iust man, much lesse VERE Iustum; for such a Faith is common both to vniust Hypocrites, and vniustified Reprobates, and in sound Diuinitie NO Faith at all.
               61 And so much for the Contradictions; for here the Censurer thought good to leaue with his fellow Iudas; transmitting that of Antichrist to the Cardinall himselfe, with the rest of the Antilogies. The wisest part that euer he plaide, for these are no matters of State; but being points of learning (and so out of his element) he is weary of them. Yet, least he should seeme to doe it for want of skill, he giues a double reason thereof: First, That hee should WRONG the Cardinal;
                    t'is very likely, for if Bellarmine can vnderstand what great paines, and little ski

               62 And therfore frō his didacticall, we must now follow him to his Historicall skill. For, his Maiestie, to giue some answer to that Sarcasticall obiection of Bellarmine concerning that imputation of CAVSELES FEARE, for that no Christian King is, or euer was affraid of the Pope, sheweth by diuers instances (ancient and modern) what other Emperors and Kings haue done, who in feare of him haue vndecently stooped (whether voluntary by themselues, or compulsiutly by meanes) to the Popes proud insolencies. In citing whereof, this Censurer saith Hee finds such a deale of exaggerations, wrestings, additions, and vnsincerities, that he is not able to refute them;
                    and yet that he may confute them, he begins at the wrong end first, scil. with the Example of King Henry the fourth of France that now is.
               63 (For this you must know to be Parsons veine, if it be matter of ancient Story, wherof there are substantiall Testimonies, by authority of Writers, (their own specially) them hee casteth off, as the fellow in Athenaaeus did his spectacles, these are too true for my false eyes: his Rhetorike cannot there roule, to adde, or depraue, or detort, or defalke, because hee shall be espied: but if it be a moderne Pl

he killed himselfe) now I am mine owne man, and where I would bee; wherein, if there bee any thing that may touch the Popes tyranny, all the excuses, blandishments, extenuations, and pretenses that may be, are heaped together for the qualifying thereof; for hee may safely doe it, in that there is no author extant to controle him, & the eye-witnesses at Rome must vnderpin any tale for the Apostolike credit.)
               64 And that made him begin with this particular of the French King, whome his Maiesty (for a demonstration of his feare, in regard of the Pope) instanceth, that to haue the excommunication reuoked, he suffered his Embassador to bee WHIPT at Rome for penance, Which the Epistler hooteth at 
                     for a manifest vntruth, and propounds is to be laught at for a monstrous assertion, and which will ouerthrow (in his Mathematicall imagination) the PVNCTVALL sidelity of the rest: for that there are eye witnesses, at Rome, which can testifie that the Embassador was not WHIPT with a Rod, but a white WAND was laid on his apparrell SOFTLIE, in token of submitting himselfe to Ecclesiasticall Discipline.
                   Which answere of his hath more disgrac'd his Holy Master, then his Maiesties assertion: for was it not for penance that the Embassador was so ceremoniously strooken? and is not penance the seuerest part of Ecclesiastical discipline? veniam ad vos in virga was 1. Cor. 4. 21. no sporting threat of the Apostle.

Moses called Aarons Rod, while it was a Serpent, and then deuouring the rest, by the name of a Rod, and not of a Serpent; and (which sits this Tragicomicall play best) the Poets, bringing Hercules vpon the stage, do call that which he hath vpon his shoulder, and is but a light compound of painted cloth and reed, by the name of his Clab, and describe it for the weight, compasse, and stifnesse thereof: so also this assertion, that the sending of his Embassador to be thus handled in his stead, argued THAT Kings feare and the Popes tyrannie, is PVNCTVALLY, lineally, and in all dimensions true, though the Penance were plaid but superficially. For that which draue the King to that submission, was nothing else, but feare of those vsuall Earth-quakes, which concomitate the Popes Thunderbolts, and are the concurrent Meteors of the Romish Region either his Subiects Reuolt, or populous Tumults, or intestine Insurrections, or defeizances of Succession, or personall Assault (whereof Bariere gaue him some taste, and Chastile another, as the Priests declare at large.)

in token of their submission, should obtaine the fauour to haue the Rope changed into a Ribben; the silken lace shewes their seruile homage, no lesse then the hen penhalter. For the principall end of Discipline is SHAME, the smart is not so much; and that was as great and as famous by the wand laid on, as if it had beene the Iash of Rods: yea more terror would it haue strucken into Christian Princes (since they wil needs stoope to such indignities, and debase that three-fold Image of God in them; in their birth, of freedome; in their baptisme, of Christianitie; in their place, of Souereignty) and more credit for the Popes discipline to haue it done in the right kinde, and vpon the offenders owne body; for the Kings of Israel and Nineue did the penance themselues: and more wisely had this Censurer and his Master Tortus done, to haue let his Maiesties word of whipping passe vncontrouled, that the world might haue knowen, that the Pope will not suffer the contempt of his fearfull Anathema to be redeemed so easily (I will not say so cheape) with the tap of a Wand, vpon another mans cloke that neuer offended. But heereby Christians may see, that in Rome, as the Sacraments, so the Discipline is made but a meere pageant; they to allure the senses of carnall men, this to fill the Treasury of an vnsatiable Priest: both of them to establish the monarchie of an oultrecuidant Pope.

                     ction was the Kings feare of the Pope; wherein the most Authors concurre. For the Pope was so inraged against the King about the death of Becket (that most vnthankfull Prelate, wholly made, and raised only by the Kings grace) that when the king had sent his Embassadors to Rome to cleere him of the guilt, either by command of it, or consent to it, the Pope would not admit them to his Kisse, not to his Feete, not to Mat. Paris. in Hen. 2 his Sight: and being sent the second time, the Cardinals enterteined them with words only, no other welcome; but so farr they were from being admitted to the Popes audience, that he was determined (hauing the consent of some Cardinals) vpon Maundy-Thursday, then at hand, to haue ACCVRSED the King by name at the high Altar, and to haue interdicted his Realme, had not some other Cardinals assured the Pope, that those Ambassadors were sent of purpose to take an Oath, both to cleere the King their Master from that murder, & also to signifie that he wold obey whatsoeuer the Pope & his Cardinals shold enioine him: which notwithstanding the Pope was so farre from beleeuing, vt etiam contra at que illi dixerint, that, being Polydor Virg. in Hen. 2. perswaded that all things were cleane contrarie to that which they auowed, hee sent his Legats into Normandie, with full authority both for examination of the Fact, and

                  mandate of Satisfaction by penance. This was all that his Maiestie intended, and which he vndertooke to specifie; that it was the feare of the Popes Interdiction, that made the King thus to stoope, and deiect himself: which because the Censurer could not controle, hee frames a Question where none needs, 
                     Whether the Pope INIOINED the WHIPPING Penance, yea or no?

And is not this good dealing, when there are so many authors of credit in print to auow the Story, one Manu-script, vncoth, obscure Writer must encounter the credit of them all cited by Baronius (a very sincere Relator, no doubt) to salue the reputatio of his Masters Holinesse?

sefe) in the second Person; THOV shalt walke, &c. HE for the Popes glory, makes him pronounce it in the First, Ambulabo, I shall or will walke vpon the Lion and the Adder. Notwithstanding all these, wee must appeale to Baronius; to whom if we should goe for trial (let al things be vnpartially weighed) the Relation of so many Authours will be more probable, then the omission of that particular (by an obscure corner-creeping Relator, presented like a Puppet to speake what his Prompter will haue him; yet therein lieth his maine force of argument) will be auaileable to the contrarie.

Secondly, in his censure of the Storie it selfe his argmments are all (without wresting) easily retortible against him; as first, Ronwaldus who was present at the Acts, and wrote the storie, dooth NOT MENTION it; a weake reason: for a narratiue discourse, is no forcible confutation, and an omission of a circumstance by One single man, falsifieth not the credit of many mens Relations; and to argue from authority negatiuely is but a silly peece of Logike: three Euangelists omitte the storie of the repenting theefe, yet is Saint Lukes

Thirdly saith he, If the Pope had so done, it had beene an action monstrous for the vnseemclinesse, wonderfull for the strangenesse, singular for the Nouelty: therefore the more beseeming and likely for the Pope, who, being THAT Antichrist, exalts himselfe aboue all that is called God. Fourthly, that had beene the way to haue exacerbated the
                  
                  Emperor, and driuen him from penance, saith he. True, but rage expels discretion, and reuenge admits not of religious Cautions; the Pope was then thorowly incensed▪ for hauing taken Uenice (in a Cookes habit) for his refuge, and being thither pursued by the Emperor, and hauing fast in custody the Emperors Sonne, who (contrary to his Fathers Commandement) fighting before his time limited, was taken captiue; t'is most probable, that (hauing gotten this start) by the Sonnes restraint, he would handle the Father somewhat coursly, vpon his former pursuits, and this present aduantage: as Hawkes seize vpon those fowles with most eagernesse, which haue put them to the longest flight, and the oftnest retriues. For had not the Emperor, vpon the sonnes intreaty, and tendring his present state, yeelded to the peace, hee must haue returned a Childlesse Father. His fift argument, which is by admiration of Gods prouidence (for stabbing and trampling vpon Kings is al now referred to that lofty Common-place) that could make so CRVELL APERSECVTOR, who hadset vp an Anti-pape thrice, and promulged DEADLY EDICTS against the Popes authoritie, should bee brought so LOW, as to hold the Popes STIR-VP after the Reconciliation, makes it more likely that the Pope would debase him yet more vilely in the very Act of his Submission. Sixtlie, his Insultation vpon the Emperor in those high termes and vnsitting comparisons, do make for the punctuall truth of the Popes Conculcation: for if Baronius, being but a Cardinall, a Story-writer, and a Library-keeper, cannot (without indignation) passe his Censure of the Emperor, now dead 500. yeeres since almost, nor forbeare to call him Tyrannicall Persecutor, comparing him to Pharaoh, to

                  An. 1160. n. 35. 
                  of Pride; it is most probable, that the Pope himselfe, who felt the rigor of the Emperors puissance, & was but newlie stripp't of his Cookes apparell (not at all from his choler
                  
and former terror) would, when hee had him at his feete (kissing and licking them, as Baronius himselfe confesseth else where, and triumpheth in it) not sticke to compare him to a Lion and a Basiliske, hauing a Text (as he thought) fi

                   for it. But that which he addes, of the Emperors Reuolt 
                  Ibid. 
                  after Reconcilement, is an inuincible demonstration, that either the former Submission was forced and inuoluntary, and onely in respect of his Sonnes redemption: or that hee was indeede (though for the time he supprest it) exasperate at the insolent Conculcation and vsage of the Pope in the acting of his penance.
               77 And so much for that storie, and Baronius too; vnto whom the Censurer remitting vs, (if his authoritie be so irrefragable) it hath wrought vs this benefit, that we shal abridge the next Instance which his Maiestie bringeth, of the Popes putting on, and striking off (with his foote) the Emperors Diadem at his Coronation. For howsoeuer this silly Antapologer would glide it off, because it hath but two Testimonies, one borrowing it from the other  (thats more by one, then the Lybrary-Cardinal brought to confute the former stories) yet Baronius assumes it for a truth, & graceth it with a Symbolical Hieroglyphik, expressing what the Anno. 1191. sect. 10. Pope should meane in dooing so: but still all this makes for his Maiesties purpose and argument, that both the Emperors did what they did, in awe & feare of the Pope.
               78 The next instance which his Maiestie bringeth, is of Philip the Emperor, elected against the Popes liking, in the minoritie of his Nephew Frederick the second. And that the Pope liked him not, there are two proofes; first his proud threate, that either HE would weare no Miter, or Philip should weare no Crowne; Secondly, that hee set vp Otho the Duke of Saxony against him, whom hee abetted in his pursuite, and crowned him after he had SLAINE Philip. This in two words, breefely, but smartly the Epistler calleth a MEERE SLANDER, because not Otho the Emperor, but another Otho of WHITLESPACK,a PRIVATE man, did SLAY him.
 Mistaking of a person, where two of one name concur in the same storie (if it bee not wilfull may bee censured for a negligence, but not improoued to a Slander. And who so reades that history of Garboile caused by the Pope (for therein all that write, consent) may easily be deceiued in the two Othoes; neither of them both being a priuate n ā the one Duke of Saxonie, the other a Count Palatine, or (as Fascic. tempor. an. 1204. some will haue him) a Lantsgraue: both of them espoused to one and the same Daughter of Philip, & each of them so neere allied to her, that they could neither of them Naucler. Gen. 41. 1208. Krantz. sax. lib. 7. cap. 29. 
                  lawfullie marrie her: which circumstances considered, t'is an easie matter to mistake the word, ab Othonedolose interfectus, hee was deceitfully SLAINE by OTHO; and without attentiue diligence, hard to say vnto which of them both to ascribe it.
               79 But yet his Maiestie is not so incurious in perusing stories, as to commit euen such a slip; for hee did not say hee was slaine by Otho the Emperors HANDS, but that Otho SLEW him; which may bee referred to his meanes as well, or rather then to his hands: euen as when Eliah reprooued Ahab about the death of Naboth, and asked him with indignation, Hast THOV SLAINE and also taken possession? when as Ahab meddled not therein, 1. Reg. 21. 19. further then consenting to his wiues wicked plot, (if so far:) did the Prophet thereby reprooue him as the Actor or as the procurer thereof? And that it was by Otho the Emperors vnder-hand meanes (as things then stood) there are strong presumptions: First, their hatred in pursuite each of other was for an Empire: Secondly, it issued out into blood, and with open & often battailes eagerly followed, still with Otho his ouerthrow and disgrace. Thirdly, their Reconciliation was but fresh and newly made; wherein, by Salomons rule, there is not much trust to be reposed; for hatred

               82 Yea, 
                     but the Author (saith the Epistler) whome ONELY the Apologer citeth, is plaine for his murther by the COVNT, not by the EMPEROVR.
                   For the Count he is plaine; of the Emperour hee saith nothing. Silence omits the relation, excuseth not the guilt: neither dooth his Maiestie cite him for IT, but for that comminatorie speech of the Pope, that either he would loose his Miter or Philip should loose his Crowne. 
                  
                     Urspergensis writes that but for a REPORT, saith the Epistler;
                   no more did Cuspinian THAT, when he saith, that Gregory the seuenth absolued Henrie the fourth, before he died; and yet Parsons Numb. 29. insisteth vpon that (though but an Hearesay) as a strong argument to ridde the Pope from being reputed as a Persecutor of that Emperor.
               83 But to this Report Urspergensis addes (quoth hee) quod non est credendum, which is not to be beleeued:
                   that's not so; he saith, that what he heard was an hard thing to bee related, and UIX credendum, SCARCELY WOVLD be beleeued. But doeth that excuse the Pope, or exempt him from so saying? yea rather, it dooth exaggerate the Popes pride and malice, that would deliuer such a speech, which being written and TRVE, yet men would HARDLIE beleeue it: (not that it is any strange thing with Popes to vtter words, and perpetrate facts, for their Abomination,

               84 Neither doth the Abbots relation onely, but the Popes Acts also, verifie the report. For first, that hee neuer loued Philip, in that ALL writers doe agree: Secondly, he depriued the Arch-Bishop of Colen for Crowning him, and put Bruno in his roome: Thirdly, he denied to giue any Arch-Bishop

Graujoribus IPSE vinculis teneretur, hee would lay sorer and heauier bonds vpon HIM: Lastly, Quamuis NON sit credendum saith Urspergensis, although men will not beleeue that the Pope would vtter that strangely proud threat aboue mentioned, as if thereby hee would pin

And now what's become of this meere SLANDER, which is grounded vpon such strong presumptions, as well for Philips death by Otho his Competitor, as also for the Popes Insolence in making such a proude vow? both which do still ratifie what his Maiestie intendeth, the Awe that Popes kept Emperors in at those times; for it was only the feare of him that made Philip to release Crantz. lib. 7.

Cuspinian Petrus de Uineis, and Matheus Parisiensis; of which, the two last liued in that Emperors time: yea, two of the authors marginated by the Epistler, incline that way. Nauclerus mentioneth the poison, but will not determine it; not that Gen. 42. Anno. 1247. it was not so, but because diuers Authors report it diuersly, so that a man knoweth not which is the truest, saith he: & of that minde is Binnius, seeing the variance of writers, de

87 But all, or most agree, saith the Epistler, that hee was 
                  STIFLED with a pillow by Manfredus the Emperours base Sonne. Not all, nor the most, for they cannot agree either of the person, place, or kinde of his death; but graunt it true, what then? Therefore hee dyed not of the POISON: that's no good consequent: for a mans death may bee effectuate by two meanes, though one more speedy & visible. Abimelech was slaine by a Woman, and yet his Iudg. 9. 54.

Siue morbo, siue veneno, extinctus est; whether by a disease, or by Poison, hee dyed, saith Nauclerus: And Cuspinian agrees with them, that Anno. 1247. Cuspi. Fred. 2. the Emperor recouering by the helpe of Phisitions from the poison, Manfrede tooke a shorter course with him; and (as Hazael scrued Benhadad with a cloath) stop't his breath 2, Reg. 8. 5. with a pillow. Where is now then the Fabulosity of this assertion? and what audaciousnesse is this, to intitle that for a  Talewhen his Maiestie hath so many Authors (and all of them Papists) to direct him to this auerment?
               88 But belike, the malice of this tale is inexcusable, by laying it vpon the Pope, who was free from it. No Author freeth him, the onely freedome which they giue him, is their silence of him; saue onely one who acquits him thus, that Matth.

It seemes by this Censurer, that three exceptions may be taken Ibid. against him. First, Hee is but one for Cuspinian borrowed what hee had for that point, from HIM, and none else.

Thirdly, neither did Vineis write that discourse as a Seruant, but as an Historian, who in all his Tract must haue an eie to the truth, without which, an Historie (as Po lybius well resembles it) is like a liuing body with all the bones taken out: which (it seems) this Gentleman did wel know; Lib. 2. for, as it appeares by Cuspinian, he dissembles not euen the foule vices of the Emperor his Master.
               94 Which might preuent the third Obiection of this Epistler, who saith, 
                     that he wrote so partially in this matter, that the Pope was faine to write LIBROS APOLOGETICOS, BOOKES of APOLOGIE to cleere himselfe.
                     And HIS bookes must goe for currant without contradiction, being in defence of his owne particular acts; but his Maiestie writing an Apologie against a defaming Inuectiue of a Cardinall, about the OATH of Allegeance, framed by the Councell and wisedome of the whole State for his Maiesties safety, and triall of his true Subiects, that must be encountred with a Tortus in Latine, and a Traitor in English, and may not passe vncontrolled. But who can witnesse that the Pope wrote those Books? Blondus, saith he, recorded it. And HEE the most glozing Recorder that euer the Pope had; who for his extreme flatteries of the Papal Miter, is vsually called Blandus, the onely painfull Pseudolus of any Historian that writ many a day; Secretarie to a Pope, and liuing two hundred yeares after Innocentius. But did the Pope write those Bookes in defence of himselfe, to confute Petrus de Uineis? Surely that's an argument that hee was guilty: Suspi

                   True, for the NEXT Storie immdiately following, but the Printer misplaced him, giuing him a higher roome by fiue lines in the page then he should haue. An error or slip at the Presse, is not a Calumniation in the Author; if it be, then Medice teipsum; for if the Reader turne but only one leafe backe (in pag, 100. of this Epistlers Censure) the very like escape, for all the world, will appeare in himselfe: for in Numb. 49. speaking of King Henry the Second of England his WHIPPING at Beckets Sepulcher, the marginall note wills vs to See BARONIVS in Anno MCLXXVII. there to receiue a Confutation of that inioned Penance: searching the place, wee finde no syllable of any such thing; for that point he discusseth in An. 1174. so that the note of Anno 1177. is to be brought downe to the next Instance of Frederik Barbarossa, for that's the place indeed, where Baronius doth tumble himselfe in that Storie.

So that, had there beene any grace or good nature in this Antapologer, if hee read (as he faith he did) the second booke of Iouius, and found not this, but the next succeeding Storie there, hee might presently haue discouered the Printers slip, giuen a touch at it, and confuted the Obiection: but because, in likelihood, hee saw it vncontroulable, all the Answer he makes, is, t'is a Calumniation, for hee findes it not in IOVIUS.

               97. As he doth manifestly, in the very next example; with the euident & confirmed truth whereof being conuicted, that Pope Alexander the Sixt caused the Turkes brother to be poisoned, he first confesseth, that THIS hath MOST APPARANCE of truth, only because OTHER Authors, besides Cuspinian, who is quoted in the margin of the Apologie, concurre therein,
                    Belike then if it had come alone, though Iouius bee a Popish Bishop, and doe at large particularize euery circumstance, it must not haue past; for euen as it is, he makes it but an APPARANCE; whereas the rule of Almightie GOD is, that if the testimonie of two witnesses speak with one mouth, in 
                  Deut. 19. 15. 
                  ore duorum, it shall bee an Establishment, and that is more then an apparance of truth. In the case of Frederick the Second, Vineis and Cuspinian were both produced to confirme one Storie; that could not serue the turne, because they were but One (the last borrowing what he said, from the formost:) In this Instance there are two different Witnesses, which concurre in verifying of one and the same fact; and this, though thus seconded, is slightly turn'd off, as 
                     making but an APPARANCE. But it will be found, that with this their Apparance, they will also giue in such Euidence of an irreligious treacherie, as could not be imagined

would enter the hart of any that professed Religion: scz. that the High Priest of Christendome (so he would bee called) at the request of a Mahometan Turke, for a bribe of money, and (which is a horrible, yet a ridiculous thing Paul. Iouius, lib. 2. to heare) in exchange of Christs vnseamed Coat (for wee must thinke the Souldiers, at our Sauiour his passion, cast lots to haue it kept for the Greate Turke, to be reserued by him for a Relique 1500. yeares after) should poison a Prince committed to his refuge and protection, to satiate the thirst of a blood-golofer, and secure him in his Tyranny: for did hee not hereby giue a iust occasion to the Turke, bothrto blaspheme our Sauiour, and scoffe at Christianity? that, as once his owne Disciple betraied him to death for a peece of mony, his deare Vicar would now poison an innocent man (and in whose life remained great hope for the good of all Christendome, as their owne Writers record) for the exchange 
                  Onuphr. Alex. 6. 
                  of a mocke roabe; a Relique which must needes performe great wonders, being thus purchased with the price of blood: as also brag that Christendome was beholden to him for her principall Reliques; for before, he had sent the Speare that S. Longies pierced our Sauiour withall, and Iouius, ibid. now they should haue THIS Coat. His second answere therefore is, that Writers set it downe doubtfully and suspitiously.

The most doubtfull Reporter is Sabellicus, who saith that there were that BELEEVED he died of poison, and that the Pope caused it, &c. which doubt (if it bee any) must not only be referred to the Author that procured his death,

but to the matter also that caused it, which was neuer questioned; for al agree that it was poison, saue only Onuphrius, who, indeed, mentioneth not the poison, but names a disease as an effect thereof, a disentery or continued looseness

                  Iouius describes it; which was so prepared, as that it should spend him slowly, but speed him throughly. But Guicciardine stoppes not at it, who auers it for vndoubted that he was poisoned, and by the Popes meanes too. Yea, saith the Epistler but he giues a reason why it was so reported, because the corrupt nature of the Pope made any wickednes to bee beleeued of him. (Christ had a good Vicar in the meane time, and Saint Reter a worthy Successor; might not the Church truelie haue then complained Caput meum doleo?)
               
               99 It is true that Guicciardine giues many reasons, not of the report, but of the ground therof, why the Pope should doe it; and they all make singularly to the excuse and credit

Ducats yearely; This Gobbet the Pope lost, being inforced to part with Gemen to the French King, and that vexed him into the purpose for the poison, and into the practise too. Secondly, he tooke pleasure with himselfe (so much good it did him) to thinke how he had co
                        •…
                     sened the King that got him; who looking for the same annual allowance, should so quickly be eased of it by Gemens death. Thirdly, he enuied at the glorie which the French-King should get, hauing that Prince in his possession, by whose meanes he might con quer the Turke so easily and speedily. Fourthly, he was in bodily feare that the French-King succeeding well in those warres against the Turke, (whereof there was little doubt, Gemen being with him) would after the return frō that battell, set vpon his skirts, and looke into the Reformation of the Church: the abuses wherein (it beeing wholly aliened from the ancient deuotion-custome, and puritie of the
                  
                  primtiue state) had brought the Religion of Christ into Contempt Lastly, because the Pope had good cause thus to feare, therefore he also thought the poison was very necessarie (for nothing preuenteth Reformation more speedelie then poison doth): His entrie into the Papacie by wicked meanes, made all the world expect no better, but a more corrupt state of the church, day after day, and that the Pope knew wel enough. These are the reasons which that faithfull Historian coucheth together; and are by him alleaged, not so much to iustifie his speech that there was such a report, but to necessitate the author, that it must needes be the Pope that acted it.
               100 After which, a ioynt fame being spred de Motore, that some body should instigate the Pope to doe it, and the opinion concurring that it was by the great Turkes motion, who had corrupted the Popes Legate Bucciardin to sollicite his Master thereunto; Guicciardine addeth to this (for Vbi supra. that it was so horrible) that the nature and ha

                     or of the Pope was so Wicked, that there was no conceit (though neuer so detestable) but Alexanders WICKEDNES was capable of it, and able to make it sound true. And yet for all this, the Epistler saith, That this matter is but doubtfully and suspiciously related,
                    then the which, there cannot be of any in Storie (to vse his own words) a more assertiue affirmation, then Cuspinian, Iouius and Guicciardin haue made; who, both categorically & constantly, do auouch it. And heere, as before with that trustie Disciple IVDAS he ended his contradictions; so with this honest Pope, ALEXANDER, hee closeth vp these Instances, which his Maiestie rehearseth to Iustifie his owne wari
                        •…
                     es, rather then feare; since so many Emperors and Kings haue felt with smart (and sometimes their ruine) the rage and reuenge of the Popes MALICE.
               
               101 As for all particulars of those plunges, which our late Queene of happy memorie was driuen into by succeeding Popes; as also of his Maiesties owne motiues to this

                  warines, by the Pope both his engines of cruelty, & indulgence of lenity; the first, his debarring Bulls at his Maisties entrie, and his barrelled Bullets after his inuestitute: the other, that though the principal Agents and plotters thereof were the Popes Mancipia, Iesuits, (so confessed by some of that sort that died for it) yet neyther the Pope wold cal them that sled away and escaped, to account for it; nor fasten any note of Obloquie or infamy vpon them which acted it, and were executed for it: Of all this, I say, (his owne conscience bearing him witnesse it is too true) hee is wholly silent, and so passeth to the third parte of the Cardinalls letter. But first hee must giue a parting blow,  by a ijrking Comparison of Kings with Popes,
                  
                      that as

                  Onely one T. M. the yonger, and would seeme to take no knowledge, that our Gracious Souereigne had to doe in the Apologie; now beeing exa sperate with this round canuasing of the Pope, and knowing that it wil be descried, for the stile and veine of more then an Ordinary man, hee forgets his dissembled aduersarie, and, like a persit Iesuite, retort's vpon Kings. For if T. M. (whom hee makes but an Inferior Minister of small account) were the true Apologer the Para. 1. 
                  recrimination had beene more fit, both in respect of these precedent instances of Popes, and that supposed Author, to haue made the comparison by Bishops and Ministers; that as not al Popes, so neither al which wear the habit, or

are inuested into holy orders amongst vs, are free from notorious vices, and scandalous to the world: but hee was pinch't, and the Egiptian Ape could not forbeare to breake out of the Maske, to shew himselfe in his right kinde.
               103 Secondly, what Insolencie is this, to compare Popes with Kings, Subiects with their Superiors; for euen Priests (as well as others) are subiect to their Souereignes, In Rom. 13. by Chrysostomes rule; the Popes Sublimity exempts him not; it is vsurped. Kings are enthroanized by Diuine ordinance, Popes aduanced by hu
                        •…
                     ane Arrogance, per me Reges regnant is the Text for Kings, spoken by the wisdome of God, and vtered in the book of God, by the mouth of the wisest King that euer breathed: the Text for Popes Priestly preeminencie none at all; for their Temporall principalitie, none other but UNAM SANCTAM, a text Bonifac. 8. in. extrauag. com. in the extrauagants from a Popes owne Decretall; and HEE one of the worst that euer sat in Rome, described commonly by the name of three Beasts.
               
               104 Thirdly, doth hee not heereby offer some disgrace to their Holy Father? For if Popes and Kings were to be compared together, in respect of their eminent places as the worlde findes them; yet, for integritie of life and freedome from Sinne, there should be a great disparison betweene them: for it were a shame to Popes, that Princes should be so free from vices, as THEY who professe themselues the abstracts of sanctitie, and are SO entituled; make themselues Christs Uicars: take vpon them to bee the ONELY Censores Morum through the whole world; and challenging the highest place, should giue the best example: whereas Kings haue many occasions which may allure them to sinne, especially hauing that Priuiledge in Scripture, whether exgratia or de facto; whether by exemption from God or feare in men, that NO Man may say vnto them Why doe you thus? And yet neuer could this Eccles. 8. 4. 
                  Censurer haue made a more vntimely and vnfitting retortion then at this instant: His Maiesties endowments and

                  cartage being such (as if their owne Historians deceiue vs not) few Popes will be found lesse tainted then his Maiesty will appeare in the stricktest search; for, as some of their owne Authors doe testifie, Popes are vsually praised for their GOODNES when they SVRPASSE not the WICKEDNES 
                  Guicciard. lib. 6. 
                  of other men; and some of them confesse, that a Pope hath beene trised away on the sudden, because it was suspected he would be OVER-GOOD. Fourthly, if that Genebrard. lib. 4. Chron. be true which hee saith (as it is indeede) that the wickednesse of Kings doth not preiudicate their princely right, either for power or dignity; what Doctrine then is that which teacheth, that, be Kings neuer so vertuous, if they acknow ledge not the Popes primacy, their right is NONE, either in hope if they expect, or holde if they possesse a Crowne: but their persons are liable to Deposing and killing; and their Subiects excitable to Insurrection and Rebellion? So that all Blasphemies and prophanations; all murthers and oppressions; all concubinacies, namelesse, innumerable; shamelesle, vnmatchable, shall not impeach or Subuert, a Kings Right; ONELY the deniall of the Popes authority, shall bee able to turne him out of his Throane and life.
               106 And now is it time that wee come to the
            
            
               Third part of this Paragraph.
               Which is spent in the examining of the Sentences & authorities of the anciēt Fathers cited by the Cardinall in his letter to the Arch-priest. Among which (as he closeth vp the other part with Alexander the 6. an eminent Pope for singular wickednes; so, be like because Pindarus would haue in the beginning of a Treatise 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   some glorious 
                  Pindar. 
                  personage to be fronted) he singles out Iulian to be the formost, an excellent Emperor for famous Blasphemie; vnto which impious Apostata, it pleased Bellarmine (the Ienocinating Pander to the Whore of Babylon) to compare our gratious Souereigne: hereby insinuating, that as Iulian to beguile

the Christians did insert the image of Diuels (which is Nazianzens word) or false Gods into his owne picture, that they, according to the Roman law, bowing to the Emperors image, might vnwittingly also adore those cunningly included Idols: so his Maiestie in the OATH of allegeance, hath mingled with some Articles concerning his own Souereignty, other clauses touching the Pope and his authority; to the end, that as the ancient Christians discerning that fraude in the pictures: so they also, which, discouering the Mixture in the OATH, forbeare to take it, might both be drawne within the compasse of TREASON.
               107 In which comparison, his Maiestie obseruing (as Homer in Thersites head, no countenance of a man, and Iliadae. the tongue of a Scrpent) both venemous malice in the personall, and a totall diuersitie in the reall resemblance, vnrippeth this Similtude; and by diuers particularities sheweth, that whereas all comparisons are (like Iaakob after his wrestling,)

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   & hath a general luxation in al the ioints and members, not agreeing in any one point for which it is brought, saue onely (which his Maiestie well obserued) that our Souereigne is a King, and Iulian was an Emperor: which thing alone reueales the malice in the Cardinals choise of that Example. For if he had meant to touch the OATH, onely for the mixture, and left the persons alone; euen in that very place of Nazian▪
                   whence he borrowed that resemblance, hee might haue fitted his purpose better, in comparing the blending and tempering of those MIXT articles, vnto the compounding of

                   wholsome meats and rank poison together Nazianz.

                     . in Iulan. (for so that great Diuine fitly compares that action of Iulan:) but heereby hee would notifie, that it is not the Oath, but the King, which is the eye-sore of the Romish
                  
                  Clergy; his glory prouokes their Enuy; his Religion their malice.
               
               108 And now to this, what saith the learned Censurer? His answer is an est long, but not an inch to the purpose. Namely, 
                     that the Apologer, beeing sore pressed with this resemblance, is forced into a wearying discourse, to shew the diuersities in that comparison, which must needes bee LOATHSOME to euery man of meane iudgement, who knoweth that a Similitude must bee defectiue in all things but in THAT POINT wherein the comparison is made; or else many Parables vttered by our Sauiour Christ (wherof hee cites many) might seeme very strange and impertinent:
                    and so hee goes on in a long flagging discourse, whereout the offalls of scorning tearmes beeing taken, to bee resumed by himselfe (as the eiection which hee hath once voided, with Solomons loathsome Creature) all comes Pro. 26. 11. to this one profound conclusion, that a Similitude must only hold in that point wherein it is compared. Of which, if any man but meanely learned had had the handling hee would haue reduced it all briefely to that rule of Isidor, 
                  Pelusiot. epist. 175. that in Parables we must not take 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   nor sit matter to euery circumstance thereof, for that were to wring the Scripture by wresting it too violently, and to wrong Diuinity by forcing in many a fancy (which is Gregories speech, alluding to the place of Solomon, of wr

                     ging the Nose till the blood come); because if a comparison Pro. 30. 33. should hold in ALL, it were an identity not a resemblance.
               
               109 For which cause, Diuines haue reduced all Parables to foure heads, either 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   wherein the nature only of the thing doth make the comparison; as in the parable of the Seede sowne, the variety of encrease by the worde preached, is expressed by the multiplying Mat. 13. 19. or failing of the graine, according to the seuerall soiles where it alights; or 2. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   wherin the disposition or affection only is resembled; as when our Lord compares

himselfe to children piping and whistling, to expresse the milde & comfortable meanes which he vsed for the winning Matth. 1

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   wherein a passion or perturbation is onely assimilated, as the second comming of Christ is resembled to a theeues burghlary, and a womans

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   wherein the action onely is to be regarded for cō

To which last, this resēblance that the Cardinall hath brought, is to be referred; produced by him for no other purpose (as is pretended) but only for the Mixture of diuersities (as there in the Banner, so in the Oath with vs:) and therein hath hee m
                     •…
                  nifested more malice then iudgement. For euen in that very point, his Similitude (as taken with the Crampe) halts downe-right: because in the Imperiall pictures, though there were differēt features, yet they all concurred to one end, and for the same intent, that is for Adoration, though to the one more openly, to the other more couertly: for so saith Nazian. in this action of Iulian, there was 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   
                  AMIXT ADORATION 
                  Ubi supra. 
                  communicated both, with the Emperor, and with the Idols also; In the OATH 'tis cleane contrary, which is so farre from beeing a MIXTVRE of Allegeance, that it separates all acknowledgement of any temporall right, or right of any temporall acknowledgement from Pope, or anie other else; but to his Maiesty alone within his Realmes. And if this be a Mixture, it is such as Philosophy wil not acknowledge, [mistio secernens] & no other but that which King Salomon speakes of, REMOOVE the wicked from 
                  Pro. 25. 5. 
                  the King; and his Throane shall bee established in iudgement; which is the summe of that part of the Oath that is thus saide to be tempered, so, to abiure and abandon that wicked doctrine,
                  
                  and that vsurped authoritie of the Papall claime for Deposing of Kings: and so Princes Throanes will be established, they shall rule in peace, and liue in safety. And thats no other Mixture then fire makes in the Finers fornace, dispergens heterogenea, to cleere the drosse from the Gold, saith Ibid. the wise King.
               110. Had the Oath beene so cunningly framed, that with the recognition of his Maiesties absolute & vnmatchable right, there were secretly couched a couert acknowledgement of some other person; whereby, in swearing allegeance to his Maiestie, he that takes the Oath, should at vnawares sweare also to the support of some other exoticall authority; then had the resemblance beene very pat, and fitly applied, euen in the very point: but seeing those modifications (as the Cardinall cals them) be all EXCLVDING ones, the Oath may be called any thing rather then a mixture; or if it be so, it is onely because the Pope is eftsoones named in some clauses where his Maiestie is inserted, and so indeed the resemblance in that circumstance may hold of the Imperiall Picture and Image of Diuels. But though the King and Pope be named in One OATH (as Christ and Belial in One TEXT by the Apostole) yet is it not for 2. Cor. 6 15. 
                  ioynt Adoration (as in the banner) but for Recognition of the One, and Abiuration of the other. Whereupon, his Maiestie, to shew the virulent malice and vnlogicall argumentation of the Cardinall, by fetching in this sinister Comparison, aduisedly expresseth, how it faileth not only in the very apodosis and assimilatum for which it is brought, but that in EVERY circumstance besides, thereis a manifold difformitie and disparison: a labour as it now appeares, by way of preuention necessarie; for Tortus; according to his name, plaies the wire-drawer, and will needs stretch the resemblance, into an identity, forcing it to agree in euery point.
               111. And yet THIS the NASTY Censurer, taking the sauour by his owne breath, cals a loathsom labour of

his Maiestie (but addes withall, saying more truly then he was aware of, it was LOATH SOME to men of MEANE iudgement,
                    he knew that by himselfe) but indeuours not to confute it: onely with certaine inkhorne tearmes (of Euacuating, and Shifting, and Tristing, &c.) and a few Postilar notes of Scripture-parables (so dully and iniudiciously laid out, that a man of any learning would LOATH to read them) at last hee pitcheth vpon this stale and triuiall conclusion, that a Sim

                     litude requireth not parity in all points; which his Maiestie denied not, yea, he said as much before him; and thereupon displaieth the absurdity of this resemblance, which varieth (as the Logitians speake) in ratione instituti, in that very poy
                        •…
                     t to which the Cardinall would malitiously apply it; and hath no conformity either with the manner, or with the intendment of the Mixtures (so to call them.) For the manner THERE, was couert, and purposely dissembled; HEERE, open, and aduisedly reuealed: the intent THERE, was a colourable worshipping of BOTH the features; the intendment in the OATH, a diametrall renouncing ONE of the parties. And grant there were a MIXTVRE in both; yet THERE it was reall, for a mutuall adoration; HEERE, but verball (at most) for a reall separation.
               
               112. The second authority which the Cardinall allegeth to rectifie the Arch-priests iudgement in the nature of the Oath, is an Apocryphal of Eleazer, that as he would neither eate, nor feigne to eate Swines flesh, lest by his simulation 
                  2. Maccab. 6. 18. 
                  hee might make others to preuaricate; so should not the Arch-Priest take the OATH, vpon the like reason of giuing offense. Which his Maiesty answering, she weth, not only that the ground of Refusal is different, because THAT eating was expresly for bidden in the Law of God, THIS Swearing warranted by Scripture, & commanded by the Magistrate: but also retorteth it vpon the Cardinall, that if a man should chuse to die rather then breake a Ceremoniall Law, or feign the breach therof for feare of seducing

others; much rather should a man hazard his life, then either Refuse an OATH (which the Lawe of Nature, God, and Man, doe iustifie and inioine) or pretend the Refusing of it to the scandall of a Realme, and the iust offence of his Souereigne. This being a knot—Vindice dignus, 
                  Horace. which the Epistler cannot tell hastily how to vnloose; therefore as the Orator notes of Poets in their Tragedies, 
                  Tulli. de nat. deorum. that being driuen to an exigent, they will haue Deum ex improuiso, some God in an Engine, which must giue them a list, and helpe them out cleanly: so this Censurer, whensoeuer he is at a stand (wanting another answer) presently windes in his old common-place of Conscience and Catholike Religion;  for thus hee speaketh, 
                     That if a man in his OWNE Conscience thinke the OATH to be against the CATHOLIKE Faith he ought to be as shie of it, as Eleazar was of eating Swines flesh.
                  
               
               113 But what if there be a false assumption, or an vntrue application by the Conscience? then is it erroneous, not binding: as put case the conscience either assume that to bee sound and Catholike, which is false & vnchristian doctrine; or apply that which is true & vnchallengeable, to a wrong end: then is it not Conscience but Error; and this is their very case which refuse the Oath. For first, they assume the Popes power of deposing Princes to be Catholike Doctrine, which hath no ground for it in warrantable Diuinitie: Secondly, they auoide a Recognition of meere Temporall Allegeance, as applying it to be a deniall of a Spirituall Supremacie. A patterne of both these errors, in another case, may be seene in S. Peter himselfe; first, when he forbore Gal. 2. 12. to cate with the Gentiles, lest he should giue occasion of offence to the Iewes, assuming THAT his abstinence for auoiding scandall, to be warranted by Diuinitie, which S. Paul not withstanding, to his face, tolde him was not the right course; there was his false assumption: the other was Matt. 16. 21. his vndue applying of our Sauiours prediction touching his trouble and death; which S. Peter referring to a Temporall
                  
pressure, not a Spirituall redemption, was therefore perswaded in his Conscience, that he ought to diswade our Sauiour from it, by vsing meanes to preuent it; but therupon he procured to himselfe the name of an Errant opposite to be called Satan. Therefore, as it hath beene often said, (for the Epistler his frequent Palinodie causeth irksome reiterations) either make the doctrine sound, that the Conscience directed by it may not erre; or else if that be corrupt, this will be Leprous.
               
               114 And it were well, when such as Hee plead their Conscience, they would withall define what it is in them, seeing, that (as the Elephant vseth her probos
                        •…
                     is or trunke) it is extended or contracted (as it seems) at the Popes pleasure. For in the yeare 1580. Campian inlargeth it, assuring the Catholiks, that not withstanding the Pope had excommunicated Queene Elizabeth, yet with a safe conscience they might obey Her in all Temporall Causes. About eight yeares after (vpon the Inuasion) Allen doth streighten it; though THAT Holy Father, saith hee, did then permit obedience in some cases to the Queene, yet THIS Holy Father dischargeth all men from it; and therefore with a safe conscience they may not obey her in ANYTHING. In such diuersitie of Science, how can there bee a setled perswasion of Conscience? And this puts the maine difference betwixt Eleazars abstinence, and their refusall; that he had, for the warrant of his Conscience, Legem scriptam, an expresse Commandement from the Law of God, and therfore did forbeare: they, hauing none other but either a fansied conceit of their own, or a Tyrannicall Iniunction from an intruded Vsurper, pretend conscience for refusing that which the Law of God alloweth. For proofe whereof, his Maiesty instanceth the Oath inioined by K. Saul to his Armie; the punishment whereof. God himselfe tooke in to 1. Sam. 14. 24 his owne handes, for the breach thereof. But that example,—reddidit Harpocratem, hath put the Censurer to silence.
               
                  
115 And so he passeth to the third authority alledged by the Cardinall, and recorded by Theodoret, concerning S. Basil; who refused to yeelde his consent in the points of Eccles. hist. lib. 4. ca. 17. lat. 19. Graece.

                   request, made vnto him in the Emperors name for that purpose; and gaue his reason for it, that rather all kinde of Torment should be endured, then one syllable of GODS WORD should bee corrupted. In his Maiesties answer thereunto, the Epistler o
                     •…
                   serueth (as he cals them) three Shifts (for lightly an Impostor will speake in the phrase of his owne occupation:) the first whereof (where his Maiestie taxeth Bellarmine for one of his old and vsuall trickes, in cutting off and leauing out that peece of the sentence which should make most against himselfe, and for the requisition to the Oath) he calles, a 
                     Calumniation in two respects; first, because the sentence left out doth nothing auaile the Apologer, but sits the Cardinals purpose directly.
                   How prooues he that? Nay, Dixit & obmutuit, yee must take his word for an Oracle; for, proofe he hath none. Examine it notwithstanding.
               116 The words of S. Basil (added by Theodoret, omitted by the Cardinall, called for by his Maiestie) are; that he much regarded the Emperours friendship, SO FARRE FOORTH as it was ioined with PIETIE: but if THIS be wanting, the OTHER is dangerous: which words doe thus make for the Apologer; that seeing the Oath consorts in all points with Pietie, both towards God and the King, the Arch-priest (by that speech of S. Basil) shold embrace his Souereignes loue by taking the OATH, and submitting himselfe vnto that which true godlinesse doth warrant: But that being wanting in the Emperors request to that Reuerend Prelate, it caused S. Basil to make small account of his Deputies message. If the Cardinall had soundly proued the same defect to bee in the Oath, the example had beene proper: but the contrarie being manifest, hee both reueales a falsitie, by coupling a conclusion which makes against him; and an indiscretion also, by citing an example

that auailes nothing to his purpose.
               117 And this the Censurer cals the first shift, in answer to this ANCIENT, or rather ANTICK; for so, both in his gibing veine he prophanely tearmes that grane and holy Bishop, and with his ignorant boldnes scoffs at his Maiestie for calling the Fathers ANCIENTS, which is (in truth) their most proper tearme. For first, to denominate persons of eminent qual
                        •…
                     e by the concrete, is vsuall in euery language. The Hebrewes do stile men, notable for valour and courage, in the adiectiue alone; for Benaiah is said to haue his name among the three STRONG: so the Graecians doe entitle men singular for Sanctitie aboue others, 2. Sam. 23. 22. by the name of Holy or Saints: and so, men for yeeres multiplied, or by authority aduanced, the Latines 
                  Rom. 1. 7. doe call them Seniors, Elders, or ANCIENTS of the 
                  Numb. 11. 16. vulgar. 
                  people. Secondly the title of FATHER is alwaies vnderstood relatiuely to the sonnes which hee hath; and so in spiritual sense it cannot be proper to those great writers alone. For, if it be giuen in respect of begetting men to Christ by preaching the Gospel, so, both the Apostle challengeth 1. Cor. 4. 15. it to himself, and euery Preacher of the word, or Rector of a Congregation, deserueth that name: if in regard of Ordination, so is it proper to Bishops onely, in the opinion of Epiphanius and S. Augustine; and then all those Holy Writers cannot appropriate that name of Father vnto themselues Aug. in Psal. 45. because Tertullian, Origen, and Clemens Alexandrinus, three of the neerest (almost) vnto Christs time, that are extant, and S. Hierome, one of the foure principall in account, were not Bishops but Priests, and Iustin Martyr a Philosopher only entitled: The word ANCIENT therefore, whether we respect their authority in the Chruch, or their antiquity of time, is the more sutable: albeit for the most part, in Scripture, they signifie the same thing. For the Text, whereby they vse to arrest vs, and force vs to make those Fathers Iudges in our Controuersies, combines them together. Aske thy FATHER, saith Moses, 
                  Deut. 32. 7.
                  
                  and hee will tell thee; thine ANCIENTS, and they will shew thee: So S. Paul, Rebuke not an ANCIENT or Elder, but exhort him as a FATHER: And the mighty God 1. Tim. 5. 1. whom S. Iames calleth the FATHER of lights, the Prophet Daniel intitles him the ANCIENT of daies. Yet Iac. 1. 17. Dan. 7. 9. such is the in-bred gibing nature of this Ismaell, that hee cannot forbeare his

                  ering vaine, though to the disgrace of the holiest Writers; but, because his Maiestie cals them ANCIENTS, he will stout them into ANTICKS.
               
               118. Indeed, were they (whom his Maiesty mentioneth) such ANCIENTS as those foisted vpon vs by the Romish Church, such as Abdias and Amphilochius (cited Hardi. contr. Iewell. for the antiquitie of their Masse) the one of them (as they say) being of mans yeeres in Christs time, in his Story then written, mentioning Egesippus who liued an hundred and sixty yeeres, after him: the other writing the Story of Beckets life seuen hundred yeares before the sullen Saint was borne: These, with their Clement and Dyonysius, and those of that frie, he might haue called ANTICKS, couering yoong faces vnder old deformed visards, and presenting nothing worthy view but moppish toies, in ridiculous fables. But let him goe; for what credit can a man winne with incountring such a mate? sithence he that reproues a

                  Scorner, gets himselfe a blot, saith King Solomon.
               
               119. To the point it selfe. Is his Maiesties pressing challenge of the Cardinall, for slicing of that peece of the sentence which might make against him, 
                     a SHIFT? Then haue all the Fathers turn'd off the Diuell with a shift for that is it of which they challenge Satan in his Temptation of our Sauior, that vnder pretext of a Scripture Text he would haue our Lorde to breake his necke: which had not the Diuell mangled, by leauing out the wordes that would haue choak't him, the very same Text had cōsuted him, euen for that very motion: for thus hee cites it to Christ, Hee shall keepe thee, that thou shalt not hurt thy foote,

                  Lieuetenant, which this profound Iesuite cunningly translated Sacred Learning, lest Saint Basil should bee thought to attribute ouer much authority to the Scripture, and thereby should imply vnwritten Traditions: and to make this the more probable, very honestly he forceth in a Parenthesis [of the Church] vpon the Text, and translates

                  Diuine Doctrines, as if that holy father had vnderstood Decrees or Canons Ecclesiasticall concluded by the Church in some Synode.
               124 Which giues occasion to the second question, that wil appose a better Scholler then this chattering Censurer, where it was euer read that the Church constitutions or opinions, resolued by Councels or Fathers (not hauing their warrant from the expresse word) were called diuina dogmata: Bellarmine, in his diuision of Traditions, implieth De verbo non scripto. lib. 4. ca. 2. the contrarie: for sorting them into three kindes, Diuine, Apostolicall and Ecclesiasticall, THEM onely hee saith to be Diuine, which, though they bee not written, Christ himselfe with his OWNE mouth deliuered vnto his Apostles. But had he beene silent, ONE of more antiquity and Credit then he is, hath long since interpreted Saint Basils

So that his Maiestie translating it with a reference to that former part, did it not eyther with preiudice to any partie, or superficially through neglect, but vpon good warrant; for they that betray the Doctrine which God hath deliuered, (that is, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ) they do also betray the booke of God it selfe wherein it is deliuered.
               125 And yet lest it might bee thought that his Maiestie

               126 But of this challenge hee giues a reason that it could not bee meant of Gods Doctrine in the SCRIPTVRE, because the controuersies then debated, were concerning HOMOVSION and HYPOSTASIS, and other such names SVBSTANCE, PERSON, TRINITY, &c. which being not found expresly in Scripture, but determined by the Church, Saint Basil called DIVINA DOGMATA. Now who would not admire Father Parsons his dexteritie in answering, but special ly his profound skill in Diuinitie? Are Dogmata, the Positions and opinions concerning the Coessence, substance, person, &c. conclusions onely of the Church, and not Bible Doctrine? then was S. Ambrose to blame to triumph ouer the Arrian with such a daring question, how is it thou saist that homousion is not to bee found in Scripturis diuinis (that is Basils Ambrose de side contr. Arrian. Cap. 5. 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ) in the HOLY SCRIPTVRES, being that thou seest and maiest know, the UNITIE of substance to bee ratified by the authority both of PROPHETS and EVANGELISTS? whereof Saint Ambrose had cited many in the Chapter before; and the most of them Theodoret our Author also hath couched together in his first Eccles. hist. lib. 1. cap. 8. Booke. Then was Saint August: likewise too ventrous in

appealing for homousion, both from the Councell of Nice which confirmed it, & that of Ariminum which confuted it, vnto the SACRED SCRIPTVRES as the most August. lib. 3. contr. Max.

But Epiphanius more bold then they all, who saith that the Coessence of the Father and the Sonne, is in the Law, in the Apostles, and the Prophets,

                  conteined. And so might we cite Tertullian, Athanasius, Basil, Hilary, and many other, all earnest in the point, that the Coessence, as it is DOGMA, a Diuinity Position, is Scripture Doctrine.
               
               127 Yea, but the WORD it selfe is not there, what's that to Saint Basil? that's 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   a curiositie of OPINIONS, not of Diuinity TEARMES & WORDS; neither the controuersie of the Christians with those Arrians was for the word so much, as for the Substance & Doctrine 
                  Euseb. hist. li. 1. cap. 12. and yet it appeares by Theodoret (reciting the Epistle of Eusebius concerning the Nicen Creed, wherin that word is inserted) that those Fathers accounted euen the WORD it self, to be a Scripture tearm; for in the Anathema annexed by that Councel vnto the conclusion of that Creed, it is enioined vpon paine therof, that none should vse any tearme or WORD not written in the Scripture. And that is it of which S. Basil himself challengeth Eunomius for inforcing 
                  Contr. Eunom. lib. 2. WORDS and tearmes not found in any place of holy Writ; which, within a line or two after, he calleth

Which though the Iesuite at the first, calls, a weake argument; yet hee is pleased afterward to trie how hee can make a conformity betweene it and the Oathe; which hee doth, by a compatatiue supposing; and that two folde: first of the persons, both of the Emperors Deputy, and our Iudges, that, If Modestus the Deputy, had beene asked, infauour of what Religion hee made the demand to Saint Basil, hee would haue answered, the ORTHODOX: as the Iudges, of England doe now, that require the Oath.

Basil was euidently apparant: for the opinions then controuerted, hee tearmed them but quillets: as Gallio an Other Deputy, but a question of words and names: either might stand as the Act. 1

                  Emperor thought good: and for the profession, he tolde Saint Basil, it was but yeelding for the time, making faire

weather for the present: and the most pressing motiue hee vsed, was but the promise of the Emperers friendship: for THAT (you may bee sure) the Deputie thought to be a mans Summum bonum, and to be preferred before all the Coessences or hypostases, or Trinity or Deity, or whatsoeuer. Which made that holy Father to tel him that his arguments were toies for Children. As for our Iudges; which of them amongst vs, in tendring the Oath, doth offer it as a matter of Faith or Doctrine; tending one way or other? saue that as the allegiance of a Subiect, and the assurance of the Kings safety is a point of Religion.
               
               130 His other personall supposall is of the fore-named Emperor, and a Protestant prince, 
                  
                     that if any man should hauethen called Valens, Arrian, it had beene no lesse offensiue, then now to call King Iames (that's his meaning) a Caluinist or Lutheran.
                   And whats this to the purpose? But that his gall ouer-flowes, and he must void it by his pen in his icteritious Pamphlet: His Maiesty no further holdeth with Luther or Caluin, then Saint Paul his Sicut giues him leaue; that is, so farre foorth as they hold with Christ: and were 1. Cor. II. I. not the Romish both Princes and Priests enthralled to the Popes Dictats,—Iurare in verba magistri, to take his word Horace. for Gospell, more then King Iames is to Caluin or Luther, factions in Religion had long since vanished, & Christianity had beene more firmely established, and floutished more generally. In the meane time, to this scorning Flur, his maiestie answers with the same modesty, truth and learning, that Saint Augustine did such a petulant Companion (as Contr. lit. Petil. lib. 2. Cap. 10. 12. this Iesuite) by whome he was charged to bee a Manichee It is Petilian, saith he, who iudging of an other mans conscience doth so intitle mee, but I deny my selfe to bee, which know myselfe, and speake out of mine owne conscience; homosum de area Christi, I am a man of Christs floore; if I be naught, I am the Chaffe; if I be good, I am the graine: buius autem Area ventilabrum non est lingua Petiliani, yet is it not the peeuish or lauish tongue of Father Parsons, that must Ventilate the

Corne of this Floore, to trie whether I bee chasse

                  Wheate.
               
               131 His second conformitie therefore is of the matter that the differences betwixt Arrians and Catholikes in Saint Basils time, are the same which are betweene Protestants and Papists at this day.
                    In the Chapter where this Story in hand is recorded, Theodoret makes mention of Lib. 4. cap. 17. the Emperors Cooke (whose name was Demosthenes) how rudely he railed vpon Saint Basil when he was cōferring with Valens the Emperor; and all the answere which that Reuerend Father gaue him, was a smile, with this touch, now I see an VNLEARNED Demosthenes: and who will not smile and say, that hee now heares not an vnlearned only, but a shameles Iesuite, making this comparison? For it is knowne that Arrianisme rased the very foundation of our Faith in Christ Iesus; wheras there is no principle of diuinity, nor Article of Creed, but the Protest ints (so called) doe professe it more sincerely, and maintaine it more firmely, then the Church of Rome hath done for these thousand yeares.
               132 But grant all this that hath beene saide by him were true (as nothing can bee more false) yet what is it to the Oath, or to the Cardinalls intendment; or for the Arch-priests refufal, either as Bellarmine applies the Storie, or as the Censurer abbets it? For this is Bellarmines argument (if hee ment it to the purpose in hand); Sant Basill denyed his yeelding to Arrianisme at the Emperors command lest there by hee should deny the God-
                        •…
                     ead of his Lord and Christ: therefore Blackwell ought to forbeare the taking of an Oath, wherein hee should onely recognize his Faith and Fealtie to his hedge King and Soueraigne. The Epistlers is this: Arrianisme and Caluianisme are both alike opposite to Catholike truth, therefore Papists may not take the Oath of Temporall Allegeance to their lawfull King. For let it bee duely weighed (bee the Circumstances neuer so many) this is the summe and substance of their applying

and supporting that alleaged authoritie, if they speake to the point. And did not then the Saduces make as necessarie a Consequence vpon the Iudiciall Law? Seuen brethren successiuely married one woman, as Moses willed; & they 
                  Matt. 22 25. 
                  all deceasing she at last died, therefore there can be no resurrection to another world, lest the marriage there should proue litigious?
               
               133. But by this time now, the Censurer hath surfeited of his paines, and is glad (as it seemes by him) that hee is come to the REMAINDER,as he cals it, Num. 68 So that all the the Sections following, are but transitions of S. Peter and Marcellinus, & Gregory and Leo, &c. Examples produced by the Cardinall, and refelled by his Maiesty with singular d

                     xterity, learning and zeale. And yet this (though but a Remainder) the Epistler, as being too heauy for his weake skill, transmits to the Cardinall: wherein hee disfereth from that railing Cooke before mentioned; Theodor vbi supra. for S. Basil was inforced to cut him off, telling him that his skill was best in the Kitchin when he was seasoning broath, his Adders eares were not for Misteries of Diuinitie. But Fa. Parsons (though the Priests describe him to be a most hot and chollericke fellow) hath, you see, this grace (or Art at least) while these points are in hand to dismisse himselfe, and slip the collar iust as Gallio did in the Acts, and in his Act. 8. 15. very words, Siiniquum aliquid aut facinus pessimum, ō Iudaei recte vos sustinerem: If there be matter of any notable Trechery, Villanie, Conspiracy, you shall finde mee ready to support you, Cardinall Bellarmine: but if they be questions of Gods Law touching points of Diuinity, matter of ancient Story, or reading in Fathers, Uos Ipsi videritis, Iudex ego horum esse nolo: Looke to it your selfe Sir, I will bee no Iudge in THESE matters. If any matter of scorning or reuiling, or fresh intelligence of things neuer acted nor thought of; then turne HIM loose. To iustifie this for a truth. the Reader shall not skip a Section; for, howsoeuer he transmits the reply, vpon his Maiesties answer to those authorities, vnto the Cardinall, for the substance there of;
yet he hath alight vpon a SCOFFE therein (as he tearmes it) and there he staies a while.
               134. If it be a Scoffe, t'is that which they call edentata

A comparison full of Vrbanity and truth: ciuilly taxing, not the Popes arrogancie so much as his Pollicie, that could winde himselfe vp into an vniuersall praeeminence by the Proxie of S. Peters pretended assumption. But is not this facete Resemblance retorted (indeed) with a bitter scorne by the Epistler, when he saith, 
                     that his Maiesty borrowed both that allusion and those subsequent Collections out of Leo, from M. Reynolds (as if all his Maiesties learning were at the second hand) and M. Reynolds from M. Iewell?
                   (sure hee was as lawfull a Bishop, as M. Bellarmine is a Cardinall, and deserues the Title as well;) which is not a Scoffe onely, but a plaine Slander.
               
               135. First, for his Maiestie: Hee that heares his ordinary Discourses at euery meale, vpon euery occasion, in any argument of any kind of Learning, shall find (according to the ancient Greek Prouerbe) that he is not Achil

Secondly, for D. Reynolds, his Bookes diuulged are few; but compare them that are, quantitie for quantitie, with Bellarmines large bulke of Controuersies (let the collation bee vnpartiall) the Cardinal will be found to come as short of him, for variety of all kinde of Learning, admirable memorie,

                  Aristotle once applied it out of Homer, Polydamas mihi pris mum? Doth Fa. Parsons tax any for borrowing, who, not Aristot. Eth. only by the auerment of the Priests, but by the true tracing of his Pamphlets, is discouered for a more vaine crowling, bragging it with his borrowed plumes, then that Iacke Daw, which Aesop describes, and Horace applies in the like case? For if euery Creditor should arrest him for that he hath borrowed in the worldes view (besides his priuie debts, he would be forc't for shame to say, as the Leno did in the Comaedie for his stolne Damosels (when hee was attached, and could conceale them no longer) Miratus fui

                     e the Pope from being Antichrist, is wholly taken out of Bellarmines Bookes. In his triple Conuersions, all his Martyrs and Saints fetch't out of Surius and Barouius, with the Romane Legend. In this Censure of the Apologie, those foule imputations laid vpon Lady Elizabeth, THAT QVEENE of pretious memory, all borrowed from Saunders, Reynolds, and Gifford, saue some railing tearmes wrought out of his owne braine, as the Spiders web out of her own substance. But whatsoeuer concerneth the nature of the Oath, or title of Supremacie, Allens Apologie is his chiefe Oracle; and that so palpably, that (as he once said) Hem alterum hunc ex hoc natum dicas: 
                  Terent. Eunuc. But of all other, his Resolution (which is the only praiseworthy worke that euer he did) if from thence, Gasper Loartes 
                  Quodli. pa. 71. 173. should take what is his, a few scraps would remaine of Parsons owne, if the Priests say true. Yea Bellarmine himselfe, that Great Apollo for Controuersies (it will bee iustified) hath no answer to any Argument, nor definition nor diuision of any wit or weight, which he hath not borrowed

from Popish Writers, that haue handled the same questions before him. But it is all-day seene, that there is none so ready to take a debtor by the throat, for borrowing a pety summe of foure Nobles then he, who himselfe was in arrerages aboue ten thousand Talents. 
                  Matth. 18. 28.
               
               136 And what is that which is thus borrowed by M. Reynolds? Certaine hyperbolicall bumbasted phrases, wherewith Leo sets out S. Peters authority; especially that blaspemous speech of his, that our Lord did take S. Peter into the Fellowship of the INDIVISIBLE VNITIE; such an impious and prophanely proude assertion, as a Christians heart would tremble to imagine it, his hand ab horre to write it. And this (saith the Censurer) hath the Apologer taken from M. Reynolds, and hee from M. Iewell
                    And will Fa. Parsons auouch this vpon his small credit? Such Challengers should direct the Reader to the places, else they will be thought forgeries; and make truer quotations then the Epistler doth heere, who, for that speech of Leo, sends vs in the margin to an Epistle of his ad Episcopum Uiennensem, there being no such in all his Booke, but one intituled ad Episcopos per Uiennensem Prouinciam constitutos: which, were it his owne or the Printers error, since he will be such a curious Lynceus in other mens marginall slips, it is good to let him see his own escapes, yet not as HE doth with contumelious insulting. But in what Booke of Bishop Iewels is it; or where hath Harding answered it? The truth is, that this may be a double vntruth, both for the challenge and the answer, seeing he quotes no place. For Bishop Iewell in one Booke neither names Leo therein, nor B. Iewell, Re ply, Artic. 4. Diuis. 32. reads the words so as Leo hath them: but the wordes by him there cited, are, that God tooke S. Peter in Consortium indiuiduae TRINITATIS, into the Consort and Fellowship of the indiuisible TRINITIE; and for the Authour of the speech, he quotes Boniface the 8. out of the Sext or Extr. de elect. & elect. potest. paragr. Fundament. 
                  Decretals. How then could Harding answere him for Leo, when in that case he mentioneth him not? but suppose he

hath answered it, what followes thereof? 
                     Being once answered (quoth hee) they neede not repeat it so often againe:

                     sts had taken out that Lesson, the world had been eased of many Bookes, and Bellarmine might haue Epitomized his three Tomes.)
               
               137 Indeed such swelling words of Vanity (or rather of Blasphemie) were better buried in silence, then reuiued in print, if the Pope would leaue arrogating to himselfe Uide Martam & Benedict

                  cence from Reply; for silence in that kinde, doth not only betray the truth, but also establisheth a falshood, by an implied consent.
               138 Heare we then that answer, either made by Harding, or cogg'd by Parsons:
                   
                      The Vnitie that Leo speakes of is of NAME, not of ESSENCE. First then, both Leo and Boniface were to blame, who in the very same place where those words are, say, that Christ made S. Peter the chiefe, that from him (as from the head) hee might powre 
                  Vbi supra. 
                  his gifts into the whole body of his Church: and presently subnects the reason thereof, for that hee had taken S. Peter into the Consort of the indiuisible Unitie. This is another manner of assumption into Unity then Names wil affoord. But the Glosse is much more to blame, to point vs, for the interpretation of the word Vnity, to that Chapter of the Decrees, In Christo Pater; but that thereby they would haue vs know, the Unity whereunto Christ tooke S. Peter, to be Gloss. ibid. & de Consecr. dist. 2. in Christo. Aluar. Pelap. de planct. Eccles. lib. 1. cap. 37. the same of the Sonne with the Father. And doe not their owne Canonists plainely say, that Papa participat vtramque naturam cum Christo? Secondly, what learning will iustifie that phrase of speech [an Vnity of names?] One name may be communicated between two, or among moe, and many names of diuers appellations may be vnited in one Catalogue; or, after the custome of the old Romanes, and some Nations, in one mans title: but that the same name,

imparted to seuerall persons, should be called an Unity, le

Or what Diuinitie will warrant, that Indiuidua Vnitas was euer attributed to any but to the holy Trinity, in the eternal & vnseparable essence vnited? Thirdly, whereas he saith, that Hardings answere is according to Leo his sense and drift, it is an errant falshood: for his word assumptum signifying the

Peter into that fellowship, id quod ipse ERAT voluit nominari, his pleasure was to call him by the name of that which himselfe was. Fourthly, the word Rocke is none of the names of our Sauiour, but Symbolically onely; and so is the name of light: which title notwithstanding Matth. 5. 14. he imparted to al his Apostles, which (by this rule) might inuest them with as high an interest in the Indiuisible Vnity as S. Peter had; and Moses much more, vnto whom the Almighty gaue his owne name, telling him that he should be Elohim, God vnto Pharao; another manner of Vnity for Exod. 7. 1. a name, then the Metaphor of a Rocke.
               
               139 In briefe, let Leo expound himselfe, as elsewhere he doth, when hee saith, that our Lord (of his fauour and grace) vouchsafed to S. Peter Consortium potentiaesuae, the great and wonderfull consort and fellowship of his owne

                  power; among the rest, that there should be no Principality on earth, but it should bee giuen by S. Peter. And a little after, making Christ speake to S. Peter of the Prerogatiue which was granted him, he declares (withall) the extent thereof, Vt quae mihi potestate sunt propria, because those things

                  which are proper to my 'POWER, are also participated in Common betweene US two. And is not this Vnity of more inward consort then Names can worke? which (to turne the Censurers words vpon himselfe) if Harding or Parsons would haue equally considered, neither would the one haue answered it so sleightly & vn-diuine-like, neither the other be offended to heare it oft repeated, that euen for

the credit of their eloquently arrogant Pope, it might haue light vpon a sounder Apology, or Interpretation at least. But speake insooth (honest Censurer) is Vnity of NAME Hardings owne distinction in answere to Bishop Iewell? Himselfe denieth it▪
                   for M. Harding saith, that Har. fol. 174. D. Iewell. def. of Apol. part. 2. fol. 121. Addition. 
                  Leo meant thereby an Unity in Quality, an Unity in Grace, an Unity that is proper to Christ himselfe; and mentioneth no Unity of NAME: for though hee were a corrupt Doctor, yet was he a better Diuine then to speake so absurdly, as Parsons would heere make him.
               140 After this, like another Lysander, hauing stripp't himselfe of his Lions skinne, and spoken for Leo, what hee can, and as you heare; now he presents himselfe in his Foxes Case, and takes Bellarmines person vpon him (for of Saunders, it seemes he is ashamed) in which habit, hee hath cunningly crept thorow seuen leaues at once of the Apology, from page 95. to 110. euen to that place where his Maiesty doth charge the Cardinall (after an excellent comparison of Contrarietyes betweene the Scriptures and Bellarmines writings) that God and Belial, light and darkenesse, Heauen and Hell, are not more contrary, then the said Bellarmines estimation of Kings, is to Gods. Which after this Censurer hath imboss't with a name according to his Custome (calling it A PASSIONATE CONCLVSION) he makes a long relation of 
                     the Reuerend opinion that Bellarmine hath, and of the high Supremacie which he allots to Kings, which wee may see (he saith) in the Cardinals Booke, De Laicis
                    (for hee is excellent to lengthen a discourse, when t'is prepared to his hand, as Iacob 
                  Gen. 27. was to commend his cogg'd venison when Rebecka had prouided it.)
               141. But hauing read that Booke (to which he referres vs) what shall wee fin de there? First, 
                     that the Cardinall doth there respect Kings, as much as any other, perhaps, hath euer done bef

                        s, &c.
                   In both which, Fa. Rainard shewe himselfe what he is, for lest he should be taken in the first for ouer-lashing (because it will appeare that Bellarmine, in that theme, comes short of many Bookes both of God and Men, extant before his) he puts in [PERHAPS] and then what hath the Cardinall done equal with other men? For THAT Word must excuse him, if either his good respect of kings come short of other Authors, or his base account of thē exceed any other; that, perhaps, he respected them as well as they did, and, perhaps, not. Now sure, M Bellarmine, Quicquid rectè curatum velis huic mandes, You haue alight vpon a worthy Patron, and his Maiesty vpon Terent. a learned Antapologer. And euen so he deales in the secōd. For the Cardinal maintaines Kings (saith he) against Anabap tists and Atheists;

 This is (indeede) an eminent Perogatiue; but is it a true position in Diuinity, or false? (take it, for the time, but as a question asked, not now to be debated.) If false, then without controuersie, the great master of Controuersies hath fondly erred in setting downe such an vnlimited Maxim: If true, why then doe not the Romish Catholikes of England obey the Temporall Lawes of the Realme, by his Maiestie established? or by what Diuinity can the same Bellarmine, di

For how can a King defend Religion, that is, repell Heresies, suppresse Schismes, and see that the Faith of Christ bee sincerely professed within his Kingdomes, and yet bee a Gouernor in Ciuil causes onely, and not in spirituall? can a King be a Protector of that, with the violation and breach whereof he may not intermeddle as a Gouernour?

taken by the track or sent, hath earth'd himselfe backe a gaine into the 92. page and there breakes ground, where his Maiestie shewed the Cardinall what wrong he had done Gregory the Great, in saying that hee assumed vnto himselfe the title of Caput fidei, the Head of Faith. In consuring whereof, the Epistler first differs from Bellarmine▪

                  erres as a locall priuiledge to the See Apostolicke (which perhaps they will reconcile, by making them two, the Pope and See, tearmes conuertible.) Secondly, he repeates his Maiesties interpretation, refutes it not; but labours vpon the second answere, where his Maiestie said, that if the interpretation and sense which he had giuen, would not be admitted, he might then as well dismisse Gregory (suppose he spake in his owne behalfe, as they would haue him) as Bellarmine often casts off many of the Fathers [minus ca
                        •…

               147 And what hath hee found in his search? That the Apologer cannot defend himselfe from WILFVLL EXAGGERATION & VOLVNTARIE MISTAKING, because that speech is vsed but onely in one of those places, marginated by his Maiesty, and there vttered of Lyra a recent Paraphrast, not of any Father.   But hee that reades the place, shal finde both an explicit contradiction, & Numb. 25. 8. a double trans-fixion, like that stroake of Phinees (for force, not for zeale) pearcing with one speech through two at once, For in the very next precedent Paragraph, Lyra 
                  Bellar. de. Rom. Pontif. lib. 2. cap. 10.

                  follow Hierome in that his opinion; there's the Contradiction: for how could Lyra thwart ALL the Fathers, when he had what he said from Saint Hierome. Secondly, hee had Hierom for his Author, in saying as he did, although therein he spake not so aduisedly (saith the Cardinall) whereby he strikes them both at once; and Hierom rather then Lyr

                     m was much more vnaduised to vtter such a thing of his owne head. Briefly, was the opinion Orthodox and true? then was not Lyra to be blamed: was it vnsound and not iustifiable? then was Hierom touched by the Cardinall, and not Lyra. In the other place, the verie words [minus caute &c.] are not at all, but the sence of them to the full; for Bellarmine saith there, that some of the 
                  De Christo. li. 2. ca. 2. ad secund. 
                  Fathers doe sometimes erre, that is, speake vnaduisedlie or worse, and that therefore he followes them not in their singular opinions, when ONE crosseth the rest; & I trow that singularitie is either an vnaduised, or a wilfull error. Where is now the Apologers VOLVNTARIE MISTAKING? the places for quotation, and the speech for substance being truely alleadged.

               150 But heere againe the Vermin hath out stript vs, and is scudded as farre as pager 08 where his Maiesty setteth

downe the base and meane stiles & titles which Bellarmine giues to Kings: and the first is, that Kings are rather slaues then Lords, which charge by his maiesty, the Censurer (according to his custome) calls an outragious  proposition, an intemperate accusation, & a shameful. But how doth he confute it? euen like a vaine & frapling surueyor who taking vpō him to make a terrar of some mens lands discribes the scituation, & discourses of the quality of the grounds and medowes that lie about it, but of the contents of the land it selfe, hee saies nothing: for after the Epistler hath spent three whole nūbers, to tell vs what 
                     excellent Arguments Bellarmine hath made in two or three Chapters THERE-ABOVTS to confirme the authoritie of Kings against the Anabaptists: (but in no case against the Pope) and of the difference of Se

For the Cardinall first laying his diuision of a two-fold Subiection, Ciuil and De lai

                  Despoticall, this last he saith to bee propria seruitus the true & proper Seruitude or Slauery: then shewing the difference betweene these two; that the politike subiect serues for his owne commodity, not for others, but the true note of Seruile subiection is to serue for anothers, not for his owne benefit; vpon these, the conclusion which he inferreth is: that if there bee any seruitude in a State politicke (as there must needs) the King ought to bee called propriè seru
                        •…
                     s, and his reason is, because he serueth not for his OWNE benefit, but for OTHERS. Now lay these together; HE is PROPERLY a slaue or vass all, which serueth for an OTHERS commodity, NOT for his owne, but a King serueth NOT for his OWNE, but for his SVBIECTS behoofe; Ergo, What is this thē but to cōclude Kings to be mancipia, slaues in the right kind, vpō his premised diuisiō & difference, if it be right.
               151 The second is; that Kings are not subiect onely

to Popes, to Bishops, to Priests, but euen to De acons 
                  
                     This is Saint Chrysostomes (saith the Epistler) not Bellar mines.  
                     Hom. in Mat. 83.
                   That's not so, though the Cardinall wil needs fasten it vpon him. The particular instance, which followeth of keeping men (though of the highest place and condition) from the Communion, because therein the Deac
                        •…
                     ns power goes beyond Kings, this indeede is Chrysostomes, but the preamble generall is Bellarmines, when he sayth, that Chrysostome doth subiect Kings euen to DEACONS. Therefore vnto him may the Poets verse be applied,

                     At malè cum recitas incipit esse tuus.
                  
                  Chrysostomes speech was good, as it is confined by him to Martial. such an high Ecclesiasticall function; for no man euer denied, that Priests had more authority then Kings in such Cases of ministeriall dueties; but is the conclusion thereupon sound or honest, therefore Chrysostome maketh Kings inferior to Deacons? yet this was Bellarmines Sophistry to put in the words of Chrysostome, Si indignè adeat, cohibe et coerce, as if that holy Father had meant indefinitly of any morall accesse, or coertion ciuill; whereas he onely speaketh of comming to the Lords Altar or Table to receiue the Communion: if THEN the Priest know the King to be a notorious, and publikely scandalous sinner, and continueth therein, to the offence of God & Church, without repentance, he might in that case, and for that time forbeare to minister vnto him. But that Bellarmine meant īn all Cases whatsoeuer, is manifest by that speech, which (out Ia Psal. 98. of Saint Augustine) hee citeth in that very place, that Moses was therefore a Priest because he was the greatest, nam Sacerdote nemo maior, for no man could bee GREATER then a Priest; which, as propounded by Bellarmine, he that reades it, would thinke that Saint Augustine abased Kings belowe Priests in all things (a conceit, which was euer farthest from that holy Father) and yet, distingue tempora, at that time (in Israeli) t'was true, before there was a King for hereditary Succession: for as the same father sheweth

else-where, the State of Israel was then to be intituled Regnum Sacerdotale, a Priestly Kingdome.

A mannerly Prelate surely, both to drinke afore the Emperor, & to balke him after; but the reason added by the Historian is notable, Nullum existimans digniorem quipost se biberet, because hee thought no man there more worthy to drinke after him then the Priest: and no meruaile, for Saint Paul had taught them both that rule,

Had Bellarmine excused the Bishop, that his SO doing proceeded of modestie (as not presuming to drinke, either to the Emperor, or those great Personages) this had beene well, but then it had beene no good Argument to his purpose: had he therefore taxed Sulpitius for his vaine aitrologie, and that reason giuen of the Bishops proud thought, so had he rid himselfe of his imputation; yet then the example had not fitted his intent: but both he and his fellow Cardinal cite and recite the Storie, as in a glorious triumph ouer Kings; for Baronius premiseth this Storie, and that vsage of the Bishop towards Augusta the Queen, with a Non praetermitt

Yet euen that his Deputyship, saith Christ, he had from aboue; there's the Censurer gone: Yea, both of them speake contrary to the light of nature, for blind Homer could see and say

Office in a Citie, that the execution of his authority is from God; but to bee that Officer rather then an inferiour, that is from Men? So to be a King, and not an Earle by the Cardinals rule is from men; but being a King, to rule and gouerne, that's from God. Where is then that other image wherewith S.

and not rightly vnderstanding him, he makes it his owne. For Nazianzens comparison of the Soule and Body is not personal, between himself and the Emperor, (if it were the Emperor to whom he spake, or rather a deputie sub-ordinate, which is the opinion of the Greek Paraphrast) nor between their two Iudicial powers (the Imperiall

The Law presumes euery man to be good till hee bee apparantly naught; but when facts haue beene euident to the contrarie, fairest words, as they couer the deepest treachery, so haue they not with wise men the easiest passage for credence: and therefore the same Law presumes him to be still naught, in that kinde, who hath beene once tainted with a crime.

Now he is vpon Mount Gerazim, and from thence he blesseth our Souereigne; instantly vpon Mount Geball, and from thence he curseth our Religion. Here he braues Deut. 11. 29. it like a Souldier; there he slatters like a Parasite; anon he weeps like a Crocodile; euery where he speaketh in the idiome of a Traytor.
            169 First, he lets flie at the INSTIGATORS, so called by him, but names not who they are; sure by his own descriptiō of them, they must needs be honest men: for he saith, that the principall and chiefe Motors of them are in generall hatred with both extremes of opposites in Religion (that is, the Puritan
                     •…
                  
                and Papist.) Certainely, happy men are they; for it seemes they holde a middle course which is both the safest and best:

                  Est virtus medium vitiorum vtrinque redactum:
               
The mean betweene two extremes is vertue. Herod and Horace. 
               Pilate at opposite iarre each with other, and yet both conspiring against Christ, argue his innocency to be the grea ter: and excellent actions are heereby commended, sayth the Philosopher, when nothing can be added or taken from them; a moderate tracke between a superfluity and a Eth. 2. 
               nullity of Ceremonies, shewes the most religious Conformitie of Scriptures, and Vniformity in a Church. And such, it seemes, is the case of these Instigators.
            
            170 Yea, but these men are interessed in the Rapines and spoiles which their rauenous Purseuants daily bring them home. This, if a true challenge, is a shrewd imputation; if a false, a diuellish Calumniation. DIVINES they be, of eminent place and note, which vse these Purseuants, as publike Officers for search, and forfeiture of Superstitious Reliques, Vessels, and Vestiments, whereunto

by iust authoritie they are warranted by Statute; not with any intention of appropriating thē to priuate vse, for increase of their wealth; that is a base conceit of a Malitious Fugitiue; it is farre from their thought, who are known to be more religiously wise: For first, THIS, they are assured, would make them too openly liable (in the mouth of the Aduersarie) to that imputation of the Apostle, that they did seeke their owne, and not that which is Iesus Christs. Secondly, they know, better then any Iesuite can instruct them, that Mammons Seruice is the basest of all other, especially when it comes in a religious habit. As for other goods, whether of Money, Plate, Utensils, &c, they are not in those searches medled with; if any be (as what man can answer for the particular facts of all inferiour Officers?) who so doth it, as he vtterly peruerteth the true meaning of those eminent persons, to whose trust our most Religious Souereigne committeth those affaires: so, vpon due proofe, he is seuerely punished, and the goods safely restored. And therfore so deepe a charge, till it haue stronger euidence, must passe (with the like) for an impudent Slander; and that it is none other, Fa. Parsons his silence makes it very probable, who is knowen to be a man, neither so tender of mouth, nor so charitable in heart, but that, if he could name the parties, hee would proclaime them, though they were the greatest.

As for these minaced Inconueniences, they can be no greater then some of his Royall Predecessors haue felt, for disturbing their state, and assaulting their life; and his Maiestie also in his time, for treasonable surprises of his sacred Person, with his hopefull issue, and for vtterly extinguishing (though with fire) in a moment, the brightnesse of his glorie, the glorie of his succession, and the succession of any setled good in the future state. (For present there should none haue beene.)

I came not to send peace, but a sword, saith our Sauiour; and therefore happie is that Diuision whereby Religion Matth. 10. 34 is preserued frō mingling, the king from hazzard, and the state from mangling.
            173 Hee hath done with his Maiesties Eyes; and now comes to the Eares, both of his Maiestie, and also of his Counsellors, that they could reach beyond the Seas, and heare the varietie of Discourses, concerning the issues of this pursuit,

for that it must needs weaken the force of the Land both at home and abroad, if there should bee (as heeretofore) forraine warres. And WOE bee to the Authors both of these inward Diuisions and forraine Inuasions, that either cause the one, or procur'd the other, or nourish both, and desire the last: whose encamped power, were it answerable to this writing malice, neither should our walles haue peace, nor our Pallaces plentie. But doubt not you, Fa. Parsons of his Maiesties, or his Counsellors their reaching eares, whereby they can easily conuey from forraine parts perfect intelligence both of the treacherous courses and vnnaturall discourses, which English Fugitiues complot and compile against their natiue Countrie and Soueraigne; & also of the base account those Runnagates are in with forraine States, further then they may make vse of them, for Proditorious and Prodigious mischiefes; because otherwise no wise man will euer trust Traitor, saith the Orator.

            174 O but the Cries and Complaints of these mens afflictions giue a strange admiration; for no such thing was expected from his Maiestie, for many causes. Things strange and vnexpected are admired; but what hath his Maiestie done, either New, or not looked for? Execution of offendors is no Wonderment in a iust iudge; and constancie in the same Religion is no strange occurrent in a Resolued Prince; and prouision for his Securitie is a matter coincident with the prudence of a King. His Maiesties course to distinguish the true from the false-hearted Subiect is made a Wonder of Admiration; but the complots of dreadfull designes against his Maiestie is but a point of sleight regard: such is one miserie which Princes haue (saith the Historian) that Conspiracies, though disc

               admiration should rather be of his Maiesties exceeding clemencie, that, vpon such a monstrous combination, doth not vtterly crush both Damme and spawne of that viperous Brood.
            175. Nor that onely, but it workes a strange alteration in iudgement and affections, saith the Epistler. And who are the parties in whom this change is wrought? If hee meane their Catholikes, whether Writers or Actors, the alteration is none other but that the Prophet speakes of in Ier. 13. 23. the Black-mores skin, and the Leopards spots, the same that hath beene before; the positions of the one in their Tractats and arguments, both for contemptible abasing, and proudly deposing Kings; the complots and attempts of the other for Murder and Treason (the POWDER-PLOT only except, which was singular from all examples) being as mischieuous and dreadfull in former times, as since his Maiesties blessed gouernment ouer vs. For Clement the Pope his Breues, and vn-Clement Parsons his Doleman, with other his Seditious Pamphlets, discouered both the same iudgement for opinion of his Maiesties Religion, and also the same affections for disturbance of his possession before his entry, as since his inuestiture into the Throane.
            176. But hee meanes of Princes and People abroad, whose auersion is inward, howsoeuer they hold external amity. This is but to intimate his imbowelled familiarity with Princes inwards; if as a Councellor of State with them (so, poore Snake, he would be reputed) then is he persidious in reuealing them: Disclosing of Secrecies is the extremity of vnfaithfulnesse in a Councellor: If as a Confessor to them, then is he Sacrilegiously false, and Canonically irregular, by their owne Iesuiticall rules: To reueale what is

confess't, is the height of impietie, for that is to breake the Seale which should not be bruised, say themselues: But withall hee proclaimes them as well for notorious hypocrites, that thus carrie peace in their mouthes, but warre in their hearts; as also for busie Polypragmons in the State of other Nations: for what hath any forraine Prince to do with the managing of another mans Kingdome, either for Religion or Policie, so that neither himselfe nor his Subiects receiue any iniury thereby? but his enuenomed

                to lay an imputation vpon his Maiesties gouernment, carrieth him, perforce, to slander other Princes also with these despightfull reproaches.
            177. Lastly, all this is but a clap out of a Cane, or the cracke of an Alder-stalke, that yeelds more noise then force: for first, doth he thinke Princes to be so idle, or simple, that, for the slanderous reports of a few Fugitiues (male-content either through waiwardnesse of minde, or for differences in Religion) they will fall at iarre, much lesse to open warre, with their Confederate Princes? Yea rather 'tis-supposed, that such Reuolters doe receiue from them, either the like answer which Verdugo (a great Commander vnder the King of Spaine) gaue Sir William Stanley,

            178. But suppose there should bee Kings cast in this Censurers mould, that would arme themselues (vnder pretence of Religion) against our Souereigne, 'tis no more then others haue done before against some of his

worthy predecessors: and his Maiestie knowes there is a Psalme that begins with Quare fremuerunt, which is able to lead them all in Triumph, and teach them, that if they

In the meane time, his Maiesties fauour (we hope) is greater with God; and his Conscience (we are sure) more secured in the right of his cause, & his power more inlarged in the view of the world, then to be afraid of Paper-threats, yea, or armed terrors; that if the triall should come, the wils of his subiects (to vse the Epistlers words against himselfe) will appeare so vnited, as that their forces in their Souereignes defense, shall bee both admirable and dreadfull.
            
            179. From Cries of Complaint, hee proceedes to tell vs of Obloquies and Praiers. A good coniunction, and proportionable to his owne and his associates affections; whose deuout Soliloquies concerning this state, are nought else but reuiling obloquies of the State. To him (by Scripture rule) all Praiers are truly directed, who dwelleth in the light which no man can attaine: and, by Saint Bernards warrant, 1. Tim. 6. 16. Bern. Sent. those Praiers are to him vnacceptable, and in themselues vnauaileable, wherein there is either nulla or nimia lux: either no light at all, as a man being in a darke place that seeth not himselfe (which our Sauiour checketh in their praier that would haue fire from Heauen, You know not 
               Luc. 9. 55. 
               of what spirit you are) perhaps the affections bee mudded with earthly things; or the vnderstanding enueloped with a superstitious darknesse; or the cogitations transported to malitious intents, or vncharitable reuenge: or when there is too much light, men see themselues too well (as the Pharisee that vi

            180. In their Oratories perhaps they pray for our conuersion: But what should bee the ground of these generall obloquies heere mentioned? First, the very Catalogue of English Statutes extant in print against Catholikes, for profession of their Religion.
                If this be the offense, the Obloquies cannot bee generall; for none in those parts vnderstand the language, but a few English Fugitiues; and their calumnious slanders are no more to bee regarded then the curses of that people, which yeerely goe out, and very solemnly reuile the Sunne for scorching their bodies. Heredot. Melpom. If the Offender bee angry with the Law, it is no maruell: yet hee discouereth thereby both a singular impatience, and a bootlesse rage. Hee that will not feare the vigor either of Law or Magistrate, let him doe well. But perhaps these Statutes are translated for other Nations to view: if falsly, then not the Statute, but the corrupt Glosse causeth the Obloquie: a pregnant presumption whereof, Rom. 13. 3. is a moderne practise in that very kinde; for the place is knowen, where those two Statutes made since his Maiesties reigne touching such men, were bee-gored with such bloody additions in another Language, that being compared with the originall, hee that reades them, might truly exclaime as the Poet did, Heu quantum haec Niobe, Niobe distabat ab illa? If truly, neither our State nor Statutes Ouid. need feare any Obloquie, except for Clemencie; since there is no Realme which hath not more seuere Lawes for men of different Religions, and treasonable affections, then all ours are. The speaking of a word, or making the

least signe of dislike to the Religion established, in any point or ceremonie thereof, is Condemnation to the Fire presently, without remission in a Nation whence Parsons hath his best maintenance. And dooth not Cardinall Bellarmine both confesse & commend that rigid course, when he saith that Catholikes will not suffer any among them, qui ostendunt vllo signo, etiam externo, se fauere Lutheranis?

Yea, hee is verie peremptorie, that it is the onely remedie against such, mittere illos maturè in locum suum, betimes to send them their long home: and giues a Idem ibid. cap 21. parag. Secundo. reason for it, because to keepe them aliue (though clapt vp in prison, or banished the land) is no safe course; for that, so they may corrupt their conuersing neighbours with words, and forrein nations with their bookes.
            
            181 And yet this Censurer makes that the second part of those Obloquies, namely the banishing of threescore Priests at one time out of the Kingdom.In describing of which Lamentable Spectacle, he is verie passionately Rhetoricall that men of so good parts, amiable aspects, sweet behauiour, &c. should bee cast out of their natiue soile. It was a graue conclusion of the Senators of Troy concerning Helena, the worlds wonder for beautie and excellent parts (which the Philosopher elegantly applies to any vice, seeme it neuer so delightfull)

               snare and destruction. The Counsel was wise, but the indulgent King refusing it, her stay brought forth twenty foure Bookes of Iliads, and an Iliad of miseries. The like resolution (but with a more actiue execution) was that of our King and State, when they enacted, that, were their birth, personages, and qualities neuer so honourable and admirable, yet hauing viperous hearts vnder their amiable aspects, the Land should bee disburdened of them, rather than

nourish them, vnder pretext of Religion, to alienate true Subiects from their Souereigne, and make them fit for assistance of any enemie, either intestine or forreine, as occation fitted. For what was one of Sauls faults, the sparing of Agag because hee was a goodly man, more regarding his 1. Sam. 15.

               Ioseph. Antiq. lib. 6. cap. 8. for all that, hewed him in peeces. And our Sauiours charge in the spirituall sense for the soules safetie, willing that if a mans right eye (the most amiable member that he hath) doe offend him, hee should plucke it out, and cast it from Mat. 5. 19. him, rather then keepe it to his owne ouerthrow, is as fit in politike aduise for the Realmes securitie: for better those eyes were lost, then the whole state endangered by keeping them in; if they be eyes, or men so extraordinarilie endowed, as this Iesuite makes them. For were they better, then any of them yet could appeare to vpright Iudgements, they haue left behinde them in all respects (both for outward feature, birth & behauiour, and also for inward qualities of nature, art, and grace) men of different Religion, their equals at least; and, which is the true commendation of Christian Priests, of more faithfull and true hearts to their Prince and Countrie: without which, all the rest (in any man) are but the weapons of Disloyaltie, and impietie euen in the Philosophers iudgement.

a banded rout of forlorne fugitiues, as if they were Religious Pilgrims. Sic manus manum fricat, and one Traitor knowes how to bewaile another. Onely this art the Lamenting Iesuite hath in this height of his Impudencie, to conceale the name of TYRONE the chieftaine and ringleader of the rest; whose Rebellious Insurrections in the time of our late Queene (who gaue him his first Nobilitie, beeing otherwise but of a base original) causing the waste of the Lands treasure, and exhausting the blood of too many valiant souldiers, cassiered all hope (euen in himselfe) that his life should be spared, much lesse his case pittied: yet this last reuolt, and contemptuous out-breach, so exceedingly disloyall and vnthankfull to his Gratious Souereigne, who had pardoned him his former treasons; entertained him with fauour; protected him with authoritie; dismi'st him with honour; and followed him with all occasions that might giue a well disposed man contentment, dooth make him so odious and abhominable, that euen Caecilius himselfe that great vndertaker for Verres, and of any bad cause else, would be ashamed to patronize HIM.
            184 Much lesse (as this Jesuite) shroud him vnder the Cloake of Religion, whose prophane life, & heathenish opinions (exprest by his brutish actions) are proclaimed to the world, that hee made no Conscience of Religion; so farr was hee from beeing nice vpon difference in point of Religion: vnlesse to make murther no sinne; promiscuous mariage no Adulterie; Rapine no stealth; oppression no wrong; and Rebellion no disloyaltie, bee the points of Romes Catholike Religion. Otherwise his conscience (so called) was set as free for Poperie as his heart could desire, not in Ireland onely, but while he was in England; where hee had his Masse and Priest without impeachment or disturbance; and with such fauour, that in a search for others, his Pri

But hereby the Readers may cleerely see, what the Epistler meanes by that Libertie of Conscience which hee pleades for so often; namely, immunity to sinne against God; freedome to make port-sale of his natiue Countrie; licence to reuolte from his dearest Soueraigne; conniuence to entertaine treasonable consorts; permission to inrich himselfe for proiected vsurpations; breefly, a generall indulgence to staine the earth with blood, the ayte with blasphemie, the soule with corruptions, the heauen with luxurious Rapines and incontiuencies: and if these may not bee granted, it is such an Angariation of Conscience, as must needes breake out into these retiring euents,  saith the Antapologer; that is to say, into these Traitorly Reuolts from his sacred Maiestie.
            185 Whom this Censurer here vouchsafeth to besmeare with his glauering balme, commending his Maiesties  
                  naturall inclination to sweetnes, peace, and tranquilitie. Which as his Maiestie repelleth with that speech of Ecclesiasticus 
               Eccles. 25. 9. 
               speciosa non est laus in ore peccatoris, that a good mans praise doth no more befitte a wicked mans mouth, then a ring of Prou. 11. 22. gold doth a swines snowt; therefore thinking of him, as Milo did of Vatinius (whose name, for detestation, came into a Catullus. 
               Prouerb) dooth take it for a disgrace, that so lewd a man should offer to commend him: so he demands with all, why being of a disposition so sweete and peaceable (as his Subiects find him, and such Fugitiues confesse him) they should bewray such bad natures, with small wisedome, to vse the meanes which must exasperate and prouoke him? For the quietest spirits once throughly stirred, are not easily allayed: Macrob. Satur nay, the neatest wine if it once turne eager, proues extreamly keene.

               o he bemoaneth his Maiestie, and the State with him, whom hee thinketh, by such Reuolts to be cast into perpetuall Cares about the same.
                Such tender affection issuing from a loyall heart, were very acceptable; but this being vnsound, the other is a coggerie. Kings and States-men haue their Cares, many and great; especially a Monarches Crowne, is, vnto him that weares it rather a Diadema Spinarum, then Gemmarum, and circled with more Cares then Iewels. The more wrong therefore doe they offer to their Soueraigne, who by such contemptuous and disloyall out-leapes augment those Cares, which the breaking out of many more such as these, doe not so much accumulate, as the fomentation of these rebellious practises, by Priests and Iesuites, the principall instigators to such continuall Reuolts and Insurrections. So that who can blame his Maiestie and the State, if, to lessen these Cares, and to preuent such mischifes, they take order to keepe out, and cut off the originall nourishing inflamers, which minister the rechaffment to these disloyall attempts?

Crass. the field, with his ensignes displayed, and his auxiliarie supplies from a potent aduersary; yet then did hee not cast the State into such Cares, but that in the end it brought him on his knees: being now fled, the Care is the lesse; for an open enemy giues more securitie, then an intestine dissembler; and a roauing fugitiue then an home biding Rebell.

The auerment of a troath, should not raise choller through impatience, but incline the minde to beleeue: neither is it the auowing assertion which mooues his patience; for in his owne conscience (though seared) he knowes it, and he knowes that the world, rightly informed, is fully perswaded of the truth thereof: but the diminishing of the hoped number, (which the Pope only expects, and they rely on) by diuers Statutes wisely prouided for, is indeed, that Angariatian of their Conscience which he so tearmes: for raualling of a Confederacie, where affiance is placed in Number, is a tormenting discouragement.
            189 That pang is past; now he is rapt into an extasie of admiration: Wondring why this late Apologie hath beene so published in English and Latine to the world? First, for the publishing: to that end it was done, which is the generall intendment of all writing; which in Scripture is twofold, Diffusio & duratio, that it might both disperse it selfe to Psal. 102. 18. publike view: and remaine also to posteritie. Secondly, for

the double Language; therefore it was done, that both strangers might bee therewith acquainted, and also that it might be freed from corrupt Translations, by which Iesustish tricke our Doctrine and Nation are vsually & wrongfully made odious: for both together; that in present and future age, as well fo

               rainers abroad, as friends at home, might on each side see, both his Maiesties prudent and clement course, onely requiring an OATH of his Subiects, for his owne securitie in Temporall Allegeance, after so many attempts by that bloòdy Generation; and also the Popes frampold dealing, who not only redoubled an encountring Prohibition, but his Champion Bellarmine also brandished a violent dissuasion; hee to the Catholikes in generall; this to the Arch-Priest in particular; both of them disallowing and reproouing that, which whole Councels ancient haue warranted, and holy Bishops haue neuer denied to any Emperors.
            
            190 Why, 
                  but the Popes Breues were written priuatelie to the Catholikes of England.
                The nature of any writing is iudged, not by the Secrecie of the Conueiance, but by the Authoritie of the writer; especially, if in a publike cause, and to many persons: Familiar Epistles are Secrets; Breues from Popes are Writs vpon Record: lest therefore the succeeding age, finding such Precepts in the Registrie, might perswade themselues of the Popes Souereigntie for England, the Apologie, to preuent such mischiefe, hath crush't that conceit, disclaiming his proud vsurpation, and proclaiming him for a busy-body where he had no command; for what hath a Bishop in Italie to doe with the Subiects of Great Brittaine? To informe their Consciences, saith the Epistler, or rather to infect them; and by a Spirituall Tyranny to countermand with an Interdiction, what they of themselues were most willing and ready to performe; being afore perswaded, that it was most consonant to Gods Religion, and Christian duty.
            
            191 But Bellarmines letter was

                  written onely to a priuate
                  
friend. True, but neither of them both was a priuate person; the one a Cardinall, the other an Arch-priest: nor was it written to be kept priuate; for scarcely was it read by him, but Copies were dispersed. Wherein his Maiestie seeing not onely his Publike Act, but his Sacred Person both scornefully and contumeliously handled (besides the generall infection which this Pharisaicall trebled Leauen, though secretly conueied, might worke by contagion) thought it stood him vpon in honour, both to make the worlde Iudge of these irreligious passages from Rome, and also to discouer as well the wickednesse of their purpose, as the weaknesse of the arguments produced by this couple of Grand-Clerkes in their seuerall encounters.
            192 Ye but by this publishing of them, first, diuers will hold themselues obliged, or prouoak't to answer the same. What, after Tortus and Parsons? If they shall doe it better, that will be a shame to the Cardinall: if worse, a staine to themselues: Onely this comfort they haue, that worse then the Censurer hath done they cannot answer. Howsoeuer they doe, either better or worse, let them assure themselues it will not passe with silence:

                  
                     Longus post me ordo est, idem petentium decus, saith he in Liuy. 
                     Scaeuola lib. 1.
                  
               
            
            193 Secondly, The vnlawfulnesse of the Oath will bee disputed, and condemned in all Vniuersities, Schooles, and Bookes of particular men. 'Tis a good counsell that the Poet giueth, not to take measure of another mans foot by Horace. your owne Last. Vniuersities haue more iudgement and discretion then a single Cardinall, or one scribling Iesuite. Dispute the Question they may; but before they condemne the OATH, they will bee aduised; or if they doe, they shall not bee seared: truth hath as strong armor as falshood can shew. Yet the Censurer, being no greater Clerke then the Priests make him and this booke shewes him, had done wisely, first to expect such a Schoole-determination: but ignorance will euer presse forward; and a boyling stomacke

cannot conceale or retaine the inclosed rancor.
            194 Thirdly, The vniust violence in forcing men to sweare, and notwithstanding to make them say that they doe it willingly, and without coaction, will appeare both to be one of the greatest Contradictions in it selfe, and most iniurious to Christian men that euer was heard. How oft hath it beene answered, that a peine vpon a Statute is no inforcement of the Conscience, which hath libertie left both to demurre, and refuse? after which demurre to reiect it vtterly, argueth an ouert disloyaltie; to take it, and not willingly, implieth a Couert treacherie: the Law punisheth the first vpon the plaine discouerie; it requireth the last for the more sure discouerie. Where is now the Contradiction either express't or infolded? The Law insticts a mulct vpon him that refuseth the Oath; there's one Proposition: The same Law inioines him that takes it, to professe that hee sweares willingly; there's the other. If the Oath had been imposed vpon a man to take it whether hee would or no, and withall required of him to say that hee tooke it willinglie, this had indeed beene Contradictorie: but ill lu

            195 What is the second greeuance?

                  rious to Christian men  (saith he.) Euery iniurie is, according to the name, either an iniustice against some Law, or a wrong offred to some persons right. Now what Law doth the taking of an Oath, to be heartily true vnto the Natiue Souereigne for his Temporall Securitie, either defeat, or thwart? As for the persons, a partie consenting to an action, cannot bee said to receiue a wrong by that Action. But his Consent is inforced.No; Libertie of choice is no inforcement of consent. But if he doe it not, hee incurres the danger. True, that's a punishment for his contumaci

               because what

                   that God would incline his Maiesties heart to take the best course for vniting his subiects wills, but his Praier is with a vengeance, that if God will not so incline, Despaire, the mother of headlong precipitation will enter; for patience prouok't will turne into furie:

               you; but hot spirits must haue fire from heauen if the Luc. 9. 54. gates of a Cittie be but shut against them; for they haue, belike learn'd it of Saint Paul who wils men not to auenge them

            197 Not withstanding all this, there is no remedy but one, and that is 
                  Tolleration; for freindly intreatie (saith hee) would binde vp wounds bleeding on all sides, whereas exulceration makes them fester with greefe and danger.
                
               Sic Sententias loquitur; and neither of them vntrue where the wound is greene, or the cure not desperate: where the cause opprest is good, and the partie cassier'd is innocent. Otherwise most false; for absence of an aduersarie doth alleuiate, the concurrence of opposites dooth exulcerate both griefe and wrath: as the wound dri'de vp, will bleede a fresh at the presence of the murtherer. If therefore,

that remedy denied, there must needes treake out a desperate rage; bee it so, better that a few bee driuen into despaire then the whole state raised into a commotion, which nothing sooner then Tolleration of TWO diuers Religions in one Realme. Interim, these

               , false fires, and paper-threates Eras Chil. Cent. 4. are bootelesse, where the wrath is forcelesse, and the denouncer gracelesse.
            198 But is not the very vp-close of all, a plaine Contradiction, to these precedents? 
                  To Gods holy prouidence, (saith hee) then hole is to bee committed; who for his greater glorie, whether to life or death, will dispose of all.
                
               Threates of reuenge for pretended pressure, and totall committing the same to Gods prouidence, are meere opposite. HIS Sacred prouidence is to keepe Kings Persons, and their authoritie Sacred: that is, free from touch of disgrace, or dismay of terror, by any hu mane power. Obedience of the Subiect is the safe gard hee hath appointed for that immunitie: any Doctrine

                  •…
                
               charme them with fraudulence. To affray Kings liuing and reuile Princes dead, argueth neither trust in Gods prouidence, nor reference to his glorie. Controuersies in Diuinitie, there may, there must be; but Schooles and Clerks haue nought to doe with Princes Crownes, saue in dutie to obey, and with learning to support them: so may the end of all turne to his glory, of whole glory there is none end. But RELIGION turned into STATISME, will soone prooue AT HE IS ME.
            
            FINIS.
