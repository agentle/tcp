               FOR AS MVCHE (RIGHTE HONORAble)
as the office of man ſtandethe chyefely in two
poyntes, the one, to ſerue God as he him ſelfe hathe
appointed, the other, truely to ſerue his countrey and
to wiſhe wel to the ſame in al that he mai, I thought
it good to turne into oure Engliſhe tonge: theſe two
Bokes folowing, therby to proffyte ſuche, as are not
of ſeruile ſpiryte, and when I had endyd the ſame, I beth oughte me of
ſome worthye patrone: to whom I moughte dedicate the effecte of my
ſmale trauayle in that behalfe, and diſcourſynge in my ſelfe of dyuerſe
men, I thoughte your honor a very meete man to accepte my ſymple
preſent, not, for that I am your man, and you my very good lorde, and
Maiſter but, in reſpecte of thoſe rare vertues whyche in your honour I
knowe to reſte. Wherfore, my humble requeſt is, that your lordſhyppe
wyll take this my poore trauaile in good parte, which beinge graunted
maye be an occaſyon to ſtyrre me vp to take in hande here after, ſome
greatter matter. The one of theſe Bokes is writen in the Italian by Maiſter
Andre Cambine: a Citizen of Florence, which declareth frō whence
the Turckes came: when they fyrſte came into the leſſe Aſia, of what
condition they were, the warres that they made and vpō what nations
they made them, the victories that they obtayned: and howe they vſed
them, & the whole meanes wherby they attained to that mightie ſeate
in the whiche they nowe ſytte and commaunde, to the great diſhonor
of the Chriſtian princes. The other is a Commentarie wrytē alſo in the
Italian, by whom, I knowe not, for that the name of the auctor is ſuppreſſed
but whatſoeuer he be that dyd it, he hathe deſerued to be well
thoughte of for his trauayle, for it is well worthe the redding. It intreatethe
of the warres betwene Amorathe the ſeconde, Mahomethe the ſecond
his ſonne, Emperours of Turckye, and the moſte worthye prince
George Caſtrioth: otherwvſe named Scanderbeg prince of Albania, in
the which Boke is euidently ſeen, to howe great purpoſe and effecte it
is to haue a Captaine of perfect iudgement, and a 
                  •
               ouldiour of tryid diſciplyne.
And for ſo much as I haue here occaſion to ſpeke of ſuch knowledge
as makes a ſouldiour & I terme diſcipline I thincke it not encouuenient
ſome thinge to ſaye therof, not at large (for that it wyll ſufficiently
fyll a great volume) but briefely as I maye of ſo weightie matter.Of diſcipline and wherin it conciſteth
This diſciplyne conteyneth in it, the whole force of the warres, the
roote therof is the perfecte iudgement of the Captaine the braunches
are theſe, the good choiſe of the newe ſouldiours, obedience of the ſouldiour,

the contynuall exerciſe of the ſouldiour, order, wherin the ſouldiour
muſt be inſtructed, furniture wherwith the ſouldiour muſt both
defend and offend, and then the ſeueritie of the Captaine in ſeinge this
diſcipline truely obſerued and kept A. worthye generall is of that perfection
that he cā vſe any of theſe in his kinde, and I deſyre of god that
this diſciplyne maye be better knowen in oure countre then it is, ſo
ſhall we not haue ſo manye as we haue: that ſhall ſaye, giue me the vntrayned
ſouldiour and take the trayned that lyſte,The trained ſouldiour is to be prefarred to the vnſkilful. of whoſe opinion I
for my parte nether am ne wylbe, for ſo muche as I thincke I ſhalbe able
to proue both in theſe oure daies and alſo in the olde worldes, that
the diſciplined ſouldiour hath alwaye acheuid the great enterpriſe, the
vntrained hath often ben ouerthrowen, but ſeldome or neuer hath gyuen
ouerthrowe. And to proue this true: theſe men are redie whoſe names
doe here folowe (beſyde the whole troupe of hiſtoriens els) Liuie,
Plutarcke Ceſar Appian Alexandrine Valerius Maximus Vigetius, Blondus
Herodian, Paulus Iouius, & the Cōmentarie of George Caſtrioth as here after
more playnely ſhall appeare. I thincke theſe ſufficient to perſwade
anye man that is of a modeſt ſpirite in that behalfe. And for ſo muche
as this diſciplyne is of ſo greate valewe I thincke it not vn
                  •
               itting or vnfrutfull
to touche euery braunche briefely in particular, and fyrſt I wyl
begynne with the electiō & choiſe of the newe ſouldiour, Sertorius
a worthy Romane who being the chiefe gouernour in Spaine after the
death or Silla,The choiſe of the ſouldiour and what is to be required therein and beinge a man of a noble corage and of great iudgment
in Martiall affares (as Appian Alexandrine witneſſeth of hym in
his fyrſte Booke of the Ciuil warres of the Romanes) was not more honored
for anye of the rare vertues that were in hym t
                  •
               en for his greate
iudgement in the choyſe of newe ſouldiours, his opinion was that the
youthe which ſhoulde be choſen to defend theyr countre ſhoulde diſcend
of honeſt parentes they ſhoulde be honeſtly broughte vp, they
ſhoulde be modeſt they ſhoulde alſo feare ſhame as wytneſſyth Vigetius
in his fyrſt Booke of the arte of the warres the, 7. Chapter, Plato that
noble Philoſopher is of opinion that the newe ſouldiour muſt be choſen
of the age of xx. yeres, Seruius Tullius kynge of the Romanes wolde
haue them choſen of the age of xvii. yeres, blando ſayethe that others
are of opinion to choſe them at xvi. yeres of age, Vigetius in his fyrſte
Booke and iiii, Chapiter of the arte of the warres, is of opinion to choſe
them whē their berde dothe fyrſte ſhowe, Saluſte is of opiniō to choſe
them yonge, for as muche as in their youthe they are apte to be taught
anye kynde of exercyſe, and beinge acuſtumed in their youthe to great
trauayle, they ſhall the better when they comme to greater age, endure
the trauaile and miſerie of the warres, he ſaieth alſo that it is better that
the ſouldiours wante yeres, then exercyſe, moreouer, Vigetius ſaieth that
whatſoeuer they lerne in theyr youth dothe contynue longe in theyr
memorie perfectely. All theſe worthye men are of opinion, that yf he
be vntrayned and paſſe the age of thirtie yeres, he is not to be accepted

into a bande: for ſondrie reſpects. This weighty charge to choſe newe
ſouldiours, was not committed to any Captaine but to thoſe that were
of greateſt iudgement and beſt ſeen in the diſciplyne of the warres, as
witneſſeth Vigetius in his firſt Boke and vii. chapter.
            NOwe as touching the obedience of the ſouldiour,The obedience of the ſouldiour. the hiſtories
are full howe greate ſkyll is in it, for what was the cauſe of the
deathe of Pompey and defeicte or ouerthrowe of his Populous armie
in Theſaly, was it not onelye diſobedience? loke Ceſare in his third
Booke and Appian in his ſeconde Booke of the Gyuyll warres of the
Romanes. Hathe not diſobedience ben alſo the deathe of dyuerſe Romane
Emperours and almoſt the diſtruction of the whole Empire, loke
Herodian and there you ſhall ſee the profe hereof This obedience is a
bande that byndeth the reſt of the braunches of diſciplyne ſo firmely
togyther, that it maketh them to worcke theyr effecte and gyueth vertue
& power to euery of them. Wherfore Andre Cambine iuſtly doth
ſaye, that a diſobedient armie is leſſe to be feared, them a worthy Captayne
withoute an armie.
            THe worthye men of the olde worlde and chiefely the Romanes:The exercyſe of a ſouldiour.
broughte vp their ſouldiours in ſondrie exercyſes, as to runne, lepe
throwe the bare, ſwyme, to vſe their weapons, to marche the march
called Paſſo militare, which was to goe armed in the hoteſt of the ſommer
xx. myles in fyue houres, and vpon great occaſion: xxiiii. myles in
foure houres, they had a feelde which laye vpon the ſyde of the Ryuer
Tibre which once was of the poſſeſſiō of Tarquinus ſurnamed the proud
and when he was baniſhed Rome, the Senate appointed that feelde for
the exercyſe of theyr ſouldiours, there were in that feelde a number of
greate ſtakes depely ſet into the grounde, againſt whom the ſouldiours
hauing their roundels made of wicker of the double weighte of thoſe
whiche they ſhoulde were in battayle and a ſtaffe of the lengthe of a
ſworde and of the double weyghte of the ſworde whiche commonly
they dyd weare, and beinge thus furniſhed they ſhoulde dayly fyghte
againſt thoſe ſtakes as againſt their enemyes. In this feelde dyd they
vſe all theyr exercyſes, wherof I ſpake before and when they were wery
they went into the Riuer and waſhed them, and refreſhed theyr weried
bodies and lerned to ſwime, as wytneſſeth Vigetius in his fyrſt Boke
and x. Chapter. To ſwymme wel is and exerciſe very commodiouſe for
a ſouldiour, as for example Liure in his fyrſt Decade and ſeconde Boke
declareth that Oratius Cocleus a worthy Romane,Suimming Neceſsarie defended the ende of
the brydge that putteth ouer Tiber, againſt the whole power of the
kinge Porſena whileſt that they of the Citie brake the bridge behinde
him, and then (armed as he was) he leapte into the Ryuer from the
brydge and dyd ſwymme to the lande, and ſaued both him ſelfe & the
Citie for that tyme. Alſo the noble Emperour Iulius Ceſare beinge in
Alexandrie and aſſayled vpon the ſudden by the Alexandrines (and hauing
but fewe of his people with him) was enforced to flee their furie

whervpon he lepte into the Ryuer and dyd ſwyme ouer: to the other
ſide, by the which meanes he ſaued his life at that preſent, as witneſſeth
Appian Alexandre in his ſeconde Booke of the cyuyll warres of the
Romanes, and alſo Aulus Hirtius in his fourthe Booke of the Commentaries
of Ceſar intitled de Bello Alexandrino the lyke dothe the ſame
Aulus Hirtius declare in the aforeſayde Booke, of the Ph
                  •
               ritanes, whiche
dwelled in an Iſle that ſtandeth in the Ryuer Nilo eyghte hūdred paſes
from Alexandrie, which beinge aſſailed by the ſouldiours of Ceſare and
put to flyghte, toke the Ryuer and did ſwyme to Alexandrie and ſaued
a great number of theyr lyues. The exerciſe of the ſouldiour and chiefely
of the vſe of the weapon that he ſhall vſe in the feelde is a thinge of
great valewe,The vſe of the weapon. whiche the Romanes dyd ſo muche eſteme that they appointed
a number of Maiſters to inſtructe theyr ſouldiours in the vſe
therof, and euery Maiſter had double the entertaynement that a ſouldiour
had, as witneſſeth Vigetius in his firſte Booke and xii. chapter, and
in my iudgement not withoute great reaſon, for the felde is not the onlye
place to traine ſouldiours in but they muſt alſo be made perfecte in
the vſe of theyr weapon in marching in theyr armour, acuſtumed to order
and ſuch lyke exercyſes, before they cōme to the felde, otherwyſe
they be but an encoraging to the enemy and a people led to the ſlaughter,
wherfore the Romanes had their newe ſouldiours as perfecte in altheyr
exercyſes as were theyr olde ſouldiours (before they wolde ſend
them to the felde) ſauing in that that they had not ſeen the enemy nor
felte of his force.
            An other braunche therof is of importance,The neceſſitie of Armour. which is furniture with
oute the which no army is perfecte, for yf a man be neuer ſo valiante &
well trayned yf he wante furniture he wyll not put him ſelfe in that
peryll that he wyll doe beinge well armed and furniſhed. As longe as
the Romanes went wel armed and furniſhed to the felde their Empire
dyd alwaye floriſhe as witneſſeth Vigetius in his firſt Boke and xx. chapter,
but whē they became ſlouthfull and neglected diſcipline, they then
obtayned of their Emperours within ſhorte ſpace licenſe to goe to the
felde firſt withoute their body Armour, & then withoute their ſheldes
and hedpeces, and when they had obtained at theyr Emperours handes
theſe noble demaundes, within ſhor
                  •
               e ſpace after they payd well for
their caſe, the Gothes & Vandales, and alſo the Lombardes made warres
vpō them & gaue them ſondrie ouerthrowes. Then was the difference
ſeen betwyne the armie broughte vp in diſciplyne and that wherein diſciplyne
was not knowen, betwine the exerciſed ſouldiour and the vnexerciſed,
betwine the inſtructed ſouldiour and the ignorant, betwine
the armed ſouldiour & the vnarmed, & betwyne the Captaine of iudgment
and the vnſkylfull Captaine, for where as in tyme before the Romanes
(dwelling vnder diſcipline) were not onely able to defend their
owne moſt ample dominions: but alſo that of their fryndes which laie

fardeſt from them: nowe, when they had reiected diſcipline (hauinge
warres with theſe nationes afore named) they were not onely vnable
to defend their owne dominions: but alſo to defend their Citie Rome
which was twyſe or thrieſe ſacked by the aforeſayd enemies, as wytneſſeth
Carian in his hiſtorie.
            There is alſo order,Order, of great importance. which is of great value, and withoute it an armie
is but a confuſed multitude, nether any battayle is worthily fought no
towne perfectly beſegyd, nor any thing well done. This the auncient
Romanes had in ſuche eſtimation, that whoſoeuer dyd violate it, was
pūniſhed withoute remiſſiō, as for example Valerius Maximus in his ſecond
Boke declareth: that Poſthumius Tibutius being dictator, & hauing
with him in the warres his onely ſōne the only ſucceſsiō that he had,
whō he had very tenderly & carefully brought vp, yet foraſmuch as he
being in the warres did (of him ſelfe & not by his cōmaūdemēt) take
thoſe bands which the Romāes called aides, or helppes, & encoūtred the
enemies & gaue them a great ouerthrowe, & thē retorned to the campe
with the victorie, as ſone as he came to his father, he commaunded to
ſtrike of his hed,Examples of ſtrange punniſhements for breche of order. ſo carefull was he to ſe order obſerued that he preferred
it before the life of his ſonne, the contynuance of his houſe and all
that euer he poſſeſſyd in the worlde. The like did Poſthumius Torquatus
(beinge Conſul) to his ſonne in the warres of Italie, who gaue battayle
to the enemies withoute commaundement from his father, defeicted
them, and ſlewe a great number of them, and alſon toke from them a
maruelous riche ſpoile and retorned with the victorie, yet at his retorne
his father commaunded the offycers to take him, and ſo was he executed.
Alſo Papirus the dictator did maruelouſſy embrace order. And whē
he made warres againſt the Sānites, he had with him general of the
horſemen Q. Fabius Rutilianus, who ſeing his enemy in battaile charged
him, ouerthrewe the Samnites, and retorned with the victorie, yet notwithſtandinge,
Papirus reſpected not the victorie, his vertue, his force,
nor yet his houſe, but commaunded him to be ſpoyled of his garmentes
and to be beaten naked with roddes, a maruelouſe ſtraunge 
                  •
               yghte,
to ſe Q. Rutilianus, generall of the horſemen, a man of great worthynes
victorious, to be beaten naked and to haue hys fleſhe torne by the
handes of the Iuſticiers and alſo hys bloude ſhed, and althoughe
the ſouldiours deſyred Fabius to flee to Rome, where in vayne he
made requeſt to the Senate for pardon, Papirous perſeuered in punniſhinge
hym and wolde in no wyſe for gyue it, the father of
Fabius (who had been Dictaour, and thre tymes Conſul) was
enforced to comme in humble ſorte to declare the matter to the
people, deſyrynge them to craue the aide of the Tribunes in the

behalfe of his ſonne, yet notwithſtanding Papirus perſeuerid ſtyll in his
purpoſe, tyll at the laſt (being deſyred by the Citizens, the Tribunes &
people) he ſware that he wolde forgiue it, not for the loue of Fabio, but
for the loue that he bare to the office of the Tribunes, and to the people
of Rome, this Ordre directe the euery braunche of this diſciplyne &
maketh them to worcke their effecte. What ſhoulde I ſaye anye more
of order, the hiſtories are full of the nedefulnes therof.

               ſe there is alſo ſeueritie which cauſeth the ſouldiours to
dwell in obedience, it chaſeth all diſorder from them, it hath ben executed
in all ages,Seueritie in puniſhment very expedient. Ceſar that worthy Emperour whoſe naturall inclination
to pardone offences was ſuche, that I doe preferre his co
                  •
               tezie before
them al that I haue redde of, yet you ſhal ſee in his commentaries
that he vpon occaſyon hath taken the tenthe man of his legiones and
put them to deathe, alſo Vallo a famous and worthye Captayne who
hath wryten very ſubſtancially thre Bookes of the arte of the warres
exhorteth all men of charge, to be ſeuere when occaſion dothe require,
for one or two ſometime puniſhed doe ſaue great numbers from
diſtruction. Wherfore Vallo in his firſt Boke, and third chapter, willeth
that he that diſobeythe his Captaine, he that dothe mutine, he that beynge
appointed to the ſtand watche or ſcoute doth leue his place with
oute licenſe of his Captaine, or he that departeth from his enſeigne in
the felde withoute leue of his Captayne ſhall not onely loſe horſe, armour,
weapones and all that he poſſeſſyth in the warres, and ſo eſcape
the puniſhment, but he ſhall be condempned to deathe and ſhall paſſe
the pikes in maner as foloweth. There ſhalbe a ſquadrone ordered and
in the myddeſt of the ſame ſhalbe a voyde ſpace throughoute the ſquadrone

Gianizzaries being deſirous to paſſe that winter in Grecia made requeſt

of the Romane counſulles and legates whiche had made
warres againſt them and receaued dyuerſe ouerthrowes at their handes
Scipio receaued the ſame armye which they had ſo often defeicted, and
as ſone as he had poſſeſſed this army,What kind of people are to be baniſhed oute of an armie or campe. he forthewith purged it of all vnprofytable
people: ſuch as procured men to delicacie, as thoſe that ſolde

            The lyke may be ſayd of Metellus, who being Conſul made warres
in Affricke againſt Iugurthe he receaued his armie of Spurius Albinuus
throghe whoſe negligence and want of vnderſtanding, diſcipline was
clerely extincte and forgotten: and the armye vtterly corrupted through
eaſe and delicatie, by meanes wherof the enemy obtained againſt them

ſhoulde carrie it, then he marched with his campe and remoued in

had ben preſent, alſo he ſawe them daily exerciſed acordīg to the
order of the Romane diſciplyne, and in the ende brought them to that
perfection, that to that ſame enemy (of whom they had receaued many
ouerthrowes in tyme before and neuer coulde giue any) they gaue ſondrie
and great ouerthrowes and triumphed ouer him as witneſſeth the
aforeſaid Valerius. Beſyde theſe, Appian Alexandrine in his fourth Boke
of the cyuyll warres of the Romanes: doth righte well declare the price
and neceſſite of the Iudgemēt of the Captaines in the perſones of B

               ius
and Caſſius, who fled oute of Rome after that they had ſlayne Ceſar, and
throughe theyr wyſedome and policie gatherid togyther wythin the
ſpace of two yeres: an armie of xx. legions of foremē, and of xx M. horſe
men, a legion acording to the opinion of Liuie,What a legion i
                     •
                  . had in it the number of
fyue thouſand foure hundred ſouldiours and acording to the mynde of
Vigetius it was of the number of ſyxe thouſand and ſome tyme of greater
number beſyde this they had a Nauie of two hundred great ſhippes
at the leaſte, they were thorowly furniſhed with all kinde of Munition
and well prouided of money, this had they brought to paſſe in the
ſpace of two yeres hauing Octauius ſurnamed Anguſtus, Marcus Antonius &
Marcus Lepidus to enemyes, who then gouerned in the triumuirate at
Rome, and dyd contynually perſecute them with warres by all meanes
poſſyble as the aforeſaid auctor plainly doth declare. Alſo they brought

vnder their gouernaunce all the countres euen from Macedonia to the
floodde Euphrates, beſyde theſe examples the hiſtories are full of the
praiſes of worthy generalles, but by the way I wolde not that any man
ſhoulde thincke that I doe ſo greatly honor the iudgement of the generall:
that I wolde therby condempne diſcipline in anye reſpecte in the
which I wolde haue the ſouldiour broughte vp and trained, but I doe
thincke it as requiſite that the generall with his chiefe officers of the
armie, be of iudgment ſufficient to directe the vſe of this diſciplne, as it
is for the ſouldiours to be brought vp and inſtructed therin, and the armie
that wanteth eyther of them: to witt the diſciplined ſouldiour and
the generall of iudgment is not perfecte, nor ſufficient to take any great
enterpriſe in hand.
            There is nothing more proffytable nor mete to bring a generall to
this perfection then to adde to his experience the reding of hiſtories in
the which he ſhall ſe plainly ſet before his eyes in what order battailes
haue ben foughte, ouerthrowes gyuen, victorie vſed, countres defended
and conqueſtes made, wherfore if the generall with his chiefe officers
wante this perfection they are not greatly to be feared althoughe their
armi be of trained ſouldiours. Furthermore their is nothing more to be
embraced by a worthy generall, then modeſty, and there is nothinge

for example at the battayle of Canua,A generall muſt be void of ambition and raſhenes. as plutarck declareth in the ſecond
part of his lyues: in the lyfe of Fabius Maximus and alſo of Aniball, howe
that both the Romane conſulles were there peſent the one was Paulus
Emitius a man of great iudgment and worthynes in armes, the other
was Caius Terentius Varro a vaine and wylfull man, full of ambition, glory,
& boaſting. This Terentius coulde not be contentid to gouerne iointly
with his companion and to vſe mutual councell, but wolde haue the
gouernement deuided and wolde gouerne euery other daye abſolutely

which the Italianes call Veſte militare, this did he directly againſt
the wyll of his companion, when Aniball ſawe this he was excedyng
glade for it made well for his purpoſe: for he was in great extremetie
throughe wante of victuall, Terentius had double the number of ſouldiours
that Aniball had. His ſouldiours were well trayned and broughte
vp in diſcipline whom he put in ordre and gaue battayle, the horſe of
Emitius was ſlayne vnder him and he foughte on fote lyke a noble man

at the laſte Cornelius Lentulus a noble yonge man came by him & knew
him, he lighted immediatly from his horſe aud deſyred him to lepe on

of the promes that he made vnto him, and that he was not ouercomme
onely by Aniball, but alſo by Terentius, and with ſuche commendations
he licenſed Lentulus, and then he fell downe amonge the ded bodyes &
gaue vp the ſpirit. Here was ſeen to the great hindrance of the Romane
Citie the difference, betwyne the modeſtie of Emilius and the arogancie
of Terenrius, Liuie ſaith that in this battayle there were ſlayne xl. M fote
men and two thouſand ſeuen hundred horſemen, pollibie declareth of a
great number but trueth it is that the Romanes nether in the fyrſt nor
ſeconde warres of the Carthagvnenſes receaued a greatter ouerthrowe
then this, for ſo muche as Emilius the Couſul a man of great worthines
and vertue redi in all doutes towarde his countre with Seruilius whiche
was Conſul the yere before, and a number of worthye Citizens eles,
who had byn Conſulles, pretors Tribunes, Ediles and inche lyke, were
there ſlayne.
            The lyke happened in Puglia and other tyme: Fabius Maximus being
then dictator, Anibal determyned to winter with his army in a Citie
named Glereon, a Citie of great welthe Fabius encamped as neare
him as he mought conueniently, and being called to Rome (for ſondrie
great affares of the common welthe) lefte his armie vnder the conducte
of Marcus Minutius with expreſſe commaundement nether to aſſayle
the enemye ne yet to gyue battayle in anye wyſe. It happened after the
departure of the dictator a ſquadrone of the enemies to goe forthe into
the countre for corne, Minutius hearing of it brake the commaūdemēt
of the dictator & marched forth with certaine bādes & encountred the

enemy and chaſed them home to theyr very lodginges & flewe a great

and Minurius: a thinge or that tyme neuer ſeen, Fabius endured al
theſe thinges patiently and retorned to his campe, they were then two
dictators, Minutius throughe this lytle ſparke of good happe, dyd clene
forget him ſelfe and toke vpon him withoute the aduiſe of Fabius to

Minutius being an arrogante,Note the arrogancie and wilfulnes of Minutius. ambitious and prowde man, and not of
great iudgment in the diſcipline of the warres cauſed Fabius to ſtand in
great doute, leſt that he being thus excidingly puffed vp in pride ſhulde
take in hand ſome matter that mought greatly hurte the cōmon welth
wherfore he came to Minutius and deuided with him the armye, thinc
king it better for him to gouerne only ſome parte of the army then cō
               fuſedly
with his inſolent companion to gouerne the whole. Whervpō
he toke to him the firſt and fourth part of the Romane ſouldiours and
gaue to Minutius the ſecond and third part the lyke dyd he by the ſouldiours
that they cal aydes, when Minutius ſawe him ſelf dictator equal
with Fabius and that he had an armie at his commaundement, he was
in great triumphe, Fabius badde him to take hede and to confider that
nowe it was not with Fabius that he muſt haue to doe, but with Aniball,
and vpon this Fabius cauſed his drommes and trompetts to ſound
and marched oute of the campe and went to a grounde that he lyked
and there encamped with his people.
            Anibal vnderſtanding of this, approched neare to them both and encamped
in a ground of ſtrength and had betwene him and his enemies
grounde very apte to ambuſhe his people in, and when he ſawe Minutius
deuided from Fabius he thought it good to preſent the battayle to
Minutius and in the night ordained and placed his ambuſhes and appointed
them a ſigne at the which they ſhoulde ſalie. When the daye
came he ſent certaine bands to take a hill not far from Minutius to prouoke
him to battayle, Minutius forthwith: ſent forthe his lighte armed
men and attached the ſcaramoche and ſeing Anibal to ſupplie frō tyme

               ll he put his whole armie in order, and marched forth and ioyned
with the enemy in battaile, the fyght was cruel, the Carthaginenſes retired
and fought contynually vntyll ſuch time as they had drawne him
paſt their ambuſhes, then Aniball gaue his ſygne, wher
                  •
               pon the ambuſhes
diſcouered them ſelues and aſſayled the Romanes behinde them
with great rumor, noyſe, and ſlaughter, when Minutius torned him and
ſawe the diſorder that was amonge his people, and his Captaines fleing
he ſoughte to ſaue hym ſelfe alſo by flyghte, whervpon the Numidan
horſemen folowed the chaſe, and made great ſlaughter of the

diſorderid Romanes.
            When Fabius ſawe the Romanes in this extremitie, the which he
ſuſpected in the begynning of the battayle he went to a certayne place
from whence he mought beholde the whole mattet and ſeing the Romanes
gathered in the middeſt of their enemies ſtrake his hand vpō his
thyghe and with a great ſighe ſayd in the preſence of al thoſe that were
with him, O Hercule, ſōner then I wolde haue wiſhed & not ſo ſone as
he him ſelfe wolde, Minutius hath vndone him ſelfe and his, whervpon
he commaunded his armie to marche and ſaid O ſouldiours whoſoeuer

not happned (acording to his deſyre) that he moughte put the enemies
to flyght we ſhall here after haue time to blame him for it. Then he encountred
the Numidianes, charged them, and put them to flyght and
marched on and encountred thoſe that were laide in ambuſhe in the
nyght and aſſayled the Romanes behynd them in the battayle, he ſlewe
them that the reſte of the Carthagtnenſes ſeyng this, began to fle.
            When Anibal ſawe his people fle and Fabius a farre of very fiercely
amōge the Carthagynenſes, he left of any furder executing of the Romanes
and commaunded to ſound to the ſtandard and then retorned to
his lodginge and ſuffred the Romanes to paſſe to their campe withoute
any further ſlaughter, & it is ſaid that beīg at his lodging & talking of Fabius
he ſaid haue not I often times told you that yonder miſt that laie alway
vpō the hill wolde make vs one day very foule wether. I haue this
day ouercome Minutius and Fabius hath ouercome me. When the battaile
was ended Fabius cōmaūded his ſouldiours to take the ſpoyle of the
ded enemyes, and then retorned to his campe, and notwithſtanding this
great victorye he neuer caſte in the tetle of his companion his euill
gouernement.
            When Minutius came to his campe, he ſpake to his ſouldiours in
this ſorte. My companions in armes, there is nothing more peryllous to
a man then to fayle in gerat matters:Minutius acknowledgethe his folly. and whē he ſeith his owne default
it is the part of a wiſe mā to obey vnto him that hath giuē him good
admonition & althoughe that I haue good occaſiō to be offended with
fortune, yet I muſt confeſſe that I am much bounde to her, for that ſhe
hath gyuen me to vnderſtand euē in an inſtante that I not beyng able
to commaunde others, ſhoulde ſubmitte my ſelfe to the rule of others.
Wherfore let vs goe to the fyrſt dictator and render hym thancks and I
promyſe you that I wyll be the fyrſt, both to thancke him and to yelde
him obedience, when he had thus ſpoken, he commaunded to take
downe the Egles which were the banners of gouernement and marched
with them to the lodgings of Fabius and being comme to the market
place, he went ſtreight to his tent and there dyd ſet vp the Egles
with great noyſes and when Fabius came forth of his tent he came &

called him father, and his ſ
                  •
               uldiours ſaluted the ſouldiours of Fabius by
the name of patrones or Maiſters. When ſilence was commaunded Minutius
ſayd to Fabius thou haſt in one inſtante obtayned two victories
thou haſt ouercomme thyne enemye by force and thy companion by
counſell and cortezie, wherfore I maye iuſtly call the moſt worthy father,
who hath ſaued both me and my people & then ſerued vnder him
as generall of the horſemen as before.
            Hereby it appereth that where thinges ſhall take good effecte▪ it
muſt nedes be that the ſouldiours be broughte vp in diſcipline and that
the generall be able to iudge of diſcipline, as for example liuie in hys
thirde Boke of his fyrſt decade dothe well declare that it was not onely
an armie of trained ſouldiours: that dyd ouerthrowe the people called
Volſci and Equi, but that alſo the conſules & chiefe officers of the felde
were of great iudgement, whoſe good order dyd not à litle preuaile in
that behalfe. Beſyde this it was not only an armie of trained ſouldiours
that diſcomfyted the Samnites not farre from the Citie Sueſſola, where
they ſlewe an exceding great number of them and toke. 40. thouſande
ſheldes which were of the men that were ſlaine, and alſo. 170. ſtandardz
Cornetts, and Euſeignes as wytneſſeth Liuie in his vii. Booke of his firſt
decade, but that alſo the Iudgement of the Conſul dyd muche preuayle
in that behalfe, who when he ſawe the great number of his enemies, cō
               maunded
his ſouldiours to holde them within his campe, whervpō the
Samnites preſuming, contēned the enemie., and neglicted order, and diſperſed
them ſelues all the countrey ouer to prouyde them of corne and
other victualles, and lefte theyr campe vngarded in effecte, which when
the conſul vndeſtode he exhorted the ſouldiours to behaue them valiantly
and immediatly went forth of his campe and aſſayled the campe
of his enemyes, and in the firſt charge he ſlewe the greateſt number of
them as they were in their tentes and lodgings, and then commaunded
to ſet all theyr Cornetts, Enſeignes and ſtandardz, vpon the trenches of
theyr campe which he had taken from them, and then lefte for the
gard of the campe two legions, with commaundement that on payne
of death no man ſhoulde take any thing of the ſpoyle of the campe vntyll
his retorne, whervpon he marched on with his armye in order towarde
the enemy and ſent his horſemen before him, who charged, the
negligent and vnprouided enemyes being diſperſed all ouer the felde
and vtterly deſtitute of order ſo that they fled with great confuſiō and
feare, not knowing whyther it were beſt to fle, whē this was done the
counſul retorned to the campe with great victorie, and then gaue the
ſpoyle of the campe of the enemyes to his ſouldiours. In lyke ſort was
the perfecte order of L. Scipion counſul: no leſſe helpfull to his armye
when that he defeicted the mitghty army of Antioche kyng of Aſia vp
on the Ryuer Phrigio neare to the Citye Magneſia as wytneſſyth Liui
in his fourth decade and vii. Booke. And in lyke ſorte dyd the indgemēt

of Alexādre the great helpe his ſouldiours ī the battayle that he fought
with Darius in the which with a ſmale number of trained ſouldiours
he defeicted 6. hundred thouſand Perſians as witneſſeth Blondo in his
x booke de La inſtitution de La choſe publique. In the lyke ſorte was
the iudgment of T. Quintius Flaminius helpful to his trained atmie whē
he dyd ouerthrowe Philippe the Macedone prince, beſyde Scotuſa in
Gretia, ſlewe viii. thouſands of his ſouldiours and toke fyue thouſand of
them priſoners as witneſſyth Plutarck in his Boke called the ſeconde
part of his lyues, in the lyfe of the ſame Flaminius.
            Beſyde this it was not onely the continuall exerciſe and diſciplyne
of the ſouldiours of Scanderbeg that gaue vnto the Turckes ſo manye
ouerthrowes as are declared in his Commentaries, althoughe they were
becomme throughe their continuall exerciſe as it were inuincible but
his great iudgement in the arte of the warres was a greate parte of the
cauſe therof, for he knewe when and howe to take the aduantage of
his enemye
            Alſo to cōme to oure age in the battayle that Frauncys the fyrſt of
that name Frenſhe king, fought at Marignian with the Suyſſes where
great ſkyll and valiantize was ſhowed on both partes, yet was not the
victorie wonne alone throughe the diſcipline of the ſouldiours but alſo
throughe the iudgement of the conductours. The lyke may be ſayd
of the battayle that the Countie de Augimen fought at Serizoles wyth
the Marques of Guaſto in the yere of oure Lord. 1544 The lyke of the
battayle of Pauie betwyne the aforeſayd Frenſhe kinge and the Duke

               eſſe in Almaigne. What ſhulde I ſaye any more to proue this
to be true, the hiſtories doe all affyrme that the vnderſtandinge of the
generall doth greatly helpe to the obtayning of the victorie, and withoute
it a trayned armie is but as a man mayned in compariſon of a mā
that hath all his līmes ſoūd and perfecte, and of all the victories that I
haue here ſpoken of, and alſo of all thoſe that I haue red of, beſydes
thoſe that I haue ſeen, I haue not founde one gyuen by vntrayned ſouldiours.
Wherfore no armie may be called perfecte that wanteth theſe
two kindes of men in it which is the general of perfecte iudgement &
the ſouldiour brought vp in diſcipline.
            Vigetius ſayeth in his .28 chapiter of his fyrſte Booke of arte of the
warres that the Epirotes and Macedonines people of great power, adorned
with many victories and alſo the Theſalique nation who brought
vnder theyr yoke the Perſians euen to the confynes of India, beſydes
theſe Lacedemonies, Athenies Marſians and Samnites, The Datianes,
Medes and Thratianes which were ſo warlike that it was ſayd amonge
them that Mars (whom the hethen call the god of battayle) was borne
in theyr countre, all theſe nations dyd the Romanes (throughe their perfecte

diſcipline) bring vnder theyr rule.
            Alſo Vigetius ſaithe in his fyrſt Boke and fyrſt chapter of the arte of
the warres,The benifite of diſcipline. that the great number of the Frenſhe ſhoulde haue denoured
the ſmale number of the Romanes, had not ben theyr diſcipline only,
beſydes that it had not ben poſſyble for the Romanes to haue reſyſted
the populouſe & mighty nations of the Germanes but only by theit
diſciplin, moreouer they ſhulde not haue ben able to encoūtte the luſtie
& puiſante nations of Spaine had not ben their diſcipline, yea by what
meanes preuailed they againſt the wiſe and welthy Affricanes, but only
throughe diſcipline, by what meanes brought they vnder yoke the
mighty and ſubtill nation of Grekes, but only by their diſcipline. The
noble Emperour Frederick Barberouſe being entred Italie with his armie
to chaſtize the Millaneſes for their rebellion, wolde in no wiſe offer
warre to his enemies vntill his ſouldiours had fworne vnto him to
obſerue the diſcipline of the warres. Paulus Iouius ſaith that the Hungarians
ſo longe as they dyd obſerue diſcipline were well able to defende
their owne & gaue the Turcks ſondrie ouerthrowes, Val
                  •
               ius Maximus
in his ſecond Boke calleth diſcipline not only, the foundatiō of the Romane
Empire, but alſo the preſeruatiō & maintenance of the ſame, for
in dede it is a harde matter to ouerthrowe a worthy generall, hauinge
an armie of well choſē ſouldiours, obedient, well exerciſed in the feates
afore mēcioned & doe knowe what the weapons are worthe that they
beare being well furniſhed, and well inſtructed in order knowing the
cōmoditie therof ſo longe as in battayle they doe obſerue it, for it is an
impoſſibilitie to gyue any great ouerthrowe we to mē that obſerue their
order in the which they are plaſed & doe vſe their weapons accordingly.
Wherfore I wiſhe al men of honeſt ſpirites to ſeke to vnderſtand the
effecte of this diſcipline, for it doth as muche & more helpe to the obtaining
of victorie, then doth the greatneſſe of the number as Ceſer, Appian,
Vigetius & Plutarcke, chiefly doe declare. Peraduēture ſome mā wil
ſay, why ſir we nede not this diſcipline wherof you ſpeke: we can haue
for oure money ſtraungers which are good ſouldiours to ſerue vs whē
we nede. But ſuch as are of that opinion I wiſhe to rede the hiſtories &
Chronicles of Fraunce,The incō
                  moditie that commeth by the ſeruice of ſtaungers. for Fraunce hath well felte the cōmoditie of the
ſeruice of ſtaungers, which nether ſerue for honor of their countre &
prince, ne yet for their wiues, children, goodes & poſſeſſions, but they
ſeke onely to leade the warres at length & to make their ptoffytt of it,
beſide this I thincke it not inconuenient to ſhowe an example or two
of the good ſeruice of ſtraungers, Mounſer de Lautrec, being in Italie
generall of the Frenſhe armie at the ſege of Pauie, the Suiſſers came vnto
him and required him eyther to gyue them licenſe to repare home in
to their coūtre, or els to goe & encountre the enemies, for they wolde
no lengar tarrie in Italie, whervpon fearinge that the Suiſſers ſhoulde

            A Comentarie of Andre
CAMBINO A FLORENTINE BORNE, OF THE
originall of the Turques, and Empire of the houſe of
Ottomanno.
The firſt Boke.
            
               THE Turquiſh nation after the opinion of
diuers writers chiefly of theſe of

               ate yeres
for that they haue ſene them rule in thoſe
partes where the citieof Troy once was,
and hauynge regarde to their name, haue
affirmed that thei are diſcended from Teu
cxi, from whence the Troians bad their originall, the
which is vtterly falſe, for in dede that natiō which at this
preſent dwelleth in the leſſer Aſia vnder the rule of the
houſe of Ottomann
                  •
               : beinge of nature cruell and barbarous,
toke originall from the Scithianes, and as the philoſopher
Etico dothe declare, had their abidinge beyonde
the montaines called Pyrithei, not far frō the Iſ

               es Tarraconite:
directlye towarde the Northweſt ſea.
            And as Otho, brother to Federyckes father of Auſtriche
being Emperour doth declare, that at the tyme when P
                  •
               
               pine
raigined in Fraunce, theſe people departinge from
the confines of Caſpie were aboute the yere of Chriſte
760. beinge encontred with the people Auari which in
oure time are Hungarians, and fighting betwene them a
cruell battayle, and great ſlaughter on bothe ſydes done.
The Turques not withſtanding continuing their enterpriſe,
ouerran and ſpoyled the contreis of Poutho, and Capadocia
with other prouinces to them adioyinge. And in
the beginning they gathered them ſelues togither ſecretlye
and dwelled vpon montaynes and in ſtronge places,
perillous to aſſayle, and maynteyned them ſelues and
lyued of p
                  •
               oie and ſpoyle, as occaſion was offered them.
After that when they grewe to ſome ſtrength, and were
prouyded of captaynes, and diſcipline, they began with
open warres to moleſt and trouble y• people of thoſe countries
neare vnto them adioyning and to become lordes of
their contreis, and theſe people not being able to ſtande
againſt and to endure their force, and crueltie, were enforced

forced to giue place: ſo that the Turques within ſhorte
ſpace poſſeſſed not only Pontho and Capadocia, but aſſailed
the leſſer Aſia (which takinge his name of thē is at
this daye called Turchia) in ſuch ſort, that in ſhort time
they became lordes, and maiſters of Galatia, Bithinia,
Pamphi

               ia, Piſidia, of the one and other Frigia, of Cilitia,
and of Caria, enlarging the cōfines of their dominion
euen from the sea called Ionio, to the banckes of the
ſea Egeo, and then appointed to euery faction and contrey,
hys gouernor, and in this ſorte gouerned for a long
time, hauing among them nother kinge, ne any man endued
with tytle of ſouereentie, other then of captaine, according
to the ſaying of Nicolao Sagundino a man very
well ſeen, bothe in the Greake and Latyne tonge, and

Ottomano, of a noble houſe and ſmale welthe, wyſe, and
of a noble minde, whoe by his perſwaſiones and towardneſſe,
had gathered togither a greate numbre of valiante
and lustie men, deſirouse of alteration, he toke in hand y•
which he knewe to be generally acceptable vnto thē, which
was to make warres againſt the chriſtianes which confyned
with his contreys, and throughe hys lyberal diſtributing
of the proies and ſpoiles that he gate from y• chriſtians,
to his ſouldiors, his power was ſo encreſed throwe
the pleaſantneſſe of gaine and reputacion that his people
had, that he (ſeing him ſelfe cheyfe of an armye whych deſired
to liue licenſiouſly, and was apte to accompanye him
in whatſoeuer enterpriſe he ſhoulde take in hand, determined
to make him ſelfe prince of that companye, and began
openly wyth warres to perſecute thoſe y• wolde not there
vnto agree in the which his enterpriſe, he was very well
holpen by the diſcorde and diuiſion that was amongeſt the
principall and cheife rulers of that nation, and he ayding
him ſelfe with the ſame diuiſiō, did continaully maintaine
and norriſhe the ſame, and gaue nowe ayde to the one partye

and then to the other,Subtillitie of Ottomā no the firſte prince of the turkes. vntyl that they were al, ſo conſumed
and impoueriſhed that they were not able to reſiſte
his force, when it was emploied againſt them. And in this
ſorte, he became a Tyran ouer his owne natyon, & made
him ſelfe lord of the greateſt part of their contreis namīg
him ſelfe prince of the leſſer Aſya. This Ottomano at his
death lefte to ſuccede hym in hys kyngdome Orcano hys
ſonne,Oreano the ſecond who folowing his fathers fote ſteppes did not only
preſerue the Empire which his father lefte him. But alſo
enlarged it greatly, when Orcano died, Amorath hys eldeſte
ſonne ſucceded him in his kingdome,Amorath the third. who trāſfering
his courte to Bithinia, ordained ye ſeate of hys kyngdome
in Burſia, which ſtandeth at the very fote of the rootes of
the Mounte Olimpo. In the time of Amorathe, two of the
Emperors ſonnes of conſtantinople fel at ſtryfe aboute ye
poſſeſſyon of the Empire, it ſemed to the yonger ſonne, y•
his brother did maruelously oppreſſe him, and althoughe
his force was not ſufficient to reſyſt hym, he woulde not
yet giue place vnto him, but ſent to Amorathe for ayde, of
fering him a great ſum of mony inrecompence, Amorathe
agreed to his demande, and aſſembled his power, and with
ſpede embarqued hys people and paſſed into Gretya, and
with greate ſubtiltye dyd leade the warres at length, and
when he ſawe the two bretherne ſo weake and that they
had conſumed the treaſure which their father left them, &
by their cyuille warres had ſo ſpoiled their contrey y• they
were not able to maintayne them ſelues in there eſtate wt

emploied his force againſt them both, and in ye firſte

for his ſtate, for aſmuche as it ſtandeth in Propontide
vpon the ſea ſide not farre from the mouth of ye ſtraite
of Heleſponto. And deſiring erneſtly in his minde the Empire
of Gretia for aſmuch as he knewe their force not able
to endure againſt him, wherupon he vſed the occaſyon, &

in ſhorte ſpace after, then the ſucceſſyon was wholly in
Baiazith who toke in hande the goueraunce. And whē he
had eſtabliſhed his ſtate in Aſya,Bayazithe the 4 prince of the turkes made the ſecond warres in Gretia. he ſent a new power into
Europa, and reuiued the warres began by his father, againſt
the Greekes, in the which fortune ſo fauored hym
that in ſhorte ſpace he was poſſeſſid of all Romania, and

after this he paſſed on and made his warres euen in the very
bowels of Gretia, with a courſe of maruelouſe victorie
no place reſiſting him, he occupied Theſſalia, Phocide, the
contre of Boetia, with the greateſt part of the contrey of
Attica, that onely the citie of Athenes was defendid, which
being of ſuche force, both natural and artificiall that it
was inexpugnable, wherfore he entred into Macedonia ye
which in time paſt had his confines greatly enlarged thorough
the great force of ye places of the ſame, & conteyned
in it at that time ye contreis of Peonia and Paphlagonia,
and finding it vnforniſhed of ſuch as moughte defended it
he poſſeſſyd it, and paſſed on with his people and made a
courſe through Boſſina, and Seruia, leadinge awaye wt
him continually great proies both of men, and catell in
moſt miſerable calamitie, and thus he went on conſuming
and deſtroing the contreis,Baiazith beſegithe. Conſtantinople. and then retorned into Romania,
and broughte his armie to conſtantinople, and ſhutte
in them of the cytye and toke from them, all the contrey
aboute them, in ſuch ſort y• they were enforced to hold thē
               
with in the gates of ye citie, and coulde non withoute great
danger go forth of it no way by land, & tormenting it continually,
had brought it to that paſſe that the Citizens being
out of all hope to defended it, began alredie, to practiſe
appointment with him. And there is no doute, that yf
god by extraordinarie meanes, had not prouided for it, the
citie of conſtantinopole ye which in time before, many hundred
yeres paſſed, had ben the hed, not onely of Gretia, but
alſo, of the greateſt part of the worlde, had at that tyme
fallen into hands of the moſt cruell and Barbarouſe natione
of Turques, had not ben Tamerlano, a parthian borne
who with a great power: entred ye leſſer Aſia, and aſſailed
it with ſuch furie, that he cōſtrened Baiazith to abandone
Conſtantinople: and to paſſe with his armie in to Aſya,
for the defence therof. And hauing nowe occaſion to ſpeke
of the actes of Tamerlano, and his people, I haue thought
it,Digre
                     ••••
                  
                not inconuenient, to make ſome litle digreſſyon, and to
declare from whence this puiſſant captaine had his original,
and by what meanes he dyd attayne to the hygh and
ſupreme degre of honor, in the which he then was,
when Baiazith was chiefe prince, and king of the Turkes,
thys Tamerlano was borne in Parthia, of baſe
and ſimple parents, he was exeriſed in armes euen from
his childehed, and did ſo profyte therin, that it was harde
to ſaye which had greater place in him, eyther ſtrength
and luſtines of his bodye or els his wiſdome and other vertues
of the minde, ſo that amonge the ſouldiors he was
had in great reputatyon and honor, in ſuch ſort that a
great multitude folowed him, and cheifely thoſe, which
were moſt experimented in the warres and thus in ſhorte
time he became prince of a mightye armie, both of horſe
men, & fotemen, whō he had gayned to folow him, by his
vertue, good dyſpoſytion, and lyberalytye, by whoſe aide
he fyrſte delyuered hys contrey of Parthya from the bondage
of the ſaracenes, and then became prince therof after
that wyth greate violence, he aſſailed the contreis
neare vnto hym and in fewe yeares poſſeſſyd them: and
broughte to his obedience, Scithia Aſyatyca, Iberia, the
Albaneſes, the Perſyanes, the Aſſyrianes, and Medes,
a
                  •
               d laſt of all he broughte vnder

his yoke Meſopotamia and the greater Armenia, and
then paſſed ouer the floode Euphrates aboute the yere of
our Lord 1390. with a farre greater army then was that
of Dario, or that which Xerſe broughte into Grecia, for
it is ſayde that he had in his campe 400000.The atmie of Tamer lano. horſemen, &
600000. fote men, with whom he aſſayled the leſſer Armia,
vpon whoſe confines Baiazith the Turke, king of Aſia
encountred him with a mightie power both of horſmen &
fote men, and truſting in the vertue and diſcipline of his
people, whoſe labour he had a long tyme vſed wt great
felicitie, did not refuſe to accepte the battayle notwithſtandyng
he knewe him ſelfe to be farre inferiour in number.
Then theſe two mightie princes approching the one
towardes the other ſo neare as they mighte diſcerne the
one the others order,The batel betwene tamerlano & baiazith. omitted no time but ioyned in battayle,
in the which, for the greateſt parte of the day there
were flayn great numbers on both ſydes, and thei fought
wyth ſuch aſſuraunce, nether parte geuynge place to the
other, that it was harde to ſaye where the victorie ſhould
incline, tyll at the laſt the Turkes beyng werye, and not
able to endure the force of the Parthians (who continually
ſupplied their ſquadrones with freſhe bandes) ſoughte
to retyre them ſelues in order, tightynge continually in
their retreicte, but the Prince beynge ware hereof, commaunded
certayne great troupes of horſemen to geue
charge vpon them, who charged them wyth ſuche force
that they diſordered them, and then the Turkes began
to flee, leauyng the victorie to theyr enemies, and Baiazith
fought valiantlye a longe tyme in perſon, tyll he had
loſt a great multitude of hys people: and alſo laſte of all,
his horſe was ſtayne vnder hym and then was taken and
preſented to Tamerlano, who commaunded him to be
encheined, and ledde him with him thorow out al Aſia for
a ſpectacle, and it is ſayde that whyleſt he did dine and
fuppe, he had him alwayes tyed vnder his table lyke a
dogge, and ſo fedde him, and when he went to horſe, he
cauſed him to be brought and to ſit him downe vpon his
knees & elbowes. And thus vſed him in ſtede of a block to
go to his horſe on. And thus he helde him priſoner during
his life in moſt miſerable calamitie.
            
               
All thoſe which at any time haue written of Tamerlano,Diſciplyne of Tamerlano.
haue greatlye commended hym for the diſcipline and
order which he obſerued in the conducting of his armyes,
for they declare that euery occupation had hys ſtreate appoynted
him in the campe, wherein he might vſe his exerciſe
euen in lyke order as it had bene in a famous citie, &
there was in it greate abundaunce of all thynges for the
commoditie of man, which proceded of hys ſeueritie and
iuſtice, for he woulde not leaue vnpuniſhed the ieaſt violence
that was committed: not ſo much as the takyng away
of one handful of graſſe agaynſt ye owners good wil
whereupon it folowed that he had as great abundance of
all neceſſaries in his campe, as if it had bene in great faires
and markettes, brought thither voluntarilie from the
countreys aboute him as he paſſed, his ſeueritie alſo was
ſuch that it helde hys Souldyours ſo wythin the bandes
of modeſtie, that there was neuer ſene nor head any
kynde of ſedicion amonge them, and they ſaye further,
which is greatlye to be merueyled at, that he neuer
fought with man, but he had the victorye ouer hym, ſo
that he neuer taſted of Fortunes bitternes. Thus when
he had ſpoyled and conquered all Aſia euen to the floode
Nilo, & had taken by force Emirua, Antiochia, Sebaſtia,
Tripoli, and Damaſco, with a greate number of other cities
moe, and put the inhabitantes of them to the ſworde
caried away theyr ſpoyle, and conſumed them into aſhes:
leauing them deſert and plained to the grounde.
            Then entred he into Egypte, where he gaue many ouerthrowes
to the Soldanes people, and conſtrained them to
flee beyonde Peluſyo and wolde haue folowed them hade
not the ſcarcenes of victuales ben, for it was not poſſyble
for him to prouide cariage for to tranſporte ſufficientie of
victual: for the norriſhing of ſo populouſe an armie as his
was, throughe the ſandie and deſerte contreis, his corrage
was ſuche, that he delighted cheifely in thoſe enterpryſes
which ſemed moſt difficile to be acheued in the opinion of
others,Damaſ
                     •
                  o. as it cam to paſſe in the taking of Damaſco, where
a numbre of the defendants conueyed them ſelues oute of
the towne into the caſtle where in there owne opynyon &
in the common opynyon of others, they were ſafe, conſyderyng

the naturall force of the ſeate, and alſo ye artificiſal
                  •
               
force of the place, notwithſtanding being deſyrouſe to auoide
the miſerie and trauaile of a ſege and to ſaue their
liues, they gaue out a token, ſignifiynge that they were
deſyrous to talke with him, and vpon condicion to yelde
him the place, but he refuſed vtterly to heare of any appoyntment,
although, his captaines woulde gladly haue
perſuaded him there vnto,Tameriano deliteth in difficile enterpriſes. but went and conſidered thorowly
the ſeate and force of the place, and ſeyng the walles
to be ſuch that no ladder might attayne the heyght of
them, he determn
                  •
               ed in any wiſe to haue it by force, wherupon
he cauſed forthwith neare vnto the ſame caſtel, another
caſtell to be buylded of farre greater heyght then the
firſt, from ye height wherof he did ſo beate his enemies day
and nyght without ceaſe, that in the ende with the loſſe
of a great number of his people, he toke it of force.
            After this, hauyng intelligence that in the citie of Caphia,
a gariſon towne of the Genoueſes,Pollicie of Tamer
                  
                     ••
                  o. was great ſtore
of golde and ſiluer in the handes of the marchantes, he
hauynge alreadye purpofed to take that towne by force,
which ſtandeth in Cheroneſſo Taurico, not far from the
Boſphono and ſtraite Timerico, and conſiderynge that
the treaſure (although he wanne the towne) mought eaſelye
be buried vnder the grounde and ſo ſaued, he determined
to haue both the towne & treaſure by this meane,
he called to him the ſkynners of his countrey, ſuch as had
moſt riche furres, as Sables, Armines, Genettes, Martirones,
and ſuche lyke, and gane them commaundement,
for the more ſpedie diſpatche of ye matter, that they ſhulde
not paſſe, for the ſellyng of them at a lowe price, to the
ende, that through the meaneſſe of the price, the marchantes
mought more gredily by them, this matter beyng ſkilfully
handlded was ſone diſpatched, and immedialy after
that he denounced warres agaynſt them, and forthwith,
preſented him ſelfe with his armie to the towne, and
when he had enuironed the towne wyth his campe, he
planted his batteries and continued them day and nyght
without ceaſing, in ſuch ſort, that in ſhort ſpace he poſſeſſed
the towne, the marchantes, the furres, and the money
which was an ineſtimable treaſure. It is written alſo,

that this was his ordre in beſeeging of townes, ye fyrſt
daye his owne lodgings were white, and if in that day,
the inhabitants of the towne dyd yelde vnto him,The cuſtum of Tamerlano in the beſeeging of townes. they
receuid no hurte nother in body nor goodes, the ſeconde
daye his lodgings were red, which ſignifyed to them of
the towne that yf then they yelded, that he wolde put
to death all the maſters of the families. And the thyrde
day, was his laſt change, which was in to blacke Pauillions
and tentes, and then refuſed he all appointments
and when he had in this ſorte taken any Citie or towne
he put all that were in it to the ſworde, not ſparing any
of whatſoeuer age or kinde they were, when he had thus
done, then wolde he commaunde to ſack the towne, and
when the goodes were taken oute of it, then wolde he
cauſe fyre to be ſet in the towne & ſo conſume it to aſhes
& leue it deſerte. And there is a bruite which cōtinueth
euen to this daye in thoſe partes, that on a tyme a certaine
populouſe citie defended them ſelues, tyll the third
day, and then ſeing a great ſpace of the walle laid flatte
on the earth, and the enemie in battaile redie to gyue y•
aſſaulte they were diſcoraged, and thincking to pacifie y•
wrath of this cruel, proude, aud victoriouſe enemie, by
humblyng them ſelues, ſent forth all the wemen and
chyldren of the towne in white clothynge: wyth oliue
branches in their hands, offeringe him the towne, calling
to him with lowde voice for mercy, whom whē Tamerlano
ſawe a farre of comming toward him,great crueltie of Tamerlano. he gaue
commaundement to certaine bands of his horſemen to
charge vpon them and to put them all to the ſworde, after
this, he toke the citie and ſacqued it, and then burned
it, it happened at that time by meanes of traffique of
marchaundeze, certaine marchante, a Genoueſe borne
to be greatly in fauor with Tamerlano, and being with
him at that ſame preſent diſcourſing of ſōdrie matters,
aſked him why he vſed ſo great crueltie towardes thoſe
people which he ouercame, but he torned to him with an
exceding troublouſe contenance: with eyes flaming like
fyre, and ſaid vnto him yf thou doſte thincke that I am
aman thou arte much deceuid, for I ſaye to the that I

receue due punniſhement for thy auditiouſe and foliſhe
demaunde, that thou gette the hence, out of my ſight, &
that thou comme leſſe in my preſence, the pore marchāt
being much feared with the words of the Tyran departed
from him & was neuer ſene after that by him, they
that haue ſen Tamerlano liuing,Tamerlano lykned to Aniball. haue ſaid that he reſembled
much both in face, and maners, Anibal of Carthage,
acordinge to the opinion of diurſe ancient wryters,
and before all other offenſes he ſhewed his ſeuere
Iuſtice againſte thefts, in punniſhing thē moſt ſharply
 wtout any remiſſion. And it is thought that he dyd it to
that ende, that the feare of punniſhement ſhoulde cauſe
them to refraine, to ye ende that he alone mought robbe
and ſpoile acording to his owne deſire the whole world
and laſt of all, his delighte was wholly ſet to gouerne,
in ſo much that he emploied him, ſelfe continually as in
an exerciſe moſt vertuouſe, to moleſt and trouble other
princes with warres, by the which he had ſubdued many
kings, and vtterly impoueriſhed a greate numbre of
tyranes, made deſerte many, contreis, and conuerted in
to aſhes an infinite numbre of cities and townes, & then
laſt of al, he retorned into his contrey with his army in
credibly enriched with the ſpoyle of thoſe natyons whō
he had ſubdued, and alſo he vſed to take oute of euerye
towne that yeldyed vnto him, certaine of the cheife houſholdes
with all their ſubſtances and riches, and to ſende
thē wholly in to Parthia. When he was retorned home
he builded a newe Citie very bewtifull, and of a greate
circuite, and placed their in all thoſe houſholds afore reherſed,
in ſo much, ye the newe Cytie beinge inhabyted
wt theſe riche & noble men of diuerſe nationes, in ſhorte
tyme increaſed ſo in welth, that yt became the cheife citie
of all the Orient. And yf it had happened, that Tamerlano
had had with him ſome man of excellent learning
and wyſedome, who mought wt his writings haue
celebrated the great enterpriſes that he dyd, their is no
doute but that he mought, haue ben numbred amonge
the cheife and princypall captaynes, eyther of the olde
worlde orels of this preſent age, but god gyueth not all

things to one man, & alſo it ſemed that his great crueltye
which he vſed towarde thoſe y• he ouercame, dyd not
deſerue to haue his fame celebrated by writing, ne yet
ye it mought long remaine to his poſteritie, when Tamerlano
died, he lefteto ſuccide him in his Empire whiche

the Empire whiche once was his fathers & after
that retorned into his ſtate & gouernement in Gretia, &
from thence went againſt ye king of hungari, who went
then for aide to Charles the vi. Kinge of Fraunce, who
graunted him a greate numbre of men at armies vnder
the conducte and guide of Iohn Counte of Niuerſe, who
afterwarde ſuccyded his father in the gouernance and
principalitie, of the Duchie of Borgonie, and of many other
Captaines as it is ſome thing plainely declared alredye

not only of his kingdome but alſo of his life, but he
long enioyed not that kingdom ſo wickedly gotten, but
died in ſhorte ſpace after,Mahometh the 7 kinge. & lefte his brother Mahometh
to ſuccede in his place, who afterwarde made warres
vpon the people of Valachia, a ſtoute nation, dwelling
neare the mouth of the ryuer Danubio, giuīg them many
ouerthroes, and conſuming their contrey with continuall
courſes and ſpoiles, compelled them to ſearch appointment
and to giue trybute, after all this he emploied
his force againſt certaine noble men of the Turkiſhe
nation, which dwelled in Aſya, and he fell to agrement
with ſome of them, and the greateſt numbre of them he
baniſhed from their contreys and dominions, and toke
them cleane from them. This Mahometh duryng hys
raigne, handled the chriſtians that were hys ſubiects very
cruelly, and dyd plague them with ſondrye tyranies,
whē Mahometh died, he left his Kingdome, to Amorath

came with all ſpede of Calcedone to paſſe ye ſtraite
and ſo to entre into his dominions of Gretia, but the
Emperor of Conſtantinople: dyd prohibite him the paſſage
for a long ſeaſon with his nauie, and ſet Muſtaffa

Muſtaffa, and Amorath were once ioyned in battayll,
Muſtaffa with his power was ſone defeicted, & Amorath
with his armie remained there with the victorie vpon ye
place, and eaſyly poſſeſſid the dominions and kingdome
of his father, after that he brought his armie into Gretia,
and with continuall courſes dyd ſo ſpoyle and impoueriſhe,
thoſe prouinces that yet reſted in the handes
of the chriſtians, and lad his armie to the citie Theſalonica,
which was then poſſeſſyd by the Venetyanes, by
vertue of a graunt made vnto them by Theodoro, ſon to
Emanuell, Emperor of Conſtantinople, and toke it by
force and ſacked it, and lefte it in maner deſerte, and
folowing on, the race of his victorie, entred in to Epirro

which of men of this age is called Lartha, & frō thence
into the contreis of the people called Etolli, contreis in
ancient time of great power and nobilitie, and at thys
daye are ioyned to the gouernance of Macedonia,Amorathe taketh Sckyauonia. & whē
he had thus taken them, he annexed them to his crown.
And ſhortly after he entred into Illiria, whiche at thys
daye is called Schiauonia, in ye which their is contained
Dalmatya, Croacya, and Iſtria, with the people called
Iburni, he ouer ran it with exceding great ſpoile and deſtruction
therof, alſo he toke there certaine townes, and
caried awaye from thence an ineſtimable proye of men
and catel. And bycauſe among the Turkes it was lawful
for one mā to haue many wiues,Amorathe taketh to wife the daughter of the diſpotte of Seruia. Amorath although
he had alredie a great nūber of wiues yet he ioyned him
ſelfe in mariage with a daughter of George Diſpotto of
Seruia, but making ſmal acompte of ye band of affinitie
with in ſhort ſpace after, he entred into Seruia as an enemie
with his armie, but George knowing his force not
ſufficient to reſiſte the power and furie of his ſonne in
lawe furniſhed with men & monition, the citie of Sinderonia,
and left in it one of his ſonnes for the defence
therof, and he, with his wife children and familie fled in
to Hungarie, and caryed wyth hym a greate numbre of
preſtes,Seruia taken by Amorath
                     •
                  
                Amorath in a ſhorte time became lord of al Seruia,
& then laſte of all with his armie went to Sinderonia,
and toke it by force, and finding in it the ſonne of ye
diſpotto, he plucked out both his eies, & caried him priſoner
with him, when George had thus loſte his contrey
he continued in hungarie many yeres in exile, tell on a
time Iohn the vaiuoda, which then gouerned hungarie
entred īto Saruia. This vaiuoda was acompted for his
great Iudgement in warres, one of ye moſt famouſe captaines
of Europe, and had giuen to diuers of the Turkes
Sauigiachi, many ouerthroes, and recouerid out of
the hands of the ſaid Turke, a great parte of the contre
of the afore named Diſpotto, but he reſtored him not to
all that which he had recoueryd,lyberalitye of Vauioda. for ſome parte of it he
gaue to his captaines, other he helde to him ſelfe, perſwading
him ſelfe that he had great reaſon ſo to doe, cō
               ſidering
that it was he that had recoueryd it, and therfore

thought it good to holde ſome part of it for him ſelf
and ſome for his frinds, and the rather for that he knew
the diſpotto, not worthye to be truſted, for ſo much as
as he put no difference betwene the Chriſtian relygyon,
and the Mahometan, and for that hys contrey laye betwene
the hungarianes and ye Turks, and wolde nowe
enter in league with the one, and then with the other,
and deceaue them both, but nowe retorning to ſpeke of
Amorath, a man truely of great power, & alſo of greate
vnderſtanding in warres, who when he had brought vnder
fote thoſe noble men of his nation, that helde anye
parcell of his dominion, and had reduced to his obedyence,
all the leſſe Aſia, with pontho and Capadotia, ſo
that all thoſe that dwellid in it were his excepte onely

in Armenia neare to the floode & uphrates, and the
lord of Scandalaro which far beionde the citie of Setalia,
doth poſſeſſe that part of Cilicia that doth face the
Iſte of Cipres, and although that Amorath had determined
in his minde ye enterpriſe againſt ye hungarianes
yet he thought it good to make him ſelfe lord of ye reſt of
Gretia,the, ſeat of Peloneſſo or at ye leaſte to leaue them, his frynds, at hys
backe, wherupon he entred into Peloponeſſo which at
this daye is called morea, and from thence marched
on with his armies, to ye ſtraite (which beig) in breddeth
but fiue thouſād paſes doth deuide Peloponeſſo frō
the reſt of Gretia, in ſorte, that if this diſtraite of ye land
were cut through, Peloponeſſo ſhold be & Iſle, enufroned
wt y• ſeas, Egeo, and Ionio) & there raſed ye walle of
Eſmillia ye which in tim paſte was made by the Greekes
for a ſtrengeth to their contre, & Cōſtantainte ye diſpotto
who at that time poſſeſſed it ſeing him ſelfe not able
to defend it, dyd groe to an appointment with him,
and agred to giue him a certaine tribute, and by that
meanes made peace with him. When Amorathe had
thus broughte to paſſe the affares of Peloponeſſo, and
poſſeſſid the whole prouince of Attica and was agreed
with the lord of the citie of Athenes which was aflorin
tine by Birth, he aſſembled an armie of a hundred thouſands
of men, and ſo paſſed into hungarie, & being there

coulde by no meanes get,Amorathe paſſethe with his armie into Hungarye ſufficencie of corne ne victuales,
for ſuch an armie, for ſo much, as ye yere before there
had fallē ſo much raine ī hungarie, ye it had in maner vtterly
diſtroied their corne, in ſo much that ye inhabitāts
therof, were enforced to leaue ye cōtery in manye places
therof & to ſeke for reliefe in other places, ye which whē
he conſidered, he cōmaūded to ſpoyle the contrey, as
much as in thē was, & thē retorned home wt his armie.
This ſcarcety & wante of victual did at ye time ſaue the
kingdome of Hungarie, for by meanes of it, Amorath
was cōſtrained to retorne home wt his armie, & to cōtēt
thē ſelues wt ye ſimple ſpoile ye they there found.the Cardinal Saint Agnolo ſent into Almaigne Thē Eugenio
ye forth of ye name Buſhope of Rome, vnderſtādig
in what peril ye cōtrey of Hūgari was, ſent in to Almany
Iuliano Ceſearino his legate dalatere, Cardinall S.
Agnolo, to perſwad ye Emperour and other princes of ye
almanigne nation to ayde the king of Hūgari, which
Ceſarino when he cam into Almagnie, did earneſtly deſire
ye Emperour to take vpon him ye defence of ye Kingdom
of Hungarie, againſt ye enemies of ye Chriſtiā faith
when he had thus done, he wente into Hungarie, and
there by his auctoritie & effectuous perſuaſion, ſo moued
ye people, ye euery man toke his furniture & weapon
& wolde not tarye, ye aide ye was promyſed thē out of Almaigne,
but folowed Iohn Vaiuoda their captayne, &
marched on into Gretia, vntill they came to the citie
of Sophia, & hauinge often times occaſiō to deale wt the
Turkes, had alwayes ye victorie of thē Vaiuoda wanne
ſo great eſtimatiō in this iourney, in ye which he did not
onely fully execute ye office & dutie of an excellēt diſcret
Captaine, but alſo of a valiaūt and hardie ſouldiour, ſo
that it was growen to a Prouerbe amonge ye Turkes,
ye whē ye mothers woulde appeaſe their chyldren from
crying, or els wt drawe them frō any fonde deſyre ye they
had, they would ſay, here cōmeth Vaiuoda. After this
all ye Sangiachi gatherid thē ſelues together, wt ye Lieu
tenaunt of Gretia, which in ye Turkiſhe ſpeche is called
Belagarbei, & they vnited theyr powers & marched toward
the chriſtians, wt a very puyſaunt armye, bothe of
horſe men and foote men, and ioyned wyth theym

in battaile,Battaile betwen vaiuoda and the belagarbei of gretia. but the Chriſtians in numbre, were farre in
feriour to the infidels, who fought for a longe time verye
valiantly with the hungarianes, but at the laſte being
ouercomme, through the vertue, and diſcipline of ye
hungarianes torned their backes and flied, and in thys
flight were flaine a great numbre of them. In this acte
ofarmies, ye hungarian Captaines did ſome what augment
the victorie, and wrote to frederick the Emperour
declaring that they had defeicted the turkiſhe armie, and
ſlaine thritye thouſand of them vpon the place, and alſo
taken of them a greate numbre, but it ſemeth to me rather
that to be true, that the Cardinall Sainte Agnolo
wrote to the pope and the Emperour, which was, that
the number of them y• were ſlaine, was vpon the pointe
of ſyre thouſand, and that alſo, they had takē ix. cornets
of the enemies, and thus attributing the glory to God:
and then to Iohn the Vaiuoda, whoſe great vnderſtanding,
and magnanimitie, he doth celebrate with maruelouſe
praiſes, when the turkes were retorned home frō
this defeicte,Brute in Turchie thei were more afraied them hurt, by meanes
of a brute that ran among them, that the hungarianes
dyd not onely make preparation to inuade them,
but the Almaignes and all the princes of Chriſtendome
alſo, wherupō they being in great doute and feare, ſent
to the hungarianes for peace, who well weing ye power
of ye enemye, imputed the victorie as well to good happe
as to their force, and were willing to auoide the danger
of anye more enhaxarding their force, to attempte fortune,
whereupon with good wil accepted the conditiones
offeryd vnto them, and in this ſorte aſtabliſhed a treues
betwine them for ten yeres, conditionally ye they ſhoulde
reſtore againe to ye Diſpotto of Seruia, all ſuch townes
of his,Trewes betwene the hungers & the Turckes. as they then helde preſently in their poſſeſſyon,
when ye agrement, was thus put in writing, them were
they on both partes ſolempnely ſworne, to obſerue and
fulfill all ſuch articles as were notified with in the ſaid
treues, and thus on both ſydes they ceaſſed from hoſti,
litie, diſolued their armies, and eyther retorned to hys
contrey. The Cardinall who had determyned to leuye
a newe armie, and ſo to folowe the victorye, was verye

muche diſpleaſed with the makyng of this trewes, and
wrote his minde to the Pope in that behalfe,Note the cōmaundemēt of the Pope. who was
very ſorowfull when he harde of it, and beynge a man
fully bent to chaſe the Infidels out of Europe, wrote agayne
to hys Legate: that the trewes taken betwene
the Hungarians and the Turkes, was of no value: for
ſo much as his conſent was not in it, and therefore charged
him to commaunde Laodiſlao, Kynge of Polonia:
who at that tyme poſſeſſed Hungarie, that he ſhoulde
breake the trewes made with the enemie, and reuyue
the warres, for ſo much as he and the reſt were diſpenſed
with as touchynge theyr othe, by the authoritie of
the Apoſtolike ſeate, then the biſhop ſent forth hys Legates
to the reſt of the Chriſtian princes deſyring them
to ayde the Kyng of Hungarie in this enterpriſe againſt
the Turke for the recouerye of Gretia, but he founde
none that was any 
                  •

of Camertingo his nephewe, to the ende that they
ſhoulde ſpoyle and inuade the coaſte of Aſia, & to ſhutte
vp the ſtraite, that no ayde ſhoulde come out of Aſia into
Europe. When Laodiſlao had receyued this commaundement
of the great biſhop, he thought it very fit
for his purpoſe, for ſo muche as he knewe ryghte well
that the nobilitie of Hungarie were not well contented
that he ſhould gouerne and poſſeſſe their countrey,
wherefore he thought it good to holde the people thereof
continually occupyed in warres. And immediatlye
without anye difficutie obeyed the popes commaundement,
ſent for men into Polonia and Bohemia, with other
countreys neare about him, and leuyed his armye,
made him readie with great celeritie, leading with him
a great number of Hungararians and alſo in maner, all
the nobilitie and Prelates of Hungarie, he had alſo in
his companye the Cardinall of ſainct Agnolo, who by
the authoritie of the Apoſtolike ſeate had gathered together
a great number of croſſed men, when Laodiſiao

was proclamed Captaine generall of the iorney (Iohn
vainoda went with an armie,An other iorney againſt the Turcks. in the which it is written
that there were xl. thouſand horſemen beſides fotemen)
towards Valachia, where he had paſſage and victuall, &
then paſſed ouer the plaines, and after that, ouer the ryuer
Dauubio, and from thence marched on into the lower
Miſia which at this preſent is called Burgaria,Myſya nowe called Burgaria. intending
to paſſe through ye plaines into Romania with
his armie, when Amorathe vnderſtode the commyng of
the Chriſtians, and the great power that they were of,
he truſted not greatly to the Greks, ne yet to ye Turcks
that were brought vp in Gretiae, but thought it good to
prouide him an armie of the people of Aſia, wherwith he
was maruelouſly troubled, conſidering the difficultie in
paſſing them into Gretia, for ſo muche as the nauye of
the Chriſtians laye all along the Coaſtes, waiting continually
to empeche him that he mought paſſe no armie
oute of Aſia to Europe, and thus toſſing and tormen
ting him ſelfe, ſerching what waye he mought deuiſe to
paſſe them, being almoſt deſperate and oute of hope, of
any tranſportage for them, conſyderyng the difficultye
therof, it is ſaide that he was deliuered from this care by
meanes of an offer that was made vnto him, by certaine
maſters of Shippes of Genoba, which went to him and
offered hym, that yf he wolde contente them well, that
they wolde paſſe him in to Europe what numbre of mē
he wolde, and wolde giue him ſuertie therof, of the which
offer he was exceding glade, and agred to giue them
for euery man that they ſhold paſſe that ſerued on horſe

for that they were more in numbre then they were bruited
to be, orels it happened: as often times it both, that
to thoſe that are affraied of euery ſhadow, ſmale things

by meanes of the preſent peryl, and chaunged opinion,
and began to perſwade the king, not to accepte the battaile,
but ye he ſhuld do wel, to march away to ſome place
of aduantage, vnto whom the king anſwered that his
councel was giuen out of time, for ſo much as he ſawe it
to be more daūgerouſe to turne their backs ye enemy being
ſo neare then to make good the place, and to accepte
the battaile, for in giuing battaile, they had great reaſō
to hope for the victorie, conſyderinge it hath bene often
ſeen that the leſſer armie hath defeicted the greater, and
alſo that in giuing battaile, the vertue and diſcipline of

I can not certenlye ſaye, but yt the ſlaughter & ſpoyle of
the Turkes, did farre exceade that of the Chriſtians,
but cōſiderynge ye inequalitie of the armies, the loſſe of
the Chriſtians (weyng their number) did farre excede
that of the Turkes.
            When Amorathe had thus obtained the victorie and
reſted wholly maiſter of the fielde, he had no great deſire
to folow the chaſe of his fliyng enemies, nor yet did glorie
wyth great wordes as the maner of the Turkes is,
ne yet ſought in any kynde of ſort to amplifie the victorie:
nor ſhewed in his cōntenaunce anye kinde of ioye,
and being demaunded by certayne of his familiers: the
cauſe,Anſwer of Amorathe. that after ſo great a victorie, he ſhewed him ſelfe
ſo melancolicke, he anſwered, I deſyre not often to obtayne
victorie in this ſorte. After this, he rayſed hys
canipe and deſolued it, and ſuche ſouldiours as he had
lefte aliue, he ſent agayne to the places from whenre
they came, and he in perſon retourned to Andrinople,
wher he accompliſhed ſundrie vowes that he had made
to God.A notable conſideration of an heathen prince. And after thys, he called to mynde the great
peryl and danger that he had bene in, and alſo the great
cares that are incident to gouernement, in the whiche
he concluded that no man mought call him ſelfe happy,
for as much as it hath in it, more of the bitter, then
of the ſwete, and iudging alſo by examples paſſed:
the inconſtantie of Fortune, who rarely accompanieth
anye man fauourablie throughoute to the ende, and beyng
deſirous to prouide for his ſecuritie, and quietnes,
called to hym all hys Baſcias and chyefe gouernours
and councellours, of his Empire, and by theyr conſent
appoynted in his ſtede, Mahometh his eldeſt ſonne to be
their prince and lord, and to be gouerned vntyll he came
to lawfull age to gouerne, by Calibaſſo Baſcia, who
for his power and wiſedome,Amorathe in priuate eſtate. was the chiefe counſeller
that the Turke had, and when he had diſburdened him
ſelfe of gouernement and was become priuate, he paſſed
ouer into Aſia, accompanied wt certen of his familier
frendes,Mahometh the 9. prince. and there lyued religiouſlye geuynge him ſelfe
to ſolitarine. Al hys ſonnes, Mahometh only excepted,
were by ye aduyſe of the Baſcias put to death, to auoide

all occaſions of tumultes ſturres and alteracions that
mought happen,The turkiſhe coſtume. as often times it doth among the Turkiſhe
nation, with whom the children of priuate mē are
more happie, then they of Emperours, the battayle of
Varna, did ſo diminiſhe and conſume the force, of bothe
the Tukes and Hungerianes, that withoute any conuenante
of peace at all, they helde them of bothe ſydes
with in the frontiers of of their contreis for the ſpace of
many yeres after,victorie, dearly bought and neyther of them durſte to enter
the others contrey, ne yet to prouoke by anye maner
of iniurie, the one the other to warres, thys quietnes
was ſo much the more perfecte, for ſomuch that neither
in Turchia: ne yet in Hungaria, was there any king of
age, able to gouerne him ſelfe, but ether of them, were
gouerned by other men, for among the Turkes dyd Callibaſſo
gouerne, and among the Hungarianes dyd Iohn
Vaiuoda, gouerne, both, men of great reputacyon and
credite among their owne people, Calibaſſo had gouerned
a long time vnder Amorathe, and being a man very
graue and modeſte hauing alſo greate experience, was
Iudged of al men a very wiſe man, Vaiuoda being a mā
of a percinge Iudgement,Opiniō of Vaiuoda. and valiannt in warres, was
holden in the opinion of all men to be the more ſkylfull
of both, it ſemid to him that he had loſte great reputaci
on by ye ouerthrow receaued at Varna, which dyd much
diſquiet him wherfore he deniſed in hym ſelfe daye and
night, howe to recouer his loſte credite, and to be reuenged
of the diſhonour that he had receaued, he iugged the
quiet being of the Turcks (who are ambitiouſe and deſire
to enlarge their dominions) to procede only of want
of gouernance and force, wherupon he thought to preuent
them & to aſſaile them vnloked for, and althoughe
he knewe well that they were able to leuye a great power,
yet he perſwaded him ſelfe that they had no gouernor
able to commaunde, and alſo he was not ignorante
that a great armie inobedient, and wanting a diſcrete
leadre, was leſſe to be feared, then a wiſe and experimented
Captaine with oute an armie, wherupon he determyned
to make warres againe againſt the Turcks wt 
all ſpede, and with grea deligence aſſembled his people

of Hungaria and Bohemia, he entretained in paie alſo:
diuerſe regiments of Almaignes and other ſtrangers
fote men, and ſo marched on towarde the Turkes with
his armie, thincking to entre their contre and to take
ſome place of importance with in the contrey and ſo to
paſſe one with his armie to Andrinople, before the enemie
ſholde vnderſtand of his departure out of Hungarie
which he was like to haue done,Treaſon of Diſpot to. had not the fylthie treaſon
of George diſpotto ben, whoe as ſone as he harde y•
Vaiuoda leuied bandes in Hungarye, he ſent to Calibaſſo
Baſcia, and to all the Sangiachii of Gretia, making
the numbre of the Chriſtians far greater then in
dede it was, reporting the matter to be more perillous
then of it ſelfe it was, which whē they vnderſtode: they
were ſo amaſed, that they knewe not whither to torne
them, for they were oute of al hope that Amorath wolde
euer ſtand them in any ſtede, for ſo much as he was olde
and had giuen ouer all charge and wholly giuen him to
religion, wherfore he wolde no more deale in warres,
and for that Mahometh was ſo yonge, they thoughte it
not good to commytte ſo weightie a matter in to hys
hands, as the leadyg of an armie againſt ſo puiſſant, &
ſkylfull an enemye as Vaiuoda was, and they feared
that if Calibaſſo ſhoulde leade their armye, he ſhoulde
not haue due obedience, which is a thinge moſte perillous
in all armyes. Thus, when the councell had debated
ſondrie opinions, they agred vpon none, but were
in great confuſion, conſuming the time in diſcourſes of
none effect growing to no point at all, at the laſt by the
aduiſe of Calibaſſo, here was their onely remedie, they
agreed to call Amorath oute of Aſia, and to enforce him
to come, yf that with good wil: he wold not take in hand
the enterpriſe for the defence of his ſonnes ſtate, beinge
aſſured at that time that the Gianizzeries wolde fighte
vnder rhe conducte of none but only of Amorathe, and
alſo they thought it not conuenient to committe the fortune
of the warres into the hands of anye man, Amoonly
exceptedvnder,Ambition of Mahometh. whoſe conducte they were alwaies
accuſtomed to embrace victory, this councell of Callibaſſo
very much diſplayſed the yonge king Mahomethe

whoe aboue all other thinges deſyred to haue gouerned
that iorney, to get him reputacien, and to giue them to
vnderſtand, that he was ſufficient to gouerne of hym
ſlfe, moreouer he ſuſpected that yf Amorathe wc
                  ••
                called
againe to gouerne, he moughte continewe in the
ſame, for ſo muche as the myndes of men are mutable.
When the ambaſſſadours were come into the preſence
of Amorathe, they perſwaded him erneſtly to the iourney,
broughte hym wyth them to Andrinople, where
with great diligence: he aſſembled his ſouldiours and
furniſhed them of al kinde of neceſſaries. In this meane
tyme, was Vaiuoda come on toward Sophia, and encamped
at a place called Baſylia where it was declared
vnto him that Amorath was not farre of with the Turkiſhe
power,Beſilia where the battayle was foughte. whiche when he vnderſtode (althoughe it
were contrarye to his expertacion) cauſed hym to put
on a noble mynde determyninge not to tarie there the
comming of the enemye, but to march on towarde him
and ſo to encountre with him, as ſone as Vaiuoda had
diſcouered him forthe with he put his men in battayle
and marched on towarde him & with ſpede ioyned with
him in battayle, their began a terrible fyght which contynued,
y• ſpace of certaine houres with great obſtinatie
on both partes, that nether, gaue to the othe, one fote
of grounde the battayle was ſo doublefull, that of neyther
ſyde was there ſeene any aduantage,Note the place of the general of the armie. for againſte
that corner, or wingne of the battayle, wherein Vaiuo
da was, the Turckes were not able to endure the force
of the Hungarianes, and for a longe tyme gaue place
gyuing ouer the victorye in to the handes of their enemyes.
And in contrary wiſe, wheare Amorath was in
perſon, the Hungaianes were not able to make good
the place, after this, Vaiuoda and Amorathe mette
face to face, and drewe vnto them, all the whole weight
of the battayle, in ſo much y• the Chriſtians were not a
ble to endure y• great force of y• Turks, although y• Hungarians
did farre excide y• Turks, in vertue & diſcipline
of the wars yet not wt ſtanding, being ouer laid wt nūbre
and not with force, but being vtterly weried, were conſtrayned
to giue place, and Vaiuoda coulde nether with

praier, nor threating, cauſe them to make hed but fled
continually, wherupon he with drewe him, with a fewe
of his truſtie fryndes with him very ſkylfully from the
vattaile and ſo ſaued hym ſelfe, there dyed in that battayle
many noble men cheifely of the Hungariane nation
and ſome prelatz, y•. fote men were in maner all ſlaine
vpon the place, and on the Turckes part the loſſe was
not leſſe when he came to his reuewe, when Amorathe
had thus (with the great effuſion of the blood of his people)
bought the victorie, he retorned home againe wyth
his armie,Amorathe reſtoreth Mahomth againe to gouernement. and reſtored his ſonne Mahometh againe to
his place, and continuing in his firſte purpoſe conueied
him ſelfe to Burſia, and there liued priuatly euen to his
death, in the which he committed to the faith of Callibaſſo
a yong ſonne of his, of the age of ſyxe Monethes,
which he begat of Spōderbei, a noble princes in Penderacia,
the childs name was Calapino, when he had thus
done, he died, & was buried ī Burſia, in ye prouince of Bithinia,
which was then the ſeate of the kingdome of the
houſe of Ottomanno, Calibaſſo being deſirous to gratitifie
the newe kinge deliuered into his hand the child of
Amorathe,vnſpeake able cruelti of Mahomethe. with the mother therof alſo, whereupon he
commaunded the chylde to be ſtrāgled and when it was
done he reſtored the dead body to his mother, and commaunded
to celebrate his funerales with princelye honour,
in this ſort dyd he conſecrate the beginning of his
raigne, wt the death of his innoocent brother, not wythſtanding,
ſomme are of opinion y• Calidaſſo dyd chaunge
the child and preſented an other in his place, and that y•
frewe childe was brought vppe in Conſtantinople, and
after ward ſent to Veniſe, and that it was he, that was
holden priſoner in the palace at Rome by Calixto y• biſhope,
but we refarre the trouthe of this matter to the
Iudgement of other, for we wyll affyrme nothinge in
this behalfe, but men may wel thincke that ſomtime or
it doth happen the ſonne of a Barbor, or of a Surgion,

happie was he, y• coulde be in the beſte order furniſhed,
there was not one of them but that he faſted all the

whole day tyll night that they ſawe the ſtarres appeare
in the heauenes, then euery man prepared hym to eate,

and made great chere togither, and when the had thus
in banquetting conſumed a good pece of the night, they
toke thir leue the one of the other, with embracing and
kiſſing one an other, as thoughe thei ſhulde neuer haue

vnderſtode the proclamatiō that this mighty prnice had
made and the great preparation alſo, y• preſts and other
religiouſe toke in hand the Images of the Crucifixe and
our Ladye, and alſo the reliques of Saincts and went in
ſolempne proceſſion with all the inhabitants of the Citie
ſinging of himnes and ſongs with ſheding of teares
calling to god for aide, in this ſort dyd they conſume all
that daye in faſting, praier, and viſiting the holly places
of the Citie vntyl night came, and then they made good
chere, and that done, euery man wente to the place that
he had in charge to defend, the walles of the Citie were
in heighte and thicknes, comparable to the walls of any
Citie, that then was in the worlde, but throughe their
long contynuance,Great negligence of the Greks and neglygence of the Greekes for
wante of reparation: their vauntemures were vtterlye
decaied in many places, but the walle was very ſtronge
and of ſufficient force to be defended, wherupon the Grekes
hauyng good hope in the force of theyr walles appointed
their people in companies for y• defence of thē.
Conſtantinople is in forme almoſte treangle, wherof,
the two partes that the ſea beateth on, are guirded aboute
with walles ſufficiently ſtronge to defend y• force
of the Armata, the reſte of the Citie, toward the firme
land, beſyde his walle wherof we haue alredye ſpoken,
is enuironned with a dyke, deye and large, when the
thirde watch of the night was paſſed, the Turckes beinge
very gredye vpon the ſpoyle of the Citie, made
them redye to the aſſaulte and woulde not tarye for the
daye lighte but preſented them ſelues to the walles of
the towne and began to aſſayle it,The firſte aſſaulte. from whence che arroes
and ſtones flewe as thycke as hayle from the heighte
of the walles, the Turckes were muche anoyed by

meanes of the darkenes for that they could not ſee how
to defende them ſelues from the arrowes and ſtones,
where with manye of them were ſlaine and hurt, when
it was perfit day, Mahometh approched neare ye towne
with al his power,Great iudgement of mahometh & commaunded when he ſhould geue
a ſigne, the towne to be aſſayled rounde, to the end that
they of the towns ſhould not be able to defende euerye
where his force, he appointed to euerye colonell wyth
his regiment a certaine ſpace of the wall to aſſayle, for
that they ſhuld fight apart, to the end the vertue of the
aſſaylants, and their worthy actes mought be ſene, &
that thereby they moughte be the more enflamed thorough
deſyre of honour to committe them ſelues to all
kinde of peryll. In like ſorte was their order geuen to
them of the Armata, with commaundement that in one
inſtant euery man ſhould aſſayle that place wherevnto
he was appoynted, there were broughte alſo nere to the
walles certaine towres of woode, which were ſet vpon
high groundes of aduauntage, vpon the which he placed
many ſouldiours, to the end thei mought with their
ſhot, bete a longe all the circuite of the walles, he had
alſo with his artillery, taken away all the defenſes, ſo
that when they ſhould come to defende the breache and
walles, they muſt ſtande all open againſt his ſhotte.
When Mahometh had done all theſe thynges, the token
of the aſſault was geuen, with the ſound of trumpettes,
bornes, bagpipes, and drummes, that the ayre
reſounded of it, immediatly herevpon the aſſault began
the Turkes couered thir heades with roundels & targes,
in ſuch ſort that it was like the rofe of an houſe ouer
their heads, & in this ſort came to y• walles, & ſet vp
theyr ladders,The ſecōd aſſaulte. enforſyng themſelues with great corage
to clyme to the height of the walles, on the other ſyde,
they of the towne endeuoured them ſelues to defende it
and threwe downe vpon them greate ſtones, myghtye
pieces of tymber, and annoyed them merueylouſlye
wyth the ſhotte of their Croſſe bowes, Dartes, and
ſuche lyke, throwen by the arme, they aboue vſed theyr
Mykes ſo well, that they threwe the Turkes contynuallye
from theyr ladders downe, ſlewe and hurte a

greate number of them, and handled them ſo hardlye
that they enforſed them to ſcatter, and made them glad
to abandone the aſſaute, wherevpon Mahometh drewe
neare with his company, and encouraged them, calling
by name nowe one and then another, eſpecyally thoſe
that were moſte valiaunte and worthye, comfortynge
them to reuiue the aſſaute,The third aſſaulte. and in y• end ſome he threatened
wyth cruell wordes, and to other ſome he made
great and large promiſes, and in this ſorte wroughte
with them, that he cauſed them to put on noble mindes
and to begynne agayne the aſſaulte, with farre greater
furye then before, and euerye man ſoughte to gette
vp the wall, one clymynge on the others ſhoulder and
vp by theyr Pykes lyke Cattes, ſome other wont cloſe
together, couerynge theyr heades with theyr targes
and roundels and they that were on the lowe ſteppes
of the ladders, vare before them euen of force, thoſe
that were on the hygheſt of the ladders, and manye
layde holde of the Pikes and punchinge ſtaues of theyr
enemies as they thruſt at them, and ſo with greate courage
gate vp walles, and when they were at the
higheſt were ſtricken downe headlonge into the botome
of the dyke, by them of the towne, and alſo they made
ſuche ſpoyle of the enemies by throwynge downe vpon
them, huge ſtones, artificiall fyres, burnynge Piche,

ſtrange to behold, yet not withſtāding the emperour

Giuſtiniano, a Genoueſe borne, a Noble manne in

to bee in Conſtantinople, and behaued hymſelfe ſo
worthelye in the defence thereof, that they imputed
the greateſt parte of theyr defence to conſiſt in hym, vntyll
that at the laſte, as he was valiauntlye fightinge

vpon the walles with the enemies, through diſgrace he
was ſore wounded, and as it is ſayde ſeing him ſelfe to
loſe much bloude, woulde not diſcourage the multitude
with callinge for a Surgion, but ſecrently wt drewe him
frō the aſſaute, of whoſe departure, when Cōſtantine ye
Emperour vnderſtode, he feared it wouldbe the loſſe of
the citie, whervpon he went in perſon to him, & deſired
him not to leue y• aſſaute, but Giuſtiniano would by no

            When the Emperour ſawe the ſhamefull flighte and
great diſorder of his people, he alſo fled after them, not
regardyng his imperial maieſtie,The death of Cōſtantine the emperour▪
                nor ſekynge as it became
ſo mightie a prince, rather honourably to die with

not diſcoraged, but weryed with ouercommyng of

Pera, and from thence by ſea to Scio, fell ſicke eyther

died, not enioying that great honour, whiche he had
wonne,The death of Giuſtinian. and truely he had bene happye yf he had died vp

accordynge to the cuſtome of the Turkes, dyd
celebrate to his Baſcias and Captaines, a very ſumptuous
feaſte, and when they had eaten and dronken more
then ſufficient, he thoughte it good to honour his banket

himſelfe that forthwith the Turkes ſhoulde
haue bene chaſed out of Gretia, but after, when he ſawe
the biſhoppes preparation toke none effect: he was enforſed
with great gyftes and paiment of the tribute for
two yeres before hande at one paiment, to reconcile him
ſelfe to Mahometh, and to renewe the league betwene
them, wherevpon Mahometh deſſemblynge for a tyme
the iniurie that he had receyued at his hande, receyued
him agayne into his fauour and protection, but within
fewe yeres after, when he perceyued himſelfe to be aſſured
in his ſeate in Gretia, he called to mynde the foreſaide
rebellion, and ſente his armie into Peloponeſſo,
and toke the walle of Eſmilia, that was buylded vpon
the ſtraite called Iſthmos, which ſhutteth vp that ſtrait
of lande, beynge fyue myles in breadeth ſtretchynge
from the ſea Ionio to the ſea Egeo,Eſmilia. of the which ſeas,
all the reſt of Morea which aunciently was called Pel
                  •
               
poneſſo is enuironed. And when the Turks had wonne
the walle, they entred into Morea, and toke the citie of
Corintho, and made bothe the Diſpotts his vaſſalles,
the one being deuided from the other, and toke frō them
their ſtate and patrimonie. The prouince of Peloponeſſo
is the chiefe parte of Gretia for the commodiouſnes
thereof, and alſo for the great wealth and power of the
nobilitie and commons that in the olde worlds inhabited
the ſame, that piece of grounde well conſidered, will
declare it ſelfe to be the foundation of the Greke Empyre,
for as muche as in it there are manye godlye
goolfes, many large and great caues, and promontories,
manye manifique and ſumptuos cities, and they
ſaye that the forme of the platte therof: is like vnto that
of the leafe of a platane,Peloponeſſo in lēgth 175. miles in circuite, it is 5505. myles. the length and breadeth therof
are almoſt equall, and from the one ende to the other
it conteyneth a hundred, ſeuentie and fyue miles, and
in circuite (accordyng to the opinion of Pollible) it conteyneth
fyue hundred myles, and Anthemidoro addeth
vnto it fyftye miles, and and we haue declared it is enuironed
with two ſeas, ſauynge that piece of lande called

Iſthmos, which confyneth vpon the ſeas afore ſayd and
containeth in lengthe v. miles, nere where vnto, is the
noble and famous citie Corintho, and their is contayned
in y• ſame Peloponeſſo,Peloponeſo nowe called Morea. nowe called Morea, Achaia,
Meſſenia, Licaonia nowe called Lacedemonia, Largolica,
and Arcadia, which lieth in the middeſte of them, but
nowe retorning to the declaration of our hiſtorie beginning
where we lefte, when Mahometh was becomme
lorde of Conſtantinople, and beinge determined, there
to appoint the ſeate of his Empire, the firſte thing that
he toke in hand, was to amend and repare the walles of
the citie, and to make them defenſyble, & alſo to repare
the ſpoyled buyldings of the towne, and alſo to furniſhe
it with inhabitants for that it wanted a great number
by meanes of y• great ſlaughter that there had ben wher
vpon he cauſed inhabitants to come oute of all partes,
and gaue to them greate priuileges and liberties to vſe
what traffique, and alſo what religiō they wolde wher
vpon within ſhorte ſpace there came thither an infinite
numbre of inhabitants, namely of Hebrues or Iues
which were chaſed oute of Spaine, beſyde thys he vſed
the cuſtume that the princes of the eaſte partes of the
worlde doe vſe, which is that when ſoeuer he toke anye
Citie or Towne after that tyme, he woulde take oute
of them the chiſe and moſt, noble houſholdes and families,
with al their treaſure and ſubſtance, and ſend them
to Conſtantinople, to inhabite there, he vſed the matter
ſo that at ye tyme of his death, he lefte it a Citie of great
traffique: and alſo maruelouſly repleniſhed with inhabitants
as ſone as he was become Emperour of Conſtantinople
he determyned in him ſelfe, the warres againſt
the hungarianes Iudging it a great aſſurance to
his ſtate of Europe, yf that he mought bring to paſſe, to
ſubdue Hungarie and make it ſubiecte to him, which he
greatly defired conſideringe the propinquitie thereof, &
alſo the valiantize of y• people, he determined to prouide
him of & aptaines of great Iudgement and of good ſoul
diours and to aſſure him in his ſeate of Gretia, whervp
on he deferred the enterpriſe for thre yeres, and began
to make warres vpon the citie of Athenes which onelye

reſted oute of his handes, of all the prouince of Attica,
which Citie althoughe it were then of no great circuite,
ne yet anye thing in comparysſon ſo Populouſe
or riche, as it had ben in tyme before, yet notwithſtanding,
thei had builded a forte vpon the walles that were
lefte of the ancient Temple of Minerua,Temple of Mynexua. whiche was
thoughte inprennable, bnt the lorde therof which was a
florentine borne, and of the noble houſe of Acciauolli,
ſeing no waye howe to defende it,the lord of. Athenes a florentyne borne. for ſo much as he had
attempted the princes of Italie in ſondrie ſorte for aide,
but all was in vaine, wherupon he fel to compoſition wt 
him and agreed to delyuer him the Towne, in exchaūg
of certaine houſes and yerly rentes that ye Turcke hadAthenes renderid to Mahometh.
promiſed him for the maintenance of him felfe and his
familie, and herupon yelded the Towne to the Turcke
when the Turke had recompenſed him, he toke frō him
two of his ſonnes and brought them vp in his Seraglio
to ſerue him, of the which two, one proffited ſo well in
the exerciſe of armes, and alſo in gouernance, that the
Turcke had him in great eſtimation. And in Albania,
the whiche is that part of Macedonia that lieth toward
the weſte, and ſtretche the oute frō Durazzo, to the ancient
Citie Appolonia, the langage of the Albaneſes is
propre to them ſelues, and dothe differ from the ſpeche
of all thoſe people that dwell aboute them, for neither
the Greeke, ne yet the Schiauoneſe vnderſtandeth it,
and we are not certaine in what ſorte, nor by what
meanes, they fyrſte arriued in thoſe partes, ne yet
of their ancient originall, althoghe it be ſayde that
this nation, with diuerſe others, came oute of
Scithia Aſiatica, from that ancient Citie Albania not
farre from Colchide,Albaneſes diſcendyd from the Scythianes and ſo went on wandring to ſeeke
newe habitacions and ſeates, and fynally occupied
that parte of Macedonia whiche beareth their name, aboute
the tyme of the loſſe of Conſtantinople the
prince of their contrey happened to dye, whoſe name
was Camuſa,Camuſa. whoe beinge diſcended of chriſtian
parents: became ſo beaſtly, that of his owne
acorde he lefte the chriſtian faythe and embraced the
foliſheand beaſtly religion of Mahometh, but hauinge

ſmalle affiance in it, euen as he had raiſhely forſaken
Chriſte, ſo vnaduiſedly refuſed he Mahomet he and retorned
to the religion of his anceſtours, willing (althoughe
he had no great affiance nether in the one nor
other) rather to dye beringe the name of a Chriſtian,
then of a Mahometiſte, vnto whome, George Scanderbag
ſuccided in gouernaunce as lawfull heire, whoe
was diſcended of a noble parentage in his contrey, and
when he had haunted the warres along time he became
an excellent and famous Captaine, and ſpent the reſte
of his lyfe in the defence of the Chriſtian religion, when
Mahomethe vnderſtode the deathe of Camuſa, he ſent
one of his Baſcias with an armie to Valona, whiche
ſtandeth vpon the ſea bancke, and althoughe it be but
a litle Towne, it hathe a ſuer and a goodly hauen, from
whence in to Italie the paſſage is but ſhorte and withoute
daunger, and manye yeres before that tyme, it
was poſſeſſed and holden by Baiazithe, and when he
died they threwe from them the Turquiſhe yoke, but
Amorathe within ſhorte ſpace after toke it againe, and
from thence for the was it contynually holden by the in
fydels, to the greate reproche and diſhonour of the Chriſtian
princes, and to the greate terrour of all Italie,
it is poſſeſſyd euen at this daye by the infidels, when
this Baſcia had broughte his people to valona, he aſſayled
Scanderbeg, whoe althoughe he dyd alwaies
worthilye defende him ſelfe and his people, and diuers
tymes with his power had encountred the Turckes,
and departed from them alwayes with the victorie,
yet notwithſtandinge he ſent for ayde to the
kinge Alphonſo of Aragone,Scanderbeg to king Alphonſo of Naples. then kinge of Naples,
and obtained of him dyuers bande of men at armes,
well furniſhed in euery reſpecte, whiche paſſed in
to Albania by the waye of Durazzo, not farre
from the Cytye of Croia, and with the helpe
of George Scanderbeg they defendyd that contre for
alonge tyme from the Tyrannie of the infydels,
when Calixto the Romiſhe, Byſhoppe vnderſtode the

danger that Scanderbeg was in,Callirio the Byſhope of Rome. Scanderbeg was in, weinge his power wt 
the vnſpekeable power of his enemye, he wolde not ſe
him wāte but ſupplied him with a great ſome of money
to entertaine his ſouldiours and with theſe aydes he de
fendyd y• contrey of Albania, very ſkylfully and valiantly.
In this meane time their was a practize diſcouerid,A practiz

                   diſcouerid ye
whiche a Nephewe of his, his brothers ſonne, whoe hauing
intelligence with Mahometh, agreed with him vp
oncertaine condityones, to ſleye his vncle by treaſon,
or els if he coulde by any meanes bring it to paſſe, to delyuer
him on lyue in to Mahomethes handes, when this
practeze was diſcouered by one of the menagers of this
ſame, he laid handes on him, and ſo cauſed him to be examined,
in the which he confeſſyd the whole, wherupon
he thought it not conueniēt to ſhed his owne bloude,
but baniſhed him, ſending hym with his proceſſe to the
king Alphonſo, whoe commaunded to put him into the
Donge on called Miglio, there to continewe during his
naturall lyfe. And whileſte Scanderbeg lyued, he
defended Albania from the tirany of the infydels, fyghting
onely for the zeale, he bare to the Chriſtian religiō
& cauſed his ſubiectes to perſeuere in the faith of chriſte
and his worde, notwithſtanding the contynuall inuasious,
and courſes that his enemies made vpon his cotre
impoueriſhing his ſubiectes vtterly ſpoiling y• laborers
of the earthe, lainge waſte a greate pece of his contrey,
bringing it into vnſpekeable miſerie and calamitie, whē
Mahometh vnderſtode the death of Scanderbeg he ſent
forth with his armie in to Albania, and toke the citie of
Croia with all the reſte of the contrey except thoſe places
that the venetianes held, aboute that tyme after the
taking of Conſtantinople, he dyd maruelouſly vexe the
religion of Rhodes both by ſea and land, but the greate
maſter of the Hoſpitall of Iheruſalm vnto whome the
Iſle dyd appertaine, with his ſouldiours, defended it cō
               tynnally
euen to theſe our dayes, and whan Calixto the
gre at Byſhope was called vnto for ayde he put his Nauie
of Shippes & Galleys to y• ſea, & ſent them to Rhodes,
vnderthe conducte of y• patriarcke of Aquileia, who
being in thoſe ſeas, had often to doe with the Turckes

toke and drowned manye of their Galleys and fuſtes,
drowned and ſlewe their people, and departed alwaye
from them with the victorie, & when he had taken from
the Turkes y• Iſle of Salaminā whiche in ancient tyme
was called Lēno, and alſo that, that is called Taſſo, wt
the Iſle of Nēbro and certaine other litle Iſles, nere vn
to them, he went and ſpoyled all alonge the ſea coaſtes
from heleſponto euen to the confynes of Egipte, to the
great impoueriſſing of the inhabitants there of, holding
them in contynuall doute and feare and it ſemed that
if he mought haue contynued, he wolde with time haue
greatly preuailed, but as ſone as Calixto was deade he
departed from thence with his Nauie, in to Italie, leauing
Rhodes with all others places that y• Chriſtianes
poſſeſſid in thoſe partes, in great peryl. And in Acarnia
which lieth in the myddeſte betwene Epiro, and Boetia

deſtrous to talke with the Diſpotto, ſent to him deſirīg
him that if it were not a trouble vnto him, that he wold
voucheſafe to ſpeake with him, wherunto the Diſpotto
agreed, and vpon a daye they mette, and by there Turc

men had great diſcourſe of the Chriſtian faithe and Capreſtand
dyd approue by great reaſon, the auctoritie of
the Romiſhe churche, and the opinion of ye ſame as touching
the Chriſtian faith, in ſuch ſorte, that he conſtrained
the Diſpotto (not hauing reaſon to anſwere for him
ſelfe in that behalfe) to yelde, and woulde haue had him
to refuſe ye errour, in the which he and his people were,
and to haue embraced the religion and faith of the Romiſhe
church, vnto whome George, laying all reaſon a

And for that he coulde obtaine no aide at ye kings hande

death of Mahomethe, the one parte,
eſpecially the nobilitie fauoring Sultan Gemma, and ye
Gianizaries the partie of Baiazithe, and therfore immediatly
vpon the death of Mahomethe, the Gianizzaries
marched wyth all ſpede to Conſtantinople, and for ſomuch
as Baiazithe was at that tyme in Natolia, they
toke a yonge ſonne of his named Corcuthe, & when they
had ſaluted him Emperour, they bare him aboute
thorowe all the citie to ſhewe him to the people,Baiazithe the 10. king and cauſed

and after great ſlaughter on bothe ſydes,Gemma defeicted. Baiazithe became
maſter of the feelde, Gemma beinge broken, and
abandoned of his people, fled, with certaine of his truſtie
fryndes with him to Rhodes, and the great maiſter of ye
religion (fearing leſte by holding of him he mought purchaſe
the innimitie of Baiazith and ſo prouoke him to
warres) ſent him wel garded with certaine ſhippes into
Fraunce, from whence afterward by commaundement
of Innocentio the viii. Byſhoppe of Rome, he was ſent
to Rome, and beinge receauid by the Byſhoppe, had his
lodginges appointed in the heighte of the Palace, and
was there for a longe tyme garded with great diligence
the pope agreed with Baiazithe for a yerely penſion of
thirtie thouſand ducates ſo to kepe hym garded duringe
the lyfe naturall of Gemma.An offer of the king Ferrante. In this meane tyme the
king Ferrante being in Italie receauid Aduertyſement
of the death of Mahomethe, and cauſed it to be declared
to thoſe of Ottranto, & offeryd them (that yf they wolde
delyuer into his handes the Citie) he wolde ſett them al
ſafely into Gretia with all ſuch goodes and treaſure as

there was a trewes taken for a certaine tyme, the Captaines

into the galleys, and helde them of force all, ſauing certaine
of them beinge men of place, and circumſpect, who

ſhoulde ſuffer them to enioye both lyfe and goodes, whē
Baiazithe was come into the Citie, he vſed ye Citizenes
very gently, and wolde not ſuffer anye of his armye to
enter into the towne but onely thoſe that were appointed
to ye garde bothe of his perſon and towne, and when
the Automne was come on, the ſharpnes of the wether
was ſuche, that he coulde not well holde his people in ye

in the townes there aboute, from whence he ouer ran &
ſpoyled all the contrey and wolde not ſuffer the ſubiects
of Caromano other to ſowe and plowe the grounde, orels
to doe anye thinge in the feeldes that moughte befor
their commoditie, whervpon they that dwelled vpon
the plaine were in ſuche diſtreſſe, that of their owne

acorde they reuolted from Caromano, for the greateſt
number, and became ſubiectes to Baiazithe, when the
ſpringe of the yere was cōme, Caromano (conſideringe
the inclination of his people and being in feare to be forſaken
of his ſouldiours, or els to be delyuered by them
into the hands of Baiazithe) obtaine of the Soldane of
Egipte,Caromano ayded by the Soldain Caribeio. Caribeio (a man of much fame and worthines)

he ſent into all partes of his dominions for ſuch
ayde, as there was to be had, and ioyned them all with
his armie, and made it of as great number as he coulde,
and determyned to ſe howe fortune wolde fauour hym
and rather to Hazard the battayle then to gyue place to
his enemie and in tyme to be delyuered by his owne mē
into the handes of his enemyes whervpon beinge furniſhed
with all neceſſaries, he toke the feelde, and choſe a
place of great ſtrengthe and apte for the ſeruice of horſe
men, when Baiazithe vnderſtode that the enemey was
come to the feelde and in campe, he ſent to all his garniſones
commaūdinge them to repare vnto hym wyth
ſpede, & with them to bring their whole furniture, and
when he had taken reuewe of them, he marched to the
feelde and put his ſouldiours in battayle, and then marched
towarde Caromano,The battayle betwene Baiazithe & Caromano. and when he came wtin ſighte
of him he ſent his vauntgarde toward his enemie ſome
thinge ſpedyly, to begyn the battayle, and he in perſon
dyd conducte the battayle and folowed the Vauntgarde,
he alſo was folowed by the rierewarde, and all his bagagers,
and when he came where the enemies were, they
refuſed not the battayle, he came towarde them in good
order and ioyned with them, and notwithſtanding that
the force of Baiazithes people was greate, and that a
troupe of ten thouſand horſemen of his went and ſerred
them ſelues and with great furie aſſayled the enemies,
perſwading them ſelues, that in the firſt encoūtre they
woulde diſorder them, but the Ciliceanes recauid theyr
charge with great aſſurance, in ſuche ſorte, that there
was not one of them that gaue one fote of grounde to
his enemie. After this when they were entremelled,
there began a very braue and blooddie fyghte, men fell

downe dead and hurte, contynally on bothe ſydes, and
their places were alwaies ſupplied with freſhe men, and
in this ſorte they contynued for the greateſt parte of the

his owne hande he ſlewe dyuerſe of thoſe which aſſailed
him, & in the ende throughe the great loſſe of his bloude

and a great parte of the reſt were taken on lyue and delyuered
to Baiazith,Ripe iudgement of Baiazithe. when he had in this ſorte obtained
ſo greate a victorie, he determyned forthewith to vſe the

in ſhorte tyme broughte vnder his obeiſance all that contrey

inhabited, a citie of greate traffique & maruelouſly well
inhabited by meanes of the decaie of the trade that was
in Delo, whiche in tyme paſſed was a Citie of the greateſt
traffique of all Aſia, and chiefely for the great number
of ſlaues that then were there boughte, and ſolde,
which were in nūber in maner infinite, wherof it grewe
into prouerbe, marchantes make your voyage to Delo,
and there vnſhippe, for whatſoeuer is broughte thither
is redie money, when the traffique of this Citie was decaied
the whole traffique and trade of marchandize was

not excede the number of xx. M. men on horſbacke wher
vpon examining him ſelfe, he determyned to proue, rather

y• clementie then force of ſo mightie a prince, & whē
they had talked vpō certaine articles of agrement,Agrement betwene Baiazithe and the prince of Scandaloro. they
concluded, that vpon condition, that Baiazithe ſhoulde
gyue him certaine reuenewe in Natolia, he wolde delyuer
vnto him all his poſſeſſyon and dominion of the contrey
of Cilicia called Trachea, whervpon it came to
paſſe that when Baiazithe was become lorde of bothe
the contreys called Cilicia al yt townes of the ſea coaſte
from propontide or ſtraicte of Gallipoli euen to the confines
of Soria, were vnder his obeiſance ſo that all was
his euen from the one to the other, whē Baiazithe was
in this ſorte agreed with the prince of Scandaloro, and
become prince of both the one and other Cilicia, and alſo
of a great parte of the mounte Tauro, he contynued
there vntyll that he had made ye whole: one gouernaūce
or prouince, and appointed vnto it for gouernour, one of
his Baſcias, leuing with him for garde therof, an armie
ſufficient this done he determined to precide in hys
enterpriſe, and to ſubdue the reſte of the ſtate & poſſeſſion
of Caromano which was in Armenia the leſſer, and
in Capadotia, whervpon, he paſſed the mounte Tauro,
and deſcended into the leſſe Armenia and became lorde
withoute any difficultie of all the countres, and townes
that there had ben poſſeſſyd by Caromano, all the people
came and yeldyd them ſelues to him of their owne a
corde, when he had thus done he marched on by the ſyde
of the mounte Tauro toward the northe and al the people
and townes y• reſtid of the Iuriſdiction of Caromano
came and renderid them ſelues wholly vnto him, and
when he had thus in ſhorte tyme acheuid ſo great an enterpriſe
he determined to leade home warde his armye,
and entred into Licaonia, and in Iconio, and Tocato,
be lefte his Aſtatique armye in garniſon, vnder ye charg
and conducte of Muſtaffa his Baſcia, and then he entred
into Galatia, and from thence into Bithinia the neareſt
waye to Burſia, and from thence went downe into
the Golfe of Nicomedia, and there embarcked him ſelfe
with the reſt of his armie and ſayled towarde Romania
and there landed with al hys people ſately, when he had
this done, he toke the ſea agayne, with his ſouldiours

of Gretia and ſayled on,Baiazithe retorned to Conſtantinople and landed in the hauen of Conſtantinople,
where he was receauyd of all the people wt 
exciding great ioye, and there toke his horſe and rode aboute
al the Citie and thus with great pompe acording
to their cuſtume he went to lodge in hys palace called
Seraglio, which ſtandeth vpon that pointe, that is called
Cauodi ſanto Demetrio, beinge determined in the
nexte ſpringe folowing to goe againe into Cilicia with
all his power, to make warres againſt y• Soldane, chiefely
for that he had ayded Caromano againſt him, contrarie
to the order of a league betwene them, wherefore he
was much offended with the Soldane,The voiage of Baiazithe againſt Caromano. & departed from
thence with his courte and went to Andrinople, and all
that winter he was occupied in making preparation for
that iorney, and gaue order to lenie oute of all his dominions
of Europe newe bandes. The number of his artillerie
which he caried with him, was great, and when ye
ſpringe was cōme, in the begynninge of Apryll, he aſſemblyd
his armie, embarcked them and paſſed, them in
to Aſia. And when he had paſſed throughe Bithinia and
Galatia, he broughte them into licaonia to Iconio, and
ioyued them, with hys armye that he had lefte there wt 
Muſtaffa his Baſcia at his departure from thence, whē
he had this done, he entred againe into Cilicia toward
the mounte Tauro and Armenia, and there receauid aduedtizement,
that the Soldane, as ſone as he herd of the
death of Caromano, fearing lefte Baiazithe (being puffed
vp in pride throughe the great victorie that he had obtained
againſt Caromano in the reuenge of the ayde y•
the Soldane had ſent him) ſhoulde attempte ſome great
enterpriſe in Soria,Diadaro, a name of honour appertainīg alwaies: to the admiralles of Alexandrie. whervppon he ſent all the Mamalukes
that were in his courte vnder the conducte of the
great Diadaro to the confines of Cilicia, acompanied wt 
a great numbre of Arrabianes, wherfore Baiazith was
ſome what in doubte what was to doe (conſidering the
great preparatiō of the enemy) althoughe he were acompained
with an armie of well trayned ſouldiours, & had
broughte wyth hym moe, then one hundred thouſande
ſouldiours on horſebacke beſyde hys garde of Gianizaries,
and other bandes of fotemen, yet notwithſtanding

fearing y• vertue & diſcipline of the Mamalukes, whoſe
name was feared throughe all Aſia, for as much as they
were counted a people inuincible in battayle wherfore
he thought it good not raiſhly to trye his fortune in battayle,
nor on the other ſyde, to ſhowe any token of feare
wherby he moughte encorage his enemye to deale with
him, but admiſedly put his armie in order and then marched
on towarde Tarſo, the Mamalukes beinge aduertized
of the Turckes comming towarde them thoughte
it not good to tarie and ſuffer them to enter Soria, but
marched toward them to mete them vpon the waye and
when they were entred Cilicia, marchinge towarde the
Turcks (of whom thei made ſmalle acōpte) approchinge
neare vnto Tarſo, as ſone as they came within ſyghte
of them, they put them ſelues in battayle and marched
on towarde them, when Baiazith behelde ye comminge

vpon the Turckes with ſuche force, that not wythſtandinge
they receaued the charge (beinge well ſerred) and
prepared with great aſſurance, & gaue to their enemies
no place at all, yet for all that they had much to
doe to preſerue their order, that the Mamalukes had not
broken it, & after this when they approched the one the
others ſquadrones they were ſo ioyned that they coulde
vſe no long weapon but were driuen to vſe there Scimitarres,
and ſo continued they in ſo ſtreyte order fighting
with great aſſurance for a longe tyme, y• no man coulde
ſee of eyther ſyde, anye aduauntage, and Baiazithe althoughe
there were farre greater ſlaughter of hys people
then of the Mamalukes and Arrabianes, yet dyd he
alwayes ſupplie his weried and ſpoyled, ſquadrones wt 
newe and freſhe bandes and hauinge farre greater number
of ſouldiours then the Diadaro had, he continued the
fyghte in this order from the myddaye, tyll after the go
ing downe of the ſone, whervpon the great Diadaro determined
to vſe all force poſſyble to the ende y• the night

ſhoulde not ſonder them withoute victorie,The great diadaro an excellēt Captaine whervpon he
choſe oute of his, a nūber of ſouldiours in whom he had
great truſte and when they were ſome what repoſed he
renged them in battayle very cloſely & then ladde them
in perſon and charged the Turckes againe with ſuche
force that he thoughte veryly in that charge to diſorder
them, but notwithſtandinge that the Turckes receaued
the charge with great difficultie, yet they maintained
their order ſtyll and brake not, and althoughe that they
in dyuerſe places, makinge hed to the enemye they defendyd
them ſelues but ſlenderly and were in maner redie
to breake, yet Baiazithe throughe his good order relyued
them in ſuche ſorte with his preſence and his repoſed
garde of Gianizaries, that he encoraged his people,Good prouidēce of Baiazithe
renued the fyghte and repulſed ſome what the Mamalukes,
and fearing that yf his people ſhoulde be charged
againe by the Mamalukes, he ſholde not be able to maintaine
their order, whervpon he thoughte it good to preuent
this miſcheife, and with all his force to charge the
enemie, and then retiring by litle and litle to abandone
the fighte, thincking in this forte to gyue place and to a
noid the loſſe of his whole armie, rather then to make
good the place & to be charged by the enemye and ſo put
to fighte, whervpon he retired his people (in that ſame
order wherin they had foughte all the daye before) with
their faces to warde the enemie, fightinge cōtynually in
their retreyte in good order, althoughe notwtoute great
loſſe, & in this forte broughte his people into his campe
to their lodginges, which he lefte wel fortified with trenches
and rampares, and alſo well garded with ſouldiours,
whervnto, when the Mamalukes approched the
nexte morninge folowing, and conſyderid the fortification
therof, the greate quantitie of the artillerie placed
vpon the bulwarckes and rampares therof, and alſo the
number of the garde there vnto appointed, they durſte
not to aſſayle their campe but retired them ſelues. And
it ſemed to Diadaro that he had for that tyme well prouided
both for the ſecuritie of Soria, and alſo for his eſtimation,
thincking it not good to entre into furder peril
whervppon he retorned againe to Aleppo from whence

he came, and when he had conſumed the reſte of the ſommer
in proinge and ſpoilinge the confines of the Turckes
countrey and that Automne was comme vpon him
he appointed his people to garniſon vpon the confynes
of Soria, and Baiazithe appointed his in the lyke ſorte
in the prouince of Cilicia, then Baiazithe practized an
atonemēt with the Soldane and many Oratours were
ſent betwene them, from the one to the other,Digressiō
                whervnto
it was an eaſy matter to perſwade the Soldane notwithſtāding
his victorious ſucceſſe. This Soldane was
the cheife in degree and acompted him ſelfe y• firſte prince
of the Mahometane relygion, and takinge vpon him the

with greate cerimonie, and beſyde that, the eldeſte
of a noble houſe in Cairo, and it is ſayd that anciently

for ye ſpace of thre C. yeres and moe, they neuer
enlarged their confynes, nor ſoughte to poſſeſſe the
dominions of others, the which, there maner and order
of gouernance dyd chiefely cauſe, for they prouided in y•
begynninge and made a lawe,Note. that none ſhoulde be Soldane,
but be election, and that alſo he ſhoulde be of their
communaltie, that is a ſlaue, not yet worthye to be admitted
into the order of the Mamalukes, with whome
was the whole gouernance, and auctoritie to electe and
chewſe the Soldane, the children of the Soldane neuer
ſucceded their father in gouernance, no more dyd they of
y• Mamalukes ſuccede in the place of their fathers, neither
in warres, ne yet in anye publique prehemuinence,

y• propre goodes and enheritaunces of their fathers,

which they lefte vnto them at their deathe, & vſed
the ſame exerciſe and trade of lyfe that other of the countre

meanes of his ambaſciadours, and Oratours, had pacified
the Soldane, renued and cōfirmed y• ancient league
and confideracie y• had ben of a longe tyme betwene the
Soldanes, and his houſe, and eſtabliſhed his gouernement
in Cilicia, he retorned to Burſia the neareſt waye
& then embarcked him ſelfe with his ſouldionrs of Europe,
and retorned into Gretia, and when he be came thether
he ceaſed from al hoſtilitie, & gaue him ſelfe wholly
to prouide for the quietnes of his people, and ſent hys
ſouldiours to garniſones, and gaue order for the adminiſtration
of Iuſtice in all places. after this, he gaue him
ſelfe wholly to the ſtudie of the Alchorane,Alchoran a Boke wherin are conteyned the cheife pointes of the Turcke his Religion. & of naturall
philoſophie, in the whiche he had greate delighte, in ſo
muche that he had alwayes aboute him, of all nationes
mē excellently wel ſeen in phiſycke, in whoſe companie
he paſſyd the greateſt parte of his time, and when he had
in thys ſorte ſpent manye yeres he was moued to take
in hande newe enterpriſes, by occaſion that was offery
                  •
               
to make him lorde of Corcira nowe called Corfu, being
certifyed by certayne Greekes of the Iſle who had practized
with them of the fortes and ſo broughte to paſſe y•
they wolde render the fortes vnto him at all tymes,Practize of Baiazithe to betray Corfu. vpon
condition, that he ſhoulde conſider them acordinge to
their ſeruice, and offeryd them alſo to take the Citie and
the reſt of the Iſle & to deliuer the whole into his hands
this matter ſemed vnto him lykely, and poſſyble to be
broughte to paſſe, and alſo that he coulde not make a
conqueſte more mete for the aſſurance of hys ſtate, nomore
apte to anoie the enemyes of his religion, immediatly
he determyned in him ſelfe the order of the enterpriſe
& for that he wolde not that y• Venetianes ſhoulde
ſuſpecte him, he began to make redie his Nauie, and to
prepare his armie by land, & bruted that he wolde make
warres vpon the people of Valachia, and Moncaſtro &
when he had made redie al thinges both by ſea and land
the Venetian Nauie retorninge from Candie, whether
it were by chaunce, or els y• ye generall therof had ſome

kinde of intelligence of the practize, he came to Corſu, &
acording to their cuſtume, when he had ſeen the moniti
on, & vewed the gardes of the fortes & townes, he toke
awaye the olde ſouldiours and put newe in their places
and toke with him certaine men that dwelled in Corſu
and when he had ſpoyled al the ſea coaſte of the Golfe he
retorned with his Nauie to Veniſe, which when Baiazithe
vnderſtode he diſſembled the matter as thoughe he
had ment nothinge at all that waye, and wolde not diſcouer
his practize by the ſodden vnrigging of his Nauie
and ſo to loſſe the greateſt parte of the charges that he
had ben at, whervpon he determyned to take in hand the
enterpriſe which he had bruted and put his Nauie to the
ſea and ſent them towarde the ſea called mare magioro,
and he in perſon with his armie,Baiazith in Valachia. went by land thorowe
Burgaria towarde the prince of Valachia, who dwelled
in the loer partes therof towarde the ſea Euſino, he entred
into his caūtre inuading and ſpoyling a great part
therof, the prince therof, knowing him ſelfe not able to
withſtande the force of this mightie prince, determined
to proue yf he mighte by anye meanes growe to an appointment
with him and ſo to ſaue hym ſelfe hauinge
greate hope in the cortezic and goodnes of Baiazithe,
wherof the fame was ſpred all the countrey ouer, and
fylled ſo the myndes of men that all men had good hope
of him, and ſendinge his Oratours vnto him in very hū
               ble
ſorte to demaūde peace of him, ye whiche when Baiazithe
had herde, he graunted their requeſt withoute difficultie,
vpon condition that he ſhoulde paie vnto hym
yerely a certaine ſumme of money in the name of a tribute,
whervpon he wolde receaue him into his protection,
when he had thus done, he paſſed the ryuer of Danubio
and marched on vntyll he came within the ſyghte of
Moncaſtro, where he had alſo ſyghte of his Nauie, Moncaſtro

the towne is alſo artificially ſtronge and of great emportance,
by meanes of the commodities of the conntre, of
the ryuer, and of the ſea, and it is of greate reputation

in all the countres aboute it, which it wone in the tyme
of Sultane Mahometh, who went thyther wt his campe
and beſegyd it, and when he had batterid it by the ſpace
of a moneth, he was enforced by meane of y• great colde
to leuie his campe, and to departe thence withoute it,
when Baiazithe had ſpoyled and proied all the countre
aboute it, and ſawe that they of y• towne came not forth
to the feelde,Baiazithe beſegeth Moncaſtro in very good order. he cauſed his Nauie to approche neare to
the towne and forthewith beſegyd it bothe by ſea and
land, in ſuche ſorte that they of the towne were nether
able to ſend forthe, nor receaue into them any man, and
when he ſawe the inhabitantes therof determyned to defend
it, he planted his batteries, and began to batter &
make ſondrie breaches, and when he had contynued his
batterie by ye ſpace of many dayes, he had made ſo great
breaches that it ſemyd vnto him that his men moughte
enter the towne at their pleaſure, wherfore when he had
appoynted his Colonels howe they ſhoulde ſuccede the
one the other in the aſſaulte, y• nexte morning folowing
at the pointe of the daye they preſented them ſelues in
battayle before the towne.
            Thoſe of the towne were redie at the breaches, & had
maruelouſly fortified againſte the cannon, with ſtronge
rampares and excedinge depe dykes, and defended them
ſelues nobly, in ſuche ſorte, that when the enemies preſented
them ſelues to the breaches to enter the towne,
ſtraight way they were with them at the puſhe of ye p

               ke
and beſtowed vpon them ſuche ſtore of ſhotte, artifeciall
fyres, caſting ſperes, and great ſtones, that they enforted

ſo worthily in their defence, that they ſtewe and hurte an
exceding great number of ye enemyes, and repulſed them
often times clene from the breaches but ye enemies were
alway ſupplyed wyth newe regymentes, and renewed
ſtyll the aſſaulte, and gaue them of the towne no tyme
at all to repoſe, and they had of their people ſlayne, and
hurte contynually, and had not meanes to be ſupplied wt 
newe, wherby the defendantes began excidingly to decaye
and not to be able to anſwere all places, whervpon
they receauyd greater hurte of y• fewe whych they loſte,

then dyd the enemye of the great ſlaughter ye was made
of his, when Baiazithe had in this ſorte contynued the
aſſaulte the greateſt parte of the daye, he commaunded
to ſounde the retreicte and broughte his people home to
their lodgings, determyning the nexte morning ſo to deuide
the regymentes of his armie, that he wolde apointe
the Colonelles of the firſt aſſaulte ſo to be ſupplied from
tyme to tyme with newe regymentes, that they of the
towne ſhoulde reſte, nether daye, nor nighte, and in this
ſorte, he ment to conſume them, & to cut thorowe their
newe workes which they had made againſt ye Cannon,
and ſo to enter the towne, and beinge in this determination
he commaunded hys people to goe to reſte: wylling
them to be redie in battaile the next morning before the
ryſing of the ſunne to aſſayle the towne againe, and neuer
to leue the aſſaulte til thei had repulſed, the enimies
and taken the towne of force, or els there to leaue their
lyues, when they of the towne vnderſtode the great preparation
of the enemie for the aſſaulte, they dyſcoraged
not at al (not withſtanding the great peryll y• they were
in, for that they wanted defendantes, conſydering their

to their handes as men of noble myndes, & repared thoſe

ſuche force as they had to defende there towne to the vttermoſt.
The daye folowing Baiazithe brought his people
againe in order to the walles with great noyſes and

them both their lyues and goodes, and alſo it ſhoulde be
in their choiſe whether they wolde contynue there ſtyll
or els departe the towne, when they of the towne had
herde the offer of this noble prince, and had no meanes
to ſaue their lyues, conſydering that their people were
ſo conſumed that they had not number ſufficient to furniſhe
the breaches that were made, wherfore they toke
a tyme to anſwere, whervpon the cheife of the citie gatheryd

determined to accepte the conditiones that were offerid

that they had of Baiazithe to haue them faithfully
obſerued, whervpon they agreed, and ſent their meſſagers
to him offering him the towne, which Baiazith
willingly accepted, and obſerued his promes with ſuch

to continue that winter in Morea & to make

newe inhabitantes to dwell in it, and changed ye name

Proconeſſo, from whence afterwarde he bracke, & came
to Rome, they appointed in his place Captaine general
of their armata, Marchio Treueſano, and ſeing that of
them ſelues they were not able to endure the charges
of ſo great warres, they ſent to the king Lois of Fraūce
for aide, who ſent them oute of prouince & Genoa, ſeuen
ſhyppes well armed and furniſhed, and fyftene galleys

from Genoa and ſayled towarde ye Archipelago (whiche

that they came before it they planted their batteryes
and batterid in ſuche ſorte that they ſo feared ye Turcks
of the towne with their ſodden aſſaulte, ye notwithſtanding
there was within it a graniſon of greate fame, of
men of great experience, yet they were ſo affraied that
they ſent their poſtes by ſea and lande, to Baiazithe to
declare vnto him the great preparation and force of the
Chriſtianes, and the furie of their batteries, proteſting
vnto him: that yf they were not ſpedylye reliued they
ſhoulde not be able longe to defend it, when the arryual
of ye Nauie of Fraunce was commonly knowen in Conſtantinople
ye force of y• nation beinge then augmented

and increase ſo at that tyme, dyd put ſuche feare into the
whole Citie, and to all the reſte of Romania, that ye Mahometiſtes
beinge oute of all hope to contynue ani longer
in Gretia, immagined howe to prouide ſhyppes and
other veſſelles where with to flee into Aſia, rather then
to put them ſelues in order to ſuccour Mitileno, wher vp
on Baiazithe beinge excidingly moued with the confuſion

with their Nauie & vnited them wt the Nauie of Fraūce
and encreaſed ye power of the Chriſtans (cheifely of fote
men, wherof the frenſhe had great wante) but whē they
had taken Mitileno and ſome other one place in Gretia

they concluded by ye meanes of Andre Gritti)
and wolde no furder procure his indignation, or els that
the good ſucceſſe of the frenſhe dyd not lyke them whervpon
they in dede procided ſlowly in all their affares, &
cheifely, in furniſhinge the frenſhe Nauie with victuall

that when they had contynued there for a certaine ſpace
and made ſo great breaches ye yf they had had men ſufficient
to hane gyuen the aſſaulte they moughte eaſylye
haue taken the towne, but when they ſawe the tarying
of the Venetianes and the ſmale haſte that they made,
the Captaine of the frenſhe, beinge in great diſtreſſe of
victual by meanes wherof he coulde no lenger continue
there, and beinge alſo muche offendyd with there ſtacknes,
doubted that they went aboute te betraie him and

his people, and had them in great ſuſpition, where vpon
he embarcked his people and artillerie, diſolued the ſege
and ſet ſayle, paſſed the Golfe and then alonge by Scicilia
and retorned with his Nauie to Genea, and then be
in perſon toke the poſte and went into Fraunce, when
Baiazithe conſiderede the great peryll wherin he had ben
determining no more to incure the like, chiefely for that
he was of nature gyuen to be quiet and not ambitious
nor deſirouſe to enlarge the confines of his dominions
whervpon he determyned to attempte the Venetianes
for peace, and delyuered Andre a Gritti vpō ſuerties for
his retorne, & then embarcked him & ſent him to Veniſe
to entreate the peace, when Gritti was cōme to Veniſe
and founde the Senate, the Duke, and all the commons
of the Citie, well inclined to peace, after that he had had
great conference with the Senate, he receaued auctorye
and commiſſion from them to conclude the peace, whervpon
he retorned to Conſtantinople and concluded the
peace vpon ſuche conditiones as at this daye are obſerued
betwene them, and Baiazithe when he had in thys
ſorte ceaſed hys hoſtilitie, he lad his lyfe in great quietneſſe
and ſpent the greateſt parte of his time, his courte
being in Andrinople, at a certaine houſe of his not farre
from the Citie, a place of great pleaſure, where he buylded
for his commoditie maruelouſe ſumptuous & goodly
lodginges, and in this ſorte he paſſed a great pece of
his tyme in great quietnes, and beinge come to the age
of .lx. yeres, and hauinge gouerned in the Empire .xxx.
yeres, to the great content of all his ſubiectes, he began
lyke a wyſe man to conſyder that he was olde, and not
helthefull of bodye, and that he was lyke euery daye to
be ſurprinſed by dethe and to be taken awaye, wherfore
he was deſirous to prouide for, and eſtablyſhe his ſucceſſion
for the quietnes of his ſubiectes and to take awaye
all occaſyon of tumultes that moughte happen by hys
deathe, conſyderinge that he had three ſonnes of lawful
yeres, whome he had apointed in thre ſondrye partes of
Aſia to gouerne vpon his confynes, & euery of them had
vnder his charge a great armie, wherfore for onely remedie,
and maintenance of vnitie in his Empire, to the

ende that throughe the diſcorde of his ſonnes it ſhoulde
not be deuided and conſumed with Cyuyll warres, for
ſo muche as there was not a better remedie for to auoyd
ſuche diſorder then to folowe the example of Amorathe
his graud father, whiche was to giue ouer the gouernaunce,
and to prouide in his lyfe tyme for the eſtabliſhement
of his ſucceſſyon, and to appointe who ſhoulde ſuccede
him and to gyue ouer into his handes al power and
rule, and to put him in poſſeſſyon of the Empire which
ſhoulde be an occaſyon of great quietnes, for ſo much as
be (being olde and ſyckly and not able to endure ſo great
laboure and trauayle) thoughte that the people ſhoulde
be better gouerned by a yonger man and the other bretherin
ſhoulde be oute of hope to attayne to the Empire
whiche ſhoulde be all redie poſſeſſyd, by meanes wherof,
they ſhoulde be enforced to obey, yf that they wolde
not receaue furder incommoditie, and he beinge entred
into a priuate lyfe ſhoulde be more in quiet, and ſhoulde
prouide better for his helthe, & when he had in this ſorte
diſcourſed in him ſelfe, be then immagined whyche of
them he were beſt to appointe to ſuccede him in the Empire,
whervpon he thoughte it not mete to take frō anye
that that was his righte, wherfore he determyned that
Acomathe his eldeſte ſonne ſhoulde ſuccede in his place
and meaning by the diſcoueringe of his purpoſe to gyue
him greater reputacion, he brake it chiefely to the principall
Captaines and leaders of his Gianizzaries, and
horſemen, whervpon he diſpatched awaye one of his ſeruantes
to ſygnifie vnto him that the ſhoulde leue his confynes
well garded and repare into Gretia to his father
when Acomathe had receaued this commaūdement frō
his father, and being all redie certified frō his ſeruantes
whiche late at the porte, of the cauſe of this meſſage, he

number of gentle mē and courtiers, & ſo paſſed throughe
Licaonia Galatia & Bithinia and then paſſed the ſtraite
and landed in Gretia, and there vnderſtode that Baiazithe
was with his courte in Andrinople, wherevpon the
rode thyther, & when he came to his father, he receaued
him very ioyfully and aroſe oute of his chaire embraced

and of ye great entertainement that his father gaue him
and alſo howe that his father determyned to make him
Emperour in his lyfe tyme, and to reſigne his place vnto
him, Selim hauing a troublouſe head and being very
ambitiouſe, coulde in no wiſe be content that Acomathe
ſhoulde commaunde him, wherfore he ſought to preuent
as muche as in him was, that ſuche ſucceſſyon ſhoulde
take no place, whervpon he determined to comme to the
porte in perſon and departed from Trebiſonda where he
had his abydinge, withoute aſkinge his father licenſe, or
gyuinge him any thinge to vnderſtand therof, beinge acompanied
with ſixe hundred horſe men Tartarres and
Pontoiſes & paſſed on all the ſea coaſte of Euſino and
paſſed on throughe the countre of Valachia, and Burgaria,
and ſo came directly to Andrinople, and when he
came to his father he founde him greatly altred, & was
rebuked of him, for that, that he contrarye to the Conſtitution
and order of the Empire, was departed from
his charge withoute his licenſe, Selim was not amaſed
for that he ſawe his father offēded with him, but allegid
in his defence manye thinges, and declared that in hys
comming at that preſent, he folowed the example of his
brother Acomathe, deſyringe (for that his father was
olde) to ſee him before he ſhoulde dye and to receaue hys
bleſſyng) Baiazithe beinge ſome what moued with the
wordes of his ſonne, was cōtented to ſuffer him to kiſſe
his fete, and then he toke him vp and kyſſed him in the
forehede, and embraced him, & gaue him certaine giftes,

and then licenſid him and gaue him in charge to retorne
to his gouernance with all ſpede, but Selim deferred
his departure by all meanes poſſyble, and thoughte by
beinge conuerſant with the Gianizzaries and his horſe
men, and vſinge amonge them great liberalitie and actiuitie,
by theſe meanes, to aſſure him ſelfe of them, makinge
it to ſeme vnto them that he delighted in nothing
ſo muche as in the exerciſe of weapones, and rydinge of
horſes, and his whole diſcourſes were of warres, horſes
and weapones, he was in gyuinge, excedinge liberail,
& dyd contynually purchaſe frendſhippe amonge them.
This taryinge of his dyd greatly diſpleaſe Baiazithe,
wherfore he ſent vnto hym that he ſhoulde forthewith
departe, and gette him to his charge, but he euer allegid
one excuſe, or other, and in that ſorte as much as in him
was deferred his departure, in ſo muche that his father
beinge excedingly wrothe with him, ſent to declare vnto
him, that yf he dyd not forthe with departe the courte
he wolde ſo gyue order that he ſhoulde departe to hys
paine, whervpon he toke hys leue and departed with al
hys trayne, and rode on with his people toward Seruia
iiii. or v. dayes iorney, and there ſtaied at a place called
Scazacara, and the place was very commodious & mete
for his purpoſe, beinge from Andrinople iiii. dayes iorney,
and from Phillipoli ii. dayes iorney, and it ſtode vp
on a certaine paſſage that whoſoeuer came oute of Europe
to goe to the porte, he muſte comme that waye and
lodge there, when Selim had lodged his people, and fortifyed
his lodginges with thicke and mighty rampares
and depe dykes, he cauſed to brute that he wolde tarye
there for a ſpace & aſſemble his power, and then to goe
into Samandria againſt the Hungarians, when he had
in this ſorte fortifyed his lodginges, he ſtaied as manye
as came that waye, and chiefely all ſuche as came oute
of Gretia, dalmatia, Boſſina, Seruia, and Burgaria,
and caried to the porte, ye rentes, cuſtomes, and gabelles
that the Turcke receaued oute of thoſe contres, & with
ſuche ſūmes of money he entertayned as manye horſemen,
and fotemen, as he coulde gette beinge well furniſhed
and exerciſed in armes, & giuing great entertainement

the beſte ſouldiours therof came vnto him, in ſuch ſorte
that within a ſhorte ſpace, he had vnder his ledinge a
mightye armie bothe of horſemen and fotemen, able to
encountre anye prince, when Baiazithe vnderſtode or
thys he was muche offendyd and althoughe be coulde
when it pleaſed him, flater them, yet for all that, it was
a grefe to him to vſe hys force againſt his ſonne, and to

his great corteſie and humanitie, ſoughte by al meanes
poſſyble to remoue his ſonne from his lewde, and audacious
enterpriſe, but all was in vaine, for Selim wolde
not harcken to anye thinge that was ſpoken, but contynually
encreaſed his power,Baiazithe departeth from Andrinople. whervpon Baiazithe iudginge
Andrinople not to be a mete place for hys purpoſe,
thoughte it good to goe to ſuche a place where he wolde
not be enforced to fyghte but yt he wolde be at his choiſe
whervpō he departed from Andrinople with hys courſe
and all his power both of horſemen and fotemen, & toke
the waye towarde Conſtantinople, thickinge that beinge
there he moughte vſe the matter as he lyſted when
Selim vnderſtode of the departure of his father, he difſerrid
not the tyme but marched forthe with all his power,
leuinge his cariage and bagage behinde him in his
campe, and with great ſpede marched towarde Andrinople
to ouergette his father, and he paſſed on with ſuche
ſpede that he ouergate the rere garde of his fathers armie
within l. miles of Cōſtantinople, and finding them
in battayle, withoute ſendinge of heralde, trompett, or
anye other meſſager deferred no tyme, but charged them
and began to ioyne in battaile, and to laie hands aboute
him, when Baiazithe behelde the furie of his ſonne executed
cuted vpon his people as yf they had ben his naturall
enemyes, yet coulde he not be contented to vſe his force

ende when Baiazithe ſawe that he coulde by no meanes

appeaſe him but ye ſtill he perſeuered in his beaſtly rage
againſt him, he layd a parte all reſpectes, and alſo his fa

ſuſpecting ye ambition and crueltie of Selim, diſguiſed

foure galleys of his to attende vpon him home, and in

made great preparation in Conſtantinople, and put to
the ſea manye galleys, and Palandres, rychely furniſhed
and trymmed, to ſend into Turckie to tranſporte

of the Gianizzaries not beinge wyllinge to accepte
Acomathe for their lorde, for that he ſemed vnto

their ſayles and helmes, bycauſe they ſhoulde not
be able to ſayle, and in this greate ſturre & trouble their

is called Saincte dimetrio and came to the gate and called,

comme and kiſſe his fathers fete, Baiazithe vſed al mea

and in the ende offered them an infinite ſumme of
money, yf they wolde agree and conſent that Acomathe
ſhoulde be coroned, and ſeinge that he coulde by no mea

ſignifyed vnto him that he wolde not take him onelye
for his father, but alſo for his lorde, deſiringe him not to

was no meanes to altere that that was done, and that
yf he ſholde not willingly cōſent there vnto, he mought
ſone be enforced to doe it, whervpon he graunted his requeſt

great conference togither, Baiazithe required Selim to

                  WHEN ACOMATHE VNDERSTODE
of the comming of his brother Selim to
Conſtantinople, & in what ſorte thinges
had paſſed there, he thoughte not hym
ſelfe ſuer at Scutaro, whervpon he departed
from thence to Burſia, and when he
vnderſtode of the deathe of his father, he departed from
thence with his armie that he had in Natolia, towarde
Capadotia, and when he came thyther, he went nere to
the mounte Tauro, into that parte that Caromano had
poſſeſſed, and fortifyed hym ſelfe at the fote of mounts
Tauro, with great rampares, depe Dykes & artillerye
& the place of it ſelfe beinge ſtronge he had made it inprenable
and had furniſhed it plentifully with victualls
and all other kynde of neceſſaries in ſuche ſorte that he
moughte or a longe tyme lye ſafely there, whervpon, for
aſmuche as he ſawe him ſelfe ſuerly encamped, & that
Selim coulde not enforce him to battayle onles he lyſte
he determyned not to goe forthe of his campe for any occaſyon
that ſhoulde be offered him, but to lye ſtyll there
and to ſe what tyme wolde doe, perſwadinge him ſelfe
that god wolde not permitte amongeſte men, ſuche an
one longe to enioye an aſtate wone ſo wickedly, on the
other ſyde when Selim had poſſeſſed his fathers treaſure,
whiche was thought to be innumerable, he diſtributed
a great parte therof to the Gianizzaries, and to ye
reſte of his men of warre towarde whome he vſed great
liberalitie, and gaue them excedinge largely, after that
he began to reforme theordynances of his predeceſſours
as touching his men of warre, and gaue them to vnder
ſtande that their great brauerie was to no purpoſe for
it behoued good ſouldiours to prouide to couer them ſelues,
and their horſes with good and ſuer armour that
beinge ſuerly armed they moughte hazarde them ſelues
into greater peryll and fyghte the more valantly, and
not encorage the enemye to enforce them ſelues to all

peryll, for the gaine of the golde, Iuelles, and ſyluer, ye
they dyd weare vpon them. After this he eſtabliſhed his
countrey of Gretia, and then paſſed the ſtraite with his
armie into Bithinia, and then into licaonia and Capadotia
meaninge firſte to take awaye that impediment,
his brother Acomathe, and broughte his armie and encamped
not far from his brothers campe, the nexte day
he lefte his campe, and with his people toke the feelde,
and put them in battayle, redie to fyghte. But for all
this Acomathe wolde not once ſturre nor ſuffer one of
his ſouldiours to goe forthe of his campe, when Selim
had conſumed there a great time in vaine and coulde by
no maner of Iniurie procure him to the battayle, althoughe
he had vſed all meanes poſſyble that moughte
prouoque him their vnto, and in the ende ſeinge that he
coulde by no meanes cauſe him to accepte the battayle,
and that it was not poſſyble to enforce him to it, he was
ſorte that he had loſte ſo muche tyme, and determyned
to deferre the enterpriſe to an other tyme, wherfore he
raiſed his campe and toke the way towarde the ſea and
from thence into Magneſia to deale wt his brother Corcuthe
who contynued in Magneſia, and beinge a man of
uo trauayle nor vnderſtandinge of the warres, nor had
in the tyme of his father, nor afterwarde taken in hand
anye great enterpriſe, and miſtruſting nothinge, was
taken vnprouided withoute garde,Symplicitie of Corcuthe. but Selim determyninge
to diſpatche all thoſe of his bloude, and to raigne
withoute ſuſpition rode on with ſuch ſpede that he was
entred the confines of Magneſia, or that Corcuthe had
intelligence therof, or of his comminge at all, whervpon
Corcuthe ſeinge him to come with ſo great furie and
hauinge no preparation wherwith he moughte encounter
him, he determyned to ſe yf ye he moughte by flighte
ſaue his lyfe wherfore he diſguiſed him ſelfe, and with
certaine ye he moſte truſted he departed ſecretly oute of
the towne, and toke the waye towarde & hodes, & when
he came to the paſſage he founde it, with all ye ſea coaſte
occupied with the galleys and fuſtes of Selim, and whē
he ſawe no meanes howe to gette oute of the countre,
he determyned to hide him in certaine woedes there at

hand, and when he had contynued there in caues for a
certaine tyme and lyued of wylde hony, and rootes, Selim
promiſed openly to gyue great rewarde, to whomſo
euer wold giue him knowledge where he was, or els de
lyuer him into his hands, in the ende he was diſcouered
by certayne men of the countre who aduertyſed Selim
of him whervpon he ſent to take him,The death of Corcuthe. and as they were
bringinge of him towarde the towne, he was vpon the
waye by the commaundement of Selim, put to deathe
when Selim was in this ſorte poſſeſſid of Magneſia and
of all the prouinces of ye leſſer Aſia which lye alonge the
ſea coaſte euē to Soria, and had eſtabliſhed the goueren
ment therof, he broughte his armie to Burſia, and when
he was entred into Cilicia in great triumphe, he determyned
to get into his hands certaine yonge men, ſōnes
of two of his brethren that were dead, which Baiazithe
there grandfather had in his lyfe ſent thyther to be nori
ſhed and broughte vp, whervpon, he ordayned to celebrate
a maruelouſe ſumptuouſe feaſte to his Captaines
acording to the Turckiſhe maner, and to dyuerſe other
inhabitantes there, amonge whom he cauſed to conuite
his Nephewes, and when the feaſte was endyd he licen
ſed all men ſauinge his Nephewes,Barbarque crueltie. with whom he declared
that he wolde ſpeake, and cauſed them to be put
into ſondrie chambres, and then by his Mymſtres cauſed
them moſt cruelly to be ſtrangled, in ſuche ſorte that
of the plentyfull yſſue that Baiazithe lefte behinde him
their reſted none leuinge but onelye a ſonne of his, and
his brother Acomathe, with two ſonnes of his, whoſe
deathe he dyd contynually bothe daye and nighte frame
when he had appointed the gouernement of Burſia, he
went to Niconedia and from thence to the Golfe and finding
his Nauie there, embarcked him ſelfe with his people
and paſſed alonge the coaſte of Propontide, ſailinge
directly to Conſtantinople, and landinge at the ſteres
there he toke his horſe and rode throughe all the Citie
and then lyghted at his palace at Sainct Dimetrio his
ponte, and beinge there, diſcourſed maruelouſly in him
ſelfe of the order howe to ouerthrowe his brother Acomathe,
and knowinge, that yf he wolde contynue in his

campe, it was ſo ſtronge as it was not poſſible to plucke
him oute of hit, wherfore he determined to ſe if he could
by anye meanes betraie him,Selim practiſethe to betraye his brother Acomathe whervpon he entred into
practize with the Agar of the Gianizzaries and two of
his cheife Baſcias, & brought to paſſe that they ſhoulde
enter into practizo ſecretly with Acomathe, and declare
vnto him that they were not contented with the gouernance
of Selim, wherfore they wolde take parte wyth
him, and helpe him to recouer his ſtate and promiſed to
helpe him by all meanes poſſyble, and ſent to him ſecret
ly by certaine of their truſtie fryndes, that conſideringe
the vnſpeakeable crueltie that Selim had vſed, both toward
his father, Corcuthe, and his Nephewes, they dyd
deteſte and abhore him, and by meanes of his great inſolence
and tiranie that he vſed in his gouernance they
were ſuer nether of their goodes, ne yet of their lyues, &
that they dyd repent that auer they created him Emperour,
and alſo yf he wolde comme and take their parte,
they wolde cut him in peces and delyuer them ſelues of
his moſte intollerable ſeruitude and therfore whenſoeuer
that they ſhoulde vnderſtande that he wolde cōme
forewarde with his armie to Burſia, that immediatly
thervpon they wolde ether cut him in peces, or els rebelle
openly againſt him, and leue him, and comme and
ioyne their powers with him and whē they had in this
ſorte accepted him for their lorde, they wolde then acompanie
him to Conſtantinople to place him in the Imperiall
ſeate, & they exhorted him therfore, not to loſe, ſuche
an occaſion, for as ſone as they ſhoulde vnderſtand that
he was entred into Bithinia, all the Gianizzaries and
horſemen wolde for the with rebelle, and ſtey Selim, and
comme to him and accepte him for their lord, when Acomathe
had receaued this meſſage, he doubted in the begynninge,
of their faithe, ſuſpectinge them to be but
intiſinges to cauſe him to leue his ſtrengthe, & to betray
him, wherfore he gaue ſmale eare, & weid it not at all,
but they contynuinge ſtyll in ſendinge their meſſages,
dyd ſo vrge, and importue him, requirynge of him nothinge,
but to comme to the feelde with his armie, and
ſhewed him the order howe they wolde bringe it it paſſe

wythoute anye peryll, and in the ende perſwaded him to
accepte their offer, and yet he ſuſpected the matter euen
as it came to paſſe, and determyned to goe no further
then to Burſia, whervpon he promiſed them to comme
meaning not to depart from Burſia vntyl that he herde
that the Gianizzaries, and horſemen, had taken their
armes, and reuolted openly againſt Selim in Conſtantinople,
& to this intent he departed from his lodginges
and marched with his armie directly towarde Burſia,
Selim on the other ſide had contynual ſpyalle vpon Acomathe,
and was from tyme aduertized of his procedings
as ſone as he had in telligence that he was marchinge
and drewe neare the confynes of Bithinia, he ordained
to make redie his people ſecretly, and paſſed them in the
nighte with great ſylence into Turchie, and rode on wt
all ſpede the neareſt waye towarde Burſia, and when
he came vpon the plaine of Burſia, he mette with Acomathe
and his armie not far from the towne, and
aſſayled hym with greate furye, charginge him in
ſuche ſorte,Battayle betwene Selim & Acomathe that hys force was ſuche, that the ſoul
diours of Acomathe not beinge able to endure them,
were in the fyrſte encounter dyſordred, and put to
flyghte, and beynge folowed by the horſemen of Selim
the greateſte parte of them were taken and
ſlayne, and Acomathe, hauynge hys horſe ſtayne
vuder hym, and lyinge vpon hym on the grounde
coulde not ſhyfte hym ſelfe from hym, and beynge
enuironned wyth a greate number of enemyes was
taken, he deſyred to be broughte to the preſence of
hys brother, and as he was on hys waye goynge
towarde him, there mette hym, certayne that were
ſent from Selim, whyche ſtayed hym, and ſtrangled
hym moſte miſerably, Acomathe broughte to
the feelde wyth hym two ſonnes, Amorathe, and
Aladino, whyche in the rencountre that they had
wyth Selim, as ſone as they ſawe theyr people begin to
recule, in ye begining of the battaile, conueid thē ſelues
away, & wolde not come in hys handes, but toke ſondrie

wayes, the one of them fled into Perſia to the Sophie,
who entertained him honorably and gaue him great prouiſion,
and a wyfe, thinckinge to ayde him againſt Selim,
but in the ende he became ſo inſolente, that he was
in tollerable, wherfore he put him to deathe, the other
toke his waie alonge the ſea coaſte and paſſed into Sorta
and came to Cairo, and Selim after this great victorie
had againſt his brother hauinge taken awaye all occasi
ones of Cyuyll warres retorned into Gretia, & hauing
determyned in his mynde a iorney againſt the Sophie
and coulde not endure that he ſhoulde enioye a number
of townes in the leſſer Armenia, whiche were wonte to
be gouerned by the princes of the Turckiſhe nation, and
beſyde that, that he ſhoulde enlarge his dominiones euē

thoſe people, for ſo muche, that the greateſt number of
them were infected with the ſuperſtition or hereſie, y•
the Sophie is, beinge deuided from the reſte of the Mahometiſtes
into a peculier ſecte, alſo he wolde not that the
ſubieces of the Sophie ſhoulde trauaile into his countre
nor traffique anye more with his people, and when he
had areſted all the ſylkes, and goodes, of ye marchantes
that were ſubiectes to the Sophie, whiche dwelledin

to ſhowe them howe to vſe their weapones and knowinge
that his enemie was nothinge ſo well furniſhed wt

that his father lefte, and to make it, into ſuche peces as
moughte more eaſyly be caried and lyke vnto ye whiche

that ye paſſage of his victualles ſhoulde be free without

at that tyme Selim was contented to accepte,
bicauſe that he coulde obtaine none other, and to auoide
the loſſe of tyme dyd not meane as then to take the coū

manye places of greate force, both naturall, and
artificiall and excedingly well furniſhed both with men

of his owne ſubiectes armed, thirtie thouſande men on
horſebacke whervpon when the conditiones were artified,
and othe gyuen on bothe ſydes for the performance
of the ſame, he marched with his armie to the floode Euphrates,
then faſtenned he his botes frō the one bancke
to the other of the ſame, and layd his brydge vpon them

when then Sophie was aduertized of the aryuall of the
Turckes armie he deferred no tyme but toke hys horſe
and marched with his armie toward the ryuer Euphrates
to encountre Selim, and mete with him in the myddeſte

of the plaine one this ſyde of ye Citie Tauris foure
dayes lorney,The battayle betwene the Sophie & Selim. and withoute any delate, put their people
in order and then came on with great furie, and ioyned
in battayle, the fyghte was terrible and bloudie, it contynued
longe in good order, withoute anye aduaūtage
ſeen of other ſyde, but at the laſte the Perſians ſerring
them ſelues and comminge on hauynge their horſes of
more force, and better armed then the Turckes horſes
were, began to preuaile, whiche when Selim perceued
he cauſed his ſquadrone to open, and to ſuffer the Perſianes
to paſſe al moſt into the myddeſt of the ſquadrone
and when they came there, he cauſed vpon the ſodden to
diſcharge certaine peres of artillerie whiche he had placed
in ye myddeſt of his ſquadrone, which made ſo great
anoyſe that the aire dyd ringe, and the earthe dyd ſhake
with it, and hauing ſtayne in the diſcharge of that volee
an excedinge great number of men & horſes, it ſo feared
the reſt of the horſes whiche were not vſed to thondringe
and noyſe of artillerie, that they ran awaie, and
ſcattered all ouer the feelde, and they ye rode them were
not able to gouerne them, when the Turckes horſemen
ſawe their enemies flee in that ſorte, they folowed them
with all ſpede poſſyble, and when they ouergate them,
they ſlewe and toke an infinite number of them, ye roſte
fled euery man his waye, and ſuffred there enemyes to

lerie the Sophie, with a great number of his nobilitie,
with drewe them ſelues,Selim, of great iudgment. ſeinge their people in ſo great
diſorder, Selim determyninge to vſe the victorie, lodged
his armie that nighte, where the Perſianes lodged
the nighte before, and gaue al the ſpoyle of their campe
to his ſouldiours. The next morning as ſone as it was
day, he toke his horſe and rode towarde the citie Tauris
and when he was comme neare vnto it, the Citizens being
diſcoraged throughe the ouerthrowe of their prince
and ſeinge no man to apeare vpon the feelde in their defence,
wolde not by defendinge them ſelues hazaro both
their lyues and goodes, determyned amonge them to
yelde the citie, whervpon they ſent forthe certaine of
their Citizens to talke with Selim, and in the ende agreed

to delyuer hym the Citie, ſauinge their lyues and
goodes, when this was agreed, they receaued him into
the towne and his people alſo, and there is no doubte,
but yf that Selim had had prouiſion in Tauris for the
ſuſtenance of his armie,Tauris yelded to Selim. but that he ſhoulde eaſyly haue
poſſeſſed the kingedome of Perſia, and baniſhed the Sophie
the countre, but he had ſone conſumed all the countre
and prouiſyon that there was, and on the other ſyde
the princo of Adule, as ſone as he vnderſtode that ye Sophie
had his armye vpon the feelde, Iudginge that he
ſholde haue the better, brake his promes with him, and
toke the feelde with his armye & occupied al the ſtraites
and paſſages, by the which men muſt paſſe, oute of the
Turckes dominions into Perſia, and toke from all the
victuallers that came,Great ertremitie. their victualles, & warned them,
that from thence forthe they ſhoulde no more cōme there
whereof it folowed, that hauing conſumed the victualles
whiche they founde there, and hauing no releefe oute of
their countre, they were brought into great penurie, &
intollerable famine, in ſuch ſorte, as they were enforced
to ſtey their horſes, and eate them, aud alſo to eare both
rootes and herbbes that were vnholeſome for man to
eate, by meanes wherof: they were not onelye vnable to
folowe the victorie againſt ye Perſians, but alſo to ſtand
vpon their feete, throughe the which incommoditie Selim
beinge excedingly afflicted, and ſeing his people daily
to conſume, with the great loſſe of horſes alſo that he
had, and ſeing no way howe to remedie this miſchefe, being
of neceſſitye conſtrayned, he determyned to put of
this enterprſe and to retorne into his countre meaning
(that when he had aſſured him ſelfe of the paſſages, and
made better prouiſyon) to retorne thyther againe ye yere
folowinge and to renewe the warres, and when he had
taken oute of Tauris a great number of the cheife Citizens,
with their whole families and ſubſtanes, and alſo
all ſuche as coulde make armour, he ſent them to Conſtātinople
and departed with his armye oute of Tauris
and paſſed the ryuer Euphrates, and detormyning ſome
what to recreate his afflicted armie he aſſayled ye towne
of Maſcuall and toke it of force & gaue it in proie to his

ſouldiours, and in this ſorte contynuinge his voyage by
ſmale and eaſye iorneys, for that manye of his horſes
were ſo feble that they coulde ſcareſely goe he broughte
his armie into Licaonia, and ſent them to garniſones
into ye countre aboute Iconio, at this day called Cogni,
ſo ſpoyled that they ſhowed them ſelues not onelye, not
victoriouſe, but rather defeicted ouerthrowen, & ſpoyled
when Selim had in this ſorte placed his people in garninifones,
he then ſoughte howe to ſupplie and furniſhe
them againe whervpon he made a reuewe of his armys
and ſent into Gretia all thoſe that had endured and ſuffred
moſt miſerie, to reliue them ſelues, and cauſed newe
and freſhe men to be ſent in their places, and the Sophie
beinge vpon the conſynes of Perſia, and hauinge intelligence
of the departure of Selim from Tauris, was ſo
diſcouraged, that he durſte not deale with him, by meanes
of the ouerthrowe which he had receaueo, and alſo
the feare that he had of the artillerie,Nota. and cheifely for ye
that he had loſte ye greateſt nūber of his olde ſouldiours
he durſte not attempte anye further, Selim determined
to be reuenged of the wronge, that the prince of Adula
had done him and alſo to aſſure him ſelfe of the paſſages
wherefore he ſent Sinan Baſſa with a great number of
horſemen and fotemen to ſpoyle his countre,Battayle betwene the prince of Adula & Synan Baſſa. & as ſone
as he came into his countre, the prince encountred with
him and after longe fyghte was taken by him and al his
people ouerthrowen, whervpon he poſſeſſed all the ſtate
that he had in the mountaines and ſent him priſoner to
Selim, who cauſed to ſtryke of his head and to ſett it on
the pointe of a launce, and then ſent it to be ſhowed in euery
place throughe oute his countrey in token of victorie,
he then beinge whollye occupied in makinge his
prouiſyon of men bothe on horſebacke and fote, of money
and other monition which he ment to vſe in his enterpriſe
that he determyned to take in hand the ſpringe
nerte folowing, callinge oute of Aſia and Europe, all
ſuch of his ſubiectes as had ben wel trained in ye warres
and had determyned to winter at Iconio, for ye he wolde
be at hand to take in hande againe the enterpriſe in the
ſpringe folowing, the Gianizzaries beinge determined

to goe home into Gretia, went vnto him and when they
ſawe that they coulde not perſwade hym to paſſe into
Gretia for that winter,Muting of the Gianizzaries. they began to threaten him, and
declared vnto him, that yf he wolde not goe with them,
they wolde them ſelues goe, and when they came there
they wolde ſwere obedience to his ſōne, with the which
wordes, Selim was marueiouſly troubled, and began
to ſuſpecte, and the nighte folowing diſguiſed him ſelfe
and with certaine of his familiers with him, toke the
poſte, and ran daye and nighte vntyll he came to Scuta
ro, and paſſed ye ſtraite and diſcouered him ſelfe to none,
vntyl he came within his Seraglio: where he continued
three dayes and wolde gyue audience to noe man and in
the ende beinge enforced by Pernio Baſcia and ye Cadi
to declare the cauſe of his great melancholie, anſwered
that he was no more an Emperour, for ſo muche as the
Gianizzaries wolde haue enforced him, whervpon they
deſyred him to be of good chere, and declared vnto hym
that he ſhoulde haue good meanes to puniſhed them and
to be reuenged vpon them for their rebellion, and when
they vnderſtode of him, the cheife auctours of this diſorder,
they wrote to all the bandes of the Gianizzaries in
generall, and gaue them to vnderſtande the whole matter,
and the auctours of the diſorder alſo, whervpō they
ſo ſturred them vp, that ſoddenly they toke their weapones,
and then laide hande of thoſe whiche began this
matter, and broughte them in cheynes to Conſtantinople,
and preſented them before the gates of the Serraglio,
and with lowd voice aſked pardone, puttinge the
whole defaute in their leaders, and delyuered them all
in cheynes, requiringe him to put them to deathe, in example,
to thoſe that ſhoulde come after them, Selim accepted
their exceuſe and pardoned them, and put to death
all the chiefe of the ſedition, which ſeueritie wroughte
ſo great terrour, that Solimano his ſonne, fcaring leſte
his father ſhoulde haue him in any ſoſpition by meanes
of the wordes of the Gianizzaries, went to kyſſe his fathers
fete, being moruelouſly affraied, and excuſed hys
innocentie, when Selim had lefte his frontiers of Europe
well garded, and had prouided hoth men, and money

for his iorney, he retorned againe to Icomo to hys
garniſones. In this meane time the Sophie ſent his ant
baſſodours to ye Soldan for aide, declaring vnto him the
great peryll wherin he was, & praied him that he wolde
haue regarde to their comon welthe, and ſend his armie
to vnite with him. The Soldane was maruelouſty moued
by the perſwationes of the Perſianes,greate fore ſyghte of the Soldane. and vnderſtandinge
the great confuſion and diſorder into ye which
the Sophie was broughte, with all his countre of Perſia,
& fearinge leſte that he, beinge thus affraied ſhoulde
ſeke ſuche peace at the handes of Selim as he moughte
obtaine, and that when the Turckes had broughte the
Sophie vnder fote, they ſhoulde employe their whole
force againſt Soria, whervpon he gaue them to vnderſtande
that he wolde in no wyſe fayle them but wolde
for their welthe hazarde, bothe his perſon and al that he
had els, and that they ſhoudle wyll their prince to be of
good cheare, and as ſone as the ſpringe ſhoulde comme
on he wolde in perſon, with all his power of Mamalukes
and other ſouldiours that he coulde make, deſcend
into Soria, to vnite his force with his, to the ende, that
when they had had vnited their forces, they mought prenente
the enemye and goe to ſeeke him and make the
warres at his owne dore, and for that ye Soldane wolde
detract no time he began immediatly to leuie his bands
and gather his armye, and to make redie for ye enterpriſe
on the other ſide when Selim retorned to his garniſions
he began to ſupplie his bandes with freſhe ſouldiours,
and to ſee them thorowlie furniſhed with money and al
other neceſſaries, and as ſone as the ſpringe of the yere
tame he aſſembled his armye, and put to the feelde marthing
towarde the mounte Taurs: to paſſe into Armenia
and as he approched neare the mountayne, he had
aduertizement that the Soldan was departed from Cai
ro with all his ordinarie bandes, and a great number of
Arabianes, and came downe into Soria to ayde the Sophie,
and to vnite his force with him, wherupon he cauſed
to ſtate the marche, and then called to councell hys
Baſcias and other Captaines, declaringe vnto them ye
comminge of the Soldane into Soria, and when they

had thorowlye diſcourſed of the matter what was to be
done therin, they allowed the opinion of Selim, whiche
was to preueut the enemyes,Rype iudgment of Selim. and not to ſuffer them to
vnite their forces, but to goe and encountre the one of
them, Iudginge it more eaſye to ouerthrowe one, then
bothe their powers beinge once vnited, and diſcourſing
in him ſelfe which of them it were better fyrſt to aſſayls
he thoughte the enterpriſe againſte the Soldane moſtemete,
and eaſyer then it of Perſia againſt the Sophie,
for that the Soldane beinge an olde man, and not trayned
in the warres, was more weake, and for that his armye
had ben a longe tyme at reſte, and had dealed wyth
no enemye of great experience in warres, but that their
name was feared in all y• eaſte, for ye actes which thye &
their predeceſſours had done in time paſt, & being in this
ſort perſuaded, he determined the enterpriſe againſt the
Soldane, & marched wt his armie a long by the fote of the
mounte Tauro holdinge the waye of the righte hand &
ſo paſſed into Cilicia: where he vnderſtode that the Soldane
had entertained in his paie a great number of Arrabianes,
and that he was entred into Soria wyth, xv.
thouſand Mamalukes comming towarde Aleppo, wher
vpon he made the greater haſte and went towardes him
and when he came neare to Aleppo he vnderſtode that ye
Soldane was encamped vpon the ryuer of Singa tenmyles
from that place, whervpon, he put hys people in
battayle, and marched on toward the enemie with great
furie, and when he came within ſyghte of them, he foude
that the Soldane began to diſiodge and to take ye feelde
puttinge his people in order in the myddeſt of the feelde
declaring him ſelfe redie to the battaile,The battayle betwene Selim & the Soldane. whervpon withoute
delaie they ioyned in battayle, and there began a very
braue, and bloudie fyghte, and it contynued a greate
pece of the daye withoute anye aduantage of eyther ſide
but at the laſte a certayne number of the Mamalukes
marched on ſo cloſely in order that they were as ſtronge
as a mightie walle, and charged the Turckes with ſuch
force, that they not beyng able to endure the force and
power of the Mamalukes and their horſes, were enforced
to diſorder and breake their ranckes and by meanes

therof: gaue them waye to enter their ſquadrone, & when
they were comme to the Gianizzaries, they diſordered
them alſo, and paſſed on vntyll they came to their enſeig
nes where the Turcke was in perſon, and he ſeinge his
people thus in diſorder, and that there was no meanes
to holde them togyther and to kepe them in order, he cō
               maunded
his maiſter Cannoniers to diſcharge all their
artillerie at one Inſtante vpon them, the noyſe of the artillerie
was ſuche, that the horſes of the Mamalukes
coulde not endure it, but retorned backe and ran awaye
ſcattering all ouer the feelde in diſpite of thoſe that rode
them, and thus by flighte, lefte vnto their enemyes that
victorie, which they had all redie in their handes, they
had not loſte of their people before the diſcharge of that
volee of ſhotte, ſcarcely one thouſand. The ſouldiours
of Scilin, ſeinge the flyghte of their enemyes began to
encorage them ſelues, and folowed them, making great
flaughter of them. The Soldane behaued him ſelfe that
daye lyke a worthie man, and dyd not omitte any thing
that appertained to a worthy Captaine, and had ſondrie
tymes that daye, ſupplied with great diſcreſſion where
nede was, and where his people were in diſorder and began
to flee, whervpon he was enforced to vſe both ſayre
wordes, pro meſſes and threatinges & by theſe meanes
had dyuerſe tymes that day ſtaied them from roning awaye
and putting them in order agayne ſoughte to renewe
the fyghte, but he founde them ſo amaſed & ſtonied
by meanes of the noyſe of the artillerie, to the whiche
they were not acuſtomed, that they (lainge a ſyde all reuereuce)
dyd not once hercken to any worde ye he ſpeake
but contynued ſtyll their flyghte, and diſorder, and when
the Soldane ſawe that he was lefte of his ſouldiours,
and alone vpon the feelde, he wolde not comme on lyue
into the handes of his enemyes wherfore he folowinge
after his people, ſoughte to ſaue him ſelfe by flighte
but being ercedingly hote and faintie in his armour, for
ſo much as he had taken vpon him ye day great trauaile,
and had continued the hole day on horſebacke, withoute
receauing meate or dryncke, in the ende beinge vtterly
weried, and with the force of the preſſe of thoſe ye came

after him, who being ſo affraied that they flede continually
in a confuſed ſorte, hauing no regarde to their duetye,
but euery man made ſhyſte for one, & amonge them
he was ouerthrowen both horſe and man, and beings
once downe, being an aged man, & his armour of great
weyghte,The death of Campſone Cairo Soldane of Babilone. he coulde no more ryſe, and hauinge loſte hys
force & ſenſſes, gaue vp his ſpirite amonges their horſes
fete, and this was the end of Campſone Cairo Soldane
of Babilone, a noble perſonage, and of greate vertue,
who founde the kingdome of Egipte, and Soria, ſo conſumed
and ſpoyled, by cyuyll diſſention, and warres, y•
in ſhorte tyme their were ſtaine amonge them ſelues in
theſe eſmotiones, foure Soldanes, when this man had
accepted the gouernance, he ſo reformed it, by his great
wyſdome and Iuſtice, encreaſyng it both with reputation,
and obedience, in ſuch ſorte, that he brought it to an
exceding great quietnes and tranquilitie, ſo that for y•
ſpace of .xvi. yeres, wherein he had gouerned, they had
not onely, not experimented what the warres were, but
alſo not herde them once named amonge them: in all y•
kingdome of Egipte, and Soria. After this when the
nighte came, the enemyes fled faſte towarde Aleppo, &
lefte the feelde, and alſo their campe withoute defence,
in proie to the enemies, but Selim miſtruſting ye fyneſſe
of the Mamalukes, wolde not that nyghte enter into
their campe, but encampted where the battayle was
ſoughte,Selim an excelent Captaine. and helde a great pece of his armye all y• nyght
in battayle, and when it was day he ſent certaine vante
corriers to vewe the campe of the enemyes, who fynding
it withoute defendantes, gaue ſuche aduertizemēt
whervpon Selim marched with his armye and entred y•
campe, and founde the lodginges of the Soldane full of
riches and gaue it in proie to his ſouldiours, and when
he vnderſtode that Gazzele, with the reſt of ye Soldanes
Captaines, were departed from Aleppo in the fourthe
watche, and gone to Dammaſco, he marched on to Aleppo,
and when he came thyther, Caſerbeio, whiche was
gouernour there for the Soldane, withoute making any
reſyſtance at all, went forth to hym and yelded hym the
towne, and being maruelouſly embraced and honoured

by Selim, confyrmed the opinion of many, which was ye
he had alwaye ben a traitour to the Soldane, and had in
telligence with Selim, and alſo that he had aduertized
him of the comming of the Soldane into Soria, and exhorted
him to leue the enterpriſe of Perſta, and to take
in hand that of Soria againſt the Soldane, when Selim
was entred into Aleppo, he graunted ye Citizens many
liberties, and being greatly oppreſſyd by the impoſitiones
and taxes which the Soldane laid vpon them, he
meaning to gratifie them, and to preſerue the great traffique,
and encourage the marchantes that there were &
others alſo to comme thyther with their marchandize,
he releaſed dyuerſe of the impoſitiones, and alſo diminiſhed
a parte of the cuſtumes of the marchandize, & when
he had contynued there certaine dayes, he receaued aduertizement,
that all the Mamalukes that were lefte liuing
at the ouerthrowe of Aleppo, with Gazzele which
was ye cheife Captaine amonge them then (conſidering
that the lorde of Damaſco was ſlayne in the battayle)
were determyned to goe and to create a newe Soldane
whervpon they departed from Soria and rode towarde
Cairo, Selim departed from Aleppo and marched on to
warde Damaſco, and when he was comme before the
Citie with hys armye, they of the Citie thought it not
good by reſyſtance, to put bothe them ſelues and y• they
had in peryll, whervpon they ſent forth to Selim Oratours,
and graunted him the Citie, vpon condittion to
enioye: bothe their lyues and goodes, when Selim had
accepted their offer, he entred into the Citie beinge accompained
onely with his garde, leuinge all the reſt of
his armye withoute in campe, bycauſe the Citie ſhoulde
not by moleſted, nor greued, nor the ſtraunge marchantes
that there were oute of all partes of the worlde, the
Cities of Soria, which ſtande vpon the ſea coaſte folowed
the example of Aleppo and Damaſco, and the principall
of them were, Tripolli, Sindonia, Baruti, and
Tolemarde, which yeldyd, and receaued dyuerſe bandes
of the Soldiers of Selim into them, Selim determyniing
to eſtabliſhe the gouernement of Soria, called a coū
cell in Damaſco, and thyther came meſſagers oute of al

the cities and townes of the prouince, and he ſate in the
myddeſt of the market place, with dyuerſe graue and diſcrete
councellours aboute him whiche he vſed alwaye
when he gaue audience openly, and there he herds, and
determyned many controuerſies, and when he had appointed
gouernours and officers to euery towne and citie,
and had aboliſhed dyuerſe of the cuſtumes of the ancient
Soldanes as vniuſte, and intollerable to the people,
he dyd moderate them with newe lawes, and when
he had contynued in Damaſco a longe tyme aboute the
reforming of the countre, and had well repoſed his armye,
he then determyned in him ſelfe to make warres a
gainſt Egipte, for ſo muche as he vnderſtode that al the
Mamalukes that were diſperſed abrode into al the coū
               tres,
were comme to Cairo to create a newe Soldane, &
beinge once togyther, they choſe Tomombeio the great
Diadaro,Tomombeio elected Soldane a man of great reputation and credite, and of
great experience, and excellent, in the diſcipline of the
warres, Selim being vpon the pointe of his departure,
ſent before him to make ſuer the waye Sinan Baſſa, &
gaue him in commiſſyon to paſſe on to the Citie Gaza,
and there to tarie hym, and he in perſon departed from
Damaſco with the reſte of his armie and folowed, and beinge
deſyrous to viſyte that moſt famous temple of Ike
ruſalem, toke with him his garde of Gianizzaries and a
certaine number of his horſemen and entred into Iudea
and paſſed on to Iheruſalem, and when he had viſyted ye
temple, and other holly places of the Citie, he retorned
agayne to his armye the nexte waye. And Sinan Baſſa
with his companie which was .xv. thouſand horſemen
hauinge ouerthrowen the Arabianes and repulſed their
inuaſyones whiche often tymes they had attempted againſt
him, and had made the paſſage free with much a
doe, and was comme on to Gaza, which ſtode neare vnto
the ſea vpō the confynes of Egipte in ye place, where
men enter into the ſandie deſerte paſſinge from Iudea
to Eairo, and when he came before the Citie with his
armye, they of the Citie willinge to auoide the ſacke &
ſpoyle therof, gaue place to tyme, and yelded ye Citie vnto
him, where he contynued, and taried for commiſſyon

from his lorde to directe him in thoſe affaires. As ſone
as Tomombeio had receaued the gouernement, he determyned
forth with to ſupplie the bandes of Mamalukes
which were maruelouſly ſpoyled and conſumed, wherfore
he cauſed to enrolie all their ſlaues ye were of lawful

thoſe of Gaza (whiche dyd very well affecte the Mamalukes)
of the comminge of Sinan Baſſa, and in what

termyned to ſend a power to encountre him, hauinge
great hope in the good wyll of the Citizens, whervpon
he diſpatched Gazele,Sinan Baſſa a diſcrecie & worthye Captaine and ſent him with ſyre thouſande
horſes, and a greate number of Arabianes, and as ſone
as Sinan Baſſa was aduertized of his comming, by his
bandes that he had alwaie vpon the feelde, not truſting
them of the Citie, he determyned to goe againſt hym &
to encountre him, and when he had rydden xv. myles, he
ſtaied at a village where he mought well lodge, for
that that in the vilage their was a fountaine very plen
tuouſe of pure watter, whervpō he commaūded to lodge

ſcarcely tyme to put his people in order, before that Gazele
was cōme with his, & began to aſſayle his vantgard
and after that they had foughte a certaine ſpace, Gazele
ſeinge his peopble ouerlaide, with uumber, and a rtillerie,
and that they began to recule, and ſeing y• they

ayde he had taken in hand the battayle) with his ſworde
in his hand dyd make his waye thorowe his enemyes, &
ſo retorned to Cairo with the loſſe of his cariage, and a
great number of his ſouldiours, and when Selim was
departed from Iheruſalem he came to his armye, and

broughte them to Gaza, where he founde Sinan Baſſa
retorned with great victorie, and had put to deathe many
of ye Citizens which had procured ye Soldane to ſend
his people thyther, when Selim had repoſed his ſouldiours
for a tyme in Gaza, he determyned to marche on
towarde Cairo, and wolde not gyue the newe Soldane
time to furniſhe him ſelfe of newe bands and to put him
ſelfe in good order, wherfore he made great prouiſion of
hogges hedes to carie watter with him, and ſent Sinan
Baſſa before him with his bandes of Europe, and he folowed

and came neare to Cairo within fewe myles, a lytle frō
a villadge named Macharea, where the Soldane had a
garden, where that moſt precious licour called Balſme
dyd growe, which is a certaine goome, that diſtillethe
throughe certaine cleſtes made in the barcke of ye trees
in the tyme of the gathering therof, by the gardeners,
which cut them with exceding fyne knynes made of yuorie,
Tommobeio determyned to tarie the enemye in y•
village, whervpon he entrenched it very ſtongly wyth
great rampares, and depe Dykes, and had bent al his artillerie
vpon the waye where the Turcks ſhoulde cōme
and as ſone as he herde of the comminge of the Turckiſhe
armye he departed from Cairo with, twelue thou
ſand Mamalukes, and a great number of Arrabianes, &
other ſouldiours on horſebacke, and on fote, and came &
lodged in his lodginge that was fortified for him of purpoſe,
where, whē he had put his people in order he taried
the comming of the enemye, and as ſone as Selim vnderſtode
of the Soldanes order, he refuſed the waye that
the Soldane had bent all his artillerie vpon, and wolde
not aſſayle hys enemye vpon the frounte of his battaile
but determyned to aſſayle him on the flancke where he
was not ſo well prouided, whervpō he diſvanded agreat
nūber of ſhotte & ſent them to aſſayle the trenches of y•
Soldane, & immediatly the Soldane marched forthe wt
his people in order, and there began betwene them a notable
fyghte, and a furious, and hauing fought from the
fourthe houre of the daye, to the ſunne goinge downe

in very doubtfull ſorte, euen to the darcke nighte, Tommabeio
cauſed to ſounde the retreicte,The battayle betwene Selim & the Soldane. and lefte the village
and marched to Cairo and the Turckes as victoriouſe
entred into the Soldanes lodginges and their lodged
that nighte, there were ſlaine of ye partie of ye Mamalukes
the great Diadaro, ſtrycken with a falconete and
of the Turckes partie Sinan Baſſa,Two worthye captaines ſlayne- and when the Soldane
was retorned with his armys, he lodged them betwene
the Citie, and the ryuer Nilo, and determyned to
ſupplie his armye with newe bandes and to defend him
ſelfe, and therfore ſent for all the Mamalukes yt were appointed
to the garde of other contreys, and commaunded
them to repaire to Cairo with all ſpede, he toke oute of
the Monition houſe of the Caſtle, all the furniture of armour,
and weapon, that there was and diſtributed it to
the children of the Mamalukes and to twelue thouſand
ſlaues which they toke vp in that Citie, beſydes that he
ſent into Iudea and Arabia, his Captaines to leuie and
enrolle all ſuche horſemen and fotemen as they ſhoulde
fynde, that were trained, and experimented in ye warres
and for that he wolde as muche as in him was ſaue his
people from the force of the artillerie, he determyned wt
all his power to aſſayle his enemye in the darckeſt of ye
nighte, for that he was aſſured that in the nyghte they
coulde not well vſe their artillerie withoute the ſlaughter
of their owne people as well as of their enemyes, &
diſcouering his opinion to certaine of the cheife of ye Mamalukes,
he prouided to put it in executiō, but he coulde
not vſe the matter ſo ſecretly, but yt amonge thoſe fewe
with whom he had debated the cauſe, their were ſome
traitours whiche dyd aduertize Selim therof who cauſed
to make greate fyres withoute his campe rounde aboute
it, whiche made all the partes aboute the campe
to be as well ſeen as in the myddeſte of the daye, and in
this ſorte prouided that he moughte well vſe hys artillerie,
and then put hys armye in battayle lookinge for
his enemyes, Tommobeio in the nyght▪ approched neare
to the Turckes campe, and when he ſawe all theſe fires
he was then aſſured that hys enterpriſe was diſcouered
yet wolde be not ſo retorne, but aſſayled his trenches

in ſuche ſorte that he entred them and ſynding them very
well furniſhed be retorned agayne to his lodging frō
whence he came, and after that (beinge enforced by the
Mamalukes) he was conſtrained to lodge within the citie,
and to defende it, and for that he wolde prouide in euery
reſpecte, he cauſed with all ſpede to fortifye it and
when he had made ſtronge the principall places therof,Prouidēce of Selim.
he put ſtronge garde into them, Selim as ſone as he
herde that the Soldane with his armie was lodged wt in
the towne, he marched with his armye into the towne,
which he moughte eaſyly doe, for that the citie was not
enuironed with walle, nor rampare, beinge within the
Citie with his armye, he foughte three dayes continually,
with the enemye, and when he had ſlayne a great nū
               ber
of them he became lorde of the greateſt parte of the
Citie, and the Mamalukes ſeinge their force daily to de
caie, and that they were no longar able to contynue in
the Citie, went from thence to the ryuer Nilo and toke
the boates that they founde there, and paſſed all their armie
with the Soldane ouer the ryuer into the Region
Segeſta, which is a parte of Affrica that liethe towarde
Cirene, and Tomombeio for that he wolde not gyue ouer
the matter, ſent for thoſe Mamalukes that were appointed
to grade the Citie of Alexandria, and for y• there
came dayly into his campe, Arabianes, Affricanes, and
other Mores, of ye prouices there abouts, he began to be
agayne in good hope to defende his owne, whyleſt the
matters of Cairo paſſed in this ſorte Gazzele whome ye
Soldane had ſent into Thebaiade, to leuie as manye
bandes of both horſemen and fotemen as he coulde, was
cōme neare to Cairo and had brought with him a gerat
number of Arrabianes with their Captaines alſo, and
when he vnderſtode of the loſſe of Cairo, and that hys
lorde was fied beyonde the ryuer Nilo, and beinge oute
of all hope of the preſeruation of his countre vnder the
gouernement of the Soldane, ſeinge it paſte all remedie
determined to obſerue time and to pronide for his ſafety
by yelding him ſelfe to the victour, and when he had in
this ſorte debated the matter with the Captaines of the
Arrabianes, which he had brought with him, & had per

ſwaded them in that behalfe, he came to the gate of Selim
and required to be broughte to his preſence,Gazzele rendered him to Selim- & when
he came before him, he fell proſtrate to the grounde and
ryſſed his fete ſainge, for ſo muche as he had done for y•
preſeruation of the Mamalukes ſtate and of his lorde,
all that was poſſyble for him to doe, and neuer brake his

the preſeruation of this ſame, and nowe ſeinge his high
nes poſſeſſyd of the Citie, and placed in the Imperiall
ſeate, and his lorde to be fled and to haue lefte his kingdome,
wherfore he had determyned with him ſelfe no lenger
to reſpſte, but truſting in his clemencie, and goodnes
was cōme wholly to committe him ſelfe into his hands
wt oute any maner of condition at all, but to be well contentyd
with all that, that ſhoulde pleaſe his highnes to
deteremyne of him, Selim receuid him very corteouſly,
and willed him to be of good comforte and to aſſure him
ſelfe not to wante place with him mete for a man of his
worthines, he cauſed him to be writen amonge ye reſte
of his chiefe Captaines, & appointed vnto him an honorable,
prouiſionin lyke ſorte he cauſed ye Captaines &
chiefe officiers of the Arrabianes to be broughte vnto
him, and gaue them very good wordes, and entertained
them in his ordinarie. After this he vnderſtode of a certaine
man of Segeſta (which was comme to ſeke him)
of manye of the purpoſes of Tomombe is, and howe he
was contynually ſolycited by certaine Mores the principall,
and chiefe of Cairo, in ſuche ſorte as he was fully
determyned to retorne thyther agayne, when Selim vnderſtode
of theſe preparationes, he thought good to pre
uent it, whervpon he determined to paſſe the ryuer Nilo
and to ſeke him, and to the ende that he moughte the
more ſpedyly paſſe his armye, and artillerie, he prouided
a great number of botes and faſtened them to bothe
the ſhores, and then laide his bridge made of bordes and
called into the Caſtle ſuche Citizens as he ſuſpected, and

                  •
               cauſed them to be ſafely kepte, when Tomombe is vnder

               tode that Selim was makinge redie to paſſe the Nilo
with his armye fearinge the inconſtancie of the people
and ſeing no way howe by flyghte he mought prolonge

the warres, determyned to proue what fortune wolde
doe, once more in battayle, wherfore he thought it good
to aſſayle the bridge,the bridge aſſayled. and to ſe yf that he coulde (ſynding
his enemyes occupied in their paſſage ouer) take them
vnprouided and ſo to onerthrowe them, whervpon he
vſed greats celeritie departing from Segeſta in the laſte
watche of the nighte and rode with foure thouſand Mamalukes,
and foure thouſande Mores and Arrabianes,
and came to the brydge before that the Turckes had vnderſtanding
of his departure, and fynding onely y• ſouldiours
of Aſta paſſed, wt their Captatne Maſtaffa Baſcia
he forth with, charged them with ſuche force, y• the Turckes,
not beinge able to endure their vertue, were diſordred
and began to flee, in ſuche ſorte that Muſtaffa not
beinge able to kepe them in order, they were excedingly
ſpoyled & ſtayne, when Selim vnderſtode of the peryll
that his people were in, he haſted to the brydge in perſon,
and ſent ouer with ſuch ſpede as he coulde, aide frō
               tyme
to tyme vnto them, and in ſhorte ſpace he had put
ouer ſo many that he was Maiſter of bothe endes of the
brydge and when he had aſſured the brydge he went in
perſon with certaine bandes with him thether where y•
Soldane was ſyghting, and ſoddenly charged hym, in
ſorts, that he enforced him to retire, whervpon the Sol
dane beinge oute of hope of the victorie, determyned wt
thoſe fewe that he had lefte, by flyghte to ſeke to ſaue
him ſelfe and when they had rydden thre dayes contynually,
they came to a certaine village called Secuſa, and
Selim determyninge to folowe hym whereſoeuer he
ſhoulde goe,Iudgemēt of Selim. dyd ſend after him Muſtaffa Caterbeio, and
Gazzelle with a great number of lighte horſemen which
when they drewe neare to the place where he was, and
had flayne vpon the waye as they came a great number
of his men, and had gyuen commaundement that al the
men of that countre ſhoulde folowe them whereſoeuer
they went vpon great Penaltie, & alſo appointed great
rewarde to whoſouer ſhoulde delyuer him ether deade,
or liuinge, when the Soldane had loſte the greateſt nū
               ber
of hys men, and fearinge the perſecution of the men
of the countre ſeing none other meane to ſaue him ſelfe

chaunged his garnementes, and departed ſecretly, and
dyd hyde him in a mareſe there by, and couered him ſelfe
wyth reed and ſuche lyke as dyd growe thervpon, but
the countre men beinge very gredie of the rewarde that
was promyſed, went and ſerched al ſecrete places, wher
in he moughte be hidden, whervpon certaine of them
went into the mareſe and ſerched very diligently, and
in the ende foūde him hidden in the water vp to ye throte
and then toke hym, with dyuerſe of his cheife and principall
councellours, & preſentyd him bounde to Muſtaffa
and the reſte of the Captaines, who forthewith ſent him
an towarde Cairo in miſerable ſorte, and preſented him
to Selim, who wolde not ſpeake vnto him but deliuered
him to hys myniſtres and cauſed him to be examined wt
ſondrie tormentes to make hym to confeſſe where the
treaſoure of Campſone the Soldane was, and whē they
had done all that they were able to doe, they coulde not
onely, not cauſe him to manifeſt it, but alſo coulde not
with all their tormentes cauſe him to ſpeake one worde
the conſtancie of his mynde was ſuche,Conſtanci of Tomō
                  beio. the nerte morning
folowinge he cauſed him to be lad openly therowe
the Citie, to the gate called Baſuela and hanged him by
the necke,A lamentable ende of the valiante and noble Tomombeio. & then put a chaine of Iron aboute his necke
and cauſed him continually to hange ouer the gate. The
cauſe whie Selim dyd this cruelly, and ſhamefully put
Tomombeio to deathe, was for that, that after he was
gone into ye Region of Segeſta (acording to the opinion
of dyuerſe) Selim ſendinge hys Oratours to him, to require
him to be content and to giue ouer and to cōmitte
him ſelfe to the faith of Selim, who promiſed him great
place, and dignities, the Mamalukes contrarie to all reaſon,
and order of men, wolde not ſuffer them to comme
in his preſence, but cut them in peces, whē Tomombeio
was dead, he cauſed to put to deathe all the Mamalukes
and ſouldiours that he had in the priſonnes, and lefte
none on lyue ye were able once to holde vp head agaynſt
him, when the inhabitantes of Alexandria vnderſtode
what was done at Cairo, they b

               gan to rebell and made
an vprore, toke their weaponnes and cried the name of
Selim throughe oute the Citie they toke vpon the ſodden

the fortes of the Citie and the Fareglion alſo,Fareglion the chiefe forte in Alexādria. and
toke priſoners all the Mamalukes and officers, that the
Soldane had there, Selim determined to poſſeſſe al ſuch
countres and Regiones, bothe he on this ſide, and beyonde
the ryuer Nilo: as were wonte to obey the Soldanes of
Cairo,Cairo with al the prouinces therevnto belonging poſſeſſed by Selim wherfore he ſent manye of his Captaines wyth
their companies to take poſſeſſyon: who ſyndinge none
that made reſyſtance, cauſed them al to ſwere obedience
and trouthe to Selim, and in ſhorte ſpace broughte all
to his deuotion, moreouer dyuerſe kynges of Affrica
which were confederate alwayes with the Soldanes, &
dyd paie vnto them certaine tribute, when they had vuderſtandinge
of the ſucceſſe of Selim, ſent their ambaſſadours
to renewe the confederacie, in ſuche ſorte that
both on this ſide and beyonde the Nilo, there reſted not
in Egipte one hauen euē to the confines of Iudea, oute
of the obedience of Selim Emperour of Turckie, ſauing
onely the Arrabianes, cheifely thoſe that dwelled in Affrica,
ſuche as from the begynninge had their confines
vpon the ryuer Euphratos (& at this preſent haue them
ſtretched oute to the verye Dceane) & after that hauing
fylled al Affrica and Egipte,Digreſſyō
                with their multitudes, contynually
ererciſed in warres vpon the people that confyned

to vnite them ſelues in campe, & ſoto comme and fyghte
as men of warre in battayle, they haue no certaine dwelling

vpon their waggens in great compaines and numbres
which are their Cities & townes, euery Citie or towne
hathe his propre Captaine appointed vnto hym, they
doe not marrie, or otherwiſe ioigne in fryndſhyppe with
anye other nation, they eſte me them ſelues the moſt noble,
and ancient nation of the worlde, as a people that
neuer was mingled with any other nation but haue continued
their nobility, and antiquitie vncoroupted from
the beginninge of the worlde, they are maruelouſty wiſe
and proue excellent in any kynde of diſcipline or ererciſe
that they take in hande, they vſe towarde ſtraungers y•
comme into their countrey greate courteſie and liberalitie,

and in dede yf they dyd agree amonge them ſelues,
they were able to ſubdue all the countreys aboute them
but maintainig amonge them certaine ancient inimities
lefte vnto them by their predeceſſours they are contynually
accupied with cyuyllwarres and diſſentiones
the onercontynually ſpoylinge the other, but retorninge
nowe to our hiſtorie, when Selim had receaued the obedience
and faythe, of the whole Empire of the Soldane
he ment to ſee Alexandria before that he wolde departe
oute of Egipte, whervpon he embarcked, and ſayled
downe the ryuer, and in fewe dayes arriued at Alexandria,
and when he had ſeen and vewed his Nauie which
was newlye arriued there from Conſtantinople, he appointed
them what to doe, and when he had furniſhed
the Farreglion and the reſte of the fortes, with bands of
hys ſouldiours and monition, he then eſtabliſhed the gouernement
of the Citie, and when he had put to deathe
all the Mamalukes that were there in priſon he retorned
againe to Cairo, and toke oute of it fyue hundred
houſholdes, of the moſt noble and principall of the Citie
with all their children and ſubſtance, and ſent them to
Alexandria to hys Nauie who conueied them with all
their riches and treaſoure to Conſtantinople, he ſent
thyther alſo in dyuerſe paſſagers, hyred ſhyppes, a great
number of the children, and wyues of the Mamalukes
and when he had thus appointed his departure he lefts
in Cairo a great garde of Turckes and appointed Carerbeio
to be his lieutenante in all Egipte, ho, which at the
death of Camſone the Soldane, was gouernour in Aleppo,
this ellection dyd very much diſpleaſe Iunio Baſſa
who ſucceded in y• place of bellagarbei of Gretia, Sinan
Baſſa, who was y• cheife, & in greateſt fauor wt the Emperour
who had promiſed him y• place, he coulde not endure
to ſe Carerbeio a newe man to be preferred before
him, & not being able to diſſēble his wrath, began to gouerue
y• that was cōmitted to his charge ouerthwartli, &
troublonſly,The paie of the ſouldiours

he called to mindother diſpleaſures alſo, & began tohate
hī excedīgli wherof afterward proceded his death as ſhal
be declared hereafter y• ſouldiours wt were leſte at Cairo

required their lorde that they moughte haue their paye
augmented, who cōmaunded Iunſo Baſſa to ſee it done
and to cauſe the treaſorer that he lefte there to doe acording
to his order, when the Emperour was departed frō
Cairo Iunio ſemyd not to remember it, and gaue no order
at all in that behalfe, wherfore it folowed, that whē
Selim was gone from Cairo into Iudea, and that the
paie came, the ſouldiours had not their entertainement
encreaſyd, whervpon they began to Mutyne and rebett
againſt Carerbeio, and he excuſed him ſelfe, and cauſed
them to ſend with all ſpede after the Emperour and to
complaine vnto him or their wronge, they ſounde hym
neare vnto Iberuſalem, declaring howe that at ye tyme
of their paie they receaued nothinge but their ordinarie
and that the Treaſurer declared that he had no commiſſion
to augment their paie, they declared vnto him alſo,
that to lyue there was very chargeable and that their
ordinarie was not able to maintaine them there, whervpon
Selim was excedinglye wrothe for that that hys
order which he lefte, was not put in execution, and adding
to this dyuerſe other complaintes which he had receaued
from Cairo, of the behauiour of Iunio, cheifely
touchinge the families that were ſent to Conſtantinople,
wherupon he cōmaunded him to comme to him, and
as ſone as he came to him he commaunded him forthe wt
to be hanged, and when he had eſtabliſhed the gouernement
of Paleſtina, he wente into Soria, and appointed
Gazzelle to be gouernour of Damaſcs,Note this great voyage, to leade an armye ſo farre by lande. one of the Captaines
of Campſone, he appointed alſo a gouernour to
Aleppo, and to al the reſte of the townes of the prouince
leuinge them all well furniſhed with all kynde of monition,
and men. And determyninge to prouide for the defence
of Soria againſt y• Sophie, he lefte Muſtaffa Baſria
in Cilicia, at the fote of the Mounte Tauro with
xl. M. horſemen, and when he had this done he determyned
to goe home into Gretia, and coaſted all alonge the
ſea ſyde of the leſſer Aſia and ſo paſſed into Bithinia to
the Citie of Burſia, and from thence paſſed on to ye Golfe
and fyndinge his Nauie redie there he embarcked hys
ſouldiours of Europe and then ſayled on to Conſtantinople,

and when he was there arriued he ſent his people
to garniſon, and conſumed al that winter in viſiting
the townes of Gretia, and late in Caſtoria, a long tyme
and toke great pleaſure in chaſinge, when the ſpaynge
of the yere came, he went from thence into Remania, &
gaue order to make redie his Naute, and cauſed them to
take oute of the Arſenale, all his Galleys, fuſtes, and
Palandres, willinge them to be broughte into Propontide,
and in ſhorte ſpace he had betwene Gallipolli, and
Conſtantinople, vpon the ſea, moe then two hundred
Galleys beſyde his other ſhyppes with all their tacle, &
furniture, and hauinge alredie ſent to the foreſte manye
carpentres, he cauſed to cut a great quantitie of tymber
which cauſed manie men to thīke y• he made this prouiſion
to emploie it vpon the Iſle of Rhodes, notwithſtanding
that then, and afterwarde, there were diuerſe that
thoughte it not made for Rhodes, but to be emploied againſt
Italie, and in the ende when euery thinge was redie
he commaūded them to roe downe to the mouthe of
the ſtraite and there to ryde, and euery man thought y•
within fewe dayes they ſhoulde haue ben paied, & commaunded
to ſet ſayle and to doe ſomme great enterpriſe
vpon the ſodden: which fewe vnderſtode, after this their
came commaundement ſoddenly, that forthewith they
ſhoulde diſcharge and vnrigge the Nauie, and licenſe y•
maryners to goe home to their dwellinge places, after
this the cauſe of this greate preparation, and the ſoodden
diſoluinge therof, coulde neuer be vnderſtande, yet
ſomme men thinke that a ſycknes that then was cōme
vpon Selim was the cauſe therof. When he had vnrigged
his Nauie, he departed from thence to Andrinople,
and ſeminge to take ſome pleaſure in the chaſe, he laie
in litle villages aboute it and conſumed the reſte of the
ſommer there, with y• Automne alſo, and the winter folowinge
after this, there appeared in the raines of hys
backe, an incancred appoſtume, which dyd ſo eate hys
fleſhe ye a man moughte haue put into the ſore his whole
hande and they dyd cut awaye y• fleſhe rounde aboute it
which was ſo deade that he felte it not. And I wyll not
here omitte a notable matter, which was declared vnto

me in Florence of him (by a Perſian of ye Mahometane
religiō) hauing for my turciman a citizen of ours named
Iohu Cerini, & it is this, that on a tyme as his diſeaſe
dyd growe and encreaſe vpon him, reſtinge his head vpon
the thinge of Perino one of his Baſcias, he ſayd vnto
him Perino I doe conſume, & muſte dye within ſhorte
ſpace withoute all remedie, vpon the which wordes the
Baſcia toke occaſion to talke furder wt him, & ſayd vnto
him my lorde, yf thou knoweſt y• thou muſt dye, whye
doeſte not thou gyue order for the diſpoſinge of thoſe
goodes which at thy commaundement were arreſted &
taken from the marchants called Aggiammi in Burſia

            A COMMENTARIE
OF THE WARRES OF THE TVRCKES MADE
againſt George Scanderbeg prince of Epirro and of the victories
obtained by the ſayde George, as well againſt the Emperoures
of Turchie, as other princes, and of his rare force and
vertue worthy of memorie.
            
               SCanderbeg prince of Epirto was ſonne to the lord
Iohn Caſtrioth, ye which poſſeſſid y• part
of Albania, that was called Emathia, and
Tumeneſtia: and the mother of Scander
beg was named Volſaua, ſhe was daughter
to the prince of Pollogo, whiche is
a part of Macedonia, and alſo of Burgaria, this Iohn
was a worthy man, and of great Iugement & experience
in the warres, and hauinge warres with Amorathe
Ottomanno prince of the Turckes, and ſeing him to be
wexed very ſtonge in Gretia, and Albania, in ſuch ſorte
as in the ende he was not able to encountre him, wherfore
he made peace with him, and for hoſtages deliuered
him his ſonnes, which were Repoſſio, Staniſſa, Conſtantino
and this Scanderbeg whiche was then named
George, but when this tiran Amorathe cauſed him in
his chyldhod to be circumciſed, he gaue him the name of
Scanderbeg, which in our ſpeche is, lord Alerandre, and
after that, the Turcke cauſed him to be inſtructed acording
to the rite and cuſtume of the Mahometane ſecte
Amorathe truely ſemed to be exceding glad when Scanderbeg
(being a childe but of eyghte yeres of age) was
broughte to his preſence, and ſeinge him beautifull and
to haue a maieſtie in his countenance, he iugged in hym
ſelfe that yf he ſhoulde lyue longe, he wolde proue a worthye
man, wherfore he determyned neuer to ſuffer him
to retorne home againe, but to kepe him in his courte,
to the ende that when he was comme to y• ſtate of a mā
he ſhoulde ſerue him, and therfore appointed him worthy
maſters to inſtructe him, and to be carefull for him
and to ſe him broughte vp in lerning, and ciuilitie he alowed
bothe for his table and apparell euen as yf he had
ben his owne ſonne. After this when Scanderbeg was
ſomethinge growen he delighted to ryde, and to ronne,

and alſo with his cōmpaniones to vſe the launce, and y•
rabattued ſworde, and he dyd excede them all bothe on
horſebacke, and on forte, and chiefely yf it were in y• preſence
of Amorathe, who had greate felicitie of ſe litle
boyes in ſuche exerciſes, and dyd maruelouſly reioyſe to
ſe ſuche force & towardnes in Scanderbeg who alwaies
remayned victoriouſe. After this whē the Turcke made
warres againſt anye prince, he commaunded to bringe
Scanderbeg alwaies with him whytherſoeuer he went
and when ſo euer he ſoughte with his enemys Scander
beg behaued him ſelfe ſo well that all the Turckes maruellyd
at his doinges and wolde ſaye amonge them ſelues,
that yf he mought lyue tyll he came to perfecte age
no man ſhoulde be able to continue againſt hem. When
Scanderbeg was come to y• age of .xix. yeres. y• Turcke
made him a Sangiacco, which is as muche to ſaye as a
conductour of ſondrie, bandes, and gaue him ye leadinge
of fyue thouſand horſes, and ſome tyme the title of geuerall
of an armye which in the Turckiſhe ſpeche is called
Baſſa, ſending him againſt his enemyes, accompanied
with mani other Sangiachi which were appointed to be
directed by him, and to be at his commaundement, and
beinge in that parte of the leſſer Aſia that is called Natolia,
and hauing many rencountres with his enemyes
he alwayes made great ſlaughter of them and departed
from them with the victorie, by meanes wherof? he toke
manye townes and Cities of that countre and brought
them vnder the obedience of the Turcks, who from that
tyme forth, wolde alwayes ſaye that Scanderbeg was
his righte arme, his harte, and his eye, and his moſte
aſſured defendour, and augmentour of his dominions,
whervpon all the reſte of the Turckes dyd marueloſlye
loue him, and had him in great eſtimation. After this
Scanderbeg beinge of the age of .xxv. yeres and attending
vpon his lorde in Andrinople, beinge in the companie
of many noble men,A Tartare chalengethe. there came thither a Tartare
of a great ſtature, and an exceding force, and chalenged
to fyghte with anye man in all the Turckes courte to ye
vtterance and there was no man that durſte to aunſwer
his chaleng, for that the brute was that he neuer

foughte with anye but that he ouercame him, and had
ſtaine manye men in the lyke combattes when Scander
beg ſawe this, he went to the prince and declared vnto
him and to all the noble men there, that he wolde encoū
               tre
him, and fyghte with him to the death, but his lord
with all the reſte of the noble men, wolde in no wyſe agree
vnto it, but were all very ſorye to ſee him ſo diſpoſed,
yet for all that, he made ſo erneſt requeſte and contynued
it with ſuche Inſtancie, that in the end with great
difficultie he obtained his requeſte, and then made him
redie and went in the preſence of them all with great as
to encountre this Tartarre, who diſdained him
euen as Goliathe dyd Dauid, and ſayd that it greued
him much to fyght with ſo yonge a man, wherfore Scanderbeg
was excedingely wrothe with him, and ſtrake at
him and ſo behaued him ſelfe in the combatte that in the
ende he obtained y• victorie & ſlewe the Tartarre. Shortly
after Amorathe went to Burſia: a Citie of Bithinia
where two ſouldiours of Perſia one named Iaia and y•
other Zāpſa which made a like chalenge to that that y•
Tartarre made ſauinge that they wolde fyghte on horſbackes
with launce, ſworde, and Targe, whervpon as
ſone as the chalenge was made, Scanderbeg made redie
and encoūtred with Iaia and as they were erneſtly fightinge,
this cruell Zampſa aſſayled him in treaſon, but
Scanderbeg diſcoraged not at all for that but aſſured
him ſelfe in god, and put on a noble mynde and within
ſhorte tyme he ſlewe them bothe, for the which notable
acto he was muche prayſed of all thoſe that were there
preſent, after this y• Hungarians came to make warres
vpon the Turckes and to enuade their countrey wherfore
Scāderbeg was ſent Captaine generall, with a greate
armye againſt them, & in that enterpriſe he behaued
him ſelfe ſo diſcretely and circumſpectly that the Hungarians
retorned againe withoute battaile. He alwaies
had that attended vpon him Chriſtianes of his fathers
ſubiectes, who alwayes in ſtructed him in the Chriſtian
faythe which he had receaued at his Bapteſme, wherfore
he founde the meanes that the Hungarianes retorned
withoute battayle and be alſo retorned with his armie

ſafe to Andrinople, where he was excedingly embraced
of the Turcke and honored with great preſentes, &
he ſayd to his moſt famylier fryndes, that the Hungarianes
feared the vertue and worthynes of Scanderbeg
and therfore retorned and wolde not gyue battayle, he
deſyred Scanderbeg to require ſome great gyfte of him
but Scanderbeg aunſweringe very modeſtly ſayd that
he required nothinge but to dwell in his good grace, and
fauour, wherwith he ſhoulde holde him very well ſatiſfyed,
whē they had ended theſe diſcourſes,The father of Scanderbeg deceaſſed. newes came
that the lord Iohn father to Scanderbeg was deceaſſyd
whervpon Amorathe in all haſte diſpatched a Captaine
of his named Sehalia `with an armie into Albania who
as ſone as he came thyther toke y• Citie of Croia with
the whole ſtate of the lorde Iohn, to the behofe and vſe,
of the hoſtages, gyuing the people to vnderſtande, that
the greate Turcke wolde immediatly delyuer it to one
of the ſōnes of the prince Iohn deceaſed, but after that,
the Turcke performed noe one thinge y• the Baſſa had
promiſed in his name to the people,Thre of the bretheren of Scā
                  derbeg poyſoned. but kepte all y• contre
to his owne vſe, and cauſed three of the bretheren of
Scanderbeg ſecretly to be poyſoned, and fedde him with
goodly wordes, keping him alwayes in good hope deſyring
him to haue pacience for a litle tyme and that as
ſone as he had diſpatched certaine affares, he wolde reſtore
him to all that which was his righte to haue, and
he ſhoulde be alwaies aſſured of his good wyl and frynd
ſhyppe, but Scanderbeg lyke a wyſe man, and one that
well knewe his determynation to be full of crueltie and
wickednes, declared him ſelfe to be w
                  •
               ll contented with
whatſoeuer ſhoulde be his good wyll and pleaſure, notwithſtanding,
in wardly he was full of ſorowe and heuynes,
and he thoughte on nothinge daye nor nighte, but
howe to fynde ſome meanes, by the which he moughte
bring to paſſe to enioye that patrimonie which was his
fathers, and to lyue in libertie of conſciens as a Chriſtian
oughte to doe, and the rather for that he was oute
of hope to be delyuered by the Turcke, and to be reſtored
to his righte. After theſe thinges, when the yere was ended,
the Hungarianes at the requeſte of the pope Eugenio,

aſſembled a mightye armye and went againſt the
Turcke in the behalfe of the diſpotto of of Seruia, which
when the Turcke vnderſtode, he gathered togyther his
armye, and ſent the Baſſa of Romania Captaine generall
of the ſame, beinge acompanied with Scanderbeg,
to the ende that by his helpe, he moughte the more aſſuredly
obtane victorie, & contrarily, Scanderbeg praied
to god that it wolde pleaſe him to gyue y• Hungarianes
the victorie. And in the ende the two armyes metinge
neare the Ryuer called Moraua, ioyned in battayle. And
the diſcipline & vertue of Iohn Hūniade, Captaine generall
of the Hungarianes was ſuche, by the helpe of god
that the Turckes after a longe fyghte were diſordered,
and put to flyghte, with excedinge great flaughter and
ſpoyle of them, Scanderbeg dyd maruelouſly reioyſe for
this victorie, and yet he fled amonge the Turckes, tyll
he came to a ſecrete place, where he was ſafe frō peryll,
and afterwarde when it was nighte, the Turckes chiefe
ſecretarie came vnto him and ſaid. O Scanderbeg what
doeſte thou here, thou whiche neuer was ſeen to flee or
this tyme? Scanderbeg deſcretly aunſwering ſayd, that
the power of man, moughte not reſyſte the wyll of god,
wherfore there was no remedie but patience, and when
he had thus ſayd, he commaunded to laye handes on the
Secretarie, and to ſet yronnes vpon his legges, where
with be beinge excedingely amaſed ſayd, that it ſemyd
ſtraunge vnto him, conſydering his faithfull ſeruice alwaies,
and that he had neuer offendyd his lord y• Turcke
ne yet Scanderbeg, then Scanderbeg ſmyling aūſwered
that he helde him ſo for no cauſe, but onely for that he
ſhoulde not ſtele awaye,A policie of Scā. and for that he ſhoulde make
him a letter, in y• name of the Turcke to the gouernour
of Croia, that forthwith vpon ſyghte therof: he ſhoulde
delyuer the Citie to Scanderbeg, as gouernour in the
name of the Turcke, and he wolde alſo that the Secretarie
ſhoulde goe with him, and he wolde gyue him greater
place then that which he had with the Turcke, and
wolde euer eſteme him for his deare frynd, and brother.
            The Secretarie aunſwered with a troubled countenance,
that he wolde not make ſuche a letter for anye

thinge in the worlde, whervpon Scanderbeg drewe his
ſworde and threatned to kyll hym yf that forthe with he
made not the letter, whervpon he beinge excedingly affraied
toke pen, yncke, and paper, and wrote the letter
accordingly as Scanderbeg gaue him inſtruction in the
Turckiſhe language, he coulde not deceaue him therin
for Scanderbeg vnderſtode well the Turckiſhe tonge,
the Arabian, the Greeke, and the Schiauon, when this
was done,The ſecretarie of the turcke ſlayne. Scanderbeg wylled the Secretarie to goe wt 
him, but he refuſed vtterly ſo to doe whervpon he cauſed
him ſoddenly to be ſlayne to that ende, that he ſhoulde
not goe and declare the matter to the great Turcke, and
in this ſorte he was preuented.
            Then Scanderbeg with three hundred Albaneſes, valiante
and faithefull men, who had alwaies ſerued him
and were well trayned and experimented in the warres
toke his waye, and rode very ſecretly, and ſpedyly, and
in ſhorte tyme aryued in Albania, where he founde certaine
of the Turckes ſouldiours, whom he cauſed very
corteſly to ſouppe with him, and after ſondrie pleaſante
diſcourſes, aſked them if that they had herde any thinge
of the cauſe of his comming thyther, who aunſwered
him no, then he declared vnto them that for ſondrie reſpectes,
the Turcke had ſent him to chaunge the gouernour
of Croia & to ſupplie that place for a ſeaſon, whervpon
they aūſwered al at once franckly, that they were
aſſured that he was ſent for ſome greatter purpoſe then
that, conſydering, that they were well aſſured that the
Turcke loued him as his brother, and one of them, offered
to goe before wt the meſſager that he ſent, to certyfye
the gouernour of Croia hereof, wherewith Scanderbeg
was well contentyd, and ſent them before to Croia
with ſpede. As ſone as the gouernour vnderſtode the
Tenour of the letter, he made redie to doe, all that was
commaunded him in that letter. Afterward when Scanderbeg
came into Croia, becauſed to take downe the
Turckes enſeigne and to ſet vp his wt the ſplayed Egle
of ſable in a feelde of gules,The entre of Scanderbeg into Croia. and they cried in euery place
longe maye Scanderbeg lyue, and then he cauſed to ſley
all the Turckes that wolde not be baptiſed, & in foure

dayes he recouered all his fathers countre, and by that
twenty daies were ended, he had poſſeſſyd al that which
the Turcke had woonne in Albania, and cut in peces as
as many Turckes as he found there, in ſorte, y• in an in
ſtāte he became prince of Albania, where he had of yerly
rent two hundred thouſande ducates, accomptinge hys
ſalte pittes which he hade neare to Saincte Nicolo dela
Pietra, where Ceſare the Dictator, foughte that terrible
battayle wt Pompeio, his father in lawe, Captaine
generall of the Romane armye.
            When the Albaneſes were thus delyuered from the
Tiran, and from his wicked and cruell gouernement, &
from the intollerable yoke of the infydelles, they thancked
god in euery place, & they cried thorowe oute, longe
maye oure prince Scanderbeg lyue, and in fewe dayes
Scanderbeg had an armye of .xv. M. Albaneſes wel trained
in the warres, ſome on horſebacke, and ſome on fote
then ho apointed officers of ſe Iuſtice duely executed,Note his age. &
apointed Captaines to his townes and fortes in y• yere
of oure lorde. M.CCCC.xliii. and in the yere from his
byrthe xxxiii.
            When the Turcke dyd vnderſtande this fynoſſe of
Scanderbeg, and the victorie of the Hungarianes, he had
ſo greate ſorowe, as in all his lyfe he had not had y• lyke
wherfore he determyned to be reuenged and to employe
all his force againſt Scanderbeg, but Scanderbeg being
very wiſe and one that knowe what he had to doe, being
aduertized of the Turckes determination and purpoſe,
went to Aleſſio, a Citie in Albania, then vnder the gouernement
of the Venetianes, where at his requeſte all
the princes helde a councell, with the reſte of the nobilitie
of Albania: of whom theſe that folowe were y• chiefe
Aramthe Conino which was afterwarde father in lawe
to Scanderbeg, Andrea Thopia, Paulo Ducagino, Nicolo,
Pietro, Spano, Lech Duſmano Leche Zacharia, &
the honorable lieutenantes of the Senate of Veniſe, to
whom Scanderbeg ſpake in this forme.The oration of Scan.
            
            Very honorable fathers and magnificent princes. I
doubte not, but that it is well knowen to vs with howe
great inimitie, and diſpite, the Turckes doe perſecuteour

moſte Chriſtian faithe, and howe greatly they are
enemyes to all vertue, and eſpecially: they neuer kepe
anye promeſe that they make, and yf their powre were
agreable to there wyll, they wolde make all Chriſtian
princes to paſſe by the edge of the ſworde, as by experience
it hathe ben ſeen here to fore, when god for our offences
hathe permitted it, yet I by the mightye arme of
god haue chaſed the vſurpers of my fathers ſtate, oute
of it, and haue cut all the Turckes in peces that made
anye reſyſtance againſt me, and beſydes that, I haue
wonne all that which ye Turcke dyd poſſeſſe in Albania
as it is manifeſte to all men, wherfore your excellenties
maye be well aſſured, that that cruell dogge, wyll employe
all his force poſſyble againſt me, and that wt ſpede
and yf that by chaunce (which god forbydde) he ſhoulde
ouercomme me, he wolde immediatly make warres vpon
you, wherfore I doe erhorte, and erneſlly deſyre your
highneſſes, that for the loue you heare towarde god &
our moſte holly faythe, and alſo for charitie, that it will
pleaſe you to voucheſafe to vnite your forces wt myne,
and yf it ſeme not good vnto you ſo to doe, for ſo muche
as you are at peace with the Turcke, yet I ſhall erneſtly
deſyre you, to ſtande by, and nether to ayde the Turcke
nor trouble me, and hereof I do attende your gentle aū
               ſwere,
for that that I hope with the mightie right hand
of god, to defend my ſelfe againſt y• great Tyran. Then
all the princes and noble men of Albania, withdrewe
them ſelues with the lieutenantes of the Senate of Veniſe,
and went to talke in ſecrete, and when they had
conſydered, and debatted the importancie of the matter,
they made aunſwere to Scanderbeg in this ſorte, moſte
excellent prince George, oure deare ſonne and brother,
as touchinge your age, but in reſpecte of your vertue &
worthyneſſe, oure honorable father, we haue very well
conſydered, and weyed thy iuſte, and moſte neceſſarie

neceſſarie, and commaunde, for you ſhall not wante, and
alſo we wyll alowe you a yerely ſtypende towarde your
owne maintenance, and you ſhal not lacke that that we
ſhalbe able to doe in any reſpecte, when this moſte holly
league was concluded, the aforeſayde princes of Albania
went and dyned with Scanderbeg their newe
lord, and thancked god of this concord, and
then ſome of them toke leaue and retorned
to their prouinces, and others accompained
Scanderbeg to the citie
of Croia.
            
               A briefe declaration of the chiefe princes of Albania included
in the aforeſayde league
               GEorge Caſtrioth, els named Scāderbeg, appointed
Captaine generall by their common conſent, deſernethe
to be fyrſt named, after him his father in lawe
Aranith Conino, then the ſonnes of Muſachio Thopia,
called of many Carlnich which in the Schianuon tonge
betokennethe gloriouſe, and they are called the ſonnes
of Charles, for ſo muche as they are diſcended from the
houſe of Fraunce, then were the lordes of the houſe of
Ducagini, and the noble men of the houſ of Spain, the
lordes Cernouichi, and Duſmani, but the Venetianes
wolde not enter into this league for the good wyll they
bare to the houſe of Angelo, whiche is diſcended from
the Imperiall houſe of Conſtantinople on the one ſyde
and on the other: from that of the diſpotto of Scruia, &
of y• noble princeſſe Margaerite of Monferato, ducheſſe
of Mantoa, who beſyde her other patrimonie, had dyuerſe
parcells in Albania, & chiefely Driuaſto, Antiuari
and Croia: and poſſeſſethe at thys preſent Antiuari
and Dolcigno, with other places that haue not howed

the knee before the Idol Baale, which is Mahomethe,
and it maye pleaſe god to gyue them the grace to conuerte
the Turckes and other infidelles to oure moſt holly
faithe, or els to ouerthro we their greate powers as
dyuerſe tymes Scanderbeg hath done.
               Somme man mought aſke me here, from whence Albania
had his name? Whefore you ſhall vnderſtande
that Plinio in his Booke intitled de Hominibus Illuſiris
in the thyrde Chapiter,The originall of the Albaneſes. dothe declare, howe y• Tullio
hoſtilio the thyrde kynge of the Romanes, when he had
deſtroied the Citie of Alba, which was not farre diſtante
from Rome, and had ben often tymes enemye vnto it,
commaūded that the Albaneſes ſhoulde come and dwell
at Rome, but a great number of them (acordinge to the
opinion of dyuerſe writers) went into Aſia and dwelled
amonge the people therof which poſſeſſed the countre y•
lieth betwene the mountaines called hiberi and Caucaſt
y• Albaneſes increaſed, & multiplied from tyme to tyme
ſo that at the laſte, their countre was called Albania
Iberia, which this ſame Plinio deſcribeth in y• vi booke
of his naturall hiſtorie, and in the thyrde chapiter, from
whence one parte of the Albaneſes departed, and came
downe into Europe, of whom the one parte dwelled in
Epirro, others in Macedonia, ſomme, in one parte of Liburnia
which at this preſent is called Eſemptia ye loer
neare vnto Macedonia and Epirro, ſome dwelled in a
certaine parte of Dalmatia: and Illiria which is called
ye hie Eſemptia neare vnto that parte of Liburnia wher
of we ſpake before, when the Albaneſes had longe contynued
in the aforeſayde countres, they were ſo encreaſed
and multiplied that of all thoſe prouinces was made
one Region and gouernement, and was called Albania
for that it was inhabited by y• Albaneſes who ſo named
it, other ſome ſaye that the Albaneſes are deſcended frō
Fraunce, peraduenture for that they ſee a natural frindſhippe
betwene the noble men of both the coūtres, which
thinge is perfectly knowen by certaine of their princes
as by the lordes of Durazzo, ſurnamed Thopia whiche
are diſcended from Charles the greate, ſome other frō
Meſchino, and ſomme from others, and for a token of

good wyll, Charles is made in the Citie of Croia of an
excellent ſtone, engrauen with great ſkyll and, arte and
ſet in the chiefe place of the Citie, others ſaye they are
diſcended frō Griffon de Altafoglia as the houſe of Ducagine
and the houſe of Spagni as ye noble men of both
houſes them ſelues ſaye.
               Let all men knowe that this newe Albania which is
this diſcribed, liethe in Europa, it is very fertile & plentyfull
of al thinges nedfull to y• maintenance of mānes
lyfe as is poſſyble, it bringeth forthe men naturally ſo
ſtronge, valiaunte, of noble myndes, and apte to anye
thinge that they take in hande, chiefely, for the warres
as is poſſyble, they are conſtant and faythfull to their naturall
lordes, and wyll rather committe them ſelues, to
all kynde of daunger and peryll, then to haue their diſpleaſure,
the fardeſt part of this Albania is neare to the
ſeas Adriatico, and Ienio, and liethe ouer againſt Puglia,
froō Durazzo to Brindizio, is an hundred myles and
from Valoua ouer to Ottranto thre ſcore myles by ſea.
Nowe to oure purpoſe.
               After all theſe thinges there came aſpiall from Andrinople
to Scanderbeg, & declared vnto him y• Alibege, one
of the Turckes Baſſas came againſt him with .xl. M horſemen,
then Scanderbeg withoute delaye rode to his
confynes with .xv. M. Albaneſes, and when y• Turckes
were comme within two myles of him,A perfecte Captaine muſt be able wel to ſpeake his mynde. he made an oration
to his armie wherby he dyd ſo encorage his ſouldiours,
that they deſyred nothinge ſo muche as to encoū
                  tre
with the enemye, in this meane tyme the Turckes
came on with ſuche a noiſe, that it ſemed that the heauens
ſhoulde fal, but Scanderbeg with his worthy ſouldiours
refuſed not to encountre them, but made ye ſigne
of the croſſe vpon hym, and then he cried folowe me, &
thruſte towarde them and was the fyrſte that ſtrake, &
charged them with ſucke force and vertue, that in ſhorte
tyme he diſordered them, and when the battayle was ended,
there were founde deade on the place .xxii.22. thouſād Turckes ſlayne. M. Turckes,
and there were taken a thouſand, of the Chriſtians
manye were hurte and one hundred ſtayne vpon ye place
all the ſpoyle of the Turckes as money, Iuelles, horſes

and ſuche lyke, was preſented to Scanderbeg, who canſed
it wholly to be diſſtributed to his ſouldiours, whiche
were all very ioyfull. The nexte daye Scanderbeg commaunded
to ſounde to horſe and rode into the Turckes
countre a great dayes iorney, and cut in peces as many
Turckes as he mette or coulde fynde, and rayſed fire in
all places where he wente. In this meane while Alibeg
Baſſa retorned to Andrinople, and was greatly blamed
by the Turcke for his euell gouernement.
               Laodiſlao king of Hungarie, who then made preparatiō
to goe againſt Amorathe wt an armie, ſent to Scanderbeg
(vnderſtādīg of y• great victorie y• he had obtained
againſt him) to deſyre him that he wolde goe in his companie,
wt ſuch bandes of ſouldiours as he ſhould thincke
good, wherfore when Scanderbeg had redde his letter,
he called vnto him his Captaines ſhowing them the letter
and aſking their aduiſe in y• behalfe, who aunſwered
by one conſent that he mought in no wyſe refuſe ye king
in ſo reaſonable a demaunde, for y• it was for the diſtruction
of the common enemye of our faithe, then Scanderbeg
wrote vnto the kinge Laodiſlao that he moughte aſſure
him of all the ayde that he ſhoulde be able to gyue
him, and then Scanderbeg by ye helpe of Paulo Ducagino
and other princes of his nation had leuied other xv. M
men, beſides thoſe that he had alredie vnder his conducte
with whom he defeicted the aforeſayde Alibeg, which amounted
in the whole to the number of xxx. M. and then
he began to marche, but George Vucouich diſpotto of
Seruia a man valiante ynoughe, but of a traitorouſe
mynde, and regarded not anye religion, neither Chriſtian
nor Mahometane, for that he had gyuen Amorathe to
wife, his daughter named Hierenia, and of ſome Cataguſina,
which was ſyſter to the wyfe of Aleſſio Spano called
Iſabetta, and of ſome others Milizza, which was ſiſter
to Lazaro, Stephane, and Georgio, Nephewes to
Andrea Augelo by there mother ſide, for certaine hatred
that the Diſpotto bare to the Hungarianes, and chiefely
to Iohn of Tranſyluania, who had ben the cauſe that
certaine caſtles and townes of his were holden frō him
whervpon the Diſpotto fortyfied all the paſſages of his

countre, wherby he troubled Scanderbeg in ſuche ſorte
that he coulde not paſſe withoute great loſſe of his people
into Hungarie.
               In this meane tyme Iohn with the Hungarians, and
Polonianes, beinge ayded alſo by Iuliano Ceſarino
Cardinall S. Angelo, made redie his armie to marche
towarde Varna, where they muſte nedes fyghte: and
Amorathe loked for ayde oute of Aſia to comme to hym
and therfore auoyded by al meanes poſſyble the battaile
and prolonged the warres as much in him was,Science of Iohn Vaiuoda of Tranſyluania. & wolde
not comme to the battayle, whiche when the worthye
Vayuoda vnderſtode, he procured him to the ſcaramoche
in ſo ſkylfull ſorte, that in the ende he enforced hym to
come to the battayle, and in the ende after longe fyghte
the vertue of the Hungarianes was ſuche, that ye Turckes
were diſordered and put to flyghte,The battayle betwene Laodiſlao and Amorathe when Laodiſlao
vnderſtode this, he became excedingly wrothe, by meanes
of the talke of certaine folyſhe and ambitious yong
                     •
                  
men, who ſayde, that Iohn Vaiuoda ſoughte to haue al
the glorie of the victorie to him ſelfe, which was y• cauſe
that he appointed the kinge, alwaye to tarie within his
ſquadrone,Ambition of rayſhe yonge mē diſtroiethe all. the kinge beinge moued with theſe wordes
marched forwarde with his troupe of ten thouſand Hungarianes,
which was very ſtronge, and fronted y• Turckes
great ſquadrone, where after longe and cruel fighte
Laodiſlao, was ſtayne, by meanes wherof, the Hungarianes
which were euen redie to folowe the victorie, were
conſtrained to torue backe againe and to looſe al-in ſuch
ſorte that Iohn Vaiuoda their Captaine generall was
enforced to flee to the houſe of the aforeſayde Diſpotto
of Seruia as to a place of ſecuritie, but he being the onely
cauſe of thys ouerthrowe (for ſo muche as he ſuffred
not Scanderbeg to paſſe thorowe his countre) cauſed
Vaiuoda to be kepte vnder good garde forthe with, vntyll
ſuche tyme as he reſtored him to al his townes, Scā
                  derbeg
ſoughte contynually to paſſe throughe the countre
of the Diſpotto, and hearing of this miſeral le chaūſe
was in ſuch a rage that he brunte and ſacaged all y• countre
of the Diſpotto, and retorned into his owne countre
and as he went homewarde he met with dyuerſe Hungarianes

that were at the battaile of Varna he declared
that he was erceding ſory for it and howe he was comming
to ayde them, and gaue money to euery of them to
helpe them with.
               After all theſe thinges Amorathe the greate Turcke
ſent an ambaſſadour to Scāderbeg with a letter of this
tenour,Amorathe writethe to Scan. Scanderbeg by this my letter.
               I Amorathe Emperour of all the eaſte part of ye worlde
maye not ſalute the more nor leſſe for that thou arte become
my greateſt enemye, and haſte vſed me with ſuche
ingratitude conſidering that I brought the vp and norriſhed
the euen as thou haddeſt ben my naturall ſonne,
and alway ſought to doe the honor and thou haſt nowe
rebelled againſt me, and haſt done me great diſpleaſures
as thou righte well knoweſt, and all men maie witneſſe
therof, and I knowe not from whence it dothe procede,
onleſſe thou waſte angrie with me bycauſe I dyd not ſo
ſone reſtore the to the dominions of thy father or els for
that thou haſt alwayes ben mynded to refuſe the faithe
of the perfete Mahomethe and to retorne, as thou haſte
nowe done, to the Chriſtian faythe to the loſſe of thyne
owne ſoule, truelye yf I had vnderſtode this deſyre of
thyne I wolde haue done, what thou woldeſte haue required
me, & that thou knoweſt well (as I haue alwaies
declared vnto the) that I wolde pleaſure the in anye requeſt
that thou woldeſt make to me, for I was ſo boūde
(conſydering they rare vertues) to fauour the aboue all
others, and thou knoweſt that I promyſed the within
ſhorte ſpace to reſtore the to all thy fathers dominion,
and for that thou haſt done contrarie to thy duetie, thou
arte certaynely worthye of greate blame and of my diſpleaſure,
yet not withſtandinge when I doe conſyder the
vertuouſe actes which in tyme paſſed thou haſte done in
my ſeruice and conſeruation of my ſtate, I am enforced
to qualifye myne ire towardes the: and am contented y•
thou poſſeſſe the inheritance of thy father, vpon condition,
that thou reſtore vnto me y• parte of Albania, which
I haue goten from others and not frō thy father, which
thou againſt all righte haſt ſpoyled me of, and holdeſte it
withoute my good wyll, wherfore ſe that thou doe reſtore

it vnto me, orels I ſwere vnto the by god, and by
his prophete Mahomethe, by the ſoule of my father, and
by my ſworde, that I wyll employe all my force againſt
the, and wyll chaſe the oute of that countre in diſpite
of the, and yf that peraduenture thou eſcape with lyfe, yu
ſhal be enforced to begge thy breade. Thou knoweſt wel
that beſyde all myne other forces. I can put to the feelde
moe then a hundred and fyfty thouſand fightinge men,
and thou hauinge but a handful of ſouldiours arte not
able to reſyfte me. I ſaie theſe thinges vnto the, bycauſe
I wold not hurte thee, I haue ſet before thee, the good, &

Iune. 1444.
               When Scanderbeg had redde the letter, and hearde
the ambaſſadour, he made him to be entertayned very honorably,
and after fyue dayes he diſpatched the ambaſſadour,
and delyuered him a letter of aunſwere, of thys
tenour folowinge.
               George Caſtrioth ſome tyme named Scanderbeg,An aunſwere to the turcks letter.
prince of the Albaneſes, ſendethe ſalutaciones infinite
to the lorde Amorathe prince of the Turckes, by Airadin
thy ſeruante and ambaſſadour, I haue receaued a letter,
in the which for good begynning thou ſayeſt yu canſt
not ſalute me more nor leſſe, wherevnto I aunſwere, y•
yf it ſeme to the by that which I haue alredye done, that
I am becomme thyne enemye: yet yf all thinges be indifferenly
weied it ſhalbe rather iudged that I am thy frind
and for a profe therof I ſaye that their is nothinge in y•
worlde to be done to doe the pleaſure: that I wolde not
for thy ſake doe, ſo that it be not, againſt the wyl of god,
and of this thou maieſt aſſure thy ſelfe, for I determine
to be thy frynde, but yf I haue recouered my libertie, wt 
my fathers countrey, I thincke not therein to haue done
the any wronge, for that it apertayned to me, and not
to the beſyde that, yf the Turckes thy ſouldiours which
laie in thoſe partes of Albania that thou poſſeſſedſt, confyninge
with my countre came againſt me with armed

bandes to aſſayle me, and yf that I, acordinge to their
deſertes haue ouercomme them and chaſtized them, recoueringe
alſo that countre, y• defaute is not myne, but
thers, or his who ſent them againſt me, moreouer yf I
haue defeicted thyne armye which thou dydſte ſende wt 
thy Baſſa Alibeg againſt me. I thincke I haue done but
as I oughte to doe, to defende me and myne, againſt ſuch
as wolde offende me, and to conclude, yf I haue refuſed
the moſt damnable and deteſtable ſecte of Mahomethe, &
am retorned to that moſte true and lyuely faythe of Ieſus
Chriſt, I am well aſſured that I haue choſen the better
part, for in keping his moſt holly commaundements
I am ſuer that my ſoule ſhalbe ſaued and not (as thou
ſayeſt) damned, wherfore I beſeche the, that for y• helthe
of thy ſoule thou wylte receaue one good councell at my
hand, whiche is, that thou wylte voucheſafe to rede the
Alchorane, which is a briefe collection of the commaūdementes
of god, and there thou mayeſte eaſyly conſyder
which of vs is in the wronge, and my hope is, that yf y•
wylte indifferently conſyder, beinge vanquiſhed by the
trouthe, thou wylte receaue and embrace the Chriſtian
faythe, by y• which oneli, all men y• ſeke to be ſaued ar ſaued
& withoute it all men are damned, God graunte, y•
thou mayeſt ſuffer thy ſelfe to be Illumined wt his holly.
Spirite, and to receaue his moſt holly Bapteſme, &
to begyn to leade a Chriſtian lyfe, and then I wolde deſyre
to ſee y• the greateſt prince of y• worlde, and I wolde
be vnto thee (euē as I haue ben here to fore) a very frind
and a faythefull ſeruante, which thou mayeſt eaſyly vnderſtād
by theſe my exhortacions. And I doe aſſure thee
(that althoughe I haue defendid me againſt y•) I am thy
frynde, and I promeſſe thee that yf thou doe this, where
vnto I doe exhorte thee, which is to becomme Chriſtian
that I wyll not onely reſtore vnto the that parte which
thou requireſt at my hand, but alſo all myne owne that
I doe poſſeſſe in the worlde, and wylbe duringe lyfe thy
truſtie ſeruante: otherwyſe, I doe aſſure thee that I may
not doe it for anye perſwaſion that thou mayeſt vſe, and
chiefely for that the Turckes be alwayes enemyes to y•
Chriſtianes, and euel neighbours alſo, wherfore I wyl

not put that in hazarde which god hath gyuen me, and
maruell not at it, for it is my ryghte, and not thyne, to
poſſeſſe that which dothe appertaine to the Chriſtians,
althoughe it dyd not apertaine to my father, it is myne
for that I am a Chriſtian and haue lawfully recouered
it wt my ſworde in my hand. This alſo ſhoulde prouoke
thee to becomme Chriſtian, for that the poſſeſſion of the
townes, and the gouernement dothe apertaine (to the
Chriſtianes, and not to the infydelles) wherfore againe
I beſeche thee, that thou wylte becomme Chriſtian, for
otherwyſe I wyll contynually moleſte and annoye the
in all that I maye, and I hope rather to take from the ye
which thou vſurpeſt of the Chriſtianes, then to yelde in
to thy handes one handful of grounde. And as touching
thyne othe that thou haſte made 
                     〈…〉
                   me oute of my
countre, and that yf I be not ſlayne, I ſhall at the leaſte
be enforced to ſerue other men, vnto this I aunſwere, y•
yf I were not a Chriſtian, I durſte not encountre thee:
but cōmitting my ſelfe into ye tuytion of God, in whoſe
handes are ſtates, and kingdomes, I ſaye vnto thee, y• I
haue an aſſured hope to defende me agaynſte thy greate
power, where with thou haſt threatned me, and yu maieſt
well thincke, that victorie conſyſtethe not in number of
men, but in hauing god, and righte of his ſyde, and then
in the vertue of the ſouldiours and diſipline & iudgemēt
of the leaders,Note here thinges of great importance. and yf hit hervnto we haue poſſeſſyd all
theſe thinges aforeſayd, as I doe belyue thyne owne people
haue or nowe witneſſyd, wherfore to conclude I ſay
that nother thy ſugred perſwaſiones, ne yet thy cruell
threatings maye alter what I haue ſayde, but yf that yu
wylte becomme a Chriſtian, I ſhall then be enforced to
al that thou haſt required of me, further more I promiſe
vnto thy highnes, that I wyll not enuade anye parte of
thy dominions, onles that thy people doe firſte begyn.
And thus I commende me vnto thee, in ſuche ſorte as
ſhal pleaſe thee, frō oure campe, the xiiii. of Iuly. 1444.
               When y• ambaſſadour was departed with this letter,
Scanderbeg called vnto him all his Captaines, and declared
vnto them in order what the Turcke had wryten
vnto him, and in what ſorte, he had aunſwered hym

wherof they were all very glad, and hoped, that their affares
ſhoulde haue good yſſue, vnto whom Scanderbeg
ſpake afterwarde in this ſorte.
               My deare companiones in armes, I doe beleue that as
ſone as the Turcke ſhall haue conſydered my letter,Scan ſpeaketh to his ſouldiours. and
herde his ambaſſadour, he wyl immediatly determine to
emploie againſt me al his force poſſyble, and therfore it
is neceſſarie, that we be prouided, to the ende that we
maye defende oure ſelues,The order which Scanderbeg giueth to his ſouldiours. and alſo that we be vigillante
and attentiue, obſeruing ſuche order as I ſhall appointe
vnto you, which is, that we contynue together alwaye
in armes, and contynually whiles we eate, or ſleape, our
horſes to ſtande brydled, and ſadled, and that euery man
with his horſe alſo kepe that place of ye ſquadrone, wherin
he ſhall fyghte.

                  nd when the ordinarie tyme ſhall
comme to gyue them prouender, to gyue it then in litle
ſackettes and then to hange their brydles vpon the pomelles
of there ſadles whiles they eate, to the ende that
yf the enemyes ſhoulde comme vpon y• ſoodden to aſſaile
vs, we mought be ſone in order redie to aūſwere them
and beſydes that, I wyl alwayes haue wtoute my campe
a good garde, for that they ſhal not ſurprins vs, wherfore
I wolde that you ſholde wel obſerue this order but
forſomuche as I am certaine, that as yet no enemie wil
offend vs, I wyll that euery man departe to his dwellinge
place, and prouide him ſelfe of neceſſaries: and repoſe
him ſelfe, for I wil forthewt, with myne ordinarie
bands goe to ye confines of my coūtrey: and wil there lye
nowe in one place, and then in an other, and wyl holde
the enemies in doubte, & when it ſhalbe nedful to fighte
I wyl ſend you worde, and when ſo euer we ſhal encoū
                  tre
with the enemie, let this commaundement remaine
alwaies with you, that no man paine of lyfe take anye
ſpoyle, ſo longe as one enemie ſhal make hedde againſt
vs, vntyl the battayle be ended for I ſaye vnto you that
a man that is loded with bagage can neuer fighte worthilie.
And therfore I gyue you to vnderſtande, that I
wilbe obeid, and what ſo euer he be that like the not this
let him remaine here, and not goe with me, and when
that god at anie time ſhal giue vs victorie I promiſe you

as a faitheful ſouldiour, that al the ſpoile ſhalbe yours.
Then with greate reuerence, and humanitie, the Captaines
and chiefe ſouldiours aunſwered, that what ſo euer
he wolde commaunde ſhoulde be done, and then euery
man toke leaue and retorned to his dwelling place
and Scanderbeg with his two thouſand choſen horſemē

battayle, he neuer ſayde to his ſouldiours, on good felowes,
but folowe me, he was alwaies the firſte in giuing
the charge, and the laſte that retorned from it, his ſouldiours

were richely apparelled, in ſylke and golde, but
he wore alwaies courſe clothe, onles it were vpon ſolē
                  pne
feaſtes then he wolde ſhewe him ſelfe very richely
apparelled.
               Whyleſt Scanderbeg was in this ſorte vpon his confines,
there came a ſpyale vnto him, declaringe that the
Turcke (vnderſtanding that he had diſolued his armie &
licenſed them to repoſe them at their houſes, & howe y• he
with a fewe ſouldiours with him laie vpon the confines
of his countre) had cōmaunded Feriſbeg one of his Captaines
to take with him .ix. M. Turckes, horſemen, and
to departe with al ſpede towarde the frontiers to take
Scanderbeg vnprouided, and the ſpial was of opinion ye
they wolde be with him that daie, when Scanderbeg vnderſtode
of this, he ſent for no aide, but made him redie
with al ſpede poſſible with his two thouſande horſemen
and one thouſand fotemen embattailed, and then taried
his enemies,Battayle betwene Feriſbeg and Scā. and as ſone as they came, he ſigned him
ſelfe with the ſigne of the croſſe, and charged them with
ſuche furie, that althoughe the Turckes reſiſted for a
time, yet in the ende they were diſordered & put to flight
Feriſbeg Baſſa aforeſaide, gallopped vp and downe the
feelde, and with manie iniuriouſe wordes chanlenged
to fighte with Scanderbeg, he of the other parte commaunded
to folowe the chaſe, and to execute by al meanes
poſſible, and went forthewith and encountre with
Feriſbeg, and ſlewe him at the firſt ſtroke that he gaue,
with the which, the feare of the Turckes ſo encreaſed, y•
happie was the formoſt man, when this was done, Scā
                  derbeg
retorned with the victorie to his confines,A cuſtume of a good Captaine and
the nexte daie folowing he entred the Turckes coūtrey
and brought an exceding great proie from thence.
               When the Turcke vnderſtode theſe doleful newes,
he appointed forthewith and other Sangiacho named
Muſtaffa, and made him his Captaine general of .x. M,
Turckiſhe horſemen, with commiſſion not to encountre
Scanderbeg, but to enter his countrey by an other waie
and to ſpoile, and proie the ſame, but Scanderbeg hauīg
intelligence hereof, and of the place: where the Turcks
determyned to enter, he forthe with made him redie and

ſent for two thouſand horſemen moe,Good foreſyghte of Scā. which made in nū

4. thouſand horſemē, and one thouſand foremen, &
with theſe he went as ſecretly as poſſyble, to imboſque
him ſelfe neare to that place where the Turckes determined
to begyn their forcy, and as ſone as they were
comme thyther, they began to ſcatter ouer al the countrey,
and Scanderbeg toke his tyme and charged them,
and there began a cruel fighte on both ſydes, but in the
ende Scanderbeg with his ſouldiours, ſo behaued him
ſelfe,Muſtaffa de

the greateſt number of them were ſlayne vpon the place
and Muſtaffa their Captaine with certaine of his principal
ſouldiours fled, there were ſlaine of Scanderbeg ſouldiours.
xx. vpon the place, in the ende of this rencountre
al the ſpoile was preſented to Scanderbeg, who diſtributed
al to his ſouldiours, and then licenſed ye two thouſand
horſemen that came laſt, and with the reſt he retorned
againe to his accuſtumed confines.
               The Turcke for all this lefte not, but ſent Muſtaffa
afore ſaid with a greater companie then before, to ye confines
of his countre, with commiſſion not to ſturre from
thence withoute a ſpecial commaundement from him,
but that he ſhoulde ſtande wel vpon his garde and loke
diligently that Scanderbeg dyd not endomage his people,
and ſpoile his countrey, which when Scanderbeg vnderſtode
he determined alſo not to moue, onles that the
Turckes dyd firſte begyn, but ſtode alwaies vpon his
garde acordinge to his order, in this meane tyme there
came newes to Scanderbeg that leche Ducagino fonne
to the lorde Paulo had ſlaine Leche Zacharia lorde of ye
Citie called the Dagnio whiche ſtandethe in Albania
neare vnto the Ryner call Drino, for whoſe death Scanderbeg
was very ſory, for y• there had ben alwaye gréate
fryndſhippe betwene them, and for that he dyed withoute
children Scanderbeg determyned to ſuccede hym
in his ſtate after ye deceaſe of the ladie Boſſa his mother
by vertue of certaine couenantes ye were betwene them
notwithſtanding the Ladie Boſſa by meane of the lieutenante
of Scutari agreed with the Senate of Veniſe,
vpō certaine conditions, and delyuered them ye Dagnio

with the reſt of her ſtate, for the which Scanderbeg was
greatly offendyd and aſſembled al hys power and went
in perſon and beſeged Dagnio, and lefte (not withſtanding)
vpō his confines his truſtie frind the countye Vurana
one of his Captaines for the garde therof, wt thre
thouſand ſouldiours, when the lieutenante of Scutarie
vnderſtoode this, he aduertized the Senate therof, and
receaued commiſſion from them to leuie an armie, wher
vpon he toke oute of Scutarie many bandes of Italians
and leuied a great number of Albaneſes and made general
of the armie: the worthie Damel Sebenico, & as ſone
as he had al thinges redie he marched towarde Scanderbeg,
who as ſone as he herde hereof, paſſed the ryuer
Drino with al his armie, to goe towarde the Venetian
armie and to encoūtre them, and then ſpake to his ſouldiours
in this maner that foloweth.Scan. to his ſouldiours.
               
               My compainons in armes, if it be ſo that a man maye
lawfully demaunde his righte withoute doing wronge
to anye man, truely in that, that I haue demaunded my
righte, and beſeged Dagnio, and taken the ſtraicte or
valley therof, I doe beliue, I haue done no iniurie at al
to the Senate of Veniſe, but am rather wronged, notwtſtanding
I haue them partely excuſed, conſideringe the
falſe information that hath ben made vnto them in the
abſence of the contrarie partie, and truely I can not perſwade
my ſelfe, but that they being iuſt, and moſt Chriſtian,
and knowing the great affection and good wyl ye
I haue alwaye borne them, wolde neuer haue concluded
in my preiudice: yf they had firſt vnderſtode my right,
notwithſtanding, for that they haue nowe addreſſyd
their armie againſt me, we muſt nedes this daye fighte
againſt the Chriſtians, which in dede is greatly againſt
my wyl, wherfore nowe I ſay vnto you that it behoueth
you to fighte more circumſpectly and valiantly then you
haue done at anye tyme els, conſydering that you haue
to doe with men that doe farre excede the Turcks in valewe,
but yet I hope in God that the victorie ſhalbe ours
wherfore I doe commaūde you, that when we ſhal haue
broken them, that no man after that, ſley anye of them,
but to take them priſoners and to folowe the chaſe euen

to the gates of Scutari, and when he had thus ſayd, he
ſpake on highe,The bettayle betwene Scan & the Venetianes. ſainge, folowe me, and then marched on
with his armie in battayle and ioyned with the Venetianes,
the fighte betwene them was contynued wt great
obſtinatie, but in the ende Scanderbeg diſordered them
and put them to flighte, folowing the chaſe euen to the
gates of Scutari, and dyd ſley none of them in the chaſe
but toke a great number priſoners, and eſpecially men
of acompte, which were al preſented to Scāderbeg, who
lyke a noble prince cauſed them al to be wel entertained
& ſent them home wit houte any ranſom, & of al thoſe
priſoners be cauſed to detēyne two men of acompte, the
one was Simone Vulcatal, of the countrey of 
                     •
                   cutari
and the other was Andre Humoi brother to ye Captaine
of Croia, which he ſent into his owne countrey, & kepte
them priſoners in a forte of his ye was of great ſtrength
called Pietra Bianca, where they were by his cōmaunded
very wel vſed and had great prouiſion appointed vnto
them, after this Scanderbeg paſſed with his armye
throughe al the countre which appertained to the Venetianes,
thinckinge to haue taken it, but he coulde not,
whervpō he fortified a raſed Citie, name Balezzo, which
had ben diſtroied by Attilla Flagello di Dio, he fortified
it with walles, trenches, and baſtiōnes, he furniſhed it
with al kinde of menition, and valiante men, and he appointed
to be their Captaine one of hys Captaynes named
Marino Spā, a man of muche worthynes, to ye ende
that he ſhoulde with contynual courſes ſpoyle,Iudgemēt of Scanderbeg. and impoueriſhe
the countre, & kepe them in continual doubte.
And when he had eſtabliſhed this order he retorned to ye
ſeege of Dagnio. After this they of Scutari, vnderſtanding
ye Marino Span was gone forthe of Balezzo, they
went thyther with al ſpede, and ſpoyled the Citie to the
very foundation wherwith Scanderbeg beinge greatly
offendyd deſtroied al the countrey of Scutari.
               When the Turcke venderſtode that Scanderbeg had
warres with the Venetianes, and conſydering that that
countre laie betwene two mighty enemies, he was excedinly
glad thinckinge for that the Venetianes were of
great force, that they wolde ſone chaſe Scanderbeg oute

of his countrey, wherefore he ſent commaundement to
Muſtaffa, which laye vpon his cōfines, with xv. M horſemen
to goe, and ſpoyle al Scāderbegs countre, yet for al
that, Muſtaffa canſydering the bandes that Scāderbeg
had lying vpon his frontiers in redynes, wolde goe no
furder then that place, which is called Dronich where
he ſet vp his tentes, and lying with his armie encamped
there, he helde the countrey in contynual feare, wherof
as ſone as Scanderbeg had aduertizement, he departed
from Dagnio with two thouſand ſouldiours, and went
to his other thre thouſand ſouldiours, that laye vpō his
confines: and whē he had exhorted them to behaue themſelues
valiantly, he put them in order & aſſailed ye Turckes
with ſuche furie, that within a ſhorte tyme he put
them to flighte,Muſtaffa defeicted. and ſlewe .x. M. of them, and toke Muſtaffa
with .xii. others, men of great acompte, whom he
cauſed forthewith to be ſent, where Andre and Simon
was, and then made a greate courſe into the Turckes
countre, & broughte with him a maruelouſe riche proie,
and diſtributed al to his ſouldiours, and gaue amonge
them afterwarde .xxv. M. ducates whiche he had for the
ranſome of Muſtaffa and ye other xii. When Scanderbeg
had done this, he retorned to Dagnio, & helde that
countre in ſuche trauaile, that he broughte it al vnder
his obedience, yet notwithſtanding the Cities defended
them ſelues, and chiefely Driuazzo, whyles Amesabeg
Nephewe to Scanderbeg, ſpoiled the countre about Drinazzo,
the worthy Andre ſurnamed Angelo, deſcended of
the Romanes, whiche in tyme paſſed poſſeſſed the
Empire of Conſtantinople, beinge Captaine of Driuaſ
tynes, yſued oute of the towne with ſuche furie, and asſayled
the armie of Scanderbeg ſo worthily, that he put
them to flyghte with great ſpoyle of them, ſo that after
that, it was alwaies ſaid that Scāderbeg was alwaies
victoriouſe, onles it were before Driuaſto, but his excuſe
was, for that he was not preſent at that rencoūtre.
               In the ende Scanderbeg made peace with the Venetianes,
vpō condition that he ſhoulde reſtore vnto them
al thoſe places that he had taken from them, and in recompence
therof, he ſhoulde haue one part of the valey

or ſtraſcte of Scutari, begynninge at the bancke of the
ryuer Drino towarde Scutari, and ſo ſtretching oute to
a certaine place called Buſgiarpeni, which portions in
dede were much more cōmodiouſe for Scanderbeg, then
the towne of Dagnio.
               When this agrement was made, Scanderbeg ſpake
to the ambaſſadour of Veniſe in ſorte as foloweth, right
honorable my lorde ambaſſadours, it is the opinion of
ſuche as are wyſe where a man louethe once in dede, he
muſt nedes loue alwaie, and peraduenture the prouerbe
hathe herof his begynninge, whiche ſaythe that the diſcorde
of frinds: engendreth an increaſe of good wil, wherfore
I gyue your honours to vnderſtande, that notwithſtanding
oure difference I haue ben alwaie wel affected
towarde my lordes of Veniſe, for ſo muche as their ſtate
is moſt Chriſtian, and that they are fryndes of al kynde
of vertue, wherefore I wolde not ſuffer at the battaile of
Scutari (the victorie once beinge myne) to ſley anye moe
of their ſouldiours, and to the ende that it ſhall be well
ſeen that I am their frinde in dede, I ſhal holde me wel
contentyd and ſatiffyed with anye thinge that maye be
commodiouſe to their ſtate, and for that they ſhall well
vnderſtande that I make leſſe acompte of mine owne cō
                  modities,
then of thers, I doe make them a preſēt of al ye
which is mine for the which we haue had this difference
and doe holde my ſelfe as wel cōtented, as if I had them
contynually in my poſſeſſion, and furder, I wyl them
not to feare the Turcke, for I truſte in God to defende
bothe their ſtate, and myne owne alſo, and thus I commende
me to your honours. When Scāderbeg had this
ſayd, he embraced the ambaſſadours & retorned into hys
countrey, when he came thither, he cauſed to take oute
of priſon, Simon and Andre aforeſayd, and when he had
delyuered them, he did them great honor and gaue them
great preſentes, in token of the goodwyl that he bare to
the Senate of Veniſe.
               At that ſame tyme Scanderbeg made a great courſe
into the Turckes countrey, and burned and ſpoyled al ye
countre as he paſſed thorowe, and brought a great proie
from thence: whervpon the Turcke called vnto him, all

his conſellours called in the Turckiſhe tonge, Veſtri, &
alſo his Baſſas, Sangiachi, Captaines, and others of
his principall order of ſouldiours, and ſpake vnto them
in this ſorte.
               I am maruelouſly troubled and amaſed, with the manifolde
dāmages, and diſhonours that I haue receaued
at the hande of Scanderbeg, my mortal enemie, wherfore
I doe nowe determyne to be reuenged & to employe
al my force poſſyble againſt him, and ſo muche the more
for that I coulde neuer gyue him ouerthrowe, but he
hathe alwayes triumphed ouer my people, and ouer the
Venetianes alſo in one inſtante, and nowe (for that he
is a Chriſtian) he hathe made peace with them, and contynually
maketh warres againſt me, and maketh none
acompte of me at al, in ſo muche that he dothe not onely,
not determine to deliuer vnto me that which he hath
taken from me, but contynually threatnethe to ſpoyle
me (as he hathe al redie certyfyed me by his letters) of ye
reſte. Wherfore I doe determyne to make prouiſiō, and
to vſe my whole force againſt him, wherfore I giue you
to vnderſtande that I wyl goe thyther in perſon, & firſte
I wyl beſege the Citie of Croia and take it, and then al
the reſte of his ſtate, wherfore make you redie, for woe
ſhal he be, that is not redie at my muſtres, Scanderbeg
was ſpedyly aduiſed of this great preparatiō, and with
al ſpede furniſhed the Citie with al kynde of neceſſaries
and good ſouldiours, Albaneſes of great experience and
faith, he gaue them for their general Vurana aforeſaid
and he in perſon ſtode wel vpon his gard, in this meane
tyme there came a great number of Turckes into Scanderbegs
coūtre, and encampdd before Sfetigarde, a citie
that ſtandeth from Croia. 58. myles, when Scanderbeg
vnderſtode of this, he went forthewith as ſecretly as he
coulde and encamped within .vii. myles of ye Turckiſhe
armie, wt. 4. thouſand horſemen, & one thouſand fotemen
and being thus encamped wolde not ſuffer day nor
nighte any fire to be made within his campe by meanes
wherof the enemye vnderſtode nothinge of his beinge
there,Note. in this meane tyme Scanderbeg determyned to
put in vſe a Strategeme, whervpon he wylled the valiante

Moiſes,A Strategeme. and his Nephewe Muſachie de la Angelina
to take with them .xxx. horſemen, and to diſguiſe themſelues
and the nexte morninge to attempte as thoughe
they wolde goe into Sfetigard leadinge with them certaine
Aſſes loded with corne, & it was ſo done acording
to his commaundement, and in the morninge as ſone as
the garde of the Turcks campe ſawe them (thincking y•
they had ben victuallers) they haſted to encountre them
and when Moiſes with his companiones had fled a litle
waye, he torned and charged the Turckes and forthewt
ſlewe .viii. of them, and hurte manye: whervpon the reſt
ſuddenly fled and haſted them to the campe to declare
the newes, but the Baſſa beinge very circumſpecte miſtruſting
(as it was in dede) that they were no raſcalles,
conſyderinge the woundes, and great blowes that they
had gyuen, commaunded. 4. thouſand horſemen to folowe
them, and to take them lyuinge, Moiſes which alwaies
had regarde to his, ſeinge them comme began to
flee, and to hide him in a certaine depe valey, & the Turcks
folowed their tracte with great furie.Good prouidence of Scan. In this meane
whyle, Scanderbeg who dyd attende ſuche an occaſion,
furniſhed the entres of the valey and then with certaine
bandes with him, entred the valley and charged them, &
flewe the greateſt number of them, and the reſte fled in
maruelouſe diſorder, and had it not ben that the Baſſa
loked for Amorathe in perſon, he had then retorned againe
with al his armie into the Turckes countrey.
               After this the. 14 of Maye. 1449. this Tiran came
to his campe in Albania with. 160.Sfetigard beſeged by Amorathe thouſande Turckes,
with manie great bombardes, and a great quantie of other
artillerie, & beſeged Sfetigarde very ſtraitly, where
Pietro Parlato was Captaine, who with his ſouldiours
that he had oute of highe Dibra and the reſte that were
with him in that ſeege, behaued them ſelues ſo valiantly,
that althoughe they were contynually occupied in ye
defence of their towne, and in ſcaramoche, yet they alwayes
lefte with the beſt,Cyſteren a place wher in is receaued the rayne water. but in the ende a certaine traitour,
dyd caſte a ded dogge into their chiefe ciſterne of ye
towne, by meanes wherof the people were greatly conſumed,
and the Tiran Amorathe toke the towne, and in

the begynninge he dyd entertaine this traitour very honorably,
and gaue him greate preſentes, but after certaine
daies he was no more ſeen of anye, for in dede princes
doe oftē times loue the treaſon, but not the traitour
nor neuer truſte them after, and therfore it is not to be
maruelled at, that the Turcke ſeinge ſuche horible villanie
in a man, wolde neuer truſt him after, conſydering
that for his priuate lucre, he coulde be content to ſhed
not onely the bloude of his countremen, but alſo to deſtroie
his religion, and betraie his countre. After thys
Amorathe went and beſeged Croia rounde, and planted
his batteries and battered for the ſpace of. 4. montthes,
notwithſtandinge he did them of the towne ſmale hurte
for that the Citie was very ſtronge on euery ſyde, and yt
they had within the towne a plentuouſe fountaine of
goodly water, and an other very faire fountaine behind
the Caſtle, which the enemyes coulde neuer poſſeſſe. In
the meane tyme that the Turcke beſeged Croia in thys
ſorte, the noble prince Scanderbeg, nowe in one place &
then in an other, aſſayled the Turckes campe, and ſpoyled
contynually al ſuch victuallers as came to his campe
notwithſtandinge for that his number was very ſmale
he coulde not enforce them to rayſe their ſege. In ye ende
of ye fourthe monethe aforeſayde Amorathe commaunded
to gyue a general aſſaulte to ye towne and to aſſayle
it rounde in the whiche he preuayled not, but retorned
from the aſſaulte with great ſpoyle and loſſe of his people,the death of Amorathe.
for the whiche he toke ſo greate an inwarde grefe yt
forthewith he died. Then the ſoroweful, amaſed diſhonored,
and confounded Turckiſhe armie, abandoned ye
ſege, and retorned home in great diſorder, and were folowed
and ſpoyled in manye places as they paſſed, and
were very euel handled, in ſuch ſort, as they came home
greatlye diminiſhed, and Scanderbeg remained in hys
countre with great triumphe and victorie, contynully
praiſinge the Almightye God.
               When Amorathe prince of the Turckes was deade
Mahomethe his ſonne ſucceded him in his kingdome, he
that was ſōne to Hierenia, or Cataguſma, daughter to
George the Diſpotto of Seruia, and for that he was not

yet ſuerly eſtabliſhed in his ſeate, he coulde doe no great
hurte, wherfore Scanderbeg (beinge deſyrous to leaue
ſomme heire of his boddie after him) toke to wyfe that
excellent faire, & vertuouſe ladie named Doneca, daughter
to Aranithe Conino, but as ſone as Mahomethe the
newe Turckyſhe prince was eſtabliſhed in the ſeate of
his father, he began immediatly to threaten Scāderbeg
and coulde not endure that he ſhoulde poſſeſſe Croia, &
Epirro, then Scanderbeg with his. 2. thouſand horſemen,
and a thouſand fotemen, which were his ordinarie
garde, went to his confines, determyning not to enuade
at all, onles that Mahomethe fyrſte began, and being in
this ſorte vpon his cōfines he vnderſtode that ye Turcke
had no armie in redynes to ſend againſt him, and conſydering
that it was nedeful to viſyte his countre, he toke
with him his aforeſaide wife, and made a viſitaciō in his
countre, myniſtring Iuſtice in ſuche ſorte, with mercy,
that he was bothe honored, loued, and feared, of both
                     •
                  
more and leſſe, a man mought ſafely haue gone through
all that countrey with horſes loded with golde & no mā
wolde haue touched it. After this Scanderbeg ſent for a
great number of maſonnes and laborers, and went to
a certaine highe mountaine ouer the which there liethe
awaye that leadethe from Turchie downe into the coū
                  tre
of Scanderbeg, and vpon the heighte of the ſame
mountaine he buylded a forte of an excedinge force, and
named it Medriſſa, and then furniſhed it with all kynde
of neceſſaries and a good garde of fotemen, which ſholde
at all tymes when they ſawe the power of the Turcke
comme, ſhote of certaine peces of Artillerie to aduertize
the countre of their comminge, to the ende that they
moughte be redye to defend them ſelues, when Scanderbeg
had in this ſorte fyniſhed, and furniſhed his forte, he
paſſed on with his armie to his wonted confynes, but
fyrſt he entred the Turckes countre and ſackaged it putting
al to fire and ſworde withoute compaſſion.
               Then the aforeſayde Mahomethe prince of ye Turckes,
deſyring greatly the vtter ruyne and ſpoyle of all ye
countre of Scanderbeg, ſent againſt him a worthy Captaine
of his named Ameſabeg, with .xii. 
                     〈◊〉
                   choſen

Turckes on horſebacke and as ſone as this moſt vigillante
Scanderbeg harde the ſounde of the cannon, he
lept forthewith on horſe, with his ordinarie thre thouſand
ſouldiours and paſſed on towarde the Turckes, &
as ſone as he was comme neare vnto them, he ſygned
him with his wonted ſigne of the croſſe, and with great
furie charged them,The battayle betwene Scā. and Ameſabeg and after that he had foughte
with them a certaine tyme, he enforced them to diſorder
and to flee, folowinge the chaſe with al ſpede poſſyble,
executinge the enemyes, with great terrour and force.
In the ende Ameſabeg was taken with dyuerſe other
Turcks of great acompte, and were preſented to Scanderbeg.
Thē Ameſabeg with teares ſpake to him in this
ſorte, Ah thou worthye Scanderbeg, thy highnes dothe
knowe righte well, that we doe eate the breade of oure
maiſter and lorde, wherfore wee can not but ſerue him,
wherfore we beſeche thyne honor to vſe, ſome kynde of
mercye & corteſy towardes vs, for the loue of God which
thou doeſt worſhyppe, & for al the vertues of ye ſame.
               Then Scanderbeg as a magnanime prince aūſwered
in ſuche ſorte, as he cauſed not onely the priſoners, but
alſo al thoſe that were preſēt with them to ſhede teares,
after that in token that he pardoned them of their lyues
he cauſed them all to eate at his owne table, and Ameſabeg
to eate at his owne meſſe and in one dyſhe wt him
and when he had in this ſorte comforted them he cauſed
them to be ſafely kepte, and appointed vnto them honorable
prouiſion. In the ende acording to the couenantes
betwene them, there were paied for Ameſabeg x. M. ducates,
and for the reſt .iii. M. and in this ſorte they were
delyuered. Then Scanderbeg called his ſouldiours vnto
him and acordinge to his cuſtume diſtributed theſe
ſommes of money vnto them, notwithſtanding certaine
of his chiefe ſouldiours who for their obedience towar
                  
                     ••
                  
him dyd not refuſe to receaue it, yet in his preſence
ſpake franckly and vnder correction, ſaying, that not to
ſeme to directe him, but to declare their opinion vnto his
highnes, maruellinge muche that he folowed not the
councell of the olde prouerbe, which ſayeth, deade men
doe make no warres, but that he did alwaies ſuffer his

enemyes ſo to depart with their liues, by meanes wherof
they mought retorne an other time and annoie them.
But Scāderbeg aunſwered them in ſuche ſorte, that he
ſatiſfyed them all very wel, but his concluſion was that
yf they came againe an other tyme, he wolde alſo take
them, and diſtribute their ranſome to his ſouldiours, &
alſo he partly excuſed them, for that they lyued by their
lorde, he ſayde it was reaſon that they ſerued him, when
theſe wordes of Scanderbeg came to the Turckes cares
and alſo his corteſye towarde all ſuche as were taken
priſonners, and howe that he toke ranſome of ſuche as
were riche, and gaue money to thoſe that were pore and
ſent them home freely to their countre, their common
voice was in all places that there was but one Scanderbeg
in the worlde, and after him their ſhoulde not cōme
ſuche an other, and in this ſorte it dyd growe into prouerbe
amongeſt them and contynuethe to this daye.
               When Mahomethe had receaued this difeicte, he ſent
forthewith an other Sangiacho named Debreambeg
for his generall, with .xiiii. M. Turckes, and as ſone as
Scanderbeg vnderſtode that they began to approche to
his confynes, he toke his horſe with his ſouldiours, and
rode in the nighte thorowe a great valey, and at the laſt
came vp the hill where the Turckes laie, withoute any
ſuſpection, and charged them vpon the ſudden, & whiles
his ſouldiours were fyghtinge with the Turckes he in
perſon went directly to the tente of the Captaine Debreambeg
and founde hym in order redie to comme forthe
whervpon he aſſayled him,Debreambeg ſlayne. and with his launce ſtrake
him clene throughe the belly, and then he retorned to
him, and with his ſworde ſtrake of his hed, & as ſone as
the Turckes vnderſtode of this, immediatly they diſordered
them ſelues & fledde, notwithſtandinge it proffyted
them ſmally for the greateſt nūber of them folowed
their Captaine Debream. Whē this was done Scāder
beg diſtributed the ſpoyle to his ſouldiours, and retorned
ſafely into his countre with all his ſouldiours, with
victorie and triumphe.
               After this Scanderbeg beinge muche offended with
Mahomethe prince of the Turcks: went and encamped

before a Citie of his called Belgrado (not that of Hungarie)
with .xiiii. M. ſouldiours on horſe and fote, & lefte
for the garde of his confynes a famous and worthy Captaine,
named Moiſes whiche was of highe Dibra, with
2. thouſand ſouldiours fotemen and horſemen, and whē
he had of a longe tyme continued his ſeege and batteries
Scanderbeg lefte his coſyn the lorde Muſachio Topia,
which was ſōne to the aforeſayd Andre: Captaine generall
of all his armie, before that towne, and appointed a
garde alwaie to be forth of his campe, to that ende that
the Turckes ſhoulde not take them vnprouided, & then
he departed from thence, and toke with him. 3. thouſand
horſemen, and a thouſand fotemen, and went to viſete
certaine places of his. In this meane tyme a Baſſa of ye
Turckes called Sebalia came with .xl. thouſand Turckes
to raiſe the ſeege, and hauinge by meanes of corruption
had intelligence, with thoſe traitours of the garde
that was withoute the campe, vnto whom he gaue an
exceding great ſumme of money, by meanes wherof the
garde ſuffred them to paſſe withoute gyuing any aduertiſement
to them of the campe therof, whervpon immediatly
they ſlewe the generall of the armie, Muſachio &
put all the campe to flyghte in maruelouſe diſoder, and
folowed them doinge great execution vpon them with
great noyſes and cries. And by the prouidence of God
Scanderbeg was alredie on horſebacke, comming to viſyte
his campe, with his. three thouſand horſemen, and
one thouſand fotemen, & as ſone as he herde this greate
noyſe, he ſuſpected the treaſon of the garde. Then he put
ſpurres to his horſe and with all ſpede came into hys
campe, where he ſawe the Turckes making great ſpoile
of his people, he charged them with ſuche force that in
maner in one inſtante, in diſpite of them, he made them
to leue of, ſauinge that one part of them contynued ſtyl
the chaſe: which ſo kyndled Scanderbeg, and his worthye
ſouldiours, that the force of the Turckes coulde by
no meanes ſtand againſt them,Sebalia, defeicted. but as they were wonte
torned their backes & fledde, towarde the Citie to their
greate ſhame. Then Scanderbeg lyke a worthye Captaine
thoughte it good no furder to folowe them, iudgeinge

it to be a great grace of God, y• he had ſo at an inſtante
delyuered his people from deathe, and therfore
ſounded the retreicte and paſſed into his countre ſafe, wt
honor, and whē he made a reuewe of his armie, he foūde
that there were flayne of his ſouldiours. 2. thouſande
horſemen, and. 3. thouſande fotemen, whiche for the
more parte, were comme oute of Apuglia with the aforeſayde
Muſachio his coſyn and Captaine generall, and
there were of them taken foure ſcore, which dyd muche
offende the mynde of Scanderbeg, within fewe dayes
after he ſupplied his armie, and went againe to ye ſeege
of Belgrado, but the Citizens and Turckes that were
within ſent an ambaſſadour to Scanderbeg, who behaued
him ſelfe ſo wyſely, that he contented Scanderbeg
in ſuche ſorte, that he retorned ſuddenly backe againe, &
diſſolued his armie.
               After this Scanderbeg with his. 3. thouſand horſe
men, & one thouſāde fotemen, retorned to his confynes
to his acuſtumed places, and when he came there, he licenſed
the. 2. thouſand ſouldiours which there were, vnder
ye conducte of ye aforeſaid Moyſes.
               This Moiſes for his vertues, and worthynes, was
ſo muche embraced and fauored of Scanderbeg, as anye
man that was with him: in token wherof Scanderbeg
had gyuen him many townes, and great poſſeſſyones,
armours, weapones, horſe, aparell, Iuelles, clothe of
golde, and ſylke, with great ſummes of money, notwithſtandinge
after this ouerthrowe of Scanderbegs people
this Moyſes was oute of hope that euer Scanderbeg
ſhoulde be able to defende his countre, whervpon he began
to contemne him, and lefte his ſeruice and went to
the Turcke aforeſayde,Moyſes reuoltethe. and offered him to chaſe Scanderbeg
oute of his countre, ſo that he wolde delyuer him
xv. thouſand choſen Turckes: with this condition, that
when he had baniſhed Scāderbeg, that then he mought
remaine lord of the contre, painge yerely to the Turcke
ſuch tribute as he ſhoulde thincke good to appointe him
to paie. This offer pleaſed the tiran maruelouſly and he
gaue vnto him very attentiue eare: and aunſwered Moiſes,
that yf he coulde bringe that to paſſe, he wolde furniſhe

him in euery reſpecte, and graunte him all his demaundes,
and for that that Moyſes ſayde that he wolde
fley Scanderbeg, and wolde challenge him openly to
fyghte with him vpon the feelde in ſynguler battayle, ye
Turcke promiſed him to gyue vnto him a hundred thouſande
ducates ſo that he broughte vnto him the head of
Scanderbeg, and alſo he wolde haue no tribute at all of
him for Scāderbegs countre: but it ſhoulde ſuffiſe him
to haue him obedient, faythefull, and his good frynde, &
for the greater aſſurance he commaunded to put al theſe
conditiones in writinge.
               Then Moyſes toke his iorney & paſſed on wt his xv.
thouſand choſen Turckes well monted, & came againſt
Scanderbeg thorowe Thracia, and Macedonia. As ſone
as Scanderbeg vnderſtode of this practiſe, he did vnite
his armie to the number of r. thouſande men, on horſe,
and fote, and went to tarie the comminge of Moyſes in
the plaines of the baſe Dibra. When Moiſes was cōme
into thoſe playnes and ſawe the armie of Scanderbeg
in ſo good order, he became euen amaſed, & went forthe
from his people, and with lowde voice challenged Scanderbeg
to fyghte with him in ſyngular battayle, vſynge
againſt him manye villanouſe wordes, but Scanderbeg
with more ſharpe voice aūſwered, ſaying, o thou rebelle
mete for the gallowes, tarie, and I wyll ſone make the
to repent thee of that, wherof thou thinckeſt not to repent
the at all, then manye of Scanderbeges ſouldiours
were muche offended with him and wolde haue gone
forthe oute of their ſquadrone to fyghte with him man,
to man, but Scanderbeg with incredible furie ſpurred
his horſe towarde him, ſo that they were bothe oute frō
their people, and as ſone as Moiſes behelde the troubled
there, and furiouſe countenance, of his lorde, he began
forthewith to flee, and retorned into his ſquadrone, and
Scanderbg folowed with great furie, but he coulde not
ouer get him wherfore he retorned to his people.
               Then when all thinges were in that order that he
wolde, he commaunded them with a lowde voice to folowe
him, and they all being alredie excedingly wrothe
folowed him, but he being in a greate furie was ye fyrſte

that ſtrake vpon them, and the Turckes were excedingly
amaſed to ſee that moſt ſhamefull flyghte of Moyſes
their Captaine,Moyſes defeicted. and almoſt with the fyrſt charge, were
put to flight, ſo that a fewe of them euer retorned home,
Moyſes went againe to the Turcke, but he was not only,
ſuffred to comme to his preſence, but alſo was greatly
laughte at: and ſkorned, and eſtemed to be a vile mā
                  and
of no worthynes. Then Moyſes became almoſt deſperate,
and began to diſcourſe in him ſelfe what he were
beſt to doe, he could finde no meanes wherby he mought
remedie his euell, in ſuche ſorte as he mought with his
honor ſhewe him ſelfe in anye place of the worlde, conſyderinge
that he had in this ſorte purchaſed the name
of a traitour, in the ende beinge moued in conſcience he
called to god for mercy: and then he was fully perſwaded
to put his truſte in God, and in Scanderbeg, who
had dyuerſe and ſondrie tymes pardoned penitent offendours.
Then he diſguyſed him ſelfe, and came into Albania
ſecretly, with a corde aboute his necke, caſting
him ſelfe downe at the feete of Scanderbeg with tremblinge,
and teares demaunded mercy. Then Scāderbeg
forthe with put forthe his hande, and toke him vp, and
began to diſcourſe with him, euen as thoughe there had
ben neuer anye offence made againſt him diſcourſing of
the practizes that the Turcke had framed againſt hym.
Then Scāderbeg commaunded to apparell him honorably,
and when they had ſupped he reſtored him to all his
liuinges & goodes that before were confiſcate, in token
that he had franckly pardoned him.
               After this when Scanderbeg ſawe Moyſes faithfull
and diligent in all his affares he receaued him into hys
faueur, as before, and accepted him better.
               When the Turcke vnderſtode the contynuall victorie
of Scanderbeg againſt him, and againſt his father
in his lyfe tyme, he gathered a great armie and ſent
Iſaahe, Baſſa of Romania, Captaine generall wyth
xl. thouſand men againſt Scanderbeg, & as ſone as they
were comme into his countre, Scanderbeg ſemed to be
in great feare and fiedde into Aleſſio a Citie of the Vene
tianes. Then the Turckes were oute of doute of Scanderbeg,

and ſo ran ouer his countre at their pleaſure, euen
to the very ſea, but they coulde rayſe no proie great
nor leſſer, for that he commaunded them before hand to
flee with their goods and cattell into places of force and
ſecuritie, ſo that the Turckes founde them ſelues greatly
deceaued and abuſed, the ſame nighte they lodged vpō
the ſyde of the ryuer called Mathia, and reſted them as
thoughe they had ben at home in their countrey, but
Scanderbeg enemye of all ſluggiſhenes, the daye folowinge
aboute nonne came with his. 7. thouſand horſemē
to a mountaine whiche ioyned to the plaine where they
encamped, & then with certaine of his Captaines went
vp to the toppe of the hill, to conſyder, and beholde in
what ſtrengthe his enemyes dyd lye, and whether he
moughte haue anye occaſyon to aſſayle them vpon the
ſudden. When Scanderbeg was vpon the heighte of the
mountaine, he ſawe the Turckes lying withoute garde
vnder the trees in ſhodowe, and in their tentes, for it
was in the hoteſt tyme of the ſommer, and in the myddeſt
of the daye: wherfore he departed from the mountaine
and went to horſe with all his ſouldiours and began
to ryde in greate haſt towarde the Turckes, & met
with their ſcoute, and ſlewe them immediatly al ſauing
one, who with the ſpede of his horſe eſcaped to ye campe
crying in this ſorte Scanderbeg is bere, Scanderbeg is
here. But Scāderbeg in perſon folowed him, and coulde
not ouergett him for that he had ſo muche groūde before
him at the firſt. Then Scāderbeg cōmaunded to ſownde
the alarme with all ſuche inſtrumentes as they had and
then gaue in vpon them with ſuche force (vnprouided as
they were) that in the fyrſt charge he put them in ſuche
diſorder, and flyghte as was meruelouſe to ſe, ſo that he
ſlewe of them there. 30. thouſād vpon the place, and all ye
euer ye Sangiacho Ameſabeg (neuewe to Scanderbeg &
rebelle againſt him) coulde doe or ſaye coulde not ſtaye
them from ronning awaye,Ameſabeg Meſithbeg taken. wherfore in the ende thys
ſame Ameſabeg, with Meſithebeg, bothe Sangiachi, wt
500. Turckes moe were taken priſoners, and Iſaach
the Baſſa,Iſaacke Baſſa put to flighte. with ſuche ſcatered Turckes as were lyuing
fled and was folowed for a certaine tyme and great execution

done vpon his people. After this Scanderbeh deuided
the ſpoyle to his ſouldiours, acording to his acuſtumed
order, there were ſlayne of his ſouidiours. 60.
               This done he retorned to his confynes, and made acourſe
into the countre of his enemies and ſacaged it, &
burned a greate parte therof, and retorned into his countre
with an exceding great boutie ſafely, & gaue thancks
to God for his great victorie.
               The Turcke reſted not for this but ſent newe bands
to garde his confynes with two other Captaines, ye one
of them was named Hannebeg, and the other Sinanbeg
with expreſſed commaundement not to deale with Scanderbeg,
nor to enter his countre, onles they receaued frō
him other commiſſyon, and this he dyd for that he ſawe
he coulde not ouercome Scanderbeg, and therfore he determyned
to proue yf he moughte preuayle againſt ſome
other princes, wherfore he toke in hand fyrſt the enterpriſe
againſt the Imperiall Citie of Conſtantinople, &
in ſhorte tyme toke it, flewe the Emperour therof with
an infinite number of Citizens and other Chriſtians, &
then conquered al his ſtate, in the yere. 1453. After this
he went againſt the afore named Diſpotto of Seruia, a
prince of great welthe poſſeſſinge a maruelous maſſe of
golde and ſiluer by meane of certaine mines that he had
not withſtandinge, he chaſed him oute of his countre, in
the yere. 1459.The king of Boſſina put to deathe in miſerable ſorte. After this he went againſt the kinge of
Boſſina, and toke him & cauſed him to be ſawed a ſonder
in the middeſt, and toke his ſtate.
               Then Scanderbeg beholdinge the great proſperitie
of his enemye (in the preiudice and ſubuerſion of the Catholique
faithe, threating alſo to take the countres of dyuerſe
Chriſtian princes) determined to goe and encoūtre
with the two Captaines aforeſayd.
               In this meane tyme the ambaſſadours of the pope
Pio the.Faro the ſtraite at Miſena betwene Scicill & the maine land of Italie. 2. and of the kinge Ferrante kinge of Puglia,
and of Scicile, paſſed the Fero and went to Scanderbeg
ſaying, moſte noble prince, we gyue thyne excellentie to
vnderſtande in the behalfe of oure lordes, and Maſters,
that the Duke Iohn, ſōne to the king Renato of Fraūce
is comme with a great power of Frenſhe men, into the

kingdome of Sicille againſt your deare frinde the king
Ferrante, and there are reuolted againſt the kinge (takinge
parte with the aforeſayde Duke) the princes of
Taranto, and Boſſano, with the greateſt part of the nobilitie
of that kingdome, and he hathe entertained in his
paie ye Coūtie Iames Piocinino with all his regiment
ſo that his armie is very great and ſtronge, and he hath
alredie conquered the whole kingdome, ſauinge onelye
Napls, Capua, Auerſa, Gaieta, Troia, and Barletta,
where the king is nowe ſtraitely beſeeged, and in daunger
to be taken, and the power of the pope and ye kinge
can not paſſe ouer to ſuccour him, wherfore the popes
hollynes, and oure kinge alſo, deſyre your highnes in
moſt erneſt wiſe, that it maie pleaſe you to comme into
Puglia in his fauour, and when the ambaſſadours had
this ſayde they preſented vnto him the popes bulles wt
the kinges letters, wherin there was conteyned ye lyke
of that, which they had declared by mouthe.
               Then Scanderbeg beinge greatly affected towardes
the popes hollynes, and the holly catholique churche of
Rome, and for that alſo he was entred into great fryndſhippe
with the kinge Alfonſo, father to Ferrante, fermer,
and tributarie to the aforeſayde Byſhoppe, he determyned
to ayde him with all his power poſſyble, and
ſo after great entertainemēt made to the ambaſſadours
he licenſed them in very corteſe ſorte, and forthe wt ſent
one of his chiefe Captaines his Nephewe, named Cairo
Stroiſio, a man of great vnderſtandinge, and worthines
with. 500. choſen horſemen, who paſſed the ſea, and landed
in that parte of the countre that yet helde for the
kinge Ferrante, where he dyd great good by meanes of
his worthines.
               In the meane ty
                     •
                  e Scanderbeg made a treues forone
yere with the T
                     ••
                  cke, by meanes wherof he had as
good oportunitie as he coulde haue wyſhed for ſo muche
as ſhortely before the ariuale of the ambaſſadours aforeſayd,
there came a meſſager from ye Turcke, to demaūde
peace of Scanderbeg, but he was departed wtoute graūt
therof, for he was fully determyned to deale with the
Turckes Captaines that laie vpon the confynes, but

as ſone as he vnderſtode of this, he ſent his curreuers after
the ambaſſadour and cauſed him to retorne, and then
concluded the aforeſaid trewſe.
               After this he committed his ſtate into the handes of
his welbeloued wife, and others, his moſt faithful frinds
and appointed to defend them a worthie Captaie with
ſufficient number of ſouldiours, and when he had hired
a greate number of ſhyppes, and galleys and other veſſelles
for ye ſea, he cauſed his armie to embarcke in them
beinge well furniſhed of horſes and courſers of greate
price, and with aboundance of virtuall, and then he cauſed
them to ſet ſaile: and in ſhorte ſpace he arriued at Raguſio,
and he with certaine with him landed there, and
was by the chiefe of that place honorably receaued. And
when they had a longe tyme talked together, he wente
to the churche to heare ſeruice, and then toke his leaue
and went aborde and ſet ſayle, & hauinge a proſperouſe
wynde, in ſhorte tyme approched neare to Barletta, &
when the Duke Iohn, and the countie Iames and the
reſt of the nobilitie, ſawe ſo manye ſayles, they Iudged
Scanderbeg to be there, for it was bruted that Scanderbeg
wolde comme and ayde the kinge, whervpon they
rayſed their campe and went to encampe at a certaine
place from thence, farre of. In this meane tyme Scanderbeg
landed, and the kinge forthewith went oute of
Barletta and came and embraced Scanderbeg, weping
for ioye, gyuinge thanckes to God, and then to him, for
ſo great corteſie, and grace, after this Scanderbeg cauſed
to vnſhippe his furniture, to comforte the king, and
all the reſt of his people: and the nexte morowe he rode
into the countre whiche had rebelled againſt the kinge
aforeſayde, and broughte from thence and exceding great
proie of cattell of all ſortes and draue it to Barletta, and
for the ſpace of all that daye, there was made great ioye
in hope of victorie, and the morninge folowing he made
an oration to his ſouldiours, in forme as foloweth.
               My deare frinds,Scan. to his ſouldours. the cauſe of oure being here as nowe
is to ayde and ſuccour the kinge Ferrante oure frynde,
whom in one momente by godes helpe, we haue delyuered
from a perillous ſege, hithervnto: wtoute drawing

oure ſwordes wherfore to make an ende of this enterpriſe,
it is nedefull to vſe oure weapones very ſkylfully,
and to kepe very good order, in ſuche ſorte, as the kinge
maye recouer the countre that he hathe loſte: whiche
thinge can not be done withoute gyuing battayle, fyghtinge
the ſame with great aſſurance, and in maruelouſe
perfecte and ſtronge order, but I thincke not that you
wyll doe otherwiſe here in Italie, then you haue done
in Albania againſt the Turcks, and other oure enemies
notwithſtandinge, this maye not be vnaduiſedly taken
in hande forſomuche as theſe the kinges enemyes, are
Italianes, and Frenſhe men and are armed ſuerly euen
from the hed to the fote, hauinge launces of great force
and ſtockes bothe ſtronge, and wel piercinge, wherfore
yf we ſhoulde ſtande fyrmly and receaue their charge,
they wolde handle vs very rudely, and we ſhoulde be able
ſmally to anoie them, for that oure armour is ſlender
in comparyſon of thers, we were Iackes of mayle,
Targes, longe and ſlender launces, and althoughe that
oure ſwordes and Scymytaries be heuy, and that ſome
of them wyll cut anye kynde of yron, yet all thys is in
maner nothinge, conſyderinge that their number dothe
farre excede ours, and they be men of greater vertue and
force then are the Turckes, wherfore with ſuche enemies
it behoueth vs to deale diſcretly and valiantly, puttinge
oure truſte in God to obtaine victorie, acording as
we are acuſtmed to doe, wherfore it behoueth you to obſerue
this order thorowly that I ſhall nowe gyue you,
we wyll goe and ſeke theſe the kinges enemyes, and
when we ſhall fynde them, we wyll withoute delaye offer
to charge them, & yf they wyll offer to countrecharge
vs, we wyll then ſeme to rone awaye, and after ye wyll
torne ſuddenly vpon them, for when they haue folowed
vs a lytle tyme, they wylbe ſone wery for they can endure
no great trauayle, for they are loded with heuy armour,
and their horſes are great, and heuye, and wylbe
ſone wery: but we are able to endure to the ende of anye
trauayle, and then wyll we with oure ſwordes, Scymytars,
and Maſes, ſo beate them aboute the heddes that
we wyll enforce them to fall from their horſes halfe dod

and vſing the matter in this ſorte there is no doubte but
that we ſhall obtaine the victorie, truethe it is for that
they are baptized, it greueth me muche, but there is no
remedie,Great blaſphemy for euery man is bounde to defende him ſelfe, &
we haue the ryghte on oure ſyde, and the popes bleſſing
and grace, who is lord of the whole worlde, both in ſpirituall,
and temporall matters, for that he is Chriſtes
lieutenante, wherfore I praie you and alſo commaunde
you, that euery man enforce him ſelfe (more nowe then
euer he dyd) to doe well, for that we are in a ſtrange coū
trey, and are enforced to obtaine this victorie for the glorye
of God, and the welthe and cōmoditie of oure frindes
and for oure owne honor, and to the loſſe and diſhonor
of oure enemies.
               The nexte morning folowinge Scanderbeg wt hys
ſouldiours, went with great aſſurance to ſe the kynges
enemies, and he attempted a ſcaramothe to ſe the maner
of his enemyes, and in what order they fought, but they
behaued them ſelues valiantly for a longe tyme,Iudgemēt of Scā. and in
the ende they wered werye, and there were xxx. of them
ftayne, and xx. taken priſoners, and of thoſe of Scanderbeg
there were only iiii. hurte, & in this ſorte Scāderbeg
retorned victoriouſly to Barletta.
               The nexte daye folowing in the morning, Scanderbeg
retorned againe to the enemyes determyninge to
fyghte with them all that day, and the nighte folowing
he deuided his armie into thre ſquadrones,The order of Scan. ye one of them
he wolde leave in perſon, the other he comitted to ye conducte
of Moiſes a notable Captaine of his, and the other
he gaue in charge to the countie Gintrizza his moſt valiante.
Nephewe, and he preſented theſe thre ſquadrones
and aſſayled the enemye in thre ſondrye places at once,
and the battayle continued all that daye and in the ende
the enemyes wered wery, wherfore, that moſt ſubtile
countie Iames determyned to fynde a remedie, for that
moſt eminent peryll wherin he was, and therfore wente
forthe of his ſquadrone, and with a lowde voyce called
ſayinge, moſt noble prince Scanderbeg, maye it pleaſe
the that I maye ſafely, comme to ſpeake with thyne excellentie
of matters that ſhall in no wyſe diſpleaſe the,

Scanderbeg aunſwered that he ſhoulde goe, and comme
ſafe vpon his faythe, then the countie replyed requiring
him that it moughte pleaſe him, to comme forthe of his
ſquadrone, and he wolde doe the lyke to the ende y• they
mighte talke together from their companies, whervpō
Scanderbeg withoute anye difficultie went forthe from
his ſquadrone acompanied with a fewe ſouldiours, and
when he came neare where the countie was, he cauſed
his ſouldiours to ſtaie a parte from him, then Iames
ſayde my lorde oure talke wyll require ſome tyme wherfore
maye it pleaſe your highnes that for this daye the
battayle ceaſe, and that commaundement be ſo gyuen
to bothe the armies, Scanderbeg was well contentyd,
then the countie was very glade and began to talke of
peace, and amitie, bothe to the honor of the kinge Ferrante
and alſo to the honor of Scanderbeg. And as they
were thus talkinge, Moyſes and Gintrizza, two of hys
Captaines broughte in foure ſquadrones of ſouldiours
which they had taken priſoners,Squadre of totemē 20. of men at armes 25. and preſented them to
Scanderbeg. Then the countie began to be affraied &
ſuddenly fayned a Iollitie, and ſayde he doubted not at
all, but truſted wholly in the prome
                     •
                   of Scāderbeg, who
aunſwered, beholde I gyue them all to you, notwithſtandinge
that they were all taken before the commaundement
was giuen to the armies, and then he cauſed them
to be ſet at libertie, in the ende. When Scanderbeg had
vnderſtode the opinion of the coūtie in certaine pointes
he aunſwered that it was nedefull to take good aduiſe,
vpon theſe matters, and to vnderſtande the kynges pleaſure
in that behalfe, and to giue aunſwere the nexte day
folowinge, when he had thus ſayde, they toke leue the
one of the other, for that it was very late. In ye meane
tyme as Scanderbeg made hym redye to goe towarde
Barletta, a ſouldiour of the counties came to Scanderbeg,
and ſhowed him that all the parliament that the
countye helde with him, was but very diſceite, onely to
to delyuer his armye which was ſo wery, that of neceſſitie
they muſt haue ben ouerthrowen, and alſo for that
he had practized with ſome of his ſouldiours, to ſe yf y•
they coulde betraye Scanderbeg, and take him lyuinge

and this was the onelye cauſe why he came forth in perſon
oute of his ſquadrone, for yf Scanderbeg had not gyuen
eare to him but contynued ſtyll the battayle, there
is no doubte but that he had ouerthrowen all the armie
for they were all redie ſo wery, that they were determyned
to yelde them ſelues. Then Scanderbeg more furious
then anye Lion, cried oute with a terrible voice ſayinge,
O y• moſte wicked murderer & thou countie Iames
thou traitour Ganio, was it not ſnfficient for the with
crafte and ſubtilitie in this ſorte to auoide the diſtruction
of thy flugguyſhe and vnproffitable armie, but that
thou muſte vnder pretence of ſo poyſoned a frindſhippe,
ſeke to betraie me whiche am innocent. Wherfore loke
well to thy ſelfe for to morowe thou ſhalte be recompenſed
for thy well doinges, when he had thus ſayde he departed
with his people, and went to Barletta, and when
he had ſupped he commaunded to gyue his horſes prouender,
and rewarded the ſouldiour that reueled this
matter, and departed in the night by the mone lighte wt
all his ſouldiours with him towardes the enemye, and
whē he came to the place where they encamped ye night
before, he founde all the armie gone, for Zachuria Groppa,
one of the countes ſouldiours declared vnto ye coūtie
euen as it came to paſſe, wherfore the counte with hys
armye departed with ſpede, and went to enrampe, to a
place that was farre of. Then Scāderbeg retorned, and
the nexte morninge he toke the kinge in companie with
him, and myngled their ſouldiours, to auoyde ſtrife, and
then went on folowinge the tracte of the enemie, and in
ſhorte tyme they diſcouered them, & he cauſed to marche
on the one ſyde Frederick Duke of Vrbine lieutenante
of the popes armie, and Alexandre Sforza lieutenante &
brother, to the Duke of Milane, who deſyred erneſtly y•
they mought ſo paſſe ouer, then whē they had al things
in order, they marched on to a Citie called Troia. The
Duke Iohn with the countie Iames and all his armye
were in a Citie called Nucera from Troia viii. myles, acordinge
to the meſure of Apulia, betwene whiche two
Cities their was a moūtaine called Segiano, frō Troia
two myles, and from Nucera viii. myles, Scanderbeg

therfore, knowinge that ye armies muſt fighte, betwene
thoſe two Cities, roſe vp in the nighte, and wt his ſouldiours
went and toke that hill, and furniſhed it wt men
ſufficient to defende it, to the ende that yf peraduenture
the kings power ſhoulde be ouerthrowen, they mought
take that hill and defend them ſelues, the coūtie Iames
who in dede was ſkylfull, and of greate experience in
warres, ment alſo to take the ſame hyll, and therfore he
departed alſo in the morninge betyme to take the hill, &
when he founde that Scanderbeg had alredye taken it
where with he was very ſorie, and ſayde to certaine of
his moſt truſtie frinds: that he was then oute of al hope
of victorie, notwithſtandinge he lefte not of for that, but
dyd in euery reſpecte the office and duetie of a good Captaine,
exhortinge and encoraginge his ſouldiours, puttinge
them alſo in order acordinge to the tyme, & place.
The nexte morning they determyned to gyue battayle
and made them redie on bothe ſydes, enbattayled their
people,The batbetwene the Duke Iohn and Scan. and encountred, the fyghte was betwene them
moſt terrible, and contynued tyll the euening in ye ende
the Dukes armie was ſo ouerthrowen, and ſpoiled, that
he was glad that he moughte retorne into Fraunce wt
ſhame, and diſhonor, and with the loſſe in maner of all
his Frenſhe bandes, in lykewyſe the countie Iames, wt
all the infortunate noble men of Apuglia, fled thorowe
moſt difficulte paſſages euery man his waye, and it was
the greate grace of god y• they eſcaped with their lyues.
Then the kynge was deliuered from his enemies with
great glorie, and triumphe, throughe the worthynes of
the magnanime, puiſſante, and victoriouſe prince Scanderbeg.
After this the aforeſayde king Ferrante, rode wt
Scanderbeg to ſee yf that he coulde recouer his Cities,
and townes, which he had loſte, he entred into Naples
in great triumphe, and afterwarde wente on their iorney
notwithſtanding, manye Cities, and townes continued
in their former purpoſe, and wolde in no wiſe obey
the king Ferrante, but ſayde that they wolde rather
dye with their weapones in their handes, then to yelde
them into his wycked handes, for they were wel aſſured
that he wolde be reuenged on them, and wolde obſerue

no promiſe with them, but they were contented to yelde
them to Scanderbeg vpon his faithefull promes, in the
ende when the kyng, and Scanderbeg had talked togyther,
it was agreed that the kyng ſhoulde ſwere to performe
all promes that ſhoulde be made in his name, and
that Scanderbeg ſhoulde promes his ſubiectes and aſſure
them therof: otherwyſe they wolde not yelde but
wolde fyghte it oute to the vttermoſt, for it ſemed vnto
him a thinge moſt vnſemely for a Chriſtian prince, to
breake his faythe, which is the ſeale of his ſaluation, &
euery Chriſtian is bounde to obſerue it, euen to his enemyes.
Then the kyng ſwore openly that he wolde performe
in euery reſpecte what ſo euer hys good father
Scan.The othe of kinge Ferrante. ſhoulde promiſe, when this was done, Scanderbeg
wente and aſſured them all that the kyng ſhoulde
performe his promes in euery reſpecte, and ſhoulde vſe
them all as his very fryndes, and louinge ſubiectes by
meanes wherof al places wherſoeuer he came yelded vnto
him, but as ſone as Scanderbeg entred into any place
he cauſed to ſet vp the enſeignes of the kinge Ferrante
and made them ſwere fidelitie, and obedience to ye king.
In this meane tyme Fuſano a Sicillian, a man of great
prowes, a rebell, and a mortall enemye to the kynge aforeſayde
was then in the Citie of Trani, in the forte
therof, and with the ſouldiours that he had, he made cō
                  tynuall
warres againſt the kyng Ferrante & dyd greatly
annoie him, wherfore Scanderbeg beinge muche moned
therwith, rote to Trani and toke it and Fuſano alſo,
who for that he wolde be ſet at libertie and mought
haue meanes to eſcape, commaunded his Nephewe to
yelde the forte into the handes of Scanderbeg. When
this was done, Scanderbeg ſet Fuſano at libertie and
ſuffred him to ronne his waye. When Scanderbeg had
recouered againe all the kynges Cities, townes, and
fortes, which were wonte to obey him, he went ſtraight
to the kynge and reſtored him to them al, praying with
great inſtancie, and modeſtie his highnes, to performe
and kepe all his promiſes which he had made to his ſubiectes:
which thinge the kynge promiſed, and fulfylled
for the great good wyll that he bare vnto Scanderbeg.

Then ye kyng cauſed to make ſoleme triumphes. Iuſtes
torneies, and huntings, with other ſumptuouſe ſhowes.
After this he gaue to all Scanderbegs Captaines, and
chiefe ſouldiours, great preſentes and giftes, & to Scanderbeg
he gaue certaine faire Caſtells in Apuglia, and
then after great thanckes, & corteſe offres of both partes
Scanderbeg retorned into Albania ſafely, whē the Albaneſes
vnderſtode of the comminge of their lorde, with ſo
great triumphe and victorie, the chiefe of them went to
doe reuerence vnto him, and to viſyte his highnes, with
great preſentes & giftes of victual, as fatt Calues yonge
Oxen, Kiddes, Lames, Wethers, Feiſants, Partridges
Quailes, Tortelles, Thruſſhes, Woodcokes, Snypes,
Pluuers, Henes, Pigiones, Capones, Hares, Conniesred
Deare, Valoe, Deare, Boares, Gyſe, and other
beaſtes, and foules, bothe greate, and ſmale, wylde and
tame with all kynde of other victualles, and with fyſhe
notwithſtandinge, his courte was alwaye very well furniſhed
of victualles (beſydes theſe preſentes) for he had
in his courte that lyued by his meate, and drincke. 5300.
perſones, and his cuſtume was to gyue meate & drincke
to all his ſubiectes, that came aboute anye ſutes thither
he entertayned very honorably all ſuche as came to viſyte
him, his chiefe coūcellers ſate alwaies at his owne
table: euery man in his degree, often tymes he wolde
cauſe them to drincke oute of his owne cuppe: a thynge
in that countre of great eſtimation, as when a ſouldiour
hath put him ſelfe in greate peryll for the ſafetie of hys
prince in token of the great fauour that he bare him: he
wolde ſome tyme drincke to him, & cauſe him to drincke
oute of his owne cuppe.
               After this Scanderbeg went to his confynes to viſite
his Captaine that he had lefte there? Whē he went
into Apuglia, and there he made great banckettes to
his Captaine and all his ſouldiours and gaue to diuerſe
of his fryndes, and thiefe ſouldiours great gyftes, to
ſome he gaue apparell of clothe of golde, to others ſylke
to ſome ſcarlate & other colours, to ſome he gaue horſes
to others money, to ſome one thinge, and to others an
other, acordinge to euery mannes deſeruinges, ſo that

euery man was very well pleaſed, beſyde this he neuer
denyed almes, to anye pore man that aſked him for Chriſtes
ſake, and in thoſe dayes he gaue great almes, and
chiefely to the ſonnes of thoſe noble men that had byn
chaſed oute of their countres by the Turckes, and to dyuerſe
noble ſtraungers that came to him from farre, to
whom he gaue not onely money and apparell, but alſo
poſſeſſiones to maintaine them honeſtly, to lyue lyke
Chriſtianes in the feare of god. When the Turcke vnderſtode
that Scāderbeg was retorned ſafely with ſuch
triumphe, and honor it greuyd him muche as it is well
knowen, for Mahomethe dyd neuer vnderſtande that
Scanderbeg had ben in Apuglia in perſon, but thought
that he had ſent onely that Captaine Coico with. 500.
horſes to the kynge aforeſayde for yf the Turcke had
vnderſtode that Scanderbeg had gone in perſon, he had
(notwithſtandinge the trewſe) emploied all his force to
deſtroie, ſpoyle, and conquere all his countre.
               When the trewſe was ended the Turcke gaue commaundemēt
to his Captaine that he ſhoulde in no wiſe
enuade Scanderbeg, onles that he began with him, and
in this meane tyme he went with his armie againſt the
Diſpoto of Morea, a man of great eſtimation, he chaſed
hym oute of hys countre,Morea taken by the Turcke. and conquered it, in the
yere. 1460.
               After this he went againſt the Emperour of Trebiſonda,
he toke and conquered all his ſtate. After this he
went againſt the Iſle of Meteline and immediatly toke
it, after this he marched againſt the Duke Stephano
Hierceco, and toke from him all his countrey, ſauing ye
Caſtell of Noui, which ſtandeth vpon the mouthe of Cataro,
and at this preſent is poſſeſſid by the Turcks. The
ſame Tiran toke alſo manye other places that dyd appertaine
to the Chriſtians, by meanes wherof he was
becomme muche more puiſſante then before, when the
Turcke ſawe him ſelfe in this ſorte victoriouſe, and triumphante,
by meanes of the greate enlarginge of hys
ſtate, he determyned to make warres vpon Scanderbeg
wherfore he appointed to Sinan his Baſſa aforeſayde
23. thouſande Turckes horſemen, gyuinge him cōmaundement

to goe vpon the ſudden and to aſſayle Scanderbeg,
wherof as ſone as Scanderbeg was aduertiſed,Synan Baſſa ſent agaīſt Scan. and defiected. he
ſent for fyue thouſand ſouldiours moe, horſemen & fotemen,
to the. 3. thouſand which he had alredie with him, &
then departed, with great ſylence in the nighte, & laide
his people vpon the waye that the Turcke muſt paſſe, &
toke an hill which is not farre from a place celled Mocre
ouer the which hill, the Turckes muſt in any wiſe paſſe
when the Turcks were come to the fote of that hil, they
began to goe vp towarde the heighte therof, not thinckinge
anye thing at all of Scanderbeg, and immediatly
he cauſed to ſounde the a larme, & with ſuche force charged
thoſe ſcatered Turckes (in ſuche ſorte) that he put
them to flyghte in ſuche diſorder, that none of them turned
for his felowe. But Scanderbeg continued ſtil the
chaſe, vntyll y• he had flayne the greateſt partie of them
beſyde thoſe that he toke priſoners. After this he diſtributed
al the proie to his ſouldiours, who throughe their
contynuall exerciſe in battayle,Note what exerciſe doth were becomme inuincible
ſo that they were of exceding noble myndes, al feare
was baniſhed oute of their heddes, they coulde endure al
kynde of trauayle and miſerie, this was the onely cauſe
whye Scanderbeg obtained ſo many victories, I ſaye ye
ſeconde cauſe, for the fyrſt was the grace of god. The
nexte day folowing Scanderbeg made a great courſe in
to the Turckes countre, and toke an excedinge greate
proye, and retorned into hys countre ſafely with al his.
               After this the Turcke ſent an other Captaine of his
called Aſſābeg, with an excedinge great armie into Albania,
and ſoughte a battayle with Scanderbeg, & with
in ſhorte ſpace all the chiefe conductours of hys armye
were ſlayne,Aſſambeg defeicted. whervpon the Turckes fled and the greateſt
number of them were ſlayne, & the Baſſa was hurte
in the righte arme with an arowe, and for that it was
late he with drewe him ſelfe with certaine with him, in
to a ſecrete place. But Scanderbeg being aduertiſed her
of, went the nexte morning to the place where he was,
and then Aſſambeg came forthe to him withoute anye
weapon, and vſed ſo good wordes towarde him that he
merited pardon.
               
                  
After this the Baſſa Iuſſubeg toke in hand to encoū
                  tre
Scanderbeg, with an armie of .18. thouſand Turckes,
and came neare a place called Scopia: notwithſtanding,
he had not ſo euel happe as the infortunate Aſſambeg
had,Iuſſubeg defeicted. for Scanderbeg paſſed on and mette him vpon
the waye as he was comminge, and charged him vpon y•
ſudden and put him, and his people to flyghte. Yet notwithſtandinge,
the vaine deſyre of fame and glorye, ſtirred
vp the olde Carazabeg which had ben a companion
with Scanderbeg, in the warres of Natolia, and other
places, who had done the Turcke great ſeruice, wherfore
he went to the Turcke, and ſo perſwaded with him
that in the ende he obtained licenſe to choſe as manye
ſouldiours as he wolde, to take with him, whervpon he
choſe. 30. thouſand horſemen, and made him redie, to goe
to ſeeke Scanderbeg, and to aſſayle him vpon the ſuddē
but Scanderbeg beinge aduertiſed hereof, went againſt
him paſſinge thorowe the two countres of Dibra vntyl
he came to the confynes of Triballe, where it was certified
vnto him,Carazabeg experimented in warres. that Carazabeg muſt paſſe, as ſone as
he came there he was ware of. 4. thouſande Turckes,
which Carazabeg had ſent before to diſcouer his paſſage
but comminge into the boſome of Scanderbegs armie,
the greateſt number of them were immediatly ſlayne
which when the Baſſa vnderſtode, he was excedingely
ſory, and chiefely for that he was ſo diſcouered: more then
for the deathe of his ſouldiours.
               Then this ſubtill olde Ruter ſent to Scanderbeg a
meſſager, requiring him to fyght with him like a prince
in appointed battayle, and not vpon ſuddennes in ſuche
ſorte lyke a ſtradarolle and thefe, ſeking alwaye to take
the enemye vnprouided. But Scanderbeg beinge as circumſpecte
as he, and knowing well the decepte of ye olde
man, who wolde ſeme to blame that in an other man, yt
he him ſelfe wolde fayneſt haue broughte to paſſe, yf yt
by anye meanes he moughte, Scanderbeg ſent him aunſwere,
ſaying,Celeritie doth much preuayle in warres. I wyll aunſwere the olde foliſhe followe
well ynoughe. Then whiles Carazabeg dyd conſulte of
the matter acording to the maner of olde men, Scanderbeg
with his armie in very good order, came and aſſailed

the armie of Carazabeg with ſuche force, and noyſe, y•
it was not poſſyble for one of them to heare an other, &
by meanes of the great rayne, and winde that then was
Scanderbeg coulde not folowe the chaſe acordingely as
he was wonte to doe, althoughe he handelled them very
rudely. But Carazabeg beinge greatly aſhamed and
confounded, toke the ſhorteſt waye to Conſtantinople,
where he was not a litle rebuked of the great Turcke,
and alſo mocked, after that by meanes of his fryndes,
he was well commended of that Tiran, for that he had
paſſed the iorney wyth leſſe charges, and ſpoyle of hys
people, then anye of the reſte of his Baſcias had done, &
brought away his people with leſſe ſlaughter.
               When Mahomethe ſawe that he coulde by no meanes
obtaine his purpoſe againſt Scanderbeg, he then determyned
to proue whether he mighte deceaue him or
no, wherfore he determyned to ſende to him for peace,
to the ende that he might procede againſt other princes
in the meane tyme withoute lett of Scanderbeg, wherfore
he ſent an ambaſſadour to him, with a letter, and
great preſentes,A letter frō the Turke to Scan. beſyde the clothe of golde, and ſylke, y•
he ſent him, who receaued the ambaſſadour with his letter
in very corteſe ſorte. The tenour of his letter was.
The lorde Mahomethe the mightie kinge, and Emperour,
of all partes of the worlde, from the Eaſte to the
weſt, to the noble prince Scanderbeg greating: we gyue
thy worthynes to vnderſtande, that notwithſtandinge
the great offences that thou haſt cōmitted againſt oure
houſe and ſtate, yet when I call to mynde, and conſider
the great trauayles and paynes and the worthy and excellente
actes, that thou haſt ſo faithfully wroughte, for
the conſeruation, encreaſe, and honor, of oure ſtate, whē
thou were oftage with oure father Amorathe and dideſt
eate his breade in Andrinople, and were more fauored,
and honored in his courte, then any other Sangiacho,
Baſſa (or good ſeruante) that he had. I can not but forget
all the aforeſayde offences, wherfore I gyue the to
vnderſtande that I haue determyned to pardon the all
offences, and to becomme thy frynde, and to make a perfecte
peace with the, vpon this condition, that y• wylte

ſuffer, that my people may paſſe ſafely thorowe thy coū
                  tre,
to make warres vpon the Venetianes, my enemies
and in conſideration herof. I wyll franckly gyue the all
that that thou poſſeſſyſt in Albania, which of righte did
appertaine to my father, and from henceforthe I wyll
call the prince of the Epirotes, and wyll doe the all the
pleaſure and honor poſſyble, I wyll alſo that for performance
of this peace, thou ſend me Iohn thy ſonne, whō
I wyll vſe as thoughe he were myne owne ſonne, and
moreouer, for that that I doe deſyre to ſe the perſonally
for the great fryndſhyppe that hath ben of a longe tyme
betwene vs, maye it pleaſe the to comme and viſyte me
that we maye reioyſe togyther, and god doth wel know
the great entertainement that I wyll make y•, I wolde
alſo that thou woldeſt graunte that the marchauntes
of myne Empire moughte ſafely paſſe thorowe thy coū
                  tre,
and I wyll graunte the lyke to the marchauntes of

Muſtaffa the bringer herof, and whatſoeuer
he ſhall ſaye vnto thee, I wyll performe, from Conſtantinople
the ſecond of May. 1461.
               When Scanderbeg had redde this letter he ſmyled,
and then talked a great tyme with the ambaſſadour, &
by him wrote aunſwere to the Turckes letter, in this
ſorte. The ſouldiour of Ieſus Chriſt, George Caſtrioth
ſometime named Scanderbeg,Aunſwere to the Turckes letter. prince of the Albaneſes, &
Epirotts, to the moſte excellent prince of the Turckes
Mahomethe ſendeth greating. By thyne ambaſſadour,
and letter. I haue vnderſtode the mynde of thyne excellentie
in certaine pointes, whervnto I aunſwere, firſte
that the Venetianes, beſyde all other fryndſhippes that
are betwene them and me, by the which we doe eſtime
here oure ſtates as one, are ſo honeſt good Chriſtianes,
and doe ſo well obſerue their promiſes, that althoughe
there were none other hande of oure Catholique faithe,
vnder paine of greatter excomminycation, that Chriſtianes
ſhoulde not wyllingly permitte the hethenes to
anoye Chriſtianes, I for the aforeſayde vertues, & goodnes
that is in them, maye neuer condiſcend to this firſte
demaunde, for ſo muche as I am not retorned to ye Chriſtian

faithe to ſtande a curſed, nor hurte ſuch as be faithfull.
As touching that, that thy highnes ſaieth yu wylte
from henceforth call me prince of the Epirotts, that ſhal
not offend me at all for thou ſhalte doe but right to giue
me that tytle, which God of his goodnes hathe gyuen
me, for his owne honor. And where thy highnes requireth
my onely ſonne Iohn, which is the ſolaſe of his mother,
this thinge alſo I maye not graunte: hauinge noyſſue
but onelye him, for I am carefull of him, and can
not otherwiſe aūſwere thee, and as to that thy maieſrie
ſaieth thou deſyreſt to ſeme perſonally, for ye great frindſhippe
that hath ben betwyne vs of longe tyme, I ſay alſo
that yf it were a thinge that moughte be done wythoute
peryll I wolde ſone doe it, but nowe for ſo much as
God hath appointed me to be abſent from thee in thys
ſorte, I doe thincke, that as it doth ſuffiſe me, ſo it ſhulde
ſuffice thee to ſe and beholde me with the eyes of thy
mynde. And to thys laſte where thou ſayeſt that thou
woldeſt that the marchauntes of oure countres ſhoulde
ſafely traffique the one, into the others coūtre thorowe
oute in all places, I am contented to make peace wt thee
with this laſte condition, and offer my ſelfe (in all iuſte
and reaſonable cauſe) to be at thy commaundement, and
thus fare well. And what I wante in writing thy ambaſſadour
ſhall certifie the by mouthe, from oure campe
the. 30. of Maye. 1461.
               When Scanderbeg had endyd his letter, the ambaſſadour
departed, and caried the letter to the Turcke, &
after that by commaundement of the Turcke wythin
40. dayes, he retorned to Scanderbeg with an other letter:
of this tenour.An other letter to Scan. from the Turcke. The lorde Mahomethe, the mightye
prince, and Emperour of all parts of the worlde, from ye
Eaſt, to the weſt, to the magnificent prince Scanderbeg
prince of the Epirotts, ſendeth greting. By Muſtaffa
my ſeruante & ambaſſadour, & by thy letter reſponſyue
I doe vnderſtand in what ſorte thou arte cōtent to make
peace with me, and alſo howe thou doeſt excuſe thy ſelfe
as touchinge certaine of my demaundes, wherefore to
ſhowe howe muche I doe fauour the, and howe greatly
I doe tender thy ſtate, I am content to make a perfecte

peace with the, acording to thyne owne wyll, and as I
haue alredie of myne owne goodwyll called the prince of
Epirro, ſo wyll I alwaye from henceforthe call thee, &
of my liberalitie I doe franckly gyue the, all the ſtate y•
thou at this daye doeſt poſſeſſe, as well that whiche appertaineth
to me in the righte of my father, as the reſte.
And credite Muſtaffa my ſeruante and ambaſſadour, for
whatſoeuer he ſhall promiſe in my behalfe, I wyll performe,
and agreing with him, thou ſhalte confyrme the
peace, which thou ſhalte ſigne with thyne owne hand, &
ſeale with thy ſeale, and ſend me, farewell, from Conſtantinople
the. 22. of Iune. 1461.
               When the peace was in this ſorte concluded, and publiſhed
in all places, betwyne Scanderbeg and ye Turcke
the Senate of Veniſe, by common conſent of the Senataurs
in the tyme of Chriſtofero Mauro, beinge then
their Duke, ſent into Albania a newe lieutenante, a mā
of great vnderſtanding, named Gabriel Deuiſano, to ye
ende that he ſhoulde be muche in the companie of Scanderbeg,
and to proue with his perſwaſiones, yf that he
coulde cauſe him to breake the peace that he had made wt
the Turcke, who made cruell warres vpon the Venetianes,
notwithſtanding Scanderbeg remained conſtant
and firme, for ſondrie reſpectes, and chiefely for that he
ſawe his people glad, and deſyrous of peace, conſidering
the longe warres that they had endured.
               When a certayne tyme wss paſſed, the aforeſayde
lieutenante of the Venetianes, went to the Arche Byſſhope
of Durazzo, which was in great eſtimation not onlye
in all that prouince, but alſo in Rome, and dyuerſe
other partes of Italie, and dyd righte well deſerue it, for
he was of a very good nature, lerned in the Greke, and
latyne, eloquent, well ſeen both in Diuinitie and humanitie,
beloued of al men, and honored chiefely of the princes
of Albania, and eſpecially of Scanderbeg, who repoſed
him wholly vpon him, his name was Paulo Angelo,
he was ſonne to the aforeſayde Andre, Captaine of Driuaſte,
of the excellencie of whoſe houſe I meane not to
ſpeake any furdre, for that it is manifeſtly knowē. This
lieutenante declared the mynde of the Senate to the aforeſayde

moſt reuerende Arche Byſhope, whoſe houſe
beinge of auncient frindſhippe with the ſtate of Veniſe,
and beſides that for other ſondrie good reſpectes (as ſone
as he vnderſtode of this) he went forthe with to Scanderbeg,
where thorowe the credite, auctoritie, and affiance
that Scanderbeg had in him, he ſo perſwaded, that
calling together dyuerſe other noble me, and ſouldiours
of great vnderſtanding, they concluded with the Arche
Byſhope, who aleged the infidelitie of the Turckes, and
howe that they neuer kepte their promiſe, but to ſerue
them ſelues with all, and with ſuch like arguments, he
broughte to paſſe, that he ioyned Scanderbeg, and ye Venetianes
in ſuche an amitie and fryndſhyppe, as euer after
contynued betwyne them. And for thys there was
made great ioye in euery place.
               After this the Turcke promiſed to gyue an hundred
thouſande ducates to who ſo euer coulde fley the Arche
Byſhoppe, and. 2. hūdred thouſand to whoſoeuer wolde
preſent him vnto him lyuing. Then Scanderbeg vpon
the ſudden gathered togyther his armie, and made a rode
into ye Turcks coūtrey and rayſed a proie of. S. hundred
thouſande ſhepe. 60. thouſande hed of Kyen, Oxen, and
Bullockes, and. 3. thouſande Mares, wyth their coltes,
whiche were of the Tnrckes owne race,Scan. taketh an exceding great proie oute of the Turckes domynions. he toke beſyde
this great riches, and burned a great pece of ye countre,
and retorned home ſafe, and diſperſed all the proie to his
ſouldiours.
               When the great Turcke vnderſtande of theſe great
ſpoyles that Scanderbeg had made, and howe he had
broken the peace with him, he was excedingly wrothe,
and daye, nor nighte thoughte of anye thinge but howe
to be reuenged of Scanderbeg, and of the Arche Byſhope
yet for that he vnderſtode that the pope Pio the. 2. wolde
in anye wyſe make a greate Croyſade, and goe againſt
him in perſon, he determyned to attempte yf he coulde
by anye meanes pacifye Scanderbeg, and to confyrme ye
peace that was alredie made, for he doubted that yf that
Scanderbeg ſhoulde comme with the Croiſade, that he
ſhoulde then be vtteriy ouerthorowen: as the Turckes
them ſelues declared in all places. This kynde of Croiſade

was determyned in the conciſtorie at Rome, by the
aforeſayde pope, beinge moued throughe the ſuggeſtion
of dyuerſe prelates, and Cardinalles, men of great worthynes,
and chiefely by the fryndes of the afore named
Arche Byſhope Pauolo, ſo that this moſt worthy pope
Pio the ſecond, had determyned to goe in perſon and to
ſee this iorney: and when he ſhoulde haue ben in the Citie
of Durazzo, to haue celebrate in the Cathedrale churche
therof a moſt ſolempne meſſe, and to haue gyuen to
this moſt worthye Arche Byſhoppe the hatte of a Cardinale,
for that he was alredie pronounced in the conciſtorie
at Rome, in the moneth before, and alſo to gyue ye
Regale corone to Scanderbeg, and to make hym kynge
of Epirro, and of all the whole Albania, and when he
had ſo coronned him, to gyue him trōchion, appointing
him general of the Croiſade, and in that ſorte to procede
to the vtter diſtruction of the Mahometane ſecte.
               When the Turcke therfore vnderſtode this, he ſent
the afore named Muſtaffa his ambaſſadour to Scanderbeg
with a letter of this effecte. The great and mightie
prince Mahomethe, Emperour of all partes of ye worlde
from the Eaſt,A letter from the Turcke to Scā. to the Weſt, to thee magnificent Scanderbeg,
prince of the Epirotts, I haue none occaſion to
ſende thee greting, nor to wyſhe the helthe as well for
that thou haſt broken the peace made betwyne vs, as alſo
in that thou haſt not holden thy promiſed faythe, but
haſt done me ſo manye manifeſt wronges: notwithſtanding,
for ſo muche as I vnderſtande that the Venetians
myne enemyes haue deceaued thee, and cauſed the ſo to
doe, for this I wyll haue ſomme reſpecte towarde the, &
haue ye partly for excuſed, & ſo to pardone the theſe offences,
ſo that thou wylte be cōtentyd nowe, to make peace
with me, which is to confyrme the tenour, and conditiones
of the laſt peace made betwyne vs, and that thou
ſhalte ſwere this ſeconde peace ſo confyrmed vpon the
faythe which thou oweſt to thy God,The eſtimation of an othe, with the Turcke. for ſo muche as I
am thorowly perſwaded, that yf thou haddeſt ſworne y•
fyrſte, that the Venetianes, nor any others coulde haue
cauſed thee to breake it: wherfore I beſeche thee, if that
my requeſt maye haue anye place with the: that thou

wylte make this ſecond peace with an othe, and I ſwere
vnto thee vpon my fayth, that I wyll obſerue my promes
in euery condition, and neuer to moleſt thee, but to
be alwaies profytable, and frindely to thee, and redie to
honor the, and otherwiſe I doe aſſure thee, that I wyll
leue all other enterpriſe, and wyll contynually folowe,
and plague thee in ſuche ſorte, that yf thou eſcape with
thy lyfe, I wyl baniſhe the thy countrey, and then it ſhal
be ſeen whyther the Venetianes be able to maintaine ye
againſt me or no, thou beinge a ſymple, & meane prince
of that parte of Albania whiche thou nowe poſeſſiſt, and
I am Emperour, kynge, and prince, of ſo manye powers
and countreys, that thou ſhalte neuer be able to wtſtand
my furye wherfore haue regarde to thy ſelfe, and make
this peace with good will, to the ende that thou mayeſt
dye lorde of thy countrey, and leaue that honor to thy poſteritie:
otherwyſe, it ſhalbe to thy hindrance: thou maiſt
gyue credite to my ſeruante and abaſſadour Muſtaffa, in
all thinges that he ſhall ſaye vnto thee, from Conſtantinople
the. 7. of Maye. 1463.
               After that Scanderbeg had herde the ambaſſadour,
and red the letter which the Turcke had ſent him, he
wrote him aunſwere in this ſorte. The ſouldiour of Ieſus
Chriſt,Aunſwere to the Turckes letter. George Caſtrioth ſome tyme named Scāderbeg
prince of the Albaneſes, to the excellent Mahometh
prince of the Turckes, gretinge, forſomuche as I vnder
ſtande by thyne ambaſſadour Muſtaffa, and by thy letter
alſo, the great complaintes and iniuries, wherwith thou
chargeſt me, I am enforced to aunſwere: and to ſaye vnto
the, that I doe not repent me at al in that that I haue
in this ſorte brokē the peace with thee, for it is not lawfull
for the great prince to make his wyll a lawe, and to
diſdaigne the leſſer, as thou haſt done me, in that, that
on a tyme a peace beinge made betwyne vs, thou immediatly
brakeſt it, with thy faythe alſo, and that this is
true, God is my witneſſe, and the worlde alſo knoweth
it, that whyleſt I dwelled in peace aſſuring my ſelfe vpon
thy promes, thy ſouldiours dyd greatly endomage me
whervpon I ſent my meſſager to thee, to whome thou
gaueſt aunſwere, that thou woldeſt chaſtize them that

had ſo offended, notwithſtanding thy promptneſſe was
torned into aire, and I remayned fruſtrate, and the offenders
withoute pūniſhment, which doth playnly declare
it to be done by thy conſent, wherfore knowe thou, that
I had great reaſon to redreſſe my wronges: and not to
make ſcrupule in breaking of peace with him, which eſtymeth
not peace, but dothe immagine howe to abuſe ye
worlde, and then wyll ſaye that the Venetianes haue
deceaued me, who alwayes obſerue their promes, not as
thou doeſt. And therfore I gyue the fully to vnderſtande
that in no caſe I wyll make peace with thee, thoughe I
be as ſymple a prince as pleaſythe God, & thou ſo mighty
and puiſſante an Emperour as thou ſayeſt, euen from
the Orient, to the ye Occident, which no man ſaieth but
onely thou, which throughe thyne audatitie, pride, and
preſumption, doeſt arogantly take vpon the to vſurpe
ſuche an Imperiall name, which onely appertaineth to
the Emperour of Rome, which is coroned by the pope of
Rome, beinge goddes vicar on earthe and thou by the
permiſſion of God arte becomme a mightie tyran to puniſhe
the wickedneſſe of the Chriſtianes, for the whiche
thou thinckeſt it lawfull to vſurpe ſo excellent a name,
wherby thou makeſt them laughe y• rede it, forſomuche
as the worlde is deuided into thre principal partes, that
is Aſia, Affrica, and Europa, the fyrſte is in maner as
great as bothe the other, and is deuided into Aſia ye greater
and the leſſer, in the leſſer whiche is called Natolia,
are many kingdomes, wherof thou poſſeſſeſt onely that
parte, whiche I by myne induſtrie haue broughte into
ſubiection of thy houſe, which is a ſmale portion in compariſon
of the reſt. In the greater, there are very manie
kingdomes in the which thou haſt nothinge to doe. In
Affrica there are excedinge manye kyngdomes, and prouinces,
wherof thou poſſeſſyſt no iote, but in Europe
which is almoſt the greateſt inhabitation of the worlde
there are manye kingdomes, and prouinces, of whiche ye
poſſeſſeſt onely, Tracia, Gretia, Seruia, Boſſina, More
a, Bulgaria, Achaia, Magneſia, Mitelline, and certaine
others which were, and ſhalbe of the poſſeſſiones of the
Chriſtianes, wherefore I doe not a litle maruell that y•
                  
whiche canſt gyue me good councell, canſt ſo ſuffer thy
ſelfe to be blynded with ambition, that thou doeſte not
conſyder what thou ſayeſt: and althoughe that for oure
ſcourge thou arte becomme a great tyran, poſſeſſing in
Aſia, & Europa, moe then thyrtie prouinces: yet I gyue
the to vnderſtande that I eſteme the not for all that, but
doe truſte in my lorde Ieſus Chriſt that he wyll cauſe a
thouſand hethennes to fall downe before the face of ten
Chriſtianes: ſo that I am not to be diſwaded nether for
flatterie, nor threatning, onles that thou wyll openly
embrace the Chriſtian faith wherin of a childe thou ha
                     •
                  
ben inſtructed, and alſo that thou wylte cauſe al thy ſubiectes
to be baptized, and doinge acording to that parte
of the Alchorane which ſaieth that the Goſpell is good,
and is the beſt thing that is vpon the earth, and in this
ſorte thou maieſt haue of me what thou wylte. Otherwiſe,
vnderſtande that I wyll defende my ſelfe, and that
not withoute thy hurte and ſhame, for I fyghte for the
honor of him, that wyll helpe me, from oure campe the
xxv. of Iune. 1463.
               As ſone as Scanderbeg had ſealed this letter,Note this 
                        •
                     cte. he went
to horſe with al his armie, and caried with him the aforeſayde
ambaſſadour, and went into the Turckes coūtrey
and raiſed a great proie, and aſſayled Sfetigarde which
of righte ſhoulde haue ben his, and toke the towne and
ſet fire on it: notwithſtandinge the citadell which ſtode
on the heighte of the hyl was in expungnable, wherfore
be retorned, and toke his leaue of the ambaſſadour very
cortezely, declaring to him by mouthe beſyde his letter,
wylling him to ſaye vnto the Turcke from him, that at
the comming of the great preeſt of Rome, with the Croiſade,
he wolde comme to ſatiffie his deſyre, that he had
ſo greatly to ſee him: and when the ambaſſadour had taken
his leue, he rode on of his iorney. Then Scanderbeg
retorned with his armie into his countrey, and diſtributed
the proie vnto them, and then gathered them together
and ſayde. My felowes in armes, I beſeche you be
of good chere, for yf the Croiſade be but as many in nū
                  ber
as the iiii. parte of the Turckes power, we wt theyr
helpe wyll chaſe him vndoubtedly oute of his domynyons

notwithſtanding I hope that the Croiſade wylbe of
farre greater power then his armie ſhall be, and ſo much
the ſonner, for that that God is with vs, and the ſouldiours
are Italianes, Frenſhemen, Spaniardes, Engliſhmen,
Almaignes. Hūgarianes, Pollonianes, Vallaques
Schiauoneſes, Greekes, Albaneſes, beſydes oure people
and others, by whoſe meanes, and by the grace of God. I
hope that the Turcke ſhalbe vtterly ruynate, and chaſed
oute of his dominiones, and his tyranny cleane plucked
vp by the rotes, and the churche of God to be at reſt, yf
it be the pleaſure of God.
               In this meane time ye ambaſſadour Muſtaffa brought
Scanderbegs letter to the great Turcke, who when he
vnderſtode the tenour therof was fylled with great furie,
not withoute excedinge great feare whervpō he ſent
forthewith to all his townes of force and fortes,great iud

                     the. that he
thoughte were of moſt importance, and fortifyed then
by all meanes poſſyble: & then called to him Seremeth
beg his Baſſa, and ſent him with xiiii. thouſande Turckes
againſt Scanderbeg, to lye vpon the confines of his
countrey for the garde therof and of his Citie that he 
                     〈◊〉
                  
muche eſtymed, called Orchride, or els Aeleria, which is
not farre from Scanderbegs countrey, and is neare vnto
a certaine lake oute of the which ye ryuer Drino doth
ryſe, in y• which lake their is great abondance of carpes
Trowtes, & other delicate & noble fyſhes. When Scanderbeg
vnderſtode of the comming of thoſe Turckes, he
determyned to ſeke them althoughe it were a harde matter
to deale with them, for ſo much as the one parte of
them were lodged within the Citie, and the reſt wtoute
not farre from it, in this meane tyme their came newes
vnto them howe that the pope Pio ye ſeconde was cōme
in perſon with the Croiſade to the Citie of Ancona, meaning
as ſone as the Duke of Veniſe ſhoulde comme thy
ther, to take ſhyppe, and to ſayle towardes the Turcks
notwithſtandinge he fell ſyke there, and in ſhorte ſpace
dyed,The pope poiſoned. beinge poyſoned acordinge to the opinion of many
by certaine hipocrites and falſe Chriſtianes throughe y•
which, the noble Duke of Veniſe which was then there
not onely with his owne armata, but alſo with the aide

of dyuerſe Chriſtian princes was excedingly amaſed, &
retorned to Veniſe much diſcomforted: and in this ſorte
was the great Croiſade fruſtrate.
               When Scanderbeg contrarie to his expectation vnderſtode
of this, he was ſtricken with very great ſorowe
forſomuche as in that was his onely hope. Then wyth
teares he lifted vp his eyes to the heauens, ſayinge O
moſt mercifull lorde Ieſu Chriſte very God, I doe ſee ye
thyne omnipotent,A prayer made by Scan. and diuine maieſtie (fountaine and
ſpringe of all goodnes) wyll not ſend forthe this Croiſade,
to the diſtruction of bothe thine, and oure enemies.
And I feare it is for oure offences which are Chriſtians
for that we haue greatly prouoked thee to wrathe, wherfore
I humbly beſeche the for thy mercyes ſake, by the
which thou pardonedſt the theſe hanging on the Croſſe
thou which arte onely comme to call ſynners to repentance,
that it maye pleaſe thee to defende vs thy ſeruantes,
which doe fyghte daye and nighte, in the defence of
oure moſte Catholique faythe: to the ende that the enemyes
ſaye not, where is the God of Chryſtyanes becomme,
notwythſtandynge thy wyll be done, and
not oures.
               When Scanderbeg had thus ended his praier, he t
                     •
                  
                  ned
him to his ſouldiours who wt teares alſo had praied
with him, and to comforte them he ſaid. My deare frinds
feare nothinge, but be of good chere, for God doth neuer
leaue thoſe that put their whole truſte in him, and doth
all thinges for the commoditie of both bodie and ſoule
of his faithfull, wherfore we humbly render thanckes
vnto his diuine maiſtie, and to morowe we wyll goe to
ſeke the Turckes oure enemyes, with whome we wyll
fyghte, and deale with them acordinge to oure wonte.
Thre houres before the breake of day, Scanderbeg rode
with xii. thouſande horſe men and fote men, and came
neare vnto the Citie of Orchrida aforeſayde, and ſpake
to his ſouldiours in this ſorte. This daye is the vigile of
the aſſumption of the virgine Marie Quene of heuen,Great blindnes. in
honor of whom and for the obedience of the commaundement
of holly churche, euery faythfull Chryſtian dothe
faſt, or at the leaſte doth eate fyſhe, but I doe vſe alway

to faſt, and for that confidence, and faithe, that I haue in
her. I wyll aſſuredly promiſe you, that at dyner tyme
you ſhall haue to dyne with, as great abondance of good
fyſhe, as euer you ſawe, wherfore conſider, that the cuſtumer
of this towne is a man of greate welthe, ſtronge
luſtie, and valiante, and he wylbe the fyrſte that ſhall
comme againſt vs: wherfore ſee that you giue him place
and in no wyſe ſtryke him, nor doe him anye hurte, but
take him, for after oure victorie (the which I hope we
ſhall obtaine, throughe the grace of Marie the Quene of
heuen) we ſhall haue plentie of ducates of the ſame cuſtumer,
and alſo as muche fiſhe, as ſhall ſuffiſe you wherfore
be of good chere.
               When he had thus ſayde he called vnto him Peiche
Emanuell and Pietro Agenlo brother to the Arche-Buſhope
Paulo, and appointed to their conducte v. hundred
choſen horſemen, and gaue them commiſſion to goe
neare the towne of Aeleria to prouoke the Turckes to
comme for the, and as ſone as they ſhoulde come neare
vnto them, he willed them to flee and to ſeme to be greatly
affraied, & to drawe them on to the place where Scanderbeg
moughte cut betwene them and the towne, and
ſo to aſſayle them in two ſondrie places at once, wherby
he moughte eaſyly defeicte them, as it came to paſſe, for
that the aforeſaide Captaines were men of great Iudgment,Great iudgment of Scan.
and trayned the enemyes ſpedyly paſte the place
where Scanderbeglaye in ambuſhe, and as ſone as they
torned vpon them and charged, they toke this cuſtumer
and immediatly vpō their charge, Scāderbeg diſcouered
him ſelfe, and charged them on their backes and ſlewe
x. thouſande of them, and toke the ſonne of Seremethbeg
with xii. Turckes moe of acompte, which were preſented
vnto him fearing leſte they ſhoulde be all flayne:The defeicte before A
                        •
                     laia.
but Scanderbeg, beinge curteſie it ſelfe, cauſed them to
be gentylly entreated, and of his great curteſie, layd the
greateſt charge vpō ye cuſtumer, who althoughe he were
very ſoroweful, yet with a pleaſant contenaunce he ſent
for ſo muche fyſhe, bothe freſhe, and ſalte, as dyd fully
ſatiffye the whole armie, wherfore they ſayde thorowe
oute the armie, that Scanderbeg was an Apoſtle of him

that fedde the multitude of y• Iewes with v. barley loues
and two fyſhes. After this for the ranſomes of the cuſtumer,
the ſonne of the Baſcia, and the other xii. Turekes,
there was preſented vnto Scanderbeg, the ſūme of
xl. thouſande ducates, in Golde, and money of the Turekyſhe
Coyne, then Scanderbeg cauſed it all to be layde
downe vpon carpettes and diſtributed al with his owne
handes to his ſouldiours, gyuinge euery man his offering,
but not as the preſte dothe vpon the ſolempne feaſtes.
After this he ſuffered the priſoners to departe into
the towne, and he retorned into his countrey ſafe and
with great ioye.
               When the Turcke vnderſtode this he diſpatched an
other fearce Captaine of his called Balaban Badera:
called Aga, with xv. thouſande Turckes on horſe, and
three thouſande fotemen, the which Balaban came to y•
Citie of Ocrida, or Aelcria, and ſent ſecretly to Scanderbeg
dyuerſe great preſentes, to purchaſe frindſhyppe wt 
him, to the ende that paraduenture he beinge taken priſoner
at anye tyme, moughte be aſſured of his lyfe, as
it was declared to Scanderbeg by the ſecret arie of Balaban,
which was taken by Scanderbegs ſouldiours in a
rencountre betwyne the Turckes and him, this Balaban
was an Albaneſe borne, and a coūtre man, ſubiecte
to the father of Scanderbeg, and was taken in his child
hed by the Turckes, with dyuerſe other children, as they
were keping of Cattell, notwithſtandinge, hys happe
was to ſerue men of acompte, and ſo became a valiante
man, and for that he was the fyrſt that entred into Conſtantinople,
when the Turckes gaue the aſſaulte vnto
it, the great Turcke exalted him to y• degree. When he
was in this ſorte appointed againſt Scanderbeg, he ſemyd
outewardely to be muche his frynde, althoughe inwardly
he was the greateſt enemye that he had in all y•
worlde, as by the profe it was ſeen, for he was euer attentyue
to take in hand all ſuche enterpriſes as mought
tende to the diſtruction of Scanderbeg, vnder the pretence
of diſſemblyd fryndſhippe, to the ende he moughte
doe the more hurte. And when Balaban vnderſtode, that
Scanderbeg with his ſouldiours was in the valley called

Valcal, he made him redie with xv. thouſ̄d horſemē
and three thouſande fotemen, to goe in the nighte to aſſayle
Scanderbeg: but he beynge aduertyſed hereof by
his ſpiall, went to encountre him, wherof Balaban beinge
certyfyed and beinge a ſhamed for ſondrie reſpects
(and chiefely for that his treaſon was ſo diſcouered, and
alſo his fained frindſhyppe) he retorned with ſpede. Thē
Scanderbeg came ouer the valley aforeſayde, and encamped
vpon the heighte of the ſame with all his people
which were in number 4. thouſande horſemen wel moū
                  ted,
and v. hundred fotemen, to whom he ſpake in thys
ſorte. My companions, I doubte not but to morowe: or
the nexte daye at the fardeſt,Scan. to his ſouldiours. this moſte wicked traitour
Balaban wyll comme to ſeeke vs with all his power,
wherfore I thincke it good that we tarie him, and when
we ſe him comminge that we departe from hence, and
goe to that litle hill that is behinde vs, to the ende that
they maye thincke that we flee from them, conſydering
oure number is ſmalle in the reſpecte of them, and therfore
maie the more boldly and aſſuredly chaſe vs, and
then, when I ſhal gyue you a token, euery man to make
hedde, and to charge them beinge ſo ſcatered, by meanes
wherof, we maye eaſyly ouerthrowe them, whiche yf it
ſo happen (as my truſte is in God that it ſhall) I commaunde
you all vpon payne of my diſpleaſure,Note the Iudgmēt of Scan. that you
folowe the chaſe euen to the mounte, or hill of Valcal
and no furder, for I am aſſured that they wyll leue ſome
troupe in that valley, to the ende that yf they ſhoulde be
broken, and we ſhoulde folowe them paſte that place,
they moughte charge vs behinde, and they whome we
ſhoulde folowe ſhoulde charge vs in the face, and all in
an inſtante, and by that meanes ouerthrowe vs at their
pleaſure, for the place is very apte for an ambuſhe.
               The ſeconde daye after that Scanderbeg had thus
exhorted his ſouldiours, Balaban with all his power
came to fynde Scanderbeg, who acordinge to his, determynation
went with his ſouldiours towarde the aforeſayde
hill: then the Turckes with greate furie aſſayled
Scanderbeg, and he fled for a certaine ſpace, and then
in an inſtante torned and charged them (he beinge in

very good order) with ſuche force that after longe, and
terrible fyghte, he enforced them to torne their backs, &
to flee in great diſorder, in ſuche ſorte that in the ende y•
greateſt number of them were founde ded vpon y• feelde
and the victorie was folowed to the aforeſayde appointed
place.Balaban defeicted the fyrſt tyme. But the aforeſayde Moyſes, Gintrizza, Muſachio
Dela Angelina, Gino Muſachio, Giouaniperlato,
Nicolo Beriſio, Georgio Cucca, and Gino Maneſio, euery
one of theſe were able to gyue order to an armie, &
had often tymes gouerned righte great charge. Theſe
men being very erneſt in executinge the enemie, by meanes
of the great hatred they had towarde Balaban and
his Turckes,Nota. dyd not remembre, or els in their furie eſtemed
not the commaundement of Scanderbeg, wherfore
they paſſed the appointed place folowing y• victorie
fleynge, and cuttinge in peces, their fleing enemyes, vntyll
that they came to the myddeſt of the valley of Valcal.
Then the ſquadrone of the enemyes (acording to the
ſaying of Scanderbeg) that there was layde, charged
wholly vpon theſe eighte Captaines, which after longe
and cruell fyght in the defence of them ſelues wyth the
great ſlaughter of thoſe amaſed Turckes, paſſed of force
thorowe the myddeſte of that valley, and clymed vp an
hill vpon the heighte wherof were the Turckiſhe fotemen,
vnknowen to them, wherby they were deceaued,
thinckinge that they had ben of their owne men, they
were taken by theſe fotemen, and delyuered to Balaban
who forthewith ſent them to y• great Turcke, who then
was at Conſtantinople. When Scanderbeg vnderſtode
this piteouſe caſe, he ſent immediatly and ambaſſadour
to the great Turcke, to deſyre him that he wolde be contentyd
to reſtore to him thoſe priſoners ſafe, and in exchaunge
of them he ſhoulde haue others, or els, as much
money as they dyd weighe, but he beinge full of furie, &
crueltie, and being aduertyſed by Balaban of their worthynes,
wolde in no wyſe gratifye Scanderbeg, but in
greater diſpite cauſed them to be flayed by lytle,Barbarique crueltie. and litle,
for the ſpace of xv. daies contynually, and in thys
ſorte they dyed.
               After this the Turcke ſupplied his armie, and commaunded

Balaban in any wiſe to contynue the warres
againſt Scanderbeg, notwithſtanding Balaban durſte
not to make anye attempte againſt him, but ſoughte to
qualifie the matter, and to be at peace with Scanderbeg
who neuer put any truſte in him, nor yet graunted him
peace for anye gyfte that he coulde ſend, but contynually
made his courſes into the Turcks countre, & brought
from thence great proyes, and ſpoyles, and euer retorned
to his confynes, when Balaban ſawe that he coulde
by no ſecrete practiſe pacyfy Scanderbeg, he determyned
to proue yf that he moughte by treaſon ſurpriſe him
and ſo vpon the ſudden to defeicte him for he was oute of
all hope to ouerthrowe him in battayle, wherfore he diſcourſed
in him ſelfe by what meanes (in executinge hys
intent) he mought defeicte Scanderbeg, with his armie
alſo and in the ende he founde meanes by gyuing an exceding
great ſūme of money to corrupte his garde that
he helde contynually withoute his campe, to gyue aduertizement
from tyme, to tyme of the comming of the enemye.
In this companie were certaine Albaneſes hys
kynſmen, in whom Scanderbeg had great affiance, not
thincking it a poſſibilitie, for anye ſuche treaſon to haue
had place in them, Balaban toke his iorney in the night
with xv. thouſande horſemen, and .3. thouſand fotemen
to aſſayle Scanderbeg, and marched vntyll it was with
in an houre of daye, and then approchinge neare to the
campe, Scanderbeg by meanes of the greate noyſes of
their horſes ſuſpected the treaſon of the aforeſayd garde
and made him redie moſt ſpedyly, with his iiii. thouſand
horſemen and one thouſand fiue hundred fotemen, euen
as thoughe he had ben aduertized of the whole practize,
ſo that his enemyes thincking to take him vtterly vnprouided,
founde him in very perfyte, and good order, at the
which the enemies were excedingely aſtonied notwithſtanding,
throughe the great encoragementes of Balaban,
they encounteryd with Scanderbeg, and charged
him in terrible ſorte with greate furie, but in the ende
throughe the prouidence,Balaban defeicted the ſeco
                        •
                     
                     tyme. and conducte of Scanderbeg,
they were all diſordered, and put to flyghte, in ſuch ſorte
that fewe of them caried anye newes home but of the armie

of Scanderbeg there were onely ten flayne.
               When the great Turcke had aduertyſement of this
he determyned in anye wiſe to procede againſt Scanderbeg,
and knowing Balaban to be of no leſſe valiantize,
and experience in warres, then the beſt of the reſte
of his Captaines: and alſo y• he was an Albaneſe borne
and a great enemye to Scanderbeg, he ſent him agayne
with xviii. thouſande horſemen, and iii. thouſande fotemen,
with whō he arriued at the Citie of Aelcria, where
he contynued for a longe tyme withoute gyuing any at
tempte againſt Scāderbeg, and dyd contynue his ſecrete
ſendinge of preſentes vnto hym, and declared vnto hym
that he was his very frynde, and ſeruante at commaundement.
But Scanderbeg who dyd well knowe him to
be a great murtherer, and Traytour, and that it was
his onely ſute to be ſent againe with charge againſt him
dyd not onely, not truſte him, but alſo to declare, that he
made none acompte of him, and beſyde that, that he had
receaued his preſentes, ſent him in change ſomptuoſe
preſents growing aboute the villages wherein Balaban
was borne, which was ſacks of a litle yelowe graine
and alſo of cocle, and ſuch like of vile price, wt a ploughe
harrowe, pycke axe, ſpade, van, and flayle, with ſuch like
inſtrumentes,
               Then Balaban well vnderſtanding his meaning by
this, was marueloufly offendyd: and knowing that Scā
                  derbeg
laye contynually vpon his confynes with viii.
thouſande horſemen, and ii. thouſand fyue hundred fotemen,
he marched with his whole armie againſt Scanderbeg,
and when he ſawe Balaban comming he made
him redie, put his people in order and marched towarde
him and ioyned with him in battayle, the fyghte beyng
terryble, Scanderbeg with his owne hand ſlewe y• daye
many of his enemies, and as he was in the preaſe fyghting
with his enemies (throughe ille fortune) his horſe
was ſlayne vnder him, and fell downe to the grounde wt 
him, and in the fall Scanderbeg lighted vpon y• troūcke
of a tree that was cut downe, and by meanes of y• great
fall, he was greatly bruſed, and chiefly in his right arme
in ſuche ſorte that he coulde not in maner ſtirre it at al.

Then the Turckes thincking that he had ben ded, cauſed
certaine to diſcend from their horſes to ſtryke of hys
head, whervpon he called vnto him his wonted magnanimitie
and notwithſtanding his exceding great bruſe
he lepte vp and ſtode vpon his fete, and with his ſworde
flewe all the Turckes that were ſo lyghted from theyr
horſes, and as many moe of others that enuironed him
to y• intent to haue ſlayne him, his actes that he then did
were maruelouſe. At the laſte, one of his ſouldiours
brought vnto him one of his beſt courſers and whē Scā
                  derbeg
was mounted on horſe, he gaue in amonge the
Turckes in ſuch furie, as in his lyfe he had not done the
lyke, and alwaye one ſtroke was the price of one enemy
with him, and he aſſayled the enemies with ſo great aſſurance,
and force, that he conſtrained them to diſorder,
to torne their backes,Balaban defeicted the thirde tyme, and to flee, & in the chaſe he flewe
them in maner all, but the ſayde Balaban with a very
ſmale nūber with him, dyd flee into y• Citie of Orchrida
aforeſayde.
               After this, Scā. diſpoſed y• whole ſpoile to his ſouldiours
very liberally, according to his cuſtume but after y•
victorie, he endured ſuch paine in his arme, y• he was iii
monethes & coulde not ones lifte it, to take of his cappe
to gratifie ſuche as dyd ſalute him,Great abſurditie ne yet to reuerence y•
Image of oure Sauiour, nor of the virgyne Marye, ne
yet of the ſaincts. And alſo when he herde maſſe he was
ſerued as is the highe Byſhoppe when he dothe aſſyſt in
ſolempne feaſtes, for he coulde not helpe him ſelfe at all
with one of his hands.
               In this meane whyle Balaban beinge very ſorowfull
and aſſhamed, retorned with fewe with him to Conſtantinople,
and was greatly blamed reuyled, and condempned,
by the great Turcke, but he lyke an olde Ape
and ſubtyll foxe, endured all thinge patiently, and whē
the furie was paſt he founde ſuche meanes that he ſo excuſed
him ſelfe, attributing his ouerthrowe to the prouidence
of God, that the Turcke was well ſatiſfyed wt his
excuſes and cōmitted the whole charge of theſe warres
to his diſcreſion: wherevpon forthewyth he toke in hys
companye the Captaine Iaguppe Arnanthe a man of

great value, Iagup Arnanthe ſignifieth in oure ſpeche
Iamez the Albaneſes. When he was marching, he deuided
his armie, and wylled Iames with one parte therof
to paſſe throughe Tracia, and Macedonia into Epirro
and in anye wyſe to kepe him ſecrete, and not to enuade
vntyll he had aduertiſement that Balaban was arriued
in Albania, and he that fyrſt approched the confynes to
tarie his companion, to the ende that they moughte vpon
the ſudden aſſayle Scanderbeg.
               Balaban on the other ſide toke with him xx. M Turckiſhe
horſemen, and iiii. thouſande fotemen, and came
firſt into Epirro, and encamped in the afore named place
of Valcal, which when Scanderbeg vnderſtode being alwayes
prouided, and in redines, ſent iii. ſpiones into the
enemies campe to conſider the order of the ſame but one
of theſe ſpiones was a kinſman of Balaban, and was y•
cauſe that the other two retorned not at the houre appointed,
whervpon Scanderbeg being a ſouldiour moſt
vigillant, toke with him fyue ſouldiours and went to
diſcouer the campe of the enemies, but that ſubtyl Balaban
who had good experience of the vſage of Scanderbeg,
appointed to that place which was moſte apte for
ſuche purpoſe, certaine ſouldiours on horſe, and beynge
there, encountred with Scanderbeg, and were at the
blowe of the ſworde for a tyme. But in the ende Scanderbeg
was enforced to flee and take the neareſt way to
his campe and paſſyng thorowe a ſtraite founde by miſhappe,
a tree lying ouerthwarte his waye, notwithſtandinge,
he put ſpurres to his horſe and lepte ouer it and
ſo dyd one of his ſouldiours: but the other foure coulde
not by anye meanes, whervpon they turned to y• Turckes,
and charged them, and ſlewe certaine of them, but
in the ende they were all foure ſlayne. In this meane
tyme Scanderbeg beinge moued with pitie torned hym
and eſpyeing a Turcke that had lopte the tree after him
folowing him, he encountred him with ſuche furie that
at the firſte ſtroke he ſlewe hym, and then he fled vntyll
he came to Pietra Biancha, which was viii. myles from
him: where be founde his viii. thouſand horſemen, and
iiii. thouſand fotemen tarying for him.
               
                  
Then he chaunged his horſe, and in fewe wordes encoraged
his ſouldiours to fyghte ſtoutly, and when he
had thus done, he marched on towarde the enemie, and
or that he wolde encountre him, he toke a certaine hyll
not farre from them, and then ordeyned all thinges for
the battayle, & preſented his people in foure ſquadrones
the one he committed to the conducte of Thamſſio Thopia,
lorde of the countre neare vnto Durazzo and coſyn
to the Arche Byſhoppe Paulo Angelo aforeſayde, the ſeconde
he committed to the leading of Zacharia Groppa
the thirde to Peiche Emanuell and the fourthe he lad in
perſon and this was his order, but Balaban who taried
for his companion wolde in no wiſe accepte the battaile
wherof when Scanderbeg vnderſtode, he diſbanded certaine
men and entred the ſcaramoche with the Turcks
augmenting it from tyme to tyme,Note this order. in ſuch ſorte, that he
in the ende enforced them to comme to the battayle, and
then preſented all his ſquadrones in fronte ſauing onely
one which he helde hidden behinde the reſte, the battayles
beinge ioyned the fyghte was terrible, in this
meane tyme the fourthe ſquadrone came in vpon their
flancke vnſoked for, and charged them with ſuch corage
that the Turckes not beinge able to endure the force of
the Albaneſes, acording to their olde cuſtume diſordered
them ſelues and fledde, ſo that they were hurte, & flayne
in maner all,Balaban defeicted the fourth tyme. notwythſtandinge Balaban wyth fewe
wyth him conueyd him ſelfe in to a place of ſecuritie.
               This victorie beinge newely obtained, their came a
meſſager in great haſt to Scanderbeg from his ſyſter ye
ladie Mānizza, declaring vnto him yt Iagup was comme
into Albania by the waye of Belgrado, and had proied,
ſpoyled, and burned a greate pece of his countrey, when
Scanderbeg vnderſtode of this, he immagined forthewt
the determynation of the two Captaines to haue ben togather
him in the myddeſt betwyne them bothe, he inſtructed
his armie, and encoraged them greatly, not to
doute xvi. thouſand Turcks, conſydering that they had
in ſhorte ſpace before, ouerthrowen xxiiii. M. whervpon
he marched towarde the leſſer Tirana where Iagup wt 
his armye laye, Scanderbeg as ſone as he drewe ſomething

neare his enemye ſtaied and choſe fyue hundred
horſemen to goe and prouoke the enemye to the feelde.
As ſone as Iagup ſawe this, he ranged his armie in threſquadrones,
and with certaine diſbanded horſemen charged
them, and put them to flyghte folowing the chaſe wt 
thoſe diſbanded horſemen, marchinge after them with
his whole power, and when they came where Scanderbeg
was he cried vnto them to turne, whervpon immediatly
they charged the Turckes, & Scanderbeg with his
armie in order came on and ioyned with them,Nota. and in
ſhorte tyme put them to flyghte, by meanes that he ſawe
where Iagup was in perſon, whervpon he choſe vnto
him certaine aſſured ſouldiours & ſeuered them ſelues
and charged the ſquadrone wherin Iagup was,Iaguppe ſlayne & his armie defeicted. and ſo
of force entred it and with his launce ſmote him vnder
the chyn thorowe the throte and flewe him, wherewith
the Turckes being amaſed and diſcoraged ſtode lyke vnto
ſhepe withoute a ſhepherde: and were flayne miſerably,
and mayne of them were taken priſoners, ſo, that
acomptinge fyrſte thoſe of Balaban, and ſecondaryly
theſe of the Baſſa Iagup, there were xxiiii. M. ſlayne, beſydes
vi. thouſande that they herde no newes of at all.
After this Scanderbeg cauſed to gather togyther al the
golde, ſyluer, and other riches, which the Turckes had
gotten in his countrey and caried al into Croia in great
triumphe making greate feaſtes to the contentacion of
al that there were, and he ſent meſſagers to ſondrie princes
and others his fryndes that dwelled neare aboute
him, with the newes of this great victorie, & ſent them
alſo preſentes of the Turckyſhe ſpoyle, as horſes, courſiers,
ſlaues, Armour furniture of horſes, riche garmēts
of men, and ſuche lyke.
               When the greate Turcke vnderſtode the dolorouſe
defeicte of theſe two armies, he determyned to goe in
perſon with all his power againſt Scanderbeg but he
hauing intelligence hereof, made prouiſion for y• defence
of his countre, and eſpecially furniſhed Croia with men
and all kynde of neceſſaries, his ſouldiours on fote were
of the garniſons of the Senate of Veniſe, their gouernour
was a worthy man named Baldiſera Perduci. In

thoſe daies there was in that part of Albania which was
ſubiecte to the Seigniorie of Veniſe, their Proueditour
a Venetian borne, named Ioſaphat Barbaro, a man of
great worthynes, who by commaundement of the Senate,
dyd often tymes attende vpon Scanderbeg, and
the Arche Byſhope Paulo, who for the great zeale that
he had towarde the Chriſtian religiō, was in thoſe daies
contynually with Scanderbeg, onles that he were ſent
in his name or in the name of the Seigniorie of Veniſe
in ambaſſade to anye Potentate for the preſeruation of
there countres, as ofte times he went to Rome, Milane
Naples, Venis, and other places.
               In this meane tyme there came from Conſtantinople
to Scanderbeg two Turckes, ſaying that they were
comme thyther to becomme Chriſtianes, and to ſerue
him faithefully, and alſo to ſaue their ſoules, being aſſured
that the faithe in Ieſus Chriſt, was the onely true
and holſom faithe, and in the contrarie, the faithe Mahometane
to be falſe, vniuſte, and dampnable, as was euidently
ſeen, by the great thinges that god dyd dayely
worcke by one onely man, which in comparaiſon of the
Turcke was a very lambe, and yet dyd contynually triumphe
ouer a moſt fearce and cruell Lyon. Then Scanderbeg
receaued them courteſly and gaue them large prouiſion
for their maintenance, cauſing them to be inſtructed
in the Chriſtian religion, euen as they had ben of his
owne nation: notwithſtanding, this comming of thers
was to a deueliſhe ende, which by y• goodnes of god was
diſcouered, who neuer faileth ſuch as vnfaynedly truſte
in him, for on a tyme theſe two Turckes fell at wordes
and in fine ſtrake together with their fiſtes in ſorte that
they loſte muche bloude from oute of their noſes, and the
one ſaying to the other in great furie, yu traitour dogge
ſent by the great Turcke to ſley the moſt gentle & good
prince Scanderbeg, when the Captaines of Scanderbeg
vnderſtode this, they toke theſe two forthwith, and
preſented them to Scanderbeg, who cauſed them immediatly
to be tormented and then they cōfeſſed the whole
matter in euery pointe, and ſhewed the dagguers which
they caried ſecretly aboute them for y• purpoſe, declaring

alſo howe that y• Turcke had promiſed them an infinite
ſumme of money, and alſo to make them great lordes, yf
that they coulde ſley Scan. he then beinge a prince of
great magnanimitie and one that dyd honor y• Turcke
wolde not for his ſake vſe them acording to their deſertes,
but cauſed them to be broughte oute of his Padiglion,
& ſo apparelled as they were, cauſed them to be hanged
vpon the heighte of two greate trees, where they
moughte be well diſcerned from all partes of the feeldes
aboute it, when he had thus done he toke his horſe, and
with all thoſe ſouldiours that then were with him and
in all the countrey neare vnto him, entred into y• parte
of the Turckes countrey where he neuer was before, &
when he had ſpoyled all the countre, he then rayſed fire
and burned all the countre where he paſſed thorowe,
and retorned home ſafe wyth all hys people in to hys
countrey.
               After this the aforenamed Mahomethe, came into
Albania with two hundred thouſande men on horſe and
fote, and encamped before the Citie of Croia, promiſing
them of the towne great gyftes, yf that they wolde render
the towne vnto him vpō compoſition, and otherwiſe
he threatned to put them all to the ſworde, but their aū
                  ſwere
was, with the faire Cāuonade, harquebuzade, and
ſuche lyke, in ſorte, that they ſlewe many of the Turckes,
and contynued the ſame daily, vntyll the Turckes
diſlodged from thence and abandoned the ſeege. Whiles
the Turcks laie before Croia, Scāderbeg was alwaies
attendante vpon their campe, nowe in one quarter, and
then in an other, deſtreſſing their foragers, & alſo their
victuallers comming to their campe, and often times in
the nighte aſſayled their campe, nowe in one quarter, &
then in an other ſo, y• he made great ſlaughter of them.
Then at the laſte the Turcke ſeinge Croia to be in expungnable,
and hauing receaued there bothe great loſſe
of his people, and alſo great diſhonor, he determyned to
leue before it a campe volant, and ſo in y• ende by famine
to take it, whervpon he lefte the aforeſayde Balaban to
execute that enterpriſe with xviii.M. choſen horſemen
and fyue thouſand fotemen of the beſt in all the armye,

with viii. Sangiacchi, men of great experience, & Iudgement
in warres, to the ende the better to aduiſe. This
done, the great Tiran departed from thence, retorning
towarde Conſtantinople, and in his iorney be toke certaine
fortes of Scanderbeg, and put his garniſons into
them, with officers to kepe them in his obedience, beſide
this, by meanes of a wicked Traitour he toke a place called
Chidua, wherin were viii. M. of Scanderbeg ſouldiours,
beſyde women and children, and others y• were
not able to vſe armes, to whom by meanes of this traitour
he made great promiſes, but beinge once within, he
brake his faithe, and cauſed them all to be cut in peces,
which was greatly to the hindrance of Scanderbeg, not
withſtanding, within ſhorte time he recouered al againe
and cut in peces as many Turcks as he founde in thoſe
places, which the Turcke had thus taken from him, the
Turcke retorned to Conſtantinople very ſorowfully &
Melancholyque for the great ſpoyle, and loſſe of his ſouldiours,
which he had ſuſtained in that iorney.
               Scanderbeg, conſydering the Turckes that beſegid
Croia were valiante and of great experience, and had ſo
fortyfied them ſelues that it was an impoſſybilitie to aſſaulte
them, for that they had alredie taken y• hil Crniuo
by meanes wherof, it was expedient to haue a great armie
to take in hand that enterpriſe to rayſe them from
that place, Scanderbeg hauing loſte the aforeſayd eight
thouſand men in Chidua, was enforced to demaūde aide
of other Chriſtian princes, whervpon he went to Rome
in perſon and declared his cauſe before the pope Pio the
ſeconde and his Cardinales and other prelates in their
Conciſtorie and was gently herde and great promiſes
were made vnto him, notwithſtanding (at his departure)
by meanes of euyll tonges, he receaued ſmale ſuccour
at the popes hande who was a Venetian borne, but
not ouer full of deuotion, and for that that Scanderbeg
was greatly eſtemed of ſondrie of them, it is no maruell
yf others dyd enuie him, by meanes wherof he obtained
no more for his trauayle then. 3000. Ducates onely, the
which Iunetrio beinge one of the chiefe Citizens of Driuaſto,
coſyn to the Arche Byſhope Paulo Angelo, and

Steward to Scanderbeg receaued, Scanderbeg was excedingly
troubled with this, notwithſtandinge he gaue
thanckes to God and retorned ſafely into his countrey.
Then he went firſt to Scutari where he founde Ioſafat
Barbaro aforeſayde, lieutenante to the Venetianes,
who leuied bandes of thoſe that were ſubiectes to the
Seigneours of Veniſe and ioyned them with his ſouldiours,
and prouided them of al kynde of neceſſaries, there
went with him alſo to ayde him, Leche Ducagino, with
his brother Nicholas, with foure hundred horſemen and
as many fotemen, choſen ſouldiours and of great experience
in warres, with an hundred men at armes alſo
well armed and mounted, he had alſo fyue hundred fotemen
of Italie, Venetianes borne of the garniſon of Scutarie
with a thouſand Launces and .3. thouſand fotemē
of the countres aboute Scutari, Driuaſto, Antiuaro, Aleſſia,
and Dirachio, which made an armie of .13. thouſand
and .4. hundred choſen men, with whom Scanderbeg
marched toward Croia, and when he came neare y•
towne, he ſpake in this ſorte. My lordes, and you my
good ſouldiours: althoughe oftē times good wordes doe
comforte weried and troubled myndes, yet I wyl at this
preſent as well encorage you by my dedes as by my wordes,
for that I doe knowe you to be of noble myndes, &
deſyrous to put oure enemie to the flighte, wherfore my
truſte is in god, that yf the Turckes whiche doe beſege
my Citie, were as manye moe in number as they are,
we ſhall vndoutedly ouerthrowe them and put them to
the ſworde.
               When he had thus ſayde, he deuided his armie into
two partes,Vaiuoda lyeu: enant to a prince in felde or towne. committing the one to Nicolo Moneta Vaiuoda
of Scutari, and ſent him ouer thorowe a playne &
certaine woodes to a certaine ſtronge place called Gionenemi,
not far from that place where the Turckes laie
in campe before Croia: he commaunded the aforeſayde
Nicolo not to departe from thence in anie wyſe vntyll
that he herde him ſhote of certaine Cannones, which he
dyd acording to his promes. In this meane tyme Scanderbeg
went with the reſte of his armye and vpon the
ſudden toke the heighte of the moūte Canino in diſpite

of the enemies, and determyned to councell with the aforeſayde
Nicolo, of what ſorte to procede, Balaban hauing
intelligence of the comming of Scanderbeg, went
forthwith to Croia, requiringe them to yelde the towne
vpon Conditiones, making them of the towne greate
promeſſes in the behalfe of his Maiſter, perſwading him
ſelfe, that hy theſe meanes he ſhoulde obtaine victorie,
acording to the intelligence that was gyuen him, whervpon
he had exhorted his armie to be of good chere, declaring
to them that yf they moughte haue the towne
delyuered vnto them, that then he wolde with his armie
lodge in the towne, and wolde not care for the comming
of Scanderbeg yf that he ſhoulde happen to comme, but
yf that it ſo chanſed y• they dyd not obtaine it, he wolde
leuye his campe and departe thence, whyles Balaban
loked for aunſwere there ſorted forthe of the towne certaine
ſouldiours to ſcarmoche with his people. Then he
beinge exceding wrothe, and oute of al hope of recouerie
of the towne, with his ſouldiours that were then with
him, gallopped towarde them to gyue a charge on them
but the Chriſtianes perceauing it, drewe neare y• towne
vnder the defence of the ſhotte,Balaban ſlaine before Croia with the ſhote of a Harquebuze. whervpon George Aleſy
an Albaneſe, diſcharged his harquebuze, and ſtrake Balaban
vnder the chin into the throte, and gaue him hys
deathes woonde, not withſtanding this great blowe Balaban
fel not but put ſpurres to his horſe and gallopte
to his tente when the Turckes vnderſtode of this, and
alſo that the mounte Crina was alredie taken, they abandoned
the ſeege, and beinge greatly affraied conueid
them ſelues ſpedylye in to the feelde named Tiranna.
               Then Scanderbeg fynding no man to reſyſte hym
went downe into Croia, and cauſed to bringe into the
towne all the meale, barly, and other victuales that were
lefte in the Turckes campe, whiche were ſufficient to
ſuſtaine them of the Towne for one whole yere, when
he had this done, he lodged in the Citie and ſent certaine
bandes to take the paſſages and ſtraites, thorowe the
which the Turckes muſt paſſe, for he determyned to
ſeke them and to gyue them battayle. That ſame very
euening came two Turckes of acompte to Scanderbeg

deſyring him, in the name of their whole armie to gyue
them their lyues, and that they wolde with one conſent
gyue him willingly all that they had and excuſed them
ſaying, that they were enforced to comme to that ſeege
by the commaundement of their prince, whoſe breade
they dyd eate, ſo that with great humiletie they deſyred
Scanderbeg to graunt them that, which he neuer denied
to their fathers, when Scanderbeg had herde y• requeſte
of the Turckes, he commaunded them with a fryndly
contenaunce to be well lodged in a faire pauillion, and
to be honorably entertayned. After this, the aforeſayde
Scanderbeg called to him the aforeſayde lieutenante wt 
the noble lordes Ducagini, and other lieutenantes, mē
of great vertue, vnto whom he declared the requeſt of y•
Turckyſhh armie, requiring their aduiſe and aunſwere
Ioſaphat Barbaro (which the Venetianes had ſent into
Albania to be contynually in company with Scanderbeg)
ſpake fyrſte and ſayde that he wolde doe nothinge
but what ſhoulde pleaſe Scanderbeg to commaūde him
wherfore he wolde doe as it ſhoulde ſeme good to Scanderbeg
in this matter. After this ſpake Leche Ducagino
very franckly ſaying, Embetha, which in oure tonge ſignifieth,
vpon them, for that he thoughte it not requiſite
to vſe mercy towardes infydels, but to cut them in peces
of the ſame opinion were dyuerſe other noble men, and
Captaines of great value. Then Scanderbrg ſpake vnto
them ſaying, you noble men, and you worthye Captaines,
I truſte in the lorde, and am well aſſured, that
yf we ſhall happen to encountie the Turckes, we ſhall
ſone defeicte them. Notwithſtanding, for that they are ye
choyſe of all the Turckyſhe armie, and nowe becomme
deſperate, and determined in dede to emploie their hands
and for that alſo that the ende of warres is doubtefull,
and that god for oure offences ſhoulde permitte them to
haue the victorie, as it maye well comme to paſſe. It
ſhoulde be the ruyne of vs all.Ripe iudgment. Wherfore to plaie ſuer
it ſemeth to me reaſonable that we reſpecte the attempte
vntyll ſuche tyme as Croia be ſupplied with victualles
and other neceſſaries for manye yeres: and then to goe
on to encountre them with aſſurance of mynde, and to

ouerthrowe them for ſo muche as they can eſcape in no
wyſe for that the paſſages are alredie taken. The opinion
of Scanderbeg was wel lyked of many, and of others
not lyked at all, and chiefely of ſuche as were ſubiectes
to the Venetianes, who deſyred erneſtly to be reuenged
of the Turckes, and of ſome others which had not experimented
the force of y• Turckes very often. Then Scanderbeg
called for the two Turckes aforeſayde, and wylled
them to declare vnto the whole armie, that as they
came not with his licenſe to beſege his Citie, no more
ſhulde they departe oute of his countre with his licenſe.
In this meane tyme be ſent his armie to y• Ryuer Iſimi
where he had a great number of ſhippes loded wt corne
meale, biſkete and other victuales, and cauſed all to be
vnloded with ſpede, ſo that in thre dayes he furniſhed
Croia for ſyre yeres. And then went with all ſpede to encountre
the Turcks, but he had taryed a longe, for they
in theſe thre dayes ſeinge them ſelues ſo aſſayled wyth
famyne, went to the paſſages, and paſſed of force, not wt 
oute greate ſlaughter and ſpoyle of their mē, and in this
ſorte fled. Then euery man in maner was ſory, and murmored
againſt Scanderbeg, and layd the whole faute of
their eſcape vpon him, but he with his great corteſye, &
gentle wordes pacifyed and contentyd them all, lainge
for his excuſe the olde prouerbe, that to the enemy that
fleeth a man muſt make a brydge of golde, and then gaue
to euery man preſents and gyftes, acording to his place.
In this meane tyme many Albaneſes of the Venetians
countre, and of the countres of other princes came & preſented
to Scanderbeg a great number of the heddes of
Turckes, with horſes, armour, and other ſpoyle, in the
ende Scanderbeg very honorably, licenſed his armie. Sauing
onely his two thouſande horſemen, and one thouſande
fotemen wyth whome he went forthewyth to his
confynes.
               When Mahomethe the Turckyſhe prince, vnderſtode
that Scanderbeg had rayſed the ſeege of Croia, wt 
ſo muche honor, to his great ſhame, and loſſe of his people,
he was muche gryued there with, wherevpon the
yere folowing he retorned into Albania wt two hundred

thouſande Turckes, and went to beſege Durazzo,Mahomethe agayne in Albania a noble
City and of great antiquitie, which had ben a garniſon
towne of the renomed Romaines, he did greatly moleſt
it notwithſtandinge he departed from thence withoute
it, with ſpoyle of his people and great diſhonor, frō
thence he went with ſpede to Cro
                     •
                  a, & beſeged it roūde,
and ſent his meſſager to ſignifie to them of the towne, y•
yf they wolde delyuer him the Citie, he wolde aduaunce
them, and deale liberally with them all, and otherwyſe
it ſhoulde be to their paine, for he was determyned not
to departe thence withoute it, and wolde be reuenged vp
on them to the vttermoſt. The aunſwere of the beſeged
was not farre to ſeeke, but was gyuen by the mouthe of
the Cannon, Colueryne, harquebuze, and ſuche like inſtrumentes.
Scanderbeg, on the other ſyde dyd often
tymes aſſayle the Turckyſhe armie, nowe in one quarter
and, then in an other, makinge great ſpoyle of
them, holding them in continuall feare and doubte, whē
the Turcke ſawe that he coulde by no meanes obtaine
the towne, he departed with all his armie thence, and
marched to a place called capodelli Rodane, neare vnto
the Admatique ſea where Scanderbeg had buylded a Citie
named Chinril, which was not fully fynyſhed nor
repleniſhed with inhabitanes, he toke it and raiſed it to
the very foundation, after this he paſſed thorowe the
countre of Scanderbeg, thincking to take it from him
but he coulde not take the ſympleſt forte that he had, he
went alſo into certaine mountaines of Albania, where
there were multitudes of Albaneſes, with their whole
familes and ſubſtances, and aſſayled them, but he was
repulſed with great diſhonor, ſpoile, and ſlaughter of his
people: but Scanderbeg who was euer vigillante, and
folowed the Turckyſhe armie daye and nighte, making
great ſpoyle of them, in ſuch ſorte that Mahomethe being
in maner oute of al hope was conſtrained to retorne
to Conſtantinople by the ſhorteſt waye.
               When the Turcke was comme to Conſtantinople
be apointed Alibeg and Aleſbeg his Captaines to haue
the conducte of xxviii. thouſande men, and ſent them to
his confynes with expreſſyd commaundement that in

no wyſe they ſhoulde goe to fyght with Scanderbeg, nor
to enter his countrey vnles that he firſte began, but onely
to garde well his confynes. Theſe Captaines came
to the frontiers and obeyd the commaundement of their
lorde, and ſecretly ſoughte to haue fryndſhippe wt Scanderbeg,
and ſent vnto him preſentes of greate price and
value, he alſo vſed them very corteſly and fryndly, not in
that that he feared them, but bycauſe he wolde not be
counted ingrate: for he neuer truſted them, but ſtode alwaye
vpon his garde. In the ende Scanderbeg vnderſtanding
certaynely, that theſe Captaines had expreſſed
commaundement from their lorde not to make anye attempte
againſt him, but onely to garde his confynes, &
alſo howe that they were deſyrous to be in peace with
him, he lefte the one parte of his ſouldiours vpon hys
confynes, and toke the reſt with him and went to viſyte
his countre, and to adminiſter Iuſtice and reaſon to ſuch
as had nede therof, and to ſe that none were oppreſſed.
After this, Scanderbeg came to Aleſſio aboute certaine
affares that touched bothe his ſtate, and the ſtate of the
Senate of Veniſe, and chiefely for order howe to take a
certaine newe Citie called Valma, whiche the Turcke
had builded and there fel ſicke of a feruant feuer, in ſuch
ſorte, as he was enforced to lye longe in that place, and
ſeing his deathe at hand, he called vnto him all his Captaines,
and had a longe diſcourſe with them, who ſhed
not a fewe teares to ſee him in that caſe, and in the ende
he called vnto him Iohn his onely ſonne, and in the preſence
of his mother the lady Doneca and of y• reſt, ſpake
vnto him in this ſorte.
               My good ſonne knowe thou, that I fynde my ſelfe ſo
euyll diſpoſed in my body, that I am aſſured y• the tyme
of my departure oute of this worlde is at hande, whiche
thinge ſeing it is by the prouidence of God, his wyll be
done: but for that thou arte very yonge, and not able to
defende oure ſtate: for that oure enemye is of excedinge
great power, I haue determined to leue it in the protection
of the Senate of Veniſe, as my deare brother, & good
father, Paulo Angelo the Arche Byſhope, oure hope
(whom I leaue in my ſtede of the gouernaunce therof)

hath often tymes perſwaded me. And further I doe commaunde
the my ſonne, that thou be alwaye aduiſed by
him, for in ſo doing thou ſhalte not doe a myſſe, conſydering
his great wiſedome and experience to be ſuche,
as I can not but hope well of the, and of the reſte of my
ſubiecttes, yf that you be gouerned by him, for I am aſſured
that for my ſake he wylbe as carefull for the and
thyne, as yf thou were his owne ſonne, wherfore when
thou haſt ſhutte vp theſe myne eyes and buryed me, goe
thou then into Apuglia to oure Caſtles and townes y•
we haue there, and contynue there vntyll thou comme
to age able to gouerne, and then goe to Veniſe, and be
alwayes aduiſed by the Senate therof, who wyll gladly
ſee the, and ſet the ſafely into thy ſtate and dominion, I
commend vnto the all my ſubiectes, whō I haue alwaye
founde faithefull and obedient, vſe them ſo, that they
maye rather loue the, then feare the, which thou maieſt
eaſyly doe, if thou ſe iuſtice truely admyniſtred.
               Scanderbeg had ſcarcely gyuen ful order for his teſtament,
when a meſſager from the gouernour of Scutari
came, with a letter ſignifiyng vnto him, howe that
Hamathbeg one of the Turckes Baſas, was comme frō
Seruia with x. M. horſemen, and v. M. fote
                     •
                  en, and had
paſſed a very ſharpe and difficulte mountaine named
Illugi, which dyd appertaine to the Venetianes, & was
comme downe into their countre, and had made greate
ſpoyle there. Then that noble and magnanime prince
Scanderbeg, beinge greatly moued with theſe newes
cauſed to make him redie, and appointe his ſouldiours
to make them redie to ryde: in this meane tyme his deſeaſe
dyd ſo encreaſe vpon hym, that it troubled him in
ſuche ſorte, that he was enforced to ſend his ſouldiours
awaye to Scutari and to tarie that daye in his lodging,
commaunding them to doe whatſoeuer the lieutenante
ſhoulde commaunde them, and that he wolde the nexte
daye be with them to deale with Hamathbeg and hys
power, when his ſouldiours vnderſtode this they rode on
their iorney ſheding of teares and came to Scutari, and
forthewith by commaundement of the lieutenante afore
ſayde paſſed on ouer the plaines vntyll they came to the

ryuer named Cli
                     •
                  o. Then a certaine of the Turckes
which were on the other ſyde of the riuer making garde
(as ſone as they ſawe them) knewe them to be of Scanderbegs
ſouldiours, and maruelling at their ſudden aryuale,
called vnto them aſking where Scanderbeg was,
it was aunſwered that he was in Aleſſio, and that the
morning folowing he wolde loke vpon them, where vpon
the Turckes repared to their Captaine Hamathbeg
who laye in campe vpon the territorie of Driuaſto, and
declared vnto him the newes that they had herde. Whē
Hamathbeg vnderſtode theſe newes, he was excedingly
affraied, ſo that he was enforced to ſtande al that night
in battayle, and in the morning very tymely to marche
awaie, and to paſſe ouer Mountaignes by very difficulte
paſſages and wayes, ſo y• it was the iorney of all y• daye
to attayne to the highte of that hill, and that ſame night
folowing there fell ſo muche ſnowe, dryuen with a vehement
wynde beinge in the monethe of Ianuarie, that y•
greateſt number of thoſe poore, and fearefull Turckes
died in that night, and they which were lefte on liue the
daye foloing, marched awaye in exceding great feare, &
loked often tymes behinde them yf that they mought ſe
Scanderbeg to folowe them, and had determined, yf they
had ſeen him comme, to fall vpon their knees, & to yelde
vnto him, as it was declared to the Driuaſtianes by ſondrie
Turckes which they toke, and in euery place where
theſe poore Turckes paſſed, they were cut in peces, and
ſpoyled, & miſerably handled, in ſorte, y• fewe of them euer
retorned to their dwelling place.
               This ſame very daye that the Turckes thus fledde
not beinge folowed by anye enemie,The death of the Chriſtian prince Scan. this moſt Chriſtian
prince Scanderbeg, lefte this earthly lyfe, yeldinge hys
ſoule to God in the yere of oure helthe. 1467. and in the
yere from his birthe. 63. he was buried in the Cathedral
Churche of Saincte Nicholas, in Aleſſio, with greate
ſolempnitie, and honor, for whoſe death the bewaylinge
was ſo vniuerſale, as the lyke was neuer ſeen in thoſe
partes of Epirro, for in all places a man ſhoulde haue
harde them wepe betterly, of all eſtates, and chiefely the
nobilitis, and Captaines, cryed oute in moſt piteouſe

wyſe, ſaying, O Scanderbeg oure good kinge, oure defendour,
oure onely comforte, oure father, and brother,
why haſt yu thus lefte vs Orphanes as ſhepe withoute
a paſtor, howe maye we nowe anye lengar eſcape the
handes of thoſe moſt cruell, and wycked Turckes, oure
enemyes, woe ſhalbe vnto oure pore people, woe to both
great and ſmale, woe to Albania, and to all the prouinces
therof, and to all the prouinces neare aboute it, In
lyke ſorte dyd the princes, and people of other countres
neare aboute it, morne, and lament, for Scāderbeg was
their eye, and watche man, the defendour of the ſtates
of all faitheful Chriſtianes, and of his owne, he was entirely
beloued of all Chriſtianes onles it were of y• falſe
Chriſtianes diſciples of Iudas. Alſo the vnreaſonable
creatures lamented his deathe, for one of his beſt horſes
vpon whō he had done great actes, and ben alſo in perillauſe
battayles, which was a very well doing horſe, and
of great trauayle, in battayle lyke a Lyon, of ſuch fearcenes
as it was marueled at of all the noble men and Captaines,
that had ſeen the doinges of the horſe, and oute
of battayle he was as gentle as a lambe, this horſe as
fone as his Maiſter was dead, began forthewith to braie
terribly, and to bete him ſelfe from the one ſyde, to the
other, wtoute taking anye reſt daye nor nighte, he wolde
neuer after that daye ſuffer bridle, nor ſadle to be put on
him, nor wolde neuer taſte anye kynde of hey prouender
or other ſuſtenance, but contynually braying & beating
him ſelfe daye and nyghte tyll at the laſt throughe very
fayntnes, he fell downe to the earthe, and neuer roſe agayne
vpon his fete but dyed, the ſignification hereof I
committe to the ſecrete purpoſe of God, who knowethe
all things, notwithſtanding I wyſhe all Chriſtians not
to ceaſe, but contynually to gyue thanckes vnto his diuine
Maieſtie for his great benefites beſtowed vpon vs,
and to praye him to delyuer vs from the cruell and wicked
handes of the Turckes, and to gyue vs victorie againſt
them, and all other infydels, as he alwayes dyd
to his faithefull ſouldiour Scanderbeg, which was not
vnlyke in victorie to Iudas Machabeus, Scanderbeg
was muche lyke to the Emperour Eracleo, which by the

helpe of God dyd ouerthrowe the proude hethen prynce
Coſdroe, Scanderbeg in all the afore named battayles,
and others wherof there is no mencion made in this treatyſe,
was neuer 
                     •
                  hurte nor maymed at anye tyme, excepte
once that he was hurte in the righte legge with
an arowe, but the poore ſouldiour which ſhotte it, was
forthe with eſpied of him and flayne at one onely ſtroke,
and cut in two peces, his armes were alwayes, couered
with armour, he was not enchaunted, as the folyſhe ignorante
people dyd affirme, for yf he had ben echaunted,
he coulde not haue ben hurte by the arrowe, and it is
writen y• he neuer fought but his arme was well armed
his vſe was euer to throwe of his braciall,Vſage of Scan. as ſone as he
had put his enemyes to flyghte, to the ende, y• he mighte
the more franckly ſtryke, for he beſtowed neuer more
then one blowe, vpon one enemye in chaſe, at all other
tymes he was very well armed, and dyd ioyne with his
rare force, wiſedome and experience, and wolde neuer at
tempte God.
               After that he was ded, the worthy Captaines peiche
Emanuell, Zacharia Groppa, Leche Cucca, Paolo Maneſi,
with dyuerſe other worthy men, and worthy of credite,
who had ben with him in maner in all his doinges
dyd affyrme howe that Scanderbeg in thoſe battayles
wherein they had accompanyed him, had ſlayne with
his owne hande moe then. 3. thouſand mē, his order was
ſuche that his enemye dyd neuer longe ſtande againſt
hym but ſpedyly he put them to flighte, and as touching
his naturall force, it was not muche vnlyke to y• moſte
rare force of Orlando, and Rynaldo, with other famous
Knyghtes of the myghtye kinge Charles, he gaue ones
a great blowe in the preſence of all his armie, beinge in
a greate furie for otherwyſe I belyue he ſhoulde hardly
haue done it, there were taken in battayle ii. ſouldiours
of Balabanes kynſemen, which were rebelles vnto Scā
                  derbeg,
theſe were preſented vnto him, and had done him
muche hurte, and diſpleaſure, he wolde not ſuffer y• anye
other ſhoulde ſley them, but drewe his ſworde, and with
one onely blowe he cut them both in peces, in ſuch ſorte
that they fell downe ded to the earthe, not withoute maruell

& trembling, of all thoſe y• behelde it. The Turcke
on a time vnderſtanding by reporte that Scāderbeg had
a ſworde: wherewith he wolde ſtryke of ſome tyme a
mannes arme beinge well armed, and wolde cut in peces
a helmette or anye other kynde of armour made of
yron, ſent vnto him deſyring him to gyue him y• ſworde
Scanderbeg had moe then thre of that temper and goodnes,
& ſent the Turcke franckly one of them, the Turcke
was very glade of ſuche a preſent and cauſed the ſworde
to be proued by certaine of his moſt valiante men, to ſe
yf that they coulde cut yron wt it, but they dyd not much
hurte the yron with it, no more dyd their ſtrokes the
ſworde. Then the Turcke ſent to Scanderbeg that his
ſworde was no ſuche ſworde as it was named to be, but
Scanderbeg aunſwered that the ſworde was ſufficiently
good to doe more then had ben reported of him, ſo that
it were gouerned by his arme, whiche he kepte to hys
owne vſe. And for teſtimonie of his force I thincke it not
inconuenient to recite certayne ſtrokes that he gaue for
pleaſure, to the ende, that ſuche as be of Iudgment may
thincke what he moughte doe, beinge well armed and
kyndled againſt his enemye, Scanderbeg hath ben ſeen
to chaſe the Beare, the wylde Goate, the Wolfe, the
Harte, the Bore, and ſuche lyke beaſtes of great ſpede:
ouer the playnes on horſebacke, and with one onelye
blowe to haue ſtryken anye of the afore named beaſtes
ridinge, to the grounde ded.
               And on a tyme it happened the kynge Ferrante to
hunte in Apuglia, beinge acompained with manye noble
men acording to the vſe of that countre, and when
anye beaſte came forthe of the woodes to the playne, the
kinge vſed to apointe ſome noble man to ſley it with his
ſharpe Gianetton, and it happened that a greate Bore
came forthe to the playne, the kinge ſmyling ſayed that
that chaſe belonged to his deare father Scāderbeg, who
then withoute ſaying anye more, or taking anye Gianeton
with him (which is a weapon appointed for that purpoſe)
put ſpurres to his horſe and galloped after y• boare
in the ſyghte of them all, hauinge no armour vpon him
and ouergate the boare, & drewe his ſworde and running

with one ſtroke cut him a ſonder in the myddeſt & put
vp his ſworde, and retorned agayne to his companye,
where at the kinge, and Quene, with all the nobylitye
maruelied muche, to ſee a man of a goodly ſtature, vpon
an highe Courſer runing, to doe ſuche a myracle. An other
tyme in a woode of the ladie Mamizza, his ſyſter, in
albania their was a wylde Bufallo a bull very great of
bodye, and he was much feared, he had done much hurte
to dyuerſe valiant men, hunters, and others that paſſed
that waye, and chiefely to ſuche as dyd were redde garmentes,
Scanderbeg dyd alwaye vſe to were on his hed
a ſcarlatte cappe, after the maner of Carmannola, and
on a tyme beinge in this woode at the chaſe, and ſeynge
this Bufallo comminge oute of the woode all they that
were wyth hym began to flee, where at he ſmyled and
thruſte his horſe towarde the Bufallo, and dealte with
him with ſuch agilitie that at one ſtroke he ſmote of hys
hed, wherat all men maruelled, and eſpecially his valiante
Captaines, which before fledde from the beaſte, but
in the ende, they dyd greately reioyſe at that ſtraunge
blowe, the ſworde that Scanderbeg ſtrake the beſte with
was a Scimitar bending lyke vnto a falchion he was a
righte damaſkyne, he vſed ſometyme to weare two in
one ſcaberde, and ſometyme to breake them both in one
battayle, or els ſo to ſpoyle them, y• he mought no more
with his honor were th
                     •
                  m. At the laſte there came an excellent
Maiſter oute of Italie, who made him thre Scimitaries,
not onely good, but excellent, wher of he gaue
one to the Turcke, they wolde cut all kynde of yron and
neuer hurte the edges of them, Scanderbeg dyd wt theſe
ſwordes great actes againſt y• enemies of the catholique
faythe, in the honor and ſeruice of the almightie God, it
was neuer ſeen that Scanderbeg fled from any man, on
les it were once from a ſouldiour of his owne on whom
he had compaſſyon. This ſouldiour on a tyme (as Scanderbeg
was debating with his Captaines of certaine ſeruices
of importance) aunſwered ſo vnaduiſedly, & with
ſuche inſolencie, that he moued him in ſuch ſorte that he
laide hand on his ſwerde and ran at him, but the ſouldiour
torned his horſe redyly and fled. Scāderbeg folowed

him vntyl that he came to a ryuer: then the ſouldiour torned
him and drewe his ſworde and ſpake vnto him very
aduyſedly, ſaying, that he coulde flee no further for the
ryuer.Great magnanimitie of Scan. wherfore he was enforced to defend his lyfe, whē
Scanderbeg vnderſtode this who wolde not haue loſte
ſuch a man for his weighte of ſyluer, he conſidered both
howe reuerently and manfully he behaued him ſelfe towarde
him, he was moued with compaſſyon, and ſayde
vnto him, be of good corage, doubte not, comme on with
me. I wyll not hurte the, and in this ſorte repreſſed his
furie, and retorned to the companie gyuing greate commendations
to this worthye man and plaſed hym in the
number of thoſe that he moſt fauored.
               When the Turcke vnderſtode the newes of ye death
of Scanderbeg, he wolde in no wyſe belyue it but ſayde
to his viſiri and chiefe Captaynes, that it was a fyneſſe
of his enemie, to fayne him to be ded, meaning therby to
doe ſome ſtraunge facte, wherfore he was in great feare
and ſtode more vpon hys garde then before, and wolde
not attempte any thinge at all againſt Scanderbeg nor
againſt any other neighbour of his vntil one whole yere
was paſte, but as ſone as that moſt cruell enemie of the
Chriſtianes was aſſured of the deathe of Scanderbeg, he
was more glad then euer he was before at anye tyme &
immediatly aſſembled his armie and ſent them not onely
into the countre of Scanderbegs, and of the Venetianes,
but alſo into the countres of all y• reſte of y• princes
of Albania, not once, but often tymes, as to the ſiege of
Croia, Scutari, Driuaſto, and ſondry other places, making
warres vpon them for the ſpace of .xi. yeres withoute
ceaſe, notwithſtanding throughe the helpe of God,
that countre dyd alwaye defend it ſelfe, not wtoute great
ſpoyle, and ſlaughter of the Turckes aforeſayde. In the
ende this mightye Tyran came into Albania in perſon
with all his power, and all the princes therof that fled
not, were other ſlayne, or lad awaye in miſerable captiuitie,
he toke in maner the whole countre of Albania in
a very ſhorte tyme, but the victorius Citie of Scutari
(not fearing his longe ſeege) dyd alwaye defend it ſelfe
not wtoute the ſlaughter and ſpoyle of an infinite nūber

of Turckes. In the ende y• Senate of Veniſe to conclude
a peace with the Turcke, were content to giue him that
Citie, ſauing the lyues and goodes of the Citizens acording
to the conditions of the peace that was made with
Tauth Baſſa of Romania by meanes of y• magnificient
Pietro Angelo, who was ſent with commiſſyon honorable
in ambaſſade, from the mightye Antonio Loredano,
generall of y• Venetian Armata, to the aforeſaid Tauth
with whom Ducagino was priſoner, by whoſe meanes
he obtayned a ſafe conducte, for the Senate to ſend an
ambaſſadour (for the concluſion of the aforeſayde peace)
to Conſtantinople. Then the Venetianes ſent their ſecretarie
Iohn Dario, ambaſſadour to y• great Turcke, &
concluded that peace.
               In this meane tyme all the inhabitantes of Scutarie
came to Veniſe, and were receaued by the Senators,
and rewarded largely for their faithefull and true
ſeruice. After this the Turckes toke the Citie of Aleſſio
where with all deligence they ſoughte for the bodye of
Scanderbeg, & as ſone as they had founde it, althoughe
in his lyfe tyme they feared it, and alſo hated his name,
yet being ded they worſhypped it: as we vſe to worſhipe
Canonizad ſainctes, and in the ende happie was he that
coulde gete ſome pece of his bones, eſteming it for a holly
relique, and ſet it in golde or ſyluer, and hanged it aboute
their neckes as thinges of great hollineſſe, ſaying
that therby thei hoped to haue alwai victorie, whiche is
a paganiſhe ſuperſtition. Althoughe that for the offences
of vs Chriſtians, which are ſo deuided amonge oure
ſelues by meanes of oure Ambition, and gredines, god
hath gyuen the Turckes manye greate victories a,
gainſt vs, euen to this preſent daye acording
to oure moſte iuſte deſertes and
merites.
