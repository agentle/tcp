               Thrust those reprochfull speeches downe his throat,
               That he hath breathd in my dishonour here.
            
            
               Chiron.
               For that I am prepard, and full resolude,
               Fowle spoken Coward, that thundrest with thy tongue,
               And with thy weapon nothing darst performe.

               Away I say.
               Now by the Gods that warlike Gothes adore,
               This pettie brabble will vndoo vs all:
               VVhy Lords, and thinke you not how dangerous
               It is to 
                     •
                  et vpon a Princes right?
               VVhat is Lauinia then become so loose,
               Or Bascianus so degenerate,
               That for her loue such quarrels may be brocht,
               VVithout controulement, iustice, or reuenge.
               
                  Young Lords beware, and should the Empresse know,
               This discords ground, the musicke would not please.
            
            
               Chiron.
               I care not I, knew shee and all the world,
               I loue Lauinia more than all the world.
            
            
               Demetrius.
               Yongling learne thou to make some meaner choise,
               
                  Lauinia is thine elder brothers hope.

               VVhy are ye mad? or know yee not in Rome,
               How furious and impatient they bee,
               And cannot brooke competitors in loue?
               I tell you Lords, you doo but plot your deaths,
               By this deuise.
            
            
               Chiron.
               
                  Aron, A thousand deaths would I propose,
               To atchiue her whom I loue.
            
            
               Aron.
               To atchiue her how?
            
            
               Demetrius.
               VVhy makes thou it so strange?
               Shee is a woman, therefore may be woode,
               Shee is a woman, therefore may be woonne,
               Shee is Lauinia, therefore must be loude.
               VVhat man, more water glideth by the mill

               Though Bascianus be the Emperours brother,
               Better than he haue worne Vulcans badge.

               Demetrius.
               Then why should he dispaire that knows to court it,
               VVith words, faire looks, and liberalitie.
               VVhat hast not thou full often stroke a Doe,
               And borne her cleanlie by the Keepers nose?

                  To square for this: would it offend you then
               That both should speede.
            
            
               Chiron.
               Faith not me.
            
            
               Demetrius.
               Nor me so I were one.

               You must perforce accomplish as you may:
               Take this of mee, Lucrece was not more chast
               Than this Lauinia, Bascianus loue.
               A speedier course this lingring languishment
               Must we pursue, and I haue found the path:
               My Lords a solemne hunting is in hand,
               There will the louelie Romane Ladies troope:
               The forrest walks are wide and spatious,
               And many vnfrequented plots there are,
               Fitted by kinde for rape and villanie:

               Come, come, our Empresse with her sacred wit
               To villanie and vengeance consecrate,
               VVill we acquaint withall what we intend,
               And shee shall file our engines with aduise,
               That will not suffer you to square your selues,
               But to your wishes hight aduaunce you both.
               The Emperours Court is like the house of fame,
               The Pallace full of tongues, of eies, and eares:
               The woods are ruthles, dreadfull, deafe, and dull:
               There speake, and strike braue boies, and take your turns,

               Sonnes let it be your charge, as it is ours,
               To attend the Emperours person carefullie:
               I haue beene troubled in my sleepe this night,
               But dawning day new comfort hath inspirde.

               He that had wit, would thinke that I had none,
               To burie so much gold vnder a tree,
               And neuer after to inherit it.
               Let him that thinks of me so abiectlie,

               The birds chaunt melodie on euerie bush,

               Replying shrillie to the well tun'd hornes,

               Seest thou this letter? take it vp I pray thee,
               And giue the king this fatall plotted scrowle.

               That this fell fault of my accursed sonnes,
               Accursed, if the faults be proud in them.

               Let them not speake a word the guilt is plaine,
               For by my soule, were there worse end than death,
               That end vpon them should be executed.

               Receiue my teares, and seeme to weepe with me,
               And were they but attired in graue weeds,
               Rome could afford no Tribunes like to these:

               A stone is silent, and offendeth not,
               And Tribunes with their tongues doome men to death.

               I bring consuming sorrow to thine age.
            
            
               Titus.
               will it consume mee? Let me see it then.
            
            
               Marcus.
               This was thy Daughter.
            
            
               Titus.
               why Marcus so shee is.
            
            
               Lucius.
               Ay mee, this Obiect kils mee.
            
            
               Titus.
               Faint-harted-boy, arise and looke vpon her,
               Speake Lauinea, what accursed hand,
               Hath made thee handles in thy fathers sight?
               what foole hath added water to the sea?
               Or brought a faggot to bright burning Troy?
               My griefe was at the height before thou camst,
               And now like Nylus it disdaineth bounds.
               Giue me a sword Ile choppe off my hands too,
               For they haue fought for Rome, and all in vaine:
               And they haue nurst this woe, in feeding life:
               In bootlesse praier haue they beene held vp,
               And they haue serude me to effectles vse.
               Now all the seruice I require of them,
               Is that the one will helpe to cut the other.
               Tis well Lauinia that thou hast no hands,
               For hands to doe Rome seruice is but vaine.
            
            
               Lucius.
               Speake gentle sister, who hath martred thee.
            
            
               Marcus.
               Oh that delightfull engine of her thoughts,
               That blabd them with such pleasing eloquence,
               
                  Is torne from forth that prettie hollow cage,

               Lucius.
               Oh say thou for her, who hath done this deed?
            
            
               Marcus.
               Oh thus I found her straying in the Parke,
               Seeking to hide her selfe, as doth the Deare
               That hath receaude some vnrecuring wound.
            
            
               Titus.
               It was my Deare, and he that wounded her,
               Hath hurt me more than had he kild me dead:
               For now I stand as one vpon a rocke,
               Inuirond with a wildernes of sea,
               VVho markes the waxing tide, grow waue by waue,
               Expecting euer when some enuious surge,
               VVill in his brinish bowels swallow him.
               This way to death my wretched sonnes are gone,
               Here stands my other sonne a banisht man,
               And here my brother weeping at my woes:
               But that which giues my

                  oule the greatest spurne
               Is deare Lauinia, dearer than my soule.
               Had I but seene thy picture in this plight,
               It would haue madded me: what shall I doo,
               Now I behold thy liuelie bodie so?
               Thou hast no hands to wipe away thy teares,
               Nor tongue to tell me who hath martred thee:
               Thy husband he is dead, and for his death
               Thy brothers are condemnde, and dead by this.
               Looke Marcus, Ah sonne Lucius looke on her,
               VVhen I did name her brothers, then fresh teares
               Stood on her cheeks, as doth the honie dew,
               Vpon a gathred Lillie almost withered.
            
            
               Marcus.
               Perchance shee weepes because they kild her husband,
               Perchance, because shee knowes them innocent.
            
            
               Titus.
               If they did kill thy husband then be ioyfull,

               No, no, they would not doo so fowle a deede,
               
                  VVitnes the sorrow that their sister makes.
               Gentle Lauinia, let me kisse thy lips,
               Or make some signe how I may doe thee ease:
               Shall thy good Vncle, and thy brother Lucius,
               
               And thou, and I, sit round about some Fountaine,

               How they are staind like meadowes yet not drie,
               VVith mierie slime left on them by a flood?
               And in the fountaine shall wee gaze so long,
               Till the fresh tast be taken from that clearenes,
               And made a brine pit with our bitter teares?
               Or shall we cut away our hands like thine?
               Or shall we bite our tongues? and in dumbe showes
               Passe the remainder of our hatefull daies?

               And wilt thou haue a reason for this coile?
               I am the sea. Harke how her sighs doth flow:
               Shee is the weeping welkin, I the earth:

               And would vsurpe vpon my watrie eies,

               Then which way shall I find Reuenges Caue,
               For these two heads doe seeme to speake to mee
               And threat me, I shall neuer come to blisse,
               Till all these mischiefes be returnd againe,

               And sweare vnto my soule to right your wrongs,
               The vow is made. Come brother take a head,
               And in this hand the other will I beare,
               And Lauinia thou shalt be imployde in these Armes,

               O Lord sir, tis a deede of pollicie,
               Shall shee liue to betraie this gilt of ours?
               A long tongude babling Gossip, No Lords, no:
               And now be it knowne to you my full intent.
               Not farre, one Muliteus my Countriman
               His wife but yesternight was brought to bed,
               His childe is like to her, faire as you are:
               Goe packe with him, and giue the mother gold,
               And tell them both, the circumstance of all,
               And how by this their childe shall be a duaunst,
               And be receiued for the Emperours Heire,
               And substituted in the place of mine,
               To calme this tempest whirling in the Court,
               And let the Lmperour dandle him for his owne.
               Harke yee Lords, you see I haue giuen her Phisicke,
               And you must needs bestow her Funerall,
               The fields are neere, and you are gallant Groomes:
               This done, see that you take no longer daies,
               But send the Midwife presentlie to mee.
               The Midwife and the Nurse well made away,
               Then let the Ladies tattle what they please.
            
            
               Chi.
               
                  Aron, I see thou wilt not trust the aire with secrets.
            
            
               Demetrius.
               For this care of Tamora,
               
               Her selfe, and hers, are highlie bound to thee.
Exeunt.

               Ah Rome, well, well, I made thee miserable,
               VVhat time I threw the peoples suffrages
               On him that thus doth tyrrannize ore mee.
               Goe get you gone, and pray be carefull all,
               And leaue you not a man of warre vnsearcht,
               This wicked Emperour may haue shipt her hence,
               And kinsemen then we may goe pipe for iustice.

               No my good Lord, but Pluto sends you word,
               If you will haue reuenge from hell you shall,
               Marrie for Iustice shee is so imploid,

               Emillius.
               Arme my Lords, Rome neuer had more cause,
               The Gothes haue gathered head and with a power
               
                  Of high resolued men, bent to the spoile,
               They hither march amaine, vnder conduct
               Of Lucius, sonne to old Andronicus,
               
               VVho threats in course of this reuenge, to doe
               As much as euer Coriolanus did.
            
            
               King.
               Is warlike Lucius Generall of the Gothes,
               
               These tidings nip me, and I hang the head
               As flowers with frost, or grasse beat downe with stormes.
               I now begins our sorrowes to approch,
               Tis he the common people loue so much,
               My selfe hath often heard them say,
               VVhen I haue walked like a priuate man,
               That Lucius banishment was wrongfullie,
               And they haue wisht that Lucius were their Emperour.

               I but the Citizens fauour Lucius,
               
               And will reuolt from me to succour him.

               The Eagle suffers little birds to sing,
               And is not carefull what they meane thereby,
               Knowing that with the shadow of his winges,
               He can at pleasure 
                     •

               Euen so maiest thou the giddie men of Rome,
               Then cheare thy spirit for know thou Emperour,
               I will inchaunt the old Andronicus,
               
               With words more sweete and yet more dangerous
               Then baites to fish, or honniestalkes to sheepe,
               When as the one is wounded with the bait,
               The other rotted with delicious seede.

               But he will not intreat his sonne for vs.
            
            
               Tamora.
               If Tamora intreat him than he will,
               For I can smooth and fill his aged eares,
               VVith golden promises, that were his hart
               Almost impregnable, his old yeares deafe,
               
                  Yet should both eare and hart obay my tongue.
               Goe thou before to be our Ambassador,
               Say that the Emperour requests a parlie,
               Of warlike Lucius, and appoint the meeting,
               Euen at his Fathers house the old Andronicus.
               
            
            
               King.
               
                  Emillius doe this message honourably,
               And if he stand in hostage for his saftie,
               Bid him demaund what pledge will please him best.
            
            
               Emillius.
               Your bidding shall I doe effectually.
            
            Exit.
            
               Tamora.
               Now will I to that old Andronicus,
               
               And temper him with all the Art I haue,
               To plucke proude Lucius from the warlike Gothes.
               
               And now sweet Emperour be blith againe,
               And burie all thy feare in my deuises,

               Then goe sucessantly and plead to him.
            
            Exeunt.
            Enter Lucius with an Armie of Gothes with Drums and Souldiers.
            
               Lucius.
               Approued warriours, and my faithfull friends,
               I haue receaued letters from great Rome,
               VVhich signifies what hate they beare their Emperour,

               Imperious, and impatient of your wrongs,
               And wherein Rome hath done you any skath,
               Let him make treable satisfaction.

               Goth.
               Renowmed Lucius from our troupes I straid,
               To gaze vpon a ruinous Monasterie,

               Vpon the wasted building suddainely,
               I heard a child crie vnderneath a wall,
               I made vnto the noise, when soone I heard,
               The crying babe controld with this discourse:

               Villaine thou mightst haue bin an Emperour.
               But where the bull and Cow are both milke white,
               They neuer doe beget a coleblacke Calfe:
               Peace Villaine peace, euen thus he rates the babe,
               For I must beare thee to a trustie Goth,

               And when I had it drew my selfe a part,
               And almost broke my hart with extreame laughter,
               I pried me through the creuice of a wall,

               And for my tidings gaue me twentie kisses.

               For when no friends are by, men praise themselues.

               Now is my turne to speake, behold the child,
               Of this was Tamora deliuered,
               The issue of an irreligious Moore,
               
               Chiefe architect and plotter of these woes,
               The villaine is aliue in Titus house,
               And as he is to witnes this is true,
               Now iudge what course had Titus to reuenge.
               These wrongs vnspeakeable past patience,
               Or more than any liuing man could beare,
               Now haue you heard the truth, what say you Romaines

               The poore remainder of Andronicie,
               
               VVill hand in hand, all headlong hurle our selues,
               And on the ragged stones beat forth our soules,
               
                  And make a mutuall closure of our house,
               Speake Romans speake, and if you say wee Shall,
               Lo hand in hand Lucius and I will fall.

               Come come thou reuerent man of Rome,
               And bring our Emperour gently in thy hand,
               
                  Lucius our Emperour for well I know,
               The common voice doe cry it shall be so.

               To be adiudge some dyrefull slaughtring death,
               As punishment for his most wicked life.

               Thankes gentle Romanes may I gouerne so,
               To heale Romes harmes, and wipe away her woe,
               But gentle people giue me ayme a while,
               For nature puts me to a heauie taske,

               Teare for teare, and louing kisse for kisse,
               Thy brother Marcus tenders on thy lips,
               Oh were the summe of these that I should pay,
               Countlesse and infinite, yet would I pay them.

               Come hither boy come, come and learne of vs
               To melt in showers, thy Grandsire lou'd thee well,
               Many a time hee daunst thee on his knee,

               Many a storie hath he told to thee,
               And bid thee bare his prettie tales in minde,
               And talke of them when he was dead and gone.

               How manie thousand times hath these poore lips,

               Oh Grandfire, Grandsire, eu'n with all my hart,

               You sad Andronicie haue done with woes,

               Lucius.
               Set him brest deepe in earth and famish him,
               There let him stand and raue and crie for foode.
               If any one releeues or pitties him,
               For the offence he dies, this is our doome,
               Some stay to see him fastned in the earth.

               Ah why should wrath be mute and furie dumb,
               I am no babie I, that with base prayers
               I should repent the euils I haue done,
               Ten thousand worse than euer yet I did
               VVould I performe if I might haue my will,
               If one good deed in all my life I did
               I doe repent it from my verie soule.

               Some louing friends conuay the Emperour hence,
               And giue him buriall in his fathers graue,
               My Father and Lauinia shall forthwith,
               Be closed in our housholds monument,
               As for that rauinous tiger Tamora,
               
               No funerall right, nor man in mourning weede,
               No mournefull bell shall ring her buriall
               But throw her forth to beasts and birds to pray,
               Her life was beastlie and deuoide of pittie,
               And being dead let birds on her take pittie.
            
            Exeunt.
            Finis the Tragedie of Titus Andronicus.
