               SEeing it hath pleaſed God, after ſuch hard ſucceſſe, and the manifold impediments knowne to the world, that now by the wiſdome and induſtry of the Lord Gouernour ſettled in Virginea, the ſtate and buſineſſe of the Engliſh Plantation there ſucceedeth with hope of a moſt proſperous euent, and that therefore it is reſolued and almoſt in a readineſſe, for the further benefit and better ſetling of the ſaid Plantation, to make a new ſupply of men, and all neceſſarie prouiſions, in a Fleet of good Ships, vnder the conduct of Sir Thomas Gates and Sir Thomas Dale Knights, and for that it is not intended any more to burden the action with vagrant and vnneceſſarie perſons: this is to giue notice to ſo many honeſt and induſtrious men, as Carpenters, Smiths, Coopers, Fiſhermen, Tanners, Shoomakers, Shipwrights, Brickmen, Gardeners, Huſbandmen, and labouring men of all ſorts, that if they repaire to the houſe of Sir Thomas Smith in Philpotlane in London, before the end of this preſent moneth of Ianuarie, the number not full, they ſhall be entertained for the Ʋoyage, vpon ſuch termes as their qualitie and fitneſſe ſhall deſerue.
