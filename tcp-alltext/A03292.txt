            TO MY REVErend
Friend, Mr. Dr.
Chaderton, Maſter
of Emanuel Colledge
in Cambridge.
            
               SIr, as a pledge of
the reſpect I owe
you, I haue made
my ſelfe bolde, vnder your
name, to ſet forth this Sermon.
The olde prouerbe,
which forbiddeth to ſend
Owles to Athens, hath
taught mee not to ſend this

to you, as a matter of ſupply:
you (now) liue at the
wel-head (from whence I
confeſſe, and reioyce, my
ſelfe to haue drawne that
little, by which it hath
ſince pleaſed God to enable
me to the doing of ſom
ſeruice in his Church) and
were (long ſince) one of
thoſe iudicious and painful
Diuines, at whoſe feete I
ſate (with many others)
in the dayes of my preparation
to that worke; wherin

I now (by the aſsignement
of the Lorde of the
vineyard) am imployed.
In this therefore, I deſire
rather to be thought to preſent
you with an account of
mine own courſes, thē with
any direction for yours:
The two verſes before this,
I haue preached on, and
the Sermons are abroad.
As I helde it neceſſarie to
treate on this alſo, ſo I
thought it fitting to publiſh
that, which concerning it

was giuen mee to deliuer.
There is no one thing (I
thinke) in which our ordinarie
hearers, are either
more vnskilfull or more
backward, then this dutie
of trying doctrines: what
vnſettledneſſe in opinion,
what vnſoundnes in iudgement,
this hath cauſed, I
doubt not your ſelfe in your
long experience haue obſerued.
If I ſhall preuaile
ought to the curing of this
Epidemicall diſeaſe, I

ſhall glorifie God in that
behalfe. My endeuor that
way, I haue ſhewed in this
ſmall Sermon: vvhich
(here) from your hand, I
commend to the common
vſe of Gods Iſrael: from
Modburie in Deuon.
            
            
               Yours reſpectiuely,
Samuel Hieron.
            
         
      
      
         
            
            
            The Doctrines
triall.
            
               1 Theſ. 5. 21.
               Try all things: and keep that
which is good.
            
            
               I Will not enter into
any courſe of repeating
that which
I taught in my former
Sermon. This in briefe, to
manifeſt the connexion and
order of both;The order of the place. both my two
Texts, & Lectures. In the former
we were taught the neceſſitiy

of diligent and reſpectiue
dependance vpon the preaching
of the Word, vnleſs we
will preſumptuouſly and vnwarrantably
aduenture our
ſelues vpon the neglect of the
ordinarie way, by which God
is pleaſed to collect & gather
his, vnto himſelf. We are now
to bee informed, with what
wiſedome it becommeth vs to
behaue our ſelues in awayting
vpon this ordinance of
God; that ſo wee may reape
that good by it, which in the
purpoſe of God is intended in
it.The general ſcope thereof. A ſeruice, in it ſelfe, and in
it owne nature, wholeſome &
profitable, may yet in the maner
of vſing it bee depraued.

Hearing is a very neceſſarie
and an important dutie: and
yet, a man through his owne
default may be conſtant and
continuall in it to his hurt, rather
then to his benefit. To
the end therefore wee may ſo
attend vpon this exerciſe of
Prophecying, as that thereby
wee may be edified in our holy
faith, Paul commendeth
here vnto vs, two neceſſarie
vertues:The diuiſion of it. 1 Diſcretion: 2 Conſtancy.
Diſcretion, to try all
things. Conſtancy, to holde
faſt that, which is found vpon
tryall to be good. To retaine
ought in Religion ſtifly, before
a man haue tryed it thorowly,
what greater folly? This is

wilfulneſſe rather and Pertinacy,
then true Conſtancy.
Againe; to examine points
diligently, and then to neglect
them careleſly, what greater
vanity? It is a great deale
of labour to no vſe. But to
ſift and ſcanne that which is
heard, exactly, and to maintaine
that which is found to
holde at the touch reſolutely,
this is the glory and credit of
Chriſtianity. Of theſe two
points I am now in order to
intreat.
            Concerning the firſt,The firſt Doctrine. this is
the Doctrine; That it is the
dutie of thoſe which honour
preaching as the meanes appointed
for ſaluation, To try

things taught, before they
giue their full and abſolute
yeelding thereunto: Who
that lookes vpon the place,
but hee will foorthwith conceiue
this to bee the doctrine?
The aduice of the ſpirite of
God is, that our honouring
of prophecying, ſhould bee
accompanied with trying it.
So reſpect it, as that you bind
not your ſelues to a receiuing
without enquirie, hand ouer
head, whatſoeuer is commended
by it. Heereto is that
charge to be referred, of trying
the ſpirits1 Iohn 4. 1, that is, of examining
their perſons & doctrines,
who profeſſe to ſpeake
vnto vs by the Spirit. It remaineth

vpon record, as an honour
to the Nobles of Berea,
and it is a rule for vs, that hearing
Paul and Silas preach
they were diligent in ſearching,
whether the things they
ſpake were ſoAct. 17. 11.
            The courſe of ſeeking holy
knowledge, at the mouthes of
thoſe, whoſe lippes by their
calling ought to preſerue itMat. 2. 7,
is tearmed by Salomon, a buying
of the TruthPr. 23. 23. As therefore
in buying, it is euery
mans wiſedome to conſider
the wares which are tendered
to him,Gyrare negotiatorem vnum & alterum. how they are conditioned,
and (as Chryſoſtom ſaith
pithily to this purpoſe) to go
from ſhop to ſhop,Chry. Hom. 44. in opere imperfect. and from

chapman to chapman, to look
where hee may haue the beſt,
before hee make a through
bargaine: ſo it ought to bee
the care of a prudent Chriſtian,
to conſider of particulars,
which are taught, before
he giue them entertainement.
Take heede how you heare,
ſaid our SauiourLuk. 8. 18.; Doth not
this Take heed in hearing intend
a tryall of things heard?
Conſider two things with me;
and the truth, equitie, and neceſsitie
of this doctrine will
ſoone bee yeelded to. The
one is the poſsibilitie of beeing
deceiued in our dependance
vpon prophecying.
The other is, the danger of

miſtaking. The poſsibility of
beeing deceiued, proceeds
from two things: 1 Somewhat
in them which prophecy: 2.
Somewhat in our ſelues, who
liſten thereunto. Touching
them which prophecy, there
are two ſorts by whom there
is danger of deceit. 1 Some
purpoſe to deceiue: 2 Some
caſually may deceiue. Some
purpoſe to deceiue, whom the
Apoſtle tearmeth, liers in
wait to deceiueEph. 4. 14, and whom
hee compares (according
to the nature of the Greeke
word vſed) to cheaters and
falſe gameſters,
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
                who haue deuices
by cogging dice, to deceiue
the vnskilful. Theſe

ſpeake peruerſe thingsAct. 20. 30▪
               , and
priuily bring in damnable hereſies
2 Pet. 2. 1. It hath been an ancient
practice of the diuell, to
be a lying ſpirit in the mouthes
of ſome Prophets1 Kin. 22 22; There
haue beene euer ſome miſleading
leadersIſa. 3. 12, cauſers of
the people to erre by their
lyesIer. 23. 32; and Saint Peter hath
aſſured vs, that in this particular,
the latter times will hold
proportion with the former2 Pet. 2. 1:
Still there will be ſome ſeedsmen
of Tares amongſt them
that ſowe the purer Wheate;
ſome temperers of Leauen,
with the ſweet lumpe of Gods
ſacred Truth. Others there are
againe, which may caſually

deceiue, & they are alſo of two
ſorts. The one ſort are ſuch as
may lead the people into error
(though perhaps it be not
their purpoſe) throgh their inſufficiency,
their rawneſs, their
vnskilfulnes, their negligence,
for & in the diſcharge of this
great ſeruice of inſtructing.
Too many ſuch there be, who
wanting the tong of the Learned
Iſa. 50. 4, who lacking Iudgement
Mica. 3. 8, and skill of right diuiding
the word of Truth2 Tim. 2 15, &
beeing no well taught ſcribes
to the kingdome of heauenMat. 13. 52,
and then withall being careleſſe
of that charge, touching
taking heed to Doctrine1 Tim. 4 16, do
vent many things vnſound &

vnſauorie, ſometimes things
vain & fooliſh, as the Scripture
tearmeth themLam. 2. 14 ordinarily,
ſuch as God neuer commanded,
nor ſpake, neither euer
came into his mindeIer. 19. 5, wherby
the mindes of the ſimple
are deceiuedRom. 16 18, and the hearts
of the righteous made ſadEze. 13. 22.
Theſe be ſuch as Paul calleth
Deceiued deceiuers2 Tim. 3 13. They
are beguiled themſelues,
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . and
ſo beguile others. I will not
be ſo vncharitable as to range
ſuch among purpoſed deceiuers:
yet this I ſay, they themſelues,
beeing through vnskilfulneſſe
and negligence
miſtaken, & doing the Lords
worke more remiſly then is

fit, they become an occaſion
of erring vnto others. When
men come to the handling of
holy things, not well inſtructed
themſelues, and then doe
that which they doe, without
any great conſcience (it may
be they doe it for forme, and
binde themſelues to ſpeak according
to the Times) it cannot
bee auoided (though it
may be, their hearts are not
ſo nought as to meane deceit)
but ſometimes others by
them ſhall be in danger to be
miſled. The ſecond ſort of
ſuch as caſually may deceiue,
are euen the beſt, the moſt
ſufficient & faithful Teachers.
It is poſsible, that euen ſuch,

notwithſtanding all their care,
may at a time deliuer that
which is not ſafe to entertain.
None ſince Chriſt, neither
companies of men, nor particular
perſons, haue had the
infallible aſsiſtance of the holy
Ghoſt, except the Apoſtles.
Our knowledge here is but in
part1 cor. 13. 9. In ſundry things (as
men) wee are many times
much miſtaken. And it falleth
out many times, thorough
Gods wiſe diſpenſing, that
ſomewhat is reuealed to him
which ſitteth by, which hee
who occupieth the roome of
the Teacher, doth not vnderſtand;
as is gatherable out of
that ſaying of the Apoſtle,

(1 Cor. 14. 30.) This is the
firſt thing out of which there
ſprings a poſsibility of being
deceiued. The ſecond, is from
out of our ſelues which come
to heare. We are naturally in
matters of Religion eaſily miſcaried,
by reaſon of the vanity
of minde, and darkneſs
of cogitation, which we haue
brought with vs from the
WombeEph. 4. 18: wee are vnwiſe by
nature and deceiued1 Tit. 3. 3. And
then what through preſumption,
truſting too much to our
ſelues, what through a kinde
of natiue lothneſſe to endure
the paynes of Trying, what
through an affectation of Nouelty,
we are very lyable to

deceit, apt to drinke-in error
as water, and to bee carried
vp & downe with euery wind
of doctrineEph. 4. 14. As it is ſaid of
vs in the generall, that we are
clay to God, and wax to the
diuell: ſo may it bee applyed
to vs in the particular, that we
are hardly wrought to an entertainement
of a truth, but
ſoone wonne to the embracing
of an error. The Iewes
in regarde of their vntowardneſſe
to good, were tearmed
ſtiffe-neckedAct. 7. 51, and a gaineſaying
peopleRom. 10 21, and yet ſoone
turned out of the way which
God commanded themEx. 32. 8; and
the Galatians were ſoone remooued
to another GoſpellGal. 1. 8,

and yet the paynes of forming
Chriſt in them was as a
trauailing in birthGal. 4. 19. Euer
ſince the razing out of vs the
image of the God of truth,
there hath been in our nature
ſuch an affinitie with falſhood,
that that which S. Paul calls the
deceiueableneſs of vnrighteouſneſſe
2 Theſ. 2 10., is very preuailing,
ſpeedily to entangle vs. That
ſame canker or gangreane of
vntruth doth ſoone ſeize vpon
vs, and it fretteth2 Tim. 2. 17 apace
when it hath once begunne.
Hereupon, the bringers in of
hereſies haue many to follow
their damnable wayes2 Pet. 2. 2: and
Antichriſt hath ſmall & great,
rich and poore, to receiue his

markeApoc. 13 16. Now for the danger
of erring in matters of this
kinde, it is not hard to diſcouer
it. Religion is a matter
which concernes the ſoule,
and the euerlaſting happineſs
thereof. A miſtaking therefore
muſt needs be followed,
with a more then ordinarie
hurt. I know there are differences
and degrees of errors
in matters of Religion. Some
do ſtrike more directly to the
heart of piety, and weaken
the very maine foundation of
faith. Some are not altogether
of ſo dāgerous a nature; being
in points of leſſe importance.
The former are as mortall diſeaſes
in the body: the other

are but as ſuperfluous humours
within, or ſwelling tumours
without. But yet as in
the bodie, ſmaller griefes,
when they are multiplyed and
continued, become preiudiciall
to the life of the whole:
ſo theſe inferiour kindes of
miſtakings, when they are
ordinarie & encreaſed, grow
dangerous, to the Maine. A
little leauen doth leauen the
whole lumpeGal. 5. 9: It is applyed
by the Apoſtle, to ſhew what
incōuenience followes the entertainmēt
of (as it may ſeem)
a pettie error in the things of
God. The withall in the day
of tentation, when a man is
either before the world called

into queſtion for that which
he doth profeſſe, or elſe is ſifted
and winnowed by Satan,
about that which he beleeues;
how woefull and hazardous
ſhall his caſe be, if hee haue
taken vp his religion onely
(as I may ſo ſpeake) vpon
truſt, or rayſed it vp out of
his owne ſurmiſe! There is
neither of theſe, but will bee
a poore ground for him to relie
vpon, in the time of Triall.
Small courage ſhall one haue,
to engage his life for that, for
which his beſt proofe is the
authority of him from whom
he receiued it: and it will
not be eaſie to anſwer the diuell,
by alleadging the name

of a man, vnleſſe he be able to
iuſtifie his Tenent by diuine
authoritie. So then, if either we
conſider the eaſineſſe of erring
in matters of Religion,
or the perill of miſtaking therin,
we muſt needes acknowledge
this doctrine, touching
the Triall of doctrines, to be
true. How ſhall this eaſineſs
to erre bee preuented? how
ſhall this danger of not going
aright be auoided? but by this
one courſe of conſidering all
things, and of examining each
point, before wee build vpon
it as a certaintie.
            The diuell labours to poiſon
the fountain of Truth (the
publicke Miniſtrie) ſo that oft

times there ſtreame euen
from it very dangerous conceits:
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  .
and the olde ſaying
may bee well applyed to our
profeſsion, Many good inches,
but few good ploughmen:
So, many aduenturers to
ſpeake from the pulpit; not
ſo many who obſerue the rule,
of ſpeaking as the words of
God1 Pet. 4. 11, and then the beſt ſomtimes
are ouerſhot. I remēber
what we learned when we were
boyes;Cicero Offi. lib. 3 How one Cannius was
cozened in the buying of a
garden in an Iland. The ſeller
firſt inuited him to it, and
for that day hired diuers fiſhermen,
to attend the banks
with boates and nets, and to

bring in plenty of fiſh, and to
lay it at his feet, making Cannius
beleeue (who wondered
at it) that it was the royalty of
the place, and that that ſeruice
was due to him, as Lord of the
garden, whenſoeuer he came
thither. Cannius beleeuing
him, and being much in loue
with ſuch a commodity, would
needes haue the garden, and
paid for it to the purpoſe.
Shortly after, he had a diſpoſition,
to let ſome of his friends
ſee what a purchaſe hee had
made, and brought them
to the garden to bee merry,
making full account that the
fiſhermen would bee there,
both to ſhew him paſtime, &

to preſent him with a tribute
of fiſh. When hee ſaw neither
boate, nor fiſherman, nor net,
hee asked his neighbours whether
it where holy-day with
fiſhermen: They anſwered
none that they knew of; and
added withall, that they wondred
at the late reſorte of fiſhermen
there, as a thing vnvſuall
in that place. Vpon this,
Cannius perceiued hee was
cozened: but it was too late; he
could not helpe it. And thus
may an heedleſs perſon be deceiued
in his dependance vpō
Gods ordināce: He may meet
with ſome crafty Pythius (for
ſo was hee called who deceiued
Cannius) who may commend

a doctrine to him, and
ſet it out with many plauſible
tearmes, as if it were of ſuch
and ſuch excellent vſe for a
mans ſoule; which yet, when
it is brought to triall ſhall be
found to yeelde out no ſuch
matter as was promiſed. Thus
ſtill may this point be amplified,
touching the poſsibilitie
to receiue infection, euen by
preaching: to which when we
ſhall ioyne our owne aptneſſe
to be miſled, and the perill
of going awry, the generall
point muſt needes bee yelded
to; namely, that in receiuing
of doctrines▪ Trying ought to
goe before Truſting; we muſt
labour to bee ſure that which

we intend to keepe is good,
before wee ſet vpon the keeping
of it as good.
            This point of doctrine,The vſe.
makes to the diſcouerie (I
wiſh alſo it may ſo pleaſe God,
to the recouerie) of three
great euils, which are very
preuailing, and very vniuerſall
in theſe our Times. 1 Wilfulneſſe.
2 Careleſneſs. 3 Vnskilfulneſſe.
The firſt of theſe
is a froward humour. The ſecond,
a negligent humor. The
third, a ſottiſh humour. They
are ouercomne with the firſt,
who plead for their excuſe, in
either not hearing, or not crediting
any whom they heare;
the variety of opinions to bee

found among preachers, and
the poſsibility of beeing deceiued
by dependance on
them; ſcarcely two of them
of a minde (ſay ſome) and
therefore my reſolution is, I
will beleeue none. How doth
this agree with the Rule of
Trying all things? It is not the
counſell of the holy Ghoſt,
becauſe there is a ſpirit of errour
in the mouthes of many,
and the beſt learned may miſtake,
therefore ceaſe to hear;
but becauſe it is thus, be ſure
to try. This bindes to iudiciall
hearing, it giues no warrant
to deſiſt from hearing. Wilt
thou rather ſtarue, becauſe of
a poſsibility to bee poyſoned?

or goe naked and neere the
winde, becauſe in the ſhops
of them that ſell, thou mayſt
be cozened? or lie downe in
the ſtreete, or by the hedge,
becauſe (perhaps) thou maiſt
either goe wrong, or ſtumble
on the way? Our Sauiour
would haue his Diſciples learn
and inquire, and ſeeke to
bee ſure what he was, though
ſome ſaide one thing, ſome
another, touching himMat. 16 13. 15.
That I may bee deceiued,
muſt encreaſe my care, not
ouerthrow my diligence.
            Now touching the ſecond
euill, of careleſſeneſſe, it is to
be ſeene in thoſe, who are apt
to take all for ſound & good,

which is deliuered. If they can
countenance that which they
ſeeme to maintaine, with the
name of a Teacher, or ſay, it
was deliuered at a Sermon,
they thinke it is enough. Eſpecially
there is euen a kinde
of Idolatry committed by
ſome, in ſelling themſelues ſo
to ſome mens iudgements,
that they doe in a manner repute
euery word an Oracle
which they ſpeake. It is ſufficient
for them, if ſuch or ſuch
a man hath ſaid it. This is euen
a ſpice of that which Saint
Paul tearmes a being ſeruants
to men,1 Cor. 7 23.. It is to haue ones
faith more in the wiſedome of
man, then in the power of

God1 Cor. 2. 5. Let a man eſteme of
vs, as the miniſters of God1 Cor. 4. 1,
but yet, not as men in whom,
but by whom, you belieue1 Cor. 3. 5.
Were he an Angel from heauen,
yet his Goſpel muſt bee
looked intoGal. 1. 8. Hearken to a
matter becauſe wee ſay it; ſo
much wee may chalenge by
our place: but doe not belieue
it, vntill you knowe vpon
what ground wee haue ſpoken
it. Could wee once
work a conſcience of this dutie
in our hearers, many who
doe now deſpiſe our doctrine,
would then approoue it; and
they which doe approoue it,
would finde ten times more
ſweetneſſe in it then they doe.
            
               
But now commeth the
third euill, at the leaſt as bad
as the two former, and that is
vnskilfulneſſe. This reacheth
farre. For, beſides, that they
who are guilty of the two before
named, are alſo chargeable
with this; euen they who
are better diſpoſed, and haue
a kinde of inclination to the
dutie of Triall, yet want that
skill, and ableneſſe for it,
which is neceſſarie. It is not
eaſie, no not among the beſt
profeſſors, to finde a man that
hath an exerciſed wit, to diſcerne
both good and euillHeb. 5. 14▪
               .
A witty and ingenious man,
well ſpoken, and able to carry
a matter handſomely, & to

ſet it out with a ſmooth and
pleaſing phraſe, would ſoone
deceiue euen a great many of
thoſe which meane well.
            Quickly might a man of
Arts and Parts, make many of
vs to ſtagger, euen touching
thoſe very things which hitherto
haue gone with vs for
currant, and wherein we haue
ſeemed very confident. A
man might ſo lap vp the poiſonous
drugs of Poperie, and
ſo gild them ouer with the
ſeeming allowance of Scripture,
& of hore-headed Antiquity,
that euen the greateſt
part would ſoone ſwallow
them downe without ſuſpicion.
This is a truth, but a lamentable

truth. What pittie is
it, that after this long Sunneſhine
of the Goſpel in this
Land, there ſhould be ſo many,
who but (as Saint Peters
tearme is) ſee glimmeringly,
and vncertainely, like one
who cannot ſee a farre of2 Pet. 1. 9 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
               ,
in matters of Religion; and
like Zebut in the holy ſtorie,
either take men to be but the
ſhadowes of mountaines, or
the ſhadowes of mountaines
to be menIud. 9. 36. They know not
what to make of many things,
what to conceiue, or how to
determine. And as Abſalom
and the Elders of Iſrael, at
the firſt gaue a generall approbation
to Ahitophels aduice,

and were ready to follow
it, but by and by, ſaid the
counſell of Huſhai the Archite
was a great deale better, and
ſo did accordingly2 Sam. 17 4. 14.: ſo they
who now ſay, Surely this is the
truth which we muſt bide by,
within a while are apt to cry
out, Nay but this is the better,
and like the Lyſtrians in the
ſtory, bee ready to caſt him

            Now happie might I account
my ſelfe, if the doctrine
which I haue framed out of
this Text might become a

purgatiue receit, for the remoouing
of theſe three malignant
humors; then the
which, I profeſſe I know none,
which doe more preiudice
the good concoction of that
heauenly & wholeſome doctrine
which is taught vs. If we
can ſay, this Text is not the
word of God, or that it hath
no authority to binde vs, or
that it doth not directly make
againſt theſe 3 corruptiōs, I ſee
no cauſe but wee may cheriſh
them, and maintain our ſelues
in them: but otherwiſe, it becommeth
vs vpon the paine
of the moſt High his diſpleaſure,
to caſt aſide all either
frowardneſſe, or neglect in

this matter, and to labour to
haue skill in the performance
of this Trying dutie. We diſclaime
all Lordſhip ouer your
faith2 Cor. 1. 24, we are ſet ſet on work
for the ſeruice of your faithPhil. 2. 17,
not for commanding it. We
leaue it to Papiſts, to tyrannize
ouer mens thoughts in matters
of Religion, and to require
the people to lappe vp
their faith in the generall beleeuing
of the Church. Wee
deſire you to Try, we beſeech
you to enquire, wee would
faine bring you to ſtand in the
wayes and askeIer. 6. 16, wee knowe
you can neuer till then haue
ſtabliſhed heartsHeb. 13. 9; you can
neuer attaine to that of beeing

fully perſwaded euery man in
his owne mindeRom. 14. 5: and when
you ſhall doe this, you will ſay
to vs, who haue preached
to you, as the Samaritanes
ſaid to the woman, Now wee
beleeue not, becauſe of your
ſayings, for we haue found it
our ſelues, and knowe that
this and this is ſo indeedIoh. 4. 42: or
after after ſome ſuch ſorte as
the Queene of the South ſaid

which wee now feele in Religion

            Now becauſe, if I ſhould
winne you all to a reſolution
of Trying doctrines, and then
leaue you doubtfull how and

which way to performe it, my
courſe would be vnprofitable:
therefore you ſhall giue mee
leaue to beſtowe ſome paines
that way, and to giue ſome neceſſarie
directions in that behalfe.
That there is a meanes
to attain to ſome ſufficiency for
the diſcharge of this ſeruice,
why ſhold I go about to proue?
God would neuer bid vs Try,
if it were not poſsible for vs to
be able to Try. Now all Triall
of doctrine muſt bee by ſome
Rule. The Greeke word here
tranſlated Try, betokens, ſuch
a triall as Gold-ſmiths vſe touching
metall; for the diſcerning
whereof they haue a touchſtone,
at which that which will

not hold, is reiected and laide
by as counterfeit. A touchſtone
there muſt be ſought, for
this buſineſſe. And when wee
haue found it, we muſt vnderſtand
how to make vſe of it, to
that end. The maine Touch by
which all doctrine muſt be tryed,
and by which it muſt either
ſtand or fall, is the will of God
reuealed in the Scriptures.
Bring them to the Law, and to
the Teſtimonie (ſaide the Oracle
of God of olde) and conſider

it was the inuention of the diuell
to permit the people to

preſſe you with that of the Apoſtle,

            Thus haue wee found the
touchſtone: let vs now enquire
how it muſt bee vſed. A little
childe, or a foole may eaſily
finde a touchſtone, and yet
when he hath it, not know what

to doe with it, more then with
an other ordinarie pibble.
Though the Scripture bee not
ſo common as it ſhould, yet
it is conuerſed with by more,
then can tell how to turn it vnto
good. This then ſhall be the
next parte of my taske, to ſhew
how the Scripture may bee
made vſe of, for the Tryall of
doctrines.
            And heere there are two
things conſiderable. 1 How he
muſt be qualified, who aduentureth
to meddle with the
Scripture. 2 How beeing ſo
qualified as is neceſſarie, hee
may be able to apply it to this
vſe. Firſt, whoſo puts his hand
to the Scripture in deſire to get

skill by it, ſo, as that by the
helpe thereof he may be able
to examine doctrines, it is meet
eſpecially that hee be a man of
an humble ſpirit. They bee
the humble, to whom the Lord
giueth grace1 Pet. 5. 5, hee dwelleth
with ſuchIſa. 57. 15, hee teacheth his
way to ſuch, to them he reuealeth
his ſecretsPſal. 25. 9 14: a man muſt
humble himſelfe, that hee may
walke with his GodMic. 6. 8 Modò ad hautiendum accedat deuotè. Aug. de vtilitate credendi. c. 6. It is a
good ſpeech of Auguſtines, The
doctrine of the Scripture is ſo
tempered, that there is no man
but may draw thence ſufficient
for himſelfe, prouided that he
come vnto it with Deuotion.
Now, that which the Scripture
meaneth by humblenes of ſpirit

in this caſe, and Auguſtine by
Deuotion, is this; A yeelding
of a mans ſelfe ouer to bee
taught of God, out of a reſolued
and ſtrong opinion, that
he is of himſelfe but a foole
in the things of God. This
is that which the Apoſtle calleth
a beeing a foole, to the
end that he may be wiſe1 Cor. 3 18. They
be the ſimple, to whom the
word of the Lord giues ſharpneſſe
of witPro. 1. 4. The ſumme is
this in a word (that I may not
dwel vpon this particular); Except
a man be ſenſible in himſelfe
of mans natiue dulneſſe
in the matters of God, of the
vnfitneſs of his reaſon to iudge
and to determine in points of

that nature, and ſo reſolue to
ſubmit himſelfe wholly to be
taught of God, and to conforme
himſelfe and to ſubdue
his thoughts, and to frame
them to that which hee ſhall
reueale, it is vnpoſsible that he
ſhould euer, be by the Scriptures
made wiſe vnto ſaluation.
Now the beſt euidence of
ones being furniſhed with this
worthy quality, is his binding
himſelfe not to looke into the
Scripture without praier. Thus
did Dauid bewray the meekeneſſe
of his ſpirit, by begging
of God to open his eyes, to
ſee the wonders of the LawPſ. 119. 18,
by praying him to giue him
vnderſtandingPſ. 119. 34, to teach him

good iudgement and knowledge
Pſ. 119. 66. This ſhewed Dauid
to haue renounced all opinion
of his owne ſufficiency,
and to haue reſigned himſelfe
ouer wholly to the Lords guidance.
Hee would not truſt
himſelfe in wading into theſe
depthes: but in more then a
iealouſie ouer himſelfe, hee
caſt himſelfe altogether vpon
God. It is but as Paul calleth
it, vaine iangling1 Tim. 1. 6, and ſcience
falſely ſo called1 Tim. 6 20, a kind
of frothie knowledge, whatſoeuer
men get out of the
Scripture, aduenturing on it,
without this quality. Determine
if thou wouldeſt get
ought out of Gods booke, by

which thy ſoule may bee ſatisfied
as with marow and fatneſſe,
neuer to betake thy ſelfe
to the vſe of it, but to vrge
that vpon thy ſelfe, which the
woman of Samaria, ſcoffingly
ſaid to Chriſt, Thou haſt
nothing to draw with, and the
well is deepeIoh. 4, 11, without thee
O Lord,Orandus eſt deus & dicendum cū Apoſtolit, ediſsere nobis hanc parabolam. Hier. Epi. ad Pammachiū
                I ſhall depart empty
away. God muſt bee prayed
vnto, and wee muſt ſay with
the Apoſtles, Lord ſhew vs
this parable.
            Now when a man is thus addreſſed
and prepared with an
humble, yeelding, and reſigned
ſpirit, his next care muſt
be, to be furniſhed out of the
Scripture with ſome matter of

Rule, by which hee may ſtill
in his hearing courſe, make
that tryall which is neceſſarie.
This matter of Rule, I may
thus diſtinguiſh; It is either
more generall, or more ſpeciall
and particular. The more
generall matter of Rule, is the
doctrine of Catechiſme. I will
ſhew you what I meane hereby.
There is a thing, which
Paul in one place calleth the
Forme of doctrine
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . Rom. 6. 17.; in another,
the Patterne of wholeſome
words
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . 2 Tim. 1. 13; elſe where, The
doctrine of the beginning of
ChriſtHeb. 6. 1. It is a certaine frame
of ſacred Truth, rayſed out
of plaine, direct, and vnqueſtiond
Texts of holy Scripture,

manifeſting by the way of abridgement,
the order and
courſe of mans ſaluation, to
whom he muſt looke vp for
it, and by what way & meanes
he muſt come to it. He which
doth not beginne at this, ſhall
neuer come vnto that in Religion,
which is called the Certainty
Luk. 1. 4. There was a courſe
of teaching this in the Apoſtles
dayes, as may be gathered
out of Heb 6. 1. and hath
beene continued in all well
gouerned Churches euer ſince.
And I am verely perſwaded,
that one ſpeciall reaſon, why
both many, who are for profeſsion
Diuines, are ſtaggering
and vncertaine, and various in

pointes of diuinity, and ſubiect
to drawing this way, and
that way, either by the Times,
or by ſuch Authors as they
meete with; and diuers alſo of
our people, of all rankes are
ſo vnſettled, and ſo by and by
puzled, vpon the raiſing vp
of a new or ſtrange point of
doctrine, is, they were neuer
well broght vp in the grounds
of Chatechiſme. And it is a
great errour both amongſt vs
Miniſters, that this kinde of
Teaching is ſo little in our
practice; & amongſt the people,
that where it is vſed it is
ſo little in eſteem. Neuer ſhall
a man bee other then raw in
Religion, that was not well

ſeaſoned with the firſt rudiments.
Theſe muſt be to him
like the patternes which ſome
craftſmen haue, by which they
proportion out their worke:
That which they heare, if it
hold not agreement with theſe
principles, it muſt be reiected
as vnſound. Theſe our daies
afford many helpes in this
kinde, and our neglect herein
is the more without excuſe. If
you ſhall giue this point, but a
little time and roome in your
thoughts to bee here conſidered
of, I make no doubt, but
you will all confeſſe it to bee
true.
            Now the more ſpeciall and
particular Rule, is either for

the deciding of the great
queſtion betwixt vs and papiſts,
or for our direction and
ſettlement in that ordinarie
preaching which is amongſt
our ſelues. Touching Popery,
wee ſhall finde that courſe
which Salomon tooke for the
trying of the two Harlots
which came before him, whether
was the true mother, whē
both were therein very confident
1 King. 3▪
               , to be of very ſpecial vſe
for the triall thereof, and for
the confirming of a mans determination
touching it, that it
is but counterfeit. Shee who
could bee content the liuing
childe ſhould be diuided, Salomon
gaue his verdit vpon

her, that ſurely ſhee was not
the mother. Vnity is a matter
much boaſted of by papiſts,
yet there is nothing ſo
pregnant againſt them as this
point of diuiſion. For whereas
God will haue all reſerued
to himſelfe, and will admit no
copartinarie (I will not giue
my glory to anotherIſa. 42. 8,) we ſhal
finde Poperie in the points of
Chriſtian religion, to admit
(clean cōtrary to the fundamē
               tall
lawes of heauen) as it were
a Gauel-kinde cuſtome, and
to allow ſhares with God, in
the things wherein hee will endure
no partners; as for example:
Adoration is diuided
betwixt God & Images. The

ſeruice of prayer betwixt God
and creatures. Mediation to
the diuine Maieſty, betwixt
Chriſt and Saints. The headſhip
of the Church▪ betwixt
Chriſt & the Pope. The conuerſion
of a Sinner, betwixt
the freedome of Gods grace,
and the freedome of mans
will. Iuſtification, betwixt faith
and workes. The ground of
a Chriſtian mans faith, beetwixt
Scriptures and Tradions.
Abſolute obedience betwixt
Gods Commandements,
and the precepts of the
Church. And ſo in other
things, for I giue you but a
taſte. Take we this for a certaine
Rule, by which to iudge

of the doctrine of Popery. It
is content like the pretended
mother to diuide thoſe things
betwixt two, or moe, which
ought of right to bee reſerued
vnto one. I dare vndertake,
that in the maine points of Religion,
there is a making ouer,
more or leſſe, from God
to ſomewhat elſe, all that glorie,
that reſpect, that dependance
vpon, that reuerence,
that acknowledgement, which
by vertue of the firſt Commandement
is his peculiar. I
would faine ſee, how the doctrine
of the Church of Rome
can bee freed from diſperſing
thoſe affections and powers
of the heart vnto ſundry particulars,

which the Lord requireth
to be giuen wholly vnto
him. Let the matter bee thorowly
examined: and if the
ſeuerall points of that Religion,
which wee profeſſe and
preach in the Church of England
at this day, bee not like
the lines in a Circumference,
which al meet in this one Center
of Gods glory, and of that
maine ayme of God in all his
proceedings, He that reioyceth,
let him reioyce in the
Lord1 Cor. 1. 31, we may freely allowe
you to diſclaime it. Wee will
neuer feare to ioyne iſſue with
Papiſts in this: wee will neuer
decline, nay we will entreat &
ſue for this Triall.
            
               
Now for direction in dependance
vpon our ordinarie
preaching, I commend this eſpecially
to the obſeruation &
vſe of common men. For I
now labour not ſo much to
giue precepts for thoſe that
be learned, and haue helps by
Arts and Tongues & reading,
to ſcan the things which are
preſented to them: but I endeauour
to guide thoſe, who
haue no more for their ayde
in this ſeruice, then common
education hath afforded them.
I remember a ſaying of Pauls,
               1 Cor. 10. 15
Iudge you (ſaid he) what I ſay.
Me thinks I may thence conclude,
that there is ſomewhat
within the ſoule & conſcience

of the hearer, by which hee
muſt determine touching that
which commeth to him, whether
it bee meet to giue it entertainement,
yea or no. There
is a certaine hid man of the
heart1 Pet. 3. 4, which muſt bee iudge
in this caſe. Thou muſt try that
which thou heareſt, by the
work which it hath vpon thy
ſoule. There be three ſpeciall
things which I may tearme the
aime of the whole Scripture.
That doctrine wch tends to the
furtherance of all, or either of
theſe three, a man may ſafely
build vpon it, that it is true:
That which is a let or an impediment
to any of theſe three,
it muſt be reiected as vnſound.

The three things, are, 1 Humility.
2 Comfort. 3 Conſcience
of obedience. The whole
Scripture driues to theſe three:
1 To abaſe man in his owne
eyes, & to lay him in the duſt.
2 To refreſh his ſoule, and to
bring his bones wch haue bin
broken, to reioyce. 3 To frame
his heart to a conſtant deſire &
care of pleaſing God. Theſe
be three things ſimply neceſſarie
to the compoſition of a
right Chriſtian. Hereupon the
Scripture is ſo exact in laying
open the corruption of mans
naturall eſtate, in ſetting out
the foulneſſe, and haynouſnes
of ſinne, in deſcribing the rigour
of Gods iuſtice, in declaring

the terror of that which
is the beſt of mans deſert. Here
upon (ſecondly) it is, that it ſo
gratiouſly diſcouereth the myſtery
of Chriſt, the fulneſſe of
the grace which is in him, the
riches of Gods mercy through
him, euery way anſwering a
mans ſpiritual neceſsity. Hereupon
(thirdly) it is, that it ſo
preciſely & ſtraightly preſſeth
the duties of holineſs, giuing
no manner of liberty to mans
owne naturall inclination, but
binding him to a finiſhing his
ſaluation with fear & trēbling,
and to a cauſing his heart to be
in the feare of God continually.
Marke thou this then: Exaamine
thine owne ſoule how

that which thou heareſt helpeth
thee onwards in either of
theſe three; how it beats down
the naturall pride & preſumption
of thy heart, ſtriuing to
make thee vile in thine owne
eyes; how it acquaints thee
with the Fulneſs of Chriſt, and
directs the for the ſettling of
thine abaſed & trembling ſoule
vpon him; how it hedgeth thee
in, in thoſe exceſſes thou art
inclinable to; how it limits and
ſtints thee in the things wherein
thou wouldeſt faine haue liberty;
how it tieth thee vp, and
vrgeth thee to a kinde of ſtrict
and circumſpect walking. If
thou finde it thus to work, embrace
it, reſt vpon it, lay it vp,

hide it in the midſt of thy heart,
it ſhall be health to thy nauill,
and marowe to thy bones. If
thou heareſt a doctrine taught,
which thou findeſt to extenuate
the corruption of mans nature,
or to darken and obſcure
that aboundant mercy which
is in Chriſt, weakning that aſſurance
which an afflicted ſoule
deſireth by him, or to hearten
the euill inclination of the hart,
and to giue ſome liberty to the
fleſh, and to ſeeme to make
ſome of thoſe courſes tolerable
which thou (as a man) art ready
to affect; beware thereof, as
of poyſon to thy ſoule. It is
not that truth which thou muſt
hearken to. I haue ſet you

downe a Rule, which if you
pleaſe to obſerue and practice
you ſhall finde to be exceeding
vſefull. That which thou heareſt,
if thou perceiue that it
humbleth and checketh thee in
thy ſecurity, comforts thee in
thy perplexity, curbs thee in,
in thy deſired liberty, thou
maiſt be bolde to ſay, It is the
Truth of God. All the falſhood
which in theſe dayes generally
we are in danger of, faileth in
one of theſe 3 particulars. If I
ſhall ſhew you an experiment
of this Rule, it wil be the better
vnderſtood, & the better credited.
I pray be pleaſed to ioyne
a little with me in the trying of
the doctrine wch my ſelfe haue

here taught in my former Sermon
vpon the precedent verſe
and vpon this, thus farre. I
taught in that, the neceſsity of
dependance vpon preaching,
if we would be ſaued: I vrged
the ſeeking to enioy this means,
eſpecially on the Sabbath day,
though it were with ſom charge
or hazard. I haue perſwaded
(in this) diligence to Try the
doctrins wch are taught, & care
to be furniſhed with skill to that
end. Now it may bee, all are
not in theſe particulars of the
ſame opinion; perhaps, you
may heare that taught ſometime,
which is ſomewhat differing:
as, that other meanes
may ſerue without preaching,

that there needeth not be ſuch
labouring and ſeeking after it,
now and then may ſuffice; and
that it is not for ordinarie perſons,
to ſeeke to be ſo skilfull
and buſie, as to fall to the examining
of doctrines. It may be
(I ſay) ſuch things as theſe may
bee deliuered plauſibly, and
with ſome ſhew of truth. To
reſolue vs therefore herein, let
vs make vſe of our Rule: you
ſhall finde that this doctrine
which ſo preſſeth an attendance
vpon preaching, makes
moſt for mans humbling, moſt
for his comfort, moſt for his
reſtraint. 1 Moſt for his humbling.
For what can put a man
downe more then the binding

of him (whatſoeuer he be, noble,
wiſe, learned, and howſoeuer
elſe outwardly qualified)
to ſit him downe as a diſciple
in 
                  〈◊〉
                
               
                  •••
               rners forme? He ſhall
not think to worke out a path
to heauen by his owne induſtry:
but he muſt ſeeke ſauing
knowledge at the mouth of another,
and goe as hee is led
by anothers hand. This cuts
the very heart of mans naturall
pride, according as indeed
it is onely out of the hautineſſe
of their ſpirits, and their loathneſs
to ſtoope, and the good
opinion of their owne ſufficiency,
which maketh a great
many to gainſay this doctrine.
What is the reaſon that Paul
               
of old called it the fooliſhnes of
preaching1 Cor. 1 21? but becauſe men
in their ſeeming wiſdome ſcorned
it, and eſteemed it for little
better then euen a very ridiculous
and childiſh courſe.
Oh, if man by ſome courſe of
his owne inuenting, might be
permitted to ſeek out heauen,
it would pleaſe him a great
deale better: but, to require him
to giue attendance vpon a
Teacher, to ſit at the foot of a
poore Miniſter, and to heare
what he ſhall ſay, and to ſuffer
him to controule and checke
him in his courſes, and with
meekenes and ſilence yea euen
with thankfulnes to endure
it, what a very death is this?

what a baſe thing in the eyes
of fleſh and blood? you ſee
plainely this makes moſt for
a mans humbling: I am much
deceiued, if it doe not alſo
make moſt for his comfort.
Firſt, this I am ſure, that the
myſtery of Chriſt (the ground
of comfort) can neuer ſo work
vpon a mans affections any
way, as when it is effectually
diſcouered by a liuely voyce.
There is a certaine efficacy in
the voyce of man to put life
into the inward parts.Habet neſcio quid latentis energiae viua vox. Hier. But this
is not all: Here is the chiefe;
A mans comfort in Chriſt is
then ſuch as he may haue beſt
aſſurance of, when hee
can ſay, hee hath not therein

beene his owne caruer, but
the ſame hath beene applyed
to him by the hand of Gods
Miniſter; who is the ſteward
of the Lords houſe, to giue to
euery one his portion of meat
in ſeaſon. The faithfull Paſtor
in the congregation, is in
Chriſts ſteed2 Cor. 5. 21, & hath power
to bind and looſeMat. 18. 18. I ſay vnto
thee plainely, thou canſt neuer
take that true, ſound and ſolide
comfort in Chriſt, which is fit,
till thou haſt the authority of
Gods Miniſter to ſeale it vp
vnto thee. That which hee
putteth on thee, and applyeth
to thee, (thy heart being rightly
prepared before hand) that
ſame is it wherupon thou maiſt

reſt. Hee is that one man of
a thouſand, which muſt declare
thy righteouſneſſe vnto
thee, that God may haue mercie
on theeIob. 33. 23. 24.. Loth would I
bee to preiudice any mans or
or womans comfort. Let euery
one looke to himſelfe vp-what
ground he ſtandes: This
I am ſure, that he ſtandes vpon
the beſt and ſafeſt tearmes, who
can ſay touching his hope and
comfort in Chriſt Ieſus, This
I haue gotten by awaiting vppon
Gods ordinance; The
Miniſter who hath authority
from God, thus and thus hath
he ſpoken to my ſoule.
            Let vs now ſee in the third
place, whether this courſe bee

not alſo (as I ſaid) moſt for mans
reſtraint. What man is there
but if hee were left vnto himſelfe,
to take his owne choyce,
would not rather ſit ſtill warme
and quiet at home, and keepe
his money in his purſe for his
owne priuate occaſions, and
take his eaſe on the Sabbath
day, and ſatisfie himſelfe with
a reading Miniſter, then paine
his body, ſtraine his purſe, hazard
his peace, tye vp himſelfe
ſhorte from thoſe Sunday-delightes,
which the men of the
Times are accuſtomed to, and
all this for preachings ſake?
Certainely, there is more content
to the fleſh by the other
ſtill courſe, then by that kinde

of dependance vpon preaching
which I haue laboured to
perſwade. A man muſt reſolue
to cut himſelf ſhort in many
things, or elſe hee ſhall neuer
profit by it as is meet. I may
thus diſcouer the truth of this
Rule, in that other point alſo
touching Triall. How doth
this make to a mans humbling,
when he is not permitted to
truſt his owne firſt apprehenſions,
but is required (in a kind
of iealouſie ouer him ſelfe and
in the diſclayming of his owne
iudgement) to ſeeke a Rule
out of himſelfe, by which to
examine that which hee muſt
make vſe of for himſelfe? How
doth it againe adde to a mans

comfort? By this meanes hee
attaines to that ſweeteneſſe in
Religion, and to that vnderſtanding,
which without this
he ſhould neuer haue perceiued.
This will enable him to
ſay, Thy word is prooued to
be pure, & thy ſeruant loueth
itPſal. 119. 140. How (laſtly) doth this
curbe a man in his owne naturall
deſire? For whereas of
himſelfe he would gladly end
his taſte with the act of hearing,
and ſo betake himſelfe
to ſome freer courſe; this calls
him to an after-reckoning,
and bindes him to a ſecond
labour of recounting & viewing
all particulars; and making
diligent inquirie into

them for their certainty. And
thus haue I giuen an inſtance
or two for the application of
this Rule: and therein I end
this firſt part of my Text touching
the firſt vertue therein
required, which I called Diſcretion.
            The next now followeth,The ſecond Doctrine.
which is concerning conſtancy
(Keep that which is good).
The doctrine is, That that
which diligence of tryall
hath diſcouered to vs to bee
found, muſt with all faithfulnes
and perſeuerance be kept and
reteined to the end. The very
firſt view of the words will acquite
me from ſtrayning this
collection: Keepe that which

is good: Neuer leaue ſifting
of Doctrines till you haue
found the good: when you
haue found it, be ſure to preſerue
it; a ſhame to haue taken
ſuch a deale of paines for it, &
then to forſake it. The truth of
this point will bee the more
profitably diſcouered, if wee
ſhall be pleaſed to vnderſtand
and conſider, that there is a
three-fold keeping which may
very well be thought to bee
heere intended. 1 A keeping
in memory. 2 A keeping in affection.
3 A keeping in practice.
The firſt of theſe makes
way for the ſecond; the ſecond
for the third. Good muſt be remembred
that it may be loued:

and it muſt bee loued, that it
may bee practiced. Touching
keeping of good and holy
things in memory theſe Texts
are plaine. Hide my Commandements
within theePro. 2. 1, Keepe
them in the midſt of thy hartPro. 4. 21,
Take heed, keep thy ſoule diligently
that thou forget notDeut. 4. 9▪
               .
Theſe words ſhall bee in thy
heartDeut. 6. 6▪
               . Remember the words
which I ſaid vnto you (ſaid our
Sauiour)Ioh. 15. 20. Remember the
wordes which were ſpoken of
the ApoſtlesIude 17, Giue heede to
the things which wee haue
heard, leſt at any time wee
ſhould let them ſlipHeb. 2. 1. The memorie
is as it were the treaſury
of the ſoule: what more worthie

to bee laid vp in it, then
that wherewith the things of
the greateſt worth are not
meet to be comparedPro. 3. 14. Holy
doctrine is (as I may call it)
the food of the ſoule. It is the
portion of meat ſpoken of in
the GoſpellLuk. 12. 42. Now what good
will a mans meate doe him if he
voide it vp, through weakneſs
of ſtomack as faſt as it is eaten?
the body thereby can receiue
no nouriſhment. Elſe-where
that which is commended to vs
by preaching, is compared to
ſeedLuk. 8. 11. Now when the ſeed is
caſt into the ground, if the
birds do by & by pick it vp, or
the ſwine ſtrait way deuoure it
vp, Is there any hope of harueſt?

It is ſo in this. Be that
which we haue gotten by hearing
neuer ſo excellēt, if it tary
not with vs it cannot auaile vs.
It may bring a man to ſome
ſmell of Religion; neuer to any
truth or power of godlineſſe.
Well, as it muſt be kept
in memory, ſo in affection too;
my meaning is, a man muſt
perſiſt in the earneſt loue and
zealous profeſsion thereof.
There muſt be no declining
nor going back, no ſlaking of
that firſt egerneſs with which
hee ſeemed in the beginning
to embrace it. This is that holding
faſt cōmended by Chriſt
to the Church of Philadelphia
Reu. 3. 11, and the want hereof was

the blemiſh of Epheſus; it is
taxed in her by the tearmes of
loſing her firſt loueReu. 2. 4. There
may be an intertaining of good
things with ioy, which yet vaniſheth
like a morning clowde;
and as it commeth to nothing▪
ſo it is worth nothing. It is
good to loue alwaies earneſtly
in a good thingGal. 4. 18. When the
beginnings bee hot, and the
proceedings but warme, the
concluſion generally is colde,
and the end of ſuch is fearfulLuk. 11. 26.
The children of God muſt rather
encreaſe1 The. 4. 1 and grow2 Pet. 3. 18, &
go from ſtrength to ſtrengthPſa. 84. 7,
and ſhine more and morePro. 4. 18,
and follow hard toward the
markePhil. 3. 14. Then (thirdly)

there muſt be alſo a keeping
in practice. That good which
is found muſt be obeyed. This
is that keeping, to which
Chriſt promiſeth a bleſsingLuk. 11. 28,
which Saint Iames cōmendsIam. 1. 25,
& wch 
               Dauid aymeth at in that
affectionate ſpeech, Oh that
my waies were directed, that
I may keepe thy ſtatutesPſ. 119. 11.
There is no ſuch keeping here
meant, as that of the greedy
men of the world, in hoarding
vp their treaſure, euen vntill
the cankering and ruſting therof
Iam. 5. 3, be ready to witnes againſt
them, and as a fire to eate their
fleſh: but this is a keeping for
vſe. Such a keeping Dauid
ſpeakes of, I haue hid thy promiſe

               
                  〈1 page duplicate〉

in my heart, that I might
not ſinne againſt theePſ. 119. 11; he ſo
kept the knowledge of holy
things in his minde, that hee
might produce them into practice.
The truth is, if a man
doe hold faſt the truth of God
in his affection, he cannot but
ſhew forth the fruites of obedience
to it in his practice:
The abundance which is in his
heart, cannot but breake forth
into his outward man. This is
like that oyle in a mans right
hand which vttereth it ſelfePro. 27. 16.
It is as the wine, which will ſooner
breake the veſſels in which
it is, then it will want ventIob. 32. 19.
The ſweetneſſe which a man
findes and feeles in it, by giuing

it louing entertainement
in his heart, will ſo rauiſh him,
that he cannot but bewray the
contentment which hee findes
therein, by his outward carriage.
His whole life and courſe
will proclaime and teſtifie the
zealous affection of his ſoule.
Can a man loue the truth in his
heart, and not tender the credit
thereof? And is it poſsible
to bring more credit to it,
then to be bold and reſolute
in obeying it? to be careleſſe
of credit, peace, profit, and
what ſoeuer els by nature man
affects, ſo that hee may walke
therein? It is in vaine for a man
to profeſſe to loue religion in
his heart, if hee diſclaime the

rule, and authority, and power
of it in his life. As, if a man
ſhould proteſt he loues me, but
when I come to try him hee
will doe nothing for mee;
will I beleeue his proteſtations?
So then, this may ſatisfie
vs for this point; If I would
keep life in the graces of Gods
ſpirit which I haue receiued,
I muſt honour prophecying:
My honouring of prophecying
muſt be tempered with trying
that which is deliuered by
it: when by tryall I haue found
out that which I am ſure is
good, I muſt reſolue vpon
keeping it, I muſt keepe it in
memory, and ſtriue not to forget
it. I muſt keep it in affection,

and labour not to loſe my
firſt loue to it. I muſt keepe it
in practice, that all my whole
life & carriage may adorne it.
To labour to finde out good,
and when it is found, not to
remember it is ridiculous: to
remember it and yet to make
no account of it, is vaine: to
ſay I make account of it, and
yet doe not practice it, is abſurd:
I ſtriue to remember it,
I labour to effect it, I make
conſcience to obey it, this is
excellent.
            Think you,The Vſe. whether this be
not a very neceſſarie point to
be remembred to vs, conſidering
what ill Keepers generally
we bee in matters of this nature.

For touching the firſt
kinde of keeping, which is memory;
beſides that naturall debility
which is in vs in things
of this kinde, how iuſtly are we
chargeable with a kinde of
willing forgetfulneſſe? It is not
our purpoſe nor our care to
remember, wee are euen very
well content to loſe theſe
particulars. Wee who can
whine and fret for other loſſes,
and be angry with our ſelues,
and ſay, what a beaſt was I to
forget this, and not to remember
that; are yet neuer troubled,
though multitudes of
good points of doctrine run
through vs, as through a pipe,
or fall from vs, as water from

a Swans back, leauing behind
within vs no impreſsion. Doe
but ſpeak ſoothly (I pray you)
betwixt God and your ſoules,
and ſay, when did you ſolemnly
in prayer lament your forgetfulneſſe,
and entreat the
Lord to pardon it? This ſheweth
we are guilty of a kinde of
affected forgetfulneſs. I would
this were all our failing (though
this be bad enough) but, beholde
yet more abominations;
Alas how looſe are wee
in our affections to holy things?
There is (I confeſſe) a kinde
of ſodain heate, which ariſeth
in ſome, ſomewhat violent
at the firſt, like the fluſhings in
the face of a man who is inwardly

diſtempered. Oh, what
will not they doe? they march
as furiouſly as Iehu, in their
firſt onſet; They will heare,
they will read, they will ſanctifie
the Sabbath, they will reforme
their families, they will
ſweare no more, &c. but (woe
is me) what is more ordinarie
then to ſee euery day many
ſuch paſſe away, as the riſing
of RiuersIob 6. 15? their great heate
is ſoone aſſwaged, they are
quickly wearie of that ſeruice,
which they ſeemed to vndertake
with a great deale of
feruency. How full are our
dayes, of ſuch vpon whom
when a man lookes hee may
with a kinde of mournefull indignation

ſay, Are all their
great ſhews come to this? Nay,
let the beſt profeſſors (if they
be wiſe) conſider themſelues
touching this, and compare
together their preſent courſe
with their firſt beginnings, and
ſee whether they haue not let
goe a great deale of their firſt
holde, and are euen come the
very next ſtep to a Laodicean
temper. I knowe nothing
wherein a wiſe Chriſtian hath
more cauſe to feare himſelfe
then this, that his loue is not
ſo earneſt, nor his zeale ſo feruent
as it hath been. This ſame
decaying in affection, it is like
a conſumption, it ſteales vpon
a man, and is farre growne vpon

him many times, yea euen
wel-neer to an incurable pitch
before it bee perceiued. Fearing
it, will be a meanes to preuent
it. We liue in a cooling
Climate, and wee ſhall finde it
as hard to keepe this heat in
vs, as it was to maintain Dauids
naturall heate when hee was
old1 Kin. 1. 1. I haue ſhewed our defect
in the two firſt kindes of
keeping: let vs ſee what may
be found in vs touching the
third, Keeping in practice.
And here (me ſeemeth) I am
ſodainely ſtriken with aſtoniſhment,
and knowe not what to
ſay: not for lack of matter, but
for lack of skill to drawe, into
few words, ſuch a world of matter,

as this particularity doth
afford. Here a man might fill
euen a roule of a booke within
and withoutEzek. 2. 10, with accuſations,
cenſures, complaints,
threatnings, againſt all degrees,
ages, conditions, ſexes.
Somewhat happely we remember,
ſomewhat we ſeeme to eſteme
and to profeſſe: but what
is our practice? I ſpeake not
now touching thoſe, which are
at a kinde of enmity with all
religion, and care not though
they be noted and knowne to
bee of none: but let vs looke
to our ſelues, who would bee
thought to haue a regarde to
goodneſſe, and ſome reſpect to
the beſt things, who come to

heare, & will needs be thought
to loue that courſe, to approue
it, to vpholde it, and ſee how
poore and barren is our practice.
Alas, that we ſhould not
onely giue cauſe to papiſts to
ſpeak euill of our Religion, &
Faith, through our barrenneſs,
but (which is worſe) ſhould open
the mouthes of profane
wretches amongſt our ſelues,
to tax profeſsion and hearing,
as the nurſery of licentiouſnes.
The truth is, the liues & courſes
of many, who yet will come
and ſit, as Gods people vſeth
to comeEzek. 33 31, are very ſcandalous.
For my own part, though I wil
not ioyne with thoſe, who vrge
this to the diſreputatiō of al that

are affected well, yet I will nether
ſeek to excuſe their euils,
but ſay rather with the Apoſtle
They ſhall beare their iudgement
whoſoeuer they beeGal. 5. 10. I
haue almoſt done: I will now
draw to an exhortation, and I
beſeech you that I may preuail
with you for this Keeping duty.
It is ſuch a keeping, as by
which your ſelues ſhall bee
kept vnto ſaluation. I perſwade
entertainment for ſuch
a gueſt, at whoſe entrance into
thy ſoule, thou mayſt ſay, as
Chriſt did at his comming to
Zacheus his houſe, This day is
ſaluation come to theeLuk. 19 9. It
ſhall be to thy ſoule, as the preſence
of the Arke of Obededoms
               
houſe2 Sam. 7 11. Loſe not al your
labour (I pray you) in repairing
hither; you cannot beſtow
an houre worſe, then by
going to a Sermon and get
nothing. Hearken what wee
ſay: we may ſay with an humble
boldneſſe, we are the Embaſſadours
of Chriſt, wee are
the Meſſengers of the Lord of
hoſts, we ſpeake wordes vnto
you, by which you and yours
may be ſaued: Yet, heare vs as
men ſubiect to infirmities, hear
vs with diſcretion: Bring vs to
the touch. Oh, that you would
once doe vs that honour, to
Try our doctrine. If you finde
any thing to be good (as no
doubt you ſhall) what will you

do to it? looke vpon it awhile,
and (as it were) play with it, as
little children with a new-bought
toy which within awhile
they caſt away? God forbid.
God will not be ſo anſwered.
Labour to locke it vp in
your memories: reſolue with
Dauid, I will not forget thy
wordesPſa. 119 16; pray the God of
peace, to write his law in your
hearts, ſtriue to loue it, and
that will be a good helpe to remember
it. Can a maid forget
her ornament and a bride her
attireIer. 2. 32? Her loue to it, makes
her not to forget it. I neuer
heard (ſaith the Orator) of any
man ſo old, as that hee forgot
where he laid his treaſure.

When you remember it, ſtriue
to worke your affections to
embrace it more and more. Be
conſtant to the death, and you
ſhall receiue the crowne of
lifeReu. 2. 10▪
               . Reſolue touching that
which you haue found to bee
true, & ſo accordingly haue begun
to profeſſe, as that worthy
Thebane ſouldier did touching
his buckler, I will either defend
thee, or die vpon thee.
Say to the Truth when thou
haſt once met with it, as Ruth
did to Naomi; The Lord do ſo
to me and more alſo, if ought
but death departe thee and
meeRuth 1. 17. And when you haue
thus faſtned your affections to
it, then let mee ſay to you, as

               Iehoſaphat did to his Officers
when hee ſent them on the circuit,
Be of courage and doe
it, and the Lord ſhall bee with
that good2 Chr. 19 11. Let your vertue
and your knowledge go together
2 pet. 1. 5▪
               . Thus do, & the God of
peace ſhall be with you. Eſpecially
remember to bee practitioners
of good in your particular
places, Magiſtrates in
yours, Miniſters in yours, Maſters
of families in yours. In
your ranks & ſtandings make
your care of obedience to appeare.
This is that courſe
which ſhall bring you peace
and comfort at the laſt. God
will bee good vnto thoſe that
are good: ſuch as turne aſide

by their crooked waies, them
ſhall the Lord leade, with the
workers of iniquitypſa. 125 4. 5. Woe
