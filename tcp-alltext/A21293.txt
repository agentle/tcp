               TO THE RYGHT HONORABLE THOMAS LORDE CRVMwell Lorde priuye ſeale, Thomas Elyot knyght wyſſheth longe lyfe in honour.
            
               
                  HE GYVETH TVVYSE THAT 
               Bis dat, qui clto dat. gyueth quyckely (ſayth Senek). the griete, whiche I had tor your lordeſhypes dyſeaſe, with the deſyre that ye mought lyue longe, without ſyckeneſſe, cauſed ſuche ſpede in buyldinge the Caſtell of helth, that therin lacked ſome parte of perfection, but yet the promptneſſe in gyuynge that thinge, whiche I thought neceſſarye, to declare myne affection, I doubt not, was no laſſe eſtemed of your good lordeſhyp, than afore is reherſed. Notwithſtanding whan I had eftſones peruſed that lytle fortreſſe, and founde here and there ſome thinge that lacked, I toke my penne in the ſtede of a truell, & amended the faultes, and added ſomwhat more, where I thought it conuenient: And yet perthaunce ſome thinges mought happen to eſcape, which were as nedefull to be corrected: myne attendaunce on the parlyament, I beynge a membre of the lower houſe, withdrawinge frome me leyſur conuenient, to fynde in this warke all the faultes, which mought be amended. May it now lyke your good lordeſhype to take in good part,

               tſones the caſtell, which I alredy haue gyuen you, but my good will and diligence in amen dynge or repayryuge the ſame, which is alſo printed in a moche better lettre, conſyderynge that I no laſſe do behold you continuelly with myne eye of remembrance, than they which at dynuar and ſouper do dayly loke on you, the cauſe I wyll not repete for ſuſpicion of flaterye. Frendeſhype (as men ſaye) ſhoulde be requyted, but yet craue I none other thinge, but onely equall beneuolence, and fayth without any ſuſpicion: whereunto actuall demonſtracion is ſo moche requyſite, that without it they both, ſeme to be drowned, ſens amonge vs that be mortall, thinges are moſt iudged by outwarde tokens. And yet alſo in them men be ſometyme deceyued, Hypocriſy hauing in this world ſo great a preemynence: but in amitie is one rule, which ſeldome fayleth. He that lyueth moderately, dothe loue alwaye faythfully: for ouer him affections and paſſions haue left authoritie: and he that ſtandeth iuſte in the myddell, ſtandeth moſte ſurely. Alſo in the worlde there is no more foly, than to cheſe frendes of them, whiche do folow fortune, lyke as ſwyne do folow the mayden, which beareth on her hed a payle full of mylke. And yf the payle fal, or happen to be emptye, they will folowe no lengar. The moderate perſonne, where bothe authoritie and vertue be in his frende equall, bycauſe that vertue was the onely cauſe of his loue, that remaynynge, his mynde is in ſuche wyſe therevnto ioyned, that althoughe

authoritie happen to flyp, yet that loue & vertue maye neuer be ſeuered. I haue ſpoken of frendſhyp perchaūce more than nedeth, but who wil not wyſhe (yf it mought happen) to haue ſuch a treaſor, as neither the mountaynes of Ethiope, nor the ryuers of Inde do conteyne in them, to be therto compared. Callimachus an auncient porte ſayth, Puyſſance is dredeful: Richeſſe is honorable: but loue for ſurete is moſt incōparable. Who perceyueth herein more thā your good lordeſhyp, whiche beſydes the aboundaunt knowlege of hiſtories & naturall wyt, alſo concernyng this mater in your owne ſondry experiences, I dare ſaye without flattery, are equall to any noble man lyuyng. Yet this my longe tale is not ſuperfluous, which is tolde not to teach you, but only to renew your lordſhips remembrance, which is not alway preſent, ſpecially where the brayn is choked with worldly maters of wayghty importance. In ſuch as I am, hauynge lytle and lytle to do, remembraunce ſtandeth more at libertie, and therfore we maye more often thynke on that, whiche we haue both herde and ſene, and in cheſinge frendes, be the more circumſpect. But leſte I ſhall make the name of frendeſhyp tedyouſe, by often reherſall, I now conclude, that I leue this lytle warke a monument of the longe continued affectiō by me borne toward your lordeſhyp, & a perpetual wytneſſe, that I haue deſerued, ſo moche of your fauoure, as in mutuall frendeſhyppe is of rayſon requyred: whych maye be as eaſyly payed, as it

               
                  〈◊〉
                graunted, yf in place, where it ought to be ſhewed, ye doo not forget it, In the meane tyme I ſhall praye to God to adde to youre good fortune and helthe, continuaunce, with his grace and fauour, wherin onely is moſt perfyt ſuretie.

               ¶ Of Quantitie. Cap. 1.
               
                  THE Quantitie of meate muſte be proporcioned after the ſubſtaunce and qualite therof, and according to the complexion of hym that eateth. Fyrſt, it ought to be remembred, that meates hote and moiſte whyche are qualities of the bloudde, are ſoone, tourned into bloudde, and therfore moche nouryſheth the body. Some meates do nouriſhe but lyttell, hauynge lytteil conformitie with bloudde in their qualities. Of them, whiche do nouriſhe, ſome are more groſſe, ſome lyghter in digeſtyon. The groſſe meate ingendreth groſſe bloude, but where it is well concocte in the ſtomake, and well digeſted, it maketh the fleſſhe more fyrme, and the officiall members more ſtronge, thanne fyne meates. Wherfore of men, which vſe moch labor or exerciſe, alſo of them, whiche haue very chorike ſtomackes here in Englande, groſſe meates may be eaten in a great quantite: and in a cholerike ſtomake biefe is better dygeſted than a chykens legge, foraſmoche as in a hotte ſtomacke. fyne meates be ſhortly aduſte and corrupted.
               Contrarywiſe in a colde or fleumatike ſtomacke groſſe meate abydeth longe vndigeſted, and maketh putrifyed matter: lyght meates therfore be to ſuche a ſtomacke more apte and conuenyent.

The temperate bodye is beſte nouryſſhed with a lyttell quantitie of groſſe meates: but of temperate meates in ſubſtaunce and qualytie, they maye ſafely eate a good quantitie. Foreſeene alway, that they eate withoute gourmandyſe, or leaue with ſomme appetyte. And here it wolde be remembred, that the cholerycke ſtomake doth not deſyre ſoo moche as he maye dygeſt: the melancholye ſtomacke maye nat dygeſte ſoo moche as he deſyreth. for colde maketh appetite, but naturall heate concocteth or boyleth. Not withſtandynge vnnaturall or ſupernaturall heate diſtroyeth appetite, and corrupteth dygeſtyon, as it appereth in feuers. More ouer, fruytes and herbes, ſpecyally rawe, wolde be eaten in a ſmall quantitie, all thoughe the perſone be very cholerycke, foraſmoche as they do ingender thynne watrye bloudde, apte to receyue putryfaction, whyche all thoughe it be not ſhortelye perceyued of theym that vſe it, at lengthe they feele it by ſondrye dyſeaſes, whyche are longe in commynge, and ſhortely ſleeth, or be hardely eſcaped. Fynally, exceſſe of meates is to be abhorred. For as it is ſayde in the booke callyd Eccleſiaſticus, Eccl. 37. In moche meate ſhall be ſyckeneſſe, and inordynate appetite ſhall approche vnto coler. Semblablye the quantitie of drynke wolde be moderated, that it excede not, nor be equalle vnto the quantitie of meate, ſpecially wine, whiche moderately taken, aydeth nature, and comforteth her, and as the ſayde authour of Eccleſtaſticus

ſayth, Wyne is a reioycing to the ſoule and bodye. And Theognes ſaythe in Galenes Eccl. 31. warke, A large draught of wyne is yll. A moderate Calen. de

               ¶ Of qualitie of meates. Cap. 2.
               QValitie is in the complexion, that is to ſay, it is the ſtate therof, as Hotte or cold, moiſt or dry. Alſo ſome meates be in wynter cold in acte, and in vertue hotte. And it wolde be conſydered, that euerye complexyon temperate and vntemperate, is conſerued in his ſtate, by that whiche is lyke therto in fourme and degree. But that whyche excedeth moche in dyſtemperaunce, by that whyche is contrarye to hym in fourme or qualitie, but lyke in degree moderately vſed. By fourme is vnderſtand groſſeneſſe, fyneneſſe, thickeneſſe, or thynneſſe, by degree, as the fyrſte, the ſeconde, the thyrde, the fourthe, in heate, colde, moyſture, or drythe.
            
            
               Of Custome. Capit. 3.
               CVſtome in fedynge is not to be contemned, or lyttell regarded: for thoſe meates, to the whiche a man hathe bene of longe tyme accuſtomed, though they be not of ſubſtance commendable, Hippocra tes aphoriſmo. 2. yet do they ſomtyme laſſe harme than better meates, whervnto a mā is not vſed. Alſo the meates and drynkes, whiche do moch delyte him

that eateth, are to be preferred before that, which is better, but more vnſauerye. But yf the cuſtome Galenus. be ſoo pernyciouſe, that hit needes muſte be lefte, thanne wolde it be withdrawen by lyttelle and lyttelle in tyme of healthe, and not of ſyckeneſſe. For yf it ſhoulde be withdrawen in tyme of ſyckeneſſe, Nature ſhulde ſuſteyne treble detriment, fyrſte by the grief induced by ſykneſſe, ſeconde by receyuynge of medicines, thirdly by forbearyng the thyng, wherin ſhe deliteth.

               TO kepe the body in good temper, to theym, whoſe naturall complexion is moyſt, ought to be gyuen meates, that be moyſte in vertue or power. Contrarywiſe to theym, whoſe naturalle complexion is drye, oughte to be gyuen meates drye in vertue or power. The bodyes vntemperate, ſuche meates or drynkes are to be gyuen, which be in power cōtrary to the diſtemperance, but the degrees are alwaye to be conſydered, as welle of the temperaunce of the bodye, as of the meates. For where the meates doo moche excede in degree the temperature of the bodye, they annoye the body in cauſyng diſtemperance, As hot wynes, pepper, garlycke, onyons, and ſalte, be noyfull to theym, whyche be cholerike, bycauſe they be in the higheſt degree of heate and drithe, aboue the iuſte temperaunce of mannes body in

that complexion. And yet be they oftentimes hol ſome to them, whiche be fleumatike. Contrarye wyſe, colde water, colde herbes, and cold fruites moderately vſed, beholſom to cholerike bodies, by puttynge a way the heate, excedynge the naturall temperature: and to them, whyche be fleumatike, they be vnholſome, and doo brynge into them diſtemperance of colde and moyſte.

and do ingender yll humours, and be ofte tymes the cauſe of putrified feuers, if they be moch and continually eaten. Not withſtādyng vnto them, which haue abundance of coler, they be ſomtyme conueniēt, to repreſſe the flame, which procedeth of coler.

Therfore if they be rype, they do leeſt harme of any fruites, or almoſte none. Dry figges and old, are more hot and moyſt than newe gathered, but beinge moche eaten, they make yll bloudde and iuyce, and as ſome do ſuppoſe, do ingender lyce, and alſo anoyeth the lyuer and the ſplene, if they be inflamed, but hauyng the power to attenuate or make humours currant, they make the bodye ſoluble, and do clenſe the raynes. Alſo being eaten afore diner with gynger or pepper, or powder of tyme, or peny royal, they profyt moch to them, whiche haue oppilations or harde congeled matter

                  BEfore that auarice cauſed matchauntes to fetche out of the eaſte and ſouthe partes of the world, the traffyke of ſpyce and ſondry drouges, to content the vnſaciablenes of wanton appetites, Colewortes for the vertues ſuppoſed to be in theym, were of ſuche eſtimation, that they were iudged to be a ſufficient medicine ageynſte all diſeaſes, as it may appere in the voke of wyſe Cato, wherin he writeth of huſbandry. But now I wyll no more remember, than ſhalbe required, in that whyche ſhall be vſed as meate, and nat pure medicine. The iuyce thereof hath vertue to

purge: the holle leaues beinge halfe ſodden, and the water poured out, and they being put efteſones into hot water, and ſodden vntyl they be tender, ſo eaten, they do bynde the bealy. Some doo ſuppoſe, if they be eaten rawe with vyneger, before meate, it ſhal preſerue the ſtomake from ſurfettynge, and the heed from drunkenneſſe: all be it moche vſynge of them dulleth the ſyght, except the eies be very moyſte. Fynally the iuyce that it maketh in the bodye is not ſo commendable, as that whiche is ingendred of lettyſe. It is hote in the fyrſte degree, and drie in the ſeconde.

               Of breade. Cap. xi.
               BReadde of fyne floure of wheate, hauynge no leuyn, is flowe of digeſtion and makethe flymy humours, but it nouryſheth moche: if it be leuyned, it digeſteth ſooner: breade hauyng moch branne, fylleth the bealy with excrementes, and nouryſheth lyttell or nothyng, but ſhortly deſcendeth from the ſtomake: The meane betwene both ſufficiently leuyned, well moulded and moderatly baken is the moſte holſome to euerye age. the greateſt loues do noryſhe moſt faſt, for as moch as the fyre hathe not exhauſted the moyſture of them. Hotte breadde, moche eaten, maketh fulnes

and thyrſte, and ſlowely paſſeth. Barley breadde clenſeth the body, and doth not nouryſhe ſo moch as wheate, and maketh colder iuyce in the body.

               BEfe of Englande to Engliſſhemen, whiche are in helth, bryngeth ſtronge nouryſhinge, but it maketh groſſe bloude, and ingendreth melancoly: but being of yonge oxen, not excedynge the age of foure yeres, to them, whiche haue colerike ſtomakes, it is more conuenient, than chikens, and other lyke fyne meates.
               
                  Swynes fleſhe.
                  Aboue all kyndes of fleſhe in nouryſhyng the body, Galene moſt commendeth porke, not being of an olde ſwyne, and that it be well digeſted of hym that eateth it. For it maketh beſte iuyce, it is moſte conuenient for yonge perſons, and them whiche haue ſuſteyned moche labour, & therwith ar fatigate, and become weake. yong pigges are not cōmended before that they be one month old, for they do brede ſuperfluous humours.
               
               
                  Lambe,

                  Mutton,
                  Galene dothe not commende it, not withſtanding experience proueth here in this realme, that De alimē. lib. 3. yf it be yonge, it is a ryght temperate meate, and

maketh good iuyce: and therfore it is vſed more than any other meate, in all diſeaſes. And yet it is not lyke good in all places, nor the ſhepe, whiche beareth fyneſt wolle, is not the ſweteſt in eatynge, nor the moſte tender. But I haue founde in ſome countrays mutton, whiche in whytenes, tenderneſſe, and ſweteneſſe of the fleſhe, mought be wel nygh compared to kydde, and in digeſtion haue proued as holſome.
               
               
                  Kydde and veale,
                  Of Galene is commended nexte vnto porke, but ſom men do ſuppoſe, that in helth and ſiknes they be moch better than porke, the iuyce of them both being more pure. And here it is to be noted, that of all beaſtes, which be drye of their nature, the yongeſt be mooſte holſome: of them that are moyſte, the eldeſt are leſt hurtfull.

                  Maketh groſſe bloudde, it drieth and ſtoppeth, but yet it prouoketh a man to pyſſe. Cony maketh better and more pure nouriſhment, and is ſooner Hippo. de ratione ui ctus lib. 2. cap. 19. Plin. 28. digeſted than hare. It is well proued, that there is noo meate more holſome, or that more cleane, firmely, and temperatly noryſſheth thā tabettes.
               
               
                  Dere redde and falowe.
                  Hippocrates affyrmeth the fleſhe of hartes and hyndes, to be of yll iuyce, hard of digeſtion and drie, but yet it moueth vrine. Of falowe dere, he nor any other olde writer dothe ſpeake of, as I remember. I ſuppoſe, bycauſe there be not in all the world ſo many as be in England, where they

conſume a good parte of the beſte paſture in the realme, and are in nothynge profytable, ſauynge that of the ſkynnes of them is made better lether, than is of calues: the huntynge of them beinge not ſo pleaſant, as the huntynge of other venery or vermyne, the fleſhe moche more vnholſome and vnpleaſant, than of a redde dere, ingendring melancoly, and makyng many feareful dreames, and diſpoſeth the bodye to a feuer, if it be moche eaten: not withſtandyng the fatte therof, as ſom lerned men haue ſuppoſed) is better to be digeſted, than the leane.
               
               
                  ¶ Of Byrdes.
                  THe fleſhe of al byrdes, is moche lighter than the fleſhe of beſtes in compariſon, moſt ſpecially of thoſe foules, whiche truſte moſt to their wynges, and do brede in hygh countreys.

It is commodious to the breaſte and ſtomake. Hennes in wynter, are almooſte equall vnto the capon, but they do not make ſo ſtronge nouriſhement. Auycen ſayth, if they be roſted in the bealy of a kydde or lambe, they wyll be the better. Chickens in ſommer, ſpecially if they be cockrelles, are very conuement for a weake ſtomak, and nouryſheth a lytel. The fleſhe of a cocke is hard of digeſtion, but the brothe, wherin it is boyled,

                  ueth fore. But nowe to the qualities of water, after the ſentence of auncient philoſophers and phiſitions, The rayne water, after the opinion of the moſt men, if it be receyued pure and cleane, is moſt ſubtyl and penetratiue of any other waters: the next is that, whiche iſſueth out of a ſpring in the eaſt, and paſſeth ſwiftly among great ſtones or rockes: The thirde is of a cleane ryuer, whyche renneth on greate harde ſtones or pebles. There be dyuerſe meanes to trie out, whiche is the beſte water. For that whiche is lighteſt in poyſe or weight is beſt. alſo that, wherof cometh leeſt ſkymme or frothe, whan it doth boyle. Alſo that, which wyll ſooneſt be hot. Moreouer deape linnen clothes into ſondry

waters, and after lay them to dry, & that whiche is ſoneſt dry, the water wherin it was deaped, is moſt ſubtyll. After a great ſurfete, colde water drunken, is a general remedy. Hippocrates affirmeth, y• in ſharp and feruent diſeaſes, none other De ratiōe

And Galen wyl not, that chyldren ſhuld be let from drynking of water: but that whan they fele them ſelfes very hote, after meales, and do deſyre to drynk water, ſpecially of a cleane fountayne, they ſhuld be ſuffred. Alſo Hippocrates ſayth, In ſuch ſyknes, where as thou feareſt, leſt the heed ſhuld be vehemently greued, or the mynde periſhed, there muſt thou giue eyther water, or white wine alayd with moche water. Not withſtādyng there be in water cauſes of dyuers diſeaſes, as of ſwellyng of the ſplene, and the lyuer, it alſo flytteth & ſwymmeth, and it is longe or it perceth, in as moche as it is colde &

                  lowe in decoction, it lowſeth not the bely, nor prouoketh vrine. Alſo in this it is vyciouſe, that of his proper nature, it maketh none ordure. Fynally, alway reſpect muſte be hadde to the perſone, that drynketh it. for to yong men, and them, that be hotte of complexion, it dothe laſſe harme, and ſomtyme it profyteth. but to them that at feble, olde, fleumatike, or melancoly, it is nat cōuenyent.
            
            
               ¶ Of wyne. Cap. xix.
               
                  PLato, the wyſeſt of all phyloſophers, dothe affirme, that wyne moderately drunke, nouryſheth

and comforteth, as well all the bodye, as the ſpirites of man. And therfore god dyd ordeyn it for mankynde, as a remedy ageynſt the incommodities of age: that therby they ſhulde ſeme to retourne vnto youth, and forgette heuynes. Vndoubtedly wyne heateth and moyſteth the bodye, whyche qualities chiefely conſetueth Nature.
               And Galene of all wynes, cōmendeth that, whiche is yelow and clere, ſaying, That it is the hotteſt, and whyte wyne leſte hotte. And the coloure meane betwene both, of ſemblable temperature. The yelowe wyne, whiche is the proper colour of very hotte wynes, to olde men dothe brynge theſe cōmodities, Fyrſt it heateth all their members: alſo it purgeth by vrine, the watrye ſubſtance of the bloud. Moreouer, the wynes, whiche be pale or yelowe, and full of ſubſtance, they do increaſe bloude, and nouriſhe the bodye: but for the more part olde men haue nede of ſuche wynes, whiche do prouoke vrine: foraſmoche as in them doo abounde watry excrementes or ſuperfluities. And they whiche do tary longe in the bealy, be not apt for aged men. Blacke or deepe redde wynes and thicke, do bind and congele that whiche they doo fynde in the body, and although ſome of theym do not long abyde in the bealy, yet they moue not vrine, but rather withdraweth: but yet they doo harme to olde men, foraſmoche as they do ſtoppe the cundites of the ſplene, the lyuer, and the raynes. Alſo groſſe wines be beſt for them, which deſire to be fat, but it maketh opilations: olde wyne

and clere, is better for them, that be fleumatike.
               Galene alſo prohibiteth chylderne to drynke any wyne, foraſmoche as they be of a hote and moyſt Lib. 1. de

More ouer he wolde, that yonge men ſhulde drinke lyttel wine, for it ſhall make them prone to fury and to lecherye: and that parte of the ſoule, whiche is callyd rationall, it ſhall make troublous and dulle: not withſtandyng, yet it is ſomtime profitable to mitigate or expell ordure, made of coler or melancoly. Alſo it profyteth agaynſt drythe, whiche hapneth in the ſubſtance of the body, either by to moche labour, or by the proper temperature of age: for wyne moyſteth and nouriſheth that, which is to drie, alſo mitigateth and diſſolueth the ſharpnes of coler, & purgeth it alſo by vrine & ſweate: Finally (as Theognes ſaith) Moch drinkyng of wyne is yll, but moderate drynkynge of wyne is not onely not yll, but alſo commodious and profytable. Whiche ſentence is confyrmed by Ieſus Syr

Wherfore to conclude this chapiter, There is neyther meate nor drynke, in the vſe wherof ought to be a more diſcrete moderation, than in wyne, conſyderinge that deing good and drunke in due tyme and meaſure, it not only conſerueth naturall and radicall moyſture, whereby lyfe indureth, but alſo it helpeth the princypall

members, whiche belong to digeſtion, to do their office: On the other parte, being yll or corrupt, or taken out of order and meaſure, it dothe contrary to all the premiſſes. beſydes that it tranſformeth a man or woman, makynge them beaſtly. More of the qualities of wyne, ſhall be touched hereafter in the order of diete.
            
            
               ¶ Of Mylke. Cap. xx.
               
                  MIlke is compact of thre ſubſtances, creame, whey, & cruddes. The moſte excellent milke is of a woman. The mylke of a cow is thyckeſt, the mylke of a camell is moſt ſubtyl, the mylke of a goote is betwene cowe milke, and camell mylk. Ewes mylke is betweene cowe mylke and aſſes mylke. Alſo the mylk of beaſtes, fedyng in large paſtures, and out of fennes and marſhes, is better than of them, whiche be fedde in lytell cloſes, or in watry groundes. In ſpringe tyme mylke is moſt ſubtyll, and milke of yong beaſtes, is holſomer, than of olde. To chyldren, olde men, and to them, which be oppreſſed with melancoly, or haue the fleſhe conſumed with a feuer ethike, mylke is conuenient. And generally to all them, which do not fele the mylk riſe in their ſtomakes, after that they haue eaten it: and in thoſe perſons, it dothe eaſily pourge that whiche is in the bealye ſuperfluous. And afterwarde it entreth into the vaynes, and bryngeth good nouriſhement. Who ſoo euer hath an appetite to eate or drynke mylke, to

the entent that it ſhal not ariſe or abraid in the ſtomake, let him put into a veſſell, out of the whiche he wyl receyue it, a few leaues of myntes, ſugar, or pure hony. And into that veſſell cauſe the beſt to be mylked, and ſoo drynke it warme from the vdder: or els let him do as Paulus Egineta teacheth, that is to ſay, boyle firſt the milke with an eaſy fire, & ſethe it after with a hotter fire, & ſkym it clene, and with a ſpunge deaped in cold water, take that cleane away, which wolde be burned to the veſſell, than put to the mylke, ſalt and ſugar, & ſtere it often. More ouer mylke taken to purge melancoly, wold be drunke in the morning abundantly Oribaſius de confectione ciborū li. 3. newe mylked, as is before written. And he that drynketh, ſhuld abſteyn from meate, and exerciſe, vntyll the mylke be digeſted, and haue ſom what purged the bealy. For with labour it becometh ſoure: & therfore it requyreth reſt & watch or to walke very ſoftly. Finally, where men & womē be vſed from their childhode, for the more part, to mylk, and do eate none or lyttell other meate, but mylke and butter, they appere to be of good complexion and facion of body, & not ſo moche vexed with ſycknes, as they whiche drinke wine or ale: not withſtandyng moch vſe of milke in men ſanguine or colerike, doth ingender the ſtone.
            
            
               ¶ Of ale, biere, cyder, and whay.
               
                  I Can neyther here nor rede, that ale is made & vſed for a cōmon drynke in any other countray

than England, Scotlād, Ireland, & Poyle. The latyn worde Cereuitia, is indifferent as welle to ale as to biere, and the only difference betwene them is, that biere hath hoppes ſodden in it, ale ought to haue none. If the corne be good, the water holſome and cleane, and the ale or biere well and perfytclye brewed and clenſed, and by the ſpace of ſyx dayes or more, ſettled and defecate, it muſt nedes be a neceſſary & conuenieut drynk, as well in ſyknes as in helth: conſyderinge that batleye corne, wherof it is made, is commended, and vſed in medicine, in all partis of the world, & accompted to be of a ſyngular efficacy, in reducynge the body into good temper, ſpecially which is in a diſtemperature of heate. For what auncient phiſition is there, that in his workes commendeth not ptyſane, whiche is none other than pure barley, brayed in a morter, and ſodden in water? The ſame thynge is ſmalle and cleane ale or b
                     •
                  ere, ſauynge that perchaunce, the drienge of the malte, is cauſe of more dryth to be in the ale, than in ptiſane. And the hoppes in biere maketh it colder in operation. But to ſay as I thynke, I ſuppoſe, y• neither ale nor biere is to be compared to wyne, conſideringe, that in them do lacke the heate and moyſture which is in wine. For that being moderately vſed, is moſt lyke to the natural heate and moyſture of mans bodye. And alſo the lykour of ale & bere beinge more groſſe, do ingender more groſſe vapours, and corrupt humors, than wine doth, beinge drunke in lyke exceſſe of quantitie.
               
                  
¶ And one thyng is to be noted, which was lately well marked of a man of excellent lerning, being vexed witd the ſicknes of the ſtone, That in them, whiche do alway vſe to drynke ale or biere, the ſtone and grauell ingendred in them is white of colour: And in them, whiche do vſe to drynke wine for the more parte, the ſtones and grauelle, whiche be ingendred in them, be redde of colour. Not withſtandynge commonly the colour of the ſtone foloweth the humour, whiche dothe moſte abound in the pacient. As coler maketh the grauell more redde, fleme maketh it more white. alſo ſome men do ſuppoſe, that red grauell is ingendred in the raynes, white grauell in the bladder. Moreouer, who ſo euer vſeth ingurgitation of ale or biere, his breath ſhalbe more lothſom, than the breathes of them, whiche do take the exceſſe of wyne: for the wyne by the reaſon of his heate, is ſoner digeſted, and dothe leaue behynde hym fewer dregges. As for Cyder, may nat be good in any condicion, conſyderyng (as I ſayd) that all fruites do ingender yll humours, and doo coole to moch naturall heate: but to them, which haue abundance of red coler, moderatly vſed, it ſomewhat profyteth in mitigation of exceſſiue heate. But who that wyll diligently marke in the countreys, where ſyder is vſed for a common drynke, the men and women haue the colour of their vyſage pallyd, and the ſkynne of their vyſage ryuelled, although that they be yonge. Whay, if it be lefte of the butter, beinge well ordred, and not

drunke, vntyll it haue a thycke curde of mylke ouer it, like to a hatte, is a right temperate drinke, for as moche as by the vnctuoſitie of the butter, wherof the whay retayneth ſom portiō, it is both moyſt and nouriſhyng, and clenſeth the breaſte: and by the ſubtylnes of it ſelfe, it deſcendeth ſone from the ſtomake, and is ſhortly digeſted. Alſo by reaſon of the affinitie, whiche it hath with mylk, it is conuertible into bloude and fleſhe, ſpecially in thoſe perſons, whiche doo inhabyte the northe partes, in whom naturall heate is conglutinate, and therfore is of more puiſſance and vertue in the offyce of concoction. Alſo cuſtome from childhode doth eleuate the power of meates and drinkes in their diſpoſition, not withſtandynge that the foure humours, ſanguine, coler, fleume, and melancoly, muſt alſo be conſydered, as it ſhal appere in dyuers places hereafter.
            
            
               ¶ Of hony. Cap. xxii.
               
                  HOnye as well in meate as in drynke, is of incomparable efficacy, for it not onely clenſeth, altereth, and noriſheth, but alſo it long time preſerueth that vncorrupted, which is put in into it. In ſo moche as Pliny ſayth, Suche is the nature of hony, that it ſuffreth not the bodies to putrifie. And he affirmeth, that he dyd ſe an Hippocentaure Plin. li. 22. (which is a beaſte halfe man, half horſe) brought in honye to Claudius the emperour out of Egypte, to Rome. And he telleth alſo of oone

Pollio Romulus, who was aboue a hundred yeres olde, of whome Auguſtus the emperour demanded, by what meanes he lyued ſo longe, and retayned ſtyll the vygour or lyuelynes of body & mynd, Pollio anſwered, y• he did it inwarde with meade (which is drinke made with hony & water) outward with oyle. Whiche ſayeng agreeth with the ſentence of Democritus, the greate philoſopher: who being demanded, how a man mought lyue longe in helthe, he aunſwered, If he wette hym within with honye, without with oyle. The ſame philoſopher, whan he was a hundred yeres olde and nyne, prolonged his lyfe certayn dayes with the euaporation of honye, as Ariſtoxenus writeth. Of this excellent matter, moſte wonderfully wrought and gathered by the lyttell bee, as wel of the pure dewe of heuen, as of the moſt ſubtyl humor of ſwete & vertuous herbes & floures, be made lykors cōmodious to mākynd, as mead, metheglyn, and oxymell. Meade, whiche is made with one parte of hony, and foure tymes ſo moch of pure water, and boyled vntyll no ſkym do remayne, is moche comended of Galene, drunke in Galen. de tuend. ſanita. li. 4. ſommer, for preſeruynge of helth. The ſame author alway commendeth the vſynge of hony, eyther rawe eaten with fyne breadde, ſomewhat leuened, or ſodden, and receyued as drinke. Alſoo meade perfectly made, clenſeth the breſt and lunges, cauſeth a man to ſpytte eaſily, and to pyſſe abundantly, and purgeth the bely moderatly. Metheglyn, whiche is moſte vſed in wales, by reaſon

of hotte herbes boyled with hony, is hotter than meade, and more comforteth a colde ſtomake, if it be perfectly made, and not new or very ſtale. Oximell is, where to one part of vineger is put double ſo moche of hony, foure tymes as moche of water, and that being boiled vnto the third part, and cleane ſkymmed with a fether, is vſed to be taken, where in the ſtomacke is moche fleume or matter vndigeſted, ſo that it be nat redde choler. Loke the vſe therof in Alexandro Tralliano. Many other good qualities of honye, I omytte to write of, vntyll ſome other occaſion ſhall happen, to remember them partycularly, where they ſhall ſeme to be profitable.
            
            
               ¶Sugar. Cap. xxiii.
               OF Sugar, I do fynd none auncient author of grekes or latynes, to write by name, but onely Paulus Aegineta, who ſayth in this wiſe, after that he hath treated of hony. Moreouer ſugar, whiche they calle hony, that is brought to vs from Arabia, called Felix, is not ſo ſweete as oure hony, but is equall in vertue, and doth not anoy the ſtomake, nor cauſeth thyrſt. Theſe be the wordes of Paulus. It is nowe in dayely experience, that Sugar is a thynge verye temperate and nouryſſhynge, and where there is choler in the ſtomacke, or that the ſtomacke abhorreth honye, it maye be vſed for honye in all thynges, wherin hony is required to be.

               IN the conſyderation of tyme, for takynge of meates and drynkes, it is to be remēbred, that that in winter meates ought to be taken in great abundance, and of a more groſſe ſubſtance than in ſommer, foraſmoch as the exteriour ayre, whiche compaſſeth the bodye being colde, cauſeth the heate to withdrawe into the inner partes, where beinge incloſed, and contract togyther in the ſtomake and entrayles, it is of more force to boyle and digeſte that, whiche is receyued into it. Alſo meates roſted, ar than better than ſodden, & fleſh and fyſhe powdred, is than better than in ſomer. Herbes be not than commendable, ſpecially raw, neither fruites, excepte quynces roſted or baked: drynke ſhuld be than taken in a lyttell quantitie. More ouer wynes ſhall nede no water or very lytell, and that to coleryke perſones: redde wynes, and they, whiche be thycke and ſwete, may be thā moſte ſurely taken of them, whiche haue none opilations, or the ſtone.

               The ſprynge tyme dothe participate the fyrſte parte with wynter, the later parte with ſommer.

Wherfore if the fyrſt parte be colde, than ſhal the Hippocrates de natura humana. diete be accordyng to wynter. If the ende be hot, than ſhall the diete be of ſommer. If both partis be temperate, thā ſhuld there be alſo a temperāce in diete: alway conſyderinge, that fleume yet remaineth, and bloude than increaſeth. And meate wolde be laſſe in quantitie thanne in wynter, and drynke ſomewhat more. Sprynge tyme begynneth the .viii. day of February, and cōtinueth vntyll the .viii. day of May.
               In Sommer the inward heate is but lytel, and Gal. com. in aphor. 18. li. 1. the ſtomake doth not digeſt ſo ſtrongly nor quikly, as in wynter. Wherfore in that ſeaſon, eating often, and a lyttell at ones, is moſte conueniente. And Damaſcenus ſayth, that faſtyng in ſommer drieth the bodye, maketh the colour ſalowe, ingendreth Hipocrates de humoribus. melancolye, and hurteth the ſyght. alſo boyled meate, breade ſteped in white brothe, with ſodden lettyſe, or cykorie, ar than good to be vſed. alſo varietie in meates, but not at one meale, potages made with colde herbes, drynke in more abundance, wyne alayde with water, to hotte complexions moche, to colde natures laſſe.

Theſe thinges knowen, if they eate ſtrong meates, giue them not one kynde of meate, but dyuers, that the noueltie of the meate may helpe, that they maye go more eaſily to the ſtoole. For if any haue an vnreaſonable appetite, he is ſooner recouered, if he be pourged by a boyle or impoſtume commen forthe and broken, before that the meate be corrupted: and after that let hym eate fyne meates, and beinge ones hole, retourne by lyttell and lyttell to his olde cuſtome.

In that wherby Nature ſhoulde be nouryſſhed, in a hole and temperate body, thinges muſt be taken, whiche are like to the mannes nature in qualitie and degree. As where one hath his bodye in a good temper, thynges of the ſame temperaunce dothe nouryſhe hym. But where he is out of temper, in heate, colde, moyſture, or drythe, temperate meates or drynkes, nothynge do profyte hym. For beinge out of the meane and perfytte temperature, nature requyreth to be therto reduced by contraries, remembrynge not oonely, that contraries are remedye vnto their contraries, but alſo in euery contrary, conſideration be hadde of the proporcion in quantitie.

But concernynge the generall vſage of countreis, and admitting the bodies to be in perfite ſtate of helthe, I ſuppoſe, that in Englande, yong men, vntil they come to the age of .xl. yeres, may wel eate thre meales in one day, as at brekefaſt, dyner, and ſupper, ſo that betwene brekefaſt, and diner, be the ſpace of foure houres at the leſt, betwene diner and ſupper .vi. houres, & the brekefaſt laſſe than the dyner, and the dyner moderate, that is to ſay, laſſe than ſacietie or fulneſſe of bealy, and the drinke ther vnto meſurable, according to the dryneſſe or moyſtnes of the meate. For moche abundance of drinke at meale, drowneth the meate eaten, and not only letteth conuenient concoction

               ¶ Of Order in receyuynge of meate and drynke. Capit. xxix.
               HErbes as wel ſodden as vnſodden, alſo frutes, whiche do mollifie and louſe the bealye, ought to be eaten before any other meate, excepte that ſometyme for the repreſſynge of fumoſities, ryſyng in the heed by moche drinkynge of wyne, rawe lettyſe, or a colde appul, or the iuyce of oren ges or lymons maye be taken after meales in a lyttell quantitie. Moreouer all brothes, mylke, rere egges, and meates, whiche are purpoſely taken to make the bely ſoluble, wold be fyrſt eaten.

All fruites and other meates, that are ſtiptike or byndynge, wolde be eaten laſt of all other. Fruites cōfectionate ſpecially with hony at not to be eaten with other meates. But here it is to be diligently noted, that where the ſtomake is colericke and ſtronge, groſſe meates wolde be fyrſte eaten: where the ſtomake is colde or weake, there wolde fine meates be firſt eaten. for in a hot ſtomak fine meates ar bourned, whyle the groſſe meate is digeſtyng. Contrary wiſe in a colde ſtomake, the litell heate is ſuffocate with groſſe meate, and the fine meate left raw, for lacke of concoction, where if the fine meate be firſt taken moderately, it ſtyreth vp and comforteth naturall heate, and maketh it more able to concoct groſſe meates, if they be eaten afterward: ſo that it be but in ſmal quā
                  tite. not withſtāding, as I late affirmed, one ma ner of meate is moſt ſure to euery cōplexion. forſene that it be alway moſt cōmonly in conformitie of qualites, with the perſon that eateth. More ouer take hede, that ſlypper meates be not firſte eaten, leſt it draw with it to haſtily other meates, or they be digeſted, nor that ſtiptik or reſtrainyng meates be taken at the beginnynge, as quinces, peares, and medlars, leſt they may let other meates, that they deſcende not into the bottom of the ſtomake, where they ſhuld be digeſted, not withſtandynge the confection made with the iuyce of quinces called Dacytonites, taken .ii. houres afore diner or ſupper, is cōmended of Galene, & other, for reſtoring appetite, & making good cōcoction.

Alſo concernyng drinke at meales, it wold not be afore that ſomwhat were eaten. And at the begin nyng, the drink wold be ſtrongeſt, and ſo toward the end more ſmall, if it be ale or biere and if it be wyne, more and more alayde with water. And after the better opinion of phyſitions, the drynke wolde rather be myxte with the meate by ſondrye lyttell draughtes, than with one greate draughte at thende of the meale, for the myxture tempreth well the meate without anoyāce: a great draught with moch drynke, drowneth the meate, rebuketh naturall heate, that than worketh in concoction, and with his weight dryueth downe the meate to haſtily. Note wines & ſwete, or confectioned with ſpices, or very ſtronge ale or bere, are not conuenient at meales, for the meate is by theym rather corrupted, than digeſted, and they make hote and ſtynkynge vapours aſcend vp to the braynes, all be it if the ſtomake be very wyndy, or ſo cold and feble, that it can not concocte ſuche a quantitie of meat, as is required to the ſufficient nouriſh mēt of the body of hym that eateth, or hath eaten raw herbes or fruites, wherby he feleth ſome annoyance, than may he drynke laſte incontinent after his meale a lyttell quantitie of ſecke, or good aqua vite in ſmall ale: but if he haue moche coler in his ſtomake, or a heed full of vapours, it were moche better, that he dyd neither drynke the one, nor the other, but rather eate a lyttell colyander ſede prepared, or a piece of a quynce roſted, or in marmelade, and after reſt, to amende the lacke of

nature with ſlepe, moderate exerciſe, and plaſters prouided for comfortynge of the ſtomacke. And here wyl I leaue to write any more of the diete in eatynge and drinkyng, ſauyng that I wold, that the reders ſhuld haue in remembrance theſe two counſailes. Fyrſt, that to a hole man, to preciſe a rule is not conuenient in diet: and that the diſeaſes, whiche do happen by to moche abſtinence, ar wars to be cured, than they which come by repletion. And as Cornelius Celſus ſaith, A man that Cor. Cel. lib. 1. ca. 1. is hole and well at eaſe, & is at his lybertie, ought not to bynde him ſelf to rules, or nede a phiſition: but yet where the ſtomacke is feeble, as is of the Idē cap. 2. more part of citeſyns, and wel nygh all they that be ſtudyous in lernynge or weyghtye affayres, there ought to be more circumſpection, that the meate may be ſuche, as that eyther in qualitie or quantitie, nature being but feble, be not rebuked, or to moche oppreſſed.
            
            
               ¶ Of ſleape and watche. Cap. xxx.
               THe commoditie of moderate ſlepe appereth by this, that naturall heate, whiche is occupied about the matter, wherof procedeth noriſhment, is comforted in the places of digeſtion, and ſo digeſtiō is made better, or more perfit by ſlepe, the body fatter, the mynde more quiete and clere, the humours temperate: as by moche watche all thynges happen contrarye. The moderation of ſlepe muſt be meaſured by helth and ſyckenes, by

age, by tyme, by emptyneſſe or fulneſſe of the body, & by naturall complexions. Fyrſt to a hole mā hauing no debilitie of nature, and digeſting perfitly the meate that he eateth, a lytel ſlepe is ſufficient: but to them, which haue weake ſtomakis, & do digeſt ſlowly, it requireth that ſleape be moch lengar. ſemblable tēperance is required in youth and age, wynter and ſommer. The body beinge full of yll humors, very lytell ſlepe is ſufficient, except the humors be crude or raw, for thā is ſlepe neceſſary, whiche digeſteth theym better than labour. Semblably, where the body is long empty, by longe ſykneſſe or abſtinence, ſlepe comforteth nature, as well in the principall members, as in all the other. Alſo regarde muſt be had to the com plexion, for they that ar hot, & do eate lyttell, & digeſt quickly, a lytell ſlepe ſerueth, ſpecially to colerike perſons, for in them moche ſlepe augmenteth heate, more than is neceſſary, wherby hot fumes and inflamations ar often ingendred, & ſom tyme the naturall coler is aduſte or putrified, as experience teacheth. Fleumatike perſons are naturally inclined to ſlepe: and bicauſe they ingender moch humors, they require more ſleape than ſanguine or colerike. Perſones hauyng naturall melancoly, not proceding of coler aduſte, do require very moch ſlepe, which in them comforteth the powers animall, vitall, and natural, which ye may finde writen in the tables preceding. Slepe wold be taken not immediatly after meales, & be fore that the meate is deſcended from the mouthe

of the ſtomake. For therby is ingendred peines & noyſe in the bely, & digeſtiō corrupted, & the ſlepe by yl vapors aſccding, made vnquiet & troubloꝰ. Moreouer immoderate ſlepe maketh the body apt vnto palſeis, apoplexis, falling ſiknes, reumes, & impoſtumes, alſo it maketh the wittes dulle, and the body ſlow & vnapt to honeſt exerciſe. semblably imoderate watch drieth to moch the body, and doth debilitate the powers animall, letteth digeſtion, & maketh the body apt to conſūptiōs, wher fore in theſe .ii. thiges, aſwel as al other, a diligēt tēperance is to be vſed. the moderation is beſt cō
                  iected (for it is hard perfitly to know it) by the ſen ſible lightnes of al the body, ſpecially of the brain the browes and the eies, the paſſage downe of the meat from the ſtomake, the wyll to make vrine, & to go to the ſtoole. Contrarywiſe, heuynes in the body & eies, and ſauour of the meate before eaten ſignifieth that the ſlepe was not ſufficient. They that ar hole muſt ſlepe firſte on the right ſyde, bycauſe the meate may approche to the lyuer, which is to the ſtomake, as fyre vnder the pot, & by hym is digeſted. To them, which haue feble digeſtiō, it is good to ſlepe proſtrate on their bealies, or to haue their bare hand on their ſtomakes. Lienge vpright on the backe is to be vtterly abhorred.
            
            
               ¶ The commoditie of exerciſe, and the tyme whan it ſhuld be vſed. Cap. xxxi.
               EVery meuynge is not an exerciſe, but only ye which is vehement, thend wherof is alteration

of the breath or wynde of a man. Of exerciſe do procede two commodities, euacuation of excrementes, and alſo good habite of the body, for Exerciſe being a vehement motion, therof nedes muſt enſue hardnes of the members, wherby labour ſhall the leſſe greue, & the bodye be the more ſtronge to labour. alſo therof commeth augmentation of heate, wherby hapneth the more attraction of thynges to be digeſted, alſo more quicke alteration, and better nouryſhynge. More ouer, that all and ſyngular partes of the body, be therwith ſomwhat humected, wherby it hapneth, that thynges harde be mollified, moyſte thynges are extenuate, and the poores of the bodye are more opened. And by the vyolence of the breathe or wynde, the poores are clenſed, and the fylthe in the bodye naturally expelled. This thynge is ſoo neceſſary to the preſeruation of helth, that without it, no man may be longe without ſyckeneſſe, Cor. Cel. lib. 1. whiche is affirmed by Cornelius Celſus, ſayeng, that ſluggyſhenes dulleth the body, labour doth ſtrength it, the firſte bringeth the incommodities of age ſhortely, the laſt maketh a man long tyme luſty. Not withſtandynge in exerciſe ought to be foure thinges dilygentely conſydered, that is to ſay, the tyme, the thynges precedynge, the qualytie and the quantitie of exerciſe.
               ¶ Fyrſte as concerning the tyme conuenient for exerciſe, that it be not whā there is in the ſtomake or bowels, greatte quantitie of meate not ſufficiently digeſted, or of humours crude or rawe, leſte

therby peryll moughte inſue by conueyaunce of them into al the members, before thoſe meates or humours be concoct or boyled ſufficiently. Galen Galen. de ruen. ſani. lib. 2. ſayth, that the tyme moſte conuenient for exerciſe is, whan bothe the firſte and ſeconde digeſtion is complete, as wel in the ſtomake, as in the vaines, & that the tyme approcheth to eate eftſones. For if ye do exerciſe ſoner or later, ye ſhall eyther fyll the body with crude humours, or elles augment yelowe coler. The knowlege of this tyme is perceiued by the colour of the vrine, for that whiche reſembleth vnto clere water, betokenethe, that thiuyce, whiche cometh from the ſtomake, is crude in the vaynes: that which is well coloured, not to high or baſe, betokeneth, that the ſecond dygeſtiō is nowe perfite: where the colour is very high or redde, it ſygnyfyeth, that the concoction is more than ſufficient. Wherfore whan the vrine appereth in a temperate color, not red nor pale, but as it were gilt, thā ſhuld exerciſe haue his begining.
            
            
               ¶ Of fricaſies or rubbynges precedyng exerciſe. Cap. xxxii.
               AS touching thinges preceding exerciſe, for as moch as it is to be fered, leſt by vehemēt Galenus. Paulus. Oribaſius Aerius. exerciſe any of the excremētes of the bely or bladder, ſhuld haſtily be receiued into the habit of the body, by the violence of hete, kendlyd by exerciſe: alſo leſt ſom thyng, whiche is hole, be by heuynes of excrementes, or vyolent mocion, broken or pullyd

oute of his place, or that the excrementes, by violence of the breth, ſhuld ſtop the pores or cundites of the body, it ſhalbe neceſſary lytell and lytell, by chaſyng the body, firſt to mollify the partes conſolidate, & to extenuate or make thinne the humours, and to louſe and open the poores, and than ſhal enſue to hym that exerciſeth, no peryll of obſtruction or rupture. And to bringe that to paſſe, it ſhall be expedient, after that the bodye is clenſed, to rubbe the bodye with a courſe lynnen cloth, firſt ſoftly & eaſily, & after to increaſe more and more, to a harde and ſwift rubbing, vntyl the fleſhe do ſwelle, and be ſomwhat ruddy, and that not only down right, but alſo ouerth wart & roūd. Som do vſe fricaſyes in this forme. In the mornyng, after that they haue ben at the ſtoole, with their ſhirte ſleue or bare hande, if their fleſſhe be tender, they do firſt ſoftly, & afterward faſter, rub their breaſte, and ſydes downewarde, and ouerthwarte, not touching their ſtomake or bealy, and after cauſe their ſeruant ſemblably to rubbe ouerthwart their ſhulders and backe, begynnynge at the neckebone, and nat touchynge the raynes of their backe, excepte they do fele there moche colde and wynde, and afterward their legges from the knees to the ancle: laſt their armes, frome the clbowe to the handewreſte. And in this fourme of fricaſy, I my ſelfe haue founden an excellent cō
                  moditie. Olde men, or they, whiche be very dry in their bodies, if they put to ſome ſweete oyles, as Yrinum, Nardinum, Cham
                        •
                     melinum, or other lyke, myrt

with a lyttell ſwete oyle of roſes, I ſuppoſe they do wel. I wyl not here ſpeke of oyntmentes vſed in olde tyme amonge the Romayns and Grekes, in fricaſies or rubbynges. For I ſuppoſe, y• they were neuer here vſed. and in the ſaid places, they be alſo lefte, onles it be in palſeys, or apoplexies, or againſt the rigour, whiche hapneth infeuers, only I wyll remember the ſaying of Hipocrates, Fricaſye hath power to louſe, to bynd, to increaſe fleſhe, and to minyſhe it. For harde fricaſies doo bynde or conſolydate, ſofte rubbynge dothe lowſe or mollifie, moch doth miniſhe fleſhe, meane rubbyng doth augment or increaſe it. He that wylle knowe more abundantly hereof, let hym rede the boke of Galen of the preſeruation of helth, callid in latyn De tuenda ſanitate, tranſlated mooſt truely & eloquently, out of Greke into latin, by doctour Linacre, late phiſition of moſt worthy memory to our ſouerayne lorde kynge Henry the eight. The ſame mattier is written more brefely of Paulus Aegineta, Oribaſius, Aetius, and ſome other late writers, but vnto Galene not to be compared.
            
            
               ¶ The diuerſities of exerciſes. Cap. xxxiii.
               THe qualitie of exerciſe is the diuerſitie therof, foraſmoche as therin be many differēces in mouynge, and alſo ſome exerciſe moueth more one part of the body, ſome an other. In difference of mouynge, ſome is ſlow or ſofte, ſome is ſwifte

or faſte: ſome is ſtronge or violent, ſome be mixt with ſtrength & ſwiftneſſe. Stronge or violente exerciſes be theſe, deluynge (ſpecially in toughe clay and heuy, bearynge or ſuſteynynge of heuye burdeyns, clymmyng or walkyng againſt a ſtipe vpright hyll: holdyng a rope, and clymmyng vp therby, hangyng by the handes on any thing, aboue a mans reache, that his fete touche not the grounde: ſtandyng and holdyng vp, or ſpreding the armes, with the handes faſt cloſed, & abiding ſo a longe tyme. Alſo to holde the armes ſtedfaſt, cauſyng an other man, to aſſay, to pull them out, and not withſtandynge he kepeth his arme ſtedfaſt, inforcing ther vnto the ſinewes and muſcules. Wraſtlyng alſo with the armes and legges, if the perſons be equall in ſtrength, it dothe exerciſe the one and the other: if the one be ſtronger, than is it to the weaker a more violent exerciſe.
               Al theſe kyndes of exerciſes, and other like them, do augment ſtrength, and therfore they ſerue only for yonge men, which be inclined, or be apte to the warres. Swifte exerciſe without violence is, runnyng, playeng with weapons, teniſe, or throwyng of the ball, trotting a ſpace of grounde forward and backward, going on the toes, and holdyng vp the handes. Alſo ſtirring vp and downe his armes, without plummettes. Vehemēt exerciſe is compounde of violent exerciſe and ſwifte, whan they ar ioyned togither at one tyme, as danſyng of galyardes, throwyng of the balle, & runnyng after it. footeball play may be in the nūber

therof, throwyng of the longe dart, and continuing it many tymes, runnyng in harneys, & other lyke. The moderate exerciſe is longe walking or going a iourneye. The partes of the bodye haue ſondry exerciſes appropried vnto them, as rounning and going is the moſt proper for the leggis. Mouyng of the armes vp & downe, or ſtretching them out, & playeng with weapons, ſerueth moſt for the armes and ſhulders, ſtouping and riſyng often tyme, or liftyng great weightes, takyng vp plummettes or other lyke poyſes on the endes of ſtaues, & in lyke wiſe, liftyng vp in euery hande a ſpeare or moryſpike by the endes, ſpecially croſſing the handes, and to lay them downe ageyn in their places, theſe do exerciſe the backe & loynes. Of the bulke & lunges the proper exerciſe is meuing of the breath in ſyngyng or crieng. The entrayles, which be vnderneth the myddreſte, be exerciſed by blowyng, eyther by conſtraint, or playeng on ſhaulmes, or ſackbottes, or other lyke inſtrumentes, which do require moch wynde. The muſcules at beſt exerciſed with holdyng the breth in, a longe tyme, ſo that he, whiche dothe exerciſe, hath well digeſted his meate, and is not troubled with moche wynde in his bodye. Fynallye lowde Celſus. 1. readynge, counterfayte battayle, tenyſe, or throwyng the ball, runnyng, walkynge, adde to ſhotyng, whiche in myn opinyon excede al the other, do exerciſe the bodye commodiouſely. Alway remember, that the ende of violent exerciſe, is difficultie in fetching of the breth. Of moderate exerciſe,

alteration of breath onely, or the beginninge of ſweate. More ouer in wynter, runnynge, and wraſtlyng is conuenient. In ſommer wraſtlynge alytell, but not rūning. In very cold wether, moche walking, in hote wether, reſt is more expedient. They which ſeme to haue moiſt bodies, & liue in idelnes, they haue nede of violēt exerciſe. They which ar lean and colerike, muſt walk ſoftly, and exerciſe them ſelfes very temperatly. The plummettes, callid of Galen Alteres, whiche are nowe moch vſed with gret men, being of equal weight, & according to the ſtrength of him that exerciſeth, are verye good to be vſed faſtynge, a litell before breakefaſt or dyner, holdinge in euery hande one plūmet, and lyfting them on high, and bringing them downe with moche violence, and ſo he may make the exerciſe violent, or moderate, after the poyſe of the plummettes, heuyer or lyghter, and with moche or lyttell labouryng with them.
            
            
               ¶ Of Gestation, that is to ſay, where one is caryed, and is of an other thynge meued, and not of hymſelfe. Cap. xxxiiii.
               THere is alſo an nother kynd of exerciſe, whiche is called Geſtation, and is mixt with mo Paulus Egineta. Aerius. uyng and reſt. For as moche as the body, ſyttyng or lyenge, ſemeth to reſt, and not withſtandyng it is meued by that, which beareth it, as lienge in a bedde, hangyng by cordes or chaynes, or in a cradell, ſytting in a chaire, whiche is caried on mens

ſhulders with ſlaues, as was the vſe of the auncient Romaynes, or ſyttinge in a boote or barge, whiche is rowed, rydyng on a horſe, whiche ambleth very eaſily, or gothe a very ſofte pace. The bed, cradel, and chaire caried, ſerueth for them, y• ar in long & continual ſiknes, or be lately recouered of a feuer. Alſo them, whiche haue the franſy or letharge, or haue a lyghte terciane feuer, or a cotidiane. This exerciſe ſwetely aſſwageth troubles of the mynde, and prouoketh ſlepe, as it appereth in chylderne, whiche are rocked. Alſo it is conuenient for them, whiche haue the palſey, the ſtone, or the gowte. Geſtation in a charyot or wagon hath in it a ſhaking of the body, but ſom vehement, and ſome more ſofte. the ſofte ſerueth in diſeaſes of the heade, and where any matter runneth downe into the ſtomake and entrayles. But the vehement ſhakynge is to be vſed in the griefes of the breaſt and ſtomake. Alſo in ſwelling of the body and legges in dropſies, palſeys, mygrimes, and ſcotomies, whych is an imagination of darkenes, beinge retourned, at the ende of his iourney, he muſte ſytte vp, and be eaſily moued. I haue knowen, ſaythe Aetius, many perſones in ſuche wiſe cured without any other helpe. Nauigation or rowyng nigh to the lande, in a calme water, is expedient for them that haue dropſies, lepries, palſeyes, called of the vulgare people, takynges, and franſies. To be caryed on a roughe water, it is a violent exerciſe, and induceth ſondrye affections of the mynde, ſommtyme feare,

ſometyme hope, nowe cowarde harte, nowe hardyneſſe, one whyle pleaſure, an other whyle dyſpleaſute. Theſe exerciſes, if they be wel tempred, they may put out of the body, all longe durynge ſyckeneſſes. For that whiche is myxte with reſte and meuyng, if any thyng els may, it moſt excellently cauſeth the body to be well nouriſhed. Celſus doth prohibite geſtation, where the body feeleth peyne, and in the begynnynge of feuers, but Celſus. 2. whan they ceaſſe, he aloweth it. Rydynge moderately, and without grefe, it doth corroborate the ſpirite and body aboue other exerciſes, ſpeciallye the ſtomacke, it clenſeth the ſences, and maketh them more quycke: albeit to the breſte, it is verye noyfull. It ought to be remembred, that as well this, as all other kyndes of exerciſe, wold be vſed in a hole countraye, & where the ayre is pure and vncorrupted. Foreſene, that he that woll exerciſe, do go firſt to the ſtoole, for the cauſes reherſed in the laſte chapiter.
            
            
               ¶ Of vociferation. Cap. xxxv.
               THe chief exerciſe of the breſt & inſtrumentes of the voyce is vociferation, whiche is ſyngynge, redyng, or crienge, wherof is the propertie, that it purgeth naturall heate, and maketh it alſo ſubtyll and ſtable, and maketh the members of the body ſubſtancial and ſtronge, reſiſting diſeaſes. This exerciſe wolde be vſed of perſones ſhort winded, and them, which can nat fetch their

brethe, but holdyng their necke ſtreight vpright. Alſo of them, whoſe fleſhe is conſumed, ſpecially about the breſte and ſhulders. Alſo whiche haue had apoſtumes broken in their breſtes: moreouer of them that are hoorſe by to moch moiſture. and to them, which haue quarteyn feuers, it is conueniente, it louſeth the humour, that ſtycketh in the breſt, and drieth vp the moyſtnes of the ſtomake, which properly the courſe of the quarten is wont to bring with hym, it alſo profiteth them, whiche haue feble ſtomakes, or do vomite continually, or do breake vp ſowrenes out of the ſtomacke. it is good alſo for griefes of the heed. He that intendeth to attempte this exerciſe, after that he hathe ben at the ſtoole, and ſoftly rubbed the lower partes, and waſhed his handes. Let him ſpeake with as baſe a voyce as he can, and walkynge, begyn to ſynge lowder & lowder, but ſtyl in a baſe voice, and to take no hede of ſweete tunes or armonye. For that nothyng doth profite vnto helthe of the body. but to inforce him ſelfe to ſynge great, for therby moch aire drawen in by fetching of breth, thruſteth forth the breaſt & ſtomake, and openeth and inlargeth the poores. By high crieng & loude redyng are expelled ſuperfluous humors. Therfore men and women, hauing their bodies feble, and their fleſſhe louſe, and not firme, muſt reade oftentimes loude, and in a baſe voyce, extendyng out the wynd pipe, & other paſſages of the brethe. But not withſtādyng this exerciſe is not vſed alway, and of all perſons. For they, in whome is abundance

of humours corrupted, or be moch diſeaſed with cruditie in the ſtomacke and vaynes, thoſe do I counſayle, to abſteyn from the exerciſe of the voice, left moch corrupted iuyce or vapors, may therby be into all the body diſtributed. And here I conclude to ſpeake of exerciſe, whiche of them, that deſyre to

                     REPLECION IS A ſuperfluous abundaunce of humours in the body: and that is in two maner of wyſe, that is to ſay in quantitie, and in qualitie.

               ¶ Of Abſtinence. Cap. iii.
               ABſtinence is a forbearynge to receyue any meate or drynke. For if it be but in parte, it is than callyd rather temperance than abſtinēce. It ought to be vſed onely after replecion, as the proper remedye therfore. And than if it be moderate, it conſumeth ſuperfluities, & in conſuminge them, it clarifieth the humours, maketh the body Celſ. li. 2. Hipoc. apho. li. 7. fayre coloured, and not onely kepeth out ſicknes, but alſo where ſycknes is entred, nothynge more helpeth, if it be vſed in ſeaſon.

Fyrſt in the mete before eatē, if it be moch in exceſſe or very groſſe, or not moch excedinge, or lyght of digeſtion, and accordinge therto, wolde abſtinence more or laſſe be proporcioned.

As touching tyme, it muſt be remembred, that in wynter and ſpring tyme, the ſtomakes be naturally very hot, & ſlepe is longe, & therfore in that tyme meates wolde be more abundant, & all though moche be eaten, it wyll be ſon
                     ••
                   digeſted. Wherfore abſtinence wold not be thā ſo moch as in ſommer, albeit to abſteyn moch in ſommer, except it be after replecion, Damaſcene ſaith, it drieth Damaſcenus apho. the body, it maketh the colour ſalowe, it ingē
                  dreth melancoly, and hurteth the ſight. Moreouer cuſtome may not be forgoten. for they, which are vſed from childhode, to eate ſondry meales in the day, wold rather be reduced to fewer meales, & litell meate, than to be cōpelled to abſteyn vtterly, to the intent, yt nature, which is made by cuſtom, be not rebuked, & the power digeſtiue therby debilitate. And note wel, that by to moche abſtinence,

the moyſture of the body is withdrawen and cō
                  ſequently the body drieth, and waxeth leane: naturall heate, by withdrawyng of moyſture, is to moche incended, and nat fyndynge humoure to warke in, tourneth his vyolence to the radycall or ſubſtanciall moyſture of the body, and exhauſtynge that humour, bringeth the body into a cō
                  ſumption. Wherfore Hipocrates ſaythe, that to ſcarſe and exquiſite an order in meate and drink, Aph. li. 2. is for the more patte more dangerous than that, whiche is more abundant. Contrary wyſe moderation in abſtinence▪ accordyng to the ſayde conſyderations, is to helth a ſure bulwarke.
            
            
               ¶ Of Vomite. Cap. iiii.
               THe meate or drynke ſuperfluous, or corrupted in the ſtomak is beſt expelled by vomite, if it be not very greuous to hym, whiche is diſeaſed. Alſo the moderate vſe of it, pourgeth fleume, A

Moreouer, it amedeth the affectes of the raines, the bladder, and the fundement. It alſo helpeth agaynſt lepries, cankers, goutes, dropſies, & alſo dyuers ſyckeneſſes procedyng of the ſtomacke. For if any grefe hapneth of the heade, vomite is than vncommodious. It is better in wynter, thā in ſommer. Alſo good for them, which are replete or very colerike▪ if they haue not welle digeſted. but it is yll for them that be leane, or haue weake

ſtomakes. And therfore where one feeleth bytter vapours, riſyng out of his ſtomacke, with griefe and weighty

                  es, in the ouer partes of his body, let him runne forth with to this remedy. It is alſo good for him that is hart burned, and hath moche ſpittel, or his ſtomake wambleth, and for him that remeueth into ſondry places. yet I counſa

                  le ſaith Celſus, hym that wyll be in helth, and wold Celſ. li. 1. not be to ſoone aged, that he vſe not this dayely. And I my ſelfe haue knowen men, whiche dayly vſyng it, haue brought therby their ſtomakes into ſuche cuſtome, that what ſo euer they dyd eate, they coude not longe retayn it, wherby they ſhortene their liues. Wherfore it wold not be vſid, but onely where great ſurfet, or abundance of fleume do require it. He that wyll vomite after meate, let hym drynke ſondry drinkes myxte togyther, and laſt of all, warme water: or if that be to eaſy, let hym myxt therwith ſalt or hony. If he wyll vomite faſtyng, let hym drinke water and hony ſodden togither, or Iſope with it, or eate of a radyſhe roote, and drynke warme water vpon it. alſo water, wherin radyſhe is boyled, and afterward prouoke hym ſelfe to it. Them, that wyll haue more violent purgations, I remytte to phiſitions lerned. But yet I do eftſones warne them, that ther in they be circumſpect, and do not moche vſe it. Moreouer in vomites, the matter brought forth, wold be conſydered, accordyng to the rules of Hipocrates, Hipocra. praeſag. 2. cap. 7. in his ſeconde boke of pronoſtications, that is to ſay, if it be myxt with fleme and coler, it

is moſt profitable if it be not in very great quātite, nor thick, the laſſe mixture it hath, the wars is it. If it be grene, like to leke blades, thyn or blak, it is to be iuged yll. If it haue al colours, it is extreme perillous. If it be ledy coloured, & ſauorith horribly, it ſignifieth a ſhort aboli

caſes, and where it is peynfull to vomite, and in gnawyng or frettinges of the ſtomake, finally in all replecions, where a man can not or wyl not be let bloudde or vomite, it is expedient to prouoke ſiege by purgations, whiche are receiued by two wayes: vpwarde at the foundement by ſuppoſitories or clyſters. Downeward at the mouth, by potions, electuaries, or pylles. Suppoſitories at vſed, where the pacient is weake, and maye not

                  eceyue any other purgations. ſometyme for as moche as the ſtrayt gutte is ſtopped with excrementes, which ar drie and hard: ſomtime where there nedeth none other pourgation, ſpecially in bournyng feuers, wherof the matter aſcendeth in to the heed, than cliſters may do harme, & by the benefit of ſuppoſitories, excrementes at brought forthe without any annoyāce. And oftentymes it bringeth forth that, whiche clyſters maye nat.
               Suppoſitories at made ſomtime with hony only, ſodden, rolled on a bourde, and made rounde, ſmaller at the one ende than at the other, & of the length and greatnes, according to the quātitie of the body that taketh it. Somtyme there is myxte with the hony ſalt dried, or ſalt peter, or the powder of ſuche thinges, as do eyther purge the humor, which offēdeth, or diſſolueth groſſe windes, or other matter: they be ſomtyme made with toſeyn, pitche, ware, or gūmes, ſomtime of rotes, or the leaues of mercury grene, very ſmall bruiſed. alſo with figgis or reiſons, the ſtones takē out, or of white ſope, made i the figure aforſaid, & being

It is a cōuenient and ſure medicine, and leſt hurt doth enſue of it.

               IN potions, electuaties, and pylles ought to be moch more obſeruation, than in clyſters or ſuppoſitories, for as moche as theſe do enter no further

                  of bloud, or haue abundāce of ſtrength, but alſo for them, in whom, without plenitude, callyd fulnes, inflammations begyn to be in their bodies, or by ſome outwarde ſtroke, the bloude being gathered within, by collection therof, do fele griefe or diſeaſe. Alſo where there is moche peyne felte, or debilitie of ſome member, wherof is ſuppoſed to be ingendred ſome greuous diſeaſe. Moreouer they whiche vſe exceſſe of meates and drynkes, maye be cured by lettynge of bloudde. But thoſe, whiche be temperate, kepynge good diete, be holpen without lettynge of bloud: as by fricaſies, vſing of bathes, exerciſe, walkynge, and tydyng moderately. Alſo vnctions with oyles and oyntementes, callyd Diaphoreticae, whiche by euaporation, do ſhortely euacuate the fulneſſe. All be it, if the fulneſſe be of melancolye bloud, than alwaye nedes muſte be lettynge of bloudde. Aboundaunce of melancolye bloudde is knowen by theſe ſygnes. There is felt in the entrayles, or within the bulke of a man or woman, a weyghtyneſſe with tenſion or thruſtyng outwarde. and all that part, whiche is aboue the nauel, is more heuy, than it was wont to be. Alſo moch vain and fatty, the reſidc̄ce or bottom thycke, troublous, and fatte. ſomtyme

blacke pouſhes or boyles, with inflamation and moch peyne. Theſe muſt be ſhortly let bloud, and the melancoly humor alſo purged by ſiege. They whiche haue crude or raw humors, muſt be warely let bloudde, before that ſykneſſe ingender, but hauynge the feuer, in no wyſe. Concerninge lettyng Acti. ll. 3 of bloud, theſe thinges folowyng, wold be hadde in continuall remembraunce, and be afore thought on. In abundance of the bloud, the qualitie and quantitie, the greatneſſe of the ſycknes, and if it be preſent, or loked for. alſo the diete precedynge, the age and ſtrength of the perſone, the naturall fourme of his body, the time of the yere, the region or coūtrey, the preſent ſtate of the aire the diſvſe of accuſtomed exerciſe, the ceſſyng of euacuations vſed before. In qualitie conſyder, of what humour the fulneſſe procedeth. In quantititie the abūdance of that, which is to be purged. In ſiknes, if it be dangerous or tollerable: if the ſiknes be preſent, it requireth the more diligēce: if it be loked for, it may be the better proporcioned. In diet, the cuſtom in eating & drinking, muſt be ſpecially noted. In yong men & womē, lettyng of bloud wold be more liberall. In old men & yonge children, it wold be ſcarſer: ſtronge men may ſuſteyne bledyng, they which ar feble, maye not endure it: Large bodies haue greater veſſels, than they, whiche be litell. leane men haue more blod, corporate men haue more fleſhe. The tyme of the Cor. Celſus li. 3. yere muſt be ſpecially marked. For in the begynning of ſpringe tyme is the beſt letting of bloud,

as Dribaſius ſayth, and ſo dothe continue, after the opinion of Arnolde, vnto the eighte calendes Oriba. ſu. Arnoldus de uilla noua de flobothomia. lo. Dama ſcenus in arte med. of Iune. Aetius affirmeth, that in wynter, or in a colde countrey, or where the perſon is of a very colde nature, the vaynes ſhulde not be opened. And Damaſcene ſaythe, They whiche in youthe haue vſed to be moch let bloud, after they be thre ſcore yeres olde, their nature waxeth colde, and naturall heate is in them ſuffocate, ſpeciallye if they were of a colde complexion. but that is to be vnderſtande, where they that are in helth, are often let bloud. For in the lapſe from helthe, and in dyuers diſeaſes, wherin the bloude is corrupted, or where it ingedreth impoſtumes, or reſorteth to any place, where it ought not to be, or paſſeth by any other cundyte, than nature hath ordeyned, or where it is furious or inflamed, or by any other meanes bredeth greuous diſeaſes, in all theſe caſes, it ought to be practiſed, ye ſometyme in aged perſons, women with childe, and yong infantes. For in extreme neceſſitie it were better experience ſome remedy, than to do nothynge. Al other thinges concernynge this matter, pertayn to the part curatiue, whiche treateth of healyng of ſycknes, wherof I wyll not nowe ſpeake, but remytte the reders to the counſayle of diſcrete phiſitions.
            
            
               Of ſcarifyeng callyd boxyng or cuppyng. Cap. vii.
               FOr as moche as it is not conuenient, to be let Galenus. bloud oftentymes in the yere, bicauſe moch of

the vytall ſpirite, paſſeth forth with the bloudde, Acti• li. 3. whiche being exhauſt, the body waxeth colde, and natural operations becom the more feble, I ther fore do counſayle (ſaith Galen) that the baſe partes of the body, as the legges, be ſcarified, which is the moſte ſure remedy, as well in conſeruynge helthe, as in repayrynge therof, beinge decayed. For it cureth the eyen being annoyed with longe dyſtillations. It profiteth alſo to the heed, and ouer parte of the body againſt ſondry diſeaſes. In what member the bloud is gathered, the body being fyrſt purged by ſcarification, the grefe maye be cured. Alſo Oribaſius affirmeth the ſame, and alſo addeth therto, that it helpeth ſquynances, or Oribaſius in medici ne compendio. quinces in the throte, and diſſolueth the conſtipa tions or ſtoppinges made of al places, if the places be ſcarified: not withſtanding application of boxes about the ſtomake, in hot feuers, where reſon is troubled, ar to be eſchewed, for feare of ſuffocation. Lykewiſe put to the heed vndiſcretely, it hurteth both the heed and the cies. The late authors Actius. do affirme, that ſcarifieng is in the ſtede of lettyng bloudde, where for age, debilitie, or tyme of the yere, or other lyke conſyderation, a manne may not ſuſteyn bloud lettynge, and it bryngethe forth the thyn blod, which is next to the ſkynne.
            
            
               Of bloud ſuckers or leaches. Cap viii.
               THere is alſo an other fourme of euacuation by wormes, founde in waters called bloude

ſuckers, or leaches, which being put vnto the body or member, doo drawe out bloudde. And their drawyng is more conuenient for fulneſſe of blod thanne ſcarifienge is, for as moche as they fetche bloude more deper, and is more of the ſubſtance of bloude. yet the opinion of ſomme men is, that they do drawe no bloudde but that, which is corrupted, and not proporcionable vnto our body. And therfore in griefes, whiche happen betwene the ſkynne and the fluſſhe of bloudde corrupted, theſe are more conuenient than ſcarifienge. But before that they be put vnto any part of the body Oribaſius in medici ne compendio. they muſt be fyrſt kept all one day before, giuing vnto them a lyttell bloude in freſſhe fleſſhe. And than put them in a clene water, ſomwhat warme, and with a ſpounge wype away the flyme, which is about them, and than lay a lyttell bloud on the place greued, and put them than to it, and lay on theym a ſpounge, that whan they be fulle, they may falle away, or if ye wyll ſooner haue theym of, putte a horſe heare bytweene theyr mouthes, and the place, and drawe theym awaye, or putte to their mouthes ſalte or aſſhes, or vyneger, and forthewith they ſhall falle, and than waſſhe the place with a ſpounge, and yf there doo yſſue moche bloudde, laye on the place the poulder of a ſpounge, and pytche bourned, or lynnen clothe bourned, or galles bourned, or the herbe callyd Burſa pastoris bruyſed. And this ſuffyſeth concernyng bloud ſuckers.
            
            
               
               ¶ Of hemoroides or pyles. Cap. ix.
               HEmorroides be vaynes in the foundement, of whom do happen ſondry paſſions. ſometyme ſwellyng, without bledynge, ſometyme ſuperfluous bloud by the puiſſance of nature, is by them expelled, and than be they very conuenient. for by them a man ſhall eſcape many great ſyckneſſes, whiche be ingendred of corrupted bloud, or of melancoly. Semblably, if they be haſtylye ſtopped frome the courſe, whiche they haue bene vſed to, therby do increaſe the ſayd ſykneſſes, which by them were expelled, as dropſies, cōſumptions, madnes, franſies, and diuers diſeaſes of the heed, and other ſykneſſes, palenes of the vyſage, griefe in the raines of the backe, and thies. And if they flow to moch, there inſueth feblenes, leannes of the body, alteration of colour, great peines in the lower partes of the bodye. And if the fluxe be vnmoderate, it ingendreth myſcheuous diſeaſes. Wherfore it wolde be diligentely taken hede, that they runne in meſure, or els to vſe ſome thinges moderately, whiche may reſtrayn them.
               ¶ Concernyng other euacuatiōs, I do purpoſely omytte to wryte of theym in this place, for as moche as in this realme, it hath bene accompted not honeſt, to declare them in the vulgar tongue, but onely ſecretely.
            
            
               Of affectes of the mynde. Cap. x.
               THe laſt of thinges callid not naturall, is not the leaſt parte to be conſydered, the whyche

is of affectes and paſſions of the mynde. For yf they be immoderate, they do not onely anoye the body, & ſhorten the lyfe, but alſo they do appaire, and ſomtime loſe vtterly a mans eſtimation. And that moche more is, they bringe a man from the vſe of reaſon, and ſometyme in the diſpleaſure of almighty god. wherfore they do not only require the helpe of phiſyke corporall, but alſo the counſell of a man wyſe and well lerned in morall philoſophye. Wherfore after that I haue recyted, what they be, I wyll briefely declare ſuche counſayles, as I haue gathered. And as concernynge remedies of phiſike ſauing a few ſymples, which do comfort the harte & ſpirites, the reſidue I wyl remytte to the counſayle of phiſitions, lyke as I haue done in euacuation. Affectes of the mynde, wherby the body is annoyed, and do bring in ſiknes, be theſe, yre or wrath, heuynes or ſorow, glad nes, or reioycyng.
            
            
               ¶ Of Ire. Cap. xi.
               IRe is kendlyd in the harte, inordinately chaufyng the ſpirites there, and than is ſent forthe into the members, and doth ſuperfluouſly heate them, and diſturbeth reaſon, where the bodyes be hotte afore. Where naturall heate is feeble, the heate may nat be diſperſed vnto the extreme partes, and than dothe the extreme members, that is to ſay, whiche are farre frome the harte, remayne colde, and tremblynge. Of this affection cometh

ſometyme feuers, ſometime apoplexies, or priuation of ſencis, tremblyng, palſeys, madnes, fran ſies, deformitie of viſage, and that warſe is, outragious ſwearynge, blaſphemy, deſyre of vengeance, loſſe of charitie, amitie, credence, alſo forgetfulnes of benefite precedynge, and of obedience, duetie, and reuerence. There alſo do ſuccede contencion, chargeable ſuite, vnquietnes of mynde, lacke of appetite, lacke of flepe, feeble digeſtion, ſcorne, diſdayne, and hatrede of other, with peryl of loſyng of all good reputation. Theſe incommodities of Ire, perfitely had in remembrance, & at the fyrſt motion therof one of them thought on, may happen to brynge in his felowes, & therby the flame may be quenched. or let hym that is angry, euen at the fyrſt conſyder one of theſe thin ges, that lyke as he is a man, ſo is alſo the other, with whom he is angrye, and therfore it is as lefull for the other to be angry, as vnto hym, and if he ſo be, than ſhall that anger be to hym diſpleaſant, and ſtere hym more to be angry. Wherby it appereth, that Ire is to hym lothſome. If the other be pacient, than let hym abhorte that thinge in hym ſelfe, the lacke whereof, in the other contenteth hym, and aſſwageth his malice. More ouer, let hym before, that occaſion of Ire doth happen, accuſtome hym ſelfe to beholde, and marke well them that be angry, with the ſucceſſe of that anger. & ruminate it in his mynde, a good ſpace after. And in that tyme, let hym remember, how Chriſte, the ſonne of God and God, who (as he

hym ſelfe ſayd) mought haue had of God his father, if he woldehaue aſked them, legions of angels to haue defended hym, ye with laſſe than a wynke, mought haue ſlayne all his aduerſaries, yet he not withſtandyng rebuked, ſcorned, falſely accuſed, plucked hyther & thyther, ſtryped, bounden with halters, whypped, ſpytte on, buffetted, crowned with ſharpe thorne, laded with a heuye piece of tymber, his owne proper torment, halyd, & driuen forth lyke a calfe to the ſlaughter houſe, eftſones beaten and ouerthrowen, retched forthe with ropes, armes and legges layd on the croſſe, and thervnto with long yron nailes through the handes and fete nailed, with many ſtrokes of hā
                  mers, with many prickynges, or euer the nayles mought perce by his tender & moſt bleſſed fleſſhe, and ſynewes, quyte throughe the harde tymber, vp to the heedes of the nayles, and all this being done for the offence of mankynd, and not his, yet with the men, whiche dyd it, his mooſte vnkynde countrey men, his moſt vnnaturall kynneſinen, whom he fyrſte made of nothynge, preſerued by myracles, delyuered from perylles, and cured of dyſeaſes, in all his vexation and trouble, he was neuer ſene or perceyued angry. If one wyll ſaye, that Anger is naturall, lette hym alſo conſyder, that in Chriſtis manhoode were all naturall powers. If he wyll ſaye, that Ire is token of courage, and in Chriſte it lacked not, whom both angels and deuyls trembled and feared. The premyſſes often reuolued, and borne in the mynde, I

wyll not ſay, ſhall vtterly extincte all motions of wrath, whiche is not poſſible, but it ſhal, whan it kyndleth lyghtly repreſſe it, and lette that it ſhall not growe into flame. And in ſpeakynge here of wrathe, I do not meane that, which good menne haue agaynſt vices: or wyſe and diſcrete gouernours, and maiſters, ageinſte the defautes or negligences of their ſubiectes or ſeruauntes, vſed in rebukynge them, or moderately punyſſhynge them. For that is not properly yre, but rather to be callyd diſpleſure, and is that wherof god ſpeketh, by his prophete Dauid, ſayenge, Be you angry, and do not ſynne. And that maner of anger, Pſal. 4. Geneſ. 31. Exod. 32. Leuit. 10. Marc. 11. hath ben in dyuers holy men, prophetes, and other. And it appered in Chriſte, whan he draue oute theym, whyche made their markette, in the holy temple of god, where there oughte to be nothynge but prayer. And in lyke wyſe whan he rebuked the hypocrites. But yf none of theſe thinges may come ſo ſhortely to his remembraunce, that is meued with anger, at the leaſte, lette hym thynke on the leſſon, that Apollodorus the phyloſopher, taught to the emperour Octauian, that before he ſpeake or do any thynge in anger, he do recite in order, al the letters of the A, B, C, and remoue ſomwhat out of the place, that he is in, and ſeke occaſion to be otherwiſe occupied. This ſhal for this time ſuffiſe, for the remedies of Ire. And he that wyl knowe more of this matter, lette hym rede in my warke, callyd the Gouernour, where I therof do write more abundantly.

This is ſo puiſſant an enemye to nature and bodily helth, that to reſyſte the malyce and violence therof, are required remedies, as well of the holſome counſayles founde in holy cripture, and in the bokes of morall doctrine, as alſo of certayne herbes, fruites, and ſpyces, hauynge the propretie to expelle melancolyke humours, and to comfor

Nowe fyrſt I wyll declare

ſome remedies ageynſt ſorowfulneſſe of hart, cō
                  cernynge neceſſary counſayle.
               Sometyme this affecte hapneth of Ingratitude, eyther where for benefite, or ſpecial loue employed, one receyueth damage, or is abandoned in his neceſſitie, or is deceyued of hym, whom he truſted, or fyndeth hym, of whom he hath greate expectation, forgetfull or neglygent in his cōmoditie, or perceyueth the perſone, whome of longe tyme he hath loued, to be eſtraunged from him, or to haue one of later acquayntaunce in more eſtymation. This affection nyppeth the harte, ye of moſte wyſemen, for they loue moſte hartily, not prouoked by carnal affection, but rather by good opinion, ingēdred by ſimilitude of honeſt ſtudies and vertuous maners of longe tyme mutuallye experiēced. And it is not only vnto mā greuous, but alſo vnto god moſt diſpleaſant and odious, as it is abundantly declared in ſcripture. Wherfore the perſone, whiche feleth hym ſelfe touched with this affecte, before that it growe into a paſſion, and waxeth a ſyckneſſe, lette hym call to remembrance theſe articles folowyng, or at the leſt ways ſome of them, for eueryche of theym maye eaſe hym, though perchaunce they can nat forthe with perfitly cute hym.
               ¶ Conſyder, that the corruptiō of mans nature is not ſo moch declared in any thing, as in ingratitude, Loūiaſles ageinſt ingratitude. wherby a man is made warſe, thā dyuers brute beaſtes. The lytell ant or emote helpeth vp his felow, whom he ſeeth ouerthrowen with burdeyn,

or, by other occaſion. Alſo whan olyphantes do paſſe ouer any great water, the gretteſt & moſt Appianns in varia hiſtoria. puiſſant of them diuide them ſelfes, and ſettinge the weakeſt in the myddell, part go before, trieng the depenes and peryls, parte come after, ſuccouryng the weakeſt or leaſt, with their longe noſes, whan they ſe them in danger. The ſame beaſtes haue ben ſene not onely brynge men out of deſerces, which haue loſt their ways, but alſo reuenge the diſpleaſures done to them, the whiche gaue them meate, as one that ſlewe him, which had cō
                  mytted aduoutrie with his mayſters wyfe. The terrible Lyons and Panthers, haue ben ſeene in their maner, to render thankes to their benefactours, ye and to obiecte their owne bodyes and lyues for their defence. The ſame we may daylye beholde in our owne dogges. Thā in whom thou fyndeſt the deteſtable vyce of Ingratitude, reputynge hym amonge the warſt ſorte of creatures, thinke not that thou haſte loſt a frende, but think that thou arte delyuered from a monſter of nature, that deuoured thy loue, & that thou art now at libertie, and haſt won experience to cheſe the a better. But if this may not ſuffiſe, than eftſones conſyder, that if thou loke well on thy ſelfe perchance Seneca, de benefi. 7. thou mayſt fynde the faute, wherof thou complayneſt, within thyn owne boſome. Calle to thy remembrance, if thou haſt alway rendred vnto euery man condigne thankes or benefytte, of whom thou haſt kyndnes receiued, or if thou haſt alway remeinbred, euery one of theym, that haue

doone to the any commoditie or pleaſure. Thou ſhalte well perceyue, that what thynge thou rereceyuedſt in childhode, thou forgatteſt or diddeſt litel eſteme, whan thou camiſt to the ſtate of a mā. And what thou dyddeſte remember in youthe, in age thou dyddeſt littell thynke on: thy nouryces pappe, her rockynges, her watchynges, thou haſt not alway remembred, or equally recompenſed.
               Thy ſchole mayſters ſtudy, his labour, his dilygēce, in a like degre, thou haſt not required. What greter frēdes haſt thou had, of whom thou couldeſt receyue any gretter benefites, than thy noriſhyng and preſeruyng of thy lyfe, in thy moſt feblenes, or thyn erudicion, wherby thy nature was made more excellent. Remembrynge this, leaue to be angry or ſorowfull for ſo cōmon a vice, yet if it ceſſe not to greue the, cōferre the ingratitude that doth vexe the, with that ingratitude, whiche was ſhewed by the Iſraelites, whome god chaſe for his owne people, delyuered from ſeruage, ſhewed for them wōders, preſerued them forty yeres in deſert, deſtroyd for them kynges, gaue to them the countrey, whiche flowed mylke and hony, defended them ageynſt all outwarde hoſtilitie, ſente vnto them ſuch abundance of ryches, that ſyluer was in Hieruſalē, as ſtones in the ſtrete, had his tabernacle, and afterwarde his moſte holye temple amonge them, which he dyd dayly vyſit with his diuine maieſtie, made their kynges to reigne gloryouſely, and ſpake with their prophetes famylyarlye, and corrected theyr errours mooſte

gentilly: and yet for all this, they imbracyng the paynyms idolatrie, they left ſo gracious and louyng a lorde, and lyuyng god, and to his greatte deſpite, gaue diuine honours, to calues of braſſe, and other monſtruous images, and at the laſte, put to moſte cruell dethe, the onely ſonne of god, that had done ſo moche for them.
               And if we chriſten men, do loke well on our ſelues, reuoluynge the incomparable benefite, whiche we haue receyued by Chriſtis paſſion, and cō
                  ſyder the circumſtance of his moſte excellent pacience, and moſte feruent loue towarde vs, with our forgetfulneſſe, and the dayly breache of oure promyſe, whiche we made at our baptyſme, conferryng our mutuall vnkyndnes thervnto, there ſhall appere none ingratitude that ſhulde offend vs. Fynally for a concluſion, beholde well about the, and thou ſhalt al day fynde the chylderne ingrate to their parentes, and wyues to their huſbandes. And wylte thou loke that thy benefite or vayne expectation, ſhuld make the more fre from ingratitude of thy frende, whome chaunce hath ſent the, than nature maye the parentes to warde their childrē, or the coniūction of bodyes by lefull mariage, take vnkyndeneſſe from the wyues toward their huſbandes. This vice therfore of Ingratitude, beinge ſo common a chance, make no worldly frendſhyp ſo precious, that lyfe or helthe therfore ſhulde be ſpent or conſumed. I haue ben the lengar in this place, bycauſe I haue hadde in this griefe ſufficient experience.
               
                  
¶ If deathe of chylderne be cauſe of thy heuyneſſe, Deathe of chylderne. call to thy remembrance ſome chylderne (of whome there is no lyttell number) whoſe lyues either for vncortigible vices, or infortunate chances, haue ben more greuous vnto their parentes, than the death of thy chyldren, oughte to be vnto the: conſydering that deth is the diſcharger of al griefes and myſeries, and to them that dye well, the fyrſt entrie into lyfe euerlaſtynge.
               ¶ The loſſe of goodes or authoritie doo greue Loſſe of goodes. none but fooles, which do not marke diligently, that lyke as neyther the one nor the other doth alway happen to them that are worthy, ſo we haue in dayly experience, that they falle from hym ſodeynly, who in increaſynge or kepynge theym ſemeth moſte buſye.
               ¶ Oftentymes the repulſe frome promotion is Lache of promtiō. cauſe of diſcomforte. but than conſyder, whether in the opinion of good men, thou art demed worthy to haue ſuche aduauncement, or in thyn owne expectation and fantaſy. If good men ſo iudge the, thanke thou god of that felicitie, and laughe at the blyndneſſe of them, that ſoo haue refuſed the. If it procede of thyne owne folye, abhorte al arrogance, and inforce thy ſelf to be aduanced in mens eſtimation, before thou canſt fynde thy ſelf worthy in thy proper opinion.
               ¶ All other chaunces of fortune, eſteme as noo Chaunces of fortune thynge, & that longe before they do happen. The ofte recordynge of myſerie, prepareth the mynde to fele leſſe aduerſite. And the cōtempt of fortune

               ¶ The domynion of ſondry complexions. Capitulo. xiii.
               IT ſemeth to me not inconuenient, that I doo declare as well the counſayles of ancient and approued authors, as alſo myne owne opynion gathered by diligent marking in daily experiēce, concernyng as well the neceſſary diete of euerye complexion, age and declination of helth, as alſo the meane to reſyſte diſcraſies of the body, before

ſyckenes be therin confirmed, leauynge the reſidue vnto the ſubſtāciall lerning and circumſpect practiſe of good phiſitions, whiche ſhal the more eaſily cure the pacientes, if their pacientes do not diſdayne to beare away and folowe my counſell.
               And fyrſt it ought to be conſidred, that none of the foure complexions, haue ſooly ſuche dominion in one man or womans body, that no parte of any other complexion is therwith myxt. For whā we call a man ſanguine, colerike, fleumatike, or melancolye, we do not meane, that he hath bloud only without any of the other humours, or coler without bloud, or fleume without bloude or melancoly, or melancoly without blod or coler. And therfore the man, whyche is ſanguyne, the more that he draweth into age, wherby naturall moyſture decayeth, the more is he colerike, by reaſone that heate, ſurmountynge moyſture, nedes muſt remayne heate and drithe. ſemblably the colerike man, the more that he waxeth into aege, the more naturall heate in hym is abated, and drythe ſurmountyng naturall moyſture, he becometh melancolyke: but ſome ſanguyne man hath in the proporcion of temperatures, a greatter myxture with coler, than an other hath. Likewiſe the colerike or fleumatike man with the humour of ſanguine or melancoly. And therfore late practiſers of phiſike are wont to call men, accordyng to the mixture of their complexions, whiche man receiueth in his generation, the humours, wherof the ſame complexions do conſiſt, beinge augmented

ſuperfluouſly in the body or members by any of the ſaid thinges callid not natural, euery of them do ſemblably augment the complexion, which is proper vnto hym, and bryngeth vnequall temperature vnto the bodye. And for theſe cauſes, the ſanguine or fleumatike man or woman, felynge any diſcraſy by choler hapned to them by the ſaid thynges callyd not Naturalle, they ſhall vſe the dyete deſcribed hereafter to hym, whyche is naturally colerike. Semblably the coleryke or melancolyke man or woman, hauyng any diſcraſye by fleume, to vſe the diete of hym, which is naturally fleumatike, alway remembrynge, that ſanguyne and fleumatycke men haue more reſpecte vnto drithe, colerike and melancolyke vnto moiſture, and that alway as the accidētall complexiō decayeth, to reſort by lyttell and lytel to the diete, pertaynyng to his naturall complexion.

               BVt fyrſte it muſte be conſydered, that where the foure humours, be alway in manne, and in ſomme man commonly one humoure is more aboundant than an nother naturally, that is to ſaye, from his generation. The ſayde humours haue alſo peculyar tymes aſſygned to euery oone of theym, wherin eche of them is in his moſt power and force, as after enſueth, after the deſcription of Soranus. Soranus Epheſius.
               
               
                  
¶ Fleume hath moſte puiſſance in wynter, from the .viii. Idus of Nouember, vnto the .viii. Idus of Februarye, whereby are ingendred Catarres or reumes, the vuula, the cough, and the ſtytche.

               ¶ Redde choler hath power in ſommer from the viii. Idus of May, vntyl the .viii. Idus of Auguſt, wherby are ingendred hotte and ſharpe feuers, this humoure is ſpecially in the lyuer, and hath dominion from the thirde houre of day, vntyll the .ix. houre of the ſame day.

Blacke coler or melancoly moſte raigneth in the ſplene, and it raigneth from the nynthe howre of daye, vntylle the thirde howre of nyght.

If it be of black coler, giue thinges hotte moyſt and ſwete, for blacke coler is ſharpe and cold. If the diſeaſe be of ſalt fleume, gyue thynges ſwete hot and drie, thus ſayth Soranus.

               MElancolye is of two ſortes, the one is called naturall, whiche is onelye colde and drye,

the other is callyd aduſte or bourned. Naturall melancolye is as Galene ſaythe) the reſydence or dregges of the bloud: and therfore is colder and thycker than the bloude. Melancoly aduſte is in foure kyndes, eyther it is of naturall melancoly aduſt, or of the more pure parte of the bloudde aduſte, or of choler aduſt, or of ſalt fleume aduſt. But of all other that melancoly is wa

The natural melancoly Ex Marel lio ficino. de uita ſana. kepte in his temperance, profyteth moche to true iugement of the wyt, but yet if

Wherfore it may not be ſo litell, that the bloud and ſpirites in their feruentnes, be as it were vnbridlyd, wherof do happen vnſtableneſſe of wytte & ſlipper remembraunce: nor yet ſo moche, that by the weight therof (for it is heuy, approchynge nyghe to the

Cruditie is a vycious concoction of thynges receyued, they not being holly or perfitely altered. The cauſe therof is, ſometyme the diſtemperature of the ſtomak, ſomtime inflammations, ſomtime matter congeled, or impoſtumes in the ſtomake, otherwhile ingurgitation of meate and drinke: or for the vicious qualitie of the ſame meates or drinkes, or the

Galene addeth therto ſalte peter, called in latyn Nitrum. The confection made with the iuyce of quynces, and is called Diacytoniten, is very excellent, but it is to be diligently noted, that where eruditie is in a cholerike perſonne, there wolde the ſayde medicines be temperatly vſed, and the ſayde Diacytoniten, to haue lytell or no ſpices in it. And for my part, beynge the ſpace of foure yeres continually in this cruditie, I neuer founde any thinge to be compared to fyne Reubarbe, chewed with rayſons of corens, which I toke by the counſayle of the worſhypfull and well lerned phiſition, maſter Doctour Auguſtine, who in his maners declareth the auncient gentylneſſe of his bloud, which medicine I do not leaue to vſe dayely faſtinge, whan I fele ſuche cruditie to begynne.

Alſo in that caſe Oxymel, that is to ſay, hony and water ſodden togither, with the ſayde rootes and ſedes, and a quantitie of vyneger put therto in the boylynge, is very commendable, yf the pacient be very coſtiue, than the medicine of Galene, called Hierapicra, frome halfe an ounce to an ounce, taken in water of hony or ale, or taken in pylles the weyght of a grote and a h

               LAſſicude is a diſpoſition towarde ſyckneſſe, wherin a man feleth a ſooreneſſe, a ſwellynge or an inflammation. Soreneſſe hapneth of humours ſharpe and gnawing, as after great exerciſe and labours, whyche laſſitude hapneth to them, whoſe bodies are full of yl iuyce and excrementes. Alſo after cruditie in them, whiche ar not exerciſed, or doo abyde longe in the heate of the Acti• li. 3. ſonne. It may alſo be in the body, wherin is good iuyce, if he be fatigate with immoderate exerciſe. In them, whiche do fele this laſſitude, the ſkinne Galen' de menda ſa ni. lib. 5. appereth thicke and rough, & there is felt a grefe ſomtyme in the ſkynne onely, ſomtyme alſo in the fleſhe, as it were of a ſoore. The cure therof, is by moche and pleaſant rubbyng, with ſwete oyles, whyche haue not the vertue to reſtrayne or cloſe, and that with many handes, and afterward to exerciſe moderately, and to be bayned in water ſwete and temperate in heate. alſo than muſte be gyuen meates of good iuyce, potage but ſelde, wyne is not to be forboden. for vnto wyne, vneth any thynge may be compared, that ſo well dygeſteth crude humours. it alſo prouoketh ſweatte & vrine, and maketh one to ſlepe ſoūdly. but if this laſſitude do abyde the nyght and day folowyng, or waxeth more and more, than if the paciente be of good ſtrength and yong, and hath abundance of bloude, let hym be let bloud, or prouoke the hemoroides or piles to blede, if they do appere. But

yf it procede of the malyce of any humour, without abundance of bloud, than reſort to purgatiōs apte for the humour that greeueth. The tokens wherof, ſhall appere as well by the colour of the ſkynne and die

If the yll bloudde be lytell in quantitie, and the crude humours aboundant, than ſhal he not be let bloud, nor vehemētly pourged, neyther ſhall exercyſe or moue hym ſelf, nor be bayned, for all exerciſe carieth humors throughout al the body, and ſtoppith the powers. Wherfore theſe maner of perſons, ſhuld be kept in reſt, and ſuche meates drynkes and medicines ſhuld be gyuen to them, whiche ſhulde attenuate or diſſolue the groſſenes of the humors, without notable heate, as oxymell, barley water, & muiſe, if the pacient abhorre not hony. And for as moch as in the ſayde perſonnes, commonly there is abundance of wynde about their ſtomackes, therfore pepper, ſpeciallye longe pepper, or whyte, is very conuenient to be vſed, and the medicine before writen, callid Diaſpoliticum. Whan the humors are diſſolued, thā is it good to drinke white wine, or ſmall clarette wyne moderately.

ſwellyng, that is callyd Laſſitude extenſiue, if it hapneth without exerciſe or vehement mouynge. This doth happen of exceſſiue multitude of humors, which do extende the muſcules or fyllettes. In this no ſorenes is felt, but onely an heuyneſſe with extenſion or thruſtyng out of the body. And bycauſe that there is abundance of bloude in the body, beſt remedy is to be letten bloude about the the elbow or ancle, after to be purged, than to vſe ſofte fricaſyes with oyles afore reherſed, afterward moche reſt and temperate bathes, and meates lackyng ſharpnes, and beinge abſterſiue.

If the grefe be in the neck or hed, the bloud muſt be lette of the vayne called Cephalea, or the ſhulder vayne. If it be in the bulke or vppermoſt part of the body, than muſt the vaine be cut, whiche is callyd Baſilica, or the innermoſt vayne. If all the body be greued, thā cut the veyn, which is named Mediana. or the myddel vayn. If a feuer

remayne after bloud letting, than order him with the diete of them that haue feuers, which ye ſhall fynde written hereafter. If noo feuer remayne, than vſe moderate fricaſies, and lyttell eatyng, & that of meates hauyng good iuyce, increacynge by lyttell and lyttell to the naturall diete.

As touchyng the fyrſt, the generall diete muſt be ſuche, as therby the humours may be attenuate, and by conuenient euacuation, brought to a moderate quantitie. As for the ſeconde muſte be corrected with meates and drinkes of contrary qualities, hauyng alway reſpecte to the age of the perſon, tyme of the yere, place of habitation, and moſt ſpecially the vniuerſall complexion, for choler offendynge in an olde manne, in wynter tyme, in a colde countreye, or the perſone beinge of his natural complexion fleumatike or melancoly, wolde not be ſo habūdantly expulſed or ſubdewed, as if it be in one yong and luſty, in the hot ſommer, in the coūtreys, where the ſonne feruently burneth, or the perſone of his proper nature is verye colerike. And in lykewiſe contrarye. Wherfore euery manne, knowynge his owne naturall

complexion, with the qualitie of the humour that offendeth, lette hym make temperance his chiefe coke, and remembrynge that whiche I haue before declared, ordeyne to hym ſelfe ſuche diete, as may refourme the offence with none or lyttel annoyaunce, to his vniuerſall complexion. And yf he can ſo do, he ſhall happily eſcape, not only dyuers ſyckeneſſes, but alſo the mooſte pernicious dāger, proceding of corrupted drowges or ſpices, wherof ſom couetous poticaries do make medycynes, maugre the hedes of good and wel lerned phiſytions.

Whan any dyſeaſe approcheth to the heed, theſe tokens do commonly precede, ſwymmynge in the heed, heed ache, heuynes of the browes, ſoundynge in the eares, pryckynges in the temples, the eyes in the mornynge do water, or waxe dynime, the ſmellynge is dulle, y• gummes do ſwelle. Whan thou feleſt ſuche tokens, forthwith pourge the heed with ſomwhat, not with vehemēt medecines, but takynge Iſope or Organum, and the croppes of them boyle with whyte or claret wyne halfe a pynte, and therwith gargariſe your mouth faſtinge, vntyl the fleume be purged oute of poure heed, this is the eaſyeſt

medicine in diſcraſies of the heed. It is alſo very holſome to gargariſe the mouthe and breſt with hony water, wherinto muſtarde is put and myngled, but firſte the heed muſt be rubbed with a warme clothe, that the fleume maye eaſyly come out of the heed. And yf theſe tokens be neglected, theſe maner of ſyckeneſſes do folowe ſone after, bleared eyes, & humour lettinge y• ſight, cleftes in the eares, ſwellynges in the necke full of matter, called the kynges euyll, corruption of the brayne, poſes, or reumes, heuyneſſe of the hed, and tooth ache.
               Whā the boulke is lyke to ſuffer any ſickenes it is perceyued by theſe tokens, all the body is in a ſweatte, the bulke moſt ſpecially, the tunge waxeth thicke, the ſpettyll is eyther ſalt or bitter, or cholerike, the ſydes and ſhoulders do ake without any occaſion, the pacient gapeth often, alſo there dothe happen moche wakynge, ſuffocations or lacke of breth, thirſt after ſlepe, the mynd is vexed with heuyneſſe, alſo the breſt and armes are verye colde, and the handes do tremble. Againſt theſe thinges this remedy may be prouy ded. After a moderate ſoupper, aſſaye to vomite withoute any medycine, vomyte is alſo profytable, whiche meate dothe folowe: He that in ſuche wyſe will vomite, let him eate haſtyly ſmall radyſſhe rootes, townketſis, rokat, ſynuy, or purſlane, and drynke after it a greate quantitie of warme water, and prouoke him ſelfe to vomyte. He that ſetteth lyttell by the ſayde tokens,

let hym feare theſe ſyckneſſes folowing, the pleureſie, the ſickenes of the lunges, melancolye or madnes, ſharpe feuers, the franſye, the letargie, inflamation with yexinge.
               If any ſyckeneſſe be towarde the bealye, they maye be eſpied by theſe tokens, the bealy is fyrſte wrapped together, and in it ſelfe is troubled, all meates and drinkes do ſeeme bytter in taſt, he feleth heuyneſſe in his knees, a ſtyffenes in his loynes, a wearyneſſe in all his body without any occaſion, a ſlepyneſſe in his legges, with a lyttel feuer, whan thou feleſte theſe tokens, mollyfie the bealy, not with medicyne, but with good order of diete, for it is beſt and moſt ſure, to vſe thoſe thinges, wherof lyghtly may enſue none annoyance, in the number of them are betes boyled in water of hony, garlike ſodden, malowes, ſorel, mercury, and al thinges condite in hony. All theſe do expell the ordute of the bely: but if any of the ſaid ſignes dothe more & more increaſe, the lyquour, wherein the ſede of Carthamus, callyd alſo Cnicus, is boyled, is a pleſant & ſure medicine. ſmal colewortes boiled in a good quantitie of water, the licour therof in meaſure .ii. pintes, ſauyng the thirde parte of a pint, with hony & ſalt being drunken, ſhal profite moch. Cicer, & the pulſe callid in latin eruum, in engliſhe I ſuppoſe chittes) in water drunk faſting, hath the ſame effect. To them, which ſet lyttell by the ſaid tokens, theſe diſeaſes do ſodenly happen, Fluxe of the bealy, bluddy fluxe, ſlyppernes of the bowels, peines in the guttes, ach in huckle bones

the feuer tercyane, the gowte, the apoplexie or pal ſey in the lymmes, hemoroides, aking of ioyntes.
               Whan the bladder is towarde any ſickenes, it is perceyued by theſe tokens, fulneſſe felt after ly tell meat, brekyng wynde downewarde and vpwarde, paleneſſe of colour in all the body, heuy or troublous ſleapes, the vrine pale, and paſſinge forth peynefully, ſwellynges about the coddes & priuy members. Whan theſe tokens appeare, thā is it expediēt to haue remedy of odoriferous thinges, which do expell vrine, whiche ſhall be done without any peryll with the rotes of fenell & perſely ſtieped one or two dayes in good whyte wyne and to drinke therof faſtinge euery mornyng thre ounces and two drāmes, with the water of wilde carettes, or elycampane, which of theſe is next at hande, euery of them haue lyke effect. Alſo water, wherin the peaſyn called in latyne Ciceres, are ſtieped, beynge drunke with wyne, is lyke commodiouſe: he that neglecteth the ſayde tokens, let him loke for theſe ſyckeneſſes folowynge, the dropſy, the greatnes of the ſplene, griefe in the lyuer, the ſtone, ache of the backe, or peynes in the raynes, the difficultie of vrine, fulneſſe of the bely. In all theſe thinges that we haue ſpokē of, we ſhal gyue to childrē moſt eaſy medicines, to men thoſe, whiche be ſtronger in workynge.
               This diete of Diocles, although at this tyme it ſemeth not moſte pleaſaunt, nor accordinge to the practiſe nowe vſed, yet beynge tempred with that, which I haue before remembred, ſome thing

maye be founde in it, which beynge experienced, maye be as commodious for the helth of mās body, as that diete, which is morecuryous or pleaſaunt.
            
            
               Of them in whoſe ſtomakes meat is corrupted. Cap. xi.
               THey in whome cuſtomably meat is corrupted, let them afore that they eate any meate, aſſay to vomyte, drynkyng ſwete wyne, abſteyne frome meat, that ingender botches, inflammations, fumous ructuations or vapours, and take ſuche as nouryſh good iuyce, and choſe them out, which do mollify the bely, & at ſondry tymes take them. It is alſo good to take temperatly y• which lowſeth the bely, as the medicine called picra, and to abſteyne from ſuche thinges, wherby yll iuyce is gathered, and do ingender ſyckeneſſes, harde to be cured or neuer, as goutes, boneache, peynes of the raynes &c.
            
            
               Of the vertue of meates. Cap. xii.
               HE that is ſtudyous aboute the conſeruation of healthe, he nedeth to knowe the vertue of meates. The meate whiche hath vertue to Oribaſius de medici na ſimpli. extenuate, or make humours ſubtylle, it openeth the poores, and bryngeth forthe that whych is faſte in the fleſſhe, it maketh that whyche is clammye, ſubtylle, and doeth extenuate, or

relent that whiche is fatte, it bringeth forthe that whiche abideth longe in the bealy, but that which is eaten, is a ſuperfluitie watry and colerike, and at length maketh melancolyke bloud. Wherfore moche vſyng of them is prohibited, ſpeciallye to them; that are colerike, and only ſerueth for them that are replete with fleume, crude or vndigeſted humours, clammy or fatte. The diete of fattinge thinges, dothe nouriſhe abundantly, ſoo that the ſtomake and lyuer do digeſt well: meate of good iuyce, maketh good bloude, but yet it ſtoppeth the lyuer and ſplene. Theſe do they, whiche make fat humours onely, as the poulſe callyd Lenticula, and they that are ſlymy lyke malowes, ſome do make fat humours, & be alſo ſlymy, as fiſhes with hard ſhelles. Fynally the diete, whiche doth extenuate and make leane, is more ſure for kepyng of helth, than that, whiche fatteth moch. Noriſhyng meates wold be therfore moderately vſed, whan a mā perceyueth hym ſelfe to haue nede therof, it may be moſt ſurely vſed of them that be exerciſed temperately, and can ſlepe whan they lyſt. They that can not ſlepe by reaſon of exerciſe, lette theym eſchewe fattynge meates, lette none ydelle perſone attempte to vſe theym. In the preſeruation of helth, ſluggardy is the greatteſt miſchiefe. Like as the temperate mouing is good, ſo is the meate whiche betwene thycke and thynne, is to mannes helth moſt conuenient, which ingendreth bloude, according to the competent conſtitution of mans body, & therfore is it to be chiefly vſed. Meate of

yll iuyce is alway noyfull, wherfore it ought to be eſchewed. Lykewiſe the varietie of meates is to be obſerued diligently, for it is a great thynge to couple wel togither thinges of contrary vertues. for if they be not well digeſted, that whiche is receyued, may bring diſpleaſure.
