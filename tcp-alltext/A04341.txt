Iames Student in Diuinitie, and keeper of the publike Librarie at
Oxford, for reformation of the ancient Fathers VVorkes, by

                  WHEREAS the Workes of the ancient Fathers, and holy Councels, haue of late yeares beene moſt

Church of Rome to the maintenance of Poperie and ſuperſtition, is their ſundrie Iudices Expurgato

Copies of or from the printed Bookes.
            3 In this collation or comparing of Copies, they may obſerue this order preciſely, to take for printed Copies the laſt of the
Proteſtant and Popiſh Editions: for the Manuſcript or written Copies, to procure or get into their hands as many as can conueniently

            4 Amongſt ſo many written Copies, they ſhall chuſe out foure of the moſt auncient and approoued Bookes, which ſhall bee
exactly compared with the two before mentioned printed copies of the Fathers: the diuerſe readings ſhall be noted in the margent
of one of the printed Bookes. In places of greater moment and conſequence in Religion, they ſhall conſult all the auncient
Copies, though they be neuer ſo many.

and charges in buying the Workes of the Fathers againe, it may be ſo ordered, that as ſoone as the collation of any of the Fathers
Works ſhall be finiſhed, & renewed by the beſt Diuines, there ſhal be preſently printed an Index in octauo, or quarto, which ſhal
ſhew the corruptions of the printed copies of either Papiſts or Proteſtant Editions, which haue beene very lamentably abuſed
in this kinde by too much truſting of the Papiſts.
            10 The Manuſcript or written copies, which ſhall be vſed in this Collation, ſhall after the collation is ended bee preſerued, with
all poſsible diligence and care, either in the priuate Libraries, of Colledges, & Cathedrall churches, or elſe in the publike Libraries
of both our Vniuerſities, as well for a perpetual Monument of this their paines taken: as alſo and eſpecially for the further manifeſtation
of their truthes and honeſties in this behalfe. So that if any Papiſt ſhall queſtion, the readings thereof, he may ſee the

            11 Laſtly, for the antiquitie and veritie of the written Copies which are with vs at this day extant in England, in great ſtore:
