Chriſtians.
               
                  VVHen the Gentiles
heard the Law,
they gaue this teſtimonie
of the Iewes, in that behalfe,
                  Deut. 46. Onely this people
is wiſe, and prudent. No
maruell: for,
                  Pſal. 19. 7. The Law
giueth wiſedome to the ſimple.
Pſal. 19. 7. It is perfect: ForDeut. 6. 25.
it is our righteouſneſse before
the Lord.Pro. 3. 8, 9. It is alſo
plaine to him that will vnderſtande.
Then ſeeing
theſe Lawes are
                  Deut. 10. 4. Tenne,
andDeut. 5. 22. God added no more:
Deu. 12. 32. Neither must we put
any thing to them. Euery
                  Pſal. 119. 96. Commandement muſt of
force be exceeding broade.
The meanes to vnderſtand
their breadth, Moſes
hath ſet downe, when
he ſayd:
                  Exod. 20. 1. Then GOD
SPAKE all theſe wordes.
               The word, SPEAKE, is
to proclaime with maieſtie:
when then hee
ſpake All; there is like
maieſtie in All. Then,
what maieſtie is in any
one Commandement, is
to be tranſlated into euery
one of the reſt. Remember
to keepe the Saboth: yea
we muſt remember to
keepe euery Law. Haue
no other Gods before his
face: yea, do all that is
right, and no euill in his
ſight. Honour thy Father
and Mother, that thy dayes
may be longs yea, keepe all
the Laws, that thy dayes
may be prolōged. Once
in deed, in the Law, for
breuitie is ſet one maieſtie,
where ſooneſt it
would be miſſed: not for
once; but to be trāſlated
into euery one, as Moſes
doth, where he expoundeth
the ten Commandements.
For the eaſe
of thoſe that hunger after
righteouſnes, I haue
digeſted the Commanmentes
in this Table.
Meditat, & ſo may you
profite, that you may
(in a maner) reduce the
whole morall ſcriptures
to theſe ten Commandements;
not without
a ſingular delight to
him that loueth knowledge.
Enioy this, and
ſtudie it a while; and
ſhortly (God willing)
I will further helpe you
herein, by a moſt familiar
explanation.
               
                  Chriſtes vnworthie
miniſter, that deſireth
your edification.
