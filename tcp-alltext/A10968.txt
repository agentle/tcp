            To Miles Mosse, Minister of the Word, and Bacheler of Diuinity
            
            
               Miles Christianus wisheth more soundnes of iudgement, more substance of learning, with more wisedome and discretion in all his actions.
            
            
               YOu haue published of late, Maister Mosse, à little Treatise entituled, A short Catechisme, &c. you fore-saw I doubt not, whither it shoulde go, from what, into whose hands it would come, how many eies woulde see, and how many eares heare it, and heare of the same: and therefore vpon mature deliberation (for may I thinke otherwise?) you commended it (yet the worke of other heads) and your selfe withal (the corrector and abridger thereof) with many titles and notable words vnto the present age, and posterity to ensue. Of which Booke I haue nothing, or verie little, but of the Preface, or dedicatorie Epistle of yours (which I woulde to God had neuer beene written, or more Christianly, soberly, and aduisedly penned) I haue many thinges to say.
            Nowe that you may perceiue my quarrell against you is iust, not picked by mee, but ministred by your selfe, I haue sette-downe all your wordes, without either adding vnto, or taking from them any whit: and where you

say well, you shall haue the praise due for good deseries, but where you haue slidde from the truth, and broached vnsound and noisome assertions, I haue both laide them open, and confuted them also, for your owne good, if admonished you will see your faultes, and reforme your iudgement; and for the common benefit of our Church and Countrey, to whose seruice, I haue dedicated my selfe and studies.
            And this haue I donne (as hee knoweth to whome the verie ground not of mine onely, but of your writing also is knowen) not of any setled ill-will to your selfe, to whome I wishe all good, but through an vtter detestation of your Paradoxes, which neither for mee had beene confuted in an open booke, had not they by your selfe to the great dishonour of God in a publike writing, and vulgar tongue both in Towne and Countrey, beene dispersed.
            I am no aduersarie to your person, but to your opinions, which if you change, I am changed; if not, assure your selfe to heare that you would not, when you will persist to holde that you should not maintaine.

                        THere is no end of making many books, said the Preacher: and he said truely: and his ende in saying so was excéeding good, and neither to discourage men from wry

                  Indéede the varietie of matter and inuention in all ages hath beene wonderfull: yet can you not saie, and say truely, it was without measure, vnlesse you condemne simply the varietie of wits, and inuention, which are the worthie giftes and graces of almightie God, bestowed vpon man, nor that this varietie of matter and inuention hath bene manifested in all ages by written bookes. For both the heathen people were a long time without the benefite of bookes, and the Iewes, and Church of God, till Moises daies (which was many ages from the creation of the world) vtterly voyde of all helpe of the written word. And saie you not your selfe within a few linesContrariety. after, the writings of the ancients were few? If fewe, how were they without measure? And if beyond all measure, againe how were they few?
                  Last of all, interpreting the saying of the Preacher so as if he spake onely of this present age, and latter time wherein we liue, you mistake him much. For albeit he foresawe the multitude of writings that were to come abroade in the latter daies, yet, no doubt, he ment properly the writings which he saw were attempted in his daies, or extant in the world afore his time, which neither can be said to ouerflow, or to haue ouerflowed the bankes of modestie and discretion, because there be multitudes of them: that is no sufficient cause, yea no cause at all. Of good thinges the moe, yea the greater multitudes, the better, and there be multitudes of writings, which you dare not without impudencie auouch to haue ouerflowed the bankes of modestie and discretion. And of such bookes it is not the iniquitie, but the felicitie of the latter time to haue good store.

                  You write your pleasure of all writers both ancient, and of this time: but vntruely of each, vnsoundly of all. And that you maie palpably sée and perceiue both the truth of mine, and the falshood of your wordes, I will before your eies place some propositions pregnantly arising from your verie spéech.

                  You do no sooner sée this, but me thinkes, the red colour commeth into your chéeks. Were the writings of the ancients but few? What ancients meane you that were but few? The Schoole-men and others, immediately afore our time, or the Fathers, and other writers afore them? Or the Apostles, Euangelists, prophets afore them? Or the Ancient Heathen, whether philosophers, orators, historiographers, or poets? If you meane the Schoole men, and our immediat predecessors, read our countrie man Bale, onely for English writers, I. Bale de Scrip. Anglicis and he will confute you: If the Fathers of the Church, read Gennadius, 
                     Gennadius de illust. viris S. Ierome,

                  This is vntrue, if you meane generally all the Ancients, if some of them, it is also vntrue in many respects, vnlesse you vnderstand by Ancients onely the ancient Prophets, Euangelists, & Apostles, the very penners of the Canonicall Scriptures.

I tolde you also of one librarie that had in it at one instant foure hundreth thousand volumes of seuerall writings. Can you name, I say not that man which of Grammer, but that man which of any matter within this age hath written & published seuen thousand bookes, or so much of his owne doing as no one man in his whole life is able to peruse? And where in England, yea in all Christendome will you finde in one Librarie, I had almost sayd in all the publike Libraries fowre hundred thousand bookes, as was in that one at Alexandria? And that at such a time as there were not so notable meanes by printing spéedely to spread abroad and disperse the labors of men, as now in these dayes? And yet is it true that the writinges of these dayes be manie, and of the Ancients, fewe?

&c. therefore the writings of this time do disturbe the Church, and fome out their founders shame? Do you so malice, or detest some, that because of them which you like not, you will vtterly condemne all, as did Herod all the Infantes of two yeares old and vnder, because he hated Christ Matth. 2, 16? Or rather thinke you in good earnest, that the writings of this time disturbe the Church, and fome out their founders shame? If you thinke as you write, most wicked you of all men, that so doe thinke: worser, that so dare write: If you thinke not so badly of the writinges of this present time, as you doe write, then dissembler you that write otherwise then you thinke, and of all most foolish, that no better doe consider what you doe write?
                  I thanke God, Miles, I haue receiued that swéetenes and profite by the writings of this time, that I thinke it no small portion of happinesse both of this time to haue them, and of mine to heare and read them, and can not with patience endure to heare them so in publike writing defaced. And therefore in the zeale and courage of a Christian Souldier I write it, and write vnto you, either reuoke these wordes, and giue a better testimonie of them by whom both you, and the whole Church is the better, or assure your selfe you will heare of this Hereticall blasphemie, where and when you would not.

                  If the Heathen Philosopher liued, which inhibited his Schollers the first seuen yeares from speaking: how sharply would hee censure manie hastie heades of our dayes, which take penne to write, before they knowe to speake, I say not learnedly as Schollers, or religiously as Christians, but sensibly as men of reason and vnderstanding.
               
               
                  Miles Christianus.
                  These wordes be yet more moderately spoken than the former: howbeit not truely neither, vnlesse you vnderstand them of publike writers. Now if any thing come abroad that is so

farre from being learnedly and christianly, that it is not sensibly done, the boldnesse of them is great that so dare write, but the negligence of them greater that should, and will not eyther restraine such workes before they come abroad, or punish the authors for publishing their follies. And an heauie account are they to make which either diuulgate, or suffer any thing to come abroad vnlesse it be both sensiblie, Christianlie, and in some measure scholerlie performed.
                  I am a plaine fellowe, Miles, and get not my liuing by dissimulation, I tell you as I thinke, had some men done their partes this Pistle of yours had neuer come abroad.
               
            
            
               
                  Miles Mosse.
                  The Apostles rule is quite forgotten, Be swift to heare, and slowe to speake: and men are become like windie instruments, readie to speake as soone as they receiue breath, though they giue an harsh & vncertaine sound: whereof it commeth to passe, that many read much, and learne little, because many that know litle, haue presumed to write much.
               
               
                  Miles Christianus.
                  The Apostles rule is quite forgotten, you say: but you haue quite forgotten your selfe in saying so. His rule is both known and practised of some, or else you condemne euen all the Militant Church in this worlde: but of some, indéede, it is better knowen then practised, and of some so forgotten, as if it had neuer bin knowen, the more is the pittie.
                  In these wordes you note thrée sortes of men, Speakers, Readers, and Writers: the first, that will speake before they haue learned: the nexte, that reade much, and learne little: the last, that knowe little, and yet presume to write much. Nowe had you as wisely, as you haue roundly deliuered your minde, your wordes had béene to be accompted of, but séeing you so write of all thrée, as no man can tell against which, or what,

or vpon what ground you write, blame me not though I doe déeme you none of the wisest Writers. And be your selfe iudge whether you were with or besides your wits when thus you wrote. And mē are become like windy instruments, ready to speake as soon as they receue breath, though they giue an harsh & vncertain soūd. Wherof it comes to passe, that many reade much, & learne litle: bicause many that know little, haue presumed to write much. All out of iointe. The first sentence agréeing nothing with that going afore in your Epistle, in which you spake wholie of writing, and in that of speaking: the nexte answering nothing vnto the other, where you enter into the speach both of reading and writing, and vtter nothing of speaking, and yet all so with Coniunctions either copulatiue or causall are linked together, as if they depended directly one thing vppon an other, when they do nothing lesse. You are not to write against vnsensible Writers, that write so without sense and reason your selfe. Howbeit, whatsoeuer your deliuerie be, your meaning is to point at the corruptions of Speakers, Readers, and Writers in this age. And surely, I commend you for your integritie in this respect that you will not so write against one, but you will also by the way speake of other faultes. Yet two thinges I cannot but mislike in you, one is, that you delight so in Generalities, that what is the true sense and meaning of your wordes cannot be vnderstoode: which is surely a great fault in a Writer (a speciall grace of writing being perspicuitie) the other is, that vainely, I will not say enuiously, you speake of some things as faultie, when they are not so. But you shall sée your selfe.

                      you meane Preachers, yet not all, but some who are become, you say, like windie instruments, readie to speake as soone as they receiue breath,

though they giue an harsh and vncertaine sound. Which, had you vttered plainely, as you doe it as other things, couertly, you had spoken well, and with commendation, for there bee such indéede, and they deserue to be touched, and sharpely to be taken vp. Against whome, as well as your selfe, I coulde say much, but I spare them at this time in some respects. Many good men crie out of them. There is little difference betweene some of our Sermons, and the bare reading of ignorant Ministers, saith one T. W. Vpō certaine verses Rom. 8 p. 11.. Such crie out for a learned Ministerie, themselues being vnlearned, saith another T. C. In his admon. to the people of Eng. 1. 47.. There be too too many, who to auoide the infamie of vnpreaching Ministers, are bold beyond their strength to fly without wings, to the great dishonor of the name of God, offense of his people, and incouragement of the aduersaries of his trueth, saith a third Sophronistes.. Nominatim aliquos referre possem, saith Melancthon 
                     Ad Matt. Sideman▪ epist.. So saie I, some such I coulde name: and I coulde name some, otherwise of name, who, not because they want learning, but for that they are too carelesse and negligent, handle the worde but too vnreuerently. Such men, though they preach much, yet they profite little, nay, doe great hurte by their example. The yong Cocks learne of the olde to crowe.

                  Miles Christianus.
                  Them which reade much, and learne little, blame not: For Learning, whether it be great or small, is no reproch. It is the greater praise I grant, to reade much, and learne much: yet are they praise-worthie that learne anie thing, though it be but little, by their reading.
                  They which reade much, and learne little, are to be praised, and pittied: praised, for their painefull reading, pitied, because they reade and profite no more. Yet are they not to be dismaied from reading, but to be incouraged thereunto, and withall, aduised in their much reading, to vse more diligence.
                  
                     If many that reade much, learne litle, I maruell how many which reade litle, can learne much: he can neuer be well learned, which is not wel read.
                  Blame them not which reade much, but blame them who haue no care to reade. It is no fault to reade much, but to reade litle or nothing, if we can and may reade, is an hainous fault.
                  I wot well, a man may be a good christian, though he can not, and therefore doe not reade. For, Rom. 10. 17 
                     Faith commeth by hearing ordinarily, and not by reading: yet can I not sée without a miracle, howe any man can prooue a good diuine, without good reading. The same Spirite that saith

                  They doe wel then that reade much, but they which can and may, and ought, and yet will not reade, and reade much, offend the Lord. God in his righteous iudgement giueth those men vp many times to folowe the fancies of their frantike braine, because they like better of their owne idle speculations, then to be conuersant in the writings of holie men.
                  Neuer looke that our Church shall be frée from these hostile dissentions, till either manie that preach much, do reade more, or they of the Ministerie which reade much, be the Preachers.

                  It is of Writers as of Speakers many times, the more ignorant, the more impudent. The emptiest vessels make the lowdest sound: and the Parrat will prate when the Nightingale wil not sing.
                  Those men that will either speake or write before their time, I mislike and condemne so much as your selfe.
                  Of idle we haue but too much, but of learned and godlie writings, we haue but too few, and can neuer haue too much.
                  It were a golden world, if men would do that good vnto the

Church and Common weale which they are bounde. The worlde is not of golde nowe, but of earth. Séeing the best learned in these daies take not the most pains: and good men, though of inferior giftes, doe their best indeuours to doe good, be thankefull vnto these, by whome you do or may reape commoditie, but blame those for not doing their partes.
                  He is a foole that will no siluer because he can get no golde: & they are no wise men that despice the meane graces of God, (if any grace of God be meane) séeing they can haue no vse of the best mens gifts, or more truely of the more notable giftes in worser men. For I count him the best man, not which hath the most and best giftes, but which imployeth his talents to the greatest aduantage of his Maister.
                  And take héede how you despice any wisedome and knowledge offered you from the Lorde, by a man whose learning is but litle, & his writing much, or because a man knoweth litle, and yet writeth much, except you can showe that his knowledge or writing is not syncere. Least by the iudgement of the Almighty (who euen so punisheth commonly as wée do offend) it come to passe, that you be despiced your selfe, séeing other mē of greater learning, and more giftes, are either silent, or more sparing of there spéech then your selfe. Which that you may auoyde, make more pretious accompt of them which write much, though they know litle, their litle knowledge for substance being the knowledge of Gods Church, and their manifold writings consonant vnto the holy Scriptures.

If such you meane, then know you that you are not the first, nor alone in so doing. For many mislike them so well as your selfe.

                     It was not the will of Christ that his Church should rely vppon paper writings, nor that hys mysteries should bee committed to parchement: plainly showing that the Apostles sinned in writing as they did. For they did more then they were enioyned to doe, and contrary to the will of Christ when they occupied themselues in writing, whereas they would haue preached much, (after his ensamples) and written nothing.

                  The Ministers of the worde that bee writers at this day, though they may be many, I grant, if you set them apart by themselues, yet are they fewe, very few, euen too few in comparison of those Ministers, which eyther preach, but write not, or neither preach, nor write. I am sure you can not reckon of an hundred one Minister, that taketh paines in writing, and call you those many?
                  
                  
                     Not to speake of other places, the state of our Church for publique writers, is reasonably well knowen vnto vs both, and know we so many Ministers that be writers in the same? He is a friend of ours that was woont to say in his Sermons (which I haue not heard a great while) that your Townsmen of Burie are such diligent hearers of the word on the Monday exercises, that they may easely be singled-out from other men: surely the writers of our Church all of them may easely be singled, and numbred, they are not so many (and yet too many by some, like your selfe, vnlesse they exercise their stile in more necessarie matter than they doe).

                  Blame not Ministers for writing much, which in trueth is litle to that which both others afore them haue done, and they are bound vnto.
                  It is no reproch to our Church that any able men do write, but it is a great reproch that either there be no moe of them, or that they write no more.
                  And our Diuines haue a great account before God to make (so manie parishes remaining without preaching Pastors, and so many aduersaries on all sides arising to the great annoying of the whole Church in euery corner) that yet sit still beholding

the house of God miserablie wasting into ashes, partly by the flames of inward contentions, partly by barbarous ignorance, and will not set their handes to their bookes, and by their laboured writinges quench the same, and bring them out of danger that be readie to perish. But more to blame are you, and such as you are which neither doe good that way your selues, nor like of them which be industrious & painefull for the common good, but thinke that much (I am affraide too much) which is bestowed in writing.
                  Assure your self some Citizens, Physicians, Lawyers, Gentlemen, and Courtiers shall be renowmed in the Church of God, when a number of idle-bellied Ministers shall perish in obliuion. For they haue taken time frō their worldly affaires and pleasures to encounter with the Familists, Brownistes, Martinistes, Atheistes, the monsters of our daies, when these haue suffered them to rage and make their praie, either with none at all, or with colde resistance, they haue cut the throats of those spirituall Harpies, and brought them to their bane, when these haue either nourished or encouraged them by their silence.

                  If Ministers by their writing neglect not their dutie of preaching, produce them not as offenders eyther for their preaching or writing, whether it be much or little. If they do their partes, let their paines then in writing and preaching,

                  It is a praise for a Minister eyther to write or preach, if he can doe eyther and not both of them, but to write and preach too, as it is a double labour, so it deserueth a double honor: as neither to write nor preach (if men be not otherwise by the Church profitablie employed) is a double sinne, and so bringeth a double shame.
                  
                     Note them not, as faultie, that write much, & preach litle, but blame them which preach little or nothing, and plaie much.
                  Were some (whome I could name) in their studies writing, when they are either at the Pondes with their Spaniels ducking, or in the Allies with their mates, bowling: I am sure they would thinke them much iniured, that priuely, much more in publike monuments, are disgraced as faultie, which bestow that time profitably in writing for a generall benefite, which others bestow vainly (often times wickedly) for a short and priuate pleasure.
                  And yet is it an vntruth, that They which write much, preach litle. For howsoeuer it be true in some, which either will not, or cannot preach: (and I woulde to God, they which cannot do both, would yet do the one, and which cannot do the one, woulde do the other at the least) yet true is it not in all, nor in the most and best approoued Writers, who I am sure both ordinarily in their owne places euerie Sabbaoth day, and extraordinarily too, when either by authoritie or friends they are called forth, doe preach, and that as often, and as commendably as other men which doe not write, but onely preach. And they by good experience doe finde, that writing is no hinderance, but a furtherance vnto preaching.

And as he had not done his parte, if he had neglected either preaching or baptizing, so had he not done his duetie, if he had not written. For the same God which elected him to preach, and minister the sacraments, appointed him also to write.

                  I wot wel, as al the Disciples and Apostles were not, but some were: so are not all ministers of the worde, but some to write. Now when is not opportunitie offered to write? The ende of all writing is, either to instruct the rude, or to reproo

The more that either ignorance and wickednesse is rooted, and aduersaries doe arise, the more earnestly ought men to exercise themselues herein. If at any time, men haue no we both matter and occasions manifolde to imploy their gifts and talents for the publike benefite.

                  This is your conclusion, wherein you make a request, which is, that Your fellow Ministers would seriously consider, namely, how farre the liuely voice, that is, preaching, exceedeth the dead letter, which is, writing.
                  I also intreate your fellow Ministers, and your betters, and your inferiours, and your selfe, and all men to consider your wordes, and that seriously. For my parte I haue seriously considered of them, and I obserue some things in them worthy due and serious consideration.
                  First I note therefore that you so write, as if by euident demonstration you had prooued, that Preaching farre away surpasseth writing, whereupon you say, My fellowe Ministers therefore &c. which is nothing so, you haue insinuated such a thing, but not prooued it.
                  Nexte I note, that you, who so basely haue spoken of booksContrari

                  Other things are besides to be considered, which in the discussing of your assertions shall be reuealed.

                  Preaching doth farre exceede writing.
               
               
                  Miles Christianus.
                  He is verie blind, that séeth not, much vnthankefull, that will not acknowledge, most impudent, that dare denie the benefites of writing and preaching to be excéeding great: but whether that preaching excéedeth, yea as you affirme, farre excéedeth writing, and the voice of man the bookes written by man would seriously be considered.
                  For my part, I can not but thinke your position diuerse

wayes to be vnfound. For though some preaching excéedeth some writing: yet shall you neuer be able to proue that preaching simplie excéedeth writing. Nay, if you denie that some writinges, excéede for goodnesse some Sermons, you haue a face of brasse, and are againe contrarie to your selfe, who confessedContrarietie. afore, That men are become like windy instruments, ready to speake as soone as they receiue breath, though they giue an harsh, and vncertaine sound, which you can not affirme simplie of writings. For albeit some writinges, like this your Epistle, are windie, without substance, and some are vaine and erronious: yet all are not so. And those writinges that are studiously, and according to the prescript rule of Gods word, and of the commendable sciences exactly penned, must néedes be, not only equall, but farre more excellent besides than those Sermons which either be like windie instrumentes, and giue an harsh and vncertaine 
                           •
                        ound, or otherwise erronious.
                  And as some preaching is not better than all, but farre inferiour to some writing: so some writings are both equall to some, some better than many, some more excellent in some respects than all Sermons, and whatsoeuer procéedeth from the mouth, which you call the liuely voyce of man: and of this last sort are the written Sermons, and other bookes of the Prophets and Apostles, called vsually the holy Scriptures, whereby we are bettered when we are not by the liuely vey
                        •
                     e of those men, the Apostles I meane and Prophets, and wherby the controuersies of all times are to be determined, when they are not by the voices of any men, be they neuer so liuelie. Other writinges of holy and learned also in diuerse respects excéede preaching. For bookes will teach, and counsell, and comfort, and strengthen, and confute, and doe those and the like duties both for the instruction of the ignorant, conuersion of sinners, ouerthrowing of Heresies, when, and where, and in such sort as happely no man can, and some men will not, or dare not. And so writing is not alwaies inferiour, but sometime excéedeth, yea farre excéedeth preaching, vnderstanding by preaching the vtterance of Gods word and will by the liuelie

voice of an Ecclesiasticall and lawfull Minister: for otherwise the holy writinges of good men are verie preachings. And therefore well saide one (whom not your selfe onely, but the whole Church of God this day hath in honorable remēbrance) Paule did preach the Gospell also by writing, and the people did heare the Gospell by reading

                  My selfe though I haue alwaies desired to benefit the Church as I could, and haue found by experience, no one thing more necessarie for the benefit thereof, then a sufficient forme of teaching the principles of religion: yet to publish one of mine owne I durst not, partly, because it is a thing which craueth the consent of many, partly because the world is scarse able to containe the Catechismes alreadie printed.

                  Now you speake of your owne experience. We will therefore consider it the more seriously. But what is it which by experience you haue found out? Namely, that no one thing is more necessarie for the benefit of the Church, then a sufficient forme of teaching the principles of religion. This you speake of a publike wr

                  Now surely Maister Mosse, I would you knew your selfe. In the sentence nexte immediately going before, you intreated all your felowe Ministers, to consider seriously how farre the liuely voice, namely, preaching, doth exceed the dead letter,

                     oke your former saying, that Preaching doth farre exceed writing: for some writing is as necessarie for the benefit of y• Church as preaching. But if preaching doth farr excéed writing, then renounce this saying, No one thing is more necessary for the benefit of the Church, than a certain sufficient Catechisme. For if the one be true, the other must néedes be false. Againe, if true it be, that the liuelie voice exceedeth farre the dead letter: and a Catechisme, being a printed Booke, is but a dead letter, then true it is not, that a certaine prescribed Catechisme, which is a dead letter, is as necessary as the liuely voice, which is preaching: and if the liuely voice far excéedeth the dead letter, then is not a Catechisme, which is but a dead letter, as necessarie for the benefite of the Church as preaching, which is the liuely voice.
                  Hereof it followeth, that either in this you affirme more than euer you found true by your experience, or, in the other saide more than you could affirme by any certaine knowledge:

either your knowledge is better then your experience, or your experience to be praised before your knowledge. Either your experience is ill, and your knowledge good, when you say preaching dooth farre excéede writing, and the liuely voice, the dead letter: or your knowledge is not sounde, and your experience good, saying, that for the benefite of the Church, a certaine prescribed forme of Catechisme is as necessarie as preaching, and the dead letter as the liuely voice.

                  The consent of some, though they be many men, is no cause to vndertake such a worke, except that some be of auctoritie: the multitude of Catechismes is not let on the other side, but that one of many, or one Catechisme for all may be appointed to all and euery Church, by those that haue the gouernement of vs all.

                  This Catechisme you commend, first for the long time it hath continued in the Church, euen about these tvventy yeares. Next for the good approbation which it hath receiued from diuers, and they great diuines in the Vniuersity of Cambridge.

                  Since the publication hereof, it hath beene before this, foure times imprinted, which argueth the good approbation which it hath receiued, as well from those in authority, as from the particular Churches of this land.
               
               
                  Miles Christianus.
                  The praises of this booke haue not yet an end, but you further commend it from the often imprinting of the same. For since the publication thereof, say you, it hath beene before this, foure times imprinted. Be it so, which argueth, you say, the good approbation which it hath receiued asvvell from those in authority, as from the particular Churches of this land.
                  
                  But you are deceiued much. The often imprinting thereof doth no whit argue the good approbation which publique authoritie doth giue vnto a booke. I could name bookes vnto you (within lesse than twenty yéeres) foure times imprinted, which yet neuer by publique authoritie were approoued. It followeth not, A booke is often imprinted, therefore it is allovved by authority. You know, or at least may know, that Printers commonly doe gaine most by those bookes which are most forbidden. Whereby you may note into what a peruerse and froward generation we are fallen, wherein men most earnestly desire, though they buie thē most déerelie, the things which by wholsome statutes and Proclamations be most straightlie prohibited to be either bought or solde. I say not that this Catechisme is so. Yet must I tell you (howsoeuer you say it is by authoritie approued, because it hath béen foure times imprinted) I haue séene diuerse impressions of the same, & could neuer yet sée, as in authorized bookes (Seene and allowed, or any thing to that effect) till this last impression, and publishing thereof by your meanes.
                  Neither doth it followe, It hath béene foure times within these twentie yeares imprinted: therfore the particular Churches of this lande do approoue it. You are neuer able to prooue

that the particular Chuches of this lande haue approoued the same. I thinke your meaning is, it hath béene approoued by all because it hath béene taught in some particular Churches. Which is as weake an argument as the former. For the teaching of it in some, argueth not that it is approoued of all. Now vnlesse all haue approoued the same, neuer say, The particular Churches of this land haue approued it. And when our prudent Gouernors haue so approued, that they do commende it vnto all Churches to be taught, then as some few Churches alreadie, (by the toleration of our milde Gouernours) haue, so all Churches of this lande will in déede approoue the same. In the meane season you cannot but by Supposition, which is deceiptfull, say, that it is, or euer hath beene approued by the particular Churches of th

                  And yet it hath fallen (as it sometimes happeneth with a Trauailar) into the handes of euill companie. Some haue abridged it of the right: some haue bolstered it out with more than the owne. In both, they haue beene verie preiudicial to the authors.
               
               
                  Miles Christianus.
                  You haue shewed the good, now you declare the ill successe that this Booke hath found. And yet it hath fallen into the handes of euill companie, you say. If it haue done euil men good, it was wel for them, that it happened so: but il for it, if it haue béene abused in their companie.
                  But what hath fallen out? Some haue abridged it of the right: some haue bolstered it out with more thā the owne. In both, they haue bin verie preiudiciall to the authors. Had you showen either what they had left out, which should not be omitted, or what they had put in, ye might not be added, you had done well, and might iustly haue thought them preiudiciall to the authors, and euill men: but when you so say, and yet showe no fault, much lesse prooue their actions faultie, manie will thinke you preiudiciall vnto them, and an euil man, so to attaint them in a publique writing. The men are well

knowen to be better men then your selfe, and by their labor

                  Miles Mosse.
                  The thinges which I haue aimed at in this labour, are principalie two. The one is, more shortnesse in the answeres, for the capacitie, and memorie of the simple: and the other is, more direct and euident proofes of Scripture to the purpose. Questions and answeres I haue added none, more than I suppose them to haue beene entended of the first founders, or so necessarie, as they might not be omitted.
               
               
                  Miles Christianus.
                  But what hath your selfe done to the booke, if one may aske you? Haue you so published the same, as at the first by the Authors, the first founders, diuers great Diuines in the Vniuersity of Cambridge, it was published?

And is this all? No, you saie, For you haue added besides questions and ansvvers. Uerie well, then you haue both made some answers shorter, which were long, that is, Abridged, and you haue Added questions and answers too, that is, bolstred it out vvith more then the ovvne. Haue you thus done, by your owne confession, and blame you other men naming them Euil, and saying, they haue béene preiudiciall, very preiudicial to the Authors, and yet haue done but that which you haue done, and no more?
                  But you haue reasons for your doing. For you saie, that you abridged it for the capacity and memory of the simple,
                     
                     and inlarged it but by such things as you suppose vvere either intended of the first founders, or so necessary as they might not be omitted. And may not they where they abridged it, say also, they did it for the capacity and memory of the simple? and where they inlarged, that they either supposed their additions were intended by the first founders, or so necessarie that they could not be omitted? Be these reasons good, alleadged for your selfe? and be they not as strong, alleadged by, and for them? And then what praise purchase you, but they deserue the same? And why are they reproched as ill, doing but that which you did, and vppon so good groundes as you haue done? Is this wel done of you, & that ill done of them? Are they il men, doing as you do, & you a good man doing euen as they? Are they preiudiciall to the aucthors, and not your selfe? And let al men that haue iudgement iudge, whether that by your abridging and adding, you haue bettered, and not rather worsered this Catechisme, of so manie great Diuines of Cambridge, and whether it were not much better, both at the first, as the Authors did it, and since, as other men did publish it, then now.
                  You say, you haue aimed at more direct and euident proofes of Scripture to the purpose. I doubt not of that: but how wel you haue hit the marke let others say, I will not nowe vnfold. One thing only I wil tel you, & but the truth (as he knoweth, who knoweth all things) opening your booke (as our Sauiour did the booke of the Prophet Esay 
                     Luke 4. 17., I founde this question, What callest thou the Catholique Church? This answere, The Catholique Church the number of faithfull people, vvhich are, haue bene, and shalbe to the worlds end in all places, all vvhich are knovven to God, and cared for of men, These proofs Iob 10. 16. 2.

                  The first proofe Iob. 10. 16. is to show that the Catholike Church is the number of faithful people, vvhich are, haue beene, and shalbe to the vvorlds end in all places. I turned to that place in Iob, and I found the wordes to be these, But let it encrease: hunt thou me like a Lion, returne and shevv thy selfe marueilous vpon me. Here is no word

to the purpose, for which it is quoted. You made me to muse: but thinking it might be a fault of the Printer, and that Iob might be set for Iohn, I turned vnto the tenth of Iohn the 16. verse, where in déed our Sauiour Christ speaketh of his Church, and of one Church, and of the encrease and perpetuitie of the same. But by your leaue that place neither will proue that The Catholike Church is the number of faithfull people, vvhich are, haue beene, and shalbe to the vvorlds end in all places.

For then should manie which neither had, haue, or shal haue Faith, be excluded from the mysticall bodie, the Catholike Church of Christ, and yet both our Sauiour dyed, and shed his pretious bloud for them, and they were elected vnto life euerlasting, before the foundations of the world, so well as they which by hearing the word of God preached, hane attained faith (b).

For the holy Catholike Church, which vve belieue in our Creed, is not the companie of the Faithfull onely, but the whole company of Gods elect and chosen, whether euer or neuer they doe belieue.
                  
                  The second proofe, (2. Tim. 2. 19.) is truely quoted. But the third and last (Matth. 18. 14.) alledged to proue that the Catholike Church, as you say, the companie of the faithfull is cared for of men, is nothing so nor so. The wordes of S. Mathevv in that place be these, So is it not the vvil of your Father vvhich is in heauen, that one of these litle ones, should perish, where our Sauiour plainely sheweth that his prouident care is excéeding great euen ouer litle ones of this world, he saith not that men haue a care of his people, the litle ones of this world, or that they be cared for of man. But the contrary we may sée in the holy Scriptures. For the vvorld hateth them

                     Neither haue you misapplyed onely this text of Matthew, but ouer and that peruerted the good meaning too of the Authours. For where in the former editions, it is thus, I belieue that God knoweth them al, and hath a most tender care ouer them, which is very true, you set downe in yours, Al vvhich are knovvn to God, and cared for of man, the former of which is true, the latter most false. And yet are you a good man, and they ill? you a benefactour, and they preiudiciall to this booke? Fel it into ill company, when it came into theirs, and was it happy by lighting into your handes?

                  And in these I haue not trusted my self alone (because euery man aboundeth too much with his owne sense) but haue consulted with diuers godly and learned brethren, that two might be better then one, and a three-folde a

                  As you can not trust your selfe in your doing (if we may beléeue you): so, take you not the better héede, this and such other dealing of yours will make others warie how they trust you, and others in such actions. This is not the first time you haue ouer-reached your brethren, and made them to giue approbation to your deuises, of which both they and you may be iustly grieued.
                  It is now almost vsuall for cunning fellowes to circumuent their plaine meaning brethren, and make them doers of that, which themselues will not, or dare many times be séene in, or not alone.
                  You haue made your brethren accessarie vnto those faultes whereof I haue prooued you guiltie, by consenting vnto your action. For not the doers of euil onely, but they also which approoue the same, be culpable.
                  If you did amisse your selfe afore, the consent of diuers (how learned and godly so euer reputed) doth not good your fact, but aggrauate your offense. And therefore if you offended any

way, as you haue diuersly, both they and you haue much more sinned, you in getting, they in giuing their approbation vnto your doings,

                  Now this handfull of water I haue presumed to present vnto your Lordship: first, in regard of mine owne especial duetie. Secondly, because that the care of the principles of religion, lieth by right most weightely vpon the shoulders of the gouernours of the Church. Thirdly, that thus I and my brethren about mee, might as wee coulde, witnesse our thankful minds to your Lordship, for the freedome of our Ministerie, and the peace in our places, which hetherto we haue enioyed by your gouernment.
