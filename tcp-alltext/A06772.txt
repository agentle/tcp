of y• holy sciptures, which declare &
setforth vnto vs y• vnmesurable boūtie &
exceding large liberaliti of god toward
al thē y• cast their care on him, & trauaile
according to their vocaciō & calling, y• bi

not, but if they diligētly weigh & earnestly
pōder these cōfortable sētences &

only cease to attēpt any vnlawful meanes,
but thei also shal find great quietnes

lōg as they liue, liue wt a meri cōscience.
If I had bene as able to redresse y• miserable
state of y• pore wt worldly goods, as
my wyl is to stay their cōsciences wt the

must do yt I mai, whē I mai not yt I wolde,
laughing folish fortun to scorne wt al

               Here was Moses
chosen and appointed of god to be
the supreme magistrate and principal
gouernour of gods people.

And as he had here by gods commaundemēt
authoritie to rule, euē
so were the Israelites bounde by
gods worde to obey, which thinge
so long as they did, they ryght wel
prospered, they liued quietly, god
fauored them, Moses as a louing
father cherished thē. But whē thei
shoke of the yocke of obedience,
sought carnal libertie, murmured
against their magistrate, troubled

punishe and plage thē? The lorde

murmuring against Moses,
murmured against god, whose

It is not I that haue troubled

Israell, but thou and thy fathers
house, in that ye haue forsaken the
cōmaundementes of the lord, and
folowed the waye of Baall, as
though he should haue answered:
Doest thou O kynge, laye to my
charge, yt I troubled thy realme,
which teache thy subiectes to obey
the in all those thy cōmaundementes
that fyghte not wyth goddes

me. There is, I graunt, in thy
realme sedicion and muche hurlye

faute to me, but corie thy selfe on
the head, & saye: I my selfe and my
wycked progenitors, which haue
not tēdered the glorie of god, nor
loued to heare his blessed worde,
nor to maintaine ye preachers therof, but rather haue slayne them
and folowed the way of that foule
Idole Baall, and nouryshed hys
priestes at oure owne table, and

haue not ruled the Realme wyth
such iustice and equitie, with suche
clemency aud gentlenes, as becommeth

thys my Realme at this presēt is
so greatly dis quieted. As I maye
let pas the other Prophetes,Math. v whiche

Christ was here accused, the

Agayn when .s. Paule & Silas
came to Tessalonica,Actes. xvii. and .S.
Paul preached in the sinagoge the

passion & r

                  surreccion of Christe,
howe dyd certeyne of the Iewes
complain of them vnto the heades
of the Citie, and rushed into the
house of Iason thapostels hoste,
and violentlye plucked him oute,
saiynge: These that trouble the
world are come hither also, whom
Iason hath receiued priuelie. And
these al do contrarie to the decrees
of Cesar, affirming another kinge
one Iesus. Here are thapostels accused
both of sedicion and treason,
and yet wer they neither sedicious
persons nor traitours. They troubled
not y• world, except the world
here be taken for the deuelishe people
of y• world, to whō it is a trouble
to hear any thing of Christ, or
to heare their abhominable liuing
rebuked. The good people of the
world, they quieted & made thē mery
in their cōscience,

they perswaded by ye word of god,

which thapostels preached, y• they

                     •
                  iō of al their sinnes
thorow faith in Christes blud.
Thapostels did not cōtrary to the
decrees of Cesar, if they were not
against goddes worde, but rather
taught mē to obei thē. And though
thei preached Iesus to be a kyng,
yet dyd this nothing derogate Cesars
honor, for they taught Christ
not to be a temporal, but a spiritual
king, not to rule with sweard or
polare, but with his spirit & word,
not to reigne in Princes palaces,
but in the hertes of the faythfull.
Is not here great sedicion, greate
treasō?Acte. xxi. Whē .s. Paul was but sene
at Hierusalē in the temple how cried
the iewes out, saiyng: O ye men
of Israel, help: this is the mā that
teacheth al mē euery wher against

                   him, & wold haue slaine him

if the hye captaine had not come.
What had Paule offended? He
spake nothing, he did nothing, bu
                     •
                  
as other Iewes dyd. It was
inough to kyll Paule, because he
was that Paule which had preached
Christ to be the sonne of god.
At another time when he tolde the
Iewes, that god appointed hym
to be a teacher of the Gētils, how
lifted they vp their voices, saiyng.
Away wyth such a felow from the
earthe,Actes. xx

shoulde liue. Paule muste dye,
because at the cōmaundement of
god he turneth the Gentiles from
Idolatry to the true worshipping
of god. And as the wycked world
linges cruelly entreated the Apostels
of Christe, so doe the worldly

of people is farther from doynge

neither doth a cōmō weale receiue

sermons of Nohe, they had not perished
with waters. If the Sodomites
and gomorianes had harkened
to the sermons of Loth,Gene. vii. ii. Pet. ii. they
had not ben consumed with raine,
fyre and brymstone from heauen.

If the Israelites had geuen eare
to the warninges of the ProphetsGene. xix.
they had not so ofte be plaged and
led awaye into captiuitie. If the
iewes had receiued the doctrine of
Christ and his Apostles, they and
their citie with all their posteritie
had not come to such a destrucciō.
But when the lord rayseth vp his

               Well, thus se ye it is
no new thing for godly preachers
to be sclaundred & burdened with
those fautes, wherein they be nothinge
gylty.

               I haue heard it
reported, y• diuerse Gentlemē haue
ben y• occasiō of al these tumultes
and sedicions thorow the great oppressions
and wronges that they
haue done to the

                  , as
by making cōmon pastutes seuerall
to them selues,Of gentlemen by enclosinge

more ground to their own vse, thē
heretofore hath bene accustomed,
and by this meanes take away the
necessary fode from the pore mens
cattell, without the which they can
not lyue: againe, by gettynge so
manye farmes in to their handes,
and letting out their owne landes
vnto their tenauntes and farmers
for so great pryce, or els take such
large fines and greate incommes,
that they cā neuer liue of it. These
& such lyke thinges haue I heard.
            
            
               Phil.
               Ye haue heard my mynde of
preachers, which were sclaundred
(I speake of the godly) in this behalfe.
I wyl now speake sumwhat
of gentlemen. As I do not alowe
al that be called preachers, so do I
not approue the doinges of al thē
that be called gentlemen. And as
I do not condemne all preachers,
so do I not dispraise all gentlemē.
For as they are, whiche are trewe

preachers in dede, so lykewyse are
ther whiche are true gentlemen indede.
But some abuse the name of
preachers, by teaching papistrie, a
nabaptistry, Epicurisme, &c. & are
no prechers in dede, but rather praters
& deceiuers of the people: so
lykewise are ther many which are
called gentlemē, & are no gentlemē
in dede, but pollers and pillers, rakers
and catchers, bribers and extorcioners,
yea and very caterpillers
of the commō weale. For they
abuse the name of a gentleman,
whiche is vnfeynedlye a name of
muche worship and great honour,
and worthy to be had in reuerence
and hye estimacion. Wythout the
true gentlemā the common weale
can no more safely be, then the bodye
wythout eyes. For as the eyes
are the principall co
                     ••
                  forte of an
whole bodye, so lykewyse are the
true gentlemē of the cōmon weale.

And looke what the nose is without
smellynge, the tonge without
speakyng, the handes wythout feling,
the feete without goynge, the
very same is a cōmon weale without
them that are true gentlemen:
as the wiseman sayeth.Prou. xi Where no
good councell is, there the people
decay, but where as many are that
can geue good counsell, there is
wealthe. For suche as are true gentlemen,
are fathers of the contrey,
mainteiners of the pore, defēders
of the widowes & fatherles, socurers
of ye nedy, conforters of the cō
                  fortles,
& vpholders of the cōmon
weale, in fine, gentlemen bothe in
name & dede. These be pearles &
iuels to a realme, & as necessari for
the cōseruaciō of a publike weale,
as fyre, water, and heate is for the
health of mans bodi. For their pricipal
respect is not vnto their own
priuat lucre, & singular cōmoditie,

but their whole study is how they
maye profite the cōmon weale and
do good to many, as Salomō sayeth:

                     
                        〈…〉
                     
                   the ryghteous laboreth to do
good, but the vngodlye vseth his
encrease vnto sinne. Not onli their
goodes, but theyr verye lyfe also
wyll they bestowe to do good to other,
so farre is it of, that for their
owne aduauntage they wyl enpoueryshe
or hinder any man.
            
            
               Euse.
               Wolde god we had many such gē
                  tlemen.
            
            
               Phi.
               We haue without all
doute many, although not so many
as I wolde wyshe, for of good
thinges we cā neuer haue inough.
Then is there another sort, which
glory in the tytle of gentlemen also.
And they are suche, as this cō
                  mō
prouerbe noteth: As ryseth my
good, so ryseth my bloude. They
thinke al nobilitie to consist in the
abundaūce of worldly goodes, in
wearinge of golden cheines, and

costly aparel, in hauing faire houses
and pleasaunte gardens. And
to set forth this their gentlemāry,
they poll they pyl, they wake they

                     •
                  ake, they sweate they freate, they
gripe thei nipe, thei face thei brase,
they semble they dissēble, yea they
moue euery stonne, as they saye, to
maintaine and set forth their vnnoble
nobilitie, not caringe howe
they come by it, so they haue it. All
is fyshe that cometh to the nette:
it is good to be takinge. Bonus est
odor lucri ex re qualiber. These studye
not as the true gentlemen do,
to profite many, to do good to the
contrey, to maintaine the poore, to
relieue y• socurles, to nourishe the
weake, to cherishe their nedy tenaū
                  tes,
neither seke they the cōmodity
of the cōmon weale, but their own
priuat aduauntage. They labour
to posses much,Eccle. iii but thei distribute
nothing. Their hande is stretched

out to receiue, but shut when they
shoulde geue. If they once exe
                     •
                  pe
in to a towne or vyllage, they for
the mooste parte neuer ceasse, tyll
they haue deuoured and eaten vp
the whole toune. What soeuer is
pleasaunte or profitable, muste be
theirs by hoke or by croke. It lyeth
handsomlye for them & so nere
their nose, though it be a myle of.
If there be either farme or shepeground,
vpon the which some honest
pore man liueth, both he and
his familie, oute he muste. Had it
must be whatsoeuer it cost, though
the pore man & all his should go a
begging, it lyeth so cōmodiouslye
for our newecome gentleman. If
they bye any tenement, & let it out
againe to the pore man, O how do
they racke it, and stretche out the
rentes therof, almost from a peny
to a pounde? yea and some of them
biynge house and land in a toune,

suffer the houses to falle downe,
and turne the grounde vnto pasture,
the poore man not hauynge
where to hyde his head. Who wyl
be troubled, say they, wyth suche a
sorte of shake ragged slaues in a
towne, whiche do nothinge but
burne vp oure hedges, eate vp the
common, fyl the towne full of beggers
braules? Who? No man I
trowe, namely where such fine and
longnosed gentlemē dwell. Some
biynge the lordeshyp of a towne,
handle the inhabitauntes thereof
on such sorte, that they lose diuerse
of theyr liberties, beynge in much
worse case then they were afore.
Thus ye pore people be so wroūge
of these vngentle gentlemen, yt the
selye soules are lyke vnto dry haddockes.
Some Irishe men beholdynge
them, myghte well thynke,
that they came latelye oute of
Saynte Patrickes pargatorye.

They are so wythered awaye euen

Agaynst suche churlyshe gentlemē

ye plucke of mens skinnes and the

ye chop them in peces as it were in

               These gredy gripes,
and hongry horseleches, by vsurpinge
the name of gentlemen, do
muche obscure the renowne, worship
and honour of true gentlemē,
and cause the name of a gentlemā
to be muche disdained amonge the
cōmon people, as wee haue bothe
heard and seene now of late daies.

And thoughe they chalenge to thē
                  selues
neuer somuch the name of a

auncestoures, by antiquitie, by the
worthines of their stocke, and many
god morowes, yet if they do degenerate
and growe out of kynde
from the natural maners of a true
gentleman, they are no gentlemen
in deede, but carles & churles, yea

they are tirantes and murtherers,Eccle. xxxiiii.

bothe ryche and galauntlye appareled,
sayde: Here is a horse trapped

hym to be a gentleman, but his

                  er the bellye

she shuld neuer haue inoughe, and
therfore continually knocketh at
the doore of the mynde, to putte
him in remembraunce to prouide
for her, saiyng: Adfer, Infer, bring
hither, bringe in. For the idle belly
continuallye consumeth, wasteth,
but getteth, prouideth nothinge.
Therefore is she full of thoughte
and care for her liuynge, euen as a

beggare is, whiche is so ielouse ouer
hys drynke, that he wyll not
suffer the lytle flye to sitte vpon
the brymme of his cuppe, leste she
should beguyle him of his drinke.
Thys belly care causeth the Lawers

though they haue neuer so manye

the sea soner be without water and

perishe for honger. If god prouided

proued true in Isahac. phil. Not in
Isahac onlye, but in so many as euer
obeyed the voyce of God, and

braynes do nowe a daies, leauinge

Neyther ought men to doubte, but
that god whiche is almyghty, and
able to do what soeuer hys good
pleasure is, wyl as wel prouide for
them at home in their poore cotages,
as in the haulles of Princes.
The blessinge of the lorde maketh

it doth nothing therto.

               When
Isahac sent his sōne Iacob to Mesopotamia,Gene. xxviii.
y• he might take to wife
one of y• doughters of Labā, Iacob
as he passed forthe on his iourney,
made a vow, & sayd: If god wyl be
with me, & wil kepe me in this iourney
which I go, and wyll geue me
bread to eate & clothes to put on, so
y• I come againe vnto my fathers
house in safetye, thē shal y• lorde be
my god, & this stone which I haue
set vp an ende, shall be gods house,
and of all that thou shalte geue me
wyll I geue the tenthe vnto thee.

Here Iacob desireth gods assistēce
in his iourney, that he may go and
come safe. And as touching worldly
goodes, he desireth no more but
foode and raiment. And so nothing
douting of goddes helpe, he goeth
forward on his iourney according
to the cōmaundemēt of his father.
Nowe behold the louing kyndnes
of god toward Iacob. God which
neuer leaueth them socourles that
calle on hys holye name, appeareth
vnto Iacob in his slepe, and
promiseth that he wyl geue him &
his seede the lande that he slepeth
vpon, and that his posteritie shall
be great and many, that they shall
be as the dust of the earth, and shal
spread abroude to the weaste, to the

               Ye shal
heare. Wher as Iacob desired god
to be with him, and to kepe him in
his iourney, god sayd vnto him on
this maner: Behold I am with the
and wyll be thy keper in all places
whither thou goest, and wyl bring
the againe into this lande, neither
wil I leaue the vntil I haue made
good al that I haue promised the.
According to goddes promise Iacob
had a prosperous iourney trauailynge
into Mesopotamia. Of
whose cōminge, when Labā heard,
vnto whom he was sente of his father,Gene. xxi
                        •

not only sende him bread & clothes

                   prouidence & singular liberalite
toward his seruauntes, y• we
mai learne perfectli to hāge on the

lorde our god. Ye reade in the first
boke of Moses, that in the time of
Iacob whom we spake of a litle afore,Gene. xli.
there was a great dearth in al
contreis, in somuch that in the lāde
of Canaan there was no vitaile to
be gotten for money. Now behold
the prouidence of god. God aforeseyng
this plage of famine, to the
entente that his seruauntes shulde
not peryshe in tyme of honger for
lacke of fode,Gene. xxxvii. wonderfully sent Ioseph
afore into Egipte. And although
his brothers solde him in
to a straunge land, by this meanes
sekyng his destruccion, yet god turned
thys his seruitude vnto his honour,
and the euel that they dyd to
theyr brother, vnto their profite,
wealthe,Gene. iiii. and commoditie. For god
exalted Ioseph, and set vp his honour
aboue all the lordes and princes
of Egipte: euen nexte vnto the
Kynge was he in dignitie, in somuch

that he hadde the rule of all
the kynges dominions, & did what
semed him good in his owne eyes,
such fauour founde he in the syght
of the kynge thorow goddes working.
Now when this dearth was
also felte in the lande of Canaan,
and Iacob wt his familie in great
daunger thereof,
                     
                        •
                     ene. xlii. Iacob hearinge
that corne was to be sold in Egipt
(for thorowe Iosephes wisedome
was there corne inoughe layde vp
in the store houses of euerye Citye

                  t die. To be
short, seyng the historie is knowen,
when the sonnes of Iacob came thither
for vitaile, there was Ioseph
their brother in hie authoritie, whō
they iudged eyther to be dead, or
elles to liue lyke a bonde slaue and
drudge, not able eyther to do him
selfe good or any other. In fewe,

they had vitailes home with them,
and their money also, with manye
precious gyftes, and at the laste a

fetche Iacob and all his familie,
and bad them not regarde theire

lande of Egypt. And all this came
to passe by the prouidence of God,
whiche afore seynge thynges to
come, worketh wonderfullye for
the sauegarde and healthe of hys
seruauntes.
               
                  
For the cause that Iacob and hys
chyldren found such fauour in the
syght of kynge Pharao, was not
fortune, nor chaunce, but goddes
prouidence: againe, that Ioseph
was exalted vnto such dignitie, the
cause thereof was not Iosephes
fayr face, nor yet his goodly personage,
but gods good wyll, whiche
gaue him suche wisedome, as none
had the lyke in all Egipte, neither
was there any in al the dominions

of kynge Pharao founde lyke vnto
Ioseph, whom the kyng might
make gouernour ouer his realme.
And al these thinges wrought god
for the preseruaciō of his seruauntes
as Ioseph himselfe said to his
brethren:
                     
                        〈◊〉

whom you solde in to Egipte.
Nowe therefore be not greued therwyth,
neyther let it seme a cruell
thinge in your eyes that ye solde
me hither. For god dyd sende me

before you into Egipte for your
wealth, and to saue your liues. For
this is the second yere of dearth in
the lande, and fyue mo are behind,
in whiche there shall bee neyther
earing nor heruest. Wherfore god
sente me before you to make prouision,
that ye myght continue in the
earth, and to saue your lyues by a
greate deliueraunce. So nowe it
was not you that sente me hither
but god, which hath made me a father
vnto Pharao, and lorde of all
his house, and ruler thorowe oute
all the lande of Egipte. God hym
selfe also spake vnto Iacob in a vision
by nyght, saying: I am god,
the god of thy father, feare not to
go doune into Egipte, for I wyll
there make of the a greate people.
I wyll go doune wyth the into Egipte,

to their desire for his promyse

And he that gathered a litle, gathered
ten homers full. And they
spred them abrode rounde aboute

Nowe marcke what followeth. As

god prouided meate for the Israelites,
so in lyke manner suffered
he them not to go naked, nor to
peryshe for colde, but all that tyme
of fortye yeres, when they were in
the wyldernesse, he so preserued
their clothes, that they waxed not
olde, and soo saued their shooes
that they were not worne: but both
garmentes and shooes so whole at
the fortie yeres ende, as they were
at their fyrste comminge into wildernes.Deu. xxix.
I haue led you forty yeres
in the wyldernesse, sayeth god: and
your clothes are not waxed olde
vpon you, neyther are the shooes
of your feete, worne. Ye haue eaten
no breade, nor dronke wyne,
or stronge drynke, that ye mighte
knowe that I am the Lord youre

fed the wyth Manna, whiche neyther
thou nor thy fathers knew of,

to make the to knowe that man
dothe not lyue by breade onlie,Deute. viii. but
by euerye word that procedeth out
of the mouthe of the Lorde, doth a

not olde vpon the, neyther did thy
foote swell those fortie yeres. Here

socourles▪ sayd to Elias,
vp and get the to Sarepta, whyche
is in Sidon, and dwel ther, beholde
I haue commaunded a widowe
there to sustayne the. So he
arose, and went to Sarepta. And
when he came to the gate of the citye,
the wydowe was there gatheryng
styckes. And he called to hir
and sayd: fet me I praye the a lytle
water in a vessel, yt I may drincke.
And as she was goyng to fet it, he
cryed after hir, and sayd: Brynge
me I praye the a morsell of breade
also in thyne hande. She sayd: As
trulie as the Lord thy God lyueth
I haue no breade redye, but euen
an handefull of meale in a barrell
and a lytle oyle in a cruse. And beholde
I am gatherynge two styckes
for to go in, & dresse it for me &
my sonne, that we may eate & dye.
And Elias sayde vnto hir: feare
not, come and do as thou hast said,

but make me thereof a lytle cake
fyrste of al, and bringe it vnto me,
and afterwarde make for the & thy
sonne. For thus sayeth the Lorde
God of Israel: the meale in the barel
shal not be waked, neyther shal
the oyle in the cruse be diminished,
vntyl the Lord haue sent raine vpon
the earth. And she dyd as Elyas
sayd. And she and hyr house did
eate a good space, and the meale
wasted not out of y• barrel, neyther
was the oyle spent out of the cruse
accordyng to the word of the lord,
whych he spake by the hand of Elyas.
Here agayne ye se what prouysyon
God made for Elyas, and
howe benefycyall he also was to

               These be comfortable histories

whom for the moste part the
wycked and vnthanckefull world
neglecteth, despyseth & set noughte
by, yea and maketh les prouision
for them, then for theire malte horses
and bandedogges. Here maye
the true Prechers se, yt althoughe
the world regardeth them nothing
at all, and suffereth them so muche
as in them is, not onlye myserable
to lyue, but also to peryshe for honger,
yet God, whose ministers they
are, whose worde they preache, wyl
not suffer them extremelye to wāt,
but wyll eyther wonderfullye fede
them hym selfe, as he dyd Elyas,

or elles store vp some good Abdie
to make prouision for thē, as this
Abdi dyd for the Prophetes of the
Lorde, when they hyd them in the
caues from the tirāny of quene Iesabel,

               We reade also
that a certeine womā of y• wiues
of the Prophetes came vnto Heliseus
the Prophet,iiii. Reg. iiii. declaringe vnto
him, that her husband was dead, &
that for dette which she ought and
was not able to paye, the creditour
was come to fet her .ii. sonnes to be
his bond men. This woman was
a Prophetes wyfe. Her husband is
dead, which lefte her both pore and
in dette. Comforte hathe she none,
but only the cōpany of her .ii. sōnes
which also the creditour wold take
awaye and make his bonde men,
because she is not able to discharge
the dette. O in what miserye is
this carefull woman? She hathe

nothing at al in her house, but a pitcher
of oyle. But what is that to
the dispatche of the dette. And if
that be gone, there remaineth nothing
wherof she & her sonnes may
lyue. What is then to be done?
               Det must be payed. Her substaūce
wyl not reache so far. To make her
childrē bond slaues, shuld be to her
present death. This therfore remaineth.
The sorowfull widowe lamē
                  teth
fyrst of all her cause secretly in
her hert vnto god, which is the helper
and patrone of all true wyddowes
and fatherlesse children, and
afterwarde vttereth the same to Elizeus
the Prophet of god, whiche
thorow gods blessinge of one pytcher
of oyle, filleth so many emptie
vessels ful of oyle, that she sellinge
part of the same, was not only able
to paie her dettes at the vttermost,
but also had inough of the reste to
fynde her and her children.

               This womans
husbād was a Prophet, and
feared the lorde, therfore could not
she and her children remaine longe
confortles. For god hath promised
to be a husband to suche widowes,
and a father to suche godlye mens
children.Psal. xxxvii. I haue not sene the ryghteous
forsaken, nor their children
begging their bread on the earthe,Psal. cxii.
sayth the Psalmographe. Againe:
Blessed is the man that feareth the
lorde, he hath great delyght in his
cōmaundementes. His sede shal be
myghtie vpon earthe, the generacion
of the faythfull, shall be blessed.
Riches and plenteousenes shall be

               This is a
confortable historie for suche godly
womē as are christen preachers
wiues. Hereof may they learn, that
though theyr husbandes be neuer
so poore, when they departe out of
this world, yet if they remain faithful,
and in the feare of god, and diligently
call on his blessed name in
their aduersitie, he wyll neither suffer
them nor their children to lacke
necessaries for their liuinge, but by
one meanes or other sende them all
good thinges, so that they shal not
wante.Iosu. i. I wyll not fayle the, nor yet
forsake the,Psal. clv. sayth god. The lord geueth
meate to the hongry.Psal. xxxiiii. Beholde
the eyes of the lorde are vpon them
that feare him, and vpō them that
trust in his mercy, that he may deliuer
their liues from death, and nouryshe
them in the tyme of honger.
God despiseth not the desire of the
fatherles nor the wydowe,Eccle. xxxv. saith the

wyseman, when she powreth oute
her prayer before hym. Dothe not
god se the teares that runne downe
the chekes of the widowe? or heateth
he not the cōplaint ouer suche
as make her to wepe? For frō her
chekes do ye teares go vp vnto heauen,
& the lord which heareth them,
doth accepte thē.
            
            
               Phil.
               At a nother
tyme also we reade, yt thaforesayd
Prophet in the tyme of dearth fed
the Prophets childrē,iii. Reg. iii
                        •
                     . & with a few
loaues norished a great number of
men, in somuche that they dyd not
only eat inough, but also left much
of ye bread, so greatly was it multiplied
thorow ye blessing of god, which
is able of a lytle to make much,
seyng of nothing he made al. Geue
vnto the people, yt they may eat, sayeth
ye Prophet. The minister answered:
What, shulde I set this before
an hundred men? Set it before the
people, sayth he, and let them eate,

For thus sayth the lord: They shal
eate and leaue. And he dyd set it before
them, and they dyd eate and
leaue accordyng to the word of the
lorde. Se ye not here, what the blessyng
of the lord is, and how al thinges
increase and abound,Psal. cxlv. when the
lord openeth his hande? If we depend
on goddes goodnes, he wyll
surely increase our vitayle in our
store houses, vpon our table, yea
in our mouthes and bellies.
               The Prophets seruaunt though
it not possible, that so great a number
of menne coulde be sustayned
wyth so fewe loaues.Math. xix. But that
whiche is impossible with menne,Marke. x.
is possible with god.Luke. xviii.
               
               Who therefore wyll doubte anye
more of goddes liberalitie, haue
he muche, or haue he litle? It is
all one before God to feede wyth
muche, or to feede wyth lytle.
               
                  
If god blesse vs, we can not want,
but if Gods blessinge be taken frō
vs, we muste nedes peryshe.
            
            
               Euse.
               So sayth the Psalmographe:Psalm. iiiii. All
creatures depende vpō the O lord,
that thou shuldest geue them their
meat in due time. For thou geuing
it them, they take it, and thou opening
thy hād, thei are wel satisfied.
But yu hidinge thy face, they are sorowfull,
& thou taking away theyr
breth, thei are but dead, and turned
into the earth, that they came of.

mowers, & caried him by the herre

of the heade, and thorowe a myghty
wynd set him in Babilon, vpon
the denne, wher Daniel was? So
carye thy meate, saythe the Angel,
that thou haste into Babylon vnto
Daniell, whyche is in the Lyons
denne. And whan Abacuch
eryed and sayde: O Daniell thou
seruaunte of God, haue take thy
breakefaste, y• God hath sente the.
Daniel answered: O god hast thou
thought vpon me? well:☜ Thou
neuer fayleste them that
loue the. What a lyuely exāple
is this of gods singular prouidēce
and fatherly care, whiche he hathe
for his seruauntes? Notable and
worthy to be written in letters of
golde, is this sayinge of Daniel.
Thou neuer faylest them
that loue the.
            
            
               Chri.
               This historie
is very confortable for al thē
that suffer inprisonment for the glorie

of god, and the confession of his
truth. Hereof may they learn, that
god wyl not leane them socourles,
nor destitute of help, as Dauid sayeth:
The lorde is my lyght and my
health,

                     al. xxvii. whō then shal I feare? The
lorde is the defender of my lyfe, of
whom then shal I be afraid? Whē
mine enemies came vpon me to eat
vp my flesshe, they stoumbled and
fell. Therfore thoughe an host of
men were layd against me, yet shal
not my hearte be afrayde, yea and
thoughe there rose vp war against
me, yet wyll I put my trust in him.

lefte,Iohn. vi. as filled twelue baskets full.
At a nother tyme, when the people
hadde bene with Christ thre daies,
and were readye to departe, hauynge
nothynge to eate, and some
of them hadde farre to go, so that
if they had gone awaye wythoute
meate, they shulde haue faynted by

on the people, saythe he, because
they haue continued with me

departe fastyng, leste they peryshe

And whē his disciples sayd: whēce
shuld we get so muche bread in the
wiloernes, as shuld suffice so great
a multitude, & tolde him that they
had but seuen loaues, and a fewe
lytle fyshes, he cōmaunded the people
to sit doune on the ground, and
toke the seuēloaues and the fishes,

and the disciples to the people, and

And yet they that did eate wer .iiii.

               This is a confortable

historie for all them that loue to
heare the worde of god, & to frame

Such may be sure not to want the
liberalitie of god in theyr necessitie,
which,i. Timo. vi. as S. Paul sayeth, geueth
vs all thinges abundauntly to enioye

princelyke Prophet,Psal. xxxiiii sayinge: The

from them? Yea rather dyd

And when they had fylled euen vnto

want nothyng, which haue Christ

               This historie

persons, which mary in ye lord.
Al such that so mary, & continue in
the feare of god, may be sure, that
the water in their welles shal soner
be turned into wine, & the stones of
their walles in to bread, & the claye
of their flores into meat, & ye thatch

               Agayne,Math. x. how dyd our sauiour
Chryste prouide for hys disciples,
when he sent them forth to preach,
without money or meat? as he him
selfe sayeth in the gospell of Luke.Luke. xxii.
When I sent you without wallet,
and scryp and shoes, lacked ye any
thynge? And they sayde: No. The
disciples accordinge to their vocacion,
wente forth and preached the
gospell, nothynge doutyng but he
that sente them, wolde prouide for
them. For what maister can fynde
in his hert to se his seruātes lacke?
            
            
               Chri.
               Thys is verye confortable
for the true Preachers of goddes
word. Herof maye they wel be asserteined,
that if they do their masters
message faythfullye, they shall not
wante, though the wycked worlde
be neuer so vnthankeful and nyggardely
vnto them.
            
            
               
               Phil.
               O how confortable are these
wordes of our sauioure Christe to
a faythfull christen man:Math. vi. I say vnto
you, be not carefull for the lyfe,
what ye shall eate, or what ye shall
drinke, nor yet for your body, what
ye shal put on. Is not the life more
worthe then meate, and the bodye
more of value then raymente? Behold
the foules of the ayre, for they
sowe not, neither reape, nor yet carye
into the barnes, and yet your
heauenly father feedeth them. Are
ye not muche better then they?
               Whych of you (thoughe he tooke
thought therfore) could put one cubite
vnto his stature? And whye
care ye then for rayment? Consider
the lylies of the fyelde, howe they
growe. They labour not, neyther
spyn. And yet for all that I say vnto
you, that euen Salomon in all
his royaltie was not arayed lyke
vnto one of these. Wherfore if god

so cloth the grasse, whych is to day
in the field, & to morow shal be cast
into ye furnace, shall he not muche
more do ye same vnto you, o ye of lytle
faith? Therfore take no thought
saying: what shal we eate, or what
shall we drinke, or wher wt shal we
be clothed? After all these thinges
seke ye gētiles. For your heauēly father
knoweth that ye haue nede of
all these thynges. But rather seke
ye fyrst the kyngdome of god, and
the ryghteousenes thereof, and all
these thynges shall be caste vnto
you. Behold what goodly and natural
examples our sauiour christ
bringeth forth here, that he may allure
vs to truste only on gods prouidence,
& not to be carefull for the
necessaries of this lyfe, whych are
not gotten by painful trauaile, but
receyued of gods mere liberalitie.
And because we shuld not be careful
for meate, he first setteth before

our eies the foules of ye ayer for an
example, whō seing god the father
feedeth so plenteouslie yt they want
nothyng, when they neyther sowe
nor reape, nor cari in to the barnes,
muche more wyll he feede vs, and
sende vs what soeuer is necessarie
for the preseruacion of thys our naturall
lyfe, if we call on hys holye
name, and lyue accordynge to our
vocacion. If he fedeth the byrdes
because they be hys creatures, whiche
notwythstandyng so once dye,
that they neuer lyue after, muche
more wyl he prouide for vs, which
are not only hys creatures, but also
created after his owne Image,
endued wyth an immortall soule,
and made vnto this ende, that we
shulde set forth his glorye, prayse
hys blessed name: and after the generall
resurreccion, our bodies and
soules beyng knytte together, liue
wyth hym in glorye worldes wythoute

ende, as hys lawefull heyres,
thorow Iesus Chryste our Lorde.
And as touchynge oure apparell,
to disswade vs from thoughte takynge
for that, he byddeth vs consider
and diligentlye marke the lylyes
and floures of the field, which
although they neyther labour nor
spynne, are so clothed wyth fyne
and pleasaunte coloures, that not
Kynge Salomon in all hys royaltie
and glorie was apparelled lyke
vnto one of them. If God so decketh
the transitorie flower, whyche
thys daye is in the fielde pleasauntly
growynge, and to morowe shall
be cut downe and caste into the furnace,
howe muche more wyll he
sende vs conueniente apparell for
oure bodies, whyche thoughe they
once dye, yet shal they ryse againe,
and for euer lyue wyth God in eternall
glorye?
               
                  
Christ therfore concludeth, that all
these thynges shal be cast vnto vs,
if we seke the kyngdom of god and
the ryghteousnes therof. Lette vs
seke heauēly thinges, and thynges
worldly shall abunde vnto vs. Let
vs labour to garnishe our mindes
wyth vertues, and god wyl not suffer
our bodies to peryshe for lacke
of transitory thynges.Psal. cxxxvi. For god is
the lorde which geueth meate to al
fleshe.Psal. cxlvii. He geueth, as the Psalmographe
saith, fode to the cattel, and
fedeth the yonge rauens that call
vpon hym. He fedeth ye Turke, the
Saracen, the Iewe, and all the rable
of Infidelles for their creacion
sake, and for his mercies sake. He
therfore wil not leaue them that be
hys faythfull people vnprouided,
socourles and destitute of help. He
geueth the vyle wormes of ye earth
not only theyr beyng, but also wher
of to lyue: he therfore wil not se the

faythful man lacke, which is made
lyke vnto hys owne similitude and
image. Let vs therfore neuer despayre
eyther of fode, or of apparel.
God gaue vs the lyfe, god wyl preserue
the lyfe. God gaue vs the bodie,
god wyl clothe the body. Away
therfore wyth carefull pensiuenes,
and pensyue care. Let vs cast oure
eyes on gods most holy and infallible
prouidence, which is certeine
and neuer fayleth.Luke. xii. Take hede and
beware of couetousnes, sayth oure
sauiour christ, for no mans lyfe stā
                  deth

               Therefore Chryste saythe:Math. vi. Take
no thought. He sayth not, laboure
not. The pensiue care and thought
takyng for our liuyng, wherwyth
the Heathen be so greatly disquieted,
we must caste away from vs,
and laie it vpon God, which careth
for vs: but as for labour, whych is
layed vpon vs of God as a Crosse
for oure synne, and disobeience in

Adam, we may not refuse, euery mā
in his vocacion, but ioyfullye take
it vpon vs, and geue god thankes,
that by suche meanes without our
care and thought takyng, he wyll
fede vs accordynge to his worde.
For what are all oure paynes, labours,
and trauailes, if god blesse
them not?sal. cxxvii. as the Psalmograph sayeth:
Except the lord build the house
their labour is but lost that builde
it. Except the lord kepe the citie, he
watcheth but in vaine that kepeth
it.
            
            
               Chri.
               Me thinke the occasion of
thys dearth, wherwyth we are now
oppressed, is not so greatly to be ascribed
vnto the couetousnes of certeine
gredye gripes, as vnto oure
owne selues, vnto our vngodlines
and dissolucion of lyfe, whiche so
lyue, as though there were no God
at all, so behaue oure selues, as
thoughe there were neither heauen
nor hell. They whych haue the gospell

swymminge in their lyppes, so
liue cleane contrary to the doctrine
of the gospell, as though ther were
no gospell at all. In ambicion, in
pride, in couetousnes, in enuye, in
malice, in wātonnes of lyfe. &c. thei
geue place to none. Another sorte
are so drowned in papistry, in supersticion,
in hipocrisie. &c. and burne
wyth suche an immortall hatred againste
gods worde, that they can
neyther abyde that (otherwyse then
it shall serue their phansie) nor the
preachers of it, nor yet suche as a
uaunce it. Can God do any otherwyse
then sende his plages, where
such impiety & vngodlines reigne?
It commeth from gods great mercies,
that we be not consumed, and
handled as Sodome & Gomorre.
But our owne damnacion slepeth
not, if we do not bothe shortly and
earnestly repente and amende.
            
            
               Phil.
               Trueth it is in dede, that god

many times sendeth the plage of famyne
into the worlde for sinne,
as it came to passe in the tyme of
that moste wycked an idolatrous
kynge Achab, and at diuerse other
tymes.

                     ute. xxviii. And Moses that most excellente
Prophet of God, sayth: If
thou wylte herken diligently vnto
the voice of the lorde thy god, to obserue
& do al his cōmaundemētes,
whych I cōmaunde the thys daye,
the lord wil set the vp on hie aboue
all nacions of the earthe. And all
these blessinges shall come on the,
and ouertake the, if thou wylt herken
vnto the voice of the Lord thy
god. Blessed shalte thou bee in the
towne, and blessed in the fieldes.
Blessed shall be the frute of thy bodie,
the fruite of thy grounde, and
the fruite of thy cattell, the frute of
thy oxen, and thy flockes of shepe.
Blessed shall thy almerye bee and
thy store. Blessed shalte thou bee

both when thou goest out, and blessed
when thou comest in. &c. The
Lord shal commaund the blessinge
to be with the in thy store houses,
and in all that thou setteste thyne
hande to. &c. The Lorde shal make
thee plenteouse in goodes, in the
frute of thy bodye, in the frute of
thy cattell, and in the frute of thy
grounde. &c. The Lorde shall open
vnto thee hys good treasure, euen
the heauen, to geue rayne vnto
thy lande in due ceason, and to
blesse all the laboures of thyne
hande. &c. But and if thou wylte
not herken vnto the voyce of the
Lorde thy god, to kepe and do all
his cōmaundementes and ordinaū
                  ces,
which I cōmaunde thee thys

vpon the, and ouertake the. Cursed
shalte thou bee in the towne, and
cursed in the fielde. Cursed shall
thine almery be, and thy store.
               
                  
Cursed shall the frute of thy bodye
and the fruite of thy lande be, and
the fruite of thy oxen, & the flockes

                  hepe. And cursed shalt thou
be when thou goeste in, and when
thou goest out. And the lorde shall
send vpon the famine, honger and
goynge to naught in all thynges
that thou settest thine hand to, vntyll
thou be destroyed and brought
to naught quyckely, because of the
wyckednes of thyne inuencions, in
that thou haste forsaken the lorde.
And the heauen that is ouer thy

Lorde shall turne the rayne of thy

muche sede out in to the fielde, and
shalte gather but lytle in: For the

Esai also saythe:Esai. i. If ye be louynge
and obediente, ye shall eate
the good thinges of the earth. But
if ye bee obstinate and rebellious,
ye shal be deuoured with the swerd.
For thus the lorde hath promised
wyth his owne mouthe. These sentences,
with many other in the holy
scripture 
                     •
                  d
                     •
                   euidentlye shewe, that
the plage of famine and honger is
sent vnto vs of god for our sinnes.
            
            
               Euse.
               It is conuenient therefore,
that we all harken to the admonicion
of God geuen by the Psalmographe,Psal. lxxxi.
whyche is, that there be no
straunge God amonge vs, nor that
we worshyppe any other God, but
hym alone, whych only is the lorde
our god that deliuered vs oute of
the spirituall Egipte, that is, from
the seruitude and tirannye of Satan.
If we so do, God promiseth
that he wyll geue vs what soeuer
we aske of hym. He wyll feede vs

wyth the finest wheat floure, yea &
satisfie vs wyth hony out of the stonie
rocke. But to obteine of God
this abundaunce & wealth, we may
worship, and haue no straunge goddes.
These straunge & new founde
gods, are not only idolles and maumettes
made of wood or stone, whiche
in tymes past the simple and folyshe
ignorant people worshipped
as gods, but the abhominable vices,
whych reigne so comonly nowe
amonge vs, I meane couetousnes,
pryde, ambicion, glotonie, lecherie,
malyce. &c. These are straunge
goddes. These muste we put oute
of our breastes, if we wyl haue god
mercyfull and liberall vnto vs.
               For is thys reasonable for vs to
serue straunge goddes, and to geue
ouer oure selues as bonde slaues
to them, and yet to requyre our wages
and rewarde of the true and onlye
liuynge God? What felowship

hath righteousnes wyth vnrighteousnes?ii. Cor. vi.
What company hath light
with darkenes? What cōcord hath
Christ wt Belial? Either what part
hath he yt beleueth with an infidel?
How agreeth the tēple of god with
idolles?Roma. vi. Know ye not saith .s. Paul
how that to whom soeuer ye cōmit
your selues as seruaūtes to obey,
his seruantes ye are to whō ye obei,
whether it be of sinne vnto deathe,
or of obediēce vnto ryghteousnes?
Euery one yt doth sinne, is the seruāt
of sinne,Iohn. vii
                        •
                     
                   saith Christ. We must
first of al be gods seruantes, before
we flatter our selues wt the obteyning
of the good thinges promised
by god, or elles we deceiue our selues.
If we be once the seruantes of
god, and faithfully continue in his
seruice, then maye we be bolde to
axe of hym oure wages, and to perswade
oure selues, that all the confortable
Histories and sentences,

whych we reade in the holye scriptures,
perteine vnto vs, otherwyse
we haue no more to do wyth them,
then the Turcke or the Iewe. And
if we receiue anye good thynge at
the hande of god beyng not his seruauntes,
we receiue it as all other
Infidelles do, vnto our damnaciō.

               I confesse neyghbour Eusebius
all this to be true, whyche you
haue now spoken. Neyther meante
I by talking so much of gods gentlenes
and liberalitie, & by alledgeynge
all these confortable histories
and sentences, to stablyshe the Idolaters
in their Idolatrie, the wycked
in their wyckednes, the couetous
worldlynges in their couetousenes,
the proude in their pride,
the lecherous in their lecherie, the
idle bellies in their idlenes. &c. and
yet notwythstanding to loke for
al those good thynges at the hand of
god, whych belonge vnto his sernauntes,

as he wytnesseth by the
Prophete,Esai. lxv. but to declare for your
conforte and myne, that so manye
as geue them selues ouer to God,
beleue in him, feare him, serue him,
and lyue accordynge to their vocacion,
shall neuer peryshe for honger,
but at all tymes haue what soeuer
is necessarye for them. And if
any shuld chaunce to famishe (whiche
seldome or neuer happeneth)
God suffereth them so to do, partly
that he may the soner call them vnto
hys glorie, partelye, that their
death maye turne vnto the greater
dampnacion of suche vnmercifull
monstures, as suffered the seruauntes
of god to peryshe for honger.
            
            
               Theo.
               We knowe your godlye entente,
brother Philemon, neyther
doth our neyghboure Eusebius otherwyse
take the matter. And I
for my parte thanke you ryght her
tely for your godlye admonicions,

frely confessinge that I am muche
edified by your talke, and strongly
enarmed agaynst the dartes of pouertie
and honger, when soeuer thei
shall go aboute to oppresse me.
            
            
               Christo.
               We all confesse no lesse.

               I spake that I spake, to this
ende, that men shulde not flatter
them selues wt the swete & confortable
promises of god, when they lyue
in all wyckednes, and abhominacion,
whych promises perteyne not
vnto them, but vnto the faythefull
seruauntes of god, whych shall enioye
no lesse at the hande of god,
then he hath promised. If they wyl
enioye the lyke commoditie, they
must do the like seruise. Thei must
away with their straunge and new
founde goddes, I meane, pryde, couetousenes,
gluttonie, whoredome,
malice. &c. and serue the onlye true,
and liuynge God.
            
            
               Philemon.
               Well
neyghboures, to knyt vp our talke

wyth fewe wordes, ye haue hearde
howe beneficiall God is to them
that put theyre truste iu hym, and
lyue accordyng to theire vocacion:
so that those that be faytheful nede
not to despayre of comfort, seme the
scarsenes of thynges so greate, that
it bryngeth presente deathe almoste
wyth it. For in that dearthe and
penurye, the faytheful man that casteth
hys care on God, and hangeth
wholly on hys fatherlye prouidence,Psal. xxii.
maye well saye wyth the
Psalmograph. If I walcke in the
myddes of the shadowe of deathe,
I will not be afrayde of any euell,
for thou arte wyth me. God is euer
present wyth hys people in al their
tribulacion,Psal. xci. & he wyl vndoubtedlie
delyuer them, & saue them harmles.
Thys nowe remayneth, that when
ye come amonge the poore neadye
Christians, ye conforte them wyth
these swete scriptures that ye haue

hearde, which wythout all doubte
shal greatly stirre and quiete their
myndes, and refrayne them frome
attemptyng any vnlawful redresse
of thynges after this. Agayne, accordinge
to your habilitie, releue
their pouertie wyth your ryches.
               Exhorte your ryche neyghboures
lykewyse to be beneficiall to the
poore, as the faythful stewardes of
God, remembrynge that vnto that
ende god hath endued them wyth
theyr possessions. Praye vnto god
that he maye geue vnto the couetouse
worldlynges, a merciful and
liberall herte, that after thys they
maye no lesse wyllynglye seeke the
profite of their neyghboures, then
hytherto they haue soughte theyr
owne priuate lucre, and singulare
commoditie. To conclude, pray vnto
god, that euerie one of vs maye
so lyue, and so frame our lyfe according
to his wyl, that he may vouchsafe

to blesse vs, and send vs necessaryes
for our liuyng, that we may
the more frelye, and wyth the more
quiete mindes, serue him in holines
and ryghteousnes all the dayes of
oure lyfe.Luke. i. Well neyghboures, I
praye you take the paynes to come
into the parlour wyth me. Ye shall
take your parte of suche homelye
fare as I haue. And I praye yon
be no straūgers: The ofter ye come
the more welcome shall you be.
            
            
               Euse.
               We thanke you moste gentle
