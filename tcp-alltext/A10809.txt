               LIke as the Load-ſtone pointeth at the immoueable poles of Heauen, and will not lye ſtill otherwiſe: ſo true generous and noble mindes euer ayme at vertue, and eſteeme their noble houſes by them halfe ſtayned, vnleſſe in valorous proweſſe, wiſe policies, and kinde courteſies, they equal themſelues to, (if not ſurpaſſe) the moſt famous of their Progenitors, yea of all whereof memoriall is extant: by which their worthie endeuors they liue in moſt great honourable reputation in this world, and after do liue by fame euerlaſtingly. Among which famous worthies, this Edward of Lancaſter here mētioned, deſerueth not the leaſt praiſe or priſe. And if any will alleage, that in this Poeticall praiſing of him, there be many fictions (as, Poetis et pictoribus permagna conceditur licentia) let ſuch learne to reade theſe manner of bookes, as Socrates wiſhed women to vſe their looking glaſſes; namely, fairewomen, to look on their glaſſes, to beware that their good maners may ſhine as well as their beautie; and

               How Argentino conſorting with a Knight of her Countrey to make the Ladie Vallia away, who aſſailed her at Sea, and what chaunced her.
               
                  THe prince, whoſe loue Argentino, daughter to the Thracian King by all meanes ſought to obtaine, burned in ſuch iealouſie and hate, wanting her deſire, that all her mind and ſtudie was, by ſome death or other, to quite her of her ryuall, the louelie Ladie Vallia, thinking thereby to gaine the loue of her knight, which we

Of this knight, her thoughts aſſured her: wherefore, caſting from her all regarde of honour, required in ſuch of ſo higheſtéeme: ſhe ſent for the knight, commanding her meſſenger to haſt him vnto her preſence. In which, no time was delaied of either part. For the Meſſenger no ſooner had deliuered the princes pleaſure, but the knight whoſe affections was ſomwhat bent to her loue, as one new riſē from a dreame,

Of all which, when he had with ſuch kinde thankes requited her, and that ſhee felt the toole had taken ſome conceit of her lyking, cunningly to ſée howe this potion would worke, ſhee ſayeth:
               
                  Siegniur Gualintie, for that I haue noted the weake conditions of men, and ſée by experience the ſmall account they haue of their words, and faithfull promiſe, I dare not ſay what I would, wherefore, I am enforced to conceale in ſecret, that which to the death conſumeth mée. And therefore withall, feigning a womaniſh kinde of heauineſſe, powring forth a fewe diſſembling teares, like the Crocadill, to effect her intended euill, ſhe ceaſeth her ſpeach. Gualintie which ſawe theſe vnexpected motions, amazed thereat, could not ſuddenly conceiue what theſe motions might intend, yet ayming at her paſſion, which he imagined was ſome diſcontent, he ſaith.
               Honoured Princeſſe, what occaſions your grace hath to carrie ſo hard opinions of mens conſtancie, it were too dé

               The Princeſſe Argentino, glad to find the Gentleman in ſo good a humor, was eaſily drawne to beléeue what he promiſed. And therefore without ſtanding on tearmes of light beléefe, ſhe ſayde. Gentle knight, whoſe worde I hold ſo firme, as the ſureſt bands, I accept your kinde proffer of courteſie, for which, by that true fayth which honour ought to maintaine, your performance ſhall bee ſo requited, as thou ſhalt euer bée honoured for the ſame, and thy poſteritie. Therefore what I intend, I will nor can no longer conceale from thée.
               Know (gentle knight) and with that a ſigh drawing teares, reſtrained her diſſembling ſpéech, ſo that ſhe could not vtter what ſhe had to ſay, yet putting off ſhe proceedes: Let it bee knowne to thée, moſt honoured knight, thoſe abuſes offered me in our owne Court, by that diſloyall and vniuſt knight of the holy Croſſe, who making ſhewes of loue vnto mee, manie times courted me with his falſe intended ſuites, as well as by his flattering teares of no other intent, as I find now by iuſt proofe, but to diſhonour me and my father: elſe after ſo manie proteſtations, vowes, and ſolemne oathes taken, his loyall affection to me was ſuch, as no torment nor ſorrow, nor no turmoyle whatſoeuer, could remoue from his falſe and diſſembling heart: he would not before my face in preſence of my gracious father, and his moſt noble Péeres, haue conioyned himſelfe in marriage with a runnagate Damſell, a begger, a common traueller, and therefore no better then a common courtezan, by his diſgrace, ſo diſgracing mee, as the remembraunce thereof can neuer be rooted from my faithfull heart, nor neuer

ſpelles hath woonne his loue from me, to her liking, which otherwiſe ſhe could neuer haue done.
               This (good knight quoth ſhe,) my long proteſtations might wearie thee: but pardon my fault, and imagine how deare I holde thée, that amongſt all the Knights of my fathers Court, haue made choyſe of you, to participate with mee of my great heauineſſe: for which, if thou canſt but ſet downe a reuenge ſufficient for them, but chiefly for that enchaunting ſorcereſſe, and execute it by thine owne hande, I promiſe my ſelfe thine euerlaſtingly, or what other reward ſo euer thou ſhalt require.

                     lintie, which felt by her ſpéeches, that gréefe ſhe endured, was onely a longing to reuenge her of her loues riuall, a torment which ſtingeth all women to the heart, hoping ſhe would proue as firme as ſhe proffered ſhe would, and that in pleaſing her fancie, and reuenging her on the Ladie, hée ſhoulde gaine her loue, for ſo much by her inſinuating ſpéech hée gathered, ſtanding on no more poynts of hauing, but effecting her worde.
               He vowed by that honour, which at her princely fathers hands he had receiued, neuer to take one quiet ſléepe, vntill hée was for her on the Ladie throughly reuenged, and that with ſuch rygour, as ſhee her ſelfe could not deuiſe ſo ill a torment. And ſo taking his leaue, humbly kiſſing her handes, he left her to her accuſtomed thoughts, ſpéeding to the Lantano of the citie, or as we ſay the Admirall, who had charge of all the kings Gallies, Foyſts, Brigandines, and Frigots, vnto whom, faigning a matter of ſeruice, hee had for the imployment of one chiefe Gallie, he compounded with him for her, and preſently had her furniſhed, with vittailes, and all other néedfull things: which done, as one carefull of what he intended, he put to the Seas, and by his owne ſkill, knowing what courſe the Ladie kept for her port of Cenito Vecha, ſhaped the like to his maiſter, rowing that night with all the force his poore ſlaues was able to make.

The Maiſter which could well demeane himſelfe, knowing the knight to be of great account, and beléeuing what he had ſayd, promiſed his beſt furtherance for the ſame. And ſhifting his courſe for their more ſpéede, well waiting howe the wind had ſcanted vpon them, halled ouer for an Iland, where commonlie all men bound that way, accuſtomed to water. In which place by chaunce vnhappily they met them. The Lady and her wom

               But the knight whoſe heart was bound to reuenge him on a guiltleſſe Ladie, no ſooner came to anchor in the road, but halling the ſhip, enquired for the Lady, who was then a ſhore, which hearing, he ſpéedeth vnto them, furniſhed with twentie of his beſt men well appoynted, which he thought to bee ſuffient to ſuppriſe ſuch naked people as hee ſuppoſed they were. No ſooner was he on land, but with hollow heart, ſaluting the Frenchemen he met, vnto whomhe was well knowne, requiring ſpéeches with the Ladie, he was by thoſe that honoured her for her fathers loue, as alſo for her noble huſband, ſimply conducted to the place, where the Frier, with all the Marchants were deuoutly on their knées at prayer, vnto whoſe Oriſons this bloodie minded knight, as bad clearke, ſaid Amen, long before it was time, without regard of honour or oath made for defence of Ladyes, ruſhing vpon them, layde violent handes vppon her, and others on the reſt of the Gentlewomen, intending to haue carried her away perforce, which the Frenchmen ſéeing, loth to looſe the Ladies good company,

               How the Knight of the holie Croſſe, after ſome ſmall ſtay in Peloponenſes, betooke him to his trauaile, with his fortunes.
               
                  
                     EDward hauing repoſed himſelfe in this Citie, thinking the time long vntil hee ſawe the ende of his deſired iourney, taking leaue of the Viceroy, betooke himſelfe to his good fortunes. Two dayes trauailed hee throughout thoſe deſarts of Greece, onely accompanied with his Page, and a Currier which was his guide. The thirde day hee had ſight of a mightie conuoy of Cammils, being at leaſt ſixe thouſand, with their Marchants, which came from India, bound into Egypt. To thoſe gouernours and Marchants he ſent, requiring them of vittailes to relieue his ſtore: his wine and oyle, by a caſuall happe being loſt, and no place of refuge néere to relicue it by a farre way: which the Marchants verie kindly graunted, furniſhing his wants of what he required, and they could ſpare. With this companie he continued thrée daies, very pleaſantly paſſing the time amongſt them, of whoſe companie they were all right glad. The third day drawing towards the euening, as they began to vnfurniſh their Cammils, and to ſet vp their Tents, determining to lodge there all night, their eſpials deſcried a companie of armed people, well mounted, which ſped them towards their companie, ſo hardly purſuing the ſcowts, that they had much a doo to eſcape. Of theſe people the Marchants had great doubt, and ſéemed to be verie much troubled in minde at theſe tidings: which the knight perceiuing, chéered them with ſuch comfortable ſpéeches, as he could h
                     •
                  ſt vtter, and they vnderſtand: arming himſelfe to withſtand their forces, and placing his companies with ſuch weapons as they had to receiue

them, which was ſcarcely finiſhed, before ſixe galland Caunleres, with their ſtaues charged come néere vnto them, and required the marchants to deliuer thoſe goods they had, for the vſes of their king.
               The Marchants, repoſing themſelues of this noble champion, were driuen to a non plus, what to aunſwer, but as men amazed, ſtoode gazing one the other in the face, whoſe timerouſneſſe the knight perceiuing, dreading no colours, mounting himſelfe with his ſtaffe charged in the reſt, ſingled himſelfe, and putting forwarde, required thoſe gallants to ſay what their buſineſſe was. The Tartares perceiuing him to bee a knight at Armes, and they ſouldiours, anſwered.
               Sir, what thou art we know not, but by thy ſeeming, if wée be not deceiued, thou art a man of Armes, whom we come not in any ſort to moleſt. But for theſe baſe fugitiues, which haue wronged our King of his cuſtomes, due to be payde of all men paſſing his Countrey, we come to be ſatiſfied, which we will haue, or leeſe our deareſt liues in gaining thereof: therefore gentle ſir, as we haue declared the truth of our comming, take no part with them, if thou loueſt thine owne welfare. The knight which heard their reaſonable anſweres, could not take any thing ſpoken in ill part, vntill he had examined the truth of the marchants, and whether there was any ſuch cuſtome due to their king as they required, which on there great oathes they denied, vowing vnto them by all ſolemne proteſtations they could vſe, that there were none belonging to the King, but outlawes, and ſuch as liued on the ſpoyles of trauailers, neither was there euer any cuſtome required of anie prince in their time, ſome of them hauing vſed that paſſage many yeares before.
               The good knight which was loath to wrong either part, could not tell what to anſwer, conſidering the guiſe of men, which is to make the beſt of their owne matters, called the chéefeſt marchants, for in them he had moſt truſt, and examining ſtrictlie each particular, of their abode, their cauſe of trauaile, and their place whither they were bounde, ſwore them to the truth of all

what they had ſpoken, which donehe returned againe vnto the armed outlawes, which attended his anſwer, ſaying.
               Falſe villaines, and deceitfull wretches, how dare you, being robbers and diſturbers of peaceable trauailers, ſo much to abuſe the reuerent name of your king, who is altogither vnacquainted with your trecheries, as to make his authoritie a ſhelter for your bloodie mindes, and ſpoyling the goodes of honeſt men, that you haue abuſed both him and vs, you ſhall all well know. Therefore if your buſineſſe be no other then I haue notize it is, depart, or you ſhall know, to your great ſorrow, and hearts griefe, that you haue met with him which will not bee dared with your high lookes.
               The Tartares hearing him ſpeake ſo like himſelfe, and with ſuch reſolution, could well haue forborne to deale with him, or his companie, yet ſetting their reſt vpon the courage of their companie, which were all well appoynted, and better mounted, defied the knight, who taking all aduantages, ſeeing their reſolution ſuch, encouraging the Marchants, who were all fearefull of looſing what they had, began moſt honourably to aſſaile them whoſe power was as brauely reſiſted a long time: in this conflict was moſt honourable deedes of Armes by the noble knight done, who euer cheared his companies, which were all likely to runne away. So hote and fiercely continued this good knight this aſſault, that encountering hand to hand the principall leaders, he gaue them ſuch payment, as they could not with all their ſkill finde fault with their paymaiſter: ſuch order hée tooke with them, dealing dole to all their coſts, that manie of them for feare fled the fielde, betaking them to places where they might beholde the woonderfull déeds of honour done by this moſt renowmed knight, which on all ſides they ſo aſſayled, as he had no way to get out, but ſuch paſſage as he made with his well tempered Curtelar, of whoſe mettall he made at that inſtant ſufficient proofe, which thoſe outlawes well felt. And p

                  yuing their power too weake, to conquer where ſuch a guider was, reſolued no longer to abide in hope, but euerie one to make ſuch meanes

as he beſt could for his owne ſafetie, which the noble knight perceyuing, ſo hotlye purſued, that many Tartares ſoules hee ſent to death: Others without armes, legges, and other limmes, lay weltering in theyr owne bloud, that it was lamentable to ſée, ſuch a Maſſacre amongeſt men, if they had beene ſuch, as in men liuing in Princes obedience they ſhould bée.
               Theſe Peſſants thus flying, and the noble Edwarde wearied with purſute of them, night béeing at hande, ſo as it was not to bee diſcerned a friend from a foe, returning againe vnto his companyes Tentes, in a Valley diſtaunt from them a good Myle, hée was there at vnawares ſet vppon by one of their leaders, which had eſcaped him in the battaile, who gathering together an hundreth of his ſtraggling Conſorts, knowing him to bée gone that way, encountered him, who béeing wearie of the toyle taking ſo lately, had like to haue put him to the foyle, béeing ſo at the aduauntage aſſayled. Yet hee whoſe heart neuer was ſéene to faynt, arming himſelfe to defende, caſting his Shéelde on his arme, putting himſelfe amongeſt the rowte of them, ſtill crying Lancaſter, God and Saint George for Englande, laying ſo about him, that ſome heades, ſome handes, and others in moſt pitifull wiſe crying out, hee made way thorowe the thickeſt, ſo behauing himſelfe, that euerie one that coulde make ſhift for one, was willing to giue him rowme, and to bée gone. Of whome béeing cleared, breathing himſelfe, and receyuing ſome ayre, hee might eſpie before him running vp the Hill, a Gallant mounted on a Milke white Courſer, which the knight imagined ſhoulde bee the commaunder of thoſe companies which laſt aſſayled him, with whom deſirous to acquaint himſelfe: hee gaue ſpnrres to his horſe, and ſo earneſtly followed this Companion, who little thought of his comming, that ouer-taking him before hee was looked for, hee areſted him ſo ſoundlie with his blade of authoritie, as he made him forſake his Horſe, to taſte the ſwéeteneſſe of the

earth, which done he diſmounted himſelfe, ſaying: Abide you gallant, and accept a ſtraungers courteſie. I promiſe thée falſe fellon as thou art thou diſhonoureſt thy Maiſter, which made thée a receiuer of cuſtome, to run away when payment is tendered: wherefore ſéeing there is no more truſt in thée, héere in your kings name, I diſcharge thée of this office. And ſo at one blow taking his head with his Curtelax from his bodie, left his ſoule to him that had moſt right.
               This latter taſke accompliſhed, breathing himſelfe a while, hee mounted his Horſe, and pacing eaſily towardes the Tents, which by the fires light hée had ſight of, hée was mette with diuerſe of his companie of the Marchants, who béeing men of more valewe then manie of the reſt, had put themſelues in ſearch of this woorthie Knight, paſſing all the way, thorowe ſo manie heapes of deade men, and grieuous wounded bodyes, that they admired his worthineſſe, aplawding his valour, and ſtill prayſing him, giuing him the honour, aboue all men at Armes, whatſoeuer they had either heard of or ſéene.
               Thus paſſing on in ſearch of their honourable friend, whoſe companie they were not willing to forgo, ſometimes carefull of his welfare, otherwhile commending his hawtie déeds of chiualrie, they eſpied paſſing downe the hill, a man armed, which they coulde not perfectly diſcerne, and therefore made a ſtande, intending to ſée if there came any more, before they put themſelues into daunger. But beeing perceyed of the Knight, who ſtoode ſtill on his guarde, doubtfull of anie more ſuch vnexpected cuſtomers, making readie for the fight. And giuing his Horſe ſuch way, as in his ſwifteſt galloppe hee accuſtomed to make, he cried fiercelie out ſaint George. At which words the Marchants hauing knowledge of him, diſmounted themſelues, and kiſſing his handes, his knées and feet, honored him for more then a mortall man, which kindneſſe, aſbeit he expected no ſuch reuerent honour, hee tooke thankefully, requiting them with all courteſie, for the care they had of his well doing, ſo with pleaſant diſcourſes

they paſſe the way vntill they came to thrée tents, where they alighting, tooke him carefully from his horſe, and bringing him with all dutie to his lodging puruaide for him, they vnarmed him, waſhing his bruſed body, and ſuch ſmall ſcarres as hée reſerued in fight, with moſt precious Balmes, which done, making him all the frolike cheare and honour they could, they commend him for that night to his reſt, cauſing a ſure guard, and héedfull watch to attend him in his tent, and placing faithfull ſentinels, dreading the enemies, they tooke themſelues to their quiet repoſe.

               Howe the Knight of the Croſſe, taking leaue of the Marchants and their companie, left them to their iourney.
               
                  THe day ne ſooner gaue light, but the Negroes and ſlaues prouided to load their Camels, which done, the Tents taken downe, and all things ordered to depart, the way lying now for the knight to leaue their companie, when they had well broken theyr faſt, and carowſed to their welfare, prouiding of al ſuch prouiſion as they had, they preſented him with a moſt curious caſket of the rareſt Iewels that euer his eyes beheld, beſéeching him to accept them at their hands, as intereſt of their loues, vowing themſelues euer his in all humble ſeruices. The Knight which was as courteous as valiant, ſéeing their thankfulneſſe ſuch, making choyſe of ſome ſpeciall Iewels, required them to value thoſe which hée did fancie, for without paying their prize, hée would accept none. The Marchants which had receiued the benefit of his valour, and fréed from thòſe men of miſchiefe which had deſpoyled them of all if hee had béene abſent, generally beſought him to take in worth thoſe they had preſented, for that not onely theyr goods but their liues was his, alleadging

that by him they enioyed what they had, and therefore would not be intreated to receiue any of them againe, but beſought him with all humbleneſſe, if hee would not receiue them, to beſtow them on whom he would.
               The knight when he ſaw their importunate ſute, commended their thankfulneſſe, willing them to attribute that good hée had done for thē to God, by whoſe ſufferance he had wrought their ſafetie, and in all places to ſpeake of Englands honour, and their knight aduenturers: which done, taking thoſe Iewels of moſt eſtéeme with him, hee commended them to theyr iourney, who with many loath depart, bade him often times farewell with heauie hearts. This adue taken, we leaue the knight to his aduentures, the Marchants to finiſh their iourney, vntill fit time ſerue to recount ſuch other aduentures as hée enterpriſed, to ſhew you further of the Lady Valia, Alynde and their honeſt company, left in the vnfrequented Iſle.
            
            
               CHAP. V.
               Of the great diſcomfort of the Lady Vallia, who of a conceited feare, fell ſicke of a greeuous malladie.
               
                  YOu haue heard gentils, how the Ladie Vallia with thoſe Merchants, was in the vnfrequent Iland, left without any manner of ſuſtenaunce or reléefe, other then ſuch wilde rootes, hearbes, and fruites, as naturally had their beeing in that barraine ſoyle, through which vnuſuall diet, and a conceited feare of more inſuing daungers, the Lady fell ſicke of an extreame malladie, for whoſe recouerie no helpe could auaile: yet did thoſe religious Hermits and Fryers the beſt they could. The Marchants and others of the companie, to amende theyr diet, employed theyr labours to fiſh, and to making of ginnes, to take foule and ſuch beaſts as was there to be had, onely

for her content, but in vaine do they ſéeke to mittigate her ſorrowes, or recouer her health, ſuch was her gréefe for her Lords abſence, and feare of more harſh purſuit of the enemies.
               In this perplexed eſtate continued this good Lady, paſt all hope of recouerie, giuen quite ouer to death by all the companie, who ceaſed not their prayers for her good health. But as in all extremes the fauour of our God is moſt ſhewne, ſo beholde in this, Vallia lying on her hard cabine, ſlumbring as in a dreame, there appeared vnto her thoughts a beautifull Perſonage, ſo glorious in his attyre, as ſhe beholding thereof ſéemed to lacke her ſenſes. This Angell as ſhée ſuppoſing, after ſome pauſe and ſtanding to behold her, thus ſaid.
               
                  VAllia, ſurſeace thy further dread: thy Lord eioyeth his life, whom once againe thou ſhalt meete, but haue no knowledge of him for a time: thine neareſt allied death hath taken: yet diſmay not, for in the ſeede of thy wombe ſhalt thou be made glorious. My meſſage is done: thine interceſſions are hard, and thy deliuery from this place asit hand.
               
               This ſaid, clapping his wings, as to her ſéemed, hée left the caue, and departed, wherewith Vallia, as one awaked from a trance, ſéeming as one of her wits to be bereft, cried mainely out for helpe, whoſe ſodaine motions cauſed them all to feare her death was at hand: yet comforted they her all they might with ſuch ſpéech & words of heauēly pleaſures as in ſuch times is conuenient to be vſed, ſo long continuing their talke, that in the end graſping her hād about the neck of her truſty Alinda: ſhe raiſed her ſelfe in her bed, and fetching a déep ſigh, ſaid. Reuerent father Hermit, you patron of learning, and others my good friendes, this night haue I ſéene my ſauiour face to face, who by his diuine prouidence hath vouchſafed to ſhew him, ſelfe vnto me his ſinfull handmaide, by whom I am aſſured of my Lords proſperitie, and all our fréedomes from this place.
               The Hermit and the reſt hearing theſe ſpéeches proceed from

her imagined the lightneſſe of her head had moued theſe fancies, and had the more doubt of her good health, and ſtanding as men amazed, gazing one the other in the face, were as men ſenſeleſſe, whoſe hard beléefe of her words vttered, cauſed her thus replie. Fathers and my good friends, let it not ſéeme incredulous what I haue ſayde, but attend the euent, which enſuing to our comforts as we expect, giue the honour to him, by whoſe prouidence we are comforted. This ſaid, bidding them good night, ſhée fell into a moſt ſwéete ſléepe, in which ſhe continued till the morning was farre ſpent. Before which time the company which vſually went about their vndertaken labours for getting their victuals, from the tops of the mountaines deſcried a ſmall ſayle at ſea, which they viewed, earneſtly waiting by a compaſſe they had, which way ſhée bare: but ſo long gazed they, that the gale blowing hie, and fitting their cauſe, which were bounde thither for water, hauing ſpent their ſtore at ſea, through ſuch continuall foule wether which they indured, in ſuch manner, that they durſt ceaſe no land for feare of daunger. They deſcried their hull, which ſéene, well was hée that might make moſt haſte with the firſt tydings, thinking the time long vntill they came to the caue, where béeing néere ſpéechleſſe with the haſt they made, a ſodaine feare poſſeſſed all the companie, ſpecially Alinda, whoſe heart was at her héele vntill ſhee heard them deliuer the cauſe of their ſpéedie comming, which knowne, God was glorified in generall. And Villia as one ouer ioyed at this ſodaine newes, might not by any intreatie be held longer in her bed, but calling for her apparrell, attired her ſelfe with ſuch courage, as if ſhée had felt no gréefe, which done, reſting her weake body on the arme of her Alinda, ſhee left the deſolate caue, to take the comfort of the ſwéete ayre abroade, and to ſée the euent of thoſe bleſſed tydidgs ſhe hoped of.
               By this time was the ſhip ancored, and the Marriners making haſte for water, whereof they had great neede, hoyſed their boate, and with their veſſels came a ſhore, where they were heartily welcommed of thoſe poore diſtreſſed people,

who enquired diligently from whence they were, and what occaſion droue them to that coaſt. Syr quoth the boatſwaine, being a man of ſome good demeanour, we are of Sicilia, an Iland belonging to the Spaniſh king, bound by our charty partie, for the coaſt of Egypt, and méeting as poore ſea men oft doo, with foule weather, the winds raiging in ſuch maner, our ſtore of wine being ſpent, & water ſcarce, our cōming is hither for that reléefe. Thus ſir, quoth he, as I haue acquainted you with our fortunes, refuſe not to let vs knowe what you are, which haue your abode in a place ſo vnfrequēted as this, where I haue before this time bin oftē, but neuer ſaw or heard any yt liued here.
               Friend quoth the Marchant, wee are here a great many poore diſtreſſed ſoules, which by violence of an enemie that vnawares aſſailed vs on the ſhore, were driuen for ſafegard of this Lady to ſtand on our defence, where by fortune and the aſſiſtance of God, we vanquiſhed the proude daring enemies, which were on land with vs: which when his companions perceiued that kept aboord his gally, they firſt rifling our ſhip, taking what they beſt liked, and afterwards leauing vs without any reléefe, ſauing that apparrell on our backes, ſunke our ſhip, and left vs to our fortunes, ſince which time we neuer had ſight of any man or ſhippe, whereof we had any hope of comfort, before this time. Therefore if God haue ordained you for our good, and that as Chriſtians you pittie our diſtreſſes, helpe this Lady with vs her friendes, to any place inhabited by Chriſtians, your payment ſhall be large, and your charitable déede rewarded both of God and men.
               The Boatſwayne being a man as full of pitte as courage, hearing this lamentable diſcourſe, and ſéeing the weake eſtate of the Lady, was moued with remorſe of their good, promiſing his beſt furtherance for their comforts: ſo ſhipping one hogſhead of water for the companie, haſtneth aboord, taking with him the Fryer and two Marchants, whoſe words wrought ſuch effect with the maſter and the reſt, that a concluſion was paſte for their paſſage, and the maſter comming a ſhoare, brought with him for the Ladies releefe, ſuch

bread, ſuccor, and other prouiſion as he had, which came in good time, and not before it was long looked for, which was as thankfully receiued. The maſter and his company hauing a care to bee at ſea, applyed all their people to labour, ſo that within two dayes they were well prouided with water, ready to ſet ſayle.
            
            
               CHAP. VI.
               How Vallia and the reſt taking leaue of their good hoſt the Hermit, was ſhipped from thence, with their fortunes.
               
                  SVch was the induſtrie of the Maſter, that long time was not ſpent before all néedful things were prouided, when hauing a pleeſing gale for their courſe, warning was giuen to the paſſengers to be readie, for whom they made no long ſtay, but their leaue taken of the old Hermit, they commend him in their prayers to God, and themſelues to ſuch ſucceſſe as they expected.
               Al things fitted and the paſſengers aboord, the ancors weyed, an nimble boy yare with his knife, gaue way to the ſayles, which tryned to good paſſe, a maine they cutte the waues, and ioyful of this happines, as to be endowed with great treaſure, two daies & more they enioyed of quiet and calm content, without any annoyance either of wether or enemies: the third morning beeing ouercaſt and gloomie, a Boy looking out for daungers, eſpied vnder the edge of an Iland, two ſtout Gallies, who hauing ſight of the Shippe, made towardes them with all ſpéede they could, of which béeing aduertiſed, a generall feare poſſeſſed all their hearts, eſpecially the Ladie, who hauing ſo lately felt the force and extremitie of the mercileſſe foe, was doubtfull of the like. But how timerous ſoeuer women in their kinde be, it reſteth for men in extremities to ſhew themſelues. The maſter being a man of courage, called

all the companie, as well ſtrangers as others, and vnto them hée ſayth. Friendes all and companions, wee haue nowe ſmall time to ſtande on diſcourſes, ſéeing our enemies are at hand: if enemies they bée, as it is moſt likely, howif they getts the beſt, and wée by our cowardize ſubiect our ſelues vnto them, I doubt not but you all haue heard what miſ
                     •
                  rie wée ſhall endure, for Turkes they are, that is without all doubt: therefore like men ſhewe your ſelues and arme you with courage and hope of victorie, for howſoeuer death cannot bee ſo bitter as the torments they will inflict on you, if they preuaile. Therefore as many as will take parte with mée, holde vp your heades, and prouide for your ſafetie.
               Theſe wordes were no ſooner deliuered from the Maiſter, but you might ſée with what vnited hearts euerie man gaue his conſent to fight it out, and ſtanding on no tearmes, euery man prouided him ſuch weapons as hee coulde beſt vſe, lacing cloſe theyr mettinges, and making ready theyr fire workes to annoy them: whilſt euerie man was thus buſied, Vallia whome feare hadde neare ouerwhelmed, was comforted by her friendly truſt Alinda, who chearing her weake ſpirits, ſaid. Auant your feare Madam, caſt heauineſſe aſide, and let not theſe ſullen thoughts cumber you, wée know the worſt, death is to bée preferred before a miſerable life. Therefore take courage, ſh
                     •
                  we your ſelfe to bée your ſelfe, and remember your noble Lorde, who were hée preſent, would dare all thoſe curs to behold his face. Though we be women lets do our beſt, or at leaſt, if your heart quaile, giue me leaue, for before you die ſome of them ſhall abie your life, or both my heart, power, and weapon ſhall faile me.
               
                  Vallia, which ſawe her woman in this humour, could not forbeare to ſmile, howe heauie ſoeuer her heart was, yet ſetting a good face on the matter, ſayde, well Alinda well, your great ſhewes will proue I feare but a bolde cowards bragge, as much may they do that ſay little, as they that fill the ayre with threatning clamours, whatſoeuer thy thoughts are of my

feare, if my helpe néede, whereunto I truſt it will neuer come, Alinda ſhall ſée Vallia hath Raynolds heart, though not his apparrell.
               Whilſt they were thus pleaſantly ieſting, to the good encouraging of all the companie, whoſe care was moſt for them, the Gallies comming vp, hailed them, commanding them to ſtrike, and the maiſter with the Marchants to come aboord, or without reſiſtance to ſuffer them enter. The Marchants of France, paſſengers hearing theyr peremtory ſpéeches, anſwered. Proude and vnhallowed curs, what think ye of vs, to bée men or babes, that you dare vs ſo with theſe ſpéeches, knowe that before thou haue in poſſeſſion the leaſt haire of any of our heades, thou ſhalt déerely abye them, therefore amaine, amaine, and therewith all hauing his péece reade, fired the ſame, aiming at the poope, wherewith ſhooting at randen, by great fortune killed the Admirall of the Gallies, w
                     •

                  w their ſlaues and companies like Bées: which diſaduantage the Turks ſéeing and féeling, fighting ſo farre off, borded them one on the one ſide, the other on the other: at this onſet beganne the Spaniards to quaile, which were chéered to the fight by their paſſengers, who ſéeing theyr valour, was incouraged to ſticke to that which elſe they had giuen ouer, eſpecially ſéeing and noting how manly and without feare, the Lady Vallia and her Alinda deuoired themſelues, who ſpying their times to worke on the aduantage, ſéeing their chaines full with Turks, ready to enter theyr ſhip, from a port with their ſhorte pikes, ſpoyled many, thruſting them ouer boord, and killing diuers, and ſpéeding them from that labour, two naked Turkes hauing faſtned an anchor at their Shippes rother, thinking to enter in theyr ſtearne partes, by Vallia and Alinda were ſo plyed with Pottes of Powder fired, Pikes of wilde fire, and ſuch other, as theyr whole companie giuing ouer the fight, there was very fewe or none, eyther Turkes or Chriſtian ſlaues

which could ſtand ſo pitifully were they ſpoyled, burned, and maſſacred, whereby they enforced them to yéeld themſelues vnto the Chriſtians mercies, of whom they tooks ſmall pitie: but drenching them all in the ſea they founde aliue, ſunke one of the Gallyes, and taking all the Chriſtians into the other that were able to ſerue, fréed them from their chaines, and cauſed the wounded to be dreſt, left the Gally in poſſeſſion that night of a Marchant of Marceelas: which done, and all things quietly ended, the Frier which ſawe how valiantly the Ladie and Alinda employed their forces, highly commended them for their forwardneſſe in this action, which made Alinda in ieaſting maner thus to ſay. That your Ladiſhip is become ſo valiant on the ſudden, I do not greatly maruell, conſidering the fellowſhip you haue ſo lately with ſo honourable a knight, whoſe courage hath animated you to this hardineſſe: if the huſband bee famous for his woorth and honour gained in all places, no doubt but France and Spaine, and Italie, ſhall ſound the Ladie Vallia her high deſerued commendations, whom, if God bleſſe with increaſe of children, are likelie to proue men of high account in the worlde, if they haue the fathers courages, or the mothers ſtomacke which is paſſed by with an Engliſh heart. Vallia hearing her Maiden to ieaſt thus broad, cut off her ſpeach thus.
               
                  Alinda, what motions are theſe, that on ſuch ſudden cauſeth your ſtrings to iarre ſo farre beyond your cuſtome, ſuch maner of ieaſts I brooke not, though louing thée, I ſtraine my ſelfe at this time to digeſt them. In deliuering of which ſpéech, Alinda perceiuing by her vnwonted ſcowling of her browes, that ſhée was ſomewhat diſcontent at her ſpéech, forbare her further anſweres for that time. To put her from her melancholie, the maſter of the ſhip, told her ſuch viands as they had was readie, if ſhée pleaſes to ſup: whereunto ſhe was eaſily entreated, hauing gotten her a ſtomacke with her long faſting, and hard toyle in the fight Their diſcourſes at table of each ſeuerall accident happening, I omit, to let you knowe their enſuing actions with their ſucceſſe.
            
            
               
               CHAP. VII.
               How the Spaniards deliuered the Gally vnto the French Marchants, and Mariners, with ſuch vittailes as they needed, who taking with them the Lady Vallia, left them.
               
                  THe Lady with her friends diſcourſt at ſupper of the dangers paſt, leauing nothing of worth by any one particular vnremembred, done in that action, a motion was made, that the Gally with the flaues able to labor, and vittails neceſſary ſhould be giuen vnto her to bring her to her deſired port, vnto which the Spaniards to requite the good done them by her whole companie, granted very willingly, for performance of which, order was preſently takē, and each thing néedfully puruaide to the ladies good content. In the morning early by break of the day, the maſter hauing the wind faire, was loath to make longer ſtay then néed, haled the gally, willing them to com néere the ſhip, and vnto the marchant reuealed their intent, and what the whole companie had agréed vpon, which was verie well accepted of the French men, who rendred him many thanks for his fauour, for diſpatch of them both: ſuch haſt was made as poſſible they might, which was ſodenly done to the general, reioicing of theſe poore captiues who by this ouerthrow of the Turks, were made frée. The ladie aboord, taking their ſolemne farewell each of other, they ſhaped each one there ſeueral courſe beſt fitting their turne. Vallia frolike with her companie, & holy father, vnto whom with a verie thankfull mind vnto her maker for all the ſucceſſe ſhe had receiued from him, and accompliſhing her hearts deſire, omitted nothing worthy the recounting, to the great admiration of all the hearers, eſpecially the Frier, whoſe charge ſhe was, who calling to mind the fauor of God, in reuealing to her by viſion their time of ſudden departure, thought her ſome holy & choſen woman, & euer after in all his Maſſes & other ceremoniall rites

according to the order of their church and blind deuotion, extolled the ladie farre beyond her expectation. Thus falling frō one diſcourſe to another, to driue the time away: after they had ſpēt one whole wéeke at ſea, they might diſcouer ye mountains néer the old city Ceueta vecha, or old Rome, ſo called, & had al things ſo fauourable to their deſire, that long before night they recouered the road, where comming to anker, was preſently boorded by the officers of the citie, who had great feare they had bin Turks at their firſt comming in: but hauing ſome conference with the Frier, was certified of all their procéedings, leauing nothing vnſpoken which might gaine them fame, and the ladie honour, wherfore the officers hauing knowledge, holding that truth which the frier had ſpoken, whileſt they frolicke with the ladie, & her company, ſent his guidelow a ſhore with one of his confederates, charging him to deliuer to the abbot & his friers what he heard, taking like order for puruaying her of lodging in the old palace of the Emperour, which he cauſed to be furniſhed with all néedfull furniture, as the ſhortneſſe of time would permit them, with all prouiſion that was there to be had.
               The officer who was a ioyfull man of theſe tidings to be the meſſenger, haſteneth all he might, being with child with thoſe newes, & longing to be deliuered, wherfore as ſoone as he recouered the ſhore, ſtaieth not vntill he came vnto the lord abbot, vnto whom he forgat nothing of his charge, which the old man hearing, bleſſing & croſſing himſelf, wōderouſly perplexed with the ſtrangenes of ye tale deliuered, he firſt called his couent togither in their church, wher they praiſed God for them, and their ſafetie, and ſo putting on all their beſt maſking attire, went in proceſſion to the ſea ſide, to receiue her a ſhore, where they carried with them the ſpecialleſt relicks they had.
               The captaine of the towne with his band, in ſolemne order marching in like maner, and all the bels ringing for ioy, to welcome the holy Ladie. After all theſe the gouernors and councell of the towne in their order, making ſuch a beautifull ſhewe as had not béene on ſuch a ſudden euer ſéene before.
               All things ordred at point deuice, boats were ſent out ſo richly

furniſhed with Tapiſtrie, Carpets, and curious Cuſhions, as was a wonder to ſee, the ſhore ſtanding full with all the people in the Towne.
               The men appoynted to bring her a ſhore, being noble men, the one a gouernour in the towne, the other a Cardinall, who boording the Gally, on their knées ſolemnly kiſſed her handes and féet, doing her as much honour as if our Ladie had bin preſent, which ſhe tooke ſmall pleaſure to haue, which done, and a generall welcome to the whole companie, the gouernour entreated her to take the comfort of the ſhore, to which ſmall perſwaſions ſerued, at her going to the boat, well was hee that might ſet hand to helpe, & he thought himſelfe moſt happieſt, yt could come neareſt her, ſuch fopperie wos not vſed aboord, but much more on the ſhore, where was ducking on all ſides, crouching and kneeling, with ſuch ſinging, drumming & gunning, that ye Eccho thereof was enough to make a man ſicke. The welcome giuen, this noble Ladie might not be ſuffered to touch the earth with her féete. But at her landing place, was ſpred a moſt ſumptuous cloath of eſtate, and a Chaire thereon to reſt her, where when ſhe had a while repoſed her ſelfe, and euery one of account kiſſed her féete and hands, foure commanders, two Prieſts, and two Captains, carried her in the chaire, ouer whom was borne by the Abbot, the Cardinall, and two noble men, amoſt rich Canapie. So marched ſhée vntill they came vnto the Abbey, where preparation was made for her lodging, where the Proceſſion ending, the Cardinall and Abbot tooke leaue of the gouernours of the towne, bidding them good night.
               But they which had prouided the Emperours pallace, and béene at great charge for her viands, tooke in ill part, that anie ſuch vnkindneſſe ſhould be offered them, and in quiet maner beſought them to grant them leaue to haue the guard of her, which they ſo ſcornefully anſwered, that the Cardinall in ſpeaking as his cholericke nature accuſtomed, with his hande had like to haue giuen the Gouernour a blowe on the face, which vnkindneſſe the ſouldiours diſdaining, by violence ſought to

carrie the Ladie, in ſuch maner, and with ſuch harſh behauiour on both ſides, that the Cardinall, Abbot, the Croſſe, Banners, and all were layd lowe on the earth, and ſuch a hurley burley begunne, as was neuer ſéene the like, ſtriuing for the Ladies entertainment, which gréeued the good Ladie, which was then to be ruled by thoſe of greateſt power, the ſouldiers and commaunders of the Towne, with whom ſhe was beſt pleaſed, for that her loue and honourable Lord, was a man of Armes and honour.
               This diſcurteſie the Cardinall and his company tooke in ſuch ill part, that they curſed all the Towne, and Towne inhabiters, ſuſpending them from the holy Church for euer. But they whoſe care was ſmall at that time, for any their doings cared but litle. The Lady they cheared, who wanted nothing that was fit for her honour and welfare, where let her repoſe her ſelfe a time with iollitie, the Fryers ſweating in their own greaſe, and the Cardinall and Abbot chafing like men frantike, to ſhewe you what after happened.

               How the Gouernour aduertiſed the Emperour, of the arriuall of the Ladie Vallia, and what after chaunced her.
               
                  THe broyle ended, a great ſturre was in all the Religious houſes, amongſt themſelues, debating of the wrong offered by the people of the Towne, the Church doores were all ſealed vp, and no man vpon paine of their curſe to enter them.
               This was conſidered of the Gouernours, who tooke aduiſe in the matter, knowing the authoritie they haue in all places where their religion taketh place. Beſought the Ladie for her Letters of fauour to the Emperour, to the end this begun enmitie, might be app

The Ladies Letters ſigned, which imported her meſſage from the Knight of the holy Croſſe, and the meſſenger appointed, there was no detracting of time, but with all ſpéed that Horſe could make, he applied his buſineſſe, vntil he came vnto Rome, where comming before the Emperour, he deliuered his Letters, which were very welcome, taking great pleaſure in the comming of the Lady into thoſe confines, being Lady and wife vnto the Knight which of all men liuing he holde in moſt regard.
               Whileſt the Emperour was diſcourſing with the Meſſenger, a Cardinall came to ſummon him before the prefence of the Pope, preſently to appeare, to anſwere thoſe wronges done by his Gouernours to the Church and Patrons thereof, of all which, the Cardinall had ſignified his holineſſe, which was held a matter moſt hainous.
               The Cardinall gone, the Emperour called againe for the Meſſenger, and with him queſtioned of all thoſe troubles begunne, whereof he did aduertiſe him in each particular, and withall, deliuered the Gouernours Letters, which he had written to that ende, doubting ſuch a chaunce would happen, and that the Cardinall would ſéeke reuenge, with all extremitie he could. When the Emperour was aduertiſed hereof, making no ſtay, he came before the Pope, vnto whom as the maner was, doing reuerence, he requireth the cauſe of his ſpéedie ſending for him.
               The Pope whoſe fury was not yet ouerpaſt, incenſed to more choler by perſwaſions of the reſt, who hung al in a ſtring, doubting leaſt giuing héed to theſe, it might incurre a farther damage vnto them all, in their ſeuerall gouernment, began in loude and moſt harſh termes to reuile the Emperour, calling him hereticke, and ſubborner of heretickes, vttering againſt him ſpéech of moſt diſhonour and diſgrace. All which the Emperour like himſelfe, as he was a moſt graue and well gouerned Magiſtrate, knowing by his owne perfections, other mens humors, forbare to anſwere what he in choller offered, but mildly leauing his preſence returned to his Pallace, very highly

diſcontent, yet gouerning his paſſions, betaking himſelfe to his ſtudie, he gan with great wiſedome to conſider of each accident, and finding his Gouernours offence to touch his reputation, albeit he had done all for his honour and credit, yet the Church carrying a hand ouer all of what eſtate ſo euer, knowing by experience their inſolencie, thought it beſt to reconcile himſelfe without farther mouing of trouble, and thereon reſoluing ſent preſently for the Cardinall his Confeſſor, vnto whom he faineth, what heauineſſe and griefe he conceiueth at thoſe vnkinde dealings of his Gouernours againſt his holineſſe, the Church, and ſtate thereof, beſéeching him, of thoſe loues he alwayes proffered vnto him, to finde ſome meane to accord his holineſſe and him, ſo that a league and peace being obtained, all wrongs might be forgotten, and his Townes men reſtored to the Church againe. All which his Confeſſour promiſed moſt faithfully to follow. And ſo taking leaue of the Emperour, ſpéedeth him to his holineſſe Preſence, where forgetting nothing that he had promiſed, omitting nothing for his better ſucceſſe, declareth at large the heauineſſe of the Emperour, for his abuſe offered againſt his will and knowledge, ſo earneſtly applyeth his ſute vnto the Pope and his honorable friends, that though with much adoo, yet at laſt an attonement was graunted, but the Emperour and the Towne fined at ten thouſand Florence for the offence: wheron concluded, a peace was made, and vnitie betwéene them, and they all reſtored to the Church.
               This brawle ended, the Emperour not forgetting his friends Lady, bent his ſtudies for her royall entertainment, for which taking order with all his Officers, he appointed a day to ſet forward to her place of abode. Till which time, we leaue them to recount vnto you the Knightes troubles, and what chaunceth him in his trauailes.

               How the Knight of the holy Croſſe, by the trechery of his guide, was robbed of his Horſe and Armour, and what happened.
               
                  AFter the departure of the Knight with ſhe Marchants, on the Mountaines of ye Tartars, comming to a place called Sylo, where he was to imbarque himſelfe, he diſcharged his guide, and ſayled with other company to Miſath, where being landed, preſented himſelfe with the reſt of the paſſengers to the Baſhaw, who came in perſon to ſée the paſſengers bounde for Ieruſalem. This Baſhaw being of a proud and inſolent cōdition, expected great reuerence, which of the common company was giuen him. But our Cauylier ſcorning ſuch baſe faſhions, could not ſtoupe in ſuch maner, wherefore the Baſhawe began in vile ſpéech to taunt him, which he better vnderſtanding then the reſt, though he had not his language ſo perfit, in Italian anſwered his ſpéeches, whereat great excepttions were taken, yet by reaſon of his ſafeconduit, he durſt no quarrell or make ſtay of him, but amongſt the reſt, without fauour, had vittailes and a guide: and ſo mounting his horſe departed, leauing the company to the common guard of the ſouldiers, as is the cuſtome.
               The Baſhawe whom ſpite had moued to choller againſt the Knight, vnderſtanding he left the ordinary paſſage, entended to cry quittance with him, by trechery, or as he beſt might, to fulfill his diuelliſh minde: And that night armed a hundreth of his beſt Ianniſaries, whom he hyred to ſlay him, appoynting them the way to follow the Knight, whom they very hardly purſued, in ſuch maner haſ
                     •
                  ning, that they had ſight of him, following by eaſie pace a long time, till night growing vppon them, they cauſed a naked Moore to ouertake him, and to keepe him company, appoynting him to take ſuch order with his

guide, that where he ſhould reſt, to robbe him both of horſe and armour: And that done, to giue them notiſe, whome he ſhould be ſure to finde by their ſeuerall Fyers, which they would of purpoſe make. With this leſſon the naked rogue left them. And ouertaking the Knight, fell in ieſting with his guide, with whom he vſed ſuch pleaſaunt behauiour, that it greatly delighted the Knight, who made much of him, and willed him to ſtay by the Fountaine where he pitched his Tent, imparting with him ſuch vittailes as he had: when the Knight had well refreſhed himſelfe, and had ſéene his Horſe well meated with barley which he brought for him, giuing ſtraight charge to the Moore his guide, to maintaine the Fyer which vſually they kept, for defence of the Lyons and wilde beaſts kéeping the deſarts, he tooke him to reſt.
               The Moore hauing now opportunitie to worke his companion, taking him from the Tent, beganne ſo to worke with him, that with ſhowes of kindneſſe being his countrey-man, loue of the ſouldiers where he liued, and hope of great reward, he wonne him to effect whatſoeuer he deſired: which done, taking the opportunitie offered, he aduentured firſt to enter the Tent, and by ſeuerall péeces tooke the Armour, his ſhield being vnder his head he durſt not touch, and his ſword with an arming lace faſtened to his arme, being well as he thought with this, they tooke each of them a Horſe, and leauing both ye knight and his Page to walke on foote, left them thus in their ſounde ſléepe.
               The trayterous villaines hauing ſped of their buſineſſe, ceaſeth not poaſting from Fyer to Fyer, vntil they had giuen notiſe to all the ſouldiers what they had done, who gathering themſelues togither, ſet on to find the Tent whither they were conducted by the guide and the other ſlaue, his companion in this practiſe. But he that in many perilles had deliuered our braue and endaunted Knight, preſerueth him ſtill for his Countries honour, as you ſhall note.
               For the villaines gone, and heauy ſlumber oppreſſing him, he fell into a ſound fléep, in which he dreamed, and in his dream

ſéemed perfitly to ſée an hoaſt of men, enuiron a fewe peaceable trauailers, which he of mere deuotion ſought to reſcue: in whih dreame awaking, and buſtling himſelfe, as to helpe thoſe diſtreſſed, ſought for his armour, being neither faſt a ſléepe nor throughly awaked: which enſuing, he calleth his Page, and both went to ſéeke their horſes which were likewiſe gone, leauing them none but the Aſſe and Mule which carrieth theyr vittailes.
               This chaunce happening, he could not imagine what to do, nor where to ſéeke thoſe miſcreants which ſo had robbed him, ye
                     •
                   ſearcheth he here and there, crying and calling for them, which were too farre off to heare him: So long they followed ſéeking thoſe villaines, that they might hear the noyſe of many horſes, which trouping made great ſpéede towards the place where they kept.
               Attentiuely liſtned the Knight, to note if he could here any voyce, and bnſily bethought him what was beſt to doo in this extreme, beléeuing verily that he was betrayed yet making no ſemblant thereof, cauſed the Page to bring from out his tent a caſe of Piſtolles with his powder and ſhotte, which commonly the Page carryed, with thoſe he charged the boye, if occaſion ſerued, to doo his beſt ſeruice, and to giue him that helpe he could, which faithfully he promiſed to accompliſh.
               Scarſly had they determined what to doo, but they might diſcry the two Moores gallopping on their horſes, which by their white Algoſines they perfitly did knowe, leading the others which cloſely followed them, making all the haſte they could.
               This fight made him verily beléeue that thoſe villaines had betrayed him, and that thoſe Horſemen were they which entended to worke him miſchiefe, for whome hée purpoſeth to prouide, ſéeking his beſt aduauntage to continue the fighte, ſheltering himſelfe cloſe to a ſhrubbed Oliue Trée, which grewe thereby, diſtaunt from his Tent a furlong or thereabout, by which they muſt néedes paſſe that came to ſéeke him.
               
                  
The Moores approaching, making readie to take them firſt, which were the Authours of this ſtratageme, the Page with a Piſtolle killed the one, and the other whiche was his guide, with his Curtilex hée vnhorſed, dooing him no other harme. But perceiuing who hée was, thought to ſaue him aliue, to bee a guide for him, if hée eſcaped out of thoſe Mountaines, ſo binding him hande and foote, hée put a gagge in his mouth, and caſt him from him: which done, making readie to entertaine the reſt, hée ſpéedeth to his choſen Trée: where long hée had not ſtayed, but the others gallopping came as ſwiftly as they could, where finding the two Horſſes without men, made them ſtande, but to their coſt, for his Piſtolles being prouided, by them the foremoſt two loſt their liues. Which done, hée armed himſelfe to defence, euer annoying them as hée ſawe his moſt aduauntage, whileſt the Page with his Piſtolles did his part, paying ſurely all thoſe that hée made offer to hitte. A hardie broyle and daungerous fight endured this Noble Engliſh Knight, which for all their great multitudes was not diſmayed at all, but in the middeſt of his diſtreſſe, to the encouragement of his poore Page, cryed ſtill Lancaſter, Saint George for England, neuer making any ſhewe of diſcouragement, albeit his woundes were many, which bled moſte greeuouſly, yet ſtoode hée, to the great euerthrowe of them all, brauely and ioyfully encouraging himſelfe with hope of theyr ſhamefull downe-falles. In which ayded by him whome hée zealouſly ſerued, hée brought to confuſion, ſometimes aſſayling, ſometimes defending, as hée beſt could finde opportunitie, and greateſt aduauntage, euer ſpéeding one or other, ſo that hée neuer ſtrooke invaine.
               Continuing his dole with ſuch a kinde of deuotion, that the better part of their Army béeing ſlaine, and the moſte of the reſt lying grouelling for life, amongſt them, he eſpyed one of the verye principalleſt hauing on his A
                     •
                  mour,

who being none of the beſt men, ſéeing the others haue ſuch ill ſucceſſe, was flying as faſt as he could, but the Knight perceiuing him, got him to horſe, and ſo earneſtly followed him, that to his great coſt he ouertooke him, in ill time, as he might well witneſſe: for with ſuch authoritie he arreſted this run-away, that he had no leiſure to aſke at whoſe ſute, but being an execution, pawned his life for ſatiſfaction.
               This companion hauing his paſport to the great diuell, ſigned and ſealed by the hand of a noble Engliſh Knight, he armed him, and poaſting backe amongſt the reſt, payde them more then he owed, by many a Turkes life.
               By this time the day gaue him faire light, ſo that he might well ſée his worke, wherfore ſuch as could make ſhift for themſelues, ſéeing the ill ſucceſſe their fellowes had, ſtood not on any more poynts of manhood then was fit they ſhould, but without taking leaue, made what haſte they could for their ſafetie.
               The noble Edward ſéeing his companions gone, and none left able to make any reſiſtance, went to ſuruay them, which were all goodly fellowes, and well appointed after their faſhion, amongſt which, he found one Spanyard, who was newly taken in Turky, and turnde Turke: this fellowe had ſome knowledge of ye Knight, and was abiding in Gebraltare, when by the Turkes he was betrayed to the Gouernour. And in his company two Eaſterlings which had bene men of value and good worth, who hearing the Spanyard craue for pittie at his handes, hauing ſome hope to eſcape with life, cryed out vnto him, beſéeching him to heare them ſpeake, who being of kinde and noble condition, commanded them to ſay what they wold he would heare them.
               This comfort obtained, the Eaſterling bewayling their ill fortunes, which through the crueltie of the Turkes, were compeld to forſake their Sauiour, allured thereunto oft by threatning, and menaſed with gréeuous torments, and oft with promiſe of large poſſeſſions, ſo that in the ende to their great ſorrow and more ſhame of themſelues, they repented their fol
                     •
                  y and great ſinne committed againſt God, beſéeching the knight

to haue mercie vpon them, who being now in his hand, might either deliuer them by death from that ſting of conſcience, which continually gn

                  wed as the hungry Tyger on his prey, or graunting them life, accept them as his ſlaues, ſo that they might thorow a repentant minde, obtaine the fauour of God, whom ſo highly they had offended.
               With this pitifull ſuit, the Knight whoſe heart was alwaies inclined to mercie (moued with remorſe of ſauing their ſoules, whome none but he that gaue th

                  lpe of the Page, carried them vnto his lodging, where he played the Surgeon, binding and dreſſing theyr woundes: which done, with ſuch Balmes and eyntmens of rare worth, hée trimmed his owne gréefes, giuing God thankes for his ſafetie in thoſe extreames, and fréeing him from thoſe daungers, for the eaſe and recure of al which, hee made his ſtay there, ſome thrée or foure dayes, releaſing the Moore which lay bound, who ſerued to dreſſe theyr horſes, on whoſe examination, and the Eaſterlings, he had knowledge, that his intended euill proceded from the Baſhaw, who hyred the Ieneſaries of purpoſe to ſlay him, for whom God continually fought.

               How the Knight of the Croſſe-arriuing at Ioppa, through the treaſon of thoſe that fled, was there impriſoned.
               
                  WHen this moſt famous Knight, and myrrour of honour, had repoſed himſelfe with thoſe wounded people, ſome foure dayes, and had gotten ſtrength to trauaile, hée puruayed him for his iourney, and ſet forward as his way lay to Ioppa. To this place, ſ

                     ma, and other places, for ſtay of

the Knight in his paſſage. At this towne, the General no ſooner arriued, but by thoſe tokens was giuen, he was well knowne, and had entertainment by the Baſhawe, which ſate in the gate daylie, of purpoſe to entertaine ſuch trauailers as came.
               When the Knight had declared what he was, and his occaſion of trauaile, doing all cuſtomes that to the place appertained, deliuering his weapons, with which, no man being a ſtrā
                  ger, is ſuffered to enter, hauing him naked, and at aduantage with nothing to defend himſelfe, or offend them, the Baſhaw ſuffered him to enter the Towne, appointing his lodging as the cuſtome is to doo. But before he recouered the place, an vgly monſter of men, with a face as grieſtie as a Beare, came vnto him, accompanied with a traine of rakeſhames, which attended him, all weaponed: and laying violent hands vppon him, calling and reuiling him at his pleaſure, commanding him to go with him.
               The knight and his companie that ſaw this extremitie and wrong offered him, being now in ſuch a place, where it was booteleſſe to reſiſt them, hoping the beſt, yeelded himſelfe vnto theyr mercies, who caried him to a moſt vilde and ſtinking priſō where the roome was ſcarſty able to lodge two dogs, hauing nothing but the bare earth to lodge on, neither could he be ſuffered to haue any, his trunkes, bedding, and ſuch money and goods as he had, they confiſcated to the Baſhawes vſes, who would not depart with one oſpéere of his dutie.
               The knight in ſafetie, they laide hands on the page, who being a proper yong man, they ſought to haue him a Turke: But he who ſcorned his life, in regard of Gods fauour and loue, on which he builded, reſiſted all their deuiſes, ſometimes ſpeaking fayre, and other times, daring them to doo what they durſt, reſpecting nothing what they could d

                  uiſe to doo him harme, ſuch was his conſtancie and firme hope in God.
               The Spaniards and the two Eaſterlings, were fayne to ſticke ſtill to their olde conſortes for fauour, whome they woon with ſuch gentle ſpéeches, to fauour the knight, that they obtained leaue to bring him his vyands, which was ſo good as

any they could get for their monies, euer chéering him in his extremities, vowing themſelues his, ſo aſſured, that their liues ſhould be offered for their ſafetie, which comfort hee tooke ſo kindly, as if they had done him all the good hee could himſelfe deſire, promiſing a good requitall, if God euer releaſed him of thoſe troubles.
               Thus leaue we the noble Edward in his impriſonment, for a time: the Page to the fauour of the Baſhaw, and the Eaſterlings employing all their beſt power for his deliuerance, to let you heare of the lady Vallia, & her companie, what hapned thē.

               Howe the Emperour with all his traine, ſet forwardes from Rome, to conduct the Ladie Vallia vnto Rome.
               
                  THe Emperor hauing made the atonement with the Pope for his people, omitted no time for purueying all thinges, which might any wayes tend to his honour, or pleaſe his moſt noble friends ladie, whom in his abſence he tooke a princely care of, which ordained as he could beſt deuiſe, he diſpatched two noble men of his Court, with great preſents vnto her, to ſignifie his comming, which tooke the eaſier iourney, his age requiring it, cōmanding thoſe nobles to ſée each thing with ſuch honour to be furniſhed, as if himſelfe were preſent. With this charge the Nobles departed, deſirous to ſée the Ladie, of whō for her rare vertures, and moſt excellent graces was ſo much ſpoken of, as alſo for her Lordes ſake, whoſe followers in the Emperors wars they ſometimes were, delaieth no time for performance of what they intended: ſo as in very ſhort time they arriued at Cenita Vecha, & were ſuddenly brought to the ladies preſence, vnto whō doing all the reuerence they could, or as their countries vſe is, they declared the great care of the Emperor for her, the ioy he conceiued of

her ſafetie and good arriuall in his confines, and how much his deſired the preſence of her Lord and huſband, whoſe welfare he wiſhed as his own, and whoſe companie he more deſired, then all the Princes of the world. This ſaid, and the Lady returning heartie thanks for thoſe Princely fauours, as alſo for her honorable preſence, the nobles deſirous to be certified of ye knights ſafetie, beganne to queſtion with her of many ſundry matters, who were with ſuch wiſedome and honourable courteſie anſwered, that they admired her, giuing her the prayſe of all the Ladies that euer they had ſéene.
               The nobles delighting in her companie, neuer were ſatiſfied with her ſpéech, but as times conuenient ſerued, with much pleaſant parley and ſpéech of importance, as occaſiō was miniſtred, they paſſed the time two or thrée daies. After which tune, the Lady, who had often felt ſuch fits as to yong women are incident, though vnaccuſtomed with thoſe paſſions, and being acquainted with none but her Alinda, which had as ſmall ſkill in ſuch cauſes as her ſelfe, ſhe put that off often with good countenaunce, which beganne now to increaſe ſo on her, that ſhée could no longer hide: all which ſhe attributed to her trauaile, and ſuch other cares as ſhe endured, that to be aſſured of her diſeaſe, and to ſéeke reléefe for her, beeing in verie weake caſe, they acquainted the Phiſitian of the cardinall with her water, who by all his ſkill, found the cauſe no other, but bréeding child, for which hauing a carefull regard (commanded ſtricktly vnto it by his Lord) he preſcribed order of diet and gouernment for her, which he gaue with great charge vnto Alynda, to execute. In this carefull heauineſſe of the Ladies ſickneſſe, a meſſenger arriued at the pallace, which brought tidings of the Emperors comming, who was within halfe a dayes iourney, and meant God willing to ſim with them that night. At hearing of which, a great ſtir began in the citie, making all the preparation for his moſt honorable entertainment. The Cardinal with al his crew mounting themſelues, with all the nobles and burgeſſes of the Citie, in good and moſt commendable order, iſſued the Citie to méete him, at whoſe comming, ſuch a general ioy was ſéene in

euerie place, as of long time had not beene the like.

               The Emperour full of maieſtie and honour, making great ſhewes of heartie welcome to her and her people, moſt honourably entertained them, giuing thoſe Ladies and nobles of his countrey gracious thankes, in honouring him ſo much as they had done, in entertaining this welcome Lady to his countrey. Theſe welcomes of each ſide giuen, the time vntil ſupper was ready, they pleaſantly ſpent in diſcourſing of ſeuer all matters, the moſt part tending to the honour and high commendations of the knight of the Holy Croſſe, of whoſe vallor, courteſie, and reſolution, they all affirmed none could ſufficiently ſpeake. At hearing of which, ſuppoſe you Ladyes and women of what eſtéeme ſoeuer, that haue men of perſon, valour, and honour, endowed with many good parts, as this noble Edward, if Valia were proud yea or no, you are made iudges of her thoughts, which by your owne thoughts can beſt cenſure of hers, if ſhe be proude, it is not her fault, for by him his countries honour thorow the world is increaſed.

               How the Emperour taking care for the Ladie his charge, after great honour done vnto her, ſet forwards to Rome.
               
                  THe Emperour whoſe honourable thoughts was moſt in giuing due honour vnto the Ladie, was ioyfull in her preſence, but more ioyfull in that ſhe was with child, which he hoped ſhould haue his beginning in the world in his dominions, for whom as for the Ladie he was not a little carefull, taking an eſpeciall charge on himſelf, for her eaſie conuay to Rome, whither after ſome ſtay made, as well for the eaſe of his aged body, as for diſpatch of ſuch buſineſſe the lady had then in hand, when by his excellent bountie at her enterceſſion, the Marchants for their goods loſt, were ſatiſfied, and thoſe Chriſtian priſoners with good rewards ſet frée, and all things ſorted to ſuch happie euent as ſhe deſired, euerie one content, and the Emperour beſt pleaſed in his charge, hearing by generall report, her moſt godly behauiour, and her reſolute courage, in their and her owne defence, louingly embracing her, he ſayth: welcome the flower of womanhood, to thine owne Empire, where thou ſhalt not liue to be commaunded, but to command: whatſoeuer I poſſeſſe, in all places where I haue any command: therfore honourable Ladie, ſet feare and care apart, and frolicke it with thoſe whoſe care is now for you and your welfare.
               For whoſe gracious offers, Vallia rendered her moſt hearty thankes, beſéeching God to endue her Lord with life, and ſafe returne to Rome, that hee might acknowledge the like.
               This finiſhed, the Emperour commaunded to prepare for their iourney, which was in all readineſſe againſt the next morning, when with all the honour might be ſhewen, ſhee

was accompanied, with all the eſtates of the countrey, both Ladyes and others: at whoſe departing the citie, great gifts were preſented vnto her, which ſhe moſt thankfully accepted, and the Emperour for her ſake moſt honourably and bountifully required.
               Thus leauing the citie of old Rome, by verie eaſie iourneyes they procéede, paſſing the way with all deuiſes might be procured, to beguile the wearineſſe of the iourney, as hauking, hunting, and other paſtimes and pleaſing diſcourſes, in which, the Emperour deſirous to knowe of what countrey ſhe was, for that ſhee ſpake his owne language ſo perfectly, required it at her hande as an eſpeciall fauour, which Vallia with great reuerence and courteſie aunſwered, diſcourſing bréefely vnto him the long and heartie affection ſhee bore him, béeing but a ſtranger, and how ſhe left her fathers court, with her woman then attending on her, diſguiſed both in mans attyre, not omitting his deliuerance frō the Spaniſh impriſonment, with all their procéedings, vntill their marriage. Which wonderfull diſcourſe the Emperor was neuer wearied to heare: when ſhe had all finiſhed, with ſuch heartie loue and more zealous affection, if more might be, kiſſing her tender chéekes, which he bedewed with his teares, procéeding from the entire ioy of his moſt honorable hart, he ſaith. Thou lamp of honor, & wonder of ye earth, how may thy moſt deſerued praiſes be eternized as they merit? my noble friend in ſo honourable a child, and thy country thriſe happie is renowmed wherein thou hadſt thy being: bleſſed by ye loynes from whence thou procéedeſt, & a world of happineſſe betide thoſe, whoſe tender paps gaue thée nouriſhment. Honorable friend duke Philip, happy father, eternally ſhal thy name liue, in this gracious and noble child: oh Philip, ioy of thy louing friends and kin, didſt thou know thy daughter, whom long ſithence it may be, thou reckoneſt among the dead, where liuing and ſo neare thee, what ioy would it bring thy drooping aged heart: Me thinkes I ſée thy ſprites how they would ſkip, to heare thy Vallia liueth, which thou ſhalt know, with ſuch ſpéede as I beſt may, or can giue thee notiſe thereof,

if you gracious Ladie ſay▪ Amen, to what I intend. Vallia ſeeing the ioy of the Emperour, for her fathers good, could not forbeare ſhedding teares at his kind offers: which paſſing ouer as ſhe beſt could, proſtrating her ſelfe, ſhe in all humblenes, beſought his Maieſtie, to thinke howe much ſhe had incurred her fathers high diſpleaſure ſo to leaue him, without giuing any notice of her departure to any one, which ſhe doubted would neuer be recouered without his ſpeciall ſuit, which if by his moſt honourable meanes ſhe did obtaine, how ſhe ſhoulde hold her ſelfe bleſſed of God, and honoured of his highneſſe, modeſtie cauſed her conceale: vewing by the honour of her huſbands name, that all the fauour he could do her, was not, neither could it be ſo acceptable vnto her as this.
               The Emperour noting her heauineſſe for her fathers diſpleaſure, comforted her all he might, aſſuring her on his honour, to recouer what ſhe required. And calling for pen, ynke, and paper, wrote as followeth.
               
                  
                     
                        To the moſt gracious and noble Prince Philip, Duke of Genoway, and Naples, health, and continuall happineſſe.
                     
                     
                        THriſe honoured Duke, a longing deſire hath mooued vs oftentimes, ſince our laſt being togither, to ſee your excellencie: but the conſideration of your age and imbecilitie, vomeete for tr

Therefore, if thou reioyce in her happineſſe, as thy age, and abilitie will giue leaue, come vnto vs, who in perſon, will accompany you to her preſence, who as we here, groneth with the pains of another, as our phiſitions enforme vs. And ſo expecting what we deſire from you, we bid you heartilie farewell. At our imperial court, ſigned with our royal ſignet.

Then calling one of his Nobles, which was graue, and of honourable account, he deliuered the ſame, with eſpeciall charge, for the ſpéedie conuay thereof, and ſecret conſcealing of the Ladie. Which done (commending him to his iourney, and good performance of his charge) hee bid him farewell, whom we leaue to his trauaile, and the Emperour and the Lady, vnto theyr pleaſure, vntill her time of deliuerance, of which you ſhall here, as ſoone as the midwife hath done her office.

               How the Knight of the Croſſe, by the induſtrie of the two eaſterlings and the page was freed from priſon, and what chanced to them.
               
                  THe Noble Edward cloyed with his miſhaps, and harſh vſage in his impriſonmēt, thought euery moneth a yeare, and euerie minute a moneth, vntil he was at libertie. Oftentimes perſwading himſelfe to great hazard in fréeing him from that captiuitie: And then by intreatie of thoſe, one whoſe truſt he relied his determinations ceaſed,

attending his pleaſure, which neuer left him without comfort, his poore followers dooing for him what they could. But as long looked for, comes at laſt, ſo the time of his deliuerie drawing nie, and euerie thing effected ſecurely, his guides by whome hee was to be ruled, pretending a iourney to Sylo, obtained his horſe and armour of the baſhaw, for a preſent to their Baſhaw, from whence they came, which cloſely they conuaied away out of the citie, to a place of ſeacreci
                     •
                  , which they in their idle walke had founde, leauing the Page in his lodging, which was in a Iewes houſe verie ſecret. For the Page they ordained Turkiſh attire, and him furniſhed very orderly, with a counterfeit muſtacho, the better to diſguiſe him for béeing known, hauing another for the knight, vnto whom before their going they had imparted their deuiſe, which was ſo ſlay his keeper that euening, when he came to bring him water, and in his apparrell to eſcape, appoynting him a place without the Citie, where they with the Page would tarrie his comming. This done, firſt conuaying the page in his attire, which eſcaped the watch without ſuſpect: they ſought the gaylour, of whome pretending to take a ſolemne farewell, they carryed him to a Baniard, a place where the Chriſtian Captiues were kept, plying him ſo with Aqua vitae, or as they call it Rakcaye, that hée forgot himſelfe, that with kindnes and ſhewes of loue, they procured him to the priſon, to take their leaue of ye knight, wherein the kéeper was no ſooner entred, but the Eaſterlings thinking that the fitteſt time, gaue him ye word to make him away, whilſt they kept ſure guarde for his ſafetie. By whoſe d

                  one, his companions ſéeing all well effected, made no long ſtay, but preſently followeth, and brought him vnto the

taue, where the Page with the Spaniard and Moore ſtayed: they preſently mounted themſelues, and away they go, prayſing God for his deliuerance. The haſte was made, is not to be forgotten, who neuer ceaſed gallowping vntill they came farre without daunger of the Towne, where night ouertaking them, they found place fit for their purpoſe, where they alighting, gaue God prayſe, and refreſhed themſelues awhile. Here the knight armed himſelfe with his armour, girding his ſword of great woorth cloſe to his ſide, which doone, they againe mounted themſelues, and taking a courſe as they thought, farre from ſight of any theyr olde acquaintance, or keeping any readie way for feare of entercepting, they trauailed by ayme. Two dayes, and ſome, what more well neare was ſpent, ſince their comming from Ioppa, when they met with a Moore, borne neare Algeere, in Barbarie, who comming from Myca (the place wher their Prophet Mahomet was buried) was that day ſpoyled by a rout of Arabian theeues, which kept thoſe moūtains. Of thoſe ſpoyling people, the Moore warn
                     •
                  d the knight and his company who were all diſmaide at his tydings: yet by the moſt noble knight comforted, relying on his vallour, more then theyr owne manhood, they proceeded, trauailing all that day, yet neuer heard any newes of them. The next morning, the knight hauing taken ſome extraordinarie ſleep, it was long before they putte forward, when they had not ridden by theyr account one league, but they eſpied a crewe of horſemen which were ſo farre from them, on the ſide of a huge mountaine, as they coulde well deſearne. This ſight cauſed the companie to doubt of ſome enſuing euill, which the knight perceiuing, againe incouraged them, ſo comforting thoſe his companions with his ſpéeches, that they caſt al feare apart, to take part with him that was not to be dared with euerie naked bug. In this mind continuing, theſe faint hearts looking about them often in their trauaile (for feare they ſhuld be backed) they eſpied another rout, which had them in chaſe, acquainting the knight withal, of whō he took little care, but cōmanded them

to holde on their way eaſily, that if they followed them, they might ouertake them, before the formoſt could come to helpe them.
               Long had they not ridden, following the knights directions, but one of the gallants that purſued them, was come forward with them, who viewing their ſtrength, which he ſuppoſed was far to weake to encounter them, began in ſcoffing tearmes to flout them, eſpecially the knight which he ſaw armed.
               
                  Edward, which brooked all offences vnwittingly committed, and curteouſly reconciled, ſéeing the peremtorie doings of this baſe groome, drawing néere vnto him, ſaid. Baſe fugitiue, who was thy ſchoolmaiſter that learned thée no more good: here after when thou chanceſt to méet ſtrangers, ſalute them with more curteſie. And therewith all lifting vp his Battelaxe, gaue him ſo ſound a blow on the head, as the brains ſtarted about his horſe necke. And he hauing no power to ſit, forſooke his horſe, falling dead vnder his feet. His companie which ſaw him fall, and had noted the blow he receiued, gan all at once to aſſaile the knight, bending their launces vpon his breaſt, which like a man of power, and policie, he cunningly awarded, and drawing his curtelar, which before he had bathed in the luke warme gore of many thoſe helhounds, he ſo behaued himſelf, that in few hours he left not many of them to ſtand: but leauing their horſes maiſterleſſe, exchanged ſuch as they be
                     •
                  t fancied, and left the reſt to their owne libertie. The other companie, which from the top of the mountain had feene the feats of Armes done by the knight, thinking to reſcue thoſe that liued, and to reuenge thoſe that were ſlaine, came amaine vpon them, ſparing not their horſe ſides from the ſpurs, to learne them a ſwifter pace, (but in ill time) to ſoone came they to the after reckoning: for they were faine to pay the hoſt, who gaue them ſuch entertainment, as they had neuer power to depart from him, ſo honeſtly did this honour of knighthood deale with them, whom he found ſo cruel without cauſe offered them. In this companie there were foure Portugall marchants, whoſe Camils theſe villaines had ſpoyled, taking their goods, and kept them captine, intending to ſell

them as ſlaues, to the firſt caua
                     •
                  liers of that countrey. Theſe Marchants being vnder the charge of their horſe-kéepers, left far off, ſéeing the ill ſucceſſe of the robbers, made way for themſelues, recouering ſuch weapons as the ſlaues had, from whō being cleare, they mainly followed the knight, crying vnto him for ſuccor, and earneſtly beſéeching his fauor, which the knight perceiuing, cauſed the reſt to ſtay, ſpurring his horſe to méete them, to giue them reſcue from the ſlaues that purſued them, from whom they fled with all the haſt they could make, but with too ſlow ſpéed, for ſome of them were faine to ſtay behind their legs being too weake to carrie theyr bodies. The knight returning from ſpoil of thoſe ſlaues, enquired of the marchants of whence they were, they anſwered of Portugall, and were bound for traffique, with an hundred Camils laden with ſpice and ſilke for Conſtantinople, of all which they had béene ſpoyled by theſe villaines, of which fraternitie, there was as many more as he had ſlaine. The knight which ſaw the heauie countenance of the poore Marchants, could not forbeare to pittie them, & commanded them to horſe themſelues, vpon the beſt of theirs which he had ſlaine, which done, taking care for their reléefe of vittailes, for their horſes, and for themſelues, they were conducted to the place, where the ſtore of thoſe theeues lay, where th

               How the Baſhaw of Ioppa miſſing his priſoner, purſued him, and how he eſcaped.
               
                  NOw the couetous Baſhaw, which had the cuſtodie of this honourable knight, was perſwaded by the Eaſterlings his friends, that the Baſhaw of Silo, would giue for his priſoner, tenne hundred thouſand Duckats. In hope of which, at their earneſt ſuites he kept him aliue, ſending his horſe, armour, and furniture by them, vnto their Baſhaw for a preſent (as beſore you haue heard) but when he miſſed the Knight, the Page, and thoſe Runagates, he was like in choler to haue ſlaine himſelfe, by deſperation to ſend his ſoule to the Diuell before his time, from which extremitie, no perſwaſion of his beſt and deareſt friendes, might any way preuaile, but that in a furie he would miſchiefe himſelfe, ſéeing that by his too much truſt, he was ſo deceiued of a priſoner, and a be
                     •
                  fellow of ſo much worth, as the Knight and his Page, whom he intended to yéeld to his pleaſure.
               The Baſhaw which fared in ſuch frantike maner, bethinking him of all the Diueliſh practiſes could bee intended, called to minde an auncient Nigromancer, which kept in the Mountaines, betwéene Ioppa and Rama, in the way to Ieruſalem. By this good fellow he thought to be reuenged, what ſoeuer it coſt him, and ſo comforting himſelfe in that hope, hee ceaſeth his raging furie, diſpatching two of his beſt approoued friendes in ſearch of this diueliſh practiſer, who vſed ſuch diligence in their buſineſſe, that in ſhort time they found him, in whom this Baſhaw repoſed his whole confidence for reuenge.
               This diuell incarnate, they intreated with all curteſie, and

beſt pleaſing ſpeeches they could frame, to go with them to Ioppa, to the Baſhaw, promiſing great ſummes of golde for his paine. But all th

                   of this Archdiuell, vnto the Baſhaw made knowne by his friends, though he were in mind grieued at his denial, yet he wiſely conſidered, how vainly he ſhould ſpend his time in ſéeking reuenge on him. Wherefore, without any further trouble (accompanied with a garriſon of Ieneſaries, and his two friends for his guides) he ſet forward froin Ioppa, and in time conuenient, came before the Caue, where the Nigromancer kept, who knowing of his cōming, thought to be ſomewhat pleaſant with him, to trie his manhood. Whē the Baſhaw had a while attended, & ſaw none ſtirring vnto whō to ſpeake, he commanded a ſouldier to knocke: which done the Cuniurer tranſformed into the likeneſſe of a monſtrous diuell, breathing 
                     •
                  lames of fire from his noſtrils, came out vnto thē, whoſe vgly ſhape cauſed them all to ſuch feare, that they wiſhed thēſelues again in Ioppa, and were ready to take their héeles to be gone. But ſéeing their timerouſneſſe, hee tooke another way from them, and inuiſibly returned into his caue.
               Once againe making triall what was in them, tooke on him the forme of a little goate, thinking they woulde bee doing therewith, if any occaſion ſhould be offered them. To preuent therefore what danger in this diſguiſe might inſue, he annoynted his head and body with an oyntment, which ſo hardned his ſkin, that no weapon wou
                     •
                  d pearce it.
               This done, he iſſued againe amongſt them, which durſt not knocke anie more. And approching neare the Baſhaw himſelfe, began furiouſly to fling fire vppon him: which his companie ſéeing, armed them to his defence, whom the ſuppoſed goate euer aſſailed with fire, ſometime flinging on him ſo furiouſly, as hee woulde teare him in peeces, manie times clawing him, that he enforced him to runne away, leauing his meſſage to do for which he came.
               
                  
This coniurer when he had plaids his part with him, and ſaw that he would be gone, thought to ſpeake with him, to ſée how he liked his entertainment, and ſhifting him to his wearing apparrell, met him on the way, as if he had no knowledge of his being there.
               The Baſhaw his kinſmen which did know him well, when firſt they had ſight of him, ſhewed the Baſhaw, who comming towards him, after the countrey faſhion ſaluted him, and alighting from his horſe, bréefely tolde him the cauſe of his comming, beſeeching his fauour and helpe for recouerie of the loſt knight, for which he promiſed to reward him to his content.
               The ſorcerer which ſaw the enuie of the Baſhaw in hope of gaine, promiſed him to do what art could, for accompliſhing his will, crauing reſpit of time foure or fiue dayes, that hee might finde what way he tooke, which ſaid, and they both thervpon agréeing, they take leaue each of other, whom to their diuelliſh practiſe we leaue, returning to the Ladie Vallia.

The recounting of each particular I omit,

The noble man which imagined how heauie the newes he had to report, would be to his highneſſe, and all the hearers, humbly beſought the Emperour to heare in ſecret what he had to deliuer, which the Emperour graunted, withdrawing himſelfe of purpoſe, which done, he ſaith.
               Tell me (noble friend) what chance hath befallen thée in this trauell of thine, and how fareth our honorable friend the duke. Gracious liege, and my deare Lord, anſwered this noble gentleman, to kéepe from your highneſſe, what you muſt know in time, though with a heart full fraught with griefe, it cumbreth me greatly, to become the heauie meſſenger of ſuch tragicke newes. Know (moſt excellent Prince) the duke hath left this life, to ſéeke the ioyes of the heauenly Hierarchie. The Emperour whoſe thoughts were ſurpriſed with heauineſſe, hearing his long deferred anſwere to his queſtions, breathing out manie ſighes at the deliuerie of the ſame, with ſighes and bitter teares (after he had a while lamented, with many mournefull cries, and pitifull ſhréekes, the Dukes death) he ſtraitghly chargeth the noble man, to deliuer vnto him the time of his departure from this world, and the cauſe: whether of any old griefe, or ſuddaine action: commaunding him (all dread ſet a part) to tell the truth.

               How the Knight of the holy Croſſe, accompanied with the Portugals, and his other companions iournied to the citie of Ieruſalem, and what happened them.
               
                  WHen the noble Edward had by his proweſſe, and honourable feates of Armes, by death of thoſe miſcreants, releaſed the Portugall Marchants from theyr captiuitie, ſtoring themſelues with ſuch needfull prouiſion, as they coulde conueniently carrie. They ſpedde themſelues with all the haſte they could, to end their deſired buſineſſe, and fulfill their vowes in the holie Citie, kéeping the way continually by the Mountanes, without any aduenture happening, vntill one of the Eaſterlings, fell into ſuch daunger of death, that there was no way to recouer him, which the pittifull Knight perceyuing, and hoping the beſt for his recouerie, making his ſtay to ſée the end, what would become of him, hée applyed himſelfe by all meanes to ſéeke his recouerie, which was paſt all remedie. In which extremitie, our braue Engliſh Caualere, playing the part of a heauenly Phiſitian, comforted his weake patient, in the promiſes of Chriſt Ieſus, and his paſſion, earneſtly perſwading him, to remember his time euill ſpent in this worlde, and howe manie and grieuous ſinnes hee had committed for any daunger, or hope of worldly promotions, to forſake his Sauiour, whoſe mercies was more to bée regarded, then a legion of liues, or all the Kingdomes of the worlde.
               In which comfortable wordes the diſtreſſed Eaſterling taking great pleaſure, when the houre came of his lateſt farewell to the worlde, embracing the Knight betwéene his armes, when his faltring tongue had loſt the vſe of ſpéech

he ſhewed by ſignes, the hopes he had to be a copartner of the heauenly kingdome, and therwithall refined his breath, whom after the Chriſtian manner in thoſe mountaines, they entered as they beſt could, which done (forrowing for the loſſe of him whom from death they coule not recall) they procéede on their iourney, in which they had not long trauailed, but reſting themſelues in the deſarts by a pleaſant riuers ſide. The Moore which before hee had taken to attende their horſes, diſcryed comming with great ſpéede towards them, a verie faire and beautifull woman, attired in a petticoate of crimſon damaſke, which was purſued by two Negroes ſlaues, which would violently haue abuſed her bodie. This ſtrange ſight in a place ſo vncouth, when the Moore had ſhewed the knight, like himſelfe mooued with pittie of diſtreſſed people, eſpecially of her ſexe, preſently mounted himſelfe, and met her, whom he queſtioned of whence ſhe was, and what moued her to flie ſo ſwiftly from thoſe villians. The Lady whom feare had almoſt doomed to death, being in a gréeuous extaſie, could not forbeare to ſhewe the ſine of ioy by her ieſture, albeit her heart reſtrained her tongue ſpéech, which the knight perceiuing, taking her in his armes, and brand aſhing his ſword, thereby ſhewing to reuenge her wrong, he comforted her in ſuch wiſe, as taking aſſured hope on him, which ſéemed by his habite to bee a chriſtian, ſhe ſaid. Honourable knight, whom God hath rayſed for the comfort of a poore diſtreſſed captiue, know that I am wife vnto a noble Grecian knight, called Mathatias, gouernour of Roades, who trauailing with a ſmall traine to performe our religious vowes in the holy Citie, now two nights paſt, taking our lodging in theſe deſarts, our tents pitched, and our guard hauing fire, as wel for our vſe, to dreſſe and make ready our viands, as to defend themſelues from the wilde beaſts that haunt theſe mountaines, a crew of cruell and moſt brutiſh heathen, that kéepe theſe places to diſturbe the quiet of ſuch paſſengers as they met, guided by the fire (as I ſaid) came vnto our tents, whilſt wee ſléeping, dreaded neither them, nor any other euill. By thoſe catiues was my moſt noble huſband ſlaine, and ſuch

                  cious ornament which all good Women holde in more regarde then then theyr life: yet preſerued by Gods fauour, my teares and pittious cryes did ſo penetrate the hearts of thoſe homicides, that they haue pardoned mée that ill, vntill theyr returne from a ſpoyle which they haue vndertaken, meaning to viſite theyr home within thrée or foure dayes, leauing mee to the cuſtodie of their Villaines, who with more villanie haue menaced mée to obtaine theyr pleaſures, from whome hauing eſcaped by flight, I intreate you, that ſheweth to be of gentle image, if thou bee no worſe then thou ſéemeſt, eyther to preſerue my chaſtitie from theyr rape by flaying mee, or like thy ſelfe, defende my innocencie, by auenging me on thoſe accurſed villaines that purſue me.
               The Knight which during her long talke, had noted her geſture and modeſt demeanour, vttering her ſadde lament, pittying her diſtreſſe ſayde. Gentle Ladie, thy diſtreſſe my heart pittyeth, ſéeing thée in this vnfrequented place, ſo hardly beſette with companions of baſe conditions, of whome feare not, for my ſelfe by the power of him that ſent mée for thy comfort, will ſo reuenge thy iuſt cauſe, as well on theſe, as on theyr maiſters, as they ſhall neuer take pleaſure in wronging a Ladie anie more: and thereon aſſure you, as I am a Knight and a Chriſtian. And without taking longer pawſe, willing the Ladie to ſtaye her there, without dread of any man, he mounted his horſe, and with his Sworde purſued the villaines, who fearing him, fl

thanking God for her deliueraunce, rendered the like to the noble knight, vnto whome proſtrating her ſelfe, ſhee ſubmitted the care of her ſafetie, beſéeching him as hee was a knight at armes, not to diſhonour her, nor to leaue her vntill hée came where Chriſtians inhabited. Vnto which, gaging his honour, by many ſolemne oathes, hee tooke her from the grounde, comforting her with all kindneſſe, proteſting withall, that he would not leaue thoſe deſarts vnſought, vntill hee founde the dead bodie of her Lorde, to interre him with Chriſtian rites, and reuenge his death on the robbers.

                  ounde ſuch vnexpected comfort in her diſtreſſe, after ſhée hadde with many kinde requitalles of friendſhippe, and ſhewes of loue, gratified the knight, breaking her from her proteſtations, hée cauſed her to mount his horſe, conducting her to his Tentes, where theyr dinner, by thoſe that helde him in more regarde then thier owne liues, was prepared, vnto whome the Ladie was welcome, wanting nothing of theyr ſtore which was needfull, nor ſuch honours as to her eſtate required. In this better content wée leaue them a while, with ſundrie diſcourſes to beguile the time, to lette you knowe of theyr further aduentures.

               Howe the Knight of the Holy Croſſe in ſearch of the dead body of Mathatias, gouernour of Roades, found him aliue, with other aduentures.
               
                  THe remaine of that day and the night following they ſpent in repoſing themſelues, the knight after he had taken ſuch directions for his courſe in ſearch of the Gouernour, her huſband, as ſhe could giue, puruaying them of victuals for two dayes prouiſion, accompanied with two of the Porttugall marchants, taking leaue of the Ladie, and commending the truſt of her ſafetie vnto the reſt of his followers, he left them: poſting from mountaine to mountain, prying and vewing where hee could diſcerne any Tent, or ſhew of any. So long rid he in this manner, that in the euening, about the going downe of the Sunne, hee might diſcrie a troupe of Camilles laden, guarded with thrée or foure naked mountenaries, to theſe the knight ſpedde him in all the haſte, making ſuch way, that hée ſoone ouertooke them, whome encountring, hée ſayde. Tell me villaines of whence yee are, yea, and where had yée theſe Camilles with thoſe marchandize in your kéeping. The villaine mounteners hearing the knight vſe theſe ſpéeches, vttered with a hoarſe voyce and a looke threatning death, trembling as though they were readie to receiue their iudgement and preſent execution of life, kiſſing firſt the grounde, and after his féete, beſought him to take compaſſion of them, relating in what ſort they hadde the Camilles, which they hadde taken from others which hadde them in charge, belonging to thoſe Theeues which hadde ſpoyled the Lady of her huſband.
               
                  
The knight vnderſtanding by theyr talke that they could giue him notice of the ſpoyled bodyes, queſtioned them further, commaunding them on paine of theyr liues, to tell him where the Chriſtians were, that were lately maiſters of thoſe Camilles, in dooing which theyr liues ſhould goo vntouched, or otherwiſe they ſhould there finiſh their daies.
               The villaines which would more willingly haue béene further off, when they ſawe their liues was to bee ſaued for a matter of ſuch ſmall importaunce with them, ſayde. The ſunne hath not yet two times declined his power, ſince certaine Chriſtians trauailing theſe mountaines, were encountred by robbers, that haue their continuall béeing not farre off, who ſlaying the people, left theſe Camilles and goods in poſſeſſion of their ſlaues to conduct them to theyr caue, which wee haue ſlaine, and humbly beſéech thée of pardon.
               Recreants (quoth the knight) you ſhall not ſo eſcape me, but you ſhall likewiſe die, if you bring me not preſently to the place where thoſe ſlaughtered bodyes lie, wherefore I aduiſe you doo this and liue, or denying it receiue your deaths.
               The villaines which ſawe howe booteleſſe it was to perſwade, yéelded theyr conſentes, and haſtned with ſo good ſpeede, that they ſhortly arriued at the place, where they founde the mangled carcaſes of the flaine Chriſtians, weltering in their gore.
               This pittifull ſight mooued the knight of the Croſſe to much ruth and ſorrow for their deaths, yet knowing howe booteleſſe teares are to call againe the dead, diſmounting himſelfe, hee ſuruayed the bodyes, turning, and ſo often toſſing, to ſearch the body of the dead gouernour, that with often remouing hee founde it, and viewing his perſonage, noting each linament, with his countenaunce, ſhewing a man of proweſſe, bedewing his bloudie face with his warme teares, hee might perceiue a panting breath to poſſeſſe

him, vnto which taking good héede, waſhing his face, and clearing it from the congealed bloud, hee opened his iawes, powring into his mouth, of that wine which he brought for his prouiſion, and after rubbing & chafing his vytall powers, hee recouered his life: ſo comforting him with the heat of his hands, rubbing and other carefull handling, that his ſpirit waxing ſtrong, his tongue had ſome vſe, when looking gaſtly vp, as one reuiued from a new world, hée called for his Ladie, and miſſing her, taking good notice of the Knight, which was a ſtraunger vnto him, he thus ſaid. Noble Gentlemen, and my fréendes, what you are I know not, neither can I remember that euer I haue had any friendſhip with you, yet as you are Gentlemen, tell me of my Ladie, what is bec

                  me of her, whether aliue or dead? next, what you are, whether fréendes, or thoſe that brought me to this miſerie?
               The Knight whoſe heart was ouercome with ſuddain ioy, beholding the ſuppoſed dead to liue, and ſpeak, anſwered: worthie and noble Gouernor of that moſt honoured Iland, know, we are Chriſtiās as you are who hearing of thy diſtreſſe, haue vndertaken to finde thy body, ſuppoſed to be ſlaine, by ſpoylers of ſuch as paſſe theſe mountaines, and here haue their reſidēce. Thy Lady I haue receiued from their tyrannie, and on their liues, haue reuenged the euill offered, by them vnto her, and by my maker, whoſe ſouldiour I am vowed, will not depart theſe deſarts, vntill I be acquited, of all your wrongs, or looſe my life in your cauſes. Therefore take comfort, and thanke God for your ſafetie, whom I doubt not, but will be ſo gracious to reſtore you: your wounds I will vndertake by Gods grace to recure, and deliuer in ſafetie your loue and Ladie: who liuing, dyeth with very ſorrowe for your great miſhap. The Gouernour hearing this comfort, well noating the manlike countenance and corage of the Knight, bending himſelfe vnto him, rendered many heartie thankes for thoſe kinde fauoures, and embracing the Knight as his weake arms would giu
                     •
                   him leaue, proteſted by the faith and honour of armes, for euer to become a firme freende and faithful coepartner

of his aduentures, ſo pleaſed him to accept of his loue and fellowſhip.
               The Knight whome no Spaniard could match, eyther in courteſie or honour of Armes, taking his proffered loue as kindlie as they were offered, gaue him many heartie thankes. Then dreſſing his woundes with ſuch comfortable Balmes as he had, and binding them ſafe, they horſed him, pacing eaſily towardes the place where his company made their ſtay: where by the prouidence of him, who is the ſtrength and conduct of all thoſe that truſt in him, they arriued in ſafetie, though not before they were lookt for, accompanied with their tenis, camills, and their carriages, to the excéeding ioy of the Ladie, and the vnſpeakable comfort of all his owne followers. Theyr fréendly embraſings, and other talke of their fortunes, paſſing betwéene the Gouernour and his Lady, I omit: to recount what other aduentures happened to them.
            
            
               
               CHAP. XVIII.
               How the Knight of the Holy Croſſe, accompanied with the Eaſterling and his Page, followed the robbers: with his aduenture.
               
                  FAmous Edward, the honour of his countrey, whoſe vallour was not not to bee matched, helde his countreyes reputation in more regarde then his life, whereon now ſtanding, ſcorning the Spaniards braues, or the ſcandall that might enſue by his report, if hee ſhould leaue them in ſuch wiſe without reuenge, which he had promiſed: wherefore preferring his noble word, early in the morning, according to the directions he had giuen, taking leaue of the gouernour and his Ladie, accompanied with his Page and the Eaſterling, he ſette forward in ſearch of thoſe bloudie minded reprobates, following the direction of one of the villaines he had laſt taken, whom he taketh for his guide, all that day riding without any aduenture hapning, yet wearied with trauaile, deſirous to refreſh himſelfe with taking ſome ſléepe, hee cauſed his Tent to bee prepared, and his viandes to bee ordained: and when hee had refreſhed himſelfe, not daring to committe the truſt of his perſon, to ſo vile a ſlaue, which was not to be truſted. After theyr horſes were vſed as they ought, he commaunded the ſlaue to be bounde, taking order with his companie that one ſhould watch whilſt the other ſlept, and to take diligent care of their welfares, that they were not ſurpriſed at vnawares.
               This charge the carefull attendaunts faythfully kept and performed, the day appearing, they looſed the Villaine from his bondes, ordering the horſes and each thing

in readineſſe: which done, they awaked the Knight, who ſéeing the morning well ſpent, was not long preparing, but haſtning with all the ſpéede he might, betooke him to his intended purſuit of thoſe homecides. So long they trauailed, that ye heat of the day encreaſing, they alighted, and ſeating them cloſe on the banke of a pleaſant riuer (taking ſuch viands as they had, merrily ſpending the time with pleaſant parlie) they might perceiue thoſe gallants, who returning from the death of a heathen Prince, and ſpoyle of his people, miſſing their Ladie, vowed by all their gods neuer to ſurceaſe their trauaile, vntill they had recouered knowledge of her. For which, courſing like men poſſeſt with a furie in purſuite of the Ladie, the knight hath gained his deſires, who requi
                     •
                  ing of the ſlaue what they were, mounted on ſuch ſwift courſers: he recounted vnto him what they were, aduiſing him to regarde himſelfe, and to flie while he had time, for that they were many, and men of great puiſſance, hauing done many great outrages, and ſurpriſed ſundry troupes of gallant men, trauailing that way. Peaſant (quoth the knight) it is not thy ſpéech of their valour that can daunt me, or cauſe me to turne my backe, vpon thoſe diueliſh companions. But as I am a Knight, and a true Engliſh man, or euer haue hope to beholde my natiue Country, were they a thouſand to my ſelfe alone, armed as I am, in the name of my God, and hope of my rightful cauſe, I would aſſaile them. And ſo arming himſelfe, chearing his Page, and his aſſociates, hee mounted his horſe, couching his ſtaffe in his reſt, he put forwardes to meete the companie of robbing théeues, who was no ſooner eſpied of them, but without word ſpeaking moſt furiouſly they all aſſailed him, who were all ſo well reſiſted, and ſo eagerly encountred of the Knight, as they had ſmall cauſe to boaſt them of their gaines. Euerie blow, with blow, redoubled this noble Brytaine on the robbers, doing ſuch feates of honor and chiualrie, that it amazed them to ſee: but more terrified they were, that muſt of force abide his furie, who ſparing not his ſtrength, laide on them with ſuch courage, crying Saint George, that after many ſharpe alarums on either

part, many of th
                     •
                  n were ſent to ſéeke their paſſeports in hell. Thus our noble knight encouraged with the hope of victorie, ſo behaued himſelfe, that they were all well neare brought to ende. The Captaine of which route, with foure others his confederates, being men of valour, and reſolution, ſéeing the maſſacre of their companie, ſought to reuenge their bloods with their greateſt power. And encloſing him on each ſide, layde about them in ſuch manner, that the Knight was by them greatlie endaungered. In this aſſault was his horſe ſlaine, when fighting a foote, eſpying his beſt aduauntage, he gored their horſes as they came, and gaue them that their mothers neuer prouided for them: yet in deſpite of what hee coulde doo, as the mightieſt manie times bee forced to yéelde, fighting on the grounde, and in the greateſt daunger of life. The Page which ſingled himſelfe from the broyle, wherein hée left the Eaſterling, beſtirred him, whereby hee had leaue to breathe, and being ſomewhat refreſhed, reaching violently one of the robbers by the legge, pulled him perforce from his horſe, mounting himſelfe thereon, and daſhing out his maiſters braines with his héeles.
               The Knight nowe againe mounted, ſo beſtirred him, in that the moſt braueſt of them that liued, coulde well haue affoorded to béene further off, but they which are bounde muſt obey. The game was nowe vied, and they muſt néedes ſée it. So long vied and reuied was it by the Knight, that not one was left to count the ſtake.
               The broyle ended, and euerie act in this maſſacre performed, the Knight beholding thoſe brauing hell-houndes, weltering in their blood, firſt thanking God for his fauour, in ſtrengthening him in that diſtreſſe, reſting himſelfe after his wearie trauaile, hee diſarmed himſelfe, refreſhing his wearie bodie for a time: which done, he haſteneth him vnto the place where they Gouernour and his Ladie remained, whom in the companie of his beloued wife was comforted, where with great ioy he was welcomed, to all his folowers, who with the Ladie, ceaſed not to pray for his good ſucceſſe.

               How the Lady Vallia, ſorowing for the death of her father, trauelled with childe, and what then chanced her.
               
                  NOwe the time and place of the Hyſtorie ſerueth vs to leaue the noble Edwarde and his companie, to let you heare of the vertuous Ladie Vallia, who trauailing with womens ordinarie griefe, had not long to looke of her time, wherein ſhee expected an heyre ſo the woorthie knight of the Croſſe: which cauſed the Emperour to detaine the heauie tidinges of her fathers death from her. But as nouelties haue wings, and flie with the light breath of euerie tatling tongue: ſo this lamentable ſtorie came vnto the eares of Vallia, who for her recreation and pleaſure, walking in a Parke adioyning to the Pallace, was encountred by a ſimple Souldiour, who hauing loſt his limmes in ſeruice, awayted to impart his ſuite vnto the Emperour for reliefe.
               With this Souldiour, the Ladie queſtioning what ſeruices hée had ſéene, as one that had knowledge of many honourable ſeruices done, but eſpecially glad to heare of her Lord and huſband, whoſe demaunds the Souldiour anſwered with much courage, not letting for his owne good to vtter all: in which his ſpéech, declaring the woorthie conqueſt of Philip
                  
her father (where he was,) a ſuddaine feare ſo poſſeſt him, that his tongue with griefe denied further ſpeech: which of the Lady béeing perceiued, mooued with pittie of his ſorrow, enquired diligently what mooued him on ſuch a ſuddaine to ſtay his talke, beginning now the moſt delight, willing him to ſay on whatſoeuer he had: for ſure ſhe was, that nought but honourable ſhould be ſaid of her father, or her loue, who was with him in all thoſe ſeruices.
               This blunt companion recomforted by her honourable counſell, and good encouragement, ſéeing hee muſt vtter his hearts greefe, albeit hee had no thought or knowledge to whom he ſpake it, after ſome ſmall pauſe, he ſaid. Pardon me, gracious Ladie, for my heauie tidings, and account me no daſtard for daring to ſpeake, what is my hearts griefe, to vtter the ſubiect of my tragicall ſwonding ſorrow, to all the hearers. For the loſſe of our noble generall, whoſe vntimely death hath cauſed ſuch heauineſſe and hearts diſcontent amongſt all thoſe of his gouernment, that will neuer bee blotted from theyr mindes, ſo long as any one breatheth that did know him. The ſorrowfull Ladie hearing theſe dolefull tidings of her fathers loſſe, could not anſwere his talke, nor had power to ſpeake, but as one readie to leaue this life, preſently fell in a traunce to the grounde, whome her gréeued attendants Alynda, and the reſt, by their carefull induſtrie reuiued againe, though with much extremitie. The poore ſouldiour which ſaw howe ill his talke was taken, brooked no longer ſtay in that place, doubting his Princes diſpleaſure, but got him from the Cittie with all ſpéed.
               
                  Vallia her ſuddaine gréefe vrged her paines, that her Midwiues were ſent for, and with great perill of life, was not long after, deliuered of two goodly Sonnes, whoſe ſight, and other comfortable perſwaſions of the Emperour, and thoſe Ladies that were about her, remooued a little her heauineſſe, which ſhée moſt honourablie endured to all theyr ioyes, for this good fortune of the Ladie, ſolemne Proceſſions were made, Belles were rung, and Bonefices were

plentifull throughout the Citie, with all other ſhewes and ſignes of gladneſſe that might be deuiſed. But to whom ſo euer theſe two newe borne Gentlemen was moſt welcome, there coulde none take more pleaſure in beholding them, then the Emperour, who woulde neuer haue anie time from his affayres of ſtate, but the Nurces were ſure of his companie, to their ioy, and pleaſures. In this ofſpring I leaue them, to recount the accidenis happening in Genoway.

they ſhould intitle another in her right. Therefore my Lordes and louing friendes, (quoth the Gouernour) ſhewe in mainteining the honour and right of this Ladie, your loue to her father, in which you gaine more loue and honour, then to be inueſted with title of great worth. For no greater blemiſh can be to the Noble, then to bee tearmed a cowarde, eſpeciallie in a cauſe of ſuch honour as this. Therefore, if you will ioyne with mée in full conſent, eſtéeme his threates not woorth a pinne, and prouide to giue him ſuch a welcome, as is fitte for an enemie.
               The Nobles and all eſtates there aſſembled, hearing the honourable reſolution of the Gouernour, with generall conſent lawding his magnanimitie, committed themſelues vnto him, promiſing on their honours, to maintaine with their bodies, goods, liues, and landes, whatſoeuer he reſolued on.
               This willingneſſe with generall conſent when the Gouernor had ſeene and heard firſt giuing them all hearty thanks for their honourable loue to their Princeſſe, and carefull regard of their common wealth, which they were all bounde by oath to the Church, as well as the figniorie to maintaine. After ſome other ſpéech, he cauſed the Millaine herauld to be brought before them, to whom he ſaith: Herauld, thy meſſage from thy Lord ſo peremptorily ſent, and by thée deliuered, with graue aduiſe of the whole ſtate of our Prouince, we haue aduiſedly conſidered. And finding by lawe, or natures right, hee hath no right nor iuſt intereſt in the ſame, wee haue determined to denie his demaunde, and with our déereſt bloud will maintaine the lawfull iſſue of our late deceaſſed Duke Philip, whoſe honourable deſerts can not bee ſo ſuddainlie worne out. Thou knoweſt what wee intende, if thy Lord bee friend to vs, and our ſtate, wee will requite his loue with the like againe, if a foe, hee ſhall find that Philippes rightfull inheritour ſhall not bée wronged, ſo long as wee ſhall liue. And ſo finiſhing his ſpéech, the Heraulde thus replied.
               
                  
Nobles of Genoway, whoſe grauitie is ſpoken of in all places, deceyue not your ſelues by preſumption. My Lord is puiſſant and mightie, and not to bee dared by them of farre greater and more force then you: wherefore weighing your owne goodes, and welfare of your Countrey and ſtate, conſider with whome you are to deale, his honour, ſtate, power, and what is to bee requyred in Maieſtie, bethinking what a friend hee is to his friendes, and what a terrour to his enemies. In weighing all which I doubt not, but your grauitie and wiſedome will alter theſe fonde reſolutions, before you prouoke him to furie, leaſt when you woulde ſubmitte your ſelues, hee bee as farre of from hearing you, as you at peremptorie in refuſing him. In your aunſwere, conſider your welfare, or ſubuerſion. Therefore let not ouerboldneſſe leade you to miſchiefe: I ſpeake as I wiſh, that you might preuent your owne miſchiefes.
               The Gouernour hearing the Herauld ſpeake ſo much of ſubmiſſion, as though his Lordes countenaunce might terrifie and affright them, euen as Bugbeares do children, thus ſayde.
               Heraulde, what weeneſt thou wee of the ſtate of Genoway are, that thus thou menaceſt vs with thy maiſters high actions, power, and friends? Is Albert become ſuch a Bugge to feare his bordering neighbours? No, let him dare children and fooles, with his threates. If hee come as a friend, as hee did when our good Philip liued, he ſhall bee welcome: if otherwiſe, it is neither power, friendes, nor his valour wee eſtéeme. Our honour wee will maintaine in deſpite of his Bearde, maugre all the friendes Spaine, or Italie can affoorde him. And ſo thou haſt thy aunſwere: replie no more: for what wee ſay, we will performe on our honours, as thy Lorde ſhall finde, when hee dares make triall.

ſouldiers, and making force, that there enemie might not take them ſléeping, but alwaies in readineſſe, when occaſion ſhoulde ſerue to defende themſelues, and offende the enemie.

               How the Herald returning his anſwer from the Ienowaies, Albert puruaied his armies.
               
                  THe Millaine Duke expecting his Heralds return, with the Genowaies offer of obedience, after long looking, arriued at the Court, to whom the Duke gaue honorable welcomes, enquiring the anſwere to his Ambaſſage. To whom the Herald at large recounted the honourable reſolution of the gouernour, who would not deliuer their tytle of gouernment to any ſtranger whatſoeuer, willing him to reſt content, or abide what chance warre will alot him.
               The Millaine Duke raging with furie, at this vnexpected anſwere: vowed by no ſimple oathes to reuenge him on the gouernour, whom he threatned with great afflictions, if hee preuailed: And haſting to ſée the euent of his determinations, preſently diſpatcheth his Ambaſſage to Florence, the proweſſe of Marcellus and Telone, and other his fréendes, for theyr ayd in this exployt, willing them to be readie by a day prefixed, at ſome port of his, to them beſt beſéeming good, and moſt eaſie for their conuay. With theſe letters, the meſſengers being gon, great was the preparation made in his owne territories, of men, victualls and munition, whereof there wanted none, ſuch as the Countrey yéeldeth. Such was the haſt and care of thoſe vnto whom the charge of thoſe affaires were committed, that in ſhort time, althings were prouidedin ſuch good order as could be beſired, their onely ſtay was, for their expected power,

which accordingly was puruaide, ſome marching by lande, others with theyr prouiſion by Sea, ſo that in ſhort time they are all well met, at Millaine, where they made no long ſtaye, but euery man receiuing his charge.
               The companies appointed for the land, marched forwards in thrée battailes, the foremoſt of which, was led by the Duke of Florence, the vauward by the gouernour of Marcellus, and the Rereward, by the Duke of Millaine, who hadde vnder his conduct, all the horſemen, with the carriage and prouiſion. For the Sea ſeruice, was appointed for to bee Admirall, Alfonce Earle of Pyemont, hauing vnder his charge of Gallyes, Bregandines and Foyſtes, one hundred and fiftie ſayles, warlike and well appoynted, with all néedefull prouiſion, hauing alſo vnder his charge, a number apprdoued and Noble Captaines, trayned to the Sea, all carrying mindes of reſolution to inueſt theyr Noble Fréende the Duke of Millaine, in his challenged Dukedome.
               The Genowayes, whoſe prouident care was to prouide for their Countries ſafetie, was not ydle in all theſe times: but making readye what power they coulde, both of theyrowne, and ſuch other Fréendes as they could procure, relying on the Iuſtice of their cauſe, and nought at all fearing the multitudes of theyr enemies, of whoſe numbers they were all aduertiſed by theyr owne Eſpyalls.
               The carefull regarde of the Gouernour, hadde ſo wrought, that all things were ordered to his content, his Fréendes, the Neapolitan Duke with his powers béeing come, and all others that they expect, theyr Gallies and ſhippes furniſhed, the conduct of each ſeuerall companie was appoynted to men of woorth and honourable reſolution, who encamped themſelues with wonderfull great pollycye without the Cittie, euen in the enemies chéefe paſſage.
               
                  
Their power of ſhippes and gallies likewiſe appoynted at poynt deuice, a Councell was called, and the Admirall ſworne in the open aſſemblie not to yeeld, nor in any ſort to diſcontinue the fight, but taking all aduantage, to doo his beſt for theyr defence, and diſcomfiting of the enemie. This doone, and the ſhippes halled foorth, they harboured euery man being aboord, that they hadde charge of. They chéered theyr companie, exhorting them to valour and courage, not omitting often to recounte the right cauſe of defence, with the enemies entrucion, with all other perſwaſions that might tend to their encouragement, to the great comfort of al the companie, who with one voyce yéelded ſignes of great ioy, vowing euerie one to the other, to liue conquerours, or die tenne thouſande deaths, rather then incurre the odious name of coward.
               Thus chéering themſelues with hope of victorie, with a ringing peale of cannons, that made the ayre rattle, and the earth to ſhake, they ſette ſayle, bidding theyr friendes a ſhort farewell, who attending theyr enemies comming, wée leaue them houering at the ſea for a time, till they méete againe.

               Howe the two armies meeting at ſea, the Millaine Duke with his power was diſcomfited.
               
                  THeſe honourable Armies well appointed, both by lande and Sea, a generall expectation was made on both ſides, for their méeting, wherein each one hoping for victorie, wiſhed for to ſée the euent of theyr fortunes (long looked for commeth at the laſt) and time

hath brought the two fléetes in ſight one of the other, which deſcried, all pollicie was wrought for the aduantage in the fight, wherein thoſe gallants of Genoway ſhewed their beſt ſkill, keeping in deſpight of the Millaine armie, the winde, and in great brauerie halled the enemies with their warlike muſicke, in ſuch ſort, that the ſkyes reſounding the ecchoes of theyr noyſe, which was not vnaunſwered by the Millaine fléete, made as gallant a ſhewe as the other, where ſome time was ſpent in tryumph betwéene them, and the Gallies and ſhippes within ſhot, their proweſſe with great courage was diſcharged, and euerie man with ſuch weapon as he vſed did his beſt.
               Long time and much powder was ſpent on both ſides, with much effuſion of bloud, eyther parte doubtfull of the victorie, which the Generall of the Genowayes perceiuing, halling his Viceadmirall, and the Admirall and Viceadmirall of each Squadrone, with a flagge of parley, they drewe neare vnto him to heare what hee hadde to ſaye, who charged them vppon their allegiance, without anie more forbearing or conſuming of time, to boord withall ſpéede euerie man as hee coulde haue aduantage, and ſo to make quicke and ſhort tryall of their fortunes.
               This counſell of the generall was welc

                  me to euerie man, who were verie gladde and ioyfull of that commaundement, which was that which they expected, for they attended but to ſée him, béeing aduiſed to follow his deceiuers. And thereuppon forcing theyr Gallies by maine ſtrength of Oares aboord, with great courage and vallour they gaue this onſet, in which was many feates of honour and armes atchieued, where many a man of woorth left his life, others loſt theyr limbes, and many ſpoyled and wounded to the death. The Gallies fired, and diuers ſunke, all hazards that daye were with great perrill eſpaped, after many bloudie ſtrokes and much other miſchiefe on both

ſides, the houre of the victorie befell the Genowayes, who tooke their Admirall gallie, flew their chiefetaine, and burned and ſunke many of the reſt, ſuch good ſucceſſe followed their iuſt cauſe, that fewe of their enemies eſcaped without great hurt from the fight.
               The fight ended, night approaching, a retreat by the Admirall was ſounded, which doone, a view was taken of the priſoners, and the gentlemen and commanders of the Millenaries, ſent aboord the generall, for the reſt order was giuen, that they ſhould remaine aboord their ſeuerall gallies, which done, a generall laude was giuen to God for their victorie, and euery one following the courſe of the Admirall, they made their way for Genoway, and in ſhort time with the diligence of the Captiues, and good encouragement of the commanders of each gallie, they had ſight of their port, and not long after recouered the ſame, where their ioies were increaſed by the ſight of their friendes happie returne, as by their ſolemne ſhewes of gladnes was manifeſt, to the great encouragement of al the aduenturers, and increaſing of the priſoners great gréefe, who made ſuch ſure account to tryumph in their ouerthrowes, and like Lords to command ouer them, nowe to be ſubiect to their enemies. Thus their heauie ſighes bewraying their ſorrow, the generall of the fléete moued with pittie of their care, beeing a man very debonaire and kind, with a countenance ful of pittie, his bonnet vayled, came vnto the caualleres, perſwading them to comfort themſelues, and to extend this vnexpected chance as one of fortunes bandies, whoſe inconſtancie was not to bée wondered at, for (quoth he) they that gaine to day, may looſe to morrow, the fortunes of warres are difficil, a cleare conſcience and a iuſt cauſe armeth men with courage, & they that fight in right are often fortunate. Our cauſe God hath righted, whom your duke ſought to wrong: he is the giuer of victory, to whom bee all glorie. Yet gentlemen (quoth he) diſmay not, neyther clogge your hearts with too much care of your bad fortunes, you are fallen into the hands of a kinde and moſt noble enemie, who will well intreate you, and for mine owne part, which am

at the Gouernours commaund, I aſſure you, your ranſomes ſhall be ſo eaſie as you ſhall like well of.
               The Milleneres captiue hearing theyr kinde enemie vſe ſuch wordes of comfort, where hee might menace with death and cruell reuenge, béeing at his mercie, with courteſie returned great thankes for his moſt friendly counſell and good perſwaſions, vowing themſelues his obedient priſoners, neuer to departe, or offer any manner of diſcourteſie in worde or action, vntill they were lawfully licenſed ſo to doo. Which worde the Generall accepting, each man had frée libertie within the Cittie, to goe at his or theyr pleaſures.

                  AS God ſent the ſea power of theſe Princes to trie firſt theyr forces, ſo not long after theyr armies approaching, the Millaine Duke beeing aduertiſed by his eſpialles of their readineſſe, hearing of the ill ſucceſle of his fléete, loath to putte all on hazard without ſome more pauſe and reſting his people which were verie ſore wearied with theyr long and hard trauaile, for which cauſe, as well to conſult with his leaders and copartners, hée cauſed his Tents to bee picht, giuing good directions for ſure watch to bee kept throughout the Campe: which done, and they hauing repoſed themſelues that night, the next day a parley by flagge was ſommoned, wherein euerie man was heard, both for aduiſe in marſhalling the Armie, as for pollicie in ſurpriſing the enemie, where in each mans opinion ſayde, the Duke melancholike for his ill ſucceſſe and loſſe of his fléete was ſo malcontent, that nothing might be ſaid wherein he tooke pleaſure: yet gaue he leaue

to euerie one to ſay his mind, which humours nothing contenting his nobility and ſuch as were drawne thither by his cauſe, loath that his headſtrong humours ſhould diſhonour them, the Ferr

                     ra Duke, as one that might be moſt bold with him, ſayd. Coſin of Millaine, for your ſake wee haue gathered bordering neighbours, maintaining no iuſt cauſe of our owne, but your intended quarrell, wherein if wee reape any diſhonour, wee haue our deſerts, Ledde by your counſell wée haue béene, as ſhéepe to bée ſlaine, and now hauing hadde a little croſſe, diſmay you, that our people ſéeing your diſcomfort, may leaue vs héere in the middeſt of our enemies. It is daſtardlike to feare in ſuch a cauſe, and may bréede all our euerthrow: wherefore reſolue eyther to maintaine your honour, and with reſolution finiſh what you determined before our comming from our owne homes, or on mine honour, I will drawe my forces againe to theyr owne habitation, and leaue you to your beſt fortunes: ſay therefore your intent, for wee may not heere long continue, the enemie béeing ſtrong, and in their owne confines, where wee are ſtrangers, aſſured of no fauour, but what wee can purchaſe with the ſword.
               The Millaine Duke hearing his coſin of Ferrara ſo plaine, thought beſt to make ſhewe of good content, whatſoeuer hee thought, wherefore without longer pauſing, as one that in that extremitie deſired ſome counſell, hee ſayde. Moſt honourable coſin, pardon mee, that haue not ſhewed my ſelfe in this action as I ought, and conſider the cauſe I haue of diſcontent, which hath made mee forgette my honourable good friendes: yet good Coſin, diſhonour me not ſo much to adiudge me of cowardize, for euer my heart hath abhorred that odious fault: but what your pleaſure is to attempt, I will performe, and thereon giuing his worde of honour. The Duke conſented to his will, who gaue in charge the next morning euerie man with his companie to bee marching by the breake of day, that lying neare the anemie, th
                     •
                  y might by theyr ſedaine ſcaties ſee what aduantage

there was to be gotten.
               According to whoſe commaunde euerie thing was effected, and the companyes marched neare to the Cittie, within halfe a league where the Genowayes campe laie, where they ſtrongly en ſcanced themſelues, and hauing taken three or foure dayes reſpit, wherewith theyr companie was well refreſhed, a Herauld was ſent from the Gouernour of Genoway, to knowe the cauſe of their comming in armes, againſt the lawes of Chriſtian Princes, to diſturbe their peace, hauing no iuſt cauſe ſo to doo, commaunding him and his friends, confederates, and followers, either to rayſe theyr campe and be gone, or prouide them to battell, and therein trie the euent of eythers fortunes.
               The Millaine Duke hauing attentiuely hearkened to the Heraulds meſſage, mooued with choller at his brauing ſpéech, without regarde of honour or lawe of armes, hadde like to haue beaten the Herauld, but beeing perſwaded by the Duke of Ferrara from ſo vnhonourable a fact, he ſayth. Herauld, goo tell that vſurping Gouernour of my right, that I am come to chaſtiſe his inſolencie, and learne him to knowe his dutie to his leige Lorde, neyther ſhall any one of his rebellious companions eſcape the furie of my wrath, without they come preſently in ſubmiſſiue manner, and acknowledge their fault and great offence committed againſt mée, which if they refuſe, by that time the ſunne hath wiſe made h
                     •
                  r recourſe about the earth, I will méete him, and thoſe ſléeping curres his companions, in the plaine that lyeth Eaſtward from the cittie, ſo God ſay Amen. Therefore depart, my word ſhall be thy ſafe concuct for this tune.
               The Herauld hauing his anſwere, without long ſtay haſtneth to the campe, where vnto the gouernour and his compeeres in armes, he recounted the Dukes reſolute determination, willing him to prepare againſt the time appoynted

to meete him, wherewith the gouernour and the reſt were all well pleaſed, committing theyr cauſe to God, and relying on theyr iuſt Title. And thus reſoluing to méete him at the time and place appoynied for the ſame, hee preſently gaue order to diſlodge his Campe, to drawe more neare the place by the Duke appoynted, ſending his moſt expert men at armes to viewe the grounde, for theyr beſt aduantage, which with great care was ſo accompliſhed, that the ſunne nor enemie could not greatly annoye them. The Millaine Duke and his accompliſes carefull of what they hadde in hande, ſlept no time, but with great care and regard, procéeded with theyr companies more neare the place appoynted, where all things framed by marſhall diſcipline and good aduiſe of the Captaines, they expect a happie day of tryall.
               Time that finiſheth all things, hath brought the appoynted day, in which the carefull leaders ſo buſilie employed themſelues, that all things were ordered in moſt honourable and decent manner, where no pollicie of eyther part was omitted for the aduantage: which doone, and the battailes readie to ioyne, a Herauld was ſent from the Gouernour of Genoway, willing him before hee committed the iuſtice of his cauſe to the battaile, to call to minde the iuſtice of God, in deliuering his ſea powers into their handes, wiſhing him not ſo much to diſhonour his noble houſe and followers, to hazard all to fortune. If hee woulde accept this proffer, and confeſſe the wrong offered his eſtate and commons, hee would remit the iourney paſt, and giue him frée leaue to paſſe in quiet through his countrey, if not, and hee preuailed, hée ſhould finde in iuſtice what it is to diſturbe the quiet gouernment of ſo peaceable an eſtate.
               This meſſage deliuered, the Duke fretting at the Gouernours kinde and courteous motion, ſware by no ſmall power, to acquite his pride, and learne him to knowe to his great greefe, what it is to mooue his

Prince to furie, and ſo with a ſh

               Scantly had the the Herau'd recouered the Pauillion of his Lorde, but a Braueado was made by the Forara Duke, who was the firſt that began the ſight, and was gallantly encountred with the Duke of Naples, who met him hand to hand, each knowing other by theyr colours. Betwéene thoſe Princes began a fierce and deadlie fight, who ſingling themſelues, both hoping of honour, ſo applyed theyr forces one againſt the other, that it was doubtfull whether ſhould haue the glorie of the day. Both of them by their proweſſe giuing courage to their followers, betwéene whome many hardie feates of armes were atchieued, the battell on both ſides béeing very doubtfull. In this conflict, the two Dukes like Lyons, beare themſelues, vntill the Ferara Duke, with long continuance of the fight, fell from his horſe, who was preſently reſcued by a Band of his owne companie, that in the parting, had like to haue ſlaine the Duke of Naples, if the Duke his enemie had not béene more honourablye minded, that reſcued from daunger by his fréendes, hée left the fielde that time. Night growing on them, a retreat was ſounded on eyther part, and euery man withdrew them to theyr Tents: in which battell, was taken many Priſoners, on eyther part, which by compremiſe of the Gouernors of both paprts, was redeliuered. Thus for a time wée leaue them to their repoſe, and hopes of theyr good ſucceſſe, to tell you of the Princeſſe Vallia.

               How the two childrē of the lady Vallia was ſolemnly chriſtned, with other aduentures.
               
                  THe moſt renowmed and noble minded Emperor, deuiſing to honour the Chriſtning of the two children, had inuited all the nobilitie and Princes néere bordering on his confines, to be witneſſes of that ſolemnitie, appointing for that time, great tryumphes to be performed: and for that purpoſe, cauſed challenges to be ſet vp, againſt all commers, to be maintained by his champions, the winners to haue rich rewards.
               The day of ſolemnitie béeing come, many Princes and Noble perſonages aſſembled themſelues to the Tryumph, the Emperor in perſon, being Godfather to both the ſonnes of the Knight of the holy Croſſe: vnto whome, many rich preſents were giuen, by ſundry Princes, that honoured and loued theyr Father.
               At theſe bankets, amōg many others which harkned of forrain nouelties, Alinda, buſying her ſelf to heare, & ouerheare ſtrāge tidings, heard two noble gentlemē diſcourſe of the ſtate of Genowaye, recounting at large, the honorable demeanor of ye Gouernor thereof, & his ſucceſſe, in their ſea aduentures, with each particular chance, happening in theſe warres, which waited of Alynda, that néeded no oratour to tell her tale, her tongue carrying a heauie waight, vntill ſhée had opportunitie to reueale the ſame vnto her Ladie: which ſhée ſought, yet could not obtaine it, vntill late in the euening, when euerye Gueſt had withdrawne themſelues to reſt: when hauing time fit to her deſire, ſhée beganne firſt in pleaſant motions to féele the humour of her Ladye, whether pleaſantly

or melancholie diſpoſed, and finding her pleaſant humour, ſhée ſaide. Madame, ſince the heauie tydings from Genoway, I haue not ſéene one pleaſant motion poſſeſſe you, lette mée your olde ſeruant, intreat this fauour at your hands, to ſaye, what you coulde well frame your féeble and vnable handes to doo, in defence of your owne rightfull inheritance of Genoway?
               
               
                  Alinda (quoth the Princes) thy fond prattle will neuer bée left, what mooueth theſe ſuddaine motions, and recounting Genoway, ſay, what occaſions are offered in thoſe parts, I pray thée ſay?
               Madame (quoth Alinda) your Ladiſhip alwaies is pleaſed to miſtake me, and my ſimple meaning, what I intende héerein, is nothing, you knowe I am none of thoſe that ſéeke common: wealthes benifit, but ſay good Madam, that I were, as I am neuer like to bée, the rightfull heyre to the Dukedome of Millaine, and ſhould by violence ſéeke to vſurpe your right in your Dukedome by force, what dueſt you doo for defence of your ſelfe and your people? Alinda (quoth the Princeſſe) ſéeing thou ſayeſt thy talke begunne is in ieaſt, I will as héedleſly anſwere thy demands.
               Suppoſe Alinda to be my enemie, and in Armes in my Countrey, ſpoyling my commons, and ruinating my Countrey, thou mighteſt well accuſe mee of cowardiſe, if in Armes I ſhould not méete thée, reuenging my iuſt cauſe on my enemie: for thus, and in this manner, would I chaſtice the Millaine Duke: laying good ſtroakes on the backe of her mayden, with a cudgell, which ſhée eaſily found. Which chaftiſment that ſhe could well demeane her ſelf, turned in this maner. Madam, if to be Duke of Millaine, be ſo painefull, and that to a vſurper, there belong ſuch puniſhment, lette them bee Dukes that liſt, Alinda will be her ſelf as long as ſhe can. Thē good Duke of Millaine aunſwered the Princeſſe, I am verye ſorye that I ſhoulde ſo ſuddainlye vntytle your grace: but vppon ſome conditions, I will make your Maieſtie recompence.
               
                  
Madame quoth Alynda, promotion I féele is heauie, the name of Duke is imprinted I feare me in blacke and blew on my ſhoulders. But ſince they be badges of your Ladiſhips colours, and your gift, in hope of better I muſt accept theſe. But may it pleaſe you to let me know your conditions, that liking thereof, I may deſerue your reward. I marie Alinda (quoth the Princeſſe, but firſt ſweare vnto me to anſwer iuſtly my demands, and then aſke thy reward.
               
                  Alynda hearing the Princeſſe ſo pleaſant, was loath to hinder her begnune myrth: but féeding her vaine, of put her from thoſe dampes, ſaid.
               Madame, ſince it is your Ladiſhips pleaſure to bring mée from a zealous propheſier, vſing no oath, but yea, yea, and nay nay, cock and pye, & ſuch like, to rend thoſe creatures that God hath made, ſay by what you will haue me ſweare, and I will parforme it.
               How now Alinda (quoth the Princeſſe) where blowes the winde now? the Moone I dare gage my life is in ſome merrie corner, that hath brought thée to this conceited pleaſures: but leauing all, tell me as thou tendereſt my loue: What mooued thée to name the Duke of Millaine? my minde preſageth ſome vnexpected chance hath happened: my people by his meanes if they haue, and thou therewith acquainted, I ſweare by that loue I beare my Lord Edward, neuer to forgiue it thée, vnleſſe thou reueale thy meaning therein, and tel me the truth of what thou haſt heard.
               The maiden hearing her ieſt prooue ſo contrarie, loath to offend her, which ſhe honoured aboue all the creatures on the earth, thus ſaid. Madame, I haue often heard it amongſt the learned, obſerued for a principle, not to ieaſt with ſuperiours, dreading the miſtaking of any ſimple meaning, whereof I might haue taken héede, but ſéeing my tongue hath béene ſo long hanged to vtter the hearts ſecrets, pardon what I haue to ſay, and I will hide nothing to ſatiſfie your deſire. Then procéede (quoth the Princeſſe) and whatſoeuer thou ſayeſt, I fréely forgiue it thée.
               
                  
                  Alynda, whom all intreaties might not pardon from telling her minde, ſaide: This day my gracious Ladie, the banquet béeing now furniſhed, with many an honourable Gueſt, two gallaunt youthes whoſe names I knowe not, queſtioning one with the other, of the ſtate of Genowaye, and of the Prouince thereof, comming lately from thoſe confines, a tale of ioye, and much lamentations hee deliuered, which wroong manye teares from my heart, at hearing thereof, it cauſed manye excéeding ioyes to poſſeſſe mée. Yet diſpoſed to croſſe me (quoth the Princeſſe) leaue off I ſaye theſe fond deluſions, and ſaye how both ioye and care at one entir time aſſayled thée.
               Madame (quoth Alynda) when he deliuered the pride and incolencye of the Millaine Duke, ſeeking firſt by intreatie to obtaine your right in the Dukedome, by winning the regent to his will, whoſe truſt when he could not abuſe, he raiſed a mightie power by ſea, and another huge hoaſt by 
                     〈◊〉
                  , ioyning with other Princes néere adioyning, to accompliſh his will. The

                  auy diſcomfited by your Captaines, and they obtaining a moſt honourable victorie, the Duke himſelfe forageth your confines, and hath fought a moſt honourable battell, each ſide dooing theyr deuoyre, in ſuch wiſe, as it was doubtfull whether hadde the beſt, and thus they left them: and this hath bredde both my care and great ioye.
               The Princes who tendered her natiue Countrey as her owne life, premeditating on her maidens ſpéech, and recounting each ſeuerall accident, many times wiſhed her Lord preſent to chaſtice thoſe vſurpers: vowing to reuēge thoſe wrongs on Millaine, and all partakers: yet this in her womaniſh furie, reaſonable meanes ſhée had none to make, without acquainting the Emperour therewith, which ſhée was verye loath to doo: Yet beating her Braines, to finde outſome ſhift, to behold the manner of their dooings, ſhée was euer croſſed by ſome other contrarie accident, which made her ſollitarie to abandon the companie of all people, onely her truſtie ſeruant

excepted, who ſéeing her heauineſſe, lamented her raſhneſſe in reuealing thoſe tydings, which yet renewed her ſorrowes.
            
            
               CHAP. XXV.
               Howe the henourable Princeſſe Vallia, performing her Church duties, after her trauaile, went diſguiſed from Rome.
               
                  THe Princeſſe which ſought many means to attaine her deſire, longing more déepely to ſée the eſtate of her commons, then for any worldly benifite, and to yéelde them comfort in theyr diſtreſſe. The time of her Churching béeing nowe finiſhed, ſhée bethought her ſelfe of one ſecret intent, which ſhée would aſſuredly put in proofe, if Alynda woulde thereunto giue her conſent, deniſing many waies how to acquaint the maiden with her purpoſe, yet fearing to diſcouer the ſimple intent of her former purpoſe, who knowing her Alynda to bee of a moſt ſharpe and readye witte, ſhee firſt by manye circumſtances bounde her to her ſecrets, which doone ſhée ſaid.
               
                  Alynda, in many extreames, thou haſt béene my faithfull councellour, and conſelor of my ſecretes, from whome the déepeſt thoughts of my heart hath neuer béene hidde, and hauing founde thyloyaitie, I doubt not the like at this time, which I will requite to thy content: to holde thée longer from what thou expecteſt to knowe, I haue ſince I hearde thée diſcourſe the diſtreſſe of my poore ſubiects, vowed to GOD my Redéemer to ſée them, and to lend them all ſuch

helpe as my power will ſtretch vnto, onely for furthering my intent héerein, aduiſe mee what ſecret courſe to take, in which thou ſhalt highlye pleaſure mée: But as thou loueſt mee, ſtande not vppon any denialls, or perſwaſions to withdrawe mée from this determination, for whatſoeuer betide of mee, I will execute what I haue héere intended.
               
                  Alynda which ſawe her earneſtneſſe to performe her will héerein: be ſought her of pardone, her wittes béeing to ſimple, to giue readie aduiſe in a caſe ſo full of daunger. But Madame (quoth ſhée) that you ſhall knowe, my loue is as firme as euer it was, deuiſe you the mean, and I wil doo my beſt to enact it, kéeping your ſecrets if I dye for it.
               Enough, my owne ſwéete Alinda, I take thy woorde, and on thy faith, charge thée preſently to prouide mee ſome truſtie fréende to accompanye mee, which an diſguiſed in mans attyre, armed like a Knight of the Emperours, will trauaile, my companion knowing nothing what I am: Wherefore ſaye to him, whome thou ſhalt appoint for my guide, I am thy Brother, that for ſome occaſions of thy Ladies, is bounde for thoſe parts of Italye, and on thy woorde, aſſure him of a good rewarde for his payne, to his verye good lyking. But haſte thee, for I can enioye no quiet content, vntill I haue honourblye performed my will.
               Madame (quoth Alynda) this ſhift may goe as currant as heeretofore. But ſay good Madame, how ſhall I aunſwere your abſence when the Emperor ſhal enquire for you? Marrie this my Alynda, thou ſhalt giue it out amongſt the Ladies of the Court, as well as amongſt mine owne attendaunts, that I haue made a ſolemne vow, to faſt certaine dayes: In which time, performing my other penance for my ſinnes paſt, I will not bee ſeene or ſpoken vnto of any but your ſelfe: this ſhift, I doubt not, but maye ſuffiſe.
               
                  
Excellent my good Ladie, (quoth Alynda,) I ſée now a willing horſe néedes no ſpurre, God ſende your Ladiſhippe well to proſper in your iourney: for I neuer ſaw your wits ſo ſharpned before.
               But now for horſes, where will you ſpeede? Thy ſelfe, Alinda ſhall bée my credit, thy honeſt word ſhall bée enraged to the maiſter of the Emperours Horſe, for two ſuch as ſhall bée moſt excellent, if not, mine owne aſſurance ſhall ſerue with him, to doo thy owne adopted Brother anye pleaſure.
               Beléeue mée Madame, I like your plat well, and doubt not, but that ſhal be as wel performed it. I haue bethought mée of a propper Gentleman, a wooer of mine owne, in ſooth hée is: whome I will coniure, of that loue hée hath ſo often profeſt, to beare my Brother companie, and to prouide him ſome good guide for his conduct: in meane time, I will prouid
                     •
                   your furniture, which ſhall all bee bought to your owne perſon.
               What ſayeſt then Alinda? wilt thou name mée in buying for mée thoſe needefull things? No Madame (qooth ſhée) you miſtake me, 
                     〈◊〉
                   that to my charge, and cumber you no more with theſe cares.
               The plat béeing laide for the Princes iourney, Alynda ſo applieth her ſelfe in puruaying each néedefull thing, that manye dayes were not ſpent, before each neceſſarie was brought into the Princes lodging, and exquiſitly fitted her, guide and other conſorts, to her owne verye good lyking. Which béeing 
                     •
                  oone, and the doye appoieted for theyr departure, Alynda calling her Fréende before the Princeſſe, ſaid.
               Moſt gracious Ladie, lette your humble ſcruant intreat your Ladiſhip to grace this fréende a kinſman of mine, with your fauourable countenance. And ſéeing I haue made choiſe of him amongſt all the gallants of this royall Court, I beſéech you witneſſe with mée, what truſt I repoſe in him, that commitmine owne and onely brother to his guiding, in a

iourney for my good, which hee vnde

                  eth. Yong hee is, and not able to endure ſuch harde trauaile, without ſome good guide: and ſickneſſe, incident to all men, may oppreſſe him: of which (my good Hortelious, for ſo was he named) take thou eſpeciall regard, for that what thou doeſt to him, is done to my ſelfe, and as great ſhall thy thankes be in doing him pleaſure. To morrow by that time the morning ſhall giue light at the gate, behinde theſe lodgings he ſhall attend you, where faile not to méete him, and me: and ſo for this time farewell.
               This kinde louer which had no thought what ſeruice he vndertooke, was carefull of his charge, loath to be accouncounted negligent at this firſt entertainment, ſlept not vntill he had all things in good ſort readie. The Princeſſe minding her iourney, was all night, or the better part, in arming and prouiding her ſelfe, attending the comming of her truſtie guard, who failed not his houre appoynted, where the Princeſſe accompanied with her Alynda, met him. And making ſmall ſtay, taking their loath depart each of other, wee leaue them to their iourney, and Alynda to her ſtudious thoughts, how to beguile the Emperour, in her Ladies abſence, as hereafter you ſhall heare.
            
            
               CHAP. XXXI.
               Howe the Emperour with great regarde of the infants good fortunes, cauſed a man of Arte to calculate their natiuities.
               
                  THe Emperour whoſe 
                     •
                  elicitie was in thoſe noble children, of whome hee had more care th
                     •
                  n of an ordinarie friend, deſirous to knowe what in their birthes was predeſtinate vnto them, ſought manie wayes to attaine vnto his deſire, and acquainted ſundrie his friendes with his intent. Atter long care taking to attaine his deſire, had intelligence of a reuerent Hermet,

which had his being on Alpes leading from Rome to Naples, whoſe Art was matchleſſe in the Arte Methimaticke. Vnto this hermet he ſent his truſtie councellor Anthonie Buſcatho, entreating him, (whom he might commaunde) to ſatiſfie his pleaſure herein ſending, by him, the houre, day, and moneth, truly ſet downe of their natiuities.
               Such haſte made this noble man, that hee came vnto the Cell of the Hermet, whom hee kindly intreated to ſatiſfie the Emperours pleaſure herein, who loath to be drawne from his heauenly motions, could not a long time be perſwaded to it. In the ende, ſo manie were the intreaties, and importunate ſuites of the noble Meſſenger, that he graunted his good will, promiſing by a certaine time to fulfill the Emperours ſuite, and by writing to ſatiſfie him.
               
                  Anthonie hauing what he deſired, returned the Emperor his anſwere, who ſpending the time in manie thoughts of his deſires, tooke no reſt vntill he heard what the Hermet ſaid. As time ſpendeth, ſo time brought the limitted time to ende, of which the Emperour was carefull, when calling his Anthonie, he cauſed him to ſpéede vnto the Hermet, where making no ſtay, poſted about his buſineſſe, and in happie time arriued at his Cell: where entring conference with the aged father, touching his queſtions, he receyued no wordes at all, whereon he might take any occaſion of iudgement. But after ſome r
                     •
                  
                  paſt taken, he ſayd.
               Friendly Anthonie, whoſe paines hath béene ſuch, to ſée my homely Cell, thankes for your paines, to my gracious Prince heartily commend me, and vnto him deliuer theſe fewe lines, which ſhall import that ſmall knowledge I can giue.
               The noble man hauing receiued his meſſage, woulde not make more inquirie of ought, but taking his friendly farewell, haſteneth vnto the Court, of whoſe comming the Emperour was glad: who calling him into his Cloſet, enquired the newes he had. At which drawing his packet, ſigned with the Hermets ſignet, he deliued the ſame vnto his Maieſtie, who renting the ſeales, read the contents thereof following.
               
                  
                  The Nobles borne within the ſtately Court,
                  Mongſt Princes great, ſhall beare a kingly port.
                  The latter borne, a ſtraunger hence ſhall ſteale,
                  By whom great good ſhall chance thy cōmon weale.
                  In armes with many matchleſſe Princes he ſhal fight,
                  Yet neuer be foylde by anie humane wight.
                  Gods glorious name by power he ſhall aduaunce,
                  And ſhall be knowne at length by happie chaunce.
                  Who gaue him life, of him ſhall life receiue,
                  Where he tooke life, there ſhall he life bereaue.
                  In trauaile ſhall this worthie champion bide,
                  Vntill this luckleſſe fortune to him ſhall betide.
                  Marrie he ſhall, with a moſt princelie wife,
                  And end his daies in religiou

                  The Elder brother like a Lion fierce,

                  The flying birds his parents ſhall bewray,
                  And raging beaſt, ſhall vnto him obay.

               Theſe darke and cloſe couched lines, when the Emperour had read, and ouer-read many times, and could not conceiue the meaning therof, he was more troubled in ſpirit then before. But when hee was warned, that the yonger ſhould be borne from him by a ſtranger, he tooke order that their nurces ſhould bee in one of the chiefeſt fortreſſes about the Cittie, where hee vſually viſited them: in whome hee tooke more delight, then in anie thing, eſpeciallie in Conſtantine the yoonger, which bare his name, of whome his feare was moſt. The elder whom had to name Nartelions, hee was not ſo watchfull of, yet had he a fatherly care of both. In this great regard, and héedful care, theſe princes were ſeuen yeres within the fortreſſe

of the Cittie nouriſhed. What after happened them, the Hiſtorie ſhall ſhew you as it commeth.

               Howe the Princeſſe Vallia arriued at Genoway, and what happened her.
               
                  LOng and wearie trauaile hath brought the Ladie in ſight of Genoway. Before ſhe could recouer the Cittie, ſhe was encountred by the Ambuſcadoes of the Millaine Duke, who tooke her priſoner, and brought her to the Dukes Pauillion. The Duke ſéeing ſo fayre and beautifull a face, queſtioned him (for ſo we muſt teame her nowe) of whence hee was, and what affayres ledde him thither, whether hée came as a friend or an enemie. Vallia, whoſe ſe

Noble Prince, the deſire I haue to make triall of my manhood, hath brought me to thée, for that I haue heard thy honours ſpoken of amongſt many. A Gentleman I am, deſirous to ſée the manner of warre: and if thou vouchſafe it, the price of my ſeruice ſhall be imployed for thee.
               The Duke which noted her beautifull face, her kinde ſpéech, and affable countenance, held her for nloeſſe then ſhee ſéemed. And without vſing any circumſtances, gaue her entertainmēt: appointing her a place néere his owne perſon: which kindneſſe ſhe verie gratefull accepted, returning many thankes for his honourable acceptance.
               Not long had our yong warriour remained in the campe, whom in her attire we name Philipo, but a ſcallie was made by the Citizens, whoſe vittailes waring ſcant, woulde gladlie ſéeke all poſſible meanes to be quit of their enemies.
               
                  
The larum in the campe giuen, all armed and in aray, Philipo was not laſt, but mounted, in very comely and braue maner demeaned hir ſelfe, ventering ſo farre in purſute of the enemie to the gates, that ſhée was with her guide taken priſoner, which the Millaine Duke ſeeing, commending the forwardneſſe of his new entertained ſouldiour, ſought to reſcue hir. But his ayde came too late. No ſooner was the Ladie within the Citie, but carrying the ſhew of a Cauelere, ſhe had good entertainement, and well intreated. That night the Gouernour with his commaunders being pleaſantly delighted at ſupper, and euerie man recounting what ſeruice they had ſéene and done that day, the captaine whoſe priſoner ſhe was, acquainted the Gouernour what a prize he had that day gotten, leauing nothing vnremembered that might honour her, whome he made reckoning would purchaſe him ſtore of crownes.
               The Gouernour on this report of the Captaine, was verie deſirous to ſée this priſoner, yet for that night made little reckoning of it, in the morning early, his mind deuiſing of his nights reſolution, accompanied with his beſt friendes, tooke his occaſion to walke by the houſe of ſigniour Vincencio, where ſhee remained, with whom he queſtioned of ſundrie occaſions. After ſome friuilous ſpéech, he enquired for the priſoner, who was preſently brought before him, whome he ſaluted verie kindly, requiring him to ſay of what countrey he was, and what name and parentage. Sir quoth Philipo, for ſo lette her be remembred, what you are I know not, neither deſire I to know, but haue heard that lawes of armes allow not euerie man to examine, eſpecially a gentleman. Therefore pardon me, for without the gouernour or his ſpeciall authoritie, I will not acquaint any with my eſtate, and ſo good ſir quoth ſhe reſt ſatiſfied. Syr quoth the gouernour, your peremptorie ſpéech ſheweth ſome great mind, which I pray God proue ſo happie for your hoſtes ſake. If then I can entreate the gouernour to come or ſend for you, wil you vouchſafe to acquaint him with what I haue required? True ſir (quoth Philipo) you conſtrue my minde right, for which I am beholding vnto you. You are verie pleaſant gentle,

man (quoth the Gouernor) which I wiſh to continue, & would gladly craue this fauour, that I might on mine owne authoritie demaund whether you know the gouernour, which you would ſée. Sir anſwered Philipo, the honourable gentleman yet I neuer ſaw, but in regard of his vertues and honourable commendations, I both loue and honour him.
               Thankes (quoth the Gouernour) for your good opinion and report of him which you hold an enemy, but happily may proue otherwiſe, for which, if any haue any thing to ſay, either in ſecret or otherwiſe, ſpeake as a friend, I am the man, vnworthie though I be of ſo honourable a place, wherefore if thou haue ought to ſpeake, ſay boldly thy minde, for by the honour of that ſeate which I do now poſſeſſe, I will fréely heare thée, and pardon whatſoeuer.
               
                  Philipo which ſaw how harſhly ſhe had demeaned her ſelfe, with a bluſhing countenance which might wel haue bewrayed what ſhe was, humbly beſought him of pardon for her vnwilling offence proteſting by the honour of a ſouldiour, ſhe had no knowledge of him, which the honourable gouernour beléeuing and forgiuing, ſhe ſayde. Noble minded Gouernour, hearing of the wrongs offered you and your people, I craued pardon and leaue of my ſoueraigne the Emperour, to be partaker of your ſeruice, as well to right your iniurie offered you, as for the loue and dutie I owe this countrey where I had my béeing firſt, and iourneying hither, intending what I ſay, was ſodainly ſurpriſed by the Ambaſſadours of the Millaine Duke, who taking me at aduantage, there was ſmall reſiſtance, but yéelding me their priſoner, had entertainement of the Duke, who vſed mee moſt kindly, yet not content with his fauour, béeing enemie fo your ſtate, and heire of my late deceaſed Lorde Duke Phillip, in the laſt ſeruice I willingly aduenſured my ſelfe in that manner to come vnto you, and in ſigne of my loyaltie and faith, though I be young and a ſtraunger, whoſe credite yet is not requiſite you ſhould truſt too farre in a time ſo daungerous, yet as I am a Gentleman (which title with my life I will for euer maintaine) bee ruled by mée,

and doubt not the ſuddaine remoouing of your vſurping enemie.
               The Gouernour liſtning to her long diſcourſe, noted her modeſt countenance and courage in deliuering the ſame, yet holding it wiſedome to haue better knowledge of any man, whom he ſhould truſt in a cauſe of ſuch importance, thanked him for his proffer, crauing reſpit for his reſolution therein. And ſo after ſome other courteous ſpéeches, giuing his word to his hoſt for his libertie, hee inuited him to his lodging, where hee was feaſted with great welcome, the gouernour delighting much in his companie and pleaſaunt parley, which in their ſecret diſcourſes, was for matters of ſtate, touching the weale of her people, though the gouernours leaſt ſuſpect was of her, whoſe right hee gouerned. To her delight, being now in place of her moſt chéefeſt delight, we leaue her a time.

               How Alinda taking care to keepe ſecret her Ladies abſence, demeaned her ſelfe.
               
                  
                     ALynda the truſt of her Ladie, and the faithfull ſecret kéeper of her miſtreſſe, after ſhee hadde carefully prouided all things, and ſéene her horſed to her iourney, beganne nowe to deuiſe in what a laborinth of daunger ſhee had wrapt her her ſelfe, if ought ſhould betide her Lady, but well to auoyde her owne danger, and to frée her Ladie of ſuſpect, her ſubtile pate was not free from carefull ſtudie, which way ſhee might beſt keepe her ſecrets cloſe, imagining ſometime one way, ſometine another: at length a more better preſents it ſelfe to her memorie.

But ſtanding in an extafie, holding it wiſedome not to be prouided if occaſion ſhould ſerue, ſhe gaue it out, that her Ladie vowing a long faſt and ſecret, would not be ſéene or ſpoken to of her Alynda.
               
               This plotte working effectually, Alinda orderly as ſhe was accuſtomed, went to viſite the children, from whence ſhe returning, ſhe puruaid with her owne hand her diet, as for her Ladies ſeruice, and then attyring her ſelfe in her Ladies attyre, would ſhew her ſelfe. In this manner continued ſhee without ſuſpect of her Ladies abſence, vntill the Emperour pittying the Lady, doubting leaſt her long ſolitarineſſe ſhould moue her to melancholy, and thereby ſome dangerous ſickneſſe might enſue, wh

                  n hee hadde often ſolicited her by her ſernant Alinda for the ſame, and receiued ſuch anſweres by her as hée liked not, mooued with a kinde deſire to ſée her, hée vowed that if

                  he left not her chamber by a time limitted, paſſing the bondes of honour, he would violently breake the doores vppon her.
               This wind of furie made Alyndaes heart cold, fearing her Miſtreſſes honour ſhould not by abſence bee queſtioned of, and her ſelfe without confeſſion of her beeing where ſhee might not bee knowne, in daunger of the Emperours diſpleaſure, and loſſe of credite and life: to anoyde all which, many wayes ſhee deuiſed, yet none ſafe inough, as ſhee thought: but as women haue alwayes ſome ſhift, if it were to deceiue the Diuell, ſo Alynda deuiſed this meane, vnto her Ladyes confeſſour. In a morning earlye ſhee went, where after her, many pretie queſtions and aunſweres paſſed betweene them, Alynda to trye the conſtancie of this holy father, charged him on his holy orders, and by the reuerent zeale hee bore to religion, to ſay what hee would doo for her Ladie, in maintaining her honour and reputation.
               The Frier who thought on no ſuch matter as the ſubtile Alinda, willing to make a ſhewe of zeale and dutie, proteſted by all holy vowes, that whatſoeuer reſted within his

power, he would gladly effect for her Ladiſhip, if the loſſe

And ſo decking herſelfe in the attyre of a man, onelie accompanied with a Gentleman of the Court, who knowing her but for my brother, are gone for Genoway, ſince whoſe departure, my care béeing great to kéepe her credite, haue giuen it out, as well to the Emperour, as to all other, that my Ladie hath made a holy vowe, and obſerueth a faſt for certaine wéekes, in which time ſhee will haue no conference, or be ſéene of anie, but my ſelfe. But the Emperour dreading thorowe her ſolitarineſſe, ſome melancholike infirmitie, ſhoulde enſue, hath ſworne, if ſhee come not abroade in a certaine time, to drawe her perforce into his companie.
               To ſalue all which, let me intreat you, by ſhat promiſe you haue made, to morrow morning by that houre the Emperour doth vſually walke about his priuie garden, to come vnto the Court, where I wil attend you, and be your guide to her chamber, where my ſelfe diſguiſed in my Ladies apparell, will with you feigning great conference, ſhewe vs at the windowe

                  Alynda ſeeing her worke haue effect to her wiſh, returned him many thankes for his courteſies, promiſing large rewardes for his friendſhip: which done, committing him to his deuout ſeruices, ſhée ſpéedeth to her lodging, about her ordinarie affaires.

                  he chéefeſt of his men at Armes, and nobilitie, hee diſcourſed vnto him much matter to theyr lyking: touching the miſerie of the towne, aſſuring them on his life, before manye daies were ended, the cōmons in deſpite of the Gouernor wold yéelde themſelues, if in time he and his accomplices ſought not his highneſſe fauour. With theſe pleaſing ſpeeches, & often carrowſing betwéene thē, at finiſhing of each ſtorie, the night was well ſpent, Philippo for his welcome, was lodged on a Pallet

in the Dukes Tent: which done, and euery man at his quiet, the Court of guarde about the Tent, being halfe a ſléepe, as one that reguarded his honour with the gouernor, ſéeing all ſound, ſerched the Dukes pocket, where finding the ſignet, he iſſued out the Tent, commaunding the Captaine of his guard to ſend him the word, for that diſguiſed, hee would walke that night about the Campe.
               The Captaines ſéeing the Dukes ſignet, gaue him the word, which obtained, about his other buſineſſe he goeth, effecting all things as he wiſhed. The Duke being faſt, thruſting out his torche at the Tent dore, as though the Duke intended to viſit the Ferrara Duke, which lay not farre off, he fained ſpéeche with the guarde, vntill he thought the Gouernors eſpyalls had ſéene the ſigne: When making no longer ſtay, with a Holbart on his neck, taking his way towards the Citie, he paſt with the word without any moleſting. The Gouernor which had hope in his champion, ſlept not his time, but with his horſe, and many other a foote, attended the comming of Philippo, to direct them, which made all poſſible haſte, and in good time to all their comforts, met the Gouernour: Vnto whom he briefly deliuered what was done, beſéeching him to let his footemen paſſe, by ſmall companies, to a place by him aſſigned, whither he would conduct them, and at the allarome giuen, to make haſt with his horſemen to their reſchew. The Gouernour hauing good hope of ſucceſſe, commending his pollicie and reſolution, appointed his men by him to be led, ſtraightly charging them to be gouerned by him, who giuing them the worde, marched on to a ſide of a ſmall hill, cloſe on the backe ſide: the Dukes tent where they ſtayed, vntill theyr guide Philippo had appointed them what to doo.
               
                  Philippo, applying his buſineſſes, bringing the companye cloſe to the Tent, hauing the Duke faſt bound, wrapped him in his night gowne, accompanied with two or thrée good followes more of his crewe, with theyr weapons drawne, drewe him from his naked bed: with which awaking, and perceiuing them ſtraungers which were about him, he would haue cryed

out for helpe, which Philippo perceiuing, thruſt his gloues into his mouth, ſwearing by all holineſſe, that if hée ſpake anye worde, he ſhould preſently haue his paſport, to hell, which was the habitation of ſuch vſurpers: Therefore willed him, as hée tendered his life, to bee ſilent, and his bodye ſhould haue no harme, which to doo, hée was enforced: Taking what they woulde with patience, hauing him within theyr power, they cutte the coardes of the Tent, and pulled him out vnderneath, beſtowing him at theyr owne pleaſures: that done, leauing him in ſafe kéeping, they gaue the allarome, killing and ſlaying without mercie. To whoſe ayde, came the watchfull Gouernour, who with his power, did ſuch feates of Armes, that the whole Armie was diſcomfited, ſome fledde, but moſt 
                     •
                  laine. The Dukes with the principall were taken Priſoners, with many others, which were deliuered preſently. But the Duke with his complices, hée ſent vnto the Cittie, to take better aſſurance of his loyaltie.
               Thus the pollitie of Philippo preuayling, and thoſe Lordes of theyr riches and prouiſion, which they hoped to haue made theyr Captiues, the Gouernour ſent vnto the Towne, the happie ſucceſſe of theyr ſeruices, marching himſelfe by eaſie paces, dooing Philippo all the honour hée coulde. Who being mounted on a beautifull Ienet of Spaine, led the two Dukes his priſoners.
               The happie tydings of this honourable victorye ſuddainlye ſpread throughout the Cittie: great was the tryumphing they made, where no ſolemnitie was left there vneffected for honour of the ſame, euery one lauding the pollicie of Philippo, and dooing him all the honour that might bee deuiſed.
               To the excéeding gréefe and heartes diſcontent of the Dukes, who blaming theyr light credence of a ſtraunger, whome they neuer ſawe before in their liues, woulde on his wordes, vttered of purpoſe to ſerue his owne turne, admitte him to ſuch fauour and truſt: but after warnings comes too late. They are nowe to bee vſed at the

pleaſure of the Gouernour, vnto whom Philippo became an earneſt ſutor, for theyr courteous entertainement, and honorable vſage.
               The Gouernour, whoſe honour was increaſed by the induſtry of Philippo, imbraſing him in his Armes, committed the whole eſtate of thoſe Princes and Nobles, vnto his direction: by whom he ſolemnely vowed to be gouerned, for which, as one that could demeane himſelfe to all eſtates like himſelfe, hée returned many heartie thankes, and accepted his kind proffer.

                  h her Alinda, whome ſhée greatly feared might encurre ſome daunger, by her long abſence: to auoide which, ſhee beſought the gouernour of lyſence to departe: pretending buſineſſes of great importaunce. To whoſe ſute, although willingly he would haue condiſcended, yet with earneſt intreati

                   and loue hee bare him, he beſought him to ſtaye with him, promiſing on the fayth and honour of a Gentleman, as himſelfe, hee ſhoulde participate in all liuing Land and goods, which hee had, or ſhould euer haue. For which Philippo rendered many heartie thankes, but might not bee intreated: for which the gouernor, as well as many other his followers, and fréendes, were heartily ſorie, ſurceaſing theyr booteleſſe ſutes, leaſt theyr importunitie might bréed offence, yet they beſought him, to accept the raunſome of the priſoners which were to bée diſpoſed by him.
               When Philippo ſaw the honorable minds of thoſe his friends,

which hee had good cauſe to loue, for maintaining his right, and euerie way diſcharging the honourable parte of a truſtie ſubiect, loath that ſo great fauours ſhould go vnrecompenced, hee firſt on their alleagance to the rightfull heire of the Dukddome, charged them ſtreightly to fulfill what he ſhould giue in charge, being no diſparagement to their honours and eſtate, to which they willingly agréed, confirming by oath what he had ſet downe, and then ſaide. In performance of the words you haue giuen, this ſhall you do, before thée moneth is fully expired, you ſhall in perſon repaire vnto Rome, where before the imperiall maieſtie of my ſoueraigne Lord the Emperour, you ſhall preſent theſe Dukes your priſoners, where I will recount your honourable deſerts, and deſerued commendations, that your Princeſſe Vallia may reward your honourable ſeruice. Till when, honourable Gouernour, weare this ring, by which you ſhall finde me, if you forget the name of Philippo. Which ſaid, and the ring deliuered, the gouernour wondering at the grauitie and noble minde of the reſolute gentleman, ouercome with his noble proffer, could not fell what way to recompence the leaſt of his deſerts, but rendering him many thankes, beſought him in the moſt humble manner, to acknowledge their duties to their ſoueraigne Ladie Vallia, whoſe ſeruadts thee vowed them in all loyaltie. Theſe conditions agréed vppon, and euerie thing with conſent finiſhed, the time appointed for Philippos departure, a band of ſouldiours were appointed for his conuay to Rome, the captaine of which companie, hauing great charge for his honourable vſage, vnto whom ten thouſand crownes was deliuered at their leaue taking of him. The time of his departure being come, Philippo taking a ſolemne farewell of the Dukes of Millaine and Ferrara, with the other noble priſoners, the gouernour with the moſt nobleſt of the countrey, conducted him on his iourney, of whom when they took their leaues, many teares were ſhed: ſuch was the ſorrow for his departure. whome they had no knowledge of. Whom after many loth farewels, wee leaue to his iourney, accompanied with his guard and the gouernours, to manie

               How Philippo arriued in Rome, and what chanced Alinda.
               
                  THe Gouernour hauing loſt our noble Philippo, there néeded none to haſten hun, whoſe thoughts was of his Alinda, whom he had engaged for his returne. As time worketh many effects, ſo long trauell hath brought this noble ladie within one dayes iourney of the Citie, her long deſired place of reſt, when calling the captain and his companions, hee diſcharged them from their further trauaile, largely rewarding them for their paines: where the Captaine was loath to leaue her, before hée had ſéene her in ſafetie in the Cittie: but when no perſwaſions might ſerue but they muſt needes leaue her, the Captaine making readie the gold, preſented it vnto her, deſiring her to accept it as the gift of his louing friends of Genoway.
               
               
                  Philippo wondering at the bountie of the Gouernour, gaue them many thankes, but no entreatie might cauſe him to touch one penny, the Captaine on his part loth to offende the, Gouernour againe to returne it, proteſted by his honour in armes, and faith of a ſouldiour, to leaue it to his diſpoſition. Which oathes Philippo was not willing he ſhould violate, but meaſuring his honourable minde, receiued the Golde, the one halfe of which, he fréely imparted amongſt the Souldiours, who accepted it without deniall, with many thankes, the other halfe betwéene the Captaine and his guide he equally ſhared, vnto whom yeelding many thankes

for his bountie, taking their leaues, they left him on his way for Rome, and they returned for Genoway.
               
               The time of her expected returne was now neare expired, wherein Alynda was to prooue her wittes yet againe as ſhée had doone: whoſe cunning by the good helpe of the Frier, tooke ſuch effect, that the Emperour by his godly counſell was reclaimed from his intended purpoſe, although the Princeſſes abſence wrought his great diſquiet, yet patienting himſelfe, hée was content with hearing of her good health, for which hee diligently enquired euerie day of Alynda, whome to quiet from further care or diſcontent, Vallia arriued at Rome, and taking her lodging in an Oſ

                  ria, ſent her guyde to the court in ſecret, to giue notiſe to Alynda of her returne, willing her in the euening to méete her at the place where they laſt parted.
               This tydings to Alynda was welcome, who was not a little comforted with that newes of her Ladyes good ſucceſſe, for which giuing GOD thankes for his fauour, and kéeping and preſeruing her in her iourney, ſhée awaighted with diligence the good howre of her Ladyes home returne, where giuing her attendance, ſhée hadde not long ſtayed before ſhee hadde ſight of her, the moſt welcome of the worlde. What ioy at theyr méeting there was, with theyr ſundrie diſcourſes, I omitte, vntill in quiet content ſhee was placed in her lodging, from whence after ſhee hadde diſcharged her guide, ſhee was not long abſent, where beeing with her ſecret Alynda all alone, ſhee queſtioned her of all the chaunces that hadde happened ſince her departure from thence. Which aunſwered, Alynda forgatte not to tell her the perplexed eſtate wherein ſhes was at the Emperours woordes, menacing her to ſée her Ladye, no occaſions whatſoeuer ſo preuent him: with the pollicie ſhee vſed, and ayde of her confeſſour. At which diſcourſe the Princeſſe might not forbeare heartily to laugh. What other prattle happened, magine you Gentlemen, that

               CHAP. XXVII.
               Howe Edward accompanied with the Gouernour of the Rodes, and his Ladie hauing performed their ryttes in the holy land, returned home, and what chanced.
               
                  YOu haue heard gentiles of the recouerie of the gouernour of the Rodes, by the noble knight of the Croſſe, who gathering ſtrength and ſome eaſe of his wounds, by the knight his good recure, arriued at ye holy Citie, where they made their ſtay, doing ſuch religious ceremonies, as to vowed trauailers appertaineth: where their welcome was great for the knights loue, whoſe honour they wiſhed for the ſeruice done, in defence of the holy Citie. After the gouernour was well recouered, and all things to their content finiſhed, the knight deſirous to ſée his Ladie whom hee neuer heard off ſince their parting, cauſing their cōpanie to be ready to depart, and their attendants to puruay them of victuals, for prouiſion paſſing the mountaines: which done, taking theyr leaue of the high prieſts, and the chéefe of all the citie, who conducted them on theyr way, they trauailed without any aduenture, vntill they came to the Cittie of Aleppo, where they ſtayed to refreſh themſelues. In this Citie, there was reſident certaine Spaniſh marchants, who enuying the good countenaunce of the knight, and the loue was made him by the viceroy there, moued with reuenge of his counte generall, ſlaine by the Knight of the Croſſe, after their returne from the wars, ſéeking many wayes to intrappe him, and finding no cauſe or meane to accuſe him of any ill, whereby to procure his trouble, hee conſorted with his Ianeſaries, who were appointed

to wait on him by ſome pollicie to do him to death, promiſing great rewardes for his paines. Thy fact being committed, theſe hell-hounds whom no conſcience mooued to remorſe, in hope of gaine, vndertooke the action. And vnder ſhewe of kindneſſe and zeale to him that was a knight at Armes, intruded themſelues into his companie, admitting him to many bankets, the better to worke their willes on him, ſéeking opportunitie to ſlay him, taking their occaſion to quarrell for pledging a carrous: which the Knight refuſing, a ſturre began betwéene them, where he receiued many iniuries, and ſome woundes, before hee offered any offence: when the multitude growing about him, and he vnarmed, winding his Mantle about his arme, he reft from one of the Turks his ſemitarie, with which he made ſuch way, that they helde themſelues moſt happieſt, that were fartheſt off.
               The rumour of which broyle, was noyſed thorow the Citie, that thither they came from al parts, to take parts, and to be beholders of the fight. In which, after many déepe wounds giuen, and many of the vngouerned Ianeſaries ſent to hell, when he could make no more reſiſtance, compelled by the heat of the place, and wearineſſe of the fight, he yéelded himſelfe vnto the handes of the Iwae, chiefe Iudge of the Citie, who promiſed him to bee his warrant from all men, that no daunger ſhould betide him: on which promiſe he deliuerd his weapon. The Spaniſh Marchant, whom they called Guido, ſtanding on his houſe top to beholde this tumult, hoped well that the Knight had bin ſlaine, but it proued contrarie, at which he ſtormed greatly, but more gréeued to pay his promiſed ſummes, which for his life hee durſt not denie, fearing the Ianeſaries ſhould haue ſlaine himſelfe. Which ſeconde gréefe, cauſed the traiterous Spaniard to ſéeke his further trouble, vrging theſe Ieneſaries, to lay vnto the Knights charge, matters of treaſon in the ſtate of the Cittie, thereby to cut him off by lawe, which hee, nor the beſt Cauileres of his Countrey, durſt out looke in the face, in anie ſort to attempt ought againſt him of force.
               
                  
Theſe Ianeſaries ſuborned by large gifts, wrought others to take part with them, who were néere the Viceroy, and the Gawr, which vppon their reports ſummoned the Knight to their iudgement hall, from the priſon where hee lay chayned, vnto whome matter of great vntruth was obiected, concerning the ſtate, which hee ſtoutlie denied. But thoſe Curres, which had ſolde his life for money, ſtorming that hee had fauour to ſpeake, offered to ſweare by theyr holie Alcaron, that he with the reſt of his confederates, viewing the Citie in theyr ſecrete walkes, had taken notice of theyr forces, inquyring by circumſtaunces, of ſuch as they accompanied wich, what numbers of men they had, and howe with vittailes they were relieued. Theſe accuſations ſo vehemently vttered agaynſt him, the Viceroy coulde not but examine: and finding him guiltie of the ſame by theyr falſe iudgement, ſentence of death ſhoulde with all ſeueritie paſſe agaynſt him.
               The Knight ſéeing his cauſe daungerous, putting his hope on him that neuer left him comfortleſſe, with a bolde vndaunted ſpirite, and as one that feared not their threates, knowing death was the woorſt, thus ſayd. Reuerend fathers, Iudges of mens cauſes, you haue here by your lawes condemned an innocent man to death, for no cauſe iuſtly offered, but falſely and vntrulie by enuie, and of your owne imaginations, wrought agaynſt me. Firſt, by force they pretending loue vnto mee, in that place where they gaue mée vittailes, they ſought to take my life from mee. Their intended purpoſes that way failing, ſtanding on mine one ſafetie and defence, they haue here falſely accuſed mee of matter neuer thought on by me. But ſay (patrones of iuſtice and honour) that I ſhould haue viewed your forces, what may one naked man do, where are thouſands of braue and gallant ſouldiours? If your wiſedome would but in iuſtice ſift the cauſe, you ſhould then find the wrong offered mee, that am here a ſtraunger amongeſt you: from whom I appeale to the Grand Seigniorie for iuſtice, or being a ſouldiour and a man at Armes, in your

Citie, which are moſt men at Armes, let mée in combat trie mine innocencie. If to neither of theſe my lawfull ſuites you do agrée, the worlde which heares of your vniuſt dealing with mee, will ſcorne your lawes, and to your greate reproofe, to report your wrongs done a gentleman and a ſouldier.
               The King which was a Runnagatho, an Eaſterling borne, and was not to learne the Chriſtian lawes, and good nuriture, hearing his reſonable requeſt, ſaide hee ſpake reaſon, and called before his accuſers, vnto whom he ſaid. Countrimen and fellowes, you haue here on your wordes, brought a Chriſtian and ſouldier to iudgement, whom our lawes hath condemned by your reports, whether of truth, or in reuenge of ſome of thoſe who loſt their liues in the broile begun by you aamongſt your ſelues, we cannot ſay: but as I am appointed your gouernour, and expreſly charged by his Emperiall maieſtie, whoſe authoritie I beare, to vſe iuſtice to all men without fauor: in which, I hope I haue hitherto borne an equall hande, neither ſparing my f
                     •
                  iends, nor fauoring my enemies: ſo in this caſe, you muſt vſe what law of Armes requireth. Therfore this is my ſentence, which if you be ſouldiers, and your cauſe iuſt, you may not denie, that you two his accuſers, ſhall in ſingle combat (according to the lawes of our land) maintain your accuſation by fight: for which, appoint your ſelues agaynſt to morrow, or reuoke your words before the whole aſſemblie.
               The Ianeſaries, who leaſt looked for this fauor to be ſhewed a Chriſtian, mooued ſome other of their friends to vrge againſt him the ſlaughter of thoſe ſouldiers by him murthered, & iuſtice to procéed for breaking the peace in their citie, being the principall fort of the land, againſt the law of Armes: which the knight thus anſwered. Your grace hath heard ye malice of thoſe people, whoſe intent, if they may haue their wils, is my life, of which if your grace conſider, that what I did was in mine own defence and ſafetie of my life, hauing receiued ſundry woundes, which are yet to be ſeene, before I offred any one a blow: if a worme hauing no fence, will turne being troden on, worthy of blame may not that man be, which will defende his life, who once loſt can neuer be rec

                  lled.
               
                  
The king interrupting his ſpéech, turning him to the accuſers, ſaid: You are to maintaine your euidence, attend your limited time, or confeſſe your accuſation falſe: which ſaide, hee committed the gard of the priſoner vnto a Captaine, to ſée him forth comming at the time appointed.
            
            
               CHAP. XXXII.
               How the Ianeſaries loath to maintaine the fight, laboured the Spaniard to buy his libertie.
               
                  THe faint-hearted Villaines, who had ſéene the feates of Armes done by the Knight, doubting their force, which was farre vnable to encounter a man of ſuch woorth and experience in Armes, fearing by theyr foyle euer to bee diſhonoured, perſwaded the Spaniſh Guido, in friendſhip to make offer of loue vnto the Knight, who béeing a Chriſtian, for a ſumme of money might deliuer him, threatning him, if hée wrought not ſome meanes for to free them from the combatte, they would diſcouer his pretended euill, and cauſe him for his treaſon looſe his heade. The Spaniard vexed at the heart, to ſée his buſineſſe take no better effect, perſwaded himſelfe of two euils to chooſe the leaſt: without any more pauſe taking, accompanied with others of his confederates in the action, ſléeping no time, came to the Knight of the holy Croſſe, whom with great ſhow of kindneſſe, and many curteſies he ſaluted, feining great ſorow for the wrong offered, perſwading him to patience, for that there was no right to bee expected, from them, who ſold their lawes, liues, and whatſoeuer for money. And (quoth the traiterous Spaniard) where ſuch gouernment is, accurſed is the land, but more accurſed the people: wherefore (quoth he) if you will be ruled by me, that am a Chriſtian, and bound in conſcience to relieue euery man profeſſing God, much more a man of ſuch eſtéeme as your ſelf, which with your life hath maintained

his honour in many places, doing good to all people in diſtreſſe. Stand not on any thought of your being, or what you haue bin, but conſidering where you are, rather yéeld your ſelf vnto their fauour for money: without further triall or danger, I will vndertake to buy your libertie. Thē (noble Engliſh man) prefer not mony before your life: for being here, if you preuaile againſt your accuſers, yet ſhall you euer go in danger of ſecret enemies which will not bee ſatiſfied before they haue your life. I ſpeake as a friend, whoſe welfare I eſtéeme. Therefore with wiſdome cenſure of your good, by being counſelled, or your peril by being too headſtrong: if you accept of my profer, I will take order for your libertie, without any charge of yours: which don, you ſhal preſently be tranſported to Valencia, a famous citie of Spaine, my ſhip being readie fraughted for that place, attending but a fayre wind. Whē the knight which during his long preambulation, had conſidered o
                     •
                   his ſpeech, he was perſwaded yt he ſpake but truth, yet could not iudge his ſecret intent, which made him that hee thought not of any euill to bee pretended by him that profeſſed conſcience and chriſtianitie, making this account, that he were better howſoeuer, to be with Chriſtians, then in the hands of ſuch reprobates, being but a money matter, which by his friends, whereſoeuer he became, might ſhortly be prouided. Wherfore, with many kind courteſies returning hartie thanks to his traiterous friend, he ſayd. Kind friend, whoſe friendſhip offered I knowe not howe to merit, albéeit my conſcience perſwadeth me I ſhall proſper well in the combatte, aſſuring my ſelfe on God, who protecteth his people, yet in regarde of theſe my followers heere preſent, as for my libertie, I accept your offer, which I will requite, cauſing the mightieſt Prince of Chriſtendome to rewarde thee with thankes, and my ſelfe with large ſummes, to ſatiſfie thy debt: wherefore if you intende what you ſay, ſpéede about it, that I may know to what euent our friendſhip will ſort.
               The Spaniard glad to heare his purpoſed determination grow to ſo good a paſſe, imbracing him, like a ſeconde Iudas, whom he ſought to betray, beſought him, not to diſmay in any

thing, for all the goodes he had were at his diſpoſing. And ſo for that time taking his ſolemne farewell, he left the Knight to manie conceited thoughts of his newe profeſſed friend, himſelfe ſpéeding to finde the traiterous Ianeſaries, who were as faine of his good ſucceſſe in his buſineſſe, longing to heare what would become of it, whether the Knight cetermined to trie the cauſe by fight, or otherwiſe by friendſhip ende it, as the next Chapter ſhall ſhew you.

                  ner, expecting death, then this good conſent of Edward to Guido, who trauailing in care as the painefull woman labouring with childe byrth, was in a moment freed from that painfull extacie where with ioy neare ouercome, his tongue bewraying his hearts content, making ſmall ſtay, but Iudas like (as a Spaniard practiſing treaſon) taking his farewell, hee looketh not behinde him, vntill hee came to the lodging of the Ianeſaries, vnto whome he came not before he was long looked for: who reſting in a quandarie, was as fearefull to trie their accuſation by fight, as the Spaniard to abide the hazarde thereof, who noting Guidoes guilfull countenance, their guiltie mindes gan preſage ſome good euent Beeing mette, as you heare, imagine Gentiles, whether there were anie queſtions left vndemaunded of the Spaniard, touching his late accompliſhed buſineſſe, which might tend to their welfare, or that the knight intended ought which might bréede their diſcredite. Of all which, when the Spaniard had at large reſolued

them, recounting from poynt to poynt each ſeuerall accident chauncing betwéene the knight and him, with what curtefie he offered peace and friendſhip vnto him, whoſe death he moſt deſired, cloking his villainie with ſuch ſhewes of loue and friendſhip of Chriſtianitie, they all laughing for great ioy at the Knights ſimplicitie, and the traitours knauerie, ſpent the time froliking together, vntill the next morning, where in their quaffing & drunken diſcourſes, a matter of more perill for the Knight was plotted betwéene them: whoſe heart being frée from all guile, had not the leaſt ſuſpect of what was intended agaynſt him, as you ſhall heare hereafter, where the Hiſtorie recounteth it, and returne nowe to the Ianeſaries: who drunke with delight of their glad tydings, wiſhed long for the ſight of that ioyfull day to ende all their doubts, which no ſooner appeared, but the Ianeſaries loath to be preuented in what they intended, ſpéedeth them firſt vnto their commander the Gaw, and vnto him deliuered the Spaniards ſuite, and the Baſhaw which was for the deliuerance of the Knight for raunſome, beguiling the ſimplicitie of the Gaw, with the earneſt ſuit of the Spaniard for him. And offering their good conſents, ſo that therewith contented, omitting nothing which might giue liking, or gaine the good will of thoſe they ſought, to theyr wiſh. All which reportes of them made, was ſo ſoothed by Gindo, that the Gaw, mooued partly with pitie of the knight, and more with gaine of the Crownes offered for his fréedome and libertie, calling for his companie, ſpeedeth vnto the Baſhaw, whome he found preparing himſelfe with all his brauerie to beholde the euent of thoſe Combatters, who ſeeing the ſpéedie comming of the Gaw, thought verily that they had béene alreadie attending for his preſence, and beganne earneſtlie to enquire the cauſe of his ſuddaine comming ſo earlie.
               The Gaw which was wiſe and experienced, as be fitted his authority, be ſought the Baſhaw to withdraw him frō the companie when he would deliuer what he had to ſay. Whi
                     •
                  h done, and they all alone, Gaw deliuered each particular which the

Iaueſaries and Spaniards had mooued him with all, with his opinion in the ſame, al tending to that thoſe traitours deſired: and the knights libertie, of all which when they had aduiſedly conſidered, although they could well haue giuen their conſent to haue ended all matters, yet for faſhion ſake, they called the reſt of their councell, who hearing the matter, ſtood not long on tearmes, but called for the Spaniard, demanding whether the motion wer made by the knight, or of any other of good wil towards him: which Guydo affirmed to come from the knight, and beſought him of fauour therein, vndertaking to pay the raunſome, whatſoeuer they would inflict vpon him.
               At hearing of the Spaniards large proffer, ſilence was againe proclaimed, and the Spaniard diſmiſſed, betwéene them agréeing on the ſumme, and dayes of payment which they rated him: but howſoeuer the Spaniard muſt not forſake his word, leaſt hee pay the price of the raunſome with his head.
               This done, and the articles by them ſetdowne, which the Spaniard muſt confirme, hee was againe called, vnto whom the Baſhaw ſayde. Signior Guydo, thoſe goods parts and diſcréete carriage of your ſelfe euer ſince your comming amongſt vs, we haue diligently noted, as your ſelfe in all your buſineſſe haue founde more then all other ſtrangers, and as tofore, ſo nowe in this motion you haue made for the reléeſe of this Chriſtian, whome although our lawes haue condemned for a fact not to bee tollerated in anie, yet at thy earneſt requeſt, and motion of thoſe his aduerſaries, it is concluded, that for his libertie you pay tenne thouſand crownes, the one halfe inſtantly, and the other at your next returne of ſhipping from your countrey: which doone, and hee deliuered, you ſhall awarrant his departure with his companions: the firſt fayre winde to carrie your ſhipping hence, or otherwiſe on his longer ſtay to be again apprehended, and iudged as before, to endure the penaltie of death, as alreadie without further triall. To theſe conditions if thou agrée, prepare thy money, and 
                     ••
                  ay the Combat, which muſt otherwiſe preſently procéede.

The Spaniard which had all that hée exſpected, hauing his life and poſſeſſion of him whom he hated decay, humbly thanking the Baſhaw for their fauour, thought the priſe was high which he was for his pretended treaſons was inioyned to paye, ſetting a counterfeit ioy on his gréeued heart, he departed to his lodging, where, by his owne ſtore, and his Countrey mens ayde, he furniſhed the ſame: which he preſently paide, and had the Priſoner deliuered, whom he moſt kindly intreated, feaſting and ioying with him, ſo long as he remained with him, how vile ſoeuer he intended hee ſhoulde bee vſed at his departure. In which time, came the ſhip, as I haue alreadie tolde you, ſtayed of purpoſe for his deliuerance, to carrie him from thence. Whereof, how glad ſoeuer the Knight and his company was to bee freed from the daungers of thoſe helhoundes, yet was his exchaunge little amended, as you ſhall héereafter knowe further. Onelye nowe héere reſteth to ſhewe you his embarquing from thence, what ſucceſſe his hadde, and of his Trayterous vſage at Sea, by Guydoes commaund, you muſt a while pardon, to heare of the Arriuall of the Gouernour of Genowaye, with the reſt of his Nobilitie at Rome.

               How the Gouernor of Genoway holding his word with the counterfeit Knight arriued in Rome, and of theyr entertainment.
               
                  IT is here remembred, that Vallia in her Knights attyre, after ſhe had by her pollicy and valour freed her commons and countrey from the tyrannie of the Dukes of Florence, as you haue heard, inioyned by ſolemne oath, the Gouernor and the pheres of the Countrey, to appeare before the Emperour, who in the behalfe of the Princeſſe Vallia ſhould requite their faithfull truſt.
               The Gouernour regarding his honour, but more his oath, when he had ſetled all things in good ſort, he paide his owne Souldiours, and richly rewarded his forraine fréendes, with the ſpoyle of his enemies, to euery mans good content, hauing puruaied a rich and moſt ſumptuous trayne to accompanie him: taking good order for the ſtate and welfare of his commons, attended with the chéefeſt Lords and gentles of the countrey, he left the Cittie and by eaſie iournies, paſſed on the way to Rome beguiling the wearineſſe of theyr iourney with ſundry paſtimes and ſports, vntill they came by long and diligent trauaile to drawe towards the Cittie, when by theyr meſſengers, they aduertiſed the Emperour of theyr comming: vnto whome they all were moſt heartilye welcome, as was manifeſt by the fauourable and kinde entertainment of theyr tydings bringer: Whome the Emperour moſt honourablye feaſted, dooing him all the honour that coulde bee deuiſed. With this newes, the Emperour could not bee quiet vntill

hee hadde aduertiſed the Princeſſe Vallia with the ſame: Who knowing better then the Emperour, the onely cauſe of theyr comming, ſetled a ſhewe of much gladneſſe at the hearing thereof: then queſtioning the occaſions that brought them thither, wherewith the Emperour was nothing acquainted.
               The Emperour when he had emparted his newes to the Princeſſe, ſummoning his ſtate, and principall of his moſt honourable counſell, gaue ſtraight charge, for the royall entertainment of thoſe ſtates, in the moſt honourable and beſt ſort that might bée deuiſed: taking the like order, that all things with ſuch company as hee appointed ſhould bee ready. The next morning by riſing of the Sunne, they were horſed to méete thoſe noble ſtraungers on the way, which accordinglye was done in the moſt gallaunteſt order that euer coulde be deuiſed.
               This done, ſending theyr curreres before to giue notice of theyr neare approching, they left the Cittie, ryding neere, vntill the ſonne had brought the mid day to an ende. At which time, the firſt intelligencer gaue worde, they had diſcryed them within tenne miles: and ſo as on their iourney they drewe neere, they were euer aduertiſed, as time bringeth the matters of moſt moment to ende, ſo theſe ſtates had ende of theyr deſires, time and trauails bringeth both companies, in viewe one of the other, to their great delights: at which enter-viewe a pleaſure it was to beholde the youthfull troupe of nobles and gentles, how gallantly they demeane themſelues, dooing many braue and commendable feates on their horſes, on both ſides deſeruing ſuch praiſe as was admirable. In this ſort dooing theyr kinde courteſies they paſſe by eyther companye, vntill the gouernour méete the Emperour: When proſtrating himſelfe on his knee, hee drewe neere the Emperour offering to kiſſe his ſtyrrope: which in no wiſe the moſt courteous Emperour woulde ſuffer, but taking him with great loue and honour from the grounde, bid him oftentimes

heartilie welcome to theſe confines, which ſhewes of loue, the Gouernour and his people very well accepted, in ſuch manner, as the ioy thereof enforced them to ſhedde many teares.
               This done, and euery Nobleman and Gentleman haue don the like, enquiring the principall of the Gouernours trayne they equally matched themſelues, and paſſed on theyr way, diſcourſing very louingly of many pleaſant matters, vntill they came to a Caſtle of the Emperours, called Forte Vencencio: Where that night they were moſt royally feaſted, with all delicacye. The next daye, after theyr repaſt taken for theyr breakfaſt, they left that place, procéeding on to the ende of their wearie iourney, ryding ſo long, and with ſuch pleaſure, that they had ſight of that Cittie. The ſ
                     •
                  ituation whereof, they admyred to behold, with the beautie of Churches, and ſtate of the houſes, of honour: but that which moſt pleaſed theyr delights, was to beholde the moſt beautifull Riuer Tybres from whoſe flowing ſtreames, ſo many pleaſant Creekes were filled, and whereon floated ſo many huge ſhips, of eneſtimable woorth, and whereon ſhewed the Emperours fléete of Gallyes, who ſéeming to bée enuironed with the aſſayling enimies, moſt pleaſantly, and full of warlike pollicies, laye battering one the other, with their ordinaunces, and as the aduantage was offered, here they entred, and tooke, them others they fired: and the Conquerours tryumphing, brought the others awaye Captiue, after the manner of the Sea.
               No ſooner hadde this pleaſaunt fight left theyr labour, wherein euerie one tooke great pleaſure, paſſing on thereof diſcourſing, euery man ſpeaking his opinion of the honourable fight, and commending the manner of the ſame, and good performance of the leaders, when ſuddainlye Ambuſhed on a greenes ſide, where they were aſſayled by a companie of ſouldiors, which came to giue them welcome in like ſort: from this Ambuſcado, diſcharged they their ordinance, and after iſſued, brauelie aſſailing the horſemen, who ſodainly

were encountred by another companie, which in like manner firſt played on them with their field ordinance, and after ſpent ſome time in ſhewing their agilitie and nimbleneſſe in diſcharging their ſhots, doing many notable and commendable feates of armes, to the great ioy and chéering of their wearied ſpirits. That paſtime in liſte manner ended, the ſoylers caſting themſelues by their captaines cōmandement into warlike rings, marching cloſe to the ſtirrup of the Emperour, and the Gouernour, diſcharging their péeces in their march with great cunning, they bidde the ſtrangers all heartily welcome, who with great content and courteſie, returned them all moſt heartie thanks.
               This ſhewe with excellent commendations of all beholders performed, the ſouldiors marching with their colours diſplaid, conducted the Emperor and his troupe to the citie, where with other ſolemne ſhewes they were by the ſenate and ſtates, as well abbots as other of authoritie, both ſpirituall and temporal, as for the vulgar fort, whoſe cryes and voyces of ioy might wel perſwade thoſe ſtrangers for whoſe ſake they were aſſembled, to be all welcome to them, as to their ſoueraigne. In this content they arriued at the royall court of the Emperour, where their Princeſſe Vallia accompanied with a traine of beautifull Ladyes, gaue them many heartie welcomes: vnto whom in all humble acknowledging their loues and duties, by their ſhewes of obedience, they were all conducted to their ſeuerall lodgings, royally feaſted by the Emperour and his nobilitie, during their ſtay in the cittie, of which you ſhall heare more as it ſhall be required: leauing them to their paſtimes & ſeuerall diſcourſes of their common weale, and ſtate of their countreyes, with the princes: to tell you further of the knight, and his hard entertainment at the ſea.

               Howe the Maſter of the ſhippe, by the commandement of Guydo their Marchant, chained and impriſoned the knight, and what chanced him.
               
                  ALſo it hath beene in the former hiſtory declared of the knights departure to the ſea, where they had not long béene, and they from the ſhore ſcantly looſing ſight of the ſhippe, but the maſter which had his leſſon before, calling vppe his companie together, willed them to follow him into the cabine, and there to chaine the knight, which hee ſayde hee muſt doo for his and their ſecuritie. The companie, whoſe loue the knights courteſie had de generally gained, hearing this intended euill againſt him, who wiſhed them all well, beganne to perſwade the maſter from this intent, which would not heare them, but proſecuted his will, although to his great coſt, as it after happened, for the maiſter whome no perſwaſions might enduce from his rigour, hauing the chaine in his hand, entred the cabine, with him other officers of the ſhippe, and without ſaying any word vnto him, violently layde handes vppon him.
               The knight wondering to ſée this vnexpected wrong offered him, who ſuſpected no ſuch matter, and not knowing their pretence, force perforce graſped with the Maiſter, and wringing his chaine out of his hands, gaue him ſo ſore a blow on the head, as his braine was therewith beſprinckled, and hee lay gaping for that which hee neuer more obtained. The boate-ſwayne and ſome others of the cheefe, who who were acquainted with the treaſon, ſeeing theyr Maiſter ſlaine, aſſaulted the knight, entending with great tyranny

to reuenge his death, and to make him faſt as they hadde promiſed: but too eaſie a reckoning made they, for he was more of account then millions of the ſlaues, as with theyr limbes they were compelled to witneſſe, for when the knight who tooke them all for friendes, ſawe their intents of euill, and could imagine no cauſe, defending himſelfe, hee ſo manfully bare him, that to the diuell hee ſent them all to accompanie him.
               When hée had made way in the cabine, and cleared him ſelfe of thoſe that there aſſailed him, taking one of their weapons, hee ruſhed violently out vppon the reſt, who fledde like ſhéepe from a dogge: ſuch was the power of an Engliſhman in multitudes of Spaniards.
               By this time the Page and the knight of the Roades who by trecherie was clapped vppe in a cabine, hadde made way for themſelues, and with ſuch weapons as they coulde gette, was come vnto him, who noting the timorouſneſſe of the baſe villaines, ſayde. Vnfaithfull Spaniards, more bruit then beaſts, more cruell to Chriſtianitie then the enemies of Chriſt: what wrong haue I offered you, that thus you goo about to bereaue mee of life, whome I loued ſo dearely: But ſéeing you baſe gromes (quoth hee) thus haue without cauſe mooued my patience, I will not leaue one mothers ſonne of you all aliue, to declare your hapleſte tragedyes, vnleſſe you acknowledge your guiltineſſe, and timely recount vnto mee the originall of this miſchiefe, which doo, and ſaue your liues, or otherwiſe prepare your ſelues to follow thoſe traytours that lie before you.
               The poore Marriners which were as ſorie for the wrong which was offered as himſelfe, greeued, humbling themſelues at his feete, beſought him of pardon, and not to impute the blame of theyr Maiſters crime vnto them, for quoth they, wée are his hirelings, vnacquainted with anie intended euill againſt you whom we all honor and was glad of,

if our maſter had any ſuch charge by the Marchants, or otherwiſe had any motion of his owne frée will to offende you, that is altogether vnknowne. To ſhew our innocencie herein, behold his ſonne that lately commanded vs, him before your eies will we with all crueltie intreate, thereby to find the occaſion if we can. And then taking the boy they ſtripped him, and tying him to the breech of a péece, with cords, whipped him, to make him confeſſe what the cauſe was of the wrong offered by his father to the knight. But for any crueltie they could ſhewe, he would not confeſſe neither his fathers intent in the action, or where the Marchants letters were beſtowed, wherewith the knight was ſatiſfied, and commanded them to reſt ſatiſfied: but they which were well vſed to the boyes ſubtiltie, threatned him with death, without hee confeſſed what they had required, which obſtinately he euer refuſed, vntill a bold and mercileſſe villaine, which in deſpight of the boy, more then of truſt to the knight, heating oyle boyloing hot, bedropped his naked ſkinne therewith, which torment the poore boy no longer able to endure, kneeling, cryed out for mercie to the knight, and hée would not onely deliuer the letters, but his armour and weapons, ſo that his life might be ſaued. At which words, ye knight commanded them to ceaſe their crueltie, promiſing on his word of honour, that no man ſhould doo him wrong, but hee would protect him, ſo that he performed what he had promiſed, and thereon ceaſing their puniſhment at the knights commandement, they expected now to be ſatiſfied from him, what ſhould cleare them from all iealous doubts, wherein the knight helde them, for his harſh and bad entertainement, which made them haſten the boy to his buſineſſe, vrging him to that taſke which he was verie loth to be drawne vnto, but perforce compelled vnto it, he cauſed the knight to defende the holde of the ſhip, where incloſed in a huge drifat, he found his armor & all other his abiliments, and furniture for his bodies defence, in which a packet of letters was incloſed, directed to an honourable perſon, neare alyed to the Spaniard ſlaine long before, and maſter to this Guydo, his laſt hatefull enemie. The ſight of al

which ſo mooued the Knight to pleaſure, that forgetting all other occaſions, or minding his Packet, he ioyed onely in poſſeſſing his armes, cauſing the boy to be fréed from his bondes, and with good ſtore of crownes rewarded him.
               Now Gentles is to bee remembred, the carefull loue of the Knights Page, who ſéeing his maiſters ſmall regard of thoſe Letters, cloſely conueyed them into his Pocket, without acquainting any man with them, longing to knowe the contents, yet loath to make theyr ſecretes knowen to anie man.
               In this Laborinth of diſcontent reſted the Page two dayes, and more, being verie deſirous to knowe the effect of thoſe lines. At laſt fit oportunitie béeing offered by one of the companie, who in the watch ſingling the Page, which was euer wakefull for his Knights welfare, he beſought the Page of fauour in commending an earneſt ſuite hee had to his maiſter, which himſelfe durſt not vtter. To which the Page willingly agréed, on ſuch conditions as hée bound him vnto. One of the Articles of which was, that hée ſhould faythfullie reade, and interprete vnto him truely, either in Italian or French, which the boy beſt vnderſtoode, the true effect of thoſe Letters: And hauing read them faithfullie, with great ſecrecie to conceale them without reuealing the leaſt worde, ſillable, or letter therein contained.
               This done, and his ſolemne oath for performaunce made by all holy rites that Spaniards vſe to ſweare, hée brake the ſeales, and read the contents of the chiefeſt, touching our matter, and the knights occaſion of further trouble.

abroad, and the night calme and fayre, left his loathſome Cabin to take the ayre, and comming vnawares by the Page, heard the concluſion of his long perambulation: with which he deſired to be acquainted. But the Page on the ſuddaine being taken, though he would, could not colour with any ſhew thoſe Practiſes. But drawing thoſe letters, whoſe contents he ſo lately had knowledge off, beſought his Lord with very earneſt ſute to peruſe them, and as he found, ſo to take héede how he or any Engliſhman hereafter, truſt any trayterous Spaniard. The Knight muſing what mooued the Page to theſe humours, retyred againe to his Cabine, calling for a light: read their contents, which moued his patience, and cloyed him with melancholie, to which we leaue him.

               How the Gouernour and Nobles of Genoway, in tryumph before the Emperour had knowledge of their Champion Don Philippo, and what chanced.
               
                  IT hath béen recounted, of the honourable enterfainment of the gouernour and his company, with the honours done them by the Emperor, who in fauour of the Princeſſe Alinda, graced them with all the kindneſſe and honor that might extend to ſtrangers and the ſubiects of his beloued friend: Theſe noble ſtrangers renowmed in the Court, paſſing the time with all honourable paſtimes, night and day, which could be deuiſed. Many waies by their own fauourers and followers, they diligently enquired of their champion Philippo, as well to thanke him for his ſeruice, imployed for their good, and fréeing them from their enemies, as to grace him with the Emperour, by their good reports of his deſerts, which albeit they had often acquainted the Emperour

with all, yet was not that ſufficient recompence as they thought, for a man of ſuch worth, and his deſert, This ſtrangeneſſe of the knight cauſed many doubts to ariſe among them, for that hee had ioyned them on their honours to make theyr apperance before his Emperiall maieſtie, and he abſent, whom they with ſuch louing deſire wiſhed to ſee. But if they grew perplexed thereat, iudge the Emperours diſcontent, who meaſuring all honourable actions, eſpecially the forward aduenturing ſouldiour, was more mooued at his ſilence and concealing himſelfe then the reſt, and the more for that his ſeruice in a time of ſuch daunger and hazard of the whole ſeignorie, hadde for his friends benefit and good of the whole Dukedome, béene ſo employed, that amongſt his cogitations and thoughts of diſcontent, ioyed in hearing the honourable aduentures of the knight, ſo largely recounted.
               Reſting thus in an extaſie, often moued to melancholie, through the knights abſence, whom he more deſired to know, then to enioy great riches, the nobles and hee in their ſecret conference many wayes deuiſed howe they might attaine what they ſo earneſtly wiſhed, in the ende, after manie imaginations howe to effect their purpoſe, the Emperour béeing verily perſwaded hée was not of his Court, that hadde for honour of his excellencie fauoured him with Title of one of his Knights, for that by their diſcription hee coulde enquire none ſuch, to bee reſident in the Cittie, or might for any enquirie finde any hope of, neuer knowing him, yet as the deſirous minde louing to effect his purpoſe, leaueth no way vnſearched, howe hard or vnlikely ſoeuer.
               The Emperour bethought him to proclaims a generall challenge at armes, appoynting great priſes for them that beſt deſerued them, beléeuing verily that if hee were eyther in his Court or his regiment, hee coulde not beeing a man at Armes, holde himſelfe in ſecret from a place where honour was to bee gayned: Hereof the whole eſtate concluding, Heraulds were diſpatched to all Cities within the empire, proclaiming

very diligently the triumph which was to be holden before the Emperour, at tilt, turney and barriers, with their ſeuerall priſes.
               
                  Alinda which had often conference with the nobles of her countrey, tooke great pleaſure to heare them diſcourſe the honour of the knight, which although ſhe could better acquaint them with, yet to ſhewe a minde of honour, ſhee wiſhed to know him, to the ende ſhe might reward him: but all in vaine, the time was not come vntill ſhee pleaſed to reueale her ſelfe.
               The time ſpending limited by proclamation, for thoſe that intended to ſhewe their forces, and gaine honour, brought from all places Princes and Nobles of great account, euerie one like themſelues, deſiring the Emperours grace, ſpared no charge, as well in ſumptuous furniſhing theyr retinew, as in their excellent deuiſes, and ſhewe of rare and incomparable wealth, which greatly pleaſed the Emperour to beholde, who longed for the day wherein hée might ſée the iſſue of this deuiſe, and ende of his hope in knowing the kn

               The princeſſe Vallia, whoſe head was not idle, deuiſing what ſhee might beſt do for her honour, and ſatiſfying the Emperour and thoſe nobles who loued and honoured her in her melancholy dumps, called vnto her Alynda her truſtie ſeruant, and to her diſcloſed the great deſire of the nobles and the Emperour to méete the knight, which had with ſuch honor behaued him in their wars, earneſtly intreating her, as before in many exigents, now ſhe would bethinke her how ſhe might in the aſſemblie ſhew her ſelfe, and eſcape vnknowne. Alinda which was not vnacquainted with the princeſſes conditions, felt her preſently, and bethinking howe deſirous ſhee was to ſhewe the nobleneſſe of her minde, tooke that charge vppon her, aſſuring the Princeſſe that if ſhée would bée ruled by her, ſhée woulde nowe ſatiſfie her minde heerein, and againſt the time, though it were but ſhort, furniſh her with all things neceſſarie to her content: at which conſent of

her Alynda, without whome ſhe was not her ſelfe, embracing her, and after for ioy kiſſng her chéekes, ſhee gaue her manie thankes, and many bountiful promiſes of reward, which was as much as Ailnda required, whoſe care was wholly to winne and maintaine the Princeſſes loue vnto her, as by her dutifull loue and ſeruice was euer ſhewen.
            
            
               CHAP. XXXVII.
               How the Princeſſe, by Alindaes helpe, was furniſhed like: Knight at armes.
               
                  NOw followeth (gentles) that I recount vnto you, the care and great regard of Alinda for the Princeſſe, who vſed ſuch diligence, that againſt the prefixed time of turney, the princeſſe was puruaide of al néedfull things, horſe, armour, launce, and cur
                  
                     •
                  elex, fitting the moſt accompliſhed knight in thoſe confines.
               The princeſſe ſéeing all thing ſo exquiſite puruaide, highly in her heart commended her truſtie ſeruaunt, whoſe kindneſſe and loue ſhee valued of more eſtéeme then all the treaſures the earth can affoord, contemplating ſome time on the woorthineſſe of a faithfull friende, and the deliuerance of a ſeruaunt: ſhee called ſodainely her Alynda vnto her, vnto whom ſhe ſaid. Alinda, faithfull and kind Alinda, in many experiments and great occaſions I haue found thy loyaltie and truſt ſuch, that my ſtudies are wholly how to requite thée, wherefore my truſt (quoth the princeſſe) and therewithall embracing her in her armes of tender loue, bedewing her chéekes with teares, willed her to aſke whatſoeuer was in her power to giue, & ſhe ſhuld haue it. Alinda which ſaw her Lady in this humor, thought ſhe looked for no leſſe then was then offered, rendering thanks for her gracious opinion, with prety conceited parley put off their talke for that time, beſéeching her to

make triall of thoſe things which ſhe had promiſed, whereunto the princeſſe agréed.
               
                  Alynda firſt opening her Trunke, ſuted her firſt in a doublet and hoſe: that done, arming her in all poynts, ſhée ſéemed ſecond to none, but a knight of as great woorth as any. What ſeuerall ſpéeches of commendations paſſed at her arming, I omitte, lette Ladyes which for recreation ſometimes amongſt themſelues vſe like merriment, cenſure of the reſt, onely I ſhall recount vnto you Alinda her forgetfulneſſe, that hauing all other things beſéeming what ſhe had vndertaken, wanted a ſhield with ſome deuiſe to preſent his imperiall maieſtie, as the manner of men at armes is. This forgetfulneſſe Alinda in her ſelfe greatly blamed, that prettily excuſed her ſelfe to anoyde blame, which the princeſſe with a pretie ieſt put off, laying both their heads together for performance of their want, and fitting their deuiſe anſwerable, firſt ſetting downe one thing, then another, all ſéeming good and verie effectuall, yet euerie ſeuerall counſell ſurpaſſing other, they were doubtfull which to except, Standing thus aſtonied, Alinda, which was euer at the dead lift moſt ſharpeſt witted, thus ſayd. Madame, your grace hath many times carried good and gracious opinions of me, which I deſire may euer be continued towards me, if now my credit may be ſuch with you, referre this charge vnto me, and doubt not but it ſhal be effected to your content. Inough Alinda quoth the princeſſe, I take thy word, and on thy care relie, be it as ſhou wilt: ſo diſarming her ſelfe, and attyring her in her owne attyre, accompanied with her ladies and Gentlewomen of honour, entred the preſence, where ſhee found the Emperor and thoſe nobles of Genoway, vnto whom ſhe was moſt heartily welcome: whom to their pleaſant diſcourſes we leaue, to tel you further of Alynda, and her carefull regard of her promiſe to the princeſſe.

                  taining their tender cheekes, bewayled his want of company, and more greeued for that they all doubted of his welfare, by reaſon of his breach of promiſe with them, not ſhewing himſelfe to them, which came onely of purpoſe to méete him there. But to our matter.
               As time nor tyde ſtayeth not, ſo the long deſired day is come, wherein thoſe noble perſonages, whereof the numbers was great, that from al princes courts where they there aſſembled, muſt trie their for
                     •
                  es, amongſt which there wanted nothing, which to honour and armes appertained, each thing with ſuch coſt and diuerſitie of deuiſes, as not onely the rareneſſe of the ſhewes delighted, but the coſt and excéeding richneſſe was more admired, ſo that a generall plauditie was giuen the Emperour for his bountie, curteſie, & exceeding coſt.
               Theſe things ordered & all other néedful matters befitting the time and the place. The princeſſe which were before appointed to bee principall beholders of theſe paſtimes, could not deuiſe with what cunning deuiſe to bring her deſires to

effect, for which ſhe grew ſo melancholike, that her neareſt attendants durſt not come neare her, fearing to offende her. Theſe paſſions Alinda well noted, and ſought many wayes in her ſubtile ſhifting head, to diſburthen her Lady of thoſe great greeſes: ſo long deuiſing, that ſhée thought no way ſo ſufficient as to cauſe her cunningly to counterfeit ſome diſtemperature of her bodie, and hereon reſoluing, without acquainting the Princeſſe therewith, ſhee preſently ſent worde by the Princeſſe Squire to the Emperour, of the ill diſtemperature of the Princeſſe, whome ſhee willed further to ſay as occaſions were offered and queſtions demaunded, of the manner of her agonie, to tell him, that about the middeſt of the night, all being in their dead ſléep, ſodainely the princeſſe ſtarted out of her bedde, running about the chamber like one lumatike, crying nothing but on her Lorde, Edward, Edward, of England, bitterly crying and exclaiming her Lord Edward was ſlaine, that ſhe would come to auenge her on thoſe miſcreants that had murthered him.
               With this meſſage the gentleman being parted, haſteneth to the Court, and came ſo earlie, as none of the priuie chamber were ſtirring, yet made ſuch meanes as hee beſt coulde to deliuer his meſſage, which no ſooner the Emperour heard, with the manner and ſtraunge efficacie of her maladie, but nearely touched with the vnhappie hearing thereof, hée called for his apparrell, and ſending for his learnedeſt phiſitians, hée queſtioned of the occaſion of the princeſſe gréefe and vnaccuſtoined agonyes, wherewith they were all aſtonied, yet taking aduiſe amongſt themſelues, diuerſly cenſuring the occaſion, they deliuered theyr opinions thus, that the princeſſe often meditating on her Lorde in his abſence by ſome fearefull dreame, might bee in her ſléepe combred, and doubted not after ſome quiet reſt, but ſhee ſhoulde recouer her health againe. This comforted the Emperour, who more regarded her health then all the worlde, of ſuch tender affection was his loue to the Princeſſe planted.
               
                  
Now Alynda that had platted her deuiſe vnknowne to the princeſſe, when ſhe had ſent her meſſenger away, came vnto the Princeſſe, and vnto her deliuered the diſcourſe of her intention, which ſomewhat aſtoniſhed the princeſſe, and put her to an nonplus, that not knowing how a matter ſo beganne, ſhould be ſo cunningly effected, but ſome likelihood of diſſembling would appeare, ſhe exclaimed on Alinda, rattling and reuiling her for her preſumption in attempting a matter ſo nearely touching her honour, without acquainting her therewith.
               
                  Alinda which hadde endured more ſhowers and greater thunder cracks then the princeſſe could now rattle, quietly diſgeſted her extremitie of ſpéech, but no ſooner gan the winde to ouerblow, and the heate of her rage allayed: but Alynda which held her credite great, and carefully héeding her Ladies good, ſubmitting her ſelfe to the princeſſe, ſhe beſought her to regard all their goods, who had done this for her Ladiſhips good, and to colour all which, and well effect her deſires, faine ſome long ſléep, that if the Emperor ſhuld ſend to ſée her, they which ſhuld come might haue no ſpéech with her. To this counſel of her old ſureſby the princeſſe liſtned, & promiſed to performe what ſhe directed. Scantly had they queſtioned of effecting what they wiſhed, but one knocking eaſily at the chamber doore, brought word that the Emperor with his phiſitians were come to viſit the princeſſe: to whom Alinda returned this anſwere with out aduiſement, that ſhe was lately fallen aſléepe, and beſought his highneſſe to pardon her a while, and forbeare to comber her, whom they all hoped would be well amended by her reſt. The Emperor whoſe carefull doubts of her health, might not ſo be ſatiſfied, would haue no deniall, but taking with him two phiſitions, entred her chamber, ſo eaſily as might not awake her: all which demeanour of theirs, the princeſſe liſtned héedefully vnto, and with great delight noted the lamentable diſcourſe of Alinda, relating the meane of her diſeaſe, which made the Princeſſe ſmile to her ſelfe, and oftentimes to frame her fittes accordingly, to the great admiration of the Emperour and all the beholders, which more gréeued them,

eſpecially the emperor, for that the time of paſtime was ſo néer, which they might not with honor recall. This diſpairing of the Princes health, when the Emperor had bin an
                     •
                  ie witneſſe of, what was reported, loath to awake her whom he thought ſlept ſoundly: as quietly without any noiſe making as he could, hee left her to her reſt, calling a councell amongſt his nobilitie what was beſt to be done, either for proroging ye appointed paſtimes, or performing thē, according as they were expected. On which they had with diuerſitie of counſaile, and ſundrie opinions debated, it was generally concluded, the triumphs to begin and hold, wheron a trumpet ſounded at the court gate, to giue euerie combattant notice thereof, whereat the Princes and Alynda ioyed much. The Emperor, though his care was great, and ſorrow more for the Princes ſicknes, yet ſhewed himſelfe froilike, the better to welcome the Princes ſtrangers, whō he wold not willingly diſcontent. But framing himſelf to mirth, as he beſt could, not without ſome touch of heauineſſe, he bad them almoſt hartily welcome, paſſing the time of dinner which they made ſhorter, by reaſon of their great buſineſſe, whom to their preparations we leaue, to returne to the princeſſe and Alynda, who not idle, but buſily imployed about their affayres: after the Princeſſe by Alynda had giuē ſtraight charge, that none ſhuld be ſo hardy to come néere her lodging, ſhe armed herſelfe, and at the time appointed was fully furniſhed as ſhe could deſire, Alynda being likewiſe ſuited, in rich attyre, be fitting more the gallanteſt Courtier, then a Ladie. After ſhe had prepared all things and their horſes orderly brought to the place by her appoynted, the princes attending to heare of the Emperors comming to the place of triumph, worde was brought Alynda, by her truſtie meſſenger, which was no ſooner heard, but Alynda mounting herſelfe on her hackney with a horne richly bawderickt about her necke, poſted towards the Emperor. By which time the tilters were ready to ioyne. But hearing Alinda wind her horne (as the vſuall maner of paſtimes is) they made ſtay of their courſes, and diſcharged their ſtaues. The Emperor and all the Nobles hearing this ſudden approch of a poſt, ſent preſently

a herauld to know the meaning, and what hee was that entred the place in ſuch manner, by whom ſhe was brought to the Emperors preſence, where doing her dutie as ſhee that could well demeane her ſelfe, ſhe ſaid. Muſe not (magnificent and mightie Prince) at this ſuddaine comming of a ſtranger: the ſimple meſſenger of a Knight aduenturous, who on ſome vrgent occaſions hath made longer ſtay, then either he deſired, or his dutie would allow: yet not willing to looſe this oportunitie of ſhewing his loue vnto your excellencie, is now, though too too late, arriued in this citie, and by me craueth to bee accepted into this noble aſſembly, to ſhew his forces in honour of your highneſſe, amongſt thoſe honoured Princes and eſtates. The Emperour, and all the aſſembly attentiuely liſtning to the meſſenger, commended highly the audacious d
                     •
                  meanor of the ſuppoſed young man, thinking his maiſter to be no other but as the meſſenger reported, and loath to refuſe his proffer, without enquirie from whence he was, or of what degree, they willing with a generall voice ſayde, he ſhould be moſt heartilie welcome, cauſing a herauld to commaund the company to ſtay vntill the Knights comming. Alynda hauing made this intermedium to their purpoſe, made no tarrying, but with al poſſible haſte returned where ſhe left the Princeſſe, who being alreadie mounted, attending her Alynda, who no ſooner had the Emperours aunſwere, but ſetting forwards, guided by her truſtie Page Alynda, they arriued ſhortly at the place of triumph, into which entring, bowing her ſelfe vnto her horſe necke, vnto thoſe ſhe firſt met, ſhe paſſed her horſe by ye tilt, with ſuch a coū
                  tenance, and maieſtical grace, that euery one admired, both her perſon, and good demeanour, euery one cenſuring of her, yet none knowing what he ſhould be: comming néer vnto the place where the Emperour was, in like maner with thrée lowly and courtlike courteſies, ſhee ſaluted him: where ſtaying, Alynda deliuered her ſhéeld, vnto his princely hands wheron was portraied her own pioure aruied, holding in chaines thrée princes, which ſubiected themſelues to her, ſw
