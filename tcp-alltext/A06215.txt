Knowe ye that our ſayde ſoueraigne Lady the Quene, hauyng compaſſion of the eſtate of that her Citie, becauſe of the long viſitation therof with the plague, and beyng deſirous that it myght pleaſe almightie God to continue the inclinatiō of his mercy towardes the ſame, by ceaſſing of the infection therof vtterly, ſo as the aſſemblees of her Iuſtices and miniſters, myght returne thyther ſafely, to miniſter Iuſtice and lawe, and all others her good louyng ſubiectes to repayre alſo thyther, and receaue comfort therof, according to the neceſſitie of theyr cauſes, and as heretofore hath ben accuſtomed: Hath therfore thought meete and agreable to the wyll of almightie God, to cauſe all maner of good orders that may be deuyſed for this purpoſe, to be ſpedyly and duely executed. For whiche purpoſe, by her Maieſties expreſſe commaundement geuen to vs, both by her gracious ſpeache and letters: We to whom the gouernaunce of the ſayde Citie vnder her Maieſtie doth belong, in the ryght of our ſayde ſeuerall offices aboue mentioned, do wyll and ſtrayghtly commaunde you, that you ſhall accordyng to the good example of the orders deuiſed by the ryght honorable the Lorde Maior of the Citie of London, and the Aldermen of the ſame, publiſhe this our order folowyng, and the ſame cauſe to be duely obſerued and kept.
            Fyrſt, we wyll and commaunde you in the name of our ſayde ſoueraigne Lad the Quene, that all and euery perſon, now kepyng, or that hereafter ſhall kepe any manſion houſe, Inne, lodgyng, or ſhoppe, within that Citie or liberties, beyng at this preſent, or that hereafter ſhalbe viſited with the plague, or that hath ben viſited within twenty dayes before this preſent daye: do forthwith after the publication hereof, ſhutte vp both theyr dores and wyndowes towardes the ſtreates or common wayes, by the ſpace of fortie dayes, then next enſuyng, from the laſt tyme of the viſitation or ſuch ſicknes of any perſon within theyr ſayde houſe or ſhoppe, and that nother the owner, maſter, or keper of the ſame houſe or ſhoppe, nor any perſon belongyng to the ſame houſe, at any tyme within the ſame ſpace, go forth of the ſame, or procure or permit any perſon, beyng cleane or whole, and not infected with the ſayde 
                  •••
               
               tagious ſicknes, to reſort or come into theyr houſe or ſhoppe, vppon payne to be committed to the op
                  ••
                ſtockes, and there to abyde the ſpace of ſeuen dayes, or leſſe, or more, as the Bayliffe and Headboroughes and head Conſtables of the Paryſhe ſhall thynke meete: and after that, to be committed to the commen gayle, there to remayne vntyll the ende of fortie dayes, from the tyme of the fyrſt cōmitting to the ſtockes, without bayle or maynpryſe. And yet becauſe Chriſtian charitie requireth, that yf it ſhall happen that the keper or owner of the houſe or ſhoppe, which ſhalbe thus ſhutte vp as afore is ſaide, be ſo poore as the ſame cannot without ſome reliefe of other good people, abyde in theyr houſes, and ſuſteyne them ſelues and famyly with neceſſary victuell and fuell: Therfore the ſayde officers aforeſayde, with the Curate of euery paryſhe, and the Churchwardens of the ſame, ſhall cauſe a collection to be made euery Sunday, or oftener, of the charitie of all the inhabitauntes of the paryſhe, and ſhall appoynt and order certayne honeſt charitable perſons, with the ſayde collections, to relieue the ſayde poore infected perſons, with ſuche kynde of victuell and fuell, as ſhalbe mete and requiſite for the perſons ſo ſhutte vp and forbidden to come abrode, duryng the foreſayde ſpace of fortie dayes.
            AND further, where it is euidently knowen that in the ſayde Citie of Weſtminſter, there be greater numbres of people inhabytyng, and as it were ſwarmyng in euery rome, than can reaſonably haue theyr ſuſtentation by theyr honeſt labours or trade of lyuyng, by reaſon that for gredineſſe and lucre▪ many owners or tenauntes of houſes, do take in to them other inhabitauntes and famylyes, to dwell in ſome part of theyr chambers, ſhoppes, cellers, or leanetooes, paying for the ſame alſo ſuche exceſſyue wekely, or other kynde of rentes, as they can not maynteyne them ſelues without ſekyng the ſame by ſundry kyndes of diſorder. For remedy wherof, there hath ben in that Citie auncient good orders and burges lawes prouided: Therfore it is ordered, that all maner of perſons that dwell in any houſe, which hath ſerued within theſe twelue monethes but for one houſehold, ſhall ſuffer no perſons, other then ſuch as ſhalbe without fraude knowen to be part of theyr famylye, to dwell and abyde, otherwyſe then geſtes do in Innes, or ſtrangers do hyre theyr lodgynges for ſome ſmall tyme, in any part of theyr ſayde houſes, after the .x. of Apryll next: but that other the one or the other famylye ſhall remoue from thence, and the whole houſe, with the chambers, ſhoppes, and cellers, ſhalbe occupyed but with one ruler, maſter, or keper, and one famylye thereto belongyng, vppon payne that whoſoeuer ſhall do to the contrary, ſhalbe punyſhed accordyng to the auncient orders in that behalfe heretofore deuiſed. And if that ſhall not be ſene ſufficient, further remedy ſhalbe by order prouided, as to ſuch a caſe is requiſite.
