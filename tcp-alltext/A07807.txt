Containing three Parts: The two former belong to the Reply vpon the Moderate Anſwerer; the firſt for Confirmation of the Diſcouerie in theſe two points, Treaſon and Aequiuocation: the ſecond is a Iuſtification of Proteſtants, touching the ſame points. The third Part is a large Diſcourſe confuting the Reaſons and grounds of other Prieſts, both in the caſe of Rebellion, and Aequiuocation.

            TO THE PVISSANT AND MOST RENOVVMED PRINCE, OVR GRACIOVS SOVEraigne, Iames by the grace of God King of great Britaine, France and Ireland, Defender of the Apostolike faith, &c.
            
            
               IT is not long ſithence (moſt gracious Soueraigne) that one inſcribed A moderate Anſwer, did traduce before your Maieſtie the late Diſcouerer of Romiſh rebellious Poſitions for an iniurious and ſlanderous Pamphleter: Now therefore Innocencie, which (Gen. 2. 25. 
               though naked) was neuer aſhamed, hath charged me to manifeſt my ſelfe vnto your Highneſſe, and, together with my Aduerſarie, to appeale vnto your incomparable wiſedome, which I do in ſo conſtant aſſurance of an vpright conſcience, as that I ſhall willingly remit that iuſt aduantage, which the difference of compariſon both betweene a legitimate or conformable ſubiect, and a perſon ſuſpiciouſly degenerate; as alſo betweene a Miniſter of ſimple truth, and a profeſſed Aequiuocator, doth offer vnto me: and to be contented onely with that reſpect which the equitie of my cauſe may allow. It hath pleaſed

my Aduerſarie thus to decipher me: Anſwer cap. 1. in initio. 
               The Diſcouerer (ſaith he) is like to the eſpiall of king Alexander, who brought word that an army of enemies was approching, whē they were but a ſmall companie of ſillie Apes, imitating ſouldiers in a march from the mountaines: thus he, as a man diſtempered in his braine, and deluded in his fantaſie, hath beheld our Catholike Prieſts, whom in euery page he calleth ſeditious and traiterous perſons. This then onely was my error; I thought, indeed, that I had diſcouered a companie of men, but my Anſwerer telleth me they were but beaſtes: and I partly beleeue him, for what men could euer be ſo ſauage, as (for ſo they haue profeſſed concerning Proteſtants) to depriue men of the due reſpects of all humanitie? Notwithſtanding though I had bene ſo much miſtaken, as not to know that his Monks were but Munkies, and his Prieſts but Apes, yet ſure I am (and he ſo acknowledgeth) that they were a companie of creatures which did imitate ſouldiers on the mountaines. This I then partly diſcouered, and now (God willing) will proue more plentifully in this Replie. The mountaines, from whence they march, be thoſe Apoc. 17. 9. 
               Seuen hils of Babylon, whereon the woman clothed in ſcarlet ſitteth: which (by the confeſſion of two moſt learned Ribera & Viega in their commē
                  taries vpon this place. Ieſuites) doth ſignifie Rome, as it muſt be in the dayes of Antichriſt. May it now pleaſe your ſacred Maieſtie, to ſee how exactly they imitate Souldiers in their march? Parſons, teaching perſecution againſt all Kings and States Proteſtant, doth propound for his imitation the example of Dauid in his conflict againſt Goliah; Allen the example of Eliah in calling, if it were poſſible, for fire from heauen to conſume the meſſengers of Kings; Renalds the example of Iabel to knocke Generals on the head; Bellarmine

the example of Iehoida and other Priestes for murthering of oppoſite Queenes; Sanders the example of Mattathias, who fought againſt King Antiochus; Simancha the example of Heatheniſh Scythians, who murthered their naturall King Scyles; Buchier the example of Sampſon, to kill, if they can, a thouſand, of his ſuppoſed Philistims with the iaw-bone of an Aſſe. Theſe, and many ſuch like be but his ſillie Apes: which I ſhould rather iudge to be of that kind whereof the prouerbe ſpeaketh, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , becauſe they cannot be diſcerned but by euents. But this Moderate anſwerer may be referred to our faithfull Replie, wherein he will appeare often to haue betrayed his owne title, except ſome will call that moderation, which hath in it neither modum nor rationem. After the Replie is finiſhed, there is preſented to your Princely and moſt religious iudgement, a Confutation of the reaſons of two of their more then vnreaſonable poſitions; as namely, of hainous rebellions, and execrable aequiuocations: both which are refelled (I hope) ſufficiently by the teſtimonies of their owne moſt principall Doctors. A courſe which I profeſſe in all diſputes; knowing that by no better wiſedome may this new Babylon be confounded, then wherwith God wrought the deſtruction of the old, euen Gen. 11. 7 & 9 
               The diuiſion of their tongues. In the firſt part of the Confutation is examined the ambition of Romiſh prelacie, who would aduance their myters aboue ſcepters: which vſurpation the right honorable Earle of Northampton, at the arraignement of Garnet, did, according to his ſingular learning formed and habited with ſound iudgement, publikely conuince of palpable noueltie, and inſolencie intollerable. In the laſt place is diſcouered the other myſterie of iniquitie, a

booke which hath this inſcription by the Author, A Treatiſe of Aequinocatiō, but thus altered by the Authoriſer thereof, A Treatiſe againſt lying and fraudulent diſſimulation. We reade of the idolatrous Iewes, who, worſhipping a Exod. 32. 5. 
               Golden calfe, did name their adoration of an abhominable idole, an holy day vnto the Lord. Plutarke maketh mention of certaine Apothecaries who painted vpon their boxes of poiſon the titles of Antidote or Preſernatiues against poiſon. Polydore obſerueth, that the Popes a long time in their election had their names chā
               ged by Antiphraſe, viz. the elected if he were by naturall diſpoſition fearefull, was named Leo; if cruell, Clemens; if vnciuill Vrbanus; if wicked, P
                     •…
                  s; if couetous, Bonifacius; if in all behauiours intollerable, Innocentius. So now this Popiſh Treatiſe of aequiuocation, the notableſt Art of lying, & moſt bottomleſſe diſſimulatiō that euer the prince of darkneſſe did inuent, will be ſtyled, A Treatiſe againſt lying and fraudulent diſsimulation. Yet why may not a lying title beſt befit the doctrine of lying & diſſimulation? Which kind of publike transfiguration of ſinne into the habite of vertue, (as it were the Angell of darkneſſe into an Angell of light) S. Bernard often nameth Daemon meridianus, The diuell at noone day. Notwithſtanding leſt that the publiſhing of this curſed Arte might in reſpect of the more carnally minded, aedificare ad gehennam: edifie vnto hell (as that reuerend Biſhop of Chicheſter, & learned father of our Church hath ſaid:) I haue ſo framed this diſpute, that it may ſeeme (I hope) to be like Ariſtotle his bookes of naturall Philoſophie, So publiſhed, as not publiſhed; becauſe the clauſe of mentall Reſeruation (the taile of this ſerpent, wherin the whole poyſon lyeth) is alwayes deliuered in Latine phraſe, to

this end, that onely the guiltie partie by his ſenſible coniecture may perceiue his error confuted, and yet the ignorant, though deſirous to touch pitch, may not be defiled. Which doctrine becauſe it is acknowledged by your Highneſſe, in your admirable wiſedome, to be in Religion moſt ſacrilegious and deteſtable, in politike ſtate moſt pernitious and intollerable, & in euery actor moſt banefull to the ſoule of man: it may pleaſe your excellent Maieſtie to prouide in this behalfe for your faithfull and religious Subiects, that they neuer be ſo intoxicated with this Antichriſtian ſpirit, as either to deceiue or be deceiued thereby. Firſt not to be deceiued: but ſeeing that the authors of Aequiuocatiō are by it, as by a Gyges ring, made in a ſort inuiſible vnto Proteſtants to plot and practiſe againſt them what & when they wil, and Vlyſſes-like make a verie Polyphemus of your moſt noble State, that whenſoeuer they be asked, who is the Traitor, licence themſelues during life to anſwer (till they be cōuicted) by that aequiuocating 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               : that therfore againſt ſuch as cannot hurt vs but by our credulitie, there may be enacted, (the onely refuge of Tullie) Lex non credendi; a law of not beleeuing them. Cōcerning deceiuing by the ſame policie more ſubtle then anie Machiauelliſme, I would be a moſt humble ſuppliant to your gracious Highneſſe, not to permit anie, of what condition ſoeuer, in the cure of the diſeaſed bodie politike, (as it were driuing out poyſon with poyſon) in winding out theſe aequiuocators to aequinocate. For this purpoſe the counſell of S. Augustine is moſt ſoueraigne: Auguſt. cont. mendac. 
               Non minùs pernitiosè mentitur Catholicus, vt haereticos capiat; quàm mentitur haeretiens, vt Catholicos lateat; nec cuiquam perſuaderi potest hominem non mentiri, nè capiat; ur
                  
qui mentitur vt capiat. For it is certaine Epheſ. 4. 11. 
               We (to ſpeake in the Apoſtles tenor) haue not ſo learned Christ as the truth in Ieſus: by whom we are taught that the new man muſt cruciſie the old man, and therefore not to ſeeke by ſuch diuelliſh exorciſme to driue out Satan by Satan, but to mortifie ambition by humilitie, intemperance by ſobrietie: in briefe, to conquer all euill by goodneſſe, and therefore onely truth muſt catch and kill a lye. Let not your Maieſtie be offended with my boldneſſe in exceeding the meaſure of an Epiſtle againſt my accuſtomed breuitie in all my labors: it is Pſal. 116. 10. 
               Credidi that begetteth Ergolocutus ſum. Therfore ſpeaking from the truth, I could not but ſpeake for truth: and now, in high deteſtation both of idolatrous ſuperſtition, and helliſh aequiuocation, beſeech the God of truth to make your name glorious in Chriſtendome, in the zealous defence both of the true faith of Chriſt, and Chriſtian faithfulnes: eſtabliſhing your Maieſties kingdome in peace, your perſon in ſafetie, your ſoule in grace, your Queene in mutuall ioy, your royall Succeſſion in happie ſucceſſe as long as the world endureth; and in the end of mortalitie to crowne you all with endleſſe bleſſednes.

            TO THE SEDVCED Brethren, Grace and peace in Chriſt Ieſus.
            
               AFter that I had diſcouered vnto you (my Brethren) the hainous poſitions of your Priests, there aroſe ſome one, I thinke, of that prieſthood, entituling himſelfe A moderate anſwerer; and me A ſlanderous and lying libeller: And why? Becauſe the teſtimonies alledged (ſaith he) are falſly applied. For proofe of this, ſcarce examining one of twentie, he commonly returneth this anſwer: If this (ſaith he) be the opinion of theſe Authors, or if theſe Authors write thus &c. wilfully ſeating himſelfe in the chaire of thoſe Doctors, whom the Apoſtle hath deſcribed: 1. Tim. 1. 7. 
               They will be Doctors, and yet vnderſtand not what they ſay, nor whereof they affirme. To the manifold and manifeſt In the 1 and 2. part. proofes, I may now adde the In the third part Arguments of the ſame Prieſts for the defence of their diſcouered rebellious concluſions. By what reaſon then can my Moderate Anſwerer charge me as ſlanderouſly miſreporting that to be the doctrine of thoſe Prieſts, which the Prieſts themſelues by Reaſons labour to confirme? Wherfore I perſwade my ſelf his intent in anſwering was not to anſwer, that is, to ſatisfie the iudicious: but onely to be thought to haue anſwered, that is, to delude the too credulous: like the anſwer which the prieſts of the Synagogue did preſcribe, for repreſsing the diſcouerie of the reſurrection of Chriſt out of the ſepulcher, ſaying:

               Whileſt we ſlept his Diſciples came and ſtole him away. Common ſenſe might haue replied, How could you tell what was done when you were all aſleepe? But minds enthralled in the opinion of a neuer c
                  ••
               ing Prieſthood (which confirmed that Anſwer) could not poſsibly but erre with their Prieſts. Such, alas, is the caſe of all them, whom (becauſe they will not ſeeke or ſee the truth) God in his iuſtce 2. Theſſ. 2. 11 
               Deliueteth vp to beleeue lies, as idle and fabulous as fancies and dreames of men aſleepe. Of which kind be many of your lying Reuelations: as that of the Deliuerance of the ſoule of Traian out of the loweſt hell. Many lying priuiledges, as that temporall Donation of Conſtantine: and the other Eccleſiasticall forged Canon for Appeales to Rome. Many lying Traditions, as that Bodily aſſumption of the bleſſed Virgin into heauen. Many lying Saints, as that of Saint Chriſtopher (except in a picture) neuer ſeene. Many lying Sanctities, as that of S. Francis in harboring of alouſe. Many lying Hiſtories, as the Goldē Legend, an abſtract of a leaden braine. Many lying reports, as of the now Miracles among the Indians: to omit many lying prophecies and reports; with infinite ſuch other, which they call Piae fraudes, that is, godly coſinages: inuented to keepe the people in deuotion, and their prieſthood in eſtimation. But that which excelleth all the rest in falſhood, is their Aequiuocation, as being not onely alying Art, but alſo an Art of lying. This is now practiſed (as will be proued) in moſt deteſtable periuries for couert of the horrible treaſons of their prieſthood: teaching you to imitate the wiſedome of the Oſtrich; which bird, if ſhe can but couer her head, thinketh all her bodie ſafe. Notwithſtanding that Romiſh See, like to the Jud

               Prou. 6. 17. 
               Lying tongues, and hands that ſhedde bloud; 
               Eſa. 59. 3. 
               Hands defiled with bloud, and tongues that ſpeake lies: Such are their hands of Treaſon, and tongues of Aequiuocation. But hearken a little, 2 Tim. 3. 4. 
               In the laſt dayes (ſaith the Apoſtle) ſhall come perillous times, when men ſhall be voide of naturall affection, truce-breakers, falſe accuſers, Traitors. All which we proue to be the expreſſe characters of your Prieſts. O but it may be thought that the Apoſtle doth not deſcribe any that do ſuch things with any religious intent, but onely deſperate and profane miſcreants, who make no conſcience of ſinne: not ſo: for in the next words the Apoſtle deſcribeth the colour of their cloake: 2 Tim. 3. 5. 
               Hauing (ſaith he) a ſhew of godlineſſe, but denie the power thereof. A propheſie plainely verified by your Prieſts in their godleſſe practiſes and godly pretences. Wherefore you are exhorted in the words following, Turne away from ſuch.

                           I anſwer, that this Poſition of the Diſcouerer, [All Proteſtants in the cenſure of Catholikes are Heretikes and Excommunicate,] is no generall aſſumption in Catholike Religion: from whence it will follow, that none of our Poſitions are to be iudged rebellious; becauſe he telleth vs that all theſe are builded vpon this Aſſumption.
                        
                     
                     
                        A faithfull Reply.
                        By which anſwer I am chalenged to a double imployment: firſt, to confirme this my former Aſſumption, [All Proteſtants in the common cenſure of Papiſts (ſuperarrogantly called Catholikes) are eſteemed as Heretikes and Excommunicate: the ſecond, to improue this your illation and conſequent, [If we iudge not

Proteſtants Heretikes and excommunicate, it will follow that our Poſitions cannot be proued rebellious.] Our Aſſumption you impugne both by ample aſſeueration, and alſo (in your opinion) by learned proofes a

                           Anſwer chap. 2. § VVherfore. 
                           I ſuppoſe that not one particular learned Catholike in this Kingdome (yet ſuch can beſt iudge of our country cauſe) doth or will defend this opinion, that Protestants are Heretikes and excommunicate: for there is not one Proteſtant eſteemed with vs to be in that caſe within the dominions of our Soueraigne, of condition whatſoeuer in my knowledge.
                        
                     
                     
                        The Reply.
                        What is this? No Papiſt doth iudge any Proteſtant an Heretike or excommunicate to your knowledge? As though you could inſtruct vs, how to know, when you ſpeake from your knowledge: knowing that you profeſſe your ſelfe to be one of that ſect, who cannot poſſibly be knowne of vs, ſo long as you lurke in the hole of that Foxe, which you call Aequiuocation. And ſurely this your minſing Suppoſe giueth vs cauſe to ſuſpect in you ſome ſuch prodigious conceit: whereof Part. 3. hereafter. In the inſtant we may demand, why you, who fetch all practiſes and poſitions, as it were Dagges and their caſes, from beyond the ſea, ſhold now ſtand only to the iudgment of the Papiſts of This kingdome in this your Countrie caſe? Is the cauſe of vs Proteſtants the ſame, and ſhall we be ſubiect to contrarie Tribunals? Haue you 1. Reg. 12. 29. 
                           One God in Dan, and another in Bethel? Not, but that we wiſh that the ſame ſea, which ſeuereth our country Region from Rome, might likewiſe diſtinguiſh your Religion. But, to leaue your Suppoſe, we will examine your proofe.

                        None onely internally infected, but he that is a manifeſt profeſſor, is ſubiect to the cenſure of Excommunication for Hereſie. But Proteſtants (in our opinion) are of theſe conditions (implying that they be doubting, and not reſolute; ignorant of the contrarie Romiſh faith, and not vnderſtanding; internally infected, and not outward Profeſſors of their faith) Therefore (in our opinion) no Heretikes.
                     
                     
                        The Reply.
                        We may not be ignorant, firſt, that, ſeeing the nature of Hereſie is ſuch, that Malitia huius peccati in intellectu, non voluntate conſummatur. Vaſques Ieſuita diſt. 126. cap 3. num. 6.

Do not Miniſters preach publikely, and people alſo profeſſe the contrarie? Doth not the King and whole ſtate enact lawes, and Magiſtrates execute them to ruinate your Babel?

                        The Reply.
                        I haue iuſtly manifeſted your darkneſſe, and now alſo hold it neceſſarie to continue a Diſcouerer, when you make your ſelfe ſo notorious a couerer of ſo many palpable vntruths, which I muſt vnfold in euery paſſage. For the preſent three. 1. No communion forbid to any before Excommunication. 2. No Heretike, not excommunicate by name, is ſubiect to any penaltie. 3. No Proteſtant is excommunicate by name. The falſhood of all which is diſcouered by the iudgement of your owne ſchoole. Firſt, Panormitan, you know, defendeth that Iam ſupra lit. a 
                           When the hereſie is publikely knowne, there needeth no pronunciation of the ſentence of Excommunication. But this is but as one ſwallow with you. Whatſoeuer (ſay you) the Diſcouerer obiecteth from Panormitan, &c. to make your Reader ſuſpect, that I relyed onely vpon the iudgement of Panormitan for a point of ſo neceſſary conſequent. Did I not alledge alſo your moſt famous Ieſuite Gregorie of Valentia for confirmation thereof? though then indeed the exigence of time would not permit me to tranſlate it, and my preſumption of a Modeſt Anſwerer whomſoeuer (as of one that would vnderſtand Latin) thought it alſo ſuperfluous:

yet now for your better information, and the Readers ſatisfaction, I am conſtrained to Engliſh it.

                           If the guilt of hereſie be ſo notorious (ſaith he) as that by no euaſion it can be concealed, the partie doth incurre the penaltie thus farre, that his ſubiects may denie ſuch a Lord all fealtie, yea before the ſentence of iudgement.
                        
                        I did alſo alledge a third, namely, Bannes, a man famous among your Doctors, and guarded in this point with the common conſent of the ſchoole. His words are theſe: In hoc Articulo, &c. Infra Rat 4. 
                           In this Article do Felinus and Caietan, and the more common opinion of the Scholers of Thomas concurre: prouing that the euidence of the fact is as effectuall in this caeſe, as a publike ſentence in iudgement. I did furthermore (pardon me if I muſt diſcouer your partiall concealements) adde yet another Ieſuite, your Father Creſwell, auouching that this opinion Hoc vniuerſa Theologorum, &c. Infra Rat 4. 
                           Hath the vniuerſall conſent of Lawyers and Diuines. I might haue cited more witneſſe to appeare, if I had thought it as neceſſarie for euidence to the cauſe, as I feared leſt it ſhould be tedious to the iudicious Reader.
                        But leſt you or I may ſeeme to uniſconſtrue (becauſe you name it) the Lateran Councell, giue your owne Doctors leaue to interprete it.

                           It is euident (ſaith your Ieſuite) from this Decree of the Councell of Latèran; If the Prince fall into the ſentence of the Canon, forthwith he falleth into the penaltie denounced, before any further iudgement.

That no Engliſh Proteſtant is excommunicate by name, how can you warrant vs? If they be all excommunicate in the name of Engliſh, or in the name of Caluiniſts, or in the name of Proteſtants, or in the name of Heretikes; are they not namely excommunicate? To expect that all Heretikes ſhould be cited by their ſirnames of Teſimond, Garnet, Blackwel, &c. is againſt the tenor of Councels in this word Anathema, as will appeare. Shall we thinke that the grand Heretikes, the Arrians, were thus formally denounced? This in thoſe times, for their infinite number, had bene impoſſible: much leſſe can it be poſſible in theſe dayes, (though the Heretikes were but ten) becauſe each partie by change and multiplication of names, may alter his ſummons; as by your late example to be called The Proclamation againſt Garnet. 
                           Garnet, aliâs Wally, aliâs Darcey, aliâs Farmer, aliâs Philips: and ſo, like an Indiuiduum vagum, in infinitum. But I diſpute.
                        Thoſe who both doctrinally and practically apply the lawes and cenſures of Excommunication, proper to obſtinate Heretikes, vnto the profeſſed Proteſtants of all conditions, do thereby manifeſt that all profeſſed Proteſtants be, in their opinion, obſtinate Heretikes. But all Romiſh Prieſts and Ieſuites

do apply the ſentences and cenſures, which they hold to be proper to Heretikes, and truly excommunicate, againſt all ſorts of profeſſed Proteſtants. Ergo your former Suppoſe can be no ſufficient repoſe for any Proteſtants to relye vpon.

Volentes vt de Imperi, finibus haereticae labis germina modis omnibus deleantur. Conſtit. Vrban. 4. Cap. 2. § Statuimus, & § Siverò. 
                              We decree that all Heretikes within the Empire, by what name ſoeuer they be called, be puniſhed, and that by all meanes they be rooted out. The Bull of Pope Paulus 3. againſt King Henry the eight: the forme: Praeterea ſub Excommunicationis poenamandamus, ne vllus Princeps Chriſtianus dicto Henrico Regi Angliae, eius nominis octauo, aut eius fautoribus, directe vel indirectè ſub praetextu confederationum & obligationum quarumcunque etiam iuramento aut quauis alia firmitate roboratarum: quas omnes confoederationes atque obligationes factas abſoluimus, & ſanciendas ſub eadem poena prohibemus.

                              We, vnder the paine of Excommunication, commaund,

that no Prince Chriſtian entertaine any league or couenants with this King, or any of his followers, or fauourers whomſoeuer: but that euery one of any condition do take armes againſt them, thereby to compell them to the obedience of the ſee of Rome.

                              We excommunicate and anathematize all Huſſits, Caluiniſts, Lutherans, Zwinglians, Hugonots, and all other that receiue or fauoitr them, by what name ſoeuer they be called; and generally whoſoeuer ſhall either publikely or priuately reade, print, or defend their bookes not licenced firſt by our authoritie▪
                               This is the Bull; can any Proteſtant now eſcape his hornes? Nay, but that we may know that theſe are thoſe Excommunications, which are à lure (as they tearme them) Excommunicatio a iure huiuſmodi eſt quae perpetuo ſtatuto lata eſt, quaeue ſemper valet, etiamſi admonitio nulla praecedat.

                        Hitherto haue we only confirmed our Antecedent, namely, That Proteſtants in the common cenſure of Papiſts, are eſteemed Heretikes: It remaineth we now diſable your conſequent following.

                           Anſwere Cap. 2. initio. 
                           HIs Aſſumption being ruinate, that Protestants are not eſteemed of vs Heretikes, or Excommunicate: it followeth, that no poſitions, which we maintaine, are rebellious; becauſe he telleth vs that all ſuch are built vpon this Aſſumption.
                        
                     
                     
                        The Reply.
                        Which [It followeth] wanteth feet to follow, becauſe there be two other reaſons to prooue your doctrine rebellious. The firſt from the effects we ſee; the ſecond from another principle of doctrine, which you generally maintaine.
                        The firſt. He that looketh vpon a goodly building, though he be deceiued in the foundation (which is the cauſe) whether it be a rock, or artificiall worke; whether wooll or ſtone, becauſe it is couered in the earth: yet can he not be ignorant in the building it ſelfe, which he beholdeth in the cleare ſunne. Whether therefore I might miſtake the cauſe of your rebellions, as not to diſcerne whether it be in the Proteſtants ſciſme, or hereſie, or in your ſelues (whereof I make no queſtion) malice, couetouſnes, or triple-crowned pride: yet when we ſhew theſe your poſitions, as it were turrets of your Babell: No Protestant may be elected a King, being inthronized muſt be excommunicate, and depoſed, and being hopeleſſe to be reclaimed during life, muſt be violently cut off by ſudden death. Neither this only, but All Protestant Magistrates and people, and their fauorers are ſubiect to like cenſures, their kingdome is to be inuaded, and themſelues expelled: Reaſon teacheth vs to iudge from

theſe doctrines of the effects to the doctrine of the cauſe, and iuſtly to eſteeme them rebellious.
                        The ſecond reaſon; though they be not yet excommunicated or cenſured Heretikes by your Pope, yet is this but durante beneplacito, or as in the Councell of Trent, [Concil. Trid. 
                                 •

Plainely ſignifying that they accounted Proteſtants heretikes before iudgement; and not that only, but before iudgement alſo (praeiudicium autem tollit iudicium) againſt common rule of iuſtice had reſolued to accompt them Heretikes euer after. As our borderers to them they haue in deadly feud, if peraduenture they find them at their owne houſe, will giue kind entertainement, yea and defend them from violence, but after they be diſmiſſed, ſaying, only for this time, do honeſtly giue them a watch-word euer after to looke to their owne ſafety. And this your ſelfe will tell vs, for Infra Cap. 13. 
                           His holineſſe (ſay you) ſent lately a iubet of obedience, and prohibet of diſobedience in behalfe of our King, therein not obſcurely confeſſing, that if the Pope ſhall turne his ſtyle of iubemus, then will you alſo turne your pikes of paremus; and what then but rebellion? Infra. 
                           Then no dutie to King, Magistrates, huſbands, wiues, creditors, fathers, children; but among all conditions of Protestants helliſh confuſion. Thinke you ſo to babiſh the wiſdome of our State, as not Ianuſ-wiſe to looke as well before them as behind? No, for when they remember what hath bene Vide ſuprae cap. 5. & Infra. 
                           Kings and Queenes Engliſh excōmunicate by the Pope, and aſſaulted by ſecret treaſons, and open inuaſions by his inſtigations; they well know that there is no ſafe repoſe in an arbitrary power of excommunication: but being warded by Gods hand from your laſt miſchiefe, will ſo prouide, as not to lye open to a ſecond terrible blow. And thus our building (if our former foundation ſhould haue failed) by theſe two reaſons might be ſufficiently ſupported. Thus much in defence of our Aſſumption. We proceed to the confirmation of our ſeuerall reaſons.

                           We muſt therefore abandon the hereſie of Neſtorious, who rather distracted then distinguiſhed the nature of Chriſt, againſt the doctrine of the holy Ghoſt in Scripture. It would therefore become your modeſtie, to haue omitted theſe imputations: but we ſhall find your moderation immoderate in this kind.

                           I will next bring in Maſter Hugh Broughton, a man greatly commended by Maſter Willet, who telleth the Biſhops of England that their tranſlation of the Scripture is corrupt; and that Chriſtianitie is denyed here in England.

                        Maſter Broughton (which I am able truly to witnes) was as greatly commended and reuerenced for his learning among your greateſt Ieſuits at Mentz, and the Biſhop elector there, yet he neuer allowed your Tranſlation, but debaſeth it more then any other: neither did he euer go to Italy or Spaine to learne Chriſtianitie there. How you ought to eſteeme of our Tranſlation, I haue made it elſewhere euident from your owne Vide Apolog. Cathol. part. 2. lib. 1. Cap 14.

                           The Admonition to the Parliament, written with no ſmall conſent, vſeth theſe words; That no man, in whom there is any ſparke of grace, or conſcience, can liue in the Church of England, whoſe inhabitants be all Infidels, going to the Churches of Biſhops, and Arch-biſhops, whoſe gouernement is Antichriſtian and diueliſh.
                        
                     
                     
                        The Reply.
                        This writer and you may both ioyne fellowſhip: You dedicate your booke to the King, he to the Parliament. He pretendeth the conſent of a thouſand; you [No Catholike will ſay Protestants are Heretikes,] implie a thouſand thouſand: He with all his conſent is not many; and you (for ought you well pretend) but one, both inuiſible and nameleſſe, neither of both able to make vp any great conſent, except you multiplie the name of forenamed Aliâs A, aliâs B. &c. You ſee what is themaladie of this Admonitor, namely, to condemne our Religion only becauſe of Biſhops, as, in his illiterate braine, an order Popiſh, and therefore Antichristian. Say now, do you thinke his Admonition tollerable? then muſt you (who do defend that Biſhop of Rome) conclude your ſelfe an Infidell, and an Antichristian hireling. Do you thinke it immoderate? then are you no moderate Anſwerer to condemne vs by that Admonition, which your ſelfe doth condemne. Let vs heare ſomething elſe which may proue Proteſtants guilty of the imputation of Turciſmes and Atheiſmes.

                           Thoſe penalties this Author alledgeth as belonging to the Excommunicate, and ſuch Heretikes, as ſpoiling them of their goods, denying Tithes; I anſwer, that theſe Societies of neighbors wiues, and ſuch like are not to be denied to the Proteſtants in England, becauſe we do not eſteeme them in the caſe of Heretikes; againe, we performe theſe communications and reſpects aſwell to our Country Proteſtants, as they themſelues. Laſtly, I anſwer that thoſe penalties mentioned were not of purpoſe ordained againſt Proteſtants, but Decrees againſt Heretikes of thoſe times, and not now in vſe in France, Heluetia, Sweueland, Denmarke, and moſt part of Germanie. And if the penall Conſtitutions of the Councell of Trent are not yet after 40. yeares continuance receiued into thoſe recited Prouinces and Kingdomes; there is not ſo great feare that thoſe Papall paines will euer giue to this man ſo much cauſe of ſo outragious exclamations.
                        
                     
                     
                        The Reply.
                        If all your Sect would allow your Anſwer, we ſhould need

no clamor: for firſt your anſwer de iure, Proteſtants are not to be demed theſe duties: ſecondly, de facto, that You do not deny them: for confirmation of the right you inferre: that Theſe puniſhments were not ordained againſt Protestants; and auouching the fact, you inſtance in other countries, where theſe penalties are not in vſe. Concerning the fact, let vs admit that theſe are performed, yet the Apoſtle diſtinguiſheth of performance of dutie, & propter Iram, & propter Conſcientiam; one for feare of ciuill power, the other for conſcience ſake. Whether bond doth tye you to obedience the ſubſequents will manifeſt. We do likewiſe acknowledge that ſome part of thoſe penalties were more aunciently ordained againſt others, and not againſt Proteſtants; What then? if they be now extended againſt Proteſtants? For thus dealt the Iewes againſt our Lord Chriſt, 1. Pet. 2. 
                           We haue a lawe, and by that lawe he ought to die, becauſe he hath ſpoken blaſphemie. The law they had, was, Holy, iuſt, and good: but the application was their owne, vngodly, furious, and murderous; we may herein compare Chriſts blaſphemie, and Proteſtants hereſie. And if your late penall Decrees of Trent be not of force in other countries, you haue giuen vs a reaſon, Quia vires deſunt: becauſe they want outward force. Otherwiſe I haue ſhewed that thoſe penalties, as non-payment of Tithes, are by your Iohn 19. 7.

                        IT is cleare (ſaith Allane) that what people and perſon ſoeuer be declared to be oppoſite to Gods Church, by what obligation ſoeuer, either of kindred, friendſhip, loyaltie, or ſubiection I be bound vnto them; I may, or rather muſt take armes againſt them: and then

muſt we take them for Heretikes, when our lawfull Popes adiudge them ſo to be. A litle after he ſtriketh an Alarme, Pag. 53. 
                        Now therefore my Lords and deare Countrimen fight, &c.

                        This Anſwer giueth vs no more ſecuritie, then the Cat doth the Mouſe, when ſhe ſeemeth but to play with it: for though you haue not a Maria, yet may your Dolman haue an Infanta, or your Catesby and his Complices an Elizabetha to match, and to ouermatch alſo at their pleaſure, making her but as a garland of flowers in a May-game, to flouriſh for a day or two, and then to wither and periſh. And before him your Watſon ſaw no metaphyſicall he or ſhe to ſucceed.

                           Owe nothing to any man, but loue one another. And therefore that debt of Tithes which Ioſeph (as due vnto them) payed to the Aegyptian

Prieſts: of Debtes and due beneuolence, which was neuer denied to Infidels: of Allegeiance and Homage, which Saint Ambroſe did performe to an Apoſtate: may not be denied to any, though in caſe of hereſie, much leſſe then to Proteſtants. But to conclude with your owne words, Thoſe duties are not to be denied vnto Proteſtants. It were well if either you writ as you thought, or that your Doctors did thinke as you write: and ſo ſhould we haue leſſe cauſe of ſcruples, to feare either you or them. Let vs proceed to the ſecond Reaſon.

                           Whereunto (ſaith your

Coſterus) ſcarce the Germans (whom you obiect) do obey. Which is very true; for, in the tenor and forme of Election and Coronation of the Emperor, you may find, as I remember, this power aſcribed to the Prince Palatine Elector, that he (as being Steward rather to the Empire, then Emperor) may cite the Emperor to the diet of the State, and conſtraine him in ſome caſe to yeeld ſatisfaction.

                        This kind of Anſwer of retorting, which you call returning the Argument vpon Protestants, you vſe in euery Anſwer: if truly, you ſhall proue your ſinne to haue bene more common, which cannot iuſtifie your ſelues; If vniuſtly, you ſhall but ſlander them and multiply your wickedneſſe.

                           His ſecond Propoſition is this, [But all Popiſh Prieſts do profeſſe a double prerogatiue ouer Kings, Democraticall or Monarchicall, namely, both people or Pope. Ergo) This his conceit fighteth with his owne Aſſertion, and preſent Poſition of the Popes Monarchicall prerogatiue ouer Kings: for where there is a Monarchicall power and gouernment in one, there is an vnpoſſibilitie of a Democracie and Democratical power and regencie in the people: and yet this ſimple Diſputer doth thus argue.

Notwithſtanding your ſimple Disputer wiſheth that he had met with ſo ſubtill an Anſwerer as could haue diſtinguiſhed betwixt mentiri, and mendacium dicere: to lye, and to report a lye. Say: this propoſition, The Pope is taught to haue a Monarchicall power ouer Kings, and people Democraticall, doth it imply contradiction? Seeing then I onely ſhew, in this preſent reaſon, that your Ieſuites defend both, it is an vnreaſonable modeſtie to fauor the Autors, and inueigh againſt me the reporter: which I haue done iuſtly in both, as will appeare in due order. Be not idle, but conforme your ſelfe to the lawes of diſpute.

is called prodigious, which is deliuered with heeles forward, from whence ſome haue receiued their names to be called Agrippa: ſuch is this politike curſe which you fancie, but remember that though, as you trulie affirme, King and ſubiect be relatiues, euen as Father and Sonne: yet conſider them in the nature, in the reall foundation as things, and not of accidentall relation; and then (I hope) you will ſuffer the Father to goe before the Sonne. And ſo Adam, as an Oecumenicall King, was before his familie; after his deceaſe, alwayes the right of gouernement was inueſted in the firſt-borne, as a birth-right: ſo God did ſignifie to Caine, [

                           Some there be (ſaith he) who imagine that the authoritie of Princes dependeth vpon the courteſie of people, as to thinke that they, who gaue conſent to chooſe Kings, haue likewiſe now a power to depoſe them: But the bleſſed Apostles, who by the holie Ghoſt were inabled to ſearch the mysteries of God, haue more profoundly enquired into the foundation of the ſtate and autoritie of Kings. * Saint Peter (ſaith he) entering into this argument, doth thus admoniſh Christians. Be ye ſubiect vnto the ordinance of man, whether to the King, as to the more excellent, or his meſſengers ſent from him; to the puniſhment of wicked, and praiſe of the godly: ſo is the will of God as free, and not as hauing libertie as a cloake of maliciouſnes, but as the ſeruants of God.

But to returne to the Oracles of God, S. Peter called mans entrance into the kingdome by conſent of people, mans creation; vpon this ground, it may be, your Reinolds did deſcant, where he called the King, mens creature: as though he could ſee in mans election nothing but man, whereas S. Peter in the ſame place ſaith to man creating, Be ye ſubiect vnto the creation of man, Propter Deum, for the Lords ſake, in the creature beholding God: Why? S. Paule will ſatisfie, Becauſe the powers that are, be ordeined of God. Rom. 13. So that mans creation is but the bodie of ſoueraintie, Gods ordinance in that meanes is the very ſoule thereof, and ought in all Chriſtians to be the life of loyall ſubiection.
                     
                     
                        The Anſwer retorted.
                        In the laſt place I muſt make bold to ſtrike you with your owne ſword: There is no King to rule (ſay you) where there is no people to be ruled: for King and people be Relata. All this is moſt true: Well now our Queſtion is, whether after the peoples election of a King the power to depoſe a King remaineſtill in the people; you affirme, we denie it, ſtrengthned by this your Argument frō relation originall, thus. The power of gouernment reſteth rather in the Ruler, then in the partie to be ruled. But a King is elected to rule the people. Ergo the rule remaineth not in the people, but in the King. In coniugall ſocietie before the contract the woman is free, but after contract (à relatis) now his wife: there followeth a neceſſitie of ſubiection, not to be diſſolued: * Let the wife be ſubiect. Notwithſtanding in your concluſion you bewray this modeſtie, to exact Learning in your Accuſer, and ſhew none in your Anſwere. Thus much of your people, now we proceed orderlie to the Pope.

                        The ſumme of your Anſwere is, that the generall doctrine of Papiſts is to denie all temporall and ciuill power abſolutely ouer Kings; and that no Pope did euer challenge it. And yet behold, before your eyes, in this Reaſon to which you now would anſwere, your owne Doctor Bozius produced againſt you, who in his booke inſcribed, De Temporali Eccleſiae Monarchia. Clementi 8. Pontifici Opt. Max. Franciſcus Bozius.

Roget quis an ſummus Pontifex ſit Dux, an Rex, an non Imperator; caute reſpondebit, ſi negando aſſerat, eſſe quid praeſtantius, quiduè eminentius. Haec ille. Et ex illo haec Carerius lib 1 de Poteſt. Rom. Pont. Cap 9. 
                           This opinion, namely, that the Pope by the lawe of God hath moſt full power throughout the world euen in all temporall or ciuill cauſes, I defend: and hereunto the common Schooles of Diuines do ſubſcribe. He numbreth two and twentie Authors, and among others one called The illuminated Doctor, and an other called Celſus, by interpretation, High or Aloft; and therfore inſignes him with Verè Celſus, as truly ſo named, and ſo truly he may be, if we iudge him by the loftineſſe of his ſtyle and cōcluſion, which only this Carerius doth therfore expreſſe, as being more eminent then any other. Such and ſo great is the ſpirituall and ciuill power of the Pope (ſaith Celſus) that as Plato to one asking what God was, anſwered, he is not man, not heauen, not good, but what? more excellent: ſo if any ſhall demaund what the Pope is; by a kind of reſemblance one may warily anſwere, he is no Duke, no King, nor Emperour, but more excellent. What can this be elſe (ſeeing God only is for excellencie called 1. Tim. 6. 15. 
                           King of Kings, and Lord of Lords) but an other God? Warily anſwered, but wickedly. Next he aſſumeth for autoritie of his defence Eadem opinion probatur ex Canoniſtarum, teſtimonio, qui ſic adhaeſerunt decreto deſumpto ex C. per venerabilem: qui filij legitimi: vt infinitum ſit illos enumerare. Carerius ibid. Cap. 9. & 10. 
                           The common iudgement of Canonists, all building this opinion vpon the Decrees of Popes. As if they ſhould ſay, if we be deceiued in our opinion cōcerning the Popes iuriſdiction, then the Popes haue deceiued vs. What is that which Pope Innocentius decreed?

Optimè explicat ſummus Pontifex hac decretali Pontificiae dignitatis eminentiam. Carerius ibid. Cap. 12. 
                           That God created two great lights, the Sunne to rule the day, and the Moone to gouerne the night: ſignifying two dignities, the ſpirituall, which is the Papall, and the temporall, belonging to to the Emperour like the Moone. Yet ſo, that there is as great difference of excellencie betwixt the Emperour and the Pope, as betwixt the Moone, and the Sunne. What can you inferre from hence? Vndè ſic formo rationem; Ea eſt proportio inter Pontificem & Imperatorem, quae eſt inter Solem & Lunam; ſed ſol eſt praeſtantior lunâ, quae ab illo mutuat ſplendorem ac lucem: Igitur Imperatoris poteſtas à ſummo Pontifice pendet.

                           That as the Moone hath no light, but that it borroweth of the Sunne: ſo the Emperour hath no power, which is not depending of the Pope. Thus Pope and popiſh by too much gazing on the Moone, are become lunatike, who by a ſpirit of pride carnally peruert the literall ſence of the holie Ghoſt, as it is Vide Apolog. Catholicam.

Here only we are to explaine them, and to ſhew, how both of them challenge a power in the Pope at his diſcretion to depoſe Kings.

But the common conſent of Catholike Diuines is, that indirectly and mediatly, that is▪ ſo farre as it may concerne the ſpirituall good of the Church, the Pope hath a ſupreme power euen in temporall cauſes, to put downe Kings, and bestow their Kingdomes. And yet you denie, Supereſt vt demōſtremus Papa non habere directe vllam temporalem iuriſdictione iure diuino. Bellar. ibid. Cap. 4.

whereunto he was ſworne, required counſell in this caſe: Sir (ſaith his counſeller) the Lawe directly forbids you this; yet there is another law which permits the King to do what he liſt. A dangerous State, where the Kings lust is his law. Now how is it in this your controuerſie? to ſay the Pope can directly iudge and depoſe Kings. O no, you will not, For (ſay you) we denie: This opinion (ſaith Bellar.) is the firſt extremitie, as though you would acknowledge that to be directly a ground of treaſon: yet you hold it lawfull, When the Pope ſhall thinke it be

in the ſame Chapter, I Anſwer (ſay you) if any man hold that opinion of ſuch power ouer Princes in Popes, yet they will pleade it more tolerable in the authoritie of one ſupreme Pastor in the Church, whereof Princes be ſheepe, &c. The argument then of theſe men, as you confeſſe, and Infra Part 3. is hereafter ſhewed, is this, As the ſhepheard to the ſheepe, ſo the Pope to Kings: but ſhepheards haue power ouer ſheepe, and not ſheepe ouer ſhepheards. Ergo Popes may depoſe Princes, and Princes may not remoue Popes. This is your Popiſh and (as it is In the third part. after proued) your ſheepiſh concluſion: wherein whether there be not offered greater indignitie to Princes, then to Popes, let the equall Reader iudge.

And theſe forenamed Authors do auouch for the confirmation of this doctrine the vniuerſall conſent of Romiſh Diuines, and Canoniſts for the ſpace of an hundred yeares. Whether therefore to affirme, that Kings may be Heretikes, and for that cauſe depoſed, and that Popes cannot be depoſed, becauſe as Popes they cannot be Heretikes, be equall indignitie to Popes and Kings, let (if you will) your vnequall Reader iudge. And now (not to ſtand vpon other tranſparent abſurdities of theſe Authors) your modeſtie is to be put in mind, not to appeale vnto equall iudgement in that, wherein you manifeſt your totall eclypſe of iudgement. Hitherto haue we diſputed of the power of people and of the Pope, conſidered as it were intenſiuely. Now we approach to examine both of them in their extent and execution.

                           His Maieſtie was not excommunicate before his Election, neither is he now, but is both elected and ſetled in his throne both without any contradiction of the Pope, and with his Iubet of all obedience, and Prohibet of deniall thereof. All the Catholikes of this Kingdome applauded it as much as Protestants, and his vnion and league with Catholike Princes and people abroad is ſufficient Anſwer, that this is a malitious ſlaunder of holy Prieſthood, and proueth Catholikes innocent, Proteſtants guiltie, and this man an vniuſt Accuſer.
                        
                     
                     
                        The Reply.
                        If his Maieſtie was not excommunicate by the Pope before his Election, (which you ſhould rather call Succeſſion) then was he vniuſtly (that I may ſo ſay) excommuned by the Pope before his Election: but your Superior Garnet confeſſed, that he had receiued two Breues from the Pope, to make vſe of, whenſoeuer our late Queene Elizabeth ſhould depart out of this mortalitie. The content of thoſe Breues was this: that Quamprimùm contigerit miſeram illa foeminam ex hac vita diſcedere, &c. Garnet bis Comfeſſion at the Barre.
                            
                           None ſhould be acknowledged King of England, but ſuch as was a profeſſed and reſolute Catholike: Nulli, quantâcunque ſanguinis propinquitate nitantur: that is, No other, though neuer ſo nigh in bloud. Which Breues, he (perceiuing the generall applauſe of people yeelding to the right of Succeſſion according to neareneſſe in bloud) burnt. Thus we ſee if the Popes power had not bene diſappointed by want of force, his Maieſty, though neareſt

in bloud, might not haue entred but with bloud. Now therefore what a caſe am I in? If I ſhall denie my fonner aſſertion, then your ſuperior Prieſt Garnet will accuſe me for a liar; for his Maieſties caſe was not different from others, ſeeing The Pope gaue contradiction to his ſucceſſion: if I ſtill defend it, then your Prieſtſhip doth accuſe me for a Slanderer of holy Priesthood.

                        Yea, Iubet of obedience? Iubet? what is that? Euery child can expound it literally to ſignifie To commaund, but by Popiſh Gloſſe may happily ſignifie to forbid: for we muſt not be ignorant of your like glozing in the publike Decrees of Popes.

                           If the Emperor (ſaith your Carerius) who is held more eminent, at leaſt in dignitie, then any King, may be reiected by the Popes: then much more other Kings may be puniſhed by the Popes authoritie. For he that can tame an Eagle, may much more command Hawkes. Here we obſerue your ſpirits of contradiction: you from compariſon of diſparitie betweene the Emperor and other Kings, would ſeeme to free Kings, and inthral the Emperor: your Doctor Carerius from the contrarie diſparitie would bring all Kings into ſubiection. But know, that howſoeuer now the Eagle be entangled, whom you eſteeme no better then the Popes vaſſall, yet Non facile Accipitri rete ſternitur.

                        And yet the now Henry 4. King of France ſucking Proteſtants doctrine from his nurce, was excluded from his birth-right of the Crowne, till he was reconciled vnto the Pope. And this ſame father Garnet had a Breue from the Pope to barre our Soueraigne from Succeſſion, except he ſhould be found abſolutely a Romiſh Catholike. If then the Borne Proteſtants be free from Excommunication, why did the Pope exclude the King of France, or by his Breue to you, except againſt the King of England? If the caſe be otherwiſe, what Quackſaluers be you to offer a ſalue which cannot poſſibly cure the ſore? I haue digreſſed a little, but I hope not tranſgreſſed; for this point was, you ſee, pertinent.

                        The Reply.
                        True, the hiſtories of thoſe times ſhew, that the Popes were after ſome 600. yeares after Chriſt alwayes quarrellous; and according to that proper name of Gregory the ſeauenth (now mentioned) called Hildebrand, the very firebrands of Chriſtendome. But how do you ſatisfie for Hildebrand? I grant (ſay you) that he that diſſolueth the obedience of Subiects to their Soueraignes, is iustlie accompted ſeditious: Here you cannot denie, but that Pope Gregorie the ſeauenth abſolued all from obedience to excommunicates. You know what followeth: Ergo, the Pope is condemned as one guiltie of high treaſon: This is commendable modeſtie, which is voide of partialitie. To the ſecond example you anſwere.

                           But he vrgeth the Gloſſe of Gregorie the ninth, and citeth the Decret where there is no ſuch matter, or any thing like vnto it.
                        
                        I commend your diligence, and wiſh you were as modeſt to acknowledge all my other truths, as I am to confeſſe this my only eſcape: which the importunitie of the time, and not the exigence of examples did occaſion. For beſides other examples, I might haue inſiſted vpon that Bull of Paulus the 3. againſt King Henry the 8. which differeth not from the tenor

of the decree alledged Supra. 
                           Wee commaund the Nobles of England by force of armes to expell Henry the 8. out of that Kingdome. This then was an error of miſtaking my Autor, not by

                           Lastlie he bringeth in the Bull of Pius Quintus againſt Queene Elizabeth: but I anſwere, that many graue and learned men haue thought the information of the caſe of Queene Elizabeth to the See Apostolike, whereupon the cenſure of Excommunication was awarded againſt her, to haue bene vntrue: and Pius Quintus, an holie man, himſelfe after bewailed the proceedings vpon ſuch ſuggestion.

Say, was the information againſt the Queene vntrue? and did Graue men ſo iudge of it? Take heed what you ſay; This anſwere will more preiudice the two principall prerogatiues of that your Romiſh See, then you are aware of; as namely, the power of canonizing Saints, and excommunicating of Princely ſinners, which both are caſes reſerued as proper to the Pope, and both proceeding (as you ſay) from the De Apoſtolicae autoritatis plenitudine declaramus &c.

                           fulneſſe of Apostolike authoritie.
                        
                        The truth of canonizing Saints; as for example, Thomas Becket, dependeth vpon true information: ſo (by your owne confeſſion) the truth of excommunication, (as of Queene Elizabeth,) muſt relie vpon a iuſt ſuggestion. Now then did your Pope Pius erre in excommunicating, and ſo in condemning e Canus locis Theolog. & Bellar. lib de Cultu Sanctorum. an innocent? and might he not likewiſe erre in canonizing an Offendor?
                        
                           
The ſecond prerogatiue which that See doth challenge is, Appeales to Rome: but ſeeing a lying fame (like a rowled ſnowball) the further it moueth the more increaſeth in her falſhood: we muſt learne wiſedome from that ancient Councell of Carthage (whereunto Saint Auguſtine did ſubſcribe) which thought it neceſſarie, for feare of falſe information, to haue all cauſes iudged in their owne Countries: and therefore did expreſlie decree againſt the See of Rome, that none ſhould make appeale beyond the Sea.
                        But becauſe this practiſe of Pius in excommunicating our late gracious Soueraigne, doth liuely exemplifie all popiſh poſitions in our late Diſcouerie, we muſt deſire your patience to be informed in the true circumſtances which concerne this excommunication, not by the witneſſe of your imagined Graue men, who, if they euer were, yet now happilie be dead in their graues: but by thoſe monuments which make the acts of dead men immortall, ſuch as the tenor of the Bull of Pius doth purport.

                           This Bull after the death of Pius Quintus, was confirmed by his Succeſſor; which the Heretikes themſelues, doubting the danger of the euent, did labour (as it is ſaid) ſecretly by great men to haue this ſentence of Excommunication repealed: But all in vaine. The Queene was and is an Heretike.
                        
                        By this Bull, and interpretation thereof, your whole moderate Anſwer is conuinced of extreme impudencie.
                        
                           
Firſt, Anſwer ſupra Cap. 1. 
                           No Protestants are by any Catholikes accounted Heretikes: yet heere, he whom you named the chiefe Shepheard, hath named our Queene and her Subiects ſixe times Supra. 
                           Heretikes. We diſpute of Buls, and Buls haue hornes: I muſt therefore encounter you with a Dilemma, which the Logitians call an Horned argument; thus, If that no Catholikes can call Protestants Heretikes, then was not Pius Quintus and his Succeſſor (both Biſhops of Rome) Catholikes; who haue numbred Proteſtants in the catalogue of Heretikes: If Proteſtants be to be iudged Heretikes, then this your Anſwere is blaſted, Protestants are no Heretikes. You are then in theſe ſtraites, either to recant your Anſwere, or to renounce your ghoſtly father.
                        Secondly, the horned ſyllogiſme doth aſſault you the ſecond time, thus: If the excommunication of our Queene by your Pius was iuſt, why was it The Anſwere ſupra. 
                           Bewayled? If it were vniuſt, why was it Matthaeus ſupra. 
                           not repealed? This is a ſecond ſtraite, either to confeſſe your Anſwere to haue bene inconſiderate, or elſe your Popes Bull to haue runne mad: and ſo it did: for Prou. 17. 15. 
                           To condemne the innocent, and iustifie the vngodly both are abhominable to the Lord.
                        
                        Thirdly, the horned Argument doth againe tume vpon you, thus, Either you Prieſts will take an oath of conſtant obedience, without the Popes arbitrary pleaſure, or you will not; If ſo, then the pretended power Papall indirectly ouer Kings, muſt be directly renounced: If not, then, for me to affirme, that Euery Prieſt Romiſh doth denie the oath of obedience, is no Slander. This is an other ſtraite, and doth conſtraine you to acquit me as no ſlanderer, or elſe to confeſſe your Pope an vſurper.
                        Laſtly, your Pope Pius did Bewaile the proceedings of that Bull, and ſo we verily thinke, but ſo as your Guido Faux immediatly after his apprehenſion, ſorrowed for the proceeding of his ſtratageme, namely, Becauſe it did not proceed. For (as your Interpreter complaineth) Regina, poſtquam Bulla publicata eſt, maioti moleſtia Catholicos affecit Mat. quo ſup.

                           IF the caſe was ſuch betwixt the Popes and deceaſed Princes: yet I cannot conceiue how any equall minded Proteſtant can thinke that the Pope ſo ſtrictly commanding obedience of all Catholikes to his Maieſtie, will or can be ſo contrarie to himſelfe, to publiſh a contrary command againſt a King, offering in publike Parliament to meete with the Romiſh Church, all nouelties taken away, (we wiſh no more) and in the meane time acknowledge the ſame Romane Church to be our Mother. Church, and that his mind was to free vs from perſecution for matters of Conſcience. Of ſuch a King Bellarmine himſelfe, cited againſt vs, will be witneſſe, that he thinketh the Pope cannot proceed againſt him.
                        
                     
                     
                        The Reply.
                        Conceiue but how ſtrictly the Pope hath commaunded obedience; and then you will eaſily vnderſtand how largely you may become trecherous.

                        Secondly, the Popes Bull of obedience is ſo ſtrictly commaunded, as alwaies limited within the crooked hookes of this Parentheſis (Vide infr

                           Pro hac vice, for this

time.) Whereof our Engliſh State hath had too large experience. For to inſiſt onely vpon the preſent: when the oportunitie of ſurprizing the King, Queene, and Prince, was plotted by the Diſciple of Machiauell; then the Pope hath two Prieſts (Watſon and Clearke) to diſſolue that knot of obedience: when after the oportunitie of that Sudden blow, againſt the whole State, had poſſeſſed the malignant; then there is preſently at hand a Prouinciall and his Prieſt ſubordinates to kindle the minds of their Agents, helliſhly to conſume and ſwallow vp both obedience, and all the perſons to be obeyed.
                        That his Maieſtie ſo gratiouſly wiſhed there might be ſome meanes of compounding diſſentions, and an vniuerſall mariage betwixt temporall peace and truth of Religion, proceeded from his moſt Chriſtian heart: teaching rather what you ſhold, then what you will do, who deny to remit any Romiſh ſuperſtition, though it ſauour of meere noueltie. As is apparant in the Oration of Gaſper in the Councel of Trent: where queſtion was concerning the vſe of the Sacrament in both kinds, according to the inſtitution of our Sauiour Chriſt, and the vſe Eccleſiaſticall for a thouſand yeares in Gods Church; did reſolue notwithſtanding, no: but why? Ne erraſſe videamur.
                        
                        His Maieſtie ſaith, All nouelties taken away; you ſay, We wiſh no more. But if you would haue bene correſpondent to his Maieſties wiſh, you ſhould haue anſwered, We wiſh no leſſe. But your modeſtie would neuer yet grant, that there were any nouelties in that Church, where notwithſtanding there is nothing elſe but daily brewing new liquor, hopped with Wormwood.
                        His Maieſtie hath expreſſed his meaning, to call the Romiſh Church our Mother Church; as that Church Romiſh may now call Hieruſalem: but when both mothers will be parricides, to murther their children which ſpeake againſt Idolatrie their ſpirituall adulterie, they may be called mothers in name, in deede monſters.
                        
                           
You cite Bellarmine and omit this his ſentence: Non licet tolerate Regem haereticum conantem pertrahere ſubditos ad ſuam opinionē. At iudicare an Rex pertrahat ſuos ſubditos ad haereſin nec ne, pertinet ad Pontificem. Bellar. lib. 5 de Rom Pont. cap. 7. § Tertia. 
                           It is not lawfull to ſuffer a King who is an Heretike, when he ſhall labour to draw his people to hereſie. To iudge hereof whether he draw his ſubiects to hereſie or no, is the proper office of the Pope. I ſuppoſe there is no Infidell in the world, endued with any opinion of God, but he would labor to draw his ſubiects to his opinion. Now then the cauſe of our King perſiſting to be a Proteſtant is no better then his Predeceſſor; for it is yeelded to the Pope both to iudge who is an Heretike, and when he ſhall ſo iudge, then, according to his Libet to ſend from Rome, comes a Non licet tolerare Regem. Will your modeſtie neuer leaue deluding vs by pretended allegations of Ieſuites? as here to that purpoſe to giue hope of reconciliation, whereas onely by the inſolencie of Ieſuites all ſuch hope is debarred. As is plaine by this forecited Ieſuite: for whereas that moſt graue and learned Caſſander, honored of two Emperors for his ſingular learning and pietie, did teach, that Debent Principes inuenire rationem pacis inter Catholicos, Lutheranos, Caluiniſtas, qui omnes, dum Symbolum tenent Apoſtolicum, vera ſunt membra Eccleſiae, licèt a nobis in particularibus diſſentiant.

                           I anſwere, that the late Lord Treaſurer was thought in his dayes a man not ſecond to manie in politicall wiſedome: And yet he telleth vs in the booke entituled, [The Execution of Engliſh iuſtice,] that many Catholike Priests and Byſhops alſo in this Kingdome, which although they were depriued of their dignities, and alſo impriſoned by Queene Elizabeth; yet are they dignified by that wiſe Councellor, with theſe titles of faithfull and quiet ſubiects, inclined to dutifulneſſe to the Queenes Maieſtie.

                        Nay, that honorable Treaſurer was not ſecond to any in his

time, ſo worthie a Counſellor both for policie and ſound Religion, that you may be thought vnworthie to commend him: whoſe wiſedome as it was moſt excellent, ſo euen in this queſtion will proue as ſufficient to diſplay your fellie. For his moſt commendable Treatiſe, of the Execution of Engliſh iuſtice, did defend the proceedings of the Queenes Maieſtie; whom for the ſame iuſtice your Pope did (if our Lord Treaſurer in his ſingular wiſedome knew iuſtice) vniuſtlie excommunicate. Yet he then commended many graue and learned Biſhops and Clarkes on your ſide for their faithfull ſubiection. What though they then in the Orient of her Maieſties dayes were faithfull? (peraduenture becauſe they then wanted force) yet after, toward the Sunne-ſet of her years were otherwiſe affected. This the Reaſon of that honorable and ſage Counſellor doth ſhew, bringing the examples of the former more moderate Romiſh Clarks by compariſon to condemne the inſolencie of the later brood. This you modeſtly conceale: But father Creſwell will deale plainely, who ſpeaking to the Lord Burleigh (whom for honor ſake I often mention) hath theſe words: Si ſeditionem intelligis (nobiliſſ. D. Theſaurarium alloquitur) de qua Chriſtus, [Non veni pacem in terram mittere, ſed gladium] ſanè intelligis; fateor, Sacerdotes noſtros tibi inobedientes eſſe & ſore ſemper.

This ſaid your Reinolds, intreating of Proteſtant Princes, defining them to be properly Heretikes: whereunto your Ieſuite Gregory de Valentia did aſſent. Whence I, according to the true and infallible lawe of Schooles, conclude, that Romiſh Prieſts would haue all Proteſtant Kings, as Tyrants, cenſured with death. Where is now your iudgement? to make me guilty of that inference, which I noted to be moſt deteſtable in your ſect? King Iames or our late Queene Tyrants? No, but they that ſay ſo be Traytors, who cannot diſcerne betwixt a moſt gratious Prince, and a barbarous Tyrant; but by their monſtrous miſchiefes haue turned extreme clemencie into iuſt extremitie.

                           And it is certaine it ſerueth not to his purpoſe to proue all

Prieſts to intend ſuch things. For firſt, the chiefeſt Priest the Pope had abſolutely forbidden all diſobedience to his Maieſtie by theſe words: Quia Papa iubet, the obedience; and prohibet, the diſobedience: which the chiefe Superior of Prieſts in England in ſpiritual things, as the Arch-prieſt, had receiued and promulged the ſame commaund long ſince in Auguſt laſt. And vpon this firſt notice of this pretended wickedneſſe condemned it by his particular letters, for an intollerable and deſperate fact againſt the order of holy Church, againſt the preſcript of generall Councell, againſt the commaundement of the Pope. Then if the Priests of England will acknowledge the Archprieſt for their Superior at home, or the Pope at Rome, as all both regular and other muſt do: neither all the Prieſts of this nation, nor any one, except diſobedient to his Superior, was guiltie of this Conſpiracie.
                        
                     
                     
                        The Reply.
                        And yet behold your Superior a Ieſuiticall Prieſt is found guiltie of this Conſpiracie, but the frame of your Argument doth infold in it a Sorites, thus: The inferior Prieſts are ſubiect to their Superior the Anchprieſt; this Archprieſt is ſubiect to the (what is there a Chiefe aboue Arch-?) chiefe Prieſt the Pope. But the Pope hath commaunded dutifull ſubiection to the Arch-prieſt, to commaund ſubiection to the inferior Prieſts. Ergo all inferior Prieſts (except they will be diſobedient to their Superior) will be faithfull Subiects. Wherein firſt I do obſerue that in this gradation of your obedience to Kings the higheſt ſtaire is the Pope. But the true Diſciples of Saint Peter did ſoare higher, [Propter Dominum] to God and his word. And in the deſcent the laſt degree you make is a Prieſt: as though you would ſuffer Laymen in a blind zeale, with an intent to aduantage the Catholike cauſe, to practiſe any vile act, and you ſtand to giue ayme: that in the ſucceſſe you may cry, Well ſhot; but when they miſſe, the Actors may periſh, and you cry out: O an vnhappie fact! Otherwiſe by this ſeries cauſarum it muſt as probably follow, that the Pope and Archprieſt, and other inferior Prieſts are guiltie of this vile practiſe, viz. Euery Romiſh Catholike

doth acknowledge a ſpirituall ſubiection to their Prieſts, euery Prieſt to his Superior, the Superior to his Generall the Pope. But many of the moſt deu

                           He will maintaine his ſentence, becauſe Bellarmine ſaith, [Many Popes haue worthily depriued many Princes of their regall authoritie.] The examples be in Leo 3. Fred. 1. in Otho 5. and Childericke King of France: to the which I haue anſwered before; and ſincere dealing would haue alledged the true cauſes, which knowne, proue a flat disparitie in the matter.

                        But Popes (you will ſay) did formerly depoſe Emperors: as though from a caſe de facto, that is, of an act of depoſing, you would conclude a caſe ex iure, that is, inferre a right to depoſe. This would be a welcome plea to malefactors of all kinds, and in this kind not a little preiudice your Popes: becauſe Bellarmine

So we driuing out one naile with another, oppoſe acts to acts, and ſay; But by what right Popes haue vnthronized Emperors let vs know? For we ſhall hereafter ſhew, that they had from God no ſuch authoritie. Where is now your moderation to require of vs acknowledgement of iuſt cauſes of Popes acts, who (you know) proue that no cauſe can iuſtifie ſuch proceedings?

                              entore, and for confirmation call all the world to witneſſe; we ſhall not greatly maruell at this in you, being of the Order of them, who would make that King the Monarch of all the world. How the caſe might ſtand I may be lawfully ignorant, excepting onely, that howſoeuer Sir William Stanley, being no ſubiect to either parties, but

onely a ſubſtitute to the States, and ſubiect to his Queene, from whoſe command he had receiued that charge, he is therin intolerably perfidious: for if the right were doubtfull, then it is a concluſion, which your Ieſuite cannot denie, but that In dubijs Subditus parere debet praefecti ſui mandato; poſſit miles ſuo Regi, Duci, vel Reip. in bello, obedire, vbi dubitat ſitnè Principis bellum, quod aduerſus alterum gerit, iuſtū: in tali dubietate non eſt quod dubitet, Principis mandato eſſe parendum, et hoc modo dubium remouendum. Azorius Ieſ. Iuſt lib. 2. cap. 19. § Nono quaeritur. 
                           When the ſouldiers ſhall doubt whether the warre (and ſo the poſſeſſion he holdeth) which his Prince maketh be lawfull: in all ſuch doubts he ought to obey his Prince, for euen to obey doth remoue the doubt.
                        
                        Secondly, if the caſe were plaine, yet many things are lawfull to be done, which are not lawfull for this man or that man to do: for our Lawe ſaith, A man (as he that ſhall go to his neighbours houſe, and take twenty pound he lent his neighbour) may be hanged for taking his owne: and is there no iuſtice againſt him, who will render vp that which is not his owne? But what his intent was he hath diſcouered to all the world: who, as he then, in violating his Princes repoſe, fled from her ſubiection, ſo in the inuaſion in 88. was bent to returne, not as a good ſubiect, but as a mortall enemie againſt his Soueraigne.
                        Laſtly, for the States in this point, ſuppoſe their getting of Deuentore were vniuſt, yet another Ieſuite (though I ſhould condemne it) would defend their poſſeſſion, who in like caſe thus reſolueth: Quidam ſpecie forte pietatis grauit

                           XIstus Quintus maketh a publike Oratiō in his Conſiſtorie of Cardinals: the ſubiect matter he ſheweth is this: Mortuus eſt Rex Francorum per manus monachi. pag. 3. 
                           The King of France is ſlaine by the hand of a Monke. And what of this? Rarum & memorabile facinus. 
                           This (ſaith he) is a notable, rare, and memorable act. But why? Occidit Monachus regem non pictum aut fictum in Chartâ aut pariete, ſed Regem Francorum in medio exercitus. 
                           Becauſe he ſlue not (ſaith he) a King painted in paper, or grauen in stone, but the King of Fraunce in the middeſt of his hoaſt. Is it a wonder any ſhould wonder that a Monke could murther a mortall King; ſeeing Popiſh hiſtories do record, that Hadrianus Pontifex excō

                           Pope Hadrian being guiltie of the like ſeditious practiſe againſt the Emperor Henry the ſecond, was choaked with a Flie? Nay, but if the Monke had killed a painted Image, that had bene an act farremore memorable, and leſſe intolerable: notwithſtanding no fact is good, becauſe great; but therefore great, becauſe good.

I alledge for the ſame opinion your Engliſh Ieſuite Creſwell, your French Ieſuite De iuſta Abdicatione, your Romiſh Ieſuite Bellarmine, al of the opinion of Bannes, teaching, Then and not before, to take armes, as ſoone as they haue ſtrength. And you anſwer to one onely ſaying: If this be the opinion of Bannes. Is this modeſtie? This opinion (ſay you) is falſe: this is honeſtie: but then are your greateſt Clearkes Blind, and leaders of the blind: as namely, Creſwell, Felinus, Caietan, Tolet, Sà, Alane, Bellarmine, Saire, and the preſent currant of Romiſh Schooles,

                        The Diſcouerie.
                        IN the yeare 1580. when Campion and Parſons came into England, they procured a diſpenſation from the Pope, that al Papiſts in England, notwithſtāding the Excōmunication of the Queen, might profeſſe a large obedience in al tēporal cauſes: but with this addition, (Rebus ſic ſtantibus) i. the caſe thus ſtanding: that is, (as the ſequele did interpret) till you waxe ſtronger. For in the yeare 1588. when the Spaniſh Armado was a ſloate, when by doubling their ſtrength they might preſume the better, then our Countriman Alane doth write an Admonition to the Nobilitie of England, making his booke the Popes Nuncio, to expound his former Parentheſis: In his booke of Admonition.
                            
                           Though the Pope (ſaith he) hath tolerated obedience vnto the Queene in temporall conditions: yet now our holy Father Xiſtus Quintus doth diſcharge all men of their faith and loyaltie vnto her. This is the Popes common guiſe, when he doubteth his faction ſhall be ouermatched, then to inioyne obedience: but it is onely in policie to gaine his ſouldiers a breathing; as Clement the late Pope diſpenſed with the Iriſh for their fidelity to the Queene, till that he had ſome confidence of Tyrones ſucceſſe. For then in the 20. of Ianuarie the yeare 1601. he writ a letter for incouragement: Clemens Octauus. 
                           Fili dilecte, nobilis vir ſalutem, &c. My deare ſonne all health, &c. After he calleth the Rebellion Sacrum foedus, an holy league; promiſing in the way of bleſſing an happy ſucceſſe: Deus pugnabit provobis, conteret inimicos ſuos ante faciem vestram. i. God will fight for you, and tread his enemies vnder your feet. But he (God be thanked) proued a falſe Prophet.

                           I anſwer, that Cardinall Alane, better acquainted with theſe affaires then any Protestant Writer, relateth the Popes declaration

for Catholike obedience to Queene Elizabeth, without any reſtraint or limitation: neither doth this man diſcouer where he findeth any ſuch reſtricting clauſe.
                        
                     
                     
                        The Reply.
                        It ſeemeth you are not acquainted with Cardinall Alane: ſhall he be brought to auerre a Commiſſion of ſubiection without reſtraint of, [Rebus ſic ſtantibus, the caſe ſo ſtanding:] who, Rebus ſic non ſtantibus, Anno 1588 raiſed Engliſh Recuſants againſt the Queene, prouoking them to Supra. fight? I did not indeed diſcouer where I find any ſuch reſtraining clauſe. Here is one onely little clauſe, Rebus ſic ſtantibus, that wanteth the Author; and I muſt be ſuſpected for a coyner: you in all your Anſwers ſcarce alledge the expreſſe ſentence of any one, and yet challenge credit. Such are the times which are fallen vpon vs, and the oddes which by mens wilfull infatuation, you haue obtained. But I muſt produce my Author, for your pleaſure: whō though I perſwade you, yet (a grieuous caſe) will you not be perſwaded. Notwithſtanding hearken to your Father Creſwel, who telleth you that, Quae quidem moderatio id expoſuit, Subditos Anglicanos, non obſtante primo Eccleſiae mandato, Subiectionem obedientiam

                           The caſe of the Earle of Tyrone, whatſoeuer it was, is not now imputed againſt him, as his libertie and fauour in England ſince then be witneſſes: therfore it might be better ſuppreſſed, then vrged by this Diſcouerer.

                        That is, The Earle of Tyrone his offence hath bene pardoned by the King: Ergo, it might better be ſuppreſſed, then that the Pope the patron of his Rebellión, ſhould be diſcouered. None can find fault with the modeſtie of this Anſwer, wherin you ſeeme

to be aſhamed of the Popes bleſſing; and there is hope in the end, you will be aſhamed of your owne anſwer. To the next Reaſon.

                        This Anſwer and my Queſtion differ as much as yeſterday and to morrow: for my argument à ſimili concludeth of an oath concerning a matter to be done, and not of that which is paſt: yet not ſo, as to enforce any to the oath de futuris, but from the denying, or delay thereof to euince a politicall demonſtration of a diſloyall heart. You haue another anſwer no whit more true, though ſomewhat more pertinent.

                           As cōcerning Interrogatories de futuris contingentibus, things which are to come: no creature, man, nor Angell naturally can perceiue them: therefore the examen of ſuch things may be left to God.
                        
                     
                     
                        The Reply.
                        You haue reaſon to refuſe the examination of men, leſt they (vnderſtanding your trechery) might preuent their owne danger: I dare ſay, there is no malefactor in the world bent to any miſchiefe, but he is of your mind. But you are deceiued; the queſtion is not abſolutely de futuris, that is, of things to come, as if your debtor promiſeth to repay you this debt, may he not anſwer he will pay it? The act of payment hath reſpect to the time to come, but the will to pay it, it is an internall and preſent act, and a reſolution of the mind, which no perfect man can be ignorant of in himſelfe. Nemo neſcit ſe velle quod vult: No man can be ignorant of his owne will. And this is that preſent will, which by his outward meſſenger, the tongue, he doth thorow a corporal oath manifeſt to man, what it doth reſolue. Elſe why are leagues betwixt Princes, contracts betweene man and man, conſent of wedlocke, holy vow in Baptiſme to God: are not all theſe viſible acts, ſymbols, and ſignes of inward will? Acts (I ſay) de futuris of things to come, as namely, of fidelitie, loyaltie, ſanctitie hereafter to be performed? Otherwiſe how is it, that you dare conteſt Anſwer cap. 10. § Now.

                           When a Prieſt is conuented before a Iudge, after the oath taken, concerning ſuch queſtions, he may anſwer by the foreſaid Equiuocation: becauſe theſe that aske this oath, are not to be accompted Iudges, but Tyrants. Which point of Equiuocation (ſaith Parſons in his briefe dpolog. fol. 193. 
                           Parſons) is not onely to be allowed by all Diuines, but iudged neceſſarie alſo in ſome caſes for auoiding lying and other inconueniences. This man, we ſee, (as if he would driue out Satan by Satan) teacheth by lying how a man may auoide a lie. This is the generall doctrine of their Sèe Aquinas. Schoole, more then heatheniſh: for among Pagans this was a Decree of Conſcience: Fraus non diſſoluit, ſed diſtringit periurium. Cicero.

                        The practiſe of this deuice of Equiuocation in Prieſts hath bene found to haue bene common of late, by experience of Magiſtrates. It may be thought to haue crept out of Saint Francis ſleeues.

                        If you oppoſe the perſons of theſe Authors, there is (in the opinion of a Ieſuite) no compariſon; if their opinions, there is ſcarce any oppoſition. For their perſons: Tolet was lately a

                           But to recken a moſt reuerend Cardinall (ſpeaking of Baronius) among the Ieſuites, (ſaith a Ieſuite) is as if a fond Astronomer ſhould number Arcturus among the leſſer Starres.

                           For our excuſe in this place and queſtion Catholikes do generally agree, that to equiuocate before a competent Iudge (ſuch as we allow all Magiſtrates in England to be in temporall cauſes in as * Infra in the 3. part. ample manner, as if they were of our Religion, keeping order of lawe) is a mortall ſinne: as it is defined by Thomas, Nauarre, and others.

                           When (ſay they) any is brought before thoſe Magistrates to be examined, they may anſwer by Equiuocation: becauſe they being Tyrants do not examine iuridically. This was then in the dayes of Queene Elizabeth: but now in the raigne of our Soueraigne King Iames, it may be the caſe is different. Nay now alſo hath your Arch▪ prieſt authorized the booke in defence of Equiuocation in behalfe of Catholikes (the words of the title) before a Magiſtrate: ſpeaking profeſſedly of our preſent Engliſh State: and the preſent practiſe both of Prieſts and their Diſciples is (alas!) ſo ordinarie, that the daily experience of their equiuocating lying is readie for this your anſwer to giue you the lye. I will not trouble my memorie with multitude of examples, which diuers Magiſtrates haue reported: I will onely be contented with two, proued the laſt day in the Arraignment of Garnet the Ieſuite your Superior.
                        Garnet: He (as before almoſt al the Honorable of our State was proued) had by manifold proteſtations and execrations denyed before the Lord Chiefe Iustice, and his Maieſties Atturney Generall, that he had conferred with his fellow Hall ſince their coming into priſon: by and by was witneſſe produced, who heard their conference, and related the very words ſo directly, that both Garnet and Hall did confeſſe, they indeed had had conference together. What was his excuſe now for his firſt Anſwer? He did equiuocate, (his owne words at the Barie) becauſe he was not bound to accuſe himſelfe, before he ſaw witneſſe to conuince him. An anſwer wretched and witleſſe; wretched (I ſay) becauſe to vſe equiuocation in a religious execration, is execrable wickedneſſe: witleſſe, becauſe to defend a denyall of truth, till one be conuicted of a lie, is to profeſſe a

defence of an vntruth, till he be not able to defend it.
                        The ſecond example is in your Diſciple M. Treſham, who vpon his death-bed, moued by a ſiniſter ſpirit of a woman to retract his former true confeſſions, wherin Garnet was brought in ſuſpition of the laſt treaſon, (leaſt the guilt of ſuch a Prieſt, might be preiudiciall to the Catholike cauſe) did before the formerly named Magiſtrates at the point of death recall his foreſayd confeſſion thriſe with proteſtation: 
                              Ʋpon my ſaluation (ſaith he) I was not acquainted with Garnet this many years. After his death is Garnet apprehended, and examined of that point of acquaintance with Treſham, who did vnder his hand writing confeſſe both the times and places of their conuerſing together: al this Garnet did acknowledge at the Barre. Then the right Honorable the Earle of Saliſburie, (whoſe rare wiſedome did in that vmuerſall audience proue it ſelfe often the only racke to that Ieſuite, in extracting many truths from that Equiuocator to his often publike confuſion) aſked him: What iudge you, M. Garnet of that falſe proteſtation of M, Treſham he made vpon his ſaluation? Garnet ſmiling, anſwered. I thinke he did equiuocate. Smiling, a thouſand beheld him. A very ridiculous anſwer indeed, if it had not bene horribly impious, which therefore the whole audience, as children of truth, did then by a common murmure openly deteſt.
                        To conclude, I muſt now (my moderate Anſwerer) neceſſarily racke you: but (feare not) onely by that Logicall inſtrument, which is therefore called 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           : thus: you would perſwade vs that Prieſts thinke our Proteſtant Magiſtrates competent, before whom you may not vſe Equiuocation: your Superior, by whome (if you be a Ieſuite) this your booke was priuiledged, did both by practiſe and poſition more then allow the vſe of Equiuocation the laſt day, euen in a moſt honorable preſence. Now therefore if your booke was not priuiledged by Garnet, then this inſcription of your booke, Anſwer in the front of the book. 
                           [With licence of Superior] is vntrue: if you ſay he did priuiledge it, then this excuſe for all your Prieſts, ſaying: [We allow Magiſtrates in England co
                                 •
                               petent, before whome we may not equiuocate,] (Garnet gaine▪ ſaying it) is likewiſe vntrue.
                        
                           
The greateſt difficultie now will be, to tell whether of you two be the Superior in lying: you in ſaying, You do not defend that, which you do ſo manifeſtly defend, a flat lye; or he, who defendeth that, which no man can euer defend, Equiuocation, the very damme of all damnable lying. Whereof more at large in the Confutation.
                        Yet behold a greater myſterie of this iniquitie, then hath bene yet reuealed: Treſham taketh it on his ſaluation, that, to his knowledge, no Prieſt was acquainted with the plot, Digby and others make the like proteſtations at their death: Garnet a Prieſt did deny with maine and many proteſtations, that he had conference with Hall, and defended it lawfull, till he was conuicted by witneſſe. To what end? leſt that Prieſts guiltineſſe might make their prieſtly function and Religion more odious. Whence I may conclude, that it were more then ſottiſhneſſe for any Proteſtant to beleeue the Prieſts proteſting their innocencie (as Garnet did) at the Barre, or their diſciples proteſting (as Treſham and Digby did) the innocencie of Prieſts and their adherents at their death: I ſay, all their witneſſes deſerue no credite, who defend thus to equiuocate, till they be euidently conuicted by witneſſe.

                        THat though they take an oath of allegeance in caſes temporall, yet their common interpretation is ſtill with reſpect of their more ſupreme head. See before Reaſon 4. lit. c. 
                           During the will of the Pope, who (ſay they) hath power to free both himſelf and others from the bond of an oath.

                           The caſe is ſo to be interpreted, namely, except the Pope ſhall releaſe him from his oath: becauſe in euery oath the authoritie of a Superior muſt be excepted.

                        There muſt be ſome exception of an oath, which is this, In male promiſſis reſcinde fidem: that is: A wicked vow is well broken. But your Popiſh exception for two reſpects we iuſtly think intolerable; this will be plaine by this example: If now the Spaniſh, in his league vpon expreſſe conditions with the Engliſh, would, for the performance of his oath, depend vpon the Popes arbitrement, which is, [Till you can find oportunitie for a miſchiefe,] then ſilly Engliſh are in no better caſe then a gooſe tyed with a line by the legge to a foxe tayle, which doth appeare in the Diſcouerie following.

                     We haue alſo alledged the reſolution of the Ieſuites Colledge of the Vniuerſitie of Salamancha in Spaine, Anno Dom. 1602. As likewiſe Creſwell his Philopater, printed at Rome, Licentiâ Superiorum, by the licence of the Superiors; ſignifying the Ieſuites there. What ſhall I need to mention Reinolds (in his Roſtus) a Doctor of Diuinitie, and chiefeſt man in the Engliſh Seminarie at Rhemes? Father Parſons (in his Dolman) a principall Rector in the Seminarie at Rome? Seeing all theſe be Seminaries, you may trie the young plants by their fruites. If any deſire further experience in this kind, he may conſult with Carolus Molinaeus, and Pontus Tyardaus, both Pariſiens, and but euen now, before I can reade them, to be read of all men.
                     
                        The Confirmation.
                        It will not be denyed of any Prieſt, but that in theſe Popiſh Seminaries he hath vowed obedience to his generall Fathers in thoſe ſchooles: and it is as notorious, that all Generals are abſolutely enthralled to their chiefe Generall the Pope; all of them as hands and feet to worke and walke, as that their head ſhall deuiſe. Which (as we haue heard in Gregorie the 7. Gregorie the 9. Pius Quint us, and others) haue abſolued Subiects

from all obedience, and charged them to take armes against their Emperours, Kings and Queenes excommunicate, &c. Shall we now imagine, the old Foxes being ſuch, that their cubbes can degenerate? If euer any of that kind gaue hope vnto vs, it was the ſecular Prieſts; who for a fit did write many things very truly againſt Ieſuiticall rebellious Practiſes: but after, perceiuing the Recuſants to withdraw their beneuolence, as rather deuoted to the Ieſuites, and that the Pope alſo tooke part againſt them, they, ſearing their conſciences, wholly ſubmitted themſelues vnto the Arch-prieſt, whoſe commaund vpon occaſion is countermaunded by the faction Ieſuiticall. So that now we may aſwel expect grapes from thorns, or a white Aethiopian, as loyall ſubiection from this Religion.

                        Nay, it is a different and demonſtratiue Reaſon, taken from the formall cauſe of conſpiracie and conſent in ſuch practiſes, becauſe Doctors and Diſciples with you, are more then Relatiues: for what can moſt of your Prieſts ſay here, but as Schoolboyes, Dictata Magiſtri; and as Infants, who receiue no more food, then that which they ſucke from their nurces. A matter notorious: and how (I pray you) may we better, then by the doctrine of your Generals, know what is your generall doctrine?

                           Theſe Aſſertions are most falſely obiected, for the Scholers do not vow any obedience to their Superiors; and that obedience which they follow, is in obſeruing the Collegiall Rules.

                           K. Henrie the eight did illegitimate his two daughters M. and E. and after declared the contrary, making them legitimate by ſtatute. I haue inquired into the Acts which are extant, and I find three Acts, whereby the aforeſaid daughters were diſabled, as namely in annis 25. 28. 33. of King Henrie his raigne.

                           This is aagainst the ſundry Acts of Parliament remaining yet in force, confirmed by the King of famous memory Henrie the eight, againſt the letters patents of our late Soueraigne King Edward the ſixt, and his great ſeale, againſt the conſent of the moſt part of the noble Vniuerſities of Chriſtendome, &c. Wherefore you, that tell vs of a ſtatute of Legitimation, as a matter euident, in modeſtie ſhold not haue concealed your euidence. Otherwiſe you know in a propoſition copulatiue, if but one point be true, the whole is a lie.
                        Say then, whereof can you accuſe Cranmer, Ridley, and all Proteſtants, wherein you will not make King Henrie the eight, King Edward the ſixt, and many Parliaments guiltie? I did neuer heare the whole ſtate of any kingdome termed Traitors but by your boldneſſe: If you had ſtrooke at the head of that oppoſition, you ſhould not haue needed to haue lopped the branches: for if King Henry might haue ſpoken from the dead in the day of the ſucceſſion of Queene Mary, he would haue pleaded the cauſe of the oppoſites, as Dauid did in the behalfe of his people, Oues hae, &c. It is I: theſe other what haue they done? Notwithſtanding we acknowledge her ſucceſſiō iuſt: and after the proclamation of her title, ſhew vs what Proteſtant euer reſiſted? what Miniſter of the Goſpel in all that fierie trial did kindle the leaſt ſparke of ſedition among her people? Was it becauſe they wanted hope of ſucceſſion? Behold there was the hand-maide of God, Elizabeth their hopefull ſucceſſor to the Crowne. Was it for want of power? why death is rightly deſcribed to be a Giant, hauing a thouſand hands, able to giue any liuing creature his mortall wound. But I abhorre to diſcourſe of theſe rebellious conceits. Laſtly, of all Proteſtants which were burned in Queene Maries dayes for Religion, name but one that was accuſed of treaſon; I require inſtance but in one: an apparant demonſtration, that their Religion taught them loyall ſubiection.

Though therefore it is requiſite that that which is lawfull, be performed by lawfull proceedings; yet if intent (the ſubiect of this diſpute) might anſwer for Proteſtants accuſed in that name, then is it plaine, that it was not Religion: if for Wyat and his fellowes, it is as plaine it was not againſt the Queene or State, but for both, that the whole land might continue in their former ſubiection, and that by Spaniſh inſolencie, her Highneſſe preheminence and ſoueraignetie might not be impared.

                        It will be requiſite, without preiudice to the moſt learned and

religious iudgement of his Maieſtie, to ſatisfie for two places related from that conference. The firſt place touching the act of the midwiues of Egypt, who mercifully ſpared the liues of the infants of the Hebrewes, notwithſtanding the commaundement of the King. The note: [Their diſobedience herein was lawfull, but their diſſembling was euill:] And was not this diſobedience lawfull? Let vs conſult with the holy Ghoſt, Heb. 11. 23. where it is written [By faith Moſes when he was borne was hid three moneths of his parents, neither feared they the Kings commaundement.] The ſame is the caſe of the [midwiues diſobeying the commaundement of the King.] Now that which is noted by the Spirit of God, as commendable in the parents of Moſes, may it be condemnable in theſe mercifull midwiues of the Egyptians? Nay, for it is alſo written, [Exod. 1. 15. & 20. 
                           The midwiues of Aegypt feared God, and did not as the King commanded them, but preſerued aliue the male children, and therefore God proſpered them.] But we muſt diſcerne in this act two colours, white and blacke, which S. Auguſtine diſtinguiſheth: In vi

Now that Commentarie doth not defend depoſing a King, neither poſſibly can it be defended by any ordinarie commaund of God in all Scripture: which is Infra. proued. Wherefore ſuppoſing that the Relation of the Conference be direct, yet may you not thinke that his Maieſtie (whoſe iudgement is ſo diuinely illuminated by the light of the word of God, that he neuer refuſed Conference with the greateſt Ieſuite or Doctor Romiſh) could take exception to the note, as from an offence thereby giuen, but onely in ſuſpition, an offence taken by weake ones prepoſſeſſed with your Romiſh maladie, whereof you haue giuen vs experience in your many controuerſies.

                           If I had trauelled no further into that doctrine, then to the

late printed booke, by your Maieſties Printer of the late intended Conspiracie, I might eaſily performe a iuſt defence: for the Proteſtant Author giueth it out as a generall rule, and vndoubted Maxime to all Profeſſors of worſhip to take armes, if their Religion be in hazard: and that no priuate man ſhould thinke his life more happie then to fight pro Aris. Which is greater libertie then our Aduerſarie can find in Catholike Writers, ſo of him attached of Treaſon and Rebellion.

                        This ſhoot is but twelue ſcore wide of the marke you ayme at: your bent is to defend them, who profeſſe it lawfull for Catholikes in the maintenance of Religion to murther Kings, and harrow Kingdomes (in their opinion) hereticall. This Author teacheth vs to Fight (his owne words) pro Aris, pro focis, pro Patre patriae: his Reaſon, Becauſe the indangering of one of theſe would at once ſtirre the whole bodie of a Commonwealth, not any more as diuided members, but as a ſolid and indiuiduall lumpe. What is then the difference? he in the whole Treatiſe, teacheth euery priuate man to arme himſelfe by all poſſible meanes, but firſt armed with authoritie of the King and State. You teach to fight for Religion (violating the obedience of God) againſt your King and kingdome, to deſtroy them. The difference may be illuſtrated by the like: A priuate man, if without authoritie temporall he kill a murtherer, he is a murtherer; but authorized by the publike lawe, he is now no more priuate, but an Officer, but the lawles homicide doth beſt pattern your lawleſſe parricide. So that there is no more oddes betweene our and your Authors opinion, then cum Rege, & contra Regem: to fight with, and againſt the King. You can find no more exception in England, whither will you now? it is but a ſtep to Scotland, what ſee you there?

But Beza, as he ſucceeded Caluine a Doctor, ſo in doctrine likewiſe. Heare Bezas owne confeſſion, and it will proue him innocent, you a ſlaunderer, and your Popes the capitall delinquents in this kind.

                           Priuate men, among whom I account inferior

Magiſtrates (in reſpect of their King) haue no other remedie againſt Tyrants, to whom they be ſubiect, then amendment of their liues, prayers, and teares, which God in his good time will not deſpiſe. They alwaies prouided not to do, but onely to ſuffer euil, as Chriſt by his owne example hath taught vs. And if it ſhall ſo happen that we cannot obey the commaund of the King, but that we muſt offend God, the King of Kings: then muſt we rather obey God then man. But how? ſo, as likewiſe to remember, that it is one thing not to obey, another thing to reſiſt and betake our ſelues to armes. This kind of violent diſobedience we may not vſe. Can any moderate ſpirit call this doctrine rebellious?
                        
                        Secondly: Your ſlaunder. Quid de Subiectorum erga ſuos magiſtratus officio ſentiamus, ex his cognoſci poteſt certiùs ac veriùs, quàm ex corum calumnijs, quibus nullus eſt pudor nos inuoluere cum vertiginoſis Anabaptiſtis, qui magiſtatuum authoritatem tollunt, iuriſiurandi religionem euertunt, indicia & B

                           What our opinion is concerning ſubiection vnto Magiſtrates, (ſaith Beza) a man may better be instructed by our writings, then by the ſlaunders of ſuch as number vs among the companie of intoxicate Anabaptiſts, who renounce the authoritie of Magiſtrates: which doctrine how much we abhorre, none can be ignorant, which doth not obstinately refuſe to ſee the light. Of which kind you muſt needes be, ſeeing you had rather beleeue any libels againſt Beza, then ſee his owne writings.
                        Thirdly, your Popes capitall Offendors, Auget etiam illud aduerſariorum noſtrorum impudentia, quòd cùm ipſi palam contra Dei Verbum Reges & Regna ſibi ſubiecerint, nec vllum ſit hominum genus aduerſus magiſtratus magis rebelle, audent tamen illi nobis illud ipſum ſcelus impingere, quod ſibi licere non obſcutè iactant. Beza ibidem.
                            
                           The impudencie of our Accuſers (ſaith Beza) herein is moſt notorious; that they, who contrarie to the word of God haue openly ſubiected Kings and Kingdomes to their authoritie, being themſelues the moſt rebellious Sect vnder heauen in contemning Magiſtrates; dare notwithſtanding obiect the guilt of that crime vnto vs, which they thinke to be a vertue in themſelues, and wherein they glorie and vaunt. Which is moſt true, as we haue proued out of your Bellarmine and others, glorying in the acts of ſuch Popes, who haue depoſed Emperors.

                           Falſe witneſſes were brought against (Proteſtants) them of the Religion, affirming that in a place at Maubert, at a Councellors houſe, great numbers of them had eaten a pigge inſtead of a paſcall Lambe before Eaſter; and after, the candles being put out, euery man tooke his woman, and had his pleaſure of her. The Cardinall vpon theſe informations moued the Court, the Queene mother tooke occaſion hereby to reuile ſome of her Gentlewomen, who were of the Religion: but they deſired and obtained means that the principall witneſſes might be examined: it was done, two young boyes come foorth, and affirme that then and many other times they had had the vſe of your Councellors daughters: but in the end the witneſſes began to ſtagger, and couertly to denie it. The Councellor (ſought after for his Religion) vnderſtanding this ſhameful ſlander, went with his wife and his two daughters, yeelding himſelfe priſoner for his Religion, deſiring that the cauſe of his daughters might be examined. They were diligently ſearched by Phyſitions and women, and found to be virgins: and the young men did thus iustifie themſelues that they did it in deuotion, being perſwaded that ſuch an accuſation againſt ſuch Heretikes was good, whether it were true or falſe. But the virgins were cleared, and yet their father remained in priſon, and the witneſſes were not puniſhed.

                           The Guizes (who were no naturall Frenchmen) not able to accuſe the Prince of Condie of Treaſon, (Daniels caſe) called him in queſtion to be condemned of hereſie for his Religion. But what was the right cauſe of tumults? Pag. 62. & 67. 
                           There was deliuered an exact declaration to proue, that thoſe of the Guizes had decreed to put all the Princes of the bloud Royall to death, as ſoone as they had cut off them of the Religion; and they were euidently proued to be guiltie of his treaſon. 
                           Pag. 83. 
                           And the King could not otherwiſe iudge, but that great wrong was offered to his bloud. Then not the Proteſtants, but the Spaniſh faction of the Guizes were guiltie of thoſe broyles in the daies of King Francis. Notwithſtanding Pag. 85. 86. 87. 
                           Though the Prince of Condie did acquit himſelfe of Treaſon, and boldly ſtood to his Religion, yet not long after they pronounced iudgment of death vpon him: But King Francis fell extremely ſicke, and in his ſickneſſe made a ſolemne vow to all Saints in Pieardie,

that if it pleaſed them to help him, he wold wholy purge his Realme of (meaning Proteſtants) all thoſe heretikes. And thus all Proteſtants were freed then from this deſigne: the Saints of Piccardie belike were of your mind, Proteſtants are no heretikes.

                        It is not vnlikely but an hundred thouſand were ſlaine; but it is as probable that a thouſand for an hundred of them were Proteſtants perſecuted for their Religion, who alwayes lay open to Popiſh trecheries, as is plaine by the barbarous maſſacre, wherein (as teſtifieth your owne

                        What? abſolutely depriued of all authoritie? Proue this, and I will as abſolutely denie all his doctrinall authoritie: whom, by reading of your moſt learned Ieſuites, as Maldonate, Ribera, Pererius, Salmeron, Tollet, and ſuch others, and conferring their expoſitions with Caluins, I dare boldly affirme him, to be of that excellēt iudgment, that theſe your greateſt Rabbies (for their beſt expoſitions) light their candles at Caluins to arch. But to the point. Caluin doth conſider in the perſon of a wicked King two ſituations, one as he ſitteth vnder God, the other when he exalteth himſelfe to ſit aboue God: when he commandeth as a ſubſtitute and ſubordinate, God hath commanded vs to obey man: but when he commandeth contra Deum, against God (ſaith * Caluine) he vſurpeth Gods throne, and herein he looſeth his royaltie, which is to be obeyed. A matter ſo reaſonable, that in the behalf of God, the A poſtles in like caſe are content to appeale herein to the iudgement of his aduerſary, man, [Act. 4. 19. 
                           Whether it be better to obey God or man, iudge you.] To explane this by example: If a Iuſtice of peace ſhall command me to kill a fellon, I denie his authoritie, this is againſt the commiſſion of his and my King, and in this caſe of too peremptorie a commaund I acknowledge him no Iuſtice, yet not abſolutely no Iuſtice: for if preſently he ſhall commaund me to apprehend the ſame fellon, I willingly obey him. He therefore in his former commaund was as it were disjuſticed onely by that act of diſobedience; wherein obedience to him had bene diſobedience againſt the Crowne: but yet he remained Iuſtice in office, and therefore comanding iuſtly, I dutifully obeyed him. Thus is it in Caluins iudgement, in the compariſon betweene man and God: If the King exalt himſelfe to Gods throne, then pull him downe, that is, do not obey, yet ſo, that we diſpoſſeſſe

him not of his owne throne, which is Gods footſtoole. Therefore, ſaid Caluine,

                           In the moſt wicked King, that is enemie to God; there is by Gods ordinance an impreſſion of maieſtie, which is inuiolable, and his authoritie is not to be contemned. This is cleare in Daniels caſe, wherein Caluin doth inſiſt: for Daniel commaunded by the King to worſhip the Idoll, refuſed; & caſt among Lions, was miraculouſly preſerued, & in the end deliuered: then he thus anſwered the King, Dan. 6.

The next word of [rather ſpitting in their faces,] ſpoken comparatiuely, doth not rebelliouſly teach irreuerence to the maieſtie of a King, but only emphatically, inforce a more zealous obedience vnto God: as whē I ſay, I had rather burne my hand, then write any thing againſt my conſcience; I do not danger my hand, but I auouch the ſinceritie of my conſcience. Notwithſtanding if the word had bin vſed ſimply, yet could it not haue bin vnderſtood literally, but figuratiuely. As when it is written of God, that Apoc. 3. 16. 
                           God will ſpue the luke-warme profeſſor out of his mouth: ſignifying he doth loath ſuch. Therefore you muſt not deale with mens ſpeeches, as Salomon teacheth men not to deale with their owne noſes: Prou. 30. 33. 
                           He that wringeth his noſe too much, doth fetch bloud.

                        The Reply.
                        The Storie is long▪ but the ſumme is ſhort: that the whole State of Sueueland required that according to the former Parliament of their Kingdome, the King ſhould ſweare to defend them in their former liberties, and especially the fruition of the Religion then profeſſed. Doth your Proteſtant witneſſe call them Rebellious Goſpellers? It was the demaund of an whole State for defence of their countrie priuiledge; can any Papiſt call this rebellious? You will be as loth to confeſſe this, as you are prone to forge the other. Let vs trauell homeward againe, and end there where you began.

                           MArtin Luther the prime Proteſtant of that time ſaid, he cared not for Kings, & ſo careles he is in this caſe, that he telleth, that it is the nature of the Goſpel to raiſe wars & ſeditions: that among Chriſtians there is no Magistrate, no Superior, that it is a thing to be obtained by prayers, that countrimen obey not their Princes; No lawe, or ſyllable of lawe can be impoſed vpon Chriſtians

neither by men or Angels; there is no hope of remedie, except all humane lawes be taken away.
                        
                     
                     
                        The Reply.
                        Here is your common Linſi-woolſie, mixture of truth and falſhood: but as you would haue vs to confeſſe a truth, ſo be you willing to acknowledge your Error.
                        The truth. Luther profeſſed that he did not care for Kings: true, but in that comparatiue ſence, which he had learned of our Lord Chriſt. Luk. 21. 12. 
                           You ſhall be called before Kings and Rulers for my name ſake: but feare not man, who can kill the bodie, but feare God, who is able, after the bodie is dead, to take the ſoule, and caſt it into hell fire, I ſay, feare him. Secondly, Luther telleth that it is the nature of the Goſpell to raiſe warres and ſeditions. And doth not the Goſpell it ſelfe tell vs the ſame likewiſe? Matth. 10. 34. 
                           Behold, I came not to ſend peace into the world, for I will ſet the father againſt the ſonne, and the daughter against the mother, &c. You cannot be ignorant of the difference of a cauſe and an occaſion, a thing conſidered properly in his owne nature, and vnproperly by externall accident. An nos frangimusianuam, cum effractoribas ſuribus, quia, ſi non cā clauderemus, illi non frangerant? Auguſt. lib. de m

                           Do I (ſhutting the doore) breake it, becauſe the theefe would not haue broken it except it had bene ſhut, ſaith Saint Auguſtine. So Luther: Becauſe the Goſpell is preached, the profeſſors thereof are perſecuted with the ſword; is therefore the innocent profeſſor cauſe of the perſecution? no, but onely an occaſion. Chriſt, who is in his owne nature * Petra ſalutis, a rocke of ſaluation to the elect; to the reprobate is called a 1. Pet. 2. 8. 
                           Stone of offence: becauſe the godly are by faith edified to life, and the wicked by the malice of their hart do ſpurne againſt Chriſt, ſtumble, and periſh through vnbeleefe. The Goſpell likewiſe hath a double ſauor, vitall and mortall; being 2. Cor. 2. 16. 
                           The ſauor of life vnto life to the ſanctified by Gods ſpirit, and the ſauor of death vnto death to the irrepentant and vnregenerate. So then the Goſpell is no otherwiſe ſeditious then the ſweet flower is venimous; frō this the Spider ſucketh ſweetneſſe, but through the fierie malignitie changeth it to peyſon: ſo that obſtinate hearing of grace, peace,

and ſaluation, by his naturall malice reſiſteth grace with contempt, peace with warre, and eternall ſaluation, by working bodily deſtruction.
                        The falſhood: to affirme, that Luther did abandon all Magiſtracie, and abhorre all humane lawes, is firſt falſe: for then I ſhould maruell in what commonwealth the doctrine of Luther could

                        You being in your ſelfe Magnus opinator, told vs of the opinion of Luther, and now deſcended to Munſter, ſay, Munſter was of the ſame opinion, (viz. with Luther) and called, &c. But your Peter Frarer, whom you brought to accuſe Caluin, is herein readie to iuſtifie Luther, ſaying, that P

                           Luther wrote againſt theſe rebellious ones, prouing that it belonged to all Christians to perſecute them to death. Caluin alſo wrote a booke, intituled, * Aduerſus Libertinos: againſt fantaſticall and Anabaptiſticall Libertines: and Beza, as we haue heard, ſaith, Supra. 
                           That it is impious wickedneſſe for any to obiect vnto Proteſtants the opinion of thoſe rebellious Anabaptiſts, and ſpirits of giddineſſe. But what thinke you? were Anabaptiſts Proteſtants? or were Proteſtants whom you haue named, of this opinion of Anabaptiſts? Thus would you perſwade your Engliſh Reader; but your Cardinal, & Reader at Rome doth confute you, Poteſtatem politicam eſſe apud Chriſtianos illicitam, eſt opinio Anabaptiſtarum: quam non ſolùm Catholici omnes execrantur, ſed etiam Philippus Melancthon, Caluinus, Lutherus in viſitatione Saxonica inſtiſſ

For as well may you call the Bandites, namely thoſe grand theeues and out-lawes in Italy of the ſame incorporation with the citizens of Rome, as name Anabaptiſts who depend vpon extraordinary and fantaſticall reuelations of the ſame opinion with Proteſtants, who are wholy directed by the expreſſe written law and Goſpell of Chriſt.
                        I perceiue you are now growne weary with long trauell, I could haue wiſhed you would haue viſited Polonia, and after that Bohemia in ſome particular obſeruations: for in both thoſe kingdomes there hath bin long time manifold vexations executed vpon Proteſtants, and yet neuer any of them or others can be named, who depoſed Princes, inuaded Crownes, or by any treaſon did practiſe the deaths of their Soueraignes. Now therefore let your moderation be admoniſhed to returne home into England: and ſeeing you cannot find Proteſtants for your fellowſhip in your kind of rebellion, now let Proteſtants (I pray you) haue your fellowſhip in faithful ſubiection. But lingua, quo vadis?

                           But to ſpeake vnto this Obiector concerning Protestants proceedings in aquiuocating: Luther vſed it at his pleaſure, now appealing to the Pope, and after renouncing his authoritie. Cranmer did often recant his errors by othes, and again oftē defend them; counter fetted the hands of fiftie Conuocation men (Fox himſelfe being iudge) to giue alying credit to his falſe cauſe, but excuſed his falſe oaths by equiuocation. Protestants of England in the dayes of K. Henrie the eight, King Edward the ſixt, and Queene Elizabeth, did equiuocate. Such was the proceeding of P. Martyr and Bucer, two great Profeſſors of Diuinitie in Oxford and Cambridge. Such was the Proteſtant adherents the Dukes of Northumberland and Suffalke, and now the ordinary vſe of Puritanes.
                        
                     
                     
                        The Reply.
                        Luther, Cranmer and others, as they were perſwaded that the Biſhop of Rome was a faithfull Biſhop, did ſweare obedience vnto him; but afterwards being better illuminated, did renounce him, as Antichriſtian. But if all recantation ſhall be thus cenſured, then might you teach S. Auguſtine to retract his retractations. But we wil not denie their infirmities, for it hath pleaſed God to note the like in his choſen Saints in holy writ, to the amplifying of the glory of his grace in their repentance and his pardon. Yet was not there in theſe acts any equiuocation, no more then in the acts of Peter, who, at the cock-crow, went out Math. 26. 75▪
                            
                           of the high Prieſts hall and wept bitterly. Thus Cranmerawaked by the call of the ſpirit of God, executed vengeance vpon that hand which ſubſcribed vnto your idolatrous ſeruice, Fox Act. Mon. 
                           Burned it in the fire. Then whatſoeuer his diſſimulatiō was, he thought it worthy of repentance, not as you do think your equiuocation worthy of defence: whereas in the truth of Chriſtianitie, there is the ſame puniſhment due to your equiuocating tongues which he executed vpon his diſſembling hand. O but Fox is witneſſe that he defended himſelfe by ſaying

he did equiuocate. I am ſure you would not haue bene indebted vnto vs for the words if they had bene extant: I found the place of M. Actes & Monuments, anno 1596 pag. 1309. Fox, but no mention of equiuocation. A monſter not hatched in thoſe times. That which was obiected by Doctor Weſton, is there ſatisfied by M. Cranmer: but you are more rigorous then auncient Aduerſaries.
                        Yet further would I demand, why Proteſtants, turning from Papacie in the daies of King Edward, muſt be condemned for ſuch as haue equiuocated: and Papiſts reuolting from Proteſtants in the raigne of Queene Mary, muſt be thought to haue bene innocents?

                           Aequiuocating was practiſed by Caluine, as the Lord of Canterbury, and Beza, and others record.

                        I reported this your accuſation to my Lord of Canterbury, and his Grace anſwered, that you had wronged his teſtimony: for I am ſure (ſaid his Grace) that this myſtery in thoſe times was not ſet abroach. We alſo examined the book you alledge, and find not one ſyllable for your purpoſe. But what can we expect from you, Patrons of lying equiuocation, but in your accuſations againſt Proteſtants equiuocating lies?

                           Luther was ſo vile in this kind of equiuocating, that neuer pillory mate behaued himſelfe ſo as he did. Cogging, lying, equiuocating, diſſembling was practiſed by Caluine, who was baniſhed for a diſſembling ſeducer. Cranmer periured himſelfe, and excuſed it by equiuocation.

                        In theſe your lying ſlanders, you giue vs good hope that you

will leaue your equiuocating lies, becauſe, as though you deteſted the impietie thereof, you vilifie it with theſe termes, vile equiuocating, adiudging it worthy the pillory, matching it with cogging, lying, ſeducing, periury. This is yet very wel. But we find that true which the Orator ſaith, Natura ſuilena: Euery man naturally is a band vnto himſelfe. Now you examining your Glycerie equiuocation in your aduerſaries, Luther, Cranmer, Caluine, O then it is vile, cogging, lying, ſeducing, &c. But beholding her in your owne embracements, ſo Anſvver ibid, § Secondly.
                            
                           In equiuocating there is nolie nor ſinne. Adulterous Iudah iudging of Thamar, whom he had vnknowingly knowne, hearing that ſhe was brought in for an adultereſſe, gaue preſently ſentence, Gen. 38. 24. 
                           Let her be burned: but when by certaine euidences and pledges ſhe made it knowne vnto him, that if ſhe were the woman, he was the mā; then he confeſſeth, She is more righteous then I. There was ſome modeſtie in this, but what moderation do you vſe to adiudge equiuocation (which you faſ

                           2. The impious conceit of Aequiuocation.

                        This is ſo contrary to the Story in holy writ, that by the examples of Kings in ordering (though neuer in ordeining) of Prieſts, the Ieſuits are inforced to allow that the King was ſupreme ouer the Prieſt. Their reaſons: Dicunt, Proteſtantes, Reges in veteri Teſtamento praeſcripſiſſe Sacerdotibus quae in rebus ſacris gerere debebant, & etiam negligentes Sacerdotes à miniſterio abdicaſſe: reſpondotur, mirum eſſe hoc non debere, quia ſynagoga Iud

                           The Temporall ſtate exceeded the Spirituall in the olde Law, as much as the Subſtantiue is more excellent than the Adiectiue. In both theſe we diſlike their compariſon, and accept their concluſion, which is this: In the Old Teſtament the Kings authority was aboue the Prieſts. And therefore they can not prooue the▪ ſouerainty of the Pope ouer Kings by the ſtate of the Olde Teſtament. Albeit this is infallible, yet are not the Romiſh aſhamed to argue from thence both by typicall Analogy, and by examples.

                           King and Prieſt was ſhadowed by the types of the Olde Teſtament: but in Chriſt, his kingdome had the preheminence of Prieſthood, becauſe he is Prieſt only for vs, but he is King ouer vs: ſecondly, as Prieſt he is ſuppliant to the Father; as King he is predominant ouer all powers and principalities equally with the Father.

                        The Anſwer to two other examples.
                        Secondly we diſpute of lawfull examples of depoſing kings: but behold your 1 2. Sam. 1. ver. 8 & 15. 
                           Saul was killed of an Amalachite, whō therfore Dauid commanded to be ſlaine. Your 12 2. Reg. 21. 
                           Ammon alſo was ſlaine of his owne ſeruants, who were therefore purſued and ſlaine of the people, becauſe of th

                              ir conſpiracie againſt the king. Thus your 1. and 12. examples which you propound

for your imitation rather ſhew what you would, then what you ſhould be, yet ſo it is, that wicked acts are the beſt examples you can alledge to proportionate your godleſſe concluſions.
                     
                     
                        The Anſwer to fiue other examples.
                        Thirdly, extraordinarie acts can be no preſidents for ordinary or generall axioms: Sed quae haec (bone Deus!) conſequentia eſt? Propheta pronunciauit contra Ieroboam iudicium diuinum. Ergo Eccleſia habet ius in Reges. Nihil inſcitius: nihil enim ad Prophetam, nam Prophetae multi nulla poteſtate Sacerdotali praediti fuerunt. Deinde Prophetarum munus in denunciatione iudiciorum Dei extraordinaria fuit: quae ad probandam ordinationem nullà conſecutionis neceſſitate valeat. Barclaius ibid.
                            
                           But (your ſelues cannot deny) many of your examples were ſpecially priuiledged functions by Prophets and others extraordinarily and immediately from God appointed to thoſe offices: and therefore cannot inferre any ordinarie power of altering States and kingdomes. Of this kind was 1. Samuel the Prophet, who diſſolued the ſucceſſion of Saul. 2. Achia the Prophet who diuided Ieroboam from Rehoboam: 5. Elias the Prophet, who ſlew theſe Baalites, and deſtroyed the meſſengers of the King: 6. Elizeus the Prophet who raiſed vp Iehu againſt Ahab and his family: and 2. Chron. 26. 
                           Nathan and Dauid Prophets who preferred Salomon in ſucceſſion. Therefore your Chriſtus cùm ciecit Mercatores è templo, non quaſi Regia aut Pontificia autoritate, ſed, more Prophetarum, zelo quodam: quemadmodum Phinees occidit ſcortatores, & 2. 5. 6. examples be ſatisfied. For in them, that will holde which Bellarmine acknowledgeth in one

                        King Ozias was ſtrucke by the hand of God with leproſie, and therefore by the law of God might not come into the common ſocietie of men, for feare of contagion. He was not therefore depoſed from his ſoueraigntie, but only as a ſicke King diſabled and debarred the ordinarie execution. A thing ſo manifeſt, that your owne Doctor calleth this your aſſertion Hoc (quod obijcit Bellar. ſupra chap. 3.) ipſa imprimis Biblia, hiſtorici etiam atque interpretes falſitatis arguunt: nunquam enim de regno eiectus fuit Ozias, ſed tamdiù regnauit, quamdiù virit, nempè, totos quinquaginta duos annos ex quo regnum anno aetatis decimo ſexto inierat, vt patet 4.

                           Most falſe, and contrarie to the direct hiſtorie of the Bible, and ancient Interpretors, becauſe it is manifeſt (ſaith he) that he died a King, and his Sonne during his leproſie was only Rector, &c.

                        This example is ſatisfied Supra in the firſt Anſwer. already: only now I will adde a confirmation of that which hath beene ſaid. Athalia (2.

So plaine, that the fore-cited Doctor doth yeeld vnto it: Expulſit Iehoida Athaliam quae immani tyran.

                        This example of Saul and Dauid, (if there were no other in the whole booke of God) might ſuffice for full determination of this cauſe: for there is nothing which you can pretend for the iuſt depoſing of any perſon, which is not correſpondent in this example.

Now, we argue contrarily, Ergo this may not be attempted of Gods Miniſters. 1. becauſe Elias was no Prieſt, but a Prophet, that is, his calling was not ordinarie, but extraordinarie, as appeareth by his act, [Fire from heauen] a worke miraculous. 2.

                           He who ſucceedeth a King violently murdered of any, though of a godly zeale, yet ought he to reuenge his Predeceſſors death by the death of the male factors.
                        
                        Thus much of the old Teſtament concerning the law of Subiection; wherein we haue many lawes to obey Kings, but none to reſiſt: We aſcend to the new Teſtament ſealed by Chriſt his death, whoſe ſpeech is true concerning the Ciuill law of the prerogatiue of Kings which he ſpake of the Morall law of God, Matth. 5. 17. 
                           I come not to deſtroy the Law, but to fulfill the Law.

                              A Prince is the ſpirituall ſheepe of a Prieſt, but a Prieſt cannot be called the ſonne of a Prince: for Priests haue their ſpirituall Gouernour, to whom they are ſubiect both in ſpirituall and temporall matters, and to no other.

Duplex fortitudinis poteſtas eſt, altera in faciendo res arduas animosè, altera in patiendo res aduerſas conſtantèr: cùm igitur illa, quae in patiendo conſiſtit, ſit praeſtantior, hanc patiendi poteſtatem ſibi ac ſuis Chriſtus elegit, vt mundum in admirationem potentiae ſuae cohuerteret. Idcirco Apoſtoli & primi Apoſtolorum ſucceſſores hoc myſterium non ignorantes, ab armis pro fide ſumendis abſtinuerunt. Sunderus quo ſupra. cap. 13. 
                              There is a double power, of fortitude, and Chriſtian valour, (ſaith he) The one in ſuffering aduerſitie conſtantly, the other in attempting and effecting hard matters couragiouſly: that power of ſuffering, as more excellent, Chriſt choſe as fittest for himſelfe, and his Apoſtles, and their ſucceſſors for the gaining of the world to the faith, and therefore they did abſtaine from armes and preſcribe obedience.

Nay but if the patient ſuffering of the tyranny of Kings, be (as your Sanders truely ſaid) the more excellent Chriſtian power, than acting and working the death of Kings: and that therefore that power was practized of our Lord Chriſt, and beſtowed on the Apoſtles for the confirmation of the glorious faith: pardon vs if we fall at Ieſus feet, to chooſe the better part: eſpecially knowing that 2.

                           IN former ages Chriſtians (ſaid your Bellarmine) did not depoſe wicked Emperours, as Diocletian, Iulian, and ſuch, becauſe they wanted force. Which maketh ſome Catholicks (ſaid your Bannes) now not reſiſting their Kings, excuſable, becauſe they want force: For it is commendable (ſaid your Frenchman) to ſuffer when thou canſt not reſiſt. Otherwiſe Catholickes (ſaid your Creſwell) are bound to hazard their liues in this cauſe, aſſooue as they can make reſiſtance.

Martyrs of thoſe times, when they by reaſon of their multitude, might eaſily haue conſpired againſt their perſecuting Tyrants; (Hearken you conſpirators and be aſhamed) yet for the honour of Chriſt by performing obedience to the higher power choſe rather to ſuffer then reſiſt.

                     FIrſt Tertullian in his Apologie in defence of Chriſtian loyalty. Abſit vt virtute humana vindicetur Chriſtiana ſecta, aut doleat pati in quo probatur: ſi enim hoſtes extraneos, nō tantùm occultos, vindices agere vel. lemus, deeſſet vis numerorum aut copiarum? externi ſumus, & veſtra omnia implemus vrbes, inſulas, caſtella, municipia, conciliabula, caſtra ipſa, tribus, decurias, Senatum, forum; ſola vobis templa reliquimus: cui bello non idonei, non prompti ſuiſſemus, etiam impares copijs trucidamur, ſi non apud iſtam diſciplinam magis occidi liceret quàm occidere?

                        God forbid (ſaith he) that Chriſtian profeſſours ſhould reuenge themſelues with humane power, or feare that touch of perſecution whereby they are tried: for if we would either ſeeke ſecret reuenge, or vſe open hoſtility, can you imagine we could want ſufficient force? we are viſibly knowen vnto you, and are intereſted in all your affaires, your Cities, Iles, Forts, Borrowes, Tents, Tribes, Decuries, Senate, Ma

                           kets are all full of Chriſtians, except only your temples. Now what warre are not we ready and ſit for, who being in power moe, yet do willingly ſuffer

death, if by this profeſſion it were not more lawfull to be killed, than to kill? Heerein you who boaſt often of yours as great multitudes in England, as there were locuſts in Aegypt, able to do miſchiefe if you would, and profeſſing alſo to be willing as ſoone as you are able: Compare but your God ſpeed, with Tertullian his God forbid, and then you ſhall ſee that God cannot be ſaid to be otherwiſe in your Popes Buls to kings, than he was in Aarons calfe, for in both there is a ſinne of rebellion againſt Gods ordinance.
                     The ſecond is Cyprian; he likewiſe penneth an Apology, and directeth it to Demetrianus the Officer of the perſecuting Emperour, anſwering in behalfe of all the Chriſtians of his time. Laedere ſeruos Dei & Chriſti perſecutionibus tuis deſine, quos laeſos diuina vltio defendit: indè enim eſt quod nemo noſtrū, quandò apprehenditur, reluctatur; nec ſe aduerſus iniuſtā violentiam, quamuis nimius & copioſus ſit noſter populus, vlciſcitur, &c.

Whereby you are taught not to glory of patience, who (if you had force) would baniſh obedience.
                     The third is Athanaſius, writing an Apologie for himſelfe to Conſtantius an Arian Emperor, and therfore hereticall; to free himſelfe of a ſlanderous imputation, which was that he had ſuggeſted ſome matter to the Emperour Conſtance a Catholicke, thereby to kindle coales of diſſention betwixt Brethren; therefore he ſaith. Deum teſte muoco in animā meam, & teſtis eſt frater tuus, me nunquam tui mentionē in malam partem eſſe loquutū; non adeò inſanus fui, neque oblitus ſum mā
                           dau Domini, Non maledices Regivel in corde

                        I call God to record vpon my ſoule, and your Brother Conſtance could witneſſe, that I neuer ſpake word of you in euill part; I was not ſo madde as to forget the commandement of God, who ſaith; Thou ſhall not ſpeake euill of thy King, no not in thy hart: but did obey your command, when I had charge to depart from Alexandria. The ſumme is this. When he had power to ſtirre the Emperour Conſtance a true profeſſor, againſt his brother Conſtantius an hereticke; yet he made conſcience, not to raiſe rebellion, but rather ſubmitted himſelfe to the violence of perſecution. If your Pope had beene truly catechized in this Creed of Athanaſius belonging to the truth of faithfull allegeance, he

would not ſo oft haue raiſed King againſt King, as your ſelues confeſſed: And why then may not hee be that man prophecied of, Apoc. 6. 4. 
                        Sitting on a red horſe, and hauing power (permiſſiuely) giuen vnto him, to take peace from the earth, and that they ſhould kill one another?
                     
                     The fourth is Gregory Nazianzene, in his Oration againſt the Emperour Iulian, who (the very hinge of this cauſe) had beene a Chriſtian, and did after Apoſtate and proue an Infidell, ſaith: In quos veſtiûm populum, exaeſt
                              •

                     The fifth is Ambroſe. When the Emperour infected with the hereſie of Arius, had ſent magiſtrates to remoue Ambroſe from his Biſhopricke, and the people thronged to reſcew him, Auxentius haeret. de Imperatore vult inuidiam cō
                           moucre, &c. quaſi verò ſuperiori anno, quādo ad palatium ſuum petitus, cùm praeſentibus Primatibus, ante conſiſtotium tractaretur, cùm Imperator Baſilicam vellet atripere, ego tunc aulae regalis contemplatione fractus ſim, nonne nouerunt, quod vbi me cognouit populus palatium petiſſe, ita irruit vt vim eius ferre non poſſent? nonnè tunc rogatus ſum vt populum muto ſermone mulcerem? reuocaui populum, & tamen inuidiam non euaſi, quam quidem inuidiam ego temperandam arbitror, non timendam. Ambroſ. Tom. 3. lib. 5. poſt Epiſt. 32. Oratio ad Auxent. Et Lachrymae meae arma mea ſunt, alitèr nec debeo, nec poſſum reſiſtere. Ibid.
                         
                        In ſuch power (ſaith Ambroſe) that the Officers could not reſiſt their force; I quieted the people, and yet could not auoid their malice. Then ſure he did abhorre by raiſing ſedition among the people, to prouoke magiſtrates to malice. The ſame Father vpon that penitentiall dumpe of holy Dauid, [Pſal. 51. 6. 
                        to thee only haue I ſinned▪
                         proueth that ſome Qui tenentur legibus audent ſuum negare peccatum, dedignantur rogare indulgentiam, quam petebat Dauid, qui nullis tenebatur legibus humanis, neque enim vllis ad poenam vocantur legibus tuti imperij poteſtate.

power is giuen vnto you not only in worldly regiment, but alſo (Spirituall) for the preſeruation of the Church.

                           For (as the ſame your author witneſſeth) It was an ancient cuſtome and of long continuance, and till Adrian the Pope in the yeare of Chriſt 815. without contradiction, that the Emperour did confirme the election of the Pope, that none could be Pope without the approbation of the Emperour: which cuſtome

after the death of Adrian was inforce, till Pope Gregory the 9. which was in the yeare 1072. But now we ſee a new and contrary countenance of the ſtate of Chriſtendome, which the Lawiers deplore as miſerable, and complaine that the Emperour loſt his priuiledge by coſenage and deceit. &c. How it was we leaue the caſe to be diſputed among your Romiſts: that heere is a change of Antiquity it is not denied, either by your Balbus, or Aliquando ſaecularis Principis, vt Imperatores & alij, Pontificem eligebant, vt patet Cap.

                           Carerius, or any other. Hence we argue.
                        That if power of approbation of the election of the Emperour do conferre a temporall authority Emperiall vpon the Pope, then when the Pope was confirmed by Emperours there was in the Emperour a ſpirituall authority ouer the Pope: if you will deny our latter conſequent, then you teach vs to deny your former.

                        Firſt from Gods ordinance. An igitur, inquiunt, nunquam Principibus reſiſtere liceat? huic quaeſtioni non corrupto & temerario carnis noſtrae iudicio, cui frequentèr recta ſunt, quae coram Deo ſtultiſſima & impia reputantur; ſed ea diu nis literis, quae nemini blandiuntur, reſpondendum eſſe puto. Nam vtcunque veriſimilitèr nobis humanitùs ratiocinari videmur, naturali iure nobis licitum eſſe nos noſtraque defendere: Diuina tamen Lexid contra ſublimiorem poteſtatem armis fierivetat: quemadmodum Chriſtus Dominus Petro volenti Dominum defendere, dixit [Conuerte gladium tuum in vaginam tuam, omnes enim qui gladium acceperint gladio peribunt] Non enim ſubditi contra Poteſtatem, ſed poteſtas contra ſubditos gladium diuinitùs accepit. Cunerus lib. de Offic. Princ. cap. 7.

your Cunerus diuinely reaſoneth) which is not partiall, and not by the ſelfe-pleaſing fancy of ſenſuall affection muſt this queſtion bee determined. Though therefore it may ſeeme to vs a decree of nature for euery one to defend himſelfe and the things he doth enioy; yet the law of God doth forbid to doe this by taking armes againſt the higher powers: as our L. Chriſt taught his Diſciple now about to defend his Maſter, [Put vp thy ſword, for he that ſmiteth with the ſword, ſhall periſh with the ſword.] Becauſe the ſword is not put into the hands of Subiects againſt their Kings, but into the hands of Kings againſt Subiects.

                           Rom. 13. 
                           He that reſiſteth the power reſiſteth the ordinance of God.] And againe [

                        The ſecond is the conſideration of examples of the primitiue Church, when for the ſpace of 300. yeares, it was in grieuous perſecution: where (as S. Paul ſpeaketh) the faithfull Rom. 12. 19. 
                           fought with beaſts after the manner of men: namely, (as ſome doe allegorize) with men as ſauage as beaſts; and there was found no power on earth to reſtraine that earthly power. Was therefore God awanting to his Church? God forbid. Nay rather he was not awanting, for it is written, 1. Cor. 15. 32. 
                           Vertue is perfected in infirmity. And againe, 2. Cor. 12. 9. 
                           As gold is purgedin the fire, So by affliction &c. Becauſe, 2. Cor. 22. 
                           When the outward man ſuffereth the inward man is renued: And 2. Cor. 12. 
                           When I am weake, then am I ſtrong. As therefore the wiſedome of the Artiſt is then preſent with the gold, when he is refining it; the Phyſician with his Patient when he woundeth to cure him: So whenſoeuer the three faithfull be in the fiery furnace Dan. 3. 25. 
                           Behold a fourth, that is, a diuine ſuccourer either by the inward miracle of comfort in patience, or the outward of deliuerance.
                        The third is the view of your owne Popiſh Principles,

                           Inſidels conuerted to Chriſtian faith, do not therefore loſe their former temporall right. Which we haue already prooued by your owne confeſſions, and more then ten circles of Antiquity. We argue further now from this knowen principle; Princes by conuerſion to the Goſpell loſe no temporall right, which they had before their conuerſion: But in the ſtate of Infidelitie we neuer reade that they could be depoſed by their Pagan Prieſts. Ergo, this their prerogatiue may not be impaired by their obedience vnto the Goſpell: nay, it is rather confirmed thereby, euen in this text, eſpecially in three degrees.
                        Firſt, it teacheth greater Chriſtian reuerence, becauſe in the Prince a Chriſtian man doth not behold only man, but the hand of God, Rom. 13. 4. 
                           He is the Miniſter of God. Secondly, from Chriſtian feare: For Pagans, as hirelings, onely performed obedience propteriram, for feare of the temporall Sword; which man (becauſe it is in the hand of man) might auoid by many meanes: But Chriſtians, [Rom. 13. 2 
                           He that reſiſteth purchaſeth damnation,] are dutifull for feare of the eternall wrath of the iuſt omnipotent God. Thirdly, from Chriſtian confidence, For Pagans, aſſoone as the King doth tyrannize, do rebel, as though freedome corporall were their ſpeciall good: but Chriſtians Rom. 13. 3. 
                           [Wilt thou not feare the power? doe good and thou ſhalt haue praiſe of God in ſuffering outward euill for well doing are confirmed in the hope of an euerlaſting good. Fourthly, from the bond of Chriſtian loue, for Pagans by their Princes commands are naturally inclined to diſcontent and hate: but Chriſtians [verſ. 8. 
                           Loue is the fulfilling of the law] are by the law of Loue made perfect to obey

the iuſt lawes of men. If therefore Chriſtians would, as they ought, be ſubiect to the law of Chriſt, I ſuppoſe there is no Pagan Prince (if perſwaded of this doctrine of Chriſt) but would more eaſily be a Chriſtian.

                           The Apoſtle doth not reſtraine his ſpeech to any kind of ſuperiour power, but ſpeaketh generally of [powers that be:] ſignifying aſwell the ſpirituall power, as the temporall. Therefore Proteſtants may not conclude heereupon, that the Pope ought to be ſubiect vnto temporall Kings.

                     THat this ſoueraignity of his Maieſty (whereunto, notwithſtanding all Papall iuriſdiction, we doe willingly

ſubſcribe) may be knowen to be as anciently as earneſtly challenged, I will only point at ſome few heads of examples of our ancient Chriſtian Kings, which Sir Edward Cooke, his Maieſties Attorney generall, in his alwaies reportable and memorable Reports hath lately publiſhed.
                     
                        Reports. part. 1. fol. 12. 
                        In the raigne of K. Edward the firſt, a Subiect brought in a 
                        1 
                        Bull of excommunication againſt another Subiect of this realme, and publiſhed it: But it was anſwered that this was then, according to the ancient lawes of England, Treaſon againſt the King; the Offendor had beene drawen and hanged, but that by the mercy of the Prince he was only abiured the Realme. Compare this Bull, which did only puſh at a Subiect againſt his benefice, with that Bull which more mankeen goareth Kings, to giue them their mortall wound. At the ſame time The Pope by his Bull had by way of prouiſion beſtowed a benefice vpon one within the prouince of Yorke; the King preſented another: the Arch-biſhop refuſeth the Kings preſentation, and yeelded to the Popes prouiſion. This Arch-biſhop then by the common law of the land was depriued of the lands of his whole Biſhoprick during life.

                        to a Benefice, and his Preſentee was diſturbed by one, who had obtained Buls from Rome, for the which cauſe he was condemned to perpetuall impriſonment. Compare this Bull of diſturbing onely the Preſent of Kings with that which doth ordinarily violate the Kings perſon.

                        In the raigne of King Edward the fourth, the opinion of the 
                        5 
                        Kings bench was, that whatſoeuer ſpirituall man ſhould ſue another ſpirituall man in the Court of Rome for a matter ſpirituall, where hee might haue remedy before his Ordinary within the Realme, did incurre the danger of premunire, being an hainous offence againſt the honour of the King his crowne and dignity. Compare this with their Acts, who haue made no other ſute at Rome, but meanes to diſpoſſeſſe Engliſh Kings of their crowne and dignity. Many other examples of like nature I pretermit, and remit the Reader deſirous to be further ſatiſfied to the booke of Reports, Habet enim ille quod det, & dat nemo largius. The concluſion is, that that challenge of Soueraigntie which was in oppoſition to the Popes Buls, ancient right and iuſtice in Kings which were predeceſſours, be not traduced now as an irreligious impiety, in the ſucceſſors. The like might be ſpoken of France, but I haſten to the laſt Argument, preſuming that my ſtudious Reader peruſing the French ſtories will eaſe me of that trauell.

                     IT will be ſufficient onely ſummarily to recapitulate the Arguments diſperſed in this former Treatiſe.
                     The firſt Reaſon was long ſince Chriſtened: for The Apoſtles (ſaith your Supra cap. 7. Sanders) did chuſe rather to ſuffer euill, than to reuenge: wherein they were ſeconded by other heroicall Martyrs of Chriſt, Who thought (ſaith your Supra cap. 8. Toloſſanus) their faith glorified in this, that being perſecuted, yet they performed obedience. Queſtionleſſe they had ſome reaſon heereof: One is ſpecified by S. Cyprian, Ibidem. 
                        Chriſtians muſt be Preachers of the ſupernaturall vertue patience, and not of vengeance.
                     
                     Another by S. Auguſtine, that Ibidem. 
                        Induring the miſery of this life, they may auouch their hope of a life eternall. And laſtly by

Arnobius, Heereby to make diſtinction of Chriſtian obedience, from that other of Pagans: that whereas theſe yeeld onelie obedience proceeding from feare of man, ours ſhould appeare to be from Conſcience towards God.
                     
                     The ſecond Reaſon is politicke, which is that of your Supra cap. 6. Victoria, that the Clergy be members of the common-wealth: Ergo, they ought to be ſubiect vnto the ſtate temporall. I will adde another of this kind which wee borrowed from your Acoſta, ſhewing that licence of depoſing Kings, is an 
                        Supr. cap. 10. 
                        occaſion of much ſpoiles and bloudſhed.
                     
                     The third Reaſon is violent inforcing you by your owne confeſſions to grant our concluſion; your confeſſions be of two kinds; firſt, Bellarmine and all Ieſuits. vide ſupra. 
                        The Pope hath not temporall Soueraignty ouer Kings directly, but onely indirectly, in ordine ad bonum ſpirituale, that is, as the temporall doth neceſſarily helpe or aduance the ſpirituall good of the Church. But Quia ſequeretur hinc, quòd nec Rex directè Dominus eſſet in tēporalibus, quia cuilibet Regi competit dominium in ordine ad ſpiritualia, vt ad iuſtitiam adminiſtrandam. Carerius lib. 2. de Rom. Pont. cap. 7. n. 13. 
                        So you may as well ſay (ſaith your Carerius) that a King hath not iuriſdiction temporall, but only indirectly; becauſe his authority doth intend a ſpirituall good, a
                              •
                            namely preſeruation of iuſtice in a common-wealth. And he ſaith truely as may be confirmed by Saint Auguſtine. Alitèr ſeruiunt Reges, quia homines ſunt, aliter quia Reges; quia homines ſunt, Deo ſeruiunt rectè viuendo; vt Reges ſunt in regno ſuo bona iubendo mal áque prohibendo, non ſolùm quae pertinent ad humanam ſocietatem, verum-etiam quae ad Diuinam religionem conſeruandam conducunt leges ſanciendo. Auguſtinus ſupra.
                         
                        A king as a man (ſaith he) doth ſerue God by his owne good life; as a King, by gouerning other mens liues, to ſee that they doe that which is good: It is his office not only to ordaine lawes for the preſeruation of the politicke peace, but alſo to eſtabliſh true religion. From hence I conclude: that if this your diſtinction be good The Pope hath temporall iuriſdiction ouer Kings to depoſe them, indirectly: that is, as far foorth as may be behooffull for Religion: then muſt you grant that Kings haue iuriſdiction temporall onely indirectly, becauſe their Office alſo is ordained of God [in ordine ad Deum] as a miniſter of God for defence of his Church. If your poſition be falſe, then hath not your Pope that power ouer Princes, no not indirectly.
                     The ſecond Confeſſion I take from Carerius, your moſt

importunate, and moſt impudent magnifier of Papall authority, that (excepting your Bozius) we can reade of. This Carerius reaſoneth thus: Donatio Conſtantini vel vera

                        The Donation of Conſtantine to the Pope (whereby the poſſeſſion of all the kingdoms in Europe were beſtowed vpon the Pope) was either true or falſe; if true, then the Princes of the Weſt parts hold their thrones by the Popes authority: if falſe, then had Pope Zachary no authority to confirm K. Pepin of France, nor Leo the third to conſtitute Emperor Charles the great &c. This your Doctor giueth vs this antecedent propoſition. If the pretended Donation of Conſtantine to the Pope be counterſet, then hath not the Pope authority to diſpoſe of theſe Kingdomes. But, Canus vide ſupra.

                     The fourth from a neceſſary conſequent, ſtrengthened by the authority of S. Bernard, who writeth vnto Eugenius the Pope concerning this very point. His argument is; The ſucceſſour of S. Peter cannot challenge anie authority as deſcending from Peter, which Peter had not in himſelfe: Apoſtolis interdicitur dominatus; ergo aut tu vſurpare audi aut dominans Apoſtolatum, aut Apoſtolus dominatum? Et paulò poſt: Non iure Apoſtolico haec tibi vendicares, ne

                            enim ille, quod non habuit, tibi dare potuit. Bernard. lib. 2. de Conſider. ad Eugen.
                         
                        But Peter had not this temporall. Ergo, (for Eugenius did not challenge it directy eſſentiall to the Popedome) the Pope, by S. Bernards iudgement, may not aſſume any ſuch authority either directly or indirectly.
                     We may conclude, that both direct ſcripture, torrēt of Fathers, and euidence of reaſons do all confute this Papall Vſurpation ouer Kings as a challenge meerely ambitious, fraudulent, and rebellious. Come you therefore out of Babylon in this point with holy Bernard, and put vpon you his

Mark, S. Bernard maketh this neceſſity of ſubiection an article of Chriſtian morality neceſſarily to be defended vpon danger of damnation: relying vpō a canon: what, Papall? of Si quis noſtris mandatis? &c. no, but Rom. 13.

                        where (as their owne learned Biſhop ſaith) there is nothing but lying? Of which kind (by the aſſiſtance of the ſpirit of truth) I ſhall proue this Aequiuocation to be, and alſo the approbation thereof: ſhewing that not one iota in all Scripture, not one example in all Catholicke antiquity, not one ſhadow of reaſon in all the wit of naturall man can be brought for the iuſt proofe or colour of this Mysterie of iniquitie.
                     
                     Firſt we muſt vnderſtand that our Aequiuocatours teach a double kind of Aequiuocation.
                     The firſt is a mentall reſeruation in the mind, differing from that which I outwardly expreſſe, whether it be by voice or writing. Their example: The Preface in the front of the booke of Aequiuocation, and the Argument of the booke. 
                        If a Catholicke or any other perſon before a Magiſtrate ſhall be demanded vpon his oath, whether a Prieſt be in ſuch a place, may (notwithſtanding his perfect knowledge to the contrary) without periurie ſecurely in conſcience anſwer no, with a ſecret meaning reſerued in his mind, namely that he is not there ſo, vt (loquar enim Latinè, ne hinc Idiotae anſam ſibi arripiant nequitèr mentiendi) quis teneatur illud detegere.
                     
                     The ſecond is a verball Aequiuocation, whether it be vocall, that is, vttered in the voice, or literall, that is, expreſſed in writing: when one word ſhall import two or moe different ſignifications: as thus, To go to faſt: the word faſt, whether vocall or literall, doth equally ſignifie to abſtaine from meat, and alſo, to make haſte. By liberty of this Aequiuocation one merily did play vpon his friend going at dinner time to a churles houſe, O ſir (ſaith he) you go to faſt. But to vſe the example of our Aequiuocatours; The ſame popiſh Treatiſe,

                     Concerning theſe two kinds of Aequiuocations I make two concluſions to be manifeſted in this diſpute.
                     Our firſt concluſion is this; Euery Aequiuocation by a mentall Reſeruation is not an hidden truth, but a groſſe 
                           •…
                        e.
                     The ſecond concluſion is this; Euery Aequiuocation, (whether it be mentall or verball) if it be vſed in an oath, though it be no lie, yet is it an abhominable profanation of that ſacred Inſtitution of God; by whomſoeuer or to whomſoeuer this oath be performed.
                     To prooue that Aequiuocating by a mentall Reſeruation is a lying falſhood, we muſt firſt diſtinguiſh of falſhood, leſt the doubtfulneſ

                        e of this word falſhood, dull the vnderſtanding of my religious Reader, not to perceiue the State of the Queſtion.
                     There is a double kind of falſhood in ſpeech; The firſt hath reſpect to the thing ſpoken, the other to the mind of the ſpeaker. The example of the former: If thinking it to be ten of the clocke (when it is but nine) I ſhall ſay it is ten, this is falſe, but not a lie: Becauſe Nemo mē

                        None muſt be iudged a liar (ſaith Saint Auguſtine) who ſpeaketh falſe, thinking it to be true which he ſpeaketh: becauſe heerein his purpoſe is not to deceiue the hearer, but he is only deceiued in himſelfe. The other, when thinking that to be falſe which I ſpeake, I affirme it to be true, (and ſo on the contrary) as thinking it to be ten of the clocke, ſhall ſay it is nine: thus whether it be ten, or no, I do lie: and thus ſometimes a man doth lie in ſpeaking a truth. As the Client, who hauing in his pocket both counterfet and currant gold, intending to cozen his Counſellour with the woorſe mettall, by chance gaue him the better, ſaying; Sir, I cannot be vnthankefull to any that ſhall

deſerue well, heere is an Angell, and ſo he departed a falſly true, a deceiued deceiuer, and an vnthankefully thankefull man. The firſt kind of falſe ſpeech is againſt truth, as it is defined Logically, A congruity or conſent of the ſpeech with the thing: the ſecond falſhood is defined morally, as it is oppoſite to truth, which is a conſonancy of the speech with the vnderſtanding of the speaker, and this falſity we call properly a lie.

                        The former kind (ſaith S. Auguſtine) speaketh falſlie for want of knowledge: the latter speaketh falſly againſt his knowledge and conſcience, properly a liar. And only of this liar now we frame our diſpute.

                        Suffer me Socratically to debate this point with you, and anſwer me friendly to theſe demands: Q. When being asked, whether you are a Prieſt, you anſwer No, what ſignification hath this word No? R. It doth ſignifie directly, I am no Prieſt. Q. And yet you thinke you are a Prieſt. R. Yea I know it: Q. Wherewith doe you know it? R. By my inward mind and vnderſtanding, my conſcience teſtifying this vnto me. Q. Can conſcience beare witneſſe? then can it alſo ſpeake. R. It ſpeaketh as verily to my inward ſoule, as my tongue ſpeaketh ſenſibly to your eares. Q. When therefore I aske you whether you be a Prieſt, your conſcience ſaying to your ſelfe, I am; would it not ſay the ſame to me likewiſe if I could heare it? R. Certainly it would. Q. Yet it may be your mind may demurre or varie in that which it thinketh, as namely, thinking thus, [I am a Prieſt] yet to be able to perſwade your ſoule, and ſay, [I am no Prieſt.] R. Vnpoſſible, for this is an infallible poſition, Mens non poteſt non intelligere quod intelligit: The mind cannot poſſibly but thinke that which it thinketh. Q. And it is as vnpoſſible but, [I am] the direct voice of your conſcience, and [I am not] the expreſſe voice of your tongue, muſt be as contrary as yea and nay. R. True. Q. Then will this be as true, that when your conſcience affirmeth that which your tongue denieth, that your tongue ſpeaketh, againſt your Conſcience. Prooued in the beginning of this chapter by common conſent. And this is that which we haue proued to be flat lying, a concluſion which no art of Aequiuocation can poſſibly auoid.
                        Our Aequiuocator conceiteth a double intention of the mind, the one directly reſpecting the ſignification of the words; and thus they grant that the Nay of their tongue was contrary to the yea of their vnderſtanding: the ſecond is an

indirect intention, which is a clauſe of Reſeruation, [Vt dicam tibi.] Whereby they would reconcile their tongue to their mind. Whereas our Witneſſes haue thus determined, that truth and falſity doth conſiſt only in the conformity or contrariety of the ſignification of the words, and direct intention of the mind, plainely calling it a lie, When one ſhall ſpeake words (ſaith Aquinas) which doe not ſignifie that which he intendeth: When he ſpeaketh otherwiſe then he thinketh, ſaith S. Hierome: When he ſpeaketh that which hee thinketh is falſe, ſaith S. Auguſtine. But the indirect intention of the ſpeaker [Vtreuelem tibi] cannot alter the ſignification of his outward words, [I am no Prieſt] which his direct intention of conſcience doth contradict, ſaying, [But I am a Prieſt.] Ergo our Aequiuocating Prieſt cannot poſſibly reconcile ſuch a contradiction of his hart and his tongue. Wherefore we will deſire S. Auguſtine to conclude againſt our Aequiuocatours; Da mihi aliquem qui iurat verū eſſe, quòd ſcit eſſe falſum, videtis iſta quàm deteſtanda ſit bellua.

                           WE will ſpeake with Ariſtotle and the Logicians ſpeaking of foure propoſitions: firſt mentall, only conceiued in the minde; ſecondly vocall, vttered with my mouth; thirdly written (which I haue called literall;) and the fourth mixt, when we mingle ſome of theſe propoſitions together, when one part is expreſſed outwardly, as to ſay [I know him not:] the other part reſerued in my mind, as to ſay, [Vt tibi ſignificem] both ioined together make vp one true propoſition.

                        Dare you appeale vnto Logicke? This is the Art of all Arts, and the high Tribunall of reaſon and truth it ſelfe,

which no man in any matter, whether it be caſe of humanity or diuinity can iuſtly refuſe.
                        Conſult therefore with the ancient Logicians, and proue (marke what ſcope I yeeld vnto you) that from the beginning of the world in the whole currant of ſo many thouſand generations of mankinde, till within the compaſſe of theſe laſt foure hundred yeeres, and leſſe, that euer any Logician, whether Infidell or Beleeuer, did allow your mixt propoſition (which is partly mentall, and partly verball) or thinke it a Propoſition: and I will be (which my ſoule vtterly deteſteth) an Aequiuocator.
                        Yet I muſt not now expect impoſſibilities, to trie what you would proue, but ſhew herein what I can diſproue.
                     
                     
                        The Argument.
                        Your propoſition [I am no Priest,] mixed with your mentall reſeruation, [Vt tibireuelem;] if it be true, it is ſo either in his ſimple ſignification, or by vertue of Aequiuocation: but it is not true in his ſimple ſignification; this you grant: neither can it be true by vertue of Aequiuocation; this I prooue.

                           Aequiuocation in word or ſpeech (ſayth the Oracle of all Logicians) is when one word or one ſpeech doth equally ſignifie diuers things. As when one ſhall ſay, I am afrayd of a Dogge: this word Dogge hath a triple ſignification; for it ſignifieth aſwell a fiſh in the ſea, called a Dogge-fiſh, & a ſigne in the heauenly ſpheare, wherein when the Sun hath his courſe, we call the dayes Dogge-dayes; or as thirdly, it doth ſignifie mans faithfull ſeruant, a barking dogge. Therefore when he ſayth, I feare a Dogge, whether he meaneth he is afrayd of the houſholde dogge to be bit with his teeth, or to be drowned, and ſo deuoured of the Sea dogge, or to goe mad by the poiſonfull influences of the Planeticall dogge: If, I ſay, he vnderſtand any of theſe kinds, this his ſpeech is true, [I am afrayd of a dogge.] But your mixt and patched propoſition is not one word or ſpeech ſignifying equally diuers

things; but contrarily (as you pretend) diuers parts of ſpeech (one in the minde, and another in the mouth) ſignifying one thing: for, I am no Prieſt, and To tell it to the, what words can be more different? which whoſoeuer ſhall call Aequiuocall, may be iuſtly ſuſpected to be bit with the higheſt dogge; the poſition is ſo abſurd and vnreaſonable.

                           Voices and writings are ordemed for inſtruments and ſignes to expreſſe a Propoſition which is in the minde; therefore may I expreſſe all in word or all in writing, and the propoſition in the minde remaineth the ſame. So may I by another mixt propoſition expreſſe ſome part, and reſerue ſome part in my minde. For example, If when I ſay [God is not] ſhould loſe preſently my ſpeech, before I could vtter the word following [vniuſt,] which hauing my pen in my hand, I exhibit by writing; who doubteth, but all that is but one propoſition, the trueth whereof conſiſteth of the mixture of both parts together? So is it where one part is deliuered with the mouth, and the other reſerued in the minde.

                        It were better that both you & I ſhould become ſpeechleſſe and handleſſe, than either in word or writing to miniſter ſuch a bainfull Concluſion vnto the world. But to the matter: Voices and writings (ſay you) are outward ſignes of the inward propoſitions of the minde. This is true: What then? And the part wanting in voice is ſupplied by the other word in writing. This is alſo true: But why? Becauſe words and writings be mutuall ſignes and interpretations of the minde. This is againe moſt true: What can you inferre from all this? So the ſignification of the part outwardly expreſſed [I am no Prieſt] may be ſupplied with the other part of the propoſition reſerued in my minde [Vt tibinarrem.] I tell you this compariſon

is vtterly falſe. For the foreſaid Oracle in his booke intituled, The interpretation of ſpeech, ſaith, that

                           Euery propoſition enunciatiue (that is, euery outward ſpeech, whether by word or writing, whether affirming or denying) is ordeined for ſignification: that is, (as you haue well ſaid) to expreſſe ſome thing. But no mentall, or inward conceit of the minde is ordeined of God as a ſigne to expreſſe or ſignifie (as words and writings doe) but as a thing ſignified hath need to be expreſſed and expounded. Such is your mentall clauſe reſerued [Vt narrem tibi.] Can you make this a ſigne or inſtrument to expreſſe & ſignifie your true meaning, which you haue purpoſely deuiſed for a den to lurke in, leſt your falſe meaning might be ſignified and reuealed? Thus haue you by your compariſon of voices and writings made a ſtrong loope whereby to ſtrangle your ſelfe.
                     
                     
                        This is confirmed by S. Auguſtine.

                           A ſpeech is ſo farre foorth true, as it is a ſigne of a true vnderſtanding. But your voice (you know) is contrary to your vnderſtanding. And as concerning Voice, which is the ſigne, he addeth from Ariſtotle, That it is againſt nature to ſignifie any thing by words which we haue not in our minde. If then this equiuocation be vnnaturall, we haue not without reaſon called it a Monſter. And now we will ſhew your vnnaturall countenance in a like example.

Sic proferre ſententiam vt diuerſam opinionem in alterius animo generes: haec eſt intentio fallendi aliū. Tol. Ieſ. Inſtr. Sacerd. lib. vlt. de Septempercatas cap. 54. 
                           For this is an intention to deceiue, (ſaith your Ieſuite) to ſeeke to beget a ſignification of your ſpeech in the mind of your hearer, diuers to that which you conceiue your ſelfe.
                        
                        Secondly, this your inſtance is falſe; for euery one that asketh a Queſtion, doth intend to receiue a direct anſwer: and therefore his anſwer, [I came not from Couentry] who came from Couentrie, cannot ſatisfie the intention of the Examiner.
                        Thirdly, though it ſhall ſatisfie the remote intention of the Examiner, yet is it a lewd lie in the ſpeaker, becauſe he that ſpeaketh truth hath alway a conformity betweene the intention of his mind and his ſpeech: but to deny, He came not from that place from whence he knoweth he came, is no conformity, but infinite contrariety between his ſpeech and his owne intention. An anſwer ſo groſly falſe, that a Ieſuite of high eſteeme in your church, writing againſt this ſpirituall

iugling of his ſubtile lying brethren, doth confeſſe, Quidam putant eum, qui venit ex loco aliquo peſte minime infecto, qui falsò habetur pro infecto, poſſe tuta conſcientia & citra mendacuum dicere, ſe non veniſſe ex eo loco, dūmodò intelligat ſe non veniſſe ex loco peſtilenti: quod ſi verum eſt, nihil tàm falſum eſſe poſſit, quod non queat ab omni mendacio libe

                           That if this kind of anſwer (concerning a place infected with the plague &c.) be not falſe, then there is no ſpeech ſo falſe, but it may be freed from falſhood: becauſe willingly to vſe words in a contrary ſenſe to that they ſignifie, is plaine lying. By whom you Aequiuocators may learne, that if the man you fancied came not from a place infected with bodily peſtilence, yet this your aequiuocating proceedeth from minds ſpiritually infected with the contagion of peſtilent lying. O but you are more ſubtile then your Aduerſaries; and ſo was the Gen. 3. 1.

                        The Minor proued.
                        This is a certaine maxime in Diuinity, grounded vpon the eternall commandement of God, [Exod. 20. 
                           Thou ſhalt not beare falſe witneſſe;] and expounded by his Prophet, Thou ſhalt ſweare in truth; and confeſſed by your Azorius, Illud Ierem. 4.

                           That is to ſweare both for the confirmation of a truth, and ſo alſo in truth as to thinke probably that true wherunto thou art ſworn. (Minor.) But our Acquiuocatours do neither ſweare from truth, nor for confirmation of truth. Ergo their oath is plaine periury. A concluſion thought ſo iuſt, that your owne great Moraliſt doth condemne all Aequiuocators heerein as periured liars; 
                           Quidam putauit fas eſſe cuiquam, vt vitam ſuam conſeruet, hoſti iurare, tantummodò eo ſenſu, quem mente intùs concipit: poſſemus enim hac ratione quiduis negare, & nihil non, abſque mendacio, dicere. Azor. ibid. cap. 4. §. Primò quidem.

God willing to ſhew more abundantly vnto the heires of promiſe the ſtableneſſe of his Counſell, bound himſelfe by an oath, that by two immutable things, wherein it is impoſſible that God ſhould lie, we might haue ſtrong conſolation &c. Heere we ſee the nature of a lie, Mendacium eſt malū tam intrinſecè, vt bonū reddi nullā ratione poſſit. Vaſques Ieſ. in Thom. diſp. 53. num. 22. 
                           To be ſo abſolutely euill in it owne nature, as (which all Diuines hold) that nothing can make it good. Therefore ſo it is ſaid, that to ſay it is vnpoſſible, that our good God, father of truth, ſhould lie: is as much as to ſay, it is impoſſible for goodneſſe to be euill, or for truth to be a

                           Maior.) That, which God can not doe by reaſon of lying iniquity, hath in it the iniquity of a lie. (Minor.) But your aequinocating conceit is that which for the lying iniquity thereof God can not poſſibly doe. Therefore it is a godleſſe and lying wickedneſſe.
                     
                     
                        The Minor proued.
                        If God by an oth of promiſing ſaluation in Chriſt could vſe your aequiuocation, then ſhould the Elect of God not haue any ſtrong conſolation, when God by word or oath he promiſeth life, and though Rom. 8. 16. 
                           his ſpirit witneſſeth to the ſpirits of his Elect, that they are the ſonnes of God, and that they ſhall no▪ periſh: yet might they ſuſpect (which blaſphemie

farre be it from the hearts of his Regenerate) that it is ſpoken with ſome ſecret reſerued clauſe of deluſion. Rom. 3. 4. 
                           But let God be true, and euery (eſpecially aequiuocating) man a liar, as it is written: for he who is Trueth will be iuſtified, when this ſect continuing in this ſinne muſt neceſſarily be condemned.
                     
                     
                        The principall ſubiect of lying is the Diuell.
                        Becauſe when the voice of the Almighty had denounced death to the Tranſgreſſours, ſaying, Gen. 2. 
                           Eating of this fruit ye ſhall die: the Diuell in his inſtrument contradicting that trueth, ſayd, Gen. 3. 
                           You ſhall not die at all: he is therefore truely called Ioh. 8. 44. 
                           A liar from the beginning. From whence we may argue thus.
                        
                           Maior.) That can not be a doctrine of trueth, which ſtoppeth a mans mouth, that he can not giue the Diuell the lie. (Minor.) But admitting your aequiuocation, all mankinde is ſilenced, as not able to giue the Diuell his due title of a Liar. Ergo aequiuocating is no doctrine of trueth.
                     
                     
                        The Minor proued.
                        For Eue, who was catechized in this trueth, God ſayd that if we eat we ſhall die, and hearing the Diuels contrary ſuggeſtion, Though you eat you ſhall not die: might ſhe not ſay to the ſerpent, Spirit thou lieſt? If ſhe might not, then is that no lying ſpirit, which is father of all lies: if ſhe might, then is your cloſe aequiuocating a lie. Otherwiſe, the Diuell might haue freed himſelfe as you do, ſaying, I ſayd truely, for I did aequiuocate.
                        
                     
                     
                        The Minor confirmed.
                        Though the Diuell haue plunged himſelfe in Abyſſum, the bottomleſſe gulfe of wickedneſſe, as to do wickedly for loue of wickedneſſe: Nemo tam i

                           Yet is there not the moſt deſperate ſinner

amongst men, but if he could, he had rather by honest than by wicked meanes atchieue whatſoeuer his wicked heart luſteth after. We will borrow of you an example: The moderate Anſwerer in his Epiſtle to his Maieſtie. 
                           The late intended conſpiracie, which (as you confeſſe) was ſo hainous an impiety, that God and heauen condemne it, men and earth detest it: Now then, what wickedneſſe vnder heauen would not theſe Conſpirators haue attempted, which haue beene found guilty of ſo damnable a miſchiefe? Yet am I perſuaded that for aduancement of their Religion they would neuer haue practiſed by powder, if they could haue preuailed with paper. All which I produce to this end, to let you vnderſtand, that if mentall aequiuocation were lawfull, and did qualifie a falſe ſpeech to free it from a lie, no man inſtructed in that Art would or could lie; and ſo we ſhould ſeeme to liue in an Outopia, where men ſhall be conuicted of moſt manifeſt aequiuocating falſhood; only he ſhall be the liar, that giueth the conuicted the lie.

                        ACts 5. 1. Ananias with Saphira his wife ſolde a poſſeſſion, and kept backe part of the price, his wife being of counſell with him; and the other part he brought and layd it downe at the Apoſtles feet. Then ſayd Peter, Why hath Satan filled thine heart that thou ſhould'st lie? thou haſt not lied vnto men, but vnto God. When Ananias heard theſe words, he fell downe and gaue vp the ghost. After this came in his wife, ignorant of that which was done; and Peter ſayd vnto her, Tell me, Sold you the land for ſo much? and ſhe ſayd, Yea, for ſo much: and Peter ſayd, Why haue you agreed together to tempt the ſpirit of the Lord? and ſhe fell downe, and yeelded vp the ghoſt.
                        
                        
                           
Theſe pretended to bring all their ſubſtance, and to tender it to the Apoſtles for the common good of the Saints, an act proper to the infancy of the Church: but they reſerued one halfe for ſupply of their peculiar vſes, if happily they might come to want. The woman is asked, Solde you the land but for ſo much? her anſwer is, Yea, but for ſo much: and yet this diſſimulation is called a lie. When ſhe anſwered, For ſo much, meaning but one halfe, concealing the other halfe, it was not poſſible but in that diſſimulation your reſerued clauſe muſt haue come into her minde, to thinke, But for ſo much: vt in commune bonum conferamus: or, vt alijs largiamur: or your owne crotchet, [Vt vobis ſignificemus.] Let any but enter into the meditation of ſuch a diſſimulation, and he ſhall finde it vnpoſſible but ſome ſuch conceit will be flittering like a butter-flie in his mind, and like one of the 1.

This is the firſt example of lying we reade of in Chriſtianity, wherein the actours by the viſible vengeance of God were ſtrucke dead ſuddenly and periſhed in their ſinne, and ſhould therefore teach you, that though you may delude man, who only iudgeth the mouth, (therefore S. Peter ſayd of it, Thou haſt not lied vnto men▪) yet for feare of the all-ſeeing iuſt God, not any more thus, Act. 5. 9.

                        Suppoſe there is a man ſo dangerouſly ſicke (ſayth this holie

Father) that if he ſhould but heare of the death of his deare and only ſonne, his ſtrength cannot beare the griefe of it, but he muſt preſently die: thou knowing his child is dead, and being asked of him whether he be dead or aliue; what wouldeſt thou anſwer? Thou muſt either ſay he is dead, or he liueth, or I know not: but theſe two, [he liueth, and, I know not] are both falſe; the only true is, He is dead. But thou wilt ſay, then truth ſhall be a murtherer: why? if an impudent woman ſhall ſoliicite thy chaſtity, and thou denie, ſhe in the rage of her paſſion ſhall ſhortly die: wilt thou ſay that chaſtity is a murtherer? Me thinke I heare our Aequiuocators ſay, what, no true anſwer but only he is dead? ſimple S.

                        There was a certaine Biſhop, by name Firme, but firmer by the conſtancy of his will: who being asked where the man was, whom he had hid from the hands of the perſecutor; anſwered the ſeruants and officers of the Emperour thus: I (quoth he) may neither

                           e, nor yet betray my brother: and leſt he ſhould do either, he ſuffered many torments of theſe perſecutors. What anſwer could haue beene giuen more reſolute and honeſt than this? Thus reſolueth S. Auguſtine euen vpon the caſe in queſtion: only differing heerein, that the example which the Father propoundeth, is of a Biſhop for the ſafetie of a Chriſtian; the anſwer which our Aequiuocator teacheth is eſpeciallie directed to lay-men for preſeruation of Prieſts, viz. themſelues. S. Auguſtine reſolued that the Biſhops anſwer was moſt honeſt: what wil our Aequiuocators iudge? ſurely their ſubtilty teacheth that it was moſt

ſottiſh, by ignorance of another meane of euaſion, through this backdoore of Reſeruation, [Vt tibi reuelem.] Therefore the Catholicke Biſhop might ſeeme foole-hardie to expoſe himſelfe to torments when by aequiuocation he might haue kept his knowledge as inuiſible for that time, as Chriſt did his perſon by his almighty diuine power amongſt the perſecuting Iewes. But S. Auguſtine could not finde that paſſage, becauſe it was not heard of in thoſe daies; therefore doth reſolue thus, that the anſwer of the godlie Biſhop was honeſt:

                        But the example of Rahab (ſaith he) will be obiected, whether ſhe had not done well if ſhe had not ſhewed mercy vnto her gueſts the ſeruants of God, when inquiſition was made by their enemies to know whether they were there; She might haue ſaid, I know where they be, but I feare God, and therefore will not tell you to betray them: thus ſhould ſhe haue anſwered if ſhe had beene then a true Iſraelite in whom there is no guile. But you will ſay that then they would haue ſlaine her and haue ſought out the ſtrangers: doth it therefore follow that they ſhould find them? But ſuppoſe ſhe had loſt her life, a life which muſt be loſt, yet had her death beene right deare and pretious in the eies of God, and the benefit to her gueſts had not beene in vaine. You will furthermore obiect that they by this meanes might make more diligent ſearch for her gueſts, and

haue found them out; and what I pray you, if they would not haue beleeued that leud woman? Howſoeuer, who are we that we ſhould cenſure or limit the power of God? For he that preſerued them after by this womans lie, might haue preſerued them without her lie: except we can forget his power againſt the Sodomites; they ſought the gueſts of Lot, but were ſtrucke blind, and not able to find the doore.

Interpreter of the mind, whereby he might be knowen of others: as the learned Philoſopher looking earneſtly vpon a Scholar profeſſed in all arts, Loquere, inquit, vt t

Now becauſe there is no man of ſound braines, but he knoweth before he ſpeake, what his tongue vttereth, there can be no neede that by ſpeech hee ſhould interpret his owne meaning to himſelfe, no more then a man may be properly ſaid to ſteale his owne goods, or commit adultery with his owne wife: becauſe both theſe are actions ad extra, that is, without a man, and haue relation to others then to our ſelues. Which is yet more apparant heerein, ſeeing that he cannot be ſaid properly to ſpeake vnto himſelfe, who cannot properly be ſaid to lie to himſelfe: but whoſoeuer can lie to himſelfe may alſo by ſpeech properly deceaue himſelf; becauſe a lie is deſcribed to be a falſe ſpeech, to this end, Supra. 
                           To deceiue. And can any by any wilfull lie deceiue his owneſelfe, as thereby be made ignorant of his owne meaning? This were to diſtract a man from himſelfe. Therefore this naturall reaſon taken from the ſpeech of man with himſelfe, might beſt befit a pure naturall, or ſome perſon diſtracted; namely, ſuch a one as being beſide himſelfe can beſt talke with himſelfe.

                           Eſau (as your Cardinall Caietan ſaith: Haec eſt opinio nec paucorum nec ignobilium Doctorum. Pererius Ieſ. Comm. in Gen. 27. 
                           Which is alſo the opinion of many learned Doctors) being a proper name, which Iſaac did purpoſely reſtraine to that particular perſon, ſaying, [Art thou my eldeſt ſonne Eſau?] Iaacob heerein is inexcuſable from alie.
                        
                        Secondly, your Aequiuocators doe preſcribe the vſe of this your art to be put in practiſe onely before a iudge, or hearer incompetent: and ſhall wethinke that Iſaac the bleſſed Patriarch and father of the promiſed ſeede could be an vnfit and incompetent hearer of his ſonne now only crauing his bleſſing? This Diſputer therefore (to ſpeake mildly) is incompetent; although, I muſt confeſſe, this example is very ſemblable to your perſons, in whom we heare Iaacobs diſſembling voice, but feele the rough hands of Eſau, who intended the murder of his brother.

                        You diſcern̄e nothing in the outward ſpeech of this Prophet but a lie, falſely imagining an inward aequiuocation of thought, which no man can diſcerne. But your ancient expoſitour telleth vs, that In hoc verū dixit Hieremias, alias non obediuiſſet mentiendo; & hoc patet, quia hoc quod ſuper dictū eſt, quòd Rex iurauit ei, quod non interficereteū, nec traderet eum in manus Principum, qui miſerant eum in lacum; nec eſt veriſimile quòd Rex iuraſſet de aliquo, quod Hieremias nō petiuiſſet.

                           The very outward ſpeech of Ieremy was true, as may appeare, (ſaith he) in that the King ſwore vnto him, that he would not kill him, nor deliuer him ouer into the hands of thoſe Princes.

Auguſtine and others doth imply any mentall equiuocation. And becauſe Garnet did ſelect onely S. Auguſtine

of all the Fathers, we will appeale to S. Auguſtine for anſwer to them all. By whoſe teſtimony it doth appeare, that when our Sauiour ſaid, I know not the daie, ſignifying, [vt dicam vobis;] this clauſe whereby he meant to conceale the time, was not concealed from them; who though they were by the ſenſe of the ſpeech held in ignorance not to know the day, yet were they not ignorant of the ſenſe of the ſpeech, which was, I may not let you know it. For he maketh the ſenſe of the word Neſcio, I know it not, to be a figuratiue ſpeech, and by the emphaſis of pronunciation to ſignifie ſo much to his Diſciples, as you ſhall not know. His examples.

                           When it is written Deut. 13. The Lord your God trieth you, that he may know whether ye loue him. Theſe words, [That he may know] do not ſignifie that God may receiue knowledge, who knoweth all things before they be; but the ſenſe is this, That he may make you to know how much you haue profited in his loue. So Chriſt ſpeaking to his Diſciples, ſaying, The Sonne of man knoweth not the day of iudgement, had this meaning, to make his Diſciples that they ſhould not know it. Now therefore as the people of God vnderſtood the figure of the phraſe, Vt ſciat Deus, in his id eſt, vt ſcire vos faciat: ſo did his Diſciples by circumſtance, or emphaſis of Chriſt; ſpeech vnderſtand his Neſcio, in his id eſt, vt vobis dicam, which is yet more perſpicuous by that which S. Auguſtine doth adde; Such kind of ſpeeches (ſaith this holy Father) are ordinary in the common ſpeech of men, as when we ſay, It is a pleaſant, or a drowſie day: ſignifying that the day maketh vs pleaſant, or drowſie. I would deſire the Reader to compare this Neſcio of Chriſt with S. Auguſtines Neſcio, in his Supra chap. 8. lit. 
                                 〈◊〉
                              . former example, and hee ſhall eaſily interpret S. Auguſtine by S. Auguſt, to vnderſtand that Neſcio cannot admit a concealed ſenſe. Now what man of common ſenſe doth not know the ſenſe of ſuch ſpeeches? plainly ſhewing that the Apoſtles did then know the ſenſe of that Neſcio, the day of iudgement, onely that they might not

know it. Can then your vnknowen Reſeruation haue approbation by S. Auguſtine? fie no: his Chriſtian ha

And will you make him guilty of more than Heatheniſh Aequiuocation?
                        Secondly, conſider but the vſe of your imagined Reſeruation, which you preſcribe to be then only requiſite, when the hearer is incompetent and vnfit to vnderſtand the clauſe reſerued: but ſhall any imagine, that the Apoſtles were not fit to vnderſtand (the only reaſon of your imagined Reſeruation) that they were vnfit to know the day of iudgement? ſenſeleſſe, for our Sauiour elſewhere ſaith, Act. 1. 7. 
                           It is not for you to know the times and ſeaſons. And why was not that [vt vobis ſignificem] at this time alſo ſeaſonable for them to vnderſtand? Yes doubtleſſe, if that were the meaning of his wordes, they vnderſtood it, and then it was no concealed reſeruation; if it were not his meaning, there was no aequiuocation.
                        Thirdly, the purpoſe of the Aequiuocator is by his ſecret reſeruation To delude his hearer. And will you ſay now therefore that Chriſt did aequiuocate, that is, delude and deceiue his Diſciples? This were blaſphemy.
                        Fourthly, this expoſition [Vt vobis ſignificem] is either deriued from the circumſtances of Chriſt his ſpeech, whether of time, or place, or perſons &c. Or elſe it is idlely imagined, to ſay that the Fathers doted dreaming vpon a ſenſe without light of ſome circumſtance would be iniurious to reuerend Antiquity, and prooue the ſubuerſion of your owne cauſe: but if the Fathers collected this by circumſtances and conſequents of Chriſts ſpeech, then was it not the ſenſe concealed, except you will ſay S. Auguſtine and S. Ambroſe did vnderſtand better the meaning of our Sauiour then his prime, choſen, and (concerning the tenor of Chriſts ſpeeches) his familiar Diſciples. Laſtly we will conclude

this point by the teſtimony of your Geneſius, who will tell you that this ſenſe which you conceit, is not only contrary to the ſentence of all Fathers, but alſo againſt all common ſenſe: Non ſuſtineamus hâc interpretatione nitentes. quidquam nō modò contra veterum & grauiſſimorum Doctorū conſenſum, verum-euam contra communem ſenſum, quaſilegem in vitam communem inducere.

                           Pope Gregory likewiſe and Bede (ſaith your Ieſuite) hold that Chriſt did it not to deceiue them, but rather to ſhew how they were deceiued. He cannot be ſaid to he (ſaith Gregory) who vſeth words, which are not intended to deceiue another, but to ſhew that he is deceiued, as the Prophet Michaiah dealt with Ahab. 1. Reg. 22. The ſtory is plaine: when King Ahab was bent to go to fight againſt Ramoth Gilead, all the falſe Prophets promiſed him a proſperous warfare: the King calleth for Micheas, and asketh, [Shall we go vp againſt Ramoth Gilead, or no? the Prophet anſwered, Go vp and proſ
                                 •
                              er.] When notwithſtanding he knew that the King ſhould periſh: but this was an irony, and in a ſenſe knowen to the King himſelfe, who therefore charged him to ſpeake ſeriouſly. Therefore the Prophet ſpoke theſe words now according to the meaning of the falſe Prophers in ſcorne: as When a ſicke man ſhall take water died with a red colour, which he is perſwaded to be wine, we would ſay in ieſting manner, well drinke your wine; thereby to tell him his errour, and not to cauſe him to erre: ſo here theſe diſciples not perſwaded that Chriſt was riſen from death, but held him as a ſtranger and paſſenger feined himſelfe a paſſenger to go forward. Come to the literall and hiſtoricall ſenſe. [He made as though he would go furder: and they 
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           , that is, did compell, or, conſtraine him, ſaying, Abide with vs, and he abode with them.] And now it appeareth, he meant as he ſeemed, to goe further, but after was ouercome by their curteous importunity to yeeld vnto them: as the Gen. 19. 
                           Angell of God was by the vrgent requeſt of

holy Loth: heereby teaching vs a double inſtruction: in reſpect of man not to be peruerſe, but when our occaſions may ſuffer vs to yeeld to the ſweet violence of curtuous humanity; in reſpect of God [Who loueth an importunate beggar] to be inſtant in praier, knowing that God, who in our remiſneſſe will, by withdrawing his graces, ſeeme to go from vs, yet condeſcendeth in mercy to our importunity, and will abide with vs. If therefore we conſider the figuratiue ſenſe, then in this fiction there could not be your aequiuocation, for it was done to inſtruct them, and not to deceiue them: If we imbrace the literall, then it was no fiction, but a plaine and familiar humane practiſe, as any one who departeth from his friends is truely ſaid to depart. What reaſon or religion then ſhall we call this, which thus from an action of ſenſible inſtruction, would prooue an aequiuocating diſſimulation, a reſeruation inſenſible, that is to ſay, a deceitfull deluſion: turning by this meanes the Oracle of the ſonne of God Chriſt Ieſus, authour of the truth, into the Oracle of Delphos, the profeſſed diuelliſh ſchoole of Sophiſticall aequiuocations?

                           He who ſaith he will not go vp yet, doth not denie that he will not go vp at all, and therefore going ap afterwards, that act doth not contradict his former ſpeech, and ſo all doubt and queſtion is eaſily aſſoiled.

                           Gregory doth in that place (ſaith he) reproue a quarreller, who knowing the ſimple meaning of him, with whom he doth contend, yet maliciouſly doth wreſt his words: And thus do the moſt learned expound S. Gregory. This kind of example we reade of in our Stories: An Inne-keeper in London at the ſigne of the Crowne, to incourage his ſonne to learning, would vſually ſay, Learne faſt, child, and I will make thee heire of the crowne. One peruerſly taking aduantage of the ambiguity and double ſenſe of the phraſe, heire of the crowne, brought him in queſtion of high Treaſon, & the poore Inne-keeper (as I take it) loſt both his artificiall and naturall Inne. Here was place for S. Auguſtine his moderation not captiouſly to catch at mens doubtfull words, where we are not ignorant of their ſimple meaning. The like I haue heard of a Miniſter called in queſtion of periurie, becauſe he had ſworne that N. was poſſeſſed of a leaſe, as it might be the 13. day of May. It appeared, indeed, that vpon the ſame day the ſaid leaſe was deliuered to the forenamed N. according to this forme of law, To hold from the day of the date heereof. O ſir, (ſaith a Lawyer) you are now conuicted for a notorious periurer; for theſe words From the day &c. are vnderſtood excluſiuely, ſignifying after that day, and that the leaſe was not in force till the next day. Seeing then (ſaith the Miniſter) both law and Lawyers faile, I muſt beſeech your honours to giue me leaue to ſhew the ſimplicity of my meaning in a caſe of like tenor; leaue was granted him to plead his owne cauſe: thus then (quoth he) when any in this honourable aſſembly was married after this forme, To haue and to hold from this day forward; whether were they man and wife before the next day, or no? If they had ſaid no, they ſhould haue ſtained their firſt-borne; and, affirming it, they were forced to acknowledge the ſimplicity of his meaning, and remit the rigour and extremity of the law. Haue you no Father

You thought, belike, that if you muſt haue an authour for a lie, it was moſt likely he ſhould be a Pope. But you muſt then make choiſe of ſome other, than S. Gregory, who I am ſure) as Popedom is now defined) was nothing leſſe than a Pope.

                        It is a dutifull act of religion, whereby we profeſſe God to be the authour of all trueth; who can neither deceiue, nor be deceiued. Hence may we reaſon thus: The competencie of God, by whom we ſweare, maketh euery one competent Iudges and hearers, to whom we ſweare: but by ſwearing by God, whom we can not deceiue, we religiouſly proteſt that we in ſwearing intend not to deceiue. Ergo our deceitful aequiuocating is a profanation of the religious worſhip of God.
                     The Maior is true, for that our Sauiour in auouching trueth, held Pilate a competent Iudge, although he did not Iuridicè, but falſly proceed. S. Paul in his cauſe appealed to Caeſars tribunall ſeat, who was a Pagan. Iacob did couenant with Laban an Idolater: and the maid, to whom S. Peter ſwore, was competent enough to heare a true oath, if he had been as ready to ſweare truly: and yet neither the maid, not that Iudge did proceed turidice; for ſhe was no lawfull Examiner, and he was a partiall Iudge.

                     HEb. 4. An oath is for confirmation, to make an end of all contention. This Maior is Scripture. (Minor.) But in an aequiuocating oath there is neither beginning of confirmation, nor end of contention. Ergo it is a vaine and ſacrilegious oath.

                           For further direction of the partie examined, let him admit the oth with a ſecret intētion of aequiuocation, & if he be more vrged to ſweare without aequiuocating, let him ſweare that alſo (namely that he doth not aequiuocate) but with the forſaid intention of aequiuocation. What ſhould the Diſciple of Chriſt ſay to this Doctour, though he ſate in Peters chaire? What, but as our Lord Chriſt taught by his example, who in the fauourable temptation to do euill for ſecurity of his life, anſwered,

                           Math. 16. 23 
                           Get thee behind me Satan: for this is the mouth of Satan, to ſweare by an aequiuocation. We do not aequiuocate; and vrged againe to ſweare this without aequiuocation, to ſweare aequiuocatingly we doe not aequiuocate. &c. Heere is contention without end, by this aequiuocation which is as bottomleſſe as the pit of hell.

                           Whoſoeuer (ſaith your Azorius) is rightly catechized in this point of religion concerning an oath, calleth God to witneſſe of the truth, and therefore it is an heatheniſh impiety not to beleeue Chriſtians thus ſwearing. Say now, you Aequiuocators, who ſweare Sophiſtically, turning Supra.

That doctrine which is leſſe honeſt then the doctrine of Pagans, is intolerable among Chriſtians: (Minor) but Ieſuiticall aequiuocating is leſſe honeſt than the doctrine of Infidels and Pagans. Ergo, ought to be eſteemed abhominable among Chriſtians. The Maior is taught by our Sauiour: Matth. 5. 20. 
                        Except your righteouſneſſe exceed the righteouſneſſe of the Scribes and Phariſies, you ſhall not enter, &c. ſhewing where there is more knowledge of Chriſt, there the profeſſion muſt be more honeſt. And more expreſly S. Paul: 1. Cor. 5. 1.

                        Some of you, who thinke that a Priſoner vniuſtly detained vpon his oath is bound to returne, except he be abſolued from his oath by a Biſhop. This in an oath without aequiuocation: but our Aequiuocators thinke their Aequiuocation in making an oath better, and of more power than any Biſhop to free them from periurie in an oath; eſteeming it as good as no oath wherein they vſe their Reſeruation: when as yet the very Infidels in reſpect of their naturall knowledge of God, kept better fidelity among men.

                           Vnus ex decem illis captiuis, &c. Cicero Offic. lib. 3. §. Regulus. 
                           There was a man, who together with nine other priſoners being diſmiſſed out of the priſon of Carthage, vpon his oath, that he within a prefixed time ſhould returne againe: aſſoone as he was out of priſon, he returned as though he had forgot ſome thing, by and by departeth home to Rome, where he ſtayed beyond the time appointed, anſwering that he was freed from his oath. See now the opinion of his owne countreyman concerning this aequiuocation of Returne;

                           Non rectè (ſayth Tully) this was not well done: for craft in an oath doth not leſſen but make the periury more heinous: wherfore the graue Senators of Rome ſent this couſening mate bound, with cords, againe to the priſon of Annibal their enemie, from whom he had eſcaped. 
                           Qui verò dcunt nullam eſſe ſidem, quae Infideli data ſit, videant ne quaeratur latebra periurio; quiduis enim potiùs argutè excuſari poſſit quam iuſiurandu: quantum enim mali excidit ex ipſa fraude? Cic. ibid.

This was the honeſtie of the ancient Heatheniſh Rome, which muſt riſe vp in iudgement againſt this preſent Rome to condemne it, which hath changed that faithfull Romanam in Punicam fidem.

                        who being compelled by the holy Emperour Conſtantine to deliuer his ſubſcription to the Councell of Nice, and to auouch his integritie by an oath, he vſed this art and ſleight: his owne (hereticall) opinion he cloſely kept vnder his left arme, and then ſwore (laying his hand vpon his left ſide) that he ſo beleeued as he had written. What can be the difference betwixt the oath of our Aequiuocators, and of this blaſphemous Arius? He kept ſecret his aequiuocation vnder the hollow of his arme, but theſe conceale theirs in the hollow of their hearts.
                     
                        An Obiection remoued.
                        You peraduenture will inſiſt and ſay, that Arius did aequiuocate in the cauſe of faith, which all Chriſtians holde a thing moſt abominable: but firſt know, that although the matter of deceitfull ſwearing may make the deceit to be more wicked, yet it can not make the wickedneſſe to be more deceitfull; for euery thing is defined by his forme, and not by his matter, Vero nihil verius, and ſo on the contrary: for example, to ſay the mouſe worried a cat, and to ſay adulterie is no ſinne, this latter is not the greater lie; yet by reaſon of the matter is the greater ſinne, becauſe beſides the wickedneſſe of lying, it doth iuſtifie (another wickedneſſe) adulterie. Now to the matter.
                        
                           
You will aequiuocate in the queſtion concerning your Prieſthood, ſaying and ſwearing againſt your knowledge that you are no Prieſt, by ſome ſecret reſeruation of minde; as according to the example of one of your fellowes, I am no Prieſt; meaning, No Prieſt [Apollonis]: as though an aequiuocating Prieſt can conſort with any better than with thoſe Satanicall Prieſts of the Pagan god Apollo. For all their anſwers (as euery ſcholar knoweth) from their Oracles was by Amphibologies and Aequiuocations. Of many, be you contented with this one. Pyrrhus his queſtion to that Oracle was; Whether he ſhould giue an ouerthrow to the Romans, or no: the anſwer of the Oracle was this:

                              Aio te Aetacidi Romanos vincere poſſe;
                           
That is to ſay,

                              I ſay that Pyrrhus the Romans may ouercome.
                           
So whether the Romans (which after was true) ſhould ouercome Pyrrhus, or Pyrrhus (which was falſe) ſhould conquer the Romans, the aequiuocating Oracle might be found to haue ſayd trueth. It is recorded by Euſeb. Prapar. Euang. Euſebius, that at the birth of Chriſt all thoſe diuelliſh aequiuocating Oracles were put to ſilence: when the laſt which ſpoke, being asked Why they now ceaſed to giue anſwers; returned this laſt anſwer; 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           . Becauſe the Hebrew babe (meaning Chriſt) is borne. So doubtleſſe, in what heart ſoeuer there is the regenerating ſpirit of Chriſt, there the aequiuocating ſpirit of Delphos doth wax dumbe.
                        Now you holde, that your Prieſthood is conferred vpon you by a Sacrament of Ordination; and that Bellar. lib. 2. de effect. Sacram. in genere. 
                           Ex opere operato it doth impreſſe in your ſoules Charactêrem indelebilem, that is, a marke neuer to be blotted out. 
                           Ordo praeſtat caeteris omnib' quoad hoc, quia conſtituit homines in gradu ſublimiori, quàm ſunt caeteri Chriſtiani. Bellar. quo ſupra cap. 28. §. Ordo. 
                           By the power of that Sacrament of Order, which heerein (ſay you) excelleth all other Sacraments, that it aduanceth Prieſts a degree aboue all other Chriſtians. The end thereof you beleeue is Tooffer ſacrifice for the ſinnes of the quicke and the dead. Yet do you aequiuocatingly denie your Prieſthood ſealed vnto you by a Sacrament belonging to faith. And what matter can there be wherein ſuch a Prieſt will not aequiuocate, who doth aequiuocate

concerning his Prieſthood? But we haue not ſo learned Chriſt, but defend that it is eſſentiall to a Chriſtian, whenſoeuer or to whomſoeuer he ſweareth, to vſe ſimplicitie, and not to ſophiſticate: for there is a double faith in the Iurer to be tendred; the firſt is faith to the man, to whom he ſweareth, which we call fideline: the other is our faith in God, by whom he ſweareth, to beleeue that he is omnipotently wiſe, to diſcerne whether my words be true according to their ſignification, and omnipotently iuſt to take vengeance vpon me, if I do diſſemble. The firſt faith is violated by aequiuocating; for it is therefore interpreted to be called Cic. in Offic. lib. 1. & S. Auguſt. lib. de Mendacio. cap. 20. 
                           Fides, quia fit quod dicitur, that is, The thing is, as it is ſayd to be. And the diſſemble

                           There are three kinds of lies (that one Ieſuite may ſpeake for all his fellowes) one is a pernicious and hurtfull lie, which turneth to the hurt of another; the ſecond is an officious and charitable lie, which is for the good of another; the third is but a ieſting

                        The Anſwer.
                        I am not ignorant that the vſe of this diſtinction of mortall and veniall, in the compariſon of ſinnes, is frequent in the Fathers, but as different from you in ſenſe, as they be conſonant in termes: for they neuer valued any ſinne ſo veniall in his owne nature, as not to deſerue of it ſelfe an infinite eternall torment: for they alwaies taught that euery ſinne being

a tranſgreſſion of an eternall law of the infinitely iuſt God, doth challenge an infinit puniſhment, & ſo to be accounted mortall: and yet not therefore equall, except you will ſay that theft and murder and blaſphemy againſt God be therefore equall, becauſe they be equally mortall: which I thinke you will not. But when they conſider man in the ſtate of Grace, they taught that the ſinnes of humane infirmity in a man regenerate are not rigorouſly exacted: and in this ſenſe are called veniall. Notwithſtanding I dare affirm, that of theſe kinds of ſinnes which you call veniall, there is not one but being done vpon preſumption, it is damnable & equall with your mortall: As thus; ſuppoſe your officious lie be vnto the examined veniall, becauſe he was inſtantly ſurpriſed (as it were) with a ſudden paſſion, and not able to know how to reſolue, which I call infirmity: yet if he had 
                              ••
                           ed preſumptuouſly, that is, beene of this reſolution, that whenſoeuer ſuch a caſe ſhould happen, his purpoſe was to lie, this vnto that man had beene a ſinne grieuouſly mortall: yet this manner of reſolution in like caſe is your generall doctrine, and practiſe. Therefore we muſt ſhew that
                     
                     
                        Euery Officious lie, for what good intent ſoeuer it be, reſolutely done, whether in, or without an oath, is damnable in it ſelfe, and ought to be auoided of all Chriſtians.
                        Your practiſe in the popular opinion is iuſtified in theſe reſpects; We doe it for a good end, as to ſecure our ſelues, or a Prieſt; and for the Catholike cauſe, leſt holy Prieſthood might be defamed, and our Catholike faith blaſphemed. Haue you ſayd? Then ſee, I pray you, how much Chriſtian ſimplicitie doth abhorre this infatuation?

                        Now becauſe by experience in reading your beſt authors I haue obſerued that the Romiſh Church hath beene bold often to publiſh to the world lying Reuelations, lying Miracles, lying Priuiledges, lying Legends, and Stories, Slanders, and other lying Reports: All which I am as able particularly to ſhew as to name, and would alſo if it were not impertinent in this Treatiſe; and it may be ſome moderate anſwerer, will by ſomeidle Reioinder heereafter extort them: Seeing alſo that your Superiors both ſecular and Ieſuitical haue autoriſed this art of lying, and that all ſuch conceits are eſteemed with them but as piae fraudes, godly deceits: as though the euill of them [Deceit] were veniall, and not ſo only, but becauſe it is mixed with [Godly] that is, [with a good intent] it becommeth alſo meritorious:
                        I muſt entreat patience of the gentle Reader, to peruſe a Chriſtian reaſon, able to ouerthrow a thouſand ſuch Antichriſtian and heatheniſh profanations. For it is written Rom. 13. 7. If the verity of God haue more abounded through my lie vnto his glory, why do we not euill that good may come thereof? as ſome affirme we do ſay, whoſe damnation is iuſt. The argument of the Apoſtle is this: though it be moſt true in the verity of God, that mans vnrighteouſneſſe, (as for example a lie) doth redound to the glory of Gods grace in pardoning of the ſame vnrighteouſneſſe of man by Ieſus Chriſt, according to that verity of the Goſpell of remiſſion of ſin: yet God forbid that any man ſhould therfore multiply vnrighteouſneſſe in ſinning (as for example lying) that Gods glorie may be magnified in forgiuing! Shewing that it were blaſphemie to teach that it is lawfull for any to lie, although it would eſtabliſh and aduance the glorie of God in that wherein God ſo loued ye world that he gaue his only begotten ſonne. Ioh. 3. 16. God is moſt glorified, euen the glory of his grace in pardoning of ſinne by Chriſt Ieſus. And therefore the Romiſh godleſſe deceits, muſt be bundled vp with thoſe condemned

Doubtleſſe; becauſe God is truth: but no man will defend any thing, no not a lie, but he wil defend it in the name of truth: for who will ſay I lie; therfore it is true? Can then any without blaſphemy defend the cauſe of the God of all iuſtice and truth with a lie?

                              2. Challengeth all Romiſh Prieſts and their adherents in this kingdome to the racke.
                              3. Gaineth the infamie of deceit and lying vpon the profeſſed Aequiuocators.
                              4. Begetteth ſcandall to ſoules, blaſphemies againſt Chriſt in the profeſſion of the holy faith.
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        The firſt.
                        THe laſt anchor that man can caſt for any ſecurity in this tumultuous and tempeſtuous world, in any Common-wealth,

is an oath: for mans name, goods, lands, and life, whenſoeuer they be formally called in queſtion, doe all in the end depend vpon the preſumption of the teſtimony of witneſſes in the trueth of their oath; and in one word, for the Heb. 4. 
                           end of all contentions, the laſt linke of confirmation, is ordeined an oath. For preſeruation therefore of the integritie of an oath, all Nations haue prouided puniſhments for all ſuch as wilfully tranſgreſſe therein; ſome countries adiudging the periured to be whipped; others to be hanged; others to be ſlit in the noſe; others to be branded in the forhead: and the iudiciall law of God doth command Deut. 19. 
                           legem talionis; that euery falſe witneſſe ſhould ſuffer that euill or loſſe, which by his falſe ſwearing he would haue brought vpon another; eye for eye, hand for hand, life for life. And in all the kingdomes of the world, from all generations, the offence in an oath is called Periurie; Ieſuits ſupra. 
                           which is a lie in an oath. But if the ſecret intention might excuſe from lying, then could neuer any haue beene iuſtly condemned for periury or falſe witneſſe. Thus the falſe witneſſes ſuborned againſt 1. King. 21. 
                           Naboth, the falſe witneſſes againſt chaſte Hiſt. of Suſanna. 
                           Suſanna, the witneſſes againſt Matt. 26. 60. 
                           Christ the iuſt one, euen the only iuſt, might each one haue iuſtified themſelues, ſaying, We ſpoke trueth, for we did aequiuocate. And thus all humane lawes againſt periury muſt haue beene aboliſhed.
                     
                     
                        The ſecond effect which muſt moue the Aequiuocators to giue ouer this art, is extremity againſt their owne bodies.
                        Becauſe they, who by their aequiuocating do profeſſe to conceale moſt deſperate treaſons, till they come to be tortured, do neceſſarily challenge the racke: but all Romiſh Prieſts and their diſciples are inſtructed not to reueale any of their ſect to be guilty of ſuch practiſes, till they be inforced by the torture: for thus your Cardinall in his inſtructions of Prieſts, hath determined, Quandò aliquis in tortura poſitus reuelat alterius peccatum verè, quandò non interrogatur iuridicè, non peccat: ratio, quia nullus tenetur cum tanto ſuo detrimento conſeruare famam alterius, occultando crimen commiſſum illius.

put vpon the racke, and doth truly reueale the crime of another, although he be not examined iuridicè, iuſtly, and according to the order of law; yet therein he doth not ſinne, becauſe none is bound, vpon ſo great bodily harme to himſelfe, to preſerue the good name of another, by concealing his offence. Therefore when you make all Proteſtant-magiſtrates incompetent, with whom you may vſe aequiuocation till you come to be tortured, what do you els but teach them, that your only competent Iudge and Examiner muſt be a Racke?
                     
                     
                        The third is infamie againſt the Aequiuocators good name and faith among men.

                           anſwering your incompetent magiſtrate by aequiuocation; if he ſhall further aske whether you doe not aequiuocate, to anſwer, No; but with another aequiuocation: If againe, in his ielouſie, he vrge whether this third time you doe not aequiuocate; then the third time alſo to ſay, No, but with another ſecret aequiuocation; and ſo as often as he ſhall aske the like: likewiſe by aequiuocating to ſay you doe not aequiuocate. This is that monſter which I called Hydra, which, as Poets faine, Hercules did impugne; in the which as often as one head was ſtrucke off, immediatly there ſprung vp another; ſignifying an endleſſe buſineſſe.

                           on. But in your Aequiuocating by a clauſe reſerued and concealed in your thought, (which God onely, Pſal. 7. 10. 
                           The only ſearcher of the heart ſeeth) no man can diſcerne in your ſpeech any thing but apparance of damnable lying. Therefore not only Pagans by this ſcandall ſhall continue in infidelity, but the glorious name of Chriſt and his true religion, ſhall ſuffer blaſphemie: and if this do follow vpon the examples of wicked ſeruants, wicked wiues, wicked children; how much more by the principal profeſſors, wicked Prieſts?
                        Neither this onely, but by this doctrine the Goſpell of Chriſt, in the opinion of all Pagans, will be more iuſtly condemned, when the Pagan ſhall not onely examine the moſt godly Chriſtian religion by a wicked Profeſſour, as it were a right rule by a crooked example, or Chriſt by Iudas (which is wicked) but as the rule in it ſelfe, that is, the Religion in his moral truth, & find that this your doctrine of aequiuocation

is non ſolum doctrina mendax, verum-etiam mendacij; not only a lying doctrine, but a doctrine of lying. What can this worke in the Turks & all Pagans at this day, but obſtinacy in their infidelity, and blaſphemy of that faith, which is the only life of ſoules? Eſpecially ſeeing I may as iuſtly ſay concerning the Aequiuocation of your contagious Romiſts, as the bleſſed Apoſtle writ of the inceſtuous among the Corinthians: 1. Cor. 5. 1. 
                           I heare that there is ſuch fornication among you, as is not once named among the Heathen.
                        
                     
                     
                        This our Apoſtolicall Defence of Proteſtants I will conclude from Proteſtations of the Apoſtle.
                        The bleſſed Apoſtle of the Genules, and elect veſſell of grace, S. Paul, when he would auouch his inward zeale for the ſaluation of ſoules, he proteſteth thus; Rom. 9. 1. 
                           I ſay the truth and lie not, my conſcience bearing me witneſſe that I haue continuall ſorrow of hart for you. And againe, 2. Cor. 11. 31. 
                           God the father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt knoweth that I lie not. Secondly, to perſwade to others the authority of his Apoſtleſhip, he proteſteth thus; 1. Tim. 2. 7. 
                           Whereunto I am ordained an Apoſtle; I ſpeake the truth in Chriſt, and lie not, euen a Teacher of the Gentiles. And againe, Galat. 1. 20. 
                           This that I write vnto you, behold I witneſſe before God and lie not. He would then confirme vnto the minds of the Romans, Corinthians, Galathians the ſincerity both of his affection and function by the force of an oath; calling God to witneſſe to his words, as directly proceeding from his conſcience; otherwiſe theſe Conuerts might haue replied vpon the Apoſtle thus; We heare of a doctrine of Aequiuocating, which teacheth that you, by a ſecret clauſe in your mind, may alter the ſenſe of words in your vnderſtanding; differing from the ſenſe which outwardly they ſignifie, and which only we can poſſibly vnderſtand. How can you then perſwade vs in this ſenſe, that, you are an Apoſtle, ſeeing you profeſſe a reſeruation of a contrary ſenſe, which may ſignifie

                           you are no Apoſtle? Would you perſwade vs to beleeue that by that your proteſtation, which you teach we need not beleeue by your reſeruation? therefore it will be to no end to perſwade vs to beleeue you in that wherein we may be deceiued. Otherwiſe, if by the outward ſenſe you may confirme vs that you doe not lie, the contrary aequiuocating ſenſe, doubtleſſe, muſt be accounted a plaine lie. And yet our Aequiuocators haue made as ſtrong proteſtations to deny their Prieſthood, as euer S. Paul did to confirme his Apoſtleſhip; theſe being as certainly no true Prieſts, as he was truely an Apoſtle.

Theſe be Ieſuits, the new Theologicall Alchymiſts of our time, able to abſtract Aurum ex carbone, Truth out of a lie: who muſt be admired of the world as the Monopoliſts of all Arts, whereas no Art is ſingular in them but this Aequiuocation. In reſpect whereof I may ſay of them, as Tully ſpoke of the Soothſayers of his time: Miror ſi non riſerit Haruſpex, cùm Haruſpicem viderit; I maruell how our Aequiuocatours doe not laugh, when they beholde one another. But heere is the difference of the ſpirit of wit, and the ſpirit of grace: this with that woman may looke vp to heauen and call Ieſus to witneſſe, when he that is in heauen, ſhall looke vpon them and haue them in deriſion.
                        
                        
                           
Thus haue I diſcuſſed of theſe Antichriſtian doctrines of lying and treaſon; the laſt triall of both which we referre to the iudgement of God, not as wood or ſtraw, ſubiect to their fancied Purgatory fire of triall; but as pitch and tarre, ſulphure, and powder reſerued for the vnquenchable fire of hell; From whence our Lord Ieſus preſerue vs and them, to the glory of his ſauing grace.
