Wherein is manifestly proued, that the Soueraignty of Kings is immediatly from God, and second to no authority on Earth whatsoeuer.

            TO THE RIGHT REuerend Father in God, THOMAS Lord Byshop of LONDON, my Honourable good Lord: all Grace, Prosperity, and Happinesse.
            
               THE manifolde and waighty Ecclesiasticall affaires, wherein your Lordshippe is daily imployed, and many times wearied; partly in aduancing the sincere profession of Gods holy truth, and partly in maintaining the happy tranquility of this most renowned Church, haue often occasioned me to remember the words, & complaint of that learned father S. Augustin. Though besides those Innumerabiles Ecclesiasticas curas. Aug. lib. de oper. Monac. ca. 29. innumerable Ecclesiasticall cares which hee sustained, and of which he said, that almost none would beleeue them, but such as had experience of them, he was daily incumbred also with the iudiciall hearing of verie many secular causes, for which as he saith, Non de auro non de argento, non de fundis &

as being desidious, and like the Pharisees, tying heauie burthens on other mens shoulders, which themselues would not touch with their litle fingers (& who can possibly escape that censure, if the indefatigable industry & toile of S. Augustine could not quit him thereof?) He then with a most serious and solemne protestation answered, Aug l. de oper Monac. cap. 29. I call Iesus Christ to witnesse vpon my soule, that I had much rather giue my selfe to reading, praying, and other spirituall exercises, yea to daily handy-workes, then indure the most tumultuous perplexities of other mens causes about their secular businesses, either (Vel i

                  dicando dirimendis, vel interueniendo praecidendis. ibid.) iudicially to end them or by perswasion to preuent them.
            The cogitation heereof, had almost perswaded me not to withdraw your Lordshippe, so much as to the viewe of these my slender labours, but that the seuerall bandes of duty which I owe vnto your Lordship, ouer-swayed with me heerein at the last. For hauing not onely beene called (as from little Zoar to Ierusalem) by that message which to me was no other then the voice of God, though some younger Samuels, may perhappes mistake it to bee Elias voice; but further also in that straitnesse of time, extraordinarily encouraged by your Lordship to this seruice; the fruit of my labours therein (if it be any) I iudged it my duty to present to him, by whose Authoritie and appointment they were first vndertaken.
            Againe, seeing my heartie and sincere desire heerein, was to testifie my vnfaigned loue, first to Gods truth, and then to the peace of our Ierusalem, in both which, I expect no lesse then the seuerest censures of two, in themselues opposite, and both of them very rigorous aduersaries, who contrary to the Apostles Ephes. 4, 15. rule, either follow not the truth, or follow it not in loue: I was emboldened in both these to

intreat protection vnder your Lordships name, as one who liuing vnder your Lordships, both publicke and Domesticall gouernment, haue, and do daily see manie assured experiments of your Lordships zeal to the one, and prudence ioyned with great moderation in the other.
            Besides, I must and do with thankefulnes acknowledge, which I haue often heeretofore gladlie recounted, a good part of that light with which God hath in mercie vouchsafed vnto me, to haue bin receiued frō that faire burning lamp, which many years in our Vniuersitie, your L. verie often and happilie helde forth vnto vs: then especiallie, when in the last yeares of our late Soueraigne, & in those, as some thought, declining daies; wherein the children of Babylon, vpon some vainly conceiued hopes, I know not what, began somwhat insolently to insult. At which most needfull time it cannot bee forgotten, how the religious, constant & godly zeal of your L. being one most eminent in that place, did animate & incourage many others, my selfe among the rest, who then sat at the feet of Gamaliel, and who by those words vttered in fittest time, by the tongue of the learned, found in our selues, how truly the Wiseman saide, Eccles. 12, 11 The words of the wise are like goads, and like nailes fastned by the maisters of the assemblies.
            If in these respectes I present this small pledge of my dutie, to your Lordshippe, and with a willing heart offer this mite vnto the Lords Treasury, let me in excuse of the slendernesse thereof, vse those fit words of S. Ierom.

               Verse 5.
               ANd shee saide to the King, It was a true word, which I heard in my owne Land of thy sayings, and of thy wisedome.
               6.
               Howbeit, I beleeued not their report, vntill I came, and mine eyes had seene it: & behold, the one halfe of thy great wisedome was not tolde mee, for thou exceedest the Fame that I heard.
               7.
               Happy are thy men, and happy are thy Seruants, which stand before thee alway, and heare thy wisedome.
               8.
               Blessed bee the Lord thy God, which loued thee, to set thee on his throne, as King, in stead of the Lorde thy God: because thy God loucth Israell, to establish it for euer, therefore hath he made thee King ouer them, to execute Iudgement and Iustice.
               9.
               Then she gaue the King six score Talents of Gold, and of sweet Odours exceeding much, and precious stones.
            
            
               THe solemnity of this most ioyfull day, and happy opportunity which God hath giuen vs to celebrate the same, to the glory of his holy name, to the honour of our most Religious Soueraigne, to the comfort of vs and all his loyall Subiectes, but to the confusion of those sonnes of Beliall, who hauing euill will at Sion, repine and pine away, to see the peace and

prosperity of this most flourishing church and kingdome, and to heare of the myrth and melodie in our streets this day, hath mooued me to make choice of these wordes of the Queene of Sheba to King Salomon; wherein euery one may see both a fit correspondence to our Salomon, and a woorthy example of that loue wee all owe to him, and thankesgiuing vnto God, for this so great, and so incstimable a blessing.
            In the wordes themselues, not to seeke any curious diuision (which in an History you will not expect) obserue I pray you with me, foure seuerall pointes, which concerne foure seuerall parties.
            The first, concernes King Salomon; wherein is set downe a singuler commendation of his wisedome, which exceeded all reports. [Behold the one halfe, &c.]
            The second, concernes the people and Subiects of King Salomon; wherein is declared their blessed and happy estate, who had Salomon a wise King to rule 
                  •…
               uer them. [Happy are thy seruants.]
            The third, concernes Almighty God, wherein is expressed a most Religious thankesgiuing vnto him, for placing Salomon, a wise King ouer his people. [Bl
                     •…
                  ssed bee the Lord thy God.]
            In which third point, besides many other, two particular branches are especially to be considered: the former, from whom Salomon had or held his kingdome, and that was immediately from God, who made him King ouer Israel, and placed him in his owne throne, and in his owne stead. [To set thee on his throne.]
            The latter, what moued or induced God, to graunt his people so wise a King; no merrits nor deserts, eyther of King or people, but onely his owne fauour and free loue to Israell. [Because thy God loueth Israell.]
            The fourth and last point, concernes the Queene of Sheba; wherein is set forth, a manifest and outward testification of the honour and honourable respect shee bare toward King Salomon, in token whereof, s
                  •…
               e bestowed on

him such royall and magnificent presents: six score talents of Gold, sweete Odours, and Precious stones. [Then shee gaue the King.]
            Of these seuerall pointes, by the most gracious and helpefull assistance of Gods holy spirit, and by your Honourable and wonted patience and attention, wee are at this time (God willing) to intreat.
            The first point, concernes the admirable, & (indeed) inexplicable wisedome of King Salomon, whereof God himselfe is a most sufficient witnesse. Wisedome and knowledge is granted vnto thee, so that there hath not bin the like among the Kings which were before thee, neither after thee shall th

               he excelled all the Kinges of the earth in wisedome, 1. Kings, 4. verse 29, 31. To goe no further then my Text, So famous was he for wisedome among all Nations, that there 
               1. Kings. 4. 34. 
               came of all people vnto him, and all 
               2. Chron. 9, 23. 
               Kinges of the earth sought to heare the wisedome of Salomon, which God had put into his hart. And though Fame bee not onely a swift messenger, but vsually an amplifier & multiplier of that which it doth report, as Saint Hierō
                saith, Hier.

               ijdem authores, & exaggeratores, yet in this it was quite contrary. The report of this wisedome was such, that it seemed incredible; and therefore this Queene confesseth she belieued it not: but when she had heard it her selfe, and bin an eye and eare-witnesse of all, as one amazed and astonished thereat, she breakes into this admiration thereof, set downe in my Text. Behold, the one halfe of thy great wisdome was not told mee, thou exceedest the Fame that I heard.
            
            Hauing spoken this of the wisedome of King Salomon, may I now presume to speake a word or two of the sacred Maiesty of my dread Soueraigne? It is not my purpose to make any paralell to Salomon, of whom God himselfe hath saide, that none should be like vnto him: nor take vppon me to set forth vnto you, any portraiture of that wisedom, which no Zeuxes nor Apelles can otherwise expresse, but

onely, by drawing ouer it the vaile or Curtaine of Timanthu
                     •…
                  , to import, it cannot be expressed. The wisedome of a man, much more of a King, is compared by Gods spirit, Prou. 18▪ 4. 
               to deepe waters, and to a flowing riuer: who am I, to diue into that bottomelesse depth, or with my span to measure the depth and bredth of the maine Ocean?
            Yet with all loyall submission, let mee thus much say, and say much lesse then I do conceiue: Neither can this present age, nor al the Chronicles (I say) not of great Brittaine onely, but of all Europe, present vnto vs a King, indued with such admirable gifts of Learning, Iudgement, and Memory; adorned with so many princely and Heroicall Vertues, Iustice, Clemency, and Wisedome; especially, with that Diuine and Heauenly wisedome, which is the Fountaine and foundation of all the rest; with Religion, Piety, Zeale, and constant Magnanimity to professe, maintaine, and vphold the truth of God, and of his Gospell.
            Which report of mine, if any suppose to be too lauish, and with this Queene of Sheba beleeue it not, let him well consider, those many, and most Religiously wise speeches, vttered in a manner in the hearing of the whole Realme: Conferences, Disputations, free Monarchies, but specially, that most learned Apologie, for the Oath of Allegiance against the Popes two Breues, and that kingly gift, fit onely for a peerelesse King, to giue to a peerelesse Prince; all which are but some few sparkes of that euerburning Lampe, or but small streames, of that euer and ouer-flowing spring, and then hee will bee forced euen with admiration, to professe and say with this Queene, as after the hearing and reading of diuers of them, my selfe with many others, haue often said, It was a true word indeed which I h
                     •…
                  ard of thy sayings, and of thy wisedome; howbeit I beleeued it not, vntill I came, and mine eies had seene it: and beholde, the one halfe of thy great wisedome was not told mee, for thou exceedest the fame that I heard. With which true Testimonie of the wisedoms of both these Salomons, I end this first point,

which concernes the King, and the admiration of his great wisedome.
            The second point concernes the people and subiects of King Salomon, of whom the Queene heere saith, that they were blessed & happy, who had Salomon a wise king, to rule ouer them. Happy are thy people, and happie are thy Seruants.
            
            Nor can there in truth be a greater comfort to any people, or greater safety to any kingdome, then to be gouerned by a wise and prudent King: By a man of vnderstanding and knowledge, a Realme indureth long. Prou. 28, 2. A wise man (much more a wise King) is as a fortresse and strong piller, to support euen an whole Realme: And better is wisedome, then weapons of warre. Eccles. 9, 28. Nay, a wise King, is not onely a safety, but euen an happinesse (as the Queene heere saith) to a kingdom, for so God himselfe doth witnesse. Eccl. 10, 17. Blessed art thou, ô Land, when thy King is the sonne of Nobles, that is by the Hebrew 
               Filij sapientiae i. sapientes. Mat. 11. 19, Filij hominum, i. homines. Mar. 3, 28. sic 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   Achinos vocat Homerus. phrase, truely Noble, indued with Vertue, Piety and Wisedome, wherein alone consists true Nobility.
            On the contrary, a foolish or childish king, is one of those heauy Iudgements and curses, which God in his wrath threatens to bring vpon a land. I wil appoint children to bee their Princes, and Babes shall rule ouer them. Isay 3, 4. And againe: Woe vnto thee (ô Land) whose King is a child, a child in knowledge, in wisedome, in vnderstanding. Ecclesiastes. 10, 16.
            The reason of both which, is very euident. A Wise King, gouernes with Iustice and Equity, and the Kinges Throne is established by righteousnesse. Prouerbes 25, 5. And the King that iudgeth in Truth, his Throne shall bee established for euer. Prou. 29, 14.
            Againe, a prudent and wise King, as he maintaines Iustice, so his principall and chiefe care is, to maintaine and aduance piety and godlinesse, the true & sincere worship of God throughout all his kingdomes. So did holy Dauid, of whom it is said, Psal. 78. 72. 
               that he ruled thy people prudently with all his power. And wherein did his prudence appeare? he was no
               
               sooner set vpon the throne, but he assembled all the congregation of Israel, and they brought againe the Arke of the Lord, with singing and dauncing; with Vyols, with Cimbals, and with Trumpets, 1. Chron. 13, verse 2, and 8. The like did that most religious and wise King Iosiah, He made a Couenant before all the people, to walke after the Lord, and to keepe his Commandements; and be caused all that were found in Ierusalem and Beniamin to stand to that couenant, and he compelled all that were found in Israel, to serue the Lord. Whereupon it followed, that all the daies of Iosiah, the people turned not backe from the Lord. 2. Chron. 34, ver. 31, 32, 33. Such a blessing the Church and the whole kingdome hath, of a Prudent, Religious, and wise King.
            On the other side, an irreligious, a wicked and vnwise King or Gouernor, by suppressing Iustice and equity, and making his Lust a Law; impiously saying with the Donatists, 
               August. lib. 2. cont. Epist. Parmē. cap. 12

               Caracalla, Si libet, licet; what I list, thats a Law: Such an one is euen a trouble to the whole land, and to his owne people, as Eliah said to King Ahab, 1. Kings 18, 18. Thou and thy fathers house trouble Israel, in that you haue forsaken the commandements of the Lord: Nor onely trouble Israel by violent and tyranicall intrusion into the Vineyards and lands of Naboth, but chiefely, by causing the people to forsake the Lord and his worship, and to follow Baal, or the Calues, as did Ieroboam, of whom it is therefore said, that he did euill aboue all that were before him; and why? For he did not onely sinne himselfe, but he did sin, and hee caused Israell to sinne, 1. Kings 14, verse 9. and 16.
            You see now what an heauy iudgement and curse an vnwise King is vnto the Land and people: but that Kingdome is happy, that people, and those Subiects are happy, ouer whom Salomon a wise and prudent King is placed by the Lord.
            I may truely heere say vnto you, your selues also being witnesse, and say it to the immortell praise of Gods name, to the honour of our Soueraigne, and to the ioy and comfort of all his people, that in this happinesse, this renowned Kingdome, among all, and aboue all Nations of the

earth is blessed this day. Happie O King are thy people, and 
                     •…
                  appie are thy Subiects or Seruants. It is not my meaning, nor is it fit, to make a panegericall Oration in this place at large, therein to recount and amplifie also those manifold blessings, which by the meanes of our SALOMON, we doe now enioy. Yet the more to stirre vs vp to magnifie and blesse Gods glorious name, and if it be possible, more also, to loue and honour that Sacred Maiesty whom God hath chosen to be his royall Instrument, whereby so many and great blessings are deriued vnto vs; I may not omit to mention some few which are most eminent, commending the rest to your priuate & Religious consideration.
            The first is our long tranquility and happie peace, with all the blessings and blessed fruites of peace. A blessing which God began to bestow on this land, at the ioyful entrance of our late Soueraigne QVEENE ELIZABETH, whose Sacred spirite doth now rest and raigne with the Lord, but her memory shall bee blessed and eternized in the world for euer; when all those venomous 
                  Pars in his answere to the Apol. and Viperous tongues (set on fire by hell) which now in vaine bark against her, and seeke to staine her spotlesse honour, shall rot, and be euen as the dung vpon the earth. Hauing enioyed long and happy peace, vnder her long and happy raigne, it was expected by the Agents and vassals of Antichrist, that the day which ended her life, should haue ended all our comforts, and beene to vs a dismall day, a day of murthers and massacres, a day of warres, of tumult, and of vtter desolation; one of their owne false Prophets West, de trip. homin.

                sat (as the Prophet Mich. 4. 4. saieth) Euery man vnder his owne Vine, and vnder his owne figtree without danger. Such, so long, and so happy peace, neuer did our Fathers nor Ancestors see before vs in this Land; nor haue any of all the Nations and neighbourkingdomes enioyed the like, who in the meane time haue beene wearied and wasted, either with forraigne or with intestine warre. Yea, and this very day which they had cruelly designed to weeping, mourning and lamentation, God by the happy meanes of our SALOMON, hath turned it (as we all now see) to a day of mirth and melodie; a day offeasting, singing, and reioycing; a day of praise and thankesgiuing to his blessed name, which be therefore magnified and praised, and blessed for euermore.
            A second blessing, which vnder our SALOMON this whole Empire enioyeth, is the sincere profession of Gods holy truth, the blessed continuance, yea the establishment also ther

            The extinguishing of this most glorious light, hath bin often wished, by most malicious and diuellish deuises attempted, and at the chaunge of our late Soueraigne, was vndoubtedly expected. But the wisedome of our SALOMON, knowing that Piety and Religion is the surest prop to a kingdome, (like Constantine

            What a wofull and miserable thing is it then, to bee a Papist, a member of the Church of Rome, or (which is all one) of Babylon? Especially, seeing God himselfe hath foretolde, Apocalipse 18, 4. that they who pertake of her sinnes, shall receiue also of her plagues. And againe, Apocalipse 14, 9, 10. If any receiue the marke of the Beast, (that is subiection vnto him) the same, vnlesse hee repent Apoc. 18, 14 and goe out of Babylon, shall drinke of the Wine of the wrath of God, and bee tormented in fire and Brimstone, before the holy Angelles, and before the Lambe.
            Thinke now with your selues, what a blessing and happinesse wee do all inioy, who vnder the most Religious

raigne of our Soueraigne, are freed and secured from that Iron, and more then Babylonish Captiuity: who in aboundance of peace and tranquility, liue to serue God in Bethel, and at IERVSALEM, in the house of God and Citty of peace, not in BETH-AVEN, not in BABYLON, in the house of vanity, of confusion and vtter desolation.

O daughter of Babylon, wasted with misery, happy shal he be that rewardeth thee, as thou hast serued vs, Blessed shall hee bee which taketh thy children, & dasheth them against the stones.
            To this blessing of Piety and Religion, let me adioyne another of neerest affinity, and which is also a speciall

meanes to continue the former happines vnto vs; to wit, the peaceable and happy setling of the Ecclesiasticall gouernment and affaires of our Church.

            But alas, it is too apparent to the world, & the church which hath felt the smart thereof, hath grieued and groned to see her owne children, whom she hath nourished, and tenderly brought vp, to rebell against her, and with Corah, Dathan and Abyram, to go apart, and make a faction against Moses and Aaron, and with disdainefull insolency to say Num. 16, 3. vnto them, Moses and Aaron, ye take too much vpon you, seeing all the congregation is holy, wherefore lift ye vp your selues aboue the congregation of the Lord.
            Nay though the Church out of the tendernesse of a mothers compassion, would willingly couer and conceale all these wronges, yet are they too well knowne in Gath, and published in the streets of Askalon; and the vncircumcised Philistims by these mens occasion, haue and do daily blaspheme the name of God, and his glorious truth and Gospell, which we do professe: who reioycing in our discordes, and saying among themselues; There, there, so would we haue it, do euen laugh and triumph, to see how those who should haue turned their edge against Amalecke and Babylon, the enemies of the Lord, haue bin most sharpely whetted, and seditiously backed also, to wound their owne mother; and those, who in the church are like Eliah,

            It is not my purpose at this time to intreat, eyther of the dignity, or of the Diuine and Sacred authoritie of those most reuerend Fathers of the Church, which in another very learned and Academicall assembly, I haue some yeares Praelect. I. in epist. ad Tit. Oxon. I. Iul. 1605. since at large demonstrated, to haue an assured and vndeniable warrant, not onely from all antiquity and the renowned practise of the whole Primitiue Church, but euen from the Apostles themselues, and from the diuine institution and ordinance of the Lord.
            Nor is it my purpose at this time, to make euident vnto you, how that Imperious, nay rather Imperiall, presbiteriall

Consistory, which those new builders had fancied; besides that, it wants all ground of Scripture and of Antiquity, is in truth, and in experience would prooue, a very Seminary of sedition, and a Sanctuary to euery turbulent and seditious Gracchus, both in Church and kingdome. Nor was it possible, that a fancy so repugnant to Scriptures, Fathers, and all Antiquity, so contrary to the peace and Tranquility both of Church and kingdome, could euer haue found like entertainment, if the maintainers and abetters thereof had not bin guided, nay blinded with two most dangerous affections both for Church and Common-wealth, affectation of Singularitie, and of Popularity.
            That which I would onely mention at this time, is the great blessing, which by the happy meanes of our Salomon we now enioy; who seeing, and grieuing to see a rent in Gods Church, himselfe like Psal. 106, 30 
               Phinees, stood in the gap, and with more then Princely Clemency and Moderation, made vp the breach, appeased those affaires, and remoued that shame and reproach from Israel, which the vnquietnesse of contentious spirits, had brought vppon it. Who being wise as the Angell of the Lorde, according to the aboundance of that admirable and Diuine wisedome, wherewith God hath extraordinarily filled his Royall heart, hath firmely setled and established the Arke of the Lord vpon those holy Mountaines of Sion, on which, euen from the most pure and primitiue dayes of the Church, and from the Apostles themselues it had euer rested. Which if their fancy might haue preuailed, had long since not onely beene remooued from Sion, but placed also as did the Philistims place it. 1. Sam. 6, 11. most basely and totteringly, and disgracefully euen set vpon a Cart.
            In the happy establishing whereof, though some fewe as the Eckronites 
               1. Sath. 5▪ 10, 12. haue bin iustly smitten of the Lord, because they neither had right, nor bare sincere loue to the Arke of God, whose cure also hath beene sought, & that with most tender and fatherly care and compassion: but

such is the zeale of opposition, and predominancy of Popularity and contentious humors, that by no demonstrations of reason will they be perswaded, no, not when they are indeed perswaded; by no authority will they be mo

               ed, no, not by that Sacred and Soueraigne, which God himselfe hath appointed in many of those affaires, to bee the very Canon and rule of right: though some fewe of these, I say, may repine heereat, yet shall it euer be the honour, yea, the felicity and safety also of our Soueraigne, to haue those holy Aarons to support his Princely hands: and this shall euer be reckoned as a speciall, and as it is in truth, euen a rare blessing of God vpon this Church and Kingdome, by all those, whosoeuer not in shew, but in sincerity and truth, wish to see peace in Sion, and prosperity in Ierusalem.
            
            I must in silence passe by many other and great blessings, which by the meanes of our SALOMON, are heaped vpon vs. But let my tongue cleaue to the roofe of my mouth, if I forget that one most memorable happinesse, which wee all receiued by him on that fift of Nouember. That one day shall be for euer a most glorious. Tro▪ haeum, and euerlasting Monument, both of his most blessed and vnspeakable Wisedom, and of the infinit blessings which by him we haue all receiued. By it, wee enioy not onely our Goods, our Lands, our Liuings, our Liberty, our Religion; but euen this, that we liue and breath this day, we owe it to him, and to his wisedome.
            It was not the Loue nor Loyalty of his, though most louing and Loyall Subiects, which preuented that sudden and secret blow, that should at once haue dispatched and blowne vp all. It was not the Prudence and vigilancie of those thrice-Noble woorthies of King Dauid; the Golden pillers of Israel, though a most wise, and a most Honourable Senate. All may, and all willingly doe disclaime the praise of that day. The whole honour of that most wonderfull, and withall, most happy deliuerance, must bee giuen first to thee, O most glorious, and most

gracious God, and next after thee to thine annointed alone. Thou didst fill his hart, as thou didst sometime the hart of thy holy Prophet Daniel, with wisedome frō aboue to Dan. I. 21. 22 
               Discouer the deepe and secret thinges, and to know what is in darknesse. And he being full of thy Spirit, to the endlesse comfort of this Empire, and of all his loiall subiectes, discouered indeede that darke and secret speech, that darke and secret Vaut, that darke, secret, and hellish treason, & so kept off that imminent blow, which would haue proued fatall to him, to vs, and to all his kingdomes.
            The happinesse of that day, & of thy wisedome (O gracious King) our Histories and Chronicles shal commend, our Lawes and Statutes shall record to all eternity. Euery Citty, Towne, and Village, euery Church in this Land, euery degree of thy people, from the tallest Caeder, to the very Shrubbe, shall sing and sound foorth thy Noble praise. And as the Israelites did Zach. 12, 12, 13. in honor of Iosiah, euery Tribe and family shall praise thee apart, and their Wiues apart: The royall and princely Tribe of Iuda shall prayse thee apart, and the holy Tribe of Leuie shall praise thee apart: The Nobility shall praise thee apart: the Gentry & Commons shall praise thee apart: The Students of a
                  •…
               professions shal praise thee apart: the Men of Warre, and the Men of Peace shall praise thee apart: yea, euery House, & euery Family throughout all Israell shall praise thee apart.
            We in this age will speake of thy praise to our Children, & our Children, to their Childrens Children, vnto all generations. And if it were possible that we or our posteritie could bee silent herein, yet the Magnificent and princely buildings and Monumentes, in these two famous and renowned Citties, the very wood and wals of these houses, & stones in these streets, euen with their dumb eloquence, would sing aloud, and sound foorth thy Noble praise: all which in their kinds are pertakers of that happines, which vnder thee, and by thee, we then all receiued.
            Iudge now with your selues, if besides many and great blessinges which I haue purposely omitted, for these so

great and indeed inualuable blessings which by the happy meanes of our SALOMON we doe enioy, we may not all most iustly say to him, as did the Queene of Sheba to King Salomon: [Happy O King are thy people, and happy are thy Seruants.]
            Shall I further here adde, whereof this Queene is silent in that King of Israel, that the wisedom of our SALOMON is an happinesse, not onely to his owne people and Subiectes, but euen to strangers also? The gracious beames there of like those of the Sunne, spreading themselues to far and forraine Countries; yea, to the vtmost Coastes of this and the other world.
            To omit many other and euident proofes hereof, euen that which beeing the chiefe, if time would suffer ought not to bee omitted, that with such constancy and zeale, himselfe holds forth a glorious Lampe of Piety, and true Religion vnto all Christian Kings and kingdomes, performing heerein that which Gods spirite hath noted Eccle. 12. 9. as the greatest part of wisdome, the more wise the King was, the more he taught them knowledge, & caused them to heare: But omitting these, let the honourable expedition now happily intended for Virginea be a witnesse: enterprised, I say not auspicijs, but by the most wise & religious direction and protection of our chiefest Pilot, seconded by so many honorable and worthy personages in this State and kingdome, that it may iustly giue encouragement with alacrity and cheerefulnesse for some to vndertake, for others to further so noble & so religious an attempt. I may not stay in this straightnes of time, to mention, much lesse set forth vnto you, the great and manifold benefits which may redound to this our so populous a Nation, by planting an English Colony in a Territory as large and spacious almost as is England, and in a soyle so rich, fertill, and fruitefull, as that besides the sufficiencyes it naturally yealds for it selfe, may with best conuenience, supply some of the greatest wantes and necessities of these Kingdomes. Of these and such like particulars I will

not now intreat, though I could commend them by more then ordinary and vulgar report vnto you.
            But that happinesse which I mentioned, is an happie and glorious worke indeede, of planting among those poore and sauage, and to be pittied Virginians, not onely humanitie, instead of brutish inciuility, but Religion also, Piety, the true knowledge and sincere worship of GOD, where his name is not heard off: and reducing those to Faith and saluation by Christ▪ who as yet in the blindnesse of their Infidelity and superstition, doe offer Sacrifice, yea, euen themselues vnto the Diuell.
            This being the Religious and honourable intendment of this enterprise, what glory shall heereby redound vnto God? What Honour to our Soueraigne? What comfort to those his Subiects, who shall be the meanes or furtherers of so happy a worke, not only to see a new BRITTAINE in another world, but to heare also those, as yet Heathen, Barbarous, and Brutish people, together with our English, to learne the speech and language of Canaan: and next after their Hymnes and Alleluia
                     •…
                  es vnto God, to sound forth the honour and happinesse of our Soueraigne; not onely saying with this Queene of Sheba, Happy are thy people, and thy Subiects, but happy are wee and others, that were strangers to you; yea strangers and aliants to God, happy are we by thee, and by thy wisedome.
            And this be spoken of the second generall point, which concernes the people and their happinesse, by hauing Salomon a wise and prudent King to rule ouer them.
            The third generall point concernes almighty God, and containes a thankesgiuing to him, for setting Salomon a wise King to rule ouer his people. Blessed bee the Lorde thy God which set thee on his Throne.
            
            The acknowledgement in this Queene, of the true God of Israel, of his Diuine prouidence, and omnipotent power in placing Salomon in his owne Throne; of his goodnesse and loue to Israel, whom hee would establish for euer; of his righteousnesse, in that hee would

haue his people gouerned by Iustice and Iudgement; specially this her Religious thankesgiuing vnto God, for this blessing bestowed on his people; all these are so many euident demonstrations of her true knowledge of God, of her loue to God, and Gods Children, of her sincere Piety, and Religious seruing of God; & that though by Nature she was a Gentile, and aliant from God, yet was she by his speciall grace one of those Primitiae gentium, which were ingrafted into the true Oliue, and made pertakers of the fatnesse thereof, and of those heauenly blessings stored vp in Iesus Christ.
            But I purposely omit all these particulers. The onely point which I would now commend vnto you is, what a motiue and prouocation this ought to bee for vs all, to laud and magnifie the Lord, for placing so wise and Religious a King ouer vs and all these kingdomes.
            King Salomon was but a stranger to this Queene, who yet as you see is so thankfull to God: He so farre from being a stranger to vs, that we may say as did the Tribes of Israel to King Dauid. 2. Sam. 5, 1. We are thy bones, and thy flesh.
            She being but a soiourner for a very short time in that kingdome, could not long pertake the benefit of his instructions, nor of peace and protection by his Iustice and Iudgement: But we from our SALOMON, receiue continuall influence of his Diuine both Sacred and Politicall Wisedome, continuall protection vnder his sacred shield, continuall tranqu
                  •…
               lity vnder his most iust, equall, and wholsome Lawes, both Ecclesiasticall and Ciuill: How much more then should our mouths be filled with praises and blessings vnto the Lord our God? And how Religiously should we say as she did; Blessed be the Lord thy GOD, which loued thee, to set thee on his Throne.
            
            I doubt not, but for these blessings of the Lord, often times in your priuate houses and Chambers, ye sing Hymnes and Psalmes with a grace in your heartes vnto the Lord. But because for these publicke and extraordinary

blessinges, GOD lookes for publicke and extraordinary praises at our hands; because we are now assembled in this place, as at the Temple of Ierusalem, of purpose to offer the sweet Sacrifice and Incense of our lippes vnto God, and this day both before men and Angels, to testifie our thanksgiuing vnto God, our loue and▪ loyaltie to our Soueraigne. Let euery one of you prouoke & stirre vp another, and suffer me as one of the Trumpeters of the Lord to excite vs all, and stirre vp your prepared hearts, and Religious affections, for all and euery of these blessings, to laud and magnifie the glorious name of God, and if it be possible, by some extraordinary straine of our vnited thankes, to pierce the very skies, and giue an eccho to those Celestiall Quires, singing Halleluiah, Halleluiah, honour, and praise, and glory, be vnto God, & to the Lamb for euermore.
            First, for that aboundance of our continued and happy peace, let vs say with the Prophet, Psa. 147, 12, 13. Praise the Lord, O Ierusalem, praise thy God, O Sion, for he hath made fast the barres of thy gates, and blessed thy children within thee: He maketh peace in thy borders, and filleth thee with the flower of Wheat.
            For establishing togither with this peace, his holy Temple and Sanctuary among vs, and in it the true and sincere worship of his holy name, O that wee could expresse the like ioy, as did the Israelites for their Temple which Salomon built and established among them! All the congregation assembled therein, the Leuites and singers of all sortes, of Asaph, Heman, and Ieduthun, being clad in fine Linnen, stood with Cimbals, with Vyols, & with Harpes, at the East end of the Altar, and with them an hundered and twenty Priests blowing with Trumpets, & they were all but as one man, and made but one sound to be heard in praising the Lorde. 2. Chron. 5, 12, 13. But because the pompe and beauty of the second Temple, is euen as nothing to the first, let vs yet with the best Trumpets of our hearts and tongues, and with all our most solemne Instruments

of musick, sing that Psalme of Thanksgiuing, which they then did vnto God; Praise the Lord, for he is good, and his mercy indureth for euer. Praise the Lord.
            Like ioy and thankesgiuing let vs all shew for the Arke of the Lord, which by the meanes of our SALOMON, according to Gods owne ordinance is established on those holy Mountaines of Sion, of which the Lord hath saide, Heere will I dwell, for I haue a delight therein.
            Yea, let vs for these blessings, not onely sing and reioyce, but with the Kingly Prophet, 2 Sam. 6. 14. 15. euen shoute, and daunce with all our might before the Lorde. For which, howsoeuer some Michols of Babylon, or of the house of Saule, shall scoffe and scorne, and tauntingly say vnto vs. O how glorious are you for the Temple, and for the Arke this day! yet this is our comfort, and shall for euer bee our honour, that in vprightnesse of heart, we can truly say with that man of God: It is before the Lord, who hath chosen vs, and not your Fathers house, and who hath commaunded vs to rule ouer the people of God: and therefore will wee sing, and play, and daunce; yea, and be more vile also then thus before the Lorde. And euen of those maide-seruants of Israel, of whom you spake, that is, of the holy Church of God, shall we be had in honor. But for those scoffing Michols of the reiected house of Saule, and those blaspheming Rabsekaes of Assyria, they shall be as chaffe scattered before the Winde, and as dung swept away from the presence of the Lord, and from the face of the earth.
            But what can we render vnto God, or say vnto him for that most rare and woonderfull deliuerance? Let vs say with the Israelites, after the like deliuery from the Iawes of Pharaoh and the red sea. Exod. 15, ver. 1, 2, 11. We will sing vnto the lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously. Who is like vnto thee O Lord; glorious in holines, fearefull in praises & doing wonders: the lord is my strength & praise, & is become my saluation: he is my God, and I will praise him▪ he is my fathers God, and I will exalt him. Or let vs

sing that Psalme Psal. 124. of the whole Church. If the Lord himselfe had not beene on our side, may Israel now say. They had swallowed vs vp quicke when they were so wrathfully displeased at vs. The Waters; nay, the raging Fires had deuoured vs, the flames had gone ouer our soule. Praised bee the Lord, which hath not giuen vs ouer for a prey vnto their teeth.
            Lastly, for all these, and for all other the blessinges of the Lord; specially, for his Sacred Maiesty, vnder whom, and by whom wee liue, and liue to enioy them all; let vs with one heart and minde sing that last Psalme of the Prophet: O praise God in his holinesse, praise him in the firmament of his power; praise him in his Noble actes, praise him according to his excellent greatnesse: Praise him in the sounde of the Trumpet, praise him vppon the Lute and Harpe, praise him in the Cimbals and Daunces, praise him vpon the strings and Pipe: praise him vpon the well-tuned Cimbals, praise him vpon the loud Cimbals. Let euery thing that hath breath, praise the Lord.
            And this be spoken of the thankesgiuing to God, for placing Salomon a wise King ouer his people.
            In this Thankesgiuing, we before obserued two particular Branches. The former was, from whom King Salomon had and held his kingdome. Of which it is heere shewed, that he had it neither from the Priest, nor from the people, but immediately from God; and therefore, it is expressely heere said, [God made thee King ouer Israel and He set thee on the Throne] not the Priest, not the people, but God made him King, and God set him on the Throne. For further euidence whereof, it is heere added that Salomon was set in the Throne, neither of the Priest, nor of the people, but he was set in Gods owne Throne, as King, & set there in Gods steed, as one immediately represeuting Gods owne person among them, and beeing his immediate Vice-gerent, or Lieutenant ouer all Israel.
            
            To this purpose, the Scriptures, not onely in generall call Kings the Ministers or Lieutenants of God, Rom. 13,

4. and saith, that God sets vp Kinges and giues kingdoms, Daniel 2. 21. 37. but particularly also noteth this immediate designment of God in many of them: as of Dauid, The Lord chose him to be King, and delighted in him to make him King ouer all Israell. 1. Chron. 28, 4. Of Saul, The Lord hath annointed thee to be Gouernor ouer his inheritance, 1. Sam. 10. 1. Of Hasael and Iehu, God saide vnto the Prophet, annoint Hasael King ouer Aram, and Iehu shalt thou annoint King ouer Israel, 1. King. 19, 15. and to omit others of Salomon, whom our Text mentioneth: God chose Salomon to sit vpon the Throne, and he said of Salomon; I will stablish his Kingdome for euer. 1. Chron. 28, 5, 7.

Epist. 166. and yet had Kinges depended on any superior power, their commaunds should haue beene both Christs, and his also to whom they had beene subiect.
            Sacred to their owne Pope Gregory the first; great I confesse for learning, but in acknowledgement of this truth, which is now at Rome so ridiculous, farre greater. In his 2. Book of Epist. ca. 100. He thus writes of Mauritius the Emperor. Potestas super omnes homines, dominorum meorum pietati
               
               caelitus data est. First, he cals the Emperor his Lord, then he faith, power and authority is giuen vnto him, but from whom? Caelitus, euen from GOD, and from Heauen. I, but perhaps with a subordination or mediation of some other. No (saith Pope Gregory) it is giuen him aboue, and ouer all other persons whatsoeuer; and therefore without any dependance of men, who are all inferiors to him, & so immediately depending and deriued from God, who alone (as this Pope truely saith) is aboue the Emperour.
            Omitting the succession of other ages, let me adioyn to these, two other most memorable examples, and of far later times: the one in the Roman, which is electiue; the other, in our English, which is an hereditary Kingdome.

            These are the very words of that imperiall Law, as you may see them set downe, and much more to this purpose. In Hieron▪ Balbus, one of their owne Popish Bishops, in his Booke De Coronatione, dedicated vnto Charles the fift, the Emperor. Pag. 39. and 40. of that Booke.
            The other Testimony is an Authenticall record also of no lesse moment, and somewhat of a later time. A statute made in the 16. yeare of King Richard 2. Cap. 5. of purpose to keepe sacred and inuiolable the Soueraignety and Regality of this Kingdome. It was therein declared, that the Crowne of England hath beene so free at all times (not then onely, but which is specially to bee remembered at all times) that it hath beene in subiection to no Realme, but Immediately subiect to GOD, and to none other, in all thinges touching the Regalty of the same. These are the words in that statute, besides diuers other tending hereunto, In defence of which statute they in the Parliament then assembled, promised to liue and die, as it is there noted.
            By al which it is euident, that this doctrine which now at Rome is counted most ridiculous, is in it self most sacred, as being grounded on the scriptures of God; and as most sacred hath bin embraced by all the Christians in the primitiue Church; taught and maintained with a generall consent by the ancient and godly fathers in their seuerall ages and successions: constantly defended by whole kingdoms and Empires, and that vnder paine of high Treason to the gainesayers thereof, euen in those later times also, when superstition had dimd, I cōfesse, but not quite extinguished and put out the truth, and (which is far worse) the loue of the truth, as it may iustly be feared, it hath done at this day in Rome, and in those of their sect, who to error and heresie haue added not onely obstinacy, but blasphemy, like new Lucians scoffing the sacred truth of God, accounting it a most a ridiculous matter.
            
               May I with your patience proceed a litle further in this argument, to consider (which is in truth worthy your consideration; seeing these men will not allow Kinges and Emperours to hold immediately from God, which being the most Honourable, is most fit to bee a Regall Tenure) to whom else they would haue them bee beholden, and to doe homage and fealty for their Crownes and Kingdomes.
            And to whom else thinke you but to the vtter enemie of God, to that man of sinne, and sonne of perdition, who exalts himselfe indeed, as the Apostle 2. Thes. 2. 4. saith, and whom they also haue exalted aboue all: Exalting him first from a Christian Byshop, to an Antichristian Pope, and then from a Pope or Pastor, to a Temporall King & supreame Monarch of all, whose Soueraignty must be ouer al Kings and people, and his Dominion ouer all Lands, goods, and possessions in the whole world. Euen of this man of sinne, must all Kings hold their Crownes and Kingdomes, and that in the most base & seruile tenure that can be deuised, holding thē as Tenants at will, Ex Pontificis mero fauore & gratia, by the meere fauor & good wil of the Pope; as the vaine Triumpher Breuis narrat. victor.

Popes, who Sacrar. Cerē. san. Rom. eccles lib. 1. sect. 7, pa: 85▪
                yearely on the night of Christs Natiuity, bestowes an hallowed sword of some great Prince, whom it pleaseth him, the Mystery of which gift, as the Pope himselfe explaines it, is to betoken thereby, Potestatem summam temporalem à Christi pontifici collatum, that the supreame Temporall power is giuen to the Pope by Christ, according to those scriptures (which most blasphemously the Popes apply to themselues) all power is giuen to mee in heauen, and in earth. And againe, hee shall rule from the one Sea to the other, and from the floude vnto the worlds end.
            Thus teach Carerius, Bozius; together with their Popes and Popish Confederates, whose very wordes, in so important a cause, I haue now more at large, and expressely alledged.
            You do now euidently perceiue, that these men who thought it a most ridiculous matter, for Kinges to holde their Crownes immediately from God, do teach and define it to bee a matter of Religion, of Piety, of Conscience; yea, of saluation, to holde the same immediately from the Beast, that is in truth, from the verie Deuill; for of the Beast, (the Apostle saith) Apocalipse 13, 1. that the Draggon, which is the Diuell, gaue the Beast his power, and his Throne, and his great Authoritie.
            These are the fruites of Popish Religion, and this the verie HELENA for which they so earnestly fight and contend. Of which Positions, (though I might iustly say as did Saint HIEROME Hier. epist. ad Ctesiph. aduer. Pelag. to. 2, pa. 260. in another cause, Sententias vestras prodidisse, superesse▪ est, patet prima fionte blasphemia. To haue recited your assertions, is enough to refute them, they are stamped with Blasphemy in the verie fore-heade; yet as you haue willingly heard the iust defence of Regall Soueraignty, so suffer me to speake somewhat also at this time against him, who shewes himselfe in his colours, to be Hostem humani generis, the enemie not of one or two Kingdomes, or some people

and sort of men, but the enemy of all mankind: who most violently intrudes himselfe into the rightes and regalities of all Kings, Christian and Heathen, and like a wild Boare inuades the lands, goods, and possessions of all men in the world; yea, most sacrilegiously challengeth vnto himselfe that which is the peculiar prerogatiue (and as I may say▪) one of the Royalties of God, Domini est terra, The Earth is the Lords, and all that is therein. Psal. 24, 1.
            I shall not neede to prooue that this priestly Monarchy was not known in the time of the old Testament: of which not onely Aquina: 
               In veteri testamento regnum praeeminebat sacerdotio, Ideoibi regnū, hic sacerdotiū in substan tiuo ponuntur, eo quod ibi ex reg no, hic ex sacerdotio quasi subsista: religio Aqui. com. in 1. Pet 1. and Stapleton,

Carer. l. 2. ca. 18▪ Respondeo. that the King had then power ouer the Priestes, and might for their offences, not onely haue depriued them of their spirituall offices, but haue kild thē also: that in the time of the old Testament Hinc in lege veteri Regnum erat substantiuum▪ et lacerdotium adiectiuum. Car. l. 2. ca. 1. §. Hinc. the Kingdom was the Substantiue or superior, & the Priesthood was thē but an Adiectiue, as depending in good congruity vpon the other, though the Pope since hath altered that most congraeous Grāmer rule, that seeing in the Old Testament the promises were onely temporall, but in the New are eternall, Mirum 
               Car. l. 2. ca. 18. §. Secundo. 
               minime videri debet, si in veteri testamento sū ma potestas fuerit Temporalis: It must not seeme strange as he saith, that the temporall power in the time of the Olde Testament, was the Supreame. So then, though they pretend Ecclefiasticam potestatem, naturali iure esse omnino super saecularem, &c. Boz. lib. 1. pa. 7. et cap. 2. pag. 38. for this Soueraignty the Law of Nature, yet by this expresse confession, and cleare wordes of Aquinas and Carerius, it is euident, that this priestly Monarchy was not heard of, for the first Ad passionem Christi vigebat. Lex. passio incidit in an. mundi 3996. Funct. foure thousand yeares almost of the world.
            In the New Testament what in duty ought first to bee performed by the Apostles and their successours, let the holy Apostle, or the Spirite of God by his mouth speake▪
               
and determine. Let euery soule (saith Rom. 13. 1. he) be subiect to the higher powers: which himself in that place expounds to bee those seculare Kinges and Princes, who beare Ib. V. 4. 6, 7.

Church of Rome, euen at that time also when Saint Peter by their Doctrine Bell l▪ 2. de pont. Ro. ca▪ 2 & 5. was Bishop of Rome: and therefore the spirit of GOD commaunding euery Soule (particularly in that Church) to bee subiect to the secular powers and Princes, without all doubt inioynes obedience and subiection, euen to S. Peter himselfe, and to all his successours; yea, much rather vnto them, who were to be Ensamples 1 Tim. 4. 12 to the rest, both in word and in conuersation.
            A truth so cleare, that Claudius Espenseus, 
               Comment. in ca. 3. Epist. ad Tit. dig

                   10 one of their owne and a learned Bishoppe, not onely confesseth thus much, but confirmes it further out of Theodoret, Theophilact, Oecumenius, and others; specially out of Saint Chrysostome, who expresly Chrys. in cap 13. ad▪ Rom. mentions the Apostles themselues, to be included in that precept. Etiam si Apostolus sis, though you bee an Apostle, though an Euangelist, though a Prophet, (and which I thinke will reach to the Pope) Etiam si quiuis alius fueris, or what else soeuer you bee, euery Soule must be subiect to those higher and secular powers.
            Or if any notwithstanding this euidence of truth and such a Cloud of witnesses, wil yet exempt either the Pope, or any other from this duty, it may most iustly be replyed vnto him, with the wordes of Saint Barnard, in his 42. Epist. Si omnis anima, et vestra: If euery Soule bee subiect, then must yours, Who hath exempted you from this vniuersality? Si quis tentat excipere, conatur decipere. If any goe about to exempt you, he goeth about to deceiue & tempt you. And again, do ye despice seculare powers? Seculiarior nemo Pilato, none was more secular then Pilot, before whō Christ himselfe stood to be Iudged, and of whom he confessed: Potestatem super sefuisse caelitus ordinatam: That Pilate had power ouer him, and that giuen from God.
            What in duty then ought to bee done for the whole

time of the New Testament, by this example of Christ, and precept of Gods Spirit, is most euident. And as subiection is commaunded by God, so was it practised and performed by the Apostles, by the primitiue Bishops; yea, euen by the Popes themselues, for many hundreths of years together.
            For the first three hundreth yeares after Christ, while Kings and Emperours were Paganes and Persequutors of the Church, it is confessed both by Bellarmine 
               Quo tempore principes erant Ethnici, nō erat Pontifex iudex illorum, sed è contrario illis subiectus erat in omnibus ciuilibus causis non minus quam caeteri homines. Bel lib. 2. de pontif. Rom. cap 29. §. Respōdeo, primo. and Carerius, 
               Carer. eadem verba habet quae Bell. lib 2 ca 23, §. Respondetur. that for all that time, the Apostles and Bishops of Rome were subiect tō Emperours, as all other Christians were: and this subiection was Bel. ibid. §. Quod Carer▪ loc. citat. both De iure, & de facto, both indeede performed, and in right to be performed.
            What? And shall wee thinke (which they without all shame would perswade) that their conuersion to the faith, was the ouerthrow and aeuersion of their temporall dominions? And that the gaine of Christ, was the losse of all their Crownes and Kingdomes? Nor onely so, but that of Soueraignes they became subiects euen, to those, who before while they were Paganes, were de iure & facto, subiect vnto them?
            I will not say what an effectuall dissuasion this might haue beene vnto them, and others also, neuer to haue embraced the Fayth: What a motiue it may yet bee to turne Heathen and Paganes againe. I will not enforce that true Maxime, approoued both (Bell. et Car. loc. citat by Bellarmine and Carerius: Lex Christiana neminem suo iure et dominio priuat: Christianity

With what lowlinesse and humility did Pope Leo the first, foure Leo caepit. an. 443, prosp. hundreth and odde yeares after Christ, sue Leo cpist. 9. et 24. vnto the Emperor Theodosius the younger, that he would call a generall counsell in Italy, and yet preuailed not.

It Greg. l. 4. Epist. ca. 78. well beseemes a religious Prince Vt ista sacerdotibus praeciperet, to commaund Bishops in such matters: And that particular was an Ecclesiasticall cause also, betwixt Pope Gregory himselfe, and Iohn Bishop of Constantinople, in which the Pope confesseth, that it well beseemed a Christian Prince to command, not onely other Bishops, but euen the Bishop of Rome himselfe. And as it was fit for the Emperour to commaund, so the same Pope iudged it his duty, and fit for him to obey. Vobis

            Did I say, it is not erected? I say more, This Tower of Babylon neither can, nor euer shalbe erected. Not so much because by gods▪ iust iudgment, the tongues and trowels of those builders are most strangely confounded, but because they build it in pride to Gen. 11, 4. get thēselus a name, & that they may say as did old Babylon in the Prophet, I say 47, 7, 8.

            True Loyalty (which I doubt not but you do performe, and to the constant and continuall performance whereof, I earnestly exhort you all this day) is to looke at our Soueraigne, as at one placed immediately by God, placed in Gods owne Throne, placed in the steede of God himselfe among vs: And then to loue, honour, and obey him, not for other respects, but for that Loue, Religious dutie and conscience, which wee owe vnto God, who placed him in his own throne, and in his own stead to gouerne vs.
            To honour and obey him for fear, is seruility and basenesse; to obey for gaine or profit, is selfe-loue; to obey with that implyed condition, is Implicite, Rebellion, and Antichristian; to loue and honour him (as wee all ought) for his owne Piety, Vertue, and goodnesse, is Christian Charity; but to loue and obey him for Gods owne cause, who set him in his owne Throne, to rule in his own steed, is true and Christian Loyalty, true and most loyall Subiection. And this be spoken of the first particular braunch proposed; Namely, from whom the King had or held his kingdome, euen immediately from God, who made him King, who set him in his Throne, and in his steed ouer the people.
            
               The other particular; Namely, what moued or induced God to place Salomon ouer his people, which was no desert of theirs, either King or people, but his owne fauour and free loue vnto them, I purposely omit, and in that short remainder of the allowed time, intend to speake a little of the last point, and then commend you all to the grace of God.

            The like customes of giuing presents, hath bin vsuall from subiects also, thereby to testifie, not only their loue, as did strangers, but their loyalty also to their Soueraignes. Suetonius
               In vir. Aug. cap. 57. 58. reportes, that the Romans by their Strenae or annuall presents, testified their loue to Augustus, whom they honoured as Patrem patriae. Of King Iehosaphat it is said. 2. Chron. 17, 5. that in token of their loue and loyall affections, All Iudah brought presents to Iehosophat. On the contrary, it is said of those wicked men, sonnes of Belial, and vndutifull Subiects of King Saule, the wicked men despised him, and brought him no presents 1. Sam. 10. 27.
            It is not my purpose to speak of this particular vnto you, though I might truely compare the willingnes and readinesse of the subiectes of our SALOMON, to those of Constantius Clorus, father vnto Constantine the Great. Of whom Eusebius saith, Abiecta omni cūctatione, mature, auro, argento & alijs opum generibus aeraria eius complete laborant. Studio quodam & ardore inter se, quo alius alium in largiendo superaret, vehementer contēdunt. Euseb. in vit. Const. lib. 1. cap. 10. that they did striue, and vehemently contend among themselues to fill the Emperours Treasury, reioycing greatly, that now they had that long wished for opportunity, to witnesse their beneuolous harts and minds vnto the Emperour. Whereupon he truely and excellently saide, That the loue of the people is the richest and safest Treasury of the Prince.
            But for the generality, which is the outward testifying of loue and loyalty, In ▪ust needs say thus much, that it is the honour of

our Religion, and the honour of so religious a people, and no doubt, it is also the ioy and comfort of our Soueraigne, to haue

            The people to testifie their loue, vsed to celebrate some festiual dayes in honour of their Emperor. Sometimes Natalem ortus, the day of the Emperors birth, as the Romans in Suetonius
               Natalem eius sponte, biduo semper celebrarunt. Suet. in. vit. Aug. cap. 57. of their own

            I may truely say, that as wee haue far greater cause, so haue we and the whole people of this land expressed farre greater ioy, both for the most happy birth, the most happy Inauguration, and those two most strange and most happy deliuerances of our most gracious Soueraigne.

                of his blessings vpon them.

            And now for conclusion of all, let vs once againe and continually pray, in those few, but most feruent and affectionate wordes of Nehemiah: God saue the King for euer, and let all the people say, Amen.
