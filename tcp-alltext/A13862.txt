               As towchinge the diſtribution of my temporall goodes / my purpoſe is by the grace of god to beſtowe them / to be accepted as frutes of faith. So that I do not ſuppoſe that my merite ſhalbe by the good beſtowinge of them / but my merite is the faith of Ieſu Chriſte onlye wherbye ſuche woorkes be good. Matth. xxv. I was hongrye ād thou gaueſt me to eate / and it foloweth / that ye haue done to the leeſt of my bretherne ye haue done to me &c̄. And euer we ſhuld conſyder the true ſentence / a good worke maketh not a good mā / but a good man makethe a good woorke / for faith maketh the man Both good & right wyſe / for a rightwyſe man lyueth by faith. Rom. i. And whatſoeuer ſpringeth not owt of faith is ſynne. Rom. xiiij
               And all my temporall goodes that I haue not geuen and delyuered / or not geuen by wrytinge of my awne hande / berynge the date of this preſent wrytynge / I do leaue / and gyue to Margarete my wyfe and to Richard my ſonne / which I make myne executours: wytnes this myne awne hande / the .x. daye of October / in the .xxij. yere of the raygne of kynge Henry the .viij.

Heb. xj. in ſo moche that S. Auſtyn called thoſe workes that are done before faith / ſwiffte runnynge owt of the waye. Morouer that owr merite cannot properlye be aſſcrybed vnto owr workes doth the Euangeliſte teche vs ſaynge / when ye haue done all thinges that ar commaunded yow / ſaye we are vnprofitable ſeruauntis / we haue done but owr deutye. Luke .xvij. By the which ſayynge he doth in a maner feare vs frome puttyng any confydence in our owne workes: And ſo is owr glorious pryde / and hye mynde excluded. Then where is owr merite

This deathe of the lorde cannot proffite me / excepte I receyue it thorowe faith / and therfore he reckenyth right well that the faith in Chriſte is all his meryt / I meane the faith which worketh thorowe cherite / that is to ſaye fayth / formed with hope & cherite / & not that dead hiſtoricall faith which the deuyls haue and tremble.

rather a good man makethe the worke good / for ther is no man but he is eyther good or euyll / If he be euyll then can he not do good but euyll / for accordinge to Chriſtes teſtimonye / a rootten tree bearithe no good frute. Matth. vij. And agayne he ſaith / how cā you ſaye well ſeynge you youre ſelues are euyll. Mat. xij. But yf he be good / he ſhal alſo bringe forth good frute at his ceaſone / how be it that frute makethe not the man good / for except the man be firſte good he can not bringe forth good frute / but the tree is knowen by the frute / And therfore faith as a quyckenynge roote muſt euer go before / which of wicked maketh vs rightwyſe and good / whiche thinge oure workes coulde neuer bringe to paſſe / out of this foū
