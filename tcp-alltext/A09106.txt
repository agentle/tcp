CONCERNING Certaine imputations of wilfull falsities obiected to the said T. M. in a Treatise of P. R. intituled Of Mitigation, some part wherof he hath lately attempted to answere in a large Preamble to a more ample Reioynder promised by him.
            But 
                  •
               eere in the meane space the said imputations are iustified, and confirmed, & with much increase of new vntruthes on his part returned vpon him againe: So as finally the Reckoning being made, the Verdict of the Angell, interpreted by Daniel, is verified of him.
                  Daniel 5. vers. 27.
                  Appensus es in statera, & inuentus es minus habens.
                  You haue byn weighed in the ballance, & are found to want weight.
               
            
            There is also adioyned a peece of a Reckoning with Syr Edward Cooke, now L. Chief Iustice of the Cōmon Pleas, about a Nihil dicit, & some other points vttered by him in two late Preambles, to his sixt and seauenth Partes of Reports.

            THE STATE OF THE QVESTION handled in this Booke.
            MAISTER Thomas Morton vpon the yeare 1606. tooke vpon him to write a malicious Dis

                  erie against Catholicks, and their doctrine about Rebellion presently vpon the powder-treason: and the Pamphlet was soone after confuted and returned vpon himselfe by the Moderate Answerer: he replyed with a discourse intituled, A full Satisfaction: adding therunto another Treatise against Equiuocation. To this opposed himselfe P. R. Author of the Treatise tending to Mitigation: and handled in the same both the one and other subiect, charging him further with many foule faultes of witting falsehood; wherunto M. Morton hath exhibited now lastly a large new Preamble, with promise of another booke to follow in time, that is to say, he hath presented a great head without a body; and this with no small signes of extraordinary impatience.
            For pacifying wherof P. R. hath takē the paines to reuiew o
                  ••
               er againe the accompts, and findeth him farre more faultie then before. For that in lieu of clearing old debts, he contracteth new, and in excusing former falsities, he multiplieth many other. So as now,
            
               The chiefe question commeth to be,
               Whether M. Mort. (in the cause he defendeth) can write truely or no: & whether his falshood therin be volūtary or necessarie, or rather both: that is to say, voluntary in respect of himselfe, that might haue omitted them: and nec

                  ssarie in regard of his cause, that could not be defended without them
                     •
                   and consequently in different respects, both voluntary and necessary. In which point M. Morton holdeth the negatiue, I the affirmatiue. The Reader shall see the proofes of both sides.
            
         
         
            
            A BRIEF NOTE OF THE CHAPTERS VVHICH ARE set forth more largely in the end of this Booke, with their seuerall Paragraphes.
            THE first conteyneth the Answere to M. Morton his first Inquiry, about the VVit, Learning, Memorie &c. of his Aduersary P.R.
            
            2 The second answereth the secōd Inquiry, about some points touching the subiect of Rebellion and Equiuocation.
            3 The third hādleth a part of the third Inquiry about many falsities obiected by M. Morton against Cardinall Bellarmine.
            
            4 The fourth discusseth like imputations of falsities obiected by him against his Aduersary P. R.
            
            5 The fift examineth how substātially M. Morton endeauoureth to

               are himselfe from many wilfull vntruthes, obiected against him by P.R.
            
            6 The sixt layeth forth a great number of vntruthes, obiected to M. Morton, which he pretermitteth without answere or mention.
            7 The seauenth, wherin are hādled diuers other sorts of voluntary omissions of M. Morton, aswell in defending himself, as the credit of his Clients commended vnto him; and namely of Syr Edward Cooke, now Lord Chiefe Iustice.
            8 The eight treateth diuers seuerall points with the sayd Syr Edward Cooke, about two new Prefaces of his lately set forth in print.
            9 The ninth, returning to M. Morton againe, layeth togeather another choice number of new falsities and falshoods made in excuse of the old.
            10 The tenth and last handleth twelue new Challenges made by M. Morton, after the Victory lost.
            There is added for an Appendix in the end, a Case of Equiuocation newly written from England to be resolued, about the false Oath of two Ministers: VVherin there is mention also made of D. Kings Sermon at the Court, vpon the fi

               er, about Rebellion & Equiuocation. In which Treatise of myne, besydes the two said poynts of principall argument handled at large (especially the later, as more capable of varietie in the Treatise therof) a great multitude of falsities were layd open, as vttered by M. Morton; and those so frequent, grosse, and palpable, as they must needes be thought to haue beene both

willfull and witting: the censure wherof notwithstanding, I was content to remitt vnto yow, as presuming more of the integrity of your iudgments in poynts of learning, and matter of fact, then distrusting the sequele of your vnequall, affections, by reason of our difference in religion.
            2. This Treatise M. Morton perusing & fynding himselfe, as it seemeth, not a litle strayned therein, was carried therby into so great & exorbitant a streame of passion, as neyther he could stay himsel

                deuise to set forth a Preamble (for some present remedy) accompanied with a promise of a larger booke, & Reioynder to ensue afterwards. And I do call this a strange deuise, not only, for that I haue not seene the same often practized by any writer lightly, except Syr Edward Cooke (who perhaps by this mans imitation hath answered of late with a Preface of lesse then foure leaues in quarto,

               uideth this whole Preamble into three seuerall parts,
                  Preamb. pag. 2. which he termeth Inquiries. I do deuide (saith he) this Preāble into three Inquiries:M. Mort. diuisiō of his worke
               The first is, what sufficiency & excellency there is in P. R. to make so great an insultatiō: the second, whether he may be thought a sufficient Proctor in this case or no: the third, whether he hath sufficiently performed his taske, eyther for the defence of his cause, or iustification of his cōscience; with a Challenge against him for them both.
            
            4. This is the diuisiō of his Worke, wherby I doubt not, but you will discouer also the vani
               
                  •
               ie, though I should say nothing therof. For 
                  •
               hat he being pressed with a Worke of such 
                  •
               eight, as the argument of my former booke did import, & vrged therin, not only with an ouerthrow of his whole cause, but charged furthermore with a monstrous number of playne wilfull vntruthes, not possible, as they seemed, to be answered, or excused; the iudicious Reader will easily consider, whether this were a tyme to tryfle as he doth, making himselfe an Inquisitour (without commission) & to 
                  •
               rame his first Inqui

of his Aduersarie, and to spend eyght whole Paragraphes, as he doth, therin:Impertinent proceeding. Inquiring first of his witt, then of his memorie, thirdly of his learning in Logicke, fourthly of his skill in Greeke & Hebrue, fifthly of his kind of charitie, sixtly of his modestie, with other like poynts, spēding large discourses vpon euery one of them. Is there any man (I say) so simple or sottish, as not to see the impertinency of this manner of proceeding?
            5. His other two Inquiries are as wisely imploied, and prosecuted as this. For that the second, Whether P. R. may be iudged a competent Aduocate or no, is but a silly discourse, conteyning not full two leaues in all: and the argumēt therof is a ridiculous Dialogue feigned between the Mitigator, and the Moderate Answerer
               
                  •
                The third cōprehēdeth the rest of the booke (which is, of foure partes, three) which may be not vnfittely deuided into the termes of offensiue and d
                     •
                  fensiue warres. For that first to impresse some opinion of manhood in defending himselfe from the imputations layd against him of wilfull falshoods, he taketh vpon him (quite from the argument of the controuersy in hand) to impugne others of like dealing, as namely Cardinall Bellarmine, my selfe, and others: and then hauing made this florish, he cōmeth lastly to his owne defence, in fourteene vntruthes layd against him, and culled by himselfe out of more then fourty obiected by his aduersary, and

no one of them well dissolued by him, as after will appeare. And after all 
                  •
               his, he imagining the feild to r
                  •
               mayne wholy to himselfe, he concludeth all with a new vaunt and fresh Challēge in the ninteenth, and last Paragraph of this his booke, phantasying himselfe to haue had the victory in euery thing that he hath taken in hād to treat. And this being the sūme of M. Mort. new worke, I shall breifly lay forth to your iudgment the methode which I haue thought good to vse for his confutation.
            6. First I haue bin content to follow him into those follyes of his first Inquiry,The methode vsed for M. Mort. confutation. about my wit, memory, learning; skill in Logicke, and the like, confessing willingly the mediocrity therof in all things: but yet shewing by the substance of the po

                  •
               yn drawen to haue leapt ouer grauer matters, to handle such light toyes as these be. For what 
                  •
               mporteth me the disestimatiō, which M. Mort. 
               
                  •
               rofesseth of my wit, memory, or learning; for 
                  •
               o much as the things themselues that are handled (wherin wit and learning are to be shewed) will be better witnesses,Witlesse contentiō about wit. and of more credit with the prudent Reader, then eyther his or my bare wordes or vaunts? Wherfore to them I remit me.
            7. In the second place,Second Inquiry I haue had pacience in like manner (for without pacience it could

not be done) to peruse ouer his second Inquirie consisting of a meere idle fancy and fiction of a Dialogue (as hath bene said) deuised betweene me, & his Aduersary the Moderate Answerer, as though he had fallen out about answering his booke: and me he bringeth in speaking very rudely and vnciuilly thus:
                  See his Preamble pag. 31. Nay, I haue not beene arrogant, but thou hast beene rash and pr
                     •

                     •
                  d Reioynder? Thus goeth his fiction, and it is a very fiction indeed. For the truth is, that when I began my Treatise of Mitigation against M. Mortons fi
                  •
               st exasperating discouery, I knew of no other that was in hand to answere the same: as more largely I haue shewed in the third Chapter of my sayd Treatise.
            8. Moreouer he feigneth vs to reason togeather about itching and scratching, as though the Moderate Answerer had vsed these wordes:
                  Preamble pag. 32. 
               I thinke yow are troubled which the dis

                  rs, of whome you haue said, they itch to be doing and answering M. Attorney: this was also my disease, but I after found a scratch, and so may you. Wherby he seemeth to insinuate as you see, a certayne threat of scratching his aduersarie,Threates of scratches. w
                  •
               en other weapons of more force do faile him. But this I haue answered afterwards in due place, & shewed, that aswell these scratches (meant perhaps of those scolding skirmishes

before mentioned about witt, m
                     •
                  morie, learning, and the like) as also deeper wounds of conuiction of falshoods, and manifest impostures, are like to fall vpon himselfe: and that in so euident a sort, as all the standers by may cleerly see it, and take compassion on him, and of his mā
               ner of fight: wherof I am content to make your selues also, my learned Countrymē, both Iudges and vmpires.
            9. Wherfore fynding so litle substance in these two former Inquiries (for what is added and brought in by me in the second, which are but two particuler cases only concerning our subiect and argument of Rebellion and Equiuocatiō, was borrowed frō the third to make vp some matter wherof to treate:) I do passe to the said third Inquirie, wherin one only exploit being requi

               ed on M. Mortons behalfe, two are attempted, 
                  •
               ut with very euill successe in them both. The 
                  •
               xploit required was, that for so much as M. Morton in this his last Preamblatory reply by abā
               
               
                  •
               oning the principall argument and subiect of 
                  •
               ur former controuersy,What was principally required of M. Mort. and what he performeth. had changed the whole state of the Question by occasion of great multitudes of witting vntruthes obiected against him, he should now haue gone roundly to the matter, and directly, plainly, & substantially haue answered the said imputations: but I foūd him to take a farre other course, allowing to himselfe a more large feild to walke and florish in. And this was first, to seeke out, what likelihood

or appearance of falsities he could fynd in any Roman writer whatsoeuer: then of what Popes in particuler; then of Councels, & their Interpreters: after this againe, against Cardinall Bellarmine, and that in diuers kindes, as namely for calumniating his aduersaries for false allegation of the Fathers, for differing in his opinions frō sundry writers of his owne religion, wherof notwithstanding no one can be proued as after you will see.
            10. Fynally then after all this, he falleth vpon my selfe, pretending to shew that in fourteen seuerall poynts at least he hath taken me tardy, which if he could proue, (as in no one he can) yet all this while, as you see, he walketh without the list of our controuersy cōcerning the defence of his owne falshoods, which he driueth of as long as may be, according to the fashion of those that hauing many deepe woundes are loath to discouer them, or haue them handled. Wherfore this poynt of his owne defence or excuse, which was first in his intention (for this was the cause that made him so hastily to shape out this Preamble) was the last in execution, as least gustfull vnto him: and so he dispatcheth it only in one Paragraph, of ninteene, that he hath in this Preamble, to wit the eyghtenth only: and by all liklyhood would haue pretermitted it wholy if handsomely he might.
            11. But perhaps you will imagin, that he hath holpen somewhat his cause by seeking these diuerticles

frō the purpose, in that he hauing weakned first his aduersaries credit may find better passage to the defence of his owne. But indeed this reckoning falleth not out so, but rather the quite contrary,The cont

               en any one vntruth vpon his aduersary, I meane in that nature that it may be thought witting and willing, which is our only question; he commeth by cōsequence to confirme, and authorize extraordinarily the credit of their integrity in their writings, who haue not giuen place to any least touch of iust reprehension in that behalfe: and by this meanes contrary to his meaning he becōmeth their Encomiast or Prayser, who endeauored to be their calumniatour, rectum ab errore, as oftentimes by Gods prouidence it falleth out.

               rteen charges produced against him, which he thought good to choose out as defensible amongst a farre

                greater nūber. The fourth how he pretermitteh more then other twice fourteene, farre more vrgent and eminent then the rest, without euer so  much as once mentioning them. The fifth contayneth sundry other important omissiōs or pretermissiōs of his, aswell in slipping ouer matters belonging to himselfe, as to the defence of sundry Clients of his, whome he ought to haue defended, especially Syr Edward Cooke now L. Chiefe iustice of the Cōmon Pleas: with whome  there is made a peece of a 
                  •
               euerall reckoning in like manner in a seuerall Chapter, aswell about some things of his set forth before, as also concerning two new Prefaces lately published and prefixed to the sixt and seauēth parts of his Reports.  The seauenth, how in place of clearing himself from aboue fourty old imputatiōs of falshood, he is cōuinced of more thē fifty new, superadded  to the former. And fynally, my eyght Chapter, (which is the tenth and last as they lye in order) doth handle new strange vauntes and challenges of M. Morton, after all this battery, as though nothing had byn sayd against him: wherin I can commend nothing, but his courage, remitting the rest to your better discretions, when ye shall haue read both parts, this being the summe of our whole Concertation.
            
               The reasō of the tytle of this booke.13. There remayneth to say a word or two, cōcerning the reason of the tytle of this my Answere, which is, A quiet & sober Reckoning: wherof I know that your Wisedomes will easily ghesse

the cause, but much more will haue seene it, if ye haue perused ouer this Preāble of M. Morton which is so bitter and sharpe, and ouer eager in many places, as doth easily shew that the man was in great choler when he wrote it. And though I could alleage many exorbitāt speaches of his to this effect throughout the whole booke, yet the beginning and ending shall only serue for proofe therof: the beg

For he saith, that if he do

to a Recantation.
And will ye not take pitty of this mans passion? Or can ye meruayle, why I tooke this tytle of A quiet and sober Reckoning?

               rryed away with the same passion, & with the like impatience haue returned him an Answere in his owne veyne, & character of writing; you do easily see, wherunto this contention would haue growne: but I haue thought best to endeauour the pacification of M. Mortons choler, by a more moderate kynd of conferēce, if it may be, where heat of wordes layd asyde, the truth of matters may peaceably and more calmely be cōsidered. Wherin (as before I said) though I may haue iust cause to suspect your affections: yet can I not distrust your iudgements in a matter of such apparent euidency, as this is, now committed vnto you. Wherin Christ Iesus direct you, to the discouery of that truth in Religion, which only can saue vs all. And so to his protection I commit yow, this 19. of December, 1608.

            THE EPISTLE ADMONITORY TO M.r THOMAS MORTON.
            
               IF your self had not giuen me the example (M. Morton) by wryting to me a seuerall Epistle, termyng it Preamblatorie, it is likely I should not haue troubled you with this Admonitory of mine, as hauing wrytten sufficiently in my precedent Dedicatorie to our two Vniuersyties, concerning the subiect of this our whole Cōtrouersy. But for so much as you doe fyrme & subscribe your said letter thus: Yours to warne, and to be warned, Thomas Morton, and haue put in execution the first part therof by warning me, I presume you wilbe content, the second part be put also in vre, and that you be warned by me. To which 
                  •
               ffect I haue thought best to style this my Epistle an Admonitorie. Now then to the matters that are to be handled therin.

            I would wish also the said Reader to cōsider the last 
                  •
               art of this your Epistle, where you say that you do

conuince me out of my owne Confession, granting, that there is an Equiuocation, which no clause of mentall reseruation can saue from a lye:Preamb. p. 43. & 48.
                and you set yt downe in a different letter, as though they were my wordes. But if the said Reader go to the place, where I do handle this matter, both in the second and seuenth Chapters of this my Answere, he will fynd, that I say no such thing, either in word or sense, but rather the quite contrarie: to wyt, that there is an externall speach (as that of Saphyra in the Actes of the Apostles, for therof was the question) which no mentall reseruation can iustify from a lye, and consequently nor make properlie an Equiuocation, for that it is false in the mynd of the speaker, and so cannot stand with the nature of Equiuocation (that allvvayes must be true) as hath byn largely demonstrated in our Treatise of that matter.
            Which point being once well noted & pōdered by your Reader, he will wonder at your strange vaunting illation made hereupon, that is to say, vpō your owne fiction, when you wryte:
                  About the Equiuocation of Saphyra.
                
               That this one Confession of myne is sufficient to conuince all mē
                  tall Equiuocators to be apparāt lyars. And yet further: That by this you haue obtayned your whole cause in both qu

studie of breuitie to be preferred: & what remayneth to be aduertised to your self, wilbe common also to your Reader, vntill I returne vnto him againe, as a little after in this Epistle I meane to doe, to the end not to weary you ouer much with so manie admonitions to your self. Now then shall I passe to the principall pointes, wherof I thinke you to be admonished.
            Among which, the first & chief is, that you se
                  •
               me greatly to mistake my meaning, or at leastwise my affection in writing against you, as though it were malignāt, contemptuous, despitefull, & full of hatred & auersiō of mind: which Almighty God (I hope) knoweth to be far otherwise:
                  That I am in charity with M. Morton.
                and that I do loue you in Christ Iesus with all my hart, wishing you all good in him & for him, but especially the best good for the saluatiō of your soule: for which I would be cōtent to vndergo any paines or perill whatsoeuer; esteeming also (as they deserue) your good parts & talents, if they were rightly imploied by you to the aduancemēt of Gods truth, as hitherto they seeme to me to haue

               r earnest in my writing, I do assure you, that it proceedeth not from hatred or contempt of your person, but rather from some griefe or indignation of mind, to see you so greatly deceiued, or endeuour to deceiue.

                  Three causes of exasperation.

in greater studies, as scarsely you could haue life or leasure to looke at the varietie of Bookes & Authors that haue written therof, especially concerning the Catholick religion for a thousand yeares togeather, which you grant to be ours, to come forth as it were in his hose and dublet, & challeng the whole Church of God and the whole ranke of profound learned men therof, whose bookes for deep learning, iudgement and varietie of reading, you can not but confesse in truth and modestie, that you are not able to beare after them. And fynallie they are thousands, and you are but one: thy were ould, you are yong: their beards were hoarie and gray, yours is yet red: they wore out their ages with studie, you haue yet but lately begone: they haue had the continuance of many ages, the wit, learning, experience, diligence of all Christian Nations that held the same Religion with them,
                  M. Mort. great presumptiō.
                your prescription of tyme is small, your association of fellowes, Fathers & Doctors, or Councells lesse. For if you goe out of the little Iland of Britany, where all that professe themselues Protestants, in all things are not wholy with you; you shall fynd abroad all the rest in most things against you. And yet do you so confidently tryumph and insult euery where, as though you alone were able to ouercome and vanquish whatsoeuer was established before you in our Religiō different from yours, saying euery where, with contempt, when you speake of this ranke of learned men, and when any thing displeaseth you in them, your owne Bishops, your owne Doctors, your owne Coūcells, your owne

fynding the same to fall out in full measure by the hatefull accident of the powder-treason, you rāne as the Rauen to the fallen sheep to picke out her eyes: that is to say, to adde exasperation to exasperation, affliction to affliction, calumniation to sycophancy against all sortes of Catholicks. And then came forth in hast your litle infamous bloudie Lybell without a name, which out of your charitie would needs make all Catholiks Traytors in the very roote of Catholicisme it self, that is to say, in the fundamentall doctrine of their Religion. So as euerie one of them must be forced to denie his faith in that Religiō, or else acknowledge himself trayterous in his duty of temporall allegiāce and subiection. Which paradox to make somewhat probable, you were forced to accompanie with so manie fraudulent shiftes, deceipts and falsities as haue byn conuinced against yow, in my former Treatise, & cōfirmed now in this: which though of it self it moued no small indignation, to see so many manifest falshoods, so bouldly auouched and ratified againe by you afterwards, as in this fynall reckoning will apeare: yet must I confes

            And it made me also to remember a certaine historie, that I had read in old Lactantius Firmianus in his first booke, intituled De Iustitia, which I shall recite as I fynd it in hym: yow may apply vnto your self so much therof, as yow maie thinke to fit you. The storie is of a certayne

heathen Philosopher, who in tyme of persecution tooke occasion to write against Christian religion. Ego (saith Lactantius) cùm in Bithynia Oratorias litteras accitus docerem &c.

                When as I being sent for, taught Rhetoricke in Bithynia, and the Churches of Christians (by the Edicts of Diocletian & Maximinian) were commanded to be ouerthrowne, a certaine chief Philosopher taking the occasion of that tyme, nescio vtrum superbiùs an importuniùs iacenti atque abiectae veritati insultaret, did insult ouer the truth of Christes Religion oppressed and trodden vnder foot, I know not whether with greater pryde or importunity &c.

And thē saith further: Eodem ipso tempore quo iustus populus nefariè lacerabatur, tres Libros euomuit contra Religionem nomenque Christianum.

And then immediatly addeth: ô Philosophum adulatorem, ac tempori seruientem! O flattering Philosopher and tymeseruer! A fit encomium for such an enterprise.

                  •
               f the lye of Saphyra which she made to S. Peter
               
in the Actes, of the Apostles, and supposing yt to be an Equiuocation, which I deny; you say in the title of the Paragraph,
                  Act. 5.
                
               that I my selfe do flatly ouerthrow therby my whole defence of mentall Equiuocation, which (say you) is made so euident, as no wit of man can possibly excuse it. And yet when the matter commeth to be tried, euery meane wit may easely perceaue, that you vnderstood not, or mistooke of purpose the question, as afterward in this Answere is declared. And yet do you insult strangly saying:Preamb. pag. 48.
                
               Where is now P.R. &c. where is this Man, the new select Aduocate for this cause? May he not say hereafter, I was ashamed, and therfore hid my selfe, so naked doth his deformity appeare. And yet further you say:
                  A fond insultatiō.
                
               He being pressed with this example out of Scripture (to wit of Saphyra her speach to S. Peter) is driuen into such a vertigo and giddines, that euen when he would defend his art of Equiuocating from a lye, he is by consequence from Gods word forced to confesse, that there is an outward speach, which noe clause of Reseruation can saue from a lye: wherby his owne Magi, I doubt not, wilbe brought to acknowledge, that Digitus Dei est hic, this is the power of Gods truth.
            
            This is the adoe you make, M. Morton, about this example of Saphyra, adding also presently, that by this, you haue obtained your whole cause. But in truth you haue obtained to make

your selfe ridiculous therby, as you handle it. For what is there in this matter that should cause me to runne away, and hyde my selfe, as you do feigne, and not dare to appeare, when you call so earnestly vpon me? What haue you proued? What haue you conuinced against me? You say that her words to S. Peter (I haue sould it for no more) was no lesse an Equiuocation, then to say, I am no Priest. But I deny it, and do say it was a lye, and no Equiuocation. For that she had obligation to vtter the truth to S. Peter that was her lawfull Iudge, and so hath not the Priest, that is demanded by him, who is not his lawfull Iudge.
            You say that,Preamble. p. 48.
                
               I being pressed with this example out of Scripture frō Gods Word
                     •
                   am forced to confesse an outward speach, which no clause of reseruation can saue from a lye. Wherto I answere, that no force of example frō Gods Word is needfull for this. For euer it was graunted, and so must be, that there be infinite outward speaches, which no mentall reseruation cā saue from lyes, if there be obligation to tell the truth, as in the case of Saphyra there was. And therefore for you to bring in the Magi wondering here at the power of God inforcing me to such a vertigo, is both Comicall and ridiculous indeed.
            And yet by the way I must further put you in mind
                  •
                that you do deliuer me heere from a contradiction, and inuolue your selfe in a falshood

vnanswerable in reciting of these words of mine. For that before in your Epistle to my selfe you recite my Confession thus:
                  M Morton taken in an open contradictiō.
                
               That there is a mē
                  tall Equiuocation which no clause of reseruation can saue from a lye. And here you say: I am forced to confesse an outward speach, which no clause of reseruation can saue from a lye. Betweene which two recitalls there is great difference, as before we haue shewed, & no lesse then betweene truth and falshood. So as if you write truly heere, you spake falsely before: and if truly before, then falsely now. And thus much haue I byn inforced to admonish you of at this time, by the peruersity of your owne words and manner of writing.
            Many other things I should haue to warne M. Morton of, in this point concerning his mā

            Let vs see his second defence, for this first standeth only vpon his owne confidence. Secōdly
               
(saith he) from my aduersary, tooke I matter of comfort, presuming that he that would write in defence of mentall Equiuocation, would be found to equiuocate in writing also. This you see is but a presumption, and that a very poore one. For as a man may write of warre and yet not fight; and of Agriculture or husbandry, and yet neither plow nor sow:
                  His strong presumption.
                So may he write of Equiuocation, and yet not Equiuocate, and Equiuocate also and yet not lye. So as this could be but a silly comfort for M. Morton to presuppose and hope that I would Equiuocate in writing of Equiuocation, which was not needfull. And if I had; yet might I do it without lying: and so nothing therby haue relieued his case, that was so deeply charged with that fault. And finally, if I had bene able to be conuinced of any point in that kind (as afterward you will see that I was not:) yet S. Augustines rule is, Quod societas peccantium auget potiùs quàm excusat peccatum: Fellowship in sinne increaseth rather then excuseth the fault. Though truly it may se
                  •
               me that M. Morton would highly esteeme this fellowship with me, if he could bring it about, and thinke himselfe well defended, if he could attaine it. Which I am lead to belieue, not only by his labour, diligence & solicitude therin, but by the last Conclusion of his for
                  •
               named Epistle to my self, which he endeth thus for an vpshoot.
            
               I may thinke (saith he) the Scripture verified vpon you, where it is thus written:

Therfore art thou inexcusable (O man) whosoeuer thou be, that iudgest:
               Rom. 2. vers. 1.
                
               for doing the same thinges, by iudging an other, thou condemnest thy selfe.
            
            Out of which text of the Apostle M. Morton would proue,
                  M. Mort. seeketh some association.
                that I doing the same things with him (in this point of fraud and false dealing) I cannot condemne him, without condemning also my selfe: which consequence I grant, but deny the antecedent. Which I assure my self M. Morton will neuer be able to proue in any one point of moment, throughout this whole concertation of ours; himselfe being taken faultie almost at euery turne, as you will see.
            And yet doth he vaunt, as though his integritie were extraordinary in this behalfe, telling vs, that as the Greeke Cōmaunder being in appa

                     •
                  prightly answered himself, that his cause was 
                     •
                  afe and his conscience sound, began more resolutely to confront me.
            
            Thus you see, that he hath cleared himselfe, & is become victorious vpon a suddayne by force of a similitude only. And in truth the tale is pretily told by him in wordes, but let vs come to the substance of the things. If M. Mortons cause be so safe, and his conscience so sound, how

do there stand togeather afterward in the sixt Chapter of this my Answere, aboue thirty vntruths,
                  The multitude of M. Mortons vntruthes.
                pretended to haue bin wittingly pretermitted by him in his last Preamblatorie Reply, as vnanswerable? & now aboue fiftie more newly added out of the said Reply, which are set downe in my seauenth Chapter? If these can be really defended by him, he doth somewhat. And for diuers of them, he ought to haue done it before. But if they cannot (as I assure my selfe without making of more new, they cannot) then is neither M. Mortons cause safe, nor his conscience sound in this behalfe. Nay his sheild and buckler is vtterly broken, and his Cittie of refuge quite ouerthrowne.
            
               
                  In the same Epistle dedicatory.

            And by this you see, that M. Morton is still doing, whether well or euill, God knoweth. I maruaile he feareth not the scratch due to his ytch, wherof he speaketh in his Preamble. For if out of Germanie there come that multitude of scratches, that is threatned by him whose letter I haue mentioned in the latter end of this Answere, & do ioyne themselues with these scratches of myne, both old and new, that do march togeather in this my answere against him, they

are like to make a great squadron And M. Morton will haue his hands full in defending himselfe from them, and in procuring, that of scratches and scarres they do not be

whole Paragraphes; which yet are such, as draw noe bloud, nor doe scarre any man, but the scratcher himselfe, as by further examination it will appeare. For first, what doth he gaine to his cause, if he could prooue indeed, that his Aduersarie had scarcitie both of witt, memorie, learning, Greeke, Hebrew, Logike, and other abilities heere mentioned? Were not his victorie the lesse in ouercōming so weake an aduersarie? And were not his shame the greater, yf he should be ouercome by him? Yes truly.

Mortons intention being, or ought to be, principally to satisfy the charges and imputations of falshood, and vntrue dealing, layd vnto him in the Treatise of Mitigation; (for hastening whereunto, for that they raysed great scarres in the readers eye, he omitted to handle any thing at all of the chief argument of that Treati

Paul to Timothie) and yet vnderstand not what they say, nor whereof they assirme. But whether this description of fond presumptuous doctors touched by S. Paul, doe agree rather to Protestant ministers, or to Catholicke Priests, will appeare in great part, by reading ouer this booke, especially the 5.8. and 10. Chapters, yf by Thomas Mortons errours and ignorances, a scantling may be taken of the rest. But now lett vs see, how he doth goe about to prooue, that our priests are such bad doctors as S.

in the opinion of a neuer-erring Priesthood (which confirmed that answer) could not possibly but erre with their priests: such alas, is the case of all them &c. Doe you see how substā
                        tially he hath prooued the matter? Let vs examine the particulers: first the storie, then the inference.
                     5. About the storie S. Matthew recounteth in the 28. Chapter of his Ghospell,The story of the sleping soldiers. Matth. 28. how Christ our Sauiour being raised miraculously from death to life, with a great and dreadfull earthquake, and descent of an Angell, so as the souldiers, that kept the Sepulcher were astonished and almost dead for feare, some of them ranne and tould the chiefe Priests therof: who making a consultation with the Elders, deuised this shift to giue them store of money, and to bid them say, that in the night, when they were asleepe, his Disciples came and stole him away, and so they did. And S. Matthew addeth, that this false brute ranne currant among the Iewes, euen vntill that time, wherin he wrote his Ghospell. This is the narration; what hath now Thomas Morton to say against vs? for therunto is all his drift.
                     6. First he saith, as you haue heard, that this deuise was improbable and against common sense it sel
                              •
                           e. Common sense (saith he) might haue replied (to the souldiers) what could you tell what was donne, when you were all asleep? See heere the sharpnesse of Tho. Mortons witt, aboue that of the Priests; Scribes, & Pharisies.How men may know what is donne whē they are asleep
                              •
                           
                         But what yf one of the soldiers had replyed to him thus: wee saw it not, when we were asleepe, but afterward when we were awakened, we perceyued that he was stolen away; what r
                           •
                        ioynder would our Minister make? As for example, yf Tho. Morton were walking with a cōmunion booke vnder his 
                           ••
                        me through a field, and wearied should lye downe to sleepe, with his booke by his side, and at his awaking should see his booke gone, were it against common sense for

him to say, that his booke was stolen from him, while he was asleepe? or is not this an assertion fit for one of those doctours, wherof S. Paul talketh, that vnderstand not what they say, or wherof they affirme? But this will better yet appeare by the second part, which is his inference: wherfore we must a little also examine that.
                     7. But mindes (sayth he) enthralled in the opinion of a neuer-erring priesthood (which confirmed that answer) could not possibly but erre with their Priests: such, alas, is the case of all them &c. The malicious man would deface Christian priesthood by the Iewish priesthood, and our priests by theirs: but consider how farre he runneth from the marke in both. Minds enthralled (sayth he) in the opinion of a neuer-erring priestood, which confirmed that answere. &c. Did the priesthood of Iewry cōfirme this answer? who sayth so? wee read that the priests with the Elders did deuise this answer, and they knew they did euill and lye therin: and so did the soldiers also that published the same.
                     8. But this was a matter of fact, not a determination of faith. Neyther among the Iewes, nor Christians, was there euer opiniō that Priestes or Priesthood could not erre in matters of fact, life, or their manners. How then is this to the purpose? Or doth not this also prooue him to be one of those forenamed Doctors that vnderstand not what they say, or wherof they affirme? How much more modestie, and pietie had it bin in Tho. Morton to haue followed the example of Christ and his Apostles, who though persecuted by those Priestes, yet both thought and spake reuerently of their Priesthood.

                  9. Thus much I wrote in my former Treatise of Mitigation,
                     
and this discourse of myne is the argument wherby M. Morton concludeth against my witt, as you haue heard, and in his answere calleth this my speach two or three times wittlesse. But for that I respect not so much witt, as truth in this affaire, I am cō
                     tent to remit my selfe to the Reader, who perhaps is wyser then vs both, and will see what folly it is so vnwisely to contend about the commendation of our wittes. But let vs friendly & soberly (M. Morton) see your discharge and make the reckoning according to reason:

                     now by any certaynty that Christ his disciples came and stole him away,The souldiers speach was against truth, but not common sense and therfore they did both fondly and wickedly in auouching and testifying the same for certayne and true. But S. Austine doth not say as you say, that the deuise was against common sense, for then it would not haue ben belieued so generally for so many yeares after, as S. Matthew insinuateth that it was vnto his tyme when he wrote his ghospell; nor would the Priests, Doctors, and principall Iewes of the Synagogue, which had not only

common sense but worldly wisedome also, eyther haue deuised this shift, or haue gyuen money to haue it published, or would they haue suffered the same to haue bene proposed to their Gouernour Pilate for contēting him, who being a Romā & a wise worldly man, would neuer haue harkened vnto it or admitted the same, if the proposition had bene against common sense & reason, as M. Morton affirmeth.
                  11. Besides this, if some of vs, euē the wisest amōg vs should imagin our selues to haue bene with the Iewes and Gentils in Hierusalem at that time, and wanting the light of faith, should haue heard a company of watch-men affirme vnto vs, that a certaine man estemed and followed by many in his life time, and afterwards slaine, buried, and watched by them at his Sepulcher, and at the third day to haue bene sodenly gone from thence, & not to be found; What would worldly reason (that neuer dreamed of resurrection) haue suggested in this case,An euidēt example. but that some of his followers amongst so many as Christ was knowne to haue had in his life time, had come and secretly taken him away? Had not this bene probable in such a case to mans discourse? had this bene against common sense to haue alledged this excuse? who will say so, that is indued with common sense? But (sayth M. Morton) the soldiers could not know at leastwise if he were stolne away his disciples had done it; which I grant that they could not know it for certaine, but by probability only, which probability notwithstanding was very great, for that his enemyes would not haue aduentured to do it with so great danger, ergo, it is likely they were his frends and followers, schollers and disciples. And is not this probable? is this repugnant to common sense and reason, as M. Morton affirmeth?
                  12. But it was (saith he) a lie: I grant, & that many lyes are more probable then some truthes; the questiō
                     
then is, whether it were a probable lye, or else so absurd, as it repugned to common sense? The former I affirmed, the later is M. Mortons position, who houldeth me for witlesse, for saying the contrarie: for so he writeth againe a little after the former: Howsoeuer (sayth he) it be, sure I am P.R. hath shewed himselfe very

R. who hath bewrayed his singuler sottishnesse in the inference wherin he meant to giue vs a speciall argument of his witt. This is somewhat sharp, as you see, but I pardon easily the passion: some words must be allowed to leesers: lett the summe of the Reckoning be this,The vpshot of the reckoning that wheras we all doe agree, that the soldiers speach was

false, M. Morton holdeth further, that it was senselesse and against common reason, and my selfe witlesse for affirming, that it had any sense or probabilitie therin. Lett the prudent Reader iudge, where the witt lieth.

                  About the clause of reseruatiō vttered in Latin.AFTER the impugnation of my Witt, M. Morton taketh vpon him to disgrace my Memorie, intituling his second Paragragh thus: An argument of the rare Memorie of P. R. bewraying his free will to lying; & then beginneth he the sayd Paragraph in these words:
To make me seeme ridiculously cautelous (sayth he)  as intending wheresoeuer their equiuocating forgerie was to be spoken of, to keepe the clause of mentall reseruation vnder a latin locke, and not Englished, least weak-ones might learne to practice that Magicall art, P. R. sayth, that Thom. Morton, though he promised to put it downe alwaies in Latin, so as it should not be vnderstood by the vulgar Reader, yet hath he not (to his remēbrāce) set downe the said clause of reseruation in Latin, but once through all his booke of full satisfaction, and that in foure wordes in the second page therof, the said reseruation being mētioned in English more perhaps, then fortie tymes.
                  
Out of which words of mine, M. Morton indeauoreth to inferre manie falsities, and absurdities against me, both of bad Memorie and worse Will: for that, as he sayth, the said Clause of Reseruation is foūd to haue bene set downe by him in Latin, not onely once, as I say, but more then twentie tymes in his Treatises of equiuocation. Whereunto I answer, that albeit, that all this were granted; yet is the matter idle, and of no importance, yea a meere cauill, for

                     ion, in such sort, as the ignorant of the Latin tongue should not vnderstand the same, and consequently that he would shut it vp vnder a Latin lock: And yet now in this his Preamble he sayth, that I goe about to make him seeme so ridiculously cautelous, as to intend to keepe the sayd clause of mentall Reseruation, vnder a Latin lock, least weake ones might learne &c. Are not these two plaine contradictory assertions out of one mouth? to witt, that he will keepe the clause of Reseruation vnder a Latin lock, and that he neuer meant to locke it vp?

Where was his Memorie, when he wrote this to impugne my Memorie?
               
               17. But yet further it may please you to note the word (allwayes) when he sayth in his former Epistle to the Kings Ma.•y that allwaies the sayd clause of Reseruatiō was deliuered in latin, and yet he confesseth in this verie place, that 3. or 4. tymes he setteth it downe in 
                     •
                  nglish. And was not this a slipp of his Memorie in like māner, to say and promise to his Ma.ty that he would set it downe allwayes in Latin: and yet presently to confesse, that sometymes he did it in English? Thirdly, he saith, as you haue heard, that he hopeth, his booke of Equiuocation so to be published as Aristotles naturall Phylosophy, to witt, so published, as not published, in respect, that the vnlearned should not vnderstand him. And how could he thinke this, if sometymes at leastwise (as he confesseth) he vttered all in English, and this to English men? Can these things stand togeather? Where was his Memorie, when he wrote this?
               18. So as hauing now shewed M. Mortons Memorie not to haue bene good in all these 3. points, I shall passe to speake of mine, which willingly I confesse to be bad: wherevpon he triumpheth against me, for that I say (as before you haue heard) that the clause of Reseruation to my remembrance was not set downe in Latin, but once throughout all M. Mortons book
                        •
                     , though in English the said Reseruatiō were mētioned more (perhaps) thē fourtie times. Against which assertion of mine he stormeth excedingly, and quoteth in his margent for cōfutatiō thereof, diuers & sundry places where the said clause is set downe in latin, as where it is said, He knoweth not any thing so, vt teneatur detegere: or I know it not so,Preamb. p. 6. 
                  vt tibi dicam, vel, vt tibi reuelem &c. and sundry other like places he alledgeth, where albeit the externall part of the proposition be set downe in English,

R. in this matter. promising that he would allwayes so sett downe the clause of Reseruation in Latin, that the simple Reader should not vnderstand it, no more then simple men could vnderstand Aristotles Philosophy; in which manner I found it put downe but once indeed, throughout his whole booke,

Mort. the first, That euery equiuocation by a mentall reseruation is not a hidden truth, but a grosse lye. The second, That euery Equiuocation, whether mentall or verball, if it be vsed in an oath (to any person whatsoeuer) though it be no lye in it selfe, yet is it an abhominable profanation of that sacred institution of God.

                     24. The absurdity and folly of this second proposition (say I) appearing so manifestly in itselfe, as it doth (by our precedent proofes) what should we stād to examin the argumēts & reasōs that may be brought for it,
                           Mitigat. pag. 472. nu. 48. by so fond a disputer, as now Thomas Morton is proued to be? For so much as no reason can s

                        rue for vphoulding a paradox so ridiculous as this is, euē to common sense. And yet for that he putteth downe

foure arguments, or reasons for the same as before hath byn said: let vs see breifly what they are.
                     
                        First argument25. His first argumēt for this cōclusion is drawne from the forme of an oath, set downe by vs before, and heere againe alledged by him out of Tolet and other Authors of ours (for of his owne he seemeth to haue none,) That an oath is a religious inuocation of God, eyther expresly, or by implication,

                     26. Now then out of this principle T. M. taketh vpon him to proue this proposition; That whensoeuer, or to whomsoeuer we sweare, we are bound in conscience to answere directly, that is to say, to sweare to his intention, to whome we sweare: which we haue proued before by generall consent of Deuines and lawyers to be false,A false principle and generall proposition. and Cicero him selfe hath so determined the case in like māner, as you haue heard, whē a man should be cōpelled to sweare to thieues: but yet let vs heare how T. Morton will proue this his new and strange Deuinitie. His Syllogisme is this in his owne wordes.
                     The competency of God (sayth he) by whome we sweare, maketh euery one competent Iudges, and heares to whome we sweare.
                           Pag. 86: The absurd syllogisme of T. M neither true in forme nor matter.
                        
                     
                     But by swearing by God whome we cannot deceaue, we religiously protest that in sweariug we intend not to deceaue.
                     
                        Ergo, Our deceiptfull Equiuocating is a prophanation of the religious worship of God.

                     rence was nothing to this purpose at all, as the Reader will see, yf he consider my wordes. For I spake of an inference that might be further made vpon your argument reformed by me, but not as it came from you: and this I spake also of the consequence of matter, and of the truth of the proposition in controuersie, but not of the forme, which being naught could neuer be made good by any inference, and therefore it is verie absurd that you say, that I am offended with you, for deliuering the matter in grosse, which deuided into his partes, was good reasoning; for that neither in grosse, nor in partes can the argument be defended. And the similitude of two pence and two single pence, is not worth a half-penny for sauing of your credit in this behalfe, as the Reader will easily perceaue.
                  38. VVell then, hauing thus cleered the Reckoning about this principall point,M. Mort. presumeth not to defēd his syllogisme. that you cannot anie way defend the forme of your syllogisme, either by denyall, or by vnderpropping the same, with anie kind of shiftes, you bend your self wholie to finde some faultes in the reformation therof by me, as though it were a full iustification of you, if you could find out any ouersight in me, and therfore you note many poyntes of small, or no importance at all; and the most of them meere cauills or

against your se
                        •
                     fe, as now will appeare. For first I meaning to put in some order and forme your said syllogisme (which your self heere dare not so much as take vpon you to defend) rather then to make any new of myne owne, I reteyned your whole Maior proposition, which is this as before hath bene set downe: The competency of God by whom wee sweare, maketh euery one competent Iudges to whom wee sweare; which proposition I do shew at large to be false in matter and substance, as in part yow haue heard: yet do I retayne it (as I sayd) wholy for the Maior proposition as it came from you, and in this Maior did I necessarily vnderstand the wordes (expresly or implicatiuely) for that your selfe had set them downe expresly in the same place, within 3. lynes before, out of the definition of an Oath; so as the full meaning of this Maior proposition is, that the Competency of God by whome (eyther expresly or implicatiuely) we sweare, maketh euery one competent Iudges to whom we sweare.
                     The reformatiō of M. M. syllogisme. And then secondly for that your two other propositions of the same argument, to wit, the Minor & Conclusiō, had no coherence at all with this Maior, and consequently could inferre nothing therupon, as I did shew in my answere; I was forced to change them wholy for bringing the argument to true forme of syllogisme, saying in the Minor thus: But in euery Oath we sweare by God, eyther expresly or implicatiuely; ergo, in euery Oath they are competent Iudges to whom we sweare.
                  
                  39. But against this reformation of myne you are so impatient, as maketh me take new compassion of you indeed: For it seemeth you care not much to wound your selfe, so it might be thought that therwith yow scratched also me. But let vs heare what you do obiect. First (say yow) th

                     ut three. Wherto I answere with remēbrāce of that story of the enuious man, who being offered by a Iudge to haue double punishmēt decreed against his aduersary, for any that he would take vpō himselfe, chose to haue one of his owne eyes pulled out, so as his aduersary might leese both of his, which how far it may be applyed to this fact of M. Mort. the disapassionate Reader will discern.
                        T. Mort. woundeth deeply himself to scratch his aduersary. For heere to find out fiue terminos of this syllogisme (which hath in deed but three) he will needs assigne three in the only Maior proposition, which is verbatim his owne, and nothing changed by me, but set downe as I found it in him; so as if this his maior proposition haue thr
                        •
                     e terminos, as heere he auoucheth, then did he with all his skill in Logicke, yea hauing byn a publicke Reader and Maister therof, make a Maior with three terminos, and a proposition with more then one subiectum, and one praedicatum, which is the grossest ouersight in Logicke that can be ymagined; nor any meane scholler of foure moneths study in Sophistry indeed would commit the same, Aristotle hauing assigned,
                        Arist. l.

                  40. So as to seeme to haue noted me of somewhat he is content to accuse himself of a grosse errour in deed, yea and that falsly also against himself: for that his maior proposition had not indeed, nor hath three termini, but only tvvo, as it should haue: to witt, one subiectā
                      that goeth before the verbe or copula, and one praedicatum that followeth the same: for that the first part of his said maior, the Competency

whome wee sweare, maketh not two termini but one, as the other later part following the verbe or copula, to witt (maketh) euery one competent Iudges to whome wee sweare, is but one praedicatum. And M. Morton is grosly deceaued in appoynting out di
                        •
                     ferent wordes, for different termini:A grosse error in Logick against him self. for if there were a dozen wordes or more going before the verbe, & as many following tending all to one affirmation or negation, they should all according to prescript of Logick be but two only termini. As for example, If I should say, Euery man in that he is indued with a soule, that is a spirit, adorned with reason, prouidence, freewill, and such other qualityes may be compared to an Angell &c. All these wordes going before the verbe make but one terminus, and consequently M. Mortons appointing the word Competency for one terminus, and God by whome we sweare for an other, which stand but for one subiectum in the maior propositiō, & do tend but to one simple af
                        •
                     irmatiō, cōmitteth more then a grosse error in Logick: as also he doth in that other obseruation of his, wherby he noteth the last wordes of the minor proposition (eyther expresly or implicatiuely) for a fifth seuerall terminꝰ, wheras in deed they are but a part of the medius terminus which was the subiectum of the former maior proposition, necessarily there vnderstood, and that out of M. Mortons owne wordes, as before is sayd. But yet let vs heare how he goeth forward to reprehend what he seemeth not to vnderstand well himselfe.
                  41. Secondly (saith he) these wordes (the Competency) being part of the medium,Preamb. p. 9. 
                     should haue beene repeated in the minor proposition. Wherto I answere that it is sufficient that they be necessarily, and vertually included, and vnderstood by the hearer, as they are in our minor: for when we inferre thus, but in euery Oath we sweare by God, though we omit to say, who is compe

Iudge of all, or, hath competency of iudgement ouer all, as in the Maior is expressed; yet euery man will vnderstand and supply it by himself, as in the forementioned

                     yllogisme, Euery man as he is indued with a soule, 
                           •

                           •
                        ells: but Peter is a man, ergo he may be compared to Angells. Is not this a good syllogisme? And should it not be so taken in publicke disputations, though all the wordes of the former subiectum, or medius terminus were not repeated in the minor, but onely the word, Man, that includeth necessarie relation to all the rest, to wit, as he is indued with a soule &c? I thinke yes. And so I suppose all Logicians in Cambridge would affirme against M Morton in this behalf.
                  42. Lastly then this third or finall quarrell against this reformed syllogisme is proposed by him thus:A third cauill turned wholy against himself. Preamb. p. 10. Mitig. p. 475. Thirdly (saith he) there should be but one minus extremum; but with this, we sweare by God, he hath ioyned another, to wit, either expressely or implicatiuely, which wordes being a part of the minus extremum should not haue bene omitted in the conclusiō. So he. But M. Morton must be content we tell him heere friendly, that not to speake of skill or learning, he hath shewed at least much lesse attention, then in anie other point before about this matter. For that the words, VVe sweare by God, are not put by me for the minus extremum or subiectum of the minor proposition, but for a part of the praedicatum, & consequently for a part of the medius terminus of the whole syllogism
                        •
                     , as also the wordes expresly or implicatiuely are another part of this medius terminus, and therfore by law of a good syllogisme are well left out in the conclusion, which M. Morton inconsideratly reprehendeth. I will pretermitt heere manie scurill syllogismes which you (M. Morton) haue delighted your self to frame out of your owne imagination,

about dronken penitentes, shauen crownes, and the like,M. Mort. absurd scurrility which are not worthie the repetition: onelie we may not omitt for the vpshot of all, to see how your self do now reforme your former owne syllogisme after better deliberation had, & my admonitiō vnto you cōsidered. For finally you frame it thus:

                        Euerie speach wherin we sweare by God, either expressely or implicatiuely, doth by the competencie of God, by whome we sweare, make the iudges competent, vnto whome we sweare:
                        But euerie Oath is a speach, wherein we sweare by God, either expressely or implicatiuely:
                        
                           Ergo, euerie Oath doth by the competencie of God by whome we sweare, make the iudges competent to whome we sweare.
                     
                  
                  43. This is the last, & most absolute forme, whereunto M. Morton hath reduced finally his former argument: which yf you examine well, you shall find it to be the verie same in effect with mine. And first I would haue the Reader to note,M. Mort. brought to cōfesse his errour in his former syllogisme. that of the 3. propositions, which he sett downe in his former old syllogisme, he heere casteth away two, without so much as mentioning them, to witt, the minor and conclusion, which had in them, as before hath bene shewed, foure distinct terminos, that is, two subiecta & two praedicata, without anie combination or coherence the one with the other, whereof they being conuicted, M. Morton thinketh best now not onely not to defend them, but not so much, as to mentiō them in this his new and last reformed syllogisme, consenting thereby manifestly to their former reiection, and condemnation made thereof by me. And then secondly for his first or maior proposition, which I for his sake reteyned wholy in my reformation,

as I found it set downe by him, he hath so altered the same here in this his last refining, and so charged it with so many new additiōs of wordes and clauses, as yf his owne new rule may take place, that euerie distinct clause must be held for a distinct terminus, 
                        •
                     t will not onely haue two, but 4. or 5. termim at least: and so will the Reader find by looking only vpon it. And I vvould prosecute the matter more at large, but I see vve haue spent to much time about these trifles: yet could I do no lesse, for that M. Mort. would needes take the matter with such eagernesse, as you haue heard, and appeale to all Vniuersities both Christian and Heathen, for tryall of the matter, yea impawne his hood, habit, degree and credit therein: by which occasion I haue bene forced to say more then otherwise I would, or thought the matter worthie.
                  44. The finall Reckoning then of this accompt is found to be this;The finall rekoning of this Paragraph. that notwithstanding all M. Mort. clamour and outcry in this matter, he hath not bene able to defend his former syllogisme either in matter or forme, but by shamefull denying (in the later) that which he cannot stand vnto, nor yet impugne my reformation therof, but by setting downe the verie selfsame in effect and substance, that I did before; and that the faultes which he deuiseth, doe fal
                        •
                      vpon his owne syllogisme, as you haue heard demonstrated, wherby the Reader will see, in what danger his pawne lieth in the Vniuersity, yf rigour of iustice should be exacted. But yet will he not giue ouer nor cease, but hath another assault against me about a certaine diuision or rather subdiuision of Equiuocatiō made by me (as he pretendeth) against the lawes of Logike: which though it be of verie little importāce in respect of our cause; yet wil we giue it also some place of examination among other his trifles proposed.

Morton hath to find out some probable matter against me in this point or Logicall skill (wherin himselfe presumeth much) may appeare not onely by that you haue now heard him write about the defēce of his syllogisme (which yet he defēdeth not) but also by another trifling qua

                     Mitigat. c. 12. p. 485. and vnlawfull. Lawfull when the speaker hath a true meaning and lyeth not, though he be not alwayes so vnderstood by the hearer; and that this sort only of Equiuocation is vsed by Catholikes vpō iust occasions: the other is vnlawfull, when the speaker lieth, and meaneth wrōgfully to deceyue his hearer; and that this second sort is practized euerie where by Protestant wryters in England, by M. Morton, and his fellowes, as I doe shew by manie examples throughout that whole Chapter, which M. Morton leauing wholie vnanswered, taketh vpon him only to impugne the manner or forme of a certaine subdiuision made by me of this secōd kind of false Equiuocation,

                  47. Wherfore (said I) all our speach in this place shalbe about the second kind of Equiuocatiō,

which though not properly, yet in a general māner, may be called Equiuocation, as I haue said, for that the hearer is allwayes wrongfullie deceaued, or intended

to be deceaued by some falsitie, which is knowne to be such by the speaker, and consequently is plaine lying. And for that lying hath byn shewed also be

This kind of Equiuocation, Two sortes of lying Equiuocation. which reallie is a lye, must haue also the same subdiuision, so as the one sort thereof may be called a mat
                              •
                           riall lying Equiuocation, & the other formall, and so much worse, as a formall lye is in it self (which all wayes is sinne) then a materiall (which oftentimes may be without sinne of the speaker) by so much is a formall lying Equiuocation worse then a materiall. Wee shall giue examples of both, that shall make all playne.
                  
                  48. Thus farre it pleased M. Mort. to cite my words, excepting only the last, mentioning the examples to make all playne, which he thought best to suppresse, for that perhapps he desired not to much playnesse in this matter. Wherefore I haue thought good to supplie them here, to the end that the Reader may see the whole tenor of my speach, & therby conceaue how litle to the purpose this Cauill is, which M. Morton hath sought out to handle in this place. It followeth then in my booke.
                  
                     49. If one should said to me (quoth I) that my Father is dead,
                           Mitigat. p. 485. n. 5. thinking in deed that he is dead, though he be aliue, it were a materiall lye, as before hath byn declared, for that indeed, though he perhaps that made the lye may haue sayd it with out sinne, for that he thought it so: and I say (perhappes) for that in some case, ignorance could not excuse him, if it were a matter wherof he were boūd to know the truth, and might with diligence haue

                        
                           •
                        earned the same. But if he should saie my Father is dead knowing in deed that he is not dead, and meaning to deceaue me thereby, this is a formall lye,A materiall & formall lye, and the difference and alwayes sinnefull, either veniall or mortall, according to the importāce of the matter, wherin the lye is made. And conforme to this may be the diuision also (as is said) of lying Equiuocation, that the one be materiall, the other formall.
                  
                  
                     50. Examples of the first may be these, & other like. An Arian deliuereth to the people those wordes of Christ, Pater mens maior me est, my Father is greater then I, vnderstanding it heretically according to their meaning of the very God head; this is an Equiuocation,Materiall false Equiuocation. and in his sense is false, and consequentlie a lye, for that the hearer is deceaued: and yet because the speaker perhappes thinketh it to be true, the lye is but materiall in the Arian, and not formall, & in that respect lesse synne then if it were formall: but yet is it dannable by another way, for that this error, (as hath byn said) being willfullie defended against the Church, is not excusable.
                     51. The other sort of false Equiuocation called formall
                        
                           •
                         is when the hearer cōceaueth any false thing vpon the speach of another, which other knoweth it also to be false and so vttereth a lye against his owne knowledge, and conscience. As for example: If a preacher in England who indeed is no Protestant in harte,Formall false Equiuocation what it is. should preach Protestant doctrine that is false, and himself should thinke it also to be false (as diuers perhaps do,) this were to Equiuocate both falsely, and formallie, which is the worst kind of lying Equiuocation that may be: and this is that, which I saie, that Thomas Mort. and his fellowes, who inueigh bitterlie euerywhere, against true and lawfull Equiuocation, doe vse almost at

                           Mitigat. p. 485. and materiall Equiuocation, for that the matter deliuered is vntrue: and secondlie it is most probable that Tho. Morton must needes knowe it to be a lie, hauing seene so many authors and reasons alleadged for it by the Catholike Treatise, which he pretēdeth to confute: wherof it followeth, that it was a formal lye also, & a formall lying equiuocation in the highest degree of deceipt and falshood.
                     53. Hitherto did I write before, and my purpose was, as here is, euident to distinguish only two kindes of lying Equiuocation,
                        Two sortes of lying Equiuocation. the one most grieuous, which I call formall, the other lesse heynous, tearmed by me materiall, and both of them vsuallie practised by Protestants in their wrytings. And for so much as both of them are false, & in substance ly

                  55. First then where I doe say (as you haue heard) that this second kind of vnlawfu
                        •
                     l Equiuocation vsed by Protestants (being alwaies a lye) may bee diuided, like a lye it selfe, into a materiall lying Equiuocation and a formall, M. Morton omitting craftely the word Equi
                           •
                        ocation in the members diuident, diuideth the same into a materiall and formal lye, as though there were no difference at all betweene thē, & therof frameth this inference, that for so much as a materiall lye is when the lyer knoweth not that hee lyeth, as the formal lyer doth,A manifest fraud. it followeth that a materiall Equiuocator knoweth not when hee doth equiuocate: & yet, sayth hee, haue I defined this second kind of Equiuocation common to both membres, that it is then when the speaker knoweth that he doth falsly equiuocate,
                     
which definition must agree to both.
                  56. This then is a deceipt in M. Morton, that should haue diuided false Equiuocation into formall and materiall Equiuocation, and not into formall and materiall lying, for that albeit betwene materiall lying and materiall equiuocating (for example sake) there be some pointes, wherin they agree (as namely and principally that in the substance of the matter vttered, the speaker thinketh that hee sayth a truth:) yet are there some other points also wherin they differ, as namely in that a materiall lye or vntruth may be vttered sometymes without sinne or offence, as by the examples before alledged hath beene made euident. But a false equiuocation cannot, for that albeit the chief point, which this fa
                        •
                     se Equiuocator vttered, be thought by him to be truth (as the Arrian before mentioned thinketh his heresy to be Catholi
                           •
                        ke and true doctrine:) yet doth he equiuocate in concealing some circumstance, as not telling his hearer, that it is against the doctrine of that Church, which is commonly called Catholicke, or the like.Differēces betwen a materiall Equiuocation and a materiall lie.
                  
                  57. Another example may be, if a stranger not knowing our differences of Religion in England, should demand a Protestant which he meteth in the street, where he may go to the Catholicke seruice, & he should send him to S. Paules in London, for that he persuadeth himself that to be the true Catholicke seruice; here the Protestant, if he do erre in his iudgment and if that be not the true Catholick seruice indeed, speaketh a falsity, but yet is it but a material falsity, for that he thinketh that he saith truth: but yet further doth he falsly also equiuocate in one thing, which is in not answering to the others true intention, for that he knew that the other meant the Roman Catholicke seruice. And so you see that

materiall false equiuocation, hath somewhat more

                     60. But heere againe may be perhaps obiected, that this material equiuocatiō, if it hath any knowledge or malitious concealement (as heere seem

                      is when the speaker thinketh that which hee saith to be true, as the fornamed Arian doth,Two other obiections answered. though he conceale some circumstance that he ought to vtter, which maketh it vnlawfull though nothing so grieuous as the formall equiuocatiō is, where the Equiuocator knoweth that the whole matter is false, which is sufficiēt distinctiō to make two seuerall members or degrees of false equiuocation in generall, & herby is my diuisiō iustified

And heerby styll it is seene that the good man was much troubled, and out of temper when he wrote these Paragraphes, and so fell to playne scratching in deed: for I disputed neyther of Greeke, Hebrew, nor Latin with him, but only alleadged the common latin text of a verse in the

Prophet Esay (which he had impertinently cyted for his purpose, and posie of his booke) and I said that the Greeke and Hebrew texts were conforme to the said Latin text by me alleaged, & fondly applied by him, which thing I might easely do without ostentation of great skill in Greeke or Hebrew; for so much as the late great Byble set forth in sundry languages hath euery thing translated into the latin tōgue, so as without any great knowledge of Greeke, Hebrew, Chaldy, or Syriake tōgues set there downe a man may by only the Latin tōgue, see what those other te

I cannot well pretermit (for ending this Chapter) one little note more of rare singularity in this man aboue others, which I scarce euer haue obserued in any one of his fellowes, and this is, that the very first wordes of Scripture alleadged by him in the first page for the posy of his Pamphlet, are falsely alleadged, corrupted, & māgled, though they cō
                        tayne but one only verse of Esay the Prophet: and then may you imagine, what liberty he will take to himselfe afterward throughout his whole discourse.
His sentence or Posy is this:The very first text of Scripture alleaged by him

And it is to be noted, that sentences prefixed for posyes ought to be cleare, & not so forced and wrested as this is, which was the cause that I noted it, and M.

               WHAT M. MORTON alleadgeth against the Charitie of P. R. §. VI.
               
                  About Verò and Verè in Carerius.THE tytle of this Paragraph in M. Morton is layd forth in these wordes; An argument of P. R. his kind of charity, attended with a triumphant falshood. And this he saith for that I had reprehended him in my booke of Mitigation for a place cyted out of a treatise of Alexander Carerius Doct. of the Canon law in Padua, which he wrote of late de Potestate Romani Pontificis, wherin after cyting of many other writers, whome he saith to be of his opinion, he addeth the testimony of one Celsus Mancinus, saying: Nuperrim

                      verò Celsus Mancinus in tractatu de Iuribus Principatuum &c. But last of al Celsus Mancinus doth hold the same opinion with vs in his Treatise of the Rights of Principalityes &c. Which wordes M. Morton alleadging and making his aduantage of them, he was noted by me, for two differences from the booke of Carerius printed in Italie, by direction of the Authour himself: first that after the title de potestate Romani Pontificis was added in M. Mortons booke, aduersus impios politicos et nostri temporis haereticos, which addition was not in my copy of Carerius owne booke.
               
                  A slippery shift.72. The second, that he had Nuperrimè verè Celsus Mancinus, in steed of nuperrimè verò, which being contrary to the first edition which I had of Carerius his booke, and seing no reason why I should suspect it to be otherwise in any other later impression, I did lay it to his charge, especially for that I did see him abuse it

                  gregiously to his aduantage (as hath byn said) as though Carerius had ridic

                  The Cullen editiō helpeth nothing Verè for Verò.
                   though M. Morton do alleadge in like māner for his excuse the Authority, or rather errour of his Cullē editiō; yet can he not so easely discharge himselfe therof; for that the very contexture of speach must needes argue to his conscience that it should be verò, and not verè, for that otherwise there should haue byn no apt sense, nor any coniunctiue particle to connect the testimony of Celsus Mancinus to the former. The great letter C. also in the beginning of Celsus (if this be not in like manner altered in M. Mortons edition frō the original) must needs haue

shewed vnto him, that it was no nowne adiectiue, but a proper name of a man, and consequently must be ioyned with verò, and not with verè.
               
               75. And fynally if the thing had byn doubtfull, or might haue byn (as hardly it could to any indifferent or iudicious reader;) yet ought not he, nor could with a good conscience vse the same for an insultation & s

Thus farre his scoffe: which for so much as to me it seemed to stand vpon the voluntarie mistaking of verè for verò (and so it must still, albeit he fell vpon an erroneous print;) I had iust caus

                   to repell the said scorne, as I did with some acrimony of speach, but yet nothing comparable to the excessiue bitternes of M. Morton who condemneth me not only of Malice, but also of madnes for my reprehension, intituling his whole Paragraph, as you haue heard against my lacke of Charity for the same: yea making this questiō in the last lynes therof, How in so manifest impudency, any argument of modestie can appeare? wherby we see the power of anger when it taketh possession of our tongue, what it can doe.

Morton as I did, finding him so different from the Originall booke: so he, though he had lighted vpon an other edition, had no reason (out of iudgmēt & discretion) to vrge so manifest an escape of the print (for so it must be

taken) to the exprobration of two worthy learned authours as Carerius and Mancinus are; and cōsequently that M. Morton (notwithstanding all his d

                  fence) must needes be thought to haue dealt craftely, and to haue equiuocated eyther materially or formally in vrging so much verè for verò, & bringing the same in againe two or three times aft

                        lusiō of M. Morton. 
                     But all Popish Priests vpon this pretended Supremacie and prerogatiue of Pope and people, do vtterly abolish the title of succession in all Protestant Princes: Ergo, And his ergo is to a good purpose, as you may as
                        •
                     ure your selfe. In which heynous slaunder, you may note first, that albeit he name heere only Priests, yet doth he meane it also of all lay-mē, that hold the same doctrine with Priests, & therby strik
                        •
                     th at all their throats at once, so rāke is his malice.
                  79. After this I shewed sundrie sortes of malignāt falsities, to be contayned in this minor proposition of his, That all Priests (without exception) vpon this pretended Supremacie, and prerogatiue of Pope and people, do vtterly abolish all title of succession in all Protestāt Princes. For first I shew that Catholicke doctrine giueth not Supremacie,
                        Mitigat. c. 3. or prerogatiue ouer Princes to the people; but that this is rather the doctrine of the chiefest Protestants of our time, so taught, and so practised by them in all countryes, where they haue dealt against their Superiours, and especially in England and Scotland.
                  
                  80. Secondly I do shew that for so much as no such prerogatiue of people is pretended by our doctrine it cannot truly be said that vpon this pretended prerogatiue all Popish Priestes do abolish &c. No nor vpon the supr
                        •
                     macie or prerogatiue, which we ascribe to the Pope himselfe: for that the right, or not right of Protestant Princes succession to Kingdomes dependeth not of the Popes prerogatiue, but of the Canons of the Church, and temporall Statutes of particuler Realmes and Kingdomes. Thirdly that it is an exaggeration to say as he doth, that all Priestes do vtterly abolish &c. in all Protestant Princes &c. And now you know that exaggerations in capitall accusations are heynous crymes, and shew great lack of conscience

and charity in the accusers.
                  81. And to proue this to be an exaggeration, that all Priestes did vtterly a
                           •
                        olish the tytle of succession in all Protestant Princes, I alleadged contrary examples in all the protestant Princes that euer succeeded in England, since the beginning of the world, who are knowne to be but three in number, King Edward, Queene Eli
                        
                           •
                        abeth, and King Iames, who were admitted both by Priestes and lay-men, ergo all Priestes do not vtterly abolish all succession in all protestant Princes &c. and consequently some moderation must be granted on our side against this odious exaggeration.
                  82 Next after this M. Morton bringeth in no lesse enuious and hatefull a proposition out of Doleman, saying, that Doleman doth pronounce sentence, that whosoeuer shall consent to the succession of a Protestant Prince, is a most grieuous and damnable sinner;Malitious peruerting of the Authors meaning. Dolman part. 1. p. 216. but the booke is examined, Dolemans wordes are found to be these only, that for any man t
                           •
                         giue his helpe, consent, or assistance, towardes the making of a King whom he iudgeth or belieueth to be faultie in Religion &c. is a most grieuous and damnable sinne in him that doth it, o
                           •
                         what side soeuer the truth be, or how good or bad soeuer the partie be that is preferred: which last wordes do shew M. Morton to be a calumniator in suppressing them, and affirming that to be spoken only against the succession of protestant Princes, which is spoken as well against Catholicks as Protestants, and meant more principally of election then successiō, as may appeare by these words, If any man shall giue his helpe to the making of a King &c.
                  
                  83. Here now M. Morton runneth aside from the purpose, and to auoid the necessitie of defending himselfe directly alleadgeth out of M. Reynolds D. Stapleton, and Simancas diuers sentences, wherby they signifie, that in preferring of a Prince, religion ought to haue the first place in consideration, which

he applying to vs, that do condemne Protestant religion will needes inferre therof, that, wee do vtterly abolish all ty
                           •
                        le o
                           •
                         succession in Protestant Princes.
                  
                  84. But doth not the malicious man see, that the same inference may be made of all Professours of other Religions in like manner? As for example: If Protestants were to admit a King in France, and it lay in their handes to preferre eyther a Protestant or a Catholicke, would any man doubt whome they would prefer, or whome they ought to preferre according to the rules of their owne conscience? or will any learned, or honest Protestant, deny eyther that Religion in generall is chiefely to be respected, or that his one religion is not to be preferred before others if it lay in his power? Let vs put the case that a King of England or France hauing diuers Princely Children, and one of them being taken by the Turkes or other infidells as he trauailed vpō the sea, & brought to Cōstātinople, should there be peruerted & made a Turke or Infidell, and that afterwards his parents and brethren dying, the right of succession should iustly fall vpon him, what learned coū
                     sell would M. Morton giue in this case to the common wealth of England or France?A Dilemma to be answered by M. Mo
                           •
                        ton. Will he thinke it lawfull to admitt him, notwithstanding the diuersity of his religion? It may endaunger the whole state of Christianitie round about. Will he say it is lawfull to exclude him? Then will it follow that succession may be resisted for Religion. I expect M. Mortons answere to this Dilemma.

                     6. Wherfore to come to knit vp this reckoning briefly with M. Morton, we see first that he hath not beene able exactly to verify any one of his two former propositions out of his owne syllogisme, concerning Dolemans assertion, but that he hath vsed exaggeration, and calumniation in them both, and that whatsoeuer he hath vrged neuer so bloudily to incyte his Maiestie against vs, may with much more reason & force of argument be retorted against himselfe, and his, as well in England (if the Puritans be his) as in other Countryes against all sortes of Protestants. And when for ending of this Paragraph he frameth a syllogisme inuincible, as he pretendeth, to conclude against vs, saying, One syllogisme will assoyle the whole doubt, he setteth downe such a one, as may wholy be turned vpon himself, changing only the person of whome it is made. The syllogisme is this.
                  
                     
                        Maior
                        Euerie man is a dānable sinner who admitteth any to the Crown  whom he thinketh faultie in Religon.
                        
                           Minor
                        But euery Romish Catholicke thinketh all Protestant Princes faulty in Religion;
                        Ergo
                        Euery Romish Catholicke who admitteth a Protestant to succeed in the Crowne, is a damnable sinner.
                     
                  
                  87. All this syllogisme, I say, is as well veryfied of Protestants as Catholicks, and consequently the force of his argument concludeth nothing at all against vs more then against himselfe and his. For as for the maior proposition,The examination of M. Mortons fond and mali
                           •
                        ious syllogisme. no Protestant of sense I thinke will but grant, that it is a damnable synne to admit any Prince (if it lye in his hand to preferre or hinder) whome he thinketh to be faulty in Religion, for that otherwise we must say that Protestants haue no conscience concerning Religion, if they will aduance wittingly any one that will in their opinion destroy the same. And then I make the minor, But euery true Protestant thinketh Roman Catholikes to be faulty in Religion: Ergo, euery true Protestant that admitteth a Catholicke Prince to succeed in the Crowne, is a damnable synner. And what then shall wee say of the Dolphin of France,

And if there were some such busy seditious spirites among Catholike preachers there, as this of M. Mort. and some others sheweth it selfe to be in England, that would in all their sermons, and bookes raise quarrels, and contentions before hand about this matter, and procure his Christian Maiestie to enter into new doubtes and iealosyes, to propose new Oathes to his Protestant subiectes; and not to belieue them when they haue sworne, but to giue care to such clamorous makebates as these are; should he euer haue quiet? Or his subiectes contentment?

And then he setteth downe my wordes of Charge against him, for abusing the testimony of Frisingensis, which presently we shall recite. But first we must admonish the Reader, that he which in wordes obiecteth heere vnto me so many characters and demonstrations of a lyer, hath not hitherto in fact shewed any one least signe at all of such proceeding but hath beene conuinced of many himse

Now then let vs come to the examination of this Charge, which of vs is to be found in falsity, and still I must aduise the reader that to the end he may receaue some vtility by this cōferēce, he haue an eye to the spirit of false dealing, and not so much to errours of ouersight, and this he shall easily descry, if he stand attent to the discussion.

                  I read and read againe, & fynd that Pope Hildebrand in the yeare 1060. was the first Pope that euer depriued an Emperour of his Regiment, wherin now haue I wronged my conscience? Is it because Otto Frisingensis is cyted cōtrary to his meaning? yet could it not preiudice my conscience, because I cyted not the authour himselfe, but only Tolosanus a Romish Doctour, who reported that sentence of Frisingensis.

                  ndeth all that Chapter instituted by him to improue all Papall authoritie of excōmunicating and deposing Princes. Onely in the margent he setteth downe in latin the wordes of Frisingensis, with citing 
                     •
                  he booke and Chapter, and then addeth, vt resert Tolosanus lib. 26.
               96. Heere then I would aske whether ther were not fraud (supposing Frisingēsis to be alleadged against 
                     •
                  his meaning) to put downe his testimony in the English text without relation or mention of Tolosanus,
                  A double shift. & only in the margent, and in latin to make reference vnto him? Would the currant English reader

euer reflect vpon that, or mistrust that the wordes of Frisingensis were of doubtfull credit, and related only by heare-say? Why had not M. Morton put downe that referēce in his English text which most imported? But the truth is, that it was a double cunning shift, to let it runne in the text as he would haue it belieued by the Reader, as though Frisingēsis had testified against Pope Gregory the 7. and yet in the margent to haue some refuge vnder-hand when he should be pressed with the falshood of the allegation, as now he is.
               97. I let passe as of small moment the erroneous parēthesis which he putteth in of the yeare (1060.) which cānot be true, for that all English men know that VVilliam Conquerour vpon the yeare 1066. entred into Engalnd,

                  r Henry vpō this yeare assigned by M. Morton, for that he was not yet Pope for diuers yeares after, but this I impute to errour, and so insist not vpon it, but rather vpon other pointes of willing deceiptfulnes, which now I am to go forward in noting.
               98. I cannot persuade my selfe but that M. Morton had read Frisingensis himselfe, for it were absurd to write bookes out of other mens notes, as afterwards vpon diuers occasions he doth confesse of himselfe, when otherwise he cannot auoid the obiection of falshood vsed:The words of Frisingensis curtolled. but howsoeuer this were, that eyther M. Morton related the words of Frisingensis, as he found them in himselfe, or in Tolosanus, he hath not faithfully related them, as Tolosanus did: for thus they lye.

question was not to shew what Emperors had byn excommunicated, but who being excommunicated had bene deposed from their regalityes.
Yea (Sir) and will you escape so? why then doth your Authour Frisingensis say that he fyndeth none excommunicated or depryued of his kingdome before Henry the 4. by Gregoy the 7? you see that he includeth both the one & the other, and so doth Tolosanus relate him also, and you haue strooke out the former from Tolosanus his latin text set downe in your margēt because it should not be seene: and then also both the foresaid exceptions of the Emperours Philip and Theodosius he cutteth of & suppresseth, as nothing to the purpose: and yet you know that depositiō
                   of Princes is an effect of excōmunication, and can neuer happen by Ecclesiasticall authority, but where excōmunication hath gone before.A Demaund hardly to be answered by M. Morton. And I would aske M. Morton in good earnest out of his Deuinity, when a Christian Prince is lawfully excommunicated and shut out from all society of Christian communion and he persist impenitent, how can he be head of a Christian cōmon wealth, for so much as he is no member, nor hath any place or part at all in the whole body, the headship being the chiefe part of all others?
               101. Much then it importeth to know the authority and antiquity aswell of excommunication as of deposition: from which cause the examples alledged by Frisingensis ought not to haue bene suppressed or imbezeled: and Tolosanus here alleadged by M. Morton produceth an other example both of excommunication and deposition aboue an hundred yeares before this of Frisingensis,

For hauing shewed (as he perswaded himselfe) that Pope Hildebrād was the first that vsed such proceeding against Emperours, he addeth presētly, that it was a new act, & that it is naught also, will appeare (saith he) by the Actor, for Pope Gregorie the 7.

It remayneth then that for a conclusion we examine his former foure tricks of falshood, which he saith to haue found in one only page of my writing.

And so, for so much as these foure poyntes, which you call trickes, are graue and serious charges truly laid against you, and so substantially proued, as you haue not byn able to auoid any one of them (when now it imported you most for your credit to do it,) I must inferre that all these foure excellent trickes of falshood, that you mention in your margent (which are but consequences of the precedent euictions made against you) do remayne wholy, and soly vnto your selfe. And for tryall I referre the reader to the proofes partly before set downe, and much more to such as are afterward to ensue.

Morton auoucheth) nor yet so absurd, as they who deuised it might be estemed senselesse, but rather craftie and guilefull. And finally in this Paragraph M. Morton professeth to deale against my wit only, and not against my truth, vntill he come to the last of all: so as heere he semeth not to haue discouered anie such grosse transparent falsities of mine

In the second Paragraph he impugneth my memory, and layeth to my charge,Errour in counting obiected. that I erred in numbering the tymes, that the clause of reseruation was expressed both in Latin and English, which I haue answered before. And if it had bene an errour, yet an errour had it bene of memory, or lack of attention,

and not of malice, for that nothing could be gained therby. And albeit M. Morton in the heat of his exaggerations do call it a lye, and a multiplyed lye: yet if it had bene so, it could not be more thē a materiall lye, such a one as might happen by mistaking without any fault of mind, or sinne at all: for so much as the speaker not hauing any interest therby, cannot probably be imagined to haue forg

               112. In the third Paragraph he hath so much to do to defēd his owne syllogisme (which yet he cannot do) as little leysure he had or occasion to obiect falshood against me,3. and 4. & lesse meanes to prooue it. He picked quarrells against my reformation of his syllogisme, as also against the diuisiō of equiuocatiō in the fourth Paragraph, but both were answered, as before you haue heard, without any great charges giuen

               113. In the fifth Paragraph concerning the place of Esay cap. 29. vers. 9. cited for the posy of his booke,5. and 6. all the charge of falshood is against himselfe for alledging that out of Esay,
                  The place of Esay misalleadged. which is not there: and his reply to me is against my skill in Greeke and Hebrew, which I professed not, though little might serue to conuince him in that behalfe. And the same may be sayd of the sixt Paragraph intituled, Against my Charity, for vrging so much the difference of verè and verò,
                  
                     Verè for Verò.
                   out of the text of Alexander Carerius. And albeit that M. Morton in the title of this Paragraph do name a triumphant falshood to be proued against me: yet after when he cōmeth to the proofe, he hath nothing els to say, but that I did

            THE SECOND CHAPTER ANSVVERING TO M. MORTONS SECOND INQVIRY, WHETHER P. R. may be iudged a cōpetent Aduocate in this cause, which he hath assumed: and of some other pointes belonging therunto, especially touching the tytle, and argument of the Booke of Mitigation.
            
                PREFACE.
               
                  WHEREAS M. Morton in th beginning of this his Preamble hath reduced the whole subiect therof to three heades, which he calleth Inquiryes; the first, VVhat sufficiēcy there is in P. R? the second, VVhether he may be thought to be a sufficient Proctor in this case or no? the third, VVhether he hath suffici
                        •
                     ncy to performe his taske? all impertinent and ydle matters as you see. And as

the distribution is very vncleere and confused, euery member treating of sufficiency; so is the prosecution therof much more deforme, for that the first Inquiry hauing had thirty pages allowed vnto it, the second hath but three or foure, and handleth no matter at all of any moment, but only a certaine feigned ridiculous conference, or colloquy deuised by M. Morton to be held vpon a stage by his two aduersaries, the Moderate Answerer, and the Mitigator,

                  tradictory to the assertion of M. Morton, conteyneth so much as was needfull to be said to his negatiue, he saying that it is impossible, and I, that it is not impossible, which albeit, it contayne but a generality, yet doth it suppose all necessary conditions that are to be required,

for performance: As for example, if a noble woman perswaded by some such vnquiet spirit as M. Morton seemeth to be, should resolue to part frō her husband saying, it is impossible for mee and you to liue together, the difference of our natures & conditions being considered, & that her husband should answere againe, it is not impossible; doth he not answere surficiently, and to the purpose? for he vnderstandeth the other circumstances included, if you beare your selfe like a wife, haue respect to both our honours, & the like.A compari

                     on. Vayne then and impertinent is the cauillation of M. Morton, that heere is nothing proued but a possibility: for so much as this possibility was denyed by him before, and is heere againe vpon sundry causes & presumptions, as now we shall see: and consequently my prouing this vnion, and concurrence in temporall obediēce not to be impossible, ouerthroweth directly his whole drift both in his former two bookes, and this other Preamble, wherin he houldeth that it is impossible. Let vs heere his reasons wheron his imaginations are founded.
               
                  His first reason of Impossibility6. His first reason of Impossibility, and that confessed (as he saith) by me, is, for that Catholicke subiectes do belieue, that in some cases there is power left by God in the Church, and head therof the Bishop of Rome, ouer Princes to vse not only spirituall Censures for restraint of exorbitant excesses,
                     Preamb. pag. 36.37. but temporall remedies also, eyther directly or indirectly,
                     Mitigat. prof. pag. 24. when vrgent necessity of the Common-wealth should require, and no other sweeter meanes could preuaile. Wherof M. Morton will needs inferre, that our combynation in ciuill concord and obedience to our temporall Prince, can not stand, no more (sayth he) then Iewes and Iebuzites in one kingdome, Isaac and Ismael in one house, Iacob & Esau in one

                  deth of no more possibility, then Pope, & no Pope, Kings Supremacy, and not Supremacy, which opposites (saith he) can neuer be reconciled togeather. Wherto I answere, that in beliefe and doctryne they cannot be reconciled, but in cyuill life and conuersation, and practice of due temporall obedience they may be no lesse (for any thing touching this point) then if they were

                  ease to set sedition: for that all Catholicke subiects also of other Countryes do hold and acknowledge this doctryne, without any preiudice at all of their fidelity, affection, or dutifull Allegiance towardes their Soueraigne Princes, & liege Lordes, though ther be sundry cases, wherin their said Princes may be ob

His other two next reasons of impossibilitie (for he hath foure in all) are so obscurely and intricately set downe, as if he vnderstand them himself, it is much in my opinon: for as for me, I confesse, I see not what inference can be made out of them, though I haue perused them ouer with much attention more then twice: and the same I suppose, the common Reader will say, when he hath in like manner considered of them. For they concerne onely the excōmunication of Q. Elizabeth, and of King Hē

But I haue shewed now, that more then three times so many Protestant Princes were tolerated by other Popes: how thē do these two examples inferre so generall a necessitie of disobedience in all Catholicke subiects? yea and an impossibilitie of the contrarie, that they can be obedient?

contingent, saying: Doth not nature in beasts, reasō in man, precept of God, teach vs the law of prouidence? euen th

                  esse, that prouidence is a principall part of the high vertue of prudēce surnamed Cardinall, wherby man is likned to God, & surpasseth all other terrene cre

                  tures; yet say I therwithall, that it must go accōpanied with iudgemēt, discretion, and moderation, which are other branches also of the same most excellent vertue of prudence. For if they be wanting, they do make prudēce vnprofitable: yea oftentimes pernicious, turning it into malignant suspitions, mistrustfullnesse, frights, feares, iealosies, & other like effects, which do worke the greatest infelicitie, that in the world can be imagined. And of these pestilent effects,The pestilent effects of flatterers. are efficient causes, for the most part, in Princes, the cunning sycofancy, subtility & malitious informations, suggestions & eggings of flatterers, & makebates about thē, who for their owne gaine & priuate endes, care not what seedes of iealosyes they sow in Princes heades against others, so they may reape fauours thē selues, by seeming to be prouident and ben

going to bed could sleepe nothing at all.
               11. But to returne to our present case, I doe not denie, nor euer did, that due prouidence & prouision ought to be held for

The children of King Henry the first were drowned on the sea; therfore no more Princes children must passe the seas vpon no occasion. Some Kinges of England were pursued by their owne Children, as King Henry the second, and

other sort of subiectes: do not you see how farre this lyeth open to iniurious calumniation and sedition?
               12. But I will giue an example more proper yet to the matter. If a seditious fellow in England that had great authority with the people, and small affection towards the Prince, should continually cry and beat into their heads, that they looke well about them, and stand vpon their guard, for that their King may abuse his Authority and become a Tyrant,The case of a turbulent fellow against his King vnder colour of prouidēce and may oppresse them at his pleasure, when they thinke not of it, alleadging no other probabilities, and arguments of likelihood, but only that he may do it, or that some such thing hath fallen out before, as here M. Morton doth, against the Popes authority and Catholickes that acknowledge the same: and when any one should say to that turbulent fellow, pretending to be so studious of the Common-wealth, and iealous of the Kings proceedings, that he vrgeth only a may be, and that there is no great likelihood of any will be, or that such euents will follow as he threatneth, and draweth into suspition, he should fall into choler, & rage as M. Morton doth, saying: that he cānot laugh for wonder & horror to see any Englishman conceyte so basely of the wittes, and worth of his count

This exclamation I say of this troublesome fellow that would put in iealosie the people and Common-wealth against their King or Monarch only vpon a may be, or possibilitie, were it not iustly to be reprehended? Were not the partie to be cast out as a tumultuous make-bate? But he will say

subiects in this behalfe, which I haue handled more largely in my former treatise tending to Mitigation, and well knowne, and experienced also by his Maiestie in sundry pointes & occasions; only I must say, that M. Morton here hath dealt very partially, in that he taking vpon him to lay before his Maiesties eyes, and those of the State, so many dangers imminent from Catholickes as he pretendeth, both in respect of their doctrine, multitude, auersion of mindes, and other like causes, he leaueth out the other opposite part of the Puritanes, that haue farre worse doctrine without comparison in this behalfe, as I shewed out of their owne bookes, & he should haue yealded, or answered the same (if he had dealt indifferently:) they are more also in number, g

Morton ought to haue seene and noted, if he would haue beene the common watch-man and explorator. But his malice was to the Catholickes, and so vpon them he laieth all: but yet with so silly a discourse as sheweth rather will then skill to hurt them, crying out as you haue heard, & going about to proue that imminent dangers in law of prouidence are not to be neglected, which thesis as it is not denyed by vs, & very poorely proued by him, so for the hipothesis, that such dāgers are imminent by Catholickes to the State, no one argument of moment is alleadged at all.
               
                  
                  The Reckoning of this Paragraph.
                  16. So as, if we will now make vp briefly the Reckoning of this Paragraph, we shall fynd by due accompt, that M. Morton of all those thinges that I wrote in my booke about the matter of Rebelli

                     holickes both in doctrine & practice for diuers Chapters togeather, and shewing the Protestants to exceed them farre, to the worse, in both poynts, he hath thought good to handle no one poynt at all (as reasō would that he should haue done) in this his last Reply, but only in generall that which you heard of certayne impossibil
                           •
                        yes for Catholicke and Protestant subiectes to liue in vnion and common due obedience to his Maiestie: of which impossibilities the fourth & chiefest is,His fifth deuised reason of impossibilitie. that which you haue heard discussed of may be, and the fifth and last is, for that we hould it lawfull to equiuocate, or not to answere directly before an incompetent Iudge, that iniuriously inquireth; and that we hold the lay Magistrates of England incompetēt Iudges to examine Priestes: which may be as good an argument to proue that lay men, and Priests cannot liue togeather in Spayne, Italy, & other Catholicke Countries, for that there also the said lay men are incompetent Iudges in Clergy mens causes, and so are Clergie men themselues if they haue not lawfull iurisdiction, or proceed not lawfully. So as this is the most trifling Impossibility that possibly can be deuised.
                  17. To conclude then,The proper state of the question betwene M. Mort. and me. the Case is thus: M. Morton and I would gladly each one of vs perswade his excellent Maiestie in this poynt of confidence or diffidence towards his Catholicke subiects: I for cō
                     fidence do alleadge, that albeit such due prouidence and circumspection be to be vsed both towards thē
                     
& others, as all dangers may sufficiētly be preuented: yet that so great, and remarkable a multitude of his naturall borne subiects as they are spread and dispersed, not only throughout the bulke and body of the whole people, but also by one veine or other extending it selfe to most of the Nobility and Gentry in like sort, should not for cause of their conscience be put to extremity of despaire; but held at least in some reasonable and moderate tearmes of ciuill equity, though otherwise disfauoured for their Religion. M. Morton seemeth to runne the quite cōtrary course, with his opposite desires and reasons, to haue all diffidence increased, impossibilities vrged, that they cannot liue togeather; despaires confirmed of any tolerable condition whatsoeuer, except they force & change their iudgment and beliefe in religion, with neuer so much repugnance of their conscience; detesteth any mitigation, or moderate interpretation of matters; that all must go by way of extremity.
                  18. And now which of these two courses do rūne to a more sure, soft, and milder end, the prudent Reader will easily conceiue. My considerations are the vnion of harts within the Land
                        •
                     
                     Considerations to benignity. the auoyding of extremities, the strēgth of our Country at home, the honour and estimation abroad, the quietnes of his Maiesties minde, the vniuersall affection of all his people though different in religion, the auoyding of the odious name of persecution, example of foraine Protestant Princes that vse it not, the continuance of high estimation that forraine Catholicke Princes haue had hitherto of the benignity, prudence, and bounty of his Maiesties nature, the preuenting of clamors, writing of bookes, and odious speaches throughout all Courtes, Countryes, Citties, Prouinces, & Realmes that will most certainely ensue vpon the contrary course of violent rigour

and cruelty, engendring euery where hatred, detestation, and malediction abroad, suspitions, execrations, and auersions at home.
                  19. These are my considerations: and whether my aduersary M. Morton haue better for his contrary perswasion I know not: wee shall expect the comming forth of the body of his booke, for this his Preamble is but the head therof, though a great head, being of aboue three score leaues in 4. and of litle wit, as partly hath appeared by that which already hath bene perused, & will do much more by that which is to ensue.
               
            
            
               WHAT M. MORTON answereth about the later part of my Treatise concerning Equiuocation. §. II.
               IN the precedent Paragraph you haue heard what M. Morton had to reply about the first mayne poynt of Rebellion: now commeth he to the second of Equiuocation, writing some 3 petty leaues therof, but with so great an ostentation & vaunt at his first entrance, as if he would do great matters indeed, for thus intitleth he his Paragraph.
                     Preamb. pag. 43. §. 12. 
                  That P.R. hath flatly ouerthrowne his whole defence of mentall Equiuocation, which is made so euident, as that no wit of man can possibly excuse him.
                  A fond vaunting entrance to the impugning of Equiuocation. This, you see, is confidently spoken, and very magnificently of himselfe and his witt, that he hath made thinges so plaine and euident against my Treatise, as no wit of man hath possibility eyther to defend or excuse me. Heere then the Reader will take some examen of witts: for albeit I desire not to render wordes for wordes, yet must I needs foretell,

that he will fynd as great want of wit & discretion in this bragge, and in the medium here chosen to ouerthrow my whole Treatise, as euer, perhaps, he found in any man prefessing wit, and learning.
               21. And yet the good man goeth forward in those his oftentations, stir
                     •
                  ing vp attention to the view of his owne weaknes and folly: for that hauing layd sorth in few wordes my assertion concerning lawfull Equiuocation, to wit, that it is a speach partly vttered in wordes, and partly reserued in mynd, but yet euer true, and no lye, for that the speach agreeth alwayes with the mynd of the speaker, and is true in his sense &c. he beginneth his confutation thus:True Equiuocation. 
                  How now would my Reader heare this noble Equiuocatour con
                        •
                     uted?
                  
                     Ibid. pag. 43. 
                  By Fathers? Or by his owne Doctors? or by sensible reasons? this will be no hard matter to performe, as I hope (God willing) to auouch in due tyme. So he. And this as you see is no otherwise then if a bare and broken debitour hauing byn lōg called vpon to pay his debts, should step forth at length in a vaunt before a multitude saying to his creditor: Come Syr, what sort of gold will you be paid in? will you haue it in Spanish Pistolets? Portugall Cruzadoes? French Crownes? Zechines of Venice? Dallers of Germany, or English Angels? and his creditor should answere him,The case of a bragging banque-rupt debitour. Syr any kynd of coyne would content me, although it were but halfe-faced groates, or single-pence, so I might haue it. And that then the other should reply as M. Morton doth heere: Well, I hope, God willing, to pay you in tyme; and so leaue him with lesse probability of payment then euer before. And were this now substantiall dealing for satisfaction of his creditours? And doth not M. Morton the very like, that asking heere th
                     •
                   reader, whether he will haue Fathers, Doctours, or reasons for proofe against me, produceth neuer a one, but faith, that he hopeth to do

it in tyme? And was it not now fit time to alleadge some one or two at least, if had had such store as he vaunteth, and those of such force and euidency, as no wit of man can controle them? Surely it would haue delighted the Reader to haue read one such exāple in this place for a tast, though he had expected for the other the longer after. But now he must needes suspect the art of Monte-banks in commending their wares so far beyond their worth, and refusing to affoard any sight therof.
               22. But let vs come to see what supply M. Morton deuiseth to make,
                     Ibid pag. 43. in lieu of those former pretermitted proofs of Fathers, Doctors, reasons &c. Heere (saith he) is offered vnto me a briefer course, more fit for a Preāble, and for the triumph of truth more glorious,
                  M. Mort. glorious triumph. 
                  which is to see (as politicke Achitophell hāged in his owne halter, so) this doctor of the art of lying, confounded by his owne assertion. I desire euery child of truth to lend me attention. So he. And all this is by way of preface before he come to his triumphant and glorious victory. And if he do nothing afterward but shame himselfe, and shew his owne folly in mistaking the chiefe point of the question, and not vnderstāding wherin consisteth the principall force of the cōtrouersie, will not all this vaunting prologue proue a halter of Achitophell to hang himselfe?Achitophels halter. 
                  And the styrring vp of euery child of truth to attention, make euery man witnesse of his owne disgrace? Let vs then ioyne issue vpon the matter it selfe.
               23. The means that he taketh here to ouerthrow, as he saith, my whole Treatise of Equiuocation, is the example of the woman Saphyra in the Acts of the Apostles, whome he will needs defend to haue vsed Equiuocation with S. Peter, when she being demanded by him, VVether she sold her land for so much,
                  Act. 5. she answered yea; which being an vnlawfull answere, and punished by the holy Ghost with death, he would

                  t to set downe my whole charge in that behalfe as it standeth in my Treatise, and then shall we see how therby M. Mortō
                   will ouerthrow (as he saith) my whole defence. Thus then I did write in my former booke.
               
                  The Charge giuen by P. R.
                  24. First to begin with his exāples out of Scripture,
I say,

                     e how M. Morton doth ouerthrow my whole Treatise of Equiuocation out of this speach of myne, and that with such euidency, as no wit of man can possibly excuse me. He beginneth his impugnation thus:
The supposed Equiuocation of the woman Saphyra (saith he) was this,
                           Preamb. pag. 44. & 45. I haue sold it but for so much, reseruing in her mynd (for ought that you shall know,) which is agreable to their owne example of Equiuocation I am no Priest (meaning to tell it you.) This later P. R. hath defended throughout his whole booke: and now of the other he is inforced by the word of truth to say, that it is a lye, and that no clause of reseruation could saue it from a lye: from whence it shall inuincibly follow,

                        Act. 5. Wherby it is euident that his and his wiues intention was to lye, and to defraud the cōmunity of a part of their lands, and that they had no cogitation at all of speaking a truth, & auoyding of lying by Equiuocation, as the Priest hath, and so haue all those that meane lawfully, and with a good conscienc
                        •
                     , to couer a truth which they are not bound to vtter, which properly we call equiuocation: so as whosoeuer hath not this intentiō, as it is to be supposed that Ananias & Saphyra had not, he doth not equiuocate, but lye. Which being so, it is very great simplicity, to abstaine frō a worse word, for M. Morton to found his whole discourse vpon this matter, and especially so vaine and vaunting a discourse as this is, only vpon his owne supposall, that the woman Saphyra had intention to equiuocate: which if I deny, as iustly I may, all this glorious building falleth to the groūd. But yet not to cut him of so short, and put him to

a non plus vpon the suddaine, I am content to doe him this pleasure, as to suppose with him, that the poore woman might haue some such reseruation in her mind, as M. Morton imagineth, to wit, that as the Priest saith truly, I am no Priest (with obligation to tell it you:) so shee might meane, that I haue sold it for no more (to acquaint you withall:) and then I say, albeit we should admit this supposall, it is denied by vs flatly, that these two examples are alike, as now I haue declared; the one being vnlawfull the other not. And what inuincible argumēt hath M. Morton, thinke you, now to proue that they are all one? And that of the Priest to be as vnlawfull as the other of the woman? You shall heare.
                  28. If you say (quoth he) that they differ, then must the difference be eyther in respect of the speakers, or of the hearers?
                     The exā
                        ple of Saphyra maketh against him. We answere, that of both; for in the behalfe of the speaker, there was obligation in Saphyra to answere the truth, and in the hearer lawfull authority to demaund it, for that he was lawfull Iudge: but neither of these two things are in the Priest that is vnlawfully examined by the incōpetent Iudge. For that as the said Iudge is no Iudge, & consequently hath no authority to demaund matters preiudiciall to the party examined: so hath the other no obligation to answere directly to his intention or interrogatory. And what hath now M. Morton to reply to these so euident and important differences, that make the one answere lawfull, the other a lye?
                  29. Surely it is a pittifull thing to see how he is puzled in this matter, and would faine say somewhat, and can find nothing wheron he may subsist, or rest himselfe. For first, he beginneth with the person of the woman, that is the speaker, that did vnlawfully equiuocate vnto S. Peter, comparing her to the person of the Priest that lawfully saith vnto

                     M. Mortons first argument discussed, about a competent and incompetent Iudge.
                  31. His first argument is taken from my wordes, where in my treatise of Mitigation I do say thus:
                        Preamb. p. 46. That in mentall reseruation the speach agreeth to the mynd, and meaning of the speaker, for that when I do say to an incompetent Iudge,
                        Mittig. c. 8. num. 54. p. 344. that I am no Priest, I do truly & really meane, that I am no Priest in the sense that I speake it, which may be any that pleaseth me, or that I list to frame to my self. So I. And hitherto M. Morton cyteth my owne wordes, though somewhat brokenly, but yet cutteth of wholy the other that immediatly do ensue and make all playne, to wit, (seeing I haue no obligation to respect any thing what the demander speaketh, or asketh, for so much as he demandeth me against law and equity). Well this is no

playne dealing, as you see. But what argument will M. Morton frame out of these my words? Marke (saith he) The truth of Equiuocation is not suspended vpon the vnderstanding of the hearer, who may conceaue, or misconceaue the speach. so he. But what is this to the purpose? I grant that the truth of any answere made vnto a Iudge dependeth not vpon the vnderstanding, conceipt, or capacity of the said Iudge, but vpon the meaning of the speaker, which meaning notwithstāding is to be measured by the competēcy, or incompetency of the Iudge.How the truth of a speaker may depēd vpon the competency of the Iudg that heareth or demaundeth. For if the Iudge be competent, then is the answerer bound to answere to his intention, and to haue that meaning in his answere which the Iudge hath in his demand: but if he be not competent, then all this obligation ceaseth, and the speaker is free to haue what meaning h

Morton that the difference of competency of Iudges in the cases of the woman and Priest doth make no diuersity in the truth of their answers, and yet will he needes conclude with this consequence (hauing said no more then I haue touched) that for so much as I said in the Treatise of Mitigation, as before you haue heard, that no clause of reseruation could saue the speach of Saphyra from a lye (for that it was to her lawfull Iudge, to whome she was bound to answere directly to his intention) ergo, I do condemn

He saith for that there is no difference in effect between this speach of Saphyra, I haue sold it for no more, to tell it you, & of the Priest, I am no Priest, to tell it you.

                     Truth is truth (saith he) though it be vttered to man or woman, whether to Prince or people, to Symon Peter, or to Symon Magus, yea whether to Archangell or to Sathan, Iudge competent or incompetent, it cannot free a lying speach from the nature of a lye. And the reasō hereof confessed by P. R. is, that the essence and formality of a lye requireth,

                        that the speach disagree from the mind and vnderstanding of the speaker.

                     34. And all this prooueth nothing at all to his purpose.How cō
                        petency or incompetency of the hearer causeth truth or falsity of the speaker. For albeit we graunt that the essence of a lye consisteth principally & immediately in this, that it doth disagree from the mind and vnderstanding of the speaker: yet doth the respect of competency in a Iudge that demandeth, put obligation, as now hath byn sayd, vpon the speaker to haue this or that mind & meaning correspondent to his, that demandeth, which is not in a Iudge incompetent. And albeit these respects of competencie or incompetency may seeme but circumstances:
                        D. Thom. 1.2. q. 18. art. 10. & q. 72. art. 9. yet as in morall matters it often falleth out, circumstances do alter the nature and species of the vertue or vice it selfe, qui

                  35. So heere the selfe same answere, made to a competent or incompetent Iudge is made lawfull or vnlaw

                     ul, true or false, by that circumstāce of his competency, or incompetency, that layeth or not layeth the said obligatiō vpon the speaker, to speake directly to the Iudges meaning. So as when M. Mort. shufleth vp so many things togeather, saying, that truth i
                           •
                         truth, whether it be vttered to man or woman, Prince or people, Symō Peter or Symon Magus, Archangel or Satan, Iudg competēt or incompetent; he either vnderstādeth not the differences that be in these exāples handled togeather,Crafty shufling. or would not haue his Reader to marke the same. For albeit the simple difference of persons themselues to whome we speake altereth not the truth or falsity of our speach: yet some respect or relation in those persons (but especially of being a lawfull or vnlawfull Iudge) may, and doth alter the same wholy, making the one speach truth, and the other falsity.
                  36. And thus much for answering the force of M. Mortons secōd argumēt which in effect is nothing at all. For that albeit all diuersity of persons, to whom

we speake, doth not alter the truth or falsity of the speach: yet some may, when the hearer hath authority to oblige in conscience the speaker to answer directly to his meaning, and to vtter truth, as hath

                     The competency of God, by whō we sweare, maketh euery one competent Iudges and hearers, to

                     his minor, but S. Peter sware by God vnto this maide, the conclusion will follow in good forme: ergo she was a competent Iudge, and consequently also a competent examiner, for that euery competent Iudge hath likewise lawfull authority to examine. So that you see that M. Morton there did not only affirme it, but proue it also by syllogisme,
                        Full satisfact. pag. 86. that she was S. Peters lawfull Iudg: nay he held it for so certaine, that he did set it downe for a proofe of his said maior propositiō thus: The maior (saith he) is true, for that our Sauiour in auouching

truth, held Pilate for a competent Iudg, although he did not i

                     ridicè, but falsely proceed. S. Paul in his cause appealed to Cesars Tribunall seat, who was a Pagan. Iacob did couenant 
                           •
                        ith Laban an idolater. And the mayd to whome S. Peter swore, was cōpetent inough to heare a true oath, if he had bene as readie to sweare truly. In which words you see, that he affirmeth the maid to haue bene competent, by that S. Peter did sweare by God vnto her, and therby pretendeth to proue his maior proposition, that the competency of God, by whome we sweare, maketh euery one cōpetent Iudge, to whome we sweare: And yet within two lines after, he saith againe: but she was no lawfull examiner, and Pilate was a partiall Iudge: so that, denying her to be lawfull examiner, and yet to be competent Iudge, is a plaine contradiction in it selfe.The maides case very troublesome to M. Morton. For that (as hath beene said) whosoeuer is competent Iudge, hath power also thereby to examine: for that otherwise he could not iudge of the truth, wherof he hath no
                        •
                      authority to examine: so as the maides case seemeth very troublesome to M. Morton, no lesse then she was importune to S. Peter. But let vs see the residue of the examples, how they make to M. Mortons purpose, for proofe of his maior.
                  
                  37 The point which they should prooue, is this: that, whosoeuer sweareth to another by God, doth therby make him or her, to whome he sweareth, his lawfull and competent Iudge. The fondnesse of which assertion, though we haue sufficiently layd open before in our Treatise of Mitigation by sundrie reasons and examples;
                        Mitig. cap. 11. nū. 53. pag. 476. yet shall we heere againe take the paines to examine seuerally in a word or two, his other three examples as we haue done now that of the maid. His first is of Pilate: Our Sauiour (saith he) in auouching truth, held Pilate for a competent Iudge. But now what of this? Did our Sauiour make Pilate his competent Iudge, by swearing to him by God? How can he proue it? Or who

would suppose or inferre this but M. Morton? His second example is: S. Paul in his cause appealed to Cesars Tribunall seat. But this is lesse to the purpose then the  former, for that heere was no oath at all of the Apostle, wherby Cesar might be constituted his competent Iudge. His third example is of Iacobs couenāt with Laban, which was an idolater; and is most of  all from the purpose,Three instances examined. and little lesse indeed then ridiculous: for that neither Iacobs couenant with Laban, nor Labans with Iacob (for the couenant was reciprocall) did make either Laban to be competent Iudge to Iacob, nor Iacob to Laban;
                        Gen. 35.22. but both of them remained 
                        •
                     as before, though bound in faith and promise the one to the other for perfourmance of that mutuall frendship, which they had promised, but yet without any superiority of being Iudges the one to the other, as euerie man in common sense doth see: and consequently M. Mortons maior propositiō (that euery man is made our Iudge
                           •
                         to whome we sweare) is not proued to be true by any of these foure instances, nor by thē alltogeather. Let vs passe then to his third.
               
               
                  His third Argument confuted.
                  
                     38. Thirdly, saith he, in mentall Equiuocatiō P. R. saith, that the clause of reseruaton mixed with the outward speach maketh but one proposition which is as true in the mind of the speaker,
                           Preamb. pag. 47. as if it were wholy deliuered in the outward speach. As for exāple: I am no Priest, mixed with this clause cō
                        ceyued in mind, to tell it you; is as true in the Iudgment of P. R. as if it had bene without reseruation fully expressed with the mouth, saying: I am noe Priest to tell it you: Now then, say P. R. (for I meane to fetter you in your owne shackles) the woman when she sayd to S. Peter; I haue sold it but for so much, if she had reserued in her mind this clause, to giue it to

you, either had it bene by vertue of reseruation, 
                           •
                         truth, or els (notwithstanding that reseruation) it had bene a lye. If the clause of reseruation might haue made it a truth, then hath not P. R. said truth in concluding, that no clause of reseruation could saue it from a lie: If contrariewise the tricke of reseruation could not saue it from a lye, then doth not the reserued clause to tell it you, being mixed with the outward speach, I am no Priest, make vp one true proposition, and consequētly it must be concluded of the Preistly Equiuocation, as is heere by P. R. confessed of the womans, vz. that noe clause of reseruation can saue their speach from a lye. For if she had said vnto S. Peter in plaine words: I 
                              •
                           aue sould it but for so much, 
                              ••
                            giue it in common, or such like, this euery one knoweth had beene a true speach: yet she saying, I sould it for s
                              •
                            much, with mentall reseruation, reseruing in her mind, to giue it in cōmon, or to tel it vnto you, was, notwithstanding this reseruation, euen by the iudgement of P. R. a flat lye.
                  
                  39. This is his last and greatest argument, wherof, as presently you shall heare, he vaunteth exceedingly, conquering me first in his margent, writing there: An euident conuiction of P. R. And then againe: A plaine demonstration, to say no thing of the fetters & shackells in the text it selfe.The fetters and shackells that M. Morton vseth. And I haue thought best to lay forth his whole discourse, as it lyeth togeather in his booke, that heereby you may see, with what manner of substance he filleth vp paper, and what sort of shackells he hath to fetter men withall, which are as strong, as the netts of cobwebbes: for that in this place his whole discourse and argument is founded vpon a manifest false ground and principle, to wit vpon the me

And M. Morton doth childishly suppose and affirme, that euery one knoweth that it had bene a true speach. For albeit the wordes of S.

Morton will haue her, her secret meaning must needs be, that she sould it for no more, so as she was bound to vtter it, or giue it vnto him, or bring it to the cōmon purse. All which was false, & a lye, in respect both of

                     er vow to bring the whole to the common purse, and for that S. Peter was her lawful, and competent Iudge, and she obliged

therby to tell him the truth.
                  41. Now then wee see after so many vaunts, and braggs, what M. Morton hath beene able to effect by these his arguments: It shall not be perhaps amisse to add his confident conclusion wherin he doth recapitulate as it were the summe of all, comparing these two answers of the Priest and the woman togeather. Let vs (saith he) for conclusion,
                        Preamb. pag. 48. parallele both these examples which are very neere a kinne.
For if we do compare speaker with speaker, that is, the woman and a Priest, both will be thought to be Votaryes. If outward speach with outward speach, that is, I haue sold it but for so much, and I am no Priest, both are negatiues. If reseruation with reseruatiō, as (to tell it vnto you) or [to giue vnto you] both are mentall. If the forme with forme, both equally ananswerable to the mynd of the speaker. If finally, end with end, both are to deceiue the hearer. Wherfore P. R. granting, that no clause of reseruation could saue her specah from a lye, must by irrepugnable consequence be forced to confesse, that his [I am no Priest] vttered by a Priest, to whomsoeuer it be spoken, notwithstanding any mentall reseruation of [to tell it vnto you] is a Satanicall and damnable lye.
                  
                  42. The wordes of Satanicall and damnable are very frequent with M. Morton, as you see. God send him saluation, and vs all freedome from Sathan, and Sathanicall spirits; which in no one thing are more discryed then by the facility of wilfull lying: but to the matter. His collection in his conclusion is like the making of a latin without the principall Verbe.The principall verb wanting in M. Mortons latin. For wheras he gathereth in the said conclusion, sundry points of likenesse, and neernes of kinne (as he calleth them) to make the speaches of the Priest and the woman to seeme semblable; he pretermitteth of purpose the chiefe and essentiall difference

Peter her lawfull and competent Iudge, whiles she pretended to Equiuocate (if she had any such meaning as you wil needes signe her to haue had) and thereby you will conclude, that all other Equiuocations whatsoeuer, (though to neuer so incompetent a Iudge) must needes in like manner be a lye: which seemeth not only a fancy, but also a very phre

For if we cōsider your precedent arguments, wheron your whole bragging confidence doth rely, no one of them, nor all togeather are worth a rush, to proue any iote of that you pretend, as now largely and manifestly hath beene proued. Wherfore I must needs say that it sauoureth of a strōg humor of vanity in you to frame vnto your selfe so full and glorious a victory as you do, which I assure my selfe will cause more laughter then admiratiō in any discret Reader: and with this alacrity, you may proceed to that which insueth.
                  48. But yet before I end this Chap. I must needs take you once by the sleeue againe,A new lye cōuinced against M. Morton. & tell you, that wheras you do often times serue your selfe in this Reply, of my cōfession, or rather concessiō, that no clause of reseruation could excuse the speach of the woman (Saphyra)

                     from a lye; for that she spake to a competent Iudge, which obliged her not to equiuocate: you to make semblance of some contradiction, and absurdity in me, about the same, doe in the very entrance of this your Reply, (to wit, in your Epistle to P. R.) falsify my words manifestly, affirming me to graunt that, there is a mentall equiuocation (meaning of the speach of Saphyra) which no clause of reseruation can saue from lye; which is a lye indeed, for that this is not my saying, but yours: for that my saying is, that the answer of Saphyra to S. Peter, could not by any reseruation o

                           •
                        or that he was her lawfull Iudg; and consequently, I doe proue, that her said speach was no equiuocatiō at all
                        •
                      and yet are you not ashamed to say, yea and to stand vpon it, and to vrge the matter in sundry places, as graunted by me, that there is a mentall equiuocation which no clause of reseruation can saue from a lye, wheras I doe hold, auerr, & proue the quite contrary, to witt, that such a speach cannot be truly equiuocation, for that it is a lye. This then may increase your alacrity (M. Morton) that this assertion of yours is found to be so plaine, and euidently false, as no equiuocation or mentall reseruation can excuse it from a lye, nor any wit of man possibly defend you therin.
                  49. And this is all in effect that M. Morton hath thought good to handle of the two large subiectes of my former booke,The conclusion of this chapter. touching Rebellion & Equiuocatiō, beginning first with the title (as you haue h

                      yet he alleageth no one proofe in the world, but only the (May be) before mentioned: to wit, that I said, that albeit dangers may fall out, as in al

and dutifull obedience, if they will, and be permitted. And then from this assertion he leapeth presently to another, saying; that my foresaid Treatise of Mitigation, hath betrayed my whole cause both in the one, and the other question, of Rebellion and Equiuocation: for proofe whereof he hath no other argument, as now you haue heard, but only for the former of Rebellion, certayne fond deuised impossibilityes against the said may be. And for the other question of Equiuocation he hath only the case of the poore lying-woman Saphyra, which yet he esteemeth so highly to make for him, as he dareth pronounce, that it ouerthroweth my whole defence of mentall Equiuocation, and that so euidently, as no wit of man can possibly excuse the same. Which vehemēt hyperbolicall asseueratiō of his, I assure my selfe will seeme to the iudicious Reader, that hath takē a view of the triall past, to proceed of so litle wit of man, as it may scarce possibly be defended from plainfolly.
                  50. Well then this being all that is answered to the substance of my booke, we must passe to certaine accidents therof, which are sundry grieuous imputations of false dealing laied to M. Mortons charge, which I did obiter, and as it were by the way, lay opē in my Treatise, thereby to shew the weakenes, and misery of his cause, which forced him (a mā otherwise much louing truth, as himselfe euery where protesteth) to fall into such inexplicable labyrinths of grosse absurdities, as few men before him haue done. And for that these accidents did seeme perhaps to touch him more neerly, then the substance of the controuersy it selfe (for that they are more sensible in the Readers eye and eare:) therfore he hath principally adressed himselfe in this his Preamblatory-reply to euacuate or infringe some of these imputations, but with what successe, the euent it selfe will shew in the ensui

               THE THIRD CHAPTER ANSVVERING TO M. MORTONS THIRD INQVIRY, CONCERNING falsities obiected by him (though falsely) against Catholicke writers, but especially against Card. Bellarmine: wherof no one can be proued.

                         Rebellion & Equiuocation, which being

conteyned but in two small Paragraphes, and treating only two single obiections, do easily shew how little store of substantiall reply M. Morton hath to so large a Treatise as mine was. But we must expect the residue of full complement in his promised larger Reioynder.
                  
                  2. Now in the meane space wee are to examine three or foure other poyntes which he handleth in this his last Preamble-Reply, especially about his owne defence: for that he being deeply charged in my booke for manifold vntrue dealing in his writings which oftentimes was such as could not proceed so much of error, or mistaking, but sauoured of willfull, and witting deceiptfullnes, that commonly is called malice: which poynt for that I noted, and vrged often both against himselfe, and against many other of his profession,Three generall heads to be handled. and this by great number and variety of examples, a

                     tances; he feeling himself touched not a little in credit with this matter, as it may seeme, thought good after due deliberation to take this course of remedying the matter.

And in the  third place, to shape an answere to some of the foresayd  vntruthes, wherwith I had charged him, such as you may imagine he thought himselfe best able somwhat to shaddow or disguise, leaping ouer the rest of most importance, as after you shall perceaue. So as these three points are now to be handled in this, and the next two ensuing Chapters.

but vpon some necessity. The wordes of my former discourse in the book of Mitigation, are these.

                  10. And heere now I must demand of the Reader what he vnderstandeth M. Morton his purpose to be in this place? Is it not to shew that Costerus was lesse modest then I, for so much as I said, if in any one Catholicke writer of controuersies of our age, there might be found but two or three examples of wilfull lying, I would neuer trust him more, but that Costerus went further saying, that no Prince, Prelate,

                         falshood? Is not this M. Mortons plaine meaning (thinke you) as both his words and drift do shew? Yes truly. Which being so, I would aske him first, why he did clippe the latin words of Costerus (being so few as 
                        •
                     hey are) for that he saith, Atqui verò nemo hact

                     11. Why was this paring think you, but that they being s

                        •
                     wrayed his falshood; for that the words (but neuerthelesse) do shew a referēce to somwhat going before, and the words (no Catholicke Prince or Prelate) do demōstrate that Costerus spake not of Catholick or Romā writers, for it had byn ridiculous 
                        •
                     or him in that sense to say, that no Catholicke of the Roman Religion did euer hitherto accuse any Romanists (that is, Roman writers) of falshood, for it had byn most absurd: & therfore if we imagin Costerus to be a man of common sense, we could neuer thinke that he would write so absurdly, and therfore this word (Catholicke) was guilfully left out by M. Mort.
                  
                  12. Well then what was Costerus his meaning? truly himselfe doth set it down both at large, and perspicuously in the very place, and Paragraph by M. Morton cyted, so a as ignorance or error can not be pleaded: for that he treating of the Authority and succession of the Bishops of Rome, and prouing the same out of the ancient Fathers, and historiographers of the primitiue Church,

                     iustly oppressed, and so for this he citeth many examples, euen before the time of Constantine the great, vpon which enumeration he maketh this argument.

                     The argument or inference of Costerus.
                     These godly Bishops of Rome that spent their liues and bloud for the confessiō of Christ, would neuer (of liklihood) haue arrogated to themselues that which was not theirs, nor would they haue vsurped any thing contrary to the will of Christ, except they had well knowne, and byn sure that such an office was left, and commended to them by Christ. And if any man will imagin that they had byn of such impudency, as not to feare to do it: yet would there not haue wanted some others, eyther Bishops, Princes, or Doctors, who by their authority, power, and writings, would haue repressed this attempt of those Roman Bishops. And yet neuerthelesse hitherto there was n

                  14 Thus farre Costerus. And now let vs consider how faithfully M. Morton hath dealt heere, euen thē when he principally pretendeth to deliuer himself
                        •
                      from vnfaithful
                        •
                     es, like as he that being arraigned at the sessions for stealing, doth not abstayne to steale 
                        •
                     uen in that place and presence of the Iudges themselues: who can excuse M. Morton heere? he saw the whole drift of Costerus to be, to shew that if those ancient Popes before Constantine, who were Saints and Martyrs had presumed any thing beyōd their lawfull authority, some Catholicke Prince, Prelate, or writer of that tyme would haue resisted, or reprehended them of false dealing: but no such Prince, Prelat, or writer was found vnto that day, but rather Bishops and chiefe Patriarches did make their refuge vnto thē: therfore it is a signe that they

were held for lawfull Superiours.
                  15. And what now is there heere in Costerus his speach about the lying of Romanists or Roman VVriters? Can there be any defence of this so apparent abuse? will M. Morton say that he saw not Costerus his meaning,M. Mort. conuinced of egregious fraud or that he had not a 
                        •
                     alse meaning himselfe to deceaue his Reader? Why then did he suppresse all the precedent clauses that do declare Costerus his purpose? why did he cut of the other words immediatly following, of Bishops, and Patriarches recourse vnto 
                           •
                        opes, which did properly appertaine and cohere to the said former words and meaning of Costerus, and no way to M. Morton? why did he trāslate (Romanos) Romanists, as though it pertained to Roman writers euen at this day, wheras the whole contex and immediate precedent wordes do manifestly shew that Costerus meant Romanos Pontifices, ancient Roman Bishops in tyme of persecution, and not Roman wryters? And if all these inexcusable fraudes discouered in the allegation of this one litle sentence of Costerus be not sufficient to proue M. Morton not to meane sincerely, nor out of a good conscience (notwithstanding all his protestations to the contrary) I am greatly deceyued: let him produce but one such against vs, & I will say he doth somwhat indeed: & now whether he be able to do it or no, we shall presently take the view, for his list of obiections against our writers doth immediatly follow out of this his fraudulent Preamble, as full stuffed notwithstā

So as for M. Morton to begin his impugnation

with an example, that hath so many disparityes from the case it selfe, and state of the question, sheweth that he hath litle indeed to say against vs to the purpose, notwithstanding his dreadfull threat before set down

                  18. Especially for that vpon want of better matter, as may be presumed, he was content to haue a snatch at Gratian,

                  HIS SEC0ND EXAMPLE of wilfull fraud falsely obiected against sundry moderne Catholicke writers, about the Councell of Eliberis in Spayne. §. III.
                  BEFORE he cōmeth to set downe this instance about the Councell of Eliberis,
                     
                        Premb. p. 53. he falleth agayne to boast and bragge exceedingly, saying:

                        aue you heard this craking?
We may say with Horace,
                     
                        Quid dignum tanto feret hic promissor hiatu?
                     
What strang effect will so great words bring forth? But heere I must agayne,What this bragger is bound to do. and in euery place aduertise the Reader, what this Boaster should and ought to proue, if indeed he can proue any thing at all: to wit, that he lay forth cleerly and perspicuously some two or three plaine instāces out of any one Catholicke writer of our time (as I haue done many against him and his, wherby he and they are conuinced of witting and wilfull falshood,) and this so manifest and apparent, as the Author himselfe must needes know that it was false when he wrote it. Well then, what can M. Morton bring forth in this kynd against our writers, out of this his second example or instance, about the Councell of Eliberis in Spaine?
                  32. In the controuersy about Images (saith he) the Protestants appeale vnto antiquity both of Councells, and Fathers. The first Councell is that of Eliberis about the yeare of Grace 305. which Protestants vrge,
                     
                        Preamb. pag. 53. 
                     as forbidding that there should be any Images in the Church. Now let vs try the spirits of the answerers. Well Syr. And what triall will you make of their spirits heere? The state of your question in controuersy requireth that you should try them for willfull lying spirits, and that they lyed voluntarily, as hath byn proued against you and yours. What haue you to say against them in this kind out of this place? You do accuse them that they haue diuers, & different expositions vpon the said Canon of the Councell of Eliberis? some thinking it to be vnderstood one way, and others another: and for this you alleadg the differēt expositions of Card.

                     ightly vnderstood: as namly those which seeme to deny reconciliation to some persons euen at the houre of death. But howsoeuer this be, certaine it is, that there be sundry Canōs in that Coūcell, which Protestants may not admit, as namly the 13. which saith, Virgines quae se Deo dedicauerunt, si pactum perdiderint virginitatis &c. Virgins that haue dedicated thēselues to God, if they breake their promise of virginity, if

they repent, and that they fell by infirmity of body and do pennance all the time of their lyfe &c. they ought to be admitted to communion in the end. A hard case for Protestant-Nunnes.
                  34. Those other two also, viz. 23. and 26. which are about set fastings vpon Saturday, and other dayes may not be admitted by Protestants, & much lesse the 33. which forbiddeth all Priests, Bishops, Deacons, and Subdeacons to haue the vse of wiues, or generare filios, to beget children, vnder paine, vt ab honore Clericatus exterminētur,

And heere then, how can M. Morton say so confidently as he doth of this Councell of Eliberis, VVe Protestants appeale to the antiquity of Councells, and first to that of Eliberis &c? And do you thinke that he will stand to these Canons now alleadged? If he do, it must needs be very preiudiciall vnto him, and marre his marriage at least, if he haue any intē
                     tion to marry, and yet to lead the life of a Clergyman, according to the prescript of the Councell of Eliberis: as also to be some other punishment vnto his body to be bound to so much fasting, as those Canons of the Councell of Eliberis doe ordaine and prescribe.

                     VVe Protestants (saith he) do vrge this Councell, as forbidding, that there should be any images in the Church. Wherunto he bringeth in D. Payua to answere one way, Bellarmine another, Sanders & Alanus Copus a third, others a fourth, fifth, or sixth (a thing very vsuall among learned men to haue diuers expositiōs euen vpon the Scriptures thēselues,) & then by way

so as it may agree with the truth of the Councells meaning, and with the reason it selfe alledged by the Canon: which variety of answers or expositions in a coniecturall matter, as hath bene sayd, are no wilfull contradictiōs, as M. Morton fondlie supposeth, but multiplicity of expositions. The most generall is, that the true meaning of the Councell was, that for more reuerence of holie images, and to the end the thing which was proposed to be worshipped & adored in them should not suffer indecency, they should not be painted vpon walles of the Church where by the corruption and moysture therof, they might come to be corrupted and defaced, but rather

that they should be made vpon tables, veiles, & such other moueable matter, wherby they might both the better be preserued, and remoued also more conueniently from the iniury of Infidells in tyme of persecutiō: which in effect was the verie same reasō that mooued the ancient and Christian Emperour Theodosius to prohibite,

For yf it had bene otherwise, either he, or some other of that sect after him, would haue cyted the same before the Protestants of our tyme.
                  38. I doe willingly pretermitt the pageants and childish playes, which M. Morton doth make to him self in comparing, and opposing the variety of our writers answers, and interpretations togeather, and the one against the other (as before hath bene said) proposing them as poppetts to make himselfe pastime, which he may do also vpon the grauest Cō

And the fraud cannot seeme but willfull, nor can it any way stand with the intention of Senensis, who saith and affirmeth only (according to the interpretation, which he best alloweth of among manie other) that the meaning of the Councell was this, to forbid the vse of images for a time, least the new conuerted Spanyardes, not being well instructed, seing images vpon the walls, should thinke there were no difference betweene them, and the heathen Idols.

And now let the discreet reader iudge, whether this were his confessed Conclusion, that the Councell of Eliberis did absolutely, or not rather secundum quid, forbid the worship of images. Surely I am ashamed of such shifting in M. Morton, euen then, when he pretē

                      sundry Authors, alleaged by the Magdeburgians, do write, that the said Synode of Frankeford did condemne as well the said doctryne of images, as also the Authority of the Councell of Nice that had allowed the same: which if it were true, yet were not the matter of any great doubt, whether a Prouinciall Councell (such as was that of Frankeford) were rather to be obeyed then a generall, as was the other of Nice. But for that there is great obscurity, and many contradictions in the history it selfe, therfore diuers Catholicke writers do answere, and expound the matter diuersly, alleadging sundry excellent coniecturall reasons, proofes, and probabilityes ech one for themselues, as may be seene in the places of their workes heere quoted, but yet all agreeing in the principall poynt against the Protestants, that the Councell of Frankeford indeed did not cōdemne eyther the Councel of Nice, or the doctryne of Images in the sense (at least) and meaning

that the said Nicene Councell had approued the same. And what is this to the purpose then, to proue that th

                  HIS FOVRTH example of like falshoodes vainely obiected against the same Authors: about the Epistle of S. Epiphanius, touching Images. §. V.
                  FROM these two shaddowes of some scrappes out of two Prouinciall Councels, he leapeth to a place of S. Epiphanius in a certayne Epistle of his, where he writeth of himself,
                        Preamble pag. 59. 
                     That entring into a Church at a place called Anablath to pray, and perceyuing a curtaine wherin was a picture, as if it had byn the Image of Christ or some Saint, he tooke the Curtaine, and rent it, as being a thing contrary to the authority of the Scriptures. This is the story as M. Morton setteth it downe:M. Mortons manner of stickling betwene our Authors. and then presently for answering therof, he putteth all our writers into a great warre among themselues, bringing them in, forth, and backe, this way, and that way, the one opposing, the other answering, the third moderating, the fourth crossing: and himselfe stickling betwene them by interlacing some wordes heere and there, will needs make himselfe the head of the fray.
                  45. And this is so fond a thing as euery Grāmerscholler might do it: for he needeth but to go to Bellarmines works, & especially to Vasquez, who wrote after him of the controuersy of Images, and there shall he fynd all variety of opinions set downe with their Authours and places quoted. And from these hath M. Morton furnished himselfe to make the muster that heere he doth, without any further studdy or labour, then to go to our foresaid Authors, & of

their obiections make affirmatiue assertions, and of their assertions for vs, make objections against vs.
                  46. But heere againe is to be noted as before, that whatsoeuer difference of opinions there be, or may be among Catholicke writers of controuersy, about the true meaning of S. Epiphanius in this place: yet is it nothing at all to M. Mortons purpose, who is bound to proue that they wrote against their owne knowledge, and conscience, which I suppose were hard to do, for that euery man must be presumed to haue written according as his iudgement gaue him, and consequently that all this which M. Morton hath so studiously gathered togeather, is nihil ad rhombum, nothing to the purpose
                        •
                      and therfore I could not but laugh, when I read his conclusiō of this instance saying,
                        Preamb. pag. 61. 
                     That if P. R. shall desyre 
                           •
                        yue hundreth (instances) of this kind, I bynd my selfe (saith he) vnto him by a faithfull protestation, in a moneths warning to satisfy him. Which I beleeue,A fond offer of M. Mort
                           •
                        
                      yea if it were fiue thousand in a weekes warning, for he needeth no more but to go to the foresaid bookes of our Catholicke authors, opening them & laying them before his aduersarie, and they will furnish him at large, when the state of the question is such, as it admitteth variety of opinions, or diuersity of iudgements about any poynt, or circū
                     stance therof.
                  47. As for the controuersy in hand about S. Epiphanius fact and meaning, related in the end of his Epistle to Iohn of Hierusalem, that seemeth to make against Images, though diuers learned men do expound the matter diuersly, some thinking that it was a clause added by some heretikes amongst the Iconoclastes, wherof both Bellarmine, Valentia, Suarez and last of all Baronius do yeald most euident probabilityes, and others that admitting it for the speach of

                     Epiphanius, do very sufficiently answere the same otherwise: yet that in deed it maketh nothing at all against the Catholicke vse of sacred Images, is so euident by conferring their answeres togeather, as nothing can be more.
                  
                      48. As namely first for that Baronius and others do proue abundantly out of Paulinus,
                     
                        Baron. tom. 4. anno. 392. in fine.
                      
                     Venantius Fortunatus, Euodius & other ancient authors, that the vse of images was ordinary & frequent in the tyme of S. Epiphanius: & Suarez confirmeth the same out of old holy Fathers & Doctors of the Greeke Church his equals to wit,
                        Suar. tom. 1. in 3. par. disp. 54. sect. 1. §. ad 3. 
                     S. Chrysostome, S. Basill, S. Gregory Nanianzē, Gregory Nissen & others, wherof is inferred that it is not probable that S. Epiphanius would set downe a thing so cōtrary to the cōmon receaued doctrine, & practice of his tyme, or yf he had, it would haue byn noted & contradicted by some.
                  49 Secondly it is proued out of the second Nicene Councell, that the disciples of S. Epiphanius did set vp his picture publiquely in his Church of Cyprus soone after his death, which they would neuer haue done,  if S. Epiphanius in his life tyme had held it for an abuse,
                        Synod. Nic. 2. act. 6. contrary to the authority of Scriptures to haue the picture of any man set vp in the Church.
                  50. Thirdly S. Iohn Damascenus that liued very  neere 900. yeares gone, testifyeth in his first Oration of Images,
                        Damas
                              •
                           . Orat. 1. de Imagin.
                      that the said Church of S. Epiphanius in Cyprus had continued from that tyme to his imaginibus exornata, adorned with images, and therupon inferreth, that whatsoeuer is found in him sounding against the pious vse of Images is counterfaite & thrust into his workes by the Iconoclast Heretiks. And in the foresaid Councell of Nice it selfe, which was held in his tyme, one Epiphanius a Deacon did shew two other like places to haue bene thurst into his bookes by the same Hereticks.
                  
                     51. Fourthly it appeareth by the sayd Councell, & by S. Iohn Damascen in his forsaid Oration, that this place of S. Epiphanius in his Epistle to Iohn of Hierusalem was neuer obiected against Images, eyther in the Councell it selfe, or by Claudius Taurinensis, or any other Iconoclast at that tyme, which they would not haue omitted to do, if in those dayes such a testimony had byn extant in so graue an author, as was S. Epiphanius.
                  
                  52. Fifthly S. Gregory the Great obiecting to a  certayne Bishop of Massiles,
                     
                        Greg. l. 9. Epist. 9. called Serenus, somewhat the like fact of breaking Images, saith vnto him (as is extant in his owne Epistle:) Dic, Frater, à quo factū Sacerdote aliquando est quod fecisti? Tell me, brother, of what Priest was it euer heard, that he attempted a fact like vnto this of yours? Which he would neuer haue said, if the other might haue answered, I haue heard and read the same done by the great, and holy Archbishop S. Epiphanius.
                  
                  53. Lastly, to omit diuers proofes which our  men do alleage, if S. Epiphanius had held for an errour and abuse against the Authority of Scriptures to haue Images in the Church,A very strong argument, that S. Epiphanius impugned not the doctrine of image
                           •
                        . as our moderne Protestants will needes force it vpon him; then is it likly that he writing so large a worke against all the heresyes, and erroneous doctryne, & perilous abuses that had sprong vp in the Church of God, from Christ vntill his tyme, he would not haue omitted to warne men also of this, that was so dangerous & preiudiciall to the honour and seruice of Almighty God: but no word is to be found of this amongst all his heape of heresyes, and consequently we may for certayne inferre, that he did not thinke this doctryne or practice or setting vp Christian Images in Christiā Churches to be vnlawfull, or against the authority of Scriptures.
                  
                     54. And this for the matter it self

                      which is more then was necessary for me to say, considering that whatsoeuer diuersity of Iudgements there was, or is about the exposition, answere, defence, or impugnation of this place of Epiphanius:New Interludes brought in by M. Morton. yet is there no one iote to be inferred therof that any of them did wittingly or willingly write false against their owne conscience, which is the question in hand, & which we are ready to proue against our aduersaryes. Nor yet do I meane to stand vpon the examen of the Interlude brought in by M. Morton of our Catholicke writers differences of opinions, wherein againe he delighteth him selfe: only I wish the Reader, that wheras Cardinall Bellarmine is heere calūniated about Epiphanius Epistle translated by S. Hierome for denying the last clause therof to be his, he repayre for the solution therof vnto Cardinall Baronius,

                  OF INSTANCES AGAINST CARDINALL Bellarmine in particuler, touching imputation of old heresies. §. VI.
                  
                     IF you haue seene how litle able M. Morton hath byn to performe his promise before, for wilfull falsityes committed by any of our writers hitherto, much more shall you see it now, when leauing the multitude of other Authors, he singleth out Cardinall Bellarmine alone to deale withall: who as he hath written much, so were it not great maruaile, if in so many bookes he should haue left some things, whereupon his aduersaryes might probably wrangle:M. Mortons intē
                        tion by singling out Bellarmine. but as for wilfull vntruth, it is so farre from his knowne, and confessed integrity, as M. Morton could neuer haue made choice of an vnfitter match for that poynt. Nor can it be thought that he chose him vpon hope to find any such aduantage in him in deed, but only to honour himselfe somwhat by contending with such an aduersary,

and to cast some cloudes, at least in the mindes of the simpler sort, vpon the shining beames of Cardinall Bellarmines estimation, by obiecting the name of wilfull falsityes vnto him. But as when the said cloudes are driuen away from the ayre, the force of the sunne is more sensibly felt: so Card. Bellarmines workes being cleared heere from M. Mortōs calumniatiōs, will be more highly esteemed by euery iudicious Reader, as not lending any least true aduā
                     tage vnto any impugnatiō of the aduersarie: & this is al the hurt that he is like to receaue by this assault.
                  
                     
                        
                           Preamb. pag. 62.56. And yet, as if M Morton had some great matters in deed to lay against him, and that the proofes were prompt, certaine, & euidēt, he according to his former excessiue vaine of vaunting, falleth into the s
                           •
                        me againe, writing thus: P. R. requireth an example of any one, who hath byn found so grosly false, that in the eie of man he may not be acquitted either by ignorance of translation &c. which demand if it proceed frō vnfeynednesse,Strange craking and boasting. it seemeth vnto me so intollerably reasonable, that now I am driuen to a two fold trouble in yeelding satisfaction. The one is that I know not with what one to begin first, the falsificators be so many. The second is, when I shall begin with any choice of one, how to make an end, so manifold are their falsificatiōs. Therfore in respect of the falsifyers, I would require of P. R. to propound vnto me any one of his Doctours, in whome he hath best assurance of integrity, whether Greg. de Valentia, Stapleton, Bellarmine, Coccius, Suarez, Turrian, Campian, Gretzer, Feuerdentius, the Rhemish Translation in their annotations, or any (I say) of those which haue beene publikly authorized of their Church, & I will not doubt but to giue him thrice three examples of their fraud. In the meane tyme I thinke it requisite to single out of all, such an one, as is cōmended

of all, to wit, Cardinall Bellarmine, that P. R.

the triall of his successe with this one Antagonist, that he hath chosen out, the Reader may make a ghesse, what he were able to do, if he should enter combat with so many of our writers, as heere he hath named. And for better vnderstanding of the matter, it is to be obserued, that he endeauoureth to condemne Cardinall Bellarmine of wilfull 
                        •
                     alsities in two points.His pretences against Cardinall Bellarmine. First in imputing certaine heresies to Protestants, which (he saith) they do not hould: the second in falsifying other mens testimonies, alledged by him. Both of them were grieuous, if either of them by any one example could be proued in Bellarmine. Now then to the tryall.

Morton hauing perused, and desirous to picke some matter against him, that might seeme to haue some shew of probability, he beginneth with the Pelagians, as you haue heard, which is the fourtenth old condemned heresy, shewed by Bellarmine to be reuiued againe in diuers points by Protestants, thinking best to ouerskip thirteene at on leap. As for example,
                        Bellarm. l. 4. de Eccles. c. 9. §. Pelagiani.
                      wheras the Pelagians did hold two principall heresies among other, saith Bellarmine, the one, That euery sinne though neuer so little is mortall, & depriueth vs of Gods grace: That there is no originall sinne in man, especially in Infants of faithfull parents,
                        Zuing. l. de baptism. Bucer. in c. 3. in Matt. Calu. l. 4. Instit. c. 15. §. 20. he auerreth that the Protestants of our dayes do concurre in both points. In the first all generally, that there is no sinne Veniall of his owne nature: in the second with some distinction, for that Zuinglius (
                        •
                     aith he) denieth Originall sinne in all, Caluin and Bucer in Christian Infants only. This is Cardinall Bellarmines assertion, his latin words be these.
                  62. Zuinglius negat simpliciter peccatum originale in quolibet homine, Bucerus autem & Caluinus solùm in filijs

in any man, but Bucer and Caluin do only deny the same in the children of the faithfull, whome they say to be borne Saints, and to be saued also without baptisme. So as Bellarmine is guilfully abused by M. Morton, in setting downe his opinion, as though he had said that Caluin had denyed with the Pelagians, that there is any originall synne at all in Infants, though lesse in the children of the faithfull, citing his latin wordes in the margent peruersely

proper errours of the Pelagians (which yet are not his words but S. Augustines cited by him for the same) is as ridiculous an inference,
                        Aug. l. 6. contra Iulian. c. 2. & 3. & l. 4. ad Bonif. c. 2. & 4. as if a man should say, it was the proper errour of Arius, and his fellowes in old time to deny the equality of the Sonne of God with his Father, ergo, it cannot be that the moderne Arians of Transiluania, and other places, do hould the same now: and it was the peculier doctrine of Berengarius, and his adherents to deny the Reall Presence, ergo, the Protestants of England at this day cannot be charged with that doctrine. And doth not euery body see the vanity of this inference? Wherfore his conclusion is to be noted, I let passe (saith he) a doze
                           •
                         such criminations, cast by him vpon Protestants, which by the testimonies of his owne Doctors may be proued to haue byn lewd and intollerable slaunders.

But in the meane space I leaue it to the modest Reader, to iudge where the lewdnesse doth remayne, if any be.
                  66. And to this consideration I add another, that wheras Cardinall Bellarmine did charge Caluin, and Caluinists with two principall errors of the Pelagians, the one, that which now hath bene handled, of denying Originall sinne in children, and Infants of the faith

                     The contradiction is this (saith he) to impute vnto Protestants an heresy which taketh away all manner of repentance, and hope o

                         remission of sinne past: & yet to acknowledg in them a contrary orthodoxall truth, which is to professe necessity of repentance, reconciliation, and remission o

                      from acknowledging an orthodoxall truth in Protestants, about repentance, reconciliatiō, & remission of sinns, that albeit they graunt that Protestāts do in words confesse, and prescribe vnto their followers repentance, faith, newnesse of life, and such other points, vttered and practized after their fashion: yet are they little auaylable, and much lesse orthodoxall, but a priuate manner and forme of their owne, reiected and condemned by the Catholick Church, for that it excludeth the Sacrament, and absolution of the Priest, without which after baptisme, either in voto, or, in re (as Deuines do distinguish) in Christian Religion, no pardon, or hope of remission of synnes, can orthodoxally be conceaued. And thus much for this second obiected falsity to Bellarmine.

The Manichees taught, that man after Adams fall had no free will, as both S. Hierome and S. Augustine do testifie in the sentence of M. Morton heere set downe (though craftily he couered their names) and Bellarmine proueth Caluin to hold the same, out of his owne wordes and workes. What answereth M. Morton? Caluin (saith he) is con

                      or not equall to the Father, but only according to the order of beginning or origen, for that the Sonne is originally of the Father: and by this occasion he expoundeth also the first two words of the foresaid sentēce, statu et non gradu, saying, that, per gradum intelligit ordinē personarum: Tertullian by degree in this place vnderstandeth only the order, of the three persons among themselues, but not a different degree in perfection. For that Tertulliā
                      in another place hath these words: Diuinitas gradus non habet, vtpote vnica: the Godhead of the three persons hath no degrees, as being only one.
                  89. Thus then did Cardinall Bellarmine seeke to expound in good sense the first two wordes of the sē
                     tence, by another place of Tertullian himselfe: but the whole sentence he neuer defended, nor admitted, but held it rather for erroneous in Tertullian, & hereticall in Bullinger. And now yow see what notable aduantage M. Morton hath gotten out of this his so notable obiection, which is nothing els, but the discouery of two or three notable shiftes, and fraudulent trickes of his owne. And yet do you consider how he insulteth as if he had proued somwhat against Bellarmine indeed. For thus he continueth his speach for his fifth instance.

And this opinion of Caluin, Bellarmine proueth out of his owne cleare words in sundry places of his workes, as namely lib. 4. Instit. cap. 20. & §. 24. & 25. §. 6. So as in setting downe this assertion of Cardinall Bellarmine, M. Morton hath made him to tax all Protestantes, and to say, they do teach &c. wheras he taxeth only three particuler men. Neyther haue I yet read any other that defendeth the same. Let vs see now how he maketh Bellarmine to contradict himselfe, for herin stands the principall drift of M. Morton, in this place, to seeme thereby to say somewhat against him.
                  92. First then he bringeth in these words as of Bellarmine: It is a cōmon obiection of Protestantes prouing from Scriptures against the doctrine of Purgatory, that the soules of the faithfull presently after death, go directly vnto heauen Out of which words M. Morton inferreth it cannot be, that Protestants should hold the foresaid contrary doctrine of expecting in the porch.
                     Caluin intangled about his atrium or porch.
                      Wherto I answere, that for this, to frame this litle shew of contradictiō 
                     M. Morton hath concealed craftily the name of Caluin in all this obiection, and turned it into Protestants, wheras the assertion is ascribed by Bellarmine namely and chiefly vnto Caluin, and not to other Protestāts: and therfore we graunt that Caluin (supposing his former assertion to be true) cannot vse this obiectiō against Purgatorie, that soules go directly to heauen, except he would say, that his foresaid atrium or porch, and outward place of stay, is also heauen, or a peece of

heauen different from that Sanctuarium Caeli, into which, he saith, that only Christ is admitted vntill the day of Iudgment.
                  93. But other Protestants that hold not this fond opinion (as few or none perhaps do) may vse their former argument still, if it were true, that soules go directly to hell, or to heauen. And it is to be noted how cūningly M. Morton hath borne himselfe in this matter, not once vttering the name of Caluin, but Protestantes in common; wheras Caluin chiefly is meant, yea only perhaps for the Porch:A sly Foxlike tricke about cō
                        cealment. for that it seemeth to haue beene his owne particuler deuise, wherby the sly dealing of M. Morton is discouered in euery thing, and yet (forsooth) will he be still A Minister of simple truth, and conuince Cardinall Bellarmine of wilfull falshood. But let vs go forward, and search further into his simplicitie.

The twentith old heresie (saith Bellarmine) wherin the Protestants of our time do participate with old heretickes, is of them, that denied the Eucharist to be truly the flesh of Christ, & would haue it to be the figure or image of the body of Christ. So it is related in the seauenth Generall Coū

Cyprians opinion, and wrote vnto him against the same: wherwith the good man being somwhat exasperated, wrote a letter vnto Pompeius Bishope of Sabrata in Africk, cited heere by M. Morton, wherin amongst other sharp speaches he hath this interrogation here set downe: Vnde est ista traditio &c? From whence is this tradition (of not rebaptizing heretickes?) Is it deriued from our Lords Authority? &c. vpon which forme of arguing in S. Cyprian, M. Morton saith, that Protestants do lawfully argue in like manner, this or that tradition is not in the Scriptures, ergo, it is not to be admitted.
                  107. But saith Cardinall Bellarmine, this was no good forme of arguing in S. Cyprian,
                     Whether S. Cyprians forme of argument was good, or no. nor euer vsed by him, but in this necessitie for defending his errour as Protestantes also are driuen to vse the same for defence of theirs, and this he proueth by two wayes. First, for that S. Augustine doth of purpose out of the sense of the vniuersall Church of his dayes refute that inference, and forme of argument: and secondly, for that S. Cyprian himselfe in other places where he was not pressed with this necessity, doth yeald, and allow the authority of vnwritten traditions,

which later proofe as the most conuincent, M Morton do

Cyprians tyme diligently discussed, albeit the Catholike Church held a most wholsome custome to correct that in Schismatiks & Heretiks which was euill, & not to iterate that which was giuen them as good: which custome I belieue to haue come downe from the Apostles tradition, as many others which are not found in their writings,S. Augustines learned censure for vnwritten traditions. nor yet in the later Councels of their successours, & neuerthelesse are obserued through the whole vniuersall Church, and are belieued not to haue beene deliuered, and commended vnto vs, but from the sayd Apostles. This most wholsome custome then S. Cyprian sayth that his predecessour Agrippinus did begin to correct, but as the truth it selfe being more diligently after examined did teach, he is thought more truly to haue corrupted thē corrected the same.
Thus S. Augustine of the state of the question, and of the authority of Customes and Traditions vnwritten. Now Let vs see what he saith to S. Cyprians mā

by the Church, is to be belieued to haue taken beginning from the tradition of the Apostles: as there are many things which the Vniuersall Church doth hold, and they are therfore rightly belieued to haue beene ordayned by the Apostles, though they be not found written.
Thus S. Augustine.

Thirdly by cutting of the words immediatly following in Bellarmine, conteyning his second reason, which was that S.

                           •
                        ō, who entreth presently with a shift at the first beginning, saying (as you haue hard) that Bellarmine giueth this prerogatiue to S. Peter: that he was the only Bishop, and that other Apostles tooke their orders from him, wheras Bellarmines saying is, some authors to be of opinion, quòd solus Petrus à Christo Episcopus ordinatus fuerit, caeteri autem à Petro Episcopalem consecration
                           •

                           •
                        k. that only S. Peter was ordeined Bishop immediatly by Christ, and the other receaued their Episcopall consecration from S. Peter. So as in so litle a sentence he leaueth out first, that S. Peter was ordeined Bishop alone by Christ, and then changeth Episcopall consecration into holy Orders,

as though they had not bene made so much as Priests by our Sauiour himselfe, but only by S. Peter, wheras all authors agree that Christ in making them Apostles, made thē all Priests though some do doubt, whether immediatly by himselfe he made them all Bishops. So as no one thing is sincerely handled heere by M. Morton without some nippe or other, as you see.
                  115 Secondly, wheras he saith that Bellarmine laboureth to euince frō the testimonies of Anacletus, Clemens Alexādrinus &c. the proofe of this prerogatiue, he abuseth him egregiously, for that Bellarmine doth alleadg this opinion, that Christ hauing made all his Apostles Priests, did make only S. Peter Bishop,Whether S. Peter were only made Bishop by Christ. with authority to cōsecrate the rest, as the opinion of Turrecremata, alleadging diuers manifest reasons and proofes for the same: as namely one, that either Christ did ordaine none of his Apostles Bishops, or all, or some certaine number, or one only. The first cannot stand, for that if Christ had ordained none,
                        Turrecr. lib desummae. 2. Ecclesia c. 32
                           •
                        
                      then should we haue at this day no Episcopall authority among vs. Nor can it be said that he ordained all immediatly, for that S. Paul was ordained by imposition of handes by the Ministers of the Church, as appeareth Act. 13. and by S. Leo Epist. 81. ad Dioscorum, as also by S. Chrysost. in hunc locum. S. Iames in like manner is recorded, not only by Anacletus Epist. 2. but by Clemens Alexandrinus Eusebius lib. 2. hist. cap. 1. and by S. Hierome de Viris Illustribus in Iacobo, to haue beene made Bishop by S. Peter.
                  
                  116. The third poynt also, that Christ ordayned some certayne nūber, he refuteth, for that it appeareth by the Euangelicall History that all the Apostles were equall, saue only S. Peter, in whom he proueth 25. seuerall priuiledges to haue beene giuen by Christ aboue the rest, wherof this of his being ordayned

All this and much more is in Cusanus in the place cited by M. Morton, which he partly imbezeling, partly corrupting, and playnly falsifying, hath brought forth the broken sentence which heere you may see both in English and latin, far different from the Originalls.

And this is his common tricke neuer lightly to alleadge any one sentence eyther in English, or latin, as it lyeth in the text, but still with some helping of the dye (as his owne phrase is) some crafty cogging must alwayes enter, which I desire the learned Reader to take the paynes but alitle to examine: & if he fynd not this fraud very ordinary, I am contented to leese my credit with him.
                  118. And fynally let him note for cōclusion of this obiection, that all this which M. Morton alleadgeth heere, if it were graunted, as it lyeth, conteyneth nothing, but two different opinions betweene learned men in a disputable question: Whether Christ did immediatly, and by himselfe, consecrate all or some of his Apostles Bishops, or one only with authority to consecrate the rest, Turrecremata and Bellarmine do hold the one for more probable, but Victoria, Cusanus, and some others do allow rather the other: What wilfull falshood is there in this? Or is it not singular folly to call it by that name? But let vs see an other obiection, no wiser then the rest.

                     ted: yet in the places by him cyted, Bellarmine hath no such thing, but only treating of that fire mencioned by the Apostle 1. Cor. 3. Vniuscuius
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         opus quale sit, ignis probabit: Fire shall proue what euery mans worke is, he saith: Aliqui Patrum per ignem non intelligunt ignem Purgatorium, sed ignem diuini Iudicij, per quem satendum est omnes etiam Sanctos, Christo excepto, transire. Some Fathers do not vnderstand by this fire (that must try euery mans workes) the fire of Purgatory, but

the fire of Gods iudgment, through which we must confesse that all Saints also must passe, except Christ himselfe.
                  125. And for this opinion he cyteth S. Hilary and S. Ambrose vpon the Psalme 118. as also S. Hierome,
                     
                        
                           Hilar. in illa verba Psalm. 118. Concupiuit anima mea.

                      who seeme to vnderstand by this prouing-fire mentioned by S. Paul, not the purging-
                           •
                        yre of Purgatorie, which is mētioned presently after in the same place of the Apostle, when he saith, ipse tamen saluus erit, sic tamen quasi per ignem: which later fyre to be vnderstood of Purgatory after death, Bellarmine proueth by the playne exposition of S. Cyprian, S. Ambrose, S. Hierome, S. Augustine, S. Gregorie, and others.
                  126. Now then M. Morton seeing this discourse of Bellarmine would needs pick a quarrel therat, and frame vnto himself some shew of cōtrariety in him, by voluntarie mistaking of the fire of Gods iudgement and triall, due to euery soule immediatly after death, for the fyre of doomes day when the world shall be in a flame, wherof Bellarmine neyther speaketh,
                        Bell. l. 1. de Purg. c. 5. §. Quarta difficultas nor had occasiō to speake: nay he doth expresly deny, and shew, that the prouing-

                        yre of Gods iudgmēts mentioned by S. Paul, is not the fyre of the conflagration of the world: and then doth M. Morton frame to himselfe a contradiction in Bellarmine, as though he had said, that S. Ambrose, and S. Hilarie in the selfe same places of their works, had held for Purgatory, & not for Purgatory, to wit, vpō the Psalme 118. which may be true in different senses, & sentences of theirs, & in different acceptions of the word fyre, as hath beene shewed, for that by the former wordes of S. Paul, Ignis probabit,
                     Three fiers mentioned by S. Paul. fyre shall proue euery mans works, they thinke that Purgatory fire is not vnderstood, but rather the examen of Gods iudgments as hath bene said, through which examining fyre both Saints and not Saints must passe: but by the other fyre that

followeth in the said Apostle, Damnum patietur, ipse tamen saluus erit, sic tamen quasi per ignem, he shall suffer losse or punnishment, but yet he shall be saued as by fire, all the forenamed Fathers do hold that the purging fyre is vnderstood, through which only imperfect men shall passe, so as they vnderstanding of different fires, in the selfe same sentence of S. Paul, no maruayle though they affirme of the one, and deny of the other, without all note of true and reall contradiction: for that a contradiction must be in the self same thing, and in the same respect, otherwise it were a contradiction to say, that Christ was mortall & immortall, passible & impassible, which are not contradictory, but most true in different respects, and other such like speaches: yet let vs see how M. Morton frameth his contradictories heere more in particuler.
                  
                     
                        Bellar. l. 2. de Purgator. cap. 1. §. Adde.127. Among other Fathers (saith he) Bellarmine cyteth S. Ambrose ser. 20. in Psal. 118. for proofe of Purgatorie fire, which he himselfe confesseth in his next booke not to be meant of Purgatory. Marke heere the fraud. A place of S. Ambrose is alleadged by Bellarmine for purgatory out of his Cōmentary vpon the 36. Psalme, after which he sayth:S. Ambrose and Bellarm. deliuered from a cauill of contradiction. 
                     Vide etiam eundem, serm. 20. in Psalm. 118. See also the same S. Ambrose in his 20. Sermon vpon the hundred and eyghtenth Psalme, signifying, that in this place the said Father hath somwhat more, worthy the consideration to the same effect of prouing Purgatory, and then in his second booke, Bellarmine cyting a place out of the forsaid 20. Sermon, where vpon the wordes of Genesis the 4. God placed before paradise a sword of fire, saith: that S. Ambrose affirming that fiery sword to be ignem Purgatorium, by which all must passe, both good and euill, seemeth rather to vnderstand the prouing fire of Gods iudgments to euery soule immediatly after death,

both good and bad, then the payn
                        •
                     ull purging fire that is to ensue after, wherby the bad or faulty do only passe. And what contradiction is there now betweene this reference of the Reader by Bellarm. (for he saith but Vide) to the sermō of S. Ambrose, and this other place cyted out of the same sermon? may not there be in the selfe same sermon different sentences, and different senses vpon different occasions, and to different purposes? Who would wrangle thus but M. Morton for lacke of better matter? If he had shewed Bellarmine to say that the selfe same sentence or discourse of S. Ambrose had beene alleged by him for Purgatory, and against Purgatory, he had performed somewhat: this other picking of quarrels is poore and miserable, and sheweth his wantes in the midst of his braggings: we haue deliuered S. Ambrose from the calumnation of contradiction, let vs passe to S. Hilary.
                  
                  128. So Bellarmine (saith he) dealeth also with S. Hilary,
                     
                        Bellar. l. 1. de Purg. c. 7. vrging his sentence vpon the Psalme 118. as an euident place for Purgatorie, which by his owne iudgment (in his next booke) seemeth not to signify Purgatory, but rather Ignem diuini iudicij,
                     
                        lib. 2. c. 1. by which our B. Lady and Saints must passe, which cannot be vnderstood of true Purgatory. Whereto is answered, that both are conteyned in the discourse of S. Hilary vpon the 118. Psalme, to witt, the prouing fire of Gods iudgment after our deathes, and purging fire of Gods iustice after our iudgment, S. Hylaries wordes are these vpon that Verse of the Psalme, My soule hath desyred thy iudgements:
                     
                        Hilar. in Psal. 118. Meminit Propheta &c. The prophet Dauid hath recounted vnto vs how hard a thing it is to desyre the iudgments of God:S. Hilaries censure of purging fire.
                     for as no man lyuing is cleane in his sight, how may a man desyre that iudgement of his, in which that indefatigable fire is to be vndergone

If then that Virgin that was capable of God, must come into the seuerity of Gods iudgment, who will dare to desyre to be iudg

So farre S. Hilarie.
                  
                  129. In which discourse it is euident, that he comprehendeth both the fire of Gods iudgement, when he saith, that our Lady must vndergoe the seuerity of that iudgement, as also the other purging fire in which he saith so greiuous punishments must be suffered for purging of our soule, which may both well stand together, as acts of the selfe same iustice, to witt, the examination of our lyfe, and punishment of our defects therin found. And how impertinent then is it for M. Morton in these two things to frame a contradiction? but let vs passe to a third.

                  132. And many like sentences may be obserued in the other Fathers speaches, which he expresly alleadgeth to the sense of this of Origen, whom he saith they do imitate and follow in holding, that both S. Peter & S. Paul, and other Saints shall passe also through this fire, though without hurt, Expurgabit Hierusalem (saith S. Basil) Dominus in spiri

God shall purge Hierusalem in the spirit of Iudgment, and the spirit of burning, which is referred to that probation, and examination which shall be made by fire in the world to come. And this I thinke Sixtus Senensis,
                     
                        Basil. in c. 4. Esay.
                      or M. Morton for him will hardly apply from the euidence of the context it selfe, vnto the last cō
                     flagration of this world, which indeed is but a meere coniecture of his, and for such he willeth the Reader to consider of it, as now you haue heard. But M. Morton doth magnifie the same, as somwhat helping him in his opinion to diuert the authorities of these Fathers from inferring the true fire of Purgatory: but the truth is that they may include both, as

before we haue noted, to wit, the fire of Gods iudgment in examining sinnes after their deathes, and the fire of Gods iustice in purging and punishing thē temporally, that were not purged before. Of which later execution of Iustice, and purging sinnes, the last conflagration of the world may be a member or part for those that shall liue vntill the last day of iudgment. Wherunto S. Ambrose in the very place heere alledged seemeth to allude, when he sayth:

When euery one of vs shall come to the Iudgment of God, & to those fires through which we must passe, then let euery man say as the Prophet did, respect my humility, and deliuer me. Where it is euident, that S. Ambrose speaketh of more fires then one. And so this third contradiction of Bellarmine is found to be nothing at all.
                  133. His fourth and last contradiction framed out of B. Fisher against Bellarmine, to wit, that there is very rare mention of Purgatory in the Greeke Fathers, is vnderstood by him as well of the name of Purgatory not then so much in vse, as that the most ancient writers next after the Apostles tyme, when many thinges were not discussed so exactly, (as in processe of time they were) did not so clearely handle that matter: Nemo iam dubitat orthodoxus (saith he) an Purgatorium sit, de quo tamen apud priscos illos nulla, vel quàm rarissima fiebat mentio. No rightly belieuing Christian doth now doubt, whether there be Purgatory or no, of which notwithstanding,

                      there was none, or very rare mention made among those most ancien
                        •
                      Fathers. Wherof he giueth diuers reasons, and indeed the same may be said of sundry important other articles of Catholike Religion: for so much as in the first primitiue Church when the said Fathers were vnder persecution, and occupied in other weighty

affaires against heretickes and persecutors, they had not time, nor occasion to discusse many things, which the holy Ghost afterward did make more cleare vnto the Church by successe of time: and yet doth not Bishop Fisher say, that there was no knowledg of this article of Purgatory in the very first Fathers; but only his meaning was, that the name, nature, & circumstance therof was not so well discussed, & consequently the thing more seldome mentioned by them, then afterward by the subsequent writers.
                  134. Wherfore comming afterward in his 37. article to answere Luther, that sayd, that Purgatory could not be proued by any substantiall argument, he vseth this demonstration against him:The opinion of B. Fisher about the antiquitie of Purgatory. 
                     Cùm à tot Patribus (saith he) tam à Graecis quàm Latinis Purgatorium affirmetur, non est verisimile, quin eius veritas per idoneas probationes illis claruisset. Wheras Purgatory is affirmed by so many Fathers, as well Grecians as Latinists, it is not likly, but that the truth therof was made cleare vnto them by some sufficient proofes. And then after the citing a multitude of Fathers of the one and the other Church, he commeth to proue Purgatory first by Scripture out of both testaments, and then by great variety of testimonies and authories of the said Fathers. And if this will not suffice M. Morton, let him see the threescore before mentioned by me out of Coccius, wherof 30. or therabout were of ancient Greeke Fathers within the first 600. yeares after Christ.

                     MAISTER MORTON hauing plaied his prize as now you haue heard, in charging Cardinall Bellarmine with contradictions, and absurdities about the doctrine of Purgatory, he maketh this conclusion.
If any (saith he) shall but obserue in this one controuersy the number of witnesses brought in for the confirmation of this their new article in the name of ancient Fathers, which are by confessiō of our aduersaries meerely counterfaite,

If further he shall marke how true Fathers, and Scriptures are instanced in for proofe of the same article, wherof (when I speake of Fathers) most of them (whē I speake of Canonicall Scriptures) all of them are found by the iudgment of their owne doctours to be tortured, wrested, and forced, as it were to say that which they neuer meant: if hee, lastly, consider how almost euerie one of thē indeauoring the defence of the same doctrine, is in his owne assertions contradicted by himself, which may be in this one controuersie concerning Purgatorie,

                  138. His third manifest vntruth is, where he saith, that, of Fathers, the most of them, and of Canonicall Scriptures all of them, are found by the iudgment of our owne Doctors to be tortured, wrested, and forced to say (for Purgatory) that which they neuer meant.

I am perswaded that no Protestant, who hath bene conuersant in reading and examining their Authors, but he will stand astonished to heare this grant our Mitigator maketh, as being as I haue sayd) intolerably disaduātagious vnto the Romish part: but he will easily cease to maruaile when he perceyueth by whome it is made, to wit P. R. the Authour of the Booke of Mitigatiō, who himselfe is guilty of thrice three palpable falsityes, so that none shall hereafter need to wonder, why he hath beene so lauish in hazarding other mens credits, seeing he is so desperately prodigall of his owne.
So farre he.
                  143. Wherunto that I may answere briefly, I say, that for my selfe if there may be found thrice three palpable falsities, such as before we haue described, and agreed vpon, to wit, as cannot be excused by any ouersight or errour, but must needes be iudged malicious, and wittingly vntrue, I do not demand any pardon or relaxation from my first offer, that I be neuer credited more, yea if it be but thrice, which is the measure that I offred to others. Hytherto we haue seene no one alleaged & proued: and truly I do confesse, that if I did perswade my self or doubt that M. Morton, or any other could proue any such one vntruth vttered by me, I should be much troubled in conscience therwith: but for that I am sure I neuer had such meaning, I stand very confident that he will neuer be able to bring any one example, and much lesse thrice three, as he braggeth.

                        See before in the preā. p. 50. he would neuer so often and so earnestly mislike the same offer, calling it despe

                  THE SVMME And Reckoning of all this whole Chapter. §. XVIII.
                  NOW then M. Morton to ioyne friendly with you, and to make vp the Reckoning quietly of all this Chapter, wherin you tooke vpon you to proue, that our Catholicke Authours were to be conuinced of manyfold witting vntruthes, 
                        •
                     o vttered by them, as they must needs be presum

                     d to haue knowne that they were vntruthes, whē they wrote them: you see what poore successe you haue had in the enterprize,M. Mort. successe with Popes and other Cath. Authors. in that you haue beene able to proue no one thing of any moment, eyther against Popes, or Popish Authours by you impugned, and much lesse against Cardinall Bellarmine, whome you singled out in particuler: but much hath bene proued against your selfe in that kind, wherof you wrongfully accused him. The three Popes Zozimus, Bonifacius, & Celestinus, haue beene cleared from the slaunder of falsifying the Councell of Nice: and Costerus and Gratian, haue complayned of your wilfull falsifying their words and meaning, and with euident arguments haue iustified their complaint. Your obiections of different  expositions of our Authours concerning the Councells of Eliberis in Spaine and Franckeford in Germany
                     
                        •
                      
                      about the vse of Images, haue byn shewed both to be impertinent to the state of our question to proue wilfull malice,

                     146. And when you come to ioyne with Bellarmine in both the heads by you set downe, first of wilfull falsities,His successe with Bellarmine. and slanders euicted (as you say) by his owne confession, and then of falsifications in the allegation of other mens testimonies, though you stretch your selfe farre, I meane not only your wit, but your conscience also, to charge him with somewhat that may seeme probable against him, for which you haue threescore bookes of his to offer you variety of matter: yet are you so farre of from hauing produced any one thing of substance, whereunto the name or nature of a witting and wilfull vntruth may agree, as you haue wonderfully established the credit of his workes, by these your vaine assaults made against the same, and disgraced your selfe with the note of many witting and wilfull vntruthes, so vttered by you, as they make you in euery indifferent mans iudgment inexcusable; in that obiecting falsely such vntruthes to others, haue so exceedingly multiplied the same your selfe.
                  147. And as for the last matter handled by you heere against Purgatory, and the testimonies produced for the same, I cannot but lay before you a certaine frendly consid

                        Preamb. pag. 70. You haue noted me of indiscretion 
                        
                           •

the disputes of Bellarmine &c. vpon only tre-trip, or triple wilfull falsitie. But you do aduenture a farre greater matter, the eternity of your owne soule, vpon a far worse chance then tre-trip, for that you haue the whole dice of Christian antiquity against you.
                  148. I haue shewed before how that Cardinall Bellarmine hath produced 15. seuerall places out of the old and new Testaments with expositions of anciēt Fathers vpon the same,

Augustine was present) as also of Spayne, of France, of Italy, of Greece, which giue their testimonies to the same effect. I haue shewed also, that he alleageth almost twenty different Fathers of the ancient Church, testifying the same in their dayes. And that Coccius produceth vpon the poynt of threescore within the compasse of the first 600. yeares, that confirme the common faith of the Church in those dayes, to haue held Purgatory, and prayer for the dead for Catholike doctrine, and for the practice also of praying for soules departed, vsed in all ancient formes of Masse, Christian Sacrifices, & Lyturges, throughout all Nations of the Christian world, the same Coccius alledgeth ten seuerall Lyturges,
                        Coccius tom. 2. titul. de Poenitentia art. 5. as that of Hierusalem, that of Rome, that of Alexandria, that of A

                        thiopia, that of Constantinople, Syria, Milan, Arabia, Gothia, and Armenia: all which, or the most of them were in vse in the Churches of those Christian Countryes for aboue 1000. yeares gone, and in ech one is there expresse order prescribed, to pray for the soules departed, which necessarily supposeth Purgatory. He produceth also the large testimonyes of fiue or six & twenty learned Doctors of the Hebrew Iewish Church, some lyuing before Christ, and some after: all which do testify the

conformity betweene Christian doctrine & theirs, in this behalfe.
                  149. And fynally Iohn Caluin himself treating of this matter,
                        Cal. lib. 3. Instit. cap. 5. §. 10. confesseth that the vse of prayer for the dead (which supposeth Purgatorie) was practized in the Primitiue Church aboue thirteene hundred yeares gone. Ante mille & trecentes annos (saith he) vsu receptum fuit, vt precationes fierent pro defunctis: It was receyued into vse aboue a thousand and three hundred yeares past, that prayers should be made for the soules of them, that were departed. Wherunto I do adde, that neuer any Father since that tyme will be found to haue reproued, or written against the same, or to haue accompted it for an errour or heresy, but rather haue condēned the opposite doctrine for impious, and hereticall in Aërius, and other heretikes.
                  150. All which being so, consider I beseech you, euen for the loue of your owne eternall good, vpon what tre-trip or hazard you do cast your soule in, standing so resolutly vpon this deniall, which heere you do.Vpon what mā
                        ner of tre-trip.
                      For if all this Senate of Antiquity, and consent of the Christian world, for so many ages,

                     aue not byn deceaued, you are gone euerlastingly. If they be saued, you must be damned.M. Mort. doth hazard his saluation. If any of them went to the fire of Purgatory, you must needs go to hell-fire. And this is another manner of tre-trip, then to aduenture the credit of Annotations, Bookes, Treatises, and Authors which you name.
                  151. For as if a man being prisoner for a greiuous criminall case of life and death in a strange Country, should find all the ancient lawyers therof from time out of mind to haue byn of vniforme opinion, that except such and such course 
                        •

                      If this case (I say) should fall out in a matter of temporall life or death, I doubt nothing, but the prisoner would stand in feare to follow the yonger lawyers venturous opinions, with so great danger and doubtfullnes of his temporall death and vtter destruction to ensue therby. And yet is M. Morton content in this matter, concerning the euerlasting losse or perill of his soule, to aduenture against all the said Antiquity, yea glorieth therin to make an opposition to them all, for that Caluin & Beza, & some yonger-Deuines haue put him in that gogge. And is not this to play his soule vpon lesse then tre-trip? But now let vs passe to other matters that are to ensue, for that he hauing made this vaine assault against Cardinall Bellarmine, and other Catholick authors before mē
                     tioned, he commeth now to set vpon his aduersary P. R. with all the forces he can gather togeather, though with no better successe indeed, then in the former skirmishes, as by experience you will prooue: wherunto I remit me.
               
            
         
         
            
            THE FOVRTH CHAPTER CONTEYNING CERTAINE IMPVTATIONS OF FALSITIES and falshoods, falsely obiected by M. Morton against his Aduersarie P. R. which are shewed not to be such; but that the obiecter falsifieth also in obiecting them. 
            
               PREFACE.
               
                  BY little and little we draw towards the substance of our chief point of controuersie: which is, whether M. Morton can deliuer himself and his from those imputations of witting and willing

                     alshoods, which in the Treatise of Mitigation we produced against them, and that in so persp

                     ion, to witt, about Rebellion and Equiuocation. Thirdly he obiected falsities against Catholike wryters, both in generall and particuler: and now he continueth to doe the same against me, to the end, as he pretendeth, that hauing weakened somwhat our credits, himself may in the last place either scape Scot-free by our condemnation, or at leastwise say to vs with the good theefe, in eadem estis damnatione: you are in the same condemnation of lying with me. But I doubt this Reckoning will not fall out iust.M. Mort. sleight for escaping. For if we can iustify our selues openly (as hitherto hath bene donne) from any least conuincement of any one malicious and wilfull vntruth, and he not; then will his cō
                  demnation be much more singular and notorious. For that as the Philosopher saith: Contraries layd togeather doe manifest one the other much more: so as he being euidently cōuicted of many witting falsities, as in the sequent Chapters will appeare, and his aduersarie not able to be touched with any one such, as wilbe shewed in this place, the difference betweene them will rest euident, cleare, and manifest, nor can be auoyded by any sleight or tergiuersation. Let vs come therfore to the point it self.
               
                  2. The thing that seemeth most, or one of the most, to haue stong M. Morton in my Treatise, that was directed to Mitigation, was, that out of my detestation of wilfull 
                     •
                  alshood in writing about matters of truth, I sayd in diuers parts: that if any man could bring forth but two or three examples out of any Catholike wryter of our dayes,

                        •
                     ing and willfull manner of lying in such sort, as the fault could not with any reason or conscience be excused, by in

                     ender, negligence, ouer-sight, ignorance, faile of memorie, or the like; but that it must be presumed, that he did lye wittingly & maliciously for the aduantage of his cause, knowing it to be a lye when he wrote or printed it: in this kind I said, that if he could bring me forth but two or three clere examples against my self,
                  My iust offer. 
                  or any other Catholicke authour of ours (as I had donne many in my Treatise against him and his, that in my iudgment cannot be denied to be such) I would neuer wish that authour to write more, or to be trusted afterward.
               
               3. VVith this speach of mine (though not onely indifferent and reasonable, but necessarie also in my opinion) M. Morton seemeth to be much grieued, inueighing against the same in sundrie parts of this his Preface, calling it presumptuous, hypocriticall, prodigall & prodigious, as before you haue heard, saying first in the title of his Paragraph,

                  that he is to lay downe such a discouerie of my notorious falshoods, as will inforce me by vertue of my owne promise, neuer heereafter to credit my self: and then bringing the same in againe in his very first lines of this assault against my self, sayth:
P. R. among others, is bold to insert himself, saying: If any haue set downe in print any such falsitie, so as it must needes be, he knew the truth, and yet would set it forth &c. I will in my conscience greatly discredit that Authour, whether it be another, or my self, if two or three such falsities may be shewed. So the

Mitigator. Whereby it appeareth he would seeme to haue a conscience, and so I doubt not but he hath, but so miserable (if it be lawfull to iudge by probabilitie) as it were a kind of happinesse for him, to haue no conscience at all. Let our Reader witnesse betweene me and him, according to the euidence of testimonies which shalbe brought against him: most of them sh

                     lbe so apparent, that anie one vnderstanding English may presently discerne them.

                     •
                  ar M. Morton, censuring most grieuously, as you see, my conscience, for that I said: That in conscience I would discredit such a lyar, as should be found to ly wittingly. And in reason I do not 
                     •
                  ee with what groundes he hath pronounced this sentence against me, that it were better for me to haue no conscience, then so miserable a one, as I haue. For eyther by a miserable conscience he meaneth an erroneous conscience, or ouerscrupulous, or two large: but either of these must needes be thought to be lesse euill, then no conscience at all. For that euerie one of them may be reformed, terrifyed, stirred vp, or better instructed, which cannot be hoped where no conscience is at all.
               5. Secondly, it may seeme in reason a good conscience that so much detesteth willfull lying as mine doth: and therefore for M. Morton to take an argument from thence that I haue so miserable a conscience, as it were a happinesse to haue none at all, I see not out of what topycall place (though he prof

with such sort of willfull lying, yet made this offer for a vaunt only, which Allmighty God is my witnesse, was, and is far from my cogitation, but that simply, plainely, and in sincere truth without all exaggeration, I so thought, and do at this houre, & shall be most readie to yeeld to the performance of my promise, whensoeuer M. Morton shalbe able to conuince me to the contrarie, as I expected that he would haue donne in this second Replie of his, for so much as he so greatly misliketh the offer, and threatneth so much repentance to me for the same. But you haue seene now that hitherto against other Catholike wryters he hath bene able to effectuate nothing to the purpose: Now shall we examine what he is able to doe against my selfe. Fourteene different charges he frameth against me, but all so idle, light and impertinent, as I doubt me, the Reader will enter into some disdayne afterward to haue lost so much time in perusing them; yet such as they are, you shall haue them set downe in his owne order and methode.
            
            
               HIS FIRST obi
                     •
                  cted falshood against P. R. §. 1.
               HE entreth into this first accusation of me with a Rhetoricall figure,About Thomas Mortons name. saying that he will not vrge me with my owne contradiction, and yet he doth. His words are these: I will not vrge him with his owne contradiction, who in his 
                     p. 28. preface to his Reader in the end thereof saith:
                     Prea. p. 71. To returne to the Treatise of T. M. (for more of his name we cannot yet find out) intituled:

doctrine &c. and yet had he in his epistle dedicatorie vnto both the Vniuersities,
                        Num. 5. & 25. which is set before the preface, mentioned T. M. in his expresse name, Thomas Morton, fiue seuerall tymes: but this fault were very pardonable, were it not in him, who will thinke no fault pardonable in his aduersary. So M. Mort. And then he playeth vpon me further saying: In this cō
                     tradiction I thinke rather, that P. R. his penne did runne before his wit, and so will he excuse himself, except he had rather be accompted lyingly wittie, then witlesse rash &c.
               
               7. And do you see, how M. Morton triumpheth at his first entrance, as though he had conuicted me of some great matter: yet he confesseth that the fault were pardonable in any other, but not in me. So as in it selfe and in his owne nature he granteth it to be pardonable, and thereby also he must needes acknowledge it to be impertinent to our purpose, and to the argument in hand, which is of vnpardonable faults, to wit, of wilfull and malicious lying, wherunto noe pardon may iustly be giuen; for that it is voluntary and not of errour or infirmity: & this if the fault were confessed, or could be proued against me.
               8. But now, what if this be noe fault or contradiction at all in P. R. either pardonable or not pardonable? Yea, and that M. Morton did well know it to be so, & yet would obiect it heere for a cōtradictiō, & that in the first place, & play vpō me for it, as you haue heard, what will you say thē of his consciēce, who holdeth mine for so miserable, as it were a hapinesse for me to haue none? May not euery man then (to vse his owne words) vnderstanding English presētly discerne the same? Let vs come to the proofe.
               9. He affirmeth me to write in the end of my Preface to the Reader, that hauing spoken all that

by way of Preface,
                     Preamb. fol. 71. Mitig. Pref. pag. 28. I would returne to the particuler Treatise of T. M. adding further by a parenthesis (for that more of his name then those two letters I could not yet find out) and yet (saith he) in the Epistle dedicatory to both Vniuersities, that goeth before the said Preface, I called him by the name of Thomas Morton fiue times. But if I shew that the said dedicatory Epistle was written after the Preface, then is there noe contradicton at all: and if M. Morton must needs know it to be so, then hath he either a miserable cause or conscience, or both, that is driuen thus to abuse his Reader for some little shew of matter against me. First then that the Dedicatory Epistle of euery worke is wont to be the last thing that is written or printed, and that by order of nature and good methode it should be so, to the end the Authour should know, what he presenteth and dedicateth,A verie vaine cauill about the vnderstanding of the letters T.M. 
                  M. Morton I thinke can hardly deny: and he that shall read either his Dedicatory Epistle to the King in his first Reply called A 
                        •
                     ull satisfaction, or this to the L. of Salisbury prefixed before his Preamble, will easily see, that they were both written and printed after the Treatises themselues: For that in both Epistles is set downe briefly what is handled in the Treatises themselues: and the like he could not but see and acknowledg in my Dedicatory Epistle, that it was written after the cōmon Preface and Treatise, and consequently that I might know his name distinctly, when I wrote this, and be ignorant therof when I wrot the other.
               10. Secondly I do expressely signifie in the very first lines of my said Epistle Dedicatory to the Booke, that the said Epistle was written after the Treatise and Preface therof. For thus I do beginne my speach to the Schoole Diuines and Lawyers of both Vniuersities:
It was no part of my purpose

(learned Countrymen) when I tooke this Treatise 
                        ••

                        •
                      in hand, either to wade so far therin, as now I haue byn compelled, nor yet to prefix any other Epistle Dedicatory before the same, then the large common Preface it selfe that doth ensue, which may partly appeare by the argument, and namely also and principally by that which we haue set downe in the third Chapter of this Treatise &c.
Which wordes of mine do euidently shew, that my Dedicatory Epistle was written after the comon Preface and Treatise: and therfore well might I come to know M. Mortons name, when I wrote the Epistle, though I knew it not, when I wrote the other, as now hath byn said: and these words also must needes M. Morton haue seene, and so not to haue erred,A plaine conuictiō of witting falshood. if his will had not byn obstinate to errour Wherunto may be added, that if I had written the dedicatory, and printed it with the common Preface, the Printer would haue begunne the numbers of the pages and register of Alphabet with that, and not with the said Preface, as he doth.
               11. But thirdly to conuince him indeed & most apparātly of witting & willing fraud in this point
                     •
                   I must tell the Reader I did in the place heere cyted of the third Chapter of my Treatise, set downe clearely and perspicuously, when, and by what occasion I came to vnderstand, whome the two letters T. M. did signifie, which before I vnderstood not: and the occasion was by the comming forth of the first reply of M. Morton, intituled, A 
                        •
                     ull satisfaction: wherunto he thought best, being pressed to it by his Aduersary, to put his name at length, diuers moneths after I had trauailed in answering his first Inuectiue of Discouery, that had onely the bare two letters for his name, my speach in that place was this:
But yet after diuers

moneths againe, seeing the said Reply to appeare,
                        Mit. c. 3. n. 1. pag. 90. & that the said Minister had now resolued to manifest his name, to wit, of Thomas Morton, which before went cyphered with the two letters onely of T. M. that might as well haue signified Thomas Malmesbury, or Montague, or Montebank, or any such like Syrnames, as Thomas Morton, I was mooued aswell of my selfe as by others exhortation, to resume the thing into my hands againe.
               
               12. So wrote I at that time: and now would I haue the Reader to iudge between vs, as M. Morton also requireth, whether it be likely that he knew that my Dedicatory Epistle, wherin I take notice of his name, were written after the common Preface, and first two Chapters of the Treatise or no: and if he knew it (as needs he must in any mans iudgment, both by the words before alledged out of the beginning of my Epistle Dedicatory, and the same auouched by me againe in the 6. nū
                  ber of the said Epistle,) and yet would obiect that for a witlesse contradiction in me, that hath no more contrariety then to say, for some monethes I knew not whome the two letters T. M. did signifie, but a
                     •
                  terward I did come to know it by M. Mortons owne exposition: let the discreet Reader, I say, iudge what furniture M. Morton is like to haue of substantiall matter to proue wilfull and malicious lyes against me, when he beginneth with this poore and idle obiection, wherin only his owne wilfullnes is conuinced. Let him consider, what reason M. Morton had so to insult ouer me, for contradicting my selfe, and saying: that my p

                     y, then witlesse rash. Are not these ingenious iests? But now, saith he, I come to note such his falles, as may seeme to be recouerable

by noe excuse. Let vs examine them.

                  ore in the first Chapter, and therefore is fondly heere called a fall irrecouerable by any excuse.
                  
                     Preamb. p. 5. §. 3. See sup. c. 1. §. 3. It concerneth only how many times the clause of reseruation is mentioned by him in Latin or in English, which hauing bene alledged by him before to discredit my memory,
                     Preamb. p. 72. as he pretendeth, heere he vrgeth it as a witting falshood. His words are these:
I haue already mentioned (saith he) how peremptorily he affirmed that the clause of reseruation was not by me set downe in latin throughout my whole Treatise against Equiuocation aboue once. Wherto the Reader may answere for me, that it is set downe in latin aboue twenty times: What excuse can he pretēd? Ignorance? Ouersight? Negligence? Why the book was present before his eyes, euen in those places, which he particulerly discussed. Could that errour be by errour of print, diuersity of translation, or difference of editions? (for these are all the pretences which he will allow:) not one of all these (he knoweth) can redeeme him from guilt.
So he.
               14. Whereto I answere, that small guilt can be found (though the errour were graunted) where

no malice or interest can be presumed. For to what end or profit should P. R. erre willingly in a matter that importeth him and his cause so little?
                     See aboue cap. 1. §. 3. Wherfore the most that can in reason be presumed heere, though the obiection were admitted, is, that he erred in memory and nūbring: which is nothing to the argument in hand of wilfull errour. But now you haue seene before in the place here quoted of the first Chapter that in the sense and meaning of P. R. the clause of reseruation was set downe but once in latin, that is to say, intirely, and so as it might not be vnderstood by the vulgar Reader, as M. Morton had promised to do: in which promise also he is shewed to haue fayled, in that telling his Reader that he would alwaies deliuer the same in latin, confesseth notwithstanding, that sundry times he putteth it downe in English: which I am farre of from ascribing to malice, but rather to ouersight or forgetfullnesse, it little importing our cause on either side. But this rather may import much to consider the great pouerty of M. Morton against his Aduersary for sound obiections:The great pouerty of M. Mortons proofes. for so much as he hath brought in this trifle now twice, making a speciall Paragraph therof before, as you haue heard in the first Chapter, and now another heere, the thing it selfe obiected being both false, as hath before byn proued, and vaine, if it were true.
               15. It shall not need to ponder the light and ridiculous insultations of M. Morton, which he vseth commonly, to mak
                     •
                   vp some weight vnto euery pretended charge that he giueth, saying: VVhat excuse can he pretend? Ignorance? Ouersight? Negligence? Could it be errour of print? Diuersities of translation &c? Whereto I answere, that neither of these are need
                     •
                  ull, for that both the thing is iustified in it selfe: and if

it were not, yet maketh it nothing to the purpose: for that no wilfull and witting errour can be probably supposed, where no interest can be gayned therby. And how then is this called a fall recouerable by no excuse? doth he thinke of what he writeth?
            
            
               HIS THIRD obiected falshood against P. R. §. III.
               VVHERAS M. Morton in a certaine Epistle of his to the seduced brethren, calling themselues  Catholikes, prefixed before his Reply of Full Satisfaction, writeth of his Aduersarie, that he was of those doctours,Presumptuous Doctours mentioned by S. Paul. whome the Apostle described, when he saith: They wil be doctours, and yet vnderstand not what they say, nor wherof they a
                        •
                     firme; I taking his meaning to be generall of our Catholike Priests, teachers, and Doctors, as euidently may be gathered by his whole discourse and by the title it self,1. Tim. 2. Epist. Dedic. nu. 23. 
                  Of deceyued brethren, thought best in my Epistle Dedicatorie to the Vniuersities, to answere the same, and to compare somewhat their Doctours with ours, saying among other things:
But whether this description of fond presumptuous Doctours touched by S. Paul do agree rather to Protestant Ministers, or to Catholicke Priests, will appeare in great part by reading ouer this my booke, especially the 5.8. and 10. Chapters, if by Thomas Mortons errours and ignorances, a scantling may be taken of the rest of his Doctours.
               
               17. At which words of mine M. Morton is so grieued, as he wil needs heere frame a speciall accusatiō against me, of a wilfull falshood for applying that to our Priests & Doctors in generall, which he saith

that he meant of his p

                  rsary (the Moderate answerer) but I remit the Reader for triall of this to the ponderation of the text it selfe of his said Epistle to our deceaued Catholi
                        •
                     ke breethren,
                  M. Mort. contemptible opinion of our Catholicke Priests. where within two lines after the words of S Paul recited, he nameth our Priests in generall, comparing t
                     •
                  em with the blind Priests and Doctours of the Iewes. And then againe, for what insufficient Doctours he holdeth our Priests in respect of his Ministers, may appeare by his owne ensuing words, which are these:
But mindes enthralled in the opinion of a neuer-erring-priesthood, could not possibly but erre with their Priests: and such (alas) is the case of all them, whome God in his iustice deliuereth vp to lyes &c.
               
               18. And heere now I would demaund M. Morton in sincerity, did he meane of our Priests and doctours in generall, or noe? doth he thinke that only his Aduersary the moderate Answerer is such a deceaued Priest, as S. Paul pointeth at, or noe? And if prob
                     •
                  bly we cannot presume that his meaning could be only of that one, whome he named, but that vnder his figure he would disgrace and discredit all the rest, so farre as he was able, why might not I speake that which he meant and intended?
               19. But heare, I pray you, how he taketh me vp for this matter insteed of better. VVhat excuse (saith he) may P. R. now vse to free himsel

R. answereth, that this our English edition is sufficient to iustifie him, that you meant to disgrace all Catholicke Priests by the instance and example of one. VVill you say (saith he) that it is an errour of Ignorance, ouersight, negligence? Noe, nor any errour at all, but

a true explanation of your meaning, with a cleare confutation and reiection of the same, and consequently these Rhetoricall shifts are idly brought in by you, nothing n
                     •
                  edfull for me. For P. R. tooke you in your true meaning, wherin you desire to make Catholicke Doctours contemptible in generall for their blindnesse, though to some yow will seeme to graunt the opinion of learning, but yet with such restraint, and limitation, as you make it not better for instruction of Christian soules, then the learning of the Diuell himselfe. For this is your wise and graue conceipt. Let them be as greatly learned (say you) as they are, and would seeme to be: yet must there be a con, I meane an hart zealous of the truth, to be ioyned with science, to make vp a perfect conscience: which is the true Doctour indeed: otherwise we know that the serpent by being the most subtile of all the beasts in the field, will deserue no better commendation
                        •
                     , then to be accōpted the skillfullest seducer.
                  M. Mort. conceipt of Con & science.
                   By which discourse of yours a man may easily see, whether your meaning were generall in your former speach about ignorant Doctours, or no, and how impertinently you bring it in heere for an argument of wilfull falshood against me, for that I vnderstood you in your owne sense. I will not discusse your concept of your science with your con, which was borrowed of Iohn Reynolds, and of others before you: and though I be loath to tell it you, least it may seeme to sauour of reuenge, yet I must say it for your better information, that many men thinke very little of the one or other to be in your selfe, as they should be, either science or good conscience, alleadging your writings for testimony of both.
            
            
               
               HIS FOVRTH obiected falshood against P. R. §. IIII.
               NEXT vnto this he produceth for a falshood in me, that I say in my booke of Mitigation,
                   that he taketh vpon him to iustifie the writings and doings of the Protestants of our dayes,About iustifying of Goodmā. for their seditious doctrines and practizes against Princes, who please them not: and among others M. Goodman in particuler, that wrote the most scandalous booke against the Regiment of women in Q. Maries dayes, and assisted Knox, Buchanan, and others in troubling and turning vpside downe Scotland:
                     Pag. 73. Mitig. p. 100. wheras M. Morton saith, that he condemned him, and consequētly that I dealt iniuriously with him. Thus he citeth my words in a different letter, as though they stood so in my text: He (Thomas Morton) doth particulerly iustifie Goodman.
               
               21. But first you must vnderstand, that it is his common vse, neuer lightly to alleadge truly and sincerely any text, that he will vse to his profit, either in Latin or English, and let the Reader make proo
                     •
                  e of it if in twenty places alleadged by him, he find foure without all alteration, let him say, that I do offer him iniury.
                     Mitig. pag. 99. n. 14. My words talking of the parts of M. Mortons Reply called the Full satis
                        •
                     action, were these:
Secondly he taketh vpon him yet more fondly in the second part of this his Reply to make a publicke iustification of all Protestants for rebelling against their Princes in any countrey whatsoeuer, but more particulerly and especially in England, and therin doth so iustifie

                     Cranmer, Ridley, Syr Thomas VVyatt, and others that conspired against Q. Marie in England: Knox, Buchanan, Goodman, and like Ministers in Scotland, turning vpside downe that State against their Soueraignes; the rebellions raised in Suetia, Polonia, Germany, Switzerland, France, and other countries, as his iustification is a more condemnation of them, and their spirits and doctrine in that behalfe, then if he had said nothing at all, as partly shall afterward appeare by some instances, that we shall alleadge therof.
               
               22. By which words of mine you may see, that I did not single out Goodman alone, as particulerly iustified by M. Morton, as he would make the Reader belieue by his crafty and corrupt manner of citing my words:A fraudulent citation. but that among many others he did go about also (so farre as he durst) to excuse and iustifie him, saying as presently you shall heare, that albeit he approued him not (for this he durst not do, my L. of Canterbury hauing written so terribly against him in his booke of Dangerous positions) yet that the examples alleadged against him by the Moderate Answerer, might excuse him, which were of most intollerable speaches of his against Princes, and heere againe in this his Preamble, that in respect of Romish Priests he might be thought excusable: wherby a man may see his inclination to iustifie him and his writings if with security he might haue donne it. How then is it such a falsity in me to say, that among so many others before named, whom he cannot deny, but that he seeketh to iustifie them, he sought also to excuse and iustifie Goodman, though not in so absolute a manner, as the other Saints of his, yet in some degree conuenient to his estate and merit. Let vs see what I do write afterward more

about this iustification of Goodman: my wordes these.
               
                  23. The moderate Answerer (say I) alleageth first the wordes of Goodman in his booke against Q. Mary,
                     
                        Mitig.

                     ts and Princes transgressing Gods lawes might by the people be punished, condemned, depriued, and put to death, as well as priuate transgressours: and much other such doctrine to this effect, cited out of the said Goodman.
                     
                        Goodman p. 94.119.203. &c. cap. 1. All which the Bishop of Canterbury his second booke of Dangerous positions hath much more largely, both of this Goodman, and many other English Protestants, chiefe Doctours of their primitiue Church, residing at that time in Geneua. And what doth T. M. now reply to this? You shall heare it in his owne wordes:
                        Full satisf. part. 2
                           •
                         
                        pag. 103. 
                     If I should iustify this Goodman, (saith he) though your examples might excuse him, yet my hart shall condemne my selfe. But what do you professe to proue? all Protestants teach positions rebellious? prooue it: heere is one Goodman, who in his publike booke doth mantaine it. I haue noe other meanes to auoid these straites which you obiect by the example of one, to conclude all Protestants in England rebellious, then by the example of all the rest to answere, there is but one. So he.
               
               24. And this is his Full satisfaction and faithfull reply, as he calleth his booke: but how poore satisfaction this giueth, and how many points there be heere of no faith or credit at all, is quickly seene by him, that will examine them.
For first how do the examples alleaged against this Goodman by the moderate answerer excuse him, as heere is said, seeing the wordes he alleageth against him out of his owne

booke are intollerable, and my Lord of Canterbury alleageth farre worse; as for example: that it is most lawfull to kill wicked kings,
                        Dang. Posit. l. 2. c. 1. when they fall to tyrāny, but namely Queenes: and therupon that Q. Mary ought to haue bene put to death as a tyrant, monster, and cruell beast; alleaging for confirmation therof diuers examples out of holy Scripture; as that the subiects did lawfully kill the Queenes Highnesse Athalia: and that the worthy Captaine Iehu killed the Queenes Maiesty Iezabell, and that Elias, though no magistrate, killed the Queenes Highnes chaplains, the Priests of Baal: and that these examples are left for our instruction &c. And now tell me, how may these examples excuse M. Goodman, as our minister Morton auoucheth?
So in my other Treatise.
               25. Whereby you will see that I did no iniurie to M. Morton,
                  
                     See Full satisf. part. 2. nor vsed falshood in saying, that he sought in some sort to iustify also Goodman, as well as the rest, according to the title of his Treatise, which was: A iustification of Protestânts in case of Rebellion, without excepting of any: but he vsed falshood in alleaging my words in the fashion he did, setting them downe in such sort, as might seeme, that I affirmed him to iustify absolutely both Goodman and all other Protestants, especially Cranmer, Ridley, VVyat, and others there mentioned, wheras my wordes are, that he doth so iustify thē as his iustification is a more playne condemnation of them and their spirits and doctrines in that behalf, then if he had said nothing of them at all. Heere then is euident falshood and treachery in alleaging my words and sense, as you see.
               26. And yet as though he had taken me at a great aduantage, he runneth to his accustomed ridiculous interrogations:
                     Mitig. pag. 100. 
                  VVhat excuse now shall P. R. make? shall it be edition? print? translatiō? there is no difference in these kindes. VVas it negligence, or ignorance? the words are playne and all

in English. Thus he playeth with himself and his Reader, and answereth all but that he should, to witt, that it is plaine that he desyred to iustifie Goodman so farre forth, as he might or durst, though his iustification indeed be a more condemnation of thē, as then I sayd, and now must, both repeat and confirme.
            
            
               HIS FIFTH obiected falshood against P. R. §. V.
               THIS obiection is but a peece or parcell cut out of the former to make vp a number: to which end he stretcheth out matters by all meanes possible, to multiply therby his ranke of obiections, vsing the self same thing in sundrie places,About Knox and Buchanā. as before you haue seene in the second obiection, about the reseruation in latin, and after will appeare in manie other points, and heere, and in other insuing obiections he taketh parcells of that, which had beene handled before. For that in the precedent obiection you haue heard how Cranmer, Ridley, Syr Thomas, VVyat, Knox, Buchanan, Goodman, Gylby, VVhittingham, and other Protestant Ministers were accused in matters of rebellion for their writings and practyses against their lawfull Princes, and how slenderlie M. Morton defended the same: you haue also seene and heard how he picked out the person of Goodman, as not defended or iustifyed by him. Now he commeth in with two more, Knox and Buchanan, saying:
                     Preamb. pag. 71. 
                  To the obiected examples of Knox and Buchanan, as Doctou

                     s and Actors of the rebellion in Scotland, my answere was, that their seditious doctrine was condemned in Scotland, noting them

to haue bene worthie of all condemnation: and yet doth P. R. obiect neuer

               28. VVhereto I answere first by the verie words of his defence in the former obiection set downe about Goodman, he seeketh to cleare all other saying:

                     st I answer, there is but one. By which answere it is euident he clereth all the rest: and yf you looke vpō my L. of Canterburies booke of Dangerous positions, you shall finde as bad or worse positions gathered by him out of Knox, and Buchanan, then out of Goodman, though all be most pestilent. Not onely then one Goodman alone is there that holdeth this position according to my L. of Canterburies booke, which authority I perswade my self made M. Morton, togeather with some feare of his Maiesties mislike, to answer so cautelously,Cautelous answering as heere he setteth downe, that their seditious doctrine was condemned in Scotland, saying, that he answered so before in his full Satisfaction. But indeed not fully so, but onely that there was an act of Parlament in Scotland, vpon the yeare 1584. to call in that Cronicle of Buchanan, censuring all such attempts and innouations: which is somewhat lesse, yf you marke, then, that their seditious doctrine was condemned in Scotland.
               
               29. Let vs see then how I impugned this his shift in the booke of Mitigation.
                  
                     Mitig. p. 119. These are my words:

                     For Knox and Buchanan their assertions he answereth vs: you might haue added, that there was in Scotland an act of Parlament to call in that Chronicle of Buchanan, censuring all such attempts and innouations. And then citeth in the margent anno 1584. which was almost thirty yeares after the said doctrine had ben taught, preached &

practized in that Kingdome by those first ghospellers. And is not this a full satisfaction trow you? What if the Chronicle of Buchanan were called in, that recounted with approbation and insolent triumph the attempts made vpon their lawfull Princes by incitation of this doctrine. Doth this take away the doctrine it self? Or doth it prooue that these first ghospellers held it not? What became of the other bookes of Knox? and namely his Chronicle (for he wrote also a Chronicle of the same matters, and of his owne acts therin, as Caesar did his Commentaries) were they abolished heerby? Or doe not the same things remayne in Holinshed, Hooker, Harrison, Thyn, and other wryters, aswell English as Scottish? Or doth all this prooue that this was not their doctrine? See then how full or rather fond this Satisfaction is.
               
               30. Thus I wrote then, shewing that M. Mortons euasion was insufficient, to say, that there was an act of Parlament in Scotland to call in the Chronicle of Buchanan: for heere is nothing spoken of Buchanans other Bookes, nor yet of any bookes of Knox: nor do I find that M. Morton did vse these words of cōdemning them then, which now he doth: that their seditious doctrine was condemned in Scotland. Nay, as I noted before, by saying that onely one Goodman had held positions seditious, he thought to iustify and cleare both these two, & all other their companions from iust reprehension. Whereby you see, how idle an obiection against me this is of wilfull falshood, for that I said he endeauoured to defend generally all Protestants from seditious doctrine and practise: which indeed he doth throughout all his second part of his sayd full satisfaction.

Morton make a great matter about this, as though it had bene done of set malice, by a nimble sleight, as he calleth it, therby to make it seeme, that he did put a contradiction in Bellarmine against himself, as accusing Caluins speach for hereticall in one place, and yet graunting it to be Catholicall in another: wheras M. Morton sayd, he meant to put an opposition onely betweene Campian & Bellarmine, the one

                  ccusing Caluins speach as hereticall, the other allowing it, as Catholicall.
               33. But all this is a meere trifling cauill. For first, what could it import me or my cause wittingly to haue changed these two names of Campian and Bellarmine, for so much as it was all one to me, for M. Morton to prooue that Bellarmine was contrarie to Campian, Genebrard, Lindan, and Canisius in this matter, as to himself? And therefore for me to change voluntarily these names, Cui bono? what interest could I haue by it? And so much of the n

                  mes.
               
                  34. But now for the thing it self, albeit Bellarmine in the place heere quoted do shew, that according

to the exposition of Iosias Symlerus a Caluinist, the words of Iohn Caluin in a certaine sense may haue a true meaning, yet simply and absolutely doth he cō
                     demne the same, as hereticall, saying: Caluinum existimo,

                     quoad modum loquendi, sine dubio errasse. I doe thinke without doubt, that Caluin did erre in his manner of speach. And a little after he beginneth a new Treatise against him with this Preface: Restat, vt modum loquendi Caluini &c. It remaineth that we do demonstrate Caluins manner of speach,Caluins manner of speach condemned by Be

Pugnat secundò cum Concilijs, and secondly it is repugnant to the manner of speach of ancient Councells, as the Nicene and others: pugnat tertiò cum doctrin

                      is contrary to the doctrine of the old Fathers: fourthly, it agreeth with the speach of the old Arians, and other such proofes, which Bellarmine doth prosecute at large confirming each one of these members by diuers examples and instances, & that Caluin spake heretically in fauour of the Ariās in this behalf.
               
               39. Thus farre of Bellarmines opinion, and thus much I did set downe in the booke of Mitigation vpō this place: whereby it appeareth that Bellarmine neither is contrary to himself, neither to Father Campian and other Catholike wryters before mentioned: for that all of them do agree, that the manner of Caluins speach is hereticall, dangerous, and to be auoyded, though in some streyned sense it may passe. But I

did shew besides this in my forsayd Answere, that M. Morton in reciting Bellarmines Latin wordes in his margent, did wittingly and wilfully corrupt the same for his aduantage, by turning illum into illos, and hoc errore into errore onely, cutting of the word, hoc, which made or marred all the market about clearing of Caluin: for that Bellarmin said only (talking o
                     •
                   the heresy of the Autotheans,) Non facile audeo pronunciare illum in hoc errore fuisse.
                  A nimble sleight of M. Mort. I do not easily presume to pronounce him (Caluin) to haue bene in this errour, refuted by Genebrard of the Autotheans; M. Morton citeth him thus: Non facilè audeo pronunciare illos in errore fuisse. I do not easily presume to pronounce thē (Caluin and Beza) to haue bene in errour, that is to say, in any errour at all: wherein Bellarmine should be contrary to himself, hauing said of him a little before, sine dubio errasse, without doubt he erred in this manner of speach: & so you see, that this h
                     •
                  ynous fault, which heere M. Morton obiecteth vnto me, that I by a nimble sleight would make him seeme to produce Bellarmine as contrary to himself, is donne by him, without any sleight of mine, but only by a sleight of his owne, in voluntary corrupting of Bellarmines text: so as going about to accuse me iniustly, he falleth himself iustly into the trap, and yet he runneth finally to his former accustomed interrogations.

               HIS SEAVENTH obiected falshood against P. R. §. VII.
               THIS obiection he beginneth in these words: P. R. in his Treatise of Mitigation cap. 4. nu. 14.  rangeth at large, saying, that Thomas Morton framed a second part of his booke (Of full Satisfaction) for iustification of Protestants:The iustif
                        •
                     ing of Protestāts from Rebellion. and yet in effect he confessed all that his aduersary opposed (about seditious doctrine, and practise of mutinyes and rebellion:) let P. R. learne what this meaneth,
                     Preamb. p. 75. & 76. 
                  littera occidit, & then let him come to be tryed by my 
                     •
                  ooke &c. Thus far he. But in my opinion it had bene good, that M. Morton had expounded vnto vs himself, what his littera occidens, or killing letter doth meane, that we might haue learned the mistery at his owne hād. For as in the Apostles speach that vsed the same phrase,2. Cor. 3. we know his mind to haue bene, that the only literall vnderstanding of the law of Moyses doth kill without the quickning spirit of the internall meaning, so how M. Mort. can apply it to his Booke or my Answere, I know not, or in what sense either of them may be called such Kill-cowes.
               37. But let vs come to the point it self in controuersy. I do say indeed in the place by him quoted of my Treatise, that wheras his first aduersary the Moderate Answerer had alleaged great store of proofes against him, out of Protestant writers themselues, to conuince both their doctrine & practice in matter of seditiō, far to surpasse that of the Catholicks, and that M. Mortō
                   in his Booke of Full Satisfaction made a shew as though he would answer the same, one by

one: yet that his answere was such, as cleared nothing the case,
                     Mitig. p. 113. but in effect con

                  ssed all, wherof I gaue this second ensuyng reason as is to be seene in my Treatise of Mitigation.
               
               
                  38. And indeed (quoth I) what other Answere can be framed to most plaine assertions out of their owne wordes and writings, as of Caluin, Beza, Hottoman, and so many other French Caluinists, as I haue mentioned in the first Chapter of this Treatise? Goodman also, Gilby, VVhittingham, Knox, Buchanan, and others neerer home vnto vs? All the forenamed collections in like manner of him that is Archbishop of Canterbury, of D. Sutcliffe and others in the bookes intituled Dangerous positions, Suruey of the pretended disciplinary Doctrine, and the like: wherein their positions are most cleeerly set downe concerning this matter. And albeit this Minister T. M. in his reply doth vse all the art possible to disemble the same, by telling a peece of his Aduersaries allegations in one place, and another peece in another, altering all order both of Chapters, matter and methode set downe by the Answerer, so as neuer Hare when she would sit, did vse more turnings and windings for couering her selfe (which the Reader may obserue euen by the places themselues quoted by him out of his aduersaries booke:) yet are his answers such, where he doth answere (for to sundry chiefe points he saith nothing at all) as do easily shew that in substance he con

                     esseth all, and cannot deny what is obiected. And where he seeketh to deny any thing, there he intangleth himselfe more, then if flatly he confessed the same. Some few examples I shall alleage, wherby coniecture may be made of the rest.
               
               39. So farre then. And in proofe and prosecution

of this matter I do spend there a dozen leaues at least,Nothing can in truth be answered for excusing Protestans in matters of Rebellion. refuting all the Answers & shiftes, that he vseth to yeld some, not full but faint & feeble satisfactiō, to the testimonies alleadged, wherunto for breuities sake I remit the Reader, not to make here an vnnecessary repetition.

And this last hath byn of all Protestants, and out of all which he frameth seuerall falshods against his Aduersary P. R. as dishes of different dressing, only to make a shew and o

               HIS EIGHT obiected falshood against P. R. §. VIII.
               THIS obiection consisteth principally in a certaine  vehemency of passion, wherunto M. Morton suffered himself to fall (as often otherwise he doth) for that he was reprehended for a certayn dissimulation of his, when knowing & hauing seene that his aduersary had set downe before many grieuous accusations not only against the doctrine, but also the seditious practises of the Protestant Geneuian Ministers Farellus, Caluin, Beza, Hottoman &c.
                  About dissembling the wicked practises of Caluin Beza and others. against the B. of Geneua their rightfull Lord, both spirituall

and temporall, the King of France and others, yet was he not ashamed to make this conclusion. Thus is Caluin iustified (saith he) concerning his Doctrine, and in him also Beza. VVe haue heard of their opinion, haue you any thing to except against their practise? Wherof I did inferre as the words did import, that he would haue men thinke, that there was nothing to be obiected nor excepted against their practise. Now he saith that, that question was not made by him in way of flat deniall, as though his aduersary could not charge Caluin and Beza with any practise of Rebellion, but after the manner of Rhetoricall art and common speach by way o

               41. Thus he saith, & would escape by this: and I am so equall & easy to be intreated in this matter, or rather so indulgent, as I am content to accept of his owne interpretation, protesting sincerely notwithstanding, that I vnderstood him in the other meaning when I wrote by Booke, the words themselues leading me therunto. But how soeuer it be, there can be no least matter of wilfull malice framed hence against me,
                     Preamb. p. 49. notwithstanding that M. Morton crieth out: O impotency of malice! it is not vnlike vnto the blindnes of the Sodomits, who after that they had seene Lotts house,
                  M. Mort. falleth into great imapatiēce. 
                  yet groped for the dore. Which comparison I graunt that I vnderstand not, no more then before I did his Littera occidens: for that the men of Sodoma that came to Lottes house saw the same when they had their eyesight, and would haue broke open the dore, but being stricken blind by the Angells, they could not see the dore: what great point of mistery is this to grope at the dore when they were blind?
                     Ibid. Mitig. p. 132. Or wherin may this be like to my cause? P. R. (saith he) a litle after discusseth

                      practise, & yet now will not acknowledge the beginning. So he. And let the iudicious Reader iudge, how aptly this is applied: yet to the thing it selfe I say, that true it is, that he indeauoureth both before and after to answere to diuers proofes of seditious practises obiected by his aduersary against Caluin and Beza, but weakly, Godwot, as may be seene by my Reply, and yet out of his owne confidence, or that courage rather which before I mentioned of a Cocke of the game,
                     Vbi supra.
                   he would make that crowing vaunt, Thus is Caluin iustified (saith he) concerning his doctrine, and in him also Beza: you haue heard their opinions, haue you any thing to except against their practises? Would not you thinke that he meant that we had none at all to obiect, no more against their practises then their doctrine? And that as he held the one for iustified, so did he hould the other for iustifiable, and that herin there was no exception to be made? Wherin then standeth this wilfull malice of mine? Yea this intollerable impudency or impotency of malice, to vse his owne words? But for that they were spoken in impatience, I will not greatly vrge the same, nor yet seeke to recompence them, least I should go against the title of this Treatise, which is A quiet and sober Reckoning; the moderate iudicious Reader shall be the iudge of all, where passion, and where modesty is found.
            
            
               
               HIS NINTH obiected falshood against P. R. §. IX.
               HIS ninth obiection is a strange one, and  signifieth that the poore man is exhausted and cannot well tell what to obiect, with any shew or probability in matter of wilfull falshood; so as he falleth to lay hands of things quite against himselfe. For wheras I had proued in my Treatise Of Mitigation two or three manifest vntruthes, vttered volū

                  dle these points againe, and in part to excuse himself, by the feeble meanes, which presently you shall heare: concluding nothing more against me, but this, which are the last words of all his discourse. VVherefore (saith he) these two lies which P. R. would haue bestowed vpon me, he by vertue of his place and Patent may keep to himself.
                  
                     Pream. p. 79. & 80. And is not this a great inference, when he should conuince me of wilfull falsity? But you shall heare vpon what grounds he obiecteth these two vntruthes to me, for that I conuinced him of foure.

                        ox a more anciēt and authenticall Historiographer then he, doth plainely set downe, that together with the pretence of the marriage the cause of Religion was also pretended,
                        Fox Acts and Monum. an. 1554. p. 1289. nu. 30. in these words: The mention of marriage with Spaine (quoth he) was very ill taken of the people, and of many of the Nobility, who for this, and for Religion, conspiring among thēselues made a Rebellion wherof Syr Thomas VViat knight was one of the cheifest: And againe. They sayd, that the Q. & the Coūsell would by forraine marriage bring vpō this Relme miserable seruitude, and establish Popish Religion.
                  
So Fox. And it cannot be presumed, but that M. Morton had seene, and read this, yet durst affirme, that there was no mention of Religion at all in VViats pretence: which is the first lye.
               
                   45. The second also, that in the Oration of Q. Mary against VViat there was not found any scruple concerning the cause of Religion, is proued likewise false by the same authority of M. Fox in his Acts and Monuments: who

                     Sander. l. 2. de Schis. p. 322. for that Q. Marie being a zealous Catholick Princesse would haue them rather called in question for heresie, which is treason against God, then for conspiracie or commotion, which is treason against her person:

                  e time by the apprehensiō of a certaine gentleman (whome he nameth to haue byn cast into the Fleet for another matter) there can be no doubt I say, but the chief Protestants, to wit, Bishops and Ministers had as deeply their harts, & hands, & heads in this, as in the former of the Duke of Northumberlād, & much more: & so did Q. Marie vnderstand it, as D. Sanders declareth, though she proceeded rather against them in matters of Religion for the causes now rehearsed: so as in this third point also M. Morton is conuinced of falsitie, yea of falshood in like māner, as may appeare both by that we haue related, and for that in this his last Reply he hath wholie left this matter out, and past it ouer with silence.
               
                  
                     Fox ibid. Holinshed anno 1553. p. 1096.48. And finally the fourth point is also most false, that there was nothing meant by that rebellion against the State, or the Queene, but rather for them both, and that her Highnesse preheminencie and soueraigntie might not be impaired, which Iohn Fox also contradicteth: and not only he, but Holinshed in like maner M. Mortons owne deare Author: for that both of them ioyntly relating Q. Maries Oration, doe

affirme VViats answere to haue bene vnto two of the Counsell, sent to him by the Queene, to know the cause, to wit, Syr Edward Hastings and Syr Thomas Cornwallys (which VViat confessed also at his arraignement) that he and his would not be contented, except they had the gouernement of the said Queenes person, the keeping of the Tower, and the placing of her Counsailours, which was in effect to take the Royalty of her Crowne from her: I will rather be trusted, then trust, sayd he, and therfore demaund the custodie of the Tower, and her Grace within it, and the displacing o

                      some Counsailours about her, and to haue others placed in their roomes. So writeth Holinshed of Syr Tho. VViats words to Syr Edward Hastings. And y
                     •
                  t sayth M. Morton, that it is plaine, that VViats commotion was not against the Q. or State, but rather for both: and to the end, that her Highnesse preheminencie, and soueraignty might not be impaired. And can any man forbeare to laugh, or rather not conceaue indignity at the vttering of such palpable vntruthes; yea knowne vntruthes to the wryter, when he wrote them? For it is vnpossible but that M. Morton insisting so much vpon Holinshed as he doth, should haue seene and read him in this place, and yet is not ashamed, as you see, to cō
                  tradict him, and face out the matter, as though all were smooth and verifiable, which he vttereth, & shamelessely affirmeth, to wit,
                     Full Satisf. par. 2. p. 120. 
                  that there was nothing attempted by VVyat against Q. Maries person, when he demanded her to be his prisoner, and to dispose of her forces, State and Counsell.
               49. These foure voluntary falsities then were layd vpon M. Morton and proued,Notorious lying. as you haue heard in my last Treatise, will it not be well to examine now, how he hath bene able to discharge himself thereof in this his last Preambling Reply? Let vs heare then, if you please, his owne defence in these foure lyes obiected.
               
                  
                  50. The first lye (sayth he) which P. R. noteth against me,
                        Preamb p. 80. is in relating of the Oratiō of Q. Marie, wherein I said, there was no scruple concerning Religion, and I cited for witnesse Holinshed. This author (as we may perceyue) P. R. hath examined, and could find nothing in him against me for this point touching Q. Maries oration, therefore he seeketh other euidence, and bringeth against me the testimony of M. Fox, wherin there is mention of Religion. VVhat therfore? Therefore I am by him condemned for a lyer. Nay. But rather by this opposing M. Fox, P. R. hath wilily imitated the fraud of a

                     t from home. So likewyse P. R. if he would haue prooued me a lyer should haue donne it out of Holinsheds relation of Q. Maries Oration, which was the witnesse, whome I produced: but he wanting cause of reproofe heerin, doth therefore range further to cōuince me of lying, by the testimony, which I mentioned not.
               
               51. Do you see, what a kind of proofe he bringeth? that for so much as Holinshed either omitted, or guilefully concealed the mention of Religion in the Proclamation of VViat, and oration of Q. Marie, therfore I might not prooue the same out of Iohn Fox, that was before, and nearer to the matter then Holinshed, who taketh out of him? doth not one affirmatiue witnesse constantly auouching any thing, prooue more then ten that hold their peace, & say nothing? Or is Iohn Fox become of so little credit now with M. Mor

as that of Holinshed, especially when he affirmeth, & the other saith nothing?
               52. But yet further, if you remember two points or wilfull falshood were obiected out of M. Morton, and prooued out of Fox, which heere are shufled vp into one: and the third, that no Minister of the ghospell was brought in question about this Commotion, is wholy omitted heere by him, without any mention therof at all,
                     Preamb. p. 81. and much lesse, without any answere. And as for the fourth (which he calleth the second) that there was nothing meant against the Q. or State,
                  M. Mort. conuinced of intolerable falsities. he hath a strange defence therof saying, that euen in that purpose of VViat to keep the Tower, wanted not the supposed intention which was the preseruation of the Q. and State, which (say I) must needes be vnderstood also of the violent keeping of her person, holding of the Tower and forces therof, and appointing her Counsaylors. And these be the good intentions and meanings that M. Morton defendeth in the rebellions of his Protestants, holding them notwithstanding for very good subiects, though by armes they forced them to these conditions. And the successe and issue may be seene by the practise of the Hollanders in the low Countries, and of Duke Charles of Suetia, and others, who began their taking of armes in the names of their true Kings & Soueraignes, pretending & protesting that all was for the safety & good of their State and persons: and no lesse in the cause of Syr Thomas VVyat.
               
               53. Heere then you see, that he is conuinced of foure seuerall false assertions, which he could not choose but know to be false, before he set them downe, if he read, and belieued M. Fox, and other Protestant writers. But how now (thinke you) doth all this conuince, or so much as accuse me of any willfull falsitie? And if it doth not, as euery

And do I then heere play Legier-de-main cōueying rings into other mens pockets, and changing Holinshed into Fox? Doth this man know, or care, what he saith? Or is there any one of these points, that prooueth any least falshood in me, & not rather all foure in him? How then is it heere againe brought in against me in this ninth obiection of

And the very same doth affirme Iohn Stow in his Chronicle saying, that for this (marriage) and for religion they conspired against the Queene &c. So as now hauing found out this, M. Morton cannot say,M. Mort. taken in a notorious open falshood. 
                  that I do wilily like a Fox prey furthest from home, for that before I did vrge only the authority of M. Fox, seeing that now both his proper Author Holinshed, and Stow are found expressely to affirme the self same. VVhich way will M. Morton turne himself heere? For he is conuinced of an open and manifest falshood, in denying that in two seuerall Replyes and Editions of his bookes, which now his owne author Holinshed is found flatly to affirme.

Morton to affirme it. For that there is no one of mine, that is to say Catholicke, that euer tooke out that sense of the words of Esay, that he doth: nor could they do it, the text not bearing any such interpretation, as before hath bene declared.

The peruerting of Carerius his text, as it lay in the Italian originall edition, to wit, in setting downe aduantagiously, and vrging Verè for Verò, which made a great difference in the sense, I could not omit to note, he standing thervpon so much as he did, and I neuer hauing heard before that time of any other edition. Now he saith, that he hath another later edition of Colen (which I neuer saw, nor could by any inquiry heare of, but now from M. Morton himselfe) wherin he a

Morton is not so excused by his Colen edition, but that he may be argued to legier-de-main for vrging so much Verè out of that sayd second print, differing from the Originall, for so much as euidently he might see by the drift and context of the author, that it could not be Verè Celsus, but rather Verò: wherin I referre me to that, which before hath bene treated against him more at large, and do conclude this his obiection, that if there were any wilfull falshood committed, it must needs lye on his part, and not on mine. He

goeth forward.

                  e, what simple furniture he hath for the matter taken in hand, to prooue witting & willfull falshood against me, such as cannot be excused, but that I must needes know them to be falsities, when  I vttered them (for this is our question, and of this sort do I produce multitudes against him and his:About Frisingē
                     sis corrupted by T. M.) as for example, in this his eleuenth obiection he accuseth me for noting him as a notable lyer: but if I prooued the same in the matter produced, then was i
                     •
                   no falshood, but truth in me: and if I did not, yet doth it not follow presētly that it was wilfull fraud, for it might be errour in me, that did persuade my self, that he had lyed in that point. But he that shall read the place here quoted,
                     See supra c. 1. §. 8. where before it is handled, shall finde, that the lye is iustifyed against M. Morton, and that there is not any such triple or simple instance making for his excuse, as here he pretendeth: and the like he shall find about the 12. obiection, concerning M. Mortons false and fraudulent allegation of the authour Frisingensis and that all the foure excellent feates of falshood there mentioned are prooued indeed to be but so many sooleries of his owne inuention. And with this he endeth his dozen of obiections against me. VVhereunto I hauing added the title of one more, M. Morton hath reserued

another for the vpshot of all, which he calleth both new and noble. Let vs heare what it is, and so end this whole Chapter.
            
            
               THE fourtenth, & last obiected falshood against P. R. §. XI.
               FOR this last place M. Morton hath reserued a  sure carde, which he calleth a new & noble falshood conuinced against me:Of the doctrine of Equiuocation graunted for 400. yeares. but the conuiction is not yet graunted by vs, but rather is like to light on his side. For wheras I had affirmed in my Treatise of Mitigation, that M. Morton had confessed in effect, that for the space of these last foure hundred yeares the doctrine of Equiuocation had byn receyued for true and lawfull doctrine in our Schooles, and consequently practised also throughout all Christendome, when iust occasion was offered &c.
                     Mitig. p. 279. Vpon this M. Morton falleth into a great distemper of speach saying: that by custome of falsity I haue cast of all sense of lying, fallen into a dead sleep, a
                        •
                     d cast away all conscience of truth,
                  
                     Preamb. p. 83. & the like. VVhich he pretendeth to proue by two points. First in that I do peruert his confession, for so much, that albeit he confesse the vse of Equiuocation for the space of these last foure hundred yeares: yet (sayth he) that he neuer acknowledged the same for so vniuersall, as that it was receiued in all Vniuersi
                        •
                     ies, Schooles, of all Deuines, Casuists &c. Nay, that he cōsuted this assertion of generality, by the sentence of our owne Doctour Genesius Sepulueda, who sayth, that Gabriel Biel a lewd Sophister set it abroach, & of him tooke it Siluester, Angelus, and some few other such

Glozers, but was not then so generally receiued among them. And hereof doth he inferre this new & noble falshood against me, as though I had auouched him to con
                     •
                  esse the generality therof in all Schooles, Vniuersities &c. for these foure hundred yeares.
               62. But in this I see not what aduantage M. Morton can take against me, not only of any falshood, wherin there must be voluntary errour, but neither of falsity, where errour happeneth by ouersight & infirmity. For first I said no more in my Treatise, then that M. Morton had manifestly set downe in his, to wit, that for these last foure hundred yeares, he graunted the lawfulnes of Equiuocation to haue byn taught in our Schooles. And consult (saith he) with the anciēt Logitians from the beginning of the world, till within the compasse of these last foure hundred yeares and lesse, that euer any Logitian did allow your mixt proposition partly mentall and partly verball, & I will &c.
                  
                     Full Satisf. par. 3. p. 54 Out of which exception for these last foure hundred yeares, is euidently deduced, that he graunteth the vse of such mixt propositions (which are properly Equiuocations) wherof one part is vttered, the other reserued in mind, as before hath byn declared.
               63. And therof I inferred further by euident consequence & sequele of reason (though he specified not the same) that for so much as our Catholicke Schooles were then ouer all Christendome & none publikely knowne or in vse but they,My inference of the generality of Equiuocation vpon M. Mortons graunt for 400. yeares. (for the first three hundreth at least of these foure) it must needes follow, that the same doctrine, during that time, was generally receiued in the said Scholes, Vniuersities &c. Wherof also may be alleadged for proofe amongst other points, that which M. Morton 
                  
                     •
                  iteth to the contrary, to wit, that Genesius Sepulueda of this our last age seemeth to be the only first

Author that M. Morton can produce for disallowing absolutely Equiuocation (though indeed he do not) and therby doth plainely prooue, that in the first three hundreth of these foure, there was no opposition found to haue byn made to the contrary, among so many multitudes of bookes and Authors, as are extant of those times: or if there had, that their opposition had byn extant, aswell as this of Sepulu
                        •
                     da.
               
               64. Neither did I say (as M. Morton would seeme to perswade his Reader) that, expressely and by name, he graunted the generall vse therof in all Schooles, Chaires, Vniuersities, Tribunalls, and the like, for these foure hundreth yeares: but I did by force of consequence inferre that he must needes graunt so much vpon his first confession of foure hundred yeares, as hath bene sayd. Neither can he auoid that inference and consequence, as hath byn demonstrated: for if it were a receiued doctrine among vs, and no ancient contradiction to be foūd, then must it needes in that antiquity be supposed to haue byn generall current doctrine in our Schooles, Vniuersities, Tribunalls &c.
                     Preamb. p. 84. For where no contradiction is found, there generall approbation may be presumed. Neither do I vouchsafe to answere to that obscure comparison of the French 
                        •
                     ox which M. Morton (though a Minister) is not ashamed to bring in for an example,M. Mort. obscene comp
                        •
                     rison. that some, yea & many haue had them in this age, and yet may we not conclude, that all haue had them: And the like (saith he) in the doctrine of Equiuocation, though some Schooles and Doctors haue taught it, yet not all. Wherto I answere that there is no parity. For if there had bene as many writers that had opposed them selues against the doctrine of Equiuocation, and vse therof in the foure hundred yeares,

and detesting the same, as there haue bene cleane men and women, that haue detested that other fowle disease, pro
                     •
                  essing themselues to be free therof; M. Morton would not haue bene in those straites that he is, for finding out one Author that contradicteth the same in all the time by him appointed, before Genesius Sepulueda, that only in some particuler Cases, reproueth the same, though granting and defending it in others. So as I leaue the filth of this comparison to the Author, and do conclude in this first point, that heere is nothing at all to be found, either of falshood or falsity in this obiection against me. For what I said, is iustified by M. Morton his owne wordes.
               65. There remaineth then the second point to be discussed. But noting first by the way, the lauish immodesty of M. Mortons tongue in citing the learned Doctor Gabriell Biel out of Genesius Sepulueda by the contemptuous title of lewd Sophister,
                  
                     Sepul. Dialogo Theophilus. c. 19. whereas Sepulueda stileth him in the same place, Theologum doctissimum, a most learned Diuine, and Tritemius who liued with him saith:
                     Tritemius lib. de Scriptor. Eccles. in Gabr. Biel.
                   
                  In diuinis Scripturis eruditus, ingenio excellens, vita & conuersatione praeclarus &c. Learned in the diuine Scriptures, excellent in wit, and famous for his good life and conuersation, Gouernor of the Vniuersity of Tubinga in Germany euen from the beginning therof, vnto the yeare 1494 which praises and 
                     •
                  uloges will neuer (I doubt me) be verified or giuen by any Author of credit or accompt,Iniury offered to Doct. Gabriel Biel. to M. Morton, that so scorneth and iniureth so graue and learned a man. And yet doth his grauity and humility make no bones to censure him for a lewd Sophister at the very first blow, whome perhaps he hath not read, and without (perhaps) vnderstandeth not in many points of chiefest learning. And this is the priuiledge of our new Doctors, to contemne

& reproach all others, though neuer so much learneder then themselues. But let vs go forward.
               66. The second point in his Paragraph is, that he taketh vpon him to checke the generall acceptāce of Equiuocation,
                     Preamb. p. 84. which I said to haue byn admitted in all Schooles, Vniuersities &c. for the space of foure hundreth yeares, by alleaging the contradiction of three 
                        •
                     amous learned 
                        •
                     esuits o
                        •
                      our time (for so now he calleth them,Three learned Iesuits wrested against Equiuocation. when they seeme som
                     •
                  what to serue his turne) to wit, Ioannes Azorius, Emanuel S
                        •
                     , and Ioannes Maldonatus, who in some particuler cases do reprehend, or not admitt all manner of Equiuocation. VVherin first is to be noted, that whereas M. Morton should haue shewed some contradictour of the three ages past, he nameth only the writers of our tyme, and those Iesuits also, which sort of men are euery where accused by him, as the Authors and speciall fauourers of Equiuocation, and now fyndeth none in effect to contradict it but them. VVherfore M. Morton and his fellowes must cease hereafter to accuse Iesuits so generally, as defenders of this doctrine, or els say, that they are contrary one to the other: or that there is some meaning and particuler sense in those that seeme to deny the same, which M. Morton therfore concealeth, for that being discouered, no contradiction would be found amongst them.
               
                  Iesuits restraine the vse of equiuocation but do not cōdemne it generally.67. And this mistery by him concealed is (which before also sundrie times we haue noted) not that any Iesuite doth vtterlie deny the lawfulnes of Equiuocation in all cases whatsoeuer, as bouldly and ignorantlie M. Morton doth, but for the restrayning of such abuses as may fall out in the practise therof, yf to much libertie be permitted, they are more seuere then other men in limiting the same, as more fullie

may appeare in part by our discourse in the last Chapter of the Treatise of Mitigation: where Catholicks are exhorted to vse the lawfulnes therof with great restraint and parsimony. And further the speach that in
                     •
                  ueth about these three learned writers Azor, Sà, & Maldonatus, all three Iesuites, and misalleadged by M. Morton, will more plainly make manifest the same.
            
            
               THE OPINION OF the Doctor Iesuite, Ioannes Azor, about Equiuocation falsly obiected by M. Morton, as making for him wheras it maketh wholy against him. §. XII.
               AND as for the first which is Azor, M. Morton bringeth him in with this Encomion, saying  in a speciall title: The first witnes conuincing P. R. of falshood, is Azorius a learned Iesuite:
                  Azor falsely alleaged against all Equiuocation. but I do wonder that M. Morton will bring him in againe heere, or suffer him to be so much as mentioned, I hauing conuinced him in my Treatise of Mitigation of so notorious and wilfull a fraud and corruption in alleadging Azor his words about Equiuocation in an Oath,

                     Mit. c. 11. nu. 18.19. pag. 450. & 451. But now let vs see notwithstanding further what Azorius saith against Equiuocation in generall, for to this effect he is brought in, in this place, as though he held that all Equiuocation were to be reiected as lying: for proofe wherof he citeth two places out of the selfe same leafe and page of Azorius. The first wherof

Mort. and in what matters that occasions they may Equiuocate, or may not, he setteth downe distinctly in fiue seuerall Rules. Wherof M. Mo

For that in the first he resolueth, that a Priest may equiuocate, and say he knoweth nothing, whē he is demanded any point about Confession. In the second he resolueth, that whensoeuer any man is

demanded by an incompetent Iudge, euen in an Oath, whether he hath committed this or that sinne, he may by Equiuocation deny the same euen in an Oath. Wherof he giueth many reasons, and resolueth sundry other cases by vertue of the same Rule. As if a man be wrongfully compelled by a Iudge to say, or sweare that he will pay such a summe of money to his aduersary, he may sweare it (saith Azor) though he haue no intention to performe it, as being against law, hauing this reseruation in his mynd, that he will pay so much as by law he is bo
                        •
                     
                     ̄d: & three or foure other like Cases besids in the explicatiō of this Rule.
               70. By his third Rule he proueth the like in other Cases, beginning his Rule with these words Quoties in conuictu hominum communi &c.
                  Diuers cases resolued by Azor for Equiuocation. As often as in the common conuersation of men we are demaunded of any thing, and driuen to sweare it, if any iniury therin be offered vnto vs, it is law
                     •
                  ull for vs in swearing to vse ambiguous words, and to take them in our se
                     •
                  se so far forth as the words may beare that sense, albeit in the minds of the hearers they do ingender an other sense. And by this Rule he resolueth two seuerall Cases: that an adulterous wife being vnlawfully demanded by her husba
                     •
                  d whether she haue committed adultery?An adultresse how she may equiuocate. she may, if the adultery be secret, sweare that she hath committed no adultery, reseruing in her mind, that she hath committed none, so as she is bound to confesse it vnto him. This is Azor his resolution. And is not this our Case plainly? doth not this hit the nayle on the head also against M. Morton?
               71. Two other Cases in like māner he resolueth by the force of this Rule. First, that if a man fall into the hands of a theef,How Equiuocation may be vsed to a theef. a tyrant, or an enemy, or of any other that doth vex him iniuriouslie, and be forced to sweare and promise any thing by oath,

he may equiuocate, and is not bound afterward to performe that which he promised vpon wrongfull coaction. The second Case is the Couen
                        •
                     ry Case, which M. Morton in his former book did greatly reprehend, and iest at, but learned Azor (as M. Morton calleth him) houldeth it for true and iustifiable, to wit, that if a man should, for example sake, come from Couentry, or any other Cittie, that is suspected to haue the plague, and indeed hath it not, nor is himselfe otherwise infected:The Couentry case about comming from an infected place. but yet should be demanded at the gates of London whether he came from Couentry or no? he might lawfully answere, he came not: vnderstanding in his mind, that he came not from Couentry, as infected. And all these Cases doth Azor resolue vnder his first three Rules: which are all directly against M. Morton as you see. And in his behalf there is nothing, either in these or in the other two, which haue no particuler Cases assigned them, but only haue this in generall.
               72. The fourth rule of Azor is: Si nulla nobis 
                        •
                     iat iniuria &c.
                  If no iniury be offered vs when we  are demanded any thing, it is not lawfull to vse ambiguous wordes, except in that sense which the hearers do conceiue. The fifth, Si reuerà verba  quibus vtimur &c. If indeed the words which we do vse are no doubtfull in their signification, nor in the cōmon vse of men, nor haue any other sense but only one, we must vse them in that sense which they yeeld. Neither is it lawfull for vs, albeit we should be demanded against all law and right to wrest it into another sense by any cogitation of our mind. For it is neuer lawfull for vs to lye: but he doth lye, that doth take wordes in another sense then they do signifie.
So Azor. Where you see that he forbiddeth only, that wordes which haue but one only naturall sense and signification,

and are not ambiguous or of diuers senses, should be vsed by the speaker in any other significatiō then naturally, or by common vse amongst men they do yeeld: as for example, if one that had a horse & not an oxe, should be demaunded, whether he had any horse, he should saie noe, meaning that he had noe Oxe, for that he conceiued an Oxe for an horse, this were not lawfull, saith Azor, in the vse of words, because the word horse hath but one proper meannig amongst men, and cannot signifie an Oxe: and consequently cannot be so taken but by a lye. But if the word horse had a doubtful or double significatiō, signifying as well an Oxe as a horse, then might a man vse the amphibology of the word, to auoyd any iniury offered him by an incompetent Iudge, as Azor himselfe determineth.
               73. But now (to returne to the matter) what is this against our Clause of Reseruation in a propositiō or sentence? And how doth this strike the nayle on the head for M. Morton? Nay, doth not Azor strike M. Mort. on the head directly, insteed of the nayle, & most manifestly in the first, second and third Rules, & by all the different Cases therin resolued? Who would thinke then that a man of cōmon sense, or of any meane modesty & care of his credit would haue alleaged Azor so cōfidently against his aduersary, as M. Morton doth? & that which is most ridiculous, so to insult against him, as he doth against me here, saying:
P. R. māteineth that his mentall reseruation is a truth: but Azorius concludeth that it is a lye.Insolent fond insulting. And can there be any greater cō
                     tradiction the
                        •
                      this? Hath he any shadow of excuse by ignorance of the Author and place? No, for he hath alledged this Author vpon this question of Equiuocation foure tymes.
                        Preamb. pag. 86. Is he helped by dif
                     
                        •
                     erence of translations or editions? Noe, he will not pretend this. Therfore no euasion can saue him:

and therby any man may discerne, what credit such wretched Equiuocators may deserue. So M. Morton.
               
               74. Wherto I answere, that not only foure times, but perhapps twice foure times haue I alleaged the authority of Azor for the lawfull vse of Equiuocation against M. Morton,
                  Azor proued to defend Equiuocation. and in diuers of them he hath byn so manifestly conuinced of witting & willing falshood, as there is no de
                     •
                  ence or excuse to be had. Nay, he doth not so much as pretend any defence therof hitherto, nor I thinke shall I find any of thē defended by him in the ensuing Chapter, though it be expressely deputed to this argument to answering diuers manifest and wilfull vntruthes layd to his chrage. Wherfore to say (as he doth heer) that I haue no shadow of excuse by ignorance of the Author and place &c.
                  Fiue different fraudes & lyes at one time. is only to intertaine talke, and to seeme to 
                     •
                  ay somwhat: for I am not charged with any thing that requireth excuse, but he is conuinced of voluntary concealing of fiue or six different Cases resolued against him by Azor, as you haue heard, and passed ouer by M. Morton, as if he had not seene them: so as euery one of them includeth a witting fraud in him, that admitteth no excuse. Let vs come to his second learned Iesuite, whome he bringeth in for deniyng of Equiuocation, which you shall see to be no lesse contrary vnto him then the former, and especially to teach Equiuocation to be lawfull, in the very places alleadged by M. Morton.
               
            
            
               
               M. MORTON His second witnesse falsely pretended against Equiuocation is the Doctor Iesuite Emanuel Sà. §. XIII.
               A SECOND witnesse saith M. Morton conuincing  P. R. of falshood is the authority of Emanuel Sà, a famous learned Iesuit among Casuists,
                  Emanuel Sà vntruly alleaged against all Equiuocation. as heere he is called, whose wordes are set downe thus out of his Aphorismes: Quidam dicunt &c. Some there be who say, that he who is not bound to answere to the intention of the examiner, may answere by reseruation of some thing in his owne mynd, to witt, that it is not so, that is to say,
                     Sà in Aphoris. verbo mendacium 3. & 4. 
                  so as he is bound to vtter it vnto him: or that he hath not such, or such a thing: to wit, to giue it vnto him: Albeit others do not admit this manner of answering, and peraduenture vpon better reason then the former. Thus far Emanuel Sà: alleaged also as M. Morton saith,
                     Satisf. part. 1. cap. 26. Moderat. Answ. c. 10 by his former aduersary the moderate Answerer. But how truly and sincerly M. Morton here dealeth with him in this behalf we shall see presently after. Now is to be considered, what he doth inferre out of this authority against Equiuocation in generall, for thus he maketh his inference vpon the recited text. Thus far Emanuel Sà (saith he) confessing hereby that diuers Catholike Authors haue contradicted this equiuocating sorgerie,
                  
                     Pream. 86. 
                  which P. R. hath auouched, that no Catholike writer did euer contradict. Is it possible that my aduersary can free himself from a falsity corroding the conscience?
               
               76. Wherto I answere, that euen now it shalbe tried, who hath a corroded Conscience in this matter,

he or I: and let the Reader stand attent,The Reader required to stād attent. for that M. Morton maie not escape vntill he haue satisfied somwhat. First then my assertion was, that no Catholike writer within the time by him ascribed of the last foure hundred yeares hath byn 
                     •
                  ound to deny absolutely all Equiuocation without exception: albeit in particuler Cases (as this is here proposed by Emanuel Sà) some School-doctors were of one opinion, and some of another, some more strait and some more large. The Case proposed heere by Emanuel Sà, is of a man that hath no obligation to answere to the intention of him that demaundeth, whether he may answere with Equiuocation or noe, and say that it is not so, vnderstanding (with obligation to tell it you:) or I haue it not (to giue vnto you.) In which particuler Case he saith, that some men do not admit that kind of answere: but for so much as he hath no obligatiō to answere any thing at all, he is bound either to hold his peace or tell the truth. And perhaps (saith he) this later opinion is the better, fortè potiori ratione non admittunt. So as heere he speaketh but by (perhaps) that a man may not equiuocate in this Case:
                     Eman. Sà in Aphor. verbo Mē
                     dac. 3. & 4. which word (perhaps) M. Morton craftily omitted: and indeed in the last edition of his booke at Rome 1607. this whole last sentence was left out, as though he had cha
                     •
                  
                  ged his opinion. But howsoeuer this be, this is but one particuler Case of Equiuocation, as hath byn said, and M. Morton could not but know it, and consequently doth vse notable fraud, when vpon the different opinions of some Schoole doctors in this speciall Case (when a man is not bound to answere) he would inferre (as here he doth) that diuers Catholick authors do contradict and deny Equiuocation in generall, that is to say, all kind of Equiuocation in what case soeuer.
               
                  77. And that M Morton could not choose but know this to be a fraud, & consequētly the fraud to be wilfull, is euident:Wilfull fraud inexcusable. for that in the very next foure lynes going imediately before the former alleaged words, Emanuel Sà doth resolue two other Cases, wherin a man might equiuocate, saying:

                     Petenti quae ei reddidisti, pot
                           •
                        s negare te accepisse &c. if a man that had left some pledge with you, and you had restored the same to him againe, he should afterwards demand the same the second tyme,Equiuocation in case of restitution. and presse you with an oath about the same: you might lawfully deny that you had receiued any such pledg, vnderstāding in your mynd that you receiued it not, in such sort as you are boūd now to restore it. And againe: if a man (saith he) should demand the whole s
                        •
                     me of money, wherof he had receiued backe a part: you might deny the said petition, saying: that you owe it not, vnderstanding of the whole, or of so much as he wrōgfully demādeth. So as in both these Cases Emanuel Sà confesseth, that Equiuocation may be vsed, as you see.
And how then is he brought in heere by M. Morton, as a witnesse denying all Equiuocation, or at leastwise as saying, that there are diuers opinions about the same, which is in part also false, for that Emanuel Sà doth not say, that there is doubt or differēce of opinions, whether any Equiuocation at all be allowable: but only whether in this or that particuler Case it be to be admitted.
               78. This then is euident and witting fraud in M. Morton,
                  
                     Aphor. 25
                        •
                      
                     de Confes.
                   for that besides the former two Cases resolued in approbation of Equiuocation, Emanuel Sà hath many more,Sūdry cases resolued for Equiuocation by Emanuel Sà.
                   which M. Morton probably could not but know, as amongst others these: Potest Confessor iurare se nihit scire &c. The Priest that heareth Confessions may lawfully sweare, that he knoweth nothing, nor that he hath heard any thing in Confession: vnderstanding in his mind, (so as he is

bound to vtter the same.) Againe: the penitent may sweare, that he sayd nothing,
                  
                     Ibid.
                   or no such thing, as he is demanded in Cōfession, though he had said it. And moreouer in another place:
                     Aphor. 8. de Testib.
                   
                  Non legitimè interrogatus &c. He that is not lawfully demanded, may deny that he knoweth the thing he is demanded (though he know it indeed) vnderstanding in his mind, that he knoweth it not so, as he is boūd to open it to him. And yet further:
                     Aphor. 7. de Reo.
                   
                  Reus non tenetur &c. He that is accused is not bound to confesse those thinges, for which if they were reuealed, he should vniustly be condemned: Wherfore he may deny them, vnderstanding in his mind (that he hath not donne them so, as he is bound to vtter them.) And now will any man say, but M. Morton, that the learned Iesuit Emanuel Sà, is a good witnesse against all vse of Equiuocation? Doth not euery one of these examples conuince him of wilfull fraud? And consequently these foure examples dissembled by him are foure seuerall falshoods wittingly and willingly cōmitted? But let vs see one notable shift more, which is the fifth new falshood, before we passe to his third witnesse.
               79 He doth cite the forsayd authority of Emanuel Sà against Equiuocation, alleadged by his first aduersary (the moderate Answerer) and to couer himselfe the better with his shadow, doth dissemble that he hath looked vpon the Author himselfe, to the end he may haue some hole to runne out, when he shall be pressed with these wilfull corruptions of Emanuel Sà, and his meaning. But yet he could not do this handsomly inough, but he must also egregiously abuse and falsify the words of his said aduersary, making him seeme to inferre out of this particuler Case, an absolute deniall of all Equiuocation. To which end after the forsaid wordes of Emanuel

Sà recited, he maketh him to conclude thus: VVherby it is mani
                        •
                     est, that all Catholicks do not allow of Equiuocation; and then himselfe saith (I meane M. Morton:) Thus farre he, conf

                     ss

                     orgery.
               
               80. But ô M. Morton, let me pose you heere:M. Mort. is posed. Is it true that your aduersary sayd, so farre, and no further to the purpose in hand? Or is it rather true, that you cut him of, and would suffer him to say no further? Surely your bad dealing is not excusable in this point. For your aduersary did fully cleare the mater, if you would haue permitted him to tell out his tale: for these are his wordes: VVherby it is mani
                        •
                     est, that all Catholicks do not allow of Equiuocation,
                  
                     Moderate Answerer c. 11. initio.
                   
                  where he is not bound to answere the Iudge or examiner proceeding vniustly and not according to law and equity. By which words he declareth playnely, that he alleadged not Emanuel Sà, as denying all Equiuocation, or as making Catholick Authors to doubt of it among thēselues, as M. Morton doth vntruly impose vpon them: but only he teacheth, that not in euery particuler Case whatsoeuer, where he that is demanded is not bound to answere, do all Catholicks allow of Equiuocatiō. For that where there is no iniury offered, nor violence vsed, some thinke it better (or rather obligation) that he should hold his peace, then Equiuocate. But this is reported but as a particuler opinion in this particuler Case, which it seemeth that Emanuel Sà did afterward change, as before hath byn said.
               81. Now then to conclude, consider (gentle Reader) in how many witting and willfull falshoods M. Morton, in producing this one forced witnes, hath heere byn ta

                  en, both against Emanuel Sà, my self and his moderate Answerer. Against Emanuel Sà, in falsyfying him contrary to his owne words and drift, making him to condemne all equiuocation

                     •
                  ontrary to Emanuel Sà, that no Catholike writer did euer contradict any kind of Equiuocation: which I neuer affirmed, but rather granted that in this or that particuler Case, there might be difference of opinions: but my assertion was and is, that none did euer absolutely deny all vse therof, in euery Case. Against his moderate Answerer in like manner he vseth fraude, in that wilfully he cut of those words that explaine the whole matter about the meaning of Emanuel Sà. All which notwithstanding, will he needs be talking of corroded consciences, as though his Conscience were cleere, & smooth among so many & manifold false tricks as are cōuinced against him. But let vs leaue this, & passe to the third witnesse.
            
            
               M. MORTON His third Iesuite Doctor brought in to witnesse against Equiuocation, to wit, Ioannes Maldonatus. §. XIIII.
               
                   HE intituleth this Paragraph, The third witnesse conuincing P. R. of falshood, presupposing that the former two haue done the same:Ioannes Maldonatus falsly alleadged for a witnesse against all E
                        •
                     uiuocation. but how contrary that hath fallen out, and of how many falshoods M. Morton himself hath byn by them and their occasion conuinced, the Reader hath now seene & considered I doubt not. Let vs peruse then that which he writeth of this third, which wilbe found to haue no more against P. R. then the former two, which in effect is nothing at all: yet shall we lay

forth what M. Morton produceth in this behalf. Thus then he beginneth his narration.

R. could not be ignorant of, because he indeauoured to satisfy other testimonies, as of Genesius & Sotus: but this Author Maldonat specifyed in the same place (as the weaker aduersary will do his ouermatch) he did willingly pretermit.
                  So M. Morton,

But as in all other places lightly which he citeth he dealeth vnsincerely, whē any waies it may make for his purpose: So here, if the Reader will but take the payns as to turne to the place quoted of my Booke, he shall discouer more then simple shifting.

Morton, which he doth not so much as go about to answere here, nor euer wilbe able.

               86. For to make Maldonate of more weight & credit,

as though he had said somewhat against me, and in his behalfe; he beginneth with this description of him.
                     Preamb. p. 87. 
                  Maldonate (saith he) a principall Iesuite and Casuist resolueth thus &c. and in his booke of Full Satisfact. he citing the selfe same sentence of Maldonate, which he doth heere, beginneth with this preamble:

                     Not only Sotus (saith he) called among you the subtil Doctor, but euen the subtilest of all your Iesuits calleth your Equiuocating, ranke lying: saying, whosoeuer doth endeuour by feigning to deceaue another, although he intend to signifie somewhat els, doubtles he lyeth.
In which two Prefaces to pretermit all other pointes yow maie note two grosse ouerslippes:Two absurdityes cōuinced against M Morton. the first in stiling Maldonate a Casuist, who is neuer knowne to haue read or written of Cases in his life, but Scholasticall diuinitie he professed many yeares in Paris, and left very learned Commentaries vpon all the foure Euangelists, though the Roman Index Expurgatorius Anno Dom. 1607. doe mention, that certaine Cases of Conscience published by another & printed at Lions An. 1604. were falslie ascribed to him. The second, that Dominicus Sotus was Iohn Scotus the subtile doctor, which liued aboue 200. yeares before Sotus, wherof I admonished him before in the Treatise of Mitigation, and yet he would needs renew againe the memory therof in this Preamble, by sending mē to peruse what I answered before to Sotus, and thereby reueale his owne shame.
               87. But now what hath Maldonatus here in the sentence alleaged, that I should willinglie pretermit to answere, as being ouermatched therewith? doth Maldonate say any thing in this sentence that is not conforme to our Common doctrine of Equiuocation? Noe truelie. For we graunt, that whosoeuer doth endeuour by feigning to deceiue another, doth lye. In so much as it agreeth well with the definitiō of a

                  The Rule, saith he, which in many other places we haue set downe is heere to be obserued, to wit, that generall propositions in the Scriptures are to be vnderstood with certaine conditions not expressed, but only conceiued in mind,Maldonat teacheth plainl

               92. Heere then you see that Maldonate doth expresslie teach, not onlie the lawfullnes, but also the necessitie of reserued Equiuocation in some

Cases. Now then to conclude, we see what help the Iesuite Maldonat, drawne in for a third witnes, hath brought to M. Morton, that is to saie, he hath testified plainly against him. And yet yow must haue patience to heare his triūphant cōclusion after his manner.
Now (saith he) haue I instāced this generall propositiō of all Vniuersities, Deumes, Casuists, approuing this doctrine in three famous Iesuits and Casui

I haue exceeded the proportion of our Mitigators demand, who required but two or three instances in any, though of himselfe: I haue offered him thirteene vnsatisfiable falshoods, as many as I could well bundle vp in this brief Preamble, reseruing the rest for the exact Encoūter, whē I doubt not, but vpon the discouery of his vnconscionable deprauations, he will wish, that his braines had byn a sleep, when he framed this Mitigation.
                  
               
               93. This is his Conclusion, still singing the victory as you see. And it shall not need for me to answere any points therof: for that they are either euidently false or impertinent. I said that for these last foure hundred yeares the doctrine of Equiuocation in some Cases hath euer byn admitted, and neuer knowne to be wholie controlled by any. He bringeth forth three Iesuits of our time against this,A briefe answer to the follies before promised. who were so farre of from denying the doctrine of all Equiuocation, as they teach the same expressely in sundry Cases, as now you haue heard. This then rather deserueth laughter of the Reader, then any confutation by me. He saith it is con

               THE FINALL Reckoning of this whole Chapter. §. XV.
               
                   TO passe then to summe vp the accompt of this whole Chapter briefly & frendly with M. Morton:The conclusion of all these 15. Paragraphes. let the reader remember, how at the beginning therof, for so much as, I was so bound (to vse his wordes) as to insert my selfe also in the offer made, that if two or three such wil
                        •
                     ull falshods, as there I described (wherin nothing can excuse from witting malice) should be found in my writings, I would discredit my selfe, and would be content to be discredited for euer, and esteeme my selfe vnworthy to take pen in hand againe: for this confident speach, I say, M. Morton condēned me and my cōscience for worse then no conscience at all, promising to proue it in this Chapter by the matters to be obiected vnto me: and further added as you haue heard, let our Reader witnesse betwene me and him according to the euidence of testimonies, which shalbe brought against him.
                  
                     Preamb. pag. 71. Now the testimonies haue byn brought forth, and viewed by the Reader, thirteene in number, as M. Mort. reckoneth

them, but fourteene in my accompt.Exceeding vaunting. All which do conteine (as he affirmeth) vnsatisfiable falshoods and irreuocable falles, and that so apparent 
                        •

               95. This was his promise then, and is his vaunt now.
                     Pream. p. 71. sup. §. 1. I for my part demand performance, and that the Reader giue his iudgmēt. And as for these fourteene obiections now brought against me, they might be aswell foure hundred of that kind, which they are, as foureteene; that is to say, of no force in the world to the question heere handled of witting and wil
                        •
                     ull falshood. For as for the most part of them, he cannot so much as pretend any such malice to be in them.
                     Pag. 72. For what malice could there be in interpreting the letters T. M. for Thomas Morton in my Dedicatory Epistle written after the Treatise ended (which is his first charge against me) and yet saying before, that vntill that time, I had not knowne that Name to haue bene meant by these letters?
                     Pag. 72. What profit might my cause gaine therby? As also by wilfull erring (if it had bene an errour,
                     Pag. 81.) in counting how many times M. Morton had set downe the Clause of reseruation in latin?
                     Pag. 82. What gayne might I pretend by applying that to all Catholicke Priests & teachers in their degrees, which M. Mortō
                   scornfully obiected to his Aduersary, as to a Priest, in contempt of all Priests?
               96. And with these he beginneth his charge, and endeth with no better. For what do make to the purpose those other last obiections, as that I reprehended him for placing, as his poesy in the first page of his booke against Catholicks, Stay your selues, for they are blind and make others blind: where as neither the originall Hebrew, nor Syriack, Greek or Latin ancient translations haue it so? That I noted him to haue vsed and vrged Verè for Verò out of Carerius
                  
contrarie to the edition which I had of that booke? And like to these, are the other three that ensue in him, which are but verie light & vaine toyes. And if they should be all granted, as they ly, they would proue nothing of moment, concerning the question in hand. And yet doth he repeat them againe and againe, and some of them three times, as though they were great matters against me. Can there be any more poore and miserable dealing then this?
               97. But besides this, I presume not only to haue cleared my self in all these trifles obiected by him, but further also, to haue conuinced my aduersarie commonly in euery one of his obiections, to haue cōmitted some new manifest falsities himsel

                  usion by bringing them in. There remaineth nothing then for the ending of this accompt, but that the Reader, as chie

For that hitherto hath bene handled only, what he hath pretended to be able to say against Catholicke writers, and me his aduersary; which hath bene so weake, poore and pittifull, as now you haue seene, euery battery of his, recoyling commonly vpon his owne head. But the next three Chapters are to conteine the fight made vpon himselfe,
                     Chap. 5. for three sorts of falsities. First such as he goeth about to defend, and cannot:

pretermitteth to mention, for that he could not cleare himselfe therin: and the third, such as he hath committed a new,
                     Cap. 7. in going about to defend and cleare the old: and then after that, you are to see and behould his multitude of new braggs and Challenges, as though notwithstanding all this, he had had the victory in the former: so confident the man is in his owne concepts.

                PREFACE.
               
                  I FIND the saying of the Philosophers, That the thing which is last in execution, is first in our intention, to be verified in this Preāble of M. Morton: for that his principall intentiō being to quit himselfe, so farre as he might, of the odious imputation of so many wilfull vntruthes obiected vnto him by P. R. in his Treatise of Mitigation, and

that the importance of the matter o

                  est imputations laid against him:Volūtary wandring from the purpose. Yet hath he delaid the matter as you see vnto this last place, intertaining himselfe first in certaine idle, and impertinent skirmishes with his Aduersary: As whether he be a man o
                        •
                      sufficiency, wit, memory, skill in Logi

                     ke, Greeke and Hebrew, and the like, and then taking in hand to touch two or three litle points about the argument and subiect of his Aduersaryes Booke: and thirdly obiecting falsities to others, that he alone might not seeme to be culpable: and so finally he commeth by litle and litle, though vnwillingly, as it appeareth, like a beare to the stake, to the point first intended, which is to deliuer himselfe from some small number of a greater multitude of manifest vntruthes obiected against him, out of which multitude he saith,
                     Preamb. pag. 88. 
                  That he hath singled out fourteene, not such as might seeme vnto him most easily answered, but those which P. R. hath most vehemently pressed and vrged.
               
               2. In both which assertions he swarueth againe from the truth, as presently will appeare: for that the Reader by taking the view, aswell of those that he hath pretended to answere, as of the rest, that he hath willingly pretermitted,A manifest falsity. will see (and so shall we also demonstrate in the next Chapter) that those which he hath ouerpassed are much more both in number and force, then these which he hath produced, and consequently hath singled out such as might seeme vnto him most easily answered: the other part also of his ass
                     •
                  rtion is false, that P. R. hath most ve
                     •
                  emently pressed & vrged against him these which he hath answered for that he presseth and

vrgeth most the corruptions against Bellarmine, Azor, Sayer, Sotus, Cicero, Victoria, and others, which shall be set downe more particulerly in the next Chapter, and therby conuince M. Morton of ouerlashing in this behalfe.
               3. Of all which M. Morton hath made heere no mention, and besides this, hath laid togeather in these fourteene, diuers of small weight and momēt, and some handled before vpon other occasions. As for example, about the place of Esay the 29. which was but lightly obiected vnto him for an ouersight. And the like in vrging verè for verò out of Carerius, brought in heere by him the third tyme to make vp a number. And the like about a citation of Dolman, that was handled before. His 12. obiection also in this Chapter about the succession of Protestāt Princes, and the 13. about an allegation out of Frisingensis, haue byn all handled before,A fond vaunt. and brought in by him againe and agayne, therby to make a shew, that he answereth to many things: wheras in truth, he answereth to nothing truly and substantially; no, not indeed to the easiest of these, which heere he hath picked out, to shew his manhood in defending them. And yet he saith in the Preface of this Chapter,
                     Preamb. pag. 88. 
                  That he hopeth to giue such satisfaction to all, as that not only the wound of slaunder may be cured, but euen also the suspicious scarre of imputation may be wyped away.
               
            
            
               
               THE FIRST obiected falsity pretended to be answered by Thomas Morton §. I.
               IN the first front of his squadrō of 14. obiected falsities, chosen by him heere to be defended, he placeth  a reprehension of mine,About Popes names chā
                     ged out of Polidore. Preamb. ibid.
                   made vnto him in my Epistle dedicatory to the Vniuersities, for that in his Epist
                     •
                  e to the K. Maiestie of his Treatise, intituled A full Satisfaction, he vseth these calumnious words:

                     Polidore obserueth (saith he) that the Popes a long time in their election, had their names changed by Antiphrase, viz. the elected, if he were by naturall disposition fearfull, was named Leo, if cruell, Clemens, if vnciuill, Vrbanus, if wicked, Pius, if couetous, Bonifacius, if in all behauiour intollerable, Innocentius &c. This speach as malicious and contumelious, & fraught with deceiptfulnes, I iustly reprehended; noting by the way that he had cited no place in Polidore, wheras he hath written sundry books besides his histories.
I noted also that diuers Kinges and Princes might haue names whose significations might be farre different from their qualities and actions: and that Popes, since the beginning of that custome of changing their names after their election, did not take names by antiphrase or contrariety of sense, as this man seditiously did insinuate, but for reuerence, commonly, of other holy Popes who pas

                  m, whose names they tooke, as I exemplified in many: and yet not hauing Polidore then by me (I meane that worke of his de Inuentoribus Rerum) I passed ouer diuers other

pointes of deceiptfull sleightes in him, which I might haue vrged, and now must needes in part touch, for that to this accusation of myne, he hath nothing to answere in this his Reply, but this which ensueth.
               
                  
                     Preamb. 8

                        ••
                     .5. First that albeit he cited not any certayne booke or place out of Polidores workes; yet that the sentence reported by him vpon his memory, is found in Polidore his fourth booke de inuentoribus Rerum c. 10. which is intituled, De origine honorum qui Romano Pontifici hab

                  ches. And albeit this obseruation of Polidore mentioned by M. Morton be not found in any of our Bookes, now commonly extant: yet, he saith, that they are in his booke of the edition of Basilea of the yeare 1570. and that two yeares after that by order of Pope Pius Quintus,
                  
                     Pream. pag. 90. the Index expurgatorius did put out these wordes,
                     Lib. expurgat. ex Hispanico & Belgico verbo Polidorus p. 457. but he telleth not what Index it was, for I haue one containing both the Spanish & Flemish Index, wherin it is written about Polidore Virgil thus: Ex Indice Louaniensi quae in Polidoro Virgilio de rerum inuentoribus Basileae impresso anno 1544. in octauo, corrigenda sunt atque delenda. The things that are to be corrected, or blotted out in Polidore Virgil (in his eight bookes) of the first inuentors of things, which worke of his was printed at Basilea in octauo, vpon the yeare of Christ 1544.
               6. Out of which wordes it may be presumed, as to me it seemeth, that vpon the said yeare of Christ 1544. whiles Polydore Virgil lyued yet in England, his worke de inuentoribus Rerum, though it were printed at Basile, where Protestant Religion was entred, yet this place of Polidor about changing of Popes names was not found, for that being both scandalous

and vntrue (as presently shall be shewed) it is very like,A great probability that Polidore is abused. or rather certaine, that this our Index expurgatorius would haue noted it at least, as it doth diuers other thinges, not only out of the same worke, but euen out of the same 4. booke and 2.3.4.5.6.7. and 8. Chapters, and yet saith nothing at all of any thing of the tenth, where M. Morton saith this his obseruation is now found in his booke printed at Basile 1570. which was 26. yeares a
                     •
                  ter the former edition: wherof must needes be inferred, that either M. Morton dealeth not sincerely with vs (which yet in this matter I will not bee so vnfriendly as to suspect) or that his edition of 1570
                     •
                   (which hitherto I cannot see) hath receaued this addition about the Popes changing their names after the foresaid edition of 1544. which could not be from Polidore himselfe, who was dead before, but from some new merry brother of Basile, then hereticall, who to make sport, put it in for a merriment indeed, for so in the text it selfe he professeth that he wrote it in iest, though it pleaseth M. Morton to take it vp in earnest.
               7. But let vs heare the wordes themselues which M. Morton setteth downe as found in his Polidore.
                  
                     Primus honos (saith he) Romano Pontifici habetur, vt si minùs pulchro honestetur nomine, ei statim creato liceat illud mutare: verbi gratia (quòd non extra iocum dictum sit) si homo maleficus antea fuerit, vt Bonifacius appelletur, si timidus, Leo, si rusticus, Vrbanus &c. This is the first honour giuen to the Bishop of Rome after his creation (saith he) that if his name be not fayre, he may chāge the same: as for example, (which yet be not spoken but in iest) if before he had byn perhaps an euill doer, he may be called Bonifacius, that is a good doer, if he had byn fearfull, then may he be called Leo, a lyon, if

                        usticall, then Vrbanus, or ciuill &c. And the first Author

(or beginner) of this custome is said to haue bin Pope Sergius the 2. whose name hauing bin before Os Porci, which signyfi

                        •
                     d Polidore) for auoyding the obscenity of his former name to change the same.
               
               8. Thus much out of M. Mortons Polidore,
                  
                     Preamb. pag. 80. & 90. wherof he vaunteth according to his fashion in these words:
Although they haue made Polidore by their Index expurgatorius almost in euery page dumbe, not suffering him to beare witnesse against the pryde of Popes &c. yet our ancient Polidore now dwelling among Protestants printed anno 1570. Basileae,
                     The tale out of Polidore cō
                        futed. hath a tongue that will tell tales.
So he. Speaking more truly then perhaps he imagineth that his Polidore in this poynt telleth meere tales indeed, and consequently, is no great iewell of antiquity to be bragged of, as dwelling now among Protestants. For now I haue shewed that in a more ancient edition then this by 26. yeares, this treasure so much bragged of by M. Morton, is not extant.
               9. And as for the two pointes touched therin, the one a iest (as himselfe tearmeth it) about changing of names by antiphrase, the other of the first occasion therof by Pope Sergius,
                  
                     Platina in vita Sergij secundi.
                   neither of them hath any sound subsistance at all: for that to speake first of the second, the narration of Platina in the life of Pope Sergius 2. who was chosen Pope vpon the yeare of Christ 844. that he being called first Os Porci, or Os-Porcius, changed his name into Sergius, himselfe proposeth the matter very doubtingly, saying: Sunt qui dicant, there are some who say, that Sergius 2. was called before Os Porci, and so changed his name Vt
                        •
                     unque sit, constat Sergium ex Illustri familia natum, howso
                     •
                  uer be it, it is 
                     •
                  uident that this Sergius was of a Noble Familie: so as heere Platina relateth it

but as a report of some, and namely, as is thought, out of Martinus Polonus a simple credulous writer, as all learned men do know.
               10. But further then this Onuphrius Panuinus a very learned man of our age,
                     Onuphrius Panuinus in vita Sergii 2. confuteth this tale much more effectually out of the history of Anastasius Bibliothecarius, that according to the accompt of Tritemius & other learned men, lyued in that very tyme when Pope Sergius did,
                     Anastasius Bibliothecarius ibidem.
                   and had chiefe care of the Roman Library, and wrote the life of this Sergius 2. and therin sheweth euidently where, & of what noble parents he was borne, how brought vp, by what meanes chosen Pope, and that before his Popedome he was called Sergius, and saith no word of changing of his name, nor of Os Porci, and yet he may be presumed to haue byn present at his election by the many particularityes which he setteth downe of the same. Besides it is to be noted,Consider of this reason. that Os Porci, or Os-Porcius is the surname of the family, which no Pope is wont to change, but only the Christian or proper Name, as when of late Hippolytus Aldobrandinus was called Clemens 8. he changed not the name of Aldobrandinus, but only of Hippolytus: and the like in other Popes, wherefore though the surname of Sergius had bin Os Porci, yet would he neuer haue changed that, but only his proper name.
               11. The forsaid Onuphrius also in his notes vpon the life of Pope Iohn the 12. a noble Roman, called before Octauianus,
                  What Pope first changed his name. who was chosen Pope vpon the yeare 955. (more then a hundred yeares after Sergius) sheweth by many arguments, that he was the first of the Popes that changed their names at their election. And Cardinall Baronius hauing found an old Epitaph written in marble in the Church of S. Iohn Lateran in Rome of Pope Sergius the fourth, chosen

Pope vpon the yeare 1009. (an other hundred yeares after the for
                     •
                  said Pope Iohn the 12.) doth manifestly shew out of this Epitaph, that the said Sergius the fourth, being called Peter before, did out of the reuerence and respect he bare to that name leaue it, and tooke the name of Sergius, which was the cause why others, especially Martinus Polonus, mistaking one Sergius for another, did ascribe it to Sergius the second.
               12. But howsoeuer this be (as Platina before said) concerning the first Author o

                   this changing of names, which litle importeth; certayne it is that M. Morton did falsely & maliciously abuse this iest of Polidore, or of whom soeuer it be, about naming Popes by Antiphrase.
                  A detectiō of M. Mortons lyes about this matter. Nor is he able to defend himselfe now, but rather as i
                     •
                   falleth out commonly in vntwisting of lies, he hath entangleth himselfe much more, or rather conuinced himselfe of open falsity. For first, he saith to his Maiesty, as now yow haue heard, that Polidore obserueth, that Popes for a long time in their election had their names changed by Antiphrase, viz. the elected if he were by naturall disposition fearfull, was named Leo, i
                        •
                     
                   cruell, Clemens, if vnciuill, Vrbanus, if wicked, Pius &c. But now by the latin words of Polidore brought in by M. Morton himself, it appeareth that he saith not so; to witt, that Popes for a long tyme had their names so changed by Antiphrase. Nay, he affirmeth it not of any one of all the whole ranke of Popes, but saith only (and in iest) that some might be so called by changing of names, not answerable to their dispositions.
               13. This then is the first inexcusable vntruth, wittingly and willingly auouched to the Kings Maiesty, and now againe auerred to the Honour of my Lord of Salisbury,
                  A wilfull vntruth vttered to the 
                        •
                     ing and to the L. of Salisbury.
                   to whome, notwithstanding,

he writeth in the Dedicatory Epistle of this Preamble, that he is content to vndergo all the crimes obiected against him, if it may be proued that he durst affirme an vntruth before his Lordship. But he that durst do it so confidently to the King, it may easely be presumed that he will dare it to the other also. And heere I must charge him to haue done it vnto them both, vntill he can defend himselfe.
               14. His second falshood was, the leauing out of those words of Polidore,
                  The secōd falshood in abusing of Polidore. 
                  (non extra iocum dictum sit,) let not this be spoken by vs (or be vnderstood to be spoken by vs) but in iest (or for a merriment:) wherby the writer would signify, that this pleasant conceipt came into his head, that by this changing of names, such an Antiphrase, or contrariety of names and dispositions might be practised: which wordes if M. Morton had related in his first quotation of Polidore, the matter had bin well qualified of it selfe. But this made not for his purpose, which was to scoffe at Popes, and make them contemptible by the help of Polidore. And I doubt not, but that this was the cause, why he quoted neyther booke nor Chapter in that allegation, least we should haue found out this which now himselfe is forced to produce to his owne shame and condemnation.
               15. But now perhaps the reader will demād what hath M. Morton answered to these two Chapters in this his Preamblatorie Reply?What M. Morton answereth to these two notorious lye
                        •
                      
                     Preamb. pag. 91. Hath he cleered himselfe of falshood? No, but rather doubled the same. For to the first this only he answereth: What haue I reported from Polidore? viz. that Popes names were changed by Antiphrase or contrary speach, to couer their defectes, & this is no whit differēt from the testimony of Polidore, who saith that if the Pope were before his creatiō
                   wicked, he did take the name

of Godly vpon him, if rigorous, then Gentle &c. This is his defence. But we haue shewed now the same to be false: and it is conuinced out of the foresaid latin wordes of Polidore, who saith only, that by the liberty of changing names, there may such Antiphrases be brought in: but saith not that it was practised in any one. Liceat mutare (saith he;) they may chāge their names if they will. This falshood then is doubled by himselfe, which is the first.
               16. The second is of concealing or leauing out deceiptfully in his fir
                     •
                  t citation, the wordes of Polidore (non extra iocum dictum sit) let it not be spoken but in iest: wher vnto here now he answereth nothing in effect, but first with this interrogation, Can this be ought but a transcendent impudency to blame me for not citing that testimony which his Pope, least it might be cited
                        •
                      hath vtterly razed out?
                  Two impertinent answers of M. Morton. But Syr, be more calme I pray yow, for you are not blamed for not cyting that which our Pope had commanded to be blotted out in our Copies, but for not cyting that which remayned in yours, & was willingly omitted by you (as now it appeareth) for that it made against you. This is then his first answere very cholerike as you see. His second is a certaine euasion by a sleightfull translation into English, wherby he seeketh to shift of the force therof, for thus he Englisheth it. As for example, saith he, (which may not be spoken without a iest) if peraduenture he had byn before a wicked man &c. which sleight euery man, that is but meanly learned in the latin tongue, will easely discouer. For that, non dictum sit cannot be fitly translated, it may not be spoken without a iest, but, let it not 
                        •
                     e spoken but in iest, wherin I remitt me to the sense of the text it self. So as about this second poynt M. Morton remayneth culpable two wayes, first in dissembling and suppressing this iest in his first booke, and now

in seeking to auoyd the same by sleightfull translation. But let both trickes go vnder one, and so I make it but one falshood, which laid to the other before, do make two notorious vntruthes, wherwith I do charge M. Morton now againe in this his last Reply, and say they are vnanswerable.
               17. As for that which he inveigheth against our Index expurgatorius, wherin he saith that our Popes doe, appoint what wordes shall be put out in mens bookes, as if they pulled out their tongues, least they should speake, it is not worth the answering. And I remember that I haue handled the matter els where against some of M. Mortons
                  
                     Warnword against Syr Franc. Hastings, enc. 2. cap. 9. nu. 22.23 &c.
                   fellowes. Good reasō, it must needs seeme in any reasonable mans iudgement, that such as professe themselues Catholiks, should be content, that if in any workes of theirs, any thing had escaped them, that eyther disagreed from the publike rule of faith, acknowledged by the whole Church, or were temerarious, scandalous, inconsiderate, or otherwise offensiue, should be censured and reformed by publike authority of the same Church. And he that hath not this humility and submission with him, is not worthy to be accompted a Catholike, or sonne of the Catholike Church.
               18. And as for others that are not Catholicks, they rather gayne heerby:How iust a thing it is that Catholike bookes should be ouerseene and corrected when need requireth. for that wheras their bookes that handle matters of religion, and are iudged to conteine inexcusable heresies, are wholy forbidden to be read by Catholiks, but with particuler licence: yet some other workes of theirs, that either treat not of that subiect, or do it so moderatly, as with paring and cutting of some exorbitant things that be most offensiue; they may be made tollerable, and are permitted to remayne to posterity: and all this by the benefitt of this Index expurgatorius, which otherwise should be

extermined with the rest, wherof almost infinite exāples may be seene in the Indices expurgatorij of euery Catholike Country, which permit bookes of hereticall Authors of all sorts,How bookes of Hereticall authours are permitted. to be read commonly and publikely after they haue byn censured and reviewed in this sort, which is not done by the Pope himselfe, or by his particuler order, in this or that place, as M. Morton would seeme fondly to perswade his Reader, when he saith, that Anno Domim 1572. by the Authority of Pius Quintus the foresaid wordes of Polidor were commanded to be blotted out: and againe, which his Pope (saith he) vtterly razed out &c. but the same is performed by a Congregation of learned men in euery Nation by commission of the said Church and Head therof.
               19. And I would demaund of M. Morton, or any indifferent man on his behalfe, if in England there were the like Congregation appointed of learned men to examine and censure bookes of their owne men, that are set forth, or after they be published, and are found to be so full of palpable vntruthes as these of his, and some other of his fellowes are, were it not a good prouidence, and more profitable both to their publike cause and priuate credit of the writers themselues,A demād made to M. Mort. about cē
                     suring of bookes. that some such reuiew should be made, than that euery man writing what he list without checke or controlement, do come after to shame their owne cause, by so many and manifest vntruthes laid open to the publike sight and laughter of the world, as in this and other bookes appeareth? But this point of prouidence concerneth not me, and I haue mentioned it only by inforcement of M. Mortons importunitie. Let vs passe to the sebond imputation.

                      fly. and hath so badly discharged, as you haue heard, with adding of new falshoods; he taketh the second out of the fourth Paragraph of my second Chapter of the said Treatise of Mitigation, where I hauing reprehēded him for false accusing of Pope Sixtus Quintus, that he censured the late K. Henry of France,
                  
                     Preamb. pag. 91.

                  Guise, I do passe on to tell him of another egregious falsity about the feigned death of our English Pope Adrian by a fly in these wordes.
               
                  The Charge.
                  21. And againe in the same place, or precedent page, he hath these words:
                        Mitig. p. 79. c. 2. num. 46. 
                     Pope Adrian being guilty of like sedi

                        ious practice against the Emperour Henry the second, was choked with a fly.

                           l. p. 1. gener. 39.
                     And in his quotation citeth Nauclerus for it, Generatione 139. which should be 39. for that Nauclerus hath nothing neere so many Generations in that part:Our English Pope Adr. egregiously abused by T. M. and insteed of Henry the second, he should haue said Fredericke the first of that name, for that Henry the second was before the time of our Conquest, and almost two hundred yeares before Adrian the 4. our English Pope, of whom we

now speake, who liued in the time of King Stephen, and King Henry the second of England, and was a holy man, and accompted the Apostle of Noruegia, for conuerting the same to our Christian faith, before he was Pope: and all Authors do write honourably of him, and so doth Nauclerus affirme; and therfore though he maketh mention of such a fable related by Vrspergensis that was a Schismaticall writer in those dayes (who also doth not absolutly auouch it, but with this temperament, vt 
                              •
                           ertur, as the report goeth) yet doth the sayd Nauclerus reiect the same as false, and confuteth it by the testimonies of all other writers, especially of Italy that liued with him, & therby knew best both his life, and death. And yet (said I) all this notwithstanding will this false ladde T. M. needes set downe this history as true, affirming it for such, and neuer so much as giuing his Reader to vnderstand, that any other denyed the same, or that the only Author himselfe of this fiction doubted therof. And is not this perfidious dealing? Or can any man excuse him from falshood and malice in this open treachery?
                  
               
               
                  The pretended discharge.
                  22. This was the Charge. What doth he now answere for the discharge of this imputation? First for a ground of euasion he saith, I do truly protest (for the man is euery where full of protestations) that I did not write this out o
                           •
                         the Author himselfe,
                     An absurd Confession. 
                     which I had neuer seene, but from collection out of some other bookes. So he. Which though it be a thing litle standing with his owne credit to confesse; yet in this protestation he must giue me leaue not easely to beleeue him, and this 
                        •
                     or two or three reasons.The first reason. First, for that he hath made many protestations in his former bookes to God, the King, the L. of Salisbury, and others of

true and sincere proceeding, and doth iterate the same heere againe in many places, and especially in the end of this Preamble, with great solemnity, vnder the names of new Chalenges, wherin notwithstanding I find him to haue practized the quite contrary to his protestations.
                  23. The second reason is,The second reason. for that it is not probable that he hauing to lay so great and greiuous an accusation vpon our English Pope Adrian, held by the Christ
                        •
                     an world of his tyme for a holy and renowned man, and this vpon the only testimony of Nauclerus, he would presume to do it, without looking vpon the Author himselfe: or if he did, it must needes argue him of great temerity, and of the same crime that heere he would auoyd, to wit, of falshood, and malice, and perfidious dealing.A comparison shewing vnconscionable dealing without regard of credit. For i
                        •
                      in England one should accuse another of murther or any other like greiuous crime, and that resolutly and affirmatiuely in publike iudgment (as this was presented by him to the Kings Maiestie of England, and to all Englishmen besides in a printed booke) and this only vpon hear-say, that some man had spoken it, and the man being in the Citty to be found out (as Nauclerus booke was in London) yet that he would not so much as seeke him out nor speake with him, but go presently to the Kinges Bench and accuse the other, and cause the arraignment to be made: and when the witnesse denied the same, he should excuse himselfe, saying, as M. Morton doth heere: It is true, and I do truly protest that I did neuer see the man, or speake with him, but framed my accusation vpon hear-say; were not this sufficiēt to condemne this man of falshood, and malice?
                  24. My third reason is, for that he set downe in the citation the very latin wordes themselues of

                     Nauclerus thus:The third reason. 
                     Hadrianus Pontifex excommunicationem Henrico secundo d

Adrian the Pope pronouncing excommunication against the Emperour Henry the second, himself being cursed by God, was choked with a flye. Which wordes are not to be found in Nauclerus, as heere they lye, nor yet in Vrspergensis, out of whom Nauclerus reciteth this fable,Many probabil
                           •
                        ties of false dealing. but his wordes are these: Cumque venisset ad quenda
                           •
                         fontem, ha

                        sit et bibit, ac continuò, vt fertur, musca os cius intrauit &c. And when as he came to a certaine well, he tooke water, and drunke it, and presently, as it is reported, a fly entred into his mouth, & could not be gotten forth vntill he died. So Vrspengensis, saith Naucl
                           •
                        rus. And then refuteth it both by the testimonies of all Italian writers which he could read, & of Iohn Salisburi
                           •
                        nsis (whome he calleth Falsboriensis) who was familiar with Adrian himself, and testified his vertues. And if M. Morton had not seene nor read Nauclerus (as heere to excuse himself he saith) how did he presume to sett downe his latin wordes so precisely, as his reader could haue noe probable cause to doubt, but that they were his owne proper wordes? VVas not this cra
                           •
                        tie perfidious dealing? So as to me it seemeth, that M. Morton by this first part of this euasion which consisteth in his protestation that he he had not seene, nor read the booke, doth more intangle himselfe in the crimes of falsity and malice, which he pretendeth to auoyd, then if he had simply confessed the same. But let vs see the other parts of his Answere.
                  
                     The second part of his answere.25 Secondly then he confesseth, that he erred in the misquotatiō of the Generatiō
                      cited out of Nauclerus, to wit, 139. for 39. and goeth about to proue that there was no malice therin, which I easily graunt, nor did I obiect it as any corruption,

but only aduised him of it as an errour. And therfore his long excuse of that matter,
                        Preamb. pag. 92. which was neuer vrged against him, sheweth that he seeketh occasions to intertaine himselfe, and to make a shew that he answereth somwhat, where in effect he saith nothing.
                  26. Thirdly, he confesseth that he should haue sayd Fredericke the first for Henry the second,The third part. against whome he accused Pope Adrian to haue moued sedition, and saith for his excuse: VVhat skilleth it whether it was Henry an Emperour, or Fredericke an Emperour that was excommunicated
                           •
                         wheras the intended conclusion was only this, that Adrian the Pope did excommunicate an Emperour, and conspired against him? But this now is not so tollerable as the former excuse, no nor tollerable at all in a learned man, especially in an accusation of so great weight, wherin the accuser ought to be exact, and precise. M. Morton saith it importeth no more, then in an examinatiō of a murther, whether the wound were giuen by the right hand or by the left: but 
                        •
                     e is deceiued, or would deceiue in this: For that error personae is of another māner of weight in such kind of accusatiōs then M. Mort. would seeme to make. For if Thomas Haruey (for example) should be accused to haue murthered secretly Henry Denham, and that Thomas Harueys friends could proue that Henry Denham was dead two hundred yeares before Tho. Haruey was borne (as Henry the second was very nere before Fredericke and Adrian) should this import no more, then whether Denham were slaine with the right or with the left hand of Haruey, wheras he could not be slaine by him at all? Heere then you see that matters are not exactly handled by M. Morton in this his false accusation of Pope Adrian.
                     The 4. part of his answere.
                  
                  27. Wherfore in the fourth place concerning the principall point it selfe of alleaging Nauclerus, as

a witnesse of the disastrous death of Pope Adrian by a fly, he answereth litle or nothing to the purpose, for excuse of his guilfull dealing therin, though he turne himselfe many waies to get out. He saith, that though Nauclerus doth not affirme it, yet Abbas Vrspergensis, related by Nauclerus, doth. But why had not M. Morton mentioned Vrspergensis at the firs
                        •
                     ? and sincerly haue told his Reader that he did only relate the matter with this clause (vt fertur) as it is said? Why, if he would haue dealt plainly, had he not confessed that Nauclerus did mislike and improue the said report, & that by the testimony of all Italian writers that he could read? Nay, why doth he now againe, being taken in flagrante delicto, misalleage Nauclerus words after that he had seene and read him, saying: Verùm cùm multi Itali nullam de hoc mentionem faciunt &c. but wheras many Italians do make no mention of this, wheras Nauclerus true words are: Verùm cùm Itali, quos legere potui, nullam de hoc faciant mentionem, & Ioannes Flasboriensis alij

                         multam de Adriano reserant honestatem &c. But wheras the Italian writers, which I could come to see, do make no mention of this matter, & Iohn of Salisbury and other Authors do relate much good of Adrian, &c.Many bad shifts of T. M. against Nauclerꝰ. 
                     Hae
                           •
                         et alia ambiguum me reddunt quid potiùs eligendum, quidùe credendum sit. Scribimus enim res gestas affectu nonnunquam plusquam veritatis amore ducti. Verùm vnum hoc adijcimus, Adrianū Virum

For that we do write other mens acts more oftentimes by affection, then led therunto by the loue of truth. VVhich wordes are euidently meant by Nauclerus, of Vrspergensis, taxing him that he wrote much of passion against Pope Adrian in behalfe of the Emperour Fredericke, with whome he held against the Pope, and

that do the next ensuing wordes of Nauclerus shew which are cut of by M. Morton in relating them here, in his Preamble, Ver

                     ity, for suffering them to dye disastrously, as this man would inferre of Popes. And finally how many Popes soeuer did dye vnfortunatly, this doth not excuse M. Morton in belying Adrian, and his Author Nauclerus, from which it seemeth that he cannot be excused.
                  29. And this in case all were true which he writeth of these other foure Popes, whom impertinently he bringeth in to accompany Adrian: but as in the one we haue found him manifestly false, so in these also you shall not find him exactly true, in any one thing lightly, that he saith of them, but still there must be some mixture of sleightfull tricks to disguise matters. And to help out the dye (to vse his owne phrase) he beginneth thus:
                        Preamb. pag. 94. 
                     But why should it be thought a matter incredible, that suth a dismall end should befall a Pope? Whervnto I answere that the question is not whether it be incredible, that a dismall end may befall a Pope, but whether such an end as yow describe, did befall Pope Adrian, or no? And whether you haue vsed true dealing in the manner of recounting the same?
                  
                     About Pope Anastasius the secōd his death.30. It followeth in your narration out of one of our Doctors (as you say:) Bene legitur Anastasium diuino nutu percussum interijsse: It is read that Pope Anastasius was stroken with the hand of God and perished, & you cite for it Ioannes de Turrecremata lib. de summa Eccles. de Anastasio. VVhich citation is so set downe, as I perswade my selfe,
                        Anno Domini 499. that at the next reply he will haue the like euasion as before in citing of Nauclerus, to witt, that he saw not the worke it selfe. For that Turrecremata doth not write only one booke de summa Eccles. as heere is insinuated, but foure, ech one of them hauing many chapters, and one only hath more then a hundred, which is this wherout this

                     ich allwayes you must imagin hath some mystery in it. He quoteth also de Anastasio, as though the Author had some such Chapter, wheras he only speaketh of this Pope Anastasius by way of answering certayne obiections about the cause of infallibility of not erring in the Bishop of Rome, when he is to decree any thing for the Church: wherabout some said, that albeit a Pope might fall into heresy, yet God would not permitt him to decree any thing hereticall, wherof an example was brought of this Pope Anastasius 2. that being inclined, as some thought, by instance of the hereticall Emperour (of his owne name) Anastasius then lyuing, to admitt vnto his communion the heretike Acatius, and expecting only for that purpose (as was thought) the returning of his legate Festus from Constantinople,

                           •
                        th the same thus: Any man may lawfully murder a Tyrant, which I defend (saith he) by common consent. But he that shall read the place in the Author himselfe, shall find that he houldeth the very contrary, to wit,A notable corruptiō about D. Boucher. that a priuate man may not kill a Tyrant, that is not first iudged and declared to be a publicke enemy by the common wealth. And he proueth the same at large, first out of Scriptures, & by the decree of the generall Councell of Constance: his wordes be these. Neque verò eo iure quod ad regnum,

habet, nisi per publicum Iudicium, spoliari potest &c. Neither can a tyrant be depriued of that right which he hath to a Kingdome, but only by publicke iudgmēt: yea further also so long as that right of kingdome remayneth, his person must be held for sacred, wherof ensueth, that no right remaineth to any priuate man against his life. And albeit any priuate man should bring forth neuer so many priuate iniuries done by the said Tyrant against him, as that he had whipped him with iron rodds, oppressed him, afflicted him, yet in this case must he haue patience,1. Pet. 2. according to the admonition of S. Peter: That we must be obedient not only vnto good and modest Lordes, but also vnto those, that be disorderly: and that this is grace when a man for Gods cause doth sustayne, and beare with patience iniuries vniustly done vnto him &c.
                     
                  
                  40. And in this sense (saith he) is the decree of the Councell of Constance to be vnderstood,

Thus writeth that Author, holding as you see, that no Tyrant whatsoeuer, though he be neuer so great a tyrant may be touched by any priuate man, for any priuate iniuryes though neuer so great, nor yet for publicke, though neuer so manifest, except he be first publickly condēned by the Commonwealth, which is an other manner of moderation and security for Princes, then the Protestant doctrine before rehearsed, and namely that of Knox vttered in the name of the whole Protestant congregation both of Scotland and Geneua:

                        If Princes be tyrants against God and his truth, his subiects are freed from their Oathes of Obedience.
                       So he.

Thus farre were my wordes of charge & reprehension to him in my former Treatise of Mitigation.
                     
                  
               
               
                  The pretended discharge.
                  42. And now you hauing heard this large Inditement, it is reason you heare also what the prisoner at the barre can bring forth for informing the Iury to his discharge. You must stand attent, for he would gladly slyde away, vnder a veile of wordes. Wherfore first he layeth forth at larg the drift of D. Bouchers discourse, saying that he maketh a double consideration of a Tyrant:A very pretty euasion of M. Mort. one, as he doth any iniury to any priuate man, and that for this he may not be slaine of a priuate man: the other, as he doth commit publicke iniurie and violence either in case of religion, or the ciuill state, and this Tyrant may be slaine by the common wealth; yea also and by any priuate man, when the common wealth hath declared him for a publicke enemy. And then he inferreth thus for himselfe: VVe see now that Boucher hath def
                           •
                        nded, both that no priuate man may kill a Tyrant for priuate iniuries done against priuate men, and also, that any

priuate man may kill a Tyrant for common iniuries. I haue alleaged the later, and P. R. hath opposed the former, both of vs haue affirmed a truth, where then is the falshood? Thus seeketh M. Morton to escape, and goeth about by two similitudes to confirme this manner of answering.
The first, that if an Esquire haue a sonne that is a knight, he shall sit aboue him in publike meetings, but not in priuate: that is, that he shall fit aboue him, and not sit aboue him, and so Christ commaunding (
                           •
                        aith he) that we should do as the Pharisies did ordaine, but not as they did in their lif
                           •
                         & manners: he willed vs to do, & not to do as the Pharisies do, in different respects and senses &c.
And thus thinketh to haue quitted himselfe learnedly by a distinction, for that as he saith the selfe same Tyrant may be killed, and not killed by a priuate man, in regard of publicke or priuate iniuries.
                  43. But this euasion is ouerthrowne by the words & whole discourse of Doctor Boucher now alledged,The ouerthrow of his euasion. for that he speaketh not only against killing a Tyrāt for priuate iniuries by a priuate man, but also in publicke iniuries: for so doth shew his allegation of the Decree of the Councell of Constance that condemned as an errour in faith to hold with Iohn VVickcliffe, that euery Tyrant may be slayne meritoriously by any vassall or subiect of his, by open or secret treasons, which is vnderstood, as well for publicke as priuate iniuries.
                  44. But it is graunted by D. Boucher, saith M. Morton, that when the common wealth hath condemned and declared any Tyrant for a publick enemy, he may be slaine by a priuate man. Wherto I answere, that then he is no priuate man, for that he doth it by a publike authority of the Common Wealth, as doth the ex

                     cutioner, that cutteth of a Noble mans head, by order and authority of the publicke Magistrate: so

                        •
                     ueth him to no purpose, for that neither for priuate or publicke iniuries can a priuate man, as a priuate man, that is to say, by priuate authoritie kill any Prince though he were a Tyrant for any cause either priuate or publicke whatsoeuer. So as in this principall charge M. Morton remaineth wholy conuicted as you see.
                  45. There do rest the two other wings of falshod obiected vnto him:M. Mort. condemned in the principall. the first, that he stroke out the wordes of most importance frō 
                     D. Bouchers discourse, which made the matter cleare, to wit, quem hostem Respublica iudicauerit, whome the Common-wealth hath adiudged for a publicke enemie, him may a priuate man kill: and the second, that he addeth the other clause of his owne that are not found in Bouchers wordes, VVhich I say by common consent. The first of these two falshoods he would excuse by saying, that albeit that D. Boucher in the place before alleadged, out of his third booke, doth set downe this position with the foresaid restriction, priuato etiam cuiuis Tyrannum quem hostem Respub. iudicauerit, occidere licitum esse: that it is lawfull also to any priuate man to kill a Tyrant,Two accessoryes. whome the Commonwealth hath iudged for a publike enemy, (for then he doth it not by priuate authority:) yet that in his fourth booke he hath a whole Chapter to proue, that in some vrgent cause the matter may be preuented, as when the thing is so notorious, instant, and perilous, as the said publicke iudgement cannot well be expected, and may be presumed, as graunted, especially (saith he) in po
                           •
                        na priuatiua in priuatiue punishment, that is to say, when subiects in punishmēt of open and manifest tyranny do withdraw their due respect and obedience, by seeking only to defend themselues: though not in positiua, in positiue punishment of actuall rebellion or warre offensiue. But

this doth not any way satisfy the falshood obiected in striking out thes
                        •
                      wordes in the former booke & place, where D. Boucher set them downe for declaration of this doctrine, that a priuate man was not licenced to kill a Tyrant by his owne priuate authority: for when Subiects are forced to vse this way of preuention by armes defensiue, before the common-wealth can make publicke declaration; in such cause they do it not, as priuate men, but as the body of the Common-wealth: So as considering what heere is in question, he must needs be condemned of a nihil dicit, if not also of 
                        
                           •

                  46. And the very like may be said about the second accessory vntruth, for adding the wordes (which I say by common consent,) for excuse wherof he runneth to the other Chapters wherin he saith that D. Boucher auoucheth, Mirum esse in affirmand
                           •
                         consensū, there is wōderfull cōsent in allowing this doctrine, and then in another Chapter, that he who denieth this (that he sayth) is destitute of common sense: But these are of other matters and spoken vpon other occasiōs and not annexed to the former sentence of D. Boucher,
                     The secōd Accessory. produced and corrupted by M. Morton, and consequently they are mere impertinent euasions, that do more confirme and establish, then any way remoue the fraudes and falshoods obiected against him. And so much of this matter, which would grow ouer long, if we should prosecute the same, as M. Mortons manner of answere would inuite vs.
               
            
            
               
               THE FOVRTH Charge of falshood pretended to be answered or rather shifted of by M. Morton, and cast vpon R. C. §. IIII.
               AMONG other examples that I alleaged of M.  Mortons spirit in dealing vnsincerely by calumniating our Catholicke writers, therby to get some shew of aduantage against them, and the Catholick cause, I produced a place out of M. VVilliam Reynolds his booke de Reipublicae authoritate,
                  About the abuse of M. VVilliam Reinolds most notoriously abused and peruerted to make him seeme to abase the authority of Kings, and Princes in that very place where M. Reynolds did specially imploy himselfe in aduancing their dignity: I shall heere lay forth the fraude; you shall iudge what manner of consciences these men haue, and whether they defend their cause as a cause of truth or no. This then was my former reprehēsion about his dealing in this point.

                        or that the latin hath no such aduersatiue clause as, but, nor, creation, but rather the

word constitution. Secondly these words are not the words of M. Reynolds, but only cited by him out of S. Peter, and thirdly they are alleaged heere by Thomas Morton to a quitte contrary sense from the whole discourse and meaning of the Author, which was to exalt and magnify the Authority of Princes, as descending from God, and not to debase the same as M. Reynolds is calumniated to say. For proofe heerof whosoeuer will looke vpon the booke and place it selfe before mentioned, shall fynd that M. Reynolds purpose therin is,M. Reynolds discourse. to proue, that albeit earthly Principality, power and authority be called by the Apostle, humana creatura: yet that it is originally from God, and by his commandement to be obeied. His words are these: Hinc enimest &c. Hence it is, that albeit the Apostle do call all earthly principality a humane creature, for that it is placed in certayne men (from the beginning) by suffrages of the people: yet election of Princes doth flow from the law of Nature, which God created, and from the vse of reason,
                           Rom. 13. which God powred into man, and which is a litle beame of diuine light drawne from that infinite brightnes of Almighty God: therfore doth the Apostle S. Paul pronounce, that there is no power but from God, and that he which resisteth this povver resisteth God himsel

                  49. In which wordes we see that M. Renoyldes is so farre of from debasing Kings in this his discourse or subiecting them vnto the people, as he doth both extoll & magnifie their dignity, as proceeding frō God himselfe, and reconcileth togeather the speach of P. Peter, calling a King a humane creature, with the wordes of S. Paul, pronouncing it to be of God, and vnder payne of damnation to be obeyed. And can there be any more vntrue dealing then this? Let vs see then how M. Morton will heere discharge himselfe: you shall

see him somwhat more humiliated then before (would God to his conuersion, and not to his greater obduration and confusion:) and yet will he in any case defend & not amēd his error: for thus he procedeth.

                           Pag. 100.50 This Allegation is (saith he) of all which yet I haue foūd most obnoxious, and alliable vnto taxation; which (God knoweth that I lye not) I receiued frō suggestion, as the Author therof R. C. can witnesse. For at that time I had not that Rosaeus, aliâs Reynolds, neither by that present importunity of occasions could seeke after him, which I confesse, is greatly exorbitant: for I receiued it as a testimony debasing the authority of Kings.
So he. And truly when first I read the beginning of this answere, and heard him so earnestly, and solemnly to protest before God that he receyued this fraud against M. Reynolds by suggestion, I imagined he would haue said of the Diuell, for that he cōmonly is the proper suggestour of all such vniust and wicked calumniations: but when I saw the letters of R. C. follow insteed of the Diuell, I began to muse and thinke with my selfe whether there were any Diuell of that name or no,A strange euasion of M. Mort. by accusing R.C. or if it were no Diuell himself, what instrument or chosen seruant of Sathan it might be, that had made this false suggestion, which M. Morton himselfe confesseth heere to be greatly exorbitant from the truth, and insteed of one thing to haue suggested the quite contrary, & that wittingly against his conscience; yea with a double malice as may seeme. The first to calumniat

                     M. Reynolds, and Catholike doctrine by him: and the other to disgrace M. Morton, by making him put in print so notorious a lye and corruption.
                  
                     51. But when afterwards I was aduertised by some that would seeme to know the mistery, that R. C. did signify Ri. Can. I was driuen into a farre greater me
                        •
                     uaile, how M. Morton could be permitted to publish such a matter in print (the thing hauing to pas
                        •
                     e the view of R.C. his officers) and how he could presume to haue more care of his owne credit, then of the others that is his head and Chiefteyne? For as a scarre the more higher it standeth in the forhead, the more deformity it worketh to the whole body: so such a notorious cryme of wilfull falsification being proued to be in the Head it self, euen by the asseueration and testimony of so principall a member of the same Head, cannot be but very disgracefull to the whole body: though it may be that M. Morton being the party most interessed, might pretend in this, not only his owne personall defence, in this particuler escape, but a protection also more generall heerby for all Ministers to vse this art with lesse reprehension, when the Head of Ministers should be conuinced to vse the same with such liberty and lacke of conscience, especially in a matter so odious, preiudicious and calumnious to all the ranke of Catholiks. I do confesse (saith M. Morton) that it is greatly exorbitant, for I receyued it as a testimony debasing the authority of Kings. And from whome? From R. C. But did he gather it himselfe (thinke you) or did he take it also by tradition of others & vpon credit as you professe your selfe to haue donne? The later were disgracefull: the first hatefull. For if he looked vpon the Authour himselfe he must needs see, that M. Reynolds drift was to aduance Kingly authority, and not to debase it: and therfore for R. C, to sett downe the quite cō
                     trary, and make another to print it also with his allowance and approbation, was a double or triple

iniquity. And surely if the like may be proued in any Prelate of ours, let him haue for pennance neuer to be trusted after,A moderate satisfaction demaunded for a great crime. which is the greatest satisfaction that I would wish to be exacted of R. C, if he acknowledge this accusation of M. Morton for true.
                  52. But now, though this charging of R. C. be some disburdening to T. M. that he inuented not the slaunder of himselfe: yet doth it not wholy free him frō all falshood in the matter. For he should not haue yealded to the false suggestion, nor

                      admitted so vniust a temptation: for supposing that R. C. would needes play the part of the tempting and lying serpent, yet ought T. M. not to haue followed the frailty of the credulous & infirme womā: & although R. C. had deliuered vnto him the note so ba

                     ely, as he puteth it downe, out of M. Reynolds, to wit, Rex humana creatura est, quia ab hominilus cōstituta: yet could not M. Morton but remember, that the effect therof was in the Epistle of S. Peter, and that in no sense it could be truly Englished as he doth, A King is but a creature of mans creation:The word (but) maliciously inserted. both for that the word (but) which is a particle aduersatiue or exclusiue, is not to be found in the latin wordes of M. Reynolds: nor could it stand in any reasonable good meaning, that a Kings authority is nothing els but a humayne creature, as though it had no dependance or causation from God. Wherfore as there was great malice in the suggestor of this false imputation: so was there no lesse want of truth in him that so willingly yealded to so bad and false a suggestion. But what saith he heere for his defence? This which now ensueth.
                  
                     
                        
                           Preamb. pag. 100.53. Vpon this presumption, saith he, (if true,) (to wit, that M. Reynolds had spoken to the debasemēt of Kings authority as he did not, but to the contrary) it could be no falshood in me, to insert the particle (but,) especially

being acquainted with the doctrine of Cardinall Bellarmine, who that he may disable the authority of a King in comparisō of the dignity of a Pope, doth defend, 
                           •
                        hat Kings, being chosen by men, are not immediatly created by God: and yet, the Pope elected by Cardinalls, hath his authority immediatly from God.
                     
                  
                  54. Wherto I answere, that well he might say so, for that Christ both God and man did institute in particuler, and immediatly the Supreme Authority of S. Peter, and his successors, when he gaue to him, and by him to them the keyes of heauen, but he i
                        •
                     stituted not the Authority of Kings immediatly, but left to each people to be gouerned by what sort of gouernment they best liked:How the authority of Kings is from God and how from man. albeit, that where that forme of gouernment, or any other (as of Dukes, Common-wealth, or the like) was once lawfully introduced, he commanded due obedience to be performed therūto. So as though we may truly say, that Kingly Authority is immediatly but from man; yet can we not say, that a King is but a creature o
                           •
                         mans creation, for that this includeth both immediatly and mediatly, which is false: For that kingly Authority is the creature of God mediatly and originally; for that God giueth power to the people to chuse him, with commandement to obey him when he is chosen, and it is the creature of man immediatly, for that by choice of men that dignity is appointed in some Coūtries, and not in other, which is not so in the Popes, and their Authority. For though their persons be chosen immediatly by Cardinalls, that are men, as here M. Morton obiecteth: yet is not their office, power or authority chosen or appointed by those men as in Kinges, but immediatly by God. So as this hole will not serue M. Morton to runne out at, or to excuse his fraudulent thrusting in of the word (but) that peruerted the whole sentence of his aduersary.
                  
                     55. And yet is it further to be considered by the Reader
                        •
                      that all which heere he hath said for his excuse therin, is but vpon a supposition, that this sentence in M. Reynolds did tend to the abasing of Kings Authority: which suppositiō being t

                     alse. For that albeit we admit the supposition to be true, that M. Reynolds intention was in that place,The particle (b

                      and the other mediatly only: yet that the sentence of S. Peter could not admit the inserting of the particle (but) without falshood.
                  56. But now this supposition is not true but false that M. Reynolds pretended that, in the place alleaged, but the quite contrary, as was deliuered in my reprehension: and M. Morton hauing seene the place before the making of this his last Reply, & therupon made his protestation which you heard, saying, God knoweth that I lye not, but receiued it from suggestion of R. C

                      yet this notwithstanding he maketh all his defence out of a supposed presumption, saying: If it be true (sayth he) then it could be no falshood in me: but now being proued and graunted not to be true, it must needes follow that it was a falshood in him. And this is the substantiall manner of clearing himselfe.
                  57. Lastly he frameth to himselfe an obiection, & seeketh to intertaine time by answering the same to no purpose in the world, for thus he saith.An obiectiō made by himself, which he is not able to solue. 
                     I know that P. R. may possibly insist, that he cited the text o

Reynolds, which are warrantable by S. Peter? This is his obiection, which indeed hath no solution: for that the wordes being

taken out of S. Peter, and vsed by M. Reynolds in S. Peters sense, and to

                  58. But to this M. Morton answereth, that the selfe same sentence may be vsed by diuers in seuerall senses, laudably in the one, and reprehensibly in the other,
                        Matth. 16. as haile Maister was to Christ by the Disciples, and by the Pharisies, and,
                        Marc. 5. 
                     thou art the Sonne of God by S. Peter, and by the Diuell, & so it might haue bene presumed (saith M. Morton) that M. Reynolds vsed S. Peters wordes, but not in S. Peters sense. And let the Reader obserue that he saith that it might haue be
                        •
                     ne presumed, to wit, when R. C. did falsely suggest it so, but now that M. Morton hath seene, and read the place both in my reprehension heere set downe, & in M. Reynolds himselfe, and hath found that he vsed this place in the very sense of S. Peter for exalting the Kings authoritie; yea in the sense of M. Morton here set downe, saying: Let euery Christian learne that, that Gouernour whome S. Peter calleth a creature of man, S. Paul calleth the Ordinance of God. If this I say be so, how can M. Morton excuse himselfe from a grosse malicious falshood,Diuers shiftes to get out. in that he obiected this sentence in his Discouery against M. Reynolds, as though therby he had debased Princes Authority? Heare I pray yow his last shift. Though not the place alleaged (saith he) yet the scope of M. Reynolds whole booke doth conuince him of rebellious doctrine, as will more plainly appeare in the Encoū
                        ter. Marke now whither he is fled. He confesseth, that in the place alleadged by M. Reynolds (wherabout only standeth our controuersy) his dri

consequently he must graunt, that he abused him in that crimination. But he saith, that the scope of his Booke is otherwise, which he deferreth to proue vntill he make his larger Encounter, which I suppose will require a large tyme: and in the meane space we haue both by our euiction and his owne confession, that he be

C. purposed to incense by this their false cōspiracy against vs, and our whole cause, vsing such inuentions of their owne for our assertions; then which manner of proceeding nothing can be more malicious or wicked.

               THE FIFTH Imputation of lying pretended to be answered by M. Morton, or rather by M. Stocke for him. §. V.
               
                   NEXT vnto this M. Mort. culleth out of my book some dozen pages after the former,About the decree of Gratian wrōgfully alledged. an imputation of false dealing about certaine places cited out of the Canon law. My reprehension of his said false dealing is set downe in these wordes.
But will you heare a case or two more out of the Canō
                     
law, how dextrous Syr Thomas is in corrupting that which he loueth not,
                        Mitig. pag. 82. nor seemeth well to vnderstand? You may read in the fourth page of his pamphlet an ancient decree (for so he calleth it) alleaged by him out of Gratian in the Glosse, determining, that though a man hath sworne to pay money to one that is excōmunicated,Another Cosenage about a text of Gratian. yet is he not bound to pay the same, & he alleageth the latin text thus: Si iuraui me soluturum alicui pecuniā qui excōmunicatur, non 
                           •
                        eneor ei soluere: If I haue sworne to pay money to any mā that is excommunicated, I am not bound to pay it, adding this reason, quia qualiter cumque possumus, debemus vexare malos, vt cessent à malo: We ought to vexe euill men by what meanes soeuer we may to the end they may cease from doing euill. In the allegation of which little text a man would hardly belieue how many false tricks there be to make Catholicke doctrine to seeme odious and absurd.

                  60. But the truth is that the wordes of the Glosse cōteyne only a certaine obiection, vpon a clause of a Canon, cōcerning promise to be obserued to one that is exōmunicated, after the promise was made:A doubt proposed & solued. and the obiection or doubt is made in these wordes by the Author of the Glosse or Commentary: Sed quid dices, si iuraui &c. But what will you say, if I haue sworne to pay money to any persō, or haue promised the same vnder some forfeiture, and in the meane space, he, to whom I made the promise, is excommunicated, am I bound to pay the same or not? This is the question: and then he argueth on both

sides, and first for the negatiue, Vi

And the very like doth our Minister heere, calling this obiection of Videtur quòd non, not only a resolution but an ancient Decree. Secondly, there is willfull deceipt in leauing out the first wordes of the Author, Sed quòd dices, si iuraui? But what will you say, if I haue sworne? which doe plainly shew that it is but an obiectiō. Thirdly that he alledgeth the reason of the obiection,Foure fal

this not as a priuate opinion, but as an ancient decree of the law and Canon it selfe. Consider I pray you how many fraudes and falshoodes there be in one litle quotation, and what a volume I should be in

I am glad to see in the mingling of a poūd of worme-wood, and ten ounces of gall, he had the grace to let fall this drame of sugar, and that so seasonably. For the truth is, that I tooke vp these allegations of Gratian vpon credit, & therfore returne these peeces vnto him, of whome I receiu

Morton is to be a publike writer, when so often he is forced either to cōfesse that he neuer saw the Authors which he citeth, or that he tooke them vp by credit or borrowing of others: we may see also how poore men in substance our Ministers are, who for some shew of defence of their bad cause, and for some ostētation or rather calumniation against Catholicks they ioine their labours togeather like emmitts, the one to carry straw, the other earth, the other some more contemptible matter to make a cō

               64. Now then finding himselfe pressed in such so
                     •
                  t as he cannot tell which way to turne for defending his credit, he is forced to make recourse to stockes aud stones, blockes and bones, (as their phrase is, of our recourse to intercession of Saints and honouring of their reliques) that is to say, he is constrained to referre vs ouer to one M. Richard Stocke a brother-Minister of his, and digni
                     •
                  ied by him in the margent with the title of a learned Preacher of London. This Stocke then being a bad storehouse of such as write against vs to furnish them with false wares, lent M. Morton the places, or rather deceaued & abused him with them, as Ri. Can. did before, which Stocke acknowledgeth the matters & beginneth his recognisance thus: I Richard Stocke brought this allegation with some others to the Author of the Discouery &c. And can there be any thing more ridiculous then this, when one Minister is brought in to help out another in matter of false dealing. If I would bring in a Colloquium here betweene M. Morton and M. Stock about the defence of this place for sauing mutually their honesties, should I not haue other manner of

matter for an interlude the M. Morton framed to himselfe before out of his fingers ends betweene the Moderate Answerer,
                     Supra. c. 2. and the Mitigator.
               65. But I meane not to spend time in such trifles: only I would haue the iudicious Reader in earnest to consider, that if M. Morton either of himselfe or with the help of his creditor M. Stocke, that lent him the falsified authorities before alleadged against Catholickes, could any way in the world with any probable shift haue answered the said falsities himselfe though neuer so slenderly; it may be presumed that for his credits sake he would haue done it rather in his owne name, then haue confessed his pouerty, or rather patchery in borrowing it of another, and much lesse would he haue sent vs to M. Stocke for answere therof,The conference betweene M. Stocke and M. Morton, for diuiding the shame of falsifying. but rather would he haue taken Stockes direction, & haue deliuered the same as frō himselfe, if any way he had foūd it to be sufficiēt for some probability of truth? But indeed they cōferring matters togeather, and examining the places, and finding that they were both of them taken in a false measure, the one for lending the false authority, the other for borrowing and abusing; they concluded like good fellowes & frends to deuide the shame betweene them, M. Morton for his beggarly borrowing and deceiptfull vsage of that which he had borrowed, and M. Stocke for his fraudulent lending of that which was not true, nor verifiable.
               66. Let vs come then to the tryall how both ioyning togeather, do indeauour ech one for his part to satisfie my former charge. There be foure or fiue points of falsity obiected to them as you haue heard. The first, that M. Morton in his Discouery auerred (& repeated the same afterward againe in his full Satisfaction) that it is an ancient decree of the Canon

law, that Catholickes are not bound to pay debts vnto hereticall creditors, notwithstanding they haue sworne to do it. And for this he citeth thus:

                   &c. but so fraudulently patched togeather by M. Morton, or by his Creditor M. Stocke, as where the said wordes lye not togeather, nor are spoken by the Glosse to one purpose but to quite contrary and opposite senses, M. Morton alleadged them as appertaining to one & the same effect: the wordes are before set downe: Si iuraui me soluturum &c. and the different fraudes and falsities therin vsed haue byn before displayed. Now only we must see how M. Stocke (the Champion or vndertaker) can defend himselfe about the first point, whether there be an ancient decree or no, for not paying debts to excommunicate persons, which both he, and his borrower M. Morton are bound to bring forth vnder paine of discredit, for that the wordes of any Glosse do not proue a Canonicall decree, nor do these heere alleadged, Si iuraui me soluturū, make to that purpose but expresly to the cōtrary that a man is bound to pay, as hath bene declared. How then are these two first pointes answered of falsifying a decree, and peruerting the Glos
                     •
                  e? Let vs heare the new aduocate M. Stocke speake for himselfe.
               
                  67. This allegation (saith he) with some others, I Richard Stocke brought vnto the Author of the Discouery, which P. R. challengeth to be maliciously cited,
                     
                        Pream p. 104. M Stocks defence. 
                     partly for that the wordes of the Glosse were only set downe, when the decree is mentioned, wherin I conceiue P. R. complayneth no otherwise, then one, who being smitten with the scabbard, should complayne that he was not strucke with the sword: So he, because T. M. talked of the decree, and vrged only the Glosse.
                  
For the decree is farre more playne against

them then the Glosse.

                           que
                         ipsi ad satisfactionem veniant. This is the Decree, which in the generall carrieth as much or more, as is set downe by him, and so cleareth him from any malice in this point. So M. Stocke.
                  
               
               68. But as for malice, we shall treat afterwards. Now wee are to see how he hath beaten vs with both the sword & scabbard, that is, both with the Canon or Decree it selfe of Gregory the 7. Nos Sanctorum: as also with the scabbard, which is the Glosse vpon that Canon: and for this later we haue proued before, that being peruerted & manifestly corrupted by M. Morton, quite contrary to the sense, wordes, and meaning of the writer, who saith, and proueth the quite opposite to that which he was made say by M. Morton: though it be but a scabbard; yet hath it wounded and broken M. Mortons head, and M. Stockes also, if he had part in the corrupting therof.
               69. As for the sword it selfe which is the Canon Nos Sanctorum heere alleaged,The sword & scabbard both wounding M. Mortons cause. M. Stocke himselfe confesseth, that it striketh not vs in particuler in determining any thing about or against paying of debts to excommunicate people, and therfore he maketh his inference thus: This is the Decree which in the generall carrieth as much or more as is set downe. Marke that he saith, that it carrieth as much in generall: but generalities are not sufficient to auouch particulers. This Canon doth prohibite obedience to be exhibited to excommunicate persons vntill they do conforme thē
                  selues: it speaketh nothing of debts: how shall we try it? First by the wordes themselues, wherin there

is no mention at all of debts: and for that cause it is probable that M. Stocke was ashamed to English them, as M. Morton before to recite them. Secondly by the Cōmentary or Glosse, whose wordes are plaine Licèt excommunicatio tollat obligationem quoad 
                        ••••

                     •
                  e expound the Canon, and the scabbard doth agree with the sword, and both of them do hurt M. Mortō
                   & M. Stocke, though neuer so good fencers in a bad cause.
               70. After this M. Stocke, to helpe out somwhat his Client M. Morton, telleth vs that the selfe same Glos
                     •
                  e (that after disputing to and fro, concluded before for vs, as we haue seene, that we are bound to pay debts to excommunicate persons) granteth notwithstanding in the end, that probabiliter dici potest &c. probably, notwithstanding, it may be said that by excōmunication of the person a man is excused from paying debts vnto him in respect of the sundry authorities and reasons that he had recited for that opiniō before: but what of this? We know his owne resolution before was, Verius credo &c. I do thinke the truer opinion to be, that we are boūd to pay, though this other be not improbable also for the reasons alleaged: what maketh this for the excuse of M. Morton that alleaged this Glosse, as holding the quite contrary.
               71. M Stocke goeth further to alleage another begining of a Canō, Absolutos se nouerint, which was made by Pope Gregory the 9. almost two hundred yeares after the former,
                     Greg. 9. decret. l. 5. tit. 7. c. 16. wherin the very same thing is decreed as in the other, to wit, that he who falleth

                  , which is of Bernardus de Buttono Parmensis, doth probably hold, that to such a man there is not obligation of payment of debt (at leastwise of such debts as are only contracted by promises, but are not reall debts) so long as he remayneth in that case.
                     Tolet. lib. 1. Instruc. cap. 13. §. Sextus. And to this effect also speaketh Tolet in the place heere cited by M. Morton, and we haue heard before, how the other Glosse of Bartholomaeus Brixiensis held it for probable, though the contrary for more true, vpon the Canon Nos Sanctorum.
               
               72. Wherfore to conclude, we see that neyther M. Mort. nor his new Aduocate M. Stocke, nor both of them together haue beene able to bring forth the ancient decree which was promised about not paying of debts due to Protestants (for this he would inferre to make our doctrine more odious vnto thē) for besides that Protestants are not nominatim excommunicati, and cōsequently not comprehended in the cases alleaged, the two decrees mentioned, do speake only of temporall seruice and obedience, and secondly the Glosse, alleaged and corrupted by M. Morton and M. Stocke both in wordes and sence is not heere iustified nor defēded at all, according to their former allegation therof, but that the foure abuses obiected by me out of the same, remaine still lyable vpō them, as if they had answered nothing at all, so valiāt vndertakers haue they shewed themselues, and stout Champions. Let vs passe vnto another no better defended by them then this.

Thus then I wrote before.

                           Mit. p. 84.74. In the sixt page (quoth I) of his Discouery he hath this grieuous accusation out of the Canon law against vs: Haeretici filij, vel consanguinei non dicuntur, sed iuxta legem sit manus tua super eos, vt fundas sanguinem ipsorū. And then he quoteth thus, apud Grat. gloss. in decret. lib. 5. Ex decret. Greg. 9. caus. 23. q. 8. cap. Legi. which distracted kind of quotation separating the first and last wordes that should haue gone togeather, seeme to import that he scarce read the bookes thēselues, but cited the same out of some other mans notes. But that fault were easely pardoned, if he vsed no greater fraud in the thing it selfe. For first he Englisheth the words thus, Heretickes may not be termed eyther children or kindred, but according to the old law thy hand must be against them to spill their bloud, and then in the margent he setteth downe this speciall printed note, The professed bloudy massacre against the Protestants

without distinction of sex or kindred. And what can be more odiously vrged then this? Now thē let vs see how many false trickes and shiftes, fit for a Protestant Minister, do lye lurcking in this short citation.

For first he corrupteth the words of the Glosse apparantly, and that in diuers poynts, leauing out that which the Glosse saith, and adding that which the Glosse hath not; then he corrupteth the meaning both of Glosse and Canon, deprauing that to a wicked sense of bloudy massacring without distinction of sex or kindred; which the Canon and Councell of Carthage, with S. Augustine, meant only of ciuill punishmēt against heretickes, to wit, that they could not be made heires to Ecclesiasticall men. Thirdly he peruerteth in like manner S. Hieromes intent, which was, that albeit he wished that heretiks should be punished also bodily, yet by order and forme of law, and not that any one should kill another, and much lesse by

VVherto I answere, that the demand is foolish, and not worthy the answering at all: for that the like odious demandes may be made about the execution of all criminall lawes. And it is a token that M. Morton is at a Non-plus, when he seeketh to intertayne tyme in these impertinences.

But now he pretermitting all the other three points, taketh vpon him only to write some few lynes in defence of this fourth and last poynt about spilling of bloud,Whether spilling & shedding of bloud be all one. going about to shew out of diuers places of the Rhemish Translation of the new Testament, that not only spilling of bloud, but shedding of bloud also is somtimes taken in ill part,

Morton, if passion against the Popes Canon had not letted him, would neuer haue translated the wordes of God sundere sanguinē, to spill bloud, which alwaies is takē in the worst sense, but rather shedd bloud, that may haue a good sense.

So farre M. Morton in his choller. And now all this (as you see) requireth no answere, but compassion rather towards the party, so pittifully put out of tune by the weaknes of his cause, as he is forced to draw

vs to an Ale-house for ending therof. But let him proue by any of his Ale-wiues, that spilling of good ale is takē in good

But what need more testimonies when the thing is cleerly extant in the Councell of Carthage it selfe,A shamefull denying of a Canon in the third Councell of Carthage. where it is written in the 13.

of the third Carthage Councell, hath this Canon:

               THE SEAVENTH Imputation of falshood pretended to be answered by M. Morton. §. VII.
               
                   THE Reader cannot forget how that in the beginning of this Chapter M. Morton protested that he had not chosen out those imputatiōs which were most easie to be answered,About the Extrauagant for the Glosse but such rather, as his Aduersary did most insist and insult vpon. Now he layeth further forth against me, that I do charge him with falshood about alleadging an  Extrauagant of the Pope insteed of a Glosse, and that after my whole charge giuen, I do insult in these words: Thus much

Morton intituleth them, to wit, Popish Arguments from Reason. And to the end you may see his talent therin, we shall examine only the third reason in this place, which he declareth in these words: Except (saith the Romish pretence) there were a way of deposing Apostata Princes, God had not prouided sufficiently 
                              •
                           or his Church. And for this he citeth the Constitution Extrauagant of Pope Boni

But as in all his other citations generally he is neuer lightly true, and sincere in all poynts, no not thrice (I thinke verily) throughout all this lying Booke of his: so neyther heere. And it would require a great volume alone to examine only some part of his leaues about this point of his shifts & corruptions, they are so many, and thicke, & craftily hudled vp togeather. As for example heere, first this sentence is not in the Popes Extrauagant at all, but only in a certayne addition to the ordinary Glosse, or Commentary of Iohn Picard,
                        Extrauagant of Bonifa. 8. falsly alleaged. which addition was made by Petrus Bertrandus a late writer. Secondly this Commentary saith nothing of deposing Apostata Princes, but only affirming the foresaid opinion of Canonists to be true, that Christ was Lord absolutely in this life ouer all, not only in spirituall authority, but in temporall also, he inferreth therby, Christ should not haue sufficiently prouided for the gouernment of his Church, and Kingdome vpon earth, Nisi vnicum post se talem Vicarium reliquisset, qui haec omnia posset, except he had left

some such one Substitute or Vicar after him, as should be able to performe all these things,

                         to wit, as belong both to spirituall & temporall power, according as necessity shall require, which later clause you see, that T.M. cut of, as he added the other about Apostata Princes. And thus much for his variety of corruptions in this litle sentence.

                  89. We see the points of iugglings heere obiected, let vs also see how sincerly they will be now answered by M. Morton in this his last Reply. First he sayd in his Booke of Full Satisfaction, that the sentence by him proposed, was in the Popes Extrauagants, or Extrauagant Constitutions: now it is shewed that they are not found in any Extrauagant Constitution at all, but only in a certayne addition of one Petrus Bertrandus a late writer vpon the Glosse or Commentary what answereth he to this? For cityng (saith he) the Extrauagants of the Pope,

                     an ingenious Reader would haue vnderstood a figure called Synecdoche, where the part is put for the whole: as when we say, This man shall not come vnder my roofe, meaning by roofe, which is

                  90. This is the first part of his answere, that we must vnderstād him by a figure,A ridiculous answere by a figure. 
                     Pars pro toto, as if a man should say in diuinity, the Scripture hath this or that, because some that write Commentaryes or Annotations vpon it haue it: so as all Commentaryes must be held for Scriptures. And the like in Philosophy, Aristotle may be affirmed to say this or that, for that some of his Expositours doe say the same. VVere not this a substantiall kind of arguing ou

                      of the figure Synecdoche, which is Pars pro toto, a part for

the whole? Will not M. Morton be ashamed of this shift, and blush at the consequence? But indeed here is not so much as any Synecdoche, or such figure at all, but only the figure of playne lying. For neyther are the Extrauagant Constitutions of Popes, partes of the 
                        •
                     losses, nor the Glosses are parts of the Constitutions, & much lesse may Additions or Annotatiōs be accompted any partes at all of the same: So as heere M. Morton cannot be defended or excused by his Synecdoche in cyting an Annotation for an Extrauagant Decree, or Papall Cōstitution. And this is his first shift: let vs see his second.
                  91. The second is not so fyne, but much more soule and 
                        •
                     raudulent, or rather shameles, which he deliuereth in these wordes, therby to proue that Glosses and Annotations are not only partes of the Popes Constitutions, but of the very same Authority and validity with them: a strange desperate assertion, if you consider it well. But how will he proue it thinke you? Let vs heare his wordes and reason.
                  92. Pope Gregory the 13. (saith he) hath ratifyed the foresaid Glosse and Annotatiōs,

And will any man of sense belieue this to be true? It is incredible. And how then doth he auouch it? Or what reason can he alleadge for it? You shall heare his ma

Morton will needs inferre, that for so much as Pope Gregory did ordayne, that all the whole Corps of the Canon law should be printed togeather, according to the Roman Copie, as well of Constitutions, Decrees, Extrauagants, Glosses, Annotations, and the rest, he made them all equall, and of the same and equall authority, for so runne his wordes: Pope G

Morton, would haue had the face to alledge this Licence of printing, for an equalling the credit and authority of all the things printed? Can there any match be found to this? Tell me I pray you, when king Henry the eight did allow at the beginning, and gaue priuiledg for printing the great English Bible with Tindals notes (which afterward he called in againe & censured for hereticall, did he therby make these notes of Tindall of equall Authority with the Scripture it selfe? Or if Queene Elizabeth did approue the printing of the English new Testament with Beza his notes, did she therby equall the said Notes with the text of the Testament it selfe? VVho would reason so, or who would go about so to abuse his Reader, and himselfe, that had care of conscience or credit? Can

these fraudes be committed but of deliberation and set purpose? Surely if any one such tricke should be brought and proued against any writer of ours, it were inough to shame him for euer. Let any man read the said Breue of Gregory the 13. and he will say, that these men are driuen to great extremities, when they are forced to lay hands vpon such base and bare thiftes.
                  94. But let vs see how he shifteth of the last two charges of adding to the beginning, and cutting frō the end of the sentence alleadged out of the Glosse. He sayth to the first, that albeit the wordes Apostat
                           •
                         Princes be not in the text of the Glosse,
                        Extrauag. Cōmun. l. 1. de maiorit. & Obed. cap. 1. ad finem.
                      
                     totidem verbis, that is in precise wordes (nor indeed are they found at all:) yet may the matter handled in that Glosse be extended vnto them, and to their deposition, for so much as in that glosse is disputed the Popes authority in generall ouer temporall Princes: which is farre fetcht as you see, to be set downe by him in a different letter, as the very wordes not only of the Glosse, but also of the Canon or Extrauagant it selfe. And as for the second clause which is the cutting of the last wordes of the sentence, Nisi vnicum post se talem Vicarium reliquisset &c. he answereth thus: VVhat needed any addition of that which was sufficiently expressed in my Aduersaryes obiection? But Syr, we require no addition by you, but why did you cut of these last wordes of the sentence that immediatly followed in the Glosse, and made so much for explication of his meaning? What need these niblings, strechings, and other such shifts in so small sentences (as now we are to see also in the next imputation) but only that the misery and necessity of your cause cannot else be defended? For that otherwise it may be supposed, that you are not so delighted in falshood, as to vse it so often, without

vtility or necessity: yea more or les

                     e in euery least sentēce lightly, that is alleaged, as now the Reader shall see in another that ensueth. In the meane space it is euident, that you are so farre of from being able to deliuer your selfe from the Charge and imputation of falshood in this place obiected, as you haue incurred new, and that most notorious in slaundering Pope Gregory the 13. to haue equalled Glosses and Annotations with Extrauagants and Canonicall Decrees, which neuer passed through his cogitations. And the mistaking is not only ridiculous, but also malicious, to discredit therby Pope Gregory, as by it self is most euident.
               
            
            
               THE EIGHT Imputation of falshood pretended to be answered by T. M. §. VIII.
               
                   THIS eight imputation in like manner, is about an other wilfull corruption vsed by M. Morton in a litle sentence alleaged by him out of Cardinall Bellarmine,

Campian, Genebrard, & other Catholike writers, for holding the heresy of the Autotheans, who deny Christ to be God of God

Light of Light, as the Councell of Nice teacheth vs to speake, but that he is God of himself: which doctrine notwithstanding M. Morton said, that Cardinall Bellarmine holdeth for Catholicall, and consequently he both deliuereth Caluin and Beza from imputation of heresy therin, and is contrary to his fellowes, who of ignorance or passion ascribed this for heresy to Caluin and Beza; wherin M. Morton goeth about by Equiuocation to beguile his Reader. For albeit Bellarmine doth teach that in some sense it may be truly said, that Christ is God of himselfe: yet absolutely doth he condemne the speach of Caluin for hereticall therin, and he proueth it by many arguments, which point M. Morton concealed, and besydes craftely corrupted the words alleaged out of Bellarmine, as presently will be seene. For thus my former Charge was made after the recitall both of M. Morton and Cardinall Bellarmines wordes at large.
               
                  The Charge.
                  
                     96. But now (said I) aswell Caluin and Beza (as
                           Mitig. p. 230. also M. VVillet and Doctor Fulke their Schollers) in a particuler sense (saith our Minister) do deny Christ to be God of God, to wit, that the Essence of his God-head hath no generation, though as he is Sonne, and the second person in Trinity, he is by generation from his Father:Bellarm. wordes fraudulē

                         while I examine the matter it selfe, and diligently

consider Caluins opinions, I do not easely presume to pronoūce him to haue bin in this errour, to wit, in the particuler errour, or heresy of the Autotheans, set downe and confuted by Genebrard, and in his sense condēned expresly by the anciēt Catholike Church, for denying Christ to be, and to haue his Essence from the Father: but yet though in some sense it seemeth to Bellarmine, that Caluin may be excused in this priuate & particuler meaning of his, yet not absolutely as T. M. would m
                           •
                        ke his Reader to thinke, by striking out cūningly the particle hoc (this errour) & leauing the word (error) in cōmon, as though Bellarmine had excused him from all kind of errour, which is most false, for that presently after, he both impugneth of purpose and confuteth by many arguments his manner of speach, as hereticall in this behalfe.
                  
                  
                     97. Restat (saith he) vt modum loquendi Calumi, qui dicit Filium à se habere essentiam, simpliciter esse repudiandum,
& contrario modo loquendum esse demonstremus &c. It remayneth that we do demonstrate Caluins manner of speach,Caluins manner of speach cō
                           demned by Bellarmine. that saith the Sonne to haue his essence of himselfe, is simply to be reiected, and that we must speake in a quite contrary manner, to wit, that the Sonne hath not only his person, but essence also from the Father, and so is God of God, and light of light, as the Councell of Nice declared: and this he proueth  by foure wayes. First, Quia pugnat cum Verbo Dei, 
                         for that Caluins manner of speach is opposite to the word of God &c. Pugnat secundò cum Concilijs, and secondly it is repugnāt to the manner of speach of ancient  Councels, as the Nicene and others. Pugnat tertiò  cum doctrina Patrum, thirdly it is contrary to the doctrine of the old Fathers. Fourthly it agreeth with the speach of the old Arians: and other such proofes, which Bellarmine doth prosecute at large, cōfirming ech one of these members by diuers examples and

instances, and that Caluin spake heretically in fauour of the Arians in this behalfe.
                  
                  
                     98. So as the cosenage heere of striking out (hoc) out of Bellarmines wordes, making him to say, non audeo pronuntiare illos in errore 
                              •
                           uisse, insteed of illum in hoc errore fuisse, though it be small in sound of wordes, yet in substance it is much. For that therby Thomas Morton would make his reader belieue that Bellarmine cleareth Caluin & Beza frō all sortes of errour in this point, and for that propose turneth illum into illos, & hoc errore, into errore, that is to say, him into them, and this errour, into any errour at all: wheras Bellarmine though in one sense he excuse him, yet absolutely doth he condemne him, as you haue heard. And no man can deny, but that his latin wordes were heere fraudulently and per
                           •
                        idiously alleadged, and mangled by Thomas Morto
                              •
                           , for that he could not do it but wittingly and of purpose: and yet forsooth this man will not equiuocate as he saith for a world, though lye he will manifestly for much lesse as yow see.
Thus wrote I then.
               
               
                  The pretended Discharge.
                  99. For answere to this Charge M. Morton saith three things. First, that for a signe of his sincere meaning, and that he had not any such diuelish disposition to cosen his Reader,Poore & weak answeres. as is pretended, he alledgeth that he left the latin sentence of Bellarmine vntranslated: wheras if he had recited it also in English, he had layd as it were a double nett to trap his Reader &c. But this is a poore excuse: For he that shall read the contexture and threed of his text in that place, shall see that he could not conueniently bring in the sentence of Bellarmine Englished, but it was inough to cite the latin wordes for the more learned, and deceaue the vulgar Reader with the

false assertion, that Bellarmine held the doctrine of Caluin and Beza for Catholike, without any mislike or reprehension at all.
                  100. Secondly for nibling of the word hoc, and citing errore, for hoc errore, he saith the fault was nothing,
                        Preamb. p. 113. for that all was one in Bellarmines speach. For proofe wherof he runneth to diuers experiments of speach, as before to the Alehouse and Ale-wyues about spilling and shedding ale: so heere he taketh example of his Hostesse and of eating at the table, affirming that if one should say, of two sortes of bread vsed at table, giue me the courser bread, and his seruant should fetch him hors-bread, 
                        •
                     or that he had not added (hoc) that is to say, giue me of this sort of courser bread, and not hors-bread, for so much as it was so to be vnderstood of it self: so when the question was about a particuler heresy of the Autotheans, when Bellarmine deliuered Caluin (ab errore) it was as much to say, as ab hoc errore, from this particuler errour. And the like he answereth about illos for illum, saying that for so much as Bellarmin doth afterward in the same place exuse one Simlerus a follower of Caluin for the same opinion o
                        •
                      
                     Caluin, he doth consequently also excuse Beza: and so M. Morton might quote illos for illum.
                  
                  101. Thus he trifleth out matters ad excusanda
                           •
                         excusationes in peccatis. And what may not be defended or deluded in this sort? but let him answere directly and substantially to this demaund?M. Mortō hardly pressed. VVhy had not he (if he had meant playnly and sincerely) set downe Bellarmines wordes as he found them in his text? especially they being so few? VVhy did he alter them? VVas it by chance or of purpose? If by errour he missed in the citation, why happened it vpon those things that were all to his aduantage? To witt, the leauing out of (hoc) therby to make

it seeme that Bellarmine cleered Caluin of all errour in that matter, wherin he expressely condemned him quoad modū loquendi, in his manner of speach, which he proueth to be hereticall by foure sortes of arguments, as now you haue heard. Or why had not M. Morton so much as mentioned this condemnation by Bellarmine, seing it imported the matter so mightely? If it were not by chance, but by industry and set purpose (though it be but a word:) yet is it sufficient to argue the faulty mynd of the Corrupter. And in this sort might I argue in all the rest of other points, that are peruerted: It could not probably fall out (especially so often) by chāce or errour, ergo of purpose, ergo of fraudulent meaning, and of desyre to deceaue. And so much for this to prooue in M. Morton mentem reā, a guilty mind, that according to S. Augustins iudgement maketh him mendacij reum, guilty of willfull lying, though it be but in smaller things, where malyce is more thē the matter it self.
                  102. Hytherto M. Morton hath gone vp and downe, seeking and picking out the weakest sort of imputatiōs layd against him
                        •
                      wherunto he thought himself best able to make some shew of probable answere: wherin notwithstanding you haue seene how litle he hath beene able to performe in any substance of truth, and how in three or foure of these eyght aready proposed, he hath beene forced eyther to confesse,M. Mort. idle repetition of thinges before discussed. that he saw not the Authour which he cited, or to remit vs to other men for answering the falshoodes therin obiected. And now he betaketh himselfe to another shift, for making vp a number of imputations, as satisfyed by him (for it seemed somewhat to touch his credit to answere fourteene imputations, which was the nū
                     ber he obiected against me, though he leaue more

then twice fourteene vnanswered) and this new shift is to repeate, and bring in agayne in this place fiue seuerall imputations treated both by him, and vs before, and some of them twice at least: and yet would he nedes fetch them in the third tyme, not for want of other layd against him, of much more force & difficulty to be answered, but for that these being things of small moment, and lightly obiected for such by me, they do serue him to make a bulke of worke, as though he had dispatched much matter, and solued great difficultyes, wheras indeed they are nothing but wordes, on his behalfe, and ostentatiō without substance. Let vs see then what they are.
               
            
            
               THE NINTH Imputation twice handled before, and now again
                     •
                   brought in by M. Morton. §. IX.
               
                   THIS is about a place of Isay the Prophet in the 29. Chapter and 9. verse,About a place of Isay 29. where it is said in the common Latin trāslation of S. Hierome, Obstupescite & admiramini, fluctuate & vacillate, inebriamini, & non à vino, mouemini, & non ab ebrietate:
                  
                     See before cap. 1. §. 5. & cap. 4. §. 10 Be ye astonished and wonder, wauer yee and reele, yee are drunke, but not with wine, ye are moued but not with drunkennesse: and cōforme to this are the other texts also both in Hebrue & Greeke. VVhich sentence M. Morton translateth into English,
                     Isay. 29.9. & setteth it forth for his poesie in the first page of his booke in these wordes: But stay your selues and wonder, they are blind and make you blind,
                  
                     Mitig. p. 88. applying it to our Catholicke Doctors and doctrine: for which I noted him only in the end of my second Chapter, for falsly

alleaging, corrupting, and mangling this place: the Reader will se my reason by looking vpon the text. And how little he hath bene able to say for himselfe in iustification of this his fancy, may be seene in the two Chapters before mentioned. And so we passe to another as trifling as this.
            
            
               THE TENTH Imputation twyce also handled before, and now againe brought in by M. Morton. §. X.
               THIS also is a Colewort twice already sodden, and now brought in agayne the third tyme, for  lacke of better victualls, to witt, about the text of Carerius the Paduan Doctor,About verè & verò in Careriꝰ whether it should be Nuperrimè verè Celsus, or nuperrimè verò Celsus, wherof I spake but a word or two in my Treatise of Mitigation,
                  
                     Mitigation p. 234. censuring it for a trifle: and now M. Morton hath so stretched out the matter, for that he may seeme to haue some litle patronage for his errour by the later errour of another prynt,
                     See before cap. 1. §. 6. & cap. 4. §. 10. as hauing brought it in twice already in two seuerall Chapters for an ostentation of his manhood, he cōmeth now againe the third tyme with the same thing, as you see, wheras my booke might haue lent him a great many of other more reall Charges, wherin his said manhood might better haue beene tryed. But he desired only to make a florish.
            
            
               
               THE ELEVENTH Imputation pretended to be answered, which is handled also before. §. XI.
               
                   THIS Imputation was for that M. Morton had affirmed that Doleman doth pronounce sētence,About Dolman falsely alleged. 
                  That whosoeuer shall consent to the succession of a Protestant Prince, is a most grieuous and damnable synner. VVhich sentence I do affirme in my Treatise of Mitigation, that it is neyther in wordes nor in sense to be found in Doleman,
                  
                     See cap. 1. §. 7. which I do proue by producing his whole text that hath no such wordes, though M. Mo
                        •
                     ton hath sett them downe in a different letter,

                     •
                   wordes. Nor are they there in true sense, as more preiudiciall to Protestants, then to men of other religion: for that the discourse is generall for all sortes of men of what Religiō or sect soeuer, that they do sinne grieuously, if willingly they doe concurre to the making of a King, whome they thinke in their conscience to be contrary to Gods true religion? Where M. Mortō
                   (saying nothing to the substance of the matter it selfe) indeuoureth to shew, that as a man may sometymes alleage the sense of Scriptures only, and not the very wordes,Impertinēt 
                        •
                     itations. citing for the same diuers examples, as Ephes. 5.14. Heb. 1. 1. Heb. 3.5. Act. 10.43. and so might he alleage the sense of Doleman though he varied from his wordes. But I deny, that eyther the true wordes, or true sense of Doleman was related by him, and consequently, it cannot be excused from a witting falshood. See this matter handled before Cap. 1. §. 7.

               IT is a great argument of M. Mortons penury that  he is forced to repeat things so often,About Otho Frisingensis peruerted
                        •
                     
                   thereby to make some shew of answering to somwhat, though in truth it be nothing in effect: for that he dissembling aboue 30. weighty and maine Charges giuen him by his Aduersary, as will appeare in the next Chapter, he seeketh to intertaine his Reader heere with smaller matters, twice or thrice repeated.

And now this thirteenth Imputation, if yow remē
                  ber, was about alleaging the authority of the Historiographer Otto Frisingensis, against the cause of Pope Gregory the seauenth, in fauour of the Emperour Henry the fourth, quite contrary to the wordes & meaning of the said Historiographer, who defendeth the cause of the said Pope, speaking much good of his lyfe & vertue. And M. Mort. is so farre of frō being able to quit himself from false dealing in this behalf, as he is forced partly to lay the fault vpon others, as vpon Doctor Tolo
                        •
                     anus, partly to abuse the name and testimony of Claudius Espencaeus, and make him to say and auerre that which he doth not, but relateth out of others: And in no one Imputation hitherto touched was he more graueled then in this, as the Reader may see by turning to the place it self. So as it is strange that M. Morton will bring in this againe,

But now leauing this, let vs peruse another defence of his, which he hath chosē to make, as the last prize of his maistery in this behalfe: and it being reserued by him for the last place, we may imagine, it will be a good one.
            
            
               THE FOVRTEENTH and last Imputation of falshood pretended by M. Morton to be triumphantly answered. §. XIIII.
               FOR the last place and vpshot of this Combat, M. Morton hath made choice of an Imputation which he pretendeth not only with great aduantage

to be able to repell and shake of from himselfe, but to retort the same in like manner vpon his aduersary, &  therfore he intertaineth himselfe longer therin then in any other hitherto named,About Lāmbertus Scafnaburg. peruerted. & deuideth his answere both into a seuerall preface & foure distinct heads or paragraphs, promising in the one to shew the falsity of this obiected Imputatiō: in the second the foolishnes: in the third the vn

                     •
                  ourth the blasphemy. And surely if he can, not only cleere himself from the imputation, but proue also these foure points against me for obiecting the same, or any one of them (which is more liberality then he demādeth) I will say that he hath shewed manhood indeed in this last attēpt, to recompēce the Childhood we haue found in all the rest.
               109. But yet before we passe to the particuler triall, I must needes tell him friendly, that this aduētrous anymosity of his is not allwaies either cōmēdable or fortunate, as we shall shew in our eight Chapter, where we shall be forced to treat somewhat of his cōfident & audacious o
                     •
                  fers & protestatiōs. And for that he termeth the Charge made by me of this imputation an Inditemēt, I shal vse the same Metaphor in this my Answere & aduertismēt vnto him, which is that I haue heard of sundry in England, who being called into suspition about criminall imputations,M. Mortōs fond animosity, whereo

(saith your Chronographer) was excommunicate of the Bishops of Italy, for that he had defamed the Apostolike Sea by Symony & other capital crymes.

As if this our Chronographer had related this as a thing of truth against the said Pope, or that it were approued by him, and not rather as a slanderous obiection cast out by his aduersaries that followed the part of Henry the Emperour.

But with all men of sound wisdome, it was more cleere then the sunne, that the things which were spoken against Pope Hildebrand were false; for that the Pope did lead such an excellent & Apostolicall life, as the sublimity of his conuersation did admit no least spot of wicked rumour against him, he lyuing in that great Citty & open concourse of men, it could not haue byn hidden, if he had cōmitted any vnlawfull thing in his life. And moreouer, the signes & miracles which by his prayers were often times done, & his most feruent zeale for God in defen

                              •
                           allaciae. The constancie of Pope Hildebrand and his inuincible mind against the corruption of auarice, did exclude all arguments of humane fallacie and deceipt. So Lambertus.
                     
                  
                  112. And now let the Reader consider, with what conscience & fidelity T. M. hath cyted him for cōdemnatiō of Pope Hildebrād. He relateth indeed, what certaine Noblemen, Captaines & others that came with the Emperour to the Cas

Apostolicall legation sent vnto them, & to cast vpon the Pope all the most foule reproaches & maledictions that furie could suggest vnto them. Thus saith Lambertus: and then setteth downe the particuler slanderous reproaches heere cyted by T.M. which he approueth not, but condemneth as you haue heard, and highly commendeth not only the vertue, but sanctity also of the Pope. And will euer any man credit T.M. any more in any thing that he alleageth, when this cōscienceles falsification is once discouered in him? yea though it were but once throughout his whole Booke, it were sufficiēt to proue that he dealeth not out of any faith or conscience at all.
                  
                  
                     
                        A comparison expressing the fraud of T. M.113. If an enemy would discredit both Christ & Christian Religion, and say, your owne Euangelistes do recount foule things against him (as here this Minister saith our historiographer doth of Pope Gregory) and namely that he was accused by the Scribes & Pharisies for casting out diuells in the power of Beelzebub, for deceauing the people, for denying tribute to be paid to Cesar, for mouing sedition, and other like crymes, which our Euangelistes doe recount indeed, but do condemne them also as false and calumnious: were not this as good and faithfull a manner of reasoning, as this other of Thomas Morton out of Lambertus and Fri

                           ingensis against pope Hildebrand, who is by thē both most highly cōmended, as you haue heard, and his aduersaries condemned? Truly, if any man can shew me out of all the Catholicke writers that be extant, English or other, that euer any one of them vsed this shamefull fraud in writing, where no excuse can free them from malicious and witting falshood, then will I grant that it is not proper to the Protestant spirit alone. Hithert

And this shall suffice for a tast only of M. Mortons manner of proceeding: for that to prosecute all particulers would

require a whole volume, and by these few you may ghesse at the mans veyne and spirit in writing.
So I wrote then in my Treatise of Mitigation.

                         M. Mortons narration out of Lābert. about Pope Gregories excōmunication. 
                     The Bishops of Italy did excommunicate Pope Gregory for capitall crimes. But why is this impudencie? As if (saith P. R.) this our Chronographer had related this as a thing of truth, or that it were approued of him, and not rather as a slanderous obiection cast out by his Aduersaries that followed the part of Henry the Emperour &c. The point now in question is, whether this Author Lambertꝰ Schafnaburge was of this opiniō? Which P. R. denieth, calling my assertion an impudent impiety. Let vs be iudged by the euidence of the Author himself

who in the place alleadged hath these words:

                        Postquam per It
                              •
                           liam fama percrebuisset &c. After that the fame was spread abroad throughout Italie that K. Henrie had set his foot in their coastes (certatim omnes Italiae Episcopi &c.) All the Bishops of Italy did flocke by troups vnto him, receauing him with all honour worthy the magnificence of such a person, and within a few daies after, an army of an infinite multitude was gathered vnto him: for from the first time that he was King, the longed for his comming into Italy, because at this time Italy was pestered with the euery. And what els? It followeth a litle a
                              •
                           ter. Besides they (viz. the Bishops & people) did cōgratulate his cōming, because it was reported that he came with a resolute courage to depose (Gregory) the Pope. Heere we see it graunted by Lambert, that all the Bishops of Italy were desirous to haue this Pope Gregory deposed.
Thus far are M. Mortons wordes.
                  116. But to beginne with that which he last mentioneth of all the Bishops of Italy, the word all is fraudulently vrged by him, as you will see: so that scarsly in any thing doth he deale sincerely, for albeit these wordes be in Lambertus, Certatim ad eum omnes Italiae Episcopi & Comi

                     119.

                  121. Wherfore we see M. Morton brought heere into great straites, and forced first to chang the whole state of the question: and then to say, that I did deny that which I did not, and himselfe to affirme that thing which is neither to the purpose, nor can be proued to be true. For neither did I deny that Lambertus knew of such a condemnation, nor is M. Morton able out of him to proue, that he knew it. And if it were, yet is it a very absurd and iniurious manner of proceeding, vpon another mans relation only, without approbation or

                        Preamb. p. 120. & 121.124. After all this (saith he) the Emperour goeth to Rome, seeketh absolution of the Pope, returneth backe againe, and the Bishop Eppo is sent after to signify to the Italians this submission to the Pope. VVhat now? Now followeth the testimony which was alleaged: Qui cum causā Italis expofuisset &c. VVhen Eppo had told his message to the Italians, all of them began to rage and fret &c. casting vpon the Pope all opprobrious reproaches, whom all the Bishops of Italy had before iustly excōmunicated, because by Symony he had defiled the Sea Apostolicke. Could this Cronologer but acknowledg that the Pope had byn excōmunicated by the Bishops of Italy, who (as he cōfessed in the beginning) did reioice at the cōming of the Emperour, because he came with a resolution to depose the Pope?
                  
                  125. To this now I haue answered, that this is not the point in question, whether this Cronologer acknowleged the Pope to haue byn excōmunicated by sōe schismaticall Bishops of Italy or no: but whether he approued the same or no, by alleaging a cause: for so saith M. Mortons first accusation in these words before alleaged: Pope Greg. the 7. (saith Lābertus) was excōmunicated of the Bishops of Italy,The vnfaithfull dealing of T.M. in alleaging Lā
                        bertꝰ his wordes. 
                     for that he had defamed the Apostolicke Sea by Symony, & other Capitall crymes. By which words it is euident that M. Mortons intent was to make his Reader belieue, that Lambertus knew there was such a deposition, and besids reproued not the same, in that he alleaged so graue a cause and motiue therof. In both which points M. Morton doth maliciously deceaue his Reader: for neither doth Lambertus expressely affirme the thing it self, (that is to say, that he was excommunicated by those bishops, but only that his passionate enemies in their fury & rage said so:) neither did he any way approue or allow thereof, but impug
                        •
                     e it. Neither doth he assigne this Reason (for that he had defamed the Apostolike Sea by Simony)
                     
as M. Morton affirmeth, and after againe in other words, because by Simony he had defyled the Sea Apostolick. For making vp of which sense M. Morton corrupteth againe the text of Lambertus, putting in (quia) for (qui) so as euer he must help the die in somewhat. The words of Lambertus may be sene a litle before in our Charge, to wit: That those seditious Italian people that were banded against the Pope, and grieued with the peace made betwene the Emperour and him, did fret and wax fierce both in words, and casting their hands, and with scornefull outcries to contradict his Apostolicall legation sent vnto them: and did cast vpon the Pope all the most foule reproaches and maledictions that fury could suggest vnto them. VVhich words for the most part M. Morton leaueth out, as you may see in his English citation, & he adioyneth, whome all the Bishops of Italy had before iustly excōmunicate, because by Symony he had de
                           •
                        yled the Sea Apostolik. But the words of Lābert are, Sese excōmunicationem illius nihili aestimare &c. that they did esteme nothing his excōmunication, whom all the Bishops of Italy for iust cause had excōmunicated, who had by violence obteyned the Sea Apostolike by the heresy of Simony, and had defiled the same by murthers, adulteries, and other Capitall crimes. In which words we find nothing spoken against the Pope on the part of Lābertus, or as approued by him, but vtterly reproued as proceding from rage & furie of those schismaticall people. And is this a good witnes? & secōdly we fynd no causatiue for that, or because by Simony he had defiled &c. vttered either on the part of Lābert, or of the Schismatikes, but a thing made out of the malice of M. Morton, who turneth Qui Sedem Apostolicā
                     ; into Quia Sedem Apostolicam per Symoniā &c. to make it seme to be a reasō of their deposing Pope Greg. wheras Lamb. doth not recite it as a reasō (wch allwais supposeth some ground of truth) but ōly as a meere malicious calūniatiō, cōtumely, & reproach proceeding from men put in fury by suddaine discontentment and despaire. And thus hath M. Mort. deliuered himself in the first point from falsity according to his fashiō, in adding more falsityes to the former. Let vs see his second point which he termeth the foolishnes & so

                     olly he foundeth vpon this principle: That an Author may be cited to testify some fact, without regard of his approouing or reproouing the thing: and that so he cited Lambertꝰ as testi
                           •
                        ying that Pope Gregory was excōmunicated by the Bishops of Italy, though not approouing the same as lawfully donne. Wherunto first we answere, that whē nothing is fought but the bare testimony of the fact, this ground may be admitted: as in the example before alleaged of the Child in the case of his Father,How Lamb. autority might haue byn alleaged without lying. if a man would only make knowne that such and such crimes had byn obiected against the Father, which there we mētioned, he might with sincerity alleage the testimony of his sonne that complained of the same, as we are wont to do in the history of Saints liues, putting downe their reproches published against them by aduersaries; but in this, if we will proceed with Christian truth and sincerity, we must alleadg such facts in such sense as the Relator or witnes meant them, to wit, shewing that they were falsly, wrongfully and iniuriously obi
                        •
                     cted. And so in this our Case, if M. Morton had only alleaged the testimony of Lambertus for the fact and speaches of these passionate men against Pope Gregory, and had added more ouer sincerely for the discrediting therof, that which the Author addeth, to wit, that it it was false and spoken in passion and fury of anger &c. and had told in like māner the contrary vertues that were in Pope Gregory which Lambertus recounteth, it might well haue passed: but doing the plaine contrary, and endeauoring to defame Pope Gregory by him that greatly defēdeth and cōmendeth both his person and cause, it may be wit in M. Morton, as wit goeth with him, that calleth me a foole for holding the contrary: But sure I am, honesty it can not be, which is neuer separated from truth & plaine dealing.
                  127. And this shal suffice for this point, p̄termitting sōe other trifles, which M. Mort. toucheth in this place vpon some stomake of reuenge, as it semeth, though meerly false, & without any 
                        •
                     oundation. And therfore passing to his third point of infelicity, which he will needs

lay vpō me, for obiecting this matter of Lambertꝰ against him, we shall see, whether he hath any more substance in this, then in the former.
                  128. First of all noteth me not only for not acute (as his words are) but for absurde,
                     Infelicity obiected against the argumēt of P. R. in that I do say, that Lambertus doth highly commend not only the vertue, but also the sanctity of Pope Gregory: as though (saith he) vertue and sanctity were different things, and might be separated. Wherin I know not how acute M. Morton may seeme to the iudicious Reader, for so much as euery man knoweth lightly that vertue is commonly held but for the way to sanctity, & that via & terminus are different things. And I presume M. Mort. himselfe will make profession of some kind of vertue, though not pretend perchance to be yet a full Saint, at leastwise in this common sense of Sanctity, wherin it is taken & vnderstood ordinarily for aggregation of all vertues in their perfection.
                  129. Well, I know that the word Sanctity is takē also in some other sense,Diuers acceptiōs of Sā
                        ctity. as namly for that Sanctity which we receaue by our redēption & vocation by Christ, in which sense all baptized Christiās are called Saints by vocatiō, though afterward in life they should be neuer so wicked euen as S. Paul writing to the Corinthiās,
                     1. Cor. 1. 2. Cor. 1. & 15. termeth thē 
                     vocatis Sanctis, Saintes by vocatiō: though afterwards he signifieth diuers of thē to be loaden with grieuous & heinous sinnes, and of these Saints there is store in the world.
                  130. Thirdly, Sanctity is takē also of Scholmē for a speciall vertue, not differing in substāce from the verue of Religiō, but only that it hath a certaine generality in it, not only to apply our minds firmly to Gods seruice, but also to li

                     t vp all the works of other morall vertues vnto the same seruice & honor of God: as for exāple the act of abstinēce or temperance which in a morall man may be vsed to other morall ends, as to the health of body, opinion of sobriety & the like, this speciall vertue of Sanctity directeth the same to the glory of Almi. God: & the like in the actions of all other moral vertues. But for so much as concerneth our matter, Sanctity was taken

by me in the first sense, wherin a man may be vertuous, and yet no Saint, according to the definition of S. Dionysius Areopagita.

                         wickednes: which is somewhat more if you marke it then common vertue, as M. Morton would haue it. And thus much for his acutenes in reprehending my speach in distinguishing vertue from sanctitie, which it seemeth that either he vnderstood not, or considered not well of his reprehensiō before he vttered it: but to the matter it selfe for proof of my vnlucky imputing falshood vnto him in alleaging the authoritie of Lambertus, he bringeth forth three witnesses, to wit, Benno Cardinalis, Abbas Vrspergensis & Sigebertus, all German writers, that reprehend the life of Pope Greg. the 7. called before Hildebrandu
                           •
                        . But what infelicitie is this vnto my imputation out of Lābertus? It is felicitie inough for my attempt (if M. Mort. will needs haue it so) that he hath not byn able to cleere him selfe from opē fraud in alleaging Lambertus against Pope Hildebrand, as now you haue heard. This other is a new matter and from the purpose: whether there be other Authors that speake and write euill of Pope Gregory or no? it is sufficient for me to haue shewed that Lambertus did not, but in his behalfe and prayse, & consequently that he was falsely brought in for his discredit.
                  132. But yet to say somewhat of these three other Authors also alleaged here by M. Morton to proue my infelicitie, that in taking frō him one Lambertus I haue gotten three others to come out against me, to wit, a Monke, an Abbot, & a Cardinall:The bad Card. Benno and his feygned booke by the Protestantes. I will answere first vnto the Cardinall, to wit Benno, who being not made by the true Pope Gregory the 7. but by the Antipope calling himselfe Clement the 3. at the procurement of the Emperour, that was his professed enemy, he cānot be accompted either a true Cardinall, or a lawfull witnes, & therefore no maruaile, though in the booke ascribed

vnto him by the Protestāts of our days, he be found to raile most intēperatly against the true Pope Greg. about which booke of Bēno notwithstanding I referre me to the Iudgment of another Cardinall whose name beginneth with the same letters, I meane Card. Bellarmine, who hauing diligētly pervsed the said rayling booke, testifieth that he found it excessiue railing, & so extreme full of lies, cōtrary to the writings of all other Authors, that had written of the same Pope, either whiles he liued or after his death vntill Luthers time (wherof he nameth 32. Anthors in particuler, & ten of thē that wrot whiles he was liuing) as he protesteth, that he was forced to doubt least some L
                           •
                        theran had writtē the same vnder the name of the foresaid false Card. Benno. Wherfore of this man, being such as he was & conuinced for an open liar by so many witnesses, we say no more, but leaue him to M. Morton, as a fit Knight of the Post for his purpose.
                  133. As for the other two monkes, Vrsperg. & Sigebertus, the same Card. Bellarmines iudgmēt is,
                        Bellar. l. 4. de Rō. Pontif. c. 13. that albeit they being fauorers of the Emperour in that factiō, durst not write ouer plainly in the praise of Pope Greg. & dispraise of his enemy the Emperor their patrone; yet doth he shew out of their workes, that setting aside a manifest error of Sigebert, that imagined Pope Gregory to be of opiniō that the Masle of a Concubinary Priest was not good (which he neuer said, but for a punishmēt only cōmanded men not to heare such a naughty Priest) in the rest Card. Bellarmine, as I said, doth proue that in sundry other occasions both of thē did rather cōmend Pope Greg. thē discommend him, as is euident out of sundry places in their owne workes which Bellarmine citeth.
                  134. But nothing doth discredit more the bringing in of these two witnesses by M. Mort. then the ioyning thē to Benno, as though they had byn of his opinion, or had written against Pope Gregory as he did. Let vs examine but only this one place alleaged heere out of Vrsperg. & then let any man say,
                        Preamb. p. 123. what is to be thought of M. Mort. fidelity: thus he alleageth him. The Abbot Vrsperg. (saith he)

                           •
                        im: and that the Coūcell of Bishops at Brixia did depose him: the Asts of which Coūcell, as they are recited by Vrspergēsis shew these causes: because he was an vsurper o
                           •
                         the Sea &c. And the Coūcell at Mentz An. 1085. declared him to be iustly deposed. Thus we see that P. R. by denying one Coūcell of Bishops of Italy in Papia, to haue opposed thēselues against this Gregorie, hath contrary to his desire, gayued with that one of Papia, three other Councells, one of Brixia,

                     another of Wormes, the last of Mentz. So vnlucky hath he byn &c.
                  
                  136. To this I answere first, that the whole supposall of this narratiō (to wit) that I did deny the Coū
                     cell or Conciliabulū
                      of Pauia to haue excōmunicated Pope Gregory is vtterly false.M. Mortons whole supposal false. For that this was not in questiō betweene vs, as hath appeared by the former discourse, but whether Lambertus did relate and allow of the same, or no: wherof neyther point is found in him, to wit, neither that he relateth the fact, as out of his owne asseueration, but only as obiected by passionate enemies, & much lesse doth he approue the lawfulnes therof but impugne it. This was the state of our question, which now M. Morton seing his errour would willingly chang: but nothing falleth out more aptly for his conuiction then the bringing in of Seuerinus Binius in this place to be a fourth witnes with Benno, Vrspergensis, and Sigebertus for disgracing of Pope Gregory, by affirming that he was condemned in foure seuerall Councells here mētioned. But what if Binius do expressely say, that all these Coū
                     cells were but factious metings and no Councells, and set vp by the Emperour & the Antipope made by him, for malice against the true Pope: & that they were wicked and schismaticall Bishops that met there in conspiracy against their true head? doth this serue to M. Mortons purpose for disgracing of Pope Gregory by Binius his testimony? Or doth he deale plainly with his Reader in telling him that Binius is a 4. witnes that ioyneth with Benno, Vrspergensis, & Sigebert, in condemning Pope Greg?
                  137. As for Benno the counterfait Card. no man denieth but that he did condemne Pope Gregory, if that Booke be his that goeth in his name: & the like we must vnderstand of Vrspergensis and Sigebert, if we belieue M. Morton, who saith that they wrote out of their owne iudgment against him,Benno the coū
                        terfaite Cardinall. wherof notwithstanding we haue shewed the contrary: how then can he coople Binius as a fourth witnes to these three, which Binius he confesseth to be contrary in iudgement, and to defend Pope Gregory most 
                        •
                     arnestly, calling these Councells Conciliabula, factious and

schismaticall conspiracies? Let vs set downe here a comparison for better cōceauing the matter.A comparison expressing M. Mortōs case of vnfaithfull dealing. If a Iew of our time should take vpon him to disgrace the Apostle S. Paul, as many of them haue sought to do, for enuy, that he was first a zealous follower of their law, and should reckon vp the conspiracies made against him in diuers tymes & different places, how he was condemned by sundry metings of principall men, both Iewes & Gentiles, often layd in pryson, often escaped by flying, and the like: inferring therof that he was a troublesome & euill man, & should for witnes hereof bring forth the testimonies, not only of some ancient hereticall enemy of his that liued with him, but other two also, who in the accu
                        •
                     ers opinion were not his frends, and then for a fourth witnesse should ioyne vnto them the testimony of S. Luke himself, that recounteth these things, but in the Apostles high praise, and then should vaunt, & tell his Reader, as heere M. Morton doth, that now he had foure witnesses conspiring togeather in the same matter: would you say that this man dealt otherwise then as a Iew indeed, that is to say, perfidiously?
                  138. Let vs heare then what this Binius cited here for the fourth witnes, saith against, or rather for, & in the behalfe of Pope Gregory. First he speaking of a certaine pious embassage or Legation sent by the said Pope to the excommunicated Henry, he saith thus: Quam cùm numinis contemptor & cultor per

                     The testimony of Binius for Pope Gregory.

                        •
                     sse to ioyne with the former for discrediting of Pope Gregory?

and may not a man aswell alleage S. Luke against S. Paul as Binius against this Pope in this cause?How absurdly blasphemy is obiected to P. R. for alleaging an example of the Euanglists. Or might not wee obiect the sacred sufferings and persecutions of that holy Apostle out of S. Luke by the same sort of argumēts that M. Morton doth here the conspiracies of the wicked Emperour & schismaticall Bishops against Pope Gregory their Apostolicall gouernour? though I do not compare the person of Pope Gregory with the person of S. Paul, as M. Morton will presently calumniate, but the manner of proceding and arguing in their supposed aduersaries, the Iew & M. Morton. But we shall haue occasion to speake more of this in the next point concerning blasphemy: for needs he will haue this my reprehension of him, not only to be false, foolish & vnlucky, as you haue heard, but also blasphemous: this point then we must in this last place consider of.
                  139. In the end of my former charge I do set downe an example to shew the absurdity of M. Mortōs disgracing of Pope Gregory out of the writings of Lambertꝰ & Frisingensis,
                     
                        Mitig. p. 217. by a comparison takē out of the new Testament in these words. If an enemy (said I) would discredit both Christ & Christiā religion, & say, Your owne Euangelists do recount foule things against him (as heere this Minister saith that our Historiographer doth o
                           •
                         Pope Gregory) & namely that he was accused by the Scribes & Pharisies for casting out diuells in the power of Beelzebub &c. which our Euangelistes do recoūt indeed, but do condemne thē also as false & calumnious, were not this as good & as faithfull a manner of reasoning, as this other of T. Morton out of Lambertus & Frising. against Pope Hildebrand, who is by them most highly commended?
                  
                  140. Thus I said at that tyme: & now M. Mort. āswereth that this comparison conteineth blaspemy,
                     What blasphemy is. which to me semeth strange. And if he had proposed the definition of blaspemie togeather with his accusation, the question would quickly haue byn decided. For that Schole-doctors do define blasphemie to be,
                        D. Tho. 2.2. q. 13. art. 1. 
                     Cùm aliquid negatur de Deo, quod ei conuenit, vel asseritur de eo, quod ei non conuenit. VVhen any thing is denied to be in God which is in him, or when any thing is affirmed to be in him, which agreeth not vnto him. By which definition M.

Mort. who
                        •
                     e accusation falleth to the ground. For that in my comparison nothing is falsely affirmed or denied to be in God at all: neither doth the comparison touch God himselfe in any affirmation or negation, but only a certaine māner of reasoning, that may be vsed by an enemie, concerning him; which I do shew to be like to that of M. Mortons: but let vs heare his proofes.
                  
                     
                        Preamb. p. 125.141. VVhosoeuer (saith he) shall exactly examine the Analogy of this comparison, must needs acknowl

                        dg it to be in a manner blasphemous. Marke how he beginneth to temper the matter, calling that in a manner blasphemous, which in the title of his Paragraph he absolutly calleth blaspemie. Let vs heare his reason: For either must Christ (saith he) the Sonne of God be compared with Pope Gregory, or 
                           •
                        lse the likenes consisteth in the cōparison of th

                        uangelists & their Monkes Frisingensis and Lambertus togeather. Wherto I answere, that M. Morton misseth wholy the cushion: for that in neither of these two is the comparison made, but in the manner of reasoning. For as it were no good forme of argument in an enemy to say, These & these things were obiected against Christ as your owne Euangelists do testify, ergo, he was no good man: So is it not in M. Mort. to say, These & these enormious crimes were obiected against Pope Greg., & recorded by your owne Monk
                           •
                        s Frising. & Lambertꝰ, Ergo, he was a wicked man. Wherein you see that the comparisō by me here brought in, is only in the forme of argumēt in the one & in the other case, and neither betwene Christ & Pope Gregory, nor betwen the Euāgelists & our Monkes is there any comparison made, except only in this, that as Christ was wrongfully slādered, so was Pope Gregory, & many other of his seruāts are daily: & as the Euāgelists should be greatly iniured to be brought in for witnesses as accusing our Sauiour, whō they most dutifully reuerenced & highly cōmended for that they recount slanders obiected against him, by enemies: so are Lambertꝰ & Frising
                           •
                        
                      no lesse abused in being cited 
                        •
                     or authors to disgrace Pope Gregory, whom they defended, iustified, & reuerenced. One other cōparison also may be betweene M. Morton & the enemy, who do reasō
                     
after one fashiō, & do seeke to deceiue after one manner.
                  142. These three later cōparisons I made not in my former speach, but only the first about the form of argumēt: these other do follow ex natura rei: nor is it blasphemy to frame a cōparison betwene God & man, or betweene him & inferior things to mā, so the point be true, wherin the comparison is made. And it seemeth great simplicity or peruersity in M. Mort. to hold the cōtrary: for that all the Scripture is full of comparisons betweene God, heauen, man & other Creatures;Comparisons may be piously made betweene God & creatures. which things, though in themselus they be not cōparable for their natures and qualities, yet may they be in some other points. As the kingdome of heauē is cōpared to a mustard-seed, & God to a husband man, yea to a couetous man, to a theefe that commeth in the night, which in the proportiō of their owne natures, worth, value, dignity or indignity are incōparable: yet in some respect cōparisons may be made without all blasphemy, which I do note the rather to the Reader,
                        Math. 13. for that it is a cōmon refuge of M. Mort. & his fellowes,
                        Luc. 23. when they are pressed with any similitude or cōparisō,
                        Matt. 20.
                     
                        Luc. 19. Luc. 12. to runne frō the point wherin the cōparison is made indeed and to seeke out disparities between the things thēselues in points wherin no comparison is made: As if a man out of the Ghospell should alleage any one of the forsaid similitudes;
                        Luc. 13. as that God is like the husband-man, in this point of cultiuating or dunging his groūd, his aduersary should laugh at him, and say it were blasphemy to cōpare such base things as dūging, to the vnspeakable maiesty of almighty God,A false trick or two in T. M. for a parting blow. which were a vayne cauill as you see, because in that point of dignity or indignity, worthines or basenes, the cōparison is not made; but only in cultiuating: & so is this of M. Morton. And with this we shall leaue him for this argument, only noting by the way, that notwithstanding all the disgrace he hath receaued for vnsincere dealing, yet cā he not passe ouer this place without shewing a tricke or two in that kind, euē in recityng my words.
                  143. For wheras I said: If an enemy would discredit both

Christ and Christian Religion, and say your owne Euangelists do recount &c. he reciteth my wordes thus: If any man would discredit both Christ and Christian religion, and say our Euangelists do recount &c. turning (an enemy) into (any man) and (your Euangelists) into (our Euangelists) in the first person, and all this to make my speach seeme more odious by these slippery trickes and helping the dye vnderhand, for that my similitude soundeth differently from the mouth of an enemy, and from a man of our owne Religiō. And finally I would aske M. Morton why he did change these words, if he had no intent of falshood, for so much as the other were as few and as easily to be written as these: but because this Paragraph was to charg me with blasphemy, and finding nothing in my words sounding that way, he thought good by altering them, to make some little appearance: which is an art most vsuall with him. Let him shew the same but in any of our writers, and I promise to stād to my offer before made of neuer belieuing him afterward; which I confesse, that I must performe in like manner towards M. Morton, vntill I see him alter his course, and become more scupulous of truth, and punctuall sinceritie in his writings.

Morton taking vpon him to answere to the charges of falshood & vntrue dealing layd against him in my late Treatise of Mitigation, chose out fourteene of those which he thought he could best answere, or make some shew at least of satisfaction vnto them, which he hath performed in the manner that you haue heard, to wit, first leauing out the greatest number of such as pressed him most, as in the sequent Chapter you are to behold And albeit he professed in the beginning to satisfy those that I most insisted in, yet that hath appeared to be false, and may be tried

               145. Secondly, for furnishing vp the shew of these fourten Charges pretēded to be discharged by him, he hath layd hāds of sundry that are very impertinent, & scarse obiected by me as pointes of moment. For which cause he hādleth thē ouer againe & againe, & some three tim

                   as you haue heard: as namely the 9.10.11.12. & 13. where as once handling had bin sufficient, especially for that others remayned of far greater weight to haue bin treated, if he had listed or thought it easy.
               146. Thirdly, of the rest which he pretendeth to satisfy (for touching sōe, he cōfesseth in effect his owne weaknes & imbecility, either dēying that he read the books & Authors, which he had cyted & vrged against vs, or remitting vs to other men for the answere, that had lēt him the said authorities) are the 2. the 4. the 5. & 6. So as these two sorts making vp ten of his fourteen Charges, there remayned to him but foure more to discharge, which how māfully he hath performed I remit me to the view, wherby wilbe seen (I doubt not) that he hath not 
                        •
                     nly not wyped of the scarrs (to vse his phrase) of the former imputatiōs, but hath made also many more, not only scars & scratches, but also deeper woūds a new by making new escapes no lesse enormous then the former: & cōsequētly you may consider of the truth of his promise and vaunt made in the entrance to this Chapter, to wit, that he would giue such satisfaction, as that not only the wound of slander may be cured, but euen also the s
                        •
                     spicious scars of imputation wiped away. Thus he promised then, but now for lacke of performance, both scarres & wounds are renewed, & deeply impressed, as will appeare more euidently by the ensuing Chapter, which is to lay downe a very pittifull list of many scarres & wounds left vncured by him, that is to say many grieuous charges of vntrue dealing, that were obiected vnto him, & vrged by his aduersary, are now wholy pretermitted, concealed, & dissembled by him in this his Answer, whē most effectually he should haue sought to heale them.

Let vs run ouerthen if you please some nūber of other falshoods obiected to him by me (for that to resume & discusse all would aske a seueral Treatise) which are cōcealed by him in this his answere.

                     nd purpose to disobay or contradict the Church, but it is inough that he do contradict the same re ipsa, indeed,

knowing that opinion which he defendeth to be against the authority of the sayd vniuersall Church, albeit he be not induced to this belief with a direct will to impugne the Church, but either by desyre of glorie or other inducement: so as indeed the malice of this sinne is consummated in the vnderstanding, and not in the will.
                  5. This is the dis
                        •
                     ourse and doctrine of Vasquez in this place about the nature and essence of Heresie, wherin he doth not exclude either the vnderstanding or will, but includeth them both expresly: for that as there must be knowledg, which apperteyneth to the mynd or vnderstanding: so must there be choice with obstinacie, which belongeth to the will and affection: but his scholasticall consideration is, in which of these two powers of our soule this synne of heresy receaueth her consummation. For better explication wherof, let vs vse this example.
                  6. If a man should hold or belieue an erroneous proposition contrary to the doctrine of the Catholicke Church: as for example, that there were but one nature in Christ, not knowing yt to be against the Catholicke Church, yt were false in yt selfe, and an errour in his vnderstanding,How heresy is consummated in the vnderstanding and not in the will. but not Heresy, except also by act of his will, he should choose to hold it with resolution and obstinacy euen after that he knoweth the same to be against the doctrine of the said Church: for then this knowledg (saith Vasques) that it is against the Church, maketh it perfect and consummate Heresy: albeit the matter passe not to a further act of will, to wit, that he chooseth expresly to contradict the authority of the Church therin, which should be a greater synne, but yet is not necessary, for that the perfect nature of heresy is consummated, by knowing that it is against the

Church. And for that this notice or knowledg belongeth to the vnderstanding, therfore Vasquez holdet
                        •
                      that the last perfection or consummation of this synne is in the vnderstanding, and not in the will, not meaning to exclude therby obstinacie of the will (as ignorantly T.M. doth when he sayth, VVe

Augustine to Honoratus:

Morton at that tyme, and yt was a great Charge as yow see, and more earnestly pressed then diuers of these other smaller matters, which in the former Chapter he singled out to answere, though as you haue heard he professeth the contrary. But why said he nothing to this, seing it hath more difficulty in it, then many other layd togeather? Surely no other so probable cause can be alleaged, as the difficulty made him to flie the endeauour of answering it. But let vs see some others, of not much vnlike quality to this.

                  M. Morton plaieth his pageant thus. What obstinate? It may be, some do but doubtingly defend it, what will yow iudge of these?
Wherunto he answereth out of Azor: If he doubt therof willingly, he is certainly an hereticke. But by our Ministers leaue Azor addeth more.Azor corrupted.

to submit his iudgment, when he shalbe instructed in the truth, incurreth not heresie at all. So as heere the most substantiall word is left out, and craftily conueyed away by our deuider of tongues, wherby the Author is made to say the quite opposyte to that he sayth and protesteth.
               
               11. These were my words at that tyme. And now let the iudicious Reader iudge, what cause I had to complaine as I did, and yet got no satisfaction of M. Morton at all, though the title of his former booke was a full Satisfaction: and this later Preamble was cast out for a supply or complement to the said Satisfaction. Did not this obiection deserue to be satisfyed before diuers other trifles, wherwith you haue heard him now to fill vp paper, and intertaine his Reader? Let vs go forward.
            
            
               THE THIRD Pretermitted falshood by Thomas Morton. §. III.
               
               AND for that we haue begone to talke of Azor,
                  Azor peruerted about the Case of Couētry. whome M. Morton some tymes will seeme highly to esteeme, wee shall cyte an example or two of his abuse towards him, which is s

                  cted, in these wordes.
               13. The first Case shalbe (quoth I) that which our Mynister so often proposeth, and odiously doth exaggerate about Couentry, saying:

                        y intending to aske him concerning a place infected he may answere, no. For that herin he deceiueth not the mynd of the questioner, but answereth directly to his intention. So propoundeth he the Case, as he pretendeth, out of the Catholicke Treatise of Equiuocation, which hitherto I haue not seene, and consequently cannot affirme, how truly or falsely the same is related: but he hauing so vttered the said Case, doth in opposition therof cyte the foresaid Iesuite Azor his sentence against this, as though he said, that if we admit this Case:

Morton hath perfidiously heere tyed them togeather: but Azor speaking twice of this our Case in one page, first in the name of others by way of obiection, and againe in his owne name by way of resolution, he saith:

And before him this Case was resolued by

                  Doctor Syluester, Nauar, Tolet, Roderiquez, Cosmus Philiarchus and diuers other learned men:
                     Syl Verb. Iuramentum 3. q. 2. Nauar. in Manual c. 12. nu 196. as after him also by our often named Countrey man Gregorius Sayer: and the reason of the lawfulnes of this answere is, for that the answere being sure, that either the place is not infected from whence he came, or that himselfe hath brought no infection about him (for otherwise he should be periured) it were great iniurie vnto him to be staied at the gate wit

And therefore for declyning this iniurie and iniustice, it is lawfull for him to answere to the finall end and intention of the keeper, and of the Citty or Common wealth (whose intention only is to exclude infected people) and not to their immediate words about the particuler place.
               
                  14. And now all this being so, cōsider, I praie yow (said I) the shamelesse forehead of this deceauing Minister, in citing Azor quite against himselfe, and his owne sense and meaning: and tying his wordes togeather that were spoken separately to another end: and yet as though he had played no such iugling tricke, but had gotten some victory ouer vs, heare his insolent speach about this answere, set downe by so many learned men as yow haue heard named.Egregiou

Let the Reader be iudge betweene vs. He sayth in the beginning of his precedent Chapter, that he tooke vpon him to answer, not such points as were easiest to answere, but such as I most insisted vpō: which you see to be false in both points. Let vs passe to others.
            
            
               THE FOVRTH Pretermitted falshood by M. Morton. §. IIII.
               THERE followeth another falshood vsed against the same Author Azor,
                  Azor falsyfied as reiecting a Case which he plainely alloweth. Exod. 20. more notable perhaps  thē any of the former: & thus by me expressed in my Treatise of Mitigation: where hauing shewed how impertinētly M. Mortō
                   had produced a place of Exodus, to wit, Thou shalt not beare false witnesse, to proue that euery mentall Equiuocation was a lye, I went forward with this speach.
               
                  17. But harken further (quoth I) for that M. Morton will bring another proo

                     Your great Moralist Azor (saith he) doth condemne all Equiuocators herin (to wit for mentall Equiuocation in an Oath) as periured lyars, or otherwise (sayth he) there is nothing in an Oath, that may not be affirmed and denied without a lye.
                     
                        Pag. 60. & 61. Thus he. And I would demaund M. Mortō
                      about this matter, whether he will sweare this to be true which he sayth of Azor?
                     Azor notably belied by T. Morton. For if Ministers & Priests go in equall ranke in England, a Mynisters word ought to be equall to an Oath: as a Priests

word, laying his hand on his brest, is with vs: and then must I needs cōclude Tho. Morton

                  Some haue thought it lawfull (sayth he) to euery man, for the conseruation of his life to sweare to his enemy only in that sense which he conceiueth inwardly in his owne mynd, which if it should be graunted, then might we by this meanes deny anything, & speake what we will without a lye.

For that he hauing proposed the Case first vnder other learned mens names, much after the sense as here is set down by M. Mortō, he commeth at length to resolue, and approue the same in his owne name saying: quare libenter concedimus id quod paulò ante dicebatur de co, qui, vt se saluum tueatur, promittit latroni, Tyrano, aut hosti, daturum se illi pecuniae quantitatē &c.

to condemne that as lying periury, which he doth not onlie allow, as truth, and no lye; but proueth also the lawfulnes therof by many examples, and especially by this of him that sweareth by Equiuocation, which example M. Morton bringeth in as condemned by Azor for periurious lying. What will you say? or what will you do with such men? And do you note also that in the former words of Azor he cutteth of La

Morton to haue yelded vs some peece of answere, if he had pleased, or had thought himselfe able: Wherunto he was specially bound, for that in the precedent Chapter, as you haue heard, he cyted Azor for one of his three Iesuits that condēne all Equiuocation: but it semeth that he careth litle what he saith in one place, so he may scape out in another, where he is most pressed. And yet after all this in the very end of his book, he maketh new Chalēges of sincere integrity, as freshly, as if he hadneuer bene taken in the turnings, windings, and contradictions, which now you haue heard and wondered at, I doubt not.

               THE SIXT Pretermitted falshood by Thomas Morton. §. VI.
               AFTER Cardinall Tolet may succeed Bellarmine of the same dignity, and of no lesse fame for learning and vertue, whome as you haue heard him  abused before by M. Morton in the precedent Chapter (though he wēt about to excuse it:Cardinall Bellarm. egregiously iniured about the question of ancient gathering of Councells.) so more notably shall yow see it heere, which I insisted vpon so earnestly, moued with the indignity of the abuse, as I cannot but maruaile, that M. Morton with any credit could pretermit to answere somewhat therunto. My words are these:
               
                  26. But yet in the very next page after, he vseth a farre greater immodestie, or rather per
                        •
                     idie in my opiniō, in calūniation of Cardinall Bellarmine,
                     
                        Mitig. pa. 208. whom he abuseth both in allegatiō, translatiō, application, and vayne insultation: for thus he citeth in his text out of him. Ancient generall Councells (sayth the Romish Pretence) were not gathered without the cost of good and Christian Emperours, and were made by their consents. For in those dayes, the Popes did make supplication to the Emperours, that by his authority he would gather Synods: but after those tymes all causes were changed, because the Pope, who is Head in spirituall matters, cannot be subiect in temporall. Bellarm. lib. 1. de Concil. c. 13. §. Habemus ergo.
                  27. And hauing alledged this resolution of Bellarmine, the Minister insulteth ouer him in these words
                        •
                      Who would think this man could be a Papist, much lesse a Iesuite, how much lesse a Cardinall, who

thus disableth the title of the Pope, granting to vs in these words: After these tymes (that is a

                     ter six hundred yeares) the truth of purer antiquities challenging Popes to be subiect vnto Christian Emperours. And yet who but a Papist would (as it were in despite of antiquity) defend the degenerate state, saying: After those tymes Popes might not be subiect in temporall matters? as if he should haue sayd:A childish insultatiō of T. M. ouer Card. Bellarm.
                      
                     Thou gracious fauour of ancient Christian Emperours: Thou sound iudgment of ancient reuerend Fathers: Thou deuout subiection of ancient holy Popes: in summe, Thou ancient purity and pure antiquity, adieu. But we may not so bastardly reiect the depositum and doctrine of humble subiection, which we haue receiued from our Fathers of the first six hundred yeares: and not so only, but which (as your Barkley witnesseth) the vniuersall Christian world imbraced with common consent for a full thousand yeares. So he.

                      & Chapter cyted and he will wonder at the impudency of this vaunter: for he speaketh no one word of gathering Councells, or comparison of spirituall authority betweene the Pope and Emperour, concerning their gathering of Councells or Synods: but of a quite different subiect, of taking armes by subiects against their lawfull temporall Princes. And what will our Minister then answere to this manifest calumniation so apparently conuinced out of D. Barkley? But let vs passe to the view of that which toucheth Cardinall Bellarmine, against whom all this tempest is raised.

Then in those daies generall Councells were made not without the charges of Emperours, and in that tyme the Pope did subiect himselfe vnto Emperours in temporall affaires, and therefore they could do nothing against the Emperours will: for which cause the Pope did make supplication to the Emperour, that he would commaund Synods to be gathered: but after those tymes al

                  30. And here let vs cōsider the varietie of 
                        •
                     leights and shifts of this our Mynister, not only in cyting Bellarmynes wordes falsely and against his meaning and drift in Latin,Diuers sorts of corruptiō. wherof we shall speake presently: but in peruerting this Latin, that he hath so corruptly set downe in his former English translatiō. For first hauing said according to the latin, that generall Councells in these daies were not gathered without the cost of Emperours, he addeth presently of his owne, & were made by their consents, which is not in the Latin: & then he cutteth of the other words immediatly ensuing which conteine the cause, to wit, for that the Popes subiecting themselues in those dayes touching temporalities vnto the Emperours (as hauing no temporall States or dominion yet of their owne) could do nothing without them, and therefore did make supplication to the said Emperours,

that they would cōmaund Synods to be gathered: which T.M. translateth that they would gather Synods, as though Bellarmine did affirme, that it lay in the Emperours by right to do it: but after those tymes omnes causae mutatae sunt, all causes were changed: but he should haue said are changed, as Bellarmyns true words are, omnes istae causae, all these causes are changed, to wit, foure sortes of causes, which he setteth downe why generall Councells could not be well gathered in those dayes without the Emperours help and authority, with causes are guilfully cut of by this deceiuer, as in like manner the last words put downe here by himselfe, Pontifex non est subiectus in temporalibus, are falsely translated, cannot be subiect in temporall. And againe afterward, Popes might not be subiect in temporall matters, which is to make Bellarmine contrary to himselfe, who saith a litle b
                        •
                     fore, that the Popes did subiect themselues for many yeares: wherby is proued that they could do it. But Bellarmyns meaning is, that in right by the prehemynence of their spirituall dignity, they were exempted and not bound therunto.
                  31. And thus much now for the corruptions vsed in the words heere set downe both in Latin and English. But if we would go to Bellarmyne himselfe, and see his whole discourse, and how brokenly & perfidiously these lynes are cut out of him and heere patched togeather, as one entire context, contrary to his drift and meaning
                        •
                      we shall maruaile more at the insolencie of Tho. Morton, tryumphing ouer his owne lye, as before hath byn sayd. For that Bellarmyne hauing proued at large,The summe of Cardinall Bellarmins discourse falsifyed by

                        . M. and by many sortes of arguments and demonstrations, throughout diuers Chapters togeather, that the right of gathering generall Councells belongeth only to the B. of Rome, and hauing answered all obiections that could be

made against the same in the behalfe of Emperours or other temporall Princes, granting only that for certaine causes in those first ages, the same could not be done (in respect of temporall difficulties) without the help and assistance of the said Emperours, that were Lords of the world; he commeth to make this conclusiō, which heere is cyted by T. M. but in farre other words and meaning then here he is cyted. Yow shall heare how he setteth it downe, and therupon consider of the truth of this Mynister.
                        Bellar. l. 1. de Conc. c. 13. § Habemus ergo. 
                     Habemus ergo (sayth he) prima illa Concilia &c. Wee haue then by all this disputation seene, how those first Christian Councells were commanded by Emperours to be gathered, but by the sentence and consent of Popes, and why the Pope alone in those dayes did not call Councells, as afterward hath byn accustomed:
                        Athan. in. Ep. ad solitar. vit. agentes.
                      the reason was
                        •
                      not for that Councells gathered without the Emperours cōsēt, are not lawful, as our aduersaries would haue it, for against that is the expresse authority of S. Athanasius, saying: Quā
                        do vnquā iudicium Ecclesiae ab Imperatore authoritatem habuit? When was it euer seene that the iudgment of the Church did take authority from the Emperour? But for many other most iust causes was the Emperours consent required therin &c.
               
               So Bellarmyne.
               
               32. And heere now see,Foure causes why Emperours consents were necessary for gathering of Councells in old time. that Bellarmins drift is wholy against M. Mortons assertion: for that he denieth that euer the Emperours had any spirituall authority for calling of Councells, but only that they could not well in those daies be made without them, and that for foure seuerall causes: wherof the first was for that the old Imperiall lawes made by Gentills were yet in vse, wherby all great meetings of people were forbidden, for feare of sedition, except by the Emperours knowledge and  license. The second, for that Emperours being temporall

                     •

                   The third, for that generall Councells being made in those daies by the publike charges and contributions of Cytties, and especially of Christian Emperours themselues, as appeareth by Eusebius,  Theodoretus,
                  
                     Euseb. l. 3. de vit. Cōst. Th

                        od. l. 1. Hist. c. 16. and other writers, it was necessary to haue their consent and approbation in so publike an action, as that was.
               
                  33. The fourth and last cause was (sayth Bellarmine) for that in those dayes, albeit the B. of Rome were Head in spirituall matters ouer the Emperours  themselues: yet in temporall a
                        •
                     fairs he did subiect himselfe vnto them, as hauing no temporall State of his owne; and therefore acknowleging them to be his temporall Lords, he did make supplication vnto them to commaund Synods to be gathered by their authority and licence. At post illa tempora istae omnes caus
                           •
                         mutatae sunt: But since those dayes all these (foure) causes are changed, & ipse in suis Prouincijs est Princeps supremus temporalis, sicut sunt Reges & Principes alij. And the Pope himselfe now in his temporall Prouinces is supreme temporall Lord also, as other Kings and Princes are: which was brought to pas
                        •
                     e by Gods prouidence (sayth Bellarmyne) to the end, that he might with more freedome, liberty & reputatiō exercise his office of generall Pastourship.
                  34. And this is all that Bellarmyne hath of this matter. And now may we consider the vanity of M. Mortons triumph ouer him be
                        •
                     ore, and how falsely he dealeth with him, alleaging him against his owne drift and meaning: leauing out also those foure causes by mer
                        •
                      cited, & then cutting of frauduiently the particle (istae) these causes are now changed, which includeth reference to these foure: and furthermore speaking indefinitely, as though

                     ll causes, and matters were now changed, seeketh therby to deceaue his Reader, and to extort from Bellarmyne that confession of antiquity on his syde, which he neuer meant, and much lesse vttered in his writings. What dealing, what conscience, what truth is this? &c.
               
               35. Thus I insisted then: and was not this sufficient to draw some answere from M Morton, if he had resolued to answere the points of most moment and most insisted vpon, as he professeth? But it shameth me to see him thus taken at euery turne. Let vs go forward,

for the beginnyng of that Religious Order: in which citation diuers notable corruptions are to be seene. First, for that Salmeron proueth the quite contrary in the place by this man quoted, to wit, that neuer Kings were Head of the Church or aboue Priests by their ordinary Kingly authority in Ecclesiasticall matters in the new or old Testament: and hauing proued the same largely, he commeth at length to set downe obiections to the contrary, and to 
                        •
                     olue and answere them saying:
                        Salmeron disp. 12. in Ep. Pauli in gen. §. Sed cōtra. 
                     Sed contra hanc solidam veritatem &c. But now against this sound truth by me hitherto cōfirmed I know that many things may be obiected, which we are diligētly to confute. First thē may be obiected that Kings in the old Testament did sometymes prescribe vnto Priests, what they were to do in sacred things, as also did put some negligēt Priests frō the executiō of their office. To which is answered: Vbi id euenisset, mirum esse non debere: If it had so fallen out, yt had byn no meruaile: for that the Synagogue of the Iewes, albeit it conteyned some iust men, yet was it called rather an earthly then 
                        •
                     n heauenly Kingdome: in so much as S. Augustine doth doubt,
                        Aug. l. 19. cōt. Faust. cap. 31. in princ.
                      whether in the old Testament, the Kingdome of heauen was euer so much as named, and much lesse promised for reward: and therfore those things that were then done among them, foreshewed only or prefigured diuine things that were to succeed vnder the new Testament, the other being not diuine but humane and earthly.
So Salmeron.
               
               
                  
                     Corruption about the meaning.38. Here then are sundrie important corruptions and frauds vttered by T. M. the one that the Iesuits and namely Salmeron are in
                        •
                     orced to allow the temporall King to haue byn supreme ouer the high Priest in spirituall matters, vnder the old law: whereas he doth expressely affirme and proue the

contrary, both out of the Scripture it selfe, by the sacrifice appointed more worthy for the Priest, thē the Prince, and many other Testimonies,
                        Disp. 12. pag. 324. & 325. Leuit. 4. Deut. 17. Num. 27. Philo. l. de victimis par. 2. circa med. Ioseph l. 3. antiq. cap. 10. as that he must take the law and interpretation therof at the Priests hands, that he must ingredi & egredi ad verbum Sacerdotis, go in and out, and proceed in his affaires by the word & direction of the Priest, and the like: as also by the testimonie of Philo and Iosephus two learned Iewes: and other reasons handled at large in this very disputation, and in the selfe same place from whence this obiection is taken. And this is the first falsyfication concerning the Authors meaning and principall drift.
               
               
                  39. The secōd corruptiō is in the words as they ly in the latin copy, & as by me before mentioned:Corruption about the words 
                     Vbi id euenisset mirū esse non debere. If any such thing had fallē out as was obiected, to wyt, that Kings sometimes had prescribed to the Priests what they should do in Ecclesiasticall things, deposed some &c. yt had byn no maruaile: for so much as their Ecclesiasticall Kingdome or Synagogue was an earthly & imperfect thing, but yet this proueth not that it was so, but only it is spoken vpō a suppositiō: which suppositiō this Minister that he might the more cūningly shift of and auoid, left out of purpose the most essentiall words therof, vbi id euenisset, if that had happened &c. as also for the same cause to make things more obscure, after those words of Salmeron that stand in his text, Synagoga Iud

                        orum dicebatur terrenū potiùs quàm caeleste regnum: The Synagogue or Ecclesiasticall gouerment of the Iewes was called rather an earthly then an heauenly Kingdome (where as contrarywise the Ecclesia

                     ticall power in the Christian Church is euery where called Celestiall:) after those words (I say) this man cutteth of againe many lynes that followed

                     ly preuaile among the Iewes: and herewith endeth, as though nothing more had ensued of that matter, thrusting out these words, that imediatly followed, & made the thing cleare, which are: Et ad spiritualia significanda constituebatur: & that kind of earthly power was appointed to signify the spirituall, that was to be in the new Testament: Wherby is euidētly seene that Salmeron vnderstood not by carnalis pars, and regnum terrenum, the temporall Kingdome of Iury, as this Mynister doth insinuate to make the matter odious: but the Ecclesiasticall gouerment of the Sinagogue vnder the old law, in respect of the Ecclesiasticall power in the new, wherof the other was but an earthly figure or signification.
               
               40. But now the third corruption,Corruption about the translation. Confut. pag. 2. and most egregious of all is in his English Translation out of the Latin words of Salmeron: for thus he translateth them in our name:

                     In the Synagogue of the Iewes (sayth Salmeron) was a State rather earthly then heauenly: so that in that people (which was as in the body of a man, consisting of body and soule) the carnall part was more emynent: meaning the temporall to haue byn supreme. In which translation are many seuerall shiftes & frauds. For where as Salmeron sayth: Synagoga Iudaeorum dicebatur potiùs terrenum, quàm caeleste regnum. The Synagogue or Ecclesiasti
                           •
                        all power among the Iewes was called rather an earthly, th
                           •
                        n a heauenly Kingdome: he translateth yt: The Synagogue of the Iewes was a State, rather earthly then heauenly. And

this, to the end he might apply the word of eart
                           •
                        
                      to the temporall Prince,Malicious interpretations to make vs odious. and heauenly to the Iudaicall Priests, which is quite from Salmerons meaning. Secondly those other words of Salmeron being, Cùm populus Dei constet ex corpore & animo: VVhere as the people of God do consist of body and mynd, meaning therby aswell Christians as Iewes: and that the Iewes are as the bodily or carnall part of the man, and the Christians the spirituall, and consequently their Ecclesiasticall authority earthly, and ours heauenly: this fellow to deceiue his reader putteth out first the word (Dei) the people of God, which could not but signify Christians in Salmerons meaning, and then translateth, In that people (to wit the Iewes) the carnall part was the more eminent, meaning (sayth he) the temp
                           •
                        
                        rall: which is fals
                        •
                     , for he speaketh expresly of the Ecclesiasticall power among the Iewes, which he calleth carnall and terrene, in respect of the spirituall Ecclesiasticall among the Christians, and not the temporall or kingly power vnder the old Testamēt, as this man to make vs odious to temporall Princes as debasing their authority would haue it thought. And Salmerons contraposition or antithesis is not betweene the temporall and Ecclesiasticall gouerment among the 
                        •
                     ewes: but betwene their Ecclesiasticall gouernment and ours, that of the Synagogue, and this of the Christian Church, wherof the one (he sayth) to be terrene and earthly, the other spirituall and heauenly: the one infirme, the other powerfull ouer soules &c. So as all these sortes and kinds of corruptiōs being seene in this one litle authority, you may imagine what wilbe found in the whole Booke, if a man had so much patience and time to leese, as to discusse the same exactly throughout.
So in that place. And did not this require some answere also among the rest? Had it not bene good

                  ent vs some few lines of satisfactiō to this, insteed of so many idle triflings, as he hath prosecuted largely in this his Reply? But it is easily seene, that he sought for choice matter, wherby to intertayne his reader, and seeme to say somewhat.

               42. Let it be so, that the old Testament was in many thinges a figure of the heauenly Sabboth

                  igure also of many things vpō earth, which should be fulfilled in the new Testament?How the old Testament was a figure of the new.
                  Were not their Cerimonies and Sacrifices a figure of our Sacramēts & Sacrifice? their Manna of our Eucharist? their Circumcisions and washings figures of our Baptisme? doth not S. Paul in the 9. an 10. of his first Epistle to the Corinthians set downe many examples to this effect? as that of Deutronomy, Non alligabis os boui trituranti:1. Cor. 9.
                     
                        Deut. 25. thou shalt not bynd vp the mouth of the oxe that laboureth, applying it vnto our Preachers of the new Testament that must haue their maintenance? as also he expoundeth the passing of the Red-sea by the Israelits, their being baptized in the Cloud, their food of the Manna, their drinking out of the Rocke which prefigured Christ, and diuers other things, wherof he sayth: Haec autem in figura facta sunt nostri: these things were done in figure of our present St

                     te. And againe: Haec autem omnia in figura contingebant illis:
                     1. Cor. 10. All these things did happen to the Iewes in figure, but were to be fullfilled truly and really according to the spirituall meaning in the new Testament Is not all this so? Were not these things to be fulfilled aswell vpon earth as in heauen? How then doth our Mynister put that aduersatiue clause (but of the truly heauenly,) as though the old Testament in her earthly elements had pre
                        •
                     igured nothing to be fulfilled but only in heauē? Is this sound Diuinity? Is this Manhood? Nay is it not rather babish Childhood, that semeth not to know the very first elements of true Diuinity?
               
               
                  43. I let passe the shameles corruption which he vseth in translating the very words cyted by him out of Salmeron, for proofe of his obiection made in our behalfe: and I call yt shameles, for that euery

Child which vnderstandeth Latyn may see the Ministers shift therin. The Authors words are these as this man here recounteth them: Et hoc regnum terrenum vmbra tamen suit spiritualis regiminis in Ecclesia Christiana:
                        Confut. pa. 
                        
                           ••
                        
                      and yet this earthly Kingdome (of the Iewes) was a shaddow of the spirituall gouerment, that was to be in the Christian Church: meaning therby the most excellent spirituall power and gouerment ouer soules, which Christ was to institute in his Church, at his comming in flesh, to wit, the power of absoluing from synnes vpon earth, the assistance giuen by the Sacraments, and the like, were shadowed in a certaine manner by the earthly Ecclesiasticall Kingdome among the Iewes. And how doth T. M. now translate these wordes and frame our obiection out of them. The old Testament (sayth he) was a figure of the new in Christ, therfore in the new, the Popedome is the substantiue &c. Here are two short propositions you see, the Antecedent & Consequent, and both framed with falshood: for that the Antecedent set downe, as out of Salmeron, is not that which he affirmeth in his Latin words, as already we haue shewed: though otherwise in it selfe the proposition be true, to wit, that the old Testament was a figure of the new in Christ: nor will (I thinke) T. M. denie it. There followeth then the Consequent or second proposition (that therefore in the new the Popedome is the substantiue) which is no lesse corruptly inferred in our name,Cauillatiō of T.M. then was the Antecedent affirmed: for that we do not inferre, nor yet the Author Carerius in the said second propositiō or Cō
                     sequence by him alleaged, that for so much as the old Testament is a figure of the new, therefore in the new, the Popes spirituall authority is the substantiue &c. for that this were a weake inference, as euery man seeth. Nay Carerius maketh no inferēce

at all in the place by him alleaged, but only vseth that similitude, which before you haue heard of the substantiue and adiectiue: So as this inference is only a fiction of the Minister to make himselfe & other men merry, and to giue occasion to play vpon his aduersarie, with reproach of Childhood and babish grammer, as now he hath done: but indeed the true Consequence that may be made vpon the Catholicke Authors words which hitherto he hath alleaged, is only this: that for so much as the Kingdome and gouerment among the Iewes, euen in Ecclesiasticall things, was but earthly, and a figure or shadow, in respect of that which was to be ouer soules, in the Christian Church, it followeth, that this in respect of spirituality was to be much more emynent then the other, as the thing figured, then the figure or shadow it selfe. And what inconuenience hath this doctrine that it should be called Childhood and babish grammer?
                  
So much I set downe in my former reprehension of M. Morton for this abuse of Salmeron, all which he now in his last Reply thought best to passe ouer with sylence: for that belike he esteemed it not sufficiently insisted vpon by me, therby to presse him to answere it. But this may be amended at another tyme: and so I passe on now to recount others of like sort.
            
            
               THE NINTH Pretermitted falshood by Thomas Morton. §. IX.
               THERE followeth now against Dolman a like sleight, thus recorded by me in my booke.

                  
                  M. Mortons second reason why his Maiesties Catholicke & Protestant subiects may not liue togeather in England is:About Dolman and other writers abused by him. 
                  For that all Popish Priests (sayth he) d
                        •
                      attribute a double prerogatiue ouer Kings, that is to say, a Democraticall and Monarchicall soueraigne Ciuill power: the first to the people, the second to the Pope.
                  And for proofe of the first concerning the people, he alleageth foure seueral authorities of Catholick wryters,
                        Mitig. pag 65. but so corruptly & perfidiously, as if nothing els did shew his talent of cogging & treacherous dealing, this were sufficient to discouer the same: though afterwards greater store will occure, we shall runne ouer briefly all those foure.
               
               45. First he saith that Dolman in his Con
                        •
                     erence about Succession hath these words: The common wealth hath authority to choose a King, and to lymit him lawes at their pleasure:
                  
                     Dolman. par. 1. pag. 13. 
                        
                           •
                        yted in Discou. pag. 9. which if it were truly alleadged, as it lieth in the Author, yet here is no mention o
                        •
                      the people, or of Democraticall state, but only of the Common wealth, which includeth both nobility and people, and all other States.
Secondly Dolmans words are not of choosing a King, but of choosing a forme of gouerment, be it Democraticall, Aristocraticall, or Monarchicall. Let vs heare the Author himselfe speake. In lyke mā

                           •
                        ions shee pleaseth: wherof ensueth great diuers

                        ormer gouerments hath in it selfe. So he. Where we see that Doleman speaketh of the power which a Common wealth that is deuoid of any certaine gouerment, to chuse vnto themselues that forme that best liketh thē, with the limitatiōs they thinke most expedient: & so we see in Engla

with different lawes and lymitations, according to the choice and liking of ech Nation.
This  place then of Dolman is corrupted by T. M. both in words and sense.About Dolman
                        •
                      text abused in words & sense. For he neither speaketh nor meaneth as the false Minister auoucheth him, of gyuing Democraticall power to the people ouer Princes established.
               46. So wrote I in my former booke. And albeit I do not insist and dwell vpon the matter so long as vpon some other sleights: yet doth it conteine notable falshood, yf yow consider it well; first to alleage the words of an Author that are not his: and thē to inferre therof, that, which neither the words thēselues do beare, nor the Author euer dreamed of.
               47. And here I might alleage diuers other Wryters, but especially Iesuits wrongfully abused by him, both in cyting of their works and words, and falsifying their meaning: as namely those three whome he bringeth in for witnes in the end of the fourth Chapter against Equiuocation, euen in those places, where they do most resolutely affirme Equiuocation to be lawfull: namely Azor, Emanuel Sà, & Maldonatus: but these will haue their place afterward. And so from Iesuits I passe to other Authors, who haue receiued the like sort of dealing from him.
            
            
               THE TENTH Pretermitted falshood by Thomas Morton. §. X.
               AS you haue heard how M. Morton hath dealt fraudulently with the Iesuits, so shall you see him vse the same measure also towards others, as

namely toward the Paduan Doctor Carerius,

                     le. But now you shal heare a more graue and grieuous charge made against him for worse abusing of the same Carerius. Thus it lyeth in my booke.
               49. The next sentence (quoth I) or obiection after the former preface (which is the very first of his discourse) is framed by him (but yet in our name) vnder the title of the Roman pretence in these words.

                     The high Priests in the old

                     teth in of his owne, and if you marke them, do marre the whole market. For that Carerius hath them not either in words or sense, but teacheth the plaine cō
                     trary in all his discourse, to wit, that he meaneth in matters appertayning to Religion and Priesthood, & not of temporall Principality: which temporall principality this Author granteth to haue byn greater in the old Testament in dealing with Ecclesiasticall men and matters, then in the new: and to that effect is he cited presently after by the Mynister himselfe, contrary to that which here he feigneth him to say. But let vs heare the words of Carerius. Tertiò dico (saith he) etiam in Testamento vete

                     so in the old Testament then the King: which is proued first out of the 27. Chapter of Numbers, where it is appointed by God, that Iosue, and all the people should be directed by the word of the high Priest Eleazar, saying:The dignity of Priesthood proued to be more the
                           •
                         Regall. Whē any thing is to be done, let Eleazar the high Priest cōsult with God, & at his word aswell Iosue, as all the Children of Israell, and whole multitude shall go forth and come in &c. And secondly the same is proued out of the fourth of Leuiticus, where foure kind of Sacrifices being ordayned according to the dignity of the persons: the first two are of a Calse for the high Priest and Common wealth: the third and fourth of a hee and shee-goat for the Prince and priuate persons. Wherby Carerius inferreth a most certaine dignitie and preheminence of the Priestes state aboue the temporall Prince, though he say not in Ciuil causes, as this Mynister doth bely him.
               
               
                  50. And whereas Carerius had sayd in two former answers, first that in the old Testament, Ecclesiasticall and secular iurisdiction were not so distinct but that both might be in some Cases in the King: & secōdly that in the law, the new spirituall power was more emynēt thē in the old, he cōmeth thirdly to say, that in the old law, the high Priest in some respects was greater also then the King, which cannot be vnderstood of Ciuill

                        iū adiectiuū &c. That in the old Law the Kingdome was the substātiue that

stood of it selfe, and Priesthood was the adiectiue that leaned theron: but contrarywise in the new law, Priesthood and spirituall iurisdiction is the substantiue or principall in gouernment, and temporall principality is the adiectiue depending therof for direction and assistance: the one, both by nature, and Gods law being subordinate to the other, to wit, the temporall to the spirituall. And thus much concerning this guyle by flat falshood. Now to a tricke or two of other sortes of shifting, by him vsed for deluding the Reader.
               
               51. This was my reprehension and complaint then, and if M. Morton had dealt really, he would rather haue thought how to haue answered somewhat to this substantiall imputation, then to haue trif

               54. Secondly, if we consider either the English translation heere set downe out of the words of Victoria,
                  Variety of corruptions. or his Latin text for ostentation sake put in the margent by M. Morton; we shall find so many & monstrous foule corruptions, intercisions, geldings and mutilations, as is a shame to behold:

For that Victoria hauing set downe his precedent

generall proposition for the exemption of Clergy men,Victoria his propositions about exemption of Clergy men, and and

                        •
                     st de iure diuino: that some kind of exemptions of Clergy men from Ciuill power, is by diuine law, and not humane only: and fourthly he commeth to this which here is set downe by T.M. but not as he setteth it downe.

                     Our 
                           •
                        ourth proposition (saith Victoria) is that the persons of Clergy men are not absolutely and in all things exempted from Ciuill power,

                  55. These are the words of Victoria, as they lye togeather in him, and then after some arguments interposed for his sayd conclusion, he addeth also this proofe. That 
                           •
                        or so much as Clergy men besides this that they are Mynisters of the Church, are Cittizens also of the common wealth, they are bound to obey the temporall lawes of that Common wealth or Prince in temporall affaires: and then ensueth the last reason (here set downe in English by T. M.) in th

                     hese very words. And let any man consider the patching, which T. M. vseth both in English and Latin in this place, to make some shew for his feygned demonstration out of Victoria, and he will see how poore and miserable a man he is, and how miserable a cause he defendeth. And in particuler, let the very last proposition be noted which he cyteth and Englisheth, as out of victoria, to wit, the Clergy is subiect to th

                        or such matter is not ruled by any power spirituall: wherby he would haue his Reader to imagine, that no spirituall power may haue authority to gouerne temporall matters: whereas the words of Victoria are: Clerici quantum ad temporalia non administrantur potestate Ecclesiastica, that Clergy men 
                           •
                        or so much as apperteineth to temporall affaires, are not gouerned by Ecclesiasticall power, but by the temporall, which there beareth rule. So as this fellow by a subtile sleight changing the nominatiue Case from Clerici non administrantur, to temporalia non administrantur, frameth his plaine Demonstration out of plaine cosenage and forgerie.
And is this naked innocency &c? Thus farre I had in my former Treatise. And heere you see, I was earnest inough in vrging & pressing for an answere, if it might haue byn had: but none came at all, but other trifling toyes in steed therof: and that in great store, as our former discourses, haue declared: and yet we must go forward to recount more

                     . Boniface Archb. falsifyed notably in the question, Whether a Pope may be an hereticke. whome M. Morton seemeth to make a Pope also, for that his speach is alleadged in one of the Popes Constitutions. My former charge against M. Morton about that matter, was this that ensueth.
               57. Now (sayd I) to the second, wherin he sayth, that one of our Popes placed also in the Calends of our Martyrs, doth affirme, that though a Pope should carrie many people with himselfe to hell, no mortall man may presume to say, why do you so?

                  I do greatly maruaile with what conscience, or if not conscience, with what forehead at least, these men can write and print, and reiterate so often in their bookes, things that they know, or may know, to be meerly fa

Is not this a signe of obstinate wilfulnes, and that neither God nor truth is sought for by them, but only to mainteine a part or faction with what sleight or falshood so euer? I fynd this very obiection set forth in print not many yeares agone by Syr Francis Hastings in his Watchword and Defence therof,Shamles facing of vntruthes and the same auouched stoutly after him for a tyme by Matthew Sutclisse the Mynister, Aduocate and Proctour of that De

                        re, though good roundly to let it passe without any answere at all, which I can find in his said booke, though I haue vsed some diligence in search therof: which I do adde, for that he changeth the whole order of answering, from the method of his Aduersary, to the end not to be found: and so answereth nothing in order or place, as it is set downed by him, whom he pretēdeth to answere, but rather taking a new, vast, and wild discourse to himself,A note of M. Sutcliffs manner of answering. snatcheth here a word and there a word to carp at, not as they lye in his Aduersaries booke, but as it pleaseth him to admit them, now from the end of the booke, then from the beginning, then from the myddle. And with this substantiall method he taketh vpon him to answere all books that come in his way: for so he hath answered of late the booke also of Three Conuersions of England, and may do easely all that is written by Catholicks, if carping only and scolding be answering.
                  58. Wherfore to this instance here resumed by T. M. though I must remit him, or rather the Reader, for larger satisfactiō to the said Catholick Treatise, intituled The VVarnwoord;
                        Warnword, Encounter 2. c. 13. n. 18.19.20. &c. yet here briefly I am to tell him first, that he erreth grossely in affirming in this place, the Author of this Canon cited by him, Si Papa, to haue byn a Pope: for that the said Canon was gathered by Gratian out of the sayings of S. Boniface Martyr, as in the title of the sayd Canon is expressed: which Boniface,
                     The errour about S. Boniface the English Martyr. was neuer Pope, but a vertuous learned English-man, that liued aboue 850. yeares agone, and was the first Archbishop of Mentz or Moguntia in Germany: of which people, & Countrey he is called by all ancient writers the Apostle, for that he first publikely conuerted that Natiō, erected that primate Sea, and suffred glorious Martyrdome by the Gentills for the faith of Christ.

Wherfore the scoffe of T.M. calling him our Pope placed in the Calends of our Martyrs, besides the ignorāce tasteth also of much profane malice and impiety.
                  59. Secondly, I say, that these words of his are corruptly set downe, as ouer commonly els where, and that both in latin and English. In latin, for that he leaueth out the beginning of the Canon, which sheweth the drift therof, whose title is: Damnatur Apostolicus qui suae & 
                           •
                        raternae salutis est negligens. The Pope is damned, which is negligent in the affaire of his owne saluation and o
                           •
                         his brethren: and then beginneth the Canon, Si Papa suae & fraternae salutis negligens &c. shewing that albeit the Pope haue no Superiour-iudge in this world which may by authority check him, vnles he fall into heresie: yet shall his damnation be greater then of other synners, for that by reason of his high dignity, he draweth more after him to perdition then any other. Wherby we may perceiue that this Canon was not writtē to flatter the Pope, as Protestants would haue it seeme, but to warne him rather of his perill, togeather with his high authority.
                  60. After this the better to couer this pious meaning of S. Boniface, T.M. alleaging two lines of the same in Latin he cutteth of presently a third line that immediatly ensueth, to wit, Cum ipso plagis multis in aeternum vapulaturus: that such a Pope is to suffer eternall punishmēts, and to be scourged with many stripes togeather with the Diuell himselfe, if by his euill or negligent life, he be the cause of others perdition: which threat this man hauing cut of he ioyneth presently againe with the antecedent words, these as following immediatly in the Canon: Huius culpas redarguere praesumet nemo mortalium: This mans faultes (to wit the Pope) no mortall man shall or may presume to reprehend, and there endeth. In which

short phrase are many 
                        •
                     raudes. For first he leaueth out (i

                     ) here in this life: and then for (praesumit) in the present tense, that no man doth presume to checke him in respect of the greatnes of his dignity, this man saith (praesumet) in the future tense, that is, no man shall presume, or as himselfe translateth it, may presume to cotroll him, which is a malicious falshood. And lastly he leaueth out all that immediatly followeth conteining a reason of all that is sayd: Quia cunctos ipse iudicaturus, à nemine est iudicandus, nisi depre
                           •
                        endatur à fide deuius &c. for that whereas he is Iudge of all other men, he cannot himsel

                        e be iudged by any, except he be found to swarue from the true faith. Here then is nothing but fraudulent cyting & abusing of Authors.
                  61. But now thirdly remayneth the greatest corruption and abuse of all in his English translation, which is, that which most importeth his simple Reader that looketh not into the Latin, and this is that he translateth the former sentence of the Canon thus as before you haue heard: Though he should carry many peo
                           •
                        le with him to hell: yet no mortall creature may presume to say why do you so?
                     Great impudency But in the Latyn neither here, nor in the Canon it selfe, is there any such interrogation at all, as why do you so? And therefore I may aske T. M. why do you lye so? Or why do you delude your Reader so? Or why do yow corrupt your Author so? Or why do yow translate in English for the abu
                        •
                     ing of your Reader, that which neither your selfe do set downe in your Latin text, nor the Canon yt selfe by yow cited hath yt at all? Is not this wilfull and malicious fraud? Wherin when you shall answere me directly and sincerely, it shalbe a great discharge of your credit with those, who in the meane space will iustly hold you for a Deceiuer.
               
               62. Thus I pleaded with M. Morton at that tyme,

and was earnest inough as you see, if not ouer earnest, but all will not get an answere. Now we shall expect, that in his promised Reioinder he will answer all togeather, and that he may the better remember to do it, I thought conuenient to giue him this new record for remembring the sam

                     Mitig. pag. 203. Pag. 26.63. The eight Father (sayth M. Morton) is Pope Leo, writing to a true Catholike Emperour, saying:

                     You may not be ignorant that 
                           •
                        our Princely power is giuen vnto you, not only in worldly regiment, but also spirituall, for the preseruation of the Church. As if he said not only in Causes tēporall, but also in spirituall, so far as i
                           •
                         belongeth to the outward preseruation, not to the personall administration of them: and this is the substance of our English Oath. And further neither do our Kings of England challeng, nor Subiects condescend vnto. In which words you see two things are conteined: first what authority S. Leo the Pope aboue eleuen hundred yeares agone ascribed vnto Leo the Emperour in matters spirituall and Ecclesiasticall.
                        •
                      The second, by this mans assertion, that neither our Kings of England challeng, nor do the Subiects

condescend vnto any more in the Oath of the Supremacy, that is proposed vnto them: which if it be so, I see no cause why all English Catholickes may not take the same in like manner, so farre forth as S. Leo alloweth spirituall authority to the Emperour of his tyme. Wherfore i
                        •
                      behoueth that the Reader stand attent to the deciding of this question: for if this be true, which here M. Morton auoucheth, our controuersie about the Suprema

                        y is at an end.
               
               64. First then about the former point, let vs cōsider how many wayes T. M. hath corrupted the foresaid authority of S. Leo, partly by fraudulent allegation in Latin, and partly by false translation into English.Many falshoods.
                  For that in Latin it goeth thus, as himselfe putteth it downe in the margent: Debes incunctanter aduertere, Regiam potestatem non solùm ad mundi regimen,

                        aires, but especially for defence of the Church: and then do ensue immediatly these other words also in S. Leo, suppressed fraudulently by the Mynister, for that they explicate the meaning of the Author: Vt ausus nefarios comprimendo, & quae bene sunt statuta defendas, & veram pacem hijs quae sunt turbata, restituas. To the end that yow may by repressing audacious attēpts

                  65. This is the true meaning of S. Leo his speach

to the good and religious Emperour of the same name, as appeareth throughout the whole Epistle here cited and diuers others.

                  66. This thē was the cause & occasiō, wherin the holy Pope Leo did implore the help & secular arme of Leo the Emperour, for chastising those turbulent hereticks: to which effect he saith, that his Kingly power was not only giuen him for the gouerment of the world,Notable corruptiō of S. Leo his meaning. but also for the defence of the Church, which our Mynister doth absurdly translate, not only in worldly regiment, but also spirituall for the preseruation of the Church: turning ad into in, and praesidium into preseruation, and then maketh the Commentary which before we haue set downe: As if he had said (quoth he) not only in causes temporall, but also in spirituall, so far as it belongeth to outward preseruation, not to the personall administration of them.
                  
               
               67. Thus far I wrote hereof before, and proceded also further, shewing not only that he had corrupted both the text, sense and meaning of S. Leo, but also that fondly he had affirmed, that the Oath

of Supremacie exacted by King Henry and some of his followers in England, was, nor is any thing els but the acknowledging of so much authority spirituall as S. Leo granted to the Emperour of his dayes. Wherupon I do ioyne is

               LET vs come backe from Pope Leo vnto another  priuate Doctor named Genesius Sepulueda,
                  Sepulueda abused about Equiuocation. whom M. Morton in words calleth ours, but yet would make him his, if he could, in the question of Equiuocation: and for that he will not come of himselfe so farre as he would haue him, he giueth him a"

wrinch or two to force him to draw neerer, wherof my former accusation was this that ensueth.

Morton concludeth the whole matter by the testimony of our Doctor Genesius, as he calleth him, I haue told before how he is ours, and how in some sort he may in this controuersie be called his, though he detested his Religion, as by his works appeareth. Ours he is, as in all other points of Religion, so in the subs

But what saith this Doctor Genesius?

                     He will tell yow (sayth M. Morton) that this sense (of this text of Scripture) which yow conceale, is not only contrary to the sentence o
                           •
                         all Fathers, but also against all common sense. And is this possible? Will Sepulueda deny all those Fathers, alleadged by me before for our interpretatiō, to be Fathers? Will he say, that their exposition is cōtrary to all common sense? doth not Genesius himselfe in the very Chapter here cited alleage both S. Hierome and S. Augustine for this interpretation, and alloweth the same? What shameles dealing then is this of our Mynister to charge Genesius with such folly or impiety which he neuer thought of? For Genesius denieth not either the sense or interpretation of the place, and much lesse sayth, that it is cōtrary to the sentence of the Fathers, and least of all to cōmon sense: but denieth only the application therof for vse and practise to certaine Cases, wherin he admitteth not Equiuocation, and saith, that vpon this interpretation to bring in such a new law were greatly inconuenient (wherin afterwards notwithstanding we shall shew him to haue byn greatly deceiued:) & his Latin words are: Contrà non modò veterum

& grauissimorum Doctorum, sed communem hominum sensum quasi legem inducere: to bring in as it were a law, not only against the iudgment of ancient & most graue schole Doctors (for of thē only he speaketh in that place) but also against the common sense or opinion of men.
               
               
                  70. This is Genesius his speach, wherin though his iudgment be reiected by other Scholmen as singular and paradoxicall in this point, as after shalbe declared: yet is he egregiously abused by M. Morton,
                     Genesius much abused by M. Morton. who first maketh him to say of the interpretatiō & sense of this place of scripture, that which he speaketh only of the applicatiō therof, to vse & practice in tribunalls. And secondly he maketh him to discredit the Fathers which himselfe alleageth: then he englisheth ancient Fathers for anciēt Schoole doctors: & last of all addeth consensum of his own, leauing out hominum, to make it sound common sense: and other such abuses, which any man may see by conferring the place. And these are other manner of synnes then symple Equiuocation, yf the art of falsifying or forgery be any synne with him at all.
And so much for this place of Scripture. Thus wrote I in my said Treatise, being earnest, as you see, to draw some answere from M. Morton: but it would not come. It must be our patience to expect the same at his more commodity hereafter.

This therefore in Religion is the only way of concord, that all men with a pious and simple mynd, do wholy and purely conceiue, liue, speake and preach, as the holy Catholicke Roman Church, which God by his prouidence hath giuen for a teacher of truth vnto the whole world, doth teach, speake and preach.
               
               
                  
                  78. And now consider yow this dealing, that whereas Bish. Cunerus sayth: Haec est in religione concordiae sola ratio; this is the only way or meanes of concord in Religion; this man alleageth it in his margent, Haec est Religionis sola ratio: this is the only way of religion, as though concord and Religion were all one: & then by another tricke of crafty translation in his English text, that is only true religion; as though true religion and the way or meanes to come to true Religion were not different. And then for all the rest how it is mangled, and how many words and sentēces are put in by this Minister, which are none of Cunerus: and how many of his altered and put out, is easy for the Reader to see by comparing the two Latin texts before alleaged, and thereby to consider how facile a matter it is for this fellow to deuide tongues: A course (sayth he) which I professe in all disputes, when he deuideth and separateth the words from their Authors, and the sense from the words, and the whole drift from them both: a very fine course and fit for a man of his profession.
So much wrote I at that tyme: which had as you see some acrimony to draw out some satifaction frō 
                  M. Morton, if he had byn as full therof, as the title of his former booke of Full satisfaction pretendeth.

Morton in citing this authority: yt is strange, that in so small a matter, he would shew so great want of truth, or true meaning as heere he doth.

                  83. The third errour is of George Cassander in his booke Of the office of a pious man, where he teacheth that Princes ought to seeke out some meanes of peace betwixt Catholicks, Lutherās, Caluinists & other Sectes of our tyme: but in the meane space whiles they fynd no such meanes, the ought to permit euery one to follow his owne particuler faith, so as all do receaue the Scripture and common Creed of the Apostles: for so all are true members of the Church, albeit they disagree among thē
                     selues in particuler doctrines. These are Bellarmines wordes. Now let vs see how they are mangled by M. Morton both in Latin & English, as by him that hath the notablest talent therin (notwithstanding his solemne protestations to the contrary) that euer I read in my life.
               
               84. He putteth downe first the latin wordes in his margent thus:
                     Full Satisfact. pag. 55. 
                  Debent Principes inuenire rationem pacis inter Catholicos, Lutheranos, Caluinistas &c. qui omnes, dum Symbolum tenent Apostolicum, vera sunt membra Ecclesiae, licèt à nobis in particularibus dissentiant.
                  Which wordes M. Morton doth very d
                        •
                     ceiptfully English thus: Emperours should endeuour a reconciliation betwixt Papists and Protestants, because Protestāts hold the articles of the Creed, and are true mēbers of the Church, although they dissent from vs in some particuler opinions.So he.
               
                  85. And here now you see, first to be omitted cunningly and wilfully by this crafty Minister the wordes of much moment, before mentioned;Cassanders iudgment not allowed by English Protestāt
                           •
                        
                      to wit, That whiles Princes do not find a fit meane of peace, they ought to permit all to liue according to their particuler saith: which sentence of his graue and learned Cassander not seeming to himselfe allowable in our English State, or to his owne brethrē the English Caluinists, that now hauing gotten the gouernment, will suffer no

other Religion but their owne, he thought best to suppresse and cut them quite out. Secondly insteed of the conditionall speach vsed by Cassander, modò omnes ac
                           •
                        ipiant Scripturam &c. so that all do receiue the Scripture and Apostolicall Creed, he putteth it downe in English with a causitiue clause, as if it were, quia omnes Symbolum tenent &c. All Which Sects, because they do hold the Articles of the Creed, are true members of the Church, leauing out the word Scripture, and the English of (dum) that is, whiles they receaue the Scripture, and thereby doth, as yow see, peruert the other wholy in sense. For who will not hold it absurd, that Catholicks, Lutherans, Caluinists & other Sectes of our tyme, though in words they do admit both Scripture and Apostolicall Creed: yet differing in sense, and so many doctrines as they do, are all to be held notwithstanding for true members of one and the self same Church? Can any thing be more ridiculous then this?
               
               
                  86. Thirdly he doth most notably cogge in thrusting in the words (à nobis) from vs, which are not in the originall, meaning therby to make Cassander seeme a Catholicke, and to speake in the behalf of Catholicks, which is plaine cosenage: and to this end also he leaueth out dogmatibus. And fynally you see, that he shapeth euery thing to his owne purpose & by making C

                     leight of his English trā
                     slation.87. And thus much for the corruption of the latin text. But his English hath other corruptions also, according to his ordinary custome.
For first he translateth Debent Principes, that Emperours should endeauour a reconciliation, to confirme therby his

former vanity, that Cassander was so great a man with Emperours, as he talketh not but to Emperors, wheras the word Principes vsed by Cassander doth cō
                     prehend all sortes of Princes. Secondly he translateth Catholicos, Lutheranos, Caluinistas
                           •
                         &c. which words of (& caetera) comprehend all other Sects of our time as Anabaptists, Arrians, Trinitarians, H
                           •
                        ssites, Picardians and the like: he translateth them, I say, Papists, and Protestants, as though all those Sects of our tyme were to be comprehended vnder the name of Protestants of the English faith: or as though Cassander, yf he were a Catholike, as here he is pretended, would call vs Papists.
               
               
                  88. Thirdly wheras in his owne Latin here set downe, he saith: Qui omnes dum Symbolum tenent &c. All which, to wit, Catholiks, Lutherans, Caluinists & other Sectaries, whiles they hold the Apostolicall Creed, are true members of the Church: he doth English it thus, because Protestants hold the Articles of the Creed, and are true members of the Church,
                     Bellarmins opinion falsified. excluding Catholicks from belieuing the said Articles, or being true members: which in his owne Latin (and that of Bellarmines) also are included. And fourthly is the corruption before mentioned (although they dissent from vs in some particuler opinions) which in Bellarmine is although they dissent among themselues in particuler doctrines. And finally the wordes by him cited of Bellarmines iudgment, which he controlleth, to wit, falsa est haec sententia Cassandri: non possunt enim Catholici reconciliari cum haereticis, are not so in Bellarmine: but these, potest facilè reselli haec Cassandri sententia: primum enim non possunt Catholici, Lutherani & Caluinistae eo modo conciliari &c. This sentence of (Cassander) may easily be refelled: first, for that Catholicks, Lutherans, and Caluinists (for example) cannot so be reconciled as Cassander appointeth, to wit, by admitting only the

wordes of the Creed, for that we differ in the sense and somtimes in the Articles themselues, as in that, descendit ad inferos, he descended into Hell: & in like manner we agree not about the sense of those other Articles, I belieue the Catholicke Church, and Communion of Saints, Remission of sinnes &c. So Bellarmine: all which this fellow omitteth.
               
               
                  89. And so you see there is no truth or sinceritie with him in any thing. Neither can these escapes b
                        •
                      ascribed any way to ouersight, errour, mystaking or forgetfulnes: but must needs be attributed to wilfull fraud & malicious meaning, purposely to deceaue, as the things themselues do euidently declare. For which cause I shall leaue him to be censured by his owne brethrē, but specially by his Lord & Maister, for so notable discrediting their Cause, by so manifest false manner of proceeding.
               
               90. These were my words in the other Treatise whereupon I insisted the more in regard of the multiplicitie of fraudes discouered. And so M. Morton had not any iust pretence to say (as he insinuateth) that this with the rest of the Charges layd against him, and pretermitted by him, were either of lesse importance, or lesse insisted vpon then those other fourteene which he chose out to answere.
            
            
               THE EIGHTEENTH Falshood pretermitted by Thomas Morton. §. XVIII.
               
                  
                  Royardus and Cunerus peruerted against their words & meaning about obedience to temporall Princes.AS the former example apperteyned vnto the abuse of two together: so doth this that next weare to alleage which are indeed two distinct things: but that drawing to an end I am forced to ioine diuers togeather. Wherfore I accused him in

my former writing to haue corrupted two Authors ioyntly, Royard a Friar, and Cunerus a Bishop: which accusation I set downe in these words.
               
                  92. And heere will I passe ouer (said I) many things that might be noted out of the sequent pages namely 30.31.34. where he doth so peruert and abuse both the wordes, discourse, and sense of diuers Authours alledged by him, as is not credible to him that doth not compare thē with the bookes themselues from whence they are taken.
                        Mitig. p. 232. Pag. 30.3
                           •
                        .34. As for example, Royardus the Franciscan Friar is brought in with commendation of an honest Friar, for that he saith; That a King when he is made by the people, cannot be deposed by thē againe at their pleasure: which is the same doctrine, that all other Friars & learned Catholiks do hold, so long as he conteyneth himselfe within the nature of a King: for that otherwise (which is the question in controuersie) Royard himselfe saith parendum ei non esse, that he is not to be obeyed:
                     
                        Royard. Serm. 1. in Domin. 1. Aduent.
                      but this is not to be iudged by the people and their mutiny, as Protestant Doctors do teach.
               
               
                  93. And to like effect he citeth a discourse,
                        Serm. 2. in Domin. 23. post Pentecost
                      though most brokenly out of B. Cunerus writing against the Rebels of Flanders, and testifying, that it lyeth not in the peoples handes to reiect their Prince at their pleasure, as those Protestant subiects did: and then M. Morton as though he had atchiued some great victory triumpheth exceedingly, saying: That for so much as Friars in our Councells haue no voice, but only Bishops, he hath brought forth a Bishop against vs; whom for that the moderate Answerer had named a little before, this man scornfully telleth him Caesarem appellasti, ad Caesaremibis. You haue appealed to Cunerus,
                     Royardus and Cunerus abused. and now he shall be your Iudge against you. And is not this great folly & insolency? for that Cunerus in all that his booke saith nothing against vs,

               THE NINTEENTH Falshood pretermitted by Thomas Morton. §. XIX.
               
               
                  Sayer grossely abused about Haereticus pertinax.
                  FROM strangers we returne to a Countrey-man of our owne, no lesse abused by M. Morton, then any commonly of the former, which I set downe in these wordes.
               95. But the greatest corruption in this page said I (& it is notable indeed) is of the words, sense & meaning of our learned Countrey-man Sayer,
                  
                     Mitig. pag. 227. of whom T. M. writeth thus. In beiefe our Countrey-man vpon this Case of conscience saith:

                  An obstinate hereticke is as well he that is presumed so to be, as he that is manifest. And againe in the same page:

                     Seeing therfore that

                        ke, is taken for an obstinate, who can be free from your censures? And then citeth in the margent these wordes of Sayer: Contumax haereticus est tam praesumptus quàm mani
                           •
                        estus. An obstinate hereticke is as well

                        e that is presumed to be so, as he that is manifest, or knowne for such: which may seeme to be a great iniustice in our doctrine. But if I do not shew this deuise to be one of the most manifest and faithles deceiptes and corruptions that euer any honest man put in paper against his Aduersary, thē let me be censured for too sharp a reprehēder.
               
               
                  96. For first
                        •
                      
                     Sayer hath no such matter at all concerning obstinacy in heresy,A notable falsificatiō of Sayer. his whole purpose being only to declare who may be excōmunicated by a Iudge for contumacie in not appearing (which is a different thing from obstinacy or pertinacie) & this whether he be hereticke or Catholike: nay he speaketh either only or principally of Catholicks, who do shew contumacie in any Court or Tribunall, in not appearing, and answering, according as they are cited and summoned by a lawfull Iudge: and so he defineth Contumacie in these words:The definition of contumacy. 
                     Contumacia (saith he) nihil aliud est quàm inobedientia quaedam qua ius dicenti non paretur. Contumacie is nothing els, but a certaine disobedience, wherby he is not obeyed that 
                        •
                     itteth in iudgment. So as here is no mentiō or meaning of obstinacie in heresie. And further he puteth downe two sorts of contumacie thus: Cō
                        tumax duobus modis esse potest, nimirum mani
                           •
                        estus & praesū
                        ptus: A man may be contumacious in two sorts or manners, either manifest or by presumption: and he giueth diuers exāples of both
                        •
                      as namely: Yf a man cited do refuse openly to appeare or obey his Iudge, this mans cō
                     tumacie or disobedience is publicke and manifest, and therby he is made contumax manifestus: but if he

do not refuse openly, but by idle dilations & shifte
                        •
                      doth put of, or delude the Court, he is contumax praesumptus, that is, presumed to be contumacious, and so may excōmunicatiō (if it be a spirituall Court) proceed against him, as if his contumacie were manifest.
               
               
                  97. Now then what hath all this to do with Contumax haereticus tā praesumptus quàm mani
                           •
                        estus? Hath Sayer any such word or sentence?The difference betwene cō
                        tumacy & pertinacy. No truely: or shall we thinke Tho. Morton to be so simple both in Grā
                     mar, Law, & Deuinitie, as that he doth not know what difference there is betweene contumax and pertinax? wherof the one is a fault in obedience towards our Superiours, as now hath byn shewed, the other of tenacity of opinion, as before we haue declared? Of if Tho. Morton will not confesse this ignorance, but that he knoweth the difference of the wordes & of their significations, sense & applications here vsed by the Authors then must he cō
                     fesse wilfull deceipt in vsing one for the other,Many false sleights. and much more in twice translating the words Co

                           •
                        estus doth signify in Sayer one that vpon presumption only is iudged to be as obstinate an hereticke, as if he were manifest: wherof Sayer neither spake nor meant, but in a quite different sense (not appertayning to heresy at all) saith: That a man may be condemned as contumacious by presumption, if he appeare not before his lawfull iudge, or vseth sleights, diuerticles or delayes, aswell as if openly he refused to appeare. Now then consider what a Mynister of truth this is, and of what naked innocencie, thus perfidiously to delude his Reader: and yet to

come forth after all with this dissembled Hypocrisy, Now let me be beholding vnto you (saith he) for an answere. And so I thinke he is, but if not sharpe inough for so shamefull an abuse, it may be amended and augmented hereafter vpon like occasions,
                        Pag. 4. which euery where are offered throughout his whole booke.
And there were no end if I would answere him to all. Hitherto was my former reprehension to M. Morton for his shamefull dealing, which seemed to me to import either great ignorance, or intolerable lacke of conscience in going about to deceiue his Reader. Some word of answere had bene worth the writing in so great a Charge: but he thought it not expedient.
            
            
               THE TWENTITH Falshood pretermitted by Thomas Morton. §. XX.
               
               FROM Christians and Coūtrey-men he passeth to Heathens & committeth such notorious falshoods against one of them, euen then and there,Cicero falsyfied in the question of swearing to a theefe &c. where he speaketh of faithfull dealing against perfidiousnes, as may iustly make any man admyre, what he did suppose his iudicious Reader would thinke of him, when he should see the fraud disclosed, of which fraud I wrote thus in my former Treatise, beginning first with the relation of his owne words in this manner.
               
                  99. There was a man (saith M. Morton) who togeather with nyne other prisoners being dismissed out of the prison of Carthage vpon his Oath,
                        Mitig. p. 462. that he within a prefixed time should returne againe:

home to Rome, where he stayed beyond the time appointed, answering that he was freed frō his Oath:
But see now the opinion of his owne Countreymā

                     niball. concerning this Equiuocatiō of returne. This was not well done (sayth Tully) for that craft in an oath doth not lessē but make the periury more heynous. Wherfore the graue Senators of Rome sent this cosening mate backe againe to the prison of Hanniball their enimy, from whom he had escaped &c.
               
                  
                     L. 3. Offi. §. Regulꝰ.100. Thus relateth M. Morton the Case, and then maketh this malicious Conclusion against vs:

                        idiousnesse it selfe. And would not you thinke that M. Mort. did hold himselfe very free from this perfidiousnes, who obiecteth the same so freely against vs? And not only against vs, but to the whole Church of Rome it selfe, and to the vniuersall Catholicke Religiō conioyned therwith? Marke then the deportment of this man in this one point, and if you knew him not befo

                  101. First then I would haue some Grammer scholler that studieth Tullies Offices, to turne to the places here quoted,
                        Cic. 3. Offic. §. Regulꝰ & §. Sed si. and comparing them with that which this Minister setteth downe in english, consider how they hang togeather, & how he picketh out one sentence in one place, & another in another, and leapeth forth & backe to make some coherence of speach contrarie to the Authors order, sense & method, as is ridiculous to behould, and fit for the cosening mate, of whom he talketh in his text. And secondly after this, is to be noted, tha
                        •
                      he setteth downe the narration it selfe of ten men deliuered vpon their Oath by Hanniball, not as Cicero

doth out of two historiographers Polybius & Accilius, and in particuler against the faith of both their histories, and Tullies asseueration, which saith that those ten were dismissed by Hāniball out of his Camp post Cānensem pugnā
                      after the famous battaile of Cāna in Apulia, Mort. ignorātly saith, they were dismissed out o
                           •
                         the prison of Carthage, wheras they of all liklyhood had neuer seene Carthage in their liues.
               
               
                  102. But the most notorious cosenage is, that he peruerteth all Cicero his meaning, words, sense, and discourse in this matter, alleaging them quite contrary to himself, as before you haue heard him do many other Authors, so as he belieth and corrupteth them all, both profane and diuine. And if in this one point, he can deliuer himself from Punica fides, I will say he playeth the man indeed.T.M. pressed with Punica fides about falsification. For first Cicero whome here he would seme to bring against vs, doth fully agree with vs, for that we say in the Case of those ten Romans deliuered by Hanniball vpon their oath to returne againe, if they should not obtayne that with they were sent for (which was to perswade the Senate to redeeme diuers thousands of other Roman souldiers, whome Hanniball had taken in the said victory at Canna:) we hold, I say, first, that if they sware absolutly to returne againe, if they obteined not their suite, they were bound truly and sincerely to performe the same. And secondly, that they being now iustly by law of armes prisoners of Hanniball, they were bound to sweare sincerely to his intention, and not to any other reserued meaning of their owne, as in the former Chapter hath byn declared. And this very same doctrine also teacheth Cicero by light of nature, in these words, perfidiously

If you should not pay the price or ransome vnto publick theeues, which was agreed betweene you for sauing of your life, it is no deceipt, no, though you had sworne to performe it: for that it is not periury to sweare false (in any sort whatsoeuer.) But if you sweare a thing which you determine in your mynd and do vtter it in words, according to the common custome of

                        d of egregious cosenage. and do condemne it for periury: wheras Cicero affirmeth, that there is neither periury nor fraud therein. And the same Philosopher alloweth the very same example of swearing with a reserued intention to a publick theef, without either meaning or obligation to performe it, which M. Morton obiecteth to Azor in the precedent Chapter, though craftily leauing out the words Latroni and Tyranno, for auoiding the force of this place, as before is noted, saying: that Azor did condemne for lying all such Equiuocation against his subtile brethren: whereas he both affirmeth and proueth the same, no lesse then Cicero doth here in this place, as before hath byn shewed. Who then shall ryse in iudgement against T. Morton for all this wilfull lying? No doubt but Sathā himself, that is the Father of lyers in this life, & shalbe their tormentor in the next.
               
               105. Thus farre at that tyme I wrote against M. Morton. And truly when I read it ouer agayne, togeather with many other points before mentioned and do consider how weighty matter of accusatiō they do conteyne, and how much I do insist vpon them to make the deformity therof appeare in the Readers ey

Morton, if it were possible, and therby to draw from him either some sound answere, or a simple confession of his errours, so farre as such they may be called: or rather of his witting fraud to beguile his Reader, which were the best and truest forme of answere, if almighty God would giue him light to see the same (though I will presume that he synned not wholy against his conscience therein, but framed rather

                  ull perhaps to streyne truth for helping such a cause as his

is:) yet I can not but meruaile, that he would passe ouer with sylence all these grauer matters, and betake himself to sleighter things in this his last Answere, telling notwithstanding his Reader, that he chose out 14. principall points to answere, such as I insisted most vpon: which by experience hath bin euinced to be most false by these 20. which I haue alledged, as wittingly pretermitted by him, & might sundry more, wherof the most are more weighty, & much more insisted vpon then any of the former.
            
            
               THE ONE and twentith, and two and twentith falshoods pretermitted by M. Morton §. XXI.
               
                   ALBEIT my intention was to note only these precedent 20. heads of falshood wittingly pretermitted by M. Morton,
                  Of two abuses offered in citing D. Barkley. wherof each one, or most of them do conteyne sundry branches vnder them: yet that you may know that this number of 20. is not precise, but that many others may be added also, if a man will but runne ouer my said Treatise: I haue thought good to note 2. more here togeather concerning one and the self same man, to wit, Doctor Barkley a Scottishman. The first, in that he relateth a certaine cholerick speach of the said Doctor Barkley vsed against an argument of Doctor Boucher, as though it had bene spoken against Bellarmine, whom it concerned not
                     •
                   My words were these.
               
                  107. Here then you see (quoth I) how many wilfull corruptions there be, first to bring in D. Barkley rating of Cardinall Bellarmine which magna sanè impudentia est &c. whereas he talketh not against Bellarmine at all: nor indeed is Bellarmines manner of speach cō
                     trary

to that which Barkley will haue to be the meaning of the History:
                        Mitig. pag. 198. for that Barkley doth not so much stand vpon the thing in cōtrouersy for Priests authority,Enumeration of falsities. but vpon the manner of proofe by the examples alleaged by D. Boucher, of Ieroboam, Ozias, Athalia and some other Princes, in whose punishmēt God vsed Priests for means and instruments. Non ignoro (saith he) ius esse Ecclesiae in Reges & Principes Christianos, nec quale ius sit ignoro, sed id tam alien is argumentis ostendi, prorsus ignoro: imo non ostendi planè scio. I am not ignorant (saith Doctor Barkley) that the Church hath right ouer Christian Kings and Princes, nor am I ignorāt, what manner of right it is:
                        Ibid. c. 11. yet do I not see, how the same may be proued by such impertinent arguments; nay I know rather that it can not be so proued: which words going but very few lines before those that T. M. alleageth, he could not but see, and yet left them out, and then beginneth against vs his English text thus. Your owne Doctor calleth this your assertiō most false, & contrary to the direct History of the Bible, to wit, that Ozias was deposed of his Kingdome by Azarias the high Priest.
               
               108. And this is the first abuse, as to me it seemeth, inexcusable. The second is about an authority of S. Ambrose, craftily cut of from the speach of the said D. Barkley by M. Morton wherof my accusation in my former Treatise was this.
               
                  109. But yet if we would exāine (quoth I) the particuler authorityes that be alleaged about this matter,
                        Mitig. p. 202. though nothing making against vs, as hath byn said, and consider how many false shifts are vsed by T. M. therin, you would say he were a Doctor indeed in that science, for that a seuerall Treatise will scarse conteine thē. I will touch one for example sake. He citeth D. Barkley bringing in the authority of S. Ambrose that

                           •
                         Barkley doth alleadg in the very selfe same place, which is, Allegatur Imperatori licere omnia &c. It is alleadged,
                        Full satisfact. p. 24. Barkleus l. 3. c. 5. that it is lawfull for the Emperor to do all things, for that all things are his (and cōsequently that he may assigne a Church vnto the Arrians:) wherto I answere, saith S. Ambrose: Trouble not your selfe ô Emperour, nor think that you haue Imperiall right ouer those things that are diuine. Do not exalt your selfe, but if you will raigne long, be subiect to God: for it is written, that those things that belong to God, must be giuen to God: and to Cesar only those things that belong to Cesar.
                     
                        Ambr. l. 5. Ep. 33.
                  
Pallaces apperteyne to the Emperour, but Churches to the Priest. The right of defending publike walles is cō
                  mitted to you, but not of sacred things. Thus D. Barkley out of S. Ambrose in the very place cited by T. M. which he thought good wholy to pretermit and cut of,A cleare authority of S Ambrose, imbezeled by T. M. and yet to make a florish as though D. Barkley had cited S. Ambrose to prooue that the temporall Prince and Emperour was in noe case, nor in any cause spirituall or temporall, to be withstood or resisted. And what will yee say of this manner of dealing? Out of what conscience may it proceed? But let vs see another Charge that conteineth ten falshoods togeather, and so with that we will make an end.
            
            
               OF TEN OTHER Falshoodes set downe togeather and dissembled by Thomas Morton. §. XXIII.
               AS the former Charge had two examples togeather, so this last hath ten at a clap (to

make vp 32.) which I set downe in my former Treatise in these wordes.
               
               111. There followeth (said I) within 2. leaues after a heape not only of falshoods,Of diuers authors falsified about the depositiō of Popes. but also of impudencies. For wheras his Aduersary the moderate Answerer had said, That not only Kings but Popes also for heresie by the Canō lawes were to be deposed: he answereth thus:

The Authours of the doctrine of deposing Kinges in Case of heresy, do professe concerning Popes, That they cannot possibly be hereticks, as Popes, and consequently cannot be deposed: not saith Bellarmine by any power Ecclesiasticall or Temporall,

And is not this strange dealing? Let Canus that goeth in the myddest speake, for all fiue, who hauing proued first at large the opposit proposition to T. M. to wit, that Popes may fall into heresy and be deposed for the same, concludeth thus his discourse: Non est igitur negandum

                  By which last words of

                     Canus is discouered the ridiculous fallacy of T.M. alleaging here out of our fore

But yet that God (as Popes) will neuer permit them to decree any hereticall doctrine to be held by the Church.
               114. Consider then I pray you (said I) what a fellow this Minister is in abusing thus so many Authors so manifestly: but especially do you note the impudency of his Conclusion.

You haue heard them now protest the contrary, and you may read them in the places here cited, out of all the nyne seuerall writers before mentioned, who by their expresse contrary doctrine do proue T. M. to haue made nyne seuerall lyes against them in this his assertion, and now the tenth and most notorious of all,Ten lyes made at once. is this his Conclusion, That they do auouch

                     anifest falsity therof seene in their owne words and works here by me cited, it cōteineth also great folly & simplicity to say, that they auouch the consent of Romish Deuines and Canonists for an hundred yeares: for that their proofes are much elder: & Bellarmine among the rest for deposition of Popes, doth cite the 8. Generall Councell vnder Pope Adrian the second for aboue six hundred yeares agone: and the Canon Si Papa, out of our Countrey man S. Boniface Archbishop of Ments & Martyr aboue seauen hundred yeares agon,

and collected by Gratian and confirmed by Popes, as part of the Canon law, aboue foure hundred years agone. So as to say that now they auouch Authors o

                         an hundred yeares old, against that, which for so many hundred yeares before was held and established, is meere folly or rather foolish malice.
               
               115. Thus I wrote in my former Treatise of Mitigation, wherby, as by all the rest that here hath bin set downe, the Reader will see, what store of graue matter M. Mortō
                   had to answere for his owne defēce, if indeed he had meant to defend himself really and substantially, and not to haue slipt out vnder the shaddow of a Preamble for answering his aduersary: but indeed laying hands only vpon a few & the lightest imputations that he could picke out. And yet by the way the Reader must note, that euery one, or the most of these examples of falshood here obiected do cōteine diuers & sundry points, which being laid togeather do make (I dare auouch) a double number to that, which heere we haue sett downe, if they were seuered & singled out after the manner of M. Mortons mincing his imputations before produced about Goodman, Knox, Buchanan, Syr Thomas VViat, & the like, seuerally set forth to the shew. So as according to this reckoning we may boldly say, that he hath left out heere aboue threescore witting & voluntary vntruthes, which he knew could hardly, or neuer handsomly be answered. And besides these 
                     •
                  e hath purposely also left out the mention of other matters no lesse weighty then the former, though not in the same kind of falshood and lying, yet no lesse cūningly pretermitted, subtracted, or concealed to the aduantage of his cause, in this last Reply of his, thē any lightly of the former, which we are to lay forth in the Chapter that ensueth.

                THE PREFACE.
               
                  HITHERTO haue we beheld the omissions or rather pretermissiōs (to wit omissions volūtary) vsed by M. Morton in answering the chiefe accusations layd against him in matter of falsity, and vntrue dealing; now you are to see others of another kind, which though in my opinion they do proceed out of the same motiue (which was by delaying the answere, to auoid the necessity of answering at all) yet are they

in a different subiect or matter, not so much concerning corruptiōs & falsifications immediatly, as the other, but about sūdry principall partes of my Treatise (yea all in effect) no lesse craftily concealed then the rest, though with a certaine pretence and faint promise to answere them afterward. But for that I haue iust cause to suspect this promise, as a dilatory shi
                     •
                  t and subtile 
                     •
                  ua
                     •
                  ion, wherby to deteine from the Readers knowledg what I wrote in may said Treatise, making him to thinke by the perusall of this his Preamble of Reply that I had handled nothing therin worthy the relation or confutation, besides those trifles which himself pleased before to lay forth: for this cause (I say) I am forced heere to detaine my selfe a litle longer in repeating againe some chiefe points of my said Booke, which M. Morton hath passed ouer with silence leauing only a hope, as hath bene said, that in time he will satisfie them.
               
                  How prudent creditours doe proceed with doubtfull debtors.2. But in this case I meane to proceed as Creditors do with old & doubtfull debtors, which is, to examine the accōpts, & make vp the Reckoning, while the debts ar yet sōwhat fresh in memory. For better declaration wherof I will vse this example, or comparison. If a marchant in London, or els where hauing many charges of debts laid vpō him, should promise, that (at such a time, when accompts are wont to be clered, & made streight) he would answere al, & thē the prefixed time approaching he should suddainly withwraw himselfe, leauing some small & scattered sūmes (& those also of very bad coines) to satisfie for great & many obligations, promising further that in time he would yeeld aboūdant satisfactiō for all the rest.
               3. In this case I would demaūd, what the prudent Creditors would do, think, or suspect, especially finding the sūmes of money left to be so small, & of so

bad coine, as now hath byn said? Two things do occur vnto me, that they would do for their better assurance. First to informe thēselues well, what store of debts the said party was to be charged withall. Secondly quid habeat in bonis, what substāce he might be presumed to haue for satisfying therof. And this I take to be the very Case also betwene me & M. Mort. who being charged with very many debts and obligatiōs of answering matters obiected against him in my foresaid Treatise, he tooke a respite vntill the ordinary time of payment, which was the time of his Reply: which time comming, he gaue vs insteed of a booke a Preamble only (though a large one) answering not to the tenth part of that he was indebted: & this so weakely & fraudulētly, handling matters impertinent, as no way it can passe for currant coine, as now in part you haue seene, and shall do more in that which ensueth.
               4. Wherfore I am cōstrained to performe the parts of the forsaid Creditors, making first a suruey of the chiefe debts lyable against him, and which he is to answere, & then to examine what liklihood of paiment, or satisfaction he may be thought to haue, for effectuating the same: both which points you haue in part seene already put in execution by me in my former discourse. For you haue heard the many charges laid against him for falsity & vntrue dealing & you will h
                     •
                  rdly I thinke conceiue, where he will haue the substance to answere them. Now we are to make the search in another sort of debts, wherin I perswade me that the like in many points, though not altog
                     •
                  ather the same will fall out, to wit, that the debts will be found cleare, & the satisfactiō not easy: wherin I referre my selfe to that which is to ensue.

And after this I added further to this effect: I will passe ouer (quoth I) the testimony of many other learned protestant Ministers, Doctors, & teachers, as namely Conradus Sclusselburgius, who affirmeth Caluinists, To belieue and teach rightly no one article of the Creed: as also I will do that of Heshusiꝰ, affirming, That their associatiō is a most blasphemous & sacrilegious sect: that of Hunnius, That it is most damnable, & the right way to hell: that of Ioannes Schutzius, That it is the sinke of all wicked heresyes; that of Ioannes Modestus, that affirmeth Caluinists, To be as bad as Iewes & Mahomets: that of Ioannes Matthias, and of Albertus Grauerus, and others, that affirme all those that follow the doctrine of Caluin, to be professed enemyes of Christ.

                  euerations, the childish

clamour of M. Morton against Catholiks for holding his Caluiniā doctrine to be heresy, seing that so many learned & graue Protestants inlightened with the spirit of God (as they must needs graunt) do hold & auerre the same.
               8. And why then had not he answered somwhat to this Charge, being so weighty, & substantiall as it is? Why had he not giuen some satisfaction? Or at leastwise mētioned the same in this his last Reply? Was not this as necessary a subiect to be handled as to put himself to discusse the wit, memory, skill, and other qualities of his Aduersary? Or when do you thinke will he be able to answere this matter? Or what substance hath he, or may be presumed to haue for making this payment?
               9. Nay, that his substance is small, or rather none at all for discharging these debts, may well appeare, for that he being further pressed by me afterward about the like argument of Iohn Caluins being an hereticke, and that most heinous & damnable by the publike testimony of his said Protestant brethren the Lutheran Doctors, and this not only in the common known controuersies betweene thē, about the Reall presence, & other Sacraments, for which by Luther they were called Sacramentaries: but euen about the highest articles of the blessed Trinity, Diuinity of Christ, & equality with his Father, Godhead of the Holyghost & the like; he hath shifted of the same in this his Reply by no lesse silence, then the former: not so much as naming the matter, but in generall termes telling vs that he will pay all his debts in time: & yet did I vrge him as much as might be, to draw frō him some answere. For thus I said vnto him, when he had accused al our writers of extreme malignity in cēsuring Caluin & Caluinists for heretiks, insinuati

(a poore shift you see, when their owne bookes are extant in print, & the places knowne of their printing) I told him, I say, that I would bring against him a new booke of a famous late Lutheran Doctor, & Reader of Deuinity called Aegidius Hunnius printed at VVittemberg vpon the yeare 1593. which should confirme this and much more. My words were these.

                  This is the title & argument of the booke, which he doth prosecute for almost two hundred pages togeather, diuiding the same into two partes: the first wherin he sheweth, how Iohn Caluin most wickedly, & maliciously vnder pretence of interpreting the Scripture in differēt sense from the ancient Fathers, did go about couertly to weaken, infringe, or take from the Christi
                        •

                     st arguments which they had, or haue out of the Scriptures for the Godhead of Christ, and his equality, and consubstantiality with the Father &c. And in the second part of his

booke Doctor Hunnius sheweth that the said Caluin vseth the same fraud, and malice by ouerthrowing all the predictions, & fortellings of Prophets about Christ, is he was man.
               
               11. Thus far I wrote at that time, and then produced somewhat largely and particulerly 18. examples partly out of the old,Iohn Caluin an angel of darknesse with the Lutherās. and partly out of the new Testament, maliciously peruerted by him in fauour of Iewes and Arrians, against the truth and certainty of Christian Religion, leauing out 20. more, which Doctor Hunnius doth handle, and in the end concludeth thus: Quapropter vt receptui canam, detectū satis super

                      iudico, Angelum illum tenebrarum Ioannem Caluinum, qui ex abyssi puteo emergens &c. VVherfore that I may now (saith he) retire my selfe, I do iudge that Angell of darknes Iohn Caluin to be sufficiently, and more then sufficiently discouered, who being raysed from the pit of hell to the peruerting of mankind, hath partly by his detestable desire of wresting Scriptures & ouerthrowing the bulwarkes of Christiā Religion, which it hath against Iewes and Arians: partly also by his impious pen against the holy and sacred Maiestie of Iesus Nazarenus, now exalted in heauen; partly also by his peruerse doctrine of the Sacraments, and horrible monstrous paradoxes of his absolute predestination, hath obscured in these our later dayes no small part of the light and sunne of Gods truth, and drawne with him a great number of starres, as the Apocalyps saith, headlong into hell: from whom God euerlasting by his mercy signe & protect his seruants, least they may be in

               12. Hitherto are the wordes of Doctour Egidius Hunnius which you see with what vehemency of spirit and protestation he vttereth them against the heresies of Caluin and Caluinists,
                  A cōsideration of much weight. so as they may easely be

seene to come from his hart, & full determination of his setled iudgemēt, who being so principall a Protestant, and learned Doctour, and Professour of Deuinity, & held for a brother of the selfe same Church by which M. Morton meaneth to be saued (if he haue any such meaning) I meruaile what impression it maketh in him, or whether it maketh any thing at all, which I should haue beene glad to haue vnderstood by a word or two of his answere: but nothing commeth from him; and so this debt must be laid vp with the rest, vntill the day of payment come, which when it may be, or how much, or what he will be able to pay,How Caluinisme is heresy by the iudgment of learned Protestāts. yea (though he de

But yet one thing is cleare without any answere of his, & I would haue it noted by the reader, that all his inuectiues to his Maiesty against vs, for calling and holding them as heretiks out of the fo

                  Two other heads of controuersy.13. Two other great heads of cōtrouersy there were betweene vs in this first part of my forsaid Treatise about Rebellion: the first, whether the doctrine of Catholicks, or of Protestants did more fauour obedience vnto their temporall princes, & secondly which part did most practize the same. And about the first for Catholicke doctrine, it is largely proued by me throughout the whole first part of my Treatise, that it is exact

in all respects for obliging men to do all due obediēce both vnto temporall & spirituall superiours,Catholick doctrine touching Obediēce to Princes not only when they are good and vertuous, but also dis

                     lis, that is, bad & fastidious, as the Apostles word is; & that we must obey thē out of conscience, as Ministers of God, frō whom they haue their authority, & power. And when the exorbitāt defects of any Prince, or gouernor shall impose necessity of redresse or restraint, it may not be by priuate Authority, or popular mutiny: but by order, iudgmēt, & publike authority. Wheras on the other side the Protestāt doctrine is shewed out of their owne words, writers, & authors, to teach the quite cōtrary, which authors I do cite, as namely Caluin, Beza, Hottomā, & others in France, by the testimonyes of Launay, Belforest, & other French writers,

               OF M. MORTONS Pretermissions in the second argument of my Treatise, about Equiuocation. §. II.
               YOV haue heard how many principall points M. Morton hath passed ouer with a deepe silence (as it were) in the first argument of my Treatise, concerning the controuersy of Rebellion: Now let vs turne our eyes vpon the second subiect, which is of Equiuocation, against which he made such great clamours and outcries in his former empty booke of full Satisfaction, as if it had beene the most strange, new, absurd ridiculous, and blasphemous doctrine in the world. For clearing of which point I was forced to write fiue or six large Chapters, and bestow almost three hundred pages to represse his sayd clamours, vaine exasperations, and childish insultations against the same, reducing first the whole matter to fiue serious, and important considerations as it were, for an entrance into the whole Treatise. The first, how peruersely, and calumniously M. Morton and his fellowes do deale with vs to make vs odious in this controuersy, mistaking of purpose the true state of the question of which point I wrote then as followeth.
               20. And first of all (said I) to the end the indifferent Reader may vnderstād with what kind of aduersaries we are to deale in this matter,
                  
                     Mitig. p. 274.275. 
                  I thinke it necessary for declaring their peruersity and preuenting some calumniations, to make a certaine briefe protestation or explication here, at the beginning,
                  About the peruersity of our aduersaries.

                     Gratian. Causa 22. c. 2. 
                  but yet for that the infirmity of man is such (saith S. Augustine) as one will hardly belieue another without an oath, the Church of God hath allwaies so interpreted those words of Christ, so as they take not all liberty of swering from Christians in necessary cases, albeit perfect men would passe with the same. And this is S. Augustines reason in sundry partes of his workes, and is translated into the Canon law by Gratiā, and consequently also allowed by Popes, and the sea Apostolicke &c.
               
               22. Thus I wrote at that time alleadging many other authorityes & examples of Scripture, for proofe of the same, shewing that many things are cōmended for perfection, but yet are not cōmanded by ordinary obligation: as,Diuers things are commendable, and of perfection, but not of ob

               23. All these things I say, were good & higly to be cō
                  mēded, but yet the cōtrary therof is not to be cōdēned for sinne, but permissible: & the li

                  e in Equiuocation. Vnto which consideration I adioyned 4. others. First that the allowāce, & vse of this Amphibologie, or Equiuocation was knowne, & practized in Catholick Christiā Schooles ouer the world for aboue 400. yeares past,Fiue consideratiōs about the vse of Equiuocation. by M. Mortons owne confession. The second, that the men that both taught, and vsed the same, were holy, learned, & graue, and great louers otherwise of truth, & consequently would neuer haue approued, or exercised the same, if it had byn so great an iniquity, & offensiue to God, as M. Mort. & his fellowes do pretēd.
               24. The third consideration, or rather fourth in order is, that there be many cases, which do fall out in mans life, (as afterward more at large, & in particule
                     •
                   is declared) wherin a man is bound in consciēce to vse the refuge & help of this kind of doubtfull speach, or Equiuocatiō, for defence of innocēcy, and auoyding other greater inconueniences. And lastly the fifth consideration is of the great seuerity in detesting all sorts of lying both great and small, mortall, and veniall, which those men had, that permitted notwithstanding the vse of Equiuocation, as S. Augustine & others, in such a rigour, as for sauing a mans life, either our owne, or our neighbours, we ought not to commit the least sort of lying that can be imagined, which is an euidēt argumēt, that they did distinguish between lying and Equiuocation, which M. Morton euery where holdeth to be the same, and would haue vs to be of that mind too. And for approuing the one condemneth vs of the other, against all right, and reason as you see.
               25. And these were my first fiue Considerations

for stopping M. Mortons clamours, exaggerations, and exclamations, and reducing him to a more moderate temper in treating this controuersie.
                     Preamble p. 82.83. And it had byn good, that in this his Reply he had bestowed some

                   hath not answered any thing at all to these fiue considerations, at least foure of thē, nor yet so much as mentioned them in this his last Reply, nor giuen notice to the Reader, that any such thing was

                  et downe in my behalfe.
               26. Next vnto this entring into the substance of the matter it selfe, I do discusse the principall points belonging to this controuersy,
                     Mitig. c. 8. & 9. p. 307 as namely what Eq
                        •
                     iuocation truly is: what is the definitiō of truth; what of falsit
                     •
                  e; what of lying: what differēces they haue, and wherin they do agree, shewing the same by many reasons, & authorities not only of Philosophers, where the matters do appertaine vnto them, but out of ancient holy Fathers also, and variety of examples taken out of holy Scriptures, and of the wordes and factes of Christ our Sauiour, and his Apostles themselues: and this very largely, and copiously throughout diuers Paragraphes, wherby it is made most euident that the holiest men that euer were vpon earth, did equiuocate sometimes in their speaches,Forcible proofes for equiuocation. and vsed clauses of reseruatiō in a far different sense from that which the hearer did apprehend. And yet for that they had a true meaning in their owne mind, it cannot be reprehended without impiety, both in respect

of their excellent persons for sanctitie, and the receiued sentence of S. Augustine, Non facit linguam ream, nisi mens rea;
                     Aug. ser. 28. de verbis Apostol.
                   Nothing maketh the tongue guilty of lying but a guilty mind, when one thing is meant, and another spoken.
               27. As for example when S. Iohn Baptist was dem
                     •
                  nded, Propheta es tu? Are you a Prophet?
                     Ioan. 1. and he answered, No. And yet doth Christ call him a Prophet expresly Luc. 7. And so did Zacharie his Father,
                     See mitig. c 9. §. 2. pag. 362. & deinceps.
                   before he was borne Luc. 1. yea more then a Prophet Matth. 11. which is shewed to import as much as whē a Priest is vnlaw
                     •
                  ully demaunded, Are you a Priest? And he answereth, No: for as S. Iohn Baptist had a mē
                  tall reseruation in his wordes, and therby an Equiuocation (as is shewed out of the exposition of Origen, S. Chrysostome, S. Cyril, S. Augustiue, Theophilact, Euthymius, Rupertus and others) so saith the Priest in his answere: and consequently Equiuocation is a different thing from lying,
                     Full satisf. p. 48.49. and not so hellish, heathenish, heynous, & monstrous, as intēperatly M. Mort. calleth it.
               28. After this do follow many other examples, as that of our Sauiour in S. Iohns gospel, Ego non iudico quē
                     quam: I do not iudge any one. And yet himselfe saith in the same gospell, Pater omne iudiciū dedit 
                        •
                     ilio,
                  
                     Ioan. 8. my Father hath giuen all iudgmēt vnto (me) his Sōne.
                     Ioan. 5. And againe in the Actes of the Apostles S. Peter auoucheth that Christ is appointed Iudg by God his Father, both of the quick & the dead: which S. Paul cōfirmeth in diuers places,
                     Act. 10 as Rom. 13. 1. Cor. 3. So as that first 
                     •
                  peach of Christ that he iudged no man, cannot be verified, but by a mentall reseruation: which what it was, the holy Fathers and expositors do labour to explicate. And the like to this, is that speach of Christ, of the daughter of the Archisinagogue,
                     Math. 9.
                  
                     Marc. 5. 
                  The maid is not dead but asleep, and yet she was truly dead:
                     Luc. 8. and the hearers were deceiued in Christs meaning, which could not be true,

nor was held for true in the literall & externall meaning, but by some mentall reseruation, which S. Augustine, and other holy Fathers do labour to seeke out what it was; and in 
                     •
                  hat sense it was to be vnderstood. And many other exāples to like effect are produced, and discussed, both out of the old and new Testament, wherby it is made more cleare then the sunne, that this kind of speach in answering by Equiuocation and doubtfull speach when need requireth, that is to say, when one sense soundeth in the wordes conceaued by the hearer, and another is reserued in the mind of the speaker vpon iust causes, is no lye, but a truth, and most lawfull, & that it were impiety, and blasphemy to hold or say the contrary in sundry persons, and speaches, which holy Scriptures do recount.
               29. Now then why hath not M. Morton in this his last Reply giuen some satisfaction about this great debt:When T. M. is like to pay this debt. I know his answere will be, to say, that he will do it in his promised Reioynder, which shall be his last day of payment: but there remayneth to be considered, what liklyhood there is, that he will be able to pay at that day: especially for so much as he hauing in his last full Satisfaction attempted to answere some like places alleaged before in a litle

Morton, that Equiuocation is to be freed both from the name and nature of lying, falsity or falshood. All which in like manner is concealed by him in this his friuolous Preamble.

And last of all I do conclude with a large exhortatiō to Catholike people, that notwithstanding the lawfulnes of Equiuocatiō in sundry cases: yet for the seeming iniustice, that it may appeare to haue, and therby also giue disedification to them, that vnderstand not the true ground & reason of the lawfulnes: for this cause (I say) and for that in confession of our faith (wherof the necessity is frequent in these our dayes of persecution) it is no wayes to be admitted or tollerated: therefore I do counsell them to be very sparing in vsing the liberty of this Equiuocation, when they are not pressed therunto, for auoiding some greater euill.
               31. All which limitations, restrictions, and explications of our Christian sincere meaning, and hatred of lying, M. Morton doth conceale from his Reader,M. Mort. iniquity in dealing maliciously with vs. & still cryeth out, that we are Patrons of lying, no

                   will he conceale it from the Reader, and go on with his clamour, as before: nay, which is more strange, he will make proclamation, as he doth in this his preamble, that he hath gayned the victory in both

causes, as well of Rebellion, as of Equiuocation: and yet hath he in effect said no more about the former,
                     Act. 5. but what you haue heard touched before, which is plain nothing. And cōcerning the second, he hath chosen out the Example only of the poore woman Saphyra, that according to his imagination answered to S. Peter in the Acts of the Apostles with an Equiuocation, concerning the selling of her landes, but as we hold and proue, with a lye, and not with Equiuocation. And what is this to so long and large a discourse as mine was? Wherfore M. Mortons voluntary omissions in this matter are notorious, & in my iudgement are

               OTHER OMISSIONS OF M. Morton cōcerning the defence of ten other Protestāt writers charged with false dealing: which defence being remitted ouer vnto him, was wholy pretermitted & concealed by him. §. III.
               IN the the 12. and last Chapter of my Treatise of Mitigatiō, for that M. Mort. had cōtinually in his former pāphlets & Treatises both o
                        •
                      Discouery & Full satisfactiō
                   inueighed bitterly against all kind of Equiuocatiō as falshood & lying, and against Catholicks, as louers, & fautors therof; I thought best to descend vnto some particulers with him, for the remouing this vniust reproach, and for laying it where it was due, to wit, vpon Protestant-writers themselues, granting, that as in a large sense, and vnproperly, Equiu
                     •
                  cation might be called lying and deceyuing, when the due conditions and circumstances of true Equiuocation are not obserued (which are, to haue

a iust cause, and true meaning;) so I said, that this kynd of vnlawfull Equiuocati
                     •
                   doth alwayes lightly fall vpon the Protestant side, and not vpon Catholiks. Which as I had shewed before in multiplicity of occasions against M. Morton himselfe (as now you haue seeme and heard in the 
                     •
                  ormer eleuen Chapters of that booke of Mitigation:) so in this last, I thought it not amisse to assigne him some parteners in his cō
                  demnation shewing that others also of his brethren were of like spirit in lying with him, though perhaps himself had out-gone most of them now in that damnable liberty.
               33. And then for more easy vnderstanding herof I deuided Equiuocation into two sortes, the one lawfull, & the other vnlawfull, as hath byn said: and this vnlawfull, I subdeuided againe (as also lying) into materiall and formall vnlawfull Equiuocation
                     •
                   the later being much more heynous then the former: for that the speaker knoweth that he doth vniustly deceaue by Equiuocation. And albeit I do exemplify there in many particulers against M. Morton, wherin I do chalenge him to haue often vsed the worst sort of these formall lying Equiuocations, whilest he impugneth the other sort, that lawfully and without lying is vsed some tymes, and in some cases by Catholiks, and was by the Apostles, Prophets, and Christ himself, as now you haue heard,
                     Supra. c. 1. §. 4. yet in this his Reply he pretermitting to answere to the things themselues obiected, picketh only quarrels at the forme of the diuision and subdiuision, as you may see before in our first Chapter, where the matter is hādled largely and the cauill layd open, and refuted. But to the end that M. Mort. omissions, and sly dealing in the principall poyntes may better appeare, it shal not be amisse perhaps to set downe some particulers wherwith he was charged at that time.

This then is formally to lye, and Equiuocate in the worst and superlatiue degree of false Equiuocation.
                  
                  
                     36. About which point the Reader may be remitted to the second Chapter of this treatise, & last Paragraph therof, where he shall see diuers exāples layd togeather, and among other, that which he reporteth of the death of our English Pope Adrian choaked (as he saith) with a flye, and citeth Nauclerus for the same: who though he mention, yet refuteth expresly that

And the same is demonstrated by many exāples most apparent, & euident throughout the whole sixt Chapter of this booke, and other places: so as if we had no
                           •
                         other proofe of this spirit, but in Tho. Morton himself, it were sufficient to proue our purpose, for that of all other lightly of his coate, he professeth most innocency, simplicity, and sincerity in this behalfe, & by this doth principally proue our purpose, which is, that they Equiuocate & lye, both wittingly & willingly, & then most of all, whē they make greatest protestation of truth.
                  
                  
                     38. As when T. M. talketh of his naked innocency in his Epistle to the Kings Maiesty, of detesting Equiuocation from his soule, of styling himself A Minister of simple truth: & finally his vsurping of those protestations of S. Paul before mētioned, That in all things he spake the truth, and lyed not, which Thomas Morton, as we often haue proued before, could not choose but know to be a wilfull lye indeed, hauing seene & read the A

                        thors which so manifestly he be

                        yeth, as neuer in this he will be able to cleare himselfe. And heerof we do fynally inferre, that he and his do equiuocate in the worst kynd, which by vs and ours is neuer vsed: and so while he declameth against law
                           •

                     39. And for that this matter is of so great importance for the Reader well to conceaue in these dayes of controuersyes betweene vs,Asigne distinctiue betweene Protestāts and vs. I meane to stay my self somewhat in this Chapter vpon this point, & to shew that indeed it is a substantiall signe distinctiue betweene all Sectaries and Vs, at this tyme, and

                        quiuocations, where not only vntruth is vttered, but it is wittingly also vttered, the writer knowing that he writeth vntruth, as often now hath bene said. Which manner of dealing inferreth two pointes: the one that such a writer or speaker hath no conscience that vttereth things against his owne knowledge, and which God seeth to be false, and falsely meant in his hart: and the other that his cause hath no ground of substantiall truth, which cannot be defended without such wilfull lyes.
                  
                  
                     40. In this thē if you please let vs insist a while, & let Tho. Mort. bring forth any Catholicke Author whatsoeuer, that wrote against Protestants since these heresyes began, that hath bene taken in this impiety, I meane, that hath set downe in print any such falsity, as cannot be excused eyther by ignorance, ouersight, negligence, errour of print, translation, diuersitie of editions,A iust chalenge to M. Mort. or the like, but that it must needes be presumed that he knew the vntruth, and yet would set it

                        orth: of this kind (I say) let him shew me bu
                           •
                         one example among all Catholike writers of our time, and I will in my conscience greatly mistrust and discredit the Author, whether it be another or my selfe: but if he shew me two or three in any writer of this kind, I shall neuer be able to belieue him more. And wheras the number and variety of Catholike writers is so great as the world seeth, it were

no great labour to shew it in some, if that spirit did raigne amongst them, as it doth in Protestāt writers, out of whom great volumes might be framed of this one point, if a man would imbrace them all throughout all nations: but I meaning to speake of Englishmen, and those very few in respect of the multitude, and not hauing all their workes by me at this presēt, am forced only to vse some few notes taken heertofore out of their bookes, which notwithstanding shall suffice for this short view, which we pretend. And for better methode & memory, I haue thought good to reduce my notes at this time to three sortes of men, that haue written against vs. First Protestāt Bishops: then Ministers: and 
                           •
                        astly Lay-men, but of good sort, I meane Knightes: and of ech one of these shall we make our seuerall paragraphs.
                  
                  41. Thus farre I wrote at that tyme: and as for the first part of that which I did set downe, that M. Morton had byn taken in many and inexcusable false Equiuocations, which in effect are the same with lying; if before it was euident by the particuler examples heere alleaged and many others, I do presume that now it will be much more manifest after his Reply, and this my reioynder made vnto the same. For that not only his former faults cōmitted in this kind in his former Treatises o

And finally I adioyne to the former, for my last witnesse of false dealing, Syr Edward Cooke late Attorney Generall to his Maiesty,Syr Edward Cooke. and not long since manifesting himselfe to the world for a writer against Catholiks, whose spirit I do shew by sundry examples to be like the rest in that behalfe: leauing the defence both of him, and the others to M. Mortons patronage, who hath had so litle care of their credit, as it seemeth, that he hath not so much as once mētioned them, or any one of thē in this his Reply, but leaueth euery one to shift for himselfe, which omission cannot but seeme somewhat preiudiciall vnto them, for that euery man will therof inferre, that their causes were so bad, as he durst not take their defence in hand: but especially will this seeme to be true in the cause of Syr Edward Cooke, whome M.

                  th part of his Reportes: the other, the Treatise of Mitigation, with the like imputations of vntrue dealing, as are laid against M.

Cooke to furnish one whole Chapter of his full Satisfaction,

Cooke himselfe hauing set forth a certaine Preface for some excuse of himselfe, and this after my Treatise of Mitigation (wherin he was so deeply charged with sundr
                     •
                   grosse and willfull falshoods) had byn seene and read by him, and yet to say neuer a word of this charge, nor how he could discharge it: this silence (I say) is no lesse strāge vnto me then the other of M. Morton, but rather more, for that Syr Edward was to defend himself, M. Morton another: & propria magis premunt, our owne affayres do more presse vs then other mens. Wherfore to the end that I may somewhat oblige both M. Morton in his promised Reioynder to be more myndfull of this matter, and Syr Edward himself (if he meane to write any more Bookes against vs) to cleare somewhat this Charge that was layd against him, I shall repeate the same againe here as it was there set downe in my other Treatise: Thus thē I wrote at that tyme.
               50. Our last example (said I) shall be of Syr Edward Cooke lately the Kings Attorney,
                     Mitig. p. 535. who hauing taken vpon him these yeares past to be both a sharpe writer and earnest Actor against Catholicks,The Charge layd against Syr Edward Cooke. semeth therwith also to haue drunke of this spirit in such aboūdant measure, as he is like in time to ouerrunne all the rest, if he go foreward as he hath begunne. For that being admonished not long a goe, by one that answered his last Booke of Reportes, of diuers notorious his excesses committed in this kind, he is (men say) so far of from correcting or amending the same as he hath not only in a late large declamatiō against Catholiks,

                        •
                     truth which he had wrytten and printed, that for the first

tenne yeares of Q. Elizabethes Raigne, no one person of what religion or Sect soeuer did refuse to go to the Protestants Church & Seruice: which the Answerer confuteth so clearly & by so many witnesses, as a man would haue thought that the matter would neuer haue byn mentioned more for very shame: and yet now (they say) that the Attorney being made a Iudge hath not only repeated the same, but auouched it also againe with such asseueration in his foresaid Charge, as if it had neuer byn controlled or proued false.
               
               
                  51. Nay further they wryte, that he adioyned with like asseueration diuers other things, no lesse apparantly false then this: As for example:A notable fiction against Pius V. 
                     that Pope Pius Quintus before he proceded to any Ecclesiasticall Censure against Q. Elizabeth wrote vnto her a Letter, offering to allow & rati

                        y the English Seruice, Bible and Communion booke, as now it is in vse in that kingdome, if she would accept it as from him: which she refusing to doe, he did excōmunicate her. By which tale he acquiteth notwithstanding Catholiks (if you marke it) from procuring that Excommunication for rebellion, which elswhere he oftē obiecteth most odiously against them. For if vpon this cause she were excommunicated, what part had Catholicks therin? But yet I must needs say, that the fiction is one of the most vnlikely things, and the most impossible in morall reason, that any man can deuise. For that Pope Pius Quintus, albeit some man would imagine him to be so good a fellow, as to care for no Religiō (who is knowne to haue byn most zealous) yet had he aduentured his Popedome by making such an offer.
                        Decret. p. 1. dist. 40. ca. 6. Si Papa. For he should haue allowed of diuers points in the Cōmunion booke, which are held by the Catholicke Church for heresy, and so condemned by the Councell of Trent and other Councells. And now you know it is a ground among vs, that a Pope that should be an Hereticke, or approue of heresy,

thereby ceaseth to be Pope: how improbable then is this of Pius Quintus his offer? And why had not this Letter in so many yeares byn published to the world for the credit of the English Seruice, and discredit of the Popes? And yet the voice is, that the Lord Cooke did so earnestly auouch this matter, as he pawned therein not only his credit and honesty by expresse termes of protestation, but euen his

                        aith also to God and man: a great aduēture no doubt. And for that I assure my self that the greater part of the Auditory being discreet men, did imagine it to be quite false, as I and others in effect do know it to be: it mu

                     udgship, that in other things also he be not belieued.
               
               
                  52. But I vnderstād that the Booke of this speach or charge now printed is expected shortly,The L. Cookes charge against Catholickes. togeather with some other appertayning to the same man, and then it may be, that some body will examine matters more particulerly (especially those that appertaine to the iniuring of Catholicks) and afterward returne with the agrieuances to the Iudge him selfe (seing he is now a Iudge) to giue sentence of his owne ouersightes. Albeit I must confesse that as well my selfe, as diuers other men haue lost great hope of his Lordship by this accidēt: for before we did thinke that his ouerlashing in speaches when he was Attorney did proceed in great part of the liberty of that office, and that when he came to be Iudge he would reforme his Consciēce ratione Status, in regard of his state of life: but now it seemeth that he is far worse: though this I say shalbe left by me to others to be discussed vpon the sight of the foresaid printed Bookes.
               
               
                  53. My speach at this time shall be only about that which passed in his Booke of Reportes while he was

Attorney, and which hath byn disputed these monethes past betweene him and a Catholicke Deuine of our party in his answere to the said Reports, which Answere is in England. And albeit thereby may easily be seene the talēt which M. Attorney had, while he was Attorney in this kind of worst Equiuocation (notwithstanding his often declamations against the other sort, that with due circumstances we haue proued to be lawfull) yet will I heere adioyne one example more, but such a one as is worth the noting and bearing away.
And it is this.
               
                  54. That whereas in answering of diuers lawes, statutes and ordinances which the Attorney alleaged out of the Raignes of sundry ācient Kinges, to proue that they did exercise spirituall authority and iurisdiction, the Deuine sometymes not hauing the law bookes by him out of which the said lawes or authorities were cyted, supposing the allegations to be ordinarily true (
                        •
                     or who would suspect lawiers to be false in their citations,The Deuine deceiued by the subtility of the Lawyer. that were wont to be accompted most exact in that point) did answere the same with that sincerity of truth and reason, as to a man of his profession apperteyned: though sometymes also he was forced to suspect some fraude, and therepon requested such as had commodity in England to see the Bookes, that they would peruse the places and take them out Verbatim: which some haue done, and haue found such store of Equiuocations and false dealing in the alleaging therof, as neuer could be imagined in a man of his calling. I shal only set down one example, and it shal be the first that is cited by him in the whole Booke, to wit, of the Charter of King Kenidphus of the VVest Saxons, vnto the Abbey of Abindon in Barkshire; which Charter M. Attorney set downe with this Preface. To confirme (saith he) those that hold the truth, and to satisfy such as being

not instructed know not the ancient and moderne lawes &c. these few demonstratiue prooses shall serue.
                  
               
               55. And then beginneth he with the said Charter of king Kenulphus before the cōquest,K. Kenulphus his charter notably falsified by M. Att. Reports fol. 9. meaning to proue therby, that the said king did giue vnto the said Abbey of Abindō spirituall iurisdiction by vertue of his temporall Crowne, exempting the same from all authority of the Bishop: which indeed was done by the Pope; and so the Charter it self doth plainly expresse, if it had byn truly related by M. Attorney.
                  And for that the Case is not long I shall set it downe Verbatim, as the Attorney hath it in his Booke pag. 9. only putting into English that which is recited by him in Latin, and left without any translation to make the matter more obscure: & then shall we lay forth also the true Case, whereby wilbe seene how true a dealer M. Attorney is in those his writyngs and protestations, which after we shall more largely consider of. Thus then beginneth the Charter.

                  57. King Kenulphus &c. by his letters Patents with the Counsayle & consent of the Bishops and Counsaylours of his Nation, did giue to the Monastery of Abindon in Barkeshire, and to one Ruchinus Abbot of that

Monastery a certaine portion of his land, to wit,

                     is credit & honour in this behalf, granting all as it lay, answered the same as you may see in his Booke. But now vpō better search it falleth out, that this whole Case was falsely alleaged by M. Attorney in the very point of the principall Cōtrouersy in hand about the Kings spirituall Iurisdiction: for that whatsoeuer the Char

                     ter did ascribe expresly to the Pope and his authority, the Attorney suppressing the true words, relateth it as proc
                        •
                     eding from the King & temporall authority of his Crowne. For proofe wherof I shall set downe the very words of my learned frēds letter out of England about this point, after view taken of the law bookes themselues: and then let any man say, how far M. Attorney is to be credited in any thing he writeth or speaketh against Catholicks.
               
               60. As concerning (saith my friend) the Charter of King Kenulphus for the Sanctuary of the Monastery of Abindon,
                  The relation sent out of England about the true charter of K. Kenulphus. you must know that M. Attorney hath egregiously abused his Reader in that and other pointes: for the Case standeth thus.
That in the first yeare of King Henry the 7. Humfrey Stafford was attainted by Act of Parlament of high treason, & tooke Sanctuary first in Colchester in Essex, and after fled to Culnam, and tooke Sanctuary in the Abbey of Abindon: and being taken from thence brought vnto the Tower of London, and from thence brought vnto the Kings Bench he pleaded that he was drawne by force out of the said Sāctuary of Culnam: and praied his Counsaile to pleade that point: which by all the Iudges of both Benches was granted vnto him. And so they pleaded in this manner.
               
               
                  91. Idem Humphridus per Consilium suum dixit, quòd Kenulphus Rex Merciorū per Literas suas patētes, consilio & cōsensu Episcoporū & Senatorū gentis suae largitus suit Monasterio de Abindon, accuidam Ruchino tunc Abbati Monasterij illius, quandam

Attorney leauing out as you see in his recitall the wordes that go before ab omni Regis obstaculo, that the Monastery should be free from all obstacle of the King, as also these words: vt inhabitatores eius nullius Regis aut Ministrorū suorum iugo deprimantur: that the inhabitāts be not opprest with any yoake of any King or his Ministers. Wherby is euidēt that the King in his Charter did for his part giue exemptions from temporall and Royall power But especially the fraud is seene by cutting of the wordes that do ensue, which decide the whole controuersy, which are these.

And the Lord Brooke in his Abridgement of the law, in the title of Corone, placito 129. doth accordingly set downe the same Case, with mentioning of the Bulles of Pope Leo for the said immunities and priuileges. But all the Protestant editions in the tyme of the late Quene Elizabeth printed by Tottell and Yestwort haue committed a notable tricke of falsification,A falsification of Protestā

                  63. And hereby also is euident, that the King did not by his Charter in Parlament (for it appeareth to be made by the Counsaile and consent of his Bishops and Senators & not by Parlam
                        •
                     nt, as M. Attorney doth misreport it) neither was there any Parlament held at that time in the land, or many hundreth yeares after (for as it appeareth by Holinsheads Chronicle pag. 34. the first vse of Parlaments in England was in the tyme of King Henry the first:When Parliamentes began in England.) it is cleare (I say) that the King did not discharge and exempt the said Abbot from Iurisdiction of the Bishop, nor did grant vnto the said Abbot Ecclesiasticall Iurisdictiō within the said Abbey, neyther had that abbot any Ecclesiasticall

Iurisdictiō deriued frō the Crowne: But as it appeareth by the authētike report of the Case, the Pope & the King did ioyne both in making the said Sanctuary, according to their seuerall powers & authorityes. So that the exemptiō from Episcopall Iurisdictiō proceeded duly from the grant of Pope Leo: as likewise the exēption frō all Regall & temporall Iurisdiction proceeded frō the Charter of King Kenulphus. Note also that King Edwins Grant was only that the said Monastery should be free from all earthly seruitude, & toucheth not any spirituall immunities or Iurisdiction at all.
               
               
                  
                     The conclusion.64. Thus far my friend out of England: and by this now you may see, how well M. Attorney hath obserued his foresaid protestation: that he had cyted the very wordes & textes of the Lawes, without any inference, argument or amplification at all. And this being my friends aduertisment from England with like obseruation of manie other places cyted by M. Attorney with like fydelity, I thought good to produce this one amongst manie (being the first in order) for a tast in this place, reseruing the rest to a fitter, or at leastwise to a second edition of the foresaid answere of the Catholike Deuine, where euery thing may be referred to his due place: and with this will I end this Chapter.
Thus far wrote I at that tyme in charg of Syr Edward.

               70. Thus far M. Morton out of Syr Edward Cooke: then he addeth: Many other examples of like nature I pretermit, and remit the Reader desirous to be further satisfied, vnto the booke o
                        •
                      Reportes: habet enim ille quod det, & dat nemo largiùs. For he hath to giue, and no man giueth more aboundantly. This is his Encomium: But what doth he giue? truth or falshood? sincere or wrested allegatiōs? matter to the purpose or impertinent? That we shall here now discusse, & shew that neither the exāples themselues are altogeather true as here they are set downe: nor if they were, yet doe they not prooue the purpose, for which they are alleaged: And first we shall proue the second which most importeth: and it is easily proued.
               71. For first Syr Edwards purpose & obligation was to proue, that Q. Elizabeth by force of her temporall Crowne had all manner of Supreme authority in spirituall affaires, no lesse then any person euer had, did, or could exercise in England, as the words of the Statute haue, alleaged by him: and the purpose of M. Morton was as appeareth by the title of his Treatise, to improue the Popes supreme authority in Causes Ecclesiasticall: So as both their ends and purposes were by different meanes to proue, that the Pope had no supreme authority in Ecclesiasticall matters for time

past in England: the one by ascribing all to the King: the other by denying it to the Pope. But this purpose of theirs either in the one or the other point is not proued by any one of all these examples, nor by them altogeather, though they were granted to be true as here they lye. For that they do not proue, that either our Kings here mentioned did assume to thēselues to haue Supreme authority in spirituall affaires, or to take it from the Pope: nay the Catholike Deuine in answering to Syr Edwards obiections herein, doth euidently shew and proue, yea conuinceth, that these fiue English Kings here mentioned, to wit, King Edward the first, Edward the third, Richard the second, Henry the fourth, & Edward the fourth, vnder whom these Cases fell out, did all of them most effectually acknowledge the Popes supreme authority in Ecclesiasticall matters, and were obedient Children to the same, as he shewed by sundry most cleare and apparant examples of their owne actiōs towards the Sea Apostolike: and that these particuler Cases, supposing they were all true, and fell out as heere they are set downe, to wit, that the publishing of a Bull of Excommunication in some Causes, and vnder some King might be held for Treason: as also that the Archbishops lands might be seysed vpon for refusing to admit the Kings presented Clerke: & that in Parlament it was said, that the Regality of the Crowne of England depended not of Rome: and that in certaine Cases no suites might be made thither, without recourse first to the Ordinaries of England.
               
               72. Albeit I say that these things were all granted as they lie,False inferences. yet do they not inferre by any true cō
                  sequence that which the Knight and Minister should proue, to wit: that for this either these kings were, or held themselues for supreme in spirituall authority at that tyme, or that it was denied vnto the Pope.

Wherof this one is a most conuincent argument, that the like Cases do or may fall out at this day in other Catholicke Countries and Kingdom
                     •
                  s, as in France, Spaine, Naples, and Sicily, where 
                     •
                  here be diuers Concordates, res
                     •
                  rictions & limitations agreed vpon for auoyding further inconueniēces betweene the Pope and Catholicke Kings and Princes, concerning the manner of execution of Ecclesiasticall authority, without any derogation to the Supremacy therof in the Pope. And so might men be punished by the said Princes for breaking rashly the said agreements, as they may and are dayly in the said Kingdomes, especially in the last: and yet do not these Kings thereby either deny the Popes supreme authority, or take it to themselues (as M. Attorney & M. Morton do falsely ininferre) in these our cases. And thus it is manifest, that albeit these exāples were in all r
                     •
                  spects truly alleaged: yet are they impertinent to proue that which is pretended. And this for the first point.
               
                  False dealing.73. But neither is it all true, that heere is set down, nor as it is set downe, which is the second point to be considered. For which cause though I find these fyue Cases sufficiently answered by the Catholicke Deuine in his late Booke against M. Attorney: y
                     •
                  t for t
                     •
                  at the said Knight in his last Preface to the sixt part of his Reports, doth say that he fyndeth him vtterly ignorant in the lawes of the Realme (though as a Deuine he made no profession to be skilfull in the same) yet shall I adde somewhat to the reuiew of these Cases: whereby it may appeare at leastwise, whether he, to wit, the Deuine, or M. Attorney, or M. Morton haue vsed the skill of their professions with more sincerity in this matter.
               
                  The 1. case againe discussed.74. The first Case th
                     •
                  n is thus set downe by M. Morton, out of the Attorneys booke, though not altogether as it lyeth in his booke, but with some aduantage,

as the Attorney did out of his Bookes whereof he tooke his Case.
                     Full satisf. par. 3. pag. 41. Reports part. 1. fol. 12. Mitig. p. 267. So as here is helping the dye on all hāds as you see. In the Raigne of King Edward the first (saith M. Morton) a Subiect brought in a Bull of excommunicati
                        •
                      against another Subiect of this Realme and published it: But it was answered, that this was then according to the ancient lawes of England treason &c. as before is set downe.
               75. Wherein I must note first, before I come to examine the answere already made, that M. Mortō
                   can not choose, as it seemeth, but to vse a tricke or two of his art of iugling, euen with M. Attorney himself. For whereas he relateth (to with the Attorney) that this Bull of excommunication was published to the Treasurer of England,T.M
                        •
                      clipping of hi
                        •
                      Author. 
                  M. Morton clyppeth of all mē
                  tion of the Treasurer, which notwithstāding in this Case is of great moment: for so much as it semeth that if he had published the same to the Archbishop or Bishops appointed to haue the view of such things and had brought their authenticall testimonies for the same, it seemeth by the very booke it self of Iustice Thorpe, who recounteth this Case by occasion of the Case of Syr Thomas Seaton and Lucy, 30. E. 3. that it had byn litle or no peril at all vnto the publisher; for that this reason is alleaged for the offence therein committed:30. Ed. 3. l. Ass. pl. 19. 
                  that for so much as the partie (to wit, Lucie against Syr Thomas Seaton) did not shew any writ of excommunication, or any other thing sealed by the Archbishop of England, nor any other Seale that was authentike prouing this: therfore the Bull was not allowed &c.
               
               76. This then was a fine tricke,
                     Brooke in his Abridgment, tit. Praemunire pl. 10. to cut of all mentiō of the Treasurer: the other also immediatly following hath some subtilitie in it, though not so much as the former, to wit, that it was answered, that this was Treason &c. for that in none of the bookes cited either of Thorpe or Brooke is any mention of such answere giuen, as M. Morton feygneth: nor any such

iudgment of Treason passed theron, as M. Attorney would make his Reader belieue, as presētly shall be proued: So as these are the first two trickes of M. Morton, to helpe his dye: all the rest for the substance of the matter is like to fall vpon M. Attorney.
               
               
                  
                     Answere to the Reports pag. 
                     
                        •
                     67.77. First then the Answere of the Deuine vnto this Case (not hauing commoditie at that time to see the two bookes of Thorpe and Brooke cyted in the margent) was, that it could not possibly be imagined, by reason that the Case stood altogeather as M. Attorney did set it downe, esp
                     •
                  cially with this note in the margēt, that the bringing in of a Bull against a subiect was Treason by the ancient cōmon lawes of England, before any Statute law was made therof: for that the Deuine demandeth what this Common law was, not made by Statute? How was it made? By whome? Where? At what time? Vpon what occasion? How introduced and commonly receiued (for all this a Common law supposeth) especially for so much as the said Deuine had shewed and aboundantly proued now,The Deuines resō against the probability of the Attorneys assertion. that all precedent Kings of England both before and after the Conquest were most Catholicke in this very point of acknowledging the Popes supreme and vniuersall authority in spirituall affaires, wherof the power of excommunication throughout the world vpon iust causes is a principall member: so as except they would introduce a law contrary to their owne beliefe, or suffer a law to grow and be made cōmon in their Realme without their knowledge or assent, it is absurd to imagine that there could be such a Common law against the Popes Excōmunications before the dayes of King Edward the first, and before any Statute was made against the same, as M. Attorney auoucheth.
               78. Secondly he sheweth out of the testimony of Matth. VVestmonast. that this King Edward being in a

great heat of offence against the Cleargy of England,
                  
                     VVestmō. in hist. anno 1197. for that they denied to giue him the halfe of their Rents and goods towards his warres, vpon the expresse prohibition of Pope Bonifacius to the contrary: which prohibition some Cleargie men vpon feare transgressing, had compounded & made their peace with the King in that behalfe, he doubting least some of the other part of the Cleargy would bring in an Excōmunicatiō against him, or against some of those that had compounded with him, made a Decree (saith VVestmonaster.) commanding vnder payne of imprisonment, that no man should publish any sentence of Excommunication against the King himselfe, or those that had newly sought his protection: he making also a prouocation or appeale as well for himselfe, as those that stood on his side, to the Court of Rome. Thus he.A conuincing argument against M. Attorney. 
                  And now let the prudent Reader consider (saith the Deuine) that if the King euen in his passion of choler did appoint but imprisonment, to be the punishment for bringing in an Excommunication against himselfe, and Cleargy men that stood with him, how vnlike is it, that by the common law it was treason against the King, his Realme, Crowne and dignity (as M. Attorneys thundring words are) to bring in an excommunication against a Subiect, which is much lesse, then against the Kings person himselfe.
               
               79. Thirdly the said Deuine, though he had not perused the law bookes at that time; yet did he yeld the true Cause, why priuate men might not bring in excōmunications and publish them at their pleasure, as now also is prohibited in other before named Catholicke Kingdomes: but they were to be shewed first to a Bishop, & vnder his Seale were to be certified vnto the Kings Courts: which since that time I haue foūd to be set down expresly in the lawbookes themselues and craftily concealed by M. Attorney: for thus is it found written 11. Henr. 4

Court, and for the mischeefe that ensued therof, it was aduised by the Parlamēt that none ought to certify excōmunication but only the Bishop, & soe it is vsed at this day. Thus far are Hanckefords words: wherby we may see why the partie that published a Bull to the Treasurer of England without the Bishops approbatiō incurred so high displeasure.
               80. Fourthly, the said Deuine doth conuince M. Attorney out of a Case alleaged by himself afterward in the 31. yeare of the Raigne of King Edward the third,
                     Reports fol. 15.31. E. 3. tit

                        •
                     he defendant, if he had not the Certificate of some Bishop within the Realme testifying this excommunication &c. VVhereby (saith he) it is made euident first, that priuate men were obliged to shew their Bulles vnto some Bishop, before they published the same: and secondly, it appeareth most clearly by the answers of the Iudges, that they held it not for treasō in those daies, nor made any such inferēce therof: for that their only resolution was this, that for lacke of this Certificate, the partie excōmunicated was not thereby disinabled to follow his plea in that Court:Note the force of this argument. without saying any one word of danger or punishment against him, that had pleaded the Popes Bull of excommunication: which they would neuer haue omytted to do, if 50 yeares before that, vnder K. Edward the first it had bin held for treason by the Cō
                  mon-law, to bring in or publish any Excommunication against a Subiect.
               81. This then was the substance of the Deuines answere at that tyme, which though it doth sufficiently conuince M. Attorney to haue abused his Reader egregiously in auouching with such resolution, that

in K. Edward the first his tyme, yt was by the ancient law of England, adiudged treason against the king, his Crowne and dignytie to publish any Bull of the Popes against any Subiect of the Realme: yet hauing synce that tyme had better commodity to informe my self of the lawbooks here mētioned, I wil adde some more proofes to those which now you haue heard.
               82. First then I must let the Reader vnderstand,An addition to the former answeres. that neither of those two bookes cited by M. Attorney lib. Ass. pl. 19.30. Ed. 3. and Brooke tit. Premunire pl. 10. neither of them, I say, doth affirme, that it was Treason, or that there was any iudgment of Treason giuen in that Case: which Case is related by Iustice Thorpe 30. Edwardi 3. thus. That wheras Syr Thomas Seaton sued a Bill in the Exchequer against a woman named Lucie for calling him Traytor,

                     e to be excommunicate, and therfore demanded Iudgement, whether he should be answered or not: And for that she did not shew any writ of excommunication, nor any other thing sealed by the Archbishop &c. the Bull was not allowed: whervpon she was forced to answere, and 
                        •
                     leaded not guilty. And in that plea Thorpe Iustice said, that in the tyme of the Grandfather of the King, which was K. Edward the first, 
                        •
                     or that one did notify an excommunication of the Apostle to the Treasurer of the King, the King would he should haue byn drawne and hanged, notwithstāding that the Chancelo

                        •
                     or him, yet by award he did abiure the Realme: and said that the woman was in a hard Case 
                        •
                     or shewing forth this excommunicatiō, if the king would. Thus far the said Book.
               83. VVherein we see first, that here is no answere made about treason as M. Morton affirmeth, nor iudgment giuen as M. Attorney auoucheth, nor any such inference

made by the Iudges: but only a case related, of what K. Edward the first in his anger would haue had to be done to a man, that presented an excommunication to the Treasurer, to wit, he would haue had him hanged and drawne about the same: which seming to his Iudges not to be iust, or according to law, did intreat the King not to put it in execution, but rather by way of award they made him abiure the Land (though this also was not due vnto him by rigour of law) to pacify thereby the Kings wrath. And it is not vnlike to that Case, that fell out in England Anno Domini 1578. vnder Q. Elizabeth, when in her anger she would haue had Peter Bourchet to haue byn put to death by Martiall law,
                  Peter Bourchets case anno 1578. when he had wounded Syr Iohn Hawkins insteed of Syr Christopher Hattō: but the Iudges would not yeald therunto, as being against law, & therefore found out this temperament, that he should be committed to the Tower, and accused of matters of Religion, as Puritanisme and the like. Where afterwards he gaue them a iust cause of putting him to death, by killing his keeper. But as the Queenes will & passion made this no law, so neither did that other vnder K. Edward the first. So as M. Attorney did much abuse his Reader in auerring it to be treason by the common law, & adiudged for such out of this Case.
               84. And if he will vrge that the punishment of hā
                  ging and drawing implieth treason; it is answered, no: but that this rather maketh much for vs. For that the punishment of treason (I meane high treason) is not only hanging and drawing but quart

I will adde foure seuerall Reasons & argumēts more out of the law-books themselues. The first is concerning the abiuring the Realme for pacifying  the King, awarded in iu

                  e election of the Offendours, and not at 
                     •
                  he will of the Prince. And afterward the said Stanford shewing for what offences in particuler a m
                     •
                  n might abiure the Realme, saith, that abiuration doth not lye 
                        •
                     or h
                        •
                     m that hath offended in high treason
               
               86. The second Reason is, that the said Stanford in  his said booke of the Pleas of the Crowne fol. 182. intē
                  ding to set down all offenc
                     •

                  e any such matter to be treason, as the bringing into the Realme Bulles of excommunication by one Subiect against an other: which he would neuer haue concealed, if he had found it held for such in any law booke before him.
               87. The third Reason is to the same effect, that 
                  
the Statute of 25. Ed. 3. being made for declaration of treasons, doth 
                     •
                  et downe what offences were treasons by the Common law. In this Statute, I say, no mention at all is made, that the bringing in of Bulls of excommunication was treason or any other offence: which of likelyhood cannot be presumed that they would haue pretermitted to touch or mention, if any such thing had bin.

Neither would any Counsel haue presumed to plead the same so often in the said Courts, if there had byn such perill or offence therein at that tyme as M. Attorney now pretendeth.Brooke in his abridgment tit

                     e. pl. 10. Neither doth the authority of Brooke here cyted by M. Attorney patronize him in his voluntary mistaking & misconstruyng of the law-books a foresaid: For that Brooke doth not say, that the bringing in of Bulls was iudged treason by law, as M. Attorney doth, but on

               89. Wherfore we must conclude that in this first Case M. Attorney hath sundry wayes dealt vnsincerly, and gone about to deceiue his Reader, making him belieue: that the bringing in & pleading of the Popes Bulles in ancient time was treason according to the Common-lawes: which being now proued to be

false, yet doth he so often repeate the same vpon all occasions against Catholikes both in wryting, speaking, pleading: and vbrayding: as if it were a most certaine truth or principle, and not to be controlled. Let vs see somewhat of the other Cases.
            
            
               TO THE OTHER FOVRE CASES obiected by M. Morton out of Syr Edward Cooke. §. VI.

And if he did not, the Aduowsoner might haue an Action against the said Bishop at the Commonlaw of Quare non admisit, as in a temporall Case: and if the Bishop could not excuse his not admitting of the Clerke of the Recouerer by some sufficient cause, then the Plaintif should recouer domages against the Bishop, or els he might haue vpon the not executing the first writ to the Bishop an Alias, or a Pluries against him.An Alias and Pluries.

                   that the King could by law do against him: for that he could neither imprison, nor depose, or degrade him, there being no presidēt to be found (as I suppose) of the first. And for the second, the law it sel

H. 4. fol. 14. Neither can (I thinke) M. Attorney alleage any example, where the same is prohibited either by Commō or Statute law, during the tyme aforesaid.

                  eth a Notandum for the same, as a matter notorious, he doth notoriously abuse his Reader:The true case set downe. For that Fitzh. speaketh not at all of a Premunire, but only, That if one sueth another out of the Realme for debt or other cause, wherof the kings Court may haue conusance, he shall haue a prohibition against him: And so if one Clearke sue an other vpon title of Collation o

matter. So you see, that all that Fitzherbert saith, is but that a prohibitiō shall lye, for suyng in the Court of Rome for debt or title of Patronage, or such other temporall Causes wherof the Kings Court may haue conusance: and he maketh no mention of any Premunire. And yet euery puny Studēt in the Law can tell how much difference there is betwixt a Premunire and a Prohibition: & that Syr Edward delt not sincerely, whē he brought in the one for the other.
               95. So then we soe what striuing & wresting, & worse vsage M. Attorney offereth to his law-bookes, to make them seeme to say somwhat against vs, and for Protestant religion, against which most of them were written, as all of them before our times without exception in fauour of the Catholicks. We see also the pittifull choice that M. Morton hath made of these fiue Cases out of all M. Attorneys Reportable Reports against the Popes supreme Ecclesiasticall authority.Fiue fond cōparings not worth a paring. But if we will consider the wise glosses Commentaries, and comparings which the Minister maketh very Ministerially vpon euery one of those  Cases after he hath related the same, it will appeare much more ridiculous. For to the first (which euidently conuinced both him and M. Attorney of falsitie if you remember, for affirming that to be treason by the Common law which is not) he saieth thus: Cō
                     pare  this Bull, which did only push at a Subiects benefice, with that Bull which goareth Kings. And to the second: Compare  this Bull of disturbans the Presentee of Kings, with that which doth ordinarily violate kings persons. And to the third: Compare  this English King imediatly not subiect to the Pope, with the Iesuiticall principle: All Kings are indir

                  on cōd parisons are founded, are foūd to be falsely applied as now hath byn shewed. Wherfore this hath not serued any whit to iustify his Cliēt or himselfe, but rather to confirme & aggrauate the former Charges giuen against them both. And it is to be considered, that if in these fiue Cases chosen out by M. Morton out of fiue & fifty cyted by M. Attorney against the Popes authority before King Hēry the 8. his Reigne, so many false tricks are found, what would the number be, if we should discusse all the rest with like suruey? Surely if M. Attorney might be presumed to haue dealt no more sincerely in the rest of his Reportes (wherof six seuerall parts are now published) then he hath done in these, concerning R

            THE EIGHT CHAPTER WHICH BY OCCASION OF TWO NEW PREFACES lately set forth by the sayd SYR EDWARD COOKE, doth handle diuers Controuersies, as well about a Nihil dicit, obiected by him to his Aduersary: AS also about the Antiquity, & Excellency of the Municipall Common lawes of England, and some other points.
            
                THE PREFACE.
               
                  AFTER I was well entred into this worke for answering M. Morton his Preamble, I came to the sight of a new Preface set forth by Syr Edward Cooke before the sixt Part of his Reportes, lately published: & for that the name and argument of Preamble and Preface came so ioyntly

togeather from two different Authors, and that the 
                     •
                  inall purpose of the one and the other t
                     •
                  erin (for so much as concerneth our subiect of Religion and iustifying themselues about that which they had written therof, to the slaunder & iniury of Catholick profes
                     •
                  iō) semed to me to be one & the very same; which was, to subtract their shoulders from the weight of the matter in answering the whole that was writt

                  Prefaces and Preambles insteed of bookes. and promising further 
                     •
                  reatise, to diuert the Readers attention from the principall busines, and to intertayne him with other fancies and generall tearmes, as though they had answered somewhat indeed. For this I thought yt not amisse to ioyne them also togeather in this my Reply; and as I had answered the one largely and particulerly, so to say somwhat also to the other: especially, for so much as notwithstanding this Preface came forth long after that the Author therof Syr Edward had seene my former Charge layd against him, in the last Chapter of my Treatise of Mitigatiō
                  ; yet heere doth he not only not answere any thing therunto, but neyther so much as mentioneth the same, as before hath beene said: only in this place he hath a certaine snatch at the Deuines answere against his Reportes: and I call it a snatch, for that it conteineth scarce one page against the others whole Booke of aboue 400. and yet doth he so confidently condemne his aduersary both of ignorance, and boldnes, as if he had confuted him indeed by a large conuincement; wherin yow shall heare his owne wordes.
               
                  In the preface to the 6. part of his Reports.2. VVhen I looked into the booke (sayth he) euer expecting some answere to the matter, in the end I 
                        •
                     ound the Author vtterly ignorant (but exceeding bold, as commonly those qualities concurre) in the lawes of the Realme, the only subiect of

the matter in hand: but could not fynd in all the booke any authority out of the bookes of the common lawes of the Realme, Acts of Parlament, or any legall, or iudiciall records, quoted or cited by him for the maintenance of any of his opinions or conceipts: wherupon (as in iustice I ought) I had iudgment giuen 
                        •
                     or me, vpon a Nihil dicit, and ther
                        •
                     ore cannot make any replication. 
                  
                     •
                  hus farre Syr Edward, wherin as yow see, he answered all that large worke of the Deuine in few words, cōdemning him of ignorance, boldnes, and of saying nothing at all, in so large a Discourse: but as for the former two points of ignorance and boldnes, and whether he cyted no one authority at all out of any law-books, shall be afterward discussed more particulerly: now only in this Paragraph shall we consider how true this last assertion is, that the Deuine said nothing at all, and that therupon Syr Edward had iudgment giuen for him vpon a Nihi
                        •
                      dicit.
               
            
            
               WHETHER the Catholicke Deuine might be iustly condemned of a Nihil dicit, or no? §. I.
               FIRST then for trying of this point
                     •
                   I would demaund, what Iudge gaue this iudgement, 
                     •
                  ith
                     •
                  r Syr Edward himselfe (for he is now a Iudge) or an other, and vpon what due information? If himselfe did giue sentence for himselfe, it may easily be excepted against, as suspected of partiality: for that no man, I thinke, can be both iudge and party, euen by Syr Edwards lawes (for according to those of Saint Edward I am sure he could not) in his owne cause. But if another Iudge gaue the sentence,

let vs know, who it was and vpon what proofes & groundes (for that such sentences, I suppose, are not yet brought to be arbitrary in England nor permitted to euery Iudges will, and liking, without any proofes or groundes at all:) which being supposed, I am content to stand heerin, not only to any Iudge that sitteth vpon any of his Maiesties Benches at this day, but euen to Syr Edward himselfe, with condition only that he will be content with patience to heare my reasons, which are these that ensue.
               4. First, a Iudgment of Nihil dicit cannot proceed, as I suppose, but vpon one of these two causes, that 
                     •
                  yther the party sayth nothing at all,Two causes inferring a Nihil dicit. as when one standing at the barre to answere for his life, will for sauing of his goods and lands vtterly hold his peace: or when he speaketh, his speach is nothing to the purpose. But neyther of these causes can be iustly alleaged in our case. Not the first, for that the Catholicke Deuines printed Answere is large, and conteyneth, as I haue said, aboue 400. pages in quarto. Not the second as now shall euidently be declared; ergo, no iudgment could passe in iustice vpon a Nihil dicit in behalfe of Syr Edward against the sayd Deuine.
               5. Now then, let vs come to demonstrate that the Catholicke Diuine did speake to the purpose in deed: for better vnderstanding wherof we must recall to memory, the true state of the question, and what Syr Edward Cooke, then Attorney, vpon his offer and obligation was to proue, to wit,The principall point, that Syr Edward must prooue. 
                  that Queene Elizabeth by the right of her temporall Crowne had supreme spirituall, & Ecclesiasticall authority ouer all her subiects, in Ecclesiasticall affayrs, as largely as euer any persō had or could haue in that Realme, and this by the common lawes of England before any Statute law was made in that behalfe. For proofe wherof the sayd Attorney pretended to lay forth

a great number of cases, examples, and authorityes out of his law-bookes, which he said should proue the ancient practice of this authority in Christian English Kings, both before and since the Conquest: which being his purpose, whatsoeuer his aduersary the Catholicke Deuine doth alleage substantially to ouerthrow this his assertion, and to proue that Q. Elizabeth neyther had, nor could haue this spirituall Authority, though she had beene a man; neither that any of her ancestours Kings and Queenes of Englād did euer pretend, or practice the like authority: this (I say) cānot be iudged to be frō the purpose, & much lesse a Nihil dicit. Let vs examine then the particulers.
               6. The Catholicke Deuine at his first entrance, for procuring more attention in this great and weighty controuersy betweene M. Attorney and him about the Spirituall power and authority ouer soules in the moderne English Church,
                     Answere to Report
                           •
                         in the Preface.
                   doth auerre the question to be of such moment, as that the determination of all other controuersies dependeth therof.The high importāce of this cō
                     trouersie. For that whersoeuer true 
                     •
                  pirituall authority and iurisdiction is found, there must needs be the true Church, to whom it appertaineth to determine of the truth of the doctrine taught therin, or in any other false Church or cōgregatiō, for approuing the one, & condemning the other. Wherof cōsequently also depēdeth euerlasting saluatiō, or condēnatiō of all those that belieue, or not belieue those doctrines.
               7. He sheweth further, that the life, & spirit, & essence of the true Church in this world, consisteth in this true iurisdiction of gouerning and directing soules by preaching, teaching, bynding, and absoluing from synne, administring true Sacraments, and the lyke. And that where this true power & Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction is not lawfully foūd, but eyther none at all, or violently assumed, there

wanteth this vitall spirit. Neyther is it any Church at all, but a Synagogue rather of Sathan: and therfore that the fir
                     •
                  t and chiefe care of euery Christian ought to be for sauing of his soule, (e
                     •
                  pecially in tymes of strife, contentions, and heresyes, as are these of ours) to study well this point, and to informe himselfe diligently therin: for if he fynd this, he fyndeth all: and i
                     •
                   he misse in this, he misseth in all. Nor is it possible for him to be saued.
               8. Moreouer he declareth, that as in England at this day there be three different professio
                     •
                  s of religion,Th

                     •
                  ant, the Puritan, and the Catholicke, all three clayming this true and vitall power o
                     •
                   Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction to be in their Congregations: so do they deriue the same from three different heads and fountaynes immediatly, though all pretend that mediatly at leastwise it commeth from God. The Prot
                        •
                     stants taking it from the Temporall Princes authority, giuen him from God by right of his Crowne, as here is taught by M. Attorney: The Puritans from the people gathered togeather in their congregation. The Catholicks from their Bishops, and Prelats descending by continuall succession from the Apostles, to whome they belieue that Christ first gaue heauenly power and iurisdiction for gouerning of soules, and especially to the cheefe Bishop Successor to S. Peter, and not vnto temporall Princes, or to lay people or popular Congregations made by themselues, who cannot properly be called Successours of the Apostles: and this difference, as it is mani
                     •
                  est, and euident; so is it of such weight, as it maketh these three sortes of men, and their Congregations, or Churches irreconciliable: for that which soeuer of these three partes hath this true iurisdiction Ecclesiasticall, hath therby the tru

                   a Christian Church in them. And that the tryall of all this dependeth of the discussion of this controuersie betweene M. Attorney and him. All this hath the Deuine in his first entrance. And did he not herin speake to the purpose? or can this be condemned for a Nihil di
                        •
                     it?

                  ter this for better vnderstāding of the whole controuersie, the Deuine layeth downe at large the ground, beginning and origen of all lawfull power and iurisdiction of men, ouer men,The origen and ordinance of both powers spirituall and temporall. both spirituall and temporall, in this world: shewing how both of them are from God, though differently: the spirituall being instituted immediatly by him, and deliuered to the Apo

                  ēporall, the sayd Catholicke Deuine deduceth out of the same the differēt dignity, excellency, & eminency, of the one, & the other power, the one being called Deuine, the other Humane, for that the ends, and obiects of the one are immediatly concerning the soule, as now we haue declared: and the other concerning humane affaires immediatly, though mediatly in a Christian Common wealth referred also to God. And this di
                     •
                  ference of these two powers he declareth by the similitude & likenesse of flesh and spirit out of S. Gregory Nazianzen,

                   who in a certaine narration of his, doth most excellently expresse the same by the comparison of spirit and flesh, soule and sense: which thing (saith he) may be considered as two distinct Common wealthes separated the one from the other, or conioyned togeather in one Common wealth only.
                  
                     Answere to Reports pag. 24. An example of the former wherin they are separated may be in beasts and Angels, the one hauing their common wealth of sense only, without soule or spirit: and the other Cōmon wealth of Angels, being of spirit only without flesh or body; but in man are conioyned both the one, & the other. And euen so (sayth he) in the Common wealth of Gentils was the Ciuill and Poli

                  tian Church for almost three hundred yeares togeather none or few Kings, Princes, or Potentates being conuerted, the Common wealth of Christians was gouerned only or principally by spirituall authority vnder the Apostles and Bishops that succeeded them.
               
                  12. Out of which consideration confirmed, and strengthened by sundry places of holy scripture, & ancient Fathers alleaged by him, he sheweth the great eminency of spirituall Authority aboue temporall, being considered seuerally in themselues, though they may stand ioyntly, and both togeather in a Christian Common wealth, where the temporall Princes be Christiās, though with this necessary subordination, that in spirituall and Ecclesiasticall affaires belonging to the soule, the spirituall gouernours be chiefly to be respected, as in Ciuill affaires the temporall magistrate is to be obeyed, and this he sheweth by diuers examples, and occasions out of S. Ambrose, S. Chrysostome, S. Gregory Nazianzen, and other Bishops and Prelats, that in Ecclesiasticall affayres prefered themselues, and their authorities before that of Christian Emperours, with whome they lyued, expresly affirming, that in those respects they were their Superiours & Pastours, & the said Emperours their sheep & subiects, though in temporall affaires they acknowledged them to be their Superiours.
               13. All this is set downe by the Catholicke Deuine with great variety of proofes, many examples,

If the forsaid three Fathers (to pretermit all others) S. Gregory Nazianzen, S. Chrysostome, and S.

                  rom the purpose, to proue that Queene Elizabeth could not haue it? What will Syr Edward answere here for his Nihil dicit?
               
               14. After all this, and much more alleaged by the Catholicke Deuine, which I pretermit for breuities sake, he commeth to reduce the whole controuersie betweene M. Attorney and him, vnto two generall heads of proofe, the one de Iure, the other de facto, that is of right, and fact, shewing, that in the first of these two proofes de Iure, which is the principall, M. Attorney did not so much as attempt to say any thing 
                     •
                  or proofe,Two sorts of proofes de iure & de facto. that by right, Queene Elizabeth, or any of her Ancestours had supreme iurisdiction in causes Ecclesiasticall, but only that de

                     acto some of them had sometymes taken, and exercised such an authority. Which if it were without right, was as yow know nothing at all: and therfore the sayd Deuine hauing proued more at large, that by no right of any law whatsoeuer, diuine, or humane, Queene Elizabeth, or her predecessours had or could haue supreame authority Spirituall, he cōmeth to ioyne with M. Attorney also in the second, prouing that neyther in fact any such thing was euer pretended or practised by any of her Predecessours, before the tyme of her Father K. Henry the

                  viij either before or after the Conquest.
               15. And as for before the Conquest, there haue beene more then an hundred Kings of different Kingdomes within the land, he proueth by ten large demonstrations,Ten Demonstrations against M. Attorneys assertion de facto before the Conquest. that none of them did euer take vpon him such supreme spirituall authority, but acknowledged it expresly to be in the Bishop of Rome; of which demōstrations, the first is of lawes made by them generally in fauour, and confirmation of the liberties of the English Church, according to the directions and Canons deriued 
                     •
                  rom the authority of the Sea Apostolicke. The second, that Ecclesiasticall lawes in England made before the  Conquest, were made by Bishops, and Prelats, who had their Authority from Rome, and not by temporall  Kinges. The third, that all determination of weighty Ecclesiasticall affayres were referred not only by the Christian people generally of that Realme, as occasions fell out, but by our Kings also in those dayes, vnto Rome, and the Sea Apostolicke. The 
                     •
                  ourth, that the Confirmations of all Priuiledges, Franchises of Churches, Monasteries, Hospitals, and the like were in those dayes demaunded, and obteyned from the Pope. The fifth, that in all  Ecclesiasticall controuersies, suites, and grieuances, there were made Appeales, and complaints to the Sea of Rome for remedy. The sixth, the succession of  Bishops & Archbishops in England during that time all acknowledging the supremacy of the Pope, were notwithstanding in high fauour, and reuerence with the English Kings, with whom they lyued: wherof is in
                     •
                  erred, that these Kings also must needs be of the same iudgment and beliefe, and consequently make lawes conforme to that their fayth and beliefe: as contrariwise since the schisme began by K. Henry the 8. other Princes, being of contrary

beliefe, haue also made the contrary lawes.
               16. These heads of demonstration togeather with foure more not vnlike to these, which for breuity I do pretermit, being laid forth at large by the Deuine with the manifest proofes, and declarations out of the ancient, and irrefragable histories of our Nation to make this euident inference that our Christian Kings before the Conquest did all of thē acknowledge the Popes supreme Iurisdiction in spirituall affayres, and consequently they acknowledged also that it appertayned not to themselues. And wheras the Attorney to proue his assertion alleageth two examples before the Conquest,Two instances of M. Attorney before the Cōquest, helping him nothing. the one of K. Kenulphus about a Priuiledge he gaue to the Abbey of Abingdon, the other of K. Edward the Con
                        •
                     essour, that sayth, That a King as Vicar of the highest, must defend the Church: it is answered by the Deuine, that both of these examples do make against M. Attorney. The first, for that there is expresse mention, that this Priuiledge was giuen by Authority from the Pope: and the second, that it is nothing to the purpose, K Edward speaking of temporall Authority, whē he sayth, That the King is Vicar of the highest, and in the very same place insinuating most manifestly that in spirituall affayres the Pope is supreme, and consequently that both these authorities were frandulently brought in by M. Attorney: yea the former most will
                     •
                  ully corrupted, as I do shew more largely, and particulerly in the end of my twelfth Chapter of my booke of Mi
                        •
                     igation. And was not all this to the purpose? Or will M. Attorney call this a Nihil dicit, whē the cause shall come before him in seat of Iudgment?
               17. Lastly, the Deuine comming downe from the tyme of the Conquest vnto our dayes, to wit, to the raigne of K. Henry the viij. sheweth largely in the seuerall

liues of euery one of those Kings, that in this point of the Popes supreme Ecclesia
                     •
                  ticall Authority they were all vniforme in one & the selfe same beliefe, and acknowledgment: which he proueth out of their owne wordes, factes, lawes, histories, & other authenticall proofes. And if at any time there fell out any disagreement, or disgust betweene any King,Concerning the English Kinges after the Conquest and the Pope that liued in his tyme, it was only vpon particuler interests, complaints of abuses by officers, euill informers or the like: for remedy wherof some restrictions, agreements, or concordates were made, as now they be also in other Catholick Countries: & not for that any English King from the very first Christened, vnto K. Henry the 8. (nor he neyther for the first 20. yeares of his raigne) did euer absolutly deny the Popes supreme Iurisdiction in Ecclesiasticall causes.
               18. And secondly the sayd Deuine answereth fully to all those pieces and parcels of lawes, that M. Attorney produceth, which are shewed either fraudulently to be alledged, or wholly misconstred, or vtterly to be impertinent to the conclusion which they should inferre. And shall this in like manner be iudged from the purpose, and a Nihil dicit? where now is that Iudge that gaue sentence 
                     •
                  or him in this behalfe, will he come forth & stand to his sentence? Or will Syr Edward Cooke be so vnreasonable in this behalf,Syr Edward precipitant in au
                        •
                     rring things against Catholickes. as to request any man to belieue him that such a Iudgment was giuē for him? Or that he foūd so vniust a Iudge as would giue such a sentence so contrary to all conscience, sense, and reason? But yow must note that many men haue noted this to be somewhat singular in Syr Edward Cooke (as many other points be) that when he talketh of Catholicks or their a
                     •
                  fayres, he is so confident, resolute, & precipitant in his asseuerations against them (especially

when he preacheth on the Bench, or giueth his Charge) that except we belieue him at his bare word, contrary to all liklihood of truth, the most part of that he speaketh will seeme to be wilfull vntruthes spoken against his owne conscience: so litle he remembreth the saying of the prophet, Pone ostium circumstantiae labijs meis.
                  
                     Psalm. 140 I do not say they are lyes, for that were inurbanity, considering his present dignity, but that they may seeme such to the wyser sort, for that they lacke this doore of true circumstances to make them probable, wherof we shall haue occasion to touch some more examples afterward. Now we shall passe on to examine whether this Nihil dicit, obiected to his Aduersary, do not fall more iustly vpon himselfe, and therwith also an opposite charge called a Nimium dicit, which is to speake more then is true.
            
            
               THAT THE Imputation of Nihil dicit, doth fall more rightly vpon M. Attorney: as doth also the Nimium dicit, or euerlashing in his assertions. §. II.
               HAVING shewed now that the Nihil dicit cannot be ascribed to the Catholicke Deuine, for that he left written so much and so effectuall to the purpose he had in hand, it would be an easie m

                  tter to shew in regard of the contrary effectes that the sa

                  e remaineth with M. Attorney: both for that he answered litle or nothing, and that wholy from the purpose. The 
                     •
                  irst is manifest by this new Preface of his, wherin he answereth scarce halfe a

page to more then 400. pages of my booke written against him. The second also is not obscure by that I haue written in the precedent Paragraph of the impertinencie of proofs produced against vs, which afterward perhaps may be better examined, and consequently for both these respects, the Nihil dicit lighteth vpon himselfe.

                  uthes of all his other writings against vs.
               21. To begin then with that which before we touched, he auoucheth in this his Preamble;A manifest vntruth vttered by Syr Edw.

                      any of his opinions or conceipts: wherupon (as in Iustice, sayth he, I ought) I had iudgment giuen for me vpon a Nihil dicit. Thus farre the Knight: wherby you perceaue, that the immediate cause of this iudgment giuen in his fauour was grounded vpon this presumption, that the Deuine neyther quoted nor cyted any one such witnesse throughout all his booke: which if it be euidently false (as now I shall proue it) then must the Iudge confesse, if he will not be Iudex iniquus, that the sentence of Nihil dicit is to be reuoked as vniust.
               22. Let vs see then how true or false this assertion is, or rather how many seuerall falshoods there are conteyned in one. First then page 163. The Deuin

And pag. 271. he citeth two lawes anno 1. Edward. 3. stat. 2. cap. 2. & 14. eiusdem statut. 3. pro Clero,
                  Variety of legall authorities out of law books and doth argue out of them for profe of his principall purpose against Syr Edward. And how then, or with what face doth, or can the Knight auouch heere that the said Deuine alleageth no one Act or law of Parlament or other iudiciall record throughout his whole booke? doth he remēber his owne saying in this his Preface: That euery man that writeth ought to be so carefull of setting downe truth, as if the credit of his whole worke cōsisted vpō the certainty of euery particuler period? Doth he obserue this? How many periods be there heere false of his? But let vs see further. Pag. 277. in the life of king Edward the first the said Deuine doth cite an expre

Edwardi 3. cap. 5. and all these things are cited by the Deuine before he commeth to treat peculierly of the lyfe of King Edward the third:Manifest and wilfull vntruthes vttered by Syr Edward. but vnder him, & after him he doth not alleage as few as 20. legall authorities, and statutes of Acts of Parlaments: so as for M. Attorney to auouch here so boldly & peremptorily as he doth, that the Deuine in all his booke did not alleage so much as any one authority eyther out of the cōmon lawes or Acts of Parlament, or other legall or iudiciall record, is a strange boldene
                     •
                  se indeed: And yet he sayth, that he found the Author vtterly ignorant and exceeding bold. But if he could conuince him of such boldnes, as I haue now conuinced himselfe, for affirming a thing so manifestly false, I should thinke him bold indeed, or rather shameles: for that heere are as many vntruthes, as there are negatiue assertions, which is a Nimium dicit, with store of witnesses.
               23. It is another Nimium dicit also, yf yow consider it well, that which he writeth in the same place, that, when he looked into the booke, euer expecting some answere to the matter, he found none at all. Wheras he found all that is touched in the former Paragraph and much more, which was so much in effect, as he saw not what reply he could make therunto: which himselfe confesseth a litle before in these wordes, saying: Expect not from me, good Reader, any reply at all: for I will not answer vnto his Inuectiues, and I cannot make any reply at all vnto any part of his discourse: & yet doth he endeauour to mitigate this also, saying: That the Deuine answereth nothing out of the lawes of the Realme, the only subiect (sayth he) of the matter in hand. And a litle af

Peter: which great matter is not to be tryed only (as in reason yow will see) by the Municipall lawes of England, or by some few particuler cases deduced from them, but by the whole latitude of diuine and humane proofes, as Scriptures, Fathers, Doctors, histories, practises of the primitiue Church, lawes both Canon and Ciuill, and the like, as the Deuine doth teach in differēt occasions of his booke, adding further: That albeit it should be graunted to Syr Edward that this matter should be discussed by the common Municipall, and Statute lawes of England only, yet would he remayne wholy vanquished, as largely doth appeare by the deduction of the said Deuine throughout all the succession of English Kings from Ethelbert the first Christened, to King Henry the 8. that first fell into schisme against the Church of Rome. This then was a notorious Nimium dicit.

Another is when he sayth in reproofe of the Deuines answer to his Reports, that the booke is exceeding all bounds of truth and charity, full of maledictions and calumniations, nothing pertinent to the state of the question: and that it becommeth not Deuines to be of a fiery and Salamandrine spirit, soming out of a hoat mouth &c. which indeed will seeme to any indifferent man a stange passionate exaggeration of Syr Edward,
                  The temperate proceeding of the Deuine in his wrytings. exceeding all tearmes of simple truth, for that there is nothing found in that booke, but temperatly spoken, and with respect as it

seemeth both to his Office and Person: but yet when he saw the exobitant intemperance of the Attorneyes hatred against Catholicks to draw him to such acerbity of bloudy calumniations, that he would needes inuolue them all in the heynons cryme of treason by meere sycophancy, & malicious collections vpō false supposed groundes, and fictions of Pius quintus his Bull, and such like impertinent imputations; no meruaile though he were more earnest in the repulsion of such open wronges; but yet with that moderation, as I perswade my selfe no iniurious, or contumelious speach can be alleaged to haue passed from him in all that booke, & much lesse such inu

                  ctiues as heere M. Attorney chargeth him withall: as also with that fierie Salamandrine spirit, foming out of a hoat mouth, wherein, besydes the contumely, which he will easily pardon, Syr Edward speaketh more then I suppose his skill in Philosophie, or history will be able to auerre or beare him out. For that ancient Pliny in his naturall history treating of the nature of the Salamander which lyueth in fyre, sayth not that he is hoat & fiery,
                     Plinius lib. 10. histor. natural. cap. 67. but contrary wise so extreme cold of nature, as he resisteth the very force of the fire if selfe. So as whiles M. Attorney goeth about to accuse his aduersary of too much heate, his example inferreth that he is ouer could, & that he mistooke quid pro quo. And was not this a Nimium dicit in like manner?
               25. Another excesse though of meaner marke including also a Nimiū dicit, is cōmouly noted in Syr Edward,

               26. But I am departed vnawares from the examples of his present Preface, and therefore shall returne thither againe. When he saw himselfe ouerloaden with the multitude and variety of testimonies for prouing the principall question of the Popes supreme authority spirituall, he answered thus:Impertinent Grā

                     aciendum populum, to hunt after popular applause? How impertmently is this Grammaticall phrase applyed by Syr Edward?
               27. But let vs see the next. In reading these and other of my Reportes (sayth he) I desire the Reader, that he would not reade (and as it were swallow) too much at once: for greedy appetites are not of the best digestion: the whole is to be attayned by partes, and nature (which is the best guyde) maketh no leape: Natura non facit saltum. In which words as I acknowlege the aduertisment to be good, that a man ought not to reade too much togeather, least he confound his memory: So why this phrase of Natura non facit saltum is brought in, but only for the forsaid Grammaticall oftentatiō I see not. Nature maketh no leape, but she procedeth orderly, digesting one thing after an other, it is true: but what is this to proue that a man may not reade to much at one tyme? Surely this leape of M. Attorney was somewhat wyde from the purpose: and if his wrytings in law-matters be no more gracious and attractiue, then are his discourses in Deuinity, and Controuersies, I presume the Reader, that esteemeth his tyme worth the bestowing, will not haue need of this aduertisment, that he read not ouer much at once in his Reportes, for that wearines will soone bring him to that moderation.
               28. And thus much haue I thought good to say briefly to such points of this Pre

But by his leaue Syr Edward must haue patiēce to let me tell him, that his Answers are so far of from being demonstratiue, that is to say, euident, certaine and irrepugnable, as that they are not so much as Logicall, that is to say, probable; nor haue any true forme or force of a lawfull argument in them: for that they go about to proue vniuersalls by particulers, and yet do not so much in effect as proue those seely particulers which they pretend. These two points then are to be examined, first about the supposed antiquity & excellēcy of his Municipall lawes: and secondly his proofe and confirmation therof by his Answers to the Students foure questiōs deuised by himselfe.

As first in that yt is auerred, that the Ciuill law and Roman lawes are not of so long continuance of ancient tymes, as the anciēt Municipall Lawes of England are, which he goeth about to proue by two seuerall meanes, wherof both do conteine aswell falsyties as absurdities, if I be not greatly deceiued therin.

Common Lawes of our Realme at this day: Wherin there are many suppositions, as yow see, strange to heare, but harder in my opinion to be proued. As first, that the Britans in their beginning euen before Rome was buylt, had such good Lawes as the Romans in Englād seauen hūdred years after the said building of Rome, were cōtent to accept for their Lawes in that land. And the lyke after them the Saxons, & other Cō
                  querous people that ensued: which is such a paradox vnto men of reason & learning, as the very naming therof cannot but cause laughter. For albeit the British nation be more ancient then the Roman, according to the Story of Geffrey Monmouth,
                  
                     Galfridus Monumetensis lib. 1. historiae.
                   that affirmeth thē to discend from Brutus a Nephew of Aeneas, from whom Romulus the founder of Rome some ages after descended: and that they were a valiant warlike nation from the beginning: yet that they had such good politicke and ciuill Lawes (themselues being vnciuill in those dayes) is a matter incredible, which I proue thus: That wheras the Roman Lawes began from Romulus himselfe & from Numa Pompilius & other ancient Law-makers among them, and this soone after the building of Rome (I meane the more older Lawes of the twelue Tables,) and the lyke continued from tyme to tyme afterwards, vntill the cōming of Iulius Caesar into Britany, which was aboue 600. yeares after Rome was built, & aboue a thousand after Brutus had byn in England: in which tyme yt is probable, that the British Lawes, would haue growne to greater perfectiō thē they were in the beginning: yet I say that the said Lawes & customes of the Britans are recorded to be such in Iulius Caesar his daies, & set downe by his owne penne, as also by the writings of diuers other Roman & Greeke Authors that succeded for two or three hundred years after him, as must needs be incredible that they should

be continued by the Romans, Saxons, and other people that followed them. And then if they were such, and so rude so many ages after their beginning, what may we imagine they were at their very begynning it selfe, which was a thousand yeares before, from which tyme our two Knights heere do inferre their antiquity and eminency aboue the Roman Lawes?

From the purpose, for that Syr Edward exprely heere pretēdeth to speake only of humane Lawes:An impertinent exception. so as whether the people whose Lawes they are, do worship God or not, is from the question. Besides that M. Cooke I thinke will not deny, but that the Romans worshipped God, and were Christians, at least many of them, before the Britans (if this made any thing to the purpose:) and yet will he haue the Britans Lawes to be more ancient then those of the Romans: so as this circumstance of worshipping God is neyther true, or to the purpose.
               40. Secondly it is vntrue, that the British Lawes were before the Lawes of any Nation that worshipped God, for that the Iewes worshipped God, and may be presumed also to haue had some politicall Lawes for their Ciuill gouerment among themselues, long before the Britans; yea before Moyses gaue them his written Lawes For that being a Nation so popul

                  That if the ancient lawes of this noble Island had not excelled all the others, speaking of humane, it could not be but some of the seuerall Conquerours and Gouernours therof, that is to say, the Romans, Saxons, Danes or Normans, and especially the Romans, would haue altered or changed the same. Where yow see, he holdeth it for a supposed knowne, & receiued principle, that none of all these Conquerous people, entring into Britany, did alter or chāge the old British lawes: and consequently that those which now we call the Cō
                  mon lawes of England, were also the lawes of the ancient Brytans, and theirs ours: which is one of the most solemne absurdities in my opinion, that euer proceded from the mouth of a man, pretending to be learned in his owne Countrey affayres.

                  t besides the demonstration before made to the contrary, out of reason and euident probability, that the Britans generally hauing receiued very litle vse of Ciuill policy vntill two hundred yeares after Christ vnder the Emperour Alexander Scuerus,
                  Whether the anciēt British Lawes were euer changed or altered. and almost three hundred after they had byn vnder the Romans, it was not likely that the sayd Romans, their Conquerours, would admit their lawes & customes so much condemned by them of barbarism
                     •
                   and inciuility, as by the former related Authors both Greeke and Latin hath byn declared. Besides this (I say) there is expresse mention found in antiquity,

though M. Attorney seemeth not to know it, of the change of those Lawes and customes by the Roman Emperours.
               
                  
                     Plin. lib. 30 hist. cap. 1.43. For first Pliny that lyued presently after the Apostles, recounteth that the Emperour Tiberius Caesar, vnder whome our Sauiour suffered, did take away diuers of their Lawes and customes, especially about sacrificing of men, women and Children, in lu

                     •
                  hereupon the sayd Pliny maketh this consideration: Non satis aestimari potest, quantum Romanis debeatur, qui sustulere Monstra, in quibus hominem occidere religiosissimum erat, mandi v

                     rò etiam saluberrimum. It cannot be sufficiently esteemed how much the Britans do owe to the Romans that tooke away these monstrous customes and lawes, wherby it was held a most religious thing, to kill men: and a most wholesome to eate them. Wherby appeareth that diuers lawes of the Britans were changed by the Romans, and namely those of their Pagan sacrifices (which were their principall) albeit the Romans were yet heathens and Pagans themselues: so as this ouerthroweth quite Syr Edwards false principle, that British lawes were neuer changed nor altered by the Romans.

And after the Conquest of King VVilliam that was the Conquerour, who like a Conquerour indeed tooke that liberty to himselfe, as to change and alter at his pleasure all lawes of what nation or people soeuer he found in vse before him in our Iland, which Polidore testifyeth out of ancient authorities in these words: Leges penè omnes à superioribus sanctiss.

He tooke away almost all the lawes, that had byn made before the Conquest by most holy Kings for their happie life and gouerment of the people, and gaue new lawes more vnequall, which they that ensued retayned to their owne losse: as though it had byn a great cryme to break those lawes, which a Conquerour that was no friend of the English natiō brought in, insteed of good lawes.

VVherupon yow should haue seene euen from the very beginning therof,
                  The iniquity of the Conquerours lawes that now are English. 
                  partly by the iniquity or iniustice of the Lawes themselues, and partly by the ignorance or vnskil

And by this may appeare how true it is, that Syr Edward doth affirme, that neyther Romans, Saxons, Danes, or Normans euer altered or changed the ancient British lawes of our Iland, but that they be now the selfe same that they were then: And of all other Nations the best: An assertion worthy of such an Antiquary, as Syr Edward would be thought to be.
               51. And albeit this may be sufficient and superaboundāt also for ouerthrow of Syr Edwards imagination, that our common lawes were neuer changed, but continued still for their excellency in goodnes in all tymes, euen from Iulius Caesars dayes downeward, for that he fyndeth, or at leastwise surmiseth some things or customes lyke the one to the other in different tymes, and vnder different Princes, as now you haue heard: yet will I adioyne one consideration more to the contrarie of his, concerning particuler lawes, which are found to haue bene both vnder the Saxons, Danes, and old English, that are not now in vse,

                   (which is easely to be knowne or coniectured) great perill hangeth ouer their heads to be troubled, vexed, and forced to weare papers for periury. This I say considered by learned men, that are indifferent in the cause, doth make them wonder and thinke, that no Natiō liuing hath more harder lawes in this point, nor more vnequall for the subiect, then ours.
               
                   56. The like may be sayd about the dowry of women that do marry,Dowry of marriage. which if it be in money, goods, or Chattels, may be spent and consumed by the euill husband; against whome she hath no remedy, nor security at all, which by the Roman Ciuill lawes is most carefully prouided for. So as whatsoeuer disorders the euill husband doth commit, eyther in spēding, or offending: yet is his wiues dowry secure, nor can he spend or dilapidate any thing therof, but only the rent, or annuall Income for what occasions soeuer.
               
                   57. Another also not vnlike to this is the small prouision by our common lawes for yonger brothers especially of the Gentrie and Nobility,Prouision for yonger Brothers. who being brought vp, during their Fathers life in equall condition with the elder brother, are afterward inforced to great inequality; yea oftentymes to great misery, our common lawes not prouiding for them in

the diuident of their Fathers goods, nor yet obliging their said elder brother to allow them competent maintenance, conforme to their state and birth, which other Countreys do.
               58. The Case also of Pupils seemeth strange to forraine nations,Pupills & Pupilage. that the wardship of them both for  education and liuings, I meane of such as haue any tenure from the King in Capite should be in the Princes hand, without any obligation of yealding accompt for the Rents receaued, spent, or wasted. Nay that their marriage, and marriage-money, or wyues dowry must appertaine to the Prince, and be in his disposition: wheras in all other Kingdoms abroad there is singular care had, and prouision made by their lawes for Pupills, and Pupillage: and so doth their case in all equity require, as being orphanes, and destitute of their Father, that should protect them. I might touch heere diuers other markable points, which foreiners do consider, and one not the least, that our law doth not seeme to haue sufficiently prouided for the exorbitant liberty and auarice of some of our lawyers (for all are not culpable) in taking money without lymit, and enriching  themselues therby more swiftly and excessiuely then any other sort of men whatsoeuer,Liberty & auarice of some Lawyers. which being ioyned with their authority, & power to oppresse whom they will, they become a terrour (euery one in his Coūtrey) to the best of the Kings subiects: so as no man dare to speake or looke against them. And truly the particulers that are recounted of exorbitant Fees taken by diuers, to purchase, as it were, their looke, without saying any one word for thē at the barre are strāg, & yet not so much to be wōdred at, as lamented: for that there is no hope of redresse. And whether Syr Edward himselfe haue beene one of these lawyers, and had his share among them proportionable

That wheras in that speach to make his auditours merry, he brought in an example framed by himselfe, as may be supposed, of a Prior or Monke that craftily induced a Gentleman to giue part of his lands from his sonne and heire to a Monastery; for which act his sayd sonne comming into his sicke Fathers chamber whiles the matter was in doing, did by his Fathers leaue beat the monke out of the Chāber with good

               60. I haue recyted I thinke in some other place & occasion, a true story, that fell out not many yeares agone in the Indies, where a great rich man being very sicke, and hauing had great trafficke of affayres in his life,A true serious story answering to Syr Edwards tale sent for a Deuine to direct his conscience at his last vpshot, who examining his estate found him obnoxious to great restitutions, as of some hundreth thousand crownes, perhaps, which he had gayned vniustly, and bestowed in rents and lyuings for his sonne and heire. Wherfore the learned man telling him that eyther he must make restitution, or be damned, quia non dimittitur peccatum, nisi restituatur ablatum, he answered him, that it was vnpossible: for that his sonne and whole house would be vtterly decayed therby. Wherūto the other answered that thē it was vnpossible for him to be saued, & that heerof he did assure him vpon his conscience and skill in Deuinity that there was no other remedy to be taken, or help to be had in that case, for that no absolution can saue betweene the Priest, and his Penitent, where is included the interest or hurt of a third. Wherat the sicke Father being somwhat astonished
                     •
                   and terrified desired him to deale with his sonne: but his sonne would not so much as heare any mention therof, but rather was as ready to haue beaten out the sayd Deuine, as Syr Edwards yong Gentleman was to beate out the Monke. Wherupon the Deuine tooke this resolution to bring him before his Father, and told him that vpon his conscience and soule his Father was to go to eternall flames of hell, if due restitutiō were not made: but yet that he had thought vpon a certaine meane, how some satisfaction might be made, wherby God perhaps might be moued to pardon

his Father so great extremity of punishment:The Fathers prudent and pious resolution. which was that his said sonne should hold his finger but one halfe quarter of an houre in the fire, or ouer a Candle, therby to deliuer his Father from eternall fyre. But he answered, that he would not do it for ten tymes so much land as his Father was to leaue him. Wherupon the Deuine inferred, saying: And will yow haue your Father to lye body and soule in eternall fire for these landes, and yet will not your selfe suffer halfe a quarter of an houres burning of your finger, for ten tymes as much? Wherupō his Father resolued absolutly to make restitutiō though with no smal abatement of his sonnes estate.
               61. And now of this example I shall not need to make any application, for it is cleere inough of it selfe. I do not wish

But this seemeth but a matter of iest to Syr Edward, and so we shall leaue to treate any further therof, and passe to peruse the second part of his present Preface, wherin he pretendeth by foure cases, or questions propounded by the student, and answered by himselfe, to confirme, and establish his precedent assertion of the supereminent antiquity, and excellency of our English Municipall lawes aboue all others; but especially their antiquity;

which he doth performe in as strange a māner, as euer commonly I haue heard man dispute.
            
            
               ABOVT FOVRE seuerall questions said to be propounded by the Student in law, and solued by the Iudge for confirmation of the Antiquity, and Eminency of our moderne English Lawes. §. IIII.
               SYR Edward hauing set downe before the demaund of his student about the supereminent antiquity of the English Lawes maketh him to say thus: That some of another profession are not perswaded, that the common lawes of England are of so great antiquity as there (in my Preface) superlatiuely is spoken. In which words no doubt but he meaneth the Catholicke Deuine, and then as glad to see some doubt or cōtradiction made therof for him to shew his skill, and readines in answering, he writeth thus:
                     Preface to the 6. part of Reports.
                   
                  I was right glad to heare of any exception (sayth he) to the end that such as were not perswaded might eyther be rightly instructed, and the truth confirmed, or that I might vpon true grounds be conuerted. Do yow see how confidently he writeth? And do yow thinke, that he will be a true Conuertite in deed? If he meaneth sincerly, we haue alleaged him now many and sufficient groundes, which either he must acknowledg, or take vpon him to answere them. Let vs heare how he goeth forward.
               63. I desired (quoth he) to know some particulers,
                  
                     Ibidem. 
                     
                        •
                     ower questions proposed & solued. 
                  as many as they would, at length their great desyre was to see some proofs, that the common law in these 4. cases, was before the Conquest, as now it is. First, that the Queene, being wise to a King regnant

was a person sole by the common law to sue and be sued, to  giue, and take &c. solely without the King. Secondly, that  a man seised of lands in see simple shall 
                        •
                     orseit his landes and goodes by Attainder of

                     ellony by out-lawry, and therby his heirs  should be desinherited. Thirdly, that a woman being attaynted o
                        •
                      petite treason (for killing her husband) should be  burnt. Fourthly, whether the ancient lawes of England did permit any appeale to Rome in causes spirituall or Ecclesiasticall.
               
               64. Thus farre the questions framed by Syr Edward insteed of his student, for that he persuaded himselfe to haue somewhat to say for their proofe, though in deed it be nothing, as presently yow will see: for that no student of any capacity would haue proposed these particuler cases to proue a generall assertion that the lawes of England, were the most ancient of all other lawes. For though we suppose all these 4. points were true, and to be proued, as he setteth them downe, that they were in vse before the Conquest: yet do they not inferre, that the moderne English lawes are the same without change or alteration that were of the Britans, Saxons, and Danes. For that diuers particuler cases may be common to different lawes, as there were in the lawes of the Lacedimoniās, Carthaginians, Athenians, Romans: and yet we may not for that cause conclude, that they were the selfe same lawes deliuered from the one people to the other, without alteration; which is heere the badde inference of Syr Edward. But now let vs see whether these particulers can be proued, as heere they are promised, and first let vs heare him vaunt yet once againe.
               65. I had no sooner (sayth he) seene these questions, but instantly I found direct and demonstratiue answers to the same. Behold the fertility, and felicity of his wit, that fyndeth instantly so direct, and demonstratiue proofes: that is to say,

such as are euident, cleere, vniuersall, and irrefragable (for such only may be called demonstratiue according to the rules of Logicke:

               66. Thus farre this Charter, but now I would demaund what Syr Edward meaneth to proue heerby? He pretendeth to proue that the common law was the same before the Conquest, as it is now, about the priui
                     •
                  edge of Queenes to be able to buy and sell, giue and take of thēselues solely without licence of their husbandes. But first if he could shew this, or somewhat like to this out of some particuler fact of some particuler English Queene before the Conquest: yet what were this to proue eyther the antiquity of the common law before the Danes, Saxons, and Romans, as

heere he promiseth? or that this particuler fact of Qu. Ethelswith was a law, or according to the cōmon law in those dayes? doth one particuler instance or action make a law, or proue a law with Syr Edward? Might not Queene Ethelswith make that sale and gift which heere she doth to her seruant, out of her own dowry, portion, or inheritance, which she brought with her from her Father, and brother Kings of the VVest Saxons? And if she did, the case proueth nothing. For so may not only married Queens, but all other wiues also giue of their owne.
               67. And supposing she had receaued that land in gift from the King her husband, and had had his leaue, and consent also to alienate, sell, or giue the same, it had byn no proofe of a common law but a particuler fact by licence of her husband, as euery one will confesse. Now then, that not only one but both these conditions were in this fact of Queene Ethelswith (to wit, that she disposed of her owne, & this also with the speciall consent of her husband) appeareth clearly by the very wordes of the Charter it selfe, where first it is sayd: Donabo aliquam telluris partem meae propriae potestatis, I will giue a certaine part of land, which is of my owne proper power: that is to say of my owne right and possession. And secondly, both her brother King Ethelred of the VVest Saxons (in whose dominions it may be that the sayd p

And was this a good exāple to proue that it was a law at that tyme, that euery Queene might take, & giue solely without the King her husband? did Syr Edward when he was Attorney make such good consequences, and frame such demonstratiue arguments in his pleadings at the barre

Which was but 71. yeares before the Conquest (though Syr Edward sayd it was long:) and the donation was of a certaine piece of land, that was forfeyted to the King by one Ethelsig, that hauing committed theft, and flying to the woods was out-lawed therupon: whereby the King came to haue his goods and lands & made donation therof to another, to wit Vls

                     icke, And this is all the proofe, direct or indirect which Syr Edward alleageth. But heere againe I would aske him, how doth this prooue the principall question, of the great antiquity of the moderne English Common lawes before the Danes, Saxons, and Romans, seeing the case fell out so neare before the Conquest. Secōdly 
                     •
                   would demand of him, how he can prooue that it is proper alone to our English Common lawes to punish theft, murther, out-lawry, and other such crimes, by losse of lāds & goods: for that I do see it practized commonly in all other countreis besides, except only in the Kingdome of Naples: where by peculiar graunt and Concession of the Kings of Spayne, since it came to their dominion, the goods and lands of such delinquents are reserued to their children, except only in crymes of high treason. But in other Kingdomes to my knowledge there is no such reseruation. And I haue vnderstood, that diuers Great men haue forfeyted their lands from their heyres, not only for being outlawes themselues, vpon murthers and such other fellonies, but also 
                     •
                  or fauouring & ayding such men: wherof I could giue diuers examples fresh yet

in memorie, but that it is not expedient for vs to medle in matters of other Common wealthes: so as this is no proper law of England, as heere it seemeth to be presumed by Syr Edward, but cōmon to all or most Nations: and therefore no maruayle though it were in vse also among the English before the Conquest.
               70. His third case proposed is this,Answer to the third question. 
                  that a wise being attaynted of petty treason, for killing her husband, should be burnt, as now is vsed in England: & to proue that this is an anciēt law of the Brittans, & frō them come down to our tyme without change or alteration, he citeth a place out of Caesar in his Commentaries lib. 6. affirming, that i

                      the death of her husband, & si compertum est, igne &c. interficiunt: that is (saith he) if she be sound guilty of the death of her husband (which is petty treason) she is burnt to death, as she is in that case at t

                  s, as here is related: yet what doth this make to the maine questiō to prooue, that the English municipall lawes are the same now that they were vnder the Brittans in Caesars tyme without alteration?About burning of women for petty treason in Cesars time.
                   Is one example of similitude sufficient to proue this? May not the different lawes of diuers countries agree in some one case or other, without this inference, that therefore they are the same lawes? Was not hanging for theft in vse also among the Brittans, Romans, and Grecians? and yet were not the lawes one and the selfe same. And supposing that the Brittans had had this punishmēt of wiues for killing their husbands in Cesars tyme, how will Syr

                     dward proue, that this endured allwayes afterward, & was neuer changed by the Romans, Saxons, Danes, or Normans? why had he not alleaged some examples of the continued vse and practise of the same

throughout the raignes of the subsequent Kings, and Nations? Was his store house so barren, that he had but one only example to bring forth, and that so farre fecht as from Cesar by a leap to our time? heere Natura

               71. But now I must shew that nothing is heere sincerely related, but all corrupted & peruerted. For first Caesar in the place of his Cōmentaries heere alleaged, doth not talke of Britans, but expressely of Frenchmen, when he setteth downe their lawes and customes cōcerning the power and vse they haue in punishing their wiues, beginning his narration thus: Galli se omnes (sayth Caesar) ab Dite patre prognatos praedicant,

                  The custome of Frenchmen about authority ouer their wyues in Iulius Caesars tyme.
                   Men (in France) haue power of life and death vpon their wiues, as also vpon their children: and when the head of any honourable family dieth, all his kinred do gather themselues togeather to make inquiry of his death, if there be any suspicion that he was made away, then they do vse torments vpon the wiues, as if they were slaues: and if it be found that they were guilty of the sayd death, then after they haue bene tormented by fire and all other torments, they put them to death.
               72. In which narration first you see no mention of Britans, but only of Frenchmen, as hath bene noted: the nobility wherof are deuided by Caesar into two

sortes; the one Druides, that had care of their sacrifices, and matters of Religion, the other Equites, Knights that made as it were the lay nobility, and of whome he recounteth this that we haue here related. You will aske then perchance with what truth or syncerity Syr Edward can recite this as the Law of the Britans which is related by Caesar as the Law of the Frenchmen? He hath no other shift for excuse of this, but to make this note in his margent: See in the Preface to the third part of my Reportes out of Caesars Comment. Disciplina Druidum in Britannia reperta, at
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      inde in Galliam translata esse existimatur. It is t
                        •
                     ought that the discipline o
                        •
                      the Druides was first found in Britanny, and 
                        •
                     rom thence translated into France. And is not this a good reason, that whatsoeuer is recounted by Caesar of Frenchmen should be ascribed to Brittans, 
                  
                     •
                  or that in tymes past the discipline of the Druides is thought by some to haue come from Britanny? What coherence hath this togeather? May not all lawes of the Frenchmen be ascribed by this meanes vnto the Brittans? Is not this a strange direct and demonstratiue proofe, to proue one thing by another? This indeed is an argumēt à disparatis as Logitians do call it. But let vs see more tricks besids this.
               73. Why had not he alleaged the whole place out of Caesar as I haue done? and why doth he cyte the words so cuttedly, & si compertum est, igne &c. interficiunt: & yet in the English leaueth out (&c.) saying And if she be found guilty of the death of her husband (which is petty treason) the wife is burnt to death, as she is in that case at this day. Why had not he set downe (&c.) also in the English, therby to let his Reader vnderstand, that there were some words left out, to wit, at
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      omnibus tormentis excruciatas, interficiunt: they do kill such wiues as are found culpable after they haue byn tormented with fyre and all other torments. What needed the word (&c.) for excluding so few syllables

but that yt stood not well with Syr Edwards purpose to haue them seene & read, for that they shew plainly, that neyther Brittans nor Frenchmen had any such Law or custome to put such wiues to death by burning, though they vsed the same for a torment, before their death.Wilfull fraud by embezeling of words. No more then it may be truly sayd, that Englishmen at this day haue a law or Custome, to put Priests or other men to death by the Racke, though diuers of them haue byn racked, and aft
                     •
                  rward put to death. And this could not my Lord but see in reading Caesar: wherby is euident that his Lordship also commeth into the Classes of them that auouch wilfull and formall vntruthes against their owne conscience and knowledge, when they make for their purpose: and yet is this far from the office & manner of proceeding of a Iudge, that ought to be exact and punctuall in his truth.
               74. But now further to his inference, suppose that he had related his Author truly, and that Caesar had sayd as he sayth: That the ancient Brittans had this law and custome to burne wiues that should be 
                        •
                     ound guilty of their husbands deathes, which Syr Edward saith hath continued to our tyme: why if it were so (to answere coniecture with coniecture) should not the other part of the same law haue remayned also, that husbands should haue power of life and death ouer their wiues, as the Brittans according to Syr Edward had: or how, where, or when can he proue, that, that part of the Law was abrog
                     •
                  ted, and the other of burning them left to remaine? or if he cannot, or that he will say that the other part in like manner doth in rigour remaine,Why one part of the Brittish law descē
                     ded to our tymes and not the other. then would it go hard no dout with many wiues at this day, that are scarse patient of farre lesse power and dominion in their husbands ouer them, then is that of life and death: which Case, as it apperteineth not to me to discusse, nor to Syr Edward, I thinke, to determine, so is

it sufficient for our purpose to haue demonstrated, that his answere to this third question hath neither byn Direct nor Demonstratiue, nor sincerly handled, nor grounded vpon true relatiō. Now then to the fourth and last.

For that the question was, whether this Common law of England, that is now in vse, was in vse also before the Conquest, and that as now it is vsed, which the iudge affirmeth, and for proofe therof alleageth a Statute made an hundred yeares after the Conquest. What will yow say to this? Why had he not alleaged some one example or proofe before the Conquest as the Case and question required? Or why had he not gone about to satisfy some of those examples to the contrary, alleaged by me in the 6. Chapter of my former Answere to his Reportes and fi

                     Answere to Reports Chap. 6 demonst. 5. pag. 1, 3. to wit, of Appeales to Rome of the two Archbishops of Canterbury, Lambert, and Athelard, vnder the two Mercian Kinges Offa and Kenulphus: as also the two other famous Appeales of S. VVilfrid
                  
Archbishop of Yorke against the two Kinges successiuely of the Northumbers, Egfrid & Alfrid? All which are recounted by S. Bede & others long before the Conquest, which in my sayd Booke are set downe, and Syr Edward could not but haue read them, and are full to the purpose to proue the lawfulnes of Appeales in our primitiue Church of Englād: yet now he saith no one word of thē, but cōmeth in with an impertinent instance, that there was a prohibition of Appeales made vnder King Henry the second by Act of Parliament in the tenth yeare of his Raigne, whereas yet there was no Parliament in vse, nor Statute law was begone, vntill the 9. yeare of King Henry the third, which was aboue 60. yeares after, as appeareth both by the Collection of Iustice Rastall, and other Law-bookes.
               76. I do not deny but that King Henry the second entring into passion against S. Thomas Archb. of Canterbury made a decree at a certayne meeting of the Nobility at Claringdon,

                   rather moderating, as himselfe pretended, then taking away Appeales to Rome, not denying that they ought to be made in respect of the Popes supreme authority Ecclesiasticall: but for restrayning of abuses in appealing thither without iust cause or necessity, especially in temporall affaires, he ordeyned that matters should first orderly be handled in England, in the Bishops and Archbishops Courtes: and if that way they could not be ended,

He swore also that he would neither let Appellatiōs nor suffer them to be letted, but that they might be made in his kingdom to the Bishop of Rome in causes Ecclesiasticall &c.
               77. All which things could not but be knowne to Syr Edward before he wrote this his Preface: and that the Catholicke Deuine in his āswer to the fifth part of his Reports, had produced so many euident arguments and probations, that King Henry the 2.K. Henry the secōd very Catholicke in the point of the Pope
                        •
                      supremacy. was most Catholick in this point in acknowledging the Popes supreme Ecclesiasticall authority (notwithstanding the cōtention he had with S. Thomas, about the manner of proceding therin for the execution) as none of his Ancestours were more: which in like manner is euidently seene and confessed in effect by Syr Edward himself, in that in his whole discourse of Reportes, for improuing the said Popes Supremacy he alleageth not so much as one example or instāce out of the raigne of this King: which in reasō he would not haue pretermitted, if he could haue found any thing to the purpose therin.
               78. But yet now finding himselfe in straytes how to answere the Students demand about the ātiquitie of prohibiting Appeales to the Sea of Rome, he was forced to lay hands on this poore example, which was neither to his purpose, in regard of the time, being after the conquest, as now you haue heard; nor of the thing it selfe, for that it was against him, as being only a moderation of abuses, yea and that in temporall things as Bishop Gilbert of London expresly a

                  oucheth, & recalled by the same King afterward

Part of Syr Edwards Reportes, for so much as so many periods haue beene now found false in this very Preface. And secondly it cannot but import the like discredit vnto his said fifth part, for which he framed his former protestation, for that vpon better view of the bookes, Statutes & lawes by him cyted, it is found, that he doth not only misalledge many both wordes and texts, resolutions, and iudgments, but peruerteth many other by wrong inferences, arguments, detorsions, and amplifications of his owne, quite contrary to his former protestation, which now breifly shall be declared more in particuler.

Peter of Yorke, and vnto two Prebends of the same, by a Charter of King VVilliam the

Conquerour, and afterward by another of K. Ed. 1. The chiefe Iustice at that tyme named Herle did foure or fiue tymes at least, during the discussion of that case,Herle chiefe Iustice. giue his iudgement, that by law the Conquerour, nor K.

                     querour. All which the Attorney craftily concealed in his narration of the case, to the end that it might be deemed that the iudgemēt of the Court had beene in K. Edward the thirds tyme (vnder whome this case was handled) that the Conquerour might according to the cōmon-law, make an appropriation by his letters patent. And is this good dealing euen in the very first case which he proposeth a

to Princes, and other founders to prescribe spirituall priuiledges for diuers pious workes erected by them:

                     . which the Popes themselues would afterward confirme, and ratify: so as this also was a fraud in M. Attorney to alleage so impertinent an example; but it sheweth his pouerty and barennesse in examples of those yeares, which being aboue 150. vnder 7. kings, as hath beene said, he could fynd but these two poore examples (nothing prouing the purpose) to bring forth in all this tyme, wheras if he would looke ouer the tyme since K. Henry the 8. tooke vpon him indeed Ecclesiasticall authority by vertue of his temporall Crowne, and the other three Princes who in that haue followed him,Straining & squeesing of ancient Princes actiōs, for some shew of supremacy Ecclesiasticall. whole volumes might be written of examples and presidents giuen therin of practising spirituall power: wherby it is euident: that those former Princes from the Cōquest downward, were not of the opinion and iudgement of these later Princes, and that Syr Edward doth but squeese and strayne them, to make them say or signify somewhat, which they neuer meant indeed: and this iniquity is not the least in the Attorneys proceeding in this matter, and yet doth M. Morton say of him, as you haue heard, exhorting euery man to resort vnto Syr Edwards storehouse for aboundance of good proofes, saying, habet ille quod det, & dat nemo largius, he hath store to giue, and no man giueth more liberally. Now then we shall peruse some of his store.
               86. Vnder K. Edward 1. he alleageth this instance for proofe of his supposed Ecclesiasticall Iurisdictiō,4. E. 1. Reportes fol. 13. a.

                        is.
                   that all such as had beene twice married are depriued of all priuiledge of Clergy men, and are subiect to the iurisdiction of the secular Court; There arose a question in

England in tyme of Parliament how this decree of the Pope should be executed, and obserued, some of the Prelates inclining, that it should be vnderstood only of such Bigamies, as should fall out after the Coū
                  cell: and therfore demaunded to haue deliuered into their hands, and freed from the temporall gaole, such as presently were in prison, and had beene bigamies before the Councell. But the K. & his Counsell were rather bent to haue all bigamies excluded frō that priuiledge, both present and to come, for that the Popes Constitution now alleaged seemed rather to sound that way: for that it is generall and without exception. Vpon which determination produced, the Attorney hath this note, insteed of an inference: Obserue (saith he) how the King by aduise of his Counsell (that is by authority of Parlament) expounded how this Councell of Lyons should be vnderstood,
                  
                     Reports p. 5. pag. 13. 
                  and in what sense it should be receyued and allowed. And therof would inferre, that the king and his Counsell held themselues to be aboue the Pope, for that they tooke vpon them to determine in what sense the Popes decree should be vnderstood. And yet M. Attorney protesteth as before you haue heard, that he maketh no inferences, but only alleageth the bare law books as they lye, but yet heere euery man will see that it is vntrue: for that heere he maketh an inference, and that very false and impertinent. For he should rather haue made the quite contrary inference, to wit, that for so much as the King and his Coū
                  sell did subiect themselues to the acknowledgment and obseruation of the Popes decree, and did accommodate the law of England therunto (which before was otherwise) they did therby acknowledg that the Popes power in making lawes for Ecclesiasticall matters, was Superiour to that of the King: and can Syr Edward or any man else deny this consequence? And this shall suffice for this case; but only I may

not let passe this one note by the way,Arraigned. that wheras M. Attorneys words are, that certayne Prelats when such persons as haue beene attaynted for fellons,Attainted. haue praied to haue them deliuered as Clerkes, he forgot himselfe, for that the wordes in the booke are: quando de felonia rectati

                     The statut of 9. E. 2. Articuli Cleri. c. 16. 
                  and by consēt of Parlament &c. had graunted vnto them to haue iurisdiction in those cases &c. So M. Attorney. And what doth he inferre heerof thinke you? the questiō in hand teacheth vs, to wit, that K. Edward 2. is proued by this to haue had supreeme spirituall iurisdiction. An inference you will say, very farre fecht: but this is the manner of Syr Edwards disputing, and yet he saith, that he maketh no inference, nor argumentatiō at all: marke then his guilfulnes.
               88. He cō
                  
                     •
                  esseth that before king Edward the 2. there was generall allowance and vse of Ecclesiasticall Courts in England for Ecclesiasticall matters,
                  18. E. 1. as appeareth by the ordinance of Circumspectè agatis, vnder K. Edward 1. and of magna Charta before him againe vnder K. H. 3. & many other proofes: he confesseth also that this vse and allowance was confirmed according to the Custome of his Ancestours by the same K. Edward 2. by a new statute made in the ninth yeare of his raigne, called Articuli

Cleri. But what of this? hence he inferreth, that the king was supreme in spirituall authority, for that he graunted (
                     •
                  aith he) to them to haue iurisdiction: and do you see the good consequence? I will reason with him in the like. The parlamēt de prerogatiuis Regis held in the 17. yeare of the same K. raigne did nū
                  ber and explaine and confirme all the kings prerogatiues which were allowable at the cōmon law: ergo, this statute did giue vnto the king his prerogatiues, and that he had them not before: which consequēce I doubt not but M. Attorney himselfe will deny to be good, and yet is it as good as the other: for K. Edward 2. in his statute of Articuli Cleri, did but concurre with his Ancestours in confirming those priuiledges which had beene vsed before, time out of mind, and in subiecting his temporall lawes to the lawes of the Church in the cases there specified: so farre of was he frō taking supreme iurisdiction vpon himselfe, as falsely and fondly M. Attorney would make his reader belieue. But let vs passe from K. Edward 2. to his sonne K. Edward the third, out of whose raigne M. Attorney alleageth more examples & instances, then almost out of all the rest, wherof we shall touch some few, for all would be ouer longe, and perhaps we shall descēd no lower then the time of his raigne, reseruing the more

                  ull discussion of these, and other exāples, vntill the Catholicke Deuine or some body for him shall prepare a second edition of his forsaid answer to Syr Ed. Reports.
               89. First then fol. 14. b. of this his fifth part of Reports; he reciteth out of the raigne of this K. Edward 3. (but quoting no particuler place) that it is often resolued, that all the Bishopricks within England were 
                        •
                     ounded by the kings progenitors, and therfore the aduowson of them all belonged to the king &c. And that when a Church with cure is void, if the particul

within the space of 6. monethes, then may the Metropolitan conferre the same:

                      dealing. 
                  and if he also do it not within six other moneths, then the comon law giueth to the king, as to the supreme within his owne kingdome, & not to the Bishop of Rome, power to prouide a competent pastour for that Church. This is Syr Ewdards narration, full of deceipt as now you shall see. For albeit the cōmon law doth giue to the king as to the supreme within his owne Kingdome to present by lapse, as hath beene said: yet not as supreme in spirituall authority, as he would haue his reader mistake and belieue; but as supreme in the temporall patronage, or as supreme temporall Patron of that Benefice to whō in such cases the aduowson of presenting belongeth, as appeareth euidently by Cirendon, and the Bishop of Lincolnes case in Plowdens Commentaries, fol. 498.
                     Plowd. Cō. fol. 498. where it is said, that because all aduowsons and lands within the realme are held eyther immediatly or mediatly of the King, & the land where the Church is situate before the Church was builded, was held of the king, so in respect of the tenure of the king, the presentment by lapse accrueth vnto him, as supreme Patron, and not in respect of the supreme iurisdiction Ecclesiasticall, which the Statute of 25. H. 8.25. H. 8. did first of all ascribe vnto his temporall Crowne.
               90. Vnder the same king 17. E. 3.23. he citeth another law-booke thus:
                     Reports f. 14. b. 17. E. 3.23. 
                  The king may not only exempt any Ecclesiasticall person from the iurisdiction of the Ordinary, but may graunt vnto him Episcopall iurisdiction, as thus it appeareth there, the king had done in ancient tyme to the Archdeacon of Richmond. So he. But if you read the booke it self here cited of 17. E. 3 23. you shall fynd that no such assertion can be founded there. For thus the case standeth in that booke: Stouff a Sergeant at law sayd, that the Archdeacon of Richmond had the office of the Ordinary,

                  oule fitten, for his booke hath not these words, in respect of the kings supreme Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction (which is heere made the principall verbe of this part of speach, and often thrust in by M. Attorney of his owne inuentiō,) but the meaning of his booke is, as he cannot but know, that the king in such cases shall present, not in respect of supreme Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction, but as supreme Patron temporall; for that aduowsons, or patronage of such benefices are meere temporall inheritances, according to our cōmon-lawes, as oftē hath beene declared, and therfore the King being founder, may by lapse present.
               93. An other like fitten or rather more foule is cō
                  mitted by him in the same place, alleaging out of 22. Edward. 3. lib. Assis. pl. 75. that tythes arising in places out of any parish,

                     nd (saith he) it is euident, that no man, vnlesse he be Ecclesiasticall, or haue Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction can haue inheritance of tythes. Thus much M. Attorney to proue that K. Ed. 3. had supreme Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction, & not the Pope in his dayes. But heere be so many scapes, fraudes and errours, as is a shame to see. For first in his booke quoted there is not foūd those words (that principally import the controuersie) that he, as hauing

supreme Ecclesasticall iurisdiction
                        •
                      is bound to prouide a sufficiēt Pastour, but all this is thrust in by M. Attorney to make vp his market. Secondly much lesse is this yeelded for a reason, by his booke, why the king should haue such tythes, as lay out of all parishes: but another reason more substantiall is to be alleaged (of being temporall Lord of the Lands) which presently we shall touch.
               94. Thirdly it is not true, that the king, as hauing supreme Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction is bound to prouide a sufficiēt Pastour to haue cure of soules, of that place which is not within any parish, both for that it may appertaine to a particuler subiect to dispose of those tythes,Poure vn

Fourthly it is false, that by the common-laws of England no man vnlesse he be Ecclesiasticall, or haue Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction, can haue the disposing of tythes, for that euery man before the diuision of particuler parishes was made, though he was bound by diuine and Canonicall-law to pay his tythes of his lands: yet might he according to the cō
                  mon-lawes of England haue assigned them to what Parish he would. Now let vs see the case it selfe, as it is proposed in 22. Ed. 3. lib. As

                  Thorp chief Iustice. 
                  that it was wont to be law, when there is a certayne place that is not of any parish, as in Engelstwood and such like, that the king should haue the tythes

So he. And this is all the Case: wherin you see that albeit Iustice Thorp said, that it was wont to be law, that the king should dispose of the tythes of such places, as w

                  tence of execution against the defendants, albeit they had made default after they had pleaded to the issue, as there is manifest, but would haue the Archbishop of Cāterburies sute to the cōtrary to be heard also. And indeed he could not but know, but that in the booke of 7. Ed. 3. fol. 5. (which was 16. yeares before this case was treated) the opinon of Herle chiefe Iustice was,7. E. 3. f. 5. that the Bishop should haue such tythes: and much lesse doth Iustice Thorp assign the cause of right of those tythes vnto the king, for that he hath supreme Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction, as our Iudge doth now: but for that commonly such new wast asserted landes, appertained vnto the king, albeit as now hath beene said, they might haue appertayned also to a particuler subiect, if he had beene Lord of the place, as is most perspicuously declared, and set forth in an ancient Treatise intituled: O

                      the power of the Parliament, annexed to the Old Doctour and Student, or booke so intituled: where it is said as followeth.

tythes be spirituall: yet the assignement of tythes to other, is a temporall act. For before parishes were deuided, and before it was ordayned by the lawes of the Church that euery man should pay tythes to his owne Church, euery man might haue payed his tythes to what Church he would, & might one yeare haue giuen his tythes to one Church, and another yeare to another, or haue graunted them to one Church for euer if he would. And like as euery man before the seuering of the parishes might haue giuen the tythes to what Church he would, because he was bound to no Church in certayne: so may they do now that haue lādes that lie in no parish: for they be at liberty to assigne thē to what Church they will as all men were before the sayd law was made, that tythes should be payd to their proper Churches.

Nor did the king translate Chanons Secular into Regular, which belonged vnto the Pope, but graunted only and gaue licence, that they might be so transferred; nor hath the law-booke any one word of the kings Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction, but all this is feigned by M.

                     selues: whereof M. Attorney would inferre the kings supreme spirituall authority, and iurisdiction. But his booke fauoureth him not at all heerin, for albeit Candish said that the possessions of the Abbot & Prior of VVestminster were seuered the one from the other,Candish. and that this began with the Charter of the king, yet is it playne by the law 11. H. 4. fol. 10.11. H. 4. fol. 10. that the Abbot and Prior of VVestminster had their possessiōs in seueralty from tyme to tyme out of mynd &c. Nor is there any thing spokē there of the kings graūt at all: and if there were, yet must it be vnderstood according to that which is declared by the Catholicke Deuine of the concession and confirmation of priuiledges granted by Pope Leo the 9. and Nicolas the 2. to K. Edward the Confessor concerning the said Monastery of VVestminster,

H. 4. saith,11. H. 4. and that the Grant of the K. was but his allowance and good leaue to the same.

                   And as for his speaches (especially his Charges giuen vpon the Bench) I haue said somewhat before: and how bitter, false and iniurious they are, alleaging in particuler some passages of his Charge giuen at the Assises of Norwich vpon the 4. of August 1606. published in print by R. P. & dedicated to the Right honorable Earle of Excester: which two leters of R. P. I knew not at that tyme whom they meant, vntill now in this Latin Preface Syr Edward calleth him inuidum & maledicum Pricket,
                  R Prick. accused by Syr Edw. an enuious and slaunderous Pricket, for that belike he had pricked somwhat his Lordshipps patience by the edition of his said Charge without his licence: he adding moreouer, That the said Pricket had not set downe any one least sentence of his speach truly and sincerely in

that sense and signification wherin himselfe had vttered the same, which no doubt was a great fault in Pricket, if it were true.
               103. But on the other syde is first the protestation of Pricket himselfe,
                     Pricket in the Epist. dedicatory to the Charge.
                   who saith to the foresaid Earle, shewing both his sincerity and affection towards the Iustice.
If therfore in this following worke (saith he) my memory hath giuen a true instruction to my pen, I hope my labours shall be accompted profitable, when it administreth a publike benefyt. And agayne: I humbly craue your Honour will vouchsafe to patronize this litle booke by me collected, not out of myne owne, but frō the words of that Reuerend, and learned Iudge the L. Cooke; who at his comming vnto Norwich, did vpon the Bench deliuer a Charge so excellent, as that it worthily deserueth to be continued in perpetuall memory.
                  
These are Prickets words, which seeme to free him much from the passion of enuy and malediction obiected by Syr Edward, whom he pretendeth greatly to honour by this edition of his speach. And that no affection towards Catholiks did biaz him in this relation, may appeare by his other words that presently did ensue after the former, saying:
I hope that this speach being produced to a publike view, shall remayne vnto our publike weale a worthy president, wherin Romes Champions may with shame discerne their long continued shamefull practises; Puritans and Schismatiks learne to know with what iniustice they disturbe the happines of our most happy Peere.
                  
So Pricket, who sheweth himselfe as you see a perfect Protestant in profession, and therby it is made very probable that the enuie obiected vnto him by Syr Edward did not arise vpon any di
                     •
                  parity or partiality of religion (notwithstanding it may be that the difference of their two particuler states in purse and wealth considered, Pricket being a poore souldiour,

might enuy somewhat the rich lawiers great wealth and aboundant flowing fortunes.) For thus he beginneth his Epistle to the said Earle, lamenting his owne penurie.
               
                  104. May it please your Honour, the obseruation, which this world begets, may teach experience truly to report, that loue and charity are for the most part growne so cold,Pore Pricket a cold in the heat of his gospelling sunshine. euen in the hoatest sunshine of our profession, as that despised pouerty, though addicted to the religious exercise of endeauours cōmendable, is in the best imployment (which seemeth with greatest fauour to smile vpō our hope) so coldly recompenced, as that poore, vnpittied, deiected, and miserable pouerty knoweth neyther meanes nor place, how or where to warme herselfe. Vnhappy I in this best tyme of greatest happines, who being, as I am, a poore despised, hated, scorned, and vnrespected souldiour, so vnfortunate, as no commended meanes (though many vsed with confirmation both of loue and loyalty) can be of power to raise a spirit drowned in the worst of misery frō despayres gulfe &c.
Wherby it may appeare that Prickets chief endeauour was rather indirectly by laying forth his owne temporall needs to draw somewhat from Syr Edwards purse, and by writing the story of his glorious speach at Norwich, to gayne vnto himself his good will and affection for his reliefe, then any way to shew malignity against him: wherof I fynd no cause or probability, but rather his pricking stomake against vs, whom Syr Edward also impugned, and consequently, if any thing be found in his narration, that at this present displeased Syr Edward, it must be thought to proceed eyther from the errour of the others memory that directed not well his pen, or from some change of mynd in Syr Edward himselfe who now perhaps reprehendeth that which before

he misliked not, but was well content to haue it published. And to this later coniecture I am the rather induced to incline for that there are now two yeares past & more, since Pricket set forth in print this speach, and I neuer heard that Syr Edward did mislike it, vntill at this present I see it so greiuously reprehended by him in this last Preface: for in the former that was prefixed before his sixt part of Reports (which seemeth to haue come forth after Prickets relation) no complaynt or mention is made therof.
               105. But you will aske me (perhaps) why so great a charge should be found in Syr Edward,
                  Why Syr Edw. misliketh now Prickets narration. that he should so sharpely and vehemently inueigh against that which before he liked, or at leastwise tolerated for so long tyme; wherunto truly I know not what other thing to answere, but that it may be, that the exceptions I tooke in my answer to M. Morton against diuers things in that narration, as notorious vntruthes might displease or stinge somewhat Syr Edward, who hauing no list to answere the matters thē
                  selues, thought best to fall aboard the relator, & to lay the fault on him, saying, that he hath not related matters aright: wherin as I meane not to excuse him, so on the other side it seemeth very hard vnto me, that the substance of those points, wherin I touched Syr Edwards vntrue dealing, and many other, wherin I might haue said much more, should be feigned, or deuised by Pricket, or related by him more maliciously against vs, then they were meant or vttered by the Iustice himself, which is euident, partly by that which I haue heard to be continued still by him both there, and in other places, where since that tyme he hath giuen Charges to the Iurie: wherin the greatest part and most bitter of his speach is allwayes commonly against the Catholicks, as though they were the greatest malefactours of the realme, to be inquired of.

And in this very Charge and speach related by Pricket, his malicious in
                     •
                  ectiue against them conteyneth aboue a dozen leaues printed, the whole thing it self scarce being as much againe.
               106. And if you will behold the impertinency & vanity therof, considering the auditory of Norwich his Countrey, where he would needs triumph gloriously in that first Charge (if I be not deceyued) after he was Iudge, you shall fynd it not only like to be Syr Edwards,
                  Syr Edw. parable about a yong Romā Iudge applyed to himself. but worthy also of his veyne in that vanity: for that hauing first by a seuerall Exordium set down a tale of a Noble yong Roman that was by the Senate made a Iudge in his tender yeares, and for diuers reasons and considerations of the dignity therof made some delay, and difficulty in admitting the same, he did notwithstanding vpon some friends persuasion yeald at length to accept therof: all which Parable the Iustice applying to himselfe, beginneth his Charge with such plausible Oratoricall wisedomes eloquence (to vse the words of his Relatour M. Pricket) as first he expounded vnto them vpon his fingers the Grammaticall verse: Quis, quibus, quid, quomodo, and, de quibus, that is: who sent this Commission? to wit, his Maiesty. To whom? to Syr Edward, and others vnder him. What did it cō
                  teyne? Great and high authority. How must it be executed? By doing iustice. Of whom and what causes must inquiry be made? Principally, and in the first place against Catholiks that do professe the Roman religion and obedience of the Pope.
               107. And is not this a goodly deduction? Was there euer any English Iudge before the Apostacy of Martyn Luther, that gaue a Charge from the bench against such men, for being such? If all the Iudges & lawiers of our Nation that euer gaue Charges to inquire of malefactours for nine hundred yeares together,

and more in our Iland after Christian religion receyued, did giue such a Charge, & for such a crime then hath Syr Edward somewhat to excuse his insolency heerin. But if there be none, as most certainly there is not: how then doth he performe his promise made heere in this new Latin Preface of auoyding fiue things in setting downe his Reports?

                   Wherof the fourth he termeth Nouitatem, Nouelty, which he defyneth to be then, when,Syr Edw. protesteth against Nouelity when he practizeth the same. 
                  si ad amussim nostrorum librorum, & antiquorum exempla applicentur, nequaquam quadrant. If the things which he speaketh being applyed to the exact rule of their law-bookes, and examples of their ancients, do not agree therunto: Which he holdeth for a thing most vnworthy of their profession, indignissimam studiis nostris. VVherefore eyther he must bring forth such ancient bookes, lawes, and examples for himself and his cause (that precedent Iudges haue giuen such Charges) or els he conuinceth himselfe to be most vnworthy of that place and dignity of law which he holdeth.
               108. But to returne to the Charge giuen at Norwich:
                     Charge p. 10. after he had expounded the verse of Quis, Quibus &c. according to his manner of ostentation, he beginneth his narratiō thus:
                     Pag. 18. 
                  Our worlds admired Queene renowned Elizabeth, did, as you do know, in the beginning of her Raigne, change the State of religion in this kingdome, in her first Parliament, by the consent of her Lordes Spirituall & Temporall &c. and then he goeth forward to shew the continuall reclayme, and resistance made by Catholicke men from tyme to tyme for their religion: wherby thinking to disgrace them as rebellious, for their reluctation, doth in deed giue them the highest cō
                  mendation that can be giuen to Christian men, which is to stand firme & constāt to the worlds end in their Religion once receiued, and continued to their tyme. And for himsel

                  e doth insinuate therby,

that for the gayning of aduancement, and pleasing a worlds admired Queene, or any other worldly Prince, it were no hard matter to make him admit any change of Religion whatsoeuer, for so much as he alloweth so easily of this, which this VVoman-Queene made with admiration and wonder o

                      the world: & yet doth he vtter a notorious vntruth in that he saith, she did it by the cō

                  e part of the Parlament) resisted the matter, as appeareth by their depriuations, depositions, restraints or imprisonments that theron ensued. So as this is as true, as that other which followeth in the very next page, and hath beene handled by me in other places, to wit, that as well these that were restrayned or imprisoned, as generally all the Papists of this Kingdome, did come to the Protestants Church, nor any of them did resuse during the first ten yeares of the said Queenes gouernment, which I haue cōuinced 
                     Supra §. 4. before by hundreds of witnesses, to be most shamefully false, as also the other deuised fable, that Pius Quimꝰ did offer to approue the Communion Booke of English seruice by his owne letters to Q. Elizabeth, if she would do him the honour as to accept it from him.

                  Aue Rex Iudaeorum: but yet there the maister Iudge did not descend to such scurrility. But surely I am sory to see a Lord Iudge vse the same in publike auditory, which were fitter for one of his Kitchin amongst his

Companions: and when such things as these are related vnto strangers, they seeme incredible to men of e

               110. But Syr Edward passing on in this manner throughout his whole speach, bringeth in all the accidents fallen out frō the beginning of that Raigne vnto the end of the Irish warres, Doctor Sanders his being there, Steukley his going to Rome, and afterward to Portugall: the Duke of Guise his actions, and of Mē
                     doza, called by him Iesuite, though he were a Noble man, and Ambassadour of the K. of Spaine in Englād, Campian, Persons, Heywood, Shirwyn, and other Priests comming into England vpon the yeare 1580. and many other such like things little appertayning to them of Norwich, but that my L. would needs speake like a great Counsellour that day, and be Propheta in Patria, and fill mens eares with tales, and terrours: and yet in the end after all sayd, and much therof knowne to be false to the greatest part of discret men in his auditory, he commeth at length to be somewhat mor

               111. And do you see this Conclusion, all groū
                  ded

vpon suppositions, that are manifestly false, or  rather ridiculous in thēselues: for that first he would haue vs suppose, as a thing by him proued before, that it is not religion, for which we striue, but to maintayne the Popes supreme Authority in spirituall Causes, as though the article of supremacy were no poynt of Religion at all among vs,The Article of supremacy in Spirituall matters, of how great importance. which is a great absurdity to imagine. For doth not the Catholicke Deuine in the Preface of his Answere vnto him (and we before haue also repeated the same) shew & demonstrate that this point of supreme spirituall authority, is so principall an article of Religion, as all other controuersies may be determined therby? How then doth the Iustice trifle so in this matter? Is he not ashamed to say in the face and ears of such an Auditory, that Catholi
                        •
                     kes striue not for religion, whē they striue for their supreme Pastours spirituall Authority? It is as good an argument, as if a man should say, that Syr Edward when he was a Counsellour pleaded not for money, but for gold: as if gold were no money.
               
                   112. His second supposition is, that we belieue Pope Pius Quintus to haue allowed the Protestant Cō
                  munion Booke, for that Syr Edward saith, and sweareth it vpon his credit, saying: and this vpon my credit, and as I am an honest man is most true: which I haue els where shewed to be most vntrue, and that no Catholicke  of cr
                     •
                  dit doth or will giue credit vnto it. Thirdly he supposeth that we belieue his former assertion, that all Catholickes generally did come to the Protestants C
                        •
                     urch for the first ten yeares of Q. Elizabeths raigne, which they do not only thinke, but know to be most false.
               113. Fourthly he supposeth it to be a good consequence,  that if Catholicks did come to their Churches for the first ten yeares, they haue inough for

their saluation: and need not the help of any Popes authority, for absolution of their sinnes, or other spirituall power: For such is his inference, when he s
                     •
                  ith: Deare Country-men, we haue then inough, and need not any help of any Pope, sithence all the Papists generally came to our 
                        •
                     hurches, be
                        •
                     ore the late Queene was excommunicated: which inference and consequence is both false and absurd. For albeit some Catholicks came to the Church for feare or otherwise; yet therby haue not Syr Edward and his partners inough for their saluation, for that the other came to their Churches; for they might come with a repugnant mynd, condemning and detesting inwardly their Religion, no lesse, or perhaps more, then they that were Recusants, and openly refused to come, as no doubt, but at this day also many do, who are forced to Church against their consciences.
               114. And it is to be noted that Syr Edward saith: VVe haue a doctrine of 
                        •
                     aith and Religion s
                        •
                     fficiently necessary to saluation: So as he ascribeth no perfection to his Religion, nor any aboundant sanctitie, latitude, or degrees of holines, one aboue the other; but if it be sufficiently necessary, it is inough for him. And yet doth our Sauiour say:
                     Ioan. 14.
                        •
                     . Mat. 5. & 19.

                      my Father; and exhorteth men to perfection, Perfecti estote, which importeth somewhat more, then sufficiently necessarie. But if seemeth that Syr Edward would be content with a litle, and go no further then necessarily he must. God grant he go so farre, and keepe him in charitie,
                     Charge p. 40. in which heere he seemeth in part to be by his offer of vnion and agreement, though in the very next leafe he falleth into extremities agayne, saying: That the most sacred person of Gods annoynted, king Iames, whome Pope Clement the ninth could proudly dare to terme the Scottish Her
                        •
                     ticke, shall vnderneath his Princely foote, tread downe Romes

faithlesse, Papall, proud, and Antichristian heresy &c.
               
               115. Do you see where the man is againe? Euen now you haue heard him ascribe so much to Pope Pius Quintus, as for that he was presumed (though falsely) to offer the allowance of the English Communion booke to Q. Elizabeth,
                  Syr Edw. intemperate rayling if she would take it of him, that therfore they had a doctryne of faith & religiō sufficiētly necessary to saluation, for that the Pope had allowed it: and yet now he turneth to his old rayling, calling the Romā faith, Romes faithlesse, Papall, proud, Antichristian heresy: And therby maketh all Christian kings that acknowledg the Popes spirituall authority to be faithlesse & Antichristian heretikes. How will this soūd in the eares of all forraine Monarches, and greatest Potentates that are touched therby? Is this intemperate speach befitting a Iudges person? yea a Chiefe Iudge? But there is nothing more intolerable in this speach, then the base & odious flattering of his Maiesty, which vice it is read that diuers magnanimous Princes haue more hated and punished, then any cryme besides; yea next vnto treason it selfe, especially when it is conioyned with notorious falsity as this is, when he saith, That Pope Clement the ninth (he should haue said the eyght) could proudly dare to terme the Scottish hereticke, which is indeed a famous English calumniation deuised by himselfe, or others, and can neuer be proued to be true: for that Pope Clement spake euer very respectiuely of his Maiesty in all occasions, both when he was in Scotland, and after: Neyther will the contrary be found in any of his writings. Wherfore it is both shamefull and shamelesse, that such open vntruthes should be spoken in publike audience without controlment. But let vs goe forward to a point or two more.
               116. After his former exhortatiō & inuitation to

draw Catholicks to his doctryne of faith and religion sufficiently necessary to saluation, he pas
                     •
                  eth to another point of threatning: first, that his Maiesty will neuer giue any toleration to Catholicks: and the second, that in the meane space,
                     Charge p. 36.37. while they hope in vaine, they shall abide the smart of punishments. The first he proposeth in these words: If there be any Papist so 
                        •
                     oolish, and altogeather reasonlesse, as to expect, that his Maiesty may be drawne to such alteration or toleration, as they desire, I will them assuredly to know, they hope in vaine. The second he setteth downe thus: Such Papists as notwithstanding the impossibility of their hope, will still remaine peruerse, let them know for certainty, that the lawes concerning them shall receiue a most strict and seuere execution against them.
               
               117. This is the dreadfull denunciation of our new Iudge, wherby you see, that in the one he forestalleth absolutly his Maiesties will,The forestaling of his Maiesties will. not only for the present, but for all time to come, further, perhaps, then he hath commission to take vpon him. For what knoweth he what God may inspire his Maiesty in succeeding yeares? Or what other reasōs and circumstances of time, place, and state of things may induce his Royall Wisdome prudently and piously for benefit of his subiects to alter somwhat his present resolution? Is not the hart of kings in the hands of God?
                  
                     Prouerb. 21. Wil my L. Iustice so make himselfe Pedagogue and Maister of his Maiesties will, as he will define or predetermine before hand, what he shall doe, or what he shall not doe for the time to come? This is very predominant indeed, and were more then inough for a whole Counsell to doe: but much more and farre ouermuch for him, that hitherto, so farre as I know, hath noe place among them. We cannot but hope better of his Maiesties pious disposition, and trust, that in time we shall say also,
                     Rom. 5. 
                  Spes non confundit:

notwithstanding the desperate resolution of Syr Edward to the contrary.
               118. And as for the second point of his threatning punishment and vexation to Catholickes, it is litle to be wondred at, and lesse to be esteemed in such a Cause as they suffer for. Lesse to be wondred at; for that such animosity of spirit is wont often to accompany them, that rise in hast to excessiue wealth and authority ouer others: lesse to be esteemed by Catholicks, who both take it for a glory to suffer for their Religion, and haue learned by experience of former tymes, that God is wont to extend his hand, and make an arrest, euen then, when those that persecute his seruants are most in their heate of pursuite against them. And I could wish that Syr Edward did but looke ouer the two ancient written Bookes, the one of Tertullian to Scapula; the other of S. Cyprian, in imitation of the former to Demetrianus, both of them persecuting Iudges:Example of two persecuting Iudges. whome the said Authors do earnestly exhort to looke vpon the endes of such, as had beene their persecutours in that their office before.

happy therin. But howsoeuer this be, I say to our Iudge, as Tertullian sayd to his, when he layd before him the sayd examples: Non te terremus, quia nec time
                     
                        •••
                     , we do not go about to terrify you, for that neither do we feare you in this cause, though I know you may vexe vs, as you haue donne, and do: but when all is donne, our hope is where it was, in the Highest;
                     Math. 10. and our assurance and protection is the warrant of our Maister: Nolite timere eos, qui corpus occidunt &c. Doe not feare those that can vexe or kill the body, and afterward can do noe more: but feare him that after this life can cast into hell, and euerlasting torments: and this Iudge must our Iudge feare also. For he is Iudge of Iudges, and can both reuerse iudgments, and reuoke sentences at his pleasure.
               119. And thus much haue we bene induced to speake and repeate againe in this matter of this Norwich-Charge, by occasion of Syr Edwards accusation of Pricket in setting downe the same: wherin if he had gone about to recall or mislike any part therof, as ouer iniurious to Catholicks, we should haue accepted therof most gratefully, and adioyned with him in the iust reprehension of Pricket, as hauing related that speach more maliciously, then it was meant against vs, but I can discouer no such meaning or moderation in Syr Edward by that he hath written since that time, or spoken againe in that place: whereof I haue heard by some that were present, that he hath borne himselfe no lesse insolently, then in the former speach, especially bringing in tales against Monks, to get applause therby of the vulgar people against that order of Religious men in the Catholike Church: whereof you haue heard one example before of the Prior, that was feigned to haue gotten by fraud a Gentlemans land in helping him to make

his Testament: another was of an Abbot that made an inclosure, and tooke in a high way within his inclosure, and for that there was a rough and rude Country-man, that brake downe his inclosure,Syr Edw. tale of the fighting Abbot. saying that he would passe where his father and grandfather had passed, the Abbot being a lustie, tall, fat, and strong knaue, sayth Syr Edward, desiring to fight hand to hand with this clowne or country-man, when he was to repasse that way, tooke on a seruing mans apparrel (if you will belieue the story) went to the place, watched his returne, ioyned with him in combat, and was well beaten by him. And then did Syr Edward both laugh hartily, and giue God thankes, that he had found out such a History to tell them in that place: and further he sayd that he was hartily glad, that it fell vpon an Abbot. And was not this graue matter, thinke you, for a Iudge to treate in that place and auditory? VVhat would the Roman Senate haue thought of their yong Roman Iudge, (whose imitation it seemeth that Syr Edward, in the beginning of his Speach had prefixed vnto himselfe) if they had vnderstood that from the Bench and Seate of Iustice, euen pro rostris, he had vsed such leuity of speach and action, as this is?
               120. But heere now it may be, that my L. will be some-what displeased to haue his things published abroad,Syr Edw. loude tongue in speaking ill of Catholicks. which he did but speake for his priuate pleasure, mirth, and triumph in his Countrie of Norwich. But the fault is his owne in speaking it so lowdely, and not obseruing the counsaile of his Honourable friend; who hearing him one day o

of this also it seemeth, that his Lordship hath thought now vpon a more effectuall way to be free from these admonishments from beyond the seas. For in this new last Preface of his, after a great reprehension of those, that write in these our times saying, Quotidie plures, quotidie peius s

                     ribunt: that euery day more do write, and do write worse (wherin I doubt not but his owne writings are excepted by his Lordship, being also a moderne writer himselfe) he cōmeth to pronounce this terrible sentence vpon all Catholicke bookes and writings, that come from abroad: Si quisquam hominum &c. Yf any man shall bring into England any of those Bookes,

This is his denunciation and determination,A dreadfull new cōminatiō of Syr Edw. against all Catholick bookes. which he prooueth not otherwise in this Preface, but only by his owne asseueration. It may be that he will go about to prooue it afterward out of some lawes, that he is to relate in this his seauenth Part of Reportes: and that he will do it as substantially, as he prooueth before in his fifth part, that Q Elizabeth and her predecessours according to the ancient common-lawes of England had supreme Ecclesiasticall authority. Yf he doe, somewhat may chance to be sayd to the booke, whē it shall be seene, for hitherto I haue had no view therof at all: only I must needs say heere; that in wise and indifferent mens iudgmēt Syr Edward being a writer himselfe against Catholickes, and hauing therby prouoked them to answere him (as before you haue heard how ioyfull he was when any obiections

were made by the Student against his writings, and the more, saith he, the better:) he hath not prouided well for his credit and honour, to go about now to barre all writing on our side, by terrour of penalties, yea & of death it self. For this is plainly to prouoke to the field: and then to get a proclamation, that if his enemy do ouercome him, his victory shalbe death.
               121. But I cannot perswade my self that Syr Edward will easily get any such, vniust, and dishonorable refuge for his defence. For either he must procure it to be decreed of new by some moderne law; which being so vnreasonable I cannot expect from the wisedoms of so many graue men that must haue voyc
                     •
                   therin: or he will deduce it out of some ancient lawes of England: and therin I dare ioyne with him, that he is not able to do it.
               122. VVherefore my counsayle should rather be to Syr Edvvard,
                  A charitable and equall offer to Syr Ed. that either he would cease to prouoke vs by writing, or intemperate speaking against Catholickes, or take in good part our temperate answers, or cause them with like temperance to be confuted by himself, or by some on his part, or so finally change his course towards vs, as we may haue no speciall cause to complayne of him more then of others: which were a farre better way in my opiniō, to peace and profit of both parts, then by terrour of punishments to seeke to oppresse all Catholicke writings, which will be very hard for him to do. And when it should succeed, he were like to gaine least of all therby: For that most probable it is, that in such a case they would all turne their pennes against himself, insteed of other argument by his meanes prohibited.
               123. And this is as much as I haue to say about this last Preface, which commeth intituled thus: Deo,

Patriae, Tibi, signifying therby, as I comprehend the matter,About the intituling of his 7. part of Reports. that this seauenth Part of his Reports now come forth, is dedicated as seruiceable to all those three; to God, our Country, and the Reader: which if it be no otherwise written then the fifth Part, that I haue read, it may very well be returned againe by the Reader saying: N
                        •
                     c Deo, nec Patriae, nec Mihi: It is neyther profitable, nor seruiciable to Gods honour, nor to our Countrey, nor to Me. Not to God; for that it impugneth his only true and Catholike Religion, and that by false and indirect meanes, whereof God is an enemie. Not to our Country; for that these Reports of law being contrary to all auncient lawes, and written with a contrary spirit to all our ancient lawiers, Iudges, & law-makers, before this our present age, can profit nothing our Country; but set greater breaches and diuisions therein. To Me also, that am the Reader or Student, it can neither profit, nor import any thing, but losse of time, and breaking my head with con

                  radictions: For so much as all this must once againe be cast of and forgotten, as nouelties. when our old course of Commonlaw must returne to follow her ancient streame againe.
               124. Wherfore a much more honourable and profitable course had it bene for so great a witt, & learned a man in our lawes, as my L. is said & held to be, that to the end his labours in writing might haue remayned gratefull and commodious to posterity, he had conformed himselfe, his spirit, knowledge and penne, to that of ancient precedent lawyers of our land, as Plowden did, and some others, whose wrytings for that cause wil be immortall. But Syr Edward, taking to himselfe a contrary new course by wrenching and wresting lawes to a contrary meaning frō the common sense, both of the lawes themselues, &

law-makers, as also of the times wherin they were made, and torrent of authority, that gouerned the the same, his labours must needs in the end proue to b
                     •
                   both vnprofitable, and contemptible.
               125. For I would demand him, what sound common lawier will ioyne with him in this point, which he so re
                     •
                  olutly auerreth in his last Preface, that all bookes cōming à Roma, vel à Romanistis, from Rome or Romanists, that is from any sort of Catholicks, haue punishment according to our anciēt lawes (for of those I suppose he speaketh) of losse of goods, liberty and life? Will any man belieue him, that this is conforme to any ancient law of England?

                        •

                     forme to our ancient lawiers. Doth he not know (as I doubt not but he doth much better then I) the old ancient honour, that was wont to be borne to Rome and Romanists, by our English Common lawes? Can he deny but that the Bishop of Rome is tearmed Apostolus and Apostolicus almost eu
                     •
                  ry where in the same ancient lawes? yea Prince of the Church? and that our Archbishop of Canterbury the greatest Peere and Prelate of England, is called in our law Apostoli Legatus, Legate of the Apostle and Roman Bishop? And that his spirituall Court is but a member of the Court of Rome, which Court in England is called Curia Christianitatis, the Court Christian, or Court of Christianity, throughout our Common law-bookes, as I might shew by multiplicity of authorities, if it were not a matter so notoriously knowne, as no meanest lawier will, or can denie it. And is it likely then that according to those lawes it may be prooued, that it is Praemunire and treason, to bring in a Booke from Rome or Romanists, to read it, to praise it, or to lend it to another, as heere our new Iustice doth tell men with terrour against iustice, especially when he addeth, Hi sunt illi libri qui splendidos &c. These are those bookes, which

doe carry goodly and religious titles, which do professe to help and comfort the infirme consciences of men, that are in trouble:
These are they that take vpon them to bring miserable and sinfull soules vnto the desired port of tranquillity and saluation. By which words it seemeth that Syr Edward hath a chi

                     e mislike of spirituall Catholick bookes,Spirituall bookes mislyked by Syr Edward. which treat the argument of quieting of soules.
Which if it be so, then I hope that our bookes of Controuersies may passe with some lesse danger; though indeed I doe suspect, that he meaneth these, when he speaketh of the other; for that they doe most cō
                  cerne him. For what doe spirituall bookes trouble Syr Edward, which I suppose that either he neuer readeth, or litle esteemeth the argument they handle, his cogitations being imployed about farre other obiects of this world for the present? Albeit I doe not doubt, but if in some other circumstance of time, state and condition of things he should read them, or they should be read vnto him, as namely on his death-bed, when flesh and bloud and worldly preferments doe draw to an end, and himselfe neare to the accompting day, they would make other impression in him. Which being so, true wisdome would, that what we must doe in time perforce and perhaps to late, or with out profit, we should out of good will and free choice preuent by Christian industrie. Which almighty God graunt vs his holy grace to doe. And this is all the hurt I wish to Syr Edward for all his asperity against vs.
               126. Now let vs returne to M. Morton againe, whome we haue left for a long time to giue place to this piece of Reckoning with Syr Edward. It followeth then in consequence after the precedēt Chapter of his omissions and concealments in diuers and different charges layd against him for vntruthes, wherwith

he was charged in the Treatise of Mitigation; that we see what new vntruthes he hath super-added in his defence therof, for increasing the burden.
            
         
         
            
            THE NINTH CHAPTER WHICH LAYETH TOGEATHER ANOTHER CHOICE NVMBER of new lyes, made wilfully BY Mr. MORTON ouer and aboue the old, in this his Preamble, whilst he pretendeth to defend, or excuse the sayd old, being aboue fifty in number.
            
               WE haue made a large intermissiō, as you see, of M. Mortōs affayres by interlacing some of Syr Edwards: now must we returne to our principal scope, which is to shew more new and fresh vntruthes of later date in this last Reply of M. Morton. And albeit those that are to be touched in this Chapter haue beene for the most part handled, & discussed before: yet to the end, that they may more effectually be represented to the eye, and memory of the Reader, by putting the principall

Morton hath in hand, that cannot be defended but by addition of so many new lyes vnto his old, and euen then when he standeth vpon his triall for the sayd old, and se

                And no maruaile, for that, both truth, reason, and experience do teach vs, that an old lye can neuer be well cloathed, or couered but by a new. Let vs passe then to the suruey of this Chapter, noting by the way, that we are rather to touch certayne heades, or principall branches that conteine commonly sundry and seuerall lyes vnder them, then simple & single vntruthes if they be well examined: nor is it our purpose to name all, for that would imply too large a prolixity for this place, especially for so much as I am to remit the Read

               ssion of myne: but let M. Morton shew that in all my booke I do confesse, that there is a mentall Equiuocation, which no clause of reseruation can saue from a lye, and then I will graunt that he obtayned somewhat indeed wherabout to wrāgle: but if I do neuer say so, nor he is able to proue it, but rather in other places of his booke doth deliuer me from that Confession,
                  Pream. pag 47. & 48. granting that the wordes, mentall Equiuocation are not myne, but his owne (my wordes being only these; that there is some speach which cannot be saued from a lye, by any reseruation, and not, that there is a Mentall Equiuocatiō which no reseruation can saue 
                     •

            3. First then (as now I haue sayd) it was neuer my mind to affirme, that there is a mentall Equiuocation which no clause o
                     •
                   reseruation can saue from a lye, but rather thus, that there is an outward speach which no clause of reseruation can saue frō a lye,
               
                  Act. 5
                     •
                  
                such as was the speach of Saphyra, for example (for of this was the treaty) when she answered falsely vnto S. Peter her lawfull iudge about the price of her feild that was sold; this speach of hers I sayd in the Treatise of Mitigation,
               
                  Mitig. pag 344.346. & 348. though she might haue a mentall reseruation therin (as M. Morton supposeth her to haue had,) yet could not that reseruation excuse the same from a lye, in respect of the obligation she had absolutly to vtter the truth, which obligation he hath not, who speaketh to one that hath no iurisdiction ouer him, and consequently may equiuocate.
            4. Now then M. Morton to obtayne 
                  •
               his cause by a lye, falsely affirmeth me to say, that there is a mentall

Equiuocation, whi

                  rom a lye, which is in effect to make me speake contraries. For if it be a lye, then can it be no Equiuocation, as out of their proper definitions I haue largely proued in my treatise of that subiect: And if it be a mentall Equiuocation, then must it needs be saued from a lye by mentall reseruation. And finally that my wordes, that there was an outward speach (as namely that of Saphyra) which no mentall reseruation could excuse 
                  •
               rom a lye, and consequently that it could be no Equiuocation, do proue not only my owne wordes, speaking therof, but also the wordes of M. Morton himselfe afterward in the 12. Paragraph of this his Preāble,
                  Pream. pag 47. & 48. where he saith & insulteth thus: P

But now the matter being better examined for that P. R. could not get that worke of Espencaeus when he

wrote his former Treatise, it is found that Espencaeus is so farre of from plaine auerring the same, as he doth not so much as once affirme it of himselfe, but only relateth it, as passionate wordes of cer

Furthermore pag. 25.About Gratian abused. of this his preamble he goeth about to proue Gratian the Compiler of Popes Decrees to haue falsified a Canon of the Councell of Mileuet (wherin S. Augustine was) and for this cause as though he had now prooued the same, he writeth in the margent this note, Gratian a falsificator, for that he had added to the same Canon, a certayne exception which Cardinall Bellarmine doth not allow:

                but now vpon better search it is found, that M. Morton himselfe is the falsificator, and not Gratian, both for that he cutteth of fraudulently the beginning and first wordes of that Canon, and peruerteth the last. For whereas the question was in Africa, whether Priests, Deacons, or inferiour Clergy men, might appeale frō their Bishops of that Coūtrey vnto others abroad (for of Bishops there was no question but they might) the said Councell of Mileuet decreeth thus in the forsayd Canon,The Decree of the Councell of Mileu

               About simbolizing with Pelagians. shewing how Caluin, and diuers other Protestants did simbolize with them in two principall heads of doctrine: wherof the first was about Originall sinne in Infantes (which the Pelagians denyed, and especially in the children of the faythfull) & the other about the distinctiō of veniall & mortall synns, which they also denied, and that Caluin, Zuinglius, Bucer, and other Protestants did hold the same, but with some distinction concerning Originall

sinne; for that Zuinglius denied originall sinne in all men, Caluin and Bucer in Christian infants only, and cōsequently that it was Pelagianisme. Bellarmines words are these;

This is his demaund, and for ground heerof he citeth these latin words of Bellarmine out of the forenamed place: Pelagiani docebant non esse in hominibus peccatum originale, & praecipuè in filijs fidelium. Idem docent Caluinus & Bucerus. The Pelagians did teach that there was not Originall synne in men,
                  Bellar. lib. 4. de notis Ecclesiae c. 9. §. Pelag. especially in the children of the faithfull.

Bishops not to set vp Images in the Churches,About the Councell of Eliberis, & Sixtus Senensis. & the diuers expositions of Catholicke doctours about the same, what the causes and motiues might be of this prohibition for that tyme of the fresh, and new conuersiō of that nation from Idolatrie to Christian Religion, among other expositors he citeth the opinion of Sixtus Senensis for the last vpshot of the whole matter

               So that whatsoeuer the occasion of forbidding might haue beene, this is a confessed conclusion of Senensis, that the Councell of Eliberis did absolutly forbid the worship of Images. And then 
                  •
               etteth down the same in latin in his margent, as out of Senensis al

                  um. But he that shall looke vpon the text of the Authour himself

shall not fynd any such confessed conclusion, or any such words of absolutly forbidding, and consequently this is conuinced to be an absolute vntruth, for it appeareth cleerly in Senensis that the prohibition was only for a time, vntill the new conuerted Spaniards should be better instructed in Christian Religion, and made to vnderstand better the difference betweene Pagan Idols, and sacred Images: so as heere are two grosse falsityes, first in obtruding, as the latin sentence of Senensis, that which Senensis hath not, in words or sense, and then in translating the same so punctually into English, & setting it down in a different letter, as though it were exactly so in good earnest: and can there be any excuse for these sortes of procedings? Let the Reader see more before c. 3. nu. 38.
            14. Gregorius de Valentia is brought in by M. Morton against Bellarmine as allowing of a sentence of Tertullian vsed by Bullinger the Caluinist as orthodoxall,About Bullingers assertion of the Trinity. and iustifiable, to wit, Tres sunt in Diuinitate personae, non statu sed gradu, non substantia sed forma, non potestate sed specie differentes: and M. Morton stoutly cyteth in his margent for approuing therof Gregorius de Valentia Iesuita de vnitate & Trinitate c. 9. §. item Bullingerus, meaning therby to oppose the one of thē against the other in this matter
                  •
                but when the thing is examined, the wordes of Gregorius de Valentia are found to be these: Bullingerus Sacramentarius &c. Bullinger the Sacramentary affirmeth that there are three persons in Deity, which differ not in state but degree, not in substance but forme, not in power but kind: by which wordes (sayth Valentia) he doth not only ouerthrow the Godhead of the sonne, but euen the whole Mystery of the most holy Trinity.
            
            15. So sayth Valētia against Bullinger for whose defēce against Cardinall Bellarmins accusation of Arianisme he is produced. And let the reader iudge whether this be an allowanc
                  •
                of that sentence for orthodoxall, which Valentia sayth, as yow see, to be so blasphemous as it

doth ouerthrow the whole mystery of the Blessed Trinity. And the lyke lye yow may behold vttered by M. Morton against Cardinall Bellarmine himselfe in this very matter, affirming him to expound as orthodoxall and iustifiable, the forsayd hereticall paradox of Tertullian, wheras he expoundeth only in good sen

Augustine for his Authority, who defending the negatiue against S. Cyprians error, to wit, that men returning frō heresy were not to be rebaptized (which was the opinion of the whole Church in his time, & grounded vpon vnwritten tradition of the sayd Church;) reprehended that forme of arguing in S. Cyprian, as not good

For how can it be possible, that our Doctours do belieue the article of Purgatory, if in their owne iudgments they hold & teach that all Scriptures alleaged for the same, and the most part of Fathers, are made to say that which they neuer meant therin, and this by turning, wresting,

and forcing? Is there any man that will admit so violēt a fact as this? Or is there any man so light & foolish, eyther Protesta

M. were vnderstood. and promising to discouer such notorious fashoods against me, as that he would inforce me by vertue of myne owne promise (as he sayth) neuer hereafter to credit my selfe, beginneth with this in the first place, that I in the end of the cō

               About Holinshed Fox & Stow.20. There followeth pag. 80. of his Preamb. a great conuiction of M. Mortons willfull falsity, which I do not see how any wayes possible he can auoyd or excuse:

and the matter is, concerning the testimony of Holinshed in his Chronicle, about the cause of Syr Thom. VViats Rebellion, which M. Morton had stoutly denyed in both his former Bookes of Discouery, & Full Satisfaction to haue had any relatiō to Religiō, or mention therof in his pretence, for which he citeth in his margent Holinshed only Anno 1553. and when against this his Aduersary P. R. cited the playne testimonies of M. Iohn Fox as credible an Authour in his opinion as Holinshed,
               
                  M. Fox an. 1554 pag. 1289. 
               M. Morton in this his last Reply shifteth of this, with saying that his aduersary played the Fox,Strange impudēcy seeking to prey furthest of from home, for that he had cited Holinshed, and to Holinshed he would stand, to wit M. Morton: wherupon P. R. looking better into Holinshed findeth the very selfe same testimony and wordes in effect, which were alleaged before out of Fox; and the like also set downe by Iohn Stow in his Chronicle, which M. Morton could not probably but haue seene. And how then did he make that stout deniall before mentioned in two or three bouts, and now the third tyme doth stand in it also? can this be excused? can this be thought tolerable? can this be defended from wilfull falshood knowne to the speaker? yow may see more of this matter before, Cap. 4. num. 54.55. &c.

            22. It followeth page 111. of the sayd Preamble that M. Morton to disgrace and discredit the Decretalls & Extrauagants of Popes,About Pope Gregories licence for printing the Canon Law. auoucheth that Pope Gregory the 13. of late in this our tyme, did (by a speciall breue) ratifie the Glosses and Annotations (vpon the said Decretals) and gaue thē authority equiualent and answerable to the Decretals & Extrauagants themselues, which seeming a strange fact of the Pope, the sayd Breue prefixed, before that edition of the Canon law, was examined and it was found that Pope Gregory did only therin giue licence and priuiledge, according to custome, for printing the sayd Decretals, Extrauagants, and Corps of the Canō law, togeather with their Glosses and Annotations, as they were set forth in Rome, and Roman edition, without any one word of equalling them in authority the one with the other: which

seemeth so notorious an abuse and imposture, as vnlesse we should imagine M. Morton to be a very simple and senseles man in mistaking quid for quo, which I thinke he would be loath to be accompted, he cānot be excused from manifest wilfull fraud, wherof we haue written before, Cap. 5. num. 92.93.94. &c.
            
            23. In the page. 64. of this preamble M. Morton accuseth Cardinall Bellarmine falsely to haue ascribed vnto Caluin the heresie of the Manicheans,
               About the Manicheā heresy imputed to Caluin. saying: Againe he at
                     •
                  ributeth vnto Caluin the heresie of the Manichees, who (saith he) did condemne the nature of men, depriuing them of Freewill, and ascribing the Originall and beginning of sinne vnto the nature of man, and not vnto his Freewill. So he. But when the Originall text of Bellarmine is examined,
                  Bellar. l. 4
                     •
                   
                  de notis Ecclesiae cap. 9. §. 8. it is found that M. Morton insteed of the words, sayth he (to wit Bellarmine) should haue sayd S. Hierome and S. Augustine do say so, for that Bellarmine citeth the first part of the wordes of S. Hierome, and the second as the wordes of S. Augustine, which names of authority M. Morton cunningly clipping of, to the end the Reader should not be moued therwith to see the cōmon doctrine of Protestants about Freewill to be accompted Manichean heresie by those two Doctors, he reciteth the sentence as Cardinall Bellarmines owne speach, and not as of the other: and this the first tricke of falsitie in this point.
            24. The second is, that wheras Bellarmine doth accuse Caluin to deny Freewill with the Manicheans, M. Morton obiecteth vnto him a contradiction in this matter, as though he had granted elswhere that Caluin had held the doctrine of Freewill: wherupon he vrgeth Bellarmine in these wordes:
                  Pream. pag. 64. 
               This contradiction in this point is no more then this to charge Caluin with that which he did not belieue: is not this singular falshood? But when the matter is examined it is found that M. Morton endeauoreth

to deceyue his reader with a notable equiuocation about the tyme. For that Bell

Morton heere went about to deceiue his Reader with so grosse an Equiuocation in fact, & practise, the name wherof otherwise in sound of words he doth so eagerly impugne: about which matter see more Chap. 5. num

                  •
                For wheras M. Morton pag. 63 & 64. complayneth that Cardinall Bellarmine doth make Protestants guilty of the heresie of the Nouatiās in taking from the Church all power of reconciling men vnto God (he should haue sayd heresies in the plurall number for that Bella

before in this our answere to haue committed fiue seuerall falshoodes which cannot possibly be excused from witting and wilfull, wherof yow may see more at large, cap. 3. of this our Answere, num. 67.68. &c.
            
            26. But yet there followeth a more notable conuiction of falshood against him for alleadging pag. 84

               & 85. of his Preamble the Iesuit Doctour Azorius,
               About Doctor Azorius. as condemning all vse of Equiuocation, and that by fiue rules: wherof the last is vrged by him, as hitting the naile on the head, to vse his phrase: but when the matter is duely examined, it doth so hit M. Morton on the head, that I take pitty to consider how he reeleth at the blow: for it maketh him to fly and conceale foure rules of the fiue, for that they make wholy against him: As namely the first which resolueth that a Priest may Equiuocate, & say he knoweth nothing, when he is demaunded any thing concerning Confession: the second, that any man may Equiuocate, when he is demaū
               ded by an incompetent iudge, euen with an Oath, wherof he setteth downe 4. or 5. seuerall cases resolued by him, directly against M. Morton in this doctrine. His 3. rule also, which concerneth common conuersation of men, determineth, That whensoeuer any iniury is offred to any man, it is lawful for him to vse Equiuocatiō, eyther in Oath or speach: & by this he resolueth foure other seuerall cases against M. Mor. wherof one is the famous Couentry-Case so oftē by him mētioned. The fourth rule setteth down no particular cases,Ten lyes about Azor. but only giueth direction how we may not vse certaine formes of Equiuocatiō if no iniury be offred vs: & to lyke effect is the fifth rule so much esteemed by M. Morton: but for the former three conteyning the resolution of ten seuerall cases all directly against M. Mort. & his doctrine, being by him both seene & read, & yet concealed and dissembled, do conuince him of ten seuerall witting falshods, and cannot possibly be

excused, for so much as he alledgeth Azor, as denying all Equiuocation, except he will say, that in reading the selfe same pages and lines of Azor his eye sight did not serue him to read the precedent foure rules that resolued so many cases against him, but only opened it selfe vpon the fifth, which were a strange case. Or if he did read them all, then it was a much more strange resolution to suppresse and embezell them, & yet to alledge Azor against his Aduersary with this confident tytle,

            28. As first, for that this is brought in and vrged, as

though Emanuel Sà did affirme, that diuers Catholick Authors did contradict all Equiuocatiō in generall, wheras he expresly speaketh of some particuler cases, that may fallout, wherin the party demaūded though he be not bound to answere: yet hath he not liberty at his own pleasure to equiuocate without necessity, but ought rather to hold his peace, especially when no violence or iniury is offred by the demaunder: which yet not withstāding was auouched to be but a particuler opinion of some, and left afterward by Emanuel himselfe.
            29. Secondly he cutteth of the beginning and ending of his Aduersaries wordes, which do cleerly expound his meaning: and thirdly he doth conceale wittingly fiue particuler cases resolued by Emanuel Sà in fauour of Equiuocation against M. Morton:

Fourthly I do not ioyne Genesius and Sotus togeather in any one place throughout my whole Book.

            31. And now though I grow weary in recapitulating so large & loathsome a list of wilfull vntruthes, as yow haue heard, pretermitting many for auoiding prolixity:About Polidore Virgil falsified. yet cannot I altogeather let passe in this last place one which is very solemne. For wheras M. Morton in the Epistle Dedicatory of this Preamble to to the Earle of Salisbury, had made a solemne protestation, that it should be to him the greatest cryme of all others if it could be proued that he durst to make a lye before his Lordship; & before this againe had affirmed the same in effect to the Kings Grace himselfe in his Epistle dedicatory of his Full satisfaction, assuring his Maiesty of the vprightnes of his conscience, and that he was a Minister of simple truth &c. now notwitstanding both to his Maiesty as also to the Earle, he blusheth not to vtter many lyes togeather, to wit so many as yow haue heard by me conuinced, but two especially in this very

place concerning an obseruation out of Polidore Virgil. For wheras in the sayd dedica

                  ALBEIT from the beginning of this Booke, and especially in our Epistle prefixed before the same, as well Dedicatory to the Vniuersities, as also Admonitory to M. Morton himselfe, we haue made manifest, that the manner of his answering in this his last Preambling defence was nothing els but a certaine florish and outcry of

               CONCERNING M. Mortons owne person, and what new Protestations and Challenges he maketh therabout. §. I.
               HIS first challeng is this:His first charge concerning himselfe. 
                  As for the integrity of my conscience (saith he) I do auow, that if I haue not in the iealousy of my infirmity done that which no one to my knowlege hath done these many ages, to wyt, reuiewed some of mine owne bookes, and examined them not as an Author, but as a Cē
                     surer, discouering such my escapes, as I could at any tyme fynd, and publishing them in print with open animaduersions, to the end that myne owne correction might be my Readers direction: then I say I will con
                        •
                     esse my self worthy of all the criminations of frauds, tricks, deceipts, cosenages, & whatsoeuer opprobrious imputations P. R. either hath, or can fasten vpon me.
               
               5. This is his first protestation:To the 1. protestation. wherunto first I say, concerning his last words, that albeit it were true, that M. Morton had vsed this diligence which here he mentioneth of reuiewing and censuring his owne workes, which yet I neuer saw published,

this doth not so defend him, but that his aduersarie P. R. may iustly fasten vpon him the imputations of falshood, which he pretendeth to do: for so much as he might 
                     •
                  leightly or partially oueruiew his own works, & either out of blindn
                     •
                  sse of selfeloue not see his owne errours (which were hard to belieue, they being so manifest as before hath byn shewed) or rather loath to strike thē out for want of other better matter to supply their place. And howsoeuer it be, P. R. standeth to the auouchment of his imputations, and appealeth to the triall already made: which being apparently true, and in many manyfest pointes not reprouable, M. Mortons reuiew must needs condemne himself, either of lacke of sight, or want of conscience.
               
                   6. Secondly how is it probable, that M. Morton out of the iealousy of his infirmity, as he calleth it, did make so diligent a search and inquiry vpon his works, as here he sayth, for so much as in this very booke of Preamble in the few points that he taketh vpon him to answere, he is forced to confesse for his owne defēce, that sometymes he did not see the Author whom he cyteth, as of

                     . M. which no doubt are fifty for one at least, in regard of this Preamble, and then ensueth this comparison, that M. Morton hauing vttered so many grosse and witting vntruthes in so little a booke, & the Cardinall so few, or rather none at all, that M. Mort. can find and prooue in so many thousand authorities as in his volumes are cyted, it maketh more notable the vanity of this first challeng or brag, that he hath done more in strict examination and censuring of his owne bookes, then any other author for many ages togeather.
               8. Thirdly the reckoning is now made so cleere 
                  
and perspicuous, subductis ex vtraque parte rationibus, by casting the accompts most exactly on both sides, especially by our last three precedent Chapters, to wit, of the fourtene falshoods obiected against him which he chose out to answere but could not: and then by the twice fourteene which he wittingly pretermitted as vnanswerable: and lastly the number of new lyes and falshoods vttered in discharge of the former; the reckoning (I say) is made so euident and palpable, as it must needs cause great laughter to see M. Morton come forth,The penalties wherunto T. M. is alliable
                        •
                      by his owne obligation. and say after all this, That if he haue not in the iealousie of his infirmity so reuiewed and examined his booke, not as an Author but as a Censurer, discouering his owne escapes &c. he will confesse himselfe worthie of all the criminations, fraudes, tricks and deceipts layd against him by his aduersarie: wherin I see no other way can be taken by iustice, but as in suites of obligation when the conditions are not fulfilled, the penalties must be vndergone by the obliged, wherunto by band and obligation he is lyable; that is to say M. Morton must be cō
                  demned of all the imputations before recyted.
               9. Fourthly, to the end it may appeare, that not only I, who am his Country-man, haue obserued this manner of dealing in his treatises written in English but strangers also in such pieces as he hath set forth in the Latin tongue (though I confesse in all truth & sincerity, that I neuer read or saw any thing of his in that tongue) I shall heere set downe the words of a learned stranger, that some daies past wrote a letter out of Germany to a friend of his about two books of M. Mortons confuted by hym, and almost ready to go to the prynt. I know not the very title of the said bookes, but I haue the originall Letter of the writer imparted vnto me by my learned friend, to whome it was written, & I haue shewed the same to sundry others, who will testifie that it is not feigned by me.

By which letter is euident, what stuffe is conteyned in the said two Bookes, and what opinion he hath of the Author. And if I shall vnderstand that any fraud or falshood is suspected on my part in this relation, I shall procure the Answerer to cause this Epistle of his to be printed with the said Answere: his words therefore are these, treating with his friēd of the edition of his said Answere.

Morton chiefely pretendeth to impugne, but so weakely and absurdly, as the said learned man giueth a very contemptible censure of the whole worke, saying:

Which words also for the forsaid cause I leaue vntranslated. And this may suffice for his first chalenge: there followeth the second.
               12. If I haue not earnestly desired (saith he) and by the law of loue challenged of my frends strict iustice, in noting such deprauations as might any way occur:
                  His secōd Challēge. 
                  and (least they should suspect their reprehension to become lesse acceptable vnto me) if I haue not pro

criminations, fraudes, trickes, deceipts, cosenages &c.
               
               13. To which challeng I answere, that if M. Morton haue had this earnest desire indeed, which he speaketh of, and haue requested his friends by the law of loue, to note in strict iustice his d
                     •
                  prauatiōs, as he protesteth, we must needs conclude, that either he hath had few faithfull friends to performe that friendly office vnto him, or that they were very carelesse in their annotations, or he not very prompt to follow their aduertismēts, supposing the multitude of faults that are found, wherof neither he, nor they did take any notice, or seeke to correct them. And as for his willingnes to be reformed by any aduersary,
                  M. Mort. preuaricateth his promises. and that his greatest offence was, and is, not to be in that manner offended, I do not see how it can be true or held for probable: for so much as my selfe being his aduersary in the cause and controuersy betwene vs, hauing sought friendly in my booke of Mitigation to admonish and reforme him in many errours and falsities vttered by him, he hath byn so farre of from taking it in good part, or not being offended therewith, as he hath vtterly lost himselfe through impacience in diuers passages in this his answer, as before you haue heard vpon diuers occasions, & no where will it more appeare, then by the second part of this his challenge concerning his aduersary presently to ensue: wherein he passeth the scolding of any bad woman lightly that euer I haue heard of, if inuectiue scurrility be scolding. Wherfore in this he protesting one thing and doing the contrary, within so few lines, it may easely be seene what credit may be giuen to his wordes. Let vs passe to his third chalenge.
               14. Although I can not (saith he) but choose to be strooke rather of a friend who woundeth,

                     o treacle, his deformation into reformation, then I say, I will confesse my self worthy of all the criminations as before.
               
               15. This Challeng if we consider it well, is only a multiplication of words without new sense or substance,The Answere. for that in the later part of the former Challeng, he protested the same that he doth heere: that he was willing to be re
                     •
                  ormed by any Aduersary, which here he repeateth againe with some more Rhetoricke of phrases, but no more truth. For that I being his Aduersary and reprouing him of so many vntruthes, and offering to stand to the triall, as now I haue done, he hath not only not taken it patiently nor turned venome into treacle, but quite contrariwise treacle into venome: for that my admonitions were treacle indeed to resist the venome of a lying spirit infused by heresy, if he would haue taken the benefit thereof. And as for the Antidote, which here he speaketh of to be reprehended friendly, least he might be reprehensible; if it be so much to be estemed as he saith (& so it is indeed) then much more obligation is there to be patient in receauing reprehension, where a man is actually reprehensible indeed, and that in so high a degree as I do pretend and proue that M. Morton is, by his false dealing before laid downe, which yet he holding for toxicum, I haue very litle hope though much desyre, that it may do him good: but to others I trust it will, that are not so partially and passionatly interessed in the matter.
               16. His fourth Challeng is vttered in these words: If in my ordinary course of life (saith he) any man can charge me with a bent to this vice of 
                        •
                     alsity, though it were for hope of whatsoeuer aduātage &c. then I will confesse my selfe worthy &c.
                  His fourth Chalēge. Vnto

which Challenge, if so he will needs call it (for I neuer saw Challenges runne in this forme) I haue this only to answere,The Answere. that the falsifications obiected are extant à parte rei, and auouched out of his Bookes published in his name: and whether he wrote the same either of a bent to this vice, or of a back, that is to say, of a necessity or kind of compulsion for manteyning of a bad cause, I will not stand to dispute or determine. Neither will I alleage any thing iniuriously against M. Mortons person, which I do loue from my hart in the true loue of Christ our Sauiour, wishing his best spirituall good as myne owne, and do esteme him also for the good partes that God hath bestowed vpon him, though I do pitty the euill imployment thereof, in the cause he defendeth. And this shalbe sufficient concerning his chalenges & protestatiōs about his owne persō. Now to the person of P. R. his Aduersary.
            
            
               CONCERNING the person of his Aduersary P. R. and absurd Challenges made against him. §. II.
               IF in any other place of his whole Booke (which yet are many, as you haue seene, by the perusall therof, and of my answere) M. Morton forgot himself, or rather lost himself by vehemency of passion, grief and choller, he seemeth principally to haue done it in this place, where he cēsureth his aduersary in foure seueral challēges, which I haue thought best to set downe together, & not to answere thē seuerally, as I did in the fo

                     olute,  as if P. R. might be worthily interpreted Praeuaricator Rasus. If not in his criminations and obiections of falsifications  so vnconscionably and impudently vniust, as if P. R. naght certaynly deserue the interpretation of Perfidiae Reus &c. then  will I assume all his odious attributes, as proper vnto my self &c. So M. Morton.
               
               19. And doth not the discrete Reader see by these manner of Challenges,The Answere. that the man hath more need of compassion & commiseration from me then confutation? Truly I cannot thinke so ill of his nature or condition, that he would haue fallen into this ridiculous distemperature of words, but vpon some great straites and extremities of mynd. For first what Grammer scholler is there, that hath neuer so small measure of a malicious wit, that cannot inuent twē
                  ty of these opprobrious termes and combinations vpon any two letters, that shalbe giuen him to that purpose? And do you not thinke that the letters T. M. may receyue in like manner variety of such allusions? at least wise the interpretation of T. M. Thomas M

                     uted. could not faile to offer it self to euery mans cogitation that had read the multitude of witting and wilfull vntruthes conuinced by me against him before. Wherefore this inuention of reuēge was a very poore and feeble one.
               20. Secondly these opprobrious interpretations vsed heere by M. Morton haue not only any truth, sap, salte, or acumen in them, but neither any meane conueniency or congruity with the things wherunto

they are applied. As in the first, in regard of despitefully malignant tearmes, he will haue P. R. to signify Princeps Rabularum,
                  Princepa Rabularum. as though Rabula did signify a railer which is more I thinke then either his dictionary or Lexicon will allow, though it import a more intē
                  perate kind of action or defence then M. Morton can with any shadow of truth iustly ascribe to his aduersary P. R. in this respect.
               21. Phormio Romanista in lyke manner is very vnfitly applied;Phormio Romanista. for whether he will allude to Phormio Captayne of the Athenians; or to Phormio the Philosopher in Hannibals time, or to Phormio the parasite in Terence, I do not see how the said allusion may agree with any correspondence to the thing heere obiected of doting vanity and ostentation of wit & learning. For flattery is rather of other men, then of our selues.
               22. But most impertinent is Praeuaricator Rasus in the third Chaleng ascribed to dis
                     •
                  olute defence of his owne cause:Praeuaricator Rasus. wheras a Preuaricator is he that colludeth with his aduersary-Attorney to betraie the cause, for which he will seeme to plead. And whether I haue done so, and haue betraied myne owne cause, giuing the victory and conquest to M. Morton, vnder pretēce to impugne him, let the Reader be Iudge that hath seene both our pleadings: only I must say that my will was not to doe it. And as for the word Rasus, it was put in and ioyned to Praeuaricator, without sense or salt, as the prouerbe is. For what can it impor
                     •
                   either to be shauen or be long-bearded, to vse collusion in treating of a cause? Wherfore this only came in to correspond with the letter, & from some good esteeme perhaps that M. Morton holdeth of his owne beard, with contempt of vs, for that some among vs doe vse somtimes to cut or shaue our beards: which custome notwithstanding he cannot deny to

haue byn in vse in the ancient Christian Church, & held for Religious for many ages past.

                   is the glory of such Yonkers to scoffe at their elders,

and to frame to themselues conquest and Victories vpon their contumelies. But let vs make an end of this wise censuring of his Aduersary.
               25. His fourth and last contumely of Perfidiae Reus,
                  Perfidiae Reus. guilty of perfidy, is so deuoid of all faith and tru

                  h, as the guylt of perfidy, if any be, must needs fall vpō the vnfaithfulnes and infidelity of the accuser, that raileth so bitterly without all ground or substance. For what one thing hath he proued before of perfidious dealing in me, who do cyt

                  The vpshot of the Reckoning. I do so establish my accompts against hym, as there seemeth scarse any place to remaine for any probable defence on his part: Yf there be, let vs haue it, the Booke is extant, the Chapters are set downe, the places are quoted, the words are recited, the arguments and all

                  gations are examintd on both sides, not one wilfull falsity hath byn able to be proued against P. R. or any one Catholicke wryter that could be picked out for that purpose; but many, and manifest, grosse, witting, and wilfull haue bin proued and defended and conuinced against M.

I am content to remit my selfe to the Iudgement of any two ciuill learned men of either of the Vniuersities, to giue sentence in this behalfe, though neuer so alienated from vs in opinion of Religion. And thus much of the men. Now of the matter, booke, and cause it selfe

               CONCERNING his Booke and Cause it selfe, foure other of M. Mortons Challenges. §. III.
               IN the last place M. Morton maketh new Challenges about the Cause and matter it self, wherin he threatneth great things to be performed by him; & that vpon great and seuere penalties if he achieue not all that is put downe in his Challenges, to wit: That his Treatises be purged with fire, and himselfe forced to recantation. Which conditions if his Aduersary should accept, I doubt not but he would quickly find himselfe in inextricable brakes, if we may frame a Iudgment of things to come, by things past: and of his prowesse what he can doe, by that which he hath done in time of most necessity. For if euer he could do much, it was time to do it now, and shew his valour when he was most pressed, as you see he hath byn in these precedent Chapters, wherin he found himselfe ouerloaden with multiplicity of apparent witting and inexcusable vntruthes, so fastned vpon him, and so earnestly exacted, as all his credit, honour and honesty lay vpon it to defend himselfe or giue satisfaction. Which not being able to do but by pretermitting wholy the most and chiefe points, and falling downe vnder the burthen of the other; we may imagine what he will be able to do for the time to come,T. M. a cock of the game. especially seing that he is so recharged with new Charges in the last precedent Chapter, as if before he shrunke vnder the burthen, he must needs now both sinke & fall downe. And yet let vs heare him crow once more at this very last cast, like a

battered Cocke of the game beaten out of the Cockpit, as before we haue likened him vnto.
               27. Lastly (saith he) for the cause,

Morton, that bargaine, promise, or leesse he what he will, there wilbe no execution made against him, and therfore he may be as liberal as he list in offering large conditions. But let vs examine in a word or two the particulers.

For that I hauing set downe my Reasons for the sayd mentall Reseruation out of Scriptures, Fathers, doctors, Scholemen, exāples and other proofs for aboue two hundreth and fifty pages together, M. Morton hath not found out any one instance wherof to treate in this his Reply, or to fasten his pen vpon the same, but only the Equiuocatiō of the poore woman Saphyra in the Actes of the Apostles, which yet I told him before was no Equiuocation, but a flat lye, as commonly his and his fellowes Equiuocations are, wherof I haue giuen many examples in the last Chapter of my Treatise of Mitigation, both in himselfe, and his antecessours, M. Iewell, M. Horne, M. Fox, Hanmer, Charke, Perkins, Syr Francis Hastings, Syr Edward Cooke, and some others: whereof M. Morton thought not best to take vpon him the defence of any one in this his last Reply, but by silence rather to condemne them all, and consequently heere were no apples of Sodome to be found that vanish at the first touch, but all are dusands and hard wardens that will weary his fingers to bruze them, if I may trifle with him a litle in following his owne comparison of apples.

whether the same where tollerable or excusable or not? And for that it seemed he had some right to vrge me in this matter, in respect of the Treati

               n to vrge one of his parishioners to pay him other tithes also out of a certayne closse or field, that was pretended not to haue payed tithes before to other precedent Incumbents. Wherupon this Minister deuising with himself, how he might further his owne cause, resolued vpon this meane among others, to deale with another Mininister, which immediately before had possessed that benefice, intreating him aswell by request, as by offering him a peece of money (as hither is written) to assist him in this behalf, by lending him the ayd of an oath, that he had receaued tythes before that time out of that closse or field. Wherat though for a tyme the second-Minister did seem t

                seemeth by the earnest persuasion and inductions of the other Minister, his repugnance of conscience was so mortifyed, as he yealded to the others intreaty; especially, for that he told him, 
                  •
               hat he had so great friendship and acquaintance with those, that must be iudges and examiners of the cause in Yorke, as he doubted not, but that their two oathes would carrie it away.
            
               3. To Yorke Assises then they went, where hauing taken their oathes, and pleaded the case, at length they found not that successe, which they expected: For that the whole towne and parish of Thornley offering themselues confidently to sweare & depose the contrary in behalf of the defendant (to wit, that tythes were not accustomed to be payd out of that place) the Ministers had sentence giuen against them, with no small note of publike periury. Whereof one that was a particuler friend of M. VVh. demaunding the reason, how they could sweare or rather softweare in such manner, the thing being knowne to be so notoriously false? He answered, that they in their owne sense did sweare truly (behold then the case of Equiuocation) & that so they were ready to prooue it, if they had bene vrged by the Iudges therin,A fraudulent and lying Equiuocation. to wit, that their meaning in swearing was
                  •
                that the former Incumbent had receaued tythes out of that closse or field, or without that closse or field, namly, in other closses adioyning, though not in the field. And with this Equiuocation of (out) and (in) they thought themselues cleared, both for deceyuing the Iudges, and their parishioners. Now then to the resolution of the case.
            4. And first of all by this we see, how these good fellowes that do cry out so hideously, and reuell euery where both in bookes, sermons and cōmon speach

               gainst the moderate & lawfull vse of Equiuocation in iust and necessary causes, and for iust and lawfull ends, without hurt of any, doe notwithstanding vse and practise themselues the same with contrary vnlawfull circumstances, wicked ends & purposes. For that heere

               hese two Ministers end was their owne interest, and hurtfully to deceyue their neighbour and parishioners. Their cōspiracy togeather by way of money, corruption, and bribes, was detestable.

Their guilefull deceiuing their lawfull Iudges, that were competent in the cause, & proceeded iuridically, was abhominable. The scandall giuen to them that knew they sware falsely, was impious. The obligatiō they had to answere directly vnto the sense and meaning of the said Iudges,The resolution of the case. was indispensable: all which points are different in a lawfull Equiuocation. Wherof I do inferre, for resolution of the case, that this was no true or proper Equiuocation at all, but rather a flat lie, and open periury, as by that we haue treated before with M. Morton in the s

            5. And heere now I would end with this alone, were it not that a new peart-Brother-Minister of M Mortons is come forth of late with a new printed Sermon, wherein he taketh occasion after the imitation of M. Mortons veyne, to rayle excedingly against all Equiuocation whatsoeuer, without exception, & to inueigh most impotently against Iesuits for defē
               ce and practise therof, as though they were the only and principall men, that did either allow or vse the same. Which is so shamlesse an assertion after he hath seene what I haue written in my sayd booke of Mitigation, concerning the multitude of learned authors that for many ages haue taught the same doctrine in publike schooles, before Iesuits were heard of in the world, as this latter Minister can neuer defend or excuse so manifest an vntruth about Equiuocatiō, but by Equiuocation; feigning to himselfe some such absurd reseruation in mind as his foresaid brethren the

When would either M. Southwell or M Garnet, whome they are wont to accuse for this doctrine, haue taken such an oath, for deceauing their neighbour as those Ministers did? Was this out of the infirmity of the flesh and pusillanimity, or rather out of couetousnes and iniquity? Was it with the faces of Hierusalē
                and Iuda, or not rather of Sodome and Gomorrah? Nay I would aske of this new Gamester, that is so exorbitant in his outcryes, with what face he cā auouch so many manifest vntruthes in this idle inuectiue of his, that cannot be excused from flat lyes,

Wherto I answer, that the prisons filled, the mulcts imposed, the confiscation exercised, the bowels of them that were quartered, the heads of them that were beheaded, may suffice to satisfy this idle question

of the Minister, especially and aboue all, the royall and sacred Head of his Maiesties Mother, most iniuriously against all law of nature & nations, cut of, and so many continuall toyles giuen by the said pretended Saint to the kingdome of Scotland,

These things, I say, do easely answere the flattering Ministers demand of, Gratious meeke Lady, what hath she euer done?
            8. And as for the other part, whose finger did she euer cause to ake, and her hart aked not with him, is too to childish and ridiculous; & no man can read or heare it, but with derision and laughter, her hart being knowne to haue bene of other mettall, then to ake for other mens fingers. For to pretermit these particuler afflictiōs layd vpon particuler people, whome now I haue mentioned, without compassion or aking of her hart, who doth not know, that when all Countries round about her, France, Flanders, Holland Zeland, Scotland, Ireland, and some other states, were all in warre and combustion, killing and destroyng one another, about quarrels of Religion, principally set one foot and mainteyned by herselfe, she passed her dayes in England in mirth & ioy, as all Courtiers of that tyme will remember: nor did so much as her finger ake for their harts aking,Q. Elizabeth made others harts to ake, when her owne aked not. for any thing that euer I heard of to the contrary. How then can this be excused without some shift of Equiuocall meaning in this false Minister, saying one thing, & meaning another? For that in no sincerity of conscience can he possibly thinke it to be true. This is then one example, let vs see another.
            9. He writeth of the Iesuits thus in the same

place: That their whole order, institute, and practice are such, as they say in effect vnto Christ, as the Diuels did,
               
                  Pag. 26. 
               Quid nobis & tibi est Iesu? VVhat haue we to doe with thee ô Iesu? This sentence being vttered in such an auditory, as that was, wherin his Maiesty was present, and much of the Nobility of the land, & so many learned hearers besides, must needes presuppose, as to me it seemeth, that the vtterer had perused well the Iesuits institute,An exaggeration about the Iesuites institute. and had conferred the same exactly, as also their life and practice with the law and life of Iesus, and had found therin this extreame opposition and contradiction between Iesus and Iesuites, no lesse then between him, and the Diuels themselues. But then me thought on the other side if this had beene so, he should haue alleaged some particulers at least: wherin this contradiction did stand: and it had bene perhaps no vnfit argument to be handled in that so great an assembly for discrediting that sort of people, throughout the world: and tho

                it self) as of obstinate wilfull peruicacity in defending an absurd cauillation, which once they haue taken in hand to prosecute by right or wrong. And so you haue seen
                  •
                that the last named Minister King; though a very trifler, and not able to answere any one of the arguments, reasons, Scriptures, Fathers, examples and other anthorities alleaged for the lawfulnesse of

Equiuocation in the booke of Mitigation, or at least wise did attempt to answer none (wherin notwithstanding he should haue yealded great assistance to M. Morton,
               The Ministers agree to raile togeather. that durst vndertake the answere of no one) yet doth he fall in iumpe with him in raging and rayling against the same: though if a man might come to deale calmely with them hand to hand, & enter into a quiet and sober Reckoning about the matter, as we haue donne before with M. Morton, I doubt not, but that they would be forced to reason, euen by common sense and experience it self, and therby see their owne egregious folly. For I would demaund them in good earnest, what they thinke of the better and wiser sort of men, not only of our religion, but of theirs also, who make a conscience to lie, for that they hold it for a damnable sinne, & yet would be loath to vtter matters of secr

What would the say? What cuasion would they find to free themselues from these inconueniences? For if they vttered simple truth
                  •
                they should breake secrecy: if they denied the same 
                  •
               latly without Equiuocation, they should lie: if they refused to answere, they should both offend the person, whome they would not, & oftentymes thereby confesse that

which they would conceale. For that to say, I will not tell you, besids the offence, inferreth oftentimes a secret confession of that, which he denieth to tell. VVherefore who seeth not, but that commonly the refuge must be to Equiuocation, that is to say, to vtter so much as in their sense is true, though the hearer mistake it in another sense, and thereby the secrecie of the thing it self is conserued.
            15. And is not this an ordinary practise euen amongst the best men of what religiō soeuer, and such as most of all do detest lying? And how then do our Ministers so raue against it? Nay can the cōmon cō
               uersatiō of humane life be without it, where lying is auoyded? Let vs imagine that there were a man both learned, prudent & godly, & adorned with all gifts belonging to a wise and good man, but yet were of our Ministers opinion, neuer to conceale any thing by Equiuocation, and further then this had also a resolution more then our Ministers haue, to wit, not to lie at all for any respect whatsoeuer, out of which two determinations it must needs follow, that he would simply deny or confesse whatsoeuer should be demaunded of him: would any mā euer commit matters of coūsell or secrecy vnto him? Or were he a man tractable or conuersable in a common-wealth? or fit to mānage any matter of importance, though otherwise neuer so learned, neuer so prudent, neuer so good, neuer so godly? I think no. Heere then the absurdity or rather senselesse stupidity of our Ministers continuall clamours and outcries against vs for the moderate vse of this Equiuocation in lawfull occasions, is euidently discouered & reiected.

               See the examples of Equiuocation in holy men throughout the 9. Chapter of my Treatise therof. deuided into foure parts, & all hādling this only matter o
                  •
                exāples of Equiuocall speach vsed by the best mē: yet must I needs say, that hauing considered since that time, & made some more particuler reflection vpon diuers passages of the new Testament & speaches of our Sauiour, I find them so frequent euery where in this manner of concealing secrecyes, or things not fit to be playnly vttered, by this doubtfull and ambiguous kinde of speach, as in one only Chapter of S. Iohns ghospell I finde Christ to haue vsed the same aboue 7.Ioan. 8. or 8. times at least, setting downe certaine propositions, that of themselues, and as they lie, are in the common hearers eare false, though true in the speakers meaning by some mentall reseruation: which reseruation though he vttered not in words, yet is it necessarily vnderstood: and this is properly Equiuocation in our sense & doctrine. And if our Kingly Minister in the heat of his exaggeration will call these also mungrill and heterogenious propositions, or M. Morton, out of his modesty, will tearme them, monstrous, and impious illusions of the black-art, they would in these countries be punished both of them for blasphemy, though at home among their friends I know not how fauorably the censure might passe vpon thē: but of lesse then fond impiety I thinke no man of iudgment and discretion will, or can condemne thē.
            
               17. The place then which I meane is the 8. Chapter of S. Iohns Ghospel, where Christ our Sauiour entring into a large speach with the Iewes, vseth  first these words, which I haue examined before in my said Treatise of Equiuocation:
               Sundry Equiuocations in our Blessed Sauiours speach. 
               Ego non iudico quemquam, I do not iudge any man: which seeming to be contrary to that other saying of himself, within a very few lines in the same Chapter: I haue many things to speake and iudge of you: and further in the same Ghospell three Chapters before: For neither doth my Father iudge any man, but hath giuen to me his Sonne all iudgment: it doth not appeare how the proposition can be true but by some mentall reseruation in the mind of our Sauiour; which being examined by the ancient Fathers, what it might be, S. Chrysost. with Leontius Theophilus, and others, do thinke the sayd secret meaning or reseruation of our Sauiour to haue bene this: I do not iudge any mā in this my first cōming, but do reserue it for my next, at the day of iudgment. Other Fathers gather another, as though he had secretly meant: I do not iudge any man, as you the Scribes and Pharisies do, according to the flesh and outward shew, but in truth: yet neither of these reseruatiōs being vttered, they do make the speach to be ambiguous and Equiuocall, as cannot be denyed.
            18. In the same place he saith to the Iewes: Yf you perseuere in my sayings, you shall truly be my disciples, and  know the truth, and the truth shall free you: which freedome or deliuerance the Iewes vnderstood from tē
               porall bondage
                  •
                and therefore answered him, that they were the seed of Abraham, and had neuer bene in bondage to any: which errour of the Iewes proceeded from the ambiguous speach of our Sauiour, reseruing in his mind, and not expressing in his proposition, what bondage he meant: for that his reserued meaning indeed was of the bondage of sinne.
            
               
                19. The like may be obserued in those words: Ego non quaero gloriam meam:
                  Versu 5. I do not seeke my glory: & yet doth Christ most iustly seeke his owne glory that is due vnto him, and punisheth them that giue it not vnto him: and so in the verse immediatly before he obiecteth this vnto them, Vos inhonorastis me: you haue dishonored me: and in another place to his disciples he saith,
                  Ioan. 13. v. 13. 
               Vos vocatis me Magister & Domine, & bene dicitis, sum etenim. You call me Maister and Lord, and do well therein, for that I am your Maister & Lord indeed.
                  Ioan. 14. v. 1. And in another place, Creditis in Deum, & in me credite. You do belieue in God, belieue also in me, which is the highest honour, that he could exact: and consequently there must needs be some mentall reseruation in this other speach, when he saith, that he seeketh not his owne glory, which the Fathres do indeauour to seeke out in their Commentaries.
            20. It followeth in the 
                  •
               ame place: Amen, Amen, I say vnto you, if any obserue my words, he shall neuer see death.
               
                  vers. 51. 
                Which the Scribes and Pharisies (though otherwise learned in their law) vnderstood of corporall death; and in that sense gaue an instance of Abraham and the Prophets that were dead, notwithstanding they had obserued the words and commaundements of God; and consequently in their sense Christs sentence could not be true: but our Sauiour had another intention and meaning reserued in his mind, by which reseruation the truth of the sentence was iustified: to wit, that they should not die in soule.
            
                21. It followeth yet further in the same place: If I do glorify my self (saith Christ) my glory is nothing:
                  vers. 54. which yet I think no man will grant to be true according to the letter, and as it lieth. For albeit Christ should 
                  •
               et forth his owne glory, yet may it not be said, that this glory so published by himself, is nothing

or vaine. VVherefore some reserued sense must heere also be sought out; which according to the opinion of sundry expositours is, that he meant this according to the opinion of the Iewes, who esteemed that  for nothing, which came from Christ himself.
                  Cap. 5. v
                        •
                     
                   31. As also a little before in the fifth Chapter, he vsed the like speach saying; If I beare witnesse of my self, my witnesse is not true. VVhich sentence I thinke our Ministers thēselues will not hold to be true in the sense which here it beareth: for then should they condemne our Sauiour of falfity, as often as he affirmeth any thing of himself: and then must we of necessity runne to 
                  •
               ome reserued sense in Christs meaning, which is the thing that we call Equiuocation, so reuiled by our Ministers.
            22. Furthermore in the very next verse, talking  of almighty God, he sayd to the Iewes:
                  vers. 55. 
               Non cognouistis eum: you do not know him: which semeth vntrue in it self, for that the Iewes did professe to know him, and serue him aboue all people in the world. And in the old Testamēt it is often said of them, that they of all other people did best know God: and therefore some other reserued meaning must Christ our Sauiour needs haue had, then these externall words do insinuate: which reseruation S. Chrysostome, S. Augustine, S. Bede, and Theophilact vpon this place do thinke to haue bene this in Christ his s
                  •
               cret meaning, that they did not know God, as they ought to know him, by seruing him, as he would and ought to be serued, according to the speach of S. Paul to Titus:
               
                  Tit. 1. v
                        •
                     
                   16. 
               Confitentur se nosse Deum, factis autem negant. They confesse to know God in words, but do deny him in deedes. So as here also an Equiuocation of speach was vsed by our Sauiour.
            23. Againe in the ensuing verse, which is the  56. Christ said to the Iewes:
                  vers. 56
                     •

Which wordes in the common sense do seeme to import, that Abraham had liued with Christ, and had seene the day of his birth and life, and taken great ioy therby: and so did the Iewes vnderstand his meaning to be, not only the common people, but the Scribes & Pharisies also, when they sayd vnto him: thou hast not yet fifty yeares of age, and hast thou seene Abraham? wherin notwithstanding they were greatly deceiued, for that Christ our Sauiour had another reserued meaning in his mind, which the holy Fathers do labour greatly to expound vnto vs, what it was: and in what true sense our Sauiour sayd that Abraham had seene his day: whose different opiniōs, reasons and coniectures I will not stād to relate here; It is sufficiēt for me to haue shewed, that this was an Equiuocall speach of our Sauiour, whereby the hearers being deceaued, the truth of the speach may only be defended by a reseruation in mind of the speaker.
            24. And finally in the next verse after this againe  Christ vseth a greater Equiuocation, then any before, saying vnto them: Amen, Amen, dico vobis, antequam Abraham fieret, ego sum. Amen, Amen, I say vnto you, that before Abraham was made, I am: which being an earnest speach, and as it were an oath, as elsewhere we haue noted, the Iewes vnderstood it, as it lieth, that Christ our Sauiour was borne in flesh before Abraham: and so it seemeth that he should haue meant according to his former speach, when he said, that Abraham desired to see his day, and saw it, and reioyced thereat: which was vnderstood of his incarnation or day in flesh, which Abraham in faith & spirit did see and reioyce. But yet heere when he saith that he is before Abraham was made, he must needs meane of his Diuinity, and in that he was God: which S. Augustine vpon this place doth excellently

note to be so by the differēce of the two words, Abrahā fieret, & ego sum, the one belonging to the creature, saith he, the other to the creatour. So as more then one Equiuocation is vsed by our Sauiour in this one sentence: and if we lay all these Equiuocall speaches togeather, which are 8. or 9. at least conteyned within a piece of one only Chapter of our Sauiours talke with the Iewes, Scribes and Pharisies, we shalbe able to make some ghesse, how many might be found throughout the whole new Testament and Bible, if we would examin the same particulerly, as we haue donne this: and thereby see how true M. Mortons bold assertion was in his booke of full Satisfaction, that no one iota in all Scripture,
               
                  pag. 49. 
               no one example in all Catholike antiquity could be 
                     •
                  ound for the same: His tearmes also of, heathenish, hellish, heynous and impious Equiuocation,
               
                  Ibidem.
                with other infamations of his brother-Minister King, may appeare what substantiall ground they haue.
            25. For heere except they will condemne our Sauiour himselfe of all these obiected impieties, they cannot condemne the manner of speach vsed by him, especially in so graue and weighty matters: and if they permit the same in him, then can they not cō
               demne it in vs, who haue so good a warrant & president for the same, especially seing we do restrayne our vse thereof with many limitations, as in our larger Treatise of that matter is set downe, to wit, that it may not be vsed in matters of religion, where cō
               fession of our faith is required, nor yet in common trafficke, and conuersation of humane life, where any may be preiudiced or damnified therby: neither to any Iudge or lawfull Magistrate, that proceedeth lawfully, and hath iust authority to demaund vs, and we obligation to answer him to his meaning. And finally except some iniury or preiudice be offered vs (for auoiding wherof it is conuenient to vse the refuge

of this manner of speach) and except our speach be all waies true in our owne lawfull meaning, we are not permitted by Catholicke doctrine to vse the same, and much lesse with open lying, as the two Ministers before alleaged, and many of their fellowes are shewed to haue donne. And this I thinke is so much as needeth to be treated of this matter at the present, by occasion of this Appendix.
