So in lyke wiſe is it of almighty god. For not withſtandinge he hathe loued his children with ſo brennynge loue. That for theym he had wyll to dye / when the day of Iugement ſhall cōme he ſhall condempne theim

in to euerlaſtinge fyre yf he fynde in theym one only mortall ſynne / And thou pore ſynfull ſoule then for ſo moche that thou ſeeſt & vnderſtandeth howe moche almighty god hateth / and hath abhomynacion of ſynne: if thou wyll pleaſe hym: thou oughteſt before all thy workis flee and withſtande alle ſynne / And gyue hym in the noo place / ne habitacyon. For thou well knoweſt that the wife ſholde be right vntrewe that wold ley in her bed a mā that ſhulde purſue the deth of her houſbounde / wherby many euyllis might cōme to hym. Nowe is it ſoo then that ſynne is the thinge that our lorde Ihū caſte the true ſpowſe of ſoules whiche he hath ſo moche willed to loue that by their contynuaūce of ſyn many euillis hathe hapened them / and fynably the dethe / And therfore right dere frende thinke of thy ſaluacion / & flee ſynne / and herken the monicion of Dauid the prophete the whiche ſaith ī this maner O my almyghty god I pray the yeue me a fyrme / pure / and clene harte / And that it liſteth to renewe my inwarde ꝑties / with thy holy and ſacrid ſpirite. ¶Secoundely thou ought ſouerainly & wyth all diligence flee ſynne / principally deedly ſynne for that is the thinge that moſt pleaſeth & reioiſith our gooſtely enmye the deuyll / as thou maiſt know by thre ſignes / ¶The firſte is that the fende aſkethe noon other diſporte or wynnynge but only the ſoules. wherfore it is written ī the .xl. chapitour of geneſie that the deuyll ſpake to god: ſaiyng to hym in this maner / gyue me the ſoules of thy creatures / &

all the remnaunt kepe to thy ſelfe. And ſaint Gregory ſaith / that the deuyll eſtemyth or Iugꝭ no thinge doon that pleaſithe hym: yf it hurte not the ſoule. with the darte of deadly ſynne / For he doth as the birde for his praye. He ſercheth nor aſkith noon other thinge for his refeccion but the harte / In lykewiſe the deuyl aſketh of man no thinge but the ſoule / The ſecounde thinge is that the deuyl aboue all deſireth and loues ſynne / For his cōtynuall temptacion / For in cōmyttyng of ſynne / he was neuer wery ne ouer traueled. For he hath ben purchaſynge ſynne by the ſpace of .vi. M. yere & more / and neuer was wery nor fatigate / but alwaye ſercheth & enquireth the new maner to make the creatur to cō
               mytte ſyn̄e. For as it is writtē in the firſt chapitur of Iobe that when almighty god aſked of the deuill from whens he cōme he anſwered that he had circuyed all therth / The whiche is a ſigne he occupyed alway to moue ſynne / & neuer can take reſt / & for this cauſe is the auctorite folowyng taken ī the boke of Iobe ī the .iii. chapitour ſaiyng in this maner / they yt deuoure me ſlepith not. The thirde ſigne wherby it may be knowen that the fēde is ſouerainly pleaſed wt ſyn̄e For ſo moche he was neuer ſatiſfied wt ſyn̄e / not withſtāding yt he hath by ſinne deuored infinite thouſandꝭ of men / & yet is he alwaies hūgry as the ragious lion euer ſechīg how he may deuoure moo / And as ſaint Peter ſaithe he is not only hungry of mete but with yt he thurſtith for drynke / wherof ſaith Iobe the flode is horrible

and the deuyll merueleth not therof / for he hathe truſt that the flode of Iordane ſhall entre in to his throte that is to ſay in to hell / and the flode that the deuell ſo ſwaloeth without meruelinge is the ſynnes cōmynge day / and night in to the ſwallowinge of hell / the whiche he deſireth ſouerainly to deuour / And more clerly to proue that the deuyll takith in ſyn̄e his dilectacion we haue an example in the lyf of faders / in the chapitour of deuylles. how one of theym a monge other was prayſed and honored of his prynce of deuyllꝭ / & was ſet ī a chayre bifore all other / in ſigne of victorie Bicauſe that he had led / & brought to the ſynne of fornicacion a mō
               ke / the whiche by the ſpace of .lxiii. yere before he myght not drawe to ſynne / Nowe therfore ſynful ſoule wepe bitterly / as longe as thou haſt reioyced againſt the? thy enmies. That is to knowe the fendis / whom thou haſt reioyced / as many tymes as thou haſt mortally ſynned / And for the tyme to come? order the by pure confeſſion / & worthy ſatiſfaccion? to make thy lorde god Ioye in the / with all his aungellis. for as ſaith ſaint Luke in his xv. chapitour / the aungellꝭ of heuē reioyces theym. when a ſynner is conuerted and dothe penaūce / Thrydely thou oughteſt ſtudiouſly to flee & withſtand ſynne / for it annoyeth the / & is more cōtrary to the then any other thynge / in ſomoche that by ſynne we beparted frome the loue of god / & be made his enmyes. as ſaith the prophete Iſaye in his .xix chapitour Oure iniquities hath put deuiſion bitwene god &

vs / And our ſynnes hath withdrawen his face frome vs / that is to ſay frome our viſion. For there is noon in paradiſe ſo iuſte nor ſo holy? if he cōmytted ſynne? but a noon he ſhulde fall in to he. and leſe the loue of god / to the whiche purpoſe ſaithe ſaint Auguſtyne / he that cōmytteth faulte or ſynne agaynſt his true and moſte true frende? ought to be reputed greatly reprouable Nowe then it behoueth the to knowe and vnderſtond that by a more ſtronge reaſon he that cōmyteth faulte or ſynne againſt the ſouerayn & debonayre all mighty god? ought well to be reputed and of al holden abhomynable. Four thely it is to knowe that by ſynne the ſynner is Iuged to the Iebet of hell / & for ſo moche as the lawe of god is not farre different fro the lawe of man? Therfore in lyke maner al the brekers of the lawe of man? whiche dothe treſpace againſte the kingis Royall mageſtie? be worthy to deth / and ought to be punyſſhed corporally. So in ſembliable wyſe the pore and miſerable ſynners: whiche haue offended not oonly the temporall prince: but to the heuē
               ly kinge: ought well to be condempned & to be hanged in hell perpetually / as it is written in the boke of Eſdras the .xiiii. chapitour / And in lyke wyſe in decre of daryous / in the whiche he ſaith thus / it oughte to be ſhewed that who ſo euer trangreſſeth & breketh the lawe yeuen & written as touchyng the ſynne of cōmyſſion: or ellis diſpiſes it: as touchinge the ſynne of omyſſion: they ought to take of the propre wode that is to ſay of the gardeyn of their propre

conſcience / for in the conſciens growyth a tree wheron the ſynner is hanged / and his gode dedes be forfeated and aſcribed / For by cauſe he hathe offended and diſpiſed the lawe of his prince. ¶Alſo in lyke wyſe the punyſſhemente of ſynnes in wicked creatures: retourneth to the glory of the heuenly kinge as the rewarde of glorie is Ioyfull to hym: of theym that be gode. So mayſte thou ſe that the lawe of mā doth bodely / & the lawe of god doth ſpiritually / & that ſame almoſt is redde in the .vii. Chapitour of heſter / where it is ſaid / take a mā and hange hym on the Iebet / by a man is vnderſtande a ſynner whiche the heuenly kinge ſhall cō
               maunde to be hanged on the Iebet of hell / if he fynde hym in mortall ſynne / Fyftely ſynne diſpoylethe man in this worlde from all goodneſſe and grace And in the other worlde frome eternall Ioy / ſo as it is written in the .xiiii. chapitour of ꝓuerbes / ſynne / maketh man pore and miſerable / for truely the ſynner ought well to be called pore whan he hath no thinge but hath loſt him ſelf by dedly ſynne / and frome fredome is entred in to the ſeruytute of the deuyll / yet ought the ſynner to be called more pore / for he may no thinge wyne beynge in ſuche aſtate / nor may do any workes meritorious or agreable to god / & finably / may be called right pore / for noon may yeue to hym any thīg yt gode is / for it ſhal profite hym noo thinge to the helthe of ſoule / for he hathe no lyfe but only in the body / the ſoule is as ded. wherof Boice ſaith in his .iiii. boke of conſolacion / 

an euyll man is noon other wyſe to be called but a dede man. For man by ſynne is departed from the lyght of god / & derkely blyndide. For as it is written in the ſophologie in the firſte chapitour / They ſhall walke as blynde / that haue ſynned agaynſte god. And as the pſalmyſte ſaith / they haue not knowen ne ſene the waye of their helth / And therfore they walke in derkenes / to this purpoſe ſaith ſaint Ierome / The ſoule polluted by ſynne? is depryued and beaten downe / to thende that he is not worthy or hathe power to beholde on highe / And it is to be knowen that ſynne is as the rotenneſſe in an apple / for as the putrifaccion taketh frome the apple the coloure and odoure? So dothe ſynne take frome man the odour of good renowne / & of Ioy? the colloure and beaute / with the ſauour of grace wherfore ſynne of good right? well may be called rotenneſſe / of the whiche ſpeketh Iſaye in his .xv. chapitour / ſaiynge / he that doth ſynne ledeth a more foule life? then is the myere or any rotennes of therth. And ſaint Auguſtyne ſaith & recitith / that it is a more ſwete odour to man to ſmell a nold ſtynkinge roten dede dog: then is a ſynfull ſoule to god & of this mater ſpekith ſaint auguſtine in a ſermon the whiche he made / and by hym was drawen. A ſyn̄er there p̄ſent? in to the way of ſaluaciō. Now aduiſe & conſider poure & miſerable ſynner. what auayleth to the thy cofer full of wordly goodes / yf thy conſcience be voyde frome all good werkes / & dedis thou couetys to haue worldely goodes / and

thou wilt not be good thy ſelf. Arte thou not aſhamed to haue thy houſe full of goodis: And thou repleniſſhed with ſo many euyllis. Nowe anſwere me to this queſtion what is it that thou woldeſte haue euyle. Firſte thou woldeſt not haue a neuyle wyfe / euill children / nor euile ſeruaūtꝭ / nor yet euill gowne / nor euyll hoſeen. And yet thou curſed & herted in thy ſynne. woldeſt leade ſtylle a curſed lyfe. Nowe I pray the for thyne owne helthe: loue not more deerly thy hoſen then thy ſelf / that is to ſay ſo as thou woldeſt not haue euile hoſē whiche is one of the ſempleſt aparelmentis of thy body: wyll not thou to led an euile lyfe. for the good lyfe is oon of the fayreſt apparell of the ſoule all the thingis that thou ſeeſt fayre and pleſaunte: thou holdes theym and reputis theym as dere / But and thou ſee well thy ſelfe: thou ſhall repute the as vile / and ſtinking and thinke thou verily yf the gooddes wherwith thy houſe is fylled had power to ſpeke they wolde crye againſt the / ſaynge with an highe voyce / thou woldeſt haue and poſſede vs after thy appetite / & wyll / and we wolde haue a good true lorde. herken howe they crye againſt the in addreſſinge theyr deſires to god. O true god creatour of the worlde why haſt thou yeuē to this man ſo moche good and he is ſo euyle what maye it prouffite hym the greate goodes that he poſſeſſes. whan he hath noo in hym the true loue of god. that alle hathe yeuen hym / Sixtely it is to be noted / that by ſynne man is be come a brute beeſt / And therfore ſaithe Boice

in his .iiii. boke of cōſolacion / A man good / Iuſte / and trewe: yf his wiſdome and Iuſtice be lefte: he is no more man. For as ſone as he yeueth hym to ſynne: he is conuerted to a brute beeſt / And the pheloſopher in his Ethiques ſaith / That he is not oonly a beeſt but worſe & more deteſtable then a beeſt. To the whiche accordith Dauid the prophete ſayinge in this maner / man duringe the tyme that he was in honour: and to god agreable: had no wyll to vnderſtande his helthe but fell frome god / wherfore he is compared to brute beſtis: and fowle / and is made to theym ſemblable. for the .vii. and laſte poynte it is to be noted / that of ſynne is borne deuilles ſeruitude. wherof writeth ſaint Iohn̄ in his firſte Canonique in his thirde Chaptour: he that maketh or cōmytteth ſynne: is ſeruaunte to the deuill. wherfore all theis thingis conſidered: thou pore ſoroufull and miſerable ſynner haue mercy and pytie of thy ſoule. and haue noo wyll to put thy ſoule. in to ſynne: butte remembre howe by thy curſed ſynnes thou haſte offended and wrathed thy lorde god. ¶And that thou haſte reioyced thy greate enmye the deuylle. and doon / damage to thyne neyboure. ¶Nowe thenne I praye the pore ſynfull man knowe the noblenes of thy ſoule and howe greate and greuous hathe be the woū
               des of her comytted by ſynne. For the whiche of neceſſite the ſonne of god hathe ſuffered ſoo greuous paſſion. For certaynly yf the woundes of thy ſoule had ben mortall: the ſonne of god had neuer ſuffered

deth for their remedy wyll not then to deſoule and diſprayſe. when thou ſeeſt & knoweſt that his right highe mageſte hathe had ſo moche pytye and compaſſion of his ſoule. And ſaith it is ſoo that he hath ſhed tearis and wepingꝭ for the / waſſhe thou then thyne bed nightly with tearis of penaūce & cō
               tricion. He hathe ſhed his blode for the / ſhede thou thy tearis for hym by contynuall penaūce. Behold not that / that the fleſſhe wold / but cōſider that whiche the ſoule ſecheth & demaūdith: For as ſaith ſainte Gregory / for aſmoche as the fleſſhe in this worlde lyueth ſwetely in the delytꝭ & pleaſauntis therof whithin a ſhorte ſpace of tyme after the lyfe corporall: the ſoule eternally ſhalbe tourmented. & aſmoche more as the flehe in this world ſhalbe chaſtiſed ſo moche more ſhall the ſoule haue Ioy and glory in the other worlde. ¶wherfore ſaithe ſaint Auguſtine lette vs leue and put behynde vs for the honoure of Iheſu criſte: the thingis that be to be lefte & that lettyth the helth of our ſoules / to thende that for thingꝭ tranſitorye: we leſe not eternall / and conſider that if it were ſaid to the take and vſe at wyll the goodꝭ & delitꝭ of this worlde / aſmoche as ſhalle pleaſe the / on that cōdicion: that after thy Iene ſhalbe taken frome the / & thou ſhalt all the remenaūt of thy lyf contyune in lang wiſhe / hungre / payne / and myſerie. certeinly I am ſure thou woldeſte neuer thenne deſyre ſuche temporall gooddꝭ: Nowe conſider and riſe diligently thenne / For all the courſe of the lyfe of man is not to compte one monethe or

one daye / or one houre / of ſpace or tyme: in regarde or compariſon of the perpetuall curſide paynes of hell / that hath noon ende. And to the whiche noon other paine is ſemblable nor hable to be cōpared.
         
         
            ¶Howe we ought with all diligence do penaunce.
            
               SAint Mathewe in his .xiiii. Chapitour ſaithe that oure lorde wyllinge and admoneſhinge the creature to doo penaunce: ſpekith in this maner / He that takes not his croſſe & folowe me? is not worthy to haue me / by this croſſe we be taughte and geuen to vnderſtond penaūce / the whiche all ſynners ought to take and bere ꝑſeuerauntly / yf he deſyre in the beatitude eternalle to reigne with Iheſu criſte For as ſaithe ſaint Ierome in apiſtole that he wrote to Suſanne ſaynge thus / penaunce is to the ſynner neceſſarie / and ought to be ſo moche / that it be ſufficient for the cryme done againſt god / or for the more meryte that the penaunce excede the ſynne / And as ſaint Auguſtyne ſaythe who that wyll be ſaued / it behoueth hym and is to

hym neceſſarie: ofte to purge and waſſhe his conciens / with tearis / frome al the filthes / & vnclennes where with he hathe poluted & defilyde hym ſelfe frome the tyme of his baptiſme: But perauenture thou that haſt geuen and hadde all thy pleaſure of the worlde: wyll ſay in this maner. Thy ſermond and the wordes that thou ſayſte to me in aduiſing me to do penaunce: me ſemeth verie harde / For I maye not dyſprayſe the worlde / nother correcte / ne chaſtyſe my fleſſhe / Alas poore ſynner herkyn the / Doctrine not of me / but of holy ſaint Ierome / that ſaith in this maner. It is inpoſſible that a mā may vſe and Ioye the goodes of this preſent worlde here: in fyllynge his Belly and accompliſſ hynge his wyll and thought: And after this worlde thinkith to haue the delitis in the heuenly world / for he can not haue his Ioye in this erthe here: and haue the greate glory in heuen. The whiche ſentence confermeth ſancte Gregory ſaiyng thus: many there be that couite and deſyre to flee frome the preſente exile of this wolde / in to the glory and Ioye of ꝑadiſe: but yet wolde they not leue their worldly delitis / the grace of our lorde Ihū calleth theim / But the curſed concupiſcence of this worlde reuoketh and with draweth theym / ¶They wolde gladly dye as right wyſe people doth: but they wold not lye as they do. And therfore they ſhall euerlaſtingly peryſſhe / and folowe theyr werkes in to hollꝭ / & there to be in ꝑdurable dampnacion. To this purpoſe ſpeketh ſaint Barnarde to the ſynners that refuſe

penaūce / O miſerable ſyn̄ers know cōſyder in your hartꝭ the lyfe & ſtrayte cōuerſaciō of glorious ſaint Iohn̄ Baptiſte / whiche ſtrayte lyfe & conuerſacion: is to all delicious ſynners not wyllynge to doo penaunce: the verie meſſenger of eternall deth Alas we pore miſerable and vnreſonable beſtꝭ and wormes of therth: wherfore be we proude / diſpyteous and diſpleſaūt to do penaunce / ſith that we ſee that he that amonge al men was borne the moſte greate: hath wylled his holy body pure / clene / & Innocent / to chaſtice by penaunce / And we deſyre to clothe and anourne our ſynfull bodies with precious clothinge / And the good holy ſaint: had none other clothinge to his boody but the harde ſharpe ſkynne of a Camyl we couete and deſire to drinke delicious wynes: & ſainte Iohn̄ the Baptiſte that glorious frende of god dranke in the deſerte noon other thinge but clene & pure water / beholde than miſerable ſynner: Oughteſt thou then flee doynge of penaunce & folowe worldely pleaſures: I wys nay / for certainly it is not the way to paradiſe / and more to moue thyne herte to penaunce and to flee the delitis of this worlde: remembre the of the euil Riche man / that was lord and maiſter of ſo great Riches / and was dayly clothed with precious habitis / of purpyll / the whiche / not withſtandyng all the delitys that he hadde in this worlde: after his mortall lyf was paſſed: might not atteyne to haue in the neceſſyte of his brennynge & heate one oonly drope of water / for to refreſſhe and coole his tunge

¶Therfore remembre theſe thyngꝭ dere frende & do penaunce whyle thou haſt tyme & ſpace / & truſt not to moche of length of dayes / For thoughe almighty god haue ꝓmiſide ꝑdone and mercy to them that wyll do penaunce / he hath not promiſyd them certayne tyme to leue / nor yet a daye houre ne mynute. And if thou wylte knowe what is penaunce I ſay vnto the it is wepyng teares of cōtricion for thy ſynnes paſſed / with fyrme purpoſe neuer to cō
               mytte them more / For as ſaith ſaint Auguſtine the penaunce is vayne: whiche ſynne folowynge defilith. And the wepyng no thinge profetith whenne they retourne agayne to ſyn̄e. Nor to aſke ꝑdon of god: & wyll to falle agayne to ſynne. And for more declaracion thou ought to knowe & note that ther be thre maners of penaūce / that is contricion with harte / confeſſion with mouthe / and Satiſfaccion with warkꝭ / For that thre maners we offend god that is to knowe. The delectacion of thought by inprudence of wordes / and by warkꝭ of pride / and for that / that by the contrare it muſte be curide: we muſte make ſatiſfaccion to god in thre other maners / puttinge contricion againſte the delectacion of ſynne / confeſſion againſte inprudēce of wordes / Satiſfaccion againſt the warkis of pride. Nowe ſee thou firſte what is contricion / Contricion is a ſorowe wilfully taken for ſyn̄es cōmytted and done / with full purpoſe to abſtaine to make true confeſſion & dewe ſatiſfacciō / & as ſaith ſaint Barnard the ſorowe ought to be in iii. maners / that is to ſay

ſharpe / more ſharpe / and ſharpeſt / Right ſharpe: for cauſe we haue offended oure ſouerayne lorde god creator of all thingꝭ. And more ſharp: for we haue inpungued our celeſtiall fader that ſo ſwetly hath noriſſhed & fedde vs / And in that we ſo haue offended him: we may be reputed wors then doggꝭ / for the doggꝭ of their nature: louyth & folowes them that noriſſheth & fedith them. Thirdly contricion ought to be mooſt harde and ſharpe: For ſo moche that in cōmytting ſynne we offende god. And crucifie & tourment our redemer / that hath bought vs with his propre blode: and delyuered vs from the bondes of ſynne / & hath deliuered vs frome the cruelte of deuyllꝭ / and the paynes of hell / wherfore we ought to haue ſorowe and diſpleaſūce of thre thingis. ¶That is to witte of ſyn̄e cōmytted by good dedes lefte and tyme loſte as ſpekith ſaint Auguſtyne ſaiynge contricion of harte is more worth: then all the pylgrimagꝭ of the worlde / & in a clauſe made vpon the pſalme Ad dūm cum tribularar. It is ſaide god can not deſpyſe ne withſtande the repentaunce of a contrite harte: that with verie cō
               tricion beſechith his mercy / And in lyke wyſe ſaith ſaynt Iohn̄ Criſiſtome / Contricion is that oonly thinge that makith a ſoule to hate the freſſhe habitis / and maketh hym redy to loue ſharpe clothinge of hear / to loue tearis / to hate and flee pleſauntis and laughingis / for there is noo thinge that ſo conioyneth and vnityth the ſoule to god: as the tearis of a penytente. ¶And to the contrarie ſaythe

ſaint Auguſtyne we maye not yeue the deuyll morre ſharpe ſorowis: then to heale oure woundes of ſynne by confeſſion and penaunce. But alas howe be it that by penaunce and contricion we may gett ſo moche weale: And yet fewe folkis be that wolde do penaunce / ¶wherfore thus oure lorde complaineth him / ſpekinge by Ieremye / there is no mā ſpekyth that good is: nor that wolde do penaunce for ſynne cōmytted and done. The ſecounde that is to ſaye confeſſion is laufull and ſufficient occaſion and declaracion of ſynners treſpace / byfore the preeſt: For this worde confeſſion is as moche to ſaye / as an hole ſhewinge or ſhewinge of alle to geder. For he truely confeſſithe hym hoilly: that ſaithe all / Confeſſion alſo as ſaith Iſodore in the boke of his ethimologies / is that thinge by whiche the ſecreat ſekenes of the ſoule vnder hope of pardone & mercye is made open to the prayſinge of god / of the vertu of whiche ſaint Ambroſe vpon the pſalme beati inmaculati ſaith: the vengaunce of god ſeaſſith: yf mannys confeſſion make hym ſelfe clene. And Caſſidore vpon the pſalme of. Confiteantur tibi populi deus ſaithe / that god is not as Iuge / But as an aduocate for them that by true confeſſion condemneth and yeldith them ſelfe gilte: And pore leo ſaith that the ſynne abidith not to condempne man in iugement whiche by confeſſion hathe bene purged. And ſaint Auguſtyne in the boke of penaunce ſaith confeſſion is the helthe of ſoule / the mynyſhere and conſumer of ſynne / reſtorer of vertues / ¶And the

withſtander and ouercomer of the deuyll / & what more / confeſſion ſhettꝭ the gates of hel / And openith the gates of paradiſe / And for theis forſaide cauſis right dere frende truſte the coūſaile of Iſaye. Tell thyn iniquite ſo as thou maiſt be Iuſtified For the begynnynge of Iuſtice is cōfeſſion of ſynne: wherfore it behouith to confes the of all thy ſynnes holy of the whiche thou canſte knowe any remēbraūce to one preeſt whiche hath power to aſſoyle the / ſo that thou telle not ꝑte of thy ſynnes to one preeſt: & ꝑte to an other. For if thou ſhuldeſt cōfeſſe the after ſuche maner / nother the oon preeſt ne the other myghte aſſoyle the / for as ſaith ſaint Barnard / he that deuidethe his confeſſion to diuers cōfeſſours: hath no ꝑdone / For it is deteſtable faynyng of hym / that deuideth & withholdeth his ſynne frome ſhewing the verray ꝓfoundenes of his ſynne enteerly. And they that makith ſuche cōfeſſion / receiueth excōmunicacion for abſolucion / & malidiccion for bleſſynge Suſhe diuiſions & cōfeſſions is made by ypocriſie For they ſhewe their greate greuous ſynne to the preſtꝭ which they know not. And to thyem that be of their familier knowlege: they ſhewe their moſt light ſynnes / wherof ſaith ſaint Auguſtine as it is written in the decree / He that deuideth his confeſſion is not to be prayſed in noo condicion / For he kepith counſaill frome the on / that he ſheweth to the other / the whiche thinge he dooth by maner of ypocriſie / to thentent to be prayſed. Nowe lette vs ſpeke thenne of ſatiſfaccion the whiche Saint Auguſtyne

Diffynyth in this maner / Satiſfaccon is to withſtande and leue the cauſis of ſynne: and not to fauoure his ſuggeſtions ne admonicions: ſaynt Gregorye ſaithe we make not ſatiſfaccion by ſeaſſynge of ſynne: yf we leue not the voluptuous bylongeing therto. And ſhewe wepinge and lamentacion vnfayned / for oure ſynne to the whiche purpoſe ſaithe Criſoſtome ſuche as the offence afore hathe been comyſed: ſuche wyſe ought agayne to folowe the reconſiliacion and ſatiſfaccion. And aſmoche to be inclyned to wepyngis and lamentacion as thou haſte been inclyned to ſynne. ¶And to take as greate / deuocion to penaunce: as thou haſte hadde greate intente to commytte ſynne. ¶For thy greate and mighty ſynnes deſyreth the greate lamentacions wherof ſaithe Euſebeus byſſhoppe / by lyghte contricion maye not be payde the deibte the whiche is due to the dethe eternall: For ſynne / ne with lytell ſatiſfaccion the fyre eternall that is made redde for the euyll may be quenched / but many be ſoone wery in this mortall lyfe to doo penaunce and retourne frome the waye of ſatiſfaccion / lokynge bakwarde as dyde the wyfe of lothe: agaynſte the whiche ſpekythe ſaynt Barnarde in a ſermonde: and ſaithe / he that perfectely felythe and perceuyth the peyſaunt dedes of ſynne and the leſyon and ſekenes of the ſoule: can not lyghtely fele & perceyue the paynes of the body / nor repute the laboures any thinge: by the whiche he may do a waye ſynnes paſſed & withſtand theym

that be to cōme / And as ſaint Auguſtine ſaith vpon the .xv. pſalme / many be that haue noo ſhame to cō
               mytte ſynne / but they haue greate ſhame to doo penaunce / O vnbelefull creature and far oute of thy reaſon / canſte thou not haue ſhame and horrour of the great woūdes of ſynne: Seeſt thou not what foule ſtinke & Rotennes is therin renne to the medicyne and do penaunce and ſaye my lord god my creature I knowe myne Iniquite / and ſoo clerly: that my ſynne is alwaye againſte me / to the oonly I haue cōmytted ſynne whiche is oonly withouten ſynne / Farthermore it is to be knowen that ſatiſfaccion is in thre thinges / that is to wytte in prayer / almes and in faſting. To thende that the noumbre of thre be oppoſite againſte thre falce and deuely ſynnes / prayer againſte pryde / Faſtinge againſt concupiſcence of the fleſſhe / and almes againſt Couetous / And for all thinge that is cōmytted againſte god is ordened prayer / And for the ſynne againſte his neyghboure is ordeyned almes: and for the ſynne againſt hym ſelfe / is ordeyned faſtinge / And for more declaracion of ſatiſfaccion he fpekyth ſomwhat of almes Almes is as moche to ſaye after the maner of ſpekinge: as cōmaundemente of mercy. And in this maner ought this worde to be written Elemoſina by E and ſome tyme they write Elimoſina by I then is it aſmoche to ſaye as the cōmaundemente of god / For he hym ſelfe cōmaunded it to be done with his owne propre mouthe: wherof ſaithe Ieremye / yeue almes: and all thingꝭ ſhalbe

you pure & clene / Or thirdly Almes may be ſaid after ſume the water of god / for as water quencheth fyre of almes dede quencheth ſynne. wherfore it is to knowe that thre thingꝭ principally ought to moue vs to do and accompliſſhe almes / and werkꝭ of mercy. ¶The fyrſte is / for mercy bieth agayn the gilte of ſynne / for ſo moche as it is wirtten in the ꝓuerbe in the .xvi. Chapitour / by mercy vanite & iniquitie is bought agayn / And danyell reſitith in his xiiii. chapitour ſpeking of a woman that put in all the veſſellis that ſhe hadde a lytell quantite of oyle. And a noon the oyle grewe ī ſuche maner that ſhe paide and pacified her creditours. The veſſellis of the woman / betokeneth the poore people whiche we ſholde call in to oure houſis: For as ſaith Iſaie in his .liii. chapitour lede and calle the poore to thy houſe and kepe theym: And with that thou haſte: that is to ſaye diſtrybute parte of thy ſubſtaūce to this pore veſſels / moche lyke to that ſaith Thobye yf thou haue lytell to yeue yet ſtudy to yeue and departith the pore wyllingly / For then ſhall growe the oyle of mercye / when by gracious meritis. the ſynfull ſoule hathe made ſatiſfaccion to god for his ſynnes. ¶The ſecounde thinge that ought to meue vs to yeue almes is / for it encreaſes and multiplyes the temporall goodes / as ſaithe ſaint Gregory in his dialoge / worldly ſubſtaunce be multiplied. For ſo moche as they be deſtribute and yeuen to the poore. we haue example in the thirde booke of kinges in the xvi. chapitour of the widowe that

fedde healy / to whome almighty god multiplied booth brede and oyle / wherby it is vnderderſtande that more is to almous prouffitable to theym that fedeth the pore: then to the pore that receyueth it. ¶Thirdly wherfore we ought to doo almes and werkes of mercy is: for that / that almous kepeth the almes yeuer / of the houre of dethe / and ledeth with clernes and Ioye his ſoule to the Realme of heuen. And therfore ſaith ſaint Ambroſe / that mercy is the oonly helpe to theym that ben paſſed. ¶O what felyſhyppe is it of almes to hym that dyeth / leue not then ſo trewe and ſoo goode a ſeruaunte / nor put ſuche an aduocate behinde thy backe / ne doo not as they that in their lyfe withholddeth their goodes by ſuche brennynge Couetous: that neuer with theyr propre handes / departed almes to the pore / For ſuch be ſemblable to hym that for to ſee clerly his wayes berith his lyght behynde his backe / but doo as is taught to the by Eccleſiaſticus / ſaye not to thy frende of thy ſoule that is to ſaye to Iheſu criſte: or to the pore that ſhall aſke the almes. ¶My frende goo and cōme agayne to morowe and thenne I ſhall yeue the / All be it that that thou mayſte yeue hym. whanne he aſkyth it. ¶For it is to be knowen that the riche of whome the poore aſketh almes: ought to conſider thre thinges Firſte who it is that aſketh / for god hym ſelfe loueth ſo moche the poore that all that is yeuen to theym in the honoure of hym: he repentis to hym ſelfe. ¶And for ſo moche as it is wrytten in the

thirde Chapitour of ſaynt Mathewe / alle that ye ſhall doo to any / oon of the leeſt ſeruauntis: ye doo it to me / god by the pore demaundeth almes of the Riche / and the riche demaundeth of god the realme of heuen / ſoo that the riche ought well to drede to refuſe or deney his almous to the poore / leeſt that almyghty god wyll deny his prayer and aſkynge of the Realme of heuen. For it is written in the prouerbes in the .xxi. Chapitoure / He that cloſeth his eers whanne he hereth the poore crye: the tyme ſhall cōme that he ſhalle crye and god ſhalle not here hym. ¶Secoundly / the ryche ſhuld well conſyder what thynge it is that god aſketh when by his poore people he aſkethe almous / Certaynly he aſketh noo thynge of oures / But god aſketh his oonly owen / wherfore he may welle be called vnkynde to god: whanne he denyeth to the poore his neceſſarye almous: whanne he hathe metys and drynkes with other goodes aboundauntely: the whiche thynges well conſydered Dauid: where he ſaythe in paralipomynone in his .xxix. Chapitour. ¶Oo my god and my lorde alle thynge be thyne: and we haue noon other thyngis to yeue the but oonly that / that we haue receyued and taken of thy hande. ¶For trewely oure lorde god aſketh by the poore noo thynge: butte that is his: and apperteynethe to him: and not to haue yeuen / butte oonly to leane it / ¶And not oonly to yelde therfore the dowble or thirde parte: but as an vſuret wyll encreace it a hundreth tymes more·

¶O poore ſynner doo thenne after the ſaiynge of ſaint Auguſtyne / yeue to god for vſerie and thou ſhalte take an .C. tymes more and poſſede the lyfe eternall To moche thou arte vnkynde if thou wil not yeue to god. For god to vſuri as thou woldeſt do to a Iew or a ſaraſyne. And therfore conſider all theis thyngis / and I derely praye the aſſemble to gether the pore / and by theim make thy treaſour in henen / in doynge the werkꝭ of mercy: and make not thy treſoures here in the Erth / but the harte of a couetous man is as a pytte withoute a bothome. The more it receyueth the more it wolde haue And yet it is neuer full / And ſo ſaith Eccleſiaſticus in the .vii. Chapitour. The couetous man ſhall neuer be fulfylled with money / for the herte alwaye folowith the treaſour / ſorowe maye be ſaide to theym that in perlyous exile of this worlde makyth their treaſoure / and vppon that ſaith criſoſtome: aſſemble thy ſubſtaunce in place and countrey: where ſhalbe thy dwellynge / for he that makith his treſoure but in the erth: ſhal noon haue in heuē when he no thinge hath put there / And beleue ſuerly that the thinge thou ſhall fynde there: is oonly the good thou haſte yeuen to the poore. The goodes be not a mannys whiche he may not guyde ne bere with hym / Now vnderſtand the fayre auctorite of ſaint Ambroſe / he ſaithe that noo thinge is of ſo great cō
               mendacion towardes god as pity and charite / the good doctor ſayde I haue beholde many bookes & ſcriptures butte I can not remember that I haue

founde of any man: that wyllingly hath excerſiſed the workes of mercy and pytie and viliouſly dyed And pope leo ſaithe he yeueth and ſendeth to god precious and encere fruytis: that neuer lectyth the pore departe frome hym diſpurneid or ſorowfull. For the vertue of mercy is ſoo great / that without that: alle the other maye not prouffite. And howe be it that a man be true chaſte / ſobyre / garniſſhed / and adryched with many other vertues: yf he be not mercyful and piteous neuer ſhal he fynde mercy. And this that I haue ſayde of vertues / Almes and werkes of mercy / conceruyng the pore people ſuffiſyth / And nowe we ſhall retourne to the purpoſe of the begynnynge of this Chapitour / where it is ſayde: he that takes not his croſſe and cōmyth after me: is not worthy to be with me. this croſſe ought to be taken in the tyme of youthe / and ſtrenghte to the whiche purpoſe it is ſayde in the ſecoū
               de chapitour of Eccleſiaſtice: remember the of thy ceator in the daies of thy youth / For thenne it profityth a man mooſt: and moſte pleaſyth god / In lyke wyſe he ſaith / ſon tary not to cōuerte the to god: and differre not frome daye to daye / For his Ire ſhall cōme on the ſodeinly. And in the tyme of vengeaunce he ſhall diſtroye the / But agaynſt the helthefull counſayle of the wyſe / the deuill yeueth and promiſeth to man enyl & damnable hope of longe lyf ſaiyng thou arte yonge and ſhall lyue and thou mayſte goo to confeſſyon and doo penaunce. ¶O thies poore ſynners howe they be deceyued

that ſoo lyghtly beleueth in his deceytis: and in the falſe hoope of longe lyfe / purpoſynge in their aige to currecte theym ſelfe / and amende / and thenne cō
               meth ſoden deth / and fynably rauyſſheth and taketh them to dampnacion. ¶And for ſo moche as it is ſayde in Eccleſiaſtico in the .xxix. chapitour That by the promiſſion and hope of longe lyfe many be putte to perdicion. Nowe is it then to note that ſuche deuiliſhe promiſe of longe lyfe and thinkynge to doo penaunce in age: is full euylle / for it is agaynſte right and reaſon / And yet is it worſe / For it is alſo agaynſte the ſynner hym ſelfe / ¶And more euyll it is againſt the ſouerayne boū
               tie of god / and that it is agaynſte right and reaſon it apperith by thre enſamples / the firſte example is: that who that hadde .x. aſſes and ſhulde yeue the greteſt burthen of charge to bere to the moſt feble: he ſhulde do agaynſte reaſon and good Iuſtice. ¶And ſo wyll he that oonly wyll yeue to hym ſelfe in his aige the charge and burthen of the ſynnes that he hath cōmytted in his youth / and ſtrengthe / for thenne he yeueth the burthen to the mooſt feble aſſe: that is to ſay to the debilitie of age / For in age man hathe no ſtrength ne vertue to bere labour or payne. And they that ſo differre their penaūce: deſerueth malediccion of god as it is written in zacaria in the firſte chapitour / The man full of fraude is curſed that in his beſtiall lyfe hathe doon many euyllis / and makyth ſacrifice to god of the worſte / and the mooſt poore amendemente.

¶And in lyke wyſe is he curſed that in the delitis of this worlde paſſeth the tyme of his youthe and ſtrength / and differreth to make true ſacrifice vnto almyghty god: tyll the tyme of feble and olde aige cōme vppon hym / ¶And therfore ſayth Iſodore / he that lyueth the conuenable tyme of penaūce / It ſhalbe to hym but as voyde thinge to cōme to the yate of god to praye. ¶The ſecounde example is / that he that in hys ſtrength and power is not hable to lyfte a ferdell in his youth: and whanne he commeth to feblenes of aige thenne wolde take vppon hym the charge: myght welbe reputed a verye foole. ¶So in lyke wyſe is he that in his youthe whyles ſtrength is in hym: woll not take vppon hym the dedes of penaunce whiche thenne maye be to him light. And hopeth better to do them in his age whanne there ſhall be augmented in hym: greate debilite and feblenes / he well maye be reſembled to a fole. ¶wherof as it is ſayde in the lyfe of faders that one went and kutte a fagotte of woode and thenne aſſayed to lyfte it / and founde it to heuye. ¶And yet he wente to an other woode and putte in more / and wolde haue lyfted it / and founde it ſo moche more heuy to bere / ¶In this manere doth the ſynners whan they take the charge of ſynnes and leueth to do penaunce / from daye to day puttynge & adioynynge ſynne vpon ſynne. For as ſaith ſaynt Gregory / the ſynnes that by penaunce is not purged & taken away: of his nature

deſyrith and drawyth to hym other ſynnes. ¶The thyrde example is / he that all his lyfe hathe hadde greate ſtudy and cure with worke men to prepayre and make an howſe in the whiche he neuer hathe purpoſe ne hoope to inhabite ne dwelle / ¶And the houſe whiche he deſyreth to dwelle in wolde vtterly diſtroye to his power: It were a iuſte cauſe to repute hym a defamed foole. Nowe ought men then to knowe and vnderſtande that ſo is it of the ſyn̄er yt vnto the deth deſireth to tourne hym to god and alwaye deſireth and coueteth to lyue in the delytis and voluptuyſnes of this ſorowfull and myſerable worlde: folowynge euyll companyes / by the whiche he hathe greate occaſions to commytte many deedly ſynnes / by the meane wherof: He all the tyme of his lyfe is makynge redy and prepayreth his houſe in helle / where noo man ſhulde wyll to dwelle. ¶And therfore ought they to dred and doubte the ſentence of ſancte Paule / who ſaithe / he that gooth and dooth agaynſte his conſciens: he edifieth hym ſelfe an houſe and lodgynge in helle. ¶And for to ſhewe and proue that the promyſe and hoope of longe lyfe is yet more euyll agaynſte the ſynner. ¶It apperethe and is to vs clerly ſhewed by two examples. ¶wherof the firſte is he that ſhulde deſyre rather to be ſeke thenne hole and in ſeruitude rather then in lybertye: and to haue no thing leuer then to poſſeſſe his ꝑte of al the goodꝭ of the world: he ſhuld be

agaynſte hym ſelfe In lyke condicion is the ſynner when he tarieth to do penaūce For he loueth better to be in ſynne whiche is the ſpiritualle ſekenes of ſoule. And not oonly ſykenes but eternall deth. Deſireth rather his dedly ſykenes then his eternall lyfe / wherby it clerely apperith that of the obſtinate ſyn̄er it ought wel to be ſayd that he is euyll againſte hym ſelfe ſo that he loueth ſekenes better thenne helthe and deth then lyfe / ſeruitude / then fredome / euyll then gode / As ſaithe ſaint Iohn̄ in his canonique / He that doth ſynne is in the ſeruitude of ſynne / And ſaint Auguſtyne ſaith that a man good iuſte / and trewe. Not withſtanding that he be in ſeruitude is in his bounte kepe alway free and in his fraunchies / But the euyll ſynfull man not withſtā
               dynge he reigne and be dred and honoured in this worlde he ſhall alwaye dwell in curſed ſeruitude / and that worſe thynge is to ſaye: as longe as he ſhall endure in the boundage of vices and ſynnes He ſhalbe in the boundage of euyll lordes and reulers. The ſecounde example is this / he that ſhulde owe a greate ſomme of money to a vſurer whiche ſhuld growe and be augmented from daye to day So that he ſhulde not be in power to paye it but wolde euer tary as longe as he might. He ſhulde greatly doo agaynſt hym ſelfe / ſo to purpoſe aſmoche more as the ſynfull man ſhall dwel in ſynne: ſo moche more ſhalle he be bounde to payne wherof it is written in the booke of apocalips in the .xvi. chapitour aſmoche as the ſynner glorifieth hym in

his delitis ſoo moche more he yeueth hym ſelfe to tourmente wepynge and payne. ¶Thyrdely the promyſe of longe lyfe is ryght euylle and daūgerous / in ſo moche as it is agaynſt the wyl of god / as it the apperyth by .iii. examples / the fyrſte is yf it were that a yonge man were impungnynge and contrarye to his mayſter: of the whiche he ſholde haue alle his weall by the ſpace of his lyfe. ¶And that he thenne lefte his propre lorde and mayſter / for to ſerue the Enmye of the ſame durynge the tyme of his ſtrengthe and youthe. ¶And whanne he ſhulde comme at impotencie and be atteynted wyth aige and feblenes: thanne wolde retourne to his fyrſte maiſter in offerynge hym his ſeruyce for the remmenaunte of his lyfe: ſuche a ſeruaunte myght well be reputed of euyll and vntrewe cōdicion / and noo thynge to be thoughte agreable to the ſeruice of ſuche a man In this maner is it of the ſynner / he offendeth god and ſeruyth his enmye the deuyll / endurynge his ſtrength and youthe and purpoſith / to ſerue god in his feble aige. ¶The ſecounde example is / yf there were any that hadde receyued of his lorde gerate gyftis and goodes wherby he myghte haue greate wynnynge and aduauntage: and yf he wolde diſpende and waſte theym for noughte: he myghte well be called a foole / and vnkynde to his mayſter / the whyche thynge dooth the ſynner indirectely doynge agaynſte the goodnes of god.

¶And in commyttynge ſynne diſpendeth foleouſly and waſtethe vnkyndely the goodes that hys creatoure hathe yeuen hym / that is to knowe / the ſoule / the body / the wytte by the whyche hys ſoule is enobliſſhed / the ſtrenght and vertue of his body / hys worldely goodis temporall / the ſpace of his lyfe / and manye other fayre and greate yeftys and benyfictis that of god he hathe receyued / ſaint Gregory ſpekynge of the ſoule: whiche god hathe gyuen vs as a precious tresſoure / to vſe reaſonably in doynge meritorious workes: by the whyche we maye gette the Realme of paradyſe ſaythe in this manere / Curſes and ſorowes be to me yf I by my neclygence fayle to kepe the Treaſoure and Iowell that the precious lambe vndefyled Criſte Iheſu hathe wylled full derely to bye agayne. And for the tyme that god hathe geuen vs in this mortall lyfe as ſaith the ſaide ſaint Gregory: thou haſte not in this worlde daye / houre / ne mynett / ne ſpace of tyme. wherof thou ne ſhalte yelde accōmptis byfore god / Howe & in what operacions thou haſte inployed thy tyme. ¶The thirde example is yf the ſeruauntis whiche haue the diſpendinge of their lordꝭ goodꝭ yeue to ſtrangers and his Enmyes the beſt brede and wynes and yeue and mynyſtre to his lorde the vitaylly that be corrupte rotten and ſtynkynge: He ſhulde doo vniuſtly and falſely agaynſte the wyll of his maſter / and ryght ſoo dooth the ſynner that alle the beſte tyme of hys yeres that is to ſaye in his youthe geuyth hym ſelf

to the worlde and to the deuyll: whiche be the enmyes of Iheſu criſte and purpoſeth to yeue to god the worſte whiche is the olde ende of theyr lyfe: Alas dyde not thus whiche ſayd / my god my creatoure my ſtrength my beaute and my youthe: will I oonly to thy ſeruice kepe and to this purpoſe it is ſayde in eccleſiaticꝭ geue not to god the rottennes and dregges of thyne aige butte preſente vnto hym the free wyne pure and clene of thy floriſſhinge youthe / Item ſaint Gregory ſpekythe of theym / Alſo that deferre to doo penaunce / and ſaythe the ſynner is to ferre ſtraunge frome the faithe and loue of god that for doynge of penaunce abideth the tyme of his age / For he then hath not in his powre any tyme or houre of his lyfe wherfore and throughe the counſayle of Iſodore euery power ſynner ought diligently with alle his myght whenne he maye retourne hym to god for who that doth not penaunce. when he maye: when he wolde he ſhall not do it. Doo then penaunce and tary not to thende that thou be not encloſed withoute heuen with the foliſſhe virginys.

no thynge is but gnaſtynge of teeth / howlynge And wepynge / noo helpe to be goten / to late to do penaūce / On euery ſyde & in euery ꝑte vexed inceſſauntly with paynes intollerable / And neuer to haue any parte of ſolace. ¶There ſhall no creature appere byfore oure Iyen: but only the myneſters and tourmentours of hell / to mineſter paynes in euery ſyde / and that worſte is of all: there ſhalbe no comfore of the ayre nother of ſight / O good lorde what feare ſhall be to theym that ſhall ſuffre theis paynes / what breakyng of bowellꝭ / what cruſhinge of membres / what & howe many dyuerſe crucifiyngis ſhalbe in euery ſenſible parte of body and ſoule: truly no creature maye expreſſe by any meane / Saint Criſoſtome ſpekynge of the loſſe of the ſight of gode whiche is called pena dāni ſaith theſe wordes / perauenture ſūme and many folke doo thinke no payne to greate of theis forſaid paynes: yf they might eſcape the daunger of hell / but I call moche more greuous paynes than hell: to be remouyd / excluded / and caſt oute: from the grace of god / frome alle goodnes prepared and made redy for good and holy people / And mooſt of all: the priuacion and lakke of the ſight of god / to be hated of criſte / and to her of hym this ferefull worde: I knowe you not / For ſothe it is better a thouſande tymes: to ſuffer lightnynge / thenne to ſee that bleſſed lorde full of mekenes and pyty againſte vs / as our aduerſarye / And to ſuffer the Iyen of all tranquillite and reſte to beholde vs. ¶O meke ſonne of

god: we beſeche the / lette vs not ſuffre theys paynes / nother haue in experience: the intollerable and horrible tourmentrie / woo ſhall to vs that thynke not nother haue any remembraunce of theis foreſayde paynes / ¶For we doo nowe as men that by necligence: and thinkith theym ſelfe ſure: takynge noo hede of bodye nor ſoule / But gooth wythoute lette: in to the ſayde paynes of helle / perauenture ſūme man wyll ſaye that it ſemethe god to be vnrightwyſe / for man is punyſſhed eternally for one deadly ſynne done in one houre / Saynt Gregorye aſkith the ſayde queſtion: and geuyth ſolucion to it on this manere / Almyghty god whiche is a ſtreyghte Iuge: dooth not conſider the wordes of men oonly: but alſo he payſeth the hertys. And ſo it is: that yf the wykked people myght lyue in this worlde euer: they wolde perſeuerantly contynue in their wyckydnes / and neuer amende them ſelfe / For truly they that neuer wylle leaue ſynne: ſhewyth and deſyryth alwaye to lyue in ſynne. ¶Therfore it longyth to / the greate rightwyſnes of god: to punyſſhe them by eternall payne: whiche in this lyf wold neuer be out of ſynne / ¶And that noone ende of payne be geuen to the ſynfull creature: that whilis he lyued in this worlde: wolde haue noone ende of ſynne. ¶And other reaſon why that oon deadly ſynne byndith a man to eternalle payne maye be taken: conſyderynge hym to whome the offence is done / whyche is the god of all goodnes and myght.

¶Therfore the offence done: is worthy eternall / payne / For as ariſtotill ſaith ī the .vii. of his ethic In howe moche the ꝑſone is greater indignitie to whome the offence or treſpace is done: ſo moche more it ought to be punyſſhed / and Criſoſtome accordinge to the ſame ſaith / An Iniure or wronge done to a perſone: is to be conſidered as the perſone is / A lytell offence done to a great perſone indignite: is great / And great cryme cōmytted to a ſymple bodye: is compted but as a lytell faulte / O my dere and welbeloued frende: knowynge and oft remembrynge in thyne harte theis paynes byfore reherſed beſely take hede & ſee: for the helth of thyn owne ſoule / And euer beholde inwardly the greate paynes of hell to be beleued / Conſider in thy ſelf what thingꝭ be profitable and holſome to thy ſoule / whether it is better to wayle / to be ſorye / and often to aſke mercy for thy ſyn̄es in this world: than to wepe in euerlaſtynge fyre / without remedye or profite / thou ſhall deſerue ī ſhort tyme of this worlde: yf thou wyll / by penaunce and ſorowe for thy ſynnes: forgeuenes / & euerlaſtyng comforte. Therfore be ſory for thy ſyn̄es here in this lytell tyme: to thentente thou may hereafter be deliued forme the ſorowe euerlaſtynge / Meke thy ſelfe in this worlde: that peraduenture thou be not made meke in the paynes of hell / and be caſte in to the fyre vnhable to be quenched Bleſſyd is that creature that in this worlde hatyth and makyth hym ſelfe redy to be foūde hable at the daye of Iugement: with the

people that be worthy to be ſaued / And wretched is that creature whiche by his ſynne hathe made hym ſelfe vnhable to haue the glorye of oure lorde / At the houre of the daye of Iugemente by the power of god: the clowdes ſhall take vppe to heuen: body and ſoule of theym that be ſaued / And the deuellis ſhalle take bodye and ſoule of the dampned creatures: Caſtynge them in to the fornaſe the of brennynge fyre of hell. ¶who ſhall geue to myne heade a great porcion of water: and to myne Ien the founten of teares: beſely flowinge oute / that I my ſelfe maye wepe / daye and nyght / beſechynge our lorde I be not founde vnſtable in the houre of his cōmynge: And that I maye deſerue: not to here the fearefull ſentence of oure lorde / whenne he ſhall ſaye: Goo fro me: ye that hathe ben the doers of wyckedneſſe / I knowe not what ye be / whiche oure lorde Iheſu Criſte: tourne a waye frome vs / that leueth and reigneth for euermore. Amen.
