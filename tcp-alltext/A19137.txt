And by all comune reaſon, yf thou kepe this conuenient order to god and his creatures, they ſhall kepe theyr order to the: But yf thou breke thyne order to them, of lykelyhood they ſhall breke their order to the. For how ſhulde thy wyfe, chyldren, ſeruauntes, and other creatures with whome thou haſte doynges, do theyr dueties, and kepe theyr order to the, yf thou doeſt not ſo to god and to them? And alſo thynke thou of a ſuretie, that yf thy ſenſuall appetite be not ordred by reaſon and grace, thou arte worſe ordred than a beeſt / for thā thou lyueſt out of order, and ſo doeth not a beeſt / whiche is a great ſhame and rebuke to the a reaſonable creature / and without the great mercy of god, it ſha

And therfore thynke and thanke god, & vtterly diſpiſe thy ſelfe, and thynke thy ſelfe a great wretche in that, that god hath done ſo moche for the / and thou haſte ſo ofte offended his highnes, and alſo done hym ſo lytle ſeruyce. Surely it is alſo great wiſdom to thynke, that if it had pleaſed god for to haue gyuen to all other men (aſwell beggers as other) lyke grace as he hath gyuen to the, that they wolde haue ſerued his goodnes better thā thy ſelfe haſt don: wherfore, thynke thy ſelfe a wretche of all wretches, without the mercye of god.

            ¶ Fyrſte and principally, honour god as thy maker / loue hym as thy redemer / feare hym, as thy iudge. Seconeyly, thy neighbour whiche is thy ſuperior, obey. Haue concorde and peace with them whiche ben euen with the

in degree / and haue mercy and pitie on thyne inferiors▪ Thirdly, prouide the to haue a clene hert, and a good cuſtody of thy tonge. Pray and take labour by grace to haue wiſdome & cunnynge to do thy duetie to god and to thy neyghbour. And in all thy wordes and dedes, haue euer in mynde that god & his aungels hereth & ſeeth euery thinge
                  •
                and that nothynge is ſo priuely doon, but it ſhall be made open. And in eſpecyall haue in mynde that thou ſhalte dye ſhortly / & how Chriſt dyed for the / the ſubtyltie & falſnes of this temporall world / the ioyes of heuen, and the paynes of hell. And euery mornynge amonge other thy meditacions and prayers / pray vnto thy lorde god that the day folowynge / thou (accordynge to the degree / the whiche of his infynyte goodnes and mercy hath called the vnto) mayſte vſe this temporall wretched worlde in thy thoughtes / wordes / and dedes, that by them / and the meryte of Chriſtis paſſion / thou mayſt eſchewe the paynes of hell / and come to the ioye euerlaſtynge. And in

executyng therof, kepe trouthe in wordes and dedes. Defende no man / nor no matter agaynſt the trouthe. In all thynges thynke and truſt in god / and he ſhall dyrecte thy wayes. Truſt not to thyne owne wytte, but feare god / and he wyll kepe the from yuell. If thou truſte more in thyne owne wytte than in the grace of god / thy polycye ſhall be ſoone ſubuerted. Be contente to here good counſayle, thoughe it be contrarye to thy wyll, for he is a very foole, that wyll here nothyng gladly / but that is accordynge to his mynde. Do thou no man harme, leſt thou ſuffreſt the ſame. As thou willeſt be done vnto the, ſo do thou vnto an other. Be ſuche to other, as thou deſyreſte they ſhulde be to the. If thou be religious remēbre that the due executiō of true religion, is not in wearyng of the habyte, but with a clene mynde in very dede to execute the rules & ordinaūces of religion. For ſo it is, yt to weare the habite / and not to execute the rule and order of religiō, is rather to be demed ypocryſy or apoſtaſy, than other wyſe.

If thou be laye & vnmaryed, kepe the clene vnto the tyme thou be maryed. And remembre the ſore and terrible punyſſhement of Noes flood, and of the terryble fyre and brymſtone, and ſore punyſſhment of Sodom and Gomor, don to man for miſuſyng of the fleſſhe. And in eſpecyall, call to remembraūce the meruailous and horryble punyſſhment of the abhominable great pockes, dayly apperynge to our ſightes, growynge in & vpon mannes fleſſhe / the whiche ſoore punyſſhement (euery thynge well remembred) can not be thought, but principally for the inordinate miſuſe of the fleſhe. And if thou intende to marye, or beynge maryed, & haſte a good wyfe, thanke our lorde therfore, for ſhe is of his ſendynge.
            And remembre that thre thinges in eſpecyall ben pleaſaunt to the ſpyrite of god / that is to ſay, concorde betwene bretheren, loue and charitie betwene neighbours, and a man and his wyfe well agreynge. And yf thou haue an euyll wyfe, take pacience, and thanke god, for all is for the beſt, well taken / 

how beit, thou art bounden to do and pray for her amēdement, 
                  •
               eeſt ſhe go to the deuyll, from whom ſhe came. And haue in remembraunce that the intent of maryage is not in the beeſtly apperyte or pleaſure in the thynge: but the intent therof, is to eſchew the ſynne of the fleſſhe, or els to haue chyldren.
            And yf thou haue chyldren, as moche as thou mayſt, brynge them forthe in vertue to be the ſeruauntes of god.
            For it is better for the, and them not to be borne, than otherwiſe. In thyne aucthoritie, buſy the rather to be beloued of thyne inferiors, than to be dred. Let thy ſubiectes and ſeruauntes rather ſerue & obey the for loue, than for drede or nede. with ſuche a ſouereigne goodnes gouerne thy ſubiectes, that they may be glad to ſerue the bothe in punyſſhynge, and alſo in cheryſſhyng. Kepe a manerly meane / and be not to ſtrait / forgyue not to ſoone / kepe a conuenient meaſure in all thy workes.
            Go not to meat as a beeſt, but as a reaſonable man, ſay thy grace / & than remembre that mo ben ſicke and dye by

ſuperfluities of meates / than otherwyſe, wherfore eate with meaſure; to lyue in helthe. At thy

For where as is great ſweryng, from thens is neuer the plage of god. In no wyſe braule ne chyde without an vrgent cauſe. For Solomon ſayth, better is a lytell with ioye, thā a hous full of vitayle with brawlynge. Alſo he ſayth, an yuell perſone is euer chydynge, and therfore the angell of god ſhall be ſent agaynſt hym. Be content at thy dyner, and alſo at other tymes to gyue parte of that which god hath ſent the / for he that wyll not here the crye of a poore man, he ſhall crye to god, & not be harde. After thy meate, thanke god of that he hath ſente the, or els thou doſte not as a reaſonable man, but lyke a beeſt, which in eatyng remembreth nothynge but his meate.

with good prouidence and diſcretionle the tyme where, whan, howe, why, or wherfore thou ſpekeſt, doeſt, or byddeſt any thyng to be done. whan thou iudgeſte any, be he poore or ryche, beholde & conſider the cauſe, and not the perſone. Be as meke in other mennes cauſes and offences, as in thyn owne. Syt neuer in dome & iugement without pitie or mercy. for whyle thou haſt pitie, and arte mercyfull to other m
                  •
               s offences, thou haſt mercy on thy ſelfe. For in what meaſure thou meaſureſi, it ſhall be meaſured to the. yet thou muſt execute iudgement, but it muſte be with pitie or mercy. For (of a ſurety) to do mercy & iuſtice, is more pleaſaunt to god, than to praye or do ſacrifice vnto hym. Deme no man by light ſuſpections. Fyrſte proue, and than deme. In doubles, reie

And remembre, as a man loueth, ſo he is / for the louer is in the thyng loued more properly, than in hym ſelfe: wherfore, yf a man loue erthely thynges, he may be called an erthely man. And if he loue principally heuēly thynges or god, he may be called an heuenly or a godly man: And therfore loue god and heuenly thynges / for vndoubted, that is beſt, & mooſt aſſured loue / for they be, and euer ſhall, permanent / and all erthely thynges ben ſoone vanyſſhed and ended / and ſo the loue of them is in vayne. Alſo it is wyſdom to feare god / for as he ſayeth hym ſelfe: Feare not hym that may kyll the body, & can not hurt the ſoule: but feare hym that can kyll the bodye & alſo the ſoule, & commyt them to euerlaſtynge payne / wherfore, euery euenynge ere thou goo to bed, call to remembraūce (as moche as thou canſt) thy thoughtes, wordes, and dedes, ſayd and done that day / and if any haue ben to thyne owne profyte, and to the pleaſure of god, hertely thanke hym / for by his grace it was done: And yf any haue

ben contrary to his pleaſure, aſke hertely mercy, and recōcile thy ſelfe ſhortly by repentaūce to eſchewe the euerlaſtynge and terrible paynes of hell. For (as ſaynt Auguſtyn ſayth) there is not a greater madnes, than for a lytle temporall delectacion (whiche is ſoone done) to leſe the eternall ioye, and to be bounde to euerlaſtynge payne. From the whiche the almyghty father of heuen, by his infynyt power and mercy, and bytter paſſion, and infynyte wyſdome of Ieſu Chriſte, and by the infinite goodnes and charitie of the holy gooſte, kepe vs. Amen. Deo gratias.
