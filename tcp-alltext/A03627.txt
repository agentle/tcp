            ¶To the fayethfull and liuely members of our sauiour Iesus Christ, inhabytinge the city of London, grace and peace from the heauenlye father throughe our lord Iesus Christ.
            YOure fayeth and firme hope of eternall life (dearelye beloued) whyche of longe time ye haue learned and throughly perswaded your selues in, by the truth & vnfallible verity of the heauenly word, sealed with Christes moost precious blood, is very sore and daungerously assaulted, and by all meanes possible attempted to be taken from you, that ye shuld haue no lōger credit to gods truth but beleue mans lies, no more to haue saluation by Christ ye once dyed, & offered him selfe once for all forsyn, but ye ye must beleue nowe your saluatiō in Christ many times offred by wycked men euery day in the abhominable masse, to y• v

                  •
               athe taughte you. But this sodayne and miserable chaunge from the truth vnto falshod and from God and Christe to the deuyll and Antichriste, doubtlesse cometh of god for our manifold synnes towardes the heauenlye father oure shephearde, that taughte vs a longe tyme wyth hys blessed word, and we were neither than

               kful for it, nor yet put our trusts in him, as in one that onelye coulde saue and defende hys owne worde: but we thought in our foolyshenesse that the worlde was so muche and so many wayes wyth the worde of God, that euen by mannes strength it myghte haue bene defended: where as the truthe of Goodes worde is permanent
                  •
                and neuer fayleth saying, cursed be the

                that make fleshe theyr defence and shylde. For as kynge Dauyd when God

               eted,

but yet the Lord turned his face from him, and he found streight way such an alteration as he neuer found before, wyth increase of new daungers more troublous thē euer he had before: euen likewise when god had geuen vs a blessed and holye kinge, and suche maiestrates (although thei were synners) as wyshed the glorye of God onely to be preferred by true doctrin: we lyke carnal men thought our selues so sure, and so stablished, that it had not bene possible to haue seene suche a pitious and myserable chaunge, and the truthe of Goddes worde opressed as we see at this presente daye. But we be most worthely punished, and euen the same wa
                  •
               es that we offēded. We put our trust in fleshe, and where as Gods spirite in fleshe dwelled, as in oure holye and blessed kynge departed Edwarde the syxte (who is deadde in the fleshe, and hys holy soule reffeth wyth the heauenlye father in ioyes for euer) he is taken from vs now and can not healpe vs, and suche as in hys tyme,

semed muche to fououre the glory of God, are become Goddes enemyes, and can both heare other to proceede against the glorye of God, and also sette foorthe the same them selues as muche as they maye: So that suche spirituall and Godlye personnes as soughte in the fleshe Gods glory, are taken from vs, or els in suche case as they can do no good. And suche fleshe as folowed and loued God in the syght of the worlde, and hadde greate vauntage by his woorde, are become hys very enemies, and not only his, but also enemyes too hys members. But yet as kynge Dauyd knewe his foolyshe foly and wyth repentaunce repented and found grace: So it may please God to
                  •
                geue vs of his grace and holy spirit, to amende oure faultes in the lyke offences, and helpe vs as he did him. But doubtlesse greate is oure iniquitye. For there was neuer so greate abhomination redde of and so quickly to preuail, as this abhomination of the wicked masse hath preuailed in England. And al Christen

men know that the Turkes and hethen neither haue nor yet had euer any so sensiblye knowen, and many fest an idoll.
            Wherefore that almightye God of his mercye maye preserue his people in thys noble citye of London, I haue written vpon this. 23. psalme of kinge Dauid, to aduertise men how thei shal beware of

            The Texte.
            
               ¶The Lorde feedeth me and I shall want nothinge.
            
            The explanation.
            KYng Dauid saith the lord feedeth him: wherfore he can lack nothing to liue a vertuous and Godlye lyfe. In this first parte some thynges are to be consydered. First of God that feedeth, and nexte of man that is fedde. God that feedeth Dauid calleth by the name of a shepeheard, and his people he calleth by the name of sheepe. By this name of a shephearde the prophete openeth and disclosethe the nature of God to all his miserable and lost creatures, that he is contente not onely to wish and desire manne that is loste, to be founde and restored agayne, but also doth seke and trauayle to restore and bringe hym home agayne: As it is written in Esay the porphet,Esa. 40. he shall

gather togeyther hys lambes in hys arme. And in Ezechiell the prophet the lord sayth,Ezech. 44. behold I wyl requyre my flocke of the sheepeheardes. &c. And I wyll delyuer my slocke frome theyr mouthe, and they shall be no more their meate, for thus sayth the Lorde: beholde I wyll searche oute my sheepe, and wyll vysit them as a shepehearde doeth visite hys sheepe, when he is in the myddes of his scattered sheepe, so wyll I visit my shepe and delyuer them frome all places where as they haue bene scattered. &c And Ieremy the prophet in the same sorte declareth the nature of God towards the loste flocke,Iere. 31. saying: he that despersed Israel shall gather him together agayne and keepe him as the shepehearde kepeth his flocke. Christ our sauiour nameth him selfe a good shepehearde, and sayeth that he was sent to call such as were not sheepe of the vtt

                  . 10. to be his shepe. This nature of the heauenly father saw kinge Dauid, when he said at the beginninge of this heauenly

himn
                  •
               : The lord feedeth me &c.
            When he is assured of Gods mercifull nature that seketh the lost shepe, he openeth farther the nature of god, what he will do w̄t the shepe, which he findeth: feade hym sayth the prophet Dauid, and putteth him selfe for an exsample. Here is the mercye of the great sheepehearde farther declared, that he killeth not his shepe, robbe
                  •
               h them not, but seedeth and nourisheth them. Of this speaketh the prophet Ezechiell in the parson of almightye God:Ezech. 34. I my selfe wyll feede my shepe and make that they shall rest quietly, saieth the Lorde God. That whiche is lost I wil seeke, such as go astray I wyl bringe agayn, such as be wounded I wyl binde vp, such as be weake I wil make strong, but such as be fat & strong those wil I roote out, & I wil feede my shepe in reason & iudgemēt. And the great shepeherd Christ saith,Ioh. 10. whether his shepe go in or oute they shal finde pa
                  •
               ture.
            After that this kynge hathe opened in this hymne, y• Gods nature is not

onelye to seeke the loste shepe, but also when he hath founde him to feede him, then he addeth in his hymne, after what sorte hee feedethe hym: So that I shall lacke nothinge, saith the prophete. Heare is the declaring of the greate shepeheardes pasture, wherewith he feedethe the flocke of his pasture. Christe expresseth the same wonderfullye in the openinge of hys offyce and doctryne vntoo the worlde in Sayncte Iohn sayinge: I came that they mighte haue lyfe and haue it moste aboundauntelye.Ioa. 10.4.6 And talkinge with the poore woman of Samaria

               olde her that the drinke he woulde geue her shoulde be water of life. And to y• capernattes he said yt meat which he wold geue them shuld worke eternall saluation. As theese properties be in God the shepeherd, (as the prophet hath marked) euen in the lyke sorte be the contrarye condicions in man the sheepe he speakethe of. For as the nature of God is too seeke, so is the nature of man to go a straye, As the p
                  •
               ophet saieth: I haue

strayed like a wandringe sheepe.psal. 119. Esa. 53. And euen so doeth Esaye write of al man kynde: All we haue erred (sayeth he) as sheepe goinge a straye. Christ our sauiour also in sainte Mathewe doth bewayle the people of the world that stray as shepe that had no shepeherd.Mat. 9. Saint Peter likewise sayth vnto his cuntremen that he wryteth vnto,1. Pet. 2. ye were as shepe that went a stray, but ye be conuerted now vnto the shepehearde and pastoure of your soules. And as the nature of man is to stray from God,3. regu. 22. so is it likewise to feede vppon all vnholsome and infected pastures: too beleeue euerye false prophet that canne doe nothinge but lye.Esa. 28. In the prophete Esay the Lorde sayeth, the nature of sheepe is too be deceaued, and theyr pastoures to be droncke, that nether knowe nor see the pastures of the woorde of God. And in the same prophete there is a most horrible plague vppon man for synne, for the pastoures shall be vnable to feede,Esa. 29. and all the food
                  •
                of lyfe shall be as a boke fas
                  •
                clasped, & shut.

This goinge a stray and seeding vpon euyll pasture,2. Thes., 2. is wonderfully set foorthe by Sainte Paule: for when men wyll not feede vppon the truth, it is Goddes iuste iudgemente they shoulde feede vppon falsehode. And as Goddes nature is not onelye too feede but fullye to satisfye and to replenyshe wyth all goodnesse, so that nothynge maye lacke for a Godlye and vertuous life:Ioa. 4.6. In lyke manner the nature of manne is not onelye to feede but also to replenyshe it selfe with al infected and contagious doctrine,Rom. 1. vntyll suche time that he despise and contemne God and all hys holesome lawes. This we maye see in yt holy prophet Esay.Esa. 30. The people sayth the Lorde, prouoketh me vnto anger, a lyinge nacion that wyll not hear the law of god, they say to theyr prophetes prophecye not, looke not oute for vs things y• be right, speake pleasaunt thynges vnto vs, &c. And thys replenishynge of manne wyth corrupt pasture,Iho. 7. is horribly set foorth in Saincte Iohn when the wycked

priestes and phariseis would not beleue the shepeheardes voyce Christe, no not theyr owne seruauntes that tolde them the truth, nor yet Nycodemus one of their owne courte and profession. Thus in the fyrst part of this celestiall hymne is the nature of God and manne described vnder the name of a shepehearde and of sheepe.
            Of this parte of the psalme what the prophet hath sayed of God and of man,What is to benoted out of this part of y• psalme we must for our owne doctrine and learninge gather some things to be the better by.Rom. 15. For Sayncte Paul sayeth, what so euer is wrytten, is written for oure learninge. Two thinges we learne of this fyrst place: The one a certaintye that God hath the cure and charge of vs. And the other a consolation and comforte, that we and all oures be vnder his protection and gouernaunce. The first doctryne too be certayne and sure of Goddes defence, and care ouer vs, makethe vs constante and stronge to suffer and beare all aduersityes and troubles that God shall sende vs.

And the seconde doctrine shall cause vs patientlye and thanckefullye too beare our crosse and to folow Christ. Bothe these doctrines the prophette Dauyd expressethe in the. 3. and 4. verse of this psalme: If I should sayeth hee, traua

                  ••
               e prophet vnderstandeth all kynde of euyls that maye come vnto vs by the meanes of the deuil, or of wicked men. And these thinges the faythfull shall escape (sayeth the prophete) because they saye from their harts vnto God, Quoniam tu es spes mea, that is to saye, for thou art my hope: euen as hee sayed in the begynnynge of this psalme,The assuraunce of goddes defence and comfort in troubles must be learned out of gods word. the Lorde feedeth me and I shall wante nothinge.

But of what arte, facultye, science or kinde of liuinge so euer he be, that is not contrarye to Gods honour or honestye, he may vse therin to serue God, to obserue iustice, to excercise truth, kepe temperaunce & be acceptable to God, who hath geuē lawes meete & conuenient to publycanes and soldiours, seruaunts & masters, parents and children, husbands and wiues, and so to all other: but al these sortes of people must assuredly

And in dede the lorde hath not onely said, he wyll feede and defende hym from all daungers, but also sayth he wyll teache him how too liue veriuouslye and reuerently towards god, and honestlye and quietlye towardes man, what state or vocation so euer he chuse to liue in, so it be not against Gods lawes and the lawe of nature. So saith kinge Dauid:psal. 25. God hath appointed a lawe to rule and teache the man yt feareth him what so euer kind of liuinge he appointeth him selfe to liue in. What treasure is there to be compared vnto this, that man is not only fed and maintained by God, but also taughte and instructed in euerye craft & science that he apointeth him selfe to liue in?

            In this part of the psalme be manye things worthy to be noted. First it is declared, that the lyfe of manne consisteth in the foode of gods word: then that there is none that geeueth the worde to be eaten, but God oure heauenlye shepehearde. The nexte, that none canne rate of this meate of gods word, but such as the holi ghost feedeth with the woorde.Mat. 4. Our sauiour Christ declareth that man lyueth not by bread alone but of euery word that proceedeth oute of the mouth of God.We can no more liue in God without Godes word, then in the world withoute worldly foode. Whereby he teacheth vs that as the bodye liueth by externall meates, so doth the soule by the word of god. And no more possible is it for a man to lyue in God withoute the word of God, then in the worlde wythoute

the meat of the world. And S. Peter confessethe the same.Iohn. 6. For when the Caparnaites and manye of Christes owne disciples has sa

               mitte to hys dyet, but departed as hongry as they came, thorowe theyr owne folye. Christe was leadinge them from the fyue barley loues and two fyshes wherewith they had fylled theyr bellyes vnto the pleasaunt, pastures of the heauenly worde that shewed neyther barley loues nor fishe, but his owne precious bloude and paynfull passion to be the meate of theyr soules: howe

gone astraye, bye his wicked wayes and sinfull manner of liuynge. If he were an infidele, he bringeth him first to know, feele, & hate his infidelity, and afterwardes to a true faith. If he be a persecutour, he sheweth him first his tyrānye, and afterwards how to vse him selfe meekelye. If he be a sinfull man that liueth contrary to his knowledge & professiō, he bringeth him first to the knowledge & hatred of his syn, and afterwards to the forgeuenes of y• same. As Christ our sauyour wonderfully teacheth in S. Iohn,Ioh. 16. wher he satih: The holy ghost when he commeth shall rebuke the worlde of synne, iustyce, and iudgemente. By the whiche wordes he declareth that the faythfull of God, can not profyt in the gospel of Christ, nether loue nor exercise iustice and vertue, excepte they be taughte, and made too feele the burden and daunger of synne, and be brought to humble them selues as menne that be of them selues nothinge but synne.

               tyes:Psal. 32 And therefore he sayeth in the seconde verse of the psalme aboue mencioned, blessed is he to whom the Lorde imputeth no synne, and in whose spirite there is no guyle. For there is no geater guyle, nor more daunger in man than to thynke hym selfe to be somewhat when he is nothinge in dede, or elles to thinke hym selfe to be of such purity of mynd, as thoughe he needed not thys free remission and fauoure of God. And as there is nothinge more proude and arrogant, then such a mind: so ther is nothing in man more detestable and miserable. Of the contrary part, they be blessed that honger and thurst for iustice, for God fylleth the hongrye with good thyngs,Mat. 5. Luc 1. but the proude he sendethe a waye emptye. And that knewe this holy prophet right well, that it was humility and the casting doune of him selfe y• was most acceptable

vnto God, and the seekinge of wealth and saluation onelye for hys names sake, that is too saye, for his mercye promysed in the deathe and passion of his onely sonne oure sauioure Christe. In the ende of the. xxxii psalme kinge Dauid that hadde thus humbled hym selfe, bringeth in god that speaketh vnto him whyles he is thus makinge his complaynte of his corrupte nature and synfull lyfe, saying in this maner, intellectum tibi dabo &c. that is to say, I wyll geue thee vnderstandinge, and instructe thee in the waye thou shalte go, and wyll haue myne eyes euer vppon thee. Wherin he declareth that such humbled menne and lowelye persons as knowe theyr iniquitye, shall haue vnderstandinge of God, and shal not swarue from the right waies: not for theyr dedes and their deseruings, but for his mercye that vouchsafeth to instruct and teach thē. And so lykewise doeth this godlye kinge shew in this psalme: The Lorde rulethe me and I lacke nothynge, he

When he hathe opened the saluation of manne, and also the cause thereof and wherein it consisteth: he procedeth to the v. parte of his oration and holy himne.

            ¶The explanation.
            SEinge I haue suche a guyde and defendour, ther is no difficultye of perryll, nor feare of death, that I wyll passe of. For what harme can death do to him, that hath God the authoure of all lyfe wyth

In this first parte kynge Dauid sheweth how the Lorde God doeth exercise his shepe that he fedeth with his blessed worde, in daungers and troubles, and also howe he wyll defende them in the myddes of theyr troubles what so euer they bee. In the firste wordes of the. v. parte of this sacrate and holye hymne the prophet declareth that the lyfe of Gods sheepe and people in thys worlde canne not bee wythonte daungers and troubles. Therefore Christ sayth that he came too

               ynte the prophet correcteth the foolishe opinonion of manne that would lyue as one of the sheepe of God in thys world wythoute troubles. It is contrarye both to the personne that professeth God, and also to the religion that he is professed vntoo, for in the worlde bothe shall be as Christe sayeth hated. Of whych hatred cometh persecution and troubles, so that the people of God shall whether they wyll or wyll not, passe throughe

manye daungers, and no lesse perylous then the shadowes, and verye ymage of death, as here kinge Dauid sheweth in this hoolsome and blessed hymne.
            And as he seeth righte well that the state and condicion of Gods people and shepe,Zacha. 13. Mat. 16. is too be troubled for Christes sake and his woorde: Euen so dyd Zacharye the prophet speake of Christ and his people, howe that not onelye the shepe shoulde be troubled and scattered abroade, but also the shepehearde shoulde be strycken with the swearde, that bothe sheepe and shepehearde shoulde be condemned in this world. But nowe as Dauid and Zac

then the heauenlye shepehearde shal appoynte them to doo. And this we may see and learne as well in Christ as in hys sheepe. How manye tymes dyd the priestes and Phariseys conspyre Christes death? Yet because his tyme was not come, they hadde not theyr purpose: but when the tyme of God was come, Christe sayed too his sheepe, ye shall be all troubled this night for my cause, for the shepe
               
                  •
               earde shall bee strycken and the sheepe shall bee scattered abroade. Then as God hadde appoynted the tyme, it could be no longer differred. And because they shoulde not mysse of hym whose death they sought,Ioh. 18. he

Therfore did Dauid both know, speake, and feele signed in his harte, the faucure, healpe and assistaunce of God to be with him in too what troubles so euer he should fall, and in that feelinge sayde he woulde not fear. But it may fortune I haue so written of vertue & vice to be knowen of in the mynde, spoke of with

the mouth, and feite in the hart: that ye may iudge and fele in your selues, neuer to haue come to this perfectiō. For this is out of doubt, he that hath gods loue and fear thus sealed in his hart, liueth in this life rather an Angelicall life, then the life of a mortall mā: & yet it is euident by king Dauid in thys psalme, & by his. 111. psalme, & in manye more, that he was so sure & so wel ascertained of Gods presente helpe in his troubles, that hes cared nothinge for death, or anye other aduersityes y• could happen. And doutlesse we perceaue by his psalmes in many places, that his faith was a
                  •
                stronge as steele, and he trembled not nor doubted anye thinge, but was in maner without all kind of mistrust, & nothing troubled whatsoeuer he saw contrarye to gods promises, and he passed ouer thē as thinges that could not once withdrawe his cogitacions frō the truth & verity of gods promises which he beleued. As Abrahā likewise did, he staggered not but wt constancy of faith would haue killed his

sonne,Gene. 22 so stronge was his fayth. But as the gifte of fayeth is a treasure incomparable, thus to know and feele fayth too ouercome all daungers: so maketh it yt hart of him that is sealed with suche a faith to feele the ioyes & mirth vnspeakable. But as this faith is the gift of god & cometh only from him: so is it in him only to apoint the tyme when it shall come, and howe muche and howe strongly it shall bee geuen at all tymes, whiche is not at all tyme

But yet it is wyth muche conflycte, greate troubles, manye heauye and meruaylouse cogytacions, and some tyme with suche a feare, as the man hath muche a doo to see, and feele in the later ende of his heauye conflicte the victory and vpper hand of the temptation. And at an other

tyme the Christian man shall fynde suche heauines, oppression of synne, and troubles,The state of Gods chyldren beaten down with the sense & horroure of sin & dreede of gods iudgemente

                that he shall not feele as muche (in manner) as one sparke of fayeth to comforte him selfe in the trouble of hys mynd (as he thinketh) but that all the flouds and dreadefull assaultes of desperacion haue theyr course thorowe his conscyence. Nothyng feeleth he, but his owne mind and poore conscyence so one too eate the other, that the conflicte is more payne to him then death it selfe, hee vnderstandeth that god is bable to do all thinges, he confesseth wyth the knowledge of his mynde, and wyth his tonge in his headde that God is true and mercifull, he woulde haue his conscyence and hearte too agree thereunto and be quyet, but the conscience is prycked and oppressed so muche wyth feare and doubtefuldes of Gods tre for synne, that he thincketh God can be mercifull vnto other but not vntoo him. And thus doeth his knowledge for the tyme of temptation, rather trouble him then ease

him, because his harte doeth not or rather can not consent vnto the knowledge; yet woulde he rather then his lyfe, he could consent vnto god, loue god, hate synne, and be Gods altogether, althoughe he suffered for it all the paynes of the worlde.

This worde table is diuerslye other wayes taken many tymes in the scripture, but in this place it is nearest too the mynde of kinge Dauid, to take it in this signification that I haue noted: And oure sauioure Christe taketh it in the same signification, in Saints Lukes gospell where he sayeth, his dysciples shall eate wyth him at hys table in the kingdome of god.
            The fourth meanes that the heauenlye shepehearde vseth in kepinge of his sheepe, the prophete setteth foorth vnder the name of oyle and a full cuppe. In the word of God these

wordes haue also comofrtable significations and meaninges extendinge to Dauids purpose. Isaac when hee had geuen the blessinge frome Esau to Iacob, sayde to Iacob, God shall geue the of the dewe frome heauen, and from the frutefull grounde thou shalte haue abundaunce of corne,Gene. 27. of wyne, and oyle &c. By the whyche blessinge he meatne that Iacob shuld lacke nothinge too serue his needes, and to make him merye. And if wee take Dauid that he meaneth by oyle, as Isaac did, that at the Lordes table was all plentye, myrthe and solace, we take him not amysse, for so manye tymes oyle is taken for consolatiō and ioy in the scripture. When Christe had pourged the hurte mans woundes first with smartinge wine, be afterwardes put in to them swete oyle to ease the smarte and sharpenes of the wine And so likewise saith our sauioure Christe to Simon the Pharisey that gaue him meate enoughe to his dinner but gaue him no mirth:Luc. 10 Synce I came in too thy house thou

gauest me no water for my feete, nor oyle for my headde, this poore woman neuer ceassed to washe my feete wyth the teares of her eyes,Luc. 7. and to
                  •
                anoynte them wyth oyle. But in manye psalmes kinge Dauyd vsethe this worde oyle too signifye the holy ghoste, as when he speaketh of oure Sauioure Christe: Thou haste loued iustice and hated iniquitye,Psal. 45. therfore hathe God anoynted thee wyth the oyle of ioye aboue thy fellowes. And this oyle is not y• materiall oyle that kings and priestes wer anointed with al in the olde time of the law, of whose cōfeccion we reade in the boke of the Leuites but this is the oyle by whose efficacy, strength, and power all thinges were made, that is to say the holy ghost: And in his. 89. psalme he speaketh of oyle in the same signification. Therfore I take kinge Dauyd here, when he sayeth God hath anoynted his headde with oyle, that God hathe illuminated hys spiryte with the holye ghoste. And so is thys place taken of godlye men, his heade

taken for his mynde, and oyle for the holye ghost. And as oyle nourishe the lyghte mytigateth labours and paines, and exhilerateth the countenaunce:The worc

                     •
                  . as Saincte Peter saith: we be people chosen and a princely priesthode &c. By the word cuppe in this verse he meaneth that hee is fulley instructed in all Godlye knowledge, too liue ver
                  •
               uouselye and Godlye for the tyme of his mortall life, and so is the cup in the scripture takē for any thing that can happen vnto vs, whether it be aduersitye or prosperity, for they be called cups: As Christe sayde of his deathe,Mut. 2
                     •
                  
                father if it bee possyble take this cuppe frō me. And Dauid in the. 16 psalme

vseth it for mans prosperity in God: The Lorde (sayeth he) is the porcion of myne enheritance, and of my cup. And therein he speaketh in the name of Christe, whose inheritaunce is the whole number of the fayethfull, and sayth, that his enheritaunce which is the churche, by Gods appoyntment is blessed and happye, for no aduersitye can destroye it. This is meante by, Dauids woordes, the rodde, the staffe, the table, the oyle, and the cuupe, and he vseth all these wordes to declare the carefulnes, loue, and defence of God towardes miserable man. And he coulde the better speake thereof vntoo others, because he had so manye tymes 
                  •
               ealte, and had experience that God was both stronge and fayethfull towardes hym in all tyme of daunger and aduersity.
            And here is to be noted that the daū
               gers that man is subiect vnto in this lyfe, be not alone suche as heretofore kinge Dauid hath made mencion of, as sickenes, treason, sedicion, warre, pouertye, banishmente, and the death

of the bodye, but he fealte also (as euerye man of god shall feele and perceaue) that there be greater periles and daungers that man standeth in ieopardye of, then these be, by occasion of synne, the mother of all mans aduersity.What sinne bryngethe a man vnto Synne bringeth a manne in to the displeasure and indignation of god, y• indignation of god bringeth a man in to ye hatred of god, ye hatred of god bringeth a mā in to despaire & doubtfulnes of gods forgeuenes, dyspaire bringeth a mā in to euerlasting pain, & euerlasting payne continueth and punisheth the damned creature wyth fier neuer to be quenched, with Gods anger and displeasure whiche can not be reconciled nor pacified.
            These be the troubles of all troubles, and sorowes of all sorowes, as oure sauioure Christ declareth in his most heauenlye prayer in Saynt Iohn:Ioh. 17. 
               Non rog

Wherein he speaketh not onelye of battayle wyth the sword agaynst the bodye, but also of heresye and false doctrine agaynste the soule. As ye maye see how Senacharib and Iulius the apostata, two emperours, fought against the people of god, not only to take from them theyr liues: but also theyr religion and true honouringe of god. And of all battayls that is the cruelest, and of all enemies the principall, that would take the soule of man from gods worde and bringe it to the word of man. And that persecution & trouble openly against gods word continued manye yeares, vntyl Christe was preached abroade, and princes made christians. Then thought the deuyll his kingdome to haue ben overthrowen, and christian men might liue in Christes religion withoute any trouble or warre for religion. How be it at length for sinne, the deuyll entred by subtyll meanes, not

onelye to corrupte true religion, but also persecuted the true professoures thereof vnder the name of true religion, and therein vsed a meruailous policye and crafte by men that walked inordinatelye amonges the christians them selues.

Of the which deadly and pestilente ambition,Ezech. 34. Act. 20 the prophet Ezechiel prophesied, & so did also S. Paul, if prophecies by god and commaundementes by hys holye Apostles had anye thinge preuayled in oure dull and naughty hartes.

            The greke church for this ambition of the Romyshe bishop, seperated her selfe frome the churche of Rome, and woulde not haue to do with her. For after that the grekes knew, that the bishops of Rome, meante to take from them their liberties, they wold not indure it: yet dyd the Romish bishops alwayes, to come to the supremacy, pycke quarrelles and matters to fall out vppon, fyrst with the clargye and then with the laity. Platina writeth howe Pius bishop of Rome being deceaued by one Hermes a verye

euyll man, began a new order aboute the kepinge of Ester daye, and altered the tyme y• the Apostles and theyr disciples vsed vntyll Pius daies, which was to celebrate and kepe the daie of the resurrection of our sauioure Christe the. 14. Moone of the first moneth, which is with the Iewes our march. And althoughe it be wel done to kepe it vpon the sonday, yet was this an hortible presumption vpon so light a cause, to excōmucate the greeke churche, and to make diuision where before was vnion. It came too passe in Uictors tyme the first, whiche was aboute the yeare of our Lorde. 200. and in the time of Ireneus the bishoppe of Lugdune the disciple of Iohn the Euangelist, this Uictor woulde haue condemned the greke church, and proceeded with excōmunication agaynst it, had not Ireneus letted it: yet was it the elder churche, and hadde continued in the doctrine of the Apostles, frō Christs tyme, and had Iohn the Euangelist amonges them for the space of. 68.

yeares after Christes assension. And notwythstandinge the greeke church was the elder churche: yet they tooke the Romayne churche too be equall with them, according to the doctrine of Christe and his Apostles, and also accordinge too the decree that was made in the general councel at Nice. And the greke church neuer contended wyth the Romyshe churhe for the supremacye, vntyll a proude and arrogante moncke that

Phocas was a wicked man, a couetous man, an adulterer,Platina in bonifac. 3. and a traiterous murderer of his lorde and master Mauricius: and this man to make god and the Romains amends,Paulus dioconus de gestis Long. lib. 4. cap. 11 gaue sentence that the bishop of Rome shuld be the vniuersall heade of the church.

So that it is manifest this superiour preeminence is not of Gods lawes,

but of mannes, instituted for a ciuil policye: and so was the churche of Constantynople equall wyth the church of Rome. And in our dates Erasmus Roterodame wrytethe and sayeth, this name to be highe bishop of the world

fote for the Emperoure of Constantinople farther then hee serued his turne. So that ye maye see both his beginnynge and procedinges to be of the deuil, which if ye kil not with the staffe of Gods worde, and beate him frome your conscience, he wyll double kill youre soules.
            Now within 150 yeares after Phocas had made the bishoppe of Rome heade of the churche, the bishoppe of Rome centemned the Emperour of Constantinople, & deuised to bringe the Empire in to Fraunce, and too geue the kinge of Fraunce the same autoritye ouer the bishop of Rome y• before the Emperour had, as it apeareth in Charles the great and his successours a longe time: and yet was ye bishop of Rome vnder the princes & not (as he is now) an idoll exempt frō all order and obedience.
