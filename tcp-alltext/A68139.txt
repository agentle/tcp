Thus one gotte a bagge of Cheeſe the laſt Sturbridge Faire, for in ſuch places (as a reclaimd fellow of that crue confeſſed) they make an ordinary practiſe of the ſame.

            THE GROVNDWORKE of Conny-catching.
            
               The Viſiter.
               
                  AN honeſt youth not many yeares ſince, ſeruant in this City, had leaue of his maſter at whitſontide to ſee his friends who dwelt ſome fifty miles from London. It hapned at a Country wake, his mother and hee came acquainted with a preciſe ſcholler, that vnder colour of ſtrickt life, hath bin reputed for that hee is not: hee is well knowen in Paules Churchyard, and hath beene lately a viſiting in Eſſex (for ſo he preſumes to tearme his coſening walks: and therefore wee will call him here a Viſiter. This honeſt ſeeming man muſt needes (ſith his iourney lay to London) ſtay at the yong mans mothers all the holy daies: where as on his deſert hee was kindly vſed: at length, the young man hauing receiued his mothers bleſſing, with other his friendes giftes amounting to ſome ten poundes, was to this hypocrite as to a faithful guide committed, and toward London they ride: by the way this Viſiter diſcourſes how excellent inſight he had in Magick, to recouer by Art any thing loſt or ſtolne. Well to ſant Albons they reach, there they ſup together, and after the carowſing of ſome quarts of wine they go to bed where they kindly ſleepe, the Viſiter ſlily, but the young man ſoundly: Short tale to make out of his bedfellows ſleeue, this Viſiter conuaid his twenty Angels beſides ſome other od ſiluer, hid it cloſely, and ſo fell to his reſt. Morning comes, vp get this couple, immediately the money was miſt, much adoo was made the Chamberlaine with ſundry other ſeruants examined, and ſo hot the contention, that the goodman for the diſcharge of his houſe was ſending for a Conſtable to haue them both firſt ſearcht, his ſeruants Cheſts after. In the meane time the Viſiter cals the yong man aſide, and bids him neuer grieue but take horſe, and he warrants him ere they be three miles out of towne to helpe him to his money by Art, ſaying. In theſe Innes ye ſee how we ſhall be out faced, and beeing vnknowne, how euer we be wrongd get litle remedy: the yong man in good hope deſired him to pay the reckoning, which done together they ride. Being ſome two miles from the towne, they ride out of the ordinary way: there he tels this youth, how vnwilling hee was to enter into the action, but that it was loſt in his company, and ſo forth. Well a Circle was made, wondrous words were vſed, many muttrings made at length hee cries out, vnder a

With that this ſhifter ſaid, Go to the furtheſt Oke in the high way towards S. Albons, and vnder a greene turre on the hither ſide lyes your mony, and a note of his name that ſtole it. Hence I cannot ſtirre till you returne, neyther may either of our horſes be vntide for that time, runne yee muſt not▪ but keepe an ordinary pace. Away goes the yong man gingerly, and being out of ſight, this copeſmate takes his cloke

               A Shifter.
               A Shifter not long ſince going ordinarily booted, got leaue of a Carrier to ride on his owne hackney a little way from London, who comming to the

                  e, and being Gentleman-like attirde, he was at all their inſtance placed at the vpper end by the hoſteſſe. After hee had a while eaten he fel to diſcourſe with ſuch pleaſance, that all the table were greatly delighted therewith. In the midſt of ſupper enters a noiſe of muſitions, who with their inſtruments added a double delight. For them hee requeſted his hoſteſſe to laye a ſhoulder of mutton and a couple of capons to the fire, for which he would pay, & then mooued in their behalfe to gather. Among them a noble was made, which he fingring, was well bleſt, for before he had not a croſſe, yet he promiſt to make it vp an angel. To be ſhort, in comes the reckoning, which (by reaſon of the fi
                     •
                  e fare & exceſſe of wine amounted to each mans halfe crown. Then hee requeſted his hoſteſſe to prouide ſo many poſſets of ſacke as would furniſh the table, which he would beſtow on the Gentlemen, to requite their extraordinary coſts: & 
                     •
                  eſtingly aſkt if ſhe would make him her deputie to gather the reckoning ſhe graunted and he did ſo: and on a ſodaine (faining to haſten his hoſteſſe with the poſſets) he tooke his cloke, and finding fit time hee ſlipt out of doores, leauing the gueſtes and their hoſteſſe to a new reckoning, & the Muſitians to a good ſupper, but they paid for the ſauce. This teſt ſome vntruly attribute to a man of excellent parts about London but he is ſlandered: the party that performed it hath ſcarce any good qualitie to liue. Of theſe ſort & could ſet downe a great number, but I leaue you now vnto thoſe which by Maiſter Harman are diſcouered.

Henry the eight late of moſt famous memorie: he ſhall be firſt placed as the worthieſt of this vnruly rabblement. And hee is ſo called when he goeth firſt abroad, either he hath ſerued in the warres, or elſe he hath beene a ſeruingman, and wearie of well dooing, and ſhaking off all paine, doth chuſe him this idle life and wretchedly wanders about the moſt ſhires of this realme. And with ſtout audacitie, he demaundeth where he may be bolde, and circumſpect inough, as he ſeeth cauſe to aſke charitie, rufully and lamentably, that it would make a flinty heart to relent, and pitie his miſerable eſtate, how he hath bene maymed & bruſed in the warres, and peraduenture ſome will ſhew ſome outwarde wound, which hee gotte at ſome drunken fray, either halting of ſome priuie wound feſtered with a fiery f

                   of their friends, they will ſurely deſperatly rob and ſteale, and either ſhortly be hanged, or miſerably die in priſon: for they bee ſo much aſhamed and diſdaine to begge or aſke charitie, that they wil as deſperately fight for to liue and maintaine themſelues, as manfully and valiauntly they ventured themſelues in the Princes quarrell. Now theſe Rufflars, the out-caſts of ſeruing-men, when begging or crauing failes, then they picke and pylfer from other inferiour beggers that they meet by the way, as Roges, Pallyards, Mortes, and Doxes. Yea if they meet with a woman alone riding to the market, eyther olde man or boy that hee well knoweth will not reſiſt, ſuch they

                  .
               
                  I had of late yeares an olde man to my tennant, who cuſtomably a great time went twiſe in the weeke to London, either with fruit or with peſcods, when time ſerued therefore: And as he was comming homeward on blacke-heath, at the end thereof next W Shooters hill, he ouertooke two Rufflars, the one mannerly waiting on the other as one had beene the maiſter, and the other the man, or ſeruant carrying his maiſters Cloke, this old man was very glad that he might haue their company ouer the hill, becauſe that he had made a good market, for he had ſeauen ſhillings in his purſe, and an old angell, which this poore man had thought had not beene in his purſe, for hee willed his wife ouer night to take out the ſame angell, and lay it vp vntill his comming home againe, And he verely thought that his wife had ſo done which indeede forgot to doe it, Thus after ſalutations, had this maiſter Rufflar entered into communication with this ſimple old man who riding ſoftly beſide them, commoned of many matters. Thus feeding this old man with pleaſant talke, vntill they were on the top of the hill, where theſe Rufflars might well behold the Coaſt about them cleare: Quickly ſteps vnto this poore man, and taketh hold on his horſe bridle, and leadeth him into the wood, and demaundeth of him what and how much money he had in his purſe. Now by my troth quoth this old man you are a merry gentleman, I know you meane not to take away any thing from me but rather to giue me ſome if I ſhould aſke it of you. By and by this ſeruant thiefe, caſteth the cloake that hee carried on his arme about this poore mans face, that he ſhould not marke or view them, with ſharpe words to deliuer quickely that he had and to confeſſe truely what was in his purſe. This poore man then all abaſhed yeelded, and confeſſed he had but iuſt ſeauen ſhillings in his purſe and the troth is he knew of no more, This old angell was fallen out of a little purſe into the bottome of a great purſe. Now this ſeauen ſhillings in white money they quickly found, thinking in deede that there had beene no more, yet farther groping and ſearching found this old angell. And with great admiration this gentleman thief began to bleſſe him ſaying, Good Lord what a world is this, how may (quoth he) a man beleeue or truſt in the ſame, ſe you not (quoth he) this old knaue he told me that hee had but ſeauen ſhillings, and heere is more by an angell, what an olde knaue and a falſe knaue haue we here quoth this Rufflar? Our Lord haue mercy on vs, will this world neuer bee better, and therewith went their way, and left the old man in the wood doing him no more harme. But ſorrowfully ſighing this olde man returning home declared his miſaduenture, with all the words

and circumſtaunces aboue ſhewed. Wherat for the time was great laughing, and this poore man for his loſſes among his louing neighbours well conſidered in the end.

My neuewes quoth the Parſon, I trow thou art mad, nay by God quoth this good wife, as ſober as you, for they told me faithfully that you were their vncle, but in faith are ye not ſo indeed, for by my troth they are ſtrangers to me, I neuer ſaw them before. O out vpon them, quoth the Parſon, they bee falſe theeues, and this might they compelled me to giue them all the money in my houſe. Benedicite quoth this good wife, and haue they ſo indeed? as I ſhal anſwer before God, one of them told mee beſides that you were Godfather to him, and that hee truſted to haue your bleſſing before he departed. What did hee quoth this Parſon? a halter bleſſe him for mee: mee thought by your countenance, you looked ſo wildly when you came in quoth

this good wife, that ſomething was amiſſe. I vſe not to ieſt ſaid the Parſon in ſo earneſt a matter. Why all your ſorrowes got with it ſaid the good wife, ſit downe, and I will fill a freſh potte of Ale ſhall make you merry againe. Yea ſaid the Parſon, fill in, and giue me ſome meat, for they made me ſweare and promiſe them faithfully that I ſhould drinke twelue pence with you to day. What did they quoth ſhe, now by the maſſe they be merrie knaues, I warrant you they mean to buy no land with the money: but how could they come into you in the night, your doores being ſhut faſt your houſe is very ſtrong. Then he ſhewed her all the whole circumſtance, how he gaue them his almes out at the window, they made ſuch lamentable crie that it pittied him at the hart: for he ſaw but one when he put his hand out at the window. Be ruled by me ſaid the wife: wherin quoth the Parſon? by my troth neuer ſpeake more of it, when they ſhal vnderſtand of it in the pariſh, they will but laugh you to ſcorne. Why then quoth this Parſon, the deuill go with it, and there an end,
            
            
               A wilde Roge. Cap. 5.
               
                  A Wilde Roge is he that is borne a Roge, he is more ſubtill, and more giuen by nature to all kinde of knauery than the other, as beaſtly begotten in barne or buſhes, and from his infancie traded in tretcherie, yea and before ripeneſſe of yeares doth permit, wallowing in leude lecherie, but that is counted no ſinne. For this is their cuſtome, that when they meete in a barne at night euerie one getteth a make to lie withal although there chaunce to bee twentie in a companie, as there is ſometimes more, and ſometimes leſſe: for to one man that goeth abroad, there are at the leaſt two women, which neuer make it ſtrange when they be called, although ſhee neuer knew him before. Then when the day doth appeare, he rowſes himſelfe, and ſhakes his eares, and away goes wandering where he may get ought to the hurt of others. Yet before hee ſkippeth out of his couch, and departeth from his darling, if hee like her well▪ hee will appoint her where to meet him ſhortly after, with a warning to worke warily for ſome chetes, that their meeting might be the merrier.
               ¶Not long ſithens a wild Roge chaunced to meete a poore neighbor of mine, who for honeſtie and good nature ſurmounteth many. This poore man riding homeward from London, where he had made his market, this roge demanded a penie for Gods ſake to keepe him a true man. This ſimple man behelde him well, ſeeing him of tall perſonage, and a good quarter ſtaffe

in his hand, it much pittied him as he ſaid to ſee him want, for he was well able to ſerue his Prince in the warres. Thus being moued in pittie, he looked in his purſe to finde out a pennie, and in looking for the ſame, he plucked out eight ſhillings in ſliuer and raked therein to find a ſingle penny, and at the laſt finding one, doth of
                     •
                  er the ſame to this wild roge: but he ſeeing ſo much money in this ſimple mans hande, beeing ſtriken to the heart with a couetous deſire, bid him forthwith deliuer all that he had, or elſe he would with his ſtaffe beat out his braines. For it was not a penny would now quench his thirſt ſeeing ſo much as hee did, thus ſwallowing his ſpittle greedily downe, ſpoyled this poore man of all the money that he had, and leapt ouer the hedge into a thicke wood, and went his way as merely, as this good ſimple man came home ſorowfully. I once rebuking a wild roge becauſe he went idlely about, he ſhewed me that he was a begger by inheritance, his Grandfather was a begger, his father was one, and he muſt needs be one by good reaſon.
            
            
               A Prigger of Prauncers. Cap. 6.

Theſe go commonly in Ierkins of leather or white freeze, & cary litle wands in their hands, and will walke through grounds and paſtures to ſearch & ſee horſes meet for their purpoſe. And if they chance to be met and aſked by the owners of the ground what they do there, they feigne ſtraight that they haue loſt their way and deſire to be inſtructed the beſt way to ſuch a place. Theſe wil alſo repaire to Gentlemens houſes, and aſke their charity, and wil offer their ſeruice: and if you aſke them what they can doe, they will ſay that they can keepe three or foure Geldings, and waite vpon a Gentleman. Theſe haue alſo their women, that walking from them in other places, marke where and what they ſee abroad, and ſhew theſe Priggars thereof when they meete, which is within a weeke or two. And looke where they ſteale any thing, they conuey the ſame at the leaſt threeſcore miles off the place.
               ¶There was a Gentleman a verie friend of mine, riding from London homeward into Kent, hauing within three miles of his owne houſe buſineſſe, who alighted off his horſe, and his man alſo, in a prettie village where diuers houſes were, and looked about him where he might haue a conuenient perſon to walke his horſe, becauſe hee would ſpeake with a Farmer

that dwelt on the backeſide of the ſaide village, little aboue a quarter of a mile from the place where he lighted, and had his man to wait vpon him, as it was meete for his calling: eſpying a begger there ſtanding, thinking the ſame to dwell there, charging this pretty prigging perſon to walke his horſe well, and that they might not ſtand ſtill for taking of colde, and at his returne (which he ſaide ſhould not bee long) he would giue him a penny to drinke, and ſo went about his buſines. This pelting Priggar proud of his pray, walketh his horſe vp and downe till he ſaw the gentleman out of ſight, and leapes into the ſaddle, and away hee goeth a maine. This Gentleman returning, and finding not his horſes, ſent his man to the one ende of the village and he went himſelf vnto the other end, and inquired as he went for his horſes that were walked and began ſomewhat to ſuſpect, becauſe neither he nor his man could ſee or finde him. Then this gentleman dilligently inquired of three or foure towne dwellers there, whether any ſuch perſon, declaring his ſtature, age, apparrell, with ſo many lineaments of his body as he could call to remembrance. And vna voce all ſaid that no ſuch man dwelt in their ſtreete, neither in the pariſh that they knew of, but ſome did well remember that ſuch a one they ſawe there lurking and huggering two houres, before the gentleman came thither, but he was a ſtranger vnto them. I had thought quoth this gentleman he had here dwelled, and ſo being not farre from home, he marched mannerly in his boots, I ſuppoſe at his comming home he ſent ſuch waies as he ſuſpected or thought meete to ſearch for this Prigger, but hitherto hee neuer heard any tydings againe of his Palfries. I had the beſt gelding ſtolen out of my paſture which & had going amongſt others while this booke was firſt a printing.

Alſo if the ſame briefe be in print, it is alſo of authoritie: for the Printers will ſee and well vnderſtand before it come in preſſe, that the ſame is lawfull. Alſo I am credibly informed that the chiefe Proctors of many of theſe houſes, that ſeldome trauell abroad themſelues but haue their factors to gather for them, which looke very ſlenderly to the impotent and miſerable creatures committed to their charge, and die for want of cherriſhing whereas they and their wiues are well crammed & cloathed, and will haue of the beſt. And the founders of euery ſuch houſe, or the chiefe of the pariſh where they bee, would better ſee vnto theſe Proctors, that they might doe their duety, they ſhould be well ſpoken of here, and in the worlde to come aboundantly therefore rewarded. I had of late an honeſt man, and of good wealth, repaired to my houſe to common with mee about certain affairs, I inuited him to dinner, and dinner being done. I demaunded of him ſome newes of theſe parties where hee dwelt. Thanks be to God ſyr (ſaith he) all is wel and good now. Now (quoth I) this ſame now declareth that ſome thinges of late hath not bin well. Yes ſyr (quod he) the matter is not great, I had thought I ſhould haue beene well beaten, within this ſeuen night, how ſo (quoth I) Mary ſyr ſaid he. I am Conſtable for falt of a better, & was commanded by the Iuſticer to watch.

The watch beeing ſet, I tooke an honeſt man one of my neighbours with mee, and went vp to the ende of the towne as far as the Spittle houſe, at which houſe I heard a great noyſe, and drawing neare ſtoode cloſe vnder the wall▪ and this was at one of the clocke after midnight, where I heard ſwearing, prating, and wagers laying, and the porte apace walking, and fortie pence gaged vppon a match of wraſtling, pitching of the Barre, and caſting o

Then the noyſe increaſed, the Conſtable would haue had them to the ſtockes, the wife of the houſe runnes out with her goodman to intreat the Conſtable for her gueſtes, and leaues the Pygge at the fire alone. In commeth two or three of the next neighbours, beeing waked with this noyſe, & looking round about the houſe, they could find nothing therein but the Pygge well r

And comming into their houſe againe, and finding the Pigge with bread and drink all gone, made a great exclamation, for they knew not who had the ſame.
               ¶The Conſtable returning, and hearing the lamentable wordes of the good wife, how ſhe had loſt both meat and drinke and ſaw it was ſo indeede, hee laughed in his ſleeue, and commaunded her to dreſſe no more at vnlawfull houres for anie of her gueſtes: for he thought it better beſtowed vppon thoſe ſmel

Some of theſe bee merry and very pleaſant, they will daunce and ſing, ſome others bee as colde and reaſonable to talke withall. Theſe begge money, or when they come at a Farmers houſe they will demaunde either Bacon, cheeſe, or wooll, or any thing that is worth money▪ and if they eſpie ſmall company within, they will with fierce countenance demaunde ſomewhat, where for feare the maides will giue them largely to be rid of them.
               ¶ If they may conueniently come by any cheate, they will picke and ſteale, as the vpright man or Rogue, poultry, or linnen, and all women that wander, be at their commandement. Of all that euer I ſaw of this kind, one naming himſelf Stradling, is the craftieſt and moſt diſſemblingeſt knaue. He is able with his tongue and vſage, to deceiue and abuſe the wiſeſt man that is: And ſurely for the proportion of his body, with euery member there vnto appertaining, it cannot be amended. But as the prouerbe is (God hath done his part.) This Stradling ſaith, he was the Lord Sturtons man, and when hee was executed, for very penſiuenes of minde he fell out of his wit, and ſo continued a yeare after and more and that with the very griefe and feare▪ hee was taken with a maruellous palſie, that both head and hands will ſhake, when he talketh with any, and that apace or faſt, whereby hee is much pittied, and getteth greatly. And if I had not demaunded of others both men and women, that commonly walketh as hee doth, and knowne by them, his

deepe diſſimulation, I neuer had vnderſtood the ſame. And thus I end with theſe kynde of vacabondes.

Sir ſaith he, I was borne at Leyceſter, my name is Nicholas Gennings, and I haue had this falling ſickneſſe eight yeeres, and I can get no remedy for the ſame, for I haue it by kind, my father had it and my friends before me, and I haue beene theſe two yeeres here about London, and a yere and a halfe in Bedlam: why waſt thou out of thy wits quoth I? yea ſir yt I was▪ What is the Keepers name of the houſe: his name is quoth he, Iohn Smith.

My ſeruant returning to my lodging, did aſſure mee that neither was there euer any ſuch man there, neither yet any keeper of any ſuch name, but he that was there keeper ſent me his name in writing, affirming that he letteth none depart from him vnleſſe he be ſet away by his frends, and that none that came from him begged about the Cittie. Then ſent I for the Printer of this booke, and ſhewed him of this diſſembling Crank, and how I had ſent to Bedlam to vnderſtand the truth, and what aunſwere I receyued againe, requiring

To be ſhort, there he paſſed all the day till night approched, and when it began to be ſomewhat darke, he went to the waterſide, and tooke a Skuller and was ſet ouer the water into S.

Giles in the field: but theſe boyes with Argus and Linces eyes, ſet ſure watch vpon him and the one tooke a boate and followed him, and the other went backe to tell his maiſter.
               The boy that ſo followed him by water had no money to pay for his Boat hire, but laid his Penner and his ynkehorne to gage for a penny, and by that time the boy was ſet ouer, his Maiſter with all celeritie had taken a boate and followed him apace. Now had they a ſight ſtill of the Cranke, which croſſed ouer the fields towards Newingtō, and thither hee went, and by that time they came thither it was very darke: the Printer had there no acquaintance, neither any kinde of weapon about him, neither knew he how farre the Cranke would go, becauſe he then ſuſpected that they dogged him of purpoſe, he there ſtayed him, and called for the Conſtable, which came forth diligently to enquire what the matter was: this zealous printer charged this Officer with him as a malefactor and a diſſembling vagabonde, the Conſtable would haue laid him all night in the Cage that ſtoode in the ſtreete nay ſaith this pitiful printer, I pray you haue him into your houſe, for this is like to be a colde night, and he is naked, you keepe a vittelling houſe, let him bee wel cheriſhed this night for he is well able to pay for the ſame.

Thus he ſet him downe at the Chimnies end, and called for a pot of Beare and dranke of a quart at a draft, and called for another and ſo the thirde, that one had bin ſufficient for any reaſonable man, the Drinke was ſo ſtrong, that I my ſelfe ye next morning taſted thereof but let the reader uidge what & howe much he would haue drunke if he had binne out of feare. then when they had wrong water out of a flint, in ſpoyling him of his euill gotten goods, his paſſing pence and fleeting traſh. The Printer with this officer, were in gealy ielotie and deuiſed to ſearch a barne for ſome roges, and vpright men, a quarter of a mile from the houſe, that ſtoode alone in the fields, and went out about their buſines, leauing the Cranke alone with his wife and maydens, this craftie Cranke eſpying all gone, requeſted the good wife that he might goe on the backſyde to make water, and to exonerate his paunch, ſhe bad him drawe the latch of the dore and goe out, neither thinking or miſtruſting he would haue gone away naked, but to conclude when he was out, he caſt away the cloke, and as naked as euer he was borne he ran a way ouer the fields to his owne houſe, as he afterward ſaid. Now the next morning betimes I went vnto Newington to vnderſtād what was done becauſe I had word

But this leud loiterer could not lay his bones to labour, hauing once got the taſt of this lewd laſſe life for al this fair admonition, but deuiſed other ſubtil ſleights to maintaine his idle liuing and ſo craftily cloaſhed himſelfe in Marriners apparell, and aſſociated himſelfe with an other of his companions: they hauing both Marriners apparell▪ went abroad to aſke charitie of people, faining they had loſt their ſhip with all their goods by caſualtie on the Seas, wherewith they gained much. This craftie Cranke fearing to be mſſtruſted fell to another kind of begging as bad or worſe, and apparelled him ſelfe verie well with a faire blacke Freeze ceate, a newe paire of white hoſe, a fine felt hatte on his head, a ſhirt of Flaunders woorke, eſteemed to be woorth twentie ſixe ſhillings, and vpon New yeares day came againe into the white Friers to begge, the Printer hauing occaſion to goe that waies▪ not thinking of this Cranke, by chaunce mett with him who aſked his charitie for Gods ſake, the Printer vewing him well did miſſtruſt him, to bee the counterfet Cranke which deceaued him vpon Alhollon daye at night, demaunded of whence he was & what was his name, for ſ

And ſo he & the Cunſtable went to cary him to the Counter, as they were going vnder Ludgate this craftie Crank take his helees & ran downe the hill as faſt as he could dryue, the Cunſtable & ye Printer ran after him as faſt as they could, but ye Printer of ye twayne being lighter of foote, ouer tooke him at fleete brydge, and with ſtrong hand caried him to the Counter, and ſafely deliuered him.

The Printer being ſure thereof, repaired vnto the Counter, and rebuked him for his beaſtly behauiour, and tould him of his falſe fayning, and willed him to confeſſe it and aſke forgiuenes, he perceiued him to knowe his deepe diſſimulation, relented and confeſſed all his deceite, & ſo remayning in the Counter three dayes, was remoued to Bridewell, where he was ſtript ſtarke naked, and his vglye

attier put vpon him before the Maiſters therof, who wondred there at his diſſimulation greatly, for which offence he ſtood vpon the pillory in Cheapeſide both in his vgly and handſome attire: and after that went in the Mil while his vgly picture was a drawing, and then was whipped at a Cartes tayle through London, and his diſplayed banner carried before him vnto his owne boore: and ſo back to Bridewell againe, & there remained for a time, and at length was ſet at libertie on that condition he would proue an honeſt man, and labour truly to get his liuing. His picture remaineth in Bridewell for a monument.
            
            
               A Dommerar. Cap. 12.
               THeſe Dommerars are leud and moſt ſubtill people, the moſt part of theſe are Welch men, and will neuer ſpeake, vnleſſe they haue extreame puniſhment, but will gape, and with a maruellous force will hold downe their tongues doubled, groaning for your charitie, and holding vp their hands full piteouſly ſo that with their deep diſſimulation they get very much. Ther are of theſe many, and but one that I vnderſtand of hath loſt his tongue in deed. Hauing on a time occaſion to ride to Dartford to ſpeake with a Prieſt there, who maketh all kind of conſerues verie well, and vſeth ſtilling of waters. And repairing to his houſe I found a Dommerar at his doore, and the Prieſt himſelfe peruſing his licence, vnder the ſeales and hands of certaine worſhipful men, had thought the ſame to be good and effectuall. I taking the ſame writing, and reading it ouer, and noting the ſeales, found one of the ſeales like vnto a ſeale that I had about mee, which ſeale I bought beſides Charing croſſe, ſo that I was out of doubt it was none of the Gentlemens ſeales that had ſubſcribed. And hauing vnderſtanding before of their peeuiſh practiſes, made me to conceiue that all was forged and nought, I made the more haſt home for wel I wiſt that he muſt of force paſſe through the pariſh where I dwelt, for there was no other way for him. And comming homeward, I found them in the town according to my expectation, where they were ſtaied, for there was a Pallyard aſſociate with the Dommerar & partaker of his gaines, which Pallyard I ſaw not at Dartford. The ſtayers of them was a gentleman called Chayne, and a ſeruant of my Lord Keepers called Woſleſtow
                  ▪ which was the chiefe cauſer of the ſtaying of them, who being a ſurgeon, & cunning in his ſcience, had ſeene the like practiſes, and as hee ſaide, had cauſed one to ſpeake afore that was dombe. I chaunced to come at the beginning of the matter: Sir (q. this ſurgion) I am

bold here to vtter ſome part of my cunning, I truſt quoth hee, you ſhall ſee a miracle wrought anon: for I once made a dumbe man ſpeake. Quoth I, you are well mette, and ſomewhat you haue preuented me, for I had thought to haue done no leſſe before they had paſſed this towne: for I well knowe their wryting is fained, and they deepe diſſemblers. The Surgeon made him gape, and we could ſee but halfe a tongue. I required the Surgeon to put his finger in his mouth and to pull out his tongue, and ſo he did notwithſtanding he held ſtrongly a pretie while, at the length hee pluckt out the ſame, to the great admiration of the beholders: yet when we ſaw his tongue he would neither ſpeake, nor yet could heare. Quoth I to the Surgeon, knit two of his fingers together, and thruſt a ſticke betweene them, and rubbe the ſame vp and downe a little while, and for my life he ſpeaketh by and by. Sir quoth this Surgeon, I pray you let me practiſe another way, I was well contented to ſee the ſame. Hee had him into a houſe, and tyed a halter about the wreſts of his hands, and hoyſed him ouer a beame, and there did let him hang a good while: at the length with verie paine, he required for Gods ſake to lette him downe: ſo hee that was both deafe and dumbe, could in ſhort time both heare and ſpeake. Then I tooke the money I could finde in his purſe, and diſtributed the ſame to the poore people dwelling there, which was xv. pence halfepeny, being al that we could find. That done, and this merry miracle madly made, I ſent them with my ſeruaunt to the next Iuſticer, wher they preached on the pillory for want of a pulpit and were well whipped, and none did bewaile them.

For beſides money hee looketh for meate and drinke for dooing his dame pleaſure. For if ſhe haue three or foure holes in a panne, he will make as many more for ſpeedy gaine.

Thus with picking and ſtealing, mingled with a little woorke for a colour, they paſſe their time.

And for trueth there is none that goeth about the countrey of them, that can either write ſo good and faire a hand, or indite ſo learnedly as I haue ſeene and handled a number of them: but haue the ſame made in good townes, as what cannot be had for money (as the prouerbe ſaith) Omnia venalia Romae, and manie hath confeſſed the ſame to me. Now alſo there is a Patrico, and not a Patriarcha, which in their language is a Prieſt that ſhould make marriages till death depart, but they haue no ſuch I am well aſſured, for I put you out of doubt that not one amongſt a hundred of them are married, for they take lechery for no ſinne, but naturall fellowſhip and good liking loue, ſo that I will not blot my booke with theſe two that be not.

               THeſe Demanders for glimmar be for the moſt part women, for glymmar in their language is fier: theſe go with famed licences and counterfaited writings, hauing the hands and ſeales of ſuch Gentlemen as dwelleth neare to the place where they faine themſelues to haue beene burnt, and their gooddes conſumed with fire. They will moſt lamentably demaund your charitie, and will quickly ſhedde ſalte teares they bee ſo tender hearted. They will neuer begge in that Shire where their loſſes (as they ſay) was. Some of theſe go with ſtates at their backes, which is a ſheete to lye in a nights. The vpright men be verie familiar with theſe kinde of women, and one of them helpeth another.
               ¶A Demaunder for glymmar came vnto a good towne in Kent, to aſke the charitie of the people, hauing a fained licence about her▪ that declared her miſfortune by fire done in Somerſetſhire, walking with a Wallet on her ſhoulders, wherein ſhe put the deuotion of ſuch as had no money to giue her, that is to ſay Maite, wooll, bakon, bread and cheeſe▪ and alwayes as the ſame was full, ſo was it readie money to her when ſhe emptied the ſame, whereſoeuer ſhe trauelled. This harlot was (as they tearme it) ſnowt faire, and had an Upright man or two alwais attending on her watch (which is on her perſon) and yet ſo circumſpect that they would neuer be ſeene in her company in any good towne, except it were in ſmall villages where typlyng houſes were, either trauelling together by the high waies: but the truth is, by report ſhe would weekly be woorth ſix or ſeauen ſhillings, with her begging and bitcherie. This glymmering Mort repairing to an Inne in the ſaide towne, where dwelt a widow of fiftie winter old of good welth, but ſhe had an vnthriftie ſonne, whom ſhe vſed as a Chamberlaine to attend gueſtes when they repaired to her houſe. This amorous man beholding with ardent eyes this glymmering glauncer was preſently piteouſly pierced to the heart, and ſewdly longed to be clothed vnder her liuerey, and beſtowing a few fond words with her, vnderſtood ſtraight, that ſhe would bee eaſily perſwaded to liking lecherie, and as a man maſed, muſed how to attaine to his purpoſe, for hee had no money. Yet conſidering with h

                  mſelfe that wares would be welcome where money wanteth, he went with a wanton to his mothers chamber, and there ſeeking about for adde endes, at length found a litle whiſtle of ſiluer that his mother did vſe cuſtomably to weare on, and had forgot the ſame for haſte that morning, and offers the ſame cloſely to this mannerly Marian, that if ſhe would meete him on the backeſide of

the towne, and curteouſly kiſſe him without conſtraint, ſhe ſhuld be miſtreſſe thereof and it were much better, well ſaith ſhee you are a wanton, and beholding the whyſtell, was farther in loue there with, then rauiſht with his perſon, and agreed to meete him preſently and to accompliſhe his fonde fancy: to be ſhort & not tedious, a quarter of a mile from the towne he merrily took meaſure of her vnder a bawdy buſh (ſo ſhee gaue him that ſhee had not) and he receaued that he could not, and taking leaue of each other with a curteous kiſſe, ſhee pleaſantly paſſed forth on her iournay, and this vntoward lycorous Chamberlaine repayred homward. But ere theſe two Turtles tooke their leaue the good wife had miſſed her whiſtle, and ſent one of her maidens into her Chamber for the ſame and being long ſought for, none coulde bee found, her miſtres hearing that dilligent ſearch was made for the ſame, and that it was taken away, began to ſuſpect her vnbleſſed babe, and demaunded of her maidens whether none of them ſaw her ſon in her Chamber that morning, and one of them anſwered that ſhe ſaw him not there, but comming from thence: then had ſhee inough for well ſhee wiſt that he had the ſame, and ſent for him, but hee coulde not be found. Then ſhee cauſed her Hoſtier, in whom ſhee had better affiance for his truth, and yet not one amongſt twenty of them but haue well left their honeſty (as I heare a great ſort ſay) for to come vnto her, which attended to knowe her pleaſure, got ſeeke out ſaith ſhe my vntoward ſonne, and bid him come ſpeak with me: I ſaw him goe out ſaith hee halfe an houre ſithens on the backeſide, I had thought you had ſent him of your errand, I ſent him not quoth ſhee goe looke him out.
               ¶This hollow Hoſtler took his ſtaffe on his necke and trudged out apace that way hee ſawe him before goe, and had ſome vnderſtanding by one of the maidens that his miſtres had her whiſtle ſtolen, and ſhe ſuſpected her ſonne for it: he had not gone farre but he eſpied him comming homward alone, and meeting him demanded where he had beene. Where haue I beene quod he and began to ſmile, by the mas thou haſt beene at ſome baudy banquet, thou haſt euen told truth quoth this Chamberlain, ſurely quoth this hoſtler, thou hadſt the ſame woman that begged at our houſe to day with a lycence for the harmes ſhee had by fier, where is ſhee quoth he, ſhee is almoſt a mile by this time quod this Chamberlaine, where is my miſtres whiſtle quoth this Hoſtler, for I am well aſſured that thou hadſt it, and I feare me thou haſt giuen it to that harlot Why is it miſſed quod the Chamberlaine, yea quod the Hoſtler and ſhewed him all the whole circumſtance what was both ſaid and thought on him for

Well I wil tell thee quoth this chamberlaine, to be plaine with thee I had it in deede, and haue geuen the ſame to this woman, and I pray thee make the beſt of it, & helpe now to excuſe the matter, and yet ſurely and thou wouldeſt take ſo much paines for me as to ouertake hir for ſhee goeth but ſoftely and is not yet far of and take the ſame from hir, & I wilbe euer thy aſſured freend. Why then goe with me quoth this hoſteler, nay in faith quoth this chamberlin what is freer than gift, and I had prety paſtime for the ſame, hadſt thou ſo quoth this hoſtler now by the maſſe and I wil haue ſome to, or I will lie in ye duſt ere I come a gaine. Paſſing with haſt to ouertake this paramour within a mile from that place where he departed he ouertoke hir, hauing an vpright man in hir company a ſtrong & a ſturdy vagabond, ſome what amaſed was this hoſteler to ſe one familiarly in hir company, for he had wel hoped to haue had ſome delicate dalliance as his fellow had, but ſeeing the matter ſo fall out, and being of good corrage, & thinking to himſelfe that one true man, was better than two falſe knaues, and being on the high way, thought vpon helpe if neede had binne, by ſuch as had paſſed to and fro. Demaunded ferſely the whiſtle that ſhee had euen now of his fellowe, why huſband quoth ſhe, can you ſuffer this wretch to ſlaunder your wife, avaunt varlot quoth this vpright man and lets driue withal his force at the hoſtler, & after halfe a doſen blowes he ſtrikes his ſtaffe out of his hand, and as this hoſteler ſtept backe to haue taken vp his ſtaffe a gayne, this glymmering Morte flinges a great ſtone at him, & ſtrak him on the head, that downe he falles with the blood about his cares, and while he lay thus amaſed the vpright man ſnatches away his purſe, wherein he had money of his miſtreſſes, as well as of his owne, and there let him lie & went away with ſpeede, that they were neuer heard of more. When this drie beaten hoſteler was come to himſelfe, he faintly wandered home, and creepeth into his couche, and reſts his idel head, his miſtreſſe hard that he was come in, and laid him down on his bed▪ repaired ſtraight vnto him, & aſked him what he ayled, and what the cauſe was of his ſodaine lying on his bed, what is the cauſe quoth this hoſteler, your whiſtle your whiſtle, ſpeaking the ſame pyteouſlye thre or foure tymes, why foole quoth his miſtriſſe take no care for that, for I do not gretly way it, it was worth but three ſhillings foure pence, I wold it had bin burnt for foure yeares agon: I pray thee why quoth his myſtres, I thinke thou art mad, nay not yet quoth this hoſtler but I haue bin madly handled if you knew al, why what is the matter quoth his miſtreſſe? and was the more deſ

               The Baudy Baſket. cap. 17.
               THeſe Baudy baſkets be alſo women, that goe with baſkets and Capcaſes on there armes, wherein they haue Laces, pynnes, needles, white inkell, and round ſylke girdles of all colours. Theſe will buy conneyſkinns, & ſteale linnen clothes off hedges. And for theſe trifles they will procure of maiden ſeruants, when their miſtris or dame is out of the way, either ſome good peece of beefe, baken, or cheeſe, that ſhalbe worth xij. pence: for ij. pence of there toyes. And as they walke by ye way, they often gaine ſome money with their inſtrument, by ſuch as they ſodainely meet withall. The vpright men haue good acquaintance with theſe, & will helpe and relieue them when they want. Thus they trade there liues in lewd lothſome lechery. Amongſt them al is but one honeſt woman, & ſhe is of good yeares, hir name is Ione meſſinger, I haue had good proofe of hir, as I haue learned by the true reporte of diuers There came to my gate the laſt ſommer. 1566. a man much deformed and burnt in the face, blea

and be relieued and not to range about the Country, and ſeeing ſome cauſe of charitie, I cauſed him to haue meate and drinke, and when he had drunke I demaunded of him whether he was neuer ſpoyled of the vpright man or Rogue, yes that I haue quoth he and not this ſeauen yeares (for ſo long I haue gone abroad) I had not ſo much taken from me, nor ſo euil handled as I was within theſe foure daies, why how ſo quoth I? in good faith ſir quoth hee, I chaunced to meete with one of theſe baudy baſkets which had an vpright man in her company, and as I would haue paſſed quietly by her, man ſaith ſhee to her make, doe you not ſee this ilfauoured windſhaken knaue, yes quoth the vpright man, what ſay you to him, this knaue oweth mee two ſhillings for wares that he had of me halfe a yeare agoe, I thinke it well ſaith the vpright man, ſyrra ſaith hee, pay your debts: ſaith this poore man I owe her none, neither did I euer bargaine with her for any thing, and as I am well aduiſed, I neuer ſawe her before in all my life, mercy God quod ſhee, what a lying knaue is this, and if hee will not pay you huſband beat him ſurely, and the vpright man gaue mee three or foure blowes on my backe and ſhoulders, and hee would haue beaten me worſe had I not giuen him all the mony in my purſe which was iuſt fourteene pence: why ſaith the baudy baſket haſt thou no more? then thou oweſt me ten pence ſtill, and bee well aſſured I will be paid the next time I meete with thee. And ſo they let me paſſe by them: I pray God ſaue and bleſſe me and all other in my caſe from ſuch wicked perſons: why whither went they then quoth I? into Eaſt-Kent, for I met with them on this ſide of Rocheſter: I haue diuers times beene attempted but I neuer loſt much before this vnhappy time. Well quod I thanke God for all, and repaire home into thy natiue Country.
            
            
               A Autem Mort.
               THeſe Autem Morts be married women, for Autem in their Language is a Church, ſo ſhee is a wife married at the Church, and they bee as chaſte as a Cowe which goeth to Bull euery moone, with what Bull ſhe careth not. Theſe walke moſt times from their huſbands company a month or more together, beeing aſſociate with another as honeſt as her ſelfe. Theſe will pilfer clothes off hedges, ſome of them goe with children of ten or twelue yeares old, and if time and place ſerue for their purpoſe, they will ſende them into ſome houſe at the window to ſteale and rob, which they call in their language, Milling of the ken, and will go with wallets on ther ſhoulders and ſlates at their backes, there is one of theſe Autem Mortes

ſhee is now a widow of fifty yeares old, her name is Alice Milſon, ſhee goeth about with a couple of great boyes, the youngeſt of them is about twenty yeares of age, and theſe two lie with her euery night and ſhee lyeth in the mids, ſhee ſaith that they be her children, but beetleheaded be the babes borne of ſuch an abhominable belly.
            
            
               A walking Mort. cap. 19.
               THeſe walking Morts be not married theſe for their vnhappy yeares doth goe as an Autem Mort, and will ſay their huſbands died either at Newhauen, Ireland, or in ſome ſeruice of the Prince. Theſe make laces vpon ſtaues and purſes that they carry in their hands, & white vallance for beds. Many of theſe hath had and haue children: when theſe get ought, either with begging bychery or bribery, as money or apparrell, they are quickly ſhaken out of all by the vpright men. Wherfore this pollicie they vſe, they leaue their money with ſome truſty friend or other being houſholders either man or wife, ſometime in one ſhire, and then in another as they trauell: this haue I I knowne that 4. s. or 5. s. yea, 10. s. left in a place, and the ſame will they come for againe within one quarter of a yeare, or ſomtime not in halfe a yeare, yet it is to litle purpoſe, for if they buy them any garments either linnen or woollen they are taken from them and worſe giuen them, or elſe none at all.
               ¶The laſt Sommer An. 1565. being in familliar talke with a walking Mort, that came to my gate, I learned by her what I could for my purpoſe, and then I rebuked her for her lewd life and beaſtly behauiour, declaring to her what puniſhment was prepared for her in the world to come. God helpe me quod ſhee how ſhould I liue, none will take me into ſeruice, but I labour in harueſt time honeſtly. I thinke but a while with honeſty quod I.

And becauſe there was no conuenient place nere hand, I required him that I might go waſh my ſelf & make me ſome what cleanly, and I would come to his houſe and lodge al night in his barne, whither he

So I went away from him & glad was I, & why ſo quoth I? becauſe quoth ſhe his wife my good dame is my very frende, & I am much be holding to hir. And ſhe had done me ſo much good ere this, that I was loth to harme hir any way, why ſo quoth I? what and it had bin any other man & not your good dames huſband.

Then he called to his wife for his ſupper ſitting downe very pleaſant, nothing vnderſtanding of the banquet that was prepared for him after ſupper, and according to the prouerbe (that ſweete meate will haue ſowre ſawce) thus when he was well refreſhed, and his ſpirits reuiued, hee entered into familiar talke with his wife of many matters howe well hee had ſpent that day to their great profits, ſaying ſome of his cattell were like to be drowned in the ditches, driuing other of his neighbors cattell out that were in his paſtures, and mending his fences that were broken downe. Thus profitably he had conſumed the day, nothing talking of his helping the walking Mort out of the mire, neither of his requeſt nor yet of her promiſe. Thus feeding her with friendly fantaſies conſumed two houres and more. Then fayning how he would ſee in what caſe his horſes were in and how they wer dreſſed, repaired couertly into the barne, where as his friendly foes lurked priuily, vnleſſe it were this mannerly Mort, that comly couched on a bottle of ſtraw. What are you come q. ſhe? by the maſſe I would not for a hundred pound that my dame or anie of your houſe knew you were here. No I warrant thee ſaith this good man they be all ſafe inough at their work, and I will bee at mine anon He lay dovvne by her, and ſtraight vvould haue had to doe vvith her, nay fie ſaith ſhee this order is vnſeemely, if you lie vvith me you ſhall ſurely vntruſſe you, and put dovvne your hoſen for that vvay is moſt eaſieſt and beſt, ſaieſt thou ſo quoth he, novv by my troth agreed, And vvhen he had vntruſſed himſelfe he began to aſſalt the vnſatiable fort: vvhy quoth ſhee that vvas vvithout ſhame, ſauing for her promiſe, are you not aſhamed: neuer a vvhit ſaith he, lye dovvne quickly. Novv lye for ſhame fie, ſaith ſhe aloud, vvhich vvas the vvatchvvord: vvherat theſe fiue furious ſturdy muffled goſſips flinges out, taking ſure hold of him, plucking his hoſen dovvn lovver, & binding thē about his feet, then binding his hands, & knitting a handkercher

about his eyes that he ſhould not ſee, they laid him on vntil they were windles: be good ſaith this Mort vnto my maiſter for the paſſion of God, and laid on as faſt as the reſt, and ſtill ceaſed not to beat him till the bloud burſt plentifully out in moſt places, then they let him lie ſtill bound, with this exhortation, that hee ſhould from that time foorth know his owne Wife from other mens, and that this puniſhment was but a fle

Thus leauing him blowing and foming for paine and melancholy that he could not be reuenged of them, they vaniſhed away and had this Mort with them, ſafely conuaying her out of the towne. Soone after commeth into the barne one of the good mans boyes to fet ſome hay for his horſe, who finding his maiſter faſt bound and greeuouſly beaten with rods, was ſodainly abaſhed, and would haue run out to call for helpe, but his maiſter bid him vnbind him, and make no words thereof, for I will be reuenged well inough, yet after better aduiſe hee thought it meeter to let the ſame paſſe, than (as the prouerbe is) to awake a ſleeping dogge. And by my troth (quoth this walking Morte) I come now from that place, and was neuer there ſince this part was plaid, which is ſomewhat more than a yeare: and I heare a very good report of him now, that hee loueth his Wyfe well, and liueth honeſtly: now tell me was not this a good acte. It was pretely handled quoth I, is this all? yea quoth ſhe, here is the end.

I chanced not long ſince familiarly to commune with a Doxe that came to my gate, and ſurely a pleaſant harlot, and not ſo pleaſant as witty, and not ſo witty as void of all grace and goodnes▪ I founde by her talke that ſhe had paſſed her time lewdly eighteene yeres in walking

about. I thought this a neceſſary inſtrument to attaine ſome knowledge by, and before I would grope her mind, I made her both to eate and drinke well: that done, I promiſed her ſome money if ſhe would open and diſcouer to me ſuch queſtions as I would aſke of her, & neuer to bewray her, nor diſcloſe her name. And you ſhould ſaith ſhe▪ I were vndone: feare not that quoth I, but I pray thee ſay nothing but truth. I will not q. I: Then firſt tell me quoth I, how many vpright men and Roges doeſt thou know, or haſt thou knowne and beene conuerſant with, & what their names be: ſhe pauſed a while, and demanded of him why he did aſke. For nothing els ſaid I, but to know them whē they come to my gate. Now by my troth quoth ſhe then are you neuer the neare, for all my acquaintance for the moſt part are dead. Dead quoth I, how dyed they, for want of cheriſhing, or of painfull diſeaſes? Then ſhe ſighed and ſaid they were hanged. What all quoth I, and ſo many walke abroad as daily I ſee? By my troth ſaid ſhe, I know not paſt ſix or ſeuen by their names and named them to me. When were they hanged quoth I? Some ſeuen yeares ago, ſome three yeares, and ſome within this fortnight, and declared wher they were executed, which I knew well to be true by the report of others. Why q. I, did not this fearefull ſight much greeue thee for thy time long and euill ſpent. I was ſorry quoth ſhe, for ſome of them were louing men: for I lacked not when they had it, and they wanted not when I had it, and diuers of them I neuer did forſake till the gallowes parted vs. O mercifull God quoth I, and beganne to bleſſe mee. Why do you ſo quoth ſhe? alas you know that euerie one muſt haue a liuing. Other matters I talkt of, but this now may ſuffiſe to ſhew the Reader as it were in a glaſſe the bolde beaſtly life of theſe Doxes. For ſuch as haue gone any time abroad, will neuer forſake their trade to die therfore, I haue had good proofe thereof. There is one a notorious harlot of this affinitie, called Beſſe Bottomley, ſhe hath but one hand, and ſhee hath murthered two children at the leaſt.
            
            
               A Dell. Cap. 21.
               
                  A Dell is a yong wench able for generation, and not yet broken by the vpright man. Theſe go abroad yoong, eyther by the death of their parents, and no body to looke vnto them, or els by ſome ſharpe miſtreſſe that they ſerue, doe runne out of ſeruice, or els ſhe is naturally borne one, and then ſhe is a wild Dell: theſe are broken very yoong, when they haue beene layen withall by the vpright men, then they be Doxes and no Dels. Theſe wilde Dels beeing traded vp with their monſtrous mothers, muſt of neceſſitie be as euill or worſe than their parents,

for neither wee gather grapes from greene bryars, neither figs from thiſtles: but ſuch buds, ſuch bloſſoms▪ ſuch euil ſeed ſown, well worſe beeing growne.
            
            
               A Kinching Morte. Cap. 22.
               
                  A Kinching Mort is a little Girle, the Morts their mothers carry them at their backes in their ſlates, which is theyr ſheetes, and brings them vp ſauagely till they growe to be ripe, and ſoone ripe, ſoone rotten.
            
            
               A Kinching Co. Cap. 23.
               
                  A Kinching Co is a yong boy, traded vp to ſuch peeuiſh purpoſes as you haue heard of other yoong ympes before, that growing to yeares, are better to hang than to draw forth.
            
            
               Thei. vſage in the night. Cap. 24.
               NOw I thinke it not vnneceſſary to make the Reader vnderſtand, how and in what manner they lodge a nights in barns and backhouſes, and of their vſage there, for aſmuch as I haue acquainted them with their orders and practiſes in the day time: The arch and chiefe walkers that hath walked a long time, whoſe experience is great, becauſe of their continuall practiſe, I meane all Morts and Doxes, for their handſomnes and diligence for making of their couches. The men neuer troble themſelues with that thing, but takes the ſame to be the dutie of the wife. And ſhee ſhuffels vp a quantitie of ſtraw or hay into ſome pretie corner of the barne, where ſhe may conueniently lye, and well ſhaketh the ſame, making the head ſomwhat hie, and driues the ſame vpon the ſides till it be like a bed, then ſhee layeth her wallet or ſome other little packe of rags or ſcrip vnder head in the ſtraw, to beare vp the ſame, and layeth her pettycote or cloke vpon and ouer the ſtraw, ſo made like a bed, and that ſerueth for the blanket

                   then ſhe layeth her ſ

                  ate, which is her ſheet vpon that, if ſhe haue no ſheet (as few of them go with out) then ſhe ſpreadeth ſome large clou
                     •
                  s or rags ouer the ſame, and maketh her ready, and layeth her drowſily downe. Manie will pull off their ſmocks, and lay the ſame vpon them in ſteade of their vpper ſheet, and all her other pelt and traſh vppon her alſo, but many lie in their ſmocks: and if the reſt of her clothes in cold weather be not ſufficient to keepe her warme, then ſhe taketh ſtraw or hay to performe the matter. The other ſorte that haue no ſlates, but tumble downe, and couch a hogſhead in their clothes, theſe bee ſtill lowſie and ſhall neuer bee without ver

                   vnleſſe they put off their clothes, and lye as is aboueſaide.

If the vpright man come in where they lye, he hath his choiſe, and creepeth in cloſe by his Doxe, the Roge hath his leauings. If the Morts or Doxes lie or be lodged in ſome farmers barn, and the doore be either locked or made faſt to them, then wil not the vpright man preſſe to come in vnleſſe it bee in barnes & out houſes ſtanding alone, or ſome diſtance from houſes, which bee commonly knowne to them. As S. Quintens, three Cranes in the Vintrey, S. Tybbes, and Knapſbury, Theſe foure be within one myle compaſſe neare vnto London. Then haue you foure more in Middleſex: Draw the pudding out of the fire, in Harrow on the hill pariſh, the Croſſe

                  es in Cranford pariſh, S. Iulians in Chiſtleworth pariſh, the houſe of pittie in North hall pariſh. Theſe are the chiefe houſes neare about London, where commonly they reſort vnto for lodging, and may repaire thither freely at all times. Sometime ſhall come in ſome Roge, ſome picking knaue, a nimble Prigge, hee walketh in ſoftly on nights when they be at reſt and plucketh of as many garments as be ought worth, that he may come by, and may eaſily carrie, and runneth away therewith, and maketh porte ſale at ſome conuenient place of theirs▪ that ſome be ſoon readie in the morning for want of their Caſters and Togemans: where in ſtead of bleſſing, is curſing: in place of praying, peſtilent prating, with odious othes and terrible threatnings. The vpright men haue giuen all theſe nicke names to the places aboueſaid. Yet haue we two notable places in Kent, not farre from London: the one is betweene Detford and Rothered, called the Kinges Barne, ſtanding alone, that they haunt commonly: the other is Ketbroke, ſtanding by Black heath halfe a mile from any houſe. There will they boldly draw the latch of the doore, and goe in when his family be at ſupper, and ſit downe without leaue, and eate and drinke with them, and eyther lie in the hall by the fire all night, or in the Barne, if there bee no roome in the houſe for them. If the doore be eyther bolted or lockt, and be not opened vnto them when they will, they will breake the ſame open to his further coſt. And in this barne ſometime do lie forty vpright men with their Doxes together at one time. And this muſt the poore Farmar ſuffer, or els they threaten to burne him, and all that he hath.
