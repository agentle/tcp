               LONDON, Printed by William Iaggard for Nicholas Bourne, and are to be ſold at his ſhop at the South entry of the Royal Exchange. 1615.
         
      
      
         
            
            
            Britaines Buſſe.
            
               DIuers Treatiſes haue bene publiſhed heere in England, ſome long ſince, ſome very lately, all of them inviting to the building and employing of Engliſh Fiſhing ſhippes, ſuch as our neighbour Hollanders call Buſſes, Principally to fiſh for Herrings, with which kinde of Fiſh (Almighty GOD of his rich bounty, bleſſed be his name therefore) hath abundantly ſtored his Maieſties Streames, on the coaſts of England, Scotland, and Ireland, aboue all the knowne parts of the world.
            Foure Bookes I haue ſeene of this Subiect.
            One called the Brittiſh Monarchy, written An. Dom. 1576. which is nere 40 yeares paſt.
            The ſecond intituled Hitchcocks New-yeares gift, printed about 30 yeares ſince.
            The third, named Englands way to win wealth, and to encreaſe Ships and Marriners, publiſhed within theſe 2. yeares, whoſe Author▪ (I haue heard) was trained vppe from his youth: and very expert both in Nauigation and Fiſhing.
            The fourth ſtyled the Trades Increaſe, now newly come abroad.
            
               
In all which foure Bookes, but eſpecially in the two laſt, the Neceſſity, Faculty, Profit, and Vſe of that Fiſhing trade is proponed and handled.
            After I had read three of the former Bookes, and before the fourth and laſt came to light, I was much affected with the buſineſſe. And the more I conſider it, the more is my affection confirmed and encreaſed. And out of vehement deſire to ſee this worke, which I conceiue to tend ſo much to Gods glory: To the honour of our noble King: To the generall ſtrength, ſafety, and commodity of all his Maieſties large Kingdomes and Dominions: And to the priuate and peculiar benefite and aduancement of euery priuate Vndertaker therein. I ſay out of vehement deſire to ſee this worke in hand, & the proſperity thereof, I enquired as often (as conueniently I could) what Buſſes or Fiſhing Ships were in building on our Coaſts, or were bought or vſed by any Engliſh.
            At length I was informed (and that very truely) that one Roger Godsdue Eſquire, of Bucknam Ferry in Norfolke, had begun to apply himſelfe to this worthy work, and had on the Stockes at Yarmoth fiue Buſſes; whereof I vnderſtand one is ſince that time launched, and that the other foure are in good forwardneſſe. But when vpon enquiry after the Gentleman, I heard him to be a man of ſuch vndoubted honeſty and integrity, beſides his other vertues and worth, Methought I did ſee God beginning this good buſineſſe in a good hand.
            Soone after I heard that another worthy gentleman, namely Sir William Haruie Knight had on the Stockes at Lyme-houſe in the yard of M. Steuens, Shipwright, another very faire large Buſſe neere as big as any Flemiſh Buſſe: which Buſſe I did after ſee my ſelfe when ſhe was

in launching; and ſhe is now in the Thames before Radcliffe.
            
            But beſide theſe two Gentlemen, I haue not yet heard of any Engliſh that haue yet applyed themſelues that way.
            Now becauſe after many conſiderations of that matter, I perceiued that none of the foure Treatiſes before mentioned, had ſet downe in very plaine particulars the exact charge of Building, Manning, Victualling, and furniſhing of ſuch a Buſſe; and of the gaine or profite, which by Gods bleſſing in probability may redounde yearely to the particular Owner and Aduenturer of ſuch a Shippe.
            And conceiuing Hope that the publication of ſuch particulars, might be ſome furtherance of the Action.
            I reſolued to beſtow my beſt labours to get ſuch Particulars; and to that end I trauailed and conferred with ſuch both Ship-wrights, Marriners, Fiſhermen, Netmakers, and others, as I thought to bee able to informe me in the Premiſſes, that ſo I alſo might bring Straw or Morter to that noble Building. Or that I might picke or teaze Occam, or do ſomwhat, that am not able to do much.
            And for that vpon conference with ſome experienced in this Herring Fiſhing, I am informed that a Buſſe of thirty fiue Laſt, that is, of ſeauenty Tunne, is of a very good and meete ſize or ſcantling, wherewith in a foure months fiſhing yearely to make the gaine or profite by Herring onely; Heereafter in particular ſet downe, beſides her imployment yearely alſo Cod-fiſhing, &c.
            
               
               I haue therefore here imparted ſuch Inſtructions as I could attaine vnto.
               1. FIrſt, of the preciſe dimentions or proportions of ſuch a Buſſe of 35 Laſt. That is of 70 Tun.
               2. Secondly, the vttermoſt Charges of ſuch a Buſſe, and the particular of all her Maſtes, Yardes, Sailes, Flagges, Pullies, Shiuers, Tackling, Cables and Anchors, together alſo with her cock-boat and oares.
               3. Thirdly, the particulars of her Carpenters ſtore, and of her Stewards ſtore, and of her weapons, and the charge of them all.
               4. Fourthly, the particulars of her Herring Nets, and of the VVarropes and other Ropes, Cords and lines, Corke, Pynbols or Buyes belonging to thoſe Nets, with the particular charges of them all.
               5. Fiftly, the particular Tooles and Implements vſed in dreſſing and packing of the ſaide Herrings, and their particular prizes.
               6. Sixtly, the charge of one hundred Laſt of Herring Caskes or Barrels, and of Salt needefull for the packing of C. Laſt of Herrings.
               7. Seuenthly, the particular charge of foure months victuals for 16 perſons to ſerue in the ſaide Buſſe: and the particular charge of Phyſicke and Chirurgerie helpes for thoſe xvi. perſons.
               8. Eightly, the particular vtmoſt wages of the ſaide xvi. perſons for the ſaide foure months.
               9. Laſtly, the gaine or profit (by Gods bleſsing) hoped for, by ſuch a foure months Herring-fiſhing.
               
                  
Afterwards is alſo ſet downe the yearely Charges of repayring the ſaide Buſſe: and of her apparrell and Furniture. And alſo of the ſaid Nets, &c.
               Together with the reſt of the ſecond yeares Charge and Gaine.
               
               By which ſecond yeares Charge and Gaine, you ſhall ſee the charge and gaine of euery year following ſo long as the Buſſe laſteth: which (by Gods bleſsing and good vſage) may well be twenty yeares at leaſt.
               HE that will giue a probable eſtimate of any Charge, muſt tye himſelfe to ſome particular proportions, which hee muſt admit as the very iuſt allowances.
               But I would haue none to imagine that I intend theſe particulars to be ſuch as may not be varied.
               If any be ſo vaine to make ſcornfull conſtructions, I holdſuch fellowes not worth the thinking on.

                        IT appeares before in particulars, That a New Buſſe with her Nets and other appurtenances, together with all the firſt yeares Charge of Salt, Caske, Victuals, Wages, &c. wil come to—934-5-8
                         
                         
                         
                     
                     
                        But it is to be obſerued, that the owner & Aduenturer of ſuch a Buſſe, ſhall not be out of purſe, nor Aduenture ſo much money the ſaid firſt yeare, by—171—10—0
                         
                         
                         
                     
                     
                        For the Wages aforeſaide is neuer paide till the returne of the Ship or buſſe; which if it ſhould neuer return (as God forbid) then is no wages paid. So wages is parte of the Charge, but no part of the Aduenture. And ſo the wages is ſpared from Aduenture, which comes to as before in particulars

               Towards which aduenture and Charge, there is before accompted to be gotten in money by the firſt yeares Herring fiſhing as before appeares—65—14—4.
               So then the ſecond yeares Charge, beſides the ſayde 65—14—4. before gained, will be but 334—5—8.
               But the ſaid ſecond yeares Aduenture, beſides the ſayde gaine, will be but 162—15—8.
               So it appeares, That if the buſſe be onely imployed in fiſhing the Herring, and in that but onely one foure monthes in euery yeare: and that the Buſſe lye ſtill in her owne port all the reſt of the yeare: that is nine moneths in euerie yeare idle, yet ſhe gaines clearly euery yeare in that foure monthes (onely) the ſum of 600. li—o s—o d. If God giue her in that time, but the ſaid C. Laſt of Herrings, which being ſolde but at ten pound a Laſt, yeeld 1000. li.—o s—o d. Out of which deducting the ſaide ſecond yeares Charge of 400. li. aforeſaid, there reſteth as gained cleerely—600 li.—o—o yearly by the ſaide Buſſe.

               And that the ſame 762—15—8. is clearly inned againe, together with all other charges, and 65—14—4. ouer and aboue within leſſe then a yeare, & ſo the Buſſe with her Nets and furniture, and the ſaide 65—14—4. in money is gayned clearly the firſt voyage.
               And that if the Buſſe do alſo that yeare make a Cod-fiſhing voyage as aforeſaide, then I ſay, within the ſpace of the ſaid firſt yeare, the Aduenturer or the ſaid Partners ſhal haue all their ſtocks into their purſe againe as aforeſaide, and ſhall alſo haue in purſe gained cleerly the ſaid firſt year 362-17-8 which gaine is more then is to be disburſed the ſecond yeare in repayring the ſaid Buſſe, with her appurtenances, &c. And alſo in furniſhing her with new Herring Cask, Salt, Victual, &c. for the ſecond yeares Herring fiſhing.
               And that the ſaid Aduenturer or Partners, after the ſaide firſt yeare, ſhall neuer be out of purſe any money at all.
               But that the firſt yeares cleare gaine will ſtocke him or them ſo ſufficiently for the vſe of this Buſſe, as by the ſame they may get cleerely after the ſaide firſt yeare, by two ſuch voyages in that buſſe, yearly ouer and aboue all charges.

I Confeſſe the priuate gaine to euery Vndertaker before propounded, may ſeeme too great to be hoped for: but before any conclude ſo, let them read the Proclamation concerning this buſineſſe, made by thoſe thriuing-States of the vnited prouinces of the Low Countries, and let them conſider what ſhould mooue thoſe States in that publique proclamation, to call this Herring fiſhing, the Chiefeſt-Trade, and Principall Gold-Mine of thoſe vnited prouinces, and to ſhew ſuch Iealouſie, and prouide ſo very carefully for the preſeruation thereof, If the gaine thereby were not exceeding great and extraordinary.
               
               That Proclamation tranſlated out of Dutch into Engliſh, is affixed to the end of the Booke before mentioned, called Englands way to win wealth: and is here alſo againe annexed to theſe preſents, as a thing to be often ſeene and conſidered of vs.
               And for my ſelfe, I ſay that I know, that No man may doe euill, that good may come of it: Therefore I would not deuiſe a lye to perſwade any to a worke how good ſoeuer; nor commend that to others, which my owne heart were not firſt ſtrongly perſwaded to be commendable: yet as I denye not but that I may erre in ſome of ſo many particulars: ſo I diſdaine not, but rather deſire to ſee ſuch errors, honeſtly and fairely corrected by any that out of more skill, and deſire of perfecting and furthering this good worke, ſhall finde out any ſuch errors.
               And whether this Fiſhery be Neceſſary for this Commonwealth or no, let the preſent condition and eſtate of our ſhipping and Mariners, and Sea Townes, and Coaſtes, which (as the meanes) ſhould be the wals and ſtrength of this Ilandiſh Monarchy; I ſay let them ſpeake. I will ſay no more to this poynt, as well for other reaſons, as alſo becauſe this matter is but for a fewe alas: namely for thoſe onely that preferre the Common wealth to their owne priuate: and they are wiſe, and a word is enough to ſuch.
               If any be ſo weake to thinke this Mechanicall Fiſher-Trade not feaſible by the Engliſh people: to them I may ſay with Salomon Goe to the Piſmire looke vpon the Dutch thou ſluggard, learne of them, they do it daily in the ſight of all men at our owne doores, vpon our owne coaſtes. But ſome will needs feare a Lion in euerie way, becauſe they will imploy their Tallents no way, but lie vnprofitable at home alwaies.
            
            
               
               The difficulties that Vnwillingnes hath obiected, Conſiſts in want of Men, of Nets, of Caske, of Timber, and Plank, of Vtterance or Sale, and of the feare of Pyrats, of euerie of which a word or two.
               THE 16. Men and boyes before admitted to ſerue in the ſaide Buſſe, may bee theſe: (viz.) A Mayſter, a Mate, foure ordinary Sailors, and foure Fiſher-men, there is ten, and then ſix Land-men and boyes to bee trained vp by the former Ten men in the Art of Sayling, and Craft of Fiſhery.
               
               By which meanes euery Buſſe ſhall be a Seminary of Saylors and Fiſhers alſo, for ſo ſhall euery buſſe breede and make ſixe new Marriners: and ſo euery 100. buſſes breede 600. new marriners to ſerue in ſuch other buſſes as ſhall be after builded, which is alſo no ſmall addition to the ſtrength of this ſtate.
               
                  Marriners. Now if there were 100. buſſes preſently to bee builded, I would make no doubt (as hard as the world goes) but before they could be fitted for the Sea, there may be gathered vp about the Coaſt-Townes of his maieſties Dominions at leaſt an C. able Maiſters to take Charge of them. And another C. of Marriners to goe with them as their Mates: and foure C. Saylors to ſerue vnder the ſaide C. Maiſters, that is in all but 600. Marriners and Saylors. For I finde in the 35. page of Englands way to win wealth (the Author whereof was a Yarmouth man) that the laſt winter but one, There were in that one Towne of Yarmouth 300. idle men that could get nothing to do, liuing poore for lacke of employment, vvho most gladly vvould haue gone to Sea in Pinkes, if there had beene any for them to goe in. I haue reported his owne words.
               
                  
                  Fiſhermen. And for the foure hundred Fiſhermen to ſerue in the C. Buſſes, they would ſoone be furniſhed out of thoſe poore Fiſhers in Small boates, as Traules, Cobbles, &c. which fiſh all about the Coaſtes, which poore men by thoſe ſmall veſſels can hardly get their bread, and therefore would holde it great preferment to bee called into ſuch Buſſes where they may haue meat, drinke, and wages as before is liberally propounded for ſuch. Beſides, which if neede be there are too too many of thoſe pernitious Trinker-men, who with Trinker-boates deſtroye the Riuer of Thames, by killing the Fry and ſmall Fiſh there, euen all that comes to Net, before it bee eyther meate or Marketable. Which Trinkermen (if they will not offer themſelues) may by order and authoriry of our State be compelled to giue ouer that Euil, and to follow this good Trade.
               
                  Landme for a Seminary. But for the ſaide 6. C. Land-men to ſerue in theſe C Buſſes we neede not ſtudy where to finde them; if ſuch ſhoulde not ſeeke for ſeruice in theſe Buſſes, the verie ſtreets of London and the Subburbs will ſoone ſhew & afford them, if it were ſo many thouſand I thinke. Idle Vagrants ſo extreamely ſwarme there as all knowe. So much for men.
               
                  Nets. Nettes will be the hardeſt matter to prouide at the firſt; yet I vnderſtand that the before named Knight, Sir William Haruey, had in few weekes or moneths prouided all his Nets for his great Buſſe. And my ſelfe was offered Nettes for halfe a dozen Buſſes, if I would haue had them the laſt Sommer: and if there were now 100. Buſſes in building, I am informed of one that will vndertake to furniſh them all with Nets. And after theſe Buſſes ſhall once be ſeene, many for their owne gaine will prouide for Hemp, twine, & all neceſſaries to the making of

Nets enough. And doubtles Scotland and Ireland will preſently afford good helpe in this behalfe.
               
                  Caske. Caske will be plentifully ſerued by Scotland and Ireland, though we ſhould make none of Engliſh Timber.
               
                  Timber & Plank. And for all the great and pittifull waſte of our Engliſh VVoods, yet will England afford Timber & Plank enough for many Buſſes: but (to ſpare England a while) Ireland will yeeld vs Buſſes enough beſides many other good Shippes, if need be; and Scotland will help vs with Maſts, but if we would ſpare ſo neare home, we may help our ſelues out of Virginia and Sommer-Iſlands. I wis the Dutch who haue no Materials in any Dominions of their owne, haue made harder and deerer ſhifts for their multitudes of Ships of all ſorts: If they had ſhifted off the building of Ships, becauſe they had no Timber or other ſhipping ſtuffe of their owne in their owne Lands, what a poore, naked, ſeruile people, had that free people beene ere this day?
               Touching Vtterance and Sale of Herrings when we Vtterāce or Sale.ſhall haue them: I am informed that there is yearely vttered and ſpent in his Maieſties owne Dominions, at leaſt ten thouſand Laſt of Herrings, which being ſerued by our ſelues, will keep in the Land aboundance of Treſure, which the Dutch yearely carry out for the Herrings which they catch on our own coaſts, and ſell to vs. Now, if ſuch a Buſſe as aforeſaide get yearely C. Laſt of Herrings, as aforeſaid: then an hundred Buſſes taking yearely C. Laſt a peece, doe take in all ten thouſand Laſt of Herrings. So then his Maieſties owne Dominions wil vtter all the Herrings which C. Buſſes ſhal take in a year. And then if wee ſhall haue 500. Buſſes more, I am perſwaded we may in France, and in Danske, & in other forraigne parts, haue as good and ready ſale for them, as the

Dutch haue for theirs; for I heare that the Dutch could yearely vtter double ſo many as they doe ſell if they had them. But if that ſhould not bee ſo, ſurely it were too great pouerty for Engliſh mindes (like Horſes that know not their owne ſtrength) to feare to ſet foote by the Dutch, or by any other people vnder Heauen, or to feare to ſpeede woorſe in any Market or place then they: and yet not be driuen to beat down the Markets neither, except the Dutch ſhould prooue more froward and food then I can yet miſtruſt: but if they ſhould, I will not bee perſwaded to thinke, but that the worſer part would fall out to their ſhare at laſt.
               If there will bee imployment but for 1000. Buſſes, me thinke they ſhould thanke vs, (as for many other benefits, ſo for this,) that wee will bee contented that they ſhare with vs, by vſing onely 500. Buſſes, & to fiſh frendly in conſort, as it were with other 500. Buſſes of ours. But if they ſhould alleadge, that they now hauing a thouſand, ſhall haue (in that caſe) imployment for the other 500: why then perhappes wee may in friendly manner cope with them, and buy of them the other 500. of the ſaid Buſſes.
               I thanke God I neither hate nor enuy the Dutch; nay (for good and due reſpects) I preferre them to all other forraigne Nations in my loue; and they acknowledging vs as they ought, wee ſhall I hope doe them no wrong, and they muſt doe vs right.
               I haue herein bin longer then I meant, onely becauſe there came euen now to my minde ſome reports that I haue heard, (but doe not beleeue) of very foule and inſolent dealing of their Buſſe-men with our poore weake Fiſher-men vppon our Coaſtes. But if it were true, as I doubt it at leaſt; yet I would not hate nor ſpeak euill of

a whole State for the ſawcie preſumptions of a particular man, or of a few men, and thoſe perhappes prouoked thereto, by our owne Double-Beere of England.
               
                  Pirats & Enemies. It is too true that all ſeas are too full of Pirats, and that amongſt them (which wee haue great cauſe to lament) our Engliſh abound, who are too ready to iuſtifie their lewd errors with the want of imployment. It is true alſo, that men are not to get their liuing by ſinful▪ violent, and vnlawfull courſes; yet I would they were ſtript of that colour and pretence, (which a good fleete of Buſſes would doe:) Beſide, ſuch a fleet of Buſſes will (by Gods grace be ſoone able to maintaine about them a guard of ſtrong warlike ſhips wel appointed to defend them. And in time of neede alſo to ſerue his Maieſty, and offend his enemies: and ſuch a guard will be very requiſite, althogh God hath ſo laid and placed the Herrings, as our Buſſes ſhall ſeldome need to lie or to labour out of the ſight of our owne ſhores. So much of the facility.
               Laſtly, touching the vſe of this famous Fiſher-trade, I will onely commend vnto your conſiderations, that which is written thereof in all the foure Bookes before mentioned: namely, in the Brittiſh Monarchy, and Hitchcocks New-yeares-guift, and in Englands way to win wealth &c. and in the Trades increaſe. The Dutch haue thereby as by their onely or chiefe meanes curbed and bearded their aduerſaries; what then may wee doe by it, if God pleaſe, we I ſay to whome he hath vouchſafed multitudes of other helpes (which Dutch▪land hath not) to ſecond this; this trade ſets awarke all their idle, it keeps their gold & ſiluer in their dominions and multiplies it.
               And I ſee not why the ſame trade ſhould not bee of the ſame vſe to vs.
               
                  
1. NOw Aboord our Buſſes again, which once wel eſtabliſhed and followed, will in ſhort time I hope by Gods bleſſing ſet many Ploughmen heere on worke, to ſowe Hemp & Flax, both in England, Scotland & Ireland.
               
               
                  2. And wil conuert our Idle bellies, our Beggers, our vagabonds and Sharkes into luſty Hempbeaters, ſpinners, Carders, Rope-makers, Net-makers, Coopers, Smiths, Shipwrights, Calkers, Sawyers, Saylers, Fiſhermen, Bisket-bakers, weauers of Pole-dauis, Sayle-makers, and other good labouring Members.
               
               3. And will more warrant and incourage our Magiſtrates to punniſh the Idle, the ſturdy begger, and the Theeſe, when theſe Buſſes ſhall finde imployment for them that wil worke.
               4. And will be a meanes that the True, poore, aged, and impotent ſhal be better and more plentifully, yet more eaſily and with leſſe charges releeued, when onely ſuch ſhall ſtand at deuotion, and no valiant Rogues ſhall ſhare in the Almes of the charitable as now they do.
               5. And will helpe to bring euery one to eate their own bread.
               6. Yea, and will ſupply his Maieſt. Armies and Garriſons in time of neede with many luſty able men inſteede of our Barebreeched Beggers and naſty Sharkes, that are as vnskilfull and as vnwilling to fight as to worke.
               7. And will keepe and bring in abundance of Gold and Siluer.
               I know and confeſſe that it is not in Man to promiſe theſe or any of them peremptorily, but all theſe are the euident effects of this Fiſhery amongſt the Dutch.
               And therefore I may conclude, That we are to hope for like bleſsing, by our like lawfull and honeſt endeuors in this trade of fiſhery which almighty God hath brought home to our doores to imploy vs in, whereby he alſo giues vs a comfortable calling to the worke.
               
                  
TO begin withall, if but ſome of our Noblemen▪ and ſome of our Gentry▪ and ſome Cittizens and others of ability, each man for himſelfe, would ſpeedily prouide and imploy at leaſt one Buſſe a peece, ſo as ſome good ſtore of Buſſes may (amongeſt them in that manner bee ſpeedily prouided and imployed, to ioyne with Sir William Haruey, who is already entred the field alone. No doubt but his Maieſty will bee pleaſed (at their humble ſuite) to encourage and incorporate them with priuileges, immunities, and authority; and ſo they may chooſe amongſt themſelues, ſome meet officers and ouerſeers, and make meete lawes and orders for the due and ſeaſonable taking, curing, packing, and ſelling of the ſaide Herrings, &c. As the French and Straights Merchants who being ſo incorporated, yet haue euery man his own ſhip, or the ſhip hee hiers: and each man by himſelfe or by his Factor, goes out, returnes, buyes & ſels, not tranſgreſſing the priuate lawes and orders of their reſpectiue companies.
               But if at the firſt entrance there will not bee any competent number of Buſſes ſo prouided, and Aduentured as aboueſaid. If his Maieſty will be pleaſed ſo to incorporate ſome fit for this worke; and (out of that corporation) a ſufficient Treaſurer, and other needefull officers be here choſen & made known; then may all that pleaſe, (of whatſoeuer honeſt condition) bring in (by a day to be aſſigned) what ſum of money any ſhal like to Aduenture herein, from 5. pound, vpwards.
               And when there ſhall be brought in 70. or 80. thouſand pounds, then preſently the ſaid Officers to prouide an hundred Buſſes, which with that money will be royally built and furniſhed, and all their firſt yeares charge defrayed.
               
                  
And as more ſtocke ſhal come in, ſo alſo more Buſſes to be ſo prouided and added to thoſe former, &c. All which may bee (as in the now Eaſt India company) the ioynt ſtocke and Buſſes of the company.
               Of which Ioynt ſtocke and Buſſes, euery aduenturer according to the proportion of his ſaid Aduenture, may yearely know, giue, and receiue his proportion, as it ſhal pleaſe God to diſpoſe of the whole fleete and buſineſſe. But whereas in the ſaid Eaſt India company, and others ſuch like, as haue a common Treaſury, whereinto euery Aduenture is promiſcuouſly put, the ſaide Aduentures once brought in, are there ſtill continued in banke, and often additions cald for. In this Fiſhing company, euery Aduenturer ſhall but onely (as it were) lend the mony he aduentureth for one yeare or there abouts, as before is ſhewed.
               Now for the good gouernment and ſincere diſpoſition of this Ioynt ſtocke, &c. It would be ſpecially prouided (amongeſt other ordinances and prouiſions) that all Officers be only annuall; and that thoſe be freely choſen and yearely changed by the more voats of the company, yearely to be aſſembled for that purpoſe. And that whatſoeuer gratuities, or rewards, or fees, ſhall be yearly giuen to ſuch Officers, may (not onely in groſſe, but) in particular be diſtributed or ſet down by the more part of voyces of the company ſo aſſembled; and not one groſſe ſum giuen, bee deuided or diſtributed by any one man▪ for ſo may the company with their owne money arme and enable one man, (firſt thereby made proud) to ouer-rule and keep vnder themſelues, by binding his fellow officers to himſelfe, to the neglect of the generality, whoſe proper gifts they be, though by that ill meanes it be not acknowledged, beſides many other miſchiefes &

inconueniences, which may come by the ouerweening of one or fewe men, whileſt others of better deſerts perhaps are neglected and not looked on, to the mouing of much offence, murmur, and enuy in ſome; and of pride, inſolency and arrogancy in others.
               By this laſt mentioned promiſcuous courſe of Ioyntſtocke, after the rate of Aduenture and charge & gaine, before in particulars ſet downe, it appeares: That

                     
                        Euery Aduenturer of C li. may gaine clearly per annum.

               Surely I hope this famous Citty (euer forward for the kingdomes good) will for their part prouide and furniſh the firſt C. of Buſſes at the leaſt, and thereby according to their former noble examples, (as the creſſet of the kingdome) giue light to the reſt of the land to follow them by.
               And I thinke the Eaſt India company will liberally further this worke: for that thereby ſome of their greateſt wants are like to be ſupplied.
               I ſpeake as I thinke without inſinuation, which I hate as much as rayling.
               And I neither hope for, nor deſire any other gaine hereby, then my ſhare in the common good that all this land ſhall by Gods bleſsing reape by this buſineſſe, and the proportionable gaine of mine Aduenture therein.

               THE States generall of the Vnited Prouinces of the Low countries vnto al thoſe that ſhall ſee or heare theſe preſents greeting. Wee let to weet, that whereas it is well knowne, that the great fiſhing and catching of Herrings, is the chiefeſt Trade and principal Gold▪mine of theſe Vnited Countries, vvhereby many thouſands of Houſholds, Families, Handi-crafts trades and Occupations are ſet on worke, well maintained and proſper, eſpecially the Sailing and Nauigation, as vvell within as without theſe Countries, is kept in great eſtion. Moreouer, many Returnes of Money, with the encreaſe of the Meanes, Conuoyes, Cuſtomes, & Reuennues of theſe Countries are augmented thereby and proſper: and foraſmuch as there is made from time to time many good Orders, concerning the catching, ſalting, and beneficiall vttering of the ſaid Herrings to the end, to preſerue and maintaine the ſaid chiefe Trade in the Vnited Prouinces; which Trade, by diuers encounters of ſome that ſeeke their owne Gaine, is enuyed, in reſpect of the great good it bringeth to the vnited countries. And VVee a

                informed, that a newe deuice is put in practiſe to the preiudice of the Trade, to Tranſport

out of the Vnited Countries into other countryes, Staues for Herring-barrels made heere, and halfe Herring-barrels, put into other Barrels and Nets, to croſſe the good Orders and Policy heere intended to them of theſe Countries, for the catching, ſalting, and ſelling the Herrings, dreſſed in other countries, after the order of theſe Countries, whereby this chiefe Trade ſhould bee decayed heere, and the Inhabitants of theſe Countryes damnified, if that we make not prouiſion in time againſt ſuch practiſes. Therefore Wee, after mature Iudgement and deliberation, haue forbidden and interdicted, and by theſe Preſents doe forbid and interdict, all, and euery one, as well Home-borne and Inhabitantes, as ſtrangers frequenting theſe parts, to take vp any Herring-barrels, or halfe ones prepared, or any kind of nets in any Ship, Towne, or Hauen of the vnited Prouinces, to be ſent into other Countries or Places, vpon paine of confiſcation of the ſame, and the ſhip alſo wherein they ſhalbe found, beſides a penalty of 200. of Netherlandiſh ſiluer Royals for the firſt time, and for the ſecond time aboue confiſcation of Ship and Goods, and 400. of the ſaide Royals of ſiluer, and for the third time, aboue confiſcation of ſhip and goods, and 600. of the ſaide Royals of ſiluer▪ and corporall puniſhment: all which confiſcations and penalties ſhall be diſtributed, one third part to the profit of the Plaintife, one third part to the poor, and one third part to the Officers where the ſaide confiſcation ſhall be demanded: and not onely they ſhal incurre this penalty, which after ſhall be taken vvith the deed, but they alſo, that within one yeare after the deed ſhall bee conuicted: and that none may pretend ignorance, and that this order may be in all places duely obſerued, and the offenders puniſhed according to iuſtice:

Wee will and require, our deere and well-beloued Eſtates, Gouernors, Deputies of the councell, and the Eſtates of the reſpectiue Prouinces of Gilderland, and the county of Satfill in Holland, Weſt-Freeſland, Zeland, Vtricts, Freeſland, Merizel, the Towne of Groyning, and the circumiacent places: and to all Iuſtices and officers, that they cauſe to be publiſhed in all places, and proclaimed where the vſuall Proclamation and Publication is made: VVe do charge alſo the Chancellors and Prouinciall councell, and the councell of the Admiralty, the Aduocatiſticall and the Procurators generall, and all other Officers, Iudges, and Iuſtices of theſe Vnited Prouinces, and to all generall Colonies, Admiralles and Vice-admirals, Captaines, Officers and Commanders, to performe, and cauſe to be performed, this order and commandement, and to proceede and cauſe to be proceeded againſt the Offenders, without grace, fauour, diſſimulation or compoſition; becauſe we haue founde it neceſſary for the good and benefite of the ſaide vnited Prouinces.
