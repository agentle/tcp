               The name and notation of the DVELLO. CHAP. 1.
            
            
               THe name (for the true notation of the subiect is in no treatise to bee neglected, but the very auspicy of letter-labour, by logicke doctrine, is thence to bee taken.) of the Duello or Duellum is after some quasi duorum bellum, while others iudge that this deriuation stands rather conceited vpon the affinity of similary sound in pronunciation, then true criticisme. Authentique writers of the Latine haue Duellum vnlimited in number, and of equall large significationHorat. epist. lib. 1. ep. 2.

Merulā ad lib. 1. annal. Ennii. as Duellona and Bellona. To al these agreeeth Festus, deriuing it, quod duabus partibus de victoria contendentibus dimicatur, referring it to the contrary termes of a generall quarrel, not to that single opposition, which the French cal Combate seul a seul, the old Saxons Kamp-fight, our English single-fight, fully and significantly exprest in the Greeke

And Etymologists, ayming at the conioyned nature of the word and thing signified, as commonly misse, as hit their marke. Iustinians

               rerum gratiâ, repertasunt, quae si alio quolibet modo intelligantur, nihil interest saith the Emperor. Truth and the application of this word Duellum to single fight, haue had both one father (especially in this Kingdome where time both establisheth and abrogateth.) It were therefore iniury in mee to offer cause of

breach to their sister-hood, or to bastard the one, times hoary age being contrary to, and far from all iust imputation of naturall weaknesse.
            The Duello then (you may vse at your pleasure any of the other names) is the bodily opposition of two combatants, both ayming at victorious successe. Other and diuerse are the definitions of it among Ciuilians, which for the most part call it, not Pugna duorum, but duarum partium citra formam belli dimicantium, as vpon the example of the Horatij and Curiatij, in the Romaine historie, which exceeded vnity on both sides Doctor Beuther
               Beuther. disp. de duel. concl. 1 concludes. His definition is the last (as I take it) yet not so perfect as new. It were audacious to examine it, much more to affirme any other in all numbers absolute. Onely thus much; I see not why two or three on a side are not by power of a like continued addition, as neerely equall to Xerxes Myriads as a million, the least of numbers beingEuclidis definitio numeri 7. Elem. def. 2. as well contained vnder that

               parum est enim vt non subuerti posset. Those two parts, genus & differētia specifica, cānot be alwaies, and seldome are according to Aristotelique learning in definitions of law subiects. To conclude this, accept the names notation as your phantasie perswades, or true signification, as your iudgment directs, although (I confesse) you may possibly finde mee erring in one; which if you

correct, you may chaunce as soone to erre as another, but to your correction with respect I submit me.

Segraue was herevpon staied in his passage at Douer, committed to the Castle, and afterward in the Kingsbench confessed his fault, and submitted himselfe to the King, de alto & basso.

                  atorem S. Edwardum Angliae regem testatur vulgaris illa Cronica, quae Cronica Cronicorum intitulatur: vbi de Gulielmo Bastardo Normannorum Duce, alias Anglorum rege, loquitur dicens, quod, cum praedictus S. Edwardus ex se liberos heredes nullos haberet, Guilielmum regni heredem instituit, qui, deuicto & mortuo Haroldo regni vsurpatore, hac conditione regno liberè potitus est, vt scilicet leges prius a praefato Edwardo latas seruaret; qui quidem Edwardus leges etiam Normannis dederat, etiam cum Normannia diu fuisset enutritus. But all this perswadeth not such Antiquity of the English Duell. The old Saxon lawes of Alfred, Edward, Athelstane, Edmund, Edgar, or others of those times, are silent of any such matter; Nor, as I remember, haue the Monkish stories of

that age any authority for proofe of it. Onely in William of Malmesbury relation is made of a combat fought and a champion slaine (vpon proofe ofMalmesbur. de gest. reg. li, 2 cap, 12. the by-insimulation-wronged chastity of Gunhilda daughter to Hardknot and wife to Henry the third of Germanie) but this was out of the English territory; wherefore, although the one part was English, nothing to our purpose is hence gathered.Leg. Guil. Coq. apud Lamb. fol. 125. But in the lawes of VVilliam the first, it is decreed, that if a French-man appeale an Englishman of periury, murder, theft, mans-slaughter or robbery, Anglus se defendat per quod melius voluerit, aut iudicio ferri, 
               Ferri nimirum igniti, cuius formam explicatissime babes in Antiq. Eccles. Brit. & in Lamb. expli. verb. 
               aut Duello. It rests therefore, that wee admit that the Normans, alias North mans (being by their first ofspring from the Norwegian coast, where this custome as before is shewed, had his breeding) were the first authors of it in this their conquered kingdome.
         
         
            The diuision of the Duell iudiciall as of iudgements; the forme out of the Common law till the lists intred (with authority and examples) of the Criminall Duell. Chap. 7.
            
            GEnerally it being thus from the antients brought into England, what followes of it also shalbe within England chiefely confined. AsCicer in orat. pro Cecinna. the diuision of iudgements is bipartite, consisting

eyther in punishment of misdeedes committed against the body of the state, or determination of controuersies touching onely particular persons, which in fewest wordes is expressed by Publike and Priuate, Criminall and Ciuill; so (if the Tryall may be denominated from the iudgement,) the same distinction may bee admitted in the Duell, to bee eyther Criminall or Ciuil: Criminall beeing waged for purgation of an imputed Crime, Ciuill when for deciding of controuersie touching priuate wronges or interests.
            Particularly for the first, the offences (which are comprehended vnder the name of felony, which is Capitall) of Treason (when appeales of Treason were admitted) Murder Robery, or such like, haue from ancient time in Appeales beene tryable at the Defendants pleasure by the Duell.

VVhen the Defendant hath made choyce of this purgation or tryall, presently (according to those Auncients) so that exception intercede not, surety is giuen on both partes; on the Defendants for performing his defence by his

body, on the Appellants for deraigning the battell; where-vppon day is giuen by the Court for prouision of their martiall accout rements, and arraying them-selues in conuenient armes (the Defendant continually remayning in safe custody;) At the day prefixt, both parties prepared and appearing in Court, the Apellant recites his appeale, and the Defendant his former defence, verbatim, as at the first. Then the one takes the other by the hand, and the defendant with an oath thus prepares his stomacke to the field.

To which the Appellant replies.
            
               This heare you whome I hold by the hand, which say you are called by the Christian name of Peter that you are forsworne, and therefore for sworne, because such a yeare, such a day, and in such a place, you did felloniously with mallice prepensed, with such a kinde of weapon giue a deadly wound in such a place of the body of Thomas my father, whereby hee dyed within one houre after▪ as I haue before said against you, so helpe mee God and the Saintes.
            
            
               These oathes in effect are composed of the somewhat different formes in Bracton and Britton; but as agreeing to both; onely thus much is the diuersity. Bracton addes at the close of the first, Nec tu hoc vidisti, and to answer it the appellant thus encounters him, & ego vidi, which Britton hath not. The reason seemes, because that after Hen. the 3. his time, wherein Bracton wrote the Statute of Westmin. the 1. in taking awayVVest. 1. cap. 41. that particle of Champions oathes in tryall of priuate rightes, was (as I thinke) by equity extended vnto appeales also, as ensuing presidents offer perswasion.
            In this forme (by my former authority) their mutual oathes taken, the defendant is committed to the custody of two Knightes, or men of meaner fashion, secund

                  m quod appellatus nobilis fuerit persona vel ignobilis, who must conduct him vnto the listes, (appointed and ordered by the Marshall at commaundement of the Iudges,) so likewise is the appellant ordered, and both restrained from speach with any, except their Knightes, and the Iustices, who before the battell receiue seuerall oathes of them in this forme. This Heare you Iustices that I Peter haue neyther eaten, nor dranke, nor any other thing done or caused for mee to bee done whence GODS lawe might bee depressed and the Diuels aduanced so helpe mee GOD. Et issint (sayth Iohn Britton) soit fait En toutes les battailes de felony. Immediately followes

the Kings proclamation, that no man bee so hardy or bold (other then the Combatants) whatsoeuer hee see or heare, asto moue, or speake loud whereby any disturbance may happen to the battell, vnder paine of a yeare and a dayes imprisonment.
            
            Thus stand the Combatans ready in the listes as they are by those auncient Writers marshalled. But before their battell (to auoyd error in the proceeding, because some differences appeare,) an example or two of later times in Our Common lawe Annalls is to be obserued.

Two main-pernours, body for body, were taken for the Appellants performance on the 3. day following; the Defendant committed to the Marshall with charge to haue him ready armed on the same day also, the costs of all imposed on the parties. All this was at the first appearance and pleading, and differs from Bracton, especially in that point as also the next following.

The Appellant found two pledges for the battell, the time appointed and place in Tuthill fieldes, The defendant committed to the Marshals custody; Charge giuen to the Apellant that the night before the battellday hee should repaire to the Marshall to bee arrayed, so that hee might bee in the field by the sunne rising of the same day; to both, to bee then ready to performe their deuoires.

Thomas of Catrington defendant, appeare to defend thy cause, for which Sir Iohn of Ansley Knight and appellant hath publiquely & in writing appealed thee. and thus thrise by an Herehault. At the third proclamation, the Esquire appeares mounted on a steed stratum regulariter stramentis praeferentibus arma dicti Thomae, who, when hee approached the lists, dismounted himselfe, ne iuxta consuetudines praelij Constabularius vendicaret equum si limites fuisset ingressus, sed nil sibi valet astutia sua, nam equus iuxta list as discurrens aliquoties totum caput et pectus iniecit vltra limites. Ob quam causam Constabularius Thomas de Woodstock equum vendicauit, iurans se velle caput eius habere. viz. quantum inter listas de equo visum fuit, vnde adiudicatus est ei equus. The Esquire entring the lists on foote, the constable & Marshall produce a certaine Indenture made before them, by consent of the parties, conteining the articles of the accusation, which were there publiquely read. Catrington began to offer exception at some of them, thereby thinking to haue some-what extenuated the blottes laide on him. But the Duke of Lancaster seeing him in delayes, with an oath openly menaced him, that vnlesse according to the Duello-lawes hee would admitte all in the indenture, which was drawne by his assent, as free from beeing taxt for

insufficiency of forme, hee should bee presently drawne and hanged as a traitor. Wherevpon the Squire ceased from his exceptions, and entended onely the Combat. Sir Iohn Ansley, provt moris est, (saith Walsingham) and after him this Catrington, tooke oath of the truth of his cause, that hee was free from all vse of Art Magique, that he did not carry with him any hearbe, stone, or other kinde of experiment of Witchcra

The Squire had still the worst, euen vntill Ansley, although with some hazard and doubt, (as you may see in the Author) got the adiudged victory.

Parliament then holden, a Combat was fought betweene one Mortileto de Vilenos a Nauarrois appellant, and an English Esquire called Iohn Walsh defendant: the accusation was of treason, but the truth was, that the chiefe motiue of Mortileto's quarrell (as him-selfe afterwards ouercome confessed) was a former discouered close combat betweene his wife and the Squire.

            Out of these examples may bee gathered some particulers of our Duello-ceremonies not to bee neglected. But, because a difference appeares

Yet vpon obseruation of all this seeming contrary testimony, the Truth will be thus apparant. That when the Appeale is vpon matter disgracefull, or dishonorable to nobility, or the accusation in such forme of termes & place, as cannot be sufficient ground of an Appeale by Common-law course, as when the matter (I speake especially of Criminalls

or armory) is not emergent within the Realme, then if the Combat bee challenged, the Naturall Iudges are those two Noble Officers, the high Constable and Marshall of England, to whome belong from Antiquity a Court called le Court de Chiualry, ad lites honorartas (as a late writerMill. de nobilit. politic. pag. 154. saith) discutiendas, ius

               Priuate wronges determined by the Duell, and they eyther touching Armes and Gentry or Right of Land-inheritance. Cap. 12.
            
            OVr diuision hath his other part of trials of priuate rights and interests, which are either touching Gentry and bearing of coat-armour & such

like or concerning right of demesnes & inheritance.
            
            The first of these are vpon controuersies of such nature as were betweene the Lord Grey of Ruthen and Sir Edward Hastings vnder Hen. theMill de pol. nob. pag. 153. third, for the coate of the family of the Hastings: betweene the Lords Louel and Morley, for the bearing of the Burnells: Richard Scroope, and Robert Grauenor vnder Richard the second. Examples of such titles to ensignes of Nobility tried by proofe on body are that of Sir Iohn Chandos anBosewell in lib. heraldic. sol. 79 English Knight, and the Lord del Cleremount a French-man for bearing the image of our Lady, with her child standing in the Sunne, which by righte of armes after the battell of Poitiers is reported to bee wonne by the English man-hood; and that of Hugh Vaughan Gentleman-Vsher to Henry the seauenth and Sir Iames Parker slaine at

As these causes and the like, which concerne the differences arising twixt Gentlemen for their bearing, are determinable in the court of Chiualry, so the Duel on them waged is before the same iudges, in such sort as is before shewed, (with respectiue sentence) to bee managed and performed.
            The respect, which antiquity in this Kingdome gaue to the trial of right of enheritance by bodily opposition, may be gathered from that old Tenure by which the manner of Scriuelby in Lincolnshire was long since (and for ought I know) is yet holden: viz. by graund serieanty, that at the inauguration

            Combats vpon right of enheritance in land-possessions, how granted, prepared, and determined: with iudgment on them. Chap. 13.
            
            THe antientest Combat offered in such ciuill causes, that I haue read of, was in Richard Ceur de Lions time, to one William Basset, vpon demand by one Emme de P. of a Knights fee in Corfeton inMich. 6. Rich. 1. rot. 3. ap west. Wiltshire, where Willielmus dicit quod sunt de vno stipite & ideo non debet inde probari.

Thus it seemes in those dayes it was the course for the demandant, to offer his proofe in his Count at the Barre by the body of his free-man, but so that it rested alwaies in election of the tenant (so the Lawiers call the defendant in such case) to ioyne issue vpon the offer, or cast all vpon the Kings graund assise; as the same author more largely declares. But the forme

since those times (and that most frequent in the Law
                  •
               annalls) hath beene to omitt the offer of the battell in the Count, in lieu whereof a generall clause of tendering suit and proofe, is the common inserted conclusion; herevpon the Tenant (with formall defence of his right premitted) answers: and this right he is ready to prooue by the body either of himselfe or his free-man there present, with such ensuing words, as after Glanduills description, the demaundant concluded his Count with. If exception hinder not, the demandant replyes (with allowance of emparlance to prepare his champion) recounting his first declared right, that hee is ready to prooue the same by his owne or the body of his free-man there present, with particular names, and formality of pleading pursued.

The Court further demaunds of the demaundants champion, Will you vpon this right aduenture your body? hee affirming: his aduersaries gloue (so I vnderstand it) is deliuered to him, & respectiuely in like sort the other is ordered; with a commandement for re-deliuery of the gloues. At the

same time, or (if the Court thinke fitte, at some other day giuen) the champion of the tenant is commanded to come ouer the barre into the Court, bare-head, vngirt, vncloakt and bare-foote, and commanded to kneele downe on the left side; the other champion likwise in euery respect, and kneeles on the right side; the court demands of the Serieants if they know any thing why these champions are not fit for the combat? Which admitted, the gloues are redeliuered to them, within euery finger a penny (which they were commanded by Iustice Thorp to offer en l'honneur des cinque plates que dieu suffre.) Nothing being mooued touching misioyning the issue, or mispleading, iudgement is giuen with Cest Court agard que la battaile soit, such a day next comming, with place conuenient appointed. The Champions were wont to bee sent to seuerall churches, there to inuoake the aide of some Saints to the assistance of their victory, with charge also, that they be not suffered in the meane time, to haue any speech together before the lists entred. The Champions find pledges for their performances; the parties take charge to haue them prepared fit for the combat against the day apointed. Lists are made in some spatious plaine, some twenty paces square, with a tribunall for the Iudges adioyning; into which at the prefixed time after the court set, and by proclamation fi

The selfe same ceremonies of proclamation and oath, as in a criminall Duell before the Iustices aboue recited, here vsed, nothing remaines but the next succeeding hand-strokes. I obserue to you by the way, that in an old manuscript of P. 6. Ed. 2▪ in a writ of right betweene Thomas of Ailesthorp against the Abbot of Fountaignes, the Champion was brought to the bar in the before declared order, and also descheuilé oue vn paire des gaunts plies en son maine dextre.

               Vpon determination of this combat, as in the other of appeales, finall and peremptory iudgement is to be giuen, (quae enim (saith Glanuill) per

            With short recapitulation thus I conclude; that, from antiquity Combats of all sorts haue proceeded; that from the Lumbards and Northerne people, whose posterity filled this Kingdoms cōtinēt, the

iudiciall sort were hither first deriued; that ye causes were either criminal or ciuil, & both of different natures, and belonging to different iurisdictions, and so by seueral formes of Combat haue bin of right triable; which formes in generall view are here described. Of particular exceptions to the Appellants, or sauing defaults in the one, or to the Champions or cause-selfe in the other, or any of them, the treatise is too particularly disposed for the designe of this collection; which aimes wholy at the general nature, and forme, & antiquity of the Duello performed, omitting to those which haue largely discoursed it al interposed obstacles and nicetyes of inquisition?
