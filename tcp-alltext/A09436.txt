and vertuous Lady

of Cumberland,
Grace and Peace.
            RIght Honourable, the
kingdome of heauen, of
which the scripture speaketh
so oft, is properly
a certaine state or condition,
whereby wee stand in the fauour
and loue of God, in and by
Christ. And this kingdome is
compared to a Graine of Musterd-seede,
to teach vs that a
man is euen at that instant alreadie
entred into the kingdome
of heauen, when the Lord that
good husbandman hath cast but
some little portion of faith or
repentance into the ground of
the heart; yea, though it be but

as one graine of musterd-seede.
Of this little graine I haue penned
this Treatise, in quantitie
answerable thereto: and I now
present the same to your Ladishippe,
not to supplie your want,
(for I hope you are stored with
many graines of this kinde) but
to performe some dutie on my
part. Hoping therefore that
your Ladiship will read and accept
the same, I take my leaue,
commending you to the blessing
and protection of the Almightie.

            A GRAINE
of Musterd-seede, Or, the
least measure of grace, that
is, or can be effectuall
to Saluation.
            IT is a very necessary point
to be knowne, what is the
least measure of grace that
can befall the true childe of
God, lesser then which, there is
no grace effectuall to saluation.
For first of all, the right vnderstanding
of this point, is
the very foundation of true
comfort vnto all troubled &
touched cōsciences. Secondly,
it is a notable meanes to

stirre vp thankefulnesse in
them that haue any grace at
all; when they shall in examination
of then selues consider,
that they haue receiued
of God the least measure of
grace, or more. Thirdly, it
will be an inducement, and a
spurre vnto many carelesse
and vnrepentant persons, to
embrace the gospel, and to
beginne repentance for their
sinnes; when they shall perceiue,
and that by the word
of God, that God accepts
the very seeds and rudiments
of faith and repentance at
the first, though they be but
in measure as a Graine of
Musterd-seed. Now then for
opening and clearing of
this point: I will set downe
fiue seuerall conclusions, in

such order as one shall confirme
and explane the other,
and one depend vpon the other.
            
               I. Conclusion.
               A man that doth but beginne to
be conuerted, is euen at that
instant, the very child of God,
though inwardly hee be more
carnall then spirituall.
               
                  The Exposition.
                  IN a man there must be cō
                     sidered
three things, the
substance of the body and
soule, whereof man is saide
to consist; the faculties placed
in the soule and exercised
in the body, as vnderstanding,
will, affections: the integritie

tegritie and puritie of the faculties,
whereby they are cō
                     formable
to the will of God
and beare his Image. And
since the fall of Adam, man is
not depriued of his substance
or of the powers and faculties
of his soule, but onely of
the third, which is the puritie,
or integritie of nature.
And therfore the conuersion
of a sinner, whereof the conclusion
speaketh, is not the
change of the substance of
man, or of the faculties of the
soule: but a renewing and restoring
of that puritie and
holinesse which was lost by
mans fall, with the abolishment
of that natural corruption
that is in all the powers
of the soule. This is the
worke of God, and of God

alone, and that on this manner.
First of all, when it pleaseth
God to worke a change
in any, he doth it not first in
one part, then afterward in another,
as hee that repaires a
decaied house by peecemeale:
but the worke, both
for the beginning, continuance,
and accomplishment, is
in the whole man, and euery
part at once, specially in the
minde, conscience, will, and
affections: as on the cōtrary,
when Adam lost the image of
God, he lost it in euery part.
Secondly, the cōuersion of a
sinner is not wrought all at
one instant, but in continuance
of time: & that by certaine
measures and degrees.
And a man is then in the
first degree of his conuersion

when the holy Ghost by the
meanes of the word, inspires
him with some spirituall motions,
& begins to regenerate
and renew the inward powers
of his soule. And he may
in this case very fitly be compared
to the night in the
first dawning of the day, in
which though the darkenes
remaine and be more in quā
                     tity
then the light, yet the sun
hath alreadie cast some beames
of light into the aire,
whereupon we tearme it the
breaking of the day. Now
then, the very point which I
teach, is that a man at this instant,
and in this very state
(God as yet hauing but laid
certen beginnings of true cō
                     uersion
in his heart) is the very
child of God, and that not

only in the eternall purpose
of God (as all the elect are)
but indeed by actuall adoption:
and this is plain by a manifest
reason: There be foure
speciall workes of grace in euery
child of God: his vnion
with Christ, his adoption, iustification,
and conuersion: &
these foure are wrought al at
one instant, so as for order of
time, neither goes before nor
after other: and yet in regard
of order of nature, vnion
with Christ, Iustification, and
adoption, goe before the
inward conuersion of a sinner,
it beeing the fruit and
effect of all. Vpon this
it followeth necessarily, that
a sinner in the very first act of
his conuersion, is iustified, adopted,
and incorporated

into the misticall bodie of
Christ. In the Parable of the
prodigall sonne, the father
with ioy receiues his wicked
child; but when? surely when
he saw him comming a farre
off, and when as yet he had
made no confession or humiliation
to his father, but onely
had conceiued with himselfe
a purpose to returne
and to say, Father I haue
sinned against heauen and against
thee, &c. And Paul
saith of many of the Corinthians,
that he could not
speake vnto them as spiritual
men, but as carnall, euē babes
in Christ, 1. Cor. 3. 1. When
Dauid reprooued by Nathan
did but begin to repent and
to say, I haue sinned, presently
Nathan the Prophet of the

Lord said, The Lord hath taken
away thy sin, Of this thing
Dauid seemes to speake in
the 32. Psal. v. 5. I said [that is,
I purposed and thought with
my selfe] I will confesse against
my selfe mine vnrighteousnesse,
and thou forgauest mine iniquities.
Vpon these words Augustine
saith, Marke, he doth
not confesse, but promiseth to
confesse, & God forgiueth him.
Againe, There be (saith he)
three syllables, peccaui, I haue
sinned: and from these three
syllables the flame of a sacrifice
did ascend into heauen before
God. Chrysostome saith, Say
thou hast sinned: and thou hast
loosed thy sinne. And Ambrose
saith: If he said, I will confesse,
and obtained pardon before he
confessed, how much more when

he had confessed, saying, I know
mine iniquitie, was his sinne pardoned▪
                     
Gregorie on this Psal.
saith, Marke how speedily pardon
comes, and how great is the
commendation of Gods mercie,
in that pardon comes together
with the desire of confession, and
remission comes to the heart,
before confession breake forth in
speech.
                  
               
            
            
               II. Conclusion.
               The first materiall beginnings
of the conuersion of a sinner,
ar the smallest measure ofrenewing
grace, haue the promises
of this life, and the life
to come.
               
                  The Exposition.
                  THe beginnings of conuersion
must be distinguished.
Some are beginnings

of preparation, some beginnings
of composition. Beginnings
of preparation are such
as bring vnder, tame, & subdue
the stubbernes of mans
nature: without making any
change at all: of this sort are
the accusations of the conscience
by the ministerie of the
law, feares and terrours arising
thence, compunction of
heart, which is the apprehension
of Gods anger against
sinne. Nowe these and the
like, I exclude in the conclusion;
for though they goe before
to prepare a sinner to
his conuersion following, yet
are they no graces of God,
but fruits both of the law, being
the ministery of death, as
also of an accusing conscience.
Beginnings of composition

I tearme all those inward
motions and inclinations
of Gods spirit, that follow
after the worke of the
law vpon the conscience, and
rise vpon the meditation of
the Gospell, that promiseth
righteousnes and life euerlasting
by Christ: out of which
motions the conuersion of a
sinner ariseth, and of which it
consisteth: what these are, it
shall afterward appeare. Againe,
grace must be distinguished:
it is two-fold; restraining
grace, or renuing grace.
Restraining grace, I tearme
certaine common gifts, of
God, seruing onely to order
and frame the outward conuersation
of men to the Law
of God, or seruing to bereaue
men of excuse in the day of

iudgement. By this kind of
grace, heathen men haue bin
liberall, iust, sober, valiant, &
mercifull. By it men liuing in
the Church of God, haue
beene inlightned, and hauing
tasted of the good word
of God, haue reioyced therein,
and for a time outwardly
conformed themselues therto.
Renewing grace is not
common to al men, but proper
to the elect, & it is a gift
of Gods spirit, whereby the
corruption of a sinner is not
only restrained, but also mortified,
and the decaied image
of God restored in righteousnes
and true holines. Now
then the conclusiō must only
be vnderstoode of the second,
and not of the first: for
though a man haue neuer so

much of this restraining
grace, yet vnlesse he haue the
spirit of Christ to create faith
in the heart, and to sanctifie
him, he is as farre from saluation
as another. Thus then
the sense and meaning of the
conclusion is, that the verie
lest measure of sauing grace,
and the verie beginning or
seedes of regeneration doe
declare, and after a sort giue
title to men, of all the mercifull
promises of God, whether
they concern this life or
the life to come: & are therefore
approoued of God, if
they be in truth; and accepted
as greater measures of grace.
That which our Sauiour
Christ saith of the worke of
miracles, Math. 17. 20. If ye
haue faith as a graine of Musterd-seede,

ye shall say vnto this
mountaine, remooue hence to
yonder place, and it shall remooue,
must by the law of equall
proportion be applied
to sauing faith, repentance,
the feare of God, and all other
graces? if they be truly
wrought in the heart, though
they be but as smal as one little
graine of Musterd-seede,
they shall be sufficiently effectuall
to bring forth good
workes, for which they are
ordained. The prophet Esay
42. 3. saith, that Christ shall
not quench the smoking flaxe,
nor breake the bruised reede,
Let the comparison be marked:
fire in flaxe must be
both little and weake in quā
                     titie
as a sparke or twain, that
cannot cause a flame, but only

a smoke, specially in a matter
so easie to burne. Here thē
is signified, that the gifts and
graces of Gods spirit, that are
both for measure & strength
as a sparke or twaine of fire,
shal not be neglected, but rather
accepted and cherished
by Christ. When our Sauiour
Christ heard the young
man make a confession of a
practise but of outward and
ciuill righteousnesse, he looked
vpon him and loued him: Mark.
10. 21. and when he heard the
scribe to speake discreetely
but one good speech, that
to loue god with all the heart
is aboue all sacrifices, he said
vnto him. That he was not for
from the kingdome of heauen.
Therefore no doubt, he will
loue with a more speciall

loue, and accept as the good
subiects of his kingdome,
those that haue receiued a
further mercie of God, to be
borne a new of water and the
spirit.
               
            
            
               III. Conclusion.
               A constant and earnest desire to
be reconciled to God, to beleeue,
and to repent, if it be
in a touched heart, is in acceptation
with God, as reconciliation,
faith, repentance it
selfe.
               
                  The Exposition.
                  LVst or desire is two folde,
naturall, & supernaturall.
Naturall is that whose beginnings
and obiect is in nature,

that is, which ariseth of the
naturall will of man, and affecteth
such things as are
thought to be good according
to the light of nature.
And this kind of desire hath
his degrees, yet so as they are
all limited within the compasse
of nature. Some desire
riches, honours, pleasures,
some learning & knowledge,
because it is the light and perfection
of the minde: some
go further & seeke after the
vertues of iustice, temperāce,
liberality, &c. and thus many
heathen men haue excelled.
Some againe desire true happinesse,
as Balaam did, who
wished to die the death of the
righteous: because it is the
propertie of nature to seeke
the preseruation of it selfe

But here nature staies it selfe:
for where the mind reueales
not, the will affects not. Supernaturall
desires, are such
as both for their beginning
and obiect, are aboue nature.
For their beginning is from
the holy Ghost; and the obiect
or matter about which
they are cōuersant, are things
diuine and spirituall which
concerne the kingdome of
heauen: and of this kinde are
the desires of which I speake
in this place. Againe, that we
may not be deceiued in our
desires, but may the better
discerne thē from flittering
and fleeting motions, I adde
three restraints. First of all,
the desire of reconciliation,
the desire to beleeue, or the
desire to repent &c. must be

constant and haue continuance,
otherwise it may iustly
be suspected. Secōdly, it must
be earnest & serious, though
not alwaies, yet at somtimes,
that we may be able to say,
with Dauid, My soule desireth
after thee, O Lord, as the
thirsty land. And, as the hart
braieth after the riuers of water,
so panteth my soule after
thee O God, my soule thirsteth
for God, euen the liuing
God. Thirdly, it must
be in a touched heart; for
when a man is touched in
conscience, the heart is cast
downe, and (as much as it
can) it withdrawes it selfe frō
God. For this cause, if then
there be any spirituall motions
whereby the heart is lift
vp vnto God they are without

doubt from the spirit of
God. Thus then I auouch,
that the desire of reconciliation
with God in Christ, is reconciliation
it selfe: the desire
to beleeue, is faith indeede: &
the desire to repent, repentance
it selfe. But marke how.
A desire to be reconciled, is
not reconciliation in nature,
(for the desire is one thing, &
reconciliation is another) but
in Gods acceptation: for if
we being touched throughly
for our sins, do desire to haue
them pardoned, and to bee at
one with god, God accepts vs
as reconciled. Againe, desire
to beleeue, it is not faith in
nature, but onely in Gods acceptation,
God accepting the
will for the deede. That this
doctrine is the will and word

of God, it appeares by these
reasons. First of all, God hath
annexed a promise of blessednes,
& of life euerlasting,
to the desire of grace. Mat.
5. Blessed are they which hunger
and thirst after righteousnesse,
for they shall bee satisfied
Ioh. 7. 38. If any man thirst, let
him come to mee and drinke.
Reuel. 2. 1. I will giue vnto him
which is a thirst, of the well of
the water of life freely. Now
what is this to thirst? properly
it is, when wee are in a
drought or drines, and want
drinke to refresh vs, & desire
it. And therefore by all resemblance,
they are saide to
thirst after righteousnes, that
want it, and would faine haue
it: And they thirst after christ
that feele themselues out of

Christ, and desire, yea long
after the blood of Christ, that
they might be refreshed with
it in their consciences. Here
then we see, that the desire of
mercy, in the want of mercy,
is the obtaining of mercie:
and the desire to beleeue, in
the want of faith, is faith.
Marke then: though as yet
thou want firme and liuely
grace, yet art thou not altogether
voide of grace, if thou
canst vnfainedly desire it, thy
desire is the seede, conception,
or bud of that which thou
wantest. Now is the springtime
of the ingrafted word or
the immortall seede cast into
the furrowes of thy heart:
waite but a while, vsing the
good meanes to this ende appointed,
and thou shalt see

the leaues, blossomes, & fruit
will shortly follow after. Secōdly,
the desire of any good
thing is accepted of God, as
the liuely inuocation of his
holy name, Psal. 10. God heareth
the desire of the poore. Psal.
145. He will fulfill the desire of
him that feareth him. When
Moses said nothing, but onely
desired in heart the helpe
and protection of God at the
redde sea, the Lord said vnto
him, Why criest thou vnto
me? Exod. 14. 15. And when
wee know not to pray as wee
ought, Paul saith, that the
spirit maketh request by the
inward groanes of the heart,
Rom. 8. 26. Hence I gather,
that when a man in his weaknesse
praies with sighes and
groanes, for the gift of liuely

faith, the want whereof hee
findes in himselfe, his very
praier on this manner made,
is as truly in acceptation with
God, as a praier made in
liuely faith. And here it is
further to be considered, that
Paul calls these groanes vnspeakable,
and why? Of most
interpreters they are thought
to be vnspeakable, by reason
of their greatnesse, and this
I will not denie: it seemes
neuerthelesse that they are
so tearmed by reason of
their weakenesse, for they
are commonly small, weake,
and confused in the hearts of
Gods children when they
are distressed: and the words
following seeme to import
thus much: for when it had
beene said that Gods spirit in

vs makes request with grones
not to be vttered: some man
might happily reply and say,
if we cannot discerne and vtter
these grones in our selues
what are we the better? Paul
addes therfore, that although
we know not, yet God a searcher
of all things hidden in
the heart, knowes the minde
and meaning of the spirit.
And thus the wordes yet further
afoard a comfortable instruction
to the children of
God, namely, that beeing in
distresse, whether in life or
death, if by grace we can but
sigh or sob vnto God, though
it be weake and feeble like the
faint pulse in the time of
death; we, or the spirit of God
in vs, doe indeede make request
vnto God that shall bee

heard, yea, (as the words are)
wee doe more then make request:
and though we do not
alwaies see what Gods spirit
makes vs to sigh after, yet god
doeth. To the testimonie of
Scripture, I adde the testimonies
of godly and learned
men, not to prooue the doctrine
in hand; but to shew a
consent, and to prooue thus
much, that the thing which I
auouch, is no priuate phantasie
of any man Easily (saith
Ambrose of God) is he reconciled,
                     Lib. 7. in Luc. c. 66.
                     Si impensè rogatur. on Psal. 36.
                     if he be instantly intreated.
Augustine saith, Let thy
desire be before him, and thy father
which seeth in secret shall
reward thee openly: for thy desire
is thy praier, and if thy desire
be continuall, thy praier is continuall.
Hee addes further in

the same place, that the desire
is a continuall voice, and the cry
of the heart, and the inward inuocation
of God, which may be
made without intermission, Againe,
To desire the helpe of
grace is the beginning of grace.

                     The whole life of a
good Christian, is an holy will

Bernard saith, what, is

strong voice. God heareth the

any groane. For Paul saith, that

Againe, Very fewe know, how
weake and small faith and hope
is, vnder the crosse, and in temptation.
For it appeares, then to
bee as smoking flaxe, which a
good blast of winde would praesently
put out: but such as beleeue
in these combates, and terrours
against hope, vnder hope,
that is, opposing themselues by
faith in the promise of Christ, against
the feeling of sinne, and
the wrath of God, doe finde afterward
that this litle sparke of
faith (as it appeares to reason,

which hardly perceiueth it) is
peraduenture as the whole element
of fire which filleth all
heauen and swalloweth vp all
terrours and sinnes.

and the lesse wee finde

doth greatly please God, who
desireth and willeth that his
grace should bee earnestly desired.
This doeth faith, which
iudgeth it a pretious thing, and
therefore greatly hungreth and
thirsteth after it, and so obtaines
it. For God is delighted to
fill the hungrie with good things,
& to send the rich emptie away.

desire, and a striuing against
his naturall doubtings, both can
and must assure himselfe that he
is indued with true faith. Againe,
Wicked men doe not desire
the grace of the holy spirit,
whereby they may resist sinne.
And therefore they are iustly
depriued of it: for hee that earnestly
desireth the holy Ghost

hath it alreadie: because this
desire of the spirit cannot be but
from the spirit: as it is saide,
Blessed are they that hunger
and thirst after righteousnesse,
for they shall bee satisfied.Epistle to Carelesse.
Bradford saith, Thy sins
are vndoubtedly pardoned, &c.

the will for thee deede) for a penitent
and beleeuing heart indeede.
                     Booke of the markes of Gods children.
Taffine saith, Our
faith may be so small and weake
as it doth not yet bring forth
fruits, that may bee liuely felt of
vs, but if they which feele themselues
in such estate, desire to
haue these feelings [namely, of
Gods fauour and loue] if they

aske them at Gods hands by
praier: this desire and praier are
testimonies that the spirit of
God is in them, and that they
haue faith alreadie: for, is such
a desire, a fruit of the flesh, or of
the spirit? it is of the holy spirit,
who bringeth it forth onely in
such as hee dwells in, &c. Then
these holy desires and praiers being
the motions of the holy Ghost
in vs, are testimonies of our
faith, although they seeme to
vs small and weake. As the woman
that feeleth the moouing
of a childe in her body, though
very weake, assureth her selfe
that shee hath conceiued, and
that shee goeth with a liue child,
so if wee haue these motions,
these holy affections, and desires
beforementioned, let vs not
doubt but that wee haue the

holy Ghost (who is the author of
them) dwelling in vs, and consequently
that we haue also faith.
Again he saith, 1. If thou hast
begun to hate and she sinne, 2.
If thou feelest that thou art displeased
at thine infirmities, and
corruptions: 3. If hauing offended
God thou feelest a griefe,
and a sorrow for it: 4. If thou desire
to abstaine: 5. If thou auoidest
the occasion: 6. If thou
trauailest to doe thy endeauour:
7. If thou praiest to God
to giue thee grace: all these holy
affections, proceeding from none
other then from the spirit of
God, ought to be so many pledges,
and testimonies that he is in
thee. (n) Masterknockes saith,
Albeit your paines sometimes be
so horrible that you finde no release
nor comfort, neither in

spirit nor bodie, yet if they heart
can onely sob vnto God, despaire
not, you shall obtaine your hearts
desire. And destitute you are not
of faith: for at such a time as the
flesh, naturall reason, the law of
God, the present torment, the
diuell at one doe crie, God is angrie,
and therefore there is neither
helpe nor remedie to be hoped
for at his hāds: at such time,
Isay, to sob vnto God, is the
demonstration of the secret
seede of God, which is hidden in
Gods elect children: and that
onely sob is vnto God a more
acceptable sacrifice, then without
this crosse, to giue our bodies
to be burnt euen for the truthes
sake. More testimonies might
be alleadged, but these shall
suffice.
                  Against this point of dotrine

it may be alleadged, that
if desire to beleeue in our
weakenesse be faith indeede;
then some are iustified and
may be saued wanting a liuely
apprehension and full perswasion
of Gods mercie in
Christ. Ans. Iustifying faith in
regard of his nature is alwaies
one and the same, and
the essentiall propertie thereof,
is, to apprehend Christ
with his benefites, and to assure
the very cōscience thereof.
And therefore without
some apprehension and assurance,
there can bee no iustification
or Saluation in them
that for age are able to beleeue.
Yet there bee certaine
degrees and measures of true
faith. There is a strong faith,
which causeth a full apprehension

and perswasion of
Gods mercie in Christ. This
measure of faith the Lord
vouchsafed Abraham, Dauid,
Paul, the Prophets, Apostles,
and Martyrs of God.
It were a blessed thing if all
beleeuers might attaine to
this height of liuely faith, to
say with Paul, I am perswaded,
that neither life, nor
death, nor any thing else, shal
bee able to separate vs from
the loue of God in Christ:
but all cannot; therfore there
is another degree of faith
lower then the former, and
yet true faith, called a litle or
weake faith, and it also hath a
power to apprehend and applie
the promise of saluation,
but as yet by reason of weaknes,
it is infolded (as it were)

and wrapt vp in the heart, as
the leafe and blossome in the
bud. For such persons as haue
this weake faith, can say indeede,
that they beleeue their
sinnes to be pardonable, and
that seriously in their hearts
they desire to haue them pardoned:
but as yet they can
not say, that they are without
all doubt pordoned. And yet
the mercie of God is not wā
                     ting
vnto them. For in that
they doe, and can desire, and
indeauour to apprehēd, they
doe indeed apprehend; God
accepting the desire to doe
the thing, for the thing done,
This which I say will the better
appeare, if the groundes
thereof be considered. Faith
doth not iustifie in respect of
it selfe, because it is an action

or vertue: or because it is
strong, liuely, and perfect: but
in respect of the obiect thereof,
namely Christ crucified,
whom faith apprehendeth
as he is set forth vnto vs in the
word and Sacraments. It is
Christ that is the author, and
matter of our iustice, and it is
he that applieth the same vnto
vs: as for faith in vs, it is but
an Instrument to apprehend
& receiue that which Christ
for his part offereth and giueth.
Therefore, if faith erre
not in his proper obiect,
but follow the promise of
God, though it doe but
weakely apprehend, or at the
least, cause a man onely to
Endeauour and Desire to apprehend,
it is true faith, and
iustifieth. Though our apprehension

be necessarie, yet
our saluation stands rather in
this, that God apprehends vs
for his owne, then that we
apprehend him for ours. Phi.
3. v. 12. And rather in this,
that we are knowne of him,
then that we know him. Gal. 4. 9.
                  
                     Out of this conclusion springs an
other not to be omitted, that
God accepts the endeauour
of the whole man to obey, for
perfect obedience it selfe.
                     THat is, if men endeauour
to please God in all
things, God will not iudge
their doings by the rigour of
his law: but will accept their
litle and weake endeauour, to
do that which they can do by

his grace, as if they had perfectly
fulfilled the lawe. But
heere remember I put this
caueat; that this indeeuour
must bee in and by the whole
man; the very minde, conscience,
will, and affections
doing that which they can in
their kindes: and thus the endeauour
to obey which is a
fruit of the spirit, shall bee
distinguished from ciuil righteousnesse,
which may bee in
heathen men, and is onely in
the outward, and not in the
inward man. The trueth of
this conclusion appeares by
that which the Prophet Malachi
saith, that God will spare
thē that feare him, as a father
spares his childe: who accepts
the thing done, as well done,
if the child shew his good will

to please his father, and to
doe what he can.
                  
               
            
            
               IV. Conclusion.
               To see and feele in our selues
the want of any grace pertaining
to saluation, and to be
grieued therefore, is the grace
it selfe.
               
                  The Exposition.
                  VNderstand this conclusion
as the former, namely
that griefe of the hart for the
want of any grace necessarie
to saluation, is as much with
god as the grace it selfe. Whē
beeing in distresse, we cannot
pray as we ought God accepts
the very groanes, sobs,
and sighes of the perplexed

heart, as the praier it selfe.
Rom. 8. 26. When we are
grieued, because we cannot
be grieued for our sinnes, it is
a degree & measure of godly
sorrow before God.Com. 4. l. 1. ad Simpli. in fine. Augustine
saith well: Sometimes
our praier is lukewarme, or rather
cold and almost no praier:
nay sometime it is altogether no
praier at all, and yet we cannot
with griefe perceiue this in our
selues: for if we can but grieue
because we cannot pray, we now
pray indeede. Hierom saith,Lib. 1. contra. Pelagianos.
                     Then we are iust when we doe
acknowledge our selues to be
sinners: Againe, this is the true
wisedome of man, to know himselfe
to be imperfect: And (that
I may so speake) the perfection
of all iust men in the flesh is imperfect:
Augustine again saith

                     That the vertue which is nowe
in a iust man is thus farre forth
perfect, that vnto the perfection
thereof, there belongs a true
acknowledgement and an humble
confession of the imperfection
thereof. A broken and contrite
heart after an offence, is
as much with God, as if there
had bin no offence at al. And
therefore so soone as Dauid
after his grieuous fall, in heauinesse
of heart confessed his
sinne, saying in effect but thus
much: I haue sinned, the Prophet
in the name of the Lord
pronounceth the pardon of
his sinne in heauen, and that
presently.
               
            
            
               V. Conclusion.
               He that hath begunne to subiect
himselfe to Christ and his
word, though as yet hee bee
ignorant in most points of
religion, yet if he haue a care
to increase in knowledge, and
to practise that which he
knoweth, he is accepted of
God as a true beleeuer.
               
                  
                  The Exposition.
                  SVndry persons by the Euangelists
are said to beleeue,
which had onely seene
the miracles of Christ, and as
yet had made no further proceedings,
but to acknowledge
Christ to be the Messias; and
to submit themselues to him
& his doctrine, which afterward
should be taught. On
this maner the woman of Samaria
belieued, and many of

the Samaritans vpon her report:
and a certaine ruler, by
reason of a miracle wrought
vpon his sonne, is said to beleeue,
and all his houshold.
Ioh. 4. 42. 52. When our Sauiour
Christ commended the
faith of the Apostles, terming
it a rocke, against which the
gates of hell should not preuaile,
it was not the plentifull
knowledge of the doctrine of
saluation: for they were ignorant
of many articles of faith,
as namely of the death, resurrection,
ascention, and kingdome
of Christ: but because
they beleeued him to be the
sonne of God, & the sauiour
of mankinde, and they had
withall resolued themselues
to cleaue vnto him, and the
blessed doctrine of saluation

which hee taught, though as
yet they were ignorant in many
points. The holy Ghost
commendeth the faith of Rahab
when shee receiued the
spies. Now this her faith was
indeed but a seed and beginning
of liuely faith: for then
shee had onely heard of the
miracles done in Egypt, and
of the deliuerance of the Israelites,
and was thereupon
smitten with feare, and had
conceiued a resolution with
her selfe, to ioyne her selfe to
the Israelites, and to worship
the true God. Now these and
the like, are tearmed beleeuers,
upon iust cause: for
though they bee ignorant as
yet, yet their ignorance shall
bee no continuing or lasting
ignorance: and they haue excellent

seedes of grace, namely
a purpose of hart to cleaue
to Christ, and a care to profit
in the doctrine of saluation,
whereof they haue some litle
knowledge.
               
            
            
               VI. Conclusion.
               The foresaid beginnings of
grace are counterfeit, vnlesse
they encrease.
               
                  The Exposition.
                  THe wickednesse of mans
nature, and the depth of
hypocrisie is such, that a man
may & can easily transforme
himselfe into the counterfeit
and resemblance of any grace
of God. Therefore I put
downe in this last conclusion

a certaine note, whereby the
gifts of God may be discerned,
namely, that they grow
vp and increase as the graine
of Musterd-seede to a great
tree, and beare fruit answerably.
The grace in the heart is
like the graine of Musterd-seede
in two things. First it is
small to see to at the beginning:
secondly, after it is cast
into the ground of the heart,
it increaseth speedily, and
spreads it selfe. Therefore, if a
man at the first haue but some
litle feeling of his wants, some
weake and faint desire, some
small obedience, he must not
let this sparke of grace goe
out, but these motions of the
spirit must be increased by
the vse of the word, Sacraments,
and praier: and they

must daily bee stirred vp by
meditating, endeauouring,
striuing, asking, seeking,
knocking. The master deliuering
his talents to his seruants,
saith vnto them: Occupie
till I come, aud not
hide in the earth, Matth. 25.
26, Paul vseth an excellent
speech to Timothie: I exhort
thee to stirre vp the gift of
God which is in thee, namely,
as fire is stirred vp by often
blowing, and putting to
of wood. 2. Tim. 1. 6. As
for such motions of the heart
that last for a weeke, or a moneth,
and after vanish away,
they are not to bee regarded:
& the Lord by the Prophet
Ose complaineth of them,
saying, O Ephraim, thy righteousnes
is like the morning

dewe, chap. 6.
                  Therefore considering,
grace vnlesse it be confirmed
and exercised, is indeede no
grace; I will heere adde certaine
rules of direction, that
wee may the more easily put
in practise the spirituall exercises
of inuocation, faith, and
repentance: and thereby also
quicken and reuiue the seeds
and beginnings of grace.
                  1. In what place soeuer
thou art, whether alone or abroad,
by day or by night,
and whatsoeuer thou art doing,
set thy selfe in the presēce
of God: let this perswasion
alwaies take place in thy hart
that thou are before the liuīg
God: and do thy endeauour,
that this perswasion may
smite thy heart with awe and

reuerence, and make thee afraid
to sin. This councell the
Lord gaue Abraham. Gen. 17.
1. Walke before me and be vpright.
This thing also was practised
by Enoch, who for this
cause is said to walke with God.
                  
                  2. Esteeme of euery present
day as of the day of thy
death: and therefore liue as
though thou were dying; and
doe those good duties euery
day, that thou wouldest doe
if thou were dying. This is
Christian watchfulnesse; and
remember it.
                  3. Make catalogues and
bills of thine owne sinnes,
specially of those sinnes that
haue most dishonoured God,
and wounded thine owne
conscience: set them before
thee oftē, specially then, whē
                     
thou hast any particular occasion
of renewing thy repentance,
that thy heart by
this dolefull sight may bee
further humbled. This was
Dauids practise when hee
considered his waies, and
turned his feet to Gods commandements,
Psal. 119. 57.
And when he confessed the
sinnes of his youth. Psal. 25,
This was Iobs practise, when
he said he was not able to answer
one of a thousand of his
sinnes vnto God. Iob. 9. 1.
                  4. When thou first openest
thine eyes in a morning,
pray to God, and giue him
thankes heartily: God then
shall haue his honour, and
thy heart shall be the better
for it the whole day following.

For we see in experience,
that vessels keepe long the
taste of that liquor wherwith
they are first seasoned. And
when thou liest downe, let
that be the last also: for thou
knowest not, whether fallen
a sleepe, thou shalt euer rise
againe aliue. Good therefore
it is, that thou shouldest giue
vp thy selfe into the hands of
God, whilst thou art waking.
                  5. Labour to see and feele
thy spirituall pouerty, that is,
to see the want of grace in thy
selfe, specially those inward
corruptions, of vnbeliefe,
pride, selfe-loue, &c. Labour
to be displeased with thy self:
and labour to feele, that by
reason of them, thou standest
in neede of euery drop of the
blood of Christ to heale and

clense thee from those wants:
and let this practise take such
place with thee, that if thou
be demaunded, what in thine
estimation is the vilest of the
creatures vpon earth? thine
heart and conscience may
answer with a loud voice, I,
euen I, by reason of mine owne
sinnes: and againe, if thou be
demaunded, what is the best
thing in the world for thee?
thy heart and conscience may
answer againe with a strong
and loud crie, One drop of the
blood of Christ to wash away my
sinnes.
                  
                  6. Shew thy selfe to bee a
member of Christ, and a seruant
of God, not only in the
generall calling of a Christian,
but also in the particular
calling in which thou art placed.

It is nothing for a magistrate
to be a Christiā man,
but he must also be a Christian
magistrate: it is not inough
for a master of a family to be
a Christiā man, or a Christiā
in the Church, but the must also
be a Christiā in the family
& in the trade which he followeth
daily. Not euery one
that is a common hearer of
the word, and a frequenter of
the Lords table, is therefore
a good Christian, vnlesse his
conuersation in his priuate
house, and in his priuate affaires,
& dealings be sutable:
There, is a man to be seene
what he is.
                  7. Search the scriptures,
to see what is sinne, and what
is not sinne in euery action:
this done, carry in thy heart a

constant and resolute purpose,
not to sin in any thing:
for faith and the purpose of
sinning can neuer stand together.
                  8. Let thine endeauour be
sutable to thy purpose: and
therefore doe nothing at any
time against thy conscience,
ritely enformed by the word:
exercise thy selfe to eschew
euery sinne, and to obey God
in euery one of his commandements,
that pertaine either
to the generall calling of a
Christian, or thy particular
calling. Thus did good Iosias,
who turned vnto God with
all his heart, according to all
the lawe of Moses. 1. King.
25. 25. and thus did Zacharie
and Elizabeth, that walked in
all the commandements of

God without reproofe, Luk. 1. 6.
                  9. If at any time against
thy purpose and resolution,
thou bee ouertaken with any
sinne little or great, lie not in
it, but speedily recouer thy
selfe by repentance: humble
thy selfe, confessing thine offence,
and by praier intreat
the Lord to pardon the same,
and that earnestly, till such
time as thou findest thy conscience
truly pacified, and thy
care to eschew the same sinne
increased.
                  10. Consider often of the
right and proper ende of thy
life in this world, which is not
to seeke profit, honour, pleasure,
but that in seruing of
men, wee might serue God in
our callings. God could, if it

so pleased him, preserue man
without the ministry of man,
but his pleasure is to fulfil his
worke and will in the preseruation
of our bodies, and saluation
of our soules, by the
imploiment of men in his seruice,
euery one according to
his vocation. Neither is there
so much as a bond slaue, but
he must in and by his faithful
seruice to his master, serue the
Lord. Men therefore doe
commonly profane their labours
and liues, by aiming at
a wrong ende, when all their
care consisteth onely in getting
sufficient maintenance
for them and theirs, for the
obtaining of credit, riches, &
carnall cōmodities. For thus
men serue themselves, & not
God, or men: much lesse doe

they serue God in seruing of
men.
                  11. Giue all diligence to
make thy election sure, and
to gather manifold tokens
thereof. For this cause obserue
the worke of Gods
prouidence, loue, and mercy,
both in thee and vpon thee,
from time to time: for the serious
consideration of them,
and the laying of them together
when they are many and
seuerall, minister much direction,
assurance of Gods fauour,
and comfort. This was
the practise of Dauid, 1. Sam.
17 14. Psal. 23. all.
                  12. Thinke euermore thy
present estate whatsoeuer it
bee, to bee the best estate for
thee: because whatsoeuer befalls
thee, though it bee sicknes,

or any other affliction, or
death, befals thee of the good
prouidence of God. That
this may the better bee done,
labour to see and acknowledge
a prouidence of God,
as wel in pouertie as in abundance,
as well in disgrace as
good report, as well in sickenes,
as in health, as well in life
as in death.
                  13. Pray continually, I
meane not by solemne & set
praier, but by secret and inward
eiaculatiōs of the heart,
that is, by a continuall eleuation
of minde vnto Christ,
sitting at the right hand of
God the Father, and that either
by prayer or giuing of
thankes so often as any occaon
shall be offered.
                  14. Thinke often of the

worst and most grieuous
things that may befall thee,
either in this life or death for
the name of Christ: make a
reckoning of them, and prepare
thy selfe to beare them:
that when they come, they
may not seeme strange, but
be borne the more easily.
                  15. Make conscience of
idle, vaine, vnhonest and vngodly
thoughts: for these are
the seedes and beginnings of
actuall sin in word & in deed.
This want of care in ordering
and composing of our
thoughts, is often punished
with a fearefull temptation in
the very thought, called of
Diuines, Tentatio blasphemiarum,
a tentation of blasphemies.
                  16. When any good motion

or affection riseth in the
heart, suffer it not passe away,
but feede it by reading, meditating.
praying.
                  17. Whatsoeuer good
thing thou goest about, whether
it be in word or deed, do
it not in a conceit of thy selfe,
or in the pride of thy heart,
but in humility, ascribing the
power whereby thou doest
thy worke, and the praise
thereof to God, otherwise
thou shalt finde by experience,
God will curse thy best
doings.
                  18. Despise not ciuill honestie:
good conscience and
good maners must goe togither:
therefore remember
to make conscience of lying,
and of customable swearing
in common talke: contend

not either in deede or
word with any man, be curteous
and gentle to all, good
and badde: beare with mens
wants and frailties, as hastinesse,
frowardnesse, selfeliking,
curiousnesse, &c. passing
by them as being not perceiued:
returne not euill for
euill, but rather good for euill:
vse meate, drinke, and apparell
in that manner and
measure, that they may further
godlinesse; and may be
as it were signes in which
thou maiest expresse the hidden
grace of thy heart: Striue
not to goe beyond any, vnlesse
it be in good things: goe
before thine equals in giuing
of honour, rather then in taking
of it: make conscience of
thy word, and let it bee as a

bond: professe no more outwardly
thē thou hast inwardly
in heart: opresse or defraud
no man in bargaining: in all
companies either doe good,
or take good.
                  19. Cleaue not by inordinate
affection to any creature,
but aboue all things quiet
& rest thy mind in Christ,
aboue all dignitie and honour,
aboue all cunning and
policie, aboue all glorie and
honour, aboue all health and
beautie, aboue all wealth and
treasure, aboue all ioy and delight,
aboue al fame & praise,
aboue all mirth and consolation,
that mans heart can
feele or deuise beside Christ.
                  With these rules of practise,
ioyne rules of meditation;
whereof I propound sixe

vnto thee, as I finde them set
downe by a learned Diuine,
called Victorius Strigelius.
                  
                  
                     I.
                     Wee must not fall away
from God for any creature.
                  
                  
                     II.
                     Infinite eternitie is farre to
be preferred before the short
race of this mortall life.
                  
                  
                     III.
                     We must hold fast the promise
of grace, though wee
loose all temporall blessings
and they also in death must
needes be left.
                  
                  
                     IV.
                     Let the loue of God in
Christ, and the loue of the
Church for Christ, be strong
in thee, and preuaile against
all other affections.
                  
                  
                     
                     V.
                     It is the principall arte of a
Christian, to beleeue things
inuisible, to hope for things
deferred, to loue God when
hee shewes him to be an enemie,
and thus to perseuere
vnto the ende.
                  
                  
                     VI.
                     It is a most effectual remedy
for any griefe, to quiet our
selues in a confidence of the
presence and helpe of God:
and to aske of him, and withall
to waite either for some
easement or deliuerance.
                  
                  
                     VII.
                     All the works of God are
done in contrarie meanes.
