            Reader,
            
               IT is as ordinarie a custome (for vs that are Bookish) to haue about with thee, after wee haue done with a Patron, as for Schollers (in the noble Science) to play at the woodden Rapier and Dagger at the ende of a Maisters prize. In doing which we know not vpon what Speeding points wee runne, for you (that are Readers) are the most despe

You are able (if you haue the tokens of deadly Ignorance, and Boldnes at one time vpon you) to breede more infection on in Pauls Church-yard, then all the bodies that were buried there in the Plague-time, if they had beene left still aboue ground. You stand somtimes at a Stationers stal, looking scuruily (like Mules champing vpon Thistles) on the face of a new Booke bee it neuer so worthy: & goe (as il fauouredly) mewing away: But what get you by it? The Booke-seller euer after when you passe by, pinnes on your backes the badge of fooles to make you be laught to scorne, or of sillie Carpers to make you be pitted: Comadus Gesner neuer writ of the nature of such strange beasts as you are: for where as we call you Lectores, Readers, you turne your selues into Lictores, Executioners, & tormenters. I wold not haue him that writes better than I, to Reade this, nor

            The Induction to the Booke.
            
               I Finde it written in that Booke where no vntruthes can be read: in that Booke whose leaues shall out-last sheetes of brasse, and whose lynes leade to eternity: yea euen in that Booke that was pend by the best Author of the best wisedome, allowed by a Deity, licensed by the Omnipotent, and published (in all Languages to all Nations) by the greatest, truest, and onely Diuine, thus I find it written, that for Sinne, Angels were throwne out of heauen; for Sinne, the first man that euer was made, was made an outcast: he was driuen ouf of his liuing that was left vnto him by his Creator: It was a goodlier liuing, than the Inheritance of Princes: he lost Paradice by it (he lost his house of pleasure:) hee lost Eden by it, a Garden, where Winter could neuer haue nipt him with cold, nor Summer haue scorcht him with heate. He had there all fruits growing to delight his taste, all flowers flourishing to allure his eye, all Birds singing to content his eare; he had more

than he could desire: yet because he desired more than was fit for him, he lost all. For Sinne, all those buildings which that great Worke-master of the world had in sixe dayes raysed, were swallowed at the first by waters, and shall at last be consumed in fire. How many families hath this Leuiathan deuoured? how many Cities? how many Kingdoms? Let vs a while leaue Kingdomes, and enter into Citties. Sodom and Gomorrah were burnt to the ground with brinstone that dropt in flakes from heauen: a hot and dreadfull vengeance. Ierusalem hath not a stone left vpon another of her first glorious foundation: a heauy and fearefull downefall. Ierusalem, that was Gods owne dwelling house; the Schoole where those Hebrew Lectures, which he himselfe read, were taught; the very Nursery where the Prince of Heauen was brought vp; that Ierusalem, whose Rulers were Princes, & whose Citizens were like the sonnes of Kings: whose Temples were paued with gold, and whose houses stood like rowes of tall Cedars; that Ierusalem is now a dezert; It is vnhallowed, and vnt

                odden: no Monument is left to shew it was a Citty, but only the memoriall of the Iewes hard-hartednes, in making away their Sauiour: It is now a place for barbarous Turks, and poore despised Grecians; it is rather now (for the abominations committed in it) no place at all.
            Let vs hoyst vp more Sayles, and lanch into other Seas, till wee come in ken of our owne Countrey. Antwerp (the eldest daughter of Brabant) hath falne in her pride, the Citties of rich Burgundy in theyr greatnes. Those seuenteene Dutch Virgins of Belgia, (that had Kingdomes to theyr

dowries, and were worthy to be courted by Nations) are now no more Virgins: the Souldier hath deflowred them, and robd them of theyr Mayden honor: Warre hath still vse of their noble bodyes, and discouereth theyr nakednes like prostituted Strumpets. Famine hath dryed vp the fresh bloud in theyr cheekes, whilst the Pestilence digd vp theyr Fields, and turned them into Graues. Neither haue these punishments bin layd vpon them onely; for bloud hath bin also drawne of their very next neighbours. France lyes yet panting vnder the blowes which her owne Children haue giuen her. Thirty yeeres together suffred she her bowels to be torne out by those that were bred within them: She was full of Princes, and saw them all lye mangled at her feete: She was full of people, and saw in one night a hundred thousand massacred in her streetes: her Kings were eaten vp by Ciuill warres, and her Subiects by fire and famine. O gallant Monarchy, what hard fate hadst thou, that when none were left to conquer thee, thou shouldst triumph ouer thy selfe! Thou hast Wynes flowing in thy veynes: but thou madest thy selfe druncke with thine owne bloud. The English, the Dutch, and the Spanish, stoode aloofe and gaue ayme, whilst thou shotst arrowes vpright, that fell vpon thine owne head, and wounded thee to death. Wouldst thou (and the rest) know the reason, why your bones haue bin bruzed with rods of Iron? It was, because you haue risen in Arch-rebellion against the Supremest Soueraigne: You haue bin Traytors to your Lord, the King of heauen and earth, and haue armed your selues to fight against the

Holy Land. Can the father of the world measure out his loue so vnequally, that one people (like to a mans yongest child) should be more made of than all the rest, being more vnruly than the rest? O London, thou art great in glory, and enuied for thy greatnes: thy Towers, thy Temples, and thy Pinnacles stand vpon thy head like borders of fine gold, thy waters like frindges of siluer hang at the hemmes of thy garments. Thou art the goodliest of thy neighbors, but the prowdest; the welthiest, but the most wanton. Thou hast all things in thee to make thee fairest, and all things in thee to make thee foulest: for thou art attir'de like a Bride, drawing all that looke vpon thee, to be in loue with thee, but there is much harlot in thine eyes. Thou sitst in thy Gates heated with Wines, and in thy Chambers with lust. What miseries haue of late ouertaken thee? yet (like a foole that laughs when hee is putting on fetters) thou hast bin merry in height of thy misfortunes.

                She (that for almost halfe a hundred of yeeres) of thy Nurse became thy Mother, and layd thee in her bosome, whose head was full of cares for thee, whilst thine slept vpon softer pillowes than downe. She that wore thee alwayes on her brest as the richest Iewell in her kingdome, who had continually her eye vpon thee, and her heart with thee: whose chaste hand clothed thy Rulers in Scarlet, and thy Inhabitants in roabes of peace: euen she was taken from thee, when thou wert most in feare to lose her: when thou didst tremble (as at an earth-quake) to thinke that bloud should runne in thy Channels, that the Canon should make away through thy Portcullises, and fire rifle thy wealthy houses, then, euen then wert thou

left full of teares,
                  King Iames his Coronation.
                and becamst an Orphan. But behold, thou hadst not sat many howres on the banks of sorrow, but thou hadst a louing Father that adopted thee to be his owne: thy mourning turnd presently to gladnes, thy terrors into triumphs. Yet, lest this fulnesse of ioy should beget in thee a wantonnes, and to try how wisely thou couldst take vp affliction, Sicknes was sent to breathe her vnholsome ayres into thy nosthrils, so that thou, that wert before the only Gallant and Minion of the world, hadst in a short time more diseases (then a common Harlot hath) hanging vpon thee; thou suddenly becamst the by-talke of neighbors, the scorne and contempt of Nations.
            Heere could I make thee weepe thy selfe away into waters, by calling back those sad and dismall houres, wherein thou consumedst almost to nothing with shrikes and lamentations, in that 
                  A Booke so called, written by the Author, describing the horror of the Plague in 1602, when there dyed 30578. of that disease.
                
               Wonderfull yeere, when these miserable calamities entred in at thy Gates, slaying 30000. and more as thou heldst them in thine armes, but they are fresh in thy memory, and the story of them (but halfe read ouer) would strike so coldly to thy heart, and lay such heauy sorrow vpon mine (Namque animus meminisse horret, luctuque refugit) that I will not be thine and my owne tormentor with the memory of them. How quickly notwithstanding didst thou forget that beating? The wrath of him that smot thee, was no sooner (in meere pitty of thy stripes) appeased, but howrely (againe) thou wert in the company of euill doers, euen before thou couldst finde leysure to aske him forgiuenes.
            Euer since that time hath hee winckt at thy errors, and suffred thee (though now thou art growne

old, and lookest very ancient) to goe on still in the follyes of thy youth: he hath ten-fold restor'de thy lost sonnes and daughters, and such sweete, liuely, fresh colours hath hee put vpon thy cheekes, that Kings haue come to behold thee,
                  King of England, and Christierne King of Denmarke.
                and Princes to delight their eyes with thy bewty. None of all these fauours (for all this) can draw thee from thy wickednes: Graces haue powrd downe out of heauen vpon thee, and thou art rich in all things, sauing in goodnes: So that now once againe hath he gone about (and but gone about) to call thee to the dreadfull Barre of his Iudgement. And no maruaile: for whereas other Citties (as glorious as thy selfe,) and other people (as deare vnto him as thine) haue in his indignation bin quite taken from the face of the earth, for some one peculiar Sinne, what hope hast thou to grow vp still in the pride of thy strength, gallantnes and health, hauing seuen deadly and detestable sinnes lying night by night by thy lasciuious sides? O thou beawtifullest daughter of two vnited Monarchies! from thy womb receiued I my being, frō thy brests my nourishment; yet giue me leaue to tell thee, that thou hast seuen Diuels within thee, and till they be cleane cast out, the Arrowes of Pestilence will fall vpon thee by day, and the hand of the Inuader strike thee by night. The Sunne will shine, but not be a comfort to thee, and the Moone looke pale with anger, whē she giues thee light. Thy Louers will disdayne to court thee: thy Temples will no more send out Diuine oracles: Iustice will take her flight, and dwell else-where; and that Desolation, which now for three yeeres together hath houered round about thee, will at last enter, and turne thy Gardens

of pleasure, into Church-yards; thy Fields that seru'd thee for walks, into Golgotha; and thy hye built houses, into heapes of dead mens Sculs. I call him to witnes, who is all Truth, I call the Cittizens of heauen to witnes, who are all spotlesse, that I slander thee not, in saying thou nourishest seuen Serpents at thy brests, that will destroy thee: let all thy Magistrates and thy officers speake for me: let Strangers that haue but seene thy behauiour, be my Iudges: let all that are gathered vnder thy wings, and those that sleepe in thy bosome, giue their verdict vpon me; yea, try me (as thy brabblings are) by all thy Petit and Graund Iurors, and if I belye thee, let my Country (when I expire) deny me her common blessing, Buriall, Lift vp therefore thy head (thou Mother of so many people:) awaken out of thy dead and dangerous slumbers, and with a full and fearelesse eye behold those seuen Monsters, that with extended iawes gape to swallow vp thy memory: for I will into so large a field single euery one of them, that thou and all the world shall see their vglinesse, for by seeing them, thou mayst auoyd them, and by auoyding them, be the happiest and most renowned of Citties.
         
      
      
         
            
               
               
               Politick Bankruptisme, Or, The first dayes Triumph of the first Sinne.
               
                  IT is a custome in all Countries, when great personages are to be entertained, to haue great preparation made for them: and because London disdaines to come short of any City, either in Magnificence, State, or expences vpon such an occasion, solemne order was set downe, and seuen seuerall solemne dayes were appointed to receiue these seuen Potentates: for they carry the names of Princes on the earth, and wheresoe're they inhabit, in a short time are they Lords of great Dominions.
               The first dayes Triumphs were spent in méeting and conducting Politick Bankruptisme into the Fréedome: to receiue whom, the Master, the Kéepers,
                     The maner how Bank

                   and all the Prisoners of Ludgate in their best clothes stood most officiously readie: for at that Gate, his Deadlinesse challenges a kind of prerogatiue by the Custome of the Citie, and there loues he most to be let in. The thing they stood vpon, was a Scaffold erected for the purpose, stuck round about with a few gréene boughes (like an Alehouse booth at a Fayre) and couered with two or thrée

thréed-bare Carpets (for prisoners haue no better) to hide the vnhandsomnes of the Carpenters worke: the boughes with the very strong breath that was prest out of the vulgar, withered, & like Autumnian leaues dropt to the ground, which made the Broken Gentleman to hasten his progresse the more, and the rather, because Lud and his two sonnes stood in a very cold place, waiting for his comming. Being vnder the gate, there stood one arm'd with an extemporall speech, to giue him the onset of his welcome: It was not (I would you should well know) the Clarke of a country parish, or the Schoolemaster of a corporate towne, ye euery yéere has a saying to Master Maior, but it was a bird pickt out of purpose (amongst the Ludgathians) that had the basest and lowdest voice, and was able in a Terme time, for a throat, to giue any prisoner great ods for ye bor at the grate: this Organpipe was

At which, all the prisoners rending the ayre with shouts, the key was turnd, & vp (in state) was he led into king Luds house of Bondage, to suruey the building, and to take possession of ye lodgings; where he no sooner

                     •
                  ookes could fasten him to them: he was (like their clocks) to strike in more places than one, & though he knew many Citizens hated him, and that if he were encountred by some of them, it might cost him déere, yet vnder so good a protection did he go (as he said) because he owed no ill will euen to those that most sought his vndoing; and therefore tooke his leaue of the house, with promise, to be with them, or send to thē once euery quarter at the least. So that now, by his wise instructions,
                     Misery makes men cunning.
                   if a Puny were there amongst them, he might learne more cases, and more quiddits in law within seuen dayes, that he does at his Inne in fourtéene moneths.
               The Politician béeing thus got into the City, caries himself to discreetly, that he steales into the hearts of many:
                     His qualities.
                   In words, is he circumspect: in lookes, graue: in attire, ciuill: in diet, temperate:

in company affable; in his affaires serious: and so cunningly dooes he lay on these colours, that in the end he is welcome to, and familiar with the best. So that now, there is not any one of all the twelue Companies, in which (at one time or other) there are not those that haue forsaken their owne Hall, to be frée of his: yea some of your best Shop-kéepers hath he entited to shut themselues vp from the cares and busines of the world, to liue a priuate life; nay, there is not any great and famous Streete in the City, wherein there hath not (or now doth not) dwell, some one, or other, that hold the points of his Religion.
                     His disguises.
                   For you must vnderstand, that the Politick Bankrupt is a Harpy that lookes smoothly, a Hyena that enchants subtilly, a Mermaid that sings swéetly, and a Cameleon, that can put himselfe into all colours. Sometimes hée's a Puritane, he sweares by nothing but Indéede, or rather does not sweare at al
                     •
                  , and wrapping his crafty Serpents body in the cloake of Religion, he does those acts that would become none but a Diuell. Sometimes hee's a Protestant, and deales iustly with all men, till he sée his time, but in the end he turnes Turke. Because you shall beléeue me, I will giue you his length by the Scale, and Anatomize his body from head to foote. Héere it is.
               
                  
                     His policy.
                  Whether he be a Tradesman, or a Marchant, when he first sets himselfe vp, and séekes to get the world into his hands, (yet not to go out of ye City) or first talks of Countries he neuer saw (vpon the Change) he will be sure to kéepe his dayes of payments more truly, then Lawyers kéepe their Termes, or than Executors kéepe the last lawes

that the dead inioyned them to, which euen Infidels themselues will not violate: his hand goes to his head, to his meanest customer, (to expresse his humilitie;) he is vp earlier then a Sarieant, and downe later then a Constable, to proclaime his thrift. By such artificiall whéeles as these, he winds himselfe vp into the height of rich mens fauors, till he grow rich himselfe, and when he sées that they dare build vpon his credit, knowing the ground to be good, he takes vpon him the condition of an Asse, to any man that will loade him with gold; and vseth his credit like a Ship freighted with all sorts of Merchandize by ventrous Pilots: for after he hath gotten into his hands so much of other mens goods or money, as will fill him to the vpper deck, away he sayles with it, and politickly runnes himselfe on ground, to make the world beléeue he had sufferd shipwrack. Then flyes he out like an Irish rebell, and kéepes aloofe, hiding his head, when he cannot hide his shame: and though he haue fethers on his back puld frō sundry birds, yet to himselfe is he more wretched, then ye Cuckoo in winter, that dares not be séene. The troupes of honest Citizens (his creditors) with whom he hath broken league and hath thus defyed, muster themselues together, and proclaime open warre: their bands consist of tall Yeomen, that serue on foot, cō

               But this is not all neither: for thou lyest on thy bed of death, and art not carde for: thou goest out of the world, and art not lamented: thou art put into the last linnen y• euer thou shalt weare, (thy winding-shéete) with reproch, and art sent into thy Graue with curses: he that makes thy

Doth not ye thought of this torment thée? She liues basely by the abuse of that body, to maintaine which in costly garments, thou didst wrong to thine owne soule: nay more to afflict thée, thy children are ready to beg their bread in that very place, where the father hath sat at his dore in purple, and at his boord like Diues, surfeting on those dishes which were earnd by the sweat of other mens browes. The infortunate Marchant,

whose estate is swallowed vp by the mercilesse Seas, and the prouident Trades-man, whom riotous Seruants at home, or hard-hearted debters abroad vndermine and euerthrow, blotting them with the name of Bankrupts, deserue to be pitied and relieued, when thou that hast cozend euen thine owne Brother of his Birth-right, art laught at, and not remembred, but in scorne, when thou art plagued in thy Generation.
               
               Be wise therefore, you Graue, and wealthy Cittizens; play with these Whales of the Sea, till you escape them that are deuourers of your Merchants; hunt these English Wolues to death, and rid the land of them: for these are the Rats that eate vp the prouision of the people: these are the Grashoppers of Egypt, that spoyle the Corne-fields of the Husband-man and the rich mans Uineyards: they will haue poore Naboths piece of ground from him, though they eate a piece of his heart for it. These are indéede (and none but these) the Forreners that liue without the fréedome of your City, better than you within it; they liue without the freedome of honestly, of conscience, and of christianitie. Ten dicing-houses cheate not yong Gentlemen of so much mony in a years, as these do you in a moneth. The théefe that dyes at Tyburne for a robbery, is not halfe so dangerous a wéede in a Common-wealth, as the Politick Bankrupt, I would there were a Derick to hang vp him too.
               The Russians haue an excellent custome: they beate them on the shinnes, that haue mony, and will not pay their debts; if that law were w

                  I would faine sée a prize set vp, that the welfed Usurer, and the politick Bankrupt might rayle one against another for it: ô, it would heget a riming Comedy. The Challenge of the Germayne against all the Masters of the Noble Science, would not bring in a quarter of the money: for there is not halfe so much loue betweene the Iron and the Loadestone, as there is mortall hate betwéene those two Furies. The Usurer liues by the lechery of mony, and is Bawd to his owne bags, taking a fée, that they may ingender. The Politick Bankrupt liues by the gelding of bags of Siluer. The Usurer puts out a hundred poūd to bréede, and lets it run in a good pasture (thats to say, in the lands that are mortgag'd for it) till it grow great with Foale, and bring forth ten pound more. But the Politick Bankrupt playes the Alchimist, and hauing taken a hundred pound to multiply it, he kéepes a puffing and a blowing, as if he would fetch the Philosophers stone out of it, yet melts your hundred pound so l

His triumphs haue bin great, his entertainement rich and magnificent. He purposes to lye héere as Lucifers Legiar: let him therefore alone in his lodging (in what part of the Citty soeuer it be) tossed and turmoyled with godlesse slumbers, and let vs take vp a standing néere some other Gate, to behold the Entrance of the Second Sinne: but before you go, looke vpō the Chariot that this First is drawne in,

On the right side runs Beggery, who if he out-liue him, goes to serue his children. Hipocrisy driues the Chariot, hauing a couple of fat well-coloured and lusty Coach-horses to the eye, cald Couetousnes and Cosenage, but full of diseases, & rotten about the heart. Behind him follow a crowd of Trades-men, and Merchants, euery one of them holding either a Shop-booke, or an Obligation in his hand, their seruants, wiues and children strawing the way before him with curses, but he carelesly runnes ouer the one, and out-rides the other; at the tayle of whom (like the Pioners of an Army) march troopewise, and without any Drum struck vp, because the Leader can abide no noyse, a company of old expert Sarieants, bold Yeomen, hungry Baylifs, and other braue Martiall men, who because (like the Switzers) they are well payd, are still in Action, and oftentimes haue the enemy in execution; following the héeles of this Citty-Conqueror, so close, not for any loue they owe him, but only (as all those that follow great men do) to get mony by him. We will leaue them lying in Ambush, or holding their Courts of Gard, and take a muster of our next Regiment.

To knocke, hee thought it no policy, because such fellowes are commonly most churlish, when they are most intreated, and are key-cold in their comming downe to Strangers, except they be brybed: to stay there with such

                   confusion of faces round about him, till light should betray him, might call his Arriuall, being strange and hidden, into question; besides, he durst not send any Spy he had, to listen what newes went amongst the people, and whether any preparation were made for him, or that they did expect his approche, because indéede there was not any one of the Damned Crewe that followed his tayle, whom he durst trust for a true word. He resolues therefore to make his entrance, not by the sword, but by some sleyght, what storme or fayre weather soeuer should happen: And for that purpose, taking asunder his Charriot, (for it stood altogether like a Germane clock,

or an English, Iack or Turne-spit, vpon skrewes and vices) he scatters his Troope vpon the fields and hye-way, into small companies, as if they had bene Irish beggers; till at last espying certayne Colliers with Carts most sinfully loaden, for the Citty, and behind them certayne light Country Horse-women ryding to the Markets, hée mingled his Footemen carelesly, amongst these, and by this Stratagem of Coales, brauely thorow Moore-gate, got within the walles; where marching not like a plodding Grasyer with his Droues before him, but like a Citty-Captayne, with a Company (as pert as Taylours at a wedding) close at his héeles, because nowe they knewe they were out of feare) hée musters together all the Hackneymen and Horse-courses in and about Colman-streete.
               
               No sooner had these Sonnes and Heyres vnto Horse-shooes, got him into their eyes, but they wept for ioy to behold him; yet in the ende, putting vp their teares into bottles of Hay, which they held vnder their armes, and wyping their slubberd chéekes with wispes of cleane Strawe, (prouyded for the nonce) they harnessed the Grand Signiors Caroach, mounted his Cauallery vpon Curtals, and so sent him most pompously (like a new elected Dutch Burgomaster) into the Citty.
               He was lookt vpon strangely by all whom he met, for at the first, few or none knew him, few followed him, few bid him welcome: But after hée had spent héere a very little péece of time, after it

was voyc'd that Monsieur Mendax came to dwell amongst them, and had brought with him all sorts of politick falshood and lying, what a number of Men, Women and Children fell presently in loue with him! There was of euery Trade in the City, and of euery profession some, that instantly were dealers with him: For you must note, that in a State so multitudinous, where so many flocks of people must be fed, it is impossible to haue some Trades to stand, if they should not Lye.
               
               How quickly after the Art of Lying was once publiquely profest, were false Weights and false Measures inuented! and they haue since done as much hurt to the inhabitants of Cities, as the inuention of Gunnes hath done to their walles: for though a Lye haue but short legs (like a Dwarfes) yet it goes farre in a little time, Et crescit eundo, and at last prooues a tall fellow: the reason is, that Truth had euer but one Father, but Lyes are a thousand mens Bastards, and are begotten euery where.
               Looke vp then (Thou thy Countryes Darling,) and behold what a diuelish Inmate thou hast intertained. The Genealogy of Truth is well knowne, for she was borne in Heauen, and dwels in Heauen: Falshood then and Lying must of necessity come out of that hot Country of Hell, from the line of Diuels: for those two are as opposite, as day and darkenes. What an vngracious Generation wilt thou mingle with thine, if thou draw not this from thée: What a number of vnhappy and cursed childrē will be left vpō thy hand? for Lying is Father to Falshood, and Grandsire to Periury: Frawd (with two faces) is his Daughter, a very

Monster: Treason (with haires like Snakes) is his kinseman; a very Fury! how art thou inclos'd with danger? The Lye first deceiues thée, and to shoote the deceit off cleanly, an oath (like an Arrow) is drawne to the head, and that hits the marke. If a Lye, after it is molded, be not smooth enough, there is no instrumēt to burnish it, but an oath: Swearing giues it cullor, & a bright complexion. So that Oathes are Crutches, vpon which Lyes (like lame soldiers) go, & néede no other pasport. Little oathes are able to beare vp great lyes: but great Lyes are able to beate downe great Families: For oathes are wounds that a man stabs into himselfe, yea, they are burning words that consume those who kindle them.
               What fooles then are thy Buyers and Sellers to be abused by such hell-hounds? Swearing and Forswearing put into their hands perhaps the gaines of a little Siluer, but like those pieces which Iudas receiued, they are their destruction. Welth so gotten, is like a trée set in the depth of winter, it prospers not.
               But is it possible (Thou leader of so great a Kingdome) that heretofore so many bonfires of mens bodies should be made before thée in the good quarrell of Trueth? and that now thou shouldst take part wish her enemy? Haue so many Triple-pointed darts of Treason bin shot at the heads of thy Princes, because they would not take Truth out of thy Temples, and art thou now in League with false Witches ye would kill thée? Thou art no Traueler, the habit of Lying therefore will not become thée, cast it off.
               He that giues a soldier the Lye, lookes to receiue the stab: but what danger does he run vpon, that giues a whole City the Lye? yet must I venture to giue it thée. Let me tell thée then, that Thou doest Lye with Pride, and though thou art not so gawdy, yet are thou more costly in attiring thy selfe than the Court, because

                  Pride is the Queene of Sinnes, thou hast chosen her to be thy Concubine, and hast begotten many base Sonnes and Daughters vpon her body, as Vainglory, Curiosity, Disobedience, Opinion, Disdaine, &c. Pride, by thy Lying with her, is growne impudent: She is now a common Harlot, and euery one hath vse of her body. The Taylor calls her his Lemman, he hath often got her great with child of Phantasticallity and Fashions, who no sooner came into the world, but the fairest Wiues of thy Tennants snatcht them vp into their armes, layd them in their laps and to their brests, and after they had plaid with them their pleasure, into the country were those two children (of the Taylors) sent to be nurst vp, so that they liue sometimes there, but euer and anon with thée.
               Thou doest likewise Lye with Vsury: how often hast thou bin found in bed with her! How often hath she bin openly disgraced at the Crosse for a Strumpet! yet still doest thou kéepe her company, and art not ashamed of it, because you commit Sinne together, euen in those houses that haue paynted posts standing at the Gates. What vngodly brats and kindred hath she brought thée? for vpon Vsury hast thou begotten Extortion, (a strong, but an vnmannerly child,) Hardnes of heart, a very murderer, and Bad Conscience, who is so vnruly, that he séemes to be sent vnto thée, to be thy euerlasting paine. Then hath she Sonnes in law, and they are all Scriueners: those Scriueners haue base sonnes, and they are all common Brokers; those Brokers likewise send a number into the world, & they are all Common Theeues.
               
               All of these may easily giue Armes: for they fetch their discent from hell, where are as many Gentlemen, as in any one place, in any kingdome.
               
                  Thou doost lye with sundrie others, and committest strange whoredomes, which by vse and boldnesse growe so common, that they seeme to be no whoredomes at all, Yet thine owne abhominations would not appeare so vilely, but that thou makest thy buildings a Brothelry to others: for thou sufferest Religion to lye with Hipocrisie: Charity to lye with Ostentation: Friendship to lye with Hollow-heartednes: the Churle to lye with Simony: Iustice to lye with Bribery, and last of all, Conscience to lye with euerie one. So that now shee is full of diseases: But thou knowest the medicine for al these Feauers that shake thée: be therfore to thy selfe thine owne Phisitian, and by strong Pilles purge away this second infection that is breeding vpon thee, before it strike to the heart.
               
                  Falshood and Lying thus haue had their day, and like Almanackes of the last yeare, are now gon out: let vs follow them a step or two farther to see how they ride, and then (if we can) leaue them, for I perceiue it growes late, because Candle-light (who is next to enter vpō the stage) is making himself ready to act his Comicall Scenes. The Chariot then that Lying is drawne in, is made al of whetstones; Wantonnes and euil custome are his Horses: a Foole is the Coachman that driues them: a couple of swearing Fencers sometimes leade the Horses by the reynes, and sometimes flourish before them to make roome.

Nay more, hee intices their verie Prentices to make their desperate sallyes out, & quicke retyres in (contrarie to the Oath of their Indentures) which are seauen yeares a swearing, onely for their Pintes, and away.
               Tush, this is nothing: yong shopkeepers that haue but newly ventured vpon the pikes of marriage, who are euery houre shewing their wares to their Customers, plying their businesse harder all day then Vulcan does his Anuile, and seeme better husbands than Fidlers that scrape for a poore liuing both day and night, yet euen these if they can but get Candle-light, to sit vp all night with them in any house of Reckning (thats to say in a Tauerne) they fall roundly to play the London prize, and thats at three seuerall weapons, Drinking, Dauncing, & Dicing, Their wiues lying all that time in their beds sighing like widowes, which is lamentable: the giddie-braind husbāds wasting the portions they had with them, which lost once, they are (like Maiden-heades) neuer recouerable. Or which is worse, this going a Bat-fowling a nights, beeing noted by some wise yong-man or other, that knowes how to handle such cases, the hush is beaten for them at home,

whilest they catch the bird abraode, but what bird is it? the Woodcocke.
               Neuer did any Cittie pocket vp such wrong at the hands of one, ouer whom she is so iealous, and so tender, that in Winter nights if he be but missing, and hide himselfe in the darke, I know not how many Beadles are sent vp and downe the streetes to crie him: yet you see, there is more cause she should send out to curse him For what Uillanies are not abroad so long as Candle-light is stirring? The Seruing-man dare then walke with his wench: the Priuate Puncke (otherwise called one that boords in London) who like a Pigeon sits billing all day within doores, and feares to steppe ouer the thresholde, does then walke the round till midnight, after she hath beene swaggering amongst pottle pots and Uintners boyes. Nay, the sober Perpetuana suited Puritane, that dares not (so much as by Moone-light) come neere the Suburb-shadow of a house, where they set stewed Prunes befor you, raps as boldly at the hatch, when he knowes Candle-light is within, as if he were a new chosen Constable. When al doores are lockt vp, when no eyes are open, when birds sit silent in bushes, and beasts lie sleeping vnder hedges, when no creature can be smelt to be vp but they that may be smelt euery night a streets length ere you come at them, euen then doth this Ignis fatuus (Candle-light) walke like a Fire-drake into sundrie corners. If you will not beleeue this, shoote but your eye through the Iron grates into the Cellers of Uintners, there you shall see him hold his necke in a Iin, made of a clift hoope-sticke, to throttle him from telling tales, whilest they most abhominably iumble together all the papisticall drinkes that are brought from beyond-sea: the poore wines are rackt and made to confesse anie thing: the Spanish & the French meeting both in the bottome of the Cellar, conspire together in their cups, to lay the Englishman (if he euercome into their company) vnder the boord.
               
                  To be short, such strange mad musick doe they play vpon their Sacke-buttes, that if Candle-light beeing ouer come with the steeme of newe sweete Wines, when they are at worke, shoulde not tell them tis time to goe to bedde, they would make all the Hogges-heads that vse to come to the house, to dannce the Cannaries till they reeld againe.

               MAn (doubtlesse) was not created to bee an idle fellow, for then he should bee Gods Vagabond: he was made for other purpose then to be euer eating as swine: euer sleeping as Dormise: euer dumb as fishes in the Sea, or euer prating to no purpose, as Birdes of the ayre: he was not set in this Vniuersall Orchard to stand still as a Tree and so to bee cut downe, but to be cut downe if he should stand still. And to haue him remember this, he carries certaine Watches with Larums about him, that are euer striking: for all the Enginous Wheeles of the Soule are continually going: though the body lye neuer so fast bownde in Slumbers, the imagination runnes too and fro, the phantasie flyes round about, the vitall Spirits walke vp and downe, yea the very pulses shew actiuitie, and their hammers are still beating, so that euen in his

very dreames it is whispered in his eare that hee must bee dooing something.
               If hee had not these prompters at his elbowe, yet euerie member of his body (if it could speake would chide him) if they were put to no vse, cōsidering what noble workmanship is bestowed vpon them. For man no sooner gets vpon his legges, but they are made so that either hee may run or goe: when he is weary, they can giue him

and Coaches make such a thundring as if the world ranne vpon wheeles: at euerie corner, men, women, and children meete in such shoales, that postes are sette vp of purpose to strengthen the houses, least with iustling one another they should shoulder them downe. Besides, hammers are beating in one place, Tube hooping in another, Pots clincking in a third, water-tankards running at tilt in a fourth: heere are Porters sweating vnder burdens, there Marchants-men bearing bags of money, Chapmen (as if they were at Leape-frog) skippe out of one shop into another: Tradesmen (as if they were daūcing Galliards (are iusly) at Legges and neuer stand still: all are as busie as countrie Atturneyes at an Assises: how then can Idlenes thinke to inhabit heere?
               Yet the Worshipfull Sir, (that leades a Gentlemans life, and dooth nothing) though he comes but slowly on (as if hee trodde a French March) yet hee comes and with a great trayne at his tayle, as if the countrie had brought vp some Fellon to one of our Gayles, So is hee connaide by nine or tenne drowsie Malt-men, that lye nodding ouer their Sackes, and euen a moste sléepie and still Triumph begins his entrance at Bishopsgate.
               
               An armie of substantiall Housholders (moste of them liuing by the hardnesse of the hand) came in Battaile array, with spred Banners, bearing the Armes of their seuerall occupations to meete this Cowardly Generall and to beate him backe. But hee sommoning a parlee, hammered out such a strong Oration in praise of Ease
                  ▪ that they all strucke vp their Drums, flung vp their Round-Cappes, (and as if it had beene another William the Conqueror came marching in with him) and lodged him in the quietest streete in the Cittie, for so his Lazinesse requested.
               Hee then presently gaue licenses to all the Uintners, to keepe open house, and to emptye their Hogsheades to all

                  le away from them, and hanging out new bushes, that if men at their going out, could not sée the signe, yet they might not loose themselues in the bush. He likewise gaue order that dicing-houses, and bowling alleyes should be erected, wherupon a number of poore handy crafts-men, that before wrought night and day, made stocks to thēselues of ten groates, & crowns a peece, and what by Betting, Lurches, Rubbers and such tricks, they neuer tooke care for a good daies worke afterwards. For as Letchery is patron of al your Suburb Colledges, and sets vp Vaulting-houses, and Daunsing-Schooles: and as Drunkennesse when it least can stand, does best hold vp Alehouses, So Sloth is a founder of the Almeshouses first mentioned, & is a good Benefactor to these last.
               The Players prayed for his comming, they lost nothing by it, the comming in of tenne Embassadors was neuer so sweete to them, as this our sinne was: their houses smoakt euerye after noone with Stinkards, who were so glewed together in crowdes with the Steames of strong breath, that when they came foorth, their faces lookt as if they had beene perboylde: And this Comicall Tearme-time they hoped for, at the least all the summer, because tis giuen out that Sloth himselfe will come, and sit in the two-pennie galleries amongst the Gentlemen, and see their Knaueries and their pastimes.
               But alas! if these were the sorest diseases (Thou noblest City of the now-noblest Nation) that Idlenes does infect thee with: thou hast Phisick sufficient in thy selfe, to purge thy bodie of them. No, no, hee is not slothfull, that is onelye lazie, that onelye wastes his good houres, and his Siluer in Luxury, & licentious ease, or that onely (like a standing water) does nothing, but gather corruption: no, hee is the true Slothfull man that does no good.

                  Crueltie hath yet another part to play, it is acted (like the old Morralls at Maningtree) by Trades-men, marrye seuerall companies in the Cittie haue it in study, and they are neuer perfect in it, till the end of seauen yeares at least, at which time, they come off with it roundly. And this it is: When your seruants haue made themselues bondmen to inioy your fruitefull hand-maides, thats to lay, to haue an honest and thriuing Art to liue by: when they haue fared hardly with you by Indenture, & like your Beasts which carry you haue patiently borne al labours, and all wrongs you could lay vpon them.
               When you haue gathered the blossomes of their youth, and reaped the fruites of their strength, And that you can no longer (for shame) hold them in Captiuitie, but that by the lawes of your Country and of conscience you must vndoe their fetters, Then, euen then doe you hang moste weightes at their heeles, to make them sincke downe for

When they haue the fullnesse of welth to the brim, that it runs ouer, they scarce will suffer their poore Seruant to take that which runs at waste, nor to gather vp the wind-fals, when all the great trées, as if they grew in the garden of the Hesperides, are laden with golden apples: no, they would not haue them gleane the scattered eares of corne, though they themselues cary away ye full sheafes: as if Trades that were ordaind to be Communities, had lost their first priuiledges, and were now turnd to Monopolyes. But remember (ô you Rich men) that your Seruants are your adopted Children, they are naturalized into your bloud, and if you hurt theirs, you are guilty of letting out your owne, than which, what Cruelty can be greater?

                  Innocence punished.
                by beholding those vnnecessary tormentors go away wt scratchd hands, or torne legs from a poore Beast, arm'd onely by nature to defend himselfe against Violence: yet me thought this whipping of the blinde Beare, moued as much pittie in my breast towards him, as y• leading of poore starued wretches to the whipping posts in London (when they had more néede to be reléeued with foode) ought to moue the hearts of Cittizens, though it be the fashion now to laugh at the punishment.
            The last Chorus that came in, was an old Ape drest vp in a coate of changeable cullers (on horsebacke) and he rode his circuit with a couple of curres muzled,
                  No slaue like the soothing vp of fooles in their vices.
                that like two footemen ran on each side of his old Apes face, euer and anon leaping vp towards him and making a villanous noise with their chappes, as if they had had some great suites to his Apishnes, and that he by the haste he made had no leisure

to heare such base and bashfull Petitioners.
            The hunny that I sucked out of this weede, was this: That by séeing these, I called to minde the infortunate cō

                wherein the world hath béene so often in danger of béeing drowned, and waded onely in those cleare brookes, whose waters had their currents from the springs of learning. I spent my howres in reading of Histories, and for the laying out of a little time, receiued larger interest then the greatest vsurers doe for their money. By looking on those perspectiue glasses.

                  Excellence of Histories.

The backe of Time which was next to mine eie, (because he was gone from me) was written full of Tragicall wonders: but the hinder part of his reuerend head was bare and made bald by mens abusing it, O Histories! you soueraigne balmes to the bodyes of the dead, that preserue them more fresh then if they were aliue, kéepe ye fames of Princes from perishing, when marble monuments cannot

not saue their bones from being rotten, you faithfull entelligensers, betwéene Kingdomes and Kingdomes, your truest councellors to Kings, euen in their greatest dangers! Hast thou an ambition to be equall to Princes! read such bookes as are the Chronicles of Ages, gone before thée: there maiest thou finde lines drawre (if vertue be thy guide) to make thee paralell with the greatest Monarch:

            Whilest I dwelt vpon the contemplation of this happinesse, the dreames of Infants were not more harmelesse then my thoughts were, nor the slumbers of a conscience that hath no sting to kéepe it waking more delicate then the musicke which I found in reading; but the swéetest flower hath his withering, and euery pleasure his ending. This full Sea had a quicke fall, and the day that was warme and bright in the morning, had frosts and gloomy darknesse to spoile the beauty of it ere it grew to be noone: for on a suddaine all the aire was filled with noise, as if heauen had bin angry,
                  A Commotion.
                and chid the earth for her Villanies, people rush headlong together, like torrents running into the sea, full of fury in shew, but loosing the effect of doing violence▪ because they know not how to do it, their rage and madnesse burning in them like fire in wet straw, it made a great stinking smoake, but had no flame. Wildnesse and afrightment were ill fauouredly drawne in euery face, as if they had all come from acting some fresh murder, and that at euery step they were pursued, Arme was cryed, and swords were drawne, but either they had no hearts to strike, or no hands, for (like so many S. Georges on horse-backe) they threatned, but gaue

not a blow, euery one fearing to smite first, least the rest should make that an occasion to kill him for beginning the quarrell. But at the last drummes were heard to thunder, and trumpets to sound alarums, murmure ran vp & downe euery streete, and confusion did beate at the gates of euery City, men met together, and ran in heards like Deere frighted, or rather like Beares chased, or else séeking for prey. But what wild beasts (thinke you) were these that thus kept such a roaring?
                  O quantum cogit egestus
                it was a people sauage and desperate, a nation patchd vp (like a beggers cloake of ye worst péeces) that could be gathered out of all nations and put into one. They were more scattered then the Iewes, and more hated; more beggerly then the Irish, and more vnciuill; more hardy then the Switzers, and more brutish: giuen to drinke, more then the Dutch, to pride more then the French, to irreligion more then the Italian. They were like the Dunkirkes, a mingle mangle of countries,
                  VVhat vices are companions (for the most part) with pouerty.
                a confusion of languages, yet all vnderstanding one another. Such as the people were, such was the Princesse whom they followed, she had all their conditions, & they all hers, séeming to be made for no other purpose then to gouerne them, because none else could be bad inough to be their gouernour. They obeyed her not for loue, nor feare, but made her onely great amongst them, because it was their will to haue it so, she (amongst a number of vices, that reigned in her) hauing onely this vertue of a Prince, not to see her people take wrong.

A faithful & serious inquisition made I to vnderstād the cause of this suddaine and vniversall vprore, and by true intelligence (from persons of either side) found that ye quarrell was old, the enmity mortall, the enemies puissant and fierce,

                and what warlike Stratagems they stand vpon?
            I haue a little before roughly drawne the picture of one of them; the Princesse her selfe being barbarous, néedy, of great power by reason of her people, but far vnable to kéepe them in pay, or in order, they themselues (how valiant soeuer they bée) being likewise all together, vntrained and indisciplinable, yet full of courage, and desire to set vpon the Enemy.

               Whose Army though it consist not of such multitudes, (number being oftentimes the confusions of battailes) yet is the Empresse, vnder whose collours they fight, full of riches (which are the sinews of Warre) of great commaund, feared and loued, yea adored as a Diety, of a Maiesticall presence of incomparable bewty.

                that whetted on both his Prince and her subiects to go forward in these warres: for he could by no means abide either Money or her followers, it fretted him more to sée any of them prosper, then if himselfe had fallen into the lowest misfortune. He dealt altogether in Monopolies: for which the people gaue him many

bitter curses, and those (I thinke) kéepe his body so leane.

                was a goodly personage, a faithfull friend to his Prince, and a father to his country, a great Lawyer, & a déepe scholler, stout in warre, and prouident in peace. Pouerty (whom he serued) did often say, that two such councellors (as Industry) were able vpon their shoulders onely to support any State in the world. In deare yeeres, when the Land had beene ready to sterue, hath he reléeued it, and turned dearth into plenty: his head is euer full of cares, not for himselfe so much as for the people, whom hee loues and tenders as déerely as if they were his kindred: yet stand they not so well affected to him, because he compelles them to take paines, when tis their naturall inclination (like Drones) to liue basely, and to féede upon the bread that the sweat of other mens browes doe earne. A good States man he is, and a louer of peace, séeking rather to draw Money to be stil in league with Pouerty, then to haue them thus at defiance one against another.

               Beggery, and Miserie, are so well knowne to vs, I shall not néede to draw their faces.
            These councellors, after many arguments, weighed out to prooue the necessity either of warre or peace▪ at the last concluded vpon the former. The drumme was therefore struck vp, to

                Then went forth a uery streight command, to presse not onely all masterlesse men, but all others of what condition or profession soeuer, that liued vnder the subiection of Pouerty.

leagues, confederacies, & combinations of peace, they bitterly cryed out vpon the proud and tyranous gouernement of Money: some of them damning themselues to the pit of hell, if euer they could but finger her, they would see an vtter confusion and end of her: because for her sake, and vpon her golden promises they had ventured their liues, spent their blood, lost legs and armes, had béene pinched wt cold parched with heate▪ fed vpon cabbage, vpon rootes, & vpon Christmas day (in stead of minched pyes) had no better chéere then prouant (mouldy Holland chéfe, and course browne bread) not a rag to their backes, yes, rags more thē they cared for: but not thrée sti

               ers among fiue of them. They therefore uowed to serue Pouerty, to liue and dye wt her, and with all their forces to set vpon Money, who had made them slaues to the world, not rewarding thē to their merit: and thereupon striking vp their drum, and spreading their tottered cullors which hung full of honour, because it was full of holes, and was indéede no bigger, nay scarce so big, as the flagge of a Play-house, away they came (troopewise) with bag and baggage marching, and were receiued (as old soldiers should be) at the hands of Pouerty, she sweating by her birth, and the fame of her Ancestors (who were well knowne farre and néere) that she would neuer forsake their company, but sticke to them euen to the death.
            The businesse thus successefully thriuing at the first, gaue encouragement to all to haue it set forward,
                  Hals of euery company furnish men on both sides.
                so that precepts were forthwith directed to the Hals of euery Company, who albeit they had furnished the Queene of siluer and gold (Mony) with certaine voluntary hands of sound approued souldiers: Yet (because they themselues, that were old growne okes, cared not how many paltry low bushes that nestled vnder their shadowes were cut downe) they prest ten times more of euery trade, to fight vnder the banner of Pouerty, than those were that went to serue her enemy. Yet was it a long time ere the Handicrafts men could be mustred together:

               or a time abroad, whose counsel they following, threw by their tooles, neglected their trades fled from their shops, and spent both their gettings and their goods in common bowlingallies, dicing houses and alehouses. But proclamation being made, That vpon paine of death they should all (by such an howre) be ready to come into the field, and fight for Pouerty (their soueraigne Lady and mistres.) It is incredible to be spoken, what infinite multitudes of all occupations, (some yong, some old, were in a short time assembled together.
            
               Schollers hearing of this, fled from the Uniuersities, and made such hast to be in pay with Pouerty (whom they had knowne a long time) that some of them had scarce put shoes to their seete:
                  Learning held

                     n contempt.
                The Queene bestowed very good words vppon them, because Schollers had alwayes béene fauored by her progenitors, and (vpon her bare command) they tooke such place vnder her in the Army, as was sutable to their professions.
            Young Gentlemen, that neither durst walke vp and downe the Citty, for feare of Rauens and Rites, that houered to catch them in their tallons, and could get no entertainement in the court of Money, because they were yonger brothers, and condemned by the verduict of Silkemen and Mercers to be most Desperate fellowes: yet were they all wellcome to Pouerty.
            
            These yonger Brothers were appointed to stand Insans perdus (or the Forlorne hope) because though they had little to loose but their liues:Yonger brothers. yet they should wi

               te. And for that purpose did a goodly troupe of knights put them selues (as knights errant) into

Armes, in defence of ye innocent wronged Lady, (Pouerty) which Cheualiers, though they durst not (as some ill-tongd people gaue out) shew their heads in the Cittie: yet were they appointed Masters of the field, and had the charge of the most resolute troopes that were to scale the Cittie (If the enemie should cowardly happen to fly thether) and to ransacke all the Mercers and Gold-smiths shops, not so much to set frée the silkes, veluets, plate and iewels imprisond most cruelly in them, as to vndoe the old Cittizens, & then to marry their yong wiues, and so to raise them vp to honour in their most knightly posteritie.
            A regiment of old seruingmen were sworne the guard to Pouerties person,
                  Old Seruingmen the gaurd to Pouerty.
                of whom there was great hope, that they would both stand stifly to her in any danger, and if ye maine battailes did euer ioyne, would be the onely Canonéeres to breake their ranckes, because they had such excellent skill in charging and discharging of the great Bombard.
            There came in some seuen thousand Banckrouts,
                  Banckrowtes come to Pourty but as spies.
                offering their seruice to the distressed and wronged Princesse, who gaue them thankes for their loue: yet was she fearefull to trust them, because a number in her owne army exclaimed vpon them, as the ranckest villaines in a common wealth, and that they had vndone them, their wiues and children: But the dangers wherein they now all stoode, requiring rather hands to punish the wrongs done by an enemie, then to rip vp old wounds of their owne. Those seuen thousand had the ordering of all fire-workes, Mines, and countermines, as béeing the onely rare fellowes for damnable and spéedy blowing vp of men in any assault.
            The vanguard béeing filled vp thus with their troopes before named,
                  Masters vndon by seruants, serue in the Rareward.
                a stoute company of honest Housholders, (whose seruants like Acteons dogs, had with whoring, dicing▪ and drinking eaten vp their Masters) came brauely vp in the Reare: their wings consisted of schoolemasters, husbandmen, fencers, Knights of the Poste, and such like, who had all vowed by the crosse of their swords, and by the honour

of a souldier to die at Pouerties féete.
            It was in the middle of a Terme, when the fire of these ciuill broiles first began to kindle: but Law hauing with many hard words on both sides taken vp a number of brabling matters, and for her healths sake beeing rid into the country, whereby a great crew of her followers, that were not able with bag and baggage to march after her in that progresse) were ready to giue vp their cloakes, (the summer was so hot for them) and because all their practise was but to set people together by the eares,
                  Poore Attorneys.
                a number of them therfore vpon their bare knées, begd that they might serue Pouertie in her warres, whereupon certaine broken-héeld, gowtie-legd, durty-hamd pettifoggers, with some lack-latine prowling pennurious country Attorneys, were promoted to be Clarkes of Bands,
                  Pandors euer poore.
                Pandors, Pimpes, and Applesquires came thicke and thréefold, and had the leading of ye Pioners, because they had déepest skill in digging of Trenches.
            The victualers to the Camp, were a company of doublechind polt-footed,
                  Baudes seldom rich.
                stincking-breathd Bauds, who with pewter bottles of Aqua vitae at their girdles, rings with deaths heads on their fore fingers, and old stitchd hats, out of fashion on their heads, came along with the bag & baggage, and were ready if any poore soldier fainted, to put life into him againe by a sip from their bottles, and to lift vp his spirits.
            The whole Army being thus leuyed, Pouerty was found to be one hundred thousand strong in the field, whom martialling in the best order of warre, they marched forward wt full resolution, either to take Money and her subiects prisoners, or else neuer to come out of the field, so long as they & Pouertie (their mistresse and powrefull commander) could be able to hold life and soule together.
         
         
            
            The Preparation, strength, and stratagems of the second Armie.
            
               NO treason was euer so secretly contriued, so cunningly carried, nor so resolutely attempted: but either in the very growing vp it hath beene discouered, or the head of it cut off, where it was at point to come to the full ripenesse. The workes of Princes are great, and require many hands to finish them, and a number of engines cannot be set, going so closely, that no eare shall heare them: Ioue may talke in his big voice of thunder as soone and not be vnderstoode, as a kingdome may call vp her owne subiects with the yron tongue of warre, and not awaken those people that are her neighbours. The eies of a true State do neuer sléepe, Princes are quickest of hearing, the blowes that forraine enemies giue, are broken for the most part: because the weapon is alwaies séene and put by, otherwise they would cut déepe, and draw blood, where (by such preuention) they scarce giue bruises.
            This mercilesse tyrant therefore (Pouerty) could not kindle such fires of vprores, and ciuill mischiefes, but that the flames (like burning beacons) armed her enemies with safetie, euen as they put them into feare. Her ragged troopes were more apt to betray themselues and their procéedings, then polliticke to betray the foe into any danger. With swift wings therefore did the newes of this inuasion fly abroad into all countries, and at last alighted before that glorious and most adored Empresse (Money) whom néerest it concerned, because all the arrowes of their enuie and intended malice were shot at her bosome.
            The drom of warre beate in her eare, not in the dead of night, when her glories and beauties were darkened and

eclipsed, but when she was seated in the throne of all her pleasures (which a whole world was rifled and trauailed ouer to maintaine in height and fulnesse) when her pallate surfeited on the variety of dishes and delicacy of féeding,
                  The life of a sensuall man.
                when her body shone brighter then the sunne it selfe, who (in his lusty heate begot her) strucke an amazement into those that beh
                  •
               ld her, by the splendor of those maiesticall roabes which she wore: when musicke went into her eare in ten thousand seuerall shapes, when her walkes were perfumed, her sports varied euery hower, when her chéekes were dimpled with laughters at her iesters her Parasites, her Pandors, and all the rest of those seruile soothing Apes, that in pide colours waite vpon and shew trickes to sate the appetite of that Lord of flesh and bloud, the blacke Prince of the world, her husband. Then, euen then, in the full sea of all these iollities, pompes, and whorish ceremonies, the onely bewitchers of mankinde, came sayling in, the newes of a suddaine insurrection, and an vnexpected inuasion, by that common, fatall, and barbarous spoiler of so many kingdoms, infamous amongst al nations by that beggerly name of Pouerty.
            
            These newes (vpon the first arriuall) did no more moue the great Indian Empresse (Money) then the bleating of a shéepe terrifies the king of forrests (the Lyon.) Money was rich, strong in friends, held league with Princes, had whole countries at her becke, nations were her slaues, no people but did loue her. On the contrary side, Pouerty (her enemy) had small reuenues, fewer friends, a world of followers, but none of any reckoning, except a few Philosophers, Alchemists, &c. She held many townes, and was obeyed in most kingdomes, but how? as théeues are obeyed by true men, for feare, and because they cannot otherwise choose, her owne strength therefore being so good, and her enemies fuller of spite then of power, she onely laughed at the thunder of her threates, and resolued that her pleasure should spread larger sailes.
            
               But her councell being prouident, carefull, and iealous of their owne estates, wisely considering the dangers that a weake enemy (being desperate,
                  Riches make men cowards.
                and hauing little to loose) may put the best fortefied kingdome to, & the most valiant nation did in the end, with one consent fall on their knées, most humbly intreating thier Soueraigne Mistresse to giue ouer her reuellings, maskes, and other Court-pleasures for a time, and that aswell for the safety of her owne royall person (to take héede of them: for many plots were now, and had oftentimes bin laid) as also for themselues, whose liues and liberties wholly depended on her, either to leuy present forces, which should méete this beggerly Monarch in the field, and so vtterly to driue her out of the kingdome, or else to giue the rich men of her Empire leaue to make strict and seuere lawes to take away the liues of that wretched & scattered people that follow Pouerty in these commotions, wheresoeuer or whensoeuer they take them medling in any of her wealthy dominions.
            These words brake forth with such lighning, that Money stampd for very anger, that so base an enemy should put her subiects into feare. Their vigilance awaked her, and like a good Prince that would loose her life rather then her subiects should perish, she began (with the Eagle) to shake her royall wings, and to be rouz'd out of her late golden slumbers, & securities, that lay vpon her like enchantments.
            To their requests she yéelded, and thereupon to fortifie her kingdome against all the shot of Villany & Vengeance, shee summoned those of her councell together,
                  Councellors to Money.
                whom shee know to be most faithfull and most seruiceable in a busines of this nature, state & importance. Her councellors names were these.

                  Couetousnesse
               
               Couetousnesse was an old wretched leane fac'd fellow, that seldome sléep'd: for his eyes (though they were great, and suncke at least two inches into his head) neuer stood still, but rolled vp and downe, expressing a very enuious longing gréedinesse to enioy euery thing that they looked vpon. He neuer pared his nailes, and being often asked the reason why, he alwaies answered, that he saued them for his heire, for béeing cut off, after hée himselfe was dead, they might be put to sundry good thrifty purposes, as to make hornes (being thinly scraped) for a Scriueners lanthorne to write by a nights, or to nocke arrowes, &c. Hée kept not so much as a Barber, but shaued his owne head and beard himselfe, and when it came to wey a pound, hée sold it to a Frenchman to stuffe tennis balles. Money (his Soueraigne) cared not so much for him,
                  Couetous men are slaues to that which is a slaue to them.
                as he did for her, she could make him do any vile office how base soeuer; but because he was saucy, and would often checke her for taking her pleasures, séeking to restraine her of her liberties, she hated him, and was neuer more merry then when one brought her newes once that Couetousnesse lay a dying. Yet was he well beloued af the best Citizens, and neuer rode through the city but he was staid, and feasted by many Aldermen, and wealthy Commoners, few Courtiers loued him heartily, but onely made vse of him, because he was great, and could do much with Money (their empresse.)
            
               
                  Prouidence.
               
               Prouidence was but of meane birth, the ladder by which he climbd to such high fortunes, as to be a councellor to Money, being made by himselfe, much giuen to study, yet no great scholler, as desiring rather to be frée of the City, then to serue a long thréed-bare Prentiship in the Uniuersities. He is rarely séene in Minerals, and distillations, and will draw Aurum potabile, or fetch quick-siluer out of horsedung, he will grow rich, and be in time the head warden of a company, though he were left by his friends but thrée shillings thrée pence stocke to set vp, such another he was as Whittington, a very cat shall raise him if he be set vpon

He is great in Lawyers bookes, and tradesmen not onely loue him, but their yongest wiues, thinke themselues highly happy, if at a running at Tilt, at a maske or a play at Court, or so (as he oftē doth) he will but voutchsafe to place them (and the sports done) he commonly sends them home lighted.

                and Money hath done much for him. He purchaseth lands daily: but looseth: mens hearts, some of the richer sort follow him & loue him: yet he cannot go thorough the stréetes, but the common people curse him, hee reades Law as men reade Hebrew (backward) and neuer makes one Lawe, but he breaks two. Of all men, he cannot abide a Iustice of Peace, yet oftentimes is hee séene at the Sessions: many of his Ancestors haue béene Traytors, and by that meanes were still cut off before they were old men,

There is no more conscience in him then in Tauerne faggots, yet yong gentlemen pray for him daily that he may be fetched quick to hell. He is an insatiable féeder: for a Scriuener and he will eate vp foure men at a breakefast, and picke them to the bare bones. He loues not a Preacher, because hee frights him out of his wits: for he neuer heares any of them talke to him but he thinkes himselfe damned. He hath no skill in Arithmeticke, but onely in the rule of Interest. He is the Diuels Tole-taker, and when he dies, lies buried with his ancestors in the widest vault of hell.
            These were the councellors whom Money assembled together, to consult vpon hers and their owne safeties, from the base assaults of their wild and desperate enemy: who being solemnely set in their due places and the Quéene of Riches her selfe beeing aduanced vp into her imperial chaire, Parsimonie (who by this time was gotten vp and ready) tooke vpon him to be speaker for all the rest.

               This Parsimonie is a nasty batcheller of fourescore, one that neuer went trussed (to preuent hanging) to which end he will not be at charges of a paire of garters (though they were but woollen lists) for feare of temptation, his breches once were veluet, when his great grandfather wore them, and thrée-piled, but the pox of any pile can be seene there now, vnlesse betwéene the clifts of his buttocks, to saue a pennie, hee will damne halfe his soule, hee weares cloathes long, and will sooner alter his religion ten times, then his doublet once, his hatte is like his head, of the old blocke, he buies no gloues but of a groat a paire, and hauing worne them two daies hee quarrels with the poore Glouer that they are too wide, or too ill stitched, & by base

He will be knowne by a paire of white pumpes some 16. or 20. yeares, onely by repairing their decaied complection wt a péece of chalke. This whining Parsimonie (that for a supper of 16. pence will budge & slip his necke out of the coller from his owne father) and that vowes neuer to marry, because he will not spend so much as may kéepe a childe, stood vp so well as he could stand with his crinckling hammes, and knowing that it was high time for him to be stirre his

                     Silkemen.
                   & so they were. The silkemen guarded their very posts with gold lace, and thereupon euer since, the fashion of larding suites with so much lace is come vp: But aboue all,
                     Goldsmiths.
                   the Company of the Goldsmiths receiued her with the greatest honour, and she againe to pay their loues home, did as much or more honour them: for they spread all their stalles with gréene cotten, and so adorned their shoppes, that they looked like a spring garden, in which grew flowers of gold, set in such order, & comely equipage, it would haue rauished any poore mans eie to behold them. Here (in the very midst of the rowe) she allighted from her Chariot, staid a prety space, & enriched both the shopkéepers and their wiues with her presence, cheapning of 2. or 3. of them some of their fairest iewels, the beautie of their faces béeing of farre richer value then the costliest iewels there, and more worth (beeing rightly estimated) then the best stone in the whole rowe, and by this her staying at their stalles, heaped on their heads this grace besides. All her chosen Courtiers came hereby acquainted with their delicate wiues, and euer after their husbands had of them perpetuall custome. At last mounting againe into her Chariot

she rode on: being as richly attended as her selfe was glorious, Desert and Learning ran by her side as her footemē, Bounty guided the horses that drew her,

To second which prouident courses proclamations went presently forth to banish all those that were like to be of Pouerties company, for feare they should reuolt in time of most néede, wherupon many thousands, with bagge and baggage, were compelled to leaue the citie, and cling onely to the Suburbs.

               Scarce was the Herald turnd out at the Citty gates, but the glorious mother of Plenty, checking her owne great spirit, for giuing her enemy so much cause to triumph ouer her as to proclaime her a coward, was halfe mad with rage at her owne folly, and in that heate of bloud, charged her droms to strike vp, her colours to be spread, her armies to be put in array, and the gates of the City to be set wide open for (in a brauado) she vowed to issue forth, and bid battaile to the beggerly Tartarians that beleagerd her. But her councel (wiser then so) kept her in perforce, doubling the guards about her, and inchaunting her eare with all the bewitched tunes of musicke to cast her into a slumber till these stormes in her were at quiet, which if they had not done, but had pitched the field, as she once determined, it is▪ by many probabilities) thought, that Pouerty had had a great hand ouer her, and would haue put her to the worst. They therefore locked her vp, as it were by Iron force, compelling her against her frée-borne nature and condition, to be directed by them, and to lye close for a time, till noble aduantage

should call her into action: and making present vse of her owne former spéeches, a common councell was called: where by the generall head it was ordered that Hard-heartednesse should haue the keyes of the City in kéeping, his office and charge being, not to suffer Money to goe out of the gates, though she her selfe in proper person commanded it, and was further ordained that precepts should presently be drawne, into all Shires, Countries and Cities. The tenor of which precepts followeth.

                  These are to will and require you vpon especial and expresse commandement deliuered in our owne person, and as you will answere the contrary at your vtmost perrils. First that you (the said rich Farmers) by your best power, meanes, sleights, pollicies, by-waies, and thrifty endeuours, cast all the nets you can, to get all manner of graine that growes within your reach, and being so gotten to aduance, raise, and heighthen the prices of them, worke vpon the least inch of aduantage, make vse of all seasons, hot, cold, wet, dry,

Sweepe whole markets before you, as you passe through one towne, if you finde the corne (like mens consciences, and womens honesties) low-prized, & sell the same in other townes when the price is enhanced. Let the times be deere, though the grounds be fruitfull, and the Markets kept empty though your barnes (like Cormorants bellies) breake their butten-holes, and rather then any of Pouerties soldiers, who now range vp and downe the kingdome, besieging our Cities, & threatning the confusion, spoile and dishonour both of you and vs, should haue bread to relieue them. I charge you all vpon your allegiance, to hoord vp your corne till it be musty, and then bring it forth to infect these needy Barbarians, that the rot, scuruy, or some other infectious pestilent disease, may

                  we will and command, that you the young Land-lords, who haue cause to go dancing to Church after your old rotten fathers funerals, with all might & main stretch your rents, til the heart strings of those that dwell in them be ready to cracke in sunder. Racke your poore neighbours, call in old leases, and turne

                  Thirdly our high pleasure is, that all you Engrosers of what name soeuer, buy vp the prime and pride of all commodities, that done, keepe them in your hands, to cause a dearth, and in the time of deerenes, marke them with what price you list. First and principally, I charge you, as you loue me, and for my only sake, who haue euer beene good Lady to you all, that in times of plenty you transport your corne, butter, cheese and all needfull commoditiess into other countries, of purpose to famish and impouerish these hated whining wretches, that lye vpon the hands of

your Owne. Hire ware-houses, Vaults vnder ground, and cellers in the City, and in them imprison all necessary prouision for the belly, till the long nailes of famine breake open the dores, but suffer not you those treasured victuals, to haue their free liberties till you may make what prey you please of the buyers and cheapners. At which time I will prepare a certaine people that shall giue you your owne asking, and buy vp all you bring by the great, who shall afterwards sell it deerer then it was bought, by three parts, of purpose to choake this starueling scallion-eaters, whose breath is stinking in my nosthrils, and able to infect a quarter of the world. The people whom thus I promise to haue in a readines▪ are well knowne what they are, some call them Huksters or Haglers,
                  
                     Hagglers.
                   
                  but they are to me as honest Purueyers and Takers, and these politicke smooth faced Harpyes, shall out of a dearth raise a second deerenesse.
               
               
                  These and such like omitting my precepts, to Bakers,

                  Pouerty was somewhat grieued, (but little dismayed) at these tyranous, Godlesse and base procéedings of her enemy, because she herselfe and most of her army, haue béene old Sernitors to the warres, and béen familiarly acquainted with Emptinesse and Necessity, casting therefore all her troopes into seuerall rings, she went from one to one, and in the middest of each, councelled them all not to be disheartened, but with her to endure what miseries soeuer, sithente she would venture formost and fardest in any danger that could come vpon them. She told them by way of encouragement, that where as Money (their daring enemy) brags that she is the daughter to the Sun,
                     Pouerty comforteth her followers.
                   and Quéene of both the Indies. It is not so: for she is but of base birth bred, and begotten onely of the earth, whom she cannot deny to be her mother: and albeit it cannot be gainsayed, but that by her gripping of riches into her hands, she is owner of many faire buildings, parkes, forrests, &c. Yet doth she oftentimes so farre forget her high birth, (whereof shee vainly boasteth and those beauties of which a company of old Misers, Churles, & penny-fathers are with dotage enamoured, that now and then (like a base common harlot) she will lye with a Cobler, a Car-man, a Collier, nay with

the Diuels owne sonne and heire, a very damned broker, with these will she ly whole yeares together, they shall handle her, embrace her, abuse her and vse her body after any villainous manner to satisfie their insatiable lust, whereas on the contrary part, quoth she, I that am your leader, famous ouer all the world, by my name and stile of Pouerty, vnder whose enfignes, full of rents, as tokens of seruice and honour, you are all now come to fight, am well known to be a Princesse, neither so dangerous nor so base as Money shewes herselfe to be. Money makes all seruice done to her a very bondage in them that do it: those whom she fanours most, are her onely slaues; but Pouerty giues all her subiects liberty to range whither they list, to speake what they list,

assault of a Cittie. They that kept their dennes like Foxes in their holes, slept not, hearing such thundring: but armed themselues with as braue resolution to defend, as the other had to inuade.

Taylors swore to tickle the Mercers, & measure out their Sattins & velvets without a yard before their faces, when the prowdest of them all should not dare to say Bo to a Taylors Goose.

was as spéedily preuented by a countermine, so that all that labour tooke not such fire as was expected: yet went the Artillerie off on both sides, wilde fire flew from one to another, like squibs when Doctor Faustus goes to the diuell, arrowes flew faster then they did at a catte in a basket, whē Prince Arthur, or the Duke of Shordich strucke vp the drumme in the field, many bullets were spent, but no breach into Monies quarters could be made: they that fought vnder her cullers were very wary,

               Few attempts were after made to any purpose: onely certain yong prodigall Heires, who (as voluntaries) maintained themselues in seruice vnder Money, were appointed to be light-horsemen for discouery of the enemies forces (as she lay incamped) who now and then in a few light skirmishes had the honour to issue forth, and to set vpon the Assailants that beleagured the Cittie: but Pouertie still draue them either in to their owne shame, or else had them in execution (euen in despight of the Cittie forces) and put them euer to the worst.
               The Gold-beaters (who knew themselues on a sure ground within the walles) lingred of purpose, and would neuer bring it to a battaile, onely to wearie the aduersarie, whom they meant to vndoe by delay, because she could not hold out long for want of victuals. They within cared not though ten thousand diuels amongst them, so Money (their mistresse) whom they worshipped as a God, would not

                      your vncustom'd drooping Suppliants, the Vintners, and Innekeepers, and others of the Ale-draperie, that are bard out of the Cittie: Whereas through the extreame deadnesse of time and terme, we all run backward in our condition, hauing great rents to pay, and greater scores, which will neuer bee paid, guests now being glad if they can make vs take chalke for cheese, our wines lying dead vpon our hands, and complaining for want of good doings: we our selues making many signes to passengers, but few comming at vs, and hanging vp new bushes, yet hauing onely beggers hansell, trimming our roomes for no better men then Barbers and Taylors, a rapier scarce beeing seene in a veluet scabert within 40. yards of our precincts.

                  May it therefore please thee (O thou pay-mistresse to all the fidlers that should haunt our howses, if thou wouldest put them in tune) to send (at least) some of thy Harpers to sound their nine-penie musicke in our eares, but we rather humbly beg it, that thou wouldest enrich vs with thy Angellike-presence, be no longer percullized vp in the Citie, visit the subburbes, against thy comming all her cawseies shall be paued & made euen, how broken soeuer her conscience be left and vnmended. Our houses stand emptie, as if the plague were in them, onely for want of thee, our Drawers cannot be drawne to any goodnesse, nor our Hostlers to deale honestly with horse or man, onely by reason of thee: Issue therefore forth amongst good fellows, that will sooner fight for thee, then those snudges & miserable cormorants that now feede vpon thee.
               
               This lamentable supplication (together with the feare of a mutiny amongst her soldiers) so wrought with the Empresse, that (cleane against the perswasion of her councell) she determined to leaue the Cittie, and to march into the field: hereupon her Army Royall was set in order, to the intent she might take a full view of all her Colonels, Generals, Captaines and men of warre. She went from squadron to squadron, not so much delighting her owne eies wt beholding so many thousands ready to fight in her defence,

as they were gréedy to enioy her presence, which with braue encouragement lifted vp the deadest spirit, all swore to follow her, none to leaue her, or if any did, a curse was laid vpon him to die a begger.
               The first regiment consisted of Courtiers, some of them being Lords (who came very well prouided) some Knights,
                     Mony takes a view of all her army. Lords, Knights, Lawyers.
                   (but most of the valiant knights that were true soldiers indéed, serued in the other armie (Councellors at Law gaue directions where to encampe, what ground was best to defend themselues and annoy the foe, by what trickes and stratagems to circumuent her, how to leade the Troopes on, how to come off, and by plaine demonstration shewed how easie it was to put Pouertie to her shifts, and to haue her & her troopes in execution, if Money would be pleased to say the word, and for that purpose they made orations to set the armies together by the eares, which accordingly tooke effect,
                     Aturnies.
                   Attorneys were very busie, and serued as Clarkes to the Bandes, running vp and downe from one rancke to another expressing a kinde of puzled and dizzie distraction in all their businesses.
               But that which made the best shew of all,
                     Brokers come well armde.
                   was a lane of Brokers, who handled their Pieces passing well, & were old dog at a marke, they had skill in any weapon, Musket, Caliuer, Petronel, Harguibusse, a Crock, Pollax, Holbert, Browne-hill, Pike, Dimilance, sword, Bow and arrowes, nothing came amisse to them, and which was most strange they fought by the Booke, at a breach none so forward as they, they had beene at the ransacking of many a house, and would vndertake to vndoe all the troopes that were led by Pouertie. These Brokers were armed with thrumd cappes, (but they should haue had Murrions) and those they wore to keepe their wits from taking cold: for they had all diuellish heads, and were suited in sparke of veluet Iackets with out sleeues, tuft taffatie bréeches, close to them like Irish Stroozes, Sattin doublets with sagging bellies, as if

               The Inuader vnderstanding that the quarrell would be decided in a pitcht field, and that crackt crownes would be both giuen and taken on either side, grew excéeding ioyfull: and therefore calling for Sharker (one of her boldest & wittiest Heralds) him she sent to Money, to know where the Rendeuous should be made for both armies to meete in, and what péece of ground should be best famous to posterities by their battaile. Money tooke aduice vpon this, most of her old beaten Captaines, laboured earnestly to haue it at Bagshot, but all the gallants cryed baw waw at him that named Bagshot, so that for a quarter of an hower, none could be heard to speake, there was such a Baw wawing. The Herald Sharker, in name of his Mistresse, who sent him, requested it might be at beggers bush. But euery soldier swore that was a lowzy place, and so for a day or two, it rested vncertaine and vndetermined.
               In which Interim, a murmuring went vp and downe that not onely Pouerty had maintained this terrible Siege against the City,
                     Famine and the plague come along with Pouerty to besiege the City.
                   but that Dearth also, Famine and the Plague, were lately ioyned with the same Army, besides many strange and incurable diseases were crept into the camp, that followed Money: for Ryot her minion, was almost spent, and lay in a consumption. A hundred in a company were drowned in one night in French bowles: fiue times as many more were tormented with a terrible gnawing about their consciences. All the Usurers in the Army had hung themselues in chaines, within lesse then three howers, and all the Brokers, being their Bastards, went crying vp and downe, The Diuell, the Diuell, and thereupon because they should not disquiet the rest of the Soldiers, they were fetched away. These and such other vnexpected

                   put Money into many feares, doubts and distractions, so that she inwardly wished that these vnlucky warres had either neuer béene begun, or else that they were well ended▪ by the conclusion, if it might be, of some honourable peace.
               And as these stormes of misery fell upon Money and her troopes, so was the army of Pouerty plagued as much, or more on the other side: nothing could be heard amongst the Souldiers but cries, complaints, cursings, blasphemies, Oathes, and ten thousand other blacke and damned spirits, which euer hawnted them and their Generall herselfe. Want pinched them in the day, and wildnesse and rage kept them waking and raueing all the night. Their soules were desperate, their bodies consumed, they were weary of their liues, yet compelled to liue for furder miseries, and nothing did comfort them but a foolish hope they had to be reuenged vpon Money. So that so many plagues, so many diseases, so many troubles and inconueniencies following both the armies (by meanes of the tedious Siege) a perpetuall truce,
                     A Truce.
                   league and confederacy was confirmed by Money and Pouerty, and the councellors on either part: that in euery Kingdome, euery Shire, and euery City, the one should haue as much to doe as the other: that Pouerties subiects should be euer in a redinesse (as the Switzers are for pay) to fight for Money, if she craued their aid, & that Money againe should help them whensoeuer they did néede: and that sithence they were two Nations so mighty and so mingled together, and so dispersed into all parts of the world, that it was impossible to seuer them.
