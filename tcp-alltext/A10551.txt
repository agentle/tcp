                able Relation of many Viſitations by the Plague in times paſt, as well in other Countries as in the City of London, and the certaine cauſes thereof: With a true number of all thoſe that dyed in the laſt great Viſitation, at the comming in of King Iames: And alſo the number of all thoſe that haue dyed this preſent Viſitation; with two ſpeciall Medicines againſt the Plague.
            IT is no doubt, that the corruption of the Aire, together with vncleanly and vnwholſome keeping of dwell
                  •
               ng, where many are peſtred together, as alſo the not-obſeruing to haue fires priuate & publikely made as well within 
                  •
               ouſes, as without in the ſtreets, at times when the Aire is infected, are great occaſions to increaſe, corrupt, and produce peſtilent Diſeaſes. Neither can it be denyed, that the ouer-boldneſſe of many preaſing into infected places, and the lewdneſſe of others with Sores vpon them, preſuming into the open Ayre, ſome of wilfulneſſe, but truly many of neceſsity, contaminateth and corrupteth diuers: as the Leproſie, the Pocks, and ſundry ſuch vncleane diſeaſes doe: as by drinking, lying in company, and other ſuch meanes, where pure complexions and cleane blouds are defiled with ſuch as are putrified; and therefore carefully to be auoyded. But all theſe are accidentall, and rather effects then the cauſe. For it plainly appeareth in the Booke of Exodus, that when it pleaſed the Almighty God to ſmite the Aegyptians, the Children of Jſrael were appointed to dip Iſop in the Bloud of the Paſchall Lambe, and ſmite of that bloud on the outward Poſts of their dores, that when the ſlayer came to deſtroy in one night all the firſt borne in Aegypt, he might paſſe ouer the houſes of Gods children. So that it is plaine, it was an Angell then ſent to ſmite thoſe cruell people with the Peſtilence.
            Then firſt▪ this City of London, cannot be denyed, to haue had as great bleſsings as euer had Ieruſalem: for here God hath long time beene preſent by his Word and Sacraments, yet they haue abounded in all iniquity, when Ieruſalem long ſince had not a ſtone left vpon a ſtone.
            Secondly, London is ſituated as pleaſantly as Sodom, and her ſiſter Cities before they ſunke, euen for the ſame ſinnes that wee haue committed: for the ſinne of Sodom (ſaith the Prophet Ezechiel) was pride, fulneſſe of bread, and contempt of the poore. That theſe ſinnes raigne in London, who can deny? To them, adde fulneſſe of drinke; for therein wee exceede the Nation, that within theſe fifty yeeres wee hated for drunkenneſſe: and I doubt, That vnname▪able ſinne of Sodomy is vſed in too many places of the City. Yet London ſtands, and ſo God grant with his mercy it long may.
            Laſtly, where in the change of Princes, (eſpecially after long peace, as London moſt happily enioyed all the time of our late Soueraigne Queene Eli
                     ••

            In the City, called the great Caire, there is a Plague once euery ſeu

            In the yeere of Chriſt, 81. and in the yeere 188. there continued a great time a Plague in Rome, of which there dayly dyed two thouſand people.
            In the yeere 254. fifteene Prouinces of the Romane Empire, were in a manner conſumed with the Peſtilence.
            In the yeere 530▪ there dyed in Conſtantinople fiue thouſand a day, and diuers times ten thouſand: and at that time, in ſome other parts of Greece, there were not ſufficient liuing men left to bury their dead.
            And in the yeere 1569. there fell ſuch a Plague in Conſtantinople, that there died in ſix moneths ſpace, ſeuen hundred thouſand perſons, and the yeere following fell ſuch a famine, that a penny loafe of Bread of Engliſh money, was worth a crowne of gold: by reaſon whereof, the people died as faſt then of the Famine, as they did before of the Plague.
            In the yeere 540. there began an vniuerſall Plague all ouer the world, that continued 50. yeeres with great violence.

            In the yeere 1359. ſo great a Peſtilence there was in Italy, that there were ſcarce ten left of a thouſand.
            In the yeere 1521. there died in Rome a hundred thouſand of the Peſtilence.
            In the yeeres 1576. and 77. in Millan, Padua and 
                  Ʋenice, there fell a hundred thouſand in euery City: and in Bohemia (being but a ſmall Kingdome) here dyed three hundred thouſand the ſame time.
