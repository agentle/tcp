            Certayne rules of Geographie,
for the vnderſtanding of
Mappes and Chartes.
            THe perfect vnderſtanding of Mappes
and the vſe of the ſame dothe conſiſte
in the knowledge of theſe foure poynts.
            1 The neceſſarie circles deſcribed in
Mappes.
            2 The longitude & latitude of places.
            3 The Clymats and Paraleles.
            4 The meaſure of diſtaunce of one
place from another.
            
               1 Of the Circles.
               The circles expreſſed in Mappes are
fiue, the Equinoctiall, the 2. Tropikes, and
the two Polare circles.
               The Equinoctiall or Equator, is a circle
imagined iuſt in the midſt betweene
the two Poles, compaſſing the whole
earth about.
               1 This circle deuideth the worlde into
two equall parts, that is ſo ſaye, the

North and the South.
               2 It ſerueth alſo to know the Longitude
of places, which is meaſured vpon
it, and the Latitude which is meaſured
from it, either Northwarde or Southwarde.
               3 When the Sunne is in it, the day is
equall with the nighte throughout all
the worlde.
               4 When the Sunne is furtheſt from
it, the day is either ſhorteſt or longeſt.
               The Tropikes are thoſe circles which
the Sunne maketh about the worlde,
when it is furtheſt from the Equinoctial
either Northwarde or Southwarde.
               If it be Northwarde it is called the
Tropike of Cancer, bicauſe the Sunne
then returning backwardes entreth into
that ſigne.
               If it be Southwarde it is called the
Tropike of Capricorne, bicauſe then the
Sunne entreth into the ſigne of Capricorne.
               Theſe circles do deuide the temperate
Zones from the burnt Zone.
               
               
                  
The Polare circles are thoſe which the
Poles of the Zodiake doe make aboute
the Poles of the worlde, in the ſpace of
24. houres.
               They deuide the temperate Zones
from the colde Zones: and are ſo farre
diſtant from their Poles (that is, the Arctike
from the North, and the Antartike
from the South Pole) as the Tropikes
are from the Equinoctiall.
               
               The two Tropikes and the two Polare
circles do deuide the whole earthe
into fiue parts, which are called Zones.
Wherof that which lieth vnder the Equinoctiall
betwéene the two Tropikes,
is called the burnte Zone: the other
two betwixt either of the Tropikes and
the Polare circles are called Temperate
Zones: and the other two vnder either
Pole are called colde Zones.

               2 Of the Longitude and Latitude.
               In reckning ye Longitude of ye world,
the auncient Geographers tooke their
beginning at a right line imagined to be
drawne from the one Pole to the other,
by the Ilandes called the Canaries, beyonde
Hercules pillers (which lyne for
this purpoſe I call the VVeſterne line) ſo
that the Longitude of any place is the diſtaunce

of the ſame from that line Eaſtwarde,
and ſo rounde aboute vnto the
ſame line agayne.
               Some late writers do reckē the Longitude
frō the VVeſterne line Eaſtward
180. degrées, and alſo from the ſame
weſtward. 180. degrées, which béeing added
togither do make. 360. deſcribing it in
the middeſt betwene the two Poles, and
deuiding the world into. 2. equall partes,
wherof the Weſterne they call the Ponent,
and the Eaſterne the Levant.
               
               The latitude is the diſtaunce af any
place frō the Equinoctiall circle towards
either of the Poles.
               
               Where ſo euer you are, imagine a
poynt or pricke directly ouer your head,
which is called Zenith, the diſtāce wherof
from the VVeſterne lyne is the longitude,
and from the Equinoctiall the latitude.
And for this purpoſe in the vniuerſall
Chartes, you haue lines (called
Meridians) drawne in lengthe from
Pole to Pole, diſtant one from another
10. degrées, beginning at the VVeſterne
lyne, and ſo Eaſtwarde, which doe euidently

ſhew the Longitude of any place.
               There are alſo drawne certaine Paraleles
from the Equinoctiall towardes either
of the Poles, differing one from an
other. 10. degrées, declaring the Latitude.
               Note that the latitude or diſtance frō
the Equinoctiall line, and the eleuation
of the Pole in any place are equall.
            
            
               3 Of Climates and Paraleles.
               The Climates & Paraleles ſerue both
for one purpoſe, that is, the difference of
the longeſt dayes, whiche doe increaſe
within certayne ſpaces from the Equinoctiall
towards either of the Poles.
               
               A Climate is a ſpace of diſtance from
the Equinoctiall line, where the longeſt
day maketh difference of halfe an houre.
               The olde writers do make but ſeuen
Climates, and doe name them of ſome
notable and famous place.
               1 The firſt they name of Meroe a citie
in Afrike, vnder the burnte Zone, thys

               5 The fifte climate hath his name of

a great riuer in Scythia, whoſe brodneſſe
is. 3. g. 15. m.
beg. 47. g. 15. m dies lo. 15. h. 45. m.
end. 50. g 30. m 16. h. 15. m.
               Some do adde the eight Climat by the
South partes of England, and the ninth
by the riuer Tanais.
               
               The Southerne Climats, haue ye ſame
names, putting only this Greeke propoſition,
Anti, before them.
               A Paralele is iuſte halfe a Climate,
ſo that one Climate conteyneth two
Paraleles.
               
            
            
               
               4 The meaſure of diſtance of one
place from another.
               Diuers nations do diuerſly meaſure the
diſtance of places.
               The Egyptians by ſignes or markes.
               The Perſians by their Paraſangas.
               The Gréekes by furlonges.
               The Latines by miles, and ſometimes
by ſtones or markes.
               The Spaniards & Frenchmē by legues.
               The Germanes and diuers other natiōs
by myles, and thoſe of diuers length.
Thoſe which do write of theſe matters,
do all in a maner agrée in this, that
foure graynes of barly do make a finger.
               Foure fingers a hande.
               Foure hands a foote.
               Foure foote a Geometricall paſe, whiche
is two ſimple paſes.
               125. Geometricall paſes a furlong.
               8. Furlonges one mile.
               16. Furlongs a French league, which is
two Italian miles.
               3. Miles a great league.
               30. Furlongs one Paraſanga, which the

Perſians at this day call Faraſanga.
               
               40. Furlongs one Germaine mile.
               To apply your degrées to the finding
out of the diſtance of one place from an
other, by the number of miles (as they
are cōmonly taken amongſt vs in Englande)
you muſt vnderſtande that euery
degrée containeth. 60. miles on earth, ſo
that if you multiplie. 360. degrées, which
is the compaſſe of the Equinoctial, by. 60.
you ſhall finde the worlde to conteine aboute
the whole circumference of the
earth and water. 21600. miles.
               If you take your meaſure of diſtance
from the Equinoctiall line directly either
Northwarde or Southward, or elſe vppon
the Equinoctiall line Eaſtwarde or
Weſtwarde, you néede no more but
count your degrées, and for euery degrée
count. 60. miles: or if your Chart be true
in proportion, open your compaſſe as
wide as thoſe two places are aſunder,
whoſe diſtance you woulde knowe, and
apply the ſame to the Equinoctiall line,
and multiplye your degrées as before,
and ſo you ſhall haue your purpoſe.
               In particuler and Chorographical

Chartes you may finde the true diſtance
of any place from another, either by the
numbers of longitude and latitude deſcribed
in the margine of your Chart, or
by the Scale which is moſte commonly
made for that purpoſe. And if you wante
bothe theſe helpes, take any two places
wherof you knowe or may learne the
true diſtance, and meaſure that,
and according to that proportion
you may finde out
any diſtaunce in
the Chart.
