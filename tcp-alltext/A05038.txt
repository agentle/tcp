If the congregacyon of God do now fynde such ernest writers,Writers. as the seyd Moses, Luke, and Eusebius were, whych wyl not in these dayes rocke the cradle of Iesabel, Apoca. 2. or flatter the prelates & tyrauntes in all their idolatrouse whoremōgynges, they maye wele thynke they haue no lesse godly treasure than they were thē to the worlde, tyme for tyme and age for age.

                  My sentence is thys, that Christ ascended into heauen, and so hath forsaken the worlde, and there shall abyde, syttynge Syttynge. on the ryght hande of hys father without returnynge hyther agayne vntyll the generall dome. At what tyme he shall come from thens, to iudge the dead and lyuynge. Thys all do I beleue do ne in hys naturall body, whych he toke of the blessed vyrgyne Mary hys mother, in the whych he also suffered passyon for our sauetie and redempcyon vpon a crosse, whych dyed for vs & was buryed, ī whych he also ded aryse agayne to lyfe immortall. That Christ is thus ascended in hys man hede and naturall body, & so assūpt into heauen, we maye sone proue, for asGodhede. moch as the godhede of hym is neuer out of heauen, but euer replenyshynge both heauen and earthe, and all that is besydes fourth, beynge infynyte and intermynable or vncyrcumscriptyble, so that it neyther can propyrly eyther ascēde or descende, beynge without all alteracyon sand vnmutable or vnmoueable.

               By whych wordes of holy Augustyne, your grace maye euydently se that he testyfyeth and teacheth the blessed body or fleshe of Christ to be no where els thā in heauen. For to it beynge assumpt or ascended into heauen, God, as he sayth, hath geuen immortalyte, but not taken a waye nature▪ So that by the nature ofNature. that holy fleshe or bodye, it must occupye one place, wherfor it foloweth, Secundū hanc formam, that is to wyte, of hys fleshe, Christus non est putandus ubique diffusus. For if Christ shulde in hys humanyte be euery where dyffuded or spred abrode, so shuld hys bodyly nature or naturall body be taken from hym. And therfor he sayth. Cauendum enim, ne ita

               And yet do we reade agreably to the same matter, more largely in the same epystle, by these wordes▪ 
                  Christū dominū nostrū unigenitū Dei filium, equalē patri, eū

Thus fynde we clerely, that for the measure of hys very body he must be in one pla ce▪ and that of heauen as concernynge hysIn heauē. manhode▪ & yet euery where presēt in that he is the eternall sōne of God & egall to hys father. Lyke testymony doth he geue in the. xxx. treatyse that he maketh vpon the Euāgely of Iohā. These be hys wordes there writtē. Donec saeculum finiatur sursum est dominus, sed etiam hic est ueritas domini. Corpus enim domini in quo resurrexit,
                  
                  uno loco esse oportet. Veritas autem eius ubi
                     
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      diffusa. The first parcell, that is, Donec saeculū finiatur, is so put, that it maye ioy ne to the sentence goynge byfore, or els toSursum. these wordes folowynge. 
                     Sursū est dominus & caet. And so shuld it wele accorde to my sētēce byfore shewed, whych is, the lorde is so bodyly ascēded, that in hys naturall body he can not agayne returne from hea uen vntyll the generall dome.
               But how so euer the seyd clause or par cell be applyed, it shall not greatly skylle, for my sētēce notwithstādynge remay yneth full stedefast. In so moch, as the scripture doth mēcy
                     •
                  n but of. ij. aduc̄tes or cōmynges of Christ, of whych the first is perfourmed in hys blessyd in carnacyō, & the secōde is the cōmynge at the gene rall dōe. And furthermore i thys artycleCōmynge. of our Crede, Inde uēturus ē iudicare uiuos et mortuos, is not only shewed wherfor he shal cōe agayne, but also whā he shal cōe agayne. So that in the meane whyle, as the other artycle of our Crede witnessyth, Sedet ad dexterā Dei patris, that is not els to saye, thē he remayneth in glory with the father. Furthermore euē as I haue by fore rehearced the foreseyd auctoryte of Augustyne,

euen so haue I redde it in hys quinquagenes vpon a psalme, of whych I can not now precysely note or name the nombre. And the same wordes doth he also wryte in a pystle to S. Hierome. So that weAugustyne maye knowe, he had good lykynge in it, that he so commonly doth vse it, as hys vsuall prouerbe or byworde,
               In the same is also testyfyed, that hys blessed bodye can be but in one place, so that it beynge now accordynge to the scripture and artycle of our beleue or cre de, in heauē, it can not be in earthe. And moch lesse can it be in so vnnumerable places of the earthe, as we maye precey ue that the sacramēt is. Thus although the bodye of our sauer must be in one pla ce, as he writeth agreably to the sayngePetrus. of Peter, Quē oportet coelos accipere, us que ad tempus restitutionis omnium. Yet as the wordes folowynge make mencyon, ueritas autem eiꝰ ubique diffusa est. Thys veryte of Christ, or of hys bodye, do I take to be that he in other places, doth call uirtus sacramenti. As in the xxv. treatyse vpon Iohan we fynde thus writ ten. Aliud est sacramentū, aliud uirtus sacramenti. And agayne, Si quis manduca
                  
                  uerit ex ipso non moritur, sed qui pertinet ad uirtutem sacramenti, non qui pertinet aduisibile sacramentum. And to declare what is uirtus sacramenti, that I counte to be ueritasVirtus. domini uel corporis ipsius, he sayth.

So that in thys we maye vndoubtedly fynde that Christ, as touchynge hys man hede, cā not be corporally in ma nye and dyuerse places at ones, and so to be corporally in hys naturall bodye in heauen and also in the earthe, and that is moreouer, in so many partes of the worlde, as men haue affirmed.
               Neyther doth the scripture requyre that we shulde spoyle Christ of the propertiepropertie of mannys nature, whych is to be in one place, whom the same scripture doth perpetually wytnesse and teache to be man, and so to confounde the condycyō of hys bodyly nature with the nature dyuyne. Paule doth teache that Christ in

Thys is as if they wolde proue Christes bodye to be of one nature and propyrtie with hys sowle, and that thynges naturally corporall,The sowle. were not most dyuerse from creatures naturally spirytuall.
               Furthermore, if so it mought be, that the bodye or fleshe of Christ, were mere ly spyrituall, and full lyke vnto the substaūce of Angels, yet coulde it not ī thys wyse folowe, that hysbodye coulde be euery

                     •

Thys Marcio, agaynst whome Tertulyā doth thys write, ded erronyously reproue all creatures as cuyll. Whych thynge TertulianTertulyā

If Christ had iudged the breade euyll, then wolde he not haue left it for a sygne or sa crament to represent hys blessyd bodye. Agreably to the same doth he also saye in the fourth boke made agaynst the seyd Marcyon, in these wordes. Christus acceptum panem & distributum discipulis, corpus suū illud fecit. Hoc est corpus meum dicendo, id est figura corporis mei. Figura aūt nō fuis

Whych errour or heresye, thys famouse doctor Tertulyā doth improue by the holy sacrament, saynge as a fore is written.
               The sacrament is a fygure of Christes bodye, ergo Christ had a very & true bodye. For a thynge whych is vayne and

fantastycall can receyue no fygure. SoNote thys▪

And so doth the texte requyre to be expounded, for Christ was not a naturall stone, as all men maye wele perceyue, and yet was he the very true stone fyguratyuely, as Lyra sayth. Solet res quae significatLyramus, nomine rei quam significat nominari. And so is the stone sygnyfyenge Christ, called Christ whych therby is sygnyfyed. And as he doth approue thys texte, Petra erat Christus, lyke wyse doth he expounde, Sanguis est anima, with the whych he doth knytt thys texte, Hoc est corpus meum, to be fyguratyuely expounded, as they be.

And what els is thys, but that Christ wolde hys bodye to be eaten, and hys bloude to be dronken? But he wolde not hys bodye to be carnal

               Thys eatynge and drynkynge is nothynge, but such true faythe and beleue, as is shewed. Wherfor as Christ sayth, Qui manducat meā carnem, & bibit meum sā guinem, habet uitam aeternā.

No man is so folysh, that he wyll reproue vs for so sayenge, or to saye that we haue lyed forbycause we do call these dayes after the symylytude of those, in whych these thyn ges were done.

And the resurrectyon is sayd to be done in the same daye, through the celebratynge of the sacrament, of that whych is not done that daye, but longe tyme afore past. The thirde speache. Was not Christ offered vp ones for all in hys owne persone? Yet is he neuethelesse offered in the sacramēt mystycally for the people, not only euery yeare at the feast of Eastre, but also eue ry daye, Neyther doth he lye, whych whā he is demaunded, shall answere, that he is offered vp or sacrifysed.
               
                  For if the sacramentes had not aLykenes▪
                   certen symylytude of those thynges, of whych they be sacramentes, then shulde they not be sacramētes at all. By reason of whych symylytude, they do for the most part, receyue the denomynacyonor name of those thynges sygnyfyed. And therfor after a certē maner, the sacramēt of Chri stes bodye is the bodye of Christ, & the sa cramēt of Christes bloude is the bloude of Christ, & so also be the sacramētes of faythe called faythe. Thys doth he yet proue by an other axample of speache, whych is thys, It is nō other thynge to beleue, then to haue faythe. And therfor when answere is made, that the infantesInfantes haue faythe, whych in dede haue it not in full workynge, it is answered that soch haue faythe for the sacramēt of faythe, & that it doth cōuert it self vnto faythe, for the sacramēt of cōuersyon. For the uery answere it selfe, doth perteyne to the cele lebracyon of the sacramēt, & caet. Thus doth it suffycyētly apere, that as we vse truly to call that good frydaye, or the daye of Christes passyon, whych is not in dede the daye of Christes passyō, but onlyMemory all. 
                  a memory all therof ones done for euer. And as we vse to call the next Eastre daye, the daye of Christes
                  
resurreccyon, not bycause that Christ in the same daye shall aryse but only for a memoryall of hys resurreccyon ones done for euer, and that of longe tyme passed.
               And Christ beynde offered vp, ones for all in hys owne proper persone, is yet sayd to be offered vp, not only euery yeare at Easter, but also euery daye in the celebracyō of the sacramēt, bycause hys obla cyon ones for euer made, is therby repre sēted. Euē so (sayth Augustyne) is the saAugustyne. cramēt of Christes bodye, the body of Chri st, and the sacrament of Christes bloude, the bloude of Christ, in a certē wyse or fas hyon. Not that the sacrament is hys na turall bodye or bloude in dede, but that it is a memoryall or representacyon ther of, as the dayes before shewed, be of hys very and naturall bodye crucyfyed for vs, and of hys precyouse bloude shedde for the remyssyon of our synnes. And thus be the holy sygnes or sacramentes truly cal led by the names of the very thynges in them sygnifyed. But why so? For they (sayth Augustyne) haue a certen symySymylytude. lytude of those thynges wherof they be signes or sacramentes. For els they shul de be no sacramentes at all. And therfor

do they commenly, and for the most part receyue the denomynacyō of the thynges wherof they be sacramentes.
               So that we maye manyfestly preceyue that he calleth not the sacrament of Chri stes bodye and bloude, the very bodye & bloude of Christ, but as he sayd before. But yet he sayth, i a certē maner or wyse. Not that the sacramēt absolutely & playnely, is hys naturall bodye or bloude. For thye is a false argument of Sophystrye,Sophystry. whych they call secundum quid ad simpliciter, to saye, that the sacrament of Christes bodye, is in a certen wyse, the bodye of Christ, Ergo it is also playnely and expressely the naturall bodye of Chri st. For soch an other reason myght thys be also. Christ is after a certen maner a lyon, a lambe, and a dore. ergo Christ is a naturall lyon and lambe, or materyall dore. But the sacramēt of Christes bodye and bloude, is therfor called hys bodyeMemoryall. & bloude, that it is therof a memoryall, signe, sacrament, token, and representacy on, spent ones for our redēpcyon. Whych thynge is further expowned by an either speache, that he doth here consequently alledge of baptysme. Sicut de ipso baptismo

Apostolus dicit & caet.
               The Apostle (quoth Augustyne) sayth not, we haue sygnyfyed buryenge but he sayth vtterly, we▪ be buryed with Christ. For els shulde all false christē be buryed with Christ frō synne, whych yet do lyue in all synne. And therfor sayth Augstyne immedyatly theruppon, he called therfor the sacrament of so great a thynge, by nō other name, thē of the thynge selfe. ThusA name. o most gracyouse and godly prynce, do I confesse and knowledge, that the breade of the sacrament is truly Christes bodye, and the wyne to be truly hys bloude, accordynge to the wordes of the instytutyō of the same sacrament. But in a certen wyse, that is to wite, fyguratyuely, sacra mētally, or sygnyfycatyuely, accordige to the exposycyon of the doctors before recy ted & here after folowynge. And to thys exposycyon of the olde doctors. am I enforced both by the artycles of my crede, and also by the circūstaunces of the seydScripture. scripture, as after shall more largely ape re. But by the same can I not fynde, the naturall bodye of our sauer to be there naturally, but rather absent, both frō the sacrament & from all the worlde, collocat

In thys do I note, that accordynge to the exposycyons byfo re shewed, he calleth the sacramēt of bap tysme and the sacrament of Christes bodye & bloude, otherwyse properly named Eucharistia, he calleth thē signum Chri sti, and that in the syngular nomber, for as moch as they both do syngnyfye well nygh one thynge, In both thē is testyfyed the deathe of our sauer.
