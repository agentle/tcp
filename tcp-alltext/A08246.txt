            TO THE RIGHT WORshipfull, and worthy Louer of learning, and vertue, Maister Francis Coppinger, Esquire. A. N. wisheth all health and happinesse.
            
            
               HAuing (Right Worshipful) resolued with my selfe, to publish this little Treatise, & knowing it subject to much preiudice, except it were graced with some worthye Patron, (I meane not by the learned, for they are too courteous, to be Carping; nor by the well minded, for they cherrish Science: but by Detractors, who hauing no learning to iudge, want no libertie to reprooue) I haue followed the

example of Metabo. King of the Volschi, who desirous to deliuer his only Daughter frō al peril, & danger, consecrated and dedicated her to the Sister of the Surne. So I no lesse carefull of my labours, then the King of his Camilla, with deliberate, and aduised iudgement, wholy deuote, & offer my Booke to your fauour and protection; who being the true Maecenas of the Muses, and iudicial in their exercises, are of power to relieue my weaknes by your worthines, & to priuiledge me from enuy, though she were prest to deuoure me. If midst your generall fauour to all desert, your worship vouchsafe this particuler benefite to my industry; no day or time (as Tully counsaileth) shall define the memorie of your benefits: But as a true remembrance of your fauours, my future study and labour, shall be imployed to doe you all ready and willing seruice.

            To the Reader.
            
               GEntlemen, I here presume to present you with this little Treatise, occasioned chiefly by the late treacherous proceedings, although it bee mixed with various matter to please conceipt, because that hath already beene sufficiently handled by others. I know some wil look at it narrowly, and say the shape is but bad, though the operation may bee good. Zoylus with his squint eyes will finde fault both with matter and Methode: But I care not though they bee crabbed, if I finde you courteous. Let an Asse strike me, I will neuer lift my heele. And if Diogenes bee cynicall I will shake off his frumpes with Aristippus. Some odde scoffing companion that hath a common-wealth of Selfe-loue in his head, may perhappes say, the Subiect of this Pamphlet is more common then commendable: I answere him with a common principle of Philosophy.
            Bonum quò communis, cò melius.
            If that will not serue, let him eyther amend it or sit downe and blow his fingers, or else goe learne to knit Nets of couentry-blew for Woodcockes. I know (Gentlemen) fooles wil haue Bolts, and they will shoote them as well at a bush, as at a Bird: and some will haue frumpes, if it bee but to call their Father whoresonne: But howsoeuer, I knowe, facilius est cauillare quam corrigere, and a Dogge will haue a barking Tooth,

though he bee warned. To such I write not, let them be still vaine: but to those whom education and learning hath indued with curtesie and generous spirits. If I finde them respectiue of me, I haue the full desired end of my labours. Resting in hope, whereof I commit my selfe and my Booke to your fauorable censures.
            
               Yours
Antho: Nixon.
            
         
      
      
         
            
            The Blacke yeare.
            
               BY this yeares Reuolution, which is the Sunnes entrance into the signe of the martiall Ramme, there shall many blacke enormities, & dis commodities happen to the world: Men forgette those good vertues, which are naturally graffed in thē; whose effects bec, to doe good to others: and wherein the Image of God is resembled in man, and sensually cherrish their bodies with a moment of pleasure, to be after punished with an eternitie of paine. And shall follow the conditions of the world, dissembling still with the same, holding themselues happie that can flye from the seeing eye not from the sinne, that can applaud in publique and defraude in priuate. Such as bee rich, shall bee sure of friendes, But they that are poore, may spend money when they can get it. Those that haue no Mittens in Winter, may blow their nailes by authoritie, for no man will pittie thē that are needy: Such as carry empty purses, may dine by wit, if it will preuaile, or walke in Paules by Duke Humphry for Charitie is fled that should feede the hungrie. Old familiaritie shall bee forgotten, and friendship draw backe, if habilitie grow bare, according to that of the Poet.

                  
                  
                     Quem noui tacitus me praeterit: Os mihi claudit paupertas, cum &c.
                  
               
            
            Many men for lacke of witte, shall followe Bacchus, not Ceres, and esteeme better of mault, then wheate: and many for lacke of honestie shall swell by Venus, and make more reckoning of a Chamber then a Church. The greatest holinesse shall not be in the granest shewe; nor the longest bearded prooue the wisest. Many by superfluities, & inordinate repastes shall winne vnder the froath of Lust, and by Gluttony, not onelye sinne in Letchery, but sincke in blockishnes and folly. For Pinguis venter non generat subtilem sensum. Many shal be so new-fangle in their formes of apparrell, that a new fashion shall scarcelye appeare in the French Kings Kitchin, but it shall be presently translated ouer into the Court of England. But that shal cause Mercers to haue many bad debtors, and make Catchpoles to be Gentlemen, for like bug-beares they shal cause such as feare them to flye from them: for they are as terrible to the sight of a poore debtor, as a Butchers knife to an Essex Calfe, or a cup of small Beere to an Ale-knight in a frosty morning. Such as keepe not day shall faile to borrowe when they neede. Crackt-credit shall haue lesse commoditie, and pennuty shall bee bought with Repentance by such Gentlemen as sell land in reuertion, while their fathers are liuing. Diuers shal this yere be so cōuersant with Venus, that by pleasing her they shall displease thēselues, & surfet with such a heate after their labour, yt the very haires shal be banished frō their heads, & poore Barbers be made beggers for wāt of work. Such as climbe aboue their reach shall be sure of a counterchecke, and such as plot treachery shall haue a halter for their labour, and Derick shal make

               Traytors shall couet to flye like Swallowes,
               Fearing their secrets to be reuealed:
               And Pope-sworne Tretchers shall kisse the gallowes,
               Their cunning plots shall not be concealed,
               In their best hopes they haue euer failed,
               Then what befell to Catesby and that crew,
               Befall to them that are not subiects true.
            
            This yeare shall be bad to such as buy sutes in Birchinlane vpon credit, for eyther they shall bee badly sowed, Or if the outside deceaue them not, yet shall the inside bee all olde stuffe, and no sooner on but a seame out. Some Bookesellers this yeare shall not haue cause to boast of their winnings, for that many write, that flowe with phrases, and yet are barrein in substance, and such are neyther wise, nor wittye: others are so concise, that you neede a comentarie to vnderstand them, others haue good wittes, but so criticall, that they arraigne other mens works at the Tribunall seate of euery censurious Aristarchs vnderstanding, when their owne are sacrificed in Paules Churchyard for bringing in the Dutch Curtezan to corrupt English conditions, and sent away Westward for carping both at Court, Cittie and countrie. For they are so sodaine witted, that a Flea can no sooner friske foorth, but they must needs cōment on her. Others shal be so subiect to affectiō, that whē they haue don any thing worthy of praise, they eyther like Hennes that goe cackling, in regard of their new laid Egge, and blaze their owne workes abroad, or indeauour by secret insinuation to bee commended by others, as the Italian Poet did, who hauing made an Epigram which much pleased himselfe, shewed it to some of his friendes, praysing it aboue the skies:

            Doctor Aloander with a myraculous insight, espied that by reason of some retrograde influence it should happen, that this yeare, many Countries shall bee highly troubled with warres, Commotions, sicknesses, and Plagues. The Spirit (saith hee) among the Godlyc shall warre with the flesh, and honest plaine dealing shall bee at deadly fewde with Peter Pick-thanks secret insinuation. A dreadfull debate shall be betwixt the Wife and the Husband, who shall beare moste sway and authoritie: insomuch as the wife shall sitte playing in the Chamber aboue, when the Husband shall stand working in the shop belowc. There shall be also as much strife among Players, who shall haue the greatest Auditory, as is warre among the foure knaues at Cardes, for superioritic. Brokers and Vsurers shall so pinch the poore this yeare, that for euer after, they shall be no better then Knaues by estimation. Land-lords and Lease-mongers shall peele their Tennants, raysing rents, and taking houses ouer mens heads, to the vndoing of Man, wife and Children. Gentlemen that were wont to keepe good houses, and maintaine Hospitalitie in the Countrie, shall this yeare depart from thence, giuing ouethouse keeping, and come to London, And eyther keepe a chāber there, or waite at the Court (vncalled) with a man, and a Lackey after him, where he was wont to maintaine halfe a score proper men to attend on him, and thirtye or fortie other persons besides, euery day in the weeke.
            
               
Tapsters shall this yeare in Sommer, be indyted for mingling their bottle Ale with small Beere, and Ale-wiues in winter for filling three pots to one toste, and for selling flesh on Frydaies without lycence. Many black tempests shall be in Taphouses, for Cannes shall flye about, (and light on mens heads) without winges: and with the rich, poore men shall bee accounted knaues without occasion.
            Some shall be so costiue in their stomackes, as they shall cary hollowe hearts vnder holy shapes, and weare braue hoodes, that haue but bare learning. Those that can flatter least, shall speede worst, Qui nescit dissimulare, nescit vi

               For tell but Quintus, that his breath doth stincke,

               For now who loues to play a worldlings part,
               Must teach his tongue refraine to tell his heart.

               And sweare that's rare, which doth deserue no grace,

            In this dangerous yeare shal happen many Combattes

betweene the flesh & the spirit, & our inordinate passions (will wee nill wee) shall not cease almost hourely to rise vp against Reason, and so molest vs, perturbting our rest and inward quietnes. For example whereof I wil recite vnto you, what was related in the life of S. Anselme: once Archbishop of Canterbury, that as hee walked into the fields, he saw a Shepheards little Boy, who had caught a Bird and In vita Anselmi. tyed a stone to her legge with a thrid, and euer as the Bird mounted vp to soare aloft, the stone drewe her downe againe. The reuerend old man much mooued at this sight, fell presently a weeping; lamenting thereby the miserable conditions of men, who no sooner indeauour to ascend to heauen by contemplation, but the flesh hales the heart backe againe, and drawes to earth, enforcing the soule to lye there like a Beast, which should haue soared in the heauens like an Angell.
            Some shall haue so much wit, that they shall surfet on it and striue so long against the streame, as their bodyes shall faile to carrie their heads any longer. Some shall haue such large consciences, as they shall build fayre houses by briberie, gather much wealth by contention and crueltie, and ere they are aware, heap vp riches for an other, & wretchednesse for themselues. For

                  Vna opibus poterit nox quo

            Water shall this yeare bee so weake an Element in the world, that men and women shall scarce haue teares sufficient to bewaile their sins: and there shall be such a dearth of Onyons, that Widdowes shal want moysture to follow their Husbands to their Funeralles. Fewe shall wax beggers by giuing of Almes, for in our time the world is so far from giuing, as a Nigards purse will scarce bequeath his maister a good dinner. Many shall be so seduced by blinde

opinions, that digging a pit for others, they shall fall into it themselues, and cry peccaui when the Popes pardon shall not preuaile against their Treachery. Coyne shall

Few that are poore shal haue more money then they need, and many that are wealthy, not so much wit as they want.
            The hearts of the wicked shall be so hardned, as they shall say,

            It is hard (saith Aristotle) to finde a man, which in prosperitie 
                  Arist. Li. Li. 2. Rhetor. ad Theodectten. cap. 10 is not proud, disdainful, & arrogāt, such are many, whome strength, whome ritches, whome Clyents, whom authoritie, whome fauour hath exalted: for if dignitie and honour (which seldome make men better) bee oftentimes lincked to this diuelish behauiour, what can be looked for else, but many prodigious monsters, hurtful to men, & execrable before God: according to that

                  Asperius misero nilest, dum surgit in altum.
               
            
            Yet howe sodenlye they haue consumed and come to fearefull ends, there need not be called to minde any long fore-passed remembrance to testifie.
            Many shall this yere haue their eyes so dazeled, as they shall not knowe themselues, many so pust with pryde as striuing beyond their compasse, they shall crye peccaui in the Poultrye, for their borrowed brauerie. Manye shall bee troubled with that fault, which Tully calles Defectum naturae, (cowardice, or weakenes of spirrit)

that their finger shall no sooner ake, but they must straite to the Physition, & so inrich him, impouerish themselues, and yet neuer be without diseases.
            
               This yeare shall be Cares, and griefe of minde,
               And alteration of weather some where:
               It shall be hard iudging for men that are blinde,
               As by wandring the wrong way may appeare.
               Of all things true friendship, shall be most deare,

               Take good heede of Guato and his Disciple:
               Rents shall be raised double, and triple,

               Young women and Widdowes, both wise and mad.
            
            
               The poore shall be vext with such paine i'th purse,
               As he that lackes money, may also lacke meate:
               The Vsurer shall haue the beggers curse,
               Ambition shall striue for honours seate:
               Mault shall cause many to sell their wheate,
               The Cuckowe in Summer shall temper his throate,
               To pipe mine Hostesse a merrie note.
            
            Diuers shall be troubled with a defect, and imperfection that proceedes from the corruption of nature, namelye with Curiositie or a diligent inquisition of other mens faults, and an extreame negligence in their owne. Moalehilles

in other men shall seeme mountaines, and craggye Rocks in themselues, smooth rushes: Other mens faultes shall bee before their eyes, but their owne behinde their backes. The reason why men iudge more quickly other mens follies then their own, partly proceedes from Selfe-loue, which blindeth them in their owne actions, partly because they see other mens defects directly, and their owne by a certaine reflexion, For as no man knoweth his owne face, because he neuer see it, but by reflexion from a glasse, and other mens countenances, hee conceaueth moste perfectly, because he viewes them dyrectly, & in themselues, So by a certaine circle we winde about our selues, whereas by a right liue wee passe into the corners of other mens soules at least by rash iudgements and sinister suspitions. Galen to this purpose relateth Aesop, who said, euery man Galen. de cog. amin. Morb. C. 2. had a wallet hang'd vpon his shoulders, the one halfe vpon our brest, the other halfe vpon our backes: the former was full of other mens faults, which we continually beheld, the part behinde loaden with our owne offences, which wee neuer regarded.
            Some shall haue too much familiaritie with scoffing, & gibing, the which proceedes from pride and enuie, and is hardly continued without dissention, for men are not at all times apt to receiue iestes. Many that in conuersing are (for a time) able to discourse wel, shal after that time their oyle is spent, thrust out all they haue on a sodaine, and after become verie barren. Such are they that at a Table wil haue all talke, when others in place shall be silent, that are better able then themselues to vse effectual speech in any matter propounded. But these men are commonly neither witty, nor humble, for wittie men are seldome drawne drie in their conceipts, and humble men will distill their knowledge

according to their talents, & not aboue their reach.
            Some shall haue such nimblenes in their choppes, as they shall deuoure more at a meale, then they are able to pay for in a month. Some such a buzzing in their brayne, as they shall not admitte good counsaile or admonition, but shall esteeme better of their own vnstayed, and headstrong resolution, then the graue aduice of Time-bought experience. To such is assigned a whip of nettles to scourge their Sic volo with Noli poenitentiam tanti emere. If that will not serue the turne:

                  A pound of Hempe, three Standers, and three flattes,
                  Are very fit to make such mates new hattes.
               
            
            Some shall be stopt in their heartes with such an Aconiton of obediencie, as they shall bee vtterly obstinate to receiue the Antidote of grace, and so be giuen ouer to a reprobate sence, that they shal perseuet in vanitie, without any touch or feeling of their follie. Such without mature Repentance & amendment shal neuer attaine that caelestiall land, nor inioy that heauenly repast, which

                  Nemo nouit nisi qui accipit.
               
            
            Many that are wicked and vnlearned, impudent in face, and egregious Parasites in behauiour, shall be exalted to glorie, when men famous, as well for learning as religion, shall be eyther condemned, or of Sycophantes defaced, or for some small occasion vnworthily disgraded. As hapned to Beliserius, who lost his eyes by Iustinian.
            
            Darknes shall not abide the light, nor ignorāce (through her Impudency) refraine to set herselfe against learning and knowledge, For as Quintilian doth witnesse, Quo quis

But whatsoeuer they heare, they shall presently blab foorth, & often times make a matter worse in telling. Some others shall haue such lightnesse in their braines, that albeit they know little, yet they shall meddle much, and thrust themselues so farre into others affayres, that for lacke oflooking into their owne, they shall eyther daunce a Beggers Galliard, or feele the price of such follies as follow Hadiwistes. There shal be also such various wonders, such strange inundations, such miraculous comotions, as such as want legges shall be glad to goe on crutches and such as lost their horses and carres at the last Lotterie, and pawnd their

                  Si quis in hoc mundo vult cunctis gratus haberi
                  det capiat, quarat, plurima pauca, nihil.

            Gamesters, and such as consecrate themselues to play at Dice, Cardes, and such other games, shall haue bad fortune this yeare, for in a minute they shall lose more then they can gather againe in a month. These are vnprofitable Members, and deserue to bee cut from the bodye of a

            Tydes shall this yeare mount beyond their boundes, insomuch as many striuing to stretch beyōd compasse shal so heate themselues on New-market-heath, that they shall be constrained to coole their heeles in New-gate, where they are no sooner arryued, but foure knaues in the cardes shall sodenly leape from out the bunch, and desperately be ready (as partners) to entertaine them. This black yeare threatens diuers and sundty sortes of Takers, for some one shall be desirous to be taken for wise, who is indeede Sapientum octauus. Some will bee glad to take bad Siluer of poore debtors, and a Bottle of Ale, when they cannot get a pottle of wine. Some shall take their neighbours bed for their owne: some the Maide for the Mistresse, especially in houses, where Virgo is so predominant with the Maister, and wants a Mistresse to looke, narrowly vnto her.
            This yeare is vnlikely to be fauourable to Maisterlesse men, and pennyles companions, for hee that has but one shirt to shift him, may not thinke scorne to weare a fowle on Sundaie. Tripe-wines should bee exquisite Phisitions, for in one of

                  But now Seria iocis.
                  
               
            
            There are besides these, many other accidents that may serue to shew the many enormities, wherewith humaine conditions make their soules blacke, and putrified, for wee see all men grow A malo ad peius, and all thinges we perceiue to waxe dayly worse, and worse, and to decrease in their vertue. The ayre is oftentimes corrupt, sometimes with vntimely showres, sometimes with vnprofitable drinesse: now with two much colde, now with extreame heate. The fruitfulnesse of the field is not such as it hath beene before time. Ritches, and substance we see consumed, the progeny of Noble men we perceiue not to be multiplyed, but decreased either by discord or disloyaltie. Lords and great men bend their cogitations to the oppressing of their poore Tennants, and by often fines, and exactions, bring honest men to beggery, and by the example of Pharo make Slaues of their Seruants and Subiects.
            Another great argument of this yeares, (or rather of the worldes corruption) is, that all good artes and learning are so contemned and little rewarded, or respected. The Vniuersities, Schooles and Scelestiall Discipline, (which are the causes and fountaines of knowledge) now pilipended, and not regarded. Although God in this last age, hath shewed his good will, and maruellous loue towards vs, especially (in that so great barbarousnesse of our Predecessors, when all artes and liberall learning, was hid, and knowne to fewe, the Latine tongue polluted: the faculties not apprehended) by raysing vp so many learned men, which with great study & paines, haue brought all the Scyences to their puritie, and deliuered vnto vs a more easie way, to the attaining the perfect knowledge of them all.
            
               
Yet experience teacheth that these guestes that haue of long time beene at the ful, doe now decrease, and grow to be lessend. For not that aduised iudgement, not that industry, not those exercises in studies, are now which haue beene. Euerie man hath his particuler manner of parley, striues to speake in print, hunts after Metaphors, coynes Phrases, and labours extreamely that his words may smell of subtilty, elegancie, and neate deliuerie, in such affected sort, hat for the moste he leaues nothing behinde him, but a sent of verball pride and foolish affection.
            This is that time wherein aboundeth marueilous securitie. By which ariseth not onelye in
                  •
               ffable wickednesse against God, but also a lamentable disorder and confusion in common-weales. For if wee compare the time present with that which is past, wee shall perceiue vice to haue come to his ripenesse, and to raigne (almost) without controlement.

               or (notwithstanding God hath giuen vs discipline whereby we are taught to frame our affections to his will, and to dwell in vnity according to his word) what desire of good life, or zeale in religion is there to be found? Many a man thinkes himselfe sufficiently religious, if hee can seemingly fashion himselfe to the frequenting of Sermons, and repayring to ordinarie seruice and ceremonies, when

                  —Fronte politus.

            Many thinke well of themselues in making the Doctrine of loue, peace, and vnity, the occasion of strife, contention and heresie. Many suppose they serue God well, (if knowing some of contrarie opinion, though not in the chiefest point of Religion) they doc condemne them with wordes, and commit them with curses to the Deuils punnishment:

when they themselues in the meane time, in a certaine spirituall pride, and pust vp through a vaine opynion of learning, doe take heart of grace.

            These and the like vices both Poets, and Philosophers reprehended in their daies, whē wickednes did but spring, as they themselues haue testified. Then how earnestlye is God to be desired, that the times may now be bettered & these euils redressed. For albeit all manner of wickednesse hath in this age ascended verie high, yet are they not so come to the toppe, but that more horrid, and mischeuous confusions then euer were, may bee seene in Commonweales through euill gouernment. We may continuallye perceiue that such as are Parasites, and Flatterers, that can temporize, and sort their humors to be pleasing, beate all then braines, (

            It is therefore to be wished, that all Christian Princes would carefullye commit these wordes to contynuall remembrance? you shall know them by their frute. Men doe not gather grapes of Thornes, or Figges of Thistles. And againe, A naughty tree cannot bring forth good frute. What

But because (in respect of this title to this small discourse,) it may perhaps bee expected that somewhat bee spoken of the late insolent and trayterous practise of Pearcy and his conspiracie, which I confesse there hath aready been much learnedly written, and for that among other coloured and shadowed courses for their Rebellion, this principally was one: namely to reforme religion, and for his, and their conscience sake: whose Religion (if they had any) whereof they made outward shewe and profession, was according to the Romish Church, taught & brought heather from the Shambles, & Slaughter-house of soules, (I meane the Church of Rome) & continued heere by Iesuites, and Seminarie-Priestes, who closely, and in disguised manner steale into this Land, and seduce and drawe many soules of men from the true loue, and worship of God and his will, and from their natiue loyaltie and obedience to their King and Countrie. I haue in regard thereof set downe these speciall points ensuing: by which the church of Rome is made so glorious, & which are stifly taught, & maintained by it, that it may be iudged and censured whether it be the true Spouse of Christ: or on the contrarie, whether it be not the false Church, and the apparant sinck and Synagogue of Sathan.
            1. First, whereas the Church of Rome will be known to be the true church, by the Visibilitie, Antiquitie and multitude thereof, and so bee seene and pointed at with the outward eye, and finger: you shall finde that Visibilitie, Antiquitie, & multitude, are not the markes of the true Church but a little flocke, few in number and yet of greatest Antiquitie: as by these places may appeare. For tell me I pray Act. 8. 1. you where the Church was visible, when being assembled at Ierusalem, there arose agreat persecution against it, insomuch

Iohn in his Reuelation expresly witnesse, Reuel. 12. 6. 7. that the church of Christ (signified there by a woman) fled into a desert or wildetnesse, where shee had a place prepared for her of God, and where she could not for a certaine season be found of the persecutors?

            3. Thirdly, the Church of Rome teacheth, that the Scriptures

                but vnto God, for no man heareth him, howbeit, in the spirit hee speaketh secret thinges. Hee that speaketh in a

strange language edifieth himselfe. I would that you al spake strange languages, but rather that you prophecied. For greater is hee that prophecieth, then hee that speaketh diuers tongues, except he expound it, that the church may receaue edification.
            And now bretheren, if I come vnto you speaking diuers tongues, what shall it profit you? &c. Morcouer things without life which giue a sound, whether it bee Harpe or Pipe, except they haue a distinction in the sound, how shall it bee knowne what is piped, or harped? So likewise by the tongue except you vtter wordes which haue signification, how shall it be vnderstood what is spokē, for you shal speak in the ayre.
            4. Fourthly, The Church of Rome doth teach there is a Purgatorie, Christ in the Gospell, sheweth onely two places, namely heauen and hell. Christ said to the good Theefe, this day shalt thou bee with me in Paradlce, Christ saith, verily,

            Againe, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord; from hence foorth they rest from their labours, and their workes followe them. And Saint Peter, telleth the Sa

            6. Sixtly, the Church of Rome deliuereth the Sacrament, 
                     〈◊〉
                   in one kind, namely bread. Christ saith, Drink ye all of this Cup. 
               Mat. 26. 27 1. Cor. 11. 23. 28. Paul saith, Let a man examine himselfe, and so let him 
                     •
                  ate of this bread, and drinke of this Cup.
            
            7. Seauenthly, The Church of Rome holdeth Transubstantiation in the Sacrament, and this they would seeme to ground vpon these wordes. This is my bodie▪ which they wil haue to be expounded liberally. But why then doe they not expound the wordes of Christ literally also concerning the cupp? For the Text saith, in the 27. and 28. verses, that he tooke the Cup and said, this is my blood: I am sure they wil not say that the Cup was the blood of Christ, (as the wordes bee) but they will graunt a signe in those wordes, namely, that by the Cup is meant, the wine in it.
            If then they will admitte a figure in this, why may there not be a figure in the other? namely, this is my body, should be vnderstood thus: This bread is a figure of my body, (which was broken for you,) circumcision was called the Lordes couenant, when indeed it was not the couenant. So likewise the Pascall Lamb is called the Passouer, when indeed it was but a signe of the Passouer.
            Christ saith, Doe this in remembrance of mee. And Saint Paul saith plainelye, and expresly, that the communicants 1. Cor. 1
                     •
                  . 26. 28. doe eate bread, and therefore it remaineth breade after the wordes of consecration. For if it were transubstantiated into the bodye of Christ, then were there no Breade to eate, but the bodye of Christ is the thing that should be eaten: But none doe eate the verye bodye of Christ, For if euerie Communicant did eate the verie bodie of
