               ❧ TO THE RYGHTE
reuerende father in God, Iohn Bishoppe
of Sarum: Iohn Dolman,
his dayly oratour, wysheth continuaunce
of health, with encrease
of honour.
            
               RIght honourable: when
as, partly, by the counsel
of them that might commaund
me, and partlye,
by mine owne consent,
I left the vniuersity: and
began to apply my selfe to the studye of
the common lawes of this realme: I
felt my selfe chiefelye hindred therein,
with the entermedlīg of those studies,
the which, not without great delight,
I had afore time vsed. The whych, because
I was lothe to continue, to the
defrauding of the expectation of those,
with whom to trifle it had bene impietie:
I minded, to take my farewell of
some such part of philosophye, as, both
might be most profitable to the quiete
leading of my life, to whatsoeuer trade
I should giue my selfe: and also should

be so pleasaunt, that it might euen cloy
me with delight. Whiche my desyre to
satisfye, when I sought many bookes:
yet found I none more meete, thē this.
Which whiles I redde, I must needes
confesse, that I was neuer more delighted
with any worke, except it were
the sacred volume of the holye Scriptures.
Wherfore, when I had perused
it ouer, and founde suche profyte, and
pleasure therein, as it were not possible
to finde the like in anye Ethnike
wryter: I wyshed all men the lyke delyght,
as the reading of it brought vnto
me. And because I coulde not mysdoubt,
but the learned had already tried
into thintente, that the vnlearned
also, might haue some fruicion therof:
and, that our coūtrey, might at length
flowe with the workes of philosophye:
I endeuoured my selfe, althoughe not
eloquentlye, yet playnely, to translate
the same into our englishe tounge.
            And considering, that there was none
more meete, to haue the protection of
so graue and learned a worke, thē your
honour: remembring also, that the first

attempte, of the same parte of philosophye,
translated by maister Grimoald,
passed forth vnder the protectiō, of one
of that honourable vocation, to the
whiche also, it hath pleased god, after
sondry troubles, to call you: I thought
it my dutye, in respecte of manye benefites,
by your lordship on me bestowed,
to dedicate vnto you this my simple
trauayle. Thinking yt nothinge coulde
be vnwelcome to your honour, that sauoured
Tullie. Whom I am not ignoraunt,
howe much you were wonte to
esteeme. Wherfore, I hope, that, lykeas,
your lordshippe was wont to be delyghted
with the Romane Tullye: euē
so, this englishe Tullie (although not
adourned, with like eloquence by the
translator, yet varieng nothing in sēse)
you wil not disdayne. Knowynge, that
this simple scolers gyfte, contayneth
the signifyeng, of as hearty good will
towardes your honoure: as those greater
presentes to, whyche craue requyting.
Thus, lothe to trouble your lordshippe
any longer, wyth a vayne number
of wordes (because manye wordes

ofte cause many trippes) I commende
vnto your lordeshippe, the fauourable
iudgemente of this my simple trauayle:
to be perused, at such time,
as it shall seeme best, both for
your leasure and pleasure.
Written frō the inner
temple the .xiiii.

            The preface to the
Reader:
            
               IF thankefulnes, for so
simple desert, may cause
the to requite him, wyth
any part of the like gentlenes,
who toke vpon
him this trauayle (suche
as it is) onely for thy commoditie, gentle
reader: then staye a while, from the
reading of Tullie, and hearken fauourablie
to this litle cōmunication, that
I craue at thy handes. I minde onely,
to excuse my selfe briefeli vnto the, and
so, to dismisse the. The matters, which
I thinke, colourablie may, and will be
obiected vnto me, are these. Firste, the
lacke of yeares, and eloquence, to attempt
the translation of so weyghtye a
booke: as, the very sages of the vniuersitie,
haue let lye still, euen from the
time that it was first writtē, vnto this
daye. Then, the prophaning of the secretes
of Philosophy, whiche are esteemed
onelye of the learned, and neglected
of the multitude. And therfore, vnmeete,

to be made commen for euerye
man. First, as for mine owne vnablenes
for yeares, I aunswere, by Plato
and this mine authour: that I knowe
nothinge, but that, whiche my soule
nowe setled in my body, recounteth, as
thinges learned before. And the soule,
shal neuer haue the body more apte, to
whatsoeuer thinge it listeth to dispose
him, then in his youthe: whyche is, in
maner, the greenenesse of the same.
            Since therfore, the bodye, whych hath
no knoweledge, but by reason of the
soule, is in youth most apte and able to
execute the inuentions of the same:
what cause is there, whye the wit, beinge
one of the principall partes of the
soule, should not chiefelye in this nimblenes
of the bodye, vtter her force and
vertue? Then, as for lacke of eloquēce.
First, this (I thinke) they wil al graūt.
That, it is not possible for any man, to
expresse the writinges of Tullie, in
Englishe, so eloquently: as he hath vttered
the same in latine. Then, for
mine owne translation: forasmuche as
it must of necessity, be either more simple

then, the stile of Tullie, or els
more foolishe, and ful of croked termes
(for Tullies meane none can attaine)
I had rather to be partener of the fauour,
due to simplicity, and plainenes:
then, with foolyshe and farre fet wordes,
to make my translatiō seeme more
darke to the vnlearned, & more foolishe
to the wise. By which my playnenes,
withoute counterfaite eloquence, if I
haue gotten no other commoditye: yet,
thus muche I am sure of, that I haue
thereby escaped, the iust reproofe, that
they deserue, whiche thinke, to cloke
their ignoraunce, wyth inkehorne termes.
For, vnlesse it were in such thinges,
as the Lodgicians terme names
of arte, for the whych, we haue no proper
Englyshe words: I haue vsed none
but the playne and accustomed termes.
Now: as touching the second obiection,
which containeth the vnprofitable
disclosing of the miseries of lady
Philosophye (as mayster Grymoalde
termeth her) I thynke, that suffycientlye
satysfyed, yf they consyder, that besydes
the raskall multitude, and the

learned sages, there is a meane sort of
men: which although they be not learned,
yet, by the quicknes of their wits,
can conceiue al such poyntes of arte, as
nature coulde giue. To those, I saye,
there is nothing in this book to darke.
Especially, inasmuche as, the reading
of one booke, will open an other. And
thus, in my opinion, I am discharged
of vnprofitable reuealinge of the secretes
of philosophye. Inasmuche as,
both, I hope, it shall do muche good to
this sort of men, afore mencioned: and
also, I am sure, it can be nothing hurtful
to the learned. But shal much more
enflame, all liberall wittes, wyth the
desire of knoweledge: when they shall
see, so worthye matters, contayned in
one litle boke, of that, which we terme
philosophy or learning. Besides these,
there are yet other faultes, as the misprinting
of manye wordes, and the yll
printing of some greeke wordes, in latin
letters, & of the verses also, otherwyse
then they shoulde be red. But the
blame thereof I vtterlye refuse. Inasmuch
as, euerye man knoweth, that it

doth nothinge pertayne vnto me. Neuertheles,
as for the firste, whych contayneth
the misprintinge of wordes,
thou shalt finde them, all corrected, in
the ende of the booke. So that if thou
list to reade it, without desire of faulte
findinge: thou mayst firste, amende all
those faultes, with thy pen, in the margeant
of thy booke, whiche in the ende
of the booke be corrected. And so haue
the sense perfecte. And as for the two
last, they were caused by necessitie.
            The one for lacke of a Greeke letter,
and thother, for want of a smaller letter,
to print the verses in a lesse roame
And for other faultes, that maye be
found in my verses, I truste they wyll
pardon me, who may meruaile, howe,
so sodaynely I am become a versifier.
But, I beseche thee, (gentle reader) to
place eche mannes faulte by him selfe:
that I may be forced to father no other
mans faultes, then mine owne.
            Which, as I knowe to be more, then
I would they were: so I shall desire the
to weygh them with gentlenes.
            Knowynge, that if such, as haue greater

knoweledge, to set forthe thinges
more exactlye, should heare my plainenesse
not ouermuche discommended:
they then, should be much more prouoked,
wyth hope of the meruaylous
fame, that their doings should deserue
if they listed, to employe some paynes,
in attempting the like. Of the whych,
as I know there is a great number (in
both the vniuersities inespetially) so I
woulde wyshe, that eyther, they ceassyng
any longer, to enuie knoweledge
to our Englyshe tounge, would staine
the same, with better: or els, that they
woulde not disdaine, to forde their fauourable
wordes, to suche, as expresse
their good will in the same: althoughe
not so well as it might be, yet as theyr
eloquence will permit them. And thus
muche, to the learned reader, whom I
make the iudge of my worke, thoughe
I permit the reading of it, to all other.
But nowe, thou vnlearned reader: forasmuch
as, whatsoeuer I dyd, I dyd it
for the desyre, I had to profyte thee: it
shall be thy part, of the worst to thinke

the best. For, had it not bene for thy
commoditye, I could wel enough haue
suppressed mine ignoraunce wyth sylence:
and so, by concealinge that lytle
whyche I knowe: although not blased
my simple skil: yet, wel haue auoyded,
the necessitie of excuse, in such thynges
as I deserue reprehension. But so
muche I tendered thy profyte, that, I
had rather to saie somewhat (although
not so perfectly, as some other mighte)
then, for lacke of my litle labour, to let
so wor
                  •
               hy as booke, lye vnknowen vnto
the. Thus, whiles I studye to profyte
thee, I am fayne to submitte my
doynges, to the iudgemente, of euerye
curious carper. Wherefore, inasmuch
as, I haue brought the (who towardes
these thinges, wast no otherwise then
blind) by my trauaile, to the sight hereof:
and caused the, to be rid frō blindenes
(which is so lothsome a thing, that
it is almoste growen into a prouerbe,
that a blinde man, would be glad to se
his nighest felowe hanged, because the
he shoulde see (then trulye, thoughe I

craue no prayse at thy handes (because
it is a token of ignoraunce, to be praysed
of the ignorant) yet, I may be bold,
to desire so much of the, as Apelles cō
               maunded
the foolishe shoomaker, to

the picture of a man, drawen by Apelles,
so liuelye, that the senses of man
would haue doubted, whether it were
a picture, or a liuing creature: not contented,
wyth the syghte of it, whyche
was more meete for a prince to behold
then him: began, to finde faulte with
his showe. Apelles, knowynge that he
was a shomaker, toke it in good part:
& wyth the pensile, amended the fault.
But the shoemaker by likelihood, sum
what proud, that he was able, to finde
faulte wyth Apelles workes: came agayne
the seconde daye. And, began to
disprayse the proportion of his face.
            Wherewithall, Apelles being muche
moued, stept forth, and sayde. No farther
then thy shoe, sowter. Shewynge
thereby, that no man oughte to talke
farther, then his skill will beare him.

prince, whiles he, stoode in his scoole,

began to talke of thinges whyche he

an ende, and to sende the to Tullye.
            Do thou, neyther praise, nor disprayse,
farther then thy conning wil beare the
For, they are both alike faultes. But
rightly weyghe, and remember the
wordes of Tullie, to whom, I
now send the, to enioy such
pleasure, as at the fyrste,

            THE FIRST BOOKE
of the report of those Questions
which Marke Tullye Cicero
disputed in his manor of Tusculanū:
treatinge whether death be
euell yea or no.
            
               
                  BEING OF LATE
wholy (or els for the
most part) ridden of
my causes of Plea,
and Parlyamente
matters (deare frēd
Brute) I referred
my selfe (chiefly by
your councell) to those studyes: whyche
concealed in my minde, suspended for a
seasō, and for a long space discontinued
I haue nowe reuiued. And forasmuche
as the right trade and order of all those
artes whych pertayne to the framinge
of a perfect life, is conteyned in the studye
of wisedome, which is named philosophye:
I thoughte good to endite the
same in the Latine tounge: not for that
I thought it could not be so wel vnderstoode,
either in the Greeke, or by the

teachers of the same language: but because
my iudgemente hathe bene euer
such, that our countreymen haue either
inuented and founde out thinges, more
wisely then the Greekes: or at the least
that suche as they had taken of theym
they had made farre more perfect: especially
if the thinges were suche, as they
estemed worthy theyr trauaile and paynes.
For in maners, orders of liuinge,
and maynteyning of householde: We
truly behaue our selues both farre better
than they, and also more liberall.
            And as for the comen wealth, our forefathers
haue gouerned it, with muche
more politike orders and lawes.
            What should I saye of warfare? in the
which our countreymen passed truly in
manhode, but much more in pollecy.
            But as for the giftes of Nature, and
such thinges as they might attaine vnto
without learning: neyther the Greekes,
neyther yet any other nation, may
well be compared with them. For,
what so greate grauitye? what so
notable constancye? stoutenesse of stomake,

honestye? or truste, what so passinge
vertue in all kynde of poyntes,
hath bene found in any nation? that it
maye for the same be compared with
oure auncesters? In learninge and all
kyndes of profound knoweledge.
            Greece passed vs. Howebe it trulye it
was a light worke to excell vs in those
thinges, in the whyche we did not contend
wyth them.
            For where as the Greekes haue had
amonges thē the most aunciēt Poetes
that euer were counted learned (for
Homer and Hesiodus lyued afore the
buylding of Rome: and Archilocus in
the time of Romulus) we knewe not
Poetrye till of late yeares.
            For foure hundred and ten yeares after
the buyldinge of Rome, Liuius set
forth an enterlude.
            Caius Claudius, the sonne of Cecus,
and Marcus Tuditanus beynge Consuls:
the yeare nexte afore the byrthe of
Ennius, whyche was more aunciente
then Plautus or Neuius. Of late
yeares therefore Poetes were of oure

countreymen both knowen & receyued.
Albeit we find in those histories, which
were written in the firste foundation
of our city, that at that time, they were
wont in bankets to singe certayne songes,
made of the noble prowes of valiaunt
men. But that such men were neuer
in any estimation, we may wel gather
by the oration of Cato, in the whiche
he obiected it as a rebuke to Marcus
Nobilior, that he had taken wyth
him Poetes into his prouince. For he
had led into Aetolia the poete Ennius:
as we al wel knowe. The lesse therfore
that poetes were estemed, the lesse men
coueted theyr knowledge: and yet those
fewe that gaue thē selues thereto, were
nothinge inferioure to the renowne of
the Greekes. Lykewyse, if it had bene
counted a quality prayseworthy (in Fabius
a moo
                  ••
                noble Prince) to paynte:
should not we haue had in our citie, as
excellent in that science (thinke you) as
euer was Policletus or Parrhasius?
            Honour bredeth artes, and all men are
prouoked to studye by fame: & alwayes
those thinges are neglected, whiche no

man sets by. The Greekes thoughte
there was great conninge and knoweledge
in singinge: as well to the instrumentes,
as alone: & for that cause Epaminundas
(in my iudgement) the prince
of Grece) is reported to haue bene conning
in singinge to the instrumentes:
and Themistocles a fewe yeres before,
for that in a certayne banket he refused
the harpe, was counted the worse learned.
Therfore in Greece Musiciās flourished:
and euerye man learned theyr
arte: neyther could any be counted wel
learned being ignoraunt of the same.
            Geometrye was in greate estimacion
emonges theym. For the whiche cause
there was nothing with them more famous,
then the Mathematicalles. But
we haue cōprised the arte of Geometry
in the knowledge of measures & reasōs
of the same. But cōtrarywise, a perfect
orator we haue quickly poolished: whō
at ye first we had not learned, but onely
meete to pleade: but now neuerthelesse
wel learned. For we vnderstand yt Galba,
Africanus, & Lelius were profound
men: and he who farre passed theym in

age, namely Cato, very studious: after
him Lepidus, Car
                  •
               o, and bothe the
Gracchi: but afterward so many and so
notable mē, euen to this our time, that
herein, eyther not much, or els nothing
at all, we yelded to the Greekes. Philosophy
hath bene neglected vnto this
our age: and hath bene hitherto voyde
of the light of the latine tounge: which
now must be opened, and reuiued of vs
to thintent, that if in our businesse, we
haue somwhat profyted our countrey,
we maye also do the like by some meanes
in this our time of leasure: wherein
also we ought to take the more paynes,
because there are certayne Latine
bookes written nowe a dayes very vnaduisedlye:
sette forthe by men honest
enough, but not sufficiently learned.
            Truly it maye well be, that some man
maye inuente well, and neuerthelesse,
that which he hathe inuented, can not
pr
                  •
               nounce eloquentlye: but that anye
man should set abrode his owne inuentions,
which he can neither wel dispose
neyther hansomly penne, the readynge
of the whyche should nothing at all delighte

the hearer: it is the poynt of such
a one, as abuseth both leasure and learninge.
Therfore, theyr owne bookes
they reade with such, as they them selues
are: neyther doth anye man handle
them, except suche, as would haue the
selfe same libertye in writinge graunted
them. Wherfore, if we broughte
any helpe by our laboures, to the praise
of Oratours, we will much more dylygently
open the fountaynes of Philosophye:
out of the which neuerthelesse,
those oure workes of Rethorique dyd
flowe. But as Arystotle, a man of wonderful
witte, and profound knowledge,
moued wyth the greate fame and reporte
of Isocrates the Rhetorician, began
bothe to pleade, and also to teache
yong men: and so to ioyne knoweledge
with eloquence: euen so it likes me, neyther
to lay apart mine old study of pleading,
and yet neuerthelesse, to be occupied
in this more noble & plentifull art.
For I haue euer iudged that to be perfect
Philosophy, which could reason of
weighty matters, as well with great
knowledge as also wt perfect eloquence

In the which kind of exercise I haue so
earnestly laboured my selfe, that nowe
I durst kepe scooles after the maner of
the Greekes. As of late after your departure,
in my manor of Tusculanum,
beinge accompanied with many of my
familier frēdes, I assayed what I could
do in that maner of reasoninge. For as
afore I declamed causes, so this is my
declaming in mine old age. I willed any
man to propose whatsoeuer he listed
to heare debated: and thereof I disputed
eyther sittinge or walkynge. Therfore
my disputacions in scooles holden fyue
dayes together, I haue endyted in as
many bookes. The order thereof was
this. That when he who woulde heare
anye matter discussed, had shewed his
owne opiniō of the same, then I should
hold the contrarye. For this is (as you
knowe ryght well) the auncient waye,
fyrste vsed by Socrates, to dispute agaynst
all mens opinions. For so he
thoughte, that whatsoeuer was moste
true in anye matter, might soonest be
boulted out. But to the intent you may
more playnely perceyue our reasons, I

wyll wryte them as if the matter were
doing, not telling, therefore nowe take
you the beginning in this maner.

               To thē do you meane
whych are dead, or els that must dye?
            
            
               Hea.
               To them both.
            
            
               Mar.
               It is miserable
then, if it be euell.
            
            
               Hea.
               Yea truly.
            
            
               Mar.
               Then all they whych are already
deade, and all such as must dye, are miserable.
            
            
               Hea.
               So I thinke.
            
            
               Mar.
               There
is no man then which is not miserable
            
            
               Hea.
               None truly.
            
            
               Mar.
               And trulye if
you wil in all poyntes firmely hold this
opinion, all men whiche are borne, or
shalbe borne, are not onelye wretched
but also for euer wretched. For if you
did onely call thē wretches which must
dye, then should you except none of thē
whyche nowe liue: for we must all dye:
but neuerthelesse, the end of our misery
should be in deathe: but forasmuche as
such as are dead also are wretched, we
are borne to continuall miserye. For it
must nedes be that they are wretched,
which an hundred yeares past are dead:

or rather all they, whych at anye tyme
heretofore were borne.
            
            
               Hea.
               So I
thinke certaynelye.
            
            
               Mar.
               Tell me (I
praye you) do these thinges feare you?
the thre headed Cerberus in hell? the
noyse of Cocytus? the rowinge ouer
Acheron? Tantalus nye sterued for
thirst, touching the brimmes of the water
with his chinne? or this els? that
Sysyphus turnes the tombling stone,
and vayles not of a ioate. Perchaunce
also the rigorous iudges, Minos, and
Radamanthus, afore the whiche, neyther
Lucius Crassus, ne yet Marcus
Antonius shall defend you, neyther (because
afore Greeke iudges your cause
shall be pleaded) Demosthenes can do
you any seruice: you your selfe, must in
a wonderfull assemblye pleade youre
owne cause. These thinges perchaunce
you feare, and therfore thinke death to
be the greatest euell that may be.
            
            
               Hea.
               Thinke you that I am so madde
that I woulde beleue these tales?
            
            
               Mar.
               Why? do you not credite them?
            
            
               Hea.
               No truly.
            
            
               Mar.
               You tel an yll
tale for your selfe.
            
            
               Hea.
               Why so?
            
            
               
               Mar.
               Because he had neede to be eloquente
that shoulde assaye to dysproue
these thynges.
            
            
               Hea.
               Who coulde not
lyghtlye be eloquente in suche a cause?
or what busynes is it, to confute these
monsters of Poetes and Paynters?
            
            
               Marcus.
               Yet neuerthelesse, you shall
reade the bookes of philosophers, verye
full of reasons, agaynst the sayd tales.
            
            
               Hearer.
               Folyshelye enough I assure
you. For who would be so madde, as
to be moued wyth them?
            
            
               Marcus.
               Wel, if there be none wretched
in hell, neyther be there anye in
hell.
            
            
               Hearer.
               So I thynke.
            
            
               Marcus.
               Where then are those whō
you cal wretches? or what place do they
inhabite? for if they be they must nedes
be in some certayne place.
            
            
               Hea.
               I truly
thinke they be no where.
            
            
               Mar.
               Then
you thinke that they are not at all.
            
            
               Hea.
               Euen so, and yet neuerthelesse,
that they be wretches, because they be
not.
            
            
               Marcus.
               I had rather that you
sayd it for feare of Cerberus, then that
you shoulde haue broughte suche an
vnwittye reason.
            
            
               Hearer.
               Why so?
            
            
               
               Mar.
               Whom you saye not to be, he you
say afterwardes is: where is your wit?
when you saye that they are wretched,
then you saye that they whiche are not
are.
            
            
               Hea.
               I am not so blunt witted,
that I would so saye.
            
            
               Mar.
               What saye
you then.
            
            
               Hea.
               For example, I say that
Marcus Crassus is wretched, for that
he was caused bi death to leaue so great
ryches, that Cneius Pompeye also is
wretched, whom deathe depryued of so
great glory and honour: to conclude, I
saye that all those are wretches, whych
lacke the fruicion of this pleasaūt light.
            
            
               Mar.
               You come to the same poynte, for
they must nedes be, if thei be wretches.
But you euen now did denie, that those
are which be deade: if they be not therefore,
they can be nothinge: and by that
meanes neither can they be wretches.
            
            
               Hea.
               Perchaunce I haue not tolde you
all that I thinke: for not to be whē you
haue bene, I thinke is the greatest misery
that may be.
            
            
               Mar.
               Nay by that reasō
what can be more wretched then not to
haue bene at all? and so those which are
not yet borne, because they be not, are

miserable: and we oure selues, if after
our death we shall be miserable, were
miserable also afore we were borne.
But I sureli for my part, am not remē
                  bred,
that I was a wretche afore I was
borne. Yf your remembraunce be anye
surer, I would fayne knowe yf you remember
any such thing of your selfe.
            
            
               Hea.
               You boord with me, as though I
should say, that those are wretches whiche
are vnborne, and not those whych
be dead.
            
            
               Mar.
               You graunt therfore that
they be.
            
            
               Hea.
               Nay because they be not
as they haue bene, therfore I saye they
be wretched.
            
            
               Mar.
               Perceyue you not
that you speake contraries? for what
maye be so contrarye, as to saye, that he
which is not, not onelye is, but also is
a wretche: Do you, goinge out at the
gate called Capena, when you see the
tombes of both the Calatines, the Scipions,
the Seruilians, and the Metellans,
thinke that they be wretched?
            
            
               Hea.
               Because you vrge me so muche
with the word, I wil no more saye that
they be wretches, but onely wretches,
for that very cause, because they be not
            
            
               
               Mar.
               Then you say not Marcus Crassus
is a wretche. But onelye Marcus
Crassus wretche.
            
            
               Hea.
               Euen so.
            
            
               Mar.
               As though whatsoeuer you do so
pronounce must not either be or not be.
A
                     •
                  e you nothing skilfull in Logike?
               Emonges the verye principles of that
arte, this is taughte. That euery proposition
(for so it semes good to me, to
interprete the Greeke worde, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
I wil vse hereafter a more mete terme,
yf I chaunce to happē on any) is eyther
true or false. Wherfore, when you say
Marcus Crassus wretche, eyther you
say this in effect, Marcus Crassus is a
wretche, that men may iudge whether
it be true or false, or els you saye nothing
at all.
            
            
               Hea.
               Well now I graunt
you, that they are not wretches whiche
are deade, because you forced me to
graunt, that such as were not could not
be wretches. But what saye you to
this? We which liue, forasmuch as we
must nedes dye, are not we wretches?
For what pleasure may we take in our
life time, when daye and nyghte we
must alwayes thinke, that we shall by

and by dye.
            
            
               Marcus.
               Understand you
then, by this your graūt, of how much
misery you haue relyeued mankynd?
            
            
               Hearer.
               How so?
            
            
               Mar.
               Because, if
deathe were miserable to suche as are
deade, then we should haue a continual
and euerlasting misery. But nowe I se
the ende of our race: to the which when
we haue once runne, there is nothyng
more that we ought to feare. But you
(as farre as I can perceyue) folowe
the opinyon of Epicharmus the Sicilian,
a man quycke witted, and not
wholye voyde of learninge.
            
            
               Hearer.
               What was his opinion? for
I knowe it not.
            
            
               Marcus.
               I wil shewe
you if (I can) in Latine: for you knowe,
that I do no more vse to speake Greeke
in my Latine talke, then Latine in my
Greeke.
            
            
               Hea.
               You do well in that.
But I pray you, what was the opiniō
of Epicharmus?
            
            
               Mar.
               I woulde not
dye: but to be deade, I would not much
passe.
            
            
               Hea.
               Now I remēber the Greke
very well. And inasmuche as you haue
constrayned me to graunte, that such
as are deade, are not wretched: bringe

to passe also (yf you can) that to dye I
may thinke no misery.
            
            
               Hea.
               Surely
that is but a smal matter. But I am about
thinges of more weyght.
            
            
               Hea.
               Howe is this but a small matter? or
what are those more weyghty matters
that you entende to bringe to passe?
            
            
               Mar.
               Because, if after deathe, there is
no euell, neither trulye is death it selfe
euell: the next time to the whiche, is
the time after death, in the whych you
graunt there is no euel. So to die truly
is no euell, because it is but a leadinge
and an entraunce to that whyche is no
euell.
            
            
               Hea.
               I pray you, let these thinges
be more plainely opened. For these
darke reasons, make me sooner to confesse
the thing that you desyre, then to
agree to it. But I praye you, what are
those greater thynges whych you mind
to do?
            
            
               Mar.
               To teache (if I can) that
death is not onelye no euell, but also a
good thing.
            
            
               Hea.
               I do not necessarily
requyre so much: but I greatlye desyre
to heare it. For albeit you bryng not to
passe, that whiche you minde, yet you
shall surely perswade me, that death is

no euell. But I will not trouble you in
your talke, I had rather heare you
speake alone.
            
            
               Mar.
               What if I shall
aske you any thinge? will you not aunswere
me?
            
            
               Hea.
               Then I might be counted
verye statelye. But except you had
nede, I woulde rather you shoulde not
also.
            
            
               Mar.
               I am contented to folowe
your minde therein. And those thynges
which you willed me to shewe, as well
as I can, I will declare. Neuerthelesse
I would not, you should take my wordes,
as the Oracles of the god Apollo.
Or to thinke that whatsoeuer I shall
speake is sure and certayne: but as the
sayenges of some simple man, foloweinge
that whiche is probable by coniecture.
For farder then likelyhoode I can
not go. It is enough for theym, to tell
certayne and sure thinges, which saye
that such thinges may be knowen: and
also professe them selues to be wyse.
            
            
               Hea.
               Kepe you what order you please:
I am ready to heare you.
            
            
               Mar.
               Death
it selfe, which euery man semes so well
to knowe, we must fyrst see what it is.
For some thinke that it is the deparparting

of the soule from the body.
               There be other some, whiche thinke
there is no departure, but that the bodye
and soule do dye together. But of
them, which thinke that the soule doth
departe, some saye that he is strayght-wayes
scattered: other thinke that he
remayneth longe: some for euer. But
what the soule is, or where, or frome
whence, there is great dissensiō. Some
thinke the hearte to be the soule: of the
which, some men are called faynt hearted,
madde hearted, and ioyned wyth
heartes in frendshippe. And the wyse
Nasica, who was twise Consull, was
called a litle heart: and
A stoute harted man Catus Aelius
the syxt.
               
               Empedocles thinketh the soule to be a
certayne bloud about the heart. Other
some, take a certayne part of the braine
to be the soule. Other like none of these
opinions: but place the soule, partelye
in the heart, and partly in the brayne.
               And againe, the soule some men thinke
to be the life: as oure countreymen call
it. For we commonlye saye, to laboure

for lyfe: to ende his life: and to be longe
lyued. But to Zeno the Stoyke, the
soule seemes to be fier. And these opinions
whiche we haue recyted, of the
hearte, brayne, lyfe, and fyer, are commonlye
reported. But euerye pryuate
man hath other inuentions: As manye
auncyente Philosophers afore tyme,
and of late, Arist
                     •
                  xenus a Musicyan,
and a Philosopher lykewyse, sayd that
it was a certayne consonaunce of the
bodye, like as we see in certaine songes
and instrumentes a certayne pleasaunt
concente and agreemente, euen so that
in the nature and shape of the whole
bodye, there were diuers motions stirred:
as in songes soundes and noyses.
               He lefte not his arte: and yet he sayde
somewhat: whyche verye thynge was
afore opened, and declared by Plato.
               Xenocrates denyed, that the soule had
anye shape or bodye: sayeng that it was
a thinge consysting onely of members:
the power of yt whiche (as Pythagoras
had afore time declared (is of no small
force, in the constitucion of mans body.

His mayster Plato deuided the soule in
to thre partes. The chiefe of the which
(namely reason) he placed in the heade
as in a forte: from whiche he seperated
the two other partes: namelye angre &
desyre: whiche he placed in diuers roames.
Anger in the brest, and desyre vnder
those places whiche are aboute the
hearte. But Dicearchus, in his bookes
whiche he wrytes of the reasonynge of
learned men kepte at Corinthe, in the
fyrst bringes in manye speakers: in the
other two he bringeth in a certayne old
man of Phthios, (whō he calleth Pherecrates,
& sayes that he came of Deucalion
(reasoninge that the soule is nothing.
And that it is but a vaine name,
neither thinketh he, that there is either
minde or soule, in man or beast, otherwise
then a certayne motion, by the
whyche we both do and suffer, spred in
all liuing creatures alike. Neyther wil
he that it should be anye other thynge,
thē the body so shaped, that by the force
of Nature, it may haue life and sense.
               Aristotle who farre passed all the reste
in wyt and diligence, (alwayes exceptinge

Plato) after he hadde treated of
those foure kind of principles, out of the
which al thinges take their beginning:
thought that there was a certayne fift
nature, of the whiche the soule & minde
did consist. For to thinke, to foresee, to
learne, to teache, to inuente, and diuers
such other propertyes, as to remember,
to loue, to hate, to desyre, to feare, to be
vexed, to be mery: these and suche like,
he thought were in none of these foure
kynd of causes. Therfore he addeth to
them the fyft kynde, without anye propre
name, and calleth the soule & mind,
by a newe name 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , whiche
signifieth a certayne continuall and euerlasting
motion. Except perchaunce
a fewe, whiche I remember not: these
are the opinions of al the philosophers,
touchinge the soule. For as for Democrytus,
a worthye man, but yet compounding
the soule of the chaungeable
meetinge of certayne lighte, round and
indiuisible bodyes, we will nowe ouerpasse.
For there is nothinge whiche a
company of Butterflyes wil not lightlye
make with him. Of all these opinions

whiche is moste true, let some god
iudge: but whiche is moste likely to be
true, there is great doubte. Whether
wil you therfore, that we trye oute the
truest of them? or els that we retourne
to our purpose?
            
            
               Hea.
               I woulde verye
fayne heare both: if it might be. But it
were very hard to confound them togither.
Wherfore, if wythoute the searching
of these opinions, we may be deliuered
from the feare of deathe, I pray
you do that whych we haue in hande:
if not, do that nowe, and this at some
other time.
            
            
               Mar.
               That whiche I perceiue
you would rather haue done, that
also I thinke, is more commodious.
               For whych soeuer of those opinions be
true, I shall lightlye perswade you by
reason, that deathe is not euell but rather
good. For if the hearte, bloude, or
brayne be the soule, trulye, because eyther
of them is a bodie, it shal dye with
the rest of the bodye. If it beaer, it shall
be dispersed: if it be fyre it shall be quenched:
if it be Aristoxenus musicall concent,
it shalbe dissolued. What shall I
saye of Dicearchus? who sayeth that
the soule is nothing at all. By all these

opinions there can nothing after death
pertayne to anye man. For euen with
our life our sense is lost: and he that feeleth
nothinge, neede not to passe, what
chaunce betides him. Yet the opinions
of y• other Philosophers, put vs in good
hope (if that delight you) that our soules
may after this life passe into the heuens,
as a place appoynted for them.
            
            
               Hea.
               Truly it delyghteth me greatlye.
And assuredly, y• it so is, I wil alwayes
perswade my selfe.
            
            
               Mar.
               What nede
you in this case, to requyre my labour?
am I able in eloquence to excell Plato?
reade diligently that booke, whyche he
wrote of the soule: so shal you lacke nothinge,
concerninge the knoweledge of
this questiō.
            
            
               Hea.
               I haue done so truly,
yea and that very often. But (I knowe
not how) whiles I reade him, I am fully
perswaded. But after I haue layd asyde
the booke, & begin to thinke with
my selfe, of the immortality of our soules,
all my perswasion sodaynelye slips
away.
            
            
               Mar.
               Wel sir, graunte you that
the soules abyde after death? or els saye
you that they dye with the reste of the
body?
            
            
               Hea.
               I graunt that thei remaine.
            
            
               
               Mar.
               What if they remayne?
            
            
               Hea.
               I
graunt they be blessed.
            
            
               Mar.
               What if
they dye?
            
            
               Hea.
               Then they be not wretched,
because they be not. For that being
therunto costrayned by you I haue
already graunted.
            
            
               Mar.
               How then? or
for what cause? do you saye that deathe
is euell? which eyther shal make vs happy,
our soules remayninge, or els not
wretched our sense beinge paste.
            
            
               Hea.
               Shewe therfore fyrste (vnlesse it
be to paynefull for you) that our soules
remayne after this life. But yf you can
not proue that (for it is very harde) you
shall shewe, that there is no harme in
death. For I feare muche leaste it be a
griefe (I do not meane to lacke sense)
but that I must lacke sense.
            
            
               Mar.
               To
proue this matter which you desyre, we
may vse as good authoures as may be:
which in all causes both ought and also
is wont to be of great importaunce:
and fyrst we may confyrme it by all antiquity:
which, the nigher it was to the
beginning of the worlde, and progenye
of the gods, so much the better (peraduenture)
did see those thinges, whyche

were true. For emonges those auncyent
fathers, (whō Ennius calleth Cascos)
this one thinge was comen: that
there is in death feling: and that a man
by departing of his life, is not so vtterly
extinguished, that he should altogether
peryshe. And this may you gather,
both by many other thinges, but chiefly,
by the lawe of the byshops, and ceremonies
of burials: whiche they beynge
most wittye men, would neyther, with
so great care haue obserued, neither yet
being irreuerently or vnhonestly vsed,
would so sharpely haue punished: except
this had bene faste fixed in theyr mindes,
that death is no destruction vtterly
marring and blemishing al thinges,
but onelye a certayne departure and
chaunge of lyfe: the whiche to worthye
men, & women, is wont to be a guyde
into heauen: and vicious and il disposed
persons, did cause to tary on the groūd:
and neuerthelesse to remayne stil. By
this opinion also, and by the iudgemēt
of our countreymen.
Romulus in heauens with gods doth
passe his time.
               
               
                  As Ennius the Poete, agreeing to comen
fame, hath writen. And frō thence
flyeng to vs, and so to the West Occeane,
Hercules is counted so great, and
so mightye a god. For this cause Bacchus,
the sonne of Semele, is so muche
reported. And in like maner famous
were the .ii. sonnes of Tindareus, who
not onely in field were helpers of victory
to the Romans, but also messengers
of the same. Also Ino, the doughter of
Cadmus, is she not of the Greekes by
the name of Leucothea, and of our countreymen
by the name of Matuta worshipped?
What? the whole heauen (to
thintent I make no longer discourse) is
it not replenished with mankinde? for
if I should assaye to searche auncyente
monumentes, and put in writing, such
thinges as be in olde Greeke bookes:
thē should you wel perceyue, that such,
as we count to be the greatest goddes,
haue departed out of ye earth, into those
places of heauen. But ignoraunt men
that knewe not naturall philosophye,
whych of late came into vse, perswaded
them selues so much, as they could gather

by naturall reason. The order and
causes of thinges they knewe not.
               They were oftē moued by visions (and
those chiefelye in the nighte) to thinke,
that such as were dead, did liue againe.
Wherfore, like as we se it a very strōg
argumēt to beleue that there are gods:
because there is no nation so cruel, neyther
yet anye man so beastlye: in whose
mind there is not fixed some opinion of
God. (Many neuerthelesse haue conceaued
diuers foolishe fancies of the gods)
but yet they graunte all that there is a
diuine power and nature. Neyther yet,
doth the communication or agreement
of men, cause this consent, the opinion
is cōfirmed by no decrees, by no lawes:
but in euery thing, the argement of all
nations is taken for the law of nature:
So likewise, in asmuch as all nations,
haue worshipped their benefactors as
gods after theyr death (although some
more foolyshe then other it is euident,
that nature hath engraffed in the heartes
of all men, a natural opinion without
perswasiō, that our soules are immortall,
and remayne after this life.
               
                  But who is there, that would not bewayle
the death of his friend? when he
thinkes, that he is depriued the commodities
of this life. Take away his fansye,
and you shall take awaye all mourning.
For no man mourneth, but for
his discommodity. For we sorowe, and
are vexed, and all our wofull lamentation,
and sad mourning, ryseth hereof,
that him whom so entirelye we loued,
we suppose to lacke the commodities of
this life, and that to feele. And these
thinges we ymagine, onely by the conducting
of nature, wythout eyther reason
or learninge. And hereof we wyll
talke hereafter. But the greatest argument,
by the whych we may gather,
that nature it selfe, doth priuily thinke
of the immortality of our soules, is that
moste wise men, take greatest care for
thinges to come after their death.
               Some one sets trees, whiche may profyte
in an other age (as Statius sayeth
in his bookes entituled Synephebi
to what other ende? but for that he
knewe, that the time to come did also
pertayne vnto him? for the same cause,

diuers diligente husbandemen graffe
trees, whose encrease they shall neuer
see. And likewyse, manye noble men
make lawes, orders, and customes, the
obseruatiōs of the which, they shall neuer
beholde. What? the begettinge of
children? the spreading of fame? the adoptions
of children? the diligent obseruinge
of testamentes? the very monumentes,
& Epitaphes of graues? what
other thing do they signify? then that,
we haue al a respect to ye time to come?
Besydes this. There is no doubte, but
the tryall of nature, oughte to be taken
of the best nature. But what mens nature
is better thē theyrs, which thinke
theym selues borne, to helpe, saue, and
comfort men? Hercules is departed frō
hence to the gods. To them he shoulde
neuer haue gone, vnlesse whiles he
was emonges men, he had prepared
him selfe a way thither. But these are
old matters: and nowe also sanctifyed
by religion. What shall we thinke, of
so manye, and so notable men, in thys
our comen wealth, whiche willinglye
toke theyr deathe, for theyr countreyes

sake? Did they (think you) suppose? that
their memorye shoulde be extended no
lenger then the terme of theyr lyfe?
               Trulye, no man at anye time was so
madde, as without hope of immortalitie,
to offer him selfe to deathe for his
countrey. For otherwise, it had bene
lawefull for Themistocles: to haue lyued
in ease, it had bene lawefull for Epaminundas:
It had bene also (that we
enquire no farder of old and forren matters)
lawfull for me. But (I knowe not
howe) there sticketh in mens mindes, a
certayne gesse of life to come: yea, and
that doth most commōly happen, in the
most stoute and harty courages, and in
them appeares most lightlye. Whiche
hope taken away, who is there so mad,
that would continually liue in laboure
and daunger? and hitherto we haue spokē
of princes. But do we not se the like
of Poetes? will not they be remembred
after theyr death? Uppon what cause
then, was this writen?

                     Behold ye Citisens here the shape of
Ennius image old.
                     Who hathe descriued youre fathers

factes & eke their gestes hath told.
                  
               
               Lo, he requireth the report of fame, and
renowne at theyr handes, whose forefathers
he had caused by his writynge
to be famous. And the same Ennius,
wryteth in another place thus.

                     Let no man me bemoane, nor wayle
me when I dye.
                     For whye? aliue my good reporte in
mouthes of men shal flye.
                  
               
               But what doubte we of Poetes? yea,
suche as liue by handcraftes, desyre after
death to be remembred. For what
other cause dydde Phydias, graue hys
shape in the tergat of Minerua? where
it was not lawefull for him to wryte?
What? the Philosophers thēselues, do
they not in those bookes whych they
write of the despising of glory, imprint
their owne names? Certes, if the consent
of all men be the voice of nature, &
al men in al places do agree, that there
is some thing, that doth pertaine to thē
which are departed out of this life: we
also must nedes thīke ye same. And since
we know, ye they whose mind passeth either
in wit or vertue (because their wit

is best) do se most clearely the power of
nature. It is most likely, forasmuch as
euery good man taketh care for his posterity,
that he supposeth that there is
some thing, the sense and feeling of the
which, he shal haue after death. But
as we knowe by nature that there be
gods: But what they be, we gather by
wyt and reason: so we thinke because
of the consent and agrement of all nations,
that our soules do remayne after
death. But in what place they be,
or what maner thinges they are, we
must gather by reason. The ignoraūce
of the whiche, hath fayned and inuented
hell and such terroures, as you seemed
somewhat afore not without iuste
cause to despyse. For our bodyes being
layd in the grounde, and couered wyth
earth (whereof also suche as are buryed
are sayd to be earthed) they thought the
reste of our life should be led vnder the
ground. Which opinion hath bene the
cause of great errours: Whyche haue
bene augmented and encreased by Poetes.
For the thicke companye of the
Theater, in the which there are many

women and children, is muche moued
hearing so terrible a verse as this.

                     I here am come from hell, by wayes
full hye and steepe.
                     By dennes ybuylte with stoanes, by
caues ful darke and deepe.
                     Where lothly darknes dwels, where
cralling furies creepe.
                  
               
               Yea and that errour was of such force,
(which nowe I truste is nye extinguished)
that whereas they sawe, mennes
bodyes burne afore: yet neuerthelesse,
they would fayne them doing such thinges
in hell, as withoute bodyes, coulde
neyther be done in deede, neyther yet
ymagined. For they could not wel conceyue,
howe the soule might liue withoute
the bodye: and for that cause, they
ymagined that they liued vnder some
certayne shape and figure. Uppon this
occasion, Homere wrote his booke
whiche he entituled 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . Hereof
spronge that Necromancie, whiche my
friende Appius was wont to use. For
this cause also, was the lake that standeth
not farre from mi house, called the
lake of hell.

                     
                     Whence soules are stireed vp, in darke
and grisely shapes.
                     Whyche when hell gates are opened
once, out at the doores escapes.
                  
               
               Yet neuerthelesse, these shapes and shadowes
they fayne to speake. Whyche
can not be wythout the tounge iawes,
sydes, and lyghtes. For they conceyued
very litle in theyr mindes: but referred
all to theyr bodelye eyes. But it is a
great point of wyt, for a man to reuoke
his minde, from the iudgement of his
outward senses, and to withdrawe the
consent of his thoughtes, from thinges
that haue bene alowed by custome.
               And I beleue trulye, that there haue
bene manye other, whiche in all ages
haue reasoned of the immortalitye of
the soules. But of those whyche haue
left any writinges behinde them, Pherecides,
a Sirian taught firste, that the
soules of men were euerlasting. A man
surely of great antiquitye. For he liued
in the time of my kinsman Tullus Hostilius.
This opinion, his scoler Pythagoras
did chiefely confyrme, who when
he came into Italye, in the raygne of

Tarquinius the proude, amased all
great Greece, with his estimation, learning,
and authoritye. Yea, and manye
yeares after the name of the Pythagoreans
was so highely esteemed, that in
comparyson of them, no other Philosophers
seemed to be learned. But let vs
retourne to those aunciente Philosophers.
Commenly they would geue no
reason of anye thinge, that they spake
vnlesse it were same such thing, as they
should declare by numbers or descriptions.
It is sayde that Plato, to thintent
that he myghte knowe the Pythagoreans,
came into Italye: and there
was acquaynted both with manye other,
but chyefelye wyth Archytas and
Timeus, of whome he learned all the
opinion of Pithagoras: and that at the
fyrst, he not onelye thought as Pythagoras
did, as concerninge the eternitye
of the soule, but also confyrmed the
same wyth reason. Whych (vnlesse you
be otherwyse minded) let vs ouerpasse,
and leaue of all this reasonynge of the
immortalytye of the soules.
            
            
               
               He.
               What wil you now leaue me, wh
                     •
                  
you haue broughte me into so great expectacion?
I had rather to erre wyth
Plato (whom I knowe howe much you
esteeme, and I wonder at the more, because
of your prayse) then to thinke wel
wyth other.
            
            
               Mar.
               Worthelye spoken.
For I my selfe assuredly, would not be
aggrieued to erre with him. And is
there anye doubte, but that as he hathe
handled al other thinges very learnedlie
and profoundly, so he hath done this
also? although this hathe leaste nede of
cunning handeling. For the Mathematicians
do well proue it sayeng, that
the earthe, whiche is placed in the middest
of the world, in comparison of the
whole heauen, hath but the proportion
of a small poynt, whych they call a centre.
And such is the nature of those four
bodyes, of the whyche all thinges take
theyr beginning, that they haue equallye
diuided motions. So that all earthly
and watery bodyes, do naturally fall
downe into the earth and sea, and all other,
namelye fierye and aerye, lyke as
the fyrste .ii. because of the heauines of

theyr weyghte do tende to the middest
place of the world, so these by righte lynes
flye vpwardes into the heauenlye
region: eyther because they them selues
naturallye do moue vpwardes, or els,
because they being light bodyes, are by
force dryuen from the other whiche are
grosse and heauy. Whiche sayenges,
forasmuch as they are certayne, it must
nedes folowe, that our soules, whē thei
are departed from oure bodies, yf they
be of fyerye or aery nature, must of necessitie
ascende into the higher regions.
But if the soule be some number (whiche
was spoken more wittelye then
playnely) or if it be that fifte principle,
(as well the name as the nature of the
which, no man can vnderstand) vndoubtedlye,
eyther of theym are so pure and
perfect thinges, that at theyr departure
they can not abyde on the ground. And
truly some one of these is the soule. For
so quycke a spyryte lyeth not drenched
in the heart, brayne, or bloude, as Empedocles
saieth. But as for Dicearchus
with his scoole felowe Aristorenus,
(learned men both) we will nowe ouerpasse:

of the whyche, the one seemes neuer
to haue felt ani griefe, who thinkes
that he hathe no soule, and the other is
so delighted with his notes and tunes,
that he assayeth to allude them to these
earnest matters. But a harmonye is
made of the diuersitye of tunes, the sun
dry settinge of the whyche, maye make
many sweete harmonyes: but the conformitye
of a mannes lymmes, and the
whole shape of his bodye, withoute a
soule what harmonye it maye make,
I can by no meanes vnderstande. But
he be learned, may in this matter geus
place to his mayster Aristotle, and he
himselfe practise singīg. For it is wiselye
counsayled of the Greekes in a certayne
prouerbe in this sort.

                     In what Arte eche man skilfull is
and most profoundly seene.
                     The same alway to exercise, it doth
him best beseeme.
                  
               
               But that foolyshe opinion, of the fallinge
together of certayne indiuisible,
lyght, and rounde bodyes, let vs vtterlye
roote out: which neuerthelesse Democritus
ymagineth to be whole and

breathing, that is to saye of an aery nature.
So the soule (whych if it be of any
of those .iiii. bodyes, whereof all thinges
are made, doth vndoubtedly consist
of fyer, whiche opinion Panetius also
liketh best) must nedes flie to the higher
regions: For those .ii. elementes, namelye
fyer and aer, haue no fallynge, but
go alwayes vpwardes. So it comes
to passe, that whether they are scattered
farre from the earth, or els do abide
and alwayes kepe theyr owne nature,
by all these reasons it must necessarilye
folowe, y• our soules ascend vnto heauē
deuiding thys grosse & compound aer,
which is next to ye earth. For our soule
is more whote, or rather more fyerye,
then this aer, which I termed whilome
grosse and compound. And that hereby
we may wel perceiue: because our dumpishe
earthly bodies do ware whote, wt
the heate of our mindes. Furthermore,
it must nedes be, ye the soule must lightly
passe through this aer (whiche I doe
often terme grosse) because there is nothinge
more swifte then it, neyther
anye suche quickenesse, as may by anne

meanes be compared with the quickenes
of the same. Whiche if he remayne
vnwasted, and like to his former being
he muste needes so moue, that he, shall
pearce and cut all this lower aer, in the
which, cloudes, wyndes, and showers,
are gathered. Which is both moist and
cloudye with the exhalracions of the
earth. Which region after it hath once
passed, and attayned to a nature like to
it selfe, being there stayed amiddes the
lighte aer, and temperate heate of the
sonne, he resteth vppon the fyer, and
there maketh an ende of ascending any
higher. For when it hath gotten heate
and lyghtnes congruent to his nature,
then as a thing equallye paysed, it moneth
neyther vpwardes nor downewardes.
And there at the last is his naturall
seate, when it hath once pearced
to thinges in nature like to it selfe. In
the whiche wythoute the want or lacke
of any thinge, it shalbe nouryshed, and
sustayned with suche foode as the sterres
theym selues are fed and nouryshed
wythal. And whereas here, the prickes
of the fleshe are wont commonly to enflame

vs, to all ill motions, as we are
so muche the more kindled by them, as
we enuy those, that haue the same thinges
that we desyre to haue: then trulye
we shal be happy, when our bodyes being
ones dissolued, we shall be rid from
all yil desyres and emulations. And
that, whiche we nowe do when we are
voyde of eare (I meane the giuinge of
oure selues, to the consideration and
weyghing of some thing perteyning to
knoweledge) that shall we then do
with much more libertie, and setle oure
selues wholy, to the contemplation and
viewinge of nature: both because naturallye
there is graffed in oure mindes,
an insatiable desyre to know the trouth
and also because the place it selfe, to the
whiche we shall come, because it wyll
shewe vnto vs, a more easie knowledge
of those thinges whyche we desyre to
knowe, muste nedes encrease in vs the
desyre and loue of knowledge, the beautye
of the which place, hathe in this filthie
earth, stirred vp, that auncient and
heauenly philosophy as Theophrastus
sayeth) kyndled fyrst wyth the desyre of

knoweledge. But that heauenly pleasure
they chiefely shal enioy, whiche although
when they dwelte in this lowe
earthe, they hadde their senses cloked
with the cloudes of erroure, yet in
minde did still r newe the memorye of
that heauenlye place, frome whence
they fyrste came, for if they here thynke
them selues great trauaylers, whyche
haue sene the crickes of ye sea Eurinus
and those strayghtes, by the whych the
ship passed which was called Argo.

                     Because in her some chosen men of
Greece.
                     To Colchos sayled to winne the golden
Fleece.
                     Or those whyche haue seene the greate
                     Oceane seas, and eke that place where
                     The surginge waues with suryous
force Europe and Afrike part.
                  
               
               What syght may we thinke that shall
be? when we shall beholde the whole
earthe, the situation, forme, and description
of the same, the places inhabyted,
and suche againe, as eyther because of
parchinge heate, or fresynge colde, doe
lacke inhabi
                     •
                  auntes. For nowe trulye,

se not so much as those thinges whyche
we se with our bodelye eyes, neyther is
there any sense in our bodye. But (as
not onelye the naturall Philosophers,
but also the Phisicians do saye, who
haue seene the same opened and disclosed)
certayne wayes and holes there be,
bound frome the inner vaute of oure
minde, to our eyes, eares, and nosethrilles.
And for this cause sometyme
it hapneth, that we are so blynded, eyther
wyth some sadde thought, or vehemente
disease, that oure eyes and eares
beynge both hole and open, yet we can
neyther heare nor see. So that we may
well perceyue, that it is oure mynde,
that seeth and heareth, and not those
partes, whiche are but the casementes
of the same. Without the whyche, neuerthelesse,
the minde it selfe can perceyue
nothinge, vnlesse it be earnestlye
bent thereon. Besydes all this, what a
thinge is it, that the minde onelye, can
cōtaine thinges of most diuers nature?
as colours, tastes, feelynges, smels and
soundes? which by the .v. sēses only, the

mind could neuer discerne, were it not
that al thinges comming to it by them:
it onely is iudge of all. And then truly,
these thinges shall be more playne and
clearely sene, whē as the soule is come
to his owne naturall libertye. For now
in deede, althoughe nature hathe verye
suttely wrought certayne passages frō
the soule to the body: yet neuerthelesse,
the same are compassed, and in maner
stopped vp wyth certayne grosse and
earthlye bodyes. But when there shall
be nothinge, but the soule it selfe, then
there shal be no let, but that it may wel
discerne and iudge, what eche maner of
thinge is. I could here describe (if my
matter so requyred) howe manye, and
howe sundrye delectable syghtes the
soule shall haue, in those heauenlye regions.
The whych, sometimes when I
do remember, I can not but wonder at
the vanitye of certayne Philosophers,
whiche haue the secrete knoweledge of
naturall philosophye in great admyratian:
and therefore thanke and prayse
wyth all theyr hartes, the inuenter and
finder of the same, and worship him as

God: sayeng, that by this his benefyte,
they are deliuered of ryght heauy maysters:
that is to wite, continuall terror,
and dayly and nightly feare. For what
so doating a foole is there, that woulde
feare those thinges, whiche you, if you
had not the knoweledge of natural philosophy,
would haue feared.

                     The Temples low of Acheron, with
palenes all bespred.
                     And dennes ful depe of doleful death
with darkenes al beset.
                  
               
               Is it not a shame, for Philosophers to
boaste, that nowe they feare not these
thinges, but knowe theym to be false?
Maye not a man thinke theym quicke
witted, whiche woulde haue credited
these thinges, had not learning perswaded
thē to the contrarye? But they haue
gotten knoweledge enoughe, whyche
haue perswaded thē selues, that at the
time of theyr death they should wholye
peryshe? which if we graunt to be true,
(for I wil not at this time muche contend
with them) what haue they therein
eyther to be glad or proude of? neyther
yet can I see anye cause, why the

opinion of Pithagoras & Plato, should
not be true. For were it so, that Piato
brought no reason (see in what estimation
I haue that man) his verye authoritye
should moue me. But he hath confirmed
his opinion wyth so manye
proofes, that it appeareth, that both he
was willing to perswade and also hath
perswaded. But there be many against
him, whyche thinke our soules cōdemned
to death: neyther is there any other
cause, why they will not beleue the eternitye

                     •
                  f the same, then because they
can not well ymagine or thinke, what
maner thing the soule should be without
the bodye. As though they coulde
vnderstande, what maner thinge it is,
whiles it is in the bodye: what shape it
hathe, what quantitye, or what place.
But if it were possible, that they might
see all the inwarde partes enclosed in
mannes bodye, whyche nowe are seperate
frome oure syghte: whether they
should see the soule, or whether it is of
suche subtill nature, that they could by
no meanes discerne it, that let theym
weyghe, whyche denye, that they can

ymagine any soule wythout the bodye.
they must fyrst see, what maner thinge
they will thinke him to be, whyles he
is in the bodye. For to me assuredly (dyuers
times, when I ponder with my
selfe the nature of the soule) it seemes a
farre darker and deeper consideration,
to thinke, what and howe the soule
coulde be in the bodye, as in a straunge
habitation: then what it shall be, when
it shall depart from thence, and flye into
the open heauens, as to his propre
and appoynted place. For if it be not
possible for vs to comprehende in oure
mindes such thinges as we neuer sawe
then, neyther god him selfe, neither yet
oure soule that came from God, what
it shalbe, when it is departed from our
bodyes, can we well ymagine. Dicearchus
and Aristoxenus (for that it was
a deepe and a weyghty matter, to consyder
what the soule might be) said that
there was no soule at all. And surelye,
it is the chyefest poynt of wytte, wyth
the soule to knowe the soule: and that
is the wyse meanynge of that sage

precept of Apollo, whyche willeth vs to
knowe our selues. For I can not think
that it shoulde bidde vs to knowe oure
lymmes, stature, or shape. For we are
not bodyes: neyther, when I speake to
you, do I talke to your body. Therfore
when he sayeth knowe thy selfe, he sayeth
as muche in effecte, as knowe thy
selfe. For thy bodye is but the vassayle,
and dongeon of thy minde. Whatsoeuer
thy soule dothe, that is thine owne
deede. And vnlesse it had bene thought
an heauenly thing, to knowe the soule:
that precepte had neuer bene taken to
haue bene of such excellency, as to haue
bene imputed to God. But, if he know
not, what maner thinge his soule is,
howe shall he knowe, that he him selfe
eyther lyueth, or moueth? And hereuppon,
is grounded that reason of Plato,
whiche is declared by Socrates, in the
booke called Phedrus, and rehearsed
of me, in my syrt booke of a comē welth
That which alwayes moueth, is euerlastinge.
But, aswell that whiche moueth
other thinges, as also that whiche
is moued by other, whan it ceasseth to

moue, ceasseth also to liue. Onelye that
therefore, which moues it selfe (because
it can neuer forsake it selfe) can not but
moue. It also, is a fountayne and beginninge
of motion, to other thinges
whych are moued. Nowe of a principle
there can be no beginninge. For of a
principle all thinges are made, and it
takes his beginning of no other, (for it
were no principle, if it toke beginninge
of any other thing.) Then if it hath no
beginning, neither hath it any ending.
For a principle being ones extynct, can
neyther it selfe at any time be reuyued,
neyther yet create, or make anye other
thing, wheras al thinges take theyr beginning
of a principle. So we see, that
the beginning of al motions, procedeth
of that which is moued of it selfe. But
that, can neyther haue beginning, nor
ending (not though the skie should fal, &
all thinges stande at a staye) neyther
yet any outward force, by the which it
should be moued. Wherfore, inasmuch
it appeareth, that that is euerlastyng,
whych moueth it selfe: and no man will
denye that our soules are of that sorte,

(for whatsoeuer is moued by anye outward
motiō, and not of it selfe, is without
life) it must nedes folowe, that since
it is the onelye propertye and nature of
the soule (amonges so manye sundrye
thinges) to be moued of it selfe: it neyther
at any time heretofore had begynnynge,
nor at anye time hereafter shall
haue endinge. Let all the raskall Phylosophers
laye theyr heades togither,
(for so it semeth good vnto me to terme
them, whyche swarue from Plato, and
Socrates, and from theyr sect) they shal
neither at any time expresse any thinge
so eloquently, neither yet be able to perceyue
how suttelye this selfe same reason
is concluded. The soule therfore,
perceiueth that he him selfe doth moue:
wherewithall it feeles also, that it is of
his owne power, and not of any forren
force: & that it can by no meanes chaūc
                     •
                  
that he should forsake him selfe. Wher
by it is concluded, ye he is euerlastinge.
Nowe let me heare, what you can saye
against this.
            
            
               Hea.
               I truly can not suffer
my selfe, so muche as to ymagine anye
thyng contrarye vnto it: I do so muche
Rauour your opinion herein.
            
            
               Mar.
               How

thinke you thē, of those thinges which
are in the soule? which, if I could by ani
meanes conceiue, how thei might haue
beginning, I could wel ymagine howe
they might peryshe also. For bloude,
choler, fleame, bones, sinowes, vaynes
& al the frame of our body, I could wel
ymagine howe, and wherof it is made.
The soule it selfe, if it had no greater
thing in it, then, that it is causer of our
lyfe, I could lightlye be perswaded, y• a
man might as wel liue by the power of
nature, as a vine, or any other tree. Also
if it had no straunger properties then
to desire some thinges & to abstaine frō
other, I could thinke yt that wer as wel
cōmon to beastes as to it. But firste it
hath an infinite remēbraunce of a wonderfull
nūber of thinges, emonges the
which, Plato reckeneth ye recordinge of
our former life. For in yt booke, whych
is entitled Memnon, Socrates demaū
                  deth
certaine questiōs of a childe, as cō
                  cerning
the measures of a foure square:
to ye which he aunswereth as any child
might, but yet neuerthelesse, the questions
are so easy, that he aūswereth him
so, as if he had learned Geometrye.
               
                  Whereby Socrates concludeth, that to
learne, is nothinge els, then to remember.
This place also he handeleth more
at large, in that talke, whiche he hadde
that selfe same daye, that he departed
out of this life. For he saieth that when
a rude and ignoraunt man, dothe aunswere
wel to one that questioneth wiselye
with him, then he dothe playnely
                     •
                  
shewe, that he doth not thē learne those
thinges but remēbreth thē, as thinges
which he had almost forgotten. He sayeth
also, that we coulde by no meanes,
from oure childhoode haue the generall
groundes of so many thinges placed in
our mindes, vnlesse oure soule afore it
entred into our bodye, had liued in the
knoweledge of the same. And whereas
the body is nothing, as Plato in all his
workes doth reason (for he takes that
as nothing, which hath had beginning
and shall haue ending, and that onelye
to be which shall continue for euer) the
soule could not come to the knowledge
of these thinges, whiles he was enclosed
in the bodye, but brought them thyther
wyth him. Neyther yet dothe it

clearelye perceyue the same at the first,
when it sodaynelye cometh into the bodye,
as into a troubled mansion, but after
that it hath reuoked and reposed it
selfe, it recounteth suche thinges as it
knewe before. So to learne is no other
thing, then to remeber. But I do wonder
at oure remembraunce after an other
sorte. For what is it, whereby we
do remember? or from whence hath our
nature that force or power? I do not
here aske how notable the memorye of
Symonides was, eyther of Theodectes,
or els of Cyneas, the ambassadour
whych came from Pyrrhus to the Senate,
or of Carneades, or of Scepsius
Metrodorus, or els of our countreiman
Hortensius. I speake of the memoryes
of the comen sorte of men. And of those
inespeciallye, whiche spende the moste
part of theyr lyfe in study: whose memory
how great it is, it is hard to thynke.
They remember so many and sundrye
thinges. But to what ende belongeth
this my talke? To consider what thys
power of remēbraunce, & from whence
it is. It comes not surely, frō the hart,

bloude, or brayne, neither yet from Democritus
moa
                     •
                  es. I knowe not whether
the soule be fyer or aer, neither am
I ashamed to confesse, that I am ignoraunt
in that whiche I knowe not, but
this I may boldly affirme (as wel as anye
man maye, in so darke a matter as
this is) that whether the soule be fyer
or aer, it is vndoubtedlye an heauenlye
thing. For, is there any mā that would
thinke, that so wonderfull a power of
memorye, could be made eyther of the
earth, or els of this darke & cloudy aer?
For although you do not see, what our
remēbraunce is, yet what maner thing
it is, you may wel perceyue. Or, if that
you can not do, yet you may wel vnderstand
how great a thing it is. Shall we
then thinke, that there is any capacity,
or voide place in the soule, into ye which
as into a vessel, all those thinges which
we do remember are powred? That trulye
were very foolyshe. For, what bottome
mighte there be, of such a vessell?
or, what mighte be the shape, of suche
a soule? or what so greate widenes
mighte there be in the soule? What?

should we thinke, that our soule is imprinted,
as it were waxe, and that our
remembraunce is the ouersight of those
thinges, which sticke imprynted in our
heartes? But what pryntes may there
be of wordes? eyther what suffyciente
marckes of thynges? or what so huge a
space maye there be in the soule, in the
which all those thynges whyche we remember,
myght be prynted? Furthermore,
what thynke you of that parte of
our mynde, whyche syndeth oute suche
thynges, as were neuer knowen before
and is therefore called inuention, can
that be made of this earthlye, frayle,
and compounde nature thynke you?
               What thinke you of him, whyche fyrst
of all, gaue euerye thinge his propre
name (whyche Pythagoras counted a
part of great wisedome) or of him whiche
fyrst gathered men together, to one
society, & felowship of life? what thinke
you of him also, who firste cōprised the
tunes of our voice (which somed to be in
maner infinite) in a fewe notes? Or of
him, who first marked ye motions, progressions,
& stations of the .7. planets?

How iudge you also of them, who fyrst
founde oute corne, cloathinge, houses,
orders for mans life, & defence againste
wilde beastes? by whom, after that we
were tamed, and broughte from wildenes,
besydes oure necessities, we haue
inuented thinges for pleasure. For ther
is inuented, a temperate varietie of the
diuers nature of sundrye tunes, to delyght
our eares, and also our eyes toke
great pleasure, in markīg, as wel those
sterres, whyche are fastned in certayne
places of the fyrmament, as also the other,
whiche are called (althoughe they
be not so in deede) wanderers: the conuersions
and motions of the whyche,
whose soule did fyrste perceyue, he dyd
playnely teache, that his soule was like
to him, which had fyrst made those thinges
in heauen. For, when Archymedes
made the motions of the Moone, the
Sonne, and the other fyue Planettes,
in the artificiall Spheare, he didde as
muche as God (whome Plato bringeth
in in his booke entituled Tymcus, makyng
the world) when he made the turninge
of one Spheare, to rule seuerall

motions, differynge bothe in slowenes
and swyftenes. Whiche, if in the motion
of the whole worlde it can not be
done, wythout the hand of god, neither
coulde Archymedes in his materyall
Spheare, haue imitated the same, with
out an heauenlye wyt. Neyther yet can
I see, howe these accustomed thynges
with the whych we are dayly acquaynted,
can be done wythout an heauenlye
power. As that a Poete shoulde wryte
a graue and full verse, wythoute some
heauenlye influence, or that a man
should be eloquent with pleasaunt wordes,
and weyghty sentences, wythoute
some greater inuention, then the witte
of man. But philosophy, the mother of
all artes, what other thynge is it, then
(as Plato sayeth) the gyfte and (as I
thinke) the inuention of the gods? She
fyrst taught vs the worshippe of them,
and secondarelye, to vse right towards
all men, and then afterwardes modestye,
& stoutenes of stomake. She draue
away all darkenes from the soule, whiles
it is in the prison of the bodye, that
it might see all thinges, as well highe

and lowe, as farre and neare. And sure
lye, this seemes to me, to be a heauenly
thynge, whyche dothe so manye and so
wonderfull thinges. For what is the
remembraunce of wordes and deedes?
what is inuention? assuredly such thinges
they are, as a man can not imagine
greater, in god him selfe. For I do not
think, that the gods are delighted with
the foode whyche the Poetes call Ambrosia,
or wyth the heauenlye drynke,
whych they call Nectari: neyther can I
thinke, that they haue yonge boyes
waytynge at theyr tables: neyther do I
beleue Homere, whyche wryteth, that
Ganimedes was taken vp into heauen
to be cupbearer to Iupiter. It is no sufficient
cause, why he should do Laomedon
so much iniury. Homere fayned it,
and applied the qualities of men to the
gods. I had rather that he had deriued
the properties of ye gods vnto vs: namely
to be wyse, to inuent, and to remember.
The soule nowe, whych (as I saye)
is a heauenly thing, as Euripides feareth
not to saye is god him selfe. And
truly, if god be either aer or fyer, he is

the soule of man. For as the heauenlye
nature is voyde bothe of earthlye substance,
and also wateryshe moysture, so
in lykewyse, is the soule of man compounded
of none of them bothe: But if
it be a certayne fyft nature (as Aristotle
first inuented) assuredlye, as well the
gods, as our soules, do consyste of the
same substaunce. Which opiniō we folowing,
haue thus expressed, in our bookes
which we entituled of consolation.
there can be foūd no original nor beginning
of our soules in the earthe: sith in
them nothinge is mixt or cōpound, nothing
made or framed of earth, nothing
moyst or a
                     •
                  rye, ne yet of fyerie nature:
for in these foure natures there is nothinge,
that hath the power to remember,
inuent, or ymagine, that can either
beare in memory thinges paste, foresee
such as are to come, or rightly weyghe
such as are presēt. Which propertyes &
giftes, as they are heauenly, so no man
can imagine howe they maye come to
man but from God. Whereby it seemeth
that the nature of the soule, is other
then these foure: & seperated from
these accustomed & commen natures.
               
                  So whatsoeuer it is, that can discern
                     •
                  
by the senses, can iudge by discrecyon,
or can wil, or not will, that must nedes
be of an heauenly force and power, and
for that selfe same cause euerlastynge.
For god him selfe (whome we can not
conceyue, but by the force of oure vnderstandinge)
we can ymagine to be no
other thing, then a loose and free soule,
seperate frome all mortall concretion,
seenge and mouing all thinges, it selfe
beinge moued of nothinge, and of this
selfe same force and nature is the mind
of man. Where then, or what is thy
soule? canst thou tel me where, or what
maner thinge it is? But if I haue not
so manye helpes to the knoweledge of
my soule as I woulde wyshe to haue,
wilte thou therfore let me, to vse those
thinges, which I haue to the vnderstandinge
of my soule? the soule is not able
in this bodye to see him selfe. No more
is the eye whyche although he seeth all
other thinges, yet (that whiche is one
of the leaste) can not discerne his owne
shape. But admit that the soule can not
consider him selfe: howebeit perhaps he

may. His operacions, as quyckenes of
inuention, sure remembraunce, continuance
and swiftnes of motion, it doth
well ynoughe perceyue. And these be
greate, yea heauenlye, yea euerlastinge
thinges. But of what shape it is, or
where it resteth we oughte not to enquyre.
As when we see the forme and
beautye of the heauens, furthermore
suche quyckenes of motion, as we can
scarce conceyue, also the continual courses
of day? and nyght, the foure chaunges
of the yeare, conueniēt both for the
rypening of fruytes, and also for the tē
                  perate
disposicion of our bodyes. Besydes
this, when we see the sonne, the
causer and worker of all encrease, and
the moone whose encrease and decrease
of lyght, doth in steede of Calender, descrybe
vnto vs the chaunges of euerye
daye, when we beholde the other fyue
planettes, whych most constantly continue
one set course (vnder that Circle
whiche is deuided into .xii. equall partes)
with vnequal motions, and the faces
of the skyes, by nyghte on all sydes
set with starres, and the globe of the

earthe (saued from the sea, and fyxed in
the middest of the whole world) in some
places habitable, and wel tilled, of the
which one part (whych we inhabite) is
placed vnder the North starre, where
The blousteringe Northerne blastes
congeale the frosen snowe.
               
               And the other farre in the south, which
the Greekes call 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   whereas
the other partes be not inhabited, eyther
because they are frosen with cold,
or parched with heate. But here where
we dwell at appoynted seasons.

                     The Sunne doth shyne, the trees
doth burgen greene.
                     The mery Uynes, wyth clusters
are bespred.
                     The bindynge trees wyth fruyte
a ioye to seene.
                     The corne doth spring, & thinges
that erst were dead.
                     As nowe reuiued their olde shape
of do cast.
                     The fountayns flowe, and grasse
waxe greene a newe
                     When Somers heate hath chaū
                        ged
the Wynters hue.
                  
               
               Furthermore whē we se the multitude

of beastes ordained partly for our foode
partly for ye tillage of our groūd, partly
to cary vs, & partly to clothe vs, & man
amonges al these thinges a beholder of
the heauens & gods, & a worshipper of
the same: & furthermore, all thinges as
wel in land as in sea, prouided for the
profite of mankind: these & other innumerable
workes of god, as oft as we do
behold, must we not nedes acknowlege
that if these thinges were at any time
made, there must be some worker & maker
of thē? Or els if they haue bene for euer,
from the beginning (as Arystotle
thinkes) y• at the least there is some ruler
& gouerner of so greate a worke. So
likewise although thou canst not se the
soule of mā, no more thē thou canst god
him selfe, yet neuerthelesse, as yu dost acknoweledge
god by his workes so likewise
seing the infinite remēbraunce of
thinges, the quickenes of inuentiō, the
swiftnes of motiō in the same, & finally
all the beautie of vertue, y• must nedes
confesse the diuyne & heauenlye power
of the same. In what place is it then? I
thinke truly in the heade. And whye I
so thinke, I can bryng many reasons.
               
                  But that we will referre to an other
time. And now dispute where the soule
is. In thee he is assuredlye. What nature
hathe it? a nature properlye belonging
to it selfe, as I thinke. But admit
that it had the nature eyther of fyer or
aer. For that is nothinge to oure purpose.
This onely consyder, that as you
knowe God, althoughe his place and
shape you knowe not, so likewyse, you
ought to conceyue your soule, although
you knowe neyther his mansion place,
nor forme. And trulye, as concernynge
the soule, we can not doubt (vnlesse we
will confesse oure selues wholye ignoraunt
in naturall philosophy,) but that
there is no motion in the same, no composition,
no concretion, no copulation,
nor coagmentacion. Which if it be so,
assuredlye it can neuer be seperated, departed,
disseuered, or sundred: and for
that cause, neyther can it die. For death
is the departing, seperatynge, and loosynge
of those partes, whiche before
death were conioyned. Wyth this reason,
and suche like, Socrates being moued,
did neyther desyre anye patrone to

pleade for him, when the iudges gaue
him dome of death, neyther yet became
he an humble sutor to theym, for the
lengthning of his lyfe. But vttered alwayes
a stoute stubbernes, procedinge
not of pryde, but of a hautye courage.
Yea, and the very last daye of his lyfe,
he reasoned much of this selfe same question:
and a fewe dayes afore, when he
might easely haue bene conueyed oute
of pryson, he would not: and finallye at
the time of his deathe, holdinge in hys
hand the cuppe that should poysō him,
spake in such sort, that he seemed not to
be compelled to dye, but wyth a feruēt,
desyre to clyme vp to heauen. For thus
he thought, and so he taught, that ther
were .ii. wayes and courses of our soules,
when they departe oute of oure bodyes.
For such as had defyled them selues
with sinne, and had geuen theym
selues ouer to lust, and pleasure wherwyth
they beinge blynded, had stayned
the nobilitye of theyr soules, wyth walowynge
in vyce, or otherwyse fraudulently
gouerninge the commen welth,
such he thought wente by a path seperated

from the counsell of the gods, but
suche, as had kepte thē selues pure and
holye, and were leaste defyled with the
fylth of they
                     •
                   bodyes, but had alwayes
called them selues frō the filthy lustes
of the same, and whyles they lyued in
theyr bodyes,

                  ad 
                     •
                  mitated the lyfe of
the gods, such he thought had, an easye
retourne to the place, frō whence they
first came. And for that cause he saieth,
that a
                     •
                   the swannes (which not w
                     •
                  thout
cause are dedicated to Apollo, but
because they seeme to haue of him the
gift of naturall prophecye) foreseeynge
what pleasure is in deathe, do dye singinge
with greate delyght: so ought al
good and learned men to do. Neyther
truly could any man doubte hereof, but
that as ofte as we muse muche of the
nature of our foule, we are in such case
as they are wonte to be, who when
they haue a long space beheld the sonne
are made in maner blynde with the
bryghtnes thereof. And so likewyse the
eyes of our minde beholdyng it selfe, do
often ware dimme: and by that meanes
we lose the diligence of contemplation
of the same. So the indgemente of

our opinions, doubtynge, wauerynge,
staggering, & pōdering many doubtes,
is driuen as a waueryng shyppe in the
mayne sea. But these exāples are coū
                  ted
state, & come frō the Grecians. But
Cato our countreymā, so departed out
of thys life, as one that was glad, that
he had gotten iust occasion to dye. For
that god that ruleth wythin vs, forbiddeth
vs to departe hence withoute his
leaue. But when soeuer he shall gyue
vs a iust cause (as he did to Socrates,
now of late to Cato, & often heretofore
to manye other) then truly, euery wise
man wil gladly depart frō this darkenes
into that light. Neither yet oughte
he to breake ye bandes of his prison (for
that the lawes of god do forbid) but to
depart frō thence when he is deliuered
& called by God, as an officer or other
lawfull power. For all the life of wise
men (as he in like wise sayeth) is ye practise
of death. For what other thing do
we, whē we cal our mind frō pleasure,
that is the body, frō the cares of welth
& richesse, which is the minister & hand
maid of ye body, to cōclude whē we separate
our selues frō all s

wealth, and from all other businesse,
what do we then (I saye) but call oure
soule to it selfe: compellinge it to retourne
to it selfe, and to wythdrawe it
selfe, as muche as may be, frō the coniunction
of the bodye: and to separate
the soule from the body, is nothing els
then to dye. Wherfore let vs practyse
thys, to seuer oure selues from our bodyes,
that is as much to saye, let vs accustome
oure selues to dye. For that,
both whyles we lyue here in the earth,
shal be lyke to that heauenlye lyfe, and
also, when we beinge loosed from the
bandes of our bodye, shal wend towardes
the heauēs, so much the lesse flowe
shall we fynde our course thyther wardes.
For they whych haue alwayes liued
in the fetters and gyues of theyr
body, yea when they are loosed go some
what more slowelye: as those whyche
many yeares haue bene laden wyth yrons.
For truly this lyfe is but deathe:
whyche I could lament more at large,
if I lysted.
            
            
               Hea.
               You haue done that
sufficiently in your boooke whyche you

to leaue this body. But now whiles I

(whom neuerthelesse I do not despyse,
but I knowe not howe, eche learned
man sets at nought) But also mine
owne dearlig Dicearchus, hath sharplye

writen agaynst this immortality of
our soules. For he wrote three bookes,
which are called the bookes of Les
                     •
                  os,
because the same disputacion was kept
at Mitylena, in the which he assayes to
proue, that our soules are mortall. And
the Sto

                  kes do but lende vs the vsing
of the lyfe of our soules for a space, to
make vs as longe liued as dawes. For
they saye that our soules shall abyde a

death is not to be counted an euell.
            
            
               Hea.
               That do as you thinke good, but
no man shall remoue me from my opinion,
as concerning the immortalitye
of our soules.

               I cōmend you therfore,
howebeit, I woulde not haue you
to be to rashe in allowyng opinions.
               For we are lightly moued, with a wittie
reason, and stagger & chaunge oure
opinion, yea thoughe the matters be
somewhat play

                  e. Yet neuertheles, in
these there is some darkenes. But if any
such thing should happen, we ought
to be armed with witty conclusyons.

               Wel spoken: but I doubt not but

               Is there any cause then,
why we should not ouerpasse our frendes
the Stoikes? them I meane, which
saie that oure soules abide for a while
after that they are departed out of our
bodyes, but not euer. Who, inasmuch

opinion of the immortalitye of the

                  yt, as of yeares. He
bryngeth also this other reason: that

                  at soeuer may be sick shal

                  e) do feele griefe
wherfore they shal also die. These thinges
may lightly be refu
                     •
                  ed. For hereby
it semeth, that he was ignoraunt, that
when we talke of the eternitye of the
soule, we do therin compryse the minde
whiche is alwayes voyde of anye troublous
motion, or affection, and do not
talke of those partes, in the whych, sorow,
anger, and lustes are. Which, he
against whom I nowe reason, thinkes
to be sundred and seuered frō the mind.
For the likelynes of nature, doth more
appeare in beastes, which haue no reason:
but the outwarde gesse of the soule
of man, doth much consyst in the shape
of his bodye. For it is much materiall,

in what sortes of bodyes the soules be
placed. For there be manye thinges in
the bodye, that quycken the minde, and
manye thinges whiche dulle the same.
Aristotle sayes, that all wittye men be
of melancholie complexion, by the whiche
reason it greueth me not at al to acknoweledge
my selfe to be blunt witted.
He reckens vp manie thinges to
proue ye same: & (as if it were certaine)
shewes the reason of it. Then, yf there
be a great force of those thynges that
are in the bodye, as concerning the disposition
of the mynde, there is no necessitye,
why the workes of the soule
should be alyke in euerye bodye. But I
let this passe. I woulde to god Panetius
might be here present. He lyued in
the time of Africanus. I woulde fayne
knowe of him, to whome of his kinsemen
Africanus brothers cosen was
like: who beinge fauoured muche like
his father, yet in his lyfe did so muche
refemble euery vnthryfte, that he was
commonlye counted the worste that
myghte be. Also to whom was the nephewe
of Publius Crasius (a righte

wyse and eloquente man) like? and so
likewyse of dyuers other notable mens
children, and other theyr kynsefolkes,
whych I nede not here to remember.
               But wherof do I nowe intreate? haue
I forgotten, that this is my purpose,
after I had spoken sufficiently of the eternity
of our soules, to shew also, that
yf they did dye, there could be no euel in
death.
            
            
               Hearer.
               I remembred it well
ynoughe: but whyles you talked of the
eternitye of the soule, I suffered you
wyth a good wyll to staye in the same.
            
            
               Marcus.
               I perceyue that your minde
is on hygh thinges, and that you wyll
euen clyme into heauen.
            
            
               Hear.
               I hope
so. But admit (as these men will haue
it) that oure soules remayne not after
deathe, then I perceyue, that we haue
loste the hope of immortall life in heauen.
            
            
               Mar.
               What harme (I praye you)
doth that opynion brynge? admyt that
our soule shall dye as our body? is there
then anye gryefe, or anye sence at all,
in our bodye? no man sayeth so: albeit
Epicurus layeth it to Democritus

charge. But his scolers denye it. Then
if there be no feelynge in the bodye after
deathe, neyther doth there remaine
anye sense in the soule. For it is in no
place. Where then is the euell? But
perchaunce they will saye, that the departynge
of the bodye from the soule,
is not wythoute griefe. Admyt that
there be some, howe litle is it? howebeit
I thynke there is none at all.
               For it happens commonlye wythoute
anye sence, yea, and some times wyth
pleasure, yea and it is but lyghte, what
so euer it be. For it is done in a mynute
of tyme. But this it is that gryeueth
vs, or rather vexeth vs, the departynge
from all those thinges, whyche
we counte commodityes in oure lyfe.
But I feare me that they may be more
trulye called euels. What shoulde I
here bewaile the lyfe of man? although
I well maye, and that vppon iusts
and good occasyon.
               But what neede I, inasmuche as I
do intreate, whether after deathe we

shall be wretches, to make our lyfe in
bewaylynge to seeme more miserable?
we haue done that sufficientlye, in that
booke, in the whiche (as muche as we
might) we haue comforted oure selues.
Deathe therfore, deliuereth vs from euels,
and not frō goodes, if we speake
the truthe. And that truly, is so largely
reasoned of Egesyas the Cyreman,
that he was forbidden of the king Ptolomeus
to teache the same in scooles:
for that many after his doctrine, dydde
wyllingly kyll thē selues. There is an
Epigramme of Callimachus, vppon
Cleombrotus the Ambrocian: whome
he sayes, after that he had perused Platos
booke of the immortalitye of the
soules, foorth wyth wythout any other
apparent cause, caste him selfe headelonges
downe from a wall. But the
matter of the booke of Egesias (of whō
I spake euen now) is such. He faineth
that a certayne poore man, departed
out of this life, for want of necessarye
su
                     •
                  tenaunce, is reuoked agayne to life,
by his frendes: whom he aunsweryng,
reciteth all the discommodityes of mās

I coulde do so in likewyse: howe beit I
would not do it in such sorte as he dyd:
who counteth it good for no man to
liue in this worlde. I knowe not what
it were for other: but I am sure that
death had bene beste for me. Who beinge
nowe depryued of all comfort and
worshyp, both at home and abroade, if
I had afore time bene extinct by death:
I had assuredlye thereby bene delyuered
from much care, whyche since hath
chaunced me, and not from any ioye or
pleasure. Admit therfore, that there be
some one man who hath no aduersyty,
who hath in no part felt ye cruell stroke
of fortune. As the honorable Metellus
with his foure sonnes, and Priamus
wyth fyftye, of the whiche .xvii. were
borne of his lawefull wyfe, in bothe of
them fortune had the like stroke. But
to the one she shewed her selfe more fauourable.
For Metellus, many sonnes
and doughters, neuewes and neeces,
accompanyed to his graue. But Priamus,
being afore despoiled of so great
a stocke, seinge his children bathed in
theyr owne bloud, and last of al he him

selfe flyenge to the aul
                     •
                  are for refuge,
his enemyes hand dyd slaye. If deathe
had taken hym whyle his kyngedome
stoode.

                     Whiles that his corps was safe beset
with fyerce Barbarian route.
                     And whiles his palaice stode ygraued
with golde both in and out.
                  
               
               How thinke you, had he departed from
the pleasure whych myghte afterwardes
beside him, or els from the aduersytye
whych afterwardes befell hym?
at that tyme you would haue iudged it
had bene from pleasure. But assuredlye
it had bene farre better for him, yf
death had thē taken him. For then we
should neuer haue hearde this wofull
lamentynge.

                     The palayce erste of Pryam stoute,
I sawe the fyer waste.
                     And eke beheld when bloudy sworde
amids his body past.
                     When aulters of the heauenly gods
with bloud were all to dashte.
                  
               
               Neyther those thynges, nor any of lyke
sorte coulde haue chaunced vnto hym,
yf he had died before. For nowe at this

present, he is past the feelynge of al miseryes.
It chaunced somewhat better
to my frend Pompeius, when he came
gryeuously syc
                     •
                  e to Naples. For the
men of Naples had garlandes on their
heades, and the Citesyns of Puteolos
dyd all welcome hym home.
               A 
                     •
                  olyshe toye of the Grecians, but yet
it, 
                     ••••
                  ye as it happened. But if he had
dyed at that presente, had he departed
from prosperitye, (thinke you) or from
aduersitye? from aduersity vndoubtedlye.
For then he had not waged warre
with his sonne in law, he had not bene
fayne to flye to armes beynge vnprouided,
he had not left his house nor fled
Italye, and finallye his armye beynge
lost, he had not needed as a naked man
to fall into the handes of his seruauntes:
his poore children, al his substance
and wealth, had neuer bene enioyed of
the handes of his ennemyes. So he,
whych if he had dyed before, had departed
in maruaylous prosperytye, by the
lytle lengthenynge of hys lyfe, into
what myserye 
                     •
                  ell he?
               
                  
Loe, all suche miseryes are preuented
by death, although they do not caunce
yet because they maye chaunce.
               But men thinke that no suche thynge
can happen vnto theym, euerye man
hopes for the good lucke of Metellus:
as though either ther ought to be more
lucky men then vnlucky, or there were
any certaynty in the lyfe of man, or els
it were the part of a wyse man, rather
to hope, then feare. But let vs graunt,
that men lose manye commodityes by
deathe. Then will they saye that suche
as be deade, do lacke the commodityes
of this life, and therfore are miserable.
For so they must nedes reason. But I
pray you, can he which is not, lacke anye
thing? this worde lackynge is a sorowefull
terme. For there is included
in it, that he once had it, and nowe he
hath it not, but wants it, lackes it, and
misses it. I thinke, that is the discommoditye
of him that wants any thing.
As blindenes is the discommoditye of
him whiche lacketh his eyes: & barennes
of her, whych lacketh chyldren.
               But there is none of theym that is departed,

that lackes not onely not the c
                     •
                  
                  modities
of this life, no not so much as
this lyfe it selfe. I speake of suche as

               That therfore beynge stablyshed & fixed,
this must be discussed: what it is to
lacke: that there maye be no doubte in
the worde. To lacke therfore, signyfyeth
the want of that, which you would
haue. For there is a wyshinge for those
thynges whych we lacke: vnlesse it be
as we take this worde in an other significatiō?

For we say we lacke a thing,
in an other sense also. As whē we haue
not a thing, and we perceyue the lacke
of it, howebeit we may well abide the
want therof. But none of these wayes
can we terme anie lacke in death. For
we can not be sory for anye thinge that
we lack. That is sayde, to lack a good
thinge, whych is of it selfe euell. But a
man beyng aliue doth not lacke a good
thinge, vnlesse he feele the misse of it.
But of a liue mā, one may say, to lacke
a kingdome. Howbeit not so properly,
of such a one, as you who neuer was
kynge. But well of Tarquinius, who
was banished oute of his realme. But
in a dead man we can conceyue no such
thinge. For to lacke is properly sayd of
him whych feeles the lacke. But there
is no feeling in a dead man. No more
therfore is there any lacke in him. But
what nede we in this point to play the
philosophers, since we see yt as touchīg
this we nede it not. How oftē, haue not
onelye our captaynes, but also hole armies
runne to sure & vndoubted death?
Which if it were a thing to be feared,

hatefull thing in dede, if we did feele ye
lacke of it. But inasmuche as it is euident,
that nothynge can be in it, which
is not, what can there be hateful in it,
which neither doth lacke, neither feele
anye thynge? Howbeit we haue talked

of this to ofte. But I do it because that
herein consisteth all the feare, that we
conceyue of deathe. For when we see,
that our soules and bodies being spent
and all oure partes beynge brought to
fynall destruction, that whyche was a
lyuynge creature, is nowe become nothinge:
we muste nedes perceiue also,
that betwyxt a thyng that neuer was,
and kyng Agamemnon, there is no difference.
And in like sorte, that Camillus
dead long since, doth now no more
force for the ciuill warre, which is kept
at this present, then I toke thought for
the takyng of Rome, at suche tyme as
he lyued. Why should Camillus then
be sorye, if he had knowen in his lyfe
time, that .350. yeares after him, suche
thynges should happē? or I, yf I should
imagine, that ten thousād yeres hence,
some straunge nation should race oure
city. Yet such is the loue, that we owe
to our countrey, that we take thought
for it, for the good wil we beare it, and
not for any harme, that we beynge buryed,
may haue by the destruction of it.
Wherefore, deathe can not so feare a

man (which because of thincertainty of
our lyfe, doth continuallye hange ouer
our heades, & also because of the shortnes
of oure age can neuer be farre of)
but that he ought continuallye to haue
more respect to the commen welth, thē
to his life. And that he oughte also to
thinke, that those which shall come after
him, whose commodities or discommodities
he shall neuer feele, do in like
wise pertayne vnto him. therfore, euen
those that iudge our soule to be mortal,
may attempte thinges, whose remembraunce
shall long endure, not for anye
desyre of glory, whyche they shal neuer
feele, but for the good wyll they bare to
vertue, whom glory of necessitie dothe
folowe, albeit you looke not for it. But
the nature of al things is such, y• as our
byrth, is the originall cause and beginnynge
of all those thynges whyche we
haue, so in likewyse oure deathe is the
ende of the same: the payne of which,
as it did nothinge pertayne vnto vs, afore
our lyfe, so neyther shal it after our
death. Wherfore, what euel can there
be in death? whych pertayneth neyther

to such as liue, neyther yet to those that
are deade. For suche as are deade
are not at all, and suche as are alyue
it can not come to. Wherefore they
which wil speake truly of the nature of
death, do terme it a sleepe: as thoughe
a man shoulde passe the course of his
lyfe, for the space of .90. yeares, and
then, sleepe oute the reste. I thynke assuredlye,

you doubte whether there be anye feelynge
in death, since in the ymage and
pycture of the same, there is none at

al? Leaue of then this olde wyues tale,
that it is a wretched thynge to dye afore
thy tyme. What tyme I beseche
you? the tyme that nature hathe appoyneted?
But she hathe lente vs oure
lyfe to vsurye as it were, appoyntynge
no certayne daye when we shall repaye
the same. What cause haste thou then
to complayne, yf she requyre it of thee
when she lyffe? For thou hadst it vnder
such condicion. The same men, thinke
it a heauye case for one to dye beynge
but a boye, but yf he dye beynge an enfante,
in his cradell, they thynke that
then he hath no cause of complaynte.
               Yet neuerthelesse, of hym dyd nature
more sooner requyre that whyche she
had lent. O whyles he was a boye (say
they) he had not smatched the swetenes
of lyfe. But he was in lykelyhoode to
attayne to greate worshippe, whyche
euen at the time of his deathe he beganne
to come to. But I meruayle
muche synce that in all other thynges
it is counted better to attayne to

to some what then nothyng at all, why
then it should be otherwyse in our lyfe.
Howebeit Callimachus said very wel,
that Priamus had wept farre oftener
then euer did Troylus. But now, they
prayse muche theyr chaunce, which dye
in theyr age: and why so? Because (as
I thinke) if they might liue lōger, their
life could be no pleasanter, then it hath
bene. But assuredlye, there is nothing
that a man may take more pleasure of,
then of wysedome, the whych (if we
graunt that it taketh away other commodityes)
Yet that assuredlye olde age
dothe brynge. But what is this longe
age? or what is the lōg time of a man?
Do we not see, that age hath ouertakē
them, which were euen now but boyes
& stripelinges, when they least thought
of it? But yet beause we can lyue no lō
                  ger,
we call it longe. And so euery thinges
lyfe, according to the ende that nature
hathe appoynted it, maye well be
termed eyther longe or shorte. For about

through a part of Europa, into the sea

are bredde certaine beastes, which liue
but one day. Of them then, she that liueth

she that liueth till the sonne set, is as
one euen spent wyth age: and so muche
more if it be the longest day in the yere
Compare our age wyth immortalyry,
and we shall be found to liue in maner
as shorte a space, as those foolishe beastes.
Let vs then set asyde all this trifelinge
(for howe maye. I better terme it)
and let vs frame our selues to a perfect
lyfe, despysyng all vanitie, and trading
our selues in vertue. For nowe we are
euen puffed vp wyth wanton thoughtes,
so that if deathe ouertake vs afore
such time as we haue obtayned the promisses
of the sothsayers, we seeme ther
by to haue bene mocked, and defrauded
of many notable commodityes. And, if
at the time of our death, we hang in desires
and wishes (lord how we are vexed
and tormented, whereas that iourney
(o god) howe pleasaunt ought it to
be vnto vs? whyche beinge once paste,
there shall be no care nor trouble lefte?
O howe muche Theramenes doth delyghte

me? what a stoute courage seemeth
he to haue? For albeit I weepe,
as ofte as I reade the storye of him, yet
neuerthelesse, it reioyceth me to see,
howe stoutelye he dyed lyke a noble
man. Who lyenge in the pryson, after
he hadde there dronke vp the poyson
(whych the thyrtye tyrannes had sente
hym) wyth suche an earnest desyre, as
if he had thyrsted after it, he caste that
was lefte wyth suche a force out of the
cuppe, that it sounded on the floore
                     •
                  
whyche sounde he hearynge, smyled
and sayde. I begynne thys to Critias,
who was one of hys deadlyest enemyes.
For the Grecians in their bankets
were wont, to drinke to some mā,
namelye to him that should pledge thē.
So it pleased that noble man to ieste at
the time of his death, when he had that
within him whych should be his bane.
And he trulye prophecied death to hym
yt sent him the poison, which shortly after
ensued. Who would commēd suche
securitye in death, if he thoughte death
to be an euell thing? Into the same pryson,
and the same kynd of death, came

a fewe yeares after Socrates, condemned
so vniustlye of his iudges, as Theramenes
of the tyrauntes.
               Let vs heare the, what maner of wordes
Plato sayes he spake to the iudges,
when he was condemned to death. I
am in good hope (my lordes) quod he,
that I am happye, for that I am thus
put to deathe. For one of these two
muste needes folowe, that eyther thys
death wyll take awaye all sence from
me, or els, if my soule do continue, it
shall depart into an other place of rest.
Wherefore, yf my sense shall be ertyncte,
and my death resemble sleepe,
whyche often wythout anye trouble of
dreames, doth brynge a man most quiete
reste, (O Lorde) what pleasure shal
deathe be to me? or what daye should I
preferre afore such a nyght? the whych
wythout varyaunce or chaunge, shall
kepe a continuall estate and staye for
euer. And so, who shuld be more happy
then I? But if those thynges be true
whiche are wryten, namely that death
is a departure into those regiōs, which

all they inhabite, that are departed out
of this life, then do I accoumpte my
chaūce farre better, for that, after that
I haue escaped the handes of you, whiche
syt here in place and name of iudges,
I shall then come to them whiche
are the true iudges, Minos, Rhadamā
thus, Aecus, and Triptolemus, & shall
there haue the companye and communication
of them whych haue liued vpryghtly
in the faythe and feare of god.
This oughte to seeme a sweete pilgrymage.
But to talke wyth those worthy
men, Orpheus, Museus, Homere, Hesiodus,
or suche other learned sages,
lord howe much I do esteeme. Assuredlye,
if it mighte be, I would often dye,
inespecially, if I thought I should find
those thinges which I nowe speake of.
What pleasure shall it be to me, when
I shall commen wyth Palamedes, or
Aiar, which were of vnrightuous iudges
wrongfully put to death? I should
there see the wyt of the chyefe prynce,
which led the power of Grece to Troy
walles, and in lykewyse the wysedome
of Ulisses, and Sisyph
                     •
                  s, neyther yet

should I for the searche of such thinges
as I here am, so there also wrongfully
be put to death. And ye O iust iudges,
whyche haue heretofore quitted me,
feare ye not deathe. For no harme can
happen to a good man, neyther in thys
lyfe nor after. For the gods aboue, wil
not ceasse alwaies to haue him and his
in theyr protection. For this selfe same
death, comes not to me by chaunce, but
by the iust iudgement and appoyntmēt
of god. And for that cause I am not angrye
wyth my accusers, but onelye for
that they thoughte, that thereby they
dyd hurte me, whereas I do esteme nothinge
more then it. But nowe it is
tyme (quod he) that I departe hence to
dye, and you to liue. Of the whych two
which is the better, the immortal gods
knowe, & no mortall man as I thinke.
Now truly, I had farre rather to haue
so stoute a stomake, and well disposed
minde, then all theyr worship & welth,
that gaue sentence of his life & death.
               Albeit, that whyche he sayeth, that no
man but onely the gods knowe, yet he
him selfe doth knowe, that is to wit,

which is better of lyfe or death. For he
had vttered it in his former wordes.
               But he kepeth his olde wonte euen to
the death: whyche was, to affyrme no
certayntye of any thinge. But let vs
stand stiffely herein, that nothinge can
be euell whyche nature hath prouided
for all men: and therwithall consider,
that if death be an euell, it is a contynuall
and euerlasting euell. For it seemeth,
that deathe is the ende of euerye
wretched and carefull lyfe. Nowe if
death it selfe be myserable, what ende
can there be of miserye? But what do
I here rehearce Socrates, and Theramenes,
men of notable constantye and
wysedome? synce a certayne Lacedemonian,
a man of no reporte or fame,
dyd so muche despyse death, that when
he beynge condemned, and ledde to his
death, dyd smyle and laughe. And one
of his accusers, seeinge it, sayde vnto
him: doest then mocke and despyse the
lawes of Lycurgus? No (quod he) but
I geue him ryght hartye thankes, that
he appoincted me such a fine, as I may
paye wythout anye chaunge or lone of

money. A man assuredlye worthye, of
the name of the ryghte famous countreye
of Sparta. whose stoute courage
doth well declare (as me seemeth) that
he was vnryghtfullye put to death.

worthy to be wondred at (think
you?) whom whē Lisimachus the king
threatened, that he would hange hym,
you myght haue spoken that (quod he)
to haue feared your nyce courtyers.
               But as for Theodorus, he lytle passeth
whether he rotte aboue ground or vnder.

By whose sayenge, I am put in
minde, to speake somewhat at this present
of buryal. Which shal be nothing
hard, presupposyng those thinges to be
true, whiche we haue afore spoken of
not feelinge. And of this, what Socrates
thought, it appeareth in that booke
in the whiche his death is described: of
the whyche we haue made mention afore.
For after that he had reasoned of
the immortality of the soule, and now
his death drewe on, beyng demaunded
of Crito, howe he would be buryed, he
lookyng towardes them that stoode about
him, spake these wordes. My frē
                  des
(quod he) I haue spent much labour
in vayne. For I haue not perswaded
my frende Crito, that I shall departe
hence, and leaue nothing behinde me,
that is mine owne. But trulye Crito,
yf euer thou canst come by me, or euer
get me, burye me as thou lyste. But I
knowe righte well, that when I am
hence departed, none of you all wil solowe
me. Wyselye spoken. For he dyd
both permit his friende, to satisfye his
minde, and yet neuerthelesse shewed,

that he litle past of any such thing. Diogenes
more rechelessely, yet wittely
inoughe, but with small ciuilitye, as a
doggyshe philosopher, wylled them to
cast his bodye abrode, wythout buryal.
And when his frendes asked him, whether
he would then haue his bodye deuoured
of byrdes and beastes?. No not
so sayeth he. For I pray you set a staffe
nye to me, that I maye dryue theym awaye.
And when they asked him howe
he could do so, inasmuche as he shoulde
haue no sence after death? What hurte
shall I haue then (quod he) of the bytynge
of beastes, and peckynge of byrdes,
when I feele it not? But Anaxagoras
spake wisely, who when he was
lykelye to dye at Lampsacus, and his
frendes demaunded of him, whether if
he should chaūce to die there: he would
be caryed to Clazomena, to his owne
countrey, it nedeth not (quod he) for frō
euery place, there is like distāce of way
to heauen and hell. Wherfore as concernyng
buryall, we must knowe this,
that it perteyneth to the bodye onlye,
whether the soule dye or lyue. And in

the bodye it is playne, that after the
soule is once departed, there remaineth
no sense. But see howe full the worlde
is of errour. It is wrytten, that Achilles
drewe Hectors deade bodye at a
cartes tayle. I thinke he thoughte that
he felte the gratynge of his limmes.
And therfore he bragges of it, as if ther
by he were reuenged. But Hectors mother
lamenteth it as a most cruell facte
with these wordes.

                     I sawe, I sawe, that greued me most

And in such sorte Enni
                     •
                  s bryngeth in
Thyestes, cursynge his brother Atreus:
fyrst desyring that he might perishe
by shipwracke. That was hard surely.
For suche death can not be wythoute
gret payne. But that, that foloweth is
to to vayne.

                     I would that he him selfe were stuck
vpon some rocke.
                     His bowels out, his bloudbulcke all
to broke,
                     And pyked stones on whych he thus
doth lye
                     With goared bloud in redde hue he
may dye.
                  
               
               And such other like. Assuredlye the stones
them selues could be no more voyd
of sense, then his dead body hangynge
vpon them, to whom he wysheth thys
torment. Which although it were crueli
if he coulde feele it, yet nowe is t
                     •
                  
none effecte, because he can haue no
sence thereof. In lyke maner vayne is
that whych
                     •
                   foloweth.

                     Let him haue no graue where he his
corse may shroude.
                     Ne where his wearyed ghoste maye

take his last abode.
                  
               
               Do you see in what errour this felowe
is. He thinketh that the graue is the
harber and reste of the bodye. Trulye
there was a greate faulte in Pelops,
that he taughte his sonne no better,
howe muche he ought to esteeme buryall.
But what should I here recken vp
the opinions of euerye seuerall man,
synce we may see the manifest errours
of manye nations, as concernynge buryall.
The Egiptians spyce the deade
bodyes, and keepe theym in theyr houses.
The Persians sere theyr bodyes in
waxe, and then spyce theym, that they
may abyde as longe as may be. There
is a custome amonges the wyse men
of Chaldee, not to engraue the dead bodies,
afore suche time, as they be torne
of beastes. In Hircania, they keepe
commen dogges, such as be noble mē,
houndes, and the commen people rascall
curres, euerye man accordinge to
his abilitie, that eate them when they
be deade, and that do they counte the
best buryall. Chrisippus, hath wryten
manye sundry fashyons as concerning

the same matter: as he is a man verye
diligent, in the readynge of historyes.
But some of theym be so cruell, and so
muche agaynste nature, that my pen
abhorres to endite theym. Wherfore
as concerning buryall, we oughte not
much to force it: neyther yet oure frendes
to neglecte it: so that alwayes we
keepe this opinion, that the bodyes of
the deade, care for nothing. But what
men oughte to doe, for customes and
good names sake, that our frēdes that
ouerlyue vs muste see to: so that they
knowe, that it nothinge pertayneth to
suche as are deade. But then trulye,
death is most welcome vnto vs, when
our lyfe beyng well nye at the wane,
can comforte it selfe wyth his owne
prayses. For no man hathe lyued to
small a whyle, which whiles he lyued,
dyd lyue vertuouslye. I my selfe haue
manye iuste occasyons of death, which
I woulde to god, I myghte haue pu
                     •
                  
in execution. For there is nothynge
that I dyd desyre more. For I wanted
nothyng. I had plenty of worship,

so that euer after, I did looke for warre
and battaile wyth fortune. Wherfore,
if reason will not moue vs, to despyse
death, yet let our lyfe forepassed do it:
when we thinke we haue deserued sufficient
prayse and glory. For although
oure sense be paste, when we are once
deade, yet neuerthelesse we do not wāt
the due reward of glorye and fame, for
those thinges, whych we haue done in
oure lyues. For although glorye of it
selfe hath no cause, why it should be desyred,
yet neuerthelesse, it alwayes foloweth
vertue, as the shade of the same
But as for the wronge iudgemente of
the commen people, as I count it a cō
                  mēdable
thing to haue theyr good wil,
so I thinke, no man can be the happyer
for attayninge the same. Yet can I
not thinke, that Licurgus or Solon
shall at any time want the gloryous report
that they deserued, for makyng ci
                  
                     •
                  ile
lawes: or that the memorye of the
warlike prowes of Themistocles, and
Epaminundas shal at any time be forgotten.
For, the sea shal soner ouerwhelme
y• Ile it selfe of Salamine, thē
                  
it shall drenche the remembraunce, of
the Salamine triumphe. And ye towne
of Leuctra in Boeotia, shal soner be rased,
then the remembraūce of the fielde
there foughte, forgotten. So neyther
time can duske the prayse of Curius,
Fabritius, Calatinus, the two Scipions,
the two Affricanes, Maximus,
Marcellus, Paulus, Cato, Lelius, and
diuerse other: whose due prayse, who so
euer measureth, not by y• vaine iudgement
of the commen sorte, but by the
sure meaterodde of wysedome, he vndoubtedlye
would, (if necessity so dryue
him) with a stoute stomake go vnto the
death: in the whiche there is eyther the
chiefest ioye that may be, or at the least
wyse no euell. Yea and such a man wil
gladly dye in his chiefe prosperity. For
vnto a wyse mā a huge heape of goods
can not be so pleasaunte, as the departure
from the same shalbe ioyfull. To
this entent may we apply the sayenge
of a certayne wyse man of Lacedemon
who, (when one Diagoras, a noble
man of the citye of Rhodes) had bothe
bene him selfe conquerour at the game

pus, and also the selfe same daye hadde
seene both his sonnes conquerours at
the same) came to the old man, & sayde.
Dye nowe O Diagoras: for thou shalt
not be taken vp quycke into heauen.
               It was counted a great thyng in those
dayes, among the Grecians, to see thre
men of one house winne the games
in the mount Olimpus: & for yt cause,
he willed him hauing gottē such prosperity,
to abide no lōger in his life, subiect
to ye casualtie of fortune. But now
I thinke, I haue sufficiētly aunswered
you, with these fewe wordes, since y• it
is playne, y• suche as are dead are in no
miserye. But I haue taried somewhat
the more, in talkinge of it, because that
that is one of the greatest cōfortes in al
our lamētaciōs & mourninges. For we
oughte not to muche to require other
mens sorow as concerning our selues,
least we may seme to fauour our selues
more then it becometh vs. And yt suspicion
vexeth vs most, when we thinke y•
our frendes, whō we haue loste, are in
such misery as the cōmon people think
& that not without payne. This folishe
opinion I minde vtterly to roote out, &

therfore perhaps was somewhat longer,
thē otherwise I wold.
            
            
               Hea.
               what?
do you cōplayne of being to long? I assure
you it semed not so to me. For the
first part of your talke made me not vn
willinge to die. But the last made me
euē to c
                     ••
                  et death. So y• by al your reasoning,
I am fully perswaded to count
death no euel.
            
            
               Mar.
               Do you thē loke for
a conclusion after the maner of ye Rhetoriciās,
or els shal we here breake of?
            
            
               Hea.
               No not so. For I long to hear you
in y• art, which you alwayes set forth,
or rather (if we will say y• truth) it sets
forth you. And therfore I praye you let
vs heare ye conclusiō.
            
            
               Mar.
               Diuers men
are wont to alledge in the scooles, the
iudgementes of the gods thē selues, as
cōcerning death. And those not of their
owne heades, but cōfirmed wt the aucthority
of Herodotus, and other more.
First they tell of Cleobs & Biton, the
sonnes of Argia, the prieste. The historie
is cōmen. whē she should haue bene
caried in a wagon to a certaine solēpne
sacrifice a good space from the towne,
& the horses were tired, the .ii. yong mē
                  
                     •
                  hich I named euen nowe, putting of

theyr garmentes, annoynted theyr bodies
with oyle, & came to the waggō,
and drewe it. The pryest, when by this
sort she beinge drawen of her sonnes,
was come to the place of sacrafyce,
prayed the goddesse, that in reward of
theyr godly reuerence, she would gyue
to her two sonnes the greatest reward
y• god myght gyue to man. Her prayer
beinge finished, the yonge men after
they had dined, laye downe to sleepe,
and in the morninge were found dead.
The lyke is reported of Trophonius,
and Agamedes. Who after they had
buylte to Apollo a temple at Delphos,
desyred of him as great a rewarde as
any man might haue. To whō Apollo
answered, y• they should haue theyr request,
thre dayes thence. nowe as soone
as the thyrd daye came, they saye, that
they were both found deade. So they
say, that god (yea and that god to whō
all the rest of the gods yelde in prophecye)
shewed hereby, that death was the
best thing that any man might wyshe.
There is also an historye of Silenus,
who beinge taken prisoner of kynge

Midas, payed this raūsome. He taught
the kynge, that the best thing y• myght
chaūce to a mā, was neuer to be borne:
the nexte to dye as soone as might be.
The which sentence Euripides hathe
e
                     •
                  pressed in verses in his tragedye entituled
Cresphon.

                     It wel behoues vs to lamēt the birth
of euery man
                     Yf we the daungers of this life and
present perilles skanne.
                     But when triumphante death hath
ryd him once from those.
                     Then ought his frendes no more to
waile but mery to reioyce.
                  
               
               There is the like, in the booke of consolation,
of Crantor. For he saieth that
one Psichomantius, meting with one
Elisius, who much lamēted the death
of his childe, gaue him three such verses
writen in a table.

                     O mortall men with ignoraunce
howe much be you deceyued?
                     For this mans sonne reioyces nowe
this mortall lyfe bereaued
                     Thou eke were wel if so thy lyfe the
fatall wightes had weaued.
                  
               
               
                  
With these and such like authorities,
they cōfirme this cause to be adiudged
by the immortall gods. Alcidamus an
auncient oratour, a man of great fame
wrote in commendacion of death: who
lacked the weighty reasons of philosophie,
but had plenty of wordes inough
But the notable deathes, whiche men
suffer for their countreye, seeme to the
rhetoricians, not only glorious, but also
blessed. They rehearse Erictheus,
whose doughters suffered voluntarye
death, to saue the life of theyr citesins.
And Codrus, who willingly entred in
the mids of his ennemies in the armor
of a commen souldiour, to thintēt that
he mighte not be knowen to be kynge.
Because there was an oracle geuen,
that if the king were flayne, thē should
the Athenienses haue the victory. Neither
do thei ouerpasse Menecheus, who
hauing the like oracle giuen, bestowed
his bloud for his countrey. Iphigenia
also, was willinge to be slayne at Aulide,
that by her bloud, her countreymē
might more easely sheade the the bloud
of theyr ennemies. Then they come

nigher. They remember Harmodius,
and Aristogiton, Leonidas also the Lacedemonian,
& Epaminūdas the Theban.
They knowe not our countreymen,
whom it would aske great tyme
to recken, there be so manye, to whom
we knowe that glorious death was alwaye
welcome. Which inasmuche as
it is so, I must nedes wishe, that either
men would hereafter desyre deathe, or
at the least wise, ceasse to feare it. For
if at the last daye of our lyfe, our soules
dye not, but onely chaunge their place,
what ought we more to wyshe? But if
death do vtterlye destroye vs, what can
be better, then in the rage of great stormes,
swetely to slumber? and after that
a man hath nodded oute of this lyfe, to
sleepe euerlastingly. Which if it be so,
then oughte we rather to allowe the
wordes of Ennius, thē Solan, for Ennius
sayde.

                     Let no man me bemoane, ne moyst
                           •
                        
my graue with teares.
                  
But the other.

                     Let not my death want teares, al ye
my frendes do wepe.
                     
                        
And ye that erst aliue me loued with
teares my funeral kepe.
                  
               
               But we, if so be it happen, that by the
commaundemente of god we must depart
out of this life, let vs do it merely
thanking him for it. And let vs thinke,
that thereby we are loosed from prison
and eased of the irons, with the whych
we were clogged, either to depart into
perpetuall mansion house appoynted
for vs, or els to be voyde of the sense of
all griefe. And afore such time, that we
shall be called of god, let vs thinke that
day which is so terrible to other, to be
a blessed and a happye daye to vs. Because
it is appointed, either of the gods
immortall, or els of nature, the firste
framer and maker of all thynges. For
we were not firste made by happe, or
chaunce, but by a certayne heauenlye
power, whych will prouide for vs, and
not create anye of vs, to the ende, that
when we had passed the miserye of
this lyfe, we should fall into the euerlasting
darkenes of death. But let vs
rather thinke, that deathe is a safe hauen,
and baye for vs, to the whyche I

praye god we maye come, wyth spedye
wynde and say
                     •
                  e. But althoughe for a
while we may be kept of by a contrary
tempeste, yet neuerthelesse, we must
needes come to it at length. And can
that, whyche must needes come to all
men, be misery to any one? Thus you
haue nowe my conclusion, so that you
can not iustly complayne of any thing.
            
            
               Hea.
               You say well, and truly this conclusion
hath strengthned me more, thē
I was before.
            
            
               Mar.
               I am glad of it.
But nowe let vs see somewhat to our
owne ease. And this nexte daye, and so
long, as we shall abide in thys my manor,
we will talke of those thinges
chiefely, whiche pertayne to the
ease of griefe of the minde,
feare and desire, which is
the most profite of al
philosophy.

             THE SECOND BOOKE
treating of the second question
whyche Marke Tullye Cicero
disputed in his manor of Tusculanum,
concerninge payne and
forment, howe farre it is the
dutye of a wyse man to
suffer the same.
            
               
                  NEoptolemus, in
Ennius sayeth, y•
he must of necessitye
practise philosophy.
But yet neuerthelesse,
but in
fewe thinges: for
vniuersally it likes him not. And I truly
(O Brutus) must nedes vse philosophy
(for wherein may I better employe
my time of leasure?) But I can not limite
it to a fewe thinges onlye, as he
doth. For it is very harde, that a man
should be any thing skilfull in philosophy,
wythout the knoweledge of moste
thinges, or all. For a man cā not chose

a fewe thinges, but out of a great nū
               ber:
and it is not possible, that he which
hath gotten a litle knoweledge, should
not with earnest desire study, to knowe
the rest. But neuerthelesse, in a busye
lyfe, and (as Neoptolemus then was)
much troubled with warre, both a litle
is profitable, and turnes to muche vse:
(But yet not suche as may be gathered
of all Philosophye) and yet suche neuerthelesse,
as we maye thereby be eased,
of desire, care, and feare. As bi that
disputacion, which we kept last in oure
manor of Tusculanum, we seeme to
haue wrought a great despyte of death
whiche is of no litle force to ease oure
mind of feare. For who soeuer feareth
that, whyche by no meanes maye be auoyded,
he surely, can not by any possibilitye,
enioye the fruyctes of a quyete
life. But who soeuer (not onely because
he must needes dye, but also because
there is nothing in death to be feared)
doth not passe on death, he assuredlye,
hath gotten him selfe a strong staye, for
a quyet lyfe. Although I am not ignoraunt,
that many will speake agaynste

it: whose vayne reproche I could by no
meanes anoyde, vnlesse I should write
nothing at al. For if in myne oracions,
in the whiche I somewhat esteeme the
fauour of the people (for that rethoryke
is an arte appliable to the cōmen voyce
of the people, & the verye ende and perfection
of eloquence, is the prayse and
commendacion of the hearers.) If then
I saye there were some, whiche would
like nothinge in my oracions, in the
wittes, they them selues were not likely
to passet and would extend their commendacion
in other mens workes no
further, then they thought their owne
whyche mighte well attayne the same:
and for that cause when any other mā passed
them in weyght of sentence and
eloquence of wordes, woulde saye, that
they lyked rather a thinne and base
then so plentifull a stile (of the whyche
sorte also they were, that were called
Attici, who boasted the profession of
that, whyche no man els knewe, who
nowe are almost laughed out of al courtes).
If then in the allowynge of mine
orations the people were of seuerall

mindes, what maner of hearer (thinke
you) shall I in this grauer matter
haue of the same? For philosophy sekes
not the iudgement or prayse of manye,
but of purpose flyes the preace of the
commē people, of whom it is alwayes
eyther feared, or hated. So that, if eyther
any man lyst to disprayse it wholye,
he may do it wyth the good will of
the people, or els if he will chiefely dyscommend
that, whych we nowe treate
of, he maye haue sufficiente ayde out of
the bookes of other philosophers. But
we haue aunswered all the foes of philosophye,
in oure booke entituled Hortensius,
and whatsoeuer was to be spoken
in the defence of Plato & his secte,
called Academia, we haue expressed in
our .iiii. bookes entitled Academikes.
            But yet neuertheles, so much it lackes
y• I would be angry or displeased, if any
man should write against the same,
y• I wishe it euen with all my hert. For
philosophy in Greece it selfe, had neuer
come to suche perfection, vnlesse there
had bene suche contention, and diuersytye
amonges the best learned men,

as concerninge the same. Wherfore I
desyre all suche as are able to do it, that
they woulde helpe to take this prayse
also from Greece, that is already faynted,
and bring it into this our citye, as
our auncesters haue already done by al
the rest, that were worth any payne or
trauayle. And truly, the prayse of Oratoures
encreased from a lowe to suche
perfectiō, that nowe (as natures course
doth worke in all thinges) it beginneth
to waxe aged, and within this shorte
space is lykely to come to nought.
            Wherfore, nowe let philosophy, begin
to be spred in the latine tongue: and let
vs helpe the encrease thereof, altho
                  •
               gh
that for the same we be reproued and
refuted. Which trulye they can not abyde,
which bynde them selues to a
                  •
               ye
certayne opinion, as men wholye gyuen
to the same, so that sumtimes they
are constrayned, to get theym opinion
of constancie, to maynteyne such thynges,
as otherwyse they woulde not allowe.
But I who in al thinges folowe
probabilitie, and can go no farther thē
likelyhode, am readye both to wryte agaynst

others without any stubbernes
and also to be writen agaynst, without
anye anger. If so we maye brynge this
kinde of exercise, from the Grecians to
our countreymen, we shall not wante
the helpe of the Greke libraries, which
are stuffed with an iufinite company of
bookes, wryten of the same matter.
            For manye haue wrytten the same in
effect that some others haue done afore
them. So that the noumber of bookes
is infinite. The which shal in likewise
happen to vs, when many geue theym
selues to wrytynge. But I will assaye
chiefelye to prouoke thē to write, who
being wel learned, and instructed with
perfect eloquence, can endyte philosophye
with a good trade and order. For
there is a certayne sort of men, whych
wyll needes be counted philosophers,
that are reported to haue wryten manye
latine bookes, whiche surelye I do
not despise, because I neuer redde thē:
but inasmuche as the aucthours them
selues, do playnely confesse, y• they can
wryte neyther distinctlye, orderlye, eloquently,
nor trimlye, I assuredlye neglect

the readyng of that, which shoulde
nothynge at all delyght me, inasmuche
as they care not, what they wryte: I
knowe not why anye man shoulde be
bounde to reade thē, but suche as ar
                  •
                of
the same opinion that they be. For as
all men reade Plato, and the workes
of other, scolers of Socrates, & so likewyse
of others, that were taughte of
them, although they agree not in opinion
wyth them, or at the least wise do
not greatly alowe them, but Epicurus
and Metrodorus none almost handles,
but suche as be of theyr owne secte, so
these late latine wryters they onelye
reade, which thinke the same to be wel
and wysely wryten. But me semeth,
that whatsoeuer any man would set abrode,
ought afore to be commended by
the iudgement of suche as are learned.
And for that cause, the aunciēt custome
peripatecian and academias, to reason
on eyther parte of euery question, doth
maruaylously well like me: not onelye
for that by no other meanes the truth
                  •
               
of euerye doubtefull question might be

tryed, but also because there is in it a
greate exercyse and practyse of Rhetorique:
whych Aristotle chiefly vsed, and
all they that folowed him. But in this
our time, Phil
                  •
                (whom we haue herd)
appoynted one tyme to teache the preceptes
of Rhetorique, and an other to
declare the rules of philosophy. To the
whyche order I beynge lykewyse moued
of my familyar fryendes, spente
there in suche leasure as I had in my
maner of Tusculanum. Wherfore
when I had spent the morninge in the
studye of Rhetoryke, after noone we
came downe to our scoole: in the which
such reasoninge as we had. I do nowe
expresse: not as if I tolde it, but euen in
maner wyth the selfe same wordes, as
it was done. Therfore whyles we walked,
we fell into this talke.
            
               Hea.
               I can
not well expresse howe muche I was
delyghted, or rather strengthened with
your yesterdayes reasonynge. For although
I am assured, that I was at no
time to muche desyrous of my lyfe,
yet neuerthelesse there woulde come

come sometime both feare and gryefe,
to my heart, when I thoughte, that I
should one day lose the fruition of this
pleasaunt light, and eke of all the commodities
of this life. Of this trouble
assuredly, I am nowe so eased, that I
care for nothinge lesse.
            
            
               Mar.
               It is no
maruayle truly. For such is the effecte
of philosophye: it helpeth the minde, it
taketh a way all vayne care, riddes the
mind of desyre, and driues away feare:
but this her power is not of like force
wyth all men. But then it worketh
most, when it chaunceth on a good nature.
For stoute men not onely fortune
doth helpe (as the olde prouerbe is) but
much more reason. Whiche in maner
wyth certayne preceptes, confyrmeth
the strengh of fortitude. Nature fyrste
made you hye minded, and meete to despise
all earthlye thinges, and for that
cause, in your stoute stomake', the perswasion
of sufferynge death is lyghtly
rooted. But thinke you, that these selfe
same perswasions, do so much preuaile
wyth them (except very fewe) of whom
they were first inuented, reasoned, and

written? No truly. For howe manye
philosophers shall you finde, whose life
and behaui
                     •
                  ur is such as reason requireth?
Or that doth vse theyr teachynge
not as a brag and boastinge of knoweledge,
but as the law and order of good
life? Or howe manye of theym shall ye
fynde, that are ruled by theym selues,
or obeye theyr owne decrees? you shall
see some of such lyghtnes, and arrogā
                  cie,
that it had bene better for them, neuer
to haue learned. Some other couetous
men: many verye desyrous of glorye:
and moste of them s
                     •
                  aues of pleasure.
So that, theyr talke and their life
seemes meruaylously to differ, whiche
assuredlye, seemes to me a thyng worthye
great reproche. For like as if one
that did professe grāmer, should speake
false latine, or one that would be counted
a musician should sing out of tune,
his fault were so muche the worse, because
it is in that kynde of knowledge
which he professeth: so lykewyse, a philosopher
shewing yll example of liuing
is so muche the more to be blamed, as
he offēdeth in that thing, of the which

he professeth him selfe a teacher, and
professinge the arte of lyfe, offendeth in
his liuinge.
            
            
               Hea.
               Is it not then to be
feared least you commend philosophy
                     •
                  
wythout a cause? For what can be a
greater proofe, that it is not auaylable
then that diuers notable philosophers
do lyue abhominably?
            
            
               Mar.
               Truly it is
no proofe at all. For as all fieldes that
are tilled are not fruitefull, and it was
falsely sayde.

                     Although the fruitefull seede in barren
grounde be cast.
                     Yet it at length wil there take roote
and so come vp at last.
                  
               
               So not all the mindes that are sowen
with the seede of philosophy, do brynge
fruyte therof. And that I maye persyste
in the same similitude, as the grounde
be it neuer so fruytefull, yet wythoute
tilling can not be fruytfull, so neyther
can our minde wythout learnyng. For
Philosophy is the plough of the mynd,
whose share cuts vp all vyce by the rootes,
and prepares our minds to receiue

the seedes of vertue: and so at laste soweth
the same in it, whyche in due
tyme yelde mooste plentyfull encrease.
But let vs nowe go forewarde, saye
what so euer you are wylling to heare
dyscussed.
            
            
               Hearer.
               I thynke that

am ashamed to be so soone trypped in
my talke.

youre former opynion. For what

shame, vyce, and dyshonestye? whyche

to coueyte, and desyre?
            
            
               Hearer.
               I
thynke so lykewyse. But yet although
gryefe be not the chyefest euell, yet
assuredlye it is an euell.

               I do

               Fyrst then, I wil speake of the weakenes

                  tie, Aristippus the scoler of Socrates,
doubted not to saye, that griefe
is the greatest euel that might happen
to man. This nice and effeminate opinion,
Epicurus was verye readye t
                     •
                  
take: and after him one Hierome a
Rhodiā sayd, that to want griefe, was
the greatest good that myghte be. So
much euell he thought was in sorowe.
And diuers other, except Zeno, Aristo,
and Pyrrho, were of the same opinion.
            
            
               Hea.
               But what thynke you?
            
            
               Mar.
               That it is an euell in deede. But

neuerthelesse that there are other far

worse then it. For that which both nature
it selfe, and also all stoute courage

doth deny, I meane that you should not
counte griefe the greatest euell that
myght be, but that shame didde farre
passe the same) that also philosophy the
maistresse and lady of our life doth still
mayntayne. For what dutye, what
prayse, what ho
                     •
                  esty, will he so muche
esteeme, that he will put his bodye to
payne for the attayninge of the same,
who thynketh gryefe to be the chyefest
euell? And what shame, what dishonesty
would not a man suffer to escape
gryefe, yf he thoughte it to be the greatest
miserie? To conclude, who is there
not wretched, not onely then, when he
is oppressed with payne, if griefe be so
miserable, but also in asmuche as he
knoweth it may happē vnto him? For
who is there to whō it can not chaūce?
So hereof it must needes folowe, that
none at all can be blessed. Metrodorus
truly thynkes him to be happy, whose
bodye is in good health, and is assured,
that it shall be so for euer. But who is
he, that can promise him selfe any such
assuraunce. Nowe Epicurus opinion
is suche, that I thinke he inuented it

purposelye to moue men to laughter.
               He affyrmeth in a certayne place, that
yf a wyse man be burnt, if he be vexed,
yet he will beare it, and not yelde vnto
it. A great prayse surelye, and worthye
of Hercules him selfe. But yet neuerthelesse,
this will not suffyce Epicurus
a hard and a stoute man (god wot).
               For he albeit he were in Phalaris bul,
will saye, o howe pleasaunt is it? howe
litle do I care for it? yea it is euē sweete
to me. Why is it not inough, if it seme
not bitter? For they truly them selues,
that saye that gryefe if no euell, are
not wont to saye, that torment is pleasaunt
to any man. But that it is sharp
hard, hatefull and agaynst nature: and
yet neuerthelesse no euell. And he that
thynketh this onely to be euel, yea and
the extremest of all euels, thinkes that
a wyse man will count it pleasaunt. I
do not requyre you to terme griefe so
lightly, as Epicurus (a man wholy giuen
to pleasure) doth. Let him saye on
gods name, that it were alone to him,
to be in phalaris bull, and in a softe fetherbed:
I do not requyre in a wise mā
                  
so great pacience agaynst gryefe. If he
be able to perfourme his dutye in suffering
it, I do not requyre him to be glad
of it. For vndoubtedly, it is a heauye
thyng, sharpe, bitter, enemy to nature,
hard to beare, and suffer. For see Philocteta,
whom we muste gyue leaue to
mourne. For he had seene Hercules afore
in the hill O
                     •
                  ta roarynge, because
of the greatnes of the griefe that he suffered.
The arowes that he afore tyme
had receyued of Hercules, coulde then
be no ease to his smart, when the vaynes
of his inwarde 
                     •
                  owelles, infected
with adders poyson put him to bytter
gryefe, causinge him to call for helpe,
and desyre death in this wyse.

                     O what man nowe within the seas
would drench my wretched corps.
                     Or who would beate my bloudy braynes
about the boysterous rockes.
                     Howe wretchedly I here consume? the
poyson wastes my life.
                     I woulde to God that some good man

               As yet you haue pleaded my part.
But thereof we wil talke hereafter.
               But in the meane time, I maruayle
much what you meane by vsynge verses
so muche in your talke?
            
            
               Mar.
               I will
tell you the cause, and it is well asked
of you, since you see that I am nowe at
leasure. I thinke when you were in Athenes,
you haue bene often ere nowe,
in the scooles of the philosophers.
            
            
               Hea.
               Yea truly, and that very gladly.

                  us.
               Did you not then marke, that

they did much vse to bryng in verses in
theyr talke.
            
            
               Hea.
               In deede I remember
that Dionisius the Stoyke brought in
very many.
            
            
               Mar.
               You say trouth. But
he did it withoute anye choyce or eloquence.
But Philo both kept the number
of his verse, and vsed choyse therin
and placed them also conueniently.
               Wherfore since the time that I fyrste
fell in loue with this declamation of
mine olde age, I doe gladly brynge in
my talke the verses of our poetes. And
if they chaunce to be imperfecte in any
poynct, I haue translated the same out
of the Greeke: because I woulde not,
that our tongue should want any kind
of ornament that the Greekes had.
               But do you see the discommoditie that
Poetes cause? Fyrst they bring in stout
men lamenting, which weakeneth the
readers courage. Then they be so pleasaunt,
that men do not onlye read thē,
but also learne them wythout booke.
               So, when to litle learninge, and to a
wanton and effeminate life, poetes are
once adioyned, they vtterly slake all the
prickes of vertue. And for that cause,

they are worthelye banished of Plato,
out of that cicie, whiche he framed as
the most perfect forme of a well framed
and gouerned common welth.
               Yet neuerthelesse, we beinge learned
so to do of the Grecians, do both reade
theym euen from oure youthe vpwardes,
and also learne theym withoute
booke: thinkinge their learninge to be
both good & honest. But what shoulde
we blame Poetes? since there haue ben
philos
                     •
                  phers, who ought to haue bene
the maysters of all vertue, which haue
thoughte sorowe & gryefe to haue bene
the greatest euell: and whereas you being
but a yonge man, and euen nowe
of the selfe same opinion, with thys
onely demaund, whether it were greater
then shame, did foorthwyth relente
and forsake your vaine opinion: Now
                     •
                  
aske Epicurus the same question, and
he will say, that small griefe is a greater
euell, then the greatest shame that
maye be. For he wyll saye, that shame
is no euell, vnlesse gryefe do folowe.
               I meruayle then, that there dothe no
gryefe folowe Epicurus, when he sayeth

that gryefe is the greatest euell:
whyche is the moste shamefull thinge,
that any Philosopher myght haue spoken.
Wherfore you did well aunswere
when you sayde, that shame seemed to
you a greater euell then gryefe. And if
you will persiste in that opinion, you
shall lyghtly perceyue, howe much we
ought to auoyde griefe. For we must
not so muche searche, whether gryefe
it selfe be an euell yea or no, as howe
we oughte to strengthen oure myndes
to beare the same. The Stoykes occupye
them selues in certayne light reasons
to shewe the cause whye it oughte
not to be called an euell. As if the controuersie
were of the worde, and not of
the matter. Whye doest thou deceyue
me Zeno? For when thou denyest that
gryefe and formente (whyche seeme to
me horrible thinges) are any payne at
al: I am strayght delyghted therewyth
and become desirous to knowe, howe y•
whiche I esteeme the greatest miserye,
can be counted no euel at all. There is
nothing euel (sayeth he) but y• which is
dishoneste or vicious. Nowe y• tryflest.

For that which greued me moste, thou
leauest vntouched. I knowe that paine
and gryefe is no sinne. Ceasse therfore
to tell me of that. Teache me, whether
it be any thing materiall to sorowe, or
not sorowe. Nothing at al (thou sayest)
as cōcerning a blessed life, which consisteth
in onelye vertue. But yet neuerthelesse
it is not to be vsed, but left: and
why so? Because it is sharpe agaynste
nature, payneful to suffer, heauye and
hard. Here is plenty of wordes in dede
and yet neuerthelesse, all this in effecte
is no more but euell. And by thys varietee
of wordes, thou doste descrybe
and defyne vnto me, what gryefe is,
and not howe I shoulde rid my selfe of
it. Thou callest it sharpe, repugnaunt
to nature, scarce able to be borne, neyther
dost thou lye therein. But thou
shouldest not haue vsed suche copye in
wordes, and faynted in matter. As to
saye, that nothinge can be good, that is
not honest, nor nothinge ill that is not
dishonest: that is to wyshe a thinge as
it shoulde be, and not to teache it as it
is. But that was said much better and

truer, that all thinges whiche nature
doth abhorre are euell: and contrarye
wyse, suche thinges as it coueytes are
good. This foundation beinge placed,
and all contention about wordes set a
parte, yet neuerthelesse, that selfe same
thynge whyche the Stoikes so muche
esteeme, whych we call honesty, right,
and comelines, and whiche we sometimes
compryse vnder the name of vertue,
shall so muche passe all other, that
the goodes of the bodye and fortune,
may well seeme ryght small in comparison
of it. Wherfore, if (as you graunted
at the beginninge) shame is worse
then payne, then trulye is payne nothinge
at all. For when thou shalte
thinke it a shame, for one that woulde
be counted a man, to groane, crye, lament,
and bewaile, thē shalt thou haue
afore thine eyes, the beautye of stoutenes
& honesty. According to the which,
as longe as thou shalte rule thy selfe,
thou shalt vndoubtedlye perceyue, that
gryefe wil yelde & giue place to vertue.
For where so euer vertue is, there is
no feare of gryefe. For fyrst as for pru-without

the whiche a man can not so
much as vnderstand any other vertue.
Will she suffer the to do anie thyng or
attayne to any profyte, withoute laboure
or trauayle? Will temperaunce
suffer the to do anye thinge, wythoute
moderation? And iustyce what man
can obserue, that for feare of payne
would dysclose secretes, that were told
him, betraye his frendes, or ouerpasse
many other dutyes of a iust man?
               But inespeciallye, what wilt thou answere
to fortitude and her mates, stoutnes
of stomacke, grauity, patience, and
despysyng of al worldly thinges? what
wilt thou lie like a miser, complaining
lamentablye, to thintente to heare
some other call the a stoute man?
               Nowe assuredlye, one in that case, no
man would esteeme to be a man.
               Wherfore, either we must despise mā
                  lye
courage, or els bury griefe. What?
know you not this, that although, you
loose one iuell, yet the residue of your
substaunce may be safe? But if you lose
one vertue (but vertue can not be lost)
or if you confesse that you lacke one,

you must nedes lacke all? Maye we thē
call Philocteta afore mentioned, a
stoute man, or a man of great courage,
or a pacient or a graue man? For I had
rather to haue your indgement therein
then mine owne. But he trulye can be
no stoute man, who li

                  th in a warme
bed and yet
With cries complaintes and sighes,
doth cause the aer resound.
               
               I do not denye payne to be a gryefe:
for then, what nede should we haue of
fortitude? But I saye, that it ought to
be ouercome wyth pacience, and sufferaunce,
if there be any such thing. But
if there be none such, then whye do we
in vayne commende Philosophye? or
what meane we so muche to bragge of
the workes of the same Doth gryefe

The lawes of the Cretenses, whyche
eyther Iupiter him selfe made, or elles
Minos at the commaundement of Iupiter
(as the Poetes saye) and so lykewyse
the lawes of Licurgus, do commaund,
that youth should be broughte
vp in labour, huntynge, running, hunger,
thirste, colde, and heate. And the
boyes of Sparta, at the aultars, are so
laded with stripes, that ofte times a
greate deale of bloude gusheth oute of
theyr bodyes: yea and sometimes (as it
was tolde me, whē I was in that countrey)
euen to the death. Yet of them all
not one, did at any time not onelye not
crye, but neyther so muche as groane.
Why thē, may childrē suffer so much,
& mē nothing? or shall custome so much
preuayle, and reason nothinge? There
is a difference betwixt labour & griefe,
yet neuerthelesse, they are verye nyghe
in nature. But they differ somewhat.
For labour is the exercise of the minde
or bodye, in some busye worke or trauayle.
But gryefe is a sharpe motion
in the bodye, contrary to the senses.
               These both, ye Grecians, whose tongue

is more plentifull then oures do confound
vnder one name. Therfore, painfull
men they name desyrous and louers
of gryefe. But we, much more
aptelye, call theym paynefull. For it is
one thing to labour, and an other to be
gryeued. O Greece, sometimes yet barren
of wordes, with the whiche thou
thinkest thy selfe chiefelye to flowe. I
saye, there is great diuersitye betwyxt
gryefe and laboure. It was a gryefe to
Caius Marius, whē the vaynes in his
thigh were cut. But it was a laboure
for him, when in a whote day, he marched
afore his armie. Yet neuerthelesse
there is some affinitye betwixte these.
For the vse and custome of labour, causeth
griefe to be more easy to be borne.
And for that cause, they whiche fyrste
gaue lawes to the commen wealth of
Greece, commaunded inespecially that
yonge man should be acquaynted with
trauayle: whiche the Lacedemonians
applied in likewise to their women.
               Who (whereas in other cities they sit
shaded wythin the walles of their houses
clothed in nice apparell) liued there

nothing after that sort. For they more
desired to wrestle, to bathe them selues
in the riuer Eurotas, to abide the heat
of the sonne, duste, trauayle, and warfare,
then to syt ydle and beare childrē.
And among these paynefull exercyses,
griefe must sometimes be entermedled
For they are some times beaten, striken,
and cast downe. But custome it
selfe doth euen harden them from feeling
the gryefe. But nowe as for warfare
(I talke not of the Spartans, who
vse to marche in measure accordinge to
the blaste of the trumpet) but oure armies,
fyrst you see are called exercitus,
of exercise: then, what or howe greate
laboure doe they en
                     •
                  ure, in bearynge
eche man a halfe monethes vitayle,
or any other thing that they shall haue
neede to vse? For as for the caryage of
theyr tergate, sworde, or helme, they
counte it no greater burden, then of
theyr shoulders, legges or armes. For
they saye, that harnesse is the handes
of a souldyoure. Whyche they carye so
muche wythout anie combraunce, that

yf neede should be, they casting awaye
theyr other caryage, myghte vse they
                     •
                  
weapons as theyr limmes. What? the
exercisinge of our souldyours? the runnyng,
coupling, and shouting of them,
what payne is it? Thereby theyr courage
is made so r
                     •
                  ady, to abide blowes
in the feilde. Brynge thyther a freshe
water souldyoure, albeit he haue as
good a stomake as the other, yet he wil
seeme a woman in comparison. Why?
such dyfference is there betwyxt newe
commers, and olde beaten souldiours,
as we haue sufficiently proued. The
strengthe of the yonger souldioures is
commonly better. But to take paines,
and to set noughte by woundes, that
custome teacheth. Also we maye dyuers
times see, when they being wounded,
are borne out of the fyelde, that a
yonge and rawe souldioure, hauynge a
small blowe wyll weepe like a childe:
But the olde beaten warryoure beyng
hardned 
                     •
                  y continuaunce, will but call
for a Surgyan to binde vp his woundes.

                     
                     He sayes Patrocles here I come you
                           •
                        
gentle aide to craue:
                     Afore I dye the doleful death which
                           •
                        
enmies sword me gaue:
                     For loe my bloud out of my wounde
in wonderous wise doth runne:
                     Wherfore assaye if by your helpe the
death I nowe may shunne.
                     For both Aesclapius childrens hals
are full of wounded men.
                     So that by no meanes anye accesse I
nowe may haue to them.
                  
               
               This is Euripylus. You maye well
perceyue him to be a man muche exercised
in warre. For where is his longe
lamentacion? See howe stoutly he talketh,
yea and shewes a reason, why he
ought to take it in good part.

                     Who so doth mind, his 
                           •
                        oe in warre
with deadly 
                           •
                        int to strike:
                     Let him firste thinke, that thother
doth for him prouide the like.
                  
               
               Truly if Patrocles had bene a man,
he woulde haue borne him into his
chaumber, and bound vp his woundes
but he did nothinge lesse, for he enquyreth,
howe the fyeld was fought.

                     
Tell me quod he, in what case nowe
the Grecians state doth stand.
               
               He is not able to expresse the same so
well in wordes, as by shewinge the tokens
whiche appeared on him. Ceasse
therfore, to aske him anye more questions
(O Patrocles) and bynde vp his
woūdes. For although Euripylus can
abide the gryefe, yet Aesopus can not.
Who after he described Hectors fatall
chaunce, weping lamentateth the ruinous
state of the Troians, in great sorowe
and anguishe. So impacient is a
stoute man sometimes, for the losse of
glory in the fielde. Well: shall an olde
souldiour be able, by continuaunce and
custome to do these thinges? and a wel
learned and wise man not? Nowe trulye
he ought to do it farre better. But
as yet I speake of the custome of e
                     •
                  ercise,
and not of reason and wysedome.
Olde women very ofte will beare honger
.ii. or .iii. dayes. Take away meate
but one daye, from one of these stoute

                     •
                  yghters: he will crie out vpon Iupiter
him selfe, & saye he is not able to bears
it. Custome is of great force. For we

see, that hunters lye all nyghte on the
snowe, and in the day are parched with
the sonne, rebounding from the hilles.
Thereof it cometh also, that maysters
of fence and champions stirre not for a
drye blowe. But what do I here talke
of theym, who stryue for games as it
were for the office of the consulshippe?
these ruffins, and other desperate persons,
what blowes beare they? And
wherof commeth it, that suche as haue
bene well broughte vp, 
                     •
                  ad rather receyue
punishement iustly deserued, thē
by shame to auoyde it? Howe manye
proofes haue we of some, that esteeme
nothinge more, then to please eyther
theyr maysters or els the people. Yea,
and of some, who when they haue bene
almost stayne, haue sente to theyr maysters,
to knowe theyr pleasure: sayeng,
that if theyr wyil be so be
                     •
                  te, they are
euen readye to dye. What so meane a
champion, did at any time groane at a
stroke: or els so much as ones chaung
                     •
                  
his countenaunce? Who of theym, did
not onlye stand in fyght, but eyther dye
with shame? Who of them, being commaunded

to laie his head on the blocke
to be striken of wyth an axe, did at any
time shrinke in his necke? Suche is the
force of exercise, vse, and custome. Shal
a Samnite then, a filthy man, worthy
of so beastly a life, be able to abide these
thinges, and shal a man well broughte
vp, and euen framed to obtayne glory,
haue any parte of his minde so effeminate,
which with exercise and wit he
can not fortifye? The syght of the fence
players, seemeth to manye men meruaylous
cruell: and I can not well say,
whether it be so or no, as it is nowe a
dayes vsed. But trulye I thynke, that
when condemned persōs did fight oute
theyr lyues, as there myghte be some
better enstructions for the eares, to
teache men to despyse gryefe, so assuredlye,
to proue the same, and euen to
set it before oure eyes, I thinke there
could be none better. Thus muche I
haue spoken of the exercise, custome,
and practyse of gryefe. But nowe let
vs consider the reasons agaynste the
same, vnlesse you haue anye thynge

thinge to saye agaynst that, whyche is
alreadye spoken.
            
            
               Hea.
               What that I
shoulde trouble you in youre talke? No
surelye, I will not. Youre reasons so
muche moue me to credyte you.
            
            
               Mar.
               Whether gryefe be any euell or
no, that let the Stoikes weygh: who
wyth farre fette and trifelinge conclusions,
in the whiche the sense of man
hath no iudgement, assaye to conclude,
that gryefe is no euell. But I (what so
euer thing it be) thinke assuredlye, that
it is not so great as it semeth, and that
men are more afrayed, with the outward
apparaunce and shewe of it, then
they neede. And to be shorte, that there
is no paynes in it, but that is very tollerable.
Whence therfore were it best
for me to beginne? shall I bryefelye repeate
those thinges whyche I haue alreadye
spoken, that my talke maye the
better proceede in order? This therfore
all men graunt, aswell learned as vnlearned,
that it is the parte of couragious,
stoute harted, and valiaunt men,
paciently to beare griefe. Neither was
there anye man, who would not count

him worthye great prayse, that coulde
suffer the same. That therfore, whych
is both necessarilye requyred of stoute
men, and also counted prayse worthy
                     •
                  
when it is done, that I saye, eyther to
feare when it is comminge, or els not
to beare when it doth come, is it not a
great shame? And whereas al the good
affections of the minde, are properlye
called vertues, it seemeth to me, that
that name, doth most properly belonge
to that onely, which doth farre passe all
the reste. Nowe the name of vertue, is
deryued of the name of man, whiche in
latine is vir. To whō the vertue that
doth most properlie belong, and appertayne,
is fortitude and stoute courage.
The two chiefest poyntes of the which
are the contempte of death, and despysyng
of griefe. These therfore we must
vse, if we wil be counted the obtayners
of vertue, or rather thoughte worthye
of the name of men: because of this
worde (vir) whiche in latine sygnifyeth
this worde man) the name of vertue is
taken. But perchaunce, thou wilt aske
me, howe shoulde I beare griefe? And

not without good cause. For philosophye
professeth also a medecine for the
same. But nowe comes Epicurus, a
man not very euel, or rather good, and
giueth counsell according to his wyt.
               Passe not for gryefe, sayeth he. Who
sayeth so? euen he, which co

In deede I despyse the greatnes of such
griefe▪ from which, the shortnes of the
time shall deliuer me, well nie afore it
come. But if it be such, as the payne of
Philocte
                     ••
                   was▪ it seemes to me to be
great ynoughe, althoughe it be not the
greatest. For when no part of my body

                  es, but my foote: yet mine eyes may,
so may my head, sides, lightes, and other
partes of my bodye. And although

this be not the greatest gryefe, because
I feele not gryefe in all those partes,
in the whyche I mighte, is it therefore
no payne? But continual gryefe (sayes
he) hath more mirth then sorowe.
               Nowe trulye, I can not well 
                     〈◊〉
                   that
so learned a man wantes wit. But assuredlye,
I thinke, he speakes it in derision
of vs. I cal it the greatest griefe,
althoughe some other be ten moates
more then it. And thinke not, because
that some other is greater then it, that
for that cause it should be foorthwyth
small & light. I can name manye good
men, which these manye yeares, haue
bene troubled wyth extreame paynes
of the goute. And shall we thinke theyr
paynes small, because they might haue
some greater? But he like a suttel man
appoyntes neyther any measure of the
quantitie, or greatnes, ne yet of ye lēgth
of griefe. So that I cā not know what
he thinketh to be greatest in gryefe, or
what to be short in time. Wherfore let
vs ouerpasse him, whose wordes are to
none effecte: and let vs playnelye confesse,
that we ought not to seke remedy
of our payne at his handes, which sayd

that gryefe was the greatest of all euels:
althoughe he him selfe in his dysease
of strāgurye, seemes to shewe him
selfe some what stoute. We must then
seeke helpe otherwhere: but chiefely (if
we desyre to know, what is most mete
for vs to doe) at their handes, whyche
thinke that whiche is honest, to be the
chiefest good: and contrarywyse, that
whych is dishonest, to be the principall
euell. In theyr presence trulye, thou
durste not syghe, nor yet to bragge of
such trifles. For vertue it selfe, by their
voyce will commen with the, in this
sort. Wilt thou (seeing children in Lacedemon,
yonge men in the games of
the mounte Olimpus, and barbarous
bondmen in the liftes, abidinge moste
bitter strokes, yea and that wythout anye
noyse of crye) If any lyghte griefe
chaunce to touch the, schriche out forthwyth
like a woman? Wilt thou not abide
it constantly, & quietely? thou wilt
saye, it can not be suffered: my nature
wil not beare it. I heare the. Children
beare it: some for prayse, some to auoyd
shame, and some for feare: and are we

afrayd, least that which so many men,
in so many diuers places haue suffered
our nature wil not beare? But it truly
wil not only beare it, but also requires
it. For there is nothinge that it dothe
more esteeme, neyther yet anye thynge
that it doth more coueyt, then honesty,
then prayse, then dignitie, then worship.
By these diuers names, I meane
but one thinge. But I vse thē to shewe
the thing more euidently by many names.
But my meaninge is this, that
that thing, is farre aboue al other most
conuenient for eche man, whiche is to
be desyred for it selfe: as a thing eyther
issuynge out of vertue, or els beynge it
selfe placed amonges some one of the
vertues, and of his owne nature praise
worthy. Which trulie, I would rather
terme the singuler and onelye, then the
chiefest or greatest good. And as these
thinges may be truly verified of hones
                     •
                  ye,
so may the contrary aswell be spoken
of dishonesty, then the which there
is nothing more filthye, nothing more
to d
                     •
                   abhorred, nothing more vnmeete
or vnsemely for a man. Whiche if you

be alreadye persuaded (for you sayde at
the beginning, that you thought there
was more euell in shame and dishonestye,
then in any gryefe) then you maye
well ynough be your owne mayster.
               Howbeit I do not well knowe howe a
man maye vnderstande that phrase of
speache, of beinge your owne mayster,
as though one part should rule, & thother
obeye. Yet neuerthelesse, it is not
spoken vnaduisedly. For our minde is
diuided into two partes: of the which,
the one is endued with reason, and the
other is wholy voyd of ye same. Wherfore,
when we are cōmaunded to rule
oure selues, this is the effecte thereof,
y• we ought by reason to rule rashenes.
There is in all mennes mindes some
softnes, wantonnes, and faintnes, and
truly, if there were nothinge els, there
were nothinge worse then man. But
euen with the sam
                     •
                  , we haue reasō, the
mistresse, & quene of all thinges geuen
vnto vs, which by her owne endeuour
& 
                     •
                  arder encrease, is made perfecte vertue.
That this may gouerne that part
of the minde, which ought to be subiect

& obedient vnto it, that is the charge &
dutye of euerye good man. Perchaunce
thou wilt saye, howe shall it rule the other?
euen as the mayster doth his seruaunt,
the captaine his souldioure, or
the father his sonne. For if that frayle
part of our mind, behaue it selfe dishonestly,
if it geue it selfe effeminately to
teares, and mourninge, let it be faste
bounde, and committed to the ward of
his neighbour reason. For often times
we see some afrayd of shame, whom otherwise
reason could not moue. Such
therfore as seruaūtes, ought to be kept
within the bandes of feare. But suche
as are somewhat strōger, & yet not fully
fortified, those we ought by often admonicion
to put in remembraunce, of
theyr owne good name. See howe the
wisest man in Greece, being wounded
lamenteth not vnreasonably but moderately
rather, sayeng.
Go softely sirs, least otherwise, you
cause my gryefe encrease.

                     Nowe sure Ulixes, though we see

               The wyse poete thought, that custome
ought to haue bene no small enstructor
to him to beare gryefe. And he trulye
lamenteth not immoderately in extreme
gryefe sayeng.

                     O hold me: staye me nowe: and helpe
by arte to staunche my bloud:
                     Lay bare my woūdes: for griefe doth
cause me now to ware nye wood.

                     Away depart and get you hence; and
leaue me here alone.
                     For why, my paine doth more encrease
through your great noyse & moane.
                  
               
               See you howe sodainely not the griefe
of his body was appeased, but the rage
of his minde repressed? And therfore in

the laste verses he chideth others, euen
when he was dieng with these wordes

                     On fortune we may wel complayne,
but yet not well lament.
                     For why, the firste beseemes a man,
the last is womens poynt.
                  
               
               Loe, the weaker parte of this mans
minde, was so obediente to reason, as
an olde souldiour should be to his capitayne.
That man in the which perfect
wysedome may be found (whych truly
we neuer see, but yet neuerthelesse
knowe by the wrytinges of Philosophers,
what maner man he shall be, if
there shall at anye time rise any suche)
he truly, or els reason for him (whyche
shall shewe her perfect force, and beare
her full stroke in him) shall so rule and
gouerne that inferiour part, as a good
father should his obedient children.
               He shall do wyth his commaundemēt,
what soeuer he list, wythout any paine
or griefe. He will strengthen, fortifye,
defende, and arme him selfe, to wythstand
gryefe, as his deadly enemye.
               But what be those weapons wyth the
whych he shall so furnyshe him selfe?
               
                  
The inward talke, and communicatiō
of his heart: when he is willing to flye
all dishonestye, fayntnes, and all other
thinges, not seemelye for a man. Let
him also haue alwayes afore his eyes,
the pure examples and pictures of honesty.
Let him beholde Zeno the philosopher
of Eleas: who 
                     •
                  hose to suffer all
kyndes of tormente, rather then he
would vtter such, as were priuie to the
conspiracie, to destroy the tirantes. Let
him thinke of Anaxarchus Democritius,
who beyng fallen into the handes
of Nicocreon, the kynge of Cipres, forsoke
and refused no kynde of punyshement.
Calanus an indian, and vnlearned
and barberous man, borne at the
foote of the hil Caucasus, did voluntarilye
suffer him selfe to be burnt. And
we, if our feete, our teeth, or al our bodye
chaunce to ake, are not able to abide
it. For we haue a fond and lyghte
opinion, the whiche procedeth not so
muche of gryefe, as of to muche pleasure,
by the whiche when we are once
made nice, and beginne to abounde in
wantonnes, we can not so muche as abide

the stynge of a bee, wythout great
outcries. But Caius Marius a man
alwayes bred in the countrey, but neuerthelesse
a man in deede, when he
was cut as I haue shewed afore, forbid
theym to binde him. Neyther was
there any man afore him cut vnbound.
But many since: and whye so? because
they folowed his example. Do you not
then perceyue, that we thinke griefe to
be a greater euell then it is in deede?
               And yet neuerthelesse, that it was a
gryefe vnto him, he him selfe doth sufficientlye
shewe. For he would not let
hys other thyghe to be cut. So he did
both beare the payne like a stout man,
and also like a wise man, refused to suffer
more then was nedeful. This matter
therfore, chiefelye consisteth in rulyng
your selfe. But what kind of rule
that must be, I haue already shewed.
               And truly this cōsideracion whē a mā
weyghes, what thinges are worthy to
be suffered, for the name of pacience, a
stout stomake, & a hauty courage, doth
not onely restrayne the mind frō doing
amisse, but also (I knowe not howe)

doth greatly asswage the gryefe it selfe
For as we see in the fyelde, when a cowarde
and fearefull souldioure, at the
fyrst sight of his enemy casting awaye
his armoure, flyes asmuche as he can,
thereby sometimes comes to his destruction,
whereas he that abode in the
field, felt no suche chaunce: so they that
can not abide the fyrst brunt of sorowe
do cast away them selues, and lye some
sore vexed, and other some mad, wheras
they that wythstoode it, do often tymes
depart, hauing the vpper hand.
               For there be some thinges, in the whiche
our mynde dothe resemble our bodye.
For as oure bodyes are the better
able to beare burdens, whē we stretche
out our limmes, and setle our selues to
abide the weyghte thereof, and contraryewyse
when we haue no courage to
it, an easye burden ouerlades our lasye
limmes: so likewyse, our mind hauing
an earnest attētiue desire to any thing,
can lightly caste of the weyghte of anye
burden troubling it from the same.
               But if it once slacke his good will, it is
to kept downe, & depressed by the same,

that it can neuer after rayse it selfe againe.
And (if we wil say that which is
truth) in the execution of all such thinges,
as appertayne to our dutye, there
oughte to be an earnest and zelous desyre
of our minde, whiche is the onelye
mayntayner and preseruer of all dutyes.
But this chiefely we must prouide
in the sufferyng of all gryefe, that
we do nothinge fearefully, cowardlye,
slauishely, or effeminatelye: and aboue
all other thinges, that we vtterlye reiect
suche lamentable complayntes, as
Philocteta made. To sygh and groane
maye be well graunted and permitted
to a man: but to crye out, not so mcuhe
as to a woman. For, suche mourninge
the lawe of the .xii. tables forbiddeth anye
man to vse in funeralles. Neyther
trulye, wyll a stoute or wyse man, at any
time so much as syghe, vnlesse it be
to setle him selfe more strongly, for the
abidinge of gryefe. As runners sometimes
in their race, crye as loude as
they can. So do the wrestlers in theyr
exercyse, and the champions, euen whē
they lift theyr clubbes to strike at their

aduersaryes, vse to groane. Not for
that they feele any payne, or that theyr
heart faynteth them, but because with
theyr lo
                     •
                  de shoute, the strengthe of
theyr bodye is pulled togyther, and so
there commeth a sorer strype. So, they
that are mynded to crye very loud, are
not contented to applye thereto theyr
sydes, tounge, and iawes, whiche are
the instrumentes of the whiche the
sounde of our voyce is caused, but that
also wyth theyr hole bodye, and euerye
parte of the same, they assaye to poure
out theyr voyce. Trulye I sawe when
Marcus Antonius pleadynge verye
earnestlye for him selfe, touched the
ground wyth his knee. For, as stone
bowes, and other gunnes, that shoote
out stoanes, and arowes, cast so muche
the faster, as they be stiffer bente, and
drawen more hardlye: so oure voyce,
runnynge, or stroke, is so muche the
greater, as it proceedeth from the earnest
endeuoure of the whole bodye, beinge
bent to nothinge els sauynge that
onely. The whiche earnest good wyll,
since it is of suche force and power, i
                     •
                  
                  
suche syghynge in the sufferynge of
gryefe, as proceedeth from the same, be
to the confirmation and strengthening
of oure courage, suche I thynke best
that we vse. But as for the lamentable,
weake, abiecte and wofull crye, to
that I saye, who so euer shall giue him
selfe, him surely, would I scarse thinke
worthye the name of a man. Which if
it did bryng anye ease to his payne, yet
were it the parte of him to consyder,
what were the dutye of a stoute and
couragyous man. But synce it asswageth
no parte of our smart, why should
we shewe oure selues lewde wythoute
anye cause? For what is more fonde
then to weepe lyke a woman? And
this precepte, whyche we nowe gyue
of gryefe, extendeth further. For all
suche thynges, as we ought to auoyde,
we must wythstande wyth as earnest
desyre and affection, as we oughte
gryefe it selfe. For if we burne wyth
anger, or frye wyth the flames of lust,
we must runne to the same fort, & take
the same weapōs to wythstand it. But
since our purpose here is to entreate of

gryefe, we wil ouerpasse those thinge
                     •
                  
To beare gryefe therfore quietelye and
pacientlye, it is necessarilye expedient,
that we haue our hole entent fyxed on
the honestye of the thinge, wherfore
we suffer it. For we are of nature (as I
sayde before (howebeit I must remember
it oftener) very desyrous of honesty▪
the glimse of the whyche, if we once
chaunce to see, there is nothinge that
we be not ready eyther to beare, or suffer,
for the obtayning of the same. Frō
this earnest desire, that our mind hath
to get true prayse, and honestye, procede
the aduenturing of so many daungers,
in the battell, so that stoute men
do eyther not feele their woundes, or
els if they do feele them, yet had rather
to dye, the
                     •
                   to lose one iote of their worshippe.
Both the Deci
                     •
                   sawe the glistering
swordes of theyr enemyes, when
they voluntarilye ranne vpon them.
               The nobility and glory of theyr death,
did take from thē all the feare of woundes.
Do you thinke that it greued Epaminundas,
whē he felt his lyfe to faint
euen as his bloud wasted? no truly.
               
                  
For he lefte his countrey rulinge ouer
the Lacedemonians, to whom whē he
came first to office, they were bonde
and slaues. These be the cōfortes and
eases of the greatest griefes, that may
be. But thou wilt saye, what comforte
maye they haue whiche are payned at
home in peace, oute of warres in theyr
quyete beds? Nowe thou bryngest me
to philosophers, which come not often
into the field: emonge the whiche one
Dionisius borne at Heraclea, a vayne
and a light man, learninge these same
enstructions of Zeno, to be stoute against
griefe, was afterwardes neuerthelesse
ouercome of the same. For hauing
a payne in the raines of his backe
in his greatest gryefe he cryed out, that
all those thinges were false whiche he
had learned afore as concerning griefe
Whom, when Cleanthes his scoolefelowe
demaunded, what reason had
moued him to chaunge his opinion, he
aūswered: because (sayes he) if I should
spend all my time in Philosophye, and
not be able to beare gryefe, it were a
sufficient proofe, that it is an euell.
               
                  
But I haue spente a great number of
yeares in philosophye, and can not neuerthelesse
abyde gryefe, it must nedes
therefore be euell. Then Cleanthes
hearing this, striking the ground with
his foote, rehearsed this verse.
Doest tho
                        •
                      heare this Amphiara
                        •
                     s
ygraued in the ground.
               
               By Amphiara
                     •
                  s he ment Zeno, from
whom he was sorye to heare him so degenerate.
But farre otherwise dyd our
countrey man Possidonius, whome I
my selfe haue often sene, and of whom
I wyll tell you, what Pompeius was
wont to remember. Which was, that
when he departing out of Siria, came
to Rhodes, he would gladli haue heard
Possidonius. But vnderstanding that
he was greuouslye sicke, wyth an ache
in all his limmes, & that for that cause,
he coulde not heare him dispute, yet he
thought good to see the noble philosopher.
To whose presence whē he came
and had honourablye saluted him, sayenge
that it grieued him verye muche,
that he could not heare him reason of
philosophye, at that present: you maye

very well, yf you please (quod he) for I
wil neuer suffer, that a litle ache of my
bodye, shoulde cause the iourney of so
noble a man, to be taken in vayne. So
Pompeius told me, that he lyeng, reasoned
verye sagelye and eloquentlye of
this position, that nothing is good but
that whiche is honest. And when the
thornes of gryefe would nowe and thē
pricke him, he woulde often saye, all
this is to no ende O griefe: for be thou
neuer so troublesome vnto me, yet wil
I neuer confesse the to be euell.
               So all noble and renoumed laboures,
euen wyth despysynge of theym are
made tollerable. Do we not see in the
scooles of fence, that suche as esteeme
the prayse of the same, passe for no
payne, so they maye attayne it? Lykewyse,
those, whome the prayse of huntynge
and rydynge the horse doth more
delyghte, do they refuse anye payne,
in learninge the same? What shall I
speake of oure ambition for offyces,
for greedye desyre of honoures?
               What fyre is there, throughe whiche
they woulde not runne that sue for the

same, wyth tooth and nayle, as a man
would saye. Africanus had alwayes in
his handes Xenophon the scoler of Socrates,
whom amonges all other thinges,
he chiefelye praysed for this sayenge,
that the selfe same laboure, was
not alike greuous to the capitaine, and
to the souldiour. Because the honoure
makes the capitaynes labour but light
But it chaunceth commonlye, that amonges
the commen sort of fooles, the
opinion of honesty is of some force, but
it it selfe they can not discerne: and for
that cause, they are muche moued with
commen reporte and iudgement of the
multitude, and so thinke that onelye to
be honest, whych most men commend.
But I would not wyshe you, although
you be in the fauour of the cōmen people,
yet to stande to theyr iudgement:
neyther to esteeme that best which they
do. You must vse your owne discrecion
and iudgement. If you like your owne
iudgement in esteeminge such thinges
as be honest, you shall not onely be able
to rule your selfe, (as I sayd somewhat
a
                     •
                  ore) but all other men and all other

thinges likewyse. Wherefore propose
to your selfe a certayne stoutenes, and
highenes of stomake, which is of great
force to cause a man to contemne and
despyse all gryefes. Thinke also, that
there is but one thinge which is moste
beautifull of al other, and that so much
the more, if it wante the prayse of the
people, and not looking for it, doth delyghte
it selfe wyth his owne commodityes.
Truly all suche thinges as are
done wythout boasting, or commendation
of the people, seeme to me more
prayseworthy then the contrarye. Not
for that I woulde haue suche thinges
done out of the face of the people (for al
honest deedes loue to be placed in the
light) But, because there is no greater
prayse that vertue requyreth, then the
good iudgement of a sounde and vndefiled
conscience. And let vs chiefelye
thinke, that this sufferaunce of griefe,
whiche we haue sayd often heretofore,
ought to be strengthened with the earnest
desyre of the minde, oughte to be
equally and indifferentlye shewed and
applyed in all cases. For many whyche

eyther for desyre of conqueste and dictorye,
or couetyse of glory, haue stoutelye
abyden manye cruell strokes, yet
neuerthelesse sometimes the selfe same
men, are not able to abyde the paynes
of a dissease. For the cause is, for that
that payne whiche they suffred afore,
they suffred not learned by the guyde
and conductynge of reason, or wysedome,
but onelye for desyre of glorye.
               And for that cause many rude and barbarous
people, can stoutely weld theyr
weapons, and yet neuerthelesse can
not behaue theym selues manlye, in
theyr disease. But the Grecians being
men not verye stoute, but wyse inough
(as the wyttes of men are diuerse) can
not behaue them selues stoutly against
theyr enemyes, and yet neuerthelesse
can beare disseases pacientlye, and as
it becometh men. And the Cimbrians
and Celtiberians, are stoute in the
field, and playne women in their sickenes.
For, nothing can haue any equalitye
or measure in it, whych dothe not
proceede of reason. And when you see

them, whom eyther earneste desyre, or
els a vayne opinion moueth to coueyte
anye thynge, in folowynge and attayninge
the same, not to be wearyed of
gryefe, then oughte you to thinke, that
gryefe is eyther no euell at all, or els if
there be anye hardenes in it, or anye
thinge contrary to nature, and for that
cause it may please you to call it euell,
yet neuerthelesse, that it is so litle, and
so muche ouercome of vertue, that it
can not appeare at all. Whiche I beseche
you ponder wyth your selfe. For
this reason wyll serue you to manye
more vses, then to auoyde gryefe. For
if we must referre all oure doynges to
the auoydinge of dishon
                     •
                  stye, then we
shall not onelye neede to despyse the
pryckes of sorowe, but y• thunderboltes
of flatterynge fortune also. Speciallye
inasmuch as at our laste ende, there is
that hauen and porte prepared for vs,
of the whyche we reasoned the daye
before: namelye death. For, lyke as yf
God woulde saye, to a sayler persecuted
wyth Pyrates, cast thy selfe ouer

the shyp borde, for there is a Dolphine
which will beare the (as he did Arion)
or els the horse whiche drawe Neptunus
chaire vpon the seas, shal be ready
to receyue the, & carye the whether so
euer thou list. Woulde not then this
mariner (thinke you) abandone feare?
So, when the sharpenes of gryefe doth
vexe vs, if it be suche that we can not
beare it, you see where is our refuge.
               Thus much I thought good to speake
at this presente. But I thinke you do
still persist in your former opinion.
            
            
               Hea.
               No trulye, for by these two dayes
reasoninges, I hope that I am eased of
those two thinges, which I did chiefelye
of all other feare.
            
            
               Mar.
               To morowe
we wyll measure our talke by the clock
But I thinke, that you can not be
at leasure.
            
            
               Hea.
               Yes trulye,
euen before diner this selfe
same time.
            
            
               Mar.
               So we
wil do, & satisfy (as I
trust) your earnest
desyre.
            
            Finis.
         
         
            
            THE THYRD BOOKE
contayning the third Question
disputed by Marke Tully Cicero
in his thyrd daies reasoning, in
his manour of Tusculanum,
treatinge howe a wise man
ought to behaue him selfe
in sorowe and griefe
of mynde.
            
               WHat might I thinke
the cause to be (deare
frende Brutus) that
whereas we consiste
both of soule and bodye,
there is an arte
inuented for the preseruation
and health
of the bodye, and it also so muche esteemed,
that the inuention thereof▪ is fathered
on the immortall goddes. But
the cure of the soule, was neyther so
much desyred afore it was founde, nor
greatly frequēted after it was knowē,
neyther scarse wel accepted nor alowed

of some men, but rather suspected and
hated of the moste? maye this be the
cause, for that the griefe and disease of
the bodye, we may iudge by our mind,
but the gryefe of oure minde, we can
not discerne by our body? and so it hapneth,
that oure minde then iudgeth of
it selfe, when ye
               ▪ wherewyth it iudgeth
is sicke? For trulye, if nature had made
vs suche at the fyrste, that we mighte
playn
                  •
               ly behold and perceyue her force
and vnder her most sure guide and conduite
passe the course of oure life, then
needed we not to requyre the helpe eyther
of reasō or learning. But she hath
geuen vs onelye certayne small spar
               
                  •
               les,
which with noughtye fashions 
                  •
               
erronious opinions we doe lyghtelye
quenche, in such wise, that not so much
as any glymse of the lyghte of nature
can appeare. For ther are sowen within
vs, the seedes of vertue, whyche i
                  •
               
they might encrease and growe to ripenes,
would of theyr owne nature with
out any other aide, bring vs to the blessed
& immortall life: but nowe as soone
as we are borne & brought foorth into

this light we are forthwith continuallye
trayned in al noughtinesse and peruerse
opinions, so that it maye well be
sayd, that euen with the milke of oure
nurses, we do sucke errour. And when
from theym we are committed to oure
second parētes (our maisters I meane)
we are then seasone
                  •
                wyth so manye
lyes, that truth yeldeth to vanitie, and
the enstructiōs of nature, to y• strength
of false opinions. Hereunto also are
poetes adioyned: who, for y• they haue
an outward shewe of learning & wisedome,
are heard, read, & learned, and so
are fullye fastened in our mindes. But
when to this same we ioyne the people
also, as a wise teacher, and the commē
voice of the multitude, the confirmer
of al vice, then are we altogither infected
with erronious opinions, & swar
                  ••
               
wholy frō the rule of nature. So y• those
whych teache vs that nothing is more
necessary, more to be desired, or coueted
then honour, empire & the praise of the
cōmon people, seeme in teaching vs so
cōtrary doctrines to ye enstructiōs of nature
to haue enuied vs ye fruictō of those

most excellente principles, whyche she
at the fyrst had engraffed in vs. Al men
neuerthelesse do greedelye desyre the
prayse of the commen sorte, and suinge
therein after true and vnfayned honesty
(which onely, nature in al her workes
doth propose as an ende) are foulye
deluded and mocked. For they do not
obtayne any perfect picture of vertue,
but ye shaded image of glorye. For, true
glorye is a sounde and perfect thynge,
and no coloured shadowe. And that is
the incorrupted and vniuersall prayse,
of al good men, proceeding of the right
report of the excellencie of vertue.
            Whyche trulye is in maner the eccho
of vertue. For it alwayes aunswereth
to the sound of the same. Which in asmuch
as cōmonly it foloweth all good
deedes, is not to be refused nor despysed
of suche, as are good men. But it
which will needes be an imitatour of
the same (the commen brute of the people
I meane) is often time rashe, vnaduised,
and most commonly a commender
of vice, and naughtines, and vnder
the shape of honestie, stayneth the

forme and beauty of vnfayned glorye.
Wyth the ignoraunce of the whyche
mens mindes beynge blynded, and coueting
alwayes to do some fact, wherby
they myghte be renowmed, knoweinge
not neuerthelesse, howe or whych
waye they might per
                  •
               ourme the same,
haue fallen into great inconuenience.
For some haue rased theyr owne cities
and some haue slayne them selues.
            And so they seekynge thynges that are
of thē selues good, are deceyued, not so
much of a set purpose, as because of the
ignoraunce of the waye, by the whych
they should come to the same. Nowe,
those whiche haue theyr mindes vexed
wyth the greedye desyre of money, or
with the filthy lust of pleasure, or they
whose mindes are so muche disquyeted
wyth the same, that they are not farre
frome madnesse (as foolishe men commonlye
are). Haue all these sortes of
men no neede of helpe thinke you? eyther
because the disseases of the minde
haue lesse neede of helpe then the sickenesses
of the bodye, or els for that there
is an arte inuented to cure the bodye,

and none to heale the soule? But trulie
the diseases of the minde are both more
deadlye, and also more in number then
those of the bodye. For they be so much
the more greuous, as they pertayne to
the mind, and the vexing thereof, whiche
being sicke, doth alwayes erre (as
Ennius sayeth) and can for griefe neyther
do, neyther suffer any thing well.
And furthermore neuer ceasseth to be
vexed with desyre: then both the which
maladies, that is to wite, griefe and desire,
what greater diseases maye there
be? And who can proue, that the soule
is not able to cure it selfe, inasmuch as
it firste inuented medicines for the bodye?
and also, whereas the healinge of
the bodyes, doth muche consyste in the
constitutiō and nature of the same, and
al mē which were contēted to be cured,
haue not bene healed, yet euery mans
mind which was willing to be healed,
and was therein ruled bi the preceptes
and counsels of wise men, hathe bene
alwayes vndoubtedlye cured. The medecine
of y• minde, is philosophy, which
helpeth vs (not as the diseases of oure

bodye are holpen) by thinges withoute
vs, but we our selues must wyth al our
power & endeuour, laboure to cure our
selues. But of philosophy vniuersally,
how much it should be eyther esteemed
or vsed I haue sufficiently spoken (as I
thinke) in my my booke entituled Hortensius.
And of other wayghtye questions,
I haue not bene slacke, eyther to
dispute or wryte. But in these bookes,
I haue endited those questions whiche
I reasoned with my familiar frendes,
in my manour of Tusculanum. And in
asmuch as in the twoo fyrste bookes,
you haue hearde oure disputacions of
death, and of the griefe of the bodye, in
this third booke you shall receyue oure
reasoning kept the third day. Therfore
when I came downe to my scoole (the
middes of the day being past) I requyred
some of thē, that were presēt, to put
foorth somewhat, whereof we myghte
reason. Then the matter fell our thus.
            
               Hea.
               I thinke y• griefe of ye mind sometimes
hapneth to a wyse man.
            
            
               Mar.
               Thinke you so likewise of ye other perturbatiōs
of ye mind, fear, lust▪ & anger?

hath any disease (vnder the name of diseases,
the philosophers comprise those
troublesome motions of the minde, as
I sayde afore) is no more hole then our
bodyes in sickenes. So it must needes
be, that wysedome is the healthe of the
soule, & follye the syckenes of the same.
Which we may call eyther madnes or
folyshenes. The whych is better expressed
in the latine wordes, thē greke.
As it chaunceth in many other termes
besydes. But therof we shall treate an
other time. Nowe let vs speake of that
we haue in hand. This therfore, wherof
we treate, what it is, the worde it
selfe doth sufficiently declare.
               For we must needes thinke theym to
be hoale, whose mind is troubled with
no motiō, in maner of disease, and such
as contraryewyse are vexed wyth the
same, to be diseased. The latine worde
of the which called Insania, doth properlye
signifye madnesse. And therfore we
vse to saye in the latine tongue, that
suche as are out of theyr wyttes, as become
fransye, eyther with luste or anger.

Although, anger it selfe is a parte
of luste: for thus it is defyned.
               Anger is the lusting affter vengeance.
They therfore, whyche are sayde to be
out of theyr wyttes, are so termed, because
they can not vse theyr wittes to
the whyche nature hath graunted the
rule of the mynde. But whye the Grecians
cal it 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , I do not wel know.
But we distinguishe the same better
then they. For this vnhealthfulnesse
which being all one in effect with foolyshenesse,
extendeth very farre, we separate
from madnesse. So the Greekes
would. But they haue no apte worde
for it. For that whyche we call madnesse,
they call Melancholian. As though
men were made frontike onelye wyth
melancholye, and not rather and more
oftē, with great anger, griefe, or feare.
as we reade that Athamans, Alcmeon,
Aiar, and Orestes, were. And in
suche case, who so euer is, hym the
the lawe of the twelue Tables, forbyddeth
to haue the vsyng of his owne
goodes. And there it is wrytten,
yf a man be (Insanus) whyche sygnifieth

vnhelthful, but if he be (Furiosu
                        •
                     )
whiche properly signifyeth madde and
furious. For by this worde (
                        •
                     nsania) they
did vnderstand, the want of a good and
perfecte disposicion. Howe be it they
thought, that a man in such case might
well accomplishe al duties, pertayning
to the commen and accustomed trade
of lyfe. But madnesse, they thoughte,
was the blyndenesse of the minde towardes
all thinges. Whiche although
it seeme to be a great deale worse, then
the vnhealthfulnesse of the minde, yet
trulye it is suche, that it maye sooner
chaunce to a wyse man, then this
lacke of healthe of the minde, I meane
folishenesse. But that is an other question.
Let vs retourne to our purpose.
You sayde (vnlesse I be deceyued) that
you thoughte, that griefe of minde
might chaunce to a wyse man.
            
            
               Hea.
               I
thinke so in deede.
            
            
               Mar.
               You doe but
like a man, in that you thinke so. For
we are not made of flynte. But there
is naturallye in vs some tender and
softe thinge, which gryefe of mind shaketh
as a storme. Neyther was it euell

sayde of Crantor, who was a man of
great reporte in oure vniuersitie. I do
not agree wyth them (quod he) who affirme
so much insensibilitye of gryefe,
which no man eyther can, or oughte to
haue. I would not gladly be sicke (quod
he) but if I be, let me feele it whether
they cut away anye deade fleshe, or els
take any thing out of my body. For to
feele nothinge at all, can not be without
great dulnesse in the mind, nor masinesse
in the bodye. But weyghe ye
wel, whether by this talke, he agree to
our infirmitie, or fauour our softenes.
Wherefore, let vs attempte to cut of,
not onely the braunches of these foolishe
miseries, but also to pull vp all
the mores of the same, by the roote.
               Yet do we the best we may: some thing
will remayne. Follye hath rooted so
deepe in mens heartes. But yet onelye
so much shall remayne as is necessarye
to be le
                     •
                  te. Wherfore, knowe you this
for a certayntie, that vnlesse our minde
be cured (whiche by no meanes can be
done wythout philosophye) we shal neuer
haue an ende of miserye. Wherefore,

knowe you this for a certayntye,
that vnlesse our minde be cured (which
by no meanes can be done without philosophye)
we shall neuer haue an ende
of miserye. Wherfore as we haue begonne,
so let vs wholy yelde our selues
to it, to be cured. We shall be healed if
we list. And I wyll goe somewhat farder.
For I will treate not of the griefe
of the minde onelye (although thereof
chiefelye) But of all the perturbations
or rather diseases of the same, as the
Greekes terme them. And firste if you
be so pleased, let vs folowe the order of
the Stoikes: who are wont, fyrste in a
shorte compasse to frame the force of
theyr argumentes. And afterwardes,
we wil talke of the same more at large
after our accustomed vse. Who so euer
is a stout man, he must nedes be bold,
but whosoeuer is bold, feareth not (for
boldenes and feare are thinges differente
in nature) But to whom so euer
gryefe of minde maye chaunce, to hym
lykewyse feare maye come). For what
                     •
                  soeuer
thinges do grieue vs when they
chaunce, the same afore they come we

feare. Therfore gryefe of the mynde, is
contrary to stoutenes of stomake.
               Furthermore it is likely, that who soeuer
may feele griefe, he must also abide
feare and faynte hartednesse, the
whyche twoo, in whom so euer they be
founde, he maye be subiecte to affections,
and must nedes confesse him selfe
ouercome wyth them. But none of all
these can happen to a stoute man.
               Therfore neyther gryefe maye. But
none can be a wyse man, vnlesse he be
stoute. Wherefore, to no wyse man,
can any gryefe happen. Furthermore,
it must needes be, that he whyche is a
stoute man, shoulde haue a hau
                     •
                  y courage:
and who so euer hath suche courage,
is inuincible of all euell motions.
And he that is so inuyncyble will
despyse all casualtyes, that may happē
to man, as thynges worse then hym
selfe. But no man despiseth those thinges,
the misse of y• which should grieue
him, but a stoute man. Whereof it is
concluded, that all stoute men are voyd
of gryefe. But in a wise man, stoutnes

is requisite. No wise man therfore can
feele gryefe. And like as a troubled eye
is not in good estate to execute his fūction,
and so likewise the other partes
of the bodye, or the whole bodye, when
it is once moued from his quiete state,
faynt
                     •
                  th in doing his parte and dutye:
so lykewyse, a troubled minde, is not
able to execu
                     •
                  ue his dutye. But the dutie
of the minde is to vse reason well:
And the mynde of a wyse man is alwayes
so disposed, that it can guyde it
selfe according to the vse of reasō. It is
then neuer troubled. But all gryefe is
a trouble to the minde. Wherefore euerye
wyse man must needes be voyde
of the same. It is likely also that euery
temperate man, whome the Greekes
call 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   and the vertue it selfe

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   whiche I am wonte to
terme temperaunce or moderance, and
sometimes modestye. But I can not
well saye, whether it may be called frugalitie,
whych the Greekes take verye
strayghtlye, who name frugall men

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   whiche signifyeth onelye
profitable. But it hath a larger sence.

For all abstinence, al innocence (which
emonges the Greekes hathe no proper
name, but maye well be called 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     .
For innocencie is suche an affection of
the minde as hurteth no man) and all
the rest of the vertues may wel be comprysed
vnder the name of frugalitye.
               Whyche if it were not so largelye taken,
but so limited as some mē thinke.
L. Piso had neuer got so great a name
for vsing of it. But because neyther he
who for feare doth forsake his garison,
(which is a point of cowardise, neither
he whiche because of couetyse doth not
restore a thing secretelye committed to
his custodye (whych is the poynt of iniurye
and wronge) neyther he whyche
through rashenes hath lost the fyelde,
(whyche is a poynt of follye) are wonte
to be called frugall. For that selfe same
cause this name frugalitye contayneth
these .iii. vertues fortitude, iustice, and
prudence. And if this be common to all
vertues, that they be all coupled & kni
                     •
                  
together amonges theym selues, then
the last and fourth vertue, frugalitye it
selfe must needes be. For it is the proper

dutye hereof, to rule and appease
the motions of a ragynge minde, and
standyng alwayes stiffe agaynst luste,
and pleasure, to keepe a moderate stedfastenes
in all deedes. The contrarye
vice to the whyche, is properlye called
naughtines: but frugality (as I think)
was so called of fruy
                     •
                  e, then the which
the earth can yelde nothing better.
               And naughtines hereof (for althoughe
it be somewhat harde to deryue it, yet
let vs assaye, and if we chaunce not to
deryue it well, let men then deeme
that we spake it merelye), because the
vse of it serues to nought in anye man
Who soeuer therefore is frugall, or
rather moderate, and temperate, he
must nedes also be constante. But he
that is constante, must be quyete. He
that is quyete, must be voyde of perturbation,
and by that meanes of gryefe
also. But all those thinges afore recited,
appertayne to a wyse man. A wise
man therefore shall want gryefe.
               And therfore Dionisius an Heraclean,
doth not vnwittely reason, against the
complaynte of Achilles, in Homere, in
this maner (as I remember)

                     
                     My hart wyth angry moode, puft vp
in wondrous wyse doth swell,
                     When I recorde from honoure hye,
and worshyppe howe I fell.
                  
               
               Is thy hand in good estate when it
swelles? or is there any of thy limmes,
whyche being swollen or p
                     •
                  ffed vp, is
not sore and yll at ease? So lykewyse, a
swelling minde is alwayes sicke. But
the minde of a wise man, is alwayes
veyde of syckenesse. It doth therefore
neuer swell. But an angry minde doth
alwayes swell. A wyse man therefore
is neuer angry. For if he be angrye, he
doth also desire: for it doth properly belonge
to an angrye man, to desyre and
wishe the greatest griefe that maye be,
to him of whome he thinkes he was
hurte. But whosoeuer wysheth anye
thynge, he must needes when he hathe
attayned the same great
                     •
                  y reioyce: & so
in this case, he shuld reioice at an other
mans misfortune: which if it chaunce
not to any wise 
                     •
                  ā, no more truly may
anger. But if this griefe of the minde
wherof we talk, might happē to a wise
man, then should anger also, which inas

it maye not, no more trulye maye
not gryefe. For if a wise man myghte
feele griefe, then mighte he feele also
pitie, and enuyenge. For pitye and enuie
go together. For who so euer is sorye,
for some mans aduersitye, he may
likewyse enuye some others prosperitie.
As Theophrastus, lamentynge the
death of Calisthenes his felowe, is vexed
and grieued with the prosperitye of
Alexander. And therfore he saieth, that
Calisthenes chaūced on a man of great
power, & notable felicitie, but nothyng
skylfull howe to vse his prosperity. So
as pitye is a gryefe conceyued of other
mens aduersitie, so is enuie a sorowe,
for other mens prosperitye. Who so euer
therfore is subiecte to pitye, he is
also some
                     •
                  ines troubled wyth with enuye.
But to enuye is no point of a wise
man: wherfore neyther to pitye. But
yf a wise man shoulde take greuouslye
any mans aduersitye, he must needes
be subiect to pitie. All gryefe therefore
is farre absent from a wise man.
               These are the reasons of the Stoykes,
and theyr crooked conclusions, which

sometime hereafter we will expresse
more largely, & also more playnely, and
theyr reasons we must nedes 
                     •
                  olowe,
because they ground theyr foundation,
vpon the stoutest and manlyest opinion.
For oure familiar frendes 
                     〈◊〉
                   Perepatetikes
(then the whyche we philosophers
can be eyther more eloquente,
more learned, or more sage) can not
well perswade me, that there is a mediocritie
of the perturbations, or diseases
of the mind. For euery euell thing,
though it be but meane, yet neuerthelesse
is to muche. And we intende to
shewe, that there can be no such griefe
in a wyse man. For as the bodye, if it
be but meetely sicke, yet neuerthelesse,
is farre from healthe: so trulye if the
mind be but meanely troubled, it wanteth
health. Therfore oure countreymen,
as they haue well geuen manye
proper and meete names to other thinges,
so haue they verye well termed
gryefe, care, and anguishe of the minde
(for the likenes that it hathe to the diseases
of the bodye) sickenesse. Wyth
the like worde, do the Grecians terme

all perturbations. For they cal al troublesome
motions of the minde 
                     
                        •
                     athos
whyche is as much in effecte as diseases.
For the sickenes of the minde doth
muche resemble the diseases of the bodye.
But lust is not like to a disease.
               Nor immod
                     •••
                  te ioye, which is the merye
moode of the minde. Neyther is
feare it selfe any thinge lyke a disease,
although it is verye nygh vnto griefe.
But that whyche is called a disease in
the bodye, is commonly called a griefe
in the mind. We must therfore, shewe
the originall beginning of this gryefe.
I meane the thing that worketh griefe
in oure mindes, as some other thynge
doth disease in the bodye. For as the
phisicians, when they haue once found
out the cause of any disease, thinke the
cure thereof to be but lyght: so we whē
we haue once founde the cause of thys
gryefe, shall lyghtlye fynde some helpe
for the same. Al the cause therefore consisteth
in our owne opinion. I meane
not only of gryefe of the minde, but of
all other perturbations also: which are
but foure generallye. But there are

more branches and partes of the same.
For, inasmuch as euery motion of the
minde is eyther voyde of reason, or a
despyser of reason, or disobediēt to reason,
and that motiō is stirred with the
opinion eyther of good or euell, within
these .ii. partes, all the foure perturbations
are equally contayned. For .ii.
proceede of the opinion of good: of the
whyche the one, is called immoderate
ioye, whych ryseth of some marueilous
goodnes beyng atchieued and gotten:
and the other is named desyre, whyche
is an immoderate lust after some thing
of the whiche we haue once conceyued
a great opinion of goodnes, not obeyenge
to reason. And as these two are
moued with the opinion of goodnes, so
are the other .ii. raysed of the opiniō of
some euell. For feare comes of ye opinion
of some great euel, which is at hād:
& sorowe is the opinion of some euell,
already chaunced: and that some suche
euel, y• it seemes but right, that a man
should ve
                     •
                  e him selfe about it, so y• he,
whō it grieues, thinketh y• he ought of
righte to be grieued with it.
               These perturbatiōs, which only folly

sendeth emonges men, as certayne furyes
we must wythstand wyth all oure
might and power, yf we mind to passe
this litle space of our life, quietely and
pleasauntlye. But of the rest we wyll
talke at other times. But nowe let vs
vanquyshe gryefe if we may. For that
is our purpose, inasmuche as you sayde
that you thought it myghte chaunce to
a wyse man: whyche I can by no meanes
thynke. For it is a beastlye wretched,
and detestable thynge, and suche
as we oughte to flye wyth myghte and
maine, as a man might say. Howe like
you then, the neuewe of Tantalus,
the sonne of Pelops, whych heretofore
by force rauished Hippodamia, frome
his father in lawe Oenomaus? Doeth
he seeme nowe to be the kynseman of
Iupiter, lamentinge and vexinge him
selfe like an abiect?

                     Take hede ye straungers al (quod he)
that none to me drawe nie:
                     Least my disease maye you infecte, or
shadowe you annoye.
                     This hatefull plague is rooted in my
fleshe so greuouslye.
                  
               
               
                  
Wylt thou O Thyestes condemne
thy selfe to death, for an other mannes
faulte? But nowe, as for the sonne of
Phebus, do you not thynke hym worthye
to behold his fathers lyghte? who
lamenteth in this wyse.

                     Myne eyes wythin my heade, are
shronke, my bodye loe consumes.
                     The skyn is freated from mine eyes
by my continuall teares:
                     My bed in driuelinges is ydrownd,
my mouth hath stinkyng fumes.
                     And so my breast lookes hoare, lyke
fowle, ye whited plumes aye beares.
                  
               
               These euels, thou thy selfe O foolishe
Aeta, wast the causer of: for they were
not amonges those thinges whyche
chaunce cast vppon the. For all sorowe
as I will hereafter shewe, proceedeth
of the opinion of some euell that is present.
But thou mournest trulye, for the
lacke of thy kyngdome, and not of thy
doughter. For her thou didst hate, and
that perchaunce not wythoute a cause.
But it grieued the greatly, to lacke thy
kyngdome. Trulye it is a shameles sorowe,
to mourne, for that thou mayst

not keepe free men in seruitude. Dionisius
the tiranne, when he was banished
from Siracusa, taught children at
Corinthe. So great desire he had, to
beare rule. But who could be more impudent
then Tarquinius? Who waged
warre wyth them, that would not
suffer his pride. He at the laste when
neyther the armyes of the Ueientes,
neyther yet the Latines, coulde restore
him into his kyngdome, wente to the
citye of Cume in Italye, and therewyth
age and anguyshe pyned awaye.
And thinke you, that the lyke maye
chaunce to anye wyse man? I meane,
to be wasted wyth thoughte? which is
no better than meere miserye. For
whereas euerye perturbation is a certayne
kynde of misery, chiefely sorowe
is the very torment of a troubled mind
Lust bryngeth heate, ouermuche gladnes
causeth lightnes, and feare breedeth
a basenes of courage. But sorowe,
causeth farre greater thynges
then all these, as pynynge, veration,

affliction, and filthinesse. It teares
eates, and murders the minde. It vnlesse
we laye aparte, that we vtterlye
shake it from vs, we can neuer wante
miserye. And this trulye is playne and
euidente, that the cause of gryefe of the
minde, is when any thynge whych we
account to be some marueylous euell,
seemeth to be euen at hande, and presentelye
to pricke vs. But Epicurus
thinketh, that the opinion and thought
of anye euell, causeth sorowe: so that
whosoeuer beholdeth anye great euell,
yf he thinke that the same hath at anye
time chaunced vnto him, he by his opinion
must needes be troubled wyth sorowe.
The folowers of Aristippus,
called Cyrenaikes, thinke that gryefe
of minde, ryseth not of euerye gryefe,
but onelye of suche as commeth vnlooked
for, and vnprouided.
               And assuredlye, that is of no small
force to encrease the gryefe: for all sodayne
chaunces seeme to be more
greeuous then other.
               
                  
And for that cause are these verses worthelye
commended, as the sayenges of
a stablyshed minde.

                     When firste of all I them begot, I
knewe that they must dye.
                     To bring them vp that well to do, I
did my whole dutye.
                     And eke when I to Troy them sent
theyr countrey to defend:
                     I knewe I did to deadly warre, and
not to feastes them send.
                  
               
               This foreknoweledge of euels whych
are to come, doth make the fall of those
thinges more tolerable, whose cummynge
a man hathe longe time afore
foreseene: and for that cause, these sayenges
of Theseus, in Euripides are
commended (For I may lawefully, after
my wonted fashion, turne the same
into latine.)

                     Recounting oft wyth me the wordes
of that wyse father old.
                     In minde the mischieues that might
come, I did alwayes behold,
                     Some cruell deathe, or exile els, and
nowe and then among
                     Of euerye other mischiefe straunge,

I did forethinke a throng.
                     So that if any storme should fall, by
fortunes bitternes:
                     Like as a thinge foreseene before, it
should me grieue the lesse.
                  
               
               Whereas Theseus sayeth, that he
learned it of a wyse olde man, Euripides
meaneth that by him selfe. For he
was the scoler of Anaxagoras, who
when newes were brought him of the
death of his childe, sayde. I knewe that
I begot him subiect to mortality: whiche
sayeng declareth that suche chaunces
are greuous to theym whiche looke
not for them. Therefore, herein trulye
is litle doubte, that all such thinges as
are counted euell, are then moste greeuous,
when they fa
                     •
                  l sodaynelye.
               Wherfore, although this thinge onely
doth not cause sorow, yet neuerthelesse
because the setlyng and preparynge of
the minde, is of great force to asswage
the gryefe, let euerye man forethynke
such, inasmuch as they may happen to
a man. And trulye, it is a great poynt
of wysedome, for a man to looke for all
such casualties, as customably happen

to men, not to meruayle at any thynge
when it doth chaunce, and not to doubt
but anye mischyefe whyche is not
chaunced maye well ynoughe happen.

                     Wherefore let euerye man in hys
prosperitye,
                     Muse with him selfe, by what meanes
he may beare aduersitye.
                     Some peryll, losse, or cruell exyle,
when he returneth home.
                     His childes offence, or his wiues
death, let him aye thinke vpon.
                     And these as commen let him take
besydes some straunger payne,
                     If some good chaunce befall to him,
let him take that as gayne.
                  
               
               ¶Inasmuche as Terence hath spoken
this so wyselye, whyche he borowed of
philosophye, shall not we out of whose
store it was taken, bothe saye the same
better, and also thinke it more constantlye?
For this is the same countenaunce
whyche neuer chaungeth.
               Which Xantippe was wonte to prayse

in her husband Socrates: sayeng, that
he alwayes shewed the same looke at
his commyng home, that he dyd at hys
goynge oute. Neyther was he in this
poynte lyke to Marcus Crassus, who
as (Lucilius sayeth) neuer laughed but
once in all his life. But (as farre as I
coulde learne) he was fayre and cleare

                     •
                  ysaged. And trulye, there was good
cause, whye his countenaunce shoulde
be alwayes alyke, inasmuche as his
mynde, whyche causeth the diuersitye
of al lookes, dyd neuer varye, Wherefore
bothe I will take of the Cyrenaikes,
these weapons agaynst chaunces,
that is to breake theyr force, with long
forethinkynge of the same: and also I
iudge, that that euel which is in griefe
consysteth in mens opinion, and not in
the thinges them selues. For if it were
in the thinges, that chaunce vnto vs,
wherefore shoulde the foresyghte of
them, make them ye lighter. But there
may be more suttle reasoninge of these
matters, yf fyrste we see the opinion
of Epycurus.
               
                  
Who thinkes it necessary, that euerye
man, to whom any euell is chaunced,
shoulde foorthwith lyue in gryefe and
sorowe aswell although he did foresee,
and prouide for those chaunces afore
hand, as also when they waxe olde.
               For neyther doeth the lengthe of tyme
make the euels the lesse (sayeth he) neither
yet the foresyghte of theym, make
vs to beare them more lightly. He sayeth
also, that suche forethinkynge of euels,
is very fond. Because it maye be,
that they shall not chaunce at all.
               Euerye gryefe (sayeth he) is odious ynoughe,
when it doeth chaunce: but he
that alwayes lookes for some aduersitye,
makes it to him a continuall and
euerlastinge miserye. And if it shoulde
chaunce not to come, in vayne then
should a man voluntarilye sorowe.
               So he thinketh, that a man is alwaies
vexed, eyther wyth the chaunce, or els
wyth the thought of some euell. But
the ease of sorowe, he placeth in thinkinge
of gryefe, the other in drawyng
                     •
                  
it to the contemplacion of pleasure.
               For he thinketh, that our minde may

aselye obeye reason, and folowe her
guyde. Reason (sayeth he) dothe forbyd
vs to thinke on gryefe. It drawth our
dull wittes from the sharpe thoughtes
of sorowe, to beholde the miserye of the
same: from the whiche, when she, hath
once wythdrawen vs, she then moues
and stirres vs, to beholde and handle
sundrye sortes of pleasure: the whyche
both to remember when they are past,
and also to hope for, when they are
comming, he thinketh to be the perfect
lyfe of a wyse man. Thus I haue vttered
his opinion, according to my fashiō
But the Epicureans do it after an other
sorte of theyr owne. But nowe
let vs consider, howe lightelye we
esteme theyr wordes in this poynct.
               Fyrste of all, they do without cause reproue
the forethinking of euels to come.
For there is nothinge, that maye so
much dul or lighten the force of griefe,
as a continuall thought and perswasion,
through out all our lyfe, that there
is no miserye, whych maye not happen
vnto vs: as the ponderynge of the condition
and estate of man: as the lawe

of our life, and study to obeye. Whiche
causeth vs not to mourne alwaies, but
neuer. For who so pondereth with him
selfe, the state of euery thing, the inconstancie
of his lyfe, and the weakenes
of mankynd, he doth not then mourne
but rather then chiefelye doth the part
of a wyse man. For hereby he getteth
two commodityes. The one, that in
wayghynge the frayletye of man, he
doth execute the duty of a philosopher,
the other, for that agaynst aduersity, he
hath gotten three confortes. The first,
for that he thought longe afore, that it
might happen. Which onely thought
doth most of all other, swage and wipe
away all sorowe. The second, for that
he thinketh, that all chaunces whyche
may happen to a man, are paciently to
be borne. And last of all, because he seeth,
that there is no euell but where is
some faulte. And it is no faulte of his,
inasmuche as that, which a man could
not withstande, is chaunced. For that
reuoking of our mind frō the thought
of grefe (which Epicurus would haue)

is to no poynct at all. For it is not in
our power, when we are prycked with
miserye, or mischaunce, to dissemble or
forget it. For suche chaunces teare,
vexe, pricke, and enflame vs. And fynallye,
suffer vs not to take anye quyete
rest. And yet neuerthelesse, thou
Epicurus, wyllest me to forget that,
whyche is agaynst nature.
               But nowe, to the helpe whyche thou
shewest of an olde rooted gryefe. Trulye,
althoughe it be somewhat s

                  owe,
yet great is the remedye, that length
of time and space of yeares doth bring.
But thou willest me to propose to my
selfe, the hope of good thynges, and
forget the euell. Nowe trulye thy sayinge
were somewhat, yea and worthy
a notable philosopher, yf thou though
                  
                     •
                  est
those thinges to be good, whyche
in deede are most worthy a mans trauayle
and paines. If Pythagoras, Socrates,
or Plato, should saye thus vnto
me: Why lyest thou sadde? Wherfore

                     •••
                  urnest thou? or why doest thou thus

faynt, and yeld to the stroke of fortune
Which, as perhaps she maye pull and
pricke the, so she can not wholy daunte
thy couragious force. Uertues are of
great power, to resyst and wythstande
the same. Them (if perhaps they slepe
in the) rayse & quicken. Then will the
valyaunte fortitude forthwith be at
hande, whiche will cause the to be of
so good courage, that thou shalt despise
and esteme as nothinge, all chaunces
whych may happen to a man. Then
shall stand by the, temperaunce (which
is also moderance, and by me termed
somewhat afore frugalitye) whych wil
suffer the to do nothinge shamefullye,
or dishonestlye. But what is worse or
shamefuller, thē an effeminate person?
Nowe trulye, iustice will not suffer the
so to do: whych seemes to haue least to
doe in this matter. She wil saye, that
thou art two wayes iniurious. Thone
in that thou desyrest that whych is not
thine, who being borne mortall, doest
looke for the estate of the immortall
gods: thother, for that it greeueth the,
to restore that, whyche was lente thee

onelye to vse for a space. But to prudence
what wylt thou aunswere, whē
she shall saye, that vertue is sufficente
of her selfe, to make a good and happye
life? The excellency of the whych,

                  nted wyth his owne force,
and power, but lacketh the ornamente
of forren goodes: I see no cause whye
it should be so muche eyther commended
in wordes, or coueted in deedes.
               To these goodes O Epicurus, yf thou
cal me, I obey the, I folowe the, I take
the as my guyde. I blot also (as thou
wyllest me) out of my memory al euels
and that also so muche the gladlyer because
I count theym not worthye the
name of euels. But thou drawest my
thoughtes to pleasures, and delightes.
Of what sort I pray the? Of the body,
I thinke, or at the least wise suche, as
we do eyther remember that oure bodye
hath enioyed, or at the leaste wyse

                     •
                  hope, that it shal. Is it any otherwyse?
Do I trulye interprete thy meanynge?
For they are wonte to saye, that we do
not vnderstand what Epicurus meaneth.

Euen this truly he meaneth.
               And this the olde Zeno, the Grecian,
at Athenes in my hearynge was wont
very earnestlye to affyrme, that happy
was he, whyche dyd eyther presentlye
enioye pleasure, or els did hope, he
should enioye it: eyther throughout all
his lyfe, or at the least wyse, throughe
the greatest parte, withoute anye entercourse
of gryefe. Or if there were
any, if it were extreame, that it should
be shorte. Or if it were somewhat long
that it should haue more pleasure, then
myserye. He that did so thinke, he sayd
should be blessed: especially if he were
contented wyth the pleasure, that he
had before taken, and also feared not
god. Thus here you see the happye life
appoynted by Epicurus, descrybed so
playnelye, wyth the wordes of Zeno,
that therein is nothing that he can denye.
Maye the proposyng, and thought
of suche a lyfe then, ease eyther Thy

from his natiue countrey. Of whom

                     Is this that Telamon, whom late
frayle glory raysde on hye.
                     On whom the Greekes of late dyd
gase with many an enuious eye.
                  
               
               ¶Trulye, if anye man with his substaunce
hath loste his courage also, he
must seeke his remedye of those graue
and auncient philosophers, and not of
those slaues of pleasure. For what companie
of goodes is it, that they meane?
Admit trulye, that it were the chiefest
good that mighte be to feele no griefe.
Howbeit that can not well be called
pleasure. But is that such a thinge, as
the syghte or minding thereof myghte
ease our sorowe? Admit that gryefe be
the greatest euell, that may be. Shall
he then that feeleth not it, foorthwyth
enioye the chiefest felicitye? But why
dalyest thou Epicurus? And will not
graunte that thou meanest, that pleasure,
whyche thou thy selfe in other
places doest expresse? Be these whiche
I will rehearse, thy wordes or no?
               In that booke whyche contayneth
thy whole doctryne (for I wyll

nowe playe the parte of an interpreter
leaste anye man thinke I lye) thou spakest
in this wyse. Neyther trulye do I
perceyue what good thing I may imagine,
voyde of those pleasures, that consist
in taste, or voyde of those which consist
in the hearynge of swete noyses: or

                  e syghtes,
whych the eyes do gather of fayre beautyes:
or lackinge the pleasures requysite
to any of the foure senses in man.
Neyther maye we trulye saye that the
delight of the minde is onelye in suche
goodnes as wante all these. For I
knowe, that the minde will so reioyce,
euen wyth the onely hope of those pleasures,
which I haue afore named, that
when it hath once attayned them, it is
voyde of all griefe. These be the wordes
of Epicurus. By the which euerye
man maye righte well perceyue, what
pleasure Epicurus ment. For somewhat
after. Right oft, I haue demaunded
of theym that were counted wyse,
(sayeth he) what they would accompte
good, if they take away those pleasures
by me afore named. But I could get

nothing of them, but onelye bare wordes.
Who if they will name vertues,
and wysedome, they do no more then
shewe the waye of those pleasures, by
me afore named. Those wordes that
folowe are to the same purpose. And to
conclude, all his booke entituled of the
chiefest good, is stuffed with such wordes
& sentēces. Wilt thou then to this
life reuoke Telamō, to ease his griefe?
And if thou chaunce to see anye of thy
frendes vexed wyth sorowe, wylt thou
gyue him rather a daynty dyshe of fishe
then some comfortable booke of Socrates?
Wilte thou exhorte him, to heare
rather the counsell of dayntye courtyers,
then of Plato? Thou wilt set afore
him freshe syghtes to gase on, burne
sweete smelles at his nose, and set garlandes,
and roses about his head.
               Trulye (I thinke) yf thou adde anye
thinge more thou must needes take awaye
all his mourninge. Eyther all
these comfortes Epicurus must confesse,
or elles all those thynges whyche
euen nowe I recited worde for worde
must be blotted out of his booke: or rather

his whole booke must be called in
For it is full of commendation of pleasures.
I aske of him therefore, by what
meanes we maye ease him of gryefe,
whych cryeth out in this sort.

               A goodly verse. For it is both in deede,
worde, and measure lamentable.

Let vs ease him of his gryefe. Howe?
Let vs laye him on a softe featherbed,
brynge him a singinge woman, let vs
burne cedre at his nose, and bring him
some pleasaunt potion, and therewithall
prouide him of some good meat.
               Be these the goodes that are able to
slake the greatest sorowes? For you
euen nowe sayde, you knewe none other
goodes. But I could well agre to
Epicurus, that a man in sorow ought
to be called to the contēplation of good
yf we could agree what that is whyche
we terme good. But some man perchaunce,
will saye. What? thinke you
that Epicurus ment as you enterprete
him? And that his sentences, are to be
referred to bodilye pleasure. No truly.
I thinke nothing lesse. For I see many
thinges, grauelye and notablye spoken
of him. But as I haue often heretofore
sayd the controuersy is of his wordes,
and not of his maners or lyfe. Let him
saye, that he despyseth those pleasures
whyche he did whylome commend, yet
I will well remember, what felicity
                     •
                  
he seemeth by his wordes to declare.
               
                  
For he did not onelye name it by thys
worde pleasure, but also expounded his
owne sayeng, taste (quod he) & the embrasyng
of fayre and seemelye bodyes,
playes, and songes, and those shapes,
with the which the eyes are pleasauntlye
delyghted. Do I fayne? Do I lye?
I desyre to be reproued. For what els
do I coueyte, but that the trueth maye
appeare, in euerye question. He sayeth
also, that the pleasure dothe not encrease,
the gryefe beyng gone: and yet
that it is the chiefest pleasure, to feele
no gryefe. In a fewe wordes, he hathe
made three great faultes. One, in that
he is contrarye to him selfe. For euen
nowe he said, that he could not so much
as thinke, anye thynge to be good, vnlesse
the senses were tickled wyth the
pleasures of the same. And nowe he
sayeth, that to lacke gryefe is greatest
pleasure that may be. May any thinge
be more contrarye? An other faulte is,
that whereas there be naturally thre
                     •
                  
yoyntes, the one to reioyce, the other to
sorowe, the third neither to be glad nor
sorye: he thinketh, the first and the last

to be all one, and dothe not separate
pleasure from the wante of gryefe.
               The thyrde faulte (whyche is commen
to some men) is, that whereas vertue
is the thynge, whyche we oughte
moste of all other to desyre, because
that for the attaynynge of the same,
Phylosophye was chiefelye inuented,
yet he hathe separated felicitye frome
vertue. But (some man will saye) he
doth often commend vertue.
               And trulye, Caius Gracchus, when
he gaue abroade the commen moneye,
and beggered the treasure, yet neuerthelesse
in his talke defended the
same. What shoulde I heare his wordes,
when as I see his deedes to the
contrarye? Piso the thryftye, had alwayes
wythstoode the lawe of dystrybutynge
corne. Yet neuerthelesse, that
lawe beinge establyshed, he beynge
once afore Consull, came to take
corne. Whom when Gracchus espyed
he asked him in the audience of all the
people, what he meant, to come to demaunde

corne by that lawe, whyche
he had alwayes disswaded.
               Whereunto he aunswered, I woulde
not gladlye, O Gracchus (quod he)
that thou shouldest distribute and geue
awaye my goodes. But yf thou wylte
needes do it, I will take some parte
my selfe. Did not that graue and wyse
counsayler, sufficientlye in those wordes
declare that by the lawe of Gracchus,
the commen treasure was scattered?
Reade the oracions of Gracchus,
you will saye, that he is a defender
of the treasure house. So Epicurus
denyeth that a man maye lyue
pleasauntlye, vnlesse he lyue also vertuouslye.
He denyeth also, that fortune
hath anye force on a wyse man.
               He preferreth a bare liuinge, before a
sumptuous and costlye. He sayeth that
there is no tyme, in the whych a wyse
man is not happye. All these thynges
are worthye to be spoken of a philosopher,
neuerthelesse they are contrarye
to pleasure. But he meaneth not

                     〈◊〉
                   sorte of pleasure. Let hym mean
                     •
                  
                  
what pleasure he will, so he dothe not
meane such a pleasure as hath in it not
so much as one iote of vertue. Well, if
we vnderstande not what pleasure he
meaneth, neyther do we knowe what
gryefe he vnderstandeth. But I do
thinke that he whyche thinketh gryefe
to be the chiefest euell, ought not once
to make mention of vertue. Truly the
Epicureans complayne, that I do of a
set purpose inueyghe agaynste Epicurus.
As though we dyd stryue for some
honour or worshippe. I thinke that the
chiefest good consysteth in the minde,
and he placeth the same in the bodye.
I thinke vertue to be it, and he taketh
pleasure for the same. And hereaboute
they contend, and call for theyr neyghbours
helpe, with great outcryes.
               But I am one, whiche litle passe for
suche contention. For I do not nowe
reason of the warre betwixt vs and the
Carthaginenses: wherein neuertheles
whē M. Cato, and L. Lentulus were
of seuerall opinions, yet they did neuer
stryue about it. But these men are
nowe to muche angry, whereas otherwyse

they do not stoutelye ynoughe defend
theyr opinion: for the whych they
are afrayd, either afore y• Senate, or at
the barre, afore the army, or in presēce
of the Censors, to pleade. But wyth
them I wil reason at other times, and
that truly, not wyth the minde to contende:
but wholye glad to yelde to their
reasons. Onely thus muche I will admonishe
thē, that if it were true, that a
wyse man should referre all thinges to
his body, or (to speake somewhat more
honestlye) that he should do nothinge,
but that were for his owne profyte, or
commoditye, because these thinges deserue
no commen prayse, let thē laugh
in theyr sleeues (as they say) and leaue
of theyr open bragges. Nowe there remaineth
the opiniō of the Cyrenaikes:
whych thinke, that gryefe is then onelye
caused, when any mischiefe comes
vnloked for: and trulye that is a great
occasion of gryefe, as I sayde before.
               And also, I knowe that Chrisippus,
thinketh, that chaunces not foreseene,
happen most vehementlye. But this is
not all. For we knowe, that the sodayne

commynge of our enemyes doth
more trouble vs than when we looke
for theym: and also, a tempeste in the
sea, risinge on a sodayne, dothe more
feare the saylers, then that whyche
they haue foreseene afore. And so is it
most commonlye in all other thinges.
But if you do diligentlye weyghe, the
nature of suche sodayne chaunces, you
shall perceyue, that they seeme the
greater chyefelye for two causes.
               Fyrst, because we haue not leasure to
consyder, howe great the thynges are,
whiche, haue chaunced vnto vs. Secondarilye,
for that we thinke it might
haue bene auoyded, if it had bene foreseene:
and so, thinkynge it to haue
chaunced onelye through oure owne
faulte, it maketh oure gryefe the sharper.
Whyche to be true, time it selfe
declareth. Whiche in space doth so asswage
oure sorowe, that the euels remaygninge
all one, yet oure gryefe, is
not onelye minyshed, but also manye
times vtterlye abolyshed.
               Manye Carthaginenses lyued in bondage

at Rome. And lykewyse the Macedonians,
theyr kynge Perses beinge
taken prysoner. I sawe also, in Peleponnesus
(whiles I was yong) certain
Corynthians, whyche myghte hau
                     •
                  
songe the songe of Andromacha, before
mentioned. For their countenāce,
talke, and miserable behauioure, was
suche, that a man mighte well haue
sayde, they were miserable Greekes.
               Yet neuerthelesse, the sodayne sight of
the reced walles of theyr citye Corynthus,
moued me muche more, then it
did the Corynthians theym selues:
whose heartes, the dayly sight thereof,
had euen hardened agaynste sorowe.
               We reade the booke of Clitomachus,
whych he, after the subduynge of Carthage
sente to the citesens, that were
prisoners, to comfort them. Therein is
wrytten a disputacion of Carneades:
whych Clitomachus sayeth, y• he there
hath abridged. In it when it was fyrst
proposed, yt it semeth that a wise man
shoulde lamente the captiuitye of his
countreye, forthewith folowe the reasons
of Carneades to the contrarye: in

the whyche truly, the philosopher, doth
so much comfort theyr presēt calamity,
as in an old gryefe a man would scarse
haue wyshed, or desyred. And trulye, if
that booke had bene sent a fewe yeares
after to theym, it would not so muche
haue holpen theyr sores, as their skarres.
For sorowe, by litle, and litle, in
processe of time, dothe weare and consume:
not for that the thinges theym
selues, eyther are wonte, or maye be
chaunged: but because, at the last, that
whych reason ought to haue done, experience
dothe perswade vs: namelye
that those thinges are but smal, which
seemed to be so great. Why then (some
wyll saye) what neede haue we of reason?
Or of anye of those comfortes,
whyche men do vse, when they would
lyghten the sorowe of such as mourne?
As this and suche other, that nothyng
that is chaunced ought to seme straunge,
or vnlooked for? Yes trulye, he
shall more tolerablye beare euerye discommoditie,
who knoweth, that of necessitie,
suche thinges must chaunce to
men. For suche perswasions in deede,

do make the euell it selfe nothynge the
lesse, only hereof it putteth vs in mind
that nothing is happened, which was
not to be looked for. Neyther yet therefore
are that sorte of perswasions, nothynge
auaylable, to the curynge of
gryete: but they are rather of all other,
the best. Wherefore, these sodayne
chaunces, are not of suche force, that
they onelye should be the causers of all
gryefe. They smyte vs perhaps more
sharpelye, then the rest. But they are
not able, to make those thinges, which
so chaunce, greater then the rest. They
seeme greater, because they are newe,
and freshe, and not because they came
sodaynely. But there are .ii. wayes, to
fynde out the truthe, not in those thinges
onelye, whych haue the apparance
of euell, but in those also, whyth seeme
to be good. For eyther we question of
the nature of the thing it selfe, of what
sort, and howe great it is. As of pouerty
sometimes, whose burden we make
lyght wyth reason, shewing how smal
and howe fewe thinges nature dothe
requyre: or els, from the suttle disputation

of the nature of thinges, we turne
oure talke to examples. And in this
part, we rehearse Socrates and Diogenes,
and also that sayenge of Cecilius.

what myght be the cause, that Cai
                     ••
                  
Fabritius coulde easelye beare it, and
other men not? And to this last kinde,
that sorte of consolation like, whyche
sheweth that those thinges whych are
chaunced, are commonlye incidente t
                     •
                  
the lyfe of all men. For this perswasion
is not onelye of this effect, to put
him in remembraunce that he is a
man: but also it sygnyfyeth that those
thynges are tolerable, whyche other
haue both in times paste borne, and also
do dayly suffer. As if our talke were
of pouertye many pacyent poore men,
myghte be recyted. Or if we shoulde
speake of the contempt of honour, manye
men that haue despysed the same

might be rehearsed, & trulye, euen the
happyer, for so doyng: for surelye theyr
life is aboue al others namely cōmended
which haue preferred theyr priuate
quyetnes, before the styrre of publyke
affayres. Neyther is the saying of that
myghty prince to be forgotten: wherein
he commendeth an olde man, and
accompteth him fortunate, because
wythoute glorye, he shoulde in maner
vnknowen, come to his last ende.
               Lykewyse the mournynge of those,
whyche lament the losse of theyr chyldren,
is swaged, wyth the examples of
them, that haue abyden the like.
               So the tryall of other men afore hand,
maketh that those thynges, whyche
chaunce on a sodayne, seeme lesse in
deede, then we tooke them at the fyrste
to be. So it commeth to passe, that
whyles we ponder the thynges well,
by litle and litle, we perceyue howe
muche oure opinion was deceyued,
and that Telamon dothe well proue
sayenge.

                     
When fyrste of all I them begot, I
knewe that they must dye.
               
               And Theseus.
In minde the mischiefes that might
come, I did alway behold.
               
               ¶And Anaxagoras, sayde. I knewe
that he was borne to dye. For all these
men, long weighing the chaunces that
happen to men, perceiued that they are
not to be feared, accordinge to the opinion
of the commen people. And truly,
me seemeth, that they whiche ponder
thinges afore hande, are holpen after
the same sort, that they are, whom continuance
of time dothe helpe: sauynge
that reason, healeth the fyrste, and nature
the other: they hauinge thys alwayes
in theyr mindes, whyche is the
grounde of all such remedyes, namely,
that the euel whych they thought to be
so greate, is not suche, that it maye destroye
a happye and a blessed lyfe.
               Thus therfore we will conclude, that
of a sodayne chaunce there commeth a
sorer strype, not as they thinke, that
when twoo equall chaunces do happen
to a man, it onelye shou
                     •
                  de put him to

gryefe, whyche commeth of a sodayn
                     •
                  :
for it is wryten that some men vnderstandinge
the commen miserye of
mankind, namely that we are al borne
vnder that lawe, that none may be for
euer voyde of misery: hane taken it verye
heauilye, yea and mourned for it.
               For the whyche cause, Carneades (as
Antiochus writeth) was wonte to reproue
Chrisippus, for cōmending these
verses of Euripides.

                     There is no man whom gryefe of
minde, & sickenes may not payne
                     Some manye children do beget, and
burye them agayne.
                     And death, is thend of al the grieues
that happen may to man.
                     We all must render earth to earth,
and dust from whence we came
                     And til that time shall mowe vs vp,
we here on earth must lyue.
                     Like as we suffer corne to growe,
to reape the same with sciue.
                  
               
               For he sayde, that suche kinde of talke
was of no efficacye to ease a man of
gryefe, but rather, gaue vs occasion to
lament, that we were borne vnder so

                  
                     •
                  ruell necessitye. And as for that kind
                     •
                  
of comfort, whych cometh of the rehersall
of other whyche hane abyden the
lyke gryeues that he thoughte was
good to comforte none other, but onely
those whyche were delyghted to heare
other mennes sorowes. But I trulye
thynke farre otherwyse. For, both the
necessity of bearyng the estate of mankynde,
forbyds vs to stryue wyth god:
and also it putteth vs in remembraūce
that we are men (which onely thought
doth greatlye ease all gryefe) and also
the rehersall of exaumples, serueth not
to delyght the myndes of enuious persons,
but onelye to proue, that he whiche
mourneth, ought to beare it pacyentlye,
inasmuche as, he seeth that

                     •
                   afore him, haue wyth greate
moderation and quyetnes suffred the
same. For they muste haue all maner
of suche stayes, whyche are readye to
fall, and can not wythstand the greatnes
of gryefe. And wel did Chrisippus
saye, that gryefe of minde was called

                  yng of euerye part of a man.
               Whych may well be rooted oute euen
at the fyrste, the cause of the gryefe beinge
once knowen. But the cause of it
is nothynge els, then the opynyon of
some great euell that is prosent and at
hande. But the gryefe of the bodye,
whose prickes are ryghte sharpe, maye
well be borne wyth the hope of ease.
And the lyfe honestly and worshypfullye
spente, is so great a comforte, that
those whyche haue so lyued, eyther
gryefe toucheth not at al, or at the least
verye lyghtlye. But to this opinion of
some great euell, when that also is adioyned,
that we thinke we oughte, and
that it is our dutye to take such chaūce
greuoslye, then trulye, becometh that
gryefe of minde a heauy perturbation.
For of that opinion, proceede those diuers
and detestable kyndes of lamentynge:
tearynge of the heare like women,
scratchynge of theyr face, beating
of the brest, legges, and heade. So is
Agamemnon of Homere, and also of
A

                  ius described.

                     And renting oft for griefe his goodly
bushe of heare.
               
               Whereupon, there is a merye ieste of
Byon. Sayenge that the foolyshe king
pulled of his heare, as though baldnes
would helpe his sorowe. But all these
thinges they doo, thinkynge that they
ought of ryght so to do. And for that
cause, Aeschines inueygheth agaynste
Demosthenes, for that he three dayes
after the deathe of his daughter, had
done sacrafyce. But howe rhetorically
pleadeth he? what reasons gathers he?
Howe wryeth he his wordes? So that
a man may welll perceyue, that a rh

may saye what he lyst. But
truly his talke no man would allowe,
vnlesse we had this foolishe opinion in
oure mindes, that all good men ought
to mourne, for the death of theyr frendes.
Herof it commeth, that in greate
grieues some men flye to solytarynes
                     •
                  
as Homere wryteth of Belerophon.

                     Who flyenge all resorte of men in
fyeldes dyd walke alone.
                     And there consumed and pinde away
with bitter gryefe and moane.
                  
               
               
                  
And Niobe is fayned to haue bene turned
into a stoane, (as I thinke) to note
thereby her continuall solytarynes in
mournynge. But Hecuba, for the cruell
madnes of her minde, the Poetes

                     •
                  ayne to haue bene turned into a dog.
And there be some, whom in sorowe it
delyghteth, to talke wyth solytarines▪
As the nurse in Ennius.

mourninge: as in Homere the daylye
murther, and death of men doth make
theym to cease theyr sorowe. In whom
this is wrytten.

                     For nowe we see to manye erste lye
dead and breathelesse here.
                     So that scarce anye house is voyde of
dole or mourning cheare.
                     Wherfore it is most mete, that them
we in theyr graues do laye,
                     And finishe all our mourning, with
the wayne of sonne and daye.
                  
               
               Wherfore, it is in our power, to lay
                     •
                  
apart gryefe, when we wyll and tim
                     •
                  
bothe serue vs. And is there anye tim
                     •
                  
(because the thynge it selfe is in our
                     •
                  
power) to soone to laye awaye sorow
                     •
                  
and care? It is wel knowen, that those
that sawe Pompeius slayne (fearyng
                     •
                  
in that sharpe and cruell fyght, greatly
the losse of theyr owne lyues, because
they sawe them selues on all sydes enclosed
wyth the nauye of theyr enemyes)
did at that present nothyng els,
but encourage the shippemen to sayl
                     •
                  
swiftely, for the safetye of theyr lyues.

But afterwardes when they came t
                     •
                  
Tyrus, began to afflyct them selues,
and lament. Could feare therfore, stay
them from sorowe, and shal not reason
and wysedome be able to do it? But
what is there, that maye sooner make
vs leaue our sorowe, then whē we perceyue,
that it profiteth vs nothing: and
that all our laboure therein was spent
in vayne? If then we may leaue sorow
we may also not take it al. Wherfore,
we must needes confesse, that of oure

                     •
                  wne will and accord, we suffer griefe
to enter on vs. And that is well declared
also, by theyr paciēce, who hauinge
abiden many cruell chaunces, do more
easelye beare whatsoeuer commeth.
               And are in maner hardened agaynste
the bl
                     •
                  wes of fortune. As he in Euripides.

                     If this time were the fyrste, that I
such miserye did trye.
                     And that afore I had not felte, the
same continuallye.
                     Then had I iuste cause to lamente,
like as newe broken coltes
                     Beare yll the bridles bit, when fyrst

they are brought from the holtes.
                     But I haue euer liued in woe, and
wyth so seeldome chaunge,
                     That nowe as one yduld therwith,
no payne to me is straunge.
                  
               
               Wherefore inasmuche as the wearinesse
of miseryes, doth lighten griefe,
we must nedes confesse, that the thing
it selfe, which is chaunced vnto vs, is
not the cause of oure sorowe. Those
that are chiefely studious of wisedome
and haue not as yet attained the same,
do they not sufficiētly vnderstand, that
they are in great misery? for they haue
not gotten the perfection of wisedome.
And truly there can be no greater miserye,
then the imperfection of wysedome.
Yet neuerthelesse, they do not
lament this miserye. And why so? Because
to this sorte of euels, there is not
affixed that opinion, that it is ryghte
and iust, or any part of our duty to take
it heauilye, for that we are not wyse.
               With the which opinion, that gryefe
is alwayes accompanyed, oute of the
whyche proceedeth mourning. For Aristotle,
blaming the auncient philosophers,

whiche thought that their wittes
had made philosophye perfect: sayeth
that they were eyther most foolishe
or els most vayne glorious of all men.
For he sawe, that within fewe yeares
the same was greatly encreased. So
that it was likely, that in shorte time,
it would be finished. But Theophrastus,
at the time of his deathe is reported
to haue blamed nature. For that to
hertes and dawes, whom the same serued
to litle vse, she had graunted longe
life: but to mē, to whom it mighte haue
bene most commodious, she had graunted
but a short terme. Whose age, if it
might be lengthened, it woulde come
to passe, that all artes beynge made
perfecte, the lyfe of man shoulde be adourned
wyth all kynd of learning.
               And therefore, he did complayne, that
when he fyrst began to perceyue somewhat
therein, then it was his chaunce
to be taken out of this life. Lykewyse
of all the rest, doth not euerye of them
that is counted wisest and grauest witted,

confesse the ignoraunce of manye
poynctes? And that there are manye
thinges, the whiche he would gladlye
learne? And yet neuerthelesse, albeit
they knowe that they sticke in ignoraunce,
then the which there can be no
thinge worse, they do not sorowe nor
mourne. For they haue no suche opinion,
that it is anye parte of theyr dutye,
to be sorye. They whyche thynke that
men oughte not to mourne, as Quintus
Maximus, who buryed his onelye
sonne, that had bene once Consul: as
Lucius Paulus, who loste bothe hys
sonnes in one daye: as Marcus Cato,
whose sonne dyed when he was appoyncted
to be Pretor: As all the rest
whom we haue reckened vp in ours
booke whyche is entituled of the comforte
of Philosophye. The mournings
of all these men (I saye) what other
thyng dyd staye, but that they thought
sorowe and sadnes to be thynges not
properlye belonging to any man.
               
                  
So whereas other men, delayed with
an opinion of dutye, do yelde thē selues
to gryefe, they thinkinge it a shame,
did wythstand sorowe. Whereby it is
euident, that griefe of mind, consisteth
not in the nature of the chaunce, but in
the opinion of men. Agaynst this it is
sayde, who is there so madde, y• would
of his owne voluntary will be sad and
mourne? Nature bringeth sorowe. To
the whyche, your Crantor (saye they)
thinketh, that we ought to yelde. For
it doth pricke, and burden vs, neyther
can we resyst it. So Oileus in Sophocles,
which comforted Telamon afore,
when he mourned for the deathe of
Aiax, he (I saye) when he hearde of his
owne mischaunce, was euen ouercome
wyth sorowe. Of the sodayne chaunge
of whose minde, these verses are wytnesse.

                     I thinke no man so cōstant is, whose
wytte can serue him so.
                     That though he counsayle other, to
asswage theyr gryefe and woe.
                     Yet when that fortune hath on him,
once layd her heauy stroke.
                     
                        Would not be ouercome, and wyth
his owne hurt straight way broke
                     So that the wordes which he afore,
to others wysely spake,
                     Should slippe awaye as thinges the
which aduersity did slake.
                  
               
               By suche kinde of proofes, they go about
to perswade, that we maye by no
meanes withstand nature. Yet neuerthelesse,
they them selues confesse, that
men sometimes take greater sorowe,
then nature constraineth them. What
madnes is it then, that we shoulde desyre
euery man so to do? But there are
manye causes of sorowe. Fyrste, the opinion
which we haue, that is an euell
whiche is chaunced vnto vs. Whyche
when we be once perswaded, thē griefe
of minde doth necessarilye ensue. The
second occasion is, for that they thynke
theyr mourninge to be acceptable to
suche, as are departed. And hereunto
is adioyned, a certayne effeminate superstition.
For they thynke, that they
shall the sooner contente the anger of
the immortall gods, if they as men astonyed
wyth theyr heauy stroke, do af
                  
                     •
                  lycte

and vexe theym selues. But in
the meane tyme, these men marke not
howe contrarye they are to theym selues.
For they commend theim, whiche
dye wyllinglye. And yet they disprayse
those, that beare not heauilye the departure
of theyr frendes. As though
                     •
                  
it might be by anye meanes, that anye
man shoulde loue another better than
him selfe. That is a notable sayenge,
and (if you marke it well) ryghte and
true, that such as ought of all other to
be dearest vnto vs, we loue as our selues.
But that we shoulde loue theym
more then our selues, I thinke that is
trulye impossible. Neyther trulye is it
to be desyred in frendeshippe, that my
frende should loue me more, then hym
selfe: or I hym more then my selfe.
               For thereof woulde ensue, a confusion
of the whole trade of oure lyfe,
and of all sortes of dutyes. But hereof
we will reason, in other places. Nowe
this shalbe sufficiente to admonyshe,
that to the losse of frendes we doe not

adioyne our miserye: and that we loue
them not more, then they them selues
would, or at the leaste wyse more then
our selues. For whereas some saye
that suche kinde of comfortes, do helpe
manye men nothynge at all, and adde
thereunto, that suche as comforte others,
when fortune tourneth her face
to theym, are not able to cloke theyr
owne miserye: the aunsweryng of both
is easye ynoughe. For these are the
faultes not of nature, but of follye.
               But to inueyghe agaynste such follye,
although I might at this present very
largelye, yet I wyll not. For both they
whych do not suffer theym selues to be
holpen, do thereby prouoke others to
miserye, & also, they y• take theyr owne
chaunce more greuouslye, then afore
they counsayled others, are not more
to be blamed then the commen sorte,
whyche beynge nygardes, yet reproue
coueytous parsons, and beynge ambitious
theym selues, reprehend
                     •
                   
                  
                     •
                  ā ynegl
                     •
                  ryous
fooles.
               
                  
For it is a commen practise of fooles,
to espye other mens faultes, and ouerpasse
theyr owne. But this is a great
proofe, that whereas it is certayne,
that time taketh aways sorow, yet that
helpe doth not consyste in time it selfe,
but in long musing and ponderynge of
the mischaunce. For if both the chaūce
and also the man him selfe, are alwayes
one, howe maye the sorowe be
any part swaged? yf neyther the thing
whiche caused it, neyther yet the man
whych soroweth, are chaunged? wherfore,
this continual opinion, that there
is no euell in the thinge, that is chaunced,
doth helpe the sorowe, and not the
length of time. Here some men bryng
in the moderation of all perturbations
whych if it be naturallye in man, then
wyll nature it selfe appoynt a measure
of sorow. But they consist onely in the
opinion. Let that opinion be wholye
rooted out therefore. Nowe (I thinke)
we ha
                     ••
                   sufficientlye proued, that sorowe
procedeth of the opinion of some
present euel: to the which opinion also,
this is adioyned, that we oughte of

ryght to lament and be sorye. To this
definition, Zeno hath well added, that
that opinion of some presente euell,
ought to be fresh. By the which terme
he doth vnderstand, not onelye that to
be freshe, whyche hapned but late, but
also, as longe as, in that whyche we
tooke to be euell, there is anye force or
countenaunce whyche troubleth vs.
               As Arthemisia, the wyfe of Mausolus,
kinge of Carya, whyche made that famous
tombe at Halycarnassus, she (I
saye) all her life time lyued in sorowe:
and therewyth also at lengthe consumed.
To her, this opinion whiche we
nowe talke of, was continually freshe.
He therefore that wil assaye to comfort
any man, in his sorowe, oughte eyther
vtterlye to roote oute his gryefe, or to
appease it, or els to mitigate it as
much as maye be, or els to suppresse it,
not suffering it to spreade any further,
or els to tourne his minde frome one
gryefe to another. There be some, who
thinke, that this onelye is the dutye of
him that would assay to comforte anye
man, to proue that it is no euell at all.

Of the whyche opinion Cleantes is.
               There are other some whyche would
huae him shewe, that the euell is not
so great as he taketh it. And of this
minde are the Peripatetikes, and other
there be, whyche thynke it sufficiente
to shewe, that it is no straunge
chaunce, whyche is happened. Chrysippus
thinketh, that it is one of the
chyefest poynctes of comforte, to take
awaye from him that is in heauinesse
this opinion, that he ought of dutye to
lament, and be sorye. There be some
also, that put al these thinges togyther
for dyuers men are dyuerselye moued.
I haue put theym all in my booke,
whyche I wrote of consolation. For at
that present, my mynde was greatlye
vexed, and I assayed all meanes to
helpe my selfe. But we must take our
tyme, as well in the diseases of the
minde, as of the bodye. As Prometheus
in Aeschilus. To whom when one
sayde.

                     But this (Prometheus) I do thinke,
you knowe assuredlye
                     That reason force full lightly may,

               He aunswereth in this wyse.

                     I thinke so eke, if to the same, a man
laye salue in time.
                     And do not to a festred sore, applye
his medecine.
                  
               
               The fyrst precept therefore in consolation,
is to shewe that that whyche is
chaunced, is eyther no euell, or els verye
small. The nexte is, to shewe the
commen estate and miserye of mankynde.
The thyrde, that it is meere
follye in vaine to waste him selfe wyth
sorowe: especiallye, in asmuche as he
perceyued, that he is nothinge holpen
thereby. For Cleantes comfort, serues
but for a wyse man, who nedes no comforte
at all. For yf you perswade a sorowefull
minde, that nothing is euell,
but that whiche is dishonest, you shall
not by that meanes take awaye his sorowe,
but his follye. But trulye both
the time, is yll t
                     •
                   teache, and also it
seemeth, that Cleantes sawe not,
that gryefe of mynde myght be styrred
sometimes, vppon suche occasion, as
I am sure he hym selfe wyll confesse

not to be greatly euell. For what wyll
he say hereunto? when Socrates perswaded
Alcibiades, that there was no
poynct of manhode in him, and that he
was no better thē the vilest slaue, that
went on the grounde. When Alcibiades
did for thys cause afflicte him, and
humbly weeping, requested Socrates
to enstructe him in vertue, y• he mighte
flye vyce: what? wil you say Cleantes?
that the cause of Alcibiades griefe was
no euell at all, because it was not the
greatest euell that might be. Lycon,
mindinge to make men esteeme griefe
of minde, as a light matter, sayes that
it is stirred vppon small occasions: as
wyth the mischaunces of fortune, and
bodilye hurt, wythout anye euels pertaynyng
to the minde. But dyd not the
griefe of Alcibiades, ryse chiefelye for
the vyces, whiche he felte in his owne
minde? Nowe of the consolation of Epicurus
we haue spoken sufficientlye
heretofore. Neyther truly is that kinde
of comforte verye stronge, although it
both is much vsed, and also manye tymes
taketh effecte, I meane, to shewe,

that suche chaunces come not to hym
onely. It helpeth in deede (as I haue
sayde) but neyther at all times, neither
yet all men. For there are some that
despyse it. But it is a great matter,
bowe we beare it. For we oughte not
to tell, what mischaunce euery priuate
man hathe suffered, but howe wyselye
wyse men haue borne it. The consolation
of Chrisippus, is the strongest for
the truth of the sayenge: but hardest to
perswade in time of sorowe. For it is a
hard worke to proue to one that mourneth,
that he dothe it of his owne free
will, and for that he thinketh he ought
so to do. Wherefore, as in pleadyng of
causes, we do not alwayes vse one
kynde of state (for so we terme the sundrye
sortes of controuersyes) but therein
confyrme oure selues, to the tyme,
the nature of the question, and the person
of ye hearer, so must we do in the asswaging
of griefe. For we must marke
what kynde of cure eche man is apt to
take. But I knowe not howe I haue
made a longe digression from our purpose.
For you moued your question of a

wyse man, to whom eyther nothynge
maye seeme euell, that wanteth dishonestye,
or els if any euell chaunce vnto
him, it is lightly ouercome wyth wisedome:
so that it is scarce sene. Because
he fosters no fonde opinion, to the encrease
of his gryefe. Neyther thynketh
it wysedome to vexe and waste hym
selfe wyth mournynge. Then the
whych there can be nothinge worse.
               Yet neuerthelesse, reason hath taught
vs (as I thynke) albeit it was not oure
appoynted question at this presente
tyme, that nothynge is euell, but that
whyche is dishoneste. Or at the lea

wyse, if there be anye euell in gryefe,
that it is not naturall, but proceedeth
of our owne voluntarye will, and erronious
opinion. Thus we haue treated
of the nature of sorowe, whyche is
the greatest of all gryefes. For it beinge
taken awaye, the remedyes of the
reste neede not greatlye to be soughte.
Yet neuerthelesse, there are especyall

sorowe, ryddeth also all the reste, that

for euerye one of these.
               
                  
But we muste alwayes come to thy
                     •
                  
foundation, that all griefe of minde,
ought to be farre from a wyse man.
               Because it is vayne and to no purpose
Because it is not naturall, but proceedeth
of a fond opinion, and iudgement
alluryng vs to sorowe, when we haue
once determined, that we oughte so to
do. This beinge taken awaye, whyche
wholy consisteth in our owne wyll, all
sorowefull mourne, shall be vtterlye
quenched. Perchaunce, certayne priuy
prickes may remayne, whych let them
count naturall, so that the heauye, terrible,
and deadlye name of sorowe, be
gone. Which may by no meanes dwel
wyth wysedome. But there are many
bytter braunches of sorowe, which the
stocke beinge once rooted oute, muste
needes wither and peryshe. Howe be it
we had nede of seuerall reasoninges against
them: wherein, we wyl bestowe
some time of leasure. But there is one
nature of all the gryeues of the mynde
albeit there are seuerall names. For

in some other place perhaps, entreate
more at large. These are the shootes of

that they might neuer ryse agayne.

those studyes, which beinge crepte but
verye late into some estimation wyth
vs, and therefore scarcely missed or desyred
vntil these later dayes, they haue
nowe deriued our of Greece, into this
our city. For wheras euen frō the very
beginning of y• citie. Partlye by orders
appoynted by the kynges, whych then

reygned, & partly by written lawes, diuination
by byrdes, ceremonies, elections
of officers, appealementes, a parliament
of lordes, a muster of horsemē,
and footemē, were ordayned: yet much
more afterwardes, the commen welth
being once eased of the yoke of the kingdome,
there was made a wonderfull
forwardnes and a spedye course, to all
kynde of excellency. But this place serueth
not, to talke of the customes and
ordinaunces of our forefathers, or of
the orders and gouernaunce of the cytye.
Thereof, we haue spoken sufficientlye
in other places. But chiefely, in
those .vi. bookes, which we haue written
of a commen wealth. But in this
place, whiles I consider wyth my selfe
the studyes of all sortes of artes, and

thinke, that as they haue ben borowed

               nd broughte from the Greekes, so of

but also preserued and honoured. For
there was well nye in the syght of our

wonderfull wisedome, and great fame

deliuered his countreye, from the bondage

spreadinge farre abrode, came at
the last also into this our city: the which
we may gather, both by manye probable
coniectures, & also by euidente reasons,
whiche in maner of steppes shall
shewe vs the truthe. For who woulde
thinke, that, whereas the countrey called

               e I say, that the

wherby it is euidēt y• songes euen

law of the .xii. tables doth declare, that

verses were wonte to be made at that
present: in that they commaunde, that
no man should make anye ditye, to the
hurte of another. Neyther maye thys
seeme a lyghte proofe, of the learninge
whyche they vsed in those times: that,
afore the pillowes of the gods, and at
the feastes of the magistrates, musicians
did playe: whyche was a thynge,
chyefely vsed of that secte, of whyche I
nowe speake. Furthermore the verse
of Appius the blynde, which Paneti

cōmendeth hyghly, in an epistle which
he wrote to Q. Tubero, seemeth is
sauour Pithagoras doctrine. There be
many of our orders also, which we had
from them, which I do here ouerpasse,
leaste we maye seeme to haue learned
those thinges otherwhere, whyche we
are thoughte to haue inuented our selues.
But to brynge backe my talke to
my fyrst purpose: in howe shorte tyme,
howe many and howe notable poetes,
but chiefely what excellent oratoures,
haue there bene amonge vs? So that it
may well appeare, that oure countreymen
could attayne al thinges, as soone

as they gaue theyr mindes vnto them.
And of other studyes, we bothe will
speake in other places, if neede shal requyre,
and also haue already spoken very
ofte. But the studye of wysedome, is
rooted truly among vs: howebeit afore
the time of Lelius and Scipio. I scarse
fynde any, whom I might well name
wyse. In whose youth I vnderstande,
that Diogenes the Stoike, and Carneades
the Academike, were sent emba
                  ••
               adours
from the people of Athenes
so oure Senate, who hauinge neuer
borne any office in the commen welth:
& being borne the one at Cyrene, the other
at Babilon, trulye as I thinke,
they had neuer bene appoynted to that
office, vnlesse in theym, as in certayne
principall men, all studyes of learnyng
at that time had chiefelye flouryshed.
            Such men, when they employed theyr
wyttes, to writinge, some penned the
ciuile lawe, some their owne orations,
some the monumentes of theyr forefathers.
But this moste ample and necessarye
arte of all the rest. I meane the
rule of good lyfe, they taughte more

wyth theyr sincere cunning, then with
anye monumentes of learninge. And
therfore of that true and excellent philosophye,
which inuented of Socrates,
hath hitherto remayned amonges the
Peripatetikes, there be almost, eyther
none, or els very fewe Latine workes,
either, because of the greatnes & hardnes
of the thinges thē selues, or els, because
they thought, that their trauayle
therein, should be nothinge acceptable
to such as were rude and ignoraunt.
            But while those worthy sages whisted
& kept silēce, there rose one Caius Amasanius,
 wt whose bookes the people being
perswaded gaue them selues to his
doctrine, whether it were, for that it
was very easy to learne, either because
they were allured thereunto, with the
flattering baites of pleasure, or els because
there was no other philosophye
wryten, y• which they heard, they folowed.
But after Amasianus manye folowers
of his doctrine writing manye
bookes, spred the same, throughout all
Italye. And y•, whiche is a great proofe
that there is no wittye inuention, in
theyr reasons, I meane because they be

both lightli perceiued, & also allowed of
y• vnlearned, yt thei thinke to be a great
strengthening to al their doctrine. but
let euery mā defend what he likes best
For eche mans iudgement ought to be
free. I wil kepe mine old wonte: & binding
my selfe to no one sect to y• whych
I ought of necessitie to be subiect, will
alway seke out, what in all thinges is
most likelye to be true. Whiche I haue
done, both in manye other places heretofore.
But chiefelye of late in my manour
of Tusculanū with earneste paynes.
Wherfore since I haue alreadye
tolde you our .iii. dayes reasoninges, it
resteth that in this booke you heare the
fourth dayes disputacion likewyse.
            Therfore, when we came downe into
our shaded walke, as we did all the rest
of the dayes, y• matter fell out thus.
            Let some man say, whereof he wil dispute.
            
               Hea.
               I thinke that a wise man cā
                  not
want al perturbations of y• minde.
            
            
               Mar.
               Yesterday you thoughte that he
might want sorowe vnlesse perchaūce
you agreed onely because of the shortenes
of the time.
            
            
               Hea.
               Not so, for your
talke did meruaylously well please me.
            
            
               
               Mar.
               Thinke you then that sorowe
can not happē to a wise man.
            
            
               Hea.
               Yea
truly, I thinke it can not.
            
            
               Mar.
               But if
it can not trouble the minde of a wyse
man, then truly can none at all. For
what should do it? might feare disquiet
it? But feare pr
                     •
                  ceedeth but of the absence
of those thinges, whose presence
causeth gryefe and sorowe. Takynge
away sorowe therefore, feare is gone.
Then there remayne two perturbations:
light gladnes and desyre. Which
if they can not chaunce to a wyse man,
then shal his minde be alwaies quiete.
            
            
               Hea.
               So in deede I thynke.
            
            
               Mar.
               Whether wyl you then, that we forthwyth
hoyse vp all oure sayles, or els as
shipmen are wonte to do, when they
come forth of a hauen, to rowe a while
wyth ores.
            
            
               Hea.
               What meane you
by that? for I do not well vnderstande
you.
            
            
               Mar.
               Because Chrisippus, and
the Stoykes, when they reason of the
perturbations of the mind, do bestowe
a great parte of the time, in deuidynge
and defininge. Which talke of theyrs,
assuredlye is of litle purpose, to ease a

troubled minde. But the Peripatetikes,
bryng manye reasons to the comfortyng
of our mindes, and ouerpasse
these crabbed partitions, and definitions.
I did therefore aske of you, whether
I should at the fyrst, hoyse the sayles
of my talke, or els at the beginning
rowe the same forwardes wyth the
ores or logyke.
            
            
               Hea.
               I thinke it best
euen so. For by that meanes best, shall
my question be discussed.
            
            
               Mar.
               Truly,
it is the wysest waye. For hereafter
you may as

                  e of me, if any thing seeme
some what darke vnto you.
            
            
               Hea.
               I will
do so in deede. But you neuerthelesse,
after your accustomed wonte, shall expresse
these darke reasons more plainelye,
then the Greekes d

               I wil do my endeuoure. But you
had neede to heare attentiuelye: leaste
yf you chaunce to forget some one smal
thinge, all the reste also maye chaunce
to slippe from you. Because those motions
(which the Greekes terme Pathae,
we call perturbations rather then diseases:
in describing of them, I wil first

                     •
                  lowe the auncient order of Pythagoras,

then the trade of Plato. Who deuideth
the minde into two poynctes: o
                     •
                  
the which, the one they say is endewed
with reason, & the other is wholy voide
of the same. In that part which is partaker
of reason, they place quietnesse
with an assured constācy. In the other,
they say, are al the troublous motions,
as well of anger as desyre, whiche are
all enemyes, and contrary to reason.
               Let this therfore be oure foundacyon:
but in describyng these perturbations,
we wyll vse the
                     •
                   definitions and diuysions
of the Stoykes, which in my opinion
handle this questiō more wittely
then all the rest. This therefore, is the
definitiō of Zeno, that that, whych we
terme perturbation, & he Pathos, is a turning
from the rule of reason, contrary
                     •
                  
to the nature of the minde. Some describe
it more shortly, to be a vehement
appetite. By vehemēt, thei meane such
a lust, as hath swarued farre from the
constancye of nature. But the sundrye
kyndes of perturbatiōs (they say) haue
their beginninge of the two sortes of
goodes, and two sortes of euels. And
so there are in noumber foure. Two

that are stirred by the opinion of some
good thing: whych are desyre and gladnes.
For gladnes proceedeth of ioye,
for some good thinge, that is present:
& desire, of some good that is to come.
And two that are caused of the opinion
of some euell, whyche are feare and
griefe of minde. Feare of euel to com
                     •
                  ,
and sorowe for some present euell. For
those thinges, whiche we feare, when
they are coming, those put vs to griefe
when they are come. But mirthe and
desyre, proceede alwaies of the opinion
of some good thinges▪ Desyre feruentlye

                  ueted. For naturalli,
euery man coueites that which
s
                     •
                  emeth to be good, and flyes the contrarye,

same. Suche a desyre or luste, the
Stoykes name Voyl

                        •
                     , and we terme
willinge. It, they thynke, to be

in a wyse man onelye, and defyne it
thus. Willynge, is that, whyche desyreth
any thyng according to reason.
               But it whych coueytes agaynst reason
is called lust, or immoderate desyre,
whyche is in all fooles. Also when we
haue attayned anye good thynge, oure
minde is moued two maner wayes.
               For eyther it is quyetelye moued vnto
mirth according vnto reason: and then
it is called i
                     •
                  ye: or els it reioiceth vaynlye
wythout measure, and then it may
wel be called light or ouermuch mirth.
Whyche they defyne to be the ioye of
the minde, wythoute reason. And as
we do naturally coueyte such thinges,
as seeme in oure eye to be good, so doe
we naturallye flye from those thinges
which seeme to be euell. Whych if we
do according vnto reason, we may wel
call it warynes: and saye, that it is in
none, but onely such as are wyse. But
yf it be wyth an humble submission,
wythout reason, then may it be called
feare. So feare is wearynes agaynst
reason. But as for anye affection
that should be in a wyse man, because

of some presente euell, there is none at
all. But that wherwith fooles are combred,
is sorowe, whych procedeth of the
opinion of some present euell, and causeth
theym to abate theyr courage, and
faynt, contrary to reason. For the whiche
cause, it is defyned, to be a faynting
of the minde, contrary to reason. So
there are foure kindes of perturbatiōs:
and but three sortes of good motions,
because there is no good motion contrary
to sorowe. But they thinke, that
all these perturbations are stirred of
our owne iudgement, and free wyll.
               And for that cause, they defyne they
                     •
                  
yet more strayghtly: that men may not

                     •
                  nelye perceyue, howe yll they be, but
also, that they are in our owne power.
Sorowe therfore, is a freshe opinion of
s
                     ••
                  e present euel. In the whych it seemeth
ryghte, that the minde shoulde

                  mble and submitte it selfe to gryefe.

that i

                   presente, wherein, it seemeth

                     •
                  yght to reioyce. Feare is the opynyon

                  me euel hangyng ouer vs, whyche
we thinke our selues scarse able to suffer.

Desyre is the opinion of some good
likely to come vnto vs, whych it were
for our profyte presently to haue. But
in these opinions, they do not onelye
place the perturbations theym selues,
but also those thinges whych are done
by them. As gryefe of minde, causeth a
certayne nippinge of sorowe, and feare
a fayntinge & submission of the minde,
and ioye an vnreasonable mirthe, and
lust an immoderate desyre. And this
worde opinion, which we haue put into
euery one of the former definitions,
they interprete to be a lyght agreemēt.
But of euerye perturbation, there are
many partes of the same sorte. As of
gryefe of minde, inuyenge, (for we
must vse at this time that word, albeit
it be not much in vse. For enuye is not
properly sayd to be in him onely, which
dothe enuye another, but also in hym
whych is enuied) emulation, obtraction,
pitye, anguyshe, waylynge, mourninge,
gryefe, sadnesse, lamentacion,
carefulnesse, trouble somenes, afflictiō,
desperation, and such like. The sundry
sortes of feare, are slouthfulnes, shame

terrour, f
                     •
                  are, dread, extreame, feare examination,
trouble, fearefulnesse. Of
ioye, there is maleuolence, reioycing at
other mens losse, vaine delg
                     •
                  htes, boastinge,
and others like. Of luste, or desyre,
there are anger, shaking, hatred,
enmity, indigence, desyre, wyth others
of the same sorte. And all these partes,
they defyne after this sorte. Enuienge,
is a sorowe taken for some other mans
prosperity, which nothinge hurtes the

                     •••
                  your. For, yf anye man be aggreeued
with the prosperitye of anye man,
that is noysome to him, he can not be
well sayde to enuye him. As no man
would saye, that Agamemnon did enuye
Hector. But he, whiche is grieued
wyth the prosperity of some other man
whyche is nothing hurteful to him, is
sayde to enuye. But emulation is taken
two maner wayes, the one prayse
worthy, thother discommendable.
               For, the desyre to excell in vertue, is

                     •
                  alled emulation. But thereof we will
say nothing at this time. For it is commendable:
and also, there is emulation
which is a gryefe taken, for that another:

hath obtayned that whych we 
                     〈◊〉
                  
t
                     •
                   haue, and we do lacke it, and
this we nowe speake of. Obtrectation
is a 
                     •
                  orowe taken, for that an other
man hath gotten that whych we desysyred.
Pitie, is a sorowe taken for the
miserie of some man plagued therwith
vniustlye. For the punishemente of a
mankyller, or a traytoure mo
                     •
                  eth no
man to pitye. Anguyshe, is a sharpe
gryefe. Wayling is a sorowe taken of
some mans death, whom we loued entyerly.
Mourninge is a lamentable sorow.
Griefe is a paynful sorowe. Sadnes
is a vexinge sorowe. Lamentation
is sorowe ioined with mourning. Carefulnesse
is griefe ioyned with thought.
Troublesomnes, is a cōtinuall gryefe.
Affliction, is sorowe ioyned with vexation
of the body. Desperation is grie
                     ••
                  
wythout hope of amendmēt. The partes
of f
                     •
                  are are defyned thus. Slouthe,
is a feare of some labour to come. Terroure
is a quakynge feare. For like as
blushyng foloweth shame: so doth after
terroure, come palenes and quakyng.
Dreade, is the feare of some euell nye

at hande. Extreame feare is suche, as
maketh a man besides him selfe. wherof
there is this verse of Ennius.
Then extreame feare, out frō with
in me, did berieue my wittes.
               
               ¶Exanimation, is a feare folowynge
and ensuinge extreame feare. Conturbatiō,
is a feare, dispersing the thoughtes.
Fearefulnesse, is a continual feare
The partes of feare they describe in
this wyse. Maleuolence, is a pleasure
conceyued of an other mans aduersity,
which is nothinge to our profyte. Delyghte,
is a pleasure reioycinge the
mind, with some pleasaunt noise, sight
touching, smell, or taste. Which are al
of one sorte. Pleasures inuented to effeminate
the minde. Boastinge, is a
light and a bragginge pleasure. The
partes of desyre they define in thys
wise. Anger is a desyre to punishe him
which seemeth to haue hurt vs wythout
cause. Chafing, is an anger soone
begon & soone ended, which in Greeke
is called Thymosis, Hatred, is an inueterate
malice. Enmity, is anger, waitīg
time to reuenge. Discorde, is a bytter

anger, conceyued with inward hatred,
from the heart. Indigence, is an insatiable
lust. Desyre, is a lust to see some
thinge that is not presente. But, the
fountayne and spryng of all perturbations,
is intemperance. Whiche is a
swaxuinge of the whole minde, from
the obedience of reason: so strayed from
the rule of the same, that the lustes of
the minde, can neyther be ruled nor
brydeled. Wherfore, like as temperaunce
doth quiete all lustes, and maketh
theym to obey reason, and kepeth
the iudgementes of the minde vncorrupted:
so the enemye of the same, intemperaunce,
disquieteth, troubleth,
and vexeth euerye part of the mynde.
               And for that cause, bothe sorowe and
gryefe, and also the other perturbations,
are stirred by her. Like as when
the bloud in the bodye of man, is once
corrupted, or fleaume or choler doth abound,
it causeth syckenesses and diseases
to rise in the body: so, the trouble
of euell opinions, and theyr contraryetie
amonges them selues, bereues
the minde of healthe, and troubles it

wyth dyseases. Those diseases take
theyr first beginning of perturbatiōs▪
whyche the Greekes call Nosimata. In
this poyncte the Stoikes take muche
paynes, in comparynge the diseases of
the minde, wyth the sickenesses of the
bodye. Which (as a thyng nothing necessarye)
being ouerpassed, let vs com
                     •
                  
to the matter. Let this therfore be presupposed,
that euery perturbation, because
of opinions troublouslye tossyng
to and fro, is alwaies mouing. When
this heat and styrringe hath perced the
minde, and is entered as it were into
the vaynes and mary, thē ryseth there
both some sickenes, and disease, and also
those vyces whyche are contrarye to
the same. For vertue, is not contrarye
to anye perturbation but a meane betwyxt
two of theym. These thynges
whych I saye, differ in thinkynge, but
in deede they are all one: and ryse of

                  nd as in the proportion of euels, the minde maye well be resembled to the body, so it maye likewyse in good thinges. For the chyefe partes in the body are beautye, myght, health, and swiftnes. The same likewyse, there are in the minde. The bodye is in healthe when those principles of the which we consist, agree among them selues, and iarre not.

wyse man is not subiect to euerye perturbation.
For he doth none of those
thinges whych are beastlye and cruell.

Yea, and those perturbations, whyche
sometimes chaunce vnto him, haue a
certayne shewe of gentlenes: as pitye,
sorowe, and feare. But those sickenesses,
and diseases of the minde are more
harde to be rooted oute, then those extreme
vices, whyche are contrarye to
vertues. For those olde rooted dyseases
remayning, vices can not be taken awaye.
Because they are not so lyghtlye
healed, as the other rooted out. And
thus you haue so much, as the Stoikes
subtelye reason of perturbations.
               Which they call logicall, because they
are profoundlye wrytten. From the
which, since our talke is now escaped,
as it were from cragged rockes, nowe
let vs go to the other part of our disputations:
if you thynke that we haue

                     ••
                  th at other times hertofore, we haue
spoken muche of vertue, and must also

hereafter do the same. In manye oth

                  r
places, (for moste of those questions,
whych pertayne to the trade of life and
maners, are grounded vppon vertue)
for that cause we wil nowe define vertue.
Whych is a constante, and laudable
affection of the minde: bothe makynge
them in whom it is commendable:
and also it selfe, euen wythoute the
name of profyte, worthy of prayse.
               From it, do procede all honest desyres,
wordes, and deedes. And to be shorte,
the whole rule of reason. Howebeit,
vertue it selfe, may in the bryefest maner,
well be termed the rule of reason.
To this vertue, vyce is contrarye, for
so, I thinke better to terme it, then
malyce: whych the Greekes call Kaki
                        •
                     .
For, malice is the name, of some one
certayne vyce. But vice is the name of
all. From whiche also, proceede al perturbations.
Whiche be (as I sayde afore)
the troubled and stirred motions
of the minde, strayed from reason: enemyes
of the mynde, and also of a quyete

lyfe. For they brynge wyth they
                     •
                  
carefull and bitter gryeues, they afflycte
and weaken the minde, wyth
feare. They inflame it also, wyth a
greedy appetite. Whych we terme, eyther
desyre or luste. Whiche is an impotencye
of the minde, swaruing from
temperaunce, and moderatiō. Whiche
if it chaunce to obtayne that, whyche
it did desyre, then it falleth into excessi
                     •
                  e
myrth. So that, then, nothynge
whyche he dothe is to anye purpose at
all. Lyke as he, whyche thynketh ioy
                     •
                  
and pleasure of the minde, to be th
                     •
                  
chyefest erroure. The helpe of all
these euels, consysteth in vertue onely.
But what is there, not onelye more
miserable, but also more fylthye, or yll

                     •
                  auoured, then to see a man afflycted
or ouercome wyth gryefe? To whyche

                     •
                  iserye, he trulye is verye nyghe, who

                     •
                  eareth anye euell when it it is comming,
and standes cōtinually in dread
of the same. The power whereof, the
Poetes myndinge to expresse, fayned

that in hell, a stoane hangeth ouer the
heade of Tantalus, for the mischieues
whyche he had done, and his proude
heart. And truly, it is the cōmon paine
of all follye. For all men, whose myndes
abhorre from reasō, haue alwayes
some gryefe, or feare hangynge ouer
them. And as these two, namely griefe
and feare, are motions, wastinge and
consuminge the minde: so, those which
are some what more merye (I meane
desyre, whiche dothe alwayes gredely
                     •
                  
coueyte some thinge, and vayne gladnes,
whyche is as muche as excessyue
mirth) do eyther nothynge at all or els
verye litle, differ from madnes.
               Wherby we may wel perceyue, what
maner of man he should be, whom we
call moderate, modest, temperate, constant,
and continent. Whiche wordes
also, we vse sometimes, to referre to
the name of frugalitie: as the chyefe of
all the rest. And trulye, vnlesse vnder
that name, al vertues were conteined:
this sayeng had neuer bene so cōmen,
that it had at these dayes purchased the
name of a prouerbe. Namelye, that a

a frugall man doth all thinges well.
               Which selfe same sayeng, the Stoikes
affyrme wyth great constancye, and
stoutenes. Whosoeuer therfore, hath
so fortifyed his minde with moderance
and constancye, that he is neyther pyned
with sorowe, nor discouraged with
feare, neyther gredely coueytinge anye
thyng, doth burne wyth desyre, neither
reioysing, with excessiue mirth, dothe
become effeminate: he is that mā whō
we seke. He is happy to whom neither
anye griefe shall seeme so intollerable,
that it may constraine him to abate his
courage: neyther yet any ioye so great,
that it shoulde cause him vainelye to
boaste and bragge of him selfe. For
what may seeme great to him, in thys
worlde, who museth on eternitye, and
knoweth the largenes of the wide
worlde? For what, either in the inuention
of man, or els in this shortenes of
life, may seeme straunge to a wise mā?
whose minde, is alwayes so watchefull,
that nothing can befal to him vnlooked
for, nothinge vnprouided, nor
straunge. Who also spreades his wyt

so farre on all partes, that he dothe alwayes,
see bothe place, and also tyme,
howe, and where he maye liue in tyme
of anguyshe. So y•, whatsoeuer chaūce
fortune shall caste on him, he will quietly
take it, and be content therewyth.
Which, whosoeuer doth, he shal want
not onelye gryefe of minde, but all the
other perturbations also. And trulye,
the minde being of them eased, is perfectly
and absolutelye happye. And the
same stirred and drawen bi them, from
sure and perfecte reason, doth lose not
onely constancy, but also, al his health.
Wherefore, fonde and effeminate is
the reason and talke of the Peripatetikes,
who thinke it necessary, that our
myndes should be troubled. But, they
appoynte a certayne meane, which we
ought not to exceede. Will you make
anye meane in vyce? Or is it no vice,
not to folowe reason? Or doth not reason
teache, that it is not good, eyther
thirstily to coueyte any thing, or when
thou hast obtayned it, to reioyce vaynelye?
Doth she teache, that it is no euel,
eyther to be ouercome, or els not to be

quiete in minde, because of sorowe?
               Doth not she shewe the: that all exceadinge
sadnes, or vayne myrthe, procedeth
of erroure? For let vs seeke some
meane in sorowe. For in it men take
most payne. Fanius wryteth, that
Publius Kutilius, toke greuouslye his
brothers repulse, when he stoode in election
for the Consulshippe. But it semeth
that he passed measure. For it
was the onelye cause of his death. He
ought then, to haue taken it more moderately.
But, what if whiles he tooke
this so greuouslye, the death of some of
his children had chaunced also? Then
there had also come a newe griefe. Neuerthelesse,
moderate: but yet it had
bene a great encrease of his former sorowe.
What, if then, there had ensued
some disease in his bodye, the losse of
goodes, blyndenes, banishemente, and
some newe gryefe, and a newe sorowe
for euerye one of theym? then it were
made the greatest gryefe that myghte
be: which could not be borne. So we se
that, who so euer sekes to appoyncte a
meane in anye vyce, dothe, like as if a

man would thinke, that one y• shoulde
cast him selfe downe from a rocke, into
the sea, myght staye him selfe, when
he would. For trulye, like as that can
not be, so, neyther can a troubled, or
moued minde, staye it selfe, where and
when it wil. Also, those thinges which
are yll, when they come to their rypenesse,
and proofe, those same also are
nought, when they are tender & yong.
But sorowe, and all other perturbations,
when they are encreased to the
most, are vndoubtedly pestilent. Therfore,
euen at the fyrst breeding they are
not wythout vyce. For when they are
departed once frō reason, they encrease
of theyr owne accorde: and ouer owne
frayletie flatters it: and so at the laste,
vnwares launches into ye depe, where
it can not stand. Wherfore there is no
difference, whether they allowe a mediocritie
of perturbations, or a meane
of vnryghtuousnes, slouth, and intemperaunce.
And he whych appoynteth a
meane in vyce, confesseth, that some
part thereof ought to be borne. Which
bothe is odious of it selfe, and also so

much the worse, as all vices are of slippery
nature, and beinge once begon in
anye man, do continually cause him to
fall and slyde into all noughtines. So
that, he can by no meanes, staye hym
selfe. Furthermore, what a thing is it
that the Parepatetikes saye, that these
perturbations, which we thinke ought
to be pulled out by the rootes, are not
onelye placed in vs of nature, but also
that the same was done for a greate
commoditye? For this is theyr sayeng.
Fyrst they commende anger hyghlye,
naming it the whet sloane of fortitude
and sayeng, that it enflameth the hertes
of men, more stoutely both agaynst
theyr enemies, and also agaynst a wicked
citesen: terminge theyr reasons
lyghte, who dyd thus perswade theym
selues. It is right that we should wage
this warre, that we shoulde fyghte for
our lawes, libertye, and countrey.
               These thinges, are of no force to enflame
oure courage (saye they) unlesse
anger be present. Neyther do they reason
thus of warriours onely. But they
thinke also, that there can be no seuere

iudgementes, without some sharpenes
of anger. Neither do they allowe anye
oratour, not onely being pleintife, but
also defendaunte, vnlesse he pleade angerlye.
Or, if he be not angry, yet both
in his wordes, and iestures, do fayne
anger: so that, his wordes, may kindle
and prouoke the hearers to anger. To
conclude, they thinke he is no mā, that
can not be angry. And that whyche we
call gentlenes, they terme lenitie: and
counte it a fault. Neyther do they onelye
commend this kynde of lust (for anger
as I haue already defyned it, is the
lust to reuenge) but saye also that that
other sorte of lust, or desire, was geuen
vs of nature for a greate commodytie.
For they thinke that no man can do
anye thinge notable, vnlesse he haue
an earnest luste, or desyre vnto it.
               Themistocles walked in the nyghte
tyme, in the open streete, because he
could not sleepe. The cause whereof,
when some men did enquyre, he aunswered,
that the triumphe of Milciades
would not suffer him to take hys reste.
who hath not harde, of the watchefulnes

of Demosthenes? who sayd that it
greued him very much, if he shuld here
any workemen vp afore hym. To conclude,
the chiefest Philosophers, should
neuer haue profyted so muche in theyr
studies, without a burning desire, and
zeale of learning. We haue heard, that
Pithagoras, Democritus, and Plato,
searched the farthest countreis that are
knowen, for knowledge. For where so
euer they harde, that there was anye
thing for them to learne, thether, they
thought, that they oughte to trauayle.
And thinke we, that they woulde so
haue done, wythout a great heat of desyre?
Nowe, sorowe it selfe, whyche I
sayde, that men oughte wyth all theyr
myght to flye, as an horrible and vgly
beast, they thinke to haue bene appointed
of nature, not without some singuler
cōmoditie. Which is, that it should
gryeue men for theyr faultes to be chastened,
rebuked, and put to shame. For
they seeme safelye to haue sinned, who
beare shame and reproche (whiche they
deserued for theyr faulte) wythout any
sorowe. It is better to haue his conscience

gnawed wyth repenta unce.
               Whereof proceeded that sayeng of Afranius,
who when his effeminate
sonne cryed out, alas I wretche, his seuere
father aunswered.
If one part grieue the, would to god,
that all did smart a like.
               
               ¶Also, the other two partes of sorowe
they saye, are profitable. Pity, to helpe
and relieue the calamitye, of su

                  lye tormented. Yea and that
emulation is not vnprofitable: whych
is, when we are agryeued, that eyther
we haue not attained that, which some
other hath, or els some other hathe obteined
the same, whyche we haue gotten.
But feare, if any man should take
away, then were all diligence (thynke
they) vtterlye gone. Which is chiefely
sene in them, whyche feare the lawes,
the officers, pouertye, shame, death, or
sorowe. All these thinges, they saye,
ought to be cut of, from theire ful styrryng
and liberty, but to be rooted out,
they thinke they neyther can, neyther
neede to be. So that, as in all other
thinges, so in this also, they thinke the

meane to be best. In whych reasons,
thynke you, that they speake any thing
to the purpose, yea or no?
            
            
               Hea.
               Truly,
they seeme to me, to speake very reasonably.
And therfore I looke, howe you
wylt aunswere them.
            
            
               Mar.
               I will
fynde some what to obiect agaynst thē.
But this one thinge before. Do you
marke, howe great modesty there was
emonges the Academikes? For they
speake playnelye to the purpose. The
Peripat
                     •
                  tikes, are aunswered of the
Stoykes. Let theym contende for me:
who neede not, but to enquyre what
is most likely to be true, in euerye question.
What is there then in this question,
whereby that may be tryed? farther
then the whyche the wytte of man
can not reache, the definition of perturbations:
whych I thynke, that Zeno
hath well expressed. For he dothe
thus defyne it. A perturbation, is a motion
contrarye to reason, and agaynste
the nature of the mind. Or more brieflye
thus. A perturbation, is a vehemēt
appetite, or lust. By vehement, be vnderstandeth
such an appetite, as should

farre swarue, from the constancye of
nature. What is there that I may say
agaynst these definitiōs? But these are
for the most parte, the wordes of wyse
and suttel disputers. But these termes
of the Peripatetikes, the heate of the
mynde, and the whetstones of vertue,
come oute of the Rhetoricians scooles.
But can not a man be stout, but when
he begins to stomake the matter. Truly,
that is a poynct of masters of fence:
howebeit, oftentimes in them also, we
see great modestye. They commen togither,
they cōpany together, they aske
questions one of another. So that they
seeme to be pleased, rather then angry.
But of their opinion, let there be some
one like Pacidianus, whom Lucilius
describeth wyth these wordes.

                     Ile kill him strayght, and beate hym
sure, if that be it you seke.
                     But first perhaps his chaunce maye
be, me in some place to stryke.
                     Afore my sword within his heart or
lightes I fasten maye.
                     I hate the slaue, and therfore nowe
no longer will I staye
                     
                        
Then til his sword out of his sheath
into his hand he take.
                     So much I long my hatefull wrathe
vpon his bloud to slake.
                  
               
               But wythout this dronken anger, we
see Aiar in Homere, comming out manye
times, wyth great mirth, when he
should fyght wyth Hector. Whose entrye
into the field, when he had put on
his armour, reioyced his felowes, and
feared his foes. Insomuche, that, (as
Homere wryteth) it repented Hector
him selfe, that he had prouoked hym to
battell. And they trulye; commoninge
gently, and quyetely, the one wyth the
other, afore they foughte, did not in
theyr very fyght, do any thyng angerlye,
or outragiouslye. I trulye thynke,
that not Torquatus, who gotte his
name by fyghte, did wyth an angrye
moode, take awaye the frenche mans

                     •
                  hayne. Neyther, that Marcellus was
therefore to be counted stoute, at Clastidium,
because he was angry. For Africanus,
because he is better knowen
vnto vs, for that he lyued but of late
yeares, I durst sweare, that he was not

then inflamed with anger, when he couered
with his Tergat, Marcus Halienus,
a Pelignian, & fastned his darte,
in the breste of hys enemye: of Lucius
Brutus, there is more doubt whether,
because of the vnmeasurable hate, that
he bare agaynste the Tirant, he ranne
more fiercely against Aruns or no. For
I vnderstande, that either of them, at
one course, slew the other. What nede
you, to bring in anger then? Hath fortitude
no force, vnlesse she beginne to
waxe madde? What? thynke you that
Hercules, whom this selfe same valyauntnes,
hath nowe placed in the hea

was angry, whē he fought with
the bore of Erimanthia, or wyth the
lyon of the wood Nemeus? Dyd Theseus
in a chafe, holde the bull of Marathonia,
by the hornes? Take heede,
that you ioyne not fortitude wyth
madnes. Whereas anger is full of all
lyghtenes. And fortitude, can not be
wythout reason. Al chaunces that may
happen to man, are to be despysed.
               Deathe is not to be feared. We must
thynke, all gryefe, and payne, tollerable.

These thynges, when a man mindeth
with him selfe, wyth a syncere

                     •
                  udgement, and reasonable decree: thē
is fortitude in him stronge, and stable.
Unlesse parchaunce they wil saye, that
such thinges, as are done vehementlye
and stoutelye, are done angerlye. But

                     •
                  rulye, Scipio, who was wonte to affyrme
that sayeng of the Stoykes, that
a wyse man was neuer angrye: in my
opinion was not angry with T. Gra

common wealth, to folowe him. I
knowe not, whether I my selfe did any
thinge stoutelye, when I bare office in
the commen wealth. But if I dyd any
such thing, trulye it was wythout anger.
Is there any thing that doth more
resemble madnes, then anger? why
                     •
                  he
Ennius did well terme, the beginning

                     •
                  f madnes. The coloure, voyce, eyes,
and breath, beyng scarse able as wel to
speake as to do any thing, what poynt

of health or wysedome do they declare▪
what may there be more foolyshe, then
Achilles in Homere? or then Againem
non scolding? for Aiax anger broughte
both to madnes, and also to death. Fortitude
therefore nedeth not the ayde of
anger. It is sufficiently furnished, armed
and ayded of it selfe. For after
theyr opinion, we may saye, that dronkennes,
is profitable for fortitude. And
so likewyse of madnes. Because, bothe
madde & dronken men, do many thinges
verye stoutelye. Aiax was at all times
stoute, but most of all in his madnesse.
For then he did a valiaunt feate,
when the Grecians, beinge readye to
flye, he onely ayded them, and renued
the batayle. Shal we therfore say, that
madnes is profitable? Weygh the definition
of fortitude. So shall you perceyue,
that it nedeth not anger. Fortitude
therefore, is an affection of the
minde, obeyeng the hye lawe of reason
in sufferyng thinges. Or the continuance,
of a stable and sure iudgement, in
the suffering or auoyding, of those thinges,
which seeme to be feareful & terrible.

Or, the knoweledge of such thynges,
as ought to be feared, & also of the
contraryes, continui
                     •
                  g a certayne and
a sincere iudgement of the same. Or
els, more bryefely, as Chrisippus doth
(for all y• former definitions, are made
by one Spherus, who according to the
iudgementes of the Stoykes, is expert
in defininge, and they are all in maner
lyke, but the one declareth some thinges,
mere playnely then the other.)
               Howe then sayeth Chrisippus? Fortitude,
is the knoweledge (sayeth he)
howe to beare, or suffer gryeues. Or it
is an affection of the minde, obeyinge
the hyghe lawe of reason, in bearynge
and sufferynge withoute all feare. Although,
we vse to scoffe at these philosophers,
as Carneades was wont, yet
I feare, least they onely, are to be counted
philosophers. For, whiche of these
definitions, doth not open vnto vs, the
opinion, which is hidden, and closed in
our mindes, of the nature of fortitude?
Whyche beinge opened, and knowen,
who is there that would seeke anye other
aide, for a warriour, iudge, or oratour.

Or would not thinke, that they,
wythout madnes or anger, could do any
thyng stoutely? Why? the Stoykes
when they proue, that all fooles are
madde, do they not rehearce, these thinges,
amonges theyr follye, and madnes.
Take awaye the perturbations,
and anger chiefelye, theyr reasons wil
seeme to be monsters. They reason
thus. We saye, that all fooles are mad
likeas we saye, that donge smels yll.
               But as donge doth not alwayes smell
yll, but when you stirre it, you shall
then perceyue it: so lykewise, an angry
man, is not alwayes angerd. but prouoke
him a litle, and then shall you see
him starke mad. What? this warlyke
anger, when it entreth into any house
what diuision maketh it, betwyxte the
man and wyfe, children, and all the
householde? Is it then profitable also?
Is there anye thinge, that a dysquyete
mynde, can better do, then a quiet and
constant? Or can any man be angrye,
wythout the disquieting of his minde?
Our countreymen therefore, whereas
all diseases of the minde, are greate

faultes and vices, yet, because none of
them was worse then anger, did terme
onely those, whych were angrye men,
si
                     •
                  ke persons. But an oratour trulye,
anger becometh not, and to dissemble,
is it not a shame? Do you thinke vs
then to be angry, whē we speake somewhat
earnestly, or vehemently in pleadinge?
Also, when the matters beynge
paste and gone, we wryte oracions, do
we then wryte angerly? Dyd any man
thinke that eyther Aesopus, pleaded being
angrye? or, that Accius, wrote in a
chafe? All thinges, are handeled more
notablye, and farre better, of some oratour,
then of ani stage plaier. But they
are handled by them, quietlye and peasablye.
Nowe, to commend luste, what
a toye of luste is it? You brynge for the
Themistocles, and Demosthenes, to
whome you ioyne also, Pythagoras,
Democritus and plato. What? do you

                     •
                  all earnest studye, a lust? which beinge
referred to the best sorte of thinges, yet
ought we to be quyet and stedfast. But
in praysing sorowe, of all others moste
detestable, what philosophers, do they

shewe them selues? But Afranins said
well.
If one part grieue the, would to god,
that all might smart alike.
               
               For he spake it, of a rechelesse, and a
dissolute yonge man. But we put our
question of a constant and a wise man.
And so let vs leaue that anger, to some
capitaine, or souldiour: whom we nede
not here to rehearce. For it is good, for
them to vse the motions of their minde
who can not vse reason. But we (as I
haue often heretofore sayd) put our question
of a wyse man. But emulation,
obtr
                     •
                  ctation, and pitye, are also profytable.
Why shouldest thou pitie a man
rather then helpe him, if thou canst?
Can we not be liberall without pitye?
We ought not to sorowe for other mē,
put if we can, to ease others of sorowe.
Nowe, obtrectation, and emulation,
whereunto are they profitable? since it
is the poynct of emulation, to be vexed
at an other mans commoditye, whiche
he him selfe hath not: and the nature of
obtrectacion is, to be gryeued, with the
prosperitye of an other, for that he hath

gotten the selfe same commoditie, that
we had. But who coulde fynde in his
heart, to come to the experience of thinges,
by sorowe? And the mediocritye of
euels, who can iustly commende? For,
who is there, in whome there is anye
lust, or desyre at all, y• is not a noughty
luster, & desirer of that, he should not?
               Or who is there, in whom ther is any
anger, that is not an angry person?
               Or who is there, in whom there is sorowe,
that is not soroweful? In whom
is there feare, that is not feareful? And
thinke you, that a wise man, maye be a
vicious desyrer, of that, he should not,
or an angrye, sorowefull, or fearefull
person? Of whose prayse, althoughe, I
could speake very much, yet thus much
I will briefely saye, that wisedome, is
the science, and knoweledge, of the proper,
& appointed causes, of euery thing:
as well in heauen as in earth. Wherby,
it appeareth, that it pursueth onely
such thinges, as are heauenly: & earthly
thinges, it doth subdue & rule, wyth
vertue: Did you then saye, that to him,
as a sea lyeng open for euerye wynde,

anye perturbation might chaunce.
               What is there, that coulde trouble so
greate grauitie, and constancie? Maye
some sodayne or vnprouided chaunce
do it? But what such thinge, may happen
to him, to whom no chaunce, that
may happen to man, doth come vnlooked
for? For whereas they saye, that
that, whych is ouermuche ought to be
cutte awaye, and that those thynges
onelye, whych are naturall, oughte to
be left: what one thing is there, engraffed
in vs of nature, of the whyche, we
haue ouer much? For all these thynges
sprynge oute of the rootes of erroure:
whych oughte wholye to be pulled vp,
and not to be pared, or cut away. But
because I thinke, you do not put youre
question of a wyse man: but of youre
selfe, or of some other commen person,
(for him perchaunce, you thinke to be
voyde of all perturbations) let vs see
what store of remedyes, philosophye
hath deuysed, to helpe the diseases of
the mind. For assuredly, there is some
medecine. For nature was not so cruelly
bent agaynst mankind, that wheras,

she hath inuented so manye remedyes
for the bodye, she woulde deuyse
none for the minde. Of which also, she
hath better deserued. For that whereas
the medecines of the body, are made
of thinges without the same: the helth
and helpes of the minde are closed
within it selfe. But looke, howe much
more noble, and heauenly theyr nature
is, so muche the more diligence they
neede to be cured. Reason therfore, being
in good plite, sees what is beste to
doe: But being neclected, or impure, it
is wrapped in many errours. To you
therfore now I must turne al my talke
For you fayne, that you put your question
of a wyse man. But, perhaps you
meane it by youre selfe. Of those perturbations
therfore, whych I haue rehearsed,
there are diuers and sundrye
remedyes. For all sorowe is not swaged
after one sorte. For, there is one
waye to helpe him that mourneth: an
other, to helpe him that pityeth: and
an other to helpe him that enuieth. Also,
there is this doubte in all the fower
perturbations, whether we oughte, in

consolatiōs, to applie our talke against
all perturbations generallye (whyche
are the despisinge of reason, or els a vehement
appetite) or els frame our persuasion,
agaynst euery singuler perturbation.
As agaynste feare; desyre, or anye
of all the reste. And whether we
ought is reason, whether this pryuate
chaunce, for the whyche he is so vexed,
ought patientlye to be borne: or els, to
shewe, that we must not be sorye for anye
chaunce. As if a man were pricked
with pouertye, whether, woulde you
proue vnto him, that pouertye is no euell
at all, or els, that a man oughte to
take no mischaunce heauily. This last
truly were the better: least, if you shuld
not perswade him, that pouertye is no
euel, you must nedes geue him leaue to
sorowe. But if you take awaye all maner
of gryefe, wyth suche reasons, as I
yesterday vsed: you shal in maner, take
awaye, all the euell of pouertye. But,
let euery such perturbation, be finished
with the quietnes of the minde. whych
comes, when you proue, that it is no
good, that we so desyre: or that causeth
vs, to reioyce: and that it is no euell,

whereof oure feare, or gryefe doth proceede.
And this is a sure and approued
remedye: to shewe, that the perturbations
them selues, are vicious. And, that
they are not in vs of nature: neyther
are caused by necessitye. As we see that
commenlye men swage their sorowe,
when we cast in theyr teeth, the weakenes
of theyr effeminate minde: & when
we commend vnto theym, theyr grauitie,
and stedfastnes, whych wythout anye
trouble, do beare the like. Whyche
trulye, is wonte sometimes to chaunce
to them, whyche thynke them to be e
                  
                     •
                  elles
in deede, and yet neuerthelesse,
that they are to be taken in good part.
As perchaūce, some man thinkes pleasure
to be a good thing: and some other
hath the same opinion of moneye: yet
neuerthelesse, both the one maye well
be stayed from ryot, and also the other
from coueteyse. But the other maner
of perswasion, whych doth assaye, both
to take away theyr fonde opinion, and
also to ridde theyr sorowe: is in deede,
more profitable. But it takes effecte
but feeld, And also, it is not to be ministred

to the commen people. Also, there
are some sortes of sorowes, which that
medecine can not helpe. As if any man
be aggryeued for the lacke, that he feeleth
in him selfe, of vertue, courage,
good behauiour, or honestye: he trulye,
were gryeued for a thynge, that is in
deede euell. But there muste be some
other salue ministred to him. And that
is such trulye, as maye well ynoughe
be a helpe of all the rest. For this euery
man ought to confesse, that although,
those thinges whych stirre vs to feare,
or sorowe, be euell, yea, or no: or those
thinges, whych cause vs to desyre, and
reioyce, be good, yea or no: yet assuredly,
that motion or stirring of the minde
is euell. For, we will, that he, whome
we terme a stout hearted, and valaiunt
man, should be constant, quiete, gra
                     •
                  e
and such a one, as should treade vnder
his feete, all chaunces, that might happen
to man. But such a one, can not be
a sorowefull, fearefull, desyrous, or a
fond, ioyous person. For, those thinges
are in such, as suffer chaunces to beare
dominion ouer them. Wherfore, thys

is one precepte, commen amonges all
philosophers, that we speake not of
that, whyche troubleth the minde: but
onelye of the perturbation it selfe. And
therfore, fyrste as concerninge desyre,
when we minde to take away that perturbation,
we must not alwayes reason,
whether that be good or no, which
moued vs to desyre: but the desyre it
selfe, must be taken awaye. So that,
whether honestye be the chiefest good,
and therfore chiefely to be desyred, or if
pleasure be it, or els both of theym ioyned
togyther, or all those three sortes
of goodes, namely of the minde, bodye
and fortune: yet neuerthelesse, if we vnto
much desyre, euen vertue it selfe: we
must vse the like meanes, to disswade
men from that, as we vse in al the rest.
Also, the description of the nature of
mā, being set afore our eyes, is a great
meanes to quiete our minde. Whych,
that they may more playnely beholde,
you muste describe in youre talke, the
commen state, and miserye of mannes
life. And therfore, it is reported, that
Socrates, not without cause, cut away

these three fyrste verses of Euripides,
from that tragedie, in the which he describeth
the historye of Orestes.

                     The fearefulst chaunce, that eyther
toung may tell, or eare may heare.
                     That chaūce may bring, or gods down
flynge, our troubled mindes to feare.
                     The nature yet, and hearte of man,
with pacience wel may beare.
                  
               
               ¶Also, to perswade, that it whiche is
chaunced, both may, and also ought to
be borne, the rehersall of many, whych
haue suffered the same, is very profitable.
Howebeit, we haue shewed, howe
sorowe might be swaged, both in oure
yesterdayes talke, and also in our boke
of consolation: whyche, (for I muste
nedes cōfesse: that I am no wise man)
I wrote in the middes of all my gryefe
and sorowe. And whereas, Chrisippus
doth forbyd vs to minister oure medecines,
when our minde is freshe swollen,
wyth the wound: yet I did it, and
ioyned thereunto, the whole strengthe
of my nature: that, the sharpnes of my
sorowe, myghte yelde, to the strength,
of the medecine. But next to sorowe (of

the which we haue sufficiently spoken)
comes feare. Of the whych also, somewhat
must be sayde. For as sorowe,
proceedeth alwayes, of some presente
griefe: so is feare alwayes caused, of
some griefe that is to come. And for
that cause, some sayde, that feare was
a certayne braunche of gryefe: other
some, sayd it was the forerunner and
guyd of gryefe. Wherfore, by the same
meanes, that we maye beare gryefe,
when it is presente, by the same also
we maye despyse it, that is likelye to

                     •
                  om
                     •
                  . For we must take great heede,
that in them both, we do nothing more
humblye, lowelye, wantonlye, effeminately,
or abiect like, thē it becometh a
man. But, although, we must treat of
the inconstancie, weakenes, & lyghtnes
of feare: yet it is good to despyse
those thinges, whiche most men feare.
And for that cause, whether it were by
chaunce, or els of set purpose, it hapned
very wel, that the first, and second
daye, we reasoned of those thinges,
whych men most of all feare, namelye
of death, and of payne. Our reasons of

the whyche, who so euer doth like, and
beare away well: he may easelye be rid
of feare. And hitherto we haue treated
of those perturbations, whych procede
of the opinion of some euell. Nowe, let
vs consider those, which are styrred, by
the opinion of some goodnes. Whyche
are ioy and desyre. And I thinke trulye
that of all perturbations of the minde,
there is one onely cause: and that, they
are al in our power: and, that we suffer
them to enter vpon vs, of oure owne
voluntarye free will. This erroure
therefore, and fayned opinion, must be
taken awaye, & as by reason, we make
those thinges, which seeme to be euell,
more tollerable, so we muste in those
thinges also, which are thoughte to be
greate and notable goodes, make oure
minde more quiete and peasible. And
this truly, is commen, as well to those
thinges, which are counted euell, as also
to those whyche are counted good:
that, if there be anye difficultie to perswade,
that those thinges, which trouble
his mind, are not good, or that they
are not euell, yet neuerthelesse, we

must haue a seuerall remedye for euery

               O notable poetrye, the amender of our
liues, whiche thinkes, that the loue of
sinne, and the ancthoure of all lyghtenes,
oughte to be placed emonges the
immortall Goddes. But, hitherto, I
speake of a comedye. Which consisteth
of nothing els, but such mischieues.
               But what sayeth the prince of the saylers
in the ship Argo, in a tragedie?
Thou sauedst me but for my loue,
and not mine honoures sake.
               
               This loue of Medea, what flames of
miserye did it kyndle? And yet neuerthelesse,
she in an other poete, dares to
saye to her father, that she had a husband.
Whom loue her gaue, whose force
did passe the dutie she ought him.
               
               ¶But let vs geue the Poetes leaue to
trifle, in whose tales, we see this vyce,
attributed to Iupiter him selfe. And
let vs come, to the Philosophers, the
maysters of all vertue. Whyche denye

that thereaboute contend muche with
Epicurus. Who therein, in my opinion,
lyeth nothinge. For what is this
loue, that men terme frendshippe? Or
why, doth no man loue a foule yonge
man, or a fayre olde man? Trulye, I
thinke, this custome began fyrst in the
vniuersities of Greece, in the whyche,
such loue is permitted. But well sayde
Ennius.

                     It is the cause of muche mischyefe,
and vyce as I suppose,
                     That men should vse in open syght,
theyr bodies to disclose.
                  
               
               Which sort of mē, if they be honest, (as
I think they may) yet is it not wythout
great paine and trouble. Yea, and that
so much the more, for that, they do, in
maner constrayne theym selues to refrayne.
And that I maye ou

                  rpasse the
loue of women, whiche is farre more
naturall then the other: who doubtes
what the Poetes ment, by the rape of
Ganimedes? Or who knoweth not
what Laius in E
                     •
                  ripides, doth bothe
speake and wyshe? Furthermore, who
seeth not, what songes and balades,

the most chiefest, and best learned Poetes,
set forth of theyr owne loues.
               Alceus, beynge a man of good reputation,
in the common wealth, yet what
toyes wrote he, of the loue of yonge
men? And all the wrytynges of Anacreon,
are onely of loue. But moste of
all other, Rheginus Ibicus, euen burned
with loue: as it appeareth by hys
wrytinges. And now, we philosophers
also, (yea and that, by the councell and
aucthoritye of Plato, whom Dicearchus
doth therfore worthely reprehēd)
are become the commenders, and honourers
of loue. For the Stoikes, both
saye, that euerye wyse man wyll loue:
and also, defyne loue, to be the desyre
to get amitie: stirred by the syghte of
beauty. Which, if it maye be wythout
care, desyre, & thought, I am well contented
to admit. For thē, it wantes the
perturbation of desyre. Agaynst the
whych, we at this presēt reason. But if
loue be, (as it is truly) not farre distant
from madnes, as it was in him of the
ile of Leucadia, who crieth out thus.
               If so in heauen be any god, that doth

for me take care.
               Nowe trulye, it were but reason, that
the gods should care, howe he myghte
obtayne his fleshely lust. Then he goeth
forwarde.
               Alas vnhappy man:
               Trulye, he spake nothinge in all his
talke, more true. But he aunswereth
hym well.
Maye I thinke, that thou thy wittes
wel hast, that dost so sore lament?
               
               So he seemes, euen to his owne companion,
to be madde. But hearke what
tragedies he makes.
On the Apollo, nowe I call, on Neptune,
and ye wyndes.
               
               He thinkes, that the whole world, wil
turne to helpe him. Uenus onelye, he
excludeth as vniust. Sayeng.
For wherfore should I nowe, call on
thy name O Uenus vayne.
               
               For her, he thinkes, for the delyghte,
that she takes in fleshelye pleasure, to
care for nothing els. As though he him
selfe, doth not both do and saye, all his
flagitious toyes, onely for fleshely pleasure.
Whosoeuer therfore, is herewith

diseased, ought thus to be cured. Both
by 
                     •
                  hewynge, howe light, howe fonde,
and also of how small effect, that thing
is, whych he doth desyre: or els, howe
ease lye in some other place, or by some
other meanes, he may obtayne his dedesire,
or vtterlye neglecte it. Also, he
muste sometimes be turned to other
thoughtes, cares, & busines Oftētimes
chaunge of place helpeth, likeas it doth
also, a diseased body. Also, some thinke
that olde loue is driuen awaye with
some newe fancye, lykeas, when wyth
one nayle, we dryue out another. But
chyefelye we must put him in mynde,
what madnes is in loue. For of all the
perturbations of the minde, there is
none more vehemente. So that, if you
would not blame it, for the whoredom
adultery, & other vicious actes, whiche
ensue thereupon: yet you must needes
hate it, because of it selfe, it is a perturbatiō.
For, that I may ouerpasse those
thinges, whych declare starke madnes
in it. Of what fondenes, are all these
th
                     •
                  nges, which seeme to be but meane?

                     
                     In loue are wrath, fierce hate, & truce,
with sower suspicions eke.
                     Nowe warre, then peace: which if that
thou, to make certayne dost seke
                     By reasons force: then sure I thynke,
thou shouldst do nothing more,
                     Then if thou seeke howe to be madde,
obeying reasons lore.
                  
               
               This inconstancye, and waueringe of
minde, onelye, whom is it not able to
feare? Also, we must shewe vnto them
that which is commen to euery perturbation:
that namelye, that they are all
taken of a fond opinion, and of oure
owne free wyll. For, if loue were naturall,
bothe all men shoulde loue, and
also be loued, and shoulde at all tymes
loue, yea, and all men one thing. Neyther,
should shame, thought, or satietie
feare any man from the same. But anger,
although it doth longe trouble the
minde, yet it is not taken to be madnes:
by force of the whych, there riseth
sometimes, euen amonges brethren
such like chiding.

                     What man in shameles impudence
could any time passe thee?
                     
                        
Naye, who, in cankerd malice could
thy better euer be?
                  
               
               You knowe what foloweth. For, verse
for verse, there are very quicke tauntes
betwyxte those brethren. So that it
maye lightlye appeare, that they were
the sonnes of Atreus. Who museth,
howe to inuent some straunge cruelty,
agaynst his brother.

                     A greater payse of mischiefe nowe,
doth lye vpon my necke.
                     In musinge howe, his stubburne heart
and stomacke I may breake.
                  
               
               Wyll you knowe what payse, or loade
of mischiefe, this is? Then heare Thyestes
sayeng.
My wycked brother, counsayles me,
my childrens fleshe to eate.
               
               Lo he sets the bowelles of his children
afore him. For what crueltie is there,
to the whych, anger, & madnes woulde
not perswade a mā? And for that cause
we do well saye, that angrye men are
out of theyr owne power. By the whiche,
we meane, that they are wythoute
counsell and reason. Whych onelye,
ought to rule our mindes. From suche

men, we must remoue them, on whom
they would gladly auenge them selues
till such time, as they come agayne to
thē selues. Which, what other thinge
is it, then to bryng home, the scattered
partes of the minde, into their owne
place? Or els we must desyre and entreat
them, that if they haue any great
desyre to reuenge: yet they would differre
it, to some other time, till theyr
anger coale. For, in theyr anger, the
heate of theyr minde, doth euen boyle
agaynst reason. For the whyche cause,
the sayenge of Architas, is much commended.
Who, being angry with one
of his hindes, sayde. O howe would I
haue beaten the, vnlesse I had bene angry?
Who be they then, that saye, that
anger is profitable? (so may madnes be
profitable) or naturall? Can any thing
be naturall, which is contrarye to reason?
Also, yf anger were geuen vs of
nature, howe should one man be more
angrye then another? Or, howe could
any man be sory for that, which he had
done in his anger? As we haue heard
of kynge Alexander, who when in hys

rage, he had caused his very frend Clitus,
to be put to death, afterwards, for
sorow he would haue slayne him selfe.
So much it did repent him. Wherfore
is there any doubt, but that this motition
also, doth wholye consiste in oure
owne opinion, and will? For, who
doubteth, that all diseases, suche as coueytousnes
and desyre of glorye are: do
rise, and are caused hereof: namely, for
that we haue those thinges, of the
whyche they take theyr beginninge, in
great reputatiō? Wherfore, we do wel
perceyue, that euery perturbation, consisteth
in opin
                     •
                  on. And, if boldenes, be
a certayne and sure knoweledge, and a
constant opinion, not agreing rashely
to any thing: then is feare, a mistrust,
and doubt of some euell, that we looke
for euen at hande. And, if hope, be the
expectation of some good thinge: then,
is feare the expectacion of some euell
thing. As feare ther
                     •
                  ore, so al the other
perturbatiōs also, are of the number of
euels. And, as constancie, is caused of
knowledge: so doth perturbatiō procede
of erroure. But, such, as are sayd naturallye

to be angry, pitifull, enuious, o
                     •
                  
any such like: they truly, haue an il constitution
of theyr mindes. But neuerthelesse,
they may well be healed. As it
is reported of Socrates, in whome,
whē one Zopirus (which professed the
knowledge of euery mans disposition,
by the syghte of his face,) had reckened
vp a great number of vices, in the presence
of some of the frendes of Socrates,
who knewe, that he was not
faulty in theym: they laughed him to
scorne. But Socrates, defended him.
               Sayeng, that those sygnes and coniectures
were in him in deede. But, that
he did ouercome them wyth reason.
               Wherefore, as men beinge in good
health, may seeme yet, some more then
other, to be giuen, to this or that disease:
so likewyse some mans mynde is
more prone to vice, then some others.
But their vices, who are not of nature
but onely be theyr owne fault vicious,
consiste, of the false opinions of those
thinges, which they count eyther good
or euell. And a disease once rooted, like
as in the bodye, so in the minde also, is

hardly holpen. For, easier it is, to heale
a sodayne swellinge, of the eyes, then a
continuall blearynesse. So, the cause of
al perturbations, being once knowen,
whyche take theyr beginninge, of the
sundrye iudgementes, of opinions, we
will here finishe this dayes disputation.
For the endes of good, and euell,
beynge knowen, as muche as a man
may knowe them, nothynge more profitable,
maye be wyshed, or desyred, of
all Philosophye, then those thynges,
which in these foure daies we haue discussed.
For, to the despysynge of death,
and bearynge of all bodilye payne, we
ioyned the ease of sorowe. Then the
whiche, there is nothinge more troublous,
to man. For although euerye
perturbation be greuous vnto vs, and
doth not muche differ frome madnes:
yet, when men are in anye of the other
perturbations, as feare, myrth, or desyre,
we saye, that they are but troubled,
or disquieted. But, those that are
subiecte vnto sorowe, we terme wretched,
afflycted, and full of calamitye.
               And for that cause, it was not by

chaunce, but well, and aduisedly
                     •
                  , appoynted
by you, that we made a seuerall
discourse of sorowe, from all the other
perturbations. For, in it, is the
sprynge and fountayne, of all miserye.
But there is one waye, to helpe, bothe
it, and also al the other diseases of
the minde. Namely, by the shewynge,
that they are caused onelye, by oure
owne fond opinion and will, because
we thinke it ryght, and dutye, to take
them on vs. This erroure, as the roote
of all euell, philosophye promiseth to
pull vppe, euen by the rootes. Let vs
therefore, yelde our selues to it, and suffer
it to heale vs. For, as long as these

                     •
                  uels are wythin vs, we shall neyther
be happye, nor whole. Eyther let vs
therefore playnelye denye, that reason
can do any thing (whereas in dede, nothynge
can well be done without it) or
els, inasmuch as philosophie consisteth
of the conference of reasons: of her, (yf
we wil be eyther good, or blessed) let
vs learne the helpes, to attayne to a
happye, and a blessed lyfe.

            THE FYFT AND LAST
booke of M. Tullie Cicero:
contayning his reasoninge of the
last and fifte question, which he disputed,
in his manor of Tusculanum
being this in effecte, whether vertue
onely, be sufficient to make a man
leade a happye lyfe.
            
               
                  THis fyfte daye
(fryende Brutus)
shal make an ende
of our disputations
holden in our manor
or Tusculanū:
in the whiche, we
reasoned of that Question, which you,
most of all others are wont to allowe.
For I perceiued, both by y• boke, which
you wrote vnto me, & also bi your talk,
at manye other times, that you like
this opinion very well. Namelye, that
vertue is sufficiente of it selfe, to the
mayntayning of a happy and a blessed
life. Which although it be verye harde
to proue, because of so manye and sundrye
strokes of fortune: yet neuerthelesse,

suche it is, that we oughte to trauayle,
and take paynes for the proofe
thereof. For, there is nothing in al philosophye,
more grauely or more wisely
spoken. For, inasmuch, as it moued all
those, that first gaue them selues to the
studye of philosophye, despysynge all other
thinges, to setle thē selues, wholye,
to the searchinge of the happyest
state of lyfe: trulye, they tooke so great
trauayle, and paynes, onely in hope, to
attayne a blessed life. And truly, if such
men, haue eyther found out, or accomplyshed
vertue: and if they found sufficient
ayde in onelye vertue, for the attayninge
of a blessed lyfe: who woulde
not iudge, that well, and worthelye,
both they did fyrst inuent, and we also
haue, folowed, the studie of philosophy?
But, if, vertue beinge subiecte, to sundrye
and vncertayne chaunces, is the
slaue of fortune, and not of sufficiente
ability, to mayntayne her selfe: I feare
muche then, least it be all one, to truste
to the ayde of vertue, for the obtaining
of a blessed life, & to sit still, a
                  •
               d wishe
after the same. In deede, remembring

manye times, the chaunces, wyth the
whyche, fortune hath galled me. I beginne
to mistruste this opinion, and to
feare, the weakenes, and frayletye of
mankynde. For, I am wonte to feare,
least, inasmuch as, nature hath geuen
vs weake bodyes, to the whyche also,
she hath fastned sundrye sortes of incurable
diseases, & intollerable grieues:
least, she (I say) hath likewise geuen vs
mindes, agreable to the diseases & greues
of our body. And also of thē selues,
wrapped in other seuerall cares & troubles.
But, in this poynct, I correct my
selfe. For that, I iudge of the strength
of vertue, according to the wantonnes
and weakenes of other, yea, and perchaunce
of my selfe: and not by vertue
it selfe. For vertue trulye (if there be anye
such thing at all, whyche doubt, if
there were any, your fathers brother,
(O Brutus) hath already taken away)
hath vndoubtedly, all chaunces whych
may happen to man, in subiection vnder
it: and despysyng theym, contempneth
all worldly casualtye: and, beyng
it selfe, voyde of all blame, thinketh,

that nothing besides it it selfe, is requisite
vnto it. But we, encreasing all aduersitie,
while it is comminge, wyth
feare: and whē it comes, wyth sorowe:
will condemne rather those thinges,
whyche natural
                  •
               ye are good, then oure
owne pernicious erroure. But as well
of this faulte, as also, of all the rest, we
must seeke the redresse, in philosophye.
Into whose bosome, beinge, in the very
beginninge of my age, led by myne
owne will, and earneste desyre: nowe,
after that I was tost, wyth most troublesome
stormes, I haue euen fled to
the same, as to the hauen, from the
whych I once departed. O philosophy,
the guyde of our lyfe, the searcher of
vertue, the expeller of vice, what were
not we onely, but generally, all the life
of man able to do wythout thee? Thou
foundedst cityes, thou reclaymedst
men, whiles they were yet wylde and
wanderers, to a commen societye and
feloweshippe of life: thou bredst loue
betwyxt theym: fyrste by neyghbourhoode,
nexte by mariage, and laste of
all by communicatinge of talke, and

wrytinge. Thou, wast the inuenter of
lawes, the mistres of maners, and of
all good order. To the we flye, of the
we aske succour. To the, euen as afore
for some part, so nowe, I geue my selfe
wholye, to be ruled and gouerned. For
one daye, wel spent, accordinge to thy
preceptes, is to be preferred, wel night
afore immortality. Whose ayde therefore,
should we rather vse, then thyne?
Who, both hast graunted vs, the quietnes
of lyfe, and also, hast taken from
vs, the feare and dread of death. But,
so muche it lackes, that philosophye is
so much commended, as it hath deserued
of the life of man, that it is, of the
most part, neglected, & of many wholy
dispraysed. Who woulde thynke, that
any man durst, to disprayse the parent
of his life, and so defyle him selfe with
parri
                  •
               ide? and shewe him selfe so vnnaturallye
vnkynde, as to disprayse her,
whych he ought to feare, yea though he
could not vnderstande? But I thynke,
this errour and miste, is bredde in the
heartes of the vnlearned, because, they
are not able to discerne the truthe: and

for that cause, thinke, that they were
not philosophers, who did fyrste helpe,
to garnyshe the lyfe of man. And truly
though this studye, of it selfe, be moste
auncient of all others: yet the name is
but newe. For, wysedome trulye, who
can denye to be ryght auncient, as wel
in deede, as in worde? whych, obtayned
this worthy name, amonges the auncient
sages, for that, it doth consiste, of
the knoweledge, as well of heauenlye
thinges, as earthlye: Of the beginninges,
causes, and nature of euerye
thinge. And for that cause, those seuen
whych of the Greekes, are called Sophi
o
                  •
               r forefathers, both counted, and also
named wyse. So called they Licurgus
likewyse, many yeares afore, in whose
time it is reported that Homere liued,
afore y• building of our citye. We haue
heard also, that, when the halfe gods liued
on the earth, Ulixes, and Nestor,
both were in deede, and also were called
wise. Neyther truly, had it bene reported,
that Atlas sustayneth the heauen,
or that Prometheus lyeth 
                  •
               ounde
to the hill Caucasus, or that Cepheus

is placed amonge the starres, wyth his
wife, sonne in lawe, and doughter: vnlesse
theyr knoweledge in heauenlye
matters, had fyrst caused, such tales to
be raised of their names. Whom, all
the rest that since haue folowed, and
placed theyr studye, in the contemplation
of the nature of thinges: were,
both counted, and also named wyse.
            Which name continued vntil the time
of Pithagoras. Who (as Heraclides
borne in Pontus, a scoler of Plato, a
man verye well learned doth wryte)
came to Phliuns, a citie in Greece.
            And there, reasoned bothe learnedlye
and largelye, wyth Leo the chyefe of
the same towne. Whose wyt, and eloquence
Leo wonderinge at, asked of
him, in what arte he was mooste perfecte.
Whereunto, he aunswered, that
he knewe no arte. But, that he was, a
louer of wysedome. Leo, wonderynge
at the straungenes of the name, asked
of him, who were those louers of wisedome.
And what difference was, betwyxte
them, and other men. Whereunto,
Pithagoras aunswered, that the

lyfe of man myght well be resembled,
to that fayre, whych, wyth al pompe of
playes, al Greece is wont to frequent,
and solēpnyse. For, like as there, some
by the exercise of theyr bodyes, woulde
assaye to winne some game, & crowne:
and, some other, came thither, for the
desyre to gayne, by byeng and sellynge
and also, there was a thirde sorte, farre
passing al the rest, who sought neither
game, nor gaynes, but came thither
onelye to beholde, and see, what was
done, and howe: so likewyse we comminge
into this life, as it were into a
great frequented fayre, or market, seke
some for glory, and some for money.
            But very fewe, there are, which despisynge
all other thinges, woulde studye
the contemplatiō of nature. But those
(he sayde) were they, whome he called
the louers of wisedome. And like as
there, it is counted a greater worship,
to come for the syghte of thinges, than
to medle wyth byenge and sellynge:
euen so lykewyse in this lyfe, the contemplacion
and knowledge of thinges
did farre excell all other worldlye troubles.

Neyther truly, was Pythagoras
onely, the inuentour of this name, but
also an increaser of the studye it selfe,
Who, when after this communication
at Phliuns, he came into Italy, enstructed
that countrey, whych is nowe
called great Greece, bothe priuatelye,
and also openlye, wyth moste notable
orders, and artes. Of whose doctryne,
perhaps, we shal haue some more commodious
time to speake. But that philosophye,
whych in auncient time was
in vse, till the time of Socrates, who
was the hearer of Archelaus, the scoler
of Socrates: dyd onelye treate of
numbers, and motions, and whereof
al thinges were made, and whereinto
they did ende. They did also curiouslye
search out the quantity, distaunce, and
courses of the starres, and other heauē
               ly
bodyes. But Socrates, fyrste of all,
turned philosophy, from the consideration
of the heauenly motions, and placed
it in cityes, and brought it, euen into
our housen: makynge it, to reason of
our life, and maners: of al thinges that
are good and euell. Whose sundrye

kinde of reasoninge, wyth the varietie
of the thinges them selues, and the sondrye
compasses of mens wits, made diuers
sectes of dissenting philosophers.
Of all the which, I folowe that, which
I suppose Socrates dyd vse. Namelye,
to conceale, mine owne opinion, and
reproue other mens errours. And, in
al reasoning, to enquere, what is most
likely to be true. Which custome, inasmuche
as, Carneades did continue,
maruaylous wittelie, and copiously: I
also, enforced my selfe to do the same,
of late, in my maner of Tusculanum.
And the talke of our firste foure dayes,
I haue already sent vnto you, reported
in as many bookes. But the fyft daye,
whē we came to our accustomed place,
thus began our reasoninge.
            
               Hea.
               I
thinke, that vertue is not sufficient of
it selfe, to make a happye and a blessed
lyfe.
            
            
               Mar.
               Trulye, my frende Brutus
thinkes the contrary. Whose iudgement
(you must geue me leaue to saye
my fancie) I do alwayes preferre afore
yours.
            
            
               Hea.
               I do not doubte thereof,
neyther is it nowe in controuersy, how

much you loue him. But I woulde
heare your opinion, what you thynke
of that whych I haue proposed.
            
            
               Mar.
               Do you denye, that vertue of it selfe, is
sufficient, to make a mans life blessed?
            
            
               Hea.
               Yea truly.
            
            
               Mar.
               What? maye not
a man with vertue onely liue wel, honestly
and laudablye?
            
            
               Hea.
               Yes trulye.
            
            
               Mar.
               Can you then saye, that either he
whiche liueth yll, is not wretched? or
that he, whyche liueth well, liueth not
also happelye?
            
            
               Hea.
               What els? for,
euen in tormentes, a man maye lyue
well, honestly, and commendably.
               So, you vnderstand, howe I meane to
liue wel. Which is, to liue constantly,
grauelye, wyselye, and stoutelye. For,
these do sticke by a man, euen when he
is on the racke. Yet there is no happye
life.
            
            
               Mar.
               Why so? wil you shut a blessed
life onely, oute of the prison doare?
when constancye, grauitye, fortitude,
and wysedome, may enter wythin the
same? and refuse no pryson, punyshemente,
nor payne?
            
            
               Hea.
               Trulye, if you
minde to moue me, you must seke some
other reasons then those: not onely, because

they are commen: but also, because
like as colde wines haue no taste
in the water: so these reasons delyghte
me, rather in the fyrst taste, then when
I haue dronke them vp. As this whole
companye of vertues, when it cometh
to tormentes, placeth images and shades
afore our cies, with great maiesty:
so, that it would seeme, that blessed life
would euen strayghte wayes, come to
them, and not suffer them to thynke,
that she would forsake them. But whē
you haue, once turned youre minde,
from these pictures and shades, to the
thinge, and truth it selfe: then there is
this onely left bare, whether any man
may be happy, as longe as he is in torment.
Wherefore, hereof let vs reason
But you nede not to feare, least the vertues
should complayne, that they are
forsaken, betrayed, and left of a happy
lyfe. For, if there can be no vertue
wythoute prudence, prudence it selfe
must nedes foresee, that all good men,
can not be happye. She remembreth
many historyes, of Marcus Attilius,
Quintus Cepio, and Marcus Aquilius,

and such others. And (if you thinke
good, rather to vse the allusion of the
images, then the thinges them selues)
euen stayes her, when she would come
to the racke, or to any other place of torment.
Sayeng, that she hath nothyng
to do, wyth gryefe, and torment.
            
            
               Mar.
               I am well contented, to reason,
euen after your appoyntment. Howebe
it you do me wrong, in prescribyng
me an order, howe you will haue me
reason. But fyrst, I aske this, whether
we haue concluded any thing, al the other
dayes?
            
            
               Hea.
               Yea, and that verye
much.
            
            
               Mar.
               If it be so, then, is this question
almost, fullye aunswered.
            
            
               Hea.
               Howe so?
            
            
               Mar.
               Because, all troublesome
mocions, sodayne, and vnaduysed
tossinges of the minde, despysynge
all 
                     •
                  eason, leaue vs no parte of a blessed
lyfe. For, who is there that feareth
eyther death, or gryefe, (of the whiche
the one chaunceth verye often, and the
other dothe alwayes hange ouer oure
heades) that is not wretched? Also, if
any man (as the moste parte do) dothe
feare pouertie, shame, or infamy: yf any

dread weakenes, blyndnes, or (that
which hath hapned, not onelye to pryuate
men, but euen to whole nations)
bondage. May any man, that feareth
these thinges, be happy? Also, he, whiche
doth not onely feare suche thinges,
when they are coming: but also can not
beare nor suffer them, when they are
present: as banishement, mournynge,
barennes: he, I saye, who beinge ouercome
with these, and suche like, dothe
yelde to sorowe: must he not nedes be
wretthed? Furthermore, he that is enflamed,
and euen rageth wyth desyre:
rashely desiringe all thinges, wyth an
vnsatiable gredines: and howe muche
the more plenty he hath of pleasure, so
much the more, thirsting, and desiring
the same: him (I saye) myghte you not
wel thinke, to be of all others most miserable?
Also, he that is euen puffed vp
with lyghtnes, and fondlye reioyceth
in his vayne mirth: is he not so muche
more miserable, as he seemeth to hym
selfe to be happyer? Wherfore, as, all
those whom we haue rehearsed, are
wretched: so, they contraryewyse, are

blessed, whome no feares affraye, no
gryeues consume, no lust en
                     •
                  lames, no
vayne ioye, or effeminate pleasures do
puffe vp. And, like as the sea, is then
thoughte to be calme, when no little
puffe, doth rayse anye waues at all: so,
that is thoughte, to be the quiete and
peasible state of the minde, when as,
it is voyde of all perturbations, that
may eyther moue or styrre it. Whiche,
if it be so, then, he, that counteth the
strokes of fortune, and all chaunces,
that may happen to man, tollerable: so
that, for theym, neyther feare can vexe
him, neyther sorowe torment him. He
so, if he be neyther troubled with desire
neyther, haue his minde puffed vppe,
wyth any vayne pleasure: what cause
is there, why he should not be happye?
And, if all these thinges, are broughte
to passe by vertue, what cause is there,
why vertue of it selfe can not make vs
happye?
            
            
               Hea.
               Trulye, this can not be
denyed, but that those, whych are troubled,
neyther with feare, sorowe, desire
nor mirth, must nedes be happy. Therfore,
that I graūt you.
            
            
               Mar.
               And truly,

thother is not vnproued. For we shewed
in oure former disputations, that,
a wyse man, wanted all perturbations
of the minde. So this question, semeth
to be fullye aunswered.
            
            
               Hea.
               Almost
in deede.
            
            
               Mar.
               But this is the maner
of the Mathematicians, and not of philosophers.
For, the Geometricians,
when they will proue any thynge, if it
pertayne to any of those thinges which
they haue afore proued, they take all
those thinges afore proued as thinges
that ought to be graunted, and are vndoubted.
And onely expre
                     •
                  se those thinges
wherof they wrote nothing afore.
Philosophers, what so euer thing they
haue in hand to proue, bringe in forthwith
all thinges, that are appliable to
the proofe of the same. Althoughe they
haue wrytten thē, in some other place,
afore. For otherwyse, what needed the
Stoykes, in prouinge, that vertue is
sufficient, to make a blessed lyfe, to vse
so manye wordes? whereas, it were
enough for theym, to aunswere, that,
they had shewed afore, that nothing is
good, but that which is honest. Which
being graunted, it must nedes folowe,

that a blessed lyfe may, be attayned by
vertue onely. And, like as this doth folowe
vpon that, so lykewyse, by the other,
this is concluded. That, if vertue
onely will brynge vs to a happye lyfe,
then no other thinge can be good, but
that which is honest. Yet neuerthelesse
they do not so. For, both of honestye,
and also of the chiefest good, and felicitie,
they haue wryten seueral bookes.
               And, although, it be hereof sufficiently
proued, that vertue is able enoughe of
it selfe, to bringe vs to a blessed lyfe: yet
neuerthelesse, they make a seueral discourse,
more at large of the same. For
euery question, must be handeled with
his owne propre reasons, proofes, and
admonitions, especially being so notable,
and so large, as this is. For, I
would not haue you thinke, that, there
is any thinge more cleare in all philosophye,
or that there is any promisse of
the same more plentifull, then this is.
For, marke wel, what it doth professe.
Namely, to bryng to passe, that who so
euer doth obeye the lawes of vertue,
should be alwayes armed, agaynst fortune,

and shoulde haue in him, all the
aydes, of a blessed and happy lyfe. And
to conclude, that he should be alwayes
happye. But we wil talke in other places,
of the effectes of philosophy. In
the meane time, I esteme that greatly
whyche she promyseth. For Xerxes, being
glutted wyth all the rewardes and
gyftes, that fortune myght gyue: not
contented, wyth an infinite companye
of horsemen, and footemen, with a
wonderful sayle of ships, nor yet with
innumerable store of golde, proposed a
rewarde for him, that could deuise any
straunge pleasure. For filthy lust hath
no end nor measure. I would we could
get one, who for hope of reward would
make vs beleiue this more stedfastlye.
            
            
               Hea.
               I would wyshe so lykewyse. But
I haue one thing to saye vnto you. For
I do well agree, that of those thinges,
whyche you euen nowe rehearsed, the
one doth well folowe vpon the graunt
of the other. Namely, that, lyke as if it
be graunted, that onely, that whiche is
honest, is good: it must needes folowe
that happy life consysteth in onely vertue:

so if happy life do consist in vertue
onely, then it must nedes be, that there
is nothing good but onely vertue. But
youre fryende Brutus, folowynge the
aduise of Aristo, & Antiochus, thinketh
not so: for he thinketh, that there are
other sortes of goodes, besides vertue.
            
            
               Mar.
               What? thinke you that I will at
this time, reason against him?
            
            
               Hea.
               Therein do as you shall thinke good.
               For it is not my part, to appoynt you.
            
            
               Mar.
               Then, to shewe, howe these conclusions
folow, the one vpon the other,
we wil deferre it to some other time.
               For herein, whē I was captiue, being
at Athenes, I dissented, both from Antiochus,
and Aristo. For I thoughte,
that no man might be happye, as long
as he might be in any euell. And truly,
a wyse mā may be combred with euels
yf those, which they cal the euels of the
bodye, and of fortune, be anye euels at
all. Hereunto, this was aunswered,
which also, Antiochus hath wryten in
many places. Namely that vertue of it
selfe, may make a blessed life. But not
the most blessed, that may be. Also that
many thinges, take their name of the

greater part, although some parte dyd
want or misse. As we call men strong,
helthfull, riche, honourable, glorious,
because they haue a great parte of such
thinges in theim, althoughe they haue
not the thinges thē selues, as perfecte,
as they might haue. So likewise, a blessed
life, they sayd, although it halted in
some part: yet it toke his name of the
greater part. I nede not now curiously
to pike out these thinges. Howebeit
they seeme to me, to be spoken scarse cō
                  stantly.
For both, I can not vnderstād,
what he that is happye, should lacke to
make him selfe more happye: (for if he
lacke any thing then is he not happye
at al). And also, whereas they say, that
euerye thinge is named of the greater
part, that is true in some other thinges
and not in this. But whereas they say
that there are thre sortes of euels: shall
we say (I pray you) that he, that is burdened
with the .ii. first sortes, namely,
eyther with the aduersitye of fortune,
orels wyth diseases in his bodye, doth
therfore want any thinge of a happye
life? Or of the happyest of all?
               This is it that Theophrastus woulde

not say. For when he had wryten, that
strypes, tormentes, punishementes,
the rasinge of our countrey, exyle, barennes,
& such like, were able to make
our life miserable, he was ashamed to
speake stoutely, inasmuche as he wrote
so fayntly, Although he doth not iustly
complayne, yet truly he is constante in
his owne opinion. And therfore, I like
not them, who when they haue graunted
the originall, yet will denye or reproue
that, whyche necessarilye dependeth
thereof. For they reprehende this
moste excellente, and learned philosopher.
But slenderly, for that he appointeth
three sortes of goodes. Yet they al
reproue him in that booke, whiche he
wrote of the attayning of a happy lyfe.
For that, he reasoneth muche, that he
which is in torment, can not be blessed
In that booke also, they thinke he sayeth,
that to the whele (which is a kinde
of torment among the Grecians) happie
life cannot come, trulye he saieth in
no place so. But he saies as much in effect.
And truly, if I should graunt to anye
man, that the grieues of the bodye

or the shipwrackes of fortune, ought to
be counted euels: could I be iustlye angrye,
wyth the same, if he should saye,
that then, al good men are not blessed?
For as much as, such euels, might happen
to the best mē that myght be. The
same Theophrastus, is bayted at, as
wel in the bookes, as in the scooles of
all philosophers, for that he commended
this sayeng of Calisthenes.
Not wysedomes lore, but fortunes
force, this world loe doth rule.
               
               They say, that no philosopher, myght
haue spoken any thing more fayntly.
               And therein in deede they saye well.
               But yet I can not see, howe he myght
speake more constantli, folowing their
opiniō. For, if there be so many goods
in the bodye, and so many wythout the
body, subiect to casualtye and fortune:
is it not probable, that fortune, whych
is the ruler of all outward thinges, pertayning
to the body, should beare more
swaye in our life then prudence? Or rather
should we folowe Epicurus, who
oftentimes speaketh many thinges very
wisely? but litle cares, how constant

and agreable he be in his talke. He
cōmendeth bare liuing. And truly, so it
becomes a philosopher. If Socrates or
Antisthenes, had said it, & not he, who
esteemeth pleasure to be the ende of all
goodes. He denies, that any man may

                     •
                  lue pleasauntly, vnlesse he liue honestly,
wysely, and iustly. Truly, nothynge
could be more sagely spoken, nor more
worthye a philosopher. Unlesse, he dyd
referre that same honestye, wysedome,
and iustice, to pleasure. What can be
better spoken, then that a wise man
oughte to be contented, wyth a meane
and bare life? But doth he saye this?
Who inas much as, he hath not onely
sayde, that gryefe is the chiefest euell,
but also, that it onelye is euell: maye,
euen then, when he shal boast him selfe
moste agaynste fortune, be ouercome
wyth a litle gryefe in his bodye? the
same also, Metrodorus spake in stouter
wordes. Sayenge, I haue nowe taken
the captiue O fortune, and stopped vp
all thy holes, so that thou mayst by no
meanes come vnto me. A notable sayenge,
if it had bene spoken, eyther of

Aristo, Chius, or Zeno the Stoyke.
               Who would thinke nothing euell, but
that whych were dishonest. But thou,
O Metrodorus, which hast placed all
good in dayntie dishes, and delicate feedinge,
and haste defyned that to be the
chiefest good, that doth consiste in the
good health of the bodye, and the certayne
hope, that it shall so endure:
               Hast thou (I saye) shut vp all the holes

                     •
                  f fortune? How: I pray the. For, that
whiche thou thinkest to be so greate
good, thou mayst lyghtye lose. But,
these are your baytes, for suche, as are
vnlearned, and such sētences haue caused
so manye to be of that sect. But it
is the poynct of a wyse reasoner, not to
waye what euerye man doth saye, but
what they ought to saye. As in thys
selfe same position, which is nowe proposed
to dispute: I saye, that all good
men are happye and blessed. Whom I
name good, it is playne enough. For
such as are adourned with all kinde of
vertues, we terme both wyse and good
men. Nowe, let vs see, whom we call
blessed. Truly I thinke, those whyche

enioy such thinges, as are good, without
the entermedling of any euell. For
truly, when we call anye man blessed,
we vnderstand thereby, no other thing
thē the perfect conioyning of such thinges,
as are good, seuered, and disioyned,
from all those thinges that are
euell. It, vertue can neuer attayne, yf
there be any thing good besides it. For
there wil alwaies be at hand, a throng
of euels (if we maye well terme theym
euels) such as pouerty, basenes of birth
solitarines, the losse of fryendes, greuous
infyrmities of the bodye, the losse
of health, weakenes, blyndnes, the captiuitie
of our countrey, banishemente,
and bondage) In these, and such lyke, a
man may be good, and wyse. For these
thinges, casualtie, and chaunce, bryng
vpon vs, whych may happen euen to a
wyse man. But, if these thynges be
euel, who cā iustly affirme, that a wise
man is alwayes happye? since, euen in
all these, he may be at one instant.
               Wherfore, I wyll not gladly graunt,
neyther to bothe our maysters, nor yet
to those auncient philosophers, Aristotle,

Speusippus, Xenocrates, and Polemon:
that inasmuch as they count al
those thinges, which I haue afore rehersed
to be euel) thei may wel affirme
that a wyse man shoulde be alwayes
blessed. But, if this fayre, and glorious
sayeng doth delyght thē: being in deede
most worthy of Pithagoras, Socrates
and Plato: then, let them finde in their
heartes, to despyse those thinges, with
the whych they are nowe so muche delighted.
namely, strength, health, beautye,
ryches, honour, and substaunce.
               And to set at noughte those thinges,
whych are contrary to that which they

                     •
                  ayne they do desyre. Then maye they
playnly professe, that they are nothing
moued neyther wyth the force of fortune,
neyther with the opinion of the
people, neyther with gryefe nor pouertye.
But that all theyr ayde, consisteth
in theym selues: and that there is nothing
wythout theyr power, that they
esteeme to be good. For it can not be
by any meanes, that any should speake
these wordes whych belong, to a stout
and hie minded man: and yet shoulde

think those thinges to be good, or euel,
which the common people so counteth.
With the whych glory, Epicurus beinge
moued, firste rose vp who (if god
will) thinkes, that a wyse man may be
alwayes blessed. He is delyghted with
the worthines of this sayeng. But trulie,
he woulde neuer saye it, if he did
agree to his owne wordes. For, what
is there lesse agreable then, that, he,
whych thinketh griefe to be the greatest
euell, or els, that it onelye is euell,
that he (I saye) shoulde thinke, that a
wyse man euen in his tormētes should
saye? O howe pleasaunte is this? We
must not therfore, iudge philosophers,
by euery perticuler saieng: but by their
continuall, and constant asseueration,
in all their assertions.
            
            
               Hea.
               You moue
me somewhat to agree vnto you. But,
beware, lest you also may seme to lacke
a poynt of constancie.
            
            
               Mar.
               Why so?
            
            
               Hea.
               Because I did of late, read youre
booke, of the endes of good and euell.
In the whyche, me thoughte, that reasoninge
agaynste Cato, you assayed to
proue, this (which liked me very well)

I meane, that betwyxte Zeno, and the
Peripatetikes, there is no more difference,
thē the straungenes of certaine
termes. Whiche, if it be true, what
cause is there, whye, yf Zeno thinke,
that vertue is of it selfe sufficiente, to
leade an honest life, the Peripatetikes
also, do not thinke the same?
               For, I thinke, we oughte to haue regarde
to theyr meaninge, and not to
theyr wordes.
            
            
               Mar.
               You trulye, worke
strayghtly wtth me. For, you reporte,
whatsoeuer I haue sayd or wrytten.
               But I reason wyth other men, which
wel nie of necessity maintaine the opiniō
of any one sect, after this sort. We
liue but a shorte time, whatsoeuer seemeth
probable vnto vs, that we do affirme.
Wherfore, we onely, of al other
are free. But forasmuche as, I spake
somewhat afore of constanry, and stedfastenes:
I minde not in this place, to
dispute, whether it were true, that Zeno
liked best, and his folower Aristo: I
meane, that that onely is good, whych
is honeste: but, that, if it be so, then he

should place blessed and happy lyfe, in
onely vertue: wherfore, let vs graunte
to my frend Brutus, that according to
his opinion, a wise man shoulde be alwayes
happye. For, who is more worthy,
to haue the glorye of that sayenge,
then he? But yet, howe well it doth agree
wyth his owne opinion, let hym
selfe consider. But let vs holde that
a wise man is alwayes most happye.
               And although Zeno, a straunger born
in Citium, a towne of Cypres, an obscure
caruer of wordes, woulde gladly
creepe into the name of an aunciente
philosopher: Yet, the grauitie of this opinion,
ought fyrst to be deriued, from
the authority of Plato. In whom, this
is verye often repeated, that nothynge
ought to be called good, but onely vertue.
As in his booke, which he entituled
Gorgias, when one demaunded of
Socrates, whether he did not thinke,
that Archelaus (who thē was counted
most fortunate of all other) was happy
& blessed? He answered, y• he knew not.
For, he neuer talked with him, in all

his life. What? sayest thou so? canst
thou not knowe it otherwise? No trulye.
Doest thou doubte, then, whether
the myghtye kynge of the Persians be
happye, yea or no? Whye should I not
since I knowe not, howe learned he
is, or whether he be a good man, or no?
Whye? thynkest thou, that happy lyfe
consysteth therein? I truly thinke, that
all good men are happye: and that all
noughty men are wretched. Is Archelaus
then a wretche? Yea trulye, if he
be a vicious lyuer. Doth not this man
(thinke you) place happy lyfe in vertue
onely? He also, in his booke, whiche is
entituled Epitaphium, hath these wordes.
For that man (quod he) who wythin
him selfe, hath all thinges necessarye
for a happy life, and wauereth not, depending
vpon the good or euel chaunce
of anye other thinge, he hath euen gotten,
the trade of a perfect life. He is
a modest, stoute, and a wyse man. He,
although all other forrayne commodities,
eyther ryse or fall, will alwayes
obey the olde precept, & neyther reioyce

neyther sorowe ouer much, because, all
his hope is fixed onely in him selfe.
               Out of this holy and sacred sprynge of
Plato, shall flowe all our talke that foloweth.
From whence therefore maye
we better take our beginninge, then,
from nature: the common parent, and
authour of all thinges? Who, what so
euer she made, not onelye beinge a liuing
creature, but also, either any such
thing, as springeth out of the ground:
made it, euerye thinge, perfecte in his
owne kynde. And for that cause, both
trees & vines, & also the lowe floures,
whiche can not springe hie from the
ground, some of thē are alwaies grene
And some of them, being made bare in
the winter, yet reuiuing in the spring,
beginne to bud out agayne. For there
is none of theym, that is not so nouryshed,
eyther wyth some inwarde motion,
or els some power enclosed in it,
that it dothe not at certayne times of
the yeare, yelde eyther, floures, fruites
or beries. And all thinges, as much as
partayneth to theyr nature, are perfect
wythin them selues, vnlesse, they

be hurt by the iniury of some forrayne
force. But we may much more plainelye,
perceyue this power of nature in
beastes. Because, there are by nature,
senses geuen to theym. For some beastes
nature would to be swimmynge,
and abiding in the waters: whiche are
called fishes. To other some, she gaue
the open aer, to inhabite: which are called
birdes. Some she made crepers, &
some goers, and of theym all, some she
made solitarye: and some flockers together:
some wylde: some tame: some
hidden and couered with the ground.
And of all these, euery one folowynge
his dutye, and, being not able to turne
into the nature of any other liuing creature:
abydes still, within that lawe,
which nature hath appoynted it. And,
likeas, there is naturallye geuen to euery
beast, some especial property from
al the rest, which it doth alwayes kepe
and neuer parte from: so is there lyke
wyse to man. But it is much more excellent,
then the other. Howe be it, excellent,
is not properlye spoken, but of
th
                     •
                  se thinges, betwyxte the whiche,

there is some comparyson. But the
mynde of man, proceedinge fyrst, euen
from the spyryte of God, oughte to be
compared wyth no other thynge, then
God him selfe. It therefore, if it be
well garnished, and his sighte so cleared,
that it be not blynded with errours:
then it becomes a perfect mind,
which is, as much to saye, as absolute
reasō. Which is euē the same y• vertue
is. And if that be happy, which lacketh
nothing, but is perfect of it selfe in his
owne kinde, and that properlye belongeth
onelye to vertue: then nedes must
all suche as haue attayned vertue, be
happye. And herein, trulye both Brutus,
Aristoteles, Xenocrates, Speusippus,
and Polemon, do agree with me.
But I thinke further, that suche as
are partakers of vertue, are also moste
happye. For what doth he lacke to a
happye life, whyche trusteth on no other
goodes, thē his owne? Or he that
doth mistrust his goodes, howe can he
be happie? But he must nedes mistrust
them, who makes thre sortes of goods
For, howe can he assure him selfe, eyther

of the good estate of his bodye, or
els of any staye in fortune? But truly,
no man can be made happy wyth anye
good, vnlesse the same be stable and
sure. And what certayntye is there, of
any of those goodes? None at all. To
the whych, that mery sayenge of a citesin
of Lacedemon, may in my opinion
be wel applied. To whom, when a certayne
marchaunt man made his bragges,
that he had set forthe a great companye
of shippes, to sundrye realmes,
laden with marchaundise: nowe trulye
(quod he) I lyke not thys wealth, that
hangs all on gable endes. And is it
any doubte that those thynges whyche
maye be loste, are not of that sorte of
goodes whyche make a hapyye, and a
blessed life? For, none of those thynges
of the whyche such a lyfe doth consyst,
can eyther waxe aged, peryshe, or
moult and fall away. For he that standeth
in feare of the losse of anye suche
thynges, can not be happye. For we
wyll, that he, whom we counte happye,
shall be quyete, inuincible, and

troubled I saye, not with a litle feare,
but wyth none at all. For as he is called
innocent, which not onelye hurteth
no man lyghtlye, but also, hurteth no
man at all: so he is to be counted voyde
feare, not whyche feareth smallye, but
who feareth nothinge at all. For,
what is fortitude, otherwyse, then a
pacient affection of the minde, as well
in attempting perillous affayres, as
also in abidinge trauayle and griefe,
farre from all feare? And trulye, thys
were not so, vnlesse, all good did consist
in honestye onely. But howe might he
obtayne quietnes of minde (whyche
euery man so greatly wysheth and desyreth
(by quietnes, I meane the lacke
of all sorowe, in the whych happy lyfe
doth consist) who eyther presentlye had
or els myght haue, a great number of
euels fall on him? Also, howe maye he
be stoute, and hye minded, despysing al
chaunces, which may happen to man:
as trifles (as a wise man must) vnlesse
he think, that he nedeth no more helpe
then that which is within him selfe?
               The Lacedemonians, when kynge

Philip threatned them, that he would
barre al their enterprises: asked of him
whether he wold forbid thē also to die?
And shal we notsoner find out this one
man, whō we nowe treate of, of such a
stomacke, then a whole citie? Furthermore,
when to this stoutenes (of the
which we nowe talke) temperaunce is
once adioyned, whyche is the cooler of
all motions: What then may he lacke
of a blessed lyfe? whom fortitude shall
defend from gryefe, sorowe, and feare:
and temperance shal reuoke from gredy
desyre, and vayne mirth? And that
these thinges are wrought by vertue,
I would now proue, if I had not, more
largely shewed the same afore. And in
asmuche, as the perturbations, & troubles
of the minde, do make a wretched
life: and, contrarywise, the quietnes of
the same, causeth a happye life: And
there are two sortes of perturbations:
the one proceedinge out of the opinion
of euel, whych are sorowe, and feare:
the other caused of the opinion of good:
which are desyre and lyght mirth: inasmuche
as, all these striue with reason,

and councell, will you doubte to saye,
that he whyche is quyete, and rydde
from such troublous motions, repugnant
and contrarye the one to the other,
is blessed? But, a wyse man is alwayes
so. A wyse man therefore, is
alwayes blessed. Also, we oughte to reioyce,
of all thynge, that good is.
               But that, whych we ought to reioyce,
of, is worthy prayse: and, what so euer
is suche, it also is glorious. If it be glorious,
it is also commendable. But
whatsoeuer is commendable, the same
is honest also. Therfore, whatsoeuer
is good, the same is honest. But those
thinges, whych these men call goods,
they them selues trulye, will not saye
that they are honest. But that onelye
is good, whyche is honest. It foloweth
therfore, that in honestye onelye, consi
                  
                     •
                  teth
a happye lyfe. And those are neyther
to be counted, neither yet to be named
goodes: with the which, although
a man do abound, yet he may be moste
miserable. But who doubteth but a
man beynge in good healthe, perfecte
strength, seemely beautye, hauyng his

senses also as quicke and as cleare, a
                     •
                  
they myghte be. Adde thereunto, also,
swyftnes, and lyghtenes, let him haue
riches, honour, rule, wealth, and glorye:
if he, that hath all these thynges,
be an vnryghtuous man, a ryotter, a
fearefull person, or a man of slender
wyt, or none at all, wyll you doubte (I
saye) to call him wretched? Wherefore
what maner goodes be these, which he
that hath, neuerthelesse, may be wretched?
We must remember, that like as
a heape of corne, is made of a number
of graynes, of one sorte: so lykewyse
happye life doth consist of many partes
in nature, lyke to it selfe. Whych, if it
be so, then must we frame a happy life,
of those goodes onelye, whyche are honest.
For if there be a mixtion of vnlyke
and contrarye partes, then can
there be no honestye made thereof.
               Whych being taken awaye what can
there be happye? For whatsoeuer is
good, that oughte to be desyred. And
whatsoeuer ought to be desyred, ought
to be allowable. whatsoeuer oughte to

                     •
                  e allowed, the same oughte well and

fully to be accepted. And for that cause
it must be had in worshippe and reuerence
also. Whych, if it be so, thē must
it needes be laudable. All good therefore
is laudable. Whereof, I do conclude,
that whatsoeuer is honeste, the
same onely is good. Which assertion,
vnlesse we holde fast, we shall make an
infinite number of goodes. For, that I
ouerpasse ryches (whiche, inasmuch as
euery man (be he neuer so vnworthye)
may haue, I wil neuer coūt for goods.
For, that which is good, no noughtye
person may haue). That I maye ouerpasse
also, nobilitie, the brute of the
people, raysed by the consent of fooles,
and vicious persons. Yet these tryfles
whyche I will rehearse, will be
counted goodes. White teethe, rollyng
eyes, a beautiful complexion, and
that which Euriala praysed, when she
washed the feete of Ulires, namelye
gentle speache, and tender fleshe. And
these thinges, if we do once cal goods,
what more wyt shall there be accompted,
in the graue wysedome of philosophers,
then in the rashe brute of the

                  
                     •
                  ascall people? These thynges, whych
those men terme goodes, the Stoykes
call additions. Withoute the whyche,
they thinke a happy life can not be fullye
furnished. But these men thinke,
that wythout them, there is no happy
life at all. Or if it be happye, that it is
not the happiest life of all. But we wil
haue it, to be the happyest of all.
               And that we confyrme, by a conclusion
of Socrates. For in this sorte, that
prince and founder of philosophy, dyd
reason. Suche, as the affection of man
is, such is his talke. To his talke, his
deedes be like. To his deedes his lyfe.
But there is no affection in the minde
of a good man, but good and commendable.
Then it must needes be honest
also, if it be commendable. Whereof it
is necessarilye concluded, that all good
men leade a happye life. For, haue we
done nothing wyth our former disputations?
Haue we made a vayne speake
onely, for pleasure, and to spende the
time, when we reasoned, that a wyse
man was alwayes free from all motions
of the minde, whych I terme perturbations?

And, that there is alwaies
nothing, but quiete peace, within hys
heart? Therfore, a temperate, and constant
man, wythout any feare, wythout
any gryefe, wythout anye excessiue
mirth or desyre, is not he (I saye) happye?
But a wyse man is alwayes so.
               He is therfore alwayes happye. Furthermore,
howe can a good man do any
thing els, then referre al his deedes
and thoughtes, to that, whych is commendable?
But, he referres them al to
a happy life. A happie life then is commendable.
but nothing is commendable,
wythou
                     •
                  e vertue. A happye, and
a blessed life therefore, is attayned by
vertue. The same also, is concluded
after this sort. There is nothing praise
worthye, eyther in a miserable life, or
els, in suche, as is neyther miserable,
nor blessed. But there is some kinde of
life, in the whych there is some thinge
prayse worthy, and to be desyred. As
Epaminundas sayeth.
Our wittye counsels haue debased,
the Lacedemonians prayse.
               
               And Africanus sayeth.

                     
                     From farthest East, where sonne doth
ryse, vnto Meaotis marshe.
                     He liueth not whose feates my deedes
or famous factes may passe.
                  
               
               Whiche if it be so, then a happye lyfe
ought to be desyred. For there is nothinge
els, that ought to be praysed, or
desyred, Which being once concluded,
you knowe what foloweth. And truly,
vnlesse that lyfe be happy, which is also
honeste, there shoulde be somewhat
better then a blessed life. For if honestye,
and it, myght be separated: euerye
man would graunt, that honesty were
better. And so there shoulde be somethynge
better then a blessed life. Then
the whyche, what could be sayde more
fondly? Also, when they confesse, that
vice is sufficiente, to make vs leade a
miserable life: do they not then graunt
that vertue is of the lyke power, to
make a happye life? For of contraries,
the conclusions also are contrarye.
               And in this place, I woulde fayne
knowe, what Critolaus ment, by his
balance. Who, when into the one
scale, he had put the goods of the mind

and into the other, the goods of the bodye,
and of fortune, makes, that scale
of goods of the minde, so farre to wey
downe the other, as the heauen doth
the earth and seas. What lets hym
then, or Xenocrates, that moste graue
philosopher (who doth so much amplyfie
the power of vertue, and debase and
depsise al the rest) that he can not finde
in his hearte, to place the happyest lyfe
of all others, in onely vertue? Whych
truly, vnlesse it be so, there must nedes
ensue, the decaye of all vertues. For, to
whom sorowe maye come, to hym also
maye feare. For fearinge is a carefull
wayting for sorowe, that is comming.
And whosoeuer is subiecte to feare, he
must needes be combred also with all
the mates of the same: fearefulnes,
dreade, and quakynge. And for that
cause, he must not thinke him selfe inuincible,
neyther that, that sayenge of
Atreus was spoken to him.
               Let no man in this wretched lyfe,
him selfe so ill behaue,
               That vnto fortunes cruell stroke
he shewe him selfe a slaue.
               
                  
But suche a man, will strayght ways
be ouercome: and not onely be vanquished,
but become euen a slaue. And we
will haue vertue alwayes free and inuincible.
For otherwyse it is no vertue.
But if there be sufficient helpe, in
vertue it selfe to liue well: there shalbe
sufficient also, to liue blessedlye. For
truly, vertue, is able enough, of it selfe
to make vs liue stoutelye. If it be able
enough, of it selfe, thereto, it is able also,
to make vs to be of a stout courage.
So that, we shal neither be feared, neither
yet ouercome, of any other thing.
And thereof, it must nedes folow, that
nothing maye make vs to repent: that
we may lacke nothynge: nor nothinge
can withstand vs. So we shal haue all
thinges abundantlye, fullye, and prosperouslye.
And for that cause, blessedly
also. Furthermore, vertue, is able enoughe,
to make vs liue stoutelye, and
for that cause happely also. For, as follye,
althoughe it hathe obtayned that,
whiche it did desyre, yet neuerthelesse,
neuer thinkes it selfe satisfied: so wisedome
contraryewyse, is alwayes contented

wyth that whyche it hath, and
neuer repenteth her owne estate.
               Thinke you, that it was not al one, to
Caius Lelius, to be once chosen consull,
and another time to take a repulse?
Althoughe, when a wyse, and a
good man (as he was) lacketh voyces:
the people, ought rather to be deemed,
to haue the repulse from a good Consull,
then that he hath anye repulse, of
the vayne multitude. But whether
would you (if you might choose) be consull
once, as Lelius was, or foure tymes,
as Cinna? I do litle doubte what
you will aunswere. For I knowe to
whom I speake. I would not so boldly
aske the same, of some other. For, I
knowe, that some there be, that would
aunswere me, that thei would preferre
not onely the foure Consulshippes, of
Cinna, but euen one day of his raigne
afore the liues of many notable men.
But Cinna, commaunded the heades
of his felowe consul Caius Octauius,
of Publius Crassus, and Lucius Cesar,
thre most notable mē (whose wits
had bene well proued, as well in time

of warre, as peace) of Marcus Antonius
also, the moost eloquente Oratour,
that euer I heard: and of Caius Cesar
(in whom, in my opinion, was the perfection
of all gentlenes, pleasauntnes,
and mirth) to be stryken of. Is he then
happye, which put these men to death?
Truly, in my opinion, he is not onely
wretched, for that he caused that to be
done: but also, because he behaued him
selfe so, that he myght do it. Although,
no man maye lawefully sinne. But I
erre, vsing y• wonted maner of speach.
For, we saye commonlye, that a man
may do that, whyche he hath power to
do. Yet whether was Caius Marius
more happye, then, when he communicated
the glory of his victory, which
he obtayned agaynst the Cymbrians,
wyth his felowe in office Catulus, in
wysedome an other Lelius: (for in my
opinion, they maye well be compared)
or els, when he, being conqueroure in
the ciuile battayle, angrye with the
frendes of the same Catulus, whyche
entreated for him, would geue theym
no other word, but let him dye: let him

dye. Nowe truly, more happy was he,
that obeyed that blouddy commaundement,
then he, that commaunded it.
               For, bothe it is farre better, to suffer,
then to do iniury: and also, willynglye
to meete death, when it approcheth (as
Catulus did) it was farre better done,
then as Marius did: by the death of so
worthy a man, to stayne the glorye of
his sixe firste consulshippes: and with
bloudshed, to defile the last time of his
age. Eyght and thirtye yeares, Dionisius
was tyrant of Siracusa, comynge
to the kingdome, at .xxv. yeares of age.
That beautifull citie, of so notable
wealth, howe did he kepe in bondage?
And of this man, we reade thus much
written in historyes. That he vsed a
merueylous temperate dyet, and that
in all his deedes, he proued him selfe a
maruaylous wittye, & a paineful man.
And yet neuerthelesse, he was of a
mischieuous cruell nature. Wherefore
to all such, as do well weygh his case,
he must nedes seeme to be wretched.
               For, that, which he so much desired, he
could not then attaine, whē he thought

he might haue done, what he lysted.
               Who, hauinge good and honeste parentes,
and beinge come of an honest
stocke, (howebeit thereof diuers men
diuersly do write) hauing also great acquayntaunce,
and familiaritie wyth
princes, and also certayne yong boyes,
according to the maner of Greece, appoynted
for his loue & playe: yet, durst,
to trust none of them all. But committed
the custody of his bodye, to certaine
slaues, whom he him selfe had made
free: to hyred seruauntes, and to cruell
Barbarians. So, onely, for the desyre
he had, to beare rule: he had in maner,
shut vp him selfe, into a pryson. Also,
because he would not trust any barber
to shaue him, he caused his owne
doughters to learne to shaue. So the
maydens of honoure, when they had
learned, that filthy and slauishe science
as barbers, shaued the beard, & heares
of theyr father. And yet neuerthelesse,
theym also, when they came to yeares
of discrescretion, he would not truste,
wyth a raser: but, commaunded that
with the shales of walnuttes heated,

they should burne of his beard, and his
heares. And although he had two wiues,
Aristomache borne in the same
citye, and Doris, borne in the citye of
Locris: yet, he would neuer come to any
of them, in the night, afore that, all
places were searched, for feare of treason.
And then, would he haue an artificiall
trench aboue his bed, whych had
but one way, to passe ouer, which was
by a draw bridge. Which he him selfe
when the chamber dore was locked,
would draw to him. And furthermore
daringe not, to come to any place of resorte,
he would talke to his subiectes,
downe from a hye tower. On a certayne
time, when he woulde playe at
tenesse (for that game he vsed verye
much) it is sayde, that he deliuered to a
yonge man whom he loued very well
his sworde to kepe. which when one of
his familiar frendes, espyenge, sayd in

                     •
                  este: to him nowe you truste your life:
and, the yong man smyled at it: he commaunded
them both to be slayne. The
one, because he had shewed the waye
howe he might be slaine: the other, for

that he seemed in smilinge, to allowe
the same. But, that deede afterwardes
so much repented him, that nothing in
all his life, greued him more. For, he
had caused him to be put to death, whō
he loued entierly. But this tirant, seemeth
him selfe, to haue shewed, howe
happye he was in deede. For, when on
a time, Damocles, one of his flatterers,
did recken vp his power, myght,
maiestie, and rule: his greate aboundaunce
of all thinges, and his magnificence
in building, sayenge, that there
was no man at any time, more happye
then he: wylt thou then, O Damocles,
(quod he) because this life doth so much
delight the, thy selfe taste thereof? and,
try the pleasure, of my happy chaunce?
Whereunto, when he aunswered that
he would very gladly: Dionisius, commaunded
him, to be layde in a bedde of
gold, hauing a couerlet of cloth of gold
and hanginges of beatē gold: wrought
with verye fayre workes. Also he set
coupbordes, and chestes afore him, full
of plate, bothe of golde, and also of sil
                  
                     •
                  er
gylt. Then he commaunded, cer
                  
                     •
                  ayne

boyes of notable beautye, to attend
on his person, and to be readye at
his becke. There were brought in precious
oyntmentes, imperiall crownes
the perfumes burnt in euery place, and
the tables were spredde, wyth the most

                     •
                  ayntye dishes that mighte be gotten.
Then, seemed Damocles to be happy.
But, in the middes of all this iolitye
Dionisius commaunded a glisterynge
sword, to be hanged ouer his head, by a
horse heare. So that it mighte well
nye touche his necke. Wherewyth,
Damocles being feared, could neyther
fynde in his hearte, to looke vpon hys
fayre boyes, neyther yet vpon the grauen
gold, neyther would he reache his
hand to the table, to taste of any thyng
that was thereon. The crownes fell
downe from his head. To be shorte, he
desyred the tyrant to lycence him to depart.
Sayeng, that he would no longer
be happye. Dyd not he (thynke you) declare
sufficientlye, that he can haue no
happynesse, ouer whom there hangeth
any feare? Yet neuerthelesse, he trulye
was not able to retourne to iustice.
               
                  
Neyther to restore to his citesens they
                     •
                  
libertye and lawes. For, he was euen
from his youth vpwarde bred in tirannye.
So that, though he would haue repented,
yet he could not haue lyued in
safety. Yet how much he desyred frendshippe
(the vnfaithfulnes of the which,
he did much mistrust) he did wel shewe
in those two Pithagoreans. The one
of the whyche, when he was taken for
suretye, that the other should retourne
at a certayne daye to suffer death: and,
the other came in deede, at the day appoynted:
I would to god (quod he) that
I were worthy to be your thyrd frend.
What a miserye was it, for him to
want the companye of his frendes, all
societye of life, and all familiar talke?
being especiallye, a man very wel learned,
a
                     •
                   one, from his childehoode vpwardes,
stil bred vp in learning? We
haue heard also, that he loued musicians
very wel, and, that he was a good
poete, in compiling of tragedies.
               But, howe good he was therein, it
is nothynge to oure purpose to talke
of. For in this kynde of studye, inespceiallye,

more then in all the reste,
euerye man likes his owne doinges
best. For I neuer thitherto knewe
anye Poete (yet I was verye well acquaynted,
both wyth Aquinius, and
also wyth manye other) who did not
thinke, his owne doynges better, then
all the others. So it is alwaye. Your
doinges like you best, and mine, me.
               But to retourne to Dionisius. He lyued
wythoute anye gentlenes, or maners,
as it becomes a man. He lyued
with caytifes, cutthrotes, and barbarians.
He thoughte no man to be his
frende, that eyther was worthye to be
free, or would be free. I wil not nowe,
wyth this mans life (then the whyche
there coulde be nothinge more miserable,
beastlye, or detestable) compare the
liues of Plato, or Architas, famous
learned, and wyse men. But I wyll
rayse vp from the duste and dungehill,
Archimedes a poore, and an obscure
person
                     •
                  borne in the same citie, who liued
many yeares after. Whose tombe,
when I was Questor, I founde out at
Siracusa, all beset and ouergrowen

wyth bushes and thornes. Whereas,
the men of the citie told me, that there
was no such thinge. For I remembred
certayne verses, whiche I hearde saye,
were written vpon his tombe. Which
did declare, that vpon his graue, there
was a spheare, and a Cilindre. But I,
after I had diligently vewed on euery
syde, (for there is at the gates called Agragians,
a great company of graues)
I espied at last, a litle piller, somewhat
higher then the bushes, in the whyche
there was the forme of a Spheare, and
of a Cilindre. Then, I tolde the worshipfull
of the citie, whyche were there
with me, that I thoughte, that same
was it, which I l
                     •
                  oked for. Thē, forthwith,
certayne labourers, set in wyth
scyues, and cutting hookes, opened the
place. Into the which, when we came,
at the farther part of the bottome, ther
appeared an Epigramme, wyth the
later part of certayn verses, some who
lye worne away, & some, halfe remayning,
and halfe worne. So, one of the
noblest cities in all Greece, yea, and in
time paste one of the best learned, had

not knowen the tombe of this theyr
most famous citesin, vnlesse, they had
learned it, of a man borne at Arpinas.
But I will retourne thither, from
whence I firste came. What man is
there, who hath anye familiaritie, not
wyth the muses onely, but eyther with
any part of honestie, or learninge, that
woulde not wishe him selfe, rather to
be this Mathematician, then that tyran?
If we desyre to knowe the maner
and trade of bothe their liues. The
minde of the one, liued in the searching
and conferring of reasons wyth the delyght
of knoweledge: which is the swetest
foode, that our soules may haue.
               But, the minde of the other, was nourished
wyth slaughter, and iniury, and
beset wyth continuall feare. But now
brynge in Democritus, Pithagoras,
and Anaragoras. What kyngedome,
or what riches, would you preferre afore
theyr studies and delyghtes? For
trulye, that, whyche we nowe seeke:
namely, the most happy and blessed life
of all others: muste needes be in that
part, whyche is best in all the man.
               
                  
But what is there in anye man, better,
then a wyse and a good minde?
               That therfore, whiche is the chyefe
good of the minde, we muste studye to
attayne, if we will be happye. But the
chiefe good of the minde, is vertue.
               Wherfore, it must needes folowe, y• in
it is contayned a happy life. And hereof
issue all those thinges, which we cal
beautifull, honest, and fayre. But we
must speake this same more at large.
               For all these thinges are full of ioye.
               But of continuall and perfect ioye, it
is euident, that a happye life doth proceede.
Wherfore it must needes consist
of honestye. But, let vs not onelye in
wordes, moue the same, which we wil
proue: but also, propose some certayne
ymage of the same, whyche may nowe
moue vs the more, to the knoweledge,
and vnderstandinge of these thynges,
For let vs propose some notable man,
endued with most excellent qualities,
and imagine and conceyue him, onelye
in our minde. Firste, he must needes
haue a notable witte. For dul heades,
do not so easely attayn vertue, as those

whyche are quicke witted. Then, he
must needes haue a very earnest zeale,
and desire, to searche out the truth.
               Whereof, rise those three properties,
of the mind. The one, consisting in the
knoweledge of thinges, and description
of nature: the other, in the descrybing
of those thinges, that ought to be
desyred or auoyded: and the thirde, in
iudging, what doth necessarily folowe
of anye thinge, or what is contrarye to
the same. In the whyche, is contayned
both all the sutteltye of reasoning, and
also the truthe of iudgementes. What

                     •
                  oye, then, must the minde of this wise
man needes dwell in, daye and nyght,
with such pleasaunt thoughtes? when
he shall also beholde the motions and
turninges of the whole worlde: and
shall see innumerable starres fastened
in the skyes, and turned, onelye by the
motion of the same. And other some, to
hau
                     •
                   motiōs, & courses of theyr owne,
distante the one from the other, eyther
in hyghnes or lowenes. Whose wanderinge
motions, kepe neuerthelesse, a
stedfast and certayne course. Trulye,

the syghte of those, moued and learned
those auncient philosophers, to searche
further. Thereof came the firste searchinge
oute of principles, as it were of
seedes, and the enquiring, whereof all
thinges, had theyr beginninge and beinge.
As well thinges liuing, as wythout
lyfe. As wel dumme, as speaking.
Also, howe they lyued, and by what natural
cause they came to death and corruption.
Also, howe one thing is chaunged
and tourned to another. Howe the
earth had fyrst his beginning. Howe it
was so paysed, in the middest of the
world. Also, into what vautes, it doth
receyue, the flowing and ebbing of the
seas. And howe that all heauy thinges
naturally fall into it, as into the middell
place of the world. Which is, alwayes
the lowest, in anye rounde bodye.
About these thinges, whiles the
minde is busyed nyghte and daye, he
must needes also some times remember,
that precepte, whyche the God of
Delphos gaue. Namely, that it knowe
it selfe free from all vyce, and vnderstande,
that it is parte of the nature of

god. Whereby, it is filled with insatiable
ioy. For, the very thinking, of the
power, & nature of the gods, enflames
our heartes, to folowe that eternitye,
and not to despayre for the shortnes of
lyfe. Inasmuch as, we see the causes of
all thinges, to be necessarilye knyt one
to an other. Which euen from the beginning,
cotinuing til the end, yet the
mind, & reason, of men may well comprehend,
and rule. These thinges, he
beholding, and maruaylinge at, wyth
what quietnes of minde must he nedes
consider, both all earthly thinges, and
also all other aboue the same? Hereof
riseth the knoweledge of vertue. And
hereof springe out all the sondry sortes
and braunches of the same. Hereby we
fynde out, what is the best of al goods,
and what is the vttermost, and extreemest
of all euels. Also, to what end we
ought to referre all our dutyes, in this
life. An
                     •
                   what trade we ought to chose
to passe our life in. Which, with suche
other like thinges, beinge once founde
out, then is that brought to passe, whiche
in this reasoning we seke to proue.

Namely, that vertue is of it selfe onely
sufficient, to make a man leade a blessed
life. There foloweth nowe the
third kynd, whych spreadeth and is deriued,
through out al the parts of wisedome.
Which defyneth euery thynge:
deuideth it into sondry partes: ioyneth
thereunto such thinges, as may folow
of it: concludes thinges perfectlye, and
iudgeth them to be eyther true or false.
I meane, the trade and oder of reasoninge.
Of the which, there ryseth, both
great profite, in the weyging of ouerye
question, and also very great delyghte,
and euen worthy of a wyse man. But
all these thinges, pertayne to tyme of
leasure: let the same wise man, come
to the gouerninge of a common welth.
Who can do it better then he? inasmuch
as, he shall see, that in his prudence
and polecye, the profyte of al the
citesens doth consiste. And iustice will
not suffer him, to deriue anye thynge,
that ought to be common, to his owne
pryuate commdditye. And so, in lykewyse,
he shall haue the helpe of all the
other vertues. Ioyne thereto the fruite

of frendshippe, in the whiche, all learned
men, do place both the vniuersall
and frendlye consent, for the maynteyninge
of our common life: and also, a
great ioy and pleasure, in the common
societie, and vse of neyghbourhood.
               What (I pray you) may such a life lack
to make it more happy? To the which,
beynge furnished and accomplished,
wyth so greate ioyes, euen fortune it
selfe, must needes yelde. Trulye, if to
reioyce, for the obtaining of such goods
and commodities of the minde, be to
be blessed: and all wyse men do feele
such pleasure, then must you nedes confesse,
that all suche are happye.
            
            
               Hea.
               What? in thyyr payne and tormentes
also.
            
            
               Mar.
               Why, do you thinke, that
I meane, y• they are happy in some pleasaunt
garden. Or in a 
                     •
                  ed of violets,
or roses? Shall it be lawefull for Epicurus
(who is a philosopher onelye, to
the face outwardes; and gaue him selfe
that name) to saye (whych sayenge neuerthelesse,
I woulde not gladlye take
from him) that there is no tyme, in the
whych a wyse man, although he were

burned, racked, or cut in pieces, would
not say, howe litle do I esteme al this?
Whereas he him selfe thinketh, that
all euel consisteth in paine: and al good
in pleasure. And iesteth at those thinges,
whiche we call honest and dyshonest.
Sayenge, that we are occupyed
onely in vaine wordes, and care for no
thinge, but onely the gentle or sharpe
sufferinge of the bodie. He therefore,
whose iudgement doth not muche differ,
from the iudgemente of brute beastes:
may lawefully forget him selfe.
               And so, despyse fortune. Whereas all,
his good and euell, doth consiste, onely
in the power of fortune. He may think
him selfe happy in payne and tormentes,
whereas he not onelye thinketh,
that pain is the greatest euel that may
be, but also, that it onely is euell. Neyther
yet hath he gotten these remedies
agaynst the suffering of griefe. Namely
the stoutenes of stomacke, shame of
dishonesty, exercise, and custome of sufferynge
the preceptes of fortitude, and
manly stoutenes. But he, sayeth, he is
contented onely with the remēbraunce

of his former pleasures. As if, a man
well nye parched wyth heate, so that,
he is no longer able to abide the sonne
should comfort him selfe, with the remembraunce,
that once heretofore, he
had bathed him selfe in the colde ryuers
of Arpynas. For truly, I see not,
howe the pleasures that are past, may
ease the gryeues that are present. But
inasmuche as he (I saye) sayeth, that a
wyse man is alwayes happye, who, if
he woulde be agreeable to him selfe,
might worst of al other speake it: what
shall they do whyche thinke, that nothinge
ought to be desyred, or counted
good whyche wanteth honesty? Truly
in my opinion, let the Peripatetikes,
yea, & the auncient Academikes, ceasse
any longer to doubte: and playnely say
that happye life, maye come euen into
the bull of Phalaris. For let there be
foure sortes of goodes that we maye
nowe departe from the brakes of the
Stoykes, whiche I vnderstande nowe
that I haue vsed more then I would.
               Let there be therfore (I say) thre sortes
of goodes, so that the goodes of the bodye,

and of fortune, maye lye on the
ground: and be counted goodes, onely,
because they are not to be refused. But
the other, which are in maner heauenlye,
may in comparison of them, reache
vnto the heauens. So that we neede
not doubt, to call him, which hath once
attayned them, not onelye happy, but
euen the happyest that may be. Nowe,
shall a wyse man feare gryefe?
               Whereas he is most contrarye to this
opinion. For agaynst the feare of oure
owne deathe, and the sorowe that we
might take for the death of our frendes
we seeme to be sufficientlye armed and
prepared by the former dayes disputations.
But, payne seemeth, to be the
sharpest aduersarye of vertue. It shaketh
his brandes at vs, it threateneth,
that she will weaken fortitude, stoutenes
of minde, and patience. To it, shal
vertue geue place? Or the happye lyfe
of a wyse and constant man yelde? O
god, what a shame were that? The
boyes of Sparta, do not so muche as
syghe, when theyr skin are euen torne
wyth stripes. My selfe, sawe whols

companies of yonge men, in Lacedemon,
striuinge one agaynste an other,
wyth theyr fystes, heeles, nayles, and
teeth. So long, that they would be euē
out of breath, and almoste ouercome,
afore they would confesse theym selues
to be beaten. What parte of Barbary,
is there, more wylde or rude, 
                     •
                  then India?
Yet neuerthelesse, emonges theim
those whyche are counted wyse men,
are fyrst bred vp, bare and naked. And
yet suffer both the colde of the hil Caucasus,
and also, the sharpenes of the
winter, without any paine. And when
they come to the fyer, they are able to
abide the heate, well nie, till they rost.
But the women there, when anye of
theyr husbandes dieth, are wont to fal
in contention, whyche of them (for they
haue many wyues) he loued best in his
life. She that winneth, beynge verye
ioyfull (a great company of her frendes
and kinsfolke, folowing her) is cast into
the fyer, wyth her dead husbande.
               Trulye, custome would neuer ouercome
nature. For it is of it selfe inuincible.
But we, with want
                     •
                  nnes, pleasure

ydlenes, and slouth, do first infect
our mindes. And afterwardes effeminating
it, with peruerse opinions, and
euell custome, we cause it euen wholye
to degenerate. Who is ignoraunt, of
the errour of the Egiptians? who perswaded
with a foolishe opinion, would
rather abide anye tormente, then they
woulde hurte the beast called Ibis, or
the serpent called Aspis, or a Cat, or a
Dogge, or a Crocodyle. But, if they
chaunce, to hurt any of them vnwares
they wil refuse no punishemēte for the
same. Hitherto I haue spoken of men.
But what shall I saye of beastes? Do
not they suffer cold and hunger? runne
both vp hill and downe hill, when they
be coursed? Do not they fyghte so for
theyr whelpes, that they are oft wounded,
fearing no blowes nor strokes? I
ouerpasse here, what paynes ambitious
men take, to obtayne honour. And
vaine glorious men, to get that, which
they thinke to be glory. Or such as are
enflamed wyth loue, to accomplyshe
theyr desyre. Our life is full of examples.
But I will measure my talke,

and retourne thither from whence I
first strayed. Happye life (I saye) will
offer it selfe into tormentes. And wyll
not, inasmuch as it hath alwaies afore
folowed iustice, temperance, fortitude,
stoutenes of stomake, and patience: as
soone as it shall see the face of the tormentoure,
then turne backe and slip awaye.
And inasmuch as al the vertues
wythout any feare, shall hasarde them
selues, in the payne of tormente: she
onely, shall not stand wythout the dore
and entry of the prison. For what may
be more filthy or ill fauoured, then happye
lyfe, when it is destitute, and separated
from the fayre traine of vertues?
Which neuerthelesse, can by no meanes
be. For, neyther can a man haue
all the vertues, without a happye lyfe:
neyther yet may there be a happy lyfe,
wythout vertue. And for that cause
they will not suffer it to tary behinde.
But wil alwayes, take her with them
to what so euer griefe, or torment they
shall go. For, it is the poynct of a wyse
man, to do nothiuge that may repente
him, nor anye thinge agaynst his will.

But, to do al things comely, constantlye,
grauelye, and honestlye. To looke
for nothinge, as thoughe it were certayne.
And also to thynke nothynge
straunge, or vnaccustomed, when it is
happened. To referre all thinges to
his owne discrecion, and stande to hys
owne iudgement. Then the which truly.
I can see nothing that may be moe
happye. The Stoykes, conclude this
question lyghtlye. Sayenge, that inasmuch
as, the chiefe ende of all good, is
to agree vnto nature: and to lyue accordyng
vnto her preceptes: and, it, is in
the power of a wyse man. It must needes
folowe, that in whose power it is,
to attayne the chiefest good, in his power
also it lyeth, to leade a quyete life.
So, euery wise man, doth leade a blessed
life. Thus you haue that, whyche
I thynke to be moost stoutelye spoken,
of a blessed and happy life. And (as the
case standeth) vnlesse you can bryng any
proofe, that also, which is as trulye
spoken, as it may be.
            
            
               Hea.
               Trulye,
I haue nothing better to saye. But I

would gladlye entreate you, if it were
not troublesome vnto you, because you
are not bound to any one feet, but onely,
borowe of euerye one, that whyche
seemeth to you to be moste true. For
that somewhat afore, you seemed to exhort
the Peripatetikes, and the auncient
Academikes, that wythoute anye
feare, they would boldelye saye, that a
wise man is alwayes most happy: that
(I saye) I woulde gladlye heare, howe
you could make agreable, to theyr opinion.
For you haue spoken very muche
against this opinion. Yea, and concluded
it with the reason of the Stoykes.
            
            
               Mar.
               Let vs then vse our liberty. The
fruition of the which, we chiefely of al
other philosophers do feele. Whose
talke iudgeth nothinge, but is applyed
agaynst all opiniōs. That it may, by it
selfe, wythout any other authoritye be
iudged. And that the gladlyer, because
you seme to be well pleased, that what
soeuer of the same sondry sortes of opinions
be true, yet vertue should be sufficient
to make vs leade a happy lyfe.
               (whych also Carneades was wonte to

dispute, and that very sharply, against
the Stoykes, whom he did alwayes
gladly reproue, and agaynst whose doctrine,
his minde was in maner enflamed.
But we wil do the same quietly.
For, if the Stoikes, haue well appointed
the endes of good and euel: then, is
the matter dispatched. For then must
a wyse man nedes be happye. But let
vs examine, the opinions of all the rest
that, this, so notable a decree, of a blessed
and happy lyfe, may be confyrmed,
wyth all theyr verdites. The opinions
which yet continue, and are openly defended,
as cōcerning the endes of good
and euell (as farre as I knowe) are
these. Firste, foure generall, or simple
opinions. Namely, that nothinge is
good, but that whych is honest. As the
Stoykes say. Or that nothing is good
but pleasure. As Epicurus affyrmeth.
Or that nothinge is good, excepte the
lacke of payne. As Hierome thinketh.
Or that nothing is good, but to enioye
and encrease those most excellente and
principall goodes, whych are geuen vs
of nature. These are the generall, or

simple opinions. But the mixt or compound
are these. Fyrst the three sortes
of goodes. The chiefest of the minde,
the next of the body: and the last of fortune.
As the Peripatetikes saye. Neyther
do the aūcient Academikes, much
dyffer from them. But Clitomachus,
and Calipho, ioyned pleasure with honestye:
and Diodorus the Peripatetike
ioyned the want of gryefe, with honestye.
These are all the opinions, which
haue any certayntie in them. For, the
opinions of Aristo, Pirrho, Herillus,
and manye others: are euen worne away.
What would folowe of all these
opinions, ouerpassinge the Stoykes,
(whose authoritye, we haue alreadye
sufficiently defended) and the Peripatetikes
(whose cause is alreadye debated:
exceptinge Theophrastus, who
wyth his folowers, feared griefe more
then he neded) let vs nowe se. For trulye,
as for all thother, they maye do (as
they commonly are wont) namelye, to
amplifye the grauitye, and dignitye of
vertue, which, when they haue extolde
euen to the skyes, (as eloquente men

should) in all the rest of theyr talke they
treade it vnder feete, and despyse it.
               But they, which think, that we ought
euen with gryefe, to labour for praise:
must not they nedes confesse, that they
are happye which haue attayned it?
               For although they be in some euel, yet
this name of a blessed, and happye lyfe
extendeth farre. For, like as tillage, is
counted a gaynefull, & profytable trade
although some yeare, tempest or some
other chaunce doth let the successe: yet
it is counted profitable, because it is so
most commonlye. Euen so our lyfe not
onely if it be replenished with al goods
but also, if it haue more goodes, then
euels, is to be counted happy. Wherefore,
by theyr owne reason, happy life,
must needes accompanye vertue, euen
to punishement. And shall go with her
into tormentes. Yea, Aristotle, Xenocrates,
Speusippus, & Polemon, wytnessing
the same. And shall neuer forsake
it, at the entysemēt of a fewe flattering
pleasures. To the same ende,
shall come the opinions of Caliphon,
and Diodorus: both the which, so embrace

honesty, that they thinke, that al
such thinges as are wythout the same,
ought vtterly to be despysed, and set at
nought. The other philosophers sticke
more. And with more payne, swimme
oute of the myer. I meane Epicurus,
and Hieronimus, & all the rest, whiche
a say to defend, the eloquent Carneades.
For there is none of them, whiche
thinketh that the minde oughte to be
the iudge of all goods: or that doth accustome
the same, to despise those thinges,
whych onely haue the apparaunce
eyther of good or euell. For what soeuer
thou thinke O Epicure, the same
wil both Hieronimus, and Carneades
and also all the rest saye. Yet, who of
them is there, not sufficiently prouided
agaynst death or gryefe? Let vs begin
of him (if you please) whom we call so
wanton and full of pleasure. Doth not
he (thinke you) despyse death and paine
who counteth that daye, in the whyche
he shall dye, happy and blessed? And
thinketh, that suche as are in the greatest
panges of payne, may comfort thē
selues, with the remembraunce of pleasures

past? Neyther yet doth he speake
that, as if he did rashely blabbe it out.
For his reason why death oughte not
to be feared is this. Because when the
life is gone, al sense is past. And, when
we are once withoute sence or feelinge:
there is no maner chaunce, that
maye greue vs. Also, he hath certayne
remedies for griefe. For, if it be greate
he comforteth him selfe with the shortnes
of the time, that it shall endure.
               And if it be long, then he thinketh that
space of time wil make it waxe lyghter
and lyghter. I praye you, in what better
case, are al the graue philosophers,
against these two most dreadful 
                     •
                  uels,
then Epicurus? Also, agaynst all the other,
which are counted euels: are not
Epicurus, and all the other philosophers
sufficiētly armed? Who is there
that doth not feare pouertye? And yet
what philosopher is there? yea or Epicurus
him selfe, wyth howe litle is he
content? No man hath spoken, or written,
more of a spare, and bare life. For
inasmuch as, he doth so muche au
                     •
                  yde
all those thinges, which necessarily requyre

money. Namely, loue, ambition
and such like. What
                     •
                   cause might ther
be, why he should eyther desyre, or care
for money? Coulde Anacharses a Scithian
despyse money, and shall not our
philosophers be able to do the same?
               There is an epistle of his writē in this
maner. Anacharses to Hanno sendeth
greeting. My clothing is a beastes skin

                     •
                  f Scithia. My shoes, are the harde
brawne in the sooles of my feete. My
bed is the ground. My sauce is honger.
My meate is milke, butter, and fleshe.
Wherefore you may wel come quietly
vnto me. But as for those gyftes, with
the which, you thinke you should pleasure
me, I pray you geue theym eyther
to your owne citesins, or els to the immortall
gods. Truly, all philosophers,
of whatsoeuer secte they were, vnlesse
they be suche, as a vicious nature hath
turned from the rule of reason, maye
well be of the same minde. Socrates,
when there was a great plenty of gold
and siluer brought vnto him, now lord
(quod he) howe litle do I passe for such
store? Xenocrates, when the messengers

whych came to him from Alexander,
had brought him twenty talentes
(whiche was counted at that tyme, at
Athenes inespeciallye, a great summe
of money) he brought the ambassadors
into that place, where Plato once kept
his scoole, and there made them a supper,
onely of so muche, as was sufficient,
without any great cost. And when
they asked him on the morowe, to whō
he would haue theym tell the money,
Why (quod he) did you not vnderstand
by the supper, I made you ye laste night
that I lacke no money? But when he
sawe them very sadde at that sayenge,
he toke thirty poundes, least he should
seeme to despise, the kinges liberalitie.
But Diogenes, whē Alexander asked
what he lacked, aunswered more like a
currishe philosopher. Sayenge, stande
out of the sonne. For he stoode betwixt
the sonne and him. And he was wonte
to dispute, how much he did surmount
the king of Persia, in a happy lyfe, and
good lucke. Sayeng, that he lacked nothing,
and the other would neuer hau
                     •
                  
enough. And that he desyred not pleasures

wyth the which, the other could
not be satisfyed. And yt those pleasures,
which he felt, the other might neuer attayne.
You remember (I thinke) howe
Epicurus deriued the sondry sortes of
desyres: although not ouer suttelly, yet
commodiously enough. Sayenge, that
they are partly naturall and necessary:
and partly, neyther naturall nor necessary.
And that suche as are necessary,
may be contented, and suffised, wel nie
with nothing. For, sufficiēt for nature
may lightly be gotten. But the seconde
sort, he thinkes it neyther harde to obtayne,
neyther yet to lacke. And the
thrd, because they were vtterly vaine
and fonde, and were requisite, neyther
for necessity, nor nature: he said ought
vtterlye to be rooted out. Hereabout,
the folowers of Epicurus reasō much,
and do debase, and despise in their talk
these pleasures, very much. Which neuerthelesse,
they do not despyse, but
seeke to haue plentye of. For, both they
saye, that filthy pleasures, of the which
they haue great talke, are easy, cōmon
and ri
                     •
                  e to be gottē: and also, if nature

do require thē, they thinke they oughte
to be measured, by beautye, age, and
hansomnes. And that it is nothinge
harde to abstayne from them, if eyther
our health, duty, or fame, do so require
                     •
                  
And that this kind of pleasure, is then
best, when it hurteth not. For it neuer
profyteth. And all these preceptes of
pleasures, he gaue, to y• ende, he would
shewe, that pleasure, for it selfe onely,
because it is pleasure, is to be wyshed
and desyred. And contrarywise, that
payne onely, because it is payne, ought
to be hated and auoyded. And this moderatiō,
he thinketh a wise man ought
to vse. Namelye, to flye pleasure, if he
think that it wil bring a greater paine
And to suffer payne, if he thinke, it wil
cause a greater pleasure. And that all
pleasure, although it be iudged by the
senses of the bodye: yet neuerthelesse,

                     •
                  ught to be referred to the minde. And
that for that cause, the bodye doth reioyce,
onelye so longe, as it doth feele
the pleasure present. But the mind, do
both ioye with the bodye, and also whē
                  
                     •
                  t fores
                     •
                  es, anye pleasure comming: or

remembreth, that which is paste. So
that, a wyse man, must needes haue a
continual and an euerlasting pleasure
Inasmuche as, to the hope of suche as
are comming, he did ioyne also, the remembraunce
of such as are past. Such
like also, is theyr talke, as concerninge
moderation of fare. They disprayse all
magnificence, and cost in bankets.
               Sayeng, that nature is cōtented with
a litle. For trulye, who knowes not,
that the best sauce, is lacke or want?
               Darius, when in his flyght, he dranke
muddye and stinking water, sayd, that
he neuer dranke a sweter draught.
               For truly, he was neuer afore thirsty,
when he dranke. No 
                     •
                  dre had P
                     •
                  olomeus,
eaten at any time wyth honger.
To whom, when (as he rode his progresse
in Egipte, and strayed from his
garde) a certaine old man gaue a house
hold loafe, in a poore cotage: he sayde,
that he neuer eat sweter bred, in al his
life. They say, that Socrates walkyng
earnestly, towardes the eueninge, and
beinge demaunded, for what cause he
did so: aunswered, that, to thintent he

might suppe the better, he dyd hunt for
hunger. What? see we not the dyet of
the Lacedemonians, in their bankets,
whych they call Philitia? In the which
when the tyran Dionisius, 
                     •
                  n a tyme
supped, he sayed: that their blacke porridge,
whiche was the best parte of the
supper, liked not him. Then the cooke
which made them, aunswered. It is no
meruaile, since you lacke sauce. What
sauce quod he? Mary quod he, the laboure
in huntinge, sweate, runninge,
from the riuer Eurotas, hunger, and
thirst. For these be the sauces of the
Lacedemonians meat. And this truly,
may well be perceyued, not onelye by
the custome of men, but also by beastes
The which, as soone as, any thinge is
set afore them, which is not contrarye
to nature, contentinge theym selues
therewyth, seke no further. Yea whole
cities, taught by custome, are sometimes
delyghted wyth thinne dyet. As
we haue alreadye shewed, of the Lacedemonians.
Xenophon describeth the liuing
of the Persians. Who (as he sayeth)
eate nothing with their bread, but

onely water cresses. Although, if theyr
nature should desyre anye pleasaunter
meate, there are manye fruytes, there
both springing out of the ground, and
also, growyng on the trees, whych excell,
both in pleasure and plentye.
               Ioyne hereunto, the tēperatenes that
commeth of this continencie in liuing:
and the conseruacion, of health. Compare
herewith, those that sweate, and
belche with eating lyke fatte Oxen.
               Then shall you perceyue, that they
whiche moste desire pleasure, do moost
seeldome obtayne it. And, that the pleasure
of meate, consisteth in a hungrye,
and empty stomake, and not in fulnes
and sacietie. They saye, that Timotheus
a noble man in Athenes, and
chiefe of the citie, when on a time he
supped with Plato, and was very well
pleased wyth his cheare: seeinge hym
the next daye after, sayde. Your supper
trulye, is not onelye for the time presente,
but also for manye dayes after
pleasaūt. Also, what a thinge is it, that
beinge muche stuffed with meate and

drynke, we can not vse our wit at libertye?
There is a notable Epistle of Plato,
written to the kynsemen of Dion.
In the whyche, in maner worde for
worde, this is wrytten. Thither when
I came, that, which the Italians, and
Siracusa
                     •
                  s, count a happye life.
               Namelye, to be fed with a great number
of daynty dishes, liked me no whit.
Neyther yet, to be filled twise in a day
nor sit vppe all nighte. And suche lyke
thinges (whych do necessarilye solowe
that kynde of life) litle pleased me. By

                     •
                  
that lyfe be pleasaunt, in the whyche,

And herein, I remember the errour of
that most welthy kinge of Siria, Sar
                  
                     •
                  anapalus.
Who commannded this,
to be grauen on his tombe.

                     Those thinges onelye I thinke I haue
whych while I liue, I eate.
                     And contrary, those I count lost
which I behind me lefte.
                  
               
               
                  
What more meete thing (quod Aristotle)
could a man chose out, to graue on
the tombe of an Oxe, not of a kynge?
He being dead, sayeth he hath all those
thinges, whiche euen whiles he liued,
he had no longer, then whiles he vsed
them. Wherfore then, should we feele
any misse of richesse? Or where wyll
not pouerty suffer vs to be happy? perhaps
in fayre tables, playes, & painted
signes. Do not pore mē enioy the same
better, than they ye are plētifully stored
with them? For there is great store of
all suche thinges in the common buyldinges
of our citye. Whiche they that
haue priuatelye in theyr owne houses,
see neither so manye, neyther yet so often:
onely whē they go downe to their
manours in the countrey. Whom also
many times their consciece prickes,
when they remember, howe, or from
whence, they came by them. A whole
day would be to litle for me, if I should
here pleade the cause of pouerty. Both
it is playne enough of it selfe, and also
daylye experience sets before our eyes,
howe fewe thinges, howe small, and

howe base those are, whych the nature
man requireth. Shall pouertye therefore,
or basenes of birth: yea or the anger
and grudge of the people let a wise
man to be happye? Beware that you
proue not, that this prayse of the people,
and glory that euery man so much
desyreth, doth bring more trouble, then
pleasure. And therefore truly, Demosthenes
was to lyght, who sayde, that it
delyghted him, to heare a woman, as
she wente to fetche water, (as the maner
is in Greece) saye vnto her felowe,
when he passed by. This is that same
Demosthenes. What coulde be more

                     •
                  ondly said? Yet howe famous an oratour
was he? But it appeareth, that
he was wōte to talke much afore other
men, & not to commen with his owne
conscience. We must therefore knowe
this, that neyther hye place, or glorye,
are for theym selues to be desired: neyther
pouertie and basenes to be feared.
For, Democritus sayd. Come to Athenes,
there no man knoweth me.
               A constante man, and a graue trulye:
whych gloryeth that he was withoute

glorye. Shall trumpetters and other
musicians playe and blowe accordyng
as it shall seeme good to thē. And shall
a wyse man, whose arte is farre more
excellent seeke out and folowe not that
that is truest, but what the people lyketh?
Is there any thing more foolysh?
thē, that those, whom takyng one and
one, you despise as slaues and fooles,
to thinke (I saye) that those altogither
are any better? But a wise man
truly, will despise al our ambition, and
lyghtnes. Yea, he will despise all honoure,
though it be profered vnto him.
But we can not despise them, afore repentaunce
driue vs to it. In the bookes
Hermodorus a wryter of naturall philosophye,
there is such a sayenge. He
would, that all the Ephesians should
be put to death. For that, when they
banyshed Hermodorus theyr king, out
of the citie, they spake in this wise. Let
there no man emonges vs be aboue
the rest. Or, if there be any, that would
be so, let him go to some other place,
and amonges other men. Is it not so
in the common people euerye where

likewise? Doth it not spite them, to see
any man, passe all the reste in vertue?
What? Aristides (for I had rather to
bryng forth the examples of the Grecians,
then our owne:) was not he banished
from his coūtrey, because he was
iust aboue al measure, as they thought
What troubles therefore, want they,
whyche haue nothinge to do with the
people? Or what is more pleasaunt thē
leasure bestowed on learninge? Suche
learninge I meane, as teacheth vs the
knoweledge of all nature: the heauen,
the earth, the seas, and all the rest.
               Despising therefore, honoure, and riches,
What is there, that a mā should
feare? Exile perhaps, which is counted
one of the greatest euels. It, if you coūt
to be euell, because of the pleasure and
grudge of the people, then howe litle
we ought to esteeme it, I haue spoken
afore. But if you counte it a misery, to
be from your countrey: then trulye is
euery prouince ful of wretched men, of
whō very fewe retourne home againe
into theyr countrey. But all banyshed
men lose their goods. What thē? haue

we shewed nothinge howe men ought
to beare pouertye? And truly, exyle and
banishement, if we weygh the nature
of the thinge, and not th
                     •
                   shame of the
name, howe much differeth it frō that
continuall wanderinge, in the whyche
these most notable philosophers, Xenocrates,
Crantor, Arcesilas, Lacides,
Aristoteles, Theophrastus, Zeno, Cleanther,
Chrisippus, Antipater, Carneades,
Panetius, Clitomachus, Philo,
Antiochus, Possidonius, and other innumerable,
haue spēt their whole age,
and the course of their life? Who, after
they once departed from theyr countreyes,
neuer came thither agayne.
               And truly, it could put a wyse man (of
whom only our talke is at this presēt)
to no shame at all. Because, no suche
thing, can rightfully come vnto him.
               For such a one, as is ryghtfully banyshed,
we ought not to comfort. To cō
                  clude,
to proue this, we may easely applie
their opinion, who referre al thinges
in this life to pleasure. For in
what soeuer place we haue such thynges,
there we may liue well and happelie.

And therfore, hereunto, that sayeng
of Tencer may well be applyed.
               My countrey (quod he) is, wheresoeuer
I 
                     ••
                  ue well. And Socrates, when one
asked of him whence he was? He aunswered
of the worlde, So, he thoughte
him selfe to be a 
                     〈◊〉
                   and an inhabitaunt
of euery place in the world. Also
Titus Albutius. Did he not, when he
was banished, go to Athenes, & there
studye philosophie? Who also, shoulde
not haue bene banished at all, if he holding
his peace, would haue obeyed the
lawes of Epicurus. And then I praye
you, what was Epicurus the happyer
for that he liued in his countrey: then
Metrodorus liuinge at Athenes? Or
wherein, was Plato more happy then
Xenocrates? Or Polemon, then Arcesilas?
Or howe is that citie to be estemed,
out of the whiche good and wyse
men are banished? Demaratus truly,
the father of Tarquinius our king, because
he coulde not abide the tirants
Cypselus, ca
                     •
                  sed all the Tarquines to
forsake Corinth. And here placed hys
stocke, and encreased his familye. Did

                  
                     •
                  e not wisely preferre, freedome in banishemente,
afore bondage at home?
               But nowe the motions, the cares, and
gryefes of the minde, are swaged with
forgetting the same, and drawynge of
the mind to pleasure. It was not without
some cause therfore, that Epicurus
durst to saye. That a wyse man, hathe
alwayes manye goodes, because he is
alwayes in pleasure. Whereof he thinketh
that it must necessarilye folowe,
that a wyse man is alwayes happye.
            
            
               Hea.
               Yea? if he lacke his sighte? or his
hearing?
            
            
               Mar.
               Yea, For he despyseth
euen these lackes also. And fyrste of all
this horrible blindenes, what pleasure
wants it? Inasmuch as some say, that
all the other pleasures, are wythin the
senses them selues. But those thinges
whych we see, are not anye pleasure to
our eyes. As all those thinges, whiche
we taste, smell, feele, or heare, are in
that selfe same parte where we feele
them. But in the eyes there is no such
thinge. Our minde taketh those thynges
which we see. But the minde may
be delighted, many and diuers wayes,

although our bodye can not see. For
now I speake of a learned man, whose
life is study. His thoughtes and wytte
require not eyes to see that, whyche
wyth his minde he can not see. Truly,
if night can not let a man, but that he
may be happy: why should a day like to
nighte do it? For the aunswere of Appius,
the Cyrenaike, is not so honest,
although it be not much from this purpose.
Whose blindenes when certaine
women did lamente: what meane you
quod he? Is there no pleasure in the
night thinke ye? We perceyue, both by
his offices, and also by his deedes, that
that olde Appius whyche was blynde
many yeres, yet in that his mischaūce
supplied his dutye, bothe at home, and
also abrode in the common welth. Also
we haue heard that the house of Caius
Drusus, was wonte to be full of Clye
                     •
                  tes.
So that wheras they that could
see, could not see theyr owne case, they
were fayne to take a blinde man, to
theyr guyde and counsaylour. Whiles
I was a boye, Cneius Aufidius, who
had bene once Pretor, beynge blynde,

dyd both giue counsaile to his frendes
and wryte an historye in Greeke, and
also had good skill in all learnynge.
               Diodorus the Stoyke, being blinde, liued
manye yeares at my house. He
(which is scarse credible) besydes that,
he did cōtinually take more paynes in
the study of philosophy, thē he did afore
and also played on instrumentes, after
the maner of the Pithagoreans: & had
bookes red vnto him, day and night, in
the whych studyes neuertheles he dyd
not much neede his eyes: yet besides al
this I saye (which may scarse be wtout
eyes) he vsed the practise of Geometry.
Teaching his scolers howe farre, & after
what sort, they should drawe euery
line. They saye, ye Asclepiades, no base
nor meane philosopher, whē one asked
of him, what discōmoditi blindnes had
brought him he answered, that he had
more nede of one boy, to waite on him.
For, like as extreme pouerty were tollerable,
if a man might do as certayne
Greciās may, so likewise may blindenes
easely be borne, if we lacke not helpes,
for our necessity. Democritus hauing
loste his eyes, could not discerne

white & black. But thīges good & euell
iust & vniust, honest & dishonest, profitable
& vnprofitable, he could discerne.
               So, although wtout the sight of sundry
coloures he could liue happelye, yet wt
                  out
the knowledge of thinges he could
not. And he also thought yt ye iudgemēt
& quicknes of y• mind was hindred by ye
sight of ye eyes. And wheras other men
scarseli can se y•, which lieth afore their
feete, he beheld in his minde the whole
nature of eueri thing, so y• nothīg could
be hidden frō him. It is sayd also, that
Homere was blinde. But y• they maye
say, y• see his picture, & not his poetry.
For what region, what coaste, what
place of Greece, what shape of beauty,
what battel, what army what stirre of
mē or beasts, is not so expressed in him?
that, those thinges which he him selfe
saw not yet he hath made vs to se, who
neuer beheld y• same? Thē what delite
or plesure of ye mind, did either Homer
or any other learned mā, ye was blinde
wāt at any time? none truly. For other
wise, wold Anaragoras, or ye same Demo
                     •
                  ritus
of whō we nowe spake, haue
left their lāds & enheritaūce & geuē thē
                  selues,

to this heauenly delyght, of study
and learninge? Also Tiresias the
southsayer, whom the Poetes fayne to
haue bene a wise mā, they neuer bring
in complayning his blyndenes. But
Homere, faynīg Poliphemus to haue
bene a rude, and a huge gyant, maketh
him talking wyth a ramme, commending
his good chaūce, for that he could
see to go where he woulde, and touche
what he listed. And trulye, that talke
was well applyed to such a person.
               For he was no wiser then the ramme,
wyth whom he talked. But in deafenes
what euell is there? Marcus Crassus
was somewhat deafe. But there
was one thing worse than that, belonging
to him. Namelye, that he had an
euell reporte. Although that trulye, in
my opinion, was wythout cause. Our
Epicures can not vnderstande, nor
speake Greeke. Neyther the Greeke,
Epicures latine. They therefore were
deafe in these mens language. And
likewise, these men in theyrs. And all
men in those languages whiche they
vnderstand not, are no better thā deafe

But some man will say. They can not
heare the sweete noyse, of any instrument.
No more can they the gratinge
or iarring of a sawe, when he is whe
                     •
                  
                  ted:
neyther the squeakynge of a pigge
when he is sticked: neyther, when they
are disposed to take theyr rest, the roaringe
of the mayne sea. And if they 
                     〈◊〉
                  
so greatly delyghted wyth songes and
instrumentes: they oughte to consider
that afore anye suche thinges were inuented,
there were manye wyse men,
that ledde a happye lyfe. And also, that
there may be farre greater pleasure taken,
in readinge, then hearings suche
toyes. Furthermore, as we did afore
commende vnto blynde men, the pleasures
of the eares: so we maye vnto
deafe men, commende the pleasures of
the eyes. And furthermore, who soeuer
can commen secretelye with his owne
conscience, he shall not neede the talke
of another. Nowe let all these miseries
be put together. So that some mā
lacke both his syght and hearinge: and
furthermore be payned wyth extreame
gryefe in his body: whych both of themselues

are able at the first to kil a man
or els if they tary any thinge longe, do
pricke a man more vehementlye, then
that he should haue occasion to abide
thē, yet what neede we to trouble oure
selues? Inasmuch as, there is alwayes
a hauen & baye readye for vs. Death I
meane, the euerlastinge home of oure
body, when it is once past sence. Theodorus,
whē Lisimacus threatned him,
that he would put him to death, sayde.
Surely youre power is great, if you be
able to do asmuche, as a Cantarides.
Paulus whē Perses desired him, that
he might not be led in his triumph: answered.
That is in your choyce. Of
death we spake much the first day whē
we disputed purposely of it & sumwhat
also, the next day, whē we entreated of
gryefe, we sayd thereof: which who soeuer
doth remember, there is no doubt
but he wil either wishe for death, or at
the least wise not feare it. I thinke that
herein, we ought to kepe that custome
which the Grecians vse in their feastes
for they haue such a terme. Eyther let
him drink or els depart. And but right
For, eyther let him wyth other kepe
feloweship in drinkinge: or els, least he

being sober, should be in the companye
of dronkardes, he must departe before.
So likewise, the iniuries of fortune,
which we cā not abide, we ought to auoyde
by flight. The same that Epicurus
sayeth, Hieronimus also affirmeth
almost with the selfe same wordes.
               Therfore if these philosophers, which
think, vertue of it selfe to be of no force
& that al that, which we cal honest and
laudable, is but a vaine thing, only coloured
with a fayre name: if these men
neuerthelesse, thinke, that a wyse man
is alwayes happy: what thē should we
looke for, of Socrates, Plato, & other
more excellēt philosophers? Of yt whiche
some saye, that the goodes of the
minde are of such excellencie, that they
blemishe all the goodes of the bodye, &
of fortune. And some other count these
to be no goods at al, but place al things
in y• minde only. Whose controuersie,
Carneades was wonte to finishe like
an honourable iudge. For he said, that
there was no cause of controuersie betwixt
thē, although, those things which
the peripatetike
                     •
                   did cal goods, yt Stoikes
did count but cōmodities: so y• the
Peripatetikes did attribute no more

to ryches, good health, and other suche
like, then the Stoikes, when it comes
to the pdndering of the thinge it selfe,
and not of the word. And, as for the
philosophers of other sectes, howe they
can haue any place in this opinion, let
them selues see. Yet I am glad, that
they professe some thinge worthye the
name of philosophers, of the ablenes
of a wise man to liue well. But, inasmuch
as, in the morninge we must go
from hēce, let vs nowe penne out these
our fyue dayes disputations. I trust,
that I shall at the laste, haue some leasure
to set theym abrode. For wherein
may I better employe this litle leasure
that I haue? And to my frende Brutus
we will sende these fiue bookes, by
whom I was not onely moued, but also
prouoked to wryte of philosophy.
               Wherein, howe much we shal profyte
other men, I can not well say. But for
mine owne sharpest sorowes, and sondry
troubles, that on all sides compassed
me, I could finde no
better remedye.
