                     I doe forgiue them.
                  
                  
                     To the ſtate I ne're ment ill
                     welladay, welladay,
                     neither wiſht ye commons ill,
                     in all my life:
                     But loued all with my heart,
                     And alwayes tooke their part
                     Whereas there was deſart,
                     In any place.
                  
                  
                     Then mildely did he craue
                     mournefully mournefully,
                     He might that fauour haue
                     priuate to pray:
                     He then prayed heartely,
                     And with great feruency,
                     To God thae ſits on hie,
                     For to receiue him.
                  
                  
                     And then he prayed againe
                     mournfully mournfully,
                     God to preſerue his Quéene
                     from all her foes:
                     And ſend her long to raigne,
                     True Iuſtice to maintaine,
                     And not to let proude Spaine,
                     
                     Once to offend her.
                  
                  
                     His gowne he ſlipt of then
                     welladay welladay,
                     And put off his hat and band
                     and hung it by,
                     Praying ſtill continually,
                     To God that ſits on hie,
                     That he might patiently,
                     There ſuffer death.
                  
                  
                     My headeſman that muſt be,
                     then ſaide he chéerefullie,
                     Let him come héere to me,
                     That I may him ſée:
                     Who knéeled to him then,
                     Art thon (quoth he) the man,
                     Which art appointed now,
                     my life to frée?
                  
                  
                     Yes my Lord did he ſay
                     welladay, welladay,
                     Forgiue me I you pray
                     for this your death:
                     I heare doe thée forgiue,
                     And may true iuſtice liue,
                     No foule crime to forgiue,
                     Within their place.
                  
                  
                     then he knéeled down againe,
                     mournefully mournfully,
                     And was required by ſome
                     there ſtanding by:
                     To forgiue his enemies.
                     Before death cloſde his eyes
                     which he did in heartie wiſe,
                     Thanking them for it.
                  
                  
                     That they would rememher him
                     welladay, welladay;
                     That he might forgiue al them, leaue
                     that had him wrōg'd:
                     Now my Lords I take my,

                     Now when you wil prepare,
                     For I am readie.
                  
                  
                     He laid his head on the bl

                     Then his doublet off put he,
                     and laid downe againe.
                  
                  
                     Then his headeſman did his part
                     cruelly, cruelly,
                     He was neuer ſéene to ſtart,

                  A lamentable new Ballad vpon the Earle of Eſſex death.
                  To the tune of the Kings laſt Good-night.
                  
                     
                  
                  
                     ALL you that cry, O hone O hone
                     
                     come now and ſing, O Lord with me,
                     For why our Iewell is from vs gone,
                     the valiant Knight of Chiualrie:
                     Of rich and poore beloued was he,
                     in time an honorable Knight,
                     When by our Lawes condemd to dye,
                     and lately tooke his laſt Good night.
                  
                  
                     Count him not like to Saint nor Campion,
                     
                     (thoſe traitrous men) or Babington,
                     
                     Nor like the Earle of Weſtmerland,
                     
                     by whom a number were vndone:
                     He neuer yet hurt mothers ſonne,
                     his quarrell ſtil maintaind the right:
                     Which makes yt tears my cheeks down run:
                     when I thinke on his laſt Good-night.
                  
                  
                     The Portingales can witnes be,
                     his Dagger at Liſbone gate he flung,
                     And like a knight of Chiualrie,
                     his chaine vpon the gate he hung:
                     Would God that he would thither come,
                     to fetch them both in order right:
                     Which thing was by his honor done,
                     yet lately tooke his laſt Good-night.
                  
                  
                     The Frenchmen they can teſtifie,
                     the towns of Gourney he tooke in:
                     And marched to Roane immediately,
                     not caring for his foes a pin.
                     With bullets then he pierced their ſkin,
                     and made them flée far from his ſight:
                     He at that time did credit win,
                     and now hath tane his laſt Good-night.
                  
                  
                     And ſtately Cales can witnes well:
                     euen by his Proclamation right,
                     He did command them all ſtraightly,
                     to haue a care of Infants liues:
                     That none ſhould raviſh maide nor wife,
                     Which was againſt their order right:
                     Therefore they praid for his long life,
                     which lately tooke his laſt Good-night.
                  
                  
                     Would God he had ne're Ireland knowne,
                     nor ſet his féet on Flanders ground:
                     Then might we well inioyed our owne,
                     where now our Iewell will not be found.
                     Which makes our woes ſtill to abound,
                     trickling with ſalt teares in my ſight:
                     To heare his name in our eares to found,
                     Lord Deuereux tooke his laſt Goodnight.
                  
                  
                     Aſhwedneſday that diſmall day,
                     when he came forth of his Chamber doore,
                     Vpon the Scaffold there he ſaw,
                     his headſman ſtanding him before.
                     The Nobles all they did deplore,
                     ſhedding their ſalt teares in his ſight:
                     He ſaid, farewell to rich and poore,
                     at his good morrow and good-night.
                  
                  
                     Farewell Elizabeth my gratious Quéene,
                     God bleſſe thée and thy counſell all:
                     Farewell my Knights of Chiualrie,
                     farewell my ſoldiers ſtout and tall:
                     Farewell the Commons great and ſmall,
                     into the hands of men I light:
                     My life ſhall make amends for all,
                     for Eſſex bids the world good-night.
                  
                  
                     Farewell deare wife and children thrée,
                     farewell my young and tender ſon,
                     Comfort your ſelues mourne not for me,
                     although your fall be now begun:
                     My time is come the glaſſe is run,
                     comfort your ſelues in former light,
                     Séeing by my fall you are vndone,
                     your Father bids the world Good-night.
                  
                  
                     
                        Derrick thou knowſt at Cales I ſav'd
                     thy life, loſt for a rape there done,
                     Which thou thy ſelfe canſt teſtifye,
                     thine owne hand thrée and twenty hung:
                     But now thou féeſt my time is come,
                     by chance into thy hands I light.
                     Strike out thy blow that I may know,
                     thou Eſſex lou'dſt at his good-night.
                  
                  
                     When England counted me a Papiſt,
                     the workes of Papiſts I defie,
                     I nere worſhipt Saint, nor Angell in heauen,
                     nor to the Virgin Mary I,
                     But to Chriſt which for my ſinnes did dye,
                     trickling with ſad teares in his ſight:
                     Spreading my armes to God on high,
                     Lord Ieſus, receiue my ſoule this night.
