            Belowed brethren I gyue laude ād thākes vnto my God / for he hath made you rych in all godly virtue / for youre faith groweth excedingly / and eueryche one of you floweth ower in lowe to warde a nother amōge youre ſylfes and to warde al mē. God hath bleſſed you / with all maner of ſpiritual bleſſinges / in heuēly thinges / by Chriſte / accordinge as he hath choſen you in hym thorow lowe / before ye fundation of the worlde was layd. And he hath ordeyned you to be holy / ād without blame in his ſight / and hath choſen you before vnto hym ſylfe / to

be heyres of his eternal glory thorow Ieſus Chriſt / by whom ye haue redemption / that is to ſaye / forgeuinge of ſynnes. And he hath openned vnto you / the miſtery of his wil. And hath ſealed you with ye ſprite of promes / which is the erneſt of youre enheritance / to redeme the poſſeſſion purchaſſed vnto the laude of his glory. Wherfore I gyue thankes vnto my God / and prayes for you with gladnes / becauſe of the felliſhippe which ye haue in the Goſpel from the firſt daye vnto now. And I am ſure certifieth of this / that he which begāne an good worke in you / ſhal performe it vnto the daye of Ieſus Chriſt / as it becommeth me to iudge of you all. Thankes be vnto God beloweth brethern / ye neade nor to be teach it of any mā for that oyntment which ye haue receawith theachit you all thynges. Nor withſtōdinge I wil not be negligent to put you in remembraunce of youre dutie / thought ye knowe it youre ſylfes / and are alſo ſtabiliſſhed in the preſent trueth.

When i am abſent by writtinge vnto a proſperous iorney (by the will of God) fortune me to come vnto you / ād haue cōſolacion to gyther with you thorow ye cō

And aboue in you ſome what i truſt and reioyce / ād that cauſeth me to writ this litle treatyſe rather vnto you / then to any other. And euer i wil exhort you / as my well beloweth brethern in the lorde / beſechynge you to receaue it with pacience. And thought my knowdledge a greith not well to ſoch an office / yet after the grace geuen vnto me of God / i haue obeyit. In the which ye that are of faith / ſhall feale hys

               ¶Of faith
               
                  BElowed brethren aboue all thinge be ſtronge and ſtedfaſt in youre faith / Ephe. vi as S Paul teached. Aboue all / take ye ye ſhelde of faith / wherwith ye maye quench all the fyrie dartes of ye wicked.i. Petri v. Therfore be ye ſober and watch for youre aduerſary the deuil as an roringe Lion walker about / ſekinge whom he maye denore / whom reſiſt ſtedfaſt in the Faith As Ihon ſaith ī his reuelation Beholde ye deuil ſhal caſt of you in preſone / Apoca. ii to tēpte you be faithful vnto the deeth / & I ſhall geue y• an croune of lyfe. Vithout this faith ſaith Paul / Hebreo. xi It is vnpoſſible to pleaſe God. Therfore be ſtronge in youre faith. This faith is

the very rocke where on the chirch is hildeth as ſaith oure ſaueour / Math. xvi ap one this rocke I vilbilde my congregation / i Corin. iij. And Paul ſaith in an other place. No man can laye a nother fundation then that which is layde which is Ieſus Chriſt / that is tho ſaye / yt faith of Ieſus Chriſt / and in an other place ſaith he / ye nowe are no moare ſtrangers ād foreners / Ephe. ij. but citeſins with the ſaynctes and of the houſholde of God / and are bildet apō the fundacion of the Apoſtles and Prophetes / Ieſus Chriſt beynge the heed corner ſtone / in whom euery bildinge coupled to gether / groweth vnto an holy temple in the lorde / in whom ye alſo are but to gether / and made an habitacion for God in ye ſprite.Apo. xxvi The fundacion of the wal of the cite ſaith Ihone was garniſſhed with all maner of precious ſtonis. The fundacion of the cite of Ieruſalē (the chirch of almigty God) is faith which is garniſſhed with the greate mercy and goodnes of God abundantly / as with all maner of precious ſtonis / or with all kynde of good workes precious & acceptable vnto God / for faith can nor be ydel / bot worketh thorowe lowe / Galath. 
                        •

Faith thorow lowe is myghty in operacion / Gala. v Gala. 3. iiij Roma. v i Corin. xiij Apoca. xxi for faith bryngeth the ſprite of God and the ſprite of God bryngeth lowe. And lowe worketh no ewil / but al good So faith continualy worketh good to all man / and maye be callit the fūdaciō garniſhed with all maner of precious ſtonis. For by faith ve are iuſtifieth / and made righteous before God.Roma. iij As it is written. Nowe merely is the righteueſnes that commeth of God / declared without the fulfillinge of the lawe hauinge witnes both of the lawe & of ye Prophetes. The righteueſnes no dout which is good before God / commeth by the faith of Ieſus Chriſt / vnto all & apon all that beleue. For there is no difference: all haue ſynned / and lacke the prayſe that is of valoure before God / but are iuſtified frely by his grace thorow the redemption that is in Chriſt Ieſu / whom God hath made an ſeate of mercy / thorow faith in his bloud / to ſhewe the righteueſnes which before hym is of valoure / in that he forgeueth the ſynnes that are paſſhed / which God did ſofre to ſheue at this tyme / the righteueſnes that is alowed of hym / that he myght be counted iuſte / and an iuſtifiar of hym that beleuith on Ieſus Chriſt. Where is then thy

reioyſinge? it is excludet. By what lawe? by the lawe of workes? naye but by the lawe of faith. We ſuppoſe therfore that an man is iuſtified by faith / without the deades of the lawe. Ys he God of the iewes only? ys he not the God alſo of the gentyls? he is (no dout) God alſo of the gentyls / for it is God only which iuſtified circumciſion / which of faith / and vncircumciſiō thorow faith
               ¶Yf Abraham were iuſtified by deades then hath he wherin to reioyce / but not with God. For what ſaith the ſcripture.Roma. iiij. Abraham beleued God / Gene. xv and it was counted vnto hym for righteueſnes
               ¶To hym that worketh the rewarde is not reckened of fauour / but of duety. To hym that worketh not / but beleueth on hym that iuſtified the vngodly / is faith reckened for righteueſnes.Pſal. xxxi Euen as Dauid deſcribeth the bleſſed fulnes of an man / vnto whom God aſcribeth righteueſnes without deades. Bleſſed are they / whoſe vnrighteueſnes is forgeuen / and whoſe ſynnes are couered / bleſſed is that man / to whom the lorde imputeth not ſynne. Cam this bleſſednes

then apon the circumciſed or apon the vncircūciſed? we ſaye verely howe yat faith was reckened to Abrahā for righteueſnes Howe was it reckened?Gene. xv In the time of circumciciſion / or in the time before he was circumciſed? Not in the time of circumciſion / but when he was yet vncircumciſed And he receaued the ſigne of circumciſion as an ſeale of that righteueſnes which is by faith / Gene. xvii which faith he had / yet beynge vncircumciſed. That he ſhulde be the father of all them that beleue / thougt they be not circumciſed / that righteueſnes myght be imputed to them alſo. Abraham was made ſtronge in the faith / and gaue honour to God / and ſtedfaſtly beleued that he which had made the promes was able alſo to make it good / and therfore was it reckened to hym for righteueſnes.Roma. iiij. It is not written for hym only / that it was reckened to hyme for righteueſnes / but alſo for vs / to whom it ſhal be counted for righteueſnes / ſo we beleue on hym that reyſed vppe Ieſus the lorde frō deeth. As ſaith Paul be cauſe that we are iuſtified by faith / we are at peace with God / Roman
                        •
                     . v thorow oure lorde Ieſus Chriſt. The Gētils which foloweth not righteueſnes / Roma. ix haue ouer takē righteueſnes. I meane ye righteueſnes which cōmeth of

faith. But Iſrael which foloweth the lawe of righteueſnes / coulde not attayne vnto ye lawe of righteueſnes. And wherfore? becauſe they ſought it not by faith / but as it were by the workes of the lawe. For they haue ſtombled at the ſtomblinge ſtone. As it is writtē Beholde I put in Syō an ſtomblinge ſtone and an rocke on which ſhal men faule / Eſai. xxviij & none that beleue on hym ſhalbe aſhamed.Romano. x I beare Iſrael recorde ſayth Paul / that they haue an feruent mynde to God warde / but not accordinge to knouledge. For they are ignoraunt of the righteueſnes / which is aloued before God / ād goo about to ſtabliſſhe their aune righteueſnes. And therfore are not obedient vnto the righteueſnes which is of value before God. For Chriſt is the ende of the lawe / to iuſtifie all that beleue / ād in ye ſame chap. ſaith he. The beleue of ye herte iuſtified. And in an other place. We knowe yt no man is iuſtified by the deades of lawe / but by the faith of Ieſus Chriſt / Gala. iii. and we haue beleuet on Ieſus Chriſt / that we myght be iuſtified by ye faith of Chriſt / and noth by the deades of the lawe.Gala. iii Abraham beleued God / and it was counted vnto hym for righteueſnes / vnderſtonde therfore that they which are of faith / are the childerne of Abraham. The ſcripture ſawe afore honde that God wolde iuſtifie the gentils thorow
