            At our vprising.
            
               GOd the Father, that saidst in the beginning, Let light be made, & it was made: lighten my eies, Psalm. 12. that I sleepe not in death, lest at any time mine enemie say vnto me, I haue preuailed against him.
            God the sonne, light of light, the great & truest light, from whence this light both of sunne and day ariseth, thou light shining in darkenesse, and illuminating euery one Iohn 1. that commeth into this worlde: driue from me all darknes of ignorance: and giue me vnderstanding, that in thee, and by thee I may know the Father: to know whom, is to liue: and to serue whom, is to reigne.
            God the holy Ghost, thou fire both illuminating, and warming,

kindle in me thy light, that I may know the deceitful delights of this world, and the true ioyes of heauen: Enlighten my minde, that I may see how great a good our enemy soliciteth vs to change for a light shadow. Grant that I may onely see those things yt are thine, and be blinde to the rest: infuse also into my minde the gift of thy charity, that forsaking those transitorie things, I may with a feruent zeale and continuel desire, endeuour to attaine those things, which are eternall.
            Holy Trinity, one God, defend me this day from all the assaults of the diuell: keepe me this day from all sin and defend me this day from sudden and vnexpected death. Be thou vnto me solace in tribulatiō, assistance in temptation, and in death a pleasant refuge.
            Thou hest raised my body (O Lord) which was drowned in sleep, I beseech thee that thou wilt deliuer my soule likewise from the sleep of sins, & the darknes of this world: and that which thou hast recalled from sleepe vnto waking,

may it please thee after death to restore to the same life: for sleepe is to thee, as death to vs. To thee be praise & cleernes, wildome, thanksgiuing, Apoc. 7. honor, vertue, & fortitude, for euer and-euer. Amen.
            
               When we rise.
               RIse, O my soule that sleepest, arise from death, & Christ shal Ephe. 5. shine vnto thee: Arise O thou daughter of Sion, O my soule redeemed by Christs blood, shake off the dust of sinnes, & set in thee the Esay 52. peace of Christ, purchased for thee by his merits.
               Christ, thou mercifull aduocate of mankind, as thou releeuest this greeuous burthen of my body by thy benefit, so lift vp our minds to the knowledge & loue of thy Maiesty: and grant that the body may be a companion & Minister of pietie to the soule in this life, to the end that in the life to come, it may be partaker of that eternal blessednes, where thou liuest & reignest, with God the Father, and the holy Ghost, world without end
               Amen.
            
            
               
               A thankesgiuing for our preseruation the night past, together with a prayer wherin we beseech almighty God to take the like care of vs this day.
               OMnipotent & eternall Lord, the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ: I praise thee. I blesse thee, and with my whole heart giue thee thanks, that according to thy vnmeasurable goodnes, thou hast by thy fatherly prouidence, preserued me this night: that it hath pleased thee to be present with me, so that the diuell durst not drawe neere to assaile me: that thou hast protected me from all euill, both of soule and body; that thou hast defended me (being drowned in profound sleepe) by the assistance of thy holy Angels, as it were with an impregnable wall against the deceits and snares of the old aduersary, who neuer letteth slip any opportunity to hurt vs: Finally, for that thou hast sweetly raised me from

sleepe, (the true image of death) lest I should bee choaked in the darknesse of my sins, to the end I might haue space and time (yet at the length) to recollect, and earnestly repent my selfe.
               Now likewise (O father of mercy and God of all consolation) 2 Cor. 1. I beseech thee (and from the bottome of my heart intreat thee) that this day thou wilt take me also into thy fatherly protection, and behold me with thy mercifull eies, direct me in the way of thy commaundments, and giue me those gifts of thy holy spirit, by whose means I may begin, continue, and end this day likewise to the praise and glory of thy holy name, to the profit of my neighbors, and the saluation of my soule: endeuouring my selfe euery where and in all things, without neglect of my duty, to discharge euery way that vocation to which I am called.
               Keep me (O Lord) from all sin; restraine my flesh and blood prone to all iniquitie, and friend and minister to that old Adam: coole, by the dewe of thy spirit, the heate of

concupiscence, that reigneth in my members, lest this day at any time I fall into any sinne, and prouoke thy wrath and indignation against me. Grant O mercifull father, and vouch safe (O deere Lord) that I may lead the remnant of my life in thy feare and loue.
               Direct this day my heart and my body, my senses, speeches, and my actions in thy law, & in the workes of thy commaundements. Turne my hart from all transitory things and conuert it to eternal: that forsaking the riches and delights of this world, I may alwaies thirst after thy kingdome.
               Curb and restraine the power of the diuell, our old and sworne enemie, that although hee rangeth about like a roaring Lion, seeking whom he may deuoure, he may not yet hurt, or any wayes hinder mee. But because my merits are none at al for which I deserue to be heard, behold I bring with me thy onely begotten Son, who is the propitiation for my sins: behold him O mercifull father, and for the iustice sake of thy Son, forgiue the sins

of thy seruant: grant mee that by thy mercy, which is not my due in iustice: who liuest & reignest God for euer and euer.
               Amen.
            
         
         
            Morning exercises.
            
               1. The commemoration of benefits receiued.
               O God my God, early doe I Psalm. 66. wake vnto thee, 
                     •…
                  aith y• thy holie Prophet. And a little after he addeth: so I was mindfull of thee on my bed: early in the morning will I think on thee, because thou wert mine helper. And I my Lord God with that holy king desire to watch. Let this be the beginning of my occupations: let the day beginne with this thought of mine. For heereunto the duties driue me whereby I am bound vnto thee: this is the end of my creation: for I was therefore made to the end I should praise thee, & glorifie, magnifie, and sanctifie thy name. For thou art the beginning and the end of all things: I say the beginning without beginning:

and the end without end. For euen as no man might euer create any thing without thee: so could not any thing be created by any other but by thee: to the end that all things might serue thee, praise thee, and publish thy glory.
               Thou art the vniuersall dispenser of good things, so that there is no benefit to be found either of nature or grace, body or soule, which taketh not his originall from thee, who art the fountaine of all goodnes. Thou art the maine of all perfection, the Abysse of all greatnesse, the D
                     •…
                  ean of infinite mercy and goodnes, the image of incomparable beauty, Thou art the God of Gods, the holy of holiest, the King of Kinges, the Lord of Lords, the cause of causes, the being of beings, the life of the liuing, the order of the Uniuers, the beauty of the world, the glory of the heauens.
               Thou art my Creator, that madest me of nothing to thine owne Image and similitude: Thou art my conseruer, who by thy prouidēce maintainest me, lest I should

become nothing Thou art my sanctifier, who by thy grace extollest me vnto things which are diuine.
               Thou art my glorifier, who hast made me to enioy the glorie euerlasting. Thou art my defender, helper, pastor, & benefactor. Thou art my King, my Lord, my father, my spouse. Thou art the center of my soule; my last end, in whom alone consisteth all my felicity, happinesse, and the last perfection of my life: what neede many words? Thou art to me all in all, in as much as thou art God.
               But in as much as thou art man, thou art my redeemer, my sauiour, and deliuerer: Thou art (as the Apostle testifieth) my wisedome, my 1. Cor. 1. iustice, my sanctification, my redemption, my sacrifice, my Lambe, my priest, my aduocate, my intercessor, my doctor, my example, my fortitude, my consolation. Thou art the generall phisition of all my wounds & infirmities. Thou hast healed my pride by thy humility: my auarice, by thy pouerty; my pleasures by thy dolors; my wrath, by thy meeknes: my enuy by thy charity:

my excesse by the gall and vinegar which thou tastedst for my sake: my sloath by thy diligence, and vnmeasurable labors vndertaken for my sake.
               For my sake thou didst fast, wander hither and thither, sweate, watch, pray, weepe: for mee thou wert banished, persecuted, de
                     •…
                  ded, mockt, spit vpon, whipt, crowned with thornes, crucified, and more afflicted than all other men of this world, and at length put to death.
            
            
               2. A thanksgiuing.
               ALL these are thy benefits, O Lord, for which I ought to yeeld thee thanks nay rather they are most iust causes for which I am indebted vnto thee & bonds, by which thou holdest me captiue & bound vnto thee. What shall I giue vnto our Lord, for all the benefits Psal. 115. hee hath bestowed on mee? by what duty, or what humble seruice shall I recompence so manie graces bestowed vpon me? Uerily I beleeue, that although I onely

had all mens hearts, and with all them did only loue thee: yet might I not in the least sort yeeld thee that which belongeth vnto thee. How then for many & so great benefits shall I yeeld thee satisfaction? How can I deny thee that one heart which I haue for all, whē I owe thee so much, for all thy benefits towards me? What shal I say my God? what shall I doe? for I alone am not sufficiēt to yeeld thee condigne thanks for such a multitude of blessings. But I know what I shall doe: I will call vpon all creatures that are in heauen & on earth, and I will desire them to assist me, and vouch safe with me to sing thy praises, and glorifie with mee the Lord of all glorie. Let vs therefore sing the song which the three children sang in the burning Furnace in Babilon, saying:
               O blesse ye, all the workes of the Lord God, praise ye and magnifie him for euer.
               O yee angels of the Lord, blesse yee the Lord, praise him and magnifie him for euer.
               O yee heauens, blesse the Lord,

praise yee and magnifie him for euer.
               O yee waters that are aboue the firmament, blesse yee our Lord, praise him and magnifie him for euer. &c.
            
            
               3. The oblation of a mans selfe.
               ALL these praises and blessings doe I owe thee (O father) yea, and far more greater belong vnto thee. For if I shal more neerely examine the matter, I not only owe thee mine, but my selfe also. For if in India, a man buy another man for a red cap, and hee that is bought at so slight a rate, is in such sort wholly obliged & subiect to the buier, as that he is neither master of a moment of time, or of a farthing, but is very often cast into fetters by his Lord, beaten with clubs, and handled according to the humour of him that bought him: what shall become of me O Lord? I am thine, yea truly wholy thine, not tied vnto thee vnder one

name and title, but by infinite respects. Thou hast created me, thou hast bought me, not with a red cap, but with thy precious blood: thou hast conserued me in all and euery momēt of my life. For without thee I can nether stir hād or foot: without thy prouidence I can neither breath nor respire or act any thing: with what colour thē can I cast off thy dominion ouer me? How an I deny thee that which is thine? By what right can I challenge liberty to my selfe? Or with what impudence (shaking off the yoake of my Lord) can I wish to liue according to my wicked desires, when by so many reasons, I am thine, & ought so wholy to be dedicated vnto thee?
               Most humbly therfore acknowledging thy dominion ouer me, behold I dedicate my self wholy vnto thee, and intirely submit my selfe to thy perpetuall seruice & subiection. Neither doe I onely offer my selfe vnto thee, but also all that which is mine, what soeuer this day, or in the rest of my life, I shall thinke, speake, or do: with all those things which at any time for thy sake shal

be offered me to admit or further 
                     〈◊〉
                   so that henceforward I wil neither eat, nor drink, nor sleep, nor do any such like thing, whose end shall not bee the honour & glory of thy most holy name.
               Once more I say, O Lord I sacrifice my selfe vnto thee, lest hereafter I be mine owne & not thine: I will liue no more according to mine owne will, I will not labour for my selfe, I wil not seek my selfe; but in all things, & euery way will I seeke thee, obey thy will, and be diligent in thy seruice: and if at any time I shall doe the contrary, I will call my selfe a theefe and rauisher of an other mans right; for that dutie and obedience which vnder so many titles, and by so much right appertaineth vnto thee, deniing and stealing the same from thee, I shall vsurpe vnto my selfe.
            
            
               4. A petition for new benefits.
               BUt because without thy grace I cannot yeeld thee that duty, I pray thee (O Lord) that thou

wilt assist me herein, and create in me a new heart that shal not iudge himselfe to be his own, no, not for 
                     〈◊〉
                   moment of time, but shall thinke 
                     〈◊〉
                   lost whatsoeuer is not imployed in thy honour and seruice: giue me a will, that may desire nothing more than to keepe thy commandements and obey thy wil: giue me an vnderstanding, that may meditate on thy law day and night, and such a memory as may neuer be forgetfull of thee.
               Furthermore (O Lord) giue a bridle to my tongue, & set a watch before mine eyes. Grant me the puritie of heart, the austerity of the f
                     •…
                  esh, the mortification of all appe
                  
                     •…
                  es and perturbations of the minde. Finally, giue me a grounded humility of heart, and with it patience, obedience, meeknesse, chastity, true discretion: with these pouerty of spirit, feruent zeal of thine honor, the loue of my neighbour, and sincere compassion of an other mans tribulations. Who liuest & reignest world without end.
               Amen.
            
         
         
            
            A Cōmendatory morning praier, wherin, together with our selues we commend all faithfull Christians vnto God.
            I Adore, blesse, and glorifie thee 
                  〈◊〉
                holy Trinity, omnipotent God Father, Son, and holy Ghost. Behold I offer vp my selfe to thy diuine maiesty, and yeeld me tributary to thy most holy and irreuocable will. I pray thee (O Lord) take from me, & from all faithfull christians whatsoeuer is displeasant vnto thee: and giue whatsoeuer is gratefull in thine eies, and cause vs become such as thou commandest vs to be. I commend vnto thee my father, my mother, brothers, sisters, sons, cousins, benefactors, friends, familiars, & neighbors, and all those that haue recō
               mended themselues to our praiers, or for whō I ought to pray. I cō
               mend vnto thee, thy holy catholike Church: bring to passe (O Lord) that all and euery one may know thee: all may honour thee: all may

loue thee, and may likewise be beloued by thee. Reduce the ignorant into the right way: destroy heresies, let all those bee conuerted to the true and sincere faith, who haue no knowledge of thy most holy name. Giue vs peace, and conserue vs in the same: yet in all things, let thy will, not our will, bee fulfilled: Comfort and helpe all those that are in tribulation, and such as leade their liues in miseries, temptations, perturbations, and afflictions, as well of the body as the soule. Finally, I commend all creatures to thy protection, that to the liuing thou m

            A praier before we goe out of doores.
            OMnipotent & eternall God, who art the way the life, and the truth, behold I am to walke amidst the snares of the diuell, the world his minister, laid in waite for me: I beare likewise about

mee the temptations of my fraile flesh, so that it cannot be that I shall walke without harme, tither of body or soule, amongst so many gulfs & dangerous heaps of tēptations, which that cursed enemy hath beset vs with, being swallowed in sin, except thou stretch thy right hand to assist vs. Leade mee therfore, thou most assured & faithfull guide: open mine eies, & conduct me in the high way, that I Psal. 24. may neither turne on the right nor on the left hand: Shewe mee thy Prou. 4. pathes, & teach me thy waies: make my path straight, & direct my iournies in peace. O Lord, in thy righteousnesse Psal. 5. leade me because of mine enemies: direct thou my waies in thy sight: Thou that to holy men sendedst thine Angels for guardians, by whom as the weaker sons they should be directed as by their elder and more stronger brothers: Thou that to To

in thy goodnesse, thy holy Angel, who may now leade mee in these paths that are most pleasant in thy sight, and at length bring mee to the hauen of eternall life: In the Name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and the holy Ghost,
            Amen.
         
         
            When you enter any iourney.
            O God that broughtest Abraham thy seruant from Vr of the Chaldees and keptst him in safety in the whole course of his pilgrimage: we beseech thee vouchsafe to keepe vs thy seruants. Be vnto vs, O Lord, in our setting out, our succour: in our way our solace: in heate, a shelter: in raine and cold, a garment: in wearines, a wagon: in aduersity, a helper: in the slippery way, a staffe: in shipwrack a hauen: that by thy conduct wee may attaine thither with happines whither we trauell, and at last returne in safety to our owne households, through Iesus Christ our Lord.
            Amen.
         
         
            
            A praier before the Sermon.

               aluation: Behold I come to heare thy word, and haue many yeares since repaired to the same: (but alas) with small fruit of my soule: I came vnto the light, and I am not illuminated: to the bread of life, & behold I die for hunger: to the fire, and I starue for cold: to the medicine, & 
                  〈◊〉
                am oppressed with diuerse infirmities of sinne. The dew of diuine doctrine falleth without intermissiō vpō my earth, and yet hitherto hath it brought forth nothing but thorns and thistles: what need more? daies, mōths and yeeres are past, and I remain in the same state of sinne.
            It is a great benefit O Lord, that thou hast left vs the seed of thy diuine

word, otherwise we had bene like Sodome and Gomorra. It is likewise a great benefite that thou sendest laborers into thy vineyard, that thou leauest vs Doctors and Catholicke preachers: but in vaine teach they outwardly, except thou mooue inwardly. I beseech thee therefore (O good Iesus) open the eares of my heart, that that which is instilled by the eare of my flesh, may penetrate euen vnto the marrow of my spirit, and there worke such holesome effects, that thy word returne not againe in vaine.
            Uouchsafe, I say, O Lord, y• this seed which at this time falleth on me, be not choked with the thornie cares of this world, neither wither through drought and defect of the deaw of the holy Ghost, in the time of tribulation, neither be deuoured by the birds of the aire: but warmed by the heate and operation of the holy Spirit, may flourish in a fruitful mould, and bring forth the fruits of eternall life: that I may know thee, loue thee, and laud thee with perpetual praise, who art laudable and glorious for euer.
            Amen.
         
         
            
            A prayer after the Sermon.
            LOrd Iesus Christ, eternall Sauiour, I giue thee thanks for that thou hast fed me wi

               h the food of thy word,

                abundantly nourished me: I beseech thee yt the vnderstanding of thy word be effectuall and healthfull to mee, that the same celestiall seede do not perish in me without fruit. Keepe my heart, and enclose it with the sence of thy grace, and prohibite that the infernall foule do not plucke it out of my heart, but prepare it vnto thee, that it may keepe thy word, and as a new thing, be infixed in my memorie. Thou art he that saidst by thy Prophet, The word that shall issue from my mouth, shall 
               Esay 55. 
               not returne to me in vaine, but shall prosper in that for which I send it. Goe to Lord, and let thy word heard by me, from the mouth of thy minister, prosper in me: giue me strength, y• my life may bee answerable to the doctrine I haue receiued. Giue increase to thy word, O thou celestial husbandman, that it may augment

and increase in me, that by thy holy word it may not onely bring me to the knowledge of thy will, but also that I may fulfill and execute that which thou biddest and wilt, and so I may perseuer vnto the end, vntil I may attaine to thy celestiall and euerlasting kingdome.
            Amen.
         
         
            When we goe about any worke.
            VVE, that are thrust into the most obscurest darkenesse through the fal of our first parents, O thou fountaine of eternall wisedome, know not what is pleasing or displeasant to thee, and what is expedient or hurtfull for vs: notwithstanding, O bountifull & mercifull Lord, I, notwithstanding y• labour bee great, if I respect my strength: light & easie, if I regard thy assistance, doe now vndertake the same, not knowing whether thou wilt that the same should bee done by me, or likewise whether it shall be profitable or hurtfull vnto me: O thou light of diuine maiesty, O beauty of the glory of the Father,

O giuer of gifts, I beseech thee, let the drops of thy grace fall vpon me, that herein I may know thy will.
            To thee therefore, O thou that dwellest in the highest, God and Father omnipotent, with humble heart, godly affection, and deuout praier, doe I fly, crauing thy helpe and assistance in beginning this worke For thou vnderstandest the depth of my ignorance, my pouerty in vertues, my sluggishnesse in weldoing, and the great deformity of my maners: all which make me vnworthy to finish such a wor

Strengthen me, O Lord God of Israel, and at this houre behold y• workes of my hands: Giue mee strength, assist and helpe mee, that the euill spirit do not hinder me in atchieuing this worke, or the detractious of wicked men reuoke me from the same: let mee faile other waies, or let me fall before the end of the worke, but vnder such a

moderator and rector, let me institute and end all things orderly, namely Iesus Christ the mediator, who is God to bee praised for euer.
            Amen.
         
         
            A thanksgiuing when the worke is finished.
            O Most sweete Lord Iesus Christ, thou redeemer of mankinde, who art Alpha and Omega, the beginning and end, by whom al things are made, & without whom nothing is done, who weighest vowes, crownest merits, and giuest rewards: I giue thee thanks, that I haue ended the work begun by thy prouidence, and ended by thy assistance. Thine it is, O good Iesus, at this present, to weigh the value therof: If I haue any waies defaulted therein, all that is mine: and if any thing hath beene gracious in the eies of thy Maiesty, all yt do I ascribe vnto thee. For being conceiued in sin, borne in sin, & bred vp in sin, what other thing can wee doe but sinne? And how

can we performe any good thing, except thou giue it, O Lord? It remaineth now, O God, that by the same mercy wherewith thou wroughtest this worke with me, by the same now thou wilt direct it to a wished scope and end, lest the fruits thereof doe perish, either to my selfe, or to my neighbour.
            And if for al those benefits which thou hast bestowed on vs, wee should giue thee thankes, most bountiful Iesus, all our whole life should bee spent in that one thing; so that it behooued vs to think on no other thing but the same. But now our duety calleth vs hencefoorth to another thing: our vocation exacteth another thing at our hands: yet are thy new benefits alwaies to bee receiued with a new giuing of thanks. For which cause I also, for that it hath pleased thee so faithfully to finish this worke in me, and by me, although thy vile & vnworthy instrument, I blesse thee and praise thee, and glorifie thee.
            But grant me also (O Lord) not onely to giue thee thankes, but also to haue them, that is, to remember

continually thy bounties, imploied on mee; that when as thou findest mee not ingratefull, thou maiest continue the increase of thy gifts in me, vntil by these of thine I may attaine the perpetual fountaine of all goodnesse and blessednesse.
            Amen
         
         
            When we prepare ourselues to studie.
            VVE, whatsoeuer we be, by a hidden instinct of nature, desire knowledge; but in so palpable darkenesse are wee conuersant, that not onely wee are ignorant of those things which wee ought to know, but also how wee ought to know. For it is the punishment of the first sinne, that this naturall light, wherewith in the state of innocency our vnderstanding was illuminate, is now extinct, and we, as it were blinde, grope for the wall, and as it were without eies, handle it.
            To thee therefore, O Wisdome, dwelling in the highest heauens & residēt in the fathers bosome, make

I recourse: enlighten (I beseech thee) my nunde, & giue mee an vnderstanding heart, y• I may know the truth, which thou thy selfe art, follow and take hold of it. Uerily I desire to know, because I haue read, that thou repulsest those that repine at Sciences: I haue read that they that are learned shal shine like the brightnes of the firmament, and they that instruct many in the waies of iustice, shall bee as a star in the perpetuities of eternities.
            But because I know not how I ought to know, I beseech thee shew me the meanes & order: grant that I may first learne y• which is most conuenient to saluation, and that most ardently, that vrgeth most vehemently to loue. Grant that I may not desire to know for vaine glory sake, not for curiositie, nor in respect of profite, but onely for the edification both of my selfe and of my neighbour.
            O thou Creator of all things, thou meridian light, O the reward of the elect, thou knowest the depth of mine ignorance, my vnpolisht

speech, my defect of vertues, and my fluggishnesse in apprehending good and ghostly things, is not hidden from thee. Notwithstanding, O vncreated Wisdome, which at thine owne pleasure, of the wicked makest iust, and of the ignorant, suddainly and without delay learned: send from the seate of thy Maiestie, thy light and thy truth, that may illuminate my darknesse, and giue mee (the vnworthy) the vnderstanding of thy chaste and holy word. Make me wiser & better, that I may impart to others likewise, part of that light which thou impartest vnto mee.
            I atribute nothing to mine industry, cūning, or wit, (for I know that all those who are rightly wise, are wise by thy teaching) but from thee I expect that thou shouldest open vnto mee the treasures of thy wisedome.
            Be assistant, bee assistant therefore, O thou brightnesse of diuine Maiestie, O beauty of thy Fathers glory, O giuer of rewards, be assistant I beseech thee, vnto me, and from the height of

thy throne, powre the sparkling light of thy grace into the heart of thy seruant, that being solely taught inwardly by thee, I may vnderstand not that which the prudence of the flesh perswadeth, but that which thy celestiall wisedome doth allow: that I may vnderstand also with sobrietie, and not whilst I perswade others to goodnesse, make my selfe arrogant and euill: but that I may first of all conuert to mine owne profit, whatsoeuer is giuen mee by thee: then from mee let it redound to my neighbour, that by ye benefite of this imperfect science, I may at last come to the contemplation of the most perfect wisedome, which thou thy selfe art: Who liuest and reignest GOD world without end.
            Amen.
         
         
            When the clocke striketh.
            BLessed bee the houre in which my Lord Iesus Christ was borne & died for vs: O Lord haue

me in remembrance at the houre of my death.
         
         
            A praier before repast.
            IT is y• admirable mystery of thy work, O thou Maker and ruler of the world, that thou sustainest by these meates the liues of men and of beasts: Truly that power is neither in the bread nor meate, but it is in thy will and word, by which all things liue and haue their beeing. And how great is that likewise that euery yeare thou so prouidest, whereby so many sorts of liuing creatures are sufficiently satisfied? Which thy holy Prophet testified in the publishing of thy praises: That all things looke vp Psal. 145. vnto thee, that thou mightest giue thē meat in due season. Thou openest thy hand, & fillest with thy blessing euery liuing creature. These are the wonderfull workes of thy omnipotencie; wee beseech thee thou Prince & magnificent father, that as thou ministrest life vnto our bodies, by meates, and by thy

word: so also it might please thee to quicken our soules with grace, by the same word. Grant that thy helpe may be present with vs, lest wee wickedly abuse those things which thou hast created for our good vses: let vs not loue thee because thou giuest those things, but let vs loue those things because they come from thee, & for a time are necessary vnto vs, returning vnto thee.
            Let vs conuerse soberly, purely, moderately, holily amongst thy gifts which thou giuest vs, lest wre conuert those things which thou giuest vs, as a medicine of our life, to the venome and death of our soules. But rather duely and thankefully receiuing them, they may become holsome both to our soules and bodies, that we may be worthy that thou like a good Father shouldest deseruedly nourish vs like thy deare children with holsome nourishment, till we obtaine to that perfection of thy Son Iesus Christ, in which this mortall shall out on immortality: neither any more want nouriture,

beeing made one with thy selfe: who art blessed for euer and euer.
            Amen.
         
         
            A praier after meate.
            VVE feele a double eating (O boūtiful & liberal Father) in our members: by this the naturall heate daily consumeth somewhat of the substāce of our bodies: by that, not the natural, but the noxious concupiscence consumeth somewhat of that iustice which by thy larges is infused into our soules. If yu repairest not, and daily strengthenest not our body with corporall meats, it dieth: and that naturall life which is in it is extinguished: & except thou daily nourish our soule by thy grace, it is first weakned, and at length dieth, not a temporall, but an eternall death.
            For as we consist of two-fold substance, so haue wee neede of a double aliment. We pray thee therfore (O Lord God) to giue our bodies our daily bread; wee beseech thee also impart to our soules thy continuall grace: by the one the

bodie is strengthened: by the other the soule is inriched: by this wee liue, by that we liue happily. Now hast thou nourished (O most gracious father) the corporall life of thy children with corporall meates: we pray thee that with the same beneficence, thou wilt now also nourish in vs the spirituall life with the crummes of thy mercy falling from thy table, that by thy grace thou maiest driue away the death of our soules. Truly we are much indebted vnto thee for this present life: and because thou prolongest the same by thy bounty, wee giue & yeeld thee most humble thankes: but this now is the way to that eternall life, which wee beseech thee by the death of thine only begotten Sonne, to bestow vpon vs by thy bounty and immortall blessednesse. Here, but for a temporall life wee giue thee thanks, but temporarie, & such as we may: there, for eternall graces shall we giue thee eternall thanksgiuing. For there shall we truly be satisfied when thy glory Psal. 36. shall appeare, which thou shalt giue vs through Iesus Christ thy

Sonne: who with thee and the holy Ghost liueth and reigneth world without end.
            Amen.
         
         
            A praier to almightie God about Sunne setting.
            O Lord, the way of the iust shineth like a cleere light, and increaseth Prou. 4. euen vnto the perfect day of eternity, but the wicked knewe not, neither vnderstood: they walk Psal. 81. in darknes, they shall descend from the interior darknes of the mind to the exterior darkenesse of hell. O therefore most miserable are they, & foure-times more miserable are they to whom that thy sunne doth set, that sun I say, yt to thy saints neuer setteth, but is alwaies meridian, cleere & shining. A grieuous night also in the noonestead attendeth their minds, who depart from thee. They expect the light, and beholde Esay, 59. darkenesse: the light, and they walke in darknes: they feele like the blinde for the wall, & grope as it were without eies: they stumble at noone day as it were in the

darke, and in obscuritie like the dead: but they that are conuersant with thee, the day is neuer darkenesse vnto them, but shineth clearely. Heere the etheriall Sun keepeth his course, ariseth, setteth, draweth neare vs, and departeth from vs: But thou (O Lord) if we truely loue thee, hast no changes: thou risest alwaies, and settest neuer: thou commest to vs, and remainest with vs to the Math, 28. worlds end. O thou that risest from the highest, lighten mee that fit in darkenesse, and in the shadow of death: O light of the Father, Luk. 1. O eternall Sonne, illumine my inward darknesse, lest after this life, I be drawne to the exteriour. O mercifull, and sweete Iesu, remaine with mee, because it wareth darke, and the day is already at an end: for as long as wee enioy thy presence, wee abide in light and clearenes, but if thou shalt depart from vs, what thing can bee pleasant, nay, what not heauy and dolesome vnto vs? When wee haue thee present wee are fedde by thy sweetnesse, we enioy thy familiaritie,

we rest in thine armes, wee are delighted by thy inward conference, wee are freed from earthly cares and desires, wee esteeme thee for our chiefest good, with thee wee dwell, with thee we liue. All these benefits die vnto vs, if thou, O eternall light, bee hidden from vs. Abide therefore with vs, O Lord, and remoue from vs the weight of our sinnes, to the end that perpetuall day may shine in our hearts: stay with vs, O Lord.
            Amen.
         
         
            An Euening confession.
            I Confesse my sinnes vnto thee eternall Bishop, minister of the Saints, and the Priest of the true taberna
                  •…
               le, who ence in the yeare of this world, hast entred into the sacred Secret, and giuen the holy and immaculate Lambe of thy body for a sacrifice for our sinnes: To thee I confesse, that I am inindebted, not onely in ten thousand talents of my sins, but that I am bound to yeeld thee account of my

whole life. Because I know that there is not one Commandement of thine, in my whole life that I haue perfectly obserued, wherein either in word, sight, hearing, taste, worke, thought, perswasion, or consent, I haue not offended. But now (O Lord) I come before thy face in confession, and in the presence of all thine Angels and holy Saints: I 
                  〈◊〉
                vnto thee all my sins, wherwith this day I haue offended thee: Here if there bee any more grieuous sins, let them be repeated. Neither these alone do I confesse, but also all other my misdeeds, whatsoeuer I haue cōmitted from my infancy hitherto, euen vnto this present houre either wittingly or ignorantly, in deeds, in words, in thoughts, and in omissions, discouering also in particular the euilltree of my heart, with all his roots, twigs, leaues, fruits, & with al his deformities, swellings, rottennes, all which are very well knowne vnto thee: for thou beholdest not onely the interior desires, doubts, & denials of thy prouidence, but also these grosse externall

offences, which we wretchedly commit in our words and deeds.
            Wherefore (O most mercifull Father) according to the measure of my weakenesse, I beseech thee (although I am altogether vnapt to pray) forgiue my offences, pardon my sinnes, and forget all the multitude of my misdeeds, as well those that I haue committed this day, as also those which thou knowest me guilty of from my infancie hitherto. Circumcise likewise, for thy goodnesse sake, my very stony heart: for this old one, create in mee a new, and endue it with a new spirit: water it with the iuice of celestiall grace, and the spirituall fountaine of waters, whereby the internal venome, and corrupt iuice of the flesh may bee dried vp, the custome of the old man may bee changed, and my heart may not heereafter bring foorth brambles and thornes, as fewell to the fire, but spirituall fruits in iustice and holinesse.
            Amen.
         
         
            
            A thanksgiuing in the euening.
            BEhold (O Lord) so many and so mighty are my sins whereby I haue this day offended thy diuine Maiesty: and that time thou gauest me to shew the fruits of repentance in, I haue consumed so vnprofitably, forgetting that this day might haue bene the very last day of my life: heaping new sinnes vpon old, and walking in thy sight (who continually seest all things) without any feare, no otherwise than if it were in the presence of some idoll: for which cause I deserued that the earth should gape, and hell should swallow me vp: but for that this most fatal punishment doth not affect me, both with lips, and heart, & all the members about me, and the power that is in me, I giue thanks to thine infinit mercy.
            For thou (O Lord) hast kept me this day by thy ciemency from all misfortune of body and soule: for

there is no euill in the world, either corporall, or spirituall, that this day might not haue happened vnto mee. For that which might befall another man, why might it not light vpon mee? For if hee bee the sonne of Adam, why, so am I: If hee bee subiect to actuall sinne, so am I: If his body bee formed of humours, and contrarie elements, so is mine. If therefore hee bee this day made blinde, why might not I also haue bene blinded? If another man this day become lame, bee consumed, fall sicke of the p

               e, why am not I partner of the same miserie? If this man hath perished by water, that by fire, hee bee extinguished by suddaine and vnexpected death, why am not I also, who am in the same state of damnation with him? Why, O Lord? why (I say?) but for that thy grace (O most pitiful Lord) hath conserued me, and thy mercy protected me, that therefore I am in safetie;

that I am whole and strong in body, I onely ascribe it to thee, & to thee giue I most intire thāks. The like, or rather more greater thanks offer I vp vnto thee (O Father) ye thou hast no lesse protected my soule from sins, then my body from sicknesses and misfortunes of this day: that being blinde, thou hast lightened her, & guided her in this way of thy commandements: that falling, thou hast raised her: that standing, thou hast sustained her from falling. For that thy mercie hath preue nied me, deliuering mee from all euils, sauing me frō those that are past, raising me from the present, and defending me from the future: taking away also the nets of my sinnes from before mee, and cutting off their occasions and causes. For except thou hadst done this, and that for me, I had done al the sinnes of the world, because I know (O Lord) that there is no sin that euer man did, that another man might not haue done, if the Creator be wanting, by whom man is made. But that I did not offēd, 
                  〈◊〉
                was thy fauour: yt I abstained,

it was thy command: and that I beleeued thee, it was thy grace inspired into me. For thou (O Lord) didst rule me to thy selfe: & kepst me for thee and my selfe and that I should not commit adulterie, or any other sinne, thou gauest mee that grace & light through Iesus Christ thy son. To thee bee praise, to thee grace, to thee glorie, for euer and euer.
            Amen.

senses and cogitations, and ordaine and direct all that which I doe, and wherein I end according to thy will, lest ingaged in the depraued darkenesse of this world & being ouercome by the Prince of the same the diuell, I bee brought into temptation, and pernicious snares: but perfect in mee true tranquillitie, and constant puritie in my conscience.

            Three most deuout praiers to excite the soule to contrition and griefe sor sinne.
            
            
               The first Praier.
               OOnly begotten Son of God, great and vnspeakable are y• benefits, O Lord, which I haue receiued at thy hands: thou framedst mee of the dust and dirt of the earth, and createdst my soule of nothing, to thy image & similitude, and madest it capable of thy glory: thou gauest mee vnderstanding, memo will, election, with

all my members and senses, and with them the knowledge and loue of thee. Thou keptst mee in the secret celles of my mothers womb, lest in them I should bee choaked without baptisme. Thou sustainedst mee patiently after so many sins, euen vnto this present day, where in the meane space there are many others who haue lesse offended than 
                     〈◊〉
                   & yet because yu wouldst not hitherto expect them, they are now perhaps tormented in hell. But besides all this, it was thy pleasure to take flesh vpon thee & to conuerse amongst men for my sake, to bee afflicted & troubled for me; to be bedewed wt bloudy sweate; to bee taken, bound, buffeted, spit vpon, mockt, blasphemed; to be clothed in a white and purple garmēt like a foole: to be strooken with a reede, to be blinded, condemned to death, & led to the place of executiō, hauing on thy shoulders the croūe to which thou wert affixed with nailes, and hanged betwixt two theeues, and adiudged for a malefactor: thou didst drinke gall and vineger: finally, thou wert slaine

with most cruel death. By so many labours and dolors (O my God) thou didst redeeme mee, and yet I most vile and peruerse sinner, ingrateful for so many benefits, haue so oftentimes newly strooken thee againe, & nailed thee to the crosse by my sins: for which cause I am worthy that all creatures should rise vp against me, & take reuenge of this my so great iniurie.
               What should I say of y• abuse of thy sacraments & medicines, which by thy precious bloud, thou institutedst & obtainedst for me? Thou tookest mee for thine in the sacrament of baptisme, there thou adoptedst me for thy sonne, and consecratedst mee as it were thy temple, there didst thou annoint me for thy Priest, King, and Champion, who was to wage combat with the enemy: there diddest thou espouse my soule, and gauest me al the honors which were answerable to this dig nity. But how haue I vsed al these benefits and ornaments which I haue receiued from thee? what cogitatiōs had I of keeping these riches? Thou tookest me for thy son,

and I may become the seruant of sinne. Thou sanctifiedst me for thy temple, and I made my selfe the habitation of diuels. Thou armedst me like a generous souldier, and I reuolted and fled vnto thine enemies. Thou madest me a king, and I waxed proud in the kingdome which thou gauest me. Thou espousedst my soule to thee in perpetuall charitie, and I more loued vanity than verity: more the creatures, than my Creator. Truly it were rightfull, yea most iust, (O Lord) that yet now at length I should begin to weepe, complaine, and lament, when I haue committed so many and so enormous sinnes.
               This is it that so long time thou expectedst from mee, as thou hast giuen me life: For so oftentimes hast thou called mee, and so long hast thou sustained mee, strooke mee, and againe flattered mee, and hast sought all waies and meanes that thou mightest reclaime mee vnto thee: thou hast expected mee, and I haue abused thy patience: thou hast called mee, and I haue

stopt mine eares against thy counsels. Thou gauest mee time for repentance, and I consumed y• same in my pride: thou strookest me, and I felt it not: thou afflictedst mee, & I would not take thy correction: thou sweatedst that thou mightest clense mee, and I am not washed: thou prouedst mee by fire, and the rust of my sins is not clensed away. I am hardned as well by thy scourges, as thy allurements: ingratful to these: rebellious against those. Notwithstanding (O Lord God) though thou hast suffered so many and so great things for mee, thou hast commanded me that I should not despaire, nor distrust in thy mercie: I conuert my selfe therefore wholy vnto thy mercy, and beseech thee to giue mee grace, that I may amend my selfe, whereby I may so heereafter please thee and serue thee, that I neuer hereafter reuolt from thee, but cleaue alwaies to thee for euer and euer.
               Amen.
            
            
               
               
                  For contrition. The second praier.
               O Supreme Maker of al liuing creatures, when I bethink my selfe how greatly I haue offended thy diuine maiesty by my sinnes, I quake for feare, and detest my vndecent madnes: considering how bountifull and reuerend a Father I haue forsooke: I curse my ingratitude, when I consider from how noble a liberty I am fallen, into most miserable seruitude: I accuse my inconstancy, & know not what to set before mine eies, but iudgement and hell: for thy iustice from which I cannot flie, terrifieth my conscience.
               On y• other side, when I behold thy vnmeasurable mercy, which according to the testimonie of thy Psal. 144. Prophet surpasseth al thy works, presently a pleasing breath of hope doth refresh mee, and strengthneth my too feeble mind. For as before I despaired, so here do I finde remission

of my sinnes in him, who by the writing of his Prophets so oftentimes inuiteth sinners to repentance, saying, I wil not y• death Ezech. 18. of a sinner, but rather that he conuert and liue. Thy onely begotten Son likewise declareth by many similitudes how ready thou art to pardon those that are penitent. That expressed he by the lost penny, by the lost sheep, brought home on the shoulders of his pastor: but especially by the prodigall sonne, Luke 15. whose image I acknowledg in my selfe. For I am he that haue indeed forsaken my most louing Father: I haue spent all my substance: and obeying the appetites of my flesh, haue fled the obedience of thy commandements, and haue fallen into the most filthy captiuity of sin: now am I trauelled with extreme necessity, from which who shall deliuer me, I truly know not, except it be he whom I haue forsaken.
               Receiue me therefore (O Lord) thy most hūble seruant, submissiuely seeking pardō at thy hands, into thy fauor. But wheras (though in vaine) thou hast euen vnto this

houre so bountifully expected mee, I confesse that I am not worthy to lift vp mine eies to heauen, or to call thee Father: yet because thou art my true Father, vouchsaf with thy fatherly eies to behold me: for thy aspect alone quickeneth the dead, and draweth all such as run astray, vnto thee. For this, whatsoeuer repētance which I now haue, I could not haue had, except thou hadst beheld me.
               When as wandring I forsooke thee, thou lookedst vpon mee from the highest heauens, where I was furthest from thee: and didst open mine eies that I might behold thee and search my conscience, and behold my selfe ouerwhelmed with so much wickednesse. Come therefore (O Lord) to receiue me: giue mee the knowledge and memory of my lost innocencie: I require not thy imbracings, nor thy kisses: I pray thee not to giue mee that goodly garment y• I was wont to weare, nor the ring of my ancient dignity: I require not that thou shouldest receiue me into the state and dignity of thy children: but it shall

suffice mee if I may bee numbred amongst the mercenary seruants of thy house, sealed with thy mark, and tied with thy bonds, lest euer heereafter I run away from thee: It shal not grieue me, although in this life I bee one of the most contemptible slaues of thy house, so that thou separate me not for euer from thee.
               Heare me therefore, most mercifull Father, and giue me the grace of thy onely begotten Sonne: and communicate with mee the merits of his passion. Giue me thy Spirit that it may purifie my heart, and strengthen it in thy grace, lest hereafter I returne again, through ignorance, into that exile, from whence thy grace hath recalled me: who liuest & reignest world without end.
               Amen.
            
            
               
                  For contrition. The third most zealous praier.

               All these (although in themselues they be great, yea weiny al) yet are they little in respect of thy greatnes. But because thou hadst these things gratis, and bought by no great price, thou wouldest giue mee another thing which cost thee more decre, that I might thereby bee the more indebted vnto thee.

                  , which in this one are contained, I might loue him that did so great things for mee, and bestowed so much loue on me.
               Behold (O Lord) thou redeemedst me: but what had that profited me, except I had beene baptized? Amongst such a multitude of infidels, scattered vpon the face of the whole earth, it pleased thee to reckon mee among the number of thy faithful: and of those to whō so happie a lot befell, as to bee thy children, regenerated by the water of holy baptisme: there was I takē for thine: there was that famous & admirable contract or couenant concluded, namely that I should be thine, & thou shouldest bee mine:

thou my Lord, and I thy seruant: thou my Father, & I thy son: where we meete together, yu to performe towards me the office of a Father, & I to serue thee with the duty of a son. What shall I say of the other Sacramēt, which thou institutedst as a remedy for my sinnes, making thy precious bloud a medicine for my wounds?
               Hauing all these helps and furtherances, as yet I continued not in goodnes, but such was my malice, that notwithstanding these I lost once more my first innocencie: and so great again was thy mercy, y• hast hitherto patiently suffred mee in my sins O my hope and my redeemer, how cā I without tears remember how often thou mightst haue slaine me, and no euill happened vnto me? how many thousand of soules haply doe now burne in hell, which haue sinned lesse then I haue sind, & yet burn not? what had become of mee if at that time thou tookest them away, thou hadst likewise taken me? how strict a iudgement had bene prepared for mee, if iustice had apprehended me beeing

guilty of so many grieuous sins? Who then (O Lord) bound the hands of thy iustice? Who praied for me when I slept? who staied y• scourge of thy wrath, when I prouoked the same by my sins? What was there pleasing in me, why yu shouldest deale more fauourably with mee than with them, who in y• midst of their perils, yea in the very heate of their youth, were taken hence? My sinnes cried vnto thee, and thou stoppedst thine eares lest thou shouldst heare them: my malice against thee increased daily, and thy mercie likewise towards me increased daily: I sinned, and thou didst expect mee: I fled thee, & thou followedst me: I was wearied in offending thee, thou wert not weary in expecting mee, in no other sort, than if my sinnes had beene fauours, and no offences. In the midst of my sinnes, I receiued many good inspirations, & many holy reprehensions frō thee, which did cenuict and condemne the dissolutenesse of my life. How often didst thou cal me, and inwardly inuite me, saying, Thou hast cōmitted Hierem.

How often hast thou terrified me with feare and threatnings, reducing to my memory the perill of my death, and the rigor of thy diuine iustice? How many orders of Preachers & Confessors hast thou appointed, that by their words and counsels might incite me & helpe me (O Lord) walking in thy way? How often hast thou folowed me by thy words, inuiting me by thy benefits, and chastising me with thy scourges, stopping vp all the waies after the manner of a hunter, that I might no way fly or escape from thee?

eares open to all follies and falsehoods. I haue diuerted the most noble part of my soule, which had eies to behold thee, from thy beauty, and conuerted them to the flourishes of this miserable life: the soule, that day and night should haue meditated on thy commandements, now night and day studieth in what maner it may offend thee. The vnderstanding so depraued, what should the will doe? Thou, my God, hadst inuited it to celestiall delights: but she preferred earth before heauen, stretching her armes, to thee (O Lord) consecrated, to the filthie affection of Creatures. This is y• recompence (O God) this the fruit which my senses (which thou createdst) brought foorth. Ah wretch that I am, what can I answer, if thou enterest into iudgement with me, and saist vnto mee, I haue planted thee an elected 
                     〈◊〉
                  , all true seed?
               And if I cannot giue answer to this first question, how shall I answer thee in the second, for my benefite of conseruation? Thou, my

Lord, thy prouidence hath conserued him that meditated on nothing else but how he might transgresse thy commandements: how persecute thy seruants: how offend thy Church: and how to strengthē the kingdome of sin against thee. Thou moouedst the tongue that biasphemed thee: thou ruledst the members which offended thee: and gauest them sustenance, who lay in wait for thy seruants: so that I haue not onely bene vngrateful for thy benefits, but also haue conuerted the benefits themselues into armes, with which I impugned thee. Thou hadst made all Creatures for my vse, that I, allured by that benefite, should loue thee: and I haue adulterated them, in that I haue so often time offended thee by them. I rather made choise of the gift, than the giuer: and from whom the occasion of knowing thy bounty was to bee taken, from them I was blinded: neither lifted I vp mine eies, yt I might see how farre more faire the Creator was thā the creature. Thou gauest me all things, that I might giue my

selfe vnto thee, & all things might serue me, but I neuer either gaue thee glory, or the tribute which is due vnto thee. Thy creatures were alwaies ready at my command (for so thou ordainedst them:) but I haue alwaies studied to offend thee: and to this end haue vsed and abused all things. Thou gauest me health, and the diuell hath gathered the fruite thereof: thou gauest me strength, and I haue imploied the same in the seruice of thine enemie. What shall I say? why were not so many kinds of calamities and miseries, which euery where I beheld in other men, sufficient that but in them I might vnderstand, but that all other mens euils were my benefits? for from all them hast thou deliuered mee. Shall it therefore bee lawfull for any man to shew himselfe vngratefull for a benefite receiued? and who is hee that oweth not thanks for a benefite receiued? If the rage of Lyons and Serpents bee lenified by gifts, why (O Lord,) shall not thine bee sufficient to mortifie and mollifie mee?

that yet at the least sometime I may say, Let vs (care our Lord God, that giueth vs tunely and euening rame in due time, & pientie of annual increase to those that loue him.

How I haue peruerted thy commandements? how I haue violated the mystery of thy incarnation? Thou becamest man, that thou mightest make me God: & I, besotted with mine owne abiectnesse, made my selfe a beast, and the sonne of the diuell. Thou descendedst on the earth, that thou mightest bring me to heauen: and I vnworthy su

                  hou raisedst me vp, and I re-embraced death: thou hadst incorporated me in thy selfe, & I again tooke party with the diuell. So many & so great blessings had not that power ouer mee, to make mee acknowledge thee: neither so many arguments of loue to make me loue thee againe: neither so many merits to make mee hope in thee: neither such a iustice which shined in thy passion, to make mee feare thee: thou hast humbled mee euen vnto the dust of the earth, & I swel with pride: thou hangedst naked on the Crosse: & the whole world satisfieth not my Auarice: They buffeted thee vpon the face, who art God: if any man touch my garment, I am angry: & notwithstanding, am but a base and vile worme. What shall I say, my Sauior? Behold how great thy mercy and charitie is towards me. Thou wouldst die, to kil my sin & I, confident in the same mercy, bounty, & loue, am not afraid to sin against thee. Alas, what greater blasphemy may there be? I of thy bounty

tooke occasion of my malice: from the very same meanes which thou vsedst to kill sinne. I tooke occasiō to quicken sinne in my selfe. So, so O Lord, I haue peruerted thy counsels: from thy mercy pickt out the method and meanes of my malignity. Because y• wert so good, I thought it was lawfull for me to be euill: and because thou hadst bestowed so many benefits on mee, I supposed it lawfull for mee to doe thee so many offences & iniuries: so that I conuerted the very medicines themselues, which thou institutedst against sin, to occasions of sinne: and the sword which thou gauest me to defend my selfe with, & fight against mine enemies, the same haue I whet against my selfe to endanger my own life. Finally, thou, to the end that thou mightst rule the liuing & the dead, wouldst die, as the Apostle witnesseth, to the

flying from thy seruice, & making my selfe the bondslaue of thine enemies. O what deserued he that did those things? If the dogs eate the flesh of that Iesabel for her sin, 4. Reg. 9. how may mine remain vntouched that haue altogether done the like?
               And if the Apostle so much exaggerateth the malice of mans heart, because that from the law he tooke Rom. 7. occasion to breake the law: how much more greater shall the malice be of grace, if any man take occasion thereby to offend grace it selfe?

What therefore shal I do but cast my selfe prostrate before thy feet, and aske mercy? Whom shal I cal vpon? who shal helpe me but thou?

Acknowledge (O Lord) this lost sheep: behold I come vnto thee altogether wounded, & thou canst heale me: altogether blinde, & thou canst giue mee sight: altogether

dead, and thou canst reuiue me, altogether leprous, and thou canst clense me. Sprinkle me (O Lord) Psal. 50. with hysope, and I shall be cleane; wash me, & I shall be whiter than snow. Greater is thy mercie than my iniquitie; greater thy clemency than my malice: and thou canst remit more than I can sin. Repulse me not therefore (O Lord) repulse me not: looke not vpon the multitude of my sins, but on thine infinite mercy: who liuest & reignest, world without end.

               An oblation of all the labours and passions of Christ, for our sins.
               WHat shal I render vnto thee (O Lord) for all the benefits thou hast bestowed vpon me? with what signification of gratuity shall I recompence so many benefits? what shal I giue thee for that thy so great mercy? alasse how slenderly doe I requite the merits of so liberall and fauourable a benefactor? I was alwaies vngrateful for thy benefits, alwaies rebellious against thy commandements: I

alwaies shut vp my soule against thy inspirations, heaping offence vpon offence, and adding sinne to sinne. I confesse (O Lord) that I am not worthy to bee called thy sonne: although I acknowledge thee to be my Father. For thou art truly my Father, thou art my hope thou art the fountaine of mercy, that repulsest not sinners that flie vnto thee, but receiuest them, washest them, and feedest them. Behold therefore, my helper: see how I (the poorest of al thy creatures) come vnto thee, bringing no other thing with mee, but the grieuous burthen of my sinnes.
               I prostrate my selfe before the feete of thy mercy, humbly asking pardon. Forgiue me I beseech thee (O my firme hope) saue mee for thy infinite mercy sake.

I offer vnto thee that thirst wherewith in thy passion thou wert afflicted, and al those other tormēts which thou sustainedst for vs with a meek hart All these with thanksgiuing, do I offer vnto thee, beseeching thy immeasurable mercy, that for the merits herof, thou wilt wipe away my sins, yu wilt remit the penalty and crime, & purifie my soule from the reliques of sinne, and bring the same at length to eternall life, Sweet Iesus in satisfactiō for my sins, I offer vp vnto thee thy most

cruel dolors which thou sufferedst, when as the soldiers cruelly haled from thy body thy garment, sticking with clotted blood vnto thy flesh and bones, and renued againe al those wounds which thou hadst receiued in thy scourging: when as cast vpon the crosse, thou sufferedst thy hands and feete to be fastened with sharpe nailes to y• holy crosse, with so much violence, that al the articles and members of thy ioints were remoued from their naturall places: when as thy precious blood flowed from all thy members in no other sort than the springs from the ouerflowing fountaines.

scorned & mocked thee whilst thou praiedst for thē to thy Father. I offer vp vnto thee those horrible torments which yu sufferedst, when as thou wert altogether giuē ouer as a prey to al afflictions, tormēts and dolors: destitute of al internall or external consolation, and forsaken of God and man: and miserably affixed to a crosse betwixt heauen & earth, didst hang in y• midst of two most notorious theeues.

I offer vnto thee that most holesome bloud flowing from thy side, & inforced by ye soldiers lance. Al these things do I offer vp vnto thee, and for them giue thee most hearty thanks, humbly beseeching thee to forgiue me my sins, & to purifie my soule from al reliks of vnrighteousnes, & bring the same at length to eternall rest: where thou liuest & reignest with the Father & the holy ghost, world without end.

               How often (my most sweet lord) hast thou stood before the doore

It is infinitely to be admired at, that the elements & all creatures doe not at once rise vp against me, and reuenge the iniurie I haue offered to the vniuersall Lord of all things.

               Amen.

               A most godly praier and oblation, wherein man offereth himselfe vp vnto God, requiring, that the tyranny of his vices expelled, God hereafter may reigne in his soule, and dwell therein, and so worke in it those fruits which pertaine to newnesse of life.
               O My God, O my loue, O my hope, O all my refuge, and all my desire, O Father of mercy and God of al consolation, as oft as I cōsider with my selfe in what state I was somtime in how many dangers of perdition I haue escaped, from how many euils thou hast deliuered me, whē I was dead in my sinnes, and lay buried and couered with the stone of my inueterate custome of offending: such a hope is quickened in me, that I cannot choose but aske at thine hands (O Lord) all such things as are necessary for my saluation.
               For I am thy workmanship: thy hands haue fashioned me, O Lord

despise not therefore the worke of thy hāds. For why should I doubt that thou wilt giue mee all thy goods, that hast daigned to take on thee all my euils? I will therefore say with the Prophet: I will Psal. 30. trust in thee, O Lord, I will reioyce and be glad in thy mercie.
               But because hope is not secure without obedience, as one of thy friends saith, Offer the sacrifice of iustice, and trust in our Lord: I Psal. 4. beseech thee O most deere God, grant me that the hope of thy mercies may strengthen mee in the obedience of thy commandements, for no lesse is this obedience due vnto thee, than hope, than loue, and the other rest. Thou art my Emperor, my King, and my God, to whom Heauen, and earth, the Sea, and all that is therein do obseruance: which haue neuer broken thy lawes, but alwayes obserued thy commandements.
               Grant mee (O Lord) that with no lesse dutie than all other creatures, I may bee obedient to thy holy will, by reason I am bound vnto thee in more offices of dutie

than they are: vouchsafe, O King of Kings, that I may obey thee: and may neuer decline from the prescript of thy law. Reigne in me, O Lord, and suffer not the world, neither the Prince thereof to gouerne in mee any longer: let not the flesh hold mee captiue, neither mine owne will, but thine. Let all these tyrants, intruders vpon thy possession, theeues of thy glorie, & wret

mee lieth) resist them, I impugne as much as I am helpt I surrender to thee my God: I defend my selfe for thee, because I acknowledge my selfe to bee thine owne, I esteeme thee for my God, and my Lord, saying, I haue no other King but my God. Come therfore (O Lord) destroy them in thy strength: thou shalt rule in me, for y• art my very King and my God, who sendest saluation to Iacob. No other lawes, no other prescripts shall haue place in me, but thine: no other name, no other Scepter except thine shall be adored in me, that thy will may be done in earth as it is in heauen.
               O Lord when shall that day be, when I shall bee freed & deliuered from these tyrants? what? no other voice but thine, shall be heard in mee. When shall my heart bee cleansed? When shall the forces of mine enemies be so defeated, yt no contradiction may hinder mee in the obseruation of thy commandements? When shall the force of mine enemies be so broken, that no force may be found in me contrary

to thy law? when shall this sea bee calme? when shall this heauen wax cleere? when shall my affections bee so bridled, and my passions so subdued, so that no flouds, no clouds, no troubles may bee found in mee that may disturbe thy kingdome in me: but yt I may euery way enioy happy peace, secure tranquillitie, and obseruance of thy lawes?

Thine I say am I, vpon most iust titles: thine, becaue thou didst create me, & gauest mee that being which I enioy: thine because in this being thou hast conserued mee, and plentifully furnished mee with the benefits and offices of thy prouidence: thine, because from

thraldome thou hast set mee at libertie, not with gold or siluer, but redeeming mee with the ransome of thy most precious blood. Finally I am thine, because thou hast so often bought me, as thou hast deliuered me from any sinne.
               If therfore vpon so many groūds I am thine, & thou likewise art my King, my Redeemer and deliuerer: Behold I turne vnto thee, that I may yeeld thee that which is thine owne: that is, I yeeld my selfe vp vnto thee as a perpetuall bondmā and slaue. Behold I giue thee the keyes of my liberty, the dominion ouer my will, that hereafter I neither bee mine owne, neither any other mans, but altogether thine: that I may not liue to my selfe, but to thee: not serue my selfe but thee, so that whether I eat or drinke, or whatsoeuer I do, I may referre al things to the glory of thy name. I stay my selfe for thee, I deliuer my selfe vnto thee, that thou maist dispose of mee as of thine owne, and that according to thy good liking and pleasure: whether it please thee yt I liue, or y• I die: whether I bee

whole, or sicke: whether rich or poore: whether praised or reprooued: in all things I offer and deuote my selfe vnto thee: I resigne my selfe into thy hands: I renoūe the right & possession of my selfe, that hereafter I be not mine owne but thine, vntil that which is thine by right, may be made thine by my will, & that not once nor one day, but alwaies & euery where.
               Amen.
            
            
               The second prayer of the penitent.
               O Lord, thou that createdst me, my only God, my onely Lord, thou art my creator and my redeemer, in whom I hope, from whom I expect al those things which are requisit for my soule. Thou forsakest not those yt trust in thee: thou art my sweetest, my bountifullest, my liberalest God: thou art the father of light, from whom all good things proceede, and euery perfect gift descēdeth frō aboue vnto mee. Thou createdst me whē I was no thing: thou redeemedst me when I was created & lost: thou restoredst

vnto me the Seale of innocencie which I lost, in my first baptisine: Thou sauedst mee after I had receiued the knowledge of the truth, voluntarily sinning againe, & almost shipwrackt in the seas of this world, by the sacred anchor of true repentance: and all this of thine owne will and meere grace: for if by my good deedes I had preuented thee, where is that which thy Prophet saith, his iustice preuented Psalm. 58. mee? If I had done any good worke whereby I might deserue thy mercie, where is that of thine Apostle: Through grace you are Ephes. 2. saued by faith, and not of your selues, for it is the gift of GOD? If my loue preuented thee, how is that true, Not because wee loued him, but for that he first loued vs? 1. Iohn 4. If without thy helpe, and by our owne vertue we follow thee where is it that thine onely begotten Sonne saith, Without me can you doe nothing? and no man can come Iohn 15. Iohn 6. vnto mee except my Father draw him? All that therefore which I haue, all that which I am, it is of thy grace, thy gift, thy liberalitie

and mercie, so that but in thinking I could not preuent the gifts of thy good works by my vertue: For we are not sufficient, to thinke any thing of our selues, as of our selues, but all our sufficiencie is 2. Cor. 3. from thee.
               What therfore shall I do, wretched, naked and poore, that I am? I am weake and lame, but by thy gifts and benefits, rich and wealthy: I sailed by the sea, but a tempest arising, my ship was drowned, m

The onely remedy yt is lest me, is to beg: but who is so liberall that hee will, or so rich that hee can helpe a caitife so miserably poore, but thou onely (O God)

But how shall I restore vnto thee, O Lord, except thou first giue mee? and to whom shalt thou giue but to him that beggeth at thy hands? and who dare not aske, when as thou so liberally inuitest all men saying, Come vnto mee all Math. 11. you that labour and are burthened, and I will refresh you: come all ye that thirst vnto the waters: and those that want mony, hasten, Esay, 55. buy and eate: Come buy without money, and without any exchange, Wine and milke. Incited by this so bountifull prouocation of thine, behold I come vnto thee, and beseech thee, that thou wilt giue mee the meanes to satisfie all that which I ow thee: and namely giue mee thy grace, duely to adore thee, serue thee, praise thee, and yeeld thee that due reuerence and honour that belongeth vnto thee: that I may giue thee thankes for thy benefites, loue thee with all my heart, put all my trust in thee, obey thy commaundements, offer my selfe wholie vnto thee, commend my selfe into thy hands, and that I

may learne to aske these or such like graces from thee: that outwardly before mine eies, and inwardly within my heart, the glorie of thy Name, and the saluation of my soule, like a white or marke, may continually bee prefixt before me.
               I beseech thee also (O Lord) to graunt mee the remission of my sinnes, true contrition and pennance: giue mee grace, that I neuer hereafter offend thee, either in those sinnes, which were hitherto familiar vnto mee, or any other whatsoeuer. But especially (O LORD) I require the grace and strength at thy hands, that I may chastice my flesh, refraine my tongue, mortifie the inordinate appetites of my heart, and recollect the dispersed and wandering thoughts of my imagination: that so reformed both inwardly and outwardly, and made a new Creature, I may deserue to bee a liuing and gratefull Temple, in the which thou maist rest and make thy biding place.
               
                  
Giue mee those vertues also, wherewith that thy habitatiō may not onely bee purged, but also beautified, such as are the holie feare of thy name, firme hope, perfect humility, entire patience, prudent discretion, pouertie of spirit, exact obedience, continuall fortitude, and diligent alacritie in all those things, which appertaine to thy seruice and honour: and aboue all, ardent charitie, as wel towards thee as towards my neighbour.
               But because I know my self vnworthy of all these, and vndeseruing any of them, remember I pray thee, O Lord, thy old mercies: remember that thou desirest not the death of a sinner (as thou thy selfe testifiest) but that hee bee conuerted and liue: remember

               VVHo art thou my Lord, and who am I, that I dare ap proch thee? What is man that hee

can receiue God vnto him, his maker & Redeemer? What is man in his nature, but the vessell of corruption, and rottennes: the sonne of the diuell: the heire of hell? the worker of iniquitie? the contemner of God? and a Creature vnfit for all goodnesse: and apt and prompt to all wickednesse?
               What is man but a creature miserable in all things? in his counsel blinde; in his actions incōstant: in his appetites vncleane: in his desires vnconstant: in euery worke of his, litle: in his owne eies, great: see Lord, see what I am.

The Iohn 1. Prince of the Apostles, exclaimed saying: Depart from me (O Lord) for I am a sinfull man: & shall I yt am the notorious sinner of all men not feare to approach thee? If it were vnlawfull for any man to eat the Bread of proposition (which were onely but a shaddow of this 1. Reg. 21. profoūd mystery) except him that was clean and sanctified: how can I bee secure who eate the bread of Angels, where notwithstanding I am so farre off from all sanctite?
               
                  
That pascall Lamb which was Exod. 12. a type & figure of this sacrament, according to the commandement of God, was to bee eaten with vnleauened bread, and wild Lettuice, and they that did eate the same, ought to haue their loines girt, & their shooes vpon their feete.
               Ah, how shall I dare to come to this true Pascal Lambe, who haue none of these preparations? For what thing else is the vnleauened bread, than Purity without the leuen of malice? And what the bitter Lettuice, but vehement contrition? Where is the puritie of my reynes? where of my feete? that is, the cleannesse of my holy desires?
               I feare (O Lord) and vehemētly suspect, lest I should bee excluded from this table if any of those preparations should bee wanting in me.
               From this table was he reiected Math. 22. or rather repulsed who came without his wedding garment, that is, without charity: and being bound hand & foote, hee was cast into exterior darknesse: what other thing expect I now, if I shall intrude my

selfe to this banquet without this vesture?
               O diuine eies, to whom all the cranies & corners of my soule are open and manifest, what shall become of mee, if I present my selfe naked & boide before thy presence?
               To touch the Arke (which was only but a figure of this sacramēt) 2. Reg. 6. it was so great an offence, that Oza the priest stretching out his hand to vphold the same, being ready to fall, & supporting it, was strooken with suddain death: how can I thē choose but feare, and suspect the like penalty, if vnworthily I shall receiue that, of which the Arke was onely but a figure?

But O most merciful Lord, how much more worthy is this sacrament thā the Arke of ye Couenant: and how

much more dangerous is it to receiue thee, than to see thee?
               Not without reason therefore ought I to bee afraid and tremble as often as I come to receiue a Lord of so great maiesty & iustice. And if there be so many causes why I ought to feare thy greatnes: how many reasons should there bee of feare, if I weigh the mu

                  itude of my sinnes? For I call to remembrance O Lord many grieuous sins of mine, whereby I haue in this world offended thy diuine maiesty. The time was, somtime ther was a time (thankes bee giuen to God that the time is not now) whē I loued not that thine infinite beuty, but buried it in deepest obliuion: when the dust of thy creatures was more estimate with mee, than the treasures of thy graces, and y• hope of thy eternall glorie. The Lawes and rules of my life were my desires & inordinate appetites, I had no care of thee: I shewed thee no reuerence, because I knew thee not.
               I am that foole that said in my heart there is no God: for so dissolutely

for a time did I liue, that in my matters I did professe that I beleeued thee either to be nothing, or to be of power to do nothing. I did not labor to insinuate my selfe into thy-loue: I feared not thy iustice: I set light by the breach of thy lawes: I yeelded not that thankes which I ought although I knew thou wert present in all places, yet was I not ashamed securely in thy sight to commit sin, yea and that very grieuously.

There is not one corner in my soule which is cleane and pure, & which hath not too often times bene prophaned by diuers kinds of sinnes. I haue not a cleane and new Sepulcher in which I may hide thee. O thou my redeemer and Sauiour, I am ashamed as often as I see my selfe in this estate: I blush whē I consider in what sort I come to this thy worthy and royall banquet, in what maner I intrude my selfe to embrace my celestial spouse, who againe standeth ready to receiue me fauourably.
            
            
               Another part of this Meditation.
               I Acknowledge (O Lord) I acknowledge my great vnworthinesse, and yet thy most great mercie is not hidden from me: this it

is that maketh me bold and confident to come vnto thee, howsoeuer I am. For the more vnworthy I come vnto thee, by so much the more art thou glorified, if thou repulse mee or persecute a creature so vncleane wt thy displeasure. O Lord, thou art not wont to shake off sinners, but to call them, and conuert them vnto thee: Thou art he that saiest, Come vnto me all ye Math. 11. that labour & are laden, and I wil refresh you: And in another place, The whole haue no need of a Physition, Math. 9. but such as are sick. Of thee is it publikly said, that thou entertainedst Publicans and sinners, & didst eate with them. O my God thou hast not changed thy nature, which then thou hadst: for which cause I firmely beleeue that thou as yet dost call them from heauen, whom then thou didst call vpon the earth.
               For which cause I likewise allured by that thy fatherly summons, come vnto thee, groaning vnder the burden of my sinnes, and thou shalt vnloade me: I come laboring and ouer-charged, and thou shalt

refresh me: I come like a patient to my Physition, and thou shalt heale mee: like a sinner to the fountaine of iustice, and thou shalt iustifie mee: Thou receiuedst sinners, and eatest with them, and thy meate is to conuerse with them: and thy delight is to be with men.
               If thou take so much delight, O Lord, in such banquets, behold thou hast heere a grieuous sinner, with whom thou maiest eate thy bread. I verily beleeue, O my Redeemer, that thou tookest more delight in the teares of that publike penitent, thā in ye sumptuous feast of that proud Pharisee, for which cause thou neither despisedst her, Luke, 7. neither reiectedst her from thee as an adultresse, but rather most bountifully receiuedst her, forgauest her sinnes, defendedst her against the reproches of her calumners, & for a few drops of teares, pardonedst her many sinnes. Behold O Lord, here is a new matter of greater glory offred vnto thee, a new occasion: behold heere lieth a sinner who hath far more sinnes, and yet fewer teares: shee neither

was the first nor the last, whom thy mercie suffered: many such like things hast thou done, O Lord, and many the like as yet remaine for thee to do. Enter now, O Lord the number of them that beginne thy worke receiue him into fauor, who hath more grieuously offended thee, and that lamenteth his offences. This penitēt hath not so many teares as may wash thy feet, but thou hast shed so much blood as sufficeth not onely to cleanse mine, but also the sins of the whole world. Bee not displeased, O my God, that being such a one as thou seest I am, I dare preas
                     •…
                  e into thy presence. Remember that thou wert not displeased with y• poore womā which trauelled with a flux of blood, and secretly came vnto thee, seeking remedie of her infirmitie, and taking thee by the hemme of thy Uesture; but rather didst praise her, and comfort her, saying: Daughter bee comforted, Math. 9. thy faith hath made thee whole. Behold I y• haue a greater & more perilous flux of blood, and am lesse curable, what shall I doe? whither

shall I turne me, to whom shall I goe, but vnto thee (O LORD) that I may obtaine the benefite of health?
               My Lord, thou hast neither changed thine office, neither that custome and nature which thou wert wont to haue, when thou werst cōuersant with vs vpon the earth, although now thou art ascended into heauen, and seemest to bee farre distant from vs. For if thou hadst bene changed, wee had neede of another Scripture and Gospell that might teach vs now what wee should beleeue of thee, and what to hope from thee being now res
                     •…
                  ant in heauen.
               I reade in the holy Gospels, that such as were sick flocked vnto thee & that the whole multitude sought to touch thee, because a vertue came frō thee that healed all men: Leapers came vnto thee, and thou stretchedst thy blessed hands, and clensedst them. The blinde came Luke, 6. vnto thee, the deafe, the sicke of the palsey, they that were possessed by diuels. Finally, all the monsters of this world ranne vnto thee, and to

none of these didst thou denie thy helpe. In thee onelie is saluation, in thee is the medicine, and remedy of all euils. Thou art more readie to giue saluation, than they to aske it.
               Whither therefore shall we goe (O Lord) in our necessities but vnto thee? for I know my God, yt this Sacrament is not onely their food that are whole, but their medicine also that are sicke & weake: not only the strength of the liuing but the resurrection of the dead: it not onely recreateth and delighteth the iust, but healeth also, and purifieth sinners,
               Let euery one come hither and take part of that which he thinketh most holsome for himselfe: let the iust come and eate, and reioyce in this table, and let the voice of their confesson and praise sound in this holsome challice.
               I can no waies be without this mystery: I can no waies liue without the same: and whatsoeuer I am, I cānot be excused, if I receiue it not: for in euery place and in euery thing, it is necessary for me. If

I be sicke, here shall I be healed: if aliue, here shall I be comforted: if dead, here raised againe: if I burne with diuine loue: heere shall I bee more inflamed: if I bee but luke warme, here shall I be set on fire. I will not feare, although my LORD shall finde mee blinde, because he giueth sight vnto mee: I will not feare, although I see that I am fallen, for hee lifteth them vp that are fallen low. I will not flie from his presence as once Adam did, although I be naked, for he can couer my wickednesse: I wil not hide me, although I seeme vncleane and full of sinne, for hee is the fountaine of mercie: I will not be ashamed although I am poore: for hee is the Lord of all liuing things.
               I am not much mooued if hee shall interpret my boldnesse to bee his iniurie: but I thinke I shall giue him occasion of greater glory, that beeing more wretched than al other liuing creatures, y• greatnes of the diuine mercy may more cleerly appeare in mee in that, that he will helpe me.
               
                  
His darkenesse that was blinde from his birth, attēded on the glory of God, for he was borne blind, to the end that the works of God might bee manifested: so also the misery of my condition shall serue him, because in the same, the greatnesse of his bounty shall bee beheld, namely, if hee who is so mighty vouchsafe to succour so miserable and poore a creature, & that especially whereas heerein there is no regard had of mee, but onely for the merits of our Lord Iesus Christ: for which cause y• eternall Father giueth vs good things, & adopteth vs for his children, & taketh it in good part that th

               Another prayer before the Communion.
               I Praise thee & thanke thee, most sweet Lord Iesus my Sauior & redeemer, for thy so many benefits which thou hast vouchsafed to bestow on mee most vile and wretched sinner. I yeeld thee thankes, O Lord, for all the mercies which yu vsedst towards man-kinde, especially in the mystery of thy incarnation, namely in thy natiuitie, circumcisiō, presentation in y• temple, flight into Egypt, in thy fasting and temptation, in thy labors and many iournies, in thy preachings & persecutions in this world, in the torments and dolors of thy bitter

passion, and for al that which thou sufferedst in the flesh for me.
               But in especial I giue thee heartie thankes for thy vnspeakeable charitie, which mooued thee to suffer for my sake, which verilie amongst all thy works is the greatest without any comparison. Moreouer, I yeeld thee all thanks that is possible, for that thou daignest to admit mee to thy most holy Table, & make mee partaker of thy selfe, and all thy merits, and the inestimable treasure of the passion. O my GOD and Sauior, with what offices of dutie shall I recompence this new and vnheardof kinde of mercie? Who art thou, and who am I, that thou the Lord of most high maiestie, daignest to enter into dirt, and this earthly tabernacle? O Lord, holinesse becommeth Psal. 92. thy house for euer and euer: why therefore commest thou into my house, which is abundantly stored with iniquitie? Heauen is thy house, and thy seate, and the earth the footstoole of thy feet, because the glorie of thy maiestie filleth both heauen and earth: how

comes it therfore to passe that thou doest not abhorre to lodge in so vile an hospitall? Is it therefore to bee thought (saith Salomon) that truly God dwelleth on earth? For 3. Reg. 8. if the heauens, and the heauen of heauens bee not able to containe thee, how much lesse this house which I haue built? O admirable thing▪ hee that sitteth vpon the Cherubins, and beholdeth the depths, now humbleth himselfe euen vnto the lowest, and maketh his seate in the lowest places.
               It seemed little to thy goodnesse that thou didst appoint y• Angels to our ministerie, but thy selfe wouldest come vnto vs, & enter into our soules, that there with thine owne hands, thou mightst worke ye act of our saluation. There dost thou visit the sick, raise such as are fallen, teach the ignorant, reduce such as are straied out of the way. What need many words? Thou art he that curest our wounds, and healest our infirmities, not by an other mans hands, but thine own: not by medicines fet from afarre, but with thine owne flesh and blessed

blood, dost thou medicine vs.
               O true Pastor, how abundantly hast thou discharged thy promises which in times past thou madest by Ezech. 34 thy Prophet? saying, I wil feed my sheepe, and I will make them rest. But who shall bee worthy of this grace? who can merit this benefite? only thy mercy, O Lord, can make vs worthy of so infinite benefits. And because without the same, no man can bee worthy, O Lord, let the same bee fauourable vnto mee, let it make me partaker of so many mysteries, let it make mee thankefull for so inestimable a benefit: O Lord with thy grace supply all my defects, forgiue me all my sins thorow thy mercie. Let thy spirit prepare my minde, thy merits enrich my pouerty, & thy precious blood clense all the blemishes of my soule, and wash out all the staines of my life; that I may worthily receiue this most reuerend sacramēt. My soule reioyceth & is glad, o my God, as often as I remember that notorious miracle, wherin in time past, a dead man raised a dead body, by the only means of touching.

For if the body of a dead Prophet could do so much, what cannot the liuing bodie of the Lord of Prophets doe? I am assured O Lord, that thy power is not of lesse value than that of thy Prophet, and my soule is no lesse dead, than the body of that mā, neither is this touch of lesse efficacie than that: why therefore should I not expect the like benefit in my selfe? why should a body begotten in sinne, doe more mirecles than a body conceiued by the holy ghost? Why shall the body of the seruant haue a greater prerogatiue, than the body of the maister? Why shall not thy body raise my soule, sanctified in thy blood, which cleaueth and is ioyned vnto thee by faith, when that raiseth those bodies which it toucheth? And because this body was raised, not requesting life, but by the onelie vertue of the bones of thy blessed Prophet: let it bee pleasing to thine infinite mercie, O my God, since I request and beseech thee to giue me life by the meanes of this Sacrament, that I may not now line, but thou in mee.
               
                  
O good Iesu, by that thine inestimable charitie, which betraied thee for my sake, & made thee suffer an ignominious death; I humbly beseech thee, that thou wilt cleanse me from all sin, adorne me with all kindes of vertues, and thy merits: and grant me grace that I may receiue this holy Sacrament with so much humilitie and reuerence: so much feare and trembling: with so much griefe and repentance for my sins: finally, with so much loue and charitie, as this most heauenly mystery doth require. Grant mee most mercifull Lord that puritie of intent, whereby I may worthily ha
                     •…
                  e accesse to thy mysticke table, to the glory of thy holy name, and the remedy of my infirmities & necessities: that strengthned by the vertue of this Sacrament, I may be able strongly to withstand mine enemies, to ouercome them, and to sustaine my selfe by that liuing meate in the spirituall life. Grant also by y• benefit of this Sacramēt that I may be made one with thee, and incorporated in thee: may inseparably cleaue vnto thee, being

made one spirit with thee.
               Let this sacrifice bee my safetie, and this inestimable benefit of this Sacrament assist all men, as it is instituted for the health of them: & left vnto thy Church: who liuest & reignest world without end.
               Amen
            
            
               A most worthy meditation after the Communion.
               
                  O My God and my Sauiour, how shal I yeeld thee cōdigne thankes, for that thou beeing the King of Kings, & Lord of Lords, hast not disdained to visit my soule and to enter the poore roose of my miserable cottage: and so to worke that both thou and I are one, and that by the means of the inestimable vertue of y• Sacrament. With what reward shal I requite such a benefit? With what offices shal I remunerate thy so great goodnes? wt thanks may a miserable wretched, and poore creature giue for a gift so rich and precious? For it suffised thee not in this mystery to make vs partakers of thy supreme

deity, but thou wouldest also communicate vnto vs thy humanitie, together with all thy merits, which in the same, and with the same thou didst purchase for vs: for giuing vs thy body and blood, thou makest vs also partakers of thy holy treasure, and of all thy merits, which being on earth, thou obtainedst for vs. O admirable Communion! O treasure to be equalled by no price, and as yet vnknowne vnto men O mercifull Redeemer of our soules! with what more richer iewels, or greater riches couldest thou store vs, thā with this most blessed Sacrament? Deseruedly, O Lord, didst thou say in the praier, which thou saidest about the houre of thy passion: I sanctifie my selfe for thē, Iohn 17. that they also may bee sanctified in truth, namely after a new maner of sanctification, difficile to the sanctifier, and easie to the sanctified. For thine is the sanctity, O Lord: mine the fruit of sanctitie: thou didst labour, I receiued the reward: thou wert at the charge, I reapt ye profite: thou art chastised, & I am pardoned for my sins: thou drunkest

the bitter potion, & I with my selfe recouer my lost health: thy dolours, thy nayles, thy strokes, thy thornes, and thy precious blood, not shed by drops but by flouds, satisfied for me: thy teares wash mee, thy wounds heale me, & thy scourgings haue satisfied for me. O rich Communion! O fraternity of infinit merits! O traffique of inestimable treasure! what stocke or summe haue we imploied in this partnershippe? what haue we aduentured that the increase is so profitable vnto vs? Why doth the sun illuminate the world? why warmeth the fire the body, which is the obiect against it? why doth the water coole yt same? The reasō is manifest, for these are their naturall properties; for such creatures produce such effect: And it is thy property, O lord, to pardon; thy custom to shew mercie, and that rather to others than to thy selfe. Thy goodnesse is ours, & that not ordinary, but infinit: for as the property of good is to be cōmon & communicatiue, so truly the chiefest good should also be chiefly diffusiue: & this hast thou

done vnto vs, because thou hast wholy giuen thy selfe vnto vs. In thy birth, thou becamest our brother: in our nourishing, our food: in thy death, our redemption: in our ruling, our reward: finally, O my soule, if in one word thou wilt comprehend all these benefits, which this so admirable Sacramēt bringeth with it, consider that which this Lord brought into this world, when as becoming man he came into thy world. For when he entred into the world, he gaue the world the life of grace, with al those things which attend on the same: so also when he comes by y• Sacrament into our soule, hee giueth the same life of y• soule. O diuine food by which the sons of men are trāsformed into the sons of God, and by which the flesh is mortified in vs, that the deity may liue in vs: O sweetest bread, worthy to bee adored, nourishing the soule, not the belly: strengthning the heart, and not ouercharging the body: reioycing the spirit: & not troubling the vnderstanding: whose vertue doth moderate our appetites, killeth our

selfe will, that the will of God may be more effectuall in vs.
               What thanksgiuing therefore shal I yeeld vnto thee: what praises shal I sing vnto thee (O Lord) for this thy benefite? If the gratuitie ought to be answerable to the gift, what kinde of recompence I pray you will equall such a gift? Thou saidst in times past to thy seruant Moses: Take the golden vessel, and Exod. 16. hide it in the Arke of the couenant and it shall be kept there for future generatiōs, that they may see that meate which for forty yeares long I made you feede on in the desart. If y• so much esteemedst (O Lord) that corruptible meate which thou gauest thy people in the desart, yt thou wouldest it should be kept wt reuerence, in perpetuall remembrance of the same: in what account should that incorruptible meate be with vs, which giueth life eternall to those that eat the same? I manifestly see that there is the same difference which is betweene the one meate and the other, as betweene the one benefit and the other: and that for that cause there ought to

bee the same difference betweene the one gratuitie & the other; that meate was earthly, this heauenlie; that was of the bodie, this of the Soule: that gaue not true life to those that eat the same, this giueth eternall life to those that worthily receiue it. But why make I cōparisō betweene the one & the other? For whatsoeuer difference is betweene the creature & the Creator, the same is betweene this and that meate. If therefore thou O Lord, require such remembrance, and gratuity for that thou didst nourish thy people with corporall and corruptible meate, what wilt thou require of vs whom thou nourishest with so farre better foode as the Creator exceedeth the creature? there is not any praise nor thanksgiuing which is worthy this benefite. When as therefore I neglect mine owne forces & faculties, neither can I finde way or meanes to pay thee that which I owe thee, there is no other remedy left for me, than wt the Prophet to take yt cup of saluation, and call vpon the Psal. 115. name of our Lord: yt is, not to remunerate

yt benefits that are past, but to aske new, & to require grace vpon grace. I beseech thee therefore (O Lord) vouchsafe that I may receiue this Sacrament in satisfaction of all my sinnes, and amendment of my former life: that being repaired in me by the benefite thereof, whatsoeuer is fallen, whatsoeuer I wāt, let it be supplied: and grant that my pouerty may bee enriched by the benefits of thy graces. By yt vertue of this sacrament, mortific in me whatsoeuer is displeasant to thy diuine eies, and make me conformable to thy will. Uouch safe mee (O Lord) that by this mystery I may alwaies perseuere in thee, & may continually and perfectly loue thee, & that I may be alwaies continually vnited & coupled vnto thee, to the honour of thy holy name. Be fauourable (O Lord) vnto all my offences; and not mine onely, but all others. Grant the Heretikes & Schismatikes may returne to the vnitie of thy Church: illuminate the Infidels that they may know thee: help all those for whom I am bound to

pray Comfort my father, mother, brothers, and sisters, friends, and enemies, with all those that haue euer done me good. Bee mercifull vnto all those for whom thou sh

may bee the euacuation of my vices, extermination of my concupiscence and lust: the augmentation of my charitie and patience, humility and obedience, against the deceits of both my visible and inuisible enemies: a firme defence, a perfect pacification of my motions, both carnall and spirituall & assured cleaning to thee, the onely and true God: & a happy consummation of my life. And I beseech thee, that thou wilt conduct mee most wretched sinner, to that inestimable banquet, where thou with thy Sonne, and the holy Ghost, to thy Saints art a true light, compleat satietie, eternall ioy, consummate pleasure, and perfect felicitie, through Iesus Christ our Lord.

               The third Prayer after the Communion.
               PIerce, O most sweet Lord Iesu, yt marrow and inwards of my soule, wt the sweet and holsome wound of thy loue: with true, perfect, pure, Apostolike, and sacred charitie: that my soule may onely languish & melt away, in the loue & desire of thee: let it not long after, and grow weary in thy wayes: let it desire to be dissolued, and to be with thee. Grant that my soule may hunger after thee the bread of Angels: y• resurrection of al holy soules: our supercelestiall and daily bread: hauing in it all sweetnesse and sauour, and all delectation of suauitie. Grant that my heart may alwaies hunger & thirst after thee on whom the Angels desire to looke: and with the sweetnes of thy fauor, let the inward secrets of my soule be filled: let it alwaies thirst after thee the fountaine of life, the fountaine of wisdome and science, the fountaine of eternall light,

               Amen.
            
            
               The first prayer for the loue of God.
               
                  O Sweet, benigne louing, bounteous, deere, mighty, o admirable, ineffable, inestimable, incomparable, o powerfull, magnificent, liberall, incomprehensible,

infinite, & most mighty God. Thou art onely good, all pitifull, all amiable: thou art sweeter than hony, whiter than snow, delightfuller than all pleasure, sweeter than all delight, more precious than gold of precious stones: Thou art my God, my life, and my onely hope. Grant me (o Lord) yt I may loue thee: if not as much as thou deseruest, yet at leastwise as much as thou maiest be beloued in this life, by any man subiect to sinne, and thrall to many necessities.
               With that Leaper in the gospel, O Lord, I come before thy presence, Math. 8. crying, o Lord, if thou wilt thou canst make mee cleane: thou canst I say, clense my soule from al her sinnes, & canst purge the same, as it were gold in the fire of thy loue: if thou wilt, thou canst presently enrich this poore one: if thou wilt, thou canst make mee glad, & of all those that are in this world most blessed. What will it hinder thee, O Lord, if thou yeeld me such a blessing? what disprofite will it breede? what losse will it bring thee?
               
                  
So then, O Lord, since thou art the Ocean of infinite goodnesse, liberality and riches, why through thy wrath hidest thou thy mercies from mee? Why are my sins more mightie than thy goodnesse? Why shall my sins rather condemne me, than thy mercies saue me?
               If thou requirest contrition, & griefe for my offences, behold I con
                     •…
                  eiue so much sorrow for my sinnes, that I had rather haue endured a thousand sorts of death, then once to haue offended thee. If thou requirest satisfactiō, loe I offer my bodie vnto thee, powre thy wrath vpon it: exercise what torments of thy displeasure thou 
                     〈◊〉
                   vpon it, so thou denie mee not thy mercie.
               Grant therfore that I may loue thee, my God, my strength, my refresher, my redeemer, my helper and my hope: I onely seeke thee, I onely desire thee, I onely crie vnto thee, my Lord God: thou art

besides thee is but pouerty: whatsoeuer is in any place without thee, is but troubled and salt water vnto mee: it cooleth not my thirst, but kindleth it. I onely seeke thee, I onely will thee, I onely desire to behold thy face, I pray vnto thee, beseeching thee not to separate thy mercy and loue from me.
               I will possesse thee, and will not let thee goe before thou hast blessed me: I will cleane vnto thee, and will not depart from thee before thou hast brought mee into thy Winecellar, and ordered me in thy Cant. 2. charity. I will cry after thee, neither will I hold my peace: I will say with the Prophet, I will loue Psal. 17. thee O Lord my strength, I will meditate vpon thee without ceassing, I will thinke on thee, in my sleepe in the night time: for I am in health when I am with thee, and sicke if I be from thee, for thou onely canst blesse my soule, thou art my God and my Lord, for euer and euer.
               Amen.
            
            
               
               A second prayer for the loue of God.
               
                  O Good Jesu! O the sweetnes of my hart, O y• life and saluation of my soule, when, in all, and through all things shall I please thee? When shall I perfectly die vnto my selfe? When shall I prefer thee before all other creatures? when shall nothing liue in mee but thy selfe? Haue mercy vpon me, O Lord, and helpe mee. I salute thy wounds, O Lord, like vernall roses: hide me O Lord, in them, and wash mee in y• same, y• euery way I may bee cleane, and inflamed wt thy loue. O Lord my God O admirable beginning, O piety of amiable charity, O clearest light of my vnderstanding, O repose of my will, when shall I ardently loue thee? vouchsaf o Lord, to pierce my soule wt y• dart of thy loue, vouchsafe to associate me wt thy selfe, that I may bee made one with thee. O my desire, O my hope, O my reliefe: Oh if my soule were woorthie of thy imbracings, that all slownesse and

lukewarmnesse were consumed in mee by the fire of thy loue. O the soule of my soule, O the life of my life: I wholy desire thee, & wholie offer my selfe vnto thee, one to one & onely to thee onely. O if that had place in mee which thou saidst to thy Father: Blessed Father, let thē 
                  Iohn 17. be one as we are one: I in them & they in mee, that they may bee consummate in one.
               I wil no other thing, I desire no other thing, I expostulate no other thing at thy hands, for thou onely suffisest me: Thou art my Father, thou art my mother, thou art my defender, thou art my guider, thou art al my good: thou art altogether amiable, wholy delectable, onelie faithful. Who was euer so liberal, as to forsake himselfe? who euer so tenderly loued, as to yeeld himselfe into y• hands of so bitter death for so vile a creature? Who so humble, that so much diminished and humbled his maiesty? o Lord thou despisest no man, thou disdainest no man▪ thou repulsest no mā that seeketh thee, nay rather thou callest & excitest all men to come vnto Prouerb. 
                        〈◊〉
                     
                  
                  
thee, for thou takest thy pleasure to bee conuersant among the children of men.
               To thee, O lord, angels sing praises, and what other thing hast thou foūd in vs but y• filth of our sins? why wouldest thou be with vs till Math. 28. the end of the world? was it not enough for thee that thou sufferedst death for vs, and gauest vs also y• Sacraments for our medicine, & left vs the angels for our fellowes and tutors, Truly although wee are vngratefull for these benefits, yet wouldst thou dwell amongst vs, for thou art so good that thou couldst not deny thine owne selfe.
               Let vs therfore make a couenant (if it so please thee O Lord) take thou care of me, & I will haue care of thee; loue thou me, & I will loue thee: protect and preserue my bodie and soule, and by thy assistance I will keepe thy law: doe that with me, O Lord, which best pleaseth thee, for thou knowest what I wāt, and what is expedient for me: I will be thine, and no other mans. Giue me the grace, O Lord, that I may not seek or desire any thing,

but thy selfe, & that I may whollie offer my selfe vnto thee.
               O fire that kindlest me1 O charity that inflamest me! o light that illuminatest me! o my rest! o my life! O my loue, that alwaies burnest, and art neuer quenched: when shall I perfectly loue thee againe? when shall I embrace thee with y• naked armes of my soule? when shall I despise my selfe and the whole world, for thy sake? whē shal my soule with all the powers and strength thereof, bee vnited with thee? whē shall it be swallowed vp in the bottomlesse pit of thy loue? Most sweet, louing,

                  aire, wise, rich noble, precious, and worthy, both to bee beloued and adored, when shall I so loue thee, yt I may wholie be deuoured by thy loue?

And when in this sort thou hast slaine me, make mee liue with thee through loue and charitable

actions, that I may faithfully obserue all thy cōmandements, and the directions of my superiors, & onely follow those things which are of the Spirit.
               O most bountiful Iesu, giue me perfect renouncement and hatred of my sinne, and perfect conuerston of my heart vnto thee: that all my thoughts, and all my desires may bee fixed on thee, and in thee onely. O life, without which I am dead: O truth without which I am deceiued: O way, without which I go astry: O saluation, without which I perish: O light, without which I walk in darknes. Suffer me not O Lord (suffer mee not) to be at any times drawne from thee: for I liue cnely in thee, & without thee 
                     〈◊〉
                   die: in thee I am saued, and without thee I am lost: in thee I am somewhat, without thee I am nothing: because I had not bene at all, except thou hadst bene in mee: and except I were in thee, thou shouldest not bee in mee. Bee thou therefore (O good Iesu) in my memorie in the morning: by the same may I know thee: in the same

               The third prayer for the loue of God.
               IF y• duty whereby we are bound to our benefactors for the benefits we haue receiued be so great, if euerie of the bounties wee receiue, bee as it were brands and motiues of loue: if the sire waxe in greatnes according to the multitude of the fuell: O Lord how great a fire of loue ought there iustly burne in my heart, if the matter of thy bounty be so infinite, which kindleth & nourisheth the same? If the whole world, as well visible & inuisible, with all that which is found therein, bee but meere benefits of thine towards vs, how huge ought that flame of my loue bee, which ought to glow in me? And that so much the more: because I ought not to loue thee for these benefits onely,

but also for that in thee, all the causes and reasons of loue are to bee found, and they euery one of them in the highest degree of perfection.
               For if we consider thy goodnes, who is found better than thou art? if wee respect thy beauty, thou art the fairest one, whose face the angels desire to contemplate: if wee seeke for bounty & sweetnesse, who is to
                     •…
                  ee found more sweete and benigne than thou art? if we desire riches and wisdome, who richer or wiser than thou art▪ 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   friendship, who will soue any thing more thā he that pawned his life for vs? Now if we returne vnto benefits, O Lord, from whom proceedeth all that which wee haue, but from thee? what shall wee say of hope? when as from thee alone, and from thy mercie, wee hope and crpect whatsoeuer we want: if by the only right of nature, wee owe much dutie to our carnall parents: who is more father than he of whom it is

be so tenderly beloued of his wife, what other spouse hath our soule than thy selfe, O Lord? who shall replenish the bosome of my heart, and my desires but thou? If the Philosophers say that ye finall end is beloued with infinite loue: who is my beginning, who my latter end, but thou, O Lord? for frō whence tooke I my originall, and whither shall I go to be perfected, but from thee, and in thee? From whom is all that which I haue, & from whom hope I to receiue the same which I want but from thee?

So then if this speciall title, and euery one of the rest bee motiues of loue, what ought yt to be that is deriued from all these vnited together? verity, as the Sea is more spacious than all other flouds that enter into the same: and by how much it, ouercommeth the rest in greatnesse, by so much also is thy loue more abundant, greater, and more excellent, than all other eternall loues.
               
                  
Since therefore I haue so iust causes (O Lord) and so pregnant occasions to loue thee, why should I not loue thee with all my heart, with all my soule, with all my strength, and inward thoughts? O my hope, my glorie, my ioy, O my amiable beginning: O my sacietie and sufficiencie

                   when shall that day bee when I shall truely loue thee and embrace thee with my whole heart? Whē shal I shew my selfe gratefull vnto thee in all things, and for all things? When shall I feele all that mortified m ine, which is opposed against thee? Whē shal I be wholy thme? Whē shal I ceasie to be mine own? Whē shall that houre come, when nothing shall liue in me but thy selfe? When shall I feele my selfe wholy inflamed with thy loue? Whē wilt y• rauish mee perforce? When wilt thou make me drunke with yt milke of thy teares? When wilt yu transferre mee wholy into thee? When shall I see that happy day, when all impediments and perturbations of the minde taken away, thou wilt make mee one spirit with thee, so

that hereafter I shal not be drawn from thee? Ah Lord, how much cost it thee to redeeme me? but being once redeemed, how easily canst thou do good? For when y• doest good vnto man, what is takē out of thy house? what is lost of thy riches? what is taken out of thine infinite treasures? Why O Lord, doth thy wrath fight with thy mercy against mee, whereas thou art th

O my God and my saluation, why am I so idle? why runne I not wc speedie alacritie vnto thee, the chiefest good, in whom at once are all goodnesses found? I will loue thee (O Lord) with an ardent and strong loue: I will stretch ye armes of my affections and desires, that I may embrace thee the sweet spouse of my soule, from whom I promise

vnto my selfe all goodnesse. The Iu

The Iuy increaseth not so largely, neither extendeth the beauty of her branches so far, being sustained by the tree, as my soule increaseth in vertues and graces, beeing vnderpropped by this tree.
               Why therfore are not all the members of my body turned into armes that on euery side I may embrace thee? why shall I not loue thee? why shall I not put all my trust

                   are and reuerence, I come before thy sight (o my God) as one the most vnhappie, poore, and vilest creature of the world. I set my selfe neere the flouds of thy mercy, by

the riuer of thy graces, before the brightnes of the true Sunne of iustice, whose beames are spread ouer the whole earth, and communicate themselues freely to all those that shut not the window against them.
               Behold a masse of chalke, a rude and impolisht trunck cut from the tree, is presented to the hands of the most wise workmaster: make of it, O most merciful Father, that which thou hast decreed to doe. Great is my boldnesse, in that a creature so vile dare demand a loue so precious & excellent as thine is. Truly I would (considering my great indignity) require some lesser thing at thy hāds: but what shal I doe, wretch that I am, whereas thou cōmandest me that I should loue thee? Thou hast created me to the ende I should loue thee, and threatnest mee except I loue thee. Tho
                     •…
                  dst die, that I might loue thee, and commandest mee that I should aske nothing more feruently at thy hands, than thy loue: yea, & so much destrest thou to bee beloued by mee, that seeing mee without

thy loue, thou didst institute thy Sacramēt of admirable value whereby my heart might be enflamed with thy loue.
               O my Sauiour, whom am I, yt thou shouldest require my loue, & to this end thou shouldest seeke so many and so admirable meanes? What am I to thee but a torment? a crosse, and a vaily tribulation? And what art thou to me, but saluation, rest, and all goodnesse? If therfore thou louest me, why am I euerie waies trouble some vnto thee? why shall I not loue thee again, who art euery way so profitable and beneficiall to me?
               Possessed therefore, O Lord, of these pledges of thy loue: and confirmed by that thy mercifull commandement, whereby euen vnto my liues ende it pleased thee so bountifully to muite me, and command mee to loue thee: by this thy singular grace, I require another like fauour, namely that thou wilt first giue me that, which y• wouldest haue me giue thee: for I cannot giue thee this, except thon first giue it me: for I am not worthy to

loue thee, but thou art worthy to beloued by mee. I therefore dare not request thee to loue thee, but that it might please thee to giue me leaue to loue thee. Fly not, O Lord, flie me not, despise not to bee beloued by thy creatures, with the vtmost of their loue.
               O God, who art essentially loue, increated loue, infinite loue, loue without measure, not onely a louer but all loue, from whence the loue of all Seraphins & euery creature proceedeth in like manner as the light of all the starres from the brightnes of the sun, why shall I not loue thee? how can I chuse but be burnt wt this fire of loue, which inflameth the whole world, and each thing, contained in the same, yea welnigh burneth them?
               O God, who art essentialy goodnesse it selfe, from whom all that is good whatsoeuer is called good, from whom the goodnesse of all liuing creatures (no otherwise than al riuers from the sea) is deriued, in comparison of whose more than excellent goodnes, there is not any thing either in heauen or in earth

that may be called good; why therfore shall I not loue thee, whereas goodnes is the obiect of loue? If I cannot loue thee, o my Lord, for thine excellency, how can I chuse but loue thee for mine owne profite sake? The son loueth the father, who hath receiued his being from him: the members loue the head, and offer themselues to death for it, because by the same they are continued in their essence: All effects loue their causes, for from them they haue receiued whatsoeuer they are, & from them they expect that which yet they haue not: but thou o Lord art my father, my head, and my cause: that therefore which the sonne oweth the father, the mother the head: that which the effects owe to their causes, all that and far more do I owe thee.
               Thou gauest mee that beeing which I haue, more perfect than my parents did: thou keepest mee in this beeing which thou gauest mee, more carefully than the head doth the members: thou finishest in mee that which is wanting, till thou hast brought mee to the last

point of perfection. Thou art my father which made me: thou art my head which gouernest me: thou art my spouse who gauest to my soule perfect felicity: thou art the Architect of this building: thou art the painter of this figure made according to thy image and similitude, which thou wilt also make perfect. Whatsoeuer it hath, it hath it frō thee: whatsoeuer it wanteth, it hopeth to receiue it from thee. For euen as no one could giue him that which he is, but thou O Lord: so also no man can perfect that which as yet is imperfect, but thou: whatsoeuer therefore it hath, whatsoeuer it is, whatsoeuer it hopeth, all that is thine. Whom therefore shal it behold, but thee? To whom shall it bee accountable but to thee? In whose eies shall it walke, but in thine? Whither shall hee direct all his loue, but to thee, who art his whole good?
               If therefore (O Lord) thou bee the beautie and ornament of my soule, how cā I forget thee? What haue I in heauen, and what will I of thee on earth? My flesh and my

heart faileth, God of my heart, & my heritage for euer. O increate loue, which alwaies burnest & neuer art extinguished: o loue which alwaies liuest and burnest in the bosome of God. O eternall dart of the fathers heart, yt alwaies woundeth the face of the Son with the wound of infinite loue! O let this dart wound me: this fire inflame me, let me follow thee my beloued, let me sing a new song with a loud voice, let my soule melt in thy praises, with the vnspeakable applause and Iubile of loue.
               O most holy father, o most mercifull sonne, O most louing holy ghost! when wilt thou, most beloued father dwell in my soule, and abide in the secrets of my heart, & possesse me wholy? When shal I be wholy thine, and thou wholy mine? When shall it come to passe, o my King? when will that day come? o when? O were it here! Shall I neuer see it? o how vngrateful delay? how odious procrastinatiō? Haste thee, O Iesus, haste thee, and delay not: returne, returne, and runne like a Goate, and the yong hinds

vpon the mountaines of Bether.
               
               O my God, the repose of my life: the light of mine eies, my consolation in tribulations: the end of my desires: the paradise of my heart: the center of my soule: the pledge of glory: the companion of my pilgrimage: my ioy in exile, the medicine of my wounds: mercifull iusticer of my sins: master of the ignorant, guide of life, nest in which my soule resteth, hauen wherein she is saued, glasse wherein she beholdeth her selfe, staffe on which she leaneth, stone on which she is builded, & precious treasure in which shee glorieth. If thou therefore (o Lord) be all these vnto me, how can I forget yea but for a moment of time? If I forget thee Psal. 136. o my God, let mee forget my right hand; let my tongue cleane to the roofe of my mouth, if I remember Psal. 131. thee not: I will giue no sleepe vnto mine eies, o blessed Trinitie, nor rest to mine eie-lids, nor quiet to my temples, vntill I finde this loue, vntill I finde a place for my Lord in my heart, and a tabernacle for the God of Iacob in my

soule, who liueth for euer world without end.
               Amen.
            
            
               The first prayer for the loue of God.
               I Will loue thee, O Lord my strength, I wil loue thee my vnspeakable ioy, and let my whole life liue, not to my selfe, but to thee which was condemned to miserie & raised againe by thy mercy. Too late did I feare thy Maiestie: too late did I loue thee, thou beautie both old and new: too late did I loue thee: I sought thee my refreshment, and I found thee not, because I vndirectly sought thee: I sought thee without my selfe, & thou didst dwel in me: I trauelled the streets and waies of the Citty of this world, seeking thee, and I found thee not, because inconsiderately I sought thee abroad, wheras thou wert at home with mee.
               I asked y• earth whether it were my God? and it answered mee no, and all things which are in the same, confessed the very same. I asked the Sea, the depths and y• inhabitants therof, and they answered,

we are not God, seeke him aboue vs. I asked the fleeting aire, with all the dwellers therein, and he answered mee no. I asked heauen, the Sunne, the Moone, and the Starres: neither are wee thy Gods (said they) Finally, I asked all creatures: and they cried vnto mee with a loud voice, hee that made vs is thy true God & Lord. And I sayd: where therfore is my God? where shall I seek him? shew him me. And I heard a voice saying vnto me, God is in euery place seeke him in thy self, he filleth Heauen, filleth the earth, and filleth thy heart.
               And I came to my selfe, & I entred into my selfe, and I said vnto my selfe, how entrest thou hither O my God? at what doore wert thou admitted? I began to enquire & examine euery one of my senses if by any of them thou didst enter, but they likewise knew not how or which waies thou camest in. For the eies say: if he be not coloured, he cannot enter by vs. The cares say, if he make no sound, hee cānot passe by vs: The nose saith, if hee

smell not, hee could not come by me: Taste saith, if he sauored not, he entred not by me: Touch likewise addeth, if he is not corpulent, aske me nothing of this matter.
               How therefore o my loue didst thou enter my soule? and didst not enter by any doore? Truly thou art light, shining in darkenes, yet such as the eie is not capable of. Thou art a voice, sweet aboue all voices, yet such a one as the eare conceiueth not. Thou art a sweete, more fragrant than any odor, which neuerthelesse my taste comprehendeth not. Thou art an embracement, to bee esteemed aboue all embraces, which notwithstanding the touch attaineth not.
               Where wert thoutherefore, my God? where wert thou my light? where wert thou my hope? I asked & it was answered me, Ascend into the superior parts of thy heart, & there shalt thou find God. Truly thou art great, O God, and hast ouercome our wisdome. Thou art the king of kings, and the Lord of Lords. Thou art immortall, and dwellest in vnaccessible light:

whom no mortall man euer saw, or shall euer see and liue. Many and great are the wonders that are reported of thee, o Lord: yet more lesse and fewer than may be said of thee, & words are defectiue, where thou are neuer deficient. For thou exceedest all that which may bee spoken or thought.
               O onely loue, & my Lord God, thou didst loue me before I loued thee, and createdst mee according to thine owne image, and madest mee Lord ouer all thy creatures. Moreouer, thou makest thine Angels spirits for me, whō thou hast ordained to defend mee in all my waies, lest I should hurt my foote Psal. 90. against the stone. Thou wouldest not permit me to be borne in a pagan but a Christian land, in which by the water and the holy Ghost. I am regenerate & sanctified. Thou neither gauest me too much riches, nor too abiect pouerty, lest I shold either waxe proud, or grow more contemptible: but thou gauest me vnderstanding and wil, whereby I should know and loue thee.
               Thou didst cal me when I was

lost, & knockedst at my doore, but I did not answer thee. I liued according to mine own lust, and attributed too much to mine owne strength, whereas neuerthelesse it was not strength but weaknesse: I would runne, and grow presently weary: and where I thought I should bee secure, there was I in greatest danger: I went away frō thee like y• prodigall son, and trauelled into a strange countrey, and dwelt therein, whereas louing vanitie, I became vain. I was blind, & I desired blindnes: I was a seruant, & I loued seruitude: I was bound, & tooke pleasure in thraldome: I thought bitter was sweet, and sweete was bitternes. I was wretched, and I knew it not.
               Whilst I liued in this most desperate estate, thou didst cast thine eies of compassion vpon mee: and although without intermission I did offend thee, yet didst not thou giue ouer to reclaime me from my sins: when I wandered yu broughtest me into the way: when I was ignorant thou taughtest me, when I did sinne, thou didst correct me:

when I was sad, thou didst comfort mee: When I did despaire, yu didst encourage me: when I fell yu didst raise me vp: when I stood, thou sustainedst me.
               I was vndone and dead, thou descendedst vnto the dead, & tookest on thee mortality: thou a king didst descend to thy seruant: & to redeeme thy slaue thou didst betray thy selfe. So much didst thou loue mee, that thou gauest thy blood for a ransome for mee: thou didst loue me (O Lord) more than thy selfe, because thou wouldst sēd for mee: For this cause thou didst ransome mee from exile with so deere a price: thou didst redeeme me from thraldome: thou withheldedst mee from punishment: thou calledst mee by thy name, thou 
                     •…
                  ignedst me with thy blood; that thy remembrance might bee alwaies with mee and neuer depart from my heart, which for my sake departed not from the Crosse.
               Let mee know thee therefore O Lord, my acknowledger: let mee know thee thou vertue of my soule: let me walke alwaies in thy

light, O thou Sun of iustice; for it is good for me to cleaue, O Lord, Psal. 72. & to put my trust in our lord God: for as soone as I shall bee turned from thee, I am presently conuerted to transitory delights, and distracted with vaine cogitations.
               O therefore wretched & vnfortunate that I am, when shall I so inseparably cleaue vnto thee, as I may neuer bee withdrawne from thee? When shall my thoughts, words, and works, differ no more from the rule of thy equitie & iustice? Thou (o Lord) louest solitude, and I company: thou silence, and I fables: thou verity, and I vanity; thou cleannesse, and I follow vncleannesse.
               I beseech thee therefore, O Lord, for thine own sake, illuminat mine eies with thy light: woūd my heart with thy loue: direct my steppes in the way of thy commandements, that I may neuer swerue from the same: deliuer me (o Lord) that am captiue: reduce the stray into thy wounds, raise him that is fallen; and releeue him that is euery way weakned. Giue me a heart yt may

alwaies thinke on thee, a minde yt may alwaies loue thee, an vnderstanding that may conceiue thee: a reason that may alwaies strongly cleaue vnto thee the most chiefe delight.
               Fly not from my heart, depart neither frō my words nor works: but alwaies assist me, because thou art my helper in all my tribulations. Without thee I die: & thinking on thee, I am reuiued: thine adour doth recreate mee: thy memory doth heale mee: thy light doth illuminate me, & I am raised againe by thy voice, and shall bee satisfied when thy glory shall appeare.
            
            
               The sixth prayer for the loue of God.
               IF amōgst all those things which prouoke vs vnto loue, there bee nothing more effectuall than form & beauty, why should I not worthily loue thee (o my God) who art the Fountaine of all beautie and seemelines? Thou art the Ornament

of the whole Masse of this world, for whatsoeuer is beautiful in it, by thee and from thee hath his beauty, because thou createdst it: the Sunne and Moone admire thy maiestie, the Angels desire to behold thy face, for in the sight thereof consisteth perfect felicitie, and the glorie of all supernall spirits.
               Birds, flowers, foūtaines, fields, floods, seas, woods, forrests, trees, earth, mountaines, valleies, and whatsoeuer is in them, haue their ornaments from thee: thou didst decke the heauens with starres, ye aire with birds, the water with fishes, the fields with flowers, and ye earth with infinite plants, and variety of liuing creatures. In each place of the world thou art feared, because tokens of thy beauty are seene in euery place: in the heauens thou art the beautie of glorie, in hell of iustice, in good men, of grace, in the wicked of patience.
               I will therefore loue thee my God, who are the perfection of all things: thou art the praise of the Angels, the reward of Saints, y•
                  
hope of Patriarches, the Crowne of Martyrs, the glory of Confessors, yt puritie of Uirgins, and the saluation of all the elect. All blessed spirits praise thee, y• Pillars of heauen tr

                  ated: thou art in all things, yet art contained in none: thou didst create all things without necessitie: thou gouernest all things without labour thou changest all things, & thy selfe art not changed: thou only iudgest without any erro

                  turbation, thou onely distributest gifts, and thy treasure is not impaired: thou only art sufficient for thy selfe and all things: who therefore hath thee, he hath all things: and who hath thee not, although hee haue all the treasures of this world, he is poore hee is naked, he is wretched and miserable.
               One thing verie often draweth vs to such insensate a loue of some creature, that wee feare not in the

behalfe of the same, to aduenture a thousand deaths: but in thee (O Lord) whereas so many things & so great concurre together, why should I not loue thee▪ why should I not willingly suffer whatsoeuer miserie for the glory of thy name? why should I not freely spend my blood for thee, who so liberally diddest powre out thine for me? If I consider thy benefits, I owe no man more than thy self: if thy loue, no man wisheth mee better than thy selfe: if consangumitie, my soule hath not any one more neerely allied vnto her than thy selfe. Truly similitude is a great cause of loue, & what greater similitude is there, than is betweene thee (O Lord) & my soule, which is created after thy similitude and likenesse? Thou art a spirit, & my soule is a spirit thou art inuisible, & my soule is also inuisible: thou immortall, & my soule is immortall: thou hast vnderstanding, memory, and will: and the like powers hath my soule.
               Thou being most simple and inuisible, art all in the whole world, and all in euery part thereof: and

my soule being of the same condition is all in the whole body, and all in euery member of the same.
               Since therfore there is so much similitude betweene thee & mee, O my loue, why should I not loue thee? Is it because thou art high, & I humble? or for that thou art the Creator, and I thy creature: or because thou art the perfectest being, and I altogether imperfect? This ought not to hinder, but to increase our loue. For the similitude is far more am

                     〈◊〉
                   more sweetly, if they be reduced vnto proportion, than those that are consonant and vniforme. Let then this inequalitie, which is betweene thee & my soule, (o Lord) be a cause of greater loue
               In thee therefore, O most sweet spouse of my soule, in thee are all the causes of loue, which may bee

imagined, and thou art most worthy to bee beloued with infinite loue: but I finde in my selfe, my wil in such manner depraued, that it cannot performe it, would God it were not so that she loued her selfe more than thee.
               Wherfore, O Lord, except thou heale my infirme nature by thy grace: and except thou powre into my heart the vertue of charitie, by the mediation of the holy Ghost, I may neuer loue thee with a gratuitall and supernaturall loue, in such manner as thou art worthy, & wilt be beloued. Giue mee the grace to loue thee, if not with such a loue as thou art worthy of, yet at leastwise with such a loue as my nature may partake, that is, with all my heart, all my soule, all my strength, & all my forces, so yt all my bowels inwardly burne, & melt in thy loue.
               Grant that I may loue thee, wt a simple, willing, and free loue, without any respect of profit. Grāt that with pure loue, & no peruerse intentiō, I may desire nothing but thy selfe for thy selfe. Grant me (O Lord) a strong and inuincible loue,

that may refuse or abhorre no perils, no labours, no damages, no iniuries, or torments for thy sake.
               Giue mee a ready and diligent loue, that may alwaies be occupied in matters pertaining to thy seruice. Giue me an inestimable loue (O Lord) that may contemne all things for thy sake: giue me a discreete loue, which with immoderate zeale and feruour, shall not exceed thy law.
               Finally, giue me (o my God) yt grace to loue thee with an ordinate loue, which loueth al things according to yt dignity of their proportion, but thee aboue all things wt a sweete and amiable loue: which shall taste no sweetnes or pleasure in any thing but in thee: with a loue, burning in zeale, that destreth nothing more than thy glory: hateth nothing more than ignominie imputed to thy holy Name. Finally, with a loue so violent, that it may pul my hart from all things that are transitorie, and alwaies draw the same vpwards vnto thee, vntill I may passe ouer all this place of exile, into yt celestiall countrey,

where beholding the greatnes of thy beauty face to face, I may perpetually loue thee, with those perfect louers that neuer ceasse to loue and praise thee, the King of Kings, Lord of Lords, and God of Gods in Sion.
               Amen.
            
            
               The seuenth prayer for the obtaining of Gods loue.
               O Most high, mightie, omnipotent, mercifull, iust, strong, & incomprehensible God, and my Lord. Thou that art sweeter than any hony, whiter than milke, clearer than all light, and more precious than al pearle, there are infinit causes which rauish my heart with thy loue.

                   these things are in thee, O Lord, and for euery one

of them art thou to be loued, since thou art the chiefest good.
               But since euery good thing is truely amiable by it selfe, yet euery man affecteth more his proper good: I will therefore loue thee, o Lord my God, not onely because thou art the chiefest good, but also because thou art my good: for when I consider and weigh with my selfe, by how many titles and meanes thou art made mine, my inward parts melt, and I cry with the spouse: My spouse is beloued of me, and I of him. Cant. 2.
               
               For thou (o Lord) art my creator, thou art my sanctifier and glorifier, thou gauest mee my being in nature, thou gauest mee that of grace, and wilt giue mee the being of glory. Thou art my helper, my gouernour, defender, tutor, and keeper: finally, thou art my God, my Lord, thou art my saluation, thou art my hope, thou art my glory, thou art all my good.
               Uerily, yu art all those vnto mee, in as much as thou art my God, in so much as thou art my creator, and the conseruer of all things.

But in as much as thou art man, there are many other titles, other offices, and other bonds wherwith I am bound vnto thee, and thou vnto me. For which I also (if it were possible) ought to loue thee, and that by reason, with an in

                  nite and diligent loue: for thou art my restorer, for thou hast restored mee to entire humane nature, which by sin was weakned in me. Thou art my deliuerer, for by thy captiuity, thou hast deliuered me from the tyranny of sin, death, hell, and the diuell, my most capital enemies, Thou art my Redeemer, for thou hast ransomed mee from seruitude, into which through sinne I was fallen, by the shedding of the incomparable treasure of thy precious blood.
               Thou art my King, for thou gouernest me by thy Spirit, thou foughtest for mee, and deliueredst me from the hands of my enemies: thou art my priest, for thou praiedst & incessantly praiest like an euerlasting priest for me, in y• sight of thy celestiall Father. Thou art my sacrifice, for yu offeredst vp thy

selfe on the altar of the Crosse, that by thy clemency thou mightest expiate my crimes. Thou art my aduocate, for when the Diuell accuseth me, and offereth the libel wherein my sins are written, to thy father, thou dost protect my cause, thou makest paiment with thine owne, & dost supply all that which my iustice defaulteth in. Thou art my Mediator, for thou art God and man, and a mighty friend of God, and yt true Son of God, so puttest thou thy selfe, as a mediator betweene me and God.
               Thou art my shepheard, for y• feedest & gouernest my soule like a sheepe of thy flocke: thou art my meate, for thou art hee by whom I am nourished in the diuine Sacrament of the Altar: thou art my father, and the father of the world to come: for thou hast regenerated me with grieuous dolours on the tree of the Crosse, and giuen me a new essēce by y• holy Spirit. Thou art my head, & the vniuersall head of the Church: for from thee, as from the true head, floweth into the same, and euery member thereof,

vertue, life, and spirituall sense. Thou art my true Physition, for by thy blood thou hast healed the wounds and strips of my soule.
               Thou art my master, for by the light of thy doctrine thou hast shewed mee the way to the celestiall country. Thou art my example, for not onely in words, but that which is farre more, in deedes and most holy examples of thy life, thou hast led me in this way.
               Thou art my strength and mercy, for there is no tribulation or griefe so great which the memorie of thy passions that thou sufferedst for me doth not make sweete & tollerable. Thou art my honour and glory, for thou becamest man for mee, thou madest mee thy brother, and a consort of thy nature.
               To conclude, thou art my Sauiour, yea & such a sauiour, that euery where, alwaies, & in all things art sufficient for me: for thou hast most perfectly wrought all that on the earth, which was requistte for my saluatiō. Thou hast illuminated my ignorance by thy doctrine, thou hast strengthned my weaknes

by thy examples. Thou hast inflamed my warmth by thy benefits, thou hast instructed my soule in thy mysteries, thou hast enriched my pouerty by thy merits: Thou hast healed my wounds by thy Sacraments, thou hast satisfied by thy dolors for my defaults, & now in Heauen thou sittest on the right hand of thy Father, as mine aduocate: what neede many wordes? Thou art made vnto me wisdome and iustice, sanctification and redemption, and therefore all goodnesse. 2. Cor. 1.
               
               What impudence were it therefore in me not to loue my Lord, who did all this for my sake, & to whom I am bound vnder so many titles & benefits? If men with the same loue where-with they affect them selues, do also loue al those things which are their owne, why should I not also loue thee (O Lord) if I would haue thee to bee mine, and that by so many offices and benefits, & in things so pregnant? And if for euery one of these benefits I owe thee my whole heart, and not this one onely, but more if I had

them: what shall I owe thee, or what am I not indebted vnto thee if we ioyne all these benefits together? What iniquitie therefore should it be, not to giue one heart wh
                     •…
                  h I haue, vnto him to whom I owe so many, and other diuerse things? And if euery one of these benefits be a goade or prouocation to loue, yea, and arrowes to pierce the hearts of men, how shall I choose blit burne amids so many flames of loue? How comes it to passe that I am altogether cold? amidst so many weapōs, how escape I from wounds? How comes it to passe, that I perseuer in the hardnesse of my heart, as it were without sense?
               O Lord, I lament in thy presence the dulnesse, & insensibility of my heart, I confesse the infidelity thereof: for yu raining into it innumerable causes of loue, yet receiuest nothing from y• came that deserueth so many fauours. O heart more felon than furious beastes; more insensible than stones, more hard than Adamant, that is not mollified by so many strokes!

I pray thee therefore, O thou fairest amongst the children of men, grant that I may desire thee, loue thee as much as I list, & as much as I ought. Thou art immeasurable, and oughtest to be loued beyond measure, especially of vs, whom thou hast so loued, so saued, and for whom thou hast done so great and so many things. O loue that alwaies burnest, & art neuer extinct: sweet Christ, good Iesu, charity, my God, inflame me wholy with thy fire, with thy loue, with thy sweetnes, with thy affection, with thy desire, with thy charitie, with thy pleasure, & ioy, which is holy and good, which is chast and cleane: that wholy filled with the sweetnes of thy loue, wholy kindled with the flame of thy charity, I may loue thee my most sweet Lord with my whole heart, with all my soule, with all my strength, with al my intention, and let nothing bee in me that doth not loue thee.
               And for that to loue, is to wish well to him wee loue, and thou (O Lord) aboundest with so much goodnesse that I cannot wish thee

more than thou hast: that onely thing I wish, that thou be possessed of my heart also, and that all yt is mine, may be thine: and for thine infinite glory, I giue thee heartie thāks. This likewise do I desire, that al creatures should serue thee, honor thee, praise, & glorifie thee, and that the whole earth should be filled with thy praises. Let this be alwaies my desire, this my meat, this my dainties to praise thee alwaies; & let thy laudes be alwaies in my lips. But because praise is not seemely in the mouth of a sinner, let the Saints, and all the spirits of the celestiall throne praise thee continually: for to them praise belongeth.
               O all ye works of yt Lord therefore, blesse yee the Lord, praise yet and magnifie him for euer. O yee Angels and Archangls, blesse yee the Lord, praise yee and magnifie him for euer. O yee vertues & dominations, blesse ye yt Lord, praise him and magnifie hime for euer. O ye prince-domes & powers, blesse ye the Lord, praise him and magnifie him for euer, &c. Yee blessed

thrones in which God sitteth an iudgeth, blesse ye the Lord, praise him, &c. O ye Cherubins, & Seraphins that burne altogether inflamed with the loue of your creator, blesse ye the Lord, praise him, &c. O yee Apostles and Euangelists, founders of the Christiā Church, blesse yee the Lord, praise him, &c. O yee glorious hosts of Martyrs, blesse yee the Lord, praise him, &c. O all ye renownced and chaste virgins, blesse ye the Lord, praise him and magnifie him for euer. Blessed is the God of our Fathers, & blessed bee the name of thy glorie, holy and laudable, and magnified for euer and euer.
               Amen.
            
            
               The first prayer vnto the holy Trinitie, expressing the Maiestie thereof.
               LOrd God, without beginning, immortall, incomprehensible, incircumscribed, incorporall, indefinite, vnsearchable, inuisible, immutable, euery where present, but hidden, euery where al, but immeasurable,

who by thy neuer too much praised wisdome, hast created this huge world, and placed man in the same: holy Trinity, one God haue mercie vpon me.
               If that Publican in the Gospel durst not lift vp his eies to heauē, but standing afar off, strooke his breast, saying: God be merciful vnto Luke 18. me a sinner: if that holy penitent was affraid to appeare before the presence of our Lord, but standing behinde neare his feete, obtained remission of her sins by him, teares flowing from her eies: if that holy Luke 7. Patriarch Abraham, willing to talk with thee o God, said, shal I speak vnto my Lord whereas I am but Genes. 18. dust and ashes? If all these were so humble and so reuerent in respect of thee, comming before the sight of thy diuine maiestie, & thy most holy: what shall a poore & miserable sinner doe, such as I am? what shall dust and ashes doe? what shal the Abysse of all miserie & sins do? But because, o Lord, I cannot obtaine that feare & reuerence, which is due to so great a maiesty, except I fixe mine eies immediatly on the

same: giue mee leaue to dare to lift vp mine eies vnto thee: neither let the brightnes of thy glorie bee an impediment to the frailty of my sight. Truely I see that thou art yt great God that transcendest al the reach of our vnderstanding: I know that no vnderstanding created can comprehend thee: and although this be thus, yet can I not do any thing more profitable, than to fire mine eies on thee.
               Therefore, O most high, omnipotent, merciful, iust, faire, strong, stable, simple, perfect, incomprehensible, secret, and yet present withall: inuisible, and yet seeing all things: immutable, changing and renewing al things: whom altitudes dilate not, neither limits restraine, nor variety changeth, nor corruption wasteth, nor affliction fasteneth on, nor ioyes moue in his essence: from whom neither obliuion detra

                  h, nor to whom memory addeth any thing: to whom neither things yt are past, are past: nor things to come shall succeed: to whom nothing gaue beginning, nor time augment, neither any

thing shall giue end, for thou liuest and reignest for euer. Thou art he who possesseth all things in all places: and that disposest them sweetly. Thou art he that createdst all things, without any necessitie, and conseruest them, without labour, and gouernest all things without molestation, and mouest al things, thy selfe being immoueable. Thou art all eie, all foote, all hand: for thou seest, sustainest, and wor
                     •…
                   all things. Thou art in al things, & yet art not concluded: thou art without all things, and yet art not disioyned. Thou art vnder all things, & yet art not subiect: yu art aboue al things, & yet art not lifted vp. Thou art the soueraigne and true God, the soueraigne and true life, from whom and by whom all things haue birth and being.
               Thou (O Lord) art very goodnes and beauty it selfe: by which, and from which, all that is good & faire, is good and faire. Thou art he who willest vs to leeke thee, and giuest vs leaue to finde thee: thou bidst vs knocke, and thou openest when wee call vpon thee: thou art

hee whom to forsake, is to fall, and whom to weare, is to rise: and in whom to stand, is to endure for euer. Thou art hee, whom no man forsaketh, but the foolish: no man seeketh, except hee bee called: no man findeth, except he be purged: thou art hee whose knowledge is life; whose seruice is a Kingdome: whose praise is saluation: and yu art the very ioy of those that reio
                     •…
                  e in thee. What therefore shall I, O my king & Sauior, what shal I say vnto thee? I say a wretched worme, what shal I say of ye greatnes of so many praises? I wil say yt which the Prophets (inspired wt thy truth) said: who hath measured the waters with a hand, & weighed Esay 40. the heauens with a palme? who hanged the weight of the earth on three fingers, & poised the mountaines in ballances, and the hils

prudence? Behold, the Gentiles are but as a drop of a bucket, and are reputed as a graine in the ballance. Loe, ye Ilands are but as a little dust, & the Woods of Lybanus shal not be sufficient to burne, and the beasts shal not suffice for a sacrifice: All nations, as if they were not, so are they before him: & in his sight are reputed as nothing, & a vain thing. For if at the presen

               I adore thee therefore especially (O Lord) with profound humility and due reuerence, with that adoration and worship, which is only due vnto thee and to no other creature: with such duty as all the dominations of heauen, and all the creatures of the world adore thee: of whom though many know thee not, yet can they not choose, but euery one in their kinde adore thee,

end in their manner offer homage to the Scepter of thy diuinity, and acknowledge thy greatnesse. For thou onely art the God of Gods: thou only the King of Kings, thou onely the Lord of Lords, and the cause of causes: thou art Al

                     ha and Omega, the beginning and ending Apoc. 22. of all things: Thou art the beginning without beginning, and the end without end. Thou onely art he yt thou art, for all other things how excellent soeuer they bee, haue their beeing borrowed from another? but thy beeing is high, perfect, vniuersall, and that dependeth on none other. And therefore deseruedly art thou said to bee that which thou art, because whatsoeuer is created, hath no beeing, if it be compared with thine.
               For which cause (O Lord) acknowledging all these great and wanderfull things, prostrate before the foote of thy Diuine presence, with all that humility which I am able to expresse, I adore thee in such maner as those blessed spirits adore thee, who falling downe before thee, seated in thy Thro

of Maiesty, and laying down their Apoc. 4. crownes before thy feete, adore thee: & confesse that all that which they haue, proceedeth from thee. So I also (o Lord) who am the vilest of all creatures, adore thee, and a thousand times remember thee, confessing vnto thee, that thou art my true Lord and God, and that all that which I am, or whatsoeuer I finde in my selfe, as my being, liuing & breathing, is all thine: and therfore I call vpon all creatures, that they together with mee may praise thee, adore thee, glorifie thee, in that diuine song of the Prophet saying: Come let vs sing vnto the Lord, let vs praise ye 
                  Psal 94. God of our saluation, let vs come before his presence with thanksgiuing, and reioyce to him with Psalmes: because our God is a great God, & a great King aboue all Gods: in his hands are all the corners of the earth & the height of the hilles is his also: The sea is his, and he made it, and his hands fashioned the drie land. Come therefore let vs adore and fall downe before him, and weepe before

our Lord God that made vs, for hee is our Lord God, and wee are his people, and the sheepe of his pasture.
               Wherefore (O my God) since thou art so worthy to bee adored and honored, giue me grace, that without intermission I may magnifie thee: not onely in words and with my tongue, but also in my heart, my actions, and my whole life: Thou which liuest and reignest, world without end.
               Amen.
            
            
               The second praier to the holy Trinitie, of the greatnesse of the diuine Maiestie.
               OMnipotent & eternall God, three in persons, one in substance, iust and meet it is, & agreeable with reason, that I should imploy all my whole life in the exercise of repentance & feare: when as I haue so iust causes of lament & feare. Tuen as therfore the greatnesse of thy glory impelleth mee to honour and praise thee: so also commandeth it mee to praise and

glorifie thee: For a Hymne becommeth thee in 
                     •…
                  ion, and a vow shall be made to thee in Ierusalem, because thou art the Ocean of all perfections, the Sea of wisedome, the Abysse of power, beauty, greatnesse, riches, sweetnesse and maiestie: in which are all perfections and beauties of creatures, which are in heauen, or on earth; and all these perfections are found in thee, in the highest perfection & degree. All beauty compared to thee, is deformitie: all riches, pouerty: all strength, weakenesse: all wisedome, ignorance: all sweetenesse, bitternesse: and to conclude many things in a few, all things that are in heauen and on earth, make lesse appearance in thy sight than a little candle before the sunshine.
               Thou art perfect in all things, without any deformity: great wt
                  out quantity, good without quality, strong without infirmitie, true without falsitie, alwaies present without place, in all places, without diuision. In magnitude yu art infinite, in vertue omnipotent, in

goodnesse chiefe, in wisedome inestimable, in counsels terrible, in iudgements iust, in thoughts secret, in words true, in works holy, in mercy copious, towards sinners patient, toward penitents, compassionate.
               But what in especiall should I speake of thy wisedome, but that which earst the Prophet▪ aid: O Lord, thou knowest my thoughts afar off, thou hast searcht my commings in and goings out, and all my waies hast thou foreknowne, because there is no speech in my tongue which thou knowest not. Behold, O Lord, thou knowest al things, both the first and the last: Thou hast made mee, and laid the hand vpon me: Such knowledge is too wonderfull & excellent for me, I cānot attaine vnto it. Whither shall I goe from thy spirit, or whither shal I fly frō thy presence: if I climbe vp to heauen, thou a
                     •…
                   there: if I goe downe to hell, thou art there also: if I take the wings of the morning, and remaine in the vtmost parts of the sea, euen there also shall thy hand leade mee, and

thy right hand shall hold me. If I say ye darkenes shall couer me, then shall thy right hand bee turned to day: yea, the darkenes is no darknesse with thee, but the night is as cleare as day, the darkenesse and light to thee are both alike. For his eies, saith another, are vpon the waies of men, & hee considereth all their steps: there is no darknes nor shadow of death to hide them that work iniquity. But what shal I say of ye greatnes of thy power? I wil say that in times past which ye Prophet said, saying: For God is my king of old, the helpe that is Psal. 74. done vpon earth, hee doth it himselfe: Thou diddest deuide the sea through thy power, thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters. Thou smotest the heads of the dragons, and gauest them for meate to thy people, in the wildernesse: thou broughtest out fountaines and waters out of the hard rockes, thou driedst vp many waters. The day is thine, & the night is thine, thou hast prepared the light and the sun: thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast

made sommer and winter. And in another place the same Prophet saith: O Lord God of hoasts, who Psal. 89. is like vnto thee? thy truth, most mighty Lord, is on euery side. Thou rulest ye raging of the sea: yu stillest the waues therof when they arise: thou hast subdued Egypt, & destroied it: thou hast scattered thine enemies abroad with thy mighty arme. The heauens are thine, and the earth is thine: thou hast laid the foundation of the round world, and all yt therein is. Thou hast made the North & the South:

                   shall reioyce in thy name. Thou hast a mighty arme, strong is thy hand, & high is thy right hand. Blessed Iob knew this thy power, when he said. With him is counsel, & strength, wisedome, & vnderstanding. Behold, if he breake downe a thing, who can set it vp again? If he shut a thing, who will open it? Behold, if he withhold the waters, they

                  ee that is deceiued are his: hee

carrieth away the wise men as it were a spoile, and maketh yt Iudges fooles: hee looseth the rule of Kings, & guirdeth their loines wt a band: he leadeth away the great men into captiuity, and turneth the mightie vpside downe: he stoppeth the mouth of them that speake truth, and disappointeth ye aged of their vnderstanding: hec poureth contempt vpon Princes, and maketh the strength of the mightie weake. Looke what lieth hid in darkenesse, hee declareth it openly, and the verie shadow of death bringeth he to light: he increaseth the people, and destroieth them: he maketh them to multiply, and diminisheth them.
               These o Lord, are testimonies of thy mightines: but what shal I say of the riches of thy glory, and the veine of thy felicitie? If thou hast sinned, saith ye scripture, what hast yu done against him? if thy offences be many, what hast thou done Iob 35. vnto him? if thou bee righteous, what giuest thou him, or what wil he receiue at thy hands? Thy wickednesse may hurt a man as thou

art, and thy righteousnes may profit the sonne of man. But thou (O Lord) art such, and so blessed, as thou needest not another mans goods: I confesse thee to be such a one, for such a one I praise thee, and glorifie thy most holy name. Infuse thy light into my heart, & giue me words in my mouth, that my heart may alwaies think of thy mightines, and let thy praise be in my mouth for euer. But for that thy laud is not seemely in y• mouth of a sinner, I therefore require all the Angels of heauen, and all the creatures of the world that they together with me, may praise thee, and may supply my defect, inuiting them thereunto with that glorious song which the three children sung in the midst of the fierie furnace in Babylon, saying: Blessed bee the Lord God of our fathers, bee hee praised & magnified for euer. And Daniel 3, blessed be the name of his glorie, holy and laudable, and magnified for euer and euer. Blessed art thou in the throne of thy maiestie, to bee praised and magnified for euer. Blessed art thou that beholdest the

depths, and sittest vpon ye Cherubins, to be praised and magnified for euer. Blessed art thou in the firmament of heauen, and praised and glorified, world without end.
               Amen.
            
            
               The third prayer to the holy Trinitie.
               GOD, holy of holiest, God omnipotent, God eternall, God that art strong, God of spirits, and all flesh, at whose presence heauen and earth trembleth, at whose beck the heauens and elements obey, trinitie in vnitie, and vnitie in trinitie, Father, Son, & holy Ghost, thou being of my being, life that quickenest me, light that illuminatest me, science that instructeth me: yet aboue all essence, light, life and science: all creatures adore and celebrate thee: and I incited by the dutie. I owe thee, this day do bow the knees of my heart before the footstoole of thy Maiestie.
               I giue thee thanks yt thou not onely didst frame me when I was nothing, but also didst fashion mee

according to thine owne forme, that is, gauest mee a perfect shape; that where I deserued no fauour, thou hadst compassion on mee: for that thou hast sanctified mee with the sacraments of y• Church: that from my child-hood hitherto thou hast brought me vp in al goodnes.
               But O thou maker of heauen & of earth, whereas I am not able to serue thee to any vse, for whose cause didst thou so much bountie vpon me? how commeth it to passe that thou louest mee so much? for what haue I giuen thee to induce thee to recompence me? yea, where was I before I was made, that I might shew thee a former curtesie? Truly, by thy benefit in times past I was made & dignified with many blessings: thy bounty and benignity hath done all this, and I being insufficient to yeeld thanks for only one of them, how can I requit so many thousands? And how may darkenesse praise light? how may vanity commend verity? how 
                     〈◊〉
                   a mortal man (by nature fraile) conceiue thine immortalitie? how may a grosse substance comprehend

him, who is free from all weight of matter? how may vncleannes praise puritie? who then shal applaud thy works? who shall resound thy praises? but thou like a most mercifull Father, receiuest our vowes, and takest in good part thy childrens thāsgiuing whosoeuer. Make me therfore worthy, O good God, to giue thee thanks, to cleaue perpetually to thy charitie, that I may praise thee for ye many and mighty benefits wherewith yu hast honoured mee. That I may pay thee thanksgiuing for ye perils from whence thou hast deliuered me. Finally, yt I may doe thee dutie for protecting mee both in prosperity & aduersitie: because thou hast done all things with discretion; and for that thou art the Lord of our bodies and soules, of life & death, of health and sicknes, of felicity & infelicity. To bee short, the moment of all things dependeth on thy hand. Thou dost reioyce in vs by thy benefits, thou dost amate vs by thy menaces, thou differedst in chastising & comfortest vs, reclaming our frailty vnto thy self.
               
                  
Glory be to thy wondrous power, praise to thy vnsatiable loue to mankinde: gouerne the rest of our life, most mercifull guide and vigilant gouernour: deliuer mee, O Lord, from all mine enemies, visible and inuisible: stretch out thy bounteous hand, that may drawe vs out of the deepe waters of the roaring flouds of this world, and that may relieue and lighten the dangers of our nauigation. Gouerne y• the magistracy, O King, which thou hast committed to our charge: for thou art the steersman, we the rudder, let thy hand therefore inuisibly rule this Rudder whither it please the, and whither thou hast decreed it; for neither wil I trust in my bow, neither shal my sword saue me: but thy right hand and thine arme, and the cleare light of thy countenance.
               Thy wil be done, o King, in vs, as it is in heauen and earth: if at any time wee shall run astray from the lawes of thy commandements, conceiue not suddaine wrath, O most mercifull God, since thou art not ignorant how fraile and weak

we are from our beginning: if thou list thou canst saue mee: vouch safe it may be accordant to thy wil. For vnlesse thy power strengthen mee, I cannot do that which I would.
               Consider my heart therefore, with the vnspeakable sweetenes of thy bounty, to the end that a little sense, and taste of the future and eternall blessednesse which we shall enioy in thee, may refresh our minds. Lastly, make nice worthie, that after this present life, I may hasten vnto thee my Lord & God: that I may behold the riches of thy kingdome, and contemplate the beautie of thy looke: which grant, o most holy King, my true God and maker, for thy Sonnes sake our Lord Iesus Christ,
               Amē.
            
            
               A prayer vnto the Father, wherein we demand sanctification.
               THou that rulest in the highest, reignest for euer, & onely canst doe all things, God the gouernor of heauen and earth, at whose becke

all creatures tremble, & the pillars of heauen shake. O heauenly God, perfect workman and Potter, I wretch made out of clay, or rather of filthy mudde, with feare and trembling come before the throne of thy maiestie. I acknowledge & confesse my wickednesse, I know that I am nothing, yea that I am meere abomination and horror in thy sight, if thy grace and mercie do faile me: without thee I thinke no goodnes, without thee I do no good thing: without thee I am a contemptible creeping worme.
               I cannot be saued without thine assistance, my saluation dependeth on thy hands. I giue thee thanks, O God, & in especiall for this, for that thou hast giuen me that know ledge, that I may see and know yt I am nothing, and vnable to do aniething without thee. Thou art ye Potter, I the clay: such as thou wilt haue mee bee, such canst thou forme and fashion me: if thou makest mee blessed, thou shewest thy mercy & grace: if thou castest mee into perdition, thou shewest thy iustice, and executest thy iudgement:

neither is it my duety to contradict thee, why, or vnder what reason thou doest it. For thou hast mercy vpon him whom thou louest: these things I meditate with my selfe, o Lord, & I feare thy iudgements.
               Since therefore all my safety & saluation dependeth on thee, and consisteth in thy hand and power, and sith thou hast shewed thy selfe a mercifull & long-suffering God to the whole world: and hast testified the same indeed, in that thou woldest thy only son Iesus Christ the innocent, should die for our offences, and expiate our sinnes with his blood on the Crosse. Finally, since thou hast taught vs in all our perturbations to cal vpon thee, and aske thy grace and mercy, for that thou wilt giue vs all things which wee shall aske in the Name of thy Sonne: I come vnto thee, being drosse and a lumpe of clay, O mercifull and celestiall Potter, beseeching thee most humbly, that thou wilt vse thy mercie, and make of this vnworthy matter, a Uessell of eternall Glorie. Uouchsafe also of thy meere grace,

to fixe my minde on perfect faith, assured hope, and chaste and holie loue, that being iustified by these thy gifts, I may become vpright, perfect, good and holy, according to thy good will both in the midst, and end of my life, as also at the latter day of iudgement.
               O mercifull Father, grant mee pardon of all my sinnes: through y• death of thy beloued Sonne Iesus Christ, make me to please thee alone: grant me to be thy gratefull sonne and heire, increase in me that iustice whatsoeuer, which is giuen me, and granted from heauen, that I may continue and end my life

               A prayer to God the Sonne.
               OThou maker and redeemer of makinde, Iesus Christ, who saiedst, I am ye way, the truth, and the life: the way in doctrine, precept and examples: the truth in promises: ye life in reward: I pray thee by thy vnspeakeable charitie, wherwith thou daignest to imploy thy selfe wholly for our saluation, suffer mee neuer to wander from thee who art the way: neither euer to distrust in thy promises, who art the truth and performest whatsoeuer thou doest promise: neither to repose or relie on any other thing, because thou art eternall life, than which, there is nothing more to bee desired, neither in heauen nor in earth. By thee haue we learned the true and ready way to eternall saluation, lest wee should wander any longer in the Labyrinthes of this life. Thou didst teach vs exactly how to beleeue, what to doe, what to hope, and in whom we ought to rest: by thee we haue learnt how vn

happy we were borne through our first father Adam, by thee wee haue learnt that there is no hope of saluation, except by faith in thee.
               Thou hast taught vs yt thou art the onely light that shinest to all men in the desart of this world, cō
                  ducting them through the night of their mindes, from the Egyptian darkenesse, to that blessed Land which thou promisest vnto the meeke, and such as follow thy humility. For in vs was nothing but vtter darknesse, who neither could see our calamity, neither know frō whence to secke the remedy of our misery: thou daignedst to enter into the world, vouchsafedst to take vpon thee our nature, that thy doctrine might disperse the cloud of our ignorāce: that by thy precepts thou mightst direct our feete in ye way of peace: by the examples of thy life thou didst limit out a path for vs to immortality: & beating it with thy steps, thou madest it of a tedious & rough, an easie & beaten way. So becamest thou vnto vs a way, that knoweth no errour, in which lest wee should bee wearied,

thy bounty with great and assured promises, vouchsafed to assure vs: for who could bee wearied, that thinketh how in following thy footsteps there is an heritage of eternal life prepared for him? Therfore whilst we are in this iourney, thou wouldest in stead of a staffe be an assured hope vnto vs whereby wee might be sustained.
               Neither was thy goodnes contented herewith, but acknowledging the frailty of our natures, in the meane space with the comfort of ye holy Spirit y• repairest our courages, to the end that wee may more willingly run vnto thee. And as thou being made a way vnto vs driuest away all errour, so becomming our truth, thou takest away all distrust.
               Finally, being made life vnto vs, thou giuest heate vnto those that are dead in sinne, a life through thy holy spirit which quickneth all things, vntill all mortality laid aside, in ye resurrection we may alwaies liue with thee and in thee, by reason that thou art vnto vs al in all things: For it is eternall life

to know the Father, & the Sonne, and the holy Ghost, to be one true God. Wherfore I beseech thee, O most mercifull Father, to increase faith in me who am thy vnworthie seruāt, lest at any time I wauer in thy celestiall doctrine: increase obedience in me, lest I swerue from thy precepts, increase constancy, that walking in thy waies, I neither bee allured by the inticements of sathan, nor deiected by his terrors: but that I may perseuere in thee who art the true way, to my liues end. Increase my faith, that possessed of thy promises, I may neuer waxe slow in the study of godlinesse: but forgetting those things I haue left behinde mee, I may alwaies striue and endeuour for more perfection.
               Increase thy grace in me, that daily more and more being mortified my selfe: I may liue and be incouraged by thy holy Spirit, fearing nothing but thee, than whom there is nothing more amiable, glo rying in none but in thee, who art the true glorie of all the Saints, wishing nothing but thee, th

               O sweet louer of cleane hearts, burne and inflame all my bowels with the sweet fire of thy loue, that being inflamed, they may bee carried and rauished into thee, who art the center & finall end of all my good: o sweet louer of holy soules, since thou art not ignorant that I can doe nothing of my selfe, nor by my selfe: stretch out thy fauourable hand ouer me, & grant that I may forsake my selfe, & fly vnto thee: mortifie, extinguish and dissolue in me whatsoeuer is displeasant vnto thee, that in all things

When shall I be satiate with the presence of thy glory? When shal I by thy meanes be deliuered from all temptations? and when shall I ouercome this frailty of my mortality?

Would to God, O Lord, it might please thy bounty that my heart should bee such, that I might not feare to inuite thee, but that thou mightest come & dwel with me, and I might

deserue to entertaine thee kindly, & thou in the same heart mightst rest contentedly for all eternities. O that I might embrace thee with so powerfull armes of loue, that neither in thought or affection I might euer bee drawne from thee.

Iesu, that being dispoiled of thy garmēts, thou sufferedst that maiden skin of thine to be laid naked: and then tied with hard cords vnto a pillar, thou wouldst suffer the same flesh to be torne with horrible scourges, to the end thou mightest heale our wounds by thy wounds. O Lord, spoile my heart of all vncleane cogitations: put off mine old man, with all the concupiscence thereof, and put mee on a man, which is created according to thine owne similitude and likenesse, in iustice and sanctitie: and grant mee that with all patience & humility, I may sustaine the whip of thy fatherly visitation.
               I giue thee thanks, benigne Iesu, that after so many wounds, so 30 Iesus is crowned. many stripes receiued in that scourging for my sake, after so copious bloodshedding from all thy body, that thou wert diuers wayes mocked and scorned at, and to thy greater disgrace they put thee on a Purple garment, & platting a Crowne of thorns, they put it on thy head, they gaue thee a reed in

thy hand in stead of a Scepter, and bowing their knees, saluted thee, or rather mocked thee by the name of King, saying: All haile king of the Iewes. Grant, O Lord, that the memory of this miserable tragedy may be imprinted in my heart, and neuer bee blotted out of the same: pierce the same with the ardent arrowes of thy charity, that I may onely loue thee, only thinke of thee onely rest in thee: and that neither tribulation, anguishes, or any persecutions, may separate mee from thee: neither let mee take it grieuously if at any time men contemne and set me at nought for thy sake.

Grant (O Lord) that I also may powre out deuout teares of compassion and loue so aboundantly, that the hardnesse of my heart may be mollified, and made acceptable in the sight of thy Maiestie.

May it please thee (O Lord,) that y• memory of this cup may extinguish in mee all inordinate desire of belly cheere, and delight of the flesh: and bring to passe that I may neuer giue consent to any filthy and vnlawfull delectations: but giue mee the most honest and the most necessarie vertue of temperance, as well in eating, and in drinking, as in other things: yt refraining all gluttonous appetites, I may onely hunger and thirst after thee, and fixe my whole pleasure on thee.

Grant mee, O Lord the true loue of pouerty, that I may neuer bee distracted through the want of worldly wealth, but that I may beare my Crosse, and the necessities of this life, with all patience. Spoile my heart O Lord, of all carthly imaginations and affections, and renew in me daily liuing desires of thy holy loue.

Thou like wise didst suffer thy holy hands and sacred feete to be pierced with hard and thicke nayles, & affixed to the Crosse. Grant me (O Lord)

that with a gratefull and thankful heart I may alwaies haue in mind thy most ardent charity, by meanes whereof thou so bountifully extendedst thine armes, & openedst thy hands, that they might be pierced; and setledst thy feete, that they might be boared with hard nailes: Goe to (O LORD) arise and wound my heart with perfect charitie: pierce all my senses with the same nailes of thy loue, that my thoughts and desires may be neuer separated from thee.

O blood that gauest mee life & saluation, disdaine not, o Lord, to wash mee in that blood, to

sanctifie me, and purifie me in that precious liquor. Offer the same (O Lord) to thy dread Father, in full satisfaction and remedy of all my euils. I pray thee grant mee that with my heart I may deserue to drinke, and with the tongue of my soule to licke y• precious drops of thy Diuine blood, that I may taste there how sweete thy Spirit is, and how sweete that thy most precious liquor is.

I pray thee (O Lord) exalt my spirit, that I may despise all the visible things of this world, and onely looke vpon thee, loue thee, think on nought but thee, sigh after thee, speake of thee, delight in thee, and that all mine actions may bee alwaies in thee, and by thee, and nothing without thee which may saciate my minde.

O blessed were I, if euer I might be so happy, as to deserue to be beheld by thine eies of mercie, wherewith thou didst looke vpon that fortunate theefe; and by the helpe of thy grace I might so innocently liue, that in the end of my life, I were worthy to here that most sweet word, To day shalt thou be with me in Paradise.

               I giue thee thanks, o Lord Iesus 43 Iesus thirsted on the Crosse. Christ, who hauing thy bodie weakned and dried through too grieuous torments, and too much effusion of blood, wert vehemently drie: and burning with excessiue desire of our saluation, saidst, I thirst: Grant me, o Lord, yt I may ardently thirst after thine honor, & the saluation of al soules: herein let me wholly conforme my selfe to thy holy will, doing as much as lieth in mee, in respect of my profession: I pray thee that no loue of transitory things may intangle me: that no creature may draw me into perilous snares, but that I may loue all things for thy sake, which ought to bee loued, and thy selfe more than all, that in thee alone I may onely finde rest.

Yet (O Lord) there are many things which yet I want, for nothing is presently reduced from his not being, to his perfect being: but all things tend to their perfection by certaine degrees: And that perfection, from whom is it to bee required, but from him who is the beginner of this worke? Hence it is that all effects are conuerted to their causes, that they may receiue their finall perfection from thence whence they had their beginning. So see I (O Lord) the plants labour & wrest themselues on euery side, that they may behold the Sun, & fasten their roots in the earth: Fishes forsake not the water: and the Chicken scarce hatched from the egge, hides himselfe vnder the wings of the Hen, and followeth her whither soeuer shee go.

To whom do the times of yeares, moneths, and daies, varie and admit measure, but for me? I wil ascend higher: it was thy will that those noble and pure Angelicall spirits, who minister vnto thee & assist thee, should bee my ministers also, that they might defend me from the assaults of al mine enemies, visible and inuisible, induce mee to goodnesse by their suggestion, helpe me in my tribulations, offer my prayers vnto thee, and bring my soule departing out of this life to thy presence.
               
                  
Arise now my soule, arise, number if thou canst, all these benefits wherwith God ceasseth not to follow thee, though a sinner euerie day. All and euery one of these are certaine voyces inuiting thee to prayse this thy bountifull benefactor. Doest thou not heare, nor know who he is, who insinuateth himselfe vnto thee by so many arguments? makes himselfe known by so many testimonies? draweth thee vnto him by so many rewards? esteemed thee so much, yt hee made all things for thy vse? who is made the shepheard of thy flocke? ye steward of thy houshold? ye Physition of thy bodie & soule? wilt thou not loue him? wilt thou not serue him? wilt thou not giue him thanks? wilt thou not prayse him?
               I desire to prayse thee, O Lord, & giue thee thanks with my whole heart, but in my selfe I finde no means how I may do it: for praise is not seeming in the mouth of a Eccles. 15. sinner. But for that thou hast created all things to my vse & seruice, I will cal vpon all creatures, that

they with me may praise the Lord of al things, saying: O alye works of the Lord, blesse yee with mee the Lord, praise him and magnifie his name for euer.

Because thou madst mee, O Lord, I owe my selfe vnto thee: but for that thou redeemedst mee, I should owe thee farre more than my self, if I had it. But wher as thou couldst not helpe vs by thy life, yet was it thy pleasure to effect the same in thy death, to the end thou mightest expresse vnto vs, the

force of thy loue: for lesse hadst thou loued, except for a time thou hadst sustained, to the end thou mightest disburden vs. And so much more worthily art thou to bee honoured by vs, by how much more greater things thou hast sustained for our sakes. For who art thou that sufferest? what, & of what kinde are the things thou sufferest? for whom sufferest thou? and why sufferest thou? Tell me, O Lord, that I may counterpoise equallie this wonderfull worke & incomparable benefite. What therefore, O my God, shall I say that thou art? I will say yt which yu thy selfe saidst to Moses in times past: Thou art that thou art: Thou art an infinite being that proceedest from no man but thy selfe: and without thee, there is no being that hath being of himselfe, but from thee onely, who art that beginning and fountaine of al being. Thou of thy omnipotent power, madst al things of nothing, thou of thy goodnesse, conseruest all things without any forraine helpe: thou by thy will (if it so pleased thee) maiest reduce al things to

nothing: thou onely art, that art, and all that seemeth to be, is nothing in comparison of thee. The moone shineth not, and the starres are not cleane in thy sight. All beautie compared to thee is deformitie, all power infirmity, all wisdome ignorance, and all goodnesse is malice. Thou art good without defect: wise without error, liberall without acception of persons, iust without wrath, cleane without detriment: thou workest all things, and art not distracted, thou labourest, and art not wearie: thou art euerie where, and nothing is wanting in thee.
               What therfore shal I speake of the greatnes of thy maiesty? Thou beholdest the earth, and makest it P

On the eight day thou tookest on thee the marke of a sinner: Presently after this, the world persecuted thee: thou fledst to forraine Lands, and to a Nation honouring idols, and to that purpose soughtst the silence of the night: the innocency of thy

They spake against thee who sate in the gate, and the drunkards made Ballads of thee. In a Psal. 68. word, thy life was tormented in so

vnworthy sort, as that thou maiest iustly say with the Prophet, I am poore, & in labours from my youth Psal. 87. and infancie.
               These were the things thou sustainedst in thy life time, but greater are they which thou sufferedst in thy death and on the Crosse: There was liberty, takē prisoner: innocency, strooken: beauty, spit vpon: iustice, condemned: glorie, deluded: and life, slaine and crucified. Good Lord, what more admirable? what more horrible? what more strange? Life dieth, God is whipt: the power of God tied with cords: the image of the Father spit vpon: finally, naked God is nailed to a Crosse, and hanged betweene two theeues, in the sight of the whole world. Further may not my soule wade: my strēgth is weak ned, & my heart faileth within mee. O height of charity! O depth of immasurable humilitie! O greatnesse of mercie! O incomprehensible & bottomlesse pit of bounty! If I owe thee so much, O Lord, for yt thou hast redeemed me, what shall I owe thee, for yt after so admirable

a manner, and so hard and difficult vnto me, thou hast redeemed me? O most mercifull Pastor! O most faithfull shepheard, who gauest thy life for thy sheepe, whom thou tookest vpon thee to defend and keepe, with what duty may I remunerate so great a benefite? wt what teares may I prosecute my plaints? with what life shal I imitate thy pure and immaculate life? Truly I owe thee farre more, O Lord, for thy sufferance wherby I was redeemed, than for thy worke by which I was created.
               And if, O Lord, thou hadst sustained these things for Angels or archangels, for cherubins or seraphins, it were lesse to be wondred at: but now hast yu not suffred for these, but for man: & what is man yt thou art mindfull of him, or the sonne of man yt after this sort yu visitest him? If thou consider his bodie, man is the most wretched of al liuing creatures: if his manners, more miserable and worser. Dost thou therefore, O God, die for the sonnes of Satan, for y• corrupters of all honesty & iustice? for parricides

and breakers of thy diuine Lawes? for contemners of thy Maiesty, and blasphemers of thy glory? Dost yu then die, O God; for thy infernall tormentor, whose heart is not allured by benefits, nor terrified by threatnings, nor mollified by promises, nor moued by punishments? For a man who is not content wt his own power and domesticall malice, compasseth the earth also, sorteth out all ye worse sensualities, putteth on ye nature of beasts: becoming woorse than they: crueller than a Tyger, fiercer than a Liō: greedier thā a Wolfe: venomouser than a Toad: craftier than a Serpent. Which not sufficing him, hee descendeth into hell, and borroweth whatsoeuer detestable things, in the diuels themselues: as blasphemy, pride, enuie, and perpetuall hardnesse of heart.

My heart faileth mee in considering thy mercies O God, & there is no more spirit left in me.
               Because I haue once begunne, I will speake vnto thee my King & my God, though I am dust and ashes: Genes 18. What mooued thy mercifull heart? What ouercame and conquered the same, that thou sufferedst so much for so abhominable a creature? didst thou hunt after profite? didst thou expect greater glory and blessednesse, than thou hadst? O meere grace! O loue wt
                  out respect! O pure and sincere goodnesse! What profite hast thou by the seruice of one poore Ant? Psal. 15. What fruit was there expected to thee by the saluation of man? Thou hast no neede of riches. Who gaue thee, that yu mightst restore Iob 41. againe vnto him? all things vnder the heauens are thine.
               
                  
What hadst thou therefore to do with our dolours and miseries? Through the bowels of the mercy of our God, thou didst visit vs, rising from on high. O pittifull bowels! O sweet bowels! O bowels vnto vs the Sea of loue and mercy! In these bowels, and not mooued either with profite or necessity, thou tookest compassion on our griefes and hadst mercie vpon vs: Thou sawest the affliction of thy people, and appearedst in the bush amongst thornes and bryers, discending from Heauen, and taking on thee our nature.
               Be not angry, o Lord, if I speak: If the force of thy loue were so great, thou fountaine of charitie, that it compelled thee to a marriage so vnworthy thy maiestie, that thou wouldst espouse thy selfe to thy creature: was there not a more noble spouse for thee on the earth, and more allied to thee by grace and nature? Why didst thou not rather entertaine the Angelicall nature? why didst thou loue a wife of an vncircumcised nation, which shall afterward betray thee to thine

enemies and kill thee? what doest thou answer mee my God? what doest thou answer? but, I would haue this, this was pleasing in my fight as

How can it bee that there should bee any one in this world that should not loue thee? how can hee bee vnmindfull of such a benefit?

For Oseas, 1. during the time that I liued in the land of Obliuion, and in the shaddow of death, when my waies were most wicked and contrary vnto thee: then did thy mercie call mee, not onely flying, but also repugning: then gauest thou me thy holy Spirit, & adoptedst mee for thy sonne.

permittting timelesse death to apprehend mee. O altitude of thy iudgements! O greatnesse of thy

Ah what had become of me if at that time thou hadst summoned me likewise before thy iudgement seat? What account could I haue made in so miserable an estate? O my mercy & my redemption: I giue thee no lesse thanks for this bounty, than if yu hadst acquited me being condemned amongst those damned, and deliuered mee from perpetuall torments.

I did sinne, and thou didst recall me from finne: I did flie from thee, as though it had bene a slight matter to lose thee: and thou didst seeke me, as though it were much for thy profit to finde me out. So many yeares did wee liue wrastling & resisting, thou in doing good, I in doing euill, and contemning thy goodnesse. With these voices didst thou call mee, with these cords didst thou drawe mee.
               At length when it pleased thee to single me out, and to call me by thy grace, thou sentest a great cry into the eares of my soule, wherwith as it were the roaring of a Lion, thou didst awake mee from sleepe, and

thou calledst me from death vnto life: This is the voice which Dauid thy friend so highly commendeth, Psal.

               O how many and how great are the benefits, which together with this one, are powred into vs? here is giuen pardon of sinnes: grace is giuen, charity is giuen with those other vertues which attend her: finally the gifts & graces of ye holy Spirit are giuen. Heereby the sinner is reconciled vnto thee: of an enemy, made a friend: and of the slaue of the diuell, thy Sonne, and the heire of thy kingdome. Heere the Prodigall Sonne is entertained into his Fathers house: the first Robe, Ring, and Shooes, & Luke, 15. ornaments of a Sonne are restored vnto him.
               And although I cannot be assured, O Lord, whether I be worthy

of hate or loue: yet hope I y• same and confidently euery way trust in thy bounty: my conscience likewise beareth mee witnesse, that I am partaker of the grace of iustification, for which I acknowledge my selfe deepely indebted. Blessed bee thou therefore O bountifull Lord, the giuer of all goodnes, yea of thy selfe, for that I liuing most lasciuiously, thou gauest mee thy holy Spirit for my nurse, tutor, master, gouernour, comforter, and all my good: hee is to mee the pattent of adoption, the pledge of matrimonie, & the assurance of euerlasting life. Blessed bee the day in which such a guest entered my soule: and blessed bee the houre in which the gates of my wal were opened to receiue him. That day was holy vnto mee: in that day I came out of Egypt: that day was my birth day, in which I was regenerated into the Son of God. This my Easter day, in which I rose againe from death to life: in which I receiued the holy Ghost.
               Let Iob curse the day of his natiuitie, Iob. 3. Luke, 15. I will blesse this: this is ye

This is that day in which thou my Father doest acknowledge mee thy sonne, and thy Sonne termeth mee his brother: and thy holy Spirit hath consecrated mee for his Temple: and the Quire of Angels haue saluted me for their companion and fellow Citizen. If on this day the Angels reioyced and sung vnto thee, O Lord, how can my lips bee shut? how may my tongue be silent? how can my mouth choose but bee

                   or Prophets sung of the comming of my Redeemer, all y• will I sing vnto thee, O Lord.
               It was a great benefite of thine O Lord, that thou diddest create me: for thereby thou didst produce me from not being, to a being: but much more is it, that thou iustifiedst me: for in this thou tookst frō
                  
me the being of sinne, and bringest me to the being of grace: in that, am I made the son of man: in this am I adopted the son of God. It is a great benefite which I expect of glory, but no lesse in this kinde is that of iustificatiō. For it is no lesse to make a iust man of a sinner, than of a iust man a blessed man, since there is a greater distance betwixt sin & grace, than betweene grace and glory. Great also, yea very great is ye benefite of redemption: but what had redemption profited, if vocation and iustification had not followed? I acknowledge therefore, O Lord, yt the benefite of iustification is the keie and ground of all the other, without which the rest do not onely not profite, but giue vs matter of greater damnation.
               But (O Lord) what did I vnto thee, that thou shouldst giue mee those things? what obedience shewd I to thee, that thou shouldst giue me this blessing? what foundest thou in me worthy of so great honour & reward? nothing in mee was free frō sin: I knew thee not:

I loued thee not, I serued thee not: neither had thee in remembrance. I became ye bottomlesse pit of darknes and iniquity. I cannot choose (O Lord) but tremble with horror, as oftē as I think hereon: neither finde I any other cause of this benefite, but thy bounty. How many were my companions of the same age, nature, and impietie, of whom I was the most reprobate? yet tookest thou me vnto thee, and forsookest them: we were detained in the same Egyptian captiuitie, & thou admittedst mee to thy royall Table, but condemnedst them, & cast out their flesh to bee deuoured by the creatures of hell.
               Whilst I remember these things, O Lord, my spirit is no more in me: and I know not how to praise thee, or what thanksgiuing to offer vnto thee for so incomparable a benefite. All the time of my life I will say, O Lord, what sawest thou in me: O Lord, what sawest thou in mee? Lord, what sawest thou in mee, more than in the rest whom thou hast forsaken? Why didst thou so call mee? so deliuer

mee? so looke vpon me? so succour me? (if so bee thou hast succoured me) leauing the rest in sinne, who were lesse euil than I? I know not what to say, I know not what to do, I know not what to yeeld vnto thee O Lord, for all the benefits thou hast bestowed on mee. I will with the Prophet, praise my Lord at all times: his praise shall be alway

                  ured: and being an enemie vnto thee, reconciled: redeemed from captiuity, and called from death to life: and of thy fatherly goodnesse hast hitherto conserued me in this state, and as yet doest conserue me by thy grace.
               Thou art he onely, O Lord, yt created me, & made mee of nought: and thou onely art he that conseruest that which thou hast created: thou bountifully dost protect that essence of nature which thou gauest me, lest it should perish. Thou onely hast regenerated mee by thy Spirit in the life of grace. By thee are we priuiledged from our sins: by thee are wee conserued, lest wee should fall againe into sinne. If at any time I haue risen, thou gauest me thy hand: if I now stand, thou sustainest me, lest I fall. As many good purposes as I haue conceiued: as many godly inspiratiōs as I haue felt: all are by thy benefite. As oftē as I haue ouercome mine enemy, as oftē as I haue refrained my euill inclinations and peruerse

appetites, it was thy benefite. For if no man can say, Lord Iesu, but in ye holy Spirit, nor doe any good deede without thee, euen as the branch can yeeld no fruite being deuided from the vine: sure it is, that if any fruite grow from this cluster, it is by the benefite of that vine to which it cleaueth.
               If at any time I haue fasted, it came from thee: if I haue endured aduersity patiently, thou didst assist me: if at any time I haue denied mine owne will, it was thy working: If euer hitherto I haue shed the teares of contrition, if my prayers haue preuailed with thee, I confesse (O Lord) that I did it by thy helpe, I confesse that thou hast wrought all good workes in me: for all theese doe I giue thee thanks. I referre al these benefits with thanksgiuing to him from whom they proceeded, that hereafter they may flow more plentifullie. I acknowledge my selfe to bee indebted for so many benefits, as I haue done duties to thee, O Lord, in this life, if I haue done any at all.

What shall I say of the occasions and opportunities offered by thee vnto me of good life? How many preachers hast thou sent to teach me? how many counsellers to instruct me? how many good friends, how many godly companions, how many good examples, how many deuout bookes hast thou lent mee, by whose helps I am incited to goodnesse, and pricked forward to vprightnes of life? Great are these thy benefits, but greater doth he owe thee, who hath profited without these: blessed is hee whom thou hast taught, O Lord, and instructed in thy law: for so Psal. 94. much more hath hee profited, by how much thou art a better Doctor, and wiser Master then others.
               But who can recount the perils and dangers from whence thou hast deliuered mee, O bountifull shepheard of mens soules? or the sinnes whereinto I had fallen wt
                  out thine assistance? There is no sin so great, that was euer attempted by man, which another man cannot fall into, if the Creator bee

wanting by whom he is made. For whi

All men acknowledge not these thy benefits, but I through the grace doe both acknowledge & embrace them. How often, O louing Father, hast thou vsed this mercy towards mee? How often hast thou bound the enemies hands, lest he should tempt me? or if he should haue tempted me, that yet hee might not ouercome mee? how often hast thou inchanted that old Serpent, yt although I walked amongst Uipers & Bas

                  lisques, yet could they not hurt me▪ How often hast thou trauelled with mee through water & fire, lest I should bee burned in the flame, or drowned in the water? How often in the

midst of the seruants of this world hast thou tempered the flame of this Babylonicall furnace with ye dew of the holy Spirit, and so cooled it that it might not consume me? How often might I iustly say with the Prophet: I was thrust fore at y• I might fal? But y• Lord Psal. 118. was my helpe? If at any time I haue stood, I stood by thee: if I haue fallen, I haue fallen by my selfe: & thy hand hath staied me vp, lest I shold be bruised. Yea I had alwaies lien in y• dirt, except thou hadst raised me. In the multitude of my sorrowes therefore which I had in my heart, thy comforts haue Psal. 94. refreshed my soule, and raised it.
               How often, O Lord, haue my sins deserued thy wrath? How often mightst thou haue taken thy hand away, and that iustly from mee, as thou hast withdrawne it from others lesse vngratefull? yet wert y• mercifull vnto mee, and didst not punish me according to my iniquities? I was proud, swolne with vaine glory, I attributed that glorie which was due vnto thee, to my selfe: and therefore I am worthy to

bee an outcast from thy mercie. I was ingrateful, I did not acknow ledge thy benefits: I attributed that to nature which was due to the author of nature: neither did I yeeld the thanks which belonged vnto thee: I was negligent & slothfull in those things which appertaine to my saluation: and therefore I deserued that my talēt should long since haue bene taken from me. I was rash in louing perils, and therefore worthy to fall into them.
               I am worthy I say, O Lord, y• for these and many such like, I should alreadie bee forsaken and

               I conuert the dolors of my conscience, O Lord, wherewith I should be vexed, if thou hadst forsaken mee, into ioy: and now with glad minde and reioycing spirit, in way of thanksgiuing and praise I sing, saying with thy friend: Returne my soule into thy rest, for our Lord hath done good vnto thee. For he Psal. 116. hath deliuered my soule frō death, mine eies from teares, and my feet from falling. For all these thy benefits, we yeeld thee thanks Lord God omnipotent, who art, and hast bene, and who shalt be: for thy Apoc. 11. & 15. works are great and wonderfull, and thy waies are iust and true, Lord and King for euer.

Hee hath bent his bow, and hath to that end prepared his shafts, that he may wound mee sodainely: he hath said he would hide his snares, saying: Who shall see them? which way soeuer I see thē, there is no security: the flesh suggesteth me with delight, the world presenteth sweete, the diuell gall: the flesh talketh vnto me of sleepe, of drinke, of meat, and such like appurtenances of the same: the world bewitcheth mee with ambitious pleasing of time, with boasting, with arrogancy, and pride: but to wrath, malice & bitternes of minde, the diuell prouoketh me.

Who shall stand against so strong an enemie? (O Lord.) Who shall sustaine his assaults? He stirreth vp vnlawful motions, venemous cogitatious.

It inflameth, moueth war, nourisheth hatred, inciteth gourmandise, quickeneth lust, prepareth occasions of sinne, and ceasseth not with a thousand subtilties of circumuention, to driue away the spirit. It is a grieuous conflict, & a dangerous war to fight against a home-bred enemie, especially where we are strangers, and hee a Citizen: he dwelleth in his owne countrey, wee are pilgrimes and strangers.

               Amen.
            
            
               Against remembrance of iniuries.
               O Lord, of thy goodnesse fill our hearts with thy peace, & clense vs from all euill cogitations and vncleannesse, and from all memorie of iniuries, and from all enuy, and mind of mischiefe which bringeth

death. O Lord, make vs all worthy to salute one another with a holy and immaculate salutation: and graunt that wee may receiue without iudgement and death, thy heauenly gift, that is, thy grace, with the holy Spirit,
               Amen.
            
            
               Against wrath.
               HOw much error breedeth this blind indulgence of our selues in our minds, that we esteeme that to be done vniustly, which is done most vprightly: yt in those things wee denie pardon vnto others, in which wee our selues euerie houre are faulty and want pardon: yt wee challenge to our selues a reuenge being children, mad, furious & vniust: and take it from him, who is only wise and iust: who in respect of his wisedome, is deficient in nothing, and in regard of his equitie seduceth no man from the truth.
               O most mercifull Christ, example of modesty, fountain of meekenesse, 
                     〈◊〉
                   into vs some part of this thy lenitie, whereby in imitation

of thy humility, being assailed with railings, affected with iniuries, oppressed and afflicted with slanders and reproofes, yet that we may reward good for euill.
            
            
               Against enuie.
               THou, O Lord, art the founder and maker of all things: thou art the dispenser of thy mercies, which thou by thy immeasurable liberality bestowest on men, yeelding euery one more than hee deserueth, and defrauding no man of that which is sufficient for him: What cause therefore haue we to enuy thee, when as thou bestowest thy liberality vpon al men of thine owne, and art bountifull to those that deserue it not, and giuest to euery one that which sufficeth him for his beatitude?
               O Father, adde this also to ye rest of thy benefits, that we may submit to thy iudgement, and satisfie our selues with thy 
                     •…
                  stributions: that we may giue thee thanks for those things which wee haue receiued.

And for those things yt thou hast bestowed on others, grant that secretly we condemne not thy holy will, and vnsearchable iudgement: but rather that in other mens blessings, wee may loue and laud thy munificence, who art so bountifull vnto all men, wanting of thy selfe nothing, neither receiuing any thing from any man, neither hoping any thing.
               Amen.
            
            
               In extreme troubles and persecutions.
               O Lord God that deliueredst ye honest matron Susanna from false iudgement, at such time as she was reprochfully circumuented by slander: that keptst Daniel thy prophet in the denne of Lyons, and preseruedst the three children in the flaming furnace: that deliueredst Peter ready to be deuoured by the sea, & swallowed in the waues thereof, by the might of thy right hand: I beseech thee, O most mercifull God, that thou wilt redeeme and deliuer both me thy vnworthy

seruant, & all other christian people, out of these miseries and calamities wherewith wee are circumuented. Spare thy people, I beseech thee, whom thou hast redeemed by thy precious blood, keepe this natio

                   and people redeemed by so precious a ransome, in peace, mutuall concord, and coniunction, to the glory of thy holy name.
               Amen.
            
            
               In the time of warre amongst Christians.
               O Lord, Father of mercies, God of peace and dilection, how long, I pray thee, wilt thou be angry with thy christian people? punishing them with erecrable wars, and vtter ouerthrows. Behold the affliction and extreme extinction of thy people & nations. Heare the groanes of the poore, let the christian blood moue thee vnto mercy.
               Ah las, O Lord, these are truly yt iust punishments of our sins: wee haue sinned, wee haue done wickedly, we haue left thee ye fountaine of life & our felicitie, we haue contemned

thee, mocked thee, and with an obstinate minde made war by our sins, against thy commandements: wee haue kept none of thy testimonies, of which thou hast said: If you shall keepe them, they shal keepe you: if you dispise them, Esay, 1. the sword shall consume you. But thou (O Lord) notwithstanding thou art iustly displeased, remember thee of thy mercies: and to the end we may be made capable therof, giue vnto thy people I beseech thee the knowledge and confession of their wicked liues: powre vpon them the spirit of thy grace and of prayer, that euery where with a contrite and humble heart (which thou despisest not) they may crie vnto thee, saying: O Lord haue mercie, O Lord haue mercy vpon thy people, whom thou hast redeemed with thy precious blood: wee haue sinned, we haue done vniustly. Thy iudgements are iustly vrged against vs: prostrating our selues, we call vpon thy grace and mercie, to the end that thy reuenging hand may be appeased.
               Put (o Lord) thy cruell and deuouring

sword into thy sheath, command the euill beasts, that is, all those things which giue cause of warre, to returne vnto their place: & leaue most holsome peace long desired amongst Christians, safely to reigne amongst them, to the praise & glory of thy most holy name, who strikest, and healest,

               In the time of plague.
               WE know, O Lord God and most iust Father, that the rebellion almost of all creatures against man onely is very great, whom (if all things were disposed according to the order of creatiō) they ought to obey and acknowledge: Now earthquakes, now thunders, now inundations, now most fatal coniunctions of Stars, now the infection of the aire, and daily new and other kinde of euils are heard of. But this punishment falleth vpon vs, because wee abuse the giftes of thy munificence, transgresse thy commaundemenis,

for that we are not terrified with threatrungs, nor allured by promises.
               We acknowledge that by these thy chastisements thou drawest vs from these earthly affaires, and inuitest vs to heauenly destres, and that for this cause thy creatures are obedient vnto thee. Bee than mindfull in this thy wrath, of thy great mercy: and fauourably take away this contagious sickenesse, which by thy wrath is powred vpon vs. For the pestilent aire shall enforce no euill, if we oppose our selues against all kinds of iniquity: yet all things proceede from thee, O most mercifull Father. both for that in body wee are secured from this plague, and for that in soule wee are protected from the venome of sinne, and reward thereof.

O Lord, let thy hand I pray thee be turned, that all the earth may know that thou art the Lord our GOD, and that thy Name is called vpon 2. Reg. 24. amongst vs.

               In the time of famine and scarsity of victuals.
               MOst iust Lord God, that according to the merits of thy people, both bestowest and withdrawest thy blessings: looke vpon our pouerty, who acknowledge this present scarsitie of victuals & famine, as a rod in thy hand, wherby thou chastisest and punishest y• manifold abuses of thy blessings, misimployed by vs in riot, and often drunkennes, and other destres of the flesh, and dissipations of thy gifts which thou hast giuen vs, not to that intent, that being fa

               But what other thing shall wee most wretched sinners (iustly puni shed by thee for our iniquities) do,

but falling downe prostrate in the presence of thy Maiestie, accuse our selues, and deplore our offenses, and implore thy grace and mercy: that thou wilt vouchasafe to looke downe from Heauen, to the end, that by thy blessing, our land may yeeld vs increase: and by that meanes releeued and satisfied with necessary food, we may praise thee for the blessings wee haue receiued, & professe our selues more and more bound to do thee seruice.
               Amen.
            
            
               Against the tempests and thunder of the aire.
               KIng of eternal glory, omnipotent God, that giuest food vnto all creatures, and couerest the heauen with clouds, and preparest raine for the earth, that transferrest the Southerne winde from y• heauen, and bringest in the Affricke by thy vertue: that waterest the mountaines from the higher places thereof, & who satiatest the earth with the fruite of thy works:

that hast commanded thine Angel, that he should not hurt neither Apoc. 9. the land nor the Sea, nor trees: spare those that feare thee, and bee mercifull to their prayers.
               For wee most humbly beseech thee, O Lord, that y• incursion of stormes may depart far from vs, and the calamity of tempests, the tempest of haile, the blasting of lightning, and that all the assaults of the enemie may bee tempered. Let the harmefull thunders, the noisome raines, the raging wmdes be calmed, grant also that the right hand of thy vertue may ouer-way the spirits of storme and airie tempests.
               O Lord, thou that thunderest from heauen, and giuest thy voice, Psalm. 17. that sendest forth thine arrowes, & multipliest thy lightnings: turne away we pray thee, this cruel tempest from vs, let it not bring vs to confusion. Restraine the thunder and thine arrowes, lest they hurt vs. keepe vs and our houses, lest we perish through yt fury of storme and the force of lightning: Protect our habitations, lest by fire sent
