            To the Reader. To all them that either reade or heare gods holy worde / and geue ouer them ſelues to lyue vnfannedly acording to the ſame / do I hartely wyſſhe the grace / peace and mercy of god the father in and thorow oure lorde and onely Sauioure Ieſus Chriſt.
            THe ſeuenth daye of Decembre / was delyuered vnto me a certayne treatyſe / compoſed by one Iohn Standiſh Felow of Whittington college in londō (ſo is the tytle of it) and prynted by Robert Redeman / Anno M. D. XL. iij. Nonas Octobris. At the reading wherof I mourned ſore within my ſelfe for certayne occaſions offred vnto me in the ſande treatyſe. Firſt that vnder the Kynges priuilege any thing ſhuld be ſet forth / which is either agaynſt the worde and trueth of allmightye god / or agaynſt the Kynges honoure. Secondlye / that good / wholſome / and Chriſten wordes ſhulde be calumpniated and reuyled. Thirdly / that the ſayde Iohn Standiſh pronouncyng Doctoure Barnes to haue taught hereſye ſo longe / is not aſhamed all this whyle to haue hold his penne / but now firſt to wryte agaynſt him / whan he is deed. et ce.
            As touching the firſt / whether I haue cauſe to mourne or no / I reporte me to all true Chriſten hertes. for (as I am credibly enfourmed / Diuerſyte amonge wryters. and as I partly haue ſene) there is now a wonderful diuerſite in writing bokes and balates in England

/ one enueyenge agaynſt another / one reuylinge and reprouyng another / one reioyſinge at anothers fall and aduerſite. And not onely this / but alſo at the ende of euery balate or boke in maner (whether it be the better partye or worſe) is ſet the Kynges priuilege. Which as it is agaynſt the glorye of god that one ſhulde reuyle another / Is it not euen ſo agaynſt the Kynges honoure (Yee the ſhame is it of all Englande) that vnder his priuilege anye erroneous / contentious / or ſlaunderous boke or papyre ſhulde be prynted? Men wonder in other contrees / that ther is ſo greate negligence of this matter / in a realme where ſo wyſe and prudent a counſail is▪ And they that are moued with godly compaſſiō / do lament Englande. ſory / that ther is ſo great diſcencion in it.Tryfles are prynted with the Kynges priuilege / vnknowing to him. ſory / that blaſphemous ieaſting / and raylinge balates or bokes agaynſt the manifeſt worde of god / ſhulde either be ſuffred or priuilegied. ſory / that gods trueth ſhulde thus ſpitefully be intreated of ſo greate a nombre. Now the reformacion of this and all other defaultes lyeth onely in the hande of god / To whom I referre it / and to the rightfull admyniſtracion of his holy ordinaūce and auctorite in the kynges hyghneſſe. who / whan he knoweth of the ſaide inconuenience (how tryflinge and raylinge bokes and rymes are prynted vnder his priuilege) wyll no doubte ſet a redreſſe herein.
            Concernyng the ſeconde occaſion aboue rehearced

Is it not cauſe ynough forme and all other Chriſten / to be right ſory / to mourne and lamente / that the wordes which are good / wholſome / and acordinge to the holy ſcripture and Chriſies faith / ſhulde be either blaſphemed or taken to the worſt? Yf the Kynges grace / ſhulde put forthe an wholſome proclamacion / iniunction or commaundement (as he doth many) what true ſubiecte louynge gods holy ordinaunce and auctorite in his prynce / wold not be greue to ſe anye man either ſpytt at thoſe his ſoueraignes wordes / or to defye them? Yf we now which are Chriſten / haue ſo iuſt occſion (and are bownde) to be thus wiſe mynded in this outward regiment / wherein god hath appoynted us to be obedient to the hyer powers / how much more cauſe haue we to water our eyes with ſory hertes / whan the proclamacion / iniunction / Good wordes are blaſphemed. cōmaundement and worde of him which is kyng of all Kynges and lord of all lordes / is thus reuyled and euell ſpoken of? That the wordes of. D. Barnes ſpoken at tbe houre of his death / and here vnder written / are good / wholſome / acording to gods holy ſcripture / and not worthy to be euell taken / It ſhalbe euidently ſene / whan we haue layed thē to the twych ſtone / and tryed them by gods worde. To the open text wherof yf ye take good hede / ye ſhal ſe the peruerſe doctryne and wycked opynions of Standiſh clerely confuted. And (no doubte) god wyll ſo haue it / becauſe that vnder the pretence

of bearing a zeale toward gods worde / he taketh apon him to be iudge and geuer of ſentence agaynſt gods worde / and to condemne it that gods worde aloweth.
            And this (as I ſayde) is another cauſe of the ſoryneſſe of my hert / that he which darre auowe another man to be an opē heretike / is not aſhamed thus longe nether to haue written / ner openly preached agaynſt him by name / but now to ſtarte vp whan he is deed. Is it not a greate worſhippe for him to wreſtle with a ſhadow / and to 
                  ••

                  yll a deed man. and whan mē are deed / then draweth out his ſwerde / and fighteth with them that are ſlayne allreadye? Iudge ye (gentle readers) yf Standiſh playeth not ſuch a parte with D. Barnes / To whom alſo he imputeth treaſon / and yet proueth neuer a poynte therof agaynſt him. Yet were it as charitable a dede to confute all treaſon and to geue us warnynge of it by name / as either to eſtabliſhe falſe doctryne / or to enueye agaynſt good ſayenges. Yee a Chriſten and charitable acte were it in reprouyng anye traytoure / to tell the Kynges ſubiectes in what thing he committed the treaſon / that they maye beware of the ſame. But thus doth not Standiſhe here in this his treatiſe / which becauſe it is buylded on ſande and on a falſe foundaciō / I doubte not / but with gods worde (which is the ſwerde of the ſprete / Ephe. vj.
               
and a weapen mighty / to ouerthrow euery ymaginacion that exalteth it ſelfe agaynſt the knowlege of god) To geue it a fall / ij. Corin. x. and with holy ſcripture to ſhewe euydently / that Standiſhe hath farre ouerſhott himſelfe / in condemnynge the ſayenges which gods word doth not diſalowe. He that wolde wryte agaynſt anye man / ſhulde leuell his ordinaunce agaynſt his euell wordes (yf he had ſpoken or written anye) and not agaynſt his good wordes. ffor god is the authoure of all good / which as his holy ſcripture aloweth / ſo will he himſelfe defende the ſame. He that is therfore an enemye to the thinge which is good / or reſiſteth it / is gods aduerſary / and withſtondeth him. Wherfore let Standiſh frō henſforth and all other beware / Let no man take parte agaynſt the trueth. that they take no parte agaynſt gods worde / ner defende any falſe matter / leſt god be the auenger. ffor yf the lyon begynne to roare / he will make all his enemies afrayed.
            And yf. D. Barnes dyed a true Chriſten man / be ye ſure / his death ſhalbe a greater ſtroke to ypocriſye / then euer his life coulde haue bene. Yf he was falſly accuſed to the Kynges highneſſe / and ſo put to death / woo ſhall come to thoſe accuſers / yf they repent not by tymes. And yf D. Barnes in his hert / mouth and dede / committed no worſe thinge towarde the Kynges highneſſe / then he committed agaynſt god in theſe his wordes at his death / he is like at the later daye to be a iudge ouer them / that were cauſe of his death yf they do not amende.
            
               Now (indifferent reader) to the intent that thou mayeſt the more clearly / diſcerne light frō darkneſſe / and knowe gods true worde from falſe docrine / I ſhall (whan I haue ſayde ſomwhat to Standiſh preface) rehearce vnto the. D. Barnes wordes. Secondly though I rehearce not vnto the all Standiſh wordes (leſt I ſhuld make to greate a boke) I ſhall poynte the to the begynning of his ſentence / requyring the (yf thou wilt) to reade out the reſt thy ſelfe in his treatiſe. Thirdly though he hath deſſerued to be roughly handled / yet do I purpoſe (by gods onely grace) to deale more gently with him beynge alyue / then he doth with the deed. This interpryſe now as I take in hand agaynſt Standiſhe in this behalfe / ſo am I ready to do the ſame agaynſt the greate graundſire and captaine of falſe teachers / I meane greate Goliath of Rome and his weapen-bearer. That is / agaynſt all ſuch as are enemies to Kynge Dauid oure lorde Ieſus Chriſt / for whoſe mooſt confortable ſprete (gentle reader) I beſeche the to praie with me vnto our mooſt deare father in heauen / whoſe name be prayſid / whoſe kyngdome come / whoſe onely wyll be fulfilled now and euer Amen.

                     TO ſe the moſt victoryous and noble Prynce oure ſoueraigne lorde the kyng / labourynge and watchinge contynually wyth all diligent ſtudye / to expulſe and dryue out / I maye ſaye / to pourge and clenſe this his catholike regyon / etce.
                  
               
               
                  Couerdale
                  Though ye abuſe youre termes in reporting that the Kyng goeth about to expell and dryue out his catholike region / I will impute thoſe youre wordes to the weakneſſe of youre brayne / and to the ſeaceneſſe of honeſt eloquence therin. But yf the Kynges laboure / watching / and diligent ſtudye in pourging and clenſyng his realme from all hereſies and ſciſmes / be occaſion ſufficient (as it is in dede) to compell euery true ſubiecte to helpe vnto the ſame / why haue ye then bene

ſo ſlack therin all this while? Youre owne wordes bring yo in to a ſhrewd ſuſpicion. For ye knowe and haue ſene with your eyes / Suſpicion. that the kyng hath theſe many yeares bene labouring and buſie in aboliſhing out of his realme the vſurped power of the. B. of Rome / his manifolde ſectes of falſe religions / his worſhipping of ymages / his diſceatfull pardons / his ydolatrye and pilgremages / etc. Were not all theſe / great hereſies and ſciſmes? Or can ye excuſe your ſelfe of ignoraunce / that ye haue not ſene / how the Kyng hath laboured in putting downe the ſame? Yf ye then be a writer againſt hereſies and ſciſmes / why haue ye written agaynſt none of theſe all this while? Thus euery man which readeth your wordes / maye ſe / that ye haue bewraied your ſelfe to be a fauourer of ſuch thinges.
               
               
                  Standiſh.
                  
                     Wherfore / maruayll not (gentle reader) etc.

                  Contrary now to your requeſt / wil euery man maruail at you / not onely becauſe ye declare your ſelfe to haue borne (all this whyle) no ryght loue toward gods word / to the ſaluacion of mens ſoules / ner to the dewtye that ye owe to your prynce / but alſo becauſe that now thorow the

occaſion of a poore mans deeth / ye firſt ſtarte vp to wryte / as though the Kyng had put downe no hereſies afore. D. Barnes dyed. Is this the zele that ye bear toward gods word and towarde his people? Such a zele had they / of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaketh to the Galathians / ſayenge / Gala. 
                           •
                        iij. They haue no good zele vnto you / but wolde thruſt you out (namely from the trueth) that ye might be feruent to them ward. Where as ye write the daye and yeare of. D. Barnes death / it increaſeth your owne confuſion / and ſhall be a cleare teſtimonye agaynſt youre ſelfe / for reſiſtinge thoſe good wordes of his proteſtacion / yf ye forſake not youre hereſye in tyme. Yee euen by youre owne penne haue ye brought it to pas / that it ſhall not be forgotten till the worldes ende / what a Chriſten teſtament and laſt will. D. Barnes made at his death / and how paciently he forſoke this life.

                  For (ſaie ye) in his proteſtaciō / et cet. Is that the cauſe why ye do enterpryſe and take in hande to wryte agaynſt it? Then verely declare ye youre ſelfe not onely to be parcial / but alſo a fauourer

of hereſye and treaſon / knowinge ſo many to haue bene attaynted therof within theſe ſeuen yeares.

                     ALlbeit / do not thynke / that I wryte this thorow anye malyce toward him that is burned etc.

                  He that compareth youre wordes to your dede / ſhall ſoone perceaue / that ye haue caſt milk in youre owne face / and that (for all youre holy pretence) ſome ſpice of Cainiſh ſtomake hath made you now do more / then all the Kynges noble actes in aboliſhinge the ſaide abuſes / coulde make you do many yeares afore / though the ſame (yf ye were a true ſubiecte) were by youre owne confeſſion / ſufficient cauſe for you ſo to do. Howbeit it is not I that go aboute to laye malice to youre charge / youre awne acte is not your beſt frende / I praye god your conſcience accuſe you not therof.
                  But why take ye god to recorde in a falſe matter? Do ye not confeſſe yourſelfe / that the Kynges graces laboure / watchinge and diligent ſtudie is the thinge that cauſeth and compelleth you to write againſt. D. Barnes proteſtacion / and that thorow the loue and feruent zele ye beare towarde

gods word and the ſaluacion of mens ſoules? et cete. And now take ye god to recorde / Standiſh is afrayed. that ye do it for feare / leſt the people ſchulde be infecte

                      the multitude of copies of the ſaide proteſtacion. Againſt the which feare I knowe none other comforte for you (aſ longe as ye will not harken vnto gods worde) but that wiſdome it ſelfe geueth you in Salomons Prouerbes.Prouer. j. Namely / that the thing which ye feare / ſhal come vpon you / and euen it that ye are afrayed of / ſhall fall in ſodenly amonge you. This am I certified of / not onely by the ſame place of ſcripture / but euen by this youre preſent acte in putting forth youre treatiſe to be printed with and againſt the ſaide proteſtaciō. For yf ye feare the great infection of the people thorow the multitude of copies therof / why cauſed ye it to be printed / or any man els for you? Is the printing of the ſaide proteſtacion the nexte waie to kepe copies therof from the people? Ye maie well haue witte / but ſure ye lacke policie Such a like wiſe waie was takē in England within theſe few yeares by certaine abbottes / which thinkyng therby to vpholde their falſe religions / The enemies

And euen ſo now by youre printinge of the ſaide proteſtaciō / ye haue brought it ſo to pas / that the thinge whiche ye feared / is come to light. Thus can god pull downe his enemies

houſes with their owne hondes. Certainlie like as I neuer heard that ther was any copie therof / till I ſawe it in youre boke / ſo am I credibly enfourmed / that it was neuer in printe afore.
                  Where as ye ſaie / that it is an erroneous and traiterous proteſtaciō / it is ſooner ſaide / then proued / nether maketh it greately for youre honeſtie / to knowe many ſecrete embracers of hereſie and treaſon / and not to utter them. But ye maie twiſe ſaie it / afore ye be ones beleued / onely they that are of god / wil whan thei haue tried and examined al thinges / kepe that which is good / and eſchuethe contrary.

                  Here do ye manifeſtly declare / what zele moued you to write againſt. D. Barnes proteſtacion / Namely / not any iuſt zele or loue toward gods worde / or his people / but euen becauſe / ye feare / leſt your mother ſhulde come to ſhame / yf the trueth were knowne / therfore to ſhew youre mother a pleaſure / ye thoughte to do youre beſt in defending

her. Nether helpeth it your pretēce anie thinge at all / though ye call hir holy / All is not gold that ſhyneth. for euery ſuch ſecte as ye be of / hath a ſundrie holineſſe / which commeth not of the ſprete that ſanctifieth. Now like as your owne acte came of that zele which ye beare toward the church of the wicked / ſo wolde ye haue youre treatiſe red with the ſame zele / to the intent that the readers might ſmell hereſie and treaſon / where none is / and be poyſoned with ſuch a corrupte iudgment / as ye be of youre ſelfe.
                  Agayne / how are ye (or all men lyuinge) able to proue / that this proteſtacion of. D. Barnes doth ſmell and ſauoure nothinge but hereſie and treaſon? Is it hereſie and treaſon to teach no erroneous doctrine / to teach onely thoſe thinges that ſcripture leadeth vnto / to manteyne no erroure / to moue no inſurrection / to be falſly ſlaundred / to confute the falſe opinion of the Anabaptiſtes / to deteſte and abhorre all ſuch ſectes / Standiſh ſmelleth here nothinge but hereſy and treaſon. to ſet forth the glory of god / obedience to the hyer powers / and the true religion of Chriſt? Doth it ſmell and ſauoure nothinge but hereſie and treaſon to beleue in the holy and bleſſed trenite / to beleue the incarnacion / paſſiō / death and reſurrection of oure lorde and ſauiour Ieſus Chriſt? Is it hereſye and treaſon for a ſynner to deſire god to forgeue him / to truſt onely in the death of Chriſt / to ſet forth good workes / to beleue that ther is a holy church / to beleue a life after this / to ſpeake reuerently of ſaintes / to call oure lady a virgin immaculate

and vndefiled / to knowlege a Chriſten beleue concerning the body and bloude of oure lorde / to aſcribe vnto ſaintes the honoure that ſcripture willeth them to haue / to praie for the Kyng and his counſaill / et cete. Do ſuch thinges ſmell and ſauoure nothinge but hereſie and treaſon? Wo vnto thē that call good euell / Eſa. v. and euell good darkneſſe light / and light darkneſſe / ſwete ſower / and ſower ſwete.
                  Though ye do alſo eſteme them to be heretikes and traitours / that take parte with. D. Barnes proteſtacion / yet doth not youre eſtimacion or iudgment diſcorage me in this behalfe. Nether is it my minde or will to medle with his offence / (yf he cōmitted anie againſt the Kyng) nether to defende this his proteſtaciō with anie hand or weapen of man / but by the ſcriptures to beare recorde vnto the trueth / and to reproue youre peruerſe and ſtraunge doctrine / which ye do teach againſt the ſame.

Where as he taketh god to recorde in the trueth of ſo waightye a matter / the ſcripture is full of holy enſamples / that beare him therin. What partinacite is there then in that acte?
                  
                     He durſt avowe alſo / that (to his knowlege) he neuer taught anie erroneous doctrine / and yet are ye not aſhamed to aſcrybe partinacite vnto him / and to call him an obſtinate heretike / where as.Who is an heretike. S. Hierome in his fourth boke the xxiiij. chapter vpon Mathew writeth thus. He is an heretike that vnder Chriſtes name teacheth the thinges which are agaynſt Chriſt. Yf. D. Barnes therfore had wittingly and willingy taught anye thing againſt Chriſt / ye might haue laied great partinacite to his charge. Trueth it is / that he beinge in ignoraunce / and diſceaued ſomtime by a multitude as you be / did both erre and teach erroneous doctrine for the preferrement of the. B. of Romes vſurped auctorite and other abuſes / acording as many other lerned men moo in the realme haue done / (which haue ſens both repēted toward god / and alſo receaued the Kynges gracious pardon) many yeares agoo. Againe / yf ye will laie partinacite to his charge becauſe he was ſomtime in ſuch groſſe ignoraunce / Mar. vj.ix. Luc. ij.ix.xviij.

I ſaie not this to excuſe ignoraunce / but to reprehende the raſhneſſe of youre iudgment / which preſume to condemne them whō god hath called to repentaunce.
                  But peraduenture the pertinacite that ye laye to his charge / is becauſe he ſaieth he taught onely thoſe thinges which ſcripture led him vnto. For

that is no ſmall corſie to youre ſore. Ye wolde not haue ſcripture taught onely without other doctrines.Deut. xij. Mat. xxviij Gal. j.ij. Iohn. j. Hiere. xv. Matth. v Neuertheles they that loue gods commaundement / will teach nothinge but his worde onely / for ſo hath he himſelfe geuen cōmiſſion. Of his promiſes is mencion made both in Hieremie and in the goſpell of Matthew. As for enſamples / we haue ſufficiēt both of the Prophetes and Apoſtles / which / to die for it / ij. Cor. xiij. Rom. xv. wold teach nothinge but ſcripture. Reade the thirtēth chapter of the ſeconde Epiſtle to the Corinthians / the fiftenth to the Romaines / and the mooſt godly proteſtacion that. S.

Let us geue place and cōſente to the holy ſcripture (ſaieih. S.De peccatorum meritis et remiſſione cap. xxij. The biſſhoppes of England. Auguſtine) for it can nether diſceaue / ner be diſceaued. The biſſhoppes alſo and clergie of England in the Epiſtle of their boke to the Kynges grace / do affirme / that holy ſcripture alone ſheweth men the right path to come to god / to ſe him / to knowe him / to loue him / to ſerue him / and ſo to ſerue him / as he mooſt deſireth. Wherfore they are rather obſtinate agaynſt god / which in ſteade of his onely worde / preach and teach other doctrines. But let us heare what. D.

                  As for blindneſſe / ye nede no leader to bring you in to it / oure lorde (whan his will is) bringe you out of it. This man toke god to recorde / that he neuer mainteined anye erroure / Wherby like as he denied not but that he might erre (as he did erre groſly / whan he lyued in the Papiſtry) euen ſo lefte he us an enſample / A good enſample in.

And truly like as I am ſure that ye are not Kyng of England / ſo do I perceaue by youre wryting / that ye are none of the Kynges lerned counſail / And ſo (by youre owne confeſſion) none of Chriſtes church. The ordinaunce of Chriſtes church is / that euery one (from the prince to the loweſt ſubiecte) ſhall be diligent to wayte vpon his office / and to do the thinge that god hath called him vnto.

But agaynſt true faſting / wherof mencion is made in many places of holy ſcripture / haue not ye yet proued that. D.

                  Yf ye will blame him for preaching againſt the abuſe of prayer / why do ye not alſo blame the Prophet Eſaye / Eſa. j. Matth. vj.xxiij.

But thankes be vnto god / agaynſt the right vſe of prayer (wherof mencion is made by oure ſauioure and his Apoſtles thorow out the new Teſtament) haue ye not yet proued / that. D.

                  Neuertheles / I maruayll the leſſe that ye blame him vnworthy in this poynte / for ye are not aſhamed alſo to belye him / and to reporte of him / that he denied godly ordinaunce to bynde vnto deedly ſinne / contrary to. S. Paul Roman. xiij.Godly ordinaunce.

                  Where as ye ſaie / that it is the church which hath this auctorite / to reſtrayne the thinges that are fre by the goſpell / I anſwere / The church of Cyriſt is his ſpouſe / and the folde of thoſe ſhepe that harken to his voyce / vnto his voyce (I ſay) and not vnto the voyce of ſtraungers. He him ſelfe alſo ſendinge out his Apoſtles / biddeth them teach all that he hath commaunded them / and not to bynde that he hath made fre / nether to make fre that he hath bownd.

Workes profit not to ſaluation ergo they profit nothing at all / Is this a praty conſequent? Youre conſequent is naught / ſaieth. S.lj. Pet. j.

                  Now to put you to youre probacion. How are ye able iuſtly to proue / that pennaunce is voyde and ſuperfluous / where faith is preached onely to iuſtifie? the true faith of Chriſt / Gal. v. is it that we ſpeak of. Is it not occupied then / and worketh thorow godly loue and charite? They then that duely receaue this faith / do not receaue it to lyue worſe or as euell afterward / as they did afore god gaue it them. For though we be ſaued by grace thorow faith / and that not of our ſelues / Ephe. ij. though it be the gift of god (I ſaie) not of workes / Yet are we his workmanſhippe / created in Chriſt Ieſu vnto good workes / to the which god ordeyned us before / that we ſhulde walke in thē. Nether hath oure ſauioure geuē us anie libertie to receaue it in vayne / ij. Cor. vj.

Therfore who ſo deſpiſeth to lyue vertuouſly / and to do good workes / j. Teſſa. iiij. deſpiſeth not man / but god.

Is not loue and gentleneſſe (that one Chriſten man oweth to another) a frute of the holy gooſt? Is it not a worke of faith then and of the holy gooſt (yee a frute of that pennaunce which proceadeth of them both) one man to forgeue another?

thouſand times? But I ſe well / ye lack helpe. I will tell you where ye ſhall fynde a text of ſcripture for your purpoſe. S.

that he gaue his onely begotten ſonne / that who ſo beleueth in him / ſhulde not periſhe / but haue eternall life / et cet. He that beleueth on him / is not condemned.
                  And where as ye ſaie / that then were condemned by the church / I anſwere. Yf ye meane the church of Chriſt (which I doubte not to be in Englang / aſwell as in other realmes) then blaſpheme ye it / for ſaienge / that it condemneth them / whom Chriſt with his owne mouth pronounceth not to be condemned.

                  Yf ye meane youre owne mother the church of the froward and multitude of wicked doers / then verely (like a good childe) ye haue diſcloyſed and uttered youre mothers ſecretes / and tolde us hir

very nature / which as ſhe is a very ſpirituall ſtrompet and comon harlot / ſo is ſhe a mother of murther / a ſhedder of innocēt bloud / and (by your owne confeſſion) a condemner of them / whom Chriſt darre advowe to be ſaued.
                  What ye meane by the cenſoure of the powers / a man can not well perceaue by youre wordes / ye ſpeake ſo confuſedly. But yf ye meane the ſentence / iudgment / or determinacion of the hyer powers / then ſlaundre ye them (as I ſaide afore) in that ye reporte / how they ſhulde be the condemners of thoſe / whom Chriſt hath not condemned.
                  Yf by the cēſoure of the powers ye meane your owne vſurped auctorite / or the ſtollen and vntruely gotten auctorite of youre mother the wicked church / then we beleue you.

                  Amonge other (ye ſaye) this was one of his errours.

Yf ye were compelled by force to write / reade / or ſaie anie thinge agaynſt right and conſcience / then like as they be to blame that wil feare man more then god in that behalfe / ſo will god certainlie be the viſitoure of ſuch extreme handlinge. I wolde wiſſhe with all my hert (yf I might laufully ſo do) that the kynges mooſt roiall perſone might ſe as farre / The kynges grace knoweth not of all the euell that is done in his realme. as his hie auctorite extendeth / for I feare the comon prouerbe be to true / that there runneth by the myll much water / which the miller knoweth not of. Nether be all then gentle and louing intreaters of the Kynges ſubiectes / that ſpeake to his maieſtie faire wordes in his face / yee the Kynges grace maie haue Iudas in his realme / aſwell as Chriſt had him in his ſmall courte. I am ſory at my hart rote / whan I remembre / how oft the Kynges highneſſe hath proued his cōcluſion true in his time. I can ſaie nomore / but referre all ſecretes to god / who (I am ſure) will do as he was wont / and bring all falſhode to light at the laſt.

/ ſo farre as I can lerne / there is nothinge maketh more agaynſt you / then that ſame his daies worke. For like as he there openly gaue a good enſample of charite and fraternall reconciliacion / An enſample of charite.

Morouer / how doth god accepte oure ſatiſfaction as ſatiſfactory for oure treſpace / whan no man (by youre owne confeſſion) can ſatiſfie for the offence?

For he that eateth and drinketh vnworthely / eateth and drinketh his owne damnacion / becauſe he diſcerneth not the lordes body from other meates. Therfore are many weake and ſick amonge you / and many ſlepe. For yf we iudged oure ſelues / we ſhulde not be iudged. But whyle we be iudged / we are chaſtened of the lord / leſt we ſhuld be damned with this worlde. Wherfore my brethren / whan ye come together to eate / tary one for another / et cet.
                  By the circumſtaunce then of this chapter / it is euident / that theſe wordes of the Apoſtle extende to the right vſe of the holy ſacrament / teachinge us / that afore we come to the lordes boorde / we ought firſt to iudge / to trie / to proue / and to examen oure ſelues / in what caſe we ſtonde towarde god and oure neghboure / conſideringe / that it is no childiſh playe / ner a thing lightly to be regarded / but a moſt waightie and erneſt matter concernynge oure ſaluacion / the glory of god / and edifienge

of the worlde.The holy ſupper of oure lorde. And whan we haue duely and vnfaynedly tryed oure ſelues (by cōparinge oure whole conuerſacion both inward and outward to the iuſt commaundementes of god) and by occaſion therof haue hartely knowleged and confeſſed oure ſynnes / beynge ſory and penitent for them / beleuynge ſtedfaſtly in the promiſes of god / receaued the abſolucion of his worde / entred in to true repentaunce and erneſt amendment of oure liuinge / beinge reconciled and at one with all men / purpoſinge without fayle ſo to contynue till oure lyfes ende / Then to come / and ſuppe with the lorde. This is now the thing that. S. Paul teacheth in this chapter / and proueth here no ſuch article as ye go aboute. Therfore do ye wrong to the texte / in wreſtinge it to this ſenſe / that euery man muſt ſatiſfye for the puniſhment belonginge vnto ſynne. By the which youre doctrine / O wicked opynion. like as ye robbe Chriſt of his worſhippe / deface the merites and frute of his death / and ſet euery man in Chriſtes rowme / Euen ſo doth your ſaide article cōdemne euery man. For like as Chriſt onely ſatiſfied his heauēly father for oure ſinnes / and for the puniſhmēt due to the ſame / Euen ſo / yf we ſhulde not auoide the eternall paine of hel (which is the ſecond death and rewarde of ſin̄e) till we made ſatiſfactiō for it oure ſelues / we ſhulde contynue ſtill in the wrath of god / and ſo be damned for euer.

Doth he not ſaie manifeſtly in another place / Who ſo beleueth on the ſonne of god / Iohn. iij. hath euerlaſtinge life? And what is it els to haue euerlaſting life / but to eſcape the eternall and ſeconde death / euen euerlaſting damnacion and puniſhment due vnto ſynne? Which (as ye confeſſe youre ſelfe) we do auoyde thorow Chriſt. Why do ye then wreſt the ſcripture to your awne purpoſe? But one queſtion will I aſke you / Oſe. xiij. who ſpeaketh the wordes which are written in the Prophet Oſee / ſaienge / From the hand of death will I deliuer them / from death will I redeme them? O death / I will be thy death. O hell / I wilbe thy ſtinge? Finde me now anie creature in heauen or in erth / that maie of himſelfe verefie and pronounce theſe wordes of Chriſtes perſonne / and I ſhall graunt / that he maie make ſatiſfaction for the puniſhment due vnto ſinne / which (as this text declareth) is eternall death and hell.

                  I beſech you brethren (ſaieth the Apoſtle) for the mercy of god / that ye will geue ouer your bodies / The text Roma. xij. to be a liuing / holy / and acceptable ſacrifice to god / which is your reaſonable ſeruinge of god. And faſhion not your ſelues like vnto this worlde / but be chaunged thorow the renewinge of your minde. Theſe are. S.

                  S. Pauls doctrine is / that we muſt mortifie oure bodies / but to what intent? To make any ſuch ſatiſfaction as ye wolde proue? Naie / ſo ſaieth not the texte / but to the intent that we maie ſerue god / as we ſhuld / ſerue him / to forſake vanite / and to be altred frō an euel minde to a good.
                  
                     Euen ſo like wiſe ſaieth the other text (which I muſt Engliſh for you) in the ſixte to the Romaines / The text Rom. vj. Like as ye haue in times paſt geuen ouer youre membres to ſerue ſinne from one wickedneſſe to another / ſo muſt ye now geue ouer youre membres / to ſerue righteouſneſſe / that ye maie be holy.

                  Yf I do not thus ſatiſfie / then I ſhall haue the rewarde and paine belonging to ſinne / et cet.

                  To the intent that ye maye ſpie the better in what caſe ye ſtand by your awne wordes (I praie god ye maie loke to your ſelfe by times as a Chriſten man ſhulde) I will make you an argument or two out of the ſcripture.
                  To deliuer from eternall death / is to ſatiſfie for the paine due vnto ſinne.Maior. Minor. Concluſio.
                  
                  But Chriſt onely deliuereth frō eternall death.
                  Ergo Chriſt onely ſatiſfieth for the payne due vnto ſinne.
                  The maior is manifeſte by. S. Paul (whom ye youre ſelfe alledge) ſaienge / Roma. vj. The rewarde of ſinne is death / euen eternall death / by youre owne confeſſion. The minor is proued by the Prophet and by the Apoſtle.Oſe. xiij. Heb. ij. Of theſe two premiſſes gather you the concluſion.
                  
                     Another argument.
                  
                     Maior.By what one ſo euer we are deliuered from the wrath of god (both paſt and for to come) by the ſame is made ſufficient ſatiſfactiō for the paine due vnto oure ſynne.
                  
                     Minor.But Chriſt onely deliuereth us from the wrath of god both paſt and for to come.
                  
                     Concluſio.Ergo he onely ſatiſfieth for the paine due vnto our ſinne.
                  
                     Rom. ij.The Maior is manifeſt / for the payne due vnto ſinne is the wrath and indignacion of god.
                  The Minor is euident by the Apoſtle / firſt that we are deliuered onely by Chriſt frō the wrath of god paſt / Ephe. ij Rom. v. Col. j. Rom. v.j. Teſſa. j. for he hath made the peace betwene his heauenly father and us / and by him is the father reconciled. Secondly / that we are deliuered by him from the wrath to come / it is cleare / Rom. v. and j. Teſſa. j. By theſe two premiſſes maie you gather the concluſion.
                  
                     Maior.Now to youre wordes.
                  To ſatiſfie for the payne due vnto ſinne / is the onely office of Chriſt.
                  
                     Mnior.But ye take vpon you to ſatiſfie for the payne due vnto ſinne.
                  
                     Concluſio.Ergo ye take vpon you the office of Chriſt.
                  The Maior is proued by the ſcriptures alledged afore in the two firſt argumentes.
                  The minor is gathered of your owne playne wordes.
                  Of theſe two foloweth the concluſion.
                  
                     Then thus.
                  Ye ſaie / that yf ye do not thus ſatiſfie / ye ſhall haue eternall death.Maior. Minor. Concluſio.
                  
                  But ſo ye can not do / for it is the onely office of Chriſt / Ergo ye ſhall haue eternall death.
                  Beholde now / what a daungerous caſe ye be in by your awne wordes. Alas man / that euer ye ſhulde be ſo blind / as to ſit thus in iudgment / and to geue ſentence agaynſt youre owne ſoule / that Chriſt hath ſhed his bloude for / yf ye cōforme your ſelfe to be partaker therof. Who wolde not note me to be fiue mile fro my right witte / yf I ſhulde make ſuch an argument / and ſaie thus / 
                  Yf I be not Chriſt the ſonne of god / I ſhall haue eternall death and damnacion.
                  But ſo it is / that I am not Chriſt.
                  Ergo / et cete.
                  Yf I ſhulde thus beleue / and affirme this Maior / wolde not ye abhorre me? Turne therfore / turne (for gods ſake) in to youre owne conſcience / and rebuke it erneſtly betwene god and you / for ſuffring either your hand to write / or youre mouth to ſpeake anie ſuch inconuenience.

                  And now of this ſatiſfaction finally to conclude / yf there were nede of no ſatiſfaction / after by repentaunce we be come in to the fauoure agayne with god / why then did Chriſt ſaie / Luke. vij. to them that loue much many ſinnes are forgeuē / and to them that loue litle fewer ſinnes are forgeuen?

                  Youre opinion vpon that place of the goſpell / doth utterly deſtroie the parable of the lender and two detters / The place Luc. vij. yee and Simōs anſwere / which oure ſauioure Chriſt aloweth. For Simon ſaieth / that to whom moſt is forgeuen / the ſame loueth moſt. And againe / our ſauioure ſayeth. Vnto whom leſſe is forgeuen / the ſame loueth leſſe / By the which two ſentences euery man maie eaſely perceaue / that the text ſpeaketh of no ſuch ſatiſfactiō as ye ymagin.
                  But I haue ſpied you now at the laſt. O very cruell enemies to gods holy worde / how falſely haue ye peruerted and turned oure ſauiours wordes / to mainteine youre hereſie withall? Can not Chriſtes wordes ſtand in the goſpell for you / as he ſpake them / and as the Euangeliſt wrote thē / but ye muſt teach him how he ſhulde ſaie?Standiſh maketh a new texte. Doth he ſaie in that place / To them that loue much / many ſinnes are forgeuē / and to them that loue litle / fewer ſinnes are forgeuen? Naie verely / theſe are his wordes / Many ſynnes are forgeuen her / for ſhe hath loued much. But vnto whom leſſe is forgeuen / the ſame loueth leſſe. Will ye ſtill then take vpon you to controlle the holy gooſt? Well / beware / that this your iugling come not to light. Beware (I ſaie) that the breth of god blow not downe youre houſe / for a rotten foundacion can

not ſtand long. Take hede by times / and ſaie ye be warned.

                  Oure ſauiour ſpeaketh of ſinnes / and of forgeuing the ſinnes / And yet are ye not aſhamed to affirme / that his ſaieng can not be concerning the faulte but concerning the puniſhment.Standiſh wold make Chriſt a liar. Can not Chriſt ſpeake a thinge / and meane the ſame? Can he not be true in his wordes? O blaphemers of the ſonne of god / Yee and of that bleſſed woman Mary Magdalene / which muſt nedes be yet in hir olde faultes and a ſinner ſtill / yf he meant not as he ſaide / yf his ſaienge were not concerning the fault / whan he ſpake theſe wordes / Many ſinnes are forgeuen her / et cet.

And god which is able to reſtore the blind to their ſight / ſhall lende men eyes to ſe / and vnderſtonding to diſcerne / whether the doctryne and open worde of god which we teach / wold haue men to liue after ther awne luſtes / Or whether your doctrine (which is of mens inuenting) be not rather cauſe of all wickedneſſe / robbing men of their wittes / and makynge them to renne at riote from gods word / from his ordinaunce / from his commaundementes / from his promiſes / and from the moſt vertuous enſamples of gods children.
                  Now as touchinge oure pennaunce / Ye wold make the worlde beleue / that whan we ſpeake therof / we meane ſome moris daunce / ſome ſuch delicate bancketting as is among the vngodly / ſome vnlaufull chambringe / ſome ſuch exceſſe of eatinge and drynkynge / as (god amende it) is comonly vſed in the world. Againe / your doctrine is / that repentaunce ſhulde be without ioye. And oure beleue is / that yf the holy gooſt and the true faith of Chriſt go together / then like as repentaunce proceadeth of faith / Gal. v. ſo is the ioye of Chriſten men a frute of the holy gooſt / as the Apoſtle ſaieth. Thus alſo to be mery and ioyfull / are we taught by the ſcripture Hiere. ix.j. Cor. j.ij. Cor. xj. Rom. v.viij. Math. v. Luce. x. Shall we thē be ſory / becauſe god hath done ſo much for us? For

                  Another ioye haue we alſo / and the ſame is likewiſe a frute of our repentaunce / appoynted in ſcripture / as whan we ioye with them that ioye / Rom. xij.

Yf ye know anie man to affirme / teach or write / that we nede nomore pennaunce / becauſe ſynne is frely forgeuen in baptyme / he ought to haue an open rebuke. Howbeit the ſame is like vnto your owne doctrine where ye ſaie / that yf Chriſt had taken awaie the paine due vnto your ſinne / ye ſhulde not repent / but folow your carnall libertye.
                  
                     Note this well.Now to your ſatiſfaction / ye ſaie here / that it ſpringeth out of the thirde kynde of pennaunce / and afore in the eight leafe of your treatiſe / to proue it ſtrongly / ye bring in.

This ſcripture now maketh clerely agaynſt you / and proueth your opinion to be falſe / for Chriſtes bloude clenſeth us from all ſinne (none excepte) ſo long as we walke in his light / and not in darkneſſe.

                  The place of Ezechiel is manifeſt / Ezech. xviij. that god will nomore thinke vpon their ſynnes / that truly repent and turne from them. The place of Eſaye ſheweth / Eſaie. lv. that god will haue mercy on ſuch penitentes. The place of Hieremy is plaine / that yf people conuerte from their wickedneſſe / Hiere. xviij. Sap. xj. god will nomore plage them therfore. The xj. chapter of wiſdome declareth euidently / that the puniſmentes which happened to the Egipcians / were ſent thorow the indignacion of god / and that the

trouble / nourture / and correction which the Iſraelites had / came of his fatherly mercy. The cxliiij. Pſalme witneſſeth / Pſal. cxliiij. that the lord is gracious and mercifull / long ſuffringe / of great goodneſſe / louing to euery man / et cet / lifteth vp all them that are caſt downe / and is nie to all ſuch as faithfully call vpon him.Math. xviij The xviij of Matthew is euidēt / hat who ſo euer conuerteth from his ſinne / all mightie god will not that he ſhall periſhe. Item that like as all true penitent ſinners haue their det frely forgeuen them / ſo ſhall they be partakers of the ſame forgeueneſſe ſtill / yf they will hartely do vnto other / as they are dealt withall them ſelues. Theſe places of ſcripture (though ye tell not forth the wordes) are of your owne alledging / and yet are ye not aſhamed to write (yee euen of penitentes) that none of their ſinnes ſhalbe vnpuniſhed. Now is it manifeſt in the ſaid chapter of Ezechiel / Ezech. xviij. that like as god will not rewarde their good dedes that forſake him / and turne awaye agayne to their vomite of wickedneſſe / So will he not thincke vpon their ſinnes that truly conuerte therfrom vnto him. Yet call ye them happie that puniſhe them ſelues / and take vpon them to be ſatiſfactours in that behalfe.

                  This maner of iuſtificacion planely appeareth to be falſe / euen by that one place (yf we had no mo) of Cornelius Acto. x. et cet.
               
               
                  Couerdale.
                  The wordes of the text are theſe / The text Acto. x. There was at Ceſarea a man named Cornelius / a captayne of the Italianiſh company / a deuoute man / and one that feared god with all his houſe / and gaue much allmes to the people / and praied god alwaie.
                  The text ſaieth in ordre / firſt / that Cornelius was a deuoute man and feared god with all his houſe / and then ſpeaketh it of his good workes / as allmes / praier / et cet. Wherby it is manifeſt / that he himſelf was firſt accepted of god and iuſtified / for (as. S. Peter ſaieth afterward in the ſame chapter) god hath no reſpecte of perſonnes / but

(in all people) he that feareth him / and worketh righteouſneſſe / is accepted vnto him. And (as the Prophet ſaieth) The ſtraungers / Eſa. lvj. gentiles or Heithen which cleue vnto the lorde / in worſhippinge him and louing his name / are accepted vnto him / as his owne ſeruauntes. Againe / The ſcripture ſaieth / Eccle. ij. Heb. xj. Rom. xiiij. They that feare the lord / geue credence to his worde. And without faith it is not poſſible to pleaſe god / Item / what ſo euer is not of faith / is ſinne. By this is it manifeſt / that thoſe good workes of Cornelius were frutes of his faith and of the feare of god / and he iuſtified afore he dyd them. Ye confeſſed alſo afore / that faſtinge / prayer and allmes dedes / are the frutes of pennaunce / then muſt ye nedes graunt that the tre was afore them.Diuerſite.
                  
                  This text then proueth not / that oure iuſtificacion (deſerued onely by the death of Chriſt) is a falſe iuſtificacion / ner that Cornelius workes deſerued much of allmightie god afore he was iuſtified. For (as I ſhall rehearce afterwarde) ye confeſſe your ſelfe / not onely that we are iuſtified frely / Diuerſite. but alſo that god firſt geueth us grace / without which we can do nothing that is good.

                  As did the worke of Kyng Ezechie. iiij. Re. xx. et cet.
               
               
                  Couerdale.
                  Your purpoſe is by the enſample of Ezechias / to proue / that oure workes deſerue much of allmightie god / afore we be iuſtified. And that worke

of Ezechias which ye alledge / was done long after his iuſtificaciō. For the texte ſaieth / that whan he laie ſore ſicke / the Prophet Eſay came to him / and tolde him the meſſage of god / iiij. Reg. xx. And that he thē made his feruēt praier and wepte. After the which god ſent him word / that he had heard his praier and ſene his teares / et cet. And afore in the ſame boke / it is euident / iiij. Re. xviij that the ſame Kyng Ezechias dyd the thing that was good in the ſight of the lorde / acording as his father Dauid had done / put his truſt in the lorde god of Iſrael / et cet. cleued vnto the lord / went not out of his pathes / but dyd acording to all the preceptes that god had commaunded Moſes / and therfore (ſaieth the texte) was the lorde with him in all that he toke in hand.
                  Wherfore by the circumſtaunce of the text it is manifeſt / that Ezechias was iuſtified afore he laie ſicke / and that his praier was a worthy frute of his repētaunce long after he was iuſtified / and no worke that deſerued anye thing afore his iuſtificacion. Nether dyd his praier ner the work of the Niniuites chaunge the ſentence of god / Heb. vj. Iacob. j. for god is nether chaungeable ner double in his wordes. But like as (afore the Niniuites beleued in him) he firſt ſent his word / and thretened them / Ionas. iij.
that yf they wold not conuerte / their citie ſhulde be deſtroyed after fortye daies / Euen ſo whan Ezechias was fallen in to ſinne / ij. Par. xxxij. god threatened him / that yf he wold not repent / he ſhuld dye. And like as god (whan we receaue his worde erneſtly / 

beleue ſtedfaſtly in him / and bring forth good workes) doth accepte us / Ionas. iij. as he dyd the Niniuites. Euen ſo though we haue fallen from the profeſſiō of our faith / yet yf we now do erneſtly repent and conuerte / he is mercifull and true to forgeue us oure ſinnes / iiij. Reg. xx. and to graunt us oure peticion after the enſample of. Ezechias. At whom like as all kynges and princes maie take inſtructiō of good gouernaunce / Euen ſo in him haue all other ſinners (that haue broken their couenaunt with god) a very notable enſample of true repentaunce.
                  But how rimeth the enſample ether of Ezechias or of the Niniuites / for the probacion of youre purpoſe? Dyd either Ezechias after he was fallen in to ſinne / or the Niniuites (afore they beleued) deſerue any thinge of god? Or doth anie of both theſe enſamples proue / that oure iuſtificacion (deſerued onely by the death of Chriſt) is a falſe iuſtificacion?
                  Afore in the tenth leafe of your treatiſe / ye alledge the enſample of the Niniuites / to proue / that after the ſinne is forgeuen / Diuerſite. we muſt make ſatiſfaction vnto god for the paine due ther vnto. And now bring ye the ſame in / to proue / that our workes maie deſerue much of allmightie god / afore we be iuſtified. Yf this be not a mockyng with gods worde / let them iudge that are lerned therin.

This text as it maketh clerely for. D. Barnes purpoſe againſt youre ſelfe / euen ſo in alledging of it / haue ye miniſhed it / and left out of it thoſe wordes that make mooſt agaynſt you. But the abbot of lies and father of falſhode (euen the deuell) taught you that leſſon / as I told you afore out of the fourth of Mathew / becauſe ye plaie ſuch another parte with a text of. S.

                  As touching the Germaines (to whom ye impute erroure in this behalfe) Their doctrine is / that whan the ſeruaūtes of god haue done all that is commaunded them / Luc. xvij. they muſt knowlege themſelues to be vnprofitable / to haue occaſion continually to crie vnto god and to ſaie / Matth. vj.

                  This is now the doctrine of the Germaynes / and thus taught alſo.The ſcripture and. S. Auſten mainteine the Germaines doctrine. S.

                  Such doctryne now (though it be approued both by the holy ſcripture and by. S Auguſtine)

                  Your argument is this. God that commaunded us to kepe his lawe / ergo it is not vnpoſſible for us ſo to do.The place Math. xix: But whether your cōſequent will be alowed in the checker or no / we ſhall ſe by our Sauiours owne words. Who whan he had ſaid to the yong man (yf thou wilt entre in to life / kepe the commaundementes) and tolde his diſciples how hard it is for the couetous to entre in to heauen / They aſked him and ſaid / Who can thē be ſaued? Then anſwered he them / ſaieng / With men it is vnpoſſible / but with god are all thinges poſſible. Downe then goeth the Pelagians hereſie / and litle thanke are ye like to haue / for holdinge with it.
                  Yf he aſke / Obiection. Why then doth god cōmaunde us to decline from euell and to do good / yf it be not in our power? To the ſame obiectiō doth. S. Auguſtine make a ſufficiēt anſwere in the ſecōde chapter de correptione et gracia / Anſwere. and not onely refelleth it by. S.P. words (ſaiēg / Philip. ij It is god which worketh in you both the wil and the dede) but alſo putteth

us in minde / Rom. viij that yf we be the children of god / we are led by gods ſprete to do good / that whan we haue done anie good thinge / we maie geue thankes to him of whom we are led / et cet. And in another place / De lib. arb. cap. xvj Therfore doth he commaunde certaine thinges that we can not do / becauſe we might knowe what thinge we ought to aſke of him. The ſame doctrine teacheth he alſo in the lxiij ſermō de tempore.Rom. vij. This is confirmed by holy ſcripture / for by the lawe commeth the knowlege of ſinne / So that euen they which are renewed in Chriſt / fynd by the lawe / that whan they wold faine do good / (for therin is their delite) euell is preſent with them.
                  The wordes of oure Sauioure (yf ye loue me / kepe my commaundementes) proue nomore your purpoſe / then your wreſting of them proueth you to be a true ſcolar of his. For after thoſe wordes he himſelf ſaieth thus / I am the waie / the trueth and life.Ioh. xiiij. No man commeth to the father / but by me. Naie (ſaieth your doctrine) we maie come to god by oure ſelues / he commaundeth us nothing vnpoſſible for us to do. Now let me aſke you this queſtion / Yf Chriſt whan he ſaide theſe wordes (Yf ye loue me / kepe / my commaundementes) did meane / that it is not vnpoſſible for us ſo to do / why then immediatly after the ſame wordes / doth he promes us the ſprete of conforte?

                  Yf by the thirtieth chapter of Deuteronomiō ye

will proue / that god hath commaunded us nothing vnpoſſible for us to do / becauſe Moſes ſaieth / This precepte that I commaunde the this daie / is not aboue the ner farre from the / et cete.

                  Yf ye thinke there to proue your purpoſe / becauſe Moſes laieth before the people / life and death / good and euel / bleſſinge and curſinge / and biddeth them choſe life / et ce. Then muſt I deſire you / not onely to remembre the office of the lawe / wherfore it was geuen / and wher to it ſerueth / But alſo to conſidre / that in the begynnyng of the ſame thirtieth chapter / Moſes himſelf ſaieth theſe wordes / Deute. xxx The lorde thy god ſhall circumciſe thine hert / and the hert of thy poſterite / that thou mayeſt loue the lorde thy god with all thy hert / and in all thy ſoule / et cet. Wherby it is euident / that excepte god circūciſe our hertes / we are not able to loue him / ner to kepe his cōmaundementes / So that theſe wordes of Moſes do proue rather impoſſibilite in us.Roma. ij For the circūciſion of the hert (ſaieth the Apoſtle) is the true circumciſion / which is done in the ſprete and not in the lettre / whoſe prayſe is not of men / but of god.
                  All theſe thre chapters now proue / that like as to be ſaued / to kepe gods cōmaundementes / to haue

circūciſed hartes / and to ouercome the world with the luſtes therof / is the onely workyng of god in us / j.

                  Like as ye proue not here with what text of ſcripture. D.

                  Where fynde ye in the fiftenth chapter of the actes / Acto. xv. that we muſt obeye more then holy ſcriptuture byddeth us? Firſt. S. Peter confeſſeth there in that coūſail / that it is a tēpting of god to laie anie yock of the ceremonies of Moſes lawe vpon the neckes of Chriſtes diſciples / or to trouble the weake conſciences of thoſe which lately we returned and conuerted to the faith / And afore in the ſame place he confeſſeth / that god appoynted and ordeyned him to preach the worde of the goſpell / and maketh mencion of none other doctrine. Againe / Acto. xv. Galat. ij. like as by the comē conſente of the Apoſtles in the ſame coūſail ye ſe / that they wolde not be

brought in to ſubiection / Acto. xv. Gala. ij. ner geue place to thoſe falſe brethern that wolde haue brought in ceremonies of the law / to binde mens cōſciences withal / So wolde they not that the brethren which were turned to Chriſt / ſhulde abuſe their libertie in him / but abſteyne from certayne meates for offendinge of the weake / Roma. xiiij j. Cor. viij. which thinge alſo. S. Paul requyreth erneſtly in his Epiſtles.
                  In the xvj chapter of the Actes Paul and Silas preach the worde of the lorde / and whan Paul ſawe that to circumciſe Timothye was a thing which might be done for the time / and was not requyred of the Iewes as a thing neceſſary / he was content / Wherby it is manifeſt / that like as in thinges indifferent they had allwaye reſpecte to the tyme in forbearinge weake conſcientes for a whyle / ſo preached they none other doctryne but gods onely worde.
                  In the ſecond chapter of the ſecond Epiſtle to the Theſſalonians. S. Paul (whan he hath told them of the great departing from the faith) doth geue thankes to god for calling thē to his trueth of the goſpel / in the which he requireth thē to ſtand ſtedfaſt / and to kepe ſuch ordinaunces as he and the other Apoſtles had taught thē either by mouth or by epiſtle.
                  
                     Acto. xv.Now let me demaunde of you this queſtion / In the xv. of the Actes whan Peter preacheth the worde of the goſpell / and forbyddeth the binding of weake conſciences with ſuperſticious thinges / 

and conſenteth (with the other Apoſtles) to haue ſuch a charitable reſpecte to the tyme / Is that as much as to will / that men ſhal obeie more then is grounded in ſcripture?

                      whan Paul and Silas preach the worde of the lorde / and deale gently with the conſciences of the weake acordinge to the tyme / will they that men ſhall obeie more then holy ſcripture teacheth them?
                  ij. Teſſa. ij. Whan. S. Paul requyreth them to ſtande ſtedfaſt in the trueth of the goſpell / ij.

                  Thus is it euydent where about ye go / namely / euen by your falſe alledginge of ſuch places of gods worde / to deſtroye the worde of god. This is verely (as ye ſaie your ſelfe) the propertye of an heretike / and this propertye lerne ye of the father of all hereſye / euen father Satan / Who by (angelis ſuis mandauit / et cete.) wolde proue / Matth. iiij

                  But like as Satan / wreſtyng that place of ſcripture which made mooſt againſt him / was cō
                     maunded by oure Sauioure to auoyde / so be ye ſure / that your falſe doctryne can not ſtand. Dawlbe your wall and ſpare not / Ezech. xiij for Ezechiel telleth you planely / that god wyll ſende ſuch a ſhower of rayne among all lyeng / prophetes / as ſhall ouerthrowe

                  S.

For he had not onely fayned a new goſpell of his owne / and named himſelfe Chriſtes Apoſtle / but alſo mainteined the hereſie (which the Anabaptiſtes lately helde) that the ſonne of god toke not the nature of man of the bleſſed virgin / and denied rulers to beare office / denied mariage / denied certayne kyndes of meates to be of god / or to be graunted vnto Chriſten men / Taught alſo that ſome mens ſoules dye with the bodyes / deſpyſed the exterior worde of god and myniſtracion therof

/ and ſought other viſions without it / And many other fond and wicked opynions had he / vnknowne to the holy church and flock of Chriſt.Contra Epiſtolam Manichei / quam vocant fundamenti.
                  
                  Now for the refelling of ſuch peſtilent doctryne. S. Auguſtine (among other thinges) wrote one ſpeciall boke agaynſt a certayne Epiſtle of the Manichees / which was called Epiſtola fundamenti / and whan he had ſhewed the occaſions which moued him to abyde ſtill within the vnyte of Chriſtes catholike church / then in the fifth chapter he ſhewed the cauſe / that moued him / rather to geue credence vnto Chriſtes goſpell / then to Manicheus / where among other he ſaieth theſe wordes / Noſtis. n. me ſtatuiſſe / nihil avobis prolatū temere credere / et cet.S. Auguſtines wordes. For ye knowe (ſaieth he) that I am determined to geue no haiſtie credence to anye thing that ye ſpeake of your awne heades. I demaunde therfore / Who is that Manicheus? Ye anſwere / An Apoſtle of Chriſt. I beleue it not. Now what canſt thou ſaye / or do / thou ſhalt not opteine / for thou dyddeſt promes knowlege of the trueth / and now thou wilt compell me to beleue the thinge that I knowe not.Ego vero Euangelio non crederem / niſi me catholice Eccleſie commoueret auctoritas. Peraduenture thou wilt reade me the goſpell / and therby wilt thou aſſaie to affirme the parſon̄e of Manicheus. Yf I ſhulde fynde anye man then / which as yet beleueth not the goſpel / what ſhuldeſt thou do to him that ſayeth vnto the / I beleue not? As for me / I ſhulde not beleue the goſpell / vnleſſe the auctorite of the catholike church dyd moue (teach or warne)

me. Seing that I was obedient vnto them whan they ſayde / beleue the goſpel / why may I not obeie them whan they ſaye vnto me / beleue not Manicheus? et cet.
                  
                     The doctrine of. S. Auguſtine.By the circumſtaunce now of. S. Auguſtines wordes / it is euident / firſt / that he wolde beleue no ſuch doctrine as men brought vp of their owne heades. Secondly / that he wold beleue no vncertayne doctryne / ner that he knewe not to be true. Thirdly / that the occaſion which moued him to beleue the goſpell / was the whole conſent / and auctorite of the catholike or vniuerſall church. Now like as he reporteth not of them / that they preached anie other doctryne vnto him ſaue the goſpell / ſo ſaieth he not / that he beleued anye other lernyng / ſaue onely it. And in confutinge of Manicheus erroure / he bringeth none other doctryne but the ſcripture / as it is manifeſt in the ſame fifth chapter of his boke.
                  What helpe haue ye now in. S.

It is not for naught that ye ſo haue peruerted his ſayeng / and reade it otherwiſe then it ſtandeth in his boke.

                  Afore (to proue by Cornelius workes that our iuſtificacion deſerued onely by the death of Chriſt / Diuerſite in Standiſh doctryne. is a falſe iuſtificacion) Ye ſaye / that his good workes before he was iuſtified / ſomthing deſerued that he ſhuld be called in to the congregacion of our ſauioure / and ſo through gods mercy his workes dyd deſerue much of allmightie god.

                  A very ſpittle faſhion is it (no doubte) to aſke queſtions of the deed. And I ſuppoſe verely / that (excepte it be a cōiurer / a iugler / or a worker with ſpretes) there is none that vſeth it.
                  Touchinge articles at the ſpittle / I am certaine / D. Barnes dyd not affirme there that faith doth not iuſtifie / or that Chriſtes death was not the ſufficient ſatiſfaction for our ſynnes. Now where as he was enioyned to affirme / that though Chriſt be oure onely mediatour / ſauyour / iuſtifier and onely ſatiſfaction vnto god for the ſinnes of them that beleue in him / Yet yf we looſe this grace thorow ſinne / then muſt we riſe agayne by true pennaunce / et cet. Yf for this article (I ſaye) ye will gather that he ſhulde reuoke / then do ye interprete his wordes contrary to his owne declaracion that he made of them in the ſame ſermon. In ſo much that the ſondaye after at Pauls croſſe (as I vnderſtond). D. Wilſon could laye no greater thing to his charge / then that he had expounded pennaunce after his wont maner by the office of the law and the goſpell.
                  Now like as afore in your wordes ye compare this his confeſſion to the cōfeſſion of the deuel / ſo by this and ſuch other your tawntes / ye wold make the world beleue / that he reuoked al trueth at

the ſpittle felde / and that he had all his life tyme taught an vngodly and carnall libertye / the contrary wherof is euident not onely by this preſent proteſtaciō / but alſo by his wryting and preaching afore / Namely / that to the true beleue and conſent of the hert are neceſſarilie required good Chriſten frutes in euery man and womans conuerſacion acording to the ſame. Wherfore this his confeſſiō ſo long as he mainteined no damnable errour contrary vnto it (which in all your babling boke ye haue not proued / nether ſhalbe able to do) was a ſufficient euidence at his latter ende / that he dyed a true Chriſten man. Nether can ye iuſtly condemne him / j. Iohn. iiij. that maketh no worſe confeſſion on his death bedde. Agayne. S. Iohn ſaieth / Euery ſprete which confeſſeth that Ieſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh / is of god. Wherfore ye are to raſhe in iudgment / to affirme that he was iuſtly condemned for hereſie / ſeinge that he nether helde any doctryne ner manteined by euell conuerſacion / eny thing / out of which ye can truly / deduce / that euer he denied the true faith of god / or any one of the benefites or offices of Ieſus Chriſt.
                  As for the articles that were laied againſt him in Cambrige aboue xij yeares agoo / verely like as in repetinge of thē ye accuſe your church to pretende an outward forgyueneſſe / and yet to kepe hatred ſtil many yeares / So appeare ye to fauour them that accuſed him of the ſaide articles / in ſom wherof he mainteined the prerogatyue of prynces

againſt the tiran̄ie and vſurped power ye wote of whom. I ſaye nomore / but yf ye be at that poynt / and may ſo frely write what ye wil / I cōmitte my part of the playe to god. Who (as I doubte not) wil defend the king in his right / ſo am I ſure / that though ye be now in your ruffe / he is not yet hard aſlepe. Where as ye ſaie / that at. D. Barnes death there were thre ſortes of men / and that the firſt ſorte which (by your reporte) wer mooſt contrary to him / wolde geue him no anſwere at his honeſt requeſt / Ye declare planely that / either they had nothing to ſaie agaynſt him / or els litle charite / ſeing that (acording to. S. P.ij. Cor. xj. wordes which ye alledge) they found not thē ſelues greued to ſe the weake offended / yf it were as you ſaie. Nether proueth it thē to leane ſtedfaſtly vnto the piler of trueth / to loue gods lawe / to haue true quyetneſſe in their conſcience / or to be endewed with feruent charite / that folow not the ſame law of loue in the tyme of nede. How do thoſe places of ſcripture then that ye bring in / alowe their acte? Let all indifferent readers iudge / how the cxviij Pſalme / the third of the firſt to Timothe / or the eight to the Romaynes agreeth with their purpoſe.
                  In deſcribing the ſecōde ſorte of people that were at. D. Barnes death / ye faile alſo. Firſt / in reporting of thē / that they euer be and ſhal be as apte to receaue the euel preaching as the good. Secondly / that they are cōtent in theſe matters to go whither they be led. Thirdly / that they are cōtent to beleue

what they be taught. Fourthly / that they know not whan they be in the right waye / ner whan they be forth of it.Matth. xviij Now ſaieth our ſauyoure (in the ſame text which ye your ſelf do alledge) that they beleue in him. Then like as they harkē to his voice / Iohn. x Roma. viij j. Ioh. iiij j. Teſſa. v Iohn. x and not to the voice of ſtraunges / ſo folow they him / and are led of his holy ſprete / And not onely proue all doctrines (whether they be of god) but alſo kepe that which is good / for they knowe Chriſtes voice / and not the voice of ſtraūgers.
                  Morouer / yf that third ſorte of people / did fauour no worſe opinions / and were no fuller of fleſhly and carnall ſenſualite / then this preſent proteſtacion of. D.

Nor they ſhal not go aboute to depoſe their prince / as my lordes the biſſhoppes were wont / In the cxvj leafe. et cet. But yf the kyng will do it by violence / they muſt ſuffre it / but not obeie to it by agrement. Item / Now is it cleare / that we maie not reſiſt this temporall power (in

no wiſe) by violence / et cet.In the cxviij leafe. but yf anye thing be commaunded us that is againſt the word of god wherby oure faith is hurt / that ſhuld we not do in any wiſe / but rather ſuffre perſecucion and alſo death.
                  Be theſe wordes now as much to ſaye / as yf the Kyng commaunde anie thing by tirannie mē ſhall not ſuffre him? What meane ye / ſo vntruly to reporte of the deed? But no maruail / whan ye ſhame not to belie ſo many textes of gods holy word.
                  Touching mens lawes / it is manifeſt / that ſuch as are not grounded in gods word / do not bind the conſcience of man to deadly ſinne. For yf they be not grounded in gods worde / and agreable to the faith therof / then are they ſynfull and naught. Who is bound now to obeie ſinne? But a man maie ſmel you a farre of / whoſe ſucceſſours ye be. You will not ſticke to call it a laufull acte for a prince / to condemne gods word / and to forbid that thinge which is inſtitute and ordeyned of god / Yee yf oure prince wold take ſuch a thing in hand (which god forbid) he ſhuld lacke no inſtigacion of your malignaunt church. Nether can I yet coniecture the contrary / but that ye are aboute ſuch a tragedy. Now go to / ſet your watch men to kepe the ſepulchre / ſuffre not Chriſt to ryſe vp in any wyſe / let not the ſouldiers lack money (the church is riche ynough) caſt your greate heades together / and let Caiphas geue you his moſt ſo tel

counſaill / For whan ye haue done your beſt / and lyed all that euer ye can / yet ſhall god make your policye to ſerue for the glorye of his trueth / Amen.

                     YEe and I ſaye further / yf the kyng ſhuld commaunde you any thing agaynſt gods law / yf it be in your power to reſiſt him / yet maye you not do it.

                  This man nether wrote ner ſayd / that we muſt obeye an erthly prynce / more then allmightie god / and yet are ye not aſhamed ſo to reporte of him. He ſaieth / that though the Kyng commaunde us anye thing agaynſt gods lawe / yet maye we not reſiſt him / Which ſaieng ye call an abhominable hereſie. Thus declare ye your ſelfe manifeſtly / to be of the nombre of them that teach / how that it is lauful for a man to reſiſt his prince. Which thing whether it be not both hereſie and treaſon / let them iudge that haue auctorite.
                  
                     Amos. vijBecauſe Amos the Prophet preached agaynſt ydolatry at Bethel / that falſe preſt Amaſias (whom ye ſpeake of) told that Kyng / that he was

a ſedicious felow / and ſo found the meanes to get him out of the court. Yet played Amaſias a more honeſt parte with Amos / then you do / for he laied rebellion to his charge that was alyue / and your accuſacion is agaynſt the deed. Agayne / Amaſias (being yet a falſe preſt) ſaieth not / that it is laufull for a man to reſiſt his prynce / and you call it abhominable hereſie to teach the contrary.
                  Though Peter and Iohn do teach / that we muſt obeye and harken vnto god more then vnto men / do they therfore teach / that we muſt reſiſt our prynce? Where fynd ye that example in them Peter ſmote of Malcus eare in dede / but litle thanke had he for his laboure. Doth he not teach us to endure grefe / to ſuffre wrong / and to take it paciently? Saieth he not / j. Pet. ij. that we are called ther vnto? Setteth he not Chriſt vnto us for an example of ſuffryng?
                  Becauſe our Sauioure wylleth us not to feare them that kyll the body / Matth. x muſt we therfore reſiſt them? Whan a prynce doth perſecute us for gods wordes ſake in one citie / muſt we reſiſt him / and not rather flye in to another?Matth. v Doth he call them bleſſed that reſiſt / and not them rather that ſuffre for perſecucion ſake?Luc. xxiiij. Dyd Chriſt entre in to his Kyngdome by reſiſting / or by ſuffryng?
                  As for that ſaieng (qui timet hominem / et cet. I can not find it in the xix of the prouerbes / but I fynd ther written / Prouer. xix that a falſe witneſſe ſhall not

remayne vnpuniſhed / and that he which ſpeaketh lies / ſhall not eſcape.
                  Ye call it an abhominable hereſie to teach / that we ought not to reſiſt our prince / though he commaunde us any vnlaufull thing. And to proue your purpoſe / ye poynt us to the fifth of Eſaye / where ther is no ſuch words as ye ſpeake of. But theſe wordes fynd I there / Eſaye. v Wo vnto them that call good euell / et cet.
                  As for the enſample of the ſeuen brethren and their mother / it utterly condemneth you / for they ſaie theſe wordes / They ſaye not / we are ready to reſiſt. We are ready rather to ſuffre / then to offende the lawes of god / et cete. And as they ſaid / ſo they dyd / without makyng reſiſtaunce / though the Kynges commaundement was vnlaufull. What other thing now dyd. D. Barnes teach in his fore rehearced wordes / but (as he had ſaid in his boke afore) that yf the Kyng wolde cōmaunde us anie vnlaufull thing / we muſt ſuffre him / though we obeie not to it by agremēt? What daunger you be in then for teaching the contrary / I will not define. I praie god (acording to his good pleaſure) haue mercy vpon you.
               
               
                  Barnes.
                  
                     THen ſpake he to the ſhereffe and ſayde / M. ſhereffe / I requyre you of gods behalfe / to haue

me commended vnto the kynges grace / and to ſhew him / that I require of his grace theſe requeſtes / firſt / that wher his grace hath now receaued in to his handes all the goodes and ſubſtaunce of the abbayes. Then the ſhereffe deſyred him to ſtoppe there. He anſwered / M. ſhereffe I warraunt you / that I wil ſpeake no harme / for I know it is well done / that all ſuch ſuperſticion be taken cleane awaye / and the kynges grace hath well done in takyng it awaye. But ſeyng his grace is made a hole kyng / and obeyed in his realme as a kyng (which nether his father ner graundfather ner his anceſtours that raigned before him / euer had) and that thorow the preaching of us and ſuch other wretches as we are / which allwayes haue applied our hole ſtudies

/ and gaue our ſelues for the ſetting forth of the ſame / and this is now our reward. Well / it maketh no matter. Now he raigneth / I praye god long maye he raigne among you. Wold god it might pleaſe his grace / to beſtow the ſayd goodes or ſome of them to the comforte of his poore ſubiectes / which ſurely haue great nede of them.
                  
                  
                     The ſecond that I deſire his grace / is / that he will ſe that matrymony be had in more reuerence then it is / and that men (for euery light cauſe inuented) caſt not of their wifes / and lyue in aduoutry and fornicacion / and that theſe that be not maried / ſhuld not abhominably lyue in whordome / folowing the filthy luſtes of the fleſh.
                  
                  
                     The third / that the abhominable ſwearers maye be puniſhed and

ſtrately loked vpon. For ſurely the vengeaūce of god will come on thē for their miſcheuous oothes. Thē deſired he. M. Pope which was preſent / to haue him cōmended to. M. Edgar / ād to deſire him for the deare bloud of Ieſu Chriſt / that he wold leaue that abhominable ſwearing that he vſeth. For ſurely excepte he forſake it / he will come to ſome miſcheuous ende. The fourth / that his grace wil ſet furth Chriſtes true religiō. And that ſeyng he hath begon̄e / he go forward / and make an end / for many thinges haue bene done / but yet much more is to do. And that it wold pleaſe his grace to loke on gods word himſelfe. For it hath bene obſcured with many tradicions inuented of our owne braynes. Now (ſayd he) how many peticions haue I ſpoken of?

And the people ſayd: foure. Well / (ſayd he) euen theſe foure be ſufficient / which I deſyre you / that the kynges grace maye be certified of them. And ſaye / that I mooſt humbly deſyre him / to loke erneſtly vpon them.

                     Dani. liijThe prophet Daniel (I truſt) was no arrogaunt wretche / though he deſyred his prince to make ſome prouiſion for the poore / j. Timo. vj Nomore thē was holy. S. Paul / which taught Timothy to change the riche mē of this world with the ſame leſſon. All they alſo that were true meſſaungers of god / laboured to haue aduoutry / fornicacion / whordome / and abhominable ſwearinge expelled from among Chriſten men / as all the whole ſcripture teſtifieth. Nether dyd. D. Barnes in theſe his wordes requyre anye other thing. His wordes are playne ynough / and yet (as your maner is in your treatiſe) ye ymagen an intent and mynde cleane contrary to the ſame. Ye graunt that he ſpake erneſtly for the poore and for the comons / and yet call ye him an arrogaunt wretch / and (for his good will) reporte of him / that he deſired to haue

a great ſtroke in euery matter of waight / et cetera.
                  D. Barnes ſayd not that he and his felowes dyd refourme thoſe thinges that were amyſſe (for he knew that / to be gods office and the Kynges) and yet ſurmyſe ye the ſame vntruly vpon him. But he ſaieth that thorow the preaching of gods word in the myniſtracion of him and ſuch other / the Kynges grace is now more obeyed then / euer he was before. And I praye you / is it not ſo? Or was it not gods holy word / that gat the Kyng his owne agayne? Maye he thank anye papiſticall doctrine therfore? No verely.
                  Concerning. M. Edgar / yf. D. Barnes had not had a right good opynion in him / no doubte he wold not haue ſent him that commendacion with ſuch an honeſt requeſt. But becauſe he toke him (as he might right well / I truſt) for a gentle man that wolde ſuffre a Chriſten exhortacion / as they will that perteyne vnto Chriſt / therfore was he the bolder of him. As for that ſwearing / I thinke verely it cōmeth rather of a cuſtome (which yet might well be left) then of anye ſet purpoſe. Nether was. D. Barnes acte here agaynſt the proceſſe requyred in the xviij of Matthew / though he had not ſpoken with him afore / ſeyng he might not now come at him.

                     ANd that his grace take good hede / that he be not diſceaued with falſe preachers and teachers and euell counſaill. For Chriſt ſaieth / that ſuch falſe Prophetes ſhall come in lammes ſkynnes.

                  Ye ſhuld haue proued theſe wordes to ſmell nothing but hereſie and treaſon (as ye ſaye in your preface) becauſe they haue the ſwete odoure of the goſpell / Math. vij xvj.xxiiij. where our ſauyour byddeth us beware of falſe Prophetes / and of the leuen of phariſes / and telleth us / that many ſuch ſhall aryſe / and diſceaue many (yee euen thorow ſwete preachinges and flatring wordes / ſaieth the Apoſtle) and becauſe the ſcripture byddeth us beware of ſuch marchauntes / Nom. xvj. Mar. xij. Luc. xx. as goyng in long garmentes / et cete. deuoure wedows houſes vnder the pretence of long prayers.
                  This man called not the Kynges mooſt honoble councell euell / and yet (euen like a pyke thank ſtill) ye ſurmyſe it vpon him. Yf a frend of the Kynges ſhuld ſaye vnto him / I beſech your grace

/ take good hede whom ye receaue in to your preuy chambre / Doth he therfore call his chamberlaynes euell? Or doth he therfore preferre his owne witte aboue the diſcrete wiſdome of the Kynges noble counſaill?
                  Holy. S.ij. Pet. j Peter (as long as he was in this body) thought it mete / to put Chriſten men in remembraunce of their dewtie / yee though they were of ripe knowlege them ſelues / and ſtabliſhed in the trueth. And yet you call it obſtinate pryde / treaſon / blyndneſſe / and raſh fooliſhneſſe ſo to do. Such is your iudgment. Yee euen whan the partye doth moſt humbly deſyre his prynce / to whō he ſpeaketh.
               
               
                  Barnes.
                  
                     THen deſyred he all men to forgeue him / and that yf he had ſayd any euell at any tyme vnaduyſed / wherby he had offended any man / or geuen any occaſiō of euell / that they wold forgeue it him / and amend that euell they toke of him.

                  Stedfaſtneſſe in the waye of gods trueth is to be commended. And an euident token is it / that he is of the ſame doctryne / which wittingly teacheth no euell / reconcyleth himſelfe vnto all men / is ſory yf he haue offended anye man (or geuen any euell occaſion) and geueth other men at their death / an enſample of true repentaunce.
               
               
                  Barnes.
                  
                     ANd that they wold beare him witneſſe / that he deteſted and abhorred all euell opynions and doctrines againſt the word of god / and that he dyed in the faith of Ieſu Chriſt and the ſacramentes of the church / by whō he doubted not to ſaued.

                  Then it appeareth / that yf he had not deteſted and abhorred all euell and erroneous opynions / but had loued your ſtraunge doctrines (which are agaynſt gods word) and ſo dyed out of Chriſtes faith / ye wold haue bene a recorde and witneſſe to him / rather then fayle.
               
               
                  
                  Barnes.
                  
                     ANd with this he deſyred them all to praye for him / and then he turned him aboute / and put of his clothes / makyng him ready to the fyre / and moſt paciently toke his death / yeldinge his ſoule into the handes of allmightie god.

                  What ſo euer he was that firſt wrote theſe his wordes / verely I can not tell / nether dyd I euer reade them or heare them / till I ſawe them in your treatiſe.

                  Takyng occaſion by his erroneous wordes / to iudge he dyed an obſtinate heretike.

                  Ye can not denye / but that after the open confeſſion of his faith / and his humble requeſtes vnto the Kynges grace / he than reconcyled himſelfe to all men / and at the laſt whan he had deſyred thē to praye for him / toke his death paciently / and yelded vp his ſoule in to the handes of allmightye god.

                  A wonderfull thing is it / that ye are ſo vnſtable in your wordes. Do ye not take vpon you afore / to iudge / that he dyed an obſtinate heretike? And now ye can not tell whether he be ſaued or condemned / whether he yelded vp his ſoule in to the handes of allmightie god / or no. But can an obſtinate heretike yelde vp his ſoule / whan he is deed all ready? Can an obſtinate heretike be ſaued?

            Arme thy ſelfe therfore with the confortable enſamples of the ſcripture / And as touchinge thoſe ioly Nimrottes that perſecute gods worde / hunting it out of euery corner / whetting ther ſwerdes and bendyng their bowes agaynſt it / Be thou ſure / that the god of oure fathers Abraham / Iſaac and Iacob ſhall do with thē as he euer was wont to do with tirauntes in times paſt. Thou ſeiſt thorow out the ſtories of the holy byble / how that like as he turneth ſome of their hartes from crueltie to mekeneſſe / Euē ſo with death / with fyre / with water / and with ſuch other his plages deſtroyeth he them that will nedes deſpiſe his warninge / Yee breaketh their bowes in peces / and killeth thē with ther own ſwerdes. As for Iamnes and Iambres thoſe wicked ſorcerers and couetous chaplens that teach cōtrary to gods worde / and diſſuade the greate mē of the world frō it / Their owne wreſtinge and belyeng of it muſt nedes cōfound thē / For

though ther be many that reſiſt the truth / yet whan it is uttered and commeth to light / their madneſſe (as. S. Paul ſaieth) ſhall be manifeſt vnto all men. And as Moſes rodd deuoured their roddes in the Kynges preſence / So likewiſe the ſame places of ſcripture that they alledge for their wicked purpoſe / ſhall deſtroye their falſe doctryne in the face of the world. Yee euen as litle honeſtie as the papiſtry hath gotten by wreſting of (Tu es Petrus et cet.) ſo ſmall profit are they like to haue for belyeng of other textes. Nether is it to be feared / but god will do for one parte of his worde aſmuch as for another / whan he ſeith his tyme.
            Concernyng thoſe bely beaſtes / that (for no cō
               maundement ner promes of god / for no example / warnyng ner exhortacion) will be counſayled / but ſtill blaſpheme his holy worde thorow their vngodly conuerſacion / let not that withdrawe the from the waye of righteouſneſſe. Loue not thou Chriſt the worſe / though Iudas be a traytoure. Sett not thou the leſſe by his wholſome doctrine / though dogges turne to their vomite / and though ſwine walow in their ſtinking mire agayne.
            I knowe (gentle reader) that to all true Chriſtē hartes / it is a great tentaciō / to ſe gods holy worde either perſecuted / belyed / or vnthankfully receaued. But firſt remembre thy ſelfe well by the practyſe of all ſtories / whan was it without perſecucion? Whan was there not one tyraunt or other / that exerciſed all his power / ſtrength / witte / and

counſaill againſt it? Whan were the childrē of Iſrael without ſome bloudy Edomites / Egiptians Aſſirians / Babilonians / Philiſtines / or other?
            Secōdly / Whan was not gods worde belied / peruerted or euell ſpoken of by one falſe Prophet or other? Were there not heretikes and flatringe chaplens in all ages / that withdrue men from the trueth / and miſreported the ſtraight waies of the lord? Thirdly / whan were there not ſome multitudes / that pretēding a loue toward Chriſtes word / did but folow him for their own belies ſake? whan was the ſede of Chriſtes word ſowē / but ſome parte of it fell vpō the ſtony ground where it withred / and among the thornes that choked it vp?
            Wherfore ſeynge thou art compaſed aboute with ſo great a nombre of witneſſes / Heb. xij that is to ſaye / with the enſamples of ſo many godly and holy mē / which not onely dyd choſe rather to ſuffre aduerſite with the people of god then to enioye the pleaſures of ſynne for a ſeaſon / but alſo eſchued falſe doctryne and brought forth allwaye good workes in their liuinge / folowe thou the ſame trade / folowe thou them (I ſaye) as thou ſeiſt they folowed Chriſt / and no farther. And as touchinge anye maner of doctryne / beleue no man without gods worde / acording as. S. Hierome counceleth the. In Epiſtolam ad Gal. ca. v. For certaine it is / that like as many tymes thou ſhalt ſpie euen great faultes in the conuerſaciō of gods electe / ſo readeſt thou of very few teachers ſens the

Apoſtles tyme / which haue not erred (and that groſſely) in ſondry thinges.
            Wherfore whom ſo euer thou heareſt teach / preach or wryte / or whoſe bokes ſo euer thou readeſt / trye them by gods worde / whether they be agreable ther to or no. Whan thou knoweſt them (I ſaye) and art certayne and ſure by Chriſtes doctryne / that they are falſe / ſedicious or abhominable / then hold them accurſed / avoyde them utterly / eſchue them in anye wiſe / and geue ouer thy ſelfe to the wholſome hearing and readinge of the ſcripture. But ſo / that thou be ſober and diſcrete in the knowlege and vſe therof / And that in confeſſing the true faith and beleue of Chriſt / thy hart mouth and dede go together / and that thou cōſent to none opinion contrary to the ſame / That god maye haue the prayſe / and thy neghboure be edified in all thy conuerſacion. So doyng / thou ſhalt not onely ſtoppe the mouth of euell ſpeakers / but alſo allure and prouoke other men to be frutefully geuē to faith and good workes / and to helpe (with ſuch their vnfained faith and godly liuinge) that the tabernacle of god maye be ſet vp againe. The grace of our lorde Ieſus Chriſt be with us all. Amen.

               Yf ye haue a bytter Zele / and there be contencions in youre hartes / make no boaſt / nether be lyars agaynſt the trueth.
