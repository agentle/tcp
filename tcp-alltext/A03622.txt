            Vnto the Chryſtiane Reader.
            I Commend here vnto thy cherite and Godly loue Chriſtiane Reader / the ten cōmaundementes of allmightie God / wroten Exod. 20. and Deut. 5. the wiche were yeuen to this vſe / an end / diligently to be lernid / and religiouſlie obſeruid Deu. 4. Mat. 7. My mynde / and commentaris in them I beſeche the to reade withe iudgment / and yeue ſentence withe knolege: as Idout nothing at all of thi cheryte / or godd willing hart towardes me / and all well meaning perſones. But for aſmouche as there can be no contract / peace / aliaunce / or confederacye betwene too perſones or more / except fyrſt the perſones that will cōtract / agre within them ſelfes vpon ſouche thinges as ſhal be contractyd / as thow right well knowyſt: alſo ſeyng theſe ten commaundementes / ar nothing elſe but the Tables or wrytinges that contayne the conditions of the peace betwene God and man Gen. 19. and declarithe at large / how / and to what the perſones namyd in the wrytinges ar bounde unto the other: Gene. 17.22. Iere. 7. I wilbe God / and you ſhalbe my people. God and man ar knyt to gather / and vnyt in one. It is neceſſary to know / how God / and man was made at one / that ſouche conditions could be

agreyed upon and confirmyd withe ſouche ſolempne / an publicke euidences / as theſe tables be / wroten withe the finger of God. The contentes wherof byndithe God to ayede / and ſuccur / kepe / and preſerue / warrant / and defend man from all yle boothe of body and ſolle / and at the laſt to yeue him eternall blyſſe and euerlaſting felicite: Exod. 19. Deut. 4. Matt. 11. Ioan. 3.4.5.6. Man bounde of the other part to obey / ſerue / and kepe Godes commaundemētes / to loue him / honor him / and fere him aboue all thinges. Were there not loue / an Amite betwene God and man fyrſt / thone would not bind him ſelfe to be maſter / nother the other to be ſeruaūt in ſouche a frendlye / and blyſſid ſotiete / and felowſhipp as theſe tables cōtayne. Before therfore they were yeuen / gode commaundyd Moſes to go downe from the mount Synai vnto the people / to know of them / whether they wold confederat / and entre alyaunce withe hym or not: Exod. 19. Moſes did the meſſayge as God bade hym / where vnto the people all to gather conſentyd. So that is was fully agreyd vpon that God ſhuld be there God / and they his ſeruannes / with certayne conditions / contayning thoffice of them boothe: God to make them a peculier people / to prefer them aboue all natiōs of the erthe / to make thē a prynceli pryſthode / and a holy people.
            There offyce to obey / and obſerue his holy will and pleaſure: Deut. 4. Exod. 19.
            
               Here ſe we the aliaunce and confederacye made Betwen God and man / and the wrytinnes yeuen: like wyce how it was made. But wherfore it was made / and for who is merites / yet by theſe textes we ſe not: wy God ſhuld loue man that ſo neglectid his commaundementes / fauoryd and louyd / beliuyd and / truſtyd better the deuyll then God: Geneſ. 3. ſo farre offendyd the deuine maieſtie of God / and degeneratid from grace / and godlynis by cuſtome of ſinne and contempt of God / that he bewalyd / and repentyd that euer he made man: Gene. 6. and decreyd to deſtroy the creature man / that he creatyd / as he did in dede. Not onlye thus deſtroing man / but alſo proteſtid openlye / that better it had ben Iudas neuer to haue bin born / Matt. 26. and in the 25. chapiter of the ſame Goſpell / the diſpleaſure of God is declaryd ſo great / that he apoyntithe man to an other / end then he was creatid for: ſaing / depart ye doers of iniquite from me vnto eternall fyre / preparyd / not for man but for the deuill / and his Angelles. What is now more contrary one to the other / and farther at debate / then God and man / that now we ſe bound in lege to gather / as very frendes. Moſes Deut. 9. ſhewithe / that onlye mercy prouokyd God vnto this aliance / to receaue them into grace / deliuer thē out of Egypt / and to poſſeſſe the plentous lond of Canaan: farther that God found iuſt mater and occation to expulſe thin habitantes of that land / and found

no merites in thiſraelites to yeue it them / for they wer a ſtyffeneckid people / and intractable as Moſes laythe / to there cherge / Deu. 9. How be it God hauyng reſpect only vnto his promiſes made vnto Adame / Abraham / and his poſterite: meſuryd not his mercye according to the merites of man / who was nothing but ſinne / lokyd all waies apō the iuſtice / and deſeruings / innocenſie / and perfectiō of the blyſſid ſede promiſid vnto Adame / Gene. 3. and vnto Abrahā / Gene. 12.15.17. God put the deathe of Chriſt as amenes and arbiter of this peace / Ebre. 9. For the Teſtament auaylythe not except it be confyrmyd by the dethe of him that makithe the Teſtament: the whiche deathe in the iudgmēt of God was acceptyd as a ſatisfaction for ſinne from the beginning of Adames falle / as Paule ſaythe / Chriſtes pryſthed was and is like vnto Meldizedeck / that had nether begin̄ing nor ending: bound nether to time nether to place / as the priſhed of Aron. but as God accomptid in Adams ſinne all man kind beyng in his loynes / worthy deathe: ſo he accomptyd in Chriſt all to be ſauyd from deathe / Apoca. 13. as Adame declarithe by the Name of his wief / callyd here Heua / the mother of the liuing and not of the ded: Gene. 3. All theſe promiſes / and other that apperteynid vnto the ſaluation of Adame and his poſterite / were made in Chriſt and for Chriſt onlye: and appertainid vnto our fathers / and vs / as we appertainid vnto Chriſt▪ he is the dore / the

waie and the liffe: Ioan. 10. he onlie is the mediatour betwene God and man / with out whom noman can com to the fader celeſtiall: Ioan. 1.3.6. Becauſe the promiſes of God appertainid vnto oure fathers / for aſmouche as they like wyce vnto Chryſt: hether vnto and for euer they were preſeruyd from Hell and the paynes dewe vnto Adames ſinne in him / for who is ſake the promiſe was made. The meanes of oure peace and reconſiliation with God / is only in Chriſt / as Eſai ſaithe capit. 53. by who is paſſion we ar made hole. Therfore Chriſt is callyd by Iohan the Baptiſt / The lamme that takythe awaye the ſinne of the wrrold. Ioan. 1. and as the deuyll foūd nothing in Chriſt that he could eondēne / Io. 14. likewyce now / he hathe nothing in vs worthy damnation / be cauſe we be comprehendid / and fully incloſyd in hym / for we be his by faythe. Al theſe that be comprehendid vnder the promes / belong onto Chriſt. And as far extendithe the vertew / and ſtrenghe of Godes promes to ſawe man: as the rigoure and iuſtice of the law for ſinne to damne man. For as by the offence and ſinne of one man / deathe was extendid and made commune vnto all men vnto condemnation / as Paule ſaythe / Rom. 5. ſo by the iuſtice of one / is deriuid lyffe into all men to iuſtificatiō. The wordes of the promes made vnto Adame and Abraham / confirmithe the ſame▪ They ar thoſe. I will put ennymyte and hatred betwene the and the woman / betwen thy ſeade / and the w

ſede / and hereſede ſhall breake thy hede Gene. 3. for as we were in Adame before his falle / and ſhuld if he had not ſynnyd byne of the ſame innocenſe and prefection that he was creatyd in: ſo were we in his loynes whē he ſynnid / and participant of his ſynne. And as we were in hym and partakers of the ile: ſo were we in hym when god made him a promeſe of grace and part takers of the ſame grace: not as the chyldren of Adame / but as the chylder of the promiſe. As the ſynne of Adame withe out pruylege or exception extentyd / and appertaynyd vnto all Adames / and euery of Adames poſterite / ſo dyd this promis of grace generally appertaine as well to euery and ſinguler of Adames poſtetite as to Adame: as it is more playnely expreſſid Gene. 15.17. Where god promiſythe to blyſſe in the ſede of Abraham / all the people of the worold. And Paule makythe no diuerſite in Chriſt / of jew / nor Gentile. Ferther it was neuer for bid / but that all ſortes of people and of euery progeny in the worold to be made part takers of the jewes religion and Ceremonis. farther ſaynt Paule Ro. 5. Doothe by collation of Adame and Chryſt / ſynne and grace: thus interpretat Godes promes. And makith not Chriſt inferiour to Adame / nor grace vnto ſynne. If all then ſhalbe ſauid / what is to be ſaide of thoſe that ſainct Peter ſpekith of 2. Pet. 2. that ſhall periſhe for there falſe doctrine. And 
                  〈◊〉
                wyce Chriſt ſaythe / that the gate is ſtreighte

that ledythe to liue / and feu entre: Matth. 7. Thus the ſcripture anſwerithe: that the promeſe of grace apperteynithe vnto euery ſort of men in the worold / and comprehendithe them all / how be it within certaine limetes / and bondes: the whiche if men neglect / or paſſe ouer / they exclude them ſelfes from the promes in Chriſt. As Chain was nomore excludid till he excludid hymſelfe / then Abel: Saul then Dauid: Iudas then Peter: Eſau / then Iacob: thowgh Mala. 1. Ro. 9. it ſemithe that the ſentence of God was yeuen to ſawe the one / and to damne the other / before thone louid God / or the other hatid God. How be it theſe threteninges of God againſt Eſau if he had not of his wilful malice excludid himſelfe / from the promes of grace / ſhuld nomore haue hindrid his ſaluation / then Godes threteninges againſt Niniue Ion. 1. whyche not withſtonding that God ſaide ſhuld be deſtroiede within xl. daies ſtode agreat tyme after / and dyd penence. Eſau was circumciſyd / and preſentid vnto the churge of God by his father Iſaac in all externall Ceremonyes / as well as Iacob. And that his liefe and conuerſation was not as agreable vnto iuſtice and equite / as Iacobes: the ſentence of God vnto Rebeka Gene. 25. was not in the fault / but his one malice: for there is mencionid nothing at all in that place Gene. 25. that Eſau was diſheretyd of eternall liffe but that he ſhuld be inferioure vnto his brother Iacob

in this worold whiche prophecye was fulfyllid in there poſterites / and not in the perſones them ſelfes. Of this acceptation of the one / and reprobation of the other conſerning the promeſis of the Erthe ſpekithe Malachie the prophete / as the beginnyng of his booke declarith ſpeaking in this wice. I haue louid you ſaythe the lord / and ye ſay: wherin haſt thow louid vs? God anſwerithe. Was not Eſau / Iacobes brother ſaythe the lord? Not withſtonding I louid Iacob and hatid Eſau. Wherin hatid god Eſau? the prophete ſhewithe. I haue made his poſſeſſion that was the mountes (ſeir) deſolate / as a deſert or wyldernys of dragones / Malachie 1. the whiche happenid in the time of Nabuchodonoſor. Wherin he louyd Iacob the text declarithe. God transferryd the right and title that appertaynid vnto Eſau the elder brother to Iacob the yonger. like wice the lōd that was promiſid vnto Abraham and Iſaac / was by legacy and Teſtament / yeuē vnto Iacob and his poſterites / Gene. 25. an 27. Sainct Paule Rom. 9. vſithe this example of Iacob and Eſau for none other purpoſe but to take away from the Iewes / the thyng that they mooſt putt here truſt in. to ſay / the vaine hope they had in the carnall linaige / and naturall diſcent from the familie and houſhol of Abraham. and likewice there falſe confidence they had in te kepyng of the law of Moſes. Pauls hole purpoſe is in that Epiſtole / to bring man vnto a knolege of his ſinne

/ and to ſhew him how it may be remittid: and with many teſtimonis and Examples of the ſcripture / he prouithe man to be ſauid only by mercy / for the Merites of Chriſt. Whiche is apprehendid and receuid by faithe: as he at large ſhewithe cap. 3.4.5. of the ſame Epiſtole.
            In the vnderſtonding of the whiche thre Chapiters aryght / is requyryd a ſinguler and exact diligence: for it ſemythe by thoſe places that paule concludythe / and in maner includythe the dyuyne grace / and promys of God within certayne termes and lymytes / that only Chryſt ſchuld be effycacyous and profetable in thoſe / that apprehend and receaue this aboundant grace by faythe: and to ſouche as hathe not the vſe of faythe / Chriſt / nether godes grace to appertayne. Now ſeing no man by reaſon of this Naturall incredulyte born / and begoten withe vs Rom. 11. Gal. 3. can belyue and put ſouche confydence in God as he requyrythe by his Law / as experience of oure awne wekenis declarithe / thowghe man haue yers and tyme to belyue / the promes of God in chryſt appertaynythe vnto noman. This Sentence is playne Marke the laſte chapiter. He that belyuythe not / ſchalbe dānid. How be it we know by the ſcrypture / that not withe ſtonding this imperfection of faythe / many ſhalbe ſauyd / and likewyce / not with ſtondyng that Godes promes be generall vnto all people of the worold / Mat. 11. Rom. 11. 1. Tim. 2. Gene. 3. yet many

ſhalbe damnyd. Theſe too poyntes therfore muſt be diligentlye diſcuſſyd. fyrſt how this faythe / being vnperfeit / is acceptid of god: thē how we be excludyd from the promes of grace / that extendithe to all men.
            I will not reherſe now the myndes of other / but as briuely and ſimple as I can / declare the mind of the ſcripture in this mater. Sainct Paule callithe this ſeruitude of ſinne / naturali remaining in oure nature corruptid / ſomtymes apethian / then amartian / at an othere time aſthenean. The firſt word ſignifiythe an imperſuaſibilite / diffidence / incredulite / contumatie or inobedience. The ſecond ſignifiythe Errour / ſinne or decete. The Third betokenithe wekenes / imbecillyte / or imperfection. ſo wrytithe Paule. 1. Cor. 15. mannis body to be firſt borne in imperfection / or imbecillite. Alſo that God concludithe allmen vnder infidelite. Ro. 11. In the Epiſtole to the Galathiens capit. 3. He ſaithe that the ſcripture doothe conclude all men vnder ſinne. in thoſe thre places thow mayſt ſe the thre wordes that I reherſid before withe the whiche Paule deſcribithe the infirmites of man. whiche infirmites / Eſai 53. Io. 1 Soothe teſtifie that they ar translatid into Chriſt. Not ſo that we ſhuld be clene deliuerid from them / as thowghe they were ded in oure nature / or oure nature / changid or ſhuld not prouoke us oni more to ile: but that they ſhuld not damne vs / bicauſe Chriſt ſatisfied for thē
               
in his awne bodie. And Paule ſaithe. Rom. 5. that Chriſt died for ſinners whiche were infirme: and callithe thoſe ſynners thennimies of God. how beyt / he callythe not them Theoſtygas in the ſcripture / that is to ſay cōtemnours of God. Euery man is callid in the ſcripture wickid / and thennimie of God / for the priuation and lacke of faithe / an loue / that he owithe vnto God. Et impij uocantur qui nō omnino ſunt pij. that is to ſay / they ar callid wickid that in all thinges honorithe not god / beliuithe not in God / and obſeruithe his commaundementes as they ſhuld do / whiche we cannot do / by reaſon of this naturall infirmite / or hatred of the fleſhe (as Paule Callithe it Ro. 8.) againſt God. In this ſenſe takithe Paule this worde wickid / Rom. 5. when he ſaithe that Chriſt died for the wickid. So muſt we interpretat ſainct Paule and take his wordes / Or els noman ſhuld be damnid. Now we know that Paule him ſelfe / Saint Iohn / and Chriſt / damnythe the contemprours of God / or ſouche as willinglij cotinew in ſinne / and will not repent. Ma. 12. Mar. 3. Luce 12. Paul Rom. 8.1. Corint. 5.2. Co. 6.2. Pe. 1. Thoſe the ſcripture excludithe frome the generall promis of grace. Thou ſeiſt by the places afore reherſid that thowghe we can not belyue in God as vndourttidly as is requirid / by reaſon of this oure naturall ſickenis / and diſeace: yet for Chriſtes ſake / in the iudgment of God / we ar accōptid as faithfull

fydeles for whoys ſake thys naturall dyſeace and ſyckenys ys pardonyd by what name ſo euer Sainct Paule callithe thes naturall infirmite / or Originall ſinne in man / And this imperfection or naturall ſickenis taken of Adame / excludithe not the perſon feom the promis of God in Chriſt / except we tranſgreſſe the limimites / and boundes of this Oryginall ſynne / by oure awne folie / and malice / and ether of a contempt / or hate of Godes worde we fall into ſynne / and tranſforme our ſelfes into the ymaige of the deuill. Then we exclude by this meanes oure ſelfes frome the promiſes and merites of Chriſt / who only receuid oure infirmites / and Originall diſeace: and not the contēpt of him / and his law. farther the promes appertaine to ſouche as repent. Therfore Eſai Capit. 53. ſaid without excepcion / that the infirmites of all men were caſt vpon his Bleſſid ſhulders It is oure office therfore to ſe / we exclude not oureſelfes from te generall grace / promiſyd to all men. It is nat a Chryſtiane mannes part to attribute his ſaluation to his awne frewill / withe the pelagion / and extenuat originall ſinne. Nor to make God thauctor of ile / and oure damnatiō / withe the Maniche. Nor yet to ſay / God hathe wrotē fatall Lawes as the Stoicke and withe neceſſite of deſteny / uiolently pullithe one by the here in to heauen / and thruſtithe thother hedling into hell. But aſſertaine thy ſelfe by the ſcripture / what be the cauſes of

reprobation / and what of Election. The cauſe of reiection / or damnation is ſinne in man / whiche will not hire / nether receaue / the promes of the goſpelle: or elſe after he hathe receauid it / by accuſtomid doing of ile / he fall ether in a contempt of the goſpell / will not ſtudie to liue there after / or elſe hatiht the goſpell becauſe it condemnithe his vngodly liefe. And would therwere nether God / not goſpell to puniſhe him for doing of ile. This ſentence is trew how ſo euer man iudge of predeſtination. God is not the cauſe of ſinne / nor wold not haue mā to ſinne / Pſalm. 5. Non Deus uolens iniquitatem, tu es. That is to ſay. thow art not the God that willyt he ſinne. Oſee. 13. it is ſaid: Thy perdicion o Iſrael is of thy ſelfe: and thy ſuccur only of me. The cauſe of oure electiō is the mercy of God in Chriſt / Ro. 9. How be it / he that wilbe part taker of this election / muſt receaue the promes in Chriſt by faithe: for therfore we be electid: becauſe afterward we ar made the membres of Chriſt: Ephe. 1. Rom. 8. Therfore as in the iuſtification / or remiſſion of ſinne / there is a cauſe / towghe no dignite at all / in the receauer of his iuſtification: euen ſo we iudge him by the ſcripture / to be iuſtified / and hathe remiſſion of his ſinne / becauſe he receauid the grace promiſid in Chriſt. So we iudge of election / by the euent / or ſucceſſe / that happenithe in the liffe of man: thoſe onli to be electid / that by faithe / apprehend / the mercy promiſid in Chriſt. other

wice we ſhuld not iudge of election. for Paule ſaythe plainlye Ro. 8. that they that be led by the ſprit of God / ar the children of God / and that the ſprit of God dothe teſtifye withe oure ſprites / that we ar the children of God. being admoniſhyd by the ſcripture / we muſt leaue ſinne / and do the workes commaundid of God / or els it is a carnall opinion / that we haue blindid oureſelfes withe all of fatall deſteny ād will not ſaw vs. and in caſe there folowe not oure knolege of Chriſt / amendement of liffe: it is not liuelie faythe that we haue / but rather a vayne knolege and mere preſumpſion. Io. 6. ſaithe Noman commithe vnto me except my father draw him? many men vnderſtond theſe wordes in a wrong ſence / as thowghe God requirid in a reſonable man / nomore then in a ded poſt. and markithe not the wordes that folow. Omnis qui audit a patre & diſcit, uenit ad me. That is to ſay. euery man that hirithe / and lernithe of my father / cumnithe to me. God drawithe withe his word and the holy goſt: but mā
               nis dewty is to hire and lerne. that is to ſay / receaue the grace offred / cōſent vnto the promes / and not repugne the God / that callith. God dothe promeſſe the holy gooſt / vnto them that aſke him / and not to them that contemne him. We haue the ſcripture daily in oure handes / reade it / and hire it preachid / Godes mercy euer cō
               tineu the ſame. let vs thinke verely that now God callithe / and conuerte our liefes to it. let

vs obey it / and beware / we ſuffre not oure folyſhe iudgmentes to wander after the fleſhe / leſte the deuill wrappe vs in darkenis / and teache vs to ſeke the election of God / out of the ſcripture. all thowghe we be of oure ſealfes bound men vnto ſinne / and can do no godd / by reaſon oure originall / and race / is vitious: yet hathe not the deuill inducid holie / his ſimilitude into ony of Adames poſterite / but only into thoſe / that contemne / and of a ſet porpoſe / and deſtenyd malice / hate God. as Pha

We ſhall fynd at lenghe / God to be iuſt in his word / and will puniſhe withe eternall fyre our contumacie / and inobedience / whiche fyre / ſhalbe no leſſe hotte / then his word ſpeakythe of. So did he withe Saul. Perſwadyd the miſerable wreche / that God was ſo godd / that thowghe he offendyd he would not puniſhe hym as he ſaide / but be pleacyd with a fat ſacrifice agayne: 1. Reg. 15. This doctryne is therfore neceſſary to be knowin of all men: that God is iuſt and trew / and requirithe of vs fere / and obedience: as Sainct Iohan ſaythe he that ſend me is trew. Dauid Pſalm. 145. ſpekith thus of his iuſtice. The lord is iuſt in all his waies. And vnderſtand / that his iuſtice extendithe to too diuerſe endes. Thone is / that he wold all men to be ſauyd / Gene. 3.15.17. Matth. 11. Iſai. 53.1. Timo. 2. Ro. 11. The other end / to geue euery man according to his actes.
            To optayne the fyrſt end of his iuſtice / as many as benot vtterly wyckyd / and may be holpe: partlye withe thretenynges / partely withe promiſes / he alurythe / and prouokythe them vnto amendement of liffe. The other part of his iuſtice / rewardithe the obedience of the godd / and

puniſhith thin obedience / and contempt of the ile. Theſe too iuſtice the elders call correctiuam. an retributiuam. Ionas the Prophete ſpekythe of the fyrſt cap. 2. And Chriſt Mat. 25. of the ſecond. God would / all men to be ſauyd / and therefore prouokithe / now be fere menes / now be foule / that the ſinner / ſhuld ſatisfie his iuſt / ād rightous pleaſure. not that the promiſes of god pertaine vnto ſouche as will not repent / or his thretenynges to him that doothe repent. but thoſe meanes he vſithe to ſaue his poure creature / 1. Co. 11. this waies vſithe he to Nurtur vs vntil ſouche time as his holy ſprit / worke ſouche a perfectiō ī vs / that we will obey him / thowghe ther were no paine / nor Ioy mencyonatyd of at all. therfore looke not only / vpō the promes of god / but alſo / what diligence and obediēce he requirithe of the / leſt thow exclude thy ſelfe frome the promeſe. There was promiſid ūto all thoſe that departid out of Egypt with Moſes / the land of Canaā: how be it / for diſobediēce of Godes commaundementes / there was but one / or too that entryd. Of the other part / thow ſeiſt that the menaces / and Horrible thretenynges of God / that Niniue the great cite ſhould be deſtroyd withī xl. daies / nothinge appertainid vnto the Niniuites / be cauſe they did penaūce / and returnid to God.

            A Declaration of the then commaundementes.
            
               Caput I. What the lawes is.
               SEing that the leſte part of the ſcripture requirithe ī the writer boothe iudgment / an circūſpection / that the interpretacion of one place / repung not the text of godes worde / in an other place: Howe mouche more diligence / circumſpection / fere / and loue / requirythe the too tableis of the ten commaundementes / in the whiche is conteinid theffect / and hole ſomme of all the ſcripture. And what ſo ouer is ſayde / or wroten by the Prophetes / Chriſt / or the Apoſteles / it is none other thing / but the interpretacion / and expoſitiō / of theſe ten wordes / or ten cōmaundementes. So that it were no nede at all / to require the mind of ony Doctor / or expoſitour to know the will / and pleaſure of God / manifeſtid vnto the worold in his word / would they that hathe leaſure to rede the ſcripture / ſtudie therin themſelfes. Or ſouche as be appointid / to the miniſterie

of the churche / in there ſermones declared / vnto the vnlernyd what / and whiche commaundement / the Euāgeliſt / Prophet / or Hiſtorie that he prechith / declarithe. If this were donne: then were it no nede / to beſtowe ſo manye yers in reding the gloſe / and interpretation of man. For let him writ / or ſay / what he pleaſithe: he that vnderſtondithe the text / ſhalbe allwaies able / to iudge / whether he writ trew or falſe. and ſo ſtablyſhe his faithe / and knolege / vpō the word of God: and not vpon the interpretacion of mā. conforme all his liffe to this rule and canone of the ten commaundemētes / and not vnto the decrees of man / as God commandithe Deut. 4. Theſe ten wordes / hathe ben largely / and at lenghe wroten vpon / by many great / and famous Clerkes. So not withſtonding as they haue yet lefft ſufficient mater vnto there ſucceſſors / where vpon they may exerciſe / bothe there lerning / and eloquence / as in a thyng mooſt inſcrutable. There is no acuite / nor excellencie of witt / no lernyng / no eloquence / that can cōprehend / or compaſſe the doctrine / and miſterie of the lerning / that is conteinid in theſe commaundementes. They teache aboundantlie / and ſufficientlie / in few wordes / how to know God / to folow vertew / and to com to eternall lyfe. Wherfore it behouythe euery man of God / to know as perfetelie theſe commaundementes / as he

knowithe his awne name. That all his workes / wordes / and towghtes maie be gouernid according vnto the mind / and pleaſure of this law. like wice be cauſe we maie / by the knolege here of / vndreſtond other mēnis writinges / and cōmaū
                  dementes / whether they be of God / or of man / profetable / or pernicious: ledīg to liffe eternall / or to deathe euerlaſting. They reache what God requirithe in the hart / and what in externall cōuerſation / boothe to God / and man: what is to be doune in the cōmoune wealthe / and what in euery priuate cauſe. What is the ſuperioures deutie / and what the inferioures: What the houſboūdes deutie / and what the wiefes: what the fathers / ād what the ſonnes: what to be doune to a citicene / or landes man / and what to a ſtranger: what in the time of peace / and what in the tyme of warr. So that in theſe ten preceptes / euery man may ſe what his office is to do: without farther trauell or ſtudie / 
                     •
                  n ony other ſort of othere lerning. I purpoſe therfore by Godes grace / as well as I can / to open by other places of the ſcripture / the trew ſenſe / and meanyng of theſe ten cmmmaundementes / ſimple / and plainely / that the vnlernyd / may take profe te by the ſame. This order I will obſerue.
               Fyrſt ſhew what this word law / or cōmaundement meanythe.
               Then how the law ſhuld be vſyd.
               
                  Thyrdely / prepare the Readers mynd / that he may allwayes rede / and hyre / theſe commaundementes withe frute / and commodite.
               Forthelye interpretat euery cōmaundement ſeuerally / that the Reader may perceaue / what god the yeuer of the law requirithe of euery mā / that profeſſithe his name.
               Iuſtinian. lib. 1. pandect. tit. 1. ſaithe that the law is a facultie / or ſciēs of the thing tat is god and right / as celſus there definithe. Or thus the law is a certaine rule / or canon / to do well by / whiche awght to be knowē / and kept of all men. Cice. de leg. ſaithe / that the law / is a certaine rule / proceding from the mynde of God / perſwadyng right / and forbydding wrong.
               So that the law / is a certaine rule / a directorie ſhewing what is godd / ād what is ile: what is vertew / and what is vyce / what profetable / and what diſprofetable: what to be doune / and what to be lefft vndoune. This declaration of the law generall / apperteinithe vnto all the kindes / mēbres / and particuler lowes / made other for the body / ether for the ſoule. So that who ſo euer be ignorant of the law / and rules that apertaine vnto the ſciens / or art / that he profeſſithe can neuer com to thend / or perfection / that his profeſſion requirithe. As for example. thend of a Chriſtiane man is eternall liefe / and his profeſſion is / to know / and lerne the law and

canones / that mooſt plainely / and ſincerlie / ledithe him vnto this end / of eternall felicite. As the lawe of God / whiche is a certaine doctrine / ſhewing what we ſhuld be / what we ſhuld do / and what leaue vndonne. requiring perfet obedience towardes God / and aduertiſing vs / that God is angre / and diſpleafid withe ſinne / and will puniſhe eternally / ſouche as performe not all thinges perfetlie / cōteinid in this lawe. as ye may rede Mat. 22. Exod. 20. Deu. 6. Thoſe places / ſhew that God requirithe of vs / perfect obedience. What payne is dewe / to the ſtranſgreſſour / ye may rede / Deut. 28. Curſid be he that fulfillith not the law. and like wiſſe / Mat. 24. Depart from me ye workers of iniquite / into eternall fier. I declare now / good reader / what the law is / and not how it may be fulfillid. that I defer vnto thend of thexpoſition / of the law. Howbe it I would thow ſhuldes moſt diligentlie marke this diffiniciō / or declaratiō / what godes law is that thou maiſt kno / what differēs is betwen the law of God / and the law of man. Mannes lawes / only requirithe externall / and ciuile obedience. Godes lawes boothe externall / and internall.
               Now he that is ignoraunt / of themeanis / is ignorant of thend. Benig ignorarunt of the cauſes / muſt nedes be ignoraunt of theffect. Onlie by the law of God / the meanes is knowen

/ therfore onlye the law of God if we will com to thend that God would vs to do: is diligentlie to be lernyd. For like as the phiſicion / cannot communicat his healthe withe the ſick patient: or the lyuing man his lieſe / withe the ded body of an other (but euery man enyoythe his awne healthe / and lyuithe withe his awne liefe) ſo profetithe not / him that is vnlernyd / the knolege of an other man. but euery man muſt know / and lern himſelfe / the law of God / if he wilbe ſauyd / Io. 6. Deut. 4. As he that wilbe a phiſiciō / muſt lern the preceptes / that teachith phiſick. A muſitiō / the rules of muſick / the oratour / the rules of Rethorick. The plowgh mā / the rules of huſboundre: and ſo euery perſon the rules that belong vnto his profeſſion / or elſe he ſhall neuer profet in his ſciens / or art: nor be accomptid a crauſtes man / that knowith not the principles / of his crauffte. Nomore / before the maieſtie of god / is he accō
                  ptid a chriſtiane mā / that perfetlie knowith not the commaundementes of God / thowghe he be chriſtenid / and braggithe of the Name / neuer ſo mouche. And becauſe that no man ſhuld excuſe his ignoraunce / and ſaythe Bible is to lōg / and conteynithe ſo highe miſteris / and ſecreates / that the laboring man / hathe nether ſufficient tine / nether conuenient vndreſtonding / to lern the law / and commaundementes of God:

it pleacid his infinite goddenis / to collect / and gather the contentes / and ſomne of the whole law / into ſo ſhort / and cōpendious abridgmēt that no ſciens of the worold / hathe his principles or generall rueles / concludid with ſo few wordes. Experiēce / and proue / declarith the ſame. The logicion / hath no lece / then Ten generall rules / callyd predicamentes / wherin is conteynid thole mater of his art. The Rethoricion / thre maner / and dyuerſe kyndes of cauſes / Demonſtratiue / Iudiciall / and deliberatiue. Thole body of the law Ciuile / theſe thre principles / liue honeſtlie / hurt noman / and yeue euery man his / Iuſtinianus / libr. 1. Inſtitu. The phiſition / as many principles / as be kindes of diſeaces. The heuenlie God eternall / hathe concludyd all the doctrine Celeſtiall / in ten wordes / or cōmaundementes / Exo. 20. Deu. 5. And yet / for a farther healpe of our vnapt memorie / to retaine the will of god: he hathe gatherid / the ſaide ten commaundementes / into too / Mat. 22. Mar. 12. Loue God with all thy hart: and thy neyghbour as thy ſelfe / Deut. 6.26. Leuit. 19. So that euery dull / and hard wittid man / may ſoner lern / the principles / and generall rules of Chriſtes religion / thē of ony other art / or ſciens / if he yeue his diligence / ony thing at all / for the ſpace of one monethe.
               There be many cauſes / that ſhuld prouoke

man vnto the ſtudye / and knolege of this lawe. Firſt / the profet that Cummith therof / whiche is expreſſid / Ioan. 17. This is liffe eternall ſaith Chriſt / to know the / O father: and him that thow haſt ſent / Ieſus chriſt. Dauid the prophet / deſirid the knolege of this lawe / and ſo copiouſlie / expreſſithe the commodite ther
                     •
                  f / in the mooſt holie Pſalme 118. that nothing of this worold may be comparid to it / for it ledithe to eternall lieffe. What commodites / it bringithe in this worold / it is declarid Deut. 28. et Pſal. 128. if thow hirethe wice of thy lord God / and obſerue it / thow ſhalt be bliſſid in the fild / and at home / bleſſid in all thynges that thow takeſt in hand / to do. rede the Chapiter. if thow wilt not lerne / the will of thy lord: thow ſhalt be curſid in the feld / and at home: and vnfortunate in all thy actes. farther / without the knolege and obedience of this law / no perſon in the worold can iuſtlie / and conuenientlie ſerue in his vocation / or condition of liefe / of what degre ſo euer he be. Wherfore Moſes commaundid / Deut. 4. that noman ſhuld decline / from this lawe / nether to the right hand / nether to the leiffte: mening by theſe wordes / that noman ſhuld add / or take ony thyng from it / but ſimple / to be obſerue it / as it is yeuen / and wroten vnto vs / Ffrom this rigth line / and trewe regle of Godes word: man arrith diuerſe waies. ſom

time by ignorance / becauſe he knowithe not / or will not know / that onlie thexpreſſe word of God ſufficithe. He holdithe withe the mooſt part and cōdemnithe the beter / as it is to be ſene / at this preſent daye. This reaſon takithe place: it is alowid of the mooſt part / and ſtabliſhid by ſo many holie / and lernid biſhopes / therefore it is trew. When / they can not by the ſcripture proue / neither the lerning / nether the lief of there doctors / to be good.
               The ſecond waie / that ledith from the word of God / is mony times / the poure / and authorite of this worold. As we ſe / by the biſhope of Rome. and all his adherentes / who yeuith more credenc / and faithe onto one Charter and gift of Conſtantinus / then to all the hole bible. An other errithe / by miſtakyng of the tyme / making his ſuperſticiō / far elder then it is / will not for ſake the faulſhed for the truithe. An ſaithe / thus my father beliuide / and ſhuld I beliue the contrarie? thus rather / will giue credit to his father being blind / then vnto God his great graunt father / that ſeith. to the law of man more credit / then to the law of God. As the knolege of man is thus with drawē / frō the word of God / be ignorancie / and ile vſid cuſtomes / ſo is the liue / and conuerſation of man like wice. Not gouernid withe the word of god / but with accuſtomid fraude / an gile: euery man in

his uocation / and condition of lyffe. The ſpiritualite with falſe receauid / and ile deſeruid / tea this. The temperaltie / with falſe cōtractes / and prepoſterous bying / and ſellnig. The princes / and ſuperiour poures of therthe / for the mooſt part / and all lernid men / other in mayntaining a wrong religion / or in not reſtoring the trew / decline / far from this ſimple / and ſincere verite conteinyd in godes word. Some diſpenſe with a leſſe yle / to a voyede a greater harme. Some preſcribe lawes / for the conſciens of man / for atime / vntill it may be / farther deliberatid vpō / or approuid godd / by a generall counſell. Theſe men / greuouſlie offend thē ſelfes / and cauſith other / to do the ſame. In caſe the law: made for the time / ſeme not godd / vnto ſouche / as ſhall at amore leaſure / haue thexamination therof: the lawe for the meane time / ſhalbe condemnid / as hereticall / and pernitious.
               Then put the caſe / that many / or at the leſte / ſome of thoſe that ledd there conſciens / after the lawe / made for the meane tyme / dye. How ſtondithe then the caſe / withe theſe departyd ſoules / that were deceuyd / whiles they liuyd / by falſe doctrine. Thei doutles / ar looſt / for euer / and without tyme / if they dyed / in ony errour of the Catholice faith / as Criſt ſaythe Luce 6. ſpekyng of falſe interpretoures / of the word of God. If the blynd / lede the blind / he ſayth / 

not / only he that ledith ſhall fall into the dyche: but boothe. Therfore it is not ſufficient / that people haue a lawe for the meane tyme: but what ſo euer / the conſciens begynnithe with all / it muſt end / in the ſame. That is to ſay: no law at all ſhuld be ſpoken of conſernyng the conſciens / but thonlie word of God / whiche neuer alteryd / nor cannot be alteryd / Matt. 5. Luce 16. Pſal. 18. Dauyd Pſalmo 119. prouithe the immutabilite of Godes worde / by too ſtronge reaſones. if heuens / and Erthe made by thy worde can not be alteryd / how mouche more the word it ſelfe? Rede the too verſes that begynne withe the letter lamed. in Engliſſe thus. Thy word lord abidithe for euer / as the heauens teſtifye. Vnto the whithe law / the conſciēs of man / in maters of faithe / is bound onlie. for when ſo euer / or who ſo euer preſcribythe ony law / for the cauſe of religion / and yeuith it this title / for the meane time / vntill it may be iudgyd by a generall counſell / or other wyce decreyde / by thaſſemblaunce of lernyd men: thauctor of the law / declarithe hime ſelfe / not to know / whether his law be trew / or falſe / leding to hell / or to heuē / to ſaue the cōſciēce of man or to dāne it: but leuith it in dowt / ād makith it as vncertaine / as theſe that ſhall haue the cēſure / ād iudgmēt therof / preferrid ūto there diſcretiō ād lerning. I would wiſhe therfore / ād hartel

pray vnto almightye God / to put into the hartes of all ſuperior poures of the Erthe / grace / and knolege / to choſe 4. indifferent iudges / to apeace all contrauerſes in religion. If the Clergie ſhuld iudge / the worold would / and might ſay / they ar to partiall. and for many reſpectes / would to mouche fauour / there awne cōmodite. If the Temperalty ſhuld iugde / the Clerge would think / ſom̄ thing to be downe of diſpleaſure / or malice / that allwaies in maner / hathe remainid betwene the partes. Farther if Apapiſt / Lutherion / or Zuinglion ſhuld iudge: they agre / ſo ile / one with tother / that the mater could not want ſuſpicion. Therfore I would haue / ons theſe iiij. indifferent iudges to breake the ſtriffe. The Bible in Ebreu / the Bible in Greke / the Bible in Latine / and the Bible in Engliſſe / or in ony other oulger tong / according to the ſpeache of the Realme / where this communicatiō ſhuld be had. Then doutles / theſe iudges that fauorith not / moreth one part / then the other: no more one perſon / then the other: Would ſone ſet men at peace: incaſe they louyd not diſſention. But as long / as thauctorite of ony generall counſell / or iudgment of mā / is accomptyd equiualent / and egall withe the word of God: the truythe / cannot be ſincerelie knowen. Souche as can interpretat / nothing well / but lokithe to fynd occation / to calumniat

the good meanyng of the thing well ſpoken / wil ſay I haue an ile opinion of God the eternall in heauen / and like wyce of the ſuperiour poures in hearthe / bycauſe I damne the diſciples of the falſe Doctors / withe the doctors: and take from all poures of the erthe auctorite to preſcribe ūto there ſubiectes / ony law / touchyng religion / of the ſolle. As conſernyng the iudgment of God / agaynſt thoſe that be ſeducyd by falſe prechers / or makers of falſe lawes / Sainct Luce capit. 6. Ezech. 3. et 13. iudgithe as I do. And as touching the queſtion. What I ſhuld then ſay of oure fore fathers / that euer ſithe the tyme of Cō
                  ſtantine temperour and Sylueſter the Biſhope of Rome hathe allwaies in maner / byn ſeducid by the falſe docrine of man: I can iudge / none other then / the ſcripture teachithe. Boothe he that ledithe vnto damnatiō
                   / and he that is led / fallithe into the pytt. And in the ſame place / Chriſt ſaythe / that it ſufficithe the diſciple / to be as his maſter is. Sainct Paule deſcribithe the nature of ſouche as preache falſe doctryne thus 2. Tim. 2. they lede vnto iniquite: and there communication / eatithe as the diſeace of a cankre. Meanyng that fal ſe doctryne / hurtithe not on lye him / that is ſeducyd: but like wyce / ſouche as ſhalbe his hereres. And as this diſeace callyd a canker / if it be in ony part of mannes body / it infectithe allwaies the next partes vnto it as Galenus

writithe de cauſis morborum: like wice Leonhardus Fuchſius, De compendio medicinae. And Ouidius thus. Vt

               Euen ſo the preaching of falſe doctrine / may deceaue euery man but ſpecially the ſimple and on lernid / as it is to be ſene at this daie / the more petie euery where. Eaſier for a ſoule / that can do nothing / but bliſſe a tubbbe of water / to kepe and hundrethe in ſuperſticion / and the adulterous doctrine of man: thē for him that is well lernyd in the law of God / to winne ten vnto Chriſt.

               IT is well knowen by the places afore reherſid / that the law of God requirithe an inwarde / and perfete obedience / vnto the will of God / the whiche this nature of man corruptyd by Originall ſinne cannot performe / as ſainct Paule prouithe manifeſtlye in the 7. an 8. chapiter to the Romaines.

                   as is requirid. Noman can abide to hire his defaultes rebukyd by the law / but hatithe his admonitours / and would that there were nether God / nether law ſo that he might vnpuniſhyd ſatisfye his pleaſure. Like wyce the will as frawarde / and peruerſe that it willith nothing of God / ner of his law / if it demynyſhe ony part of ſouche goddes / or pleaſure / as the worold requirithe / as we may ſe / by dayly defection / and departure from the knolege of Godes worde / in thoſe that ons were as ardent as fyer. But now as the Gadarenes dyd / Matth. 8. Luce 8. Marc. 5. They deſire Chriſt do depart out of there countre / rather then they would looſt there ſwyne. Where is now the will / that frely and Franklye ſhuld for ſake all the goddes of the worold / and alſo this mortall liffe / rather then to leaue Ieſus Chriſt / which as Iohan ſaithe / onlie hathe the word of eternall liue cap. 6. it is not nede to proue this peruerſnys and wyckyd reſiſtence agaynſt God and vertew by thexample of othere: but euery man may fynd himſelfe to mouche infectyd with this diſeace / would he loke vpon his awne liefe / and be as egall a iudge of him ſelfe / as he is temerous in iudging of other.

               Seing the workes of the law cannot deſerue remiſſion of ſynne / nor ſaw man / and yet God requyrythe our diligens / and obedionce vnto the Lawe: it is neceſſary to know the vſe of the law / and why it is yeuen vs.

                  . Timoth. 1. The law is yeuen to the vniuſt. Wherfore God commaundythe the Magiſtrates and ſuperiour poures of the Erthe to puniſhe the tranſgreſſours of the law made for the preſeruation of euery commune wealthe / as we rede / Deut. 19. thow ſhalt remoue the ile / doune in the commune wealthe / that other may fere to do the ſame. Thow ſhalt haue no pytye vpon the tranſgreſſoure. for ſouche petye as is vſyd of man agaynſt this commaundement towardes the tranſgreſſours: is rather amayntenaunce of ile then workes of mercye.
               The ſecond vſe of the law is / to informe and inſtruct man aright what ſynne is / to acuſe vs / to fere vs / and to damne

us and oure iuſtice / becauſe we performe not the law as it is requiryd / Rom. 1. et 7. howbe it the law concludithe all men vnder ſinne / not to damne them but to ſaw them / if they comme to Chriſt / Rom. 11. Gala. 3.
               Theſe too vſes of the law / appartayne as well vnto the infideles / as to the fideles. To ſouche as be not regeneratyd / as to thoſe that be regeneratid: for thoſe that ſhe cānot bring to Chriſt / ſhe damnythe.
               The thyrd vſe of the law is / to ſhew vnto the Chriſtians what workes God requirythe of them: For he would not that we ſhuld fayne workes of our awne braynes to ſerue him withe all: as the Biſhoppes lawes that teachithe an othere faythe / and other workes then the old Teſtament or the new. but requirythe vs to do the workes commaundyd by him / as it is wroten / Matt. 15. they worſhipp me in vayne with the preceptes of men. Therfore Dauid ſaithe: thy worde lorde God is the light vnto my fette / Pſal. 119. By the knolege of this law / we iudge all other mēnes writinges / Chriſtianes / ād Ethnyches / wether they writ well / or yle. And withe out a right knolege in this lawe / no doctrine cā be knowen whether it be trew / or falſe.
               This law iudgithe / who defendid the better part / Marcion / or Tertulliō: Auguſtine / or Arrius / Chriſt and his Apoſtelles / or Caiphas / ād

his colege of ſcribes and phariſes: the poure preachers that withe danger of liefe ſet forthe the glory of God / or the Pope withe his colege of Cardinales: that with wyckid lawes / ſtudy to deface the glory / and maieſty of Chriſtes churche. where and what is the Catholike churche of the chryſtians: and where the Synagoge of Antechriſt. No falſhede can be hydd / if men ſyke the truythe withe this light. If we examyne our deades / or other mennes by this lawe or Canon: we ſhall ſoone perceaue / whether they pleace God / or diſpleace. If we be preaſyd / and haue an honeſt eſtimation among people: bring boothe our conſciens / and preace of the worold / vnto this rule of Godes worde: and then ſhall euery man iudge himſelfe / whether he be inwardely the ſame man: that people eſteme him for vttwardlie. Incaſe man / ſuſtayne like wyce diſpreace / and contempt / of ſouche as be in the worold / if the law of God bare teſtimony with his conſciens / that it is rather the Malyce of the worold / then his demerites / that oppreſſith thus his godd fame withe the burden of ſlaunder: he ſhall rather reyoyce / that God hathe preſeruyd him from the crymes that he is falſely accuſyd of / then impatientlie ſouffre the malicious worold / maly / cyouſlie to iudge good / to be ile / as it is his accuſtonyd maner.
               
                  This law iudgithe that Ariſtotell in his morales teachithe better doctrine when he cōdemnithe thexternalle fact incaſe the mynd and will concur not to the doing therof: then the Biſhoppes in there decreis that attribute the remiſſiō / of ſinne nether to contrition / ner faithe / nether to Chriſt / but vnto thexternall ſprynglyng of a droppe of water. for thus they ſay of the water / and of trebred. in the exorciſme / or coniuration of the water: Fias aqua exorcizata ad effugandam omnem poteſtatem inimici &c. That is to ſay. I coniure the: in the name of God / as it is at the beginning of the coniuration / to be a water bleſſyd / to expell all the poure of the deuyll. Of the breade thus: Benedic domine iſtam creaturam panis, ut omnes guſtantes ex eo, tam corporis, quam animae recipiant ſanitatem. That is to ſay: Blyſſe lorde this breade that as many as taſte therof / may receaue healthe / boothe of body / and ſolle. By this law thow maiſt iudge who defendithe the better opinion. Numa Pomp that for byd ymages: or elſe the Biſhoppes lawes / that ſay Idoles can teache the vnlernyd people / and be / to be vſyd. Bring the mater to iudgment / and ſe whiche opinion Godes law will defend: Non facies, inquit Deus, ſculptile, aut ullam ſimilitudinem. Thow ſhalt make no ymaige &c. Who is law is more conſonant withe Godes lawes / the decrees / and preceptes

               Godes lawes ſaithe with Cato: Honora parentes. Omnis anima poteſtatibus ſupereminen tibus ſubdita ſit, Roman. 13. Exod. 20. that is to ſay / Honor thy father: and euery man be ſubiect vnto the ſuperiour poures. The Romaines Reprehendid and depoſyd like wyce the tyranne / Nero for his crueltye: and kyllyd the vitious Prince Tarquinius Sextus for vitiating of the chaſte Matrone Lucretia. the Biſhopes lawes ſaithe thus.

               The ſecond rule / or preparatyue is: that thow

haue aright opinion / of the magiſtrates / and ſuperiour poures of therthe / that thow yeue thē nomore / nether no leſe honor / nor reuerence / then the word of God commaundithe. This he declarithe by the 12. Princes that were ſent to explorate / and ſarche the priuites and conditiō of the lond of Canaan / too of thē perſwadid the people to beliue Godes promes / and not to fere the people / that dwellyd in the land. vnto theſe Godly Princes / was no faithe / nor credit yeuē of the people. The Princes that perſwadid the thing contrary vnto God / were beliuid of the people / and there counſell admittyd. by this we lern / that ſouche Magiſtrates / as perſwade the people by Godes word / ſhuld be beliuid and obeide / the other not / in the cauſe of conſciens. There / muſt God only be hard Act. 5. Matt. 10. Or elſe people ſhall faile of a right faythe / for he that knowith not / what his deutye is to God / and his lawes: will beliue rather alie with his fore fathers: then the truithe with the word of God. and this mā is no mete auditour nor diſciple of the word of God.
               For lacke of this preparatiue / the worold / hathe erryd from the truithe this many yers / to the diſhonor of God / and danger of Chryſtiane ſolles. Men doothe not loke what godes worde ſaithe / but extollithe the auctorite of mannes lawes / preferring the decre of a generall / 

or prouinciall conſell before the word of God / whiche hathe browghte this abhomination / ād ſubuerſion of all godlye doctrine / in to the churche of Chriſt.
               The thyrd preparatiue / is obedience: boothe vnto God and man. It were as godd / neuer to reade the ſcripture / nor to hyre ſermon / incaſe we mind not to obey vnto the word of God ſpoken / or reden. Therfore doothe Moſes abraide / and reprehend them / Deu. 1. whē they knew the lond to be godd / by the frute that the 12. princes browght vnto them / they would not procede forthe in there iurney to poſſeſſe the land / but murmuryd againſt God / wherfore they peryſhyd in the deſert. Therefore / we muſt brīg with vs vnto the reding of the word of God / obediē
                  ce / and be redy to do euery thing / it commaundethe / thowghe it ſeme neuer ſo difficile / As Abraham did in leuing his countre / Geneſ. 12. and offryng his ſonne / Gen. 22. and as chriſt commaundith all that will be his Diſciples / Matth. 10. Luce. 14. the thing that God commaundithe muſt be obeyd / what danger ſo euer happen. Ye if it be the loſt of oure lieffe / Luce. 9.17. Matth. 16. Like wyce the commaundement of the ſuperiour poures / and noman ſhuld detract / nether denye his obedience beccuſe he is a Chriſtiane / 1. Pet. 2. Ro. 13. Ephe. 6. Col. 3. Tit. 2. not onlie with Iye ſeruice / but from the hart. ſuſtaining

not onlye ſouche chargis as the neceſſites of the cōmune wealthe ſhall require / but alſo withe liefe / to defend the ſame / not ferīg how ſtrong an ennimie is agaynſt hym / nor how manye: but rather to conſider / how ſtrōg / God is that hathe promiſid to preſerue euery mannes right / and yeuen commaundement that nomā ſhall do the other wrong.

               The fourthe preparatiue is / that they ſhuld obſerue / the commune lawes vſyd among all people whiche is callid ius gentium. that they ſhuld peaceable paſſe by the poſſeſſions of the children of Eſau the Mount Seir and like wice by the Moabitis / not to moleſt thē / nether there Godes. but by ſouche thinges as they wantid for monie / till they paſſid there limites / ād bondes the whiche law bound them / not to ſpoyle / robbe / and barne / wher ſo euer they came as well there frendes as there fores / as it is vſyd in oure tyme among Chriſtianes / that ſay ſilent

                     ••
                  e is / that they ſhuld eſteme this doctrine of the commaundementes as it was worthy. And declaryd the eſtimation therof withe mony reaſones. The fyrſt / of the vtilite / ād profete that it bringithe wherof he ſpekythe in the 4. cap. Deut. Haec eſt ſapientia, & intelligentia veſtra coram populo. That is to ſay / this is youre wyſdome / and prudence before the people: this is the doctrine onlie and law that teachithe how to lyue well / ād to auaide the diſpleaſur / boothe of god and man / and ledithe to eternall felicite. what other people is there of the worold / ſaithe Moſes that hathe there godes as preſent / as oure lord God as many times / as we inuocate and call vpon him. This doctrine was yeuē from heauē / and the auctor there of is God. A doctrine allwaies to be lernid and obſeruid: not in Paper / or parſhment / but in the hart of man. And dailie tawghte vnto the worold / as the maner of the yeuyng of it declarithe Exo. 20. vnto all the people it was preachyd / not in an obſcure / ād darke place: but in the moūe / 

cletely and openly that noman ſhuld dout of it / as thowghe it came out of Trophonius caue / ſainct Patrice purgatory / or the priuey chambre of the Biſhope of Rome. Boothe the law / and the law yeuer / knowen of all the people. Minos was familier withe Iubiter / as the Poetis fayne. Numa had communication withe Aegera the Godes / but noman was record therof. He might therfare feyne what he liſt. As many ſuperſtitious hypocrates hathe donne. There apperyd vnto Gregorie a child in the bred of the aulter / the whiche viſition if it were trew was deuilliſhe / and wrowght by the deuill to deceaue the people of God. Brigitta ſaw like wyce in here contemplacions wounders. The Biſhoppes in there decretalles ſeyth like wice meruelles and miſteris that noman elſe can ſe: except he be ſworen to renownce Godes lawes. For they teache one faythe / and the goſpell an other / one kynd of godd workes and Chriſt an other.
               This law / is of an other ſort / and perfection. Openly manifeſtyd by God / not vnto one prynce or lernyd man / not vnto 12. or 70. heddes and principalles among the people: but vnto all the hole congregation / and not ſodenly but with great deliberation / and preparation of the people for the ſpace of thre dayes: Exod. 19. this law therfore Moſes would the pedple to

eſteme as a thing of all thinges mooſt to be eſtimyd. As they do nothing at all / that ſay the Scripture containithe not / all neceſſarie doctrine for the healthe of man. But nedithe mannes decres.
               The ſixt preparatiue is a trewe / and right vnderſtanding of the lawe. Not to conſtrayne the letter agaynſt the mynd of the text / but behold allwaies the conſent of the Scripture / and to do no wrong vnto the auctor therof. Somme men call this a diſpenſation of the law: when the extremite therof cannot with iuſtice / and equite / be excutyd agaynſt the tranſgreſſour / as we ſe Deut. 4. where Moſes appoyntythe certayne Cites / to be as refuges / or ſanctuaries for them / that be chance or agaynſt there will ſhuld happen to kill ony man. The law is / that who ſo euer ſhed the blud of man ſhall ſatisfye the law withe his blud agayne: Gene. 9. Matt. 26. Apoc. 13.
               This law extendithe not as farre as the wordes ſound: 
                     •
                  ut as farre as the mynd of the letter permittithe. that is to ſay vnto ſouche as of hatred / raſhe / and willfull maddenis / or to ſatisfie an ile and vndigeſtid paſſion / that hatythe his neighboure / killythe his neighbour / cō
                  temnithe God in the ſuperiour powres / who ſhuld reuerenche and puniſhe the ile doar / and not he hym ſelfe. Thoſe / and ſouche like / ſhuld

ſuffie deathe agayne: and not ſouche as kyllagaynſt there will. Thus doothe the ſcripture of God interpretat it ſelfe / and ſhewithe how euery law ſhuld be vnderſtand. The whiche is a very neceſſary rule / and precept / to be all wayes obſeruyd euery where / leſte the rigure / and forſe of the letter ſhuld do iniuries vnto ony circumſtaunce of the text. therefore I would euery man in the r
                     •
                  ding of the Scripture / ſhuld mark too thinges / in euery doutfull text.
               Fyrſt the conſent of other places: then the allegorie of the letter. as for an example. Thys propoſition / Matth. 26. this is my bodye: fyrſt loke the other places of the ſcripture / what chryſtes body is / and what qualites it hathe / how it was conceauyd and born / and whether it is aſcendyd: then thow ſhalt by the conſent of other places / be conſtrayed to vndreſtond theſe wordes according to the analogie / or proporſion of faith / and not after the letter. then conſider by the ſcripture why Chriſt by an Allegory / callyd the bread his body / and the wynne his blud. then it ſhalbe eaſy to vnderſtand / that they be rather confirmations of our faythe / then the body it ſelfe. Sacramentes / and memorialles of the thynges paſte / and not the thyng they repreſent / and ſignifie. Rom. 4.
               The ſeuenthe preparatiue is / to add nothing

vnto this law nether to take ony thing from it. who can be a conuenient diſciple of God / and his doctrine / that belyuithe not all thinges / and euery thing neceſſarie / for the ſaluation of man / to be contaynid openlie / and playnely / in the ſcripture Canonicall. or how can he be a Chriſtiane man that beliuithe one commaundement of God / and not the other. He that ſayd / thow ſhalt haue but one God / ſaythe likewyce / thow ſhalt nether add / ner take ony thing from the ſcripture / Deutt 4. but ſhalt obſerue it / at it is yeuen. ſo ſayd Chriſt Matt. 28. ſo ſaythe ſaynct Ion. cap. 21. like wice in the reuelations of Ieſus Chriſt oure redemer cap. 22. What is more neceſſarie for him that will reade the ſcripture / or hyre it preachid / then this preparatiue. Fyrſt to be perſwadyd that all verite / and neceſſarye doctrine for oure ſaluation is contaynyd there in / and that the holy churche of the Patriarches / Prophetis / and Apoſtelles beliuid / preachyd / and died for the ſame / and in the ſame doctrine. if thy hart be not thus preparyd: but iudgiſt that godes law cōteynithe one part of ſouch doctrine as is neceſſary for mannes ſaluation: and the Biſhopes lawes an other part: thow cō
                  temniſt and diſhonoriſt the hole law / and yeuer therof / and offendiſt the commaundement yeuen Deut. 4.12. and Prouerb. 30. rede diligentlie thoſe places. farther remembre that this opinion

is ſo vngodlie that the hole ſcripture endithe with this ſentence if ony man add vnto the word of God / God will put vpon him / all the maledictions conteynid in the booke. and if ony man demyniſhe ony thing / of this prophetie / God will take from him ſouche part as he hathe in the booke of liffe Apocalip. 22.

               THis precept or Commaundement hathe too membres. The fyrſt requirithe that we accept / accompt / and take the God that made / and perſeruithe all thinge / the God Saday / omnipotēt / and ſufficient / not onlie to be God: but alſo to be oure God / that helpithe vs / ſuccurrithe vs / ſauithe vs / and onlie defendithe vs. The ſecund part for byddithe all falſe godes. This fyrſt part is the ground / originall / 

and fundation of all vertewe / godlie lawes or Chriſtiane workes. and where as this precept and cōmaundement is not fyrſt layde / and takē as thonly well where of ſpringithe all othere vertews / whatſoeuer be donne ſeme it neuer ſo glorious / ād holie vnto the worold it is nothīg but very ſuperſticion / and hypocriſye as Paule ſaythe / Ro. 14 Ebr. 11. What puttithe differēce betwene the deathe of Socrates / and Eſaias: Diogenes / and Hieremie: Sophocles / ād Zacharie Euripides / and Steuine: Homere / and ſaint Iohn Baptiſt: ſauing onlie the knolege / and cōfidence in this cōmaundement: I am the lord thy god. what differēce where there betwene the Churche of the phariſes / ſcribes / and Hypocrites / ād the churche of god were not the knolege of this cōmaundemēt. that containithe too mooſt neceſſarie thinges. The trew knolege of God▪ and the trew honor of god Deu. 4.12. Exod. 19.20. Gē. 12.17.

                  nto all godlinis: ſouche a ſparkell / and dimme light notwithſtonding remaithe in the ſoule / that oure awne cōſcience criethe out againſt vs / whē we vtterly contēne / the reuerence / and diuine maieſtye of God: as it apperithe by the horrible / and ferfull deathe / of ſouche

as thowght it more eaſye to deſtroy there awne liuing bodies / then to endure the conflict and dolours of there awne conſcience withe the iudgment / and contempt of Godes lawes / as it is to be ſeene leuing profane exēples a part in Saul / and Iudas: withe all other ſouche in oure time / that ar the cauſers of there awne deathe. The ſubtiltes of the deuill muſt be takē hede of therefore / and knowen betime / leſt he ſhew vs God in an other forme then he ſhewithe himſelfe in his word and this cōmaundement. Where he ſaithe that he is oure God. to ſay: as well redie to puniſhe vs / if we cōtemne him: as to healpe vs if we loue him. The deuill goithe a bout an other thing: ād would all mē / as lōg as they haue a purpoſe / and bent will to ſynne / thinke that God is a mercifull God / agentle / ſwete / and fyggie god / that winkithe / and will not ſee thabhomination / and accuſtomid doing of ile. but when the conſcience felithe the diſpleaſure of God and ſekithe redreſſe / he amplifyithe / and exaggeratithe the greatnis of ſinne / ſhewithe it as fowle / ād as horrible as it is in deade / ād more. extenuatithe the mercie of god / makithe him / thē a cruell / and an vnmercifull tirāt / as impoſſible to optaine mercie of / as to ſucke water out of the drie pumpeſſe / or burning cole. Wherfore ſeing his maieſtie is inuiſible / and cannot be knowen of mortall man as he is: and like wyce be cauſe man yeuythe litle credit / 

or none at all vnto his blyſſid word he preſentia the all his workes / heuen / and Erthe vnto mā / to be teſtimonies / and wyttnis of his great powre / that man ſeyng thoſe creatures / and wounderfull preſeruation of the ſame / might thinke of god the maker of all thinges / and thanke him withe all the hart: that he would ſay theſe wordes vnto him vile creature / and wormes mete. I am the lord thy God. by his workis he ſhewid himſelfe thus vnto Adame Gen. 2. ād vnto the naturall phi. Ro. 1. alſo vnto euery reſonable mā Deu. 30. how be it ſo far hathe the deuill blindid many (would to God only the infideles / and not ſouche as be accomptid Chriſtians) that they take as mouche knolege of God by the contemplation of his workes / as Midas the knig by the contemplation of his gold. Wherfore ſeing we belyue with ſouche difficultye this worde of God / I am the lord thy God: and the deuill hathe blindfoldyd / and darid oure ſight / and ſo be wicchid all oure ſenſes / that we hyre / nor ſee ony thing to the glory of God / and ſaluation of oure ſaules: he addithe yet other teſtimonies to acertaine vs that he is oure God. and leuīthe nothing vndon / that might drawe vs vnto a firme / and conſtant biliue in him: ſetting before oure Iyes the glorious and wounderfull deliuerance / and defence of the people: whē he browght them our of Aegypt. ſouche teſtimonyes

addyd he vnto his word / to ſtabliſhe oure faithe allwaies. to Adame / and Abell / whē the fyre from heueane / burnid there ſacrifice Gene. 4.9.17. Exod. 12. ſo vnto vs: vnto whō he hathe yeuen the ſame word Ro. 1. hathe yeuen for the confirmation therof his dere ſonne Ieſus Chryſt / born / ded / and reſuſcitatid from deathe to ſhew vs him ſelfe and to teache vs that he is our God to ſawe vs from the ſeruitude of hell / and ſinne / and to healpe vs as many times as we call vnto him in chriſtes name. for only in him we cum to thacknolege of God that hewill be oure God. Thowghe the Iew / and the Turke / know there is but one God / and after there religion would honor him: yet dout they whether he takith cure of them / will hyre there 2peticions / wil be honorid of them / and how he wilbe be honorid. for they haue not the word of God / as Chriſt gaue it but as they falſely interpretat it / to the contumelie / and diſhonor of Chriſt. But we know him to be oure God as this commaundement ſaithe: in Chriſt Ieſu / Ioan. 1. Matt. 11. Io. 16. When we haue a trew knolege of him by his word / we muſt yeuen him the ſame honor / that his commaundement requirithe / to ſay: obedience and fere / faythe / and loue. Repete the wordes agayne of the commaundement / and marke them. I am the lord / thy God. if he be lord: then hathe he powre ouer

body and ſoule: obey him therfore leſt he deſtroy them boothe. thy God if he be God / all thinges be in his powre / and hathe ſufficient / boothe for the / and all other / and will yeue it the / becauſe he is thy god. he nedithe for him ſelfe nether heauen / nether Earthe / nor ony thing / that is there in▪ ād to put the out of dout therof / he browght not onlie the people out of Aegipt / to warant his promiſſe: but alſo ſend his only ſonne / to dye for thy ſake / that he might be thyne / and thow hys. Rom. 6. Eſa. 53. Theffect now of this part of the commaundement is: to declare / and bring man vnto a knolege of God as ye ſe. and ons knowen by his word / requirithe alſo mannes dewtye / to honor him / in trew / and perfete religiō. the whiche cōſiſtythe in fere / faythe / and loue. the whiche thre poyntes Moſes diligētlie / and at large declarythe / in the 6.7.8.9.10.11. Chapiters of Deut. and doothe nothing elſe in all them / but expound this fyrſt commaundement. I will ſhew the partlie how / and then rede the places / and lerne more by thy ſelfe. In the begymyng of the 6. chapiter he ſhewithe wherfore thow ſhuldeſt fere him / and kepe his cōmaundementes / ſayng it ſhalbe to thy profet. this is the maner of all men / that would haue

In the end of the 6. chapiter of Deu.

Therfore ſaithe Moſes: Audi Iſrael, dominus Deus noſter unus eſt, That is to ſay: Hire O Iſrael / the lord / oure God / is one God. Deut. 6. in this one God / thow ſhalt put all thy truſt / and belyue. To perſwade this faythe into there hartes Moſes put not onlye the deliueraunce out of Egypt before there facis / But alſo the Seuen mooſt mighty princes of the worold. Hittheum.

Deut. 7. and in the ſame chapiter he repitithe and inculcatythe into the ere this religiō and faythe / ſaing / ſcias itaque quod dn̄s Deus tuus ipſe eſt Deus, Deus fidelis &c. That is to ſay / know thow that the lord / thy God / he is thonly / and trew God / and ſo forthe. Then rede vnto the end of the 11. chapiter how buſie and diligent Moſes is / hepyng argument / vpon argument to perſwade the people to belyue God / and his word / and to ſtabliſhe this commaundement / and rout it in there / and oure hartes. All the workes of God heauen and Erthe / all the Miracles wrowght in the old Teſtament / and in the newe were donne to proue vnto mortall man this precept to be trew. I am the lord / thy god / and be none other thing but interpretations of this commaundement

to ſtabliſhe the verite of his word. The thyrd is loue / wherfore he ſaythe loue the lord / thy God with all thy hart / all thy ſoule / ād with all thy poure Deut. 6. Moſes in thend of the chapiter / ſhewith wherfore this oure God ſhuld belouid. he will giue youe ſaithe he the lād that ye neuer deſeruyd frely for his promiſſe ſake. ād in the 7. chapiter / he promiſithe to deſtroy a people more ſtrong then they be. in the 8. chapiter he ſaithe that he fed them in the wildernys / withe met from heauen / whyche they / nether there fathers neuer knew. By theſe and other many reaſones / he prouokyd the people to this part of religion / the loue of God. In caſe ony benefactour / or he that doithe good to an other / be to be louyd / ſpetiallye this oure god is to belouyd ſaythe Moſes. We may like wyce conſider his benefytes to wardes vs and ſo expulſe this deteſtable and horryble vnkyndenis towardes him. As is the leauyng vnto vs of the ſcripture wherby we know his bleſſyd will for the grace of the holie goſt that ledithe vs to knolege / defendithe vs from ile / and preſetuithe vs in vertew. The greatiſt Argument of all / the byrthe / and deathe of his only ſonne / yeuen for oure redemption. Then doothe Moſes teache how we ſhuld loue him / Deut. 6. with all oure hart / all oure ſoule / and all oure forſe. Of theſe partes cōſyſtythe man for the hart is the origynall of all

affectes and deſires. when the law requirithe the loue of God with all the hart / it requyrythe all mßnes affections to be ſyncere ād pure / and holy directyd into the loue and obedience of God. For he is a gelous God: he is not content with the fourthe part / or the halfe / but requyry the the hole hart mynd / will / affectious and liefe of man. He is not content that we loue him / withe one part / and the worold withe the other. Theſe wordes for byddythe not / but that we may loue oure honeſt frendes / parentes / and other as it is wroten / Exod. 20. Deut. 5. ſo that there loue be in God / and for God: not equall / nor aboue the loue of God. if Election happen / that in the louyng of the one / folow the hatred of the other: thow art bound to hate thy father / thy frendes / and alſo thyn awne liffe for the loue of God / Mat. 10. laſt of all thow muſt loue him with all thy forſe. by the whiche word is vndreſtond all the powres boothe of bodye and ſoule / the ſenſes interioure / and exteriour what ſo euer they be and as the holye goſt hathe yeuen them. ſo that nether the inward man / nether the vtwarde man be defylyd by ſynne / as Saynct Paule ſaythe 1. Theſſal. 5. Theſe wordes muſt be thowght apond: that man aplye the yefft of the holye goſt aright to the glorye of God and profet of his churche: wherof we be all membres. one hathe the yeffte

of prophetie / to iudge of thinges to cum: an other of knolege to open the miſterijs hyd in the ſcripture / an other the yeft to confort and yeue conſolation to the afflyctyd / thother the yeffe trewly to diſpence and diſtribute the goddes of this worold with out fraude / the other the yefte to perſwade by the word of God people to amē
                  dement of liefe withe the tong / an other withe the pen / one the gyfft to ſerue God in the miniſterye of the churche / the other to ſerue God in the miniſtery of the commune wealthe / the one apt and ſtrong / wiſſe and prudēt in affers of warr / the other to kepe good rule and gouerne in peace / thone apt to one thing / the other to an other. Euery man therfore remembre this commaundement. Loue God with all thy forſe: and applye the yefft that the holye goſt hathe yeuen the to the glorye and ſeruyce of God. it is an horrible ſynne before god / theabuſe of his yefftes whether they be of the bodye or the ſoule / Matt. 25. Moſes now as thow ſeyſt / hathe tawght vs to know God / and ſhewid vs how to honor him in faithe / fere / and loue: and ſhewyd many reaſones why whe ſhuld yeue him this honor and obedience: ſo that the fyrſt part of the fyrſt commaundement I am the lord / thy God: may be vnder ſtond of euery man that is willing to know God and his awne ſaluation. Before he expundithe the ſecond part of the commaundement.

Thow ſhalt haue no ſtrange Godes before me: he admonyſhythe the people of a very neceſſarye doctrine. That is to ſay: how they ſhuld behaue them ſelfes in proſperite and wealthe: and vſe the commodites of this worold. we know by experience and dayly proue that nothing more with drawithe man from the hononor / loue / and fere of God / then thoſe too. felicite / and aduerſite. As Chriſt teachithe oure ſauiour / Matt. 13. Marc. 4. Luc. 8. by the ſimilitude of him that ſowyd and part fell by the way ſyde / part vpon the ſtones / part amōg the thornes. by the ſede in the ſtonye ground Chryſt vnderſtondythe ſouche as leue his word for the calamites / and affliction of this worold. By the ſede among the thornes ſouche as here the word of God: how be it / it bringythe forthe no frute by reaſon of the cures of this worold / and decete of rychis. Moſes therefore ſhewithe like a good Prince and faythfull preacher what is to be don in boothe theſe ſtates / ād conditions of liffe. in proſperite / and aduerſite. ſo that if is conſell be folowyd: there is nether proſperite / nether aduerſite / can withe draw man: frō the will and pleaſure of god. The firſt doctrine to kepe man from the diſpleaſure of God in proſperite is wroten / Deut. 6. Erit cum introduxerit te dominus Deus tuus in terram, quam iurauit patribus tuis, Abraham, Iſaac, &

               That is to ſay / when the lord / thy god ſhall bryng the into the land / whiche he promiſyd to thy fathers Abraham / Iſaac / and Iacob / and ſhal yeue the / great cites and good whiche thow neuer buldyſt / howſes furnyſhyd withe all neceſſarys / whiche thow replenyſhyds not / and water pittes that thow dyggyſt not / uynes and olyues that thow plantyſt not / and thow eate and be ſatiſfiede beware thow for gote not the lord / that browght the out of Aegypt / from the howſe of ſeruauntes. Here ſeiſt thow what danger and perill is anexyd whith abundaunce ād proſperous fortune in this worold / and how commune an ile it is: in maner takyng effect in all men that poſſeſſythe the goddes of the worold. As Eſai ſaithe: let us eat and drynke / to morow we ſhall die. As Moſes ſaythe Deut. 32. the people replynyſhyd thē felſes withe the gyfftes of god / and rebellyd / vſing proſperite and god fortune for ſoke god. And Luc. 12. the ryche man ſayde. My Soule thow haſt great ryches and ſhalt vſe them many yers: take thyn eace / 

eat / drynke / and be merye. By theſe examples thow ſeyſt that Moſes preſcribyd not with out cauſe this regle / how to vſe oure ſelfes in proſperite. The whiche rule contaynythe too preceptes: thone to vſe moderatlie the yefftes of god / and not to abuſe them: the other to acknolege them to cum from god and to put no truſt in them. The ryches of the worold abuſyd engē
                  drythe pryde / and for gotefullnys of god. Therefore Moſes admonyſhythe Chefelye man in his wealthe to be ware he forgote not god. And in the 8. cap. he ſhewithe the cauſe why we ſhuld not glorye / nor truſt in thē / allthowghe they be muſt iuſtlye and rightwyſly goten. god yeuythe thē ſaithe he / and be not gotē with oure labours and payne. I know what men ar wont to ſay. when hard ony of theſe new goſpellers that aryche man acknolegid not god for god / ād cōfeſſe the ſame vnto other. So mouche may euery man that is not out of his wytt cōfeſſe. Dauyd ſaythe not / the foole ſaythe withe his tong there is no god / but in his hart pſal. 12. verely to acknolege only god to be God / only to truſt vnto him / and not vnto the creatures of the worold it is a rare thing in proſperite. few thincke by how ſmale a threde all the certayntye of ryches hangythe / and that ſodenly they may peryche. then ſhuld man mooſt ſuſpect the fortune of this worold whē ſhe ſmylyth mooſt / be cauſe

ſhe is brytytl and vnconſtant as the Poet Horace teachith when proſperite promiſithe ſecuryte and reſt in the goddes of this worold: it is a hard thing / and rare / verely to think only God to be the yeuer therof / and can ſodenlye take the thinges away that hathe bē gather withe great paynes and trauelles. Therfore he makithe many tymes of Aryche man / apowre man / of one that ruled all / contemnyd of all / of Creſus Irꝰ. and ſo puniſhithe becauſe men folowithe not this precept and commaundement of Moſes abuſe not the yeſtes of God / and for gote hym not in the tyme of proſperite. The other impediment that ledithe vs from this religion of God fere / faithe / and loue: is aduerſite. wherof he ſpekithe cap. 8. Deut. God led the xl. yers in the deſert / to puniſhe the / an to tēpt the / to know what was in thy hart whether thow wouldeſt kepe his commaundemēt or not. Puniſhyd the / and ſuffrid the to hungre / fed the from heauen whithe met thow knewiſt not / nether thy fathers knew not / to declare vnto the that mā onlye leuithe not by bred but by all thinges that procede from tht mouthe of God / lyuith man. when mā is oppreſſyd withe aduerſites / ād troble in this liefe: then commithe thowghtes as thicke as haile whether God loue him that is puniſhyd: diſputithe why ād what ſhuld be the cauſe of theſe trobles / and aduerſite / then he reuoluithe / toſſithe

/ and turnithe boothe the nature of God and man in his cogitations: knowithe God to delite in doyng well vnto man / and that man of all creatures is the mooſt excellent. he fyndithe God ſeuere / and of all creatures / man mooſt miſerable / and ſubiect to aduerſites. and the more man applyethe vnto the commaundementes of God: the more miſeris of this worold ar hepyd vpon his hed. it is not therfore with out cauſe that Moſes preſcribythe a remedy / leſt man ſhuld depart / being in the thrall and brake of aduerſite from this religion / fere God / beliue in God / and loue God. Moſes would kepe man in his obedience / and offyce towardes the law in declaryng the cauſes why God punyſhithe. Shewythe that it is for no hattred that he puniſhyth but for loue. and that he fyndythe all wayes in man / iuſt mater worthy puniſhemēt as Paule ſaythe Ro. 5. that deathe by reaſon of ſynne entrid into the worold / ſo that the integrite and perfetnis of mannis nature by ſynne is looſt / and made like vnto the nature of the brute beſtes / frutes / and herbis of the fyld. Iob. 14. and Iſay cap. 22.40. Eccl. 14. Pſal. 102. therefore god for ſynne being angre / puniſhithe the miſerable nature of man being ſpoylid of his oryginall and fyrſt perfection withe many calamites as Dauid ſaythe Pſal. 89. Defecimus in ira tua. That is aſmouche to ſay / thow being angre

for ſynne we arre ſubiect vnto deathe. Rede the hole pſalme if thow canſt. it is Moſes praier wher in is declaryd how bryffe / and miſerable the liefe of man is for ſynne. vnto this naturall corruption is annexid oure wilfull malyce and contempt of God / as we ſe in Cain / and Eſau / like wyce in this people of Iſrael / whiche were diligently inſtructyd / and godly browght vppe by Adame / Iſaac and Moſes: yea in oure ſelfes that dayly rede and here the word of God yet nothing the better. Therfore Moſes ſaythe that God led them in the wilder / nys to puniſhe there ſynne. Whiche is the pryncipall cauſe of all calamites. then puniſhythe he to proue ſouche as be his / whether they will perſeuer withe his commaundement or not. Thus temtyd he Abraham / and Iacob for the ſpace of all his liefe. and laythe more aduerſites many tymes vpon ſouche as be of his trew churche then vpon other / As theſe examples declare. Manaſſes the tyraunt cut Eſai the prophet a ſondre with a ſawe / Apryes killyd Hieremie The Byſhopes Zacharie / Herode Iohn Baptiſte / withe other. When ſouche aduerſites happen: let noman depart from the trew word of God / but ſay withe Micheas the prophete cap. 7. I will ſuſtayne the puniſhement of God / for I haue offendyd him. withe Eſa. 64. cap. behold we haue offendyd / and long contynewid

in ſynne wherfore thow art angre. God when he puniſhyth: workythe too godd deades at one tyme. Corectyth the ſynne / and callythe the ſynner to penaunce / as we haue Examples in Dauyd / Oſias and Manaſſe. and ſaynct Paule ſaythe 1. Cor. 11. We ar punyſhid of the lord / leſt we ſhuld be damnyd withe the worold. if thow be a godd man / and yet punyſhyd / reyoyce: for the punyſhement is a teſtimonie of the doctrine / and religion that thow profeſſiſt / and haſt many felowes. The patriarches / prophetes / Chriſt / and the Apoſtelles / whiche would rather ſuffre deathe / then deny the profeſſion of the goſpell / Matt. 16.2. Tim. 3. Pſal. 123.115. There be many other cauſes why God puniſhythe / and why the punyſhmentes ſhuld be patientlie taken / It were a booke mater to reherſe them. I will only ſpeke of one cauſe more that Moſes wrytithe in the ſame 8. cap. and paſſe ouer the reſt. God made thē hungre / and fed them withe mere from heauen / that they ſhuld know / man lyuyd not only by bred: but of all thinges / that procede from the mouthe of God. Some men vndreſtond that Moſes menythe that the body lyuithe withe bred corporall / and the ſoule withe the word of God / ſeing that man conſiſtythe of thoſe too partes: the body / and the ſoule. It is trew / and a godd interpretation / how

be it / if theſe wordes be referryd only to the body in this place of Moſes / it ſhalbe conſonaunt withe the circumſtaunce of the text / and declare his purpoſe the better. Thowghe man put mete into his body that of his one nature men iudge to noriſhe / yet except the fauoure and grace of God digeſt / and diſpoſe it / into euery membre of the body / it noriſhithe not: as we ſe in mony men that eatithe mouche and many times in the day: yet is nothing the ſtronger. The phiſitions call this diſeace apepſian / cruditatem whē there is no digeſtion at all ſomtyme diſpepſian Deprauatam concoctionem / when the mete is turnyd in to a contrary qualite. ſomtime vrady pepſian / Tardam concoctionem. When the ſtomacke digeſtythe withe difficultie and long protract of tyme. this I ſpeke only to this purpoſe that nether mete / nether medycine / nether phiſition a vaylithe: except God ſay amē. if thow wilt take profet of the thyng thow eatyſt: folow the phiſycke of Paule 1. Tim. 4. ſpeking of the met. ſanctificatur per ſermonem Dei, ac precationē. it is ſanctified by the word of God and prayer. it is not onlie lawfull for the to eate it / but alſo God will yeue the noriſhmēt. That the met and dryng fedythe not the body withe out the fauor and blyſſing of God: it is declarid Leuit. 26. Oſe. 4. Miche. 6. ye ſhall eat and yet not be ſatiſfied. Thus doothe Chryſtis Anſwer vnto the deuill

proue Mat. 4. when he vngryd in the body and not in the ſoule. Therfore his anſwer muſt be referryd only to the body. Godes puniſhmēt therfore tawght the Iſraelitis this doctrine that God yeuithe not only mete / but alſo vertew there vnto to noriſhe him that eatythe. Seing now that the Iſraelites by aduerſite were browght vnto the knolege of there ſynne and inſtructid withe this farther doctrine that God yeuithe as well vertew vnto the mete to noriſhe him that eatithe as the mete it ſelfe: there is no occaſion that they ſhuld therfore leaue god / but rather accept the puniſhment withe thankes as a good ſcole maſter ſend to teache them there he al

commaundement.

we in uocaſe repreſēt / or manifeſt the god inuiſible / and incōprehenſible withe ony figure / or ymaige / or repreſēt hī / vnto our ſenſes that can not be cōprehēdid / by the witt of mā nor angel.

Remēbre ſaithe he / to the people: that the lord ſpake to the in the vale of Oreb: thow hardiſt a vaice / but ſawiſt nomaner ſimilitude / but only a vaice (hardiſt thow) Eſa. cap. 40.41.45.46. diligētlie ſhe withe / what an abſurdite / and vndecēt thing it is to prophane the maieſtie of god incōprehēſible withe a litle block or ſtone: a ſprit / with ā ymayge. The ſame doothe Paule / act. 17. the text therfore for biddithe all maner of ymagys / that ar made / to expreſſe / or repreſent allmyghtie God.
               The ſecond part for byddithe to honor ony ymayge made.
               The firſt word honor / ſignifijthe: to bow hed legg / kne / or ony part of the body / vnto thē / as all thoſe do / that ſay they may with good conſcience / be ſuffrid in the churche of Chriſt. To ſerue them / is to do ſomme what for there ſakes / as to ſenſe them withe incenſe / to gild / to runne on pylgrymayge to them / to knele / or pray-before them / to be more affectionat to one / then

to the other / to ſet lightes before them withe ſouche like ſuperſticion and Idolatrie. God be preacyd / I may be ſhort / or writ nothing at all in this mater / becauſe ſouche as I write vnto / my countre men: be perſwadid all redy aright in this commaundement.
               This ſecond part ſhewithe vs / how Idolatrie procedythe / and takythe place in mennys cō
                  ſcience. The mynd of man when it is not illumynatid with the ſpryt of God / nor gouernyd by the ſcripture / it ymaginythe / and faynithe god / to be like vnto the ymagination / and concept of his mynd / and not as the ſcripture teachythe. When this vanyte / or fond ymagination is cō
                  ceauyd in the mynd / there folowithe a farther ſucceſſe of the ile. he purpoſythe to expreſſe / by ſommne fygure / or ymaige / God in the ſame forme / and ſimilitude / that his ymagination hathe fyrſt pryntid in his mind. ſo that the mind conceauythe the Idole / and after ward the hād workythe / and repreſentythe the ſame / vnto the ſenſes.
               Therfore / God fyrſt for biddythe / this inward / and ſpirituall Idolatrie / of the mynd / when he ſaythe / thow ſhalt haue no ſtrange Godes before my face. if the mind be corruptyd and not perſwadid a right: then folowithe the making of ymaiges / and after / the honoring of them. The cauſe therfore of externall Idolatrie

is internall / and inward ignoraunce of God / and his word / as Lactantius wrytithe in his booke / of the oryginall of errour. As it cannot be other wyſe / but where as the ayre is corruptid / there muſt folow peſtilence / and infection of the blud Galen. lib. 1. De diffe. feb. cap. 5. So where the mynd is not purely perſwadid of god / muſt folow this groſſe / and ſenſible Idolatrie / that wold honor God in an Idole. The oryginall cauſe why the ar made is / that man thinkythe / God would not be preſent / to healpe him / except he be / preſentyd ſomwayes vnto the recarnall Iyes / as the example of the Iſraelites declarythe. that requiryd Aron to make thē Godes / that might lede them in there Iourney.

                  hey thowght / he would not be preſent / and at hand with them / except they might ſe him in ſomme corporall fygure / and ymaige / and that the ymayge / might be a teſtimony of his preſence. ſo ſe we that noman fallithe into this groſſe Idolatrie: but ſouche as be fyrſt infecryd with a falſe opynion of God / and his word. then ſay they / they wourſhippe not the ymaige / but the thing repreſentid by the ymaige. againſt whom writithe ſainct Auguſtine in Pſal. 118. et 113. in the 4. booke of the cite of God cap. 5. that ymaiges take a way

fere from men / and bring them into errour. The aunciant Romaines more religiouſlie ſaythe he / honoryd there godes / withe out ymagis. Seing there is no cōmaundement / in ony of the boothe teſtamētes / to haue ymagis / but as ye ſe the cōtrarye. ād likewice the vniuerſall / catholike / and holie churche / neuer vſid ymagis / as the wrytinges of the apoſtelles / and prophetis / teſtifie: it is but an ethnicke verite / and gentiles Idolatrie / to ſay / God and his ſainctes be honoryd in them / when that all Hiſtories teſtyfie / that in maner ffor the ſpace of fyve hundryth yers / after Chriſtes aſcenſiō / when the doctrine of the goſpell was mooſt ſincerly preachid / was no ymagy vſyd. would to God / the churge were now / as purely / and well inſtructid / as it was before theſe auaricious miniſters / and dōme doctors of the lay people / were made preathers / in the churche of god. Rede Auguſt. Epiſt. 49. et Pſal. 113. therfore ſaynct Iohn biddith vs / not only beware of honoring of ymagy / but of the ymagis ſelfes. Thow ſhalt fynd the origynall of ymagis ī no part of godes word: but in the wrytinges of the gentiles / and infideles / or in ſouche that more folowid there awne opinion / and ſuperſtitious ymaginations / then the auctorie of Godes word. Herodotus li. 2. ſaythe that the Aegyptions / were the fyrſt that made ymagys / to repreſent there Godes. and as the gentiles faſhenyd

there godes withe what fygures / the lyſtyd: ſo doothe the Chryſtians. to declare God to be ſtrong / they made him the forme of a lyon. to be vigilant / and diligent / the forme of a dogg. and As Herodotus ſaythe libr. 2. Mendeſij / formyd there God Pana withea gotes face / and gotes legges / and thowght thei did there god great honor / becauſe among thē / the herd men of gotes / were had in mooſt eſtimation. So doothe thoſe that would be accomptyd chriſtianes / peynt God / and his ſaynctes with ſouche pyctours as they ymagine / in there fantazies. god like an old man / with a horehed / as thowghe his vthe were paſt / whiche hathe nether beginning / nor ending. S. George / with a long ſpere / vpon a Iolie hakeney / that gaue the dragon his deathe woūd (as the Peinters ſay) in the throwght. Sainct whit with as many round cheſes / as may be peītid a bout his tabernacle. No differēce at all betwene a chriſtiane mā and gentille in this Idolatrie / ſauing onlie the name. for they thowght not there ymagis to be god / but ſuppoſid that there godes would be honorid that waies / as the chriſtianes doothe. I writ theſe thinges rather in a contempt / and hatred of this abhominable Idolatrye / then to lern ony Engliſhe man / the truythe. For my belyue / and hope is / that euery man in Englond / knowith prayng to ſaynctes / 

and knelyng before ymagies / is Idolatrie. and inſtrumentes of the deuill / to lede men / from the commaundementes of God. And that they ar apoyntid in many places to be as doctours to teache the people: theſe doctors / and doctrine the biſhopes / and paſtors / ſhall bewaile / before the iudgment ſete of god / at the hore of deathe. and like wice the princes of the worold. Who is office is / daily to rede / and lerne the ſcripture / that they them ſelfes / might be able to iudge the biſhoppes doctrine / and alſo / ſe them applie the vocation they ar callyd vnto. it is not only a ſhame / and an vndecent thing for a prince / to be ignorant what Curates his ſoubiectes hathe / throwghe all his realme / but alſo a thing ſo cō
                  trarie vnto the word of God / that nothing prouokythe more the Ire of god / againſt him / and his realme / then ſouche a contempt of godes cō
                  maundement.
               The thyrd part declarithe / that it is no nede to ſhew God vnto vs / by ymaiges. and prouithe the ſame / with thre reaſones / fyrſt. I am the lord / thy God: that louythe the / helpithe the / defendithe the / is preſent withe the. belyue and loue me / ſo ſhalt thow haue no nede / to ſeke me / and my fauorable preſence / in an ymaige.
               The ſecond reaſon. I am a Ielous god / and cannot ſuffer the to loue ony thyng / but in me / and for me. Whē we too were maryd / and knit

to gather / for the loue that I bore vnto the. I gaue the certayne rules / and preceptes / how in all thinges / thow mayſt kepe my loue / and goddwill towardes the / and thow promiſydes me obedience / vnto my commaundementes / Exod. 19. ſo honor me / and loue me / as it ſtādithe wroten in the writinges / and indētures wroten betwen vs boothe. I cannot ſuffre / to be other wyce honoryd / then I haue tawght in my tables / and Teſtament.
               The thyrd reaſon is that God reuenchithe the prophanatiō / of his diuine Maieſtie / if it be trā
                  ſcribyd to ony creature / or ymayge. and that not onlie in him / that committithe the idolatrye / but alſo in his poſteryte / in the third / and fourthe generatiō / if they folow there fathers idolatrie / as I yeue mercie / in to the thowſand generation / when the chyldre folow there fathers vertewe Then to auoyde the Ire of god. an to optaine his fauoure / we muſt vſe no ymaigis to honor him with all. this ye may rede Nu. 12. Ie. 32. ād Eſa. 39. how Kyng Ezechias ſonnes / looſt there fathers kyngdomme / an were caryd / into captiuite for there fathers ſinne.

but the damnable art mathematicall / is for bydden. The law menythe Aſtrologie / and Aſtronomie whiche ar vſyd well but of a few men. The Aſtrologer / is he that knowithe the courſe / and motions of the heauens / and teachythe the ſame / whiche is a vertew / if it paſſe not his bondes / and be come of an Aſtrologer / an Aſtronomer. who takythe vpon him to yeue iudgment / and Cenſure of theſe motions / and courſe of the heauens / what they pronoſticat / and deſtenye vnto the creatures of the earthe / man / beſt / and other. what ſhalbe the temperature of the ayre / the condition of the Erthe / the ſtate / and ſucceſſe of ſouche frute / as it bryngythe forthe. By this knolege they fore ſpeke of peſtilence / and other diſeacis / and ſeythe the deathe of great men to cum / and ſouche commotions / and warres / as ſhall folow / betwene the prynces of the wotold. And Thus they ſey they know / by the courſe of the heauens. Where as they ſethe coniunctions of many planetis of rygures / and fatall diſpoſition / and qualite concurre: by reaſone of whois influence / into theſe inferiour partes / all thoſe calamites muſt happen. Here they abuſe not only the name of God / and the Naturall diſcurſe of reaſon / whiche hathe comprehendid the motions / and courſe of heauens: but alſo heauens it ſelfe. and attribute vnto the heauens / 

the thing that onlie appertainithe to god: to ſai / the healthe of man / and ſichnis of man / the plē
                  tie of the earthe / and ſcarſite of the ſame. the regimēt of commune wealthes / and the lyffe and deathe of the gouerns therof. There knolege and practiſe in theſe thynges is nothyng att all: for allmightie god hathe not made the heauens / to that end / and purpoſe that man ſhuld lern of them / good fortune / or ile / as it is playne Gen. 1. in the ſecond daye God made the fyrmament / and the ſuperiour ſperes / whiche the text callythe rakiah. to this end / that it ſhuld ſeperat The waters that be vnder the firmament / from thoſe that be a boue the firmament. and God callid the firmament heauen. in the 4. daye God made the Sonne / the Mone / and the Sterres. And ſhewithe to what purpoſe / and end he made them. the one to haue dominion in the daie / the other in the night / and God put them in the f

The ſpring / Somer / Autumne / and wynter. They ar in ſignes like wyce ſaythe the text. The whiche the houſbound mā that tylythe / and ſowith the growne / obſeruithe withe out ſuperſticion / to ſowe / and repe his corn. he caſtythe it into the wynter / and receauythe it agayne in the Somer. So doothe

the Mariner / marke the reuolution of the Mone / his decreſe / and increſe wher by he knowithe the tydes / the Ebbe / and flow of the ſee. and the later phiſicions Auicenne / and Auerroys hathe like wice aſſignid there vſe in mannes bodye. Therefore they apoynt diuerſite of dayes / in the practiſe of phiſike. one to be more apt for letting of blud then other / to purge / and to balne / thē the other. If they may be obſeruyd without ſuperſtition / it may be ſuffryd. ſo notwithſtonding / that ſouche as obſerue not theſe later rules / may booth miniſtre / and receaue medicins. for the heuenes were made to ſerue vs / and not to maſter vs. were creatyd for man / and man not for them. Therfore it is a falſe ſuperſticion / to ſaye good / or bad / plentythe / or ſcarſite / ſicknes or elthe / warr / or peace / dependithe of the influence of the heauens. Or he that is borne vnder one ſigne / to be more fortunate / then he that is borne vnder the other / as this Egyptiacall / and Ethnycke folyſhnis / barythe men in hand. The Pronoſtication of theſe blynd Prophetis / is good to be born in a mannes beſōme to know the day of the monethe. The reſt of there practice / is not worthe one hawe / as Moſes teachithe / Deut. 28.29.30. Leuit. 26. Thre. 2. Malach. 2. Where as ye may ſe / that all theſe illes and many more / then the Aſtronomers ſpekythe of / commythe vnto vs for ſynne / and the tranſgreſſion

of Godes commaundement It is nether Sonne / nether Mone / Iupiter nor Mars / that is the occation / or mater of wealthe / or who / plentythe / or ſcarſythe / of warr / or pece. Nether is the cauſe of penitence the putrefaction of the ayre as Galenus wrytythe / libr. 1. De diffe. feb. cap 5. But the contempt of Godes commaundement is the cauſe / as thow maiſt rede in the chapiters of the ſcripture alitle afore reherſyd. The Ayre / The Water / and the Erthe hathe no poyſon in them ſelfes / to hurt there lord / ād maſter man. But fyrſt man poyſenithe him ſelfe with ſynn: and then God vſythe theſe Elementes ordeynyd for the lief of man / to be thoccation of his deathe. Rede the places and know that godd healthe is nom bred among the blyſſynges of God / and apperteynythe vnto thoſe that fere and kepe Godes Commaundementes / ād not to thoſe / that be deſtenyd to lyue lōg / by the fauour / ād reſpectes of planetes And the ile / of what kynd ſo euer it be / is the malediction of God / agaynſt ſynne. The phiſicians ſay that the chefyſt remedy agaynſt peſtilence is to fle from the place where the Ayre is corrupt.
               Godes law ſaithe / fle whether thow wilt. Adherere faciet tibi Dominus peſtilenciam, donec conſumat te de ſuperficie terrae, Deutero. 28. That is to ſay: The lord ſhall make the peſtilence

cleue and aſſociat the till it conſume the from the worold. Agayne in the ſame chapiter. the diſeace or ſyckenys ſhalbe faythefull. that is to ſay ſticke faſt to the / vſe what medicines thow wilt. Galenus ſaythe libr. 1. De differ feb. capit. 4. that the cheffe remedy / to preſerue from peſtilence / is to purge the body from ſuperflous humores / to haue a fre / and liberall wynd / and to auoyde the abundaunce of mete / and drynke. God ſaythe / nothyng preſeruythe / but the obſeruation of his commaundementes. If we offend / the beſt remedy is penence / and amendement of liefe. It makythe no forſe how corrupt the Ayre be / ſo the conſcience / of man in Chriſt be clene from ſynne. Thoghe there dye / a thowſand of the one ſyde of the / and ten thowſand one the other ſyde / thow ſhalt be ſauffe / Pſalm 90. He will let the lyue / to ſerue lenger in the worold / to the glorye of his name. And if tbow die / it is becauſe / no malice of the worold / ſhuld corrupt thy lieffe / and bryng the from God. Farther to take away the miſeries of this worold. If ſouche as care not for God / eſcape in the time of peſtilēce / or warr: it is to call them vnto a better lyffe / Ro. 1. If they amend not: they ar reſeruyd / to agreater payne. this is ſpokē not as thowghe I contēned the yefftes of god: philoſophie / and phiſick / but to: take from mē / all vaine hope in the artificiall medicyns

/ and yeue only the glory vnto the name of God.
               They abuſe the name of God / that performe not the thing they promes / in Godes name / by ony othe / or vow / made according to the law of God / whether it be betwene man and God / as in the holie Sacrament of Baptiſme / and the holie ſuper of the lord / where as we ſwere / and promes to lyeue after his will and pleaſure. Or when man / to man byndithē him ſelfe / to ony condicions / or promeſes by the inuocation of Godes name / or teſtimony of his awne conſciens. If the one kepe not touche and promeſe withe the other: he that offendith / abuſythe not only his awne faythe / whicht ſhuld be allwyes ſimple / and trew: but alſo contemnythe the Maieſtie / and omnipotencie of God / in whois name / the othe was taken.

               THe cauſe / and end / why this commaundement was inſtitutyd / is diuerſe. Fyrſt becauſe man ſhuld apon this daye call his intendement / and thowghtes from the luſtis / pleaſures / vanites / an concupiſcens of the worold vnto the meditacions of godd / and his workes / to the ſtudie of ſcripture herīg of the word of god / to call vpon God withe ardent praier / to vſe and exerciſe the Sacramentes of God / to conferr

/ and geue according to his abilite almoſe / to the confortyng of the poure. Then like wyce God by this commaundement prouidy the for the temporall / and Ciuile liefe of man / and like wyce for all thynges that be neceſſarie and expedient for man / in this liefe. if man / and beſt / that is mannes ſeruant / ſhuld without repoſe / and reſt / allwaies labour / they might neuer indure / the trauell / of the Erthe. God therfore / as he that intendithe the conſeruation / and wealthe of man / and the thyng creatyd to mannes vſe / commaundithe this reſt / and repoſe from labour that his creatures maye indure / and ſerue as well there awne neceſſarie affayrs / and buſynis / as preſerue the vthe / and offrynge of man and beſt / till it com to a ſufficient ayge and conuenient forſe / to ſupplie the place / and rome of ſouche as deathe / or diſeace ſhall pryuate / or diſable / from the execution / and vſe of ſouche trauelles as this carefull liefe ſhall neceſſaryly require. So ſaythe Ouid.
Quod caret alterna requie, durabile non eſt.
That is to ſay. the thyng cannot endure / that lakythe reſt. That man and beſt therfore / myght brethe and haue repoſe / this ſabbothe was inſtitutyd. Not onlye that the body ſhuld be reſtoryd vnto ſtrenghte and made able to ſuſtaine the trauelles / of the weke to cum / but alſo that the ſoule and ſprit of man / whiles the body is at reſt / 

myght / vpon the Sabbothe / lerne and know / ſo the blyſſid will of his maker. that onlye / it leue not from the labour / and aduerſite of ſynne: but alſo by Godes grace / receaue ſouche ſtrenghe / and forſe in the contemplation of Godes mooſt mercyfull promes / that it may be able / to ſuſtayne all the trobles of temptacion / in the weke that folowithe. for as the bodye being allwayes oppreſſyd withe labour loſtythe his ſtrenghe / and ſo peryſhythe: ſo doothe the mind of man / opproſſyd withe the cures / and pleaſures of this worold / looſt all here forſe / luſt / and deſyre that ſhe had to the reſt to cum of eternall liefe. And ſo dyethe not onlye the deathe of ſynne / but haſtythe what ſhe can / to hate / and abhor all vertewe. allmyghty God therfore not only in his commendementes / but alſo at the fyrſt creation of the worold / ſanctifyed the ſeuenthe daye / Gene. 2. that is to ſay / apoyntyd it to an holy vſe. or ſeparatyd it from other dayes / wherein men trauell in the buſynes of this worold. So is the meanyng of this Ebrew phraſe / or maner of ſpeache / as ye may rede Ioſuah 20. Capi. Sanctificauerunt Kades in Galilea. That is to ſay / they ſanctified Kades in Galilea. it is aſmouche to ſay in Englyſhe / they choſe / or apoyntyd the Citie of Kades / to be a refuge / or ſanctuarie for Murtherers

to be ſaufe there / till the cauſe of the murderer might be knowen. How be it / ye may not thynke that God gaue ony more holynys / to the Sabboth then to the other dayes. For if ye conſyder fryday / and Saturne day / Saturne day / or Sonday in aſmouche as they be dayes / and the worke of God / the one is nomore holye / then the other / Cod. lib. 3. Tit. 12. de Ferijs. but that day is allwayes mooſt holie / in the whyche we moſt applie / and yeue oure ſelfes vnto holie workes. To that end he ſanctifyed the Sabboth day. not that we ſhuld yeue oure ſelfes to ylnis / or ſouche Ethnicall paſtyme as is now vſyd among Chryſtyane people. But being fre that daye from the trauelles of this worold / we might conſyder the workes / and benefites of God withe thankes yeuyng. Here the word / and law of God. honor him / and fere hym. then to lerne / who / and where be the poure of Chryſte / our brothers in neceſſite that wantythe our healpe. The obſeruation therfore of the Sabboth / doothe extend aſwell vnto the faythe we haue in God / as vnto the cherite of oure neyghbour. And not only that / but alſo vnto the beſtes / that trauell in oure buſynys / and be our neceſſary ſeruantes. The whiche we ſhuld in no wyce abuſe / not only

for there labours ſake but alſo / for the loue of him / that hathe commendyd them / vnto oure ſeruice / allmightie God. Thyrdly the ſabboth hyther vnto from the begynnyng of the worold / was / and is a type / and fygure of the eternall / and euer laſtyng reſt / that is to com. as S. Paule diligently ſhewythe in the Epiſtole to the Ebrews cap. 4. ſo dothe. S. Aug. lib. 11. cap. 31. de Ciuit.

So may ye rede / Gene. 1. where the text ſaythe. it was euenyng / and it was mornyng / one dayt that is to ſay the fyrſt daye / Whiche we call the ſonday. and thus alſo ſaythe thoſe that were beſt lernyd in the tonges among Chriſtiane wryters. Ioan. Chryſoſt. Lactant. and Eraſmus. for the preſeruation of the trew meanyng of the word of God / and right vſe of his bleſſyd Sacramentes / he hathe yeuyn vnto the churche Apoſtelles / Prophetes / Paſtors / Doctors / and other / Epheſ. 4. That ſhuld teache vs the Scripture / and wrytynges of the Prophetes ād Apoſtelles / whiche was declarid to be trew / withe many ſignes / and tokens / that we ſhuld not wauer with euery wynd / and be caryd into errours by the doctryne of man. That we ſhuld not fayne new doctrine / out of our awne braynes / but belyue as the holye churche of the Patriarches / Prophetes / Chriſt / and the Apoſtelles

whiche tawght the people as they wrote / and wrote as they tawght / that noman after there deathe / ſhuld deceaue the people / that Chriſt redemyd withe his precious blud / with falſe / and impoſtorous doctrine. Thoſe Ethnyck and Iewyſhe doctors of the Pope / how ſo euer the Bragg of the Name of holye churche / be none other then the defenders of the Synagoge of Antechriſt.
               Sure we be that Chriſt / the Patriarches / Prophetes and Apoſtelles be ſauyd. and belyuyd no more / nor none other wyce / then they haue lefte vnto vs by writinges. Better it is to be certaine of oure doctrine / and ſaluation withe this holie churche / then to aſſociat our ſelfes with the rabull of lyers. that boſtythe / and braggythe there abhominable / and Ethnicall ceremonies / which be condemnyd in the ſcripture / to be lawes for the holye churche. God yeue the grace to rede the holie Bible / and to haue a litle vnderſtonding of it / then ſhalt thow ſe who / and where is / the holie churche / that theſe dreamers / attribute vnto there father the deuyll / and Antechriſt of Rome. And if they ſay vnto the / that thow muſt not take the text / after thy awne mynd / but after the mind of the holie Doctors / that hathe wroten in the ſcripture: thynck withe thy ſelfe / that God hathe yeuen the / the Scripture to rede therin / to thy ſuluation / as well / as vnto the Doctor. Farther that thy Doctor

preache not alie / for the truithe: god hathe yeuē the / the ſcripture to iudge thy Biſhope / doctor / preacher / ād curate whether he preache gall / or hony / his awne lawes or Godes lawes. Farther ſay boldly / and fere not / for it is trew / that in maters / and cauſes of wayght / the doctors agre not / one withe the other. No many tymes / not withe them ſelfes / as euery man knowithe / that hathe rede them / withe iudgment. and as godd Argumentes ſhalt thow fynd in them / to diſproue / as to proue / the thinges that this late found Catholicke churche of the deuill / would ſtablyſhe. Agayne thinck whiche was the mooſt pure churche / and fre from hereſis. The churche before the Doctors wrote / that only was tawght by the ſimple text / and wordes of the Apoſtelles / or the churge that hathe byn tawght this many yers by the blynd doctrine of men. thē thow ſhalt ſe that thoſe doctors that they ſpeake of hathe put out godes lawes and browght in there awne. as the phariſes and Rabbins did in the old churche. be not afraid of there holi name / but truſt to he holinis of ſcripture / thē ſhalt tho not be deceauid. they ſay the holie churche mooſt be hard / ād obeide: trew it is. but oure faithe is not groundid vpō thoſe / that be of the churche thowghe they be the trew miniſtres of Godes word. but vpon the word it ſelfe as it aperithe. Mat. 16. therfore whē the auctorite or teſtimone

of the churche / is alegyd: man that louythe his ſaluation / muſt ſarche where / and what the churche is: what tymes / and when / the wryters were mooſt ſyncere / and not belyue theſe yeſterdayes byrdes / that ſyng as the Papegay they know not what: as they be tawght out of a ſhamelis ſcole / that began withe murther / is mayntaynyd withe ſacrileige / and ſhalbe deſtroide with the clertye / and brightnis of the Sone of man / cumming to iudgment.
               In appertainithe vnto no man / in what auctorite ſo euer he be: to iudge who preachithe falſe / or who trew / but vnto the word of god onlie whiche īterpretatithe it ſelfe / whē it is with iudgmēt cōferrid. But of this / his requirid amore prolix worke: whiche God ſhall giue in tyme.
               Now the workes of this precept / be alſo theſe Godly to preache his word / and to vſe the ſacramentes as the reachithe in his word. to hire thē reuerently that trewly preachithe. To honor the word of God / and helpe to the preferment there of aſmouche as may be. to ſuccour the profeſſors therof whiche be / hathe bin and euer ſhalbe (if they preache trewly) in the mooſt miſerable condicion of the worold.

Thow ſaiſt: Cuſto diui uias dn̄i, necimpie geſſi ā Deo meo. That is to ſay: I haue kept the waies of the lord / and haue not departid by iniquite / from my God.

               Thus I haue rudely openyd the fyrſt table of the ten wordes that conteynythe iiij. commaundementes. The whiche diuiſion doothe Ioſeph. antiq. lib. 6. cap. 3. Origen. Homil. in Eyod. 8.

In the ſecond is for byd all externall Idolatrie. In the thyrd Externall profeſſion

of Godes name / his word / and his workes. as by prayer / thankes yeuing / preachyng / and confeſſing his trewthe before the worold. In the fourthe: how we ſhuld Honor him withe publike Sacramentes / and ceremonies in the churche. ſo in this Second table / is comprehendyd all ſouche workes as apertayne vnto God / and man. and in this table is preſcribyd how / and by what meanes / one man may lyue with an other in peace and vnite / in this Ciuile liefe / during the tyme / of this mortall bodie / vpon the Erthe.
               Many Noble wyttis hathe applied great diligence / and ſtudye / to preſcribe ſouche lawes as might beſt / and mooſt commodiouſlie gouerne and kepe the people / in a politike felicite. To lyue quietlye / proſperouſly / and wealthelie. as ligurcus the Lacedemonians / Solon / Plato / Ariſtotell / the Grekis. Numa Pomp. Cicero / and other / the Romaines. Amongeſt Chriſtianes / Conſtant. Iuſtin. and other. Thoſe men hathe dōne ſomwhat / to aſſotiat people in Cites / and Realmes by wyſdom / to kepe them in an honeſt order withe vertewſe lawes / and to remoue the occaſion of vyce / and diſcord by iuſtice.
               How be it none of themall / nor all they to gather / hathe not preſcribyd ſo perfet / and abſolute a forme of a politike wealthe / as allmyghtie God hathe donne vnto his people in this Second

table / and ſyx rules. Nether ſo equally ponderyd the diuerſite of ſynne / and tranſgreſſion of iuſtyce as this lawe doothe. not ſo indifferently preſcribe the correction and punyſhement according to the grauite and greatnis of the fault but is to cruell in the leſſe offence / and to mercyfull in the greater. As ye may ſe the iniuries of thefft punyſhyd / and blaſphemie of God / with adultery vnpunyſhyd.
               After that he had gatheryd togather this people into one company and multitude / browght them out of Aegypt / and apoyntyd them a lond and cites / where they ſhuld lyue / as membres of one commune wealthe. He preſcribyd vnto them / certayne lawes / without the whiche / no commune wealthe / can lōg indure. for it is no leaſe maieſtre to kepe a Royalme in wealthe / frō the dangers to cum: thē to wynne it frō aduerſite / whē aduerſiteis preſēt. The firſt law / to preſerue a cōmune wealthe is / that the people therof / know how to reuerence / and honor God a right who is the preſidēt / ād the defender of all cites / ād realmes. If he be neglectid / therfolowithe doutlis aruine, ād chāge of the cōmune wealthe. Thus ſaw all thoſe that wrot lawes / for the preſeruatiō there of not only Moſes / ād chriſtiane wyiters / but alſo the Ethnykes. Ariſt. li. 7. polit. ca. 8. Where as he Nūbrythe the workes to be dōne in the cite. Quintū, inquit, acprimū circa

aram diuinam, cultus quod ſacrificium uocant, that is to ſay. the fyghe and principall worke / is religion at the aulter of God. whiche mē call ſacrifyce. They knew / that no cite / nor Realme could contynew long in wealthe / except they had the fauour of God thowghe they could not tell / how to honor him a ryght. We like wyce know the ſame. the fauor of God / fyrſt and chefely to preſerue the commune wealthe Pſal. 127. Deut. 31. and be aſſuryd by his word how we may honor him / to ſay as it is towght vs / in the fyrſt table / and foure fyrſt preceptes.
               The ſecond law Neceſſary for euery commune wealthe is / that the people among them ſelues lyue in peace / and concord withe out diſcord / and diſſencyon. As Salluſt. ſaythe / Litle thynges by concord increſſethe / and great thynges by diſcord decreſſe. that ſaw the pore ſhepord Melibeus in Virg. when he ſayd:
En quo diſcordia ciues perduxit miſeros?
that is to ſay. lo whether (or into what miſeris) hathe diſcord browght the wrecchid citicens. Not onlie Rome / ād other mooſt noble cōmne wealthes / loſt there libertes / and thē ſelfes by diſcord / but alſo the cōmune wealthe of the Iſraelites as ye may rede 3. Re. 12. how of one kingdō / was made too for the diſcord / that god ſuffryd to be among thē ſelfes for the idolatrie of kyng Solomō 3. Re. 11. where as ye haue ā exāple that

no commune wealthe / can indure where as the preceptes of the fyrſt table be neglectyd. Allmyeghty God therfore / after that he hathe tawght the people / what is to be don towardes him in the fyrſt table: he ſhewythe in the Second table / what we ſhuld do one / to the other of vs. that peace / and concord myght be amonges vs. Whiche cannot be / where as one knoythe not / what reuerence / and honor ſhuld be don to the other. for where as all men wilbe lyke / there is nether wealthe / ner vertew: but contencyon / and hatred / whiche is the mater / and ground / of all calamites / and myſcheffe. The law of God therfore / in the fyrſt front of this Second table / doothe apoynt / and inſtitute a certayne Imperie / and dominion / to be had amōg his people that one perſon might be knowen from the other. Conmaundithe obedience vnto the ſuperoure powres / Sayng / Magnifie or reuerence thy father / and mother. if this order be kept / there is a reward apoyntid for the obſeruation therof / as the text ſaythe. thow ſhall lyue long vpon the erthe. after that people of a commune wealthe / know / eche of them there dewtes: it is neceſſarie / there folow a law to mayntaine them in peace / and vnite. therfore folowithe it / in the table. Thow ſhalt not kylle / whiche precept is / amunicion / and defence of the peace. How beit becauſe there folowithe alteracyon / and change

in euery cōmune wealthe / by reaſon of deathe / and the perſones preſent cānot liue for euer: the law maker for the commune wealthe / muſt prouide / how the places of thoſe that die / may be agayne furniſhid / that withe the departure / of one / may folow the ſucceſſe of an other. wherfore god puttithe the ſyxt canō / that defēdithe mariage wherby is preſeruid this cōmune wealthe ād as godly continewid as it beganne. the whiche law is not only neceſſary for the preſeruatiō of the cōmune wealthe to cū: but alſo to preſerue the ſtate preſent / in peace / ād tranquillite. for neuer was there greater occaſion of diſcord / ād bate / betwene cōmune wealthe / ād cōe wealthe / prince / ād prince / priuate perſones / ād priuate perſones: thē for thabuſe ād violating of mariage / ād cōmitting fornicatiō / withe ſouche like vices as it is to be ſene by Dina / Gen. 34. by Thamar 2. Reg. 13. by the priſtes wief abuſyd of the Reniamites Iudicū. 9.20. rede the place. for the rapt of Helena Troie periſhid. for the oppreſſing of Lucrece at Rome and other. Then as there be lawes to preſerue the perſones thelfe of the cōmune wealthe ſo muſt there be lawes to preſerue ſouche goddes as appertayne vnto the mē
                  bres of the cōmune wealthe. that one do no wrō

How be it / ſeyng we ar fraile and ſo ile that many tymes / we tranſgteſſe / ſomme / or all theſe lawes that preſeruithe the cōmune wealthe it is neceſſary to fynd ād prepare ſome remedie to haue the tranſgreſſour puniſhid ād the perſō that is hurt ād offendid reſtorid vnto his right. therfore is there this clauſe ād rule ī the law. Thow ſhalt yeue no falſe teſtimony againſt thy neighboure: whiche is the Ninthe cōmaundemēt. ād bidithe as well the ſuperiour powres to ſe equyte ād iuſtice withe out reſpect of perſones as the cauſe requirithe obſeruyd / as ſouche ſhall be teſtimonies in a dutfull mater to ſay as they know trewlie.

Therfore for byddythe he all iniuries / violence / forſe / and othere vncheritable meanes where withe all we might hurt our neighbours bodye. And likewyce requirythe that in caſe we can do ony thyng for the healpe of oure Neighbour / we diligently applye oure ſeruice in his vſee and to procure the thynges that appertayne vnto his tranquilite / to ſaue him from aduerſites / and to yeue him oure helpyng hand when his trobles ſhall requyre Seyng there his nothing more dere to man / then his bodie / and liefe /

               Souche as procure and ſarche the deathe of man priuelie the lawe puniſhithe more cruelli.

I Englyſhid this the ſecond verſe before: it ſhuld not be difficile to remoue this ile: if euery man that ſhall ſe the peace broken in a cite / had auctorite to ſondre the perſonnes / and bynd the peace breakers to apeace / by there wordes / and he that brake his faythe / ād promes to him that requiryd it / to loſe his hed in the name of apayne. as it is vſyd in ſome commune wealthes.

They care not whether the cauſe be wrōg or right. They ſhuld nether receaue / by the lawe of God nether ony chriſtianeman yeue them ony thyng except the cauſe be godd. if it be: euery man is bund to defend it. If not: noman. This cannot be knowen of all men: but if the cauſe be nowght / God excuſythe noman / but eſtimithe hym a murderer of his awne liefe / and the Magiſtrat that hyrithe him thoccation therof.
               This precept is not vnder ſtond onlye of externall murder / but forbiddythe alſo the murder of the hart. which thowghe it deſerue no puniſhmēt in the worold / yet God accomptythe is worthy of deathe / as it is to be ſene / Gen. 4. where as God accuſyd Cain for the murder of his

                   of God accuſtomithe to cum for ſouche ſynnes. Like wice we ſe by the puniſhment of fornication / and oppreſſion of virgines whiche is not inferiour to adulterie. The citie of Sichem / and the inhabitantes therof were deſtroyd / for the oppreſſing of Dina Iacobs dawghter Geneſ. 34. Iudas commaundid Thamar the wydowe to be put to deathe / for diſhonoring of widowed Gene. 38. Pinehas kyllyd Simri the Iſrealite / withe his hore Caſbi the Midianite / Nume. 25. ſo that all kynd of adulterie is for bidden / and nothing in this caſe to be admittid / but the lawfull coniunction betwene man and woman. But this is not all that this precept for biddithe. for as it for biddithe the act it ſelfe ſo doothe it adulterie of the hart / and of the Iye like wice the adulterie of the mouthe / as vnchaſt and filthi communication. The adulterie of the handes that prouokythe or mouythe the perſon that is not his. Solomon ſaythe he ſhall borne his cote / that barythe fyer in his beſomme: and burne his fette that walkythe vpon the coles. Here is for bydden likewice the adulterie of apparell / and ſo conſequentlie all exceſſe of mete and drinke / and other occaſions / that ar inductions to this ile / and commith of the concupiſcens of the hart / for bydden in the ſcripture. Peter ſaithe / 1. Pet. 3. The habit / and apparell

of a woman ſhall not be in brodyd and ſplayde here nether in laing on of god / or coſtley aray. ye ſe in oure tyme / that many bare more vpon there backes then they be worthe. A woman pamperid vpp with precious ſtones and gold: knottyd be hind and afore with more periles / then here houſbond and ſhe beſtowithe in almes all dayes of there lieffe. An other ſort / that lackythe where withe all to beſtowe theſe charges: ar a dilling / and burling of there here a longer tyme / then a godlye woman that redithe the ſcrypture to folow it: is in appareling of thre or fowre yong infantes. If this were onlie in the women / it were the leſſe harme: but it is alſo in men for there is not aſmouche as he that hathe but 40. Schillinges by the yere but is as long in the mornīg / to ſet his berd in an order / as a godlie crawſtis man would be / in loming of a peace of karſey.
               And not only they / but alſo ſouche as ſhuld yeue there ſeruantes an example of ſobriete: as well in the Clerge / as among the Ciuile gouerners of the erthe. I ſpeake not againſt a decent and ſemely apparell of man nor / woman: euery perſon in his degre. But that eche of them ſhuld auoyde the exceſſe and ile therof that is for bidden in Godes lawes: and rather ſtudie to commend him ſelfe by vertews / then to be eſtimyd by his apparell. thus doothe not God / but

but alſo Ethnykes teache / as Cicero. 1. offic. Adhibenda eſt mundicia: non odioſa, nec exquiſita nimis, tantum quae fugiat agreſtem. & inhumanam negligentiā. That is to ſay / ſouche amens ſhuld be kept in apparell / that ſhuld be nor to net / nor to fylthy / but ſouche as might auoyde a rude / and beſtlie negligence. In the 5. Matth. and Luc. 6. we ſe how Chriſt interpretithe this precept: not onlye to a voyde the ile it ſelfe / but alſo thoccaſions of it / ſayng if thynne Iye / or yight hand offend the / caſt them of. Where as Chriſt ſhewythe there is no occaſion that can excuſe adulterie or fornication. As this ſinne hathe degreis in it ſelfe as ye ſe / and may perceaue by the paynes reherſid: ſo is it more offence in one perſon then in the other. more in ayge then in uthe: more in the Magiſtrat / or Prince / then in a priuate perſon / more in the teacher of Godes word / then in the herer.
               And as the condicion of the perſones agrauat the offence / ſo ſhuld iuſtice agrauat the punyſhment therof. and not to punyſhe the one / and lett the other go. There is noman more preuilegyd then the other. As iuſtice is executyd agaynſt the inferiour / ſo ſhuld it be agaynſt the ſuperiour. For as the one is ſubiect vnto the law / of God ſo is the other. There is an other kynd of adulterie for bydden in this precept

whiche Chriſt ſpeakythe of Matthei. 5. and 19. capit. whiche is vnlawfull diuorſemement of matrimonie where as the man puttythe awaye the woman or the woman / the man for vnlawfull cauſes.
               The ſame auctorite hathe the woman to put away the man / that the man hathe to put away the woman / Marc. 10. Chriſt ſaythe there is no lawfull cauſe to diſſolue matrimonie / but adulterie. For when the woman yeuithe the vſe of her bodie to an other man / ſhe is no more here fyrſt houſboundes wiefe. Nor the houſbound no no lenger the houſbound of his wief / then he obſerue the faithe of matrimonie withe her: where ſo euer this fault happen / and canne be prouyd by certayne ſignes / and lawfull teſtimonies: the perſones may by the auctorite of Godes word and miniſterie of the Magiſtrates be ſeparatyd ſo one from the other / that it ſhalbe Lawfull for the man to marie an other wief / and the wief to marie an other houſbound / as Chriſt ſaithe Matt. 5. and 19. ſo that the man ſhall not nede to kepe at homme wi
                     •
                  he him a woman / that is nomore his then an other mannes.
               Nether the woman ſouche a houſbound as is nomore hers / thē an other womānes: Mar. 10. S. Pau. 
                     •
                  . Co. 7. ſhewithe and other cauſe of

deuorſment / when the one of the perſonnes beyng marid is an infidele / and of a contrarie faithe. If this perſon will not dwell with the other that is his felow in matrimonie / ād a Chriſtiane. it is lawfull to breke the faithe of Matrimonie / and marie with an other. So ſaithe S. Ambroſ. wrytyng in the ſame place / of S. Paule: Non debetur reuerentia coniugij ei, qui horret autorem coniugij. That is to ſay / the reuerencie of matrimonie is not dew vnto him / that contemnithe the autour of matrimonie. And in the ſame place / Contumelia enim creatoris ſoluit ius matrimonij, circa eum qui relinquitur, ne accuſetur alij copulatus. That is to ſay / the contempt of God breakithe the right of matrimonie cōſerning him that is for ſaken / leſt he ſhuld be accuſyd beyng marid to an other.
               Thow ſeiſt that the lord Matt. 5.19. yeuithe licence for adulterie / to deuorſe / ād marie againe And Paule for infidelite. The diuorſe that the Biſhopes permitt in there lawis / is no diuorſe but onlie the name of it. For they wyll not permitt thoſe perſones / thus deuorſid to marie againe. They ſay / what God hathe coniugnid / man ſhuld not ſeparate. Who denyythe that? God ſpeakythe of the woman that ſtandithe by the law / and ordinaunce of God / beyng lawfully maryd / an dothe office of awyffe. If adulterie / or the caſe of infidelite chaunce / man diſſolnythe

not the Matrimonie / but the perſon ſelfe that offendithe. and the Magiſtrat is but a teſtimonie of his / or her ile fact / that hathe broken / and diſſoluyd that / that God coplyd. And proteſtythe to the worold / that they thus diſſoluyd / may marye agayne / not withſtondyng the former mariayge. Thowgh mannis lawes admit it not / Godes lawes doothe. whois wordes / may not be wreſtyd out of tune / but all waies applied to the end / they were ſpoken. The phariſees Mat. 19. cap. demaundyd of Chriſt / whether it were lawfull for a man / to deuorſe his wiefe / for euery cauſe / and to marie a nother: as all thoſe dyd in the tyme of Moſen Deut. 24. Chriſt anſwerd directlye to the queſtion / and ſayd / it was not lawfull for aman to put away his wiefe / and marie and other / Except ſhe committyd adulterie. Then / and for that cauſe / it is Lawfull now in the tyme of the goſpell / as it was in the tyme of Moſes lawe. But for the frawardnys of condicions / or tediouſnis of maners / men ſhuld not ſeparat there wiefes / nether from bed nether from bord. Mouche leſſe marie an other. He or ſhe / that cannot withe wyſdomme amend the diſpleaſaunt / and cro

                  yd maners of his / or her mate: muſt patientlie bare them. Remembring / if Chriſt commaund vs to be of ſouche a tollerancye / and patience to indure the obloquie / and iniuries of all men

thowghe they be oure ennymies: how mouche more the moroſite / and iniures of a domeſticall companion? A hard croſſe / but patience muſt ligthen it / till God ſend a redreſſe. Chriſt yet ſpeakythe of an other adultery Mat. 19. whiche thoſe commit / that marie at one tyme / too wiefes / and ſay / if a man haue an hundrythe (as he may haue / as well as too) yet all be but too / and one fleſhe in the lord. Chryſt doothe not ſo interpretat too / Matth. 19. cap. but referrythe too / to one man / and one woman / as the text that he alegythe out of Gene. cap. 1.2. declarithe / ſayng. haue ye not reden that he / that made from the beginnyng: made them male / and female. Therfore ſhall man leue father and mother / and officiat his wieffe / and ſhalbe too / in one fleſhe. this text admittythe no pluralites of wiefes / but deſtroythe playne the ſentence of thoſe that defend the coniunction of manie wiefes with one mā. for as at the begyming of Matrimonie was but one man and one woman / creatyd / and maryed to gather: nomore ſhuld there be now in one matrimonie as Chriſt there teachite / and expoundith too in one fleche / and not thre or fore in one fleſhe. the word of god muſt be folowid / and not thexamples of the fathers in this caſe. It is alſo for hydden by mannes lawes / Codic. lib. 5. Tit. 5. de inceſtis & inutilibus nuptijs. Neminem, qui ſub ditione ſit Romani nominis, bi

of the churche / wherevnto they were callyd. oure Biſhopes hathe ſo mouche witt they can rule and ſerue as they ſay in boothe ſtates. Of the churche / and alſo in the Ciuile policie.

               This is thyffte of ſouche goddes as appartayne vnto the bodie.
               There is an other kynd of the ſoule / as when the miniſters yeue not vnto ſouche as be committyd vnto there charge the word of God / ſimple / and plainlye in atong knowen / and lede not the people to wardes the lyffe euerlaſtyng as the word of god teathythe. to know that for chriſtes ſake onlie with out all reſpect of workes / ſynne

They take from the ſacramentes to mouche / that ſay thei be but externall ſignes to know the churche of chriſt by / from ſouche as be not of the churche. As the Romaine ons was knowen frō an other citicene by his gowne. or thoſe that ſay they may be donne and leffte vndon as it pleacythe man / that vſyth them. They add to mouche to the ſacramentes that attribute aſmouche vnto them / as vnto the grace and promis that they confyrme. As to the Sacrament of Baptiſme remiſſion of ſynne / when it is but an externall confirmation of it Rom. 4. and vnto the holie ſupper of the lord they attribute a diſtribution delyueraunce or exhibition of Chriſtes naturall bodie / where as it is but a confirmatiō of the grace / and mercy that he bowght for vs vpō the croſſe / with ſheddīg his pretiōs blud / ād deathe of his innocēt bodie / as the wordes ſhewithe plainlie Luc. 22. 1.

And cōſider the grace / that he optainid for vs in his bodie ād blud / ād be thākfull for the ſame. Great petie it is / that the deuill hathe ſo preuailid in many mē / that obſtinatlie without reaſon / and auctorie of the ſcripture / preache there phantaſies vnto the people of God / and would perſwade that there ymagination / or dreme of chriſtes holie bodie / were a trew / and ſubſtāciall bodie. but ſouche is the deuill is malice. now that many mē ar perſwadid that the ſubſtaūce of bred remainithe / ād can no lēger deceaue thē in ſenſible thinges: he carithe them to as great an ile / or wors thē that / and would mak them be lyue that a phantaſie / or dreme of a bodie / that hathe nether quantite / nor qualite to be a trew body. my good reader without all affection conſider the reaſons / and auctorite of godes word / that I ſhall reherſe hyre bryuely againſt thoſe thiues that robb the humanite of chriſt of all humane qualites and quantites. Ffyrſt they iudge the bodie of chriſt / that is in heauen to haue all properties / and condicions of a trew mā. and of the ſame ſelfe body in the ſacrament / they take a way all the condicions / and qualites of a trew mannis bodie.

They ſay thow muſt not iudge ſo carnally and groſſely of chriſtis bodie. belyue thow the ſcripture / and byd them ſhew the / the place in the ſcripture that thow ſhuldeſt not iudge ſo of a trew phiſicall / and mathematicall bodie which chriſt now hathe / as the fyngers of S.

Io. 1. and alſo his aſcenſion barythe record / Act. 1. let them proue / that they ſpeake / by the ſcripture and ſhew where chriſt was euer preſent in one place viſible / and in an other place preſent at the ſame tyme / inuiſible.
               They ſay / we muſt ſpeake as the ſcripture ſpeakithe / that ſaythe by the brede Mat. 26. Marc. 14. Luc. 22. this is my body: and of theſe few wordes ile vnder ſtond they dreame wounderfull

miſteries / that the ſubſtanciall body of chriſtes humanite is preſent / by miracle / and away celeſtiall / paſſing all mēnis capacites. withe many other for fet imaginations and new foūd termes / which the ſcripture neuer knew of. how be it / if thow marke there concluſion thow ſhalt find nothīg but the name of a body whiche they haue yeuē to this chimere / ad monſtre that there phanthaſie hathe conceuid. They ſpeake of the letter: and none goithe farther from it then they. Chriſt ſaide: This is my bodye that is betrayed for yō. the whiche was a viſible ād ſenſible bodie as the Iyes of thoſe that ſawe him hange vpon the croſſe / teſtifie. They ſay it is an īuiſible bodie that ocopyythe no place: but the ſcripture ſaythe the the contrarie as thow ſeiſt By the wordes of the ſupper / Luc. 22.
               Hold them therfore by the ſcripture faſt / and when they name the moſt holie humanite of Chriſt / and would haue it with the bred. bid thē ſhew the / the bodie. for the text ſaythe that he ſhall cum as viſible vnto vs as he departyd frō vs / Act. 1. if they ſay / that place ſpeakithe / of his cōming to iudgment and not of his preſence in the Sacrament denye there ſayng. For the text ſaythe that he ſhall be in heuen till that tyme of iudgment / Act. 3.
               It is ile donne of ony man to ſpeake as the ſcripture ſpeakythe / and not to take the

meaning of the Scripture. God of his mercye yeue men grace to know the trewthe. Before Chriſt in his ſupper callyd the bred his bodie: ſe how he fore ſawe this after ile / and phantaſticall dreames / that mē would take his wordes / contrary onto his mind. In the 6. of Ioan. he tellithe his diſciples / that to eate his body / was to belyue in him. That avaylid not / but ſtreight way ſaied / the wordes that I ſpeke be ſprit and liefe: and callyd them from the letter. Yet agayne the thyrd tyme in the ſame place ſaythe / what if ye ſe the ſonne of man aſcēd where as he was fyrſt. By theſe reaſones he toke away all bodely eating / and rigure of the letter. like wyce after the ſupper / leſt they ſhuld dreme yet of abodely preſence / Becauſe Sacramentally he callyd the bred his body he repetid agayne the ſame wordes / Ioan. 16. It is expedient that I depart. Againe / I go to my father. I came from my father into the worold. I for ſake the worold againe / and go to my father. Why ſhuld not theſe places hold there autorite / and teache vs to vnderſtād theſe wordes / this is my body. ſeyng that boothe before / and after the ſupper / chryſt told them be playne wordes / he would not be in the worold. and ſo dothe inſtitution of it declare / That this Sacrament was / and ſhuld be a memory of his bleſſyd paſſion / and paynes ſuffryd

in the fleſhe: and not a diſtribution of the fleſhe it ſelfe / Luce. 22.1. Corinth. 11. None of them that put this corporall preſence in the bred yet hether vnto / neuer could interpretat the wordes of the ſupper aright. I would be glad to hyre it ons if they will not admit the alteration of the bred with the Papiſtes / they will / ād can do no nether wice / but interpretat the wordes thus. This is my body. That is to ſay / very bred / and my body / and referr the verb (is) to too diuerſe ſubſtaunces. to the bodye of Chriſt / and to the bred / whiche is plaine againſt the nature of a verbe ſubſtantiue / to be atron

Seing Sainct Paule doothe interpretat / and expund this word (is) in the Sacrament of circumciſion (and all Sacramentes be of one nature) by this word ſignifythe / or confirmithe / Roma. 4. what ſhuld men meane thus to troble and vex the churche of Chriſt with new doctrine. Alſo it is a commune maner of the Scripture / to attribute vnto the ſigne / the thing ment by the ſigne. God knowithe / what a weake reaſon this is to ſay people muſt ſpeake as the Scripture doothe / ād would proue there by / a reall / and bodely preſence of oure ſauiour that died for vs / and aſcendyd into heauen. Syttythe at the right hand of god all myghtie. And from thens ſhall

com to iudge the quyck / and the ded. did not Arrius defend his hereſie with as good an argument as this / when he ſpake as the ſcripture do the / and ſayd: Pater maior me eſt. My father is greather then I. Or might not aman proue by the ſame reaſon / that Elie / Eſaie / and all other Prophetes / before Chriſt came / to be deſeauers of the people / ād falſe preachers. For Chriſt ſaid / Io. 10. as mā

But toke not the meaning withe the word / as we muſt do except we intend to robb the holye ſcripture of here trew ſenſe and vngodlie forſe the letter / from the trew meanyng therof: as thoſe do / that rather conſtrayne the vnlernyd conſcience with fere: then perſuade them / with godd Argumentes out of the Scripture.
               They intricat the wyttis of men with ſophiſtre and illuſion that the know not what they hyre / nether they them ſelfes what they ſay whē the oration is endid. for a trew bodye / they ſhewe a blancke ſhadowe / or rather phantaſie of a bodie and all there wordes hathe browght forthe nothing leſſe then a bodie that they promeſſid to deliuer vnto him that they would perſwade. As thoſe that Horace ſpekythe of:

                     Parturient montes, naſcetur ridiculus mus.
They ſay he that beliuithe not there wordes that they haue atrew body withe: Hoc eſt corpus meum. Was neuer well perſwadid of the fyrſt article of his faithe / ſcilicet, I muſt beliue that God is omnipotent. ſo we do. But withe this reaſon they ſubuert them ſelfes. Becauſe ye ſe in the Sacrament God doothe not make the thing they ſpeke / and therfore it is not there / for if he would it ſhuld be: it muſt be a mānes bodie withe all the qualites therof / for Chriſt hathe none other body / but that he toke of the holie virgine / and is allwaies viſible and ſubiect vnto the ſenſes whereſo euer it be / Ioan. 21.1. Ioan. 1.
               When they troble the withe the wordes of the ſupper (this is my bodie) returne vnto all the ſacramentes of the old Teſtament / Gene. 17. Exo. 12. and thow ſhalt fynd that they were the conconfirmations of the thinges they were callid and not the thing it ſelfe / Roman. 4. Then loke vpon other places of the Scripture / Ioan. 6.16.

Woult thow not beliue all theſe places / as well as the dreame of them that Cholythe the withe one place / of the Scripture ile vndreſtand.

Let thoſe vntractable men iudge / what they liſt of the Sacrament and holye ſupper of the lord. Beliue thow withe the Scripture that it is but a memorie of Chriſt deathe: a confirmation and miſtery of oure redemption / Luce. 22. 1. Corinth. 11. Luc. ſaythe / do it in the memorie of me / and leſt ony man ſhuld ſay that memory is to receaue the corporall bodie of Chriſt Sainct Paul. 1.

               ASmouche as is neceſſarie for man to lyue an vpp right and godlie lyffe in this worold boothe to wardes god and man is repetyd in the Nynne commaundementes afore if they be obſeruyd accordin to there inſtitution / and mid of allmightie the yeuer of the ſame. As he deſyrithe all thexternall actes of man to extend vnto the glorie of god / and utilite of oure neighbour: ſo doothe he in this laſt precept require / that the mynd and ſolle of man be replenyſhid withe all affections and diſyre of loue and cherite / That what ſo euer we do / it be donne with out vayne glorye / and hypocryſye from

the hart / not ſhewyng one thyng vttwardlie / and haue an other ſecreatlie in the hart. and this commaundement is referryd to all the other as Chryſt ſaythe Matth. 5. Thowghe the wordes of the commaundement make mencyon onlye of the concupiſcens of ſouche thynges as be oure neyghbours poſſeſſion. As his houſe / his wiefe with other ſouche Godes as be his. and in this precept is declaryd ſpetially oure infirmite / and weakenis that we ar all miſerable ſynners Roman. 7. for neuer was there / or euer ſhalbe / onlye Chryſt exceptyd but offendyd in this precept / to what perfection or degre of holinys ſo euer he came vnto. No creature born into the worold could ſatisfie this lawe / and all holie ſayncts had ſynne remaynyng in them as long they lyuyd Pſal. 14.2.1. Ioan. 1. Rpm. 7. 1. Cor. 4. Pſal. 129.16.31. Iob. 9. Exod. 34. of the whiche places we may lern to call for the great / and ineſtimable helpe of God that we may be quit / and ſauyd from this imperfection / in Chriſt Ieſu / and accomptyd in him the childre of God and ſatisfiers of the law Roman. 8. for by this law is requyryd ſouche a cherite / and ſyncere loue towardes God / and man: that the mynd ſhuld not haue aſmouche as ony contrary motion / or ony reſiſtaunce at all / to ſtayne the glorie / and bewtye of this loue. Whiche comprehendyth

all thoſe commaundementes a fore reherſyd as Chriſt ſaythe Matth. 22. Marc. 12. and like wyce Matth. 7. all thynges that ye would men ſhuld do to youe / the ſame do ye to them. This is the lawe / and the prophetes. So that by theſe wordes ye may know what is the ſcope and end of the law. trewlye none other thyng then to bryng men to iuſtyce and honeſtie of liffe / and to make him lik vnto the law / and ſo vnto allmightie God / who is ymayge the law expreſſythe. and the more man conformythe him ſelfe to lyue after the lawe / the more reſemblythe the almighty God yeuer of the law. Moſes when he would bruely call vnto remembraunce the ſomme of Godes lawes ſaythe / Et nunc Iſrael quid petit abs te Dominus Deus tuus, niſi ut timeas Dominum, & ambules in uijs eius: diligas eum, ac ſeruias ei in toto corde, & tota anima, cuſtodias
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      mandata eius, Deut. 20. That is to ſay / Therfore now Iſrael what dothe the lord / thy God aſke of the / ſauyng that thow ſhuldeſt fere the lord / and walke in his cō
                  maundementes / loue hym / and ſerue him / withe all thy hart / and lieffe / and to kepe his commaundementes. and repetythe the ſame wordes agayne. 22. cap. the law would that our hartes ſhuld be replenyſhid withe the loue of God. of the whiche loue proſedithe the loue to wardes our neyghbour as Paule writithe 1. Tim. 1.

The occaſion of all hatred that we bare vnto God / his holie word / and oure neighboure / is the loue of oureſelfes / and the vanite of this worold. In this Commaundement is not only forbyd theffect of ile / but alſo thaffect and deſyre towardes ile. Not onlie thaffect / luſt / concupiſcens / prones / inclination / deſyre and appetite towardes ile: but alſo when man is mooſt deſtitute of ſynne / and mooſtfull of vertew: mooſt ferriſt from

He that conſiderithe this precept well / ſhall the better perceaue the greatnys of goddes infinite mercy: and vndreſtand the article and doctrine of fre iuſtification by faythe. For all thowghe grace preuent the doyng of godd / and folowit neuer ſo mouche / yet is the worke vnperfet / and ſatisfyythe not the perfection of the law. onlie it is Chriſtes merites that we be ſauyd by. the whiche article the deuill mooſt enuyythe / and goithe about to oppreſſe as mouche as is poſſible.

is not only the fre giffte of God to preuent the in doing well / and to folow the in the ſame / but alſo fre imputation of lieffe eternall whiche thow canſt not merit nether withe grace / nether without grace. For as I ſayde before to what perfection ſo euer thow be com vnto: this law accuſithe the. Thow ſhalt no couyt. But be cauſe thow trowiſt / and beliue in Chriſt Ieſu thow ſhalt be ſauyd / Ioan. 3.4.5.6. and wher as the law promiſythe nothing but vpon ſouche condicion as we performe it to the vttermuſt / Chriſt Ieſu take the frō here / the rigure and extremite of here iuſtice in vs / and laythe it vpon himſelfe. So that the blyſſe eternall that the lawe promiſythe for workes: God yeuythe vnto vs by grace / for his ſake that onlie ſatiſfyed the law Chriſt Ieſus / Roman. 5 Epheſ. 1. Colloſſ. 1. Galat. 4. And in this Argument of fre iuſtification wrytythe / Saynct Paule in the leuen fyrſt chapiters in the Epiſto. to the Ro. where as in the 4. he puttythe Abraham for an example that is the father of all belyuers. in whom we may ſee how the frendes of God ar iuſtifyed / or optayne the fauour of God. And ſaythe that Abraham was iuſtied by faythe / Geneſ. 15. and before circumſition. Whereas thow ſeyſt / too thynges.
               One that the vncircumcyſyd was iuſtifyed▪
                  
the other that noman was iuſtified By the merites / or bentfites of the Sacrament. Like wyce he was promiſyd to be the here of the worold becauſe of him ſhuld be born Chriſt Ieſu the lord of the worold / Id credidit, non per Legem meruit.
               
               This he beliuyd / and not by the lawe merytyd / Galat. 3. an other reaſon Paule alegythe that Abraham / and all other ar iuſtified by faythe.
               It is not poſſible that the promes of God ſhuld be irritatyd or made vayne: but if it dependyth of the iuſtice of the law / it could not be certain. therfore addithe he / frely by faythe. whyche faithe in optaining remiſſion of ſynne beholdithe only the mercy of God in Chriſt Ieſu / and lokithe apon none other merites. Yet marke more: he ſaithe that grace is the heritayge of the belyuer / by the iuſtice of faythe / Roman. 4. Then it is no merit. Haeredes naſcimur, non emimus. We ar born heres / and bye it not as thoſe ſay that attribute remiſſion of ſynne to workes or Sacramentes whiche doothe teſtifye or confyrme / the frendes of God / and not make them Godes frendes / Roman. 4.
               Thus thow ſeiſt what the law is / how thow or bound ſtudiouſlie to obey it / and how it is fulfyllyd in Chriſt Ieſu / who is iuſtyce is thyne / If thow belyue in hym / as thowghe

thow haddeſt perfetlie ſatisfied the Law thy ſelfe.

               Caput XIIII. 1. Of tyme / and place.
               AS it is the maner of all Orators not onlie to ſtabliſhe the mater they intreat of / withe ſouche reaſones / Argumentes / and probations as beſt may confyrme / and ſtabliſhe there purpoſe / but alſo ad ſouche reaſones / as may inclinthe herers to fauour the thing ſpoken: and like wyce leauein there mindes ſouche perſwations / as might in maner prycke them forthe / and beforſe conſtrayne them to put in effect and practyſe the thyng ſpoken of / and then to remoue ſouche impedimentes / and breake the forſe of ſouche contrarie Argumentes / as may be obiectyd to let the thyng / the would optayneand proue. So doothe Moſes in the booke of Deuteronom. as thow hardiſt

before / leaue no Argument nor reaſon vnſpoken of / that might excitat / ſtore vpp / prouoke and forſe vs to the loue / obedience / and execution of Godes Lawes / as the 28. chapit. of Deuterono. ſhewithe. In the 29. and 30. he remouythe all the obiections / impedimentes / and lettys that with oldythe vs from the obediē
                  ce / and doyng of Godes Lawes.
               The fyrſt Sophiſme or carnall obiection is when men ſay it is no place / nor tyme now to lerne / or obey the word of God / we be not in amonaſterie / in the ſcole / or in the temple: we be in the brode worold / and muſt do as other men do and rather ſerue the place we be in / & ululare cum Lupis. Barke withe the Wulfe / then ſpeake of the Scripture. ſo dothe they reaſon of tyme likewyce. now it is to dangerous a ſeaſon to reaſon ony maters / let it paſſe till he worold be more quyet / and ſouche like. As the Iſraelites might haue ſayd to Moſes that cōmaundid to obſerue this law when they came into the lād of Canaan.
               We obſeruid not theſe preceptes in the wildernys / wherfore then more in Canaan. we kept them not for the ſpace of 40. yers / nomore will we here affter. This obiection he breakythe / and prouithe that the law ſhuld be allwaies obſeruid / and in euery place: and ſhewithe how the obſeruation of the law was rewardyd / and the

neglectyng of it puniſhyd. And declarithe the ſame by examples. God fed his frendes in the deſert by miracle from heauen / and preſeruyd all there apparell that it conſumyd not / nor peeyſhyd in the waring / for the ſpace of 40. yers. Then of Pharao and the too great Kynges of Heſbon / and Baſan. Sehon / and Og.
            
            
               Caput XV. 2. Exception of perſones.
               THe ſecond obiection is / when men put from them ſelfes the obedience of the law vnto other. Saing. let the Pryſtes / and Monckes kepe the law and lērne it. what ſhuld a Prynce / Magiſtrat / or Gentle man be bound to lerne and kepe all thoſe holie rules. farther / vthe cannot be tyed to ſo ſtreight canonnes it muſt not ſo be brydelyd.
               Souche as be parkyd in / with highe wales and ſeparatyd from the worold muſt obſerue theſe Commaundementes of God. This wyckyd acceptation of perſones. Moſes deſtroythe / and moſt Godlye repetythe and numbrythe the membres of the churche / the orders / 

and decrees of the ſame. Repetythe the wordes of the aliaunce. Sayng: Vos omnes hodie ſtatis coram domino Deo ueſtro. Principes ueſtri, tribus ueſtre, Seniores ueſtri, Praefecti ueſtri at

That is to ſay / All ye this day ſtand before the lord youre God / youre Prynces / youre trybes / youre Elders / youre Officers / and all men of Iſrael. Youre Chyldren / youre Wieues / and thy Geſt. and ſo forthe / Rede the place. And why they ſtode before the lord / the text dyclarythe. To entre aliaunce withe him. No maner of perſon is excludyd from the lege. Wherby we know as Godes mercy is commune for all men / whiche is the fyrſt part of the condicion expreſſyd in the lege ſo a like is the obedience towardes the law requiryd of all men: ſpecially of ſouche as be the gouerners of the people in the miniſterie of the churche / or elſe in the gouernaunce of the commune wealthe. If the Preacher be ignorant of Godes worde / and of a diſſolute liefe what Godlinies or vertew can there be in his herers. If the Kyng / Prince / Magiſtrat / or Rulers of the commune wealthe / nor know godes lawes / nor folow iuſtice / equite / temperancye / nor ſobriete / What honeſtye or vertew can they loke to haue in there ſubiectes. They muſt gyue

example of all vertew. Let them beware betyme that vſe theſe obiections / for if they thick to haue God for there God / let them obſerue his aliaunce. For he will puniſhe the tranſgreſſoure withe our reſpect of perſones who ſo euer it be.
            
            
               Caput XVI. 3. Preſumption.
               THe thyrd obiection / or Satanicall ſophiſme is preſumption or ſecurite of Godes will / when men knowithe what is to be donne yet againſt his knolege preſuming of Godes mercie dothe the thing that is ile. This horrible ſinne extendithe wounders far. Thone ſittithe in iudgment and falſlie iudgithe. The other clymmithe to honor / and ryches by flattery / vſury / ſimonye / extorſion / fraude / and pylling of the poure. The other holdythe in the truithe to beſpoken / and lettythe out the lies that ſhuld be kept ī: with all ſouche other like vices / as raigne now aday in the worold. They hyre by the wordes of God / that thoſe iles and abhominations be curſid of God / yet hope they the contrary and think yet to haue Godes fauour / as the text ſaythe▪ Deut. 29. rede and marke it: Cum audierie uerba iuramenti huius, benedicat ſibi in corde

ſuo dicens: pax erit mihi, etiā ſi inceſſero in imaginatione cordis mei, ut addat ebriam ſitienti. That is to ſay / when he hyrythe the wordes of this othe (where God ſwerithe to puniſhe the ile Deut. 28.) he promiſythe godd to him ſelfe / ſayng in his hart / yea if I walke in the ymagination of my hart / and take my pleaſure there is no danger. This diabolicall preſumptiō is thoccation that men not only fall into dyuerſe kyndes of abhomination / but all ſo perſeuer in the ſame ile. let euery man iudge his awne conſciēs and ſe. Agaynſt the word of God he takythe hope / as it ſemythe him of Godes mercy / whiche is no hope at all / but the very withe / and halter of the deuill to ſtrangle at length him / that is this perſwadid in this ile / and dangerous opinion. They thinke it is faythe / where as it is very arrogancy / a trew knolege of God / when it is but adeuyllyſh illuſion / and falſe opynion of man as it aperythe in the ſame place by Moſes wordes Non agnoſcit Dominus ut propitietur ei, ſed fumabit tunc furor Domini, & zelus eius in uirū iſtum, & cubabit ſuper eum omnis maledictio, quae ſcripta eſt in libro iſto, delebit
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      Dominus nomen eius ſub coelo, Deut. 29, that is to ſay / the lord will not fauour him / but then be angre / and kendle his Ire againſt this man / ſo that euery malediction wroten in this booke ſhall reſt vpon him / and the lord ſhall deſtroy his name

vnder heauen. Rede the place / and lern to a vayde ſouche ſecurite and ſiniſter iudgment of god and his nature. The originall / and fontaine frō whēs this preſumptiō ſpringithe is ignorācie / and a truſt in other men̄es vertewes for whois merites the thinke to be ſauid. Sōme ſay they haue Angellis / and Archāgellis / and many other holie ſaynctes in heauē that cōmend there ſaluation to God. An other truſtythe to ſouche workes as may be donne apon the erthe for hym / and he do nothing hym ſelfe but liue as he liſt in a vayne hope / to haue ſolace in iniquite. This great offence is noryſhyd diuerſe Wayes. fyrſt when men iudge not aright of Godes nature that he is as angre with ſynne as the ſcripture ſaythe. The ſecond when men iudge amiſſe of Godes workes. When they ſe / he puniſhyd one for ſynne / he thynkythe not that the ſame punyſment apertaynythe vnto hym. Moſes teachyth / and ſettythe before the people the workes of God / his wounders and meruelles donne in Aegypt / in the cites of Sedom / and Aemora / Adma and Zeboijm the whiche the lord ſubuertyd in his Ire / and furie and ſayd theſe workes only punyſhyd not thoſe that offendyd / but alſo ſhuld teache all other men to avoyde Godes diſpleaſure: for to that end miracles of punyſmentes be don / as Chryſt ſaythe Luc. 13. to fore warne men of the ile to com.

and thus hathe he all wayes callyd men to penaunce. If they would ſtill be nawght / a lenghe he punyſhyd cruellye / as not only the holie Hiſtories of the Bible teſtifie where as ye ſe kynges / and kyngdomes / changyd and deſtroyd / but alſo in prophane wryters ye ſhall ſe / by what miracles God callyd the Magiſtrates / and people of the commune wealthe to repentaunce. Titus Liuius libro tertio de ſecundo bello Punico writyt he that an ox caluyd a horſe. in the 7. booke a Pigg varryd withe a mannis mouthe. and a child borne withe an Elephantes hed. Valerius wrytythe lib. 1. ca. 4. that a Mare folyd a Hare in the kynge of the Perſians campe callyd Xerxes. Who as ſomme wryters record / browght againſt the Atheniens 1700000. men of warr. Whom Themiſtocles the Capitane of the Grekes ouer came in the See. Herod. wrytythe this Hiſtorie at large. Had kyng Xerxes conſideryd the worke of god he might haue lernyd that there was a god that would torn the forſe / and corayge of his horſmen / into the fere ād timidite of the timerous / and ferefull hare. Liuius lib. 3. de vrbis origine writithe how the heauēs burnyd / and deuidid it ſelfe in too li. 2. de 2. bello Punico. the ſee bākes burnid. The ſonne was ſeene to fyght with the Mone. and like wice too Mones to be ſeē in the day. lib. 3. he ſaythe that the See burnyd. Theſe

ſupernaturall workes might haue tawght the people of thoſe dayes amendement of lief had they not byn blynd as we be that neuer take profet by ony worke of God / other wyce thē to eat the reuēwes of the earthe as the brute beſtes of the ſame. nor no more knolege of god by the motions of the heauens then the ox / or horſe / that like wyce ſee them / and yet nether the wyſer nether the better. if we markyd the 8. and 19. Pſalm. we ſhuld know they were made to an other end. The gentiles ſhame vs / all a waie thar lernid by the reuolution of the yere that nothyng was durable in this mortall lyffe Horat. Carmi. lib. 4.

               Quae rapit hora diem.
               The thyrd reaſon is that men iudge amiſſe of Godes promiſis that ſaythe he will punyſhe doutles for ſynne all maner of people / be they neuer ſo ſtrong as the prophetis all waies teſtifie / Hier. in eſpetiall. He ſayd if the people conuertyd not from there doyng of ile / God would kepe promeſe withe them / and deſtroy there land. but they belyuyd it not but ſayd. Templum domini, Templum domini, Templum domini. The temple of God / the temple of God / the temple of God. They iudgyd then as many doo now aday when they ſe there cites / and contre ſtrong they thynke it is not poſſible to be ouercom. So thowghe the Troianes and deceauyd

And this is not alight and ſmale let for men that hathe offendyd. And is contrarie vnto Preſumption / for preſumption hathe ſomme ſimile and ſhew of hope / for all thowghe man offend the will of God / yet doothe he truſt in the doyng and perſeueraunce of ile that God will not punyſhe.
               The whyche impiete and wyckidnis / takythe from God his iuſtice. Of the contrarie nature is deſperation / it takythe from God his mercye. For when they offend and continew in ſynne / they thincke there is no mercie leffte for them. The whiche ſinne and blaſphemie thus procedithe

Beholdithe the examples in whom God exequutid the ſame rigure and puniſhment / that his cōſcience is oppreſſyd with all. conſiderithe his awne ſtrenghte / whiche is prone vnto nothing but vnto ile. Seythe how difficile / and hard the thinges be / that God commaundithe / ſpecially becauſe of his accuſtome and long contineaunce in ſynne.

his onlie ſonne for it / that all that belyue in him / cannot peryſhe / but hathe liefe euer laſtyng / and ſo / Ioan. 6. He that belyuythe in me hathe euer laſting liefe.
               But vnto this way of lieffe (to Chriſt by faith) all men be not browght after one ſort. For as mannis lieffe is not mayntainid withe one kynd of mete / but the childed withe pappe / the full ayge withe ſtronger meates / the elthe withe commune metes / the ſyckenis withe ſouche as be of lighter digeſtion: ſo is it in bryngyng man to faithe in Chriſt Ieſu oure ſauioure. one doctrine and lerning cannot do it / becauſe there be diuerſe ſortes of people / in the worold. Somme Hypocrites / that would iuſtifie them ſelfes by there workes.
               Theſe know not the greatnis of ſinne / nether there awne imperfection / nether the damnation of God agaynſt ſynne / Ioan. 16. This man ſhuld not haue the fre remiſſion of ſynne in Chriſt Ieſu preachyd vnto hym / but the lawe and tenne commaundementes / that by it / he lerne fyrſt to know the horror of ſinne and greatnis of Godes Ire againſt it.
               An other ſort lyue without all fere / and honeſtie / a filthie lieffe / as well of thoſe that confeſſe the goſpell / as thoſe that hatihe it: thoſe becauſe

they know not the abhomination of there ſynne / and the ſeuerite of Godes angre againſt it / be not mete to haue the goſpell of remiſſion of ſynne preachyd vnto them / but to be inſtructyd in the lawe / and rather browght to afere of Godes puniſhment / that remainithe for all impenitent perſones. they ſhuld be excommunicatyd / and puniſhyd withe the diſcipline of Godes word / that fyrſt they might know there ſynne / and acknolege there damnation. Thus Chriſt tawght the yong man that truſtid in his awne workes / Matth. 19. Marc. 10. Luc. 18. becauſe he was an Hypocryte / he preachyd not vnto him the goſpell of fre remiſſion of ſynne / but ſend him to the law and to the workes therof / not that he ment man could fulfyll the law / or iuſtifie him ſelfe by the worckes therof: or that Chriſt would not he ſhuld be part taker of his mercy / but that the hypocrite might cum to acknolege of his ſynnes / the Ire of God / and damnation of him ſelfe by the lawe.
               The whiche thinge knowen / he ſhuld be conſtrainid of neceſſite / to ſyke his ſaluation by faythe in Chriſt Ieſu / except he would peryſhe in his ſynne. Sainct Paule dyd not byd the Corinthions preache faithe and remiſſion of ſynne vnto the adulterour that continewyd in ſinne: but byd them excommunicat him / and as many as

dyd like offence / and that no man ſhuld eat or drynke with him / 1. Corinth. 5.

No part of my bodie fre from payne / becauſe I haue ſynnyd. For I am drownyd in ſynne and the puniſhment there of is more wayghtie then I can bare.

So Chriſt preachyd vnto Marie Magdalynne Luce. 7. For as ſhe had mooſt grounſlie offendid / ſo knewe ſhe here ſelfe / and was afflictyd with the dolours of hell. whē ſhe came to Chriſt to know the way to heauen / he ſend here not vnto the law / for the law had fyrſt donne here offyce in here and made here aferd. Therefore poure wreche /

To ſay / ſouche as hathe trowghe Chriſt remiſſion of there ſinne / and walkithe by faithe in the vocation of God / yet duryng this mortall liefe barithe about with them / the reliques and remanent of ſinne in there bodys. to theſe men preachithe Saynct Paule the Goſpell / Rom. 8. Nulla condemnatio eſtijs, qui inſiti ſunt Chriſto Ieſu. That is to ſay: There is no condemnation vnto them that ar graffyd in Chriſt Ieſu / leſt this man ſhuld to mouche ſuſtaine the waight of the lawe as Paule makythe exclamation for fere of the rigure of it in the 7. chap. Rom. Farther vnto this man it is alſo neceſſarij to mē
                  gle the law now / and then / to this end to kepe him in his office / in the fere of God / that by the law the affections of the fleſhe may be kept vnder / and by the Goſpell / may be preſeruyd the ſprit / and ardor of faithe.
               This is to preache in the churche of God. Not to fere the ſorowfull cōſciens withe the rigure of the lawe: nether to flatter thoſe Hypocrites / Epicures / and laſciuious goſpellers withe the promeſſe of faithe / vntill ſouche tyme as they amend / and the law donne his office in thē. And in caſe preachers had vſyd / ād applied the ſcripture to the vſe it was wroten / and as there

               THe ſyxt let or impedimēt where withe mē excuſe them ſelfes from the obediēce of the lawe of god / is the pretence of ignorauncie / the whiche they thinke ſhall excuſe them.

Other ſay I haue no witt to vnder ſtand the word of God / and if I had yet haue I no leaſure to lerne it. Againſt this obiection Moſes anſwerithe / ād ſaythe this law is ſufficient / is ſimple / and plaine / eaſe to be vndreſtand / a perfet doctrine / and requirid of all men. Thus he prouyth it. Preceptum iſtud quod ego praecipio tibi hodie non eſt mirabiliter ſupra te, nec procul poſitum, Deut. 30. that is to ſay the cōmaundemēt that I preſcribe vnto the to daie is not far aboue the / nor put far frō the. Rede the laſt halfe of the chapiter. By the whiche wordes it apperithe that God hathe made his will / and pleaſure / ſimple / and playnly open vnto his people / with apt ſentencis / and open wordes / and alſo put the ſame nere vnto vs that we ſhuld not ſeke it with great danger of oure lieffe / to ſayle into the Indies for it / or loke it in heauen a boue as thoſe that receaue all thynges by reuelation or apparitions of Angelles / or othere ſouche meanes. But Moſes ſaythe it is no nede of ony ſouche Embaſſadours / and ſo faythe Abraham Luc. 16. for man may lerne out of the

ſcripture what is to be donne / and what not to be donne / what is the condition of the good / and of the bad. No nede to ſeke the knolege there of in Aegypt / Athenes / or Rome.
