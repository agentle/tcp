boke declarethe howe faithfully Iſaye
watched & wayted on his flok / wt what
conſtancy he warned / how ſharpely he
corrected & rebuked & at laſte conforted
the zagene. This prophete was in lyke
troublouſe tyme & ſynful worlde as we
ar now: when deſtrucciō & captiuite was
at hande / & men wer fled bakwarde frō
ye true worſhype of god to ye worſhippinge

confidence in vtwarde work is & holynes

inuented of their owne braines: when al
was done with powr & tyranye / with oute

Wherby we may wel ſee y• merciful goodnes

            ¶When men ar geuen to ſynne & luſte / then
ſette thei al their myndes to diſgoyſe
their ſelfe / & ſo to playe the hypocrites
yt what ſo eur they do / it ſhalbe ſo kraftely
handled / ſo coloured / ſo paynted
yt it maye apere well & rightuouſly / ye &

Prophete / we muſte conſyder y• we

xvij. Not withſtandinge yet ar we
aftyr y• fleſſhe the verye gentyles whō
god of his mercy hath called into the place
of the Iwes to benamed his people.
We muſte alſo remember in readīge this
boke that Iſaye preacheth to vs & not
to the carnall Iſrael only. It is we that
nowe labour in lyke idolatrye ād ſynne / let
vs therfore take his warninges ād

throw faith ar cutoute of the ſtone yt

Egipte there oppreſſed in harde ſeruitute:
we deſcende into our owne wayes oppreſſed
with ſynne for the which we are
vnder the daunger of hell & dethe. Iſrael
had their paſſe ouer in the rememberaunce
of their delyuerance out of Egipt
we haue owr lambe chriſte offred for vs
into a perpetuall memoriall of owr delyueraunce
frome ſynne hell & deth. Iſrael
for their vnbelefe was forſaken / blynded
/ & aſſayled of the Madianites / Amalekts
/ of y• Aſſyriōs of y• Antiochens
& Rhomans / which brente their temple

            ¶Owte of Iſayes ſchole it pleaſed
god to ſende theſe two lights / that is to
ſaye Ioan baptiſte and Paule: hym to y•
blinde phary ſayes & to their blinde diſciples
the Iwes / & this to illumyn the gentyls
ſittinge yet in derkenes. Ioan baptiſte
with oute doute preached many a
ſermone to many men before thei flocked
forth ſo faſte to hym to be baptized cō
               feſſinge
their ſynnes / but oute of what
prophets ſchole he was ſente / the theme
and argument of his ſermons / the roughe
rebukinge ād ſharpe threatening ſo
frely ſo boldely with oute feare of man
of what eſtate ſo ever he was playnely

declareth. Sayde he not frely to the phariſayes
and Saduceys. Mat. iij. For all
they were in ſo grete opinion and autorite
with the people for their vtwarde holynes
/ ſayde he not openly to theſe hypocrytes
/ O ye edders whelpes who ſhal
ſhewe you the waye to auoyde the vengeance
to come? And with Paule was
there no Prophete ſo familiare ſo ready
to proue and to confirme his ſayinges
as was Iſaye / as it aperethe in his
piſtels & ſermons / eſpecially in his piſtle
to the Romans. Where yn the nienthe
and tenthe Chapit. When he came vnto
the callinge of the Gentyles into the
place of the Iwes nowe fallen awaye ād
reiected (whiche callinge of the Gentyles
and fall of the Iwes Iſaye ſawe ād
prophecyed here moſte clearly) how thicke

name brīgīge ī his ful ſentences & hol teſtimones
garneſhinge his piſtle wt thez
as y• ſtarres ornowerne y• firmamēt? ſo yt
it maye be thought he watrd not his gardēs
of eny othr prophets ryuers ſo plentuouſly

& ſo ofte / as he dyd of Iſayes
ſwete floudes runninge in them ſo puerly
ſo plentuouſly and ſo ſwetely. But
what nedeth me to remember the ſeruants
when y• Maſter of all broughtyn
no prophets teſtimones ſo ſone as he dyd
his prophet Iſays the ſonne of Amoz?
As when he came to Nazareth wher he
was broughtup & aftyr the cuſtome entred
into their Synagoge on the Sabbath
daye and roſup to reade his leſſon / there
was delyuerde him the boke of Iſaye
the prophete as ye maye ſe Luce. iiij.
which he opened and fyndinge this place
of Iſaye in the .lxj. chap. redde ſaynge
The ſpirit of god is with me / for the lorde
hathe anoynted me / and ſente me to
preache his goſpel to the poore afflicte &
troubled in mynde / to byndup the woundis
of thē yt ar wounded & cōtrite ī harte
/ to ſhewforth delyueraunce to men in
captiuite / & to open ye preſon to men in holde
/ to publeſſhe the tyme of grace decreed
of the lorde. & cetera. And when he
had redde / he ſhitte the boke and reſtored

it to y• miniſtre of the Synagoge.
            And nowe at the laſte (the worlde corrupte
with the ſame Idolatrye ād lyke
abhominaciō as it was in Iſayes tyme
& at Chriſtes comynge / vhom therfore
ther muſte nedes abyde lyke deſtruccion
& captiuite / if we be not captyue al redye)
God of his infinite goodnes hathe
reſtored vs his prophete Iſaye ſpeakinge
playne englyſſhe which haue ben locked
vp longe in latyne ſo yt the laye mā
(I dare ſaye) vnderſtode hym not / nor
yet parauenture many that repute thez
ſelfe learned. Nowe maye we reade him
for the moſte parte gatherīge grete frute
with oute eny grete gloſe / ſo yt we bringe
withe vs a pure harte purged from
all carnall affects aſkynge vnderſtandinge
of god by whoſe ſpirit it was al ſpoken:
ſo that we knowlege oure vngodlynes
our Idolatrye & falſe worſhipe
with our lippes / our hartes beinge farre
frō god which hitherto haue: rendred feare
& worſhip to him aftyr the doctryne
and cōmaundemēts of men Iſaye .xxix

ethr ſyde / y• goodnes of god hath euer ſet

which is ſone puftvp wt y• haſtye wynde

All are woundes / runninge ſores / ful of

And thou people of Gomorre / take

this incēſe is abhominacion to me: your

when ye ſhal ſtretch forth your handes

If ye wil heare and be ruled / ſhal ye not

And excepte ye be aſhamed of your ſtockes

                  ANd nowe therfore wil I ſinge vnto

made hym a vyne yarde in a

he cloſed rownde a boute withe a

the moſte nobleſte vyne: In the middes
of it he ſet vp a tower and made ther yn

grapes / & it yilded thornes. wherfor
nowe O ye citeſens of Ieruſalē & al y•

yowe / decerne yowe betwene me and

my vyne yarde / what thinge more coulde
I haue done to my vyne yarde which

hath it brought me forth thornes?
Suerly I ſhal ſhewe you therfor what

But ye lorde of powrs roundeth me ī

wo be to the haunters of dronkenes
which ryſe erly to drinke / cōtinuinge in

bankets there are harpes and futes
taberet & pype waſhed with wyne. but
in the meane tyme / the very worke of
the lorde thei beholde not / nether conſyder
thei what his hādes haue made. Be
cauſe therfore that my people hath no
knowledge / thei ar ſone brought into captiuite
/ their nobles are made thynne
with honger / and the proude multitude
pereſheth for thirſte: And for this cauſe
the helles haue opened their vnſaciable
throtes and their mouthes gape be yende
meſure / that thither mought deſcende
pryde / pompe / riches / and al that are
addicte to theſe vices. Thus is man plucked
downe / the ſtowte ſtoupeth / and
highe lokes are abated: but the Lorde of

powers and the holy god is exalted and
ſtableſhed into a gloriouſe exēple of equite

Wo be vnto theſe vayne ſkorners which

in whoſe mouthes are al wayes the

that at is bitter / they ſaye is ſwete / ād
ſwete to be bitter. Wo be to thez that at

in their owne iugemente.
Wo be vnto theſe grete drinkers of wyne

/ and to men hardye to receyue dronkenes:
which abſolue ye wiked for giftes
and condempne the iuſte for his rightwiſnes:
wherfore lyke as ye tonge of the

/ their rote putrifyed / the flowr of them
ſhal vayneſſhe a waye lyke duſte which

/ and deſpyſe the worde of hym that
maketh holye Iſrael: wherfore ye wrathe
of the lorde is kyndled agenſte his

ſmyte them / that theſe hilles mought
tremble / and theire karcaſes mought
lye ſtinkinge lyke dongehills in the highe
wayes. And yet after al this ſhal
he nothinge abate his wrathe / but ſhal
yet farther ſtretche forth his hande
/ & ſhal geve a token to the ſtraunge nacion
a farreof / whiſtelinge thē frome the

/ their girdles a boute their raynes thei

latchets of their ſhoes / their arows are
ſharpe and their bowes redye bente / their
horſe howves ſhode as ſharpe as flyntes
/ and the wheles of their charyets
turninge lyke a whirlewinde. This
nacion roreth lyke a lyon / and grenneth
lyke the lyons whelpes / they ſhal

/ nether ſhal there be one that maye eſcape

Thei ſhal grenne vpon the people of Iſrael
at yt tyme like a fyerce ſea. Then
if we beholde the erthe / lo / all ſhalbe derkenes

the ſtarres: lo / they ſhalbe derkened into

                  THe yeare in the whiche Dzias
the kynge dyed: I ſee the Lorde
ſittinge in an highe ſeate all aboue
/ and the trayne of his robe filled y•
temple. And the Seraphims apered above
ouer him / and eche of them had ſiye
winges: with two of their wīges thei

kouerde their faces / & with two thei
kouerde their fete / and withe the tother
two they flewe / and they kryed to eche
other ſayinge: Holy / holy / holy is ye lorde of powers: all the erthe be fulfylled
with his gloriouſe maieſtye: ye and the
poſtes with their windowes were moued
at the voyce of theſe angels kryinge
& ye ſame houſe was ful of ſmoke: then
ſayde I / Ah laſſe / for I was a ſtonned
in aſmych as I me ſelfe beynge a man
hauynge polluted lippes / and conuerſaunte
withe people hauinge alſo polluted
lippes / yet not withſtandinge / had
ſene with my eyes a kinge / even the lorde
of powers. Then one of the Seraphims
flwe vnto me bringinge a quicke
cole taken ſrome the alter with a payer
of tonges: and he touched my lippes ſaynge
theſe wordes: beholde / as ſone as
this cole hath touched thi lippes thy in
iquitie is gone / and thy ſinne is purged.
Farthermore I harde the voice of the
lorde takinge aduyſmente on this maner:
whome ſhal I ſende? Or who ſhal

go on ower meſſage? And then anſwerde
I: lo / here at your pleſure to ſende me
And he ſayde: Go thy wayes and ſaye
vnto this people / ye ſhal heare verely / and
yet ſhal ye not vnderſtonde / and ye
ſhal ſee playnly / but yet ſhal ye not knowe:
Make groſſe and fatte the hartes
of this people / make thicke their eares / and
kover their eyes / leſte thei ſee with
their eyes / or heare with their eares / or
vnderſtande with their hartes ād ſo be
conuerted and ſaued. And here I begane
to ſpeake for them ſayinge: howe longe
my lorde? vntil the cytes (ſayde he)
be deſtitute their dwellers / & not a man
lefte in the houſes / and the grownde be
layed voyde: For ful farre ſhal the lorde
baneſhe the men / and there ſhalbe
grete deſtructiō in the londe: but yet ſhall
there be lefte a tythe in it to returne
a gene / ſo that their paſture ſhalbe
reſtored: and as their okes and lyne trees

holy ſeade ſhoteforth frutefully emonge

               The ſeventh Chapiter.
               
                  THen was it ſo / that in the raigne
of Ahaz ye ſonne of Iotham
the ſonne of Ozias kinge of Iuda:
Rezin the kinge of Aram and Phecca
the ſonne of Romelie kinge of Iſrael
aſcended to Ieruſalem to laye ſege agenſte
it: whiche at that tyme they myght
not wynne: & then tolde they the houſe
of Dauid that the Syryons wer confederde
with Ephraim / which tydynges
made Ahaz with the houſe of Dauid
to trēble lyke trees in the wode ſmyten
with wynde. wherfor the lorde ſayde
vnto Iſaye. Haue done and get the
forthe with thy ſonne Iaſus whiche is
lefte the / and mete Ahazat ye heade of
the over pole in the waye towerde the
ſuffers felde / and ſaye vnto hym. Se yt
thou be ſtill & feare not / let not thy harte
melte at theſe two tayles with theyr
ſmokynge fyerbrandes / that is to ſaye
at the furye of Rezin kynge of the Syrions
/ and of the ſonne of Romelye becauſe
the Syrions / Ephraim / and Romelis
ſonne haue thus myſcheuouſly counſelde

and conſpyred agenſte the / ſaynge.
We will go vp into Iuda and ſcourge
them and tranſlate them vnto vs / and
we ſhal ſette the ſonne of Tabal to
be kinge ouer them: For even thus ſayth
the lorde: This thinge ſhall not ryſe
nor come to paſſe: but Damaſcus ſhalbe
y• head of Syria / & Rezin ſhalbe ye head
of Damaſcꝰ: & aftyr .65. yeares / Ephraī
karyed awaye ſhal no more be ye people:
although now Samarya be head of
Ephraim / ād ye ſonne of Romelye ye heade
of Samaria: If ye beleve not / yowe
are but gone to. And beſydis thys / the
Lorde commaunded hym to ſaye thꝰ alſo
vnto Ahaz. Aſke the ſome token of ye
Lorde thy God / whether it be frome ye
deapeſt benethe or frome the hygheſt above.
And Ahaz anſwerde: I wil not aſke
/ nether will I tempte the Lorde. Wherfore
he ſayde. Heare then ye houſe of
Dauid / is it not enough for yowe to veye
men / but ye muſt wearye my god to?
The lorde therfore his owne ſelfe ſhall
geve yow a tokē. Beholde / a mayde ſhalbe

with chylde and bringeforth a ſonne
and ſhe ſhall call his name Immanuel.
Boter and honey ſhal he eate vntil
he can eſchewe yuel and choſe good: notwithſtandynge
before this childe be thꝰ
waxen / thy londe ſhalbe deſolated / for y•
which thou arte ſo a frayde of their two

thy fathers houſe / ſiche dayes as haue
not ben ſene frome the departinge of Ephraym
from Iuda: that is to ſaye / he
ſhal bringe vpon yowe the kynge of the
Aſſyrions: For the tyme ſhal come that
the lorde ſhal whyſtle for a flye whiche
dwelleth beyende the flowde of Egypte
& for bees which ar in the lande of the
Aſſyrions / which ſhal come all hole togither
and beſege the even with yn thy
drye dykes at the kaves with in the rockes
/ in every wode / & at euery ſtertinge

ſhaue the with a raſer / he ſhal hyer a raſer
beyende the flowde Euphrates / even
the kynge of the Aſſyryons: and he

ſhal ſhave of the heares of thy heade &
fete / and even thy verye berde ſhall he
wype of: then ſhal the tyme come that a
man ſhal lyue with a kowe ād tway e
                  
                     •
                  es
/ and for the plentye of mylke eate
boter: for yet ſhal every on lefte in the
myddes of the lande eate boter and honey
/ and yet in thoſe dayes a vyne yarde
of a thouſand vynes bought for more
then a thouſand penys ſhal be turned
into bryers and thornes: For the kinge
of the Aſſyrions ſhal not come hither
armed ſo thicke withe bowe and arows
as the bryers and thornes ſhall ſtande
over al this region: Alſo euery frutefull
hill which was wonte to be delved and
ploughed / then ſhal not a man come to
them for feare of thornes & bryers / but
ſhal ſerue to put yn heardes / ād beaſtes

               The aight Chapiter.
               
                  ANd then ſayde the Lorde agene
to me: take the a grete rolle ād
wryte yn it withe a pen lyke a
man Maherſchalal haſchbaz
which ys to ſaye / haſte the to robbe / ſpede

the to ſpoyle. Then I toke me certayne
faithfull witneſes / vry the preſte &
Zachary the ſonne of Barachy: and came
vnto a prophetiſe which had now cō
                  ceyued
and brought forth a ſonne: & the
Lorde ſpake vnto me. Geve hym this
name: haſtye robber gredy ſpoyler: for before
thys chylde can call Dadye & Mā
                  mye
he ſhal bare away the riches of Damaſce
and the proye of Samarye / yn y•
ſight of the kynge of Aſſyrye. And agene
the Lorde ſpake vnto me theſe wordes.
For aſmych as this people abhorreth
the waters of Siloah that flowe ſo
ſtill / and hathe rather pleſure in thys
kynge Rezin and in the ſonne of Romely:
Lo / the lorde therfore ſhal let the grete
myghtye flowdis breke in vpon them
/ that is to ſaye the kinge of the Aſſyrions
withe all his power: whiche ſhal
aryſe every where a bove their ryuers
and run over all their bankes dryuynge
into Iuda / redowndyng and ſwellyngevp
even to theyr throtes: And
the tyme ſhal come that the ſpreadinge

a brode of their winges ſhal kover the
breadeth of thy lande / O Immanuel.
Get ye togither / ye people into counſel / and
all ye of the fartheſte partes of the
lande caſte yower heades togither / haſte
ye togither to take counſell: and yet
ſhall all togither be yn vayne. Conclude
ye vpon eny thynge / and yet ſhall it
not come to paſſe / excepte Immanuel.
Thus then ſayd the Lorde vnto me takynge
me by the hande lyke a guyde &
nourteringe me that I ſhulde not go in
the waye of this people ſaynge. Breke
not yower myndes aboute eny confederation
with other for eny helpe: for althoughe
this people ſpeaketh of nothinge
but of coniurations and confederations:
yet let them not fraye yow: but ſanctifie
yowe the Lorde of powers: hī feare
/ hym dreade ye: for it is he that is y•
very holymakynge and the ſtomblynge
ſtone alſo: even a rocke to fal at / ſnare
and net to ether of y• houſes / that is
to ſaye to Iſrael / and to them that dwell
aboute Ieruſalem: and many ſhall

ſtomble at hym / they ſhall fall / they ſhalbe
broken / they ſhalbe trapt and taken.
Nowe (ſayth the Lorde) rollvp thys
teſtemony / and ſealevp the lawe withe
my diſciples. Nowe ſhal I loke for the
lorde (faith Iſaye) whiche hath hyd his
face frome the houſe of Iacob / and I ſhal
truſte yn hym / both I me ſelfe and ye
ſeruantes whom the Lorde hath geven
me to be a miracle and woundre yn Iſrael
for the lorde of powers pleſure that
dwelleth yn the mounte Zion. And when
men ſhall ſaye to yowe (O my childerne
and diſciples of the lorde) aſke counſell
of the Pythonyts and ſoth ſayers
of ſorcerers and charmers: then anſwere
yowe ſaynge: do not euery nacion aſke
counſel and knowledge of theyr owne
goddes? ſhal they then aſke of y• dede
to know thinges concerninge the lyuinge?
gete ye to the lawe and to goddes
teſtymones: for who ſo ever ſpeaketh
not aftyr theſe wordes they ar not of y•
morninge lyght. If a man be negligent
and dyſpyſe the lawe / he ſmyteth hymſelfe

agenſte a rok and faileth of his porpoſe
/ and when he thus failethe of his

that he ſhal curſe his kynge & his

or downwarde to the grownde:
lo / all are full of anguyſhe derknes and
tribulacion floteringe aboute hym with

The londe of Zabulon and Neptalim

as men reioyſe in their reapīge & as mē

and the gouernaunce ſhalbe put / and he

& yet ſhal he therwith nouryſhe peace
/ ſittinge in the ſeat regall of Dauid / ād
in his kingdome / to mayntayne it in
equyte & rightwyſnes frome thence into
euerlaſtinge: the zele of y• lorde of powers
ſhal bringe this to paſſe. The lorde
ſente a worde into Iacob and it fell into

Iſrael: which all the people ſhal know
/ euen Ephraim & the citeſens of Samarye
althoughe yet of a prowde harte
thei ſaye thus: Ower buldīges of brycke
are ſmyttē downe / but we ſhal buylde
thē agene with fower ſqwared ſtones:
ower houſes of wilde figtres ar broken
downe / but we ſhal reſtore thē buylded
with Cedre trees: wherfore y• lorde
ſhal ſtere vp Reſin with other enemes
vpon thez: whom he ſhal ſo diſpoſe &
ordre that Syrus ſhal come yn vpon y•
fronte of Iſrael / and the paleſtines ſhal
come in on their backes ād devower them
with open mouthe: and yet for al this
ſhal he not ſwage his wrath / but ſhal
yet ſtretche forth his hande: for nether
the people returneth vnto hym that
plaged them / nor yet ſeke thei the lorde
of powers. wherfore y• lorde ſhal kutof
from Iſrael both toppe and tayle braunche
and bande al at once / by the toppe
vnderſtande thou the aldermā and him
yt bearethe rule / by y• tayle vnderſtande
thou the prophete that preachethe lyes

For they whiche preache this people to
be happye or bleſſed / are deceyuers / and
they that are thoughte happye emonge
them are the moſte nygheſt their deſtruction.
Wherfore the Lorde delighteth
not in their yongons and is vnmerciful
vnto the fatherles and to their wedews
/ for thei ar al hypocryts and kurſed
and thei al ſpeake foliſhnes: and yet for
all this ſhall he not ſwage his wrathe
but ſtretche ſtil forth his hande: For their
vngodlynes burneth lyke fyer which
is noureſhed with brambles and thornes
/ and the ſmoke of their pryde fleethforth
lyke ye ſmoke of fyer that is fallen
emonge thycke bryers: wherfore the

And if eny man turne hym on his righthande

yet ſhal he fynde no fode / every man ſhal

               What then ſhal ye do in the daye of viſitation

And yet for all this ſhal he not ſwage
his wrathe but ſtretche ſtill forthe

of my wrathe which holdethe the

for I muſte ſende hym emonge hypocrytes

my Indignacion ſhal I ſende him to robbe

and to ſpoile thez of al that thei haue
/ & to ſtampe them vnder his fete lyke

y• thinge / nether thus thinke it in
his harte: but hitherto loketh his harte
his luſte is to deſtroye ād to wype awaye
with his ſwerde not a fewe folke / for
thus thinketh he ſaynge with hymſelfe:
Are not al other kinges and princes
trybutares vnto me? ſhal not I ſubdwe
to me Calenum as eaſelye as Charchamim?
and as ſone take Antioch as I
haue Arphad? and Damaſe as Samariam?
(as who ſaye) I haue goten by
my nowne power theſe kingdoms in y•
which Idols & karued images ar worſhiped
/ and can I not then get Ieruſalē
and Samarye? ſhall not I be as able to
do to Ieruſalem and to hir Images as I
haue done to Samarye and to hir goddes?
Then the tyme ſhal come (ſaith ye

in the mounte of Zion and Ieruſalem
/ yt I muſte vyſet and loke vpon this

Ioylye byrde and ſo fortunate a felowe
even vpon the ſtoute harte of the kynge
of the Aſſyrions and vpon his hyghe loke:
for thus he thinketh of him ſelfe: by
my nowne power and wyſdome do I theſe
thinges: for I am wiſe: It is I that
haue taken awaye ye cooſtes of ye nacions
and haue ſpoyled their princes: ād
I lyke a gyaunte haue plucked downe
men ſittinge a lofte: and the hoſtes of ye
innumerable people with theyr ſubſtaunce
are al brought into my handes as
egges into a neſte: for I haue gatherd to
me euery region of the erthe even as ſcatred
egges are gatherd togither into one
place / and there is not one in the meane
tyme that dare move his winge / yt
dare open his mouthe or once chatter agenſte
me. But (I praye yowe) dothe y•
axe glorye agenſte hym that vſethe it
to cutte therwith? Or doth ye ſawe magnyfye

of? this were as lyke as though the rodde

Wherfore the Lorde God of powers
ſhal ſende penurye into hys plentuouſnes

ſhalbe his fyer / and Iſraels ſanctuarye

but by faithe they ſhall truſte to

the Lorde god of powers: be not a

for then the Lorde of powers ſhal ſterevppe

from thenſe ſhal he conne into Migron
In Machmas ſhall he nowmber hys

But yet beholde / for the Lorde

heade and ſhoue his berde. Thei ſtode

gyrte in ſacke in every korner of the towne.
Vpon their houſe toppes / and in y•
ſtretes every man kryed oute and fell to
wepinge. Heſebon and Eleale kryed ſo
lowde that their voyces were harde to
Iahaz / and the ſoudgiers of Moab when
thei ſhulde haue blowne vp theire
trompetes to batayle / for ſorowe of their
hartes they kryed ah laſſe for ſorowe / ower
hartes blede vpon Moab fleinge
towerd Zoar that welthye bullok / and
vpon the hanging of the hyll of Luhith
they clymed withe wepinge. Alſo the
waye of Horonaim they filled with theire
lamentable noyſe. The waters of
Nemrim were forſaken and the graſſe
was wytherd awaye. Corne fayled / ād
there was no grene thinge lefte. And even
aftyr this maner the reſte of theyr
ſubſtaunce and goodes theyr aduerſares
karied a waye to Arabye proſperouſly
by ſhippe. And to be ſhorte / the noyſe
wente thorowe al the cooſtes of Moab
ſo that frome Eglaim vnto Beer Elim
all was fylle dwith theyr howlinge.
               
               The waters of Dimon were full of bloude
/ for there laye the hoſte waytynge

               Then ye lorde of ye lande ſente a ſouldyer
frome the ſtoney deſerte vnto
the hill of the daughter of Zion
(for the daughters of Moab abode
yet at the foorde of Arnon lyke tremblinge
byrds put oute of their neſtes) which
meſſagere requyred them thus ſaynge.
Gather togither yower ſenatours &
take counſell howe ye myghte ſhadewe
and defende vs in this hot perſecution / hyde
them that flee / and deſtroye not ye
diſperſed / let ower Moabytes fled vnto
yowe be ſoukerde / hyde vs from the
face of the deſtroyer / for ower enymes
trede vs downe: this deſtroyer ceaſſeth
not to waſte vs a waye frome the erthe:
For the ſeate of yower kyngdome is
ful of mercye / wherfore he that ſittethe
in it muſte iuge of faithfulnes and trowthe
as in the tabernacle of Dauid / he

muſte ſeke equite & haſte hym to mayntayne
the righte. Vnto the which requeſte
it was thus anſwerde. Moabs pryde
is wel knowne and howe grete it is
His Arrogancye & ſwellinge furye was
never ſo grete but his ſtrength is nowe
as ſmall. Wherfore let Moab complayne
of his fall to hym ſelfe / that he mought
all alone lamente / and that he alſo
thus broken with ſorowe mought ſit
complayninge and moorninge in vayne
at the fete of che brycke walles of Arnon
nowe caſte downe. Alſo Iſawe thoſe
ſuburbes of Heſebon deſtroyed: The
vyneyardes of Sibme planted withe ye
moſte nobleſte vynes which reched vnto
Iazer and ſpred vnto the deſerte / hyr
branches ſpred vnto ye weſte ſea the pears
of Gentyles dyd kut downe. Wherfore
I wepte for Iazer and for the vyneyardes
of Sibme / I waterde the vyneyarde
of Heſbonam and Elealen with
the teares of my eyes / becauſe that in
their harueſte and in the gatheringe of
their grapes theire wonte mery ſonges

were gone / their myrth was layed in bed
/ both of felde and vyne yarde / ſo that
they coulde nether be glade nor ſynge: ye
treder in ye vyne preſſe trede out no more
wyne / their harueſte and grape gatheringe
ſonges were layed downe. Wherfore
my belye murmuerde lyk an harpe
for Moab / and even my bowels alſo for
that bryk walle. For when Moab ſee that
hyr goodes were in perell ſhe weared
hir ſelfe going to hyr Idols in highe
places and to hyr holy houſes to praye / but
non might helpe hyr. This is ye worde
which the lorde ſpake then vpon
Moab: but nowe the lorde ſpeaketh on
this maner. Aftyr thre yeares / the power
of Moab with al hyr pompe & ryches
(which ar very mych) ſhalbe taken
a waye / evē as an hyerde ſeruante his
yeares oute ſerued is quyte gone / ād hir
reamnauntes ſhalbe ful fewe ād of ſmall
valewe.

Damaſcus ſhal nomore

an heape of ſtones. The cites of Aroer
ſhalbe turned into paſture & layers for
flockes of ſhepe ād other heardes ſo that
noman ſhal fraye them a waie Ephraim
ſhal nomore be ſtrōge defenſed / Damaſcus
ſhalbe nomore a kingdome.
Alſo the glorye of the lefte cytes of Syrie
ſhalbe lyke the glorye of the chylderne
of Iſrael ſaith the lorde of powers / then
ſhal the glorye of Iacob be ful thynne
/ and the well lykinge of theire fatte
bodyes ſhalbe full leane. For they ſhalbe
lyke a gatherer of corne yet ſtādinge
after the ſykle which reapeth down the
handfulles withe his Arme / but when
he gathereth or thruſteth them togither
(even in the valye of Rephaim) yet he
levethe ſom what for the gleaners: they
ſhalbe lyke one beatingeof olyve beryes
which yet leveth two or thre beryes
in the toppe and not paſſinge fower
or fyve in all the other bouwes ſaithe ye
lorde god of Iſrael. Then ſhal man returne
vnto his maker and his eyes ſhall

loke vnto hym that maketh holye Iſrael:
and ſhall not loke vnto Altars the
worke of theyr handes nethr ſhal he beholde
thoſe thinges whiche his owne
fyngers made / nether wordes / nor ymages.
Then ſhal the ſtronge cytes be lefte
deſolate as were the ploughes & harows
ſometyme (of the chananites) for
feare of the chylderne of Iſrael. Becauſe
thou haſt forgoten god thy ſaviower
and not remembred thy ſtronge rocke / therfore
haſt thou planted the ſo fayer
ſettes and ſowne the ſo ſtraunge ſeades
When thou plantedſte them / thou waſte
riche and in thy flowers and beleuedſte
to haue had fulerlye frutes of thy
ſeade: But when the tyme ſhall come to
gather and to poſſeſſe them / thou ſhalt
reape right plentuouſe afflicciō and ſorowe.
Wo be to this confuſe cluſtre and
monſtroſe multitude of ſo prowde people
ſwellinge lyke the ſea whiche haithen
hoſte ryſeth vp lyke a fearce water.
               But let this heady folke / be they never
ſo many / neuer ſo vnrulye and lawles

ſwell / yet as ſone as the Lorde blameth
them and ſette agenſte them / thei ſhall
flee full farre a waye / and ſhalbe wynnowed
of the wynde lyke the duſte of ye
drye mountayne / and lyke a whirlewynde
at the comynge of a ſtorme: For lo / lyke
as at the eveninge thei were mervelouſe
terrible / ſo before the morninge
ſhal thei begone. This is the very ende
of them that ſcourge vs / this is the
rewarde of them that robbe vs of ower

to reſte conſyderynge withe my ſelfe yn

ſhewed to Iſaye vppon Egypte.
Beholde / the lorde ſhal come
rydinge vpon a ſwyfte clowde into
Egypte: at whoſe cominge the Idols of
Egypte ſhal ſheake / ād the harte of Egypte
ſhal faynte in hyr owne bodye.
For I ſhal ſet the Egipcions (ſaith the
lorde) one agenſte a nother ſo that euery
man ſhal fyght with other / even brother
agenſte brother / cyte agenſte cyte / kyngdome
agenſte kyngdome / and the
breath of Egypte ſhalbe broken in hyr
belye / and I ſhal ſcater hyr counſel when
ſhe ſhal go aboute to aſke it of hir Idols
/ wytches / ſoth ſayers and diuyners.
I ſhal betake Egypte into the handes
of cruel lordes / and a violente kinge
ſhal rule thē / ſaith the lorde god of powers.
The waters of the ſea ſhal ſynke
awaye / and Nilus ſhalbe dryedup / their
flowdes ſhalbe dronke vp / and their dykes
and brooks ſhalbe ful ſhalowe and

fayle / reed and ruſhes ſhalbe wytherdvp
/ the medewes ād all the feldes a boute
Nilꝰ which wer wonte to wexe grene
at the openinge of hyr lippes ſhalbe
dryed vp and of no valwe. The fyſhers
ſhal morne / ād al that were wonte to
laye hokes & bende nettes at their waters
ſhal lamente: the ſpynners and makers
of lynyne / the ſylke wemen with ye
weavers therof ſhalbe begerde and cō
                  funded.
At that made pondes ād ſtwes
ſhal breke vp their bankes. Alſo the counſells
of the foleſſhe princes of Zoan &
the wyſe counſel of Pharao ſhalbe turned
al into felyſhnes. Howe dare ye then
be ſo bolde to ſaye vnto Pharao / I
am come of a wyſe ſtocke / ād I am of an
auncyāt noble bloude? where nowe / where
(I praye the) are thy wyſe men? let
them tell the nowe (I praye the) what ye
lorde entendeth and hath thought to do
with Egipte. The folyſhe prīces of Zoan
and the prowde princes of Mempheos
begylde Egipte with their noble hyghe
ſtocke. The lorde ſhall mingle the

ſprite of erroure emonge thez that then
ſhulde ſeduce Egipte in all thinges even
as the dronken and vomytinge man
is brought oute of the waye. Egipte ſhal
want counſel to convaye hyr cauſes / ſhe
ſhal not knowe where ſhe ſhal beginne
nor where ſhe ſhal make an ende / whether
it be vpon ye lande or ſea. Then
ſhall Egipte be lyke wemen / fearfull
and aſtōned at ye lyftinge vp of the hā
                  de
of the lorde of powers / which he ſhall
lyftup agenſt hyr. Alſo te lande of Iuda
ſhalbe a thondreclappe to Egipte / ſo that
who ſo euer mynde hyr to Egipte ſhe
ſhal a non be ſinayde with feare at ye counſel
of the lorde of powers whiche he
hath decreede agenſte hyr. Then ſhall
there be .v. cytes in the lande of Egipte
which ſhal ſpeake the Chananytes tonge
/ and ſhalbe ſworne vnto ye lorde of
powers / of the which one is called Heliopolis.
Alſo then ſhal there be an altar
for ye lorde in the myddes of Egipte entytlede
to the lorde to be into a ſigne and
teſtymonye for the lorde of powers in ye
                  
lande of Egipte / yt when thei krye vnto
him / for feare of their oppreſſours he mought
ſende them a ſaviowr and a guyde
which mought delyuer them. The
lorde ſhal knowe the Egypcions ād agene
the Egipcions ſhal knowe the Lorde
/ then ſhal thei worſhip him with ſacryfices
& gyftes. They ſhal vowe vnto
the lorde and performe it. Thus ſhal
the lorde ſmyte the Egypcions and heale
them agene / thus ſhal they be conuerted
to the lorde / and thus ſhal he be
merciful vnto them and ſhal heale thē.
Then ſhal the waye be comenly hawnted
frome Egypte to Aſſyria / and the
Aſſyrions ſhal come to the Egypcions
and Thegypcions agene to them / & thei
ſhall both worſhippe one God. Then
ſhal Iſrael with Egipte & Aſſyria make
all thre one bleſſed trinite in the myddes
of the erthe / which trinite the lorde
of powers ſhal bleſſe ſaynge: Bleſſed
be Egipte my people / bleſſed be the Aſſirions
ye worke of my handes / ād bleſſed

Come vp Elam / beſege it Mede

               When I harde this I fell downe / when
I ſe it I was amaſed. My harte trembled
and panted / I ſhoke for feare / & becauſe
this thīge was derke to me al my

was harde alſo: let the table be layed
ſodenly / and the watche wel apoynted

rydinge togither one of an aſſe and tother

of the which one hath brought this meſſage
and ſayd / Babylon is fallen / Babylon
is fallen in very dede / and all the
karued & graven Images of their Goddis
ar braſte agenſte the grounde: theſe
are the tydinges (o my felawes in worke

               The daye is come / and the night ſhall
come agene / and if ye be ſo deſyerouſe to

hevye affliccion layed vpon the Arabens.
ye ſhall lodge all nyght in the wode

For ſhall not the lorde ſmyte his ſmyters

ſhal he not ſlaye as he was ſlayne? what
meſure ſo ever mengeue / the ſame ſhall
they receyve agene. He bloweth forth
his vehemēt ſkorchinge wynde. Wherfore
the iniquite of Iacob is pourged
on this maner / and by this meanes he
taketh awaye all their ſynful ſeade: as
when he turnethe all the ſtones of their

In theſe dayes the lorde ſhal ſmyte downe

he wolde helpe yowe. It is the Lorde
verely that geueth yowe the brede

of affliccion and the water of heuynes.
But yet will not yower maſter abhorre

the ſone of Helkie preſident of the towne
houſe / Sobna the ſcrybe / and Ioas
the ſecreterye ſonne vnto A ſaphe.

vnto whome Rabſace ſpake thus / Go
yower wayes (I praye yow) and tel Ezekias
howe that the grete kinge of Aſſprye
hathe ſpoken theſe ſame wordes:
what is this thy confidence to which thou
ſtekeſt ſo faſte? Arte thow ſo folyſſh
hardye to thinke to haue counſel and
power to wage batayle? other in whome
nowe at laſte truſteſt thow ſo myche
that thow dareſt rebel agenſte me? I
ſhal tel the / thou truſteſt to the ayed ād
vpholdinge of this broken reede / that is
to an Egypcion / to the which reede whoſo
ever leaneth / he pearſeth his hande
and boreth it thorowe. Fore even ſiche
on is Pharao kinge of Egypte to al
that truſte vpon hym: but if thou wylt
ſaye / we truſte in the lorde ower God:
a ſuer truſte in dede to truſte in hym whoſe
highe places and alters Ezekias
hathe taken awaye commaundinge Iuda
and Ieruſalem to worſhipe befor this
alter. Be it in caſe (I praye the) that
I ſhulde geve the now (notwithſtandinge
thy bargayn made withe my Lorde

the kinge of Aſſyrye) two thouſand horſes
/ art thou able yet of thy ſelfe to mā
them? And howe is it then / that ſeinge
thou arte not able to abyde the violence
and power even but of one of the leſte
princes of my Lorde / yet not withſtandinge
/ wylte thou truſte to the horſe men
and chariets of the egypcions? Thinkeſt
thou that I of my nowne heade
am come vp hither to deſtroye this lande?
It was my Lorde that commaunded
me ſaynge. Go thy wayes vp to that
lande ād deſtroye it. Then ſpake Eliakim
/ Sobna / and Ioas vnto Rabſacen:
ſpeake vnto vs thy ſeruaunts (I praye
the) in the Syre tonge / for we vnderſtande
that languege / and ſpeke not
to vs in the Iwes languege leſte the people
nowe beinge at the walles heare.
Whome Rabſices anſwerde. Why / thinke
ye that my Lorde ſente me only to
yow and to your Lorde to ſaye this meſſage
/ and not rather to theſe kareful &
miſerable men that ſitte vpon the walls
that they ſhulde not be conſtrayned

to eate theire owne dyrte and to drynke
their owne piſſe with yow? Rabſace therfore
proceded ſtefly in his oracion kryinge
with a lowde voyce in the Iuwes
tonge ſaing / heare what the grete king
the Kinge of the Aſſyrions commaundeth.
Thus cōmaundeth the kinge / take
hede leſte kinge Ezekias deceyue yowe
/ for it lieth not in his power to defende
yowe / Nether let hym perſuade yow
to truſte in his lorde / affirminge that y•
Lorde with oute doute wyl delyuer you
and that this cyte ſhal not be delyuerde
into the handes of the kinge of Aſſyrye:
ſe that ye obaye not Ezekie / for thus
promyſeth yow the kynge of Aſſyrie
If ye wyll beare me ſo myche favoure
as to forſake hym and turne to me / every
man ſhal enioye ſtyll his owne vyneyarde
his fygge trees / and euery man
ſhal drinke the waters of his owne pytte
vntyl I ſhal come and leade yow vll
to a lande as good as is this yowers / even
a lande wheryn is plentye bothe o
whete and wyne: ye / a lande al redy ſowne

withe al maner corne and planted
with ye beſte vynes. Take good hede yt
Ezekias deceyve yowe not ſaynge / the
Lorde ſhal delyver yow. For / haue therever
yet eny of the goddis of the gentiles
delyuerd their lande frome the powr
of the kinge of the Aſſyrians? Where is
nowe the God of Hemath ād Arphad?
Wher is the god of Sepharuaim? And
who (I praye yowe) delyuerde Samaria
fro my power? Whiche on emonge all
the goddes of theſe kingdomes hath delyverde
their region from my power / ſo
that ye maye truſte to the lorde to delyver
Ieruſalem from my hande? At theſe
wordes the kinges legates wer ſo put
to ſylence that they had not a worde to
anſwere. Then returned Eliakim the
preſydent of ye towne houſe ſonne of Helkie
/ Sobna the ſcrybe / and Ioas Secreterye
the ſonne of Aſaph vnto Ezekias
their clothes alto cutte / and tolde hī
the oracion of Rabſacen.
            
            
               The .xxxvij. Chapiter.
               
               
                  THen kinge Ezekias hearing this
/ cut his clothes: and he clothed
with ſacke wente into the temple
of the Lorde: and in the meane tyme
he ſente Eliakim the preſident of ye
towne / Sobnam the ſcribe and the ſeniours
of the preeſtes clothed with ſacke
vnto Iſaye the prophete ſonne of Amos
whiche ſayed vnto hym. Thus commaundeth
vs Ezekias to ſaye vnto
the. The daye of tribulacion / the daye
of affliccion and blaſphemye is nowe come
even lyke as thoughe the tyme of
delyueraunce of chylde were preſente / and
ſtrengthe to put it forth ſhulde fayle
the mother. Verely the Lorde thy
god hath harde the wordes of Rabſace / whome
his Lorde the Kinge of Aſſyrye
hathe ſente to blaſpheme and to revyſe
the lyuinge god with certayne wordes
which the lorde thy god hath harde / wherfore
thou muſte geve the to prayr for
y• reamnaunte which ar yet left a lyue
Then Iſaye anſwerd ye ſeruāts of kīge
Ezekie thꝰſente & comen on this maner

Thus ſhall ye tell yower lorde. Thus
ſaith the lorde. Feare thou not for theſe
wordes which thou haſt harde / in y• which
the ſeruants of the kinge of Aſſyrye
haue thus revyled and blaſphemed
me / for lo / I ſhall ſende vpon him but a
blaſte of wynde / whoſe noyſe as ſone as
he heareth he ſhal returne into his owne
lande / where I ſhall cauſe him to be
ſlayne with ſwerde. Nowe was Rabſaces
returned and fownde the kinge of
Aſſyrye making warre agenſt Lobnam
(for he had knowledge that he was remoued
from Lachis and it was reported
alſo of Tharhaca kinge of the Ethiops
yt he ſhuldbe nowe cōe to make warre
with him) which meſſage when the
kinge of Aſſyrye harde / anon he ſente other
ābaſſiatours to Ezekias with this
commaundement. Thus ſhal ye tell
Ezekias kinge of Iuda. Take hede thy
god deceyue the not in whom thou truſteſte
promyſinge the that Ieruſalē ſhal
not be delyuerd into the hands of the
kinge of the Aſſyryons. For thou haſt

harde what great actes the kinge of Aſſyry
hath done to al kingdomes in ſubuertinge
them / ād dareſt thou haue yet
eny hope to eſcape? Did the goddis of y•
Gentyles delyuer them whom my prediceſſours
haue cōquered? Coulde thei
delyuer Gozan / Haran / Rezeph / and
the Chyldern of Eden / whiche holde of
Thalaſſar? where is the kinge of Hamath
/ kinge of Arphad / kinge of Sepharuaim
/ Hene and Aue? Then toke kinge
Ezekias the Pyſtel of the handes of
the Ambaſſiatours / & when he had red
it / he wente vp into the houſe of the lorde
/ and opened it before the lorde makīge
his prayer on thys maner. O lorde of powers
/ the God of Iſrael / which dwelleſt
at the Cherubyms:thou arte ye God
which is the only god / even the god of al
the kingdoms of the erthe / for it is thou
that haſte made bothe heauen ād erthe.
Bowe downe thy eare lorde and lyſten
opene thy eyes ād beholde / Conſyder al
the wordes of Senherib which hath ſente
hither a blaſphemous meſſage / wheryn

he curſeth and blaſphemeth the lyuinge
god. Verely (lorde) I knowe this
to be trwe / that the kinges / of Aſſyrye
haue conquered all tye kingdoms and
regions of the other nacions / & that they
caſted their goddes into the fyer / for
theſe were no goddis but the workes of
mennis handes made of tre and ſtone / wherfore
they haue deſtroyed them worthely.
But nowe (lorde owr god) nowe
ſaue vs frome the handes of Senherib
that nowe al the kingdoms of the erthe
might knowe that thou art the lorde a
lone. When the thinge was at this poynte
/ Iſaye the ſonne of Amos ſente ād
tolde Ezekias theſe wordes. Thus hath
the Lorde God of Iſrael ſpoken vnto
theſe thinges which thou in thy prayer
aſkedſte of me as concerninge the kinge
of the Aſſyryōs. Thꝰ anſwerth the lorde
agenſt him. O virgyn and daughter
of Zion / the kinge of Aſſyrye hathe
deſpyſed ād ſcorned the / he ſhoke his head
aftyr the o daughter of Ieruſalē: but
thow proude kynge / whō revileſt thou?

whom curſeſte and blaſphemeſte thou?
Agenſte whom kroweſt thou or lyfteſt
vp thy ſtately loke? verely euen agenſt
him that ſanctifieth Iſrael. For (thy ſeruants
ſente hither) thou reuyledſt the
lorde and haſt taken ſo ſtoughtly vpon
thy ſelfe this thinge ſayng / I ſhal kouer
the moſte higheſt mountayns ād ſydes
of Libani with the multitude of my
horſe men and chariets / I ſhal cutdowne
hir highe Ceder trees & hir beſte fyr
trees. I ſhal entre thorowe both hir highe
mountayns and alſo hyr wodes ād
fayer feldes. And where I fynde waters
I ſhal drye them al vp with the fete
of my hoſte. Speakeſt thow not now
euen thus to kinge Ezekias? ſaīge / haſt
thou not harde what actes and by what
power I haue done them in tyme paſte
and what I am abonte to do now alſo?
that is to wete / that I am aboute to
ſubuerte thy cytes be they neuerſo ſtronge
and to bringe thez into heapes of ſtones
ād into ruyne / whoſe inhabitours
ſhal quake for feare lyke handleſſe men

beinge confounded / for they ſhalbe lyke
the graſſe of the felde which nowe is grene
and a nō is it thek for houſes / ye which
often tymes is withred before it be
rype. But I know I knowe (ſaith y• lorde)
thy conuerſacion / I knowe thy ſettinge
forth and thy returninge / ye I knowe
thy furyouſe rebellinge agenſt me
For this therfore thy haſty conſpyriſon
agenſte me and for thy pryde which al I
wel knowe / I ſhal put a brydle vpon thy
noſe and ſhal ſet a ſnaffle vpon thy
lyppes where with I ſhal plucke y• backe
agene by the ſame waye thou camſte
But (o Ezekias) this token ſhal I geue
y• / this yeare ſhalt thou eate ſiche as ye
haue in ſtore / the nexte yeare ſhal ye eate
ſiche as ſhal growe of their ſelfe with
oute tillinge or ſowinge / but the thirde
yeare ye ſhall both ſowe ād reape for ye

And then thei ſhal come agene togither
which eſcaped beinge of the houſe of Iuda

highe. For oute of Ieruſalē ſhal cōe

Aſſyrie departed ād wente his waye frō

this / it chaunced on a tyme yt as he worſhiped
his god in the houſe of Niſroch:
Adrameſech ād Sarezer his ſonnes ſmit

               The .xxxviij. Chapiter
               
                  NOt lōge before theſe thīges were
in doinge / Ezekias was ſore
ſyke and lykely to haue dyed
and then came there vnto him Iſaye y•
prophete the ſonne of Amoz / & ſayd vnto
him. Thus ſayth the lorde. Set an
ordyr in thy houſe / for thou ſhalt dyeād
not lyue. Then Ezekias turned his face
to the walle and made his prayer to y•
lorde ſaynge: Remembyr lorde (I beſeche
the) how I haue walked before the intrwe
faithe / with ꝑfit harte doinge thy
pleſures. And thus ſaynge Ezekias wepte
ſore / Then ſpake the lorde to Iſaye
on this maner. Go thy wayes and tell
Ezekias. Thꝰ ſayth the lorde / the god
of thy father Dauid. I haue harde thy

prayer / I haue ſene thy teares: wherfore
lo / I adde yet vnto thy lyfe .xv. yeares
alſo I ſhal delyuer the and this cyte which
I defende frome the handes of the
kinge of the Aſſyrions. And this token
ſhalbe geuen y• of the lorde that he will
performe his promyſe. Beholde / I ſhall
bringe backe the ſhadue of the dyall which
ſhadne is now deſcended withe the
ſonne aryſinge in Ahazdy all and ſhall
turne it vp agene .x. howers: then turned
backe the ſonne the ſame .x. degrees
aſcending agene by the which the ſhadue
had deſcended before. The thākesgeuinge
which Ezekias kīge of Iuda write
aftyr he had bene ſycke & was nowe
rekouerd frome his ſore. I had wente yt
I ſhulde haue gone to my graue in my
beſte dayes / when I moſte deſyerde the
reſydue of my age. I ſayd with my ſelfe
I ſhal no more apere before ye lorde god
in this lyfe. I ſhal nomore be cōuerſante
with the mortal men but ſhalbe with
ye baneſſhed cyteſens. My dayes are
foldenvp and taken awaye fro me lyke

an herdemannis tente. My lyfe is kutof
lyke y• weauers webbe: whylys I prouyded
to lyue he kut me of. He made an
ende of me on a daye / I truſted at the leſte
to haue lyued vnto the morowe / but
he alto broke my bones lyke a lyon / and
made an ende of me on a daye. Then chattred
I lyke a ſwalowe / and murmured
lyke a Crayne / I moorned lyke a dove
/ lyftīge vp my eyes vnto y• highe god
ſaynge. Lorde I am ſore handled / delyuer
me vpon thy worde. What myght I
thīke or what might I ſaye that he wolde
do this miche for me? That I mought
yet ꝑuſe al my dayes / ye although it
be to my bytter payne. For I knowe verely
(lorde) yt this lyfe is ſaulſed with
galle / and that my lyfe is ſubiecte to all
bitter myſerye. I knowe that thou makeſt
me heuye of ſleape / & wakeneſt me
agene. But lo / yet ſhal I thīke that thou
doſte me grete pleſure if thou graunteſt
me theſe kareful bitterneſſes. Here
thou ſtayeſt my lyfe that it ꝑeſſhed not
whiles thou caſtedſte al my ſynnes behynde

thy backe. For nether men layed
in their graues prayſe the / nor yet y•
deade loaue the / nor they that deſcende
into their graues abyde for thy faithfulnes.
But it is the lyuīge man / it is the
lyuinge (I ſaye) that prayſeth the / euen
as I do nowe this daye. For the fathers
laye forth thy faithfulnes vnto theire
chylderne. Sane vs (lorde) and we ſhal
ſynge ower pſalmes / all the dayes of ower

commaunded Iſaye ſayng / take the plaſter
and laye it vpon his botche ād he
ſhal amende. And then ſayed Ezekias.
Oh what a meruelouſe thinge is this
that I ſhal yet aſcēde into the houſe of

               The .xxxix Chapiter

he had harde how that he was ſycke &

ſyluer and golde / of his riche ſpyces / ād

his fyned oyles ād his preciouſe oyntments

               There was nothinge that Ezekie had
other in his houſe / or thorowte al his realme

Iſaye y• prophete vnto kīge Ezekias
ſayng to him. What ſaye theſe men / or
frō whenſe ar they comē vnto y•? Ezekias
anſwerde him ſayng / they arcomon

And Iſaye ſayd / what haue they
ſene in thy houſe? Ezekias anſwerde / al
yt I haue in my houſe haue they ſene / I
haue ſhewed them alſo all my treſure.
               Then ſayd Iſaye to Ezekias / heare the
worde of y• lorde of powers. Beholde / y•

Ezekias vnto Iſaye. The lorde turne it

For a non as he hath blowne vpon

It was I that broughte the frome
