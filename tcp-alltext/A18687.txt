For he that admynyſtreth or receyueth ony ſacrament he ought to be in the ſtate of grace / & that is as vnto the mynyſters of that ſacrament. Alſo it is to knowe that euery creature erthely not baptyſed is bounde to receyue that ſacrament as it is ſayd in place & tyme. But otherwyſe was this oblygacyon accomplyſſhed at the begynnynge man was not baptyſed but in the vigyll of Eeſter & of Whytſontyde / & they that dewely were cathecuminus: that is to ſaye inſtructe of the artycles of the fayth & of that / yt they ought to vowe or promytte But after by the inſpyracyon of the holy gooſt it

was ordeyned that theſe childern forthwith after yt they were borne ſholde be baptyſed. For in them is no thynge that may lette the effecte of that ſacramēt / as ſholde be mortall ſȳne actuel or fiction And that procedeth of the mercy & Juſtyce dyuyne For ſo as two perſones that is to knowe Adam & Eue vs bynde all by lawe comonly to ſynne and dampnacyon wtout our gylte actuell.

               ¶ Here foloweth the maner to conferme the holy baptem in the artycle of neceſſyte.
               Of the maner to conferme the ſacrament ofCapitulū. ij. baptem in the caas of neceſſyte. That is to knowe that yf a woman or other ſymple perſone baptyſe he ought to take hede vnto ye mater of the ſacrament vnto the forme of the wordes and vnto the intencyon. Fyrſt vnto ye mater. For that ought to be water naturell. For man may not be baptyſed with wyne / with ſydre / with blood / with mylke with vryne / with water of roſes / or other water dyſtylled / but man ſhal be baptyſed in neceſſyte with lye / and with water in the whiche man ſhall haue ſmarte in the fleſſhe. And it is holy thynge & good coūſeyll that a man haue holy water in his houſe For yf it were wel poſſyble man ſholde not be baptyſed

with other water. Alſo it is to aduyſe ſymple people that yf there apere ony membre of the childe in the whiche men knoweth lyf & of the whiche he fereth the deth before that it be borne ꝑfectly he it ſholde baptyſe in that membre the whiche apereth. Alſo yf the moder paſſe this lyf before the natyuyte of the childe ye whiche a man byleueth truly lyf in her / he ought haſtely to gaffe her mouth / & after dyſcretly open the bely of the woman & baptyſe the lytell childe yf it be foūde on lyue / yf it be founde deed it ought not to be buryed within the holy groūde / yf the moder hath not ben ſlayne & put to deth for the loue of god or for the trouth of the fayth. For in ſuche caas may doctours holde yt ye childe ſholde be martyr. For it is more to fere & toNota. playne where a childe deyeth without the receyuynge the ſacrament of baptem then it doth of the deſtruccyon & the fallynge in to depnes of all ye to wnes caſtelles / & cytees of the worlde. In the whiche apereth the grete ſynne / & the grete blame of thoſe the whiche them gouerne ylle in this mater what ſo euer maner it be in. As vnto the forme that is thoſe wordes the whiche he ought to ſaye / he behoueth to take hede vnto theym that be ordeyned of god & of holy chirche as well in caas of neceſſyte as of ſolempnyte. That is to knowe Ego baptiſote In nomīe patris et filij et ſpiritus ſancti amen.De forma baptiſmi. And in englyſſhe. I baptyſe the in the name of the fader & of the ſone & of the holy gooſt. Or in other langage or wordes betokenynge the ſame ſentence For one may baptyſe in all maner of langages / 

And it behoueth that the wordes & the doynge that is to put the water vpon the childe be holy in ony wyſe togyder. That is to ſaye that before that he hath ſayd all theſe wordes he haue begonne to put the water or before that he hath endeth to put the water he begynne the wordes / for otherwyſe there is no baptyme. That is to knowe yf a man ſaye all theſe wordes & after put the water or fyrſt endeth to put the water & after ſayth theſe wordes. As to the entencyon / that is to knowe that at theDe intentione. leſt that perſone the whiche baptyſeth ought to haue intencyon to do that / that our moder the holy chirche intendeth & cōmaūdeth to do & it may ſuffyſe ſuche generall intencyon / ſo that he byleueth the ſame or haue in his intencyon yt the ſacramēt of baptem purefyeth man from all ſynne or tha

                   theſe wordes afore ſayd ſuffyſe. That is I baptyſe the in the name of the fader & of the ſone & of the holy gooſt / that he ſaye not with that & of our lady & of ſaynt Johan or of thynge lyke he hath not than baptym / for the intencyon the whiche is of neceſſyte of the ſacramēt is not good nor ryghtfull. Of other caſes & diffycultees the whiche be in this mater ſholde theſe curates & prechers ſomtyme ſhewe in publyſſhynge for theſe dyuers & pyteous caſes the whiche by Ignoraunce may come in many places of cryſtendome.

The thyrde is in auaūtynge hymſelf to haue ye goodes ſpyrytuell or temporell the whiche man hath not / as yf it were to haue connynge vertue or deuocyon. And in ſo doynge / it is arrogance / iactance / & ypocreſye as vnto regarde of the goodes ſpyrytuell / and vayne glorye as vnto the regarde of the goodes outwarde As be the goodes of fortune.

For ſoo as theſe doctours ſayen / the thynge that ony man loued ſoueraynly / that thynge is his god. By the whiche it appyreth that the ydolatrye of theſe euyll cryſten men prowde men / couytous

men / and lecherous men / is more to be dyſpyſed / than that of the paynems / and of ſarraſyns the whiche well conſyderen the hyghnes of the lawe of Jheſu cryſt / & the vnkyndnes of theſe euyll and vnfaythfull cryſten men. Take hede than the ſynner that wyll examen his conſcyence in the whiche is pryncypally his loue / his thought & his deſyres / and yf he fynde that there be ony thynge worldely accuſe hym as a fals traytour vnkynde and an ydolatrer.

For as ſaynt Gregory ſayth / there may not come ylle of payne in this worlde as ben theſe thynges aboueſayd / where as it is by the wyll and ordynaunce of god. Now it is ſoo that of the ordynaunce and Jugement of god may no thynge procede but that it be good & well done. By the whiche it appyreth that who ſo meruayled dyſordynatly of a thynge well done / is none other thynge than to contrary & to take god & his operacyons / ordenaūces & Jugementes / the whiche thynge is blaſfemynge horryble & deteſtable. Here than ought the perſone to take hede of the ſynne of murmuracōn / of impacyence / & of dyſpayre.

Alſo yf he be areſted in ony dremes in byleuynge that for the dyuerſyte of dremes to hym ſhal come Ioye or deſolacyon. Alſo yf he put truſt vnto theſe bokes reproued / as is the ſcyence the whiche is called of the arte inuocatoria or other / in theſe thynges there may be mortall ſynne after the qualyte of the perſone & the malyce of the caas & in other dyuers maners the whiche ſholde be to longe for to telle / as theſe doctours them diſtyncten & determen Alſo here the perſone ought to take hede yf he haue made ony vowes the whiche by forgetfulnes / by neclygence or by malyce he hath treſpaſſed. Alſo yf he hath made a vowe a thynge vnlefull to do / or in lettynge of more gretter good / as woman ye make vowes not to kembe them / or not to waſſhe them / or not to ſpynne on ſome dayes / the whiche ben grete ſuperſtycyons & folyſſhe. And it is to be noted that theſe byſſhoppes / or thoſe vnto whome they haue gyuen auctoryte may chaūge the vowes of theyr ſubgectes for ſome good cauſes & reaſonable. Excepte the vowe of chaſtyte / of relygyon / of of pylgremage vnto ſaynt Iames / of Rome / & of Iheruſalem / the whiche vowes aperteyne all oonly vnto the puyſſaunce apoſtolycall with other yf it pleaſe hym them to retayne. Alſo it is to be noted that as oftentymes as the perſone breketh his vowe without Iuſte & reſonable cauſe as oftentymes he ſynned mortally. An example / who ſo had auowedNota. chaſtyte / & after maryed with intencyon to accomplyſſhe the werkes of maryage ſynned mortally in maryenge hym. Alſo the fyrſte tyme that he accomplyſſed the dede of maryage he ſynned mortally

This ſynne hath .vi. braunches as declared ſaynt Gregory in the .xxxi. boke of his moralles / that is to knowe malyce / rancoure / dyſpayre / puſillanimyte / vnclennes / & euagacyon of thoughtes Malyce is taken here for a maner of ymagynacyon of ylle ayen theſe holy perſones the whiche warned theſe ſlouthfull people to do well / & they it diſdayne in theyr courage. Rancoure is to ſhewe ſuche indygnacyon by ſome taken outwarde. Puſillanimyte is to flee the werke of coūſell & of perfeccyon or fere to take laborous werkes. Vnclennes is a ſlouth & lachoſnes to accomplyſſhe the cōmaū
                  dementes of god. Euagacion of thought is to gyue & occupye hymſelf with talkynges in folyſſhe & vayne langage / & to brynge hymſelfe here & there vnprofytably or to chaūge his courage from one thynge vnto an other. Dyſpayre is ſomtyme ſynne ayen ye holy gooſt / wherof there are .vi. maners contraryous vnto the .vi. operacyons the whiche the holy gooſt maketh in the ſoule the whiche is in the eſtate of grace. The fyrſt operacyon is that he gyued hope of the mercy of god / & ayen that grace is proprely dyſpayre as it was in Cayn & in Judas. And thatt cometh whan the perſone byleueth & holdeth that for penaunce / or for prayer that he doth / god wyll not pardon hym / the whiche thynge is ayen ye infynyte bonte & mercy of god. The ſeconde operacyon of the holy gooſt / is to gyue an

holy fere of god in the ſoule. And ayen that grace is preſumpcyon the whiche is in ſuche wyſe to preſume of the mercy of god that ye perſone deſpyſed & myſtaked his Juſtyce / as ben a maner of ſynners dulled the whiche anſwere vnto them that them repreuen that god hath not made them / for to haue them loſt. The thyrde operacyon of the holy gooſt is to gyue & teche the holy trouth neceſſarye vnto ſaluacyon. And ayen that grace is impugnacyon of trouth the whiche is whan the perſone of certayne malyce ayen ſayth vnto the trouth of the fayth & of the cōmaūdementes in d

                  ytynge hym to proue the contrarye vnto the trouth. The fourth operacyon of the holy gooſt is to gyue ayde vnto the ſoule by grace dyuyne. And ayen that grace is a dyſpleaſure of ſpyrytuell goodnes & of the grace of his neyghbour in repugnynge by certayna malyce vnto the honour of god / and the vnyon of the membres of holy chirche. The fyfth operacyon is to gyue vnto the ſoule true correccyon of his ſynnes. And ayen that grace is obſtynacyon & purpoſe neuer to repente hym of his ſynne & he is named fynally impenytent. The ſixt operacyon of the holy gooſt is to haue a ferme purpoſe neuer to cōmytte thynge that is contrary vnto the honour & holy wyll of god. And ayen this grace is obſtinacyon & ferme purpoſe not to leue or departe hym from ye pleaſure that he hath in his ſynnes / as pryde / couetyſe / & lecherye. And it is to be noted that theſe .vi. maner of ſynnes beforſayd be ſayd inremyſſyble / but not in ſuche wyſe but that god may them well pardonne yf the ſynner wolde do penaunce. For

as ſaynt Auſtyn ſayth / there was neuer ſo grete a ſynner / but that he ought to haue hope of his ſaluacyon in as moche as god hym hath gyuen lyf. But they ben named inremyſſybles / for as moche that full fewe aryſen & with grete payne. And to ye entente that a man may lyghtly retorne & comprehende the .vi. graces of ye holy gooſt & the .vi. ſynnes contraryous they be reputed in ſuche forme. Dyſpayre ayen hope / preſumpcyon ayen the fere of god / impugnacyon of the trouth ayen the knowlege of ye trouth / dyſpleaſure of goodes ſpirytuell ayen ayde by the grace of god / beynge in purpoſe to do no penaūce ayen contrycyon of his ſynnes / beynge in purpoſe alwayes to contynue in ſynne / ayen ye purpoſe to abſteyne hym. And this is ſhortely as vnto the thyrde cōmaūdement.

Prudence & force ben for to eſhewe yre &Prudencia. enuye. Prudence & attemperance for to eſhewe glotony & lechery. Prudence & Juſtyce for to eſhewe couetyſe. Prudence is a moche noble vertue the whiche dyſcerned bytwene good & ylle / and the grete with the lytell / and the lytell ylle with the gretter. By the whiche alſo a man cheſed the good & fleed the ylle. This vertue cheſed more ſooner the gretter good than the lytell / for as nothynge dyſcerned

Theſe lytell goodes ben they of this worlde. The grete ben they of the ſoule. And the ſouerayne ben they of glorye. They than the whiche haue prudence in the lyght of charyte cheſen the goodes of the ſoule / as ben theſe noble & merytoryous vertues / by the whiche they come vnto ſouerayne goodes in glorye. But prudence carnall & worldely and deuylleſſhe cheſed the lytell goodes of this worlde / & leſed the ſouerayne / & is brought vnto ſouerayne ylle of helle. Juſtyce is a noble vertue by the whiche a man gyuedJuſticia. vnto euery man that that is his. That is to knowe in generall / vnto god obedyence / vnto his neyghbour innocence / vnto hymſelf clennes of conſcyence. Innocence is to do nothynge vnto his neyghbour that he wolde not vnto hymſelf to be done In lyke wyſe as by Juſtyce a man doth well & pleſure vnto his neyghbour / by innocence a man kepeth hym from offendynge hym. Force is an otherFortitudo. vertue by the whiche a man vndertaketh to do or ſuffre for the loue of god theſe thynges ſtronge & harde. As yf it ſholde be to do grete penaūce to entre in to relygyon / to pardonne grete offences / to ouercome his propre inclynacyons / to ſuffre Iniuryes & paſſyons. Attemperaūce is a noble vertue y•

The thynge cōmaunded is charytably to ſocoure our neyghbour in kepynge hym vnto our power in place and in tyme that he renne not or falle not in ony of the foure maner of dethes the whiche folowen. For as for to come vnto ſaluacyon it is not all oonly requyred neyther to ſlee / bete / kylle / or do ony other dyſpleaſure vnto his neyghbour / but it behoueth of neceſſyte of the cōmaūdement of god to do vnto hym pleaſure in tyme & in place in preſeruynge his lyfe / & in defendynge hym from the deth.

Ayenſt this cōmaūdement doo they the whiche by theyr couytouſnes put them in warre / for they haue noo good & ryghtfull intencyon. Alſo the people of the chirche be not of condycyon that they ſholde excercyſe mortall warre / & to make effuſyon of humayne blood. For in ſo doynge they ſholde be irreguler & indygne of ye ſaerament

And vnto that it is trewely ſayd that he hath more gretter payne for to be helyd of the wounde of the tonge than of the ſtroke of ſworde. And this ſuffyſed as now of the ſynne of enuye.

By this vertue of attemperaunce the creature reaſonable kepeth hym from to moche drynke and from to moche meete / and alſo from all dyſordynaunce ſenſuall touchynge the ſynne of lecherye.

Fyrſte in etynge at an houre not dewe without appetyte before that the meetes taken ben dygeſted / wherof cometh many ſykneſſes the whiche greuen the body and the ſoule. Secondely by to moche grete deſyre for to haue bought precyous meetes the whiche ſome tyme perteyneth not vnto the eſtate of the perſone. For for to make dyſpence in meetes the whiche appertaynen not vnto the perſone is a greuous ſynne. Thyrdely for to ete to haboundauntly by the whiche nature is greued / the whiche is conſent with a lytell and complayneth hym of to moche. Fourthly not kepyynge honeſt maner as for to ete to haſtely / the whiche thynge is called deuourynge. And fyfthtly in the maner of the preparacyon of meetes with to moche grete herte / of ſaltes / of ſpyceryes / of decoccyons / and of confectures. Of that ſynne comen many curſyd bowes or braunches after ſaynt Gregory. That is to knowe gladnes dyſordynat /

Dronkennes may come in thre maners without ſynne / with venyall / and without mortall. An example of the fyrſte. Some perſone knoweth not the vertue of the wyne and hath grete thorſte and drynked after his thorſte / it may be that he ſhall be dronke. Secondely. I put caas that the perſone knoweth the ſtrength of of the wyne / how be it he weneth not yt it hym ſholde ſurmoūte / for that he hath not ben acuſtomed / and it may be venyall ſynne all oonly Thyrdely it may happen that ſome knowen the myght of the wyne & by experyence of ye incōuenyent & yt he is acuſtomed to be dronken / but he loued better to obeye vnto his apetyte dyſordynatly than to kepe hym from the inconuenyences / and than he ſynned mortally. For vnto his wyttynge he it proued of vſage of reaſon & greued his body & his ſoule / & hym dyſpoſed to all ylle / in lyke wyſe as a true ſobre & abſtynet dyſpoſed hym vnto the grace of god & vnto the clerenes of ye intendement.

But the dyſcrete confeſſour may well from the lytell vnto the more grete after the qualyte & circūſtaunces of the ſynner come vnto the knowloge of the caas / & after to ſhewe vnto the ſynner the horryblenes of ye ſynne the whiche is ſo grete that he ought to be punyſſhed after the lawes for to brenne in the fyre / for as moche as this ſynne cryed afore god vengeaūce for of that cometh hongres / warres / mortalytees / 

peſtylences / & perdycyons of reames as wytneſſeth theſe holy ſcryptures. By this ſynne pryncypally was the dyluuye in the tyme of Noe / & all the worlde deyed except. viij. perſones. Alſo for theſe ſame ſynnes felle in to depnes Sodome and Gomorre & thre other Cytees. And now of late ben as many of ylles comen / and cometh / & ſhall come that no man them may wryte or nombre. It happened alſo as wytneſſeth ſaynt Gregorye / that the lecherous perſone leſeth the clerenes & lyght of vnderſtandynge / & ſo he is without conſtaunce / without conſyderacyon takynge / without true hope of the delytes of paradyſe / and in one affeccyon & loue dyſordynate of this preſent worlde / & of hymſelf / for alwayes he wolde lyue in the ſtenche of his ſynne. By the whiche it happeneth often that ſuche lecherous people dyſpayre them whan the houre cometh of theyr departynge / & ſo they goo vnto the deth eternall. And this is as vnto the ſynne of lecherye & for this the .vi. cōmaūdement.
            
            
               ¶ Here foloweth the .vij. cōmaundement the whiche is ſuche.
               THou ſhalt do no theeft. In this cōmaundement
                     Caplm .xi. vnto vs is ſome thynge cōmaunded / and the other defended. The thynge cōmaunded is charytable prudence in the lyght of charyte / by the whiche we haue conſyderacyon of the greate dyfference the whiche is bytwene the goodes erthely and the goodes of glorye. By this dyfferece and knowlege we dyſprayſe and repute as nought all

felycyte worldely in comparyſon of the very bleſſydnes. And in lyke wyſe by this conſyderacyon we ben enclyned & induced to do Juſtyce the whiche is none other thynge as now / but for to yelde vnto euery man that that vnto hym apperteyneth as it hath ben ſayd before & ſhall be more playnly in ſpekynge of reſtytucyon. The thynge the whiche is defended by the cōmaūdement is the ſynneDe auaricia. of couetyſe. Couetyſe is an appetyte dyſordynate of goodes tranſytorye & temporall what ſoo euer they be. This ſynne is cōmytted generally in thre maners / yt is to knowe in gettynge to moche brennyngly / in retaynynge to ſtreytely & in dyſpendynge to ſcarſely. And for as moche ſayth ſaynt Poule that the coueytous man is an ydolater & a ſeruytour of the deuyll. Wherfore it is to be noted that a deuyll named Māmona made vnto the coueytous man. vi. cōmaūdementes. The fyrſt is that he kepe well his golde & his ſyluer or other goodes. The ſeconde is that he leſe not in his handes. The thyrde is that he encreaſe them from daye to daye The fourth is that he gyue no thynge in almeſſe nor other wyſe. The fyfth is that he lene not nor doo noo pleaſure / for in ſoo doynge he putteth his goodes in peryll. The ſixte is that he ſhall reſtrayne hymſelf & his houſholde from meete & drynke for to ſpare his goodes. Of this ſynne cometh & procedeth ſeuen doughters or braunches after as ſayth ſaynt Gregorye. That is for to vnderſtande treaſon / fraude / begylynge / periurynges / rauayne / deſyrous for to gete / hardynes of body ayenſt the poore and many other euylles. Here is defended

all euyll marchaundyſe / euyll laborynges and werkes to fayne hym in his Journey / and to ſelle fals ware for good. I put caas that the ſeller hath ben dyſceyued in byenge them for good / for one dyſceyued ought not an other for to dyſceyue. Here is defended theeft / vſery / rauayne / ſymony / ſacrylege / fals ſpekynge / fals ſwerynge / and generally all decepcyons openly or pryuely / by the whiche a man maketh the loſſe of an other his owne or els that a man wolde not reaſonably vnto hym to be done. Alſo all contractes and other thynges in the whiche it behoueth▪ For to make reſtytucyon of the whiche ſhall be treated in partyculer in the fourth partye. And this is in generall and in ſhort as vnto the .vij. cōmaundement.
            
            
               ¶ Here foloweth the .viij. cōmaundement the whiche is ſuche.
               THou ſhalt bere no fals wytnes. In this cō
                  maundement
                     Caplm .xij. vnto vs is ſome thynge commaunded / and the other defended. The thynge whiche is cōmaunded is the contrarye and the oppoſyte of that the whiche is defended. To bere falſe and curſyd langage is contrarye vnto charyte / the whiche we ſholde haue ayenſt our neyghbours By the whiche it appyreth that it vnto vs is commaunded to ſaye well to magnyfye and to exalte the good and the honour of our neyghbours and in prayſynge god charytably in place and in tyme / the whiche thynge we accomplyſſhe by the vertue of prudence & of force illumyned with charyte / 

for ſo doynge & deſyrynge the good & honour of our neyghbour to be our honour / in lyke wyſe as requyreth the vertue & nature of charyte / the whiche is to loue his neyhbour as hymſelf / & the whiche maketh all goodes to be comyn. Than by good prudence we ſhall exalte & augment our welth & our neyghboures. And by that vertue of force we hym ſholde purchaſe good and honour in berynge hym good wytnes in place & in tyme & in defendynge hym to our power & his good renowne. And this is in ſhort as vnto ye thynge cōmaūded. The thynge defended / is fals wytnes. That is to ſaye curſyd langage procedynge of Ire & of enuye / & in lyke wyſe as Ire & enuye ben defended in the .vi. cōmaūdement pryncypally in as moche as the ſhewe them by werke / in lyke wyſe they ben defended in the .viij. in as moche as they it ſhewen by curſyd langage. For as a man may noye his his neyghbour in dede / in lykewyſe a man may noye hym in worde. And they that may not of dede oftentymes they do it by curſyd langage / ye whiche is cōmytte in dyuers maners. For as ſayen theſe doctours & the holy ſcryptures in the operacyon of the tonge is the deth or the lyf. And therfore wolde the bleſſydIn manibꝰ lingue more & vita. holy gooſt hym ſhewe & appyre in the lykenes of tonges of fyre for to gyue vnderſtandynge that yf the tonge be not purged and gouerned of the holy gooſt / it is an harde thynge but that it be gouerned of a curſyd ſpyryte. That is the deuyll the whiche by the meane of the tonge ſerpentynouſly putteth all humayne lynage vnto perdycyon / and the whiche gouerneth and ledeth theym that ben

               AS wel for theſe thynges ſpoken as for theſe
                     Caplm. xvij. thynges the whiche folowen is well for to be noted that holy chirche is compryſed in two eſtates. That is to knowe in the lyf actyf and in

the lyf contemplatyf the whiche vnto vs ben well ſygnyfyed by two women the doughters of one fader & of one moder / that is Martha and Mary mawdelayne dwellynge in one houſe the whiche choſe our bleſſyd ſauyour Jheſu cryſte for to lodge there and enhabyte. The lyfe actyfe is the lyfe as of them that ben worldely the whiche vnto vs is ſygnyfyed by Martha / the whiche was deſyrous to lodge our lorde and his apoſtles / and to aparell them and to gyue them refeccyon in betokenynge that they of the lyfe actyfe ought for to excercyſe them in the werkes of mercy corporall. The lyfe contemplatyf is the lyf of holy relygyon / and that vnto vs is ſygnyfyed by Mary mawdelayne the ſyſter of Martha / the whiche was at the feet of our lorde herkenynge ryght ſwetely the ryght holy doctryne of our lorde the whiche is the brede and the refeccyon of the ſoule. By the whiche it appyreth that the lyf contemplatyf excedeth in valour and in dygnyte the lyfe actyfe / in as moche as the ſoule is more noble than the body / and the werkes of mercy ſpyrytuall ben more noble than theſe werkes corporall. For in lyke wyſe as the excercyſe and occupacyon of the actyfe is ayenſt the body. In lyke wyſe the occupacyon of the lyf contemplatyfe is pryncypally ayenſt theſe neceſſytees and for the prouffyte of the ſoule. But not withſtandymge that the lyfe contemplatyfe is more hygher and more noble / ſhe is not the leſſe peryllous. For as moche as the eſtate is more hygher / the falle or the defaute that a man there in may do is the more greuous. And therfore may a man

ſaye that euen in lyke wyſe as the ryche worldely man of the lyfe actyfe is in payne and in thought for to gette and to augmente goodes temporall▪ fyrſt for the neceſſyte of hymſelf and of his / and folowynge for to gyue and to departe vnto the pore in place and in tyme after good prudence and that is the commaundement of god vpon the payne of deedly ſynne / and by the conſequent vpon the payne of dampnacyon. In lyke wyſe the perſone relygyous and contemplatyfe conſyderynge his pouerte and indygence ſpyrytuall and other neceſſytees without nombre as well in hymſelfe as in his neyghbours enforced hym and laboured to ſocoure vnto the one and vnto the other / and of as moche as theſe dyuerſytees as well corporall as ſpyrytuall ben the more gretter / of as moche groweth the payne and the thought in y• ſoule of the trewe relygyous man charytable and contemplatyfe.

                     ••
                   reaſon is that yf we conſyder the innocence and the perfeccyon that we haue promyſed and vowed vnto holy baptem / the whiche we ſholde holde and kepe before god / as is his cōmaundement to loue hym with all our herte / with all our thought / and

with all our myght and vertues. Alſo our neyghbours as our ſelfe. And alſo that for to pleaſe our bleſſyd creatour we ſholde be annorned with all vertues / as is fayth / hope / charyte / humylyte / pacyence / obedyence / chaſtyte / and ſo of all other maner of vertues We fynde in a dyſtaunce / alſo as infynyte and in the depe dyche of vnkyndenes and of all imperfeccyn. The fourth reaſon is that yf we conſyder the grete graces and grete benefyces that god vnto vs hath done and doth contynually as well in generall as in partyculer / as well vnto the regarde of the body as of the ſoule. We ſee derely that we ben acountable ayenſt hym without our power hym to acquyte of as moche as he is a more gretter thynge and a more vaylable than we for whome he it is all gyueth the whiche thynge is infynyte. For he vnto vs hath gyuen his ymage and his ſemblaunce in our creacyon. God the fader vs gyueth his oonly and his ryght dere ſone naturall for our redempcyon. The whiche ſone vs gyueth his ryght holy fleſſhe / his ſwete herte / and his ryght precyous blood for a ryght dygne and ſpyrytuall refeccyon.

And in recompenſe of ſuche thynges all our dede is as no thynge in the whiche it appyreth wel the folyſſhe preſumpcyon of many peple the whiche wenen for to preuayle in grete thynges before god. The fyfth reaſon is that yf we conſyder more ouer and in partyculer the honour / the Joye / the

noblenes and the ryches of paradyſe / the whiche is without ende and without meaſure / as it is to ſee the bleſſyd trynyte thre perſones in one eſſence of dyuynyte. To ſee in lyke wyſe with our eyes corporell the ryght holy humanyte of our ſauyour Jheſus the whiche ſhall gyue vnto all his faythfull and gloryous choſen pleaſaunte lokes / enbraſynges and ſwete kyſſynges. To ſee alſo the ſwete virgyn Mary moder & quene of all choſen. To ſee alſo the gerarchyes heuenly and ordres of angelles. To ſee and vnderſtande the vnyon of all the court celeſtyall. And how by charyte he is taken & the parfyte goodnes and glorye of that one is the welth and the loue of that other / for euery man that loued his neyghbour as hymſelf hym enioyed of the glorye of his neyghbours as of his owne / By this conſyderacyon it appyreth clerely that that ony humayne creature may do for to come vnto ſuche a College and vnto ſuche honour is leſſe than nought. The ſixte reaſon is that we conſyder profundely the grete dyfferent of a ſoule the whiche is in the eſtate of grace / vnto yt the whiche is in deedly ſynne. We ſee that that one is the doughter of god by grace and by adopcyon enherytour of paradyſe / and the eſpouſe of Jheſu cryſte the temple of the holy gooſt / ſanctuary and the habytacle of all the bleſſyd trynyte / ryght fayre and ryght pleaſaunte enorned and enryched with noble vertues more bryghter and more ſhynynge ſpyrytually than euer may do the ſonne corporally But all the contrarye is it of the ſoule in mortall ſȳne for ſhe is ye doughter & ſeruytour by īuocacōn

of our goodly enemye the veſſell the ſtynkynge delytes & vanytees worldely / the temple of ydolatres deuylleſſhe / the fals and vnfaythfull rybande the whiche hath broken the fayth & the maryage bytwene her & the kynge of kynges Jheſus the ſone of god the fader for to ſubmytte her vnto the ſtynkynge lechery of ye meſell of deuyll angell apoſtat By the whiche ſhe is vyle / horryble ſtynkynge more than ony carayne as well before god as before all the ſayntes of paradyſe. By the whiche it appyreth that we ſholde moche enforce vs to ſeche ye one eſtate & to flee the other in as moche as they ben of dyfference. And in ſo doynge yf god gyue vs not ye grace / there is none the whiche worldely hym may thanke. The ſeuenth reaſon for to ſee and knowe our feblenes and lyfell valure / is in the conſyderacyon of the lyf and of the vertues of holy faders / apoſtelles / martyres / confeſſours / & virgyns. Who where not of yron / or of ſtele / no more than we be who haue reſyſte vnto the temptacyons of the deuyll / matted and vaynquyſſhed theyr bodyes by meruayllous penaunce and abſtynence / dyſprayſed the worlde / & ſuffred martyrdoms terryble all oonly to thynke / haue purchaſed merytes / the fere and loue of god / holdynge and kepynge the waye of all holynes ſome in aege of theyr tendre youth / as theſe bleſſyd virgyns ſayntes and martyrs.

And we the whiche haue theyr lyues by doctryne & example & ye lyght of myracles yt god hath done for to approue ye holynes of theyr lyues. And

that the whiche is more we haue theyr aydes & interceſſyons how be it vnto vs they ſpeke not. And notwithſtandynge all theſe thyngꝭ we ben laches. frowarde & brought lyghtly to falle & torne to impacyence / in to murmuracyon / in to vnhope / & in to dyſpayre.

The ſeconde correccion ye whiche is of the neceſſyte of true charyte apertayned not all oonly vnto the prelates of holy chirche / or vnto theſe lordes erthely / but with y• vnto all them vnto whome god cōmaūded to loue theyr neyghbours as them ſelf. And for as moche as euery man is boūde hym to repente & correcte of his owne propre ſynne / it foloweth yt he ye whiche is boūde to loue his neyghbour as hymſelf that he ought to do his power hȳ to correcte & amende / or elles there is not in hym true charyte / in lyke wyſe as god commaunded vpon payne of deedly ſynne. But it is well to be noted that after as ſayen theſe doctours of theologye ſix condycyons ben requyſyte before that a man ſynned mortally in not correctynge his neyghbour / of the whiche thre ben in the regarde of hym the whiche ought for to correcte / and theſe other thre ben in regarde of hym the whiche oughte for be corrected. The fyrſte is whan that he the whiche ought to corecte is certayne of ye ſynne of his neyghbour. for of ſȳnes ſecrete a man is not

bounde ſo ſtraytly. The ſeconde is that the correccyon be ſwete or pyteous ſyns yt it ought to procede of charyte. The thyrde is yt there is none other vnto whome it appertayned more couenably for to correcte. For yf an other do it / it ſhall acquyte ſuffycyently them the whiche elles had ben holden to correcte. The fyrſt condycyon of the partye of the ſynner is that he haue in hym ſuche dyſpoſycyon that a man may hope that for the correccyon he is the leſſe worth / as it may be a perſone dronken / a lecherous man / a man of grete turour or of obſtynate yt a man may not truſte correccōn / than a mā ought to dyfferre & abyde the place tyme & oportunyte to do it. For in ſuche caas ſuffyſed pyte charytable & good wyll. The ſeconde condycyon is where the ſynne of hym that a man ought to corecte is mortall / or that is may be very ſemblable. For as for venyall ſynne a man is not bounde to correcte vpon the payne of deedly ſynne. But is boūde all oonly for to counſeyll / and after good congruyte / and this gyueth well to vnderſtande the goſpell the whiche ſayth. Correcte thy neyghbour / and yf by thy correccyon he be conuerted thou haſt wonne hym. By the whiche it foloweth after as ſayth ſaynt Gregory / that the ſynne wherof he hath ben corrected was mortall. For for a lytell ſynne a man is not loſte and dampned. Alſo yf a man were bounde for to correcte euery defaute / or feblenes venyell the whiche contynually is in many / full fewe it ſholde ſauour / and yf it were not that the tranſgreſſyon of that commaundement were in euery dede of theyr conſcyence. The thyrde condycyon

that he there haue place tyme & oportunyte. Be it than ſo ſpoken and concluded. That who ſo euer knoweth ye mortall ſynne of his neyghbour & the peryll of his dampnacōn & hath place tyme & oportunyte for to correcte / & there is none other ye whiche dooth by oblygacyon or other wyſe / & it is very lyke yt yf he were correcte & ſo he hȳ ſholde amende.

And ryght often it happeneth that the deth taketh the ſynner / wherof he taketh no hede.

In the whyche it apperyth clerely the grace begylynge and decepcyon as well of the worlde as of the deuyll the whiche bryngeth a ſlepe the people in ſynne.

               HOr as moch as the practyſe and experyence without grete connynge ys ſomty me more prouff ytable than is the ſcyence without experyence. Here foloweth a ryght prouffytable inſygnemēt of the practyſe that the confeſſour ought to holde / as well for the ſaluacyon of his ſoule / as of them that he confeſſeth. Fyrſt he ought to knowlege and fele in hymſelf / that the excuſacyon of the offyce of the confeſſour may not be duely done nor accomplyſſhed / as vnto theffecte of the ſacrament y• whyche is to brynge agayne the ſynner from the eſtate of ſynne to ye grace of god / & from deth ſpyrytuall to lyfe ſpyrytuall / but alonely by the vertu & ayde of ye creatour where as it is ſo as for to iuſtefy theſe ſȳners it is not leſſe than ye creacyon of ye world / as it appereth before / By the whiche the confeſſoure ought well to examyne his conſcyence in requyrynge the ayde of the holy gooſt / For yf he were boūde from dedely ſynne he myght not vnto his ſaluacy on vnbynde the ſynner / yt he confeſſeth nor haue ye ayde / & knowlege the whiche vnto yt is neceſſary & in token of this thynge whan our lorde gaue vnto

Alſo it is ryght expedyent ſpecyally at this daye that whan theſe confeſſours haue the caſes the whyche with good cauſe were other tymes reſerued

vnto the prelates for the correccyon of ſynners. for with grete payne may a man make ony fruyte in confeſſyon for the dyuerſyte and habundaunce of grete and horryble ſynnes and of caſes the whiche of them cometh as well in olde / as in yonge / as wel for the ſentences of excomynȳg of reſtytucyons / of blaſfemynges of ydolatryes & of other caſes newe and in eſtymables the whiche neuer hath ben herde / or founde by ſcrypture / & the whiche ben at this daye founde and taken from ſynners by the ſynguler grace of god / and the meryte and good dylygence of confeſſours / and there ben foūde many ſȳners that neuer wolde conſent to be ſent vnto the prelates though that they ſholde be euer without confeſſyon ſo as many ſayen and affermen. By the whyche it is not to be vnderſtande / that / that the which other tymes hath ben ordayned for ye charyte / and ſaluacyon of ſoules / as ben the ſacramentes and ordenaūces of holy chirche / ought to be kept vnto the preiudyce of the ſaluacyon of ſynners the whyche thynges ſhall come whan the prelates the whyche haue to anſwere of dede ſpyrytuall of theyr ſubgectes they wyll not cōmytte theyr caſe and puyſſaunce in ſuche neceſſyte vnto chapelayns / wyſe & dyſcrete how be it that at this daye with grete payne there ben founde chapelayns ſuffycyent in all thynges vnto ſuche offyce by the which defaute many of the poore ſynners go vnto dampnacyon / Alſo ought the confeſſour ſubtylly aduyſe the qualyte the offence and other dyſpoſycyons of the ſynner / And then he ought to enquyre of the ſynnes of the whiche he may be culpable / and yf he perceyue that

For it vnto hym hath ben tolde in as moche as he is the vp care of god pryncypally / and not as vnto a man / Alſo he ought to declare of as moche that he hym confeſſeth the more playnly / and the more longfully / of as moche he ſhall loue hym the better. Alſo that by ſuche confeſſyon he is put out of the bondes of the deuyll / and auoydeth the paynes of helle and retorneth vnto Jheſu cryſte for to lyue eternally. oftymes it happeneth that by ſuche Admonycy on man gyueth courage vnto the poore ſynners y• the deuyll of helle holdeth in fere to confeſſe them poorly & entyerly. And the confeſſour ought to labour ſpecyally agayne yonge people / or other ſymple perſones and rude to tell theyr ſynnes. Fyrſt in generall / and afterwarde moeuynge the ayde of ye holy gooſt he ought to dyſcende vnto the partyculers after that he ſhall haue the cauſe and occacyon by that the whiche is ſayd in generall. And thē he may demaūde yf they wyll well that he them examyne to the ende that theyr confeſſyon may be hole / & vnto theyr ſaluacyon in ſhe wynge them that yf by ypocryſye or euyll thynkynge they ſaye not trouth in theyr confeſſyon they lye vnto god y• whiche all can and knoweth / and that ſuche confeſſyon ſholde be more dampnable than merytoryous. and whanne that a man fyndeth ony ſuche ſymple

people the whiche promytten to ſay and to anſwere truely and requyren & wyllyng that a man them examen / after that they haue ſayd that / that they can / a man may not make a more brefe and ſure expedycyon than by the commaundementes of god as ſhall be ſayd here after. And a man ought to aduertyſe the ſynner that he anſwere not to haue done that thynge that he hath not done. As done many the whiche anſwer yes ſyre vnto that / yt a man them demaundeth / be it trouth or leſynge / And for to knowe better to procede in ſuche interrogacyons the confeſſour ought to demaunde the eſtate of the perſone yf he knowe it not. That is to knowe yf he be in the eſtate of maryage / or in the eſtate of the chirche / reguler / or ſeculer / clerke / or laye / noble / or not noble / prelate / or ſubiecte / and of other vocacyons. And than he may forme his interrogacyons / after the ſynnes the whiche mooſt comenly abounden in ſuche people / as vnto the people of the chirch of ſymony / of irregularyte / of ſacrylege / of y• euyll dyſpendynge of the patrymonye of Jheſu cryſte / theſe ben the goodes of the chirche.

That is to knowe by hewe oftymes aman is fallen in to the ſame ſynne For the ſynner it ought to tell and confeſſe yf vnto

hym it be poſſyble / or as nere as vnto hym it may be very ſemblable. And ſo of other thynges / after the dyſcrecyon / and medyfycacyon before ſayd. by the whiche it appereth that the confeſſour ought to haue thre thynges / ſcyence cautelle / and dyſcrecyon / ſcyence for to dyſcerne the dyuerſytees of the maner of ſynnes / cautelle for to enquyre / and to axe / queſtyons / dyſcrecyon for to gyue and enioyne penaunce / or ellys he hym dyſpoſeth vnto grete peryl as well of his ſaluacyon as of them that he confeſſeth. Alſo he ought to warne hȳ that he confeſſeth that he name not / or acuſe another perſone thanne hymſelf yf the ſynne were not of ſuche condycyon that otherwyſe it may not be ſayd / or declared / & he ought not to dyſcende to moche in partyculer in the cyrcumſtaunces of ſynnes / and ſpecyally of the ſynne of lechery / For of that may come the lettȳge of conſcyence / as well in hymſelfe / as in other or to moche grete ſhame vnto hym the whiche is confeſſed / how be it a man may hym warne to declare his ſynne ſo parfytly that his conſcyence grutche hym not afterwarde in that / that he hath not entyerly confeſſed hym / and with the cyrcumſtaūces y• whiche weren of neceſſyte / and whan it cometh vnto the ende of the confeſſyon that the ſynner hath parfytly tolde and declared his ſynnes / by interrogacyons or other wyſe / than the confeſſour oughte hym to ſhewe the errour / and the greuouſneſſe of his ſynnes. And alſo the grace that god vnto hym hath done in that / that he hath abyden hym to do penaunce / and hym to loue fynally in good purpoſe yf vnto hym it be poſſyble / And in good hope of

the mercy of god / and for ſome caſe or ceaſon he may not hym aſſoyle / as for the caſe of excomynȳ
                  ge / or that he wyll not pardonne / or ſeche pardonne or make reſtytucyon / or other caſes he hym ought to counſeyll the forme / and the manere to fynde his remedy / and hym to recōmaunde vnto the ſacred vyrgyn mary foūtayne of pyte / of mercy / and of doynge ony good dedys. For in ſoo doynge god hym ſhall the more ſoner helpe to fynde his remedyes. Alſo yf y• confeſſour knoweth by ony ſygnes or lokynges coniectures or by other waye that the ſynner ſayeth not ſuffyſauntly his ſynnes / he hym ought than to warne / not alonely one tyme but many that yf he leue ony thynge vnto his wyttynge his confeſſyon is no confeſſyon and ſynneth greuouſly. And hym ought to warne to go to another confeſſour / or to retorne to hym another tyme that he may haue other dyſpocyſyon. Alſo be the confeſſour wyſe and dyſcrete / that he enioyne not penaunce vnto the ſynner y• he wyll not receyue wylfully and the whiche is very ſemblable that he ſhal accomplyſſhe ſhewynge hym that yf by forgytful / neſſe or otherwyſe / he it wyll not accomplyſſhe / after that / that he it excepteth and that he it may wel do he ſynneth greuouſly / and is bounden in ſuche caſe to confeſſe hym / Alſo neuer for ſynne ſecrete he ought not to gyue open penaunce. And thoſe the whiche ben confeſſed ought to kepe them well that by mockery / malyce or other curſyd cauſe & thenne they ſhewe not the ſecrete of confeſſyon for in ſoo doynge they ſynne greuouſly / & yf ony perſone hȳ

               ¶Here foloweth the examynacyon of the perſone maryed.
               AS vnto the ſeconde poynt the whiche is of the gouernynge of the perſone maryed in regarde of his ſacrament of maryage / it is to vnderſtonde that after as theſe doctours declaren the werke of maryage / may be accomplyſſhed in fyue maners / ſome tyme merytoryouſly / ſomtyme with out ſynne / ſomtyme with ſynne venyall / ſomtyme with ſuche cyrcūſtaunces that theſe theologyens doubten of mortall or venyall / ſomtyme it is mortall ſynne / fyrſt the werke of maryage may be accō
                  plyſſhed merytoryouſly whan ye one of ye partyes or both .ii. togyder ben in ye eſtate of grace / & theyr intencyō is to haue lyne / or to yelde ye maryage ye one

with the other / or to eſchewe the peryll of auoutry in hym or in her partye / and in kepynge the cyrcū
                  ſtaunces the whiche appertayne vnto the honeſte of maryage / whan it is ſynne there is doute of mortall / or venyall / the good and ſuffycyent confeſſour it may comprehende by the cyrcūſtaunces of the dede / of the intencyon / and of the confeſſyon of people maryed. But in ſeuen maners a man may ſynne mortally with her party after as declaren theſe doctours. The fyrſt is ſuche whan the man alſo ye woman ben ſo moche dyſordynate / that they wyllen by delyberacyon accomplyſſhe the werke of maryage / with party the whiche is not his by maryage / and this caſe is here harde to Juge / as vnto iugement humayn / But god the whiche is Juge of conſcyence ſeeth clerely the troweth. The ſeconde caſe in the whiche he is in daunger of ſynne mortal is whan the one partye refuſeth the other withoute excuſacyon lefull. The thyrde caſe is whan ye man abuſed of his partye for to ſeche more greter pleaſure carnall. The fourth whan the woman is not in dyſpocyſyon of her body that ſhe ſholde yelde the deuoyre of maryage and his partye the whiche hath of it knowlege is ſo moche vnreſonable that he wyll not hym abſtayn / than ſynneth he mortally after as ſayen comenly theſe doctours / but the woman the whiche obeyeth agayne her wyll for to eſchewe the daungers of incontynence / or other yl les the whiche may come in maryage ſynneth not The fyfth is whan theſe people maryed goo vnto theyr wyues in theſe grete feſtes / after as ſayen ſome doctours / how be it ſaynt Thomas ſayeth the

ſynne is not mortall / and the deuoute doctour Bonauenture / and alſo the doctour ſubtyle the ſcotte holden that opynyon / for the chirche he defendeth not the werke of maryage / in theſe feeſtes / but alonely counſeylleth that a man abſteyn hym / to the ende that they be the better dyſpoſed to praye vnto god / for of as moche as a man putteth the more his herte in pleaſures carnalles / of as moche is a man the leſſe dyſpoſed to praye vnto god / and the more ferther frō his loue & they ought to make ſuche abſtynence of a comen aſſent / In lyke wyſe as techeth ſaynt Poul / and yf the one of the ſayd partyes wyll not abſteyne the other partye there ought to obe ye without fermynge conſcyence erronyous / as yf the partye beleueth that it were dedely ſynne to obeye in her partye in the dede of maryage in the tyme of grete ſolempnyte / and neuertheleſſe that notwithſtandynge hym ſhe obeyeth / than ſhe ſynneth mortally alonely / for as moche as ſhe dooth contrary to her conſcyence the whiche is erronyous to byleue as to obeye in her partye in the ſayd tyme is dedely ſynne. The .vi. whan the werke of maryage is commytted in place halowed / as is the chirche / or chirchyerde yf theſe partyes maryed may otherwyſe company togyders / and yf the caſe were knowen / the chirche or chirchyarde ſholde be reconſyled after the ryght. The ſeuenth is whan the woman is with chylde / and nere her tyme / and they haue by ſome experyence / or true ſemblable that the chylde may renne in ony peryll / & neuertheleſſe by theyr incontynence they dyſpoſe them vnto ſuche pareyl they ſynnen mortally after ſome doctours / and vn

to that purpoſe I haue founde other tymes a man maryed that by ſorowe and remors of conſcyence ſought remedy and counſeyll of that / that his wyfe hath hadde foure or fyue chyldern all deed fayr grete and well formed / the whiche knowe not the cauſe ne ye occaſyon of ye dethe of y• ſayd chyldern nor other cauſe they coude not Juge / vnder the Jugement of god but theyr incontynence. for ſo as he ſayd they abſteyn them not for ony dyſpoſycyon / or nereneſſe of chyldynge that was the party / and ſo it appereth in many maners the eſtate / and honeſte of maryage is euyll kept of many people vyle and carnall the whiche oftymes there cōmytten the caſe of the byſſhop and many wronges / of the which they make not ony conſcyence nor make not ony confeſſyon / and oftymes god them ponyſſheth in theyr lyue by as moche that they begete chyldern wronge / croked / lame / blynde / meſſelles / or fallynge on the grete yll. ſo as ſayen theſe holy doctours and therfore a man ſholde take hede and teche yō
                  ge people of the honoure and reuerence / of the fere and of the obedyence that they ought to kepe in ye ſacrament of maryage and how they ſholde mary them pryncypally for the entencyon to haue lyne y• whiche may come vnto the holy ſeruyce of god / & of holy chirche. after ye example of yonge Thobye vnto whome the angell of god taught / that as wel he as his wyfe ſarra them ſholde abſteyne from ye dede of maryage after theyr benedyccyon the eſpace of thre dayes and thre nyghtes / In the whiche tyme they ſholde gyue them vnto holy oryſons / and

ſo he dyde by the whiche he was delyuered from al pareyll and from the temptacyon of the deuyll the whiche hadde before ſtrangled ſeuen huſbondes y• whiche hadde eſpouſyd the one after the other the ſayd Sara / not alonely for the loue of lyne / and of the ſacrament of maryage / but for the beaute of ye doughter and to accomplyſſhe theyr pleaſures carnalles. And this doctryne and techynge haue kepte ſyns many good cryſten men and well taught / of whome they ben founde in the greate benediccion of good lyne / of Joye / of conſolacyon / and of longe lyfe. The ſeuenth poynt is that the confeſſyon is not merytoryous nor ſuffycyent / for to aſke newly the grace of god whan it is done pryncypally by cuſtome / or for fere worldely / and not pryncypally for the loue of god / and of the ſaluacyon of ye ſoule the whiche thynge is done mooſt comenly / ſo as it may be comprehended and arguyde by the lyfe of the more parte the whiche with grete payne them repreſent one tyme in the yere and ryght late before theyr confeſſoure. The .viii. poynt is whan the ſȳ
                  ner hath no wyll nor ferme purpoſe / to ceas and to put ende in his ſynne / for the tyme to come / and to fle the occaſyons of mortall ſynne. The .ix. is whā the ſynner cheſeth vnto his wyttynge for his confeſſour a ſymple chapelayne / the whiche is not ſuffycyent nor idoniū / for to redreſſe the dede of his cō
                  ſcyence / after the vocacyon and eſtate / of the whyche the ſynner may be / or the whiche hath not power to aſſoyle. The .x. is whanne that the ſynner hathe forgoten by his neclygence his penaunce

enioyned / or elles he wyll not do it / be it to requyre pardonne / or to pardon / be it to reſtore another / to faſte / or to make prayer / for in ſuche caſe the confeſſyon is none / and ought to be withdrawen / and ſo it is good counſeyll y• a man accomplyſſhe hys penaunce in the eſtate of grace / for in ſoo doynge he ſe

               ¶ Here foloweth the practyſe that he ought to holde the whiche entyerly hym wyll confeſſe / and examen after the order of the .x. commaundementes of the lawe after the mooſte ſure maner that there may be founde.
               WHo ſo euer wyll well and parfaytly examē
                  
                     Caplm xiiii. his conſcyence in partyculer / he ought to rule hym after the .x. commaundementes of the lawe. For ſo as wytneſſeth ſaynt Auſten a man may not fynde a more certayne practyſe to examen well his conſcyence. Alſo ſayth well ſaynt Gregorye that .x. commaundementes ben as ten myrrours / In the whiche the ſoule cryſtened may clerely ſee and knowe the fylth of his ſynne and of the dyſordynaunce of his conſcyence. Alſo ſayth the ryall prophete Dauyd / I ſhall confeſſe me well and ryghtly for as moche as I haue lerned the ten commaūdementes of god / by the whiche it is well to be noted that no perſone is bounde hym to confeſſe regulerly and of neceſſyte but onely of dedely ſynne the whiche is not other thynge but the tranſgreſſyon of ony of the .x. cōmaundementes in the

whiche ben defended the ſeuen deedly ſynnes / Alſo there be conteyned the ſeuen werkes of mercy / & the trouth of the artycles of oure holy fayth. In y• whiche thynges that is to vnderſtonde in the commaundementes of the lawe / in the artycles of the fayth / and in the ſeuen werkes of mercy is comprehended and cōteyned all the dede of the conſcyence in lyke wyſe as it hath ben ſayd before / And therfore who ſo euer wyll hym well examen and make parfyte & hole confeſſyon after theſe thynges ſayd he ought to take hede how he hath kepte and accō
                  plyſſhed the ten cōmaundementes of god / as well in the thynge cōmaunded that is in ſechynge vertues / and in accomplyſſhynge the werkes of mercy as alſo in the thynge defended / as ben the ſeuen dedely ſynnes. That is to know / pryde / enuy / wrath couetyſe / glotonye / ſlouth / and lechery / In y• whiche ſeuen maner of ſynnes a man may falle often mortally and dampnably And ſomtyme venyall alonely / for it is to byleue that euery paſſyon or mouynge of Ire / of enuy / of vayne glorye / and ſoo of other ſynnes before ſayd ben alwayes deedly ſynne But whan ſuche paſſyons or wylles abyden in the termes of venyall ſynne / or that they exceden tyll vnto mortall ſynne. That thynge is ryght harde vnto Jugement humayne / and it is not poſſyble therin to gyue a rule generall ſuffycyent for to Juge of euery caſe inpartyculer / wheder it be mortall or venyall / after as it hath ben ſayd before in the ſeuenth chapytre of this partye / and therfore as nowe I reſte to ſee in partyculer ſome caſe after y•

                     Caplm .xv. he the whiche wyll well purge his cō

Alſo it is to be noted that for as moche that there hath ben made mencyon in the treatyſe of the cōmaundemen / tes / of all the ſeuen deedly ſynnes.

The dyſpenſacyon or cōmutacyon of the vowe / of chaſtyte / of pylgrymage vnto Jheruſalem / of Rome / of ſaynt James ben reſerued to the pope.

the ſone vnder the yeres of .xiiii. may not vowe / or entre in to relegyon of theyr owne auctoryte not withſtondynge what dyſcrecyon ſo euer they may haue. Alſo auowe is not oblygatory yf it be not made by delyberacyon and full conſent. Alſo a woman maryed may not vowe or obſerue the vowe yt ſhe hath made before the maryage yf her huſbond wyll not ſo conſent / and yf ſhe hath auowed after or before the maryage / the huſbonde her may make it to leue without other dyſpenſe / and withoute the ſynne of ye one or of the other / yf y• huſbonde were not ony tyme conſentynge / The man may well vowe without lycence of his partye the whiche be not vnto the preiudyce of maryage. Alſo they the whiche vowen neuer to kembe them on the fryday or not to ſpynne on the ſatyrdaye / or other ſemblables ſuperſtytucyons ought to leue ſuche vowes ſymple and full of vanytees / But doo after the ordenaunce of theyr wyſe and dyſcrete confeſſour. and other holy faders.

The fyrſte lyberally without ony in tencyon of ony retrybucyon corporall / or temporal ouer the ſomme gyuen / and that maner is good and charytable. Secondly with ſuche condycyon

that he the whiche receyueth that londe of money in marchaundyſynge vnto the halfe of loſſe or of gayne / and ſuche contracte may well be made and he the whiche hath lente may receyue a more greater ſomme than he hath gyuen / But for the condycyon of perſones / or for the aduerſyte of the intencyon of auaryce▪ or of other / he there may haue lettynge.Nota Thyrdly in puttynge the chatell that is the ſomme gyuen in certaynte / and the gayn in certayne / that is to vnderſtande / that leſe or wynne he y• whiche receyueth vnder ſuche forme / he ſhall yelde alwayes the ſayd ſōme / and yf he wynne ye bayllye takyth auantage / here is vſury manifeſte. Fourthly vnto the contrarye of this laſte caſe. That is to vnderſtande in puttynge the gayn in certayne and the chatell vnder incertayne / as for An example / I lene the an hondreth crownes wher with thou ſhalte marchaundyſe at my pareyll with all the ſomme / by ſuche wyſe that after a yere / or another

Fyfthly in puttynge the gayn / and chatell in certayne. as for an example. I lene the an hundreth crownes by ſuche wyſe that after the yere paſte thou me ſhalte yelde an hondreth & .x. here is vſury manyfeſte / vnto theſe v. maner to lene may be broughte all theſe other / But more ouer theſe doctours make a queſtyon yfA queſtyon.

                      Fyrſt a man may well receyue a thynge ſpyrytual as is the lone & the good grace of hym vnto whome he hath lente. Alſo yf of free wyll he gyueth ony thynge or it may receyue / ſo that the lone hath not be made to ſuche intencyon. Secondely by reaſon of dyſdāmage / as yf the lone hath ben made vnder a certayne payne it for to yelde at a certayne tyme / and that by the defaute of that for to do the lender were in dammage without ficcyon / in this caas he may for by cauſe of the dyſdāmage take the ſayd payne with his pryncypall yf that the ſayd payne were not exceſſyue and vnreaſonable. Thyrdely by reaſon and cauſe of the doubte / vnto the whiche the lender is ſubmyſed / in lyke wyſe as it appyreth in the ſeconde caas of the notable before ſayd in lendynge vnto the halfe of loſſe or of gayns. Fourthely by reaſon of the dammage that he renneth in the whiche lended / by cauſe of the ſayd redy. As for an example. At your grete requeſt I lende you an hondred crownes for a yere / in the whiche after god and good conſcyence I ſhall be in dammage in the ſomme of ten or twenty crownes. Than yf he the whiche borowed ſeeth that it ſholde be better vnto his prouffyte to take the ſayd ſomme and to reſtore the dāmage of the lendynge he it may do / & the other it receyue ouer the pryncypall for to kepe hym / & to recompenſe hym the dāmage. Fyfthtly by reaſon of the hyre of a thynge the whiche he may hyre / as oxen / horſes / and other thynges that a man may receyue / 

ſome tymes more in valour that they were at the tyme of the hyre / and with the hyre. But for to receyue more than a man hath lente in ony other maner wyſe than here before hath ben ſayd or done ayenſt the cōmaundement and a man ſelleth the thynge imprecyable / and the whiche proprely may not be ſolde. That is to vnderſtande the pleaſure & the charyte that euery creature ought vnto his neyghbour / as well by ye lawe of nature as by the lawe of holy ſcrypture / the whiche lawes & all other ben they Canons or Cyuyles defenden ye ſynne of vſurye. Alſo yf ony gyne olde corne or other thynge ſemblable for to renewe it hauynge intencyon pryncypall that the newe ſhall be more worth and elles he wolde not gyue it he cōmytted vſurye But yf he do that pryncypally to the intente that his thynge peryſſhe not / or for to do a pleaſure vnto his neyghbour / or in trewe ſemblable doubte yf that the thynge be more worthy or leſſe at the tyme that it ſhall be yelded agayne in ſuche a caas it is none vſurye. The payne of vſurers publyſſhed is ſuche that they ben excōmunycate of ryght wherfore the holy chirche defended that vnto ſuche there be not gyuen the precyous body of Jheſu cryſte. Alſo that theyr oblacyon be not receyued in the holy chirche. Alſo that after theyr deth theyr bodyes ben caſt in a voyde grounde and not receyued in the place holy and bleſſyd. For a man ought not to doubte but that the ſoules of theym the whiche deyen in ſuche eſtate ben dampned with the deuylles in helle / wherfore the bodyes ſholde not be put to reſte with the faythfull cryſten men. And yf in

theyr laſte dayes they requyre penaunce they may not be aſſoyled / but in doynge yt yt in them is poſſyble to reſtore all theſe vſuryes yt they haue receyued in all theyr lyf / & it ſuffyſed not to be receyued vnto ye ſacramentꝭ of holy chirche / & aſſoyled to orden by theyr teſtament yt after theyr dethes theſe vſuryes ben reſtored / but it behoued to dyſpoſe mouable & herytage tyll vnto ye ſomme the whiche may amoūte the ſayd vſuryes & yf they vnto whome he ought to make reſtytucōn ben preſent hȳ behoued them to make full ſatyſfaccion in yeldynge it all / be it by fynaūce maruell / by gage / or aſſygnacōn. And yf they ben abſent ye Juge of ye court or his lyuetenaūt / or ye byſſhop / deane / or curate ſholden repreſent ye perſones in receyuynge the ſayd ſatyſfaccyon & in caas yt mouables & herytagꝭ ſuffyſe not▪ as often it happened after yt they haue all layde mouables & herytages as it is ſayd / they ſholde requyre mercy of god / of holy chirche / & of them vnto whome they ben redyuables / & than a man may them aſſoyle & not elles. For the teſtament that they make in ony maner wyſe is of no valour nor effecte after the ryght. Vnto that peryll is bounden wyues / childern / neuewes / nyces / or enherytoures the whiche wyttyngly retaynen the goodes mouables or herytages of vſurers the whiche haue not made in theyr lyf ſuffycyent reſtytucyon or ſatyſfaccyon / and it ought to be reſtored yf that it be poſſyble / not all oonly the ſomme of that hath ben receyued by vſurye but with that the dāmage that they myght haue hadde by cauſe of theym the whiche haue payed the ſayd vſuryes / by the

whiche it apyreth clerely that full fewe of vſurers eſcapen the deuyll. In lyke wyſe alſo it appyreth the peryll of thoſe y• whiche receyuen in theyr chirches or chircheyerdes vnto ſepulture the body of an vſurer / ſuche as hath ben ſpoken.

                  AS vnto the thyrde poynt the whiche is of fraudes and of decepcyons the whiche is cōmytted of dyuers maners of people / and in dyuers maners the ſynner ſholde take hede. Fyrſte in dede of marchaundyſe ouer the thynges ſayd of vſurye / yf he hath done fraude by fals weyghtes or ony fals meſures or in the ſellynge of ony fals thynge corrupte or meddled in affermynge that it is good and pure be it metalles / appotecaryes / wyne / oyle / or ony other ware / by the whiche the byer is notably defrauded / it is deedly ſynne / ſyns in a lytell thynge it is venyall ſynne. How be it / it is well to be noted that yf ony man defraude and dyſceyued his neyghbour in a lytell thynge

Alſo yf they haue made paccyon bytwene them for to ſelle theyr ware rudely and at a pryce not competent / by the whiche the comons be conſtayned for to bye it at theyr pryce / it is deedly ſynne. Alſo yf he be payed with one ware for an other

Alſo yf he hath payed ſymple people in fals moneye / it is fraude and decepcyon and deedly ſynne. Alſo yf he hath vſed flaterynge ſpeche and of ſwerynges / to ſelle indyfferently at the daye of the feſte cōmaunded / or in halowed place often there is deedly ſynne.

And therfore they ſholde conſyder theyr eſtate & occupacyons / as well by them as by the ayde of theyr confeſſour / & declare the fraudes that they knowen well to do / & to ſpeke more ſubtylly y• no clerke by wrytynge may them declare / & they ſhold telle wheder they were for to leue ſuche maners of

And therfore in ſuche caas and other ſemblable he may well dyfferre reſtytucyon with purpoſe to reſtore in place and in tyme. Alſo reſtytucyon may ſomtyme be vnto the grete peryll and dāmage of hym vnto whome it

By theſe thynges beforſayd appyred ynough yt yf the thynge wt

it foloweth that the woman may not recouer ſaluacyon yf ſhe make not reſtytucyon. But of y• maner many grete theologyens & lawyers it determen dyuerſely.

The fyrſte is the lye by the whiche a man doth noyſaūce vnto one / and doth prouffyte vnto another / The ſeconde is that by the whiche a man doth noyſaunce vnto another without prouffytynge another. The thyrde maner is that y• whiche is contrary vnto the holy fayth catholyque / as ben herytykes the whiche ſowen errours and fals doctrynes ſomtyme for to come vnto theyr lecheryes / as thoſe the whiche affermynge that ſymple fornycacyon is not mortall ſynne / or that the ſynne of lechery is not ſo grete / or ſo greuous In lyke wyſe as ſayth theſe holyſcryptures / & theſe prechers / the whiche it cōdampnen / ſomtyme ſuche is commytte by ſuche lyenge couetyſe / As ben thoſe the whiche prechen vnto ye ſȳple people as for to gyue

The ſeconde maner of lyenge is that the whiche is done by dyſporte / and is commytte in two maners. The fyrſte by dyſordynate pleaſure that a man taketh in tryfylles & talkynges. The ſeconde by a deſyred dyſordynate / and to pleaſe the herers reherſynge fables / or dyſportes & in theſe two maners may he haue mortall ſynne / or venyall / after the cyrcumſtaunces of the dyſordenaunce and of the mater of whiche a man ſpeketh / or of the perſones of the whiche a man ſpeketh / or vnto whome ſuche lyes ben tolde.

The fyrſte is in ſharpenes of hete / for it is more hote than is oures / of as moche as oures is more hoter than yt the whiche is paynted on a wall after as ſayth ſaynt Auſten the

whiche is none other thynge to vnderſtonde but y• we be not ſuffycyent for to ymagen the exceſſe of ye fyre of helle in regarde and comparyſon of oures. Of the whiche euer more we haue ſo meruaylous experyens that there is no metall / ne other thynge but that it melteth / brenneth / or altreth / and therfore eſmeruayll ye torment of the fyre of hell what it may be. The ſeconde dyfference of the fyre of helle / and of oures / is as vnto the hardenes for oures is in beynge leſſeth and conſumeth his mater / but that of hell is eternall / and neuer leſſeth / For for euer her mater ſhall endure▪ That is to vnderſtonde the body and ye ſoule of dampned ſynners them holden alwayes in one maner.

                  THe ſeconde payne is of water colde / & dyffereth from that of this preſent worlde in foure thynges. The fyrſte is oppreſſe of colde / for lyke wyſe as the brennynge of the fyre of helle ſurmounteth the brennynge of oures / euen ſo the colde in the other worlde ſurmounteth the colde in

this worlde by ſuche maner that yf the mooſt greteſte moūtayne of the worlde were of yren maſſyf and embraſed as was euer ſtele for to forge / and it were put in the tormente of the ponde of yſe in the coldenes of hell
                        •
                      / it ſholde be from parte to parte yſe. alſo as in a moment. And therfore ſayth well ſaynt Gregorye that ſuche colde is intollerable / & yf a man demaunde wherfore oure lorde ſayth not as well in the goſpell / departe you from me acurſed dampned and go ye in to the colde eternall as he ſayth into the fyre eternall. The anſwere / for aſomoche as the fyre amonge other elementes is y• mooſt actyf and the mooſt afflyctyf / therfore god vnto vs gyueth example of fyre more ſooner than of the yſe. I put that he it gyueth ynough to vnderſtonde by other places of y• goſpell / where he ſayth that theſe dampned ſhall wepe and ſhall grynde theyr teeth for coldenes. The ſeconde dyfferēce of ye water of helle & of this worlde is for y• of hell neuer chauffeth for ony thynge hote y• whiche vnto it may be gyuen / but euer more abydeth in one eſtate and degree of coldenes. The thyrde dyfference is that / yt of helle is euermore trouble full of ſtenche and incomparable erroure: The fourth dyfference is for that helle maketh not theſe dampned to dye but in lyke wyſe as theſe fyſſhes lyuen in the water in this worlde / ſo theſe dampned may not dye in the water in that worlde.
               
               
                  THe thyrde payne is to crye & to braye in wepynge and in playnynge ye whiche torment

is the cauſe for foure thynges. Therfore as moche that the dampned knowen that they ſhall neuer ſe god / the whiche is the mooſt greteſt payne of helle for theſe ſaued / or theſe dampned loue better to be in helle for euer / and to ſee god than to be in paradyſe & ſee hym not yf ſuche thynge were poſſyble And in ſuche wyſe yt none ne may ſpeke nor thynke the melodye the whiche is made in paradyſe as well of the blyſſed angelles as of holy men and women yblyſſed. In lyke wyſe there is none that may declare the pyteous and horryble trye and howlynge the whiche is made in helle as well of deuylles / as of other dampned / And yf a man demaunde what they ſaye in cryenge. The anſwere. All the dampned curſen the creature. Alſo they curſe togyders / as theyr fader and moder / and the houre that they were begoten / that they were borne / and that they were put vnto nouryſſhynge / and thoſe y• them ſholde correcte and teche / and alſo thoſe that haue ben the occaſyon of theyr ſynnes / as the baude curſyd be the baude / and alſo of other occaſyons in dyuers ſynnes. The ſeconde cauſe of the crye of them dampned is for the conſyderacyon that they haue of the tyme of mercye the whiche is paſte. In ye whiche they may do penaunce and purchaſe paradyſe / The thyrde cauſe is of theyr crye for by cauſe of y• horryble paynes that they enduren. As we may cō
                     ſydere that yf an hundreth perſones hadde euery of them one fote and one hande in the fyre or in the water ſethynge without power to dye / what bruyt and what crye they ſholde make / but that ſholde be leſſe than nothynge in comparyſon of deuylles

and of other dampned / for they ben more than an hundreth thouſande thouſandes the whiche all-togyders vnto them doeth noyſaūce / and all in one thondre cryenge and brayen horrybly. The fourth reaſon of ſuche clamoure is for as moche that they bē dyſpeyred for euer to haue remedy. A man may demaunde how that may be as after the Juſtyce dyuyne that for one oonly ſynne the whiche hath be ſo ſone done and ſo lyghtly cōmytte a. ſoule the whiche hath ben of god ſo moche beloued the whiche vnto the ymage of hymſelf hath be made and fermed is dampned eternally vnto ſo grete depnes and confuſyon of paynes and tormentes. The anſwere may be made by the example of a byeng of an herytage the whiche is done in a lytell tyme & how be it he gyueth the ryght of poſſeſſyon in perpetuyte. In lyke wyſe the ſynner ſelleth his ſoule and the ryght that he hath vnto ye royalme of paradyſe in lytell whyle. By the whiche he is dyſenheryte for euer / and vnto eternyte of paynes condampned. Alſo a ſtroke is ſone ſtryken wherof ye deth foloweth without euer to recouer the lyfe. Alſo a man is anone fallen in to ſuche a dytche ſoo yt the aryſynge is impoſſyble. The anſwere by reaſons the ſynners the whiche in theyr ende haue be foūde in ſynne mortall haue ſynne in eternyte for yf they hadde lyued in this worlde euer more hadde they contynued theyr ſȳne. By the whiche of good ryghte they ſholde haue payne without ende. Alſo after the deth the ſoule and the wyll ben innuuables be it in good or in yll. And for as moche that the curſyd wyll of thoſe that be dampned dureth &

perſeuereth in her iniquyte ſhe ought for euer more to abyde in paynes alſo the ſynne in the whiche ye dampned ben deed / is agayne the god of eternyte / By the whiche after Juſtyce eternall and infynyte the payne ought to be without ende. Alſo for a lytell tyme of true penaunce / or of a good werke done in the eſtate of grace / god gyueth in eternyte y• royalme of paradyſe / by the whiche Juſtyce it requyreth that in lyke wyſe / alſo for one oonly ſynne mortall of the whiche a man myght in lycell tyme do penaunce is gyuen payne eternall and of yt eternyte of paynes ſhall be ſpokē after more plaȳ

                  THe fourth payne is ſmoke. By the whiche it is to vnderſtonde that euen in lyke wyſe as ſmoke herebyneth is the cauſe of the thyknes of the fyre from whens it ſheweth derke & blacke and ingendreth ſtenche and prycketh the eyes / procureth terys / letteth the ſyght and hurteth ye brayne So in ſhewynge that of all paynes poſſybles there are in hell abundaūce.

And he beynge in ſuche ennoyſaūce thought in hymſelfe profoūdly what ennoye and doloure he myght haue yf he were condāpned hym to holde and abyde in the bedde where he laye tyll vnto y• eſpace of two or of thre yeres wtout ſeynge other lyght / or perſone / & conceyued in hymſelfe yt for no ſōme of golde / or of ſyluer / he wolde ſuffre to be comdampned vnto ſuche ennoye & ſuche torment. And afterwarde thought yet more profoundly what it myght be of thoſe the whiche haue not done ſuffycyently penaunce on this behalue / by the whiche they ben Juſtely adiuged to be an hondreth yeres and ſome other more / & other leſſe in tormentes and in the ſharpe fyre of purgatorye / the whiche is ſo harde and ſo anguyſſhous a thynge to bere & endure / yt none ne may it thynke / and moche he meruaylled of the payne / and of y• ennoye that they myght haue in awaytynge the daye of gladnes that they ſholde be crowned in the royalme of paradyſe & delyuered from all the paynes for euer without ende. But ſo as god wolde he thought more profoundly what it myght be of thoſe the whiche ben in helle dampned in eternyte of tormentes who awayte not nor truſte not for euer to haue ſocours ne lyghtynge in ony ſpace of dayes or of myllyons

of yeres / and by this conſyderacyon and thȳ kynge he conceyued ſuche fere / and ſo grete admyracyon that for his folyſſhe and curſyd lyfe he myght not one tyme come vnto ſuche confuſyon where incontynent he dyſpoſed hȳ to leue his lyfe worldely & ryght peryllous in cōſyderynge y• with grete payne / and well late thynken theſe worldly people of thynges y• whiche vnto them ben fynally for to come / & after in full fewe dayes lefte y• worlde & entred in to y• relegyon of cyſtoriencis in y• which he prouffyted ſo gretely in thynkynge on y• paynes of helle. the Joyes of paradyſe & other holy medytacyons / y• for his grete holynes & medytacyon and perfeccōn of good lyfe he was choſen ryght holely byſſhop of tholouſe / in y• whiche offyce & dygnyte he ended vnto y• glorye of god his dayes.

And therfore to y• ende y• thoſe y• whiche wyll ſtudye in this preſent booke hauynge mater more haboūdantly offere & to eſmeruayll y• eternyte of the ſayd paynes of helle.

               ¶ Here foloweth the chapytre of y• cauſes & reaſōs wherfore ye paynes of helle ſholde be eternall.

Here folowen many cauſes and reaſons by the whiche it is euydently ſhewed y• the ſayd paynes ought to be eternalles wtout euer there to haue releaſynge / & pryncypally for thre reaſons generalles. The fyrſte is vnto ye regarde of y• condycyon of mortall ſynne. The ſeconde vnto the regarde of the creatour the whiche is gloryous & eternall. The thyrde is the conſyderacyon of the vnyuerſall worlde.
               
                  AS vnto the fyrſte yt is of the conſyderacōn of ſynne it is to vnderſtonde yt for four reaſons Juſtyce dyuyne requyreth y• ſynne be punyſſhed in eternyte. The fyrſte is for yt / that after all Jugement of reaſon / ye offence of ſȳne ought to be w
                        •
                     yed & punyſſhed after the dygnyte / grete / lytell or meane of hym the whiche is offended / for none ne may ymagen yt it were no grete offence to ſtryke vniuſtely a byſſhop thā a ſymple chapelayne / or y• ſouerayn byſſhop yt is y• pope thā another man of the chirche in leſſe dygnyte. Now is it ſoo that by euery ſynne mortall god is offended ſoueraynly & as moche greuouſly as his maieſte is dygne & infynyte. By the whiche it foloweth that Juſtyce requyreth payne who anſwereth / & by the conſequent infynyte for euery mortall ſynne. The ſeconde reaſon is for as moche that by mortall ſynne euery (creature is depryued from

welth eternall the whiche is god / and by ſuche wyſe he hym ſubmytteth vnto his opoſyte / y• is damp nacyon eternall. The thyrde reaſon is for aſmoche y• mortall ſynne depryueth y• creature from welth paſte / preſent / & to come. The welth paſte yt is the paſſyon of y• blyſſed Jheſu cryſte without ye whiche it were vnpoſſyble vnto all ye worlde to mowe euade the bondes of y• deuyll / and euer more by mortall ſynne a man hym depryueth from ſuche benefyce. The good preſent yt is the meryte of holy chirche from the whiche the ſynner beynge as a ſynner is depryued & ſeueryd. The goodes to come yt ben the goodes of glorye y• whiche by good Juſtyce ſholde not be gyuen in ony wyſe vnto thoſe the whiche ben enemyes & aduerſaryes vnto the creatoure as ben all thoſe y• whiche fynally abyden in mortall ſynne. The fourth reaſon is for aſmoche that mortall ſynne of his propre condycyon deſtroyeth all the good dedes of the creature y• whiche he cōmytted / for euery thynge deſtroyeth his contrary in as moche as is in hym / as it appereth of fyre & of water / of lyght and of derkenes / and ſo of other thynges contraryes. Now is it ynough certayne yt there is nothynge contraryous vnto the wyll dyuyne but oonly ſynne / and by the conſequent ſynne deſtroyeth and putteth vnto nought as moche as is in hym the wyll dyuyne and ſo putteth all y• blyſſed Trynyte vnto nothynge and in ſuche wyſe he deſtroyeth all the worlde / as well the holy men & women of paradyſe / as alſo all theſe other creatures / for it is Impoſſyble that creature may

be to haue enduryd but in that / that god hym holdeth and conſerueth and yf god be dyſtroyed by ſȳ

But it is a thynge impoſſyble ye god may not be / or to dye / by the whiche it foloweth & behoueth yt ſynne be punyſſhed after ye puyſſaūce / ſapyence & eternyte of his contrary yt is god / & yf it were not done / there ſholde be defaute of Juſtyce. and yf Juſtyce dyuyne and infynyte defayle / god ſhold defayle / Alſo the ſynner the whiche dyeth in mortall ſynne / ſynneth in eternyte / for yf he alwayes hadde lyued / alwayes he hadde ſynned. And in as moche as that he endureth in ſynne / he oughte to endure punycyon. Alſo yf the ſȳne the whiche euer endureth were not for euer punyſſhed / the Juſtyce penytyue ſholde be to moche vnlawfully dyuynyſſhed and all trouth dyuyne defraudyd / ye anoyntyd the whiche ben thynges to moche impoſſybles. Alſo as moche grete is the tranſgreſſyon / as y• grete oblygacyon. Now is it trouth that euery creature is bounde to ſerue and honoure his creatour the whiche thynge he may not do the whiche is in dedely ſynne / but more ſooner doth the contrary that is to knowe to blaſpheme and to dyſhonoure god. By the whiche he is the tranſgreſſour of the lawe dyuyne and of nature the whiche ben lawes eternal les. By the whiche it foloweth that ſuche tranſgreſſyon ought to be punyſſhed eternally.
               
               
                  
                  AS vnto the ſeconde poynt the whiche is in the comparyſon of the ſynne / and of the creature agayne whome it is done / it is to vnderſtonde that for foure reaſons he ought to be punyſſhed eternally. The fyrſte is for the grace that god hath done vnto the creature humayne / For of as moche as the grace / or the benefyce done vnto ony is grete / of as moche is greter the offence or the for fayte of hym the whiche is redeuable / or ſhall yelde accompte before hym whome he ought to ſerue & honoure / As for an example.

                  THe ſeconde Joye of the partye of the ſoule / is parfyte to loue ye whiche procedeth of. iiii thynges. The fyrſte is god wherfore it is to be notyd that reaſon & experyens vnto vs ſhewen that of as moche that ſome thynge is of more grete valoure / of as moche is it worthy to be the better beloued / and of as moche that it is the better belouyd & deſyred it is the more greate Joye for to haue the poſſeſſyon and the fruycyon. Now is it ſoo that in god is all bonte / ſapyence / honoure / and nobleſſe / ſwetnes Joye and gladnes / and ſo of other perfeccyons infynytes the whiche may be deſyred and loued.

By the whiche it behoueth to ſaye that all thoſe y• whiche of ſuche & ſo grete goodes haue ſure poſſeſſyon eternall they haue moche more greater Joye of hym / than of ony other thynge / of as moche that god is more greate good than is all other good create. And ſyns he is all good and welth in fynyte it appereth clerely that he ought to be by loued infynytly aboue all other goodes the whiche may be ſpoken or thought. Now is it ſhewed that of loue cometh Joye and gladnes as grete as the loue may be. By the whiche it foloweth that the Joye that theſe bleſſyd haue / for the loue that they haue vnto god / in god / and of god is infynytly in infynyte aboue all other Joyes that they may haue. / of ony other good create by ſuche maner that ſuche Joyous pleaſurs and gladneſſes that euer weren in perſone or creature / or myghtebe / ben leſſe thynge vnto the regarde of theym the whiche proceden of the lyuely fountayne of the bleſſyd Trynyte theme is a drope of water vnto the regarde of all the ſees. The ſeconde thynge the whiche we ſholde loue after god / that is oure ſeluen after the ordenaunce of god and alſo of nature and of trewe charyte. And therfore for as moche that the ſauyd ſeen that they haue purchaſed welth infynytly and euerlaſtynge withoutende / and that they haue done the thynge by the whiche they ben comen vnto the grace of god / and vnto the glorye of paradyſe they hym louen / and the goodes that they haue purchaſed as moche as they ben / and that

they haue purchaſed greate welth. For as moche as they haue purchaſed welth infynyte and euerlaſtynge / as moche is grete theyr loue in them ſeluen and of theym ſeluen. And by the conſequent as moche is greate theyr Joye and nombre / thynke it who that may. The thyrde thynge the whiche we ſholde loue / that is that we ſholde loue our neyghbours and the maner of the loue after god and holy ſcrypture is as our leluen and of this Joye it hath bentouched here before in the ſeconde artycle of the fyrſte Joye. I put that it is another chynge to ſe and to vnderſtonde the welth of hys neyghbour / and another thynge hym to loue / for the one procedeth of the vnderſtondynge / and the other of the wyll / but for the comon rule it ſuffyſeth as nowe that euery ſauyd enioyeth hym of the welth and merytes of his neyghbours of as moche the more that they ben in the more grete nō

And in lyke wyſe is the wyll full of loue / of the whiche procedeth a Joye and a gladnes as moche greate as may be the knowlege and the loue. And for as moche that of god aloonly is knowen the nombre of the choſen and the degree of all theyr Joyes and merytes. And alſo is y• glorye of cuery of them yt he hath vnto the regarde of ye loue of his neyghbour. The fourth thynge that we

O how moche ought he to haue grete deſyre / and grete hope the whiche infynytly is certayne for to come vnto ſo grete gode. The ſeconde cauſe of this certaynte / is for as moche as god and nature haue ordeyned that euery thynge the whiche is comen vnto his ende ceſſe his mouynge in receyuynge the perfeccyon the whiche appertayneth vnto the degre of his nature and of his condycyon. Now is it ſoo that the eſperyte humayne create ſo nobly by puyſſaunce dyuyne than is in the ende and conſūmacyon whan it is vnyed with god as well by grace as by glorye / for in that he hath the accomplyſſhment of all his deſyres & poſſeſſyon of goodes infynyte. By the whiche he may neuer other thynge appetyte / but abyde alwayes in ſuche ſtedfaſtnes of the beatytude euerlaſtynge. The thyrde cauſe of certaynte is for by cauſe of the eſtate of inmortalyte / For ſyns that ſpyryte create hath taken his body / vnto the whiche he hath naturall inclynacyon / and that he hathe deſeruyd in this brefe and mortall lyfe for to come vnto the begynnynge of euery creature the whiche is god / it is Impoſſyble after the lawes / that haue ben inſtytute by the ſapyence dyuyne vnto his creatures but that he abyde in the ſtedfaſtnes of the eternall vyſyon of the bleſſyd trynyte. The fourth cauſe of this ſure ſted faſtnes yf for the valu of the good / vnto the whiche theſe bleſſyd ben come / that is god the whiche is the good infynyte. /

And more ouer the whiche is not Impoſſyble that a man may other thynge loue / but in hym and for hym. By the whiche as well the mynde as the vnderſtondynge and wyll ben parfytly deyfyed and ſo there is parfyte certaynte of the beatytude eternall without ony admyxicyon to put in of varyablyte / wherfore euery creature ſholde take payne for to come vnto ſuche bleſſydnes eternall.

                  THe fyfth Ioye of the partye of the ſoule / is abondaunce of all goodes the whiche ben yelden them in the ſoule in foure partes. The fyrſte is of god the whiche is fountayne and depneſſe of all goodes the whiche may neuer be ſpoken nor wryten / nor herte humayne ne may it thynke / and therfore he the whiche hath ſuche perfeccyon of goodes he hath all without that / that it vnto hym may ony thynge defayle / And he that hadde an hondreth thouſande worldes and

                     holde be pryue of this In the whiche is ſuche parfeccyon of godes he myght well ſaye that he hadde nothynge. The ſeconde is of hymſelfe / for the ſoule ybleſſyd her poſſedeth in god in her ſouerayne perfeccyon of all his puyſſaunces / and of his vertues / and merytes. And therfore it is well ſayd that who ſo putteth his herte aboue all in god he hath his herte / & ſo hath god / and he that it putteth in another place he leſeth his herte / and ſo leſeth god. The thyrde is for the preſence of the company as well of y• .ix. ordres of aungelles / as of the patryarches / appoſtles / martyrs / confeſſours / and vyrgynes / and for the conſummacyon of the charyte the whiche is in paradyſe the welth of the one is the welth of the other in lyke wyſe as it hath ben before ſayd and declared. The fourth is for that that the godes before ſayd ben all togyders not the one after the other / or the one withoute the other / and the ſoule choſen in hym and by hym the whiche is al / myghty / is ſoo vygoryous in all his puyſſaunces that ſhe may haue knowlege / loue and alſo grete

gladnes / as well of god / as of all the creatures / as well in euery of them in partyculer as of all togyders for euery momemt / and for euer without ende By this it appereth that euery true cryſten man hȳ ſholde enforce to mowe come vnto ſuche goodes to ſuffre an hundreth thouſande tymes y• deth ryght Ioyouſly yf it were poſſyble and god it ſholde requyre / but by his mercy he doeth it an hondreth.

                  THe ſyxte Ioye of the partye of the ſoule is honoure incomparable for foure thynges. The fyrſte is for his deuocyon / deuocyon is aſmoche to ſaye as dedycacyon / or to be ordeyned to ſerue god and hym prayſe. And for as moche that ye ſoule ybleſſyd is ryght parfytly the temple of the bleſſyd trynyte / ſhe is bayned in the lyght of the loue infynyte / and embraſed with ſouerayne & ryght parfyte deuocyon.

                  THe ſeuenth Joye of the partye of the ſoule is beautefull of admyracyon in foure maners. The fyrſte is in beaute of vnderſtondynge / the whiche is the clere knowlege of god and alſo of his creatures / As it hath ben touched here before. The ſeconde knowlege is the beaute dyuyne the whiche illumyneth and maketh the ſoule gloryous for to ſhyne an hondreth thouſande tymes more than ye ſonne The thyrde is y• beaute of noble vertues with the whiche the ſoule is innornyd / as ſholde be a ryght ryche veſtyment with grete multytude of golde and of precyous ſtones the whiche hath ben ſette by a werkeman ſouerayne in ſhynynge varyacyon of dyuers colours / for he the whiche hath innornyd the heuen with dyuerſe bodyes ſhynynge and the erth with the erbes and the trees beynge grene / and the ſee and the ayre with fyſſhes and foules fleynge / floures and feders ſo dyuerſely paynted and fygured that ſouerayne werke man hath ineſtymable paynted / and ennornyd his doughter / his loue / and his eſpouſe / his trone and his reclynatorye.

That is to vnderſtonde / Juſtyce / force / prudence / and attemperaunce / ſhall holde the ſoule without ony reſyſtence in her operacyons agayne god / and agayne euery creature / for by the vertue of force the ſoule is vnyed with god / by Juſtyce ſhe is ſubiecte vnto god / by prudence ſhe cheſeth to ſee god aboue all thynges / by attemperaunce ſhe is not ſubiecte nor letted by ony mouynge of paſſyon the contrarye / yt is beaute and ordenaunce ſpyrytuall ne may not be ſhewed vnto vnderſtondynge humayne for this preſentlyfe but ryght lytell in comparyſon of the trouth.
               
               
                  THe eyght Joye of the partye of the ſoule is for the eternyte of her glorye the whiche is greate and incompreuable for foure thynges. The fyrſte is for the preſence and conformyte that ſhe hath with god. The ſeconde for the company and amyable charyte that ſhe hath with the aungelles and the aungelles with her. The thyrde for the vnyon and Joyous conſyderacyon of her wyll wt the ſayntes of paradyſe / and all the ſayntes with her. The fourth for the tranquylyte that ſhe hath in herſelfe by that / that ſhe ſhall be ſure and confermed in the eternyte of her glorye and bleſſydnes and for as moche that all theſe thynges the which haue ben touched here before / it is not neceſſarye to prolonge this artycle.

The ſeconde comparyſon is vnto dyuerſe partyes of the body / for a man ought not ymagen that the eyes & the face of the body gloryous aren in ony degree more clere and more ſhynynge than ſhall be the foot or the legge. The thyrde comparyſon is vnto theſe other bodyes gloryous / for in lyke wyſe as we ſee yt the ſonne & the mone & all ye ſterres of ye ſkye haue one ſuche dyfference in theyr clerenes yt tweyne may not be foūde in all ſemblables / a lyke thynge is it of the bodyes of ye bleſſyd. The fourth comparyſon of the good werkes done durynge the vnyon of the body and of the ſoule in

this mortall lyf / for the bleſſyd haue glorye & prayſe of all the good werkes yt they euer dyde in this worlde for the loue of god weren they in the eſtate of grace or in mortall ſynne / how be it that in that there is grete dyfference in lyke wyſe as it hath ben ſayd before. By the whiche it appyred that a man may deſyre to lyue longely for to amende his lyf / & for to excercyſe hym in his good werkes / of the whiche a man may haue Joye & prayſe without ende. The prayſe of the good dedes done in the eſtate of mortall ſynne is a Joye accydentale the whiche cometh as well vnto the body as vnto the ſoule for as moche that they haue in ſome wyſe diſpoſicyon & preparacyon to retorne vnto the eſtate of grace. Of that ſayth Alexander of hales in his ſumme that the good werkes may be ſuche that durynge the tyme that a man is occupyed in them a man taryeth as for ony ſucceſſyon of tyme the mortall ſynne is not aggrauate durynge the occupacyon of thoſe good werkes.

Alſo they contynue the ſoule in lyf mortall & vertuous. Alſo thoſe the whiche done theyr penaunce in ſuche eſtate of ſynne ben acquyte. Alſo they occupye the tyme in ſuche wyſe that without thoſe good werkes a man ſholde

falle in to ydlenes or in to more grete ylle. Alſo they make the perſone partener in the good dedes of his neyghbour. Alſo they letten many grete loſſes & curſyd aduentures the whiche theſe ſynners haue deſerued & augmenten the goodes temporels as ben helth of body / rycheſſe of golde & ſyluer / & of other poſſeſſyons / for the whiche goodes they ſhall haue honoure & glorye yf they ben one tyme ſauyd.

Alſo a man is not ſo moche punyſſhed in helle or in purgatorye as yf a man had ben ydell or occupyed in euyll werkes in the tyme that a man hath done thoſe good dedes. Alſo they prouoken the bonte of the creatoure for to gyue grace vnto the ſynner to reknowlege his gylte & for to fynde mercy. By the whiche it behoueth to ſaye that the body & the ſoule of the ſaued haue glorye accydentale for ſuche werkes how be it that they haue ben done in the eſtate of mortall ſynne.
               
                  THe ſeconde Joye of the partye of the body is perfecte impaſſybylyte for foure thynges.

The ſeconde for the body gloryous ſhall not beHec dicit thomas anglici in ſuo. iiii. with the body gloryous / for two bodyes gloryous for to be togydres repugne of good congruyte and vnto the ordre that the ſapyence inyfynyte hath put in thynges treate.
