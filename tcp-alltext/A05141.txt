Sermon of Mayter
Hughe Latimer, whiche
he preached before
the Kinges Maiestie
wythin his graces
palayce at
Westminster,
M.
D. XLIX. the .viii.
of March.

            ¶To the ryghte vertuous
& gracious Lady Katherin
Douchesse of Suffolke, Thomas
Some, her humble and faythfull
Oratoure, wysheth
Godly fauoure
and euerlasting
saluacion
from god the father
through Iesus Christ our
mercyfull Lorde.
            
               WHan man is borne for
man, that one to another
shoulde be a God, and not a
deuyll, an helper, no hynderer.
Vnto whom also the vse
of the tonge is only geuen, wherby they
do both expresse & shewe the affections of
their mindes, there is no man which can
say, I haue no nede of any man.
            ☜But amonges infinite mischiefes and
euyls of manns pouertie and anguish, by
which he hath nede of other mēnes helpe,
is the instruction of prudence or vertue &
of science. For mākynd doth in thys precel
chiefly brute beastes because thei helpe
one another by mutual communication.
            
               
In learnynge good and vertues maners,
the vse of communyng is required
chiefly, that men errynge and ignoraunte
should be taught, for there is none which
shall euer learne of him selfe, all thoughe
he be neuer so happily borne.
            Therfore, it shal become euerye man,
which doth intēd to lyue godly, to heare &
learne godly bookes, to printe heauenly
documentes in their hartes. For as euyll
doctrine, deuilysh bokes, and fylthy talke
do corrupt good maners: so faithfull preceptes,
godly bokes, chast commonynge
and honest, shal edifie, and confirme.
            Wherfore▪ intendinge to do good vnto al
mē & namely vnto suche, as erre & be ignorant,
I haue gathered, write, and brought
into lyght the famous fryday sermōs of
Mayster Hugh Latimer, whiche be preached
in Lent last past, before oure moste,
noble Kinge Edward the sixte, at the new
Palaice of Westminster, the thirde yeare
of hys reigne. Whiche Sermons (moste
vertuous Lady) I dedicate vnto your honorable
grace, nothing doubting but that
you wyll gladly imbrace them, not onlye
because of their excellēcie, but chiefly for
the profyte whyche shal ensue thoroughe
them vnto the ignorante.
            
               
For in them are frutefull and godlye
documentes, directing ordinatly not only
the stepps, conuersatyon, and liuing of
kinges: but also of other mynisters and
subiectes vnder hym. And let no man be
greued though it be not so exactlye done
as he did speake it, for in very dede I am
not able so to do, to write word for word
as he did speake, that passeth my capacitie
though I hadde .xx. mens wittes, and no
fewer handes to wryte withal. As it is vnpossyble
that a litell ryuer should receyue
the recourse of the main sea wt in his brymmes,
so that no water should ouer whelm
the sides therof: In lyke maner is it more
vnlyke my sym
                  •
               le witte to comprehende
absolutely the abundaunt eloquence and
learnyng which floweth most abundantli
out of godly Latymers mouth.
            Notwithstandyng, yet had I rather with
shamefastnes declare charitably thys
parte of hys godly documentes, & counsel
then with slowthfulnes forgette or kepe
close folyshly, that thyng which may profit
many.
            Who is that wyll not be glad to heare
and beleue the doctryne of godly Latimer?
Whome God hath appoynted a
prophet, vnto our most noble Kyng, and

vnto our Realme of England, to declare
the message of the lyuynge God, to supplante
and rote out al sinnes and vice, to
plante & graffe in mens hartes the plenteousnes
of all spiritual blessynges in Iesus
Chryst our Lorde?
            Moses, Ieremias, Helias, dyd neuer
declare the true message of god vnto their
rulers and people, wyth a more syncere
spirite, faithfull minde and godlye zeale,
then godlye Latymer both now in oure
daies vnto oure moste noble Kyng & vnto
the whole realme.iij. King. xxij Furthermore also Iosia
receyued neuer the boke of gods wyll
at the handes of Helkia the hie preiste, or yt
admonicion of Hulda yt prophetesse, with
a more perfect and godly feare, then oure
most noble Kinge doth moste faithfullye,
geue credite vnto the wordes of good father
Latimer. And I haue no doubte but
all godly men wyl lykewise receiue gladly
his godly Sermons & geue credit vnto
the same. Therfore this my rude laboure
of another mans swet (most vertuous lady)
I offer most humbly vnto your grace,
moued ther vnto of godly zeale, thorough
the Godlye fame, that is disperst vnyuersally of your most godly disposicion, and
vnfayned loue towardes the lyuynge,

almyghtye, eternall God and hys holye
word, practysed dayly both in your graces
most vertuous behauour, and also
godly charitie towardes the edificatiō of
euery membre graffed in Chryste Iesu,
most humbly desiryng your grace to accept
fauorably thys my temerous interprise.
And I your most humble and faythful
Oratour shall praye vnto Iehouah,
the God which is of himself, by whom,
and in whome, all thynges lyue, moue, &
be, that, that good worke whych he hath
begonne in you he may performe it vnto
your laste endynge, thorough our Lorde
Iesu Chryst, who preserue and
kepe your grace now and
euer. So be it.
         
      
      
         
            
            ¶The argument of the Sermon.
            
               IN this fyrst Sermō is declared,
& taught the godlye election
of a Kyng, and a rule of
godly lyuynge as touchynge
hys owne person. Where he
proueth oure moost excellent
King Edward, to be our most lawful king
both by natiuitie, and cōtrey, yea, and now
appoynted in these our dayes to delyuer vs
from the daunger and captiuitie of Egypt
and wicked Pharao, that is from, errour &
ignorāce & the deuelishe antichrist the Pope
of Rome. The forme of his godly rule also
he deuyded here in this sermon in thre partes.iij.
Fyrst that he shuld not truste to muche
vnto his owne strēgth and policy, but only
to walke ordinatly with God and to make
him his lodes man and chief guyde. Secondarily
that he lyue not lassyuyously and wā
               tonly,
folowyng venerial affections, but to
lyue chastly. And whan time shal require, to
leade a pure lyfe, vnder the yoke of matrimonye,
admonishing both his grace, and al
other Maiestrates to be circūspecte in chosynge
a wyfe, eyther for them selues or for
theyr children, hauing this alwaies in minde,
that she be, of a faythfull house, godlye
broght vp, & of a pure life. Thirdly he admonyshed
the kynges grace, that he should not
desyre gold & syluer to muche, prouyngs by
many argumentes that kynd of vice wyth
the other forsaid, to be destruction not only
vnto the kynges grace: but also vnto the
whole realme & people, In these thinges cō
               systith
the whole summe of this sermon.
         
         
            
            The fyrst sermon Of M. Latimer.
            
               
                  QVecunque scripta sunt: ad
nostram doctrinam scripta
sunt. Roma. xv. 
                        •
                     
                  
                What soeuer
thynges are written
a fore tyme, are wrytten
for our learnynge, that we
through pacience & comforte of
scripturs, might haue hope. In
takynge thys parte of scripture
(moste nobill audience) I playe
as atrowāt, which whē he is at
schole, wyl chose a lesson, wherin
he is perfight, because he is
loth to take payne in studienge
a newe leasson, or elles feareth
strypes for his slothfulnes. In
lyke maner, I might seme now
in my olde age to sum men, to
take this parte of scripture, because
I woulde wade easilye awaye
there wyth, and dryue my
matter at my pleasure and not

to be bounde vnto a certayne
theame.Paul speketh of gods worde only. But ye shall consyder, yt
the forsayd words of Paul are
not to be vnderstāde of all scriptures,
but only of those, which
are of god, writtē in goddes boke,
and all thynges whiche are
therein, are wrytten for out learnynge,
The exellencye of thys
worde is so greate, and of hye
dignitie, that there is no earthly
thynge to be cōpared vnto it
The authour therof is great
that is God him selfe,Gen. i. a. and xvij. a. Deut. iiij. a Esa. xxvi. a. Pron. viij. c Daniel. vij. e. eternal
almightie, euerlastynge. The
scripture, because of hym, is also
greate, eternal, moste mightie,
and holy.Almen ought to obay god, to beleue hys word, & to folowe it. Ther is no kyng
Emperour, maiestrate, and ruler,
of what state so euer they
be, but are bounde to obey this
God, and to geue credence vnto

hys holy worde in directynge
theyr steppes ordinarlye accordinge
vnto the same worde, yea
truly they are not only bound
to obey gods boke, but also the
minister of the same, for the wordes
sake, so fer as he speaketh
syttinge in Moses chayre, that
is;God ruleth this world wt two swerdes if hys doctrine be taken out
of Moyses lawe. For in this
world God hath .ii. swerdes the
one is a temporall swerde the other
a spiritual.The temporal swerd. The temporall
swerde resteth in the handes of
Kynges, Maiestrates, and rulers
vnder hym, whereunto all
subiectes, as well the Cleargye
as the laytie be subiecte, and punishable,
for any offence contrary
to the same boke.
            The spiritual swerde is in the
handes of the ministers & preachers,The spiritual swerde.
               
where vnto all Kynges,
Maiestrates &, Rulers ought to
be obediente, that is to heare,
and folowe, so longe as the ministers
sitte in Christes chayre,Mathe. xxiij.
that is, speakyng out of Christes
boke.
            The Kynge correcteth transgressours
wyth the temporall
swerd, yea, and ye preacher also, if
he be an offender: But the preacher
can not correcte the kynge
if he be a transgressor of goddes
word, wyth ye temporal swearde,
But he muste correcte and reproue
hym wyth the spyrituall
swearde, fearynge no man, settynge
God only before hys eyes,
vnder whome he is a minister
to supplante and roote vppe all
vyce and myschiefe by Goddes
worde, whereunto all menne

oughte to be obedyente, as is
mencyoned in manye places of
scripture, and amonges manye
this is one.Math. xxiij. a
            
            ¶Quecunque iusserint vos seruare,
seruate, et facite.
            What so euer they byd you
obserue, that obserue and doo.
Therfore let the preacher teach
improue,i. Timo. iij. a. Peter. i. a. amende an instructe
in ryghtuousnes, wyth the spyrituall
sweard, fearynge no man
thoughe death shoulde ensue.
Thus Moyses fearyng no man
wyth thys swearde,Exod. v. vi. vij. &c. dyd, reproue
Kyng Pharao, at Goddes commaundement.
            Micheas the prophet also dyd
not spare to blame Kyng Achab
for hys wyckednes,iij. Regu. xxv accordynge
to goddes wyl, & to prophesye of
hys destrucion contrarye vnto

manye false Prophetes. These
forsayde kynges beynge admonyshed
by the ministers of gods
worde, because they woulde not
folow theyr godly doctryne and
correcte theyr lyues,King Pharao punished▪
                came vnto
vtter destruccion. Pharao geuynge
no credite vnto Moyses
the prophet of God, but applyant
vnto the lustes of hys owne
herte,Exod. xiiij what tyme he heard of the
passage of Goddes people, hauyng
no feare or remembraunce
of gods worke, he dyd prosecute
after entendyng to destroye thē,
and was drowned in the red sea.
Kynge Acab also because he
wold not herken vnto Micheas
was kylde with an arrow.Acab. iij. Regu. xxi. Like
wyse also the house of Ieroboā
wyth other many,iij. Reg. xiiij. came vnto destruccion,
because he woulde not

heare the ministers of Goddes
worde, and correcte hys lyfe accordyng
vnto hys wyl, and pleasure.The preacher must haue God before his eies chiefly.
Let the preacher therefore
neuer feare to declare the message
of God vnto all men. And
if the kyng wyll not heare theim
then the preachers maye admonyshe
and charge theym wyth
theyr dewties, and so leaue them
vnto God and praye for theym.Euel preachers are to be refused, & not to be beleued.
But if the preachers digrese out
of Christes chaire, & shall speake
their owne Phansyes, then instede
of. Quecunque iusserint vos, facere,
facite, et seruate.
            What so euer they bid you obserue,
that obserue & do. Chaūge
it into these woordes foloweynge:Mathe. vij. g Cauete vero vobis apseudo Prophetis
qui veniunt ad vos. &c.
            Beware of false Prophetes

whych come vnto you in shepes
clothyng, but inwardly, they are
rauenynge woulffes, ye shall
knowe theym by theyr fruites:
Yea, change Quecunque iusserint
(yf their doctryne be euyll) into
Cauete a fermento pharise orum,Luke. xij. a &c.
            That is Take hede and beware
of the leauen of the Pharyseis,
& of the Saduces. In teachinge
euell doctryne, all preachers are
to be eschewed, and in no wyse
to be harkened vnto. In speaking
trueth, thei are to be heard.
All thynges wrytten in goddes
boke,In godsboke is matter for all estates. are moost certaine true,
and profitable for all men. For
in it is contayned mete matter
for Kynges, Prynces, Rulares,
Byshoppes, and for all estates.
Wherfore, it behoueth euerye
preacher, sumwhat to appoynte

and accomodate him selfe, and
hys matter agreable vnto the
comforte, and amendemente of
the audience, vnto the whiche he
declareth the message of God.
If he preache before a kyng, let
hys matter be concernynge the
office of a kinge, if before a byshoppe,
then lette him treate of
byshoplye dutyes and orders,
and so forthe in other matters,
as time & audience shal require.
            I haue thoughte it good, to
intreate vpon these wordes folowynge
whyche are wrytten in
the .xvii. Chapter of Deuteronomye.
                  Deut .xvij.
Cum ueneris in terram quam
Dominus Deus dat tibi possederisque
eam, et ceter. That is. When thou
art come vnto the Lande whyche
the Lorde thy God geueth
the, and enioyeste it, and dwellest

therein: If thou shalt say, I will
set a Kyng ouer me, lyke vnto al
the nacions that are aboute me:
Then thou shalt make him king
ouer the, whome the Lorde thy
God shall chose.
            One of thy brethren must thou
make Kynge ouer the, and maiest
not set a straunger ouer the,
whiche is not of thy brethren.
But in anye wyse, lette hym not
holde to manye horsses, that he
brynge not the people agayne to
Egypte, thorowe the multitude
of horsses, for as muche as the
Lorde hathe sayde vnto you: ye
shall hence forthe go no more agayne
that waye. Also he shall
not haue to manye wyues, leaste
hys herte turne awaye, neyther
shall he gather hym syluer and
goulde to muche. As in diuerse

other places of Scriptures, is
mete matter for all estates, So
in thys forsayde place is dyscribed
chiefely the doctryne fyt for
a kynge. But who is worthye to
vtter thys doctryne before oure
most noble kynge? Not I God
knoweth, whyche am throughe
age, both weake in body, and obliuious,
vnapte I am, not onely
because of paynefull studye, but
also for the shorte warnynge.
Wel vnto God I wyl make my
mone, whoe neuer fayled me.
Auxiliator in necessitatibus.
            GOD is my healper in all my
necessities. To hym alone wyll
I make my peticion. To praye
vnto sayntes departed I am not
taughte, to desyre lyke grace of
God as they had (ryghte Godly

it is (
                  •
               or to beleue God to be no
lesse mercyfull vnto vs beynge
faythful) thē he was vnto them,
greatly comfortable it is. Therfore
only vnto God let vs lyfte
vp our hertes and say the lordes
prayer.
            
               GVm veneris. &c.Thinges touched most chiefly in the hole sermon. When
thou art come vnto y•
lād which the lord. &c.
Thou shalt appoynte
him king. &c. One of thy brethrē
                must thou make king ouer the, &
must not set a straūger, ouer the
which is not of thy brethren.
            
                But in anye wyse let not suche
one prepare vnto hym selfe many
horses, that he bryng not. &c.
            
                Furthermore let hym not prepare
vnto hym selfe manye wyues,
leaste hys herte recede from

God. Nor he shal not multiplye 
vnto hym selfe, to much goulde,
and syluer. As the text doeth rise
I wyll tuch and go a lyttle in euerye
place, vntyll I come vnto
to muche. I wyll touche all the
forsayde thynges, but not to
muche. The texte is, when thou
shalt come into the land. &c.
            To haue a kynge the Israelites
dyd wyth muche importunitye
call vnto God, and God longe
before promised theym a kynge,
and were fully certified thereof
that GOD had promised that
thynge.Gen. xvij. a. For vnto Abraham he
sayed: Ego crescere te faciam vehementer,
ponamque te in gentes, sed et reges
ex te prodibunt.
            That is, I wyl multiply the excedyngely,
& wyl make naciōs of
the, yea & kinges shal spring out

of the. These wordes were spoken
longe before the chyldren of
Israell had any king. Notwithstandyng,
yet God prescribed
vnto thē an order, how thei shuld
chose their kynge, & what maner
a man he shoulde be, where he
sayeth: whan thou shalt come in
to the lande. &c. As who shoulde
saye, O ye chyldren of Israell I
knowe your nature ryghte well,
which is euyl, and inclined vnto
al euyls. I know that thou wilt
chose a kyng to raygne ouer the,
and to apere glorious in the face
of the worlde, after the manner
of Gentyles. But because thou
arte styffe necked, wylde, and art
geuen to walke wythoute a brydel,
and lyne. Therefore nowe I
wyl preuent thy euyl and beastly

manners, I wyl hedge strongly
thy waye, I wyll make a durable
lawe, whyche shal compel the
to walke ordinatelye, and in a
playne waye, that is thou shalt
not chose the a Kynge after thy
wyll and fantasye, but after me
thy Lorde and God. Thus, God
condicioned wyth the Iewes,
that their kinge should be suche
a one as he hym selfe wold chose
theym.Anotable tale. And was not muche vnlyke
the bargayne that I hearde
of late shoulde be betwixte two
frinds for a horse the owner promised
the other shoulde haue the
horse if he would, the other axed
the price, he sayd .xx. nobles. The
other woulde gyue hym but .iiii.
pound, the owner said he should
not haue hym then. The other
claymed the horse bycause he

sayde, he shoulde haue hym if he
would. Thus thys bargayne be
came a Westminster matter, the
lawyers gote twyse the valure
of the horse, and when all came
to all, two fooles made an ende
of the matter. Howe be it, the Israelites
coulde not go to lawe
wyth GOD, for chosynge theyr
kynge, for woulde they, nyl they
theyr kynge shold be of hys chosyng,
lest they shoulde walke inordinatly,
in a deceyuable waye,
vnto theyr vtter losse & destruccion.
For as they say communly
Qui vadit plaue, vadit saue▪ that is.
He that walketh playnely,A common saing. walketh
safelye. As the Iewes were
styfnecked, and were euer ready
to walke inordinatelye, no lesse
are we Englyshe men geuen to
vntowardnes, and inordinate

walkynge after oure owne fantasyes
and braynes. We wyll
walke wythoute the Limites of
Goddes worde, we wyll chose a
kyng at oure owne pleasure.i. Regu. xix. a
            
            But let vs learne to frame oure
lyues after the noble kyng Dauyd
whyche when he had manye
occacions, geuen of kyng Saul
to worke euyll, for euyl, yea, and
hauynge manye tymes oportunity
to perfourme mischiefe and
to slay kyng Saule, Neuerthelesse
yet fearynge,i. Reg. xxiiij. a Read ye stories they be verye pleasaunt & profitable. would, not folowe
hys fleshlye affections and
walke inordinatelye, wythoute
the wyll of Gods worde, whych
he confessed alwayes to be hys
direccion,Psal. cxviij. 
                     •
                  . sayinge. Lucerna pedibus
meis verbum tuum et lumen semitis
meis.Gods worde is oure lyght. Thy worde, O Lorde
is a Lanterne vnto my feete,

and a lyghte vnto my steppes.
Thus hauynge in mynde, to
walke ordinatly he dyd alwaies
auoyde to do euyll. For whan
kynge Saul was in a caue with
out anye man, Dauyd and hys
men syttynge by the sydes of the
caue, yea and Dauyds men mouynge
hym to kyl Saul, Dauid
made answere and said vnto thē:
Seruetiue dominus,Danyd dyd walke ordynatly. ne remistani. &c. cō
               tra
dominū meū Messiam. &c. That is
The Lorde kepe me from doing
this thyng vnto my maister yt is
the lordes anoynted. At another
tyme also, moued by Abisay to
kyl Saul sleping, Dauyd sayd:i. Reg. xxvi. b
Ne interficias eum, quis enimimpune
manum suam inferret vucto domini. &c.
That is: Destroye hym not, for
who can laye hys handes on the
Lordes annoynted and be gylteles

&c. I would God we woulde
folowe kynge Dauyd, and then
we should walke ordinatly, & yet
do but that we are bound of dutye
to do, for God sayeth: Quodego
brecipio, hoc tantum facito.
            That thyng which I command
that on
                  ••
               y do.Phantastical brayns are reproued inordinatly. There is a greate
errour risen now a daies among
many of vs, whyche are vaine &
newe fangled men, climbyng beyond
the lymites of our capacitye
and witte, in wrenching this
texte of scripture, hereafter folowing,
after their owne phantasie
and braine,i. Regn. viij, their errour is vpon
this texte: Audi vocem populi in omnibus
que dicunt tibi, non enim te reprobant
sed me reprobarunt, ne regnem super
eos.
            That is: Heare the voyce of the
people in all that they saye vnto

the, for they haue not caste the awaye
but me. They wrench these
wordes awrye after their owne
fantasies, & make muche doubte
as touchynge a kynge, and hys
Godlye name. They that so do
walketh inordinatly, they walke
not directly and playnly, but delite
in balkes, and stubble waye.God calleth hys ministers by dyuerse names.

            In any wyse,The seconde parte of hys sermou. lette no suche a

horses. &c. In speakynge
these wordes, ye shal vnderstād,
that I do not entende to speake

agaynste the strengthe, polycye,
and prouysyon of a king, but agaynste
excesse, and vaine truste
that kynges haue in them selues,
more thē in the liuinge god
the authour of al goodnes, and
geuer of al victorye. Many horses
are requisite for a kyng, but
he maye not excede in them, nor
triumphe in them, more then is
nedefull for the necessarye affaires
and defence of the realme:
what meaneth it, that god hath
to do wyth the kynges stable?
But only he woulde be mayster
of hys horsses: the Scrypture
sayeth,Psal. cxii. In altis habitat, He dwelleth
on hye, it foloweth. Humilia
respicte He loketh on lowe thynges,God is grād mayster in ye kinges house
yea vpon the Kynges stables,
and vpon all the offyces in
hys house. God is great grande
mayster of the Kynges house, &

wyll take accompte of euery one
that beareth rule therein, for the
executyng of their offices: Whether
they haue iustly and truely
serued the kyng in theyr offyces
or no. Yea God loketh vpon the
kynge hym selfe, if he worcketh
wel or not. Euery kynge is subiecte
vnto God, and all other
men are subiectes vnto the king
In a king God requireth fayth,
not exces of horsses. Horsses for
a kyng be good and necessary, if
thei be wel vsed. But horsses are
not to be preferred aboue poore
men. I was ones offended wyth
the kynges horses, and therefore
toke occasion to speke in the presens
of the kynges maiestie that
deade is, whan Abbeis stode. Abbeis
were ordeyned for the comforte
of the poore. Wherefore I

sayde it was not decente that the
kynges horses shoulde be kepte
in theym (as manye were at that
tyme) the lyuynge of poore men
therby minished and takē awai.
But afterwarde a certayne noble
man sayed to me, what haste
thou to do wyth the kinges horses:
I answered, & sayd, I speke
my conscience as Goddes word
directeth me. He saied: horses be
the maintenaunces and parte of
a kynges honoure, and also of
hys realme, wherfore in speking
agaynste theym ye are agaynste
the kinges honour.An answer declarynge the true honoure of a kynge. I answered:
God teacheth what honoure is
decente for the kynge and for all
other men accordyng vnto their
vocacions. God apoynteth euery
kyng a sufficiente lyuyng for
hys state and degree, boeth by

lādes and other customes. And
it is lawfull for euery kynge to
enioye the same goods and possessions.
But to extorte & take
awaye the ryghte of the poore
is agaynste the honoure of the
kynge. And you do moue the
kynge to do after that manner,
then you speake agaynste the
honoure of the kynge. For I
full certifye you,He describeth ye dyshonors of a Kyng playnely and most truelye. extorcioners,
violēt oppressers, ingrossers of
tenementes & landes, throughe
whose couetousnes, villages de
caye and fall downe, the Kynges
leige people for lacke of sustinaunce
are famished and decayed.
They be those whyche
speke agaynst the honour of the
Kynge.god requiret y• a good herte. God requyreth in the
king and al magistrates a good
herte, to walke directlye in hys

wayes. And in all subiectes, an
obedience dewe vnto a kynge.
Therefore I pray god both the
kyng & also we hys people may
endeuer diligētli to walke in his
wayes, to hys greate honoure
and oure profite.The. iij. part of the sermō. Let hym not
prepare vnto hym selfe to many
wyues. &c. Althoughe we reade
here that the kinges amongest
the Iewes,Kinges of the Iewes had a dispensacion to haue mo wyues then one. had libertye to take
more wyues then one, we maye
not therefore attempte to walke
inordinatly and to thynke that
we may take also many wyues.
            For Christ hath forbydden
thys vnto vs Christians. And
lette vs not impute synne vnto
the Iewes because they hadde
many wyues. For they hadde a
dispensacyon so to do. Christ
limitteth one wyfe vnto vs only

And it is a greate thynge for a
man to rule one wyfe ryghtely, &
ordinatly. For a woman is frayl
and procliue vnto all euels, a
woman is a very weake vessel, &
maye sone deceyue a manne, and
brynge hym vnto euel. Manye
examples we haue in holy scripture.
Adam had but one wyfe
called Eue,On wyfe is hard eo be wel ruled. and howe sone had
she brought hym to consent vnto
euell, and to come to destruccion.
Howe dyd wycked Iesabel
prouente Kynge Hachabs herte
from God and al godlynes, and
fynally vnto destruccion.A godly woman is to be chosen. It is
a very hard thynge for a man to
rule well one woman. Therfore
let oure kynge, what tyme hys
grace shalbe so mynded to take
a wyfe, to chose hym one, whych
is of God, that is, whyche is of

the houshoulde of fayth. Yea let
all estates be no les circumspect
in chosyng her, taking greate deliberacion,
and then shall not
nede dyuorsementes, and suche
myscheues, to the euyl example
and slaunder of our realme,Loue whych is godli is to be preferred aboue al erthly thinges in maryage. and
that she be one as the kynge can
fynd in hys hert to loue and lede
hys lyfe in pure and chaste esposage,
and then shall he be the
more prone and redy to aduaūce
gods glory, punishe and extirpe,
the greate lecherye vsed in thys
realme. Therefore we oughte to
make a continuall prayer vnto
God, for to graunte our kynges
grace such a mate as maye knyt
hys herte and hers, accordynge
to Goddes ordinaunce and law,
and not consider and cleaue onelye
to politycke matter or coniunccion,

for the enlargynge of
dominions, for suertye and defence
of contreys, settyng aparte
the institucion and ordinaunce
of God. We haue nowe a prety
litle shillyng, in dede a very prety
one.A notable saiynge. I haue but one I thinke
in my purse, and the laste daye
I had put it awaye almoste for
an olde grote, and so I truste
some wyll take them. The fynenes
of the Syluer▪ I can not se.
But therein is Printed a fyne

prynted in the herte of the kyng
in chosynge hys wyfe,The well of life or wysdō
                and in all

feare of God is fons sapiencie, or vite,

               
                  •
               o the forgettyng of GOD is

politike matters death doth ensue
and folowe. All their deuorcementes
and other lyke condiciones
to the greate displeasure
of almyghtye God, whyche euylles
I feare me, is much vsed

but in the infancy suche

of god & breach of espousals.

Grace shoulde beare in memory
an hystorye of a good kyng called
Lewes, that trauaylled towardes
the holye lande (whyche
was a greate matter in those dayes)
and by the waye syckened,
beynge longe absente from hys
wyfe. And vpon thys matter the
Phisicians did agre, that it was
for lacke of a woman,The good counsel of Byshops. And dyd
consulte with the bishoppes ther
in, who dyd conclude that because
of the dystaunce of hys
wyfe (beyng in an other contrie)
he shoulde take a wenche. Thys

good kinge hering their conclusion
would not consent ther vnto,
but sayde: he hadde rather be
sycke then vnto death, then he
wold breake his espousals. Wo
worth such counsellers, bishops,
naye rather Bussardes. Neuertheles
if the kynge shoulde haue
consented to their conclusyon,
and accomplished the same, if he
had not chansed wel, they would
haue executed the matter as I
haue hearde of two that haue
consulted together, and accordynge
to the aduyse of his frend
the one of them wrought, where
the succession was not good.
            The other imputed a piese of reproche
to hym for hys such coū

sayeinge that he gaue hym
none other counsell, but if it had

bene hys cause he woulde haue
done lykewyse. So I thinke the
bishops would haue excused the
matter, if the king shoulde haue
reproued them for their counsel.No

I do not rede that the King did
rebuke them for their coūcel, but
if he had, I knowe what would
haue bene theyr answere. They
woulde haue saide, we geue you
no worsse councel, then we wold
haue folowed oure selues, if we
had ben in like case: wel sir this
Kynge dyd well,The kinge fearyng god auoyded euil & had the feare
of God before his eies. He wold
not walke in bywalkes, where
are many balkes. Amōgest many
balkīges, is much stūbling, &
by stōling it chaunceth mani times
to fal downe to the ground.
And therfore, let vs not take any
bywalkes, but let gods word.

directe vs, let vs not walke after,
nor leane to our owne iudgementes
& procedynges of oure
forfathers, nor seke not what
they dyd, but what they should
haue done, of which thing scripture
admonysheth vs, sayinge:
            Ne inclinemus preceptis et traditionibus
patrum neque faciamus quod videtur
rectum in oculis nostris.De. xii. a.
            
            Let vs not incline our selues
vnto the preceptes and tradycyons
of oure fathers, nor lette
vs do that semeth ryghte in our
eyes. But suerlye, we wyll not
exchange oure fathers doynges
and tradicious, wyth scripture,
but chiefely leane vnto thē and
to theyr prescripcion, and do
that semeth good in oure owne
eyes. But suerlye that is goynge
downe the ladder, Scala

Celi as it was made by the
Pope, came to be a Masse, but
that is a false ladder to brynge
men to heauen. The true ladder
to brynge a man to heauen is
the knowledge and folowynge
of scripture. Let the kynge therfore
chose a wyfe whiche feareth
God, let hym not seke a proude,
wanton,The .iij. part of the sermō. and one ful of rich treasures
and worldelye pompe. He
shal not multiply vnto him selfe
to much gold and siluer.
            Is there to muche thyncke you
for a kynge? God doeth alowe
muche vnto a kynge, and it is
expedyente that he shoulde haue
muche,A kinge may haue muche, for his expences are great for he hath greate expenses,
and many occasions to spend
much for the defence and suertie
of his realme and subiectes.
            And necessary it is that a kynge

haue a treasure alwayes in a redines,
for that, and suche other
affaires, as be dayly in hys handes.
The which treasure, if it be
not sufficiente, he maye lawfully
and wyth a salue conscience,
take taxes of hys subiectes. For
it were not mete the treasure
shoulde be in the subiectes purses,
whan the money shoulde be
occupied, nor it were not best for
them selues: for the lacke thereof,
it myghte cause both it, and
al the rest that they haue should
not long be theirs.Note whan the king hath to much of hys comens. And so for a
necessarye and expediente occasion,
it is warranted by goddes
worde to take of the subiectes.
But if there be sufficiente treasures,
and the burdennynge of
subiectes be for a vayne thyng.
so yt he wyl require thus much,

or so much of his subiects (whiche
perchaunce are in greate necessitye,
and penurye) Then this
couetous intēt, and the requeste
thereof,Who shall se thys to much is to muche, which God
forbiddeth the king here in this
place of scripture to haue. But
who shall se this to much,None that be seruauntes to the Kinge. or tell

is, that the kinges maiestie whā
he commeth to age, wyll se a redres
of these thynges so oute of
frame. Geuynge example by letting
doune his own hādes first
& then enioyne hys subiectes to
folowe him. The second hope I
haue is, I beleue that the general
accomptyng day is at hand,
the dreadfull day of iudgement
I meane, whych shall make an
end of al these calamities & miseries.
For as the Scriptures be
Cum dixerint pax pax. When they
shal say, peace, peace: Omnia tuta,
all thynges are sure: Thē is the
day at hand, a mery day I saye,

for all such as do in thys world
studye to serue & please god, and
continue in his fayth, feare and
loue: & a dreadeful, horible day
for them that decline from God
walking in their own waies, to
whom as it is writtē in the .xxv
of Mathewe is said:The reward of wycked men. Ite maledicti
in ignem eternum. Go ye curssed into
euerlastynge punishmente.
Wher shalbe waylinge & gnasshing
of teeth. But vnto y• other
he shal saye:The blesse of the godly. Venite benedicti come
ye blessed chyldren of my father
possesse ye the kyngdome prepared
for you from the beginnynge
of the world, of
the which god make
vs al partakers.
            Amen.
