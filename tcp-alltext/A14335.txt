               , & by his Lordships well tempered command, all humors well tuned, neuerthelesse since the

               uent the worst, layd these reasons as one step to his proiect.
            Further his Lordship had 4 little fortresses called 
                  •…
               eddotts in hand at the same time vpon the Rampart of the old towne, for the better securing thereof with few men if the enemy shold attempt vs, for those little skonses would haue been their scourges vpon their entrie, (ech on flanking other) & one guardable against their furie with few men, for besides their Ramparts they now are fenced about with heighty and very strong pallizadoes, these begun workes lay open and nothing neare 
                  •…
               
               shed, and this was another branch of his Lordships 
                  •…
               eares.
            After al these cōmeth the maine which was, as his Lordship was certainly enformed, that the Archduke was resolued that night to attempt 
                  〈◊〉
                manner following, viz. The counte de Bukquoy, who commaundeth the forces on the East-side of the towne, was to giue onset at the North-east rauelling of the old towne vpon a low water which serued that time excéeding wel for their purpose falling out about 6 of the clocke at night.
            Then from the West they purposed to trie vs by the Sandhill, and in two places more of the old Towne viz. the port dupied which is a small rauelling in a counterscarp, lying West North-west from the towne, and is indéed a place of great inport for the kéeping of the Towne-dich full with water, and to preuent the enemies passage to scape our maine Rampart, and this place by furie of the sea, and rage of their Cannon, lay then méerely open and not tenable by any meanes.
            Their other places where to come on, were our outward works, lying South and by West from the towne, called the South square, the Poulder and the West square, from which last worke commonly called the Collonels worke, they had about 3 wéekes before béene gallantly repulsed in the night by our guardants, being all English, and driuen to returne with farre lesse bloud, then they brought thither.
            Another reason which was very powerfull with his Lordship, was a noble & religious care and sence to spare the 
                  〈◊〉

                  〈◊〉
                shed on both sides.
            Inuested with these extreames of impendant dangers, his Lordship after many bitter trauerses through his great hart y• scornes to stoope, to the mightiest enemy whosoeuer, found that neuerthelesse the be

            But by the way, I had forgotten to tell you 
                  〈◊〉
               , that vppon precōsultation, al our outward works aboue mentioned, were to be abandoned,

                of our numbers was such as came farre short of a proportionable guard for the town alone, yet through the slacknes of the states, his Lordship had formerly béen driuen to extenuate his sayd works to halfe their greatnes, to make them guardable by few men, for they doe much import the safetie of the towne.
            Nowe

And although it were their Christmasse euen, and thereby fasting day, they did not forbeare eating fish, eggs, and such ionkets, besides as a towne so long besieged could affoord, taking out in Clarret wine what they lacked in meate.

               , answering euery man in the cuppe, and yet gaue no manner of appearance of yeilding any way to distemper. During their sitting at supper, many smart testes were bandied with good dexteritie on both sides. Amongst others, I remember Serano plotting a passage by circumstāce of words, to discourse of their perfect busines, gaue his Lordship occasion to tell him that his Altesse desired all, and the States woulde willingly part with nothing. The Spanyard replyed, that the Archduke demaunded but his owne: to that his L. tolde him, hee had neuer studied the Lawes to Iudge of mens titles, but that in England wee doe commonly holde possession, 11 poyntes

of the 12, the lawe is bounden withall, &c. Another was, hys Lordshippe told them, that now his highnes hauing continued his siege with such admiration and fame, as that in this age & compasse of the world, the like hath not béen heard off, and driuen vs to abandon our outward works, & to retire our selues altogither into our towne, he might with great honour arise & leaue vs, and thereby preuent the ruine of his armie, which through wet lodging, and continuall labour, must néeds be extreamly decayed, and also preuent the effusion of much Christian bloud otherwise.
            To this Serano replied, that since his L. had with such honour as was applauded throughout all Christendome, so long preferued this place against so powerfullan enemie, and that as they all knew most certainely, many extremities had ouertaken him, whereby he was enforced to withdrawe himselfe wholly into that little ruinous nest, it could bee no manner of blemish to him to y

            The Spaniards (hauing the faire hopes of his fruitfull haruest thus quite blasted with this cold nipping answere) did neuerthelesse in the most temperate manner he could, smother & suppresse his almost choaking discontent: for hee dreamed by y• negotiating of this busines, to haue made himselfe famous to ensuing ages, and so with this cold breake-fast (in stead of his Christmasse pie) he foorthwith departed, leauing his companion behind him, till our Captaine should be returned homehis passage backe was by boate at South-west from the Polder Rauelling, where he could sée almost no part of our fortification, & vpon his repaire into their trenches, Capt.

All this while our workes in the old Towne were aduanced with all diligence, and secresie possible, and made defensible before our Mart ended. Our newe forces landed also this day, betwéene 12 and 2 of the clocke in the culde towne, in despight of the enemies Cannon, without anye more losse then the hurt of the two shippers, & as I can learne of two soldiers, but none killed, nor those mortally wounded.
            And yet to giue the enemie his due by saying the full truth, they were more then bountifull of powder and shot, to hinder our mens landing. All this while wee remayned quiet on both sides without shotte little or great, but the next morning (being Wednesday) they first opened the windowes of their wonted displeasure; it being my Lords pleasure, that euerie man in towne should be quiet, till the enemie shoulde giue occasion to the contrarie, and then wee resaluted them with good Cannon, and so all thinges stand on their former frame, all our outward workes rep

            Wee haue vnderstoode of late by an Italian gentleman one of their Centinells Perdues, who was brought prisoner into towne, that the Archduke is highly offended with his counsell of warre for diuerting him frō the execution of his resolution, which was to haue attempted vs on the Sondaye night, (so often spoken of before) with 6000 men, &c. that by reason of the extremitie of his passion, fewe of them dare come in his presence, for preuenting his oportunitie by their dissw

            By Cannon there remaineth small hope for him, if the States faile not to send Rise-wood to repaire therewith in the night what hee spoyleth in the day: for, with Rise and sande mingled, we worke chiefly on both sides, we haue alre

Besides this, all our Bulwarks looking towards their trenches are vnited, and prepared for all such accidents.
            Then, eyther furie, faction, or famine must open him way, for furie here is little cause of feare, if (as I sayde before) the States can, and will furnish their towne with sufficient nū

            And to be famished (vnlesse both the states, and England abandon vs) were verie strange: for (notwithstanding all y• battries the enemie hath eyther at East, or West, on the sandes or piles of the ould Hauen, or else where) we haue, when the winde serueth, some nights 40 sailes of Hoyes and Smackes come in togither, and scarse one man hurt.

            As I was about the shutting vpp of this tedious and ill digested discourse, Newes came that the Archduke hath nowe at last pacified, and reconciled all his mutinous soldiers which haue béen long time in Brabant, as at Derst, Herentalls and other places thereabouts, holding for none but for themselues (their discontent growing from want of pay, which it séemeth the
