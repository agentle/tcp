               MY LORD,
            
            
               THE Common-wealth hath beene compared by many (and that verie fitly) to a goodly and well-composed Idifice, which consisteth of manie parts, different both in vse and substance; whereof some serue to sustaine the waight of the Building, as Pillars, and such are the Nobility: Others, to containe or keepe the same in an vniformity, as Beames; and such may bee compared to the Magistracy: Others to defend and couer the frame, from the violence of outward iniuries, as Rafters and Postes, which may be referred to the Comminalty. Now, we doe obserue, that as in all priuate Buildings that consisteth onely of these three parts, they cannot bee saide to bee perfect without other things for their finishings; whereof some are Ornaments, and serue but to beautifi

               ncerning the worthinesse of the Author, or woorth of the worke, my testimony would rather detract then adde. Onely thus much, that as amongst all humane sciences Physicke is the most excellent; and in Physicke, Chirurgerie is the most Authenticke and ancient; so this operation is of Chirurgery the most vrgent and necessary, or rather an Abstract of the whole Art of Chirurgerie.
            Against Obiection, I haue your Lordshippes patronage for my defence, and therein I shall thinke my selfe as safe as in an Armour of proofe; knowing that it is a point of Greatnesse, as well to defend the weake, as to resist the strong.

               LOuing Brethren, and my kind Companions and fellow-Trauellors, you haue heere presented vnto your fauourable acceptance, a Treatise of the cure of Wounds made by Gunne-shot: the worthinesse whereof, I cannot better expresse, then to say Parie wrote it; a Man experienced with forty yeeres practise, at that time when France did most groane vnder the burthen of the vnciuill Ciuill Factions, bred by her homebred Enemies; wherein there was not any notable assault, siege, nor battel fought, but Ambrose Parie was chiefely imployed about the cure of wounded souldiers, as hee himselfe testifieth in his owne Booke of voyages and trauels. Accept it therfore thankfully, as a gift from the Author, as it was first intended. And although it may be obiected, that in these peaceable times this Treatise is of little vse, and therefore vnprofitable: true it is, and with thankfulnesse to be acknowledged,

we liue in a calme and quiet age, but is therefore this so necessary and worthy a Document to be neglected? Because it hapneth but sildome, wee are the more vnacquainted with the cure: And as amongest all the Engi
                     •
                  es that the malice of Man could euer inuent for the ruine of man, Artillery is the cruellest and most dangerous, because that neither strength or policy are able to preuent the fury therof: therefore the Method that reacheth vs to cure those wounds after so easie and excellent a way as is here described, must needs be accounted most needfull and beneficiall. But howsoeuer, I doe not doubt, but that you my kinde friends, who with Galen trauell to benefit your Country, and enrich your experienccs, that you (I say) doe know the vse and necessitie of this subiect. And although there are diuers extant at this time; yet neuerthelesse, this doeth deserue the best place in your good opinions, because that the translation heereof, was first vndertaken for your sakes onely. Farewell.

            The Preface.
            
               BEfore I enter into the Description of Wounds made by Gun-shot, and the Curation of them,Intention of the Author. it seemeth vnto mee to bee very conuenient, (to bring the Reader into an appetite, before I place him at this Table, serued forth in so many seuerall dishes, seasoned with Salt-peter) to discourse heere briefly of the first Inuentors of this so pernicious & dangerous an Instrument of Warre: And into how many kindes it hath beene diuersified and varied, euery kinde thereof hauing a name imposed theron, according to his vse and hurtful quality towards Mankind. Polydorus Virgill in his second Booke of the Inuentors of things, Chap. 2. saith, that Artillery was first inuented by an Alleman of base condition: and that by a sudden and vnexpected Accident. This man borne for the ruine and destruction of Mankind, hauing kept in a Morter for some certaine intention of the aforesaid Powder (which since by reason of the principall vse thereof hath beene called Gunpowder) the which hee couered with a stone: it happened, that in striking of fire with his Steele and Tinder, a small sparke fell into this Morter, and presently the Powder hauing taken fire, the force thereof did beare away the stone with violence; the which did both astonish and amaze him, and also taught

the force of that comixture not knowne before: so that making a little hollow Instrument or Pipe of yron, and composing of the aforesaid Powder, he made tryall of that Engine, and seeing the effect fall out according to his desire,The Venetians had the first vse of Artillery. he first taught vnto the Venetians the vse of this deuillish inuention, in the Warre which they had against the Genowaies in the yeere of our redemption 1380. in a place heretofore called the Clodian Valley, but now Chioggia.
               Diuers opinions touching the time when Artillery began. Neuerthelesse, according to the opinion of Petrus Massa, in the eight Chapter of the first part of his diuers Lessons, this inuention should be more ancient, because that in the Chronicle of Alphonsus the eleuenth King of Castile, who Conquered the Argezirian Iles, It is recorded that in those warres, which was in the yeere 1343. the besieged Moores shot at their enemies out of certaine Mortors of yron the seuerall reports whereof, caused an exceeding horrible sound in the ayre, equall vnto that of Thunder. The Lord Don Pedro, Bishop of Leon, in the Chronicle of King Alphonsus hee that Conquered Toledo, writeth, that in a battell by sea, which was betwixt the king of Tunis, and the King of Seuill, a Moore, (it being foure hundred yeeres agoe and more) whose part the King Alphonsus fauoured: those of Tunis had in their ships certaine Engines of yron or Bombards, with the which they shot against their enemies. By this it appeares that Artillery hath beene heretofore in vse, although it neuer came to perfection till this present. The inuenter of this engine hath had but little recompence, for his name and profession are altogether vnknowen to the world, as being not vnworthy of any memory for such a wicked and damnable inuention. Howbeit Andrew The
                     •
                  et in his Cosmographie speaking of the Sweuians, a people neere about the Low-Countries, writeth out of

the authority of an old written Booke, that the aforesaid German had been in former time a Monke,The Author of Artillery and his name. Philosopher or Alcumist by profession, of the Countrey of Fribourg: his name Constantine Anelzen. Yet howsoeuer this engine was first called Bombard, by reason of the sound that it causeth: which the Latines conformably doe call Bombus. Since the time of the first inuention thereof, being before rude and imperfect: The time; Art,What things hath s
                     •
                  nce bin added to the Artillery. but aboue all, the malice of men haue added much vnto it. For first of all, for the matter it selfe, it being first of yron, they haue since beene cast of Brasse or Copper, Mettals more forcible, and tractable: besides lesse subiect vnto rust. Secondly, at the first they were but simply formed, and as it were but a rude masse of yron; but since they haue beene diuersified into an hundred fashions, yea vnto the mounting of them on wheeles, to the end that they might be caried with the more swiftnesse; and as it were run to the ruine and destruction of men; The first Mortor pieces not being sufficient or cruell enough to vomit forth fire and shot.
            From thence haue proceeded these horrible monsters, as Cannons, doubles Cannons, Bastards, Muskets,Diners names of the Artillery: & whence they are taken Fowlers, and Morter Pieces, &c. These furious beasts of Culuerings, Serpentines, Basilisks, Sakers, Falcons, Falconnets, Chambers, Murderers, and infinite other kindes, all of diuers names, not onely drawne and taken from their figure and qualitie, but also from their effects and cruelty. Wherein truely they shewed themselues wise and vnderstood well the thing they vndertooke. I meane those that first imposed such names which are not onely taken from the most rauenous animals, as from Sakers, & Falcons: but also from the most dangerous enemies of Mankind, as from Serpents, Snakes, and Basiliskes, to

shew, that such Engines haue no other vse; and were not inuented for any other end or intention, but onely to destroy suddenly and cru
                  •
               lly the life of man: and that hearing them onely named, we should haue them in horrour and detestation. I omit to speake of other Pieces lesse in body and substance, but in force and cruelty more dangerous. For so much as they can take away our liues neere at hand, and may surprise vs by treason, being without all meanes of preuention: such are the Pistols, Dags, and such like, which easily may be hidden in a mans pocket. Betwixt these two kindes before spoken of, the Harquebuz of Crocke holds a meane, the which cannot be shot off vnlesse it be first bound or fixed in some peece of wood: the Caliuer which cannot be discharged at the cheeke, by reason of their thicke and short stocks, but are helde against the breast. Also the common Muskets all: which haue beene inuented for the commoditie of footmen for shot and bullets. The generall word imposed by the Latines is Sclopus, through the imitation of the sound, & by the Italians Sclopoterre, by the Frenchmen, Harquebuze, a word also taken from the Italians, by reason of the touch-hole, by which the fire first entreth into the Piece: for the Italians call a hole Buzio▪ and it is called Arc from the word Arcus a bow, because they are vsed at this present instead of bowes formerly vsed in the time of warre. For in former time the Archers held the same Front in the battell,From w

From this miserable shop and Magazin of cruelty haue sprong these Mines, Countermines, Fire bals, Fire pots, burning arrowes, Lances, and Crossebowes, murderers, wilde Fires, and other hellish inuentions, Bags, Traines, Torches, Circles, Oranges, Grenados, Crossebowes, Chaineshot, Winged shot, and such like.

Thus are both the yron and fire armed against vs, to take away our liues through the malice of men, for the conseruation whereof they were at the first created.

And yet neuerthelesse, the ordinary and naturall Thunder is nothing in a maner to these infernall engines: which may easily be comprehended by comparing the effects of the one with the other. Nature would herein-honour and priuiledge man in this aboue all other creatures; for man onely dyeth not alwayes being strooke with Thunder: but to the contrary,How man may be prese

                  . or by not being presently turned by force from that side: but the Artillery spareth man no more then beasts, without discretion on what side soeuer it hapned or strooke,

on what side soeuer it doth reuerse them, it carieth away life and all. There are many remedies to preserue a man from the violence of Thunder.

                  cap. 55. For besides those charmes wherein the ancient Romanes put much confidence, beleeuing that thereby the force of Thunder might be coniured or diuerted. The Thunder-bolts are neuer seene to descend lower then fiue foot into the earth; from thence it commeth that those that are fearefull of Thunder doe make themselues Caues or hollow Vaults in the earth, therein to retire themselues as in a place of saftie. It is said also that the Bay tree is neuer strooke with Thunder,What things are preserued from the force of Thunder. and therefore in times past, and is at this day taken for a victorie. Wherefore the Emperour Tiberius fearing Thunder exceedingly aboue all other things, caused himselfe to be crowned with a wreath of Bayes, at the least sound he heared in the Ayre.
                  Sueto. in Tib.
                I haue reade also that others for the like occasion haue made themselues Tents of the skinnes of Sea-calues, because that this Animall hath this gift in particular, neuer to be touched by Thunder. The Eagle is said also to haue this priuiledge aboue all other foules, neuer to be touched by Thunder, and therefore he is called Iupiters bird, as saith Pliny lib. 2. cap. 54. & 55. But against the Artillery, Charmes, and Incantations preuaile nothing: neither the victorious Bayes, nor the Sea Calfe, nor any thing whatsoeuer: no not an opposed Wall it selfe, of ten foot in thicknesse. Briefly, this sheweth the inuincible fury of Artillery, in respect of Thunder in this. For the Thunder may be dissipated by the ringing of Bels,Artillery driueth away Thunder. the sound of Basons, or by the discharging of Ordinance: For the concussion of the clouds meeting together violently, causeth the Thunder: and by the aforesaid agitation of the Ayre; they are discipated and dispersed. But the fury and pride of Artillery will

not be appeased by any thing whatsoeuer. There are some Times and Regions which are exempt and freed from Thunder;The times which a
                     •
                  e without Thunder. for Thunder was neuer seene in the hart of Winter, nor in the midst of Summer, the which happeneth by two contrary reasons. For in Winter the Aire is very thicke, as also the cloudes; and therefore those exhalations of the earth are easily dispersed and distinguished, being of themselues but cold and glaciall. From thence it commeth to passe that the country of Scithia, and other cold countries thereabouts, as Tartary, Liuonia, Muscouia, Russia, & other neighbor countries are exempt from Thunder, as to the contrary, Egypt is seldom endamaged by Thunder, by reason of the great heat in those part. For the exhalations and vapours of the earth, which are hot and drie: are conuerted through their vehement heat into small cloudes, which haue no force, as saith Pliny. But as the inuention,
                  Lib. 2. cap. 50. so is the tempest and damage of Artillery, dispersed as a contagious pestilence ouer all the earth, and at all times the heauens are sencible of the complaining cryes of those that feele the furious effects thereof. Thunder for the most part hath but one blow, but one bolt, and neuer killeth but one man at a time. But Artillery at one blow will massacre an hundred men. The Thunderbolt oftentimes, as being a naturall thing, falleth as it happeneth, sometimes on a rocke, sometimes on a mountaine, sometimes on a Tower, seldome on a man. But the Artillery,Designe and end of Artillery. being guided by the wicked dexteritie of man, coueteth nothing but man, hath quarrell to none but man, him alone hee slayeth, him alone hee chooseth among a thousand other things. The Thunderbolt doth a good space of time giue vs warning by the voyce of Thunder, the forerunner thereof; to aduertise vs of the ensuing tempest: but the Artillery it striketh in

Thunder, and Thundereth in striking; sending assoone his mortall bullet into the bowels, as he doth his sound into the eares. This is the reason why we do, & that iustly detest the Author of such a hurtfull and pernicious inuention: as to the co
                  •
               trary, we ought to esteeme those worthy of great praises, who either by words haue studied to reuoke all Kings and Princes from the practise of such a miserable inuention, or by effects and writings haue stvdied to ordaine and prescribe remedies to those that haue beene wounded thereby: the consideration whereof hath been a principall motiue to me to write of this matter and subiect. But before my pen shall run in this carriere, I will for the easier vnderstanding of the ensuing Treatise, which I intend to publish,The reason that moued the Authour to write of Gunshot. place two discourses in the beginning of the Booke; to extirpate certaine ancient opinions out of the fantasies of many, which seeme vnto me to be altogether false. VVhich errors vnlesse they are first conuicted; it is impossible to vnderstand any thing of the essence of this euill, or to doe any profitable action in the cure therof.The sum contained in the 1. discourse. The first discourse is addressed vnto the Reader, condemning by manifest reasons, the errors of Vigo, who teacheth to cauterize and burne the wounds made by Gunshot, thinking that they did participate of a certaine venenosity, to the contrary approuing, that those that cure those wounds by suppuratiues, is as salubrious and healthfull at that of Vigo is cruell and dangerous.The sum contained in the 2 discourse. The second discourse is addressed to King Charles the ninth; vpon speciall command from his Maiestie: shewing that the same wounds doe not participate of any venenosity, but that their malignant effects depend wholly on the corruption of the Ayre, and the cacochymie or euil qualitie of the wounded bodies.
         
      
      
         
            
            The first Discourse vpon Wounds made by Gun-shot, and other fierie Engines.
            
               IN the yeere of our Lord, 1536. the victorious King Frances sent a great Army vnto Piedmont to victual Thurin, and to recouer those Townes and Castles which had bene taken by the Marquesse Du Guast, Lieutenant Generall of the Emperor, where Mounsieur the Constable, then Great Master, was Lieutenant generall of the Army, and Mounsieur de Monte-jan captaine generall of the Foote-men (of whom I was then Chirurgian.) A great part of the army arriued at the Pas of Suze,
               
                  Pas of Suze.
                wher we found the enemie keeping the passage, and had made vnto themselues certain Forts and Trenches; in such sort, that before they could be raised from thence, we entred into battell: in which conflict there was many hurt and slaine, as well on the one side as on the other. But they were inforced to quit that passage, and to recouer the Castle; which they helde not long, but were compelled to giue it vp; marching away in their shirts onely, hauing each of

them a white wand in their hands: of whom, the most part went to the Castle de Villane,
               The Castle de Villane besie
                     •
                  ed & taken. where there was about some two hundred Spaniards. To this castle my Lord the Constable drew his forces, beecause he would make his way cleere before him. It is situate vpon a little Mountaine, which giueth great assurance to those within, that there can bee no Ordinance planted against it to batter it down. They were summoned to restore it vp, or else were threatned to haue it battered in pieces; which they flatly refused: answering withal, that they were as good and faithfull seruants to the Emperour, as Mounsieur the Constable was to the King his Master. Their answere being vnderstoode, the same night there was mounted two great Cannons, by the force of armes with ropes and cordes, by the Switzers, where (as mis-fortune would) those cannons being planted, a Gunner by indiscretion fired a barrell of Gun-pouder, wherewith hee himselfe was extreamely burned, together with tenne or twelue souldiers. Moreouer, the flame of the pouder was the cause of the discouery of the Ordinance, whereby those of the castle the night following discharged their Ordinance at that place where they discouered our cannons; in so much, that we had many of our men hurt and slaine.
            The morrow after, very early we began the battery, and in few houres after the breach was made; which those of the castle perceiuing, desired a parley, but it was too late; for in the mean time some of our footmen perceiuing them to be astonished,

mounted the Breach, and entred the castle, putting euery man to the sword, except onely a certaine beautifull Piedmontese, which a great Lorde entertained into his seruice. The Captaine and Ancient were taken aliue, but were presently after hanged on the gate of the Towne, to terrifie the rest of the Emperors souldiers, not to be so foole-hardy to hold such places against so great an Armie. Now the soldiers of the castle seeing our men rushing in vpon them in such great furie, made all the resistance they could to defend themselues, in killing and wounding a great number of our souldiers with their Pikes and Muskets; where the Chirurgians had a great deale of work cut out to their hands.
            I was at that time but a yong Chirurgian,The Author entereth into the matter. and but little experienced in the Art, because I neuer (as yet) had seene the curation of any Woundes made by Gunne-shot. True it is, that I had read Iohn de Vigo his first booke of woundes in generall, chap. 8. where he saith, That those woundes made by fiery Engines, do participate of venenosity, because of the Pouder; and for their curation, hee commandeth to cauterize them with the Oyle of Elders mixed with a little Treacle: yet neuerthelesse, because I would not be deceiued, before I would vse of the aforesaid boyling oyle, knowing that it brought with it extreame paine to the Patient, I obserued the method of the other Chirurgians in the first dressing of such wounds; which was by the application and infusion of the aforesaide

Oyle as hot as possibly they could suffer it, vvith Tents and Setons: wherefore, I became emboldned to do as they did. But in the end my oyle fayled mee,A remedie found by accident. so that I was constrained to vse in steede thereof, a digestiue made of the yolke of an Egge, Oyle of Roses and Terebinth. The night following, I could hardly sleepe at mine ease, fearing lest that for want of cauterizing, I should find my Patients on whom I had not vsed of the aforesayde Oyle, dead and impoysoned; which made mee to rise earely in the morning to visit them: where beyond my expectation, I found those on whom I had vsed the digestiue Medicine, to feele but little paine, and their wounds without inflammation or tumor, hauing rested well all that night. The rest, on whom the aforesaide Oyle was applyed, I found them inclining to Feauers, with great pain, tumor, and inflammation about their Woundes: then I resolued with my selfe, neuer to burn so cruelly the wounded Patients by Gunshot any more.
            When we entred Thurin, I was told of a Chirurgian who was exceeding famous, especially for his curing wounds made by Gun-shot, with whom I found the meanes to acquaint my selfe: yet it was neere two yeeres and a halfe before hee would acquaint me with his Medicine which hee called his Balme. In the meane time, Mounsieur the Marshall of Monte-jan, who was Lieutenant Generall of the King in Piedmont died: then I tolde this Chirurgian, that I had a desire to returne to Paris, withall requesting him, that he would perform his

promise; which was, to giue me the receipt of his Balme, which he willingly did, seeing that I was to leaue that country. He sent me to fetch him two yong whelpes, one pound of earth-wormes, two pounds of the oyle of Lillies, six ounces of the Terebinth of Venice, and one ounce of Aqua-vitae: and in my presence he boiled the whelpes aliue in the saide Oyle, vntill the flesh departed from the bones. Afterward, he tooke the wormes (hauing before killed and pu

               ified them in white wine, to purge themselues of the earth which they haue alwayes in their bodies:) being so prepared, he boyled them also in the said Oyle till they became dry, this he strained thorough a Napkin, without anie great expression; that done, hee added thereto the Terebinth, and lastly, the Aqua-vitae; and called God to witnesse, that this was his Balme which he vsed in all wound
                  •
                made by Gun-shot, and in others which required suppuration; withall praying me not to divulge his secret.
            From thence I returned to Paris, where shortly after Mounsieur Siluius Lecturer of the King in Physicke, a man greatly esteemed among learned mē, requested me one day to dine with him, which I did willingly; where hee asked me many Questions, and among the rest, of the essence of wounds made by Gun-shot, and of the combustions made by Gun-pouder. Whereupon, I presently proued vnto him, that the powder was not any thing venomous at all;Gunpouder not venomous. because that no Simple that entreth therein is any way venomous, much lesse the composition.

Also I haue seene by experience, that some souldiers being hurt, will take of the sayde powder in Wine, saying; That powder so taken, doth preserue the body from the ensuing accidēts, the which I approue not. Also others hauing vlcers on their bodies, do commonly vse of the saide powder dry, and heale them without any danger at all. And as for the Bullets they cannot containe any such heate that they should haue the faculty of burning: for a bullet beeing shot against a stonewall, it may presently be held in the naked hande, although the collission made against the Stones,Woundes made by gu

A certaine boy of the Kitchin, of Mounsieur the Marshall de Monte-jan, fell into a Caldron full of Oyle almost boyling hotte; to dresse whom being sent for, I went presently to an Apothecarie, demanding of him such cooling Medicines which are commonly applied vnto burnings: an ancient country-woman being by, hearing mee speake of this burning, counselled me to apply for the first dressing (to preuent the rising of Pustules or bladders) of raw Onions, bruised with a little salt. I demanded of this woman whether shee had euer made experience of that Medicine before: she presently sware vnto me in her language,

hereof on this Scullion of the kitchin, where truely I found the morrow after, that in those parts where the Onions had touched, to bee altogether free from vessickes or blisters, and the other parts where the Onions were not applied, to bee much blistered.

                  ie. hauing drunke hard, by indiscretion set his Flaske afire, which caused a great disaster both to his hands and face; and being called to dresse him, I applyed of the saide Onions on the one halfe of his face; and on the other side, of other common remedies. At the second dressing, I founde that part vvhere I had applyed the Onions to be altogether without blisters or any excorlation, and the other altogether blistred: then I first purposed to write of the effect of the saide Onions.
            Moreouer, I tolde vnto the saide Syluius,

                  tuate in the extraction of Bullets. that for the better extraction of bullets which are hidden in anie part of the bodie, it is requisite the patient should be placed in the same situation that he was in at that time when he was wounded. Manie other things I discouered vnto him, which are contained in this Booke following. My discourse ended, he prayed mee verie earnestly that I would publish it by writing; to the end, that that false opinion of Vigo might be altogether abollished the which I willingly consented vnto, and caused manie instruments to be cut, such as had not bene divulged, for the extraction of bullets, & other vnnatural

things out of the bodie. And it was first imprinted in the yeare 1545. and well receiued, which caused me to renew it againe, and publish it the second time, in the yeare 1552. and lastly, in the yeare 1564. where I haue enriched it with manie other things, because I haue since followed the warres, haue bene in many battels, and besiedged Townes, as in Metz and Hedin. Also I haue beene entertained into the seruice of fiue Kings, where I haue alwayes discoursed with the most excellent Physitians & Chirurgians of those times, to learne and discouer if there were any other Method or way to cure those wounds made by Gunne-shot; whereof the most part (especially those that haue followed the warres, and are guided by reason and experience) are of my opinion, which is to vse Suppuratiues in the beginning, and not boyling oyles. And I did protest moreouer to the said Syluius, that I haue found those woundes as easie to cure (being in fleshy parts) as all other great contused wounds are. But where the bullet meeteth with the bones and neruous parts, it teareth, dilacerateth, breaketh,The cause that maketh woundes by Gunne shot hard to bee cured. breaketh, and shiuereth in peeces, not only where it toucheth, but also the circumiacent parts, without any mercy; causing great accidents which happen specialy in the iounctures or ioynts, and in bodies of euill constitution, and in times subiect to corruption; that is to say, where the ayre is hot and moist, then is the cure most difficult, & oftentimes impossible; not only of wounds made by Gun-shot, but also of those which are made by

other instruments, yea, though they were but in fleshy parts.
            Therefore, the aforesaide accidents doe not proeeede from the venenosity which is in the powder, or by the combustion or burning of the Bullet. For proofe whereof,History. I will alledge this obseruation which I haue experimented not long since on the person of the Earle of Courdon, Lord of Achindon, a Scottishman, whome I cured by the commandement of the Queene-mother, who was hurt with the shot of a Pistoll cleane through both the Thighes, without fracture of the bones; he standing so neere the mouth of the Pistoll, that the fire tooke hold of his breeches; neuerthelesse, hee was perfectly cured in two and thirty dayes, without a Feauer or any other euill accident. I drest him at Sir Iohn de Latran, in the house of the Arch-byshoppe of Glasco, then Ambassador for Scotland, who came euerie day to see him drest. Moreouer for testimony, I could produce Mounsieur Brigard, Doctor Regent in the Facultie of Physicke, who was an assistant with me: together with Iames Guillemean Chirurgian to the King, & sworne at Paris, who was with mee vntill his perfect curation. The same likewise Mounsieur Hanti

                  , Doctor Regent in the faculty of Physicke can testifie, who sometimes came to see him. Also Giles Buzet, Scotchman and Chirurgian, euerie of them meruailing how he became so soone cured without the application of hot and sharp Medicines. Now the reasons wherfore I haue made

this little Discourse, is to demonstrate that it is aboue thirty yeares ago, since I first found out this manner of curing wounds made by Gunne-shot, without the vse of boyling Oyles, or anie other sharpe or burning Medicines, vnlesse I was constrain'd to vse them for such accidents which happened in Cacochymed bodies, or through the euill disposition and malignancie of the ayre, as I will shew more amply in this Discourse following, which I made vnto the deceased King, after the taking of Roan.

                  ion.I know that this following discourse will astonish some, who reposing themselues vppon their owne particular opinions, and not examining the matter deepely, will finde the first front of my disputation very strange, because that the contrarie hath beene so long imprinted in their fantasies. For I do hold, that the cause of the malignancy of wounds by Gun-shot, not to proceed from anie poison or venomous quality in the powder (as they imagine) or from the bullet it selfe, beeing rubbed or infused in any venomous mixture. Neuerthelesse, if their meekenesse and patience will extend so far, as first to waigh the motiues which first mooued me to vndertake this subiect, which was a zeal of the publike good; towards the which the Law of Nature bindeth mee to shew the vtmost of my power in such things which the singular prouidence of God hath reuealed vnto mee.

To preuent therefore all the arguments of venome and poisoning, which the aduersaries here aboue mentioned may alledge, I will make it plaine vnto your Maiesty, that such as are wounded by gun-shot,The Author proposeth two points, whi

                     •
                  e wold refute. viz. the poyson of the powder and the Fire of the Bullet. I say the malignancie of such wounds not to proceed from the venom of the Powder, being of it selfe simply considered: and much lesse from the combustion or cauterization which the Bullet so heated by the fire of the powder can make in those parts, which it rendeth & dilacerateth thorough the violence thereof: although neuerthelesse some do striue to maintaine; alledging for all reasons, that a certaine Tower full of powder hath heeretofore bene seene ruinated in an instant, onely by the meanes of a Cannon shotte. Also of a Thatcht house set on fire with a Musket shot. Moreouer, because that such woundes which are made by Gun-shot, we commonly beholde their Orifices and other circumiacent parts so black, as if an actuall Cauter had passed thereon. As also the fall of a certaine escarre, as they say. Al which arguments are so ill framed, that they deserue no authority being built on so slender a foundation: much lesse that the resolution of your demaund

should be taken from them, as I trust to giue you plainely to vnderstand in the disputation following. The which (after I had seene a great number of those woundes, and diligently obserued them, handling them according to the Method) I haue collected from the ancient Philosophers, Physitians,The prese
                     •
                  t disputation is taken frō Philosophers, Physitians, and Chirurgians and Chirurgians to present vnto your Maiesty, and to with-draw your minde from the admiration of the lamentable deaths of so manie braue Gentlemen and Soldiers.
            Now to enter into the matter proposed, and to answer the arguments before alledged, we are first to examine whether there be any poison inclosed in the powder, or no: And if there be, whether it may infect by meanes of the pretended poyson thereof. Which that it may appeare plainly, wee must search into the composition of the said pouder; considering that it is not of substance simple, but compound: and so by examining the nature of such Simple which enter into the composition thereof; I meane their qualities, effects, and operations, wee shall the sooner attaine to the scope and intention pretended.
            As for the Simples, it is a most assured thing that there are but three in al which make the composition thereof,The composition of the powder. that is to say, Coales of Willow or Birch, Sulphure, and Salt-peter, & sometimes Aqua-vitae: the which ingredients seuerally considered, are altogether exempt & free from poison, or any venomous quality. And first for the coales, there is not any thing considerable in

them, vnlesse it be a drying quality, of subtle substance, by meanes whereof it is apt to take fire, euen as a Linnen cloth burnt into Tinder doth the sparkes that fall from a Flint stone. Sulphure is hot and dry, neuerthelesse not excessiue, and of a more oyly and viscuous substance, yet not so easie to inflame as coales, although it doth retaine the fire more forcibly when it is once inflamed, & is very hardly extinguished. As for the Salt-peter, it is such,Salt-peter is salt of stones. that many make vse thereof insteede of salt. Now let vs examine whether there be any venenosity in the nature of these Simples, namely, in that of Sulphure, which is the most suspected. Dioscorides in his fift Booke, chap. 37. prescribeth it to be taken in an Egge, in the astmaticke passion, coughes, and to such which spit matter, and those that haue the Iaundise. And Galen in the 9. Book of his Simples, Cap. 36. ordaineth it as a topicall remedy, vnto such who are bitten with venomous beasts; and in all malignant practises or itchings; as for the Aquavitae, it is a thing so subtle, that it will euaporate if it be set in the aire, besides it is vsed by most Chirurgians inwardlie in drinkes, and outwardly in embrocations as a most singular Medicines. These thinges considered, makes me to affirme, that the whole composition of pouder is altogether free from venome or poison, seeing that the ingredients are altogether cleere from the least touch in that kinde. Moreouer, I haue obserued it to bee the practise of the Hollanders being wounded by Gun-shot, to dissolue

two charges of pouder in wine, and to drink it off, hoping by that meanes to be freed from all future accidents which might happen vnto theyr wounds (although I do not approue thereof, because it is a most insufficient remedy.) Also, such Vlcers which are made through the combustion of powder, are of no other nature then those that are made by fire, or scalding water. But wherefore should I alledge any forraigne example? Do we not see among our owne souldiers, I doe not know on what occasion, but onely to shew themselues braue fellowes, to emptie their charges of powder into their cups, and drinke it without any inconuenience at all; and others likewise beeing hurt on any part of their bodies, will apply of the same on their Vlcers to dry them, and finde much profit by it.Refutation of those that affirme the Bullet to be impoisoned. As for those which do affirme that it is not in the powder, but the Bullet, which being subtilly pierced in many places, or filled vp with venome, or steeped, rubbed, or mixed with anie poyson, causeth the aforesaide dangerous accidents? To such I answer without further trouble, that the fire set to the powder, is sufficient to purifie the poyson of the Bullet, if any there were▪ the which cānot be done by impoysoned swords, Pikes, Arrowes, and such like, because they passe not through the action of the fire. Briefly to confirme my opinion to be true, there is not anie one of those that were in your Maiesties Camp
                  •
                at Roan, that doeth not assuredly know, that those Bullets which were shot against those of the town

to be altogether free from poison. Neuerthelesse, the besiedged Townesmen affirmed, that all those Bullets were poysoned. Also the Souldiours of your Maiesties Campe had the same opinion of such Bullets which were shot at them out of the Towne, that they were all impoysoned by them; rather beleeuing and iudging of the quality of the wounds by their ill successe; then by the Causes whereby they were made.
            True it is, that as in Physicke according to the sentence of Hippocrates in the Epidemies; as Gale
                     •
                  
                noteth on the 20. sentence, and the 71. of the 3 Sect. of the 3. Book, all diseases are cald Pestilentiall and venomous, being excited from common and generall causes of what kinde soeuer they be, and such kill many persons: so in the like manner, we may cal such wounds which are made by gunshot venomous, which are more difficult to heale then others; not because they do participate of any venonosity, but from some generall cause depending either from the Cacochimie of the body, putrification of the aire, or the corruption of the victuals, whereby those Vlcers are brought to be more malignant Cacoëthes, and rebellious to al Medicines.
            To affirme that it is only the combustion of the Bullet which causeth the aforesaide danger,Refutation of those that affirme that the Bullet causeth cō
                  bustion. I cannot conceiue their reasons, seeing that the Bullet is for the most part made but of Lead, and therefore vnable to indure any great heate, without being altogether dissolued, the which we neuerthelesse

see to passe through a coate Armour, and to penetrate the body through and through, and yet to remaine whole. Moreouer, we doe obserue, that if a Bullet be shot against a stone, or against any solid matter, it may in the same instant bee handled of vs in our hands, without feeling anie notable heate, although the violent striking and colli
                  •
               sion made against the stone, should in reason encrease the hea
                  •
               e, if any there were. And which is more, if a Bullet be shot against a bagge full of powder, the fire will not endanger it. This I dare bee bolde to say and affirme moreouer, that if a quantity of powder should take fire being kepte in a Tower, or any other place, by the meanes of a Bullet shot, it was not the heate of the Bullet, but rather the violent striking of the Bullet against the stones of the saide Tower, which might cause sparkes of fire to fall among the powder, euen as the smiting of a steele against a flint stone. The like we may iudge of such Thatcht houses which haue bene set on fire by a Musket shot, to haue rather proceeded from some wad either of Tow or Paper, ram'd in with the powder, and so fired with it. But that which doth most confirme me in the assurance of my opinion, is, that if a bal of wax be shot out of a Muske
                  •
               ,An example of a ball of wax. it feeleth no force of fire at all, for then it would melt; neuerthelesse it wil pierce an inch boord. An argument of sufficient weight to proue that the Bullet cannot be so extreamely heated by the force of the Powder, that they should cauterize and burne, as many haue esteemed.

And as for that blacknesse, which is ordinarily found to bee about the Orifices of such wounds, and other ad
                  •
               acent parts. I say that this accident doeth not proceede from any qualitie of fire accompanying the Bullet, but because of the great contusion which it maketh.Whence it p

                  dinarily blacke. For it cannot enter into the body otherwise then by an extreme and incredible force, because it is of a rounde figure. Vpon this point, if the wounded persons themselues be demanded, I beleeue they will testifie the truth of my saying; because they are no sooner strooke with the bullet, but they feel in the same instant, as if a club or some heauie burthen were fallen vpon the offended part, in the which they feele a heauy paine, with a benummed stupifaction of the part; which dissipateth and sometimes extinguisheth the naturall heate, together with the spirits contained therein: from whence there followeth oftentimes a Gangrene and mortification of the part, yea sometimes of the whole body. And as for the Escarre which they affirme there to be, and fall away as they say, they doe abuse themselues: for it is onely some certain portion of the Membranes and contused flesh, dilacerated by the Bullet, which becommeth corrupted, and so separateth it selfe from the sound parts which are greatly contused.
            Although that these Reasons do make it manifest enough,Reasons of those of contra
                     •
                  y opiniō
                that there is no venomous quality in the powder, nor action of fire carried with the Bullet, neuerthelesse many building their opinions

vpon naturall Philosophy, doe maintaine the contrary, affirming that Cannon shot is like vnto the claps of Thunder which burst foorth of the clouds in the middle Region of the aire▪ and so fall violently on the earth. From the which similitude they would infer and conclude, that there is both fire, and a venomous quality in the Bullet, as it proceedeth out of the mouth of the Cannon. I know (I thanke God) that Thunder being ingendered from a grosse and viscuous exhalation, by meanes of vapour conioyned with it, doth neuer breake foorth of the clouds to penetrate heere below, but it draweth and bringeth immediatly with it a certaine fire, sometimes more subtle, sometimes more grosse, according to the diuersitie of the matter, whereof the exhalation is composed. For Seneca writeth in the second booke of his naturall questions,Seneca. 3. kindes of Thunders. chapter 49. that there are three kinds of Thunders all differing the one from the other, according to the quantity and manner of their inflammation. The first, by reason of the matter thereof, it being most thinne and subtle, it doth pierce and penetrate suddenly the Obiectes which it toucheth. The second kinde, by reason of the violence thereof, breaketh and dissipateth the same thinges because that the matter thereof is more violent, and compact as a Tempest. The third sort being composed of a more earthy matter, burneth with manifest tokens of the heat therof. I also know, that the Thunder is of nature Pestilentiall and faetide, because of the grosse and slimie

matter thereof; which being burned, leaueth behinde it such a stinking sauour, that all animals do so much auoide it, that if it do happen to fall into their dens, or other places of haunt, they wil vtterly abandon and forsake such places; so much do they hate the infectious stinke of that poyson.

For all these reasons, I must not confesse that the blowes of Gun-shot are accompanied with poyson and fire, as the claps of Thunder a

What if I should be conuicted by stronger arguments, so that I were inforced to anouch that▪ Thunder and the Cannon to be of like substance; yet I shoulde neuer be forced to say, that the shot of Cannons and Muskets do participate of a fiery quality. Pliny saith in the second Book of his History, and the

51. chapter, that among Thunder one kinde is composed of a meruailous dry matter, dissipating all such thinges it meeteth withall, neuerthelesse without any signe of burning: others, of a more humid nature, which in like manner burneth not: but blacketh and discoloureth much more then the first. And others are composed of a very cleere and subtle matter: the nature wherof is most meruailous, forsomuch that it is not to bee doubted (as Seneca hath well saide) that there is therein a certaine divine vertue:A meruailous effe

Also in melting a sworde, the scabberd thereof remayning whole. Also in dissoluing into droppes the Iron head of a Pike, without burning, or so much as heating the woode. In shedding the wine out of a vessell, without burning or breaking of the caske. According to the aforesaid testimony I can assure you, and that without any preiudice, that those Thunders which onely breake and dissipate without any burning; and such which leaue effects ful of great admiration, not to be much vnlike in substance to the Cannon shot, and not those which carry immediately with them the action of fire. To proue my saying, this one example shall suffice.Example. A certaine souldier receiued a wound in his Thigh with a Musket shot, from when I extracted a bullet; the which being wrapped in the Taffatie of his breeches, made a very deepe wound. Neuerthelesse I drew it forth of the wound with the

same Taffatie, it being without any signe of burning.
            And which is more, I haue seene many men, who not being shot, nor any thing touched therewith, vnlesse it were in their apparrell onely, haue receiued such an astonishment by a Cannon shot that onely past neere them, that their members thereby haue become blacke and liuid; and shortly after haue falne into a Gangrene and mortification, whereof in the end they haue died.
            These effects are like vnto those of the thunder before spoken of. Neuerthelesse, there is not in them any fire or poison: which maketh mee conclude, that there is no poison in the common and ordinary pouder. Seeing therefore that this disaster was common to all those which were hurt in these last warres, and yet neither by fire or poyson that so many valiant men died. To what cause may we impute this euill? I am so confident of the true cause my Liege, that I hope presently to make your Maiesty vnderstand the same, to the end that your demand may be fully satisfied.

substances are chaunged by rarification or condensation of themselues; so the fire doth conuert it selfe ordinarily into aire, the aire into water, the water into earth; and contrarywise the earth into water, the water into aire, and the ai
                  •
               e into fire. The which we may dayly behold and proue it by those bellowes of Copper which the Dutchman brings vs, being composed in the form of a Boll, the which being filled with water, and hauing but one hole in the midst of the Sphericall forme thereof, receiueth the transmutation of the water within it into aire through the action of the Fire, neere vnto the which the Boll must be placed; and so thrusteth the aire forth of it with violence, making a continuall noise or sound vntill all the ayre be gone forth of it. The like may bee knowne by Egges or Chestnuts: for either of them being put into the fire before they are crackt, or the Rindes broken, presently the watery humidity contained in them doth conuert it selfe into ayre, thorough the action of the fire: and the aire in making his passage bursteth the shell, beecause it occupyeth more place being in the forme of aire, into the which it was chaunged by rarification caused by the fire, then it did vnder the forme of water; and not finding passage is constrained to make one by violence, according to the proposition helde for most certaine among all Physitians; that is to say, of that one part of Earth is made tenne of water: and of one part of water is made ten of aire, as of one part of aire ten of fire. I do say and affirme so

much of the matters contained in the saide Gun-powder, which by meanes of the fire is conuerted into a great quantity of aire; the which because it cannot be contained in the place where the matter was before the tran

Euen as we see a Bow, or a Sling shoote forth an arrow or stone, without any aire at all. But the bullet driueth before it such a subtle winde, and so swiftly agitated that sometimes the very wind it selfe without the action of the bullet causeth strange and wonderfull effects. For sometimes I haue known it make a fracture in the bones without any diuision of the flesh.The effect

As it is reported by one, who had heard a voice (as it were) of a woman a beating,Diuers sounds yssuing out of the veins of the earth. which made (as he imagined) such a wofull and greeuous lamentation, whereby he became so greatly affrighted, that hee had scarsely breath sufficient to make this report.

into the which the diuine prouidence is infused; which changeth the aire at his pleasure, & giueth it power not onely ouer the mutation of times & seasons, but also of the alteration of naturall bodies. And therefore the Philosophers and Physitians haue expresly commanded, that wee should haue a principall regarde vnto the situation and motions of the heauenly bodies, and constitutions of the aire, when the preseruation of health, or the curation of diseases are in question: but especially the course and mutation of the Aire is of great power, as we may easily iudge by the 4. seasons of the yeare.

And therefore we should of necessity consider in all diseases, and the inconueniences which happen therein, the quality of the windes and the power which they haue ouer our bodies; as Hippocrates hath learnedly left vs by writing, in the 3. Booke of his Aphorismes, Chap. 5. and 17. saying, That our bodies do receiue a great alteration through the vissitude of the times and seasons of the yeere. As by the South-wind our bodies are subiect to all diseases, because that moisture is their primitiue cause▪ it also weakeneth our naturall heate, the which in the opposite case is much fortified through a cold and dry wind, which also maketh our spirits more quicke and subtill.

It being so that for these 3. yeares space heere in France, the seasons of euerie yeare haue not kept their ordinary qualities. In the Sommer we haue had but little heate, in the Winter a little or no cold at all.

In like manner, in wounds of Cacochymed bodies, there can be no regeneration made of any good substance, because that to restore a lawdable flesh in the wounded part, it is required that the bloode should not offend neither in quantity nor quality, and that the offended part be in its naturall temperature. All these things wer wanting in the times of these last warres: and therefore it is not to be wondred at, if the wounds which were then receiued (althogh they were but small and of little consequence in the noble or ignoble partes) haue brought with them so many tedious accidents, and in the end death; because that the air

Wounds. with a meruailous stinking sauour. And moreouer there happened vnto them many Aposthumes in diuers parts of their bodies opposite to their hurtes. For, if they were shot in the right shoulder, they should haue an Apostume on the left knee; and if the wound were in the right leg, the Apostume would arise in the left arme.

               CHAP. I. The diuision of woundes, according to the diuersitie both of the offended parts, & the Bullets whereby they were made.
               
                  ALl Wounds made by Gunshot on the body of man, whether they be simple, or compounded with dilaceration, contusion, distemperature, and tumor, are made some in the noble parts, others in the ignoble parts; some in the fleshie parts, and others in the Neruous and bony parts; sometimes with ruption and dilaceration of the great vessels, as of the Veines and Arteries, and sometimes without ruption of them. Such kinde

of wounds are also sometimes superficiall, but most commonly profound and deepe, yea,Differenc

               Another diuersity is taken according to the differences of the Bullets: amongest the which, some are great, some in a meane substance, and some are small as Haile shot: whereof the matter (which is ordinarily but of Lead) is somtimes turned into Steele, Iron, or Tin, rarely into Siluer, but neuer into Gold. According to the which differences, the Chirurgian ought to take diuers Indications to operate, and according to them to diuersifie the remedies. Now we ought not to iudge those great accidents which happen in these wounds to proceede from the combustion of the Bullet, nor from the venonosity or other ill quality of the ponder, because of the aforesaide Reasons alledged in the precedent Discourses, but because of the contusion, dilaceration, and fraction which is made thorough the violence of the Bullet in the neruous and bony parts. For when it hapneth that the Bullet toucheth onely but the fleshy parts, and in bodies of good temperature,F

Wherein I protest I haue followed the counsel of Physitians and people of my profession, such as were most renowned and approoued both by their doctrine and long experience: concerning whom I doe assure my selfe, that they do know more then my writinges can containe. And therefore I write not for them, but for the yong Prentises in this Art, & for such as want better meanes to helpe them in vrgent cases proceeding from these saide wounds, whome neuerthelesse I aduise to take the counsell of the Chirurgian, if his owne reason and experience do not guide him in his operations.
            
            
               CHAP. II. Of the signes of wounds made by Gunshot.
               IN the beginning of the Curation, you ought first to know whether the wounds was made by Gun-shot or no; which is easie to be seene if the figure of the wound be round and

and the naturall colour of the part is chaunged, that is to say, yellow, azure, liuid, or blacke. Also at the same instant that the patient receyued the blow, if he say that he felt an agrauating pain, as if he had beene strooke with a great stone, or with a club, or as if a great burthen had falne vpon the wounded part. In like manner, if the wound hapned not vppon any great vessell, if there haue issued but little blood from the wounded partes, which happeneth because they are contused, and greatly crushed, and therefore they tumifie presently after the blowe receyued; insomuch, that sometimes the passage is so stopt, that there can hardly be conueyed in either tent or Se

                  ment impulsion of the ayre, with the ruption of the flesh and neruous partes. Sometimes also because of the fractured Bones, which depresse and pricke the sayde parts; from whence ensueth fluxion and inflammation. Also because of the great contusion which the Bullet maketh; which by no meanes can enter into anie part of our body but by great force, by reason of the round figure thereof, whereby the place becommeth blacke, and the neighboring partes liuid: and from thence there followeth many great accidents; as Paine, Fluxion, Inflammation, Apostume,

                  etide which proceedeth from the great abundance of humors which flow to the wounded part, because of the vehement crushing, contusion, and dilaceration of the parts, and for want of natural heat to comfort and gouerne them. Also by reason of the Cacochimy of the body, and the neruous partes, as the ioynts: also such wounds are founde for the most part greater then such which are made by the punction of a Buckes horne, or the Wound made by a stone or any other such like Contusions, because that the thing it selfe was round, anb doth therfore require a greater and more violent impetuosity to make it penetrate into the inward parts of the body, wherein it seemeth to equallize the blowes of thunder.
            
            
               CHAP. III. The manner how to handle the aforesaide woundes at the first dressing.
               FIrst, it is conuenient that the Chirurgian shold amplifie the wound (if the part offended doe permit the same) for these causes: that is, both to giue free 
                     •
                  ssue vnto the Sanies, as also to giue ample passage vnto all such straunge bodyes which might haue bene conueyed in with the shot, and to draw them forth (if any there be) as any portion of the apparrell, wad, paper, peeces of Harnesse,

Maile, Bullets, Shot, Splinters of bones, dilacerated flesh, and other things that shall bee found therein; and this to bee done at the first dressing if it be possible. For the accidents of pain and sensibility are not so great in the beginning, as they are afterwards.

But if the bullet haue pierced farre into the body, there it may be reached with a Probe, round in the end thereof, for feare of causing paine: neuerthelesse it hapneth somtimes that the Bullet cannot be found by the Probe, as it hapned in the campe of Parpignan, to my Lord the Marshall of Brissac, who was wounded with a Musket shot neere to the right Omopl

In which place, incision was made to draw forth the shot, whereby he was shortly after cured. Wherefore it is very conuenient to search for the Bullet not onely with the Probe, but (as I saide before) with the fingers, by handling and feeling the part and places about the same where you may coniecture the Bullet to haue penetrated

               The Instruments which follow are Needles for the Seton, and are very conuenient when as you would passe in a Seton to keepe the wound & the way of the Bullet open, vntill you haue drawne forth all the straunge bodies which might yet remaine therein; besides, they may serue to explora

                  sse,Of what bignes the Probes ought to be. pollished and round on their extreamities, because that the edges of the wound, and

the way whereby the Bullet hath passed, doeth incontinently ioyne together, and touch the one side against the other. In such maner that the sayd wound or way of the Bullet, will appeare in sight to be much smaller then it is: and for that cause those Probes which are slender and sharp, are nothing so commodious; for they will stop and stay on euery part of the reioyned wound, and cannot so easily be conducted to the place where the bullet is, as those which are somewhat greater. Also those which are small and slender▪ doe pricke and offend the flesh of the wound whereby the Patient is much mollested, and is oftentimes a cause that the Bullet cannot be found. Also you ought in like manner to haue those which are greater & longer to passe through the thigh when necessity shall require. Which length of them ought to be changed and diuersified according to the greatnesse of the wounded member. For I am of this opinion, that one should not striue too much to make them passe alwayes thorough the wounded parts for feare of induring paine and other accidents. For the Patient may be cured as well although the Seton be not passed thorough, as by experience it hath beene seene, that a Bullet hath bene shot through the body, and yet without the passing through of a Seton, they haue neuerthelesse bene cured.

For those which are to bee taken inwardly ought to be administred by the counsel & ordinance of the learned Physitian, to whose doctrine I leaue all that may appertaine both to the manner of liuing, and the purgation of the Patient. But as for the topical medicines, the Chirurgian (acc
                     •
                  rding to the things aforesaid) ought to consider of the constitution of the times, and of the aire. For if there bee no danger of the part to fall into a Gangrena, he shall vse suppuratiues, as in contused wounds, which are Oleum Catellorum or of a digestiue, hauing a regard to the nature of the part, because that the neruous parts doe require Medicines more drying, then the fleshye parts do. For in the ioynts and neruous parts, you may vse of the Terebinth of Venice, or the Oyle of waxe, of Masticke, the yolkes of Egges, adding thereto a little Aqua-vitae rectified. Such

like things haue power to disiccate and consume the watrish humidity which issueth from the neruous parts, and a

This vnguent when and as often as it shall be needfull may bee applyed with Tents or Setons, beeing first dissolued with a little wine or Aqua-vitae: The which tents ought to be both great and long for the first dressing, thereby to inlarge and dilate the wound that the Medicines may therby the better be conveyed in. But afterwards they ought not to be applyed so long or great. Also that the Medicine may the better be conueyed into the bottome of the wounds, it may bee incited in with a Syringe. Moreouer the vertue and strength thereof shalbe diminished according to the temperature of the body, and sensibility of the hurt. As if the wound be in the neruous parts, it shall be mixed with the Oyles of Terebinth, or of Hypericon, in such quantity

as the expert Chirurgian shall know to bee needfull. But the Egyptiacum is not to bee vsed at all, vnlesse it bee in such times which are Pestilentiall and dangerous for those saide wounds, & that they do decline to putrifaction. After the vse of Egyptiacum you may separate & make the escharre fall, with remollitiue and lenitiue things, as the following Oyle in vsing thereof a litle hotter then luke-warme.

The said Oyle is of great & meruellous efficacy, both to appease the paine, as also to suppurate the wound, and to make the escharre fall. But for want thereof this which followeth may be applied which is easier to be had.

I haue knowne that the saide Oyles being applied in the beginning of the hurt reasonable warme to appease the paine, to lubrifie, relaxe, and moysten the edges of the wound, disposing it to suppuration, which is the true way to cure those woundes, as Galen himselfe reciteth from Hippocrates, saying; That if the flesh bee contused, crushed, or battered with any Dart, or in any other manner, that it ought so to be handled that it bee brought

to suppuration as soone as may bee: For by this meanes the wound shall bee the lesse mollested with Phlegmon (or inflammation.) Also it is necessary that the contused flesh be putrified, liquefied, and conuerted into pus, that new flesh may afterwards be regenerated.
               
                  Ioubertus doth very much approoue this remedy, which I neuer yet did experiment, and it this.

Experience doeth shew that this remedy is excellent, and reason doth also confirm it. For the powder of Mercury accompanyed with vnctious and moistning things, causeth the contused flesh to suppurate easily, & in short time without induring any great paine. As for the Camphire, whether it bee hot or cold, it serueth greatly because of the excellent tenuitie of the parts thereof. By reason wherof, euery Medicine of what quality soeuer it be, doth penetrate, and disperse the Vertues thereof the better. Moreouer,The vertue of Campher the saide Camphire doth resist all putrifaction.

Also they do constipate the skin, which is a hinderance to the transpiration of the fuliginous vapors: from whence ensueth Gangrena and mortification, thorough the vnfit application of such like medicines. VVhere the contusion shall bee great, there you may make many scarifications, therby to discharge the part of the bruised bones which is subiect to putrifie: but in the neighbouring parts, and about the contusion farre off from the wound, you ought to apply cooling & corroborating medicines to prohibite and hinder the defluxion of Humours as is this.

               AT the second dressing, and in the rest following, if there be no danger of putrifaction and Gangrena, you may vse one of the aforesaid oiles adding thereunto of the Egges, with a little Saffron, which shall bee continued vntill the excrement of the wound bee digested and brought to suppuration. Heerein it is to be noted, that in wounds made by Gunne-shot,Pu

                      is not so made by Gunshot, as in all other wounds. it is longer before they bee brought to suppuration then other wounds made by other instruments, because that the bullet and the aire which it thrusteth before

it, dissipateth (by reason of the great Contusion thereof) the naturall heate, and the spirites from the part, which causeth that the concoction is neither so soone, nor so well made, for want of naturall heate, from whence there followeth an exceeding foetide or stinking sauour of the Sanies and other accidents very dangerous. Neuerthelesse it is for the most part made in three or foure dayes, sometimes also sooner or later according to the temperature of the body, and of the part, & the quality of the aire hot or cold. These thinges done, it shall be needfull to begin to mundify by little and little the wound, by adding to the aforesaide Medicine, of Terebinth washed in Rose water or Barly water, or such like, thereby to take away the heate and mordacity thereof. If the disposition of the time be very cold, then you may adde vnto it of Aquavitae, according to the counsell of Galen, who teacheth that in winter ought to be applied hotter medicines then in sommer. Afterwards you may vse of this Mundificatiue,

And therfore the Chirurgian need not to feare any thing at all,Aduertisement to the young Chirurgian. of the closing or conglutinating of the aforesaide wounds, because that the flesh being so greatly contused and dilacerated, cannot consolidate vntill the contusion be first suppurated and mundified.

                  nts. The vse of Tents and Setons is to carry the medicine vnto the bottom of

the wounds, and to keepe them open, especially in their Orifices, vntill that the strange and vnnaturall things be expelled: but if the wound bee sinuous and deep in such maner that the medicines cannot be conueyed vnto all the offended parts, then you may make iniection with the decoction following.

               Many doe erre also in the too frequent vse of Setons, in this; That not applying themselues to reason, they do vse to renew them alwaies, wherby they rub and fret away the tender flesh on the edges of the woun

To which end, it is fitting that the boulster be perforated iust vpon the orifice of the sinuous vlcer, and vpon the hollow tents; & that

therein there bee placed a sponge to receiue the Sanies: for by this meanes the expulsion, euacuation, and absumption thereof, shall be much better. In rolling, the Ligature ought to bee first begun on the bottom of the sinus, with a mean combustion, to the end that the matter bee not retayned within the Cauity thereof. The Rollers and Boulsters proper to this operation, shall bee first moistned in Oxycrat, or soure Wine, or in any other astringent liquor, to roborate and strengthē the part, and to hinder the defluxion. But great heed ought to be taken, that ther be not too great an astriction made vppon the part, because that thorough the astriction or straight binding, extreame paine may be produced by meanes of the exhalation of the fuliginous excrements which therby are prohibited. Also it may cause the member to become Atrophied or withered thorough the too long continuation of the said Rollers.

For euery rationall and Methodicke Chirurgian knoweth well, that other remedies are required in a Chollericke body, then in a Flegmatick; and so of the other temperatures both simple and compound. Vnder the which Indication of the temperature, shall bee comprehended that of the Age, which receyueth not all remedies alike, but demaundeth some for the yong persons, and others for the old.
               Moreouer, Indication is to bee taken from the custome or manner of liuing of the Patient; as whether hee hath beene accustomed to eate and drink much, and at all houres: for then you ought not to ordaine him such an exquisite dyet as vnto him that is accustomed to eate and drinke but little, and at certaine houres: and therefore the diet of Panades are not so proper vnto vs as vnto the Italians, because our bodies require more lenitiue things: which effect it woorketh with them, because of Custome, which is a second Nature. Vnder this accustomed manner of liuing, ought to be vnderstood the condition of the life, and the

exercise of the Patient, forasmuch as you ought to vse stronger remedies vnto the robusticke & men of labour, such as haue their flesh hard, then you ought to vse vpon the delicate, and such which labour but little, and exercise lesse. Some there bee that had rather comprehend this Indication vnder that of the temperature. For my part I wil not dispute of it, but will leaue the resolution thereof wholly to the Doctors.

                      taken from the vertue of the patient.The Indication taken from the vertue of the patient, is aboue all other things to be respected, because that it failing or being very weake, all other things ought necessarily to bee best to come vnto it. As when we are inforced through necessity to take off a member, or to make any great incisions, or such like things, if the patient haue not vertue sufficient to indure the paine; it is necessary to deferre such operations (if it possible) vntill that Nature be restored, and hath recouered her vertues both by good nourishment and rest.
               Another Indication may bee taken from the Ayre which doth encompasse vs: vnder the which are comprehended the seasons of the yeere, the region, the place of our abiding, and the constitution of the time. For accordi

                     •
                  ties, the Medicines ought to be prepared. And therefore (as sayth Guido) the wounds in the head are more difficult to heale at Paris then at Auignon;Sentence of Guido. and the wounds in the legges are more tedious at Auignon
                  
then in Paris; by reason that in Paris the ayre is more cold and moyst then at Auignon, which is a contrary thing, especially to all woundes in the head. Contrarywise, in Auignon, the heate of the incompassing aire doeth melt and subtillize the humors; whereby such humours more easily and in greater abundance do fall downe into the legs: from whence it commeth that the wounds in the legges are more difficult to cure at Auignon then at Paris. But if any one doe alledge experience to the contrary, that the woundes in the head, do more often become lethall or mortal in hotte Regions then in colde. To him I answer, that that proceedeth not by reason of the aire, inasmuch as it is hot and dry, but because of some superfluous humidity or euill vapour communicated with the aire; as in those partes of Prouence and Italy, which are neere to the Mediterranean sea.
               The Indication of curation may also bee taken from the temperature of the wounded partes:Indication taken from the wounded part. for the fleshy parts doe require other remedies then the Bones or the Neruous partes, and so others. The like ought to bee obserued concerning the sensibility of the saide parts, which in like manner altereth the manner of curation: for it is not sitting to apply such sharpe and violent medicines to the Nerues and Tendons, as to the Ligaments and other insensible parts. The dignity and action of the wounded parts hath no lesse priuiledge in the act of curation then the former. For, if the wound be in the Braine, or in any other of the vitall

or naturall parts, it behooueth that their Medicines diuersified and applied according to their dignity and action, because that from the contemplation of these wounds, is oftentimes gathered a certain iudgement of the insuing accidents. For such woundes which doe penetrate into the ventricle of the Braine, the Heart, or in the great vessels,Aph

Also such which are in the ioynts, or neere thereunto, and in bodies Cacochymed or of an ill habitude are oftentimes mortall, as hath beene sayde heere before. In like manner, the Indications which are taken from the position and colligance of the affected part ought not to bee forgotten, neither the figure thereof, as Galan hath sufficiently explained in the 7. of his Method, and in the second to Glaucus.
               
            
            
               CHAP. IX. How Diseases become compounded.
               MOreouer in taking the aforesaid Indication, you ought to consider whether there bee a complication of the disease, or not: For, euen as the simple disease proposeth a simple Indication, so the complications of the indispositions against Nature, do propose mix
                     •
                  d or compounded Indications. Now the aforesaide complications are made after three manner of wayes that is to say,

disease with disease; as a Wound with an Apostume or fracture of the bones. Disease with cause, as an Vlcer with defluxion. Disease with symptome, as a wound with paine, or with a Fluxe of blood. Or all things against Nature together, as disease, cause, and symptome.
               Now that you might know how to handle artificially all these complications, you must followe the Doctrine of Galen, in the 7. of his Method, who exhorteth vs to consider the complicated affections, as that which is the most vrgent,The Vrgent the cause, & the necessity the cause; and that w

The symptomes inasmuch as they are symptomes, do not giue any Indication at all, neyther do they charge or alter the order of the curation. For in taking away the disease, which is the cause of the symptome, they are remooued, because they depend thereon, as the shadow doth the body: although oftentimes we are constrained to leaue the disease in an irregular care, to come vnto the accidents of the Disease; the which if they are vrgent, doe holde the

place of the cause, and not properly of the symptomes.

                   sometimes it is not possible to put the aforesayde Indications in execution, either because of the greatnesse of the wound, or the excesse and disobedience of the Patient; or because of some other indisposition which hath happened through the ignorance of the Chirurgian, or from the ill or disordered application of the Medicines. And therefore by meanes of these things, there followeth great paines, Feauers, Apostumes, Gangrenaes (vulgarly and abusiuely called Estiomenes) Mortifications, and oftentimes death it selfe. Moreouer those that receyue wounds by Gunshot, do eyther dye, or else remaine maymed and defectiue all their life after.
            
            
               
               CHAP. X. How the Chirurgian shall proceede in the handling of the saide wounds.
               IN the beginning therefore, great regard ought to bee taken to mittigate the payne as much as may be, by repercussing the defluxion, by ordayning a dyet according to the six vnnatural things, and they annexed, by anoyding all hot and sharp things, and by diminishing or altogether prohibiting wine, lest it should heat, subtillize, & make the humors flow to the part. His maner of liuing, ought in the beginning to be very slender, thereby to make revulsion. For when the stomacke is not filled sufficiently, it attracteth from all partes vnto it: by meanes whereof, the externe parts hauing affinity therewith, do remaine empty. And this is the reason wherefore the patient ought to keepe a slender dyet in the first dayes of his hurt. Venus is altogether contrary vnto them, inasmuch as it enflameth the humors and spirits more then any other motion: and for this cause it maketh the wound to bee much enflamed and subiect to defluxion. And it wil not be amisse in the beginning if there be a sluxe of bloode, to let it moderately flow, thereby to discharge the body and the part: and where it hath not sufficiently flowed, you ought the day following to vse revulsiue Phlebotomy,Phl

Now this continuation of them so long in the body, without any corruption or euill accident (in my opinion) doth proceede from no other thing but from the matter of the Lead, whereof the sayd Bullets were composed. For so it is, that Lead hath a certain familiarity and agreement with nature, especially of the fleshy parts: euen as we see by ordinary experience, which teacheth vs, that Lead being outwardly applyed, hath the vertue to close and cicatrise old vlcers: but if the bullet were of stone, of Iron, or of any other mettal, it is a most assured thing, that they cou

               CHAP. XIIII. Memorable Histories.
               OFtentimes the aforesaide wounds are accompanied with many indispositions, as oedemateus tumors, fracture of the bones, and the like,Historie. as (for the yong Chirurgians sake) I will relate this historie for an example, of the hurt of the Earle of Mansfelt, Gouernour of the Dutchy of Luxembourg, Knight of the order of the King of Spaine, who was hurt at the battell of Moncontour, with a Pistoll shot vpon the ioynt of his right arme or elbow, which fractured the bones; whereof there were many that were fractured in such small peeces as if they had bene broken with a Mallet, because he receiued the blow so neere at hand, and through the violence and force of the blow, there hapned vnto him many accidents; as extreme dolors, inflammation, feauer, an oedemateous Tumor; a flateous or windy tumor all the arm ouer, yea euen to the ends of the fingers, together with a preparation vnto a Gangrena. Which to preuent, and also the totall mortification therof, M. Nicholas Lambert, and M. Richard Hubert, Chirurgeons in ordinary to the King, had made many and deepe scarifications. Now by the Commandement of the King, I was sent for to come vnto the aforesaide patient to dresse him: where being arriued, seeing the aforesaide accidents to be accompanied with a most faetide putrifaction, we were resolued to apply on the saide scarifyed

parts, of Aegyptiacum fortified and dissolued in vineger and Aqua-vitae and such remedieswhich are proper for the cure of Gangrenaes. Ouer and besides these accidents, the saide Lord had a flux of the belly, by the which he expelled of the fanie quitture which came from the Vlcers of his arme. This many will not beleeue, forasmuch (as they say) that if it should descend by the belly, it followeth of necessitie that the saide matter should be mixed with the blood. Also that in passing neere vnto the heart, and through the Liuer, it woulde cause many accidents, yea death it selfe. Neuerthelesse I doubt not but that I haue sufficiently answered all these Obiections, how and in what manner it is done in my booke Of the suppression of the vrine; wherefore, if any desire to know the reason thereof, he may haue recourse to the saide Booke.
               In like manner, the said Lord fel of

                  entimes into a Syncope, by reason of the putrified vapours which ascended vp from the vlcers, which vapors by the Nerues, Veines, and Arteries, were communicated to the stomack,Aqua-vitae with a little Trea

                      presenthe the spirites, and comforteth the vital faculty. and other noble parts. For which cause I gaue him sometimes a spoonefull of Aqua vitae to drinke, wherein I dissolued a little Treacle. Mounsieur Bellanger, Physitian in ordinary to the King, and Mounsieur le Bon Physitian to my Lord the Cardinall of Guize, men of vnderstanding, and expert in Physicke and Chirurgerie, imployed all their skill (as much as was possible) to resist his Feauer, and other accidents

which hapned to him. As for the Oedemateous and flatulent tumor which wholy occupied al the arme, I applied thereon staples wet in Oxycrat, with salt, and a little Aqua-vitae, and other remedies, which shortly shall bee shewed. Then with double clothes I 
                     •
                  ewed them vp as strong & hansomly as I could possible, that is to say, as much as the said Lord could indure it. This compression serueth both to containe the fractured Bones in their places, and also to expell the sanies from the vlcers, and to repel the humors towardes the center of the bodie. And when the binding and rolling of his arme was omitted, the tumour did increase in such manner, that I verie much feared the natural heate of his arme would be suffocated and extinguished. Now for to make anie other manner of Ligature it was altogether impossible, because of the extreame paine that hee felt, if his arme had bene remoued neuer so little. There hapned vnto him also many Apostumes about the ioynt of his elbow, and in other partes of his arme: wherefore to giue issue to the Sanies, I made him manie incisions; all which the saide Lorde indured willingly, telling me that if two would not serue, make three, yea foure; such was the desire that he had to be out of his paine, and to be cured. Then (smiling to my selfe) I told him that he deserued to be hurt, and not these tender and delicate persons, who wil rather suffer themselues to rot, yea to indure the paines of death, then to indure anie necessary incision to be made

for the restoring of their healths.
               Now, to shorten his cure, he vsed of a Vulnarie potion, and somtimes there was incerted with a Syringe into his vlcers of Aegyptiacum dissolued in wine, or else in the saide Potion, or rather Mel Rosarum insteed of the Egyptiacum to mundifie them, and to correct their putrifaction; and other remedies which would be too tedious here to recite: and among others, of the powder of Alome combusted, to dry vp and consume the high and spongeous flesh. Also for the mundification of the said vlcers, I vsed a long time nothing but dry Lint, which was as much in quantity euerie dressing, as a Mans fist. And on a day, seeing that he was without paine, and that the flesh began to regenerate, I told him that now he began to bee wel: then he saide to me laughing, I know it very wel, for now I see you doe not vse the fourth part of the Lint you did before. In the time of his curation, I protest that I tooke from him more then threescore peeces of bones. Of the which, some were as great as my finger broken in a verie strange figure, yet notwithstanding the said Lord (thankes be to God) was perfectly cured: onely it remaineth that he cannot, nor neuer will, bow or stretch forth his arme.
               
                  Historie.Mounsier de Bassompierre, Collonel of two hundred horse, the day of the aforesaide battaile, was hurt with such another shot, and had a great part of the aforesaid accidents: whom also I drest vntill his perfect curation, which (thankes bee to

God) he attained. True it is, that hee continueth impotent as the other Lord is.
               After that I had cured the aforesaid Lords, the Earle of Mansfelt, and Bassompierre,Another history. I was commanded by the King to imploy all my diligence in the curation of Charles Phillippes de Croy, Lord of Hauret, Brother to my Lord the Duke of Ascot, nere to Mons in Haynault, who had alreadie kept his bed seauen months and more, by reason of a wound that he receiued by a Musket-shot, three fingers aboue the knee, whom I found with these accidents following; namely, extreame paynes, a continuall Feauer, cold sweatings, losse of sleep, that part situate vpon Os Cauda,
                  Meruellous accidents. vlcerate in compasse as much as the palme of my hand (because he had lyen so long time on his backe) hee tooke not any rest day nor night, with losse of appetite of meate, but dranke inough. Hee was somtimes surprized in his bed with the fits of the Epilepsie, & had oftentimes a desire to vomit, with a continuall shaking, insomuch that he could not bring his hand to his mouth without the helpe of another; he fel oftentimes into a Syncope or fainting of the heart, because of the putrified vapors that were communicated to the stomacke and the noble parts, by the Veines, Arteries, and Nerues: the which we eleuated from his vlcers, and from the corruption of the bones. For the Thigh-bone was fractured and shiuered both long wise and ouerthwart, with diuers splinters; whereofsome were already separated, others not. Hee also had

an hollow vlcer neere vnto the groine, which ended about the middle of the thigh. Moreouer hee had other sinuous and caniculous Vlcers about the Knee. All the Muscles both of the thigh and legge were extremely tumified and imbued with a flegmaticke, cold, moyst, and flatulent humor, in such sort, that the natural heate was verie neere suffocated and extinguished. Seeing al these accidents, and the strength and vertue of the patient greatly decayed and abated, I was stroke with an exceeding sorrow, because that I was sent vnto him, and seeing little hope of recouery, for I feared greatly that he would die vnder my hands. Neuerthelesse,God & Nature effect meruailous things. considering his youth, I had some small hope, for God and Nature bringeth sometimes such things to passe, which seemeth vnpossible to the Chirurgian.
               I then demanded of the saide Lord, if hee had a good courage: and told him likewise, that if hee would indure the making of certaine incisions, the which for his curation were very necessary, by that meanes his paines and his other accidents would cease. He answered, that he would willingly indure whatsoeuer I thought conuenient, yea, to the amputation of his legge, if I thought it necessary. Then I was verie ioyful, and presently after I made two Orifices to giue issue to the Matter that lay about the bone, and in the substance of the Muscles, wherby there yssued forth a great quantity. Afterwards, iniection was made with wine, and a little Aqua-vitae, wherein there was

dissolued a good quantity of Egyptiacum, to correct the putrifaction, and to dissicate the loose & spongeous flesh, and to resolue and consume the ordemateous and flatulent tumor, and to ease his paines, to refocillate and fortifie the natural heat which was greatly prepared to be altogether suffocated, because the parts could not concoct nor assimilate the nourishment necessary for them, by reason of the great quantity of matter therein contained. His Chirurg
                     •
                  an, named M. Anthony Maucler, an honest man, of great experience in Chirurgery, dwelling at Mons in Haynault, and my selfe, we concluded to make him fomentations, with the decoctions of Sage, Rosemarie, Time, Lauander, Camomile flowers, Melilot, and red Roses boyled in white wine: and so a lexiue made with the ashes of oake, a little portion of vinegar, and an handfull of salt. This decoction so made, hath vertue and power to subtilize, attenuate, incise, resolue and to dissicate the colde, grosse, and 
                     •
                  legmaticke humor, and to roborate the wounded parts. The said fomentations were vsed a long time together, to the end that the resolution may thereby be made the greater. For being applyed long together, it resolued more, by liquifying of the humour which was in the profound partes: whereas otherwise it would haue but rarifyed the skin, or the fleshy parts of the Muscles.
               And for this intention we made him many frications with hot Kerchiefes in all manners,Galen in the 6 of the Method. that is, from the higher parts downewards, and from

the left side to the right: also circular wise, and this a long space together. For the breefe Frications, I meane those that are made in short time, maketh attraction, but resolueth nothing at all. In like manner euery other day, there was applied all about his Thigh and legges, euen to the sole of his foot, of Brickes heated and sprinkled with vineger and white wine, with a little portion of aqua vitae; and through this euaporation, you shoulde perceiue many Aquosities to proceed foorth of the pores of the skin by sweating, whereby the tumor diminished, and the naturall heate was reuoked. Also there was applyed compresses or Boulsters on the tumified parts, dipped and infused in a levine made of the ashes of oake; with the which, was boyled Sage, Rosemary, Lauander, Salte, Aqua vitae and Cloues; and Ligature was made with such dexterity as the patient could well endure it: and to so good purpose, that if it had bin but one day omitted, wee might easily perceiue the tumor. Also there was applyed good big Bolsters on the bottome of the sinus of the vlcers, to depresse and expell away the Sanies. And sometimes for the better accomplishing thereof, the orifices of the vlcers were kept o
                     •
                  en with hollow Tents. Somtimes also to resolue the tumor, there was applyed a Cataplasine thereon made thus:

               In like manner,The Emplaster of Vigo is resolutiue. wee made vse of the Emplaisters of Vigo sine mercurio, which helped greatly to ease his paines, and to resolue the saide Tumor. Neuerthelesse it was not applyed vntil the parts were first heated, by the meanes of fomentations, Frications, and euaporations, or otherwise that Emplaster could neuer haue wrought that effect thorough the cold distemperature of the parts. Now for the Mundification of the vlcers there was applyed remedies proper thereunto, chaunging and alteting them according as wee found occasion. Also the Catagmaticke powders to separate the bones, and to correct their putrifaction were not spared him: hee vsed also for the space of fifteene dayes of vulnary potion.
               I may not here omit to speake of the Frications which hee suffered euery Morning vniuersally ouer the whole body, which was greatly extenuated and weakned both by reason of his dolors, & other accidents (as we haue saide) and also for the want of exercise.The benefit of vniuersal Frications. The said Frications did reuoke and attract the spirits and the blood, and resolued such fuligenous humors which were detained betweene the skin and the flesh. And therefore the parts were afterwardes better nourished and refreshed; so that so soone as his paines beganne to passe away, as also the Feauer, he began to sleepe well, and to haue a good appetite, and therefore we caused him to vse good Meates, and to drinke good wine and good be

                  thes: and by this meanes he became fat and lasly, and perfectly cured. Onely it remaineth that he cannot wel bend his knee.
               Now the reasons that mooued mee to recite these Histories, is onely to instruct the yong Chirurgian to the practise thereof, and not that anie glory of praise might be attributed to me: but to restore them to God, knowing that all goodnesse proceedeth from him as from an euerlasting fountaine, and nothing of our selues. And therfore we ought to giue thankes vnto him for all our good workes; humbly beseeching him to continue and augment them more and more in vs, through his infinite goodnesse.
            
            
               CHAP. XV. An Apologie touching wounds made by Gun-shot.
               THere hapned into my hands not many dayes past,A iust occasio
                        •
                      of the Author for his Apology a certaine Book written by a Physitian; wherin he very openly contradicteth that which I haue written heretofore, as concerning wounds made by Gunshot and their curations. I protest that if there were no other cause, or that there were no other interest heerein then the contemning of me and my Book, I would let these things alone, and passe them away vnder silence; knowing well, that all answers and replies whereby we striue to stop the Mouths of euill speakers, do oftentimes

rather giue them a further occasion of speaking then otherwise; and that there is no better way to stay such Controuersies, then by not answering one word. Euen as we see that the fire is extinguished when the combustible matter ceaseth, by taking away the wood. But when I did consider the euident danger that many wold fall into, if they came to follow those rules and instructions that the saide Physitian setteth downe for the cure of the saide wounds, I therefore thought it my duty to preuent this euill, and to hinder it as much as lieth in mee, in regard of my profession. The which beyond that common affection which all men owe to the publike weale, doeth binde me particularly to this, in such manner, that I could not with a good conscience become deaf and dumbe, when both my particular and generall duties, do binde and constraineime to speake. This therefore was the true cause that did solicite me to make this Apologie, rather then any passionate or boyling desire in me, to haue my reuēge of him who hath truly assaulted me.
               Now in this booke, he pretendeth to despise & contemne the application of suppuratiue Medicines, as Bassilicon, and others of that nature.Basilicon liquefied into an oyle, is proper in al woundsthat

                     equire suppuration. Also of those that are sharpe, as Egyptiacum, and such like. For (saith he) such remedies haue beene the cause of the deathes of an infinite number of men, whereunto they haue beene applyed; yea, although that their wounds were but superficiall, and in fleshy parts. And that heerein the counsell

of Hippocrates ought not to be followed,Hyp. in his

                     s. who saieth, that all contused wounds ought to be broght to suppuration, because (sayth he) this is a new disease, and vnknowne to the Ancients, and therefore it requireth new remedies. Also that thunder and the violent effect thereof, ought not to bee compared to the reports of Artillery.
               Now seeing that he striueth to contradict all that I haue written before in my book of wounds made by Gunne-shot, Arrowes▪ and Dartes, I am constrained for my defence, to repeate somewhat of that which I haue heeretofore divulged, to reproue all these points (as I hope) one after another.
               First of all, that suppuratiue Medicines are not proper in such wounds, it is against reason, authority, and experience: for euery one knoweth that the Bullet being round and massiue, cannot make any entrance into our bodies, without great contusion and bruising; the which cannot bee cured without suppuration, according to the authority not onely of Hippocrates, but also of Galen, and all other Authors both Ancient and Moderne. And what doth it serue him to call such new woundes, to derogate from the saying of Hippocrates whom we hold to be the Father, Author, and Founder of the Lawes of sacred Medicine, which are worthy of all esteeme and praise aboue all others, because they are not subiect to change, as all others that are established by Kings and Princes, neyther are they tied to the prescription of times, nor

the customes of Regions. Therfore if I haue herein followed the Hippocratick Doctrine, which is alwayes found true and st
                     •
                  ble, I perswade my self to haue done well. And therein I haue not bene in that conceit alone; for Mounsieur Botall, Physitian in ordinary to the King, and Mounsieur Ioubert Physitian to the King also, and his Lecturer in ordinary in the vniuersity of Mont-pellier, men well experimented both in Physicke and Chirurgery, haue lately written of this matter. Commending, and commanding the application of Bassi

                     n & other suppuratiues in the beginning of such wounds.
               These men, because they haue followed the warres, haue seene more wounded by shot, then our Physitian hath done all his life time. As for experience, there is an infinite number of other good Chirurgians, and greatly experimented, who haue and do vse of these remedies in the beginning, to bring those wounds to suppuration, if there be no Indication that doth contradict it. I know moreouer that an Empericall Chirurgean, a neighbour of his called Doublet,
                  Doubles an Empirick. hath many and sundry times done meruailous cures, by applying onely in those woundes a suppuratiue Medicine, composed of melted Bacon, the yolke of an Egge, terebinthinae, with a little Saffron, and this he held for a great secret.
               There was also another at Thurin in the yeere 1538. (I being then in the seruice of the late Marshall of Monte-ian, Lieutenant Generall of the

King at Piedmont) who had the report aboue all the Chirurgeans in those partes, for his excellent cur

This an infinite number of Chirurgeans haue vsed, after that I had described it in my Booke of wounds made by Gun-shot with good and happy successe.

                     um. because there hath not bin yet discouered a more singular remedie to correct and preuent the putrifaction which happeneth most commonly in those wounds, the which doe degenerate oftentimes into virulent, corrosiue, ambulatiue, and malignant Vlcers, casting forth a stinking Sanies, whereby the part salleth into a Gangrena, vnlesse it be preuented by Egyptiacum, and other sharpe medicines. And for this cause they haue bene very much approued by the saide Botal and Ioubert, and of all good Chirurgeans; yet neuertheles our Physitian maintaineth that they are venomous, because (saith he) that being applyed in woundes by Gunne shot, they haue beene the cause of the death of many persons; which is a thing so absurd and against reason, that I will leaue the resolution thereof to the Towne-Barbers, who I am sure are

of skill sufficient to confute the grossenes of that imputation; or if their want of iudgement be such that they cannot, yet the consideration of euerie one of the ingredients of the sayde Aegyptiacum would suffice to shew, that it is so free from anie venomous quality, that it doth resist, & is directly contrary to all sorts of poisons and putrifactions which may happen in the fleshy partes, by reason of any wound or vlcer.
               He saith moreouer, that the disposition of the aire cānot be the cause to infect or restore wounds more daungerous at one time then at another. Herein also he is of this opinion alone. But if hee had well read and vnderstood Hippocrates, he had not so lightly contemned the constitution of the seasons, and the infection proceeding from the aire not simple and Elementary (for being simple, it neuer acquireth any putrifaction) but by addition and commixtionwith other corrupted vapors, as I haue written in my treatise of the Pestilence: For inasmuch as the aire that doth incompasse & inclose vs, is perpetually necessary vnto our liues; it followeth therefore, that according to the indisposition thereof, our bodies also altered in manie and sundry manners, because we do draw it continually by meanes of the Lungs and other partes, seruing vnto respiration; and also by the pores & euery little inuisible hole throughout the bodye, and by the Arteries dispersed in the skinne. And this is done both for the generation of the spirite of life, and also to refresh and foment our naturall

heate. For this cause, if it be immoderately hotte, cold, moist, or dry, or otherwise distempered, it altereth and changeth the temperature of our bodies vnto its owne quality. This is cleerely seene: for when it is infected by the putrified and Cadaueruous vapors produced from a great multitude of dead bodies that haue not bene buried soone enough; as of men, of ho
                     •
                  ses, and other beasts. As it happeneth after any battell, or when many men haue perished by shipwracke, and haue bene cast ashore through the violence of the waues. As for example, the memory is yet f
                     •
                  esh, of the corruption of the aire which proceeded from deade bodies at the castle of Pene, situate vpon the riuer of Lot, in which place, in the yeare 1562. in the moneth of September, whiles the first troubles hapned about Religion, there was a great number of dead bodies fell into a pit of an hundred fathome deepe, or thereabouts: from whence, two moneths after, there was eleuated such a stinking and venomous vapor, which dispersed it selfe ouer all the countries of Agenois, and the neighbouring places within the compasse of thirty miles round, that thereby many were infected with the pestilence, whereof we need not wonder; for the wind blowing▪ and driuing the exhalations and corrupted vapors from one countrey to another, doeth infect them with the saide pestilence.
               In like manner, the euill constitution of the aire, whether the cause be manifest or hidden, may make wounds to become putrified, alter the spirits

and the humors, and cause death. This therefore ought not to be attributed vnto the woundes, because that they which are hurt, and those that are not, are both equally infected, and fall into the same inconueniences.

                  er to cure at Paris then at Auignō, and that the Vlcers of the legges were more difficult at Auignon then at Paris, forsomuch as at Paris the aire is cold and moist, which is a contrarie thing, especially to wounds in the head. Likewise in Auignon, the heare of the aire doe liquefie and subtilize the humors: and therefore, more easilie and in greater abundance do the humors fall into the Legges, whereby the curation of the Vlcers in those partes, is more difficult at Auignon then at Paris. But if any one alledging experience shall say the contrary, that the wounds in the head are for the most part mortall in hot countreyes: To him I answere, that that proceedeth not from the aire, as it is more hot and dry, but rather because of some superfluous humidity and euil vapor communicated with the aire, as in the places about

                  Prouence, and of Italy neere vnto the Mediterrenean sea. Now, there is not a Chirurgean of so little vnderstanding, that knoweth not but if the aire be hot and moyst, the wounds doe easily degenerate into a Gangrena and putrifaction. As for experience, I wil giue him a familiar example. Wee see that in hot and moyst weather, and when the Southerly winds blow, that flesh doth putrifie in lesse then two houres, though it were neuer so lately killed, in such fort that Butchers in those times do kill no meate but euen as they sell it. Also there is no doubt to be made but that humane bodies doe fall into affections against Nature, when the qualities of the seasons are peruerted through the euil disposition of the aire: as hath bene seene, that in some yeres, wounded persons haue bin most hard to cure, and oftentimes dyed of very smal wounds, what diligence soeuer the Physitians and Chirurgians could vse. The which I noted well at the siedge which was planted before Roan: for the corruption of the aire did alter and corrupt the blood and humors in such sort, by the meanes of inspiration and transpiration, that the wounds became so putrid and faetide, that they sent forth a Cadauerueous smell: and if it hapned that one day had bene omitted wherein they had not beene drest, you shall finde the next day a great companie of wormes in them, with a meruellous stench; from whence were eleuated many putrified vapours, which by their communication with the hart caused a continual F

of the generation of good bloode, and with the Braine they produce alienation of the spirits, fainting, convulsion, vomitings, and by consequence death: and when their bodies were opened, you should finde Apostumes in many partes of theyr bodies full of a greene stinking Sanies, in such sort that those that were within the Town seeing these things, that their wounded persons coulde not be cured, saide that those without had poisoned their bullets: and they without saide the like of those within: and then perceyuing that those wounds did rather turne to putrifaction then vnto any good suppuration, I was constrayned, and with mee the most part of all the Chirurgea

                  s to leaue suppuratiues, and insted of them to vse the Vnguent Aegyptiacum, and other such like remedies, to preuent the said putrifaction & Gangrena, and other of the aforesaide accidents.
               Moreouer, if the diuers courses of the heauens haue power and force to imprint a pestilence in vs thorough the influence thereof, why is it not possible that the like may be done in a wound, to infect it after many wayes? Experience it self giueth vs a good and sufficient testimony, not onely in hot weather, but also in winter. For we see that euery patient whether he be wounded, or otherwise disposed against Nature, are tormented more of their greefes when the weather is subiect to raine, then when it is faire weather. And the reason is, because the vapour and moyst aire, and southerne winds, do inwardly mooue and agitate

the humors which afterwards do discharge themselues vpon the afflicted parts, & thereby increase their paines.
               Our Physitian hath also written, that in the battels of Dreux and of S. Denis, which were fought in the winter time, there dyed a great number of men, that I confesse too; but I deny that it was by the application of suppuratiue medicines, or of Corrosiues, but thorough the vehemencie of their wounds, and the disorder that the Bullets made in their members, whereunto the nature of the wounded parts helped greatly, and the temperature of the patient, but aboue all the cold. For the cold causeth wounds to bee of most difficult curation; yea, sometimes it causeth a Gangrena and totall mortification, as witnesseth Hippocrates. And if he had beene with me at the siedge of Metz, he should haue seen many soldiers hauing their legges eschiomened by reason of the colde, and an infinit company of others that died of the colde, although they were not wounded at all. If he will not beleeue this, I will but send him to the top of the Mount Senis in the winter time, where many haue lost their liues, and were benummed and frozen in a moment; witnesse the chappell of Transis, which from thence had that Name giuen it.
               He hath in like maner calumnied me, because I compared thunder with Artillery. Truly it may be saide that they haue like effectes: for this Diabolical1 Similitude gun-powder doth such merueilous things

that it is easie to proue a great similitude the one with the other. And first of all, we may compare the fire that we behold to issue forth of the Cannon to the lightning in this, because it is seen before the Thunder is heard, so is it with the other: and this happeneth, because the eare is not so quicke as the eye to receiue their obiects. Wee may also compare the dreadfulnes of the reports of great Ordinance to that of Thunder.2 similitude For when there is made any notable battery with great Ordinance, their reports are heard sometimes twenty leagues off, more or lesse, according as the windes carrieth the eccho of their noise. The first reports are not heard so plaine, as those that follow; and the cause is, for that the multiplication of the reports following and succeeding one another, that which is nerest doth driue or thrust forward that which is next him, and that in like manner thrusteth forwards the other, and that other the other, vntill it commeth to our eares. In like manner the Bullets are carried by the force of the powder, with such an inestimable swiftnesse, that they breake and batter all that they meete with;3 similitude yea, they haue more force against hard and vnresistable things then against soft things: therein also they do resemble Thunder, which shiuereth the sword in the scabberd, and yet the scabberd remaining whole, melting Siluer in a purse, the purse vnburnt. In like manner (as I haue said here before) hath bene seene many whom the Bullet hath neuer touched, yet neuerthelesse thorough

But yet their similitudes is more manifested by the effects of the saide powder;5 similitude the which beeing enclosed in a Mine, and conuerted into winde or aire by meanes of the fire that is put thereunto, it ouer-whelmeth peeces of earth as great as mountaines▪ breaketh and demollisheth strong towers, reuerseth mountaines vpside downe. This I haue already manifested by that history which I haue elsewhere written, which was that at Paris; there was seene not long since a sodaine disaster by reason of the powder in the Arcenall, which taking fire, it caused such a great tempest, that it made the whole Towne to shake, ouer whelming those houses that were neere thereunto,Hor

and reuerse men halfe dead here and there; taking from some their sight, from others their hearing, and leaueth others so torne in their members, as if foure horses had drawne them to peeces: and all this through the agitation of the aire into whose substance the saide powder was conuerted. The like acte happened in the Towne of Malignes, in the yeere 1546. by the fall of a thunderbolt, within a great and strong Tower, wherein there was a great quantity of Gunpouder, the which did ouerthrow and reuerse almost the one halfe of the Towne, and killed a great number of persons, whereof I sawe a while since many remarkable tokens.
               These examples in my opinion are sufficient to content our Physitian, and to shew him that there is a great similitude betweene the effects of Gun-powder and Thunder. Neuerthelesse, I will not for all that confesse that Gunshot is accompanied with poyson and fire as the claps of Thunder: for although they do agree the one with the other, as doth appeare by the former similitudes, it is not in the substance and matter, but in theyr manner of breaking, battering, and dissipating of the obiects which they meete, that is to say, the thunder-claps by the meanes of the fire, and the stone engendred therein, and Gunne-shot by the ayre impetuously agitated, which guiding the bullet, causeth the like tempestuous disaster, that the thunder doth. These things considered, may wee not therefore confesse, that those who haue

written that the Cannon shot and Thunder to haue a great similitude together, haue had reason so to do? Finally, this Physitian hath not taken much paines to prooue that Gun-pouder was not venomous, and that the bullets are without anie burning at all. Neither in like manner to inuent and name the Instruments proper for the extraction of all strange bodies, because he hath found them already digested in my booke, with manie other things which he hath written, as euerie one may know by comparing his book with mine. He hath also inriched his Book with many sentences and reasons which he hath collected from an Italian Author, named Bartholomaeus Magius, Physitian of Bolognia, who hath written sufficiently thereof in a Treatise called De Vulnerum sclopetorum curatione, although he doth not acknowledg him for his guide. But hauing traduced him almost word for word, hath made it neuerthelesse his owne, and of a Translator, would bee called Author.
               Now let vs come to his goodly practise and new method to cure wounds made by Gun-shot.A new kind of suppuratiue. First of all, hee would haue applyed suppuratiue Medicines, the which neuerthelesse he doeth not vnderstand to be hot and moist, nor of an emplasticke substance; but to the contrary, he ordaineth them to be hot and dry, because (saith hee) that this is not of the nature of an Apostume, wherein there is required no other cure but only to suppurate them. But heere where the woundes are

with contusion, many and diuers Indications arise from thence; for so much as the contusion would be concocted and digested, and the wound desiccated. To answer to this, I would send him to learne the nature and quality of suppuratiues in Galen in the 5. of Simples, and to take all in his way, vntill hee come to the tenth of his Method, which will teach him, that in complicated diseases he ought to consider the cause, the order, and the vigent.
               Moreouer, I would willingly aske of him if hee can heale that wound made by gunshot, vnlesse th
                     •
                   Contusion be first suppurate? I think not: and herein I refer my selfe to the iudgment of al good practitioners; and therefore our Basi
                        •
                     icon and Oleum Catellorum, and other such suppuratiue medicines, are proper to suppurate such woundes as are made by Gun-shot. Secondly, he would haue Oxycratum put into the wound to stanch the fluxe of blood: and if by that means it cannot be stopped, to apply thereon a medicine made of the white of an Egge, Bole Armoniacke, Rose-vinegar and Salt. I leaue you to consider whither such like remedies haue power to stay the flux of bloud or no, they being put with in the wound. Truely they will rather make it flow more, because that the vinegar is of a gnawing and subtle qualitie, causing paine, defluxion, inflammation, & other euill accidents, as I haue knowne by experience: and I know no Chirurgean that hath beene exercised in his Art, will follow such a kinde of practise,

least he finde himselfe deceiued in the end. To this purpose I do remember that I had a Moor in cure, who belonged to Mounsieur the Earle of Roissy, who was hurt before Bologne by an English man, who gaue him a wound with a Lance thorow the backe: whereuppon, to stay the Fluxe of blood, I put into the wound a restrictiue, wherein there was Vinegar insted of another, but presently after he came to me againe, telling me that he thought he had had fire in his arme, which caused me to dresse him anew, and to change the medicine of his wound, and to apply the saide restrictiue vppon it. I beleeue that this Physitian knew not so much, otherwise I esteeme him so honest a man that I thinke he would not haue put it in his Booke for a good restrictiue.
               Moreouer, hee commendeth aboue all other things his Balme made of the oile of wax & myrth beaten together with the yolke of an Egge, or rather the naturall Balsome which is brought from Peru, and saith, that they do consume the superfluous humidity of those wounds, whereby they preuent the happening of any perillous accident. Neuerthelesse, he saith, that they do vnite & consolidate those kinde of wounds, as they do which are incised. Truly it seemeth very strange to mee, to see that any would go about to dresse and cure contused wounds, as simple woundes which demand nothing but vnion. Ouer and besides, these Balmes cānot be proper in wounds made by gunshot, because that by reason of their siccitie they

doe hinder suppuration, without the vvhich they cannot be cured. And if they be needfull at all, it is onely after that the contusion is suppurated, & the wound mundified: and then I know not wher we should finde so many extractors of quintessences to extract and prepare so many Balmes as shal be needfull to dresse those souldiers which shalbe hurt in the assault of a Town,A pleasant answer, and to the purpose. or a skirmish in battell? Neither vvhere they shall get mony sufficient to counteruaile the charge thereof.
               Let vs come to the rest. He ordaineth that these Balmes should be instilled into the vvounds without Tents, yet afterwards remembring himselfe, he saith, that it would be very good to put within them a little short one, onely to keepe the Orifice of the wound open. How is it possible that these Balmes and Vnguents should bee conueyed into the bottome of the wound without Tents or Setons, whose vse is principally to carry medicines vnto the bottome of wounds, and to keepe them open to giue issue vnto all strange bodies? All good practisers will neuer agree with him in this point, nor those which know what it is to handle such wounds.
               Now there is yet another thing worthy to bee well noted, and that is this: After that he had reproued the Vnguent of Egyptiacum, hee neuerthelesse forgetting himselfe, commandeth it to be applyed from the beginning vntill the wound bee altogether suppurated, and to be thus vsed. Take (saith he) of Egyptiacum dissolued in a decoction

on made of the tops of VVormwood, and of Hypericon, and of the lesser Centaury and Plantan, and this to be iniected into the wound. H

                  hall mixe Egyptiacum in equall parts: & (saith he) this vnguent doth suppurate those VVoundes which are made by Gun-shot, I leaue the experimented Chirurgicall Readers to iudge whether such remedies be suppuratiue or not. As for me I do esteeme them to bee proper to mundifie and clense, and not to suppurate. He finally writeth, that the wound ought not to be dressed but once in foure dayes, and where there shall bee fracture of the bones once in eight dayes. He saith moreouer in another place, that it is conuenient to instill euery day ten or twelue drops of balme into the wound. Truely this doctrine serueth rather to confound the yong Chirurgean, as not knowing what manner of practise hee should followe:Euill p

               But wee haue spoken enough of this matter for this time, inasmuch as I am well assured, that these small caui

                  lations shall nothing at all diminish the reputation of my Booke, which is by strangers so much esteemed, that they haue translated it into their owne mother tongues, therby to haue communication

therewith. Therefore now we wil bid our Physitian farewell, but first would pray him to review and correct his Booke as soone as he could, to the end that the yong Chirurgean bee no longer retained in those errours which they may apprehend by reading therein: for the shortest follioes are the best.
            
            
               CHAP. XVI. Another Discourse about the question of the venenosity of wounds made by Gunshot.
               NOt many moneths since, I chanced to bee in the company of many learned Physitians and expert Chirurgeans, who by way of discourse began to put the venenosity of woundes made by Gun-shot; they principally striuing by fiue Reasons to proue that venenosity may bee conioined with those woundes, not because of the powder, which they confesse with mee to be free from venome or poison both in the composition and essence thereof, but by reason of the bullet, within the which poyson may be infused, mixed, and incorporated.
               The first reason is,1 Reason. because that Leade is verie rare and spongeous, as the facility of the dissoluing and softnesse thereof do shew, and therfore by consequence very easie to receiue the imbibition or infusion of any venomous liquor. I answer that that consequence seemeth to me to bee but of small assurance: for in all artificiall mixtions,Answer. as

is that whereof we speake, there are two things to be considered; the matter of the bodies which enter into the commixtion; and the forme according to the matter. Such bodies ought eyther to be liquid, or soft, or brittle, and easie to bee diuided into small portions; to the end, that altogither and on euery part, they may meete, ioy
                     •
                  e, and vnite. According to the forme they ought to be alliable and computible th'one with the other. This is euidently knowne by the water, which though it be easie to mix with an infinit number of other things, yet neuerthelesse they cannot bee mixed together, by the reason of the antipathy of their formes. So Golde and Siluer are so amorous of Lead, that when they are to bee dissolued, they are mingled therewith; but Brasse doth flye from Lead as much as gold and siluer do fly from Tin. If therefore Lead and Brasse be melted together, they can by no meanes be mixed together, thogh both are contained vnder Metallicke kinds. How then can there be incorporated with Lead any venomous thing, being different both in forme and kinde?
               Let vs come to the second reason. Iron (they say) which is more hard,2 Reason. solid and compact, may neuerthelesse receiue a certaine venomous quality, as we see by impoysoned Arrowes, whereof our Ancestors haue heeretofore vsed; and therefore Lead (by more reason) may receiue the like venomous quality.Answer. To answere to that, I confesse that the poyson may well bee receiued on the superficies

of the Iron, but not in the inwarde substance thereof, by way of commixtion. Now here the question is of incorporation, and not of a simple infusion or Vnction.
               Let vs heare the third reason.3 Reason Although that Lead (say they) when it is melted, doeth leaue behinde it a kinde of grosse excrement: neuerthelesse, it is not therfore made vnapt to receiue the infusion of any straunge substance. For, euen as steele a mettall amongst all others the most solid, doeth receiue in the woorking thereof, a temper which doeth harden it of a cleane contrarie substance.

This answer shall likewise serue to confute the fourth reason,4 Reason by the which (say they) that the iuice of Napellus and Rhododendron of Apium risus, and such like, who of their whole substance, do hurt & corrupt ours beeing mingled with Lead, there may thereby be made such a venomous commixtion; that those wounds which it maketh, must of nec
                     •
                  ssity become venomous. I say to the contrarie,Answer that the mixture is only of things which may not onely be applyed, but also fixed, incorporated, & vnited the one to the other. Now how can water

or any other liquid iuyce only be made to adhere and cleaue to Lead which is hard & solid, I meane in that fashion that they may be vnited: the variety heereof may bee iudged better by experience, then by reason. Cause Lead to be melted within the iuices heretofore recited, or any other that you will choose (hauing first weighed them seuerally) and you shall finde the iust measure of the iuices, and the true waight of the Lead, as they were before: a most euident signe, that no part of the Lead is incorporated with the iuyces, nor the iuyces to haue lost any of their substance.
               The first reason is this; The Bullet shot out of a Musket against a stone or any bodye of the like hardnesse,5 R
                        •
                     ason. is not thereby so much heated, but that it may neuerthelesse be handled in the bare hand though it be taken presently after it was shot: and therefore it is false to affirme, that the poyson infused in the Bullet, may be consumed by the fire of the flaming powder. I answer, you must note that when I said that although the Bullet may be handled, neuerthelesse, the fire would consume the force of the poyson; my meaning was, not the fire of the flaming powder,Answer. when the Musket is shot off, but that fire which is vsed to incorporate the molten Lead with the sayde poyson, the which immediately working vpon the poyson, being not yet wholly enwrapped and couered in any strāge body▪ and hauing time and leysure to worke that effect, and not at an instant and altogither, it may if not consume, yet at the least greatly abate the

forces of the said poyson. Those that wil not content themselues with these reasons, let them read Matthiolus vppon the Preface of his sixt Booke of Di

                  on. Behold the reasons, behold the authority, which haue retained in my first opinion, that wounds made by Gunne-shot are not conioyned with any venenosity.
               Heere let not the Reader builde too much on the opinion of Ambrose Parie; for I thinke there is not any Chirurgean that will deny but that a bullet may bee poysoned, notwithstanding the former reasons, which I leaue to be considered by the iudicious and experimented Chirurgean.
            
            
               
               CHAP. XVII. The differences betweene such wounds which are made by arrowes, and those made by Gunshot.
               THese wounds which are made by Arrowes, Crosse-bow shot, or such like Instruments, do differ in two things from those which are made by Gunshot and other fierie Engines. For somtimes they are found without Contusion, which neuer hapneth to wounds made by Gunne-shot. Oftentimes also they are empoysoned, and according to these two differences, their curations ought to be diuersified. Now let vs consider the differences of Arrowes and Darts, because that consideration serueth greatly vnto the knowledge and curation of the said wounds.
            
            
               CHAP. XVIII. Of the differences of arrowes and Darts.
               A Rrowes and Dartes doe differ in matter, in forme or figure, in magnitude, in number, in manner, and faculty or vertue. Their differences in matter is, some of them are of Wood, others of Canes or Reeds: some of them haue their extremities or heads garnished with Iron, Tinne, Lead, Brasse, Horne, Glasse, or of bone, and others not. Their differences in forme are, some of them are round, others angular, others sharpe, others

barbed; some of them hauing their pointes turned backwardes, and some haue it diuided into two parts: some are made broad in their heads and cutting like a knife, and in many other forms and fashions inumerable. As for their magnitude, some of their heads are of three fingers in length; others of a smaller size. Their number causeth a difference herein; because that some are simple, hauing but one point onely; others are composed into two or many. Also in them their manner is to be confidered; for some of them haue the Iron or head inserted within the woode of the Arrow, and of others the Arrow is inserted into the head. Some heades are sixed and nayled vnto the shaft, and others not; but haue so little hold, that in drawing them foorth, their heads remayne behinde in the wounds, whereby they become more daungerous. Their faculty maketh them also to differ in this, because that some are (as hath bene saide) empoysoned and others not. Such are the speciall and proper differences of Arrowes and Darts: according to the which, the dispositions which they leaue behinde them, doeth diuersifie their curation. Thou mayst behold by this following figure the aforesaid differences.

                  ht to make a true & sure iudgement thereof, before you meddle there-with, to the end that there be no occasion giuen vnto the ignorant people to speake euill of our Art. Now, to leaue the Arrow in the body, would cause vneuitable death, and the Chirurgean would be esteemed vnpittiful and inhumane, and by drawing it forth the Patient may peraduenture escape. For, as wee haue saide▪ it is better to attempt a doubtful remedy, then to let the Patient dye, without any succour at all.
               
                  
                  
               
            
            
               
               CHAP. XX. Of the extraction of Arrowes.
               
                  AS touching the extraction of Arrowes, you ought to auoyde the incising, dilacerating, and breaking of the Veines, and Arteries, Nerues and Tendons, if it be possible. For it would be an ignominious thing and against Art, to offend Nature more then the Arrow.
               The manner to draw them foorth is two-fold; the one of them is by extraction, and the other by thrusting it through the member. Therefore, euen at the beginning, and at the first dressing, it is fittest to take foorth all strange bodyes (if anie there be) as the heads of the Arrowes, the shafte or wood, and other such like things, as hath already beene saide of wounds made by Gunne shot, and by the same meanes. And for their better extraction, it is conuenient that the Patient bee situate in the same figure and posture, as at that time when he was hurt, because of the Re

                  sons aforesaide (if it be possible) and then to vse instruments proper to that effect. as principally this following, which hath an hollow quill or pipe diuided in the middle, the outwar

                   toothed; into the which is inserted a rod, like vnto the Tirefond
                  
of Gun-shot, as hath beene figured heere before, excepting onely that this is not made with a Scrue in the extreamity or end thereof. Also it is made greater, to dilate the hollow pipe, therby to fill the cauity of the Iron head. This other Instrument also is very proper, which dilateth by compressing the two extremities together, being toothed also on the outward part; as you may see by these following Figures on the other side the leafe.
               
                  
                  
               
               
                  The first Instrument is opened by meanes of a Vice, which is inserted within the hollowe Pipe thereof.
               The second Instrument doeth dilate, by compressing the two ends together.
               The signes whereby you may know where the Iron head is, that if you feele with your hande on that part where it is, you shall perceiue an asperity and inequality. Also the flesh wil appeare contused, liuid, and blacke, and the Patient will feele an heauinesse and continuall paine in the wounded part.
               The other two Instruments are called Tenacles, with a Vice, together with a Crowes bill: and is very commodious to draw forth the heads of Arrowes, and to extract foorth Maile and other smaller bodies.
               This Instrument vnderneath, is another small Hooke to draw forth Maile, or any other strange body, that it cannot meete with: which also may serue thy turne for the same effect, in the woundes of Gun-shor.
               
               
                  But if it come to passe that the head bee barbed, whether it be of an Arrow, Pike, Dart, or Lance, and shall abide in any part of the bodye. As for example, in the Thighe or Legge, together with some portion of the wood broken therein, in that case the Chirurgean shall cut away the woode or shaft as close as hee can, with incising or cutting Tenacles. Afterwardes he may draw foorth the head with Tenacles that are toothed, as you may see by the figure before going.
               
                  Hippocrates in the fifte of his Epidemies saith, That he hath drawne forth the head of an Arrow sixe yeares after it was shot, it being lodged nere vnto the Groine.
               
                  
                  
               
            
            
               
               CHAP. XXI. How you ought to proceede in drawing forth broken Arrowes.
               
                  BVT if it come to passe, that the head is broken, in such sort that it cannot by any meanes bee apprehended by the aforesaide Tenacles, let it be extracted then (if it be possible) with the Cranes bill, or Crowes bill, or other Instruments, that haue beene described heere before: but if the shaft be broken off so neere the heade, that there can bee taken no holde, neyther of the head thereof, nor of the shaft, with the Cranes bill, then let it be drawne foorth with the Tirefond of Gun-shot, for if it will insert it selfe into Lead, by a greater reason it may easily enter into wood. In like manner, if the head bee barbed, as most commonly your English mens Arrowes are, then if it be possible, thrust it thorough the member, with an Instrument proper thereunto. For, by that meanes you shall auoyde greater danger, because that in drawing it foorth, the Barbils may rend both the Nerues, Veines, Arteries, and the other parts, the which you ought to auoide carefully. And therefore it is better to make a counter Orifice on the other part, iust oueragainst the wound, and so to thrust it cleane through. For, it may be supposed, that there is but a little thickenesse to incise; so by this meanes, and with lesse

danger the wounde will haue a double yssue; the one on the former part, and the other on the hinder part; and will therefore heale sooner, because you may apply your medicines both on the one side, and on the other, and it will also mundifie better. To the contrary, if the barbed head happen vpon a bone, or be inserted therein, which oftentimes commeth to passe in the bottome of the Muscles of the Thigh, of the Arme, or Legge, or other parts of great distance, there it is not conuenient to thrust them through, but rather to dilate the wound, auoiding the Nerues and great vessels, as the good and expert Anatomical Chirurgean ought to do, and then gently and orderly to apply therein a Dilatory hollow in the inward part thereof, and so to place it, that it may apprehend the two Barbils of the Iron head: then with the Cranes bill it may be held steddy, and so draw them forth all three together, as this figure following sheweth thee.

                  NOw, if it happen that the Arrow is so inserted and fixed in the Bone, that it cannot be taken soorth by thrusting it thorough the member, but by drawing it foorth by the same way that it entered in, you ought then to mooue and stirre it too & fro discreetly if it sticke fast in the bone, wherein an especially care ought to be taken that you breake not the Arrowe, and so leaue some part thereof sticking in the bone; from whence might ensue many dangerous accidents. This operation may be done by the Instrument named the Crowesbill, or by others heere before figured presently

               CHAP. XXIII. Of venomous or empoysoned wounds.
               NOw there remaineth to vnderstand and consider, that these woundes are sometimes empoysoned (as we haue saide) and that it proceedeth from the primitiue cause of the Arrowes so prepared by the enemy. This may easily be known both by the report of the hurt person, saying, that he feeleth a great and pricking paine as if hee had bene stung with Bees (especially if the poison wer hot, which is most vsed in that case) and also by the flesh of the wounded part, which presently after becommeth pale and liuide, with a certaine appearance of mortification: wherunto also there doth happen many other g
                     •
                  oefes, and greater accidents, which are not accustomed to happen in all other wounds, wherein there is not any venenosity. Wherefore at the beginning (after that you haue extracted foorth all the strange bodies, if any there be) you ought to make diuers deepe scarifications all about the wound, and to set ventoses thereon with a great flame, thereby to make attraction and euacuation of the virulent matter. In like manner, the sayd attraction may be done, by causing the wound to bee sucked by another man, hauing in the meane time a little Oyle in his mouth, wherein you must haue a care that hee haue not any Vlcer therein, for feare left that the poyson so sucked and attracted cleaue not thereunto.

Also attraction may bee made by the application of Vnguents, Cataplasmes, Emplaysters, Vesiccatories, Cauteries, and other things, which shall be declared heereafter in our particular Booke intreating of the bitings and stingings of venomous Beasts.
