            There is also added a reproofe of an oration and sermon, falsely pretended by the sayd Nicols to be made in Rome, and presented to the Pope in his Consistorye.

                  •
               atholicks and their aduersaries, with a diuision of the booke into three partes.
            2 The firste parte contayneth a narration of Iohn Nicolls, with a refutation of certayne vayne and false vauntes, made of him selfe.
            3 The seconde parte contayneth a confutation of many malitious slaunders, vttered by Nicolls againste Catboliques, but especiallie and more in particuler, against the Pope, the Cardinals, priestes, and religious men, the English studentes in Rome, diuers particuler persons, and againste the cittye of Rome it selfe: where also the contraries, to Nicols reportes, are declared.
            4 The third parte contayneth an explication and defence of certayne controuersies, misunderstood and absurdly peruerted by Nicols.
            5 Nicols oration & sermon published in english since the writing of this booke, & pretended by him as made in Rome, & presented to the Pope, are conuinced of forgery by manifest absurdities, impossibilities, and contradictions.
            6 Also, there is added a late information from Rome, of the true copie of Nicols recantation in that place.
            7 Lastly, there is put downe, an example,

                  It appeareth further by consideration of the premises, that Iohn Nicols his vauntes powred out in his booke to his owne commendation, are as voide of probability, as fraught with vanity, especiallie those, which imply great habilitie, as to preache before the Pope and others, with sufficiencie in the learned tongues, &c. whereof I must speake a word or two for the discrying

of his lacke of modestie, wherof I shall be forced to cōplaine often in the sequel of min answer. First therfore to begin with the principal matter which he reporteth for his credit, to wit, his oration and sermon befor the Pope, let vs heare what he saythe.

                  I had before that time (saythe he) made an oration and a sermon in the latyne tongue, presented before the Pope and fower Cardinales, and before all them that were with the Pope in the consistory.

and soe did the Cardinalls, with all the reste. Héere you sée a longe childishe recitall, with manye particulers, much vanitie, little witt, and lesse trueth. He woulde make you beléeue that he had bene bothe oratour and preacher to the Pope, which, if you saw but onelye his visage, you would hardlye geue any credite vnto. I could improue him also by the testimonies of almoste an hundreth Englishe men, that tyme presente in Rome, but his owne particulers shall sufficiently confute him.
               
                  Firste he putteth not downe whether his oration and sermon were one or two thinges, but if they were twoe, then it is to be vnderstoode, that sermons are not made before the Pope in the Cō

Soe that hitherto I sée not how Iohn Nicols could come to preache before the Pope, and fower Cardinals in the Consistorie, both in respecte of the causes alleaged, and also for that I could neuer yet finde soe few Cardinals in the consistory with the Pope, as fower twise or thrée times tould. The rest which he addeth implieth manifest cōtradictions & impossibilities. For the Popes Protonotorie dwelleth not in the Inquisitorie Palace, by S. Peters Churche, nor hath he any thinge to doe with that Palace, and much lesse dothe he kéepe clarckes wrytinge there in chambers: for onelye the Inquisition hath to doe there. If Sermons and Orations made to the Pope, were to be regestred in paper volumnes (as they are not, and muche lesse in thrée at once as Nicols sayeth, his was) yet this nothing appartayneth to the Popes Protonotorie, or to his clarckes. How the Pope also should geue Iohn Nicols such thanks for his stuffe,

                   as he sayeth, he did, I can not conceaue. For in the Concestorie,

the Popes place is so farre distant from them, which come thither to make orations, as he can not speake vnto him, nor doth he vse to thanke any man that speakethe before him, what soe euer he be: much more impossible is it, that the Cardinalls and the rest in the Consistorie, should geue him thankes for it, as al they wil beare me witnesse which know the place, and presence of the same. Greate learned men, and famous Oratours, haue departed thence without particuler thankes, albeit they did their matters with greate commendation, suche is the grauitye and state of that place. Soe that all this longe tale of Iohn Nicolls, hath not onelye noe probabilitie, but in déede noe possibilitye of truth.
               
                  Heere some perhapps wil aske, howe then, hath this tale noe ground or colour at all whereuppon it was founded? to which I answere, yes, but such a ground as his best frendes are least beholding to him for it, and such, as greatlie discouereth his shamelesse disposition.

If he gett credite by this dealing, as he pretendeth to doe: his hap is good, to deale with men so fauourable to his order. For suerlye, if he should haue dealt soe in some other countries, where ministerie is not sufficient to excuse dishonestie, it would rather haue fallen out to his coste, then his credite, and the deludinge of suche men, would haue bene thought worthier of pillorie then printe.
               
                  After this, he maketh a second vaunt of an other sermon which he made in the latine tonge,

                   mencioneth Festiuall daye, Doctors, Popes chappel, and strangers. But I wil open the misterie, that you maye iudge of his vanitie whoe trobleth you with suche toyes. The Prefect of studies in the Englishe romane colledge, is wonte to commande (and not to request) the studentes committed to his charge, to write some thing for the excercise of the latine tongue, & to recite it in the halle, at the time of dinner, and this excercis
                     •
                   the vnlearnedst of all the Colledge audideth not. Amongest whom Ihon Nicols, vppon S. Péeters daye ad uincula, was commaunded to doe the same: and behould he hathe published it in print, with manie falshodes and vanities annexed. For, that he preached, it is false: for it was only an excecise of learning. That he was requested, is false: for he was commaunded. That it was festyuall daye in Rome, is false: for they kepe it not holye daye there.
               
                  That he preached there against faithe and the newe testament, as he aftarward affirmethe, is most false, as they which were present canne and doe, testifie. Nowe, that this sermon, was before Englishe docters of the cittye, is vanitie: for there could not be aboue some one, for the rest were departed the cittie: and for Englishmen to dyne there, was an ordinarie matter: that some of the Popes chappel were there, is a notable vanitie: for that they were onlye two séely singing men, hired seruantes of the Colledge to teache the studentes to sing, at such time as they wayted not at the Popes chappel. That there were other straungers present, is noe lesse vanitie: for that they were but ordinarie seruantes of the house, one, the manciple, and thother the master of the chappel in the colledge, which bothe are citizens of Rome, and yet not strangers.
               
                  Thus you sée what importante stuffe this felowe bringeth to praise him selfe withal. But whatsoeuer he braggeth or lyeth of him selfe, yet maye you gesse what a sufficient preacher he is, by that, that his felow studentes, vsed commōly to recreate them selues, with his sermons,

which he would at their appointment, vtter, extempore,
                  
                     Iohn Nicols stoole doctryne.
                   from the top of a stoole, and namely those sermons which he had preached before in Englande in time of his ministrie, repeatinge them with all actions and gestures which he had vsed before. He would tell also by name, how he had flattered this or that man present at his sermon. Which properties made him so cōtemptible and rediculous in al mens iudgmentes, as they would not haue imploied him, among all other, to preache in earnest, before anye graue auditorie, albeit his learning had bene sufficient to performe it.
               
                  But nowe because we talke of learninge, some man parhaps may saye, that Ihon Nicols séemeth to haue his part in that, espciallye in the tongues, for that in his epistle dedicatorye to sir Owen Hoptone, he alleagethe one sentence in gréeke, and another in hebrew, out of the byble, whiche argueth that he hathe skill in bothe. To whiche I aunswere, that this is also a vaunte of vanitie, and a méere fantastical florishe of folye, which Iohn Nicols and his fauorours thought good to vse for the casting of a miste before

some mens eyes, and for more probabilitie of that, which with full mouth was geuen out, of his excéedinge great knowledg and facilitie in these tongues. But I know and can auouch the cōtrary, for I am priuie to his defect, not only of wit and discretion, but also of knowledge in these tonges, whereof he vaunteth, and if I were not, yet could I easely make coniecture, both of the one and the other, by these two sentences, which he putteth downe for shewe of great
                     •
                   knowledge.
               
                  For towchinge the first, which is discretion, marke the circumstances of the matter.
                     Iohn Nicolls discretion.
                   He had made in that epistle, a long impertinent request, that Papistes would leaue their errours and imbrace the truth: for performance whereof, he biddeth them neuer to forget two sentences: the one out of Dauid.
                     Psal. 34.
                   
                  He that loueth life and desireth to see good daies, let him keepe his tongue from euill, and his lippes from speaking deceipt. The other of S. Paul:
                     1. Cor. 6.
                   
                  You are bought with a great price, glorifie therefore God in your body and in your spirite which are of God. What pertayne these two sentences

to the matter which he handleth? or why should thes be kept more in memorye by the Papists, thē other sentēses of the scripture? and much more, whye must these sentenses be alleaged in strāg tongues, the one in Gréeke and the other in Hebrewe? especiallye to that man, whose greate busines may hardlye permitt him to vnderstande ether of them, and perhappes was ouermuch troubled with the latine before? but this is Iohn Nicols discretion, to haue no con

                  Now for the seconde (which is his skill) it discrieth it selfe in this one litle sentence which he hath put doune in Hebrew,

                   which (besides the false ortographie in diuers words) he hath so mangled and peruerted in wryting it out, as ther is no sence at all lefte in the same. For where as the wordes in the Hebrewe texte doe stande thus.
                     Psal. 34. ver. 13.14.
                   
                  What man will (haue) life and loueth dayes, to see good? keepe thy tongue from euill and thy lippes from speakinge decepte. He hath soe corrupted it, as it standethe thus

                  Dayes louinge lyues willinge man what good to see and thy lippes from euil thy

tongue keepe decepte from speaking. Is it likelie (thinke you) that this Doctour hath any great skill in the tongue, which coulde not write out two lines without so many grosse and absurd errors? But these are the florishes, wherewith the eares of the simple people are fedd instéed of better learning.
               
                  Hetherto as you see, Iohn Nicols laboreth to gett him selfe some creditt of learning for his preferment. Now shall you sée, what shift he maketh to procure and gaine some opiniō of honesty, which he feareth to be the more difficult point, and therfore pleadeth more earnestly for the same, especiallie that men shoulde thinck, this his last cōuersiō to be trew, sincere, hartie and zelous, and not spotted at all with hypocrisie, or dissimulation.

What cause I haue to vtter these wordes, shall appeare in the sequel of this part, which for more perspicuites sake, I will reduce vnto certaine genaral poyntes, acording to the diuersitie of parties which are slandered in the same.

                     A tast of Iohn Nicols truthe in reporting.
                   He saithe therfore amongest other thinges in his preface, that Catholiques hould the soule of Aristotle to be in purgatorie, thence to be deliuered by dirges and masses. And this is the first and formest of his reportes against vs, the whiche howe malitious, grosse and impudent a slaunder it is, all the world can witnesse, which séethe our bookes wherin we hould more then the plaine contrarie. For we are soe farre of, from saying that infidels or heritiques goe to purgatorie, as also we teach that manie. Catholiques departe hence straight to hell for their wicked lyues, and onlye such goe to purgatorie, as dye in the fauoure of God,

                  in monie, yet will I not, nether can I, but speake the truthe of him & cet. In which wordes he semeth to me, to saye thus muche. Paraduenture you will saye, & the worlde will beare witnes, that the Pope which now is, is a most iust, wise, liberall, and vertuous man, and I my

selfe haue proued the same, besides the

                  But héere before I passe any furder, I must deliuer vnto the Christian Reader,
                     An aduertismēt of S. Ansten about the Pope.
                   from as learned a man as euer liued in Christ his Church, an aduertisement most necessary for thes our times, wherin, euery tonge is exercised in deprauing of him, whoe, if he were the worst liu
                     ••
                   in the world, (as God be thanked is altogether contrarie) yet were he to be reuerenced for his place and dignitie, I meane the Pope or Bishoppe of Rome. The aduertisment is from S. Augustine that famous and learned piller of Christ his holy Church, whoe, being troubled with heretiques and renegates in his time, as we are now, which inueighed against Rome and her Bishops as ours doe, (for alwayes the malefactour detesteth

the lawful iudge) warneth Christians, not to thinke the worse of the authoritie and docttrine of the Bishoppe of Rome, or of his sée Apostolicke, if at any time his lyfe should be wicked, or if heretiques (which alwayes séeke to slaunder him) should bring matter of truth, towching euil lyfe, against him. Wherefore, hauinge reckoned vpp for proofe of his faith, the succession of Bishops of Rome, from S. Peter vnto Anastasius which was Pope in his time, and confirmed the infallibilitie of that succession by the promise of Christ to S. Peter. Vpon this rocke wil I buyld my Church &c.

                   He addeth: To this order of Bishoppes (of Rome) which is deriued from Peter to Anastasius,

                  yet should it haue bene noe preiudice to the Church, and to innocent Christians, to whome, our Lord forseeing, sayed of euil prelates: Doe as they say, but doe not as they doe, for they say and doe not.

not in man. By which wordes we sée, that the euill lyfe of anye Bishoppe of Rome, ought not to deminishe our reuerence or obedience towardes him, noe more then if he were a Sainte.
               
                  But in an other place, S. Austen dealinge agaynst a raylinge heretique, as I doe nowe, handleth this matter more properly to our case. If all (our Bishops) (sayeth he to Petilian the Donatiste) through out the world were such as thou most vaynely doest cauill: yet what hath the chayre of the Church of Rome done agaynst thee, in which Peter sate,
                  
                     The Bishoppe of Rome sitteth in Peters chayre, which heretickes call the chayre of pestilence.
                   
                  and in which at this day Anastatius doth sitt? why doest thow call the chayre or see apostolicke, the chayre of pestilence? If thow doe it for the men, whom thow thinkest to speake the Law, but not to doe it: did our Lord Iesus Christ, wrong or iniure the chayre wherein the Pharases sate, for the Pharases? of whom (notwithstand
                        •
                     ng) he sayed: They say and doe not.
                  
                     Math. 23.
                   
                  Did not he commend that chayre by Moyses, and yet (reseruing the honour to the chayre) reproued the Pharasees? For he sayeth. They sitt on Moyses chayre:

Doe as they say, but not as they doe, for they say and doe not. If you (heretickes) would thinke on these things,
                  
                     Apply this to our time.
                   
                  you would neuer blaspheme the chayre apostolicke, in whose communion you are not, for the men, whome you infame. But what is this other, then not to know what to say, and yet you can not but speake euill? This farre S. Austen against Iohn Nicols and his felowes, whoe fill vp bookes with reproches and slaunders of the Bishoppe of Rome.
               
                  But now let vs sée, what this accuser bringeth in particuler, against his benefactour the Bishop of Rome: (for I will passe ouer al general reproches, wherein ech hereticke aboundeth according to the measure of his owne inuention.) Firste he chargeth this Pope,
                     The first crime obiected by Iohn Nicolls againste

                  with takinge away certaine marchandize from Turkes, in his hauen of Ancona, whereupon ensewed the lyke intreatie towards Christians, from Turks in Constantinople. But this is a false charge, fayned of him selfe, or receaued from some his lyke, in some tauerne vppon the way, as he passed by. For the Pope hath no league at all or truce with the Turkes, whereby ether

Turkes repayre to his dominions, or his subiectes to the Turkes. Wherefore if he stayed any Turkishe vesle at al, (as I can not learne that he did) it must néedes be some pyrate, and not any marchant. Whereby it appeareth, that which he addeth, to be of his owne inuention, that the Turkish Empe
                        •
                     our should writ a letter to the Pope, desiringe restitution of his goodes, and yet could not get it, whereby he was enforced to stay Christians goodes in Constantinople &c. This I say is inuented, to bring the Pope in hatred.
               
                  For first, the Emperour of Turkes vseth not to write letters to Princes, of so smale matters, as the stayinge of one priuate shippe is, and much lesse to the Pope, with whom he hath no league, as is sayed. Secondly, if he had writen any such letters, it had bene harde for Iohn Nicols to know it, beinge of so bas
                     •
                   an estate in those countries, as he was, excepte onely by some tauerne or barbers shoppe, where princes matters are more talked of, then vnderstood. Thirdly, if the Turkishe Emperour had wroten (as Iohn Nicols saieth) yet is it not credible

that the Pope would haue sturred him agaynst Christians, by denyinge so iuste a demaund, which in conscience he could not doe, séeinge he hath not onely doonne more, of him selfe, then that commeth too, but also procured other Princes to doe the lyke, and that without anye letters of soe greate a Potentate as the Turke is, namely, at my being in Rome, I saw a great man of Swetia deliuered from the Inquisition,
                     The Popes iustice and clemencie.
                   with restitution of his monie which was taken at Millaine, and also an Englishe shippe or two, deliuered from Naples, which had béene seased on, there, by the Inquisition, for their misdemenaur before: which all was donne by the Popes request, albeit they were taken in other Princes dominions. Some also, which now lyue in Englande, fallinge into the Inquisition in those countries, can geue testimonie of the Popes iustice, in restoringe them their owne, vppon their dimission.
               
                  Finallye, the Pope hauinge noe subiectes of his owne dominions in Constantinople (as I noted before,) coulde not hurte Christians there, by staying a Turkishe shippe in Ancona, for that other

Princes, hauinge league with the Turke, as the French men, Uenetians, Florentines, and other, they must haue enioyed their liberties, how soeuer the Pope and Turke had disagréeed.
               
                  Bnt now, how farre of the Pope is from voluntarye hurtinge of Christians in Constantinople, and how carefull to doe them anye good he can, especially those which are in seruitude there, it may partlye appeare, by this which I sawe him doe my selfe, at my béeinge in that Citie. There passed through Rome towardes Uenice, and soe to Constantinople, fortie Turkes, delyuered from the Gallies in Naples, vppon exchaung of soe many Christians to be delyuered from lyke bondage in Constantinople. These men béeinge verye poore, made supplycation to this Pope for some reléefe,

                   whoe gaue them fiue hundred frenche crownes, willinge them to procure soe muche courtesie as they might, to Christians abydinge in their Emperoures dominions. By which it maye appeare, howe vniustelye he is slaundered by his malytious and vngratefull scoller.
               
                  
                  
                     The seconde crim obiected.
                  
                  The seconde crime wherwith Ihon Nicols chargeth this Pope, is, That he should put a certaine Countie out of his liuing, in Macerata, not paying him halfe the valew: for the preferring of his sonne Iames to the same. But this is more apparently false then the other was before, for that the world can witnes that there is noe suche facte done, & that the Popes sonne Iames, hathe noe suche countie. Reasone also teacheth vs, that it cannot be true, for that Macerata being vnder another Prince his dominion, to wit, vnder the duke of Urbine, the Pope hath nothing to doe, touching Counties possessions ther, to displace them from the same. And in places and times when iust occations hath bene geuen of gaining of greter matters thē Ihon Nicols talketh of, as of the dukedoms of Ferrara & Urbine them selues, which for wante of ishew, were like to turn again vnto the Church, from whence first they were geuen: this Pope hath well shewed how farr of he is from all extortions, séeing he hath confirmed again to ye former families, in respect of their vertues, the sayde states and dukedomes, which lawfullye he mighte

haue taken.
               
                  And as for his sonne Iames, whome Ihon Nicols saith, He hath raysed from a begger to a marques, able to spend thirtie thowsand crownes by the yeare. True it is,
                     The Popes sonne.
                   that this young gentleman is well able to liue partly by his owne friends, before the presente dignitye of his father, being of a worshipfull and welthie familie, and espetiallye by the Kinge of Spaine, whome he serueth, and from whome he hath receaued diuers good prefermentes. It was reported also, that the howse of Sforza, in which he is matched by mariage, had some talke with the King, about exchanging or buying a certaine state for his children in the Kingdome of Naples. But yet nothing is done, soe that bothe are false, that he was a begger before, or that he is a Marques now. Nether could Ihon Nicols vnderstand of these matters, but only by the seruants of the Romaine Colledg, whose lippes are larger commonly in suche reportes, then their knowledge certaine: as also we maye sée, in Ihon Nicols him selfe whoe pretendeth noe small priuitie to this mans coffers and abilitie, which

notwithstanding he could not learne but by them onlye which knew it least. For albeit this man be the Popes only sonn, begotten in matrimonie before his fathers Priesthode: yet his fathers moderation is such towardes him, (as also towardes the rest of his kinne and carnall frendes): as his verie enemies can not reprehend it, and good men are maruailousllye edified by it.
               
                  
                     The third crime obiected.
                  
                  The thirde accusation, wherwith Iohn Nicols presseth his benifactor the Pope, is, For taking from a moncke two pretious stones, worth a hundreth thowsande crownes, whiche he had broughte from India, and presented to this Pope, which he acepting of, in stead of rewarde, put the monke in prison for departinge his Abby without licence. And this is accounted a great point of iniquitie, which is maruelous, the partie wronged being a monke, from whome to take not onlye moueable goodes, but also his Abbye and lyfe too, had bene noe offence in a protestant Prince, by the cannons of new diuinitie. Marye in the Pope all thinges must be haynous. But yet before indifferent iudges, I might aske this question.

If the matter had bene true, and if the Pope had taken these iewels from the monke, as from his subiect not capable or fitt for soe great riches, and had also punished him for leauing his cloister without order: what lawe or reason maketh this matter so haynous as is obiected? but I am perswaded, that all this whole tale is ether false or mistaken. For diuers which were in Rome since and before Iohn Nicols, doe reporte no suche thing to haue happened in their time, but onlye that a Spanishe marchant, which dwelleth at the foote of Trinitie hill, towardes Porta del populo,
                  
                     Iohn Nico
                           •
                         changinge a marchant to a moncke.
                   brought a Iewel not longe since from India, of some good valew, and being accused by the letters of certaine Bishopes of India, that he had gotten the saide Iewell wrongefullye, was put in prisone by the Pope, vntill he had layde the same in safetie to abide the trial of lawe: which thing happening at Iohn Nicols being in Rome, mighte geue him occasion to erre in his reporte, and to turne that to a moncke, which hapned in a marchante. Especiallye his capacitie being not of the cléerest

cléerest to distinguishe matters, and his intelligence of affayres, comming vnto him from such obscure parsons, as easily might huddle vpp chalke for chéese. And in very déede it séemeth not a matter probable, that a pore monke should light vppon Iewels of so great value, and be suffered to wander the countrie with them, as Iohn Nicols reportethe.
               
                  This then is all wherwith Iohn Nicols chargeth the Pope, which notwithstanding, may wel be called nothing,
                     Iohn Nicols accusations proued to be nothing.
                   in the consideration of indifferent iudges. First, for that they are but triflinge matters in respecte of the manifould great affayres of Princes, whose troublesome & infinite dealinges, are subiecte to suspion of greater iniquities, if they should be called to iudgment, before the tribunall of our imaginations. Secondly, for that, if they were bothe great and haynous, and also true: yet were they noe preiudice to religion, whose slaunder héere is sought, for the reasōs aleaged by S. Ausstē before. Lastly, for that they are false, & supposed only by Iohn Nicols, as may apeare by that alreadie hath bene answered, and also by some thinges which herafter

shall ensue. For thanked be the holy prouidence of our mercyfull Sauiour, he hath blessedly prouided for the malice of our time, by placing in that rowme, soe vertuous and iust a man, as maye stopp the barking chappes of all his spitfull and slaunderous enemies, especially in this crime of couetous iniquitie, obiected against him by the shamles ingratitude of him only, who confesseth the receipt of more lberalitie from him in few monethes,
                     Greate ingratitude.
                   then he could haue gotten at home in many yeares. I saye Pope Gregorie is greatly wronged, to be charged with that vice, wherof neuer Prince in mans remēbrance, hath had so many testimonies of the contrarie vertue. The monumentes of his bountefulnes, pietie and excéeding liberalitie, are extante to the vew of euery manes eyes, whome malice hath not blinded.
               
                  I could héere fill vpp bookes, with recital of infinit particulers knowen to the worlde, and confessed by his enemies, which would séeme wonderfull vnto the reader, touchinge his munificence and woorkes of charitie, but the place serueth not, and parhaps it may héerafter be

declared by others. Nowe it shalbe enoughe to note only in two or thrée wordes, the deuersitie of wayes, wherby this holy man powreth out his liberalite to the néedye, and then let the indifferent reader iudge, whether it be likely, that he which estéemeth soe litle his owne, will vse extorsion for the spoyling of others.
               
                  There is a vertuous preacher in Italie, named Iulius Rasius Hortinus,
                  
                     Iulius Rasius Hortinus.
                   whoe about two yeares past, made certayn colections of things done in Rome. This man notethe that the Almes and charitable déedes of this Pope, are of two sortes, the one, certaine, firme, and standing, & openly knowen to the world: the other, secrete and vncertaine, geuen out only as occasions doe require. For the which notwithstanding, this Pope euerie yeare, layeth a side one hundrethe thowsand crownes, albeit manie times this sum is not sufficient for that purpose. He reckoneth vpp manie perticulers to proue this his saying,
                     The Popes extraordinarie deedes of charitye.
                   which I omitt. As for example, that within the space of fiue yeares, he gaue extraordinariely (besides his standing pensons to that purpose) aboue two hundred t
                     •
                  owsande

crownes to one good worke onlye, which was, to the reléefe of poore widdowes, and to the mariage of orphane girles and other, whiche without that helpe had bene in daunger to haue fallen (for néede), to a lewde kinde of life. The like occasions are innumerable wherin his ayde is demaunded, as in the often necessities of pilgrimes that come to that cittie: of Christians taken by the Turkes and Moores: of poore people fallinge into miserie within his dominions, and also for the faythe abroade: of hospitales, religious howses, Churches, Colleges, schooles, confraternities, and the like: which all in their néedes, make recourse vnto him and are neuer reiected without some reléefe.
               
                  But nowe for his certaine and standinge woorkes of mercye, they are farre greater without all comparisone. For first as Rasius notethe,
                     Ca. de principum vita.
                   there are aboue thrée thowsand parsons which haue their dailye maintenance out of his palace of Vatican,

                   wherof verye fewe are his owne seruantes, for that they haue their standinge wages besydes, but they are

but they are such, as liue abrode in the citie, and receaue thence, euerie seconde day, their portions of bread wyne and raw fleshe, to the valew of a crowne a wéeke, for which purpose the Pope, besides the wines of his owne dominions, buyeth euery yeare, a thowsand and fiue hundred butts of wine out of the Kingdome of Naples, whereof the Kinge Catholicke geueth him the custome. Besids this, the numbers are maruelous of English men,
                     Straungers releeued.
                   Irish men, Scotts, Flemings, Germās, Hungariās, Slauons, Gréeks, Cypriotes and others: which being molested for their consciences at home, repayre to him for succour, whereof none are reiected, but all holpen accordinge to their necessities and his abilitie, as some of them haue 30. crownes a moneth, some 20., some 15., some 10, some 6, and none lesse then 4., which I haue hard of.
               
                  Besides all this, are his standing pensions to hospitalls, and to sundry orders of poore religious howses, which beinge in great multituds, must néedes be very chargeable vnto him, especially his munificence being, to geue so abundantlye as he doth, and such liberal portions: for

I vnderstand of one religious howse only in that citie, which receaueth yearely from him aboue 5000. crownes in ordinarie almes, besides all other.
               
                  After this, are schooles and learned men,
                     Vniuersities & learned mē
                     
                   maintayned by him in dyuers places, but principally in his vniuersities of Rome, Bononie, and Perusium. For example: in Rome, he hath Muretus,
                     Muretus.
                   and in Bonony, Sigonius,
                     Sigonius.
                   both men of great name, and intertained by him with seuerall stipendes, of litle lesse soome then of 1000
                     •
                   crownes yearly. The other readers also of these vniuersities, are many, and very sufficient, depending, all, or the most parte, of the Popes exhibition: as in Rome, there are 30. readers in the Colldge named Sapientia,
                  
                     Rasius cap. de colleg.
                   and the meanest of them, hath yearely for his lecture 100. crownes: and the most, much more. And besides these, he geueth very large entertaynment, to many learned men of all professions in Rome it selfe, as Deuines, Lawyers, Oratours, Poetes, Antiquaries, Gretians, Hebritians, Arabians, and Sirians, which remayne there for the ornamente of that citie.
               
                  
                  Last of all, and aboue all, are his Seminaries, and Colledges which he hath erected and founded vpon his owne charges, for the vertuous trayninge vppe of youth, as well in other countries as in his owne.
                     Seminaries in Rome.
                   And in Rome, the Seminaries are manye which he hath erected. Wherof the first is Seminarium Germanicum:
                  
                     Germanicū
                     
                   for the vse of Germans, which cost him 37. thowsand crownes, the first yeare, and now hath endewed it with twelue thowsande crownes a yeare, of annuall rentes. The seconde is,
                     Hebreum.
                   
                  Seminarium Hebraicum for the vse of yonge Iewes, conuerted to the fayth, wherein they are brought vppe in exacte studie of diuinitie in the Hebrew tongue, vnder Christian Rabbines, for the confutinge of their nation, when they come to be of sufficient 
                     •
                  nowledge. The thyrde is, Seminarium Grecum,
                  
                     Grecum.
                   wherein the children of the Gréekes are brought vppe, gathered from dyuers partes of the worlde, and are instructed by learned men of their owne language, together with the latine tongue, for the confutinge of their countries errours, and for the conuertinge of such iufidells, as

liue there amongest them. The fourthe is, Seminarium Anglicanum,
                  
                     Anglicanū.
                   for Englishe men onelye. The fifte is, Seminarium Hungaricum,
                  
                     Hungaricū.
                   for Hungarians and Slauons. The sixte is, Seminarium Belgicum,
                  
                     Belgicum.
                   newlye begoone for Fleminges. The last is, Seminarium Romanum,
                  
                     Romanū.
                   for the Italians, wherein their is greate stoare of most goodlye youth, albeit the most parte of this Seminarye liue not of the Popes charges, and this is all with in Rome it selfe.
               
                  But nowe, if we looke into other countryes, this Pope hath manye more monumentes of his munificence,

                   the Scottishe men in Paris:
                     Paris.

                   and in dyuers other places hath he the lyke, espesially in Germanie, which nowe I doe not remember. But it shal be sufficient to haue named these, for here hence we may gather a coniecture of the reste.
               
                  
                  Now then, this being soe, let the vnpartial Reader iudge, how likely a matter it is, that this Pope disboursing his owne so abundantly abrode, will pelfe vniustly from other men at home, as his scoller Iohn Nicolls, for good will, accuseth him.
               
                  Noe, noe, this slaunder hath no iote of lykelihood, as I noted before, but was vttered for customes sake, & for pleasing of their humours, whoe féede of reproch against the sea of Rome, and against the man sitting there, whatsoeuer. God geue them his grace, for the

                  I woulde here ende, to speake of the Pope, but that I am enforced to adde a worde or two, towching an impertinent quarrell, which Iohn Nicols picketh to him, for his Pontificalitie, that is, for the reuerence which Christians in respect of his rowme and dignitie, exhibite vnto him, which beinge in deade a very reasonable thing, and such as may be geuen without flattery, and receaued with out pride: yet the malice and enuie of heretiques can not beare it, but in greate

                  eate of speach they inueigh agynst it.
               
                  
                  Iohn Nicols, here towcheth two pointes: the one, that men knéele downe
                     •
                   as he passeth by: the other, that he is borne vpon mens shoulders, of both which I will speake.
               
                  And for the first I answere,
                     Kneling doū

                   that séeinge we knéele downe to temporal princes and gouernours, in respecte onely of the high gouernour, whom they represent, not expecting any thing from them excepte temporall commodities: much more of righte may we knéele downe to a spiritual magistrate, whoe gouerneth by a higher title, thē the temporal doeth, for that, he is the instrument and ang

                  ll of God, by whom al heauenly giftes and benedictiōs are deriued vnto vs. He succéedeth in the place of Adam, Enoch, Noe, Abrahā, Melchisedech, Isaac, & Iacob, of moyses and Aaron, of all the holy Prophetes, of Christ and his Apostles, to delyuer Gods blessings vnto vs, if we humbly séeke the same. For which cause, it hath alwaies bene the fashion of Christians, to aske with humilitie the benediction of priestes, and if of all priestes: then much more of the highest Priest of all. And this is the cause whye men doe

knéele downe vnto the Pope, not to addore him, as malice slaundereth, but to reuerēce him in honour of Christ, whose person he beareth, and to receaue by him Christ his benediction, whose rowme he possesseth.
               
                  This I saye is the cause whye men knéele downe vnto him, which thinge, whosoeuer reprehendeth, must néeds doe it more of enuie then of reason, séeing he cannot but graunte, that some honour is to be geuē vnto him which blesseth another, for that S. Paul sayeth:
                     Heb. 7.
                   That the better alwaies blesseth the lesser. And of reason, we must néedes thinke, that the blessinges mentioned in the scripture as receaued at mens handes, for example of Melchisedech by Abraham,
                     Gen. 14.

                  The matter standeth thus: At certaine principall feastes of the Church, the Pope vsethe to leaue his priuate chappell, and to come d

                   At which time such greate multitudes of people expecte him théere, to receaue his benediction, and verye manye also, to sée him,

whiche neuer sawe him before, beinge strangers & come from farr countries to visite thos holy places: as it is impossible for him to passe in, and out, thoroughe the preasse, and to be seene to geue his benadiction to all, excepte he should ether ride or be borne in his chayre. And to ride, it were very vnséemly and inconuenient, hauing to passe thorough all S. Peters great church, where the moste preasse is, and also for the passages of stones and steres. Wherfore they haue vsed alwayes, to lyfte him vpp in his chayre, and soe to conuaye him thorough the multitude, and this is all the matter, which is soe much exclaymed at. Which notwithstanding, being done vppon such considerations and necessities as I haue saide (for at all other times he goeth on foote or rideth) it rather noteth malice in them that maligne it, then conuincethe pride in him that admitteth it, or anye faulte at all in the wel meaning Christians, who vppon soe iust causes doe both

                     •
                  siciently with a No. But for that I wil not imitate his slanderous maner of dealing, I meane to add proofe and reason to my Noe. Yet, first I am enforced to complaine of some other men, whose wisdom or grauitey should haue stayed the publishinge of suche scurrilitie, as héere is put downe, against soe many honarable parsons, and some Princes also, without anie proofe or reason at all.
               
                  I doe apeale héerin, to the consciences of al modest and ciuil gentelmen, be they of what opinion in religion soeuer.
                     The publishing of Nicols scurrilitie against lawe both of nature and Nations.
                   Whether it be not against al lawe, both of nature and nations, and against the dignitie of our kinde, being men, to suffer soe shameles filthe, both lothsum and intollerable to any chaste eares, without all proofe, to be caste out against soe noble parsonages, which neuer offended vs, and to be published in printe, to the vewe of the worlde. If some wicked mann should aduenture the like against vs

                   in

other countries, and should set downe such particulariteis of dishonestie, ether heard, or deuised, against our Nobilitie and Maiestrates, and shoulde offer to printe it: would not very natural shamfastnes cause men to suppresse it, were they neuer soe contrarie in religion? yes surely. For there is humane respecte to be vsed, euen towardes our enemies.
               
                  Although therfore the base spirite of Nicols, shamed not to set abroche suche dregges of dishonestie, to the reproche of soe manie woorthy men: yet, me thinketh, respecte of common ciuilitie, should haue moued those, by whose allowance the matter passed, to haue stayed or qualified soe reprochfull infamies, powred out without certainty or ground of truth. For what doth he bring for proofe of his reproches, but only an vncertaine hearsay, & the reporte of a wandring seruing man, if it be true, as I think it false, that any such conferred with him. And is this sufficient to publish the auouchmēt, of y• infamous & horible crime, against al Cardinales without exception? The whole matter is quikly answered. For the first poynte is a méere supposall, suggested by enuie,

and vttered by malice. For the Cardinales kéepe noe suche b

The second poynt, is an improbable slaunder, for that Cardinales keepe no women at all in their howses, noe not their owne sisters. Nether shall a man see any woman repayre to any Cardinals howse, excepte vppon special knowen busines, in the companie of men, with whom they departe presently againe, and yet this thing is soe rare a matter also, as in mani

                  The third poynt, of the young Prince Cardinale, is an impudent and apparentlye, reprouable in the face of al ye worlde. For there was no young Prince Cardinal in Rome these manie yeares, but onlye about three yeares past,

Card. Sanseuerine, is protector of the Hebrew Nation, and of their Seminarie whiche they haue in Rome, wherof I haue spoken before.

Borrhomeo whom in gouernment and lyfe he séeketh to imitate.

                     Sesio. 23. cap. 1.
                  ) they are all of very good and exemplare life, as might be shewed in particulers, and by the most vertuous liues and deathes, of two late Cardinales arche Bishopes of Naples, and Augus

               Of Priestes and religious men.
               
                  Iohn Nicols accuseth the cleargie of Rome and Italie, in two thinges, the one of ignorāce, the other of dishonestie. For the first, he saythe: Their Priestes in Italie, are for the most parte vnlearned. I demanded of some of these Italian priestes, in the Italian tongue, wether God the Father and God the holye Ghoste, had bodies, they aunswered yea. Well then seeinge their priestes be ignorant & cet. Héere you sée, Iohn Nicols, borne in Cowbridge, vaunting ouer the Italian,

and condemninge him of doulfeshnes, which is some what more ridiculus, then the Ape scoffing at the fox, for wante of a tayle.
               
                  That the Italian priestes are cōmonly well learned,
                     Italian Priestes learned.
                   I could affirme of mine owne experience, and proue it also by the infinite bookes, which are daily set forth by them, in all sciences, but especially in their owne language, which they estéeme as muche as the latine, and haue 
                     •
                  urnished the same with all varietie of authores, which euer wrote commendably in anie tongue. But why Italian priestes, shonld not be so ignorant and vnlearned as Ihon Nicols reporteth, I could yeald many more resons, wherof the first and principal is, their great wit and capacitie, ioyned with a great desire of knowledge, and therin to excell all others. Which things, being cōpared with other helpes, wherof I will now speake, must néedes bring forth greater effecte of learninge, and learned men in Italie, then in other places where the lyke helpes are not.
               
                  And touching the helpes to learning,
                     Helpes to learning in Italie.
                   which Italians, besides their excellent

witt, haue aboue other men, they are manye. For first, in stead of our two vniuersities,
                     Vniuersities.
                   Cambridg and Oxforde, they haue their Pauia, their Padua, their Ferrara, their Bononie, their Siena, their Perugio, their Rome, their Salerno, their Naples, and some other vniuersities, besides their great scholes not much inferior to Uniuersities,
                     Schooles.
                   as Turin, Millan, Mantua, Brescia, Cremona, Uenice, Florence, Genua, Macerata, Aquila, Cosenza: and other places wher commonly the Iesuites doe reade. Also besides their prouinciall Seminaries,
                     Seminaries.
                   which according to the Coūcel

                   euerie Bishop that is able, hath in some towne within his dioces, which in Italie amounteth to be some hundrethes.
               
                  To this now, if we add their facilitie in obtaini
                     •
                  ge the latine tongue, by the vicinitie which it hath with their owne: also the varietie of all sciences written, or by translation, in the Italian tongue: also the greate store of learned men and teachers amongest them, and the continuall conference whiche they haue with learned straungers, who dayly come vnto them: lastly, the greate and often excercises

which Italian priestes haue, in preaching to their flockes, or expounding the Cathechisme euery sonnday and holy daye, according to the councel of Trent:
                     Ses. 24. ca.
                   we shal finde it very vnlikely that Italian priestes could not aunswer Iohn Nicols whether God the father & the holye Ghost, haue bodies or noe.
               
                  If there were any such matter talked of (as I dout very much): yet the error might eas
                     •
                  ly be cōmitted,
                     A probable ges

                        e of Nicols false reporte.
                   ether by them in not vnderstanding Ihon Nicols Italian, or by him in not perceauing their answer. For they mistaking his eydle demande (which no man but his like wold haue made) might answere him to a nother question of some discretion, saying: that God the father, and the holy Ghost, beinge without bodies, might nothwithstanding be represēted vnto vs in bodies, as God the father was represēted to Daniel,
                     Dan. 7. Math. 3.
                   in the shape of an ould man, and the holy Ghost to Ihon Baptist, in forme of a doue, & that the Church lawfully vseth the same now. This I saye, they might perhaps answer. But for the other question, wherof no childe in Italie is ignorante, it was as impossible for Italian

priestes to answer soe grosly, as it was easie for Iohn Nicols simplicitie to aske it, and for his malice to reporte it nowe in printe.
               
                  The second thing which Nicols obiecteth against Italian priestes, and especially them of Rome, is dishonestie in life, which he proueth not but only, by his accustomed waye of interrogation. And first of Monkes,
                     Ihon Nicols 
                           •
                        launder of monkes aunswered.
                   
                  Was there not (saith he) at Rome a whole monasterie of suche as beare a siluer crosse in their handes, and are appareled in blew, full of women, that went in habit of thes monkes, and were they not espyed at the last, and escaped vnpunished. To which I aunswer, there was noe suche thing, and all Rome will beare me witnes of the same, as also manye English men, which all Nicols time were there, and neuer heard mention of anie such enormitie. And it appeareth by that which he addeth. Of their vnpunishment after they were knowen, That all, is his owne inuention, for filling vp his booke, and flattering his exhibitors. For that such matters once knowen, escape not vnpunished in Rome,
                     Seuere iustice vppon a fryar.
                   apeareth well by the iustice done vppon a Spanish

fryer in his time, for a lesse matter then he reporteth, albeit in the same kinde: that is, he was publiquely hanged at the bridge of S. Angelo, for running out of Spaine with an other mans wise, which facte of his, was the onlye great offence heard of in Rome by any of his profession these manie yeres.
               
                  Noe lesse impious, is Nicols seconde slaunder againste all priestes, of Rome, where he saythe,
                     Nicols slaunder of Prieste
                           •
                         refuted.
                   
                  That they goe without punishment openlye to the stewes, and that he hath seene them with his eyes embracing the queanes. Which is soe false a slaunder as hath greatly to feare the saying of Scripture, which is,
                     Pro. 21.
                   
                  That a lying witnes, shall haue an euell ende. For it is soe salse, that suche thinges are practized or permitted publiquely in Rome, as the halfe of that whiche he reporteth, is sufficiente to depose any priest from his liuing in that place, and to suspende him from his function, and besides, to procure him selfe, halfe a dosen stretches of the Strappado,
                  
                     The strppado

                   which is greater punishment, then al cleargie men in England, would willinglye admitt for suche offences Wherfore his exclamation is ridiculus,

where he saythe. Oh if a minister heerin England should commit suche abhoemination and scape vnpunished, howe would you crye out & cet. This I saye, is ridiculus. For what their ministers doe commit in this kinde of sinne (notwithstandinge their owne wiues) wée heare and other men sée, and the worlde abroade can witnes, and howe seuerlye they are punished, some late exampels haue declared. And yet we crye not out, excepte to God alone: nor endeuour we to proclaime al in printe, & if we would, (as perhappes we maye héerafter beinge thus prouoked:) yet haue we truthe sufficient to put downe, & néede not damne our selues by lyeing, as Nicols séemeth resolued to doe.
               
                  I doe not defend all priestes in Rome for Saintes, as you will not, I think, al your ministers our reformers. But this I saye to the confu
                     •
                  ion of your malice, (which al indifferent men that know the place wil testifie with me,) that as lytle outward scandal is geuen in Rome, as in any one place of the worlde besides. To which I will add without detraction frō anye place, that I haue founde more inwarde

honestie, learning, zeale, religion, & deuotion, in seculer priestes of Rome, then in any place else of Christendome.
               
                  He that will make profe of this, lett him frequent the florentine congregatiō of seculer priestes,

                   at S. Ieroms church by the English Colledge, or at their new churche named Puzzo Bianco. Also lett him repaire to the Rosarie Congregatiō, at our Ladyes church Supra Mineruam, and he shall heare euery festiual day such spiritual excercises in those places, yt is, such lerned discorses on spiritual maters suche exhortations to vertue, such detestations of vice, such déepe considerations of our ende, and thinges belonging to our ende, of our accounte after death, of casualties in this life, and of our dewties in euery mans present estate: as is able to moue anye hard or stonnye hart. And all these excercises are done, by the seculer priestes of Rome, with greate payne, much studdye, and no small charges, and yet all this is voluntarie, and not by anye compulsion.
                     The effects of spirituall congregations in Rome.
                  
               
               
                  By meanes of these learned and zelous excercises, much good is done in Rome, vpon diuers persons which come to heare them, being of all sortes many,

both temporal and spiritual, and amōgst other, dyuers wilde yong gentlemen resorting thither, of curiositie to heare, are often times so pearsed by speaches vttered in those exercises, as they presently chaunge the order of their lyfe, & become most vertuous and sober the rest of their dayes. Soundrie great mutations of life are wrought also, in greater personages by helpe of the sayed exercises, which would neuer be, if the Romane priestes (whoe are doers in the same) were such wicked lyuers, as Iohn Nicolls affirmeth.
            
            
               Of the English students in Rome.
               
                  
                     Iohn Nicolls slaunder of ye students refuted.
                  
                  Iohn Nicols, to omit no part of a perfect Sicophant, picketh occasion of quarrels and detraction to his owne felow-students of the Romane Colledge, whoe neuer offēded him, but rather from whō he hath receaued great loue and curtesie. And because he had no fact to charg them withal, he inuented a very odious matter, which was malitious words against her Maiestie, and diuers of her honorable counsayle: also, against some other chéefe men in ecclesiasticall causes. The effecte of which wordes were, that they threatned,

forsoothe, the forsaide great parsonages, if euer ther came a contrarietime, to requite with rigor, the rigor nowe receaued. And pretending that he woulde not name the parsons soe threatened, yet childeshly he putteth downe the first letters of their names, and that with suche arte and secresie, as eche man may read it, and vnderstand it. Wherin he foloweth soe apparently his owne inuention or his enditers direction: as he nameth diuers men, whom, I dare auouche, noe student in that Colledge knoweth, and much lesse threateneth. But it séemethe that Iohn Nicols hath made a leag with hell,
                     Esa. 28. Psal. 138.
                   and therfore careth not how farre he wadeth in this waye of wickednes.
               
                  If he had put downe, anye particuler circumstances,
                     Ihon Nicols slaunder of the studentes refuted.
                   as proofes of his accusation, it had bene easier to haue improued his falshold. But bringing nothing, but a bare assertion, I must refute him with a méere denial, vntill he bringeth furder proofes, only adding certaine likelyhods which indifferetly considered may leade the reader to the discouery of his malice. Wherof the first is, as I noted before, the naming of such men héere as are not

knowen to any of the seminarie. The second is, the naming of soe many as hardly could be talked of by them, or remembred by him. The third is, for that the times of méeting and talking together in the seminarie, are both rare and shorte, and commonly in the companie of some straungers, whoe vnderstanding not our matters or particuler men, geue occasion of other talke. To this now, if we add the malice of the reporter, and how manie other apparent vntruthes he hath vttered, and how many absurde contradictions, hath and shalbe, gathered out of his owne wordes, and howe easie & plausible a matter it was to deuise this thing at that time without controulmente: I d

                  ut not but the wiser sorte will quickly discrye the whole.
               
                  But I cannot lett passe without adding somwhat to that which toucheth her Maiestie in particuler. To whome I know thes vertuous studentes (notwithstanding this slanderous acusatiō) beare all dutiful good will and affection,
                     The studentes dutifull meaning towards her Maiestie.
                   excepting only their consciences in religion, whose conformitie they cannot frame, to her Maiesties procéedinges. This they

haue shewed in reuerēt spéeche to diuers of the contrarie religion, who hath bene with them in Rome, & are now England. And in shew of this, imediatly vppon the erection of their Colledge, they caused her Maiesties armes to be drawē verye fayre in gould, and with conuenient ornamentes erected them in the haul of the Colledg. In token of this also, they appoint certaine euery moneth to praye for her maiestie, and her counsaile in perticuler. The maner of which is this.
               
                  In the begining of euery moneth, they come all together in their haul, and there after some prayer made, ech man taketh by lot, a litle scrol of paper, wherin thrée thinges are written.

                   for soe they vse to write, and to reade it alowde in the hearing of all men, and this Iohn Nicols cannot denye. which thing the studentes would neuer vse to doe, if they were so malitiously minded towardes her Maiestie, as he falsly reporteth.
               
                  Now touching the excomunication of her Maiestie by, Pius Quintus, which Nicols malitiously accuseth the studentes,
                     The studentes cleered about the excomunication.
                   
                  To haue renued againe at midsomer last, was twelue moneth, & to haue published at Rome & Rhemes by fixing them vpon pillers, & by sending them thorough out Italie, Spaine, and a parte of Germanie. There is no one parte true, but al is mistaken & spitfully peruerted: for the matter was only thus. In Christmas wéeke was tweluemoneth, Anno 1580. there were founde in Rome certaine coppies, of the sayd excomunication, and sente to the Bishop of S. Assaphe by Car. Allexandrino,
                  
which coppies the sayd Bishope suppressed, for any thing that we know, nether was it knowen whether the sayd coppies were of the oulde printe of Pius Quintus his time, or printed since.
               
                  Now the studentes of the Seminarie are wrongfully charged by Ihon Nicols in all these pointes.
                     Nicols greate malice in matter of death against his felowes.
                   First, for renewing the same: for they renewed them not, nor can any man affirme whether they were newe printed or no. Secondly, that they published them on pillers at Rome and Rhemes: for there was noe such publication made at all, and the studentes neuer sawe within the Seminarie any such coppies, for the matter was secretly suppressed, as I haue hard said, and scarse anye man knew of it in Rome it selfe, by whiche also appéerethe howe vniustlye they are accused to haue dispersed them, thoroughout Italie and Spaine &c, séeing no such copyes euer came to their hands.
            
            
               Of perticuler parsons.
               
                  The particuler parsons wronged by Ihon Nicols are diuers, but I wil touch only the principal. First,
                     Nicols slaunder of two lerned men.
                   he reprocheth two excellent learned men, thone M. D. Allen, the other, Iacobus Pais, reader

of diuinitie in Rome, saying that, D. Allen demaunded whether we mighte not worship the timber whereof the image is made, as wel as the thing represēted? And that ye other answered, yes: which slaūder is so grosse, as it néedeth no further cōfutatiō, but onely to name the men of whō it is made, for their opiniōs are extāt to the contrarie, as shall more appeare in handling the thyrd part of this answere.
               
                  Not beinge contēted to haue iniured Father Pais, with this absurd report, he procéedeth to charg him & his fellow readers, with much more odious matter. For of Pais he saieth: yt he vttered these words in latine in presence of 300 schollers.
                     Nicolls slaunder of Fa
                           •
                         Pais refuted.
                   
                  The Popes good wil is tried & knowen, and his purse is redie: but ether feare withdraweth King Philip, or power forbiddeth him, so that he dareth not to cō
                     uay his armie into Englande.
               
               
                  For answere wherof, I say, that albeit, it be not easie to cōuince apparantlye a shamelesse liar, talking of matters past, & in farre coūtries, especially to vs who haue no accesse to pleade for 
                     •
                  ur selues, nor course of iustice to examin our cause: yet by such meanes as in this case a
                     •
                   possible, I wil proue this report false & malicious.
               
                  First, for that Iohn Nicols being noe scholler nor hearer of Fa. Pais, but alwaies present at an other lecture of Petrus Gābacurta, reader in cases of consciēce, the same hower wherin Pais did read, could not heare Pais to vtter these words, which he faineth him to haue spoken in his lecture to the schollers: nether is it probable that he hard thē by reporte of other, for then would he haue named both the man and the circumstances, which he nether doth nor can doe.
               
                  Secondly, F. Pais being a priuate religious man, attending only his lecture, & dealing nether with Court nor courtiers,
                     Euident con
                           •
                        iectures.
                   could hardly come to vnderstād so secret meaninges of great Princes, & if he had knowē any such thing, it is not likely that he would haue proclaimed it in a publicke schole, where no occasion could be geuen of such matters, especially in particuler princes. And if his owne wisdome could not haue direc
                     •
                  ed him in this yet ye respecte of his superiours in ye Societie, would haue restrained him, whoe seuerelye interdicteth to their readers and preachers all mention or glauncing at matters of particuler Princes 
                     •
                  siats.

But what doe I stand to confute by circumstances soe manifest an vntruth? the matter is easie to be tryed. There are 3. or 4. priests in prison lately come from Rome, who for dyuers yéeres haue bene hearers, and haue missed no one lecture which Pais redde, but haue receaued all in wrytinge: let their dictates be séene, and if that be not sufficient, let them be demaunded vpon their othes, whether euer they hard Pais saye any such thinge. Let Nicolls come before them, and laye downe the particulers, and by all those wayes he shalbe proued a slaunderer.
               
                  After this Iohn Nicols, as now contemning al,
                     Prouer. 18. Psal. 56. Psal. 13.
                   being entered (as it séemeth) to the depth of iniquitie, and making his tongue a sharpe swoorde, and his throtte an open sepulchre, to woonde and burie whom soeuer he pleaseth: passeth on to fowler reproch, which is: That a Reader in positiue diuinitie in Rome, should say in the hearing of 200. scollers, that any man of worship in England, might geue authoritie to the vilest wretch that is, to seeke the death of our Soueraine Quene. But this venemous darte I wil repell as the other before, by the vnlykelyhods

of time, place, matter and persons: and by the testimonies of those priestes now prisoners in England, whoe must needs haue bene presente at the wordes, if any such had bene vttered by their reader. Which preistes being many, and superiours to Nicols in all respectes, both of age, descretion, honestie and learninge, ought to counteruaile his onely assertion. Besids this, if Nicols wil put downe the time and occasion of his spéeche, and also name the reader (for there are but two in positiue diuinitie that is, Robertus Bellarminius in controuersies,

                  under: for these learned and sober men, are so farre of from such desperate points of doctrine: as the plaine contrarie hath often times bene harde from them, and may also be gathered out of their seuerall dictates now extant in Englande, especially out of the dictats of ther fellow readers in scolastical diuinitie, I meane Achilles Galiardus,
                  
                     Galiardus.

                  All which being so, it appeareth that Nicols reports haue no truth or groūd, but were onely deuised by him selfe,

And

for Nicolls, I can geue him noe better counsayle, then to meditate at his leasure these two verses, vttered by the holy Ghost.

               Of Rome.
               
                  Nowe come I to the greatest eye sore of our aduersaries, which is Rome, a Citie that yéeldeth greate matter of talke, and furnisheth not onelye our bookes to the printe, but also our pulpittes and tables in Englande. Whatsoeuer is amisse in Rome, ouerthroweth our Catholique and Romane religion. As though our faith depended of those crased walles, so often beatē downe & possessed by the enimie,
                     If Rome were moste wicked, yet were it no pre
                           •
                        udice to Romane religion.
                   without hurt or blow to the religiō of Rome: or as though, if that citie were destroied or soonk: ye Bishoprick of Rome might not remaine, & ye Bishop stil head of Christs Church, albeit he were in India & dwelt in a barne: or, to come néere to our purpose, as though,
                     1. Pet. 5. Apoc. 18.
                   if Rome were ye wickedst citie vnder heauē (as it was whē S. Peter & S. Iohn called it Babilō
                  
yet Christian religion might not be good in it, as it was at that time, whē it was Babilō,
                     Rom. 1.
                   For euen at that time, S. Paul commended the true and holye faith of a wicked Rome.
                     Au. li. 2, cōt. lit. Petil. ca. 51. Itē ep. 16 5. ad Gene.
                   Wherefore this is but a point of a wrangling hereticke (as hath bene noted many hundred yeares agoe) to condemne the fayth, because of the place: the Sée Apostolicke, for the vices of the citie: the substitute of God, for the frailtie of a man: and Moyses chayre, for the lyfe of a Pharasée.
               
                  But yet in truth let vs sée, what they bring against the Citie of Rome, for I deny not, but as in a great and populous citie their must néedes many sinnes and faultes be cōmitted: and that (I thinke) our aduersaries will not deny also, in their most reformed cities of Englande.
               
                  But the question is, of the publique face and gouerment of Rome, which our aduersaries, for the slaunder of our religion, declare to be permitted in all kinde of vice and licencious liuing, which is not soe:
                     Rome lesse reproueable thē other Cities.
                   for as ther be some euil there, so are there many good, and more examples of vertue in that Citie, then in any place els of the worlde whatsoeuer, as by that

which I will saye more cléerely shal appeare. And first, as I did before aboute the Cardinals and priestes, I wil refute Iohn Nicolls particuler slaunders, and afterwarde shew the contrarie vertues.
               
                  Nicolls therefore,
                     Nicolles firste slaunder of Romanes answered.
                   beginneth by demaunding, as before he vsed to doe (for other proofe he hath none) How doe the Citizens (of Rome) lyue (sayeth he)? was there not lately a great riche citizen, that had a place to the which resorted manye yong Romane gentlemen, who committed the sinne of Sodome one with an other? and were they not spied out at the last? & did not they al scape punishmēt, except one pore man which died for al? & did not the Romanes saye that he died wrongfully? for that the sinne of Sodome was but a tricke of youth? For answering this, I wil beginne with that which is last: what soeuer some poore abiect in Rome might tel Iohn Nicols in familiaritie, of the lightnes of this detestable sinne: (for no man of witt would ether say so, or confer with Nicols about such matters) yet, it appeareth by him selfe yt it is not so tawght ther, nor so takē by ye magistrate which inflicted death vpō one

for the same. The which thing, albeit he confesseth: yet, as his fashion is, he ether grosely mistakethe, or peruerteh impudently, a matter done and knowen in the sighte of the worlde, and reproueable by as many, as weare then in Rome. For the thing touched not any Citizen or Romane young gentleman as he forgethe, but thus. Ther were seuen lewd roges, some spaniardes, some frenche men, and some Italians, that méeting some times in grottes or caues, without the wales o

                   and afterwarde burned to ashes at the place where the facte was espied, in the sight of more (I thinke) then twentie thowsand people: by which maye be conceaued, Nicols honestie in the rest.

                  But he goeth on against Rome, sayinge. What murder is there? insomuche that noe man can sitt in his wagon without daunger of life. It may be, that sitting

in wagons is dangerous in Rome, for I neuer sawe any man ride in them there, except it were comming out of the countrie, but in Coches you may sée fiue hundred euery day riding vp and down, with out danger of life or any other hurt. And I neuer heard of any in our dayes which were assalted in their Coches, but onlye, aboute twelue monethe agoe, or more, there was agoodlye frenche gentleman, sonne and heyre, to the Countie De la Ponte,

                   whoe hauinge enemitie with a certayne Italian rider, belonging to the Cardinal Altems, was chalenged by the sayd Cauallarizzo or rider and his companions, as he passed the stréetes in his coche, wheruppon the sayde frenche man and his seruantes and compagnions isshewinge forth to figthe: was soone after slayne, to the greate discumforte of the Cittie, and gréefe of the Pope, as appeared by the dilligence vsed in apprehending the malefactour. For albeit certaine Romaine gentlemen, had conueied him out of the cittie: yet was he gotten againe, and after diuers tormentes, excecuted. Soe that I sée not what this acte can make against Rome.

And be ther not thorough out all Rome Queanes, whoe laye out of their windows carpets, & their gowens, which is a signe to them that passe by that there they maye haue a woman for monye. At shrouetid, what horrible abuses are there practised at Rome without punishment, doe not men goe in womens apparell, the gentle women out of their windowes throw rose water, which is a token to thē that passe by, th
                        •
                     t there they maye defile their bodies one with an other. Héere Nicols hudleth a gret dele of malice against Rome, and proueth it only by his accustomed bare interrogation. To which I shall make sufficient aunswer by gathering out only the seueral lyes, vttered in these fewe lynes, whiche are in number no fewer then eyght.
               
                  
                     Eighte vntruthes in one reporte.
                  
                  For first, it is false that Rome hathe six stréetes of Curtezans, for it hath but one, wherof I will speake more at large presently. Secondly it is false that these Curtezans pay tribute to the Pope, and

if they did (as they doe not) yet were it a punishment, and not an allowance of their life, as when you make a Catholique paye monie for his not cominge to churche, you doe not alowe therby of his absence, but you punish him for it. Thirdly it is false, that there are queanes thorough out all Rome: for if any bée taken out of that one stréete, named Burdello, she is presētly whipped about the town. Fowerthly, it is false, that they are dishonest women whoe hang out their Carpets and gowens at their windowes: for hauing noe gardens to ayer their clothes in, they vse to hang out the same at their garret windowes, as also in London they are accustomed to doe. Fiftly, it is false, that horrible abuses are practized in Rome at shrouetide, for in this Popes time, ther are permitted no other pastimes, to be spoken of, at shrouetide, but only running with horse, an olde excersise of the getlemen Romans. At wich acte notwithstanding, there wante not some religious men, euery yeare to be present, and by occation of that greate assembly, to speake some thing of edification to them. And as for maskes or other

dishonest sportes, they haue not at al permitted. Sirthly, it is a shamles lye, that m

                  ̄ goe in womens apparel & women in mens, at that time. Seuenthly, it is false, that al gentlewomen doe vse to cast out rosewater vpon goers by, at y• time: for they are only certaine that dwel néere to the course of the horses, where great repaire is. Lastly, it is a malitious slaunder, that such water is cast out in token of dishonestie. For the best & noblest personages vse to doe it, vpon their frendes as they come to sée the course of the horsmen, & not for dishonest meaning, as Ihō Nicols interpreteth. So that, be ye things neuer so honest or lawful of them selues, this man draweth all to a corrupt meaning as you see.

                  But héere, before I passe any furder, I must say a word or two touching the stewes in Rome, the permission wherof by ye Pope, & by other Catholike Princes in their coūtries, is accounted so heinous a matter by our aduersaries, as it may not be answered, but yt we therby alow of vnchast life. Which is a most false & wrongfull charge, as may apéere by that which foloweth. First the Pope, with al Catholiques

that euer wrot, condemneth & detesteth the acte of simple fornication, as a deadly sine, & dānable to the doers, without repētance.

                  nce, tollerat or permit this sinn in some degrée, without fault,
                     Tolleratinge of stewes noe alowinge of them.
                   & without any alowing of the sinne it selfe. As God doth tollerat with wicked men and with many wicked actes in ye world, which he detesteth, & might, notwithstāding, let thē if he would: & yet he dothe not alowe of thē for that he permitteth them. Thirdly that a naughty & wicked thing may somtimes be necessary, & consequently tollerated without fault. (the corruption and lewd inclinatiō of men supposed) It apereth plainly by S. Paul, who saith,
                     1. Cor. 11. Math. 18.
                   yt heresies of necessitie must be: & by Christ, who affirmeth that scandals must néedes come, & yet nether Christ alowed of scandals, nor S. Paul of heresies. Fowerthly I might aske, why ye protestants in England, doe permit vsery by their lawes, yt is, doth not punish men for taking vnder ten of the hundreth?

They must néedes aunswere that they allowe not of the sinne, but that they doe it for the auoiding of a greater inconuenience, which is, leste by punishing all vsurie (as the Catholique Church dothe) no man would lende any monye at all.
               
                  
                     The causes why the stewes is permitted.
                  
                  Soe then the Pope, and other Christian Princes, for the auoidinge of a greater inconuenience, séeing the corruption of some men wil alwayes be such, as beinge restrained of this, would breake to worse matters: and hauing learned by longe experience, (as S. Austen affirmed also of his time) that if this publique sink should be taken away, the infection wold rushe into priuate howses: (as in parte (I thinke) may be noted in our own coū
                  trie, if we compare the chastitie of our fathers dayes, when such a place was permitted, with the times which haue followed since the taking away therof): considering also, that the tolleratinge with this publique sinke, is no wayes any allowance of the sinne: for these causes, I say, Christian Maiestrates, haue alwaies permitted this publique scandal, protesting to their subiectes, by the words of S. Ierome, which he vseth in a like matter,

vppon Christes wordes.
                     Li. 3. comment. in math. 18.
                   
                  It is of necessitie that scandals should come, but yet, woe to that man, which by his faulte maketh that to be, which otherwise in the world must needes be. That is to say, of necessitie there must, for causes, a stewes be permited, but yet woe vnto him whiche haunteh the stewes, or vseth this permission. Soe that the thing is permitted of necessitie in general, but no mans going thither, alowed in particuler.
               
                  Wherof it commeth, that there is no prince in the world which doth or can vse more meanes, then the Pope dothe,
                     Meanes vsed by the Pope for withdrawing lewde women from their naughty lyfe.
                   to draw al men from that vice, & to reforme thos miserable women thēselues, which liue in that kind of life in his dominions. For first, they are shut vp in one stréete, with a note of infamie, not only to them selues, but to all those who repaire vnto them. Sec
                     •
                  ndly, they are debarred of all spiritual cōsolation, for they remaine vnable to receaue any sacramēt, as long as they abide in yt trade of life. Thirdly, they are depriued of al credit or countenāce in ye world abrode, so that, if any of thē shold be found in a Coche, both horses & Coche are, ipso facto, forfeited Fowerthly, they

make no testamēt, except they haue lawful childrē, but al their goodes must goe to ye conuertites,
                     Conuertites.
                   that is, to thos which are conuerted from yt kinde of abhominable life. Fiftly, ye Pope causeth euery wéeke, some religious men to repaire to yt place & ther in the middest of ye stréete, to prech hell & dānation vnto them for their wickednes. And lastly, he hath prouided a goodly monastery for all thē, which wil leaue yt state, to enter into, & ther to be maintained whiles they liue, with a very competent & sufficient prouision of an honest & vertuous life. By which meanes, diuers are recalled daily from their wickednes. Which thinges being so, let ye indifferēt reader iudge, how vniustly the Pope is charged with alowing of ther lewd behauiour, as God, whoe is not partial, will one daye declare.
               
                  Thus, hauing answerd Ihō Nicols vntrue & slanderous reportes of the citie of Rome, it shal not be amisse, according to my promise, to bestow sōe few words in declaring ye pietie, of this cittie, which euery man yt hath séene it, & is not blinded with partialitie, wil easily confesse, to be greater, then in any place of ye world besides. And first, in talking of ye chéefe head

head, ye Pope himselfe, & of the Cardnals, I haue shewed how for matters of learning it doth excel, hauing in it,
                     The multitud of studentes
                   Seminaries & colledges of al nations & tongues, also two distinct Uniuersities, as I may terme thē, for besides the scholes of Sapientia, wher 30. sundery learned men doe reade, the Iesuites schooles haue aboue 1200. shollers which frequent thē, besides the studentes of lawe in ye colledge of Capronica,
                  
                     Capronica.
                   & besids ye great howses of religion, wher also are learned readers, & haue often publike excercises of disputation one with another, to the great commoditye of all studentes in that place.
               
                  After this, in my spéech of the priestes & clergie of Rome,
                     Congregations in Rome.
                   I shewed what cōgregatiōs & conferēces they haue in spiritual matters, to ye great instruction & edification of all straūgers that repaire thither. In which kinde of pietie, I touched but ye leste part, for besides thos congregations yt I named, ther ar diuers others, & wher as the nūber of Societies or Cōpagnies of seculer men in Rome,
                     80. Societies in Rome.
                   amoūt to aboue 80. theris neuer

                     •
                   they haue cōference in spirituall matters.
               
                  
                  Now then, to passe ouer to the déedes of pietie which are corporal, and which appertaine more in particuler to ye Citizens them selues, I must say generally that there is noe good worke of charitie, that may be deuised, which is not exercised amonge the Citizens of Rome. For proofe whereof, we haue to consider, that all néede commonly is founde in one of these 7 sorts of people,
                     Seuen kindes of men vppon whom ye Romans vse principallye their charitie.
                   and consequently charitie to be shewed vpon them, that is to say: children, sicke folkes, straungers, prisoners, oppressed with debte, oppressed with sinne, and adiudged to dye. Upon all these, doe the Romanes exercise their déeds of charitie in great abundāce.

                  And first for children, the company of the holye Ghoste receaueth as many Infantes, as come, and because many are ashamed to bring their infantes thyther openly, there is a secret place wher they may lay them downe and not be séene, so that the multitude of infantes which are brought, is very greate, and commonlye neuer lesse then 200. and the number of Nurces there continually mayntained, is neuer fewer then 100. Besides this societie, there is another howse appointed

for Orphan boyes, in Antonines bathes,
                     Thermae Antonini.
                   and another for Orphan maydes, in another place named gli quattro Coronati, and ech howse receaueth 
                     •
                  00. All which children cominge to ripe age, are distributed into two sortes, the boyes, some to learninge, and some to handiecraftes: the maydes, some chuse to enter into Monasteries, and the rest haue portions allotted them to be married away, as shalbe shewed more hereafter.
               
                  For sicke men,
                     Sicke folkes.
                   the prouision of Rome is maruelous. For besids the hospitalls which ech Nation hath there, seuerally, the Romanes haue made great prouision for all sicke men by their hospitalls,
                     Hospitalles in Rome.
                   which in number are many, but fower doe excell aboue the reste. If a man haue an ague, then he may goe to the hospitall of S. Spirite,
                     S Spiritus.
                   if he haue a freshe woonde or hurt, he may goe to the hospital of our Lady,

for nothing, as commōlie he could haue for his monie in the citie, or rather better, for which cause, many gentlemen doe remoue from their owne howses, to the hospitall of S. Spirite, for recouerie of their health: which hospital of S. Spirite hath commonlie noe lesse then 300. sicke persons in it, with goodlie partitions for men and women, gentlemen, and of the porer sorte. S. Iames his hospital receaueth in number 155. men, and 45. women: the other two hospitals receaue fewe lesse: all thinges are kept so swéete and cleane in these hospitals, that many noble women, Ladies and gentlewomen doe repaier often thither, to comefort the sicke, as also verie manie gentlemen, especiallie the holie daies, bringinge with them some what or other to present vnto the sicke people for their comefortes. These haspitals are thought to spende aboue 150. thowsande crownes by the yéere, which depende for the most parte vpon the almes of the Romanes.
               
                  
                     Straungers.
                  
                  Towching straungers the liberalitie of the Romans is very great, for besids the particuler hospitalls which are in Rome, for euerie countrie, there are diuers

hospitals of the Romanes, appointed out for the receite and reléefe of poore straungers.

                  gers: and some dayes they receaued 14. thowsande together, with aboundance notwithstanding, of meate and lodging, and with so good entreatie, as diuers noble & gentlemē of Rome, would repaire thither to serue ye saied Pilgrimes and to washe their féete for loue and deuotion.
               
                  For Prisoners,
                     Prisoners.
                   the care of ye Romans is singuler, aboue al other nations in the worlde.
                     Societas charitatis.
                   For they haue amongst them a companie named the companie of charity: which company, by licēce of the Pope doth chuse euery yéere, two officers for the reléefe of the prisoners, the one a protectour, who hath to defend ye poore prisoners yt are wrōged, by law or otherwise. The other a procter, whose office is, to make sufficiēt prouisiō for meat, drincke & other necessities for thē. Thes mē also doe sée, yt al things passe orderly in ye prisōs, & yt all ye prisōers haue diuine seruice said before thē daily: & yt ther come euery wéeke

once or twise, preachers, to preache vnto the sayed prisoners. Lastelye, that there be conuenient bookes of pietie and deuotion in euery prison, tyed with chaynes for all to reade: and that al books of scurrilitie and dishonestie, be remoued thēce, by which good meanes, and other vsed by them, many profite more in pietie by one monethes imprisonment, then they had done before, in many yéeres libertie.
               
                  
                     Men indebted
                  
                  For men indebted, the Romanes take very charitable order. For firste, they haue a greate bancke of monye, called mons pietatis,
                  
                     Mons Pietatis.
                   out of the which al banckrupts or other poore people may borrow mony without intrest, bringing a paune or sufficient sureties. Secondly, the company of charitie, by helpe of other Romanes do deliuer out 80. 
                     •
                  uery yéere, which are imprisoned for debt. Thirdly, the societie of S. Apostle, vseth to goe aboute the citie, and to enquire of poore gentlemen or gentlewomen whoe are behinde hand, and are ashamed to aske helpe, and if their debtes be not very excessiue, they séeke meanes to discharge them.
               
                  
                     Lyuers in opē sinne.
                  
                  Towchinge those that liue in sinne, & lewde lyfe, or are in daunger to fall into

the same, the Romanes do practise great pietie. For first, towching maydes destitute of frendes,
                     Occations of sinne how much shunned in Rome.
                   which for néede mighte fall vnto an euill trade of lyfe, they marrye euerie yéere of their owne charges aboue 500. as after shall appeare more in particuler. Other they place in monasteries, and 140. they maintaine from time to time in a howse named S. Catharins besides those which I named before. Secondly, for them that be married and can not agrée with their husbandes, and by that mea
                     •
                  es are in daunger to turne to dishonest lyfe, the Romanes haue builte a goodly monastery dedicated to S. Martha, and named it Delle Mal Maritate,
                  
                     Mal Maritate of S. Martha.
                   in which howse such yonge women may liue vertuously, vnder the gouernmēt of certaine graue Noones, vntil they be reconciled to their husbāds againe. Thirdlie, for them that are now dishonest and will be conuerted, they haue a howse to maintaine them in, as I noted before, called the howse of Conuertites.
                     The howse of Conuertites
                   Lastly, because, they which once enter into this howse, of Conuertites, maye not turne backe, or go fourth againe, but must perseuer there al their life, (which manie of

these dishonest womē can not at the first resolue them selues to doe.) Therfore haue the noble matrones of Rome procured another howse, called Casa pia,
                  
                     Casa pia.
                   behinde Pantheō, where these women may come for a time, to proue what they will resolue vppon, in which time, the sayed matrones,
                     The great care of ho

                   doe omitt no meanes to perswade them from all dishonestie for the time to come, and do offer to prouide for them by good seruices with vertuous gē
                  tle women, if they can not resolue them selues to enter into the monasterie of Conuertites, & by this meanes also many be reclaimed from wikednes & sinne.
               
                  
                     Men adiudged to dye.
                  
                  Concerning these which are adiudged to dye, the citizens of Rome doe shewe themselues very charitable & peitiful: for they haue amongest other, a Societie named the companie of mercie,
                     Societas mis
                           •

                           •
                        .
                   whoe receaue into their costodie, all such as are condemned to dye, towardes whom they vse all humanitie and gentle dealing, neuer leauinge them day nor nighte, vntil the time of executiō be past. If the prisoner haue any children, they promise him to take order for them, and soe they doe, as also for his debtes, if he be trowbled

with any: if he haue any enemies, they bring them vnto him to be reconciled: after that, they reade good bookes vnto him and cause vertuous men to preache and make exhortations to like effecte: they watche also with him, and cause praiers to be saied for him, and finallie they accompanie him to the place of executiō, & thēce receaue his body & burie it, causing certaine Masses to be saied for his soule.
               
                  These are the general points of ye good works done in Rome, which I haue touched bréefely, leauinge out many more things then I haue mentioned, for breuities sake. But he that would cōceaue the multitude of thes works, which ar done by ye Romanes, let him but read ye bookes of the Societies or companies in Rome, which being in nūber aboue 80. as I noted before, & euery societie, besids ye ordinary seruice of god, exercising some particuler good worke:
                     The cause of so many good workes in Rome.
                   it must néeds be that such good workes are many in Rome. I haue made mentiō before of y• societie of charitie, which haue care of prisōs, & of ye society of mercy, which taketh care of cō
                  demned men, and of some other Societies which haue care of Hospitalls: But yet those are not all the good déedes,

which those societies doe: for the societie of charitie doth besids geue 50. crownes a moneth, vnto ye Cōuertits, & doth marry 22. maids yéerly, geuing thē 30. crouns a péece wt new aparel: also it distributeth euery soūday great quātity of bread vnto the poore.
               
                  Now, if I shoulde speake of all other Societies,
                     strange liberalitie in marrying of mayds.
                   I should be to tedious. But yet by thes two or thrée wordes which I say of a fewe, you may iudge of the reste. The Societie of the Annūciata,
                  
                     La compagnia dell Anuonciata.
                   doe bury straungers and poore people which dye in Rome, causing masses to be saide for thē, and it marrieth euery yeare 180. maydes geuing eche of them 35. crownes, with new apparel. The Societie of the Conception,
                  
                     La compagnia della Concettione.
                   dothe marrye euerye yeare 30. maydes, geuinge them 20. crownes a péece with apparel. The Societie of S. Angelo, marieth euery yeare 20. maides, with 25. crownes a péece and apparell. The Societie of Confalones,
                  
                     La compagnia delli Confalonieri.
                   marriethe yearly an vncertaine number, with 18. crownes a péece and apparell. The Societie of Brescians, geueth 20. crownes. The Societie of Bononians, 35. crownes. The Societie of Neopolitās, 35. crownes

The other is, for that to dispute with Ihon Nicols in Controuersies, that is, with a grammarian in groundes of deuinitie: is as lost laboure, as to argue with Pedlers in pointes of Poetrie, or with a Colliar in cunning of Chiualrie. He vnderstandeth not the state of that which is in question, nor conceaueth the meaning of ether parte aright. The authors which he citeth, he neuer read, but tooke them vp at second hand in Englishe bookes where he fell vppon them, namely in those of Hanmer & of Philip of Mornay, whence often he boroweth whole pages together.

                  Fowrthly, the Catholicks doe deduce of the premisses that,
                     The true visible Church cannot erre.
                   if this trew visible Church of Christ, haue soe greate priuiledges from him, as to be his spouse, and his owne body, as is sayed before: also if no man can be saued but by repayringe to her, and obaying her direction: then is

it necessarie that Christ shoulde (according to his promise) soe gouerne her by his holy spirite,

                  Fifthly, Catholiques doe deduce out of the premisses, that séeing the knowledge & finding out of this true Church,
                     The necessitie of infallible mar
                           •
                        es to knowe the Churche.
                   is soe necessarie to all men, as hath bene sayd, and as noe man can be saued without it: it is certaine, that Christ hath left 
                     •
                  ome such manifest, sure, and infallible markes, to knowe this true Church and Congregation from all other congregations in the world, as no man maye be deceaued therin, excepte he will wilfully blinde him selfe. This is agréeable bothe to the mercy and iustice of Christ, whoe forsawe in his prouidence, the doutes that would rise about this matter. For which cause also S. Aus
                     •
                  en sayth.
                     Aug. in psal. 32.
                   
                  That the holy Prophetes spake more plainer of this Church, thē of christ him selfe. Foreseeing that more controuersies should rise about the Church, then about Christ &c.
                  
Of these markes therfore, we are nowe to entreate, so farre as Nicols geueth vs occasion. Which thing because it is of al other, of most importance, (for the true Church once found,
                     Why here
                           •
                        iques are soe angerie with the markes of the Churche.
                   all other controuersies are ended) the heretique striuethe moste in this pointe, to auoide the true markes, which descrye his estate, and to forge other markes, which are noe markes at all, nor any waye to be found in his church: but yet may be chalenged by him, and not soe euedently improued by the contrarie parte.
               
                  But for the examination bothe of his & our markes,
                     Three properties of true markes.
                   it is to be noted, that true markes of the Church, should haue these thrée cōditions or properties at the least. First, that the marke should be better knowen, and easier to be found out, then the thing marked by it. For otherwise it could be no good marke, being more, or no lesse obscure then the thing it selfe, which it ought to make manifest vnto vs. Secondly, that the marke be proper only to the thing marked, and not comon to many other, for thē it should no more make manifest the thing we séeke for, then any other. Thirdly, that the marke be suche,

as our forefathers vsed in the Primatiue Church, to proue their Church true, against heretickes. Now then, let vs examine bréefly both our marks, and those of our aduersaries, accordinge to these thrée properties and conditions
                     •
                  
               
               
                  Our aduersaries bring two principal markes,
                     Cal. li. 4. in. ca
                           •
                         1. num. 7. 8.9.
                   whereby they would haue the true Church to be tryed: the one is the true vse of Sacramentes: the other the true interpretatiō and preaching of God his word: which two thinges, alb
                     •
                  it they be pri
                     •
                  iledges of the true Church, and onely found in the same: yet, can they be no external markes to shew vnto vs the saied Church,
                     Heretical markes re
                           •
                        uted.
                   for that they want al those thrée properties of true markes before recited. For first, they are as vnknowen to vs as the thinge we séeke for: it being as hard and obscure, and as much in cō
                  trouersie, who doe preach the worde sincerely, and administer the Sacramentes aright, as it is, whi
                     •
                  h is the true Church. Secondly, these two thinges are not soe proper to the true Church, but that euery heretical congregation may and doth in the sight of the world, chalēg the same vnto it selfe, & consequētly it can not be a good marke to distinguishe their cōgregations

from the true Church. Thirdly the holy Fathers did neuer vse thes two marks against ye hereticks of their time, but rather did reiect thē when they were brought for marks by hereticks, as they are now:
                     Li. 3. ca. 19. de bap. con. Don. & ep. 48. ad Rog. li. 1. ca. 29. cont. Cresc.
                   as it may appeare by S. Austē in diuers places against the Donatists, Rogatistes, and other here
                     •
                  ickes, which did labour as he sayeth: That their error may be named truth, & ther wikednes iustice, for the sacramēts & scripturs which they hold for a shew & not to saluation.
               
               
                  The Catholickes on ye other side, doe alleag more certaine, easie and manifest marks, for trial of ye Church, which markes haue al ye properties before recited: & albeit they vse to bring 15. or 16

                  ueral notes or signes, al foūded in ye scripturs, by vew wherof it is most esie to discerne ye true Church from al other: yet for breuities sake I wil name only fower, thrée whereof are impugned by Iohn Nicolls in his booke.
               
                  The first marke is, yt the true Church is Catholicke, as our Créed teacheth vs:
                     
                        Catholicke.

                   which word S. Austē expoundeth thus. The Catholicke Church is that, which is spread ouer the whole world: & an other father not long a

                     •
                   And generally al the holy Fathers doe vse and vrge this marke, against all heretiques, prouing that church onlye to be the true church, which being planted by the Apostles and their successors, was spread ouer al partes of the world, or the chéefe partes therof: wherby it tooke the name of Catholique, and that all other congregations, which afterwarde began in corners, or by some one or fewe men contrarie to the more parte of Christianitie, can not be the true Church, but hereticall Sinagogues.
                     Li. de vtili. cre. cap. 7.
                   
                  Whereas there be many heresies amongest Christians (saith S. Austen) and all wil seeme to be catholiques, calling other men heretiques besides them selues: the Catholique Churche is but one, more plentifull in multitude if we consider the whole world, as al men will graunt. And againe.

                  If an Angel frō heauen should saye, leaue the Christianitie of the whole world, and hould the partes of Donatus: he ought to be accursed, for that he goeth about to cutt thee from the whole, and to thrust thee into a part.
                  
And againe.

                  Whatsoeuer Congregation of heresie, sitteth in a Corner, she is a harlot and noe mother. Now whether this marke agrée to our churche or theirs, let our aduersaries iudge.
               
                  The second marke of the true church is, Antiquitie.
                     Antiquitie.
                   For as God was before the diuel, and as the good séede was sowē in the gospel before the cockle:
                     Math. 13.
                   soe was Christ his true church, before al heresie, and al heresies haue sprong vp since our Catholique faithe was planted, whiche thing may be shewed in this māner.
                     See of this. Aug. li. cō. Ep. funda. cap. 4. Ierō. ep ad Pam. & Ocean. & dial. con. Lucif. Hillar. li. 6. de trin. ante medium.
                   For that in euery notable change or alteration of religion, these six thinges maye be shewed. First, the authore of that newe religion: secōdly, the new doctrine which he taught: thirdly, the time when he began: fowerthly, the place or coūtrie wher he began: fiftly, that some men resisted and impugned this newe doctrine at the beginning: sixthly that some other fewe men first began to embrace the same. And al these six thinges, we can shewe in euery heresie since Christes time, as also of the doctrine of our aduersaries. But they can neuer shewe the same of the beginning of our doctrine. And therfore, it appeareth

that their doctrine is new and h
                     •
                  retical, and ours auncient and Catholique. This argument of antiquitie, al the Fathers haue vsed against heretiques of their time.

                  What are you, (saith Tertuliā to certaine heretiques) whēce & whē came you? where haue you beene hidden soe longe?

                   And Optatus against Parmenian. Shew the beginning of your chayre which will challenge the holy Church vnto you.
               
               
                  The third marke vsed by the ould Fathers to know the true Church,
                     Succession.
                   is succession of Bishopes, frō the Apostles time, especially in the sea of Rome.
                     Lib. 3. con. her. cap. 3.
                   For so saieth Ireneus aboue 1300 yeares past, reconinge vpp all the Bishopes of Rome from S. Péeter vnto his time. And adding that by that succession of Bishopes, all heretiques were confounded. The same saythe Tertulian,
                     Lib. de prescrip.
                   
                  Let heretiques laye forthe the beginninge of their churches, let them tourne ouer the order of their Bishopes comminge doune by succession

                     •
                   faythe and confutation of heresie. The

like dothe Optatus and S. Augustine against the Donatistes.

                   Willing them to doe the like, if they meane to aquite them selues from heresie. And the reasone of this, is, for ye Christ, leauing his Churche to be gouerned by his Apostles, whiche were Bishopes, and they by their successors: whosoeuer came in afterward not by this lawfull and ordinarie dore, of ordination & succession,
                     Iohn. 10
                   except he bring extraordinarie proofe of his extraordinarie vocation, must néedes be a theef & a wolfe as Christe noteth, and as all heretiques haue bene, seeking to intrud them selues, by extraordinarie wayes, and meanes, starting vp in particuler countries, and making them selues gouerners, without anye lawfull calling.
               
                  The fowerth marke of the true church is vnitie & consent of doctrine.
                     4 Vnitie and consente.
                   For as ye deuill is authore of dissention, soe is God authore of vnitie and concord:
                     1 Cor. 14. Math. 12. Vide. Aug. Li. 18. de tri. Li. 52. & 41.
                   & the true Church being the bodye of Christ, & ruled by his holy spirite, which is alwaies one and the same, must néedes kepe one faith and one doctrine. And heretiques, beinge gouerned by the contrary spirit, must néedes change their opinions, as the malice

of that spirite changeth. For which cause the holy Fathers haue alwayes vsed this as an inuincible argument against heretiques. For that the Churche, hath indured soe manye ages in great varietie of times, and infinite men haue written in diuers countries, in diuers tongues, and vpon diuers occations. And yet in al thes writings they haue agréed in all pointes of faith soe manye hundred yeares together, which is a signe of one holy spirite gouerninge their doeinges from time to time. Contrariewise, heretiques, albeit they began but in some one countrie, yet could they neuer agrée any space of time in one opinion, but would range from one thinge to another, vntil by dissention, they were all extinguished again. Soe Ireneus writethe of the first heretique Simon Magus,

                   And of our age it is euident also, how many sectes haue begun since Luther. Fredericus Staphilus counsailer to the Emporoure,
                     Staph. li. de concor. Lu.
                   shewethe how Luthers schollers were quickly deuided into thrée sectes, that is, into Anabaptistes, Confessionistes, and Sacramentaries, and they againe sub-deuided into other sectes, insomuche that in his time they were 34. but nowe are manie more. Soe that by this marke it is easie to iudge whiche is the true Churche and which is the false
               Now then let vs examine, what Ihon Nicols obiecteth against these markes of the Church, which, although if be soe impertynente and ridyculous as it is not worthe a confutation: yet for the readers instructiō in their maner of dealing, I will saye a worde or two about it.
               
                  Against the first marke,
                     Nicols obiections againste the 
                           •
                        irst marke which is, Catholique fol. 25.
                   he obiectethe out of Exodus 23. Ne insist ito vestigys potē
                     tiorum ad mala. Follow not the stepes of stronger then thy selfe to doe yuel. which he translateth thus: Thou shalt not followe a multitude to doe yuell. Which is not according to the wordes put downe. And albeit, it be according to the wordes in the very text, yet is his fault double. First, to put down one thing in latine & and an other in English,
                     This tricke he vseth in many other places.
                   and secondly, to deuise latine wordes him selfe, which are not in the text. But to graun
                     •
                   this and al the rest which he bringeth against wicked multitudes, as of Turkes, Iewes, Infidels & heretiques,
                     Math. 7. & 24 Luc. 12.
                   which often times are more then the good: also that Christe his flock was smal in the beginning, & often oppressed after by persecuton:
                     Iereni. 18. Esa. 53.
                   & cet. What is this to ye purpose? we talke not of al multitudes but o
                     •
                   Christiās: nor of Christianitie in the beginning, but after it was spread ouer ye world: nor of vices in manners, but of error in faith. In res
                     •••
                  t therfore of Infidels & other wicked of the world. Christians are but few: & very mu
                     •
                  h fewer at the beginning in respect of the nomber which they are now:

& for manners, both now & then, the more parte parhapes licencious: but this is nothing to our question. For notwithstanding al this, we say,
                     Catholique and priuate.
                   that after Christian faith was once spread ouer the world, by the Apostles & their successors, and was receaued in vnitie by the followers therof, and therby named Catholique: whatsoeuer priuat Congregation began afterward among the said Christians, or shal doe to the worldes ende, teaching different doctrine from this first receaued general doctrine,
                     A sure marke to knowe an heretical Congregation.
                   and disagréeing to the vniversall multitude of Christianitie, (as Arrius Pelagius and Berengarius did in their times, and Luther in his:) this priuate Congregaton (I saye,) is conuicted to be heretical, by this first marke, of Catholique.
                     The Churche tried by Scripture.
                   Nether is that refuge of heretiques anye thinge worthe, when they saye, the Church muste be tryed by the Scripture: for we graunte that further forthe then they doe, and therfore wee bringe all oure markes out of the Scryptures, as by examyninge of them maye appeare.
               
                  
                  Against the seconde marke which is Antiquitie,
                     Nicols obiections agaynste Antiquitie Fol. 22.
                   Nicols obiecteth out of Iob 32. Old men doe not alwaies vnderstand iudgemente: which is not worth the answering: for albeit priuate old men may lacke wit, yet Christes old spouse, which is the Church, can not.
               
                  Secondly he alleageth out of Philip of Mornay,
                     Phillippe of Mornay translated by feild
                   that the Church is compared to a shippe on the sea, to a citie, and to a mans body: all which decay by old age and néede reparation, and therefore the Church in like manner. To which I answere, that, by as good consequente I mighte argue,
                     Io. 15. Apoc. 5.
                   Christ is compared to a vyne and therfore néeded to be lopte: also to a Lion, and therfore néeded to be fedd with raw flesh, which is absurde. For similitudes must not be lyke in al things: especiallye, in the matter whereof we talke, where comparison is made in perfections, and not in defectes. For the Church is compared to a shippe on the sea,
                     Math. 8.15.
                   in that as a shippe is tossed by many waues and yet not drowned: soe the Church by many persecutiōs, & is not ouerwhelmed. Also to a citie and humane body, for that, as they haue their members

one aboue another, and one rulinge the other by good lawes:
                     1. Cor. 12 Ephes. 4.
                   soe she hath her deuision of fūctions as S. Paul expoundeth.
               
                  Thirdly he obiecteth, that Caine was elder then Abel, Ismaell then Isaac, the Iewes law, then Christes law, and yet antiquitie made them not the better. I answere: that we hold not, al old things to be the better: for soe old bootes were better then new: but in al alterations of religion amongest Christians, the elder religion is absolutely the better, for that as I noted before,
                     Math. 13
                           •
                        
                     
                   the good corne was first sowē by Christ, and after the cockle cast in by the deuil.
               
                  Fourthly, he obiecteth the east Churches of Gréekes, Armenians, and Ethiopians, which are fallen into errours, and yet are as aunciente as the Church of Rome. To which I answere, that lettinge passe the comparison of their antiquitie, I saye their errours are not soe auncient, but that we know when they beganne and vppon what occation, and were controwled euen at the beginning which is sufficient for our purpose. For our aduersaries can neuer shew the lyke

of the Romane religion.
               
                  Lastly he bringeth in certaine Fathers, as Ignatius, Tertulliā and Cyprian, inueihing agaynst noughtie wicked customes. But what maketh this against vs
                     •
                   We defend not noughtie customes: nor is our questiō of such matters: but note Iohn Nicols discretion in this place, in citing S. Cipriā, in his second booke and third epistle, wher he inueigheth against certaine lewde priestes, which vppon an euil custome,
                     Wyne and water in the sacrifice.
                   did vse to consecrate & sacrifice wyne onelye in the chalice, and not wine and water together, as Christ taught them, and the Church vsed, as he sayeth: and is this against vs, or against our aduersaries
                     •
                  
               
               
                  Agaynst the thyrd marke which is succession,
                     Nicols obiections agaynste succession. Fol. 27.
                   Nicols bringeth more stoare of obiections, all or the most parte out of Phillippe of Mornay his booke, which booke (as I heare) bereth some swaye amongest simple men in Englande, but how vndeseruedly may appeare partely by his argumentes here answered and before: which in déede are the substance of that vayne treatise. First therefore Nicols obiecteth, that, vppon the chayre

                   Caluin did, and not by ordinarie vocati
                     •
                  on and succession: and for this cause, eue
                     •
                  ry word, hath his proper emphasis. For he sayeth:
                     Eiseleusontai 
                           •
                        is hymas
                   
                  They shall enter in vpon you, which importeth intrusion and not succession or orderlye vocation. He sayeth: not sparinge the flocke, and not, their flocke: to signifie, that they were not their ordinarie pastours by succession

nor the people their flocke. He sayeth
                     •
                   not: there shal spring vppe, which is proper to successiō: but, there shal arise vpp, or lifte vp them selues to dignitie, without vocation,
                     Anastesontai.
                   certayne men speakinge peruerse thinges, to draw away disciples after them: which also is added to signifie, that these men, had not disciples of their owne, because they were noe pastours. And this you sée, that albeit we grau
                     •
                  t, that a man which came lawfully to a place by successiō, may afterward fall away and become an hereticke: yet heresie cometh not by succession, as S. Paul signifieth in this place, and therefore straunge is their follie and impudencie, which blushe not to bringe this place for proofe of the contrarie.
               
                  Thirdly, Nicolls raungeth further from the purpose, alleaging S. Ierome his sayinge: That they are not alwaies Saintes children, which possesse the place of Saintes. As though we did holde that they were: and that the Turke were a Sainte, for possessinge the Saintes places in Hierusalem. This is a straunge kinde of argumente against succession. But he addeth against the Pope without

citing any place, that: The Pope is heir
                        •
                      of S. Peters goodnes. And that: He receaueth holynes from his chayre &c. To which I answere, that the Canons doe commaunde e

                  It is not sayed here, that they (the pastors) are holy, but that they are presumed as holy, vntill the contrary be manifest.
               
               
                  Fourthly, Nicols obiecteth the e
                     •
                  ample of the Iewes, whoe refused Christ & his doctrine, and denied his préesthood, for that he came not to th

                  m by succession, addinge, that if we had bene then aliue, we would haue reiected him also for the like caus
                     •
                  , as we doe now Caluin & Luther and other Ghospellers, with much other like tedious trashe. To al which I

answere, yt this argumēt maketh gretly against his owne side, as ye most of yt did, which he obiected against vs before. For ye Iews sinn was not, in refusing Christ for lacke of successiō: for they might wel haue denied his ordinarie vocation for y• want, séeinge they had an expresse lawe from God,
                     Nu. 1.4.8.
                   yt none should be préest, but of the Tribe of Leuie, wherof Christ was not, but of Iuda. But ye Iews sinn was, in reiecting Christs extraordinary vocatiō, which was prophecied to thē by Moises before, yt it should be as his was,
                     Deut. 18.
                   and which Christ did now proue by many euident supernatural miracles, and yet they would not receue him. This Christ him selfe testifieth, sayinge:
                     Ioh. 15.
                   
                  If I had not done the works among them, which noe other man hath done: they had no sinne. And againe:
                     Ioh. 14.
                   
                  Beleeue me for my workes sake. And againe: If I doe not the works of my father, (yt is supernatural works) beleeue me not: but if I doe them, then if you wil not beleue me, beleue my works.
                  
                     Ioh. 10.
                   Againe:
                     Luc. 7.
                   when Iohn Baptist did send to Christ, to know whether he was ye true Messias or noe: he wrought miracles only in their sight, and bidd them tell Iohn Baptist, what they had séene and harde,

signifying that, that was a sufficient testimonye,
                     Extraordinari vocation not to be admitted without miracles.
                   and without that he were not to be beléeued. The like he hathe shewed in all those that euer he sente besides him selfe, to reforme or instructe the people, by extraordinarie vocation without succession: as in Moyses, Aron, and all the Prophetes, the Apostels also, and diuers other after them, as Anthonie, Hillarion, Benedict, Dominicke, Francis, and others, which being noe pastors by successiō, wer sent extraordinarily for the help of the Church, but their vocatiō was declared, by euident miracles. And soe also must 
                     •
                  ur new pastors and prelates shew their extraordinarie vocation by euident miracles, séeing they can not plead ordinare succession, or Canonical ordination, excepte they will challenge more vnto them selues, then the very sonne of God, whoe required not to be admitted, (as I haue shewed) but only vppon that testimonye, concurringe together with the Scriptures which spake of him.
               
                  Nether is that drye shifte of Philipe of Mornay, or rather childishe euasion, to be admitted, where he saythe, that it is a sufficient miracle for the protestantes,

that one poore friar Luther hath made so great an alteration in the world,
                     A straung miracle whereby the protestāts proue their vocation.
                   in soe few yeares: and so many thowsand men haue forsakē their old religion vpon the onely blaste of his mouth. This I say is very ridiculous, and worthy of such a deuine as he was. For by this argument, Arrius, Donatus, Manicheus, Pelagius, & aboue al other, Mahomet, wrought verye greate miracles, and proued their vocations substantiallye, because they drew from the trueth, so many thowsand men to followe their errours. Nay, rather it is an euident argument that Luther was a wicked deceauer, preaching plausible doctrine to itching eares.

                   ruling them by right of succession, as Luther did, though those former pastours wer neuer so wicked

in life. Nay, more, Christ himselfe which came to plant a new law, and new pastours also, and to remoue from there places the scribes and pharises, yet for the litle time they had to endure, (which was vntil after the new testament was sealed with his bloode,
                     Math. 8. Marc. 1. Luc. 5.
                  ) he taught obedience to the saide Pharasies, as maye appeare by sending the leapers vnto them, and by charginge all men to doe as they commaunded.
                     Math. 23.
                   And this is greatly to be noted as a very plaine detection of our aduersaries.
               
                  Fifthely, Nicols obiectethe, that the Iewes bragged of succession from their father Abraham, and yet Christ saith they were of the deuill: soe diuers that came to their bishoprickes by succession,

                     •
                  us. But all this (as the other) is quite from the matter. For we graunte (as I saide before) that those which succéede in good mens places, may alter and become wicked, and playe also the heretiques or apostatas. But that religion which hath come downe by succession from the beginning, as ours hath done, can not be false: nor that religion which

raiseth it selfe, against the same without succession, and the other markes before recited, (as al heresies haue done) cannot be true.
               
                  Lastly, he obiecteth that we, by this succession of the sea of Rome, doe tye our religion to one place and prouince. Which is not so, but it is his, & his felowes gross error in mistakinge vs. For albeit we hould the Bishop of Rome, as successor of S. Péeter, to be the only supreme pastor of al christianitie: yet is it not necessarie, that he shoulde be in Rome, or any way tyed vnto that citie, but i

                         Howlet.
                   Wherfore we doe not make oure Catholique religion locall or of one prouince, as besides Ihon Nicols,

the peart master of penbrooke Haull very vndocterly affirmeth.
               
                  I might heere add a pleasant obiection of Ihon Nicols, which he vrgeth in great earnest against succession, & that is, yt the Turke at this daye possesseth fower Patriarkcal sées by succession, and that Antichrist in the ende of the world, shal cō
                  
                     •
                   to his tirannicall authoritie, by succession. & cet. Which is as true, as that his religion commeth from Christ and his Apostles by succession. What righte the Turke hathe to the fower Patriarchall sées, & Antechrist to the rule of the world by succession, the same hath his religion and her prelates, to the gouernmente of Christian people.
               
                  And thus I haue aunswered all that they obiect against the first thrée markes of the true church. For against yt fowerth which is vnitie, they say nothing, nor can they bring any excuse of their owne discord, but only that we haue sectes among vs also, as Benedictins:
                     Varietie of religious orders noe sectes in ye Cotholique Church.
                   Dominicans, Franciscans, & other orders of religion. Which is as absurd an illation, as: you haue in your bodye fingers, toes, eares & like partes, & therfore you haue distincte

bodyes, and are a monster. For as fingers, toes, and eares, are not bodies, or deuisions of one bodye, but partes and ornamentes of the same, because they receaue all life, norishment, & spirite from one soule: soe diuers orders of religious men and women not differing in faithe, but in manner of life in the Catholique Church, are partes and ornamētes of the same church, according to the propheci of her before made: The Queen stood at thy right hand in golden apparel,
                        Psal. 45.
                      enuironed with varieties. These varieties, are the varieties of states, degrées, professions, & orders in the Catholique Church, which al, agréeing in one fountaine of faith, and taking norishment, life, and spirite, from that vnitie of faithe, as diuers members from one soule: do not impaire, but bewtifie the vnitie of that body, which is the Catholique church, and therfore are not to be called sectes, as the Lutherans, Caluinistes, and Puritanes are, which differ in matter of beléefe and doctrine. For all that hath béene saide therfore, or euer can be heerafter, I doe not sée, why our

For aboute miracles and reuelations he laboureth much, to proue that false miracles and reuelations are not to be credited, which we graunt vnto him without proofe. And touchinge Purgatorie, and prayer for the dead, and inuocation of Saintes, he affirmeth them to be late inuentions of Popes and papists, wheras his owne companions,

In oppugninge Images, he bringeth a great heape of quotatiōs against idols, & thinketh yt sufficiēt. Against the Pope he disputeth not, but raileth, & cōncludeth in the end with an

impudent lye out of Phillip of Mornay, saying: That the Pope hath caused men to dispute, that he is not simply a man, but a partaker of the diuine nature with Christ.
                  
                     A malitious lye againste ye Pope.
                   Sée the shamelesse foreheade I praye you, of men blinded with malice. The very wordes of the decretall alleaged, are these: talking of seperating of a Bishoppe from a certaine Bishoppricke which he held vnlawfully. Not man, but God doth seperate, whom the Bishop of Rome (vicegerent in earth,
                  
                     Prope Innocē
                        tius de transl. cap. quanto.
                   
                  not simply of a mā, but of him which is also true God) doth seperate, rather by Godes authoritie then mans, vppon consideration ether of the necessitie or vtilitie of Churches.
               
               
                  Thyrdly, he hath a propertie ether of ignorance or malice, to tyre his answerer by cyting of things which are not to be found, albeit they be such for the most parte, as we would graunt without citing. As for example he alleageth S. Austen li. 2. ca. 20. de consens. euang. against séeking of Christ in paynted walles: but noe such thinge is founde there, nor yet occasion of anye lyke matter. He alleageth S. Chrisostome hom. 30. in Math. repeting the Pharisées words to Christ:

which, albeit it toucheth not the matter: yet noe such thinge is to be séene there. He citeth William Nubridge li. 2. ca. 15. & 25. for S. Thomas of Canterburie his wordes to the Bishoppe of Menze against Rome:
                     A newe kind

                        s.
                   but noe such matter appeareth in that place, nor any mention of the Bishop of menze. He citeth Allen Cope dial. 1. pag. 18. for false miracles before Images in our Churches: but read the place, and you shal sée there noe lyke argument handled. He alleageth S. Basil mistrusting his owne workes in psa. 32. which although it be not against vs: yet must I note, that noe such thinge is there to be séene. I could geue dyuers other examples, but this is sufficient: to which do you add, that he nameth almost twentie authores without citinge any place: and many things without naming any author. As for example, where he vrgeth his fellow prisoners, the priestes that came from Rome, with this greate authoritie in latine, and after englished. One sayethe: that whiles the Romishe preistes, endeuour as much as they can to preach thinges, in shewe, agreeable to health of soules, then, teach they noe few

things, tending to perpetuall distruction of soules.
               
               
                  This one, that sayeth this, is ether Iohn Nicols onely, or els some other of lesse credite then himselfe, if it be possible to finde a creature of lesse credite. And was not this a forcible texte trow you, to be recited in latine, out of the pulpet, and to be translated in english, and to be vrged in that audiēce, for the stirring of hatred againste those learned and vertuous priestes?
               
                  Fowrthly, it is a world to sée, what his demeanour is in the places rightlye alleaged:
                     Nicols conclusio

                        s.
                   for first, of nothing he wil inferr any thing: and commonly, his consequēt hath noe coherence or affinitie with his antecedēt. I haue geuen some examples before: as, because Iobe sayeth, that olde men vnderstand not alwayes iudgemēt, therefore antiquitie is no good marke of the true Church. Because Christ sayed to his desciples little flocke, therefore the lesser congregations amongeste Christians haue alwaies the better fayth in religion. I coulde shew you hundredes of these illations through out his booke. Secondly, if his wit serue him not to draw

some false consequente from the place, then audacitie supplieth to corrupt it by translation: whereof, besides that which hath bene noted before, I will bréeflye shew one example here, in stéed of many which I omit. He citeth a place out of S. Austen, against prayer to Saints: where he sayeth his words are these, talking of Saintes departed:
                     Aug. lib. de spiritu & anima ca. 29.
                   
                  Such is their care for the liuinge, that they know not what we doe: euen as our care is for the dead, that we know not what they doe. By which words, Nicols would haue men thincke that S. Austē disalowed praier to saints which is contrary to Fulks opiniō,
                     In his booke against Purgatory pag. 315. 316.317.
                   who confesseth Austē to haue defēded this superstition, as he termeth it, & rayleth on him for it: but we shal easely recōcile the matter: for S. Austen is not contrarie to him selfe, though he be cōtrary to Fulke and Nicolls.
               
                  The occasiō of S. Austēs words was this, he had saied immediatly before, that Saints in heauē did not vnderstād or sée our state here of their owne power, or absolutelye of them selues, but by other meanes which he putteth downe a

                  t
                     •
                  r: yet, lest vpon this his sayinge some man might take occasiō to dout whether they had any care of vs,

or were to be prayed vnto or no: he preuenteth the matter thus.
                     Compare this with Nicols translation.
                   
                  Ita tamen ect eis cura de viuis, quanquā quid agant omnino nesciant, quemadmodū cura est nobis de mortuis, quamuis quid agant vtique nesciamus. nesciunt quidem mortui quid hic agatur: sed dum hic agitur, postea audire possunt ab eis, qui hinc moriendo ad eos pergunt &c. ab angelis qui hic nobis presto sunt &c. spiritu etiam dei reuelante &c. Which is truly translated thus. Albeit (the saintes departed) know not at all what the liuinge doe: yet haue they care of them in such sort, as we haue care of the dead, albeit wee knowe not what they doe. The dead knowe not in deede what is donne heere: but yet, whē it is donne heere they maye heare it after,

                   whoe, albeit at other times, beinge prest, doe confesse al the ould Fathers to be of our side, and to haue erred with vs, as Fulke dothe of S. Ambrose, Austen, Tertulian, Origen, Chrisostōe, Gregorie, & Beade, by name, with most

reprochful and contemptuous wordes against them for the same: yet, when any thing passeth from thē, to the simple people, they are so gredy to colour it, with sōe credit of the ould Fathers assent,

                   as they wil rather venture to corrupt some place or other, then to lack some litle shewe of antiquitie. So they are not ashamed, holding the heresie of Uigilantius, about inuocation of Saintes: to cite S. Ierome in defence of it, whoe wrot aganist Uigilātius for holding the same. Soe, houlding the heresies of Aerius, about prayer for the dead, and of Iouinian aboute fasting, virginitie, and mariage of Uotaries: they blushe not to cite, Epiphanius, Austen, and Ierom, whoe are open enemies to them for the saide heresies.
               
                  But yet Iohn Nicols hath one gift-more, which is also an vsual talent amō
                  gest his compagnions: & that is, to enter fréely vpon a place, manifestly & directly against him selfe. And perforce to rente therhence some litle doutful spéech or oother, sounding towardes his purpose, & to set it forth for the authores own meaning, without all scruple of conscience in the world: as though our writinge in

cōtrouersies were iugling, only to deceue the reader and not to instruct him for his saluation. Good Lord into what desperat times are we come? this cannot be but obstinat wilfulnes, and full, determinat, resolute malice: but let vs sée an example of this. I may not stand to recite much, for that I hasten, and sumwhat maye be gathered by that whiche hath béene saide before: but yet one place I can not let passe, wherby you maye easely iudge of the reste.

                  des on holy S. Ambrose, and by violence to borow some argument from him: and finding him in déed very pore for that purpose, was faine to be contente with two doutful lynes, which might be wrested to his opinion, amongest more then two hū
                  dred, plaine, and euidently against him. The wordes aledged by Nicols are thes,

                  As thow hast receaued the similitude of his deathe, soe doest thou drinke the similitude of his precious bloode. By whiche wordes simple people muste beléeue, that S. Ambrose heald not the real presence

Christ his very body and bloode in the sacrament, but only the similitude forsooth. Which, how true it is, and what consciences these men haue which alleage thes thinges for deceauing the people, shal appeare by the rest of S. Ambrose his wordes in the same place, whiche are these. First making the question.
               
                  Thou perhappes wilte say, (of the sacrament) it is my vsual bread.
                  
                     Amb. li. 4. de sacr. ca. 4.
                   To which he answereth. This bread is bread, before the Sacramental wordes: but after the cō
                     secratiō is added vnto it, of bread, is made the fleshe of Christ. This therfore let vs proue: how can bread become the bodye of Christ? by Consecration. The consecration, by wbat wordes, and by whose wordes, is it made? By the wordes of our Lord Iesus: the speech of Christ maketh this sacrament. But what spech of Christ? that forsooth, wherby, al things wer made. God gaue his commandement, & the firmament was made: God gaue his commandement, & the earth was made:
                  
                     How bread b
                           •
                         cummeth the flesh of Christ
                   
                  God gaue his cōmandement, and the seas were made: God gaue his cōmandement, & all creaturs wer made. Seest thou thē, how powerful the speech of Christ is? why thē, if the speech of Christ had so much force as to make things be, that wer not befor: how

how much more powerfull shal it be, to make those things bee, that were before, and to be chaunged into other? The firmamente was not: The sea was not: the earth was not: but heare him speake:
                  
                     Psal. 148.
                   
                  He spake the word and they were made: He commaunded, and they were created. Therefore now to answere thee: (I say) It was not the body of Christ before consecration: but after consecratiō, I tell thee, that now it is the body of Christ. He hath spoken the worde, and it is made (his bodye:) he hath commaūded, and it is created. Thus farre are S. Ambrose his owne wordes.
               
                  After this, he vseth many examples to proue the same, especially fower. The firste, that Christ against all reason and nature, was borne of a woman without hurte of her virginitie. The second that Christ against natural reason, made the redde sea deuide it selfe, at the touch onely of Moyses rod. The thyrd, that Christ with putting a péece of woode into a bitter well, chaunged the nature of it. The fourthe,
                     4. Reg. 6.
                   that Christe caused Elizeus to make iron to swyme vpon the water agaynst his owne nature. Of al which examples, he inferreth that we ought not

to doubte of this miracle in the Sacrament. For thus he sayeth: Of all these thinges thow seest, what the heuenlye speach (of Christ) is able 
                        •
                     o worke: soe that, thow hast learned now, that of bred is made the body of Christ:
                  
                     water & wine in the chalice.
                   
                  & that wine and water is putt into the chalice, but by the consecration of God his word, it is made bludde. And after this, follow imm
                     •
                  diatelye the wordes alleaged by Nicols, and they followe by way of obiection, as from one which sayeth, that he séeeth not the forme of bloode, but of wyne. For these are the words: But parhappes thow wilte saye, I see not the foorme of blood: to which he answereth.
                     The forme of wine hath the similitude of bloode in the Sacrament.
                   
                  But yet it hath the similitude: for as thow hast receaued the similitude of death, soe also doest thow drinck the similitude of precio
                        •
                     s blood, to the end that their should be noe horrour of raw blood, and yet it may worke the price of redēptiō. Thow hast learned therefore, that, that which thow receaueste is the bodye of Christe. Thus farre S. Ambrose.
               
                  In which words he yeldeth a reason, why (though in the Sacrament be true bloode) there doth remayne the forme of

wine: and the reason is, (as he sayth) for the auoyding of horror, which men wold haue conceaued if they should drinke his bloode in natural forme. Wherfore, séeing the forme of wine, hath the similitude of blood, it was apointed that, that shape or forme should remaine stil. And so, albeit in the sacrament we drinke very bloode, yet in externall forme we drinke but the similitud of blood: for auoiding of horror, euen as in baptisme we receaue but a fimilitud of death,
                     Rom. 6. Colos. 2.
                   by putting water vppon vs, albeit our soule doth dye in very déede, from the state and common wealth of the diuel, sinn, and bondage wherin it liued before as a subiecte. This reasone of the formes of wine and bread, remaining after consecration in the very body and blood of Christe, S. Ambrose in diuers other places expoundeth diligently, as namely, after in the same worke.

                  soe is it true fleshe which we receaue, according to his sayeinge. And his true blood is our drinke. But perhapes thou wilt say, as some times

his desciples saide, when they hearde him say, Except ye eate my fleshe. &c.
                  
                     Ioh. 6.
                   
                  Howe are thes things true? I see the similitud, but not the verytie of blood. First I haue toulde thee, howe Christe his speeche, is able to change and conuert the kindes of nature. Secondly when Christ his desciples could not beare his speeche but departed, hearinge that he would geue his flesh to eate, and his blood to drinke, &c. Least more should saye the same, because of the horror of rawe bloode, &c. therfore thou doest, receaue this sacramente in

                     imilytude, &cet.
               
               
                  Now I appeale to the consciences of all Christians which read controuersies for desire of truth, and not of contention, whether it be likely, that Nicols coulde picke out thos two lines amongest al the rest in S. Ambrose and not to sée or read the other: especially, that long discourse which followe the imediatly
                     •
                   vppon the same matter in the chapter followinge? where hauing handled the verye wordes of institution of this sacrament, both out of the gospel & also of Paul, he addeth:
                     Ambr. li. 4. de sacr. ca. 5
                   
                  Vide singula. &c. Consider al: before consecration it is bread, but after the wordes of Christ ended, it is Christ his bodye. So

Soe, before the wordes of Christ, the chalice is full of wyne and water, but when Christ his wordes haue wrought their effect, there is made that blood which redemed the people. Is it possible (I say) that Nicols and his felowes did not sée th
                     •
                  se thinges in Ambrose? or if they did, what graceles impudencie is this, to make a shew as though S. Ambrose made for thē whom they saw so euedently, so abundātly, & soe earnestly against them? These thinges and the like, as I sayde before, haue, discoraged me from following Ihō Nicols any further in thes cōtrouersies. wherfore I wil leaue him héere, only adding two or thrée words to a few places of Fathers, which maye séeme to the vnlearned, to make some what against vs. About the Supremacie of the Bishop of Rome he aleageth one Nilius,
                     Of the Supremacie.
                   
                  de primatu Ponti Roma. who should say, that the bishop of Rome hath no more authoritie ouer other Patriarches, then they ouer him. But I finde not this authore, and I think he erreth, for Hanmer, out of whōe he tooke the most part of this matter, alegeth him by the name of Nilus, and sumwhat other wise in wordes then Nicols

reporteth. But nether finde I any suche worke vnder the name of Nilus. For of that name I know but two of any antiquitie, & they both martirs: the one mentioned in Eusebius li. 8. ca. 22.
                  
                     This Nilus workes the 2. Nicen coūcell affirmeth to be corrupted in that time by heretiques
                  . the other in Nicephorus li. 14. ca. 14. nether which, haue any such worke reported. Wherfor when we shal haue better intelligence of the authore, our answere shall be more particuler.
               
                  Secondly he allegeth confusely out of Ciprian two places together as one text which are in diuers bokes and in diuers matters.
                     Lib. de sim. Prel.
                   But the last is only of any importance (for the first is against him selfe directly) which last, is 
                     •
                  aken out of the bishopes sentences gathered in the prouincial Coūcel at Carthage, wher S. Cipriā saith,

                           •

                  That noe bishop in that Councell made him selfe bishop of bishopes, or did by tirannical feare compel others to his opiniō, but that it was lawful for euery bishope there, to think and speake what he wold. Which he saith, 
                     •
                  or yt the Nouatiōs had geuen out the contrarye of him, that is, that he compelled men to his opinion & played the tirā ouer other, which was false: but yet that he denyed not by this ye
                  
Bishop of Rome to be Primate, and to haue authoritie ouer them all, it appeareth both by that he sente all their determinations in this Councel, to be admitted, or reiected, by Stephanus, Bishop of Rome: as S. Ierome witnesseth. And Stephanus vsed his authoritie:
                     Iero dial. cont. Lncif.
                   For he condemned most worthily this Councel as S. Austen affirmeth. The same also, appeareth by that,
                     Aug. li. 3.6. 7. de Bapti.
                   that Felicissimus the Nouatiā with his companions went to Rome, to complayne to Cornelius the Bishoppe, against Cyprian, to haue him deposed.
                     Cy. li. 1. ep 3 ad Cornel.
                   And that the Bishop of Rome, as generall pastour of all, mighte vppon causes depose any Bishoppe of an other countrie: it appeareth by Cyprian him selfe, whoe desireth Stephanus Bishopp of Rome, to depose by his letters, one Martianus a Nouatian,

                  her in his roome. And for the libertie here mentioned by Ciprian, for Bishops to say and thincke what they list in matters of controuersie:
                     Aug. li. 3 de Bap. ca. 3.
                   S. Austen expoundeth it, not to be vnderstoode generally in al matters, but in controuersies not yet discussed.
               
                  
                  By this also is answered, that which followeth in Nicols, out of Ciprā without citing the place. That Cypriā should complaine of some lewde mens runninge to Rome against him: which is true. For he complaineth to Cornelius the Pope, of Felicissimus & Fortunatus Nouatiās yt without iust cause, came to complaine of him, to ye saied Cornelius,
                     Cy. li. 1. ep. 3 ad Corneli.
                   & he cōmē
                  deth Cornelius for not acceptinge their accusatiōs, nor yet the letters which they brought against him. By which act, as also in al ye epistle, he cōfirmeth most plainly ye Primacie of Rome. Wherfore, al ye which follweth in Nicols is most impudently inserted of him selfe, to wit: That Cypriā complained of prophane men, & schismaticks, which withdrew thē selues to the Bishoppe of Rome, wickedly perswading them selues, that the Bishops of Africa had lesse power, thē the Bishop of Rome. But S. Cipriā hath no such thing.
               
                  The laste yt he citeth about this matter out of S. Chrisostome:
                     Chri. ho. 83. in Math. 
                           •

Although it maye be trewlye spoken of him, which shal couetouslye and ambitiously contend to be Primate, hauing no right to it: yet I finde noe such thinge in the place alleaged, nor in any other place that this quotation might lead me vnto: for the 83. homelie is not vppon the 23. chapter of Mathewe, but vppon the 26. where noe such thinge is
                     •
                   but all against them, of the Sacrifice of the Euchariste. Secondly, vpon the 23. chapter, there are the 73.74. and 75. homelies, wherein also noe such thing is found. Finally, that Chrisostome acknoweledged the supremacie of the Bishop of Rome,
                     Chris. ep. 1. ad Innocē.
                   it may appeare playnly by his epistle to Innocentius the Pope: by whom he desireth to be restored againe to his Patriarchship, (being vniustly deposed) and that his deposers might be punnished by him. And that the saied Innocētius practized this authoritie, appeareth by that he excommunicated from Rome,

                  We nether worship nor wish for crosses: you that consecrate woodden godds, doe adore in deede wooden crosses as partes of your goddes, In which words (to let passe Nicolls corrupt translation almost in euerie lyne,) Arnobius onely telleth the Gentiles, that Christiās nether worshipped, nor wished for crosses in that sense, as they obiected, to witt, to make them Goddes: for soe the Gentiles (being reproued by Christians of their idolatrie) replied, that the Christians were Staurolatrae,

                   yt is, idolatours to crosses, as much as the Gentiles weare to other thinges: which Arnobius denieth. And yet, hereby it appeareth that Christians vsed some honour and reuerence to crosses in thos daies, or els ye Gētiles would neuer haue obi

                  After this, he obiecteth two places of Epiphanius against Images: The firste is without quotation: but yet it is found

in the second Councell of Nice,
                     Sy. 7. Act. 6
                   obiected by heretiques then, as it is nowe, and ther it is answered by another Epiphanius, in the name of the Councell, and proued by many argumentes to be none of Epiphanius his wordes, but foysted in by the wicked Iconomachians. The other place also,
                     Epip. ep. ad Ioā. Hieros.
                   which is againste the hanginge vppe of mens pictures in the Church, is added by heretiques, to a certayne epistle of Epiphanius, and is parhaps that second place, which the Councel affermed to be inserted,
                     Act. 6.
                   (for it speaketh of two) but whether it be that or noe, it is euident, that it is added by heretiques as the other before was: both for that, the epistle of Epiphanius was perfectlye ended before these wordes ensewe:
                     Hier. ep. ad Pāmac. cōt. Ioā. Hiero.
                   And S. Ierome to Pammachius reciteth almoste all this epistle of Epiphanius translated by him, and yet maketh noe mention of these wordes. And it is reported in the seuenthe generall Councel, how that the schollers of Epiphanius after his death, builded a church in his honour,
                     Synod 7.

                  Before I enter to speake of his oration & sermon, I will bréefely ronne ouer an epistle of his, to the Marchant venturers, containing a narration of his own aduentures, with denyal of certaine informations geuen of him in writing by some man, belike, that knew his behaueour and detested his doinges. Where, albeit he séemeth to disaduouche some litle pointes reported of him by me before, yet the matter is not so reiected: for that there are witnesses of his owne spéeche here in, from which only we receaued intelligence of thes thinges: & by denying yt which foloweth, of his voluntarie repaire to the Roman Inquisitiō,

                   a thing so euedently knowen to the world: he sheweth of what veritie his other denials are. He was before his comming to Rome, recō
                  ciled to the Romane church as he saithe:

and he had dwelt with a bishope the Popes Protonotorie, a good space: what thē had the Inquisitours to doe with him now, who medle with none after reconciliation, although they had bin ministers and preachers of herestes before: as may appeare by diuers English ministers retourned to the faith, of later yeares. How could also the Popes Protonotorie, geue Nicols entertainment, or kéepe him in his seruice so long space, if he had not séen him free from ye Inquisition? but Nicols strugleth the more in this point, to couer therby that manifest false lye, which hee hath put in the very title of his booke, Aboute the payne of deathe assigned to him, if he first made not that sermon and oration. By which inuention, he pretendeth two thinges: the one to excuse his own abusing the protestantes in Rome, as done vppon feare: the other to bringe the Pope into opinion of crueltie, and therby to deminish in her Maiestie compassion towardes afflicted Catholiques in Englande. But all men, thoughe of verye meane vnderstandinge, knowe, that paynes of death are non proposed to them which anye waye yeald, to forsake

                  fesseth him selfe recōciled before, & in fauourable credite with the Popes Protonotorie. Wherfore, take this amonge the rest, as a malitious and wicked machauelian lye.

For some hee graunteth, albeit with qualifications: as that he was ridiculous to the colledge in his excercises: but (he saithe) it was the poynte of an oratour to moue laughture. Also that he preached on a stoole to his felowes: but yet not often (as he saith) but only being merily disposed

                   not to his owne inhabilitie, but to the malice of one Ferdinando his Prefect in studies, euel affectioned to welshe men, as he reporteth: but it hathe noe probabilitie of truth, that ether he, being an Italian & a good man, had suche partial affection in our diuersitie of countries: or if he had, that he woulde vse it in suche a matter, as this is. But yet to make this more credible, or rather more ridiculous, he

vaunteth him selfe ouer all the studentes in the Colledge or Seminarie, affirmming:

Adding also to diuers of them certaine foolishe nicknames according to his small discretion, as though he had béen preaching vnder a maye pole, and not writing a booke to presente vnto a Princesse. But the latine epistle before the sayde booke vnto her Maiestie, as also the other, writen to his Patron before, well shewethe vs the skill of Iohn Nicols in the latyne, and disclosethe the mans intollerable vanitye, in bragging of that, wherin hee knowethe nothing.

Besids this, he calleth him a théefe: for causinge some Abbotes and Priors in Italie, to disburse some monie towardes the maintenance of the English Seminaries in Rome & Rhemes: as though this had bene théeuerie, if he had done it, as he did not: or as thoughe the Englishe Seminaries did presse the Pope more, then soe manye other as I haue named before, maintained by him with greater charge.

               A new information from Rome of I. Nicols.
               
                  As I had finished & deliuered this treatise to y• print, ther came vnto me an honest, discréet & learned gētlemā frō Rome who affirmed yt vpon ye sight of I. Nicols booke ther, & other informatiōs of his doinges in England,

serche was made for his oration and sermon of ten shéetes of paper, presented in Rome before the Pope and regestred (as he saith) in thrée paper volumes in the office of Inquisition. The matter was easely found out, and a coppie taken word for word by publique Notaries: the cō
                  mon scale also of the office, was added vnto it, and (as this man remembreth) the most of all the chéefe officers names subscribed: but yet for some other further approbation (as I thinke) the thing is not hetherto sent from thence, or at least not yet come vnto my handes. Wherfore the Printer being not able to staye, nor I certaine how soone it will come, I iudg it not a misse, to geue the reader some general intelligence of the matter (vntil the thinge it selfe maye be published in print) vppon the reporte of this discréet gentleman, whoe bothe sawe it and read it, and remembreth well the principal contentes therof.
               
                  First therfore he reporteth, that Iohn Nicols made nether oration nor sermon in Rome, nor that anye suche thinge is there regestred or remembred. But only his recantation is ther to be séen, of lesse

then a shéete of paper in writen hand,
                     Nicols oration & sermon of ten sheetes become an abiuration of lesse then one sheete.
                   together with a longe preface, which preface is an ordinarie thing of that courte, containing the causes of his repentance and voluntarie offering him selfe thither and the like. After this Ihon Nicols commeth to put down his owne faultes committed before in England, bothe in doctrine and life. And for doctrine, the reporter saith, he hath numbred vp all the particuler heresies whiche euer he héelde or taught, and this, with very significante wordes: as that he taught the detestable heresie of Luther, against prayer for the dead: the blasphemus heresie of Caluine against Christes real presence in the sacrament, or the like. Aboute lyfe, the reporter remembreth not much in particuler, but only that he saieth there. Ego possedi duo benefici
                        •
                      vnum simoniace & alterum gratis. That is. 
                     He reported notwithstandinge afterwarde that he had them both by Simonie.
                   
                  I possessed two benifices, one by simonie, the other freelye. Hauing declared his faultes, he taketh in hand the detestation of them: especially, of those in doctrine. And there (as the reporter sayeth) he besturreth him selfe in deed: for he vseth such vehemencie of wordes, as recantation, renunciation, abnegation,

detestation, abiuration, an
                     •
                   protestation, as he neuer heard nor could imagin the like, with thundering amplifications of condemning those heresies with their authores and folowers, to th

                   bottomeles pit of hell.
               
                  Last of all, ensew his penance, enioyned him for his faultes confessed, which he then promised to performe, soe farre, as in him laye: what they were in perticuler, the reporter remembreth not, but onlye in general, that they were of fasting and prayeing and other good exercises, wherof nowe I thinke Ihon Nicols taketh litle care. But yet one thing more there is, not to be omitted, which the reporter merilye toulde me, of the beginning of Ihon Nicols abiuration, whiche was thus. Ego Iohannes Nicolaus filius alterius Iohannis &c. I, Iohn Nicols sonne of an other Iohn: Wherby the Romans learned, what was latine for Iohn ap Iohn.
               
            
            
               An example of Iohn Nicols talent in raylinge at bothe sides.
               
                  THAT the pages folowinge shoulde not be emptie, and for the readers better

instruction in Iohn Nicols good qualities I thought it not a misse to put downe an example or proofe of his habilitie, or rather facilitie, in speakinge yuel of bothe partes as his occations haue serued hertofore, or maye here after. That which I will put downe, shalbe his owne wordes taken out of his laste booke, that is, out of his forged oration and sermon, which oration and sermon séeinge he neuer made in Rome, as I haue proued before: it is euident that he hathe diuised them in England for his excercises, Pro & Con, to geat some admiration & spéech of him therby, without disfauoure. And therfore he hathe tempered his talke soe, as he hathe spoken some what worse of Catholiques then of protestantes, and yet bad ynough of them bothe.
