            A
SHORT RElation
made by the
Lord De-La-Warre, to the Lords
and others of the Counsell of Virginea,
touching his vnexpected returne home, and afterwards
deliuered to the generall Assembly
of the said Company, at a Court holden
the twenty fiue of Iune,
1611.
            Published by authority of
the said Counsell.
            
               My Lords, &c.
            
            
               BEing now by accident returned
from my Charge at Virginea, contrary
either to my owne desire, or

other mens expectations, who spare not
to censure me, in point of duty, and to discourse
and question the reason, though
they apprehend not the true cause of my
returne, I am forced, (out of willingnesse
to satisfie euery man) to deliuer vnto your
Lordships, and the rest of this Assembly,
briefely, (but truely) in what state I haue
liued, euer since my arriuall to the Colonie;
what hath beene the iust occasion of my
sudden departure thence; and in what
termes I haue left the same: The rather
because I perceiue, that since my comming
into England, such a coldnesse and irresolution
is bred, in many of the Aduenturers,
that some of them seeke to withdraw
those paimēts, which they haue subscribed
towards the Charge of the Plantation, and
by which that Action must bee supported
and maintained; making this my returne,

the colour of their needlesse backwardnes
and vniust protraction. Which, that you
may the better vnderstand, I must informe
your Lordships, that presently after my arriual
in Iames Towne, I was welcommed by
a hote and violent Ague, which held mee a
time, till by the aduice of my Physition,
Doctor Laurence Bohun, (by blood letting)
I was recouered, as in my first Letters by
Sir Thomas Gates I haue informed you.
That disease had not long left me, til (within
three weekes after I had gotten a little
strength) I began to be distempered with
other greeuous sicknesses, which successiuely
& seuerally assailed me: for besides
a relapse into the former disease, which
with much more violence held me more
then a moneth, and brought me to great
weakenesse, the Flux surprised me, and kept

me many daies; then the Crampe assaulted
my weak body, with strong paines; & afterwards
the Gout (with which I had heeretofore
beene sometime troubled) afflicted
mee in such sort, that making my body
through weakenesse vnable to stirre, or to
vse any maner of exercise, drew vpon me
the disease called the Scuruy; which though
in others it be a sicknesse of slothfulnesse,
yet was in me an effect of weaknesse, which
neuer left me, till I was vpon the point to
leaue the world.
            These seuerall maladies and calamities, I
am the more desirous to particularise vnto
your Lordships (although they were too
notorious to the whole Colonie) lest any
man should misdeeme that vnder the general
name and cōmon excuse of sicknes, I
went about to cloke either sloth, or feare,

or anie other base apprehension, vnworthy
the high and Honourable charge,
which you had entrusted to my Fidelitie.
            In these extremities I resolued to consult
my friends, vvho (finding Nature
spent in mee, and my body almost consumed,
my paines likewise daily encreasing)
gaue me aduise to preferre a hopefull
recouery, before an assured ruine,
which must necessarily haue ensued, had
I liued, but twenty dayes longer, in Virginia:
wanting at that instant, both food
and Physicke, fit to remedy such extraordinary
diseases, and restore that strength
so desperately decayed.
            VVhereupon, after a long consultation
held, I resolued by generall consent
and perswasion, to shippe my selfe for

               Meuis, an Island in the VVest Indies, famous
for vvholesome Bathes, there to
try what help the Heauenly Prouidence
would afford mee, by the benefit of the
hot Bath: But GOD, who guideth all
things, according to his good will and
pleasure, so prouided, that after wee had
sailed an hundred Leagues, wee met with
Southerly windes which forced mee to
change my purpose, (my body being altogether
vnable to endure the tediousnesse
of a long voyage) and so sterne my
course for the VVestern Islands, which
I no sooner recouered, then I found
help for my health, and my sickenesse
asswaged, by meanes of fresh diet, and
especially of Orenges and Lemonds, an
vndoubted remedy and medicine for that
disease, which lastly, and so long, had

afflicted mee: which ease as soone as I
found, I resolued (although my body
remained still feeble and weake, to returne
backe to my charge in Virginia againe,
but I was aduised not to hazard
my selfe before I had perfectly recouered
my strength, which by counsell I
was perswaded to seeke in the naturall
Ayre of my Countrey, and so I came
for England. In which Accident, I doubt
not but men of reason, and of iudgement
will imagine, there would more
danger and preiudice haue hapned by my
death there, then I hope can doe by my
returne
            In the next place, I am to giue accompt
in what estate I left the Collony for
gouernment in my absence. It may please
your Lordships therefore to vnderstand,

that vpon my departure thence, I made
choise of Captaine George Pearcie, (a Gentleman
of honour and resolution, and of
no small experience in that place, to remaine
Deputie Gouernour, vntill the
comming of the Marshall Sir Thomas
Dale, whose Commission was likewise to
be determined, vpon the arriuall of Sir
Thomas Gates, according to the intent and
order of your Lordships, and the Councill
here.
            The number of men I left there,
were vpward of two hundred, the most
in health, and prouided of at least tenne
moneths victuals, in their store-house,
(which is daily issued vnto them) besides
other helps in the Countrey, lately
found out by Captaine Argoll by trading
vvith pettie Kings in those parts,

who for a small returne of a piece of Iron,
Copper, &c. haue consented to trucke
great quantities of Corne, and willingly
imbrace the intercourse of Traffique,
shewing vnto our people certaine signes
of amitie and affection.
            And for the better strengthening and
securing of the Collony, in the time of my
weaknesse there, I tooke order for the
building of three seuerall Forts, two of
which are seated neere Poynt Comfort,
to which adioyneth a large Circuit of
ground, open, and fit for Corne: the
third Fort is at the Falles, vpon an Iland
inuironed also with Corne ground.
These are not all manned, for I wanted
the commoditie of Boates, hauing but
two, and one Bardge, in all the Countrey,
which hath beene cause that our

fishing hath beene (in some sort) hindered,
for want of those prouisions, which
easily will be remedied when vvee can
gaine sufficient men to be imployed about
those businesses, which in Virginia
I found not: but since meeting with
Sir Thomas Gates at the Cowes neere Portsmouth
(to whom I gaue a perticular accompt
of all my proceedings, and of the
present estate of the Collony as I left it) I
vnderstood those wants are supplyed in
his Fleete.
            The Countrey is wonderfull fertile
and very rich, and makes good whatsoeuer
heretofore hath beene reported of it,
the Cattell already there, are much encreased,
and thriue exceedingly with the
pasture of that Countrey: The Kine all
this last VVinter, though the ground

was couered most vvith Snow, and the
season sharpe, liued without other feeding
then the grasse they found, vvith
which they prospered well, and many
of them readie to fall with Calue: Milke
being a great nourishment and refreshing
to our people, seruing also (in occasion)
as well for Physicke as for food, so
that it is no way to be doubted, but when
it shall please God that Sir Thomas Dale,
and Sir Thomas Gates, shall arriue in Virginia
with their extraordinary supply of
one hundred Kine, and two hundred
Swine, besides store of all manner of other
prouisions for the sustenance and
maintenance of the Collony, there vvill
appeare that successe in the Action as
shall giue no man cause of distrust that
hath already aduentured, but encourage

euery good minde to further so worthy
a worke, as will redound both to the
Glory of GOD, to the Credit of our
Nation, and to the Comfort of all those
that haue beene Instruments in the furthering
of it.
            The last discouery, during my continuall
sicknesse, was by Captaine Argoll,
who hath found a trade with Patamack
(a King as great as Powhatan, vvho still
remaines our enemie, though not able
to doe vs hurt.) This is in a goodly Riuer
called Patomack, vpon the borders
whereof there are growne the goodliest
Trees for Masts, that may be found elsewhere
in the VVorld: Hempe better
then English, growing wilde in aboundance:
Mines of Antimonie and Leade,
            There is also found without our Bay

to the Northward an excellent fishing
Bancke for Codde, and Ling, as good
as can be eaten, and of a kinde that
will keepe a whole yeare, in Shippes
hould, with little care; a tryall whereof
I now haue brought ouer vvith mee.
Other Islands there are vpon our Coasts,
that doe promise rich merchandise, and
vvill further exceedingly the establishing
of the Plantation, by supply of many
helpes, and vvill speedily afford a
returne of many vvorthie Commodities.
            I haue left much ground in part manured
to receiue Corne, hauing caused it
the last VVinter to be sowed for rootes,
vvith vvhich our people vvere greatly
releeued.
            There are many Vines planted in

diuers places, and doe prosper vvell,
there is no vvant of any thing, if the action
can be vpheld with constancy and
resolution.
            Lastly, concerning my selfe, and my
course, though the VVorld may imagine
that this Countrey and Climate,
will (by that vvhich I haue suffered beyond
any other of that Plantation) ill agree,
vvith the state of my body, yet
I am so farre from shrinking or giuing
ouer this honourable enterprise, as that
I am vvilling and ready to lay all I am
worth vpon the aduenture of the Action,
rather then so Honourable a worke
should faile, and to returne vvith all the
conuenient expedition I may, beseeching
your Lordships, and the rest, not onely
to excuse my former wants, happened

by the Almighty hand: but to second
my resolutions vvith your friendly indeauours:
that both the State may receiue
Honour, your selues Profit, and
I future Comfort, by being imployed
(though but as a weake Instrument) in
so great an Action.
            And thus hauing plainely, truely,
and briefely, deliuered the cause of my
returne, vvith the state of our affayres,
as wee now stand, I hope euery vvorthy
and indifferent hearer, will by comparing
my present resolution of returne,
with the necessitie of my comming home,
rest satisfied with this true and short Declaration.
            FINIS.
