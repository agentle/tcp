                  SEcundae cogitationes are euer (they ſay) meliores;
and why may not then ſecundae Cantiones be as well
dulciores? I preſume they are ſo, and that makes me
reſume this vaine, with hope that I ſhall not conſume
in vaine my labour herein.
            For firſt, the kinde acceptation of the former Impreſsion is as a
new invitation to this latter Edition, though not of the ſame
things, yet of things of the ſame condition; full of the ſame delectation,
made to pleaſe, as the other were; to pleaſe I ſay, and that
with as much eaſe, as the other; made truely Muſicall with Art
by my correction, and yet plaine, and capable with eaſe, by my
direction.
            
            Againe, Bonum quò communius eò melius, we know; and I know
no reaſon, why incundum, quò communius, ſhould not be as well
iucundius: Now then the nature of theſe (call them as you will)
in regard of their facilitie and ſo their capabilitie is more communicable,
then any other kinde of Muſicke, and in this reſpect more

               commendable; and will be I am ſure more acceptable, becauſe the
things which many heretofore haue priuately ioyed in, may now
by this meanes, publikely be inioyed.
            
            Neither, can he, that is the moſt able Muſition ſay, but that of
theſe moſt men, almoſt all men are capable, that are not altogether
immuſicall: Neither can He, that is moſt ſpitefull ſay, but they
are very delighfull, I, and ſome way gainfull too; (yet more painefull
to me, I am ſure, then gainefull.) But, though there bee but
little to bee gotten by them, yet pittie were it, ſuch Mirth ſhould
be forgotten of vs; And therefore to make an end, I ſay no more
but 1/M Siquid nouiſti dulc̄ius iſtis.
