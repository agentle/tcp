               Bycauſe that Abels ſacrifice,
               Of God was accepted,
               And Cayns neglected,
               This miſcheife he dyd deuiſe.
            
            
               This manſlaughtor,
               God dyd abhor,
               And curſed wicked Cayn,
               He dyed a lyke death,

               Of him came many holy men,

               For their infidelitie,
               wer drowned in Noes flood then.
            
            
               Thei deſpiſed God,

               Builded the towre of Babilon,
               But in that building,
               God not deliting,
               He brought it to deſtruction.
            
            
               The firſt kingdome than,
               By Nemrod began,
               Among the Babilonians.
               Through Idolatry,
               And liuing vngodly,
               It came to the Aſſirians.
            
            
               Then Sardanapall,
               Moſt lecherous of all,
               Of his kingdome was depriued,
               For his yll liuing,
               His Office neglecting,
               His people were then deuided.

               Therin they were brent,
               They wolde not repent,
               They lyued ſo delicatly.
            
            
               Ioſeph moſt prudent,
               In his gouernment,
               Brought the Egiptians in religiō
               
               He ſet vp godly fere,

               with Gods people then,
               Paſſed clene through that way.
            
            
               Kyng Roboam,
               was a wylfull man.
               He ſet nought by his counſell olde,
               For diuers thinges,
               To his ſubiectes vndoinges,
               To obey them he neuer wolde.
            
            
               Releaſe nought he wolde,
               That he vniuſtly did hold,
