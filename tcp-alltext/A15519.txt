            The Prologue.
            TO sit on Honors seate, it is a loftie reach,
            To seeke for praise by making bragges, oft times doth get a breach.
            We list not ride the rowling rackes, that dims the christall skies,
            We mean to set no glimmering glance before your curteous eies:
            VVe search not Plutoes pensiue pit, nor taste of Limbo lake:
            VVe do not shew of warlike fight, as shield and sword to shake:
            VVe speak not of the powers diuine, ne yet of furious sprights:
            VVe do not seeke high hils to clime, nor talke of loues delights▪
            
            VVe do not here present to you the threshar with his flayle,
            Ne do we here present to you the milk-maid with her payle:
            VVe shew not you of countrey toile, as hedger with his bill:
            VVe do not bring the husbandman to lop and top with skill:
            VVe pay not here the Gardners part to plant, to set and sow:
            You meruaile then what wares we haue to furnish out our show.
            Your patience yet we craue a while till we haue trimd our stall:
            Then yong and old come and behold our wares, & buy them all.
            Then if our wares shall seeme to you, well wouen, good & fine,
            VVe hope we shall your custome haue againe another time.
            FINIS.
         
      
      
         
            
            A pythie and pleasant Comoedie
of the three Ladies of London.
            
               The first Act.
               Enter Fame sounding before Loue and Conscience.
               
                  Loue.
                  LAdie Conscience, what shall we say to our estates,
                  to whom shall we complaine?
                  O
                        •
                      how shall we avridge such fates, as heapeth vp our paine?
                  Tis Lucar now that rules the rout, tis she is all in all,
                  
                     
                        •
                     is she that holds her head so stout, in fine tis she that works our fal.
                  Oh Conscience, I feare, I feare a day,
                  that we by her and Usurie shall quite be cast away.
               
               
                  Con.
                  Indeed I feare the worst, for euerie man doth sew
                  and comes from countreys strange and farre, of her to haue view.
                  Although they ought to seeke true Loue and Conscience cleare:
                  but Loue and Conscience few doo like, that 
                        •
                     eane on Lucars chaire.
                  Men ought be rulde by vs, we ought in them beare sway:
                  so should each neighbor liue by other in good estate alway.
               
               
                  Loue.
                  For Lucar men come from Italy, Barbarie, Turkie,
                  From Iurie: nay the Pagan himselfe,
                  Indangers his bodie to gape for her pelfe.
                  They forsake mother, prince countrey, religion, kiffe and kin,
                  Nay men care not what they forsake, so ladie Lucar they win.
                  That we poore ladies may sigh te see our states thus turned and tost,
                  and worse and worse is like to be, where Lucar rules the rost.
               
               
                  Con.
                  You say the truth, yet God I trust will not admit it so,
                  that Loue and Conscience by Lucars lust shall catch an ouerthrow.
               
               
                  Fame.
                  Good ladies rest content, and you no doubt shall see
                  them plagud with painfull punishment for such their crueltie:
                  And if true Loue and Conscience liue from Lucars lust lasciuious,
                  thou Fame a triple crowne will giue, which lasteth ay victorious.
               
               
                  Con.
                  God grant that Conscience keep within the bounds of right,
                  and that vile Lucar doo not daunt her heart with deadly spight.
               
               
                  Loue.
                  And grant O God that Loue be found in citie, towne & countrie,
                  which causeth wealth and peace abound, and pleaseth God almightie.
               
               
                  Fame.
                  But Ladies, ist your pleasure to walke abroad a while,
                  and recreate your selues with measure your sorrowes to beguile.
               
               
                  Con.
                  Passe on good Fame, your steps doo frame, on you we will attend,
                  and pray to God that holds the rod, our states for to defend.
               
               Exeunt.
Enter Dissimulation, hauing on a Farmers long coate, and a cap, and
his poll and beard painted motley.
               
                  Dissim.

                  They may well thinke that see me, my honestie is fled.
                  
                     
Tush, a figge for honestie, tut let that go.
                  Sith men, women, and children my name and doings do know.
                  My name is Dissimulation, and no base mind I beare,
                  For my outward effects my inward zeale do declare:
                  For men do dissemble with their wiues, & their wiues with them again,
                  So that in the hearts of them I alwaies remaine:
                  The child dissembles with his father, the sister with her brother,
                  the mayden with her mistris, and the yongman with his louer,
                  There is Dissimulation betweene neighbor and neighbor, friend and
friend, one with another.
                  Betweene the seruant and his maister, betweene brother and brother,
                  then why make you it strange that euer you knew me,
                  Seeing so often I raunge throughout euery degree?
                  But forget my basenes, ile towards London as fast as I can,

And because they spied thy knauerie, away thou didst goe.

                  And to London we hye it is our chiefest intent,
                  to see if we can get entertainment of the Ladies or no.

                  Yes they will be sure to winne the diuell and all,
                  Or else theyle make a man to spue out his gall:
                  O that vile Usury, he lent my father a little mony, & for breking one day,
                  He tooke the see

                     simple of his house and mill quite away:
                  And yet he borrowed not halfe a quarter so much as it cost,
                  But I thinck if it had been but a shilling it had been lost:
                  So he kild my father with sorrow, and vndid me quite,
                  And you deale with him sirs, you shall finde him a knaue full of spight,
                  And Simon I perse I. Symonie too, he is a knaue for the nonce,
                  He loues to haue twentie liuings at once:

                  And he seekes to get Parsons liuings into his hand,
                  And puts in some odd dunce that to his paiment will stand:
                  So, if the parsonage be worth fortie or fiftie pound a yere,
                  He will giue one twentie nobles to mumble seruice once a month there.
                  Symonie and Vsurie both.
                  What rascall is he, that speakes by vs such villanie?

where each one in his office in great honor shall stay.
                  But Usurie didst thou neuer know my grandmother the old Ladie Lucar
of Uenice.

                  Yes Madame, I was seruant unto her, and liued ther in blisse.

                  But why camest thou into England, seeing Uenice is a Citie

                  Vsurie.
                  I haue often heard your good grandmother tell,

ancient religious citie:
                  On a time the monkes a friers made a banket, whereto they inuited me
                  with certaine other English merchants, which belike were of their familiaritie.

                  we are cunning anglers, we haue caught the fattest fish,
                  Certainly it is true that her grandmother told.
                  Here is good to be done by vse of siluer and gold.
                  And seeing we are so well setled in this countrey,

                  Sirra, being at Rome, and dwelling in the Friarie,
                  they would talke how England yerely sent ouer a great masse of money:
                  and that this little Yland was more worth to the Pope,
                  than three bigger Realmes that had a great deale more scope:
                  For here were smoke pence, peter pence, and powle pence to be paid,
                  besides much other money that to the Popes vse was made.
                  Why, it is but lately since the Pope receiued this fine,
                  Not much more than 33. yeares since, it was in Queene Maries time.
                  But England had neuer knowen what this great had meant,
                  Had frier Austen from the Pope not hether been sent.
                  For the Pope hearing it to be a little Yland, sent him with a great Armie
ouer.
                  And winning the victorie, he landed about Rye, Sandwych, or Douer.
                  Then he erected lawes hauing the people in subiection,
                  and for the most part, England hath paid tribute so long.
                  I hearing of the great store and wealth in the Countrey,
                  could not chuse but perswade myselfe the people loued symonie.

euery thing,
                  And for these good commodities, trifles into England thou must bring:
                  As Bugles to make bables, coloured bones, glasse beades to make bracelettes
withall:
                  For euery day Gentlewomen of England doe aske for such trifles from
stall to stall,

such bable,
                  
                     
That is slight pretty and pleasant, they care not to haue it prefitable.
                  And if they demaund wherefore your wares and merchandize agree,
                  You must lay Ieat will take vp a straw, Amber will make one fat,
                  Corrall will looke pale when you besicke, and Christall wil stanch blad,
                  So with lying, flattering, and glosing you must vtter your ware,
                  And you shall winne me to your will, if you can deceitfully sweare.

                  This was Nicholas Nemo, and no man hath no place.
                  then how can I speed well in this kind of case?
                  And no man bid me to dinner, when shall I dine?
                  Or how shall I find him, where, when, and at what time?
                  wherefore the reliefe had and to be had is small,
                  But to speake truth, the reliefe is nothing at all.
                  But come Simplicitie, let vs go see what may be had,

                  You know when one comes to take possession of any peece of land
                  There must not be one within, for against the order of lawe it doth
stand.
                  Therefore I thought good to aske you, but I pray you thinke not amisse:
                  For both you, and almost all other knowes, that an old custome it is.

hinder you.

                  Were it not for Hospitalitie, we knew not whither to goe.
                  Great is the miserie that we poore ladyes abide,
                  And much more is the crueltie of Lucar and Usury beside.
                  O Conscience, thou art not accounted of, O Loue, thou art little set by,
                  For almost euery one, true loue, and pure conscience doth denie:
                  So hath Lucar crept into the bosome of man, woman and child,
                  That euery one doth practise his deare friend to beguile.
                  But God graunt Hospitalitie be not by them ouer prest,

                  Because he for the poore and comfortlesse doth prouide.
                  Here he comes, that hath vndone many an honest man,
                  And daily seeks to destroy, deface, and bring to ruine if he can.

                  I haue taken possession, and because they were destitute,
                  I haue let it for a quarter my tale to conclude.
                  Marry I haue a little raised the rent, but it is but after forty pound by
the yeare:
                  But if it were to let now, would let it more deare.

                  So dat they make shift to be ten houses in one very gladly.
                  And be content a for pay fiftie or threescore pound a yeare,

That great rents vpon little roome do bestow.
                  Yes I warrant you, and truly I may thanke the straungers for this,
                  That they haue made houses so deare, whereby I liue in blisse.

                  Mary there was neuer a scutchin, but there was 2 trees rampant

                  Hauing a hempten halter about his necke, with a knot vnder the left

                  Then vnder the helmet hung tables like chaines, and for what they are
I cannot deuise.

                  Mary the difference is all, which is the knot vnder the left eare.
                  the Painter saies when he is hangd, you may put out the knot without
feare.
                  I am sure they were your armes, for there was written in Romane

shall say,

                  Geron.
                  Then learned Iudge attend; this Mercadorus, whome you
see in place,
                  Did borrow two thousand duckats of me, but for a fiue weeks space.
                  Then sir, before the day came, by his flatterie he obtained one thousand
more,
                  And promist me at two monthes ende I should receiue my store:
                  But before the time expired, he ws closely fled away,
                  So that I neuer heard of him, at least this two yeeres day,
                  till at the last I met with him, and did the money did demand,
                  Who sware to me at fiue daies end he would pay me out of hand.
                  The fiue daies came, and three daies more, then one day he requested:
                  
                     
I perceiuing that he flowted me, haue got him thus arrested:
                  And now he comes in Turkish weedes to defeat me of my monie,
                  But I trow he will not forsake his faith, I deeme he hath more honestie.
               
               
                  Iudge.
                  Sir Gerontus you knowe, if any man forsake his faith, King,
country, and become a Mahomet.
                  All debts are paide, tis the law of our Realme, and you may not gainesay
it.

                  Turning me out of house and home, and in the end,
                  my gowne to pait my rent, to him I did send;
                  So driuen to that extremitie, I haue fallen to that you see,
                  Yet after iudgement I hope of Gods mercie.
               
               
                  Iudge.
                  O Conscience, shall cankered quam corrupt thy heart?
                  Or shall want in this world cause thee to feele euerlasting sma

                  O Conscience what a small time thou hast on earth to liue,
                  why doest thou not then, to God all honor giue?
                  Considering the time is euerlasting that thou shalt liue in blisse,
                  If by thy life thou rise from death, to iudgement mercie, and forgiuenes.
                  
                  Enter Loue with Diligence.
                  Stand aside Conscience, bring Loue to the barre.
                  What saiest thou to thy deformitie, who was the cause?
               
               
                  Loue.
                  Ladie Lucar.
               
               
                  Iudge.
                  Did Lucar choke thee so, that thou gauest thy selfe ouer to lust?
                  And did prodigall expences cause thee in Dissimulation to trust?
                  Thou wast pure Loue, and art thou become a monster,
                  Bolstring thy selfe vpon the lasciuiousnes of Lucar?
                  Loue answere for thy selfe, speake in thy defence.
               
               
                  Loue.
                  I cannot chuse but yeeld, confounded by Conscience.
               
               
                  Iudge.
                  Then iudgement I pronounce on thee, because thou followed
Lucar,
                  Whereby thou hast solde thy soule to feele like torment with her,
                  Which torments comprehended are in the worme of Conscience,
                  who raging still, shall nere haue end, a plague for thine offence,
                  Care shall be thy comfort, and sorrow shall thy life sustaine,
                  thou shalt be dying, yet neuer dead, but pining still in endlesse paine.
                  Diligence conuey her to Lucar, let that be her reward,
                  Because vnto her cankered coyne she gaue her whole regard.
                  But as for Conscience, carrie her to prison,
                  there to remaine vntill the day of generall session:
                  Thus we make an end,
                  Knowing that the best of vs all may amend:
                  UUhich God graunt to his good will and pleasure,
                  That we be not corrupted with the vnsatiate desire of vanishing earthly
treasure:
                  For Couetousnesse is the cause of wresting mans Conscience,
                  Therefore restraine thy lust, and thou shalt shun the offence.
