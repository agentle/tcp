            TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE LORD Robert Deuorax, Earle of Eſſex and Ewe, Vicount of Hereford and Bowrchier, Lord Ferrers of Chartley, Burchaier and Louaine, maiſter of the Queenes Maieſties horſe, and knight of the moſt honourable order of the Garter I H. wiſheth all heauenly happineſſe, and increaſe of honourable vertue.
            
               THe ſtate and condition of true nobilititie, ſubiect ſtill to fatall deſtinies, or rather to the deuine direction of the moſt higheſt is ſuch (right honourable) that whether you regard the vertue, from which it originallie ſprong: or reſpect the honour by which it continually holdeth, you ſhall neuer find it vnfauoured of the better, nor vnſpighted of the baſer ſorte: By which two ſpurres of praiſe, and diſpraiſe, as it were pricked foreward, it runneth in a ſpeedie and voluntarie courſe, the right, and perfect race to earthly felicitie, the rich, and preſent poſſeſsion, whereof is a plaine, and eaſie paſſage, to that heauenly paradiſe, to which your father to the great griefe of all good men, though to his great, and vnſpeakeable ioy, is lately gone: who leauing behind him, the ſame ſteps for you to tread in, that he traced, the ſame pathes for you to wander in that he walked in before you, leaſt at his death, ſo liuely a pattern for you to imitate, as neither our preſent age can affoord you any more vertues, nor any age paſt: many more valiant? Sith then of theſe two points, the very ſound and ſolide ſubſtance of true nobilitie) you haue in your own houſe, ſo rare a preſident of freſh memorie, proceed right honorable (as you haue well begun) ſo by this line to leuell all your actions, as in becomming ſuch a ſonne, of ſuch a father, you may proue more wiſe, then by inioying his lands, & poſſeſsions ſeem fortunate. The way that he walkt in, lay as far wide of vice, as vertue her ſelfe, in fleſh and bloud cold pace it out, by which he grewe ſo deare to her ſacred Maieſtie, ſo acceptable to his peeres, & ſo regarded of the multitude, that it were hard to geſſe whether he were more fauoured, more beloued, or more honored. This vvay though in ſome apparance it lie opē to the vvide vvorld, and ſo by that meanes, common to you vvith many, yet by a

ſpecial prerogatiue, it is peculier but to a fevv, among whom, your honour ſo hold it by inheritance, that not to challenge your right therein, vvere but to diſclaime your diſſent, and to aſſume the poſſeſsion, is but to accept of your ovvne title: vvhich in the opinion of ſuch as knovve you vvell, you may lavvfully auerre: vvhereunto I vvill forbeare longer to exhort you, as vvell for that your forvvardneſſe already, ſtirred vp by a naturall inclination, preuentes all forraine perſwaſions: as for that I knovv you to be furniſhed vvith men ofſuch vvorth, vvhom in all honorable affabilitie it pleaſeth you to conuerſe vvith, as that herein, an abler mans councell then mine ovvne, may ſeeme either ſuperfluous, or friuolous. Your late expedition into Portingall (hovvſoeuer the euent ſorted out) yeelded to the indifferent cenſure of euerie man, a moſte pregnant proofe of a martiall mind: at vvhat time the skilful and expert captain, took as good occaſion to wonder at your ſinguler vallor: as the ſick, maymed, and poore ſimple ſouldier to cōmend your liberal boūty: both which are ſo deeply impreſſed in their harts that ſaw, & felt them, as nothing but death ſhall enforce a forgetfulneſſe. And now right honorable acknowledging my ſlender report herein, to be too baſe, & beare a record, for matter of ſo great conſequence, and carrying no minde (for ſundry dutifull reſpects) to regiſter anie part of the voiage: I leaue to ſpeake more thereof: In all lowly humilitie, moſte humbly beſeeching you, to auouch the patrionage of this my ſimple, and plaine tranſlation, wherein I haue endeuoured to deliuer into Engliſhe, that vvhich ſometime Ioſephus Quercetanus the author, left both in lattin, and in freſh, to the great benefite of his countrey men: and all other that take notice thereof, the ſubiect being a moſt learned, & profitable diſcourſe, of the cure of vvoundes, gotten by gunſhot, a matter in this tumultious and troubleſome time in knovvledge acceptable: and for neceſsitie commendable, in vvhich patronage, you ſhall not onely ioyne partner vvith a mightie Prince, Frances late brother to the french king, but alſo, by countenancing the booke, continue the good opinion, that ſoldiers generally haue conceiued of you, vvhereof I preſume you make no ſmall accompt. And ſo vviſhing to your honor, all maner of happineſſe, euen to the fulneſſe of your ovvne content, I humbly take my leaue.
            
               Your honours moſt duetifull, Iohn Heſter.
            
         
         
            
            THE EPISTLE TO THE READER.
            
               IT is credibly recorded that one and the ſelfe ſame Citie of Ments in Germany, about one and the ſelfe ſame time found out and deliuered to poſteritie two inuentions of rare and woonderfull importance, the Print and the Gunne: the former not ſo gratefull for the exceeding good, which thereby to euery man doth or may enſue: as the latter, for the exceſſiue hurt threatned to all men is vngratious, and yet both at this day in ſuch requeſt, as it were hard to ſay whether Mars his knights more value the one, then Mineruas ſchollers account of the other, ſo that as both haue for beginning their authors and founders, ſo for continuance they both want not their fautors and maintainers: neither is or can the priuiledge of the one be any way preiudice to the other, but either ſtands or falles in eſtimation, as ſundrie men to either are ſeuerally conceited. Leauing therefore the print to the learned, who when and where they liſt, can deliuer you in good and ſweete termes the vſe, neceſſitie, and commendation thereof: I haue choſen with mine Author to ſpeake a little of the other, or rather of the cure of ſuch deadly wounds, as by the furious breath of ſo dangerous a deuiſe are procured to vs, and that not in ſmooth and curious phraſe, or picked eloquence, the roughneſſe of the matter vtterly reiecting, any ſuch ſoft handling, but in blunt and rude wordes, ſuch as beſt ſute and ſort with the ſubiect it ſelfe. And here it is no part of my meaning with any curioſitie to enquire whether the vnhappie inuention of this churliſh engine be fetcht from the Fryar, or from the diuell, or from a ioynt councell of them both, helde by conſent in Vulcans fyery ſhoppe, I leaue that charge and the ſearch thereof to my maſters the Germaines, or to any man elſe, yt ſeekes out of ſo boiſterous an inuention. To challenge any ciuil commendation, it ſhall ſuffiſe me, in an Engliſh toonge to tel you a Frenchmans tale, a tale, or rather a diſcourſe as auailable to redreſſe the iniuries inferd by ſhot (where the ſtripe is not mortall) as the gun almoſt was to inforce the harmes: wherein although diuers authors haue diuerſly written, euery one according to the model of his learning and experience, as of the french Laurentius Iubertus and Botellus: of the Italians Alfonſus Ferrius and Iohannes Vigo, of the Engliſh Thomas Gale and William Clovves, and ſundry of

other countries, as euery man hath founde leiſure and aff
                  •••
               ion to trauell in a matter ſo needfull: ſome laying open the nature of the wounds, as well in concuſion as dilaceration, ſome deliuering the malignant and venomous qualitie, proceeding from the mixture of the powder: others leauing both theſe, beſtow their whole endeuour in the diſcouery of ſuch medicines, as to themſelues or to ſuch of whom they borowed their light, might any way ſeeme fitteſt. Among all which our Quercetanus, as it werem a middle courſe betweene both lightly goeth ouer the cauſes, and ſettles himſelfe wholly vpon the cure: in which as his method is exquiſite, ſo are his medicines ſingular: the ſame for the moſt part agreeing in ſubſtance with thoſe of Antiquitie, but differing much in preparation, for the which many condemne him, as ſtraying from the old beaten and knowne way, but theſe men forget that artes which whilome were in their nonage, haue grown in proceſſe to a more ripe and perfite middle age, and if they be not in time prouided for, may eaſily decline (as moſt things els do) and fall into a dotage, of ſuch force and waight is and euer yet hath bene the due conſideration of time and circumſtance, let vs ſhew our ſelues thankfull to ſuch, as pittying the imperfections of others, ſeekes to furniſh vs with better ſupplies. And as Quercetanus with his owne countrimen, and all that vnderſtand the Latine tongue, hath herein deſerued wonderfull commendation: ſo let me (gentle reader) that haue laid him as open to thee, as he is to any other, find thy friendly acceptacion, and ſo much the rather becauſe whatſoeuer I haue offended in the rudeneſſe of my tranſlation, in the diligent preparing of the medicines, I heere promiſe to amende. Many things not without great charge and painefull labour, I haue already performed, to theſe and diuers other hard cures not impertinent, and if there be any thing elſe to make, that to this Spagiricall art doth any way belong, the learned, or practitioned ſhall finde me ready vpon reaſonable conſideration to performe all, and whatſoeuer my poore tallent can afford.

            That Monk or Frier accurſt may be, that bent his wat ſo wickedly,
            By ſalt peter and other ſtuffe, through ſhot of Gun moſt cruelly.
            To murther men at vnawares, by ſodaine ſtroke of bullet ſhot,
            So as no force can now preuaile, & ſtrength of men is quite forgot.
            For where theſe engines come in place, mens bodies there are rent and torne,
            And many thē looſe leg or arme, & bodies maimd are left forlorne.
            But monſieur du Cheſne we wel may bleſſe, whoſe godly care and happie ſkill,
            Hath found a mean to eaſe this grief, & how the rage of ſhot to ſtil.
            Yea he the meane hath well ſet downe, to heale all Gunſhot with good ſpeede,
            Which was a worthy deed of his, & comfort yeelds to ſuch as need.

            A TREATISE MADE BY THAT FAmous Phiſitian Ioſephus Quercetanus, and intituled his Sclopetarie: wherein is contained the perfect curation of ſuch wounds, which comes by ſhot of gun or by any other engine of warre.
            
               CHAP. 1. Sundrie diſputations of the eſſence of woundes by ſhot, and of the venome and blaſting ioyned therewith.
               
                  IT may be, it will ſeeme ſuperfluous to ſome, that I haue thought it conuenient to ſet out this Treatiſe of curing woundes by gunſhot, of the which diuers, and eſpecially that excellent phiſition Laurentius Iubertus hath ver
                     •
                  e lately ſo diligently and fully written, that there is not let paſſe anie thing, that pertaineth to the eſſence or nature of ſuch wounds. The which being found out and knowne, preſently the chiefeſt and trueſt way of curing is ſhewed, and that ſame did that learned man Iubertus moſte excellently and orderly ſet out in his booke: but yt cauſes, why I was not withdrawn by the authoritie of this man, from my pretended purpoſe, chieflie was the burden of inconueniences of theſe woundes which we intend to treate of, & next a naturall deſire (from my birth) placed in me of the immortall God, to bring (as much as in me 
                     •
                  teth) ſome helpe to mankinde, and eſpeciallie to mine owne countrimen, for whoſe ſakes I haue alſo publiſhed this litle booke in the French toong, wherein I doubt not but that I ſhall bring to light ſome excellent remedies neither knowne to thoſe which wrote before me, neither yet to the common people: the vſe of which I haue learned both of excellent Phiſitions and chyrurgions, partly when I trauelled in ſundry dominions of Europe, and partly by the familiar companie which I had with moſt ſkilfull Phiſitions abroad in the campes. And firſt I will ſet downe my opinion concerning the eſſence and nature of

ſuch woundes: the which queſtion (by the conſent of all that haue written thereof) is the mincipalleſt. Batallus, Iubertus and Paraeus haue deliuered to vs that the hurts by gunſhot are accompained with two inconueniences, that is, they conſiſt of ſolution of continuitie, and bruſing, with rending oftentimes of the muſcles, veſſels, and fleſh, to the which manie accidentes d
                     •
                  o come, the which be
                     •
                  ng diuers, muſt needs haue diuers intentions of curation. Theſe are the two ſortes of inconueniences, of the which by diſputation they haue agreed on, woundes by gunſhot to conſiſt, and therefore they haue ſet downe two kindes of remedies, one wherewith the partes ſo torne and wanne are holpen, that is the fleſh, ſinewes, lygamentes, tendons, ioyntes and bones, and that by meanes of the bruſe, the which may come to paſſe without anie manifeſt wound at all, and of the Erccians is called Ecchymooſis, yet not without daunger, but oftentimes ſubiect to great accidentes, and manie times hath great effuſion of bloud betweene the muſcles, which when it is ſhed out of the vaines, preſently putrifieth; alſo great aches, which are accompanied with great fiuxe of humours, diuers ſwellinges, inflamations, and at the laſt Gangrena and mortification of the part affected.
               The other ſort which comes with a manifeſt wound is more daily ſeene, and the deeper and greater it is, ſo much it is thought the more dangerous, becauſe the ſhot (whether of lead or braſſe) the more vehementer it goeth in, ſo much the more it bruſeth the parts in which it entreth, by the which cauſe the bloud is congealed which falleth in the hollownes of the wounde, and filleth the orofice of the veines and hollownes of the other partes, & then being deſtitute of his natur all heate (the which being quenched and mortified by the reſolution of the ſpirits, & by reaſō of the paine & tearing of ſo many parts, it goeth againe to the ſpring heade, that is to the heart, by reaſon of the feare which is takē with the deadly hurt) it becomes of a wanniſh & leady colour, like to that which the common ſort calleth Aſure, the which is eaſily rotted, and eaſily doth rot the parts adioyning, and eſpecially the Spermatical: the which according to the opinion of our aunceſters, is eaſily turned to quitture: and that the eaſier and ſpeedier this fleſhe being bruſed and dead, may be ſeparated from the quicke and liuely fleſh, the Chyrurgions doe commonly vſe remedia ſuppu

                        •
                     tia & mollientia▪
                   the vſe of which, alth
                     •
                  ugh it bee 
                     〈◊〉
                   vſed in common bruſes, yet in theſe

hurts it may not be followed without graue & waightie conſiderations, and eſpecially without conſideration had of the body, time, and part, for in ſo much as theſe woundes doe eaſily admit great ſtore of putrifaction, ſo that manie times wormes are ingendred with intollerable putrifaction, it is not to be doubted, but that by the vſe of ſuche medicines, which by nature moue putrifaction, the griefe is increaſed and augmented, through euil vapors, wherewith the principall partes, that is to ſay, the heart, the braine and liuer are moleſted, whereof come crampes and phrenſies with continuall feuers, and ſo commonly death followeth: But this happeneth for the moſte parte in bodies filled with euill iuice, whoſe fleſh, when it is agreeued through putrifaction of the bloud, it is no maruell if the wound be verie dangerous and verie hard, or not at all to be cured. In this caſe the diſpoſition of the aire and heauens, is to bee conſidered, and alſo the qualitie and ſtate of the member hurted. Who alſo doubteth but that through the entrāce of the South winde into the hollowneſſe of theſe wounds, whereby naturall heate is weakened, there is great occaſion to increaſe the putrifaction and generation of wormes, which is ſeen by dayly experience: that I may ouerpaſſe the authoritie of Hipocrates lib. Apho. 3. and in his booke de Epid. which alſo he ſignifieth in another place, where he teacheth that drith is more healthier then moiſture, and ſo all corruption to come of ouermuch moyſture, as it were of his proper matter. And to this purpoſe alſo it ſhall greatly auaile vs to haue a perfect knowledge of the temperamentes of partes, for wounds in the head, bottome of the ſtomacke and other moyſt partes, and therefore more apt to putrifaction, although they be bruiſed, doe require of vs the vſe of ſuppurantia, but yet not without great iudgement and heede taking, for becauſe in this caſe great hurt doth often come through the vnſkilfulneſſe and raſhneſſe of the Phiſition: neyther at anie time ſhall the Phiſition be excuſed, although he ſee the wound verie muche ſtinking (which is alwaies an euill ſigne) or berayed with ſtincking matter and wormes, (which may come to paſſe in one day by reaſons afore alledged) yet I ſay he may not vſe medicines called commonly Digeſtiues, although he reaſon, that it is a bruſed wound, & therefore muſt come to ſuppuration, becauſe theſe incommodities drawing on, we muſt preſently haue recourſe to ſuch medicines as reſiſt putrifaction, that the moſte dangerous accidentes may be preuented,

which are threatned by that which is ſaid before, that is to ſay Gangrena, Sphacelus and mortification of the whole members. Such medicines are the ſalts both mettaline and meane minerall drawne out eſpecially of copper, iron, mercurie, vitriol, ſulphur, arſnick, and orpiment, as we ſhall declare in ſuch place where we ſhall intreate of curation, for theſe ſaltes hauing the office of an exterior Baulme, doo by their heate and ſubtleneſſe, cut and make thinne, thicke humours, which doo choake naturall heate, and doo by their ſaltneſſe and ſharpneſſe, withſtand putrifaction: they doe defend the wound from Gangrena and mortification, and doo prepare the way (being mixed with meet medicines, as hereafter ſhall be declared) to an eaſie and ſhort curing, and that without paine.
               Farre better medicines ſurely, then ſimple precipitate commonly prepared, or Egiptiacum, that ſpecially which hath arſnicke and ſublymate in it, or ſuch like, whoſe common and dayly vſe I can ſcarſlie allowe, by reaſon of the great paine which they bring to the patient, of whome we ought to haue a great and ſpeciall regard: the which incommodities may eaſily be auoyded, by a true and apt ſpagiricall preparation, which will be a great ſolace and comforte to the ſound patient. Hitherto concerning the firſt remedies, which are appointed to the firſt intention, that is, to the reſtoring of members bruſed & torne, in which 
                     •
                  aſe it 
                     •
                  ehoueth to be a wiſe & warie phiſition, in altering the medicines, and applie them as occaſion do ſerue to ſundrie affections and ſodaine mutations, that ſo it be foreſeene in all the whole ſickeneſſe, as Galen alſo hath taught.
               The ſecond kinde of medicines, which ſerue to a more generall intention, pertaine to conſolidate togither partes diſioyned, the which is chiefely performed by the diligence of the radicall and naturall Baulme, which is preſent in euerie part, as the principall doer, and chiefeſt workemaſter, being maintained with fit and conuenient nouriſhment, which balme hath great power and ſtrength in vniting and knitting togither of partes diſioyned: and this Baulme, as the cauſe principall and efficient, muſt be defended by the Phiſition, who muſt fore-ſee, that the ſtrength and efficacie therof, by no meanes be hindred: & muſt keepe from it al outward cauſes which are noyſome and hurtfull thereunto, and alſo all ſuch as haue power to hinder the conſolidation thereof: which he may do both by orderly kinde of dyet, & by applications of meete medicines. Theſe reaſons (as I may conclude in few words) do ſignifie

to vs two ſorts of griefes which wounds by gunſhot are accompanied with, that is to ſay, ſolution of continuitie, with bruſing and rending of the ſoft, meane, and ſound parts of mans bodie: and indeede, it oftentimes ſo falleth out. And theſe two intentions curatiue (as I may ſay) were ſufficient for vs, were it not that I can eaſily prooue, as well by reaſon as experience, and alſo by the fauour of moſt brauemen which haue written before me, that theſe wounds are commonly accompanied with venome and blaſting, the which two being adioyned, do
                     •

Notwithſtanding we haue not ſpoken this to the intent to defend thoſe, which haue thought this venome to come of the powder, partly through his eſſence, and partly by the tranſmutation thereof: of which opinion was Iohn de Vigo, otherwiſe an excellent and learned Chirurgion, and nowe lately renewed by one Alphonſus Ferrius an Italian Phiſitiō, whoſe diſputation is learnedly confuted by Botallus, Phiſition to the king, and alſo in Chirurgerie moſt excellent. For the compoſition of the pouder eſpecially declares, that the nature thereof can bee by no meanes venemous, in that it conſiſteth of brimſtone, ſalt-peter & coale, all which ſimples are without venome, and alſo ſo holſome, that they haue great vertue in expelling of ſtrong diſeaſes: and amongſt theſe, brimſtone (vpon which Alphonſus eſpecially groundeth his diſputation) is moſt excellēt for diſeaſes of the Lungs, ſo be it, it be right and orderly prepared, as we haue taught in our booke, of the Spagirical preparation of medicines: and that ſame may be learned out of the writinges of Galen, Theophraſt, Plinie, Dioſcorides, and alſo by the dayly vſe and experience of our France, and other nations. For the Phiſitions diſpairing the curing of any notable diſeaſe, doo ſend their patients to the whot Bathes, which are in Bearnia, Germany, Subaudia and Italy, the which waters running through the mettaline vaines of the earth, they do retaine ſome of the ſpirit of Sulphur, ſome of Alome, ſome of Nyter, ſome of Vitrioll and ſuch like: yet notwithſtanding they are not wont to be deadly, but holſome, and eſpecially thoſe, which taſt of Sulphur and Nyter, the which are very profitable againſt the palſie, Sciatica, ſtone, long griefes of the ſtomake, and ſuch other Tartarous diſeaſes, whoſe cauſe is reſolued and purged by vrine by the diureticall and percing power, which proceedeth of the ſpirits of theſe mettals: which dayly experience doth teach by the incredible curation

And I let paſſe to declare, how that ſome doo carrie the bullets long time after they are ſtroken in their bodies, without any hurt at all: And therefore that we may aunſwere to this neceſſarie queſtion, I plainly confeſſe that lead being plainly and ſimplie in his owne nature conſidered, cannot bring any venome to the wound, except it be outwardly poiſoned, which thing is not hard to be done, euery man knoweth: neither I thinke doth any man doubt, but that leade (although in his ſubſtance it is more heauie and earth

               Likewiſe Theophraſtus lib. Plant. 9. cap. 15. writeth, that among the Ethiopians there groweth a venemous roote, with which they are woont to annoint their arrowes: the ſame doth Plinie write of the Scithians lib. 12. cap. 53, and Paulus Aegineta in his ſixt booke and foureſcore and 8. chapter, writeth the ſame to be vſed with the Dacis and Dalmatians: and alſo Dioſcorides affirmeth the ſame generallie (in his ſixt booke and 20. chapter) to be vſed of the Barbarians. Neither ſhall it anie thing preuaile, if they alleadge, that lead being purged from his groſeneſſe in melting, after will not receiue into it ſelfe anie contrarie qualitie: for nature teacheth, and experience proueth that all mettals are purged by the fire, and are clenſed therewith from their droſſie earth, or vncleane ſuſphure, and ſo thereby their ſubſtance becommeth farre more purer, and by this ſame meanes are mettals prepared, as copper, tinne, and iron it ſelfe, which through heate of the fire being melted, the filth and feces are purged and ſettle to the bottome, and that which remayneth cleane & pure is called ſteele as Ariſt. teſtifieth. 4. Met. cap. 6. And although it be proper to theſe vnperfect mettals in melting to cleanſe them ſelues of their droſſe and groſſe ſubſtance (as it is ſayd before) neuertheleſſe they may imbibe into themſelues a contrarie: for who doubteth but that ſteele (which is inferior to none in hardneſſe) is oftentimes tempered with annoſt a contrarie qualitie or ſubſtance: who would iudge vineger, ſoote, ſalt, the water of earthwormes and mouſeare, mixed with the iuice of radiſhrootes, to be of

an Iron ſubſtance, for Iron being often quenched in that iuice becommeth ſo hard, that ſcarſely any man, hauing not made proofe thereof, would credite it: and on the contrarie part, it is made ſoft by often quenching thereof in the iuice of Hemlocke, ſope, and holthocke, the which alſo commeth to paſſe in tinne and leade, which being often melted and quenched in the iuice of ye ſea Onion, the one loſeth his crackling, the other is purged of his blackneſſe and tenderneſſe, which could not come to paſſe, except they did retaine ſome part of the ſpirit and vertue wherewith they are tempered. It is manifeſt therefore, that the mettals, although they be purged by the fire, may receiue eaſily ye ſubſtance & nature of other things: and meere folly it were to thinke but that a farre more eaſier mixture may be made of mettaline ſpirits, being as it were of one kinde, for we ſee Copper to bee dyed and waxe yeallowe with the ſpirit of Calemine and Tutiae, and againe to be white with the ſpirits of Arſnick, Auripigment and ſuch other, whereby it may iuſtly be concluded, if that mettals and eſpecially lead (whereof ſhot is commonly made) doth receiue a ſpirituall ſubſtance naturally of things which are of the owne kinde, of the which is made diuers mercuriall ſtincking and deadly waters, by adding to it the iuice of Libards bane▪ of the ſea Onion, of the Ewe tree, of the herbe Crowfoote, and alſo of the poiſon of venemous beaſtes, the which by the contrarietie of their natures to ours, doe deſtroy the ſubſtance of our bodies: and by ſuch venemous mixtures, I ſay, the ſhot is ſo poiſoned, that by the onely paſſing through, it leaueth behind it plaine and manifeſt tokens of his poiſon, and that not without great daunger, if not with ſpeedie remedie it be redreſſed. For we ſee alſo by dayly experience, ſuch venemous compoſitions, that if onely the heade of an Arrow be tempered therewith, and wounding a perſon, with drawing of blood, and the Arrow ſticke not, but preſently paſſeth away, yet is the poiſon ſo ſubtile and venemous that by little & little creeping from the ſmaller vaines to the greater, and ſo to the principall parts, the wounded man preſently dieth. the which I haue declared, partly becauſe it was my chance often to ſee the like, (and not onely I but alſo other worthy Phiſitions, whoſe names for breuitie I let paſſe) partly that I might bring to light theſe wonderfull and prodigious effectes, which are wont to happen in this caſe: and that they might not be thought impoſſible, becauſe they are knowne of a fewe, as more at large I meane to

declare in that booke de Antidotis, which I haue in hand, and doo meane (God willing) ſhortly to publiſh, wherein I will reueale both true and meete remedies againſt ſuch poiſons: and therefore let no man doubt but that the wound may be poiſoned, through the venime of the ſhot, whether it be of leade or of any other mettall, although ſome will ſay the contrarie, becauſe it was neuer their chance to be conuerſant with worthy and ſkilfull men, neither haue obſerued the ſundrie and myraculous effectes of nature (vnknowne witho
                     •
                  t doubt) to antiquitie. But that we may returne againe to our purpoſe, we conclude that the ſhot may be poiſoned, not by powring of it in a hole made of purpoſe, as ſome would haue it, but by often dipping and quenching them in mercuriall waters and deadly iuices, through ye which their ſubſtance may be altered & ſpoiled, and ſo they doo venime and infect the wound with their euill diſpoſition, although they ſtay not in the wounde, but preſently paſſe through: of ſuch force is the ſubtiltie of them, as by experience often made in beaſts, hath ben often prooued, the which we meane to confirme with probable reaſons in that booke de Antidotis, of which we ſpake off a little before. But yet we graunt that the ſhot paſſing ſo ſwiftly through the body, cannot ſo ſodenly infect with his poiſon: yet often it commeth to paſſe that the bullet lieth long in the wound vnknowne to the Chyrurgion: and ſo I thinke there is no man that doubteth, but that in ſuch ſpace it hath time enough to infect with his venime the hurted part, for the more ſubtiller and ſpirituall the poiſon is (as we haue declared before) ſo much ſwifter & quicker are the effects thereof, by ſpreading abroade his maligne vapours, through the vaines, arteries and ſinewes, whereby it doth infect the ſpirits naturall, vitall, and animall: choaking them with a certaine diſagreeance and contrarietie, ioyning themſelues with them, whereby the life of man is extinguiſhed, the which doth conſiſt of a liuely and meete action of the ſaide three ſpirits. And theſe poiſons, the more ſubtiler and finer they be, ſo much the more daungerous they are, the which is plainly to be ſeene by the biting of Vipers and other ven
                     •
                  mous waſtes. But if any man will frowardly contend (as I ſee ſome will) that the ſtrength of the fire will take away all the poiſon of the bullet, I will anſwere them with the ſame argument which they themſelues are wont to vſe: for ſay they, theſe wounds are not any thing burnt at all, in that the ſhot (by reaſon of his hardneſſe) is neuer ſo hot, but that it may be

handled with bare hands: and likewiſe I ſay, that then the fire cannot haue ſuch power that it is able to aboliſh the poiſon which is ſpred through the ſubſtance of the bullet, ſpecially when the venime is ſo mixed with all parts of the ſhot, that it hath infected with his venime all the ſubſtance thereof. Neither am I mooued in that Ariſtotle lib. de Coelo cap. 7. writeth, that by the impulſion of the aire, the dartes or arrowes waxe ſo hot that the leade thereof melteth, the which by the thing it ſelfe and dayly experience is knowne to be falſe, and eſpecially in gun bullets, which are ſent out by fire, and are carried away farre more ſwifter then any arrowe: but if this might be graunted to Ariſtotle, yet the witneſſe of auncient writers (of whom mention before is made) doth plainly proue that the poiſon therby, cannot by any means be extinguiſhed: much leſſe thē can it be ouercome with a far leſſer heate. Nay, I ſay, that not onely, that the venime cannot be taken away with ſo ſmal heate, but alſo I affirme, that if the bullet it ſelf ſhould be molten, yet very hardly thereby the poiſon would be purified, for ſo greatly & deeply is it ſpred & mingled wt the whole ſubſtāce therof, that for the moſt part there is not one part left vnaltered. Likewiſe the ſpirite of Arſnicke, Calaminae or Tuthiae, being mingled with gray or yellowiſh Copper, dooth not at the firſt melting vaniſh away, yet we count not thoſe like to them which wee ſpake off before, ſuch as be deadly, being only outwardly & farre from the principall parts applied, through their hid and ſecret qualitie, as the effectes thereof doth moſt plainly declace, By this we truſt, it is manifeſtly prooued that ſhot may be poyſoned, which verie quickly will worke hys effectes, eſpecially if it ſtay in the wound: as oftentimes we haue ſeene, that poyſon being heated with a ſmall fire and ſcarſly made warme, would very hardly be quenched or taken away. By which reaſons it may be concluded yt ſhot may be venemous, but not thorow the pouder (which we haue proued to be quite voyd of venom) but by dipping and ſeaſoning the ſhot in poyſon, which oftentimes we haue ſeene, wherefore it behoueth a wiſe and expert phiſit

                  nomous or no, hauing a more fitter place therefore, in the chapter of the true and orderly curation thereof. This place requireth that we reaſon of the varietie which is found in ſuch woundes, that is, of the burning, which ſometimes is, and ſometimes is not, and to ſay my minde therein, I cannot allow their opinion (moued thereunto by the authoritie of diuers learned men) which write that the cauſe of the burning and blaſting comes through the ſhot, which they th

Of this I will not with manie wordes contend, inſomuch that the nature of the ſhot being wiſely waied (which is commonly of lead, and therefore can hardly abide ſuch force of heate without melting) their error with ſmall ado
                     •
                   is conuinced, and ſo muche the eaſier, beeing alreadie confuted by manie learned reaſons of Laurentius Loubertus, a moſt excellent phiſition, and famous in our countrey, whoſe wiſe and learned iudgement (I doubt not) wil alſo verifie with me, that this blaſting of the wound, is not through the heate of the ſhot, which comes farre of, out of an Iron peece, But it may be when one is wounded by ſhot ſtanding hard by, asdayly we ſee doe happen, that they ſtand ſo nigh the peece, that with the wound, their garmentes & verie beard are alſo ſcorched, which happeneth onely through the burning of the powder, which firie and burning with the ſhot flieth out of the mouth of the gunne: which if anie man ſaith it cannot flee farre, I will anſwere hym by the contrarie that it may verie well flie ſo farre, that if anie man touch his bodie he may plainely feele it, before it be quite extinguiſhed: And againe if anie more captious will demaund, whether that the harneſſe and apparell be not ſufficient to defend the fleſhe from burning by the powder, I doubt not but the harneſſe hath much more force in defending thereof, then hath a doublet made of a beaſtes ſkinne or ſuch other kinde of apparell, the which with the verie ſhirt oftentimes wee haue ſeene by ſhot burned, neyther then is it to be doubted, but that the aire beeing on fire, following

and driuing the pellet into the wounded perſon, but thereby the fleſh may alſo be burned: But what will they ſay then, when the gunne is diſcharged euen cloſe at the part

Surely I denie not, but when one is wounded ſo nigh the Ordinance, but that the wound may be burned and blaſted, in which caſe, they are greatly deceaued, which thinke that ſuch woundes are alwaies without blaſting, and doe iudge the heate to come onely of the pellet, and therby do make rules ſo general, that they may haue many exceptions, which eaſily may be gathered by that which we before haue ſpoken, intreating of the venome and blaſting happening to theſe woundes, Thus much haue I thought it good to declare vnto you concerning the nature & eſſence of wounds by ſhot, and of the ſundrie accidentes which may happen thereunto: the which for the moſt part, are woont to be, ſolution of continuitie with bruſing and rending of the partes, which requireth two intentions curatiue, that is conſolidation, and reſtoring of the bruſed and torne partes, but if it be accompanied with burning (as it may be) then muſt we repaire to the third intention, that is to the extinguiſhing of the fire, and drawing out of the heate, yea and laſt of all to the fourth, that is to ſome wholeſome remedie named of the Greekes Alexipharmacon, as often as we ſhall thinke that there is ſome venom in the wound, hauing ſpeciall regard to the moſte dangerous diſcommodities, and to finde out ſo manie curatiue, and conſeruatiue, and preſeruatiue intentions, as ſundrie woundes ioyned with ſundrie accidentes ſhall require.

                  nd vnlike kinde of ſhot, or to the nighneſſe or farre diſtance thereof, or according to the ſtate of the bodie being hurted, that is eyther naked or couered, yea ſometimes ſo ſafe it is defended with ſo ſure a corſlet (and as we may ſay) ſo tēpered that it cannot be pearred, neyther the bodie by anie meanes be wounded: And if it bee wounded it is verie little and without danger, in that the violence of the ſhot is weakened by the hardneſſe and ſtrongneſſe of the armour, and eſpeciallie being the ſhot of no great ordinance, but of ſome ſmall peece, and all theſe differences (without doubt) may be referred to one kinde, that is, to the ſolution of continuitie, which ſometime is ſeene and ſomtimes is hidden, that is manifeſt, which is perceiued by handling and ſight, and when a plaine wound appeareth with wanneſſe of the fleſhe (as it were an Eſcare) ioyned with great dolor, and ſpecially when the ſinewes are hurt which doth plainly ſhew vnto vs, beſide the ſignes of a wound (which doth not a litle auaile to this purpoſe) that the ſame is made by gunſhot. A hidden or ſecret wound is, without anie manifeſt breaking of the ſkinne, which the Grecians call 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   and is knowen by ſhedding of the bloud betweene the fleſh and the ſkinne, and doe ſtayne the hurted part with a violet and wannie colour. Theſe are the common ſignes of ſuch woundes, wherein a conſideration is had of onely bruſing and ſolution of continuitie, but inſomuch as we haue taught in the former chapter, that ſuch woundes may ſometimes be accompanied with venom and blaſtin
                     •
                  , contrarie to the opinion of

ſome, it behoueth the Chirurgion to imploy all his ſtudie and labour in this caſe, to iudge and diſcerne euerie affection by the tokens and ſignes proper thereunto, becauſe ſuch affections (as we ſaid before) be often ioyned to ſuch woundes, and let him ſeeke out a proper remedie for ech of them, and diligently conſider, which of them is moſt dangerous, for that (as Galen teacheth) is not onely firſt, but alſo chiefeſt to be cured: that inſomuch, as ſometimes wee are compelled by reaſon thereof not onely to let paſſe the other accidentes, but alſo to make new, that thereby we may remedie that which is moſt dangerous. And this is the very cauſe, why the knowledge of theſe wounds poiſoned by ſhot are ſo neceſſarie (as in the Chapter before we haue taught) leaſt that the ſodaine death which many times comes thereby, be imputed to the corruption of the aire and other firſt qualities: when commonly the fault lieth in the wilfulneſſe and vnſkilfulneſſe of the Phiſition, perſwading themſelues that theſe wounds by no meanes may be venemous, & therby they refuſe the true kinde of healing: And ſome no doubt, will attribute it to the aboundance of blood, and to the euill iuice of the bodies called by ye Greeks Cachochimia, the which two verily I doe acknowledge, & with Galen confeſſe, haue great force in hindering of al wounds, and the chiefeſt cauſes of euill accidences, notwe
                  ſtanding if the ſignes, which ſignifieth venom, hath in thē any thing cōmon, with theſe yt happen to gunſhot, where only cōtuſion is ioyned yet may they eaſily be diſcerned, whether they be great or litle or waightie & fearefull accidents and extraordinarie, which oftentimes Signes of poiſon gathered togither. come to paſſe. Therefore if the fleſh be more wanner then it is wont to be in common wounds by ſhotte, and as it were deade, with an euill colour of all the whole member, with intolorable and extraordinarie aches, and alſo with inflamation and pricking and ſhooting paines, eſpecially about the wound, with vnluſtineſſe and heauineſſe of all the whole bodie, and many times burning feuers, with ſounding and alienation of the minde: all theſe doo teſtifie that there is ſome venemous qualitie ioyned with the wound, & eſpecially when there can no manifeſt cauſe be found out by ye Phiſition, whereof all theſe euill accidents ſhould proceede, which ſometimes I haue ſeene to happen in ſimple wounds, yea without the tearing of any ſinewes. But more certainer ſignes of this matter may be if any tokens appeare outwardly, which may bee learned at the mouth of the patient, and by relation of his familiar friendes and

companions: conſidering alſo the manner, the place, and the perſon being wounded. But the ſureſt ſigne of all is learned by the bullet, if it may be found, for if you cut him in two parts, you ſhall ſee him darke and mixed with a purple and violet colour, vnlike to the colour of other ſhot being cut, which is wont to haue a yealow colour. Then maiſt thou ſurely affirme that the ſhot was poiſoned, whereby the very ſubſtance thereof was altered, as plaincly is ſeene by his inward colour, which is greatly altered, wanne and darke (as we ſaid before.) Proofe thereof alſo may be made in the fire, which was ſaid (not raſhly) to haue great force in purging of all poiſon. Becauſe ſuch things which are ſtrong poiſon in deede, doe conſiſt of a ſpirituall and ayriall ſubſtance, and therefore by force of fire doe eaſily vaniſh into the aire, yet not with a ſmal heate ſuch as is felt in going out of ye ſhot, as Ambroſius Pareus thought, which rather in proceſſe of time woulde fixe it and make it not volatle, and ſo conſequently vnhurtfull. But by a moſt ſtrong heate of fire, ſuch as they vſe in ſubliming, for in that force of fire, ye mercurie is eleuated and vaniſhed away: ſo likewiſe is the Arſnicke & orpigment, and ſuch other ſpirits, and for that cauſe they cannot be purged, except they be preſſed in the cold necke of the ſubliming veſſels: and ſo the ſuſpected bullet being melted and kept in great heate a ſufficient time, then a darke and ſtinking ſmoke ariſeth, couering the mettall (of which ſmoke or fume you muſt heware) which after the melting is found not onely vnpurged, but alſo appeareth blacke, wanne, and darke, which commeth through the venemous fume, ſpreding it ſelfe about the mettall, and this is an infallible ſigne that the ſhott was poyſoned, whereby the wound may be venomed (as I ſaid before) and that according to the time, as it remaineth in the wound. Theſe be the ſignes whereby a poyſoned wound is knowne, which are the more dangerous to be iudged, the more they doe weaken the ſtrength of the patient: Likewiſe, bliſtering, Signes of Aduſtion gathered together. bladdering, pricking paine, drineſſe, contraction, and hardneſſe of the ſkinne, doth manifeſtly ſhewe that the wound is alſo burnt with powder, the which may be learned more ſurely by relation of the wounded perſon, which can commonly declare whether he ware wounded, nigh or farre off, which alſo may be gathered by the burning of the veſture: and it behoueth the Phiſition to take heede diligently of all theſe thinges, becauſe they are of great waight and may bring great hurt to the wound, and hinder

greatly the curation thereof: and through aboundance of fiures and other grieuous accidents, which commonly inſue, vnleſſe timely with wholeſome medicines they be preuented, as Galen commandeth in 4. Met. cap. 5. where he teacheth the maner of curing of an vlcer (ioyned or coupled with another griefe) not as the curation of a ſimple vlcer: but firſt that affection muſt be remoued, and then the vlcer to be cured.
               
                  Of the iudgement.
                  Furthermore a ſounder iudgement in this caſe may be giuen by a heedie conſideration of the ſaying of Galen written in his method where he teacheth that diſeaſes may be dangerous, for three cauſes: firſt by reaſon of the worthineſſe of the part affected, ſecondarily through the vehemencie and ſtrength of the griefe, laſtly by the malignitie and euill qualitie of the diſeaſe: Therefore if the ſpirituall parts, or if the braine, and eſpecially the ſubſtance thereof be wounded it is deadly: Likewiſe the lunges, the midriffe, the ſtomacke, the ſplene, and kidnie being wounded, doth cōmonly bring death, for they alſo by reaſon of their offices are reckoned among the principall partes: of no leſſe ieopardie are the wounds of the guts, eſpecially in the ſmaller, where there is no fleſhe: alſo in the bladder, which cannot be aglutinated, becauſe they are vnbloudie parts: and likewiſe woundes wherein the head or ſtomacke is pearced through, are counted verie dangerous, and the more greater and deeper ye wounds be with tearing of the ſinewes and bruſing of the bones, ſo much the more dangerous they are: and eſpeciallie thoſe which happen in the head with fracture of Cranion, and alſo ſuche as be nigh the ioyntes, through great and vehement accidentes inſuing hereon, but woundes ioyned with venome, although in ſhew they be but ſmall, yet are they moſte dangerous, becauſe by the contrarie ſubſtance & exceſſiue qualitie thereof, not onely the naturall diſpoſition, but alſo the verie ſubſtance of the bodie, is altered and changed, and eſpecially when the wound is with breaking of the ſkinne, which by thickneſſe thereof doth defend the fleſh (which otherwiſe it woulde, ſo that the poyſon be not ſubtill) that the contagiouſneſſe thereof doth not infect the bloud, ſpirites and humors, and conſequently the principall partes, whereby death commonly inſueth. Moreouer all theſe woundes are to be counted the more

dangerous, in caſe they be accompanied with euill accidentes and great paſſions, and alſo the paſſion filled with euill humours: and ſo much the more if at that time anie common ſickneſſe doth raigne in the campe cauſed by the aire, whoſe qualitie although it be ſimple: and not ſubiect to putrifaction, yet oftentimes it bringeth great alteration to the qualities, being infected with noyſome and ſtincking fumes, which oftentimes comes to paſſe in great hoſtes, and chiefly in that part which is moleſted with compoſts, and dead carcaſes of beaſtes and men: from whence ariſe the noyſome & ſtincking fumes, whereby the ſouldiers are afflicted: alſo vnſtableneſſe of the weather comming with tempeſtes, doth greatly hurt theſe woundes, and oftentimes put the partie in great hazard, and chiefly when a drie winter goeth before with northen blaſtes, and a wet ſpring inſueth with ſoutherly windes, through which many groſſe humours are ingendred, which with that vnſtableneſſe of weather, are ſtirred and corrupted: and the euileneſſe of the aire ioyning therewith, bringeth forth peſtilent and burning feuers, with inflamacions, Gangrena and mortification, yea and at the laſt, death it ſelfe, as Hipoc. witneſſeth in the third Aphoriſme in lib. Epid. Neyther may we ouerpaſſe the looſe and vnorderly kinde of dyet vſed 
                        Hip. lib. Epid. Aphor. 3. not onely among the common ſouldiers, but alſo with the Captaines, rulers, legates and protectors. Which oftentimes are inforced to take ſuch foode as comes to hand, eyther hote or cold, raw or ſodde, good or bad, yea ſometimes, pulſe, fruites and berries: and to drinke ſtincking waters, new, ſower and dead wines. Contrarie to the vſage and nature of diuers, through which they are infected. And through ſuch vnorderly kind of dyer, hurtfull & common diſeaſes are wo
                        •
                     nt to ariſe in the campes, verie dangerous to the wounded, and that thereby the bloud is annoyed, and the humours infected: and ſo the euileneſſe of the wound is increaſed, and ſundrie accidentes doe inſue. And on the contrarie part, ſuche woundes are to be iudged leſſe dangerous and more cur able, which are accompanied with fewe paſſions, and are farre from the ſpirituall and prin
                        •
                     ipall partes, and are without venome, tearing of the ſinewes, and fracture of the bones. And whenſoeuer the Phiſition doth iudge the wound to be mortall, yet I would not haue the patient ſtraite to be forſaken as a dead man, but to applie the beſt medioines, for manie times nature holpen by Arte doth worke miracles, whereby the Emperickes (to the great infamie of Phiſicke)

doth oftentimes purchaſe great fame and glorie. For being bold on the ſtrength of nature, they take in hand deſperate cures forſaken, as dead men by the Phiſitians, and get thereby to themſelues great credite, and to the Phiſitions no leſſe ſhame, as by heareſay a two yeares paſt happened to a noble Prouinciall named

                        , was by ſhot pearced through and forſaken of the Phiſitions, who iudged the ſubſtance of his liuer to be periſhed, and yet was cured by ſome of his noble friendes, with medicines of no great price, The which rare euent may be a notable e

               CHAP. III. The order of curing the aforeſaid wounds.
               THe curation of ſuch wounds, doth conſiſt of two generall intentions, and one particular, the two generall are an orderly kind of dyet, and an expulſion of humors, the other by an apt application of inedicines. And that we may keepe an orderly and methodicall kinde of teaching, firſt of all wee will intreate of the order of dyet, which is conuenient for ſuch wounded perſons, the obſeruat
                     •
                   on whereof is knowne to bring great commoditie to the ſicke and wounded.
               And ſuch a kinde of dyet is to be preſcribed to the hurted, as is The order of dyet. woont to be ordained in other diſeaſes, that is, a meſurable obſeruation of the ſixe things not naturall, but a more particular conſideration is taken, by the ſeaſon of the yeare, by the nature, ſtrength, and diſpoſition of the partie: and by his accuſtomable vſe in eating and drinking, as Hipoc. doth plentifully declare in lib. de vict. ratione in morbis acutis. For one kinde of diet is meete for chronicall and dayly griefes, and another for ſharpe and vehement ſickeneſſes: and that alſo variable according to the beginning, ſtate, and decreaſing of the diſeaſe. And let no man doubt but that alſo the diſpoſition of the Region, and nature of the ſeaſon of the yeare, may alter the dyet, in that ſome regions are hotte and ſome colde, and

ſome ſeaſons who
                     •
                   ſome moiſt and rainy, and among all, the nature and temperament of the wounded is diligently to be obſerued, in ſo much, as the bodies being full of euill iuices, the larger their dyet is, the more hurtfull it is to them. The ſtrength alſo of the partie is to be wayed, and according to that we muſt not onely preſcribe a dyet, but alſo thereunto apply the miniſtration of all our medicines. As concerning cuſtome, there is none but hath great reſpect thereof, in that ſuddaine alterations are ſo much the more daungerous, as they ſhall digreſſe from the dayly cuſtome and vſe of ye ſick, as Hipoc. teacheth in lib. de vict. ration. in morbis acutis: and reaſon it ſelfe ſheweth, for if any man ſhould preſcribe a generall ſtraite order of dyet to all alike, which by ſhot are wounded, (without any conſideration of the thing aforeſaide, as commonly they doo) neglecting qu
                     ••
                  e their dayly dyet, when ſome there bee, which make three or foure meales a day, yea almoſt euery houre: othe
                     •
                  s there bee, which in their ſickneſſe may not (without great hinderance) forbeare wine, to whome if wee ſhould commaunde a ſtraite dyet, it would ſtraight fal out as Hippoc. in the foreſaid place cōcludeth: where writing of thoſe which make three or four meales a day, if they loſt but one, they are weakened: and contrariwiſe ſuch as are wont to keepe a ſlender dyet, if they eate and drinke more then ordinarie, or out of ſeaſon, are incontinent agreeued: and therefore according to the minde of that worthy man, we muſt indeuour our ſelues, to preſcribe ſuch a dyet to our patient, as he was moſt accuſtomed to in his health: and let it be holden, that nature is chiefly comforced with ſuch thinges as he is dayly and by familiar cuſtome vſed vnto, and are farre more holeſome, better, and healthier (although it ſeemeth contra
                     •
                  ie to our intentions) then ſuch as for the patients health are deuiſed ſtrange and vnwonted, becauſe by their ſudden mutation, they contrarie nature: and indeede this is the cauſe why the learned Phiſitions of Germany doo iudge, that the vſed and dayly dyet is to be retained, and doo permit their wounded perſons to drinke wine, which otherwiſe would thinke themſelues vndone, in that the vſe of waters is ſo daungerous to them. The which I haue ſeene vſed, not onely in France, but alſo (and that with better ſucceſſe) in Germany, where the wine for the moſt part is more wateriſh and thinner, then in France. The which I haue not ſpoken: as though I would haue no other kinde of dyet preſcribed to the wounded, then ſuch as they were accuſtomed to in their

health: neither am I ſo vnſ

                     •
                  rurgions, that they preſcribe not ſo ſtraite a dyet as they are wont commonly to doo, and that they ſhould keepe a meaſure both in y• qualitie & quantitie of meate and drinke, as the ſtate of the diſeaſe ſhall require: for in the ſtate of the ſickneſſe (for auoyding of inflamations and aches) a ſlender dyet is to bee kept, as is taught by Hipoc lib. de vict. rat. in morb. acut. Aphori. 10. Moreouer, the dyet is to be preſcribed as the time of the yeare requireth, for the ſtomackes of ſome are whot, others cold, & ſo be apt to digeſt, and are to be conſidered according to the tēperamēt of the patient, for (as Galen teacheth) ſome things are allowed to Phlegmatike, which muſt be retained from the ſanguine & Cholerike: & as we ſaid before, cōſideration muſt be had of the age, ſtrength, and diſpoſition: and in the very beginning of the ſicknes ſo ſtraite a dyet is not to be kept, but by lit
                     •
                  e and litle it muſt be deminiſhed vntil the end of the ſtate of ye diſeaſe, but ſo as ye ſtrength of the patient may ſuffer it, which thing muſt be warely obſerued, And ſo theſe things rightly conſidered, we muſt come to the adminiſtration of the things not naturall, and ſo ſatiſfie our intent.
               After this it behooueth to chooſe a drie and temperate aire: for Of the aire. ſuch is required of all wounds, becauſe by exiccation they are conglutinated: but and if any man obiect, that it lieth not in our power, to bring a drie aire to the ſicke, when as there is not any thing to bee founde, more moiſter (as Ariſtotle teacheth in the ſeconde chapter of his Meteors) in ſo much it exceedeth the water in moiſture, which in ſight ſeemeth moiſter, in that it moiſtneth things dipped therem, which the aire cannot doo by reaſon of the ſubtilneſſe therof. This may eaſily be anſwered, that ſuch aire may be choſen, and by art corrected, and ſo made meeter to our purpoſe & intent: for it is not vnknowne, but that ſome places and houſes are whotter, dryer, moiſter, and colder then others be, for thoſe which be nigher the North are colde, and ſuch as are Sowtherly are whot, euen as the ſunne is nearer or farther from them. Alſo the ſituation of the country is to be conſidered, for ſome are hilly, ſome marriſh, others adioyning nigh to lakes, ſtanding pooles and riuers: by the varietie whereof, the qualitie of the aire is changed and altered. Who is ignorant but that the nature of the men of Aſia is farre differing from thoſe of Europe, the which Hipoc. lib. De aere Locis etaquis) doth attribute to the change & varietie of

times, which cauſeth the nature of countries to be more rougher and harder. and that is the cauſe that countrie and ſea-coaſtes men be of an vnlike nature and diſpoſition to thoſe which are bredde in cities and vallies farre from the ſea-coaſts. What ſhal we ſay now of the ſituation of the cittie of Ferraria, or Florence, of the which in the firſt, all wounds in the head are deadly, in the other al the hurts of the legges are vncurable, for which cauſe Hippocrates, treating of this matter, ſaith that the nature of the ſouth wind is altered, by reaſon of the countries, by which it is carried, which are ſome hotter, ſome colder then ſome: for hee writeth that firſt it comes from cold and Iſie countries (whereof winds are ingendred, as Ariſtot. in the ſecond of his Meteors ſheweth, and that they are of the ſame nature at the firſt, as the Northwinds are, which are froſtie and colde: as thoſe which inhabite, theſe countries doo feele:) And after being carried by the South, and beames of the ſunne waxeth ſo hot, that through the heate thereof, it looſeth his coldneſſe, and burneth the herbes, and makes the inhabiters thereof to be dry, and ſo paſſing ouer the ſeas, and imbibbing the moiſture thereof, it looſeth the great dryneſſe it had receiued, and becomes moiſte, as is ſeene and perceiued in all Italy, and alſo in that part of Fraunce, which is named Occitania. And this is the reaſon why wee iudge the South-winde to bee hurtfull to woundes: becauſe that this moiſture is ioyned with heate, which is the mother of putrifaction, as wee haue before prooued. The like may bee ſaide of the North-winde, which in ſundrie regions is verie wholſome: and withſtandeth putrifaction: and againe in ſome very unwholſome: inſomuch that the peſtilence or anie other diſeaſe raigning) is thereby increaſed. the cauſe whereof (as we ſayd before) is to be attributed to the varietie of countries: and ſituation of Cities, being in low and marriſh places, wherebyth e proper nature of the windes may be altered: and ſo the bodies of men are corrupted and filled with all humours. Theſe thinges waied, and the ſeaſon of the yeare conſidered, (which are diuers, and vnlike by reaſons before alleadged) and ſundrie mutations, which dayly happen and alter the qualitie of the aire, as Hippocrates hath taught, libro de

                     ere, locis & aquis) we muſt chooſe fit and profitable aire, where the wounded perſon may remayne. But inſomuch that, that is hard and vnpoſſible to be done, becauſe the wounded, by bitterneſſe of the griefe can neyther ride nor goe, but commonly are compelled

                  itie next adioyning thereunto, yet ſpecially that place where the campe hath long ſtayed, is aboue all to be ſhunned, becauſe the ayre thereby is infected: and alſo moyſt and marriſh places are to be auoyded, for thence doe noyſome and thicke vapors aſcend. And contrariwiſe ſuch aire is to be choſen, that is farre diſtant from moiſt and wet groundes, for ſuch is pute cleare & wholeſome. And let the windows next the north be open rather then thoſe next the South: but and if that ſhall ſeeme colde, it may be amended by heate of fire made in the chamber, and alſo ſometime corrected with odiferous thinges, as Maſticke, Roſes, Jumper Berries, & ſuch like. And in the ſommer you ſhal vſe lauing of the houſe with Oxicrato, and ſtrew the chamber with ruſhes and greene herbes and leaues of the wythie, or vine tree, and after this order may the aire be applied and corrected to the health of the patient, as the part hurted ſhall require. For woundes and hurtes of the head or cōmiſſures thereof cannot ſuffer ſo cold an ayre (by reaſon of the nipping thereof) as woundes in other places may. And as concerning his diet, it is no doubt, but it muſt be ordered according to the maner Of meate and drinke. of the hurt (as Hippocrates hath taught, and as the nature of the patient is able to abide, auoyding ſodaine changes, for ſuch (as we ſaid before) are verie dangerous, let his meate be ſuch as breedeth good iuice, and the quantitie thereof the leſſe, eſpecially vntill the ſtate of the diſeaſe be paſt: in which time a more ſlenderer dyet muſt be kept then afterward: and let the bread be well leauened, and throughly baked. And let him vſe the fleſhe of ſmall birdes, as thruſhes or ſuch like, eating therewith the iuice of an Oringe or Lemon or Greeneſauce made of Sorrell, to get him a ſtomacke: Alſo bread-broath, which is made of bread, and a chicken firſt boyled with bugloſe, ſorrel, lettice & ſuch kind of hearbs: and this broath he may vſe in ye morning to mollifie his belly: & raiſons of the ſun, and prunes in this caſe be very wholſome: ſo are likewiſe Damaſcenes, Grapes condit, Barly picked and ſodden, Almond milke and Oten milke: all theſe are very wholſome, and chiefely in the beginning, for then the wounded commonly refuſe all meates ſauing broathes, and ſuch as are liquide.

and all other meates are wholſome, which are ſweete, delicate, of good iuice and light of digeſtion. The poorer ſort may eate broath made of Mutten and Veale, and of a Chicken if they be able, boiled with raiſins and prunes, or ſuch like, as their ability will extende: and let them forbeare groſſe meats of euill iuice and hard of digeſtion, and all water fowles, and beaſts: and eſpecially pigge fleſh, and ſalt meates, and others that be ſharpe: and all kinde of ſpices, & let them drink Priſan, & Hipoc. water, and ſuch as are ſanguine or cholericke may vſe onely water filtred and boiled: let others (eſpecially ſuch as before were not vſed to drinke wine delaide with water) haue thinne Claret delayd with water, and that in the beginning, if ſo be y• there be no feuer or inflamation: and as concerning labour or reſt, let this Italian prouerbe followed, La gamba al'letto, & la man al pecto, with the aduiſe of Hipoc. lib. de vlcer. which ſaith, that reſt is verie meete for all wounded perſons, and labour hurtfull: and therefore the Phiſitions doo very fooliſhly in in commanding exerciſe of bodie to them that haue neede of ſuche reſt and quietneſſe, that oftentimes they cannot moue themſelues for paine: but in ſteede of exerciſe they may vſe frication, on the whole partes and contrarie ſide: and then they ſhall doe the office of medicine hauing vertue of keeping backe, and ſhall turne aſide the fluxes of humours comming to the affected member, and alſo drie vp ſuperfluous moiſtures ingendred by reſt, as Hipocrates hath taught lib. de Diaeta. And as for ſleepe, let it be granted when nature ſeemeth to require it, for ſleepe (in all diſeaſes) is verie neceſſarie to concoction, and doth reuiue ye ſtrength loſt and deca

Moreouer all vexations of the minde are verie hurtfull, and eſpecially anger, which troubleth the ſtomacke, and cauſeth the humors to be more thinner and ſubtiller, whereby more aboundance of fluxis comes to the affected part, and manie other euill paſſions and accidentes.

               CHAP. IIII. Of the ſecond intention, that is of purging and euacuation of humors by bloodletting and purgation.
               NOt raſhly and without great cauſe, did Galen in his Method call to remembrance, and highly commend this noble ſaying 
                     Met. 4. cap. 6. of Hipp. Medicum opportere non modo naturae imitatorem eſſe, verum etiam eoru mque cum ſua ſponte eueniunt, conferunt. For it is y• office of the Phiſition to ſupplie the wants of nature, and to preuent ſuch hurtfull accidentes, as may happen thereunto, and that by indications taken of the waightineſſe of the griefe, the which I find to be two, that is bloudletting and purgation, both of the which are very neceſſarie to the curing of wounds by ſhot: which for three cauſes may iuſtly be reckoned among moſt dangerous: and therefore it is verie neceſſarie to drawe bloud in the curation of theſe woundes, & that in the verie beginning, that ſo thereby the fluxe of humours in the wounded part, be ſtayd, and impoſtumation kept backe: neither muſt we ſtay for the digeſtion of the wound, and deferre it till the beginning and ſtate thereof be paſt, as Auicen thought, whoſe opinion is not onely againſt all reaſon, but alſo contrarie to the authoritie of Hipocrates, who teacheth, that if any thing is to be moued, it muſt be done in the verie beginning, Moreouer this bloudletting muſt be done in ye contrarie or oppoſit part & then eſpecially, when it is not doubted that the ſhot was venomous: which if it ſhould be, then is reuulſion forbidden, for the venome is to be drawen out by ſcarification of the wound it ſelfe, or a little belowe and partes about it, taking heede that it creepe not farre (as his nature is) to the noble and principall partes, as more at large we will declare when we intreate of the curation thereof. The fitteſt time for letting of bloud is the morning, except we be forced otherwiſe eyther by ouermuch fluxe of bloud or anie other accident, and before we doe it, it ſhall not be amiſſe to miniſter a gliſter to loſe the belly: and alſo in letting of bloud we muſt not onely weigh the greatneſſe of the wound, but alſo the fulneſſe of the whole body, and according thereunto limit the quantitie of bloud, eyther more or leſſe: neither muſt wee forget to conſider the age of the patient, the time of the yeare, the nature of the place, & diuers other things, which muſt be committed to ye iudgement of the ſkilfull Phiſition, which may wiſely weigh yt which is written by Galen lib.

may preuent that which is to come: and by this meanes wee ſhall not onely bring the wounded part in good temperature, but alſo the whole body in better ſtate. Now then, inſomuch as purgations are neceſſarie in theſe great and dangerous woundes, it behoueth it to be done with great diligence & heede taking: firſt we muſt conſider the ſtate, cuſtome, and age of the patient, alſo the nature of the time and qualitie of the countrey: and ſo in other caſes we muſt ſearche out the humour moſte abounding, and the place affected, whereby we may learne, what humour is to be purged, and how and what way moſt eaſily it will be expelled, & then aboue all let vs chooſe ſuch purgations, as moſt eaſily & ſafely may be miniſtred, for I can ſcarſe allowe the vſe of y• violent ones which were in vſe in Galens and Hipocrates time, becauſe in operation they are verie hote, and thereby doe eaſily breede feuers, and diſturbe the bloud, and ſo bring the wound to inflamation & impoſtumation, of which ſortes are Coloquintida and Elleborus, eſpecially vnprepared, But we may ſafely vſe Caſſia, Manna, Rubarbe, Sene, Polipodie, & Agaricke, but chiefly their extracts, the which more ſafer, & with as much profite may be vſed in theſe greene woundes, as the other may in dayly and vehement vlcers: and becauſe the bellies of ſome by taking a medicine are not looſed by reaſon of the varietie of natures (for ſome are hardily purged, with others a ſmall purgation worketh, and there be, which by onely ſmelling thereunto, are greatly purged) we muſt therefore take heede that wee giue not a ſtrong purgation to our patient, except firſt we haue had proofe of his nature, But and if the ordure be hard and baked in the guttes, and ſo the purgation be hindered, it were neceſſarie firſt to looſe it, with ſome gentle medicine giuen by the mouth, as a bole mad of an ℥. of Caſſia

               CHAP. V. Of the third generall intention curatiue, which is done by Chyrurgerie: and firſt of the manner of the firſt dreſsing.
               VVE ſaid in the beginning, that in wounds by ſhot, two Indications curatiue were to be conſidered, that is ſuppuration, and generation of new fleſh, (which are ſufficient, if we onely regard the contuſion and bruſing thereof, and not the venemous qualitie and burning, which may be ioyned therew
                     •
                  th) the which two intentions, that we may orderly do, and ſo obtaine our pretendid purpoſe, there are eleuen indications to be conſidered of vs, which they call Subalterne, of the which one of them commandeth the ſhot to bee taken out, or ſmall peeces of the coate of maile, or points of weapons ſticking faſt, and alſo peeces of their apparell, ſcales of bones, ſharpe and pricking, clots, or any ſuch other thing which may happen in the wounde, which muſt be taken out, (if it

may be) without paine: and if any thing bee deepe in, it muſt bee wrought with your fingers or pincers, or toothed tenacles, made after the faſhion of a Crowes bill, as you may ſee them pictured in ſundery ſorts, in the booke of Ambroſius Pareus, a moſt ſkilfull Chyrurgion. And the ſhot muſt be taken out the ſame way it went in: placing the wounded perſon (as Hippocrates commandeth) in the ſame ſort as he was in when he receiued the wounde, or at the leaſt ſo placed and laide in his bedde, that ſo nigh as may be, he reſemble the ſame. And the ſhot is commonly taken out by that way, as vy force it was driuen in: becauſe it hath made and prepared it ſelfe a way to come forth thereby: the which paſſage (if neede require) muſt be inlarged with a lancet or inciſion knife, that the bullet may follow the eaſier, and the leſſe inflamation ariſe, if ſo be it be found by a ſearcer ſticking in the fleſh, and hath not pearced any great vaine, or ſinewy place. In which caſe we muſt vſe a new inciſion, with more profite, if the fleſh in the contrary part be verie thinne, and by feeling the ſhot is perceiued, and no manifeſt let, but inciſion may be made in the contrary ſide. And of this the Chyrurgion ought alwayes to haue a ſpeciall care (as ſaith Celſus, writing of drawing out things infixed in wounds) leaſt that a ſinew, great Seuenth book of remedies, Chap. 5. vaine, or artery bee hurted thereby: which if it be like to inſue, or the ſhot be ſo hidde that it cannot be founde, it is better to let it ſtay till ſuch time as nature it ſelfe ſhall expell it. For what ſhall it preuaile, when the wound is great of it ſelfe, to make a newe, and in vaine to moleſt the patient with double paines: in ſo much as in diuers the ſhot hath beene ſo ſecret, that many yeares after ye wound hath bene healed, it hath fallen out of his owne accord, with a ſmall impoſtume.
               Moreouer this thing may be done by applying of drawing medicines, whoſe vſe is dayly, eſpecially if it be ſuſpected the ſhot to be venemous, for in ſuch caſe it muſt be had out with ſpeede: wherefore (leaſt the venime ſtricke vpward, and draw to the principall parts) we muſt preſently vſe the ſtrongeſt drawers, as in other caſes thoſe not ſo forceable, of the which we ſhall haue occaſion to ſpeake, when we intreate of venemous woundes. This firſt intention being done, that is, all things (as much as in vs lieth) taken out of the wound, next we will ſpeake of ſuch medicines as firſt are to be applied to the ſame: in which caſe we finde the iudgement of the Phiſitions and Chyrurgions much to varie, ſome woulde haue a burning

whot iron, or cauſticke, or any other eating medicine to be applied to euery wounde indifferently: others the oyle Oliue, or oyle of Elders to be powred on exceeding whot: ſome commende Treacle, others Turpentine, and ſome woulde haue the oile of whelpes, to be applied verie warme: but the common ſort vſe to take their matches, ſtupes, or tow, and dippe it in vineger, the white of an egge, and ſome aſtringent medicine, and therewith fill the whole wound: and binde and roole therein the parts about it: and that dreſſing they will not to bee remooued for the ſpace of a whole day, as they ſay, for feare of bleeding. But how euill this cō
                  mon vſe is, the ſkilfull may iudge: for theſe emplaſticall medicines are of a thick and earthy ſubſtance, and aſtringent power, which ſuddainly are dried vp, and do pre

But if meere neceſſitie, and want of other medicines, doth inforce the Chyrurgion to vſe theſe common remedies to ſtop the great fluxe of blood (which in theſe wounds is ſeldome ſeene) yet (if they may) let them bee picked out or chaunged, or els often made moiſt with Oxirhodino warmed: neither is it to be forgotten that many now adayes, do vſe to the cure of ſuch wounds (not only at the firſt dreſſing, but vntill they be fully healed) onely running water warmed, and ſome put therevnto vinegar and oyle, and dippe therein their matches and towe, which ſo well falleth out, that diuers thinke that it is done by magicall incantations: the which thing by daily experience is prooued: neither is it againſt reaſon: for Celſus writeth that ſimple cold water is profitable for woundes: Lib. 8. cap. 30. and in another place he ſaith, it is good how euer it be applied: yea warmed, for it eaſeth paine, expelleth inflamations, and putteth backe fluxes, the which accidents (by the conſent of all men) in the very beginning are to be reſiſted. Furthermore by the aduice of

                  Hippoc. all contuſed wounds are to be cured by preſent ſupuration the which is done (as experience and all auncient writers haue taught) by fomentation of warme water. If ſo bee then, water doth repel and driue backe the violētnes of ſuch grieuous and great accidents which commonly come to wounds, why ſhould then any man mauell, if the nature (wherein is contained the efficient cauſe and naturall balme which doth eonglutmate both broken bones, and wounded fleſh) doth ſo incarnate wounds, and ſocicatriſe them, (ſo be it that art giue attendance to nature, and dooth miniſter and ſerue thereunto, in taking heede that the wounde bee not h

                     Ʋinſius cured, of whome we ſpake before, being wounded greeuouſly at the ſiege of Rochell: and not onely he, but diuers others: for theſe thinges being mixed, doe reſiſt all kinde of accidentes, as paine, inflamation, fluxes, and alſo putrifaction: which laſt eſpecially is to be preuented (becauſe theſe kindes of woundes are verie much ſubiect thereunto) leaſt Gangrena and Sphacelus follow after. And it is manifeſt yt vineger withſtandeth corruption, in that it preſerueth thinges co

And ſo much the more I allow the vſe thereof, in that whether it be inwardly miniſtred or outwardly applyed, it ſuppreſſeth the power of venome, which may ſometimes be ioyned with theſe woundes, as we haue taught, and that is the cauſe that I allowe the iudgement of thoſe which cauſe hote oyle preſently to be applied, for it is verie wholeſome, partly becauſe, by relaxation it diſſolueth the inward venome of euill humours, and partly in that it defendeth the hollowneſſe of the wound from the violence of the aire: which thing aboue the reſt is to be heeded. That the wound be not long open, but ſo ſoone as may be, it be couered, and that the aire is altogether ſubiect to putrifaction, it is manifeſt to thoſe, whiche ſet anie kinde of pippins, and ſtoppe the ſame verie cloſe with lut um ſapientiae, as they tearme it, that no aire breake in,

It remaineth nowe to intreate of venome and burning, which two, we haue prooued to happen oftentimes to ſuch wounds. For venome therefore which muſt haue recourſe to a third intention, that is to ſome holeſome medicine (named of the greekes Alexipharmacon) whereby, out of hande it may bee drawne out of the wound, and the ſtrength thereof delayed, leaſt by little and little creeping in, it commeth to tbe principall parts, and ſo altereth their ſubſtance and hindereth their operation: and this is to be done with medicines, partly apylied outwardly to ye wound and heart, and partly inwardly by the mouth miniſtred. For if the fleſh about the wound be more wanner then it is wont to be in common wounds, and as it were deade, with paleneſſe of the whole member, with pricking of the ſides, and extraordinarie inflamations and paine, with debilitie of the whole bodie, alienation of the mind, and burning feuers. And theſe accidents come without any manifeſt cauſe, it plainely declareth the wound to be venomed: and then (all other intentions ſaid aſide▪) preſently wee muſt prouide to withſtand that, for euen as the ſkilful ſhipmaiſter ſeeing a terrible tempeſt ariſing, with bluſtering windes, doth preſently euen againſt both ſtreame and winde (conſidering his ſafegard) with ſayle and oare, ſeeke to finde ſome ſafe porte and place to ſtay in: Euen ſo the Phiſitian harniſed with reaſon, vſe, and experience, ought out of hand to applie ſome healthull medicine to this preſent incommoditie, to boate downe preſently (if it may be) the malice thereof, and that before it taketh roote and hold in the wound, and doth poſſeſſe the principall partes and heart, to which place it maketh great ſpeede, and in this caſe preſent inciſion often fayleth, and that which is done too late neuer helpeth. Therfore if we iudge by the foreſaid ſignes and ſuch like that the wound is poyſoned, we muſt ſtraight haue recourſe to ſome preſent remedie, but firſt a ſound iudgement taken, with perfect prognoſtication (as Celſus willeth) giuen to the friendes of the patient, whether he be eyther

paſt helpe, or in great danger, or like to recouer, leaſt that arte being ouercome with the euill, it be attributed to our ignorance and deceite, to the great diſcredite of the arte, after this, a conuenient order of dyet preſcribed, which reſiſteth venome, wee muſt ſtraight haue reſpect whether the griefe doth require eyther bloudletting or purgation, which are to be done ſpeedily: with good aduiſement, whether the euacuation muſt bee done firſt and foremoſt, or elſe with ſweate, vomite, laſke, and phlebotomy, that the euill humors may be purged▪ before they be ſpred in the vaynes, and taken holde in the arteries, or els the pores (by ſweate) being opened, theſe euill and noyſome vapors, wherewith the heart is oppreſſed, may come forth and vaniſh, which is to be done, eſpecially if the poyſon firſt be ſpred through the body, and the patient filled with ill humors, and then alſo Paulus counſelleth, that euacuation be made by phlebotomye as is to be ſeene in his 5. booke, chap. 2. After this miniſter ſuch thinges as defend and comfort the heart, as Treacle and Methridate, in wine, or decoction of the roots of Angelica, Turmentill, Gentian, Biſtort, Citron ſeedes, Sorrell, hear be baulme, fluelline and pympinell, with the ſirope of lemons, or any other infuſion: and that, as the nature of the partie requireth, and ſhal ſeeme good to the expert Phiſition, and in that caſe it behoueh him to be wiſe and warie, and not miſſe. Moreouer I haue thought it good to ſet downe a receite eaſie to be made, for their ſakes, which are to come, which being miniſtred, expelleth all venome, as by dayly proofe it hath bene tried: and take it for a ſinguler ſecret, although it be familiar.

                  But Galen in his xiii. booke Meth. Med. iudgeth two intentions curatiue to be required in thoſe venomous woundes, the one to draw forth the poyſon, the other to alter the paine comming thereof, The firſt intention is performed, with thinges heating and drawing, as boxing, frications, cauterizatiōs made with hot iron or medicines: The other is done by ſuch medicines, which did, or can alter the qualitie by a contrarie qualitie, as to vſe refrigeratiues, if great heat do

Aetius, Actuarius, and Cornelius Celſus, excellent Phiſitions and worthie of eternall commendations, haue worthily written. Notwithſtanding becauſe they had neyther ye knowledge of wounds made by gunſhot, neyther of any excellent medicine, neyther yet perhaps of the poyſon, wherewith the ſhot may be poiſoned, I haue thought it meete to bring to light moſt profitable medicines, & they not comon, to cure ſuche wounds as are veno

For rather brine or ſalt-water dooth preſently draw on the burning and fire of ſuch wounds, and doo aſwage the great paine, and keepe backe bliſters, if the burned part be preſently couered with a fine cloth wette in ſalt water. But Oribaſius and

Whereunto the Phiſition or Chyrurgion ought ſo much the more to looke by, how much the more the number & greatnes of accidents ſhall increaſe, that he may let nothing paſſe which doth pertain to the perfite

I haue thought it good to ſet out this enſample to the younger Chyrurgions, that thereby they may indeuour themſelues by all meanes rather to preſerue the hurted member, then to beginne their curation by taking it off, which ought not to be done, before it is plainly perceiued the member to be come to mortification, and then let it be done by due warning and prediction: ſome wil obiect, that in the beginning the ſtrength of the pa

Moreouer it is better firſt to die that kinde of curation which is of credite and profite, then to attempt a taking heed of other hanious griefes not yet come: neither may we thinke that nature is ſo weake, but ſhe is able to performe

let it be taken in hand: firſt of all let all things bee taken out which are contuſed and torne, and whatſoeuer oppreſſeth the panicles, but if there bee any great fragment, which oftentimes chanceth, you may not too h

                     teth in his ſixt Meth. med. ca. 6. It ſhalbe ſufficient if the bone bee ſo much opened that the matter may auoid thereby. Theſe are to be conſidered when the inciſion or fracture is manifeſt: but as concerning ſuch woundes, as haue onely a ſimple fiſſure, ſuch require a ſkilfull and expert Chyrurgion to diſcerne them: for oftentimes it is not to be perceiued by ſight nor handling.
                  The ancient in this caſe, (that is when the fracture is piloſa or Capillaris) did vſe a certaine blacke medicine, which leauing behinde it a blacke ſcarre in the bone, did ſhewe the fracture to bee there. To this purpoſe may bee vſed inke wherewith wee write, tempered with maſticke, or elſe coles with mell Roſate, or elſe (which is better) tartar calcinid till it be blacke, which alſo of his owne accorde eaſily reſolueth: but the later writers doo iudge of the fracture, by applying of aſtringent medicines, for in what place, and where it is ſooneſt dryed (which comes of hot vapours percing through the fracture,) there it is ſhewed to be, which being found out, we muſt preſently ſearch by proper ſignes and tokens, whether the fiſſure dooth paſſe both the tables, or elſe but one: for if it be but in the vppermoſt table only, it ſufficeth to ſcarifie the bone where the fracture is with a razore (which the greekes call 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ) or any other fit inſtrument, as farre as the fracture extendeth, that the bone be made equall, and after proceede to the reſidue of the curation, applying medicines meete for wounds contuſed, of which we haue already intreated in the firſt booke. Moreouer you muſt take great heede in all wounds of the head that they take no moiſture, as Hipoc. witneſſeth de vuln cap. But contrariwiſe, let ſuch things as dry and comfort the head be applied either drie or in powder, or mixed with mell roſate. Such as comfort the head are theſe: the roots of both Ariſtolochies, frankēſence, myrrh, ireos, panax, farina, orobi, and other ſuch like: alſo mercurie precipitate is very good, mixed with mel roſat, & ruineth the ſuperfluitie of bones: but if the riſing perce through, then muſt it bee trapined before the third day, or by ſome other meanes an iſſue made, (as Hippocrates ſaith) which muſt be ſo ample, that inflamation be ſtaide, and a paſſage for the matter made, ſo that throughly it

may be taken away and clenſed, which muſt be done circumſpectly, and with fit and meete inſtruments, which are liuely ſet out by Ambroſius Pareus in the Chapter of woundes of the heade. And this handie worke being ended, wee muſt diligently marke when the broken bone doth waxe loſe, for then it is to be taken out, ſo be it ſticketh not faſt to the panicle, which if it doth, it muſt not bee medled with, leaſt thereby you hurt the panicle or hinder it by letting in of the aire: but you muſt ſtay till ſuch time as the bone fall away of his owne accord, but if the bone be quite ſeparated from the ſkinne, which oftentimes happeneth in ſuch wounds, through the great force of the ſhotte: and there is alſo inflamations, and other davngerous accidents which commonly accompany theſe wounds. Then it muſt preſently be opened, yea before it doe rot, if ſo the Chyrurgion be come in time, which ought to bee both diligent and ſkilfull, and hath a perfite knowledge of all ſuch places as may be trapaned, in that ye ſeams of Crainon, are not to be medled with, but if the wound chance to happen there, then it muſt be trapaned on both ſides, not touching the ſeames, and it muſt be done in that part which ſhall ſeeme moſt conuenient, to auoide the corruption. Moreouer you muſt beware that you trapan not the brows or lower parts of the braine, leaſt thereby (the way being made open) the braine by reaſon of his heauineſſe iſſue out, neither yet about the temples, becauſe of the muſcle, and vitall inſtruments which are there: which thing Galen hath obſerued li. 6. ca. 6. meth. with theſe wordes: Cogitaui preterea accidere poſſe, vt ſi a latere magnum fierit in oſsibus foramen, promineret fortaſsis hac parte cerebrum. Eſt porro & in lateribus non vno in loco-etiam neruorum, horumque non leuis momenti quidem exortus. His admonitus abſtinui ab eximendo oſſe, quod in latere capitis eſſet. But in y• vppermoſt part of the braine, he ſaith there commeth not out any nerue: whereby we may learne that in that place, we may trapan with leſſe daunger. The wound being inlarged, the Chyrurgions doo commonly apply ſantalum as they terine it, which is a peece of red ſil
                        •
                     e cut according to the bigneſſe of the orofice, which ſome apply warme, dipped onely in oile of Roſes: but other mixed therewith mel roſarum and ſome vſe onely hony of roſes, doubting leaſt that through the moiſtneſſe of the oile, the panicle would corrupt. Others thruſt in tentes and linte to fill therby the hollownes of the whole wound: and ſome vſe their degeſtiues as they terme them,

of which we haue ſpoken off before, ſome againe prefer Maced. and Baſilicon, and ſome there bee which vſe a cerote made of the emplaſter of betony diſſolued with oile of Roſes in forme of an vnguent. But according to the minde of Hippoc. ſo ſoone as the panicle of the head is vncouered by taking away Cranion: it ought ſtraight to be clenſed and dryed, leaſt through the prolonging of time it ſwel & corrupt. Now after feare of impoſtumation aboue is paſt, they applie ſuch things as mundifie & incarnate, that thereby the wound at laſt may come to cicatrization, which is brought to paſſe (as we ſaid before) by ſuch medicines as drie and comfort the head. Moreouer it ſhal not be amiſſe, to ſet downe ſome deſcriptions of ſuch medicines which are profitable in wounds of ye heade with fracture of Cranion, and firſt we will ſet downe ſuch as muſt at the firſt dreſſing bee applied to the panicles detected where Cranion is taken away.
                  Take Mel roſat ℥ ii. oile of yolkes of egges ℥ i. mixe them, and dippe therein a peece of ſilke, or lint, and lay it warme to the place, but take this following if you deſire to haue an eaſie and ſpeedie medicine.

                  Take Mellis roſat. ℥ ii. turpentine ʒ i. aqua vitae, gut. x. mix them togither and warme them, and dippe therein your ſantalum or fine lint, and apply it hot to the place, let a chafingdiſh of what coles be by, leaſt the cold aire hinder it by percing in.

                  For common ſouldiers.

But after that the panycle ſhall ſeeme to be couered, then you may vſe medicines which drie more. And ſo you may adde to one ounce of the foreſaid ointment one ʒ. of our precipitate dulcorated, for thereby not onely the ſcales of the bones fall more eaſier away, but alſo hipoſarcoſis or proud fleſh is kept backe, and this medicine may be vſed vntil it be perfitly whole and cicatriſed, foreſeen alwayes that it be couered with Empl. de betoni, or gratia dei, or diadictaum not deſcribed of Galen, or this following.
               
               
                  An excellent emplaiſter for the head.

And to aſſwage inflamation, it is verie good a day or two, in the beginning, to annoynt the partes about the wound with the oyle of roſes, and to applie rowles and bowlſters, as fit and eaſie as may be, and as much as is poſſible to ſhunne the colde ayre: for there is nothing more hurtfull to ſuch woundes. Let a ſlender dyet bee preſcribed, wherein he muſt abſtaine from wine, & all ſuch kind of meates, as ſend fumes and vapors to the head: you muſt not forget alſo to Lib. de vuln. cap. purge, aſwell by phlebotomy, as alſo if neede require by ſeege, And alwaies haue in memorie the ſentence of Hippocrates, which ſaith, that no wound of the head, is to be lightly regarded, yea if the ſkinne be but onely raſed becauſe of the great accidentes and paſſions which commonly happen thereunto, and therefore you

muſt prognoſticate, with great heede taken, thereby to auoyd all rebukes, whereunto commonly thoſe which exerciſe Phiſicke are ſubiect. Therefore the woundes which happen in the ſeames of Cranion are very dangerous, and the more if they bee in the forepart Signa & indicia. of the head and temples, or in the ſides thereof, but not ſo ill, if in the hinder part, as Hippocrates doth witneſſe, and the more the bones are broken, ſo much it is more dangerous, and eſpecially if they hurt dura or pia matter, for wounds by ſhot are made by ſuch violence, that they not onely burſt that they hit, but alſo the part

Theſe are ſignes of death nigh at hand, wanneſſe of collour of the wound, the matter is little and ſtincking, the bone is blacke, puſtels appeare on the toong, redneſſe of the eyes, and Signes of death. other ſome, which may be gathered out of the booke of Hippoc. de vul. cap. and▪ alſo frenſineſſe and crampes comes a little before death.

If a wound therefore be taken ſo nigh that the beard and ſkinne are burnt: you muſt haue recourſe to ſuch medicines which helpe burning, whereof mention is made before: but aboue all the reſt, this following is of great force, for it keepeth backe bliſters, and cauſeth heare to growe, as I learned of a man of no ſmall calling, who affirmed to haue proued it oftentimes.

               Such woundes wherewith the bones are broken, and doth often happen to the armes, & thighes, partly becauſe they are of ſuch greatneſſe, that they oftentimes meete the ſhot, and partly becauſe theſe partes are commonly vnharneſſed, whenſoeuer therefore any patient ſhalbe brought to vs wounded in ſuch ſorte, we muſt ſtraight wayes ſearch and ſeeke with our fingers or inſtrumentes, how the bone is broken, and eſpecially then, when the wound is in the ſhoulder or hipbone, becauſe that a fracture in theſe places, is very dangerous, for through extention, it hurteth the muſkles and ſinewes, which bringeth great inflamations, with grieuous paynes and crampes, and other dangerous accidentes, through which death oftentimes inſueth, without preſent remedie be miniſtred, of which there be two kindes, the one miſerable and pitifull, yet neceſſarie

to preſerue the reſt of the whole bodie, which is, taking off of the member wounded, in that it is ſo hurt and mainied that it is paſt al hope of recouery. But yet in vſing of this extreme remedy in this deſperate caſe, the iudgement of euery common Chyrurgion is not to be followed, which take vpon them that moſt honeſt name, ſo ſoone as they haue learned the way to make m

                  ulſions, inflamations, Gangrena, and at the laſt, mortification, for if there are to be found of the antient Phiſitians, which would in no caſe meddle with ye onely rupture of theſe bones, yea ſome willed the wounded member to be cut off, when the bones but hanged out of y• fleſh, what would they ſay now I pray you if they ſaw theſe horrible ruptures, which happen cōmonly through y• violence of this deadly and diueliſh tormentes, the whiche dayly is ſo increaſed, by the wicked and naughtie deuiſes of ſome, that almoſt there cannot any medicines be found to cure it, nor any harneſſe ſufficient to defend it, but as concerning this heauie and ſorrowful remedie, which is ye diſinēbring the member, we ſhal haue a fitter place to intreate of it, in the chapter of Gangrena and Sphacelus. For nowe we will goe to the other remedie, which is more profitable and better, and is done by manuell operation as they tearme it, and muſt be aſſayed by all meanes, as wee haue ſayd in

the beginning of this chapter. To which purpoſe the Chyrurgions, ſet downe two intentions, whereof the one reſpecteth the rupture, and willeth as nigh as may bee, that all the broken bones be reduced to their naturall ſeates, which being done, ſhe commandeth the whole ioynt to be rowled and preſſed with linnen clothes, wetted firſt in ſome conuenient liquor to keepe backe all accidentes, the which ſome allowe at the firſt dreſſing, that the vnetion may be the ſurer, and woulde not haue it quite vndone, till fortie dayes be expired, but to loſe it, and binde it harder, in the meane ſpace, as neede ſhall require, except it be through intollerable itching, inflamation, paine, or ſuch like: and to remedie ſuche, they preſcribe an orderly dyet, or bloudletting, or operation, or ſuche locall medicines, as ſhalbe thought meete.
               The other intention reſpecteth the wound, and forbiddeth that it be hid and rowled ſo faſt, as is vſed in fractures, in that it requireth to be dreſſed oft, that the filth and excrementes whiche nature expelleth may haue iſſue, and for that cauſe ſome vſe ſtraightwayes ſetones (as they tearme them) if it may eaſily bee put in the wound, which they annoint firſt with meete medicines: And ſome vſe onely tentes, and if neede require, they alſo amplifie and inlarge the orifice thereof, and likewiſe the lower partes, whereby all filth and baggage may iſſue out the better, and ſo the parts are broughtin a better caſe, & eaſier to be cured, Likewiſe they dayly diminiſh their tents, making them ſhorter & ſhorter, whereby ye wound may heale the better and incarnate the faſter, to which purpoſe they vſe medicines meete for wounds by ſhot, of which we made relation in the former treatiſe. Moreouer to finiſh this laſt intention, they haue a great regard to charge the patient to vſe meates that are iuicy and good, and ſuch as conglutinate, till ſuch time as Callus is growne, and chiefly becauſe the nature of thoſe woundes is ſuche, that they ſeeme to tarie for the conſolidation of the bones. This maner of curing is vſed nowe adayes of diuers Chyrurgions, when ye bones are fractured, whoſe iudgement I could not but highly commend (becauſe they haue of their ſides, the opinion of moſte excellent men, which haue and doe vſe the ſame maner of curiyng) were it not that the thing it ſelfe, and alſo experience did plainely teache me, and as it were ſet before my eyes, the innumerable inconueniences, which happen through theſe ſplintes, and hard binding, for they oftentimes bring accidentes, as paine, inflamation, and Gangrena,
                  
whereunto theſe kindes of woundes are greatly ſubiect, alſo they hinder the exhallations of theſe humours, which in theſe woundes abound, and oftentimes choke naturall heate, and do hinder the knowledge of manie greeuous accidentes, and letts, that remedie therefore cannot eaſi

                  y be miniſtred as it ought, except it be, when it is too late when they are compelled to looſe theſe round and croſſe bandes: which is done then perhaps, when theſe commodities haue ſo taken hold, that they cannot wel be remedied, as they might if in time they had bene looked to: wherefore theſe vulgar and common ligatures, meet only for fractures, by my iudgement, is no wayes to be vſed in woundes ioyned with fractures, and eſpecially in thoſe which happen by ſhot, and ioyned with fractures, as may be gathered by reaſons before alledged, in whiche caſe it behoueth the Chyrurgion to be carefull, leaſt he do any thing wilfullie and raſhly which after, too late he may repent. Nowe in my iudgement I thinke it beſt, that the bones by and by before inflamation be ingendred, be brought in their ſeate and naturall forme, with as little paine as may be to the patient, and then to vſe ſuch medicines, as are profitable to both intēctions that is, for the wound & fracture, and becauſe I haue ſeene the verie ſame order vſed of moſt learned and ſkilfull Phiſitions, being of mine acquaintance, aſwel in Germany as in diuers other places. I thought it not good to paſſe ouer this order, whiche they are woont to holde and followe in curing wounds with fracture, eſpecially becauſe I iudge y• it is moſt meet for woundes by ſhotte, in that they diſcommend this common and hard ligaturs or binding, for no other cauſe, but for the paine, inflamations, and Gangrena, whiche commonly comes thereby, whereunto thoſe woundes by ſho

In the meane while in the would it ſelfe, & about it, vſe fit medicines and defenſiues, of which wee haue ſpoken before. Moreouer you muſt ſee that the wounded part be rightly placed, & if need be, rowled in a plate of lead, bowed to the faſhion of a leg or an arme, or els wt ſodden lether faſtened together with buckles, whereby the bones, which were broken, may the ſurer be holden together, which ought not, (as litle as may be) be ſhaken and mooued, vntill hee is cured, and the bandes looſed, and vſe alſo vulnerary potions meete to that purpoſe, by which onely I haue ſeene fractures cured, the bones beeing rightly placed, and that I haue ſeene to be eſpecially obſerued in Germany. I remember alſo I learned at Reyſtadium not farre from Rayns, that the inhabiters there doe vſe a certaine ſtone named by his vertue Beinbruch, they giue one dram thereof in red wine in the morning, wherein periuincle was infuſed all night, & continue ſo iiii. or v. dayes, & by this meanes they take away paine and dangerous accidentes, and heale the fracture in foure or fiue daies, to the great admiration of all men, whereof I my ſelfe am witneſſe, and alſo Matheolus 
                     Lib. 5. cap. 109. maketh mention thereof in hys commentaries: Alſo they are woont to vſe the ſame ſtone made in forme of a cataplaſme, with Geranio bruſed, and oyle oliue, or oile of Roſes, which commeth to ſo good effect, that the bones doo conglutinate without any paine or inflamation, which were almoſt incredible: were not, that beſides my ſelfe, there were innumerable witneſſes which haue ſeene it with their eyes. Wherefore I iudge that this kinde of medicine is moſt excellent in theſe kinde of wounds ioyned with fracture, for the greateſt part of the worke is paſt, when the bones bru

Moreouer it openeth to vs a compendious and briefe curation, and moſt fitteſt to eaſe the ſicke. But in ſo much as the ſtone is not to bee had in all places

               CHAP. 1111. Of wounds by ſhot which perce the other part of the bodie without fracture of the bones.
               FUrthermore if the ſhot haue perced the breaſt, ſides or lower parts of the belly: it muſt be conſidered whether the wound extendeth to the hollownes thereof: and if it do, whether any principall part be hurt, that you may giue a perfite prognoſtication, as we haue taught in the chapter de ſig. & Iudic. For if it perceth not the body, it requireth not any other kinde of handling or healing then that generally deſcribed of vs before: but if it happen otherwiſe then there are ſome things to be obſerued properly and particularly, for if caſe the breſt be perced, and the bullet not gone through, we muſt aſſay to take it out, and not onely that, but alſo whatſoeuer is therein elſe: and we muſt wiſely waigh whether any blood he fallen in the hollowneſſe thereof, which if it be, it muſt warily be taken ou
                     •
                   in turning and placing the bodie of the ſicke, in ſuch wiſe as ſhall ſeeme beſt. And all other kinde of remedies for this purpoſe, muſt be vſed by enlarging the wound, and leauing it open vntill time require, that the blood may come forth the better, and by this meanes diuers incommodities are withſtoode, which commonly comes through the retention of bloode in theſe partes, whereunto theſe wounds are greatly ſubiect. Alſo in this caſe vulner arie potions are of great force, in that they diſſolue y• conieled blood, and keepe it from coagulations, and miniſter them to the ſicke firſt euery morning, and alſo in the euening, as you haue learned in the laſt chapter of our Antidot. de potio vul. The reſt of the curation you may performe by ſuch wayes and remedies as are vſed in other wounds by ſhot. But yet this one thing is ſingularly and particularly to be obſerued, that ſuch medicines be altered, and their formes chaunged into iniections, as neede ſhall require: for otherwiſe they cannot reach the bottome thereof to worke their force, which iniections may be made of theſe medicines which are preſcribed of vs in the former treatiſe: and they muſt be caſt in by a ſpoute, which I haue proued to erreſt all other inſtrumentes, in that it ſucketh vp againe that which he caſt in, which is required in the vſe of the remedies. After this you ſhall faſten ſome tent with

a threed, and put it in the hollownes of the wound, of ſuch length as ſhall ſeeme meeteſt to keep
                     •
                   alwayes the mouth of the wounde open, that the inward parts being purged and clenſed, may by litle and litle incarnat, before the orofice be quite growne togither, leaſt otherwiſe the filth within might be ſtopped. Moreouer whiles the ſicke is a healing, he muſt eſchew the cold aire: for nothing is more hurtfull to ſuch wounds, and if both ſides be perced, you muſt put tents in both holes, and by ſo much the more keepe them open the longer that the matter way the eaſier haue iſſue. But if that Callus happen to growe, as ſometimes it doth, apply ſuch remedies as hereafter ſhalbe declared. As concerning his diet, let him keepe ſuch as is preſcribed in other wounds, that is cold, dry, and ſclēder, but let him abſtaine from aſtringent and ſharpe meates, and that from the beginning, becauſe they moue the cough, and bring ſhortneſſe of breath, which thing commonly doth greatly hurt the ſeely ſicke patient: contrariwiſe ſuch things as comfort the breſt, are very good, as figges, raiſons picked, barly and other like, and bloodletting alſo is very good, and euacuation by gliſter, and otherwiſe if the body be filled with ill iuice: The like in all points is to be obſerued in wounds of the belly, thecuration of which is not vnlike to the cure of other wounds by ſhot, which we haue ſet downe already, although theſe vulner ary potions are more in vſe, in that in the partes they more perfitly worke, and ſhew their ſtrength. And ſuch potious muſt bee mixed as intentions ſhall require, and more ſtrengthners muſt be vſed, if any nutritiue part be hurt, as the liuer and ſplene, which alſo is good to foment outwardly: and ſometimes ſuch wounds are cured by giuing fit gliſters, when they ſhall touch the lower parts: but if the perce the body, and hurt the backe bone, then you muſt vſe theſe remedies which wee haue preſcribed in wounds of the heade: and the like iudgement is to bee giuen, if the marrow of the backe come forth, as was before touching the braine.
               But becauſe it oftentimes happeneth, that the ſhotte is drawne from the vpper parts lower, and ſo ſticketh in ſome member, and commeth not out, in which caſe the filth and matter cannot haue iſſue out, then it muſt be wayed, where the ſhot may without daunger be taken out by the lower way, which the eaſier may bee done if you may feele it with your fingers, for yt wayes it may far better be taken out, as we ſaid before, where we intreated of taking out things infixed: but if that cannot be, then muſt we vſe compreſſions

In theſe kinds of wounds, tents made of ſponges are very good, becauſe they draw corruption and ſucke it in, and dry the wound. But becauſe oftentimes the lippes of the wound ware hard, which letteth perfite conſolidation, you ſhall therefore vſe the remedies following, for they are moſt fitin this caſe and for all fiſtulaes, neither ſhall you need to vſe hot irons, the which extreme remedy the common Chyrurgeons are wont to apply.

                  Of griefe.
                  We aſſwage paine with onodinis, or els with paregoricis medicamentis, which are temperate & agreeable to our bodies, and hold in the firſt degree, and of a thinne ſubſtance, and this we doe with fometation and lynaaments.
                  Fomentations are made with the decoction of the root of hollihocke, ſheepes heades, mallowes, of the flowers of Mullein, camomill mellilote of the ſeedes of linen fenigrecke and milke.
                  Lynaments are made of ye Macilage ſeminum pſillij, fenigreck, and of hollihock of butter, capons greaſe, and bawſons greaſe, of oesypo and oyle of viſci pomorum.

                  Of diſtemperature.
                  If a whote diſtemperature do moleſt the wounded part, which

is eaſily knowne by paine and bliſtering thereof, then annoint it with vnguent nutrito, or Caphurato albo with populion: & this following is of great force.
                  Take the iuice of plantaine, night ſhade, houſeleeke ana ℥ i. bolearmeny ℥ ſs. litharge waſhed with plantine water and tuttie prepared ana ℥ i. oleiroſ. omphac. and of nenuphar ana ℥ ii. vineger of roſes and a little waxe, and make an vnguent.
                  But if it haue a colde diſtemperature which is knowne by the faſtneſſe, then is it remedied by fomenting therof with wi
                        •
                     e, wherein was ſodden dill, lyneſeed, and the flowers of Camomel. Wherof alſo you may make a cataplaſine. We ſpeake nothing of Haemorrhagia, becauſe we haue made ſufficient mention thereof before.
               
               
                  Of the feuer.
                  You muſt preſently beware that a feuer come not, but keepe him backe by a cold and ſlender diet: by blood letting and by purging ſuch humors as offend. But if it chāce that it increaſeth (as I haue oft ſeene) and breed to an ague, then the humors muſt be digeſted with ſome conuenient decoction, and then purged againe, wherunto the Phiſition muſt take diligent heede, and by ali meanes helpe the ſicke, leaſt by the ſharpneſſe of the griefe, death doth follow.
               
               
                  Of conuulſions.
                  The Phiſitions affirme that conuulſions may come by three occaſions: the firſt is emptineſſe, which proceedeth through ouermuch purging, or immoderate bleeding, which is daungerous, as Hippoc. witneſſeth Aphon. 3. lib. v. The ſeconde is repletion or fulneſſe, which happeneth through vnnatural tumors riſing about the wounde and ſuddenly vaniſhing away: and through ouermuch cold which contracteth the ſinewes, and ſtaieth them backe and filleth them, the which alſo Hippoc. hath noted Afforiſme 17. lib. 5. It happeneth alſo, the braine being affected per conſenſum, by reaſon of great paine, when either a ſynew is pricked, or elſe when ſharpe by
                        •
                     ing and venemous humors do alter and corrupt nature: whereof comes paines, as Hippoc. witneſſeth, through which by the vehemencie of the ſence, cramps ariſe.
                  Conuulſion comming through emptineſſe is thus cured: Firſt let a diet be preſcribed which is moiſt, & let the ſicke take ſupings Conuulſion through emptineſſe. of almond milke, ptiſan, or any conuenient broth, and prepare him

a bath wherein hath bene boiled moiſt things and ſuch as haue vertue to aſſwage paine, ſuch are the heades and feete of wethers: alſo the rootes of holihocks, mallowes, violets, and the leaues of miſtelto of the apple tree, and let the ſicke ſtande therein, if ſo his wounde will ſuffer him, or els foment the affected part therewith. After this annoint it with oleo viſci pomorum & violarum, or with ſome ointment made of the aforeſaid things. And becauſe this concluſion proceeding through emptineſſe, being once conſumed is incurable, as Galen ſaith in lib. 7. Meth. meden. Wee muſt haue therefore recourſe to ſome excellent remedie, that is the tincture of gold, or of ye natural Balme, for if there be any hope left, it conſiſteth in theſe two.

And contrariwiſe ſuch muſt be eſchewed as are raw and colde, and ſuch as ſtoppe and hinder perſpiration. Likewiſe Galen forbiddeth the vſe of hot water, as a thing very hurtful to ye wounded ſinews, becauſe they conſiſt of cold, moiſt & cōiealed ſubſtance, the which being ſo, muſt needs putrifie and reſolue by the applying of ſuch thinges as are hot and moilt. And therefore hot water is hurtfull to them, although otherwiſe it greatly aſwageth impoſtumation, whereof I admoniſh thoſe which indifferently without any regarde, vſe this remedy in theſe wounds by ſhot: for Galen writeth, in li. 6. meth. med. that rather oleum iaſminum, & eſpecially ſabinum veterum, are moſte profitable for wounds of the ſinews. He aloweth alſo turpentine & roſine, & likewiſe Sulphur viuum, in the ſame book is greatly commended of him in wounds of the nerues, in that it is of a ſubtill ſubſtance, & then it muſt needs follow that theſe oiles drawne chymically out

of turpentine, roſine, waxe, Sulphur, and ſabine to be of a greater force, becauſe by diſtillation they are made much more ſubtiller: and thereby they doo drie more ſtrongly. The which thing Galen ſaith lib. 6. Meth. med. is to be obſerued in puncturs of the nerues, for h

                  We haue written of ſundrie accidentes and inconueniences happening to theſe woundes, but yet there is none ſo pitifull and dangerous, as is Gangrena, which is a token of corruption drawing on, which comes according to the opinion of Paul, eyther becauſe

                     ght in our ſpagiricall Antidotary. For other wiſe I cannot allowe the iudgement of thoſe which will yt Arſnick crude and vnprepared to be vſed in Gangrena becauſe it is a medicine coroſiue, and putrifactiue, & through the euil and venomous qualitie that it hath, it deſtroyeth the ſubſtance of the fleſh, and bringes it to a rotten and ſtincking deadlineſſe, whiche is farre worſe then Gangrena it ſelfe, wherefore by their leaue the vſe thereof is verie dangerous, except firſt (as wee ſayde before) it be rightly prepared. And ſhall not be amiſſe, in the meane while to lay thereon a Cataplaſme made with the flower of Lupins orobus lentils, and beanes, which may be boyled with oximell or the lye aforeſayd. But and if all theſe medicines doe nothing preuayle, but by the foreſayd ſignes, you perceiue that Gangrena will grow to ſphacelus, then muſt you preſently (if it may be) cut of the member, ſo much that nothing that is corrupted remaynes: which ſome doe, without anie paine at all, with a threed made de Alumine plumae and dippid in the oyle of Mercurie ſublymate, called of ſome, aqua infernalis. Others take it off wt a ſawe, & then ſeare it with a hote iron, and ſo by the aduiſe of Galen, they ſtop quickly the fluxe of bloud, driue awaie putrifaction and ſtrengthen the member. After that the putrifaction is taken away, and the fluxe of bloud ſtayed, they vſe ſuch medicines as take away the ſcarre, as vnguent macedonicum, butter, and ſuch like: and after yt, ſuch cure is conuentent as to other vlcers: but in the meane while, you may not forget to preſcribe an orderly kind of diet, & ſuch a one as is both ſlender and cooling, as bloud-letting, or any medicines, which clarifie y• bloud if need ſhall require, neyther forbid ſuch medicines as defend the heart, (the fountame of life) from all filthie and euillfumes comming from the ſicke member to the ſame.
               
               
                  THE SPAGERICKE ANTIDOTARIE OF the preparation and making of medicines againſt Gunſhot.
                  IT is an olde and true ſaying of the Poet. That there is nothing more imperious then an ignorant man, which thinketh nothing

well done, but what hee doth himſelfe, which thing, as it may be ſeene in many other arts, yet moſt ſpecially in this, which is called y• 
                     Spagericke arte. For we ſee euery where certame men, I knowe not what they be, puffed vp with a certaine barbarous and fooliſhe pride, which with great ſcorne inuey againſt thoſe medicines which are drawne out of the mettaline mines: Which notwithſtanding, it is apparant were in vſe and had in great eſtimation with the chiefe antient Phiſitions, as we haue declared in that booke which we haue ſet forth of the ſpagiricke preparation of medicines. And what I pray you is the cauſe of this anger, or rather madneſſe: but that (as they themſelues confeſſe) they knowe not the preparation of them. O happie artes, if onely artificers might iudge them, (as Fabius is reported ſometime to haue ſaid.) Then are they vnhappy of whome the ignorant and vnlearned feare not ſo raſhly to giue iudgement, which neuer yet vnderſtoode from whence, or why, this is called the Spagiricke arte whiche learned men of two Greeke wordes haue ſo named, becauſe by that arte, a certaine ſubtill and ſpirituall nature is drawne, gathered and preſſed out, wherein the force and effect of the medicine doth chiefly confiſt. The great and incomparable commoditie whereof as it appeareth in many other diſeaſes, ſo ſhall it chiefly be knowne in curing woundes by Gunſhot. As I truſt (God willing) it ſhall much more happily be tryed and found out by the preparations of medicines animall, vegetable, and minerall, and by other eſſences drawne out of mercurie, Sulphur. Ʋitrioll, arſenicke, Iron, Copper, Lead, and Litarge, and alſo out of Antimony and ſuch other mineralles, as alſo out of ye groſe and fattie bodies of ſimple mettals: of whome it is farre off, that the force ſhould be ſo great, although the antient Phiſitions haue vſed them to cure woundes, and vlcers, (as their writinges doe teſtifie) as the force of their ſpirites, which may be called, as it were their ſoules. But (peraduenture ſome of thoſe backebiters wil ſay) why are not we content with thoſe medicines which the learned antiquitie hath deliuered vnto vs, and that Hypocrates and Galen the antient pillers of our arte and others haue ſet forth in theyr monumentes: Why doe we ſeeke new wayes neuer heard of before, ſpecially vnknowne to the Apothecaryes: But ſome of vs will anſwere, that the only remedie of Mercurie precipitate, is the onelie remedie (to paſſe ouer other) which verie lately they haue begun to vſe, in curing of woundes by Gunſhot and other maligne v

were ſufficient to aunſwere this their queſtion, yea and to reproue their follie ioyned with intoller able pride. But if authoritie be aſked for, I thinke Geſner, Guinter, Andernacke, Seuerine (to paſſe ouer a great many other) wil be for vs as great authoritie wt the learned: as theſe ſlanderers. Specially becauſe the learning of theſe famous men is ſo confirmed by their learned writinges and monumentes, that thoſe toonges might count it a greater honoue vnto them to confeſſe themſelues their ſchollers. It were eaſie for me to bring forth many other argumentes, if I did not ſee the follie of theſe backbiters to be ſo great, wherof truely I am aſhamed, ſpecially when I behold ſome of their books lately ſet forth, wherein, contrarie to the purpoſe of the treatiſe, ſtrange thinges are infarced, that (as the olde prouerbe ſaith) the oyntment ſeemeth to conſiſt in nothing: as though they pertained to the purpoſed intreating of curing the gout, certain inuectiue digreſſions I know not what, of the beginning of thinges, of the originall of mettals & Philoſophers ſtone (which of them is called Moroſophocus) or did in any other poynt ſeeme to agree with it. Therefore againe and againe I am inforced to crie out. O happie artes if onely artificers might iudge of them. How farre vnlike was the purpoſe of many old men, the which if they were ignorant of any thing, which they vnderſtood, was knowne of other, euen in farre diſtant countries, they ſpared no labour to goe ſee them. Plato inflamed with deſire to learne thoſe thinges, which he knew not, went into Egypt, and after to Tarentum to Architas, and ouer all Italie to heare the other Pythagoricall Philoſophers, Appollonius Tyanius trauailed through the kingdome of Perſia, and paſſed ouer the mountaine Caucaſus, and viſited the Albanes, Scythians, Maſſagetes, and all the rich kingdomes of India. Afterwardes was caried vnto the Brachmanes, and heard Iarchus in his chaire of gold diſputing of the hidden cauſes of thinges, and of the hidden miſteries of nature. From thence by the Elanutes, Babylonians, Chaldees, Meedes, Aſſirians, Arabians, and Paleſtines, he returned to Alexandria, and from thence went into Ethiopia to heare the Gymnoſophiſtes, and to learne their ſecret and hidden artes. This vertue is truely to be followed, and not the ſluggiſhneſſe of thoſe ſlothfull followers, which hauing ſearſe once moued their foote from their countrie fires, yet will diſalowe this Spagericke arte, and thinke

But I pray you, what fooliſhnes is this, to forbid vs to vſe any other medicins then thoſe which were known in old time: As though Rhabarbe, then which no medicine is more in vſe at this day, thē were known to the olde Phiſitions. Further to what purpoſe is it that they obiect vnto vs ye ſulphurie metaline, & venomous ſtinckes (as they call them) by whoſe ſmell and drawne breath (for theſe are their contumelious words) they be almoſt ſtrangled that come into the dennes of thoſe Cyclops?

I call to minde a ſtorie peraduenture knowne vnto thē of Heraclito Epheſio, which being ſick of a dropſie, diſpiſing the helpe of Phiſitions, annoynting himſelfe ouer with Cowdoong, ſet himſelfe in the ſunne to drie, and falling a ſleepe was torne in peeces of dogges: but theſe are more then ſufficiently anſwered vnto theſe ſcoles and ſlanderers. Nowe will I declare what is my purpoſe and ſcope in this treatiſe: verily to preſcribe plainely hereafter, not thoſe thinges which are alreadie common, or (as it is commonly ſayde) knowne to blinde men and barbers, leaſt I might ſeeme to imitate thoſe which write rhapſodias and heapes, but the methode and way of preparing medicines by Spagericke arte, that pertaine vnto Gunſhot, which I knowe are yet vnknowne vnto many Phiſitions and Chyrurgions. And this I can truely confeſſe that I am induced for two cauſes to doe it. Firſt to prouoke thoſe that are better learned, if they haue any better medicines, to vtter them, as alſo that I might ſpecially help

my countrie and mankinde: vnto the which (the more is the griefe) there is too much neede of thoſe kinde of medicines in theſe moſte lamentable and cruell times, wherein it hath ſo long bene bloudied with domeſticall and Ciuell warres: but to encounter with their ſlaunders which crie out that theſe kinde of medicines doe not onele require long and diffic
                        •
                     le preparation, but alſo that they are ſo deare that euerie one cannot eaſily vſe them. I haue thought good therefore firſt to ſet downe common medicines, and then to come to thoſe which I doe farre more eſteeme, as indeede they are farre more excellent then the other, as by their preparatiō you may know. Albeit alſo I haue determined to haue conſideration of the poore and common ſouldier, and to ſet downe them apart that ſhall helpe the rich.
                  THerefore the Chyrurgions are to bee admoniſhed that when they go into the warres that they take with them theſe things readie prepared, which are to be had at moſt Pothecaries.
