            To the Christian Reader.
            
               OF what moment and importance
this Christian
Almanacke ensuing may
be vnto thee (good
Christian reader,) it will
easily appeare, if thou wilt but vouchsafe
the reading thereof, and wilt also
consider with thy selfe, that the daies
and times wherein wee liue, are very
dangerous and sinnefull; for that Sathan,1. Pet. 5. 8,
the common enemie of Mankinde,
goeth about continually like a
roaring Lyon seeking whom hee may
deuour; and how by all manner of
subtilty, by the world, and the flesh;
by the commodities, pleasures and vanities
of them both; by prosperity and
aduersitie,Bernard. he endeuoureth, leauing no
meanes vnattempted,Mundus, Diabolus, Caro &c. to the intent that
he may destroy vs both body and

soule; it is high time therefore, that
wee looke vnto our selues, and by a
Christian Almanacke recount and
Calculate our dayes, and with that
most holy Arithmetician the prophet
Dauid, and with Moses the man of
God, pray vnto the Lord to teach vs,
so to number our dayes,Psal. 90. et vers▪
                   12▪
                that wee may
apply our harts to wisedome; that we
lay hold on oportunity, and make
the best vse of our time, that we may
profit our selues in holy and religious
excercises, that we may walke as the
children of light, in the light, before
that darknes come vpon vs vnawares,Iohn 1
                     •
                  . vers. 35 36.
that wee may not harden our harts in
the day of the Lords visitation.
                  
                     〈◊〉
                  . 3. ver. 7. 8. Oh let
vs consider that our life is short, and
that the lampe thereof is quickly put
out, before we are aware; that our
time is precious and therefore to be redeemed;
irreuocable, and being once
past, cannot be called backe againe; it

                  •
               s the rarest Iewell, and the greatest
treasure of all treasures; time and tide

will not alwaies last, it will tarry for no
man. The children of this world be
wiser in their generation then wee, who
professe our selues to be Christians.
Who is there of them, that maketh not
great account of his Almanacke, to
obserue both dayes, times and seasons,
to follow his affayres for his best profit
and vse? The Mariner obserueth
time, winde, and tide, that he may
hoyse vp Saile and be gone: the
Lawier obserueth the Terme time,
that he may dispatch his Clients suites,
for when terme is done, there is no
more time for their businesse, the trauailer
hath regard to the weather and
season by his Almanacke, and if he can
learne thereby that he shall haue a faire
day, he riseth early to be gone away
in the morning; euery thri
                  •
               ty husband
can make vse of his time, obserue his
daies, houres, moneths and weekes, for
his profit; shall not wee then, that
would be Christians, shew our selues
more carefull for the spending of our

daies, times and houres, that we may
profit in Christianity, it is alway terme-time
with Christians, euery day, euery
houre requireth a religious imployment
for the good of our soules, yea
this presēt time is our terme-time. The
neglect of time and oportunitie, is a
sinne much condemned in the scriptures,
and especially by our Sauiour
Christ, whenas he rebuketh the Scribes
and Pharisies,Mat. 16. 3. calling them hypocrites,Luk. 12. 56.
because they could not discerne the face of
the Skye, but could not discerne the
signes of the times. And God himselfe
by the prophet Ieremy,
               Ier. 8. 7. complaineth,
that the very foule, and birdes of the
ayre obserued their times and seasons,
but his people were ignorant. And verily
of all follies and Ignorances, this is
the greatest, not to know the times &
seasons after the manner of true Christtians,
not to know the day of our visitation,
when God offereth this mercies
to vs, by the ministry of his word, by
stretching out his hands all the day

long;Rom. 10. 21. he standeth at the dore of our
harts knocking by the sound of his
word outwardly, and by the motion of
his spirit inwardly, by threatnings, promises,
mercies, iudgments, and yet we
listen not, we care not, we are lulled a

                  ••
               eepe with ease & prosperity, and we
continually make excuses and delayes
through slumbering and sluggishnesse,
like the spouse in the Canticles,Cant. 5. 2. 3 notwithstanding
her Bridegroomes fer
               
                  •
               ent
loue towards her, waiting all the

                  •
               ight long at her doore vntill his
lockes were hoary with dew. wherefore
we ought to be wary and circumspect,
how wee spend our time, for God will
require an account of vs for the same,
and therefore let vs redeeme it with an
high estimate, let vs looke into our

                  •
               aies, weekes, moneths, &c. and earnestly

                  •

               CHAP. 1.
               Concerning the Gouernours
of this yeare.
               
                  WHEN I looke well and
consider the high Master
of the Stars in his Doctrine,
and in writing I
finde that this yeare &
from henceforth vnto the end of the
world, the Sunne, Mars and Mercurius
shall raigne: Now whereas other men

séeke their speculation out of the stars,
that doe not I respect so much as experience
in the Doctrine of Christ, and
for the exhortation and warning of all
estates, I will describe the nature and
properties of these thrée gouernours,
the Sunne a mighty Lord ouer heauen
and earth,Psal. 2. is Iesus Christ our onely
Redéemer and Sauiour in all things
like vnto his heauenly father,Iohn. 14. Ver. 10. 
                  The
brightnes of his glory,
                  Heb. 1. Ver. 3. the image of the
inuisible God by whom all things that
are in heauen and earth were created,Col. 1. Ver. 15.
things visible and inuisible, whether
they be Maiesties or Lordships either
rulers or powers.
               This Iesus Christ the euerlasting
word of his heauenly Father,Heb. 2. 6. which
tooke our nature vppon him he is Alpha
and Omega,
                  Phi. 2. 6. 7. 
                  the beginning and the
ending,
                  Reu. 1. 8. 
                  which is, and which was, and
which is to come, euen the Almighty, and
sheweth vs his Fathers will, comming
into this world, brought with him Mars,
that is the Gospell euen out of the
bosome of his Father. But wonder
not that I call the Gospell Mars.

                   Christ
our Sauiour saith, Thinke not that I

come to send peace vppon earth, I come
not to send peace but a sword; for I am
come to set a man at variance against his
Father, and the daughter against her mother,
and the daughter inlaw against her
mother inlaw, and a mans enemies shalbe
them of his owne house-holde, is not
this a battell 
                     •
                  hat shall put you to trouble
saith he and kill you.Math. 24. 
                        •
                     
                   
                  And of all
people shall ye be hated for my name
sake.
                  Persecution followeth the Gospell. Therefore may the Gospell well
be called Mars, for where it is preached,
there is y• sword, there is trouble & persecution,
there will the enemies rage
at the preachers thereof, as for Mercurus
the Poets fayne him to be the messenger
and Oratour of the heathen
Gods, for the which cause he may well
be liked vnto the world, which with
eloquence, paynted words, and outward
appearance performeth the message
of the deuill, and entiseth men so
long vntill it bring them into destruction.
But as Saint Iohn saith in his Epistle,1. Iohn. 2. 17.
the world passeth away & the lust
thereof, and as Saint Paule saith, The
fashion of this world passeth away,
                  1. Cor. 7 3
                        •
                     
                   therefore
must we so holde vs within the

feare of God, that we suffer not our
selues to be deceaued or seduced by
Mercurius from the Sunn and Mars,
least we be corrupted with this deceiptful
world, and so be defrauded of
the ioy of the euerlasting world to come.
Neither should the paynted wisedome
of this world moue vs,1. Cor. 1. 18 in asmuch as
God maketh it very foolishnes; and
his word, which séemeth to be but foolishnes
in the sight of the world,Rom. 16. that
sheweth he to be the onely wisedome, &
the very power of God to the saluation
of as many as beléeue therein: whosoeuer
now hath the Grace to perceiue
and consider this, let him not goe after
Mercurius, let him not follow the world,
and the beautifull lust thereof,Math. 7. 13. let him
not enter in at the wide gate and broad
way,Iohn. 14. 6. that leadeth to destruction, but let
him goe in at the straight gate and narrow
way, which is euen Iesus Christ,
He is the way the truth and the life.
                  Iohn. 10. 9. The
onely mercy-seate and meane to come
by the fauour of God, by him whosoeuer
entreth, he may be sure to be saued
to receiue mercy, finde grace, and to be
helped in the time of néede, which God

the father graunt vs for his Sonnes
sake.
            
            
               CHAP. 2.
               Concerning the increase or growing
of fruits, and the dearth
of the same.
               
                  THe Sunne sheweth playnely
that All such as feare God shall
haue a very fruitfull yeare,Psal. 1

plenteousnes in the daies of dearth,Psal. 37. 19
                  in so much that though Christ send
without shooes, yet will he so prouide
for them, that they shall lacke nothing,
for he saith himselfe.

                   Be not careful
for your life, what yee shall eate or
what ye shall drinke, or yet for your body,
what ye shall put on, is not the life more

worth then meate, and the body then
rayment; Behold the fowles of the Ayre,
for they sow not, neither reape, nor yet
carry into the barnes,psal. 147. 9. and yet your heauenly
father feedeth them,Psal. 145. 15 yea he giueth
to the beasts their foode, and to the
young Rauens that cry. The eyes of all
waite vpon thee and thou giuest them
their meate in due season, thou openest
thine hand and fillest all things liuing of
thy good pleasure: Therefore though
our hands should be alwaies occupied
in some good labour, yet ought not our
harts to take thought what we shall
eate or drinke,
                  Ephe. 4. 28. 
                  but first to care how to
seeke the kingdome of God, and so shall
all things necessary be ministred vnto vs.
And if you would care or take thought,
follow the Counsell of the Apostle, And
this I say brethren, because the time is
short hereafter,
                     
                        •
                     or. 1. 29. that they which haue
wiues be as though they had none, and
they that weepe, as though they wept
not, and they that reioyce as though they
reioyced not, & they that buy as though
they possessed not, and they that vse this
world as though they vsed it not: for the
fashion of this world goeth away. And

why should we not care? because Man
liueth not by bread onely, but by euery
word that proceedeth out of the mouth
of God:Deut. 8. 3. 
                  which thing Christ our Sauiour
declared manifestly,
                  Mat. 4. 4. 
                  in that he fedde
so many people with so few loaues and
fishes: like as he had done before vnto
the Children of Israel by the space of
forty yeares in the wildernes, where
they wanted no thing: for he himselfe
fedde them and blessed them in all the
works of their hands.
                  Iohn 6. 27 
                  And Christ forbad
vs to labour for the meat that perisheth,
but for the meate that endureth
vnto euerlasting life. Wherefore insomuch
as God our mercifull father
taketh such care for vs,
                  1. Pet. 5. 7 
                  and his Apostle
Peter his bidding was,
                  Psal. 55.

                   Cast all our care
vpon him for he careth for vs, as also the
Psalmist Dauid, Cast thy burden vpon
the Lord and he will nourish thee, he will
not sée the righteous to fall for euer, as
also the holy prophet Dauid in another
place,
                  Psal. 37. 5. Commit thy way vnto the Lord
and trust in him and he shall bring it to
passe; wée should then by right cast all
our care vpon him and faithfully to
cleane vnto his word in our harts, so

that we neither mistrust his Godly
prouision, nor leade an Idle life,
and if we meane well in our harts,
and deale truely with our hands,
doubtles he shall send vs necessary
meate by some body, as he did to Elias
the Prophet, first in sending y• Rauens
to féed him,
                  2. Reg. 17. 4. 6. 
                  for the Rauens brought him
bread and flesh in the Morning, and
bread & flesh in the Euening, and he
dranke of the Riuer: and secondly he
fedde him by the widdowe of Sarepta,
Cap. eodem. And like as he prouided
a breakfast for Daniell amongst the
Lyons by y• ministration of Abacuck.Da

haue plenty and aboundance of all
things this yeare: As for the multitude
of the vngodly in generall, there shall
come a great dearth vppon them, according
to the words of a certaine true
Astronomer:
                  Amos. 8. 12. Behold the time commeth,
saith the Lord God, that I will send a famine
in the land, not a famine of bread,
nor a thirst for water, but of hearing
the word of the Lord, and they shall
wander from sea to sea, & from the North
euen to the Easte, shall they come to and

fro, to seeke the word of the Lord, and
shall not finde it. But because they receiue
not the loue of the truth, that they
might be saued,
                  Thes. 2. 10. 
                  and therefore God
shall send them strong Illusions, that
they might beléeue lies;
                  Luk. 17. 22. 
                  so that the
dayes will come when ye shall desire
to sée one of the dayes of the sonne of
man,
                  Luk. 19. 24. 
                  and ye shall not sée it. I passe
ouer many other plauges that Mars
threatneth vnto them, because they
will not know the time of their visitation.
               
            
            
               CHAP. 3.
               Concerning the Sicknes and
diseases of this yeare.
               THe Eygptians had a manner & vse
ni their banquets to carry about
an Image of death, and to say to euery
man that was at the Banquet, Look
                     •
                  
vppon this, eate, drinke, and be merry,
such an one shalt thou be when thou
dyest. And this they did (no doubt)
to put men in remembrance of temperance
and of death, least they vndiscreetly
through excesse of eating and

Drinking should happen to dye before
their age, for so doth God vse to punish
such sinne: wherefore if we dyet
and temper our selues, through the influence
of the Sunne we shall haue
few diseases, except Mars bring some

to whom is strife? to whom is murmuring?
to whom are woundes without

mixt Wine: and therefore he subioyneth

this counsell, looke not thou vppon the
wine when it is red, and when it sheweth
his coulour in the Cuppe, or goeth
downe pleasantly in the end, therefore,
saith he, it will bite like a Serpent, and
hurt like a Cockatrice, and thou shalt be

drunkenesse make them more insensible

There is doubtlesse a maruelous sore
punishment to come vpon the whole

disease and sicknesse that shall raigne
this yeare, as it hath done before,
Paule an auncient and true Astronomer
saith plainely, that we be all sinners,
if we say that we haue no sinne,
                  Rom. 3. 9. 
                  we deceiue
our selues,
                  Gal. 3. 22.

vs.
                  1. Iohn. 1. 8 This is now the spirituall disease
that shall commonly raigne this yeare,Iohn. 9. 39.
but especially in them that féele least of

acknowledge our sinnes,
                  1. Iohn. 1. 9 
                  hee is faithfull

clense vs from all vngodlinesse: for the
Sunne hath such vertue, that whosoeuer
can sée his disease and will complayne
of it, it shall clense them and
make them whole. Yea Paule sayeth
playnely,1. Tim. 1. 15 that Christ Iesus came into the
world to saue sinners. And Saint Iohn
giueth vs a good comfort,1. Iohn. 2. 1
                        •
                     . and saieth, if
any man sinne, we haue an aduocate with

the Father euen Iesus Christ the iust, and
he is the reconciliation for our sinnes, and
not for ours onely, but also for the sinne
                        •
                     
of the whole world. Whosoeuer therefore
hath this disease (as there is no
man without it) let him do wisely,1. Cor. 11. 28. let
him proue and examine himselfe all
times,2. Cor. 13. 5. and goe to Phisicke before he
be sore sicke,Eccles. 18. 28. and aboue all things let
him beware of such false Phisitians
& fayned Surgeons as heale the hurt
of the people with swéete words, and
say peace,Ier. 6. 14. peace, where there is none.
And as a true Astronomer reporteth,
with faire spéech and flattering,Rom. 16. 18. desceiue

he shall refresh thée,Mat. 9. 12. he shall ease thée,

If thou be hungry for righteousnes sake

                  Isay 55. 1. yea he cryes, euery one

will feed his sheepe,
                  Ezech. 34. 15

rest, though thou be lost, he will seeke
thee; though thou hast gone astray, he will
bring thee again; though thou be wounded
he will bind thee vp; though thou be
sicke and weake he will make thee whole
and strong. Seeke him therefore this
yeare and as long as thou liuest, for
with the Lord is mercy and with him is
great redemption.

he thée euer come to himselfe, he neuer
bad thée séeke other Phisitians to heale
thée of this disease:Acts. 4. 12. for there is no helpe
in the Children of men.Psal. 146. 3. As for Corporall

diseases God hath ordayned outward
medicines for them, in his creatures,
by the ministration of true Phisitians,
which gift of God no wise man
will abhorre,Eccles. 38. 1. 2. and thou art commaunded
to honour the Phisitian, with that
honour that is due vnto him, because
of necessity, for the Lord hath created
him; for of the most high commeth healing,
and he shall receiue gifts of the
King: but against the sicknes of sinne
there is no helpe or succour, but onely
in himselfe, as there is no saluation
without him, so is there euer grace,
mercy, pardon, and remission fréely in
him, for all such as will receiue it and
be thankfull for the same.

of this yeare and the cause thereof.
               THe sword that I spake of partly
in the first Chapter, is like to be
drawen this yeare; for why the
Sunne, Mars, and Mercurius cannot agrée
together; how accordeth the world

with Christ and the Gospell, they shall
neuer be at one.2. Cor. 6. 41 Sore eyes cannot abide
the cleare light of the Sunne, they
will not consent to the works of darknesse,
neither will the beléeuers haue
part with infidels, and no concord with
and betwixt Christ and Belial. Thus
can there be no agréement, for they be
of contrary natures, againe a scorner
(as Salomon saith,) loueth not him that
rebuketh him,Pro. 15. 12 the children of this
world are scornefull, and therefore are
they not content to be reformed by the
Gospell, which neuerthelesse, though
it haue many enemies, as it hath euer
had, yet because it is the truth it shall
beare away the victory, and that shortly,Reu
                        •
                     . 17. 16. 7
for God hath put into the heart of
diuers Princes to fulfill his will, and
to hate the whore of Babylon, to make
her desolate and naked, and shall eate
her flesh and burne her with fire, and
vtterly to set her out of her soyle, so that
it appeareth euidently, that Sathan
shall no more haue so great dominion,
as he hath had in times past, and now
because that he séeth that his kingdome
shall haue a fall, he worketh and shall

doe all that he can by the Children of
vnbeliefe, specially by the shauen Madianites,
Iesuites, Seminaries, excommunicate
Papists, and Catholike Romaines,
as they terme themselues, to stirre vp
warres, seditions, secret treasons,
and vtter defiances, both amongest
Princes, and Communities, for such
aduersaries of the truth doe wickedly
resiste the ordinance of God, in the authoritie
of their prince, and not submit
themselues to the Gospell. And whereas
God hath raised vp good men to
preach his word, the diuell is so mad
at it, that he hath sent them a letter of
defiance by some of his members, euen
with such an answere as was giuen to
Ieremie the prophet, for they say plainely,Ierm. 44. 16 17. 18.
                  the word that thou hast spoken to vs in
the name of the Lord, we will not heare it
of thee, but we will doe whatsoeuer thing
goeth out of our owne mouth, as to burne
incense vnto the Queene of heauen, and
to powre out drinke-offerings vnto her,
as we haue done, both we & our Fathers,
our Kings, and our Princes in the Citties
of Iuda, and in the streets of Ierusalem,
and what is our peoples saying, I pray

you? we will haue libertie of conscience

               An admonition to euery Christian,
what they ought dayly to doe, and
what to leaue vndone.
               FOrasmuch as Almighty God hath
charged by Moses, that we alwayes
should haue his Commaundements in
our sight in our minde, in our hart,
and that we should rehearse them continually
vnto our Children,
                  Deut. 6. 8. 
                  and should
talke of them when as we tarry in the
house,

                  and as we walke by the way,
and when we lye downe, and when we
rise vp, and we should binde them for a
signe vpon our hands, and they should
be as frontlets betwixt our eyes, and we

should write them vpon the posts of our
houses, and vpon your gates, to the intent
that we should not forget his
word, his will and commaundements,
and least we should follow our owne
imaginations, therefore good Christians,
I thought it fruitfull to put thée in
remembrance of thy duety, and this
could I doe no better, then by these
Godly Textes of holy Scripture,
which I haue brought héere together,
specially to the honour, la

of God, exhorting yée that yet are negligent
and forgetfull in kéeping of his
lawes, to take better hold, and goe forward
in his waies, and turne not aside,
neither to the right hand, nor to the left,
but beware of such as teach thée ought,
sauing the Doctrine of God, and that
thou mayest be sure what thou doest,
I pray Iesus Christ our onely mediatour,
obtayne for thée his holy spirit,
and giue thée a good wholesome new
yeare, with the true knowledge of his
Godly will and encrease of his faith.

to beléeue, to learne and to doe that

God hath commaunded, and so likewise
it is good to leaue vndone that
God hath forbidden. This day it is good
to learne Gods word, for it is y• vncorruptible
séed, whereof we are borne anew,
by y• word of God, it is the foode of
the soule,1. Pet. 1. 2. 3 whereby man liueth: the word
of God is quick and mighty in operation,

that heare the word of the Lord, and
keepe it, it is good to beléeue the word of
God, for he that beleeueth, and is Baptized
shalbe saued, yea God giueth them
power to be his children, that beléeue
in his name, wherefore he that cometh
vnto God must beléeue,Heb. 11. 6. 
                  for without
saith saith the Apostle, it is not possible
to please God, and what soeuer thing
is done without faith is sinne, it is
good to kéepe the word and commaundements

of God, for he that loueth me,
saith Christ,Iohn 14. 15.

and my father will loue him, and
we will come vnto him, and make our
dwelling with him, he that hath my
Commaundements and keepeth them, is
he that loueth me, and he that loueth me,
shall be loued of my father, therefor it is
good for euery one of vs to kéepe Gods
Commaundements,Exod. 20. that is, to haue no
Gods but one, to sanctifie and hallow
the name of God, to call onely vpon him
in all néede and necessitie, not to take
his name so lightly in vaine as we doe,
for no cause, and vpon a very small and
fond occasion, the which if we do, the
threatnings pronounced, that is, he shal
not be holden guiltles, that taketh his
name in vaine, that is he shall not be
vnpunished. To sanctifie the Saboth
day, namely to rest from our works, as
God did from his, to the intent that he
may worke in vs, and we to fulfill his
will by hearing his word and stedfast
faith, and prayer, to honour father and
mother, that is, to be obedient vnto
them, to helpe them in their nede, to
cherish them, to comfort them in aduersitie,

for it is acceptable and well
pleasing vnto the Lord. To do no murther,
that is to hate no man, to beare no
malice in our minds, to giue no euill
words,Mat. 5. 44. but euen to loue our enemies,
and to doe good for euill, not to commit
adultery, to breake no lawfull wedlock,
to commit no whoredome, nor vncleannesse,
but either to liue chaste, or
else to marry, to steale nothing, that is
to vse no false Merchandize, neither in
bargaining,1. Cor. 7. 1. weight, nor measure, but
truely to labour in some good calling,Ephe. 4. 28
for the sustaining of the poore, to beare
no false witnesse, that is, to hurt no
mans name nor fame to lye of no
man, but either to say the truth, or else
to kéepe silence.Ephe. 4. 25 To couet no mans
house,Rom. 7. 7. wife, seruant, goods, nor any
thting that is his, not once to lust after
our neighbours euill, but hartily to
loue him euen as our selues, and to do
vnto him after the manner, as we
would be did vnto vs, these Commaundements
it is good for vs to kéep,
not onely this day, but as long as we
liue, to the honouring of the blessed
name of God, to the increase of his
Kingdome, and to the fulfilling of his

Godly will all the dayes of thy life, it is
in good faith and stedfast beliefe to loue
thy neighbour as thy selfe, loue is the
fulfilling of the law, & loue hideth the
multitude of sinnes, loue hath many
noble conditions,Rom. 13. 10 
                  loue is patient and

Armour of light, this is the new Commaundement

                  Rom. 12. 13 
                  to feed the
hungry, to minister drinke to the thirstie,

to lodge the harbourlesse,Esai. 58. 7. to visit the
sicke,
                  Ezech. 18. 7 and shortly, to doe to euery man euen
as we would they did vnto vs. It is
good for euery one of vs to tell another
his fault, and that louingly after a brotherly
correction, without any desire of
vengeance;Leuit. 19. 17 for it is written, Thou shalt
not hate thy brother in thy heart, but
thou shalt plainely rebuke thy neighbour,
and suffer him not to sinne; Thou shalt
not auenge, nor be mindfull of wrong against
the children of thy people, but
shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe,
                  Eccles. 19. 18. and
as the wise man saith; tell thy neighbour
or friend his fault, least he be ignorant,
and say, I haue not done it, or if he
haue done it, that he do it no more. Reproue
thy neighbour that he may kéepe
his toong; and if he haue spoken any
thing amisse, that he say it no more: for
the doctrine of Christ and the Apostles
is,Gal 6. 1 
                  That if any man be fallen by occasion
into any fault,
                  Mat. 18. 15 
                  they which are spirituall,
should restore such an one with the spirit
of meekenesse, considering themselues
what is their own nature, least they also be
tempted. If thy brother trespasse against
thee, saith Christ, goe and tell him his

fault betweene him and thee alone: if he
heare thee thou hast woon thy brother,
but if he heare thee not, take yet with
thee one or two, that by the mouth of
two or three witnesses euery word may
be confirmed, and if he will not vouchsafe
to heare, then tell it vnto the Church,
and if he refuse to heare the Church also,
then let him be vnto thee as an heathen
man and a publican. Now if any that is
of the number of the brethren in Christ,
and would be taken for a Christian
man indéed, be a whoremonger or couetous,
or a worshipper of images, or a
rayler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner,
the Doctrine of Paule is plaine, that we
should not eate nor kéepe company
with such, this day it is good to be ware
of false prophets, of mens owne imaginations
and dreames, least we receiue
the poyson of Antichrists lawes, in
stéed of the blessed word of God, least
we shoote at the wrong marke, and be
deceiued by such as walke in humblenesse
of minde & worshiping of Angels,
& beware of false prophets,
                  Col. 2. 18. 
                  which come
to you in sheepes cloathing,

                  but inwardly
are rauening wolues,
                  2. Iohn 9. and whosoeuer

transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine
of Christ hath not God, he that continueth
in the doctrine of Christ, he hath
both the Father and the Sonne: If there
come any vnto you, and bring not this
Doctrine, receiue him not to house, neither
bid him God
                     •
                   spéed, for he that biddeth
him God spéed is partaker of his euill
déeds, for by false prophets the Lord our
God doth proue vs,Deut. 13 3 to know whether we
loue the Lord our God with all our heart,
and with all our soule, or not. wherefore it
shalbe good for vs, not onely this day, but
as long as we liue, to walke after the
Lord our God, and to feare him, and to
kéepe his Commandements, his statutes,
his lawes, and his constitutions, to harken
vnto his voice; to serue him, and to

                     •
                  leaue vnto him. It is good for euery subiect
to be obedient,
                  1. Pet. 2. 13 
                  and to submit himselfe
vnto all manner of ordinance of man▪ for the
Lords sake;
                  Rom 13. 1. 
                  for there is no power but of
God, and the powers that be, are ordained of
God; whosoeuer therefore resisteth the power,
resisteth the ordinance of God, & they
that resist, shall receiue to themselues iudgement,
for Princes are not to be feared for
good works, but for euill, wilt thou then be
without feare of the power, doe well, so
shalt thou haue praise of the same, for he is

the Minister of God for thy wealth; but if
thou doe euill, feare, for he beareth not the
sword for nought, for he is the minister of
God, to take vengeance on him that doth
euill, wherefore we must be subiect, not because
of wrath onely, but also for conscience
sake.
                  Prou. 16. 14 And let vs remember the saying of
Salomon, that the Kings displeasure is a
messenger of death. At is good for Kings,
Princes & temporall Iudges,Wis. 6. 3. to execute
their office as out of the power that God
ministreth vnto them, for in very déede
the power is giuen them of the Lord, and
the strength from the highest, therefore
séeing they a

iudgement, to kéepe the law of righteousnesse,
to walke after his will, to loue the
light of wisedome, to expell Southsayers,
Charmers, expounders of dreames, Idols,
Masses, and all abominations out of
their land, to set vp the words of the law
of God, to put downe the houses of Idolatry,
and to sée that the law & word of God
be taught among the people, to spare neither
cost nor labour for the maintenance
and defence of the same, to séeke the peace,
wealth & prosperity of their Commons,

                  to iudge euery man righteously without any
wresting of the law,
                  Deut. 1 15 
                  to know no mans
person in iudgement, to take no gifts, but euer
to haue the lawes of God, and to doe
thereafter by them, and to reade therein all
the dayes of their liues, that they may learne
to feare the Lord their God, and to keepe
all the words of his law, and to doe thereafter,
that his hart be not lifted vp aboue his
brethrē, that he may prolong his daies in his
kingdome. It is good for seruants to be obedient
vnto them that are their Maisters, according
to the flesh,
                  Ephes. 6. 5. 
                  with feare and trembling,
with singlenes of their harts,
                  Col. 3. 22. 
                  as vnto
Christ,
                  Tit. 2. 9. 
                  not with seruice to the eye, as men
pleasers,
                  Pet. 2. 18. 
                  but as the seruants of Christ, doing
the will of God from the hart. &c. as also
Peter: Seruants be subiect to your Maisters
with all feare, not only to the good & courteous,
but also to the froward. And therfore
was Saint Paul so earnest to sée this
ordinance of God kept,Tim. 6. 
                        •
                     . namely, that as
many seruants as are vnder the yoake, should
count their Maisters worthy of all honour,
that the name of God and of his doctrine be
not euill spoken of. It is good for such men
as haue s
                     •••
                  ants,Ephes. 6. 8. 
                  to put away threatnings
doing vnto their seruants that which
is iust and equall, and know that they also

themselues haue a Maister in heauen, and
vse the counsell of the wiseman, whereas
thy seruant worketh truely,Eccles. 7. intreat him
not euill, nor the hireling that bestoweth
himselfe for thée, let thy soule loue a discréete

                  e owne soule, defraud
him not of his libertie, neither
leaue him a poore man, & if he be not obedient,
bind his féete, but be not excessiue
toward any, and without discretion doe
nothing, therefore should euill seruants
be corrected, séeing they will not be the
better for words, for though they vnderstand
them, yet will they not regard thē:
tame thy euill seruant with hands and
correction, If you set him to labour, you
shall find rest,Pro. 29. 21. but if you let him goe idle, he
shall séeke libertie, for as Salomon saith, he
that delicatly bringeth vp his seruant from
his youth, at length he wilbe euen as his
Sonne. It is good for women to be obedient,
and to submit themselues vnto their
husbands, as vnto the Lord, for the husband
is the wiues head,
                  Ephes. 5. 22 
                  euen as Christ
also is the head of the Church, and
the same is the Sauiour of his body, therefore
as the Church is in subiection to Christ,
euen so let the wiues be vnto their husbands
in euery thing, as it is comely in the Lord,
that euen they which obey not the word,

may without the word,Col. 13. 18. be woon by the conuersation
of their wiues,1. Pet. 3. 1. while they behold
their pure con
                        •
                     ersation which is with feare,
and let not their appareling be vntoward,
as with brodered haire, & Gold, put about
thē, or in putting on of apparrell, but let
the hid man of the hart be vncorrupt, with
a méeke and quiet spirit, which is before
God a thing much set by, for euen after
this manner did the holy women, which
trusted in God, tyre themselues, & were
subiect to their husbands, as Sarah obeyed
Abraham and called him Lord:Gen. 18. 12 it is good
for men to loue their wiues, euen as
Christ loued the Church, and gaue himselfe
for it, that he might sanctifie it and
cleanse it by washing of water, thorough
the word,Ephe. 5. 
                        •
                     5 
                  that he might make it vnto himselfe
a glorious Church, not hauing spot or
wrinckle, or any such thing, but that it
should be holy and without blame, so ought
men to loue their wiues as their owne
bodies, he that loueth his wife, loueth himselfe,
for no man yet euer hated his owne

euery man to doe, so that he loue his wife
euen as himselfe,Col. 3. 19. 
                  and not to be bitter vnto
them, but to dwell with them as men of

knowledge, giuing honour vnto them as vnto
the weaker vessell, euen as they that are
heires together of the grace of life, that
your prayers be not interrupted.Ephes. 6. 1. 
                  It is
good for childrē to obey their parents in the
Lord,
                  Col. 3. 20. 
                  for that is right and well pleasing vnto
the Lord, yea the Lord will haue the
father honoured of the Children, and hath
confirmed the authority of the mother ouer
the children.Eccles. 3. 4. 
                  He that honoreth his mother
is like one that gathereth treasure, whoso
honoureth his Father shall haue ioy of
his owne children, and when he maketh
his prayer, he shalbe heard, he that honoureth
his father shall haue long life, and
he that is obedient to the Lord shall comfort
his mother: he that feareth the Lord
honoureth his parents, and doth seruice vnto
his parents as vnto the Lord, honour thy
father and mother in deed and word, and in
all patience, that thou mayest haue Gods
blessing, for the blessing of the father establisheth
the house of the Children, and the
mothers curse rooteth out the foundations:
reioyce not at the dishonour of thy father,
for it is not honour vnto thee, but shame,
seeing that mans glory cometh by his Fathers
honour, and the reproach of the mother
is dishonour to the children, helpe thy

father in his age, and grieue him not as long
as he liueth, and if his vnderstanding faile,
haue patience with him, and despise him not,
when thou art in thy full strength, for the
good entreaty of thy father shall not be forgotten,
he that forsaketh his father shall
come to shame, and he that angreth his
mother is cursed of God. My Sonne performe
thy duty with louing meeknes, and
so shalt thou be beloued of them that are
approued:Ephes. 6. 4. It is good for fathers not to prouoke
their children to wrath,Col. 321. but to bring
them vp in instruction and information of
the Lord: for as the wiseman saith, whoso

deliuer his soule from hell.1. Tim. 3. 2. It is good for euery
one that is a Bishop or other spirituall
Shepheard to be vnreproueable, the husband

of sinne, and redéeme the time, as
saith the Apostle for the dayes are euill,
and learne yee to be sober, to watch, to
fast, and to pray, and to be ready with the
wise Uirgins to enter in with the Bridegroome
into our Maisters ioy, which
shall neuer be taken from vs, and
shall endure for euer and
euer. Amen.
