               ABSTINENCE.
               WYne and youth is a double flame of carnall desire.
                     Hieroni.
                  
               
               That man seldom falleth into things vnlefull whiche in thinges lefull can sometime refraine.
                     Gregoriꝰ.

               Nature is cōtent with a few things and littell, whose contentacion if thou doest oppresse with excesse, that whiche thou eatest, shall be vnto the vnpleasāt and hurtfull.
                     Seneca.

               ADVERSITIE,
               THe potters vessell is tryed in the furnes, and good men be proued in time of aduersitie.
                     Salomon.
                  
               
               Hyde thy misfortune, that thine ennemiereioyce net.
                     Periander
                  
               
                There is nothinge so greuous, but an vpright mynd may finde therin solace.
                     Seneca.
                  
               
                In all thy troubles remember this reason, hard things may be mollified, streicte things may be lowsed, & heauy things shall little greue them that can handsomly beare it.
                     Seneca.
                  
               
                Trouble is cause of pacience: pacience maketh profe: profe bringeth in hope: hope is neuer rebuked.
                     Paulus.
                  
               
               My chylde neglect not gods correction, but when he doth punishe thee, thinke it not tedious, for whom god loueth, him will he chastice.
                Coles beynge in the forge, do burne and consume, but the golde is there tried: the one is tourned to ashes, while the other is fyned.
                     Augusti.
                  
               
               The forge is the worlde, good men are the golde, aduersitie is the fyre, the workeman is god.
                It pertaineth to vertue, to suffer aduersitie: it belongeth to wisdome in aduersitie alway to be mery: plucke vp thy hert and suffer goddes pleasure, for the chief

                     Bernard.
                  
               
               
                  The wise man in tourments is euermore
happy.
                     Lactantiꝰ.
                   But he that is troubled either for faithe or iustice, or for god almightie, that sufferance of peyne bryngeth a man to perfecte felicitie.

                     Seneca.
                  
               
            
            
               AFFECTION.
               VUhere affection ones in the herte of man entreth, and floweth into his breast, and drowneth his hert, fidelitee, vertue, good fame, & honestee him cleane forsaketh, and he daily in all mischiefe increaseth.

               Where affection aboundeth, there good fame & vertue oftētimes perisheth.
                     Euripides
                  
               
            
            
               AMBICION.
               THey that be infected with ambicion and are desirous of honour, would be exhorted to possede onely suche treasure as is vnspotted, and cleane from all mischiefe, whiche may not of any annemy be corrupted, nor with rebuke noted, nor with any dishonestie sclaundered.

               The diuell did fal onely because he rather wold be a lorde then a subiecte.
                     Augusti.
                  
               
               
                   He that is in auctoritie, let him consider how he commeth to it, & comming well to it, how he ought to liue well in it: & liuing wel in it, how he muste gouerne: and gouerninge wisely, he must oft call to remembraunce his owne infirmitee.
                     Gregoriꝰ
                  
               
               A vertuous man should receiue rule or auctoritee, as if he were therto compelled: but he that lacketh vertu, though he be cōpelled, yet let him not take it.
                Ambition is a subtill mischiefe: a priuie poyson, a couert pestilence, the forger of deceite, the mother of hypocrisie, the nourice of enuie, the foūtaine of vices, the mouth of deuocion, the blinder of hertes, making diseases of remedies, and sickenes of salues.
                     Bernard.
                  
               
                It is hard for him that desireth to be aboue all men, to kepe alwaie equitie, which is the chiefe parte of iustice.
                     Tullius.
                  
               
               He that is desirous of glory, is soone stirred to do thinges against equitie.
            
            
               AVTHORITIE.
                HYgh authoritie is alway in perill. For it is hard to holde that, which thou canst not welde.

                  They that wolde excell all other in a citie or countrey, should allure their inferiours with indifferencie, gentilnesse and liberalitee: And content great mē with diligence, affabilitie, and sobrenesse, & with good reasons reteine them in the weale publik

                     Augusti.
                  
               
               Amitie either taketh or maketh men equal, and where inequalitie is, by pre-eminence of the one, and much basenes of the other, there is much more flattery than friendshippe.
                     Hieronimus.
                  
               
               In amitie the thing is not so muche to be sought for, as the wil and intent, the one betwene men is oftentimes geuen, the other onely procedeth of loue, and the same thinge to will or will not, is constant amitie.

               That is true friendshippe, that loketh for nothing of his friend, but onely his fauour, as who saieth, without meede, loueth his louer.

               In things most prosperous the counsell of friendes is moste to be vsed.

               The right apparaile of christen men and women, is in no manner of deceitful painting and trimminge, nor yet the pompous apparaile & iewels, but it is theyr good condicions and maners.

               A woman if she haue soueraintie, is to hir husbande frowarde and contrary.
               Geue not to the water that serueth thy house neuer so little an issue: nor to an illwife licence to wander.
               A constant wife reioyceth hir husband, & in peace shal prolong the terme of his lyfe. A stedfast woman is a golden pyller set on baces of syluer.
            
            
               VAYNEGLORIE.
               LEt vs not be desirouse of vaineglory, one prouokynge the other with mutuall enuie.
                     Paulus.
                  
               
               The vaineglory of this worlde is a deceiteful swetenes, an vnfruitful labour, a continual feare, a daungerous aduācement, a beginnyng without prouidence, an ende without repentance.
                     Augustin
                  
               
               There is not so much ioy in high climyng vpwarde, as there is sorowe in fallyng harde downewarde, no so much renoume after victory, as after ruine reproche of foly.

               What shoulde he that is stronge, auaunt of his strength, whom bodily sicknesse bringeth to feblenesse?
               What should tht riche man auaunt of his riches, whose hope by a thefe or a tyranne is soone disapointed?
            
            
               VIRGINITEE.
               VIrginitee is sister of aungelles, vāquisher of lustes, prices of vertues, possessour of good thinges.

                     Paulus.
                  
               
                What profiteth a whole bodie with a minde corrupted? Better is an humble matrimony than a proude virginitie.
                     Augustin
                  
               
                A maidens speache wolde be circumspecte, sober and selde: not so excellente in elloquence as in bashfulnes. Whan thou speakest, let men meruaile at thy shamefastnes: whan thou speakest not, let them wonder at thy wisedome and sobrenesse.

               VVRATH.
                A Foole immediatli discouereth his anger, he that hideth his iniurie, is wise and craftie.
                     Salomon.
                  
               
               An angry person prouoketh contencion, but he that is paciene, appeaseth debate when it is stirred.
               Be not familiar with a man ful of anger, nor kepe not company with a furious person, least thou learne his waies, and cause the soule therby to offende.
                Let euery man be swifte in herynge, slowe in speche, & slowe in displeasure.
                     Iacobus.
                  
               
                By wrathe, wisedome is lost, so that it can not appere, what shoulde be done,nor how it ought to be done.
                     Gregoriꝰ.
                  
               
               The chiefe remedy of angre is delaye, that the furie maie abate, and the darkenesse that maketh witte blinde, may decay, or at the least w
