      
         
            
            A greatter thanks, for Churchyardes
welcome home.
            
               
                  I Bad not Courte farewell
               for such hot welcome home,
               But glad to leaue the costly Courte
               and lyue lyke cuntrye mome.
            
            
               ¶From thence I wyllyng went:
               and thought in very deed,
               To make (ere mischeefs fel on heapes)
               a Uertue of a need.
            
            
               ¶But my cheeff freend came there,
               to whome for duties sake
               I rode, and did (by destinies lot)
               a further iourney make.
            
            
               ¶Which freend drew me by loue,
               to see the Courte agayne:
               But sens my suddayn comming there
               doth breed in you disdayne:
            
            
               I fynd more fumish flames,
               by this fond frantike smoke:
               And see (perhaps) a further fyer,
               then you with craft can cloke.
            
            
               ¶But tyll your fyngers burne,
               ye care not what ye doe:
               Well, I wyll helpe to kyndle coales,
               and clap on faggots toe.
            
            
               ¶To bryng your handes in heat,
               because the ayre is colde:
               Ka. me: Knaue thee: I say no more,
               the prouerbe is full olde.
            
            
               ¶Yf Crowes of Cheape cry Ka,
               the bawle doth backe rebound:
               For sure I owe not all their towne,
               the halfe of twentie pound.
            
            
               ¶And thyrteene candels great,
               o euery pound allowe:
               Then call an audite of my debt,
               and cast my charges nowe.
            
            
               ¶Yet know I cut tayld Curres,
               can neuer byght in frame:
               Tyll courage claps them on the backs
               and thrusts them on the game.
            
            
               ¶Come on you snarryng whelpes
               I feare your force no whit:
               Though lowd ye bark ye dare not byte
               your teeth are tender yet.
            
            
               ¶Baight me lyke Bull at stake,
               I haue good flesh and bone:
               To trie it out (as hap shall serue)
               with any Dog a lone.
            
            
               ¶No other aunswer sure,
               I make: now skan this well:
               But leaue the Lob that rayld on me,
               the bable and the bell.
            
            
               *Write not to this agayne,
               in silence shall ye sit:
               As voyde of aunswer euery way,
               as you are voyd of wyt.
            
            ¶FINIS.
