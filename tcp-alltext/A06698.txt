For I thought although I were poore & not of habilite to make

So shoulde they haue Christe more present wyth them at theyr feastes,

And whan he hath this done, immediately he exorteth vs to good workes, saienge that we are the workemanship of God, created in Christ Iesu vnto good workes, which God hath prepared ye we should walke in them. Here maye ye learne, what is your duety to do vnto God agayn, seing that he frely thorowe sayth hath saued you withoute any merites, deseruynges or good dedes on your behalfe.What the duty of y• fayth

of good workes. Also ī another place he sayeth, God gyueth to thē whom he choseth without merites, whereof they maye be garnysshed with merites also.Marke this well. And it is not truely sayde, that the entent and determinacion of wel workyng is not in the electe. For the gyftes of vertues cā not beydle. Thus se you that lynysh fayth whereby ye are ingrassed in Christe, brynge the forth good workes. Neyther is true repentāce, syncer faith, vnfayned loue in you, yf good & christen workes do not followe your conuersion. Yea they that bost of fayth and brynge not forth the workes of fayth, derogate muche the glorye of fayth, & cause the true and christian fayth to be slaundered & yll reported amonge thē which neuer tasted, nor yet at ony tyme in theyr hertes felte what a precious thyng, and of howe great strength effycacy & power, the syncere faythe is. Therfore yf youre

fayth be not accōpanied wyth good workes, youre fayth is dead, as S. Ia. fayeth,

               Therfore is a faythfull man compared in y• first Psalme to a tree, which is planted by the waters syde, & bringeth forth her fruytes in due tyme. I am the true vyne,Ioan. xv. sayeth Christ, & ye are the braunches. He that abydeth in me, & I in hī,

                  geth for the plenty of good workes.

                         of gods words. Ye se that theyse aduersaries of Gods worde haue no other pleasure than to haue an occasion both to blaspheme the worde, and also the earneste fauourers of it. Behold, say they, are these Gospellers? Are these professours of gods word? Are theyse they yt mayntayne Gods trueth? Perysshe mought they with theyr Gospell. For they wyl not fast nor praye, nor gyue almes, nor vse any kynde of vertue. Theyse, whome they cal Pharises, do much excel thē in euery degree of godly lyuynge. They wyll shewe themselues conformable to no poletyke ordinaunce. They hunte carnall libertie. They seke to synne freely and without punysshemente. Theyr whole religion consisteth in breakynge mens lawes and auncient customes. Farewell they therfore with theyr gospel. We wyll followe our forefathers. This and such lyke talke is hearde dayely

amonge the enemies of Gods word. Therfore oughte they yt loue Gods trueth to walke circūspectly, seyng the dayes are euell,Ephe. v. as S. Paule saieth, & to haue an honest conuersaciō amonge Goddess enemies, that they which backbyte them as euell doers, maye se theyr good workes, & prayse God in the day of visitacion. For so is the wyll of God,i. Petre. ii. sayeth S. Peter that with wel doynge ye should stop the mouthes of ygnoraunt men, as free, & not as though ye toke lyberty for a cloke of maliciousnes, but euen as the seruaūtes of God. Which thyng (moost dere brothers) woulde God ye would do, that by your vertuous conuersacion ye myghte not plucke men from, but vnto the Gospell, not dishonour but honour god, not hynder but prouoke the Euangelical trueth, that with one mynd, herte, wyl, tonge & dede we al might togyther professe one God and one

trueth. Than should God be glorified among vs. Thā should his moost blessed worde be enhalsed of all men. Than shoulde we vnder one kynge liue ī an vnite, peace & cōcord of christen religion, without ony scisme, he resy or dissencion.Roma. v. Gala. ii. Than myghte we well saye, that the true repentaūce and syncer fayth, wherby a christen man is iustified in the syght of God were in vs. For so longe as we continue ī our old wickednes, & amēd not our maners, certes neyther true repentaunce, nor christen faythe is in vs, and to saye the trueth, neyther haue we ony parte of Christ or Christes merytes, but pertayne styll to Satan & his synfull synagoge. For as S. Iohn sayeth:i. Ioan. 
                           •
                        . If we saye, that we haue fellowshyp with God, & yet walke in darknes, we lye & performe not the trueth. But & if we walke in lyghte, euen as he is in lyghte, than haue we fellowship wt him, & ye bloud

of Iesus Christ his sōne, maketh vs cleane frō all synne.Roma. xiii. 
                           •
                        itum. ii. Therfore (dearely beloued) let vs cast away the workes of darkenes, walke in the lyghte of Gods trueth, lyue accordynge to our vocacion, garnysh the doctryne of christ our sauiour with godly maners, & so in al pointes institute and order our lyfe accordyng to Goddes wyll, that we maye be that same in lyfe & dede, that we desyre to be reported, that is to say, perfecte & true christen men both in herte, worde, & dede. So maye we be certayne in this lyfe to haue God a mercyfull father vnto vs thorowe Iesus Christ his sonne, & after the departing out of this world to enioye the glorious syght of the moost blessed Godhead, & there to remayne in ioye & glorye, worldes without ende. Amē. Thus endeth your bancket.
