Anno. Dom. 1598.
               
               
                  
                  
                  To the valorous and
noble minded Gentleman,
Captaine Iohn Sammes, Esquire:
F. M. hartily wisheth
in this life, the health, yeeres, &
happines, of Galen, Nestor, and
Augustus, and in the other, the
delight, rest, and ioy, of Abraham,
Isaac, and
Iacob.
                  THere bee three thinges
(Right worshipful) greatlie
desired in this lyfe,
Health, VVealth, & Fame:
& it is a question which of these
is cheefe; the sicke sayth Health,
the couetous commendeth
VVealth, and both these place
good name last of all. But they be
both partiall Iudges, because
Health & VVealth, though they
be neuer so good, and so great,
end with the body, and are subiect
to time. But honour, fame,
renowne, and good report, doe

tryumph ouer death, and make
men liue for euer:
Nunquā stigias fertur ad vmbras
Inclyta virtus.
                  
                  
                     Immensum calcar gloria habet;
there is not a greater inticement
vnto vertue, then Fame & true
glory:
Spes famae solet ad virtutem
impellere multos.
                  
                  This made Alexander in honor
of armes to emulate Achilles,
Scipio Africanus to imitate Xenophons
Cyrus, Caesar to patterne
himselfe by Alexander, Selimus
Prince of Turkes to trace
the steps of Caesar, and Carolus
Quintus to fire his thoughts at
Philip Cominaeus his Lodouicus
xi. King of Fraunce. Proceede
(noble and heroyick Spirite)
with young Troylus to
ayme at Hectors glory. And as
the pregnancie of your Hopes

promiseth to be an Huniades to
the Turkes, a Talbot to the
French, and a Drake to the Spanyard;
so also bee an Artaxerxes
to Hippocrates, an Alexander to
Pindarus and Aristotle, a Scipio
to Ennius, an Augustus to Virgil,
a Traian to Plutarch, and a
Mecaenas to all Schollers. And
then as the sworde dooth defend
the penne of the Scholler, so the
penne shal grace the sword of the
Souldiour; & shall tunablie sonnet
that paracleticall verse out of
Horace:
Dignum laude virum Musa
vetat mori.
                  
                  Learning indeede vvould bee
soone put to silence, without the
ayde & support of noble, bountifull,
and generous spirits. In
hope of which ayde and supportation,
I present these diuine and
celestiall meditations vnto your
VVorship, which, vnder the title
of your protection, may doe as

much good in England, as they
haue done in Spayne, Portugall,
Italy, Fraunce, and Germanie.
Lodouicus Granatensis the Authour
of these heauenly and spyrituall
Meditations, hath so cunningly
portrayed in this Treatise
the myseries and calamities
of this lyfe, and with such diuine
eloquence depainted the future
blessednes of the other, that for
stile hee seemes to mee another
Cicero, and for sounde and emphaticall
perswasion, a second
Paule. VVhose diuine spirit, &
heauenly writing, as it hath moued
the Italians Camillus Camilli,
Georgius Angelierus, Timotheus
Bagnus, & Iohannes Baptista Porcacchius
to translate his works into
theyr language, and Michael
of Isselt, to conuert thē into Latine,
& Philippus Doberniner into
the Germaine tongue, so also
hath it mooued me, to digest thē
into English; that nowe at the

length our Country might enioy
that rare Iewel, vvhich those
famous Countries doe so highly
prize. For further commendation
of the Authour and thys
Booke, I referre your VVorship
to the present discourse, which I
assure my selfe will worke those
motions in you, that it shal neyther
yrke you of your paines, nor
mee of my labour. Thus boldlie
presuming on your curteous acceptation,
I commit you to hys
sacred protection, who graceth
heere vpon the earth the memories
of the valiant and vertuous
by the pennes of Schollers, and
glorifieth them in heauen, with
his chosen men of vvarre, who
with Iosua haue fought his battailes,
and with Dauid haue vnsheathed
their swords to auenge
his quarrell. London the 24. of
Nouember. 1598.

                  THE
Prologue, and a briefe
manner of Meditation.
                  
                     ALl thinges passe
away, except the
loue of GOD.
Whē as the wise
man had contemplated,
and by long experience
learned the mutabilitie
of all things, neither had found
any constancie, or certainelie
very little, in any thing created
in this world, but many desires,
& an vnsatiable thirst of men,
which violently forced them,
to hunt after these transitorie
things; at length he cryeth out.
Vanity of vanities,Eccles, 1. all is vanity &

affliction of spirit. And when he
had runne thorow, and experimēted
all things in the world,
with a most wholesome councell
he concludeth his disputation,
Eccle. 12. saying; Remember thy
Creator in the dayes of thy youth,
whiles the euill dayes come not, nor
the yeeres approch, wherein thou
shalt say, I haue no pleasure in
them: whiles the Sun is not dark,
nor the light, nor the Moone, nor
the starres, nor the clowdes returne
after the raine. Feare God
and keepe his commaundements:
for this is the whole dutie of man.
And because the whole safety
of our soules, and all our blessednes
dependeth of this councell,
it is most aptly and fitlie
spoken of S. Gregory; That
there is no such sacrifice offered
to the Almightie, as the
zeale of the soule is: vvhich
sheweth by vvholesome doctrines

the vvay vnto celestiall
glory. I beeing therefore moued
by this zeale, although vnworthy
to teach, haue gathered
this short tractate out of
diuers authorities of holy doctors,
that a soule drowned in
the pollution of sinne, beeing
conuicted by these instructions
& authorities of holy men,
and enlightned of the holie
Ghost, might bee reduced to
her Creator and Redeemer, as
a straying and lost sheepe, or at
the length might know her estate,
and the errors and daungers,
which she in this vvorld
is in, whilst shee continueth in
sinne, and being touched with
the sorrow of contrition, might
returne vnto God, and returning,
might bring forth repentance,
and repenting, might
possesse with al the Saints, glorie
and celestiall beatitude, to

the which shee was made and
created. But to this there is no
other way, then that, of which
the Prophet speaketh: This is
the way,Esay, 30, walke yee in it, neyther
shall yee decline to the right hand,
nor to the left.
                  
                  Therefore it is needfull for
a Christian man, that is vvilling
after thys wretched life to
goe to his desired home, besides
prayers and common exercises,
to vse also diligēce, that
his hart may bee lifted vp vnto
God, not onely in euery place,
but also that at all times, and in
all businesses, hee may carrie about
with him cogitations, seriously
imployed about religious
& godly contemplations.
As a Bee delighted vvith the
beautie of colours,A similie. and sweetnes
of odours, doth take somewhat
from euery flower, and
dooth carry it to her hiue, to

make honey of it: so it is requisite
that the seruant of God
should take of all things created,
which are presented vnto
his minde, as it were certaine
spurrs pricking forwards vnto
deuotion, and to the loue of
God, meditating on them in
his hart, with great delight with
out intermission.
                  By this endeuour, at the
length vvee shall bring it to
passe, that vppon the alter of
our harts there shall alvvayes
burne, the fire of diuine loue,
wee beeing alwayes busied in
godly prayers, and deuout meditations.
                  Therefore in the morning,What wee are to do in the morning.
as soone as wee awake, let vs
shut our gates against al earthlie
and worldly thoughts, that
so before all things, our Lorde
may enter in and haue admittance;
let vs offer vnto him the

                     
                        〈1 page duplicate〉
                     
                     
                     
                        〈1 page duplicate〉
                     
                     
first fruites of that day, & conferring
with him, let vs doe
three things.
                  First, giue him thanks for the
rest hee hath giuen thee that
night, and that he hath deliuered
thee from al perrillous and
feareful fantasies, and from the
snares of thine enemy; and for
all other benefites, of creation,
preseruation, vocation, and redemption:
that he hath called
thee to his fayth, that hee hath
infused into thee good inspyrations,
that he hath freed thee
from all danger, that so long a
time, with so great patience &
mercy hee hath waited for thy
repentance. And to be briefe,
yeelde vnto him most hartie
thanks for all blessings whatsoeuer.
                  Then offer vnto him whatsoeuer
that day thou shalt eyther
doe or suffer; all thy lalabours,

all thy stepps, all thine
exercises, and briefely, all that
which thou art to doe, or to be
imployed in that day. Offer
vnto him in like manner, thy
selfe, with all thine, that al may
redound to his glorie, that hee
may haue a hand in all, and dispose
of all, as it shall please his
most holy, will, none otherwise
then if they were his owne businesses.
                  Thirdly, desire his fauour &
grace, that thou mayst not cō
                     mitt
any thing that day, that
shall be contrarie to his diuine
maiestie. Beseech him that he
vvoulde ayde thee against all
sinnes, and especially against
those, which customarily thou
art most inclined to, as are anger,
vaine glory, dissolutnes in
wordes, and such like: arming
thy selfe with a firme resolution
against all kind of vices.
                  
                     At night,What we are to doe at night. before thou goest
to bed, examine thy selfe with
iudgement, and call to minde,
whatsoeuer thou hast that day
either done, spoken, or thought
against the diuine will: and recall
all thy negligences, idlenes,
& slothfull heauines, about the
diuine seruice & worship, and
that so wickedly thou hast forgotten
thy Lord God.
                  Desire God, that hee would
pardon all thine errors, & forgiue
all the sinnes which thou
hast committed, and that hee
would bestowe his grace vpon
thee, that thou mayst correct
and amend thy life. And when
thou layest thy selfe downe in
thy bed, thinke how thou shalt
lie in thy graue; & cōsider with
thy selfe how small a coffin wil
cōtaine thy body, & end all thy
meditations with that prayer,
which Christ himselfe taught

his disciples.
                  As often as thou awakest in
the night,What we are to doe when the houre soū
                        deth. say, Glory be to the
Father, and to the Sonne, &c.
Or some such like thing, & as
often as thou hearest the sound
of the howre, say; Blessed be
the howre in which our Lorde
Iesus Christ was borne and died
for vs; ô Lorde remember
mee in the howre of my death.
And consider howe thy life is
shorter by an hower then it
was before, and howe by little
and little, thy web is wouen-vp
and ended.
                  VVhen thou sittest downe
to eate,What we are to doe when wee sit at meate. or risest vp from the table,
alwayes remember the example
of our Lorde; lift-vp
thine hart vnto thy GOD, &
cōsider that it is he, that giueth
thee meate and drinke, vvho
hath created all things for thy
vse: render vnto him thankes

for the foode hee sendeth thee,
and ponder with thy selfe how
many men almost perrishe
through hunger and vvant,
then which thine estate is farre
happier; remember with what
ease and safety thou possessest
those things, which others can
hardly compasse with great
danger and labour.
                  When thou art impugned
or molested of the deuill that
auntient Tempter, the best remedie
is, if thou runnest vnto
the Crosse, and beholde hanging
vpon it Iesus Christ, cruellie
scourged, crovvned vvith
thornes, racked vpō the crosse,
hauing neyther beauty nor cō
                     linesse,
riuolets of precious
bloode gushing out of his bodie.
Rembember that the chiefest
cause, why thy Lord hangeth
there, is none other, then
that hee might destroy the

kingdome of sinne. Beseech
and intreate him with great deuotion,
that hee would not suffer
a thing so odious to raigne
in thine heart, or in thine eyes,
which he with so great cost &
labour banished & destroyed;
and say, ô my Lord, thou hangest
heere vpon the crosse, that
I might not sinne: and shall
not this be sufficient for mee,
that I may flie from sinne?A prayer against tēptations. I
beseech thee, ô lorde, by those
thy most holy wounds, suffer
me not at any time to bee forsaken
of thee, when I come vnto
thee; yea ô lord, shew vnto,
mee the best hauen, vvhere I
may be in most safetie.
                  If thou shalt reiect & refuse
me, whether shall I goe? what
shall I doe? what will become
of me? who shall defend mee?
ô my lorde, helpe mee, & defend
me from that dragon, seeing

that without thee I can doe
nothing.
                  If thou shalt feruently thus
persist in heartie and earnest
prayer, the temptations shalbe
an occasion of a nobler crown,
and they shall bring it to passe,
that thy minde shall bee oftner
lifted vp to God, and the deuil
who came with hope of victorie,
shall beeing vanquished,
most shamefully flie away. Among
all these exercises, the
sighes and gronings of the spirite
are most commendable,
which are tokens of vehement
desires, by the which the soule
beeing preuented of the holie
Ghost, and wounded vvith the
loue of God, sigheth, & groneth,
and with great feruencie
laboureth for the loue of God,
and so desireth this loue, both
with great instancie, and without
intermission.
                  
                     This meditation, & this holy
exercise is so profitable, that
if it be daily done, or be vsed at
meale times, at drinking times,
in going, or labouring, oftentimes
is of greater dignity and
efficacy, then other prolixe exercises,
or copious prayers.
                  This exercise is more profitably
done by desires and inward
sighings and mournings,
then by words: albeit wordes
helpe at al times; which a man
may now and then vtter after
this, or such like manner.
                  O blessed Iesu, ô the sweetnes
and delight of my hart:A Prayer, ô
the life of my soule, when shall
I please thee in all things and
at all times? When shall I perfectly
dye vnto my selfe? Whē
shall I preferre thee before all
creatures? When shall there
not liue any other thing in mee
besides thy selfe ô Lord? Haue

mercy vpon me ô Lord, and
helpe me. I salute thy wounds
ô Lord, as it were fresh flourishing
roses, hide me ô lord in
them, and wash mee in them,
that I may be throghly cleane,
and inflamed with thy loue. O
Lord God, ô admirable beginning,
ô the piety of amiable
charity; ô the dearest light of
my vnderstanding; ô the rest
of my vvill, vvhen shall I feruently
and ardently loue thee?
Vouchsafe ô lord to shoote
through my soule vvith the
dart of thy loue, vouchsafe to
associate and vnite mee vnto
thee, that I may bee one vvith
thee. O my desire: ô my hope:
ô my refreshing and comfort.
O that my soule were worthy
thyne embraces, that all the
drowsines and luke-warmnes
of my soule, might be consumed
with the fire of thy loue.

O the soule of my soule: ô the
life of my life, I wholy desire
thee, and offer my selfe wholy
vnto thee, wholy to thee that
art all in all, one to one, and only
to thee alone. O that it had
place in me, that thou spakest
to thy Father; O holy Father,
let them be one, as wee are one.Iohn. 17. I
in them, and thou in me, that they
may be made perfect in one.
                  
                  I neyther will nor wish any
other thing, I desire none other
thing, I entreate none other
thing of thee; for thou alone
art sufficient for me. Thou
art my father, thou art my mother,
thou art my defender, my
leader, and all my good. Thou
art wholy louely, vvholy delightfull,
wholy faithfull. Who
was euer so liberall that would
giue him selfe? vvho euer loued
so tenderly, that would deliuer
himselfe vnto death for a

vile creature? Who vvas euer
so humble, that hath so debased
and ecclipsed his Maiesty?
O Lorde, thou despisest no
man, disdaynest no man, reiectest
no man, that sueth vnto
thee: yea, thou callest and prouokest
them to come & meete
thee; for it is thy delight to
conuerse with the children of
men.
                  O Lorde, the Angells doe
blesse and prayse thee, what other
thing hast thou found in
vs, but pollutions and blemishes
of sin? Wherefore wouldest
thou be with vs to the end
of the vvorld? Was it not enough
for thee, that thou sufferedst
for vs, but that thou
must leaue thy Sacraments for
a medicine vnto vs, and thy
Angells for our companions
and protectours? And albeit
we be vnthankfull for so great

benefites, yet thou wouldest
dwell among vs, for thou art so
good and gracious, that thou
canst not deny thy selfe.
                  Therfore ô Lord let vs make
(if so it please thee) a league &
couenant: take thou charge
of me, and I will take charge of
thee. Doe with me ô Lord, as
it pleaseth thee: for thou knowest
what I want, and what is
meete for mee: I will be thine,
and no others. Giue me grace
ô Lord, that I may not seeke
nor desire any thing, but thee:
and that I may wholy offer &
yeeld vp my selfe vnto thee.
                  O sire, that enlightenest me:
ô charity, that inflamest me:
ô light illuminating me: ô my
rest: ô my life: ô my loue, who
alwayes burnest, and neuer art
extinguished: vvhen shall I
perfectly loue thee? When
shall I embrace thee with the

naked arms of my soule? Whē
shall I despise my selfe and the
whole vvorld, for the loue of
thee? When shall my soule
with al her powers & strength
bee vnited vnto thee? When
shall I be swallowed vp in the
bottomles depth of thy loue?
O thou most sweete, most louing,
most beautifull, most
wise, most rich, most noble,
most precious, and most worthy
to be loued and worshipped,
when shall I so loue thee,
that I may lie drowned wholy
in thy loue? O the life of my
soule, who didst vndergoe the
burthen of death, that thou
mightest reuiue me, and dying
didst kill death: kill ô Lord me
also, that is, slay all my peruerse
inclinations to euill; my will
also, and whatsoeuer hindereth,
whereby thou mayst not liue
with mee. But after that thou

hast thus killed me, make me
to liue with thee, by loue, and a
true faith: that I may faithfully
obserue all thy commaundements,
and the precepts of
my superiours, and that I may
only prosecute & follow those
things, that are of the spirit.
                  O most bountifull and gracious
Iesu, giue me a perfect
hatred and loathing of sinne;
and a perfect cōuersion of hart
vnto thee, that all my thoughts,
and all my desires may be busied
and conuersant in thee alone,
and about thee alone. O
life. vvithout which I dye; ô
truth, without which I am deceaued:
ô way, without which
I goe astray: ô saluation, without
which I perrish: ô light,
without which I walk in darknes.
Doe not ô Lord, doe not
suffer, that at any time I should
be plucked away from thee:

for in thee alone I liue, & without
thee I dye: in thee I am
safe, and without thee I perish:
in thee I am some body, but
without thee I am no body. As
I shall more manifestly declare
in the sequent considerations,
which shall be vnto mee as a
most cleare glasse, which I looking
into with open, stedfast,
and constant eies, shall see both
the magnitude and multitude
of my miseries.
               
               
                  
                  A SPIRITVA'L
and heauenly Exercise, deuided
into seauen pithy and briefe
Meditations, for euery day in
the weeke one.
                  The first Meditation, for Monday:
of the miserie in which man
is created.
                  THE Prophet Ieremy
deploring the misery of
his own condition, saith;
How is it,
                     Ierem. 20. 
                     that I cam forth
of the wombe, to see labour and
sorrow, that my dayes should be
consumed with shame? If the
Prophet sanctified in his mothers
vvombe so lamentablie
spake of himselfe, what shall I
miserable and vvretched man
say, conceaued and borne of
my Mother in sinne?Hugo lib. 3. de anima. 
                     Hugo de
S. Victore doth very well counsaile
vs; ô man, sayth he, learne
to know thy selfe: Thou art

better if thou knowest thy self,
then if neglecting thy self, thou
knevvest the motions of the
starres, the vertue of hearbs, the
complexions of men, and the
natures of al heauenly & earthly
creatures. For many men
know many things, and know
not themselues, vvhen as the
knowledge of our selues is the
chiefest Philosophy.
                  Consider therefore ô man,What man was before hee was borne.
vvhat thou wast before thou
wert born: what thou art now
thou art borne vntill thou returne
to dust: and what thou
shalt be after death. Before
thou wast borne, wast thou any
other thing, but an impure
and vncleane matter, conceaued
of the corruption of the
flesh, in the pollution of pleasure,
in the heat of lust, and that
vvhich is vvorst of all, in the
corruption of sinne? Ponder

also with thy selfe, with what
meat thou wast nourished being
conceaued in thy mothers
wombe; surely with none other,
then with impure, menstruous
and hurtfull blood,
which stayeth in women from
the time of theyr conceauing,
that by it theyr yong ones may
be nourished in their wombes.
Remember that GOD hath
created thee of the slime of the
earth, which is the basest element.
Hee created the starres
and planets of fire, birds of the
ayre, and fishes of water: but
men and other creatures of the
slime of the earth. Therfore
compare thy selfe with the fishes
and beasts bred of the water,
and thou shalt find thy self
of a more abiect nature, & vilder
condition, then they are. If
thou beholdest the fowles and
creatures that liue in the ayre,

neyther art thou to be compared
vnto them: if thou considerest
the nature of the Planets,
starres, and other things
made of fire, thou art much
more ignoble. Thou canst
neyther be compared to celestiall
things, nor be preferred
before terrestriall: but if thou
comparest thy selfe to brute
creatures, in these alone thou
shalt find some semblance and
likelihood with thy selfe, as the
Wiseman testifieth, who sayth,
That the condition of the children
of men,Eccles, 3. and the condition of beasts
are euen as one condition vnto
them. As the one dyeth, so dyeth
the other: for they haue all one
breath, and there is no excellency
of man aboue the beast. For man
hath not, as touching his body,
any more then a beast hath,
seeing both of them are framed
and created of earth, and

both of them in like maner are
resolued into earth. Remember
that whē thou wast borne, thou
wast brought foorth into thys
miserable world howling and
weeping, as it were foreseeing,
and therfore bewayling the labours,
dangers & dolors which
in this worlde are to be sustained:
and that which is vvorst
of all, deploring death it selfe.
Wherefore, if perhaps thou
beest borne in a noble and honorable
place, neither remembrest
how vile a beginning and
howe abiect an originall thou
haddest; if the beautie of thy
countenaunce, and comlinesse
of thy proportion, if the lineaments
of thy body, if the fauor
of the people, if the heate of
youth, & aboundance of riches
take away the knowledge of
thy selfe frō thee, yet neuerthelesse,
if thou desirest to knovve

what man is, heare vvhat that
most glorious Father S. Augustine
sayth,S. Augustine. the star and light of
the doctors of the church, hear
I say what he saith; Wretched
man, saith he, what am I, but a
vessell ful of dung and corruption?
a stinking and detestable
worm? poore, naked, subiect to
many necessities? who knowes
not whence I came, nor whether
I shall goe. Miserable and
mortall am I, whose dayes vanish
& fade as a shadow, whose
life increaseth and decreaseth as
the Moone, and as a leafe vpon
a tree, nowe florishing, and to
morrow withering. I am earth,
misery, the child of wrath, and
a vessell of indignation & reprobation.
I was borne in the
corruption of sinne, I lyue in
miserie and labour, and shall
ende my dayes in griefe and
anguish.
                  
                     And Saint Bernard sayth:
Flesh wyth which thou hast so
great societie,S. Bernard in his meditations. is none other
thing but froth & fome made
fleshe: inuested in a fraile ornament:
but the time shall
come, vvhen it shall bee a miserable
and putrified carkasse,
and the foode of vvormes. For
bee it neuer so gaily garnished
and tricked vp, it is alwayes
flesh. If thou diligently considerest,
vvhat goeth foorth by
thy mouth and nostrils, and
the other passages of thy bodie,
thou neuer beheldest so
vile a dunghill. Consider ô
man, (sayth hee) vvhat thou
wert before thy byrth; vvhat
thou art from thy byrth till
thy death; and what thou shalt
be after this lyfe of thine is ended.
Certainelie, thou vvast
that thou vvert not, after that
thou haddst thy beeing of vile

matter, thou wast inwrapped
in a most vile filme, and nourished
in thy mothers vvombe
with menstrous blood. Thy
coate was a skin, so attired and
adorned camst thou vnto vs.
                  
                     And hath beauty, fauour, riches, and youth,
                     So sotted thy sences deuoyd of truth,
                     That mindlesse thou art how base was thy birth?
                     And that all men are dust, ashes, and earth?
                  
                  Man is none other thing, but
an vncleane sperme, a sacke of
dunge, and foode for wormes:
                  
                     After a man a worme, after a worme, stinch & faetour,
                     So from a man to no man, is turned this creature.
                  
                  Hetherto S. Bernard, with
whom agreeth Innocentius.Innocentius of the miseries of mans life. O
indignity, saith he▪ & vildnes of
mans condition. Consider the

plants & trees, they bring forth
leaues, flowers, & fruites, pleasant
to the tast, & delightful for
smel: but wretched man bringeth
forth pestilent & noysom
sauours: & as the tree is, such
also is the fruite; for an euill
tree cannot bring foorth good
fruit. But wilt thou more manifestly
know, what man is, after
hee is borne? heare most patient
Iob,Iob, 14, 
                     Man saith he, that is
borne of a woman, is of short continuance
and full of trouble. Hee
shooteth foorth as a flower, and is
cut downe, hee vanisheth also as a
shadow, & continueth not. Why
do we seek for the testimonies
of men, let vs aske God himselfe,
Gene, 3, & he wil tel vs: Remēber
man that thou art dust▪ & to dust
shalt thou returne. This knowledge
had holy Iob,Iob, 10, whē he said
vnto God: Remember I pray
thee, ô that thou hast made

me as the clay, and wilt bring me
into dust againe.
                  
                  O man of clay, why art thou
proude? ô dust, why growest
thou insolent? ô ashes, for what
woldest thou be commended,
vvhose conception is sinfull,
vvhose natiuitie is painefull,
whose life is labour, and death
necessitie? Why dooest thou
nourish thy body so delicately?
Why dooest thou adorne that
vvith so precious garments,
which after a while shall in the
sepulchre be eaten of vvormes?
VVhy dooest thou not rather
beautifie thy soule vvith good
workes, which shal be carryed
into heauen by the handes of
good Angels? VVhy dooest
thou neglect thy soule, and so
extraordinarilye cocker thy
flesh? Behold confusion and
prepostrous order, the soule,
which ought to rule, serueth

the flesh; and the fleshe ruleth
which should obey. Why sufferest
thou the Ladie to bee
the handmaid, & the hādmaid
to vsurpe authoritie ouer the
Lady? Doost thou not know
that thy flesh is a domestical &
homebred enemie vnto thy
soule, which vnder colour of
friendship, is more cruell then
the most tirannous enemie?
When thou cherishest & delicately
nourishest it, thou breedest
and bringest vp thine own
enemie: when thou deckest &
beautifiest it, thou armest thine
enemy against thee: whē thou
arraiest it in precious garments
and outlandish skins of wilde
beastes, thou robbest thy soule
of all beautifull and heauenly
ornaments.
                  Thirdly, ô sinner cōsider what
thou shalt be, whē thou ceasest
to liue. Certainely thou shalt

be none other, but a miserable
and corrupted carkasse, an habitation
& foode for wormes.
If it please thee, viewe the bodies
of them, who are departed
out of this life, and thou shalt
finde nothing in them, besides
ashes, wormes, stinke, & lothsomnes.
What thou art novve,
they sometimes were, & what
they are nowe, thou shortly
must be: they were mē as thou
art now, they did eate & drink
as thou doost.Iob, 21, 
                     They spent theyr
dayes in wealth, & suddainly went
down to the graue. See how the
fleshe nourished in delights,
now beeing meate for wormes
lyeth in the graue: & how the
vnhappy soule descendeth, that
it may be fuell for the infernall
fire, without any hope that euer
the torments and punishments
shall haue end. VVhat
shall thē theyr vaine glory profit

them? in what steede shall
then the power of thys vvorlde
stand thē? what shal then their
carnall delights, & couetousnes
of riches help them? where
are then their merry disports?
where is then their boasting, &
presumptiō of false ioy? O into
hovve grieuous miseries are
they fallē after a short pleasure?
frō a counterfet mirth they are
fallen into assured misery, & eternall
torment. What hapned
vnto thē, may also happen vnto
thee, for thou art both a man, &
compounded of the same dust
& ashes, that they were framed
of; man of earth, slime of slime,
and after death thou shalt bee
turned into dust & ashes, neyther
knowest thou where, whē,
or how. Wherfore, seeing that
death waiteth for thee in euery
place, if thou beest wise, expect
him in like manner at all times,

and in euery place. Let the louers
of this worlde remember,
sayth Isidore,Isidore. how short the felicitie
of this world is, how barren
& slender the glory of it is,
and howe weake and fraile the
power is. Tell me if thou canst
where are the Kinges, Princes,
& Emperors of ancient times?
vvhere are the rich and mighty
men of this vvorld? They are
all passed away as a shadow, &
vanished as smoake: and if a
man seeke for them, hee shall
not finde them.
                  VVhat if wee say, that manie
of those Kings, Princes, &
Emperours, thought that they
shoulde alwayes conquer, and
neuer die. O blinde and ignorant,
beholde, it is not so, beholde
the matter is fallen out
quite otherwise, they are dead,
as other men are, theyr lyfes
haue fayled them, as the lyfes

of other Princes, that liued and
ruled before them.
                  What the estate of man is after
death, Saint Bernard dooth
very well teach: VVhat, saith
hee, is more stinking then a
carkasse? what is more horrible
then a dead man? He that
was of a beautifull coūtenance,
and comely stature, whilst hee
liued, after death lyeth with a
gastly and fearefull face: for
vvormes, putrefaction & horror,
follow a dead man. Which
thing, seeing it is so, vvhat doe
riches, delicacies, and honours
profit? Riches doe not deliuer
from death, nor delicacies frō
wormes, nor honours from
corruption.Chrysost. Epist. ad The odor. Laps. And Saint Chrysostome
sayth: Hast thou not
seene manie, that haue dyed amidst
theyr delights, euen in
their drunkennesse, & in other
fonde pleasures of thys lyfe?
                  
                     Where are they now, that not
long since ridd through the
streets brauely mounted, swelled
with pride, richly attired in
silkes, garded with attendants
and seruitours, smelling of perfumes,
oyntments, and spices,
fawned vppon with flatterers
and parasites, where is now all
their pompe and vaine toyes?
gone. Where are nowe theyr
large & costly banquets, theyr
immoderate laughters, theyr
ease and idlenes, theyr effeminate,
luxurious, and riotous
lifes? All is gone. What is become
of their bodies, that ere
vvhile vvere vvayted vppon
vvith so great troupes, and
were kept so neate and finicall?
Behold, they are gone
downe into the graue. Contemplat
the dust, ashes, worms,
the beauty of that pulchritude,
aud thou wilt sigh bitterly.
                  
                     Behold with diligence, and
pry narrowly into each of their
monuments, serch their graues
and Sepulchers, tosse & turne
ouer theyr bones and ashes,
thou shalt finde nothing heere
but ashes: nothing besides the
reliques of worms, which haue
eaten their bodies, and see what
is the end of them, albeit they
liued in this world in delights
and glory. I pray God, that
thou mayst diligently consider
of these things, and that they
may neuer slip out of thy memory.
But (ô greefe) the vnhappy
sonnes of Adam, neglecting
true and wholsom studies
and endeuours, doe seeke
for and hunt after vaine and
transitory pleasures. If therefore,
ô my brother, thou wilt
alwayes in thine hart meditate
of these things, and consider
the misery, and vildnes of this

life, thou wilt be humbled, and
wilt detest pride, seeing that
thou art not ignorant that
pride is the badge and cognisance,The deuil is the King of pride.
by which the children of
the deuill are knowne: For he
is,
                     Iob. 41. as holy Iob saith, the King ouer
all the children of pride. Gregory
confirmeth this;Greg. lib. 34. Moral, cap. 25. Pride,
saith he, is a most euident token
of reprobates: but contrarily
humility is a badge of the elect.
Seeing therfore that euery one
is knowne by that he hath, hee
is easily found vnder vvhat
King he warreth. For euerie
one carrieth as it were a certain
title of his labour, whereby hee
euidently sheweth, vnder whō
he serueth, that is, whether vnder
Christ, or the deuill. O
cursed pride, hated of GOD
and men. This tumbled Lucifer
headlong out of heauen:
banished Adam out of Paradice,

drowned Pharaoh with
his Army in the red Sea: depriued
Saul of his kingdome:
transformed Nabuchodonozer
into a beast, and destroyed
Antiochus with a most horrible
and hideous death.
               
               
                  The second Meditation for Tuesday:
of sin, and what discommodities
come by it.
                  
                     HE that committeth sinne,
saith the beloued Disciple
of Christ,1, Iohn, 3. 
                     is of the
deuill: for the deuill sinneth
from the beginning: for
this purpose appeared the Sonne
of God, that hee might loose the
works of the deuill. Sinne is so
heauy a burthen, that neyther
heauen, nor earth can beare it,
but with the Author and worker
of it, it descendeth into hell.
Euery word, deed, and thought
contrary to the lawe of God,

according to Saint Augustine,
is sinne: which ought, none otherwise
thē hell to be eschewed
of all them, who aspire to
the heauenly kingdome: and
that for three causes,Sinne is to be eschewed for three things. the first
of which is, because it displeaseth
God: the second, because
it pleaseth the deuill: the third,
because it is hurtfull, and bringeth
many discommodities to
man.
                  First, I say, thou oughtest to
eschew sinne, because it exceedingly
displeaseth thy Creatour,
in which place we are to
consider, what God hath done
by reason of sinne. No man is
ignorant that for sinne God
hath destroyed the workes of
his owne hands: that for sinne
he hath cast Angels out of heauen,
disparadiz'd men, and
drowned with flood of waters
all mankinde, as the booke of

Genesis vvitnesseth. Other
Kings and Emperours, that
they may reuenge the iniury
done vnto them of theyr enemies,
doe spoyle and wast their
Countries & Dominions: but
God subuerted and destroyed
his owne kingdome, because
sinne had entred into it. Neyther
doth God only hate sinne,
but all that, which by any manner
of way pertaineth vnto sin.
Men although the vvine hath
lost his vertue, doe not therfore
cast away the siluer bowles, in
which the wine is, but reseruing
them, they poure out the
wine: but God not onely casteth
out sinne, but also together
with sinne hurleth downe
headlong into the deepest Ocean
of hel the vessels, in which
it is, which are creatures & reasonable
soules, made according
to his owne image, and redeemed

with his precious blood.
Wherupon the wiseman saith:
Vngodlines, and an vngodly man
are alike hated of God. That
most patient man Iob sayth:
Thou doest visite me euery morning,
                     Iob. 7. 
                     and triest me euery moment.
Therefore in vvhat should I
hope, or wherin should I trust,
but in the mere mercy of God,
and in the affiance of celestiall
grace? For bee it that I dwell
amongst honest men, be it that
I conuerse and dyet with religious,
deuoute, and faythfull
friends, be it that I reade holy
Bookes, godly Treatises, and
sing heauenly Himnes, yet
they little, or rather nothing
at all profit mee, if the fauour
of GOD forsake mee, and
leaue me to my nakednes and
necessity. Therefore there is
none other remedy, but to embrace
patience, to deny my

selfe, and vvholy to yeelde vp
and offer my selfe vnto the deuine
will and pleasure. There
was neuer any man so religeous,
who did not sometimes
feele himselfe depriued of diuine
consolation, and that hee
wanted the zeale and feruour
of the spirit. There neyther
is, nor hath at any time been
any Saint, vvhom temptation
hath not sometimes taken
holde of. Certainely, hee is
not woorthy of that high and
sublime contemplation of
GOD, vvho before hath
not for the loue of GOD
been exercised in sundrie and
manifolde tribulations. Almost
alvvayes the praecedent
temptation is vvoont to bee
a token, that comforte is at
the doores. VVherefore
heauenlie consolation is promised
vnto them, that

are approoued and tried vvith
temptations, which the Scripture
affirmeth, when it is said:
To him that ouercommeth,
                     Apoc. 2. 
                     will I
giue to eat of the tree of life, which
is in the middes of the Paradice
of God. Wherefore God hath
not eyther in heauen, or vpon
the earth so deere and faithfull
a familier friend, whō he deadly
hateth not, if he finde deadly
sinne in him. Wherfore albeit
Christ loued Saint Peter entirely,
yet he had condemned
him, if he had died in that sin,
when thrice he denied his lord
and Maister.
                  Secondly, Gods hatred to sin
heereby also appeareth, that he
would haue his onely begotten
Sonne dye for the sinnes of
men, as Esay testifieth, saying:
For the transgression of my people
haue I strucken and plagued
him.
                     Esay, 53. And certainly the Sonne

of God himselfe, that he might
destroy sinne,Ibidem. deliuered his
owne soule into the hands of
death, as the same Prophet
sayth. Who was euer found
boyling with so great wrath against
his enemies, who that he
might destroy them, slewe his
onely Sonne?
                  Thirdly,God plagueth and punisheth sinne euery where. Gods detestation
to sinne is heereby also gathered,
that he hath persecuted it
euen from the beginning of
the world, to the end, not in
one place, but wheresoeuer he
found it. He found it in heauen,
and thence he banished it;
when he saw it remaining vppon
the earth, he came in his
owne person, that hee might
expell it thence, and at the last
in the finall iudgement he vvill
confine & include sinne within
the limits and bonds of hell,
as in his naturall place, as the

Prophet testifieth, saying; And
he will cast all our sinnes into the
bottome of the Sea.
                     Micah. 7.
                  
                  Fourthly, how greatly sinne
displeaseth God, this similitude
argueth:A Simily. vvithout all doubt
that fault is very odious and
abhominable, that causeth a
Mother to cast her beloued
Sonne into a burning furnace,
and not once to assay to take
him thence againe: so certainly
there must needes be some
great matter in it, and exceedingly
odious vnto God, for
which hee should cast his children
into eternall flames, if hee
finde sinne in them; vvhom
notwithstanding hee so loued,
that hee refused not to dye for
them. Thou seest heere ô sinfull
soule, how odious and abhominable
all sin is vnto God.
Wherefore if thou desirest to
please God, it is necessary, that

thou keepe thy selfe free and
clean from sinne, so that it possesse
not the least place in thee.
For shee shall be accounted a
very vnfaythfull woman,A Simily. who
admitteth into her bed an other
man besides her husband,
but especially, if shee admitte
one, that is his enemy, and of
whom hee is to expect many
discommodities and iniuries:
so also vnfaithfull is that soule,
vvhich of purpose and vvillingly
giueth place vnto sinne,
vvhich Christ our Redeemer
the true spouse of our souls hateth
so deadly; which wrought
him so many discōmodities, so
many losses, so many torments,
and for vvhich, he vvas hanged
naked vpon the Crosse. Wherfore
heere it pleaseth and liketh
mee vvell to imitate that regall
Prophet and svveete singer
of Israell, and saye:

                     Create in me a cleane hart,
                     Psal. 51. 
                     ô God,
and renue a right spirit within
mee.
                  
                  VVee sayd that the second
reason why sinne was to be eschewed,Sinne maketh the deuil merry.
is, because it maketh
merry our auntient enemy the
deuill: vvhich is gathered by
three signes and tokens. The
first is, because hee seeketh for
nothing in the whole world so
industriously: he hunteth not
after gold, nor siluer, nor precious
stones, but after soules, as it
is figured in Genesis, where the
King of Sodome sayth in the
person of the deuill; Giue mee
the soules,
                     Gen. 14. 
                     and take the goods to
thy selfe. Saint Gregory affirmeth
the same thing:Gregory. Perswade
thy selfe, that the deuill
seeketh for none other thing,
then to deceaue and destroy
soules:A Simily. for as an Hawke desireth
nothing so much, as the

hart of that bird, which he pursueth:
so the deuill desireth
nothing so much as the soule
of a sinner.
                  The second signe, whereby
we know that the deuill doth
loue sin is the continuall temptation,
by which he impugneth
and molesteth men, neyther is
euer wearied in solliciting man
vnto sinne. For there are almost
nowe past sixe thousand
yeares, in all which time hee
hath onely applied himselfe to
this study, that he might sinne,
and make man to sinne: neyther
is he tyred, yea hee daily
findeth and inuenteth nevve
kinds of sinne, hee is still nimbler
and busier in his endeuors
and temptations, & daily bringeth
men into new errours, as
wee see in the booke of Iob.
For when as God asked him,
whence he came? he aunswered:

                     From compassing the earth
to and fro,
                     Iob, 1. 
                     and from walking in it.
Hee is so busied in preferring
sinne, that he hath not time to
take any rest, as Iob testifieth:
They that pierce me through,
                     Iob, 30. saith
he, doe not sleepe.
                  
                  The third signe, that sinne
pleaseth the deuill, is, that hee
can neuer be satisfied with sin.
For although infinit thousands
of men haue descended to hell
for their impiety and pollution
of sinne, of whom the deuill is
the ringleader, yet he is not satisfied,
but alwayes hungerly,
Like a roaring Lyon walketh about,
                     1, Pet. 5. 
                     seeking whom hee may deuoure,
as Saint Peter testifieth
in his first Epistle generall. He
so hungreth and thirsteth, as it
is sayd in the booke of Iob, that
he drinketh vp the riuer,
                     Iob, 40. 
                     and hasteth
not: and hee trusteth that
hee can draw vp Iorden into his

mouth. His mouth is hell, and
the riuer that runneth into his
hellish mouth are sinners, vvho
with great celerity, as swift riuers,
hast into his iawes, whom
hee swalloweth vp with great
thirst and desire. It is reported
in the lifes of the Fathers, that
the Prince of deuils did commend
and honour one of his
traine; yea, commaunded him
to sitte in his chayre of estate
crovvned, because hee had
brought a certayne religious
man to the sinne of luxurie,
vvhom hee had beene enticing
fourty yeeres, and could not
bring him to nibble or byte at
his bayte.
                  Therefore mourne and lament
ô sinfull soule, verie bitterlie,
seeing thou hast so often
reioyced thy mortall enemies,
by sinning so mortallie to thy
greate losse and daunger,

and in steede thereof yeeld repentance,
and a pure conuersion
of heart vnto God, that
God and his Angells may in
like manner reioyce. For there
is ioy in the presence of the Angels
of God,
                     Luke, 15. 
                     for one sinner that
conuerteth.
                  
                  The third principall reason,The dammage and hurt that comes to the soule by sinne.
for which sinne is to be eschewed,
is the great dammage we
reape by it. For first by sinne
wee are estranged from God,
 and made his enemies. This is
that, which Esay saith: Your iniquities
haue seperated betweene
you and your God,
                     Esay. 59. 
                     and your sinnes
haue hid his face from you, that
he will not heare. If all the blessed
Cittizens of that heauenly
Country could either sinne, or
would sinne, they should fall
from heauen into the bottomles
depth of hell, and should
vtterly loose the amity and

friendship, which they haue
with God. Heere-vpon Augustine
saith:Augustine. If thy faythfull
friend offend thee, thou thinkest
him woorthy to be reprehended:
howe much more
worthy art thou to be blamed,
if thou sinnest against almighty
God, thy most gracious and
mercifull Father?
                  Secondly, sinne maketh his 
Author guilty of infernall torments.
And because the diuine
law doth not much differ from
humaine constitutions, that
which mans lawe doth to the
body, the same Gods lawe inflicteth
vpon the soule. Therfore
mark how the law of man
maketh the transgressor of the
Kings commaundement, and
the contemner of his royall
Maiesty guilty of death; as it
is written in Ezra, where it is
remembred that King Darius,

when he had promulgated his
decree as concerning the reedifying
of the temple at Ierusalem,
added at the end of his
letter Pattens: I haue made a
decree:
                     Ezra. 6. 
                     That who soeuer shall alter
this sentence, the wood shall be
pulled downe from his house, and
shall be set vp, and he shall be hanged
thereon, and his house shall be
made a dunghill for this. This
vvood is our owne consciences.
VVee haue the lyke example
in Ester,Ester, 7. where Assuerus
commaunded Haman to
be hanged. This is the sentence
of GOD, which he will pronounce
at the last day agaynst
them, who shall bee found to
haue liued in theyr sinnes; let
them be hanged vp in hell.
                  
                      The third losse is, sinne spoileth
man in this lyfe of all spirituall
graces, and in the world
to come of euerlasting glory:

wherefore Salomon saith: Sin
maketh men miserable.
                     Prou. 19. Neither
is a sinner onely miserable, because
hee hath not; but also
because hee hath lost himselfe,
and his liberty: he maketh
himselfe the deuills slaue and
captiue, neyther can he make
any spyrituall gayne, nor doe
any thing in this state acceptable
vnto God. Neither doth
hee liue, albeit his body breath
a little.Lib. 3. de consol. Philoso. cap. 1. For a wicked man, as
sayth Boethius, is not aliue, but
dead: for by sinne hee hath
seperated him-selfe from the
light; and is blind. The same
testifieth Sophonias:Soph. 2. 
                     They shal
walke, sayth hee, as blinde men,
because they haue sinned agaynst
the Lorde. And Dauid sayth:
They haue not knowne nor vnderstoode:
                     Psal. 21. 
                     they walke in darknesse,
all the foundations of the
earth are out of square.
                  
                  
                     Esay in the person of sinners
dooth more elegantly set them
out in their colours:Esay, 59. 
                     We grope
for the wall like the blind, and we
grope as one without eyes: wee
stumble at the noone day as in the
twilight: we are in solitary places,
as dead men. Sinne is the same
in the soule,A simily. that rottennes is in
an apple: for as that doth corrupt
the tast, smell, colour, and
the whole beauty of the apple:
so sinne doth rob the soule of
the dignity of grace, of the report
of a good name, and of
the comlines of all her beauty.
For this cause Esay doth compare
sinners to the mire of the
streetes.Esay, 10. Augustine also affirmeth,
that a dead dogg doth
not stink so filthily in the nosethrils
of men, as a sinfull soule
doth before God and his Angels.
August. Ser. 144. de tempt. And the same Father in
a certaine Sermon desirous to

call a man from the way of sinners,
saith: What doth it profit
thee, if all thinges be good in
thine house, and thou thy selfe
be not good? Tell mee, I pray
thee, why wouldest thou haue
any euil or naughtines in thine
actions, thoughts, or desires?
& wouldest not haue naughty
graine; nor an euill tree, but a
good one, a good horse, a good
seruant, a good friend, a good
child, & a good wife? But why
doe I remēber these great matters,
when thou wilt not haue a
ragged, but a whole garmēt, &
to be briefe a good shooe, and
not one that is torn? Or tel me
of any thing, that thou wishest
for, which is naught, or that
thou desirest any thing, which
is not good? I thinke that
thou vvouldest not haue a ruinous
house, but a good house:
and wilt thou onely haue an

euill soule? VVherein hast
thou offended thy selfe? In
what hast thou deserued ill of
thy selfe? Wilt thou not haue
anie thing euill among thy
good things, but only thy selfe?
Prefer I pray thee thy life before
thy shooes.
                  All thinges that are obuious
vnto thine eies are good,
beautifull, and elegant, and
thou louest them, and art delighted
in them, and hovve can
it be, that thou thy selfe wilt be
euill, vile, impure, and abiect?
If all thinges, that are in thine
house could speak, they would
crie aloude, and say: If thou
desirest that vvee should bee
good, vvee also desire a good
Maister: and they would exclayme
against thee vnto God,
and say; O good God, thou
hast giuen vnto this man so
manie good thinges, and so

much vvealth, vvhen as hee
himselfe is vvicked and euill,
vvhat doe those thinges profitte
hym, vvhich hee hath,
vvhen as his vnderstanding is
blinded, and he possesseth not
the Lord, that bestovved these
things vpon him?
                  The fourth dammage is,
that sinne maketh a man a
brute beast.Lib. 4. de consola. Philos. Therefore Boethius
sayth: If thou takest
goodnesse from a good man
hee shall bee a beast. And
Aristotle sayth in his Ethicks,
that such a man is vvorse then
a beast. Neyther dooth the
holie Scripture dissent from
them,Psal. 49. vvhen it sayth: Man
beeing in honour, hath no vnderstanding:
but is compared vnthe
beasts that perrish.
                  
                  The fift dammage is, that sin 
maketh a man the child & seruant

of the deuil: hence is that
of Iohn:1, Iohn, 3. 
                     He that committeth sin,
is of the deuill. And our Lord
saith in the Gospell: Yee are of
your father the deuill.
                     Iohn, 8. Therfore
ô thou sinner howe vnhappy
art thou, that feelest so great
losses and dammages? take
pitty therefore on thine owne
soule, and doe not burden and
loade it with sinnes.
                  These things being thus, remember
ô man, and acknovvledge
these three mayne and
huge mischiefes, which sinne
bringeth vnto thee, that is, the
offending of God, the reioycing
of the deuill, and infernall
torments. Consider furthermore
the noblenes of thy soul,
and hovve daungerous thy
wounds be, which could not be
healed but onely by the blood,
and woundes of the Sonne of
God. Vnlesse the wounds of

thy soule had been euerlastingly
mortall and deadly, the Son
of God, had not died for them.
Therefore doe not sleightly
prize or lightly weigh the concupiscences
of thy soule, which
that same supreame Maiesty of
God did so greatly and highly
account of. Hee aboundantly
poured out teares for thee, euery
night wash thou thy bed
with teares, & water thy couch
with continuall contrition. He
shed his blood for thee: shed
also thine by the daily affliction
of thine hart, and continuall
tribulation of thy spirit. Doe
not regard what thy body desireth,
but respect vvhat thy
soule willeth: for Saint Gregory
sayth: where the body
liueth a while in delights, there
the soule is tortured with perpetuall
torments. And by how
much the body is afflicted in

this life, by so much the spirit
reioyceth in the other. Therefore
Saint Augustine admonisheth
vs very well: Let vs denie
our owne vvills for Iesus
Christ: for they must once be
forsaken: neither doth it please
God that for temporall things
we should loose eternall blessings.
If thou wast permitted
certayne yeares to liue in the
delights of this flesh, with this
cōdition, that afterwards thine
eyes should be plucked out, or
that thou being depriued of all
delicates, shouldest most miserably
perrish through hunger
and thirst, and wretchedly contend
with famine, affliction, &
misery, I perswade my self, that
thou wouldest neuer wish for
such manner of delicats. What
I pray thee is this life? In truth
it is not the space of one moneth;
vvhat doe I say of a moneth?

Nay, it is not the space
of one houre, not of a minute,
no not of a moment, if it bee
compared to that eternall beatitude,
or to those torments of
hell, vvhich haue none ende,
and lyke which none can bee
thought of.
               
               
                  The third Meditation for Wednesday:
howe dangerous it
is to deferre repentance.
                  OVR Redeemer inuiting
vs all vnto repentance,
sayth: If any man
will follow mee,
                     Math. 16. 
                     let him
forsake himselfe,Luke. 9. and take vp his
Crosse, and follow mee: for whosoeuer
vvill saue his lyfe, shall
loose it. It is necessary, that
all sinners doe take vp thys
Crosse, and carry it with perseuerance,
if they desire to raigne

with Christ Iesus. Wherefore
Saint Hierome writing to Susanna,
saith: that repentance
ought to be equall, or greater
then the sinnes.Hier. in an Epistle to Susanna. That repentance
is necessary, sayth hee,
which may either equalize the
faults, or exceede them. And
Saint Augustine saith: Whosoeuer
will be saued, it is necesary
that hee be washed at the
least with the teares of the contrition
of his hart, being cleansed
before by baptisme from
all those blemishes and pollutions,
which sinne had spotted
and soyled him withall. But if
thou shalt say, that this is a hard
saying, and that thou canst not
forsake the world, nor hate thy
flesh, nor chastice thy body:
heare what is sayd, not of mee,
but of Saint Hierome:Hier in an Epistle to Iuliana. cap. It is a
difficult thing, nay it is impossible,
that any one should enioy

both present and future blessings:
that hee should fill his
belly heere, and his soule there:
that from delicacies he should
passe vnto delightes: that in
both worlds he should be graced
& carry his head aloft, and
that hee should appeare glorious
both in heauen, & in earth.
Which sentence Saint Gregory
confirmeth: Many, saith he
doe desire to flye out of the exile
of this present life, vnto celestiall
ioy, who in the meane
time will not forsake the pleasures
of this world. The grace
of Christ Iesus doth call them,
but the concupiscence of the
world doth detaine thē. They
desire to dye the death of the
righteous, but they wil not liue
as they doe: such shall euerlastingly
perrish, because theyr
works shal follow them. The
austerity of holy Iohn Baptists

life, sayth Saint Bernard, is a
hard sentence of death vnto
sinners: who when there arose
not a greater then hee among
those that are born of women,
did so chastice, correct, and afflict
his most innocent body:
and yee hast to be clothed with
silke, fine linnen, and purple,
and to fare deliciously. O wicked
man, this is not the Kings
high vvay vnto heauen. Remember
the rich glutton, who
vvas the Lorde of such great
wealth, who was cloathed in
purple and fine linnen, & fared
wel & delicatly euery day, who
afterwards could not haue one
smal drop of water to coole his
tong, beeing tormented in the
midst of the flames of hel. Cō
                     sider
this ô my frend, & repent,
whilst thou hast time. Heare
what Saint Gregory saith: Although
God promiseth pardō
                     
vnto the penitent, yet he hath
not promised to morrow vnto
a sinner.True repentance. It is repentance to deplore
sins past, & not to cōmit
any hereafter. Therfore it is very
well sayde of S. Augustine:
Vaine is that repētance,August. in his Soliloquies. which
the future fault doth pollute:
lamentations do nothing profit,
if sins be multiplied: it nothing
auaileth to craue pardon
for euils, if eftsoons thou renuest
& reiteratest thy follies.Three parts of repentance. We
must note for the further manifestation
of this matter, that
true repentance doth cōsist of
three parts, which are, contrition
of hart, cōfession of mouth,
& satisfaction of deed. For we
haue offended God three maner
of vvayes, by delight of
thought, by lapse of tong, and
by pride of works: and these
three are to be cured by three
contrarie remedies, delight

of thought by the sorrow and
contrition of hart: the lapse of
the tongue by the confession
of the mouth: and the pride
of workes by vpright and vncorupted
satisfaction. Of these
three parts therefore wee will
speake,Contrition what it is. and first of contrition,
which is a voluntary greefe taken
for sinne committed, with
a purpose of confession, satisfaction,
and heereafter not to
sinne any more. Contrition
must haue foure degrees according
to Bernard:In his 16. Sermon vppon the Cant. Furthermore
know, saith he, that thou
hast wholy recouered thy wits
and sences, if thou feelest thy
conscience to be bitten with a
fourefold compunction, with a
double shamfastnes, and with a
double feare. Therfore in thy
plangors and lamentations for
thy selfe, think of God thy maker,
think of thy father, think of

him, who is bountiful & gracious,
& think of thy Lord: and
knowe that thou art guilty in
each respect; deplore and lament
each offence; thy feare
doth make aunswer to the first
and last, & thy shamfastnes to
the two in the midst. Be it that
thy Father doth wink at thee,
that he that is bountiful & gracious
doth pardon thee: but
thy Lord & Creatour will not.
He that spared not his Son, wil
not spare the workmanship of
his hands, nor a wicked seruant
&c. We offend the Lord our
God the Creator of all things:
we more wickedly offend our
heauenly father, being so gracious
& bountifull; who doth
support, & nourish vs, in which
thing we are worse then dogs,
who do loue & folow them, of
whom they are nourished; but
most vilely we offend God, by

crucifying againe by sinne our
Redeemer, as much as lieth in
vs, who hath redeemed vs by
his most precious blood, and
hath deliuered vs from all the
snarés & entrappings of sinns,
from the cruelty of deuils, and
frō infernall punishments. We
must bee sorrowfull for three
things, for sin committed, for
good omitted, & for time lost.August.
Augustin speaketh of the dignity
of cōtrition. The cōtrition
of the hart auaileth more, then
to go on pilgrimage throughout
the world. And Cassianus
vpon the Psalme,Cassianus vpon the 120. Psalm. 
                     I called vnto
the Lord in my trouble, sayth, the
Lord doth not knowe how to
put of him, whō he knoweth to
entreat him with a broken and
pierced hart. And Chrisostom
sayth:Chrysost. of the compunction of the hart. It is only compunction,
which maketh a man to abhor
purple, to desire sackcloath, to

worke righteousnes, to loue
teares, and to auoid laughter.
                  Of Cōfession,Confession In his 30. Sermon to the brethren in the wildernes. which is an other
part of repentance, S. Augustin
saith, that it is the health
of soules, an expeller of vices, a
restorer of vertue, an impugner
of wicked spirits, a feare of hel,
an impedimēt of the deuill. O
holy & admirable confession,
thou shuttest the mouth of hel,
and openest the gate of Paradice.
And in another place: He
that accuseth himself of his sins
the deuil cannot accuse him at
the day of iudgmēt,In his 5
                           •
                        , Sermon de tempore. if in cōfessing
them he blot those things
out by repentance, which hee
hath done: neither doth renue
that againe, which he hath cō
                     mitted.
But woe be vnto vs, that
whē so many & so great blessings
& benefits are foūd in repētance,
& yet there are so few
found, that do take it vpon thē.
                  
                     Heereupon God complaineth
in Ieremy,Ierem. 8. saying: I harkned &
heard, but none spake right: no
man repented him of his wickednes,
saying; What haue I done.
Heare what S. Isidore saith:Isidor. lib. de Etym. It
is confession by which the lurking
disease of the soule is opened
to the prayse of God, in
hope to obtaine pardon. Of
which vertue Ambrose sayth;
When confession proceedeth
frō a man, then the vengeance
of God ceaseth. And Cassiodorus
saith; Iesus Christ is not
their Iudge, but their Aduocat,
who accuse thēselues by theyr
own cōfession. Leo also agreeth
with these:Leo in a Sermon. that is not to be cō
                     demned,
saith he, in iudgment,
which was purged by confession.
Goe too therfore, my brother,
& follow the councell of
Esay, & first recount thine iniquities,
that thou maist be iustified.
                     
For the confession of sins is the
beginning of righteousnes.
                  Of satis-faction,Satisfactiō. which is a
third part of repentance, thus
speaketh S. Augustine:Augustine in his Soliloquities. Satisfaction
is to cut of the causes of
sin, and not to cherrish by suggestions
any entrance into thē.
Gregory sayth thus:Gregory. vvee do
not satis-fie, although we cease
from iniquitie, vnlesse, on the
contrary side we persecute by
opposite bewaylings, the pleasures,
which wee loued. Chrysostome
consenteth vnto thys.
The reconciliation, sayth hee,
ought to be equal to the precedent
offence: thou oughtest to
be as readie to lament, as to offend,
and as thine intent vvas
to offend, such also ought thy
deuotion to bee in repenting;
for great sinnes doe require also
great greefe and sorrow.
                  Wherefore, Eusebius sayth:

A light and slight contrition,
dooth not effect,Hom 5, ad Monachos. that those
debts may be forgiuē, to which
euerlasting death is due: neyther
is a transitory satisfaction,
sufficient for those euils, for
which eternall fire is prepared.
There is neede of much vveeping,
of much mourning, of
great griefe of heart, to heale
the griefes and sorrowes of the
hart. We must endeuour with
the vvhole contrition of the
spyrite, that those olde euills,
vvhich as arrowes stick in our
consciences, may be pulled out.
It is not sufficient, vvith the
lips onely to say; I haue offended,
spare me, & remit my sins.
But we are presently weary, &
looke behind vs, as Lots vvife
did; wherfore we are diligently
to cōsider the words of Bernard;
He that perfectly knoweth,
sayth he, the burden of sin,

& the plagues & greeuāces of
his soul, he shal litle or nothing
at all feele the punishments &
castigations of his body, neyther
shall they be troublesome
vnto him, certainly perswading
himselfe that God wil haue respect
vnto him, & that he shall
auoyd those things, which hee
was desposed and prepared to
commit. Hereupon S. Augustine
saith,Augustine in Psal, 50, writing vpon the
Psalme; Haue mercy vpon me, ô
God: Many there be, sayth he,
that are not ashamed to sinne,
but they are ashamed to repent.
O incredible madnes, art
thou not ashamed of thy
wound, & art thou ashamed of
the binding vp of thy wound?
Is it not being naked more vgly?
Run therfore to the Phision,
repent, & say; I doe confesse
mine iniquity, and my sinne is alwayes
before mee: against thee

onely haue I sinned, and done this
euill before thee.
                  
                  Satisfaction consisteth in
three things;In what things satisfaction cō
                        sisteth. In prayer, Almesdeedes,
& Fasting: which are
as it were certaine antidotes against
so many capitall vices,
by which we offend GOD:
and these three vices doe arise
from three principall enemies
of our soules. Pride is ingendered
of the deuill, couetousnes
of the world, & luxury of our
own flesh: of which thus speaketh
Saint Iohn: All that is in
the world,
                     1, Iohn, 2, 
                     is the lust of the flesh,
the lust of the eyes, and the pride
of life. Prayer restraineth pride,
Almes-deedes banisheth couetousnesse,
and fasting brideleth
lust. Furthermore, wee alwayes
sinne eyther against God, and
so in like manner prayer is opposed
against all that sin, & by
it we are accepted of God, as

as the Wise-man saith: The
prayer of him that humbleth him
selfe,
                     Ecclus, 35, 
                     goeth thorowe the clowdes,
and coaseth not till it come neere,
and will not depart till the most
High haue respect therevnto: or
we sinne against our selues, &
against such a sinne, fasting is
effectuall, according to that of
Augustine: Restraine & bridle
your flesh by fasting & abstinence:
Or we sinne against
our neighbour, & here almes-deedes
are of force; of which
our Sauiour speaketh in Luke,
Giue almes,
                     Luke, 11, 
                     and all things shall be
cleane to you. For as water extinguisheth
fire, so almes-deeds
quench sinne. Almes-deedes
are called the water of GOD,
and a precept of mercy commaunded
vnto vs of the sonne
of God.
                  Wherefore for three causes
we are bound to giue almes, &

to exercise the works of charitie:
The fruites of almes-deedes.
First, because by mercy sin
is wiped away: VVhereupon
Salomon sayth: By mercie and
truth,
                     Prou, 16, 
                     iniquitie shall bee forgiuen.
The Scripture maketh mention
of that poore widdow, who
hauing but a little oyle,2, King. 4. and exercising
mercy, filled all her
empty vessels, & the oyle was
so multiplied, that shee had enough
to pay her debts, and to
satisfie all her creditors. These
empty vessels are the poore,
whom we must bring into our
houses,Esay, 58. according to that saying
of Esay; Deale thy bread to
the hungry, bring the poore that
wander, home to thyne house,
when thou seest the naked, couer
him, and hide not thy selfe from
thine owne flesh. Like vnto thys
is the counsell of Tobias, saying
vnto his sonne; Giue almes
of thy substance;
                     Tob, 4, 
                     and when thou

giuest almes, let not thine eye bee
enuious, neyther turne thy face
from any poore, least God turne
his face from thee. Giue almes
according to thy substance: if
thou haue but a little, bee not afraid
to giue a little almes. And
so a little of thys oyle of mercie,
shall more and more abound,
beeing increased with
the augmentation of grace.
                  Furthermore, almes multiplyeth
our temporall goods,Lib. 18. Moral. c. 10 as
Gregory testifieth, saying: vve
loose earthly thinges by keeping
them and preserue them
by giuing them away; And in
another place: vvhatsoeuer is
giuen to the poore, if it be well
considered, is not a gift, but a
lone, because that which is gyuē,
is receiued again without all
hazard, or aduenture with aduantage:
as for example,1, Kings, 1
                           •
                        
                      where
the widdowes oyle and meale

is increased, who nourished Elias:
wherby it is manifest, that
the poore doe rather feede thē
that giue almes, then are fedde
of them.
                  Thyrdly, because almes is a
worke of mercie, which vvayteth
vpon the soule to heauen,
as S. Ambrose testifieth, who
sayth: They are not the goods
of man, which he cannot carry
with him. Onely mercy is a
cōpanion of the dead. O how
good and necessary a companion
is almes for the deade?
Therefore do not despise such
a cōpanion, which like an Aduocate
goeth before thee, and
not followeth after; as those
wretches do contemne it, who
will not extend their almes in
theyr life time, beeing not vnlike
to them that cause light to
be carrryed behind them, whō
the Wise-man reprehendeth,

saying: Say not vnto thy neighbour,
                     Prou, 3, 
                     Goe and come againe, and
to morrow will I giue thee, if thou
now haue it.
                  
                  Hee that is rich ought to cō
                     sider
three things in giuing his
almes,Three thinges to be considered in almes. the first of the which is:
that it is God that requireth the
almes, & that he will haue that
mercy in the same account, as
if it were done to himselfe, according
to that, vvhich Christ
sayth in the Gospell:Math, 25, 
                     That
which yee haue doone vnto one of
the least of these my bretheren,
yee haue doone it vnto mee.
                  
                  GOD dooth begge of the
rich money for the poore, of
whom the rich daily desire the
kingdom of heauen. He therfore
that denyeth almes to the
poore, God requiring it, it is
greatly to be feared, least God
in lyke manner denie vnto him
the kingdome of heauen, and

that he will not heare him, whē
he cryeth, according to that of
Salomon in his Prouerbs:Prouerb, 21 
                     Hee
that stoppeth his eare at the crying
of the poore, he shall also cry,
and not bee heard.
                  
                  The second thing that a rich
man ought to thinke of, beeing
about to giue almes, is, that
almightie GOD dooth require
that for the poore, which
is his owne, seeing that hee is
the Lorde of all those thinges,
which wee possesse; therefore
hee is without doubt most ingratefull,
that denyeth necessarie
almes vnto the poore.
                  
                     Dauid was farre of from
thys ingratitude, when he said:
Might, and power, and glorie,
and victorie, and prayse (ô Lord)
are thine. For all things that are
in heauen, and in earth are thine:
Thine is thy kingdome O Lorde,
and thou art aboue all Princes,

Riches and honour are thine. All
thinges are thine, and wee giue
vnto thee, that which wee haue
receiued at thine hands.
                  And thys cogitation ought
the more to mooue vs vnto
almes, because GOD receyueth
what we giue, and dooth
repay vs not onely our principall,
but an hundred fold. This
is that, which Saint Augustine
saith:Augustine in his Epistles. If thou wilt bee a good
Merchant, and a gainefull Vsurer;
gyue that vvhich thou
canst not keepe, that thou
mayst receiue what thou canst
not loose. Gyue a little, that
thou mayst receiue an hundred
folde, giue a temporall
& fading possession, that thou
maist receiue an euerlasting inhearitance.
                  Therfore he is not onely ingratefull,
but also madde, who
dooth not giue vnto God his

reuenues, that he may receiue
them againe with so great interest:
when as both the Iewes,
the Ethnicks, and the Moores,
willingly doe it. Wherfore my
deere Brother repent, and gather
and lay vp the treasuries of
mercy in a safe place, in celestiall
securitie, and not among
earthly dangers. Consider that
the hart of a couetous man, is a
pytte vvithout a bottome; the
more it receiueth, the more it
desireth, neyther is at any time
satisfied as the Wiseman sayth:
A couetous man is not satisfied
with money.
                     Eccles. 11. Woe be vnto them
that lay vp their treasures in the
earth: for theyr hearts are afflicted,
because they cannot
enioy theyr riches, and they
keepe them with danger, and
will they, nill they, they must
at the last part from them, and
suffer punishment in hell.
                  
                     Lay vp thy treasure my deer
and good brother, in thine own
Countrey, which is Heauen,
where thou shalt liue alwayes,
and neuer haue hope to enioy
these, which are to bee left in
the earth: perswade thy selfe
that those are thy goods, which
thou hast layde out & bestowed
on the poore; for those are
not properly thy goods which
thou canst not carry with thee.
Heare what S. Ambrose saith:Ambrose in his offices.
Nothing dooth so much commend
a Christian, as commiseration,
and charity. And saint
Ierome sayth:Hiero. to Nepotianus. I doe not remē
                     ber
that I haue read, that any
one dyed an euill death, vvho
willingly exercised the workes
of charity. For they haue the
prayers of many, and it is impossible
but that theyr prayers
shoulde bee heard. And Leo
commending this vertue, saith;

Hee shall receiue many great
blessings at Gods hands,Leo of the apparition of our lord. who
letteth not the poore depart
from him without comfort.
                  Mercy is of so great vertue,
that without it, others doe not
any whitte profit. Bee it that
thou art faithful, sober, & chast,
& adorned with vvorthier titles,
yet if thou beest not mercifull,
thou shalt finde no mercy.
And this may bee enough to
moue the mindes of men, that
they may readily & cheerfully
take vpon thē this third part of
repentance, which is Satis-faction.
Of this repentance, that
we may return to our purpose,
our Sauiour sayth; He that taketh
not vp his crosse & followeth
me, is not worthy of me. Which
if it be true, we are to performe
our repentance as speedily as
may be, yea in our youth: for
then it is more profitable vnto

vs, & more acceptable to God,
as the wise man teacheth, saying;
Eccles, 12▪
                      
                     Remember thy creator in the
daies of thy youth, whiles the euill
daies come not, nor the yeeres approch,
wherein thou shalt say, I
haue no pleasure in thē. My son,
defer not from day to day thy
conuersion vnto the Lord, least
his anger come on a suddaine,
and condemne thee, & destroy
thee in the time of vengeance.
Be not deceiued with the suggestions
of that cursed serpent
sathan, which suggesteth vnto
thee hope of a lōger life, & that
thou shalt repent thee enough
a little before thou dyest, that
he vnwares may oppresse and
subuert thee, as the Wise man
sayth:Ecclus, 20, 
                     To promise vnto thy selfe
longer life, is great wickednesse, &
hath destroied many, and hath remooued
them as the waues of the
sea.
                  
                  
                     It is euill, because it is contrarie
to reason and iustice:It is wicked and naught, to promise vnto thy selfe a longer life.
worse, because it is against the
sinner himselfe: but it is most
vile, vngodly, and cursed, because
it warreth and fighteth against
the diuine will. That it
is euill, & contrary to reason &
iustice, is proued by three examples.
                  
                      First, it is against iustice, if any
one hauing many horses, among
which hee may deuide
the weightie and heauie burden,
will lay the whole vveight
vpon one, which is the weakest
and the oldest. Such an one is
he, that reserueth for feeble old
age the vvhole burthen of repentance,
& all the sins which
hee committed in his youth,
which is vnsufficient for the
burden, and can by no meanes
beare it. Of such Saint Isidore
sayth: They that mispend the

time of repentance vvithout
fruite, in vaine desire of the
Lord, that the gate may bee opened
vnto them. The Prophet
Malachie denounceth a
curse against such an one.Malach. 1, 
                     Cursed
be the deceiuer, saith he, that
hath in his flocke a male, & voweth
and sacrificeth vnto the Lord
a corrupt thing.
                  
                  Secondly hee seemeth vnto 
mee, more foolish and more
vniust, who when he is strong
and healthfull, will not carry a
small burden, but had rather
stay, till his burden bee greater,
and himselfe weaker. Such an
one is he, that doth not carrie
the burdē of repentance in his
youth, and so long as it is light
and little: but putteth it of to
olde age, when as hee himselfe
shall be weaker, & his burden
wayghtier. Wee haue an example
of this in the booke of

the Fathers: One cutting
downe wood, bound vp a burden
of it, and then made tryall
whether he could carry it, but
seeing himselfe not able to carry
the same, he cut down more
wood, and made him a greater
burden, and by how much hee
was lesse able to lift it vp, by so
much he augmented it. After
the same manner doe sinners,
who deferring the time of repentance,
do encrease the burden
of their sinners.
                  For as S. Gregory saith:Gregory. the
sinne that is not foorth-with
clensed and purged by repentance,
doth drawe on another
with his weight. Thirdly, is
 not hee exceeding vniust and
madde, that bestoweth & consumeth
all the time of hys lyfe,
all his cost, & all his diligence,
in building of houses, in which
notwithstanding hee is not

minded to dwell: but dooth
pull downe with all his might
and maine the house, which he
hath determined to inhabite?
Certainly, this man altogether
worketh against the iudgment
of reason, and is worthy to bee
counted both a foole & a mad
man. Thys doth a sinner, who
proroging his cōuersion to the
howre of death, buildeth for
himselfe a habitation in the
depth of hell, where notwithstanding,
hee desireth not to
dwell. Feare and dreade therefore
that auncient saying: Hee
that dooth any thing against
his own conscience, buildeth in
hell.
                  Secondly,Hope of a longer life, is worse thē the former circūstances in respect of the sinner himself. in hope of a longer
life, something worse seemeth
to be, then that hath been
spoken, when it is to the preiudice
of the sinner himself. And
this is proued by two exāples.
                  
                     The first is, because if any
man had rather bee sicke, then
sound: a seruaunt, then free:
poore, then endued with some
cōpetent wealth: such an one
should be opposite and contrary
to himselfe. A sinner is
like to this man, because he had
rather liue, nay lye dead in sin,
which is a spirituall sicknes &
infirmity, thē be whole, strong,
and sound. Wherefore a sinner
is more cruel against himselfe;
for he had rather be dead then
aliue; sick, then sound; a seruaunt,
then free: as it is in S.
Iohn:Iohn, 8, 
                     Who soeuer committeth
sinne, is the seruant of sinne. And
S. Augustine saith:August. in his 4. booke of the cittie of God. A good
man, albeit he serue, yet hee is
free; but an euil man, although
he raigne, yet is he a seruaunt:
neyther of one man alone, but
(that which is more grieuous)
of so many maisters as he hath

vices. The second example is,
he is a debter, who taketh any
summe of money vpon vsury;
for by so much more doth hys
debt & vsury increase, by how
much he is longer in discharging
it; and to bee so much the
more negligent in repaying it,
by how much hee is lesse sufficient
to repay, certainly it is
hurtfull & vnprofitable to him
selfe: Such an one is a sinner,
who perseuering in his sinnes,
the longer hee continueth in
them, the more hee increaseth
the vsury of hys faulte: and so
much the more punishment
shall he at the length suffer for
them. Herevpon S. Iohn saith
in his Reuelation;Apoc, 18, 
                     Inasmuch as
she glorified her selfe, and liued in
pleasure, so much giue yee to her
torment and sorrow.
                  
                  Thirdly, we sayd, that the
perswasion of a longer life was

most vile,The perswasion of a longer life, is most vile, and vngodly. vngodly, and cursed,
especially, because it directlie
fighteth against the goodnesse
of our Lord Iesus Christ: and
this is manifested by three examples,
 the first of which is: If
a seruant be disobedient to his
maister, throgh the whole race
and course of his life, whō notwithstanding
he is bounde to
serue faythfully, hauing receiued
many benefits of him: &
should serue the greatest enemie
that his maister hath, and
at the length at the end of hys
life, when his strength is decayed,
shoulde returne vnto his
maister, to waite vpon him, to
whom alwaies heeretofore he
hath been immorigerous, dost
thou thinke that this seruice
would be accepted of his maister?
Such an one is a sinner,
who after he hath offended his
Lord God all his life time, and

hath borne arms vnder the colours
of his aduersary, would at
the last return to the seruice of
God in his faint & feeble olde
age. Secōdly, if any one had receiued
mony, or other great riches 
of his Lord, on this cōdition,
that he should negociate &
traffick therwith, & by his diligence
should increase the sum:
and he in despight of his Lord
cōsumeth the mony vainely &
prodigally; without doubt he
offendeth both the goodnesse
of his Lord, and hindereth his
own profit, & should be counted
very vnthankful. A sinner
is not vnlike to such an one,
who hauing receiued of God a
soule & a body, with al the sences,
powers, externall goods,
length of dayes, & many other
benefites, dooth vnprofitably
consume them all, and squander
them abroade: and that to

the reproch and iniurie of his
Lord, Creator, and Redeemer:
by sinning sundry and diuers
wayes, by offending the goodnesse
of GOD; and by making
hauocke of all his goods,
but chiefely of his soule, which
is committed and commended
vnto him, as a most precious
treasure. Wherfore, S. Gregorie
sayd; Woe be vnto mee, if
I shall negligently keepe the
talent committed to me of the
Lorde, that is, my soule, redeemed
with the precious bloode
of that immaculate lambe, seeing
also, that there is not any
moment of time, which I am
not to giue an account of.
                  
                      The thyrd example. If any
one be a Steward, whose dutie
is, to dispose the goods of hys
Lord: if hee shoulde giue the
best bread, the best vvine, and
the best meates to strangers, &

to the enemies of his Lord; &
should sette before his Lorde
mustie bread, vnsauory meats,
putrified flesh, corrupted fishes,
and dead vvine: doe you
not thinke that this seruaunt
should badly fitte the humour
of his Lord? A wretched sinner
is like to such an one, vvho
offereth to the worlde, and to
the deuill, who are the enemies
of Christ Iesus his lord, the best
and fairest flower of his youth
and strength: and to his God
and lord, the worst part of his
lyfe, barren and vnprofitable
old age. Dauid did not so, who
saith of himselfe;Psalm, 38, 
                     I will keep my
strength for thee ô Lorde. And
the Wise man sayth, that from
his youth hee sought for wisedome,
Wised, 8. vvhich is true vertue.
But of all them that deferre repentance,
Gregory in his morals. Saint Gregory saith:
Hee is farre enough of from

fayth, vvho expecteth old age
to repent in. For it is to be feared,
least while hee hopeth for
mercy, he fall into iudgement.
For not any day is within hys
power, & therefore euery one
ought to follow the counsel of
Isidore, and conuert hymselfe
with all the diligence and hast
hee can, vnto the Lord; for if
hee lynger and loyter, he shall
at the length bee willing, but
not able to turne himselfe.
                  Which things beeing so, repent
my deere brother with all
speede and celeritie, and make
no longer tarrying, least thou
be reprobated and shutte out
with the foolish virgins.
               
               
                  
                  The fourth Meditation, for
Thursday: of the contempt of the
world, and with what hatred,
and diligence it is to
be eschewed.
                  THE glorious Apostle
S. Iohn saith;1, Iohn, 2, 
                     Brethren,
loue not the world, neither
the things that are in the
worlde. For if any man loue the
world, the loue of the Father is
not in him: and the world passeth
away, and the lust thereof. Saint
Augustine expounding thys
place,In his seconde tractate vpon the Epistle of S. Iohn. sayth: What wilt thou
doe? whether hadst thou rather
loue temporall things, and
so passe away with the tyme, or
Christ our Sauiour, and liue for
euer? If thou shalt loue thys
world, it will consume and destroy
thee; for it cannot defend
them that loue it.
                  
                     Thys VVorlde is as an excommunicated
man:The worlde is as a man excommunicated. for as the
Church doth not pray for him
that is excōmunicated: so Iesus
Christ dooth not pray for
the world, although he prayed
for them that crucified him. O
how great madnes is it to serue
such a lord, who at the end of
thy seruice, is wont to giue no
other wages, but nakednes and
desolation.A speech & fact of Saladine. So Saladine that
great Soldane of Babilon, the
conquerer of Asia, being at the
point of death, and seeing no
hope of life to remaine, cōmanded
his standard-bearer to bee
called vnto him, to whom hee
thus spake, saying; Thou hadst
wont to carry myne imperiall
ensigne before me, whē I went
to warre; nowe also carry the
ensigne of my death; which is
thys poore vvinding-sheete:
carry it thorow all the streetes

of Damascus, and cry: Behold
the king of all the East dieth,
& of all his spoyles & trophyes,
carryes none other with
him, but thys worne thredbare
winding-sheete. The lyke is
read of a certaine young king
of Lothoringia, vvho beeing
readie to giue vp the ghost, lying
in a most magnificent pallace,
and in a rich sumptuous
bedde, cryed out with a loude
voyce, that he might be heard
of all; O lorde Iesus Christ,
how woorthily is this world to
be condemned. See in vvhat
stately and royall buildings I
haue lyued, & now vvretched
creature that I am, knowe not
whither thys night following I
shall goe, what Inne I shall
haue, or what manner of entertainement
I shall find.
                  Therefore ô sinner flie from
the world, flye I say, from the

worlde, first, because it leaueth
thee in so great neede and misery.
For as the Apostle Saint
Iames saith; The amity of this
world,
                     Iames, 4, 
                     is the enmity of God. Whosoeuer
therefore will be a friende
of the world, maketh himselfe the
enemy of God. And Saint Gregory
sayth; A man is so much
the neerer vnto God, by howe
much he is further of from the
loue of the worlde.Gregory. For thys
cause the Lord would bee carryed
without the Citty, to signifie,
that hee had no parte in
the VVorlde: and whosoeuer
will bee pertaker of the fruites
of hys passion, hee must renounce
the vvorlde, and seperate
himselfe from all worldlie
conuersation, if not in act, yet
in desire: thys is that which almighty
GOD commaundeth
by his Prophet, saying; Get ye
out of Babylon, that euerie one

may saue his owne soule. Babylon,
Vpon the 7. chapter of Mich. according to the exposition
of Saint Hierome, is the
house of confusion, vvhich is
this world, in which confusion
raigneth euery where, as well in
the Clergy as in the Layitie, as
well in olde, as young, as well in
men, as women. Therefore it is
very well sayd of Saint Iohn in
his generall Epistle;1, Iohn, 5, 
                     The whole
worlde lyeth in wickednesse.
                  
                  Saint Bernard also counselleth
vs very well,Of conuersion vnto the Clergy. chap, 30, saying: Flye
out of Babylon, flye and saue
your soules. Fly to the Citties
of refuge, where ye may both
repent for sins past, and for the
present finde grace, and safely
looke for future glorie. Let not
the anguish and remorse of
your sins hinder you, nor the
austeritie of repentance deter
and afright you. For neither
the passions of this time, nor

the trybulation of thys world
are woorthy, for the fault past,
which is remitted; for the present
grace of cōsolation which
is bestowed; nor for the future
glory, which is promised. To
be briefe, there is no bitternesse
so great, vvhich the Prophets
meale will not sweeten, which
the wisedom of the tree of lyfe
will not make sauory. Wee are
to knowe, that the worlde is to
be eschewed for foure causes,
the first of which is,The world is to bee eschewed for 4 causes. because
wise and circumspect men, are
wont to flie and auoyd infectious
and contagious places, especially
if they be weake and
sickly, or feare any infirmitie.
Such a place is the VVorlde,
which hath in it many euills, &
many diseases of sin, we see also
much filthines, & many blemishes
in it, which cōtaminate &
pollute our soules: for sinne it

selfe is a contagious disease,
therefore not without cause we
ought to eschew & auoyd the
societie and company of wicked
and vngodlie men; for it
is not meet, that the whole and
sounde should dwell with the
leaprous and diseased: for the
Wise man saith: Hee that toucheth
pitch, shall be defiled with
it, and he that companieth with a
proude man, shal put on pride.
                  
                  Certainly saith S. Ierom, nothing
dooth so hurte a man as
naughty company,Tom. 9. Epi. Euseb. ad Damasum de morte Hieron. and euil society.
For a man becomes such
a one, as the company he keepeth.
The Wolfe dooth neuer
dwel with the lamb: & a chast
man doth flie the company of
the luxurious. I think it impossible,
that a man shoulde long
cōtinue honest, who daily vseth
the societie of wicked mē. With
the holy, thou shalt be holy, sayth

the Psalmist, with the innocent,
thou shalt be innocent, and with
the frowarde, thou shalt learne
frowardnes. For as euill companie
hurteth, so good company
profiteth. Nothing can bee
compared to thys treasure. He
that findeth good society, findeth
life, and aboundeth with
wealth. I speake truly and confidently;
a man is made verie
sildome eyther good or euill,
but through company & society.
The hart of a chyld, is said
to bee as a Table in which nothing
is paynted. Therefore
that he receiueth from company,
hee keepeth till his old age,
whether it bee good or euill.
These things spake S. Ierome,
beeing ready to yeelde vp the
ghost. Therfore seeing that the
worlde is so euill, wee ought to
eschewe and auoyde it, as an ill
neighbour, who can worke vs

great mischiefe by hys neighbourhoode
and vicinitie, and
hurte vs very much by sinnes
and sinners, of vvhich it is full.
                  The second cause vvhy the
worlde is to be eschewed,The second cause why the world is to be eschewed. is,
because vvise and considerate
men doe auoyde those places,
in which they feare the intrappings
and snares of theyr enemies,
least they fall into theyr
hands: and thys is the revvard
that the world rendereth vnto
her louers, that shee at the
length deliuereth thē into the
hands of the deuils theyr deadly
enemies. The wordes of the
the traytour Iudas are to be referred
hether, saying to them,
to whom hee sold and betrayed
the Sonne of God:Math, 26, 
                     Whomsoeuer
I shall kisse, and say peace
be vnto thee, that is he, lay hold
on him. VVhich vvordes the
world saith also to the deuils: to

vvhomsoeuer I shall gyue the
kisse of peace, of riches, of pleasures
and honors, lay holde on
him, binde him hand & foote,
and cast him into hell. Wherfore,
S. Gregory saith not without
good cause;Gregory in his morrals. It is a manifest
signe of perdition, whē the
effect and euent, dooth fauour
affected iniquitie, and no contrarietie
dooth hinder, what the
peruerse minde hath cōceiued.
And Saint Ierome sayth: It is
a manifest token of damnation,
to bee loued of the vvorld,
to enioy prosperity, & to haue
all things, what the vvill desireth.
                  Certaine therefore it is, that
they are exceedingly deceiued
in finding out the way to felicitie,
who thinke that they may
enter into glory, and into the
kingdome of heauen, by riches
and pleasures.
                  
                     The third cause,The thyrd cause. why vvee
ought to eschew the worlde, is
this, because wise & wary men
doe flie & auoyde dangerous
places, such as the sea is, wherin
we saile with feare. Whervpon
the Wise-man saith;Ecclus, 9 
                     They that
saile ouer the sea, doe tell of the
dangers of it. Dauid certifieth
vs,The worlde is a sea. that thys world is a great &
spacious sea, in which the greater
parte of the marriners perrish.
Thys is manifest, because
as Bernard saith, many do miscarry
in it, and fewe are saued.
The worlde is as an Ocean, in
which of foure shyps, scarcelie
one is saued; as the Deluge, in
vvhich so many thousand men
were drowned, and so fewe escaped:
and as the Fornace of
Babylon kindled with hell fire,
in which a man is sette on a
light flame with one word of
the fire of vvrath, in vvhich

luxury dooth burne, and couetousnes
is inflamed by the onely
looke and aspect.
                  The fourth cause, vvhy we
ought to forsake the world,The fourth cause, is,
because euery man that is wise,
beeing admonished, ought to
eschew that place, in which his
mortal & deadly enemy dwelleth.
Thys place is the vvorld,
which the deuill our capitall enemie
inhabiteth; hee hath his
signory and dominion in thys
world, who alwayes threatneth
destruction vnto vs, and thyrsteth
for our deathes. Therfore
let vs flye from the worlde, as
from the deuill, according to
the counsell of the VViseman,
Keep thee far from the man that
hath power to slay.
                     Ecclus, 9,
                  
                  These reasons thus beeing
sette before our eyes, let vs bee
wise: for we see manifestly by
these things which haue beene

spoken, that the world cannot
be better ouercome by any other
way, then by flying from
it. VVee haue an example of
thys in the lifes of the Fathers,
of Achrimus, who being Emperour,
& standing in his pallace,
prayed thus vnto GOD.
Lord I desire thee, shewe vnto
me the way of saluation. And
behold, hee heard a voyce saying
vnto him; Achrimus, auoyde
the concourse and solemnities
of the worlde, entangle
not thy selfe in the snares of
humaine vanities, & thou shalt
be safe. At the hearing of which
voyce, hee betooke himselfe
foorth-with to a strict solitarie
course of lyfe. And saying an
other time the same prayer, he
hearde a voyce saying: Fly, ouercome,
bee silent & at rest.
And surely these be the rootes,
and the grounds not to sinne.

For by flying, the cōcupiscence
of the flesh is ouercome, by being
silent, the pride of lyfe, and
by beeing of a peaceable and
quiet mind, couetousnesse, &
greedines of gaine are subdued
and ouerthrowne.
                  Saint Isidore admonishing
vs that wee shoulde contemne
the world, sayth: If thou desirest
to lyue quietly, couet nothing
that is in this world: cast
frō thee what-soeuer may hinder
thy holy purpose. Be dead
to the world, and therefore being
deade, doe not thyrst after
glory, and thou shalt lyue in
tranquilitie and rest, being cō
                     tent
with thine owne. Despise
that in thy life, which thou
canst not keepe in thy death.
S. Augustine speaketh thus of
this deceitfull world:August. in his medita. This life
is a miserable life, a fraile life, an
vncertaine life, a painefull life,

an impure lyfe, a lyfe Lady of
enormities, & Queen of pride,
ful of miseries & errors: which
is not to be called a life, but a
death in which wee die dailie,
through sundry defections of
mutability, and by manifolde
kinds of death. A brickle lyfe,
an incōstant life, which the faster
it goeth on, the nerer it approcheth
to death, a deceitfull
and vnsteady life, full of the
snares of death. Although it be
replenished with these, and other
greeuances, sorrowes, and
inconueniences, yet (ô greefe)
howe many dooth it ensnare
with vanities, and howe many
are deceiued with false and deceitfull
promises? And albeit
of it selfe it is so false and bitter,
that it cannot cōceale these
incōueniences from her blinde
louers, yet it maketh drunk an
infinite multitude of fooles

with the golden cup, which she
beareth in her hand. As they
are happy, so are they rare, that
refuse her familiarity; that despise
her perfunctory ioyes:
that contemne her society, least
with this perishing deceiuer
they bee also forced to perrish.
This sayth he. Beholde, sayth
Bernard,Bernard. the worlde cryeth, I
shall fayle thee; and the flesh
crieth, I shal infect thee: which
then, ô miserable sinner, vvilt
thou follow? the failing world,
or the infecting flesh? Both of
them are euill: therefore followe
Christ, who will refresh
thee. But if all these thinges,
my Brother, which thou hast
hetherto read of, do not moue
thee, heare what the same famous
Doctor of the Church,
Bernard sayth, of the louers of
the world:In his meditations. Woe be vnto those
vnhappy and wretched ones,

saith he, for whom is prepared
intollerable sorrow, incomparable
stinch, and horrible feare.
Woe bee to them, for whom is
prepared that place, where nothing
shall be heard but vveeping
and wayling, lamentation
and howling, mourning &
gnashing of teeth: where nothing
shall bee seene but the
worme, vgly, deformed, and
horrible tortures, and terrible
& fearefull deuils: where they
shal cal & seeke for death, but
shal not find it: where there is
no order, but where perpetual
horror euerlastingly abideth.
How great feare, how great sorow,
how great mourning will
there be, whē sinners are seperated
frō the righteous, & deliuered
to the power of deuills,
with whom they shall be cast
headlong into the eternall tormēts
of hel, without hope euer

to see the face of the Lorde, or
heauenly glory: without any
hope to bee euer freed from
those torments; where neyther
the torturers shal be wearied,
nor the tortures haue any
ende: where death shall neuer
die, nor lyfe bring any ioy?
                  Tell mee ô sinner,Ierom vpō the 17, of Mathew. sayth S.
Ierome, if we had the wisedom
of Salomon, the beauty of Absolon,
the strength of Sampson,
the long life of Enoch, the
riches of Craesus, and the felicitie
of Octauian: what would
these things profit vs, when as
our fleshe at the length is to be
giuen to the wormes of the
earth, and our soules to the deuils,
to bee euerlastingly tormented
with the rich Glutton
in hell?
                  The shortnesse of time, the
breuity of life, and the vncertainty
of death ought to moue

thee to contemne the worlde,
& those vaine delights that be
in the world. Wherefore Saint
Gregory sayth:Gregory. Reprobates
doe many things wickedly, because
they hope to liue long
heere. Contrariwise, the righteous,
whilst they consider the
shortnes of theyr lyfe, they auoyde
the sinnes of pride and
vncleannesse. Of the breuity
of this life S. Iames saith,Iames, 4. 
                     What
is your life? it is euen as a vapour
that appeareth for a little tyme.
                  
                  And Saint Augustine sayth,August. vpon the 56. psalme.
If thou haddest lyued all that
time, since Adam was expelled
out of the garden of Paradice,
euen to this day, certainly thou
shouldest well perceiue, that
thy life was not perpetuall,
vvhich hath so passed avvay:
but the lyfe of one man what
is it? adde as many yeeres as it
pleaseth thee, adde a very long

and lasting old age, what then?
Is it not yet morning? Bee it
that the day of Iudgement is
farre of; assuredly thy last day
cannot bee farre of, therefore
nowe prepare thy selfe; for as
thou departest out of thys life,
so shalt thou bee presented to
the other lyfe. Thys sayth hee.
And in another place: All the
time that wee liue heere, is taken
from life: so that the lyfe
present is none other thing,
but a short way, by which wee
passe vnto death,Seneca in his 59. epistle. in which no
man can long stay nor linger,
or walke softly, and at leysure;
but euery day thou must finish
by little and little some part of
thy iourney.
                  All things passe away, sayth
Soneca, and are in continuall
diminution & augmentation.
None of vs is the same in olde
age, that wee vvere in youth.
                  
                     Not any one of vs is the same
in the morning, that wee were
the day before. Our bodyes
passe away after the manner of
running riuers: vvhatsoeuer
thou seest, runneth away with
the time. Nothing remayneth
steadie of all those thinges vve
see: behold they are changed,
whilst I speake, and I also am
changed. And in another
place;In his book of consolatiō to Mat. chap. 22. The Fates doe ply their
worke, and doe take away frō
vs the sence and feeling of our
death; and that death may
creepe vpon vs more easily, it
lurketh vnder the very name
of life. Childhood cōuerts infancie
into it, youth childhood,
manly age youth, and olde age
takes away manly age. The very
increases, if thou doost well
account & thinke of them, will
be founde to be losses. If (my
deere Brother) thou lettest

these thinges into thine eares,
and meditatest on thē in thine
hart, & well considerest them,
thou wilt say, that thou rather
runnest vnto death, then that
thou canst hope for long lyfe.
               
               
                  The fift Meditation, for Friday:
of the vanitie of the glory, and
magnificence of this
world.
                  THE Prophet Baruch,
detecting and laying open
the great and intollerable
mockerie of
vaine glory and riches, and the
subtile deceits of this vvorlde,
in the third chapter of his prophecie
sayth; Where are the
Princes of the Heathen, and such
as ruled the beastes vppon the
Earth?Baruch, 3, They that had their pastime
with the foules of heauen,

and hoarded vp siluer and golde,
wherein men trust, and made none
end of their gathering? For they
that coyned siluer, and were so
carefull of their worke, and whose
inuention had none end, are come
to naught, and gone downe to hell,
and other men are come vp in
their steades. Where are the inuincible
victors, and heroicke
conquerours of Coutries, who
by theyr conquests purchased
such tryumphs, and by their riches
prepared such magnificent
feastes and banquettes?
Where are the Emperours and
Captaynes of huge Armies?
Where are the managers & tamers
of horses and other creatures?
vvhere are the Iudges,
tyrants, & great theeues of the
world? they are novv nothing
but dust and ashes. Looke and
looke againe, looke I say into
theyr Sepulchers, whether this

is a rich man, or that a poore
man? Whether this man is valiant,
or that man faint-harted?
tosse & turn ouer their bones,
distinguish if thou canst a rich
man from a poore man, a valiant
man frō a coward, a beautifull
man from him that is deformed.
Wherfore my brother,
let vs be wise at the last, being
admonished by this Scripture:
and let vs assuredly persvvade
our selues that all mans glory,
whence soeuer it commeth, is
to be auoided of vs.Why worldly felicity is to be eschewed. First: because
of his owne nature it is
vile: secondly, because it is deceitfull
in his promises: thirdly,
because it is vaine, brickle,
frayle, fleeting and momentany:
fourthly, because it is euill
and malicious in rendering a
reward. First I say, that mans
glory is to be eschewed, because
of his owne nature and condition

is vile and base; as it is manifest
in the first booke of the
Macchabees, where Mattathias
dying sayth to his Sonnes;
Feare not yee the wordes of a sinfull
man;1, Macca. 2. for his glory is but dong
and vvormes. VVhat in this
world is more filthy thē dong?
What more vile then wormes?
Therefore if all mans glorie
consisteth in dong, it is not to
be desired, but auoyded. Mans
glorie,A simily. as the Phylosopher
sayth, is as corruption and the
rottennesse of vvood. Which
thing also experience teacheth
vs: for as the little vvorme
Teredo, that eateth vvood, in
the night shyneth, and maketh
a crackling, but in the
day time is knovvne to bee a
worme & putrefaction: so also
vayne glory shineth and glittereth
vvith great pompe in the
night of this world to weak &

dimme eyes, vvhich cannot
iudge but by outward appearances.
But when that cleare
and bright day of iudgement
shall come, wherein God shall
reueale the darkest and obscurest
thinges of our soules, and
shall manifest the secret counsailes
of our harts: then those,
that seemed happy and glorious,
shall be knowne to be filthy,
vile, and without any hope
of saluation. Wherefore these
mighty mē are like vnto Owls,
which flying in the darke doe
seeme to cast some light from
them, but when the day ariseth
they show blacke, as they are.
If these gloriosoes had eyes to
looke into theyr most vile riches,
and to behold the stinch
and corruption of their owne
flesh, which shall be turned into
ashes, they that are nowe
swelled and puffed vp, and doe

despise others, through the noblenes
of their birth, theyr power
and dignity, should well
perceaue hovve abiect, base,
blacke, and corrupt they are.
Wherefore I cannot be induced,
to thinke otherwise, but
that if they would deeply consider
and weigh these thinges,
they would presently cast out
of their harts al the earthly glory
of this world:In an Epistle to Iulia. chap. 4. knowing, as
Hierome saith, that it is impossible,
that any one should be
happy in both worlds, and appeare
glorious both in heauen,
and in earth.
                  Secondly,The glory of ye world is vnconstant. the glory of thys
world (as we sayde) is to be eschewed,
because it is fraile, and
without any cōstancy or foundation:
therfore it is like vnto
a smoke, or a vapour, which the
higher that it is lifted, the lesse
it is seene: and to a flower of a

good sent and fairenes, which a
little Sun-shyne dooth dry vp
in a short time; is vvithered
with a little blast of wind, and
dooth loose all the beauty and
fragrancy. Such is the glory
of the vvorld, of vvhich Esaias
sayde: All flesh is grasse, and all
the grace and glory thereof is as
the flower of the field.Esay, 40. The grasse
withereth, the flower fadeth, and
the glorie thereof passeth away.
Such are the louers of thys
temporall momentany glory:
vvorthily compared to grasse,
vvhich grovveth on the topps
of houses to day greene, and to
morrow not seene. VVherefore
the Wiseman sayth:Ecclesiasticus, 10. 
                     All
power is of short continuance; and
hee that is a King to day, to morrow
is dead. Tell me where is
the povver and glory of King
Assuerus, vvho gouerned an
hundred and tvventy prouinces?

VVhere is the glorie of
great Alexander, at whose presence
the vvhole earth vvas
husht,1, Maccha. 1 to vvhom all Kings and
Tyrants payed tribute, as it is
in the first Booke of the Macchabees?
VVhere is the glorie
of that great Empyre, by
vvhich he conquered and subdued
vnder him almost all the
Kingdomes of the vvorlde?
Where are all the Princes and
Potentates of the vvorld, vvho
raigned ouer both man and
beast? They are passed and
gone avvay, as a straunger or a
Soiournour that tarryeth but
for one day. Trulie not one of
them remaineth, all their dayes
vvere spente in vanitie, and
theyr yeares svviftly posted avvay.
                  Death feareth no man: it swepeth
all avvay without any difference
or partiality: it is a

fierce cruell beast, that spareth
not any body, it taketh avvay
both the king and the begger,
and maketh all equal & alike.
                  Thirdly,The glory of ye world is deceitfull. the glory of thys
world is to be auoided, because
it is deceitfull, and dooth performe
none of those thinges it
promiseth, but deceaueth all
men in this life. Which of the
Princes, and Emperours hath it
not deluded, promising vnto
them long life, peaceable honours,
a quiet empire, when as
it cannot prolong mans lyfe
one houre? VVho in earthly
glory was lyke vnto Alexander,
who was neuer subdued in
any warre, who alwayes triumphed
ouer his enemies, vvho
ouerthrew huge hoasts with a
litle army, who neuer besieged
Citty, but he tooke it, neyther
was there any prouince, which
did not obey his Empire? But

now when he seemed an absolute
conquerour, and purposed
to passe the rest of his time
in peace and tranquillity, hee
vvas on a suddaine poysoned.
Tell mee why doest thou follow
and hunt after the glory of
the world, which cannot succour
thee in death?
                  Fourthly (as I said) humaine
glory and applause is to be auoyded
and eschewed,The glory of ye world is euill and malicious in retribution. because
it is a very euill and naughty
pay-mayster: for it promiseth
glory, and payeth euerlasting
perdition, and eternall confusion.
Wherfore the Lord saith
by the Prophet; I will turne
their glory into shame.
                     Ose, 4. So theyr
strength shall bee turned into
weakenes, their wisedome into
foolishnes, and their pleasures
into punishments. For according
to the quantity of the falt,
shall be the quantity of the punishment,

vvhich they shall be
tormented vvith. Heereupon
Saint Hierome speaketh thus
to the louers of this fleeting
and deceitfull vvorld; Woe
bee vnto you miserable vvretches,
vvho endeuour to goe to
heauen by the vvay of riches
and pleasures, and vnderstand
not vvhat our Sauiour sayth:
That it is easier for a cammell to
goe through the eye of a needle,Math. 19.
then for a rich man to enter into
the kingdome of heauen. Remember
that this is a Diuine
sentence, and the words of him
who sayth; Heauen and earth
shall passe, but my words shall not
passe. O miserable vvretches,
and more inconstant then any
wind; howle & mourne; who
are onely great and noble by
the benefit of fortune; but in
deed are base, abiect and blind
vvith the smoake of vanitie,

with deceaueable honours, and
false dignities of this vvorlde.
Doe yee not see the shortnes
of time, howe death perhaps
this might shal cut off the thred
of your liues, and that yee shall
be tormented for euer in hell,
vvhere yee shall alwayes liue,
dying without end, yea more
dying, then all the men that
die in the world? vvhere no rest
shall be giuen, but torments
shall alwayes liue to reuenge?
Where yee shall not onely be
tortured with men, but also
with deuils? For so much the
greater shall thy punishment
be there, as thy glory was greater
here, & as thou hast liued in
greater delicacies and delights.
See how our Sauiour, that vnchāgable
truth, al whose deeds
& words are one instruction,
amōg his twelue apostles, whō
he choose, would haue but one

Bartholomew a noble man, &
one Matthew a rich man: hee
chose all the other poore men,
and fishers: that he might signifie
that the noble and rich
men of this world, can hardly
be saued, and be made worthy
of heauen. For if by one onely
sinne man became guilty of
hell fire: how shall a rich man
be saued, desirous and greedy
of populer applause, hunting
after the fraile and mortall glory
of this life, which is none other
thing, then a filthy & impure
vessell and receite for all
sinne, full of pride and luxury,
full of couetousnes in the rich,
mighty and noble men of this
world? These are theeues, that
robbe the poore of that they
should liue by, vvho eate vp
their labours, killing and treading
them vnder theyr feete:
vvhen notvvithstanding God

hath blessed them vvith great
aboundance of vvealth, that
they therby might nourish the
poore, and religiously rule ouer
them; who being drowned
in riches, and delicats, and swollen
with costly meates, seeing
the poore before their Pallace
gates naked, and perrishing
through hunger and cold, doe
not stretch out their hands vnto
them, neyther are mooued
vvith any pittie: but gyuing
themselues vvholie to playes,
sportings, gamings, feastings,
and banquets, vtterly forget the
poore, the charge of whom is
so often committed and commended
vnto thē in the Scriptures▪
neither doe they remember
God at any time, except
perhaps lightly and by the way
cursorily & perfunctorily. Let
them certainly perswade themselues,
and remember these

things, when they shall feele &
try them, that a most strict and
exact aceount shal be required
of them, vvhy they haue not
destributed to the poore those
things, which were superfluous
vnto them: and if they
cannot giue an account, nor
purge themselues, their soules
shall suffer intollerable torments
in the deepest pit of hel.
O how easily doe they offend,
and howe suddainly are they
envvrapped in punishment,
vvho doe not consider, hovve
they must dye, or howe God
shall iudge them? O how vncircumspect
and vnhappy are
they, that do not remēber these
thinges, and doe not resist the
temptations of the deuil: I dare
boldly affirme, that if they did
acknowledge God to be their
Iudge, & think that they shold
die, that they wold not sinne, at

the least with so great security,
all feare set apart. But now they
come to Church, not to heare
the diuine word, & to pray, but
to see vanity, beuty, & the pride
of womē. This is their thought,
this their intent, & this their sermon.
There they talk & confer,
how they may heape riches
together: there they dispute of
the sundry fashions of apparel:
there they inuite one another
to feasts & banquets, & to the
dishonest delights of gluttony:
of whom S Bernard sayth; O
wretches what do yee, who before
the time do slay your own
soules, & corrupt and putrifie
your bodies? Tell me, whence
comes infirmity, whence groweth
the sodaine death of yong
men, but of great aboundance
of meats, & immoderate venery?
Wretched are ye because ye
think that ye can delude God,

but in truth yee deceaue your
selues▪ because yee neglect your
soules that yee may pamper
your bodies; & so yee destroy
them both, before the time appoynted.
Your pleasure and
reioycing shall continue but
that short time, yee liue, but after
death your bewaylings and
torments shall endure with deuils
in hell for euer and euer:
there shal be euerlasting shame
and confusion: there shal neither
be sumptuous banquets,
nor delicate wines: there with
the rich Glutton, who in thys
world fared delicatly, yee shall
craue a drop of cold water, and
it shall not be giuen vnto you:
for there no man gathereth, or
reapeth any thing, but that hee
hath sown in this world. What
then ô miserable man doest
thou? Why doest thou not repent?
Why doest thou not amend

thy life? O hart harder
then a rocke, why doest thou
linger? Why doest thou deferre
repentance for thy sinns?
Why doest thou prorogue thy
cōuersion? Behold how death
commeth, running swiftly to
carrie thee avvay: the deuill
standeth ready, to catch thy
soule, and the wormes greedily
expect thy flesh, which thou
hast fatted vvith so fine cates,
that they may haue more aboundant
and more toothsom
foode. Doth not that horrible
and fearefull day of iudgment
come into thy mind, in vvhich
thou shalt not onely render a
most stricte account of thy
pride, gluttony, luxury, vayne
glory, vanity, and of thy time
vnprofitably spent; but also of
euery idle word? Beware that
thou fall not into that dreadful
condemnation, which the Son

of God not now a Lambe, but
a Lyon shal pronounce against
the cursed,Math. 25. saying: Depart from
me ye cursed into euerlasting fire,
which is prepared for the deuill
and his angels. Beholde, sayth
Bernard, ô thou worldly sinner,
how farre thou wanderest
out of the way, if in this world
thou seekest for honours, pleasures,
and glory: for thou shalt
neuer finde that heere, which
may satisfie thee. If thou desirest
true ioy and true glory, endeuour
and labour to goe to
heauen by the right way; wher
the ioyes are truer and better,
then euer eye hath seene, or
eare hath heard, or hath at any
time entred into the heart of
man; I pray thee for those eternall
and euerlasting ioyes,
neglect and basely account of
these transitory and momentary
pleasures.
                  
                     But what shall wee say of
them, who can neyther be induced
by the feare or loue of
GOD, nor by the terrour of
death, nor by the horrour of
hellish tormentes, to forsake
theyr sinnes, yea, vvhom it repenteth
that that they haue not power
and abilitie to liue as wickedly
as they would, that they
might satisfie theyr lustes in all
thinges? O miserable wretches,
yee laugh in this vvorld, but
yee shall weepe in the other.
VVoe bee vnto you, who desire
momentanie and fading
pleasures, because yee shall suffer
greate and euerlasting torments.
A lyttle tyme yet remayneth:
fill vppe the measure
of your iniquityes and miseries,
that the indignation of
GOD may bee more plentifullie
powred dovvne vppon
you. Reioyce a lyttle,

giue ouer your selues to tryflings,
to toies, fables, sportings,
lyes, contentions, and enmities,
and let no time passe you in
vaine. What doe yee? Scrape
together for your children riches,
honours, and dominions:
purchase nobility & renowne
for them, that they may doe
that, which yee left to doe, and
finish, what yee began: that
yee together vvith them may
be tortured vvith greater torments.
                  But some man may say:An obiection. God
is bountifull, gracious & mercifull,
hee receaueth euery sinner
that turnes to him with all
his hart, and he pardoneth all
their faults.The aunswer. True it is my brother,
he is more mercifull, then
thou supposest, when he so patiently
suffereth sinners, and so
mercifully granteth thē space
to repent in, that they may amend

themselues: and if they
returne vnto him, he graciously
receaueth them.
                  But I would haue thee to
know, that as he is mercifull in
suffering, expecting, and pardoning:
so he is iust in correcting
and punishing. If thou
shalt say: Albeit a man sinne
all his life time▪ neither doe any
good at all, if hee repent at the
very point & instance of death
God will forgiue him all hys
sinnes. O my brother, hovve
vaine is this comfort?How dangerous it is to defer repentance to the houre of death. Howe
false & deceitfull is this cogitation?
for of an hundred thousand
sinners, that defer their repētance
to the houre of death,
scarsely one is saued, and obtaineth
remission of his sinnes. A
man borne in sinne, neuer lyuing
according to the lavve of
the Lord, without the knowledge
of him, neuer willing to

heare the worde of God, not
knowing what sinne is or what
repentance is, drowned in the
businesses and cares of thys
world: afflicted with the loue
of his children, whom hee leaueth:
with the griefe of his riches,
which he forsaketh: tormented
without hope euer to
enioy them again, what repentance
can he make: who if any
hope of longer life or recouery
did appeare vnto him, would
not be any whit carefull for repentance?
Of which I inferre,
that hee that in his youth, and
whilst hee is whole and sound,
neither feareth, nor blusheth to
offend God, is vnwoorthy to
haue his sinns forgiuen him in
the agony of death.Late repentance sildom true. For tell me
what repentance is that, which
a man maketh, when he plainly
seeth, that he can liue no longer?
yea, who would liue more

dissolutly, then he did before, if
hee should recouer his former
health? Truly I my selfe haue
seene very few rich men, who
haue repented at the houre of
death, and recouering agayne
bodilie health, haue not afterwardes
beene woorse in theyr
soules, then they were before.
This I am assured and altogether
perswaded of, and I haue
learned it by long experience
and obseruation, that they that
alvvayes sinne vvithout anie
feare, and neuer in health will
sette sinne at defiance, nor renounce
theyr pleasures, that
they sildome and very hardlie
haue an happy ende, as sayth
Saint Hierome. VVherefore
my Brother, if thou hast any
discretion, or if there bee anie
light of reason within thee, despise
and forsake the riches, honours,
and glorie of this world,

for his sake who created thee,
and who is ascended aboue all
things. VVhat shall it profit
thee, if thou gainest the whole
world, and loosest thy soule? I
knowe assuredly that the honours
and glory of this world
are impediments of grace, and
that which is worse, hinderers
of eternall saluation. For it is
no where reade, that euer any
man passed vnto eternall glory
by the pleasures and delights
of this world. O howe vaine
and false is the glory, vvhich
men hunt after, and desire one
of another, and not of God?
He that desireth to be preferred
before all men, it is to bee
feared, least the higher hee ascends,
the greater will bee his
fall. That Angell, was a Cittizen
and an inhabitant of heauen,
who said; I will ascend into
heauen,Esay, 14. & exalt my throne aboue

beside the starres of God: I will
sitte also vppon the mount of the
Congregation in the sides of the
North. I will ascend aboue the
height of the cloudes, and I will
bee like the most high: But hee
vvas made a deuill, and fell
into the deepest pitte of hell.
Therefore it is very well sayde
of Saint Augustine; O howe
happie is hee, vvhose heart
onelie burneth vvith a desire
of heauenlie glorie? Who is
not puffed vp in prosperitie,
nor cast downe in aduersitie?
Who as hee hath nothing in
the vvorlde, that hee loueth, so
hee hath nothing that hee feareth?
VVhat other thing is
the glory of this worlde, but a
tickling of the eares? O how
cursed is he, sayth Anselmus,
and ingratefull, that seeketh
for the glorie of thys vvorlde?
No honour is gotte vvithout

trouble, no dignitie vvithout
disturbance, no highnes without
vanity. Wherfore, my brother,
if thou wouldest weightily
consider of the great danger,
that follovveth vvorldly
glorie, vvithout doubt thou
wouldest shunne and flie from
all the vanity of this vvorlde:
and thou vvouldest onely desire
to enioy that celestiall beatitude,
vvhich all the Saintes
haue obtayned by so great labours
and afflictions, and now
doe enioy with greater reioycing.
               
               
                  
                  The sixt Meditation for Saterday:
howe death is to be feared:
and that a Christian ought so to
liue, that death may neuer
finde him vnprepared.
                  
                     BE mindfull,
                     Ecclesi. 14. saith the wiseman,
for death dooth not
tarry: the remembrance
of it is the mother of many
good things: for the same
Wiseman saith:Ecclesiast. 7. 
                     Remember the
end, and thou shalt neuer doe amisse.
And Saint Bernard saith:
Continuall remembrance of
death is a great blessing.Bernard. Let a
man alwayes carry this about
with him, and hee shall neuer
offend. And Saint Augustine
sayth:Augustine. There is not any thing,
that more forciblie holdeth a
man from sinne, then the continuall
remembrance of death.

This maketh a man humble &
lowly: this bringeth a cōtempt
of earthly things, & induceth a
man to take vpon him the burden
of repentance. S. Hierome
also doth subscribe vnto these,Hierome.
saying; Hee that perswadeth
himselfe that he shall dye, easily
contemneth all things: he despiseth
the pride of lyfe, who
remembreth that ere long hee
shall be cast into the earth: for
hee that knoweth that shortly,
he must be put vnder all mens
feet, & be troden vpon by euerie
one, he will not desire to be
extolled, or to be lifted aboue
others: he that remēbreth that
he must leaue all things by and
by, contemneth the lust of his
eies; but especially he despiseth
the concupiscence of the flesh,
vvho considereth that after a
short time his body shal be deuoured
of the vvormes of the

earth. I wold to God, saith S. Ierome,
that the kings & Princes
of the earth, and the possessors
of the riches of this worlde,
wold cōsider, how after a short
space of time they shall be carried
out of theyr magnificent
Pallaces, and be enclosed & included
in a very narrow corner
of a roome: how they shall be
caried out of their glistering &
famous buildings into a darke
& obscure Sepulcher: out of
their golden & gilded houses,
painted with most beautiful &
most plesant flowers & picturs
into a Sepulcher replenished
with crawling worms, & intollerable
stink: out of their Pallaces
full of all the fine furniture
& riches of this world into
an empty and hollow Sepulcher:
out of Pallaces, in which
a company of children and a
troup of seruants daily attēded,

into a solitary, desert forsaken
Sepulcher, seperated from all
society and resort of men. Tell
mee, where remayneth all that
forepassed glory and pompe?
Where is the multitude of seruants
and attendants, that were
wont to follow them? Where
are their costly & delicate banquets?
They ioyed heere a little
time, and liued in their Pallaces,
in the midst of the delights
of this world; and nowe
worms in a Sepulcher do frollick
and feede on them.
                  Of this remembrance of
death,Petrus Damianus to a Countesse. Petrus Damianus vvryteth
vnto a certaine Countesse,
saying; O that wee would remember,
deare Lady, how the
miserable soule is excruciated
at the point of death with horrible
feare, cruell remorse, and
sharpe piercings, it being now
to depart out of the prison of

the flesh. It shall remember vices
and sins committed, which
are so strictly forbidden: It
shall beholde the precepts of
God, which it hath not obserued
partly throgh negligence,
and partly through contempt;
it shall lament the time spent
without fruit, which was granted
it to repent in: it shall
mourne and bewaile, because
it hath so lately vnderstood the
ineuitable and immutable vengeance
of condemnation. It
shall bee compelled to forsake
and leaue the flesh, it shall desire
to reuoke and recall the
time past, but it cannot, neither
shall it bee heard. Looking
backwardes, it shall see all her
life time, as the tract and step
of one pace. And looking forwards,
seeing so euerlasting an
age of eternity, it shall howle
and cry out, that in so short a

time it did not purchase that
great glory, which the Saintes
shall enioy for euer and euer:
it shall lament that for so small
and momentany a pleasure, it
hath lost the perpetuall felicity
of euerlasting blessednes. It
shall blush & be ashamed, that
for the flesh, which shal be cast
vnto wormes to eate, it neglected
and despised it selfe, which
should haue liued in the society
and felowship of Angels. And
lifting vp the beams of her vnderstanding,
and considering
of those immortall riches of
heauen, and seeing that shee
hath changed them for the miseries
of this life, shee shall bee
exceedingly afflicted, and vtterlie
confounded. VVhen
she shall turne her eyes to view
the vanities of this world, and
the darknes of the earth, shee
shall admire and vvonder at

the brightnes of the light glistering
aboue her, and shall
manifestlie knovve that thys
worlde is night and darknesse.
The breaste shall beginne to
pant and beate,The forerunners of death. the forehead
shall waxe stiffe, whence cold
svveate shall issue: the eyes
shall growe dimme, the eares
deaffe, the nose shall sinke
downe, the nosethrils shall bee
filled vvith filth and corruption,
the countenance shal wax
wanne and pale, the mouth
shall bee distorted and pursed,
the lippes shall grow blew, the
hands cold, the pulse shall faint
and languish, novve beating
neuer a whitte, novve stryking
softlie, and sometymes creeping
lyke a vvorme or a pysmier:
the feete shall vvax cold,
and the whole flesh shal turne
to corruption.
                  Those antecedent tokens of

death neerely approching,Who stand by him that is yeelding vp ye ghost. and
these neerer signes beeing at
hand, the euil works, which she
hath done, the wordes, which
she hath spoken, and the cogitations,
which she hath thoght
vpon, shall also approach: and
both the workes, wordes, and
thoughts, shall be witnesses against
a miserable sinner: they
shall stand in his sight: & will
he nill he, he shall be constrayned
to see them. At the one
side of him there shall bee deuils
present, and at the other
Angells: these shall comfort
him dying, the other shall accuse
him, and both of them
shall earnestly expect, which
of them shall carry him away
with them. If there be in him
signes of piety and contrition,
he shall be glad at the sight of
the Angels, and hee shall take
courage to depart vvith thys

sweete and happie companie.
But if on the left side there shal
bee present so obscure and so
hatefull a multitude of sinns, so
vncleane and stinking, that the
Iudge cannot abide the smell
of them, thē the miserable soule
shall forth-with faint for feare,
it shall bee disturbed with violence
of perturbations, & shall
bee compelled to forsake the
prison of the miserable flesh.
Then the soule shall runne to
the mouth, to the eyes, to the
eares, to the nosethrils; seeking
which way it may get forth, &
finding all thinges shut vp and
closed, it shall breake through,
which when it hath so done,
and shall looke round about,
casting her eyes on euery side,
and seeing her selfe condemned,
shee shall curse and banne
her selfe, exclaiming, and crying
out: O the cursed soule of

one excomunicate of a theefe,
of a Church robber, of an adulterer,
of an vsurer. And whē
the wretched soule shal view
the vvhite and vnspotted garment,
that was giuē her in baptisme,
to be nowe blacker then
pitch, she shal sigh and mourn
vvith greate lamentation and
howling, saying: Woe is mee,
woe is mee miserable wretch;
who hath changed my garmēt?
it was whiter then snow, and
nowe it is blacker then pitch.
Then the deuill will presentlie
step forth, who wil mock thee,
and say; O my soule doe not
meruaile, beholde it is I, that
haue prepared for thee thys
blacke garmeut: with which
vesture the greater part of the
worlde is inuested: to vvhich
thou hast alwayes beene obsequious,
which thou hast credited,
which thou with me hast

imployed thy selfe in, alwayes
follovving myne aduice and
counsaile: therefore with mee
thou shalt for euer dvvell in
mine infernal kingdom: where
there is sorrowe without ioy,
hunger without meate, thyrst
without drinke, darknes without
light, stinke without sweetnesse,
greefe without comfort,
mourning vvithout consolation,
teares without ceasing, hideous
noyse vvithout silence,
howling without melody, burning
fire without refreshing, a
violent wind without calmnes,
heat without ende, and all euill
without any good. Therefore
arise my loue, & goe with me;
behold all the infernal spirites
doe come to meet thee. Then
also shall bee present the Angel
of GOD, to vvhom the
soule was committed, saying;
Happie and blessed are they,

who in this worlde haue not
spotted nor blemished theyr
garments. O vnhappy soule,
ô friend of deuils, ô the cursed
creature of the omnipotent
God. I alwayes stood by thee,
and thou sawest mee not. I alwayes
admonished thee, and
thou wouldest not heare me: I
alwayes suggested good counsailes
vnto thee, and thou wouldest
not beleeue mee. Therefore
now get thee gone to hell
into the handling of deuills:
that is, to the place of torments,
vvhich are prepared for thee
according to thy deserts.
                  Who can expresse the multitude
of hellish fiends, that
with great fiercenes shal runne
to catch the vnhappie soule,
and carrie it to euerlasting torments,
who despitely insulting
ouer it, and mocking it shall
say; O how proude hast thou

beene heeretofore? How delicately
and sumptuously hast
thou banquetted? How finelie
& curiously hast thou been
cloathed? Howe valiant and
prosperous hast thou alwayes
been? Tell vs, why doest thou
not now eate, why doest thou
not drinke, vvhy art thou not
gallantlie apparrelled? Why
doest thou not nowe play and
reioyce with thy wife, children,
and friends? Then the miserable
soule shall curse the bodie,
The soule shall curse the body. saying: O temple of the
deuill, whose works haue polluted
mee: ô cursed earth, ô
habitation of sathan, arise now
and goe with mee, and thou
shalt see the place of torments
prepared for thee: in vvhich
I shall dwell vvithout thee till
the comming of the Iudge:
and then also shalt thou come
hither, and for euer shalt bee

tormented with mee. Cursed
bee thine eyes, vvhich would
not see the light of truth, and
the vvay of righteousnesse:
cursed bee thine eares, which
refused to heare the wordes of
eternall lyfe: Cursed bee thy
nosethrills, vvhich disdayned
to smell the most sweete sauour
of vertue. Cursed be thy
lippes and tongue, and cursed
bee thy mouth, that would neither
taste the ioy of glory, nor
prayse theyr Creatour. Cursed
bee thy handes, vvhich
denyed almes to the poore:
Cursed be thine heart, vvhich
brought foorth so many, and
so vncleane cogitations and
counsayles: Cursed bee thy
feete, vvhich vvould not frequente
the Church of Christ
Iesus: Cursed bee thy members,
vvhich neuer brought
foorth the vvorkes of repentance:

And cursed bee all thy
workes, which haue deserued
so cruell, and so endlesse torments.
                  Consider therefore my brother,
from vvhat great daungers
and feares thou mayst
nowe delyuer thy selfe, if so
novve through the feare of
death thou endeuourest so to
lyue, that when it commeth,
thou mayst say with Dauid:
Into thy handes ô Lorde I commende
my spirite.
                     Psal. 7. Learne novv
to dye to the vvorlde, that
thou mayest lyue vvith Iesus
Christ. Learne nowe to contemne
all thinges, that thou
mayst freelie enter in with Iesus
Christ, and enioy all the
blessings of his glory. Chastice
novve thy body vvith repentance,
that thou mayst then
finde most firme assurance. O
howe happy & prudent is that

man, who laboureth nowe to
be such an one, as hee will desire
to be in that doubtfull and
dreadful houre of death. Therfore
now contend with all thy
might to bee such an one: for
thou knowest not when thou
shalt die, neither what wil happen
vnto thee after death. Doe
not relie eyther vppon thy
friendes, or thy children; for
they will forgette thee sooner,
then thou thinkest: and vnlesse
now thou disposest of all
thinges, who can or will heereafter
dispose of them for thee?
Be carefull and prouident: for
it is better to foresee, and preuent
that day with good preparation,
then to looke for
helpe and ayde of another.
Therfore gather now immortall
goods: giue almes in thys
life, make those holy and blessed
ones thy friends, that when

thou departest hence they may
receaue thee into their euerlasting
habitations.Gregor. de diuersis, cuius initi
                           •
                        m, dignū valde est. For that glorious
Doctour of the Church
Saint Gregory saith; that those
things are with great diligence
to be considered of, and those
works with many teares to bee
meditated vppon, which the
Iudge of the world shall exact
of vs, when that houre of death
shall come. And Saint Bernard
sayth; O my soule, what
feare shal there be, when all are
sent away, whose presence was
pleasant vnto thee, whose sight
acceptable, and whose neighbourhood
so familiar and thou
altogether alone enterest into
that vnknowne region, & shalt
see those vgly & horible monsters
flocking to meete thee?
Who wil succour thee in a day
of so great necessitie? Who
shall defende thee from those

roaring Lyons greedy of theyr
pray? who shal comfort thee?
who shal helpe thee? who shal
conduct thee? But happie is
that soule, which confidentlie
and boldly shall speake to her
enemies in the gate: vvhy standest
thou heere thou cruel and
bloody beast? Thou shalt find
nothing deadly in me: which
shal be entertayned of Angels,
defended from the rage & violence
of deuils, and shal bee
carried into the bosome of Abraham.
Of death and the way
of sinners in an other place also
thus speaketh S. Bernard:
The death of sinners is exceeding
euil.Bernard in Epist 106. And heare why it is
exceeding euil: It is euil in the
losse of the worlde: vvorse in
the seperation of the flesh: but
worst of al in the double torment
of the vvorme, and of
fire. But of al it is exceeding

euil, because the soule shal bee
seperated from the Diuine aspect,
and with great confusion
shal bee for euer depriued
of the sight of God. Consider,
my deare brother, and marke,
that no man can eschew death,
neyther know the houre, nor
change the time appoynted of
God. But the death of the
righteous is good, for they rest
from their labours; better for
the nouelty of the life; but best
of all for the assurance and security
of eternity.
               
               
                  
                  The seauenth Meditation for
Sonday: of the ioyes of the blessed
in heauen, and of the paynes
of the damned in
hell.
                  O Sinfull soule, if these
earthly thinges seeme
vile vnto thee, and of
no price; lift vp thine
eyes, and beholde heauenlie
things: consider with great diligence,
what thinges they be,
and how great, which GOD
hath prepared for the Elect.
For they be such, and so great,
that, as Saint Paul sayth, neither
eye hath seene, nor eare hath
heard, neyther hath entred into
the hart of man. Therefore
wee must knowe, that the delightes
of a blessed lyfe are so
many and so great, that no Arithmetitian
can number them,

no Geomater can measure thē,
neyther can any Grammarian,
Logitian, or Rhetoritian expresse
them, eyther by wordes
or reasons. Seeing neither eye
hath seene theyr greatnes, nor
eare hath heard of them, neyther
at any time haue they entered
into mans heart. There
the Saints shall ioy, beeing circled
and compassed with glorie,
beholding the Diuine essence
aboue them, seeing the
beauty of the heauens, and of
all creatures beneath them,
viewing in thēselues the dignity
of their soules, and glory of
their bodies; and to bee briefe,
hauing about them the societie
and fellowshippe of all the
Angells and blessed Spyrites.
Hence it is that Anselmus
sayth,In his book of Similitudes, from ye 47, chapter, to ye 74. that there are fourteene
partes of that felicity, vvhich
all the Elect shall perfectlie

haue, vvhen that generall session
is ended:Seauen beatitudes appertaining to glorified bodies. seauen of the body,
and as many of the soule:
the first of vvhich is beautie:
for in that lyfe, the beautie of
the righteous shall bee equall
to the beautie of the Sunne,
vvhich shall bee seauen folde
brighter,Beauty. then it novve is.
VVhere-vppon it is written:
That the iust shall shyne,Math. 13. as the
Sunne in the Kingdome of God.
The second shall bee theyr agilitie,
Agility. which shall bee like vnto
that of Angells: for they
shall bee mooued from heauen
to the earth, and from the
earth to heauen, sooner then
we can mooue one of our fingers
vp and downe.A simily. VVe may
beholde an example of this velocitie
in the beames of the
Sunne, vvhich at the Sunne
rysing in the East are in a moment
carryed to the VVest:

that thereby we may consider,
that it is not impossible, which
wee speake of this our future
swiftnesse and celerity, especially,
seeing that greater velocitie
is wont to bee in all thinges
liuing, thē in those things that
are liuelesse. The third part of
their beatitude is fortitude;Fortitude. for
whosoeuer shall be accounted
woorthy to be numbred vvith
the celestiall Cittizens, shal excell
in strength, so that no man
shal be able to resist them. For
theyr fortitude shall be as great
as that of Angells, with whom
they liue in ioy: for as theyr
glory shall be a like, so theyr other
gyfts shall bee a like. The
fourth shall bee free and secure
liberty:Liberty. for as nothing can hinder
Angels, so nothing shall
hinder the Saints, neyther shal
any element whatsoeuer bee able
to resist them.
                  
                     The fift part of theyr beatitude
is health,Health. which shall bee
vvithout infirmitie. Of thys
health of the righteous, vvhat
can bee sayd better, then that
which the sweete Singer of Israel
speaketh;Psalm, 36, saying: The
health of the righteous is of the
Lord. And to whom this sound
and true health is giuen of the
Lorde, what infirmitie can any
way touch them, or come
neere them?
                  The sixt gift of beatitude, is
an ineffable delight,Delight. which shal
make drunke the righteous, &
shal fill them full, and wholy
replenish them with an vnspeakeable
aboundance of inestimable
ioy. What said I, shal
fil them ful, and wholy repleanish
them? yea, theyr eyes, nostrils,
ears, mouth, hands, throat,
lunges, marrow, and theyr very
entrailes, and all and euey

part and member of them shal
be filled with such wonderfull
sence, and feeling of such exceeding
& incomparable pleasure
& delight, that the whole
man shal quaffe of the riuer of
Gods pleasure, and shall bee
made drunke with the plentie
of his house; so that hee shall
stande amazed, and bee altogether
astonished; and those
things that he shall enioy, shal
be so great, that he cannot desire
greater.
                  The seauenth parte,Perpetuitie: shall
bee length and perpetuitie of
lyfe; for whosoeuer he be that
lyueth well now, then hee shal
lyue as long as God. Wherevpon
it is written by the Wiseman;
Wise, 5, 
                     The righteous shall liue
for euer, and theyr rewarde is
with the Lord. Moreouer, the
soule shal also haue seauē beatitudes
which are no lesse glorious,

then those of the bodie.The seauen beatitudes which the soules of the righteous enioy in heauen.
The first is Wisedome, which
in that glory shall be giuen vnto
it: for there the soule of a
simple Artificer, or a plaine
Country-man, shall haue more
vvisedome,Wisedom. then all the Phylosophers
or Wise men of thys
world euer enioyed here. The
righteous shall haue such aboundance
of vvisedom in the
lyfe to come, that they shall be
ignorant of nothing, vvhich
they ought or woulde knowe.
They shall bee filled with all
perfect vvisedome, and shall
beholde GOD face to face.
VVhich vvhen hee shall see,
he shall beholde the nature of
euery creature, which consisteth
better in GOD, then in
it selfe.
                  Then likewise the righteous
shal know and vnderstand
all thinges, which God made

to bee knowne, as well those
thinges that are past, as those
things that are to come.
                  There all shall be knovvne
of euery one, and euery one of
all, neyther shall any man bee
ignorant of what Countrey, of
what Nation, or of what kindred
any man is, or what hee
hath doone in his lyfe.
                  The second beatitude of the
soule,Friendship, shall bee the amitie and
friendship of one to another,
as mēbers of one body, whose
head is Christ Iesus the Lorde.
For God, and all other good
men in that blessed society, shal
so vnfainedly loue euery righteous
man, that they can neuer
hate him. As long and as well,
as a man dooth loue himselfe,
so long, and so well shall hee
loue another that resteth in the
same fellowship with him.
                  But passe ouer these things,

and contemplate him, by whō
these blessings come vnto thee,
and thou shalt perceiue, that
hee dooth and will loue thee
more, then thou canst loue
thy selfe, or any other themselues:
and thou wilt loue him
aboue thy selfe, and aboue all
others.
                  The third shal be concord:Concord.
for the body and the soule of
euery Saint, which disagreed in
thys lyfe, shall then very vvell
agree, and bee at peace and vnitie;
yea, all the righteous shal
haue such agreement and concord,
as our eyes haue in thys
present life. For as one eye
cannot bee turned about,A similie. with
out the other bee also turned,
but they are alwayes turned
together one way, euen so the
bodie and the soule, and the
vvhole congregation of the
righteous, shall will no contrarieties,

but shall alwayes haue
the same vvill. For wee shall
be one body, one Church, and
the spouse of Christ. The will
also of almighty GOD shall
not bee contrary to thine, but
thou shalt wil as he willeth, &
hee shal wil in al things, as thou
willest; for howe is it possible
that the heade should disagree
with his body?
                  The fourth is Honor:Honour. heere
wee are borne of the corruption
of the flesh, filled with many
miseries, destitute of comfort,
subiect to many infirmities
and passions, and ful of the
vlcers of sinne, out of vvhich
GOD shall take vs, and shall
heale vs, and restore vs to perfect
health, and shal adorne vs
vvith the ornament of absolute
righteousnesse and immortalitie;
shall adopt vs for hys

sonnes and children, shal make
vs inhearitours of his kingdome,
and coheires with hys
onely begotten Sonne, our Sauiour,
and shall make vs to bee
called Gods by his own name.
For hee sayth: I haue sayde yee
are Gods,Psalm▪ 82, and yee all are children
of the most High.
                  
                  The fifte beatitude of the
soule,Power, is Power; for the righteous
shall be able to doe, vvhat
they will; because they shall
haue the almightie agreeable
to theyr wills.
                  The sixt beatitude,Securitie. is securitie:
For the righteous in that
blessed estate, shall certainlie
haue and enioy, what soeuer
they doe desire, neyther shall
they haue any feare to loose
that they haue, because neyther
they shall bee willing to
loose it, neither shal God take
it from them being vnwilling.
                  
                     The seauenth and last beatitude
of a glorified soule,Perfect ioy. is
perfect ioy, such as no man can
comprehend; for there shalbe
thousands of thousands, tenne
thousand thousands, and more
then tenne thousand hundred
thousands of thousands of the
righteous, whō none can number,
and all shall enioy and ioy
in the same blessednesse: neyther
shall there be anie, vvhich
shall not as much ioy for an others
felicitie, as for his ovvne.
                  And aboue all this, they shal
reioyce with an admirable ioy;
seeing almighty GOD, whō
they entirely loue, more then
themselues, and whom God
loueth, more then they can
loue themselues. Therefore
theyr ioy shall bee vnmeasurable
ioy shal be vnto them both
within and without, ioy aboue,
and ioy beneath, ioy all about

them, on euery side, and euery
where full of ioy.
                  But as the righteous shall
reioyce by reason of so great
ioy and blessednesse: so on the
contrarie part, sinners shall be
tormented with vnspeakable
tortures. For as beautie, agilitie,
fortitude, libertie, health,
pleasure, and eternitie, is matter
of reioycing vnto the righteous:
so on the contrary part,
the vglines of sinne, the burthen
of it, imbecility, seruitude,
infirmitie, anxietie, and euerlasting
death, shall with continuall
and most greeuous torments
afflict sinners. For that
securitie of eternitie, & the life
which the righteous shall reioyce
in, where they alwaies inioy
the good blessings of God,
shal doubtlesse be a very great
and a perpetuall punishment
vnto the wicked, in which they

shal alvvayes finde, that which
they shal more and more hate.
VVhat shal vvee say of vvisedome?
which as it shall bee a
ioy & an honor vnto the righteous:
so that, which the vvicked
haue knowne, or shall
knovve, shal be vnto thē griefe
and confusion: the friendship
vvhich is ioyned with myrth
and reioycing in the righteous,
shal bee great discord and affliction
vnto sinners: for they
shal haue great discord, especially
with those creatures, which
they heeretofore loued in thys
world, and the creatures shall
haue the lyke with them. And
in the place of the power, that
the righteous shal haue, the
vvicked shal haue such impotencie,
that they shal be able to
doe nothing as they would; so
that by the honor of the Saints
they shal haue eternal cōfusion.
                  
                     Furthermore, as the friendes
of GOD shall be secure, that
they shal not loose theyr blessings,
so the enemies of God
shal loose all hope to bee deliuered
from those torments in
which they lyue; who beeing
created to enioy heauenly glorie,
are now for euer to lyue in
the societie of deuils. To bee
briefe, in stead of the eternall
and ineffable ioy of the righteous,
the wicked shal bee filled
with exceeding sorrowe, because
they shal continually and
without end, suffer ineuitably
all those miseries, vvhich they
shal feele themselues compassed
with. Thys sayth Anselmus,
but much more copiouslie.
                  In this blessednes, as S. Augustine
sayth,Augustine. God shal fil and
satisfie al the sences of the elect
with inestimable ioy and pleasure,

for hee himselfe shall bee
the obiect of them all: he shal
bee a glasse vnto their eyes;
honny vnto theyr mouthes;
musick vnto theyr eares; sweet
Balsamum vnto theyr noses; a
most delicate flower vnto their
hands: for to this purpose God
became man, that euery man
might receiue by him internal
blessednes for his soule, in the
contemplation of his diuinitie,
and external for his body, in
beholding his humanitie.
                  Briefely,August. in his Manuel, chap, 15, according to the
saying both of Saint Augustine
and Gregorie, there shal
be so great beautie of righteousnesse,
and glory of euerlasting
light, that if wee should
suffer torments euery day, if
wee shoulde abide for a long
tyme the paynes and tortures
of hel, that wee might bee admitted
to see Christ in his glorie,

if it were but one day, and
haue felowship with his Saints,
certainely it were worth the
suffering, that wee might bee
made partakers of so great
blessednesse and glory. Therefore
it is sayde not without reason
of the Psalmographer, nor
with a small desire; A day, ô
Lord in thy Courts,Psalm, 84, is better then
a thousand other where. And of
Saint Bernard: Who can cō
                     prehend
in thys lyfe, hovve
great the glory of the Saints of
GOD shal be in the life euerlasting,
who shal see God, and
shal alwaies be with him? who
is al in al? who is the cheefest
good? in whom is exceeding
blessednesse and vnmeasurable
ioy? There is truth, libertie,
loue, & perfect charitie: there
shal bee eternal societie, constant
amitie, and perpetual securitie.
                  
                     Rightly therefore sayth that
reuerend Doctor Saint Augustine;
O ioy aboue all ioy, for
a man to see the face of God,
who hath created, redeemed,
and glorified him: certainely
thys is the ioy of the Angels, &
of the Saints. For as Saint Gregory
saith; GOD is of so admirable
beautie, that the Angels,
who sitte vpon the Sun,
doe stil desire to see him.
                  There as Saint Augustine
sayth,In the sixt chap. of his Manuell. is neyther vvicked men
nor any kinde of wickednesse:
there is no aduersary, nor any
to resist; there is no manner of
enticement vnto sinne, there is
no want, no reproching, no
rayling, no nicknaming, no accusation,
no dissembling, no
feare, no disquietnes, no payne,
no doubting, no violence, no
discord; but there dwelleth aboundance
of peace, fulnes of

charitie, eternall praise and
thanks giuen vnto God, secure
rest without end, and alvvayes
ioy in the holy Ghost.
                  Hast thou heard, ô my soule,
howe surpassing bee the ioyes,
how infinite the mirth, & how
incomparable and incomprehensible
is the light of that
heauenlie Cittie? O happy
ioy, ô true reioycing of the
Saints, who doe continuallie
beholde the face, and alvvayes
possesse the company of God
himselfe. Therfore, ô my soule,
let vs willingly relinquish the
desire of these earthly thinges,
let vs banish out of our hearts,
the ioy of euill thoughts, and
beeing inflamed with the loue
of that celestial and euerlasting
ioy, let vs returne and trauaile
towards the heauenly Cittie, in
which wee are written and appoynted
Cittizens, as of the

houshold of GOD, heyres
of his kingdome of glorie, and
fellow heires with his beloued
Sonne Christ Iesus.
                  If thou demaundest howe
this may be,August. in the 16. chap. of his Manuell. or by what means
and helpe? Heare what I shal
say vnto thee: The matter is
put in the power of the willer
and dooer. The kingdome of
heauen suffereth violence; the
kingdome of heauen, ô man,
demaundeth none other price,
but thy selfe: for it is worth so
much as thou art: giue thy
selfe, and thou shalt haue it.
VVhy art thou troubled about
the price? Remember
that Christ hath giuen himselfe,
that hee might purchase
of GOD his Father a kingdome
for thee, so in like manner
giue thou thy selfe, that
thou mayst enioy this kingdome,
and let not sinne raigne

in thy mortall body, but the
spirite for the obtaining of life.
                  O sinful soule, ô soule ful of
miserie; if these thinges doe
not yet mooue thee, which I
haue spoken of the excellencie
and immensitie of that heauenly
ioy, which the elect of
God doe for euer enioy, that
thou maist purchase it for thy
selfe, both by repentance, and
by diuine grace: Consider, I
pray thee, with great dread &
feare, the most miserable estate,
the intollerable paynes, and the
vnspeakeable torments of hel,
that obscure and diabolical cittie,
that by the horror and terror
of this consideration, thou
mayst bee conuerted vvyth all
thine hart vnto the Lord.
                  Therefore wee must first
know,The paines of hell shall be diuers. that according to the diuersity
of sinnes, shal be the varietie
of punishments. For as

Saint Gregory sayth: VVee
must knowe that there is but
one fire in Hel,In his 4. booke of dialog. cap. 43, and in the 9, book of his morrals, cha. 27 but al sinners
are not tormented in it after
the same manner: for euery
one shal feele so much punishment
there, as he hath sinned
heere.
                  And as in this vvorlde vvee
are al vnder one Sunne,A Simily. yet we
do not feele the heate al alike,
because one is more hote, and
another lesse hote: so there in
that fire, there is not one manner
of burning, because heere
what the diuersitie of bodies
dooth (for after one manner
the fire doth burne chaff, after
another woode, and after another
yron) that there dooth the
diuersity of sinnes: they haue
the same fire, and yet it dooth
not burne al the damned that
be therein alike.
                  That fire shalbe kindled with

the wrath of the Iudge, & shal
burne euerlastingly, neither
shal it neede to bee kindled the
second time: as Iob witnesseth
who sayth: The fire that is not
blowne,
                     chap, 20, or as Pagnine translateth
it, the vnquenchable fire shal
deuour him.
                  
                  Of the crueltie and torment
of thys fire, Sebastian sayth:
That there is as great a difference
betweene materiall fire,
and the fire of hell, as there is
between painted fire on a wal,
and naturall fire.
                  Thys fire shall some-vvhat
shine,The fire of hell shall shine, to the greater torment of the damned. but it shal be no comfort
vnto the damned, but rather a
greater punishment. Wherevppon
Saint Isidore sayth: In
hell there shal be a certaine obscure
shyning, by which the
miserable damned shal be seen,
not that they may reioyce in it,
but that they may be more tormented,

whilst one seeth another.
See Gregory in the 9, booke of his morals. chap, 49. For then the vvicked shal
see those tormented with thē,
whom they haue inordinatelie
loued in this worlde, that they
may nowe suffer punishment
according to the qualitie of the
fault, and that that carnall loue
which was preferred before the
diuine loue, may bee punishment
with like vengeance in
theyr sight.Whether the damned doe see the Saints. Thus also is a
doubt resolued, by which it
was wont to bee demaunded,
whether the damned do see the
glory of the Saints. To which
question Saint Gregory aunswereth
after this maner;In his 40. hom. vpon the Euang. That
sinners may be the more punished
and tormented, they shall
both see their glory whō they
haue despised, and shal be tormented
with theyr paine whō
they haue vnprofitably loued.
For it is to be supposed, that till

the last iudgement, the wicked
doe see the righteous in glory
and rest, that they seeing them
in ioy, may not onely bee tormented
with theyr owne pument,
but with their blessednes.
But the iust shal alwayes
behold in torments the vniust,
that hereby their ioyes may alwayes
increase, because they see
the euill from which by mercie
they are deliuered: and by so
much they shall render greater
thanks vnto theyr Redeemer,
by howe much they see themselues
deliuered from greater
torments.
                  Neyther shall thys sight of
the reprobates miserable and
intollerable punishment, anie
whit dimme the clearenesse of
the blessednes of the righteous:
because where there shal
bee no compassion of misery,
there (without doubt) shal be

no diminution of the blesseds
beatitude.
                  What if it be no meruaile, if
the sight of the damneds torments
bee vnto the righteous
a cause of greater ioy: seeing
that in a picture, a blacke coloure
is layde vnderneath, that
a white or a redde colour, may
be seene more manifestly, and
beare the greater beautie? For
as I sayde before, the ioyes of
the righteous shal so much the
more increase, as they see the
paynes of the damned increased,
from which they haue escaped.
A saued Father shall
not pitty his damned Sonne,
neyther shal the wife be sorrie
for her reprobate husbande.
The damned shall see till the
last iudgement the glory of
the righteous, not that they
shal knowe what it is, but onely
that they shall vnderstand,

that it is an inestimable ioy; &
such an vnderstanding shal be
vnto them both griefe punishment,
and enuie: but after
iudgement for euer they shall
bee depriued of this sight:
which shall bee an exceeding
greeuous torment vnto them,
for they shall alwayes remember
that glorie, which they before
saw, and shall think themselues
vnworthy to behold so
great happinesse.
                  Heere also an other question
ariseth,Whether the damned do see what is doone in this world. whether the damned
doe see what is doone in
thys world? To which S. Gregorie
aunswereth in his Morrals,
saying; They know not
whether theyr children be noble,
or ignoble. As neyther the
liuing doe knowe, what torments
the damned haue. They
knowe not what they are, whō
they haue left in this world, for

the life of their soule is seperated
from their body.
                  Thirdly, it is doubted, whether
the damned doe wish,Whether the damned doe wish that all might bee damned with them. that
all may come into hel to them?
to which doubt it is answered:
As the Saints haue perfect loue
and charity, so the damned doe
burne agaynst all with spight
and hatred. Wherefore as the
Saints doe reioyce at anothers
good, so the damned doe repine
at it, neyther is there anie
thing foūd at which they more
greeue, then at the glory of the
Saints: and therfore they wish
that all might be damned, and
they boile with so great enuie,
that also they enuy the glory
of their own parents, although
lesse, then they enuie other
mens glory:For thys cause yt rich glutton would not haue hys brethren damned. for they knowe,
that the nearer they are vnto
them, who are damned, that
theyr ovvne punishment is so

much the more encreased.
Which albeit they know, yet so
great is their hatred & malice,
that they had rather suffer great
torments with many, then smal
discruciatements with a few.
                  Fourthly, it is wont to be demanded,
Whether the damned shal remember what they haue done in this life. whether the damned
shal be mindful of those things,
which they haue done in this
life, to which S. Bernard answereth
affirmatiuely, & saith; that
this remēbrance shal more torment
thē, whilst they remember
the euils, which they haue
committed, for which they are
nowe afflicted, and the good
things, which they haue omitted,
by which they might haue
purchased the kingdom of heuen.
Hence it is apparent that
there are two kinds of punishment
in hel:Two pun
                           •
                        shments in hell. one of losse, & the
other of sence, as the Diuines
speake. Christ remembreth the

first, when he saith; Euery tree
that bringeth not forth good fruit,
shall be hewen downe. And the
latter, whē he addeth; And shall
be cast into the fire. Of the punishmēt
of sence Gregory speketh,
saying; In hell there shal
be intollerable cold, vnquenchable
fire, an immortal worm, insufferable
stink, palpable darknes,
tormēters with scourges, an
horible sight of deuils, cōfusion
of sinners, & endles desperatiō
of any good. Therfore the dā
                     ned
shal be full of all misery, affliction,
& griefe: for they shal
haue tears in their eyes, gnashing
in their teeth, stink in their
nosthrils, houling in their mouthes,
mourning in their throats,
terrors in their ears, bonds and
manacles vpon their hands &
feet, & eternall fire burning all
their parts & members. Wherfore
not without cause S. Augustine

calleth hel a denne, full of
all kinde of punishments and
miseries. For this cause the
Prophet sayth; Euery one shall
bee astonished at his neighbour,
their countenances shall be blacke
with burning: And Baruch
sayth, That theyr faces shall bee
pitchy and blacke, through the
smoake that is in the house. The
greatnes of the punishments in
hel may bee also gathered, by
the continuall mourning and
lamentation, vvhich groweth
throgh a desire of death, which
shal not come at them, nor nere
them, wherefore they shal bite
their tongues, and blaspheme
theyr Creatour, as Saint Iohn
testifieth,Apoc. 16. saying; They gnewe
their tongues for sorrow, & blasphemed
the God of heauen for
their paines, and for theyr sores.
The rigour of theyr torments
shal be so great, that despising

lyfe, which all so greatly loue,
they shal desire death, which all
men hate, and that very earnestly,
as the same Iohn witnesseth,
when he sayth; In those
dayes shall men seeke death,Apoc. 9. and
shall not finde it, and shall desire to
die, & death shall slee from them.
What then shal wee doe sayth
Chrysostome. For there shall
be none other thing, but mourning,
trembling, and lamentation:
there all repentance shal
be too late, helpe shal be wanting,
punishmēts shal encrease,
neyther is any comfort or consolation
euer to be looked for.
O what terrors, what gripings,
what wearines, and what torments
shal afflict them, that are
boyled in this purgatory? No
tongue can expresse, what punishment
it is, sayth Chrysostome,
to bee depriued of the
Diuine sight. There be some

of an absurde iudgement,
                        
                           〈◊〉
                         reparat. lapsi ad Theod. who
onelie are glad to thinke, that
they shall escape hell. But I
think it a greater torment then
hell, not to haue attayned so
great glorie. I doe not thinke
that vvee are so much to sorrowe
for the paynes of hell, as
wee are to lament our losse, in
that wee are fallen from heauen;
which is a torment in my
iudgement aboue all torments.
Hell, and the plagues of hell
are intollerable: yet if one
should say, that innumerable
hells were to bee suffered, hee
should say nothing, in respect
of the losse of that heauenlie
glory, to be hated of Christ, &
to heare;Hom. 47. ad pop. Antioch. 
                     I know you not. For
it is better to bee pierced thorough
vvith infinite thunderbolts,
then to haue that milde
face turned agaynst vs, and
that peaceable eye disdayning

to beholde vs. O let vs neuer
suffer this, ô thou onely begotten
sonne of God, and of the
blessed Virgine; ô let vs neuer
haue experience of this irrecuperable
losse, and intollerable
punishment. But woe is vnto
vs, in that wee doe not foresee
this imminent danger: yea as
secure, impure, negligent, and
vvithout anie regarde wee hasten
vvith greate celeritie, to
finde out this insufferable and
importable euill.
                  But some man vvill say:Whether it be iustice, to punish a finite sinne with an infinite torment. a
finite sinne ought not to bee
punished vvith an infinite torment.
Almightie GOD is
iust, and that which is finitely
committed, ought not to bee
infinitelie plagued.Lib. 4 Moral. cap. 12. To which
Saint Gregory aunsvvereth;
that hee should say vvell, if
the iuste and stricte Iudge
should recompence & punish

onely the deedes, and not the
hearts of men. For the wicked
did therefore offende finitely,
because theyr lyfe vvas finite.
But they vvould haue lyued
without ende, that they might
haue continued in sinne without
end. For they more desire
to sinne, then to liue: and therfore
they alwayes desire to liue
heere, that whilst they liue they
may neuer cease to sin. Therefore
it belongeth to the iustice
of the strict Iudge, that they
neuer want punishment, who
were minded in this life neuer
to haue wanted sinne: and that
no ende of vengeance should
bee alotted vnto them, vvho
would make no ende of sinning,
while they were able to
offend. This sayth hee. Another
reason is this: The greater
the person is, who is offended,
the greater is the iniurie

and offence, and deserueth the
greater punishment, as both
Aristotle and Chrysostome auerre.
Arist. 7, Ethicorum. For so great is the iniury,
as the person is great, against
whom the iniury is committed.
If the person bee noble,
a small iniurie becomes
great; and if the person be base
and vulgar, a great offence, is
accounted bur smally of. Therfore
because God is infinite in
povver and in goodnes, the iniury
which is offered vnto him,
is also infinite: and therefore
it is requisite and meete, that it
bee punished with an infinite
and eternall torment. Wherefore,
my deare brother, thou
seeing & vnderstanding these
things, & considering of them
daily & diligently in thy mind,
be, I pray thee carefull for the
saluation of thy soule. Let
thine eyes alwayes behold the

cruelty, sharpnes, and greatnes
of the tormentes in hell: alvvayes
meditate vppon those
thinges, vvhich are profitable
and wholesome for thy soule.
For it is much better for thee,
heere without intermission to
lament thy sinnes, and in thys
world with fruit to craue pardon
and forgiuenes of God,
then heereafter for euer to bewaile
them in the vnquenchable
flames of hell, without any
profitte or remedy. In thys
short course and pylgrimage
of thy life, thou maist by teares
and repentance obtayne remission
of thy sinnes, and blot
out the hand-vvryting▪ that
God hath agaynst thee. Therfore
mourne and lament a little
in this world, least heereafter
thou mourne and lament
without end: humble thy selfe
a little here, least hereafter thou

beest cast dovvne into vtter
darknes, and into the euerlasting
flames of hell. Blessed is
hee that vvatcheth and laboureth
in this world, that he may
be found worthy in the day of
iudgment, of the society & fellowship
of the iust. But wretched
and miserable is hee, that
through his ovvne fault and
negligence depriueth himselfe
of this glory. For then shall
God in the cloudes take the
righteous, and shall carry them
with him into euerlasting ioy.
But sinners shall bee haled of
deuills in to euer-during and
euer-burning fire. VVho
vvill gyue riuers of vvater to
my head, and fountaynes of
teares flovving night and day
from mine eyes, that I may
vveepe for my sinnes, and
bevvayle my selfe, and that I
may entreate my Sauiour,

that hee would vouchsafe mee
his grace, that I may not bee
found vnworthy, when he shal
come to iudgement; least I
heare that fearefull and dreadful
sentence; Depart from mee
yee cursed into euerlasting fire: I
know yee not: But that I may be
worthy to heare that happy &
most sweete voyce; Come yee
blessed of my Father; inherite yee
the kingdome prepared for you?
To the which my Lord Iesus
Christ bring me, through the
merrits of his most sacred passion.
Amen.

The first is, your tender care, &

I shall continue my Thankfulnes

your Ladiship a long, peaceable,
and quiet life vpon earth, replenished
with affluence of the best
thinges, especially of that one
thing, that our Sauiour in the 10
of Luke told Martha was needfull;
Luke, 10. that you may instruct my
Mary to choose the good part,
which shal not be taken away from
her: that you with al the elect of
God, may be pertaker of that euerlasting

                  AN EXPOsition
vppon the
one and fiftie
Psalme. Haue mercy vpon me ô God.
                  
                  O Lord,Diuers names of God. thou that art the
Creatour and Maker
of all this words frame,
and al things are thine,
and the worke of thine hands;
yet neuerthelesse thou wouldest
onely bee called the God
of Abraham, Isaack, and Iacob,
of whom thy chosen people
Israell were to spring, although
most ingratefull: In
fauour of vvhom thou didst

shevve thy povver, and didst
worke greate and meruailous
thinges, as well in subduing
and subuerting theyr enemies,
which victories were full of all
admiration, as in staying the
course of the Sunne, and subiecting
the raging Sea; relentlesse
stones, and mightie ryuers
to theyr obedience, vvho warred
vnder thy banners; wherevpon
thou also art called a valiant
and strong GOD, the
God of armyes, and the Lord
of hostes. But vvhen this people
grewe rebellious and of a
stiffe necke, then also thou
didst shewe thy selfe terrible
and fierce, and didst gouerne
them with an yron rodde, with
feare and trembling: and those
that wold not be ruled by loue
& gentlenes, & by faire means
would not walke in theyr duties,
thou didst punish by most

swifte and horrible plagues,
& didst raigne vengeance vppon
them, that durst presume
to offende thy Maiestie; so
that thou didst beginne to bee
also called a GOD of vengeance:
so that at the hearing
of thy name not onely men,
but also the Sea and the elements
trembled.
                  And so long as thy fury was
not pacified by thy onelie begotten
Sonne, the gates of heauen
were so shutte vp, that
the iustest man aliue might
not passe thorough them.
Neyther durst sinners, considering
theyr vnwoorthynesse,
and theyr greeuous sinnes, and
seeing no other gates open
in all thys vvorlde, besides
those of iustice and vengeance,
venter to come neere thee:
for by custome they had learned
that comming vnto thee

for remedy, they found damnation:
approching for saluation,
they tasted death; because
thou wast called a consuming
fire.
                  Many ô Lord beeing daunted
with this feare, did wander
vp and downe sinking vnder
the burthen of desperation, hauing
no hope to find any mercie.
Others beeing seperated
from thee by ignorance, did
goe astray as sheepe without a
sheepeheard, bleating vp and
downe in this world. Therefore
sayd Dauid; Say vnto my
soule I am thy saluation; as if he
should say: My eares are ful of
terrible names and feareful tytles,
let the time come, in which
by a new name thou thy selfe
mayst promise saluation to my
soule. And this shal be, when
thou shalt be called Iesus, that
is, a Sauior. This in tymes past

sayde Dauid in the person of
all men.
                  But after that thou didst remember
thy mercie, and the
promises made vnto the Fathers,
that is, that the tyme
should come, that thou thy
selfe wouldest put on our humanity
and misery, when I say,
thou wentest out of the hal of
thy power and iustice, & comming
vnto vs didst enter into
the Pallace of thy mercy and
benignity, thou didst aboundantly
fulfil to all, whatsoeuer
thou hadst promised to anie.
But that greate follovver and
Apostle of thy Sonne Iesus
Christ our Lorde,2, Cor. 1. first began
to call thee the Father of mercy,
and the GOD of all consolation.
                  A Father, that hee might
signifie, that lyke a Father thou
wouldest helpe vs: A God,

because thou canst help whom
thou pleasest.
                  So that sinners seeing thee
to haue gone out of the hall
of thy seueritie, and to haue
come into the Pallace of thy
mercies and consolations, seeing
thee cloathed on euery side
with theyr vestiments, & made
one of theyr housholde; they
vvould no more vvander and
vage vp and downe, but beeing
vnited to thy most holie
Church, they come to thy
throane with sincere faith, and
firme hope, desiring remission
of their sinnes.
                  Thou hast done ô Lorde, as
hunters vse to doe, who that
they may not feare the vvilde
beast, doe cloathe themselues
after the colour of the mountayne:
so also thou tookest vppon
thee an earthen vesture,
like vs, that thou mightest take

whom thou wouldest. For as
thou didst show thine omnipotencie
in times past, by power
and reuengement: so thou
now wouldest shew thy mercy
by pardoning and forgyuing.
For to remitte an offered iniurie,
is no lesser glory, then to reuenge
it, yea it is greater glory
to forgiue it. Therefore there
is not, neyther can there bee a
sinne so great, which thou doest
not forgiue to him that is
penitent.
                  If a sinner had beene so vnhappy,
that considering the
greatnes of his sins, he had not
seene thy power and goodnes,
he had dispaired of pardon, &
had sayde that, which in times
past our first brother Cain said,
and after him Iudas, that is, My
sin is greater then can be pardoned,
and had layd violent hands
vpon himselfe.
                  
                     Therefore let him nowe reioyce,
and lyft vp his eyes to
heauen, whence commeth ayd
and helpe to all them, that are
found in the tribulations and
miseries of this world. Let him
open the eyes of his soule by
fayth, & let him behold round
about him ensignes and banners
displayed; not banners of
warre, of vengeance, or of iustice:
but of pitty, of mercie,
of pardon, of friendship, and of
reconciliation to all them, that
desire it in truth. Let him behold
those honoured and graced
in this Pallace, who were
wont to be his aduersaries and
enemies.
                  There he shall see that great
and famous sinner Magdalen
receaued into fauour. There
hee shall see those humbled,
and brought low, who supposed
themselues wise and holie

men; and them exalted, who
confessed themselues sinners,
and of no merrit. There hee
shall see that sinner S. Peter,
who was a periured denier of
his Maister, to bee made a piller
of the Church. There hee
shall see Saint Paule, that wolfe
and persecuter of the flock, to
be made a vessell of election.
                  Therfore let all sinners com,
let thē come I say to thys pallace
of mercie; and let them
constantly and assuredly beleeue,
that no man in the world
dooth heereafter so sinne, or
can sinne, that hee cannot or
may not obtaine remission at
Gods handes for all his misdeedes:
neyther that any enmities,
or quarrels can arise to
that height and passe, vvhich
can vtterly shutte vp the gates
of frindship and reconciliation.
                  
                     Wherefore, I feeling my selfe
burdened with the weight of
my sinnes, & swallowed vp in
the gulfe of misery, & desiring
especially the sight of the eyes
of my soule, which errors and
foule enormous sinnes haue
shut vp and blinded, and with
greater desire and thyrst desiring
& thirsting for thy grace,
and fauour, then the Hart or
the Hunter dooth the vvater
brookes, I come to the throne
of thy grace, entreating & beseeching
thee ô Lord, with that
humility, vvhich the greatest
sinner can come withal, knowing
his vnvvorthines, and his
enormities done and committed
before his eyes, vvho once
gaue him both being and life,
and after hee had lost it by sin,
and returned againe by repentance,
eftsoones restored it: before
his Maiestie, who with his

onely VVorde, that is, with his
VVisedome, created & made
all thinges of nothing: before
him, in whose power it is, not
only to create a thousand other
vvorlds, but also to doe those
things, which can neyther enter
into the thought of Angel,
or any other creature. Before
him, I say, I come, and say,
                  
                     Haue mercy vpon me, ô Lord.
And because, ô my Lorde, I
haue no merrits, by vvhich I
may boldly presume to come
vnto thee, (for I am not onelie
vnwoorthy of this thy great
mercy, but haue also iustly deserued
damnation & destruction
in hell) I desire this.
                  
                     According to thy great goodnes.
According to which, if we wel
consider, howe thou hast alwaies
vsed it towards sinners,

I beleeue, and am verily perswaded,
that thou art more easie
to be intreated, and readier
to forgiue, then I through my
weakenesse and infirmitie am
prone vnto sin. And because
my sinnes haue so increased, &
risen to that height, that they
are come into the presence of
thy diuine Maiestie, behold it
was in my power to fall, and
through mine owne fault haue
I gone astray: but to rise againe,
and come home is not
in my power, except thou succourest
and releeuest mee with
thy singuler & especial grace:
therfore I humblie desire thee
to haue mercie on me,
According to the multitude
of thy mercies.
Thee I say, I most humbly do
beseeche, vvho hast beene so
pittifull and mercifull towards

sinners, that of vncleane & filthy
wretches, thou hast made
them holy and righteous men,
that with the fire of thy loue,
which (as the Prophet sayth)
thou thy selfe art, calling thee
a fire, which dooth consume,
thou wouldest purge, burne
vp, and vtterly consume, all
mine iniquities and imperfections:
making mee of a stonecold
sinner, a most ardent louer,
and feruent follower of
thee, and of thy precepts and
commaundements. Neyther
only purge me from my sinnes
past, but
Wash mee throughly from my
wickednesse: and cleanse mee
from my sinne.
Wash mee so, ô Lorde, and so
cleanse all mine inward parts,
that there may not any thing
remaine in mee, that may solicite

mee to sinne againe. Giue
me strength and fortitude, to
ouercome the world, the deuil,
and the flesh, least I returne to
mine olde wayes & former errors.
And because I knowe, ô
Lord, that no man doth lyue,
that of himselfe can be iustified
in thy sight and presence: and
that thou doost onely vvill
this, that hee that desireth to
haue forgiuenes of his sinnes,
do acknowledge and confesse
himselfe a sinner, and that hee
lament and bewayle his misdeedes;
I being such a one, doe
say:
For I acknowledge my faults:
and my sin is euer before mee.
I doe acknowledge, I say, my
faultes, and confesse them not
onely outwardly, but also inwardly.
For although there are
some, that beeing spotted and

polluted with vaine hipocrisie,
and with some other vice doe
deceiue men vnder a shadowe
of pietie, yet Lord no man lyuing
can possibly deceiue thee
with a show of outward sanctitie,
if inwardly he be not so indeed.
                  I haue learned by experience,
that the inwarde sinne is
opposite and contrary to euery
one, which accuseth vvithout
intermission, and gnaweth the
conscience like a worme: by
the gnawing of which, that
horrible voyce of the damned
ariseth,Wised, 5, who say: We haue wearied
our selues in the way of wickednesse
and destruction, and wee
haue gone through dangerous
wayes: but wee haue not knowne
the way of the Lord.
                  
                  The Heathen in tymes past,
dyd confesse theyr errors and
offences to Mars, Venus, Iupiter,

Mercurie, and to other
vaine Gods, & fictions of Poets:
and many at thys day do
offend, because they haue riches,
honours, and the glorie
of thys world, & doe confesse
that they haue offended against
all these, because they haue erred,
& by the meanes of them,
haue not attained vnto theyr
desires. But I ô lorde doe contemne
all these, & do confesse
my sinnes vnto thee, because
Against thee onely haue I sinned,
& done euill in thy sight.
For all my sinnes are against
thee, as against the Lord, the
maker, and preseruer of all
thinges, from whom they cannot
be hid, but are open to the
eyes of thy diuinitie, as all other
thinges are, whether they
bee in heauen, in earth, or in
the depth of the Sea. And

truely my sinnes & transgressions
bee so many and so great,
that some beeing in the same
state of damnation with mee,
and not considering of thine
omnipotencie, but measuring
thee according to their ovvne
frailety and weakenes, haue in
theyr peruerse cogitations, descended
into iudgemēt against
thee, saying; My sins are greater
then can bee forgiuen. And
giuing no credite to thy words
& promises, suppose that thou
art angry and cruell, and doost
thinke vpon punishment and
vengeance, and not vpon pardon
and forgiuenes. And such
when they shall see, that thou,
ô my Lord, doost forgiue mee
my sinnes, will bee of another
minde, and be confounded in
theyr iudgements, & shal confesse
that which thou spakest
by thy Prophet,Esay, 55, saying; As

the heauens are higher then the
earth, so are my wayes higher thē
your wayes, and my thoughts aboue
your thoughts. Therefore
haue mercy vpon me, ô Lord,
and blot out mine offences;
That thou mayst bee iustified
in thy sayings: and cleare whē
thou art iudged.
But if a greater acknowledgement
of them be necessary for
the remission of my sins, or if
it carry any show of excuse to
repeate them frō the first beginning
and originall, I say, ô
lord, and plainly confesse, that
I was shapen in wickednes, and
in sinne hath my Mother conceiued
mee.
And that through that olde
transgression of our Father Adam,
which hee hath traduced
and conueyed to all his posteritie,

which hath made vs subiect
first to bodilie death, and
thē to spiritual: to both which
deaths we had still beene subiect,
vnlesse the seconde heauenly
Adam, Christ our Lord
and thy beloued sonne, had
freed and deliuered vs from
them by his most precious
blood, and had instructed vs
by his doctrine and examples,
and had showed vnto vs the
true way, by which wee might
againe returne to that first estate
of innocencie, in which
we were created in the garden
of Parradice.Gene, 3▪
                     
                     For thou louest truth in the
inward affections, and shalt
make mee to vnderstand wisedom
in the secret of mine hart.
For seeing that thou art that
ineffable & vnspeakable truth,
which thou louest, and which

is acceptable to all thine: by
obseruing it according to thine
owne promises, thou gauest
him who is the desired of Nations,
and promised in thy law,
that is, thy selfe, that we being
deliuered frō the feare of our
enemies, might serue thee, not
with that olde seruile loue,
which was for feare of punishment
and vengeance: but
vvith a filiall loue, as a Lorde
and Father, who neuer ceaseth
to showre downe his benefites
vpon vs his children. VVhich
loue and name of children we
haue obtained by Iesus Christ,
thy Sonne our lord: for by the
vertue of his merrits, & because
hee would bee our brother in
this worlde, hee hath giuen vs
boldnesse, that wee dare vvith
confidence call thee Father, &
thou also callest vs sonnes: not
naturall Sonnes: for Christ

alone is thy onely begotten
and naturall Sonne, and of one
substance with thee; but vvee
are adopted sonnes, by vvhich
adoption, if wee doe our duties,
wee come to the inhearitance
of thy kingdome vvith
him, therefore to vs being such
Thou hast manifested the sescrete
and hidden things of thy
wisedome.
That is, the misteries of our
redemption, which neither Socrates,
nor Aristotle, nor Plato,
nor any other of the Grecian
or Romaine Phylosophers,
could euer find out by all their
immeasurable study and long
searching: yea thou hast shewed,
that al those things, in which
they placed the last end and
chiefest felicitie, to bee meere
foolishnes, & extreame vanity;
and that which they supposed

foolishnes, thou hast showen
to be true wisedome, that thou
mightest declare, & manifest,
howe little mans strength can
preuaile without thy help, and
that thou mightest giue an example,
that none heereafter
shoulde trust to his owne vvit
or power: but thou dost giue
ioy and strength to them, that
with humilitie offer vnto thee
theyr misery and weakenesse:
and him thou fillest with thy
wisedome, that with a sincere
minde offereth vnto thee his
ignorance: and to bee briefe,
him thou iustifiest, that yeeldeth
vp himselfe vnto thee
humbled as a sinner. VVhich
seeing it is so, I desire thee, O
Lord,
That thou wouldest purge me
with hysope, & I shalbe clean:
that thou wouldest wash mee,

and I shall bee whither then
snow.
VVash mee, ô Lorde with the
water of that fountaine, which
floweth to eternall life, vvhich
thou didst promise to the vvoman
of Samaria, and purge me
with the hysope of thy grace:
and with the fire of thy loue &
charitie, burne away all the errors
of my frailetie, and all my
wickednesse, and then I shall
bee cleansed frō all my sinnes:
then I shall returne vnto the
state of innocencie, then I shall
be more pure, and whiter then
the whitest snowe. Then
Thou shalt make mee heare
of ioy and gladnesse: that the
bones which thou hast broken
may reioyce.
Then all my sences, which hetherto
serued the worlde, the
flesh, and the deuill; that lay

drowned in pleasures & world
lie delights which are rather to
be called sorrowes, miseries, afflictions,
and confusions, shall
receiue of thee ioy, gladnesse
and rest: and they shall begin
to heare and tast, howe good
and sweete, ô lord, thy Spirite
is to them, that serue thee with
humilitie. I hauing tasted of
thy Spirit, my flesh and bones
which are nowe broken, because
they serued earthly and
vile thinges, shall returne with
gladnesse to the obedience of
thy Spirit: They shall taste of
the high misteries of thy
workes, & shall know a great
part of thy goodnesse & graciousnesse,
which both heeretofore
thou hast vsed, and stil
vsest daily to all the nations of
the world: wherefore they shall
persecute those thinges vvith a
deadly hate, vvhich they haue

passed thorow, and that which
heeretofore was sweet & pleasant
vnto them, now they shall
esteem it bitter: & that which
they refused as bitter, now they
shall desire it as most sweet, &
shall giue thee immortall
thanks, because thou hast deliuered
them out of the depth of
misery, in which they wallowed,
beeing deciued with a false
vizard of pleasure & gladnes:
& because now ô lord, throgh
thy gracious goodnesse I am
come to the knowledge & detestation
of my sinnes, beeing
the ready way to saluation, O
Lord I pray thee,
Turne thy face from my sins,
and put out all my misdeedes.
Turne thy diuine face, I say,
the beholding and contemplating
of which is eternall lyfe:
deale not with me after my deserts,

but looke vpon mee with
the eyes of thy mercy, and take
from mee all my wickednesse.
Purge me, ô lord, and cleanse
me, not only from sinnes past,
but from all those, that may
happen to mee heereafter.
Create in mee a cleane hart, ô
God, and renue a right spirite
within mee.
Take from me my stony hart,
which hetherto hath delighted
it selfe with the loue and contemplation
of abiect and vncleane
things, and therefore it
is vncleane and polluted, I pray
thee ô lord take this from mee,
and vouchsafe to create another
in me, cleane, pure, and
chast. Take from me the spirit
of pride, of vaine-glory, of couetousnes,
of luxury, and of
many other vices and slaueries,
which hath raigned in mee, &

renew within me a right, mild,
and humble spirit, vvhich may
thirst after all righteousnesse.
Thou knowest, ô lorde, that
we are earth, and a masse of iniquitie,
and that vnlesse thou
doost support vs with thine
hand, we cannot do any thing,
but that which is earthly, there-I
pray thee;
Cast mee not away from thy
presence, and take not thy holy
spirit from me.
But alwayes direct mee & preserue
mee with thy right hand,
that I may say as the Prophet
sayd in times past; The Lord is
my Sheepheard,Psalm, 23, I shall not want.
Take not from mee thy holie
Spirit, the true comforter of
the afflicted who is the way of
truth to all them, that as wanderers,
lost, and desolate, doe
enter into the blinde Laborinth

of thys worlde, yea rather
Lord
Restore to mee the ioy of thy
saluation, and stablish me with
thy free spirit.
Giue mee grace, that by meditating
on those things, vvhich
thou hast wrought for our
saluation, and workest daily, &
in beholding thy will, who desirest
not the death of a sinner,
but that hee may be conuerted
and liue, I may enioy that true
ioy, and rest, which they enioy,
who beeing guiltie of eternall
death, doe heare that theyr sins
are forgiuen them; not of thē,
that haue no power to doe it,
but of him that is omnipotent,
who can neyther deceiue nor
be deceiued: who as hee cannot
die, so hee cannot fayle in
his promise.
                  Take from me ô lorde, the

spirit of bondage, which I haue
hetherto obeyed, and strengthen
me in thy loue and grace,
with thy royall and free spirit,
not subiect to the worlde, the
flesh, or the deuill, that we may
serue thee with ioy, in the perfection
of the works of righteousnes,
in the libertie of the
Gospell, to the which vvee are
restored by thy Sonne Christ
our lord and Sauiour.
                  And then, ô lorde, I beeing
strengthened by thy mercie, I
shall not onely be free, & clean
frō all sin: but I shal march into
the fielde as a couragious
warriour, & valiant captaine, &
I shall teach thy wayes vnto
the wicked, and sinners shal be
conuerted vnto thee.
Who seeing me to be made of
wicked iust, of weake mighty,
of a seruaunt free, of a subiect

thine adopted sonne, and considering
thys to be doone not
by mans strength, but by diuine
power, they will bee conuerted
vnto thee with all their
hart, and with all theyr soule.
But I pray thee, ô my lord, and
the GOD of my saluation,
whilst I am conuersant vvith
wicked, peruerse, and vngodly
men, doe not suffer me to sin
with them, or to pollute my
selfe with theyr blemishes. But
Deliuer mee from blood-giltinesse,
O God, thou that art the
God of my health: and my
tongue shall sing of thy righteousnesse.
As the sunne vvith his beames
dooth pierce and penetrate all
thinges,A Simily. both pure & impure,
and is not onely not polluted,
but also dooth purge those
things that are infected & corrupted:

so I beeing clothed
with the beames and heate of
thy charitie and loue, may with
out spotte and blemish be conuersant
among the impure &
vncleane. Thys if thou vvilt
grant mee, my tongue beeing
directed and guided by thy
grace and ayde, shall plant thy
righteousnes in their harts, and
they shall be deceiued, when
they shall thinke that it is my
worke, seeing that it is thine.
For of my selfe I am not sufficient
to doe it, nay I am not able
to speake a worde without
thy helpe & grace. That therfore
they may acknowledge
this, and yeelde thee thy due
prayse, and not bestowe it on
mee,
Open thou my lippes, ô Lorde,
and my mouth shall shew forth
thy prayse.
                     
And now ô lorde, I offer thee
my spirit afflicted & troubled,
because I haue offended thee,
to which I add a purpose of amendement.
Which sacrifice
I know doth please thee, & to
be that, which thou requirest.
For thou desirest no sacrifice,
though I woulde giue it, thou
delightest not in burnt offerings.
For now is the time, in which
no burnt offerings nor ceremoniall
sacrifices doe please
thee, or shall at any time hereafter
content thee: for thou
art a Spirit, and wilt bee vvorshipped
in Spirit. And therefore
The sacrifice of God is a troubled
spirit: a broken and contrite
hart (ô God) shalt thou
not despise.
                     
And because I knovve that no
man in this vvorlde, so long
as he liueth, doth come too late
to desire mercy and fauour at
thy hands: but that he shall alwayes
finde thee ready to giue
it vnto vs, therefore I desire
thee againe;
O be fauourable and gracious
vnto Sion: build thou the wals
of Ierusalem.
Deale with mee ô Lord graciously
& mercifully, according
vnto thy good will and pleasure,
and giue mee grace, that
the decayed and ruinous walls
of my soule, which are able to
hold out no force of the enemy,
may againe bee inwardly
reedified, that I may offer vnto
thee the true works of inward
righteousnes, which presently
shall follow the outward, being
signes of the inward. From

whence afterwards as from a
liuely fountayne, shall flow the
edifying of my neighbour, frō
which duplicity of works shall
arise a sweete harmony, acceptable
vnto thy diuine Maiesty,
and a sacrifice ioyned to that,
with which thou thy self saidst,
that thou art well pleased;
For then shalt thou accept the
sacrifices of righteousnes, euen
the burnt offering and oblation:
then shall they offer calues
vpon thine Altar.
All these things, I say, ô Lorde
shall they offer vpon thine Alter
as a new sacrifice, of which
the Prophet spake; This shall
please the Lorde better then a
young bullocke,Psal 69. that hath hornes
and hoofes, that is, the humanity
of Christ our Redeemer thy
Sonne, and his sacrifice; by
whose merrits our workes before

vnworthy, & of no value,
are made gratefull and acceptable
in thy sight.
                  After this manner therefore
ô Lord, both I, and others with
mee, who haue beene sinners,
lyuing now in thy worship and
seruice, will say:
Glory be to the Father, and to
the Sonne, and to the holie
Ghost: As it was in the beginning,
&c.
VVe will prayse and glorifie
thee alwaies both in this world,
and in the other, as the Father,
Creator & maker of all things;
and thy Sonne, the Deuine
Wisedome, as him, by whom
we alone are worthy to be called,
and to be in deed thy Sons;
and the holy Ghost, as the
Doctour & Teacher of grace,
the Comforter, Patrone, and
Leader to all good purposes.

VVho in the distinction of
persons, in a perfect Trinity, in
the vnity of substance, and in
Maiesty doe liue and raigne,
without beginning, vvithout
end, for euer and euer, world
without end. Amen.
                  
               
               
                  
                  A most deuout Prayer
of the name of
Iesus.
                  O Good Iesus, ô sweete
Iesus, ô Iesus the Son
of the virgin Mary, full
of pitty and mercy. O
sweete Iesus haue mercy vpon
me, according to thine infinite
goodnes. O bountiful Iesus,
I an vnwoorthie sinner doe
pray thee, by that thy precious
blood, which thou dist shed
vpon the Crosse, for sinners &
vngodly men, that thou wouldest
wash me from all my sins,
& that thou wouldest not despise
thy seruant, who humbly
prayeth, and calleth vpon this
most holy name of Iesus. This
thy name Iesus is a sweet name,
yea it is sweeter then any Nectar
or Ambrosia; this thy name
Iesus is a sauing name. For

what is Iesus, but a Sauiour?
Therefore ô good Iesus, who
of thy goodnes hast created
mee, and vvith thy precious
blood hast redeemed mee, doe
not suffer my soule to be haled
downe to hell, by reason of my
many and great transgressions.
Let not mine iniquities, ô good
Iesus, condemne my soule, created
of thine infinite goodnes.
Acknowledge in mee, ô good
Iesus, and chalenge, vvhat is
thine; that is, my soule: and
take from mee that which is anothers,
that is, all my sins and
enormities. O good Iesus haue
mercy vpon mee, as long as I
am in this world, least I be condemned
in that fearefull day of
iudgement. O good Iesus, if
I a peruerse sinner shal deserue
according to thy iustice to bee
damned, by reason of my greeuous
and enormous sinnes, I

humbly appeale from thy seuere
iustice, to thy gracious &
pittifull mercy: assuredlie trusting,
that thou my Lord Iesus
wilt be gracious and mercifull
to my soule, as a gracious Father,
and a mercifull GOD.
VVhat profit, ô good Iesus,
will there be in my flesh, if my
soule goe downe to hell?
                  For it is certaine ô Lord, that
no man in hel, shal yeeld praise
to thy holy name Iesus. O
most mercifull Iesus, bee mercifull
to vs. O most sweet Iesus,
deliuer vs from all our tribulations
and anguishes. O
good Iesus, be gentle and kind
to vs wretched sinners. O most
holy Iesus, associate our soules
with thine elect in heauen. O
most pittifull Iesus, the saluation
of all them, that hope in
thee, comfort vs. O Iesus the
Sonne of the most holy virgin

Mary, bestow on vs thy mercy,
grace, wisedome, charity,
chastitie, humilitie, and patience
in all our aduersities and
extreamities, that wee may alwayes
blesse, glorifie, honour,
and prayse Iesus. Amen.
