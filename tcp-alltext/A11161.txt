And it happed on a tyme that he weeſſhe the fret of a poure man whiche was a meſele / and ful of botches of whom he had grete abomynacion. bnt anon as he felt hym ſelf ſo abhorred he drāk a grete draght of that fonl water of whiche he had weſſhed the fret of the poure man ayenſt hys herte. but he felte it ſwete aboue alle other drinkes and oygnementes / this was a grete ſygne that alle hys ſynnes were pardoned and forgyuen by that werke of mercy / ¶ Example / It is redde of a noble lady that loued moche the lepres and meſeles / And dyde to them moche good. her huſbond was a knyght & a riche

man. and abhorred them and myght not ſee them: It happed on a day he was not at home. & a lepre come to the yate of thys noble lady And anon ſhe demaunded hym yf he wold ete or drynke. he anſwered that he myght not. but prayed her that ſhe wold brynge hym in to her lordes chambre. for to lye and reſte hym on hys bedde.

Seynt Jherome ſaith. that he remembreth not to haue ſeen a perſone to deye of an euyll deth. that gladly dyde the werkes of merry. The werkes of mercy doon many good thynges to them that doon them. they taken a way the ſynnes of hym that is truly confeſſyd and repentaunt. and in lyke wyſe as the water quenchyth the fyre. right ſo almeſſe quenchyth the ſynne of a perſone.

For nature enſeygneth it & god comaūdeth it. The maiſtres naturiens ſayen that the ſtork noureſſhith his fader and moder whan they be olde & may not helpe them ſelf. Thenne nature techeth what ought to be doon. to fader and moder / and yf one doeth not he doth ayenſt nature and ſynneth ayenſt the comandement of god And therfore it is wel reaſon that he or ſhe meſchieue that miſdoeth to fader and moder lyke as oftymes happeth.

For who that ſwereth without reaſon the name of our lord he periureth hym ſelf faſſly wetyngely. and ſynneth dedely: that is to ſaye whan one ſwereth knowyng. aduyſedly. and by deliberacion. who that ſwereth truly to his wetyng and for nought nothyng malicyouſly / but lyghtly and without blaſphemye he ſynneth venyally: and cuſtome is perillous and may wel torne to dedely ſynne.

And therfore ben they called Simonyaks. they that ſelle or bye the goods ſpirituell: and it is emonge alle the dedely ſynnes the gretteſt. For ſpyritualte is gretter than temporalite. They be ſymonyakes that for yeftes or for promeſſes or for praiers or for carnalite doo ſo moche that they or other ben. helpers to dygnytees of holy chirche. as ben biſſhops. abbotes / or other dignitees whiche ſhold be made by election. Example It is redde of an abbot 
                  Exā 
                that whan he deyed he praied and coūſeilled hys monkes that they ſhold make hys neuew abbot after him and ſo they dide It happed on a time that this abbot wente in diſportyng him allone by a fontayne that was in his gardin ¶ And he herd a wys that complained him ſorowful in grete complayntes / 

Thabbot coniured him to telle him what he was & he ſaid that it was the ſoule of thyn vncle that late was abbot & was in the foūtayne merueilleuſly tormented and brent / by cauſe of the carnal affeccion aud loue that he had to the. by cauſe he had prayed the monkes that they ſhold make the abbot after hym. ¶ Thabbot anſuerd to hym how may it be. that ye ſuffre ſuche brennyng in this fontaine whiche is ſoo attemperat The wys prayed hym to take a canſtyk of coper whiche ſtode behynd the aulter. and caſte it in to the fontayne / And he ſhold ſee how hoot it was. be wente and brought it & threw it in: and anon hit was molten as wax that is in the fyre / or butter in boyllyng water / whā thabbot had ſeen this anon he renounced his abbotſhyp vnto the abbaye / and neuer after was the wys herd Item it is ſymonye whan for yeftes or for prayers or for ſeruice ben gyuen the prebendes / the cures and the other benefyces of holy chyrche Example. It is redde in the

                book of peter de clugny / that an holy man was proſtrate in his prayers on the good friday. whiche was rauiſſhed in ſpyrite vnto Eſter day. and whan he was comen agayn to hymſelf he ſaid that he had ſeen in purgatorye a man deteyned and kept. by cauſe he had taken: xv poūd / oſ a clerke whyche was of the yefte of hys patrymonye.

Of thys ſynne be not quyt that by bargayn maad make leue or change theyr benefices / ne they that ſayen one vnto the other. I ſhal doo my beſt. & as moche as I may to my power that thou ſhalt haue my benefyce And thou ſhalt in lyke wiſe that I ſhal haue thyn for the lawe canon ſaith. beware ſaith it that ther be noo promeſſe ne couenaunt made.
