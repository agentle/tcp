                  To the Right Worshipfull Sir Thomas Gerard Knight.
                  
                     SIR, it is not long, ſince it firſt pleaſed you to grace mee with your acquaintance. Yet in ſo littell time, I haue obſerued great arguments, of your more then moſt ſingular loue, to this neuer ſufficiently beloued and admired faculty of Muſick: as namely, the perfit pleaſure and contentment you ſeeme to take therein; Your indefatigable aſsiduitie in the priuate exerciſe thereof, which hath gayned you ſuch a perfection that way, as is rare in a Gentelman of your ranck:
                  And laſtly your courteous and amiable deportment toward my poore ſelfe, and others, ſuch as my ſelfe; the ſonnes of Muſick, when by chance you light among vs. Vnworthie were I then of that thriſe worthie Mother, vnworthie to be phraſed a ſonne of Muſick, ſhould I not hartely affect and honour you, in ſuch ſort as I doe, whom I find ſo intirely to loue and honour hir. And hence it is, euen of my loue which you haue well deſerued for loueing hir ſo well, that I haue ſingled you out among ſo many my worſhipfull good friends for the Patron of theſe my ſecond labours, & haue firſt preſented them vnto your name, that vnder your protection and countenance they might paſſe abroad into the world. May it pleaſe you therefore to entertaine them, comming from a good affection, with a fauourable acceptance▪ which I aſſure my ſelfe you
                        •
                      gentelneſſe will vouchſafe to doe; eſpecially ſince they come in ſo ſeaſonable a time, at the very entrance of a new yeere, when vſually all gifts are well taken, euen trifles at their hands whoſe abilitie will not reach to preſent matters of higher worth: And ſo I humbly take my leaue,
                  
                     from Ely houſe in Holborne.

                     SIR, it is not long, ſince it firſt pleaſed you to grace mee with your acquaintance. Yet in ſo littell time, I haue obſerued great arguments, of your more then moſt ſingular loue, to this neuer ſufficiently beloued and admired faculty of Muſick: as namely, the perfit pleaſure and contentment you ſeeme to take therein; Your indefatigable aſsiduitie in the priuate exerciſe thereof, which hath gayned you ſuch a perfection that way, as is rare in a Gentelman of your ranck:
                  And laſtly your courteous and amiable deportment toward my poore ſelfe, and others, ſuch as my ſelfe, the ſonnes of Muſick, when by chance you light among vs. Vnworthie were I then of that thriſe worthie Mother, vnworthie to be phraſed a ſonne of Muſick, ſhould I not hartely affect and honour you, in ſuch ſort as I doe, whom I find ſo intirely to loue and honour hir. And hence it is, euen of my loue which you haue well deſerued for loueing hir ſo well, that I haue ſingled you out, among ſo many my worſhipfull good friends for the Patron of theſe my ſecond labours, & haue firſt preſented them vnto your name, that vnder your protection and countenance they might paſſe abroad into the world. May it pleaſe you therefore to entertaine them, comming from a good affection, with a fauourable acceptance: which I aſſure my ſelfe your gentelneſſe will vouchſafe to doe; eſpecially ſince they come in ſo ſeaſonable a time, at the very entrance of a new yeere, when vſually all gifts are well taken, euen trifles at their hands whoſe abilitie will not
