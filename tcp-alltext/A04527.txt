               In the somer these do chiefly reygne, contynual and brenynge agews tertyan and quartayne feuers, vomyting, laxes, blernesse with vlcers in the mouthe and pryuy membres. A cold stifnesse chancīg the sixt day in any feuer doth take away all iudgmente.
               All feuers which do not intermite and geue ouer the thyrde day be perillouse, but if the paciente haue no fyte that day ther is no ieope

                  If in a contynuall agew the outward membres be very cold and the inwarde partes hote and drye, it is a token of death
               If in an agew pustules and paynes chaunce in the ioyntes, it is a signe that the pacient fedeth wel.
               In a contynuall Feuer, yf the lyppes, the eyes, the Nose or the mouthe be wrythen and out of fashyon, so that the pacient can not se nor here and therwith all hys bodye be weake, it is a sygne that death is at hand.
               A sodeyne laxe or dotage in a continuall feuer is deadly.
               An apostem which doth not breake at the fyrst iudginge daye in a Feuer, doth signifie the longe contynuance of the dysease.
               Uoluntary teares in agewes be laudable, but they whiche flowe agaynst the pacyentes wyll be to be fearyd.

               He that hath a convulsyon or discencion in ye synowes, and thervpō an agew, is sodeynly delyuered.
               A tertyan not endid in seuen fittes shall contynue longe.
               The yelowe iaundes comyng vpō hym that hath a Feuer before the seuenth day is perillouse.
               To be affrayde in his sleape, or to haue the cramp is euill.
               To be shorte brethyd in an agew is the sygne of a convulsyon.
               Soryful syghes in sharpe agewes be to be fearyd.
               They which haue the quartaine haue seldome convulsyons, and yf he which hath a convulsion fal to a



quartayne he shalbe deliuerid from his conuulsyon.
               If he whiche hath an agew swette in these dayes folowing it is verye good, the thrid, the .v.vii, ix.xi.xiiii.xvii.xxi▪xxvii, xxxi.xxxiiii. for ye swetes do iudge ye feuer, but if they be otherwyse, they declare longe contynuance of ye disease & great paynes.
