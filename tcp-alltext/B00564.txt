               ANd firſt for Foode. A cheape, freſh and laſting victuall, called by the name of Macaroni amongſt the Italians, and not vnlike (ſaue onely in ſonne) to the Cuſ
                     •
                  cus in Barbary, may be vpon reaſonable warning prouided in any ſufficient quantity, to ſerue either for change and variety of meat, or in the want of freſh victual. With this, the Author furniſhed Sir Francis Drake and Sir Iohn Hawkins, in their laſt voyage.
            2 Any broth or Colaſe, that will ſtand cleare and liquid, and not gellie or grow thicke when it is cold, may alſo be preſerued by this lire of Nature from all mouldineſſe, ſowreneſſe, or corruption, to any reaſonable period of time that ſhalbe deſired. A neceſſary ſecret for all ſicke and weake perſons at ſea, when no freſh meate can be had, to ſtrengthen or comfort them.
            3 Now for Beuerage: All the water, which to that purpoſe ſhall bee thought needefull to be caried to ſea, will bee warranted to laſt ſweete, good, and without any intention to putrefaction, for 2, 3, or 4 yeeres together. This is performed by a Philoſophicall fire, being of a ſympatheticall nature with all plants and Animals. In the ſpace of one moneth, the Author wil prepare ſo many Tunnes thereof, as ſhall be reaſonably required at his hands.
            4 By this meanes alſo both Wine, Perrie, Sider, Reere, Ale, and Vineger, may be ſafely kept at ſea, for any long voyage, without feare of growing dead, ſowre or muſtie.
            5 And, as for Medicine, if any Nobleman, Gentleman, or Merchant, ſhall by his Phyſition be aduiſed to cary any ſpeciall diſtilled waters, decoctions, or iuyces of any plant or any other liquid vegetable or animall body whatſoeuer with him in any long voyage, this Author will ſo prepare the ſame onely by fortifying it with his owne fire of kinde, that he may be aſſured of the laſting and durabilitie thereof, euen at his owne pleaſure.
            6 Here I may not omit the preparation of the iuice of Limons with this fire: 
                  •
               ecauſe it hath of late been found by that worthy Knight Sir Iames Lancaſter to be an aſſured remedy in the Scurby. And though their iuice will, by naturall working and fermenting, in the end ſo ſpiritualize it ſelfe, as that it will keepe and laſt either ſimply of it ſelfe, or by the help of a ſweete oliue oyle ſupernatant: yet this Author is not ignorant, that it hath loſt much of his firſt manifeſt nature, which it had whileſt it was conteined within his owne pulp and fruit: (as is euident in the like example of wine, after it hath wrought long, which differeth exceedingly both in taſte and nature from the grape out of which it was expreſſed) whereas being ſtrengthened with this philoſophicall fire, it retaineth ſtill both the naturall taſte, race, and verdure, that it had in the firſt expreſſion: and ſo likewiſe of the Orange.
            7 There is alſo a ſpecificall powder for Agues Quotidian, and Tertian

                and ſometimes it helpeth Quartans. Halfe a dramme is ſufficient for a man: and a quarter of a dramme for a child. It is taken in white Wine Beere, or Ale. It cureth ſometimes at the firſt taking, often at the ſecond, and ſeldome or neuer falleth at the third time. It is not offenſiue to the taſte. It expelleth the diſeaſe, without any euacuation or weakening of the Patient.
            8 A ſweete Paſte, for the head-ache: which commonly giueth eaſe, in one houres ſpace, either vpon the firſt or ſecond taking, becauſe it is ſpecificall. The doſe is the weight of

            9 A ſafe, general & gentle purging Powder, to be taken in white wine, working eaſily without any convulſion, or other offence to the ſtomacke. It is pleaſant, and hath not any common or knowen purgatiue therein. It weakeneth not the Patient, neither doeth the body grow coſtiue after it: which is vſuall in moſt of the common purgatiues. There haue been ſo many trials made vpon all ſorts of complexions with this powder, as that it may well deſerue the name of a generall purge: yet I can leaſt commend it in Cholericke bodies. The doſe is two drammes and an halfe at a time. This being taken in warme weather for three dayes together, in the Spring and Fall, will preuent both the Gowte and Dropſie, and moſt of thoſe diſeaſes that ſpring from rheumaticke cauſes: and if it cure them in eight or ten dayes, take it for aduantage. It cureth the Pockes newly taken in fiue or ſixe dayes: and in tenne or twelue dayes, at the moſt, it cureth a deepe rooted Pocke.
            10 And if the plague, burning

And, in the cure of any kind of poyſon, no Vnico

            11 There is alſo a medicine, which I will commend for the ſea (being a notable aſtringent powder) which ſtayeth any flux of blood in a ſhort time, and often cureth the Piles and Emerhoides.
            12 The Eſſences of ſpices and floures (as of Cinnamom, Cloues, Mace, Nutmegs, Roſemary, Sage, &c) being in the forme of powders, may with leſſe danger be caried at ſea, are more apt to be mixed and incorporated with Syrupes,

            Thus much I am bold to offer and publiſh for the benefit of ſeafaring men, who for the moſt part are deſtitute both of learned Phyſitions and skilfull Apothecaries: and therefore haue more neede then others to cary their owne defenſatiues and medicines about them. Which if it ſhall receiue enterteinement according to the worth thereof and my iuſt expectation, I may happily be encouraged to prie a little further into Natures Cabinet, and ſo to diſperſe ſome of her moſt ſecret Iewels, which ſhe hath long time ſo carefully kept, onely for the vſe of her deareſt children: otherwiſe, finding no ſpeedy or good acceptance of this my proffer (but rather croſſed by malice or incredulity) I doe here free and enlarge my ſelfe from raine owne fetters: purpoſing to content my ſpirits, with ſuch priuate and pleaſing practiſes, as may better ſort with my place and dignitie, and in likelyhood prooue alſo more profitable in the ende, then if I had thankeleſly deuoted my ſelfe to Bo
