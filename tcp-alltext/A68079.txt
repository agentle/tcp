            or frends to write vs moue.
            As for example when our frende
            in any foren land
            Farre diſtant is, and we deſire
            to let him vnderſtand
            Of this or that, of warres, of peace,
            of ſtrangie newes or elſe
            Of other things that nede requires:

            And ſhewes by louing letter how
            the mynde ſhal be diſcuſt,
            What order, and what Methode eke,
            therein obſerue we muſt.
            How to begin, how to procede,
            and how the finall ende▪
            
            Muſt ordred be in ech affaire,
            to foe, or elſe to frende.
            So that obſeruing of this worke
            in euery point throughout,
            A Letter, or Epiſtle well
            compoſe we ſhall no dout.

            as dayly proofe doth finde.
            
               
For why? by letter well we may
            communicate our heart
            Vnto our frende, though diſtance farre
            haue vs remou

            By Letter we may abſence make
            euen preſence for to be,
            And talke with him as face to face
            together we did ſee.
            By letter we may tell our ioy,
            by letter ſhew our griefe:
            By letter from our frende thereof,
            we may receiue reliefe.
            By letter what ſo heart can think,
            or what can head deuiſe,
            To frende, or foe, the ſame we may
            preſent before his eyes.
            Our ſtéedeat home in ſtable ſtandes,
            our purſe alſo we ſpare,
            When louing letter trots betwene,

            It blabbeth not abrode the hid
            and ſecrete of our mynde,
            To any one, ſaue vnto him
            to whome we haue aſſignde.
            And looke what ſo we charge it tell,
            it miſſeth not a iote:
            
               
When meſſenger by word of mouth
            might hap forget his note,
            And either tell ſomewhat to much,
            or elſe leaue ſome vntold:
            Therefore the littel Letter well
            to truſt we may be bolde.
            More might I proue in praiſe thereof,
            but ſure it ſmally néedeth:
            For very nede it ſelfe the profe,
            in euery brayne now bredeth.
            Therefore although perhaps this work
            be not ſo finely pend,
            As ſuch a matter might require,
            yet pardon do me lend.
            For know you ſure, I meane not I
            the cunning clerks to teach:
            But rather to the vnlearned ſort
            a few precepts to preach:
            A nedeleſſe thing of truth it were
            vnto the body ſound,
            To miniſter Phiſitions ayde,
            where no diſeaſe is founde.
            But if diſdaining tongues do ſaye,
            'tis proudly doon of thée,
            To take in hand ſo great a thing,
            thou ſhouldeſt haue let it bée:
            
               
That other ſome more learned hed,
            or man of yeres▪ more graue,
            Might haue depainted out the ſame
            with words both fine and braue.
            Ile ſay againe it's better that
            the body ſhould be fed
            With bread of Barley, than it ſhould
            for lack of foode be ded.
            So yet if Momus hap to mowe.
            or Zoylus chance to chide,
            (Whoſe churliſh checks eche painfull pen
            of force ſometime muſt byde)
            Then to your worſhips I appeale,
            for iuſt defence therin,
            Requeſting that your lawfull ayde,

            which neuer ceaſſe to clatter,
            In corners darke with depe deſpite,

From rude and ranck reproches all

            So ſhall you ſtill encorage me
            to practiſe further paynes,
            And pray for your proſperities,
            to him that rules and raignes
            In heauen aboue, where I do wiſh
            (when ye haue run this race
            Of mortall life) your worſhips all
            to haue a dwelling place.
            Your worſhips. W. F.

               Now ſay, if that I be in vayne.
            
            
               And if that eche degree me vſe:
               Then me but loue how can ye chuſe?

               ALthough (gentle Reader)
I knovve my ſelfe
both in vvit, learning,
and yeares, to be farre
inferiour vnto diuers
other: yet in good wil
perdy to profit my natiue
Cuntry, I giue place vnto none: which
vvill (together the ſlackneſſe I perceiue in
many learned and wiſe) hath pricked me
forwarde, though vnlearned, according to
that ſmall talent that God hath lent me, to
bring to light 
                  •
               uch bokes, as in my iudgement
are both profitable, and needeful for
this our preſent time. Amongſt vvhich I
heere offer vnto thine eyes this treatiſe, called
The Enimie of Idleneſse: vvhich I haue
ſo entitled, for that as vvell vvhen vrgent
affaires require, as alſo at vacant tymes
when leiſure permitteth the, (for the auoiding
of Idleneſſe, the capital enimie to all
exerciſe and vertue) thou mayeſt occupie
and practiſe thy ſelfe therin, taking pen

in hand, and gratifieng thy frende vvith
ſome conceite or other: vvhereby thou
shalt both purchaſe frendship, increaſe in
knovvledge and alſo driue avvay drovvſy
dumps and fond fanſies from thy heauy
head. Play not then the part of the folish
Nun: Rede not onely Omnia probate, But
alſo turne ouer the leafe and reade Quod
bonum eſt tenete. Peruſe ouer with indifferency
the vvhole worke, and if there thou
finde any thing fault worthy, either gently
correct the ſame thy ſelfe, or elſe frendly
giue me admonition of it, that I may amend
it: For he that can make a fault, may
perhaps alſo mend a fault. Alvvaies prouided
that thy iudgement be not to curious,
leſt (ſtepping forth vvith Appelles)
I ſay Ne ſutor vltra crepidam. So
doing thou shalt binde me to
further trauell, I truſt for
thy commoditie.
Farewell.

            ¶The firſt boke.
            
               Inſtructions how to
endyte Epiſtles and
Letters▪ &c.
               
                  THe auncient Poet
Lucanus doeth giue
vs a verie likely
cōiecture that the
inuention of Epiſtles
and Letters,
was firſt found forth in the Citie
of Memphis, ſaying thus: Conficitur
bibula Memphitis charta papyro. And to
deſcribe the true definition of an
Epiſtle or letter, it is nothing elſe
but an Oration written, conteining
the mynde of the Orator or
wryter, thereby to giue to vnderſtand
to him or them that be abſent,
the ſame that ſhould be declared
if they were preſēt, whereof

there be three principall ſortes,
for ſome are addreſſed to our ſuperiours,
as to Emperors, kings,
princes &c. Some to our equalles
as to Marchants, Burgeſſes, Citizens
&c. Some to our inferiors,
as to ſeruants, laborers, &c.
               Yf we ſpeake or write of or to
our ſuperiors, we muſt do it with
all honour, humilitie & reuerence,
vſing to their perſonages ſuperlatiue
and comparatiue termes:
as moſt high▪ moſt mighty, right
honorable, moſt redowted, moſt
loyall, moſt worthy, moſt renowmed,
altogether according to the
qualitie of their perſonages. And
it is to be noted that of ſuperlatiue,
comparatiue, poſitiue or
diminutiue termes, we muſt vſe
but three at once at the moſt.
               Note alſo that moſt commonly
in Epiſtles & Letters, there be

three neceſſary points. The firſt
is the ſalutation of recommendacion,
which is made in ſundrie
maners, according to the pleaſure
of the enditer, as may well be perceiued
by diuers ſtyles hereafter
folowing.
               The ſecond is the Subſcription,
which muſt be don according
to the eſtate of the writer, and the
qualitie of the perſon to whome
we write: For to our ſuperiors
we muſt write at the right ſyde in
the nether ende of the paper, ſaying:
By your moſt humble and
obedient ſonne, or ſeruant, &c. And
to our equalles we may write towards
the midſt of the paper ſaying:
By your faithfull frende for
euer. &c. To our inferiors we may
write on high at the left hand ſaying:
By yours &c.
               The third is the Superſcripcion,

which muſt be vpon the back ſyde,
the letter being cloſed, ſealed and
packed vp after the fineſt faſhion,
whereupon muſt be written his
name to whome the letters ſhold
be addreſſed, & his dwelling place,
(if it be not notoriouſly knowne)
placing therwith the name of his
dignitie, Lordſhip, Office, Nobilitie,
Science, or Parentage:
And if we write moe than one, the
chiefeſt and permanent dignities
muſt be written firſt, then the conſanguinitie:
and afterwarde the
mutable dignitie, as for example:
To my Lord of ſuch a place, my
couſin, Maiſter of the Requeſtes
of our ſoueraigne Lord the King.
Yf we write to our Superiour,
we muſt vſe all honour and reuerence
without embeſeling his
name, as to the King our Soueraigne
Lorde: To our reuerend

Father in God the Biſhop of &c.
To the high & mighty Lorde, my
Lord of, &c. To my Lord of, &c. Yf
we write to our equall, we muſt
place in the ſuperſcription hys
name, and the name of his dignitie
or office, furniſhed with an
honeſt and ſemely poſitiue or two
at the moſt, correſpondent to the
maners and dignities of the perſon,
as, to the ryght worſhipfull,
ſuch a one, Marchant & Citizen
of London: To hys moſt aſſured,
(or truſty friende) ſuche a
one, &c. Yf we write to oure inferiour,
we may vſe in our ſuperſcription:
To his louing ſonne,
ſuch a one, &c. To his truſty ſeruant,
ſuch a one, &c.
               It is to bee noted, that it becommeth
not an inferior perſon,
ſpeking or addreſſing his words
to his ſuperior, to ſpeke nor write

by the imperatiue, or commaunding,
as if one ſhould ſay thus:
Soueraigne King, behold a valiant
man, make him knight: Behold
ſuch a one, who is a good
Clerke, giue him a benefice: but
with all humilitie we muſt ſay:
worthy ſoueraigne, I aſſure your
maieſty that he is an expert man,
pleſeth it you to haue him in remembrance:
Such a one ſemeth
vnto me to be very learned and
ſkilful, it were a charitable deede
of your maieſtie to prouide for
him, and therefore I am bolde
to commit him to your remembrance.
               Yf we addreſſe our ſpeach to
our equall, we muſt ſpeake with
a certaine familiar reuerence, vſing
poſitiue and comparatiue
termes, and very fewe ſuperlatiue,

as wyſe, ſage, honorable,
worſhipfull, diſcrete, renowmed,
&c.
               Yf we ſpeake to our inferiour,
we muſt vſe a certayne
kynde of modeſt and ciuill authoritie,
in giuing them playnely
to vnderſtand our intent and
purpoſe. A Marchaunt hauing
many ſeruantes, to his chiefeſt
may ſpeake or wryte by thys
terme, you: but to them whome
he leſſe eſtemeth, and are more
ſubiect to correction, hee maye
vſe this terme, thou, or otherwiſe
at his diſcretion: Alſo a
Father to his ſonne may do the
like.
               If Epiſtles or Letters ſhold
be written by fonde, Lunatike,
or folkes wythout reaſon, to
ſuche maner of people it were

were but ſimplicitie to gyue inſtructions.
Yet notwithſtanding
bycauſe that thys place remayneth
vnfurniſhed, and for that
Stultorum infinitus est numerus. I will
declare ſomething of that which
I haue ſene and heard: For ſome
wryte thus, Patrick Spendal,
Prince of pouertie: to his Goſſip
Geffrey Graceleſſe, Doctor of
Dronckenſhip ſendeth greeting,
&c.
               Before that we take in hand
the material inſtruments wherewith
to write an epiſtle or letter,
we haue to conſider theſe pointes
following: to wit, the eſtate, dignitie,
or qualitie of hym vnto
whom we write: whyther he bee
a publike perſō, or a priuat, whyther
he be rich or poore, a friend or
an enemie: alſo whyther he bee
well known vnto vs, or but little.

There bee ſome of ſo ouerthwart
a nature, that they neuer take
pleſure to reade any thing that is
writen vnto them, be the matter
neuer ſo pleaſant and mery: vnto
ſuch it behoueth to write ſuccinctly
and briefly: But to them whom
we know do take pleſure to reade
letters, we ſhould, and may without
danger write amply, properly
and eloquently.
               When we write to the Spiritualtie,
we muſt reuerēce them,
& that by ryght: for ſuch perſons
are called of God to hygh dignities:
and if we requeſt any thyng
at their handes, we muſt humble
our ſelues, gyuing them that honour
and reuerēce which is iuſtly
due vnto them. Yet we muſt warily
take heede that we exalt them
not to much & more than reaſon
would permit, for ſo might we be

noted of flattery and adulation,
and they themſelues alſo might
therewithall iuſtly be offended:
therefore let vs take heede that
we write not impudently or vnaduiſedly.
               But if we write to our frend,
we may make our Epiſtle or letter,
long or ſhort, as we ſhall
thinck beſt, and as it ſhall be moſt
delectable: For a frende taketh
all things agreably and in good
part, and excuſeth euery thing
that he may reaſonably excuſe,
whereas the enimie cōtrariwiſe
quickly reprehendeth and argueth,
yea where there is no fault
nor offenſe. And therefore he
that writeth to his enimie, or to
a perſon of ſmall acquaintance,
or where he douteth will be ſmall
eſtimation made of his writing,

he muſt wittily, and firſt of all
declare that loue is iuſt or charitable
for ſome honeſt cauſe, without
vaūting himſelfe, or ſpeaking
arrogantly, as to ſay, I would
that you ſhould vnderſtand what
I am, &c. And then afterwarde
to be briefe and circumſpect.
               And aboue all things we muſt
take heede, that we write not of
higher matters, than our vnderſtanding
or knowledge may comprehend:
for thereby are fooles
knowne and manifeſted, euen as
they be that preſume to diſpute of
thinges that either they vnderſtand
not, or elſe haue very litle
knowledge in them.
               Alſo we muſt not write to
them that be ſimple and ignorant
by termes that be ſtraunge & vnknown,
for ſo ſhold they haue iuſt
occaſiō to ſuſpect that we deride

and mock them.
               And in fine, reteyne this for a
principall, that the fayreſt language
that may bee, is the common
and familiar ſpeache, and not that
of rare and diffuſed phraſes, or
inckhorne termes ſkummed from
the Latin, nor of to baſe termes &
barbarous, or termes vnknowne
except in certain places, for there
is nothing more decent, than to
keepe a meane in all things, and
nothing more ſure than to ſwim
betwene two Ryuers, Nam in medio
conſiſtit virtus. And as Horace
ſayth.
               
                  Eſt modus in rebus, ſunt certi deni
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      fines:
                  Quos vltrà, citrà
                        
                           
                        
                        que

                  A meane there is in matters all,
                  and certeyne bondes are pight:
                  On this ſyde or beyond the which,
                  nothing can ſtand thats right.
               
               Furthermore, it is to be conſidered,

whether the matter that
we write off bee honeſt, true, or
ſuch like: or whether it be ſlanderous,
doutfull, obſcure. &c. For if
the matter of yt ſelfe bee honeſt &
perfect, then needeth it but ſmall
perſwaſion: but if it bee doubtfull
or obſcure, it behoueth to make
large and euident declaracion: if
it be ſlanderous or vnhoneſt, then
muſt bee added thereunto agreable
remedies: as Terence doth, excuſing
diſſolute perſones, for he
ſayeth it is thorough negligence
of their parents or for pouertie, or
by flatterie. And ſo likewyſe he
that would defend a thief, may alleage
that it was done thorough
companie & ill counſel, or through
pouertie, or that he was diſtract
of his wittes. Whoſo will more
circumſpectly and narrowly entreat
of ſuche matters let them

reade the Rethorike of Maſter
Doctor Wilſō, or of Maſter Richard
Rainolde.
               Moreouer there be ſūdry other
ſortes of Epiſtles & Letters, for
ſome are theologicall or of Diuinitie,
as be the Epiſtles of Plato,
of Denys, & of thappoſtles S Paule,
S. Peter, S. Iames, and S. Iohn: other
ſome are of maners and vertues,
as thoſe of S. Auguſtine, S. Hierome,
S. Ambroſe, Seneca, Cyprian: and other
ſome are of great importance, as
of peace, warre, and gouernance:
other ſome of newes: other of
Recommendations: other of admonition:
other of loue, as be
thoſe of Ouid, and of Propertius:
other of domeſticall familiaritie:
and other ſome are pleaſant and
ioyfull. But in this litle volume
we will onely entreat of the moſt

vſuall, and of ſome diffuſedly,
and the ouerplus ſhal remaine to
the imaginatiō of gentle mindes,
who by the ſkill of their penne,
were able to repaire the whole
ruine of Rethorike, if there ſhold
happen any deſtruction or detryment.
               Euery Epiſtle is either of Doctrine,
of Myrth, or of Grauitie.
The Epiſtle of Doctrine is that
wherein are expreſſed all good
and euill things to them that be
abſent. That of Myrth is, which
by pleſaunt, long, and familiar
language, is made either to
comfort, to reioyce, or to get the
good wyll and beneuolence of
them whome we write vnto.
               And that of Grauitie is, when
the matter is morall or ciuill,
&c.
               
                  
And all theſe three ſortes doe
tend to their proper endes: For
whoſoeuer writeth of Doctrine,
ought to haue regarde to this end
& to profit and inſtruct them vnto
whome he writeth: he that writeth
of myrth muſt tend to recreation
and paſtime, vſing ioyfull &
merie language, pleſant ſpeache &
ieſtes: he that entreateth of grauitie
muſt haue reſpect to honor
and profit.
            
            
               Example of an Epiſtle
of Doctrine.
               THe Epiſtle of Doctrine may be
certaine, or doutfull in his ſubſtance:
certayne when we render
a cauſe, reaſon, aucthoritie, or opinion
of that which we write:
doutfull, when we leaue the matter
in ſuſpenſe or not fully condeſended
vpon, as if we ſhold write
thus: You haue written vnto me to

certifie you whether that ſorcerers do
vſe to ryde vpon a Byzom, and practiſe
ſuch other like trim trams. For anſwer:
Seing that of many ſuche like matters
there be diuers opinions, I leaue the
caſe euen as it is: For in this matter &
other of greater importance, wiſer men
than I do ſtand in dout, I will holde my
peace, and make you none other anſwer.
            
            
               Example of an Epiſtle
of Mirth.
               AN Epiſtle or Letter of mirth,
muſt be endited with pleſāt lā
                  guage,
as to ſay thus: For newes
in theſe quarters you ſhall vnderſtande
that one of oure neighbors is lately retorned
from Turkie, and hath tolde me
for a certainty that ye great Turke doeth
altogether wallow in worldly pleſures,
wherein he ſetteth his whole felicitie.
And amongſt other his paſtimes he deliteth
in Singing and Muſicians, whome
at the beginning of Winter he ſendeth
into a certaine cuntry ſo cold, that their
voyces and tunes aſſone as they are out

of their mouthes do incontinently remaine
altogether froſen vntil ſuch time
that the Winter be paſte: And then
when the Spryng tyme approcheth, this
great Turke accompanied wyth the
Ladies and Damſels of his Cuntrey,
cauſeth ſundry great feaſtes and bankets
to be made, remayning there til
the Sunne war warme. And then beginne
the voices and tunes of the yeare
paſt, to vnfryſe and thawe, reſounding
verie melodiouſly in the Ayre thoroughout
the whole Countrey, &c,
            
            
               Example of an Epiſtle
of Grauitie.
               AN epiſtle of Grauitie, as
is before ſayd, muſt bee of
Morall or Ciuill matter, tending
to honour: as to ſay thus.
Sir, ſeing that the publike weale is
to be preferred before particular profit,
how can we honeſtly refuſe this combat?
And if for the maynteining of

the faith of Ieſus Chriſte againſt the
Turke, we ought to ſpare neither bodie
nor goodes: what may be ſayde
of the refuſall, delay, or ſuttle reaſons,
but that we be cowardes, traytours,
wicked heretikes, and worthy
of perpetuall reproch? For my parte
I will rather quite abandone and put
all in daunger, than otherwiſe: The
which I alſo requeſt and counſell you
to doe, to the ende that we may gette
euerlaſting honour, &c.
            
            
               The Diuiſion of
an Epiſtle or
Letter.
               IT is to bee noted that euerie
Epiſtle conteineth three partes,
euen as an Argument doeth,
which conſiſteth of the Maior, the
Minor, and Concluſion, which the

Orators 
                     •
                  all the cauſe, the intent,
and the conſequence: The cauſe
is in place of the Maior, which moueth
or conſtrayneth vs to write
to an other, willing to ſignifie vnto
him our mynde: The intent is
in ſteade of the Minor, whereby
we gyue him to vnderſtand what
our mynde is by Epiſtle or letter.
The conſequent or concluſion is
of it ſelfe ſufficiently knowne.
            
            
               The firſt ſtyle or maner wherein
the Cauſe is ſpecified.
               SYr you haue written vnto me, and deſired
me that I would lend you, & ſend
you by your lacky, this bearer, one of my
bookes for youre recreacion and paſtime.
And bicauſe that I know the greate affection
and deſire of you, by your Epiſtle
ſo eloquently compoſed and endyted, I
therefore am conſtrained, and (by youre
letters full of humanitie) compelled to
make you aunſwer as one, who altogether
is determined to ſhew you pleaſure

to lend, and ſend you the booke that you
demaund: for in ſo doing I hope that
(In caſu ſimili vel maiori,) you will anſwere
me according to my deſire, which
may engendre betwene vs not onely a
mutual loue, but alſo a perpetuall beneuolence,
and a continuall good will.
               The three foreſayd partes
muſt be in euery Letter and Epiſtle,
either couertly or plainely.
And a man may alſo adde to other
neceſſary and ſuperabundāt
clauſes, euery thing in as briefe
order as may be, and according
as the cauſe requireth & importeth:
& it is not nedefull alwaies
to write the cauſe, but it is requiſit
to write the intent, & the conſequence
or cōcluſion, for the conſequence
dependeth of the two
firſt the which muſt be very much
either perſuading or diſſuading.
               He that can artificially and
workmanlike handle an Epiſtle,

may begin with the intent, afterwardes
tell the cauſe, & end with
the conſequence: or begin with
the conſequence, after declare the
intent, and then the cauſe, ordring
the whole matter as vnto himſelfe
ſhal ſeme beſt & moſt decent.
            
            
               The ſecond Style, wherein the Cauſe
is firſt, afterward the Intent,
and then the Concluſion.
               THe thing which God and Nature
would principally ſhould be deſyred
with moſt harty affection,The Cauſe. and the which
I perceiue to be imprinted in my ſelfe
more than any other thing, (my ſingular
and perfect frende,) is to know, to
learne, and to practiſe all honeſty and
humanitie.The Intent. And bicauſe that aboue all
Orators writing of humanitie, the ſentences
of Tully are preferred, and bycauſe
that he is eſtemed of all men the
Prince of eloquence, (yet notwithſtanding
partely vnknowne in theſe quarters,)
and notoriouſly manifeſted at Paris,
the Fountaine of Science, therefore

haue I thought good to write vnto
you,The Concluſion. as to him whom I accompt my ſingular
frende, requeſting you aboue all
the pleaſures that you deſire to do me:
and alſo that you hope (as I may imagine)
that it may be the cauſe to erect &
make me a man of vnderſtanding, that
it wold pleaſe you to ſend me the booke
of Tullie. And in ſending, I will not forget
the recompence of your humanitie,
which ſhall not be defrauded of me thorough
ingratitude, &c.
            
            
               The third Style in this order, the intent,
the Cauſe, and the
Concluſion.
               
                  I Would,The Inteut. dere frende, that you tooke as
great pleaſure to lende me the Paradoxes
of Cicero, as I deſire to haue them of
you, and throughly to peruſe them ouer
by cōtinual reading, but I haue always
deferred to demand them of you, bicauſe
they were nedeful for you in your ordinary
lectures.The Cauſe. Notwithſtanding for yt I am
now aduertiſed yt your lecture hath takē
end, to your great honor & good renown,

I ſuppoſe that the booke is out of your
ſeruice, together alſo as I vnderſtand, it
is more corrected than any other. For
this cauſe I requeſt you to ſend it me:The Concluſion. ye
which I hope you will eaſely performe.
And ſo doing I ſhall acknowledge the
good will which you beare vnto me, in
ſending me the booke which perchance
you loue beſt, & whereof it may be that
you haue moſt néede: And ſhalbe bound
to lend you what ſoeuer you ſhall demaund
me according to my poſſibilitie.
Promiſing moreouer bothe my ſe
                     •
                  e and
goods at your commaundement, &c.
            
            
               The fourth Style in this order, the
Concluſion, the Cauſe, and
the Intent.
               YOu ſhould do me a great and ſingular
pleaſure,Concluſion. yea and alſo ſhold binde
me for euer, if it wold pleaſe you to agrée
to my requeſt, the which is nothing
preiudiciall vnto you, and vnto me very
neceſſary and profitable:Cauſe. It is to lende
me your booke of Rhetorike, for many
times when I talke or declare a matter

to the ende to perſwade,or diſſwade or
otherwiſe, I perceiue my ſelfe ſo naked
and vnfurniſhed of termes and phraſes
for the purpoſe, and ſuch as I accuſtomably
vſe, I apply them ſo ill, that eueryone
is weary, and ceaſſeth to giue eare vnto
me, for the diſcorde of my ſpeach. But if
any do tary to heare the ende, they be either
poore ignorant women, or elſe ſuch
as deryde me, to my ſhame, confuſion, &
great diſhonour.Intention. Therefore I am conſtrained
humbly to require you, that it
would pleaſe you to lend me your booke
of Rethorike, for to haue thereof the copie,
to the end that I may auoid ſuch inconuenience,
which hapneth vnto me
through the fondneſſe and abuſe of my
language.
               Here is to be noted that the
concluſion is made but in three
ſortes onely: to wit by Amplificacion
and enlarging, by commiſeration
and pittie, or by Epiloge
and briefe reherſall.
               By Amplification, as inducing

laughter, or ioy: by commiſeracion,
as in mouing to pitty &
pardon: by Epiloge, as in collecting
briefly together that which
hath ben amply and at large declared
in the Epiſtle before,Why the Epiloge is made. eſpecially
when it conteyneth many &
long partes: And the Epiloge is
made to the ende the Readers or
the herers be not defrauded of the
purpoſe & concluſion. But this is
more decent & conuenient in Epiſtles,
than in Letters, for letters
ought to be briefe and ſhort.
               And yet bicauſe this place ſhall
not be left darkely & obſcurely, I
wil giue more ample intelligence
of commiſeracion, amplification,
Epiloge, & alſo of demonſtration.
               Cōmiſeracion muſt be made of
ſwete, pitiful, & humble lāguage,
like to a Cōmedie, & muſt be brief,
for it is ynough if a man do but

ſomwhat moue the Audience to
pittie: as to ſay thus with humble
modeſtie: wold to God, right
worſhipfull, that I had wept to
you, & not haue prouoked you to
wepe: for with great paine can I
ſcarce vtter one onely worde of
myne intēt, through the abundāce
of teares which my heart cauſeth
to diſtil from mine eyes, &c.
               Amplification is made, when
for to moue the Audiēce to honeſt
myrth & ſomtimes to indignatiō,
or ſometimes to pittie, there is
ſpoken in augmēting the termes
of the Cōcluſion, ſomthing for to
encreſe the termes & phraſes: as
to ſaye thus, Right honorable,
I aduertiſe you that the cauſe
appertayneth to God, and to
men of great authoritie. Alſo,
if you wyl not accept this charge
you refuſe a great goodneſſe and

honour which God doeth ſende
you.
               The Epiloge by nature ſhould
be briefe, and is made alwayes at
the end of the diſcourſe, whē brefly
and in ſūme, the reaſons, & arguments
in diuers places diſperſed,
are reduced together to be the
better fixed and imprinted in the
memory of the Audiēce, as to ſay,
Right honorable, and worſhipful,
what will you that I ſay vnto
you? I haue firſt told you ſuch
a thing, and ſuch a thing, &c. and
haue proued it by ſuch reaſons,
&c.
               The concluſion demonſtratiue
is made, as if a man ſhould ſaye
thus: For the excellent beuties of
women which are of ſuch Angelicall
ſhape, hauing the booke of
ſuch ardent liuelyhood, and the
ſpeach ſo gracious, do paſſingly

enamour the myndes of men.
               Furthermore it is to be noted
that diuers Epiſtles may begin
with a perfect ſentence, authoritie,
or common prouerbe:
prouided that it be altogether agreeable
to the purpoſe that we
entend to perſwade or diſſwade:
as for Example.
            
            
               Denys the tyrant, vvriteth to the
Burgeſſes of Naples.
               WHoſoeuer denieth his ſoueraigne

altogether vnexcuſable: For the ſoueraigne
Lord may and ought for the affaires
of him and his cuntrey demande
ayde of his ſubiectes, for to cōſerue them
in peace, ſeing that for them he daily hazardeth
him ſelfe in a thouſand perils of
death.An other Confirmation which is in forme of the Minor. Now ſo it is that I haue demanded
of you an hundreth thouſand duckats,
and ten thouſand men, for to make
warre vpon the king of Chipre: which
demaund you wold not, or elſe haue diſdayned

to vnderſtand,Two other reaſons, cō
                     firming and augmēting that which goeth before. much leſſe to accompliſh:
1 waying then the othe that
you made vnto me, I thought you wold
haue kept promiſe and fealtie: 2 & conſidering
alſo that you are not ignorant
of the great neceſſitie yt I haue bothe of
men & money, for the which I haue oftē
ſommoned and required you. Therefore
ſeing your infidelitie and rebellion,Concluſion. I accompt
you as enimies, and haue determined
to extend vpon you myne indignation
and crueltie, euen to the abandoning
and ranſacking of you and your
Citie, by fyer and ſworde, and generall
pillage of all your goods without any fauor
or pardō, the which thing you might
haue auoyded by loue, fidelitie, and obedience.
            
            
               An anſwere to the ſame
in like maner and
fo
                     •
                  rme.
               THe Law of impoſſibilitie is ſo great,
moſt high and redouted ſoueraigne,

that thereby euery man ought to be, and
is lawfully excuſed and frée of all ſomoning
and requeſt:The Minor. for there as is not
wherewithall, neither dominion nor
payment taketh place: according to the
common prouerbe,A prouerbe. where nothing is to
be had, the King loſeth his right. And as
lōg as we had wherwithal, our good wil,
and loyall corage hath alwayes obeyed
you, plainely manifeſting vnto you our
fidelitie and obedience, euen to the very
conſummation of our goods, and ſlaughter
of the ſtrong men, and youth of our
Citie: in ſuch ſort that now we haue nothing
remaining vnto vs,The Concluſion. but onely the
good will: Beſeching you moſt humbly
to mitigate, and aſſuage your anger and
fury, conſidering the great pittie and pouertie
of vs.
               Note that in all Letters,A three fold cōſideration to be had in all Letters.
or in moſte parte of them three
things ought to bee obſerued:
To wit, that the demaunde be
iuſte, that it bee poſſible, and to

ſhew the poſſibility, aſſigning the
rewarde of the benefit: & if theſe
things be not expreſly ſet, then
are they vnderſtanded. For if a
poore man write vnto a rich, to
lend him money, it is not nedeful
to declare his demaund to be iuſt,
nor to declare his poſſibilitie: but
it ſuffiſeth to praiſe the rich man
of his vertue & liberalitie, whereby
he helpeth the poore which
are ſuccourleſſe.
               Alſo he that demādeth to bynd
himſelfe, nedeth not to ſpeake of
the rewarde of the pleſure, nor
likewiſe whē the Father writeth
to his ſonne, or the Maſter to his
ſeruant, nor when a man writeth
to his frende.
               And here are to be noted foure
things which let & hinder the demaundant
from being granted.4. things to be noted.
               
               The firſt is to demand a thing

to great & more thā a man ought
wherefore ſaith Cato, Quod iuſtum
eſt petito,
                   aſke thy duetie and no
more.
               The ſecond is the tyme: as to
demaunde yee in ſōmer, or that
one ſhould paie an obligation, or
rente before the time be expired.
               The thrd is the place: as if my
debter ſhould owe me. x. pound,
to be payde in Paules Church, &
I ſhould demaunde it of him in
Weſtminſter Hall.
               The fourth is the cauſe: as to
demaund that which hath been
promiſed, notwithſtanding any
thing that is done or ſayd within
the certain time, & that it be not ſatiſfied.
As for Example: O Lorde
Chriſt I ought to haue and poſſeſſe heauen,
I am a Chriſtiā, I craue it of thée:
truely (he wil ſay) I haue giuen thée heauen,
if it be ſo that thou accompliſh the

will of my Father which is in heauen.
               Moreouer if it happen that in
Letters it be nedefull to make
partes anb diuiſions, let it be don
with breuitie: and likewiſe if
there be a Narraciō, as of newes
frō the court, or of wars, it muſt
be diſpatcht very briefly, & plainly,
in vſing cōmon termes, without
long clauſes or parentheſes.
               Thus hauing now declared &
ſet forth at large moſt part of the
neceſſary precepts, which belong
to the well compoſing and endyting
of Epiſtles and Letters, (I
ſay neceſſary, for if a man ſhould
make & compoſe an Epiſtle well
either in Engliſh or in any other
language, it were good to haue
the perfect vnderſtanding of all
the rules both of Gramar & Rethorike:)
preſently ſhalbe deſcribed
the Style and fourme of certain

letters. And firſt whē one mā
writeth for an other, commēding
him, to the ende he might obtaine
ſome dignity or prefermēt: & ſuch
a letter muſt containe .iiij. partes.
               The firſt way to get beneuolence
is in praiſing of him vnto
whom we write, for his liberalitie,
his bountifulneſſe, his iuſtice,
his vertue &c.
               The ſecond waie to purchaſe
beneuolence vnto him for whome
we write, is to ſay that he is modeſt,
gentle to euery one, & a man
not voide of knowledge.
               The third is, to make the demand
honeſtly & modeſtly, which
muſt be deuoide of the foure lets
and impedimentes whereof we
lately made mention: and in ſo
doing, that it be iuſt, honeſt, facill,
and for the which he vnto
whom we write may haue either

honor or profit by graunting it.
               The fourth, to promiſe him all
ſeruice and perpetuall obedience,
ſaying that what ſoeuer is demaunded
for and in the fauor of
ſuch a man, is eſtemed as though
it were for our ſelfe: as in this
Example.
            
            
               A Letter vvritten to the King, in fauor
of one pretending the order
of Knighthode.
               IT behoueth me not (moſt Chriſtian
King) to write familiarly to your ſacred
Maieſtie, for ſo might I be noted of
preſumption and 
                     •
                  oliſh hardineſſe, but
conſidering your benignitie and humanitie,
whereby you giue fauor and ſupportacion
euen vnto them that haue fully
deſerued it and vnto ſtrangers: For
this cauſe therefore I haue taken audacitie
to write vnto you vnder hope to
obtaine that which I erneſtly and moſt
humbly require. It is in the behalfe of
ſuch a one, a man bothe wiſe & valiant,

whereof I atteſt vnto you by the knowledge
that I haue had of long time, that
his name, armes, and high proweſſe are
approued of all people, in ſuch ſort that
(none diſpraiſed) he ought to haue the
praiſe and price aboue all. It is well
knowne (worthy ſoueraigne) what enterpriſes,
deliberacions, and ſubtilties
in the feats of warres, he vſed at the expeditiō
againſt the Turkes and Infidels,
eſpecially at the voyage of, &c. where he
caried away the honour, by the report of
men of good reputation and credite that
were there preſent: as namely of ſuch
a one, and ſuch a one. He is now determined
& euē redy to depart homewards:
But for the great affection that he hath
to ſerue your maieſtie (as he promiſed
me) he wold very gladly by you be made
Knight, and hath requeſted me to write
for him. And bicauſe that I conſider his
demaund to be iuſt, and very honeſt, and
that it is very decent and conuenable,
that he ſhould be preferred in honour, as
one that hath rightly deſerued no leſſe,
with great payne and trauail of his bodie,

and that this ſhal be an occaſion giuing
to other good & valiāt, hardy Champions
to ſerue you alwayes better and
better, waiting for ſuche lyke or better
reward. Therefore do I humbly beſech
you to haue him in remēbrance: Promiſing
your maieſtie, that aſwell I, as he
and his, wil render you immortal thāks,
beſeching God to maynteine & preſerue
you in your triumphant & quiet raigne.
               Note that we are not accuſtomed
to ſpeake by thou, nor thee,
as diuers other nations whome
we call ſtrangers and barbarous
people do, except it be in ſome reſpects:
whereby is eaſely perceiued
the loue, the gentle nature,
humanitie, curteſie, reuerence, &
honour that we haue and beare
one to an other: yea euen in wryting
& ſpeaking to our enimies,
and ſtrangers. Notwithſtanding
I wil not take in hād to reſtraine
any man by rule or otherwiſe, to

vſe either you, or thou, ſeing that
alreadie many good Oratours
haue vſed thoſe termes, as they
haue thought beſt: obſeruing as
I may rightly cōiecture, the perfection
of the Latine tong. And
likewiſe the Emperor, the King,
the Iudge, & ſuch other perſonages,
although their perſō be ſingular,
yet they vſe theſe termes,
we ſay, we wil. &c. And the cauſe
is for that they neither ſay nor do
any thīg without coūſel. Bicauſe
therfore that our elders & betters
haue ſo vſed thē, & that they haue
ben ſo obſerued time out of minde
& together alſo for other reſons,
I leaue them to the iudgement of
ſuch as haue deſyre further to
ſearch and finde out the cauſes of
things: for I intend to be briefe.
            
            
               Hovv to vvrite in a mans behalfe,
for a Ciuil cauſe.
               
                  
WRiting in a ciuil cauſe, we
muſt deuide our Letter into
foure partes: Firſt to get the beneuolence
of him vnto whom we
write, by prayſing of his iuſtice,
or other vertue, agreable to the
thing that we would obtayne of
him: ſaying that the good hope
that we haue to obtayn the thing
that we demaunde of him, doeth
moue vs to write vnto him. Secondly,
to purchaſe good wil vnto
him for whom we write. Thirdly,
to get beneuolēce through the
iuſt cauſe of the thing whereof
we intrete: ſaying that it is rightfull,
eaſy, playne and profitable,
and that thereof may enſue great
honor, profit and praiſe. Fourthly,
to open the demaund, requeſting
that he for whom we write
may be had in remembrance, in
promiſing our ſeruice, &c.
            
            
               
               The Example.
               THere is in you ſo great equitie of
Iuſtice, (right excellent and ſoueraigne
Iudge) yt it is manifeſtly known
not onely vnto me, but alſo to the whole
cuntrey: in ſuch ſort that euery one may
ſafely without any aduocate, commit his
iuſt cauſe into your hands, how poore ſoeuer
the man be, all feare, fauour, or diſdaine
caſt aſyde &c. For this cauſe, and
for the mutuall loue betwixt vs: good &
ſtedfaſt hope doth encorage me to write
vnto you in the behalfe of one of my
frendes, vniuſtly oppreſſed by his aduerſary,
truſting that you will preſerue vnto
him his right. For I aduertiſe you
(my Lord) that he for whome I write
vnto you, is my auncient and ſpeciall
frende and agréeable to all men through
his wiſdom and gentleneſſe, yea and by
his vertues getteth the loue & good will
of euery one. And bycauſe he hath before
you my Lord, certaine proceſſe, of diuers
wrongs & vexacions done vnto him by
his aduerſary, as he hath informed me,
therefore hath he requeſted me to write

vnto you in his behalfe, hoping yt by this
meanes, you will be vnto him a iuſt and
fauorable Iudge. For this cauſe, & for yt
he is my very ſingular frend, & alſo for yt
I wold ſhew him any ſeruice or pleaſure
yt I were able, I moſt earneſtly & hartely
beſech you to haue him in remēbrāce
for this & other his affaires, & proceſſe depending
before you. And in ſo doing, my
lord, he hath promiſed me to be your perpetual
ſeruāt & daily Orator, praying to
God for you & all your frends, & ſo will
all they do yt loue him, whereby you ſhalbe
prayed for and prayſed amongſt many
good & worthy men, of whome he hath alwayes
ye familiaritie & good acquaintāce
            
            
               Hovv to vvrite in ones behalfe for
an Offence or cryminall Cauſe.
               IN a criminal cauſe or iuſt excuſe
the Letter muſt be deuided into
foure partes. Firſt to get beneuolence
by expreſſing the vncorrupcion
and equitie of the iudge to
whome we write: And as for the
offender, to write that he hath alwayes
lothed & abhorred ſuch a

crime wherof he is accuſed or noted,
& that caſe may ſimply be aggrauated,
howbeit without excuſing
any thing at al. Secōdly, we
muſt ſay that although we neuer
thought to haue written of any
ſuch matters, yet we wer moued
thereunto cōſidering the cōmoditie
& profit ether publik or priuate
or the miſerable pitie of him for
whom we write, who in all other
matters was of good cōuerſatiō,
in whoſe perſō was neuer found
any other notorious fault, alleaging
his vertues & diligēce: & cō
                  ſequētly,
ſaying that the man is
to be regarded and not the voice.
Thirdly to cōmit to memory the
praiſes of the accnſed, recoūting
his vertuous acts & good graces.
Fourthly, to promiſe yt he will no
more do any ſuch thing, but yt frō
thēceforth he wil exerciſe all vertuous
acts, offering al ſeruice &c.
            
            
               
               Example.
               I Know for a certainty (moſt vncorruptible
Iudge) that you haue always hated,
abhorred, and had in abhomination
all ſortes of malefactours and euill perſons,
correcting them, and miniſtring
vpright Iuſtice, as muche as in you is
poſſible, eſpecially ſuch as through impie
                     •
                  ie
are wilfull murtherers of their parentes,
kinſefolkes or neighbours. And
for my part (moſt worthy and rightfull
iudge) I do not only require to flee their
company, but alſo deteſt their cruelty, in
ſuch ſort (that it is contrary to all humanitie
and to the publike weale) that I
deſire their baniſhment, impriſonment,
or puniſhment with ſharpe Iuſtice. And
although I haue ben inſtantly deſired to
write vnto you in the behalfe of ſuch a
one, who (as it is ſayd) hath committed
ſuch a fact &c. & is deteyned in your pryſons
in daunger of his life, as I am aduertiſed:
although alſo I thought the requeſt
reaſonable, yet would I hot in any
wiſe haue written vnto you (right honorable
Iudge,) for ſo ſlanderous a matter,

had I not ben prouoked thereunto
by the cōſideration of the vertues which
I know to be in him, in ſuch nūber that
it were to long to recite them. I aſſure
you (my Lorde Iudge) that this euil excepted
(if an euill it may be called, being
done in a mans owne defēſe, as I am informed)
he hath alwayes ſhewed him
ſelf an honeſt man, were it for ye defence
of ye town, or to mayntein iuſtice, wherin
he hath not ſpared his bodie, goods,
counſell nor frendes. And when there
hath ben any good act in hand, to apprehend
the body of any offēder, there hath
ben no man more hardy, nor that without
feare hath more fréely ventured him
ſelf in danger, wherby yet many woūds
and ſkarres are apparant in him. And I
enſure you (my Lord) that there is no
lambe more gentle than hée, nothing
more peaceable than he is: And there is
in this Towne none more valiant, hardy,
nor honeſter man, without diſprayſing
any. My Lord, I conſider that for
ſuch a caſe hapned by fortune (as this is
whereof I intreate) ſo many vertues

which are in the man of whom I write
vnto you, ought not to be quenched, requiring
of their owne nature fauour of
grace and iuſt ſupportation. Therefore
I beſech you (my Lord Iudge) to whoſe
pitie and benignitie I entend to direct
this Letter, and not to your ſeuere Iuſtice,
that it wold pleaſe you not to haue
ſo much regard to this pitifull chaūce ſodenly
hapned, but yt aboue all you might
haue regarde to his youth already wyſe,
ſage, and ſo full of vertue, that he is beloued
of many good men, for that he neuer
offended but in this matter, and is
well willing to amend, and neuer to returne
to any ſuch fault: Pleaſeth it you
therefore to deliuer him: whereof I hū
                  bly
beſech you, to ye end that he may yet
again hazard himſelfe, his body, and his
goods, in ech iuſt quarell.
            
            
               How to requeſt the counſaile
of an Aduocate.
               TO demaūd fauor in any thing
that is called an vncororall
benefit, as doctrine, counſayl, &c.

Firſt of al we muſt deuide the letter
into foure partes: The firſt
conteyneth that he of whome we
demaūd, hath power to giue that
which we would requeſt of him,
for by that meanes he ſhal not excuſe
him ſelfe by impoſſibilitie.
Secondly, to ſhew the demaund
to be iuſt & honeſt, to thende that
he excuſe not himſelf, ſaying that
he would do it gladly if the demaund
were iuſt. Thirdly, to
make the demaund, declaring it
ſelfe to be facile & eaſie. Fourthly,
to promiſe gold, ſiluer, or other
thing, & perpetual ſeruice &c. And
vpon this point it is to be noted
that in this kinde of ſtyle and
ſundry other ſortes of ſupplications
and demaunds, we muſt vſe
humble language, as much as
may bee: For humble ſpeache
is a great perſuaſion to obtayne

that which we require and demaunde.
            
            
               The Example.
               THe Incredible Eloquence that is in
you (right worſhipfull Aduocate)
ſhineth in ſuch ſort, that there are no Orators
in Iudiciall actes to be compared
vnto you: which thing giueth me ſtedfaſt
hope, that if it would pleaſe you to
take the charge of my cauſe and to conduct
it, I ſhould come to ſuch ende as my
heart deſireth. The quarel that I haue
is iuſt, and begoon agaynſt ſuch a one,
myne aduerſary, who through deceyte
and cauilacion, hath induced me to make
a bargaine with him very trubleſome &
hurtfull for me, whereof I haue ben diſmiſſed
by the King in his Chauncery, as
you may perceiue by ye ſpecialties which
are in my bagge. Therefore haue I this
recourſe vnto you, truſting of your good
counſell and that you will ſpeake boldly
for me before the Iudges, to ſuſteyne my
good right, whereof I preſently write
vnto you, hoping that you will willingly

employ your ſelfe thereunto, after that
you haue vnderſtanded the matter at
large, wherein I haue iuſt cauſe, although
the aduerſary party ſay the contrary.
And in ſo doing as my ſpecial truſt
is, and (as I humbly beſech you) I will
promiſe to recompenſe yeu with honeſt
and lawfull rewarde, the which I will
pay you largely, liberally, and incontinently
at your pleaſure. And ſo ſhall you
alſo haue my ayde in your affaires and
buſineſſe, and commaunde me as your
humble ſeruant to accompliſh the full
content of a good heart, to the pleaſure of
our Lord &c.
            
            
               Hovv to anſvvere in ſuch
a like matter.
               IN the anſwere of a matter called
an vncorporall benefit, that
is to ſay of Doctrine or counſell,
the diuiſion muſt be made into
three parts. Firſt, to get beneuolence:
declaring that for the loue
that we beare vnto him, we do

gently agree vnto his demaund.
Secondly, we muſt make offer of
that which is demaunded and required,
and of other greater matters,
in purchaſing good will on
the other ſide. Thirdly, we repete
the offer by enlarging & amplifying
of ſeruices, & that we deſyre
nothing more than to do him ſeruice,
& that we will therein do ſo
well that he ſhal haue occaſion to
holde himſelfe contented.
            
            
               The Example.
               I Haue receued the letters which it pleſed
you to write vnto me (my ſingular
& perfect frend) by the which I perceiue
the deſire, affection, & confidēce that you
haue in me, concerning the guiding of
your cauſe, & the matter of the allowing
of the kings letters, obteyned for you againſt
ſuch a one &c. I aduertiſe you, that
not onely for the good & iuſt action yt you
haue in this mater, wherunto euery vertuous
man ought to ſhew fauor: but alſo
for the ſingular loue frō the time of our

youth mutually cōſidered, (my dere frēd)
I accord vnto you, not onely for ye which
you require me, but alſo for all other fauor
& ſeruice, euen as one frend ought to
do vnto an other. In ſuch ſort yt you ſhall
not perceiue in me any ſigne of apperāce
to refuſe that labour. For I will wholly
& altogether endeuour my ſelfe for you
in this affaire, euen as for myne owne:
yea you ſhal vnderſtand (God to frende)
that I wil do more & better therein than
I am able preſently to ſpeake or write.
Certifying you (my ſinguler frend) that
I am redy to fulfill your deſire & cōmandement,
wherevnto ſoeuer it ſhall pleaſe
you to aſſigne me, and that nothing ſhal
more reioyce me, than to perceiue by you
to haue done any thing that doth pleaſe
and content you. &c.
            
            
               How to thanke an Aduocate for
a cauſe by him conducted.
               TO render thanks for an vncorporal
benefit, it behoueth to deuide
the letters into foure parts.
Firſt to get beneuolēce ſhewing yt
we know not howe to begin to

render him condigne thanks, by
reaſon of our inſufficiencie. Secondly,
the beneuoleuce muſt be
conſented vpon the thing: for we
muſt ſay, that it is very cōmodious
& profitable for vs. Thirdly,
we muſt render thanks after the
beſt maner that may bee, declaring
all due recompenſe, & offering
our ſelues. &c.
            
            
               The Example.
               I Know not (right wiſe and learned
Aduocate) by reaſon of the ſmalneſſe
of my vnderſtanding, how I might expreſſe
or write the fourme to render you
condigne thanks and worthy prayſe, for
the benefit that I haue receiued of you:
in that you haue not onely with a good
will taken the charge to conduct and folow
my proceſſe, whereof I wrote vnto
you, but briefly haue made expedition
therein to my profit, with ſuch apparant
diligēce, that you are greatly to be commended,
and vnto you belong immortall

thanks & praiſes, ouer & biſides my recō
                  pēce
& rewards. What greater ioy could
come vnto me, than to be out of care and
trouble which I was in for this proceſſe,
conſidering ye torment & wrōg yt mine aduerſarie
offered, & wold haue done vnto
me: wherof your careful diligēce hath deliuered
me, made me ioyful & quiet? this
conſidered, I know not how I may worthily
reward you, which notwithſtāding
I deſyre to the vttermoſt of my power.
Nowe ſeing that I eſteme the goodneſſe
which I haue receyued of you to be perpetuall
and immortall, reaſon wold that
I ſhould render you perpetuall and immortal
thāks, which is impoſſible for me:
therefore bicauſe I can not do it, I offer
you my body & goods, my ſelfe & myne to
remaine to you in continuall ſeruice. &c.
            
            
               How to requeſt a Corporall benefit.
               AS cōcerning the maner howe
to demaund corporal things,
as a booke, a horſe, or ſuch lyke,
the Letter muſt be diuided into
foure partes. Firſt, we muſt get

the good will of him to whome
we write▪ by praiſing his liberality,
and principally of the power &
authoritie that he hathe ouer the
thing that he is demaunded. Secondly,
we muſte declare our demaund
& requeſt to be honeſt & neceſſary,
& without the which we
cānot atcheue to our determinate
ende & purpoſe. Thirdly, that the
requeſt is eaſy to be granted, cō
                  ſidering
his abilitie, and that in a
more difficil thing, his liberalitie
is ordinarily expreſſed. Fourthly,
to promiſe recompence, as golde,
ſiluer, or ſome kinde of ſeruice.
            
            
               ¶The Example.
               I Haue knowen of long time (moſt renoumed
Doctor) your zele towardes ye
poore louers of learning & knowledge,
which you manifeſt by imparting to thē,
not onely your Doctrine moſt effectuouſly
& with good corage, but alſo doe not
ſpare to diſtribut euē to ye vnknowē your

temporall faculties, wherein you ſhew
your wyſdom and worthineſſe, getting
therby praiſe in the world, diuine grace,
& innumerable merits. You know (right
ſkilfull Doctor) that I haue a long time
ſayled in the déepe ſea of Theologicall
facultie, ordinarily hearing your ſacred
Lectures, but the want of bookes doeth
much hinder me from profiting in that
faculty, and I haue no aſſured recourſe,
ſauing to your liberalitie, without the
which I ſhold be cōſtrained to fruſtrate
myne endeuor, & to abandon my ſtudie.
The matter is not greatly difficill vnto
you to ayde me in this my great affaire
& vrgent neceſſitie, no more than to wil,
& may: for you haue in like maner kept
diuers other from falling downe, & haue
erected them to high dignitie. For this
cauſe I beſech you to lend me your boke
of Sentēces, that I may eſcape the perils
of diuers vncertainties & dark ignorances:
& in ſo doing I wil not ſhew my
ſelf vngrate towards you, in miniſtring
ſuch thāks & ſeruice as for me is poſſible
            
            
               How to anſwere, granting a Corporal benefit.
               
                  
HE that will decently aunſwer
Letters requiring a corporall
thing, muſt deuide it onely into
three parts. Firſt, to get the good
wil, declaring vnto him to whom
he writeth, that he is affected to
pleaſe him and to do him ſeruice.
Secondly, it ſhall be good ſomewhat
to praiſe the gift & graunt
without boaſting or vayneglory,
declaring that it is not only done
for that the graunt is profitable,
but for that he perceiueth that
ſuch a graunt is acceptable and
pleaſant vnto him to whome he
writeth, and that therefore he deſireth
to do it for him. Thirdly, in
offring the gift or graunt, he declareth
him ſelfe to be readie to
do any thing that hee knoweth
might pleaſure him.
            
            
               The Example
               
                  
THe Letters that I haue lately receiued
from you (my ſingular & perfecte
frende) haue giuen me great ioye and
ſpiritual recreation: for amongſt ye cares
and waighty buſineſſe wherewith you
know that I am ordinarily occupyed, I
take pleaſure and conſolacion to heare
of your newes, & chiefly that you ſhould
be ſtudious, to the end you might attayn
to the perfection of a ſkilfull and learned
man, which thing I coniecture wil come
to paſſe, for I ſée fewe that in ſtudying
are more diligent than you, wherein
you employ your ſelfe by continual vigilacion,
not loſing one Lecture nor diſputacion.
You write vnto me that I ſhold
ſend you my booke of Sentences: and ſeing
the earneſt affection that you haue
to profit in lerning, as you haue written
vnto me, I do eaſely and with a good wil
condeſcend vnto you, and fauoring your
requeſt I ſend you by this berer the ſaid
booke, to ye ende that hauing receiued it,
you may ſtudy at your pleaſure and for
your profit: which ſhall be greatly to my
contentation, eſpecially if God ſo graūt

that I may once ſée you a worthy doctor
in ye facultie. And I inſtantly deſyre you
yt if in any other matter you haue neede
of any thing yt I may helpe you withall,
that you wold not ſpare me, but cōmand
it, and by Gods grace I will acompliſh
it with a good will. &c.
            
            
               How to giue thanks for a Corporall
gift receiued.
               TO render thāks for the gift of
a corporall thing receiued, the
letters muſt be deuided into three
partes. Firſt to get beneuolēce by
reaſon of the thing giuen. Secondly,
to get beneuolēce by reaſō
of our ſelfe, ſaying that we haue
neither wit ſtrength nor goodes,
nor any other thing ſufficient to
anſwer vnto the gift, & the good
will. &c. Thirdly, to render thāks
in the beſt ſort that we can: offrīg
al things at his cōmandemēt. &c.
            
            
               The Example.
               
                  
COnſidering with my ſelf your great
liberalitie (right honorable Doctor)
and waying the magnificence of the gift
which it hath pleaſed you to impart vnto
me, I know not (as one altogether abaſhed)
what thing I eyther might or
ought to do: For if I ſhould not render
you great thanks for the good turne that
you haue done me, I were worthy to be
noted of to much ingratitude: or if I
ſhould take vpon me to thanke you, all
my wordes would not be able to ſuffice
that which my heart willeth & deſireth:
whervpon I ſhould by good right be reprehended
of ignorance. This notwithſtanding
(worthy Doctor) though I can
not ſet forth in effect, yt which wt a good
heart I would, for the which I hold my
ſelf bound vnto you, let it ſuffice for this
preſent ye I cōfeſſe neither to poſſeſſe nor
haue any thing which is thank worthy,
ſaue only ye good will, which wt his ſmall
power doth moſt hūbly thāk you. Doing
you to vnderſtād, yt as long as I ſhal liue
I wil remēber your beneuolēce & liberalitie,
wherin I will employ my prayers

to pray vnto God for youre good proſperitie
and helth, for I know none other
thing wherin I might better profit you:
But if God ſo prouide for me hereafter
that I may, you ſhal finde me redy to employ
my ſelfe for you, euen as I know
and confeſſe, that you haue vſed your liberalitie
towards me. &c.
               Here are to be noted ſix conſiderations
of thankes giuing,
which may take place as well in
the iudiciall gender as in the deliberatiue:
for thanks giuing is
a kynde of recompenſe: That is
to wit, we muſt conſider the benefit
and thing giuen, him that giueth
it, the time, the qualitie, the
value that is demaunded, and the
authoritie of him that demādeth,
together with the facultie of him
that is demaunded. Concerning
the gift or benefit, ther is to be cō
                  ſidred
whether it be great or ſmal
ſumptuous or paynfull, priuate

or cōmon, eaſy or difficult, much
or litle, good or bad. As touching
him that giueth, there is to be cō
                  ſidered
his liberalitie, & cuſtom of
giuīg. Alſo for the time, whether
we haue extreme neceſſitie, & that
none other of our frēds either did
it not, or knew it not, could not or
wold not do it, and that without
hope of ſuccor as a chāce vnloked
for, he did vs that benefit. And as
for the qualitie, whether he did it
for our profit or his owne, whether
by fortune or of ſet purpoſe,
whether liberally or by conſtraint,
or otherwiſe. As concerning the
value, it is by compariſon, as to
conſyder what it is that is demaunded,
how much, conſidering
alſo the compariſō of that which
is giuen, and of that which is demaūded.
And as touching the authoritie,
is to be conſidered what

maner of perſons they be which
demaund, for what cauſe: there is
likewiſe to be conſidred the faculty
of him that is demaūded, as alſo
the facultie of the recompence.
Moreouer it is to be conſidered &
noted, that he which demaūdeth
recompence hath three common
places. The firſt is Amplificatiō
of the benefits & good turns that
he hath done, of the paines & loſſes
that he hath had in doing him
good & ſeruing him, & then adnichilating
and counting nought
worth any rewarde that he hath
had, as to ſay thus: I haue ſerued
you at myne owne proper
coſtes, I haue cōſumed my youth
I haue deſtroyed my ſelfe for you
and yet haue I ben nothing recō
                  penced.
The ſeconde by compariſon
as thus: You haue heretofore
done me ſome pleaſure, but that

doth nothing approch, nor is not
worthy to be compared to the benefit
that I haue done you. The
third is by remonſtration, as for
to ſay thus: do you wel vnderſtād
that from henceforth there is no
man that will do you ſeruice, nor
kepe promiſe except you ſatiſfy
me, & therfore if you do not, I wil
declare it vnto euery one. Now
he that will deny ſuch benefits
done, or at leſt not recompēce thē,
may ayde him ſelfe by the three
reaſons aforeſayde in confuting
them: firſt by Amplification, ſaying
thus: A man ought not to
giue vnto wicked perſons any
good or excellent recompence, for
the paynes of a villaine are to
be made no accompt vppon. By
comparyſon, ſaying: If any by
their vertues haue hadde anye

benefit, the other vicious may
not looke to haue lyke preeminence.
By remonſtracion, in declaring
that the men are more couetous
of money than of vertue, &
that for a mans money he may
alwayes haue ſeruauntes moe in
number, than vertuous. Moreouer
recompēce or remuneraciō is
made in three ſortes, by will, by
word, and by deede. By wil when
the faculty, the tyme, and opportunitie
are not: and yet there remayneth
in the man a perpetuall
memory of the good deede which
he hath receiued, and wold gladly
render pleaſure for pleaſure, or
better. By word, when in giuing
thanks for the good turne which
hath ben done vnto vs, we binde
our ſelues to do all ſeruice to our
benefactour. By deede, when beſyde
the thanks of words, we recompence

the benefactour with
goods, with gifts, with ſeruice,
with mutuall loue: or at the leaſt
by offring to ſatiſfie.
               Thus much haue I thought
neceſſary to be expreſſed in this
place, and now it is time to enter
into the ſtyle of Miſſiue Letters
vnder the demonſtratiue gendre.
            
            
               Hovv to vvrite vnder the demonſtratiue
gender, in the praiſe
of ſome bodie.
               TO write in the praiſe or commendation
of any man, in ſuch
a reſpect the Letter muſt be parted
and deuided into three parts.
Firſt, to declare the inſufficiency
of our wits, as not able to
deſcribe the vertues, merits, and
praiſes, which belong vnto him
for whom we write, the which

we muſt ſay doeth ſurmount all
eloquent Rethorik, or other maner
of writing. Afterward muſt
be expreſſed ſome excuſe or cauſe
which moued vs to write. Secondly,
we muſt begin to declare
one of the vertues of him whom
we wold praiſe, and conſequently
with other general cauſes, ſaying
that of ſuch vertues & greater,
he hath ſuch number that we
were ſcarce able to recyte them
in many days. Thirdly, that thoſe
things which we haue written
are but ſmall matters in compariſō
of thoſe that we might write
& that it is no flattery nor adulacion
which we write, &c.
            
            
               The Example.
               ALthough (right honorable Lordes)
I haue taken vpon me a thing very
vnfit for my rude and ſmall vnderſtanding,

that is to expreſſe by my letters vnto
you noble Lords, the praiſes and noble
vertues of N. which are ſuch and in
ſo great number, that I know not at
whiche of them to begin, for the leaſt
which is not little, ſurmounteth all maner
of writing, & that ſuch a perſonage
can not be counted to much worth, nor
be to much extolled & magnified: This
notwithſtanding according to my ſimple
and rude maner of writing: I haue ventured
to write vnto you of his moſt worthie
prayſe. In the firſt place, I promiſe
you, and aſſure you that amongſt the
noble, expert, valiant and hardy men, he
hath alwayes ben the chiefe: for if there
be queſtion of worthineſſe as well of
body as at weapon, if there be queſtion
of ſtrength, and there withall of warfaring
proweſſe, be it on foote or on horſebacke,
alone or in company, at an aſſault
or in a gariſon, or if I ſhoulde ſpeake
of Doctrine bothe morall & politike, yea
or diuine, in all theſe and ſuch other
things, he as it were a verie mirrour

and ſpectacle: amongſt birds he is an
Egle, amongſt fiſhe 
                     〈◊〉
                   Dolphin, and amongſt
men a very Hercules. For counſayle
of the Citie and politike affaires
there is not his lyke, who is (and will
be) to your Citie no ſmall adornement,
whereby you ſhall get great renowne,
and ſtrangers the light of moſt euident
example. And bicauſe that my to rude
vnderſtanding knoweth not the maner
how to write the tenth part of his vertues,
and that my letter ſheld be to long
and tedious, it may pleaſe you to be content
at this preſent with this ſmall writing:
for I do determine to write vnto
you an other time more largely, & what
ſoeuer I write it ſhal be nothing but
mere truthe, deuoide of all faining and
flattery: & I aduertiſe you (my Lords)
that ſo much the more you ſhall know
him, ſo much the more wil you commēd,
praiſe, honour, and eſteme it a great
benefit to haue had the 
                     ••••
                  ledge, acquaintance,
ſeruice, ayde, ſupport, familiaritie,
frendſhip confederation, alliance,
recourſe, & cōpany of ſuch a perſonage &c.
            
            
               
               Hovv to vvrite vnder the Demonſtratiue
gender, blaming or
diſprayſing another.
               TO write in ye diſpraiſe of a man
we muſt deuide our letter into
three parts. Firſt to get good wil
vnto our ſelues, declaring that in
deede we do not loue, neither that
it is our commō vſe to write euill
of any man, but that now we are
vehemently vrged and conſtrayned
there vnto &c. Secondly we
muſt diſpraiſe the party in honeſt
and couert termes, and ſo placed
that it be not playnly perceiued
that we ſpeke for enuy or anger,
or otherwiſe: but onely that in
very deede the great pryde which
is in him doeth cauſe vs to ſay it,
to thende to abate his preſump
                  
                     •
                  ion,
and to reforme him. Thirdly
we ſhall excuſe our ſelues towardes
him vnto whome we

write, that if we haue written any
thing vnto him, which might
diſpleaſe him, we ſuppoſe him
to be wiſe ynough to know the
truth, offering. &c.
            
            
               The Example: vvherin a certain
man writeth to Cicero touching
the conſpiracie of Catyline.
               IT is not my cuſtome, (learned Cicero,
moſt renowmed and worthy of honor,)
by detracting and ſpeaking euill or blaming
of an other, as many do, to go about
to get vnto my ſelfe praiſe and renowme,
eſpecially when the vices of the
other doe touch me nothing at all: in ſo
much that although I my ſelfe be ſtandered
& greatly iniured by myne enimies,
I ſuffer it paciently, and hold my peace.
But yet conſidering with my ſelfe the
great Treaſons of Catiline, who notwithſtanding
neuer did me any diſpleaſure,
ſeing that he was determined as a
Traytour, to kéepe the whole Citie and
cuntry in ſubiection, by the ayde and ſupport
of ſtrangers, I coulde not abſtayne

my ſelfe from declaring it vnto you, to
the end that the whole being known, ye
might giue order, and conuenient remedie.
I aduertiſe you (worthy ſir, and
déere frende) that ouer and aboue the
other innumerable vices, pety trafficks,
trayſons and ſubtilties that are in him,
he communicateth day & night with the
curſed, peruerſe and wicked rybalds, ruffians,
& raſcal Roges of the Towne, he
prouoketh & corrupteth them with money,
and other damnable meanes, to conſpyre
with him the deſtruction of ye good
& noble Burgeſſes & Citizens: with full
determinate purpoſe to make a generall
cōmotion, to kill the wiſe & learned gouernors,
to fier theyr houſes, to ranſack
& ſpoyle their goods, & to do al the execrable
wickedneſſe that is poſſible. And this
is now manifeſtly & notoriouſly knowē
throughout the whole Citie. For he now
declareth himſelfe to be ſuch a one euen
in open audience, threatning them that
are in chiefeſt aucthoritie, in ſuch ſorte
that they are conſtrained to flee, fearing
a greater inconuenience: Therfore it is

neceſſary (my ſingular friende) to giue
politike order, and that brefly, to the end
that a greater euill do not enſue. I haue
not writte this vnto you for any hatred
or enuy that I haue againſt him, for ſo
ſhould I do wrong to complayne of him,
but that which I do is in fauour of the
publick weale, & to moue you as a good
and diligent Iudge, to redreſſe it by ſeuere
iuſtice, ſo far forth as it is nedefull,
to thend that we may remayne in ciuill
peace and tranquillitie: requiring and
beſeching you to addreſſe vnto me your
noble deſyres that I may accompliſh thē
according to my poſſibilitie.
            
            
               Hovv to vvrite by maner of Complaint
or lamentation, for
an iniury receiued.
               IN ſuch a caſe we muſt firſt get
the good wil of him vnto whom
we write, by reducing to his memory
the cauſe wherefore we are
moued and prouoked to let him
vnderſtād of our eſtate. Secondly,

we muſt make honeſt remonſtration
and reci
                     •
                  all of the wrong
that our aduerſary hath done vnto
vs, by reprouing him of ingratitude,
or ſome other villanous
vice. Thirdly we muſt require
counſayle, comfort, ayde, or demaunde
his counſayle, offring in
lyke maner. &c.
            
            
               The Example: vvherein Appius
vvriteth to Caeſar, of iniury
done him by Cicero.
               THe feruent deſire and ſingular loue
which you haue alwayes ſhewed vnto
me (moſt mighty Caeſar) doeth conſtraine
me to write vnto you my complaint
of an iniury which hath ben done
vnto me, to ye end to obtayn of you ſome
comforte, for I ſuppoſe that the iniury
doeth touch you as well as me, conſidering
the amitie and frēdſhip betwixt vs,
which through firme & ſtedfaſt acquaintance
ought to be common, as well in

proſperitie as in aduerſitie. And bicauſe
that within this moneth I haue ſuſteyned
very vncurteous and vnhoneſt iniuries,
I could not abſtayn from writing
vnto you, to the end that you might be a
relieuer and comforter of this greuous
trouble. You knowe (right renowned
Caeſar,) the pains, trauels, diligence, and
the great perils and dangers, wherein I
haue ben for this wicked perſō of whom
I write vnto you, not onely for to doe
him honor, but alſo profit. And when I
was iudge, you knowe in what magnificence
he was receiued of the counſel, yet
now hath he forgotten all the good dedes
& ſeruice that I haue done him. For notwithſtanding
that I my ſelfe requeſted
him and alſo cauſed him to be requeſted
by men of good reputation to defend my
cauſe, and to pleade it before the Senat,
yet he refuſed me, although he employeth
him ſelfe to the like for euery one,
yea euen for ſtrāgers, and them that he
neuer knew, nor that euer dyd him any
pleaſure or ſeruice. Yea and that which

is worſe, (to do me greater diſpleaſure)
he hath counſayled my aduerſary, and
found ſubtilties and cautoles to pleade
againſt me, in ſuch ſorte that I am depriued
of my right: beholde the godly
rewardes and recompences wherewith
this wicked vngrateful perſon had paid
me, for hauing done him ſo much pleaſure
and ſeruice. Vnto thee mighty and
puiſant Caeſar, I haue yet my remedie
to appeale, and to moue him of the vniuſt
ſentence which hath ben giuen againſt
me. Therefore do I humbly beſech
you that it would pleaſe you to admoniſh
him, that if remaining and perſeuering
in his ingratitude he will not
helpe me, yet at the leaſt that he doe not
hurt me, which thing I truſt that in fine
he wil doe, if it would pleaſe you to admoniſh
or commaund him. And you
ſhall charge me with your affaires as I
charge you with myne. &c.
            
            
               
               Hovv to vvrite vvhen one frend
comforteth another in an
iniury receiued.
               WHen we write to ſuch effecte
we muſt deuide our letters
into three partes. Firſt, ſaying
that we are maruellous ſory for
that iniury. Secondly, we muſt
ſhew him that for ſuch an iniurie
he ought not to vex himſelfe, adding
the cauſe. Thirdly, to comfort
him, promiſing our ayde &c.
            
            
               The Example: vvherein Caeſar comforteth
Appius, touching the
content of the letters here
before written.
               
                  I Haue receiued thy Letters (right redowted
Knight Appius) which haue
ſo much greued my heart that I can not
expreſſe it: yea I ſhould haue ſuſtained
the iniury which was done vnto thée
more paciently, if Tully had done it vnto
me: & verily I know how vnhoneſtly

he behaued himſelfe in thy cauſe, before
the Senate, who through corruptions,
againſt God and Iuſtice, cauſed thée to
loſe thy matter: which thing ſemed vnto
me very ſtrange at the firſt ſight, to
think how he 
                     •
                  urſt do it, conſidering the
great good dedes that thou haſt done vnto
him. For by that meanes, in ye iudgement
of all good men, he is greatly boūd
vnto thée, and therfore they wold ſcarce
beleue that he would offend thée: But
when I perceiued through thy Letters
his greate miſchiefe, I made it manifeſt
vnto moſt of them, who are very ill content
with him, and are as much diſpleſed
and as ſory euen as I my ſelf. But Appius,
when I conſider the malice and iniquitie
of Tully, and that therefore in
the ende he ſhall ſuſteyne more diſhonor
and damage thā the hurt which he hath
done vnto thée doth amoūt vnto, I then
reioyce and comfort my ſelfe. For his
ingratitude knowē, euery one wil mock
him, and will bewayle thy damage, and
by that meanes thy honor ſhall encreaſe,
and in the ende ſhal haue victory & glorious

triumph my ſelfe to reduce him to
thy ſeruice, ſhewing him his fault. And
I promiſe thée that I will not ceaſe, vntill
ſuch time that I haue reduced thée
victorious, and ioyfull: and therefore I
pray thée ſpare me not in any thing that
I may pleaſure thée.
            
            
               Hovv to vvrite a Letter of complaint
for a miſfortune, demaunding
counſell or conſolation.
               SVch an Epiſtle or Letter muſt
bee deuided into three partes.
Firſt to get beneuolence, declaring
that the good loue which
we haue together, doeth moue vs
to write our fortune, for to haue
conſolacion & comfort. Secondly
we muſt declare the caſe. Thirdly,
to demaund counſell, ayde. &c.
ſaying that in him conſiſteth our
onely hope, deſyring that we be
not defrauded of our intent, offering
our ſelues. &c.
            
            
               
               The Example: wherein a Father lamenting
the death of his ſonne
writeth to a frende
of his.
               I Would, my ſingular and déere frende,
had it ben the good pleaſure of our lord,
that within theſe thrée days you had ben
here with other my frendes, for to ſee the
griefes, lamentations, weepings, and intollerable
afflictions that I had and yet
haue for the death of my ſonne: for if
you had ben preſent, I knowe for a certentie
that you wold not onely haue had
compaſſion, with mée and other my good
frendes, but you ſhould alſo haue muche
ayded to haue reléeued me of my mortal
griefe. But bicauſe it is impoſſible, aſwel
for the time & alſo for the diſtance of
place betwixt vs, I haue thought good to
write vnto you by theſe preſents the dolorous
and greuous paſſions that ſynce
that day I doe intolerably ſuſteyne, hoping
that for the frendſhip which you
haue hadde with me ſynce our youth,

the which hath alwayes encreaſed together
with our yeres, I might receiue frō
you ſom cōfort. You know well ynough,
and are wel aduertiſed of the pouerties,
afflictions, inconueniences, perils and
dangers which they ſuffer in this mortall
world that beare charge in the common
weale: and likewiſe thoſe that in
the midſt of the multitude of their riches
doe liue in tribulations, and are continually
in ſorowful & miſerable troubles
and vexations. But as concerning me,
(to make a very heape of my ordinarie
afflictions) I had one little ſonne, ſo
ſwete, pleaſant, and amiable, in whom I
tooke all my comfort and recreation. For
his onely preſence, or his onely ſpeache,
did often reſolue me from my great fantaſies,
taking from me all melancholy,
yea he was my onely paſtime: but now
I poure out teares of ſadneſſe ſo much
the more, for that I knowe that death
hath ben cruell vnto me, who through
his enuie hath taken away my ſonne,
he hath killed my onely hope, my conſolation,
my lyfe, & him from whome came

all my ioy, and therefore do I now ſuſteyne
great wrath and melancholy, I
know not where to ſeke comfort, nor
what I ſhould doe, or ſay. And therefore
haue I thought beſt to write vnto you,
as to my ſingular and perfecte frende, to
the end that you might wayle with me, &
that it might pleaſe you to giue me comfort,
doing as you haue ben accuſtomed
to doe: for you haue many times releaſed
me from great calamities, through
your good councell and reconciliacion.
            
            
               How one frende should anſvver
another, comforting him
for his loſſe.
               THe letter muſt be deuided into
three partes. Firſt declaring
the griefe that he hath, which he
eſtemeth to be euen vnto himſelfe
in augmenting it. Secondly to
giue comfort by three or foure or
moe reaſons, concluding that it
is good to take comfort. Thirdly
to giue a certayne hope, offering

to do all things poſſible, and eſpecially
for his conſolation.
            
            
               The Example: wherein one frende
comforteth another, for the
death of his ſoone.
               I Bitterly bewailed (my moſt ſingular
and perfect frende, and could not keepe
in my teares, when I red the Letters
which you ſent me, making mention of
the death of your ſonne. And I aduertiſe
you that I was conſtrayned ſo to doe for
the good loue that of ſo long tyme hath
ben & is betwixt vs two, the which cauſeth
me to feele the lyke dolor and griefe
that you haue in loſing the preſence of a
childe ſo wel taught and of ſo good a wit,
and entrance of good maners, wherfore
I maruell not though in him did lye all
thy conſolation: For I thinke that if our
lord ſhould not ſende you ayde and ſuccour
in ſo great a tribulation, you wold
be conſumed with weping and wailing,
and would dye immediately after him.

Notwithſtāding through the prouidēce
that is in you, you know ye a man ought
not to vex nor greue him ſelfe beyond
the limits of reaſon, by the which all deſolacion
ought to be chaſed frō the harts
of men: and if it were ſo that you were
deuoide of reaſon, through the exeſſiue
dolour which you haue ſuffred to rule in
your hart (not conſidering that your
ſonne was mortall, that you haue begot
him mortall, nouriſhed him mortall,
& that he is mortally dead, rendring
the tribute of nature euen as it is appoynted
to euery one of vs) yet ſhould
neither my letters nor conſolacion ſerue
to no effect. But ſith in deede you know
well ynough that both yong & olde, yea
euen your ſelfe ſhall wax rype and dye,
ceaſſe therefore ſuch wéepings and lamentations,
which better beſeeme the female
kynde, than a wiſe and prudent
man, ſuch one as you are, and mitigate
your ſtrong paſſions with ſtronger reaſons,
in doing the déede of a vertuous
man: employ now your wyſdome, ſeing
that it is time & néedefull, to the ende

that euery one, (yea they that know you
not) may ſée to appeare in your perſō the
conſtancie and pacience which you haue
tolde them to be in you: I well remember
I haue oftentimes ſeene you reioyce
in proſperitie: and therfore if you ſhold
now ſhew your ſelfe otherwyſe, you
ſhould giue occaſion to think that it were
your cuſtome at ſometimes to reioyce, &
afterwards bitterly to ſorrowe. The remedie
againſt ſuch mutabilities and vnconſtantneſſe,
is equally to ſuſtaine all
proſperous and aduerſe fortunes. Therfore
at my requeſt, let not ſo many vertues
which are in you, remayne deuoide
of pacience. I know that you vnderſtand
this, and a thouſand other good reaſons
méete for ſuch a purpoſe, better than I
am able to ſpeake or write them vnto
you, yea you your ſelfe haue accuſtomed
to comfort your frendes being in aduerſitie.
And I aduertiſe you that this which
I write vnto you, is not to inſtruct or
teach you, but only to giue you to vnderſtand
the great good wil that I beare vnto
you, and that I wold according to my

poſſibilitie pleſure you both with body &
goods without ſparing of any thing.
            
            
               Hovv to vvrite letters being in exile,
vnder hope to obtaine reſtitution,
ayde, counſell, or
comfort.
               WE muſt deuide our Letters
into three partes: Firſt, to
purchaſe the beueuolence of the
perſon to whome we write, hoping
of his loue and prudence, by
the which he may vnderſtād, that
ſuch a fortune is common to all
men. Secondly, to ſhew the good
deedes that we haue done to our
cūtrey, or vnto him by whom we
are exiled, neuertheleſſe not vſing
any arrogācie, but to the end that
we may euidently ſhew that we
are wrongfully exyled, then ſhall
we declare through whoſe iniury
it was, as by our enemies. &c.
whome we know doe hate vs in

that they ſhew vs vngratitude &
iniury: Afterwards, we muſt ſay
that we hope to haue vpright iuſtice,
by the whiche we ſhall obtaine
honor, and our aduerſaries
be confounded & puniſhed. Thirdly
we muſt thereupon demaunde
ayde and counſell, recommending
vs and our matters to our frend,
which we willingly preſent vnto
him.
            
            
               The Example: wherein Cicero, lamenteth
to Lentulus, that for
the hatred of Clodius
he is exyled.
               IT is my cuſtome (my ſingular frende
Lentulus,) when there hapneth vnto
me any aduerſitie, to haue recourſe vnto
my frendes, for theyr ayde, counſel, or
conſolation. Therfore vnto you, whom
I repute not onely my frende, but aboue
all other moſt eſpeciall, for ye you eſteme

my aduerſities to bée yours) I haue
thought good to write a miſfortun which
is hapned vnto me through malyce: to
this ende that by your ayde and counſel,
I might in ſo great an euill fynde ſome
comfort and remedy. Euery one knoweth,
and it is common inough to all
men, what great paynes, trauells, and
charges, I haue manfully ſuſteyned, to
illuſtrate, defende, and preſerue the
publike weale, and ſo doing I haue
beſtowed not onely my goods▪ but alſo
my time and labour, which leauing vndone
I might haue profyted in other
greate affaires. True it is, that in ſo
doing, I haue obteyned honour, but you
know that the wicked doe alwayes malyce
the good, and can not ſuffer vertue
to haue place: for through their wicked
ſteights & ſubtilties they haue ſo wrought
that all the profit & commoditie that
I deſerued, & had of the publike weale, I
haue now in one houre loſt it al. Againſt
me is rayſed vp this wicked & hatred of
God & the world, Clodius, vnto whome

I haue done many good déedes, whereof
(as vngrate) he will not remember him
ſelfe, but ſhewing his malice, doth rendre
me euill for good, going about to put
me to death: for he hath inuēted a thouſand
fictions and dreames before the Senate,
& with his falſe wicked witneſſes
lyke vnto him ſelf, hath ſo wrought that
I am baniſhed & ſent into exyle: whereby
I am falne into ſuch ſorow & griefe,
that I eſteme the death to be much ſweter,
and leſſe paineful, than to liue in ſuch
torment. And certainly it were impoſſible
for me to liue any longer, if there
remayned not vnto me a certayne hope,
which cōforteth me, that is, that a tyme
wil come, wherin the truth ſhalbe knowen,
and my honor wholy reſtored, and
then ſhall I haue an ende of theſe euils.
And to the end that you might haſtē this
time, I pray you herein geue me ayde,
comfort and counſell, for of you onely I
require and demaunde it, offering vnto
you rewarde and gift of me, my family,
and goodes, with humble recommendations.
            
            
               
               How to comfort our frend in
his exile.
               VPon ſuch an occaſion we muſt
deuide our Letters into three
partes. Firſt, muſt be declared the
griefe that we ſuſtaine for the aduerſitie
of our frende, which we
muſt ſay to be cōmon vnto vs by
reaſon of our mutuall loue. Secondly,
we muſt get the beneuolence
of his perſon, by prayſing
his great wiſdome and vertue,
declaring vnto him the vyces of
his aduerſary, who through enuie
hath ben the cauſe of his exile.
Thirdly, we muſt put him in hope
ſhortly to returne, and to be reſtored
to his honor, with promiſe to
employ our ſelues to the vttermoſt
of our poſſibilitie.
            
            
               
               The Example: vvherein Lentulus comforteth
Cicero, who through the malice
of Clodius vvas exyled.
               I Can not giue thée to vnderſtand by
writing my (ſingular friend Cicero) nor
expreſſe vnto thée by any meanes what
and how great dolour and ſadneſſe I
had when I firſt conceiued by your letters,
that this falſe and wicked Clodius,
through hatred and yll wil had baniſhed
and expulſed you out of our worthy Citie.
And certainly my frende, I am not
only ſory for your aduerſitie euen at the
very heart, but alſo when and as often
as I remēber that he that hath done ſo
many good déedes to his Cuntry is thorough
enuie exyled, then guſheth from
myne eyes ſuch a ſpring of teares and
in ſo great abundance, that by good ſimilitude
they may rightly be called a very
Riuer, for the great loue that I haue to
you. And for a truth, it wold be ſo cōtinually
with me, if I were not reſtrayned
by thincking ye through great wrong, &
to the great diſhonor of them that did it,
you are thus exyled. Lord God, it is wel

knowne vnto thē what humanitie & gē
                  tleneſſe
you haue ſhewed thē, inſomuch
that to none were he neuer ſo baſe, you
haue at any tyme refuſed your paynes &
labours, were it for the weale particular
or publick, but with a certeine deliberate
benignitie haue ſtudied to pleaſe al,
without vſing any refuſall, diſdaine, or
arrogancie, which are vertues worthy of
great prayſe, cōmendatiō, & reward. And
yet through ye enuy of a miſcheuous flatterer,
a ſeducer of the people, hauing nothing
miſdone, are ſent into exile, euen
as though you were a Traitor or malefactor:
but ye violence yt is done vnto you
& the violēce of Clodius wil haue an end,
for they can not alwaies endure. Therefore
my dere frend, take vnto you a good
corage, & ſetting a ſyde ſundry ſmall cō
                  cluſions
which can but hurt, haue a good
hope, & cōſider ye till luck can not always
cōtinue in one place, for fortune is mutable
in hir dedes. Conſider yt you haue yet
many frēds, yea & though there were but
onely I my ſelfe, whom I think am not
one of ye leaſt, yet I wold hope by ye help
of god, that within ſhort ſpace ye malyce

of Clodius ſhould be vanquiſhed and the
truth knowne: & for my part I will ſpare
nothing, to the ende yt in ſhort time you
may be reſtored vnto your former honours
and dignities, and he ſhamefully
deiected and puniſhed.
            
            
               Hovv to vvrite expoſitiue letters, certifying
the vvitneſſe or notyce
of a thing.
               WHen we write Epiſtles or
Letters giuing to vnderſtād
of the witneſſe, hiſtory, or knowlege
of the witneſſe of any thing,
we muſt parte our Letters into
three parts. Firſt, to get beneuolence
towards our ſelues, declaring
that al is for the loue of Iuſtice
and veritie, to the ende that
thinnocent and iuſt be not opreſſed,
& that for the great loue that
we beare vnto him, to whome we
write we teſtifie the truth of that
which is demaunded. Secondly,

we muſt declare the full circumſtance
of the fact. Thirdly we
muſt ſay, that we haue certifyed
that which we know of a veritie,
& that if we ſhall know any more
either of ye or of any other matter,
we will gladly ſhew him pleſure.
            
            
               The Example: vvherin Cicero teſtifieth
vnto the iudge, that Clodius
vvas at Rome, the ſame
day that the ſacred things
of Ʋeſta were
violated.
               I Am requeſted by you (Iudges of equitie)
to ſay that which I know concerning
the cōtrouerſie betwene the honeſt
order of the Matrones of the one part,
and Clodius, for the violence of the ſacred
things of the good goddeſſe Veſta, on the
other part, to wit whether the day of the
ſame violēce, Clodius was within Rome.
Although (my Lords) yt I deſire not to
hurt any perſon, but deſire Iuſtice and
equitie to be rēdred vnto euery one: And

to cauſe the ſame to be obſerued & kept,
I wold rather chooſe to dye than to conceale
the truth: my Lords, I aduertiſe
you that the daye of the ſayde violence,
towards morning I ſaw Clodius in the
field of Mars, and about ſeuen of the
clock in the Euening, he ſupped with
Pompeus, and almoſt all the day I ſawe
him about the Temple of Caeſar, and about
three of the clock in the after noone
he went haſtely into his houſe, yet notwithſtanding
I know not wherfore. &c.
This which you deſyred to vnderſtande
of me (my Lordes) I haue written it vnto
you according to the pure veritie: and
if you know any other thing wherein I
might doe you ſeruice, you haue me to
cōmaund, and I to obey and do it.
            
            
               How to certifie ſome newes
lately happened.
               TO certifie ſome nouell or new
thing, the Letters muſt be deuided

into three partes. Firſt, we
muſt purchaſe beneuolence to our
ſelues, declaring that we are inclyned
to write vnto him, as vnto
our frende, of newes which hapned,
aſwell in publike affaires as
in priuate: for we know wel that
he taketh pleaſure to heare ſpeake
of them. Secondly, ſhalbe declared
the hiſtory, be it of Battaile
or other buſineſſe. Thirdly,
we ſhall ſay that that which we
haue written vnto him was not
to haue bin left behinde without
aduertiſement, promiſing
him that we will not complaine
of our labour in wrytinge alwayes
vnto him lyke newes,
prouided, that we know them to
be acceptable vnto him.
            
            
               
               The Example: vvherein one frende
writeth vnto an other of newes
of the Court.
               I Know (dere & perfect frend) the greate
deſire that you alwayes haue to vnderſtand
& know the things that are done
in this citie of London, for the profit of
the publike affairs, wherof you are a very
piller, and can not long abſent your
ſelf, but that your abſence ſhalbe lamented,
for the good loue and godly fauour
that you alwayes beare vnto the commō
                  weale,
in ſuch ſort, that your heart can
not be contented except you be aduertiſed
by ſome of your frends of the newes
that dayly happen. Therfore to pleaſure
you, and to doe you agreable ſeruice,
euen as I am bounden, I haue thought
good to write vnto you ye which is lately
happened ſince your departure. Vpon
Tewſday laſt in the morning, newes
were ſpread abrode by a Poaſt, through
out the whole Citie, and euen vnto the
eares of my Lordes of the Courte, and
of the Citie, that there was in this Citie

great abundance of Ruffians, and other
ſuch hurly burlies of wicked people, called
Roages, who in the night time make
and commit manie execrable crymes
throughout the towne. Through which
occaſion the counſell aſſembled, dyd deliberate
to knowe what was to be done.
And after all opinions, there was ordeined
a newe watch of the burgeſſes and
inhabitants of the Citie, and that euery
one ſhould hang forth Lanterns & Candle
light, to giue light in the night, and
that vpon great forfeicts: which is done
according to the ordinance &c. Moreouer.
&c. Thus haue I written vnto you the
newes, whiche I know at this preſent,
and if there come vnto my notice any
other thing worthy to be knowne, I wil
write it vnto you incōtinently, not thinking
much at my trauel, as well in this,
as in other things, by the which I may
pleaſure you. Recommending me vnto
your good honour.
            
            
               
               Hovv to aduertiſe one, of the
conditions of another.
               LEtters to aduertiſe the conditions
or maners of any perſon
muſt be deuided into three parts.
Firſt, we muſt get beneuolence to
the perſon of whome we write,
ſaying yt we haue don our diligēce
to enquire of the maners, and to
haue knowledge of the perſon, or
of the thing wherof we intreate:
but if we write of our ſelues, we
muſt omit the firſt parte, and in
ſteade thereof purchaſe beneuolence
to our ſelues, excuſing vs yf
peraduenture we ſaye any thing
of our ſelues, that it is not for arrogancy,
but euen onely to make
vs to be knowne vnto him, that
deſyreth to vnderſtand what we

are: and that done go forwarde
with the thirde parte as before.
Secondly, we muſt make recitall
of the maners & conditions, &c.
Thirdly, we ſhal ſay that this is
all that we know at this preſent,
of the perſon or of the thing, being
redy to enquire more and alſo
cauſe it to be manifeſted. Offering
our ſelues &c.
            
            
               The example: wherein Cicero declareth
vnto Caeſar, the conditions
of Appolonius
of Rhodes,
Orator.
               THere is nothing ſo difficile, weightie
or paynefull (Noble Caeſar)
which with a frée heart, for the
loue of you, I would not take in hande,
throughe the ſingular and affectuall good
wyll the which I doe beare vnto your
moſt noble Maieſtie: And thereunto

I féele my ſelf bounden, by meanes of ye
benefits & gratulations yt you haue done
& ſtil daily do vnto me. You haue writtē
vnto me that in all diligence I ſhould
enquire of the maners and conditions of
Appolonius of Rhodes, and that I wold
write vnto you the veritie. I do you to
vnderſtand, that in the iudgement of all
thē that know him he is a ſingular man,
and not onely in Rhetorike, but alſo in
Philoſophie, doeth get by his workes an
immortal name. And I certifie you, that
when he departed from Rhodes he went
vnto Athens, and there found not his
lyke, in ſomuch that the Students ſayd,
that he was a ſecond Pallas, yet once againe
deſcended from the braine of Iupiter
into their Citie. Many other things
might I write vnto you of him, but
wherefore? For whoſoeuer you ſhal enquire
of, you ſhal fynde them to haue the
like good opinion of him: ſo that if you
cauſe him to come to the Citie, you ſhall
do a ſingular cōmoditie, not onely vnto
your ſelf, but alſo to the whole common
weale. And if you will that I ſhal do any

other thing for you, beholde I am altogether
redy to pleaſe and obey you, recommending
me once againe vnto your
good grace.
            
            
               Hovv to vvrite a Proficiat or Congratulation,
for an Office,
or Dignitie.
               WHen a man hath obtained an
Offiice or Benefice, or, any
other thing by his good fortune,
& that we would ſhew our ſelues
to be ioyfull of it, we muſt deuide
our letters into three parts. Firſt
beneuolence to the perſon vnto
whome we write, with commending
of his merits and vertues.
Secondly, to declare our affection
by the which we doe participate
of his ioye. Thirdly, to pray
vnto God that the ſame dignitie,
office, or fortune may be vnto his
profit, and perpetuall praiſe, offering

our whole ſeruice. &c.
            
            
               The Example: vvherein one frend
reioyceth with an other of the
office that the king hath
giuen him.
               
                  I Know not whether vnto me or vnto
you, ſingular frend, I ought to ſay Proficiat,
for the office which through your
vertues and ſpedy diligence you haue
obtained of the king, and I aſſure you
that the profit, honour, yea and glory, if
it be lawfull to glorifie in wel doing, are
of no ſmal eſtimatiō, ſith in ſo yong age,
you haue obtayned ſuch dignitie, & ſurpaſſed
the merits of your elders, whereof
I ought muche to reioyce: for from
hence forth your vertues ſhall be manifeſted,
and my honours and profit ſhall
encreaſe, ſeing that I haue ſuch a frend,
who through the brightneſſe of the glorie
hapned vnto him, ſhal driue from me
the darkeneſſe of griefe, and ſhall cauſe
me to haue good participation of his honours,
ioye and profit. Much good doe it
you therefore this dignitie, which you
neuer obtained through ambition, but

onely through the vertues that are in
you, for the which there are yet greater
benefits due vnto you. And as for my
parte, it is not without a cauſe that I reioyce,
for the benefits of fortune are common
omongſt frends, & cauſeth the loue
which is in both their bodys to haue but
one ſpirite, and in bothe of them is perceiued
but one only minde. I beſech God
that you may ſtill proſper & go foreward
frō good vnto better, & that by your vertuous
faith you may purchaſe immortall
glory, and as long as you lyue to remayne
in his holy fauour and grace
            
            
               Hovv to vvrite Letters reioycing
for oun frendes health, or ſafe returne.
               IF your frend haue recouered his
helth, or be ſafely returned from
his iorney, in ſuch a caſe our Letters
muſt bee deuided into three
partes. Firſt, to get beneuolence,
of our owne behalfe, for that we
were ſore affrayde of his ſickeneſſe,
or that there ſhould happen
vnto him any miſfortune or aduerſitie

abroade in his voyage.
Secondly, to declare the ioy that
we haue had of his mending, or
returne, praying vnto God to
kepe him from all euill. Thirdly,
to offer our whole ſeruice. &c.
            
            
               The Example: vvherein one frend
reioyceth of anothers recouery
to health.
               IT is not poſſible for me to write vnto
you, neither is the heart of man able to
thinke, (my ſingular and perfect frende)
what ſorrow and griefe I had when it
was reported vnto me that you were
greuouſly ſick, & in great danger, for then
me thought that I euen felte your ſickneſſe,
through the good wil and loue that
I beare vnto you, and wold gladly that
my ſorow might haue diminiſhed or eaſed
your paſſion. But by ſuche and lyke
meanes that I had greate ſadneſſe, and
griefe, for the firſt newes: I haue now
ineſtimable ioy, for that it is tolde and

affirmed vnto me for a certaintie, that
you haue wholly recouered your health
and welfare. I giue vnto you the Proficiat
vobis. (my ſingular frende,) for ſuche
a treaſure recouered, and beſech our lord
that he will preſerue and kepe you in as
good and long helth, as I wold wiſh euen
vnto myne owne perſon. And I giue you
to vnderſtād that I. N. M. and all the reſt
hereabouts, are (thanckes be giuen to
God) in good health and welfare, preſt &
redy to accompliſh all your good requeſts
and commaundement.
            
            
               How to exhort to vertue and
to good maners.
               TO exhorte vnto Vertue and
goodneſſe, bee yt to auoyde
griefe, or to get profit, the letters
or Epiſtles muſt be parted into
foure partes. Firſt, to acquire beneuolence
by reaſon of the matter,
declaring how worthy it is,
how profitable and neceſſary for

him vnto whome we write, and
thē, that it ſhalbe a worthy praiſe
for euery good man ſo to doe. Secondly,
ſhalbe expreſſed the thing
to be poſſible and eaſy to be done.
Thirdly, that it is very neceſſary
for him to doe it, and if he doe it
not, that there may happen vnto
him damage & diſhonor. Fourthly,
and fynally, to declare what is
to be done: and this latter parte
may bee placed in ſuch order as
ſhall ſeme good vnto the endyter.
            
            
               The Example: vvherein a frende
exhorteth a yong man to obtaine
vertue.
               THere is nothing in the world (wittie
yong man) that more profiteth aſwel
to atcheue to common as priuate goods,
nor which cauſeth more to augment and
get honor and good renowne, than the

trade of good maners and vertue, for by
that meanes the wiſe, not onely in their
houſes, haue taken a forme of regiment
by good order keping, but alſo kingdoms
and publike affaires are by them gouerned,
mayntained, and augmented. Beholde
the Athemans, the Romains, and
diuers other, haue they not alwayes floriſhed
when vertuous and wiſe men had
the gouernmēt of their publike weale?
And further I may well ſay that a man
whiche hath vertue in him, doeth ſhyne
with ſuch a grace, that he may eaſely be
exalted and eleuated from baſe eſtate into
high honor, & get immortall prayſe.
For this cauſe, and for the ſingular loue
that I haue vnto you, I haue willingly
thought good to moue and ſtirre vp your
corage to the attayning of vertus, conſidering
the good diſpoſition, and the beginning
of a good ſpirite that God hath
endued you withall, whereby you ſurpaſſe
all other your companions: not yt
I do miſtruſt the courage yt you haue to
ſtudy, but more & more to animat you in

your good purpoſe: Neuertheleſſe (my
welbeloued) I conſider that your ſtudie
is ſomewhat difficil, but I aſſure you yt
ye fruite thereof is very profitable, wherunto
a man may eaſely attayn without
great paine. There reſteth but onely to
haue a deſyre to become a worthy man,
and a good corage to ſtudy well, eſpecially
in good Sciences, to accuſtome to good
maners, getting wiſdome and vertue, &
by this meanes ſhall we pleaſe God, be
beloued, prayſed, and honored of men.
Therefore I beſech you my frende loſe
not your yong yeares in ydleneſſe, which
leadeth the blynde to all gluttenous voluptuouſneſſe,
and maketh a man weak,
ignorāt, poore, vnfortunate, full of ſhame
before old age cōmeth, which is altogether
vnprouided for, and to late to be remedyed.
Moreouer (my well beloued)
conſider that in this Citie there is great
nede of wiſe men, for to gouerne ye publike
affayres: And if you do your endeuor,
there is no man liuing that hath a
better meane, than you haue, conſydering
the place and houſe from whence

you are deſcended, and the faculty that
God hath giuen vnto you.
            
            
               Hovv to diſſuade our frende from
reioycing vnaduiſedly or
fooliſhly.
               IF we intend to diſſuade a man,
that he reioice not vnaduiſedly
or that he do not a thing which
he thinketh to be good, & is not,
then muſt we deuide our Letters
into foure parts, as before. Firſt,
ſhalbe declared the diſprofite of
the thing, if he doe it, and how it
may be hurt full, for that it is vniuſt
and diſhoneſt, not agreable to
a good man. Secondly, that he
ceaſſe & deſiſt frō his purpoſe, declaring
vnto him what he ought
to doe. Thirdly, how eaſy it is to
leaue it. And fynally, how neceſſary
it is to doe that which we
counſell him, offring. &c.
            
            
               
               The Example: vvherein Cicero diſſuadeth
Curio from reioycing
that Caeſar is made
Emperoure.
               THe common opinion of all Philoſophers
and wiſe men (worthy knight
Curio,) is, that there is nothing more
vnhoneſt, vniuſt, and pernicious, than to
reioyce of the deſtruction of the publike
weale: & he is ſo much the more worthy
to be blamed & diſpraiſed, as to oppreſſe
he would receiue praiſe, or glorifie him
ſelf with priuate vtilitie, ſith that for the
preſeruing of ye publike weale, we ought
to hazarde our ſelues euen to the very
death. And I vnderſtand that you reioyce
euen to the vttermoſt for the victory of
Caeſar, in ſuch ſort that it is openly perceiued,
and can not therefrom witholde
your ſelfe, wherfore I greately lament
your ſimplicitie for letting your ſelfe to
fal into ſo great an errour, as to reioyce
of your owne ruyne, your parents and
frendes, your Citie and the whole common
weale. Therfore I erneſtly requeſt
and praye you to leaue of this vnconſidered

and immoderate delectation & reioycing.
And notwithſtanding all this, I
haue ſo good an eſtimation of you, that
you are not deuoide of ſenſe, but that
ſhortly you will perceiue your errour, &
conuert this fooliſh ioy into bitter mourning,
conſidering the euil that foloweth.
For lyke good and loyall Burgeſſes, you
ſhall well think that the libertie of all is
conuerted into miſerable captiuitie, the
which to recouer, euery one ought to expoſe
him ſelfe euen to the very abandoning
of his life. And therefore in all calamities,
miſeries and troubles, it is not
neceſſary onely to remedy this your ſuch
reioycing, but it is alſo very conueniēt &
decent to bewayle and lament continually
the damage of your cuntrey, of your
nation, and of your Citie, whoſe execrable
ruine is now begoon, and from daye
to day will greatly encreaſe through the
multiplication of moſt wicked people,
and many other apparaunt myſeries
and greuous perditions, which will bée
executed ſooner than you doe thinke for,

the which to auoyde, it were rather to
be deſired to dye than to lyue. Ceaſſe
therefore to reioyce, and begin to lament
your publike weale, and if you haue no
pitie of ye publike weale, yet at the leaſt
haue pitie of youre neighbors, and of
your owne ſelfe.
            
            
               How to write letters exhorting
to lamentacion.
               BE it for miſfortune priuate or
publike, the Letter muſt be deuided
in foure parts. Firſt, to ſay
that it is bothe iuſt and honeſt to
beewayle the aduerſitie of oure
frende, or of the affaires of the
publike weale, ſeing that in ſuch
a caſe the calamities are as it
were oure owne. Secondly, to
ſhew the caſe, thereby to moue
lamentation. Thirdly, to exhort
to bewayle it. Fourthly that it is
neceſſary ſo to do, to the end that
after the griefe and affliction, remedy

may be ſought, promiſing
to doe for him. &c.
            
            
               The Example: wherein Cicero, exhorteth
Plautus to lament the
oppreſsion of the publike
vveale
               WE are cōſtrained, (my frend Plautus,
as well by deuine as humaine
right, next to the honour of God to expoſe
and venture al that we haue for the
ſafegarde of the cōmon weale, the proſperities
whereof ought not onely to reioyce
vs, but alſo the aduerſities thereof
ought to cauſe vs to lament & greuouſly
ſorow euen as our owne: yea & further
we ought for it to hazard our life vnto
all dangers, for to preſerue and defend it.
This hath cauſed me to write vnto you,
for the miſerable ſtate of oure deſolate
Citie, to this ende that you ſhould lament
with me and bewayle our ruine &
perdition. And for the firſt, you ſhould
vnderſtand that I am diſmiſſed and deſtitute
of the dignities and authorities

wherin I ſhyned in the Senate, through
the malice and iniquitie of Caeſar, who
cauſeth himſelfe to be called the Monarchal
Emperour, and hath not onely chaſed
away the Fathers & Senatours, but
alſo from great and ſmall hath taken away
the name of libertie. Who can be
of heart ſo hard, to abſtaine himſelf from
teares and lamentations, ſith our libertie
is thus loſt? what reſteth there now
but that with me & others you bewaile,
ſorowe, and lament ſuch miſfortune. And
if it be ſayde that it is neceſſary to augment
my ſorow and poure out teares,
in ſuch ſort that ther may be found ſome
maner of playnt, which may remedy our
iniury, by doing ſome laudable déede, I
aſſure you that with him that wil enterpriſe
it, I will not refuſe that labour but
will hazard in all damages bothe head &
life, & wil be one of the formoſt to haue
againe & recouer the liberty loſt.
            
            
               Hovv to diſſuade from ſorovv.
               WHen we write letters diſſuading
from ſorow and lamē
                  tation,

we muſt deuide them into
foure parts. Firſt, to declare that
it is diſhonor and damage in ſuch
a caſe to ſhew himſelfe ſorowful,
conſidering that euery wiſe man
ought of dutie to ſhew him ſelfe
equall, aſwel in proſperitie as in
aduerſitie, and that the matter it
ſelfe giueth no occaſion of griefe:
and thereto may we adde if we
will, a reaſon by the whiche we
may ſhewe him that to remayne
to much in ſuche ſorrow, it were
diſhoneſt. Secondly, it behoueth
to enforce our ſelues to conuert
the ſame ſorow into ioy. Thirdly,
to ſhew by good reaſon that he
ought to reioyce. Fourthly, that it
is neceſſary to leaue ſuche griefe
and ſadneſſe, alleaging ſome reaſon
for the ſame purpoſe.
            
            
               
               The Example: vvherein Brutus diſſuadeth
Marcus Antonius,
from ſorrowing for the
death of Caeſar.
               A Good man of duetie (my frende
Marcus Antonius,) ought not onely
to loue the proſperitie of the common
weale, but with al his power to aduance
it, and being aduanced to kepe and preſerue
it, and alſo for it to hazard his life
euen to the very bludſhed, if it ſo be
nedefull: and he that doeth not ſo, is
worthy of great reprehenſion, and greuous
puniſhment: and certainly it is not
laudable, but very deteſtable and diſhoneſt
for a particular profit, to conſume
the publike profit, and he that ſo doeth
ought ſhamefully to be throwne downe
to death, and not worthy to be lamented
of his frendes. But bycauſe I ſée that for
the death of Caeſar, you poure out abundance
of teares, therfore can I not chooſe
but much maruell of you, ſith you haue
always ben a loyall Burgeſſe, and that
not onely the common weale hath ben

through you augmented, but alſo vnto
them yt haue thereunto ben cōtrary you
haue always ben a rigorous hinderer, a
ſtraite iudge, & an inuincible defender,
more than though they had offēded your
owne perſon. Therefore take vnto you
againe your olde cuſtome, and be not
greued for the death of ſo cruell a tyrāt,
which death all ye world ought to deſire,
and thereof to reioyce, bycauſe he had taken
away our libertie, and deſtroyed our
publike weale, for his priuate pleaſure.
Wherfore me thinketh that for ſuch a
death you ought rather to reioyce than
to ſorrow: ſith that by the death of ſo
wicked an vſurper we are returned into
our former libertie. Deliberate therfore
to reioyce your ſelfe with vs. And take
good heede that in our company you be
not perceiued to be ſad in heart nor in
countenance: I aſſure you that it is neceſſary
ſo to doe for the auoyding of ſuſpition
in your perſon, praying you that
if you would haue any thing of me, doe
but commaund it.
            
            
               
               Hovv to vvrite Inuectiue Letters, reprehending
either frende or
enimie, for ſome cryme,
or ignorance.
               INuectiue Letters muſt be deuided
into three partes. Firſt, we
muſt get beneuolence of our own
behalf, ſaying that not willingly
but by cōſtraint we haue written
it vnto him, & ye we haue long time
cōcealed it, but bicauſe he ſtil cōtinueth
from euill vnto worſſe, we
haue thought good not to endure
any more of ſo euil a man, whoſe
wickedneſſe might do great hurt,
if they were not corrected. Secōdly,
to declare the matter whereof
we will reprehende him, in alleaging
reſons fit for that purpoſe.
Thirdly, if he be our frend, to declare
it with gentle language,
admoniſhing him louingly, and
ſhewing the incōueniēces which

might enſue if he ſhould hereafter
doe any ſuch matter. And if he
be an enimie, to get beneuolence
on our behalf, ſaying that we doe
not diſdayne him, nor that wee
would any more inuey againſte
him, to the ende that he ſhoulde
not think that we haue done that
through hatred, which in deede
we haue vprightly done, ſtill deſeruing
to ſpeake ſomwhat more
amply an other tyme when place
and tyme ſhall ſerue.
            
            
               The Example: wherein Cicero inueyeth
againſt Lucius Catilina,
who conſpyred againſt
the publike
weale.
               I Know not any thing at this preſent
(Lucius Catilina) wherewith I am
more intollerably gréeued, and which is
more painefull vnto me, than to haue

knowne, and to haue ben aduertiſed, by ye
report of diuers through their Letters,
that you haue conſpyred agaynſt your
cūtrey, the which to preſerue, you ought
willingly, and with a noble courage, to
chooſe euen the death: & in aſmuch more
as ye publike profit is to be preferred before
the particular, ſomuch the more is it
a wicked & deteſtable thing vnto him ye
enforceth him ſelf to hurte yt And I aſſure
you, had it not ben for the great affection
and loue that I beare vnto you,
I would rather haue choſen to haue holden
my peace, and to haue paſſed vnder
ſilence, than to write vnto you of it: but
I haue thought good to aduertiſe you, to
the ende that of your ſelf you may iudge
and know your fault. What is the fury,
rage, or rather diuelliſhneſſe that might
moue your heart to conſent vnto ſo horrible
and brutiſh a matter? where is he
that durſt th
                     •
                  ncke that ſuche a damnable
cryme could be committed by any man?
but eſpecially by a Lord, a Burgeſſe, & a
neighbours ſonne of the Citie? Are you
of the Romaine bloude? dare you vnto

your neighbour, nay rather vnto your
ſelfe, put to your hand for to ſhed bloud?
Doe you take pleaſure to heare yong
children wéepe? noble dames lament? &
good olde men diſcomfort? when they &
euen your owne parentes and frendes,
ſhall ſée the death of their Fathers, huſbāds,
wiues, childrē, their goods ſpoyled,
their houſes burnt and deſolate? would
you haue no pitie of the deſolated Senate?
Alas, haue at the leaſt pitie vpon
the Temples and ſacred places, & ſet all
theſe things before ye eyes of your reaſō,
& conſider what pitifull ende might follow.
You may peraduenture ſay that I
deſire dignities, honours, and authorities:
Alas, what authoritie honor, or dignitie,
may a man fynde in the cominaltie
deſolated? in ye publike weale periſhed?
in teares & depopulation of the Citie?
Certainly in my iudgemēt, ther are neither
dignities, honours, nor authorities,
but only thoſe which are gotten by vertue,
& I know not any thing of greater
vtilitie, or greater glory amongeſt men,
thā to be vertuous in ye publike affaires.

Therefore are you greatly deceiued, if
you ſpeake for immortall glory by oppreſſing
the publike weale. Take good
héede leſt hoping and thinkyng to get
name of immortall life, you loſe not in
a moment your temporall life, getting
ſhame, diſpraiſe and diſhonour for euer.
Thirdly, caſt of from you, I pray you,
ſuch vnclemency, and apply your ſelfe to
ſerue the publike weale, which may adorne
bothe you and yours with greate
and precious ryches, to the end that you
being gently reconcyled, may ioyfully
lyue with vs, in the quiet peace of the
cuntry, to your glory and praiſe. And ſo
doing you ſhall fynde me always redy to
ayde you to the vttermoſt of my power.
            
            
               How to write expugning Letters,
either to frend or enimie, for
charging vs with a
faulte.
               LEtters repugning as well to
frend as enemie, excuſing our
ſelues, or denieng the matter, are
made in two ſorts: For if it be our

frend that peraduenture doth accuſe
vs ſecretly, it behoueth to vſe
modeſt language by maner of excuſe.
But if it be our enimie we
muſt defend our ſelues playnely &
frely of ye cryme by him impoſed, &
in both ſortes we muſt deuide our
letters into three parts. Firſt, we
ſhall ſay we are to be excuſed, either
for that it is not ſo, or that
through imprudencie, malice or
enuie, he hath inuented that matter
againſt vs. Secondly, be it to
frend or enimie, we ſhall ſay to
our frende vnder correction, and
to our enimie freely & ſtoutly that
he himſelfe may be reprehēded of
the like caſe, or of the very ſame,
yea or elſe of a greater infamie,
ſaying yt he ought rat
                     ••
                  r to haue
regard vnto himſelfe, than to entermedle
with blamīg a nother.

Thirdly, if the Letters be to our
frende and vnder correction, we
muſt promiſe neuer to returne to
commit ſuch a thing: exhorting
him likewiſe to take heede vnto
him ſelfe, for the matter whereof
we haue enformed him. Yf it be
to our enimie, we ſhall playnely
exhort him to leaue of his detracting,
and that if he cōtinue to ſay
what he will, he ſhall heare what
he wolde not. And if we write vnto
a third, we muſt praye him to
admoniſh our enemie to holde his
peace, and ſhall excuſe our ſelues,
ſaying that we would not haue
him offended, although we haue
ſpokē yll of our enimie, for it hath
not ben for malice or yll will, but
onely for to cauſe his malice and
ill report to ceaſe.
            
            
               
               The Example: wherein Catilina
purgeth himſelfe to the Senate
of Rome, for the cryme of
coniuration impoſed
againſt him by
Cicero.
               IT is always my cuſtome & condition
(Notable Lordes and Fathers) to flée
wicked detractours, and to haue in great
horrour the diff
                     •
                  mers, who like wolues
rauiſh the good renowne of good people:
and there is nothing that ſéemeth vnto
me more deteſtable, more diſhoneſt, nor
more abhominable, than in the abſence
of a man to dilacerate and teare in péeces
his honour: and againſt them doe I
manfully fight, this notwithſtanding, I
can not hinder their Serpentyne & Viperous
tonges, from committing ſuch
iniuries. In number of whom, and of my
flatterers, is this wicked enuious ſerpē
                  tyne
Cicero, enimie to God & good men,
and to the publike weale, who inceſſantly
inuenteth new dreames againſt mée.
I haue refrayned aſmuch as I could to

aunſwer vnto his ſclanderous lyes, bycauſe
I would not be noted as he is, to
be a babler, and of diſhoneſt language.
And bycauſe that from day to day his venom
encreaſeth & is vomited out from yl
vnto worſe, vnder your corrections my
Lords, & in your preſēce, I haue thought
good to diſcharge me of two labours.
The one to aunſwer vnto him, and to
purge my ſelfe of the crimes by him falſly
impoſed againſt me: and the other to
giue you to vnderſtand and to declare
vnto you, his execrable maners, vices, &
curſed conditions, to the ende that you
might heare and vnderſtād his deceitfull
and crafty enuies, & not giue credit vnto
his words. This wicked enuiour and ſeducer
of the whole publike weale, ſayth
euery where that I, who (with out boaſting
my ſelfe) am loyall, haue conſpired
againſt my cuntrey and publike weale:
this wicked ſtranger and ſower of all
ſedition crieth againſt me, who am a patron
and member of the common weale,
that I would deſtroy it, euen as though
the members ſhould deſtroy the body: is

it credible? ought a mā to beleue it? And
neuertheleſſe he publiſheth it as though
it were true. I woulde faine know by
what coniectures, or by what ſignes, he
could perceiue it, if he would not ſay that
he had dremed it. But this wicked perſō
turneth ſuch lyke & other euils as are in
him, vpon me. Certes my lords, he is ſo
ſtuffed with iniquities, ye he muſt néedes
burſt & vomit out his poyſon. He neuer
did good in this Citie, he neuer loued
any, but day by daye he ſpyeth how he
may worke diſpleaſure and damage to
ſome good mā or other. Take héede therfore
how you giue credit to this wicked
& damnable man: It is not yet long ago
ſince he came into this Citie his féete all
duſty, & vnder colour of vanitie, and of a
litle Rethorike that he hath, & which he
vſeth, he hath conuerted a great quantitie
of poore people, whom he hath by his
arte, fraude and deceyt deſpoyled of their
goods, and by that meanes is growne vp
to great ryches. Which way ſhold there
haue come vnto him ſo many houſes, peſſeſſions,
ſeruants, & ſo lightly as he hath

them, had he not ſpoyled and robbed the
poore people? But by this vnrighteouſneſſe
and riches he is become ſo proude,
that he which is but newly come, wolde
chaſe me out of my Citie, and deſtroy
me. And of him ſurely I could ſay innumerable
euils, were it permitted me to
ſpeake fréely, and that I douted not to
diſpleaſe you. For many tymes it doth
good men more hurt to heare recyted the
euill of an other, than it doeth this other
himſelfe, he being euil & wicked. Therefore
pleaſeth it you of your grace, to deliuer
your poore Citizen and Burgeſſe,
from the falſe throte of this curſed Serpent.
            
            
               How to write inuectiue Epiſtles
of contention, rerehending
another for ignorance
in ſtudie.
               EPiſtles and letters Inuectiue
of contention & diſpraiſe, muſt
be deuided into three partes. But
in this caſe there are two ways,

either to write vnto him whome
we mynde to reprehend: or elſe
better, to write vnto a third perſon,
as iudge, or arbitratour. Firſt
to declare that it is not our vſe to
moue cōtrouerſie, for we demand
nothing but peace. Ye and although
that we be oftentimes iniured
by our enimies, & that they
ſay all the worſt that they can,
yet neuertheleſſe we would giue
to vnderſtand that the inſolencie
of our aduerſaries is ſo preſumptuous,
and ſo tending to deſtroie
our eſtimation, that we can not
any longer kepe ſylence, but haue
thought good to write, to the end
that he might be iudge. Secondly,
to expreſſe briefly and plainely
wherevpon the controuerſie
dependeth, afterwardes to recite
our reaſons, and to cōfirme them,
and to confute thoſe of our aduerſary.

Thirdly, that we might ſay
many other things, whereof we
wil kepe ſylence, to the ende that
we would not be thought to procede
ratherby enuie, thā to ſpeake
the truth: prayīg & beſeching him
vnto whom we write, to iudge of
the ignorāce of our aduerſary, recōmending
our ſelues vnto him.
            
            
               The Example: wherein a certain Barber
writeth to a Doctor of Phyſick,
concerning his aduerſary a Chirurgian.
               THere was neuer thing more deteſtable
vnto me, nor which I had more
in horrour (worſhipfull Doctor) than to
ſee a man reioyce in detractions, and euil
reportes of an other, for thereby are
wicked people knowne. And although I
haue diuers times of many ben iniured,
fl
                     •
                  uted, ſkorned, & diſpraiſed, reporting
by me a thouſand dreames and lyes, yet
haue I always ſuffred them, & turned ye
deafe eare towards them. And now ſteppeth
forth a new detracter of me, who by
force conſtraineth me to anſwere, and to

defende me againſt his curſed ſclaūder,
for the ſauegard of my eſtimation, which
he thinketh to deſtroy. And to the ende
that I be not accounted ſo ignorant as
hée, I haue thought good to write vnto
you, for to giue you to vnderſtand that
he offreth me euident wroug. This wicked
and ignorant Aſſe crieth and publiſheth
euery where that it appertaineth
not to any man liuing, to meddle with
curing of a wound, or vlcer, within the
citie, except he be a Chirurgiā, & ſworne
to the Citie, at the leaſt, if the Chirurgian
be not preſent and aſſiſtant to ſée the
whole cure: but behold his crafte, & how
couertly he wold take away the practiſe
gaine, & profit of ye Barbers. Who is he
ſo ignorant that knoweth not yt always
hereto fore the maſter Barbers haue accuſtomed
to cure all kynde of woundes
aſwel olde as new? Who is it yt is ſo ignorāt
of the notable & good cures yt they
haue accuſtomed to doe? wherefore then
ſhoulde they not vſe to doe as they haue
done, without borowing leaue of the
gentlemē Chirurgians? ſeing that they

doe and haue done their cures very well
without their aſſiſtance. I would that
the ignorant Aſſehed ſhould know, that
that which we doe is better done, & that
we vnderſtand better the arte of Chirurgery
than he doeth, or a great multitude
of Aſſes that call them ſelues Chyrurgians,
who haue not the knowledge
to apply one only inſtrument, or to make
one incyſion right, but all their caſe is
nothing elſe but ſophiſticall arguments,
which ſerue to no purpoſe. Therfore it
is neceſſary that it come to the handy
operacion of the Barbers, who vnderſtand
Chirurgerie aſwel as they: together
alſo that it would be greate coſte
for the poore pacients, to pay bothe the
Barber and the Chirurgian. Secondly,
and if I would, I could write vnto you
more amply of his enuies and ignorant
detractions, but I loue rather to holde
my peace, to the ende that it be not ſayde
that I ſpeake more againſt him of enuie
than to ſpeakethe playne truth. Therefore
you that know the whole, ought to
iudge the equitie, and to cauſe him to

kéepe ſilence in this matter: wherof I
alwayes recommende mée vnto you,
wholy offering my ſelfe. &c.
            
            
               Hovve to vvrite a Defenſe in
a Contention.
               WHen we are accuſed and reprehended
by contempt and
diſpraiſe, we may defend our ſelues
by letters or epiſtles, which
muſt contayne .iij. parts. Firſt, to
declare, that we are prouoked to
aunſwer vnto him that writeth
euil of vs, and that it is not our
cuſtome to take altercation, eſpecially
of wicked and ignorāt people:
And were it not for that it
would ſeeme that we accorded to
that which he ſayth, we woulde
not voucheſafe to aunſwere vnto
their ignorance. Afterward muſt
be declared by maner of recitall,
the reaſons of the aduerſarie, confuting

them to oure poſſibilitie.
Secondly, we muſt ſhewe by oppoſite,
ſome faults and ignorāces
of our aduerſarie, which ſhall be
manifeſt and apparaunt by liuely
reaſons. Thirdly, to ſay, that although
we coulde expreſſe many
moe imbecillities and faultes in
him, yet neuertheleſſe we wil not
declare them, to the ende that it apeare
not that we ſpeake againſt
him rather through enuie, thā for
the truths ſake: ſaying that we
would that hee vnto whome we
write, ſhould be the iuſt Iudge of
the matters.
            
            
               The example: wherin the Chirurgian
defendeth himſelfe to the Phyſitian
againſt his aduerſarie
the Barber.
               I Am aduertiſed (equall Iudge) to bée
accuſed before you on the behalfe of
ſuche a one, a boaſting Barber, who

not only is ignorant in his ſcience, but
alſo in all that a wyſe man oughte to
know: and I am ſory that it behoueth
me to anſwer him, but that which moueth
me, is to the ende that it bée not
thought that I conſente to his errour,
and to purge my ſelfe before you, that
know and vnderſtand al things: and to
the end that expulſing his olde iniuries,
I might ſet ſilence to his newe. Fyrſt,
for that he ſayeth, that euer heretofore
the Barbers haue accuſtomed to cure
woundes, as wel old as new, and therto
hath ſet forth their goodly cures: Behold
& conſider the craft & ſubtiltie, how
gloriouſly he boaſteth & vaunteth hymſelf,
and riſeth vp to ſuppreſſe and ouerthrow
the whole arte & facultie of Chirurgerie
Is it not wel inough vnderſtood
and knowne, what peril there is in thinking
to heale al diſeaſes? & that to make
a good operation in ſuche & other difficile
matters, it is needefull that the cauſe be
wel vnderſtāded & debated: & to knowe
whether that that which is to be cured
be a ſimple woūd, an vlcer, or a fiſtule,

which is the peccant matter, and what
ointement or other medicine is proper
for it: and to diſcerne and vnderſtande
this thing rightly, what Barber is it (I
meane to ſpeake of vnſkilfull) that vnderſtandeth
one onely worde of Latin,
and with muche a doe ſcarſe good Engliſh?
I knowe very fewe that can expounde
the difference betwéene Leporam,
and Lepram, And yet notwithſtā
                  ding
moſt of their Chirurgerie bookes are
ſtuffed full of Eloquent Latin, and that
difficile, yea and the moſt parte of our
Engliſhe termes, are very farre different
from our vulgare and maternall
ſpeache, in ſuch ſort, that who ſo fully
vnderſtandeth not the Latine tongue,
yea and alſo the Greke, can ſcarſe vnderſtande
them. Through which error
ariſe many times ſundry inconueniences.
For the aſſes that are, of all diſeaſes
make the Pocke. And this commeth
to paſſe, bicauſe they will neuer call for
the Chirurgian, who in his facultie, is
of all men approued, ſkilfull, learned &
very experte, to know howe to diſcern
                     •
                  
                  
and vnderſtande all the pointes of his
Arte, without erring or making fault:
and contrarily ſuche ignoraunt which
darkely giue credite to their glorious
heades, and haue no reaſon ſaue onely
their propre will and fooliſhe opinion,
and whiche of a deceiptfull argument,
make a neceſſary demonſtration, doe
giue by their daungerous promiſes, a
very fallible hope, diſalowing all good
writings, if they bée not conformable
to their opinion. Therfore (ſay I) that
he ought to be put to perpetuall ſilence.
Secondly, thus muche ſhall ſuffiſe you,
although I might ſay more, but his ignorance
can not beare it: For it is knowen
to euery one, that thorough their
fault they haue committed a thouſande
euills, and ſay that they may better kill
an hundreth men, thā an other to heale
one onely: and therefore take héede of
them who maye. Furthermore, I will
holde my peace, for it is no great honor
to write the imperfections and ignorā
                  ces
that might be tolde, yea & if I ſhould
ſay more, it wold be ſayd, that I ſpeke

more of malice and yll will, than to open
the truth. Thirdly, although I yet
kéepe backe many other things, if tyme
and place ſcrued: and although he ſhall
meddle to ſpeake more of mée, yet ſir,
you may iudge of the whole: for you
know wel what part beareth ignorāce
and innocencie. Wholly offeryng my
humble ſeruice to you and yours. &c.
            
            
               Howe to write Domeſtical and familiar
Letters or Epiſtles.
               DOmeſtical or houſhold letters
are more in vſe than any other
forſomuch as of their nature they
are very neceſſary, to let our frendes
vnderſtande of our eſtate, and
of our buſineſſe, be it of helth, proſperitie,
ſickneſſe, aduerſitie, or any
other domeſticall and familiar
thyngs: and in ſuch matters the
Letters or Epiſtles muſt be deuided
into thre partes. If we write

of our owne eſtate, health or ſickneſſe,
or of the healthe or ſickeneſſe
of an other. Firſt following
Tullie, and others, we may (as
they do) adde the Latin ſentence,
Si vales, bene eſt, ego quidem valeo, If
you be in good helth, god be praiſed
for it, for thanks be to God I
am. Secondely, wee ſhall recite
our owne health, or the cauſes of
the amendment thereof, and alſo
the helth or ſickneſſe of our frend,
whiche we ſhall eſteme euen as
our owne, gladde of his recouerie
or proſperitie, rendring thankes
vnto god, who hath ſo diſpoſed it:
& likewiſe if there be hapned vnto
vs any fortune or miſfortune,
we ſhall write the ſtate therof, be
it riches or pouertie, dignitie, or
depreſſion, to admonyſhe oure
friende either to reioyce or ſorow
with vs.
               
                  
Thirdly, we ſay cōmonly: Thus,
not hauing wherewith further to
enlarge at this preſent, but beſeeching
the Lorde to keepe and preſerue
you in his holy tuition: we
finiſh. From ſuch a place. &c. By
yours altogither to command. &c.
or otherwiſe, as ſhal pleaſe the enditer.
            
            
               The Example: of a common Style
in that caſe.
               IF you be in health and mery, I am very
glad, for great thanks to be giuen to
God on my behalfe, I fynde my ſelfe in
very good health and welfare. You do
peraduenture greatly maruell, for that
I was wont to write often vnto you, &
of late haue deferred ſo to do, wherof it
may be that you woulde accuſe me of
negligence: howebeit it hath not bene
through negligence, for an ague hath ſo
weakened me of late, that I had ſmall
hope to haue eſcaped without treading

the trace out of this worlde into another,
yea I was brought ſo low, that euen
the Phyſitions had quite giuen me
ouer, and I had no hope ſaue onely in
God, to whoſe good aide I ſtill committed
my ſelfe. Secondly, his ſoueraigne
bountie hath brought me to my former
helth, notwithſtanding it hath not ben
without great expenſe of money: Beholde
therefore the cauſes why I coulde
not write vnto you, but frō henceforth
I will write vnto you more oftener, if
God grant me time and ſpace ſo to do.
Thirdly, I ſhall deſire you to write vnto
me of your proſperitie, and of ſuch a
one, aſſuring you, that if there be any
thing that I may do for you, do but cō
                  maund
me and I will do myne indeuor
to accompliſh it, God to frende, whome
I beſech to graunt vnto you your harts
deſire. From ſuch a place. &c.
            
            
               How to write other domeſtical Letters
of familiar buſineſſe.
               WE muſt deuide thē into thre
partes. Firſt, & Secondly,

as in the other going before.
Thirdly, ſhal be put the concluſion,
ſaying that we haue thought
good to aduertiſe hym of ſuche
buſineſſe, bycauſe hee is oure very
friende.
            
            
               The Example: wherin one Friend aduertiſeth
an other of the proceſſe
that he hath wonne.
               IF it bée well with you (my ſingular
friende) then is it very wel with me:
For euen as I am (God be praiſed) in
good health, ſo woulde I deſire that it
ſhoulde be lykewiſe with you. And bicauſe
I know that the loue betwixt vs
two, hath alwayes made vs equall in
our fortunes, therefore haue I thought
good to write vnto you, of my buſineſſe
and affaires, bicauſe in déede you might
be the more ioyfull. Secondly, you are
aduiſed of the time, trouble & coſt that
I was at in the ſute that I had againſt

ſuch a one, and how oftē I haue curſed
the houre whenſoeuer I heard talke of
it, euen ready many tymes to gyue it
quite ouer: Yet neuertheleſſe by trauel
and diligence, and by importunate
ſute, my good right, vpon Tuiſday laſt,
(notwithſtanding any clamor that my
aduerſarie made (to his greate confuſion)
I obteined ſentence to my profite,
wherof I render immortall thankes to
Almighty God. Thirdly, I know well
that of my profite, honour, and ioy, you
are as ioyfull as my ſelfe: and ſéeing
that my aduerſities do bryng you deſolation,
it is good reaſon, that my proſperities
ſhould bring you conſolation.
Therfore I pray you do it to vnderſtāde
to all our friends there, to the ende that
they may participate of oure ioy. And
if there be any thing that it will pleaſe
you to commaunde me, be you well aſſured,
that of me you ſhall haue an infallible
friende. And thus end I at this
preſent, beſéeching our Lorde. &c.
            
            
               
               How to viſit our Frend with Letters,
not hauing any great matter
to write.
               OFten times it chaunceth that
we haue no matter to write to
our frend, & yet we would gladly
viſit him with our Letters, ſpeaking
of him or of his buſineſſe: &
ſuch Letters muſt containe three
partes. Firſt, to get boneuolence
on our owne behalfe, ſaying that
bicauſe we loue him, we thought
it good to write vnto him, and to
recreate him, by communicating
vnto hym our Letters, to the end
that we may take pleſure, in that
which he ſhall write vnto vs again,
cōſidering that there is nothing
more appropriate vnto frē
                  des,
than often to write to & fro.
Secōdly we ſhal ſay that we are
in health and good eſtate, deſiring

to know of his helth and proſperitie:
praying vnto God to keepe
and preſerue him from all euill.
Thirdly we ſhal deſire him to viſit
vs often with his Letters, to
this end, that hering of his helth
& proſperitie, we may haue cauſe
of conſolation, offring our ſelues
&c.
            
            
               The Example of the Style
in that caſe.
               ALthough I haue no mater to write
vnto you (my deare friend) for that
I knowe not of any newes hereabouts
chaunced, yet neuertheleſſe the greate
loue equall betwixt vs, will not ſuffer
me to lette paſſe any meſſanger that I
know goeth towards you, without ſending
you Letters by him, for I beleue
verily that you haue as great ioy to rede
my Letters, as I haue to reade yours.
Secondly (my friend) you ſhall vnderſtand
that I and all my familie are (god

be praiſed) in good health, earneſtly deſiring
to know of your proſperitie, and
howe all our frendes thereaboutes doe.
For I aſſure you there is nothing vnto
vs more pleaſant, ioyfull, nor agreable,
than to vnderſtande of your health, good
fortune, and proſperitie: but this cauſeth
loue (my frende,) bicauſe that from
the time of our youth, we haue ben ioyned
together with that bande. And therfore
my deare and perfect friend, I earneſtly
requeſt you, that it would pleaſe
you to viſite me often with your Letters,
to the ende that notwithſtanding
the diſtaunce of the place betwixte vs,
our mindes may yet reioyce, & be comforted
together, praying you with all
my heart to commaund me in your affaires,
euē as he that is always ready to
do you ſeruice, God to frend, to whō. &c.
            
            
               How to write of ſome ſmall affaires,
buſineſſe or newes.
               HAuing a matter of great importaunce
to write, yet many

times we ar deſirous to write of
ſom ſmal buſineſſe or newes of litle
importāce, & ſo doing ye letters
muſt cōtain .iij. parts. Firſt to declare
the cauſe that moueth vs,
as in the ſtile before. Secondly, to
ſalute him gētly, telling ſome pretie
& mery newes. Thirdly, to offer
him our ſeruice, with hartie cō
                  mendations
vnto him, & others.
            
            
               The example: wherin one friende
vvriteth to an other of certain
ſmall newes.
               ALthough it bée long ſince I wrote
vnto you (right dere & perfect frend)
yet is is it not for ye I had forgotten you,
but bycauſe I had not any matter to
write vnto you: & therfore hauing now
found a truſtie Meſſanger, I haue thought
good to write vnto you theſe Letters,
whereby you might vnderſtand, ye
god be praiſed (who diſpoſeth al things)
we are here in good helth, beſeching him
yt it be ſo wt you, & all our frends there.

I haue bethought me & conſidered with
my ſelfe, whereof I might write vnto
you, and haue founde none other thing,
ſaue onely to certifie you that by the cō
                  maundement
of the King and the ordinance
of the Court, this day was made
a great generall Iuſtice, which was a
wonderfull excellent thing to beholde,
conſidering the order that there was
kept: you haue heretofore ſéene but
I thincke not ſo paſſingly well handled
nor better ordred, for ſurely the chalengers
eſpecially with ſo valiant corage
and ſtrength enforced themſelues
in the Iuſtice, that wonder it was to
ſée: and on the contrary ſide appeared
alſo ſuch manly hearts and boldned ſtomacks,
that great commendations obtayned
both partes of all the aſſiſtants:
but yet in fine (after many ſturdie ſtrokes
on both ſides) the chalengers woon
the price. &c. Thirdly, if I had knowen
any other newes, I would haue written
them vnto you, praying you that
you will ſtill beare me good wil and often
times write vnto me: Recommending

me eſpecially to you, and to ſuch a
one, and to all our other frendes thereaboutes.
Beſeching our Lord to ſend you
comfort and health &c.
            
            
               How to write letters contayning
ſome pleaſant Ieſtes of oure
ſelues, beſydes other
matter.
               THere are yet other ſortes of
letters: for theſe before written,
may be called ſimple: now
teſteth there to expreſſe the compoſition
of ſome mixed Letters,
which are of two or moe things.
And firſt we wil ſhew the ſtyle of
a mery letter prouoking to laughter
or reioycing: yea and it oftentymes
falleth that in weightye
matters, there is to be mingleh
ſome pretie cōceate, be it through
ieſting of our ſelues, or of ſome
other. And ſuch Letters muſt be

deuided into three partes. Firſt,
we muſt pleaſantly expreſſe the
mery ieſtes or conceyte that we
entend to vtter (our honeſty and
reputation ſtill obſerued) for that
which we write is only to reioice
our frend. Secondly, to leaue the
ieſt or mery cōceit, & to change into
ſome other matter, to the ende
that it be not ſayd, that we be altogether
ſcoffers. Thirdly, to offer
our whole ſeruice, as in the letters
before.
            
            
               The Example: wherin a Souldier
writeth to his Captayne.
               IT is no maruell (redouted Captayne)
though you make great account of me
for if I ſhold be in any réencōter againſt
our enimies, where it were neceſſary to
part it with blowes, you ſhould ſée how
I would handle my ſelfe, yea the grat

feare that I haue of it, doeth make me
already trouble and quake, conſidering
ye I neuer fought but vnder the curtaine,
and with the pot and the ſpiggot: I beleue
I durſt not aſſault the ſnayle, if ſhe
were armed with hir ſhell and hornes,
for as hardy a felow am I as euer was
drawne out of a boweaſe: yea in ſuch
a matter I woulde loue well the ſound
of the retraicte: and if euer you ſawe
man of warre play better with a two
footed ſwoord, then ſay boldly that I am a
lyar, for I would runne with the formoſt
to the forewarde of a good Tauerue,
there to giue the onſet. Secondly (my
Captayne) all this I haue written but
onely in ieſt. For in déede to ſaye the
truth (none diſprayſed) there is no man
in the whole companie, that more willingly
or more coragiouſly woulde aduenture
himſelfe in the battayle than I
woulde doe. For by the faythe that
I owe vnto the King and to you, I
haue ſo much before mine eyes the publike
weale, and haue ſo much pitie of

the miſery and calamytie of the poore
people, that at all houres, both day and
night, I am purpoſed to hazard my life
in the defending thereof, and repulſing
of the enimies, to the ende that folowing
the ſteps of other valiant Champions,
I may purchaſe honor & renowne.
Thirdly, neuertheleſſe (valiāt Captain)
I pray you not to put your ſelfe in danger
without a cauſe, but if you ſée that
it be nedefull either for your owne defenſe,
or otherwiſe, you ſhall fynd in me
ſuch facts, as I wil not vtter with mouth
always preſt and redy to obey your good
pleaſure and commaundement.
            
            
               How to write Letters concerning
mery ieſtes or taunts by
ſome other.
               IF we would merily taunt him
vnto whome we write, or ſome
other of whom we write, it muſt
be done euen as in the ſtyle before
written, ſauing that in the ſecond

part we muſt erneſtly cōtinue on
the matter.
            
            
               The example: wherin Cicero ieſteth
with Valerius.
               COnſidering with my ſelfe at this preſent,
(my perfect frends Valerius) the
great negligence that is in you, & that
ſynce your departure you haue written
nothing vnto me, I can not excuſe you,
but to ſay that you haue the palſey or
elſe the ſeuer lurden, and that the hands
which were wont to write often vnto
me, can now no longer holde the penne.
If it be ſo, recommend your ſelfe to the
Saints of Paradiſe, or if not, learne ſo
write with your féete, euen as you haue
well done with your handes. Secondly,
although ieſting & bourding, yet knowe
I not any other thing which might be
more gratefull vnto me, or wherin you
might doe me more pleaſure, than now
amongſt the great affaires that I haue
for the publike weale, to giue me ſome
conſolation by your letters, to the ende

that I may be certayne of your health:
You know my heart how I loue you, &
doe not requeſt any other thing of you
at this preſent, if not that it wold pleaſe
you to write often vnto me. Thirdly, as
for me, if there be any thing wherein I
may imploye my ſelfe to pleaſure you,
you may command me, euen as him ye is
gladly redy to accōpliſh your good deſyre.
            
            
               How to write letters giuing generall
commiſsion and charge of buſineſſe
or affayres.
               THere is yet another fort of letters,
whereby we giue commiſſion
or charge of certayne buſineſſe
generally or particularly,
and ſuch letters muſt contayne
foure partes. Firſt, to purchaſe
his beneuolence, ſaying, that for
the loyaltie that is in him, and alſo
the confidence that we haue of
his perſon, and that for the loue

of vs he wil entreat our buſineſſe
euen as his owne, therefore haue
we deliberated to commit our buſyneſſe
vnto him. Secondly, to
declare what buſineſſe, and with
what perſons, and how he hath
to doe. Thirdly, to expreſſe the
authoritie that we minde to giue
him ouer our buſyneſſe, with all
other clauſes neceſſary to the expedicion
or execucion of the ſame
buſineſſe. Fourthly, to promiſe to
take in good parte, whatſoeuer
to him ſhalbe done &c.
            
            
               The Example: wherein Cicero committeth
to Scipio his authoritie
ouer all his buſineſſe
in Rome.
               I Know not any thing ſo weighty or
ſo di
                     ••
                  icill, (my more than dere frend

                  Scipio) yea though death it ſelfe ſhould
follow, that for you I would not moſt
willingly doe. For ſo willeth the loue &
beneuolence that inwardly ioyneth and
vniteth vs together: and I doe ſtedfaſtly
beleue, that you wil do the like for me,
whenſoeuer I néede. Secondly, the cauſe
that moueth me to write thus vnto you,
is ye I haue much buſineſſe to diſpatch
at Rome, where perſonally (for my other
affayres, I can not be aſſiſtant, & therefore
it behoueth me to haue ſome frende
reſydent there for me, that may take the
charge of my affayres. Thirdly, and although
that I could commit them to dyuers
other my frendes, yet notwithſtanding
I am affrayde in ſo doing, that I
ſhould to much offende you: and ſhould
ſéeme that I would wholly ſeparate my
ſelfe from you, if I ſhold not commit my
cauſes and affaires vnto you: and lykewiſe
if you deſiſt from giuing me commiſſion
of yours, our naturall and mutuall
loue might be diminiſhed. Which
caſe to auoyde, I now ſende you playne
and eſpeciall procuration, in my vrgent

and nedefull buſineſſe: hauing ſtedfaſt
confidence in you that nothing ſhall periſh
through negligence. And eſpecially
concerning the cauſe and purſuyte betwene
me and ſuch a one, wherof I pray
you, procure ſpéedy expedition, as knowing
well the great wrong of the aduerſe
partie, & my good right, which hath great
néede of ayde and ſuccour. Fourthly,
I beſech you againe to haue my affaires
in remembrance, whereof I giue you the
charge and playne commiſſion irreuocable:
all which things I would haue you
to do and procure, euen as though I my
ſelfe were perſonally preſent, and whatſoeuer
you ſhall doe I promiſe to be content
withall, vnder obligation and bond
of all my goods, according as more plainly
is conteined in the procuration (or
Letter of attorney, which I ſende you
here withall. And thus fyniſh I my letter,
praying. &c.
            
            
               How to write letters, giuing particular
Commiſsion for ſome affayres.
               OFtentimes yt happeneth that
we commit, and giue charge

of ſome particular buſyneſſe: and
ſuch letters muſt be diuided into
foure parts, euen as the other before
written. Howbeit in the ſecond
part we muſt expreſſe one or
moe buſineſſe and affayres by order,
in euery article, the things
that we would haue diſpatched
being particularly ſhewed, plainly
and manifeſtly.
            
            
               The Example: wherein Appius
conſtituteth Cicero his receyuer
in Sicilia.
               THe perfectneſſe of fidelitie that I
haue in you, (my loyall friende Tully,)
and the which you vſe towardes
all your frendes, as I haue alwayes
perfectly perceyued it, doeth giue me
no ſmall hope, (together the loue and
beneuolence wherwith we are vnyted)
that your wyſedome and liberall humanytie,
taketh great pleaſure to employ
it ſelfe aboute my buſyneſſe, if I commit
any vnto you. Secondly, and to

the ende that I giue you to vnderſtand,
what buſineſſe I intend that you doe
for me at this preſent, you ſhall know
and vnderſtand, that in your prouince
I haue hadde to doe for the Senate of
Rome and that great ſummes of money
remayne due vnto me by dyuers of my
creaditours thereaboutes. And ſeing
that I am at this poynt aſſured of the
good will that you beare vnto mée, I
haue thought good to conſtitute you my
procurour or attourney, to receyue of
ſuch a one, ſo much: and of ſuch a one,
ſo much. &c. Whereof I ſende you the
cedules and obligations. Thirdly, and
if any of them or any other wyll reſyſt
you, and refuſe or delay the payment,
I gyue you power and aucthoritie to
conſtrayne them by all wayes of Iuſtice,
euen as I might my ſelfe, if I
were there perſonally preſent. Fourthly,
whatſoeuer you ſhall doe for me,
I promiſe you to be content therewithall,
& bynd me by the procuration which
I ſēd you by this bearer, with ye billes &
writings ſeruing to that effect. I commit

the whole vnto you, certefiyng you that
in me you haue a frend preſt and ready
to do whatſoeuer you ſhall commaunde
him. From Rome the. &c.
            
            
               How to write certaine myxed
Letters.
               YEt is there another ſorte of
Letters conteyning entermixed
matters, whiche are to be deuided
into two parts onely. Firſt,
to declare the moſt neceſſary buſineſſe.
Neuertheleſſe we muſt always
begin with ſome honeſt
preamble, lyke as if we write to
our frende, ſaying though we bee
occupied and buſyed with many
affayres, yet we intend to viſit
him with our letters. Secondly,
to declare particularly and plainly
our intent. And if peraduēture
it behoue vs to aunſwere letters
receiued from our frende, in ſuch

a caſe for the preamble we ſhall
ſay that we haue receiued his letters,
the which were very comfortable
vnto vs, and that we intend
orderly to giue aunſwere: in
the ende whereof we may wryte
that which we will beſyde, offering
as in the other before. &c.
            
            
               The Example: wherein Cicero
writeth to Curio concerning
his buſineſſe.
               I Haue by this bearer receued your letters
(my ſingular frende Curio) wherby
I greatly reioyced whē I vnderſtoode
the good health & proſperitie that is with
you and yours: yet notwithſtanding I
was ſomething ſory when I ſawe my
ſelfe accuſed of negligence, for that I
haue not written vnto you ſo often as
you deſired & as I ought to haue done.
And certainly I cōfeſſe that I am greatly
to be blamed, for in deede I was not
very much buſyed, and am very glad

that I know that my letters do ſo greatly
comfort you: promiſing you that from
henceforth there ſhal paſſe no meſſāger,
but I will viſit you with my writings,
and will neuer thinke it any labour to
write vnto you, ſo long as I may pleaſure
you. Secondly, you write vnto me
that I ſhould certifie you of your buſyneſſe,
in what ſtate they are: I aſſure
you that day and night I go about to diſpatch
them, but the craftineſſe of your
aduerſaries is ſo great, that I am forced
to deferre, attending the good houre to
breake and fruſtrate their malyce, the
which notwithſtanding; I beſeche God
to mayntaine you in your honour and
dignitie. And where as you will me to
ſende you my bookes of the lawe, I
would gladly doe it, but for the occaſion
of theſe troubleſome tymes, I thinke it
néedeful to tary til things be more peaceable,
and than will I ſatiſfie that which
you deſyre, that is to ſay, you to commaunde,
and I to obey. &c.
            
            
               
               Hovve to vvrite Letters conteyning
diuerſe and ſundry
matters.
               LEtters conteining many ſorts
of matters may be deuided into
aſmany parts as they cōtaine
ſundry matters: and we muſt begin
with the moſt principal part,
alwayes obſeruing the rules before
written, and afterward the
moſt neceſſary, and ſo conſequently
euen vnto the ende, ſo that the
whole be finiſhed in order & by articles:
howbeit it is good to place
in the beginning ſome preamble
fyt for the matter: and fynally to
offer as before. Note alſo, that
if there be queſtion bothe of our
frendes affayres and our owne,
then is it decent to begin wyth
thoſe of our frendes, and afterwardes

to ſpeake of our owne,
thereby to giue him to vnderſtād
that we haue his affaires aſmuch
or more in remembraunce
than our owne.
            
            
               The example, wherein Tully writeth
to Pompilius of comforting,
graue and domeſtical
matters.
               I Vnderſtande (my very perfect frende
Pompilius) by Letters receyued from
ſome of our frendes, that your valyant
Father is deceaſſed out of this world: &
this know ye, that in as much as we are
firmely ioyned together in frendeſhip,
therfore it is very heuy for me to ſuffer,
yea I eſteme it euen as myne owne aduerſitie,
as frends ought to do. But whē
I conſider how well borne he was, and
that he came in maryage with noble and
ſage parents, & by his vertues got ſuch
dignities and authorities as can not be
recyted: yea and moreouer (which is almoſt
impoſſible) that he was alwayes

in fauour both with the Lords and the
people, that he hath runne his courſe
of nature, and that he is godly departed,
I finde no cauſe to lamēt, but with
all my heart to render thanks vnto god,
that hath giuen him ſo many giftes of
vertue in this worlde, and then after
many yeares, hath called him frō darkneſſe
to his cleare light. Secondly, let
vs now ſpeake of other matters: you
ſhall vnderſtande that it is reported vs
euen to the whole Senate, yt the french
men prepare a great hoſt againſt oure
common weale, and haue alreadie ouer
runne our fields, therefore is it condeſcended,
that manfully and with a good
courage we ſhall go againſt them. And
this to doe is eſtabliſhed by Pompeius,
who in wiſedome, counſell, and warfare
authoritie, hath none like vnto him
for to conduct oure armie. Therefore I
counſell you to leaue Cumane, and to
come into this Citie, duryng the expedition
of this warre, for to auoyde the
hurt that might come vnto you. Thirdly,
you write vnto me that I ſhould receyue

money of youre detters, I wyll
doe it willingly: But during this tumulte,
I determyne nothyng in the
Senate, nor elſewhere, vntyll that
thyngs bée more quiete: and I dare
boldely write vnto you, that yf you
come hither, you may get honour and
profite: and you ſhall ſée what dylygence
I haue vſed towardes your creditours,
and to magnifie youre name:
aſſuring you that I am wholly at your
commandement.
            
            
               How a Prince faithfully certifieth
the vvorthie qualities
of a man.
               ALl, or moſte parte of the ſtyles
before written, are addreſſed
eyther to oure ſuperiours, equalles,
or inferiours, whiche mighte
ſeeme to ſuffiſe for thys lyttle
woorke: yet neuertheleſſe, bycauſe
I woulde haue the gentle

Readers, to vnderſtande that
I delyte to expreſſe aboundance
of Stiles, I haue thought good
to recite ſome ſtiles, whiche writers
and learned men haue accuſtomed
to vſe, following therein
the example of diuers good Orators.
And the firſt ſtile ſhall be a
letter of fidelitie, to wit, VVhen a
Prince writeth to one or to many
the veritie and truth of a thing, euen
as it is, giuing perfect notice
that it is ſo: and ſuch letters muſt
containe three partes. Fyrſt, the
Prince putteth his name, his title,
and other qualities agreable
to hys hyghneſſe. Secondely,
muſte bee placed the diſcourſe or
entraunce fitte for the purpoſe,
whereof wee intende to write.
Thirdely, to purchaſe beneuolence
to the thing, or to the perſon
wherof we write, cauſyng credite

to be giuen thervnto: expreſſing
the very truth of that which we
commende, or the vertues of the
perſon.
            
            
               The Example: wherein the Duke of
Ʋenice certifieth the vviſedom
and ſcience of G. A.
               
                  AVguſtine, by the grace of God. &c.
To all them that ſhall ſee theſe letters,
helth and comfort. Secondly, the
Maieſtie of a Prince, & his magnificall
authoritie is not onely to puniſhe & correcte
vices, but with his whole power
he ought to deiect & chaſe away all vicious
perſons: and euē ſo likewiſe ought
he of Iuſtice and honeſtie, the good and
vertuous, full of Sapience and ſtudie,
not onely to amplifie with goodes and
honour, but alſo in all thyngs to gyue
them ſupport, fauor and praiſe. Thirdly,
and for that it is many yeares agoe
ſince we haue perfectely knowne Georges
Alexander Doctor very experte and
ſkilfull, as well in the Greke as in the

Latine tongue, yea loued, eſtéemed and
honoured of all men, for the grauitie of
his eloquence: wherfore beſides the benefites
that we haue ſhewed him, it is
yet our minde, that by our faithful witneſſe,
the vertues whiche are in him,
ſhould be knowne vnto all men, and by
your relation to be magnified. And therfore
we recommende vnto you the ſayde
Georges Alexander, in al his affaires: for
that citie or towne, may thinke it ſelfe
very happie, wherein he ſhall vouchſafe
to abide, for the excellent doctrine that
is in him. And if there be any ſeruice or
pleſure done vnto him for our ſake, we
eſtéeme it euen as if it were done vnto
our ſelf, and for the ſame will giue perpetuall
thankes. In witneſſe whereof
wée haue ſealed this with oure Seale
manuell. Youen here the ſuch a day &c.
            
            
               How a great prince writeth of
peace or warres &c.
               THere is an other ſort of letters
when a great Prince writeth

generally to all, or to a vniuerſitie,
a towne, a Citie, a countrey, a
communaltie, or to ſome publike
perſon, as to entreate of peace,
warres, apointment. &c. And ſuch
letters muſt be deuided into three
partes. Fyrſte, the name of the
Prince, and al his titles, with ſalutation.
Secōdly, the cauſe mouing
wherefore we write, declaring
that it is iuſt, honeſt, & profitable,
the which we ſhall proue
as well by reaſons as to depreſſe
oure aduerſarie, and to deſire alwayes
to maynteine Iuſtice and
equitie. Thirdly, the matter that
wee intende, be it of peace, or of
warre, or of ſome other greate
matter, and lette the concluſion
be tendyng to oure purpoſe, contaynyng
the fynall clauſes, agreable
& neceſſary therevnto, according
to the rules before written.
            
            
               
               The Example wherin the Emperour
maketh peace vvith
the kyng of Hungarie.
               
                  FRederike by the Diuine grace, Emperoure
of the Romanes, of Auſtrie,
of Syrie, Duke of &c. and Counte of. &c.
To Mathieu king of Hungarie. &c. ſendeth
gréeting: Although that there bée
many reaſons the whiche mighte prouoke
vs to make warre agaynſt thée,
m
                     •
                  e than are to be founde, that doe
perſuade vs for to make peace wyth
thée, the whiche were to long to recyte,
neyther alſo ſhall it be néedeful
for aſmuch as thou doeſt vnderſtande
them well ynoughe: yet to the ende
that to thée and thyne it maye appeare
that there is in vs more Liberalitie,
gentleneſſe, and humanitie, than deſyre
of reuengement, againſte youre
ingratitude, wée haue thoughte good
to make peace wyth thée, to thys end,
that oure warres beyng thus ceaſſed,

our people and thine, being ſore weried
and trauailed, may returne to their
houſes in their deſired peace, to reſtore
their goodes ſo diſperſed and waſted.
Thirdly, and for this cauſe I certifie by
theſe preſents, that from henceforth ſecludyng
all diſcorde and ſimulation,
which heretofore mighte haue bene betwixt
vs, we will with thée make and
eſtabliſhe firme and ſtedfaſt peace, by
the formes and conditions paſſed and
accorded betwene our ambaſſadoures.
Wherfore we admoniſh you, that thou
and thine be preſt ioyefully and with a
good will, to receiue this deſired peace,
and to kepe it on your parte inuiolated,
euen as we haue enioyned to ours, and
as we our ſelues minde to doe: to the
ende that thou mighteſt know the good
that we would thée in well and faithfully
keping this peace, and cauſing it
to be kept and obſerued without interruption,
            
            
               
               How a noble man writeth Letters
for the promotion of a man.
               WHen any Lord or noble man
writeth for the promotion of
a man, or that he writeth to him,
whome he mindeth to preferre, or
to another to prouide for hym of
whom he writeth, ſuch Letters
are to be deuided into .iij. partes,
as before. Firſt hee putteth hys
name and his titles, with briefe
ſalutation. Secondly he getteth
beneuolence to the perſon, whom
he mindeth to preferre, by prayſing
him of ſome particular vertue,
ſaying that therfore he deſerueth
to be had in fauor and eſtimation
with all men. Thirdely,
hee getteth beneuolence to hys
own perſon, ſaying that for thoſe
cauſes he is moued to ſhewe him
fauoure and commoditie: afterwards

he addeth to take in good
part the good will, for ſuch a benefite
or thing gyuen, is not ſufficient
to rewarde ſuche vertues,
offring. &c.
            
            
               The Example, vvherin the Counte
of Pauie, vvriteth in the
promotion of A.
               
                  IOannes Galeas Maria, by the grace of
God Countie of Pauie, and Lorde of
Gennes, to Angelicke ſendeth gréeting:
Secondly the excellent melody and incredible
harmonie of Muſicall ſcience,
wherein thou excelleſt not onely the other
Singers of our Chappell, but alſo
there is none whiche may be compared
vnto thée, with other great and innumerable
vertues, for the whiche of
all people both priuatly and publikely,
thou art renowmed, praiſed, eſtéemed, &
reuerenced: Such things I ſay, do prouoke
and incline me to beare thée good
will, to ayde and ſuccoure thée in thy
deſires, euen as cuſtomably wée doe to

our ſeruauntes and familiar acquaintaunce,
to the ende to ſtirre and moue
other to well doyng, when they ſée the
vertuous to be rewarded and honored.
Thirdely, and to the ende that more
playnly may appeare to you the greate
affection and loue that we beare thée,
we doe conſtitute thée to receiue in the
Coūte of Aquedoace, the fruits, rents,
profites, and reuenues due vnto vs, the
whiche wée doe fréely giue thée by theſe
preſentes, and ſo doe declare and commaunde
it: willing thée gently to receiue
it, which is too litle to bée compared
to thy vertues, truſting hereafter,
if we be of power and abilitie, that thou
ſhalte perceiue howe wée deſire the aduauncement
of our good ſeruantes by
magnifying their vertues, offring &c.
            
            
               How a prince eccleſiaſtical or temporall,
writeth Letters forbidding a thing.
               WHen a prince eccleſiaſtical or tē
                  porall
writeth to one or to many,
cōmādyng & forbidding not to

finiſhe a thing alreadie begon, or
not to take in hande a thing alredie
pretended: Such letters containe
.iij. partes. Firſte his name
and his titles, with ſalutation.
Secondly, he declareth to vnderſtande,
that hee vnto whome hée
writeth, hath enterpriſed, and
purpoſeth to finiſh a thing which
he would not haue him to execute
ſhewing the cauſes and reaſons,
either true or like to be true, diſſuading
from the doing of ſuch a
thing. Thirdly, he placeth his cō
                  maundemente
and inhibition in
briefe termes, and well to be vnderſtanded,
euen as it appertayneth
vnto a prince, adding therto
iniunctions and royal thretnings
if it be gaynſayd or withſtanded:
the which threatnings neuertheleſſe
ought to be moderated with
humanitie, and not ouercharged

with rigour, to the end that thorough
too great rigour, it be not
perceyned, that the Prince ſpeaketh
of choler or anger, the which
a wiſe man ought not to do: and
then to ſet the day and date. &c.
            
            
               The Example: wherein the Pope
forbiddeth king Ferrand
the building of a Caſtle.
               
                  INnocent Biſhop, ſeruaunt of the ſeruaunts
of God, to our ſonne Ferrand,
king of 
                     
                        •
                     ouill
                        •
                     
                   helth & apoſtolicall benediction.
Secondly, by ye Letters of oure
Reuerend brother the Cardinall of S.
Peter ad Vincula, by oure commaundement
gouerner of the Fielde Picenine,
and Legate, we haue had vnderſtāding
that in the endes and borders of the
kingdome of 
                     
                        •
                     ouill
                        •
                     
                   towards our fielde
Picenine, whiche belongeth to vs, thou
wilt breaking the appoyntementes and
concordes made betwéene vs, buylde
ſtrong places and Caſtles, as he ſayth,

hée knoweth by the reporte of dyuers
people, worthie of credite, who doe
ſay, that they haue ſeene thy preparations:
and as thou knoweſt, ſuche maner
of newe buyldings, eſpecially erected
vpon the Front of the Sea coaſt,
where they may giue greate occaſions
of euyll dooyng and hurte, are things
whiche of their owne nature, induce a
man to ſuſpition, and to thynke ſome
euyll conſpiracie. Wherefore we can
not but greately doubt, leaſte thou intendeſt
ſome treaſon agaynſte vs.
               Thirdly, wée therefore wyll thy maieſtie,
to deſiſt from buyldyng ſuche Caſtles
and Fortes agaynſte vs, if thou
wylt with vs haue peace and perpetuall
tranquillitie. But if peraduenture
thou wilte not ceaſſe, then vnderſtande
thou for a certaintie, that we ſhall be
conſtrayned to repulſe the iniurie, that
thou wouldeſt doe vnto vs, followyng
thoſe meanes whereby it is lawfull to
put away iniurie. Howebeit we haue
a confidence that thou wylte doe nothyng

that myghte bée preiudiciall
vnto vs, the whiche no good
Kyng may nor ought
to doe.
               Youen at Rome &c.
               Here endeth the firſte
Booke.
               
                  〈1 page duplicate〉

            The ſecond boke
conteinyng the Copies
of ſundry learned
mens Letters and
Epiſtles.
            
               
                  ALthough th' inſtructions
and ſtiles
heere beefore
writen might ſuffiſe
to content the
Readers of thys
Booke: yet bycauſe couragious
mindes ſhall haue abundance and
choyſe of matters, I wil not here
make a finall end, but haue thought
good (ouer and beſides all the
ſtiles of the Letters and Epiſtles
here before written) to adioyne a
number mo of Epiſtles and Letters
of ſundry ſtiles, aſwel of Latine
Orators, as alſo of other lerned
and diſcrete perſons: truſting

that the whole being wel ſeene &
conſidered, together with the inſtructions
and exquiſite termes
wherewith an auditour ought to
be furniſhed, except peraduenture
the mynd and courage of the
Reader be altogether ignorant &
ſluggiſh, of the number of them
that remayning in the gulfe and
botome of rechleneſſe haue their
ſenſe ſo corrupted, their memorie
ſo ſlppery, and their mynde ſo
dull, ſlow & aſtoonned, that they
may rightly of euery one be taken
and eſtemed as brutall and barbarous:
which ceaſſing, and a good
will ſucceding, there is no doute
but a man ſhall eaſyly learne to
make a Letter or Epiſtle ſo well
adorned, and garniſhed, that it
ſhall render vnto the Readers &
hearers not onely great ioye and
commoditie, but alſo to the endytour

profit, honor & ineſtimable
delectation.
            
               Hirmolaus Barbarus writeth vnto
George Merule.
               
                  PLato in that his diuine inſtitution of
lawes, amongſt other ſoueraigne
things, maketh mention, that it is nedefull
in the common weale to preſcribe &
giue order, that it be not permitted vnto
any man to ſhew either pryuatly or publikly
any thing that he hath compoſed,
except it be firſt peruſed and approued by
the iudges thereunto aſſigned. Would
to God (O diſcrete Merula) at this daye
we had the ſame law. Certainly ſo many
people ſhould not then write, and ſo
few ſhould not apply them ſelues to good
Letters: for now through the abundance
of many noughty bookes, we are greatly
endomaged: & leuing the approued and
knowne authors, we folow the baſe and
blynde wryters and (that which is to be
lamented) we iudge of ſtudies according

to the good or euil authors one with another,
without indifferencie or correction.
From this ſpring and fountaine is riſen
this mortall and monſtrous perſuaſion,
that Philoſophers & Conſules can not
be both alyke and eloquēt, for the which
ſentēce (bicauſe in many places we haue
argued to the contrary, as well in ſpeaking
& diſputing as by writing) I dout
not but of many I haue incurred hatred
and office, or (according to thy common
prouerbe) haue angred the waſpes. But

                     •
                  ith we haue the othe of this Knighthoode,
it were a capitall cryme to quite
ſo honorable a charge. And certainly I
ordeyne and appoynt (nowe that I haue
power & authoritie not to chyde or make
a noyſe, but by writing or interpreting
to proue my cauſe before wiſe and lerned
perſons, euen ſo as the thing it ſelf ſhal
wytneſſe) that there is altogether no
matter which this floriſhing and redie
kynde of ſaying and ſpeakyng, doeth
not recey
                     •
                  e, and hath not his naturall
hyſtory, yea and contayneth not

his very particular and ſenſible reaſōs.
For this is of Pliny the ſecond (without
all controuerſie) conſtituted and made:
but the ſame is that whereof euery one
vniuerſally maketh queſtion and debate
in ſuch ſort maner and forme, as I think
verily I my ſelfe haue firſt touched it, in
Themistio That which I haue propoſed,
I pray thée Merula, as effectually as I
can deuiſe, that thou woldeſt ſay for me
euen as for thy ſelfe, and that thou woldeſt
be not onely my defender, but my
helper iudge and corrector. For certainly
it can not be denied, but that in Philoſophie
there are ſundry places, the which
to vtter and expreſſe, it is néedefull and
neceſſary ſometimes to faine, & renewe.
And this doeth Marcus Tullius, and all
the other auncient and greate Philoſophers
graunt & allow: the which is now
by maner of prelocution and reuerence
graūted vnto vs: & as he ſayth we may
name and place new wordes, where we
ſée the Latin to be corrupted or altered,
as in the names of money and coyne or
ſuch lyke. And herein would I haue thée

to be an egall Cenſor or Iudge, if peraduēture
thou findeſt in theſe bookes any
thing either altogether fayned to the ſē
                  blance
of certayne voyces, or by licence,
that I ſay not rudely or hardly tranſlated,
or by abuſe to boldly tranſpoſed, or
elſe by a certayne imitation ſomwhat to
cōfirmable. Howbeit I think thou ſhalt
not finde many which might offend thée,
or be troubleſome: tenne at the moſt or
thereabouts, thou ſhalt find in the whole
worke that I ſende thee here withall, the
which a man may ſay are not takē rightly
from the Latin, and yet is there ſome
of them that we haue receyued and taken
euen from the Latin eares, ſome we
haue newly made, for the other I take
no diſdayne of the vſage of learned and
wiſe men: howbeit I will not ſeeme to
affirme my ſelf to be wholly vnreprouable,
leaſt peraduenture ſome doe obiect &
ſay, if thou excuſe thy ſelfe that thou art
not barbarous, what is it then that thou
ſayſt? And thus I wholly ſubmit my
cauſe to the indifferent iudge, voyde of
parcialitie. Farewel. From 
                     Ʋenice. 1480
            
            
               
               Hirmolaus Barbarus vvriteth to
Angelus Politianus.
               IN that thou haſt conceiued incredible
ioy for my proſperities, thou haſt therin
done no newe thing, nor any thing
which I had not before hande well ſéene,
& by imagination preſuppoſed. I knowe
with what carefulneſſe & great forwardneſſe
of vnderſtanding, thou haſt taken
in hand this buſy & vnſpeakable charge
to adorne & extoll my name: & although
that thou haſt therein ben conſtant, diligent,
& effectuous, yet ſith in ſo doing it
ſéemeth that thou ſpeakeſt for thy ſelfe,
when thou ſpeakeſt for me) I doe nothing
maruell in yt thou haſt thought to
profit thy ſel
                     •
                  , when thou haſt ben about
myne affayres. I giue thanks vnto thée,
and will giue continually, not only as to
a louer and a frende, but euen as vnto
Politian, that is to ſay, vnto a man right
wiſe. And certainly it is a greater thing
to be praiſed of Politian, than of a frend:
for the teſtimony and iudgement of a
frende might be deceaued: but of Politian
                  
a frende, neuer deceaued. And to my
Lord Laurentius, no leſſe my prince than
thyne, I am greatly bound and beholdē.
he himſelfe thereof is witneſſe: I am in
great danger leaſt that in ſo many benefits
& merits, which it hath pleaſed him
to beſtowe vpon me, I appeare not to be
vngratefull and barbarous.
            
            
               Marſilius Ficinus vvriteth vnto
Angelus Politianus.
               IF now Politian, I ſhould ſay, that I
greatly maruelled at the hautineſſe &
eloquence of thy ſtyle, ſome peraduenture
woulde ſuppoſe that I were to full
of maruelling: certainly in others I am
accuſtomed to maruell at things for the
noueltie of them, but in Politian, I maruell
at things which are vnto me of a
long time very well knowne, howbeit
for a veritie I now haue in admiration
not olde things, but new things. For
my Politian, hath ſo happyly encreaſed
within ſhort ſpace ſynce his youth, that

for his ſtyle he ſéemeth vnto me wholly
another man, and altogether new: and
therefore he that being euen a child, hath
not ſmally pleaſed me, and being a yong
man greatly pleſed me, now that he hath
paſſed his youth, doth perfectly and worthily
pleaſe me: for euen as his beautie
hath dayly encreaſed, ſo alſo hath increaſed
his grace. And certainly alſo this pleſeth
me well that it ſhould ſo bée, for this

as it were prognoſticated, that it would
ſo come to paſſe, therfore I pray thée hold
on as thou haſt begon. Diuine, to the
ende that thou maiſt likewiſe make me
a true Diuinator. In reſpect of that that
thou extolleſt ye 
                  Marſilian in euery place
with paſſing praiſes, I doe maruell no
whit at all. Who is he that in pronouncing
his proper praiſes, is not vehement
and warmeth not him ſelfe? who is hee,
ſo vnſenſible, that delyteth not himſelfe
in that which belongeth vnto him ſelfe:
Francus declared vnto vs that thou haſt
had talke of vs with all the wiſe and
learned, eſpecially with Hirmolaus Barbarus.
                  
What wilt thou that I do for thée?
certainly I wil willingly do it. Farewel.

Marſilius Ficinus.
               THou perceiueſt not in me euery day
new things which are worthy to be
praiſed, but rather new things in thy
ſelfe, through yt which thou praiſeſt mée:
and that which ſemeth vnto thée ſuch abundance,
is thy excéeding loue whereby
(as Propertius recyteth) of nothing is
rayſed a great hiſtory. And veryly I
think thou wilt make me a Diuinator,
for thou haſt cauſed me to Diuine, whē
as euery day I ſay and preach that thou
art a Diuine. Farewell.

               MY welbeloued Sonne, health and
Apoſtolicall benediction. The booke
which thou lately didſt ſende vnto vs,
tranſlated out of Greke into Latin, we

haue hartely and gladly receiued, aſwell
for the noueltie of the thing, as for the
iudgement of diuers, whome in theſe
partes we eſteme for learned and wiſe:
It is ſo well furniſhed with learning
and wit, that therewith our Lybrarie
ſhalbe greatly adorned: and therfore we
giue thée moſt hartie thanks, recommending
thy vertue vnto our Lord, and exhorting
thée from henceforth to perſeuer
in ſuch lyke things: to the ende that by
theſe honeſt labours, thou mayſt one day
get greater prayſes, and that thou maiſt
deſerue at our hands more fertile grace.
And in token, aſwell of the good will
that we know to be in thée, as for the
great fatherly loue that we beare towards
thée, we haue thought good to ſend
thée two hundred Crownes, by our welbeloued
ſonne Iohn Turnabon, to the
ende that by ſuche ſuccour of liuing,

accomplyſh thy labours and workes.

thanks, moſt holy Father Innocent,
Soueraigne Biſhop, which haſt with ſo
great prayſes, and ample liberalitie rewarded
our ſmall labours, which thing
I conſider and interpret to haue ben ſo

done for this cauſe: to wit, that it hath
pleaſed thy holyneſſe and bleſſedneſſe by

when they vnderſtand to be in ſuch

theſe prayſes togither with the preſēt

haue added vnto me as it were ſpurs

I be found to be vnworthy of this thy liberalitie
and fauour, wherevpon I will
take care, and will ſo enforce my ſelfe,

if I ſhould commend me an hundreth

not to accompt me for one of thoſe that
wiſh you well, therefore I pray you commend
me vnto you: certifying you that
ſynce my departure, I haue written ſufficient
matter vnto you, according to my
rudeneſſe, whereunto you haue made me
no aunſwere. Howbeit I maruell not
thereat, conſidering that you haue ben
ſo buſyed about the vrgent affaires of
the king, that you haue had no leyſure to
attend thereunto, wherefore you are
worthely to be excuſed. And though it be
ſo that I am tranſported into a farre
cuntry to execute needfull things, yet is
it not to be ſuppoſed, that true loue ſhold

betwene two frendes, whereof you are
the one and I the other, at the leaſt I am

yours, and beleue that you are myne.
And therefore as myne, I haue not nor
wil not deferre to write vnto you, truſting
and being aſſured, that through the
receiuing of my Letters, I ſhall cauſe
you to be more ioyfull, and to haue me
in remembrance. Doing you alſo thereby
to vnderſtand, that if it would ſo
pleaſe you, I would gladly haue certaine
little bookes (whereof I ſpake vnto you)
diſpatched from the bynding, hanſomely
and fynely, as you know wel how to doe

to expreſſe or write vnto you. Of a thing
well done the praiſe remayneth to the
Author and doer thereof, wherein I
know you ſhall be partaker, for that you
worke ſo perfectly that no man will nor
can fynde fault therewith. Moreouer if
there be any thing in theſe partes wherin
I may pleſure you, doe but commaūd
it, and I will obey according to the poſſibilitie
of your ſayd frend, not to be compared

vnto your wife, and to all your children,
vnto whome I will not forget the wine,

you health and welfare with long life.
From Selurre, the .xj. day of October.
            
            
               An Epiſtle of Angelus Politianus
to Laurencius de Medicis
his Vncle.
               
                  BAptiſta Leo Florentius of the moſt
clere and noble family of the Albertins,
a man of excellent ſprite, of good and
depe iudgement, & of exquiſite Doctrine,
hauing left vnto his poſteritie many noble
déedes, acts and monuments, conſequently
& in fine thought good to report
vpon .x. bookes ſpeaking of Architecture,
or the Scyence of Buylding: the which
being amended, corrected and poliſhed,
intending to ſet them forth to light, and
to dedicate them vnto thy name, was by
fatall ordinance preuented by death and
ſo deceaſſed. His brother Bernarde, a prudent

man, always myndefull of thée amongſt
ye chiefeſt, to the ende to aduance
the memory of ſo worthy a man, and to
render thankes for thy merites on him
beſtowed: the foreſayd bookes written according
to their true paterns and examples,
and reduced into one volume, doeth
offer and preſent them vnto thee, my good
Laurentius: and in very deede he deſired
that I ſhould commend and adorne with
woords the ſame gift towards thée, & alſo
towardes the authour thereof, Baptista
Leo. The which I haue not thought good
to doe in any caſe, to the ende yt through
the defaulte of my vnderſtanding, I diminiſhe
not the praiſes of a man ſo excellent,
and of a worke ſo well brought
to paſſe and finiſhed: for vnto that worthy
worke ſhall come more honour and
renowne by the learning and reading of
it, than by any woordes wherewith I am
able to ſet forth the prayſes thereof, fearing
and douting the difficulties of the
Epiſtle, and douting alſo the imbecillitie
and weakeneſſe of our Oration: for vnto
any man not ignorant of the perfection

and integritie of the remoued Letters,
and of the ſecrete and hidde diſcipline,
it myght bée doubted whether
his ſpeache and ſtile doeth more touch
the Arte of Oratorie, or of Poetrie,
whether it bée more graue or Ciuill.
In this order he hath folowed the true
trace of the Antiquitie, in ſuch ſorte
that hée hath by ſenſe comprehended
and reduced into example, not onely
the reaſons of the auncyent Buylders,
their engyns and inſtrumentes
to woorke withall, but alſo hath wonderfully
excogitated and publiſhed the
formes and ſtyles of Buildings: yea
and beſydes this, hée was alſo a good
Paynter, and a cunning Caruer. Howbeit
it in the meane tyme hee ordred all
thinges according to true proportion
and meſure, in ſuch ſorte that all people
myght report of him ſingular and worthy
things, ſo that I iudge and ſuppoſe,
that I were better to bée ſilent
than to ſpeake to little, euen as Saluſte
ſayed of Carthage. To this booke therefore,

O Laurentius) thou ſhalt attribute
moſt principall and chiefeſt place
in thy Lybrarie, and ſhalt reade it diligently:
and ſhalte take care to publiſhe
it commonly: for it is worthy to paſſe
often by the mouthes of expert and learned
men, yea it is a fauorer and a very
patrone of learning, amongſt all men
lyuing now falne vnto thy lorte. Farewel.
            
            
               Angelus Politianus to a
certaine friende
of his.
               IF I had begoon to haue loued thée for
thy richeſſe, I ſhould now haue ceaſſed
to loue thée, or to be thy frende, for that
thou now ceaſſeſt to be rich: but moreouer,
if I hadde nowe ceaſſed to haue
ben thy frende, then hadde I not ben
thy frende neither when thou weart
rich, but a flatterer: the which whoſoeuer
can be, can not be frée but a bondſlaue.
            
            
               
               Politian to his frends.
               YOu are many which together demaund
Letters from me, but beholde
I ſende vnto many but one onely: for it
behoueth to ſend one onely Epiſtle vnto
many whome I onely loue. The which
ſhal be as good as many, when many of
you ſhall reade it.
            
            
               Politian to an enuious perſon.
               THou arte enuious to euerie one of
euery thing ſaue enuie, but of that
thou art enuious towards thy lyke, who
is yet more enuious than thou: and by
that meanes there is no enuie in thée:
and yet notwithſtanding thou haſt enuie
at his enuie: and by that meanes he is
leſſe enuious than thou. Who you are, I
will not expreſſe, bicauſe I wil not make
you more miſerable than you are alredy,
for if I ſhould publiſh your name, you
would haue enuie euen at your verie
name it ſelf, not onely one of you at that
of ye other, but either of you at his owne.
            
            
               
               Politian to a Slanderer and
detracter
               VNto thée which ſpeakeſt euill of me,
I intend not to anſwer euill, leſt peraduenture
thou ſhouldeſt ceaſe from ſaying
euil by mée, that is to wit, from praiſing
mée: for in very deede who is he that
is more rightly praiſed, than he of whom
euill is ſpoken by an euill man? And in
reſpect that I call thée an euill man, that
is ſo farre from being euill ſayd, that nothing
can be better ſayd.
            
            
               Politian to his friend Caeſar
Carmente.
               THou ſuppoſeſt thy ſelfe to be contemned,
bicauſe I write not vnto thée, I
ſhould contemne thée if I ſhould write
vnto thée: for if I contemned thée, then
durſt I write vnto thee theſe aunſwers,
either that I am buſyed, or that I haue
no leyſure for thée. Farewell.
            
            
               
               Politian, to Iames
Modeſte.
               THou art ſory bycauſe I write not vnto
thée: be ſory no more, for now I
write vnto thee. Farewell.
            
            
               Politian to an vnconſtant
perſon.
               THou haſt not giuen me that which
thou didſt promiſe mée: I fynde my
ſelf greued if thou haſt forgot it: and yet
more gréeued if thou haſt not forgot it:
to forget, is ye propertie ſcarce of a friend
& not to giue when it is remembred, is
the propertie altogether of an enimie.
Farewell.
            
            
               Angelus Politianus to Picus
Mirandula.
               THat which I would ſhould haue ben
corrected by thée, thou praiſeſt it, bnt

thou doeſt that thing eaſily, which thou
doeſt always. Farewell.
            
            
               Politian to a friende
of his.
               THou art angry and ſory bicauſe Simias
doeth reprehend mée, he doeth
not reprehende mée, to the ende that
hee might ſearch the ſauegard of hys
lyfe, as a man beſet with ſome that doe
much reioyce of flatterers, and yet more
of detracters.
            
            
               Politian to a promyſe
breaker.
               MVch more equall haddde it ben incontinently
to haue denyed that
which ſo earneſtly I haue requeſted,
than afterwardes not to performe the
thing which thou being a graue man
hadſt ſo liberally promyſed, for than
hadde it ben no iniurie, ſeing that thou
didſt owe mée nothing: but now it is

iniury, for thou doſt owe it me, and muſt
owe it me, ſeing that thou haſt promiſed
it me: and certainly I doe not yet beleue
that thou art of that ſort of people,
whome their promiſes doe not bynd thē:
and to the ende that I haue not hereafter
occaſyon to beleue it, I would wiſhe
thée to kepe ſuch promiſes to thy ſelfe.
Onely this I requeſte thée, that if thou
wilte not giue and performe vnto me
that benefit, yet ceaſe to be iniurious vnto
me, which thou ſhalt do if thou forbid
me to hope any longer in vayne. Fi
                     •
                  nally,
I ſhall be greatly beholden vnto
thée, if thou giue me yt which I requeſt,
and ſhall greatly maruell if thou giue it
me not Farewell.
            
            
               Politian to his frende.
               
                  I Was very ſory, and am very glad, bicauſe
thou waſt ſick, and that thou art
hole. Farewell.
            
            
               
               Politian to Picus Mirandula.
               
                  I Was firſt vanquiſhed of thée by learning,
and vanquiſhed by ſpirit, yet neuertheleſſe
I reioyce me to be vanquiſhed,
and doe in ſuch ſort reioyce me, for
I loue thée, and loue that by the which I
was vanquiſhed: but now by thy humanitie
am I vanquiſhed, which thing certainly
I can not ſuffre, bicauſe it is vnhoneſt,
but I doe ſuffer it, for there is
nothing vnhoneſt vnto me, which vnto
thée is not honeſt.
            
            
               Politian to a certaine frende
of his.
               THou art ſory bicauſe I whiche am
thy frende, haue vanquiſhed thée in
diſputation, thou oughteſt not to bée ſory:
for if all things be common vnto
frends, I am no more a vanquiſher than
thou: & no leſſe vanquiſhed than thou.
But peraduenture thou art ſory, bicauſe
that by ſuch law of frendes, I am not a
perfect vanquiſher, I whiche haue thée

vanquiſhed. Farewell.
            
            
               An Epiſtle of Iohannes Picus Mirandula,
to his dere frende
Iacobus Antiquarius.
               AMongſt all the pleaſures which I
tooke whē I was at Florence, through
the allowable cuſtome of Politian, (a
man according vnto my iudgement, of
all other moſt learned & ſkilfull, as touching
them of our tyme) this was not
the leaſt, but exceded, when he incontinently
gaue vnto me thy graue Epiſtles
ſent vnto him, to the ende that I might
reade them with their aunſweres, in the
ſame forme and excellent order that they
paſſed betwene you: In thoſe letters and
Epiſtles I did greatly delyte me, for the
ſingular prudence therein contayned,
whereby alſo in weightie matters and
great affayres, thou art of the moſt prudent
and wiſe greatly commended, both
for the ſobrietie and alſo for the ſéemely
adorning & beautifying of thy Oration.
Furthermore thy Letters were accepta-

vnto me, not onely bicauſe in ſome of
them there was honorable mentyon
made of my name, but alſo I delyted
my ſelf therein for the teſtimonie of ſuch
a perfect man, by reaſon of the cōſcience,
graunting and giuing iuſt cōſent, which
not diſſembling any thing of that which
it thought, did manyfeſt and diſcouer the
matter euen as it was ſtryuing with
great force, as nylling to be deceued: And
thus am I double beholding vnto thee,
by reaſon of thy vertue, and alſo of thy
benefits done vnto vs. I had thought by
my Epiſtles ſundry times to haue rendred
thee thanks, leaſt peraduenture towardes
thee I ſhould haue ben thought
ſomewhat vngratefull, or eſtéemed rude
and vnciuile: yet deferred I the tyme
(bicauſe I know thée and our good frend
Politian, to be ſo exerciſed with letters,
paſſing to and fro betwene you,) as not
willing with ſuch importunate haſt to
bable againſt the Muſes, & as the malepert
gagling geeſe, to interrupt ye white
Swans enterchāgeably ſinging: beſides

this I perceiued by Politian, that thou
hadſt vnderſtanding of our good wil towards
thée. And now haue we receiued
thy letters ſent vnto vs, (lately deliuered
to Bernard Ricius, a yong man of gret towardneſſe)
wherein thou doeſt attribute
vnto me, that which I dare not requeſt,
neither think to haue ſo much merited.
The greatneſſe of thy humanitie doeth
now burſt our ſylence, except we ſhould
ſéeme vnciuile or proude, and therefore I
can not chooſe but giue the great thanks,
and impart vnto thée immortal praiſes:
not onely bycauſe thou beſtoweſt vpon
me no ſmall vndeſerued praiſes, but alſo
by reaſon that thou ſo tēderly loueſt me.
Therefore vnto thée I ought to make
recompenſe euen aboue my power, neither
is ther any thing ſo hard or difficile,
which for thy commoditie I would not
take in hande. Farewell. Made in the
fieldes of Ferrare the .27. of Iuly. 1494.

already thrée monthes
ago, and now at thys
preſent going on the
fourth, ſynce we receiued
any Letters from thée: me thinkes
thou mighteſt haue coniectured with thy
ſelfe (if thy heart had not ben altogether
ſtony) in what troubles and calamities I
with thy wéeping and ſorowfull mother
doe liue. There are now .xxiiij. wynters
gon and paſt, ſynce forth of thy mothers
wombe into this trāſitory lyfe thou waſt
brought, & bycauſe euen from thy youth
vpward, I was a carefull and deſyrous
Father to ſee thée good, modeſt, gentle,
kynde, and with all other vertues adorned

(beholding then thy ſharpe wit & liuely
memory of thy naturall inclination
and ſpirite) I thought good (as thou knoweſt)
to ſend thée to Paris. to the ſtudie of
the Ciuill Lawes, according to thyne
owne deſyre: thou haſt now ben there
foure yeares, and I determined to giue
thee yerely an hundred Crownes for the
ſuſtentation of thy lyuing, to wit, at the
ende of euery ſix monthes fiftie: & moreouer
to ſende thée Clothes of Silke and
of Woll, for the apparell of thy body.
Thou ſhalt vnderſtand (my déere childe)
that thy mother hath ben my wife .xxvj.
yeres: I haue had (by the goodneſſe of
God) of hir two children onely, whereof
thou art the firſt, and after thée Loyſe
thy Siſter, vpon whoſe vertuous life the
Sunne beames hauing ſhyned by the
ſpace of .xxiij. yeres, and I knowing hir
worthy of a huſband, haue thought good
this yere to mary hir, and to giue hir to
Hely Loyer, for his legitimate and lawfull
ſpouſe: and bicauſe that he is a rich
man, it behoued me for the full ſūme of
hir mariage to giue three thouſād poūds,

ſo that I was cōſtrained to pay him not
onely all the redy money that I had, but
alſo to borow more than three hundreth
Crownes, bicauſe I would not fayle to
the fidelitie and promiſe which I hadde
made hym. This therfore was the occaſion
that with my Letters of the viij. of
Auguſt laſt paſt, I had not the meane to
ſende thée more than thirty Crownes,
within theſe .xv. or .xx. dayes I will ſende
thée the other twenty, for the full accompliſhing
of the terme paſt, and the fiftie
for the beginning of the yere preſent:
Therefore for default of the ſayd money
ceaſſe not from any maner of ſtudy: but
now it pleaſeth me to talke a little vnto
thée. Thou then drawne by diſdayn, and
moued with vniuſt yre, for ſo light an occaſyon
(as voluntarily willing to worke
vengeance) ſtayeſt thou to giue anſwer
vnto ye humaine & gentle Epiſtles of thy
Father, vnto the ſwete & louing Letters
of thy Mother? diſdayneſt thou to aunſwere

ſhould make recompenſe to theyr

Fathers and mothers for the goodneſſe
of them receiued. Thou then my deare

take forth with thy penne and write, to
comfort hir. Thou oughteſt to remember
(as a reaſonable man) yt ſhe brought
thee into this world, that thou waſt tenderly
& warmly noriſhed in hir wombe,
& that thou didſt there receiue thy life,
lymmes, fleſh, blood, ſynowes & bones:

diligent a father I haue ben for thee (to

               DErely beloued Father, after moſte
humble commendatiōs vnto you, and

my louing mother, beſeching you both of
your dayly bleſſing. &c. Father although
I knowe your aduiſe to be truer than
the voyce of ye humaine Sibyle, or the oracle
of Apollo, yet neuertheleſſe I thinke
it my dutie to make briefe aunſwere vnto
your ſwete and learned Letters. You
by them (together the great pitie of my
Mother) haue made myne eyes ſo tēderly
moyſted with teares, that not onely in
one thing, but alſo in many, if I had ben
before your preſence (your Fatherly benignitie,
together with my Mothers clemencie
conſidered) you would certainly
haue iudged your onely Sonne worthie
of pardon. He that ſhoulde blaſpheme
God, yea or his Father or Mother, me
thinketh he were not worthy to be reaſoned
withal, but rather to be puniſhed:
for in veritie, there is nothing more vnſeemely
in a yong man, than to giue
occaſion of anger vnto a man of rype
age. Therefore as Marcus Cicero
writeth, wyſedome is the knowledge
of good and euyll thynges: And thys

goeth morally, Ariſtotle diſputing ſaith,
that it falleth not for youth: therefore the
moraliſt Seneca ſwetely writeth, that the
wiſe man is temperate and conſtant: &
he that is conſtant and without perturbation,
& without wickedneſſe, is he that
is quiet and vntroubled: then to cōclude,
the wiſe man is happie. Therfore extēd
your pitie vnto me: for according to the
ſentence of Fabian Quintilian, he that
repenteth him of his errour, is worthy
of pardon. But bicauſe I wil not be long
in writing, it may pleaſe you to vnderſtand,
that in this Towne of Paris, we
haue greate ſcarcitie of victualles this
yeare. Corne is at a high pryce: I ſay
nothing vnto you of wyne, which at this
day is riſen vnto ſuch a pryce, that of many
perſons, it is quite forſaken. I know
well, my dere Father and Mother, that
you would not haue me to endure ſcarcitie
of victualles, for the which my garments
already foure monthes ago, are
gauged to myne Hoſt, which cauſeth me
to be more importunate to demaund money
of you, which through your goodneſſe

I attend for with earneſt deſyre. To fyniſh,
(my duety vnto you both remembred)
I humbly recommend me, and alſo
vnto my welbeloued Syſter.

               VErily my Sonne, thou wilt be the
occaſion through thy euill behauior,
to haſte me ſooner than I thought vnto
my graue: for one of theſe dayes in this
Towne of Lyons, many gentlemen and
marchants affirmed vnto me, that al the
clothes of Scarlet which thou didſt cary
with thee are loſt. Alſo I am aduertiſed
by my truſty frendes, that ſundry dames
in Lyons, go ſumptuouſly arayed with
our clothes of Silke, and thou of them
haſt none other payment, but that thou
takeſt accompt ſecretly in ye night. This
is not the fayth which thou didſt promiſe
me at thy departure: therefore thy mother

continually wéepeth, and thy two
vertuous and honeſt Siſters lament
without ceaſſing. But tel me, with what
knyues thinckeſt thou that thou doeſt
wounde the moſt ſecrete partes of oure
hearts: therefore be redy to amend thy
errour, or elſe veryly ceaſſe to call me
Father, and holde thy ſelfe aſſured (except
thou amend) that neither of my
goods nor money thou ſhalt euer haue any
parte hereafter.

               MY dearely beloued Father, I haue
ben aduertiſed by your ſorowful letter
of euill aduenture of our marchandiſe:
but bicauſe you are my Father & a
prudent Father, it is lawfull for you
without occaſion, to reprehende and to
threaten me: howbeit he that cōmitteth
not the fault, is always accompanied

with ſwéete hope. Thoſe that haue tolde
you yt I giue your clothes of Silke vnto
the dames of Lyons, peraduenture haue
taken it in euill part, that I haue not giuen
ſome péece of ſilk vnto their wiues,
& wold peraduenture haue taken no 
                     •
                  
to haue aſked them from whence ye garmēt
had come, ſo yt they ſpare theyr pēs.
I pray you therfore my deare Father, be
content & glad: for I conſume not your
goods, but I ſell them aſwel vnto women
as vnto men. I ſend you by your Factour
two thouſād pounds for clothes of Scarlet,
& ſix hundreth poundes for clothes of
ſilke: I will tary to finiſh the reſt, & the
curſed enuie languiſhing, ſhall fall vnto
the ground: and you ſhal finde me (God
to frend) a good, iuſt & faithful Sonne &c.

rather than myne owne. &c.
               
                  
Synce your departure hence, God knoweth
in how many careful cogitations &
thoughts I haue lyued: and certainly in
all my tribulations through your abſence,
I haue found none greater than
in one whole yeare with much a doe to
haue receiued from you onely two ſhort
Letters. It may be yt ſome great affaires
of the Court would not permit you time
to write, or peraduenture that no care of
vs doeth prick you forwarde. Theſe verily
were not your promiſes made vnto
me at your departure. It may pleaſe you
to vnderſtand, that our two children are
in good Health, and encreaſe in ſtature,
but not in maners, which to them ſhould
appertayne: we are riche of ſubſtaunce
more than otherwiſe, therfore take heede
leaſt couetouſneſſe doe ſurmount & ouercome
you: For riches wil be ſmall ornaments
for our Children, without the
brightnes of ſome vertues. Beſides this,
forget you not yt I haue not any lacke of
things neceſſary for lyuing: but know
ye that I am a wife, and that yong, not
better nor worſe than other. Therefore

I beſéech and require you that you will
come vnto vs, for we haue great néede of
you, & not of money:

                  nd thus with gret

you, that within theſe fewe dayes I
reciued ſome very lamentable Letters
from you, by the which you doe greatly
complaine of mée, for yt I ſhould be ſlow
in writing vnto you: you thinck peraduenture
that from hence where I am in
Ly
                        •
                     ns vnto Amboyſe, is like diſtaunce
of way as from Bloys to Tours. Verily
I haue written at the leaſt nyne tymes
in the yeare. And often it hapneth (as you
might conſider) that by negligence of the

Cariers letters are loſt. But to procéede
farther when I parted from you, I had
thought that I parted ioyfully, leauing
in your lap our two children, with ſtedfaſt
confidence to haue committed them
to a prudent, ſage, temperate, careful, diligent,
and heartie wife, about the gouerning
of domeſticall affaires, wherein
me thinks there ſhould be no default in
you. You write vnto me, that you are a
wife & yong, with that which foloweth:
I ſay that when I maryed you, I tooke
you not onely for a wife, but alſo for the
moſt vertuous, moſt cha
                     •
                  t, moſt honeſt &
moſt ſkilfull of all other of your age. I
am not couetous, as peraduenture you
ſuppoſe: true it is, that I am come vnto
the Court to aduantage vs and our children
aſmuch as I can, which may hereafter
be cauſe of ioyfull quietneſſe. At this
preſent I will write no further: God
willing within theſe thrée monethes I
truſt to be with you. And thus I commit
you and all ours to the bleſſed Trinitie.

               MY welbeloued Brother, after moſt
heartie commendatiōs vnto you &c.
I can not expreſſe nor declare in wordes
what greuous ſorowes and paſſions I
haue receiued for the death of Frauncis
your louing & faithful ſpouſe. Therefore
were not ye extreme teares & gret anguiſhes
wherewith I am bitterly accompanied,
I might peraduenture find out for
you ſome maner of conſolation: but certainly
very ill may he help an other that
can not in any wiſe helpe himſelfe. Any
other meane is there not, ſaue only reaſon,
which might comfort you to take
with a good heart, the fierce and vncertaine
death of that honeſt, vertuous, and
chaſt wife: who through the merites of
hir vertues, I eſtéeme without al dout to
be gone to poſſeſſe the eternall Triumphes
of ye heuenly glory. Wherfore then
ought we more to lamēt ye vngētlenes of
enuious death, which in ye end deſtroyeth
all things created, than we ought quietly

to render the money which we haue borowed?
for the gift of life lent vnto vs
by the generall Paſtour, ought to be reſtored
without any lamentation. Therfore
I pray you, ſtudy with me to prayſe
God for the faithfull departure of your
welbeloued out of this tranſitory lyfe:
And ſo bring vp Loyſe my déere niece,
that ſhe may follow the maners of hir
Mother. Would the bitter rayne of the
humour that falleth from myne eyes
haue ceaſſed, I would haue bene more
large in writing vnto you. The eternall
God of his infynite pitie, preſerue you
and yours in peace and proſperitie.
               
                  Your louing Siſter. &c.

to ceaſſe the abundance of the moyſt humour

guſhing from myne eyes: therefore
I can not by any ſufficient wordes,
expreſſe the thankes which I do owe, &
euen vntill the laſt day of my life ſhall
owe vnto your pitie, goodneſſe, and curteſie.
I know how tenderly you take the
memory of Francis: alſo I know the
effect of the ſingular loue, which ſhe bare
vnto you. Your Niece humbly recommendeth
hir vnto your benignitie, I
truſt that ſhe wil follow in all things the
gentleneſſe and honeſty of that hir vertuous
Mother deceaſſed. We in the

                  re daughter)

were your letters vnto me, partly for hauing
aduiſe of your health, and partly to
vnderſtande that Peter your ſonne doeth
ſo diligently attend to the beginning of
his ſtudie. To aduertiſe you by motherly
charitie, of that thing which apperteyneth
both vnto my honeſty and yours, it
is ſo, that within this lytle whyle I haue
by diuers voyces vnderſtanded, (I wot
not what) of your yll renoume, frō thoſe
partes of your Towne of Bloys: You
know (my doughter) yt at ſixtene yeares
of age I was maryed, and at .xxiij. remained
widow with two children, and vnto
this my age of .lij. yeares, there was neuer
none veryly that could ſay any thing
againſt the integritie of my life: neither
haue I at any tyme paſſed for a huſband.
Thou veryly at .xvj. yeares didſt take a
huſband, and now at .xxxv. yeares remaineſt
widow with one Sonne onely .xix.
yeares haſt thou poſſeſſed thy huſband:
therfore thou oughteſt to be ſatiſfied of
worldly things. Thou art rich, and arte
left vnder the ſtate of a widow: Oh, I
pray thée for the loue of the eternal God,

and for the obeyſaunce that thou oweſt
vnto me, that thou wilt be well aduiſed
not to maculate or blot that wydowiſh
and decent habyte which thou bereſt, for
the worſhip of him, who of thy virginitie
gathered the firſt frute. The Lord be
with thée.
               
                  Thy pitifull mother.
&c.
               
            
            
               The Daughter maketh anſwere
vnto hir Mother.
               DEre and welbeloued Mother, after
moſt humble and reuerent commendations
with the deſyre of your long life
&c. Through your laſt briefe Letters I
am become altogither melancholike and
ſorowful: & that not for the occaſiō ſpringeth
of you, but of the vnpappyneſſe of
ye wicked world. Verily with moſt-humble
obedience, I receiue al thoſe admonitions
which come from you my diſcret

mother. Hippolit, as we reade in the
auncient hiſtories, bicauſe he would not
conſent to Thaedra his horrible Mother,
was by hir occaſion cruelly put to death,

without deſerts: ſo I by the peſtiferous
tongues of others, am innocently ſclaundered.
Wherfore hearkē I pray you my
déere Mother, you know Clare very wel,
who hath a brother .xxiiij. yeares olde, a
dronkard, euill taught, a gamner, and a
glutton, theſe two yeares hath he by letters,
gifts and promiſes gon about diſhoneſtly
to tempt me, and this doeth he not
ſomuch for his owne deſyre, as for the
wicked will of his Siſter Clare, who
being about .xxx. yeares of age and richly
maryed, but vnto an olde man, is very liberall
of hir loue vnto who ſo euer demaundeth
it. And bicauſe that ſhe is my
neighbour, ſhe wold gladly haue me ioyned
in loue with hir brother: but that
ſhall notwithſtanding nothing preuayle
him, though miſtruſtfull perſons ſpeake
their pleaſure. No more at this time, you
vnderſtande me well. God proſper and
preſerue you.

Daughter. &c.

would pleaſe hym to ſerue your honor,
in the office of a Secretarie, bicauſe he
is a man ſkilfull, quiet, and of maruellous
elegancie in compoſing: verily I
vſed all the meanes that I could to induce
him vnto your honors deſire: the
aſſaultes that I gaue vnto hym of that
matter in the beginning did nothing auaile:
for he excuſed himſelf to be wearie
of ſeruing lordes, and that he nowe
loued to reſte, and to giue hym ſelfe to
nouriſhe his litle childe: But in fine I
ſo handled the matter, that within one
moneth he wil depart hence to go vnto
you. I told him that your honor would

vſe ſuch liberalitie as his vertue requireth.
I take great pleaſure for that your
Lordſhippe ſhall haue néere you a man
prudent, loyall, learned, a wonderfull
obſeruer of antiquities, a great hiſtorian,
and in the pleſant paſtime of poetrie,
a man without compariſon: which
ſhall be great ſatiſfaction to the ardent
zeale of the diuine vnderſtandyng of
your excellencie: which I pray God ſtil
to proſper and encreaſe. &c.

in howe troubleſome and wearie
exerciſes we haue conſumed the other
part of our tranſitorie & miſerable life,
therfore your honour by the humanitie
therof, muſt pardon our vnlearned letters:

& good Secretarie of our affaires. Certainly
I loue his humanitie and gētleneſſe,

his iudgemēt doth greatly pleaſe
me, & the eloquence of his ſpeach deliteth
me. If all ye holy church of the chriſtians,
had aſwel choſen their biſhops,
deacons, and miniſters, as I haue done
my Secretarie, vndoutedly ye true Religion
of our Catholike faith would be
had more in reuerence, and better ſpoken

time. I certifie your lordſhippe
that as ſoone as our forſayd Secretarie
came to ſalute vs, we immediately of

Crownes of golde. God for his clemencie
ſend proſperitie to our affaires: for

which you with your friends and kinſfolkes
do appeare to be willing to giue
me thanks, for that I haue choſen your
ſonne into the order of my men of Armes.
I will aunſwere you briefly: vnderſtand
ye then that in feates of chiualrie,
where the matter ſtandeth of
life and death, of pouertie and richeſſe,
of honour and ſhame, I make not election
by frendſhip or fauour, but I preferre
mē to higher degrée by their vertue:
and therfore the wiſedome, counſell,
and manly courage of your ſonne,
conſtrained me to honour him, who is
readie to be further preferred: you in
the meane time liue quietly, and if he
doe you honour, giue the praiſe to God
and not vnto me. The eternall haue
you in his keping. &c.

               RIght worſhipfull, my heartie commendations
vnto you remembred,
&c. I haue preſentely receyued youre

grateful Letters, which were welcom
vnto me for two cauſes: Firſt bicauſe
they were yours▪ and ſecondly bicauſe
with them I receiued from youre worſhip
a liberall preſente, to wit, halfe a
doſen Pheſants, and a couple of Kyds.
I hartily thank your gentleneſſe. We
are alſo hunters, but it behoueth vs to
pray vnto Diana, the auncient Goddeſſe
of the foreſts, yt ſhe would vouchſafe to
ſende vs ſome worthy praie, wherwith
wée mighte ſtriue to remunerate in
price that gifte of yours: but if peraduenture
you ſurmount vs in the worth
thereof, yet in ſeruitude of loue, you
ſhall neuer ſurmount vs.
               
                  Yours as a brother. &c.
               
            
            
               The anſwere of one Gentleman

               RIght worſhipful, after my heartieſt
recommendations. &c. Greatly am
I ſatiſfied, to haue had occaſion to prouoke
you to write vnto me: for there
are many dayes and monethes paſte,

ſince I haue had any meane to knowe
how you do: it greatly pleaſed me that
our gift ſéemed not baſe vnto you, howbeit
we ſent you not ſo ſmall a preſent
for the deſire to haue it chaunged, but
onely to content the great good wil and
affection of oure mutuall loue. If it
pleſe you to viſite vs this time of Lent
we wil go vnto the hunting for vs prepared.
Thus reſt I.

                        •
                     gne,
and at ſundry times I haue ſente vnto
thée the valure of more than thirtie ſix
thouſand Crownes in diuers ſorts: and
by thine accompt diligētly kept, I finde
to haue receiued of thée but only twentie
thouſande Crownes in chaunge of
Marchaundiſe: afterwardes to haue receiued
of thée in argent about .x. thouſande

Crownes, and of ſixe thouſande
Crownes, I ſee none accompte. True
it is, that I haue ſome vnderſtanding
of the two thouſande Crownes which
Supplicus Gallier oweth: but of the other
foure thouſande whiche remaine,
I can not vnderſtande any particularitie.
I haue ſundry times required accompte
of thée, howbeit thou tourneſt
thy deafe
                     •
                  eare towardes mee: ſo that
thou cauſeſt mée not onely for to haue
great admiration, but alſo greate ſuſpition.
Therefore ſee that thou employe
thy ſelfe to gather vp that, and
euery other accompte which thou haſt
of myne, and lyke a man of credite
come thy waye vnto Paris, for I haue
determined not to trade any more vnto
Barſelonne, where wée haue but ſmal

Letters of the .viij. of Auguſt, I haue
receiued, wherby I vnderſtand the diſpoſition
of your mynde: Pacience we
haue here at this preſente, a Galey of
Gennes, which will depart hence with in
theſe .xiiij. dayes, I will take paſſage
therin to Marſilles, & from thence (God
to friend) I will incontinentely come
vnto you, and will bryng with me all
my bookes of accomptes, by the whiche
you ſhall conferre youre reaſons and

ſomewhat to quiet your minde for the
foure thouſande Crownes whiche you
ſuſpect, within one yere we haue to recouer
two thouſande Crownes of my
Lord Iohn de Louche of Mouſne for it is
a yeare ago, ſince I did credit him with
the ſayd ſumme, bycauſe I had of hym
ſufficient aſſurāce: And for a thouſand
fiue hundreth Crownes, I haue here in
ſundry expenſes for your affaires alredy
diſburſed. I will expreſſe the whole
vnto you by writing, bringing the particular
note of the Spaniſh Silks, that
I ſēt you this moneth of Iuly laſt paſt,

which were .53. pieces. And thus God
preſerue you, and proſper youre affaires.

laſt moneth, that vpon the ſight therof
you ſhould deliuer vnto Sir Sebaſtian
Soiſon, of Mouſne, ſix thouſand ducates,
for ſo much here aſſigned at our houſe:
I pray you deliuer hym the ſaid ſumme
making good payment therof, and ſend
me the example of ſuch writing. Haue
in remembrance howe you deliuer money
vnto any: you know the ſeale that
paſſeth betwene vs: I pray you in any
wiſe ſende me the copies of all the billes
of exchaunge, whiche you haue had
from vs▪ within theſe .vj. moneths, for
here is yet ſome diſcorde. This ſufficeth.
God kepe you. &c.

bicauſe it is expedient to gratifie our
frendes: you ſhal deliuer vnto the bearer
hereof, named Dauid Berthon, viij.
hundreth Frenche crownes: and cauſe
hym onely there to giue good and ſure
pledge for the ſayd ſumme. For ſo hath
the ſame Dauid here promiſed vs to
do, gyuyng him .vj. monethes daye of
payment. I pray you take ſufficient aſſurance,
to the ende that our goodes be
not lightly loſte. It ſuffiſeth to ſhewe
pleaſure, you therefore fulfyll the contentes
hereof. And thus fare you well.

               DEare and well beloued friende, after
moſte heartie Commendations
vnto you, and your good bedfellow. &c.

The chiefeſt cauſe of my writyng vnto
you at this preſente, is to lette you
vnderſtand, that we are ſtill in greate
tribulation, by reaſon of the men of
Armes, and aduenturers, by whome
the poore people of Mouſne, doe ſuſtayne
ineſtimable damage. The countreye
is altogether deſerte: and that
which is alſo more pitifull, is that many
worthie maydens, are by them caryed
away into other places, and ſome
by force violated, as alſo are many
mens wiues bothe faire and honeſte:
Conſider you into what abundaunce of
teares they haue bene brought. O vnfortunate
Fraunce, nowe floriſhinge in
armes: is it poſſible that thy auncient
vertue ſhuld be altogether extinguiſhed?
O my perfect friende, the eternal God
moued me to ſende vnto your houſe at
Bloys, Iane
                   my wife, and my daughter
out of ſo great perill. Yeſterday from
my wife and from my daughter I receyued
comfortable Letters, by the
which I am plainely certifyed, that

that your bedfellowe vſeth vnto them
al curteſie & gentleneſſe. O the eternall
God graunt me life, to ye end that if not
in al, yet at the leaſt in part, I may rē
                  der
ſome recompenſe vnto the benefites
from you receyued: for the which I
am become a great detter vnto youre
goodneſſe. And thus the eternall haue
you al in his keeping, and ſend vs a mery
meeting. &c.
            
            
               The aunſwere of one friende vnto
an other.
               WElbeloued Friend, I heartily recommende
me vnto you, wiſhing
youre healthe and proſperitie euen as
mine owne. &c. Be well aſſured, that ſo
long as I lyue, my houſe and all that I
haue, ſhall at all tymes be at your commaundement
or any of your friendes:
And that ſhall you manyfeſtly knowe
in proceſſe of time: And would to God
that I mighte ſhewe ſuch fidelitie, loue
and charitie towardes you, as at youre
houſe at Mouſne, you diſcouered vnto

me and myne. Thanks be vnto God, we
make good chéere, but certainly I and my
wife doe féele great anguiſh for the loſſe
of our goodes, which through our mutual
amytie we ſuppoſe to be our loſſe:
and aſſuredly we greatly lament alſo
the vexation which you ſuſteyne by the
hands of the Soldiers, wherof we haue
vnderſtanding by your letter. God of his
goodneſſe delyuer you from them &c.
            
            
               One friende vvriteth in a nothers
behalfe.
               ALthough (worthy ſyr) I know that
it is not lauful to moleſt your wiſedome,
in any thing appertayning vnto
Iuſtice: neuertheleſſe to ſatiſfie the dutie
which I owe to this bearer, vnto
whome (through the fidelitie and affection
that is betwene vs) I am bound to
doe euen that which I would doe, if it
were for myne owne cauſe: I therfore
beſeche your worthineſſe, that you will
without delay make a iuſt ende of his
ſute. And ſo doing, I ſhall remayne alwayes

bound vnto you &c.
            
            
               The aunſwere vnto his frende.
               WHat nedeth it yt you ſhould write
vnto me, in the behalfe of him
whome I equally loue aſwell as you?
So great are his vertues, that of euerie
man (of what eſtate ſoeuer he be) he is
worthy to be beloued, and defended: I
beleue yt through his great wiſdome, he
will demaunde me nothing which ſhalbe
againſt the dignitie of myne offyce:
for which cauſe, and for the dutie of Iuſtice
I am boūd to adminiſter vnto him
and euery one fauorable and lawful audience.
But though there were no cauſe
at all, yet thy auncient amitie would
conſtraine me to ayde and fauour him:
for which cauſe be well aſſured, that I
will ſo vſe the matter, that he ſhal plainly
perceiue, that thy requeſtes haue not
ben brought in vayne. &c.
            
            
               To write vnto a Prince in a Priſoners
Behalfe.
               
                  
                  I Haue heretofore cōtinually knowne,
and now at this preſent (more than
euer) do know, of what force true amitie
and frendſhip is, the which conſtraineth
a man to be gētle and amiable, euen vnto
the perſon whome he hateth, therby
to ſatiſfie his frende that entreateth for
him: therfore knowing ye fauour which
your highneſſe beareth vnto me, I dout
not to requeſt you in the behalf of Cleophas
Orillat, who although through his
crymes, he deſerue to receiue no pardon,
yet bicauſe VVilliam Ardiller (of whom
I haue receiued infinit pleſures, and am
bounde vnto him for euer) doeth force
me ſo harde by Letters and meſſangers
(and knoweth certainly what I can doe
with your Maieſtie) yt there ſhold be no
domage done, neither vnto his perſō nor
goods, I therfore moſt hūbly beſech you,
for the ineſtimable loue yt beare vnto
you, yt he may plainely perceiue of what
force & ſtrength that goodneſſe of yours
is towards me, and ſo truſt at this preſēt
to make experiēce of the great affection

which is betwixt vs, through our auncient
and ſingular loue. &c.
            
            
               The aunſwere of the Prince declaring
the demaund to be
vnhoneſt.
               ALthough I haue in times paſt had
perfect intelligence and knowledge,
what thing frendſhip and good will hath
ben and is, ſo that the demaunde of a
friende ought to be ſatiſfied, eſpecially
whē it is iuſt: yet neuertheleſſe it ought
alwayes to be foreſeene, that the demaunde
be honeſt and frendly: For if
the demaunde be made againſt true Iuſtice
and honeſt lyfe, it is nedeful many
tymes to leaue the good will, leaſt we
fail of Iuſtice. Otherwiſe many wicked
examples ſhould be giuen to diuers and
infinite perſons to do euil. I vnderſtand
your Letter, by the which you pray me
that I wold graūt to releaſe your frend
out of captiuitie, not peraduenture conſidering
the great crime & exceſſe by him
cōmitted, the whiche is ſo great and abhominable,

that he deſerueth not death
in his perſon onely, but alſo therewith
cruell tormentes, whereof I am ſory, for
the mutual affection that is betwene vs:
bicauſe I can not of myne honour in
this caſe pleaſure you. Though your demaunde
be not lawfull nor honeſt, yet
loue and frendſhip moueth you to demaund,
and to ſpeake for that which all
law denieth. And for that malefactours
ar to be puniſhed, the good to be exalted,
and ſafely to goe abrode in the world, I
pray you though I doe not ſatiſfie your
demaunde, yet at this time haue me excuſed,
bicauſe that Iuſtice doth force me
to denie that requeſt. &c.
            
            
               The excuſe for that the demaund
vvas againſt Iuſtice.
               
                  I Conſider that many tymes the loue &
affection of one friende vnto another,
harmeth the conſcyence, and ſuffreth it
not to diſcerne the truth of reaſon and
Iuſtice: but when we beholde the eſtate
of men, who by the crimes haue deſerued

all kynde of puniſhments, then is it
nedefull that Iuſtice take place, therby
to giue example to other men from liuing
euil: notwithſtanding I haue done
the dutie which belōgeth vnto a frend.
And although that with ſmal conſideration
and wiſdome I entreated for Cleophas,
yet I beſech your maieſty to excuſe
and pardon me, not ſomuch for mine ignorance,
as for the loue that I bare vnto
my frende, writing in the behalfe of
that tranſgreſſour of true Iuſtice, as
plainly your prudence expreſſeth vnto
me, the which may be an excuſe of my
vnworthie demaunde. &c.
            
            
               To ayde thy frende being in
priſon for de

                  e.
               
                  I Thank God, for that I neuer requeſted
any thing of your Lordſhip, which
you graunted me not, & now I yet hope
to obtayne this, the which is a woork of
pitie. Within theſe few d
                     •
                  yes was impriſoned
Iames Barre, my perfect frende,
who is in ſo much extremitie, that it is

ſcarce able to be expreſſed, and hath a
great ſort of children, for whome he labored
bothe day and night to get bread
to ſuſteyne them: but now being abſent,
your lordſhip may conſider how his pitifull
family ſhould liue. Wherefore I
humbly beſech you, that you would both
for the loue of God, & alſo for my ſake,
open your eares vnto my requeſt, and
giue him ſome day of paiment, in ſuch
ſort that the poore mā may be deliuered
out of priſon, to comfort and relieue his
poore family, the which can not be in
greater calamitie, plaint, and miſery.
And thus hauing ſundry tymes receiued
benefits from your honour, I preſently
am bold by to great preſumptiō, to haue
recourſe vnto you, tēderly beſeching you
that you wold vouchſafe to deliuer him
out of priſon. Thus doing I ſhal receiue
a ſingular pleaſure from your wyſdom.
And ſhall pray for a continuall preſeruation
of you and all yours. &c.
            
            
               
               To shew thy ſelfe ſorowfull for
the miſfortune of thy
friende.
               WE ought alwayes to participate
with our frends of euery fortune
that hapneth vnto them. Hauing therefore
within theſe few dayes had vnderſtāding,
that you were robbed, I receiue
ſuch diſpleaſure and griefe, as of dutie
ought euery good & perfect frend one for
another. But bicauſe I know yt it is not
nedefull to comfort them which are of
them ſelues by wiſdome comforted, I
will not enlarge any further, but onely
deſyre you to haue pacience in ſuch miſfortune,
as requireth your ſingular prudence:
wherunto I commit you &c.
            
            
               The exhortation of a Captaine
vnto his Souldiers.
               ALthough Nature alwayes appoynteth
ſome puiſſant perſon, for neceſſarie
occaſion to gouerne the ſubiect
people in due obſeruance of order, yet

ſynce the tyme that I haue ben amongſt
you in the adminiſtration of warfare, I
do not eſteme my ſelfe your ſuperiour,
but equal, for that no exerciſe hath more
néede of ſkill and counſel, than warfare.
You therfore my ſoueraigne Souldiers
enforce your ſelues with all louing diligence,
to ſubdue and bring downe theſe
barbarous people, not ſo furious as peruerſe,
at all tymes and in all places our
great enimies: For which occaſion in
this warre ſhew your ſelues not onely
frendes and defenders of our King, but
alſo tutours and carefull prouiders for
your ſelues, & preſeruers of your wiues
children, and goods &c.

               COuragious Captain, the celebrated
renoume of wyſdome, prudence, honeſty,

exerciſed by your lordſhip in our time
do inuite & prouoke me to appeale vnto
your preſence, offering thereunto my

whole ſeruice, redie at all times and in
all places. Many men of great fame in
warfare, are at this preſent of me very
well knowne, of all which none of them
in heart, counſell, manhood, nor prudence
may be compared vnto your excellēcie:
therfore all ye true champions of France,
and other men of armes are deſirous to
ſubmit themſelues vnto your lordſhip:
amongſt which number, as one of the
meaneſt, I humbly requeſt to be admitted.
&c.
            
            
               To excuſe thy ſelfe, for being negligent
in writing vnto thy
friende.
               IF in tymes paſt I haue not written
vnto you, as my dutie was, it hath ben
for the vrgent buſineſſe & great affaires
that letted me: yet therefore it is not
but that my whole truſt and fidelitie in
euery kynde of thing hath alwayes remayned
in you: and eſpecially when
I recorde with my ſelf the ſingular loue
which you haue always ſhewed vnto me

in déedes and effectes. And bicauſe it is
better to expreſſe ſome parte of my duetie
late thā neuer, I am moued to write
vnto you theſe preſents, that you may
participate with me of my profit & proſperitie,
as you haue heretofore of my
hindrance and aduerſitie, ayding, coūſelling
and fauoring me, more than euer I
halfe deſerued toward you. &c.
            
            
               To put thy frend in remembrance
of thy buſineſſe.
               ASſured I am that no negligēce hath
at any time kept you backe from ſatiſfying
of my demaūds, which through
your humanitie you haue always reputed
to be your owne: and not onely the
offer which you haue many times made
vnto me, but alſo the experience which I
haue had of you, doeth bolden me now
to write vnto you My vrgent buſineſſe
therfore together conſtraining me, and
knowing that no affaires of myne (for
the loue and affection that you beare
vnto me (ſhalbe accompted troubleſom
vnto you, I now agayne put you in

remembraunce of that whereunto my
buſyneſſe compelleth mée: hoping to be
pleaſured of you, as of him, in whome I
fixe my full truſt & fidelitie in al things,
and who alſo may diſpoſe of me as of a
deere and perfect frende &c.
            
            
               To require ayde at thy frendes
hand.
               THe hope & fidelitie which I haue had
in you, and in the offers which many
times with an effectionate mynde you
haue made vnto me, doeth comfort me, &
moue me in this my buſineſſe and neceſſitie
to haue recourſe vnto you: being
very certain (for the humanitie and affection
that you here vnto me) that your
effectes wil be correſpondent vnto your
wordes, and that you will ayde me with
that which I ſhal demaund: which thing
wilbe very acceptable vnto me, & which
thing alſo you may eaſely graunt me:
for it lyeth aſwell in your poſſibilitie,
to giue it, as in myne to aſke it. And
though my pouertie be great, wherein I
fynde my ſelfe at this preſent, yeat doth

euery man know, that it is not by my
fault, but by the impetuoſitie of fortune
who caſteth downe to ground ech perſō
whom ſhe liſteth: for ſikneſſes, debates,
change of time, and a thouſand contrarieties
(as euery man knoweth) haue
throwē me downe ſo low, that hēceforth
with my .xij. chiloren, I haue more dout
for dyeng of hunger, than hope for to
liue, if your humanitie do not ſuccour
me in this my aduerſitie. And thus I
commit my ſelfe vnto your charitable
pitie &c.
            
            
               To write vnto an Aduocate.
               
                  I Dout not but that your worſhip doeth
accompt me for a negligent man, ſeing
that in a moneths ſpace I haue not writen
vnto you: but certainly no occaſion
cometh vnto my memorie at thys time
more conuenient: than to reaſon by writing
with a ſage and gentle perſon, and
one adorned with vertue: and thus vnderſtanding
myne excuſe, I truſt you
wil be enclined to pardon me. But to the

purpoſe, ſynce your worſhippe departed
from vs, we haue ben more purſued and
moleſted in our proceſſe before the commiſſary,
(who arriued here the day after
your departure) than euer we were
afore tyme: we haue ben theſe .iiij. ſundry
dayes ſore troubled, bicauſe we had
no man to ſpeake for vs: and our aduerſe
partie had Maiſter Iames Parcenall for
his coūſeller. But (not to be troubleſom
by ouer long writing) the whole matter
of the proceſſe depēdeth vntil your comming:
therfore I pray you make ſpedy
returne, and addreſſe your writings orderly.
Thus vnderſtād you our troubles
one houre ſéemeth vnto me a whole yere
vntill your worſhip come vnto vs. We
haue founde the laſt will and teſtament
of our Vncle deceaſſed, the which will
make very much for our purpoſe: we
wait for you here ye wéek after Eſter. &c.
            
            
               To aunſwere thy frend hauing
prayſed thee.
               YOur phraſe of ſpeach is ſo finely adorned
& ſo eloquent, that in veritie
vnto a man euen full of eloquence it

would be troubleſom therunto to make
due and ſufficient aunſwere, therefore
impoſſible vnto me full of barbariſme:
But peraduenture I know not the loue
and affection which you beare vnto me,
for which cauſe although I haue not ye
ornature of ſpeache that were requiſite,
yet notwithſtanding I will enforce
my ſelf for duties ſake, as alſo I truſt to
your contentment, to write you ſome
part of an aunſwere: to the ende that
you myght rather blame me of inſufficiencie,
than of ingratitude or negligēce.
And therfore though I know my ſelf to
haue ben praiſed rather through your humanitie,
for ye ſingular loue yt you beare
vnto me, thā for ye merits of my vertues
yet neuertheleſſe, I cannot chooſe but be
glad & reioice to be praiſed of ſo prudēt a
perſon, & one adorned with ſuch eloquēce
as you are: for your authority is ſo much
in eſtimatiō, yt not only men worthy but
alſo ye vnworthy it beutifieth & extolleth
            
            
               The Replie vnto the ſame.
               COnſidering with my ſelf ye ſmal puiſāce
of my weak ſpirit, & wt what authoritie

of eloquēce it were nedeful and
neceſſarie to ſend you my Letters: I am
as it were aſtonyed, and eſpecially for
the recept of your copious Epiſtles: But
certainly I am not he whome you haue
ſayd to be prudēt and adorned with eloquence,
for therein haue I employde no
labour: But aſſuredly you are worthy
to be called euen eloquence it ſelfe. &c.
            
            
               To shew thy ſelfe thankfull
for a benefit receiued.
               THough at this preſent through the
contrarietie of the tyme, I fynde my
ſelf feeble in the gifts of Fortune, & that
towards you I cannot vſe that renumeration
in effectes which I ought: yet I
truſt you thinke, that my good will is ſo
great towards you, that I haue thereby
fully ſatiſfyed to euery default of my vnfortunate
Fortune. And ſo remain I aſſured
yt through your accuſtomed humanitie,
you wil accept my good wil. But if
euer Fortune (who is mutable) doe returne

hir ſelfe towardes me (as I attende
hir ſwéete daliance) and put hir
proſperous Sayles to mine honeſt intente:
there is not a man in the whole
worlde that more largely ſhall diſpoſe
of me and all my poſſibilities, than ſhal
your wiſdome. &c.
            
            
               The ſame, after an other
maner.
               IF God had ſhewed ſuch fauoure vnto
me, that I had bene as ſufficiente to
haue rewarded ſo many your benefits,
as I féele my ſelfe able and deſirous to
render you infinite thankes, aſſuredly
I woulde haue bene as ready to the ſatiſfaction
of the déede, as of the good wil:
therefore as farre as extendeth at this
preſente my poſſibilitie; I mynde not
to be vngratefull vnto you. And thus
I thanke you for the fame, aſmuch as if
you had done me the greateſt and moſt
ſingular benefite in the worlde, & offer
my ſelfe alwayes vnto you, in all that
ſhalbe poſſible for me. &c.
               Here endeth the third boke.
            
         
         
            
            The fourth boke

belonging to Loue, as
well in Verſe as in Proſe.
            
               Eurialus writeth vnto Lucretia.
               
                  IT is not wythoute
cauſe (Lady Lucrece)
if all they of this citie
haue their eyes fixed
to behold, regard, loue
& praiſe thée: when of
the one part they cō
                  ſider
the great vertues wherwith thou
art enriched, the good & honeſt maners
which adorne thée: and moreouer they
haue in admiratiō thy richeſſe, and yet
more thy nobilitie ſurpaſſyng all other
thy parents. And then whē beſides they
cōſider on the other parte the great, ſingular
& incredible beautie whiche is in
thée, they iudge within thēſelues yt thou
art a very ſpectacle of Natures work,
& are not deceiued: for they viewe thy

Angelicall viſage, ſo fair & cléere, that it
wold lightē a firmamēt altogether cloudie:
thy eies bright, clere & ſhining, like
ij. ſtarres, whoſe ſwéete aſpects driue away
all ſorowe and ſadneſſe, and bring
in place all ioy and pleaſantneſſe: The
faire die of thy pleaſant face, paſſeth all
other liuely colour: thy large forhed, thy
chriſtall neck, thy corall lips, thy goldē
haire, thy comely body, & other mēbres
ſo well proportioned, yt I can not deſiſt
nor abſtaine from praiſing thée, in praiſing
thee to loue thee, and in louing thée
to honor thee. Theſe cauſes with many
modoe conſtraine me to loue thée: and
though nobilitie, richeſſe, and youth he
in me, & alſo (that thanks be vnto God)
I am fortunate inough, yet much more
happy ſhold I be, if it would pleaſe thée
to loue me. For as for my part I am
determined not onely to loue, eſteme,
and honor thée, but alſo to die for thée in
thy neceſſitie, or at thy pleaſure: & I aſſure
thée, that both waking & ſleping, I
haue no thought but of thée: and though
ſome of my companions do ſay, that I

am happy, bicauſe in me are ſome ſmal

my onely hope. Turne therefore (if it
pleaſe thee, my ſwéete Dame and gracious
virgin) thy ſweete eyes of humanitie,
and with clemencie beholde thy
humble Seruitour. O what a thing is
Loue? now doe I know it by experience:
and maruell not though the greateſt
Lordes and Ladies be therevnto
ſubiect: for many willing to obeye his
commaundement, are fallen into great
inconueniences. Remember thee of
Daphne, and of Siringue, of which ye one

And to be briefe, graunt vnto my requeſt,

your abhominable letters and wanton

that they ſhoulde not come vnto the

that ſuch fault is not to be imputed vnto
the letters which are inſenſible, but
vnto the compoſer and doer of them, I
therfore refrayned my ſelfe from that

anger and rigor vpon the meſſanger:
but likewiſe for reporte ſake, I refrayned,
gyuyng hym ſpeciall charge, not

any ſuch meſſage. And to the ende that
you ſhall not preſume to continue any

I am not ſhe, vnto whome ſuch abuſiue

good (contrary to myne accuſtomed maner)
to write vnto you at this preſent,

offence that it feeleth: certifying you,

               The Replie of the Louer.
               HAuing (my ſingular Lady) receiued
your honey ſweete letters, and them
beholding, I finde my ſelfe in ſuch a cō
                  trariety
and diſcord, that my perplexed

thought can finde no waye or meane to
recreate it ſelfe. For of the one part cō
                  ſidering
the wiſe & ſage words of your
ſayd Letters, my heauie heart deſired
to be it owne homicide: and of the other
part ſéeing the thing which your white
and pleaſant hands had touched, ſo much
ioy did abounde in me, that I could not
refrayne nor withdraw my greedie eyes
from ſtill beholding it, nor my reuiued
tongue from often reding it. Yet ſeing
it much moyſtened with the flowyng
floud of my weping eyes: and fearyng
thereby to hurt or teare it, I did moderate
and bridle my ardent appetit, minding
to bear it alwais nigh my hart, in
ſigne of veneration & honor. By your
ſayd letters (my dere & onely miſtreſſe)
you blame me of preſumption, in being
ſo bolde to write vnto you: certaynly if
you conſider wel the maner, you ought
not to impoſe ye fault vnto me, but to at
tribute it vnto youre exceſſiue beautie,
worthineſſe & benignitie, which euē at
their firſt apperance, together ye ſweteneſſe
of your gracious coūtenāce, did ſo

penetrate & enter into al my exterior &
interior powers, & ſo aſſailed hurte and
woūded my afflicted heart, vnprouided
of reſiſtāce, that it is not only robbed &
ſpoiled of al frank & free liberty, but alſo
in ſuch ſort ſubmitted & yoked with
al affectiō, fidelitie minde & thought vnto
ye perpetual contēplation of your excellēcie,
yt I am not able to ſeparate nor
remoue it from yt ſubiection & ſeruitude,
ne yet to reduce it to ye former libertie.
And for yt you ſay, you would haue rent
my letters, & yll intreate the meſſanger
let the continual tormentes (which for
your ſake) teare me in pieces, ſuffiſe to
ſatiſfie your yre, & not diſtain your tender
hāds wt cruelty: & touching yt which
is more greuous & bitter vnto me, that
you cōmand me not to write vnto you,
nor to continue my purpoſe: Know ye
(my deare) ye like as it is impoſſible for
any mā to ſeparate frō you your greate
beautie: euē ſo none other but death can
take a way or diminiſh my purpoſe & intēt,
but euery houre augmenting doth
double it ſelf, together we moſt greuous
anguiſh & ſorow: for reward & remedy

wherof I demaunde none other recompenſe,
but onely that you graunte and
permit me to be your loyal louer and
ſeruitour.
            
            
               A Louer vvriteth vnto
his Lady.
               TO expreſſe vnto thée (my déere) the
inward griefes, the ſecrete ſorows,
the pinching paines that my poore oppreſſed
hart pitifully endureth, my pen
is altogether vnable. For euen as thy
excellent vertue, beautie, comelineſſe,
and curteſie, farre ſurmounteth in my
conceipte, that of all other humain creatures,
ſo my piteous paſſions bothe
day and night are no whit inferior, but
far aboue all thoſe of any other worldly
wight. So excell not thy giftes, but
as much exceede my griefes. Therfore
(my ſwéete) vouchſafe of thy ſoueraine
clemencie, to grant ſome ſpeedie remedie
vnto the grieuous anguiſhes of my
heuie heart, detract no time, but weigh
with thy ſelfe, the ſicker that the pacient
is, the more deadly that his diſeaſe

is déemed: So muche the more ſpéede
ought the Phiſitian to make, ſo muche
the ſooner ought he to prouide and miniſter
the medicine, leaſt comming to
late, his labour be loſt. But what painfull
pacient is hée, that ſuſtayneth ſo
troubleſome a ſtate, as I poore ſoule do)
(excepte thou voucheſafe to pitie me?)
For the partie being diſcōforted at one
Phyſitiās hande, hath recourſe vnto an
other: Where as I diſcomforted at thy
hāds, haue recourſe vnto none, but ſtill
lāguiſhing to looke for a lothſom death.
Cōſider therfore (my dere) the extremitie
of my caſe, & let not cākred crueltie
corrupt ſo many golden giftes: but as
thy beautie and comelineſſe of body is,
ſo let be thy humanitie and clemencie
of minde, drawe not (as the prouerbe
ſayth) a leaden ſworde out of a golden
ſkabberde. And thus hopyng to haue
ſome ſpeedie comfort at thy handes
vpon that hope I repoſe
mée, tyll further oportunitie.

his gripyng griefes, which ſtill encreaſe.
               AS Troylus did neglect the trade
               of Louers ſkilfull lawe,
               Before ſuch time that Creſſeid faire
               with fixed eyes he ſawe:
               So I likewiſe toke litle kéepe
               of loue within my breſt,
               Before I viewde the graces well
               which in you hidden reſt.
               And like as he with furious flames
               was forcibly annoyde:
               So I likewiſe (through force of loue)
               doe lacke that which I ioyde.
               For now my reſtleſſe minde doth raue
               which conſtant was before:
               And ſundry ſtraunge conceits do cauſe
               my griefe t'encreaſe the more.
               Thus farre our fates I may compare
               in all alike to bée.
               God graunt in ſequele I may finde
               ſuch Fortune as did hée.
               
                  
Then ſhall I haue iuſt cauſe to ioy.
               then ſhall my mirth abounde,
               Then ſhall I want no wiſhed happe
               that may on earth be founde.
               Then ſhall my rauings all rebate,
               with conſtantneſſe in place,
               Then ſhall my ſtrange conceits auoide
               my griefe ſhall be ſolace.
               But ſith I lacke ſome ſuch a friende
               as he of Pandor had,
               Who brought his purpoſe well about,
               and made his minde full glad,
               Therfore I ſay for lacke therof,
               my ſelfe now forſt am I,
               My furious flames for to vnfolde,
               and for redreſſe to crie,
               To thée which art the onely ſtay
               of thoſe my troubled vaines,
               Of theſe my ſecrete griping griefes
               of theſe my pinching paines:
               Which long haue boyled in my breſt,
               where they ſuppreſt haue bin:
               But now through force of flame burſt out
               and wil not be kept in.
               Much like to burning Aetna hill,
               whoſe flaſhes neuer ceaſſe:
               
                  
But boyling ſore both night and day
               do freſhly ſtill encreaſe.
               So fareth it likewiſe with me,
               whoſe faithfull heart doth bourne,
               And oft with ſecrete

               Redreſſe wherof may none be had,
               but onely thee deare dame,
               In whome the water doth remaine
               that well would quench the flame.
               Therfore graunt grace, as Creſsida,
               
               did vnto

               For as he had hir loue by right,
               ſo thike to me is due.
               Elſe ſhall I liuing dayly die,
               thus reſt I in thy handes:
               As thou ſhalt pleaſe at libertie,

            A louer pearst with Cupides bowe,

The ſéely ſhip is troubled ſore.
            in daunger of his loſſe.
            So in likewiſe when Cupide hath,
            with dynting Dart in hand,
            Pierſt through the harts of louers true
            as all agaſt they ſtand,
            Before his godhed forced ſtraight,
            downe for to fall and yeld:
            No ſtrugling ſtrēgth may him withſtād
            no buckler nor no ſhield.
            This Cupide he this cruell god,
            with fyry flaming Dart,
            Hath wounded me in euery vayne,
            but chiefly at the heart.
            There doth the ſting abyde and ſtay,
            there doeth the ſhaft remaine:
            All remedie is paſt I know,
            to eaſe me of this payne.
            Except that thou to whom I write,
            true comfort to me ſhow:
            For thou arte onely ſhe that may,
            releaſe me of this woe.
            Thou onely arte (and none but thou)

Deſtroy not him, whom well thou maiſt
            without thy loſſe preſerue:
            Shew faithfull conſtancie to him,
            that myndeth not to ſwerue.
            He nought deſyres but loue for loue,
            and faith for faith againe:
            That both together in great ioy
            and comfort may remaine.
            Detract no time, conſider well,
            when paine doth men oppreſſe,
            Eche houre think they to be twayne,
            till they haue found redreſſe,
            And thus bicauſe my griefs encreaſe,

By ſtory of Pigmalions ill.
            
               I Reade how that Pigmalion was
               A cunning Caruer in his dayes:
               And therein moſt men did ſurpaſſe,
               His worthy works deſeru'd due priaſe.
               
                  
Such was his ſkill to graue in ſtone,
               That like to him was neuer none.
            
            
               This cunning caruer thought in mynd
               Some paſſing péece ſo fyne to frame,
               As worthy were to leaue behinde:
               Thereby to get immortall fame.
               That men might ſay when 
                     〈…〉

               And for bicauſe his cunning great,
               In euery poynt might well appere:
               A woman he would counterfeat,
               (Who of all Creatures is moſt clere.)
               That worthy work might wel cōpare
               With worthy creature, was his care.
            
            
               
                  Pigmalion paſſing paines did take,
               To bring this worthy worke about:
               The which in Marble he did make,
               That lyke was not ye world throughout.
               Eche point

                  o perfect did appere,
               That nought but life thē lacked there.
            
            
               And to be brief, it was ſo wrought,
               That he him ſelf enamoured fell
               
                  
With this fine péece, and ſtill he thought
               She was a lyue, and loued him well:
               And yt ſhe ſmyled with ſmirking lips,
               Thus to and fro his fanſie ſkips.
            
            
               Full oft he kiſt, and braſte alſo,
               This marble mayden, made of ſtone:
               He ſet hir at his table tho,
               And gaue hir meat but ſhe would none.
               The meat ſtil in hir mouth remaind,
               which thing Pigmalion gretly paind.
            
            
               Yet fanſies fond ſo fraught his head,
               With blynde delites of burning loue:
               That he this ſtone layde in his bed,
               And thence could not his minde remoue:
               But oft in armes he can hir cloſe,
               A colde companion I ſuppoſe.
            
            
               Yf thus Pigmalion pynde away,
               For loue of ſuch a Marble ſtone:
               What maruel then though I decay
               With pitious plaint, & greuous grone,
               That loue a liuely Lady bright,
               who hath dame natures points aright
            
            
               
               Oh would I might Pigmalions part,
               In ſome reſpects now fully play:
               Hir to imbrace that hath my hart,
               And ſometimes in my bed to lay.
               I ſhould fynde better paſtime ſure,
               Than poore Pigmalion could procure.
            
            
               But oh I dare not burning breſt,
               Ne lingring loue, to hir vnfolde,
               For feare of further dangers preſt,
               If that the ſame diſdaine ſhe ſhould:
               Therefore with Siſiphus I mone,
               Thus rolling ſtill the reſtleſſe ſtone.

            A louer hath his Ladiees hart,
And writes to hir, as is his part.
            LYke as the valiant Soldier ſtoute,
            when conqueſt he hath wonne
            Reioyceth much (expulſing dout)
            for ſuch a practiſe done.
            Or as the Shipman when that hée,

Or as the Marchant when great toyle
            and trauell he hath had,
            In many a forren countrey ſoyle
            at his retorne, is glad.
            So I lykewiſe whom Cupid ſore
            hath troubled with his warre,
            And toſſed with his raging rore
            of Seas that make or marre:
            With daunger great at length I haue

            Attaynde the thing which I did craue:
            ſo that I ioy much more,
            Than any of the foreſayde ſtates:
            and iuſt cauſe is there why,
            For if I had not had good fates
            right well this know doe I,
            My grief had ben much more than theirs
            with nothing leſſe than death,
            Or liuing elſe in deadly feares,
            whilſt I had ioyde this breath.
            But ſith that all my doutes are paſt,
            I ioy, and ioy againe:
            For that I haue obtainde at laſt
            redreſſe of greateſt payne.
            And you déere dame to whome I write,
            myne onely ioy and ſtay,
            
               
Be glad with me, reuiue your ſpirit:
            as well I truſt you may.
            For though the tyme not yet be come,
            it is not long behynde
            Ere we ſhall ioy the totall ſome,
            and haue our wiſhed mynde.
            Which time when that it come ſhal be,
            I know, and that right well,
            Our ioyes we ſhall then perfect ſée,
            our comfort ſhall excell.
            Then ſhalbe tryde our truthfull harts,
            then ſhall our loue be ſhowne:
            Then ſhal be left our lingring ſmarts,
            then ſhall no griefe be knowne:
            But in the meane tyme faythfully,
            (as doth of right behoue)
            Let eche ſhew other conſtancie,
            with ſtedfaſt fixed loue.
            Let both our myndes together gré

            as though they were but one:
            Sith both our harts ſo fixed bee,
            as can be better none.
            Whereof I dout not, god I take
            to witneſſe at this tyme,
            For I had rather life forſake,
            than chaunce ſhould ſuch a cryme.
            
               
The lyke in you I know doth reſt,
            and ſhall continue ſtill:
            As faithfully you haue expreſt,
            your true loue, and good will.
            Therfore theſe lynes I do not ſend,
            bicauſe I ſtand in dout:
            But onely thereby to extend,
            our faithfull hearts throughout.
            So take it then my heart, my deare,
            who makes my ioyes excell:
            The gods vs guide from douting feare,
            and thus my heart Farewell.
            FINIS.
         
         
            A Louer ſick for very loue,
To pitie doth his Lady moue.
            SIth God doth guide the courſe of man,
            directing all his wayes:
            And ordreth euery lyuing thing,
            as his good will doth pleaſe.
            We mortall men muſt nedes ſubmit
            our ſelues, to gods decrée:
            And looke what fate that he doth ſende,
            therewith content to be.
            
               
Sometimes by health & wealth he doth
            declare his feruent loue:
            And oft againe with ſickneſſe great,
            our veſſels frayle doeth proue.
            As for example, I my ſelfe
            of late his hand haue felt:
            But now at laſt he louingly
            with me againe hath delt.
            Yea Atropos, he had almoſt cut
            my vitall thréede a ſonder:
            Yf th'other Siſters had not ſayd,
            it ſhould continue longer.
            Yea dreadfull death ſtode at the doore,
            and would haue ſtepped in:
            Yf mightie loue, (who ruleth all)
            had not contrary bin.
            Thus haue I toſt the toyling ſtrife,
            twixt lingring life and death.
            Which almoſt had bereft from me,
            this preſent vitall breath.
            Then iudge nothing amiſſe my dere,
            ne let me blamed bée,
            Although in déede of many dayes
            I haue not ben with thée.
            For ſure thou haſt ben ſtill with me,
            and preſent in my mynde:
            
               
Though feble ioynts & lacke of ſtrength
            at home my corps aſſignde,
            So that I could not come to thée,
            as I would faine haue done:
            And as I will by gods grace ſure,
            when I my health haue wonne.
            But in the mean time this ſhalbe
            thée hartily to pray,
            That if thou haue occaſion for
            to come, or goe this way,
            To take the paines to viſit mée,
            with paſſions yet oppreſt:
            For ſure thy preſence will me ioy
            and ſende to me great reſt.
            Thus being bolde now for to craue
            this fauour at thy hand,
            With fingers faynt I finiſh here,
            and ſtill thy ſeruant ſtand.

Doth wepe & wayle, & make great mone
            mans ſenſes ſo to blynde,
            And doth diſſemble much,
            with flattring falſe intent:
            As though great loue, and frendſhip eke
            to him poore man ſhe meant.
            Vntill ſuch time that ſhe
            haue caught him in hir clawes:
            But then alas with bloody téeth
            ſhe kills, where is no cauſe.
            So thou déere dame haſt done,
            (or wouldeſt at leaſt) by mée:
            Not forcing for to hurt thy frende,
            though no iuſt cauſe there bée.
            May I not iuſtly ſay,
            Oh cruell Tygar than,
            What meaneſt thou in raging wiſe,
