VERY FRVTEFVL TREA
               tyse,
teachynge the waye of
Dyenge well, written to a
frende, by the flowre of
lerned men of his

Lupsete
Londoner,

            To dye vvell.
            
               THey say, it is a point of
a prowde vanitie, or a
stubburne foly, to kepe
sure and certaine, whatsomeuer
is ons sayde,
always, it semeth not to wise men,
that a promis shulde be sticked by,
in as moche there maye chaunce
greater causes to breke a promys,
then the reasons be, why promisse
shulde be performed. As if I haue
sayd, that I wyll suppe with you:
hit is not inoughe to bynde me agaynste
all chaunces. I may fall
sycke, I may haue at home some
necessary impediment, the wether
may so fal, that it is no going out,
many casualties may happen, that
were not in mynde, whan such promysse
was made. Wherfore wyse
men say, in all makyng of promes,
there be euer vnderstonde some secrete

exceptions, such as be these:
If I can, If I maye, If it be conuenient,
If no greater cause happen
to let me. By the whiche exceptions,
a promes neuer byndeth a
man ferther, than is accordinge to
be obserued and kepte.
            ¶If I thought (my frende Iohn̄
Walker) that you wold take myne
excuse by the sayde exceptions, I
wold rather by them escape my promesse,
that I haue made to you,
than I wold fulfyl it. For whan I
sodenlye agreed to your requeste,
that was to haue me write to you
the way of dyenge well: I consyderid
not at that tyme, what the
thynge was. After I perceyued
more difficulte in it, then was
mete for my poore witte, specially
beynge (as you maye see me) other
wise occupied, in such studies as

appertayne to my leasure: and of
shortly this lesson to lerne the way
of dyenge well, hath nede to haue
a mayster, the whiche knowethe
both what our life is, and what the
losse of the same is. Nor no man
in mynde can effectuously teache
the way to dye well, excepte he be
one that knoweth the way to lyue
wel. And plainely the mater requireth
a philosophers stomake and a
sadde. For suche a one as Marcus
Cato was, were a man mete to entrete
this thynge: he knewe what
valure ley in deathe, the whiche he
sought bothe with swerde, and his
nayles, tearynge out his owne bowelles.
            ¶I wolde thynke a Catulus or
a Mercula shoulde speake lustely
to you of dethe, seinge they shewed
theyr couragious harte nothynge

to esteme life, when the time required,
eyther to dye with honour, or
to lyue with shame. These men
and suche other wolde shewe you
the waye to go to deathe, longe before
death came to you. But none
of all the paynymes canne eyther
with worde or with ensamples of
theyr actes declare this thynge so
trewly and effectually, as may he
that is exercised in Christes philosophye,
a Paule, or a Peter, or a
Hierom shulde here in speke more
lyuely, than al ye subtyl clerkes of
the olde grekes. Yet to me, for my
parte, it is an harde thyng, eyther
to play with you one of this sorte,
or of that sorte. It passeth my power
to speake to you eyther lyke
Socrates, or lyke Chrysostome.
So that if the sayde exceptions be
with you admittid in a promis makynge,

I may trewely denye you
the performaunce of, my grauntinge,
in as moche when I promised
you this thynge, there was vnderstandyd,
if I coulde, & if it were
conuenient: I nother can well declare
this waye of dyenge, nor yet
me thynke, it is not conuenient for
me, lyuyng in this commen course
of the worldely folke, to speake of
deth so ernestly, as a monke of the
Charter house shoulde and myght
do. But by cause I knowe your
importune desire, to be so set vpon
this thyng, yt nedes you wyll haue
me say somewhat herein: I wyll
praye you so to rede me, as the tale
not onely to be wrytten of me for
you, but that I my selfe am also
an auditor of the same, and as moche
shall I enforce to folowe the
counsayle, that in my sayenge I

aduyse you, as thoughe the hole
worke pertayned only to my selfe.
Wherin take this note for your
comfortes, that I write nothynge
to you, that I wyshe not were in
my owne power to execute. Thus
I with you, and you with me both
of vs fast yoked to gethers, let vs
endeuour our selfes to be in dede
suche men as we commende and
prayse. For as it is shame to speke
one thinge and to thinke an other,
so it is a more shame to write holyly
and to lyue worldlye. And as
great a rebuke there is in him that
can here and praise good sayinges
but doo there after he wyll not.
            Now than let vs not speke only of
the way to dye well, but in effecte
let vs indeuer our mindes to haue
the frute of this lesson, to make in
dede a good ende of our lyfe. And

here nowe withoute any ferther
proces I wyll begynne to pay you
my dette, and shortelye you shall
knowe my mynde howe you maye
dye well.
            ¶As I was bethynkynge me, to
wryte some thyng of this mater to
the satisfyinge of your desyre, I
torned a boke, where my memorie
gaue me, to be a story of one called
Canius, that lyued vnder the tyrante
Caligula Cesar. This Canius
beside his hye lernyng was a
man of a great spirite, the whiche
he wel declared in the maner of taking
his deth. It chansed hym to
falle out for a certayne cause with
the sayde tyrante, and many sore
wordes were betwene them: at the
laste whan the tone was departynge
from the tother, this emperour
in his fierse ire sayde: Well

thou fole, make mery if thou wylt,
for I haue poynted the within few
dayes to be slayne. Therat Canius
turned him with lowe courtesy
and sayd: My most gentill prince
I hartely thanke you.
            ¶This answere came from a noble
stomacke, whereby he shewed
the mad ragis of the cruell tyrant
to be so ferre intollerable, that vnder
hym dethe was to be reckened
for a benefit and a good tourne:
wherfore he thanked hym for his
offer, as for a specyall rewarde.
And great merueil men had to behold
this Philosopher, howe mery
he was after this tyrantes thretenynge.
There were .x. dayes gyuen
of respite, before he shuld dye,
the whiche tyme he so passed, that
he neuer semed to be in lesse care,
nor to haue his mynde in better

quietnes.
            ¶Whan the daye came of execution,
the kinges geyler & hangmanne
wente abowte the towne
with a greatte companye of them
that shoulde suffer death, the whiche
passing by this Canius house,
they called hym to be broughte also
forth amongest the other, at the
whiche tyme Canius was playinge
atte the chestes with one of
his companions, and hearynge
theym make haaste, he rose and
telled his men, sayinge to his companion:
Loke nowe that after my
deathe you lye not, nor make no
false crakes, that you haue wonne
this game. There with also he bekenid
to the gailer and sayde: I
pray you bere witnes, that I haue
one man in this game more than
my felowe hath.
            
               
¶In this wyse this philosopher
playde with deathe, and shortely
his quiete harte gaue a foule
checke mate to the tyrantes crueltie:
he shewed hym selfe to be in
spirite as farre aboue all kynges
violente power, as these myghtye
princes thynke to haue a stronge
dominon ouer all theyr subiectes.
The frendis and familiars of this
philosopher were very sorowfull,
bewaylynge the losse of suche a
man, to whome: what meane you
quod he? Why be you sadde?
            Why mourne you for me? Is hit
not your study to knowe, whether
the soule of man be mortall or immortalle?
The trouthe of this
harde question I nowe shal lerne:
and nowe shall I see the trouthe
of all our dowtes of heuen and
of god.
            
               
¶Thus talkynge with his frendes
he came to the place of execution,
and there a lyttell, whylest
other were hedded, he stode styll in
a musynge dumpte. What thinke
you now good Canius, quod one
of his frendes? Whervpon nowe
muse you so ernestly? Mary (quod
he) I haue determynedde with my
selfe to marke wel, whether in this
short pange of death my soule shal
perceyue and feele, that he goeth
oute of my body. This poynte I
fully entende to take hede of: and
if I can, I wyll surely brynge you
and the reste of my felowes word,
what I felte, and what is the state
of our soules.
            ¶Here was a wonderful caulme
stomake in ye myddest of so stormy
a tempest, this mans mynde was
worthye of an euer lastynge lyfe,

that was not onely to the deathe
studious of knowlege, but also in
the selfe death founde occasion of
lernynge. It was not possyble
for any mannes mynde to contynue
his studye longer, or to a ferther
poynte than this noble philosopher
dyd.
            ¶This story and certayne other
lyke, maken me often to reason
with my selfe, what a strength of
knowlege is in mannes brayne, to
serche and to fynde by hym selfe
the truthe, if he enforce his wittes
to lerne. For this Canius & many
other were not taught of Christe,
as we now be, they had not the rules
of faythe, the whiche shewe
the vndoubtefulle waie to come
to the perfyghte knowelege of all
preuy misteres, they were not comforted
with the preachyng of goddes

sonne to sette lyttel by this life
as we nowe be. They were not
plucked to conceyue a loue of vertue
aboue nature: as the holy scripture
draweth vs from this worlde
to the beholding of an other place,
wher vertu receiueth her crowne.
Wherfore to me hit is no smalle
cause of marueiling, when I here
suche ensamples of naturall men,
that by them selfe coulde in suche
a maner rise aboue theyr nature,
in settynge lyttell by that thynge,
that naturallye euerye creature
mooste abhorreth and feareth (for
deathe is the thynge that in this
worlde by nature is made mooste
doubtfull, moste terrible, most heynous,
and most worthy to be fered,
to be eschewed, and by al meanes,
ways, gynnes, or crafte to be escaped)
To here then a natural man,

without the teching of god, to rise
vp in his phantasie aboue nature,
to iudge of death farre other wyse
than nature teacheth hym, to dispise
the durance in this lyfe, when
he knoweth no certaynte of none
other worlde, to vse the strength &
myght of the spirite ageynste the
puisant power of all tyrantes: It
semeth to me a wonderful thynge,
& more wonderfull the same shuld
be, if I sawe not written in holy
scripture, howe that frome the
fyrste creation of Adam, the goodnes
of god hath ben so greatte towarde
mankynde, that he hathe
gyuen vs alway sufficiente grace,
to knowe the ryghte, to se the hye
maiestie of vertue, to fynd out the
trewe dignite of the soule, to perceyue
the vanyte of this presente
lyfe, and fynally to vnderstonde

wherin stondethe the pleasure of
god, and wherin standeth his displeasure.
Euer by goddes mere
goodnes man knewe what was
well to be done, and what was contrarye
yuelle to be done. It is a
lawe written in the harte of man
with the fynger of god in our creation,
to be enduced by reason to
praise alway vertue, and to thinke
synne worthye of disprayse. The
mynde of man hath a grace to see
farther than the bodye syghte can
attayne to, the mynde of man feleth
more subtyllye than our fyue
wyttes can aproche to, the losse of
bloudde or of breth is a smalle trifell
in the myndes consideration,
when the mynde vsethe his owne
clere syghte, and is not blynded
with the darkenesse of the bodye,
the whcihe stomblethe atte euerye

strawe in this worlde. Euery mot
choketh a worldly man.

                  an. Euery litel
sownde maketh a worldly man

man him that giueth al his care
to vse his wittes in this worlde,
that creapeth vpon suche thynges
as be sene, harde, felte, tasted, and
smelte, that clymeth not in no consideration
aboue the myste of this
valeye. The mooste parte of men
euer haue bene of this weake sorte
and yet stylle the mooste parte of
men is the same. This worlde euer
hathe his multitude, that honoreth,
worshippeth, and magnifieth
nothynge besyde this shorte
lyfe, and those thynges that pertayne
to this lyfe. Yet ageyn euer
hath there benne some and stylle
there be some, that playe the philosophers,
the whiche studied

to knowe the dignities and worthynesses
of euery thynge, howe
moche it shoulde be estemed, valurid,
or regarded of vs, the whiche
labourith to pycke oute in euerye
thynge what is good and what
is noughte.Spirit
                     •
                   men. Men of this sorte
be called spiritualle menne. For
you muste knowe, that a tayllour,
a shomaker, a carpenter, a
boote man, withoute bothe learnynge
and orders, maye be spirituall,
whenne a mayster of arte, a
doctour of diuinitie, a deane, a bishop
bothe with his cunninge and
dignities may be temporall, seing
the trewe diffinition of a spiritual
man is to be one, in whome the
mynde and spirite chefelye ruleth.
Lyke wyse the temporall man is
he,Temporall me
                     •
                  
                  ▪
                in whome this present tyme of
this traunsitorye lyfe hath mooste

rome. Thus I saye spiritualle
men haue euer sene the trouthe,
to ponder and valure euery-thyng
in this worlde accordyngely. And
as to the temporalle mynde nothynge
semeth sweter than to lyue
here, so the spiritual mynd fyndeth
swetenes in deathe, by the whiche
this lyfe endeth. For lyke as the
prince of this worlde neuer agreethe
with god, nor yet the bodye
with the soule, nor the erthe with
heuyn: so he that studieth for this
tyme, hath clene contrary opinions
to hym that foloweth the spiryte.
And as the temporalle man
saythe, hit is a pleasante thynge
to lyue here, and a bytter thynge
it is to dye: so the spirituall man
thynketh it a bytter time to indure
the space of this life, & moch ioy he
conceyueth by the ryddance of the

soule from the heauye burden of
this body.
            ¶Of these contrarye opinyons
yo ushall lesse maruayle, when we
haue a lyttell considered the thyng
it selfe, what shoulde be death, the
whiche one parte of vs so moche
feareth, and an other sorte setteth
so lyttell by the same: and so by a
shorte processe you shall see, whether
the sayde Canius be more
worthy of prayse for his lyttell regardyng
the deedly punyshement
than is Frances Philippe,Franci
                     •
                   Philip. that
within fewe yeres passed was put
to execution with vs for treason,
the whiche dyed so cowardelye, in
soo greatte panges of feare, that
he semed extracte from his wittes,
scante for quaking and trymbling
the wreche coulde speke one word.
The fewe wordes that he coulde

with moche stutterynge sownde,
were only in the declaration of his
dispayre, nor nothynge was sene
nor harde of hym, but wepynge,
lamentynge, wryngynge of his
handes, with bannynge the houre
and day of his byrthe, contynually
sighinge, as thoughe his harte
shulde haue burste for sorowe.
            The difference of these affectes
wyll hereafter be (I thynke) playner
to you, whan we haue a lyttell
more spoken in this matter. For
nowe good Iohn̄, I wyll crepe a
lyttell nygher to your desyre, the
whiche you haue, of lernynge the
way to dye well.
            ¶THIS DIENGE well is in
effecte to dye gladlye.
                  
                     •
                  o dye 
                     •
                  yll. For who so
euer dyeth gladlye, he departethe
frome this lyfe in a sure hope to
lyue ageyne, beynge nowe wery

of this worlde: but nother this
hope of the lyfe to come, nor this
werynes of the lyfe presente, can
make in any man a glad harte to
dye. Onles he be one that hath liued
well here. For in death there
can be no gladnes, excepte therbe
a full truste of opteynynge the rewarde
of vertue, partelye by the
truste and fayth of a good mynde,
partely by the mercye of god, that
fulfilleth euer our insufficiency, yf
we bring ought with vs worthi of
his fauour. For goddes grace supplieth,
where our power lacketh,
if hit so be that our soules appere
before him in an apparell mete for
his presence, the whiche apparelle
requireth a perfecte faith, and an
ernest wyl of doing wel, al though
we haue not alwaye done well.
            The mercye of god neuer failethe

hym, that fully trusteth in it: But
a full truste, can not be withoute
the strength of charite, the whiche
euer burneth in the loue of doinge
good: & faithe can not be perfect,
onles there be good workes, ye whiche
maye stur vp and quycken in
vs faythe to take a beleue, that by
Christes actes our final demerites
may growe to be perfecte. Thus
a chereful harte, beset with fayth,
hope, and charitie, taketh no pensifulnes
in the remembraunce of
deathe, but rather it reioysethe to
remembre, that by deathe it shall
passe to lyfe, neuer more to dye.
            Wherfore to dye well euer, is to
dye gladly, eyther to be ridde from
the bondes of this prison, or to opteyne
the lybertye of heuen: bothe
wayes commeth from a good lyfe
passed: so that surely no man can

dye well, that lyueth not well, for
euer deth is a sorowfull thynge to
the yuell lyuer, by cause he hathe
nothynge to laye before the mercy
of god, whervppon he maye take
hope and truste to be made worthy
of the sure lyfe, in the whiche
deathe medleth not. Nowe than
yf we can gether, what maye lette
vs to be gladde of deathe, and
what wyll brynge vs to a desire of
dyenge gladlye, we shalle by the
same pycke oute the waye to dye
well. For in my mynde these .ii. be
allwayes one, to dye well, and to
dye gladly.
            ¶The gladde desyre of dyinge is
letted chefely by two thynges:Two l
                     •
                  
                  tes to d
                     ••
                   gladly. one
by the feare of deathe, the tother
by the loue of this lyfe. The tone
of these foloweth the tother. For
he that loueth this lyfe, feareth to

dye: and he that fearethe to dye,
loueth this lyfe. Yet we may speke
of eche parte by him selfe, and first
lette vs assaye the greatteste, the
whiche is the feare of death: than
nexte after we will come to the tother,
the which is the loue of this
lyfe. If these two blockes be taken
out of our stomakes, we shall
fynde an easye and a playne waye
to the ende of our pourpose. For
who someuer nother fereth to die,
nor loueth to tary in this lyfe, he
is redye alwaye to dye gladdely.
But to performe my promis, lette
me say somwhat of the sayde feare
and loue.
            ¶Fyrste and chefely the feare of
death takethe awaye all gladnesse
of dyinge, and therby after myne
opinyon, no man that dyeth ferefully
can dye well: so that to lerne

the waye of dyenge well we muste
lerne the way to die without feare.
And yet howe I shulde proue, that
death is not to be feared, I canne
not well telle, seinge the hole power
of nature sheweth, that of all
thynges death is moost fearefull:
and to reason ageynste nature, it
were parauenture not soo harde
as vaine. For what canne reason
preuayle, if nature resiste? It is a
thynge to farre aboue mans power
to stryue or to wrastelle with
nature, her strengthe passeth the
myghte of our wyll, what helpe
someuer we take of reason or of
auctoritie: nother counsayle nor
commandement hath place, where
nature dothe her vttermooste. It
is none excuse to saye, that menne
feare deathe bycause they be lothe
to leaue the commodities of this

lyfe, or by cause they feare the threteninges
of purgatorie and of hel,
or els bycause they thynke apon
the sore paineful panges, the whiche
be in the tyme of deathe. Nay
these thinges make not chefely the
feare of dying, it may well be that
of suche thynges the feare is increased
and made more fulle, but
there is a feare byfore and bysyde
all these thynges, the whiche
feare nature (I say) gyueth, as it
is wel sene in yonge chyldern, that
haue no remembraunce nother of
this lyfe, nor of the deadely panges,
nor of heuen, purgatorye, or
helle. Whan we in sport threten to
caste them heedlynge out at some
hye wyndowe, they quake, trymble,
and ware pale, shewyng playn
and euident tokens of a naturall
feare towarde dethe. And though

by lernynge, or by a curragious
mynde, somme fewe amongest vs,
seme lyttell or nothynge to be moued
with dethe: yet thensample of
these fewe can not take awaye the
trouthe, that nature in all the reste
worketh. For howe many be there
that onely to eschewe deathe suffre
all wretchednes, all beggarie, all
payne▪ in pyckynge vp crommes
of nouryshement to abyde a while
in this lyght: And the more shamfully,
that men for the moste parte
feare to dye, the greatter proffe
there is, that suche extreme poyntes
of fere agaynst all shame shuld
not in so many daily appere, whan
dethe approcheth, onles by nature
some iuste feare were of the same.
For as the excesse of feare cometh
by weakenes of harte and lacke of
stomake, the which is worthy to be

rebuked for shamefull cowardnes:
so there is a meane measure offere
in dethe, that may be reckened honest
and iuste, bycause nature maketh
it necessary.
            Loke you howe bothe olde and
newe stories kepe in memory their
names that appered to dye without
feare: as who saye, it is to be
wrytten for a wonder and lyke to
a myracle, beinge a thynge besyde
the course of nature, to here of a
man that can in deathe ouer come
the passion of feare, as we wonder
to here of some that lyue withoute
sustinance of meate or of drynke.
Bycause I saye hit is a naturalle
thinge to feare dethe, we greattely
meruayle of them that feare it not.
Yet reason saythe, we shoulde not
feare that thynge, the whiche we
know not, & only yuel is worthy to

be feared. But seinge we knowe
not dethe, we may well by reason
doubt, whether it be yuell or good.
And nowe before we speake anye
more of feare, let vs a lyttell consyder
dethe by it selfe, what thyng
it is of his owne nature, and whether
by it selfe it be good or yuell.
            ¶We calle ones dethe the losyng

What de
                     ••
                   is. the soule from the bodye: the
whiche departyng no man can escape,
but necessarilye dye all we
muste that be borne in this worlde.
When the body by any violence loseth
his sensis, and is spoiled from
the quicke vse of his principal partes,
than departeth the soule from
hym: and in maner the bodye leaueth
the soule, before the soule leauethe
the bodye. For it is not the
soule by hym selfe that goeth from

the body, but it is the body by his
forsakynge lyfe, that causethe the
soule to departe. For where lyfe is
not, there the soule canne not abyde:
and as the body is liuely before
the soule entereth, so the same
dody is deadly before the soule departeth.
Bloudde in his measure
and temperance betwene cold and
hotte, kepeth lyfe in the body: the
which bloud by innumerable wais
of chanses may be altered and constrayned
to leaue his nouryshyng,
whervpon shall insue the losse of
lyfe, and than streighte after foloweth
the soules goinge away. For
well you knowe, that the soule is
one thynge,
                  
                     •
                  he soule. and lyfe is an other.
Wheresomeuer the soule is,
                  
                     •
                  he lyfe. there
is lyfe. But it is not trewe, that
where someuer lyfe is, there is the
soule. For trees and herbes haue a

parte of life, and a more parte of
lyfe is in muskylles, oysters, and
wormes: yet a more perfect lyfe is
in these bestes and birdes, the whiche
haue amongeste theym some
more some lesse of lyfes perfetnes.
But thoughe in theym lyfe, the
whiche resteth in the vse of the sensis,
that be to here, to see, to fele, to
smelle, to taste, and in swyfte mouynge
is a great worke of lyfe, the
which thynges I say, though they
be in the perfection amongist these
beastes: yet the hande of god hath
not gyuen to any creature lyuyng
in the erthe water or ayre, to haue
besyde lyfe a soule: the whiche is a
thynge formed after his lykenes,
sauynge onely to man, whome he
hath putte here to rule ouer thynges
created, lyke as he reuleth in
heuen ouer al. It is the creatours

wyl, that nothynge in this worlde
shall haue a soule, but man alone:
the which soule bringeth with him
the vse of reason, a thynge that
may teache vs bothe that we haue
a soule, and that god is he the whiche
hathe thus made vs to be in
this worlde his chiefe and mooste
excellent creature. Reason dothe
thus teache vs, yet besyde reason
we be herein better instructed by
our mayster the son of god, so that
nowe we can not doubt, that in vs
is a thynge, the whiche canne not
dye. But of suretie we euidently
se, not onely by reason, but moche
better by belefe, that the ymage of
god in vs is perpetuall & can not
not feale any corruption, oneles
suche as our frowarde wyll maye
gyue, wherof groweth synne, that
is the lyuynge dethe of the soule.

But lette vs comme to our mattier.
            ¶To speake of this bodyly deth
we nowe haue a greatte fordell in
comparison of some olde clerkes,
that were in doubte, whither there
was in man any soule besyde lyfe,
more than is in an horse or a gose.
They were in doubt whether any
thynge of manne remayned after
dethe, that myght fele or perceyue
eyther ioy or peyne. For as to the
faynyng poetes, that spake of delicious
gardins for good spirites,
and of dyuers sore turmentes for
vngracious sowles after this life,
most part of the olde clerkes gaue
no maner of credence: and they
that beleued other an heuen or an
hell, to be ordeyned for mens sowles,
yet they so beleued, that moch
doubtfulnes was in theyr belefe,

in asmoch as their reason suffised
not to fynde oute the certeyntie of
goddis workes. From the whiche
doubtis the vnfallible doctrine of
Christe hath now delyuered vs al,
so that as many as wyll gyue eare
to the voyce of god, they can not
mistruste their knowlege, but that
without question bothe we haue a
soule, and the same soule is immortall,
a thynge that neyther in
this worlde nor out of this worlde
can peryshe or feale any poynte of
deth, to lacke by the same any iote
of his beinge. I saye oure soules
contynually without ende shall euermore
endure, the which be created
and made by god after the
forme of god. What fourme that
is, it is as harde to shew as it passeth
our capacitie to knowe what
god is, whose shappe and facion

our soules beareth.
            ¶Nowe than what shall we saye
of dethe? the whiche by hym selfe
is not vnlyke to an endles slepe of
the bodye, wherof the bodye lyeth
without power to vse anye sence,
beynge after lyfe lyke to a stone,
that neuer had lyfe.Wheth

of the bodies state, whether by hit

harde thyng for vs to iuge, seing
the trowth is, that no man lyuing
expertlye knoweth what thynge
deathe is: and to determyne of a
thynge vnknowen, hit semeth a
presumption full of folye. Therfore
without any certayne determination,
we maye for oure lernyng
debate with reson the thing,

shoulde be no trespace for one man

in gyuynge to other a good thyng

thynge, can be no rebuke. Where
the dede is good, there is well doynge
in the doer: But euer, not
onely by Christes teachynge, but
also by natural reson manslaughter
hath bē iuged an abhominable
synne. Wherfore it canne not be,
that by hym selfe death is a good
thyng. And ageyne an yuel thing
it is not.

that vertue shoulde be praysed in

holye marters, the whiche couragyouselye
toke vppon theym the

be the naturalle ende of mannes
course in this life, if it were a thīg,
by it selfe nawght. For yuell magrye
mans hedde, is neuer put to

is constrayned to suffre.Death

                   yuell. Therfore
it semeth true, that death considered
alone by hit selfe, is nother
good nor yuell. But when we here
of dyinge wel or dying yuell, or of
a good deathe or an yuel death: it
is not deathe by it selfe that is spoken
of, but rather the circumstances,
the maner, the fashyon, the
cause of deathe, or that goeth before
death, or that foloweth dethe.
These be the thynges that gyueth
and taketh this name of goodnes

or yuelnes, As to saye that death
is good, by cause hit endethe this
synnefull lyfe, and is the meane to
passe frome this worlde to heuen:
or els when we saye, that Iudas
dyed an yuel death, it is not ment
that the departing of Iudas soule
from the bodye was yuell, but the
maner of his dyeng, was the yuel
thynge, his cursed desperation, his
dampnable mystruste of goddes
mercye, his dispitefull refusynge
grace, made his deathe yuell. The
two theues, he at the ryght hand,
and he at the lefte, bothe dyed one
kynde of deathe, bothe nayled to
crosses, both worthy for their trespaces:
yet it is trouthe, that the
tone died wel in a good deth, the tother
dyed naught in an yuel deth,
not for the dethe by it selfe, wherin
was no difference, but for the diuersitie

of their .ii. myndes in takynge
of deathe. The tone repented
hym, and asked mercy, wherof
he died graciously, the tother contynued
in his blasphemynge god,
the whiche stubburne stomacke in
synne caused hym to dye vngraciously.
It is a thynge that foloweth
dethe, and is not in dethe it
selfe, whervpon we loke, when we
iuge to be a good ende or an yuel.
For by the maner of hym that dyeth,
we coniecture the state and cō
               dition
of the soule: the whiche yf
we fynd in our fantasie to be in an
yuelle case, as in the daunger of
goddis curse, we call deathe yuel,
wherby the soule passed to come to
suche sorowe. And contrarye, yf
we thynke the soule to be in the fauour
of god, or to be redye to take
mercy, we call deth good, the whiche

conueyde the soule to his blys.
So that by it selfe deathe remayneth
indifferent to be iudged of diuers
considerations, other a good
ende or an yuel ende.
            ¶Nowe than we may here say, he
that feareth deathe,o feare ath. sheweth hym
selfe to be in doubte of his soules
state, or els to be certayne that his
soule is in goddis curse. The whiche
ferefull mynde is in them that
haue so passed this presente lyfe,
that eyther they haue doone nothinge,
wherby they may hope to
be rewarded in heuen: or els they
haue done so vngratiously, that
they can haue no trust of escaping
damnable punyshement, specially
yf he be a christened man. For yf
he be not christened, and feareth to
dye, he declareth hym selfe to haue
none hygher thought of lyfe, than

the dumbe beastes haue, the whiche
make by the lawe of nature so
moche of their lyfes, that they can
mynde nothynge besyde, and the
losse of their bloode maketh with
them an hoole conclusion of their
beinge. Wherfore beastes may iustly
flye and feare deathe, as the
worste thynge that can happen to
their state: but a man dothe hym
selfe to moch wronge, if he thynke
hym selfe in no better condicion
than be these beastes. It is not in
the dyuels power to do manne so
great hurte as this false imagination
doeth. And surely vnworthy
he is to haue in hym the power of
vnderstandynge, of thynkyng, of
prouydynge, of lernynge, of teachyng,
of diuisyng, of remēbringe,
of louyng, of hatyng, of resonyng,
of counsaylynge, of infinite moo

gyftes, who someuer iugeth hym
selfe to haue no more than a swyne
or an ape hath: Loke as by the fiue
wittes the body knoweth this or
that: so by these powers of mynd,
the soule walkith to his vnderstandynge,
and of an heuenly mattier
is made this marueylous thynge,
that dwelleth in mans body for a
tyme, to be made worthye other of
euerlastyng lyfe, or of euerlasting
dethe, for the damned soule lyueth
in deth without ende.
            ¶But yet what shall we saye to
the place we left before,
                  
                     •
                  eathe is

                     •
                  eared. that naturally
death is feared? Let it be the
workynge of nature, yet I see not
but the strength of mannes minde
fully fastened in fayth, may victoriousely
ouer come all this feare,
as we fynde manye ensamples of
men that so haue done, not onelye

of theym that haue benne helped
with faith, but also of many paynymes,
the whiche toke a courage
to dispise deathe, only of a mighty
and valiant minde to haue reason
subdewe in them the power of all
affects.
            ¶I fynde, a lernedde paynyme
wrote that we shoulde nother care
for lyfe by it selfe, nor yet for death
by it selfe. He sayth that we shulde
care to lyue well and to dye well,
and let lyfe and deathe passe without
care. For lyfe is not good, but
to lyue well is good.
            ¶If paynymes haue this ryghte
consideration of lyfe and of death,
what shame is hit for Christened
men to care for death? seing Christ
whose wordes can not but be true,
so vehemently forbyddeth vs the
same, that paynymes sawe by reason

to be done. Ageyne, seyng this
death is so common a thynge dayly
in our syghte, why shoulde we
we feare it. Thinges that syldom
chanse may sturre vp by their rarenes
great feare: thynges that be
euer at hande shulde by theyr famylartytie
and custome nousel vs
to sette lyttell by theym. Farthermore
he that feareth death coming
to hym, wolde feare by lykelyhode
deathe, if hit coulde be with hym,
when deathe is suche a thynge,
that other it is not yet come, or els
it is paste. For no man can saye,
that deathe is presente. So this
feare can neuer be ioyned with the
thynge that is feared. Ageyne that
thynge that euerye man maye do,
no man lightly doeth, that thinge
that no man canne helpe hym selfe
in, that for the most parte all men

do. No man almooste studyeth or
careth howe well he may lyue, but
how longe he may lyue euery man
museth, when the trouth is, that it
myghte of all men be opteyned to
lyue well, and no man can further
hymselfe to lyue longe. A lyke frowardnes
is in our remembraunce
of deathe, we busilye labour and
enforce to dreame of deathe, the
whiche thynge we can not do: we
myghte fynde the waye to dye wel,
and this thynge we wyll not doo.
This madnes Iohn̄ I truste, you
wyll put of, and feare not deathe,
the whiche you canne not escape:
But feare an yuell death, the whiche
you may flye.
            ¶Amonge manye commodytes
of deathe I reken one chefely to be
sette by, that it is good to dye wel,
to escape therby thoccasion of lyuinge

yuell, and surelye he dyethe
well, that for suche an intente taketh
death gladly.
            ¶More ouer consider you well,
and you shall see, that in hym the
whiche is curious to lyue, fortune
hath a great rule, but in hym that
can dye gladdely, fortune hath no
power. And what a wretchednes
it is to be vnder fortunes vanitie,
I reporte me to them, whome we
beholde dayly diuersely vexed as
well with immoderate lustes of to
moche welthe, as with passynge
sorowes of to moche trouble.
            Therfore to be oute of fortunes
thraldome sette lyttell by this lyfe,
that is to say, feare not deathe.
            ¶It pleased me to rede a paynyms
opinion, that sayd, He is as
foolyshe that feareth deathe, as he
that feareth to be olde. For as after

yōge age folowith the old: so after
old age streight foloweth deth.
And a madde mans poynte it is to
feare dethe, seinge thinges vncerteyne,
the whiche may chance and
may not chance, be onely worthye
of feare, but thinges certeyn without
doubte commynge, muste be
loked for, not feared. The necessitie
of deathes commyng is equall
and without remedy, so that other
to complayne, or to flye at deathe
hit is a playne madnes. For who
can complayne to be in the condicion,
in the whiche indifferently al
men of this worlde be?
            ¶And agayne yf the payne of dienge
were a thinge to make death
fearefull, fyrst it shulde be a comforte
to remembre, that after the
peyne of deathe, there shall be no
more peyne, and as Epicure saith,

If it be an extreme soore payne, it
is shorte. For no vehement peyne
can be longe. This were inoughe
to make death not moche to be cared
for. Euery way deth is a thing
neuer to be feared of a wyse man,
and neuer to be out of mynd both
with good men and wyse men.
            And as for the feare of death were
not he (I pray you) a starke foole,
that wold wepe and wayle bicause
he was not born to this lyfe a thousande
yeres agoo? no lesse a foole
is he who so euer soro with bicause
he can not lyue a thousande yeres
to come. For these .ii. sayinges be
euen and equally true: you were
not, you shall not be. So that one
mynde shulde be in vs, as well to
remembre we shall not be, as to remembre
we ones were not. It is
no newe thyng to dye, our fathers

our grantfathers, our great foresiers
be gone the way, that both we
shal go, and al that folow vs must
come the same.
            ¶More ouer in as moche no labour,
wyt, craft, nor diligence preuayleth
to escape dethe, no power,
no ryches, no auctoritie helpeth,
but all indifferentely be called of
dethe, all without choyse must folowe
the trayne of deathe, no corner
can hyde vs, no walles can defende
vs, no waye nor meane, no
intreatie, no prayer, no suite, nothynge
vnder heuen can kepe vs
from deathes hande. Let vs than
take a lusty courage of this desperation,
seinge there is no remedy:
lette vs manfully go to it.
            The most fereful and cowarde bestes,
that of nature be made to fly,
when they be dryuen in to suche

straytes, that they can rounne no
further, they▪ turne them, and with
the power of theyr myght they inforce
to escape.

                  essitie. And surely it is euer
sene, that those ennemyes be
euer moste terrible, the whiche be
dryuen by extreme force to fyghte.
For necessite correcteth and chastiseth
our hartes moch more sharply,
than vertue can do. Wherof a
desperate mynde shall do greatter
actes, or at the leest no lesse than a
valiant stomake can doo. In this
necessitie of dethe we nowe be all,
it is vayne for vs to flye or to ron
away, our feare can fynd no place
of flyght. Lette vs imagine the
trouthe as in dede it is, that we be
al betrayed to dye. It is so Iohn,
that without doubt we be all kept
in a streyte corner to be rydde of
this lyfe. There is no hope of remedy.

All this people that you se,
howe longe thynke you shall be.
It shall not be longe, but all shall
by the course of Nature be called
hens to dethe, and there hydde. It
maketh no force neither of the day
nor of the place. There nedeth no
question to be asked eyther where
or whan, al must come to one end,
other soner or later, other before or
after? What nowe Iohn? dothe
not he seme vnto you a shamefull
cowarde, and a fearefull wretche,
a playn kikkes without an harte,
that with moche intercession, with
many prayers desyrethe a lyttelle
delaye of deathe? If you sawe

most instant suit to the hangman,
that he might be ye last that shulde

you not say, fye vpon such a wretched
knaue, that so moche feareth
deathe, beynge nowe at the poynt
to dye, whether he wylle or no?
and yet this maner nowe is with
vs all. For the mooste parte it
is greattely valured with vs to

is so nygh deathe by age, that desireth
not to differre from this day
vntyll to morowe, when in trouth

to suffer a freshe. Feare of deathe
was soo farre frome his mynde,

lyfe, they shoulde opteyne an other
lyfe, where their ioy shuld neuer
haue nother change, nor decrease,
nor ende. Therfore my good Walker,
mystruste you not Christe,
whose doctryne the heuen and the
erthe hath by innumerable myracles,
this many hundreth yeres approuyd
and confyrmed to be trew,

the bloude of so may sayntes haue
witnessed the same: and the diuels
with all the damned spirites, soo
surely beleue the trouthe of Christes
teachynge, that they trymble
and quake thereat. Be not moued
with the common ensample of the
hole worlde, though both spirituall
and temporall men, though the
pope with all his cardinalles byshoppes
and prestes, thoughe the
princes with all theyr gentylmen
and subiectes mangnifye, esteme,
loue, noryshe, and by all meanes
cheryshe this lyfe, yet beleue you
the trouth, and thinke al the world
false, where Christes sayinge agreeth
not with that the world doeth.
If it were possible, that you sawe
the angels of heuen lyue contrary
to the preachynge of Christe, yet
ageynste them all beleue the sonne

of god, and loue not to abyde in
this lyfe, when Christe calleth you
hense, make a smale valure of this
present plesures, whā Christ sayth
all be vanites, & may be torned to
endles sorowes: Regarde no honour,
no promotion here, when
Christe sayth, the place of honour
is in heuen, and here is none aduācement,
that is not both shame,
and also may be cause of a perpetualle
wretchednes. Dispice the
ease and rest that these riches bringeth,
in as moche Christe saythe,
that of them be taken many impedimenntes
and lettes to enter
into the sure quietnes of blessed
soules. Thynke no place to be for
your abydyng in this world, when
christe sayth, here is not your coū
               trey,
but your father and your
dwelling place is in heuen. Haast

therfore hence. This is to saye be
wyllynge to forsake this straunge
countray. And seinge the waye to
your homewarde lyeth by deathe,
take a couragious stomake to die,
and dye gladly, that you may dye
well. Beleue I say Christe, & you
shall thynke it paynefull to be in
this lyfe. Beleue Christe and you
shall be gredye to be partaker of
the heuenly ioyes, whervpon wyll
folowe a plesante remembraunce
of deathe, by the whiche you shall
departe frome your peyne to that
ioye, the whiche you desyre. And
hereof is made a glad dyinge, the
whiche I styl name a good dieng.
Thus if we canne take this feare
awaye we be well forwarde, and
herof wyll easyly insue the reste,
that is to dye gladlye. It is a true
sayinge, that who so euer feareth

death, he shal neuer do a dede worthy
for a lyuyng man. Therfore if
hit were but onely for lyfes sake,
it is our parte to despise the feare
of deathe.
            ¶Besyde this feare of deathe,Loue this ly
                     ••
                  
                the
loue (I say) of this lyfe soore hyndereth
the gladnes of dyinge, no
man dyeth gladly, that estemethe
moche this lyfe. He that rekeneth
in this worlde hym selfe happye,
when he hath gotten ryches, possessions,
auctoritie, promotion, a
ryall state, a princelyke courte, abundaunce
of welthy fare, a rule
and power bothe to auaunce his
frende, and to vndo his foo: this
man I say that glorieth in his fantasye
for these and such other thinges,
can not but with moch sorow
depart hence. To this mās hart ye
remembrance of deth is a euer greuous

thoughte, his mynde canne
not but lament whan he seeth the
necessite to be pluckid and drawen
frome these commodities, in the
whiche resteth the ioye, pleasure,
and gladnes of his mynd, he hath
so stedfastly accustomed hym selfe
to take this worlde for heuen, that
it wyll not synke in his brayne, to
hope of an other heuen: he hath so
corrupted his taste with thinkyng
this lyfe to be swete, that nedes it
must be a bytter thyng to make an
ende of all his pleasures, and in
this case be not onely they that
haue this worlde at their wyll, but
also they be in the same case that
haue naught, and be gredy of hauynge.
As moche loueth he this
worlde that wolde fayne be ryche,
as he that is ryche. It is nat the
hauynge nor the lackyng of abundance

in goodes, that maketh a sorowfull
hart in the remembraunce
of dethe, but it is the mynd that valureth
and pondreth these present
goodes to be of a great price, and
worthy to be tarid for. This mind
I say, as wel in a cōmuner, as in a
kynge, as well in a yoman as in a
lord, as wel in an hermite, monke,
or frier, as in a marchant plowmā
or vacabunde, as wel in beggers,
as in ryche men, is the thinge that
causeth sorow in dying. And gladly
no manne dyeth, that loueth the
welthe of this lyfe. Wherfore the
lerning to die wel requireth necessary
a lesson, howe moche the goodes
of this worlde be worthy to be
regarded. And let the truthe haue
in your stomacke his place, so that
if it be tru, that the thinges of this
life be worthy to be loued and to be

cared for: than loue you them and
care for them. If the truth be other
wise, change your mynd, & nother
loue these saide thynges, nor care
for them. Of the truth in this matter
no man can dout, that beleueth
Christe, whom if you thynke to be
god, you muste also thinke it all
trouth that he saith. It can not be
otherwise then Christe testifieth,
whose preching euer exhorteth vs
to wylful pouertie, the which is nother
to loue ye goodis of this world
though we haue thē, nor to care for
them, though we haue them not:
only by Christis teching we shulde
care for the kingdom of heuen, the
whiche standeth in the clennes of
conscience, where euer is a place
& a seete for the hie maiestie of the
holy trinitie. All other thinges necessary
for this lyfe be not to be cared

for, nor yet to be valured more
then their dignities requirith: that
is to say, no more thā is cōuenient
for instrumētes & toles to ye pilgremage
& passage of this strāge coū
               trey.
For in this world we haue no
home, our father dwelleth not in
his region, we be in this lyfe out of
our ꝓpre countrey, we shulde hast
home ward to the ioyful presēce of
our owne father, yt abydeth vs in
heuen, the whiche hath a greatter
charge ouer vs his chyldern here,
than he hathe ouer the beastes or
byrdes, the whiche by his only prouision
without their care, lacketh
nothinge for their necessitie, Moche
more (sayth our master Christ)
if we tourned all our care to godwarde,
we shulde not be destitute
of such thinges as necessarily this
present lyfe nedeth. And where

Christe so streytly commaundeth
almes dedes, sayinge, that who so
euer helpeth not a pore man in his
nede, he wil not helpe him nor yet
knowe him at the fearefull day of
dome, in so moche that it pleaseth
Christ to say, that euery pore man
representeth the person of goddes
son, so that he that regardeth not a
pore man, despiseth the son of god.
In this doctryne what thynke
you? Whether dothe Christe commaunde
almes deades for the
poore mans sake, that shulde take
almes, or for the ryche mans sake,
that shoulde gyue almes? In takynge
almes I fynde no vertue,
and nedes it is a thynge parteynynge
to vertue, that Christ wolde
haue done. Therfore surely it is
for the ryche mans sake. For it is
Christes lesson, that techeth vs to

haue no inwarde loue to these casual
goodes, the whiche we must put
from vs, where we see theym that
wante suche thynges. And a profe
of a perfecte stomake is taken in
him, that vtterly leauyth and forsakethe
all this worlde to folowe
Christe: the whiche beddeth the
ryche man, that wyll be perfecte,
to go & sell al that he hath, & deale
all to poore men. For as harde a
thynge it is to plucke through the
smale nedels eie a greatte caboull
rope, as to brynge a ryche man in
at heuens wycket: not that it is
impossible for a riche man to be saued,
but by cause it is harde for a
man in a whelthy state to kepe his
minde in a due order to godward,
without beyng drowned or infected
by the contagious lustes and
corrupted plesures, the which foloweth

the fortunate lyfe of this
worlde. And nothynge is more
in a rich man to be feared, than lest
he sette his mynde to loue his ryches,
the whiche loue can neuer
stande with the pleasure of god.
            Remembre the sayenge of thappostelle
saynct Paule: The loue of
ryches is the rote of all syn. Therfore
let not this loue grow in your
harte, from whense shuld springe
the frute of damnation. Here of my
frende walker, I trust you se, that
without question it is Christes wil
to haue vs lyttel regarde this life,
and moche lesse to regarde all the
commodities apperteining to this
lyfe. It is god that sayth, The losinge
of lyfe in this worlde, is the
fynding of life in a nother worlde:
and that wepynge, sorowe, peyne,
tribulation, pouertye, shame, persecution,

and fynally death in this
lyfe, is laughinge, ioy, pleasure,
ease, ryches, honour, quietnes,
and fynallye lyfe, in the kyngedome
of god.
            Contrarye the same maister testifiethe,
that myrthe, welthe, reste,
glorye, abundance, strengthe, libertye,
rule, & fynally life in this
worlde, is lamentyng, grefe, trouble,
slaunder, myserye, wekenes,
thraldome, bondage, and fynally
deathe in goddes reygne. In this
tenor and key sowneth al our holy
scripture. Wherfore my thynke
it is inough to proue to a Christened
man, that the welthy state of
this worlde is vayne and ieoperdous,
by cause Christe so teacheth
and preacheth, and surely a greater
profe by reason for this matter
with you I wyll not vse atte this

tyme. Let Christe be beleued, that
beddeth you gether a tresure in heuen,
where your ryches shall besure
from mothes, wormes, and
rustynge, from theues, fyer, and
water. If your treasure be ones
couched in heuen, streyghte your
harte shall also be there: and soo
shall you take no pleasure of taryinge
in this lyfe, but rather it shal
be werines and tediousnes to you
to be here absente from your hartes
desyre, the whiche alwaye stycketh
and cleueth to your treasure
in heuen, If hit soo be that after
Christes consaille you haue there
put al your goodes and substance.
If nother we feare death nor loue
this lyfe, I thynke the chefe impedimentes
& lettis of our purpose to
dye wel, be taken away, & nowe we
may a litel deuise, what thing may

helpe vs in our iourney after these
stones and blockes be gone.
            ¶In my mynde nothynge shalle
further vs more to a gladde deth,What dreth glad 
                     〈◊〉
                  
               
than shall an ordinate lyfe, that is
to liue in a iust & a due maner after
one rule & one forme, euer awake
in a quicke remēbrāce of death, as
though euery houre were our last
space of induraunce in this world.
When you rise in the morning, determine
so to passe ye day folowing
as though at nyght a graue shuld
be your bed. Let euery daye be reckened
with you as your last. This
minde shal make you bestowe well
your lyfe, the whiche is to you vncerteyne,
howe longe it shall contynue:
ye rather in doubte you be,
how sone or how shortly life shalbe
taken from you. What so euer you
take in hande bethinke you, that

before you ende it, death may oppresse
you workynge. This is the
thynge that Christ wolde haue vs
do, when he so often warneth and
admonisheth vs to take hede and
to loke aboute vs, bycause nother
the daye nor the houre of our callynge
is certayne to vs. Therfore
it is our parte, of a tyme so moche
vncertaine to make a time sure, certayne,
and present, that we neuer
be taken vnwares: by the whiche
meanes we shal gladly suffre deth
seyng it is a thyng so longe before
prepared. For why shulde it be a
strange thynge to reken euery day
to be the laste? I see not but that
thynge, that happeneth and chanseth
to some of vs, myght come to
any of vs, and lyke wise all might
haue that that a fewe hath. There
is no cause to deny, but as wel this

day you or I myght dye, as we see
this day some other deed: & though
we be not deed this daye, yet it is
trowthe that this day we dye, and
dailye sithen our fyrste byrthe we
haue died, in as moche that dayly
some parte of our life, hath ben diminished,
& euer as we haue growen,
so euer life hath decresed. We
were babys, we were chyldern, we
were boyes, we were yonge men,
all these ages be loste, and tyll yesterdaye
all tyme past is gone and
lost. This same selfe day that we
nowe lyue, is deuyded and parted
with death. Styll without ceassing
we approche to death by thexpence
& wast of lyfe. Thus dyinge
we alway be, though death be not
alway vpon vs. Conceyue than
this ordinate lyfe in your mynde,
& bestowe your tyme whilest you

haue the tyme. Aboue all thynges

                  ••
               y idelnes, the whiche is a thynge
bothe to the body and to the soule.
lyke a kankerynge rustines, and
as an earynge consumption, hit
wasteth to naughte bothe vertue
and strength. A man the whiche
is in the lyfe that you be, may sone
be corrupted with this contagion
of idelnes, if he be not well ware,
& diligently enforce him selfe to the
contrary. For I se you haue a maister
so affectionate & giuen to you,
yt he wyll nother suffer you lacke
any thynge mete for your helthe or
quietnes, but also he had rather
forbeare his owne commodities,
than for his seruyce you shulde be
disquieted: So tender he is in all
poyntes ouer you, that if you ponder
well his state and your owne
condition, you shall finde your life

better defended from all stormes
agaynst the mindes rest, than your
maisters condition is. He is in suche
a syghte of the worlde, that necessarily
his studye and care muste
moue hym to satysfye the greatte
expectation, that his hole contrey
hath of his towardnes. And fortune
on the tother syde, is so contrary
to hym, that nedes he muste
by wisdom procure, with no smale
thoughte, howe he may in penury
maynteyne the outwarde face of
his reputatyon: so that for your
quietnes his mynde often laboureth,
where you may do what you
wyll without feare of the worldes
displeasure, without feare of lackynge
or not hauynge inough for
your necessarys, and moche more
than necessitie requireth. Labour
haue you none, but that maye be

rather takē for a pastime, thought
to plese your maister you nede not
take, in as moch you may be assured,
that he can not nor wil not for
the time of his lyfe chaunge his affectiō
toward you. Therfore I say
it may be fered in one of your state,
lest idelnes shuld brede a foule slouens
neste, the which were inough
to distroye all lustines of vertue, &
to make you longe deed and buried
in this worlde, before lyfe forsaketh
you. For my good Iohn̄, I
wyll haue you knowe and remembre,
that idelnes is called the graue
of lyuynge men: it is the thynge,
wherin life dyeth, and therby your
soule is twyse buryed in you,
ons in your bodye, nexte in your
slothe. The whiche vyce in seruynge
men most reyneth, and the
same is roote of manye vnthrysty

thoughtes, whervpon folowethe
a worse idelnes than the tother is.
For it is an yuell ydelnes to do no
thynge, but a worse ydelnes hit is
to do not well. Suche an ydel felowe
sainct Chrysostomus calleth
a dissolatynge, or a voyde baityng
place, wherinto the dyuel entrith,
as in to his owne howse by good
right. For where vertu is not exercised,
there the enmy of grace claymith
his rule, it is not now mi purpose
to shewe what you shuld do, yt
you might not only fly idelnes, but
also be well occupyed. This were
a mattier inoughe for a nother
worke. I haue my intente at this
tyme, if you se that death is not to
be feared, and that by contynuall
remembraunce of death, you shall
prepayre your selfe to dye gladlye
with a good wyll: the whiche you

can not do, onles you be in hope of
the euerlasting life, & this hope requireth
some trust in the clenes of
a good conscience, the which euer
foloweth a gracious intēt of liuīg
wel. So yt if you liue wel, you shal
dye wel. And of the way to liue wel
you cā not misse, if you arme your
minde to be strong agaynst al suddennes
of deth. Pray euer continually
without cessing you must: but
what is this continuall prayer I
wolde you lerned. For of prayer
it is but one fynal portion, the sayinge
of psalmes or axing with wordes
of god his grace, the very praier
is to be euer wel mynded, to be
euer in charitie, to haue euer the
honour of good in rememberance,
to suffre no rancore, none yre, no
wrath, no malice, no syn to abyde
in your delyte, but to be in a continual

good thought, the which you
maye kepe whether you slepe or
wake, whether you eate or drynke,
whether you feaste or fast, whether
you rest or labour, & neuer parauē
               ture
you can pray better, than whā
you must giue your selfe to serue
your maister, to whom ye course of
your life is due & boundē specially
when god hath giuen you suche a
maister, whom your seruice cā not
plese without you be studyous to
please god. For wel you see, yt with
out vertue your seruyce were to
your maister an vnsauery thynge:
but (as I haue sayd) it is not now
my purpose to apoint you the way
of lyuynge wel: if you haue harde
inoughe to dye wel, I haue for my
parte nowe sayde inough, & shortlye
by the same you shall of your
selfe without farther helpe fynde

the waye to lyue well. Nowe that
by this I thynke my promysse
fulfilled, I will at this poynte bed
you farewel, and I pray god giue
you a stronge corage to passe valy
antly through death, to come from
thence to euerlastynge lyfe, by the
helpe and grace of our mayster
and sauyour Christ, to
whome lette vs for
euer more render
al glory,
prayse, and honour. Amen.
