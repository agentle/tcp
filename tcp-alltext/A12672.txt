            To the right worshipful
and his good Vncle, Maiſter
HVGH BAMFILD Eſquier, GEORGE
TVRBERVILE vviſheth Neſtors
yeares, vvith all good fortune.
            
               WORSHIPFVL, as deſire
not altogither to be
idle and vvaſte the golden
Time (the rareſt of
all Ievvels) procurde me
to vndertake the tranſlation
of this Poet: ſo
Nature, vvith your ſundrie
curteſies beſtovved
on me vvithout hope of
recompence at any time, enforced me (for vvant of
better vvay to ſhevve my good meaning) to dedicate
to you this rude and ſlender Booke, tranſlated
into our mother tongue. Hoping that as I haue not
vvronged the Poet in any poynt in my tranſlation,
or impairde his credite vvith the Latins, in forcing
him to ſpeake vvith an Engliſh mouth contrary to
his nature and kinde: ſo neyther that I haue miniſtred
you occaſion to myſlike vvith me for dedication
of the ſame to you: a man vvhoſe benefites I
may and vvill endeuour to requite, but ſhall neuer

be able to rid my ſcore of his good turnes, or cancell
the obligation of hys many and infinite curteſies.
If a man be bound by all meanes that he may
to gratifie hys vvell deſeruing friendes: then may
not I quiet my ſelfe and be at ſilence till I haue deuiſed
the requital of ſome part of your friendſhips,
by ſome ſlender gift, ſuch as my Fortune and preſent
chaunce vvill permit me to exhibite vnto you.
And none can I fynde, eyther more agreeing vnto
my ſtate, or fitter for your vvorſhip, than this nevv
tranſlated Poet. Whoſe title though at the firſt perhaps
ſhall ſeeme ouerrude and barbarous (for EGLOGS
are altogither of the Countrey affaires) yet
doubt I not but that both the matter ſhal be found
pleaſant, and the ſtyle agreable to the Latin phraſe.
I do not myſtruſt but MANTVANS Shephierds
vvill vſe the matter vvith ſuch dyſcretion, and ſo ſet
their ruſticke Pipes in tune, as you vvill rather cō
               mend
their melodie, than myſlike their audacitie:
that being Countrymen dare vndertake to tel their
tales before you, and reaſon of ſo many and ſeueral
matters as in theſe Eglogs they do. They vvere not
in that age ſuch ſiellie ſottes as our Shephierdes are
novve a dayes, onely hauing Reaſon by Experience
to prate of their Paſtures, and folde and vnfolde
their flockes: But theſe fellovves, vvhome the Poet
and I haue here brought in, vvere vvell able both to
moue the doubtful cauſe, and (if neede vvere) to diſcide
the proponed caſe. They not only knevve the
Calfe from the Lambe, the Woulfe from the Maſtife,

but had reaſon to knovv the dyfference tvvixt
Tovvne and Countrey, the oddes betvvixt Vice and
Vertue, and other thinges needefull and appertayning
to the life of man. Wherfore (Vncle) as I ſhal
craue you to accepte this my ſlender gift, vndertaking
the Patronage and Defence of the
ſame: So ſhall I requeſt the Gods
to allovve you the aged
Neſtors yeares,
vvith no myſſeaduenture in al
your life.
            
               Your Nephewe and daylie Orator
George Turbervile.
            
         
         
            
            To the Reader.
            
               HAVING TRANSLAted
this Poet (gētle Reader)
although baſely and
with barren pen, thought
it not good nor friendly to
wythhold it frō thée: knowing
of olde thy wonted curteſie in pervſing
Bookes, and diſcretion in iudging
them without affection. I ſhal think my
paynes paſſing well imployed if yu ſhew
thy accuſtomed fauoure to this Booke,
which I haue nowe forced to a new and
forraine Language from that it was.
            Though I haue altered the tong, I truſt
I haue not chaunged the Authors meaning
or ſenſe in any thing: but played
the part of a true interpretor, obſeruing
that which we terme Decorum in eche
reſpect, as far as the Peete and our mother
tong wold giue me leaue. For as y•
conference betwixt Shephierds is familiar
ſtuffe & homely: ſo haue I ſhapt my
ſtile and tempred it with ſuche common
and ordinarie phraſe of ſpeach as Countreymen
do vſe in their aſſaires: alway

minding the ſaying of Horace, whoſe
ſentence I haue thus engliſhed.
            
               To ſet a Manlie heade vpon a Horſes necke,
               And all the lims vvith diuers plumes of diuers
hue to decke,
               Or paint a vvomans face aloft to open ſhovve,
               And make the Picture ende in fiſh, vvith ſcaly
ſkinne belovve
               I thinke (my friendes) vvould cauſe you laugh
and ſmile to ſee
               Hovv yl theſe yl compacted things and members
vvould agree.
            
            For in déede, he that ſhall trāſlate a ſhephierds
tale, and vſe the talke and ſtile of
an Heroicall perſonage, expreſſing the
ſiellie mans meaning with loftie thundering
words: in my ſimple iudgement
ioynes (as Horace ſayth) a Horſes necke
and a mans hed togither. For as the one
were monſtrous to ſée, ſo were the other
too fonde and fooliſh to reade. Wherfore
I haue (I ſay) vſed the common country
Phraſe, according to the perſon of the
ſpeakers in euery Egloge, as though in
déede the man him ſelfe ſhoulde tell his
tale. And the ſoner to let thée vnderſtand
the matter contained in euery treatiſe,

I haue (I hope to thy good lyking) foreſet
the Argument. If there be any thing
herein that thou ſhalt happē to myſlike,
neyther blame the learned Poet, nor cō
               troll
the clowniſh Shephierd (good Reader)
but me that preſumde raſhely to offer
ſo vnworthie matter to thy ſuruay.
But if thou fanſy or like wel with ought
contained herein, commend Mantuan,
extoll the Shephierd: ſufficeth me to auoyd
ſcotte frée from ſlaunderous ſnare.
If I gaine thy good wil, I haue the guerdon
of my trauile. Thus preſuming
vpon thy pacience in peruſing this
Booke, thy vncorrupte Iudgemente
in condemning &
allowing the ſame,
I ende my
Preface, crauing thée to len
                  •

            ¶The firſt Egloge of
Mantuan, intituled
FAVSTVS.
            
               The Argument:
               AS Shepheards cuſtome is
               when they do meete yfeare,
               To talke of this or that,
               and tell the newes they heare:
               So Fortunatus craues
               of Fauſtus to begin
               Of auncient loues to treate,
               whilſt flocks a feeding byn.
               When friendly Fauſtus ſawe
               his earneſt friends requeſt:
               To tale of honeſt loue
               the Shepheard him addreſt.
            
            
               The ſpeakers names.
               Fortunatus.
               Fauſtus.
            
            
               Fortunatꝰ
               FRend Fauſtus, pray thée, ſince our flock
               in ſhade and pleaſaunt vale
               Doth chewe the cudde: of auncient loue
               let vs begin to tale.
               
                  
Leaſt if by hap vnhappy ſléepe
               our ſenſes ſhould begyle,
               Some ſauage beaſt in ſprouted corn
                     •
                  
               
               our cattell catch the while:
               For many ſuch about the fields
               do lurking lye in wayte.
               Wherfore to watch is better far
               than ſléepe in my conceyte

               This place, this ſelf ſame ſhady buſhe
               that ſhrowds vs from the heate,
               Knows how I haue bē cloyd with cares
               and Cupids coales ytreat
               Theſe .iiij. yeares ſpace, or .ij. at leaſt
               if I remember well.
               But ſynce we are at leaſure both,
               and pleaſaunt is to tell:
               I will begin the whole diſcourſe
               and ſhewe thée how it fell.
               Here I, whilſt in my tender youth
               of cattell ſhould had care,
               Would ſpread my garmēt on the ſoyle,
               and bolte vpright would ſtare
               Into the open Skyes alofte:
               with d
                     •
                  lefull drops of bryne
               And heauy playnt recounting of
               this curſſed fate of myne.
               
                  
No pleaſure I in quiet tooke,
               no labour did delight
               My penſtue breſt, my Senſe was dull,
               quight buried was my Sprite:
               As is the ſtomacke of the ſicke
               whom no good taſte allures
               Of lothſome meate, nor patients mynd
               to appetite procures.
               Delight of Muſicke was hereſie,
               for Pipe I did not paſſe
               Compacted of vnegall quilles,
               my bowe but lothſome was.
               The ſlyng & hound were hateful both,
               no pleaſure I did put.
               In foulyng then, twas yrkeſom eke
               with knyfe to cracke the Nut.
               To make the bulruſhe baſquet, or
               to guyle the fiſhe with gyn,
               Or ſearche y• brakes for bréeding byrds
               I forced not a pyn.
               
                  Paleſter playes, and caſting lots
               with finger I ne wayd:
               Nor former games that pleaſant were
               ere I this grief aſſayd.
               Wilde grapes to gather was a gall,
               and Strawberries to pull.
               
                  
I mournd as Tereus wife is wo

                  te,
               that hauyng beake as full
               Of foode as it can hold, when ſhe
               retourns from hir repaſt
               And ſées hir yonglings borne away,
               ſhe waxeth all agaſt:
               And from the byll downe fals the bayte,
               hir heart begyns to quayle,
               And to the neighbour buſhe ſhe flies
               hir cruell haps to wayle
               For broud ſo lately borne away.
               Or as the gallant cowe
               That hauyng loſte hir louing calfe
               in field begins to lowe.
               And hauing filld the place with noyſe
               and crying out a good:
               Repaires to ſhade and eates no graſſe
               nor dips hir flaps in floud.
               But why do I with long diſcourſe
               thy lyſtnyng eares offend?
               This proceſſe makes me both my tyme
               and words in waſte to ſpend.
               This is the ſumme of all my tale,
               it grieu'd my weary ſprite
               That miſer I with theſe myne eyes
               did ſée the lothſome light.
               
                  
And if thou longyng for to learne
               the whole effect, ſhouldſt ſay:
               Who (Fauſtus) to theſe dredfull rockes
               did thée compell I pray?
               Frind (Fortunatus) I will ſhewe
               the very trouth to thée.
               My little girle that Galla hight
               had ſo entrapped mée
               With feature of hir friendly face
               and lookes of louyng eye,
               As in hir crafty cobweb doth
               
                  Arachne catche the flye.
               For why hir ruddy chéekes did ſtriue
               with Corall for their hue:
               A pretty round and fully face,
               a ſéemely fight to viewe.
               And of hir eyes though one there were
               that ſtode in little ſtéede;
               Yet when I did recompte hir yeares
               and paſſyng ſhape in déede:
               I did miſlyke Dianas face,
               I ſayd hir feature was
               Not worth a ruſhe, my Galla did
               hir blaſing beautie paſſe.

               and ſléeueleſſe armes, in caſe

               With pipe was Tonius eke at hand,

               and gan theron to blowe.
               His alie chéekes with blaſting breath
               full wide he made to ſtroute,
               
                  
When he began to puffe the pipe,
               he ſtared all aboute,
               And liſted vp his bittle browes,
               and from his lungs full off,
               He drew his winde to fill the bagge,
               that being ſtuffed toſt,
               And brooſed with his elbow downe,
               did yelde his ſounde aloft.
               With finger friſking here and there,
               as he was piping aye:
               He call'd the youth from table, and
               inuited them to play,
               And hoppe about the open ſtréetes,
               and daunce away the day.
               There are ſince that thrée winters paſt,

               Euen as thou ſayſt, perhaps he doth,
               when out of meane and tyme
               He boyles by force of Sommer blaſe,
               and boue the banke doth clyme.
               But now the yeare requires the ſame,
               for from the froſty hills
               The Winter ſnow deſcendeth downe:
               The Mount with water fills
               The ſlacked flouds, and doth diſcharge
               him ſelfe: the floud as faſt
               
                  
Conuayes his burden and the waues
               to gultching Seas doth caſt.
               They play the part that men are wont:
               for when the heauy packe,
               Doth pinche our linunes, we caſt it on
               our néedy neighbours backe.

               O Fortunatus (wonder tis
               and mouſtrous thing to ſayne)
               Though Padus doe decreaſe, our lake
               with greater ſourge doth ſwell:
               The Citie ſwinunes aloſt the ſtreame,
               a ſtraungie tale to tell.
               The vaultes and ſellars ditches are,

               Vnto the barrells, drawers haue

               and fetche the wyne away
               By bottels full, that earſt full drie
               in ſecrete ſellar lay.
               On Towniſh men (though happy they
               appeare to open ſight)
               Yet many times vnhappy haps,
               and cruell chaunces light.
            
            
               
               Fortunatus.
               From euery pleaſure doth aryſe
               diſpleaſure in the ende:
               And aye from euery bleſſed happe

               Thus much of Padus hath ben tolde,
               now let's recite our Loue:
               Since friendly Venus thervnto
               in eche reſpect doth moue.
               The weather is full warme we ſee,
               the ſoyle is gréene to viewe:
               The foules about the field do ſyng,
               now euery thing doth mewe,
               And ſhiftes his ruſtie winter robe.
            
            
               Fortunatꝰ.
               Thou haſte in ſhepheards verſe
               Declarde thy loue, but I will gyn
               anothers to reherſe,
               (A ſhepherd whō thou knowſt full wel)
               to make it playne in ſight
               What force there reſts in Venus flame,
               and ſhewe hir ſtately might.
               
                  Amyntas poore (God wotte) and borne
               vnluckie vnder ſigne:
               Six calues of egall age poſſeſt,
               and had as many kine.
               Whome as he draue to paſture with
               a Bull that father was
               
                  
To all the hierd: It was his chaunce.
               by Coytus to paſſe.
               A place where Myncius with his cleare
               and ſiluer chanell flowes
               And ſwiftly all the graſſy ſoyle
               and meadowes ouergoes.
               A Caſtell new with battled walls
               there faceth on the floode:
               High rayſed vp that Coyte hight,
               and on the mariſhe ſtoode.
               Here reſting him by Riuers ſide
               where grew a goodly vine,
               That wt his boughs did ſhade ye bāks
               and waters paſſing fine,
               He ſtayde to earth the gliding Fiſh
               with baited hooke and line.
               I was Harueſt time, y• ſcorching beams
               of ſcalding Phoebus rayes
               Had ſingde the ſoyle, the Nightingale
               had layde aſide hir layes.
               The ground was withred in ſuch wyſe
               as neither flocke coulde féede
               Theron by day, nor deawe was left
               for Graſſehoppers at néede,
               By night to moiſt their crikyng chaps.
               Here whylſt he ſpent the tyde
               
                  
About the Riuer, and this fonde
               and vayne deuiſe applyde.
               The Bull firſt vexed with the Waſpe,
               and next with curres they ſay,
               And laſt by filching Souldiers meane
               was quite conuayde away,
               Not to be found in field. Which when
               the Boy had vnderſtoode,
               He gat hym to a Mountayne by
               and cried out a good
               For Bull vnhaply loſt of late,
               and all the countrey ſought
               With gréedy gazing eye. But when
               he ſawe it booted nought
               And that his payne could not preuaile:
               his bended Bowe he tooke,
               And painted Quiuer full of ſhafts
               and for his beaſt gan looke
               Through woods wher was no haunted path,
               through euery flock & fold,
               Through paſtures eke to ſée where he
               his Bullocke might behold.
               About Benacus bankes he went,
               and Mountes with Oliue trée
               Beſet, and places where both Figge
               and Vine was gréene to ſee.
               
                  
At length a haughtie hill he hent,
               where did a Chappell ſtande
               Of Sulphur, and from thence he caſt
               his eies about the lande,
               And ouer viewde Benacus bounds,
               and all the countrey rounde,
               To ſée where in that coaſt there were
               his Bullock to be founde.
               It was Sainct Peters day by courſe
               and cuſtome of the yere,
               The youth of euery village by,
               at after noone was there:
               And vnderneath a gréenyſh Elme
               that ſhadowed all the ſoyle,
               At ſounde of pleaſant countrey pipe
               they dauncde, and kept a royle,

               Should ceaſſe from toyle) impaciēt they
               of reſt and hunger, fall

               With leaden legs and heauy héeles
               about the Churchyarde trot.
               And all the day do crie and laugh,

               The counſell that comes after all
               thyngs are diſpatcht at laſt,
               Is like a ſhowre of rayne that falls
               when ſowing time is paſt.
               Among the reſt of all the route
               a paſſing proper Laſſe,
               A white haird trull of twenty yeares
               or néere aboute there was:
               In ſtature paſſyng all the reſt,
               a gallant Girle for hewe:
               To be cōpard with Towniſh Nimphs
               
               ſo faire ſhe was to viewe.
               Hir forhead cloth with gold was purlde
               a little here and theare:
               With copper claſpe about hir necke
               a kerchiefe did ſhe weare.
               
                  
That reached to hir breaſt and paps:
               the Wench about hir waſt,
               A gallant gaudy ribande had
               that girte hir body faſt.
               In Peticote of countrey ſtuffe
               Mockadoe like, ſhe goes:
               I was plaited braue, y• length was ſuch

               As ſoone as hir the youth had ſpide,

               By ſight he ſucked in the flame,
               and meane of wanton eye:
               He ſwallowde vp the blinding fyre,
               and in his belly plaſt
               The coles that neither waues could quēch
               nor rainie imber waſt,
               No not inchātmēts, witches words,
               it cloong ſo cloſe and faſt.
               Forgetful he of former flocke,
               and damage done with waues,
               Was all imaged with this flaſh,
               at night he nought but raues.
               The ſeaſon that for quiet ſléepe
               by nature poynted was,
               In bitter plaintes and cruell cries,
               this burning Boy did paſſe.
               
                  
I ſundry times for pities ſake
               his growing flame to ſtay,
               And ſtop the frantike furie, would
               to hym full often ſay:
               O lamentable lad, what God
               hath forcde thée thus to fare?
               But ſure it was no worke of Gods
               that bred this bitter care.
               Nay rather twas the cruelſt impe,
               and ſpitefulſt fiende of hell,
               Of thoſe with Lucifer that from
               the ſkies to dungeon fell,
               That nine dayes ſpace were tumbling downe:
               I pray thée make me ſhow
               And call to mynde where euer yet
               thou any man dydſt know
               By fooliſh loue aduauncde to wealth,
               or any office borne:
               Or raiſde by meanes therof his houſe,
               or ſtufft his barnes with corne?
               Dydſt euer any knowe that hath
               therby enlargde his bounds:
               Increaſte his flocke, or for his hierd,
               ygotten fruitful grounds?

                  Amyntas had no ſooner heard
               the name of Lawes rehearſt,
               But aunſwered (for in Citie he
               a Boy was foſtred earſt)
               Thou goeſt about to farre ſurmount
               by giuing this aduiſe
               The Catos both, and to be thought
               both circumſpect and wiſe.
               This errour and this madneſſe beares
               eche where a cruell ſwaye:
               Man flattreth with him ſelf, and would
               be counted crafty, aye
               A creature able to forſee:
               yet many a ſnare and gin
               And ditche that he him ſelfe hath delu'de
               the Miſer falleth in.
               He firſt was frée, but to his necke
               him ſelfe did frame the yoke:
               In ſeruile chaine him ſelfe he bounde,
               and bands of fréedome broke.
               So weightie are thoſe Lawes (my ſelfe
               haue ſéene the Bookes ere this)
               As neither predeceſſours, nor
               our ſelues can kepe ywis:
               Nor aftercommers ſhall obſerue
               the meanyng of the ſame.
               
                  
Behold the fooliſh wit of man,
               that thinkes ſuch feate to frame,
               As to the heauens to aſpire:
               and hopes at length to get

               Perhaps when life is loſt, he ſhall
               into a foule conuarte:
               And then his feathred ſoule with wyngs
               to welkin ſhall departe.
               And then (quod I) what brawle is this?
               ſince God dyd ſo deuiſe

               when I his follie blamde:

               in common doth not well,
               But enuious may accompted be.
               But yet this ſpitefull hate
               The cloake of honeſt cuſtome doth
               in ſome reſpect abate.
               For whilſt ech man vnto him ſelf

               A hatefull thing is Loue (God wotte)
               and pleaſure ſpitefull eke.

               But Harculus reported hath

               That in the coaſt was much a doe

               For Cattle is the onely wealth

               doth tender age annoy.
               Euen I that Cattell haue good ſtore
               and milke and chéeſe ynow,
               Lyue hardly, and do weare away
               the world with ſweate of brow
               
                  
And much adoe God wote. For why
               our fields did fayle of late,
               Such néede doth raygne in euery plae
               we are at beggars ſtate.
               So many heauy happes we haue,
               ſuch miſchiefs dayly light,
               Such crabbed lucke as all the world
               is now in piteous plight.
               Giue eare to things not heard alone
               or ſpred by bruted fame,
               Nor many yeares agoe betyde,
               my ſelf haue ſéene the ſame:
               And at this day do dayly viewe,
               the proufe doth now appears.
               As cuſtome is, in Month of May
               
               I earſt my Shéepe did ſheare,
               And thréeſcore pounds of paſſing wooll
               betyme to ſale did ſette:
               But now a dayes I thought alike
               like gaynes therby to gette,
               And ſcarce could kepe my flock aliue
               and Winter fodder bie,
               In froſt and ſnow the cruell wante
               of paſture to ſupplie.
               Oh Lord (Amyntas) how my folke
               ſhall lyue I know not I.
               
                  
Who ſo doth loue, vnto his Laſſe
               muſt many preſents ſende:
               But thou whom ſcarce a houſe to dwel
               would cruell Fortune lende:
               Where day & night is want of wealth
               and lacke of golden ſée:
               How canſt thou ſhift to ſend thy Trull
               ought that may gratefull bée?
               Eare this ſuffiſde vnto a Mayde
               ten appels gay to bring,
               A Garland freſhe of fragrant floures,
               a Neaſt of byrdes to ſyng.
               I knew when in as great a price
               the countrie maydes did holde
               A Garland as a better gyfte:
               but now from graſſe to golde
               They are aſcended, Loue is now
               become a ſtately thing:
               The auncient cuſtome is decayde
               new lawes do dayly ſpring
               As touching trade of gréedy Loue,
               they gape for greater gayne.
               With angry brow and lowring looke
               repleate with foule diſdayne
               To me perſwading thus beſpake
               
                  Amyntas. Friend (quod hée)
               
                  
Friend Fortunatus, if thou long
               to purchaſe eaſe to mée
               And wiſſhed comfort to reduce,
               allow me that I Loue:
               That onely thing my crankred griefe
               and gripings may remoue.
               The reſt thou babbleſt torments are,
               this furie wil not ſtinte
               Nor rooted be from out my heart.
               Within my breaſt the printe
               And Image of the Virgin ſits.
               With me ſhée ſoiournes aye:
               With me ſhée goes & makes retourne,
               when I retourne by daye.
               At night with me ſhée lodgeth eke
               and ſléepes in ſelf ſame bed.
               She hath ſo ſeazde vpon my bones,
               my marrow, heart, and hed,
               As neuer may ſhe well departe
               till lyfe theſe lymmes hath fled.
               And as, what tyme a tender ſlippe
               cutte from a forraine trée
               Is grafte into another ſtocke
               their natures ioyned bée,
               And ſo by growth become as one:
               euen ſo the Virgins grace
               
                  
And Image of hir comely looke
               and Idol of hir face
               Was planted déepe within my breſt,
               our harts became as one,
               Both one our mynds, the difference
               twixt hir and me was none.
               One ſenſe, one ſoule did ſerue vs both
               our lymmes ſo lincked were.
               Oh happy I, if when my corſe
               ſhall deade be plac'd on Bere,
               And fatall Siſters ſhrid my twiſt
               and finger cloſe myne eye,
               I might twixt thoſe hir lilly armes
               and pappes in boſome lye:
               With heauy hed when ſoule were paſt
               and liuely line ycutte,
               That ſhe theſe dying eyes of mine
               mougth with hir finger ſhutte.
               And might with ſhrill and doleful voyce
               bewéepe my heauy fate:
               And poure hir chriſtall teares adowne
               for loſſe of louing mate.
               Wher to the bleſſed Fields that are
               alloted to the good
               I after life do paſſe: or forcde
               downe to the Stygian flood
               
                  
And fiery ſtreame of Phlegeton
               
               thoſe freatting fitts abyde:
               Mée neyther payne withouten thée
               nor pleaſure ſhall betyde.
               O Dryads, and yea ſacred Nimphs
               
               of floures that haue the care,
               O Sire Syluanus that doeſt rule
               where pleaſant arbours are:
               I pray you garde amyd your mounts,
               and ſhady vales belowe
               The ſwéete and ſmellyng floures that
               within your circuits growe,
               (The beautie of the Country fields
               and queachy Groues we haue)
               Do hedge your boūds frō féeding flocks
               the floury ſoyle to ſaue.
               Reſerue (I pray you) them tyll néede
               to decke the Herſe withall
               Of my ſwéete wench whē ſhe by ſtroke
               of dreadfull death ſhall fall.
               Then, then let all y• ground be ſtrowde,
               let garlands then be plide:
               At tyme of death aud buriall of
               my Loue hir Herſe to hide.
               
                  Pierides the penſiue Nimphes
               
               at hand ſhall then be preſte,
               
                  
With wéeping eyes lamenting of
               the Graue ſo gayly dreſte.
               And ſhall inſculpe theſe wofull words
               vpon the Marble ſtone,
               Of after comers to be read
               when we are paſt and gone.
               Here buryed lyes a Laſte
               that wanted nought at all
               Saue that ſhe cruell was,
               a ſacred Saynt to call.
               Oh Virgin if ſo great a fire
               did burn within thy bones
               By thouſand Scyllas and as many
               
                  Charybds I at ones
               Would ſwym to thée to bréed thy eaſe:
               thou feller than a ſnake
               Doſt flée thy friend. But what néede I
               ſo much adoe to make?
               And blame y• wight? ſhe knows me not.
               No doubt if ſo the mayde
               Had vnderſtanding what I were,
               ſhe would procure myne ayde.
               There can not be a braſen breaſt
               where doth ſuch feature flow:
               But yet we muſte not ouermuch
               beléeue the flattring brow.
            
            
               
               Fauſtus.
               For often vnder ſmotheſt ſkin
               doth lurke a cankred minde:
               And vnder friendly forhead is
               a hatefull heart to finde.
               I will goe talke and let hir witte
               of this my hidden fire.
               But oh, if ſhe ſhould wrie hir lookes,
               and barre me my deſire:
               To tears my Chriſtal eyes would ſoone
               conuert as you ſhould ſée,
               My wofull breaſt to ſobbyng ſighes
               tranſformed ſtraight would bée.
               And though ſhe hate me (cruell) aye
               and flée hir friend apace:
               Yet me this waſting care will ſtill
               purſue in euery place.
               Fare well ye Phiſicke artes, for I
               am not to be recurde:
               Adiew ye eke to fetche from Hell
               the ſoules that are invrde
               With Magicke verſe & Witches call,
               (vngodly thing to léeue)
               Farewell ye all that vaynely hope
               with booteleſſe wordꝭ ye géeue,
               The ſtéelie mindes of Gods to wreſt:
               for now I ſée the Skyes
               
                  
Are cruell foes of mine and will
               not bende for all my cries.
               Impacient furie drawes me on,
               it doth me good alone
               To range the hills, and wāder through
               the woods and caues vnknowne
               The doutful dens of dredful Beaſts.
               Him ſpeaking thus I thought
               And went about with friendly words
               to wreſt, but all for nought.
               The cureleſſe woūd by no means cā
               
               to perfect ſtate be brought
               He myd the ſilent Night amids
               the fields would rangle aye:
               In buſhy Launds with waking eyes
               he walkt at créeke of day.
               The Wilding was his onely foode,
               the Crab he vſde to craſh:
               And with a draught of water he
               his thirſtie iawes did waſh
               And was therwith right well content.
               At length vnhappie Lad
               When he his many wofull cryes
               and ſchritches yelled had,
               When teareleſſe woxe his waſted eyes
               and drie for want of wette,
               
                  
When he with oft reboundyng ſobbes
               his bulke had all to bette:
               Came gentle Death, and quiet brought
               to his vnquiet ſtay.
               The Carcas dead and brethleſſe Corps
               that there vnterred lay
               Withouten honor of the graue
               the Sauage beaſts by night,
               And gréedy tyring filthy Foules
               by day deuoured quight.
            
            
               Fauſtus.
               Oh murreyn vile and fatall ginne,
               that with thy venomde darts
               The bulks of men doeſt pierce, & poyſned
               ſhafts our mortall harts,
               And makſt vs brutiſh ſéeme to ſight,
               no bet than ſauage are.
               What cuppe of Circes, or Calipſo
               
               might with this compare?
               What drench might Stix, or Phlegetō,
               
               or Furies worſſe deuiſe?
               O doltes that Loue accompt a God,
               O blynde and bleared eyes.
               Is God a Nature hurtfull? No.
               Where euer he doth wonne,
               He ruthfull is to man, and doth
               no yll, of dexter doome.
            
            
               
               Fortunatus.
               Oh Wofull wretched Boy that in
               thy tender yeares didſt die:
               What time y• thou wert born what ſtarres
               bare ſway in ſwinging Skie?
               What part of welkin wrought thy wo?
               that didſt deſerue no yll?
               What curſſed corner of the Heauens
               did thée vntimely kill?
               Yet was not all the Heauen thy foe,
               thou couldſt as well as wée
               With Oaten quill and pleaſant pipe
               make ioily game and glée.
               Had not this ouer haſty death
               thy life ſo ſoone oppreſt,
               Thou hadſt deſeru'de Pernaſsus crowne
               and Laurell with the beſt.
               No better Tytirus (belou'de
               of his Alexis) roong
               Of cruell fight, of dreadfull warre,
               and of his tillage ſoong
               Than thou: for why thy timely ripe
               capacitie was knowne
               To vs, it did preſage what fruite
               in time thou wouldſt haue ſowne.
               No vulgar triall of thy ſkill,
               and towarde witte was ſéene:
               
                  
It well declarde if thou hadſt liude
               what thou wouldſt after bene.
               Now moughtſt thou ben accōpted thou
               the glory and the praiſe
               Of all our ſoyle, not ſuch a one
               did liue in theſe our dayes.
               Thée Padus, and with wéeping browes
               our Myncius did lament,
               Yea Nimphs thēſelues: as Hebrus earſt
               for Orpheus was bedrent
               With trickling ſhowrs of falling tears.
               The maiſter ſhepheards all
               Did rue thy death as Daphnis earſt
               was pitieo for his fall.
               Thée all the Champion fields aboute,
               both hill and vale doe crie:
               And all the Paſture grounds did lift
               their clamours to the ſkie.
               O Shepheardes with ſwéete ſmellyng floures
               beſtrow his bitter graue:
               The ſong of Prieſt and fuming Cenſe,
               (Oh, yearely) let him haue.
               Ye Poets eke eternall reſt

               But what? (Amyntas) thou doeſt lodge
               in farre a better coaſt
               
                  
Than wée, in Fields for happy ſoules
               allotted thou doeſt wonne:
               And we below in Earth bewaile

               I knew we ſhould lament to day,

               But now you ſée the night is come,

               In Cloude declares y• ſhowrs at hād,
               wherfore tis time to runne
               To fold our flock. And Fauſtus thus

               The Argument.
               HEre Ianus ſhews the Goate was loſt,
               he telles the curſſed Fate
               And doth bewray the Bedlam Boyes
               vnhappy frantike ſtate.
               
                  
And by the way good Alphus he
               to quite his fellowes payne:
               The kinde of woman doth depaint
               and makes their maners playne.
               Let neuer honeſt Lucrece lowre,
               let no good Griſell grutch:
               For neither Alphus here, nor I
               the modeſt matrone toutch.
               We nippe the cruell cankred crue
               with beautie that allure,
               And hauing thralde the miſer, ſeeke
               no ſalue his ſore to cure:
               But take delight with ſcornefull chere
               and face of foule diſdaine
               Like Vipers vile to ſowe the ſeedes
               of our faſt ſpringing payne.
               Thoſe, thoſe ar thei that Mātuā means
               thoſe Alphus doth declare:

               Alphus.
               MOre leane (Oh Ianus) ſéemes thy Goate
               than ere he was of yore:
               
                  
For luſty he his hornes ere this
               into the Welkin bore.
               But grouelyng now on ground he lies
               with lyther lolling eares,
               He ſmelles to graſſe, to touch the herbs
               at length of lips he feares.
            
            
               Ianus.
               He droupes, and of his drouping doth
               a pleaſant ieſt ariſe:
               Which loke how oft I mind, doth make
               me laugh with ſmyling eyes.
               As yet it is not ſpread abroade,
               but when the brute is blowne,
               And that through euery countrey is
               this pleaſant ſtory knowne:
               Then all y• world wil laugh therat
            
            
               Alphus.
               (O Ianus) thou ere this
               Werte wont to tell a mery ieſt
               in merrieſt wiſe ywis,
               And with a ſwéete delighting voyce:
               Wherfore I pray thée now
               Declare me why the Goat doth droupe,
               and tell how fell it how?
            
            
               Ianus.
               God is my iudge twas neuer faynde
               of me, but done in dede,
               And lately too: But ſhall I tell
               the tale withouten méede?
               
                  
And chatte for nought & waſt'my wind?
               Nay, what wilt giue to mée?
               What ſhall I haue for telling of
               this ieſt beglarde with glée?
            
            
               Alphus.
               O friende, when ſo the Nightingale
               (that Philomela hight)
               Hath built hir neſt, and ſitts a broode
               I will thy trauaile quight.
            
            
               Ianus.
               Who ſo doth make ſuch raſh beheſts
               by dayly proufe we ſée
               Performes not pacted promiſe, but
               his touch is wont to flée.
            
            
               Alphus.
               Nay, who ſo lends ſuch light beliefe
               diſtruſt doth beare in breaſt.
               But for you ſhall be ſure that I
               nill play the guilefull gueſt,
               Take here a pledge of promiſe made
               and bargaine earſt by mée:
               Take here (I ſay) from out my caſe
               two Flights that farre will flée.
            
            
               Ianus.
               I will begyn: O ſacred Nimphs
               
               
                  Parnaſides I pray
               Do moue your iawes, & guide my tong
               that I may well diſplay
               My welbeloued Goates miſhap
               and miſaduenture fell:
               
                  
And graūt that Alphus Nightingale
               may hatche hir yonglings well
               That I may haue that he behight
               for this good tale I tell.
               With pennie I a Lad did hire
               my little flocke to kéepe:Narrati
                        •
                     
                  
               
               I g
                     •
                  ue him charge and ouerſight
               of all my fléezie ſhéepe.
               He kepte both Kids and females eke,
               and Ramme goates too with care:
               And ouerlook'd my flocke that I
               the Stripling could not ſpare.
               Till time at laſt by Fortune he
               a pretty Mayden ſawe,
               (That hither came of purpoſe bent
               at water place to drawe
               Such water as ſuffiſde hir tourne)
               and liked hir ſo well
               As he (good Boy) by feature of
               hir face to fanſie fell.
               And from that tyme and dolefull day
               ſo dumpiſh he became,
               As leſſe regarde he had of ſhéepe,
               (the greater was his ſhame)
               Leſſe forced he ſince that the foldes
               and quight bereſt of witte
               
                  
He ſéemde: So déepe within his breſt
               the Virgins ſhape did ſitte.
               When hée on bed to quiet nap
               his weary limmes did lay:
               Where ſléeping he or waking were
               twas very harde to ſay.
               For when he was wide waking he
               ſuch frantike coyle would kéepe,
               As though (his reaſon quite bereft)
               his wittes were gone to ſléepe.
               So dreamyng was this Boy to ſight,
               ſo lumpiſhe wore the Lad:
               In ſort, that gazers on ſurmiſde
               that he no ſenſes had.
               This Boy bent to refreſh (I ſay)
               his ouertyred mynde
               With ſportyng play, about the hornes
               with twig this Goate did bynde
               Among the thickeſt of the briers
               and buſhy Laundes belowe:
               And ſo to paſſe away the time
               away the Boy dyd goe.
               (And now .iiij. days are paſt and gone)
               thus hée the Goate did tie:
               The ſtrongneſſe of the Wyth & hardneſſe
               of the Hornes to trie.
               
                  
Meanewhile the woods he went about
               and raungde the buſhes rounde,
               To ſée where that within the place
               mought any birds be founde.
               The Mayde reſorted to his thought
               and vndercrept his heart:
               The comely countnance of the Trull
               coulde neuer thence depart,
               Nor beautie of hir bourly breaſt
               his muſyng mynde forgoe,
               The parts not to be namde he rollde
               within his bulke belowe.
               Meanewhile the Sunne had lodgde his light,
               that ſtelly ſotted Mome
               Vnmyndfull of his hamperde beaſt
               afielde, came late to home.
               Amid the night he callde to minde
               that fooliſhe fact of his:
               And thinking to go looſe the Goate
               in all the haſt he riſe.
               And whilſt with fearefull foote he pac
                     •
                  de
               through Dampes as darke as Hell,
               Where lay much chaffe & rotten ſtraw,
               into a Dyke he fell:
               A place of purpoſe made to take
               the ſauage Beaſts by night,
               
                  
A hollow vault and dungeon déepe
               to ſtéepe for any wight
               Once beyng in to clamber vp.
               Thus was the Goate by him
               Faſt boūd with twigs, the Page in pit
               ycaught and dungeon dim.
               No Shepheard kept the beaſts as then,
               twas well néere thrée a clocke:
               I muſde, and went my ſelfe about
               and numbred all the flocke.
               I miſſd the Goate, and maruelde much
               what of the heaſt became,
               I ſought about the flelds: at laſt
               I calde the Boy by name.
               (I tell but truth) I ſtode in feare
               leaſt he by Magike meane
               And Sorcerie had ben raiſde to Skies,
               and Goate diſpatched cleane.
               For Hags and Witches by report
               are caught amids the night
               Much like, and far to Banquets borne
               quite out of cry and ſight.
               This dreading, I to Paſture grounde
               did bring my ſhéepe at laſt
               To féede their fills, and whilſt that I
               did wander all agaſt
               
                  
In irkeſome ſhades and vgglie nookes,
               and entred in the Groue:
               I hearde a farre the braying of
               my Goate, and how he ſtroue
               With punching hornes & puſhyng pate
               againſt the Wyth a good
               I plainly ſawe, and how he bette
               the Buſhe gainſt which he ſtoode.
               This gaſtfull thing affrighted me,
               and monſtrous ſight to viewe
               Vnlooked for. But when at length
               my ſielly Beaſt I knew
               And bolder woxe, I went me in
               among the brakes in haſt:
               With hooke I hewde the brēbles downe
               and buſhy briers at laſt.
               As late in euening home I hide,
               all rounde about the fielde
               A girnyng route of grinning folkes
               by fortune I behelde.
               Approching néerer to the preaſſe
               mée eche began to gréete
               As ſoone's they knew what man I was,
               and friendly did entreate.
               Lo here (quod they) O Ianus is
               a little Lad of thine
               
                  
Tane vp a Woulfe his denne of late
               a déepe and daungerous Myne.
               He wandring late about the Dounes
               did happen (to his payne)
               Vpon this caue, but now both Goate
               and he be founde agayne.
               The Goate that had this cruell hap
               as yet vnluſty is:
               But yet the fooliſh Boy of both
               moſt frantike is ywis.
               The Virgin hearyng that the Lad
               did loue hir paſſyng well:
               Eftſoone as proude as Pecocke woxe
               and with diſdayne did ſwell.
               And makyng wiſe ſhe had not wiſte
               the cares he did indure,
               Pretended honeſt lyfe the more
               the ſtriplyng to allure.
               And to increaſe hir beautie more
               ſhe deckes both face and breaſt
               In fineſt wiſe, and in hir gate
               hir lookes to ground ſhe keaſt.
               Thus Foxelike ſhe with ſimple ſhewe
               and ſéemyng to the eyes,
               In double breaſt and ſubtill heart
               hir craftie meaning plyes.
               
                  
Theſe are the tricks that women vſe,
               this is the ſleightfull ginne:
               Theſe are the cruell weapons that
               the myndes of men do winne.
               Thus hoping he his Gallant girle
               to conquere at the laſt,
               His wages ſcornde, and plide his loue,
               and follows hir in haſt.
               Wherfore now leauing Cart & plough
               and Oxen all alone,
               To Shepheards toyle I will retourne.
               Frayle youth (the more the mone)
               Is vaſſall to this furie fell
               and to this folly thrall:
               It wanders rounde about this coaſt,
               and ouerturneth all.
            
            
               Alphus.
               Lo, ſée what Witte can not deuiſe
               by Fortune comes to thought:
               O wondrous chaunce, O happy happe
               that this to mynde hath brought.
               O famous ieſt for two months ſpace
               well able glée to make:
               Good faith for thée the Nightingale
               now ſitts a broode in brake.
               But that which thou of ſubtill ſleight
               of crafty Laſſe did ſyng,
               
                  
What Vmber earſt of womans guile
               hath wrote, to mynde doth bring.
            
            
               Ianus.
               O tell vs Vmbers merry Verſs,
               if thou haſt ought in ſtore
               Nowe out withall: they ſay he wrote
               a ſtately ſtyle of yore.
            
            
               Alphus.
               Tis as thou tellſt, but for my tale
               what recompence remaines?
               What thāks ſhal I? what guerdon haue
               for vndertaken paines?
            
            
               Ianus.
               Go to, Ill ſtande to bargayne made
               kepe thou thoſe dartes of myne.
            
            
               Alphus.
               O Ianus, whilſt I goe behynde

               too grimme becoms hir grace:
               She powteth then and fiercely frownes.

               Of promiſe made, ſhe friendſhip ſcorns,

               And of a hillocke makes a mount.
               She doth diſſemble ſore,
               She makes in wiſe, and beares in hand
               and learned hath of yore
               Vntruthes and leaſings to deuiſe,

So many are hir miſcheous crafts,

               delude the Senſe of Man.
               We wotte not how to credit ought

               what Fortune ſhall betide
               By Starres that rule at time of birth,
               and they do thus decide.
               The Poets they were wont
               to Mercure to aſſigne,
               And noble Péeres are vnder Ioue
               
               whoſe ſoueraigne Scepters ſhine.
               Them mightie Ioue allowes

                  Mercurius giues thoſe other wit,
               tong, harpe and Verſes feate.
               
                  
That is thy lotted hap,
               why doeſt thou gape for pelfe?
               God doth dyſtribute néedefull things
               as he doth ſée himſelfe
               What is for our auaile:
               wherefore accept thy ſhare
               And liue content, reſigne the reſt
               to vs that wealthie are.

               Thou riches haſt at will,
               I Verſe and Poets trade:
               Why crau'ſt thou then my Verſe, & doſt
               anothers bowndes inuade?
            
            
               Siluanus.
               I reaue thée not thy Muſe,
               nor ought that 'Phoebus gaue:
               But to thy Muſicke for to lende
               an eare, is all I craue.
            
            
               Candidus.
               Then if thou long ſo much
               to heare my pleaſaunt voice,
               (Siluanus) reaſon is, that with
               thy wealth I ſhould reioice.
            
            
               Siluanus.
               He at my wealth doth ioy
               that loues both me and mine:
               The ſpitefull man hates me, and at
               my welfare doth repine.
            
            
               Candidus.
               Yea, then as well thou mayſt
               in abſence take delight
               
                  
Ynough of this my Muſe, and ſo
               thy friendſhip I requite.
               For Verſes are the feaſt
               and iuncket of the eare,
               Chéeſe ſerues to féede the taſting iawes
               in ſteade of better cheare.
               Wherfore if thou deſire
               to feaſt thine eares with ſound:
               Then ſet my chaps a worke with cates,
               for ſo thou ſtandeſt bound
               By loue, and law of God,
               ſo pitie doth perſuade.
               God giues not al his giftes to one,
               but in ſuch ſorte hath made
               His lawes of kinde, that none
               can finde ſuffiſing powre
               Within him ſelfe to ſerue his tourne,
               but at ſome néedefull howre
               He ſtandes in want of helpe
               and of ſome forraine ayde:
               And that is it that doth conioyne,
               and euer yet hath ſtayde
               In league of laſting loue
               all kindes of forraine wightes:
               The French, the Maure, the Italian, &
               the worthy Spaniſh Knightes.
               
                  
Then let vs ioyne yfeare,
               and lincke at laſt in one
               Thoſe ſtarres that at eche others birth
               and day of being ſhone.
               Cauſe Iupiter to be
               my faithfull friend at néede,
               And thou ſhalt haue Mercurius helpe
               if he may ſtande in ſtéede.
               Thou ſhalt not want his Hat,
               his twigge, or Lute to play:

               Good faith, me thinks thou telſt
               a vaine and trifling tale:

               You count it vaine that doth
               your riches wrong a whit.
               But if to heare my merrie Muſe

               Of counſayle I am ſtorde,
               my budget is but bare:
               How ſhould a néedy Poet Wars
               and kingly Campes declare?
               That hath not once ſo much
               good here below the Sunne,
               As knife to cut his Pipe, and cauſe
               the breath by holes to runne?
               Beholde the handle of
               my Whittle how it waggs
               By looſeneſſe of the pinnes: ſée howe
               the edge is all in iaggs
               And toothed like a ſawe:
               but theſe are ſlender things,
               The lacke of meate and drinke is it
               that me ſo vilely wrings.
               
                  
Good counſell ſomewhat mends
               the matter when it cooms:
               But that aduice that fruiteleſſe is
               our ſhaken Senſes nooms.
               It breakes the buſie braine,
               it weakes the wearie witte.
               For Péeres ſmall friendſhips to beſtow
               me thinks is nothing fitte:
               And they do flatte refuſe
               great guerdens to forgoe.

               But thoſe that earſt with hardy hande,
               and courage ſtout did fight,
               That vſed valiaunt armes
               and dealt with deadly blade,
               Not glutted with the gréedie Golde,

               But ſtraight aſſoone as warlike wights

               The Poets could not write,

               and viewes with daylie browe.
               A ſauage man outright
               he loues no learned ſkill,
               Or elſe of much deſired golde
               can neuer haue his fill:
               But drowned lies in mucke
               and filthie Metals mire,
               Quite cruſht with cares as Mydas was
               with gréedie goldes deſire.
               Beſides with Princes are

And he, that what ſo ere he ſayes,
               to pleaſe the eare doth ſpeake.
               Then he that playes on Stage,

               are Vertues deadlie foes:
               Expell him from the Princes Court.
               Much like as when the Crowes
               Haue lothſome Carraine founde

               He was a craftie Childe,

                  Deucalion (with his make
               Good Pyrrha) was a Countrieman.

               He toke them from the earth,

               the Shephierds to the Skie:

               Galbula.
            
            WHat thinkſt thou Galbula?
ſir Pollux paſſing fine
            In piping earſt (I wotte not howe)
            inſpirde with powre deuine
            Forwent his Pipe, his Wéede,
            his charge of Beaſts, his Mates,
            And hooded (as the Lapwings are
            with criſts vpon their pates)
            Foure dayes agoe himſelfe
            to holie houſe did yelde.
            Some think that whilſt his flock he fed
            alone in open fielde,
            He ſawe ſome godlie ſhape
            from Héauen to appeare,
            
               
(The reſt I haue forgot) but what
            thinkſt thou? I long to heare.
            
               Galbula.
               As Sages ſayde, when God
               eche creature gan to make,
               (No trifles I will tell, but ſuch
               of yore as Vmber ſpake)
               Both Clowniſh countrey wights
               and Shephierdes he ordainde:
               The Tylman tough, vnmilde, in ciuill
               nurture neuer trainde,
               Much like the lumpiſh clay
               that Culter doth controll:
               The Shephierd of a ſofter kinde
               a ſielly hurtleſſe ſoule.
               As ſimple as the Shéepe,

               The Shéepe that yelds the milk, & likes
               his kéeper aye withall.
               From flocke to Altare he
               would bring when ſo he came
               Sometime a Shéepe, a fatted Calfe,
               ſometime a ſucking Lambe.
               To Gods their honour due

               His ſeruice ſo preuailde with them,
               he ſo their Godheads bent,
               
                  
As ſince the time the worlde

                  Apollo (as a banniſht man)

               And Shephierds being taught

               And ſawe no Arte preuailde
               their rigor to relent,
               He thought it beſt to runne away:
               and thus to flight ybent
               His onely let was this,
               he lou'd impatiently.
               For doting loue (a common fault)
               doth Youth accompany.
               Loue of it ſelfe is ſtrong,
               the violence doth paſſe.
               He went: At parture (theſe complaints

               Alas may any cunning now

               A double dolour doth

               You Gods (I truſt) will hir preſerue
               in health till my returne.
               That after my exile
               when I ſhall backe retire,
               Our loue may haue a good ſucceſſe
               ere youthfull yeares expire.
               
                  
Thus talking he did paſſe,

               Into the Temple ledde me forth
               and fayde: This Sacred Wall
               That here thou viewſt, is able well
               to make thée ſhewe of all.
               The wall was painted ful of Signes
               and Figures all about,
               All I remember not, my braine

               That Virgin can from darkned Skies,
               the duſkie cloudes remoue,
               She can to partched corne giue drinke
               to make the Harueſt proue.

And when hir liſt repreſſe the ſame
               againe in wondrous wiſe.
               She can (if be hir pleaſure) make
               the baraine ſoile and grounde
               As fatte as any paſture, and
               make it with grayne abounde.

               that worldly things bereaues
               Of bliſſefull ſtate, this Virgin can

               The rattlyng hayle ſhall nothing noye
               the Corne vpon the ſoyle.
               The houſe ſhall neuer fall by fyre
               or waſted be with flame:
               For now they ſay, the Skies procure
               and angrie ſtarres the ſame.
               Oh, if this Virgin be diſpoſde,
               ſhe can make all things ſure,
               If ſhe be frendly, corne ſhall fill
               the barnes, ſhe can procure
               Eche beaſt to bring a twinne to light
               to glad the maiſters minde,
               Yea and ſhe liſt, although the ſhéepe
               be drie and notte by kinde,
               
                  
She can enforce with twink of eye
               and becke of friendly browe
               The dugge to ſtrout with milke, y• back
               with wooll, and Lambes ynowe.
               She can remoue all vile diſeaſe

               She can tell how to cure the flocke

               Now néedleſſe is to follow Pan

FALCO.
            
               The Argument.
               HERE Faustul hauing throughly tryde
               the nature of the Romaine ground:
               The vileneſſe of the ſoyle, and Shephierds
               filthy manners doth expound.
            
            
               The ſpeakers names.
               Faustulus.
               Candidus.
            
            
               
               Fauſtulus.
               
                  O Candid howe befals
               that thou from natiue home
               A wight exilde in forraine land
               and ſtrangie Realme doſt rome?
               For here no Paſtures are
               nor Fountaines to be found,
               No ſafe Shéepecoates, no ſhrouding ſhades,
               to kéepe the cattle ſound.
            
            
               Candidus.
               Thus (Faustul) ſtands the caſe,
one Coridon that in
               Theſe quarters kept his flock, and by
               that meane great wealth did win,
               Draue me to déeme that here
               amyd theſe Mountaines was
               Moſt pleaſant Paſture for my Shéepe,
               and holſome vaine of graſſe.
               But ſithens now I ſée
               and plainly viewe with eye,
               The barren ground & Paſtures pielde,
               ſoile rockie, Fountaines drie,
               It yrks me that I came
               ſo raſhly out of dore,
               The iourneys long, and leauing of
               my Countrey grieues me ſore.

               Well ſince it was thy happe
               in ſafetie to attaine
               
                  
The Latine Paſtures, I would craue
               (if thou wilt take the paine)
               To my poore houſe to come,

               Than poorely will maintaine
               my lowe and néedie ſtate:
               But ſuch as 'tis, take parte I pray
               let runne in common rate.
               Perhaps ſome better hap
               and fortune will befall.
               For Chaunce reſembles much a blaſt
               of winde, to wauering thrall.
               Come to my ſedgie Coate
               till raging heate be paſt,
               And whilſt the flock layd downe on ſoile

               Do way the Shéepecrooke, ſit

               We néede to drinke, by drinke we ſhall

               for after drinke (they ſay)
               The tale with better grace is tolde
               it better goes away.
            
            
               
               Candidus.
               What mad man would in ſuch

               Fauſtulus.
               Yea, Wine doth quel the cruell thirſt
               if it be tippled vp.
               Wine doth diminiſh care
               and dolours of the minde:
               As wine bréedes friendſhips, ſo it doth
               augment the ſtrength by kinde.
            
            
               Candidus.
               This Countrey hath good Grapes,
               if ſo they here do growe.
               Fill out againe, the former draught
               is but a taſt you knowe.
               The ſeconde weates the iawes,
               the third doth coole the rage
               Of burning mouth, the fourth wt thirſt
               a cruel warre doth wage.
               The fift full fiercely fights,
               the ſixt doth conquer aye,
               The ſeauenth triumphs, Oenophilus

               As thirſt is baniſht, ſo

               Fill out the licour of the Grape,
               drincke fréely if you pleaſe.
               This Phyſick is to driue
               the heart pangs out of place.
               
                  Rome to abandon cruell cares
               this Medcine vſde like eaſe.

               All toile and trauaile craues

               Let bottle ſtande, and ſtoppe him cloſe
               to kéepe the Flies away.
               The day is nothing wette,
               not deawie is the night,
               Which makes that forrage cā not grow

               Fell famine, crueil toile,
               with heate of ſcortching aire
               Haue made the Cattle paſſing leane,
               and brought them in diſpaire
               Of euer being fat:
               ſcarce can they drawe their winde,
               Their guts are clung to emptie ſkinne,
               the bones ſticke out behinde.
               
                  
This Ramme that beate the Woulfe

               Thus much the Crow declarde
               with holy ſacred bill:
               But I was ouerhaſtly bent

And I poore wight in ſunder cruſht

               Now is our countrey ſtuft
               with wealth: what Medow grounds
               Haue we? What paſtures gréene as léeke
               within our Countrey bounds?
               O merrie ioyfull ſoile,

               And where through erie Village and
               eche Garden flouds do roonne.
               This makes the goodly flocks
               and Paſture fieldes ſo fatte.
               When crabbed Cancer rules, and men

               and ſound of trembling leaues,

               The aire that ſhooke the leauie boughs

               Aloft our heads the trée
that Cornus hight there hangde,
               Whoſe boiſtrous armes were all about
               with Berries brauely ſpangde.

               Deuoure vp all, firſt graſſe, and then

               With vpward reaching iawes

                  Rome is to men as to the birds

What time thou wandreſt in the wood
               thine eyes defende
               And garde with hat, for buſhie thornes
               their poinant pricks pretende
               To noy thy face, and if
               thou take not great good héede
               The crooked hanging brimbles will
               rent off thy crooked wéede.
               Do not away thy Crooke,

               The buſhie Groues are ful of Snakes,
               with bite they bréede our care,
               In daylie hazard of our liues,

               where ſo by chaunce it takes.
               A thouſand Wolues there be,

               The neighbour places laugh,

               Nor once will go about to ſtoppe
               this gréedie bloudie broile.
               And oftentimes appeare
               fell vglie ſhapes to ſight,
               Which earth by influence vile brings forth,
               ſometime the Dogs do fight
               And vſe ſuch cruell rage,
               as farre they do ſurpaſſe
               The tyrannie of bloudie Wolues:
               that route that rampire was
               And garde to flocks of yore,
               put on a wrathfull minde,
               And ſlay the ſiellie Cattle that
               their fortune is to finde.
               In Aegypt men report

               And as they trauaile in the way

               Of Romaine hils I heard,
of ſtately Tyber eake,
               And men of goodlie Romaine roofes
               and buildings earſt did ſpeake.

               Than Argus did that in his head
               a hundreth watchmen bare.
               And Daphnis not alone,
but that Apollo take
               That fed Admetus hierd in Theſſale

               Well worthie to ſuccéede
               and take the charge in hand
               Of Fiſher that forewent his nets,
               and kept his Shéepe at land.
               He knowes the way to garde
               his cattle, how to driue
               Diſeaſes from infected flocke,
               and ſaue his Lambs aliue:
               Moiſt eke the Paſture groundes,
               giue graſſe, let riu
                     •

               And reconcile the mightie Ioue,
               
               abandon théeuiſh foe.
               Beate off the barking Woulfe,
               that ſéekes the beaſts to kill.
               
                  
O Candid here make thy abode
if ſo be Falcos will:
               But if he once reſtraine
               his fauour and his grace,
               Driue thou away the hierde, and haſte
               to ſéeke a better place.
