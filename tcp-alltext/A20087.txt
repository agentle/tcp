               HAL Esquire.
            
               IF I put into your hands a homely peice of Worke (neither so good as you deserue, nor so rich as I do wish it) I must entreat you to blame the vanitie of our times which are so phantasticall, that they couet Stuffes, rather slight, to feede the eye with shew, then Substantiall for enduring. Let the Fashion be French it is no matter what the Cloth be. I haue therefo

               ot (with the Sturgeon) swomme against the streame; But followed the Humorous Tides of this Age, and (like Democritus) haue falne a Laughing at the world, sithence it does nothing but mocke it selfe. But seeing no creature is so wise as man, nor any so foolish, my Wits haue heere beene at charges to feast either sort. A mixt Banquet of Sweete and Sowre, Fulsome, and VVholesome, Seria cum Iocis,
               
stands furnished before them. In this Horse-Race there is no cheating, my Building (as many Rich mens great houses) is not onely to keepe Rats, and Spiders in it, but euery Roome (though all be but meane) hath some picture to delight you. The Plat-forme being narrow, I could raise no lofty Stories; for when the Ditty is light, the Aire must not be Graue; A Crow is not to build so high as an Eagle: as the Face of my Inuention was drawne, such I could not chose but proportion out the Body. Yet the Picture hath lost some of the Cullors I gaue it.
            I know you loue to Reade, because you know to Censure; Reade, this I pray as I writ it — (willingly,) and Censure, as I send it — (in Loue) Beare with the hard-fauourdnesse of the Title. The value of a Diamond is not lessened by the roughnesse when it is Vncut. It can bee no shame to gather a Violet, growing close to the ground. Had I better you should enioy it; such as it is if you entertaine, I shall rest.
            
               
                  Most affectionately deuoted Yours, THOMAS DEKKER.

               HE that writes, had need to haue the Art of a skilfull Cooke; for there must be those Condimenta (seasonings) in his pen, which the other caries on his tongue: A thousand palats must bee pleased with a thousand sawces: and one hundred lines must content fi

               e hundred dispositions. A hard taske: one sayes, it is too harsh another, too supple: another too triuiall: another too serious. The first reades, and mewes: the second reades, and railes: the third reades, and rackes me: the fourth reades, and rends me. He is tyed to a stake like a Beare to be baited that comes into Paules Church-yard to bee read. So that bare Readers (I meane not threed-bare) are not Lectores, but Lictores, they whip Bookes (as Dionysius

            The Titles of Bookes are like painted Chimnies in great Countrey-houses, make a shew a far off, and catch Trauellers eyes; but comming nere them, neither cast they smoke, nor hath the house the heart to make you

drinke. The Title of this booke is like a Iesters face, set (howsoeuer he drawes it) to beget mirth: but his ends are hid to himselfe, and those are to get money. Within is more then without; you shall not finde the kirnell, vnlesse you both cracke and open the shell. Aliquid latet, quod non patet: Digge vnder the right tree, and it is ten to one but you take vp gold: for in this (as in all other my former Nocturnis lucubrationibus) I haue stroue to feed the mind, as well as the body: If one leafe make you laugh, the next settles your countenance. Tart meates go easily downe, being strewd with sugar: as musicke in Tauerns makes that wine go downe merily, till it confound vs, which (if the Fidlers were not there) would hardly be tasted. So for the sake of the sawce which I haue tempered for this dish, you may (perhaps) eate the meat, which otherwise you would not touch.
            The maine plot of my building is a Moral labyrinth; a weake thred guides you in and out: I will shew you how to enter, and how to passe through, and open all the Roomes, and all the priuate walkes, that when you come to them, you may know where you are: and these they be— Y

               The like did Philippus Arabs the Emperour, at two seuerall times; the first at the celebration of the Circumcision Games (so called of Circus, the place where they were performed) At which time he turned out two and thirty Elephants, twenty Tygers, an hundred Hyenae

                  , one Rhynoceros, threescore tame Lyons, and ten curle-mained Lyons, ten Panthers, thirty Leopards, and ten fierce Horses to be cut in péeces.
            
               The second time was at the celebration of those games, which were held but once in a hundred yeares; and thereupon were called Ludi Seculares, (of Seculum, an age of a man, which was then counted an hundred yeares) their Solemnization being in honour of Apollo, and Diana. Against which day a Cryer went vp and downe the Citty of Rome,
               
                  Venite ad Ludos quos nemo mortalem vidit, neque visurus est.
                with this note: Whosoeuer will see games, which no man aliue hath euer seene, nor any man liuing shal euer see more, now let them come. At which time, the Rites due to that Celebration béeing performed, and the people of Rome in infinite numbers assembled together, he caused to bee hunted (besides the beasts before named, to as great or a greater number) ten horned Elkes more, by no other persons, then by two thousand Fencers, armed onely with their Swords in their hands, the beasts running loose, madding and roaring vp and downe.

a goale proposed and left there:

               The third Race was to run and returne to and fro, from the marke to the goale, without intermission by the space of eight changes, and neuer vnder sixe: and he that could hold out his winde so long, to be first at the bounds where he began his race, carryed away both garland and prizes.

            It is (because you shall weary your eyes with staring no longer) A Race or Challenge betwixt the Uertues that dwell in the little world (Man) and the Uices to whom hee giues free entertainement;
                  Vertue & Vice run.
                they are all ready to present their Troupes, and to do their Deuoire: But before they enter the lists, (some on horse-backe, some on foote, some in Chariots) I will play the Herauld to marshall them in order, according to their quality and worth, and send them forth, marching in braue equipage before you.

               The Vertues are not Mounted, and haue Few Followers, they haue no Plumes, and so, no Pride; their Attire is decent, sober, girt to them, and ciuill: their Faces graue, austere in very swéetenesse, swéete in austerity; fairest when they are neerest; louely a farre off, and all open; vsed to no maske, their pace demure, maiestically-humble, constant and comely.
            
               
                  Vice is euer mounted.
               The Vices are Gallant Fellowes, they are Mounted, and haue no small Fooles to their Followers: they haue Plumes, like Estridges, and Perfumes like Muske-cats, (so strong) they are soone smelt out: for Attire, they carry Lordships on their backes, a Knights liuing in their Bréeches, & a Shop-kéepers wealth in a Hat-band, Garters, and Shoestrings; Their Faces light,

                  Other Races.
               Then came in two by two, other Troopes, whose onsets, and ouer-throwes, honours, and disgraces, darings, and dauntings, merit an ample Chronicle, rather then an Abstract; of all which the Braggadochio-vices still got the worst: the Vertues departing in Triumph, but not with any insulting. And thus the glory of this Race ended.
            Now, as after the cleare streame hath glided away in his owne current, the bottome is muddy and troubled. And as I haue often s
                  •
               ene, after the finishing of some worthy Tragedy, or Catastrophe in the open Theaters, that the Sceane after the Epilogue hath béene more blacke (about a nasty bawdy Iigge) then the most horrid Sceane in the Play was: The Stinkards speaking all things, yet noman vnderstanding any thing; a mutiny being amongst them, yet none in danger: no tumult, and yet no quietnesse: no mischife begotten, and yet mischiefe borne: the swiftnesse of such a torrent, the more it ouerwhelmes, bréeding the more pleasure.
            So after those Worthies and Conquerours had left the field, another Race was ready to begin, at which, though the persons in it were nothing equall to the former, yet the shoutes and noyse at these was as great, if not greater. They marched in no order, and that made them séeme comely; Handsomenesse in them had beene a disgrace, the worse they shewed, the better they were liked: They could do nothing ill, because they could doe nothing well, and were therefore commended, because there was in them nothing commendable: Such praise

as they brought, they caried away; and this it was.
            The first Troope that came thronging in,
                  Belly-gods.
                were a company of braue staring fellowes, that looked like Flemings, for they were as fat as butter, and as plumpe in the face as Trumpeters are when their chéekes swell like bladders. No horses could bee hired for them: for (as Gallants doe Citizens) they were sure to breake their backes: they were all Foot-men therefore, and ran very heauily (like men going to hanging) because if they should fall, their bellies making them leape heauy, they were sure to breake their necekes. These termed themselues Epicures,
               
                  Of Epicurus, from whom sprang that Sect.
                and all that heard them beléeued it: for their Guts was their God, their Heads, Hogsheads of wine, their Bodies, Cages for wild-fowle, and their Soules nothing else but the steame and breath of roasted Capons serued vp piping bot. These ran into a thousand mens Debts, but ran so farre one from another, (for feare of breaking Ribbes if they had iustled) that they would be sure neuer to run in any certaine danger.
            The last Race they ran (for you must know they had many) was from a cry of Sergeants: yet in the end the Law ouer-tooke them, and after a long, sweaty, and troublesome Race, ouer-threw and layd them in the dust; they dyed in prison, and were buryed in silence.
            After them came in a pert Lawyer,
               
                  A Lawyer and his conscience run.
                puffing and blowing (one that for putting a wrench into the Lawes mouth, to force her to speake any thing, was pitched ouer the barre) and hee can really: but with whom thinke you? against this owne Conscience: but in the Race (sweat and sweare, do what he could) she gaue him the slip, tired him extreamely, and was still out of his reach the length of Gracious street, at the least; yet the Lawyer was a goodly man, strong, and full of action,

and his Conscience nohing in the world to speake of.
            
               
                  A Vicar.
               The next was one that should haue beene a scholler, and was indéed, and he ran horrible fast after foure Benefices all at one time, they held him nobly to it a long space; but with much adoe hee got beyond them, and wonne what he ran for: Mary hee caught such an incurable cold (by reason of his pursinesse) that hes lost his voyce presently, and grew by degrees, so hoarse, that he neuer spake after to any great purpose, all his lights we

                  A Taylor runs with Pride.
               At last comes skipping in a terse, spruise, neatified Capricious Taylor, new leaped from his Shopboord, and the Diuill could not perswade him, but hee would runne with Pride, and with none else. Pride was for him, and tooke hold of him presently, Horses were offered to them both: No (sayd the Taylor) I will not bee set on Horfe-backe, I will not ride, nor be ridden: Pride scorned any courtesie more then he. To it they go then; Pride got still before him, and he followed her at an ench like a mad-man, tooth and nayle. In the end hee had her at his backe: Pride then (for anger that any should out-strip her) made such extreame haste, that shee caught a fall. The Taylor (hauing many gallant parts of a Gentleman about him) looking aside, and seeing his Incounterer downe, came brauely to her, offering to take her vp, which she disdaining, allowed him a yard before her, which hee was content to take, and to it they go againe: Pride followed him close, and comming home vp to him, spyed her aduantage (being neere the Races end) and leaping forward, hit him full at the heart, and so ouerthrew him. Inraged at which, hee drew out a Spanish weapon, and would haue runne it through her; shee put him by, and cut his combe, which so cut his heart (to see a woman his confusion)

that hee was neuer his owne man afterward. But he sayd hee wrought his owne woe himselfe, and confest it was his owne seeking to meddle with her; and therefore such bread as he brake, was but broken to him againe, yet swore (if a man might beleeue him) that though he sunke into hell for it, he would, at one time or other, sawce her.
            This quarrell made peace; for the vn-rauelling of this bottome, was the last thréed that ended all. You now see what voyage this ship of fooles (in which these last were imbarked) hath made. Heere cast they Anchor, and leap on Shore.
         
         
            A preparation to the Masque ensuing, and the cause therof.
            FAME,
                  A newes spred.
                who hath as many tongues as there are mouthes in the world, hearing of the honourable defeature giuen by those worthy Champions to to their ignoble (but insulting) enemies, could not choose (because shee is a woman, but pratile of it, in all places, and to all persons; insomuch that the Courts of Kings rang of it Cities made bone-fires for it, the Country had almost broke all their bels about it: at euery Crosse it was proclaimed, at euery Market, one word went about the price of victuals, and flue about that: Barbers had neuer such vtterance of a newes, Booke-sellers sold more sheetes then Linnen-drapers; Carriers could load their horses with no Packes but of This: No Ship went to Sea, but some part of the fraight was this victory: It was written of at home, dispersed

in letters abroad, and sung to a new Tune euery where. Omitting these hither parts of Christendome, she (Fame I meane) taking her Trumpet (because she is Times Herald) flew with it ouer the Mediterranean-sea into Asia, first into Turkey, so to Caldaea, Persia, Hircania, Assiria, Armenia, and then getting vp higher ouer the Caspian sea, away shee poasted to the Tartars, and Cathayans, then to the Chynois, and other East Indians, so backe againe ouer the Arabian Sea, into Arabia Foelix: then crossing ouer Numidia, her next cut was into Barbary in Affrica, from thence downe to Noua Guinea; and from thence crossing the Lyne into the Ethyopian sea, away swoopes shee by Brasill, and so beates her Wings in the West Indies, whose heate being ready to melt her, (as the East Indies did before) ouer the Lyne againe she scuds to Noua Hispania, & so to the Northward of America: then homeward through Florida, taking Virginea, Noua Francia, Norembega, and all those Septentrionall Countries in her passage, and so crossing the Deucalidonian sea, hauing beaten her selfe almost to death in proclaiming and trumpeting lowdly the News, she pantingly ariues where shee set forth, pruning and péecing vp her flagging and broken Wings.
            
            The winds caching her breath in all kingdoms, through which she went, were as great with it as her selfe, & ready to burst vntill they were deliuered. Neuer was such puffing & blowing, such blustring & roaring, since they threw downe Babel:
                  The naturall cause of an earth-quake.
                so that with their strugling who should cry out first, they were all brought a bed of it at one time: for all of them breaking by force into the bowels of the earth, and by that irrruption tearing her very foundation with an vniuersall earth-quake, the massy frame was cleft & riuen asunder, and so the terror of the report was by the wherrying winds shot (as if with a thunder-bolt from heauen) and neuer tarryed, or met any rub, till it burst open the Gates of infernall Erebus.
            
            
               The Grand-Sophy of the Satanicall Synagogue,

                at the very sound of it belchd out a groane, the rebound of which (like one bandogs whyning in Paris Garden, setting all the Kennels a barking) left all the Stygian Hel-hounds in a most clamorous howling. The dismall consort hauing (with a worse noise then the grating and crashing of Iron when it is a

               yling) ended these Blacke Sants, & shooke their gastly heads foure or fiue times together, & with chaines ratling at their heeles, (as if so many blacke Dogs of New-gate had beene mad in a Tauerne there) ran bellowing All, about their Father of Mischiefe, to know what Qualme came ouer his stomake. He (darting an eye vpon them, able to confound a thousand Coniurers in their owne Circles, (though with a wet finger they could fetch vp a little Diuell) and with an Vlulation, (his chin almost bursting his breast-bone with a Nod) from which, fum'd out a breath (blacker then sea-coale smoake out of a Brew-house chimney) which if their withered chaps had bin there, yawning to sucke it downe was of power to haue turned ten thousand old Beldams in Lapland into the rankest Witches) Hee thus grumbled: Hel's vndone,
               
                  Hels Army defeated.
                Why, yelped all the rest? An Armada (quoth he) cannot saue vs, our Legions (in the world next aboue vs) are ouerthrowne by that Stigmaticall Virago Vertue: All those Battalions that warred vnder ye cullors of our Red & fiery Dragō are debaushed: Suffer this bracke into our Acheronticke Territories; & hotter Assassinations will euery day pel mel maule vs. Al about him cryed they would neuer endure it.
            Whilst this indisgested mischiefe lay broyling on their stomackes, roome was made for an Intelligencer newly arriu'd vpon these stronds of Horror. It was one of those nimble Vmbratici Daemones,
               
                  Paracelsus de gnomis.
                as inuisible as the Aire, & (like Aire) neuer out of our company, one of those Gnomi, whose part Theophrastus Paracelsus takes so terribly,

prouing that whether we swmme, or are on land, or in the woods, or in houses, wee are still haunted with a spirit or two at least, neither hurtfull nor doing good, and such a One was This: Belial Belzebub of Barathrum, had lately employed this Purseuant of his about serious businesse;

                in which hauing done nothing, and dreading but sorry paiment for his labour, hee knew not how better to escape the Furies, then by forging some egregious lies, by the same Anuile, that all hell was now striking (that's to say, touching the late victorie of the Vertues) and so to bee thought hee had spent all his time in that intelligence.
            He therefore being tossed, (the throng was so great) vpon their glowing flesh-hookes, from one to one, till hee came before the grand Cacodemon, (his Maister) who sate in a chaire all on fire, downe fell my little spirit flat at his clouen feete: and then, the Captaine of Damnation, (hauing first spit out foure or fiue Blasphemies, which one of his Gentlemen Ushers still trod out) hee gnashed his teeth, and asked if the newes were current: it was replied, yes.

they are pur-blind) my Ouerseers, and for their paines therein, I will bequeath to each of them a great round Pearle, to be worne in their eyes, because I may be still in their sight, when I am gone from them.
            And to testify that this is my last and onely Will which shall stand, I subscribe my Name vnto it, thereby Renouncing, Retracting, Reuocating, Disanulling, & quite Cancelling, all former Wils whatsoeuer by mee at any time or times made; In witnesse whereof all the States Infernall; Auernall, Acheronticke, Stygian, Phlegetonticke, and Peryphlegitonticke, haue likewise subscribed, in the yeare of our Ranging in the World, 5574.
            
               Mounsieur Nouerint (being a man, whose conditions were too well knowne) had nothing said to him at this time,
                  Although there be, Vestigia nulla retrorsa out of Hell, yet you must know hee had a conueiance for that purpose, to haue ingresse and egresse.
                because the Diuell was very bad, and had no stomacke to talke of old Reckonings (for Vniuerse was in his debt) but had his payment, and was glad he got away.
            Now, as it often happens to rich Curmudgeons, that after they haue settled their estates on their death-beds, (as they verily feare) and that their wiues gape day and night to be widdowes, that from their husbands

            Heereupon, a Synode was called of all the subtillest and plaugiest prates in Hell, (of which there are good store) Magog Mammon, there discouers his disease, the cause of it, and the perill; his feare is that his Kingdome would now bee sorely shaken, and his sorrowes, because all they should be sure to smart for it more then he himselfe, hee therefore craues their infernall counsell.
            They sit, they confer, they consult, and from that consultation (after many villanous proiects tosd on their hornes like dung vpon Pitch-forkes, and smelling worse) this Aduice was hatched, and had fethers stucke on the backe, the rest were pluckt naked; And this it it was, That Minotaure Polyphem (the Sire of all those Whelpes barking thus in the Kennels of Hell) should forth-with put fire into his old Bones, and fall to threshing of their Damme, to get more Hell-hounds, (braue yong little Diuels) whom hee may (like Tumblers) hoyst from one Fiends shoulder vp to another, and so pop them into the world: And they againe going to Bull, with other blacke Goblins, may ingender, what monsters they please to set all the world and all the people in it out of tune, and the worse Musicke they make, the more sport it is for him.
            This Act was Filed vpon Record: most Uoyces carried it away; the Councell flowed currant, the Court is adiourned, and the great Beglherby of Lymbo fals

               Aldip Alambat, their father gaue them their names, the one was called Hypocrisie, the other Ingratitude. Hypocrisie was put to nurse to an Anabaptist of Amsterdam, but Ingratitude was brought vp at home. In a short time they battend, and were plunipe as fat Chop-bacons they were, and toward to practise any trickes that were shewed them.
            So that béeing ripe for maisters, Hypocrisie was presently bounded a Puritane Taylor, by his Nurle, and did nothing but make Clokes of Religion for to weare, of a thousand colours. Hee ran away from the Taylor, and then dwelt with a Uizard maker, and there hee was the first who inuented the wearing of two faces vnder a hood. After this hee trauelled into Italy, and there learned to embrace with one arme, and stabbe with another to smile in your face

            Out of Germany hee is againe come ouer into England, his lodging is not certaine: For (like a whoore) hee lyes euery where. Hée sometimes is at Court, and is there excéeding full of complement,
                  The picture of an hypocrite.
                hee goes sometimes like a threed-bare Scholler, with lookes humble, as a Lambes, and as innocent, but his heart prouder then a Turkes to a Christians.
            
            
               Hee hath a winning and bewitching presence, a sweete breath, a musicall voyce, and a warme soft hand. But it is dangerous to keepe company with him,
                  Fistula dulce canit, &c.
                because he can alter himselfe into sundry shapes. In the Citty hee is a Dogge, and will fawne vpon you: In the fields hee is a Lyons Whelpe, and will play with you: In the Sea hee is a Mer-mayd, and will sing to you. But that fawning is but to reach at your throat: that playing is to get you into his pawes, and that singing is nothing else but to sink and confound you for euer.
            This picture of Perdition (Hypocrisie) was not drawne so smoothly, so cunningly, and so enticingly, but his brother (Ingratitude) though there went but a paire of Sheares betweene them,
                  Ingratitude pictured.
                was as vgly in shape, and as blacke in soule: hee was a Fiend in proportion, and a Fury in condition. It is a monster with many hands, but no eyes: It catcheth at any thing, but cannot see the party from whom it receiues. This is that follow made all the Diuels at first, and still supplyes their number continually.

            At the birth of euery one these Monsters, were particular Triumphes, but aboue all the rest, one had the glory to be graced with a Masque, and it was at an vpsitting, when the Gossips and many great States were there present.
            
               It was a Morall Masque,

The swallowing of the baytes was (to those Soules) a pleasure, and their skipping to and fro, when they were whipped, made all Hell fall into a laughing. One of those baytes was Promotion, the second was Gold, the third Beauty, the fourth Reuenge, the fift a pipe of Tobacco: and such rotten stuffe were all the rest.
            The Daunce was an infernall Irish-hay, full of mad and wilde changes, which (with the Masquers) vanished away as it came in, (like vnto Agryppaes shadowes.)

            A Catch-poll is one that doth both catch and poll:
                  What a Catchpoll is.
                who is not content onely to haue the sheepe, but must sheare it too; and not sheare it, but to draw bloud too. So then by this Etymology of the word,
                  Their Species.
                any one that sinisterly wrests and serues Monopolies into his hands, to all his Coffers, (though his owne conscience whispers in his eare, that hee beggers the Common-wealth) and his Prince neuer the better for it: but the poore Subiects much the worse: Hee is a Grand Catchpoll.
            
            Any one that takes Bribes, and holds the Scales of Iustice with an vn-euen hand, laying the rich mans cause (be it neuer so bad) in the heauy scale, and the poore mans (be it neuer so good) in the light one, hée is a Catch-poll.
            
            A Pastor, that hauing a Flocke to féede, suffers them to breake into strange fields, lets them stray he cares not how; be dragged away by the Wolfe, he regards not whither: séeth them sicke and diseased, and will not cure them; hee is a Catch-poll.

            So is a Soldier, that makes bloud, rapes, lust and violence his proper ends; and not Gods quarrell, his Princes right, or the honour of his Country.
            So is a Citizen, that cozens other men of their goods, and

               els bad ware in a blind shop, to honest Customers,

of which they neuer are able to make the one halfe: yet if they breake their day, hee will let them rot in prison rather then release them.
            And lastly, that Prentice, who robs his maister, and spends his substance vpon Harlots; hée is a Catch-poll as egregious as the best.
            Out of these Rankes were those Hot-shots (the Masquers) drawne, whom I leaue to double their Files by themselues, because I sée the Reare-ward comming vp, and I must likewise teach them their Postures.

            To stoppe all these mouthes with Sugar-plumes,

you must needs thinke, would aske a huge charge; but they who vndertake the cost, respected not the expence, for they had not onely coyne of their owne enough, but they had shragd others too of theirs, and being hunted from corner to corner in the world, hither (into the Iland of the Bermudes haunted as all men know with Hogs and Hobgoblings) came they for shelter,

And thus the Bankrouts themselues (to adde more State to the Ceremony) come marching with their Suckets, &c. in order.
            
               
                  The Bankrouts banquet.
               First, the vpper end of the Table was such 
                  〈◊〉
                with the heauiest, costliest, and cunningst Bondes that could be got,
                  Bondes, a binding meate.
                for loue, wit, or mony; and they were heaped vp with Cynamon Comfits. (Cynamon being an extreme Bynder;) and of this Banquetting Dish was such store, that it ran cleane through the Board.
            
               
                  Bils, binders too.
               Next, came in Bils Obligatory, (a thousand in a cluster) and they were filled with Conserues of Slowes, and

other Stipticke sweete meates.
            After these in most Iudiciall manner, and with great pompe and charge,
                  Statutes dangerous meats.
                were Statutes serued vp: and they were laden with Candyed Ering
                     ••
                  s▪
                of purpose to put spirit into him that should eate of this dish, and to keepe him vp, because, if hee sinke or grow sicke with chewing downe or swallowing of Statute, he

            Iust in the taile of those,
                  Defeysance cō
                     fortable to the stomacke.
                were brought to the Table a goodly company of Defeazances, and they held delicate Flakes of White and Red Iellies, being both Restoratiue, and very loosing to the stomake, and good against those Binding and Restringent dishes, which came in first, at the vpper end of the Table this dish should haue bene serued vp, but it had a mischance.
            After all this,
                  Latitats no sweetnesse in them.
                a C

                  pias with a Latitat, went from one to one, but none touched those dishes, yet they were heaped full to the brim with Sugar-pellets, and cakes of Gynger-bread piled round about them;
                  Hot in the mouth and biting.
                But the Pellets when they were shot did scarce hit, and the Gynger so bit their tongues, and set their mouths in a heat, that none at the Table toucht them, but shifted them one from another.
            At the last, Attachments appeared in their likenesse,
                  Attachments a heady-drinke.
                and they were fild into bottels of Hypo

                  as, and other strong Wines, able to lay hold of a

            Next those dishes, were brought in, a number of Outlaries,
               
                  Outlaries are terrible Purges.
                thwackt with Purging-Comfits, for they are able to make a man flye ouer nine hedges.
            And below them stood Iudgements,
               
                  Iudgements lie heauy in the stomacke.
                full of newbakt Diet-bread, and therefore hard for the stomack
                  •
                to disgest.
            
               
               
                  Executions a very sowre meate and vnwholsome.
               But close by them were placed Executions, which cloyed euery ones stomacke there; for they were Tarts of of seuerall Fruites, stucke with Muske-comfits of purpose, to sweeten the mouth, if any should happen to lay his lippes to sowre a dish.
            
               
                  Ne exeat Regnum good to stay a running.
               The last Banquetting-
                  〈◊〉
                (saue one) were Ne exeat Regnum, and those were heaped to the top with Annis-seed-comfits, being exceeding good to procure Long-winds, if a man haue a minde, or bee forced to Run his Country.
            
               
                  Protections wholesome & comfortable.
               The last of all were Protections, some larger then other; and when these came in, a shoute was giuen, for all the Bankrouts slung vp their caps, and bid their Guests profaces, for now they saw their Cheere. In those Protections lay March-panes, which shewed like Bucklers, ye long Orange-comfits standing vp like Pikes, & in the midst of euery March-pane a goodly swéet Castle, all the bottomes being thickely strewed with Careawaies. And this was the Bankrouts Sybariticall Banquer.
            
            The queint casting of the dishes so brauely, all in wax was wondred at, the working, tempering, moulding, and fashioning of the Sweete-meates were commended, the conceipt of Furnishing the Table extolled, the cost well liked off, and the Bestowers, not reward with common thankes, for the Grand-Signior of the triple worse called the Bankrouts his White Sonnes, and swore a Damnable Oath, that hee himselfe would haue an Eye ouer them.
            And so, after hee and his Bash

Hell, of the sweete-meate-scraps, left after the Ban-quet.
            The Feasters being dispersed, the maisters of the Feast, (the Bankrouts) held in a knot together: it was told them, there was beating at the gates to speake with them. All went to sée: and who was it but the Comfitmaker, that trusted them with his stuffe, and brought a bill of three-score and odde pounds, requesting to haue his money. His Pay-maisters told him this was no world to part from money, but to get as much as euery man could into his owne hands: other men did so, and so would they, their elders read them that lesson, and they must take it out. If he would take two shillings in the pound, they would pay him downe vpon the na

            The poore rotten-tooth'd Comfit-maker, et these out-of-tune notes, was ready to run out of his wits: Hee rapt at the gates, swore, cursed, and railed; Are you m

                Almonds, and I would they were burning red-hot in your bellies too.
            The more sowre his language was, the more sweet it was to them: for they did but laugh to heare him curse, and went their wayes: He séeing no remedy, swore hee would rattle all hell about their eares if they bod'd him off thus: And so betwéene scolding and whining, he thus tooke his peny-worths of them in words, though not in siluer.
                  Men that are forc'd to break are to be pittied.
               
            
            If (fai

                ship-wracke at sea, or by the villany of Debitos on the land, or by the frownes of the world, or the falsenesse of seruants, I should pawne my shirt from my backe to releiue you; but you burst vpon knauery, cheating and roguery.
            
               
                  An inuectiue against voluntary and cofening bankerouts.
               You that thus vndermine your owne estates, (with other mens) your selues, are like trées standing in your next neighbours ground, which you climbe in the darke, & gathering the fruit (like théeues) run away with it by Moone-shine. But if your states were weake for want of ability to pay, then are you those tree that (in your owne ground) are beaten with stormes, whose apples are shaken downe spitefully on the earth, and are deuoured by such Hoggish debters before the true Owners can come to take them vp and if so, you are to be pittied and releeued. You tell me you will breake:
                  Their good name lost.
                do so, breake your neckes. But before you do so, make this account, that you are as bad as halfe hanged; for you haue an ill, and a most abhominable name: try else.
            
               
                  Who is a Bankrout.
               A Bankrout, that is to say, a Banker-out: A Citizen that deales in mony, or had mony in Banke, or in stocke, He is out (when he Breakes:) But me thinkes hee is rather In. I sée no reason we should say, he breakes, there is more reason to cry out, He makes all whole, or hee makes vp his mouth,
               
                  The life of a Bankrout.
                (as you haue done with my plums) or he gets the diuell and all. For what doe you, but lye grunting in your flyes, like Hogges, and sat your ribbes with fruits of other mens labours. In my opinion you should feare the bread you eate should choke you, because it is stolne; the drinke you swallow should strange you, because you quaffe the bloud of honest housholders: and that the wine you carowse should dam you, because (with it) you mixe the teares of mothers, & the cries of children.
            If a Rogue cut a purse, hee is hanged: if pilfer, hée is burnt in the hand: You are worse then Rogues; for you

cut many purses:
                  The 
                        〈◊〉
                      of a Bankrout.
                Nay, you cut many mens throats, you steale from the husband, his wealth: from the wise her dowry: from children their portions. So that ouer your heads hang the curses of Families: how then can you hope to prosper? For to play the Bankrout, is to bid men to a Citty-rifling, where euery one puts in his money, and none wins but one, and that is the Bankrout.
            
            If all the water in the Thames were inke,
                  The villany of Bankrouts can not be expressed.
                and all the fethers vpon Swans backes were pens, and all the smoky sailes of westerne barges, were white paper, & all the Scriueners, all the Clarkes, all the Shoole-maisters, & all the Scholers in the kingdome were set a writing, and all the yeares of the world yet to come, were to be imploied only in that businesse: that inke would be spent, those pens grub'd close to the stumps, that paper scribled all ouer, those writers wearied, and that time worne out, before the shifts, legerdemaines, conueiances, reaches, fetches, ambushes, traines, and close vnder-minings of a Bankrout could to the life be set downe. This was the last winter-plum the sad Comfit-maker threw at their heads; and so left them, and so I leaue them.
            
               
                  My Muse that art so merry,
                  When wilt thou say th'art weary?

                  This flight thou couldst keepe euer:

                  Beyond thy bownds thee cary.
