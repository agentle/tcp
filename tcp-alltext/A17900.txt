England, Fraunce, and Ireland, your
humble obedient ſubiecte and ſeruaunt
Iames Canceller, one of your highenes
moſt honorable Chapple, wyſheth

               MOſt gracious
& deare Souerayne
Lady:
as the children
of Iſrael
in ye Deuteronomy
were
commaunded to appeare before
God, not with emptie handes:

but to offer to his diuine Maieſtie,
ſuch thinges as their power
was able to ſupplie, in token of
their dewe obedience, and loyal
ſubiection, as of whom they receiued
al goodnes, ſo they ought
to render part to the geuer of al
Euen ſo it be houeth al faythfull
ſubiects to behaue thē ſelues towardes
theyr king & gouernor:
eſpecially thoſe that dayly attēd
in ſeruynge of their deare ſoueraine
lord and king, and receiue
their lyuynge at their Prynces
bountiful, & moſt liberal hādes,
To whō, for acknowledging of
their Princes goodnes, as they
comenli render not part of their
liuing, for that neither can they
ſpare it, ne yet the Prince neede
it: ſo oughte they ſome meane to
deuiſe whereby their good wyll
and 
                  •
               ial ſubiection may wel appeare

to their king & maiſter to
whom thei are moſt boūden. In
the number of your dayly attendant
ſeruaunts, moſt gracius ſoueraine,
am I, moſt bounden to
your highnes, To whō my lowly
obedience better I coulde not
ſignify, then to deuiſe & endight
ſom what of true obedience. Nether
could I preſēt to your highnes
any thinge of my pore ſtore,
more acceptable then ye, wherby
houſholdes, cities, cōmēweales
& Realmes are only enriched, &
moſt happely gouerned & mayntained.
The contrarye whereof
hath brought thinges in a fewe
daies to greter ruine, then wiſe
and politicke heades could raiſe
& eſtabliſhe in a nūber of yeres.
I nede not herein to make anye
diſcorſe of old ſtories, neither of
Rome, Carthage, Athenes, or

Lacedemon: ſynce, euen here at
home, in myne owne countrey,
wyth myne owne griefe, I haue
ſeene ſuche hurt by diſobedience
to haue happened to englād this
little Iland, that hath drawen
all Europe not only to admiration
but alſo to lamentation, for
that the beautye of thys land by
diſobedience hath beene ſo defaced
& the grouud of al wealth ſo
ſhaken, that all other Nacions
by Englande might take example,
to exchew the occaſion of the
lyke Ruine. The woundes that
we therby haue receiued, beynge
nowe by God cloſed vp, & continualli
with the oile of your graces
goodnes, bathed & ſuppled,
at this preſente to open againe,
I much mind not ſeing, that the
touchinge of on ſinewe not perfitlye
healed maye dyſturbe the

hole body: and yet I thoughte it
not vnmete to treate of, in ſuche
wiſe, as the reader may wel vnderſtand,
what a fowle, and vgly
monſter diſobediēce is: whoſe
faire pretenſed enterpriſes pleaſant
to the vnwiſe in the beginning,
in the end brynges the folowers
to vtter cōfuſion, much
like the poiſon of a ſcorpion rolled
together in the forme of a pil
ſugred rounde aboute, and ſo receiued
into the bodye to purge yt
ſame, in ſteede of purgation brī
               geth
preſente deathe. To whoſe
diſpleaſātnes and wreched end,
true obedience compared, ſhall y•
better, wyth her ſwetnes allureech
perſō to walke in her vertuous
pathe. And as by cōtraries
moſt thinges we tryed, ſo by cō
               parīg
theſe two moſt contraries
together: the falſhoode of them

ſhalbe fullye dyſcloſed: and the
vertue of the other playnely ſet
foorth. In whyche myne enterpriſe,
mooſte Gracious Soue-Ladye
the wante of learnynge
lette my good wyll ſupplye,
whyche I Dedicate too youre
highnes, rather that other may
receiue it the better, commynge

            The pathe
            
               AS it is neceſſarye
that in the Churche
of God & in the wall
publike, and in euery
of them there bee dyuers
degrees of eſtates, & as we
alſo are moſte aſſured that god
hath ſo ordained for both of thē,
as in his Churche Archbiſhops
biſhoppes, preachers, and miniſters,
And likewiſe in the weale
publike, Emperoures, Kynges
and maieſtrates with other inferior
officers to them: So it is
alſo neceſſary that euery ſubiect
doe reuerently honor and obeye
them, as ordayned of God (and
not as of men) for the gouernement
of both of thē. For as God
hath appointed al other inferior
creatures for mā, and to be obedient
to man, ſo god moſt chefely
would man to be obedient to his

wil and comaundement. For as

ſayeth our curſed & diſobediente
libertines? euē as Lucifer ſaid among
the Aūgels in heauen, perſwadinge
vs that they were the
worthy paſtors that oughte to

therein the exāple of the
proud & diſobedient Lucifer, and
gouerner of their curſed church,
who proudly ſayd: I wil aſcend

And if god therfore did not ſpare
his aungels, but for their tranſgreſſion
& diſobedience did caſte
them forth of heauen,ii. Petr. ii. what deſerueth
then man, whō god hath
made lyke vnto hym ſelfe (& for
whoſe ſake hee garnyſhed the
whole earthe wyth all maner of
pleaſaunte thynges) and yet is
diſobediente againſt his Lorde
God & his annointed? Sayncte
Paule telleth vs,Ephe, v. the wrathe of
God. Whiche is an horible ſayinge,
and yet it is moſt true, as
by exāple: when God had made
Adam a parfyte man, & ſet hym
in the pleaſaunte garden of Paradiſe,
                  
                     ••
                  ne. iii
wherein was planted al
manner of fruite delicyous too
eate, he ſayde vnto Adam: of all
the fruit in the gardē thou ſhalt
eate, one onely excepted, whiche

deth in the middeſt of the gardē
of that thou ſhalt not eat: if thou
eate therof, thou ſhalt dy. There
was laid before Adam the bleſſing
and the curſe.deutro. xi. The bleſſyng
if he were obediente, the curſe if
he were not obediente:i, eſdra, iiii ſo ye god
did ſet before hym good & euell,
to choſe of thē whiche he would,
yet Adam for want of grace, at
fewe woordes to hym ſpoken by
his wife Eue, who before hadde
conferred with the ſubtil ſerpēt,
choſe that was euil, and did eat
of the fruite whereof God ſaide
he ſhould not eate: diſobediently
brekynge therby the wyl & commaundement
of his Lord God,
whereby they bothe loſt the original
innocency which they had
at their creacion: & they whyche
before were moſt precyous and
pure in the ſight of god, at now:

become before god, hatefull and
odious. Thus by ye falſ ſuggeſtion
of the wily & dyſobedient ſerpent,
Man whiche was King &
Emperoure ouer all, loſt his ſoueraintie,
and ſo being ouerthro
wen was caſte into thys vale of
miſerable wrechednes, and ſo became
ſubiecte vnto death, ſinne,
and all other miſeries and infirmities.
Sainct Paule therfore
not forgetting the fal of Adam,Roma. v.
writteth to the Romaynes, ſaying:
through the diſobedience of
one man, many became ſinners
ſoo that dyſobedience broughte
ſinne, and ſinne broughte deathe
vnto Adam and hys hole poſteritie.
Lyke wyſe Cayne the firſt
ſonne of Adam hauinge a priuie
hatred againſt his brother Abel
maliciouſly ſlewe him contrarie
to the will of hys Lorde God.

And for ſo doing he was alſo accourſed
of God, ſo that Cayne,
for hys diſobediēce, was wrapped
by his euyll fact, in y• chaine
of his wickednes.
            For it is wrytten:Pro. v, the wycked &
diſobedient man, ſhalbe catched
in his owne curſed deuycis, and
alſo faſt fetered in the bandes of
his offēces, and ſo was this curſed
Caine. Thus by diſobediēce
ſinne ſo much encreſed, that god
repented the creacion of man,
determining that he, for the puniſhment
of ſinners, woulde deſtroye
the whole worlde, and ſo
God dyd (eayght perſons) Noe
his wife, his thre ſonnes & their
wyues, onelye excepted.Gene. xix. We do
reade alſo that when Loth was
commaūded to depart from Sodome
with hys wife and daughters,
he was forbydden of God

that he nor any of them ſhoulde
loke behind theym, but ſhoulde
go forwarde to that city whych
God had a poynted him to euyll
in: yet Loth his wyfe beīg ſumthynge
lyke vnto Eue, the wyfe
of Adam, contrary to goddes cō

called of God to go vnto Niniue

to tel them in what ſhort time

preuenting him in his iorney, ſo
ordained, that whē Ionas was

a wonderfull tempeſt, that all yt
were in the ſhyp, thoughte that
God had forſaken them. And vntyll

was accompted to hym a lawe,
and wrought that worke in him

and not vnder the law, did ſhew
vnto vs a great example of our
obedience, in obſeruynge of the

maunded nor yet written: but
onely by goddes ſinguler grace

and after the lawe was geuen,
he led and gouerned them:
and alſo after the lawe receyued
they were gouerned, without a kyng,
vntyll the time of Samuel
the Prophet, In whoſe tyme
the people beeyng deſierous to
be lyke vnto the Gentylles, called
vnto Samuell and ſayde: let

to haue a kinge, haue not caſte

            And Samuell dyd ſpeake vnto

And Samuel before the whole

was made holy vnto the Lord.
Here is to bee noted, gentle

kyndneſſe that God had to his

feare, and howe mercifullye he
did ſhow vnto thē by the mouth
of hys Prophete Yf neceſſitie
required to ſerue for a common

For as euery one body
hath one head whiche by witte
and reaſon gouerneth the hole
partes of the ſame bodye: ſo
GOD gaue vnto hys people
beyng but one whole bodye a
head to rule and gouerne them
as one bodye, and that they
as particuler partes of one
bodye and members to one
heade ſhoulde bee gouerned by

that heade, in caſe lyke: So god
gaue them a kinge to bee theyr
heade to reygne ouer them, and
that they as obedient ſubiectes
ſhould truely ſerue & obey him:
For it is written:

there bee knowen, that GOD
hadde lefte powre and auctoritie
in hys Churche, and that
the holye ghoſte ſhoulde bee
geuen to all people by layinge
on of handes by the holye fathers
and miniſters of Chriſtes
Church, for as CHRIST
hadde made thys promyſe to
hys Churche beefore he called
Paul, ſo he performinge the

ſame promyſe before made vnto
his churche, ſaynte Paule to
Ananias, at whoſe handes he
receaued baptiſme and the holi-ghoſt:
and by the ſame promyſe
and auctoritie do we receaue in
the church of god, at the handes
of his mynyſters, the forgeuenes
of our ſinnes.Iohn. ii.
            
            And ſaynte Paule alſo ſpeakinge
to the holy fathers at Epheſus,Actes .ii.
ſaide vnto them, take
hede vnto your ſelues, and to al
the ſtocke, amonge whome the
holye goſt hathe made you ouer
ſeers, to rule ye church & flocke
of god, the whiche he hath purchaſed
with his bloud. Marke
here, good countremen, how erneſtly
ſaynt Paule ſpeaketh of
the auctoritie of the church, calling
them ouerſeers and rulers
of the company and faythefull,
which chriſte hath purchaſed wt 
               
his bloud: & furthermore, I am
ſure ſaith ſaint Paule, of this,
that after my departinge ſhall
greuous wolues enter in amōg
you, not ſparinge the flocke, and
alſo of youre owne ſelues ſhall
menne aryſe, ſpeaking peruerſe
thinges to draw diſciples after
them. Haue not good contremē
the like Wolues entred among
vs in this realme? Grafting in
the vyneyard of our lord, thornes
and brambles, & alſo drawing
chriſtes members from the
true obedience and diſcipline of
their mother y• catholike church
As of late manye hath ryſen amonge
vs in this realme, and
eſpecially that preſumpteous he
retike Iohn Bale,Bale. who hath taken
no 
                  •
               inale trauaïle to hinder
through his abhominable hereſies,
the glory of Chriſtes goſpel.

As it doth appeare by diuers
and ſundry bokes by him made,
and ſpeciallye in his boke intiteled the vocacion of Iohn Balle
to ye biſhoprike of Oſſery where
he not a litle triumpheth of hys
daungerous trauailes whyche
he had in the ſame, not ſhaming
to compare himſelfe with holy
ſaincte Paul in troubles, in labours,
in perill of ſhipe wracke,
in perill of the ſea, in perill of
falſe brethrē, in peril of pirates,
robbers and murtherers. Thus
whileſt he is comparing himſelf
with the holy Apoſtle lyke a
mad harehead begynneth to ſay
why ſhoulde I ſhrinke or bee aſhamed to boſte as the Apoſtle
hath? who as it appereth in the
ſeconde to the Corinthians (ſaieth
he) dyd boſte of hys labours
perils and troubles in the goſpell.

And the lyke laboure and
perilles had I in my Iorneye
with no leſſe trouble then he
had from Ieruſalem to Rome,
ſauing that ſayeth he we loſte
not our ſhip, and in the .vii. lefe
and on the lefte ſyde he ſayeth,
I wryhte not this for that I
would receiue prayſe thereof,
But that I haue done it alſo to
declare my moſt earneſt reioice
in the ſame god, which by grace
hath called me, by perſecucyon
hath tried me, and of fauoure
hath moſt wōderfully deliuered
me. Here Frier Bale beginneth
craftely to perſwade with the
poore Chriſtians that GOD
hath deliuered him frō peril of
death by miracle as thoughe he
were called of god in theſe daies
to ſet vp a light in his churche:

but as that notable here tyke terinthus
did labour to put oute
of the Churche of God the true
lyght of the goſpell in the time
of the holy apoſtle Saint Iohn
ſo doth that ſhameles freer laboure
and trauaile all that he
may, lyke a falſe diſciple, to put
forth himſelfe & to tread downe
in theſe our dayes the true light
of the goſpell wherefore freer
Bale where you ſaye that god
wōderfully hath deliuered you
we Chriſtiens would that you
did vnderſtande that we take
your deliuerance from perils of
your enemyes to be lyke as the
common barratours doe ſtande
by the highe waye ſyde to take
and rob the true manne of hys
goodes and after doth flee from
towne to towne to ſaue themſelues.
So doe we well vnderſtande

you to be a notable heretike
a poſtata and runagate
whereby you are compelled of
neceſſite to runne with ye thefe
or murtherer frō Citie to Citie
and from contrie to contrie for
the aſſuraunce of your lyfe, but
ondoutedly If you had been as
you ſaye a true diſciple of Chriſt
and as felow lyke with Sainct
Paule as you wryght your ſelf
to be, when you by chaunce of
wether were dryuen into Douer
rode woulde lyke as Paule
did at Philippus haue ſet youre
fote on lande & preached ChriſteActes .xvi.
but contrary wyſe as you haue
writtē in the xl. lefe of your boke
and on the lefte ſyde you were
more deſirous to ſette youre
hande to a bill of fyfty poundes
more thē you were able to pay
to that ende you myghte be ſet

on lande in flaunders, for that
ye might 
                  •
               aue ſpedye trauayle
to the reſt of your viperous brethren
in Germany, wheras ye
ſaye you wer receaued with as
muche reioyce of your myraculus
deliueraunce (as you termeI
                     •
                  . xxviii
it) as was ſainct Paule at Apiphorum
of the Catholycke and
chriſtē brethren, thus this mad
frantike fryer Bale in the myddeſt
of his proude boſtinges, &
praiſinge him ſelfe, dothe ſaye.
If Helias, that wether driuen
runnagate remayne nowe in a
foren lande, I pray thee gentyll
reader marke here, how he hitteth
here the nayle on the head,
& of a falſe lying frier is becom
in this one point a true tale teller,
naming him ſelfe▪ Helias, wt 
this addiſcion, that wether driuen

runnagates, ſo hathe he
brought hymſelfe from the fellowſhip
of ſaint Paule to be as
he is, a runnagate, and fellowe
with the vnplacable enemies
of Chriſtes Churche, and
companion with Cerinthus the
enemye of trueth. And in the
concluſyon of hys Booke the.
xliiii. leafe and on the lefte ſyde
alſo, he hathe diuers comparyſones,
betwene the prophetes,
apoſtles, and the Churche of
Englande, and theſe are hys
woordes. What ſhall I ſaye
more? Iohn Baptiſt is nowe
derided in the priſon, and Ieſus
the ſonne of God is grenned at
vpon the croſſe, but contrarye
wyſe in Englande, mayſter
Bale, Iohn baptiſt is now deliuered
forth of pryſon. And IeIeſus

the ſonne of god is truely
worſhipped vpō the croſſe, and
moreouer he ſayeth: Paule in Athens
is hiſſed at, the poore apoſtles
are ſlyly laughed to ſcorne
But nowe in Englande praiſed
be our lord Ieſus Chriſt, Paule
is truely preached, & the Apoſtles
receaue theyr dew honoure,
and laſt of al he ſaith, Iohn the
ſonne of zebede is ſent into Pathinos,
whiles Cerinthus, Menander,
and Hebion play the heretikes
at home. But otherwiſe
I ſay, Iohn zebed is now receaued
forth of Pathinos in to England,
and Cerinthus, Menāder
and Hebyon, who triumphed in
Englande while Iohn was in
Pathinos, are nowe fledde in to
Germany to play the prophets
of heretikes there. The reſte of
Bales trachery I will omit at

this time & returne to my matter.
Saint Iohn ſpeakinge of
the notable heritike Cerinthus
doeth ſaye to his diſciples, beware
that you bath not your ſelues
in bathes, wherin Cerinthus
the enemy of truth hath waſhed
himſelfe, leſt by thē you be
infected with his vntruth, it is
good for vs therfore (good cuntrymē)
that we whom god now
hathe called from the bathes of
Cerinthus, do run with all our
minde, and with al our heart, in
to the lap of oure mother the catholike
churche, who with her
ſwete bathes wil waſh & clenſe
vs from al theſe wicked errors
whiche we haue learned of this
wicked church of Sathan, and
then ſhal we receue ſuch heuēly
moyſture as ſhal bring forth in
vs vnmouable obedience, ſaint

Paule ſayeth, vnhappye is that
grounde and nereſt to the curſe
of God, whiche when it receaueth
heauenly moyſtures, doth
bringe forthe none other thinge
but thornes and wedes: therefore
to auoide this great threatninge
of Saynt Paule, let vs y•
now are called by gods deuyne
grace, learn of Chriſt to be obedient,
who ſuffred for vs, leuīg
vs an example yt we ſhoulde folowe
his ſteppes, in whom was
no ſinne, he was obediēt to Ioſeph
his ſuppoſed father, and to
Mary hys naturall mother, he
alſo who was king of al, obediently
payed tribute to Ceſar for
him & Peter. Alſo this moſt abſolute
or ground of all vertues,
gaue vnto vs one notable example
of obedience, at the time of
his paſſion, what tyme he ſuffered

the Iewes to beate, and
ſcourge him, and ſpecially whē
he was brought before the wicked
Iudge Pilate,Iohn .ix. who ſaid vnto
him: knoweſt thou not that I
haue power to crucifie thee: and
haue power alſo to loſe thee?
Chriſte our ſauiour mekely anſwered
and ſayd: thou couldeſt
not haue power at all againſte
me except it were geuen the frō
aboue. Therfore S. Paul doth
ſay, ther is no power but of god
the people that be are ordayned
of god, & who that is of god wil
obey the power and ordinauncis
of god, as chriſt here for our
example was obediēt vnto Pylate,
whoſe power was of god,
and yet he was a wycked iudge
much more we chriſtiās hauing
thys example of oure ſauyoure
chriſt ought of our boūdē duties

to be obedient to our moſt vertuous
King, Quene, and maieſtrates,
euen as Sainct Paule
ſayeth for conſience ſake and alſo
for Chriſtes ſake,Ephe. vi. who for vs
became lyke vnto men and was
founde in his apparel as a man
he h
                  •
               bled himſelfe and becamePhilip. ii.
obediente vnto the death, euen
the death of the croſſe, Let vs
therfore good contremen folowyng
the example of Chryſte
put from vs our wilfull diſobedience
wherein we haue obſtenatly
continued along tyme, by
the perſwacion of a rable of pernicious
heretikes, & heare what
Saincte Paule ſayeth.i. timo. iiii, In the
latter daies ſome ſhal goe from
the true faith of Chriſtes churchii. timo, iii
and ſhal geue hede to the ſpirite
of errour, and to the teachinge
of the deuil & his apoſtles, & in

another place he ſayth alſo, that
before the comminge of Antechriſtii. The. ii.
there ſhalbe a notable diſcentiō,
and departing from the
fayth of the catholycke churche,
through diſobedience, and is it
nor euen ſo now with vs: what
a notable dyſcencion, hathe bene
in this Churche of Englande,
what departinge from the true
fayth of the knowen churche of
God, what ſectes, what diuerſitie
of opinions is yet amonge
vs? For that we will not heare
the voice of god, nor our mother
the catholicke churche, but ſtyll
wyll runne after diuelyſh Prophetes
of that curſed or malingnaunt churche of Sathan, who
dyd pretende as it did apere vnto
the ſymple and vnlearned, aſpecial
fauour vnto gods word,
colourynge and payntyng their

hereſies, with the ſwete ſentenſes
of the Scripture peruerſly
vnderſtāded leading vs therby
to euerlaſting dampnacion.Iere. v, Let
vs therfore pray with the Prophet,
and ſaye: Lorde turne
thou vs to the, and then ſhal we
be turned. And vndoughteles
ſhalbe opened vnto vs, the abhominacion
of their falſe and curſed
preachinges who did repute
thē ſelues to be the church catholycke
condēpning al other good
& verteous men, that wer of the
vnyuerſal and knowen churche
of god, not to be of the church of
god, as did the Nouacions in
Rome, the Arryens in Grece, &
the donatiſtes in Affricke. And
now in our time the Luterians
and Swyngliās in England:The fa
                     •
                  le of the H
                     •
                  
                  retikes.
Further more if there were no
Scriptuures, as there are plentie,

to perſwade vs y• theſe oure
Luterians and Swinglians,
were not the true diſciples and
followers of Chriſt, yet the myraculus
diſtruction and fall of
them, wer a ſufficient proufe vnto
vs, that they wer not of god:
but the onelye diſciples of Sathan.
For in what eſtimacion
were they in this realme? How
were they exalted and had in honoure?
haue not their doctrine
bene receaued and followed? I
nede not much to ſpeake therof,
for it is not vnknowen to vs.
What ſtate they were in among
vs, and how malyciouſlye they
brought to pas, that the holye
ſacred temple, & houſe of prayer
(wherin god was of his faithful
people) honored and ſerued,
was ſo by thē defaced and diſguiſed,
that of that ſacred temple,

they made a Speluncke or
denne of Heretykes. Alſo if we
wolde not the inconſtancie that
was in them, & the variete of
order that was in their religiō,
it were a notable teſtimony alſo
that they wer not of god. To
ſpeake much of the end of them
I wil not, but onely of that execrable
man Cranmer, which
whē he vnderſtod that he ſholde
die, hūbled hym ſelfe to the Catholike
church, and ſhowed him
ſelfe to bee repentant, and ſory
for his ſedicious and euyll doctrine,
whiche he before hadde
taught & ſet forth in this church
of Englande. But what maner
of repentaūce it was that he thē
had and howe he humbled hym
ſelfe you ſhall here.ii. reg. xxi. In the .iii. of
the Kinges we reade yt Achab
when he heard the thonderinge

thretninges of god for his ydolatrye,
for a time repented and
humbled himſelfe, and it contynued
not longe: but that he did
fall to his olde accuſtomed ydolatrye
agayne, likewiſe Cranmer
as I haue ſaide repentid, &
humbled himſelfe to the Catholike
church, & ſhortly after with
Achab,Ioh. xvii returned to his ſhamefull
hereſies. Agayne Iudas alſo
repented that he had betraied
his maſter Chriſte, but the frutes
of repentance followed not
in him, and therfore Chriſt ſpeaking
of him ſaith: father al thoſe
which thou haſt geuen me haue
I kept and none of them is loſt
but the one childe of perdicion,
that the ſcrypture might be fulfylled,
Cranmer likewiſe repented
his hereſies, not ſimply and
vnfaynedly, but craftely & ſubtelly
vnder the cloke of ypocriſy

hauing a certain truſt therby to
auoid preſent death thē at hand
wherefore good contremen as
this wretched man haue choſen
parte with Iudas and Achab,
ſo doth his euill and miſerable
ende declare him to be a deteſtable
heretike and a diſobediente
member of Sathan, and foraſmuch
alſo as we by him haue
ben ſeduced and led into diuers
and ſondry errors, ſo is it moſte
neceſſary that we lyke obediēt
ſubiectes and faythfull Chriſtians
doe abhore and deteſt hys
h
                  •
               nouſe and vnſauery doctrine,
remembryng alwayes that as
by the diſobedience of the firſte
man Adam we were made the
children of wrath, ſo by the obedience
of the ſeconde Adā which
is Chryſt we are reconciled and
made the children of God, then
