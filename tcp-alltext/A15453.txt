                  imagine luſca, halfe-fac't, and of one ſide onely, to conceale the want of an eye, which hee had on the other. For if I ſhould ſet him out in the full proportion,

and leaue not ſo much as a wart, or a mole vndeſcribed, he would proue, but a foile, and a ſhadow, and not (as I deſire he ſhould) a liuely image, and repraeſentation to decke, and adorn theſe praeſent Funerals. His Vices can be no blemiſh to that King, that reſembled him onely in his choiſeſt Vertues. The Rule in Scripture doth differ much from that in the Painters ſhop. For here Coppies doe many times exceede the Originals. Salomon was a Type of Chriſt himſelfe, and by conſequence a Paterne for any Chriſtian. I doe therefore in theſe three Verſes obſerue three parts, the Happy Life, the Happy Raigne, and the Happy End of this great King Salomon. For the firſt part, his Life was happy in foure reſpects. Firſt, for his Sayings, The reſt of the Words. Secondly, for his Doings; And all that hee did. Thirdly, for his Wiſedome; And his Wiſedome. And fourthly, for the Eternitie, and preſeruation of all theſe, In a Booke of Annals of the Acts of Salomon; And the reſt of the words of
                  
                  Salomon, &c. For the ſecond part, his Raigne was Happy for three Circumſtances. Firſt for a great Capitall Citie, wherein hee reſided, which was Hieruſalem; Hee raigned in Hieruſalem. Secondly, for a great Circuit of Ground in which he commanded, which was, all Iſrael; ouer all Iſrael. Thirdly, and laſtly, for a great Space of time, wherein he flouriſhed, which was forty yeares; And the time which Salomon raigned in Ieruſalem ouer all Iſrael, was forty yeares. For the third part, his End was Happie in a threefold Circumſtance. Firſt, in regard of his death, which was not a ſudden, and violent dying, but an affected, and premeditated kinde of Sleeping; And Salomon ſlept. Secondly, in regard of his Soule at the time of his death, the which (Vid. Io. Monthol. i

no way deſpiſed, or neglected, but ſolemnely interred in the Sepulchers of the Kings, in the Tower of Sion, and the Citie of Dauid his Father; And Salomon ſlept with his Fathers, and was buried in the Citie of Dauid his Father.

Now if you deſire to know all that hee did, I muſt turne you ouer to this Booke of the Kings, which notwithſtanding is but a Florus to that Liuie, or rather a PHOTION to that DEMOSTHENES, that firſt deſcrib'd them.

                  HIS WISEDOME. For indeed braue Actions are but the Fruit, Wiſdome is the Tree that beares them. Actions are but Riuers, Wiſedome is the Head that feedes them. And where this is wanting, they are like Land-floods, violent for the time, but gone in an inſtant. Here therefore you haue the fruit together with the Tree, that brought them; here you ſee the Riuers, together with the Spring that ſent them; here you reade of Salomons Deeds ioyn'd with that Wiſedome that firſt contriu'd them. And the reſt of the words of Salomon, and all that Hee did, and his Wiſedome. HIS WISEDOME. How neceſſary in a King, Salomons choice hath taught all Kings. For being praeſented by God himſelfe with a Pandora of royall graces, although braue Actions call'd in

Nay, rather in taking out Wiſedome (as God tels him in the next verſe) hee left nothing behinde. Omnia aſſunt bona, quem penes eſt virtus. How can he want theſe golden Apples of Princely Actions, that hath this garden of the Heſperides, wherein they grow? For although Kings (as I ſaid before) be anointed on the Armes, the Inſtruments of Actions, yet are they crown'd onely on the Head, the ſ

And Salomon raigned in Hieruſalem ouer all Iſrael forty yeeres. And ſo much of the Second generall part of my Text, the moſt happy raigne of King Salomon.

Laſtly, as Men lay by their cloathes with an expectation to vſe them againe in the one: ſo doe the Saints their bodies, with an expectation of Iudgement in the other. So ends the Sermon of this Royall Preacher. God ſhall bring euery worke vnto iudgement, Eccleſ. 12. and the laſt verſ.

Nonotioſè ſcriptum eſt hoc, ſed perpenſè, & examinatè, ſaith Saint Ambroſe in his firſt Booke of Caine, and Abel. This is no phraſe light on by chance, but to be well weighed, and conſidered. It cannot be expounded of his dead Body; for none of the kindred were entombed with Salomon, but Dauid onely. Vnde claret, non ad Sepulturam corporis, ſed ad conſortium vitae relatum, as hee ſaith of Iſaac; and therefore, we muſt conclude, that Salomons ſleeping in this place, was not to rot with his Fathers in the graue, but to liue with them in the Kingdome of Heauen. And ſo Salomon ſlept with his Fathers. Idem eſt apponi ad populum ſuum, ac apponi ad Patres, ſaith Burgenſis. To ſleepe with his People, Gen. 25. 8. is the ſame thing as to ſleepe with his Fathers. And to ſleepe with his People is expounded by Sup. Geneſ. 26. 8. S. Auguſtin, to reſt in the ſociety of the Angels with Abraham,

                  Spartianus therefore reports of Traian, that after his Death, he triumphed openly in the Citie of Rome, In Imagine, in a Liuely Statue, or Repraeſentation inuented by Adrian for that purpoſe: Soe ſhall this Salomon of Iſrael doe at this time in the Statue, and Repraeſentation of our Brittiſh Salomon. Truly me thinkes (Si nunquam fallit imago) the reſemblance is very liuely.

               All the Circumſtances doe ſuit very well. And therefore, as a late

                  Commenter vpon Philoſtratus tells vs, that in Greece the Statuaries began with the making of their mould, and then proceeded to the poliſhing of their partes: Soe will I compare theſe two Kinges, firſt as it were in one generall lumpe, or mould, that you may ſee by the odneſſe of their

proportion, how they differ from all Kinges beſide: and then with a particular examination of the parts of my Text, that you may obſerue by the ſeuerall Members, how well they reſemble the one the other.
            
            
               FOr the bulke, or the mould, I dare praeſume to ſay, you neuer read in your liues, of two Kings more fully parallel'd amongſt themſelues, and better diſtinguiſhed from all other Kings beſides themſelues. King Salomon is ſaid to be Vnigenitus coram Matre ſua, the onely ſonne of his Mother, Prouerbs 4. 3. ſo was King Iames. Salomon was of complexion white, and ruddie, Canticles 5. 10. verſe. ſo was King Iames. Salomon was an infant King, Puer paruulus a little childe, 1 Chron. 22. 5. verſe. ſo was King Iames a King at the Age of thirteene moneths. Salomon began his raigne in the life of his Praedeceſſor, 1 Kings 1. 32. So, by the For his

                   force, and compulſion of that ſtate, did our

late Soueraigne King Iames. Salomon was twice crown'd, and anoynted a King, 1 Chron. 29. 22. So was King Iames. Salomons minority was rough through the quarrells of the former Soueraigne; So was that of King Iames. Salomon was learned aboue all the Princes of the Eaſt, 1 Kings 4. 30. So was King Iames aboue all Princes in the vniuerſall world. Salomon was a Writer in Proſe, and Verſe, 1 Kings 4. 32. So in a very pure and exquiſite manner was our ſweet Soueraigne King Iames. Salomon was the greateſt Patron we euer read of to Church, and Churchmen; and yet no greater (let the houſe of Aaron now confeſſe) then King Iames. Salomon was honoured with Embaſſadors from all the Kings of the Earth, 1 Kings 4. laſt verſe; and ſo you know, was King Iames. Solomon was a maine Improuer of his home commodities, as you may ſee in his Trading with Hiram, 1 Kings 5. 9. verſe; and, God knowes, it was the daily ſtudy of King Iames. Salomon was

a great maintainer of ſhipping, and Nauigation, 1 Kings 10. 14. A moſt proper Attribute to King Iames. Salomon beautified very much his Capitall Citie with Buildings, and Water-workes, 1 Kings 9. 15. So did King Iames. Euery man liu'd in peace vnder his vine, and his Figge-Tree in the daies of Salomon, 1 Kings 4. 25. And ſo they did in the bleſſed daies of King Iames. And yet towards his End, K. Salomon had ſecret Enemies, Razan, Hadad, and Ieroboam, and prepared for a Warre vpon his going to his Graue, as you may ſee in the verſe before my Text. So had, and ſo did King Iames. Laſtly, before any Hoſtile Act we reade of in the Hiſtory, King Salomon died in peace, when he had liued about 60. Yeares, as Lyra and Toſtatus are of opinion. And ſo you know did King Iames. You ſee therefore a Mould fitted for another Salomon in the Bulke, and Generall: I come now, according to the Method in my Text, to poliſh, and refine the Members of

this Statue in their diuiſion, and particular.
               
            
            
               TO beginne with his Reliquum verborum, his wordes, and Eloquence; you know it well enough, it was rare, and excellent in the higheſt Degree. Salomon ſpeaking of his owne Facultie in this kinde, diuides it into two ſeuerall Heads, a ready Inuention, and an eaſie diſcharge, and expreſsion of the ſame. God hath granted me to ſpeake, as I would, and to conceiue, as is meet, for the things ſpoken of, Wiſdome 7. 15. verſ. and this was eminent in our late Soueraigne. His Inuention was as quicke as his firſt thoughts, and his Wordes as ready as his Inuention. God had giuen him to conceiue. The Greeke word in that place is 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , that is, to make an Enthymem, or a ſhort ſyllogiſme; and that was his manner. He would firſt winde vp the whole Subſtance of his Diſcourſe into one ſolid, and maſſy conception; and then ſpread it, and dilate it to what compaſſe

he pleas'd, profluenti, & quae Principem deceret eloquentia (as Tacitus Annal. lib. 13. he ſaid of Auguſtus) in a flowing and a princely kinde of Elocution. Thoſe Speeches of his in the Parliament, Starre-Chamber, Councell Table, and other publique Audiencies of the State (of which, as of Tullies Orations, 
                     Plin. Secund. lib. 1. ep. 20. 
                  Ea ſemper optima quae maxima, the longeſt ſtill was held the beſt) doe proue him to bee the moſt powerfull Speaker, that euer ſwayed the Scepter of this Kingdome. In his Style you may obſerue the Eccleſiaſtes, in his Figures the Canticles, in his Sentences the Prouerbs, and in his whole Diſcourſe, Reliquum verborum Salomonis, all the reſt that was admirable in the Eloquence of Salomon. For, beſide his Proſe, Iter ad carmen nouerat, hee made a Verſe alſo when hee pleas'd, and that (as became Buchanans beſt Scoller) Saniſsimi coloris, of a moſt dainty, and elaborate compoſition. An euerlaſting honor to the Muſes.

For theſe Aberrations therefore in the Diſcipline of that Church (though hee honoured thoſe Preachers to his dying day for the truth of their Doctrine in all other points) hee firſt brought in Cambd. Eliz. pag. 362. the Iuriſdiction; Secondly, the Name; Thirdly, the Cathedrals; and laſtly, the Conſiſtories, and Reuenews of my Lords their Biſhops: ſuch a Patron hee was of this moſt reuerend, moſt auncient, and

moſt Apoſtolicall Diſcipline. Laſtly, he was as great a Patron of the Maintenance of the Church, as euer I read of in any Hiſtorie. For beſide his refuſall of Sede-vacantes, and that Law he enacted at his firſt entrance for the preſeruation of the Reuenew of our Churches in England, he might well ſay with Dauid for his other Kingdomes; Pſal. 68. 10. 
                  Zelus Domus tuae deuorauit me, that the Endowing of Biſhopricques, the Erecting of Colledges, the buying out of Impropriations, the Aſſigning of Glebes, the Repairing of the old, and the Founding of new Churches hath conſumed, and taken vp all, or the farre greater part of his Reuenews in Scotland, and Ireland. I haue no time to dwell vpon particulars, but in the generall, thinke you of whom you pleaſe, of Conſtantine of Rome, of Charlemaine of France, of Alphonſo of Spaine, or to come home to our owne Iſland, a Soile more fertill in prodigious Founders, of Lucius, of Offa, of Alfred, of Saint Edward, of any King before, or ſince

the Conqueſt, and I will ſay of my deare Maſter (as he ſaid of Traian) Tu melior peioriaeuo, though the times be farre worſe, yet was he farre the greater Founder. And therefore to conclude this point, imagine Diſcipline to be the Wals, Maintenance the roofe, and couer, true Doctrine the ſweet perfume, and Incenſe of the Temple, and you haue Salomons firſt Act before your eyes, the Building of Gods Houſe, and his Quid fecerit, what he did by Actions of Religion.
               
            
            
               FOr the Actions of Iuſtice in this King, they were ſo ordinary, that being repeated they would proue as taedious for the praeſent, as in the Ages to come they will be admired. For, as

If wee looke at home in his owne Dominions, neuer were the Benches ſo grauely furniſhed, neuer the Courts ſo willingly frequented, neuer poore, and rich ſo aequally righted, neuer the Ballance ſo euenly poized, as in the Raigne of our late Soueraigne. I could tell you that, that will neuer be beleeu'd in future times, of a Lord that died for a vile Varlet, of a Peere condemned for a ſorry Gentleman, nay of a deare Sonne vnrelieued for a time againſt a Stranger, for feare of ſwaruing the breadth of a haire from the line of Iuſtice. If wee looke abroad into forraign Countries, Quae tam ſepoſita eſt, quae gens tam barbara? Thoſe very Princes, that haue done him none, haue beene forc't to confeſſe his Vprightneſſe, and Iuſtice. I leaue you therefore to reſolue with your ſelues, of the which of theſe Salomons, that Text is moſt true; The Wiſedome of God was in Him, ad faciendum

can keepe it in order. And this is moſt euident in the Booke of God. When Iſrael is to be chaſtized with Warre, and Deſolation, any furious Iehu will ſerue the turne; But for the managing of a long, and a continued Peace, no leſſe is required then the Wiſedome of Salomon. Now of theſe Actions of King Iames his Peace, though many others haue made whole Bookes, yet will I make but a ſhort Index. You may finde in thoſe volumes, the Schooles of the Prophets newly adorned, all kinde of learning highly improued, manufactures at home daily inuented, Trading abroad exceedingly multiplied, the Borders of Scotland peaceably gouerned, the North of Ireland religiouſly planted, the Nauy Royall magnificently furniſhed, Virginia, New-found-land, and New-England peopled, the Eaſt India well traded, Perſia, China, and the Mogor viſited, laſtly, all the ports of Europe, Afrique, Aſia▪
                   and America to our red Croſſes freed, and opened. And they are all the Actions, and

true-borne Children of King IAMES his Peace. And ſo much, or rather (for want of time) ſo little of the Quae fecerit, and what he did; The reſt of the words of Salomon, and all that he did.

And it was his faſhion ſo to doe, when hee was ſummoned by any ſickneſſe. God dealt with this Bleſſed Prince, as he did with 4 Reg. 20. 6.

How powerfully did hee charge him with the care of Religion and Iuſtice, the two Pillars (as hee tearm'd them) of his future throne? How did he recommend vnto his loue, the Nobilitie, the Clergie, and the Communaltie in the generall? How did he thruſt, as it were into his inward boſome, his Biſhops, his Iudges, his neere Seruants; and that Diſciple of his whom he ſo loued in particular? And concluded with that heauenly Aduice, to his Sonne, concerning that great Act of his future marriage, To marrie

ſickneſſe more ſhaken with the fits of a raging Feuer, the neerer Death drew vnto him, the more he prepar'd himſelfe for it. All his Latter dayes hee ſpent in prayer, ſending his thoughts before into Heauen, to bee the Harbingers of his happy Soule. Some foure dayes before his end, he deſired to receiue the Bleſſed Sacrament, Viaticum Aeternitatis, as it is tearm'd in the Ancient Councels, a bleſſed Bait, that the deuout ſoule vſeth for the moſt part to take in this life, when it is ready to trauaile for the other life. Being demanded, if hee was prepared in point of Faith, and Charitie for ſo great a Deuotion; He ſaid hee was, and gaue humble thankes to God for the ſame. Being deſir'd to declare his Faith, and what he thought of thoſe Bookes he had written in that kinde, Hee repeated the Articles of the Creede one by one, and ſaid hee beleeued them all, as they were receiued and expounded by that part of the Catholique Church which was eſtabliſhed here in England. And ſaid with

a kinde of ſprightfulneſſe, and viuacitie, that what euer hee had written of this Faith in his life, he was now ready to ſeale with his Death. Being queſtioned in point of Charitie; He anſwered preſently, that hee forgaue all Men that offended him, and deſir'd to be forgiuen by all Chriſtians, whom hee in any wiſe had offended. Being told, that Men in Holy Orders in the Church of England doe challenge a power, as inhaerent in their Function, not in their Perſon, to pronounce and declare Remiſsion of ſins, to ſuch as being paenitent doe call for the ſame; And that they haue a forme of Abſolution for that very purpoſe, ſet down in the Booke of Common Prayers;

And after the Abſolution read, and pronounced, hee receiued the Sacrament with that Zeale, and Deuotion, as if hee had not beene a fraile Man, but a Cherubin cloathed with fleſh, and blood. And ſome houre after, he ſaid vnto his Sonne, the Duke, and others that ſtood about him, that they could not imagine what eaſe, and comfort he found in himſelfe,

From this time, to the houre of his death, the ſickneſſe preuailed more and more vpon his Body, and his Senſe, and Memory not much impaired, Prayers were multiplied accordingly from houre to houre, for the comfort of his Soule.

Shall I ſay therefore of my praeſent Maſter, that he is a great, and a hopefull King? All that is true; but I leaue it to another, that hath

time to enlarge it. I will onely ſay, as St. Orat. Funebr. de Morte Theodoſ. Imperat.
                   
                  Ambroſe ſaid of Theodoſius, Summam votorum complexus eſt, pius eſt; He hath ſhew'd himſelfe, as we deſir'd he ſhould, a pious Sonne of a moſt pious Father. He layes, with all poſſible ſolemnity, the Bodie of his Father in the Sepulchre of the Kings, erected by Henry the ſeuenth his great Grandfather, Tanquam in Ciuitate Dauid Patris eius; Iuſt as this other Salomon was, In the Citie of Dauid his Father. And yet, with due reuerence to his Maieſtie, I muſt be bold to ſay, that all this is nothing to that Honour, which God hath done to the Funeralls of his Father. So Pſal. 115. 15.

                  walk't on foot this day after the Hearſe, one of Myrons Statues, Qui paenè Hominū animas effinxerit, which came ſo neare to the Soules of Men, 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        : in Gregor. Theol. 
                  A breathing Statue of all his Vertues. This God hath done for Him, or rather for Vs. For as he hath made a liuely Repraeſentation of the Vertues of Salomon, in the Perſon of King Iames: So hath he done a like Repraeſentation of the Vertues of King Iames, in the Perſon of King Charles our Gratious Soueraigne.
               
               I will therefore conclude theſe Exequies of Salomon, with a ſaying ſpoken by that imitator of Salomon, 
                  Ecclūſ. 30. 4. 
                  Mortuus eſt Pater, & quaſi non eſt mortuus, Similem enim reliquit ſibi poſt ſe. Though his Father be dead, yet is he, as though hee were not dead, for he hath left One behinde him moſt like himſelfe. Whom God long proſper, and praeſerue.
