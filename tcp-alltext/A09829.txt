            ¶To the right worshipfull Mr. Edvvard Dyar Esquire, Iohn Frampton wisheth prosperous health and felicitie.
            
               HAVING lying by mee in my chamber (righte Worshipful) a translation of the great voiage & lōg trauels of Paulus Venetus the Venetian, manye Merchauntes, Pilots, and Marriners, and others of dyuers degrees, much bent to Discoueries, resorting to me vpon seuerall occasions, toke so great delight with the reading of my Booke, finding in the same such strange things, & such a world of varietie of matters, that I coulde neuer bee in quiet, for one or for an other, for the committing the same to printe in the Englishe tongue, perswading, that it mighte giue greate lighte to our Seamen, if euer this nation chaunced to find a passage out of the frozen Zone to the South Seas, and otherwise delight many home dwellers, furtherers of trauellers. But finding in my selfe small abilitie for the finishing of it, in suche perfection as the excellencie of the worke, and as this learned time did require, I stayed a long time, in hope some learned man woulde haue translat
                  •
               d the worke, but finding none that would take it in hand, to satisfie so many requests, nowe at last I determined to sette it forth, as I coulde, referring the learned in tongues, delighted in eloquence, to the worke it selfe, written in Latine, Spanish, and Italian, and the reste that haue but the English tong,

that seeke onelye for substaunce of matter to my playne translation, beseeching to take my trauell and good meaning in the beste parte. And bethinking my selfe of some speciall Gentleman, a louer of knowledge, to whome I mighte dedicate the same, I founde no man, that I know in that respecte more worthy of the same, than your worshippe, nor yet any man, to whome so many Schollers,

                many trauellers, and so manye men of valor, suppressed or hindred with pouertie, or distressed by lacke of friends in Courte, are so muche bounde as to you, and therefore to you I dedicate the same, not bicause you your selfe wāt the knowledge of tongues, for I know you to haue the Latine, the Italian, the French, and the Spanishe: But bycause of youre worthinesse, and for that I haue since my firste acquaintaunce founde my selfe without any greate deserte on my parte, more bound vnto you than to anye man in England, and therefore for your desert & token of a thankefull minde, I dedicate the same to youre worship, moste humbly praying you to take it in good parte, and to bee patrone of the same: and so wishing you continuaunce of vertue, with muche encrease of the same, I take my leaue, wishing you with many for the cōmon wealths sake, place with aucthoritie, where you maye haue daylye exercise of the giftes that the Lorde hathe endowed you withall in plentifull sorte.

               BIcause many be desirous of the knowledge of the partes of the worlde, what names they haue, and in what places they be, and that many and sundry times the holy scripture doth make mention, and also it is profitable for suche as doe traffique and trade to haue knowledge, I was moued to giue notice to all suche as are desirous or haue pleasure in reading.
            You shall vnderstande, that a man turning his face to the rising of the Sunne, that parte that is before hys eies where the Sunne doth rise, is called Orient or Easte, and his contrarie where the Sunne setteth, is Occident or Weast.

It hath these famous Cities and Prouinces. Ouer againste Iuberaltar, and the coaste of Mallaga is Mauritania, whiche we call Barbarie. It is named Barbaria, bycause the people be barbarous, not onely in language, but in manners and customes. Following towards the East is Numidia, Getulia, Tunes, a citie in Affrica, the name so giuen by Asu, to all Syria, and Aegipt. On the South parte be the Ethiopians, whiche hereafter shall be spoken of.

                  There is another Ethiopia called Asiatica interior, which the Arabians call Zenium, and these doe extende from the sayd hilles of the Moone,

All these Ethiopians bée Moores, and theyr laboure and occupation, is digging of golde out of the grounde, where they doe fynde great plentie. There is also another Ethiopia called Tragodytica, and thys dothe reache or extende from the foresayde Ethiopia, to the streyte or mouth of the redde Sea,The redde Sea. and these bée somewhat whyter, and the King and people bée Moores, and came out of Arabia foelix, for the Arabians came ouer the streyte of the redde Sea, and gotte that Countrey of the Iacobites by force, and at this daye there is robbing and stealing among them secretely, for the King of the Iacobites is of so greate power, that the Souldan of Babilon doth giue him tribute.Souldan.
               
            
            
               Arabia

That whyche is betwéene the redde Sea, and Sinus Perficus, is called the Iland of Arabia, and thys is called Arabia Foelix, by reason of the Incense that groweth there.Arabia Felix.
               
               There bée other two Arabias besyde thys, the one of them extendyng from the Mount Sinay, to the dead Sea, where the Children of Israell wente fortye yeares, and thys is called Arabia petrea, takyng that name of a Citie that is there. The other dothe extende betwéene Syria and Euphrates towardes the Citie of Lep

                  Alepo.
                  
which is as muche to say, as of Siria, and our Latines doe call it Arabia deserta. And wheras the vulgar people, and men for the most part, do thinke that Antilla, or those Ilandes lately found out by commaundemente of the Catholike King Don Fernando, and Lady Isabell Quéene, be in the Indias, they be deceyued therein, to call it by the name of the Indias. And for bycause that in Spaniola, or newe Spayne, they do find gold, some doe not let to say it is Tharsis, and Ophin, and Sethin, from whence in the time of Salomon,
                  Erronious iudgements of the voyages of Salomon.
                   they brought gold to Hierusalem. And thus augmenting erroures vpon erroures, let not to saye, that the Prophetes when they sayde that the name of oure Lorde God should be pronounced to people that haue not hearde of it, and in places and Countreys very farre off, and aparted, which is sayd to be vnderstanded by those that be called Indians, and by these Ilandes, and furthermore doe not let to say to this day, that it is to be vnderstanded by the places mentioned in the holy Scripture, and the Catholike doctors, and that this secret God hath kept hidden all this time, and by finding out these Ilands did reueale it. I séeing how they are deceyued in their vayne inuentions, and greate simplicitie, for zeale and good will of the truth, and to kill this canker, that it créepe no more nor ingender greater erroures, will giue light to this errour, answering to the said muttering talkers, according as to euery of them doth require.
               And first you shall vnderstande, that this name India, according to all Cosmographers, as well Christians as Infidels, of old time, and of later yeares, the name dothe come of a Riuer named Hynde, or Hyndo, that going towards the East, is the beginning of the Indias, whiche bée thrée in number,Three Indias, the first is the lower India. that is to say, the first is called the lower or nether India, the seconde is called the middle India, and the third is called the high or vpper India. The first or lower India is renamed Caysar, and these do extend towards

the East, from the Riuer India, vnto a Porte or Hauen on the Sea side, of great traffike and trade, called Cambaya. And the King of this India, and also the most part of the people be Moores, and the rest Idolaters. The second or middle India is surnamed Mynbar,

                     r, Colnugur, and héere be many Christians Heretikes Nestorians, and many Indians, although towards the North they be Idolaters. The thirde India, whiche is the hygh India, is surnamed Mahabar, and dothe extend vnto Cauch,
                  
                     The third India called the higher India.
                     An Oxe worshipped.
                   whiche is the Riuer Gange. Héere groweth plentye of Sinamon, and Pearle. The King and people of thys Countrey worship the Oxe. Besides these thrée Indias, whiche lye towardes the rising of the Sunne, there can not be found neyther Author nor Man that hathe trauelled the firme land, neyther the Seas adioyning there vnto, that can say, there is anye other Prouince or Ilande named India, sauing that if anye woulde giue to vnderstand, that going towarde the West, he wente towardes the East, and that although he came vnto the terrenall Paradise, and that these Ilands shoulde lye in the greate Weast Occean Seas, it appeareth playnely, for that those that sayle thither, steame their Shippe towards the Occident, and his direct wind whiche he sayleth withall, is out of the Orient or the East. So it appeareth, that they sayle not vnto the India, but that they flye and depart from the India. And thus it appeareth that he would say, that the firste name that euer it hadde, or was sette, naming it Antillya, seeming, that by the corruption of the vulgar, naming it Ante India, as to say against India, euen as Antechrist is contrary or against Christ, or Antenorth againste the North. And thus it appeareth, that it

can not be named India, but to vnderstande it as an antephrase, cleane contrary, as a Negro, or a blacke Moore shoulde be named white Iohn, or a Negresse or blacke woman, to be named a Pearle, or a Margarita, that for finding gold in the Iland named H
                        •
                     spaniola, it should haue the name set Tharsia, or Ophin, or Sethin, nor beléeue it standeth in Asia as some woulde saye, although the thyng is so cléere, that it séemeth a mockerie to proue it: but reason dothe leade, that wée shoulde gyue Mylke vnto Children and Infantes. Saincte Austine declareth, that the circumstance of the letter dothe illuminate the sentence. And it appeareth in the thyrde Booke of Kings, in the tenth Chapter, and the second of Paralipomenon, in the ninth Chapter, do saye, that the Seruantes of Salomon, and of Diran, doe fynde they broughte from Ophin and Sethin, and Tharsis, not onely golde, but also Siluer and Timber, called Thina, and Elephantes téeth, and Peacocks, and Apes, and Precious stones, the whyche thyngs in infinite places of the very true Indians, as well in Countreys farre within the lande, as also in Countreys vppon the Sea syde, and also in Ilandes wythout number, that bée in the Oriente or East Seas, shall be founde, as by experience of the Merchantes traffiking into the East, conforming to the holy Scripture, and to all those that doe write, as well Catholikes, as Prophanes, is manyfest. And in the Ilande called Spaniola, there can bée found no suche Timber, nor all the other thyngs before named, sauyng Golde, the whiche as by this worke wyll appeare, is founde in a greate number of places of the Orientall partes. What is hée that in bringing gold from Antilla, will proue it is from Ophin, or Sethin, or Tharsis, from whence it was brought to Salomon. First hée must prooue that it was neuer founde but in one place, and that at thys daye it is not to bée had, but in

the same place only, from whence it was broughte to Salomon, the which is a manifest vntruth or false. And also they that vnderstande that the storie of the holy scripture, and the holy prophets, when they do now name countries from whence those things be brought, and farre Ilandes of Idolatours, wheeeas the name of God was not h
                     •
                  ard, did not speak but of Spaniola, and of the other West parts, he must proue there is no other Idolatours in the worlde but those whom he falsely calleth Indians, nor other Ilāds but the Spaniola, and the other West Ilandes, and thys is of a truth, all false, for Grecia is Ilandes, Scicilia, a noble Ilande, and Malta, and Lipari, Yzcla, Serdenya, Corsica, Mallorca, Minorca, Ybisa, Canarias, England, and others infinite in the foure partes of the world, before now hath bin founde Of the whiche in the Orient or east, is Taprobano, which is the most noble Iland in the world, and the Ile which is sayde to be so happie and fortunate, that of neuer trée there falleth a leafe of in the whole yeare, as also by thys Booke of Marcus Paulus is to be séene in the 106. Chapter, of one Ilande that is in the Orientall seas .1500. myles, in the which there is found gold in so great abundaunce, that it is sayde the Kinges Pallace is couered or tyied wyth gold.
               And furthermore, it is sayd, that the fame is, that in those seas be seauen thousand four hundred fortie eight Ilandes, in the whiche there is not founde one trée, but that is swéete, pleasaunt, and fruiteful, and of great profit, wherby we may wel conclud, that in many other Ilands, there is gold to be found: therfore it is not necessarie, that the holye Scriptures shoulde be so vnderstanded by Antilla, when it is sayde, they went for gold to Tharsis, & Ophyn, and Sechyn, yea and although they wyll not beléeue the 
                     •
                  
                  ther truthes, they can not denye the saying of the holye Scripture in the Seconde Chapter of Genesis, where

it is sayde that the first riuer that goeth out of Paradise is 
                     
                        •
                     hyson, which doth compasse the whole countrey of Eiulath, where golde doth growe, and that the golde of that countrey is very good and pure, nor it was not néedefull to haue thrée yeres from Ierusalem to Antilla, as it is for the Ilands of the Indians, whiche is more further off, by a great deale, and with much more difficultnesse to prouyde the precious stones, and all other things they brought frō thence, and also the wayes be more difficulte and strange, by reason of contrarye windes, and manye other incumbraunces. And that this was not vnderstanded that the people a farre of are these Ilandes now founde, it appeareth by Saint Paule in the fiftéenth Chapter to the Romaynes, where is expounded the saying of Esay in the 52. Chapter, wher it is sayde, That those to whom it was not pronounced vnto, shoulde sée, and those that did not heare of him, should vnderstande. And this, as a lyttle aboue is sayde, is vnderstanded, that from Ierusalem to the Iles of Grecia, to the sea Illyrico which is the end of Grecia, and the beginning of Italy, by Slauonia, or Dalmatia, and Venice, where before they had not hearde the name of Christ declared. And bycause the holye ghost hath interpreted thys sentence by Saint Paul, applying that prophecie with other like of his workes, there remayneth no licence for other to apply it to Antilla.
               
               But now let vs come to the summe of this reckning, and say, that if for the golde that is founde in Antilla, wée should beléeue that it is Tharsis, and Ophyn, and Sethyn, by ye other things that be founde in Ophyn, &c, and not in Antilla, we must beléeue that it is not those, nor those it. And moreouer, it appeareth that Asia and Tharsis, Ophyn, and Sethyn, be in the East, and Antilla the Spanyola in the west, in place and condition much different.

            The Prologue.
            
               TO all Princes, Lordes, Knightes, and all other persons that this my Booke shall sée, heare, or reade, health, prosperitie, and pleasure. In thys Booke I do mind to giue knowledge of strange and maruellous things of the world, and specially of the partes of Armenia, Persia, India, Tartaria, and of many other prouinces and Countreys, whiche shall be declared in this worke, as they were séene by me Marcus Paulus, of the noble Citie of Venice: and that which I saw not, I declare by report of those that were wise, discrete, and of good credite, but that which I saw, I declare as I saw it, and that which I knew by others, I declare as I heard it. And for that this whole worke shall be faithfull and true, my intente is not to write any thing, but that which is very certaine. I do giue you all to vnderstande, that sithence the birth of our Sauioure and Lorde Iesus Christ, there hathe bin no man, Christian, nor Heathen, that hathe come to the knowledge and sight of so manye diuers, maruellous, and strange things, as I haue séene and hearde, whiche I will take in hande the laboure to write, as I did sée and heare it. For me thinke I shoulde do a great iniurie to the world, in not manifesting or declaring the truth. And for better information to them that shall reade or heare this worke, I do giue you to vnderstand, that I trauelled in the foresayd Prouinces and Countreys, and did sée those things that I will declare, ye space of sixe and twentie yeares, & caused thē to be written to Mayster Vstacheo of Pisa, the yeare of our Lorde God .1298. He and I then being prisoners in Ianua,

went to Constantinople with their Merchandises. And béeyng there a certayne tyme, wyth councell of theyr friendes, passed wyth such wares and iewels as they had boughte in the Countrey of the Souldan, where they were a long time, determining to goe forwarde, and trauelling a long iourney, came to a Citie of the Lorde of the Tartarians, which is called Barcacan, who was Lord of a greate parte of Tartaria,

And bycause of these warres, my father and vncle coulde not returne the way they went, but determined to go forwarde to the Eastward, and so to haue returned to Constantinople, and following their way, came to a Citie in the East partes, called Buccata, whiche is within the precinct of the East Kingdome. And departing from this Citie, passed the Riuer which is called Tygris, whiche is one of the foure that commeth out of Paradise terrenall, and goyng seauentéene dayes iourneys through a Deserte, not finding any

In thys Countrey, were these two bréethren

This Alan is otherwise called the greate Cane. Thys Embassadoure maruelled muche to sée these two Bréethren béeyng Christians, and tooke greate pleasure at them, bycause they hadde neuer before that tyme séene any Christians, and sayde to them, Friends, if you wyll followe or take my councell, I will shewe you wayes or meanes whereby you shall gette greate riches and renowme.

The great Cane vnderstandyng theyr answeres, had grat pleasure therein, and speaking to his Lords, saying, that hée woulde sende an Embassadour to the Pope, the head Bishop of the Christians, and requested the said two bréethren, that it woulde please them to be his Embassadors to the Pope, with one of his Lordes: they aunswered, they were readie to doe all that he woulde commaund them. Streight way the great Cane caused to bée written Letters of beliefe in the Tartarian tong to the Pope, and also commaunded by worde of mouth to hys sayd Embassadors, that they shoulde saye, and desire hys holynesse, that it would please him to send him a hundred men, discrete, wise, and learned Christians in the Catholike faith, to instruct him and his Subiects, whereas then they did all worship Idols, and would gladly receyue the true faith. And also, the great Cane requested them to bring him some of the Oyle that did burne before the Sepulchre of Iesus Christe in Ierusalem. This done, the great Cane commaunded to be broughte to him a Table of gold, and wrote in it, commaunding expresly to all hys subiects that shoulde sée that his Table, that they shoulde receyue those Embassadors with all frendshippe, and to shew them honour and obedience, and to do al things that shoulde be necessarie, and to deliuer them money, and to prouide them what they woulde demaunde, as well for shipping, as also Horses, or any other thing, in as ample maner, as if it were for his owne person. When the sayd Nicholas and Mapheo, and Cocoball, Embassador to the great Cane, were at a poynt to depart, taking their leaue of ye great Cane, they rode with their cōpany thirtie days iourney, and at the ende of them, the saide Cocoball fell

sicke and dyed, and the two bréethren followed on theyr iourney, and in euery Towne where they came shewing the foresayd Table of gold, where very honourably receyued and enterteyned, as the person of the King. And continuing their iourney, they came to a towne called Giaza, and from thence departed, and came to Acre in the moneth of Aprill,

These two bréethren remayned in Venice the space of two yeares, tarying the creation of a newe Pope, and séeyng howe long they had taryed, departed from Venice to Ierusalem, for to gette some of the Oyle that burned in the Lampe before the holy Sepul

their Embassage to the Pope, and that he should prouide that which should be conuenient, and so departed the two bréethren, and Marcus, and trauelled till they came to a Towne called Giaza. And in this time the Legate receyued Letters from Rome, that there was a new Pope created, called Gregorie of Placentia. The sayd Legate incontinent sent his messenger after these two bréethren, that they should returne to Acre, certifying thē, yt there was a new Pope created: and they vnderstanding this, requested the King of Armenia to commaunde to arme forthe a Galley, wherein they sayled incontinente to the Pope, of whome they were well receyued, who hauyng hearde their Embassage, streighte way gaue them two Friers, of the order of Sainct Dominike, being greate Clearkes, to go with them to the greate Cane, the one of them was called Frier Nicholas of Venice, and the other Frier William of Tripolle, the whiche were well séene and exercised in disputations in the defense of the holy Catholike faith. And these two religious men with Nicholas and Mapheo, and Marcus, trauelled, till they came to a Towne called Giaza. And in this time the Souldan of Babylon came into Armenia, and did there greate hurte, and for that cause, fearing to passe anye further, the two Friers taryed there, and wrote to the greate Cane, that they were come thyther, and the cause wherefore, they wente not forwarde.

at their comming receyued them with gret pleasure, anthey knéelyng down, making great reuerence, he commaūdded them to arise vp, demaūding of them how they spedde in their voyage, and what they had done with the Pope, and after they had made their answeare to al things, deliuered to him the Friers letters that remayned in Giaza, and the oyle they had taken out of the Lampe that burned before the holy Sepulchre of Iesus Christe, whiche he receyued with great pleasure, and put it vp, and kept it in a secrete place, with also the letters, and demaunding of them, who Marcus was, they aunswered, he was Nicholas sonne, of the which the great Cane was glad, and toke him into his seruice, and gaue order to place him in his Court among his Lordes and Gentlemen.

And this Countrey is subiect to the Tartar, & there is in it many Cities & Townes, and the most noble Citie is called Archinia, which hath ioyning to it two prouinces, the one called Archeten, the other Arzire. In this Citie is a Bishop. The people of this Countrey in ye sommer time bée in the pastures & meddowes, but in ye winter they can not, by reason of ye great cold, snow, & waters, for then it is so colde, ye scant the cattell and beastes can liue there,Heere on a high Mounta

In this part towards the Georgians there is a well, the water wherof is like oyle, and is of great abundance & quantitie, that sometimes they lade .100. Ships with it. And this oyle is not good to eate, but for Lamps and Candles, and to annoint Camels, Horses, and other beastes that be galled, scabbie, and haue other infirmities, and for this cause it is fetched into diuers places.

                  IN Georgiania is a king called Nand Maliche, which is as much to say as Dawnid, and is subiect to the Tartar. The saying is that in the olde time, the Kings of that Prouince were borne with a token or signe vnder their right shoulder. In this Countrey ye men be faire of body, venterous & valiant in armes, and good archers, and are Christians & Gréekes mingled togither, & they go all with their heare like Priestes.

of golde, siluer, and pretious stones.

And perceyuing the Calipho knewe not how to make him an answere, said vnto him, bycause thou louest this treasure so well, I will thou shalte haue thy fill of it, and caused him to be shut fast in the same Tower, where he liued foure dayes, and died miserably for hunger, and from that time forwards the Moores woulde haue no more Caliphos in that Citie.

               Of a great miracle that hapned in Mosull. CHAP. 12.
               
                  IN Mosull, a Citie in the Prouince of Baldach was a Calipho, a great enimie of the Christians, whose studie daye and night was how he might destroy them, and to make them forsake their faith in Iesus Christ, and vpon this, ioyned in councell diuers times with hys wise men, and in the ende one of them said, I will tell you a way how you shal haue good cause to kill, or force them to renounce their Faith. Iesus Christ sayth in hys Gospell, If you haue so much Faith as the grayne of Mustard seede, and saye to thys Mountayne passe from this place to another place, it woulde do, therefore cause to be called togither all the Christians, and commaund them by their beléefe, that such a hill doe passe from that place to suche a place: truly it is not possible for them to doe it, and not doing it, you may iustly saye to them, that eyther theyr Gospell dothe not saye truth, and by that meanes they follow lyes, or else they haue not so much Fayth as a grayne of Mustarde séede. And thus as well for the one, as for the other, you maye iustly putte them to death, or else force them to forsake theyr Fayth they holde. This councell pleased well the Calipho, and those of hys sect, beléeuing, that nowe they hadde good occasion to performe their euill purpose, and incontinent he commaunded all the Chrystians that were in hys Countrey, to come togither, whiche was a great number, and they being come before hym, he cause thē to reade those Scriptures of Iesus Christ. And after that euery one of them had hearde it, he asked them if they beléeued that these sayings were true, and they answered yea. Incōtinent said the Calipho to them, I wil giue you fiftéene days respite, to make either yōder hil to passe to such a place, or else to

renounce youre fayth in Iesus Christe as false, and to turne Moores, and if you will not doe this, you shall all die. And the Christians hearing this cruell sentence, were sore troubled, yet on the other part they comforted themselues, with hope in the faith they had in the truth they beléeued. And incontinent the Bishops, and Prelates, and Ministers that were among the Christians, commaunded all the Christians, men, women, and children, to fall to continuall Prayer to oure Lorde Iesus Christ, that he would helpe and councell them howe to rule and gouerne themselues in that greate trouble and néede.
               And after eyght dayes were past, appeared an Angell to a holy Bishop, and commaunded him that he should say vnto a Shomaker that was a Christian, that had but one onely eye, that he should make Prayers to God, the which for his fayth and Prayers, shoulde make that hill remoue from his place, into the place the Calipho had appoynted. And incontinente the Bishop sente for that Shomaker, and with great desire prayed him to make Prayers to oure Lord God, that for hys m

                  rcie and pitie he woulde remoue that hill as the Calipho and M

                  ll vnderstande, that thys Shomaker dyd pull out his eye by this meanes: He hadde hearde manye tim

                  s this saying in the Gospell, If thy eye offende thee pull it out, and cast it from thee. He being a simple man, thought, that so corporally and m

                  terially the Scriptures shoulde be vn
                     •
                  erstanded. For it chanced on a time, there came a M
                     •
                  yde into his Shoppe to bespeake a payre of Shoes, and to take the measure of his foote, put off hir hose, and he withall was tempted to lye with hir, remembring himselfe, and

                  
                     •
                  hinking vpon his sinne and yll intent, sent hir away, without discouering any thing of his yll thoughte and intente, and remembring the saying of the holy Gospell, being ouercome with zeale, and yet not hauing the true knowledge, plucked out his eye. And so this Shomaker being so desired by the Bishop, and other Christians, did graunt, and promised to praye vnto our Lord God for the sayd cause. And the time of the .xv. dayes being come, that the Calipho had appoynted, he caused to come togither all the Christians, whiche came in Procession with their Crosse, into a faire playne, hard by the hill and Mountayne. And to that place came the Calipho, with muche people armed, with intention, that streight way, if the Mountayne did not remoue, to kill them all. Incontinente the Shomaker knéeled downe vppon the earth vpon his bare knées, and very deuoutely prayed to oure Lorde, lifting vp his hearte and handes to Heauen, praying to Iesus Christe to succour and helpe them his Christians, that they shoulde not perishe: and for that his faith was cléere, makyng an end of his Prayer, the power of the Almightie God Iesus did cause the Mountayne to remoue and goe from the place it stoode,
                     A great miracle.
                     A Mountain remoued frō one place to another.
                     The Calipho became christned, and a great nūber of his Moores
                   into the place the Calipho and his Councell hadde commaunded.
               And the Moores séeyng thys greate and manyfest miracle, stoode wonderfully amazed, saying, Great is the God of the Christians, and the Calipho, with a great number of the same Moores became Christned. And after this Calipho dyed, the Moores that were not Christned, would not consente that this Calipho should be buried, wheras the other Caliphoes were buried, for bycause that after that myracle, he lyued and dyed like a true and faythfull Christian.

                     PErsia is a noble Prouince or Countrey, although it was much more in the old time, than it is at this present, for it was destroyed by the Tartars. In Persia is a Citie called Sabba, from the which the saying is, the thrée Kings departed,In this Citie Sabba the three Kings met that wēt to worship Christ, and heere they were buried. that went to Iesus Christ, that was newly borne in Bethleem. In this citie there are Sepulchres, very faire and beautifull, and I Marcus Paulus was in that Citie, and asked of the people of that Countrey what they could say or knewe of the thrée Kings, to the which they could say nothing, but that they were buried in those thrée Sepulchres. But ye other people out of the Citie thrée dayes iourney, talked of this matter in thys maner following, for the which you shal vnderstād, that thrée days iourney frō the Citie Sabba is a Towne, which is called Calassa Tapeziston, which in our language is as much as to say the Towne of them that worship the fire for their God. And these people say, that whē the thrée Kings departed frō ye prouince, for to go to the land of the Iewes, which was Bethleem, to worship the great Prophet there newly borne, they carried with thē Golde,The three Kings offered Gold, Incense, and Myrre. Incense, and Myrre, and when they came to Bethleem in Iudea, found a child lately borne, and did worshippe him for God, and presented to him the foresaide thrée things: and that the said child did giue thē a little Boxe, closed, or shut fast, commanding thē they should not open it. But they, after they had trauelled a long iourney, it came in their mindes to sée what they carried in the said Boxe, and opened it, and foūd nothing in it but only a stone: and they taking it in ill parte, that they sawe nothing else, did cast it into a well, and by and by descended fire from Heauen, and burnt all the Well wyth the stone.A miracle if it be true. And the Kings séeing this, each of them toke of the

same fire, and carried it into their Countreys: and for thys cause they do worship the fire as God. And when it chanceth in any place in that Countrey that they lacke fire, they goe to séeke it in another place where they cā get of it, and so do light their Lampes. And sometimes they goe and séeke it eyght or tenne dayes iourney, and not finding of it, they goe ofttymes to the Well aforesayd, to haue of the same fire. Of all this before written, you shall take yt which doth agrée with the holy Gospell, in saying the thrée Kings went to worship our Lord Iesu, and did offer those giftes aforesaide. All that is declared besides that, be erroures, and reacheth not to the truth, but augmēted with lyes vpon lyes, as the vulgar people without knowledge are accustomed to do.

                     IAsoy is a goodly Citie and bigge, full of Merchants.Heere they do make gret plentie of cloth of golde and silke. There they do make great abundance of cloth of gold, and silke. They be called accordyng to the Citie Iasoy. The people of this Countrey be of the sect of Martin Pinol, that is, Mahomet, and do speake another language than the Persians. And going forward eyght dayes iourney from this Citie, through a playne Countrey, but not peopled, or anye Towne, sauing Mountaynes, where is great plentie of Partriches, and wild Asses, at the ende of this, is the Kingdome of the Crerina, that is, a Kingdome of the Persians, of a great and long inheritance.
               In this Countrey they doe finde greate plentie of pretious stones,Pretious stones, as Turkises and others. and of Turkies great store in the Mountaynes, in the whiche Mountaynes, is greate plentie of Vayne, or Ore of Stéele, and of Calamita. In this Citie, they do make greate plentie of costly saddles, bridles, and harnesses for Horses, and for noble men Swords,
                     Sadles and bridles, and other costly furniture for Horses.
                     Cloth of gold and silke.
                     Excellent good hawkes.
                   bowes, and other riche furniture for Horse and Man. The Women of this Countrey doe nothing, but commaunde their Seruauntes. They make also there very riche cloth of gold and silke. And in those Mountaynes be excéeding good Hawkes, valiaunte, and swifte of wings, that no fewle can scape them. And departing from Crerina, you shall goe eyght dayes iourney in playne way, full of Cities and Townes, very faire, and there is pleasaunte Hawking by the way, & great plentie of Partriches. And being past the sayd eyght dayes iourney, there is a going downe

the hil of two dayes iourney, whereas there is great plenty of frutes. In the olde time there was manye Townes and houses, and now there be none but heardmen, that kéepe the Cattell in the field. From the Citie of Crerina, so this going down, al the winter is so great cold, that although they go very wel clothed, they haue ynough to do to liue. And being past this going downe two dayes iourney forwarde, you shall come into a faire playne way, the beginning whereof is a great faire Citie, called Camath, the whiche was in the old time noble and greate, and nowe is not so, for that the Tartars haue destroyed it. That playne is very hote, and that Prouince is called Reobarle. There be apples of Paradise, and Festucas, and Medlars, and diuers other goodly frutes in great abundance. There be Oxen maruellous great, the heare short and soft, and the hornes short, bigge, and sharp, and haue a greate rounde bunche betwéene the shoulders, of two spannes long. And when they will lade these Oxen, they do knéele downe on theyr knées like Camels, and being ladē, do rise, and they carrie great weight. There the Shéepe be as greate as Asses, hauing a greate tayle, and thicke, that will weigh .32. pound,Sheepe as great as asses. and be maruellous good to eate. In that playne be many Cities & townes with walles, and Towers of a great heigth for the defence of the enimies, called Caraones, which be certaine Villages. The people of that Countrey their Mothers be Indians, and their fathers Tartars. When that people will go a robbing, they worke by enchantment by the Deuill,Enchantmēt. to darken the aire, as it were midnight, bycause they woulde not bée séene a farre off, and this darkenesse endureth seauen dayes. And the Théeues that know well all the wayes, goe togither, withoute making anye noyse, and as many as they can take, they robbe. The olde men they kill, and the yong men they sell for slaues. Their King is called Hegodar, and of a truth I Marcus Paulus do tell you, that I escaped very hardly from taking of these 
                     〈◊〉

                  tayne, called Detustlyno, that is eightéene miles long & more, and is also very daungerous with théeues, that do rob Merchauntes and all trauellers. At the ende of this mountaine is a faire playne, called the goodly playne, which is seauen dayes iourney, in the which there be many wels, and date trées, very good, and this playne bordereth vpon the Ocean Sea, and on the riuer of the sea, is a Citie called Carmoe.

In this Citie they do drinke wine made of Dates, putting good spices to it, yet at the beginning of dinner it is daungerous, for those that be not vsed to it, for it will make them very soluble, streight waye, but it is good to purge the body. The people of that Countrey do not vse of our victuals, for when they eate bread of wheate and fleshe, by and by they fall sicke. Their victuals is Dates & salte, Tonny, Garlike & Onyons. The peopl

There be many riuers and Wels, that euery one hath faire water for his garden: and there be manye that dwell in a desart, wheras is al sande, that ioyneth to that playne. And those people assoone as they féele the great heate, they goe into the waters, and there tarrie till the beate of the daye be past. In that countrey, they do sowe their wheate and corne in Nouember, and gather it in Marche. And in thys time the fruites be greater than in any place.

And it was builded in such sorte, that one Piller of Marble standing in the middest, did beare vp all the roufe of the Church, and the Christians did put vnder the sayde piller a goodly Marble stone, whiche was the Moores, and for bycause the king was a Christian, they durst say nothing of it. This king died, and one of his sons succéeded him in the kingdome, which was no Christian, and on a time the Moores demaunded their stone of ye Christians, thinking that in taking away that stone, the whole roufe of the Church would fal downe: and the Christians did offer to pay the Moores for the stone, what they woulde demaunde: but they woulde not by anye meanes, but haue their stone, and in the ende, the new king commaunded the Christians to restore the stone to the Moores, and the time appointed being come, that the Moores would haue it, the sayde Piller lifted it selfe vp, thrée spannes aboue the stone, and so hāged in the ayre, that the Moores might take away their stone, and yet the Church fell not, and so doth th

               Of the prouince of Tanguith, and of the Citie Sangechian, and of many straunge things there. CHAP. 37.
               
                  AFter you be passe the sayde thirtie dayes iourney by the deserte, you shall come to a Citie called Sangechian, subiect to the greate Cane. And this prouince is called Tanguith, in the whiche al be Idolaters, sauing some be Christians, Nestorians, and some Mahomets. The Idolaters speake the Persian tong, and doe liue by the fruites of that Countrey. There be among them manye Monasteries of the Idolaters, wher with great deuotion they bring their children, and with euerie of them a shéepe, and do present to their Idols: and euerie yeare they come with theyr children and make great reuerence to their Idols, & bryng with them their shéepe, and kill them, and séeth them, and present them there, before their Idols, saying to them, they must eate their meate, the which they can not doe, for they haue neyther mouth nor sense, and séeing their Idols do

                   not eate it, they carrie it home to their houses with greate reuerence, and call theyr kyndered togyther, and do eate

of it, as meate sacrificed to their Gods, and put the bones in a basket. When anye man or woman dieth, they burne the body: and this they accustome to doe with al the Idolators. And in the way that the deade bodies shall passe to be burnte,A rich mouening & good cheare. stande all their friendes and kinsfolkes to accompany the body to the sepulchre, all clothed in cloth of golde and silke: and after the burnte bodye is put into the grounde, they cause to be brought thither meate & drinke, and there they do eate and drinke with greate myrth, saying: These bodies shall be receiued in the other worlde with like honour. When they burne the bodies, they do also burne with them diuers papers paynted, of men, women, and beastes, say
                     •
                  ng, that as many pictures of men, women, and beastes, as they do burne with them, so many seruaunts they shall haue in the other world to doe them seruice: and when they cary them to bury, there goeth before them diuers kinds of instruments playing. And whē one of these Idolators dieth, his friendes incontinentlye declare to the Astrologers, the day and the houre hée was borne in, and wil not bury him before the day & houre the Astrologers doe commaunde: by that meanes some they bury straightways, and somtimes, they tarry ten, twenty, and thirtie dayes, and sometime sixe moneths, according as the Astrologers doe commaunde: and in the meane time, they do sire the body with spices, and put it in a coffin, and nayle it faste, and lay a cloth ouer it, and euerye day they set their table ouer the Coffin, and there do eate and drinke, and pray the dead body to eate with them. And when the day appointed is come for to bury him, the Astrologers do say, that if he hath layne there one month, it is not good to take him oute of that place, by the iudgement of the Constellations, and for that cause muste first remoue him to some other side of the house, & from thence carry him to bury.

                     CHamul is a prouince in the whiche be manye Citties and Townes, whereof the chiefest is called Chamul, and this prouince is towards the winde called Maistral, which is Northeast, and hath two Deserts: on the one side, the Deserte is of thrée dayes iorney, and on the other side as muche. The people of this Countrey worship Idols, and doe speake the Persian tongue. They liue by their labor in the Countrey, and haue plentie of al things néedefull. They be people giuen much to their owne pleasure, as playing on instrumentes, dauncing, and singing. And if any straunger doe goe to sée their pastime, they receiue him, and make very much of him, with feasting and cheare, and the goodman commaundeth his wife to make hym the beste cheare she can, and to obey him in al things he will commaunde or desire, and so the goodman goeth to his laboure into the fieldes, and leaueth the straunger with hys wife, willing hir to obey hym as to his owne person: and this custome the menne and the women vse there, & be not ashamed therof. The women be very faire there. In the time of the greate Cane that is passe, for the greate dishonestie hée heard of the people of that countrie, and the greate hurte they susteined in their houses, commaunded them that they shoulde receiue no straungers into their houses, wherewithall the people were

sore offended, and thinking themselues not well vsed, sent Embassadors to the greate Cane, requesting him, that he woulde not restraine them from their auntient liberties and customes, that their anticessors hadde euer vsed, and they for their partes woulde continue the same, otherwise they shoulde be vnthankefull to their Idolls. After the greate Cane hadde hearde their Embassage, aunswered them, séeyng they had pleasure in suche shamefull vsages, and woulde not leaue it, he also was contented with it.
            
            
               Of the prouince Hingnitala, and of the Salamandra that is founde there. CHAP. 39.
               
                  
                     HIngnitala is a prouince set betwéen the North and the Easte, and is a long prouince of sixetéene dayes iourney, and is subiect to the great Cane, and there is manye Cities and Townes. There is also in that prouince, thrée linages of people, to saye, Idolators that be Christians, Nestorians and Iacobites, and the other Mahomets. At the ende of this prouince towardes the North is a greate hill, on the whiche there is neither beastes nor Serpent, and from thence they doe gather that whiche is called Salamandra, which is a thréede they doe make cloth of. They gather it after this manner, they digge a certaine vayne that they doe there finde, and afterwardes they beate it in a

morter of a lofer, and afterwarde washe it, and there remaineth small fine théedes faire and cleane, and after they haue caste out that which they doe washe it withall, they spinne it, and weaue it, and make table clothes and napkins of it, then they caste them into the fire for a certaine time, whereas it waxeth as white as snowe: and the great Cane once in thrée yeres doth send for some of them that be made of Salamandra. And they wer wont for to sēd of these napkins, for to hang before the vernacle of oure Lorde Iesus Christ, whome the people of Leuant do take for a great prophet. Departing from this prouince, and going betwéen the Northeast and East, you shal trauaile tenne dayes iourney and come to little habitation, and at the end of the tenne dayes iourny, you shall find a prouince called Sanchur, in it be Christians and Idolators, subiects to the great Cane. The two prouinces beforesaide, to say, Chamul, and Hingnitala be called Tanguth, with the prouince of Sachar. In all the hilles of this prouince is found greate plentie of Rewbarbe, and there the Merchauntes do buy it, and carry it to all places to sel. There they doe not vse any occupation, but the moste parte doe liue by the laboure of the Countrey.

                     CAmpion is a greate Citie and fayre, & is the heade of the prouince of Tanguth. In this Citie be thrée sortes of people, that is to say, Christians, Idolators, and Mahomets. The Christiās haue thrée great Churches and faire, and the Idolators haue also Monasteries

Abbeys, and religious houses, more chaste and comly than the other, and they do kil no beast nor fowle there till the fifth day of the Moone, and in those fiue days they liue more honest, deuout, and chast, than in any other time of the yeare. These Idolators may haue thirtie wiues apéece, or more, if they be able to maintaine them, but the firste wife is chiefe, and if anye of them doe not contente him, he may put hir away. They do mary in kinreds, and liue like beastes. In this Citie was Mapheo Nicholas and Marcus Paulus seauen yeres, vsing the trade of merchaundize.
            
            
               Of a Citie called Eusina, and of many notable things in Tartaria. CHAP. xlj.
               
                  DEparting from the foresayde Cittie Campion, and trauailing twelue dayes iorney, you shall come to a Citie called Eusina, the whyche is in a fielde of the Desert called Sabon, toward the North, and is of the prouince Targuth. In this Citie they bée al Idolators, and haue great abundaunce of Camels and other cattell withall: they gette their liuing by labouring the ground. In this Citie those that do trauaile, do prouide them of victualles, and other necessaries, for fortie dayes iourney, whyche they must passe through a great. Desert, wheras be no towns nor houses, nor grasse, but in the mountaines about dwel people, and also in the valleys beneath the Desert. There be many Asses and other wild beasts of the mountaines, and greate Pine apple trées. At the ende of this Deserte

there is a Citie called Catlogoria, whiche is towarde the North, and of this Citie was the first Prince or Lorde among the Tartars, and his name was Catlogoria. The Tartars dwel towards the North, wheras is but few cities & Townes, but true it is, there be fayre playnes, pastures, riuers, and very good waters. There dwell Tartars that haue no King nor Lorde, they doe gouerne themselues in common, and do pay tribute to Prester Iohn. It formned, that these Tartars multiplyed to so greate a number, that Prester Iohn did feare, that they woulde rise against him, therefore he determined with himselfe to sende certaine Lordes of his that shoulde be among them to kéepe them asunder, and also to kéepe the countrey in good order, and to banishe or diminishe parte of them, bycause they should not be of so greate a power. And the Tartars perceyuyng thys, ioyned themselues togither, and tooke councell, determined to leaue that countrey, and to goe and dwell vpon the mountaines and in the deserts, by meanes whereof from that time forwarde they stoode in no feare of Prester Iohn, nor woulde pay him tribute. And at the end of certaine yeares, that they were not vnder the obedience of Prester Iohn, they did elect and choose among themselues a King whiche they called Chenchis, a valiaunt and wise man: and this was in the yeare of oure Lorde God .1187. and crowned him for King of the Tartars aforesaide. And all the Tartars that were in Persia, and other Countreys there
                     •
                  boutes, came to him, and put themselues vnder his gouernement, and obeyed him as their King, and he receiued them very friendly, gouerning them iustely and discréetely. And after that Chenchis was confirmed, and had the whole gouernment, within a short time he made war, and in shorte time conquered righte Kingdomes or Prouinces, and when he hadde gotten anye Prouince or Citie, he did iniurie to no man, but lette them remaine wyth

their goods, sauing to those that were able and fitte menne for him, they he tooke with him into the warres, and by this meanes he was welbeloued, and all men were content to goe with him.
            
            
               Of the beginning of the raigne of the Tartars, and of many maruellous and straunge thinges. CHAP. 42.
               
                  
                     CHenchis perceyuyng himselfe to be of suche power, minding to ioyne himselfe in kindred or stocke with Prester Iohn, sente to him his Embassadoures, requiring his daughter in marriage: and this was in the yeare of oure Lord God .1190. Prester Iohn disdained that Embassage and aunswered, that he maruailed muche that Chenchis being his Subiecte shoulde presume to demaunde his Lordes daughter to be his wife, saying he woulde rather kil hir: so the matter remayned thus. Chenchis hearing this aunswere of Prester Iohn, was sore troubled and vexed in minde againste hym, and incontinent sent him defiaunce, saying, he woulde warre vppon him, and of this Prester Iohn made small reckning saying, that the Tartars were but slaues, and not menne of warre, notwithstanding he made himselfe in a readinesse, and came vpon Chenchis, who had also made himselfe in a readinesse, and came oute againste him and encountred togither in a great plaine called Tanguth, where it was appointed the battaile shoulde be of both parties, & thus ioyned togither in a fierce & lōg battel, for both parts

was strong, but in the end, Prester Iohn being slaine, and many of both parts,
                     Prester Iohn slaine in batte
                        •
                      by Chenchis King of the Ta

                        tars.
                   the field remayned to Chenchis, who conquered all the prouince, Cities, and townes of Prester Iohn, and raigned after his death sixe yeares, and at the end of sixe yeares, laying siege to a Castell, was hurte in the knée with an arrowe, and of that wounde dyed. After the death of this Chenchis, was made Lord of the Tartars one called Cane, and this was the firste that was called Emperoure and Greate Cane.
                  The first Emperour of the Tartars called Great Cane.
                   And after hym raigned Bathe Cane, and the fourth was called Chenchis Cane, & the fifth was Cublay Cane, which raigneth nowe. This Cublay Cane is the greatest and of most power of anye of al his predessors, for among the Christians and Heathen, there is not a greater Prince than he is, nor of so great a power, and that shall you cléerely perceyue hereafter, by that which followeth. All the Canes, successors of the first Chenchis, where bu
                     •
                  yed in a mountaine called Alchay, and there dwelled the greate Cane.
                  In this moū
                     taine Alchay, be al the gret Canes buryed. And when the greate Cane dyeth, they cary hym to be buryed there. Those that do cary him, or go with him, kill as manye as they méete withall in the waye or stréete, and when they kill them, they saye: Go, and serue our Lorde in the other worlde, & they beléeue certainely, that they go, and doe him seruice. And likewise by this reason, when the greate Cane dieth, they kill all his Camels, Horses, and Moyles, beléeuing that they sēd them to serue their Lord in the other worlde. When Monguy Cane Lorde of the Tartars dyed, there was slaine .300000. men that they encountred in the way, by those that wente wyth hym to hys buriall to the saide mountaine.
               The habitation of the Tartars in the Winter, is in the plaine fieldes, where it is warme, and good grasse and pasture for their Cattell, and in the Sommer in the mountaines and wooddes, where it is freshe and pleasaunt aire: and they make rounde houses of tymber, and couer them

with feltes, and these houses they carry with them at all times when they do remoue: and alwayes they sette their doore in the Sommer time towards the South, and in the Winter towardes the North. These Tartars haue theyr cartes of Wagons couered with blacke feltes, that neuer any water can passe through, and in these Cartes or Wagons go their wiues, children, and family, and their Cammels do drawe these Wagons. The Tartars wiues doe buy and sell al manner of things belonging to householde, or any thing néedefull: their husbands take no care for it, but onely in hawking, hunting, and going on warrefare. They do eate all manner of fleshe, and drinke milke of all kinde of beastes and mares. The Tartars maye take as manye wiues as they will, and maye marry with anye of their kinred, excepting no degrée: but their firste wife is the chiefest, and is moste made of: the women doe gyue their dowries to their husbandes. There is none of them will haue conuersation with an other mannes wife. And when the father dyeth, his eldest sonne doeth marry wyth his mother in lawe, and when the sonne dyeth, his brother marryeth with hys sister in lawe, and for the time do kéep great solemnitie and feastes at the wedding.

                  THe Greate Cane Emperour of the Tartars, doth worshippe for his God, and Idoll called Nochygay, and they saye and beléeue, that he is the eternall God, that taketh care to preserue hym, hys wiues, children, familie, cattell, and corne, and

hathe him in great reuerence, and euery one hath the figure of that Idoll in his house. And this Idoll is made of feltes, or of other cloth, and of the same felte or cloth they doe make wiues and children for their Idols, and the women be sette on the lefte side of the Idols,The Tartares doe make them Idols of feltes, and other baggage. and the children before them. When they thinke it dinner tyme, then they doe annoynte the mouthes and lippes of theyr Idols, and wiues and children, with the fatte of the sodden flesh, and do poure out the broath vpon the floore, saying, that theyr Idols, their wiues, and children doe fill themselues with it, and they do eate the sodden flesh, and their drinke is the milke of Mares trimmed with spices, that it is like white wine, and it is very good, and is called with them Cheminis.

Their harnesse is the Hydes of Buffe, or other thicke and strong Skynnes. The Tartares be valiant men of armes, and strong to abyde any trauell or laboure, and can well suffer hunger and thirst, for in the warres they be many times one moneth, and eate nothing, but of wylde beastes they doe kill in the field, and drinke Mares Milke. When they be in the field day and night they be on Horsebacke, and the bridle in their hands they giue the Horses meate. When their King setteth forward with his host, before and on euery side of him they do set foure battels of the best and most valiant men, for bycause their King shoulde not bée put in feare. And when he goeth a warrefare a farre off, he caryeth nothing with hym but hys armoure, and a thing to couer him when it doth rayne, and two flaggons with Milke for to drinke, and a Potte to séeth his meate in when néede is. In a tyme of néede hée will ride tenne days iourney, without eating any sodden meate. For his drinke, they will carrie Milke made like dry paste, and when hée is disposed to drinke, he will take a little of that

paste, and dissolue it in fayre water, and so drinke it:The Tarta

The Tartares haue thys custome,When any of the Tartares sonnes dye, and also a daughter of another, then they do marrie these two togither, saying, they shall be so in the other worlde. that if one of theyr sonnes dye being yong, and also of another man his daughter, after they be dead, they marrie them, saying, they shall be maried in the other worlde. And of thys Matrimonie they doe make a publike writing, and this writing they burne, saying to the dead, that as the smoke thereof ascendeth on high, so doe they sende them that writing, declaring theyr mariage. And at suche mariages they make great feasting and solemnitie, and do séeth muche victuals, and poure out the broath vppon the floore, saying, that those which be dead in this world, and maried in the other, do eate of the victuals prepared for the wedding. And besides all this, they cause to be painted the figure of the sonne and daughter, vppon the backside of the foresayde writing, and withall the pictures of manye Camels, and other diuers beasts, and apparell and money, and many other things, saying, that as that writing dothe burne, all those things therein goe straight way to their chyldren, after the smoke as aforesayde, and the fathers and mothers of these children that dyed, doe take hands togither, and be alwayes after friendes, and Grandfathers and Grandmothers, and Cousens, euen as though they had bin maried aliue.

                  WHen the great Cane will make sacrifice, he poureth out the Mares milke vpon the ground,A superstitious beliefe y• great Cane hath. and in the ayre, and the Prophets of his gods say, that milke poured out, is the holye Ghoste, of the which all the Idols be ful, and do beléeue, that this sacrifice is the cause of his confirmation, and of his subiects, & of al his other things. And this sacrifice he doth euery yere ye 29. day of August. And to those white horses and Mares wheresoeuer they do go, they do great reuerence. This greate Cane hath in his Court certaine Negromanciers, whiche by arte of the Diuel, when it is foule & troubleseme weather, it shal be fayre and cleare weather in his Pallace. And do gyue to vnderstande to the people, that the clearnesse is ouer the Pallace where the great Cane is, only for his deserts and holy life, and by vertue of his Idols. When anye one is iudged to dye, as soone as he is deade they séeth him, and eate him, but those that dye by natural death, be meat for their Idols.
               And besides thys, when the great Cane is at hys table, these inchaunters doe worke by arte of the Diuel, that Cuppes doe rise from the table tenne Cubits into the ayre, and do set themselues down again,Here his enchaunters do worke by the Diuel. and whē they wyll doe this, they demaunde of the greate Cane a blacke shéepe, and the wood of Alloe and Incense, & other swéete spyces, wherof there is great plenty, bicause their sacrifice

séeme the more swéeter, and he commaundeth to be deliuered to them, what they will haue, for bycause they beléeue that their Idols doe preserue and kéepe him and all his companie. These Prophets and Priestes, do cause the flesh to be sodden with spices in presence of their Idols, & do put incense therin, and poure the broth into the ayre, & they say the Idol taketh of it what pleaseth him: and thys they do with gret singing. Euery Idol hath his name, and to euery one they do this worship on their dayes, as we do on our saints dayes. They haue many Monasteries deputed to the names of their Idols. There is in that countrey one Monasterie as big as a good Citie,A great Monas

Vpon their feaste dayes they kepe great solemnity, with singing, and praysing, and lights, and some of these religious men haue many wiues, and some of them liue chaste: the chast do eate the branne and the meale kneaded togither, with a little hote water, and do fast oftentimes in reuerence of their Idols, and do weare garments made of Canuas died blacke or blewe, & some white, and do lye in Almadraques, sharpe and harde beds, and the other religious that be maried, they go well apparelled, and do eate and drinke wel, and doe saye that those which liue the streight life be Heretickes and fooles, bycause they do punish their bodies, by meanes whereof they can not honor their Idols as they ought to do, and as reason is. All the Idols of these married religious men, they do name by the name of women, bycause they be such leacherous people.
            
            
               
               Of a victorie the great Cane had. CHAP. 53.
               
                  HEre, for your better information, I wyll declare vnto you of a victory the gret Cane had, wherby you shal the better vnderstand and know of his strength and power. It was he that now raigneth, which was called Cublay Cane, whiche is as muche to saye, as Lorde of Lordes. You shall vnderstande that this Cublay Cane descended lineally of the imperiall stocke, from Chenchis Cane, from whence he must descende, that shall be Lorde of the Tartares: and this Cublay Cane, beganne his raigne in the yere of our Lord God .1256. And as Chenchis Cane by his prouidence and wisedome, made himselfe the firste Lord of the Tartares, as is before declared, so likewise this for his wisdome and prouidence, contrarie to the good will of his kinred, that would haue put him out of it, did so cō
                  serue and gouerne his Dominions and Countries, til the yeare of our Lord God .1298. so that he raigned two and fortie yeares, and was fiue and forty yeares old when he was made Emperor, and euerye yeare hadde warres, for he was valiant and expert in the warres, but he himselfe after he was made Emperour, neuer went to the warres but one time, but alwayes sent his sonnes, or some noble men, whom he thought best. And the cause wherefore hée went at that time in person, was this. In the yeare of our Lord God .1286. a nephew of his, of the age of thirtie yeares Lord of many prouinces, Cities, and townes, perceyuing himselfe to be subiecte to the greate Cane, as his predecessors had ben, determined in himself not to be subiect to anye, and concorded with another kinseman of the

great Canes, whyche was called Cardin, whyche mighte well make .100000. Horsemen, and was mortall enimie to the greate Cane hys vncle, and did moue warre both of them with theyr hostes agaynste the great Cane, and hée hauyng knowledge thereof, dyd not feare, for hée was a Prince of maruellous greate power: but incontinent he called hys people togither for to go against hys enimies, and toke an oth, that the crowne shoulde neuer come on his head, till that he had cruelly reuenged hymselfe on them as Traytors and Rebels, so that within two and twenty days, he had ioyned particularly a great host of thrée hundred thousand fighting men,Three hundred thousand fighting men. of horsemen and footemen, and woulde ioyne no greater an host, nor haue it published abrode, that his enimies shoulde haue knowledge of it, and also for that he had many of his men of warre abroade in other places on warfare, and coulde not bring them togither in so short a time. But you shall vnderstande that when the greate Cane will make his power, and take time to doe it, he may ioyne so greate a number, that it were a greate trouble to number them. These thrée hundred thousande of fighting men, be not all menne of experience, for there were aboue foure thousande Falconers, and Seruants, and Courtiers that attended vppon the Kings person, and serued in his Courts. But thus hauing his hosts ioyned, he commanded to be called before him his Astrologers, and would know of them in what sort and time he shoulde set forward on this enterprise, and they answered him that the time was good, and that he shoulde haue victorie ouer his enimies, and so incontinent set forwarde on his way with his people, and came to a playne, where as was Nauia with .200000. men tarrying there the comming of Caydu with another hundred thousand of horsemen, for to set on the Countreys of the great Cane. The Lordes of

the great Cane had beset all the wayes, and taken all the streytes, that neither succoure shoulde come, nor his enimies flée, bycause he would take them all prisoners. Nauia knowing nothing of this, or that the great Cane had prepared himselfe for any warre,The pollicie of the great Cane.
                   for the greate Cane had before beset all the wayes and passages, that no mā could passe to carrie any newes to Nauia, and by this meanes, not thinking nor stāding in any doubt, thought he might well take his rest that nighte, and all his people: but the

                     •
                  med, and vnprouided, not thinking any thing of it, and perceyuing it, he was in greate feare. And the great Cane had made a great frame vpon an Elephant, wherin his standerdes were caried, and before and behinde, and by the sides went his battels of Horsemen and footemen, that is to say .25000. in a battell. And with these battels be sette all the host of Nauia round, and when Nauia sawe thys, he lept on horsebacke, and caused his trumpets to blowe, and set his armie in as good order as he could, and so ioyned battell, whereas was a great and strong fighte, and continued from morning till nighte, and greate number slayne on both parties, but at the end Nauia and his company were not able any longer to withstande the furie of the greate Canes armed men, and beganne to flée, in such sort, that Nauia was taken prisoner, and his people not being able to doe anye good, submitted themselues to the great Cane: and Nauia being presented aliue to the great Cane, he caused him to be bounde vp in a Carpet, and so long hée vsed him to bée caried, that hée dyed,A strange kind of death to his cousin. and thys deathe hée gaue hym, for that hée woulde not haue the bloud of Nauia béeing of his kindred, fall to the grounde, nor that the ayre shoulde sée hym dye an euill deathe.

After that Nauia was deade, all his Lordes and other prisoners became sworne to the great Cane, to be obediēt to him. These foure prouinces were vnder the obedience of Nauia, that is to say, Furciorcia, Guli, Baston, Scincinguy.
               
               Now that I haue shewed you of the great Cane, howe he paste with Nauia, I will also declare vnto you, of hys manner, condition, and person, and of his wiues and children, and of other things.

               Of a greate Citie called Cambalu, and of all the goodly and maruellous things that be done there. CHAP. 55.
               
                  NOw I will declare vnto you of the worthy and noble Citie called Cambalu,
                  
                     Cambalu. This is a goodly Citie, and well ordered. the whiche is in the prouince of Cathaya. This Citie is foure and twenty myles compasse, and is fouresquare, that is, to euery quarter sixe miles compasse. The wall is very strong, of twenty paces high, and battlements of thrée paces high. The wall is fiue paces thicke, This Citie hathe twelue gates, and at euery gate is a very faire pallace. And vpon the toppe of euery corner of the said wal is also a faire pallace, and in all these pallaces ioyning to the wall be many people appoynted for to watch and kéepe the Citie. And in those pallaces be all maner of armour and weapons for the defence and strength of the Citie. The stréetes of this Citie be so faire and streight, that you may sée a Candle or fire

from the one ende to the other. In this Citie be manye fayre Pallaces and houses. And in the middest of it is a notable greate and faire Pallace, in the whiche there is a great Toure, wherein there is a greate Bell, and after that Bell is tolled thrée times, no body may goe abroade in the Citie, but the watchmen that be appoynted for to kéepe the Citie, and the nurses that doe kéepe children newly borne, and Phisitions that goe to visit the sicke, and these may not go without light. At euery gate nightlye there is a thousand men to watch, not for feare of any enimies,At euery gate is a thousand m

                     n that do watch. but to auoyde théeues and robbers in the Citie, which many times do chance in the Citie. And this great watche the greate Cane doth cause, to conserue and kéepe h
                     •
                  s people and subiects, that no man should do them hurt, Without this Citie be twelue suburbes very greate, and euery one of thē answereth to his gate of ye Citie. And in these be many Merchantes and men of occupations: and thyther do resort all people that come out of the Countreys,
                     No common woman may dwell within the Citie.
                     Aboue a thousande Cartes with silke goeth euery daye out of this Line.
                     The greate Cane is garded nightly, with twentie thousande Horsemen.

                   and such Lordes as haue to do with the King or his Courtes. And in these suburbes be moe than twentye thousande single or common women, and neuer a one of them maye dwell within the Citie on payne of burning. Out of this Citie goeth euery daye aboue a thousande Cartes with silke. The great Cane is garded euery night with twentie thousande Gentlemen on Horsebacke, not for any feare, but for dignitie. They be called Chisitanos, which is as much to say, as Knightes for the body, or trustie Knights. The manner of the great Cane for his dinner, is this: They make ready all the Tables rounde about the Hall, and in the middest of the Hall, is made ready the Table for the greate Cane, setting his backe towardes the North, and his face towardes the South. His firste wife sitteth next vnto him on hys lefte hande, and his other wiues following orderly. On his other side do sitte his sonnes, and his sonnes children, one after another,

according to his age. Those that be of the imperiall lignage, do sitte downe afterward at another table more lower. And the other Lords and their wiues do sitte at other Tables more lower, according to their degrées, dignities, offices, estates, and age. At the saide Tabl

                      will holde tenne Hogsheads of Wine, and four of siluer bigger than that. and euery one may sée the great Cane as he sitteth at his dinner. In the middest of the Hall is a very greate vessell or cesterne of fine gold, that will holde tenne Hoggesheads, which is alwayes kept full of perfect good drinke. And néere vnto that vessell be other foure vessels of siluer bigger than that, full of good wine, with many other vessels and pottes by them, of gold, and of siluer, which may be of pottels a péece, or as muche as will serue foure men for a dinner. At dinner, out of the vessell of golde, wyth pottes of golde, they drawe wine for to serue the greate Cane his Table, for him, his wiues, children, and kindred: and out of the vesselles of siluer,
                     Euery one that sitteth at the tables, hath a cuppe of gold before him.
                     Euery one that bringeth meate or drinke to the Table, hath a towell of golde and silke before his mouth.
                   with Iars and Pottes of siluer, they drawe wine to serue the Lordes and the Ladies, and all others sitting at the Tables, as well wemen as men. And euery one that sitteth at the tables hathe a cuppe of golde before hym to drinke in. And euery one that bringeth anye seruice to the greate Canes Table, hathe a towell of golde and silke before his mouth, bycause his breath shall not come vppon the meate and drinke they bring. When the great Cane will drinke, all the Musitians that bée in the Hall doe play, and euery one that serueth, knéeleth downe tyll hée haue drunke. In the Hall be alwayes Iesters, Iuglers, and fooles, attending vpon the Tables, to make pastime all dynner tyme, and after Dinner is done, and the Tables taken vppe,Great feast is made euerie yeare, the day when the great Cane was borne. euerie man goeth aboute his businesse. All the Tartares kéepe greate feasting and chéere euery yeare on the daye that Cublay Cane was borne, which was on the eight and twentith day of September,

and that is the greatest feast they make in all the yeare saue one, that héereafter shall be spoken of. The greate Cane doth apparell himselfe that day he was borne on in cloth of golde maruellous rich, and .12000. Barōs be apparelled with him after the same sorte touching the cloth of gold,He giueth a rich Liuerie. but not so rich and preciouse, and euery one of thē hath a great girdle of gold, and that apparell and girdles the great Cane giueth them.Euery Liuerie is worth a thousande Markes. And there is neuer a one of those garments with the girdle, but it is worth .10000. Bisancios of golde, whiche may be a thousand Markes. By this you may perceyue, that he is of great power and riches. And on the sayde day, all the Tartares, and Merchantes, and subiects, and those that dwell in his Countreys, be bounde to presente vnto hym euery one somethyng, according to his degrée and abilitie, in knowledging him to be their Lorde. And whatsoeuer he be that doth begge any office or gift of him, must giue him a present, according to the gift he doth aske. And all his Subiects and Merchantes, and trauellers, or anye other that be founde in his Countreys or Prouinces, be vsually bounde to pray for the greate Cane to hys Idols, to preserue hym and hys Countreys, whether they be Tartares or Christiane,The Tartares begin their yeare the first day of February. or Iewes, or Moores. The Tartares begin their yeare the firste day of February, and do kéepe a great feast that day. And the greate Cane and hys Barons, with all the rest of the Citie, doe apparell themselues in white that daye, making greate pastymes, saying, the greate Cane is bl

his temple, whiche is all fraude and guile of the inchanters for to gette victuals, by this meanes all are damned vnto Hell. To this banket there is conuited the maisters and ministers of the Idols, the inchanters and women that serue in ye temple of that Idoll. And before they sitte downe to the Table, they doe sprincle the broath aboute the house, singing and daunsing in the honor of that Idoll. And they doe aske the Idoll, if he haue forgiuen the sicke man. And sometimes the Féende aunswereth, that there lacketh such or suche a thing, whiche immediately they do prouide: and when he answereth that he is pardoned, then they do sitte downe to eate and to drinke that sacrifice which is drest with spices, and this done, they go vnto his house with great ioy. If the paciente heale, it is good for him, but if he dye, it is an euerlasting payne for him, and if he recouer, they do beléeue that the diuelishe Idol hath healed him, and if he die, they say that the cause of his deathe was for the greate offence that he had done vnto him, and so they be lost as brute beasts in all that Countrey.

And then I Marcus Paulus tooke vppon mée this charge, and gathered togither certaine Venetians that I founde in those Countries, being discréete menne, and exercised in feates of armes, and I caused to be made thrée greate Trabuco or greate péeces of ordinaunce, whiche shotte a pellet of a thousande pounde waighte, and hadde them vnto the campe, and planted them where they should be shotte off, and this done, by the meanes of these péeces I shotte into the Citie greate pellettes, and when those of the Citie saw their houses fall about their eares, by suche meanes as they neuer saw nor hearde of before, they receyued great feare, and immediately they yéelded themselues vnto the great Cane.

                  GOyng from Siamphu, and trauelling fiftéene dayes iourney towardes Syroco, or to the Easte southeast, you come vnto the Citie named Singuy, wherevnto belongeth a greate number of ships:The riuer Tnoguron the greatest riuer in the world, and this Citie is scituated vpon the greatest riuer of the world named Tuognrou which is .17. miles in breadth, and one hundred dayes iorney in length, and there is neuer a riuer in the worlde,Fiue thousan̄d vessels on this riuer. where there sayleth so manye shippes with Merchaundizes, as there. And I Marcus Paulus was in this Citie, and did tell standing vpon a bridge at one time fiue thousande shippes or barkes that sailed vppon this riuer, and vppon this riuer there standeth two hundred Cities. being greater than this that we haue spoken of. Thys riuer passeth throughe sixetéene prouinces.

This Citie standeth towardes the Siroco, and they doe carry this prouision vnto

                  Cambalu vpon this riuer, and not by sea. Therefore there commeth through this riuer greate profite vnto Cambalu, for it is better prouided with barkes than with cartes, or horses.

And now I will beginne of the Iland named Ciampagu, whiche standeth in the high Sea towardes the Orient, and it is separated from the mayne land .1500. miles.

And the great Cane knowing of the greate fame and riches of this Iland, determined to conquere it, and caused to be made great prouision of munition and vittayles, and a greate number of Shippes, and in them he put many Horsemen and footemen, and sent them vnder the gouernance of two of his Captaynes, the one was named Abatan, and the other Vonsaucin, and these two went with this great armie from the Hauen of Iaython and of Glunsay, and they went vnto the Iland Ciampagu, where they went alande, and hauing done great hurt in Mountaynes and valleys, there entred suche enuie and hatred betwéene these two Captaynes, and so much discord, that loke what the one would haue done, the other did againe say it, and through this meanes they toke neyther Citie nor Towne, but only one, and they killed all them that they founde therein, for that they would not yéeld, sauing eyght men, whyche could not be killed with any iron,Men hauing stones that were inchanted, could not be slaine with weapons of iron, but with clubbes. for that eache of them had a precio

And as soone as it was caulme on the Sea, the

King of this Iland which had bin so spoyled, wente with a great armie of Shippes vnto the other Ilande, where as they were gone to haue taken them that were fledde, and as soone as hée was on lande with his men, the Tartares like wise and politike men, retired backe by the Ilande, and went vnto the Shyppes of this King whiche they had lefte without strength, entred in, hoysed vp the Sayles, with the Auncientes and Flagges of that King, whiche they left behinde in the Ilande, and sayled vnto the first Iland, where they were receyued,The Citie taken by a prettie meanes. and the gates opened, thinking it had bin their owne King. And in thys manner the Tartares tooke that Citie, wherein the King had his habitation, and ransacked it. And as soone as the King of this Ilande knewe of it, he caused many other Shippes to be prepared, and with the men that hée had, and many of her that hée tooke of new, enuironed his proper Citie, hauyng it beséeged seauen moneths.

Whē the people of this Iland do take in battell any stranger, if he doe not caunsome himselfe for money, they kill him, drinke his bloud, and eate his flesh. This Ilande is enuironed round about with the Occean sea. The portes are frée for themselues. The Marriners which vse that Sea,

And I Marcus Paulus was in this countrey in the yeare of our Lord .1275. and I found this King very olde. He had many wiues, and amongst sonnes and daughters he had .325.This King had .325. children.

And in the middes of this Iland, about forty miles, there is but foure passes of water, therefore the great Shippes do take off their Rudders: and being paste these fiue miles towards the midday, you come vnto a Realme named Malenir. The Citie and the Iland is named Pepethan, where there is plentie of Spices. And going forwarde, sayling by Solano, or East, and by South a hundred miles, you come vnto the Ilande named Iaua the lesse, which is in compasse two hundred miles.

In this realme there be Apes of diuerse sorts, and Vnicornes, little lesse than Elephants, hauing a head like vnto a swyne, and alwayes hanging it downward to the grounde, and standeth with a good will in Cieno or miery puddel. They haue but one horne in their forehead, wherby only they are called Vnicornes, theyr horne is large and blacke, their tong is rough and full of prickles long and thicke. The Apes of this country are small, hauing a face like vnto a childe, and those in that countrey do flaye them, so that they looke like vnto a naked childe.

They haue manye trees like vnto the paulme trée, they breake the braunches and from them commeth water, as it commeth from the vyne. This licour is white and redde like vnto Wine, béeing very perfect to drinke, there is great plentie of it. Another realme there is in this Iland, which is named Deragoya, the people are rusticall, and worship Idols. They haue no king, and speake the Persian speach. In this Iland there groweth great plentie of the Indian nuts. They haue this custome in this Iland, that when any falleth sicke, his kinsfolke demaunde of them if the patient shall liue or dy. Then these maisters make Diuellish inchauntments, if they say that he shall escape, they let him lye, and if they say that he shall dye, they sende for the Butchers, whiche stoppe his breath till he dye, and when he is deade, they séeth the bodie▪ and the parents eate the flesh, and kepe his bones in a chest. Thys they do, saying, if the wormes had eaten the fleshe they should die for hunger, and the soule of

the deade bodie shoulde iuffer greate penurie in the other world. They do hide this chest with the bones, in a caue of the mountaines, so that it maye not be founde. All the straungers that they doe finde, they kil and eate them, if they be not ransomed for money as soone as they take them.

In this realme there be men that haue feathers about their priuities, great and bigge, and of the length of a goose quill. The fift realme of this Iland Iaua is named Samphur, where there is found the best Camphore that is in the world, and it is solde for the waight of gold: here they do vse the Wine of trées. In this prouince there is a kinde of great trée, and it hath a very thinne ryne, and vnder the ryne it is full of singular meale, and of thys meale they do make perfect meats, of the which I Marcus paulus did eat many times.

The people of Necumea, liue like beastes, the men and women go naked, couering no part of their secrets: they do vse carnallye like beasts or dogs in the stréets, or wheresoeuer they doe finde, without any shame at all, hauing no difference, nor regard, the father vnto the daughter, nor the sonne vnto ye mother, more than vnto another woman, but euery one doth as he lusteth or may. Here there be mountaines of Sandolos or Saūders, and of nuts of India, and of Gardamonia, and many other spyces. Nangama is the other Ilande, it is fayre and great. The people therof are Idolaters, they liue beastly, and eate mens flesh, they are very cruel, they` haue heades lyke great Mastie dogges, and the men and women haue téeth like dogs. In this Ilande there is great plentie of spices.

In this Iland there is a very rich king, the people are Idolatours, and they goe all naked in this Ilande, sauing that they do weare a linnen cloth before their secretes. There is great plentie of Rice and of cattel, and of the Wyne of trées. In this Iland are founde the best Rubies, that bée in the worlde, and they be founde in no other place than here. And here there be founde manye precious stones, as Topases, Amatistes, and of diuerse other kindes. Thys king hath the fairest Rubie in the world, the length of a spanne, and is as thicke as ones arme, as redde as fire, glistering without any blemmish. The men of this countrey are wonderfull leacherous, and they are worth nothing for the warres.
            
            
               
               Of the prouince named Moabar, vvherin there be fiue kingdomes, and of the noble things that be founde there. CHAP. 116.
               
                  PAssing from thys sayde place, and trauelling towardes the Occident fortie myles, you come vnto a greate prouince nam
                     •
                  d Moabar in the great India. This is the greatest and the best prouince that is in ye world, standing in the firme land, being an excellent regigion. There is in thys prouince, Margarites verye fayre and great. This prouince is diuided into fiue kingdomes, wherevpon raigneth fiue brethren legitimate. In the first beginning of this prouince standeth the firste kingdome gouerned by one of those fiue brethren, named Sendarba, and is entituled as king of Nor, here is fine great pearles, in great number. This king hath the tenth of all ye pearls whych are founde in his kingdome. The fishermen do fish these pearles, from the beginning of April, vntill the middest of May, in a gulfe of the Sea, where there is greate plentie of them, they are founde in the Oysters. The men and women of this realme goe all naked, sauing that they do weare a certaine cloth to couer theyr priuities. Also the king goeth naked, and to be knowen, he weareth about his necke a lace full of precious stones, whyche are in number a hundereth & foure, in the remembrance of a hundreth & foure prayers, that he vseth to say in the honour of his gods morning and euening, and on his armes, legges, féete, and téeth, he weareth so manye precious Stones, that tenne riche Cities be not able to paye for them.
               
                  This king hath fiue hundreth wiues, and one of them he toke from his brother. In this realme there be verye faire women of themselues: also they do vse paynting, s
                     •
                  tting more beautie vnto their faces and on their bodies. Thys king ha
                     •
                  h alwayes a greate companie with him, to serue him: when the king dyeth they burne his bodye, and with him of their owne voluntarie willes, all those that accompanied and serued him in his life time, leape into the fire, and burne themselues with him, saying, that they do go to beare their king companie in ye other world, and liue as they did here in this worlde. Yerely this King buyeth tenne thousande horses of the countrey named Cormos, at the price of fiue ounces of gold euery horse, some more, some lesse, according vnto the goodnesse and beautie of the horse. The merchaunts of Quinsay, of Suffer, and of Beden, sell those horses vnto the merchauntes of this realme. These horses lyue not in this prouince aboue one yeare: by this meanes that king consumeth a greate part of his treasure in horses. In this countrey they doe vse this custome, that is, when a man is condemned to dy, he is begged of the Prince that he maye kill himselfe, and when they haue obtayned the kings good will, he killeth himselfe, in the loue and honour of his Idols. After thys wise, hauing obtayned the kings grace and fauour, the wife of this malefactour and kinred, taketh him, tying about his necke twelue kniues, and in this manner he is carried by them vnto a place of iustice, where he crieth as lowde as he may, saying, I doe kill my selfe in the honour and for the loue of suche an Idoll, and with one of these kniues striketh himselfe, and then with another, vntyll such time as he falleth downe deade: this done, hys parents with great ioye and gladnesse burne the dead body, thinking that he is happy. In this countrey euerye man hath as many wiues as he is able to maintain: whē ye husbande

dyeth, according vnto their custome, his bodie is burnt, and 
                     •
                  is wiues of their owne frée willes burne themselues with him, and shée that leapeth firste into the fire, the beholders take hir to be the best. They are all Idolaturs, and for the more part of them, worship the Oxe, saying, he is a Sainct, for that he laboureth and tilleth the grounde, where the corne growth, and so by no manner of meanes they will eate anye kinde of Oxe fleshe, nor yet for all the golde in the world, will they kill an Oxe, and when any Oxe dyeth, with his tallow they do rubbe al the insides of their houses.
               These people descende of those that killed Saint Thomas the Apostle, and none of them can enter into Sainct Thomas Churche, whiche he edified in that countrey: besides this, if one will presume to enter into the Temple, he falleth streight deade. It hath bene proued oftentimes, that some of them would enter perforce into the Church, and it hath not bin possible for them doe it. The king and those of this prouince eate alwayes vpon the ground, and if it be demaunded of them by question why they doe so, they doe aunsweare, for that they doe come of the earth, and to the earth they muste, and they cannot doe so much honour vnto the Earth as is worthy. In thys prouince there groweth nothing else but Rice: these people go naked vnto the warres, hauing no other weapon but speare and shield, and they kill no wilde beastes at all for their eating, but they cause some other that is not of their lawe to kill them. All the men and women do wash themselues twice aday, morning, and euening, for otherwise they dare neyther eate nor drinke, and he that should not kepe this vse among them, shoulde be reputed to bée and Hereticke: and they do washe themselues in thys manner, as we haue rehearsed: they goe all naked, and so they go vnto the riuer, and 
                     •
                  ake of the water, and powre it vpon their heads, and then one doth helpe to washe another.

They are good men of warre, and verye fewe of them drinke wine, and those that doe drinke it, are not taken to be as a witnesse, nor yet those that go vnto the Sea, saying, that the Marriners are dronkards. They are desperate men, and estéeme lecherie to be no sinne. This countrey is intollerable hote, and the boyes go altogither naked. It neuer rayneth in that Countrey, sauing in Iune, Iuly, and August. In this Region there be many Philosophers, and many that vse Negromancie, and verye manie of them that tell fortunes. There be Hawkes as blacke as Rauens, bigger than ours, and good to kill the game. Also, there be Owles as bigge as Hennes, that flye in the ayre all night. Many of those men doe offer their children vnto those Idols that they haue most respect vnto, and when they worship and feast those Idols, they do cause to come before them, all the yong men and maydes, whiche are offered vnto them, and they doe sing and daunce before the Idols, and this done, they do cause their meate to be broughte thither, and they doe eate the flesh, saying, that the smell of the flesh filleth the Idols.
            
            
               Of the Realme named Musuly, vvhere there be found Adamants, and many Serpents, and of the manners of those in that Countrey. CHAP. 117.
               
                  
                     MVsuly is a Region that standeth beyonde Moabar, trauelling towards Septentrion which is the North .1000. miles. The people of this Realme worship Idols. And in the Mountaynes of this Countrey, there be found fine Adamants. And after they haue had muche rayne, the men goe to séeke them in

the streames that runne from the Mountaynes, and so they do find the Adamants, whiche are brought from the Mountaynes in Sommer when the dayes are long. Also, there be strong Serpents and great, very venemous, séeming that they were serte there to kéepe the Adamantes that they might not be taken away, and in no parte of the world there is found fine Adamants but there.

                  re be in this Countrey the biggest Shéepe in the worlde. And in the Prouince of Moabar aforenamed, lyeth the body of the Apostle Sainct Thomas, buryed in a small Citie, whither there goeth but few Merchants, for that it standeth farre from the Sea. There dwell manye Christians and Moores, hauing great reuerence vnto the body of S
                        •
                     inct Thomas, for they doe beléeue and say, that he was a Moore, and a great Prophet, and they do call him Thomas Dauana, which is to say, a holy man. The Christians that go on Pilgrimage to visit the body of Saincte Thomas, take of that earth where he was martired, and when any falleth sicke, they doe giue him of it to drinke, with wine and water. In the yeare of our Lorde .1297. it chanced there to be a miracle in this wise: A Knight gathered so much Rice, that he had no place to put it in, but put it into a house of Sainct Thomas, and the Christian men desired him not to pester the holy Apostles house with his Rice, where the Pilgrims did lodge, yet the Knighte would not heare them, and the same night, the spirite of Sainct Thomas appeared with a Gallowes of iron in his hande, putting it aboute the Knightes necke, and sayde, If thou cause not thy Rice to be taken out of the house of Sainct Thomas, I will hang thée. This miracle the Knight told with his owne mouth, vnto all the people of that Countrey, and forthwith the Christians rendred hartie thankes to the holy Apostle, who dothe many miracles on the Christians that committe themselues deuoutely vnto him: All the people of this Countrey

be blacke, not bycause they be so borne, but for that they woulde be blacke, they annoynt themselues with a kind of oyle, called oyle of Ai
                        •
                     niolly, for the blackest are estéemed most fayre. Also, the people of this Countrey cause their Idols to be paynted blacke, and the Diuels to be painted white, saying, that God and his Sainctes are blacke, and the Diuels white. When they of this Countrey go on warfare, they weare hattes vpon their heads, made of the hides of wild Oxen, and vpon their shieldes. And to the féete of their Horses, they fasten the heares of an Oxe, saying, that Oxen heares be holy, and haue thys vertue, that whosoeuer carieth of them aboute him, can receyue no hurt nor danger.

                  GOing from that Towne of Sainct Thomas towardes the Occidente, you come vnto a Prouince named Lahe, and there dwell the men named Bragmanos, which are the truest men in the world. They will not lye for all the worlde, nor yet consent vnto any falsehoode for all the world. They are very chast people, being contented only with one woman or wife. They neuer drinke wine, and by no manner of meanes they will take another mans goodes, nor will eate fleshe, nor kill any kinde of beast for all the world. They do honour the Idols, and haue much vnderstanding in the arte of Fortunes. Before they doe conclude anye greate bargayne, and before they doe anye thing of importance, firste they doe consider theyr shadowe agaynste the Sunne, whereby they iudge the thyng that they muste doe by certayne

rules which they haue deputed for it. They doe eate and drinke temperately. They are neuer let bloud, therefore they be very wise. In this Countrey there be many religious men, which are named Cingnos, and liue a hundred and fiftie yeares, for their greate abstinence and good liuing. In this Countrey there be also certayne religious men Idolaters, who goe altogither naked, couering no part of their body, saying, that of themselues they be pure and cleane from all sinne. These doe worship the Oxe. These religious men weare eache of them vppon his forhead an Oxe made in mettall. They do oynt all their bodie with an oyntment, which they make with great reuerence of the marou of an Oxe. They do neyther eate in dishes, nor vppon trenchers, but vppon the leaues of the Apple trée of Paradise, and other drye leaues, and not gréene by no manner of meanes, for they saye, that the gréene leafe hath life and soule. They do sléepe naked vppon the ground.

                     ORbay is a Kingdome that standeth towards the Orient, or the East, beyond Marbar fiue miles. In this Kingdome there be Christians, Iewes, and Moores. The King of Orbay payeth no tribute. Héere groweth more Pepper, than in any place of the world. There is a thyng in couloure redde, which they do call Indyaco, there is plē
                  tie, and it is good to dye withall, and is made of hearbes. A man can scarce kéepe himselfe in health, for the greate heate that is there, whiche is so vehemente, that if you should put an Egge in the water of the riuer at such time

as the Sunne hathe his strength, it woulde séeth it as though it were put in séething or scalding water. There is greate trade of merchandise in this Countrey,Great trade for Pepper by reason of the quantity. by reason of the greate gaynes. There is very muche Pepper, and very good cheape. In thys Countrey there be manye and strange Beastes to beholde. There groweth no other kynde of grayne for sustenance, but Rice. There bée many Phisitions and Astrologers. The men and women are blacke, and go naked, sauing that they do couer theyr priuities. Héere they do marrie the Cousen with the cousen, and the sonne in lawe with the mother in lawe, and throughout all India they do kéepe this manner of wedding

                     COmate is a Countrey of India, from whence you can not sée the North Starre, nor yet it can not be séene from the Ilande named Iaua to this place. But going from hence, sayling vppon the Sea thirtie miles, you shall discouer the North Starre streight. In this Countrey there are verye strange people, and verye strange Beastes, but specially Apes that are like men.

where they are all Idolaters. The King of this place is very rich of treasure, but he is weake of people. Thys Countrey is so strong, that no man can enter into it perforce. And when any Shippe commeth thither by force of weather, or otherwise, those of the Countrey robbe hym, saying, that those Shyps come not thither, but to robbe them, and therefore they do earnestly beléeue that it is no sinne to robbe them. Héere be Lyons, and other wylde beastes a great number.

Out of thys Realme and the nexte, there goe manye Shippes vnto the Sea a rouing, whiche robbe all kind of people. They do carrie with them their wiues and chyldren, and they sayle in all the Sommer a hundred Shippes togither, and when they doe come to the shore, they roue into the Countrey a hundred miles, taking all that they can finde, doyng no hurte vnto the people, saying vnto them, Go, and gette more, for peraduenture you shall come againe into our hands. In this Countrey there is plentye of Pepper,Plenty of Pepper and Ginger, and Turbit. of Ginger, and of Turbit, which is certayne rootes for medicines. Of thys Countrey, and their conditions, I will not rehearse, for it would be very tedious, therefore I will passe vnto the Realme of Giesurath.

                     GIesurath, is a Kingdome, in lawe, faith, and tong of the Persians, standing towards the Occidente. All the people are Idolaters. Frō hence you maye playnely sée the North Starre. In this kingdome be the worst and cruellest Rouers in the worlde, they doe take the Merchantes, not onely taking their goodes, but setting a price of their ransome for their bodyes, and if they do not pay it in a short time, they giue them so great tormentes, that many dye of it. Héere they worke good Leather of all maner of coloures.

                  GOing from Giesurath towardes the Occidente, you come vnto the Kingdomes of Thoma & vnto Sembelech. In these Realmes there is al kind of Merchandizes. And these Realmes haue the language and fayth of Persia, and in none of them both there groweth anye other sustenance than Rice. They are Realmes and Prouinces of India the great.

               Of tvvo Ilands, the one of men, and the other of women, Christians, and how there is much Amber. CHAP. 126.
               
                  WHen you go from Besmaceian, sayling thorough the meane sea towards the midday or South .25. miles, you come vnto two Ilandes of Christians, the one thirtie miles distant from the other. The Iland where there is all men, is named Masculine, and the other where there is all women, is named Feminine. The people of those Ilands are as one. The men go not vnto the women, nor the women vnto the men, but thrée monethes in the yeare, as to witte, August, September, and October, and these thrée moneths, the men and women are togither, and at the third moneths end, they returne vnto their owne houses, doing the rest of their businesse by thēselues. The children Males tarrie with their mothers vntill they be seauen yeares of age, and then they goe vnto their fathers. In this Ilande there is greate plentye of Amber, by reason of the greate number of Whales that they do take. In thys Iland they are good

fishers, and take greate plentie of fishe, and dr

               Of the Iland named Discorsia, vvhiche are Christians, and of the things that be founde there. CHAP. 127.
               
                  GOing from these two Ilandes, and sayling towards the middaye 500. myles▪ you come vnto an Ilande named Discorsia, wherein are Christians, and haue an Archebishoppe. Here is great abundāce of Amber. Also they do make very faire clothes of Cottenwooll, the people goe all naked without any clothing. Here is the stall of Rouers and Pirates, and the Christians buy with a good wil the goods whiche they bring, & haue robbed, for that these Pyrates do not robbe but only the Moores and Paynims, and meddle not with the Christians. When a ship sayleth vnder sayle with a prosperous winde, a whole day, the day following the Pyrates, with inchauntmentes of the Diuel, cause the shippe to haue a contrarie winde, and so take it.

                     MAydeygastar is an Ilande standing towardes the midday, distaunt from Discorsia about a thousande myles. This Ilande is gouerned by foure Moores, and hath in compasse a thousand four hundred myles. Here is greate trade of Merchaundise for Elephantes téeth, for that there is great plentie: they eate no other flesh in this Iland but of Elephants, and of Cammels. Here be many mountaines of redde Sandalos or Saunders trées, also there is founde greate plentie of Amber. Here is good hunting of wilde beasts, and hauking of foules, and hither come many shippes with Merchaundise. Also there is very great plentie of wilde Boares. There was sente from hence vnto the greate Cane the Iawe of a wilde Boare which wayghed twentie fiue poundes. In some times of the yeare, there is founde in this Ilande a certaine foule named Nichas, which is so big, that the quill of his wings is of twelue paces long, and he is of suche bignesse and strength, that he with his talents taketh an Elephante, and carrieth him vp into the ayre, and so killeth him, and the Elephant so being dead, he letteth him fal, and leapeth vpon him, and so féedeth at his pleasure.

                     TAnguybar is an Ilande of great nobility, being tenne thousand myles in compasse, and the people of this countrey are Idolatours, and so bigge and grosse, that they séeme like Giants One of them wil bear a burthen as waightie as sixe of our men may beare. They are all black, and go naked without any couer. These men are fearefull to beholde, hauing greate mouthes, and a great redde nose, great eares, and bygge eyes, horrible in sight. The women are filthy and euil fauoured. There is great trade of Merchandise. These people are bigge of their bodies, strong, and great fighters, and estéeme not their liues. The wilde beastes of thys Iland differ much from other wilde beastes of other Ilāds and countries.

                  YOu shall vnderstande that all whyche I haue declared of India, is only of the noble and great prouinces bordering vppon the sea coastes, and I doe beléeue that there was neuer man, Christian, nor Iew, nor Paynim, that hath séene so much of the leuaunt parties as I Marcus paulus haue séene, for I haue séene India bothe the greate and the lesse, & Tartaria, wyth other prouinces & Ilands, which are so many, yt the age of one man, yea peraduenture of ij. men, would not suffice to

                  IN India the greate, there is a greate prouince named Abashia, whych is to say the middle India, for it standeth betwéene India the greate, and India the lesse. The king of the prouince is a Christian, and the Christians that be vnder hym carrye two tokens made with a burning yron, from the forheade vnto the pointe of their nose. The great King dwelleth in the middest of the prouince, the Moores dwel towardes the prouince of Cadamy.
               
               The holye Apostle Saint Thomas did conuerte muche people vnto the Christian faith in this prouince, and afterwards went from thence vnto the prouince of Moaber, where he was martyred. In this prouince there be many valiant knights, and mē of armes, and they do euer make war against the Souldan of Aden. The people of thys countrey liue vpon fleshe, milke, and Rice, and of no other thing. There they vse muche vsurie, and in this prouince there be many Cities and townes.

There be in this prouince Ports and Hauens, whither many shippes come with merchaundize, and the moste of this prouince liue vppon Rice, for that they haue little fleshe, and lesse milke. This country is very dry and without fruite, and there groweth no grasse, and therefore the beastes of this prouince liue vppon drie fishe, salte and rawe, which they doe eate in steade of strawe and barley.

These people do worshippe the same Idoll that the Tartarians doe worshippe, whiche they name Nazigay. This prouince hathe plaines

Here bée manye Camelles and other beastes, but they are deade. Vppon the Seigniorie of this Kyng there is a Countrey so strong, that no manne maye enter into it, nor yet beaste being bigge, by reason of the straites, lakes, and fountaynes whyche bée there, and for that alwayes there is suche feruent colde, that it is alwayes frozen, and vnto them there can come no shipping. This Countrey is in compasse twelue dayes iorney.

                  I Will declare vnto you howe in these twelue dayes iourney they doe buy the wilde beasts for to haue theyr skinnes. In euerye place of these twelue dayes iourney there is plentie of habitations, and there be masties or dogges little lesse than Asses. These masties doe drawe after them a certaine thing made of Woodde, whiche is called Slioiala, whiche is a sleade, as the Oxen or Horses doe drawe a Carte, sauing it hathe no whéeles as oure Cartes haue, and these Slyoialas or sleddes, are as bigge as twoo menne maye be in it, that is to saye, the Mayster of the maysties or carte, and the Merchaunt that goeth to buy the skinnes. And these masties cease not drawing, excepte it be in some myry place, they sette foure

or sixe masties to drawe, as among vs wée doe sette Oxen or Horses, & when they do come to their iourneys end, the Merchaunt hyreth an other carter with his slead and masties, for that the firste coulde not endure so muche labor, and so he maketh his twelue dayes iourney, till he come to the mountains where the Armins and skinnes are sold, where they buy them, and afterwa

                  des they retourne as they came. At the ende of this Countrey there standeth a Kingdome whiche is named the Barkland, for it is there euer darke, as wee call the Twylight,A darke land for the Sunne shyneth not there, and is not séene. The people of this Countrey haue no King, but liue as beastes without lawe. In this Countrie the men and women are well made of their bodies, although they be somewhat yellowe of coloure. The Tartarians that border vppon them, doe spoyle them very muche, and when the Tartarians doe goe to robbe in that darke valley, they ride vppon mares that haue horse or mare coltes following them, for they doubte to come oute that wayes that they were in, by reason of the darknesse and wooddes, and when they come neare vnto the place where they meane to robbe, they doe tye their horse or mare coltes vnto the trées, and ride vppon the mare, and doe their feate, and as they haue done it, they lette their mares goe whither they liste, and the mares goe straighte vnto their horse or mare coltes, where they lefte them tyed vnto the trées. Those in that Countrie, wyth certaine deuises doe take many Armines, and diuers other wilde beasts, and take the skinnes and dresse them, & make merchaundize. This obscure and darke Coun

There be very fayre menne and women, and vnto no man they giue tribute, sauing vnto the King of Tartarie of the Occident. There is made greate merchaundize of noble furres for apparell. In Rouseland there be founde many mines of siluer, also there is such feruent colde, that the people can scarce liue. This prouince reacheth vnto the Occean Seas towardes the Septentrion, in which Seas there be many Ilandes wherein bréedeth many Gerfaulcons, and singular Hawkes.

               FOr that this treatise which I found in the secōd Booke towards the end, that Maister Pogio Florētine, Secretary vnto Pope Eugenius the fourth wryteth of the varietie or chaunge of fortune, it maketh muche vnto the confirmation and proofe of the things that Maister Marcus Paulus writeth in h
                  •
               s Booke, for that by the mouth of two or three (as our Redeemer sayth) there is proued the truth I thoughte good to translate it out of Eloquent Latine, whiche hee did write it in, and to communicate it into my rude Castilian and naturall tongue, for that ioyntly suche twoo witnesses in thys present worke may make a full, or almoste a sure proofe of some things, for that it hath not bin seene in our Europa, or that in any auntient writing appeareth, it may be thoughte harde or difficile credence. And the saide Pogio followeth in this manner, in the ende of his seconde Booke.
            
               
                  IT séemeth not vnto me a thing straunge from reason, if I decline from the stile that hitherto I haue vsed in this Booke, declaring of the harde fortune making an ende, counting the diuersities of thinges, wherein the heartes of the Readers finde more taste, and amiable gladnesse, than in those that already I haue written. Notwithstanding that also in the cause I will declare, appeareth plainelye the force of Fortune, in retourning a man vnto Italy oute of the extreame partes of the worlde of the Orient, after that he had suffered and passed fiue and twentie yeres such greate fortunes, aswell by sea as by lande. The olde Authors do write many things of the Indians with the common

fame, of the whiche the certaine knowlege that since we haue hadde, sheweth them to be rather fables than of truth, as it appeareth by the referring of one Nicholas a Venetian, that after he had trauailed the intrailes of the Indias, he came vnto Eugenius the fourth Pope of that name, who then was in Florence, to reconcile himselfe, and to haue pardon, for that comming oute of India, and ne
                     •
                  re vnto Egipt towards the redde Sea, hée was constrayned to renounce and forsake the faith, for feare of death, more of his wife and children, than of hymselfe. And for that I hearde by manye, that he declared of manye singular things, I desired muche to heare hym, and not onelye to demaunde of him concerning the things whiche hée hadde séene, in the presence of wise Barons, and of greate authoritie, but also to enforme my selfe wyth hym in myne owne house, and to take a note of his relation, for that there mighte remaine a remembraunce of it vnto those that hereafter shoulde come after mée. And of a trueth hée tolde so certaynelye, so wisely, and so attentiuely all hys trauaile made amongest people of so farre Countries, the vse, manners, and custome of the Indians, the diuersitie of wilde beastes, trées, the lynages of Spices, and in what place it groweth, that it appeared well, hée dydde not declare a fained tale, but the trueth of that whiche hée hadde séene. And as it séemeth, this man went so farre, as none of the olde tyme hadde béene, for he passed the riuer Gangy, and wente beyonde the Ilande Taprobana, where we reade there came none, excepte one Captaine of Alexanders fléete named Onesycrito, and a Citizen of Rome, that by fortune of tēpest arriued in those parties in the time of Tiberius Cesar. This Nicholas Venetian being yong, was as a Merchaunt in the Citie of Damasco in Syria, and hauing learned the Arabian tongue, he departed from the sayde Citie in the company of .600. Merchantes, the whiche company they do call Carouana,
                  
or Carauana, & trauailing with his merchaundize through the deserts of Arabia, otherwise named Petrea, and from thence thoroughe Chaldie, he came vnto the greate riuer Euphrates.
               
               Hée saide, that at the going out of the Deserte, hée sawe a meruailous thing, that aboute midnighte, being all at reste, he heard a great noise and sound, that they thoughte it hadde bin companies of Alarabes wild naked menne, or robbers, and that they were comming to doe them some hurte, and all the whole company arose and were al ready with the feare, and they sawe manye battels of horsemen whiche passed harde by their tents much like an hoste, dooing vnto them no hurte at all, and those that hadde vsed that way, said it was certaine companies of fiends which did ouer run in that sorte the Deserts.
               There standeth aboue Euphrates a noble Citie that the walles of it be of fouretéene thousande paces. And this Citie was a parte of the olde Babilon, and those of that Countrie, name it by a newe name Baldachia, and Euphrates runneth in the middes of it, and they doe passe ouer a bridge that hath fourtéene arches of ech side, where appeareth many remembraunces of the olde Babilon, and manye edifications throwne downe. It hath a strong and a greate Pallaice royall standing vpon a mountaine. The King of this prouince is of a mightie power. From hence vp the riuer twentie dayes sayling, he sawe manye noble and populous, and earable groundes of Ilandes, and so he trauailed eight dayes iourney by lande vnto the Cittie Balsera, and from thence in foure dayes he came vnto the Sea of Persia, whiche ebbeth and floweth as ours doeth, and so there saylyng fyue dayes, he arryued at a Hauen called Chalcou, and from thence hée wente vnto an Iland named Omersia, whych is a small Iland, & distant from the firme lād about .12000 paces, & frō thēce he passed toward

                  India a hundred myles, and came vnto a Citie named Calabatia, which is a noble Citie of the Persians, where merchaunts vse to traffique, and here he was a certaine time, and learned the Persian tongue, and made him apparell as the Persians had, and so he passed from thence forward al his time and trauell. And here he tooke shipping in a shippe with company of the Persians, and of the Moores, & among them they kéepe muche their promise, lawes, and othes made in company, and so sayling a moneth, he came vnto a noble Citie named Cambayta, situated at the second entraunce that the riuer of India maketh in the lande. In this Countrie there is founde the pretious stones whiche are called Sardins or Sardonicas: and here when the husband dieth, they do burne his wife or wiues that he hath, with his body, and she that he most loued, layeth hir neck vppon hir husbandes arme, and in this wise being in hir husbandes armes, they burne them: and the other wiues they burne in an other fire whiche is made for that purpose, and of this vse it shall be rehearsed hereafter. And passing on twentie dayes iourney, he founde two Cities, the one named Pacamunria, and the other Hely. In this Countrey there groweth Ginger whiche is called in that countrie Bellyedy, Gebelly, and Belly, and it is the roote of trées of two cubites in height, the leaues are great, and after the fashion of a kettle, ye bark is hard like ye barke of Canes, & it couereth his fruit: out of it procéedeth the ginger, which mingled with ashes, & layd against the Sun, it drieth in thrée dayes. From hence he went trauailing frō the sea coaste thrée hundreth myles, and he came vnto the greate Citie named Berengalia whych, is in compasse thrée score myles, being enuironed on the one side with harde and highe rockes, and on the other side towards the valleys and playne grounde with strong adarnes and boughes. They saye héere is .900000. menne that may weare armoure. The men of that country take

as manye wiues as they lifte, and are burnte with them when they dye. In this their King hath ouer them greate vantage, for he taketh twelue thousād wiues, and of these there goeth on foote after him wheresoeuer he goeth foure thousande, whych do only prepare and dresse his victuals: and there rideth foure thousand on horsebacke, well apparelled, and of more estimation than the firste. The other foure thousand ryde in carts and wagons, and of these at the leaste there be two thousand or thrée thousand of them that he taketh with condition, that when the king is dead, they of their owne frée willes muste be burnte wyth him: vnto these they do great seruice and obedience. This king hath another very noble Citie, which hath ten thousande paces in compasse, being eight dayes iourney from Berengalia, from whence in twentie dayes iourney by lande, hée came vnto a Citie vppon the sea coste, with a good hauen called Pedifetaman, and in these twentie dayes iourney hée went through two Cities, the one named Odes Chyria, and the other Conteri Chyrian, where there groweth the redde Sandolos or Saunders. From hence he passed vnto a Citie named Malpurya, whiche standeth beyonde the seconde entring, that the riuer India maketh in ye end, wher the body of Saint Thomas the Apostle lyeth honourably in a fayre and famous Church, where he is greatlye honoured and worshipped by the Heretickes Nestorians: and there liue almost a thousande men of them in this Citie. These doe liue throughout all India scattered as the Iewes doe among vs. All this prouince is named Mahabaria, beyonde there standeth a Citie named Cayla, where there be plenty of peares, and many trées that beare no fruite, of sixe Cubits high, and as muche in compasse: the leaues of these trées are so thinne, that being playted or foulded vp, you may put one of them in the palme of your hand. They doe vse these leaues in steade of Paper to write vpon, and for to couer their heades with when it rayneth, for one leafe

will couer thrée or foure men, when they doe trauell. In the middest of this sea there standeth a noble Ilande named Zaylan, whyche is thrée thousande myles in compasse, where there be many precious stones, as Rubies, Saphires, Granates, and those that are named Cattes eyes, whyche are muche estéemed there. Also there is plentye of Synamon, whiche is a trée muche like vnto oures of the greatest Hawtho
                     ••
                  es, sauing that the braunches runne not vpwarde, but open and streight slopewise: the leaues be muche like vnto our Bay leaues, sauing that those of ye Synamon are bigger: the rine or barke of the braunches is best and thinnest, and the rine of the bodye and roote is thickest, and of lesse taste: the fruite is like vnto the Baye berries, out of whych there commeth a very swéete Oyle, and the people vse to make oyntment of it, wherewith the Indians do annoint themselues: they burne the wood of the trée, when the rine is taken away. There is in this countrey a lake, and in the middest of it standeth a royall Citie of thrée myles compasse. The Lords of this Iland are of the lynage of the Bragmanos, and are taken to be of more witte than the others. The Bragmanos Studie Phylosophy all their life, and also Astrologie, and liue honestly. From hence he passed vnto the famous Ilande named Taprobana, which the Indians, call Scyamucera, where is a noble Citie, and there he was a twelue month: it is sixe myles in compasse, and is a famous Citie, hauing greate trade of Merchaundise there, and in al that Iland. From hence be sayled with a prosperous winde, leauing on the right hand the Iland Adamania, which is as much to say, as the Ilande of Colde, whyche is 800. myles compasse, wherein the Euitrofagitas doe liue, and no straungers goe thyther, except it be for necessity of weather, and immediately those barbarous people hewe them in péeces, and eate them. He sayde that Taprobana is 1600000. paces in compasse, the men are verye cruell, and of stubberne conditions,

and the men and women haue very bigge eares, laden with Hoopes of golde, and with precious stones. They do weare linnen and cloth of silke or cruell downe vnto their knées: they take many wiues: their houses are lowe, by reason of the greate heate that the sunne hath there. They are Idolatours, and haue muche Pepper named the greatest, and of the long Pepper, and greate plentie of Camphore and golde. The trée that maketh the pepper is like the Yedra, or Iuie trée, the berries are gréen lyke vnto the Iuniper berries, and redde, and being mingled wyth ashes, they harden with the sunne: there is a gréene fruite named Durians, of the bignesse of Cucumbers. And there be some of them lyke Orengies or Lemans, of diuerse sauours and taste, as like butter, lyke milke, and like curdes. In that part of this lande, whiche is named Bateth, ye 
                  Antropophagos dwel, and haue continuall warre with their neyghbours, and eate the fleshe of their enimies that they doe take, and kéepe their heades for treasure, and vse them in steade of money, when they do buy anye thing, in giuing moste heades for the thing that is most worth, and he that hath moste heades of the deade men in his kéeping, is estéemed to be most rich.
               Hauing the Iland Taprobana, and sayling fiftéene days, he arriued by tempest of weather, vnto the entring of a riuer called Tenaserim, and in this region there be manye Elephants, and there groweth much Brasill. And goyng from thence trauelling many dayes iourney by land, and by sea, he entred at the mouth of the Ryuer Gangey, and sayled fiftéene dayes vp the riuer, and came vnto a Citie named Cernomen, very noble and plentiful.
               Thys Riuer Gangey is of suche breadth, that Saylyng in the middest, you shall sée no lande on neyther side, and hée affyrmeth that it is in some places fiftéene myles in breadth. In the armes and braunches of this ryuer there be Canes of suche a maruellous lēgth,

and so bigge, that scarce a manne maye compasse one of them wyth both his armes: and of the hollownesse or pith of them, they do make things to fishe with, and of ye wood which is more than a spanne thick, they do make boates to trauell with vpon the riuer, and from knot to knotte of these Canes it hath of hollownesse the length of a man. There be in this riuer certaine beasts, hauing four féete, named Crocodiles, which liue in the day time vpon the lād, and in the night in water: and there be many kindes of fishe whiche are not founde among vs, and vppon the braunches of this riuer be manye fayre Gardens, habitations, and delectable grounde. On eche side there groweth a kinde of fruite muche like vnto a figge, whych is named Musa, and it is verye pleasaunte, and more swéete than honnye. Also there is another fruite, whyche we call Nuttes of India, and manye other diuerse fruites. Going from hence vppe the ryuer thrée moneths, leauing behinde him foure famous Cities, he came to a goodlye famous Citie named Maarazia, where there is great plenty of the trées called Alloes, and plentie of golde, and siluer, Pearles, and precious stones. And going from hence he directed hys waye vnto the mountaines of the Orient, for to haue Carbuncles, and trauelling thirtéene dayes, he returned firste to Cermon and afterwardes vnto Buffetanya.
               
               And after that, sayling a whole moneth by sea, he came vnto the entring of the riuer Nican, and sayling vppon it sixe dayes, he came vnto the Citie also named Nican, and he went from thence seauentéene dayes iourney throughe deserte mountaynes, and plaine countrey, the fiftéene days of plaine countrey, vntil he came to a riuer greater than the riuer Gange, which the people of that countrey cal Claua, and sayling vp this riuer a month, he came vnto a famous great Citie called Aua, being 15. miles in compa

They haue greate plenty of Elephantes, for their Kyng dothe kéepe tenne thousande of them for the warres▪ and setteth vpon euery Elephantes backe a Castell, whyche maye carrie eyghte or tenne men with Speares and Shields, or Bowes, or Crossebowes. He rehearsed that they toke the Elephantes in this manner, Plinie agreeth vnto the like. They let the tame Elephants females goe vnto the mountaynes, vntill suche time as the wilde bee acquainted with them, for the male commonly doth content himselfe with one female, and when they haue once acquaintance, the female bringeth the wild, by little and little, grasing, vnto a small yard strongly walled, hauyng two dores, one to come in at, and another to goe out at. The female when she is in at the first gate, she goeth out at the seconde, and the male following hir, the two dores be locked againste him, and then hauing him within, by certayne loupe holes made for the purpose, there commeth in to the number of a thousand men, euery one with his snare in his hande, and one of those men presenteth himselfe before the Elephant, which runneth, thinking to kill the man, and then all those men runne vnto the Elephant, fastning those snares on his féete, and whē they be fastned, with great diligence, they do tye the snares vnto a great post, which is set there for that purpose, and they let him alone so thrée or four dayes, till he be more feeble, and after the space of fiftéene dayes, they giue him a little grasse, in the whiche time he wareth tame, and then they do tye him among other tame Elephants, and carrie him aboute the Citie, and in tenne dayes he becommeth as gentle as one of the others. Also he sayde, they did tame them in this other wise, that they had and dra

                  e them vnto a valley compassed round about, where they did put vnto them the females that were tame, and being somewhat féeble with hunger, they draue them into strayter places made for the nonce, where they be made tame,

and these the Kings do buy for their owne vse. Some are fedde with Rice, and Butter, and some with grasse. The wilde Elephantes féede vpon grasse, and vpon the trées of the fields. He that hathe charge of them, rul
                     •
                  th them with a rodde of yron, or a ring whiche he putteth round about his head. The Elephants haue so much prouidence, that manye with their féete, pull away the Speares from their enimies, for that they shoulde not hurt those that be vpon their backes. The King rideth vpon a white Elephant, which hath a chayne of golde about his necke, being long vnto his féete, set full of many precious stones. The men of this Countrey haue but one wife a péece. Both men and women of this Countrey pricke themselues, making diuers markes, and of diuers couloures, on theyr bodyes. They be all Idolaters, and assoone as they do rise in the morning, they looke into the Orient, holding their hāds togither, and worship. There is in that Countrey a certayne kinde of fruite, like vnto the Orenge, whiche they doe call Cyeno, full of iuice and swéetenesse. Also, there is a trée whiche they doe call Tall, whereon they do write, for in all India, except it bée in the Citie of Combahita, they doe vse no paper, and it beareth a fruite like vnto the Turnep, but they are greate and tender like vnto Gelly. It is pleasant in eating, but the ryne is more pleasant. There be in that Countrey daungerous Serpents, of sixe cubites in length, and as thicke as a man, hauing no féete. The people of that Country haue great delight in eating of those Serpēts rosted. Also they do eate a certayne redde Ante as bigge as a crabbe, estéeming it much drest with Pepper. Also, there is a certaine Beast, hauing a head like vnto a Hogge, the tayle lyke vnto an Oxe, and a horne in his forehead, like vnto a Vnicorne, but smaller by a cubite. He is couloure and bignesse like vnto the Elephante. He is an enimie to the Elephant. The vtter part of his hornes is good for medicines

against poyson, and for this cause he is had in great price and estimation. At the end of this Region towards Catay, there be Oren both blacke and white, had in great estimation. They haue a mane and a tayle lyke vnto a Horse, but more hearie, and reacheth vnto their féete. The heares of their tailes be very fine, and like vnto feathers, and they be sold by weight, and therof they do make Moscaderos or Table clothes, for the Altares of their Gods, or for to couer the Table of their King, or for to trimme them with gold and siluer, to couer ye buttocks or breasts of their Horses, for beautyfulnesse, & they estéeme thē for principall ornaments. Also, the Knightes hang of these heares fast by the yron of their Speares, in token among them of singular nobilite.
               Beyond the sayde Marcino, there is another Prouince more principall than the others, which is named Cataya,
                  
                     Cataya.
                   and he is Lord of it that is named the great Cane, whych is as muche to saye in their tong, as Emperoure,
                     The great Cane.
                   and the City royall, which is .28. miles in compasse, four square, is named Cymbalechya. There standeth in the middest thereof, a very faire and strong Pallace, that serueth for the King. At euery corner standeth a round fortresse of .4. miles compasse, whiche serue for houses of all manner of armoure, and necessarie engines for the warre, and combat against any Citie. And from the Pallace royall there runneth a wall with arches vnto euery one of these fortresses, whereon the King may go vnto any of them, if in case they would rise against him in the Citie. From thys Citie fiftéene dayes iourney, there standeth another Citie newly edifyed by the great Cane, and is named Nentay. It is in compasse thirtie miles, and is most populous of all the rest. And this Nicholas affirmeth, that the houses and Pallaces, and all other policies of these two Cities, séemed much like vnto those of Italy, the men béeing modest and curteous, and of more riches thā the other be.
               
                  Going from Aua vpon a small riuer seauentene dayes iourney, he came vnto a Hauen Citie, being very greate, named Zeitano, and from thence he entred into another Riuer: and in tenne dayes, he came vnto another greate and populous Citie, whiche is in comapasse .12000. paces, whiche is called Paconya, where he remayned foure monethes. In this Citie he founde Vines though they were few, for all India lacketh Vines and Wine, nor they make no wine of the Grapes. This Grape groweth among the trées, and after the Grape is cut, the first thing of all, if they do not sacrifice with it vnto their Gods, it is by and by auoyded out of their sight. Also, there be in this Countrey Pines, Aberrycocks, Chestnuttes, and Mellons, although they be small and gréene. Héere is whyte Sandales or Saunders, and Camphora, or Camphire.
               There is in India farre within, almost at the furthest end of the world, two Ilandes, and both of them are named Laua, the one is of two miles in length, and the other of thrée, towards the Orient, and they are knowen in the name, for the one is called the greate, and the other the lesse. And turning vnto the Sea, he went vnto them, béeing distant from the mayne land a monethes sayling, and the one is a hundred miles distāt from the other. He was in these with his wife and children nine moneths, for in all his pilgrimage he had them euer with him. The dwellers in these Ilands are the most cruell and vncharitable people in the world. They eate Rattes, Cattes, Dogges, and other viler beastes. They estéeme it nothing to kill a man, and he that doth any crime, hathe no penaltie, and the debters be giuen to be as slaues vnto the creditors, and some debters will rather dye than serue, and take a Sword, and kill those that are weaker than they, till they find one that is of more strength than themselfe, who killeth them, & then they carrie the creditor of that murtherer before the Iudge, and cause him to

pay the debtes of the debler. If any of them do buy a new Sword or knife, he proueth it vpon the body of the firste that he méeteth, and there is no penaltie for it. Those that come by looke vpon the wound, and prayse the hardinesse of him that did it, if it be a great wound. They take as many wiues as they list. They do vse much the game of Cockfighting, and they that bring them as well as the lokers on, lay wagers whiche Cocke shall ouercome, and winne the game. In Laua the great, there is a Fowle like vnto a Doue, which hath no féete, his feathers light, and a long tayle: he resteth alwayes on the trées, hys flesh is not eaten, the skinne and tayle are estéemed, for they do vse to weare them on their heads.
               Sayling fiftéene dayes beyond these two Ilandes towards the Orient, you come vnto two other Ilands, the one is named Sanday, where there is Nutmegges and Almaxiga or Masticke. The other is called Bandan, where Cloues grow, and from thence it is caryed vnto the Ilands named Clauas. In Bandan there be thrée kinds of Popiniayes or Parrets, with redde feathers, and yellowe billes, and others of diuers couloures, whiche are called Noros, that is to say, cleare. They are as bigge as doues. There be other white ones as bigge as Hennes, named Cachos, that is to say, better, for they excéede the others, and they speake like men, in so muche, that they doe aunswere vnto the things that they are asked of. The people of these two Ilandes are blacke, by reason of the greate heate. Beyond these Ilands there is a mayne Sea, but the contrary winds will not suffer men to trauell on it.
               Leauing these sayde Ilands, and hauing done his Merchandise, he toke his waye towards the Occidente or Weste, and came vnto a Citie named Cyampa, hauing abundaunce of Aloes and of Camphora, or Camphire, and of golde, and in so muche time as he came hither, whiche was a moneth, he came vnto a Citie named

                  Coloen, whiche is a noble Citie of thrée miles compasse, where there is Ginger named Conbobo, and Pepper, and Vergino, and Sinamon, which is named Gruessa. Thys Prouince is named Melibarya. Also, there be Serpents of sixe cubites in length, and fearefull to behold, but they do no hurt, except they receyue hurt. They do delight muche to sée children, and for to sée them, they come where men be. Their heads when they be layde, séeme like to Celes heads, and when he lifteth vp his head, it séemeth bigger. It hath at the hinder partes a face like to a man and as though it were paynted of diuers couloures. They doe take them by inchantments, which the people vse muche there, and carrie them to be séene, and doe no hurt to anye body. Also, there is in this Prouince, and in the nexte adioyning named Susynaria, another kind of Serpēts, which hath foure féete, and a long tayle lyke mastyes. They doe take them hunting, and eate them, for they doe no hurte, and are to eate as amongst vs the Hinde or wilde Goate. The people say they are good meate. Their Skinnes be of diuers couloures, and those people vse them for diuers couerings, for it is very fayre to behold. Also, there be other Serpentes of a maruellous figure in that Countrey, of ye length of one cubite, with wings like vnto Battes. They haue seauen heads, ordinarily sette of the length of his bodye. They dwell among the trées, and are of a swifte flighte. The yare more venomous than the other, that onely with their breath they kill a man. Also, there be Cattes of the Mountayne, that flye, for they haue a small skinne from the backe vnto the bellie, ouer all theyr body and féete, whyche is gathered vp when they are still: and when they will flye, they spredde it, and moue it lyke wings, leaping from one trée vnto another. The Hunters do follow them, till they be wéerie with flying, that they fall downe, and so are taken. Also, there is in this Countrey a trée named Cachy, that of the troncheon

there groweth a fruite lyke vnto a Pyne, but it is so great, that a man can scarce beare it. The hull is gréene and harde, but it is of suche a sorte, that if you thrust it with your finger, it gyueth place. It hath within it two hundred and fiftie, or thrée hundred Apples, like vnto Figges. They are of a pleasante tast, and are separated with a very thinne rine. The hull within is like vnto the Chestnut in hardnesse and sauoure, and in like maner they are rosted. They are windie, so that if they be putte into the fire, except they be cut, they will start out. They do giue the vtter rine vnto the Oxen to eate. Sometimes they fynde this fruite vnder grounde in the rootes of the trées, and those be of a pleasanter tast, therefore they doe vse to presente them vnto the Kings and Nobles. The fruite within hath no rine. This trée is muche like vnto a great Figge trée: the leaues are like vnto the leaues of Platanos, or ragged. The wodde is like vnto Bore, therefore it is hadde in estimation, and is vsed aboute manye things. Also, there is another fruite named Amba, verye gréene, like vnto a Walnut, but bigger than a Peache. The rine is bitter, and within, it hath the sauour of hony. They lay them in water before they ripe, and dresse them as we doe the gréene Olyues for to eate.
               From Coloen he wente thrée dayes iourney vnto a Citie named Cochin, it is fiue myles in compasse, scituated at the entring of a Riuer, of the whiche it hath the name, and sayling a certayne time vpon the Riuer: he saw manye fiers and nettes fast by the Riuer, and thought there had bin fishermen, and he demaunded what those fishermen did with those fires euery nighte, and those of that Coūtrey gaue him answere yeepe, yeepe, that is to say, they were fishes or monsters, hauing humane forme, that on the daye time liued in the water, and in the night they doe come out of the water, and gather wodde togither, and make a fyre, striking one stone agaynste

another, whiche Monsters did take and eate fishe, for there woulde come manye vnto the lighte of the fire, and sometimes there is taken some of them, and there is found no difference in them from other men and women. In this Region, the frutes are like vnto those of Col
                        •
                     en. Beyond this, there standeth another Citie named Calonguria, standing at the entring of another Riuer into the Sea, and beyond, there standeth Paluria, and Malyancora, and this name among them signifyeth a great Citie, it is nine miles in compasse. He wente through all those, and came vnto Colychachia, a City standing vpon the Sea coaste, it is eyght miles in compasse, it is the most noble in trade of Merchandise, that is in all India.
               
               There is héere very much Pepper, Laccar, Ginger, grosse Sinamon, and other spices Aromatike, and of a swéete sauoure. Only in this region, the woman taketh as many husbands as she listeth, and the husbands agrée among themselues what eache shall giue towardes the mayntenance of the wife. Euery husband is in his owne house, and when he goeth vnto his wife, he setteth a signe at the dore, and when another of them commeth, and séeth the signe, he goeth another way. The children are the husbands that the wife listeth to giue them vnto. The sonne dothe not inherit his fathers lande, but hys sonnes sonne.
               From hence he trauelled 
                     •
                  iftéene dayes, tyll hée came to a Citie called Cambayta, standing néere the Sea. It is twelue miles in compasse towardes the Occidente. There is plentye of Espico, Nardo, or Lacca Indico, or Gome Laka, Myrabolanos, & Crewill.
               There is héere a certayne kind of Priestes, whiche are named Bachales, hauing but one wife a péece, and she (by their law) is burnt with hir husband. This kind of people eateth no flesh, but onely fruites of the grounde, and Rice, milke and hearbes.
               
                  Here be many wilde Oxen, they haue manes like vnto Horses, but longer, and his hornes are so long, that when he turneth his heade they reache vnto his tayle, and for that they be so bigge, they doe vse them in steade of bottels to drinke in by the waye. Returning to Colicuchia, hée passed vnto an Iland named Secutera, whiche standeth towards the Occident, distant from the mayne lande a hundreth myles. It is sixe hundreth myles in compasse, and it is replenished for the most parte with Christians Nestorians Heretickes. Right against this Iland no more thā fiue myles, there standeth two Ilands, a thousande myles distant the one from the other, the one is of men, the other of women, sometimes the men passe vnto the women, and sometimes the women go ouer vnto the men, and they returne backe vnto their Ilande before sixe moneths, for if they shoulde tarrie any longer, they thinke shoulde dye.
               From hence he passed by sea, vnto a Citie named Adena in fiue days, which hath many edifications, and from thence in seauen dayes he wente vnto Ethiopia, vnto a hauen named Barbara, and from thence in a monthes sayling he came vnto the redde sea, vnto a hauen called Byonda, and from thence he sayled two monthes with great difficultie, and landed in a countrey neare vnto mounte Sinay, & from thence trauelling through the deserts, he came vnto Carras, a Citie in Egipt with his wife, foure sonnes, and as many seruaunts. In this Citie his wife, two sonnes, and his seruauntes died of the plague, and finallye after long perilous and daungerous pilgrimages, he came vnto Venice, his own countrey.

                  I Demaunding him of the life and customes of the Indians, he gaue me aunsweare that all India was diuided into thrée parts, the one from Persia vnto the riuer Indo, another from the riuer Indo, vnto the riuer Gange, and the other stā
                  deth beyond these, and excéedeth the others in riches, humanitie, and pollicie, and are equal vnto vs in customes, life, and pollicie, for they haue sumptuous and neate houses▪ and all their vessels and housholde stuffe very cleane: they estéeme to liue as noble people, auoyded of all villanie and crueltie, being courteous people & riche Merchauntes, in so muche that there is one merchaunte hauing fortie shippes for his owne trade, and euery one of them is estéemed in 50000. Duckets. These only vse as we do, tables couered with table clothes, and haue theyr Cupboardes of plate, for the other Indians eate vppon a thing layde vppon the grounde. The Indians haue neyther vines nor Wine, they doe make their drinke of grounde Rice mingled with water, putting vnto it a certaine redde coloure all tempered with the iuyce of a certayne trée.
               Also they make their pottage like vnto their Wine. In the Ilande named Taprobana they doe cutte the braunches of a certaine trée, whiche is named Tall, and leaue them hanging, and out of them there runneth a swéete licour whiche they vse to drinke. Also there is a lake betwéene the riuers Indo and Gange, of a maruellous sauerie and pleasaunt water to drinke, and al those that dwell there about drink of it, and also farre off, for they haue set

horse from place to place, 
                     •
                  or the purpose, so that they haue it brought fresh euery daye: they haue all want of breade: they liue vppon Farre or Rice, fleshe, milke, and chéese. They haue gret plentie of Hennes, Capons, Partridges, Feysauntes, and manye other wildefoules. They doe vse much fowling and hunting. They shaue their beardes, and nourishe a Heare tayle: and some tye their haire wyth a silken lace, behinde their shoulders, like a tayle, and so they weare them vnto the warres. They haue Barbars as we haue, they are tall of bodye as we be, and also in their time of life, they doe lye in sumptuous beddes, and couered with quilles of Cotten. Their apparell is diuerse according vnto the diuersitie of the countrey. They haue all scante of woollen cloth, they do vse cloth of lyne and of cruell, and make apparell of it. As well the men as the women couer their secréetes vnto their hammes, with a péece of linnen, & vpon it they put a vesture of linnen, or of silke, for the greate heate will not suffer them to weare more apparell, and therefore they doe goe so single tyed with Crimson lace, and of gold tyed as we do sée the painters make on the auntient pictures. The women vse certaine thinne shoes of leather, trimmed wyth Golde and cruell.
               Also they doe weare for gallauntnesse Hoopes of golde on their armes, and about their neckes, about their breastes, and on their legges, the waight of thrée pounde set with precious stones: the common women kepe theyr houses as baudes: there be manye and easie to finde, for they are almost in euery stréet, the which with perfumes and soft oyntmentes, with their tender age and beautie prouoke muche the menne, for in that countrey they are muche inclyned vnto those women, and for thys cause the Indians knowe not what thyng is that abhominable sinne. Of manye wayes they doe dresse theyr heades, but commonlye moste of them vse to couer their

heades with fine lawnes wrea
                     •
                  hed, and their haire laced with a silken lace: in some other p
                     •
                  aces they binde theyr haire vp to their heades, in manner like vnto a peare, and on the knot aboue on their haire they set a pinn
                     •
                   of golde, whereby they do hang certaine cordes of golde, being of diuerse colours, hanging betwéene the haires. Some women vse commonly blacke haire, and among them it is most estéemed. Some women couer theyr heades wyth certaine painted leaues of trées, and they doe not paynte their faces, but those inhabiting the prouince named Cataya doe.
               In the India within, they do not consent to a man to haue but one wife. In the others they haue as manye as their carnall lust wil, sauing the Christian Hereticke N
                     •
                  
                  storians, which dwel scattered throughout all the Indias, for they take but one woman. The maner of their tombes is not as one in all the Indias, for the moste India excéedeth other, in diligence and sumptuousnesse, for they doe make caues vnder grounde, in trimming it with a fine wal, and laye in the deade body in a precious bedde, trimmed wyth Ornaments of Golde, setting certaine baskettes round about wyth his moste precious apparell, and put on rings, as though the deade bodye shoulde enioye those things in Hell. They close the mouth of the caue very strongly, that none may enter, and vpon it they do make a sumptuous and rich tombe strong to abide rayne, and to be the more durable: but in the middle India they doe burne the deade bodies, and most commonly they do burne their wiues alyue with the deade body, one or manye, according as hée had.
               They doe by law burn the first wife with him, although it be but one. Also they doe take other wiues on this condition, for to honoure him in death, burning hir selfe with him: and this among them is no little honour. They do laye the deade bodie in a bedde trimmed with the beste

apparell that he hath. They do make a fyre rounde about with swéete wood, and when it burneth, his wife is trunly drest with hir beste aray, and comming with Trumpets and Shawmes and songs merily, as thoughe she did sing, she goeth rounde about the fire. At this there is presente the Prieste, whiche they name Bachale in a Pulpit, preaching vnto hir howe she muste not estéeme the life nor death, saying, that she shall haue in the other worlde with hir husband muche pleasure, and shall possesse greate riches, honour and apparell: she inflamed with those words that he telleth hir, after that she hath gone a certaine time rounde about the fire, shée standeth nigher the Priestes Chayre or Pulpit, and putteth off all hir apparell, & putteth on a white linnen shéete, and leapeth into the fyre. If some of them be fearefull (for they haue séene the lyke of some) that lamenteth and striueth with death, after that she hath leapte in, then the standers by doe throwe hir in wheather shée will or no. After they be burnte, they gather the ashes, and putte them into pottes, and some into the graue.
               ¶ They doe wéepe for the deade after diuers manners. The inner Indians couer theyr heades with a sacke, and some putte boughes of trées in the highe wayes, and doe hang from the toppe to the grounde painted verses, playing thrée daies vpon certain instrumēts of Copper. They do giue vnto the poore for Gods sake. Other do wéep thrée dayes for the deade, and all the kinsfolkes and neighbors goe vnto the deade bodies house, and they doe carry victualles, but it is not dreste in the dead mans house. In these thrée dayes, those that haue buried their father or mother, do carry a bitter leafe in their mouth, and in a whole yere after they doe not chaunge their apparell, nor eate not but once a day, nor yet cutte theyr nailes, nor haire of their heade or bearde. The women which wéepe for the dead, are many, they stande neare vnto the deade bodies bedde,

being naked vnto the nauell, and strike theyr breastes wyth a loude voyce, saying, alacke, alacke: and one of them beginneth to praise vertues of the deade bodye, and all the reste aunswered vnto hir wordes, striking theyr breasts: some put in certaine vessels of gold, and of si
                     •
                  uer. The ashes of their Prince they cause to be cast into a lake that they haue, saying, it is hallowed by their Goddes, and that that waye they goe downe vnto their Gods. The Priestes whyche they doe call Bachales, eate of no kinde of beastes, especially not of the Oxe, for they will neither eate, nor kill him, saying, he is verye profitable vnto menne aboue al beastes. They doe eate Rice, hearbes, fruites, and such like, and haue but one wife, whiche is borne with hir husbande when he dyeth, laying hir armes aboute his necke, receyuing hir death with so so good a wil, that she sheweth no signe of paine. Through out al India there is founde a lynage of Philosophers named Bramanos, whiche studye Astrologie, and prognosticate things to come. They are apparelled more honestly, and liue more holily than the others. Nicholas saide,Men liue three hūdreth yeares. that he hadde séene amongest these men, some of .300 yeares, and among them it was hadde for a miracle, for wheresoeuer that man wente, the boyes woulde followe hym, as a thing of noueltie: and among them is muche vsed the superstition whyche they doe call Geomancia, by the whiche they tell thinges to come, as thoughe they were present. Also they are gyuen vnto inchauntementes, so that dyuers tymes they doe moue and cause t
                     •
                  mpestes to cease, and for this cause manye do eate in secret, for that they should be enchaunted by those that looke vppon them.
               ¶ The saide Nicholas dydde tell for a trueth, that hée béeyng patrone and owner of a Shyppe, hée hadde a calme seauen dayes, and hys marriners fearyng, they wente all vnto the mayne maste, and sette vppe a Table, and

after they had made their sacrifices vppon it, they leapte and daunced rounde aboute, calling manye times the name of their Gods, whyche they name Mutia: and among these there entred a Féend in a Alarabe or Moore, whyche was amongest them, he beganne to sing maruellouslye, running aboute the Shippe lyke a madde man, and afterwardes he came vnto the Table, and dydde eate vppe all the meate vnto the bones and fire. Also hée didde demaunde a Cocke, and killed it, and drunke vp the bloude, and immediatelye hée demaunded of those of the Shippe, what they woulde haue that hée shoulde doe, and they demaunded that he shoulde gyue them wind, he promised to giue it them within thrée dayes, and suche, that they shoulde come vnto harborowe: and he shewed, setting his handes behinde, from whence the wind should come, and willed them to prepare for the strength that the winde woulde bring: and when he hadde thus saide, the manne fell downe as halfe deade, without anye knowlege or remembraunce of anye thing that he hadde saide, and in fewe dayes after they were sette in harborowe. Commonly the Indians sayle by the guiding of the Starres of the Pole Antartique, for seldome times they doe sée oure North Starre. They vse not the Loademans stone as wée doe: they doe measure their waye, and distaunce of places, according as their Poale riseth and falleth, and so they doe knowe by this meanes, what place they are in.Their Pole riseth and falleth. They doe make bigger Shippes than wée doe, that is to saye, of twoo thousande Tunnes, wyth fyue sayles, and so manye mastes: they builde their Shippes wyth thrée plancke
                     •
                   one vppon another vnder water, that they maye the better resiste the tempestes, for there chaunceth many. These Shippes are made with Chambers, after suche a sorte, that if one of them shoulde breake, the others maye goe and finish the voyage. Throughout al India they doe worshippe Idolles, and haue Churches

muche like vnto oures, painted within with diuers pictures, whiche they doe decke with floures at their feasts. They haue within Idolles of stone, and gold, of siluer, and of Iuorie, some of .60. foote in height. They haue among themselues diuers manners in worshipping, and sacrifizing. When they enter into the Church, they wash themselues in cleane water, and so they go in the morning, and in the afternoone, they go in lying along vpon the ground, lifting vppe their féete and handes, and so praye a whyle, then they doe kisse the grounde, and sense their Idolles with the smoake of swéete woodde. On this side of Gange the Indians vse no belles, but in steade of them, they doe strike vppon a vessell of Copper, and with an other vessel they doe offer victualles vnto their Gods as the Gentiles did, and afterwarde doe imparte it to the poore, that they maye eate it.
               ¶ In the Cittie whiche they name Cambayta the Priestes preache vnto the people in presence of the Idoll their God, declaring howe they shoulde worshippe him, & howe much it pleaseth their Gods, when they do kill themselues for their loue: and there stande in presence many that determine to kill themselues for them. They haue a hoope of Iron aboute their neckes, the vtter parte of the hoope is rounde, and within, it is sharpe like vnto a Rasar: also they doe hang vnto the fore parte of the hoope down theyr breaste a chaine, and being sette downe, they fasten theyr féete vnto it, and béeyng thus, as the Prieste sayeth certaine wordes, they stretch forth their legges; and lifte vp their heades, and thus with the sharpenesse of the hoope, cutte off their heades in sacrifice of their Idoll, yéelding vppe their liues. And they that kill themselues in this order, are estéemed as Saints. In the Citie of Bizenegalia in certaine time of the yeare, they doe carry about the Cittie in procession their Idoll betwéene two cartes, in the company

of muche people, and the Damoysellesride in cartes in trimme aray, singing in the praise of hym with muche solempnitie, and manye induced by the strength of theyr faith, do lay themselues vpon the ground, that the whéeles of the cartes may goe ouer them, to bruse their bones, and so to dye, saying, that that death is acceptable vnto theyr God. Others there be, that for the better adorning of the carts, make holes throgh the sides of their bodies, putting a rope throughe it, and tye themselues vnto the carte, and so hanging dead in the procession, accompany theyr Idoll, thinking that they cannot doe greater worshippe nor sacrifice vnto their Gods. And they make their solempnity thrée times in a yeare. In one time there gather togither all the menne and women, and people of all ages, washing themselues in the sea, or in a riuer, hauing all newe apparell, doyng nothing else in thrée dayes but feaste, daunce, and sing. Another feaste they celebrate in burning manye lampes within and withoute their Churches, burning with oyle of Ioni
                        •
                     lly, and the light goeth not oute daye nor nighte. In the thirde, they doe sette vppe poales like small mastes through all the stréetes, and from the toppe vnto the grounde, they doe hang very faire clothes, wroughte with golde, belonging vnto their Gods and painted, and on the topped of these poales, al the whole nine dayes that it endureth, they do sette a religious man that hathe a benigne and méeke face, who suffereth all that paine for to receiue the grace of his God, and the people throwe vnto him Orrenges, Lemmons, and other like fruites, and he suffereth it all with patience There bée other thrée solempne dayes, that they doe caste Saffron water vppon those that passe throughe the stréetes, and manye laughe at it. They doe celebrate their weddings wyth banquets, songs, trumpets, and instrumentes muche like vnto ours, sauing Organs whiche they haue not: they doe make very sumptuous feasts day and nighte, with instrumentes,

daunces, and songs. They daunce rounde aboute as wée doe, following one after an other in order, and twoo of them carrying twoo painted wandes in their handes, and as they doe méete, they doe chaunge stickes or wandes. And Nicholas rehearseth, that this was a fayre sighte to beholde. They doe vse no Bathes, sauing the Indians beyonde Gange. The others doe washe themselues manye times of the daye with colde water: they haue scant of oile, and other fruites of ours, as Peaches, Peares, Cherries, Damsons, Apples, and of Grapes they haue but fewe, and (as aboue is rehearsed) onely in one place. And in Puditfetamas, a prouince, there groweth a certaine trée withoute fruite, it groweth thrée cubites aboue grounde, and they call it shamefulnesse, for when a man commeth vnto it, it incloseth the braunches, and when he goeth away, it spreadeth abroade his braunches.
               ¶ Birengalia is a Mountaine whiche standeth beyonde towards the Septentrion fiftéene dayes iorney. It is enuironed with many lakes, named Birenegalias, whiche are full of venomous beastes, and the mountaine standeth daungerous to bée entred, by reason of Serpentes. And thereon growe the Adamantes: and for that menne dare not goe vnto it, the pollicie of manne founde a way to enter, and to take the Adamantes, for there standeth adioyning vnto it an other mountaine, being a little higher, and in certaine times of the yeare menne goe vppe vnto the toppe of it, where they doe kill certaine Oxen that they carrye with them, and the péeces of fleshe being hotte and bloudy, with certaine Crossebowes for the purpose, doe shoote them vppon the toppe of that other mountaine, and with the fall, it cleaueth faste vnto the Adamantes, and then the Bitturs and Eagles that flye in the ayre, snatche vppe that fleshe with their clawes or tallants, and flye vnto other places, where they maye féede vppon it without feare of those Serpentes, and so the men finde

the stones that fall from the fleshe: they doe fynde wyth more ease the pretious stones, for they doe digge in sundrye places, where they vse to finde suche stone, so déepe, til they fynde water mingled wyth grauell, and then they doe take a syne for that purpose, and putte in of the grauell, and the water runneth out, and kéepe the stones that remaine behind, and after this sorte in al these parties they doe vse to finde them: and the Maisters that sette to séeke them, haue greate care that their seruauntes doe not steale of those stones, for they haue those that search all their apparell, yea, and so neare, that they leaue not vnsearched their priuie partes, to knowe if they haue hidden any. They diuide 
                     •
                  he yeare into twelue moneths as we doe, and counte the moneths according to the twelue signes of the Elements. They accompte the yeare in diuers manners, and the moste parte doe recken it from August, for that in the time of Augustus Octauius Caesar there was an vniuersall peace throughoute all the world, and they recken from that time .1490. yeares. In some regions they haue no money, but vse in steade of money a certayne small stone whiche they name Cattes eye, and in some other places they do vse péeces of Iron like néedles, somewhat bigger. In other places they do vse the Kings name written in paper in steade of money. In some prouinces of India more within the lande, they doe vse Venice duckets of golde, and also other mony of two duchettes in one. Also they do vse money of siluer, and of copper, and in other places they doe make certaine péeces of golde, and vse them in steade of money. The firste Indians in the warres vse dartes, & swords, a defence for their armes like Almaine riuets, rounde Targes, and bowes. The other Indians vse skulles, backes, and breaste plates. The Indians which are beyond, vse Crossebowes and gunnes, & al other ingenious artillerie vsed against Cities. These

those of the Weaste frée, and saye, that all other people are blinde, sauing they, whiche haue twoo eyes, and saye that we haue but one, signifying, that in prudence they do excéede all the worlde. And onelye the Cambay

                     as write in paper, and all the reste write vppon leaues of trées, and of them make Bookes of a good liking: nor yet they write not as we doe, nor as the Iewes from one side vnto an other, but begin aboue, and so write downewardes. There be among the Indians diuers languages. They haue gret abundaunce of slaues. The debtor that can not paye, they cause him to serue the creditor, & he that is accused of any crime, there being no certaine witnesse againste him, is quitte by his oth: they vse thrée manner of othes. There commeth the partie before hys Idoll, and sweareth by that Idoll, that he is not faultie, and they haue readye a hotte burnyng Iron like vnto a fishe hooke, and cause hym that swore, to touch it with his tongue, and to licke it, and if it doe him no hurte, he is quitte. And others bring the partie before hys Idoll, and cause hym to take that same burning yron in his hande, and so to carry it certaine paces, and if it hurt him not, he is quitte, but if it doe, he is guiltie. The thirde manner of swearing, whiche is moste vsed. is suche: They doe sette before his Idoll, a potte full of hote melted butter, and he that sweareth not to be guiltie, dippeth in two of his fingers into the butter, and so wrappeth them with a clowte, and sealeth it, that it shall not vnloose, and at thrée dayes ende they vndoe it, and if there be founde any signe of burning, hée is guiltie, if not, he is quytte. There is no pestilence in the Indias, nor yet other of the diseases that vse to trouble oure regions, and for this cause there is more Townes and people than is to be beléeued. There be manye that make hostes of a million of menne, whych is .1000000. Nicholas declared,

that of one to
                     ••
                  e, there went out against another tow
                     ••
                   great hosts, and had battayle, and when the one had ouercome the other, for a great triumph, they did bring twelue Cart loades of gold laces, and of silke, with the whych the men that remayned deade, had tyed theyr locke hayres, that hanged downe vpon their backes. He sayd more, that sometimes he had gone to their wars, only for to sée both parties, and they dyd not hurt hym, for that they knew hé

                   was a straunger.
               In an Iland named Laua the great, is founde in a fewe places a trée, that hath in the middest of the harte a rodd
                     •
                   of yron, very small, but so long as the hart goeth, and hée that hath of this yron next vnto his flesh, shall not perishe by no kinde of yron, and for this cause there be many that cut their skinnes and put a péece of it betwéene the skinne and the flesh, it is much estéemed.
               The things that of the byrde Phoenix be declared and written in verses by Latancio, séeme not to be fables, for the sayde Nicholas doeth say, that at the end of India, there is only one byrde named Seuienda, whose bil is like vnto Alboge, or togither with many hoales, and when the time of his death commeth, he gathereth togither dry woodde into his neste, and sitting vpon it, he singeth so swéetely wyth his bill, that he delighteth and pleaseth muche those that heare him, and then flittering with his wings vppon the wood, there cōmeth fire, and he letteth hymselfe burne, & then there commeth a worme out of his neste, and of hys ashes, and of it bréedeth the birde, vnto the likenesse of that byrdes byl. Those of that country made the Alnogue with the which they play very swéetly. And Nicholas maruelling much of it, they tolde him of what the making of it procéeded. Also there is in the first India, in an Iland called Saylana, a riuer named Arotanie, so full of fishe, that easily they maye take them vp with their handes, but as soone as a manne holdeth one of these fishes in his hande,

there commeth vnto him a Feuar, and letting the fish go, the Feuar is gone from hym, the cause of it appeareth to be the nature of the fish, as among vs there is a fish which we call Torpedo, whych fish if a man do hold in his hand, it will be num, and grieue him: although the Indians saye, that it commeth by meanes of their Goddes, by a certaine tale that they do tell of it.
               AFter, for an information to the reader, kéeping ye truth of the Historie, I did write those things rehearsed, as the sayd Nicholas gaue report, and then there came another out of the high India, which standeth towardes Septentrion, or the North, and he came, sente vnto the Pope for to sée the things and manners of these parties, for in those parties they had fame, that in the Occident or west there was another worlde, being Christians. And this mā declared that neare vnto Cataya there was a kingdome, which indured twentie dayes iourney, the which king and people were Christians, but of the sect of the Nestorians. He declared that the Patriach of the Nestorians had sent him for to bring him tydings certaine from these parties. He rehearsed that they had bigger, & more richer Churches than ours, being al vaulted, and that their Patriarch was very rich in golde and in siluer, that euery father of family did giue yearelye vnto him an ounce of siluer. I communed with this man, by an interpretet whych could the Turkish tong, and the Latin, and I demaunded of him by meanes of this, the wayes, & townes, houses, customs, manners, and of other things that a man delighteth to heare, there was great difficultie to learne it, for lacke of the interpreter, and also of the Indian, but he affirmed the power of the great Cane, or Emperoure of al men, to be greate and mighty, for he had vnder him nyne mighty kings.
               
                  Also he declared that he hadde trauelled many months through the high Scithia, is nowe Tartaria, and throughe Persia, and that finallye he came vnto the riuer Euphrates, from whence he entered into the sea, and sayled vnto Trip

                  e than ours, both in publike edifications, and of Citizens, for he declared to haue séene many cities ten myles, and of twentie myles in compasse. And after that this man had spokē with Eugenius the fourth Pope of that name, he wēt from Florence for to sée Rome in deuotion: he demaunded neyther siluer nor gold, séeming, that he came not for gain, but only to fulfil the message of hym that sent him.
               IN the same time there came vnto the Pope certaine men from Ethiopia, in deuotion of the faith, with whō I had communication, by an interpreter, to knowe if they knew any thing of ye riuer of Nilus, and of his springing. Two of them gaue answere, that they were of a countrey being very neare vnt
                     •
                   two welsprings, from whence the riuer Nilus procéedeth: when I hearde this, I coueted to knowe the things that of this matter the olde auntiente Phylosophers, namely Ptolomes, did write: firste of the fountaines of Nilus. It appeareth not that they knewe it, but only by coniecture, to appeare that they drew out some things of the Originall increase of the sayde riuer. And as these witnesses of sighte, did tell me of these and of others worthy to remayne in memorie, it séemed vnto me verye good to write them.
               They declared that the Riuer Nilus hadde his heade and Welspryng neare vnto the Region Equinoctiall at the foote of verye hyghe mountaynes, whyche are alwayes couered on the toppe with Mistes, from thrée welsprings, two of them standing 40. paces the one from

the other, and in 500. paces they méete, and make the riuer so great, that no man may passe ouer but with boate. The thirde which is the biggest, standeth a thousand paces frō the other two, and he commeth into the riuer of the others, ten myles off. Also they sayde that more than 1000. riuers did enter into Nilus, and it increaseth so muche in those countryes, with the raine of March, April, and May, that it maketh Nilus to swell ouer so muche, that it made wonderfull great floudes. Also they declared that the water of Nilus was verye swéete and sauerie, before he entereth among the other Riuers, and it hath vertue to heale those that haue the leaprie and scabs, if they washe themselues in it. And beyonde the headsprings of Nilus fiftéene dayes iourney, there be verye fruitefull countries, ful of people, and well tilled, hauing very notable Cities, and also sayde that beyonde that countrey there was the sea, but they had not séene it, and that neare vnto the spring of Nilus there was a Citie, wherein they were borne, and it was fiue and twentie myles in compasse, full of people, and in the night had 1000. watches for to defende the Citie from daunger and alterations that might rise. This region is temperate, and delectable, and plentifull of alll thyngs, in so much as 3. times in the yere there springeth new grasse, and twice in the yeare it beareth corne. It hath abundaunce of broade and wine, although the most parte of Ethiopia vse (in steade of wine) barley sodden in water. They haue figges, Peaches, Orenges, and Cucumbers like vnto our Lemmons, Sytrons, and sauing Almonds. They haue al our kinde of fruites▪ Also they named diuers trées that they had, whiche we neuer sawe nor hearde of in our parties, and they are difficult to write, 
                     •
                  or that the interpreter could not altogither vnderstande the Arabian tongue. But of one of those trées, I muste néedes rehearse, whiche is as thicke as a man maye compasse, and as highe as a man. It hath many rynes one

within another, and betwéene those rines hath his fruite like vnto the Chestnut, and being ground, it becommeth meale, and of it they do make pleasant white bread, which they do vse in their bākets. The leafe of this trée is more than a cubit in breadth, and more than two cubits in length. They sayd also, that towardes the Ilande Meroe, the Nilus coulde not be sayled, by reason of the number of Rockes that were there, and that from Meroe vnto Egipt, it was naui
                     •
                  able, but they tarrie sixe moneths in the Nauigation, for that the riuer giueth manye turnes. Those that dwell in that Countrey, haue the face of the Sunne towardes the North, as we haue it towardes the South, and in March they haue it right ouer their heads. All Ethiopia hath one manner of letters, although they haue diuers languages, according vnto the greatnesse of the prouinces. Some of them that dwell in the regions towards the Sea coast, and in the hart of the India, there was very much Ginger, Cloues, Nutmegs, and Suger. Betwéene Ethiopia and Egipt there be desertes of .50. dayes iourney, and they trauell so farre, hauing with them prouision of meate and drinke vpon Cammels. It hath dangerous passages in many places, by reason of the wilde men that go naked in those deserts, like wild beastes riding vppon Cammels, whose flesh and milke they do eate. They doe robbe the Cammels and prouision that the trauellers carie, so that many dye for hunger, and for this cause there passe fewe that way vnto vs. The Ethiopians most commonly are of longer life than we, for many liue vntil .120. yeares, and .150. yeares, and in some places they liue tyll 200. yeares. It is a Countrey much inhabited, and neuer hath the plage, nor other infirmities, so with this, & with their long liues, their multitude is much encreased. They haue diuers customes, according to the diuersitie of the Countrey. They haue no wooll, but weare linnen and silk both men and women. And in some places, the women

weare long traines, and a girdle of a spanne breade, trimmed with gold and precious stones. Some of them weare vpon their heads a Lawne, weaued with gold: and some weare their heare loose: and some wound vp in a lace hanging downe at their backes. They haue more plentye of gold and precious stones than we. The men vse to weare rings, and the women braselets wrought of gold and precious stones. From Christmas vnto Lent they feast euerie day, eating and daunsing. They do vse little Tables, so that two or thrée may sitte at one of them, and do couer them with table clothes as we do. They haue but one King, whiche is entituled King of Kings, after or vnder God, and they saye, he hath many Kings vnder him, and that they haue diuers kinds of beastes. The Oxen are crooke backed, like vnto Camels, with hornes of thrée cubites in length bending vpon their backes, so that vppon one of their hornes they do carrie a Rundlet of wine. Their dogges are of the bignesse of our Asses, and there is some of them that may do more than a Lion, and hunt with them. They haue very great Elephants, and bring vp some of them for their pleasure & for hostilitie, & some for the warres. They bring them vp of yong ones, & tame them, and then kill the old. Their téeth are of sixe cubites in length. Also, they do tame and bring vp Lions, and to shew them for a magnificēce and ostentation. Also, there is a kind of beastes of diuers couloures like vnto the Elephant, but they haue not suche a tronke and snoute, they do call him Belus. They haue féete like vnto a Camell, and two very sharp hornes, each of a cubit in length, the one standeth in his forehead, and the other vpon his nose. Also, there is another beast somewhat lōger thā a Hare, but in all proportions like, whiche they name Zebet, and hath such a strong smell, that if at any time he rubbe himselfe againste any small trée, he leaueth behinde hym such a swéete sauour, that those that trauell and smell it,

                   Also they reported, that there is another kinde of Beast, of nine cubits in length, and sixe foote in height, hauyng clouen féete like vnto an Oxe. Their body is a cubit in compasse, and much like in haire vnto the Libard, headed like vnto a Camell, and hathe a necke of four cubites in length. His tayle is very thicke, and muche estéemed, for the women do worke with it, emb

                  odering it with precious stones, hanging them at their armes. They haue another wild beast, which they do take hunting, and he is to be eaten. He is as bigge as an Asse, striped with couloures redde and gréene, and hathe wreathed hornes vpward, of thrée cubites in length. Also, there is another much like vnto a Hare, with little hornes, and of coulour redde, whiche giueth a greate leape. There is another muche like vnto a Goate, with his hornes vpon his buttockes more than two cubites pending, and for that the smoke of them healeth Feauers, they are solde for more than fortie Duckets a péece. There is another much like vnto this Beast, sauing that he hathe no hornes. His hayre is redde, hauing a necke of two cubites in length. There is another bodyed lyke vnto a Camell, and of the couloure of a Lybarde, hauing a necke of fire cubites in length. They sayd he had a head like vnto a Déere. Also they sayd they had a bird of the heigth from the ground of sixe cubites, small legges, féete like a Goose, the necke and visage like vnto a Henne. This bird flyeth little, but runneth faster than a Horse.
               Many other things they told me, whiche I leaue vnwritten, for that I finde my selfe wéerie. And they sayd, that there were Serpents in the Desertes without féete, of fiftie cubits in length, hauing a Scorpions tayle, and swallow a whole Cau
