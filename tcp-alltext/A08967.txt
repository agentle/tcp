            To the Tune of Oh no, no, no, not yet.
            
            
               
               
            
            
               A Proper hansome young man,
               that dwelt in London Citie,
               Did woo a pretty Damsell,
               who was for him too witty:
               The youngman he had wealth good store,
               the Lasse was poore, though bonny,
               She pleas'd his minde, with spéeches kinde,
               and all was for his money.
            
            
               A simple silly Coxcombe,
               he shew'd himselfe to be:
               All which the crafty Damsell,
               did well perceiue and sée;
               She pleased still his humour well,
               with words as swéet as honey,
               She shew'd him still, most kind good will,
               to make him spend his money.
            
            
               He was with loue inchanted,
               and led into such folly,
               He neuer would be merry,
               but with his pretty Molly.
               
               To whom when he was come, she still
               would welcome say, swéet honey:
               Which words in mind, he tooke so kinde,
               he car'd not for-his money.
            
            
               She rolled him, she clipt him,
               she did his corpes imbrace:
               And said her onely pleasure,
               was viewing his swéet face.
               She told him that his breath and lips,
               more swéeter were then honey,
               Yet her mind ran, not on the man,
               so much, as on his money.
            
            
               And at their merry méetings,
               the youth would send for wine,
               And many pleasant Iunkets,
               for them to sup aud dine:
               As Lambe, and Ueale, and Mutton store,
               with Chickens, Larkes, and Coney.
               Thus with her wiles, and tempting smiles,
               she made him spend his money.
            
            
               He gaue her Gownes and Kirtles,
               and many costly things,
               As Girdles, Gloues, and Stockings,
               fine Bracelets, and gold Rings.
               For which he ne'r had naught from her,
               but Thanks mine owne sweet honey,
               A kisse or twaine was all his gaine,
               for all his cost and money.
            
            
               And if he ere did offer,
               to doe the thing you wot,
               When they two were in priuate,
               to him she yeelded not.
               She told him 'twas vnlawfull,
               I prethee sweet and honey,
               Urge me not too't, for Ile not doo't,
               
                  introth for any money.
            
            
               Now what should be the reason▪
               
               thinke you, she was so coy?
               It was because another man
               her fancy did inioy,
               And none but he alone, she swore,
               should haue this Wench so bonney,
               Yet this fond Asse, so simple was,
               to foole away his money
            
            
               
               The second part.
               To the same tune.
               
                  
                  
               
               
                  ALthough she had another,
                  whom she had vow'd to marry,
                  Yet to this silly woodcocke,
                  her selfe she still did carry,
                  As though she had intent at last,
                  to make him her swéet honey,
                  Yet all her drift, was by this shift,
                  to get good cloathes and mony.
               
               
                  And when she was supplied,
                  with all that she did lacke,
                  And he had put braue raiment,
                  all new vpon her backe,
                  Him carelesly she slighted then,
                  her heart to him was stony,
                  She grew so proud, she scarce alow'd
                  a smile for all his money.
               
               
                  So getting vp one morning,
                  she could no longer tarry,
                  But sending for her other Loue,
                  with him she straight did marry.
                  Now had she what she look't for,
                  and so farewell my Tommy,
                  
                  My wedding Ring, and euery thing
                  thou boughtst me with thy mony.
               
               
                  Thus in deriding manner,
                  at him she laught and fléer'd,
                  Which vexed sore the Youngman,
                  when to his shame he heard,
                  How he was for his kindnesse showne,
                  accounted simple Tommy,
                  
                  And had disgrace, in euery place.
                  for spending of his money.
               
               
                  He durst not walke for's pleasure,
                  among other youngmen,
                  But he was sure to heare on't,
                  before he came agen.
                  And one would play with t'other in sport,
                  with words as swéet as honey,
                  To act the part of his swéet heart,
                  who made him spend his money.
               
               
                  This did so vexe and grieue him,
                  he vow'd to be reuenged,
                  Quoth he, my Gowne and Kirtle,
                  ere long Ile haue new fring'd,
                  Take héed you subtill Queane, quoth he,
                  for it I light vpon yée,
                  Ile make you rue, that ere you knew
                  one penny of my money.
               
               
                  These words the Damsell heard on,
                  and being alwayes cunning,
                  She spide him as he walkt i'th stréet,
                  and to him she came running.
                  She call'd him Rogue and Rascall base,
                  you slaue quoth she, Ile stone yée;
                  And you Clowne, Ile cracke your crowne,
                  a pox of you and your money.
               
               
                  Thus with her scolding spéeches,
                  his voyce she ouercame,
                  He seeing of no remedy,
                  did let it rest for shame.
                  Let euery honest youngman then,
                  example take by Tommy,
                  
                  Lest they repent, when they haue spent,
                  vpon a Wench their money.
               
               Finis.
