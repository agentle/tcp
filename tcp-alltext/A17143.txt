            TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE Sir FRANCIS WALSINGAM Knight, Cheefe Secretarie to hir Maieſtie, and Chancellor of the Dutchie of Lankaster, grace, mercie and peace from God our Father, and from Ieſus Chriſt our Sauior.
            
               THe word of God being the immortall ſeed wherby we be conceiued and borne againe to be the children of Gods mercie,1. Pet. 1.23. and heires of his glorie:1. Pet. 2.2. the pure milke that doth nouriſh vs being infants:Matth. 4.4. the bread that doth feed vs being growen greater in Christ Ieſus:Pſal. 119.105. the light and lanterne that leadeth vs to walke in Gods waies:Epheſ. 6.17. Heb. 4.12. Matth. 4.4. Hierem. 23.29. 2. Cor. 10.5. the ſword of Gods ſpirit to defend vs againſt the aſſaults of Satan: And finallie, the hammer which beateth downe euerie high thing that is exalted against the knowledge of God: it is no maruell (Right Honorable) if Satan the enimie of our ſaluation haue in all times diligentlie indeuored to ſuppreſſe it, and to depriue vs as much as he might of the great benefit, and ſweet comfort which we are to receiue by it. Hereupon it hath come to paſſe, that in all ages, as the true and ſyncere worſhip of God hath beene corrupted and decaied, and idolatrie and wicked worſhippings haue increaſed: ſo the Law of God, which teacheth and mainteineth the one, condemneth & ouerthroweth the other, hath been ſuppreſſed, and the cleere light therof ſmothered. When the Iſraelits in the wildernes fell to Idolatrie, and worſhipped the golden calfe,Exod. 32.19. the tables of Gods commandements (which they were vnworthie to inioie) were broken. When true religion was decaied vnder Rehoboam and Abija kings of Iudah:2. Cronicl. 15.3. Iſrael was without the Priest to teach, and without the Law.2. King. 22.8. When vnder the vngodlie gouernment of Manaſſe and Amon Idolatrie raigned and raged, the booke of God was neglected and lost: when Iehoiakim an Idolater ruled, the word of God vttered by Ieremie, and written by Baruch, was cut in peeces,Ierem. 36.23. and throwne into the fire. When cruell Antiochus had taken Ieruſalem,1. Mach. 1.59. and ſought to ouerthrow the true ſeruice of God, the books of the Law which were found were burnt in the fire, and cut in peeces. And whoſoeuer

had a booke of the Testament found by him was put to death. When bloudie Diocletian went about to roote out Christian religion, he cauſed the holie Scriptures to be burnt, as Euſebius in theſe words declareth:Euſeb. eccleſ. hist. lib. 8. cap. 2. & 3.
                
               Diuináſque & ſacras Scripturas in medio foro igni tradi ipſis oculis vidimus. i. We haue ſeene with our eies the diuine and holie Scriptures in the midst of the market place throwne into the fire. And euen ſo in theſe later ages, as ſuperstition and Idolatrie (wherwith God in his iust indignation hath puniſhed the wickedneſſe of the world,2. Theſſ. 2.10. for not receiuing the loue of the truth vnto ſaluation) haue increaſed: ſo the word of God hath been greatlie neglected of the Prieſts, ſuppreſſed from the people, & being tranſlated & publiſhed by faithfull men for the ſetting forth of Gods truth, and ſaluation of his elect, haue beene in open market places (as Euſebius ſaith) burnt in the fire.Ezech. 7.26. Deut. 33.10. How the law hath periſhed from the Priests, who ſhould haue taught Iacob Gods iudgements, and Iſrael his Law, experience hath ſhewed, and learned mens writings do witnes. That famous man Eraſmus (in whoſe daies after the long winter night of ignorance, began both the clouds of darkneſſe to be disperſed,Eraſmus lib. 9. epiſt. ad Natalem▪ Beddam. and the ſunne of Gods word cleerely to ſhine forth) writeth thus: Nec pauci ſunt Theologi praeſertim ſeniores, qui adeo verſati non ſunt in priſcis doctoribus, vt nec Petrum Lombardum, nec ſcripturas canonicas vnquam totas euoluerint. That is, There be not a few diuines, especiallie of thoſe that be elder, who haue beene ſo little occupied in the old doctors, that they haue neuer read ouer Peter Lombard, nor the whole canonicall Scriptures. That learned man Andreas Hyperius witneſſeth, that he had ſeene ſundrie old eccleſiasticall men,Lib. de lectione Scripturae. who after they had receiued ſome tast of Gods truth, confeſſed and lamented, that they had neuer read the holie Scriptures. But if theſe testimonies will not ſerue to ſatiſfie ſome, for the conuincing of the great and groſſe ignorance, which as a vaile couered the Prieſts eies from beholding the bright beames of Gods word,Aeneas Syluius Comment. de dict. & fact. Alphonſ. Reg. lib. 2.17.
                let them marke what Pope Pius ſecundus writeth hereof in theſe words: Pudeat Italiae ſacerdotes, quos ne ſemel quidem nouam legem conſtat legiſſe. Apud Thaboritas vix mulierculam inuenias, quae de nouo Teſtamento & veteri reſpondere neſciat. That is, The Priests of Italie may be aſhamed, who are knowne not once to haue read the new Testament: ſeeing with the Which followed the doctrine preached by Hus. Thaborits (in Bohemia) one can hardly find

a ſeelie woman which cannot anſwere out of the old and new Testament.
And if thoſe Italian Priests, which were vnder that holie fathers noſe, were ſo blind in Gods booke, what may be thought of them that were further off? vnleſſe peraduenture, the neerer they were to him, the more they were infected, poyſoned, and blinded by him. And if the ſunne went downe vpon thoſe Prophets,Mich. 3.6. and darkneſſe was vnto them for a diuination, that ſhould haue beene the light of the world, & the eies of the bodie,Matth. 5.14.6.23. how great was the darkneſſe in the bodie it ſelfe? Especiallie ſeeing theſe hypocriticall phariſies tooke away the keie of knowledge,Luke 11.52. and as they entred not in themſelues, ſo they forbad them that would, in keeping the light of Gods word vnder the buſhell of a ſtrange toong, and not permitting it to be tranſlated into vulgar and knowne languages, and ſo to be ſet vpon a candlesticke to ſhine to the instruction and conſolation of them that be in Gods houſe. Wherein they haue ſhewed themſelues to be hereticall Priests,Chryſost. expoſit. 2. in Matth. hom. 44.
                who (as Chryſoſtom ſaith) ſhut vp the gates of the truth: for they know that if the truth once appeare, they must needs leaue their Church, & from the dignitie of their prieſthood come downe to the ſtate of other people. Euen ſo our Haereticall popiſh prelats and priests to mainteine their Idolatrie, pompe, pride, and couetouſneſſe haue ſhut vp the gates of the truth, by ſuppreſſing Gods holie word, and keeping it from the knowledge of Gods people: as Eraſmus trulie affirmeth in theſe words;Quis non intelligat iſtos ſacras literas ideo velle paucis eſſe notas,Eraſm. li. epist. 21. ad Nicol. Euerardum. ne quid decedat ipſorum autoritati quaeſtuíque. That is, Who knoweth not that theſe men (meaning popiſh Priests & Moonks) would therefore haue the holie Scriptures known but to few, least their authoritie and gaine ſhould decaie. And euen ſo it is certaine, that if the holie ſcriptures had beene publikelie in the mother toong, and in the hands and harts of the people, they could neuer heretofore haue beene with the vſurped power of that pelting and powling Priest of Rome ſo astonied and amazed, with images deceiued, with pardons beguiled, with fained & forged reliques mocked, with maſſes, trentals and purgatorie ſpoiled, with the hypocriſie of Moonks and ſuch other locusts bewitched, and manie mo waies miſerablie abuſed as they were
But they being vtterlie bereft, and altogether depriued of this light of Gods word,Eſai. 9.2. 1. Iohn 2.22. did ſit in darkneſſe and in the ſhadow of death: Walked in darkneſſe and wist not whither they went, bicauſe the darknes had blinded their eies.

And whereas God of his great mercie, beholding our miſerie, hath deliuered vs from this Aegyptiacall darkneſſe, and cauſed the day ſtar of his holie word to riſe vnto vs, to lead vs (as did that other the wiſe men) vnto Ieſus Christ,Matth. 2.9. in him onely to ſeeke our ſaluation:
                  Eſai. 9.2. Lib. de reſurrect. carnis. ſo that we which haue heeretofore walked in darkneſſe, haue ſeene a great light, to our vnſpeakeable comfort: theſe Fliers of the light of the Scriptures. 
               Lucifugae Scripturarum (as Tertullian called ſome, and I may truly terme theſe Popiſh owles) haue howled and exclaimed against this light, which by the holy Scriptures tranſlated into our mother toong hath ſhined vnto vs.D. Standiſh in a fooliſh booke ſet foorth in Q. Maries daies. They haue written againſt it, affirming that it ought not to be in the vulgar language, Idem ibid. probat. 3.

In the beginning of their Preface.
                and ſaying that it is an occaſion of Hereſie, and haue with all their might and maine gone about to extinguiſh it. Theſe their aſſertions how falſe and abſurd they be, contrarie to the word of God, and the writings of the ancient godly fathers, I will not (leſt I be too tedious vnto your Honor) at this preſent further declare.
            Notwithstanding all this their barking against hauing the holie Scriptures in the mother toong: yet now our Rhemiſh and Romiſh Papiſts heerin differing from their fellowes, & playing the Apes in imitating vs, as they haue doone alſo in ſetting foorth Catechiſmes which before they could neuer abide, haue at the last publiſhed the new Testament in our Engliſh toong, and haue promiſed the rest, which (notwithſtanding they ſaie was long ago doone) hath beene, and I doubt, will be long in performing. This they haue doone, not of a holie zeale, and godlie deſire to haue the holie Scripture knowne and read of all people: but rather to keepe them, especiallie their adherents & fauorers from reading it tranſlated & ſet foorth by vs. In this their worke ſo long deferred, and now publiſhed, they haue committed two foule faults: The one in falſelie and fooliſhlie tranſlating it, by following the corrupt ſtreame of the Latin tranſlation, and forſaking the fountaine of the Greeke, wherein the holy ſpirit of God did indite the new Teſtament, and the bleſſed Apoſtles of Chriſt our Sauior did write it. The other in corrupting & peruerting the ſenſe, and meaning of the holy Ghoſt by guilefull gloſes, and abſurd Annotations. Againſt the former of theſe faults I did, either almost, or altogether fiue yeers past, write the first part of this little diſcourſe vpon this occaſion: The right honorable and my verie good Lord, the L. Saint Iohns of Blet ſo ſhortlie after the comming foorth of the ſaid Testament, did let me haue for the ſpace of a month the

vſe of it. The which I did verie egarly read, and diligentlie confer. And for that the booke was hard to come by, I did write much out of it, concerning the diuerſitie, ſuperfluitie, and want of the ſaid tranſlation in respect of the Greeke: and alſo their 10. friuolous reaſons in their preface, which moued them to leaue the Greeke, and tranſlate the Latine, with diuers other things. Vnto the which 10. reaſons I did then vpon a particular occaſion, & for a priuat vſe write this anſwere, neuer intending (as both ſome men do know, and the long ſuppreſſing of it may ſhew) to publiſh the ſame in print. And the rather for that a full anſwere vnto the whole hath beene long looked for of manie, and wiſhed for of me. The which I would right gladlie haue ſeene, to the perpetuall ſuppreſſing of this as I firſt intended. But when no ſuch anſwere came foorth, neither could I learne when anie would: hauing of late a little recogniſed my anſwere that had lien long neglected by me, and added thereunto a diſcouerie of ſundrie corruptions committed in the ſaid tranſlation, I haue beene mooued by ſome that haue ſeene it, to let it paſſe in print. The which although I was a long time vnwilling to doo: yet for that it is thought the ſaid tranſlation and Annotations haue ſeduced ſome, and confirmed others in error, and manie doo not a little glory of them, I haue yeelded to the putting foorth of this little treatiſe: that as ſome haue alreadie in part diſcouered the abſurditie of the Annotations:D. Reynolds▪ D. Bilſon. M. Prime. ſo this I trust may ſufficiently ſhew the weakneſſe of thoſe reaſons, and corruption of that tranſlation. This ſmall and ſimple diſcourſe although I confeſſe it to be vnworthie your worthineſſe, yet vpon your great curteſie, I haue beene bold to offer it vnto your Honor, to testifie thereby my dutifull mind, and thankefull hart vnto your H. for your fauor ſhewed me, which I haue found and felt. Humblie beſeeching your H. to accept this ſmall mite in goodpart, not weighing the quantitie or value of the gift, but the ſincere and hartie affection toward your H. of the giuer. God in great mercie bleſſe your H. increaſe his graces and good gifts in you, and long preſerue you to the ſeruice & ſafetie of hir Maieſtie, and the benefit of this Church and Commonwealth, Amen.

            AN ANSWER TO THE FRIVOLOVS and reaſonleſſe reaſons of the Rhemiſh Ieſuits, for following and preferring the old Latin tranſlation of the New Testament before the Greeke, wherein Gods Spirit indited it, and the holy Apoſtles did write it. Which reaſons be ſet downe in their Preface before the New Teſtament, by them lately tranſlated into Engliſh: by E. B.
            
               The first reaſon of the Ieſuits.
               NOw to giue thee alſo intelligence in particular, moſt gentle Reader, of ſuch things as it behoueth thee ſpecially to know concerning our tranſlation: we tranſlate the old vulgar Latin text, nor the common Greeke text, for theſe cauſes. It is ſo ancient, that it was vſed in the Church of God aboue 1300. yeeres ago, as appeereth by the fathers of thoſe times.
               
                  Anſwer.
                  
                     HEre is an vncertaine aſſertion, and a fooliſh reaſon. For although I grant the ſaid tranſlation to be ancient, yet to be ſo old as they affirme, I ſuppoſe it wil be hard for al the Rhemiſh rout of Ieſuits plainly to prooue. Tertullian, who liued ſomwhat aboue 200. yeeres after Chriſt, doth not follow it, neither hath any ſteps of it in the places which he alledgeth. Cyprian, who liued about the yéere of Chriſt 284. doth not at all vſe it. Hilarius, Hierom, and Auguſtine in their allegations of the Scriptures diſſent from it. But to omit to ſpeake any more of the antiquitie of it: what a fooliſh reaſon is this; It is 1300. yéeres old, therfore true and vncorrupt. The Gréeke tranſlations of the Septuaginta interpretors, of Symmachus, Aquila, and Theodotion were ancient, yet euen in S. Hieroms time wanted not many and great corruptions. The Latin tranſlations (which in S. Hieroms and Auguſtines daies were many) were euen then very corrupt, as héerafter I wil (by Gods

grace) out of S. Hierom declare. Or what a fond reaſon is this: It is 1300. yéeres old, therefore to be preferred before the Gréeke, which being the originall is aboue 1500. yéeres old. So that if this matter be to be meaſured by antiquitie, the Gréeke were to be preferred, and this Latin tranſlation not to be followed.
               
            
            
               2. Reaſon.
               
               IT is that (by common receiued opinion, and by all probabilitie) which S. Hierom afterward corrected according to the Greeke, by the appointment of Damaſus then pope, as he maketh mention in his Preface before the iiij. Euangeliſts vnto the ſaid Damaſus, and in Catalogo in fine.
               
               
                  Anſwer.
                  THis is but a popiſh and fooliſh opinion, void of all probabilitie and truth: for proofe whereof I will firſt alledge the ſaying of that learned man Eraſmus Roterodamus, which I doubt not, but with all wiſe and learned men will counteruaile our Rhemiſh Ieſuits, and all their adherents.Eraſmus epist. N. amico ex aninco dilecto. Who in an Epiſtle writeth thus: Ceu confeſſum aſſumit, hanc Noui Testamenti tranſlationem qua vulgò vtimur eſſe Hieronimi, cum eam constet nec eſſe Cypriani, nec Hilarij, nec Ambrosij, nec Auguſtini, nec Hieronimi cùm is diuerſa legat: multò minùs eam quam emendaſſe testatur, cùm in hac deprehendantur, quae ille damnat, non ſolùm quantum ad verba, verùm etiam quantum ad ſententiam. That is: He taketh it as granted, that this tranſlation of the new Teſtament, which we do commonly vſe is Hieroms, whereas it is certaine, that it is neither Cyprians, nor Hilaries, nor Ambroſes, nor Auguſtines, nor Hieroms, foraſmuch as he diſſenteth from it, and much leſſe to be that which he teſtifieth that he corrected, ſéeing there be found in this which he condemneth, not onely as touching the words, but alſo the ſenſe and meaning. Héere Eraſmus flatly affirmeth, that this common Latin tranſlation, was neither made by Hierom, nor is that which he at the requeſt of Damaſus corrected. And to prooue both the truth of Eraſmus aſſertion, and the falſhood of our Ieſuits receiued opinion, I will ſet downe a few places, wherein Hierom not onely diſſenteth from it, but alſo findeth fault with it. In

his firſt booke againſt Iouinian he writeth thus:Hierom. lib. 1. aduerſus Iouinianum.
                     Ita tamen ſi ipſos filios erudiret in fide & dilectione & in ſanctificatione & pudicitia. Non enim (vt malè habetur in Latinis codicibus) Sobrietas est legenda, ſed castitas, id est, 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . That is: Yet ſo if ſhe inſtruct hir children in faith and loue, and in ſanctification and chaſtitie: for it is not to be read Sobrietas, ſobrietie (as it is euill tranſlated in the Latin bookes) but Castitas, chaſtitie: for that is 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Againe in the ſame booke: Sobrium (ſiue vt melius in Graeco dicitur) vigilātem, id eſt, 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . pudicum, hoc enim ſignificat 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . That is: Sober, or as it is better in the Gréek watchfull, for that doth 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      ſignifie; chaſte, for that doth 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      ſignifie. And againe in the ſame booke: Non plus ſapere quàm oportet ſapere, ſed ſapere ad pudicitiam, non ad ſobrietatem, vt male in Latinis legitur, ſed ſapere inquit ad pudicitiam. That is: Not to be wiſe aboue that ye ought to be wiſe, but to be wiſe vnto chaſtitie, not vnto ſobrietie, as it is euill tranſlated in the Latin bookes, but, ſaith he, to be wiſe to chaſtitie. In all theſe places Hierom miſliketh and condemneth that which is in our Latin common tranſlation. And although I confeſſe that he to helpe his cauſe, doth without ſufficient cauſe find fault in theſe places with the ſaid tranſlation, for that the words 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      and 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      do more properly and aptly ſignifie Sobrietie and Sober, than chaſtitie and chaſte: as alſo Eraſmus in his Scholies in theſe words doth ſhew:Eraſmus in Scholijs in lib. 1. aduerſus Ieuinianum. 
                     Torquet nonnihil hunc locum Hieronimus ad commoditatem cauſae ſuae: nam hie certè magis quadrat vertere modestiam vel ſobrietatem quàm pudicitiam, 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , id est, ad hoc vt ſobrij ſint & modesti, non inſolentes & elati. That is, Hierom ſomewhat wreſteth this place to the commoditie of his cauſe: for ſurely it is more fit to tranſlate it modeſtie or ſobrietie than chaſtitie, that they ſhould be ſober and modeſt, not inſolent and proud: yet it is ſufficient for me, that he miſliketh and findeth fault with that which is in our common Latin tranſlation: which is a plaine proofe that this was not his, for then he would otherwiſe haue tranſlated it. Hierom alſo findeth fault with the vulgar tranſlation of that place of S. Paule, Galat. 5.9. in theſe words:Hierom. in epist. ad Galat. cap. 5.
                     
                     Malè in nostris codicibus habetur: Modicum fermentum totam maſſam corrumpit: & ſenſumpotiùs interpres ſuum, quàm verba Apostoli transtulit. That

is, It is euill tranſlated in our Latin bookes, Modicum fermentum totam maſſam corrumpit: and the interpretor hath tranſlated rather his owne meaning, than the words of the Apoſtle. And there he doth tranſlate it otherwiſe: Modicum fermentum totam conſperſionem fermentat. But what néede I to buſie my ſelfe in ſeeking mo places where S. Hierom findeth fault with that which is in the vulgar Latin tranſlation, ſéeing that Andradius the Spaniſh Ieſuit hath eaſed me of that labour, who hath piked out and produced a number of places, in the which Hierom miſliketh that which is in the ſaid tranſlation.Andr. defenſ. Trident. fidei▪ fol. 411.
                      
                     Andradius liking of them that require more diligence and plainnes in the ſaid old tranſlator, writeth thus: Nàm dum vel Graecorum dicendi rationi nimium adhaereſcit, &c. That is, For whileſt he either doth too much cleaue to the Gréeke phraſe, or is not diligent inough in weighing the Latin and Greeke words, he becommeth ſomtime ouer obſcure, and doth not ſufficiently expreſſe the force and power of the ſentences. The which although I could make manifeſt by many examples, yet I will produce ſome of thoſe which S. Hierom noteth, that by reaſon of the authoritie of that moſt holy father, they may with all men be ſubiect to leſſe enuie. In the Epiſtle to the Galathians (ſaith he) it is euill tranſlated in Latin, Euacuati estis à Christo, where it ſhould be ſaid, In Christi opera ceſſastis, the which the force of the Gréeke word 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      doth moſt expreſſe, which ſignifieth to aboliſh, to make vaine and fruſtrate. In his commentarie alſo vpon the Epiſtle to the Epheſians, he findeth fault with the old tranſlator for tranſlating the Gréeke word 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , armaturam, id est, armor, whereas it ſignifieth all furniture of armor, or whole armor. And expounding that ſaying of S. Paule,

                     Vt mundaret ſibi populum acceptabilem, he doth at large accuſe the drowſie negligence of the Latin interpretors, for tranſlating the word,

                     acceptabilem, which ſignifieth excellent,Alledged before. ſpeciall, and chiefly peculiar. And diſputing againſt Iouinian of chaſtitie, in the firſt epiſtle to Timothie (ſaith he) it is not to be read, as it is euill in the Latin bookes, Si permanſerint in fide cum ſobrietate,
                     He meaneth Eraſmus, as is before alledged. 
                     ſed cum castitate, id enim est 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . although there be learned men which prefer héerein the vulgar tranſlator before Hierom, who do thinke 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                     
to be as it were 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , that is, the ſoundnes or preſeruation of wiſedome, as it is in Plato, wherevnto is oppoſed 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , that is, madnes. And in his firſt booke againſt the Pelagians, he ſaith: The ſimplicitie of the Latin tranſlator doth count among the properties and duties of a Biſhop, that he be docibilis, that is, docible, whereas Paule calleth a Biſhop 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , that is, apt and méete to teach, the which word the ſame interpretor in the firſt Epiſtle to Timothie doth tranſlate not very fitly, Doctorem, that is, a teacher, whereas many do ſo vnwoorthily performe the dutie of teaching, that they ſéeme to be apt and fit to execute no dutie. But Paul (ſaith he) doth not onely thinke, that it is the part of a Biſhop to performe vnto the Church that great dutie of teaching, but alſo that he ought to be furniſhed with excellent gifts and helps to teach. It were long to handle all the places, in which not only Hierom, but alſo other very godly men require diligence in the vulgar tranſlator. Hitherto Andradius the Spaniſh Ieſuit.
By the which it may plainly appéere, both that this vulgar Latin tranſlation was not Hieroms, for that he doth ſo much miſlike it, and find fault with it: and alſo what iarre in iudgement there is in this matter betweene our Engliſh Rhemiſh Ieſuits, who héere iudge it to be S. Hieroms, and this Spaniſh Ieſuit that doth denie it. By this I doubt not, but it doth moſt euidently appéere, how falſe this ſecond aſſertion of the Ieſuits is, and that this common Latin tranſlation, was neither by S. Hierom tranſlated, nor that which he corrected. Whereunto I will adde further a ſaying or two of Eraſmus, who writeth thus:Eraſmus in Scholijs in Hieronimum ad Algaſiam. 
                     Multò rectius haec vertit Hieronimus, quàm habet vulgata aeditio. That is, Hierom doth much better tranſlate this, than our vulgar edition hath it, meaning that in 2. Theſ. 2. where S. Paul ſpeaketh of the man of ſin, and ſonne of perdition, &c. where no doubt if this had béene Hieroms tranſlation as the Ieſuits would haue it, he would as well haue tranſlated it in the text, as he alledged it in his booke. Againe, Eraſmus writeth thus of Hierom:Eraſmus in Scholijs in epist. Hieron. ad Pammachium. 
                     Apertè damnat ſuperiorem tranſlationem qua nos tamen maxima ex parte vtimur. That is, He plainly condemneth the former tranſlation, which we yet for the moſt part vſe: meaning this old common tranſlation, the

which he ſaith Hierom doth condemne.
                  But if I ſhould grant our Ieſuits that this were either tranſlated or corrected by Hierom, which they will neuer be able to prooue, and by that which I haue ſaid, is apparantly falſe, what haue they then gained? Doth it therefore follow bicauſe it was either truly tranſlated, or faithfully corrected by S. Hierom then, therefore it is true, ſincere, and void of corruption now? S. Hierom himſelfe complaineth of the great corruption of the Latin tranſlations in his daies, the which yet came not ſo much by the tranſlators, as by the negligent writers out of the bookes, and preſumptuous correctors, or rather corruptors, as moſt plainly appéereth by Hierom himſelfe in many places, whereof I will ſet downe ſome.Hieronimus praefatione in Ioſue. In his preface before Ioſue he writeth thus: Maximè cùm apud Latinos tot ſunt exemplaria, quot codices: & vnuſquiſque pro arbitrio ſuo, vel adderit vel ſubtraxerit quod ei viſum est. That is, ſéeing with the Latins there be as many examples or copies as books, and that euery one according to his owne will hath added and taken away as pleaſed him. And againe he writeth thus:Hieronimus ad Marcellum som. 3.
                      
                     Vt aliquid de Dominicis verbis aut corrigendum putauerimus, aut non diuinitùs inſpiratum: ſed Latinorum codicum vitioſitatem, quae ex diuerſitate librorum omnium comprobatur, ad Graecam originem (vnde & ipſi tranſlata eſſe non denegant) voluiſſe reuocare. Quibus ſi diſplicet fontis vnda puriſſimi, coenoſos riuulos bibant. That is, I do not thinke that the Lords words are to be corrected, or that they were not inſpired of God: but I go about to correct the falſenes of the Latin bookes, the which is plainly prooued by the diuerſity of them, and to bring them to the originall of the Gréeke (from the which they do not denie that they were tranſlated) who if they miſlike the water of the moſt pure fountaine, they may drinke their mirie puddles, meaning of the Latin. Laſtly, S. Hierom in the ſame place héere alledged by the Ieſuits hath theſe words:Hieronimus ad Damaſum praefatione in 4. Euang. 
                     Si enim Latinis exemplaribus fides est adhibenda, reſpondeant quibus? Tot enim ſunt exemplaria penè quot codices. Sin autem veritas est quaerenda de pluribus, cur non ad Graecam originem reuertentes, ea quae vel à vitioſis interpretibus malè reddita: vel à praeſumptoribus imperitis emendata peruerſius, vel à librarijs dormitantibus aut addita ſunt aut mutata corrigimus?
                     
That is, If we muſt beléeue the Latin examples, let them tell vs which? for there be as many diuers copies as bookes. But if they thinke that the truth is to be ſought out of the greater part, why do we not returne to the Gréeke originall, and correct theſe things which either vnſkilfull tranſlators haue ill tranſlated, or of ignorant preſumptuous perſons haue béene fooliſhly amended, or of negligent writers haue béene either added or altered?
By theſe and many ſuch other places it doth appéere, how corrupt the Latin bookes of the new Teſtament were in thoſe daies, which faults yet were moſt ſpecially to be attributed to negligent writers. And if in thoſe learned times of the primitiue Church, in which ſo many learned and godly fathers liued, ſuch manifold groſſe and great corruptions crept into the Latin bookes of the Bible, what may we thinke of theſe latter times, in which all good learning was loſt; and blindnes, ignorance, and barbarouſnes haue raigned? Is it to be maruelled, though infinite great corruptions haue come into the Latin copies of the Teſtament? ſpecially ſéeing the ſame were much written and copied out by blinde ignorant Moonks, who all in a maner were ſo vnlearned, that it became a prouerbe, Monacho indoctior, that is, More vnlearned than a Moonke. By whoſe meanes ſuch good authors as were moſt occupied and written out, were moſt corrupt, as Ludouicus Viues doth iuſtly complaine in theſe words:Ludouicus Viues de cauſ. corrupt. artium. fol. 13.
                     
                     Videmus vt quiſque veterum ſcriptorum hijs quingentis annis in ſtudioſorum manibus verſatus est, ita ad nos veniſſe corruptiſſimos, vt Plinium, Senecam, Hieronimum, Augustinum, Aristotelem. Puriores ſunt atque integriores qui in vetustis Bibliothecis ſitu & puluere latuerunt obſeſſi. That is, We ſée how that as euery one of the old writers were theſe 500. yéeres moſt occupied in ſtudents hands, ſo they haue come moſt corrupt vnto vs, as Plinie, Seneca, Hierom, Auguſtine, & Ariſtotle. And that they haue remained more pure and perfect, which haue lien in old libraries in duſt and filth. By which reaſon of Viues it may be gathered, that the Gréeke text of the Teſtament hath continued the more ſound and ſincere, bicauſe by reaſon of the ignorance of that toong, it hath béen leſſe occupied, and ſeldomer in the vnwaſhen hands of thoſe ignorant and filthy Moonks.

Héereby alſo it appéereth, that if this vulgar tranſlation had béene of S. Hieroms either tranſlation or correction, it doth not follow, that it is now ſound and ſincere. But foraſmuch as there be many faults and corruptions in it (as by Gods grace héereafter ſhall be ſhewed) we ought (according to the iudgement of S. Hierom) returne to the originall of the Gréeke, and thereby correct them. The which our Rhemiſh and Romiſh Ieſuits refuſing to do, in forſaking the water of the moſt pure fountaine of the original Gréeke: we are content they drinke (to vſe S. Hieroms words) the mirie puddles of the Latin.Ad Marcellum.
                  
                  Finally, whereas our Ieſuits would make their ſimple readers beléeue, that Damaſus had ſuch ſupreme power as is now by the Biſhop of Rome claimed, by calling him Pope, and by ſhewing that S. Hierom by his appointment did correct the Latin copies: I thinke it not vnfit nor impertinent to ſet downe the opinion of Eraſmus in this matter, who as he was excellently learned, ſo is he not to be counted as partiall.Eraſmus in epist. amico ex animo dilecto.
He in the Epiſtle before alledged, ſpeaking of this matter hath theſe words: Quanquam hoc negotij non iniungit Damaſus tanquam ſummus orbis Pontifex, quod an fuerit in medio relinquo: certè nomen hoc nondum illis temporibus erat auditum, quantum ex veterum omnium ſcriptis licet colligere, ſed iniungit tanquam Romanus Pontifex Hieronimo hactenus Romano, quòd illic & baptizatus ſit, & preſbyteri conſecutus honorem. That is, Although Damaſus do not inioine this buſines, as the chéefe Biſhop of the world, the which whether he were or not, I will not define: ſurely this name in thoſe daies was not as yet heard of, as far as we may gather by the writings of all the ancient fathers: but he doth inioine it as Biſhop of Rome to Hierom hitherto a Roman, bicauſe both there he was baptized, and obtained the degrée and dignitie of prieſthood.
And as for the name Pope, in thoſe daies it was a title not peculiar to the Biſhop of Rome (as now they haue made it) but common to euery Biſhop. Saint Hierom calleth both S. Auguſtine Biſhop of Hippo in Afrike, and Epiphanius Biſhop of Salamine in Cyprus Pope. The elders and deacons of Rome called Cyprian Biſhop of Carthage Pope. Thus I truſt I haue ſufficiently diſcouered the inſufficiencie

of this ſecond reaſon, and plainly prooued that there is no probabilitie in this opinion, and that this vulgar Latin tranſlation, which our Rhemiſts haue followed, is not that which S. Hierom either tranſlated or corrected. Now let vs examine the third reaſon.
               
            
            
               3. Reaſon.
               
               COnſequently it is that ſame which S. Auguſtine ſo commendeth and alloweth in an Epiſtle to S. Hierom.
                     Epist. 10.
               
               
                  Anſwer.
                  THere is no conſequence in this conſequence. For the antecedent not being true (as I haue before ſufficiently prooued) the conſequence non conſequitur. Indéede Auguſtine doth commend Hieroms tranſlation of the Goſpell out of the Gréeke: but that this which you follow is not that, I haue before plainly prooued. And if it were, yet it might ſince be corrupted, as I haue before ſhewed. And that it hath béene fowly corrupted, ſhall héerafter (Chriſt willing) euidently appéere. But whereas Auguſtine commendeth Hieroms tranſlation out of the Gréeke: this doth make againſt you, who refuſe the Gréeke, and tranſlate out of the Latin: which neither Hierom would do, nor Auguſtine commend.
               
            
            
               4. Reaſon.
               
               IT is that which for the moſt part euer ſince hath beene vſed in the churches ſeruice, expounded in ſermons, alledged and interpreted in the commentaries and writings of the ancient fathers of the Latin Church.
               
                  Anſwer.
                  THere is ſmall reaſon in this reaſon, why this Latin tranſlation ſhould be preferred and followed before the Gréeke. Firſt, for that the Gréeke fathers haue followed the Gréeke originall, and not this Latin, from the which generally they do diſſent, as ſhall héereafter be ſhewed.

Secondly, the moſt ancient Latin fathers do not follow it, as Tertullian, Cyprian, Hilarie, and Hierom commonly in citations and allegations of places diſſenteth from, yea and findeth fault with it (as hath béene ſhewed:) Ambroſe and Auguſtine although they ſéeme more to incline vnto it, yet very oft they leaue it, and differ from it. Therefore the Gréeke fathers generally diſſenting from it, and the moſt ancient Latin fathers hauing no footſteps of it, and the other fathers often going from it: there is (as I ſaid) ſmall reaſon why it ſhould now be counted autentical, & be preferred and folowed before the original of the Gréeke. As for the Church ſeruice, it was in the primitiue Church in that language, which of the people was vnderſtood. And where it was in Latin, it was there where the people by reaſon of the Roman empire vnderſtood latin, as appéereth by S. Auguſtines ſermons, and other authors. As touching your popiſh ſeruice full of idolatrie & ſuperſtition, and vſed in a ſtrange toong vnknowen to the people,1. Cor. 14. contrarie to the expreſſe word of God, as we care not what tranſlation it hath followed, ſo we thinke the moſt corrupt moſt méete for it.
               
            
            
               5. Reaſon.
               
               THe holy Councell of Trent, for theſe and many other important conſiderations, hath declared and defined this only of all other Latin tranſlations to be autenticall, and ſo onely to be vſed and taken in publike leſſons, diſputations, preachings, and expoſitions, and that no man preſume vpon any pretence to reiect or refuſe the ſame.
               
                  Anſwer.
                  THe decrée of ſome more ancient Councell in this matter, if any could be had, as none would be found, might haue ſtood you in far greater ſtead. For howſoeuer this Tridentine conuenticle (as euen Henrie 2. the French king termed it) moue you, ſurely it is of ſmall force to perſuade vs. We little care what it hath héerin determined, being called togither and gouerned by the Pope, whom we iuſtly accuſe to be the Archenimie of God, whereof you all

ſhall neuer be able to excuſe him, and conſiſting of about 40. blind Biſhops his ſworne ſeruants. This curſed conuenticle or Councell we no more eſtéeme, than the godly fathers eſtéemed the Councels of Ariminum, Tyre, Epheſinum 2. and ſuch others. And when you and all your adherents ſhall be able to prooue the canons of that Tridentine Councell to be grounded vpon the foundations of the Prophets and Apoſtles, and agréeable with Gods bleſſed word, then will we acknowledge the truth of this conſtitution: In the meane time we will not maruell if a corrupt Councell maintaine a corrupt tranſlation.
               
            
            
               6. Reaſon.
               
               IT is the graueſt, ſincereſt, of greateſt maieſtie, leaſt partialitie, as being without all reſpect of controuerſies and contentions, ſpecially of this our time, as appeereth by thoſe which Eraſmus and others at this day tranſlate, much more to the aduantage of the catholike cauſe.
               
                  Anſwer.
                  HEre be bare and naked aſſertions without any proofe: which may as well be denied of vs as affirmed by them. And therefore this I ſay, that the tranſlations of Eraſmus and Beza be as graue, of as great maieſtie, as ſincere, and as little partiall, as is the common Latin. And in ſome part to prooue this my affirmation, this I ſay, that that tranſlation which hath many both barbarous phraſes, and groſſe ſoloeciſmes, is not to be counted ſo graue, maieſticall, and ſincere: but this vulgar tranſlation, which they magnifie, hath many ſuch: ergo it is not ſo graue, &c. Some few for example I will ſhew, to alledge all were infinite. What grauitie and ſinceritie is in theſe words:Matth. 20.2
                           •
                        
                      
                     Principes gentium dominantur eorum: where the maſculine gender is put for the feminine, eorum for earum, and the genitiue caſe for the datiue, contrarie to the rules of Grammar, and ſo falſe Latin committed. Or in theſe words:Matth. 6.26. 
                     Nònne vos magis plures estis illis. Or theſe:Hebr▪ 2.9. 
                     Eum qui modico quàm Angeli minoratus est. Or theſe: Memorari testamenti ſui ſancti. Or theſe:Luc. 1.72.
                     
                     Vir timoratus ſecundum legem.
                     Act. 22.12. Matt. 24.6. Luc. 21.38. Or theſe: Opiniones praeliorum. Or, Populus manicabat ad eum in templo. Many ſuch other and woorſe might be alledged, wherein I ſuppoſe no wiſe and learned man will thinke any grauitie, maieſtie, or ſinceritie to be. As touching partialitie whatſoeuer you pretend, yet if you in your conſciences did not iudge it to be more partiall and fauorable for your doctrine, you would neuer preferre it before the originall of the Greeke contrarie to the iudgement of the ancient fathers, and of the beſt learned of your owne ſide lately and as yet liuing.Lud. Viues. Arius Mo
                           •
                        t. And that you do know it to be more partiall for you than the Grooke, I will prooue by a few examples which may ſerue for many. Iohn. 14. v. 26. The common Latin tranſlation hath it thus: Suggeret vobis omnia quaecun
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         dixero vobis, which you thus finely tranſlate: Shall ſuggeſt vnto you all things whatſoeuer I ſhall ſay vnto you. Where you know the Gréeke hath 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . all things which I haue ſaid or ſpoken vnto you. Is not this tranſlation of yours more partiall to maintaine the traditions of your church, and decrées of Popes and Councels, than the originall of the Gréeke? In the 10. of Luke, verſ. 35. the vulgar Latin tranſlation hath it thus: Et quodcunque ſupererogaueris, ego cùm rediero, reddam tibi: which you haue tranſlated; Whatſoeuer thou ſhalt ſupererogate, &c. doth not this make more for your works of ſupererogation (which I may well call ſupererrogant works) than the Gréeke, which is: Whatſoeuer thou ſpendeſt more, &c. In the 13. to the Hebrewes, verſ. 16. the Latin tranſlation is thus: Talibus enim hostijs promeretur Deus, which fond tranſlation, you more fondly and fooliſhly tranſlate thus: For with ſuch hoſts God is promerited. Doth not this make more for your doctrine of Merits than the fountaine of the Gréeke? which is, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . That is, With ſuch ſacrifices God is delighted or well pleaſed. And for defence of the ſame doctrine of Merit, doth not the omitting of thoſe words, Rom. 11.6. ſerue to your purpoſe? But if it be of works, it is no more grace: or els were worke no worke. Doth not, I ſay, the daſhing out of theſe words in the text well ſerue your turne? The which notwithſtanding be found in al Gréeke copies, in the ancient Syrian tranſlation, in Chryſoſtom, and other fathers. And

to the maintenance of the ſame doctrine, may not that which is in your vulgar tranſlation, Philip. 1.28. be more fitly applied than the Gréeke? Will you not thereof better gather, that the ſuffering of afflictions is a cauſe of ſaluation,Cauſa. than of the Gréeke which ſaith,
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . it is a declaration or token of ſaluation, whereunto the children of God do paſſe through manifold tribulations? Doth not the Latin vulgar tranſlation in the 5. to the Epheſians: Sacramentum hoc magnum est: This is a great ſacrament, ſtand you in better ſtead to prooue Mariage one of your ſeuen ſacraments, than the Gréeke? 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . That is, This is a great myſterie or ſecret, which S. Paul ſpeaketh and meaneth of Chriſt and his Church. Sundrie ſuch other examples might be alledged, but theſe at this time ſhall ſuffice to ſhew, that whatſoeuer you ſay in word, or pretend in ſhew, it is the partialitie it ſéemeth to beare to your doctrine, that mooueth you to follow it, and to prefer it before the fountaine of the Gréeke: the which how abſurd it is ſhall héerafter be ſhewed.

               IT is ſo exact and preciſe according to the Greeke both the phraſe and the word, that delicate heretikes therefore reprehend it of rudenes. And that it followeth the Greeke more exactly than the Proteſtants tranſlations, beſides infinite other places we appeale to theſe, Tit. 3.14. Curent bonis operibus praeeſſe,

                  Anſwer.
                  WE do not miſlike it for the ſimplicitie of phraſe: for ſuch is the Gréeke wherin the Apoſtles wrote, being far from the ſwelling eloquence of profane orators. Where vnder the low ſimplicitie of phraſe, we behold the mightie maieſtie of Gods ſpirit: but bicauſe in ſome places it is barbarous, and in very many places is not (as

you ſay) exact and preciſe acording to the Gréeke, but diſſenteth from it, and is euen contrarie to it. As for example, 1. Pet. 2.23. Tradidit iudicanti ſe iniustè, which you tranſlate: He deliuered himſelfe to him that iudged him vniuſtly; wheras you know it is in the Gréeke, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . That is, He committed himſelfe (or his cauſe) to him that iudgeth iuſtly. Now betwéene iudging iuſtly, as it is in the Gréeke, in the ancient Syrian tranſlation, and in Oecumenius the Gréeke ſcholiaſt, and iudging vniuſtly, as it is in the Latin and your Engliſh, there is no exact nor preciſe agréement, but a plaine contradiction. So in the 1. Cor. 15.51. in the vulgar Latin tranſlation it is thus: Omnes quidem reſurgemus, ſed non omnes immutabimur, which you tranſlate thus: We ſhall all indéed riſe againe, but we ſhall not all be changed. Wheras it is in the Gréeke, as we haue tranſlated: We ſhall not all ſléepe, but we ſhall al be changed. And that other is ſo far from being exact and preciſe according to the Gréeke, that S. Hierom writeth, it was not at all in the Gréeke copies:Hieron. Minerio & Alexand. in fine. 
                     In Graecis codicibus non haberi. The which alſo prooueth this not to be S. Hieroms tranſlation, nor that which he corrected. In the 5. of Marke, verſ. 35. and Luke 8. verſ. 49. in the Latin tranſlation thus: Veniunt ad Archiſynagogam. That is, They came to the Archſynagog: wheras it is in the Gréeke, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . That is, From the Archſynagog or ruler of the Synagog: meaning from his houſe. A like error there is in moſt of your Latin copies. Iohn 18.28. Adducunt ergo Ieſum ad Caiapham in praetorium.
                      That is, They brought Ieſus to Caiphas into the iudgement hal: where it is in the Gréek, From Caiaphas. Luke 11.52. The old Latin tranſlation is thus: Coeperunt Phariſaei & legis periti grauiter inſistere, & os eius opprimere de multis: which laſt words you tranſlate thus: To ſtop his mouth about many things. Wheras the Gréeke 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , ſignifieth, To prouoke him to ſpeak of many things, as Eraſmus out of Theophylactus and Beza do prooue, and I will héerafter more largely ſhew, as alſo the words following do plainly declare. Act. 4. verſ. 21. The ſaid Latin tranſlation is thus: Quia omnes clarificabant id quod factum fuerat, in eo quod acciderat: the which barbarous and falſe tranſlation, you fondly tranſlate thus: Bicauſe all glorified

that which had béene done, in that which was chanced. Where the Greeke is: 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . That is, For all glorified God for that which was done. 1. Cor. 6.20. The common Latin tranſlation is thus: Empti enim estis praetio magno: glorificate & portate Deum in corpore vestro, which you tranſlate in this ſort: For you are bought with a great price: glorifie and beare God in your bodie. Where you diſſent from the Gréeke, in adding this word, Beare, and in omitting all theſe words: And in your ſpirit, which are Gods. By theſe places which I haue ſet downe, to omit infinite others, it ſufficiently appéereth how true it is, that you ſay, it is ſo exact and preciſe according to the Gréeke. The falſenes of which ſhameles aſſertion may alſo ſufficiently be conuinced, by at leaſt an hundred places, where that is in the ſaid tranſlation omitted, which is extant in the Gréeke. For example ſake I will ſet downe one notorious place, where the perfect praier which our Lord Ieſus hath taught vs, is moſt miſerably mangled, and curtalled, and made imperfect. In the 11. of Luke, all theſe things be left out of that holie and heauenly praier. Firſt this word Our. Secondly, theſe words: Which art in heauen. Thirdly, theſe: Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heauen. Fourthly, theſe: But deliuer vs from euill. Thus we ſée how far this old tranſlation in this ſhort praier is from exact and preciſe following the Gréeke: and thereby plainly perceiue what braſen browes our Rhemiſh Ieſuits haue, who affirme it ſo to be, and to follow it more exactly than the Proteſtants tranſlations: wherin as they ſay moſt vntruly (as may appéere by the places before alledged, and many others which ſhall be héerafter produced) ſo I verily thinke they write it contrarie to the teſtimonie of their own conſcience. Yet to prooue this ſhameles aſſertion they alledge two examples: the one, Tit. 3.14. Curent bonis operibus praeeſſe, 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , which they ſay, we tranſlate, to maintaine good works. And I beſéech you, gentle Ieſuits, ſhew vs why it may not ſo be tranſlated? Doth not 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , and namely with a genitiue caſe, as héere S. Paul vſeth it, ſignifie to maintain?Demoſt. in Timocra. Badaeus tranſlateth it: Iura vestra tueri & defenſitare. Comment. pag. 256.
                      When Demoſthenes ſaith: 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , is it not, and ought it not to be tranſlated, to maintaine your right? And euen ſo why may not theſe words of S. Paul 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                     
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      be in like maner tranſlated, to maintaine good works? What abſurd ſenſe or falſe doctrine is in theſe words? And whereas the Latin tranſlateth it, Praeeſſe bonis operibus, and you tranſlate it to excell in good works, although I miſlike not of it, for that the ſenſe is good: yet you may know, that it is not the propertie of the Gréeke phraſe, for then it ſhould be in the datiue caſe, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , and not in the genitiue, as S. Paul twiſe héere hath it, verſ. 8. & 14. But whether it be tranſlated, to excel in good works, as you do, or to maintaine good works, as you ſay our Bibles haue it: or to ſhew foorth good works, as it is in thoſe Engliſh Teſtaments which I haue ſéene, it maketh no great matter, neither any but vaine cauillers (ſuch as our Ieſuits ſhew themſelues to be) will find ſo great fault with it. If I were diſpoſed ſo narrowly to examine the old tranſlation, I dare vndertake to find a 1000 places in the Bible more vnproperly tranſlated in Latin, than either of theſe which you alledge, is in Engliſh. But let vs come to your ſecond cauillation, where you find fault for tranſlating the Gréeke word 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , which in your Latin is Initiauit,
                     Hebr. 10.20. by this word Prepared. Our tranſlation of that place is thus: Séeing therefore brethren, that by the blood of Ieſus we may be bold to enter into the holie place by the new and liuing way, which he hath prepared for vs through the vaile, that is, his fleſh, &c. What matter is héere amiſſe, that troubleth ſo much your quiet minds? Forſooth you ſay the word, Prepared, doth not ſo exactly agrée with the Gréeke, as doth Initiauit. What then? doth the old Latin more exactly followe the Gréeke generally, if héere in this place the Latin word do more aptly expreſſe the Gréeke, than the Engliſh? that doth not follow. But if we examine the etymologie, propertie, and ſignification of the words, I cannot ſée, but our Engliſh doth as well anſwer to the Gréek as that Latin. For 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      is to renew, to make new or freſh. And although Initium do ſignifie a beginning, yet Initio doth not properly ſignifie to begin, to make new, or freſh; for that doth Innouo: but to inſtruct, to dedicate, to enter into. And therefore I ſée no cauſe why the word, Prepared, may not as well anſwer the Gréeke, as the Latin Initiauit. Sure I am it neither goeth far from the ſignification of the word, nor meaning

of the matter. But this being onely a friuolous cauill, I will omit it, being glad, that you can find no greater diſagréeing in our tranſlations from the Gréeke, than theſe.
                  And whereas you would commend the Latin for exactly following and kéeping theſe words, Iuſtifications, Traditions, Idola, &c. I anſwer, that as yet you neither haue, nor euer will be able to prooue, that our tranſlations haue not truly expreſſed the ſenſe of the Gréeke in all theſe words: ſo do ſome of them as much retaine the laſt, tranſlating 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , Idols, as doth the Latin. For whereas you miſlike that wée tranſlate the Gréeke word 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , Image, and not Idoll, doth not your Latin often tranſlate it Simulacrum, which (I pray you) what doth it elſe ſignifie but an image? As that place whereof Maſter How lets friend ſo much complaineth. 1. Iohn 5.21. 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . which in the vulgar Latin is thus: Filioli, cuſtodite vos à ſimulacris, which how is it to be tranſlated in Engliſh, but thus; Little children, kéepe your ſelues from images. For what is the Engliſh of Simulacrum, but an Image? If you ſay, Idoll, I ſay that that is rather the Gréeke of it than the Engliſh. And therfore you do nothing but wrangle and cauil, when you find fault with tranſlating of 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , Image, as I doubt not, but by others hath and will be more largely prooued. In like maner, Act. 7.41. and Apocal. 9.20. the vulgar interpretor tranſlateth the ſame word 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , Simulacrum, which doth ſignifie nothing els but an Image. And to prooue that 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      in Gréeke may be tranſlated an Image in Engliſh, it may appéere by the etimologie which Tertullian maketh of it, in theſe words: Ad hoc neceſſaria est vocabuli interpretatio,
                     Tertullianus lib. de Idolalatria. 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      
                     Graecè formam ſonat, ab eo per diminutionem 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      
                     diductam aequè apud nos formulam fecit. Igitur omnis forma vel formula idolum ſe dici expoſcit. Inde Idololatria omnis circaidolum famulatus & ſeruitus. That is, Héereunto is neceſſarie the interpretation of the word, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      in Gréeke ſignifieth a forme or image: and thereof by diminution is 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      deriued, which in like maner ſignifieth a little forme or image. Therefore euery forme requireth to be called Idolum. And thereupon Idolatrie is all that ſeruice and worſhip which is done about euerie Idoll. Doth it not héerby plainly appéere, that 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      ſignifieth the forme,

ſhape, or image of any thing, and therefore may well ſo be tranſlated:Anſwer to Greg. Martin fol. 7. as alſo my learned brother D. Fulke hath learnedly ſhewed.
               
            
            
               8. Reaſon.
               
               THe aduerſaries themſelues, namely Beza prefer it before all the reſt in Praefatione noui Teſtamenti, Ann. 1556. And againe he ſaith, that the old interpretor tranſlated very religiouſly. Annot in 1. Luc. v. 1.
               
                  Anſwer.
                  IF Maſter Beza and others thinke reuerently of the old tranſlator, they do as becommeth good and godly men to do, in accepting thankfully and in good part the labors of good men in ſo good a worke, as is the tranſlating of the bleſſed word of God, for the inſtruction and comfort of Gods people: and paſſing by, and by charitie couering ſome faults that haue eſcaped. But it is the propertie of wicked men, and enimies to Gods truth, rather to cauill and carpe, to raile at and reuile good men laboring in this ſort in Gods vineyards than either charitably to couer faults, or louingly to amend them themſelues. So S. Hierom when he was raiſed vp of God, and prouoked by Damaſus Biſhop of Rome, to tranſlate the holy Scriptures faithfully out of Hebrew & Gréeke into Latin, how was he handled of many? Forſooth railed vpon very miſerably, as in infinite places of his Prefaces and Epiſtles doth appéere.Hier. ad Domnion. et Rog. in Eſdr. & Neh. For example I will ſet downe one or two: Legite de hijs exemplaribus, quae nuper à nobis edita, maledicorum quotidie linguis confodiuntur. That is, Read thoſe copies which I haue lately ſet foorth, and are daily thruſt throw with the toongs of railers and euill ſpeakers. Againe: Sicubi ergò aeditio men à veteribus diſcreparit,
                     Hieronimus Sophro. 
                     interroga quemlibet Hebraeorum & liquidò peruidebis me ab aemulis fruſtra lacerari, qui malunt contemnere videri praeclara, quàm diſcere. That is, If my edition differ from the old, aſke any Hebrew and Iew, and thou ſhalt plainly perceiue, that I am without cauſe torne in péeces of my aduerſaries, who would rather ſéeme to deſpiſe good things, than to learne any thing. Thus

was S. Hierom for tranſlating the holy Scriptures vſed. And was not that learned man Eraſmus Roterodamus for his godly paines, in tranſlating the new Teſtament, in like maner intreated? Being railed vpon by Lea in England, by Natalis Bedda in France, by Stunica in Spaine, and infinite other vnlearned Moonks and Friers, as Eraſmus himſelfe doth declare in an Epiſtle to Moſellanus,
                     Epist. lib. 6.
                      where he ſheweth, that a Carmelite Frier being a Doctor, in a publike ſermon charged him there preſent, with ſinne againſt the holie Ghoſt, for altering ſome things in the new Teſtament, otherwiſe than was in the old tranſlation. And another cried out for the ſame cauſe, that the comming of Antichriſt was at hand. And when Eraſmus vrged him to ſhew one place in the Teſtament that did offend him: he ſaid plainly, that he had neither read nor ſéene it. And euen ſo Maſter Beza and our godly countrimen, ſuccéeding thoſe godly learned fathers, in their godly labors, be in like ſort handled by our Rhemiſh Ieſuits in this Teſtament, and by Gregorie Martin in his booke intitled A Diſcouerie, wherin he too much diſcouereth his owne folly, and the melancholie of his ſtomacke, in railing vpon them ſo rudely, or rather deſpitefully, who haue woorthily labored in bringing to light the light of Gods bleſſed word. Thus we ſée how Satan by his imps and miniſters, rageth againſt thoſe that take pains to tranſlate the holy Scripture: which is the ſword that doth foyle him, the hammer that beateth downe his houſe, the light that driueth away his darknes: which alſo conuerteth the ſoule, lighteneth the eies, reioiceth the hart,Pſal. 19. and maketh vs circumſpect in all our waies. But if they do not vnfainedly repent this their rude railing, and reuiling of Gods faithfull ſeruants, let them be aſſured, that they ſhall fall into the clawes of him that is indéed 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , a railer, a ſlanderer, and a falſe accuſer of Gods Saints.
                  As touching my iudgement of the old tranſlation of the new Teſtament, I ſay as S. Hierom ſomtime ſaid to ſuch ſuperſtitious admirers of the old tranſlation that then was, as our Romiſh Papiſts be now.Hieronimus praefa. in lib. Ioſue.
                     Quòd ſi vetus eis tantum interpretatio placet, quae & mihi non diſplicet, & nihil extra recipiendum putant, &c. That is, But if the old tranſlation onely

pleaſe them, which diſpleaſeth not me, and they thinke nothing els to be receiued, &c. Euen ſo ſay I to them now, that ſtand ſo much vpon the old tranſlation: I do not generally diſallow it, nor condemne it, although ſome faults haue béen both by the tranſlator committed, and afterwards by negligence crept into it, which are not malitiouſly to be railed at, but charitably in the feare of God to be reformed. But wheras you ſay Maſter Beza preferreth it before all the reſt in his Preface before the Teſtament, 1556. you do miſreport him: for he doth not in that Preface prefer it before all the reſt, whereof he maketh no compariſon, but onely defendeth it againſt Eraſmus in ſome places, which he thought that he found fault with it, without ſufficient cauſe. You cannot be ignorant, that Maſter Beza in that Preface affirmeth, beſides manifold faults crept in by the writers,Beza his words. it doth often diſſent from the Gréeke, interpret many things obſcurely, adde ſome things, and omit others. And wheras you further alledge, that in his Annotations vpon Luke he ſaith, the old tranſlator tranſlated very religiouſly, he did (as I haue before declared) reuerently thinke of him, who (no doubt) was a godly man, and tooke godly paines in ſetting foorth Gods holie word, to the benefit of his Church. Yet you know, that euen in that very place, Maſter Beza ſheweth ſome imperfection in him. For theſe be his words, out of which you haue culled your teſtimonie:Beza in Annotat. in Luc. v. 1. 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . 
                     Vetus autem interpres quamuis alioqui videatur ſumma religione ſacros libros interpretatus, tamen quae ſignificatio ſit horum vocabulorum non videtur cognouiſſe, ne dum vt vim illorum intellexerit. That is, But the old interpretor although otherwiſe he may ſéeme very religiouſly to haue tranſlated theſe holy bookes, yet it appéereth, that he did not know what is the ſignification of theſe words, much leſſe that he vnderſtood the force and power of them. And how iuſtly héere he findeth fault, any that is indued with any knowledge in the toongs, and not blinded with malice may plainly perceiue. Therefore, although Maſter Beza reuerently iudged of him, yet he did not thinke him to be without his faults, which are charitably to be corrected and reformed, as he doth, and not malitiouſly to be carped and reprooued, as is our Ieſuits and Greg. Martins maner. It is not

alſo to be thought, but that moſt of thoſe faults and corruptions, which be now in the text, were not committed at the firſt by the tranſlator, but haue crept in ſince, either (as S. Hierom ſaith) by negligent writers, and copiers out of the bookes: or by preſumptuous and ignorant correctors, &c. which are not to be imputed vnto him. Laſtly, I ſay the queſtion is not ſo much, which is the beſt tranſlation, or whether it be better than the reſt: but whether it is to be preferred before the originall Gréeke: which héereafter is to be diſcuſſed.
               
            
            
               9. Reaſon.
               
               IN the reſt there is ſuch diuerſitie and diſſention, and no end of reprehending one another, and tranſlating euerie man according to his fantaſie, that Luther ſaid,Cocle. cap. 11. de cano. Script. autoritate. if the world ſhould ſtand long time, we muſt receiue againe (which he thought abſurd) the decrees of Councels, for preſeruing the vnitie of faith, bicauſe of ſo diuers interpretations of the Scripture. And Beza (in the place aboue mentioned) noteth the itching ambition of his fellowe tranſlators, that had much rather diſagree and diſſent from the beſt, than ſeeme themſelues to haue ſaid or written nothing. And Bezas tranſlation it ſelfe being ſo eſteemed in our countrie, that the Geneua Engliſh Teſtaments be tranſlated according to the ſame, yet ſometime goeth ſo wide from the Greeke, and from the meaning of the holie Ghoſt, that themſelues, which proteſt to tranſlate it, dare not follow it. For example▪ Luc. 3. v. 36. they haue put theſe words: The ſonne of Cainan, which he wittingly and wilfully left out. And Act. 1.14. they ſay: With the women, agreeably to the vulgar Latin, where he ſaith: Cum vxoribus, With their wiues.
               
                  Anſwer.
                  HEre in this 9. reaſon, you complaine of the diuerſitie and diſſention of other tranſlations, by reaſon wherof, we ſhould for the preſeruing of vnitie of faith, if the world ſhould long continue, receiue the decrées of Councels,

as you imagine, and make Luther to affirme. Why? may not vnitie of faith ſtand with diuerſitie of tranſlations? There were in the primitiue Church fower ſeuerall Gréeke tranſlations of the old Teſtament. The firſt of the ſeuentie interpretors, ſecond of Simmachus, third of Aquila, fourth of Theodotion: and yet there was vnitie of faith in the true Church: or whatſoeuer diuerſitie of doctrine there was, I thinke you cannot prooue, that it came of the diuerſitie of tranſlations. There were in the Latin Church very many diuers tranſlations, as S. Auguſtine in theſe words ſheweth:August. lib. 2. de doctr. Christ. cap. 11.
                      
                     Qui enim Scripturas ex Hebraea lingua in Graecam verterint numerari poſſunt: Latini autem interpretes nullo modo. That is, For they that haue tranſlated the Scriptures out of the Hebrew toong into the Gréeke may be numbred: but the Latin tranſlators cannot. Héere you ſée that S. Auguſtine affirmeth, the Latin tranſlators of the Scriptures to haue béene ſo many, that they could not be numbred: yet he was ſo far from our Rhemiſts opinion, that they bred diuerſitie of doctrine,August. de doctr. Chriſt. lib. 2. cap. 12
                      that he thought the ſame profitable, eſpecially for them which wanted the knowledge of the originall toongs: foraſmuch as that which is obſcure in one, may be made manifeſt by another. And if there may be diuerſitie of expoſitions of one place of Scripture without breach of vnitie of doctrine, why may not ſome diuerſitie of tranſlations ſtand with vnitie of faith and doctrine? Héerof S. Auguſtine writeth thus: Quos neceſſe est etiamſi rectae atque vnius fidei fuerint,
                     August. epist. ad Hieron. 
                     varias parere in multorum locorum obſcuritate ſententias: quamuis nequdquam ipſa varietas ab eiuſdem fidei vnitate diſcordet, ſicut etiam vnus tractator ſecundum eandem fidem aliter atque aliter eundem locum potest exponere, quia hoc eius obſcuritas patitur. That is, Who muſt néedes, although they be of one true faith, bring foorth by reaſon of the obſcuritie of many places diuers opinions and iudgements: albeit the ſame diuerſitie doth nothing at all differ from the vnitie of one faith: as alſo one expounder agréeably to one faith, may diuerſly expound one place,Chryſostom. in Gen. hom. 37.
                      bicauſe that the hardnes thereof requireth the ſame. So ſaith Chryſoſtom: Talis enim Scripturae mos est, vt in paucis verbis plurima ſaepè multitudo ſenſuum inueniatur.
                      That is, Such is the maner of the Scripture, that in few words a

very great multitude of ſenſes or expoſitions may be found.
And therefore as there may be diuers expoſitions of places of the Scriptures, which may all agrée with the analogie and proportion of faith: euen ſo may there be in tranſlations diuerſitie in words and phraſes, without diſſention in doctrine, or breach of faith. I write not this, that I allow the itching ambition of ſome (of whom Maſter Beza doth iuſtly complaine) who without ſufficient knowledge in the toongs, and ſound iudgement, take ouer raſhly vpon them to tranſlate that bleſſed booke of the holy Scriptures, which ought not to be handled with vnwaſhen hands, but with all reuerence and fidelitie in the feare of God ought to be dealt in. Neither do I thinke but that it were very expedient and profitable for the Church of Chriſt, that in euery toong there were one as exact and abſolute tranſlation, as might be agréed vpon, which ſhould either onely or principally be followed. The which if it cannot be procured, I ſay that vnitie of faith may as well agrée with diuerſitie of tranſlations: as there might and would be diuerſitie of doctrine through the malice of Satan, and weaknes of mans iudgement, though there were but one onely tranſlation. And therfore I thinke you rather ſucke that out of your owne fingers, than find it in Luthers works, in ſuch ſenſe and ſort as you expreſſe it. And thereupon haue noted no place in his writings where it is to be found, but onely refer vs to a place of Coclaeus, who being a profeſſed and malitious enimie to Maſter Luther, of what weight and force his report is to be accounted, let the indifferent Reader iudge. But whereas you charge Maſter Bezas tranſlation ſo much eſtéemed of vs, to go ſo wide from the Gréeke, and meaning of the holy Ghoſt, that we dare not (as you ſay) follow it: I anſwer, that as we reuerence the man for his great gifts of learning, and woorthily eſtéeme his godly and learned labors, in tranſlating faithfully the Teſtament of Ieſus Chriſt: ſo neither he doth require, nor we iudge our ſelues to be bound in all things abſolutely without exception to follow him. He is a man and may erre, and as we thankfully to Gods glorie acknowledge that he hath euen hit the marke in many: ſo we doubt not, but he might miſſe it in ſome, and peraduenture ſo hath

done, not in ſubſtance of doctrine, but in ſome proprietie of words and phraſes. Howbeit whereas you ſo maliciouſly and falſely accuſe him to haue gone ſo far from the Gréeke, and meaning of the holy Ghoſt, let vs ſée your proofes. You alledge héere but two places: the one Luc. 3. v. 36. the leauing out of the name Cainan, which we haue put in. This is a great matter whereat you make ſuch a tragicall exclamation in your marginall note vpon that place, which is but the leauing out of one name, whereas both in the old Latin, and your owne new Engliſh, there are left out not onely words, but alſo ſentences in at leaſt an hundred places. Thus you can ſtraine a gnat, and ſwallow a camell: ſée a mote in your brothers eie, and not behold a great beame in your owne. Touching the matter it ſelfe, which concerneth neither faith nor doctrine: Maſter▪ 
                     Beza hath not without great and good cauſe omitted the ſaid name of Cainan: partly bicauſe it is not in the Hebrew, Geneſ. 11. nor in the booke of Chronicles,Geneſ. 11.12. 1. Chron. 1.18. where the ſame Genealogie is ſet out: and partly for that it is not expreſſed, but omitted in one moſt ancient Gréeke and Latin copie, that of late yéeres came to his hands, which he hath ſent to the Vniuerſitie of Cambridge there to be kept, and is there reſerued. Whereupon Maſter Beza vpon good warrant hath omitted that name. And if we had had intelligence of that ancient Gréeke and Latin copie, we would not haue doubted to haue followed him. But whether it be expreſſed or omitted, it is a matter of no great moment, and concerneth no point of doctrine. Beda hauing ſhewed, that in the veritie of the Hebrew, the name of Cainan is in both thoſe places of the old Teſtament left out, and that S. Luke alledged it (as he thought) out of the Septuaginta interpretors,Beda in Luc. 3.
                      ſtandeth in a mammering at the matter, and writeth thus: Sed quid horum ſit verius, aut ſi vtrumque verum eſſe poſſit Deus nouerit. That is, But whether of theſe readings be the truer, or whether both be true, God knoweth
                  The ſecond place wherein you charge Maſter Beza with diſagréeing from the Gréeke, and vs with diſſenting from him, is Act. 1. v. 14. He tranſlating: Cum vxoribus; With the wiues, and we according to the old Latin, With the women. Wherein you do but cauill, according to your accuſtomed

maner, and find a knot in a ruſh. Doth not the Gréeke word 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      ſignifie indifferently both a woman in reſpect of hir ſex, & a wife in reſpect of hir calling? S. Hierom can teach you this in theſe words:Hieron. lib. 1. aduerſus Iouinianum. 
                     Numquid non habemus potestatem mulieres vel vxores circumducendi (quia 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         apud Graecos vtrumque ſignificat) ſicut caeteri Apostoli & Cephas? &c. That is, Haue we not power to lead about, women or wiues (for the Gréeke word 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      doth ſignifie both) as the other Apoſtles and Cephas? &c.
Héere S. Hierom doth not only flatly affirme, that the word 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      (which S. Luke in this place, which you alledge, Act. 1.14. doth vſe) ſignifieth both a woman and wife: but alſo ſheweth, that that place of S. Paul 1. Cor. 9.5. may be tranſlated either women or wiues. And in his booke againſt Heluidius, he doth tranſlate it wiues.August. de opere Monacho. cap. 4.
                      The which alſo S. Auguſtine doth affirme, that ſom tranſlated in that place Wiues. Therefore I beſéech you, why may not this place in the Acts in like maner be tranſlated either women or wiues, without going ſo wide from the Gréeke, and meaning of the holy Ghoſt, as you complaine on? Doth your old tranſlator, tranſlating Act. 21.5. the very ſame two Gréeke words 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      (which be héer in this place vſed) Cum vxoribus, and you, with their wiues, go ſo wide from the Gréeke? Or doth Maſter Beza go wide from the Gréeke tranſlating the ſame Gréeke words, with the very ſame Latin words, as the old interpretor doth, and he néere vnto the ſame? But you will ſay,Act. 1.14. the ſenſe of this place requireth to be tranſlated Women, and not wiues: and the ſenſe of the other, Act. 21.5. Wiues, and not women. Then it followeth by your owne confeſſion, that Maſter Beza hath not gone wide from the ſignification of the word, howſoeuer he haue gone from the ſenſe of the place, and meaning of the matter. But if you examine that with an indifferent eie, there may as good reaſon be yéelded for the tranſlating of it Wiues, as Women: as appéereth by the reaſons which Eraſmus and Beza do bring. Eraſmus in his Annotations ſaith, it may be either way tranſlated, his words be theſe: Accipi potest & cum vxoribus, propterea quòd ſeparauit Mariam à mulieribus. That is, It may be taken,Eraſmus in Annotat. and with their wiues, bicauſe he did ſeparate Marie from the women. And euen ſo Maſter Beza ſaith in his Annotations,

that it may be tranſlated either Wiues or Women: but he preferred the former: bicauſe the Apoſtles wiues were to be confirmed, who partly ſhould be companions of their trauels, and partly ſhould patiently abide their abſence at home. But whether it be tranſlated Women or Wiues, it maketh no matter, the Gréeke word will indifferently beare both. God be thanked that our Rhemiſh and Romiſh Ieſuits can alledge no greater diſagréement in Bezas and our tranſlations from the Gréeke: The which may be a good and ſufficient teſtimonie, euen to the ſimple and vnlearned, of the ſoundnes and ſinceritie of them. But I am aſhamed to perſiſt any longer in confuting theſe friuolous follies and cauillations.
               
            
            
               10. Reaſon.
               
               IT is not only better than al other tranſlations, but than the Greeke text it ſelfe, in thoſe places where they do diſagree.
               
                  Anſwer.
                  THe tenth and laſt reaſon that hath mooued our Rhemiſh Runnagates to tranſlate rather out of the olde Latin than the Gréeke, is a very ſtrange paradoxe, that the vulgar Latin tranſlation, is not onely better than al other tranſlations, but than the Gréeke it ſelfe when they differ. This I count and call a ſtrange paradoxe, bicauſe it is contrarie not onely to the generall iudgement of the ancient fathers and learned writers (as héerafter ſhall appéere:) but alſo to the common courſe of all learning. For whereas in all other authors and writings, the originall languages, wherein the authors did firſt write themſelues, are preferred before all tranſlations, as in Plato, Ariſtotle, Xenophon, Demoſthenes, Homer, Galen, Euclyde, &c. and al tranſlations are examined and reformed by the ſaid originals: now by our Ieſuits new Diuinitie, onely the Teſtament of Ieſus Chriſt, written in Gréeke by his bleſſed Apoſtles, through the inſpiration of Gods holie ſpirit, muſt come behind the Latin tranſlation, tranſlated we know not when, nor by whom.

The Latin muſt not now be examined by the Gréeke (as S. Hierom, Eraſmus, and other learned men haue labored to do) but the Gréeke by the Latin: for it is, they ſay, the better; and it is méete that the woorſe be reformed by the better. Now bicauſe héere is the principall controuerſie in this matter, and héereupon depend all the diuerſities that be in the Engliſh tranſlation of the Ieſuits fetched from the Latin, and ours deriued from the Gréeke: (for if the Gréeke, wherin they cannot denie but the Apoſtles did write, be generally to be preferred before that old Latin, then ours is true, and theirs falſe: if otherwiſe the Latin be more ſound and ſincere than the Gréeke, then is theirs true, and ours falſe) let vs therefore ſomewhat more exactly examine this matter, and weigh our Rhemiſts reaſons which mooue them to broach abrode this new doctrine and ſtrange opinion. And although that which I haue ſaid, may to any reaſonable man ſéeme ſufficient, that it is contrarie to all reaſon and all learning: yet bicauſe our Ieſuits would ſéeme greatly to depend vpon the Doctors, and to carrie all their annotations, and guilefull gloſes in this Teſtament, vnder the viſor of ſome father, let vs ſée what the Latin godly and ancient fathers ſay in this matter. For to them in this point I muſt ſpecially appeale, and not to the Gréeke fathers, who followed the fountaine of the Gréeke, and medled not with tranſlations, as ſtreames flowing from it. And after I will come to other learned men, and euen ſuch as miſliked not the Romiſh religion. S. Hierom who was not onely excellently learned in the thrée learned languages, but alſo greatly occupied in tranſlating the whole Bible out of the Hebrew and Gréeke (as before appéereth) writeth thus:Hieronimus aduerſus Heluidium. 
                     Non neceſſe eſt nunc de exemplarium varietate tractare, cùm omne & veteris & nouae Scripturae instrumentum in Latinum ſermonem exinde tranſlatum ſit, & multò purior manare credenda ſit fontis vnda quàm riui. That is, I néed not now to intreat of the varietie of the copies or examples (meaning the Latin) ſéeing that the whole inſtrument of the old and new Scripture was from thence tranſlated into the Latin toong, and the water of the fountaine is thought to flow more pure than that of the riuer or ſtreame. In theſe words S. Hierom doth not onely

affirme the Latin to be tranſlated dut of the Gréeke, but alſo the Gréeke to be more pure than the Latin, as the water of the fountaine is more cleane and ſwéete than that in the ſtreame or riuer,Hieronimus ad Lucinium. according to the old true ſaying: Dulcius ex ipſo fonte bibuntur aquae. Againe, the ſame Hierom ſaith: Vt enim veterum librorū fides de Hebraeis examinanda est, ita nouorū Graeci ſermonis normam deſiderat. That is, As the truth of the books of the old Teſtament is to be examined by the Hebrew: ſo the bookes of the new Teſtament require the triall of the Gréeke.Hieronimus Suniae & Fretellae. Againe he writeth thus: Sicut autem in nouo Testamento ſi quando apud Latinos quaestio exoritur, & est inter exemplaria varietas, recurrimus ad fontem Graeci ſermonis quo nouum ſcriptum est instrumentum: ita in veteri Testamento, ſi quando inter Graecos Latinóſque diuerſitas est ad Hebraicam recurrimus veritatem: vt quicquid de fonte proficiſcitur, hoc quaeramus in riuulis. That is, As in the new Teſtament if there ariſe any queſtions among the Latins, and there be varietie among the copies, we returne vnto the fountaine of the Gréeke toong in the which the new Teſtament was written: ſo in the old Teſtament if at any time there be diuerſitie among the Greekes and Latins, we returne vnto the Hebrew veritie, that whatſoeuer floweth from the fountaine, we may ſéeke the ſame in the ſtreames. Infinite ſuch other places there be in S. Hierom both in his Prefaces, Epiſtles, and other works: and thoſe alſo which before I haue in the beginning ſet downe, do plainly declare S. Hieroms iudgement héerin, and that he thought it moſt abſurd to prefer the Latin before the Gréeke, as our Rhemiſh Ieſuits are not aſhamed for to do. Now let vs heare what S. Auguſtines opinion was, who although he were vtterly ignorant in the Hebrew▪ and as it is thought had no great knowledge in the Gréeke, writeth thus:Augustinus de ciuitate Dei, lib. 15. cap. 13.
                      
                     Ei linguae potius credatur, vnde eſt in alia per interpretes facta tranſlatio. That is, We ought rather to beléeue that toong, from the which it is by interpretation deriued into another. Againe:August. in Pſal. 38.
                      
                     Sed quia non ſunt loquelae neque ſermones quorum non audiantur voces eorum, exponit ſequentem lingua praecedens, & fit certum in alia, quod erat ambiguum in alia. That is, But bicauſe there are no languages nor toongs, where their words be not heard, the former toong expoundeth the later, and it is made

plaine in one, which was doubtfull in another. Againe:August. de doctr. Christ. lib. 2. cap. 12.
                      
                     Quis interpretum vera ſequutus ſit, niſi exemplaria linguae praecedentis legantur, incertū est? That is, Which of the interpretors hath folowed the truth, vnles the examples of the former toong be read, it is vncertaine? Againe: Libros noui Testamenti,
                     Ibid. cap. 15.
                      
                     ſi quid in Latinis varietatibus titubat, Graecis cedere oportere non est dubiū. That is, It is not to be doubted, but that the bookes of the new Teſtament, if that there be any doubt in the varieties of the Latin, ought to giue place vnto the Gréeke. The like he affirmeth, Sermone Domini in monte, lib. 1.
                     
                     August. epist. 59.
                      And in his Epiſtles he writeth thus: Secundum Graecum eloquium diſcernenda ſunt: nam nostri interpretes vix reperiuntur qui ea diligenter & ſcienter transferre curauerint. That is, Theſe words are to be diſcerned by the Gréeke toong: for we can hardly find of our tranſlators that haue béene carefull to tranſlate this exactly and cunningly. He meaneth of the diſtinguiſhing thoſe words, Praiers, Supplications, and interceſſions, 1. Tim. 2.1. And how we ought to deale when there be any varieties in the bookes and copies of the Scriptures, S. Auguſtine giueth vs this counſell:Auguſt. lib. 11. contra Faustū Manich. cap. 2
                      
                     Ita ſi de fide exemplarium quaestio verteretur, ſicut in nonnullis quae & paucae ſunt & ſacrarum literarum ſtudioſis notiſſimae ſententiarum varietates, vel ex aliarum regionum codicibus vnde ipſa doctrina commeauit, noſtra dubitatio dijudicaretur: vel ſi ibi quoque codices variarent, plures paucioribus, vel vetustiores recentioribus praeferrentur. Et ſi adhuc eſſet incerta varietas, praecedens lingua, vnde hoc interpretatum est, conſuleretur. Hoc modo quaerunt, qui quod eos mouet in Scripturis tanta autoritate firmatis inuenire volunt, vt habeant vndè instruantur, non vnde rixentur. That is, So if there be any queſtion touching the truth of the copies or examples of the Scripture, as in ſome there be varieties of ſentences, which both be few, and alſo well knowen to thoſe that be ſtudious in the holie Scripture, then our doubt is to be iudged either by the books of other countries, from whence the doctrine came vnto vs: or if there alſo the bookes differ, then the mo be to be preferred before the fewer, and the more ancient before the later. And if as yet there remaine a doubtfull varietie, the former toong, from whence it was tranſlated, ſhould be conferred with. In this ſort do they ſéeke, which would find in the holy

Scriptures, confirmed by ſo great authoritie, that which troubleth them, that they may haue wherewith they may be edified and inſtructed, and not wherewith to wrangle and raile.
This is the good counſell of that good father, the which our Rhemiſh Ieſuits not following, it ſéemeth, and by their writings it plainly appéereth, that in this edition of the Teſtament, they ſéeke rather to wrangle and raile, than either to be inſtructed themſelues,Ambroſ. de incarnat. verbi, cap. 8.
                      or to profit Gods people.
Saint Ambroſe alſo preferreth the Gréeke text in theſe words: Ita enim inuenimus in Graecis codicibus quorum potior autoritas est. That is, For ſo we find it in the Gréeke bookes, whoſe autoritie is better.
Tertullian alſo preferreth the Gréeke in theſe words:Tertullianus lib. 2. aduerſus Marcionem. 
                     In primis tenendum quod Graeca Scriptura ſignauit, afflatum nominans non ſpiritum. Quidam enim de Graeco interpretantes, non recogitata differentia, nec curata proprietate verborum pro afflatu ſpiritum ponunt, & dant haereticis occaſionem Spiritum Dei infuſſandi, id est, ipſum Deum. That is, Eſpecially we muſt hold that which the Scripture in Gréeke hath ſet downe, naming afflatum, that is, breath or wind, and not ſpirit. For ſome tranſlating from the Gréeke, and not conſidering the difference, nor regarding the propertie of the words, haue for breath put ſpirit, and giue occaſion to heretikes to attribute ſinne to the ſpirit of God, that is, to God himſelfe.
                  By theſe ſayings of theſe ancient fathers it may ſufficiently appéere, what was their iudgement concerning the originall text of the holie Scripture, and how far they were from this abſurd aſſertion of our Rhemiſh Ieſuits in preferring the troubled ſtreame of their Latin tranſlation before the pure fountaine of the Gréeke. Now I will ſet downe the iudgement of ſome later writers, and ſuch as were no aduerſaries, but fauorers of the Romiſh religion. Ludouicus Viues in his Commentaries vpon S. Auguſtine De ciuitate Dei,
                     Ludouicus Viues in Aug. de ciuitate Dei, lib. 15. cap. 13.
                      vpon thoſe words of Auguſtine before alledged:
Ei linguae potius credatur, &c. writeth thus: Hoc ipſum Hieronimus clamat, hoc ipſa docet ratio. Et nullus est ſaniore iudicio qui repugnet. Sed frustra conſenſus bonorum ingeniorum hoc cenſet. Nam rigidus ſtupor velut moles opponitur. Non quia isti inſcij ſunt earum linguarum, nam nec Hebraicè ſciebat Augustinus, & Graecè minus quàm mediocriter. Sed non est in hijs ea modestia animi quae

in Augustino. Hic vndiquaque paratus erat doceri, isti nuſquam volunt doceri, vbique docere quod ignorant. That is, This Hierom earneſtly (vz. that more credit and autoritie be giuen to the Hebrew in the old, and Gréeke in the new Teſtament, than to any tranſlations) this reaſon it ſelfe teacheth. And there is none of any ſound iudgement, that will denie the ſame. But in vaine doth the conſent of good wits thus thinke. For ſtiffe ſturdines as a bulwarke is ſet againſt it. The which they do not, bicauſe they be ignorant of thoſe toongs. For neither S. Auguſtine did vnderſtand the Hebrew any thing, and but meanly the Gréeke. But there is not in theſe men that modeſtie of mind which was in Auguſtine. He was readie and willing any waies to be taught: theſe men will neuer be taught, but will alwaies teach that which they do not vnderſtand. Hitherto Lud▪ Viues.

                     Testamentum quod vocant Nouum, &c. That is, The new Teſtament as they call it, we haue recogniſed with as great, both diligence as wée might, and faithfulnes as we ought, and that firſt according to the truth of the Gréeke, whereunto for to flie, if any doubt fall out, not onely the examples of famous Diuines do counſell vs, but alſo Hierom and Auguſtine do often bid vs, and the very decrées of the Biſhops of Rome do command vs.

               Rhemiſh Ieſuits.
               THe proofe heerof is euident, bicauſe moſt of the ancient heretikes were Grecians, and therefore the Scriptures in Greeke were more corrupted by them, as the ancient fathers often complaine.

                     LEt the good Chriſtian Reader héere conſider the deſperate dealing of the Papiſts againſt the holy Worde of God. Firſt they haue with all carefulnes and diligence kept it vnder the buſhell of a ſtrange toong, that the light thereof might not ſhine in the eies of the common people to the diſcouering of their errors, Idolatries, and mockeries. But when through the great mercie of God this light hath béene taken from vnder this buſhell, and ſet vpon a candleſtick, to giue light to al that are in Gods houſe, to the directing of their féete to walke in Gods waies: then they haue fallen to raile on it, and reprochfully to ſpeake of it. Iohn Ecchius calleth the Scripture, Euangelium nigrum & Theologiam atramentariam. That is, the blacke Goſpell, and Inken Diuinitie.Hierar. lib. 3. cap. 3 fol. 103.
                      
                     Albertus Pighius another patron of the Popes cauſe, writeth thus:
Sunt Scripturae, vt non minus verè, quàm festiuè dixit quidam, velut naſus cereus, qui ſe horſum illorſum, & in quamcunque volueris partem trahi, retrahi, fingí
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         facilè permittit. That is, The Scriptures be (as one no leſſe truly than pleaſantly ſaid) like a noſe of waxe, which maybe drawen this way, and that way, & be applied to whatſoeuer part a man will.Ludouicus citatur ab Illyrico in Nor. Concilij. One Ludouicus a canon of the Laterane church in Rome, thus ſpake in an oration in the late goodly Councell of Trident: Eccleſia est viuum pectus Christi, Scriptura

autem eſt quaſi mortuum atramentum. That is, the Church is the liuely breſt of Chriſt: but the Scripture is as it were dead inke. How contemptuouſly writeth Cardinall Hoſius of thoſe comfortable and ſwéet Pſalmes of Dauid, which be a pretious part of the holy canonicall Scripture?
For whereas it was obiected for the proofe of kings and princes power in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, that king Dauid did not onely deale in ſuch cauſes for the reſtoring and planting of Gods true worſhip and ſeruice, greatly decaied in the daies of king Saul a wicked hypocrite: but alſo did write Pſalmes, which pertaine to the canon of the Scripture, for the inſtruction and direction of Gods Church for euer: Hoſius anſwereth in theſe words:
Scripſit Dauid Pſalmos aliquot,Hoſius contra Brentium▪ lib. 2
                         
                        ſi quid Athanaſio credimus quinque tantùm. Quid ni ſcriberet? Ne nunc quidem regi prohibetur, aut principi, quominus aut rythmos, aut Pſalmos aut carmina ſcribat, quibus Dei laudes celebret. Scribimus indocti doctíque poemata paſſim.
                      That is, Dauid did write certaine Pſalmes, if we beléeue Athanaſius but fiue onely. Why might he not write? Euen now a king or prince is not prohibited to write either rimes, or Pſalmes, or verſes wherewith he may praiſe God. We write learned and vnlearned poems apace. Thus contemptuouſly writeth that popiſh prelate and preſident in that Tridentine Conuenticle of the Pſalmes, comparing them with rimes and verſes that kings may or do now write: and thereunto diſdainfully and blaſphemouſly applying that verſe of Horace the profane poet.
Beſides this contemptuous ſpeaking of the holy Scriptures, our Papiſts be now procéeded a ſtep further: in accuſing the originall texts of the Scriptures to be corrupted, the old Teſtament by the Iewes, and the New by Gréeke heretikes. Is not this deſperate dealing againſt the word of God? Firſt to ſuppreſſe it, and kéepe it in a ſtrange toong, then reprochfully to ſpeake of it, and now laſtly to accuſe the original and autenticall copies thereof to be corrupted? What can they do more vtterly to deface and diſcredit the word of God contained in the Scriptures: the which may ſéeme to be the marke they ſhoote at, that by pulling downe the credit of the holy Scriptures, they may ſet vp their owne vaine inuentions, and wicked traditions, wherewith their religion doth

much better agrée than with the Scriptures.
                  But now let vs more particularly come to the examination of this aſſertion. The proofe heerof is euident (ſay our Rhemiſh Ieſuits) bicauſe moſt of the ancient heretikes were Grecians, &c. I anſwer, that the diſproofe héerof is eaſie. For this is not the complaint as you moſt falſely affirme of ancient fathers: but a falſe ſlander of ancient wicked heretikes, as by the ancient godly fathers doth moſt plainly appéere.Hieronimus aduerſus Heluidium.
So did Heluidius as Saint Hierom ſheweth, whoſe words I may aptly apply vnto you, which be theſe: Ac nè fortè de exemplariorum veritate cauſeris: quia tibi ſtultiſſimè perſuaſisti Graecos codices eſſe falſatos: ad Ioannis Euangelium venio. That is, But leaſt peraduenture you complaine of the truth of the copies, bicauſe thou haſt moſt fooliſhly perſuaded thy ſelfe, that the Gréeke bookes be falſified, I come to the Goſpel of Iohn.
In which words you may ſée, how that you who will be worſhippers of the virgin Marie, ioine héerin hand in hand with Heluidius, whom otherwiſe you would ſéeme much to miſlike, for denying the perpetuall virginitie of hir. And as Hierom ſaid, that Heluidius was moſt fooliſhly perſuaded then, that the Gréeke bookes of the Teſtament were corrupted: Euen ſo may I ſay vnto you, that this is an extreame folly thus to iudge now, as did Heluidius then: for what reaſon is it to thinke, that the Gréeke heretikes could corrupt all the Gréeke copies in the world? Or why ſhall not we thinke, that the godly learned fathers were as carefull to kéepe them pure from corruption, as the heretikes were to corrupt them?With Rainolds. And whereas there were (as the Papiſts alſo do now) that thought the Iewes had corrupted the Hebrew in the old Teſtament,Auguſt. lib. 15. de ciuitate Dei cap. 13.
                      S. Auguſtine anſwereth thus:
Sed abſit vt prudens quiſpiam vel Iudaeos cuiuſlibet peruerſitatis at
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         malitiae tantum potuiſſe credat in codicibus tam multis & tam longè laté
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         diſperſis, vel ſeptuaginta illos memorabiles viros hoc de inuidenda gentibus veritate vnum communicaſſe conſilium. That is, But God forbid that any wiſe man ſhould beléeue that the Iewes, how peruerſe or malitious ſoeuer they were, could do ſo much as to corrupt ſo many copies, and ſo far and wide diſperſed abroad, or that thoſe woorthy men the ſeuentie interpretors did take this counſell togither to depriue

the Gentils of the truth.Lud. Viues in illa August. verba. Vpon which words of S. Auguſtine, Ludouicus Viues writeth thus: Hoc idem reſponderi potest hijs, qui falſatos corruptóſ
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         & ab Hebraeis codices veteris instrumenti, & à Graecis noui obijciunt, nè veritas ſacrorum librorum ex illis fontibus petatur. That is, This ſame may be anſwered to them, who do obiect vnto vs (as our Rhemiſh Ieſuits do now) that the bookes of the old Teſtament were corrupted and falſified by the Iewes, and the bookes of the new Teſtament by the Grecians, to the end that the truth of thoſe holy bookes might not be fetched from thoſe fountains. Thus you ſée how S. Auguſtine and Ludouicus Viues, one otherwiſe of your owne ſide, diſſent frō you in this your ſhameles aſſertion of the corruption of the Gréeke copies.
But let vs ſée what other holy fathers our holy Ieſuits haue followed, in accuſing the Gréeke copies of the Scriptures to be corrupted. Thoſe monſters the Manichées were of the ſame opinion, as appéereth by S. Auguſtine in theſe words:Auguſt. Hieronimo. epist. 19.
                     
                     Manichaei plurima diuinarum Scripturarum quibus eorum nefarius error clariſſima ſententiarum perſpicuitate conuincitur: quia in alium ſenſum detorquere non poſſunt, falſa eſſe contendunt: ita tamen vt eandem falſitatem, non ſcribentibus Apostolis tribuant, ſed neſcio quibus codicum corruptoribus. Quod tamen quia nec pluribus ſiue antiquioribus exemplaribus nec praecedentis linguae autoritate (vnde Latini libri interpretati ſunt) probare aliquando potuerunt: notiſſima omnibus veritate ſuperati confusíque diſcedunt. That is, The Manichées bicauſe they cannot writhe into another ſenſe very many places of the holie Scriptures, by the which their wicked error is by moſt plaine and euident ſentences conuinced, affirme the ſame to be falſe: yet ſo, that they attribute the ſame not to the Apoſtles which wrote them, but I know not to what others, who afterward corrupted them. The which notwithſtanding, bicauſe they cannot prooue, neither by the moſt copies, nor by the moſt ancient, nor by the autoritie of the former toong (from which the Latin books were tranſlated) they are ouercome and confounded by the truth, being made moſt manifeſt vnto all men. Theſe be the fathers, whom our Rhemiſh Ieſuits haue followed, in accuſing the Gréeke text of the Teſtament to be corrupted.
As for the godly and learned fathers, you may ſée both by theſe

places, and thoſe which I haue before alledged, how far they diſſent from them, who alwaies appealed to the Gréeke in the new Teſtament, and haue affirmed that the Latin tranſlations are to be examined and reformed by it. And whereas you ſay, moſt of the ancient heretikes were Grecians, and therefore the Scriptures in Gréeke more corrupted by them, as you ſay the ancient fathers complaine. I ſay that you haue not receiued this friuolous cauillation, and falſe accuſation from the godly ancient fathers, but (beſides thoſe heretikes whom I haue named) from the barbarous abſurd Gloſer vpon Gratians decrées, Dist. 9. cap.
                     Vt veterum: the ſumme of whoſe words you haue alledged, which I will more largely lay downe as they be there to be ſéene.Gloſſa dist. 9. cap. Vt veterum. 
                     Hieronimus in 2. prologo Bibliae contra ait dicens quòd emendatiora ſunt exemplaria Latina quàm Graeca: & Graeca quàm Hebraea. Sed Auguſtinus ad primitiuam Eccleſiam reſpicit quando exemplaria Graeca & Hebraea non erant corrupta. Sed procedente tempore cùm populus Christianus mulium eſſet auctus, & haereſes eſſent factae inter Graecos, in inuidia Christianorum Iudaei & Graeci ſua exemplaria corruperunt. Et ſic factum eſt, quòd exemplaria eorum magis corrupta ſint quàm Latinorum, ad quod tempus reſpicit Hieronimus. That is, Hierom in the ſecond prolog of the Bible ſaith the contrarie (vz. to Auguſtine) affirming the Latin copies to be more true than the Gréeke, and the Gréeke than the Hebrew. But Auguſtine ſpeaketh in reſpect of the primitiue Church, when the Gréeke and Hebrew copies were not corrupt. But in proceſſe of time, when the Chriſtian people was much increaſed, and manie hereſies ſprang among the Grecians: the Iewes and Grecians for enuie of the Chriſtians corrupted their copies. And ſo it is come to paſſe, that their copies be more corrupt than the Latins, the which time Hierom reſpecteth.
Hitherto the Gloſer: from whom it moſt plainly appéereth, that you haue borrowed this reaſon, or rather accuſation of the corruption of the Gréeke copies, which is an author fit for you to follow: who hath in theſe words deliuered almoſt as manie groſſe abſurdities and lies, as there  be lines. For firſt he maketh Auguſtine and Hierom diſſenting in iudgement: Auguſtine preferring the Gréeke and Hebrew copies, and Hierom the Latin: attributing to Auguſtine
                     
a ſentence which is not his, but Hieroms Ad Lucinium, as I haue before alledged, whoſe words againe be theſe: Vt veterum librorum fides, &c.
As the truth of the bookes of the old Teſtament is to be examined by the Hebrew bookes: ſo the truth of the new requireth the triall of the Gréeke toong.
And ſo this blind Gloſer attributing to Auguſtine a ſaying which indéed is Hieroms, maketh Hierom contrarie to himſelfe. Secondly, in alledging S. Hieroms words out of the  ſecond prolog of the Bible, and making him there to affirme the Latin copies to be more true than the Gréeke, he doth cleane peruert S. Hieroms meaning. For there in that very place he doth affirme the cleane contrarie in theſe words:Hieronimus in prologo in pentateuchum.
                     Sicubi in tranſlatione tibi videor errare, interroga Hebraeos: diuerſarum vrbium magistros conſule. Quod illi habent de Christo, tui codices non habent. Aliud est, ſi contra ſe poste à ab Apostolis vſurpata testimonia probauerunt, & emendatiora ſunt exemplaria Latina quàm Graeca, & Graeca quàm Hebraica. That is, If ſo be that I ſéeme to thée to erre in my tranſlation, aſke the Hebrewes, conſult with the Maſters of diuers cities. That which they haue of Chriſt, thy bookes haue not. It is another matter, if they haue allowed the teſtimonies afterward vſed by the Apoſtles againſt them, & that the Latin examples be more true than the Gréeke, and the Gréeke than the Hebrew.
Héere S. Hierom doth infer this as abſurd, that the Latin copies ſhould be more true than the Gréeke, and the Gréeke than the Hebrew, which the blind Gloſer our Ieſuits Maſter thought he ſimply ment. And that the reader may perceiue this more plainly, I will ſet downe ſome of Eraſmus words in his ſcholies vpon this place of Hierom:
                     Eraſmus in illum locum Hieron.
                     Hunc locum inſulſiſſime citat gloſſometarius quiſquis is fuit in decretis pontificum, dist. 9. cap. Vt veterum librorum, putans Hieronimum verè ſenſiſſe Graecorum exemplaria emendatiora eſſe quàm Hebraea, & Latina emendatiora quàm Graeca. Et hunc nodum multis modis diſſoluit, nugaciſſimè nugans in re non intellecta, vel dic, vel dic, vel dic. Tantúmne eſt istis autoritatis vt cū remprorſus nō intelligant, tamen illis ius ſit quic quid lubitū fuerit dicere? Nam Hieronimus inducit hoc velut 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , & dictu abſurdū quo magis refellat quod isti volebant. That is, This place the writer of the Gloſſe vpon the Popes decrées, Dist. 9. cap. Vt veterum librorum, whoſoeuer

he was, doth moſt abſurdly cite, ſuppoſing that Hierom did indéed thinke, that the Gréeke examples and copies were more true than the Hebrew, and the Latin more true than the Gréeke. And this knot he goeth about to loſe by manie meanes, moſt triflingly trifling in a matter that he did not vnderſtand, with his vel dic, ſay ſo, and ſay ſo, &c. Haue theſe men ſo great autoritie, that when they do not at all vnderſtand a matter, yet it ſhall be lawfall for them to vtter and write what they liſt? For Hierom doth bring in this as a thing impoſſible, and abſurd to be ſpoken, that he might the more confute that which they would infer, &c. Hitherto Eraſmus.
                  
                  
                      Thirdly, whereas this barbarous blind Gloſer maketh Auguſtine preferring the Gréeke and Hebrew copies, and Hierom the Latin, he doth very fooliſhly and prepoſterouſly.
For Hierom in all his writings, and alſo as appéered by his tranſlations, did moſt earneſtly maintaine the contrarie: whereas Auguſtine by reaſon of his ignorance in the Hebrew, did ouermuch attribute to the Septuaginta interpretors in Gréeke, and wiſhed that Hierom had tranſlated the old Teſtament rather out of them, than out of the Hebrew, as appéereth by his owne words in his Epiſtle to Hierom himſelfe,August. Hieronimo. epist. 10.
                      which be theſe: Ego ſanè te mallem Graecas potius canonicas nobis interpretari Scripturas, quae Septuaginta interpretum autoritate perhibentur. That is, I had rather that you did tranſlate vnto vs the Gréeke canonicall Scriptures, which be confirmed by the autoritie of the Seuentie interpretors.
This is that woorthy writer vpon the Popes holie Decrées, who hath taught our Rhemiſh Ieſuits this leſſon, and lent them this reaſon or rather accuſation of the holy Scriptures. A méete author for them to follow.
                  But how falſe this accuſation of the corruption of the Gréeke text is, may euidently appéere partly by the writings of Chryſoſtom, Baſill, Theophylactus, and other ancient Gréeke and godly fathers, who generally agrée with the Gréeke text, and diſſent from the Latin when they differ, as héerafter ſhall be ſhewed: and partly by thoſe places of the Latin fathers before alledged. For whereas moſt of the Gréeke heretikes were before the time of Ambroſe, Hierom
                     
and Auguſtine, as by Epiphanius it doth appéere: yet in their daies the Gréeke bookes were ſound, pure, and vndefiled. Let them therefore ſhew vs in what age, and by what heretikes all the Gréeke bookes in the world were corrupted.
                  And if our Rhemiſh Ieſuits may thinke that the Gréeke text hath béene corrupted by old Gréeke heretikes: why may it not alſo be thought, that the Latin text hath in like maner béene corrupted by Latin heretikes? But they will ſay: There were not ſo many of them as of the other: Beſides that it is not greatly materiall for the multitude, yet what if it may be prooued, that all Papiſts be heretikes, may not they in number be compared with the Gréeke heretikes? I will not enter into this diſcourſe at this preſent, and the rather for that it hath béene effectually ſhewed,In his booke againſt D. Saunders. and pithily prooued by my good and learned brother Maſter Whitakers of late: and alſo was ſo largely and learnedly handled in Quéene Maries daies, by that reuerend and learned father D. Poynet Biſhop of Wincheſter, that it hath hitherto neuer béene anſwered as far as I know: and therefore it ſhall be leſſe néedful for me to prooue it againſt M. Gregorie Martin, the ſuppoſed and reported author of theſe reaſons and this tranſlation. I will onely refer him and his fellowes vnto it: beſéeching God that it may likewiſe effectually worke in them, that they may ſée their owne errors and ignorance, and in time repent their railing againſt Gods truth and ſeruants.
                  Moreouer, I ſay that all the Ieſuits in Rhemes and Rome are not able to ſhew one ſuch a fowle corruption in al the Gréeke Teſtament, to the ouerthrowing of any article of faith, as I can ſhew a moſt notable place, concerning euen the very Deitie of Ieſus Chriſt corrupted fowly in the Latin, which our Corrupt Rhemiſts in their Engliſh haue followed. The place is 1. Timoth. 3.16. And in Gréeke thus: 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . &c. That is, And without controuerſie great is the myſterie of godlines. God was made manifeſt in the fleſh, iuſtified in the ſpirit, &c. The vulgar Latin is thus: Et manifestè magnum est pietatis ſacramentum, Quod manifestatum est in carne, &c. And is by you engliſhed thus: And manifeſtly it is a great ſacrament

of pietie, Which was manifeſted in the fleſh, &c. Héer in ſtead of theſe words: God was reuealed in the fleſh, which plainly prooue both the Deitie and Humanitie of Ieſus Chriſt, agréeably to that other place of S. Paul to the Coloſſians:Coloſs. 2.9. 
                     In him dwelleth all the fulnes of the Godhead bodily, they haue put theſe words: Which was manifeſted in the fleſh: and ſo ſéeke to depriue vs of this moſt excellent teſtimonie, which maketh ſtrongly againſt the Arrians and other heretikes, and corrupted the place which briefly, yet very pithily comprehendeth the doctrine of our redemption. The which corruption is not onely contrarie to all Gréeke copies, and the ancient Syrian tranſlation: but alſo to Chryſoſtom, to Theophylactus, to Theodoretus dialog. 1. and to the Gréeke ſcholies which ſo alledge it, and expound it. Such a place ſo like to be corrupted by heretikes, I dare ſay that all our Rhemiſh rout is not able to ſhew in al the Gréeke text.
                  Laſtly, I omit to ſhew what a wide window theſe popiſh Rhemiſts do open to all heretikes, by this their abſurd aſſertion and accuſation of the Gréeke originall text of the Teſtament, who if they be preſſed with any plaine place to the confounding of their hereſie, why may they not, as Heluidius and the Manichées of old time did, and our Iebuſites do now, ſay the ſame were corrupted by ancient heretikes. But wo be to them that cannot maintaine their doctrine but by ſuch ſhameleſſe ſhifts.
But for the further manifeſtation of this matter, and that the Chriſtian reader may ſée what conſent there is betwéene theſe Catholike fathers, I will ſet downe a place or two out of Iohn Driedon a Louanian,Lib. 2. cap. 1.
                      who writeth thus: Eiſdem argumentis vtentes, poſſumus demonstrare Graecos noui Testamenti codices non eſſe de industria vniuerſaliter falſatos, &c. That is, Vſing the ſame arguments we may prooue, that the Gréeke bookes of the new Teſtament haue not béen of purpoſe vniuerſally falſified, as though any truth had béene raſed togither out of all the holy Gréeke bookes, being diſperſed ſo far abroad, and kept in the Libraries not onely of the Grecians, but alſo of the Latins. Again the ſame Driedon of Louaine writeth thus: Quantum verò ad Nouum attinet Testamentum, veriſimile est, ſi Graeci ſuos codices noui Testamenti voluiſſent deprauare, &c. That is, But as

touching the new Teſtament, it is likely that if the Grecians would haue corrupted their bookes of the new Teſtament, they would chéefly haue done it in thoſe places, in which matters be handled, wherein they haue long agone begun to diſſent from the Latin Church: but we ſée and perceiue ſuch places to agrée with the moſt ancient Latin copies: Therefore neither any other place ought to be ſuſpected as corrupted by the common ſchoole of the Grecians. Laſtly, the ſame Driedon writeth héerof thus: Nam Scriptura ſacra ſi ſit iam olim in ſuo fonte ſuá
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         origine corrupta & deprauata, iam non erit vlla in illis canonica autoritas, &c. That is, Now if the holy Scripture haue béene long ago corrupted and depraued in hir fountaine and originall language, then there will be no canonicall authoritie in it, neither ſhall it be néedfull for Latin men to returne to the fountaine of the Gréeke toong, wherein the new Teſtament was written: or of the Hebrew, wherein the old Teſtament was ſet foorth. Hitherto Driedon.
Whereby we may ſée, to what impudencie our Rhemiſts be growen, who by this impudent aſſertion, take all canonicall autoritie from the holy Scriptures. I might ſhew what vnfaithfull kéepers of Gods holy records they haue béene: who haue héertofore bragged, that they haue kept the holie Scriptures, and whence haue we had them, but from them? And yet now of their owne accord, they confeſſe that they haue ſuffered the originall and autenticall copies of Chriſts Teſtament to be corrupted. But omitting theſe things, which might be more amplified, I come to their particular proofe of this their ſtrange paradoxe, concerning the corruption of the Gréeke text.
               
            
            
               Rhemiſh Ieſuits.
               TErtullian noteth the Greeke text which is at this day,Lib. 5. contr. Marc. 1. Cor. 15.47. to be an old corruption of Marcion the heretike, and the truth to be as in our vulgar Latin: Secundus homo de coelo coelestis: The ſecond man is from heauen heauenlie. So read other ancient fathers,Ambr. Hieron. and Eraſmus thinketh it muſt be ſo. And Caluin himſelfe followeth it, Instit. lib. 2. cap. 13. par. 2.
               
                  
                  Anſwer.
                  HEre as touching Tertullian, vpon whom doth depend the ſpeciall proofe of this pretended corruption, to ſpeake in plaine words, you make one notorious lie. For Tertullian doth not ſay, that the truth of that text is as in the vulgar Latin tranſlation, neither he in his booke De reſurrectione, doth ſo alledge it, as héereafter I will ſhew. Indéed I grant that Marcion did mangle that place, and corruptly cite it, as Tertullian in theſe words ſheweth:Tertull. aduerſus Marcionem, lib. 5.
                      
                     Primus inquit homo de humo terrenus: ſecundus Dominus de coelo. That is, The firſt man is of earth earthly: the ſecond is the Lord from heauen. Héere Marcion denying the true manhood of Chriſt, did leaue out this word Homo, that is, Man, and ſo did mangle that place, the which is not omitted, but expreſſed in all Gréeke copies. And therefore the Gréeke doth not agrée with Marcions corruption, as Gregorie Martin and his fellowes corruptly iudge.
I grant alſo that it ſéemeth Tertullian thought, that Marcion in the latter part did alledge this word Dominus, that is, Lord, which ought not: for his words after the text before alledged be theſe: Quare ſecundus ſi non homo quod & primus? aut nunquid primus Dominus ſi & ſecundus. That is, Why is he called the ſecond, if he be not man as the firſt? Or is not the firſt Lord, if the ſecond be? Héerby, I ſay, it ſéemeth, that Marcions corruption of this place, was partly in leauing out this word Homo, which is expreſſed in the Gréeke, and partly (as it ſéemeth Tertullian ſuppoſed) by putting in this word Dominus, which our Gréek copies alſo haue.
Now whether he did corruptly alledge this word Dominus, Lord, that is the queſtion.
                  
                      Firſt, I ſée no cauſe why this is to be accounted a corruption of Marcions, for that it doth no more maintaine his blaſphemous hereſie, in denying the true Humanitie of Chriſt, than doth the Latin. For how doth this, The ſecond man is the Lord from heauen, ſéeme more to fauor Marcions falſe doctrine, than the other: The ſecond man is from heauen heauenly? Why might not Marcion haue abuſed this, to prooue Chriſt to haue brought his bodie from heauen,

and not to haue taken fleſh of the virgin Marie, as well as the other? And therefore if this had béene a corruption of Marcions, he would no doubt haue otherwiſe corrupted it to the further furthering of his hereſie. Secondly, I ſay that  the Gréeke text doth not onelie as well agrée with all true doctrine as the Latin: but alſo is more pregnant in ſenſe, and more agréeable to the meaning of the Apoſtle in that place, containing a more excellent 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      and oppoſition betwéene Adam and Chriſt, than doth the Latin,In Annotat. as Maſter Beza learnedly ſheweth. Thirdly, whereas Marcion did corrupt  the 45. verſe going before (as moſt plainly appéereth by Tertullian in the ſame place) and yet the ſame corruption is not in the Gréeke, but it is pure and ſincere as it ought to be, it is not likely that this corruption ſhould any more remaine than that. Fourthly, not onely all Gréeke copies, both old  and new ſo haue it, expreſſing the word 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , that is, Lord: but alſo the Syrian and Arabian tranſlations which are very ancient, do agrée with the Gréeke. And how likely it is for ſuch a corruption of Marcions to be in all Gréeke copies, and in thoſe very ancient Syrian and Arabian tranſlations, I leaue it to the iudgement of all men to conſider. And where you ſay that other ancient fathers haue read according to the vulgar Latin: I grant that ſome Latin fathers following the old tranſlation ſo do: but Chryſoſtom, Theophylactus, the Gréeke Scholies, Damaſcenus De orthodoxa fide, lib. 3. cap. 12. (who I trow were none of Marcions diſciples) agrée with the Gréeke: And Tertullian your author alledgeth it thus: Primus homo de terra choicus, id est, limaceus, id est, Adam:
                     Tertullianus de reſurrect. carnis. 
                     ſecundus homo de coelo, id est, ſermo Dei, id est, Christus, differing from the Latin, in leauing out this word, Coelestis. So readeth both Cyprian and Hilarius: Primus homo de terrae limo:
                        Cypian. de zelo & liuore: & aduerſus Iudaeos & alios. Hilarius de Trinitate. lib. 10.
                         
                        ſecundus homo de coelo.
                      That is, The firſt man of the ſlime of the earth: the ſecond man from heauen. So that theſe thrée Latin fathers, as they differ from the Gréeke in leauing out the word Dominus, Lord: ſo do they alſo diſſent from the Latin, in leauing out the word Coelestis, Heauenly: And yet whether either of theſe words, or both of them be expreſſed or omitted, it is not repugnant to any article of faith, nor to the ſenſe of the Apoſtle. And therefore might Eraſmus be of

that opinion, to thinke it ſhould be as in the Latin: eſpecially hauing reſpect to the ſound of the oppoſition of words betwéene of earth earthly: and from heauen heauenly. And M. Caluin might ſo alledge it: And yet the Gréeke may be the true reading, wherein the Apoſtle wrote, as no doubt it is. But if I ſhould grant, that this word, Lord, crept in either by Marcions means or any others (which is vtterly vnlike, as hath béene ſhewed) yet it muſt néedes be confeſſed to be but a ſmall fault, to expreſſe this word, Lord, and to attribute it to Ieſus Chriſt, to whom it doth ſo properly appertaine: and of ſmall force to diſcredit generally the autenticall text of the Gréeke. Two hundred greater corruptions may be found in the vulgar Latin.
                  
                      Furthermore, whereas héere is produced the onely ſingle teſtimonie of Tertullian, I may iuſtly ſay: that If by the law of God one mans witnes be not ſufficient againſt a man:Deut. 19. much leſſe may it be againſt the originall copie of the Teſtament of Ieſus Chriſt. Moreouer, I may except againſt the credit of this one witnes, as vnſufficient to giue teſtimonie againſt the originall text of Chriſts Teſtament. For whereas Heluidius alledged his autoritie in defence of his opinion:
S. Hierom anſwereth him in theſe words:Hieronimus aduerſus Heluidium. 
                     Et de Tertulliano quidem nihil amplius dico, quàm eccleſiae hominem non fuiſſe. That is, And as touching Tertullian I ſay no more, but that hée was not a man of the Church.
And ſo without more ado turneth him ouer. If Hierom refuſe his credit as vnſufficient in that cauſe: ſurely we will as well reiect him in this, and not credit him in ſéeming to ſay that this word, Lord, came  into the text by Marcions meanes.Chryſostom. in Ioannem, hom. 38.
                      Laſtly, I ſay that whereas Chryſoſtom doth charge that great heretike Paulus Samoſatenus with corrupting a place, Iohn 5.27. yet notwithſtanding your vulgar Latin and your owne Engliſh do follow and allow that, which Chryſoſtom counted to haue béen corruptly read and diſtinguiſhed by the ſaid P. Samoſatenus. The like may be ſaid of Epiphanius, who thinketh a place of S. Paul, 2. Tim. 4.10. otherwiſe to be read, than either your vulgar Latin,Epiphanius lib. 2. Tom. 1. haereſ. 51.
                      or you do, whoſe words be theſe: Creſces inquit in Gallia. Non enim in Gallatia, velut quidam decepti putant, ſed in Gallia legendum est. That is, Creſces ſaith he, is gone

into Fraunce, not into Gallatia, as ſome being deceiued do thinke, but it is to be read, In Gallia, into Fraunce. Now if you will not iudge theſe places to be corrupted, although Chryſoſtom & Epiphanius did ſo thinke (who were fathers far more ſound & ſincere than Tertullian that fel into the hereſies of Montanus) why ſhall we be bound to thinke this place of the Corinthians to be corrupted by Marcion, bicauſe Tertullian ſéemeth ſo to ſay? Surely if you will not allow the iudgement of Chryſoſtom and Epiphanius in thoſe places, we wil not approoue the opinion of Tertullian in this. The which alſo may be ſaid concerning the two teſtimonies of Hierom and Socrates following, to the former whereof (hauing ſufficiently ſpoken of this) I will now come.
               
            
            
               Rhemiſh Ieſuits.
               AGaine, S. Hierom noteth that the Greeke text,Lib. 1. cont. Iou
                        •
                     
                     nia. cap. 7.
                   1. Cor. 7.33. which is at this day, is not the Apoſtolicall veritie, or true text of the Apoſtle, but that which is in the vulgar Latin: Qui cum vxore eſt, ſolicitus est quae ſunt mundi, quomodo placeat vxori & diuiſus eſt. That is, He that is with a wife is carefull of worldly things, how he may pleaſe his wife, and is diuided or diſtracted.
               
                  Anſwer.
                  HEre is brought in the onely teſtimonie of S. Hierom to diſcredit the Gréeke text, the autoritie whereof he greatly magnified, and by which he labored to reform the Latin bookes, as hath béene ſhewed. But to this ſingle teſtimonie of Hierom héere produced, I may obiect a ſaying of Hierom himſelfe, agréeable to the law of God before alledged: 
                     Vni testi nè Catoni creditum est. That is,Hieronimus aduerſus Ruffinum. lib. 2.
                      Men beléeue not one witnes, though he were Cato. And therefore both by the law of God, and ſaying of S. Hierom himſelfe, we are not bound to beléeue this ſingle witnes of Hierom, eſpecially in ſo great and weightie a matter, as is the diſcrediting of the originall text of Chriſts Teſtament.
                  Secondly, to this one teſtimonie of Hierom, I oppoſe  not onely the conſent of Gréeke copies, and thoſe ancient

tranſlations of the Syrian and Arabian, which both agrée with it: but alſo S. Baſil, who in his Morals 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . and thriſe in another booke doth ſo alledge it as it is in the Gréeke;Baſil. 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . alſo Chryſoſtom, Theophylactus, the Gréeke Scholies: Epiphanius alſo contra Hiera. haereſ. 67. and Tertullian De virginibus veland. And laſtly I oppoſe Hierom to Hierom himſelfe; who both in his booke againſt Heluidius, and alſo Ad Euſtochium de ſeruanda virginitate, doth alledge this place as it is in the Gréeke, referring the Gréeke word 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , to that which followeth, and not to that which goeth before: The which S. Hierom ought not to haue done, if he had thought it not to be the Apoſtolicall veritie. But héereby it doth appéere, that Hierom in that booke againſt Iouinian, did deale with this place,Vide ſupra pag. 3.
                      as he did with many other, which he wreſted from the ſimple ſenſe to ſerue his owne cauſe. For how Hierom in thoſe bookes abuſed certaine places of Scripture to ſerue his purpoſe, and how hardly, or rather contemptuouſly he ſpake of Matrimonie, any man of any iudgement reading the bookes, may eaſily perceiue. Whereupon it came to paſſe, that euen in thoſe daies thoſe bookes were miſliked of them that were learned and godly, as appéereth by Hieroms owne Apologies vnto Pammachius and Domnion: inſomuch that the ſaid Pammachius,
                     Hieron. epist ad Pammach. tom. 3.
                      being a godly man, and Hieroms great friend, went about to ſuppreſſe them. But leaſt I ſhould ſéeme ouer hardly to charge Hierom (whom otherwiſe I confeſſe to haue béene a godly and learned father) I wil ſet downe for a taſte two or thrée places:Hieron. li. 1. aduerſus Iouinian.
                     Bonum est, inquit, homini mulierem non tangere. Si bonum est mulierem non tangere, malum est ergò tangere. That is, It is good, ſaith he, for a man not to touch a woman, then it is euill to touch hir.
Héere Hierom doth not onely wreſt that place (for S. Paul doth not there oppoſe, Good, to ſinne and euill, but doth take it for conuenient,In Annotat. expedient and commodious, as Eraſmus ſheweth:) but alſo doth ouer iniuriouſly ſpeake of matrimonie, in ſaying it is euill to touch a woman, which God hath ordained and ſanctified.Ibidem. Againe Hierom ſaith: Si prudentia carnis inimicitia est in Deum, & qui in carne ſunt Deo placere non poſſunt: arbitror eos qui ſeruiunt officio coniugali, quòd prudentiam carnis diligant, & in carne ſint. That is, If the wiſedome of the fleſh

be enimitie againſt God, and that they which be in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God: I thinke that they which do the dutie of marriage, loue the wiſedome of the fleſh, and be in the fleſh.
How iniuriouſly Hierom héere ſpeaketh of Marriage, and how he abuſeth theſe places of S. Paul, Rom. 8. it is ſo plaine that I néed not to ſhew. S. Paul in the ſame place ſaith: Vos non estis in carne, You are not in the fleſh, but in the ſpirit: ſpeaking generally of the faithfull at Rome, of whom no doubt but many were married. Laſtly, to omit many other places hardly handled by Hierom, he writeth thus:Ibidem.
                     Quanquam & hoc pro nobis faciat. Qui enim ſemel venit ad nuptias, ſemel docuit eſſe nubendum. That is, Although this make for vs. For he that came once to a marriage, hath taught vs but once to marrie. Héere we ſée how friuolouſly Hierom would infer vpon our Sauiour Chriſts comming once to a marriage, that none ſhould but once marrie: and ſo in effect with the Montaniſts condemneth ſecond marriages, which Gods word doth plainly allow.
Now theſe things conſidered, and well weighed, whether this one witnes of Hierom not agréeing with himſelfe, and vttered in heate in that booke, wherein through an immoderate admiration of virginitie, he ſo hardly or rather contemptuouſly ſpeaketh of Matrimonie, and ſo abuſeth other places of Scripture, be ſufficient to diſcredit the Gréeke text, confirmed with the Syrian and Arabian very ancient tranſlations, with Chryſoſtom, Epiphanius, Baſil, Theophylactus, the Gréeke Scholies, let the indifferent Reader iudge. Now let vs come to the third pretended corruption, which our Ieſuits thinke they haue ſpied out in the Gréeke text.
               
            
            
               Rhemiſh Ieſuits.
               THe Eccleſiaſticall hiſtorie called the Tripartite,
                     Lib. 12. cap 4. noteth the Greeke text that now is, 1. Iohn 4.3. to be an old corruption of the ancient Greeke copies by the Neſtorian heretikes, & the true reading to be as in our vulgar Latin: Omnis ſpiritus qui ſoluit Ieſum ex Deo non est. That is, Euerie ſpirit that diſſolueth Ieſus is not of God. And Beza confeſſeth that Socrates in his Eccleſiaſticall hiſtorie readeth ſo in the Greeke, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ·
                     Lib. 7. cap, 32.
               
               
                  
                  Anſwer.
                  HEre be two witneſſes brought in to diſprooue the Gréeke text, whom they haue not far fetched: for they be brought vnto their hand, the one by Eraſmus, and the other by Beza in their Annotations. But what if theſe two in ſhew, be in ſubſtance and déede but one. I aſſure thée good Chriſtian Reader, that héere is but one witnes: for the Tripartite ſtorie being by Caſſiodorus gathered and compiled out of Socrates, Theodoretus, and Sozomenus, it is moſt certaine, that he in the ſaid ſtorie alledged this place out of Socrates: for in the other it is not to be found. And therefore of what force this one ſingle witnes of Socrates is to condemne the Gréeke text, hath béene before declared. I grant that he writeth as Maſter Beza, and our Ieſuits out of him alledge. But let vs examine the ſame: Prouided alwaies that although Eraſmus and Beza alledge, as is aforeſaid, the ſaid reading, which is in the Latin, yet neither of them do allow the ſame, but prefer that which is in the Gréeke.
                  The words of S. Iohn be theſe according to the Gréeke:
And euerie ſpirit that confeſſeth not Ieſus Chriſt to bee come in the fleſh is not of God. For the which in the vulgar Latin is that which our Ieſuits ſet downe: Et omnis ſpiritus qui ſoluit Ieſum ex Deo non est. That is, Euerie ſpirit that diſſolueth Ieſus is not of God.
Let vs now conſider whether of theſe two is more likely to be the true text of the  Apoſtle. Firſt I ſay, that the Gréeke Text in this place containeth no falſe, but very ſound and comfortable doctrine, and  therefore not very like to be a corruption of an heretike. Secondly, the Gréeke reading doth much more fitly agrée with the circumſtance of the place, and the vſual phraſe of S. Iohn, that the other.
For in the verſe before, S.Iohns words be theſe: Heereby you know the ſpirit of God. Euerie ſpirit that confeſſeth Ieſus Chriſt to be come in the fleſh is of God. 
                     And then immediately he addeth theſe words which be in queſtion: 
                     And euerie ſpirit that confeſſeth not Ieſus Chriſt to be come in the fleſh is not of God.
Where we ſée how this doth aptly anſwer to that which went before. The

which is a vſuall and common phraſe with S. Iohn, to amplifie one thing with comparing of contradictories, to imprint the ſame the more in our minds: as for example a little after in the ſame chapter, verſ. 6.
                     He that knoweth God heareth vs: He that is not of God heareth vs not. Againe, verſ. 7. Whoſoeuer loueth, is borne of God, and knoweth God: He that loueth not, knoweth not God. Againe, cap. 5. verſ. 10. He that beleeueth in the ſonne of God hath the witnes in him: Hee that beleeueth not the ſonne of God hath made him a liar, &c. Againe, verſ. 12. He that hath the ſonne hath life: He that hath not the ſonne of God hath not life, &c.
Euen after the ſame maner S. Iohn ſaith in this place:
Euerie ſpirit that confeſſeth Ieſus Chriſt to be come in the fleſh is of God: And euerie ſpirit that confeſſeth not Ieſus Chriſt to be come in the fleſh, is not of God. Thus I doubt not but euerie indifferent reader may plainly perceiue, that this doth more aptly agrée both with the ſentence before, and with S. Iohns vſuall phraſe & maner of ſpéech, than that which is in the vulgar Latin:
                     Euerie ſpirit that diſſolueth Ieſus is not of God: and ſo doth Eraſmus iudge. Moreouer, the Syrian tranſlation doth agrée  with the Gréeke. Cyprian doth ſo cite it as Eraſmus ſheweth: Theodoritus doth ſo alledge it:In Annot. Theod. dialogo 1.
                      
                     Oecumenius the Gréek Scholiaſt ſo hath it. Theſe fathers I truſt our Ieſuits will not count to haue béene Neſtorian heretikes. Laſtly, beſides  that héere is but one onely witnes, the vnſufficiencie▪ whereof I haue before ſufficiently ſhewed, what if this witnes be alreadie branded in the face by our Ieſuits own déer friends, as a falſe witnes, and not ſufficient to beare witnes in a matter of ſuch importance. For whereas we alledge both out of the ſaid Socrates,
                     Socrates lib. 1. cap. 11. & Sozom. lib. 1. cap. 23.
                      and alſo Sozomenus the ſaying of that godly father and conſtant confeſſor Paphnutius in defence of Eccleſiaſticall mens marriage: Alanus Copus one of our Ieſuits déere brethren, or as it is gathered now by certaine letters, Maſter Harpſfield a bird of the ſame neſt, in the doughtie dialog written by the one, and ſet out by the other, writeth thus:Copus dialogo pag. 154.
                     
                     Mihi neſcio quo modo in dubium venit fides huius historiae de Paphnutio. Sunt enim quae ſuſpicionem important, eam eſſe Arianorum, aut impudicorum hominum commentum. Tota

enim haec res à Socrate pendet, & Sozomene: quorum alter Nouatianus fuit: alter Theodorum Mopſuestenſem à quinta Synodo damnatum magnis laudibus extulit.That is, I know not how the truth of this ſtorie of Paphnutius ſéemeth to me to be doubtfull. For there be matters, which cauſe me to ſuſpect it to be a fained fable of the Arian heretikes, or of ſome vnchaſt perſons. For the whole matter dependeth vpon Socrates and Sozomenus: of whom one was a Nouatian heretike: the other greatly commended Theodorus of Mopſueſta being condemned in the fift Councell.
Héere M. Cope or Harpſfield make Socrates and Sozomenus both heretikes, and filthie vnchaſt perſons, and therefore labour to diſcredit them as not ſufficient to beare witnes in that matter of Paphnutius:
                     
                        
                           〈◊〉
                         Socrates. And yet ſhall our Rhemiſh and Romiſh Ieſuits ſo much aduance his credit now, thereby to diſcredit the autenticall and originall copies of the word of God? Surely if that matter of Paphnutius may not ſtand with them in the mouth of thoſe two witneſſes, then this matter which tendeth to the diſcrediting of the Gréeke text of the Teſtament, ſhall not be confirmed to vs in the words of one of them. And if they refuſe him as vnſufficient in that: we will not admit him for ſufficient in this.
                  Theſe thrée be the onely places which our Rhemiſh Ieſuits with all their conference and diligence haue piked out of the old writers, to diſcredit the Gréeke text of Chriſts Teſtament, and to conuince it of corruption: the which whether I haue not ſufficiently anſwered and diſcharged it of that ſhameles ſlander, let the indifferent reader vprightly in the feare of God iudge.
                  I haue procéeded no further in anſwering the reſt of that Preface, partly bicauſe I had not any long vſe of that Teſtament, being lent vnto me for a very ſhort time by a noble perſonage: by means whereof I did write out that which I haue héere anſwered: and partly for that I doubt not, but this and the reſt will ſhortly be more fully and effectually anſwered by others, to the ſhame and confuſion of them that write it, and all their adherents. God confound al errors, and giue frée paſſage in all places to his holy truth, Amen. Amen.
                  
               
            
         
         
            
            A diſcouerie of Corruptions in the Engliſh new TESTAMENT ſet foorth by the Papiſts at Rhemes: diuided into three parts.
            
               
                  1. The first of ſuch places as be diuers, or contrarie to the Greeke.
               
                  2. The ſecond of ſuch places wherein words and ſentences be omitted, which be expreſſed in the Greeke.
               
                  3. The third of ſuch places wherein be ſuperfluities, vz. words and ſentences which do abound, and be not in the Greeke. In all which the Greeke text is approoued and iustified, by the teſtimonies, 1. of ancient tranſlations in the Syrian toong, and in ſome bookes the Arabian: 2. of ancient godlie fathers of Christs Church: and lastly of ſome ancient Latin copies alledged by Eraſmus and Hentenius a Louanian Doctor.
            
            WHere let the good Chriſtian Reader conſider, whether the Gréeke text, wherin they cannot denie, but the Apoſtles of Chriſt by the inſpiration of Gods Spirit did write, being compaſſed with ſuch a cloud of ſufficient witneſſes, be to be preferred and followed, or the ſtreame of the Latin tranſlation, troubled with the filthie féete of many vncleane beaſts, which haue waded in it, in tranſcribing and writing it out: Remembring withal and diligently marking this woorthie ſaying of S. Hierom to Heluidius:
               Hieronimus aduerſ. Heluidium.
               Licet tu mira impudentia haec in Graecis codicibus falſata contendas, quae, &c. Although thou with maruellous impudencie doſt earneſtly affirme theſe things to be falſified in the Gréeke books, which not onely all the Gréeke expounders in a maner haue left in their works: but alſo ſome of the Latins haue ſo vſed them, as they be in the Gréeke. Neither néede I now to intreat of the varietie of the examples, ſéeing the whole inſtrument of the old and new Scripture was from thence tranſlated into the Latin language, and the water of the fountaine is to be thought to run more pure than that of the riuer. Hitherto S. Hierom, who withall woundeth our Rhemiſts, which be not aſhamed with no leſſe impudencie to affirme theſe places in the Gréeke bookes to be corrupted, being confirmed generally with the Gréeke writers; and ſomtimes the Latin.
            I do not lay downe theſe places at large: but of many produce a few, that by them the godly Reader may iudge of the reſt, and of the whole worke.
            
               
               The firſt part of diuerſities and contradictions betweene the Greeke text and the Engliſh Rhemiſh.
               HEre I do firſt ſet downe the tranſlation which is in the Ieſuits Engliſh Rhemiſh Teſtament: Then, either the Gréeke, or that which is agréeable to it. Laſtly, I prooue the Gréeke to be true, and ſo the Rhemiſh and Romiſh tranſlation falſe by the teſtimonie of very ancient tranſlations, of the old Doctors, and ſomtime by ancient Latin copies, as is beforeſaid.

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   doth not here ſignifie to ſtop the mouth: for that doth

                   ſignifie, as appeareth in S. Paul Tit. 1.11.
                   But it ſignifieth to prouoke to ſpeake, or often to aſke, as Eraſmus doth largly & learnedly prooue, and namely out of Theophylactus, who doth expound the ſaid Gréeke word 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   thus:

                  . that is, often to aſke: and ſo the words folowing in the Euangeliſt doo plainely prooue, which be theſe: Liyng in waite for him, and ſeeking to catch ſome thing of his mouth, whereby they might accuſe him. For they that would catch ſomething from ons mouth to accuſe him, will rather prouoke him to ſpeake of many things, whereby they may take aduantage in ſome, than to ſtop his mouth from ſpeaking any thing.

                  . My father which hath giuen (them) me, is greater than all. Héereunto agréeth the Syrian tranſlation, Chryſoſtom, Theophylactus, and Nonnus.

Hierom ſaith well: Neque enim ſi quid Scriptorum est errore mutatum,

The which good counſell if our Rhemiſts had followed, they would neuer haue maintained this, which a blinde man with his fingers may féele to be a corruption. The which they do alledging in their margent, Ambroſe and Auguſtine for defence of it. But Eraſmus in his annotations vpon this place, and diuers others doth ſhew, that ſuch as haue written out and copied the Latin fathers finding them alledging places of Scripture otherwiſe than was in the vulgar Latin which they vſed, haue altered ſuch places, and written them in the fathers booke as it was in the ſaid tranſlation: And namely in this place Eraſmus ſheweth by the ſenſe, that Auguſtine did read Si and non Sic, as the Ieſuits would haue him, and ſome fooliſh writer hath made him. Let the learned Reader read Eraſmus vpon this place: and thereby he ſhall plainely perceiue what corrupt Cauillers our Rhemiſh Ieſuits ſhew themſelues to be.

In the Latin tranſlation which our Rhemiſts follow be thrée faults. Firſt, the changing of this word Addebat, that is, he added, into this word augebat, that is, he increaſed. Which was by

the negligence and ignorance of ſome writer, and not of the interpretor, as Eraſmus thinketh. Secondly, the omitting this word Church, which is in all Gréeke copies, in Chryſoſtom, in the Arabian tranſlation, and in ſenſe in the Syrian. Thirdly, in putting this, in idipſum, that is, togither, to that which went before, whereas it pertaineth to that which followeth, as plainly appéereth by Chryſoſtom, who with that 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , that is, in idipſum, beginneth a new chapter, and ſo do the Gréeke bookes, the Syrian and Arabian tranſlations. Oecumenius alſo the Gréeke ſcholiaſt printed at Verona in all points agréeth with the Gréeke.

Note alſo what a fooliſh and néedleſſe repetition is in this Rhemiſh tranſlation in theſe words: That which had beene done,

Héere firſt our Rhemiſts haue fondly ſet downe the Latin word Depoſitum, whereby is vnderſtood the graces and gifts of Gods ſpirit committed to Timothie for the profit of Gods Church. Secondly, they vntruly tranſlate, following their corrupt Latin, Noueltie of voices, whereas it is in the Gréeke

And the ſenſe of the place ſo requireth it: for he deſireth Philemon to receiue Oneſimus (whom he had woon vnto Ieſus Chriſt) not now as a ſeruant, which he had béene before, but aboue a ſeruant, a beloued brother ſpecially to me, ſaith he, how much more then vnto thée, &c.

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , that is, thoſe that come (or go) vnto God by him. So is the Syrian tranſlation, ſo read Chryſoſtom, Theophylactus, and Euthymius. Eraſmus ſheweth that the moſt ancient Latin books had not accedens, but accedentes, that is, them that come. And Hentenius the Louanian doctor affirmeth in 8. of his copies to haue béen accedentes. And ſo the ſenſe of the place requireth. Yet notwithſtanding al this, that which is a manifeſt and groſſe corruption kéepeth poſſeſſion in the text, when the true reading is forced to ſtand without the doore in the margent. So againe in the 9. chap. verſ. 14. they haue thruſt the true reading agréeable to the Gréeke confirmed by the Syrian tranſlation, Chryſoſtom, and the Gréeke ſcholies into the margent: which alſo Hentenius ſheweth to haue béene in 7. of his copies, emundabit, ſhall clenſe:

ſtrength to conceiue ſéed, and paſt the time of age did beare a childe, bicauſe, &c. Héere firſt they haue theſe words, Being barren, which are not in the Gréeke. Secondly they haue fooliſhly and falſely tranſlated this: receiued vertue in conceiuing of ſeed. For, receiued ſtrength to conceiue ſeed. For although the Latin word Virtus do ſomtimes ſignifie power and ſtrength, and anſwereth to the Gréeke word 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   which is héere vſed: yet in our Engliſh this word Vertue is not ſo vſed, but onely anſwereth to the other Gréeke word 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . But more abſurdly in the 18. of the Apoca. v. 3. they tranſlate thus: Rich by the vertue of hir delicacies, Grae.
                   
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

Iohn ſpeaketh? Thirdly, they haue omitted this, bare a childe, which is in the Gréeke, wherevnto agrée Chryſoſtom, Theophylactus and the Gréeke ſcholies.

                  . that is, God is delighted, or well pleaſed. Héere for the maintenance of their Merits, they tranſlate, promerited: wheras the Gréeke word ſignifieth to pleaſe or delight. And that God is pleaſed with the good works of his children is confeſſed: but that they merit and deſerue any thing, that is (by reaſon of the corruption and imperfection of them) denied: with the Gréeke agrée the Syrian tranſlation, Chryſoſtom, and the Gréeke ſcholies. I omit to ſhew how obſcurely and vnproperly they vſe theſe words, Beneficence, Communication, and Hoſts, the former two, for liberalitie and almes, the laſt for ſacrifices. Where Communication is improperly vſed for almes: for that in our Engliſh toong it is vſed for conference of ſpéech, and not for diſtribution of almes. That ſentence we tranſlate thus: To do good & to diſtribute forget not: for with ſuch ſacrifices God is pleaſed. Let the godlie and learned reader conſider whether is the truer, apter, and plainer tranſlation.

                  , that is, behold how great wood a little fire kindleth or burneth. In the margent they haue put this word, Little, which agréeth with the Gréeke, and is confirmed by the Syrian tranſlation, by S. Hierom, who vpon the 66. chapter of Eſaie thus citeth this place: Paruus ignis quàm grandem ſuccendit materiam, that is, a little fire what a great deale of wood or matter it burneth. Beda alſo ſheweth, that in ſome copies it was written, modicus ignis, that is, a little fire. The ſenſe and circumſtance of the place, and compariſon which the Apoſtle vſeth, requireth it to be ſo: that as a little fire burneth a great deale of ſtuffe, ſo the toong being but a little member braggeth of great things, and doth much miſchiefe. Eraſmus doth probably coniecture, that the interpretor did tranſlate it, Quantulus ignis, the which an ignorant or negligent writer did alter into Quantus: and now by preſcription the corruption poſſeſſeth the text, and the true reading is thruſt out into the margent.

                     which the Ieſuits in their Latin tranſlation of the Engliſh Teſtament haue without need vſed, as it may ſeeme for theſe cauſes:

                           First, to ſhew their fine eloquence, and thereby to mooue their ſimple readers and hearers to admire them, who commonly haue in admiration ſuch ſtrange things as they do not vnderstand.
                           Secondly, to make the Scripture darke, and hard to be vnderſtood of the vnlearned people, and ſo to depriue them of that profit and comfort which they might receiue by it.
                           And laſtly, for that they would as much diſſent, and as little agree with vs, as they might.

               WHereas I did not purpoſe to make a full anſweare to the Rhemiſts whole preface, which I hope hereafter will be performed by ſome other: I haue thought good to ſet downe here a few places out of the holy ſcriptures, and ancient godly fathers, partly to oppoſe for an anſweare to the first part of their ſaid preface, wherein they goe about to ſhew, that it is neither neceſſarie nor profitable to haue the holy Scriptures in Vulgar languages to be read and heard of all people: and partly to ſtir vp them that be godly and faithfull, to the dayly diligent and reuerent reading of them, that they may thereby dayly more and more increaſe in the true knowledge and feare of God. If thou good Christian reader receiue any benefite and comfort by theſe my poore and ſimple labors, commend me to God in thy faithfull praiers.

               Certaine places of Scripture, to ſhew how requiſite and profitable it is, for all men diligently and reuerently to read and heare the word of GOD.

                     HEare, O Iſraell, the Lord our God is Lord only. And thou ſhalt loue the Lord thy God with al thine hart, and with all thy ſoule, and with all thy might. And theſe words which I command thée this day, ſhall be in thine hart, and thou ſhalt rehearſe them continually vnto thy children, and ſhalt talke of them when thou tarieſt in thine houſe, and as thou walkeſt by the way, and when thou lieſt downe, and when thou riſeſt vp. And thou ſhalt binde them for a ſigne vpon thine hand, and they ſhal be

as frontlets betwéene thine eies. Alſo thou ſhalt write them vpon the poſts of thine houſe, and vpon thy gates.
               
               
                  Deut. 17.18.
                  And when the king ſhall ſit vpon the throne of his kingdome, then ſhall he write him this Law repeated in a booke by the prieſts of the Leuites. And it ſhall be with him, and he ſhall read therein all the daies of his life, that he may learne to feare the Lord his God, and to kéepe all the words of this Law, and theſe ordinances for to do them. That his hart be not lifted vp aboue his brethren, and that he turne not from the commandement, to the right hand or to the left, but that he may prolong his daies in his kingdome, He and his ſonnes in the middeſt of Iſraell.

                  Let not this booke of the Law depart out of thy mouth, but meditate therein day and night, that thou maiſt obſerue and doo according to all that is written therein. For then ſhalt thou make thy way proſperous, and then ſhalt thou haue good ſucceſſe.

                  Pſalm. 19.7.
                  The Law of the Lord is perfect conuerting the ſoule: the teſtimonie of the Lord is ſure, and giueth wiſedome vnto the Simple. The ſtatutes of the Lord are right and reioice the hart: the commandement of the Lord is pure, and giueth light vnto the eies. The feare of Lord is cleane and endureth for euer: the iudgements of the Lord are truth: they are righteous altogither, & more to be deſired than gold: ſwéeter alſo than hony, and the hony combe. Moreouer by them is thy ſeruant made circumſpect, and in kéeping of them there is great reward.

For the whole Scripture is giuen by inſpiration of God, and is profitable to teach, to improue, to correct, and to inſtruct in righteouſnes, that the man of God may be abſolute, being made perfect vnto all good works.

                        THerfore I doo often foreſhew you manie daies before the Argument wherof I will intreat, that on the daies which be betwixt, you taking the booke, and weying & conſidering the ſum of the matter, after you vnderſtand what hath alreadie béene ſaid, and what remaineth to be ſaid, you may the better prepare your mind to heare that which after ſhall be intreated of. Therfore I doo alwaies exhort you, and will not ceaſe to exhort you, that you would not onelie marke the things which are héere ſpoken, but alſo when you are in your houſes, you would continually giue your ſelues to the reading of the holie ſcriptures. The which thing I ceaſe not to inculcate and beat into them who priuatlie haue companie with me. Neither let anie man ſaie to me (for they be cold and vaine words, and ought altogither to be contemned) I am troubled with worldlie matters, I haue in hand publike affaires, I exerciſe an Art and occupation, I haue a wife and bring vp children, I haue care of familie, I am a worldlie man, it is not my duetie to read the ſcriptures: but theirs who haue left the world, who dwell in the toppe of the mountaines and lead ſuch a continent life. What ſaieſt thou O man? is it not thy part to read and ſtudy the ſcriptures, becauſe thou art troubled with manie cares? yea it rather belongeth to thée than to them: for they doo not ſo much néed the helpe & defence of the ſcriptures as you doo, who are toſſed as it were in the middeſt of the waues of worldlie affaires. For ſolitarie men being frée from the court and courtlie cauſes, hauing their cottages in the wilderneſſe, and kéeping companie with none, but in that quietneſſe with much ſecuritie doo liue a ſtudious and diuine life, and as it were reſting on the hauen, doo liue verie

ſafelie: But we on the contrarie part toſſed as it were on the middeſt of the ſea, and falling will we nill we, into ſundrie ſinnes, haue alwaies néed of continuall ſolace and comfort of the ſcriptures. They ſit far from the conflict, and therefore receiue not manie wounds: But thou that ſtandeſt alwaies in the front of the battle, and receiueſt manie ſtrokes, haſt more néed of remedie. For as much as thy wife prouoketh thée, thy ſonne gréeueth thée, and mooueth thée to anger, thy enimie laieth wait for thée, thy friend enuieth thée, thy neighbour contendeth with thée, thy fellow ſupplanteth thée, the iudge often threateneth thée, pouertie troubleth thée, the loſſe of ſome of thy familie maketh thée to lament, proſperitie puffeth thée vp, and aduerſitie beateth and preſſeth thée downe: Bréefelie ſéeing that ſundrie occaſions, yea and neceſſities of cares, troubles, ſorrow, vexations, & feare doo on euerie ſide compaſſe thée, and innumerable darts doo on euerie part flie vpon thée, thou haſt néed continuallie to receiue armor from the holie ſcriptures.Eccleſ. 9. Know therefore that thou art in the middeſt of ſnares, and walkeſt on the pinacles of the citie: for the concupiſcence, of the fleſh doo more vehementlie and ſharpelie inuad them which liue in the continuall companie of the people: whom both the faire face, and bewtifull bodie by the eies catcheth, & filthie talke with artificiall & ſwéet ſongs by the eares mooueth, and manie times ouercommeth. But what doo I ſpeake of theſe things? That which is more vile than anie of theſe, euen the odour of ointments, which ſmelleth from wicked women liuing in ſtewes and ſéeking filthie lucre often inueigleth many, & leadeth them captiue. Séeing therfore there be ſo manie things that doo aſſault our ſoules, we ſtand the more in néed of thoſe diuine remedies, that we may both heale the wounds receiued, & repell thoſe that afterward ſhall be inflicted, and by the continual reading of the ſcriptures extinguiſh the fiery darts of the diuell. For it cannot be, I ſaie it cannot be, that anie man can obtaine ſaluation although we be continuallie partakers of this diuine medicine. But if we be dailie wounded, and be deſtitute of remedie, what hope can we haue of life or ſaluation. Dooſt thou not ſée Ironſmithes, Goldſmithes, and Siluerſmithes, and all thoſe that occupie anie handie craft,

how they alwaies haue readie & kéepe whole all the inſtruments of their art, although famine pinch them, and pouertie afflict them, rather deſiring to ſuſtaine anie aduerſitie, than to ſell anie of the inſtruments of their occupation, and by the monie thereof to be nouriſhed: Yea and many times they will rather take vpon vſurie, than put in pawne and pledge the ſmalleſt of their tooles, and this they doo not without iuſt cauſe: for they know that if they be ſold, their art is altogither vnprofitable to them, and that the ſubſtance of their profit is loſt: but if they retaine and kéepe them, it may be that by exerciſing continuallie their occupation, at the laſt by progreſſe of time they may diſcharge their debt. But if they doo ſell their inſtruments to other before their debt be diſcharged, there remaineth no meanes to helpe their hunger, and eaſe their pouertie. Euen after the ſame ſort ought we to be minded and affected: for as the hammer, the puntch and the tongs, are inſtruments to them, ſo the books of the Apoſtles and Prophets and all the holie Scripture which commeth by diuine inſpiration, & is verie profitable, are inſtruments to vs. And as they by thoſe their inſtruments doo worke and finiſh that which they take in hand: euen ſo we alſo by theſe our inſtruments doo forme and frame our ſoule, and when it is depraued, we amend it, and when it is corrupted, we correct and renew it. And they herein onelie doo vſe their art to adde a forme to things, for they cannot alter and change the matter and ſubſtance of veſſels, as to make Gold of Siluer, but they doo onlie make the forme and faſhion of things. But thou maiſt not onlie doo that, but more to: for thou maiſt of a wodden at the laſt make a golden veſſel, as Paul witneſſeth, writing in this manner, 2. Tim. 2. In a great houſe are not onelie veſſels of gold and of ſiluer, but alſo of wood and of earth, ſome for honor, and ſome for diſhonor. If a man purge him from theſe, he ſhall be a veſſell vnto honor, ſanctified and made méete for the Lord, and prepared vnto all good works. Therefore let vs not neglect to prepare and get vs thoſe diuine bookes, leſt we in things touching our life be wounded. Neither let vs hide and dig gold in the ground for vs, but let vs hide to our ſelues the treaſures of thoſe ſpirituall bookes. Indéed gold when it moſt increaſeth,

it moſt deceiueth them that poſſeſſe it: but theſe diuine bookes being repoſed and kept doo greatlie profit thoſe that haue them. For euen as where the kings armor and munition is repoſed and laid, although there be none that haue the ouerſight of it, yet it cauſeth much ſafetie & defence to them that dwell there, whileſt neither open théefe, nor priuie piker, nor anie wicked perſon dare aſſault the houſe: euen ſo whereſoeuer thoſe ſpirituall bookes be, from thence all diuelliſh power is expelled, and to them that dwell there much comfort and conſolation is added. For euen the verie ſight of thoſe bookes maketh vs more ſlacke and ſlouthfull to ſinne, for whether we haue attempted anie thing which is prohibited and forbidden vs, and therewith haue polluted our ſelues, whē we returne home, & behold thoſe holie bookes, our conſcience dooth more ſharplie condemne vs, and we are therby warned and admoniſhed from committing the ſame againe: or whether we perſiſt in holines we are made by thoſe books more firme and conſtant: for aſſoone as one hath touched the Goſpell, by and by he frameth his minde, and withdraweth it from worldly matters, and that onely by the ſight thereof. But if diligent reading be ioined thereto, the ſoule being occupied in thoſe holy and diuine myſteries, is purged and purified, for as much as God ſpeaketh to it by the Scriptures. But what then (ſay they) if we vnderſtand not the matters which are conteined in the ſcriptures? Yes verily although thou vnderſtand not that which is ſecret and obſcure, yet euen by the reading thou maiſt get much godlines: and yet it cannot be that thou ſhouldeſt equally and alike be ignorant of all. For the gracious ſpirit of God hath ſo diſpoſed and tempered the Scriptures, that euen publicanes, fiſhers, tentmakers, ſhepheards, apoſtles, and ſimple and vnlearned men might by them be ſaued, that no ſimple or vnlearned man ſhould flie to this excuſe of difficultie and hardnes, ſéeing that the thing which in thoſe diuine books be vttered, are ſo eaſie for all men, that euen craftſmen, ſeruants, women, and thoſe that be moſt void of learning may not a little profit euen by the hearing of them read. For they whom God from the beginning vouchſafed to indue with his ſpirit of grace, did not write and compoſe

theſe books for vaine glory as did the ethnicks, but for the ſaluation of thoſe which ſhould heare them. For thoſe prophane Philoſophers, eloquent Orators, and fine Rhetoritians, when they did write books, did not ſéeke what was moſt for the publike profit of the people: but onely had a regard héereto and ſtudied for this, euen to be in admiration, and therefore albeit they vttered any thing that was profitable, yet they did couer and hide it in the darknes of their wiſdom which they much vſed. But the Apoſtles and Prophets did al things contrary, for they vttered things in cleare and manifeſt maner, and opened them to all men, being as it were the common teachers of the world, that euery man might learne the things that are ſet foorth by the onely reading thereof. And this the prophet foreſhewed before ſaieng, They all ſhall be taught of God,Ierem. 31. & euery one ſhall not ſay to to his neighbor, know God, for al ſhal know me frō the leaſt of them to the greateſt of them. And S. Paul ſaith, 1. Cor. 2. And I brethren when I came to you, came not in gloriouſnes of words or of wiſdom, ſhewing to you the myſteries of God. And againe: My words and preaching were not in the faire inticing ſpéech of mans wiſedome: but in the plaine euidence of ſpirituall power. And againe: We ſpeake (ſaith he) the wiſedome not of this world, nor of the princes of this world, which come to naught. To whom are not manifeſt the things that be written in the Goſpell? Who hearing bleſſed be the milde, bleſſed be the mercifull, bleſſed be the cleane in hart, and ſuch other ſaiengs, will require therin to be inſtructed, or to haue the ſame expounded? Alſo to whom be not ſignes, myracles and hiſtories plaine and manifeſt? This is but a vaine pretence, excuſe and cloke or couer of ſlothfulnes. Thou doeſt not vnderſtand the things that are conteined in the Scriptures? How canſt thou euer vnderſtand them, when as thou wilt not once vouchſafe lightly to looke vpon them? Take the booke into thy hands, read the whole ſtorie, and kéeping in memorie the things which thou vnderſtandeſt, often reuolue and read ouer the things which be obſcure and hard. But if thou cannot by continuance of reading attaine to the ſenſe and meaning of it, come to a wiſe man, go to a learned man, and communicate with them the

things which thou haſt read, ſhew them thy vehement deſire and flagrant affection. And if God do ſée thée hauing ſo willing a minde, and ſo deſirous an affection, he wil not neglect thy vigilancie and carefulnes. But though no man ſhould teach thée that which thou ſéekeſt, he without doubt will open it to thée.Act. 8. Remember the Quéene of Ethiopians chamberlaine, who being a Barbarian, and diſtracted with many cares, & on euery ſide troubled with ſundry affaires, although he did not vnderſtād what he did read, yet neuertheleſſe he ſitting in his chariot did read the diuine Scriptures. If he ſhewed ſuch diligēce laboring by the way: cōſider what he would do being in his houſe? If in his iourney he would not ceaſe or abſtaine from reading, much leſſe would he refraine being quiet in his houſe. If ſo be whileſt he was ignorant, & did not vnderſtand, yet notwithſtanding did read, and ceaſed not from reading, much leſſe would he ceaſe after he was inſtructed and did vnderſtand. For that thou maieſt know that he vnderſtood not what he did read, heare what Philip ſaid to him: Doſt thou vnderſtand what thou readeſt? The which whē he heard, he was not abaſhed nor aſhamed, but confeſſed his ignorance, and ſaid: How can I, vnleſſe I haue an inſtructor, whileſt as yet he had none to teach him, yet notwithſtanding he did read, and thereby quickly obtained an inſtructor. God ſéeing his willing mind, embraced his good affection, and ſtraight waies ſent him a teacher. And although Phillip be not now with vs, yet the ſame ſpirit which moued Phillip, is with vs. Dearely beloued, let vs not neglect our ſaluation, al theſe things were written to put vs in remembrance, whom the ends of the world are come vpon. The reading of the ſcriptures is a great defence and ſafegard againſt ſin: the ignorance of the Scriptures is a verie ſlippery meanes to fall into ſinne, and a great gulfe of ſinne. It is a great perdition and deſtruction to ſaluation to be ignorant of the diuine Scriptures: this thing hath bred hereſies, brought in corrupt life, and hath turned all things vpſide downe. It cannot be, I ſay it cannot be, that any man which giueth himſelfe to the dayly and diligent reading of the Scriptures, ſhould depart without fruit. Hitherto Chryſoſtom in that place.

                     LEt vs not pretend the gouernment of our houſe, the care of wife and children: that we ſhould thinke the ſame ſufficient to excuſe our negligent and idle life. Neither let vs alledge thoſe cold and friuolous ſpéeches, in ſaying I am a worldly man, I haue a wife and care of children, as many men vſe to ſpeake, if at any time we exhort them to vertuous exerciſes, or to beſtow ſtudie and diligence in reading the holy Scriptures. Then they ſay, That pertaineth not to me. Haue I forſaken the world? Am I a monke or a ſolitarie man? What ſaieſt thou O man? Doth it onely pertaine to ſolitary men, to pleaſe God? He will haue all men to be ſaued, and to come to the knowledge of the truth, and that no man neglect vertue.

                        I beſéech you therefore let vs not deceiue our ſelues, but the more we be intangled with ſuch cares, let vs the more diligently ſéek remedies by the reading of the holy Scriptures.
                  
                  A little after.
WHerefore I beſéech you, let vs not lightly run ouer thoſe things which be contained in the holie Scriptures, but attentiuely let vs read them, that attaining profit by them, at the laſt we may giue our ſelues to vertue wherewith God is pleaſed.
                  
               
               
                  
                     Chryſostom in Geneſ. Homil. 29.
                     
                     YOu haue ſéene how whatſoeuer calamitie afflicteth our humane nature, we may take a conuenient remedie for the ſame out of the Scriptures, and repell all the cares and griefes of this life, and not be grieued with any that ſhall happen. Therefore I beſéech you that often times you would come hither, and diligently harken to the reading

of the holy Scripture, and not onely when you come hither, but alſo at home in your houſes, take the holy Bible into your hands, and with earneſt ſtudie ſéeke to get the profit which is contained in it. For from thence great gaine is gotten. Firſt by reading the toong and ſpéech is reformed. Moreouer the ſoule getting thereby wings is lifted vp on hie, and is lightened with the beames of the Sunne of righteouſnes, and during that time being deliuered from the inticements of filthy thoughts, enioyeth great quietnes and tranquillity. Moreouer that which ſenſible meat doth to the increaſing of the ſtrength of the body, the ſame doth reading vnto the ſoule. For it is a ſpirituall foode, and maketh the ſoule ſtrong and conſtant, and giuen to the loue of wiſedome: not permitting it to be ouercome of abſurde affections: but making it light, and by wings cauſeth it to flie (as it is ſaid) into the verie heauen. Therefore I pray you let vs not through negligence looſe ſo great gaine and profite: but euen in our houſes let vs giue our ſelues to the reading of the holy Scriptures. And when we be héere preſent, let vs not ſpend the time in trifles and vnprofitable talke. But to the ende that we be come togither, let vs marke diligently thoſe things that be read, that hauing gotten great profit we may depart.
                  
               
               
                  
                     Chryſostom vpon Geneſ. homil. 35.
                     
                     BEloued the reading of the holie Scriptures is a great good thing. For this maketh the ſoule endued with good maners, this lifteth the minde into heauen, this maketh a man thankfull. This cauſeth vs not to looke vpon any thing that is preſent, but to haue our minds alwaies vpon another life: and that looking to the Lords reward we ſhould do all things, and chéerefully take in hand vertuous exerciſes. Out of the Scriptures we may learne the prouidence of God quickly helping vs, the valiantnes of iuſt men, the goodnes of our Lord, the greatnes of his rewards. From hence we may be ſtirred to the imitation and following of the good life of godly men, that we waxe not cold and careles in vertuous exerciſes and battels, but euen before they come vpon vs to put our confidence in Gods promiſes. Therefore

let vs giue our ſelues with great diligence to the reading of the diuine Scriptures. For ſo we get knowledge, if we read continually the things which be there contained. Neither can it be, that he who with great ſtudie & feruent deſire giueth himſelf to the reading of the holy Scriptures, ſhould be alwais neglected, but albeit we want the inſtructiō of man, the Lord himſelfe from an high entring into our harts, lighteneth our mind, illuminateth our vnderſtanding, reuealeth thoſe things which be ſecret, & teacheth vs the things which we do not vnderſtand if we of our ſelues will do our owne endeuor. For you ſhall not, ſaith he, call any man maſter vpon earth. Therefore when we take that ſpirituall booke into our hands, all worldly care laid aſide, let vs kéepe our cogitations, and reſtraining our minde that it be not caried away, let vs with good deuotion and great attention giue our ſelues to reading, that we may by the holie Ghoſt be lead vnto the vnderſtanding of the things that be written, and receiue great profit therby. That Barbarian an eunuch to the Quéen of the Ethiopians, who was in ſo great glorie, and did ride in his coach, yet in that time neglected not reading: but hauing the prophet in his hand, vſed great diligence, and that not knowing what was contained therein, yet he did his indeuor, and vſed ſtudie, willingnes, and attentiuenes. Conſider I pray you, how diligent he was in not neglecting to read as he was trauelling in his iourney, and eſpecially ſitting in his coach. Let them heare and marke this example, who cannot be perſwaded to do this at home in their houſes, but thinke the reading of theſe things to be ſuperfluous, bicauſe they either liue in marriage, or be appointed to warfare, or haue care of children, ſeruants and other affaires, and therefore thinke that the reading of the holie Scriptures doth not appertaine vnto them. Behold this Eunuch, &c.
                  
                  A little after.
WHerupon he did not ſpeake thoſe things, which now manie men doo, ſaieng, I doo not vnderſtand thoſe things that be written, and I cannot attaine to the profound déepeneſſe of the Scriptures. Whie ſhould I in vaine take

paines and trouble my ſelfe, I read and haue none to direct me? That Eunuch did thinke no ſuch thing, being in toong a Barbarian, but in mind a Philoſopher. But rather he thought he ſhould not be neglected but helped with grace from aboue, if he did his owne indeuour, and vſed ſtudie and diligence. Therefore our gratious Lord ſéeing his deſire, did not forſake him, neither did let him want his helpe, but ſtraightwaies ſent a teacher vnto him.

YOu ſée what great profit the diligent reading of the holy Scriptures bringeth.
                  
                  A little after.
LEt vs not therefore, I beſéech you, neglect the reading of the Scriptures. But whether we vnderſtand the things therein contained or vnderſtand them not, neuertheleſſe let vs be earneſt in reading: for continuall meditation doth not a little confirme the memorie: neither ſeldome doth it come to paſſe, that that which we reading could not to day find out, to morrow reading the ſame ouer againe, we doo quickly and plentifullie perceiue it, God of his mercie ſecreatly inſpiring it into our minds.

                     BVt this gréeueth me and euen tormenteth me, and maketh me to mourne, that all men doo not know this man (Paul) as they ought to doo: but manie be ſo ignorant of him, that they doo not well know the number of his Epiſtles. And this commeth not by the fault of ignorance, but bicauſe it liketh them not continuallie to talke with this bleſſed man.

ANd you if you would giue your ſelues to reading with chéerefulneſſe and attentiueneſſe, you ſhould haue néed

of no other teacher. For the word of Chriſt is true, when he ſaith: ſéeke and you ſhall find, knocke and it ſhall be opened vnto you.

HEnce innumerable euils haue ſprong, in that men be ignorant of the Scriptures. Hence hath come that great plague of hereſies, hence procéedeth diſſolutneſſe of life and vnprofitable labours. For as they that be depriued of this outward light, cannot walke rightlie: ſo they that looke not to the beames of the holie Scripture muſt néeds often and much offend in that they walke in farre woorſe darkneſſe, the which that it happen not to vs, let vs open our eies to the brightneſſe of the Apoſtles words: For his toong in cléereneſſe excéeded the ſunne, and in the deliuerance of doctrine he excelled all others.
Infinit ſuch other earneſt exhortations for all men to read the holie Scriptures might be alledged out of Saint Chryſoſtom, who of all other was moſt earneſt and vehement in this point: but theſe ſhall ſuffice, both to ſtirre vp the godlie to this holie and fruitfull exerciſe: and to conuince the vanitie of our Rhemiſts, and their fooliſh cauillations,In their Preface. who ſaie that he ſpake theſe things not as a teacher in ſchoole, making exact and generall rules to be obſerued in all places and times, but as a pulpit man, agréeable to that audience, and his peoples default, who were delicat, dull, worldlie, & much giuen to dice, cards, ſtage plaies, and theaters, &c.
What vaine cauils theſe be, let the Chriſtian reader indifferentlie iudge. And ſéeing all the children of Adam through the corruption of their ſinfull nature, be ſubiect to the like vanities, vices, and maladies as that people of Conſtantinople were, they ſtand in néed of the ſame remedies, and preſeruatiues of reading, and knowing the holie Scriptures, which Chryſoſtom as a good Phiſition preſcribed. And for the further teſtifieng of this truth, and conuincing of the vanitie and follie of our Rhemiſts, I will ad a few moo places out of the other ancient and godlie fathers of Chriſts Church,

SObrietie with earneſt praier, and continuall meditation of the Scriptures is a moſt ſafe defence of the hart. For al holy Scripture giuen by diuine inſpiration is profitable to teach, to improoue, to correct and to inſtruct in righteouſnes, that the man of God may be perfect, and inſtructed to euerie good worke. Out of it therefore we muſt gather ſentences, which we may alwaies haue at hand and in readines, that by them we may beat downe the ſerpent lifting vp his head againſt vs. For there is no diſeaſe of the ſoule, wherunto the holie Scripture doth not miniſter a preſent remedie. Hence we muſt get examples of godly men, eſpecially of Chriſt, wherewith euerie one may either incourage, or comfort himſelfe.

And the Hebrew books be tranſlated, not onely into the Gréeke, but alſo into the Romane, Aegyptian, Perſian, Indian, Armenian, Scithian, and Slauoi, and in a word, into all toongs which the nations vſe vnto this day.

Neither thoſe men onely which dwell in cities, but alſo huſbandmen, doo well vnderſtand the ſame. One may find ditchers, and heardmen, and planters of vines diſputing of the trinitie and of the creation of all things, and hauing better knowledge of the nature of man, than Plato and Ariſtotle had.

The reading of the holie Scriptures is verie neceſſarie for vs. For by reading we learne what we ſhould doo, what we ſhould beware of, and whither we ſhould go. Herevpon it is ſaid, Thy word is a light vnto my feete. By reading our iudgement and vnderſtanding is increaſed: Reading inſtructeth & prepareth vs to praier and to good works: Reading frameth vs both to actiue and contemplatiue life. Therefore it is ſaid in the Pſalme: Bleſſed is the man that ſhall meditate in the law of the Lord day and night. Reading and praier be weapons wherewith the diuell is vanquiſhed, and inſtruments whereby eternall bleſſedneſſe is obtained. By praier & reading vices be forſaken, and vertues be noriſhed in our ſoules. Therfore beloued ſiſter in Chriſt, vſe much to read and daylie to meditate in the law. Reading with-holdeth our life from error, draweth a man from the vanitie of the world, by reading our vnderſtanding & iudgement doo increaſe. For Reading teacheth thée what thou ſhouldeſt doo, admoniſheth thée what to auoid, and ſheweth thée whither thou ſhouldeſt go: thou dooſt greatly profit when thou readeſt, if thou doo the things which thou readeſt.

Therefore we muſt beléeue the Scriptures, and not apparitions from the dead.
