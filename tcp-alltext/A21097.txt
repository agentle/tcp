Thus whet-on I did conſent, and doe preſent vnto your worſhip theſe Muſicall inuentions of mine, not as did the Philoſopher his booke of Iuſtice vnto Antigonus, that delighted in oppreſſion (an vnmeete Patron for ſo ſweet and neceſſarie a ſubiect); but as to one addicted to the Muſes ſtudious of all good Sciences, excelling in vertue; delighting in Muſick; with-all, deſiring your Protection and Pardon: Protection of theſe my labours, the firſt fruits of my weake ſtudies againſt deprauers; Pardon for publiſhing them ſo boldlie vnder your worſhips name: which if I finde (whereof I doubt not) then ſhall I bee encouraged with more alacritie, both to proceed as I haue now begun, and to prepare my ſelfe to ſome greater task. And ſo I humblie take my leaue, wiſhing all manner good, both vnto your worſhip, and all yours.

Thus whet-on I did conſent, and doe preſent vnto your worſhip theſe Muſicall inuentions of mine, not as did the Philoſopher his booke of Iuſtice vnto Antigonus, that delighted in oppreſſion (an vnmeete Patron for ſo ſweet and neceſſarie a ſubiect); but as to one addicted to the Muſes ſtudious of all good Sciences, excelling in vertue; delighting in Muſick; with-all, deſiring your Protection and Pardon: Protection of theſe my labours, the firſt fruits of my weake ſtudies againſt deprauers; Pardon for publiſhing them ſo boldlie vnder your worſhips name: which if I finde (whereof I doubt not) then ſhall I bee encouraged with more alacritie, both to proceed as I haue now begun, and to prepare my ſelfe to ſome greater task. And ſo I humblie take my leaue, wiſhing all manner good, both vnto your worſhip, and all yours.
