               There hartes ware ſo toted in the popes lawes
               They begane the laſte yere when they ſlew bodye
               All England reioyſethe at ther ouer throwſe
               For only the Lorde is oure Kynges victorye
            
            
               They had falce prophetes which brought thiges to paſſe
               Cleane contrary to ther owne expectacion
               Ther hope was for helpe in ther popiſhe maſſe
               They wolde nedes haue hanged vp a reſeruacion
               The vicare of pon wdſtoke with his coūgeraciō
               
               Commaned them to ſticke to ther Idolatry
               They had muche prouiſion and great preperacion
               Yet God hath gyuen our Kynge the victorye
            
            
               They did tobe and ſpoule al the Kynges frendes
               They called them heritekes with ſpight & diſdayne
               They roffled a ſpace lyke titante? and Findes
               They put ſome in preſon & ſume to greate payne
               And ſume fled a waie or elſe they had bene ſlayne
               As was Wyllam hilling that marcer truly
               Whiche they killed at ſandford mowre in the playne
               Where yet god hath giuen oure Kynge the victory
               They Came to plūmo with the Kynges trnſtty towne
