                     SIR, many and great are the Priuiledges of the Faithful, and farre more excellent then any, which either are, or can be granted by any mortall Monarch whatſoeuer.
                  For firſt, they were Ephe. 1. 
                     elected of almightie God freely from all eternity to be partakers of his grace in this world, and to be inueſted with immortall glory in the world to come.
                  Secondly, when they had reuolted from God, and were become the vaſſals of the Diuel, Ephe. 2. 
                     dead in ſinnes, and the children of wrath, God in

                     recall and gather them,

and redeemed them from their ſeruitude with the Per. 1.19 Reu. 5.9 
                     bloud of his owne and only ſonne Chriſt Ieſus, who was 2. Cor. 5 21. 
                     made ſinne for vs, that wee might be made the righteouſnes of God in him, aſsuming our iniquitie to himſelfe, and imputing his righteouſneſſe vnto vs. Chryſ. in

                     Act. 20.28. 
                     God, by the bloud of the ſonne of God, who was Rom. 9 5.

breath of life,1 Cor. 6.11 the ſpirit of ſanctification, who doth reforme, purge and alter them, ruinating the curſed workes of the Diuell, and repairing, rectifying, and adorning them by grace with goodnes.
                  Fourthly, Heb. 1.6 God doth (when hee pleaſeth) bath them in the waters of ſorrow, and try them in the furnace of affliction, to correct and clenſe them, & that his graces in them may appeare more freſh and ſhining, as flowers doe in a ſhower, or as the Moone doth in the night.
                  Finally the Rom. 2.78. 2. Cor. 5.1. 2. Tim. 8. Lord will one day tranſlate them out of the wide and wast Wildernes of this wicked and wofull World, and will ſafely bring them into celestiall Canaan, where they ſhall liue for euer with him in ful freedome from all euill, and in perpetuall fruition of all felecity, ſo that as nothing ſhal be found in Hell, which ſhalbe deſired, ſo nothing ſhal be deſired

in Heauen, which ſhall not be found.

and ſees his whole eſtate to ſinke before his eyes.
               Now the more excellent and commodious a thing is, the more worthy it is of our knowledge. Therefore it is diſcommendable and vncomely for any man to bee ignorant of himſelfe, and of the cauſes, the meanes and maner of his eternall ſaluation, and redemption from horrible and intolerable miſerie.
               To further this knowledge, my purpoſe is, out of the Scriptures, and by the helpe of ſundry learned and orthodoxall Writers, briefly to treat of Gods Election, and the Execution of it: and ſo we ſhal (as in a Glaſſe) behold, what courſe the Lord hath in his wiſedome taken to manifeſt his grace vnto vs▪ and to make vs partakers of his glory.
               Before I ſhew what election is, I thinke it not amiſ

                  e. 1. To ſhew the ſignifications of the word, becauſe it is ambiguous. 2. To proue that there is an Election. 3. And that the doctrine thereof ought to bee learned. 4. As alſo to ſhew that it ought to be

preached to the people. 5. and in what maner.
               For the firſt; this word Election (or Chuſing) hath fiue ſignifications.Luke 6.13.
               
               Firſt it ſignifies the chuſing and aſſuming of a man to ſome worke or office. So Saul was choſen to bee a King and Iudas to be an Apoſtle:Iohn 6.70 and of this Election is that ſpeech of Chriſt to bee vnderſtood; Haue not I choſen you twelue, and one of you is a Diuil?

For this election was temporall in part, and but a Remnant in compariſon were elected as touching that eternall decree of life.

               Firſt by expreſſe teſtimonies of holy Scripture.Matth. 20 15. Iohn 13.1

               Secondly, the Scripture ſheweth that there is a Reprobation; therefore, vnleſſe wee ſhall ſay that all are reprobates we muſt needs grant an electiō.
               Thirdly, the Scripture ſetteth forth vnto vs the cauſe, the perpetuitie, the benefits and tokens of it: which were to no purpoſe if there were no election at all.

               Hauing now prooued that there is an Election, I come in the third place to prooue the neceſſitie of learning & vnderſtanding this doctrine; which I will do with theſe two reaſons. The firſt is this.

                        raed. Theſ. 1.
               
               That doctrine ought to bee learned, which ſerues to declare Gods glorie.
               But the doctrine of election doth manifeſt the glory of God. For firſt, it ſheweth that we are elected to the honour of God, and to the praiſe of his glorious grace. Secondly, it argues and illuſtrates his eſſentiall properties, as his omnipotencie, omniſcience, eternity, mercy. Thirdly, this doctrine doth both demonſtrate and defend the free grace of God againſt all contrariant hereſies and errors, and will arme vs againſt many impetuous enemies of the truth; therefore it is a doctrine worthy to be learned.
               Secondly, that Doctrine is neceſſarily

to bee learned, which is profitable to vs in the courſe of Chriſtianity: but the doctrine of election will auaile vs much in the running of this race. For firſt, it releiues our faith againſt diffidence, ſhewing that our ſaluation hangs not like a Meteour in the ayre, but is firmely fixed vpon the loue of God in Chriſt. Secondly, it furthereth our Spirituall ioy, in that it teacheth that the loue of God is Constant,
                  Ier. 31.3. & 32▪40. 2. Tim. 2.19 and his decree concerning our welfare is Eternall. Thirdly, it eclipſeth the pride of the heart, ſhewing that Gods dignation, and not mans dignitie, his fauour & not mans faith, his mercie and not mans merit is the fountaine and foundation of mans felicitie.
               Fourthly, it prouokes vs to true gratitude and the practiſe of all good works:Tit. 3.5. becauſe it teacheth to aſcribe our ſaluation wholly to the grace of God,Eph. 1.4 and not to our owne goodneſſe: as alſo that wee were elected to bee holy, and not to follow the ſwinge of the fleſh, and to goe a whoring after our owne luſts. Fiftly, this doctrine

miniſters comfort to vs, and helpes our pacience in aduerſitie.Rom. 8.
                        ••
                     
                   For it teacheth that wee are predeſtinated to weare the crowne of thornes with Chriſt, as well as the crowne of glory: and that, as wee are couered with the grace of God as with a Canopy, whiles wee liue in this world, ſo wee ſhal be honoured with immortall glory in the world to come; therefore this doctrine ought to be learned and remembred.
               Fourthly, it is fit for Miniſters to acquaint their people with this doctrine. The reaſons are theſe.Polanus & 
                        ••
                     rmius de praed. Firſt Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and ſome of the olde Prophets haue commended this doctrine vnto the Church, and did teach it the people. But it were grieuous ſacriledge to depriue the poore people of that, which GOD doth vouchſafe them; and tranſcendent impietie to denie the preaching of that in the Church, which God doth teach in his word for the good of the Church. For whatſoeuer is written in the word,Rom. 
                        •
                     5.4 
                  it is written for our learning, that through the conſolation of

the Scripture we might haue hope.
               
               
                  Matth. 28. Mark. 16.Secondly, the Goſpell ought to be preached vnto all, both learned and vnlearned: but the doctrine of Election is a principall part of the Goſpel; yea the whole Goſpell is incloſed within the 
                     •
                  oſome of this doctrine, if we reſpect both the decree it ſelfe, and the execution and accompliſhment of it together: therefore it ought to bee promulged and made 
                     〈…〉
                   vnto all.
               Thirdly, this doctrine is very vſefull and ſolatious, and may be applyed to many notable purpoſes. For it ſhewes vs the true cauſes of all our happineſſe. Secondly, it confuteth the Pelagians, who aſcribe ſaluation to mens owne ſtrength and merits: and vtterly ouerturneth the opinion of Election for works, or faith foreſeen. Thirdly, it ſerues to correct the courſe of thoſe that hinder their owne happineſſe by their preſumption, diffidence, incredulity, prophaneneſſe, ſenſuality, and other irregular and irreligeous courſes. Fourthly, it proues the deity of Chriſt. For in that hee

hath elected vs vnto life,Polan. ibid we conclude that he is very God. Fiftly, as it teſtifieth the loue of God vnto vs: ſo likewiſe it ſerues to enflame vs with loue towards him. For who would not loue him, of whom hee is ſo loued and to whom hee is ſo much obliged? And to omit many vſes which might be made of this doctrine, it ſhewes the great power and authoritie that God hath ouer men, in making choiſe of whom hee list to bee his veſſels of honour, and temples for his Spirit to inhabit. And finally it teacheth vs to loue our brethren, who are elected by the ſame God, and for the ſame ends that we our ſelues are.
               Fourthly, Miniſters are by Pauls example bound to teach their people the whole counſell of God, and to keepe backe nothing which is commodious:Act. 10. therefore they muſt teach them this doctrine. Laſtly, Miniſters muſt not ſuppreſſe or keepe backe that which is reuealed, but rather proclaime and diuulge it.Deut. 29.9. For things reuealed (as this is) belong to vs and to our children for euer, as Moſes writeth. Yea, they ought

to do it the more diligently, that they may preſerue them frō thoſe infectious errors, which many turbulent and erroneous ſpirits doe publiſh to the world, and ſtay them from abuſing this ſo holy a doctrine (as many doe) to licentious & luxurious liuing.

                  vntill we bee acquainted with his eternall Election. The Scripture is the Schoole of the holy Ghoſt, wherein as nothing is omitted neceſſarie to be knowen, ſo nothing is taught, but that which is expedient for a man to know. We muſt therefore beware that we do not keepe the faithfull from that which the Scripture deliuereth concerning Predestination, le

               The fift and laſt thing to be conſidered, is the maner of propounding and handling of this doctrine. Here

theſe duties muſt be obſerued. Firſt, that this doctrine bee deriued onely from the word of God, and not fetcht from the forge of mans braine.Caluin. ibid. For the word is a ſure Rule to direct our vnderſtanding. And it is the cheifeſt point of ſobrietie to make GOD our Schoole-master when we learne, and then to leaue learning, when he leaues teaching. When he leaues ſpeaking, then wee ſhould leaue inquiring. Hee which curiouſly pries into Gods ſecrets, runnes himſelfe into an inextricable labyrinth, and findes not that wherewith his curioſitie may be ſatisfied.
               Secondly, this doctrine ought to bee deliuered in conuenient and fit tearmes, that the trueth thereof may be diſcerned, and no point obſcured, and that the ſublimitie and maieſtie thereof be not eclipſed and debaſed.
               Thirdly, it is fit that before this doctrine be preached to the people, the Miniſter do firſt acquaint them with more familiar points of Religion, that his labours may be more proſperous and beneficiall. Theſe things haue beene deliuered by way of a Preface.

                  ELECTION to euerlaſting life is the ſpeciall decree of God touching the conferring of eternall ſaluation by Chriſt the Redeemer, to certain men,
                  Perk de praed. 
                  of meere mercie and good will. Or, The degree of Election is that, whereby God hath appointed ſome vnto his glorious grace, in the obtaining of their ſaluation and celeſtiall life by Christ.
                  
                     Aug. de fide ad P. cap. 35. Or it is (as Auguſtine teacheth) the preparation of a free donation, whereby God hath made vs veſſels of mercie before the

creation of the world, vnto the adoption of the ſonnes of God by Ieſus Chriſt.

               In the decree of Election there are two distinct preordinations, or acts of the diuine counſell; the former concerning the end, the latter concerning the meanes tending vnto the end.
               This the holy Ghoſt ſeemeth to haue taught moſt clearely, Rom, 9.11. where he ſaith; That the purpoſe which is according to Election, might remaine firme. By which we ſee a diſtinction put betwixt the purpoſe of God & his election. And in Rom. 8.29, 30. The decree is expreſly diſtinguiſhed from the execution of it, which the Apoſtle placeth in vocation, iuſtification and glorification.
               
                  The firſt act in the decree of Election is a part of the diuine purpoſe,

                  whereby God doth aſſume certaine men to be created (paſsing by all other,) vnto his euerlaſting loue and fauour, and by aſſuming them doth make them veſſels of mercy and honour.
               
               The ſecond act is the purpoſe of ſauing or of conferring glorie; whereby God doth ordaine and ſeparate the

ſame men being to fall in Adam, vnto ſaluation and celeſtiall glory.
               Theſe two acts muſt not be ſeuered, but diſtinguiſhed. The former is of men to be created, and the latter is of men, that are both created and corrupted. By the former, men are ordained vnto grace: and by the latter, the meanes are ſubordained, whereby grace may be conferred and declared. For this latter prepares a way for the complement and execution of the former.

                        . Aug. or the Electour is God Almightie, Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghoſt For ſuch workes, as are wrought by God vpon the creature, are common to the three perſons, the maner of working peculiar to each of them being reſerued. And the Scripture expreſly ſheweth that the Father & the Sonne did elect vs, Eph. 1.4. Iohn 15.16. For howſoeuer Chriſt himſelfe is elected,
                  Iſ. 42.1. Matth. 12.18 1. Pet. 1.20. as hee is our Mediatour, yet as hee is the eternall Word or Sonne of the Father, he doth elect as well as the Father. Now ſeeing the worke of election belong

to them,1. Iohn 5.7 we may not exclude the holy Ghoſt, who hath one common Godhead with them.
               The cauſe which mooued God to elect thoſe which are elected, was his meere good will, and nothing els, as appeareth by theſe reaſons.
               Firſt by the word of God.Ephe. 1.5 
                  Hee hath (ſaith Paul) predeſtinated vs according to the good pleaſure of his will.
                  Rom. 11.5 
                  At this time alſo a reſeruation is made according to the election of grace.
               
               Secondly, if Chriſt did not merite as he was a man, to bee vnited to the perſon of the word, and to bee borne wholy voyd of ſin, there is no cauſe for vs to thinke but that our election vnto life is of the free grace of God. But Auguſtine doth confidently and moſt truely teach,
                     Tom. 7. lib. 7 de prae. C 15 that the man-head of Chriſt was thus aduanced for no merit of worke thereof, but freely had it. Therefore it is abſurde to thinke that we were not elected of Gods free grace.

Hierome alſo ſpeaking of Iacob and Eſau ſaith, that the election of the one and the reiection of the other, doth not demonſtate their merits, but the will of the Elector and reiector: and further alſo confeſſeth that it is in the power and will of God to elect or reiect a man, without good or euill workes.

                     . as theſe arguments enſuing will ſufficiently prooue vnto vs. Firſt, God is the primarie and principall authour of all his actions. Now the ſupreame and firſt ground or author, depends of no externall ground or beginner. But God ſhould depend of an externall ground, if hee could not elect whom he would, vnleſſe faith did mooue him. Secondly, euery cauſe is before the effect: now Faith is alter Election, as the Holy Ghoſt ſheweth when hee ſayth: So many as were ordained to eternall life beleeued. It was well ſayd of one, Christ firſt apprehends vs: and this apprehenſion of his workes in vs the apprehenſion of faith, whereby we lay hold vppon him. Faith is a meane, which tends to the end, wherunto the elect are ordained. Wherefore ſeeing that Election muſt needs be before the end, it muſt alſo bee before Faith, which is a meane leading to the end. Thirdly, faith is not the cauſe of vocation and iuſtification, moouing God to call and iuſtifie, therfore it is no impulſiue cauſe

of election. For

                  is the cauſe of the thing cauſed. If faith then were the cauſe of Election, it ſhould be alſo the cauſe of vocation which is an effect thereof. But it is not ſo, as the Apoſtle teacheth, Tit. 5.
                     •
                  . Laſtly, the Scripture no where ſaith, that we are elected for fore-ſeen faith. What reaſon then haue wee to beleeue it? Wee conclude therefore that wee are not elected for faith: and with Iuſtine Marti

                     ram: not becauſe I was faithfull, as Auguſtine ſpeaketh.
               Secondly, we are not elected for any fore-ſeene workes. For firſt the Apoſtle excludes all workes, from being the cauſes either of election or of reprobation

                  Rom. 9.11, 12. And teacheth that Election is not in him that runneth, that is, it is not to be attributed to his induſtrie or indeauours. Secondly, good workes can merite nothing of God, becauſe he is the author of them, and they are due vnto him, and are not equiualent and proportionable to his grace. Thirdly, we are elected that we ſhould be holy,
                  Ephe. 1.4. and ſhould doe good works; & therefore it were abſurde to imagine that good workes did mooue God to elect vs. Hierome ſaith: The Apoſtle ſaith not he hath elected vs—Cum eſſemus ſancti,
                  Apolog. ad Ruffin. 
                  whē we were holy, ſed vt eſſemus, but that we ſhould be holy. And Auguſtine ſaith. The election of grace doth not onely preuent or go before mens works, but before faith, whence all good works do flow.
               
               Thirdly, Election is not made for the wil of mā, or for that mā would it. For the Apoſtle painely profeſſeth,Rom. 9.16. Polan. lib. de praed.
                   that it is not in him that willeth, but in God, which ſheweth mercie. By will, is meant the cogitation, deſire or endeuour of our minde, which the holy Ghoſt excludeth from Election. Secondly,

the will of man is not eternall, and therefore cannot be the cauſe of eternall election. For the efficient cauſe muſt goe before the effect in time, or at leaſt in nature. But the will of man is not in nature before Gods election, much leſſe then in time. Laſtly, if we were elected for our owne will, many groſſe abſurdities would enſue. Firſt, the grace of God ſhould bee ſubiect to mens wills, as Proſper affirmeth:Polan. ibid. that is, the grace of Election ſhould be inferiour to the will of man, as the effect is to the cauſe: the will of man ſhould bee more excellent then the grace of God. Secondly, it were (as Prosper ſaith) to make the beginning of ſaluation to bee in him that is ſaued. Thirdly, it were in mans power to be either an elect, or a reprobate if he would. Fourthly, all certaintie of Election would be taken away, ſeeing the will of man is inſtable and vncertaine. Fiftly, election would be caſuall, as depending vppon the will of man, which is mutable, and ſo God ſhould be made an Idol of Fortune, that

is, he ſhould chuſe if man would, and not chuſe if man would not. We conclude therefore that the will of man, is not the efficient cauſe of Election.
               Fourthly, God doth not elect any man for his birth or beauty, or for any prerogatiue or excellencie in his perſon▪
                  Rom. 2.11 For God is no accepter of perſons: and theſe things are not before Election, but come after it. Secondly,Deut. 7.7. that which Moſes ſaith of the generall election of all the Iſralites, may bee as truely ſayd of the ſpeciall election of all true Iſralites, that God hath not choſen them for their multitude, but of his own loue, nor for any dignitie in them, but of his owne meere mercie. We ſee God reſpected not the elderſhip of Cain, but chooſe Abell: hee regarded not the riches of N
                        •
                     bal, the wiſedome of Achitophel, the beauty of Abſolom, the comlineſſe of Saul, the princely blood of Iezebel, neither were all the ſeed of Abraham elected,Col. 1.12. as was Abraham. It is God, who makes vs meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saintes, and not any

prerogatiue or dignitie in vs. We call Chriſt our Sauiour, becauſe he by his dignitie and merit hath deſerued our ſaluation of God for vs: euen ſo wee might be called our owne Electors, if we did mooue God to elect vs by our dignities or prerogatiues. Finally God reſpects not theſe things in ſauing vs,
                     
                        〈1 paragraph〉
                     
                   therefore neither in electing vs. For if they did mooue God to elect vs, they ſhould alſo perſwade him to redeeme and ſaue vs, which is againſt the Scripture in many places.
                     Polan. lib. de praedest. pag. 45.
               
               Finally, the merit of Chriſt is not the efficient or impulſiue cauſe of election, though it be of ſaluation. For the efficient cauſe of election, which is without beginning, muſt alſo bee without beginning: but the merit of Chriſt is not frō eternitie: therfore it is not the efficient cauſe of eternall election. Secondly, if Chriſt himſelfe, as Mediator, was elected frō all eternity, then his merit is not the cauſe of electing. but the former is true out of Peter, the latter therefore is alſo true Thirdly, the effect of eternall election

is not the cauſe thereof: but the merit of Chriſt is the effect of election. For God did not elect vs, becauſe Chriſt was to die for vs: but on the contrarie, Chriſt did therefore die for vs, becauſe God had elected vs in him. Therefore the merit of Chriſt is not the efficient cauſe of Gods election.

                     . 21. ſ. 7. Wherefore we do conclude, and with Caluin we doe auerre according to the truth, (Hoc conſilium quoad Electos in gratuita eius miſericordia fundatum eſſe) that the foundation of Gods Election is laied in his free mercie. He will haue mercie,Rom. 9.15. 
                  on whom he will, and chuſeth whom he pleaſeth. And ſo much for the efficient and impulſiue cauſe of election.
               The materiall cauſe, or matter of Election is threefold: firſt in which, that is in Chriſt the Mediatour: ſecondly about which, & that is about certaine men: thirdly of which it doth conſiſt, (of which laſt wee now entreat) and that is the counſell of God. For election is nothing but the counſell of GOD, for the ſeparation of ſome

men to eternall life.
               The formall cauſe is the ordination, aſſumption and ſeparation of certaine men from all others, to the fruition of preſent grace and future glory.
               The ends of Election are three.
               The former concernes God,
                     Bucan loc. 36. Quaeſt. 32. that doth elect: the 2. latter concerne thoſe that are elected. The firſt is the glory of God, and the celebration and declaration of his mercy. Rom. 9.23. That hee might declare the riches of his glorie vpon the veſſels of mercie, which he hath prepared vnto glorie. Eph. 1.6.
                     Sturm de praedeſt. Theſ. 6. 1. Cor. 10.13. 
                  He hath choſen vs to the praiſe of his glorious grace. The glory of God is the ſupreme end of all things, therefore of election. And if we be commanded to make it the ſcope of all our actions, wee need not doubt but that God doth aime at it in all his.
               The ſecond end of Election is,Epheſ. 1.4. 
                  that we ſhould bee holy and blameleſſe before God. Auguſtine ſaith well; He choſe vs not becauſe we were then holy, neither yet becauſe wee would hereafter prooue holy: but he rather choſe vs to this end, that in

the time of grace we might be holy through good works.
               
               The third end, is the ſaluation and glory of the Elect. Therefore they are ſayd to be Ordained to eternall life,
                  Act. 13.48. Rom. 9.23. 2. Theſ. 2.13. 
                  and prepared vnto glorie, and choſen vnto ſaluation. We may not thinke that Election is the abſolute wil of God without any end. It were impietie to attribute ſuch a will to God, as hath no ſcope or end propoſed to it. For if nature doe nothing in vaine, or to no end and purpoſe, much leſſe doth God.
               
                  Ephe. 1. Act. 13. Rom 8. Polan. de praed. pag. 60The effects of Election are the meditation of Chriſt, adoption, vocation, ſauing faith, iuſtification and glorification, which comprehendeth two things: firſt regeneration or ſanctification: in which is conteined perpetuall repentance (that is, auerſion from all euill, and conuerſion vnto God) loue, righteouſneſſe, the hatred of ſinne, the ſtudy of good workes, calling vpon God, true humilitie, a deſire to ſee Chriſt, conſtancie in profeſſing the true faith to the laſt gaſpe.

For Gods Election is the roote of all the gifts of God in vs:
                  
                     Perk. in Gal. c. 4. Polan. de praed. pag. 59 
                  and the foundation of all his ſauing benefits.
               
               Secondly, glorification comprehendeth in it the complement and fruition of all glory in the life to come: that is, of all holines and happineſſe with the Lord foreuer.
               The Subiect of Election is double. The firſt,Ephe. 1.4. is the ſubiect in whom we are elected. This ſubiect is Chriſt: Hee hath choſen vs in him, ſaith Paul. Now we are not elected in Chriſt, as hee is God, or the Word ſimply so conſidered. For in this reſpect he is our Elector, as he ſaith himſelfe,Io
                        •
                     . 13.18. 
                  I know whom I haue choſen. Neither are wee elected in him, as a meere man. For a meere man was not fit for vs to bee elected in. But we are elected in him, as he is God-man, our Head and eternall Mediator, in whom God hath placed all ſpirituall bleſſings, which hee would communicate to vs in his good time.
               And wee are elected in Chriſt,

                  becauſe we were not capable in ourſelues of ſo great excellencie. He only (as Polanus
                  
truely teacheth) is the fit meane, in whom we were elected, conſidering that by election, there is made an vnion and coniunction of vs with God the electour. Caluin alleaging that ſpeech of Paul,
                  Gal. ibid. 
                  (He hath choſen vs in Chriſt) ſaith that it is all one, as if he had ſaid that God, becauſe he found nothing wor
                        •
                     hie of his election in all the ſeed of Adam, did therefore turne his eies vnto his Christ, that hee might elect members as it were out of his bodie, whom hee would take vnto the fellowſhip of life.
                  Perk. de praedeſt. It were therefore very abſurd to dream of any election out of him; hee being the foundation of the execution of Election in reſpect of the beginning, meanes and end.Note; man ſimply conſidered is the obiect of election in reſpect of the preordination of the end: but man corrupted if we regard the ordination of the meanes, that tend vnto the end. Rom. 8.30. 2. Theſ. 2.13. Tit. 1.1. 2. Theſ. 3.2.
               
               The other ſubiect, is the Obiect of Election, or the perſons that are elected. And theſe are not all the ſonnes of Adam, without exception of any. For firſt, hee that taketh all and refuſeth none, cannot properly be ſaid to chuſe. For election ſuppoſeth a reiection. He which makes a choice, refuſeth ſome. Secondly, whom God electeth, hee doth alſo glorifie. But

all are not glorified: therefore all are not elected. Thirdly, ſauing faith is peculiar to the Elect, and not common to all, and is a true effect of Gods election. Now many being deſtitute of true faith for euer, it muſt needs bee that they are alſo out of Gods election. Fourthly, the Scripture ſhewes that ſome are elected, and ſome refuſed, Rom, 11.7. The Elect haue obtained it, but the rest are blinded.

                     , God being the creator of all alike, hath admirablie fore-elected ſome, and forſaken others. Now why God electeth not all (Ne quaeramus ſcrupuloſius, ſi errare nolumus, Aug.) If we would not erre, wee muſt not be too curious in enquiring.

                  Aquinas ſaith truely, God hath no reaſon but his will, why he ſhould elect ſome to glory and caſt away others. Neither doth God offer the leſt iniury, though he doe not chuſe all, becauſe he is not tyed to chuſe any. His Lordſhip is ouer all, his authoritie is abſolute, he may doe with his owne what he will.

Who can hinder him? Wee are all to him as clay in the hand of the Potter. Hee will haue mercie on whom hee will,
                  Rom. 9.18. 
                  and whom hee will hee hardeneth. The rich man of a rout of beggars ſets his loue on one, and paſſeth by the reſt without wronging any. A man entertaines one into his houſe, and paſſeth by many other without any iniury done vnto them; and ſhall we thinke that God may not lawfully chuſe or refuſe whome he pleaſeth? God (ſaith M. Green-ham) is debtour to none, and therefore ſheweth mercie to whom he will. Wee may aſſure our ſelues that his reaſons are moſt iuſt, though vnknowen to vs. For the depth of his counſels cannot be ſounded.

               Seing then all men are not elect men, let vs ſee who are the elect, and what their number is.

bee ſaued, the ſame is vndoubtedly elected. For both theſe propoſitions are infallibly true. 1. Whoſoeuer is elected ſhall be ſaued.

               Secondly, to be ſwift to heare, ſlow to ſpeake, and ſlow to wrath, laying apart all maliciouſneſſe, and the excrements of ſinne, and receiuing with meekeneſſe the word that is grafted into vs, that it may ſaue our ſoules. Iam. 1.21.

Secondly, if we be deſirous and labour to vſe all and euery one of thoſe meanes, which God hath ordained in his word, to bring vs vnto puritie of heart: and if in doing theſe things, we ſimply and ſingly ſeeke to approoue our ſelues vnto God, without either looking for praiſe or profit, rebuke or loſſe from men, and when wee ſeeke not chiefly theſe outward things at Gods hands, Greenham.
               
               The ſecond thing to bee conſidered, is the number of the elect, concerning which, theſe 3, concluſions are worthy to be weighed.
               Firſt, that the elect, conſidered apart ſimply by themſelues, are exceeding many, conſtituting the whole Church of God, which is the myſticall body of Chriſt.Epheſ. 5.23 
                  Many ſhall

come (ſaith Chriſt) from the Eaſt and Weſt and ſhall ſit downe with Abraham,
                  Matth. 8.11 
                  Iſaac,
                  Rom. 5.19 
                  and Iacob in the kingdome of heauen. Paul ſaith that by the obedience of Chriſt Many ſhall be mad righteous.
                  Reu. 7.9 
                  Iohn ſaith he ſaw an Innumerable Multitude of all nations and tongues, which ſtood before the Lambe, clothed with long white robes, and palmes in their handes. Auguſtine ſaith,
                     Lib. 3. de doct. Chriſt. cap. 34 Lib 1. de voc. gent.
                   
                  (Electorum quidam quaſi 
                        ••
                     ndus eſt) that there is as it were a certaine world of the Elect. And Ambroſe ſaith that there is in the Elect 
                        〈◊〉
                      fore-knowne (Specialis quaedam vniuerſitas) à ſpeciall kinde of vniuerſalitie, (vt de toto mundo totus mundus) That the whole World out of the whole world, and all men from all men ſeeme to be taken vnto life. So then we ſay that the number of Gods elect conſidered by themſelues alone is great.
               Secondly,Matth. 7.11 the Elect in compariſon of the Reprobate and damned are but few. For ſtraite is the way of life,Math. 20.
                        •
                     6. and few there be that finde it. And many (ſaith Chriſt) are called, but fewe are choſen. Chriſts Flocke is but a little

flocke.
                  Luke 12.32 Rom. 9.27 Iſ. 10.27 Heb. 11.12 And Paul out of Eſay ſaith, that though the number of the children of Iſrael were at the ſand of the ſea (as indeed they were) yet ſhall but a remnant be ſaued. Which point muſt bee well conſidered, becauſe ſome haue imagined that God hath elected all. But if this were true, then either all ſhould be ſaued, or elſe God is changeable, and doth alter his purpoſe of himſelfe: or els is ouercome and drawne to change it by ſome other, which things cannot but offend a iudicious and godly eare.
               Thirdly, the number of the Elect is certaine and defined. God knowes them all, and they can neither bee diminiſhed nor increaſed.
                     Inſtit. lib. 2 It is truely ſaid of Trelcatius, Electorum & reproborum numerus & numeratus certus est, qua
                        •
                     uis vterque nobis non certo compertus. The number of the Elect is certaine, both how manie they are, and who they are, although it bee not certainely knowen to vs. God knowes them and their number, though man doe not. This was alſo the iudgement of

                  Auguſtine, who ſpeaketh thus;
                     Decor. 
                     
                        •
                      
                     gra c. 13▪
                   
                  Theſe things I ſpeake of them, who are predeſtinated vnto the kingdom of God (Quorum it a certus eſt numerus, vt nec addatur eis quiſquam, nec minuatur ex eis) Whoſe number is ſo certaine, that neither any can be added to them, nor taken from them.
               
               Hauing now ſpoken of the perſons that are elected, it will not bee amiſſe briefly to ſet downe their prerogatiues, which no reprobate can partake of.
               Firſt, God knowes them,2. Tim. 2.19. and approues and loues them. Now if the grace of earthly Princes be in ſo great requeſt, what price can be ſet of his loue, who is the Prince of all Princes, and the grand Commander of all the world?
               Secondly, a liuely and true ſauing faith pertaines to them onely:Tit. 1.1. Acts. 13▪48 Inſtit. l. 3. 
                        •
                     . 22. ſ. 10. and therefore Paul calles it the faith of the elect; & the ſcripture ſaith, that ſo many as were, ordained to eternal life beleeued. Caluin ſaith that faith is a ſingular pledge of Gods fatherly loue, layed vp in store for thoſe his ſonnes, whom he hath adopted. And this gift is very excellent.

For by Faith we liue, by Faith wee walke, by Faith wee are iuſtified and our heartes purified, by it wee vanquiſh the world, and without it, it is vnpoſſible to pleaſe God.
               Thirdly, effectuall vocation and conuerſion vnto God belongs not to the Reprobate,Rom. 8.30 but to them, Whom 
                        〈◊〉
                      hath fore-knowen and predeſtinated, them he calleth.
               
               Fourthly, the redemption from ſinne and miſerie, and the righteousneſſe which is by Chriſt is theirs, and theirs alone, Iſ. 53.6, 12. 1. Cor. 1 30 Gregorie ſaith well;Homil. in Ezeck. 
                  Pro electorum vit
                        •
                      vſque admortem ſe tradidit author vitae: The Lord of life laied downe his life, that they might liue,
                  
                     In 2. Reg. cap. 7 
                  which were elected vnto life. And Angelome, ſaith; Quae eſt gens in terra alia what other people is there in the earth (praeter populum electum) beſides the elect: for which God, the ſonne of God, vouchſafed to come into this world as into Egypt, that taking vppon him the ſhape of a ſeruant, he might redeeme vnto himſelfe with his blood an acceptable people ſtudious of good workes.
               
               
                  Fiftly,Col. 3.12 they onely are adorned with the ſpeciall graces of the ſpirit: they onely are ſanctified and renewed.
                     Sent. l. 2. c. 5 De verb. Apoſt ſer. 1 
                  Iſidore ſaith; Spirituall grace is not diſtributed vnto all (ſed tantummodo electis donatur) but is giuen to the elect onely. Nature (ſaith Auguſtine) is common to all men, but not grace.
               
               Sixtly, ſaluation belongs to none but to them. Rom. 11.7. What then? Iſrael hath not attained that he ſought: but the Election (that is the Elect) hath obtained it, and the reſt haue been hardened. Faith in Chriſt is theirs onely:Ioh. 3.16 Mark. 16.16 and he that beleeueth in him ſhall be ſaued, but he that will not ſhall be damned. As the Elect are the onely true members of the Church militant: ſo they ſhall be the onely members of the Church triumphant.Pſal. 33.12 Therefore wee may boldly ſay with the Pſalmiſt; Bleſſed is that Nation, whoſe God is Iehouah, euen the people, that he hath choſen for his inheritance.
                  Pſal. 65.
                        •
                     
                   
                  Bleſſed is the man whom thou chuſeſt and cauſeſt to come vnto thee.
               
               Seuenthly, none of the Elect ſhall be whollie ſeduced, nor vtterly decline

and periſh. For Chriſt takes it for granted that the Elect cannot be ſeduced,
                  Matth. 24.24. Iohn 10.28 Ier. 32.40. and ſaith concerning his ſheepe; I giue vnto them eternall life, and they ſhall neuer periſh, neither ſhall any plucke them out of mine hand. And the Lord hath promiſed to ſtand by them, and to put his feare into their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from him.Pſal. 94.14. 
                  Surely (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) the Lord will not faile his people, nor forſake his inheritance.
                  
                     In 7. cap. Ioh.
                   
                  Gregorie ſaith that temtation doth hide the light of righteouſneſſe in the heart of the elect oftentimes (ſed non interimit) but puts it not out, and makes it pale & quiuer (ſed funditus nō extinguis) but doth not extinguiſh it altogether. Saint Auguſtine ſaith well; Peters faith failed not in his heart, when open confeſſion with the mouth failed him.
               
               Eightly, God doth cauſe his Angels to protect and guard them:Pſal. 34.7. 
                  The Angel of the Lord pitcheth round about them that feare him, and deliuereth them. And as Paul ſpeaketh,Heb. 1.14▪
                   
                  they are miniſtring ſpirits, ſent foorth to miniſter all for their ſakes, which ſhalbe heirs of ſaluation.

Auguſtine ſaith,
                     Lib. 1. 
                        •
                      
                     
                        •
                     .12. 
                  This alſo I eſteeme a very great benefit, in that the Lord hath giuen me an angel of peace to keepe me from my birth to my death.
                  Matth. 24.
                        •
                     1.
               
               Ninthly, God ſhall ſend his Angels with a great ſound of a trumpet, and they ſhall gather together his Elect from the foure windes, and from the one end of the heauens vnto the other.
                  Matth. 25.33, 34, 41. Chriſt alſo when he comes to iudgement, will ſet them on his right hand, and ſay; Come yee bleſſed of my father, take the inheritance of the kingdome prepared for you from the foundation of the world. But hee will place the Reprobate on his left hand, and pronounce vnto them the dolefull ſentence of condemnation, ſaying; Depart from me ye curſed into euerlasting fire, which is prepared for the Deuill and his Angels.
               
               Tenthly, the Elect shall iudge the Reprobate.1. Cor. 6.2, 3. 
                  Know ye not (ſaith Paul) that the Saintes ſhall iudge the world? Know ye not that wee ſhall iudge the Angels? Their faith and pietie ſhall condemne the wicked, and bereaue them of excuſe: and as the Iuſtices ſit about the

                        •
                     ſes, ſo ſhall the Elect attend vppon CHRIST at the laſt iudgement, and ſhall ſubſcribe vnto his ſentence, and applaud his proceedings.
               Moreouer, all men, but eſpecially all miniſters ought to indure all things for their ſakes.
                     
                        •
                     . Tim. 2.10 
                  I ſuffer all things (ſaith Paul) for the Elects ſake, that they might alſo obtaine the ſaluatiō, which is in Chriſt Ieſus with eternall glorie.
               
               
                  Luke, 18 7, 8Againe, God will auenge his Elect, though he ſeeme ſlow in reuenging thoſe wrongs,Zach. 2, 8 that are done vnto them: For they that touch them, doe touch the apple of his eie.
               
               Furthermore, God for the loue he beareth to his Elect, hee will ſhorten the dayes of crueltie and calamitie.Mar. 13 20 
                  For the Elects ſake (ſaith Chriſt) which hee hath choſen, hee hath ſhortned thoſe daies of tribulation.
               Moreouer, the Elect fight with the Lambe, againſt Antichriſt and his kingdome, which ſhall by the Lambe be ouercome.Reu. 17.14. 
                  For he is Lord of Lords, and King of Kings: and they that are on

his ſide, are called, and choſen, and faithfull.
               
               Beſides, the Elect need not dread death and damnation.Rom. 8 33 For as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, Who ſhall laie any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? It is God that iustifieth who ſhal condemne? Finally,1. Ioh. 5.13 
                        •
                     . Pet. 1.10 Pſal. 15 the Elect may bee aſſured in this life of their eternall election vnto life: Therfore Peter exhorts vs to make our Election ſure: and the holy Ghoſt ſets downe the notes of thoſe, that are the true members of the Church, and ſhal reſt vpon Gods mountaine. Now this certaintie may bee had two wayes. Firſt, by the inward teſtimonie of Gods ſpirit, which giues teſtimonie to our ſpirit,Rom. 8.16 that wee are the ſonnes of God. Secondly,Gal. 5.22 be the effects of election (as are the fruits of the ſpirit mentioned by Paul) which God appropriateth vnto his Elect, and which are as a ladder, by which we may aſſend as it were vp into heauen,
                     Keck. Syſt. The. l 3.42. & eaſily diſcerne if we bee elected. Becauſe (as one well ſaith) Election includeth the means▪ therefore we muſt determine of it by the meanes. The

Apoſtle ſaith, that whom God foreknew, he did alſo predeſtinate to bee like to the image of his ſonne, and doth call, iuſtifie,
                  Rom. 8.30 
                  and glorifie them. Therefore by conuerſion we may hence inferre that thoſe are elected, whom he doth conforme vnto his ſonne, and effectually call, iuſtifie and regenerate; theſe being neceſſarie meanes, by which God doth accompliſh his eternall election.
               Now this prerogatiue is the greater, and more to bee reſpected, for theſe reaſons.
               Firſt,
                     M. Rogers pag. 496. becauſe the Elect may haue better aſſurance of his election to ſaluation, then anie man can haue of the things hee holdeth in this life by ſeale, writing, witnes, or any other way, that Law can deuiſe or preſcribe.
               
               Secondly, the longer wee liue, the better we may be aſſured: the longer this aſſurance is inioyed, the ſtronger we may finde it.
               Thirdly, this certentie doth beger exceeding ioy. For what can raiſe the like ioy in our hearts, as this, that wee know that we ſhall ſee the good pleaſures

of the Lord in the land of the liuing, and ſhall haue an houſe not made with handes, but eternall in the heauens? And what greater ioy can any man deſire to enioy, then to be aſſured that he is elected to eternal ioy?
               Fourthly, this aſſurance is the more excellent, conſidering the woe of the Reprobates which want it, and the weariſome ſights and inexplicable terrors of ſuch as are ſwallowed vp of diſpaire.
               Fiftly, this priuiledge is the more to be accounted of, becauſe we may enioy it dayly through our life, and for that the longer we be partakers of it, the ſweeter it is vnto vs.
               Laſtly, this aſſurance is an infallible argument of true faith, by which wee come to Christ, we approch to the Father,
                  
                     
                        
                           •
                        hryſ ſer. le fide.Rom. 4.20 Heb. 11.1 
                  and haſten to heauen. For faith is an enemie to doubting and incredulitie, and is an vndoubted certenty or perſwaſion.
               Thus much concerning the ſubiects of Election. It remaineth yet to ſpeak of the properties and ſignes thereof,

and thence wee paſſe to the accompliſhent of it.
               The properties of it, are eſpecially three.
               Firſt it is moſt free, without all obligation, conpulſion, externall inſtigation, or preuiſion of future preparations, merits, faith. For hath not the Potter libertie ouer his clay, to make of the ſame lumpe,Rom. 9.21 one a veſſell vnto honour, and another a veſſell to diſhonour? Who can compell the Almightie? Or what is before his will? Why did he make no more worldes then one? Why did he make choiſe of the Iſraelites aboue all nations? Why made he no more kindes of creatures, or ſet no more Sunnes to ſhine in the heauens? Who art thou, that thou dareſt diſpute with God? The will of God (ſaith Auſten) is the cauſe of all things that are.
                  
                     Degen. cont. Man.l. 
                           •
                        .c. 2.Hugo de S. Vict. Iſ. 46. And Hugo ſaith that of Gods will, which is the cauſe of all things, there is no cauſe. Deus eſt liberrimum agens. God is a moſt free Agent, and doth whatſoeuer he will. Therefore Aquinas ſaith well▪
                  
                     Sum. 1. par qu. 23. art. 5 that the difference betwixt

the ſaued and the damned, proceedes from the principall intentions of the firſt Agent.
               
               Secondly, the decree of Election is from all eternitie, not onely before we did beleeue, but before wee were.Rom. 9.11 Gods Election and reprobation was paſt vpon Iacob and Eſa
                        •
                     
                   before they were borne, and ere they had done good or euill. And the Apoſtle teacheth, that God did chuſe vs before the foundation of the world.Epheſ. 1.4 In Tit 1 
                  Sedulius
                  ▪ ſaith that God purpoſed with himſelfe (ante omnia mundi tempora) before the beginning of the world to ſaue thoſe that beleeue. In like manner also S. Auſten ſaith; He fore-knew vs before he made vs,
                  
                     Lib 5 de craedeſt.
                   
                  and elected vs in his fore-knowledge (Cum n
                        •
                     ndum feciſſet) when yet he had not made vs. And againe; intra mundum facti ſumus, & ante mundum electi ſumus: wee were made after the world, but wee were elected before the world.
                  D. Willet. in Ioh 17. lect. 16. For (as one ſaith well) like as Dauid was annointed and appointed to be king, long before he entred to his kingdome: and as Moſes was deſigned to be the deliuerer of Iſrael, forty yeeres before he exerciſed his office: ſo the

Elect of God, were long agoe ordained to ſaluation, though the accompliſhment thereof they must expect with patience.
               
               Thirdly, the election of God is conſtant, perpetuall, immutable, and inuiolable. For the principles and firſt grounds of things, are ſtable and vnmoueable: and that which is contingent, mutable, and vncertaine is therefore barred from being an originall or ground. Now the decree of election is the foundation and ſcaturidge of ſaluation; therefore it is certaine, ſtedfaſt and vnchangeable. Secondly, God the author of Election is an immutable, vnreſiſtable and conſtant Agent, or Architecht, and doth ſeriouſly and effectually ſeparate and elect ſome men vnto himſelfe, & therfore his decree cannot but bee fulfilled.Iam. 1.17 Mal. 3.6 Thirdly the Scripture is euident in auouching this truth. My counſell (ſaith the Lord) ſhall stand.
                  Iſ. 46.10. 2. Tim. 2.19. Vrſin de Chr. rel. par. 2 
                  The foundation of God (ſaith Paul) remaineth ſure. The decree of Election is called a foundation for two cauſes. Firſt, becauſe it is the beginning and wellſpring

of our ſaluation, and of all the meanes tending to ſaluation.
                     Kek. l. 3 Syft 7 Theol.
                   Secondly it is ſo termed, for the ſureneſſe and firmneſſe of it, becauſe the ſame is neuer ſhaken, but remaines immutable. For euery foundation hath this neceſſarie condition, that it bee ſtrong and ſteddy, ſo as that the reſt of the building may ſtay vpon it ſurely, and not be remoued. And ſuch a firme foundation is Gods election. For whoſoeuer are elected, ſhall ſtill remaine elected, and ſhall neuer bee reiected.Ioh. 6.36 
                  This is my fathers will (ſaith Chriſt) that of all which he hath giuen me I ſhould looſe nothing. Thoſe whom he loued euer, hee loueth for euer.Ioh. 13.1 De fide c. 35 
                  Firmiſsime tene:
Hold (ſaith S. Auguſtine) most aſſuredly, and nothing doubt at all (Neque perire poſſe aliquem) that neither any of thoſe can periſh, whom God hath predestinated vnto the kingdome of heauen, nor that any of thoſe can by any meanes come, whom he hath not predeſtinated vnto life. Now if none of the Elect can periſh, then Gods election remaineth conſtant.
               So much for the properties: the

                  Signes of Election are many.
               Firſt, the loue of God is the ground of election.D. Willet on Ioh 17.

                  and gaue him richer giftes, and more coſtly ſuites of apparell, then to the rest of his brethren: ſo the Lord beſtoweth the beſt gifts vpon his owne children. Now the graces of regeration, the spirituall gifts of faith, hope, and loue, are without all compariſon the moſt principall. Therefore he that hath faith, hope and loue, may aſſure himſelfe of Gods loue, and that hee is (in electorum albo) in the ranke and roll of Gods elect; theſe being infallible tokens, and vndoubted effects of Election, and fore-runners of eternall life.
               Secondly,
                     M. Perk. on Gal. 4. v 9 
                  there is (as one hath excellently deliuered) a knowledge in God, whereby he knowes who are his: and this knowledge brings foorth an other knowledge in vs, whereby wee know God for our God. There is an election in God, which works in the Elect another election, wherby

they chuſe God for their God. The loue whereby God loueth vs, workes in vs another loue, wherby we loue God. Chriſt firſt apprehends vs, & this apprehenſion of his, works in vs the apprehēſion of faith, wherby we lay hold vpon him. Hoec ille. If theſe things therefore be in vs, we may conclude infallibly that we are the elect of God. For they are the fruits of his loue & the works of his ſpirit, & therfore irrefragable teſtimonies and tokens of Election. The ſun by his light ſhines vpon vs, and by the ſame light we view and behold the ſunne. To conclude; theſe alſo are ſure ſignes of Election, which I will ſet downe as I finde them in the workes of that zealous Preacher.

and a deſire to thinke and ſpeake of heauenly things. 5 A conflict of the fleſh and ſpirit, & therein by practiſe, the power of the ſpirit getting the vpper hand. 6. A purpoſe vnfeined (vpon ſtrength receiued) of vowing ones ſelfe wholly to the glory of God, and good of our brethren. 7 A reſignation of our ſelues into Gods handes.
               8 An expecting of the dayly increaſe of our ſoules health, and our bodyes reſurrection. 9. An acknowledgement
of our offences, with a true purpoſe to leaue them. 10 The forgiuing of our enemies, and a delight in Gods ſaints. 11. A deſire that after death the Church of God may floriſh and haue all peace. 12. A ſpirit without guile: that is, an vnfeined purpoſe alwayes to doe well, howſoeuer our infirmities put vs by it.
               Now though a man ſhall not find all theſe things alwayes in him, there is yet matter of true comfort, if hee finde any: It is ſufficient to prooue it true fire, and not painted if there bee ſmoke or heate onely, though no

flame: If there be but breath, it is ynough to ſhew life, though the body ſtirre not, and one Apple is ſufficient to prooue the tree to liue: ſo one good and conſtant motion or reſolution of grace, is ſufficient to prooue a mans election vnto glory. By this wee may know that wee belong to God,

                  if we finde any impreſsion of the grace of God in vs. But if all theſe ſignes be wanting, yet wee may not diſpaire, but commend our ſelues to the grace of God, and vſe the meanes of ſaluation. For a man may be elected, though for a time he liue vnconuerted, and in his ſinnes, as wee ſee by the examples of Paul, and of the thiefe vpon the Croſſe. Though this be true, that Whoſoeuer is conuerted is elected: yet this is not true, that Whoſoeuer is not conuerted, the ſame is not Elected. Becauſe the Elect may be for a time aliants from God & vnregenerated, as were the Epheſians, Corinthians,

               The trueth of this aſſertion is euident, by theſe 4. reaſons following
               Firſt, none of the yeeres of vnderſtanding were euer ſaued without the regeneration of the Spirit, without faith in Chriſt, without repentance towards God, without loue to the Saintes, and finall perſeuerance; for theſe things are euery where vrged in the Scriptures: therefore the Elect were predeſtinated vnto theſe means, by which they might come vnto eternall life, which is their end.
               Secondly,Rom. 2.9. God threatens eternall deſtruction to the wicked and vnbeleeuers, but promiſeth eternall happineſſe to all penetent, faithfull,Ezek▪ 18.21 righteous and godly men, which perſeue in pietie vnto the end: therefore b

                   theſe meanes of Predeſtination the Elect doe clime vp to heauen and attaine to life.
               
                  Thirdly, the Apoſtle doth expreſly place effectuall vocation and iuſtification,Rom. 8.30 betwixt predeſtination and glorification as the fore-runners and antecedents of it.
               Fourthly, the very word Predestination, doth teach as much. For predeſtination is not onely the preparation,

                         lib 3. conſtitution, and ordination of the end, but of the meanes alſo, which tend vnto the end. Predeſtination (ſaith Augustine) is the preparation of the benefit of God, by which thoſe are most certainely deliuered, who are deliuered. And Aquinas ſaith, that three things are of be conſidered in predeſtination; the Deſtination of the counſell, the execution of the ſame, and the meanes (cauſas medias) of the execution. Theſe two principles are therefore to be remembred.
               Firſt, that Whoſoeuer are elected to eternall life as to the end, the ſame are alſo elected and ordained to the meanes of that end.
               
               Secondly, that the Firſt cauſe doth not aboliſh or take away the ſecond.
               
               Thus wee haue ſhewed, that God

doth execute his decree of Election by meanes, and that the meanes and the end are inſeparably conioyned.
               Theſe Meanes are of two ſorts. Some are ſuch as ſerue for the execution of the decree, both of Election and Reprobation indifferently. Others ſerue onely for the Execution of Election, by which the Elect are diſtinguiſhed from the Reprobate.
               Thoſe common meanes are two; the creation of man, and the permiſsion of his fall, or his fall permitted.Gen. 1.27 Eccle 7.31
               
               The Creation of man is the forming of man, according to the image of God, but yet in a changeable condition. Here we muſt remember theſe 2. things. Firſt, that God created the ſubſtance of ſoule and body, and that he gaue them certaine faculties & powers, and that withall there was placed in them true righteouſnes, knowledge & holines without any prauitie, 
                     Cyr. l. 8. Theſ.

                     . 1. diſtē
                  per, or iniquitie. But yet (as Cyrill truly ſpeaketh) Our father Adam was of a mutable diſpoſition, and had by nature habilitie to loue iuſtice and hate iniquitie,

and contrariwiſe to embrace iniquitie and to refuſe iuſtice. For God properly and by himſelfe is conſtant and immutable: and if any thing elſe continue conſtant it is through him, who is bound to none,
                     Iſa. 46.10. but will doe whatſoeuer hee will. A Gold-ſmith makes a coſtly Iewell, beſet with pearles and precious ſtones, and voyd of all deformitie, but yet ſo makes it, that if it fall, it may be crackt and broken: ſo God made man moſt perfect, and garniſhed his nature with excellent graces, and gaue him power to continue in the ſame perfection if hee would: yet did he not make him ſo vnchangeable but that hee might both fall, and by falling breake and looſe his excellencie, as the euent declareth.
               Secondly, we muſt know that Adam was no priuate perſon, but repreſented all mankinde. And therefore we ſtood and fell with him. For hee was the root and we are his branches: he was the ſpring, and we the ſtreams: he was as the head, and wee are as the members. As the King, his Nobles,

Knights and Burgeſſes doe repreſent the whole realme in the Parliament: euen ſo did Adam repreſent the perſon of his whole poſteritie. Whatſoeuer he receiued of God, he receiued it for himſelfe and for all his progeny: and what he loſt, he likewiſe loſt for himſelfe and for them all; as wee ſee a man by high treaſon doth taint his blood, and diſgrace his poſteritie.
                     In Triph.
                   
                  Iustine ſaith: By ſinning Adam made his poſteritie obnoxious vnto death, & made them (vniuerſo) All guiltie of his firſt offence.
                  
                     In Pſal. Poenit.
                   The Lord (ſaith Gregorie) did ſo make Adam, as that he might procreate children without ſinne, if hee continued in the obedience of his Creator: but becauſe the ſoule of man refuſed to obey her Lord, the procreation of children is in ſinne.
               
               Wee ſee now that Creation is a meane of the execution of Gods election. For a man muſt firſt be, before he can be ſaued. Yet it is no ſpeciall, or peculiar meanes. For all that are created ſhall not be ſaued, ſome ſhall be damned. All men (ſaith Proſper) are of God created:
                  Proſp. Reſp. ad cap. Gal 
                  but of this vniuerſalitie
                  
(or companie) ſome are to bee damned with the Diuell: others ſhall raigne with Chriſt.
               
               The Permiſsion of the fall is that, whereby God ſuffred Adam and his ſonnes to reuolt, & fall into ſinne, and did not hinder the fall, which he could haue done, if it had ſo pleaſed him, But hee would not hinder it, becauſe ſuch was his pleaſure for certaine cauſes beſt knowne vnto himſelfe. In the meane, let no man thinke that God was iniurious. For 1. he was not indebted to vs to confirme vs by his grace▪ & to keepe vs from declining. 2. this fall was by God permitted, for the greater benefit of all his Elect. For their glory procured by Chriſt (which had neuer been, if man had neuer fallen) doth farre ſurpaſſe the glorie, which was giuen them in their creation.
                     Expoſ. in 1. Reg. cap. 4. 
                  Great are the euils (ſaith Gregorie) which wee ſuffer by reaſon of that firſt offence: but what faithfull man would not indure greater, rather then want ſo great a Redeemer?
               Thirdly, though God (not bound

to let) did permit this fall, yet it is not to be aſcribed vnto him, as to the cauſe thereof. For hee did not incline his heart to ſinne: hee did not infuſe the leaſt corruption into his ſoule: neither did hee with-draw any grace before inſpired into him: but hee fell by his free-will, through his owne default, at the perſwaſion and ſuggeſtion of the Diuell. Tertullian ſaith truely;
                     Lib. 2. aduerſ Marc.
                   
                  As God brought man into the ſtate of life:

Ghost is no worker of this wickedneſſe. And though we ſhould ſay, that God willed that reuolt; yet we muſt know that God did not will it (poſitiue) ſo as to produce, effect, or giue being to it: but (negatiuè & deſere
                        •
                     do) becauſe his will was to leaue Adam to himſelfe, and not to preſerue him from reuolting, that he might bee prooued by temptation, and that it might appeare what the creature is able to doe, when the Creator ſhall with-draw the ſtaffe of his grace,

                   and ceaſe to ſupport. Therefore we conclude with Clemens, That the fault of mans chuſing of that which was forbidden, is not to be transferred (or aſcribed) vnto God.
               
               Thus we ſee the ſecond meanes of the Execution of Election, Which is a very neceſſary meane. For if a man had not fallen, then had there been no place for vocation, iuſtification by Chriſt, and ſanctification by the Spirit. But though this meane is neceſſarie, yet it is not appropriated to Election▪ becauſe then all that fell, ſhould be reſtored. But as Ambroſe

               For the firſt:
                     Perk on Gal c. 5. ver. 13. 
                  Effectuall vocation (or calling) is an action of God tranſlating men from the kingdom of darkeneſſe to his

owne Kingdome. And it is two-folde
                     •
                   Extraordinary, and Ordinary. Extraordinary vocation, is an immediate and ſpeciall worke of the Spirit, whereby without outward meanes hee ſmiteth the heart, and inwardly ſpeaketh to the ſoule, and by the infuſion of grace doth make the heart to anſwere his call, and drawe neere vnto him. This calling without the miniſterie of the word, is very rare and vnuſuall. But the Lord, that is aboue meanes, is not tyed to meanes, but can worke without meanes, when it pleaſeth his Maieſtie ſo to doe.
               Effectuall vocation,
                     Rolloc. de voc. c. 1. which is ordinary, is that, Whereby God calleth out of darkeneſſe into his marueilous light, from the power of Sathan vnto God, thoſe whom he knew from eternitie, and predestinated vnto life, of his meere fauour, by the promulgation of the couenant of grace, or preaching of the Goſpell. Or;
               
                  It is,
                  
                     Perk on Iude. v. 1. 
                  when grace is not onely offered, but giuen alſo by God through the effectuall working of his Spirit in our heartes: which is the beginning of grace in vs, hee

himſelfe laying the first foundation of it, by giuing power to receiue the word, to mingle it with faith, and to bring foorth the fruites of new obedience,
               
               This ordinary effectuall calling hath two parts; Inuitement and Admiſſion.
               
               
                  Inuitement,

                   is when God offers remiſſion of ſinnes, and life euerlaſting to them that beleeue: Outwardly, by the preaching of the Goſpell: Inwardly, by the inſpiration of heauenly deſires.
               
                  Admiſsion is, when men are entred into the kingdome of grace: and it is either outward, or inward. Outward admiſſion is made in Baptiſme. Inward admiſſion is, when men are taken out of old Adam, and by faith ingraffed in to Chriſt;. For by this inſition into Chriſt, men are made reall members of Gods kingdome: Haec ille.
               
               For the better conceiuing and vnderſtanding of this Calling, theſe points enſuing are worthy our conſideration.
               
                  The efficient cauſe of effectuall Calling is Almightie God.1. Cor. 1.9. 
                  By him we are called vnto the fellowſhip of his Sonne. He hath called vs vvith an holy calling.2. Tim 1.9 1. Pet. 2.9. Yee are (ſaith Peter) a choſen generation, that ye ſhould ſhew foorth his vertues that hath called you.
                  1. Pet. 1.15 And againe, As hee which hath called you, is holy, that is, God: so Iude 1.
               But here we muſt beware that wee doe not ſeparate the perſons. For it is a worke common to the Trinitie. One ſaith well:
                     M. Perk. on Gal. 5.13. 
                  God the Father (doth call vs) in Chriſt by the Spirit: for he is abſolute Lord of all his Creatures, and therefore he may call out of the kingdome of darkeneſſe into his owne kingdome whom he will.
               
               His inſtruments are the Miniſters of the word, and therefore are called Conorkers, Fathers, Sauiours. His ordinary outward meanes, is the preaching of the Goſpell. Hee hath called you by our Gospell,
                  2. Theſ. 2.14. ſaith Paul. The Law ſerues to prepare the heart for grace: but it is the oyly drops of the Goſpell, that by the power of the

Spirit doe ſoften the heart and make it ſupple and pliable: it like Balme doeth reuiue and comfort the heart.Rom. 1.16 
                  The Goſpell is the power of God (that is the inſtrument of Gods power) to ſaluation to all that beleeue. Afflictions alſo, loſſes, croſ
                     •
                  es, ſickneſſe, good examples, and the like, are by Gods bleſſing good preparatiues of grace: but the preaching of the Goſpell is the proper inſtrument of the Spirit, for the effecting of grace. By it, God ſpeakes to the eare of the ſoule, and by it as by a Pipe, hee conueyes his graces into the cisterne of our hearts.
               Now GOD, when hee calles a man,
                     Rolloc. de voc. c. 1. performes a double worke of grace.
               Firſt, he doth illuminate vs by his holy Spirit, infuſing a new and heauenly light into our minde, being ſo blind before, as that it, neither ſaw,

                     . Cor. 2. l 24 nor could ſee the things which doe belong to the ſpirit of God. The naturall man (ſaith Paul) perceiueth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſſe vnto him, neither can he know

them. In like manner alſo in the will, which is altogether peruerſe, and wholly fallen from God, he worketh an vprightneſſe, and in all the affections a new holineſſe. Hence proceeds that new man, which is created after God in righteouſneſſe,
                  Ephe. 4.24 
                  and true holineſſe.
               
               Secondly, he cauſeth vs being enlightned and thus changed, to apprehend his mercy, to deſire and affect our amendement, and to anſwere vnto his call,Pſal 27.8 like Dauid: VVhen thou ſaidſt Seeke yee my face, mixe heart anſwered vnto thee, O Lord, I will ſeeke thy face.
                  Pſal. 40.6.7 When God had pierced Dauids eare with the augur of his Spirit, he anſwered, Lo, I come.
               
               The primary cauſe, or the foundation of this vocation is the free grace of God.
                  Gal. 1.15. 
                        
                           •
                        relc. Inſtit. l. 2. For this Vocation is of gift, and not of merit: of Grace, and not of Nature, God calling whom he will, and againe, whom he will, either not calling, or not calling them effectually. The Apoſtle ſaith, that hee hath called vs with an holy calling, not according to our works, b
                        •
                     t according to his own purpoſe & grace.
                  2. Tim. 1.9.
               
               
                  The meritorious cause of this effectuall Calling, is the merits of Chriſt. For Chriſt hath merited in our behalfe that the Holy Ghoſt ſhould bee ſent into vs, to illuminate and adorne our hearts with his graces.
               The matter whereof this Vocation doth conſiſt, is a ſpeciall, powerfull and inward worke of the Spirit.
               The forme, and (as it were) the life and ſoule thereof, is the illumination and information of the mind, and an efficatious bending, conforming and working of the heart & wil, whereby it becomes obedient to the voice of God, and returnes (as it were) an audible and liuely Eccho into his eare.
               The end is double: firſt, the glory of God, and the commendation of his mercie, to whom we muſt aſcribe both grace and nature, and of whom we haue receiued our ſoules and bodies, yea, and the very ſoule of our ſoules, which is his Spirit. The ſecond end of this vocation is our deliuerance and tranſlation out of ignorance, infidelitie, ſenſualitie and rebellion, vnto

ſpirituall grace and glory. For we are called out of darkneſſe into light,2. Theſ. 2.14 that we might walke in light, and no longer ſerue the Prince of darkneſſe. We are called out of the world, vnto God: to the end that wee ſhould relinquiſh the luſts of the world and ſerue God, that walking vprightly before him in this world, wee may reigne (like Princes) with him in the world to come.
               The effects and fruites of this Calling are; a reformed iudgement, a fleſhy heart, a yeelding vnto the Lord, a ſ
                     •
                  ight from the works of darkneſſe, an attentiue and hungry eare, a ſpirituall reliſhing and receiuing of the ſolacious and ſweete promiſes of the Goſpel. When a skilfull Muſitian hath once ſtrung, tuned, and ſtrucke his inſtrument, it ſends out many pleaſant and ſweet ſoundes: ſo when the Lord hath once breathed his Spirit of life in at the noſtrils of our ſoules: when he hath once tuned the ſtrings of our ſinfull hearts, and hath toucht them with the finger of his ſpirit, he

makes them ſend forth many delectable and harmonious ſounds, wherein he takes delight. When Chriſt had cried to Lazarus, being dead, and ſaid,Ioh. 11.43, 44 
                  Lazarus Come foorth! He forthwith reuiued, and came foorth of the graue.Acts 9.40 So when Peter had ſaid to dead Tabitha; Tabitha ariſe! She opened her eies immediatly, and ſate vp. Euen ſo, when he ſhall vouchſafe to call a man with his powerfull voice, and ſhal effectually ſpeake vnto the heart and ſay, Ariſe thou that ſleepeſt in thy ſinne, come foorth of the graue of iniquitie, ſtand vp, and walke in the wayes of righteouſnes. his call is ſo mightie, and his word ſo powerfull and vnuanquiſhable, that the man to whom hee doth ſo ſpeake, muſt needs awake, ariſe, come foorth and walke. The voice of the Lord (ſaith Dauid) is mightie:Pſal.29 
                  the voice of the Lord breaketh the Cedars: it deuideth the flames of fire: it maketh the Wilderneſſe to tremble, and diſcouereth the Forreſts.Theſe are the effects of that voice.Thunder. In like maner, the voice which God ſpeaketh to the eare of the ſoule in his

effectuall Vocation, is ſo mightie and ſo glorious, as that it rendeth the heart and makes it tremble, it diſcouereth the ſoule and diuides in twaine, and peirceth into the moſt ſecret places of it.Ioſh. 6.20. And looke as at the ſound of the ſeauen Trumpets the wall of Iericho fell flat downe: and as at that efficatious voyce of Chriſt,Iob. 18.6. ſaying I am he, his enemies that came to apprehend him, went away back-ward and fell to the ground: euen ſo when Gods voice ſhall ſound in a mans eare, and when Chriſt ſhall ſpeake effectually vnto the heart, the walles of hell ſhall reele and totter, the fortreſſes of iniquitie ſhall be ruinated, the caſtles of ſinne ſhall be caſt downe, our ſpirituall enemies ſhall bee driuen backeward, the ſtrong man Satan ſhall bee fettered, and his curſed workes diſſolued. Theſe are the admirable effects of this glorious voyce: theſe are the worthy workes of Gods effectuall Calling. We may therefore iuſtly ſay; The voyce of the Lord is mightie, The voyce of the Lord is glorious and

bringeth wonderfull things to paſſe.
               
               The ſubiects of this effectuall vocation, or the perſons, that are effectually called, are not all of all ſortes and fexes without exception of any,Rom. 8.30 but the Elect of God. And therefore Paul ſaith that God hath called thoſe, whome he did fore-know and predestinate.

Now all men doe not perſeuere, therefore all are not effectually called: all are not glorified, therefore all are not pertakers of this kinde of calling. Finally, God vouchſafes not an outward calling vnto all: all men haue not heard of the Goſpel, and therefore it may ſeeme abſurde, that God ſhould vouchſafe an inward calling vnto All, ſeeing hee doth not vouchſafe an outward by the preaching

of the Goſpell. Yea▪ this were to make grace as large as nature, or (as Peter M

                  And forſaking thoſe (as Beda writeth) whom hee knoweth not for his owne, he turnes himſelfe to viſite and illustrate their hearts, whom hee hath predestinated to eternall life.
               
               In like manner Cameracenſis truely ſaith, that he giues ſome gifts of speciall grace to one, which he giues not to another;
                     In lib. ſent. 1, 4, 12. art. 2 
                  as faith, and the grace that makes a man gracious, and ſuch as are the effectes of Praedestination: and such an one is effectuall Calling.
               The ſubiect, or place wherein this worke of the ſpirit is performed, is the heart and minde. For the Holy Ghoſt by this worke doth enlightē the mind

to ſee, and incline, and mollifie the heart to yeeld, and to make anſwere to his call. The Termini or things from which, and vnto which we are called, are darkneſſe and light, vice and vertue, prophanneſſe and holineſſe. For as Paul ſaith; God hath not called vs vnto vncleanneſſe,
                  1. Theſ. 4.7 Col. 1.13. 
                  but vnto holines: and hath deliuered vs out of the power of darkneſſe, and tranſlated vs into the kingdome of his deare Sonne.
                  1. Pet 2.9 And Peter likewiſe ſheweth, that this our calling is from darkeneſſe vnto light. As by our outward calling wee are taught to relinquiſh the workes of darkneſſe,Tit. 2.14 and to follow vertue and godlines (for this the Goſpell teacheth) euen ſo by our inward and operatiue calling, we are by God inſtructed, and cauſed to abandon ſinne, and to pull our neckes out of the Diuels yoke, and to diſclaime his wayes, and on the contrarie to liſten and yeeld to God, and to ſubiect our ſelues vnto his will. The things then from which God doth call vs, are Sinne, Sathan, and the World. For theſe are enemies to his glory,

theſe coniure againſt his kingdome, theſe are enemies to our peace and welfare, & labour the downeſull and deſtruction of our ſoules.
               The ſtate whereunto we are called,
                     Rolloc. de voc. t. 1. is light, God himſelfe, and that bleſſed condition of man in Chriſt. For this condition is moſt excellent and happy, repleniſhed with much ioy, many comforts, and peace vnſpeakeable. Wee are called to holineſſe and grace, which are vndoubted forerunners of happineſſe and glory.
               We are called to God, the father of lights, the fountaine of felicitie,Iam. 1.17 the wel-ſpring of life, the giuer of all grace,Pſal. 16.11. 
                  in whoſe preſence is the fulneſſe of ioy: and at whoſe right hand there are pleaſures for euermore.
               
               The time of this calling, is either generall, or particular.
               The generall time, is in this life before death. For after death there is no calling, neither outward nor inward. God offers and confers his grace in this life onely: this is the time of mercy: after this life there is nothing but

the expectation and poſſeſſion either of happineſſe, or of miſery without poſſibilitie of mutabilitie.
               The particular time of any mans caling is not reuealed,
                     M. Perk. on Iude. 1. Acts 1.7 but layed vp in the ſecret counſell of God, in whoſe hands times and ſeaſons are. Yet the extent of the time is large enough, thogh stinted, euē the time of this life: ſome the Sixt houre, ſome at the Ninth, and others at the Eleuenth. Dauid, Iohn Baptiſt, and Timothie were called yong; Oneſimus, the Ethiopian Eunuch, and S. Auguſtine were men growne, and the Thiefe was called vpon the Croſſe, ready to die.
               Here further wee muſt vnderſtand, that when God did firſt beginne this worke of grace, wee are no way A gents,Ephe. 2.1 being dead in ſinnes, but meere Patients, God himſelfe being the onely Agent before he hath reuiued vs by his ſpirit.
                     Perk on Matth. 23 37

the leaſt ioint, neither can he. All chafing and rubbing, all ſpeech and perſwaſion, and all helpes in the world be in vaine, vnleſſe the ſoule bee restored to the bodie. Euen ſo, no perſwaſions offered to the minde, nor good deſires to the will are of any moment till the image of God standing in holineſſe, which is a conformitie to the will of God, and the very ſoule of our ſoules, begin to be reſtord. Firſt, God muſt illuminate the minde with a new light, and he muſt imprint in the will, a new qualitie or inclination, and in the heart new affections: and hee muſt giue to the will the act of wel-willing: and ſo a man being reuiued, and the wil being acted and mooued by God,Phil. 2.13. 
                  who workes the will and the deed, it also acteth and moueth by his grace. And thus the will is not meerely paſſiue, but paſſiue and actiue alſo: firſt paſſiue, and then actiue. And herevpon it is, that Prosper ſaith;
                     Contra collat. 12 
                  That which is repaired in vs, is not repaired without vs. For when God doth call and conuert vs, after that hee hath quickened vs by his Spirit, hee doth make vs anſwere

his call and deſire to come and turne vnto him. So then by the way, let vs remember to magnifie the grace of God,
                     In ſoliloq. c. 15. and to ſay as Auſten ſaith; That I fell, it was of my ſelfe: but that I roſe,

He calleth effectally whom he will: & he hardens whom he wi
                     •
                  l. And albeit he call many with an outward calling, to whom he vouchſafeth not his operatiue and inward calling, yet wee muſt not acaccuſe him of crueltie or iniuſtice, but rather admire his iudgements. It was well ſaid of that holy man;

God is our ſoueraigne Lord,Iob. 37.23. & 36.26. and tyed by no bond to any man. Wee cannot finde him out: he is excellent in power and iudgement, and abundant in iuſtice: and we know him not.

                  Phil. 1.6. 
                  that hath begun this good worke in you, vvill performe it vntill the day of Iesus Christ.
                  
                     Willet on Iude. Lect. 1 Zach. 4.9. Like as Zerubabel did both lay the foundation of the Temple, and finiſh the worke: ſo God will eſtabliſh and make perfect the worke begun in vs at our vocation. Therefore Augustine boldly affirmeth that thoſe are not in this Calling,
                  
                     Epiſt. 39 ad Paulin.
                   
                  which do not perſeuere vnto the end. Now the reaſon why thoſe that are thus called, do not fall away,
                     Perk. on Iude. 1. is foure-fold. The firſt is Gods election, which is vnchangeable, and therefore alſo faith and other the fruits of election cannot be wholly loſt and ruined.
                     Rom. 1. in. 1. Tim. 1. 
                  This (ſaith Chryſoſtome) is the propertie of faith (nunquam penitus decidit, aut omnino turbatur) it neuer wholly periſheth, neither is it altogether

troubled. The ſecond is the promiſe of God in the couenant of grace▪ in which hee promiſeth that hee will ſtand by vs,ſer. 32.42. and make vs alſo to ſtick to him. The third is the interceſſion of Chriſt, who hath prayed effectually for our cōſeruation in the world. And the fourth is becauſe we are the members and ſubiects of Chriſt,Iohn, 17.11.15.
                        •
                     0. who is a puiſſant and gratious Prince, and a moſt perfect and bleſſed Head, and therefore we may be ſure that hee wil protect and preſerue his ſubiects, profligate and extirp their enemies, and conuay ſpirituall ſenſe and motion by his ſpirit into all his members. So that if they fall, yet they ſhall not fall away: if they ſin, yet they ſin not with full conſent of will.Rom, 7, 29 For they hate & nill in part the euill, which they wil: and they doe not make a trade of ſinning, but the ſpirit remaining in them, cauſeth them to returne to God, and to recouer themſelues by true repentance. To conclude this property▪ God, when hee calles a man hee performes theſe foure workes of grace

Firſt he quickens him and giues him power to anſwere his call. Secondly, hee giues an execution of this power, and makes him to anſwere. Thirdly, he giues continuance of that power: yea and addes a fourth, which is an execution of that continuance: and ſo it comes to paſſe that none of Gods Called do fall quite away▪ but though they fall▪
                     Pſal. 37.24. yet ſhall they not be caſt off, for God putteth vnder his hand.
               
               Thirdly this vocation is a very excellent worke of God.
               For firſt, it is an vndoubted token of election:
                     Inſtit. lib. 3 cap. 24. l. 2 for God by his vocation doth (as Caluin teacheth) manifeſt his election, which otherwiſe he keepeth hidden in himſelfe. And therefore effectuall vocation may be properly called the Teſtification of Gods election.
               Secondly, Vocation is the firſt act of grace vpon the heart. Now the firſt light and libertie which a cloſe priſoner ſe
                     •
                  s and enioies, is moſt ioyous and ſolacious.
               
                  
                     Ad Paul in epiſt. 106.Thirdly, God (as Auguſtine ſpeaketh) by his election did adopt his people

to be as ſonnes: but yet we ſee that the
                        •
                      take not poſſeſſion of ſo great a benefit, vntill they be called: on the contrarie, we ſet that thoſe which are called, doe now enioy a certaine communication of their election. Vocation puts vs into an actuall poſſeſſion of Gods loue.
               Fourthly, God by calling his elect, doth (as Caluin affirmeth) admit them into his familie,
                  
                     Caluin. 16. 
                  and centoine himſelfe vnto them that they may be one.
               
               Fiftly, this inward vocation is an infallible pledge of ſaluation For God denies the ſpeciall efficacie of his ſpirit to the reprobate for the illuſtration of his ſoueraigntie and glorie;
                     Cal. eod. cap ſect. 2. and appropriates it vnto his Elect for the demō
                  ſtration of his mercie.
               Sixtly, the excellencie of the Agent doth oftentimes cōmend the act. But it is that great God, who ſwayeth the ſcepter of the whole world,1. Tim. 6.16 and dwelleth in the light that no man can atteine vnto, it is hee that inhabiteth eternity,2 Tim. 1.9. 2 Cor. 4.6. & ſpanneth the heauens with his fiſt, who calleth vs with this calling. God, that commanded the light to ſhine

out of darkeneſſe, is he, which hath ſhined in our hearts, to giue the light of the knowledge of the glorie of God in the face of Ieſus Chriſt. He, and he onely is our effectuall Caller, and neither man nor Angell.
               Seuenthly, this calling is an argument of admirable power in God, & of his infinite mercie to vs. For as he ſhewed his power in creation, in making things to bee that before were not: euen ſo hee manifeſts his power in his effectuall vocation, in calling men (that were dead in ſin, and worſe then nothing by their owne deſerts) to liue the life of grace, and in breathing into them the breath of life, which was vtterly expired by their fall in Adam. Yea the Lord may ſeeme to exhibit more power when he calles men, then when he did create him: for at his creation there was none to hinder him: but at his vocation there were many hinderers & great impedimēts, (though all inferiour vnto GOD). There is the Diuel and his ſuggeſtions: there is the World and her incantations,

ſcandals and allurements: & there is our owne fleſh, the rebellious corruption of the heart. All theſe God muſt vanquiſh, and he muſt perſwade and incline our wils, and of nillers make vs willers, before he perfit and accompliſh in vs this his glorious and thrice-happy worke of grace. Secondly this calling is a notable teſtimony of his grace and mercie to vs▪ in that it pleaſed him to ſhine vpon vs with the light of his ſpirit, and to caſt his gratious eies vpon vs, who were by ſin more loathſome then a carion, and more ſtincking then any dunghil. What are wee, that God ſhould bee mindful of vs, and viſit vs with his grace? The Starres are vncleane in hi
                        •
                      ſight: how much more man a Worme,
                  
                     
                        •
                     ob, 25, 5, 6 
                  euen the ſon of man, which is but a worme? As God declared his goodnes in creation by communicating a beeing vnto things, that had no beeing: euen ſo the ſame God doth manifeſt his mercy in vocation by miniſtring life vnto thoſe, that before were miſerable, and void of life. And indeed there is more

goodnes ſhewed, more grace exhibited in reſtoring a man out of his grieuous and inextricable miſerie, and in curing him of his curſed blindneſſe, then in giuing him a beeing, hauing none before, & in making him to ſee, hauing no ſight. To raiſe a dead ſoule from the death of ſin vnto a ſupernaturall life, is a greater worke of mercy, then to raiſe a dead body from bodily death to liue a naturall life.
               Eightly, this effectuall calling doth farre ſurpaſſe our naturall propagation or procreation. For in this we are but taken (as it were) out of our father Adam: but in the other wee are both taken out of the firſt Adam wholy corrupted, and ſet alſo into the ſecond Adam Chriſt Iesus,
                  1 Cor. 1.30 
                  Who of God is made vnto vs vviſedome, righteouſnes, ſanctification and redemption.
               
               
                  
                     M. Perk. on Iu
                           •
                        e. 1.Laſtly, this calling (that the excellencie thereof may yet appeare) ratifies all our couenants with God. Men in their Baptiſme enter couenant with God, but often ſtart from it, and will not ſtand to it, ſo as the couenant is

onely made. But when as a man is effectually called, the couenant is not onely made, but truely accompliſhed, and that on mans part, Haec clariſſ
                        •
                      Perk
               
               The fourth and laſt propertie of effectuall vocation,2. Pet. 1.10. is that it may be diſcerned by certaine ſignes thereof.
               This eſtimation or diſcerning of it, is two fold, infallible, and coniecturall.
               
               
                  Coniecturall diſcerning or determining of it, is eſpecially when in our iudgement of charitie wee deeme of others, as of the called of God, by their outward profeſſion and conuerſation in the world.Rom. 1.6.7. 
                        •
                      Cor. 1.2 And thus Paul cals the Romanes & Corinthians Sancts by calling, whereas notwithſtanding it is not vnprobable, but that there were ſome hypocrites among them. For viſible Churches are like a uet, where in is taken both good fiſh and bad: or a barne, wherein is cockle and good corne: or a garden, in which grow both ſtincking weeds and pleaſant flowers, the nettle as well as the roſe.
               The certaine and infallible diſcerning and determination made of effectuall

vocation, is either when by a ſpeciall and extraordinary reuelation from God, one man diſcernes & determines infallibly of the calling of another: this (I ſay) is performed, whē it is performed by a ſpecial work of God. For he alone vnderſtandeth the heart.Cor. 2.1
                        •
                     
                   
                  For what man knoweth the things of a man, ſaue the ſpirit of a man which is in him? All is not gold that gliſters.ſer. 17, 9 10. 
                  The heart is deceitfull & wicked aboue all things, who cā know it? I the Lord ſearch the heart and try the reiues.
               
               Or elſe ſecondly, this infallible determination and diſcerning is made, when a man determines of, and diſcernes his owne vocation by certaine workes of Gods ſpirit, which are infallible teſtimonies and tokens of it, and by which we may make our calling ſure,2. Pet. 1.10 as Poter would haue vs.
               The ſignes of effectuall Calling are theſe.
               Firſt, the Calling of God works in vs another call, whereby wee call vpon him, and ſeriouſly ſeeke vnto him and deſire his grace. Now to deſire

the helpe of grace is the beginning of grace.
                  
                     Aug. de cor. & grat. c. 7. To call vpon God conſtantly and ſincerely for his grace, is a worke of grace, and therefore an vndoubted token of our calling vnto grace.
               Secondly,D Willet on Ioh. 17.6. the attentiue hearing of the word is a marke of our effectuall vocation. For as a man is iudged to be ſicke and diſeaſed, when his ſtomack cannot brook nor digeſt wholeſome meats: ſo the ſoule of that man cannot be ſound, to whom the word of God hath no pleaſant taſt. But when a Man can ſay with the Prophet Dauid; Thy word is ſweeter to me,
                  Pſal. 19.10. & 119.14, 3 
                  then the hony or hony combe: by this we may gather an aſſured truſt that wee are giuen vnto Chriſt, if we do continue in hauing delight ſtill. For otherwiſe a ſicke man may haue ſome while a reliſh of his meat, when there is ſome intermiſſion of the diſeaſe, but it holdeth not long; ſo is it with them that haue for a while ſome taſt of the word of God, and afterward fall away; Haec Clariſſ. Will.
               
               Thirdly, the Sheepe of Chriſt are

ſuch, as are called home out of the vaſt wilderneſſe of this world vnto Chriſt their ſheepheard. Therefore by what notes theſe Sheepe are diſcerned, by the ſame a man may know his calling. Chriſt ſaith, that his ſheep know him, heare his voyce, and follow him.Iohn 10. If therefore we know, acknowledge and embrace Chriſt, if wee heare and hearken vnto his voyce to doe it, if we ſtudy to reſemble, imitate and follow him in loue, meekeneſſe patience, humilitie, iuſtice, fidelitie, trueth, confidence and compaſſion, we may aſſure our ſelues that wee are his Sheep, effectually called home into his fold.
               Furthermore, the Romanes are by Paul entituled the called of Ieſus Chriſt.
                  Rom. 1.6. The Corinthians are ſaid to bee Saints by calling.
                  1. Cor 1.2. 2. Theſ. 2.14. The Theſſalonians (ſome of them at leſt) were effectually called. Now Paul ſaith of the called Romans, that they obeyed from the hear
                        •
                      vnto the forme of the doctrine,
                  Rom. 6.17. 
                  whereunto they were deliuered. Of the called Corinthians hee ſaith, that in all things they

were made rich in Chriſt,
                  1. Cor. 1.5, 7. 
                  and were not destitute of any gift: and that howſoeuer ſome of them were before their calling notorious ſinners committing 
                     •
                  orrible and tranſcendent enormities 
                     •
                  et now ſince their calling they were raſhed and ſanctified and ſo become new men.1. Cor. 6.9, 10, 11. And as concerning the Theſſalonians he ſaith, that the Goſpel was not to them in word onely, but alſo in power,
                  1. Theſ. 1.5, 6, 9. 
                  and much aſſurance, and that they became followers of him and of the Lord, and receiued the word in much affliction, with ioy of the holy Ghoſt,
                  2. Theſ 1.3, 4. 
                  and turned to God from Idoles to ſerue the liuing and true God, and increaſed in faith and mutuall loue, and were patient & faithfull in al their perſecutions & afflictions. So then if with the Romanes we performe heartie obedience to the word: if with thoſe Corinthes, we be rich in ſpirituall graces, and haue purged our heartes by true repentance from our former iniquities▪ if we be mortified and renewed: if like thoſe good Theſſaloniās we receiue and beleeue the Goſpell, if we follow the Lord & his faithfull embaſſadours,

if we entert
                     •
                  ine the word with ioyfulneſſe notwithſtanding all afflictions, if we turne to God from all our owne Gods, our owne delights and vanities, to which wee had wedded our heartes, if our faith increaſe, and our loue abound, and if we haue patience and faith (as they had) in all our croſſes and afflictions, then may we aſſure ourſelues that wee are effectually called, as they were.
               Finally,2. Pet. 1.10. 
                  Peter, exhorting vs to giue diligence to make calling ſure, addeth that if we doe theſe things wee ſhall neuer fall.
                  Verſ 5.6.7. Now what theſe things are hee ſheweth; to wit, that they would ioint vertue with their faith, and with vertue knowledge, & with it temperance and with temperance patience, & with patience godlines, & with it brotherly kindnes, and with brotherly kindnes loue. If therfore theſe graces ſhine within vs, and bee faſt rooted in our hearts, and vnited in our liues, we may aſſure our ſoules of our effectuall calling▪ if we do theſe things, we ſhall neuer fall: and if we ſhall neuer fall, then

may wee ſafely conclude that God hath effectually called vs to light and glorie.
               And thus much concerning effectu-vocation, which is the firſt meane whereby God executeth his eternall Election.
            
            
               CHAP. 5.
               
                  
                     What Iuſtification is. All the cauſes of it. Fiue effects of it. The ſubiects and time of it. Fiue properties thereof. Foure tokens of it.
                  
               
               
                  THE ſecond is Iuſtification. For thoſe,Rom. 8.30. whom hee calleth effectually in time▪ hee alſo iuſtifieth actually in time. To iuſtifie is to repute or account one iuſt. Pro. 17.15. He which iuſtifieth the wicked, that is▪ he which reputeth and iudgeth him to be iuſt, is an abomination to the Lord. Luke 16.15. You iuſtifie your ſelues before men; that is, You would be eſteemed iuſt.
                  
To be iuſtified is to be cleared, or to bee reputed, iudged, and pronounced iuſt.
               To be iuſtified then before God, is to be reputed and eſteemed righteous in his ſight.
               Iuſtification therefore (in his proper ſignificatiō) is an Acceptance,
                  
                     Cal. inſt. l. 3. c. 11. ſ. 2. 
                  wherby God eſteemeth vs as righteous being receiued into fauour. Or
               
                  
                     Trelc. Inſtit. l. 2.Iuſtification is a iudiciall and gracious worke of God, by which hee iudgeth the Elect (being in themſelues obnoxious to the accuſation and curſe of the Law) to be iust by faith for Chriſt through the imputation of his iuſtice, and that vnto the praiſe of his glorious grace, and to their owne ſaluation.
               
               The principall efficient of Iuſtification is God the Father, in the Sonne, by the holy Spirit:Mark. 2.7. Rom. 8.33. Iſ. 43.
                        •
                     5. Greg in Pſal. poen.
                   
                  For who can forgiue ſinnes but God alone? It is God that iuſtifies. I (ſaith the Lord) euen I, am hee that putteth away thine iniquities. It 
                        〈◊〉
                      meet that he ſhould be our pardoner, who was our Creator, and that he ſhould bee the giuer of grace, who was to all the author

of nature.
                  
                     Trelc. Inſt. l. 2. 
                  It is his office to abſolue the guiltie, by whoſe iustice hee was made guiltie: It belōgs to him to pronounce a man to be iuſt, whoſe will is the rule of iuſtice: it is his prerogatiue to giue ſentence of life and death, becauſe he is by nature, right, and office the higheſt Iudge.
               
               The inſtrument, whereby the benefit of Iuſtification is offered and proclaimed, is the Goſpel:Acts. 5.20. Act. 13.16. 2. Cor. 5.
                        •
                     8. which therefore is called the word of life, the word of ſaluation, the word and miniſterie of Reconciliation.
               
               The outward inſtruments▪ whereby our iuſtification is ſealed and confirmed to vs, are the two Sacramentes,Rom. 4.11. and thereupon Circumciſion is called the Seale of the righteousneſſe of faith.
               
               The inward Sealer of our iuſtification is the Holy Ghoſt, who teſtifieth and ſealeth it to our conſciences ſo as that we may perſwade our hearts of it
               The Miniſters, and liuely inſtruments, for the proclaiming, teſtifying and pronouncing our iuſtification to vs are the Meſſengers and Prophets of the Lord, according to that of Chriſt▪
                  
                  whoſe ſinnes ye remit,
                  Matth. 18.18. 
                  they ſhall be remitted to them: and whoſe ye retaine they ſhall be retained.
               
               The onely internall inſtrument, whereby we apprehend and receiue the grace of iuſtification offered vnto vs by God,
                     Perk. on gal. 2.20. is a true ſauing faith.
               
               Iuſtifying faith is a gift whereby wee apprehend Chriſt and his benefits.
               
               Or, it is a worke of Gods Spirit in the heart, whereby we receiue and lay hold on Chriſts obedience, for the pardon of our ſinnes with God, and his accepting of vs as righteous in his 
                     •
                  ight.
               The authour of faith is God. For vnto vs It is giuen to beleeue.
                  Phil. 1.29. 
                  This is the worke of God (ſaith Chriſt) that yee beleeue in him whom hee hath ſent. Faith both begun and finiſhed is the gift of God, as Auſten truly teacheth.Ioh. 6.29. De praed. c. 9. 1. Cor. 13.13. 1. Tim 1.5. Ioh. 1.12. Gal. 3.14.
               
               The proper forme and life of faith is not charitie, which is a diſtinct gift of God, and a fruite of vnfeigned Faith, but the Apprehenſion and Application of Chriſt, and his benefites vnto our ſelues particularly.
               
                  The proper obiect of a ſauing faith is Ieſus Chriſt, God-man,1. Tim. 2

                     In 10. Pſal.
                   
                  My whole faith is in Chriſt: by him alone I beleeue that I am iuſtified and ſaued.

               Now to be iuſtified by faith, is to be iuſtified of God for the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt apprehended by faith:
                     Inſtit. l 3. c. 11 ſ. 2. or (as Caluin ſpeaketh) he ſhall be iuſtified by faith, who being excluded from the righteouſneſſe of works, apprehendeth the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt by faith, wherewith he being inuested doth appeare in the ſight of God as righteous, and

                     ot a ſinner.
               
               So that faith doth iuſtifie in reſpect of her obiect onely, and not as any meritorious or proper efficient of iuſtification.

And this faith, be it weake or ſtrong, is yet able

to receiue the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt: euen as a palſie or ſhaking hand, may receiue a iewel of a king as truely, though not ſo firmely, as the hand that is whole and ſound.
               And further, this ſauing faith is the onely hand, whereby wee doe receiue Chriſt and his merites.Gal. 2.16. 
                  No man is iuſtified by the workes of the Law, but by the faith of Ieſus Chriſt.

                  Chriſoſtom ſaith; Without faith no man hath obtained life: but I am able to ſhew that a faithfull man both liued and obtained the kingdom of heauen without workes. For the thiefe did onely beleeue, and was iuſtified. It was well ſaid by Roffenſis▪ Fides faeta bonis operibus, iustificat ante partum: Faith being bigge with good works,

                     uſtificatum. 
                  doth iuſtifie a man before it bring them forth. For as S. Auguſtine ſaith; Good works doe not goe before him, that is, to be iuſtified, but follow him that i
                        •
                      already iuſtified. And though good

workes muſt neuer bee ſeuered from faith in the perſon iuſtified, yet they muſt be ſundred in the act of iuſtification. Though the eie bee not alone, yet it ſees alone: and though the head conſult & inuent alone, yet it is not alone, but ioyned to the body: ſo though faith be not alone in the faithfull man, yet it alone doth iuſtifie.
               And thus wee ſee how to eſteeme of faith, the Sacraments, and the Miniſters of God, alwaies remembring to aſcribe our iuſtification vnto God, Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghoſt,Matth. 6.12 Eph. 4.32. 1. Cor. 6.11. In Rom. 4. & 5. as the proper and principall efficient thereof, as the Scriptures teach vs▪ and confeſſing with Primaſius, that God doth iuſtifie the wicked (per ſolam fidem) by faith alone, and not by workes.
               
               The internall impulſiue cauſe of Iuſtification (which mooueth God to iuſtifie vs) is his grace and meere beneuolence and not our works paſt, preſent, or to come, how glorious ſo euer. Paul ſaith, we are iuſtified freely by his grace,
                  Rom. 3.24. In Pſal 30 And Auguſtine ſaith, that it is the ineffable grace 
                        •
                     f God, that hee which is guilty

ſhould be iuſtified. Becauſe all men are ſhut vp vnder ſinne: the ſaluation of man (as Anſelme ſaith) doth not now conſist in the merits of men,
                  
                     Comment in Rom. c. 11 
                  but in the mercie of God. Yea Bellarmine himſelfe ingeniouſly confeſſeth that by reaſon of the vncertenty of our owne righteouſneſſe,
                     De inſt. l. 5. c. 7. and the danger of vaine glory (Iutiſſimum eſt) it is the ſafest courſe to repoſe our (fiduciam) Whole confidence (in ſolu De
                        •
                      miſericordia) in the Sole mercie and goodneſſe, of God.
               
               Now then we muſt not imagine that this grace of God is procured by our workes, but that it doth proceed freely from the Lord. No merit of man (ſaith Anſelme) doth goe before the grace of God.
                     In 5. c. Rom
                   
                  Thou hast done no good (ſaith Auguſtine) and yet remiſsion of ſinnes is giuen thee.

                  Let thy works be marked, and they are found euill. If God ſhould reward thoſe workes according to their due▪ he ſhould condemne them. But God doth not giue thee the puniſhment that is due, but giues thee grace,
                  
                     Do not & grat. cont. Pel. cap. 4.

yeares can be ſaued, is not payed by deſerts, but giuen without deſert: and thereupon is called grace.
               
               The externall impulſiue cauſe▪ or meritorious efficient of our iuſtification is not our owne workes, virtues or obedience. Firſt becauſe they bee the Lords due, by vertue of many bonds.Luk. 17.10. When we haue done all that is biddē vs, we haue done but our due, no more then wee were bound to due. Now ſhall wee thinke that the diſcharging of one duetie can ſatisfie Gods iuſtice for the omiſſion of many dueties, and the commiſſion of many faults?

                  Augustine ſaith that ſorrowes before pardon of ſins are the puniſhments of ſinners: but after pardon, they are the trials and exerciſes of iust men. And ſo for death it ſelfe, the ſting and ſtrength thereof, which is ſin, is aboliſhed by the death of Chriſt vpon the croſſe,1 Cor, 15 56. Rom, 4.25, & therefore is to bee reputed but as a triall or chaſtiſement, whereby the Lord doth teach vs humilitie and the flight of ſinne, and doth exerciſe and proue our faith, fortitude and patience.
               And though in reſpect of ſinne it be the entrance of Hell, yet through the death of Chriſt, it is become the gate of heauen, and as Cyprian ſpeaketh

(Ianua vitae) the dore of life. It doth (as it were) conuey vs out of the wildernes into Canaan, out of a troubleſome Sea into a quiet hauen, and out of earth into heauen, from woe to weale, and from men to God: yea it becomes the death of ſinne, that firſt gaue life to it.
                     De Chriſt. rel. par. 2. We conclude therefore this truth with Vrſinus, ſaying, God doth not hate vs, neither hath he a will to puniſh vs for thoſe ſins for which Chriſt hath ſufficiently ſatisfied: in whom alſo we haue remiſſion of thoſe, (ſins of omiſſion) and all other our ſins, ſo that by his onely merit we are reputed righteous before God.
               
               The ſecond part of Iuſtification is Gods gracious acceptation, wherby he doth for the merit of Chriſts actiue obedience by faith receiued of vs, account vs iuſt and pure, and honours vs with the crowne of life. And in this reſpect we may truely be ſayed to be iuſt, perfect and holie men: becauſe we ſtand clothed with the moſt perfect righteouſnes of Chriſt, which is reputed ours, in which, appearing before our heauenly father, wee doe receiue

a bleſſing, as Iacob did of Iſaack,
                  Gen 27.15 27. hauing on his elder brothers garmēts. Neither muſt it ſeeme ſtrange vnto vs that we ſhould be accepted righteous for the righteouſnes of an other. For albeit this righteouſneſſe be Chriſts, primarily and by way of inherence, yet it is ours by Gods donation and by the application of faith;

               The forme or formall cauſe of Iuſtification is not faith, loue, nor any other vertue, neither is it an infuſed quality, or habituall ſanctity inherent in vs. For this were to confound iuſtification and ſanctification, which are very different acts,

Now God is ſaid to impute the righteouſnes of Chriſt vnto a man, when hee doth adiudge, decree and giue it to him, and account and reckon it as his owne, and for the merit and worthines of it doth pardon & acquite him, and repute him righteous.Epiſt. ad Diog

                  We are the righteouſnes of God in him, as he is ſin in vs, to vvit, by imputation. With whom conſenteth Vrſinus, the imputation of the righteouſnes of Chriſt is not the transfuſion of righteouſnes or of qualities into vs, but the abſolution from ſins in the iudgement of God, for the righteouſnes of an other. For iuſtification and remiſſion of ſins are the ſame. For to iuſtifie is for God not to impute ſin vnto vs, but to accept vs for righteous, & to abſolue or pronounce vs iuſt for the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt imputed.
               
               The end of Iuſtification in reſpect of God, is the glory of God in an admirable compoſition of iuſtice and

mercie; of iuſtice, becauſe hee would haue his ſonne to ſatisfie for our ſins, rather then that they ſhould eſcape vnpuniſhed; and of mercie, becauſe it pleaſed him to impute and appropriate the ſatisfaction of his ſonne vnto vs, rather then we wretches ſhould be deſtroyed.Ob. But ſome will perhaps imagine that God ſhewed neither iuſtice, nor mercie: no iuſtice, becauſe he puniſhed an innocent for the nocent, & ſet his teeth on edge, whereas they had eaten the ſoure grapes: and no mercie, becauſe hee forgaue none without a ſatisfaction.Anſ. It is true indeed that the innocent was puniſhed: but yet it was done willingly, and not by conſtraint▪ and he was of the ſame nature with the nocent, and was alſo ſuch a potent innocent, as that he did ſatisfie the iuſtice of the Iudge to the vtmoſt, and conquer all his puniſhments with facilitie. Neither muſt we deeme the mercie of God to be withheld, or not exhibited becauſe he did not forgiue without a ſatisfaction For firſt, it was of his ſole benignitie and perfect mercie,

without the preuiſion of any merit, that he came to ſatisfie, who made the ſatisfaction for vs.1 Ioh. 4.10 
                  Herein (ſaith Iohn) is that loue, not that we loued God, but that he loued vs, and ſent his ſonne to be a reconciliation for our ſins. Secondly, it is his grace that hee doth apply the ſatisfaction of his ſonne vnto vs, who were diſpoſed thereunto by no gift, or merit. Thirdly, we muſt conſider that Gods iuſtice is ſo infinitely abſolute, as that we could not bee iuſtified without a Mediator.Note. God could not forgiue ſinne without a ſatisfaction. For otherwiſe what need was there that the ſoone of GOD ſhould be brought (as he was) to ſuch horrible miſerie and to ſuch an accurſed death? A kinde father would try any way, rather then he would expoſe his owne and onely ſonne to extreame terrors and miſerie.

And ſuch debts are ſins, at vvhich infringe the rule of Gods eternall vvill, & are enemies to it, ſo as that they cannot be purged and forgiuen vvithout a penaltie, but Gods iustice and vprightnes vvill bee diminiſhed.
               
               But yet though his mercie could not ſhoulder out his iuſtice, or any whit eclipſe it, yet his iuſtice did not bereaue him of his mercie. For of his ovvne meere mercie hee found out the way to redeeme and ſaue vs, when

we did not ſo much as thinke of any ſuch thing, and therefore as we ought to admire the ſeueritie of his iuſtice: ſo we ſhould alſo magnifie his endles grace and mercie.
               The endes of Iuſtification in reſpect of our ſelues are▪ that we may be pleaſing vnto God, that wee may haue peace of conſcience, and true tranquilitie of minde, that being redeemed from miſerie wee might bee ſaued, and finally that wee ſhould ſtriue againſt the ſtreame of our owne corruptions, and keepe a conſtant courſe in pietie: or (to vſe the words of Zacharie) That wee being deliuered out of the handes of our enemies,
                  Luke 1.74.75. 
                  ſhould ſerue him without feare all the daies of our life, in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe before him.
                  Tit. 14. For Chriſt gaue himſelfe for vs, that wee ſhould be zealous of good vvorkes: and bare our ſinnes on the croſſe, that vve being dead to ſinne,
                  1. Pet. 2.2 4 
                  ſhould liue is righteouſneſſe.
                  
                     Loc. 31. quaſt. 44. To this end (ſaith Bucanus) are wee iuſtified by faith for Chriſt, that the old man being aboliſhed by the efficacie of

Chriſt crucified, Chriſt may liue in vs, and wee by the ſtudy of good workes, may ſhew our ſelues thankefull vnto God for ſo great a benefite. Therefore Paul almoſt in all his Epiſtles, drawes his doctrine of ſanctification and good workes, out of the doctrine of Faith or Iuſtification, as the effect out of the cauſe, or as an neceſſarie conſequent from the Antecedent: H
                        •
                     c, ille. In like maner Augustine ſaith:
                     Tom. 4. lib. 1 ad ſimplic. Reſp ad 2. quaeſt.
                   
                  Chriſt died for the vvicked, but not that the wicked ſhould remaine dead, but that being iuſtified, they ſhould be conuerted from vvickedneſſe, beleeuing in him vvhich iuſtifieth the vngodly. For God hateth impietie. And againe: Grace doth iuſtifie (or hee iuſtifies by grace) that he which is iuſtified might like iuſtly▪
                   So then one maine end of our iuſtificatiō is, that abandoning all iniquitie we ſhould lead our liues in ſanctitie▪
               
               The effects and conſequents of Iuſtification are diuers.
               
                  The immediate effect of Iuſtification is adoption,
                  
                     Reck Syſt. Th. li. 3. c. 7 
                  by vvhich the Elect doe now actually pleaſe God, as his ſonnes and coheires

of Chriſt For ſo ſoone as the Electare abſolued from their ſinnes, they are foorthwith adopted into the right 
                     •
                  nd priuiledges of the children of God.
               A ſecond effect of Iuſtification, is peace of conſcience: to wit, when we perceiue our ſelues to be deliuered from our ſins, before Gods iudgemēt ſeat, and the iudgement of our owne conſcience.Rom. 8 1. Rom. 5.1. For there is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt: and being iuſtified by faith, wee haue peace vvith God, euen that peace,Col. 4.7. 
                  vvhich paſſeth all vnderſtanding: whereas there is no true peace to the wicked: but they are like the raging ſea that cannot reſt,
                  Iſ 57.20. 
                  vvhoſe waters caſt vp mudde and mire: or elſe they are ſtructen with a ſpirituall Apoplexcy, which hath reaued them of all true ſenſe, and are ſo benummed in their conſcience, that they can feele nothing till it be rouſed and awaked.
               Thirdly, our iuſtification makes vs haue acceſſe to God by prayer, with confidence to be heard for Chriſt For ſinne was the Make-bate and wall of

partition, betwixt God and vs: now our ſinnes are done away, when wee are iuſtified, and therefore with boldneſſe wee may approach vnto the throne of Grace.Rom 8.15. 
                  We haue now receiued the Spirit of adoption,

                     ſe things vve ſtand in need of.
               
               Fourthly, Iuſtification begets patience in afflictions, and makes a man reioice in the middeſt of tribulations.
               Being iuſtified by Faith, wee haue peace to Godward▪
                  Rom. 5.1, 3 
                  Neither that only, but alſo we reioice in tribulations, knovving that tribulation produceth patience: to wit, through the perſwaſion of our reconciliation vnto God, and our aſſurance that all things,Rom 8.28. how bitter and grieuous ſoeuer, doe worke for the beſt vnto them that loue God, and are pleaſing to him.
               Laſtly, Glorification is an inſeparable companion, and a notable effect

of Iuſtification. Being freed from ſinne and made ſeruants vnto God,
                  Rom. 6.22. 
                  yee haue your fruit in holineſſe, and the end euerlaſting life. The obedience of Chriſt by grace imputed to vs, and by Faith receiued of vs, workes in vs a deſire, care, and endeuour to obey God. His death for which our ſins are remitted, works in vs another death, whereby wee die to ſinne▪ And his glorious righteouſneſſe, wherewith wee are inueſted, and made to bee reputed righteous, doth merit for vs eternall life and glorie.
               The ſubiect of Iuſtification, or the perſons, that are iuſtified, or to whom Iuſtification doth belong, are the Elect of God, & the ſheep of Chriſt: euen all that are predeſtinated vnto life. For therefore the Scriptures ſpeak on this ſort:Iſ 53.6. 
                  The Lord hath laied vpon him the iniquitie of vs all.
                  Ioh. 10.15 
                  I laie dovvne my life for my ſheepe. Whom hee did predeſtinate, hee hath alſo iuſtified.
                  Rom 8.30, 32. 
                  Who ſpared not his owne Sonne, but gaue him for vs all: how ſhall he not vvith him giue vs all things alſo? But for what vs?

(ſaith Auguſtine) Euen for them vvhich are fore-knowen,
                  
                     In Io
                           •

                  praedeſtinated, iuſtified and glorfiied. Haimo ſaith: Chriſt hath taken avvaie in the Elect, not onely originall ſinne,
                  
                     In Leuit. l. 17. c. 2. 
                  but all actuall offences alſo, and hath moreouer giuen the euerlasting life Radnulphus alſo ſaith: that the blood of the High-prieſt Chriſt vvas the expiation of all Beleeuers.
               
               I adde further, that the Elect are the onely perſons, to whom this worthy worke of God belongs, and none but they.
                  Iſ 53.11, 12 Matth. 26.28. Heb. 9.28. Firſt, the Scripture is euident: By his knowledge ſhall my righteous ſeruant iuſtifie Manie. He bare the ſinne of manie. His blood vvas ſhed for manie for the remiſsion of ſins. Hee vvas once offered to take awaie the ſinnes of manie The Scripture ſaith, Manie, and not All,
                  Matth. 1.21. without the exception of any. Thou ſhall call his Name Ieſus: for he ſhal ſame his people from their ſinnes. Now all are not his. For his people are his ſheep: and his ſheepe are the deuils Goaets: all are not his ſheepe. Yee beleeue not,
                  Ioh. 10.26. (ſaith Chriſt) for yee are not of my ſheepe. Some men haue neuer

faith, therefore ſome are neuer iuſtified. Secondly for whom Chriſt did not pray,Perk. de praed. for them hee did not ſacrifice: becauſe to intercede and to ſacrifice are conioyned.
               But Chriſt prayed onely for the Elect and for Beleeuers, and in praying, did offer himſelfe to the Father.Ioh. 17.9, 19, 20. This is don by ſacrificing himſelf, and making his ſacrifice meritorious.
                   
                  I praie for them (ſaith Chriſt) I praie not for the world, but for them, which thou haſt giuē me: for they are thine. And for their ſakes I ſanctifie my ſelfe. I praie not for theſe alone, but for them alſo which beleeue in me. Origen ſaith accordingly (Hom. 9. in Leuit.) that Chriſt prayth Onelie for thoſe which are the Lordes portion. Auguſtine ſaith: There is a world of the damned: for this world Chriſt praieth not. And there if a world of thoſe that are to be ſaued: for this world Chriſt praieth. And likewiſe Cyrill:
                  
                     In Io
                           •
                         lib 11 cap. 14. 
                  The Lord Ieſus putting a difference betwixt his and ſuch as were not his: for thoſe onelie (ſaith he) I praie, which keepe my word and haue taken my yoke. For to whom he is a Mediatour and High-prieſt, on them only he bestowes the benefit of Meditation
                  
Therefore the Elect and faithfull are only iuſtified & redeemed by Chriſt.
               
                  Perk. de praed.Thirdly, Chriſt gaue himſelfe, that he might ſanctifie to himſelfe a peculiar people, that is, a people ſelected out of others as a precious treaſure, and his owne proper goods. Therefore it was not Chriſts intention, to giue himſelfe to be a ranſome for all, and euery one alike.
               Laſtly, regeneration and life eternall belong not to all. All men doe not die to ſinne, and liue to God: and the kingdome of God ſhall be giuen to them,Matth. 20 23. Reu. 22.15 Rom. 8.30. 
                  for whom it is preprared. Many ſhall be excluded. Therefore all are not iuſtified. For they that are iuſtified, ſhalbe alſo glorified. Iſychius ſaith;
                     In Leuit. l. 6. c. 23. that Chriſt who ſuffered for vs, hath deliuered vs from ſinne and from the bondage of it. And Auguſtine more plainly:
                     Serm. 44. de ver. 6. Apoſt.
                   
                  Euerie one that is generated, is damned: and no man is deliuered, but he, that is regenerated. And againe, God gaue a great price,
                  
                     Serm 109. 
                  & bought thoſe, whom he doth reuiue. It is manifeſt therefore that the Elect are onely partakers

of the merits of Chriſt, and iuſtified in the ſight of God. For whereas Chriſt is ſaid to take awaie the ſinnes of the world,

               It is true indeed (I grant) that the obedience of Chriſt (being the obedience of God) was in it ſelf ſufficient to haue procured the Iuſtification of all without exception: but if wee reſpect either Gods decree, or Chriſts intention, it is appropriated to the Elect, and belongs to none but them.

Howſoeuer his blood and merits were in themſelues ſufficient for the iuſtification and ſaluatition of all men, yet they did not effectually procure them for all, but onely for the Elect, to whom they were ordained and intended, and of whom alone they can bee rightly receiued and embraced.
               Now thoſe that are iuſtified, muſt be conſidered in a double condition.
               
                  One, according to nature,

                  According to nature they are ſinners (for he iuſtifieth the vngodly, Rom. 4.5.) and therefore obnoxious to the accuſation, and malediction of the Law (for curſed is euery man that continueth not in al things,Gal 3.10. which are witten in the Law to doe them.) But according to ſupernaturall grace, they are beleeuers: or ingrafted into Chriſt by faith. For the righteouſneſſe of God, is made manifeſt by the faith of Ieſus Chriſt

               Secondly, Iuſtification is a moſt free act▪ performed freely by God without coaction, or the leaſt inducement by any dignitie preſent, or foreſeen to be in vs hereafter. For being abſolute Lord of all, hee may ſhew mercie on whom he liſts. We are by nature all the children of wrath,

                  als of the deuill, deſtitute of all true grace and ſubiect to the curſe: and therefore it is a wonder that wee are not all conſumed. We muſt needs then confeſſ, that the free grace of God in Chriſt hath made the difference.

                  In ep. Rom And Theodulus ſaith: Chriſt is the Author of righteouſneſſe, to them that beleeue in him, euen vnto them that had done nothing righteouſlie. Here then by the way wee may remember,

that our Iuctification is free, in regard of vs, that did not deſerue it: and free alſo in reſpect of God, who did freely deuiſe & diſpoſe the means therof and freely workes faith within vs, by which wee doe apply it to vs. But it is not free, but iuſtly performed in regard of Chriſt, who by his all-ſufficient merits did deſerue it, and by deſert acquire it.
               Thirdly, Iuſtification is one abſolute, entire, and indiuiduall act.

Now though Iuſtification bee a moſt perfect and plenary worke of God, yet we come to the full perſwaſion of it but by degrees: and though God at once forgiue a man his ſinnes by an abſolute act, which admits neither increaſe nor decreaſe▪ yet that man receiues his pardon by ſuch a faith, or ſuch a perſwaſion of faith, as is not alwaies one, but ſometimes ſtronger, ſometmies

And all this proceedeth from the roote and iuice of Gods grace, for that the bountifulnes, loue and goodnes of Chriſt, hath ſprinckled and repleniſhed his heart with ſweetenes and loue, that it is a pleaſure and ioy for him to do good to his Neighbour, and is greeued for his ſins, as Samuel for Saul.
               
               By theſe and ſuch like workes of grace, a man may come to a certaine knowledge of his Iuſtification. Which how well worthy it is of our knowledge, they can beſt tell, which feele.

               Glorification is the communication or free donation of true holineſſe and happineſſe to them, that are elected, called and iuſtified. For glorie comprehendeth in it both holines & happineſſe. Holines is one degree of happineſſe, and happines is the higheſt degree of holineſſe. No man is holy, but the ſame is happy: and no mā can be happy, but he muſt bee holie Grace is the inchoation of glorie, and glorie is the conſummation of grace He that ſits in the throne of grace, is truely intituled to the crowne of glorie: and it is one point of glorie to be a man of grace A gracious man may be rightly ſtiled a glorious man.
               Glorification then comprehendeth in it two things, Sanctification in this world,

                   and the collation of eternall happineſſe in the world to come. Of both theſe we will intreat in order.
               Sanctification or Regeneration is a benefit of God, whereby our corrupt nature is renewed to the image of god

by the Holy Ghoſt, Polan. Part. The lib. 1. Or ſanctification is an inward change of a man iuſtified wherby the image of God is reſtored in him.
               
                  Hippocrates ſaith of Phiſick that it is an adiection, and a ſubraction;Lib, de flatibus. & Adiection of things wanting, and a Subtraction of things redounding in the bodies of men. Euen ſo ſanctification is a remouing of the corrupt humors of our ſoules, and an adiection or infuſion of ſpirituall graces, which are wanting. It was excellently ſaid by one.M. Greeneham.
               
               
                  The wiſe men (ſaith he) which were expert in nature, could ſay that in euerie generation there is a corruption. And we ſee that the ſeede ſowen is much changed before it grow vp, and beare fruit. Then needfull it is that in regeneration there be a corruption of ſin, ſo that as the ſeed in the ground, ſo ſinne in our mortall bodies may decay, that the new man may be raiſed vp, the Spirit of God taking poſſeſſion of our ſoules.
               
               Now this transformation of a man

is very requiſit to ſaluation.Heb. 12.14. For without holines no man ſhall ſee God. If wee will not liue to God by grace vpon the earth, wee ſhall not liue in glorie with him in the heauens. If wee will not die to ſin in this world,Ezek. 18.31 Rom. 6.23. wee ſhall not eſcape death, the wages of ſin, in the world to come. If we doe not liue to God in holineſſe in this life, wee ſhall not liue in happines with God in the life to come. It is not onely neceſſary in him that is to be ſaued, that ſinne be aboliſhed by remiſſion, but that it bee likewiſe mortified by regeneration. Neither is it onely requiſit that a man ſtand righteous by the imputation of righteouſneſſe, but that a man alſo be righteous by the infuſion of righteouſnes.
               Sanctification is not deriued to vs from our parents. For parents muſt be conſidered two waies. Firſt as they are Man, the children of Adam. Secondly as they are holy men, ſonnes of the ſecond Adam: and thus they doe not beget their children, though their holineſſe bee a meanes to make them

to be reputed holy with men,1 Cor. 7.14 and accounted the children of the Church. But they produce their children as they are men, and corrupted in their father Adam, and ſo conuey nature corrupted in Adam to them, although they be regenerated. Take wheat,
                  
                     M. Perk. on Iude. 1. 
                  make it as clean as you can, ſowe it and it will come vp, not as it was ſowen, but in ſtalk, blade and eare, and it brings vp as much chaffe, as euer it did, though none vvere ſowen with it. Euen ſo parents though ſanctified by grace, do bring forth childrē, that are vnholie.
               
               But the fountaine and proper Efficient of our ſanctification and holines is almightie God,Ephe. 2, 10 
                  whoſe workemanſhip we are, created in Chriſt Ieſus vnto good workes,
                  Col. 1.13.

                  in whom he hath quickned vs through his loue, and hath lifted him vp with his right hand to giue repentance vnto Iſrael.
                  Act. 5.31. And albeit our Sanctification be the worke of the whole Trinitie, yet it is immediately performed by the holy ghoſt:

therefore by a peculiar epithet hee is called Holy, and we are ſaid to be borne of the Spirit,

And to the Southerne, becauſe hee doth comfort vs with his warme blaſts, and moiſten vs with his ſweete ſhowers, and diſſolue our froſt bitten affections, & make vs to ſprout vp and looke freſh like flowers.

               The inſtruments, which he vſeth to this purpoſe are the word and ſacraments. Gods word is compared to fire and to an hammer.Ier. 23.29.

Or it is a work of the ſpirit, by which true Chriſtian habits, virtues, and diſpoſitions are infuſed & encreaſed in vs. And this ſubſtitution of good, or Quickening is,Perk. ib. 
                  Where Chriſt dwels and raignes in our hearts by his spirit: ſo as we can ſay, we hencefoorth liue not, but Christ in vs.
               
               The ground of this, is the vertue of Chriſts reſurrection, or the power of his God-head raiſing vp his Man head, & releaſing him of the puniſhment and tyrannie of our ſinnes: which vertue and power is as a Reſtoratiue to reſtore and quicken vs, that we might liue vnto God in holineſſe and newneſſe of life.

               Viuificatiō is of the New man, which is the nature of man refined and reſtored to the image of God: and this is deriued from Adam the ſecond,Col. 2.3.

                     ▪ knowledge and holineſſe.
               
               The forme of Sanctification is the very tranſlation and alteration of the heart and life: or a ſpirituall reduction and conuerſion of a man by God from the vncleannes of ſinne, to true puritie and Chriſtian ſanctitie.
               The endes of our Sanctification are the glorie of God, the ſaluation of our ſoules, the edification of our Brethren, the beautifying of our honorable proſeſſion and calling, the ſilencing of Athieſts and prophane Mockgods, the alluring of others vnto God & godlines, & that we might bee ſomething like God our father▪ and Chriſt our elder brother, and gather aſſurance to our ſoules that we
                     •
                   are in the ſtate of life.
               The effects of Sanctification are firſt the true loue of God, our ſelues,

and our neighbours. Secondly, a ſerious deſire to doe all good duties, and to auoyd all the courſes of ſinne and wickednes. Thirdly it makes him, that is ſanctified, to couet and labour for the renouation and conuerſion of others. Finally, it is the roote of all thoſe good fruites wee bring foorth and beare. For if the fountaine bee altogether corrupt and foule, the waters muſt needs be alſo naught and fithy. For who can bring a cleane thing out of filthineſſe? There is not one. But when a man is once truely ſanctified, though not fully, the good workes he doth, are then truely holy, though not fully.
               The Subiects of Sanctification, or or the perſons ſanctified, are ſuch as are elected, called and iuſtified: and therfore the Apoſtle ſaith,Rom. 8.30. that whom God predeſtinated, called and iuſtified, he did alſo glorifie. Theſe and none but theſe are truely ſanctified. For God ſanctifies thoſe only, whom he maketh to be Temples of his ſpirit: but all men are not ſuch: yea, there are

a number in the world, that ſit in perpetuall darkneſſe, and worſhip the very deuill. Indeed a Reprobate may ſeeme holy, but he is not holy, but is like a faire apple rotten in the heart: or to a wound that hath a skin drawen ouer it, but yet feſters inwardly. And they may liue amongſt Gods holy one (as Frogs and fiſhes in one pond) but they are not of them, but indeed pertaine to another ſtate.
               
                  1. Cor. 1 30And finally, Chriſt is ſanctification to thoſe onely, to whom hee is wiſedome, righteouſneſſe, and redemption: which he is not vnto all, but vnto his owne people onely.
               Now why Chriſt doth not communicate holineſſe vnto all, as Adam did corruption,
                     Danaeus de n
                           •
                        t. l. 2. c. 16 the reaſon is, becauſe the maner, by vvhich Adam doth communicate his euils vnto all and euery one, is naturall, to wit, generation, and humane nature: but the maner by which Chriſt doth communicate his benefits, is ſupernaturall: to wit, faith, and the grace of God, whereof all men are not pertakers: for it dependeth on Gods Election. Therefore

whoſoeuer haue humane nature, the ſame are ſinners. But they onely are renewed, who are poſſeſſed of faith.
               
               Furthermore, thoſe which are ſanctified, muſt be conſidered in a twofold eſtate: firſt, as they are in themſelues till God doe worke vpon them, and that is, lothſome and vgly, dead in ſinnes and treſpaſſes.Ephe. 2.5. 
                  Euen when we were dead in ſins, hath hee quickned vs together in Chriſt. Secondly, as they are made by grace, & that is a royall prieſthood,1. Pet. 2. 9 1. Cor. 3.16, 17 an holy nation, and the Temples of God, and of his Spirit.
               
               Finally, theſe things are worthy to be knowen concerning the regenerate. Firſt, their Countrey,

                        •
                      Grynaeo. which is heauen: Secondly, their Parents, to wit, the holy Ghoſt and the Church: Thirdly, their Eſſentiall parts, theſe are an intelligent ſoule and an organicall body: Fourthly their food, which is the word of God: Fiftly, their diſpoſition or condition, & that in the minde is a diuine light, and reformation in heart: Sixtly their war-fare or indeuours, which is the flight of the pleaſures

of the fleſh, and of fleſhly vanities: Seauenthly their Religion, and that is true godlineſſe, and faith in Chriſt: Laſtly their conſummation, which is eternall life.
               The obiects, or two termes of Sanctification, are corruption and ſinne to bee diminiſhed and extirped: and Chriſtian holineſſe to bee planted, inpired and augmented.
               The ſubiect in vvhich this ſanctification is wrought,
                     
                        •
                     . Theſ. 5.23. is the vvhole man according to both ſoule and body, yea, and life alſo. Yet here by this way we muſt obſerue that ſanctification doth not alter the ve
                     •
                  y ſubſtance of a man, but onely his corupt and ſinfull qualities.
                     M. Perk. on 
                           •
                        ude. 1. 
                  It rectifieth, but aboliſheth not affections. It corrects and moderates mirth, and ſorow, and ſuch humane paſſions, but takes them not quit away, It tunes the iarring ſtrings of a mans heart, but it breakes them not in peeces. Euen as the fall of man did not aboliſh a mans eſſence, but corrupt his faculties, euen ſo the raiſing vp, and the renouation of a man doth

not a
                     •
                  ter his very ſubſtance, but doth onely change his corrupted qualities and powers.
               Now the Sanctification of the ſoule conſiſt firſt in the alteration of the minde, whreby ignorance is by little and little aboliſhed, and the mind inlightened to know the true God and his mercie in Chriſt, and to know a mans ſelfe and to ſee his ſecret corruptions againg the 
                     •
                  aw, and to know how to behaue himſelfe vnto God and man: a
                     •
                   alſo to approoue the things of God, and to minde and meditate on things ſpirituall and celeſtiall.Perk. ib.
               
               Secondly it conſiſts in the renouation of the will. Which is when God giues grace truely to will good: as to beleeue, fear, and obey God. But yet this will is weake and not without reſiſtance and contention made by the fleſh,Perk. ib.
               
               Thirdly, it conſiſtes in the ſanctification of the memorie, which is an openeſſe by grace to keepe good things, ſpecially the doctrine of ſaluation.
               
               
                  Fourthly, it ſtands in the regeneration of the conſcience, as when it is fitted to giue true teſtimony to a mans heart of the remiſſion of his ſinnes, and of his care to ſerue God.
               Fiftly, it conſiſts in a ſpirituall tranſformation of the affections, as loue, ioy, ſadnes, anger, feare and ſuch like, whereby a man that is iuſtified, doth ſo temper them by his reaſon refined, and by the light of the Law, with the helpe of Gods Spirite, that they doe not breake out (as in the wicked, that giue the reignes to their luſts) but may bee held in ſome good order; howbeit in this life, this is done with much ſtrife & reluctation, and is rather affected then effected.
               Sixtly, it conſiſts in the ſanctificatiō of the appetite or deſires,
                     Keck. Syſt. Tho. 3.6.9 
                  by which a man iuſtified obtaineth conformitie with good reaſon and Gods law in the deſiring of meat, and in other things which appertaine to the appetite:Perk. ib. Or the ſanctification of the appetite ſtands in the holy ordering of our deſires in meat, drinke, apparell,

riches, &. And in the practiſe of three main vertues: ſobrietie, chaſtitie and contentation: by which the appetite muſt be gouerned.
                  
                     Polan. part. theol. l. 2.
               
               
                  Sobrietie, is a continence from ſuperfluous meat and drinke▪
                   and from a wilfull macerating and afflicting of the body.Polan. ib.
               
               
                  Chaſtitie is a continencie from wandering luſts, and from all impuritie, both in wedlock, and out of it.
               
               Contentation is when a man is contented with his preſent eſtate▪ whether rich or poore, noble or inglorious.Col. 4.11.12. 
                  Paul ſaith, I haue learned in whatſoeuer ſtate I am, therewith to be content. I can bee abaſhed, and I can abound: euery where in all things I am inſtructed, both to be full, and to be hungrie, and to abound, and to haue want.
               
               Laſtly, the ſactification of the ſoule conſiſts in a Chriſtian reſolution, and conſtant indeauour with al our forces to pleaſe God, and to teſtifie our loue vnto him in the ſeruing of our neighbour▪ and ſeeking our owne ſaluation: and withall flatly denying of

our ſelues:Perk. ib. 
                  Which is, firſt, when we hold God to be wiſer then vve are, that ſo wee ſhould bee both directed, and diſpoſed of by him. Secondly, when vvee account him more carefull for vs, then we our ſelues can be, and ſo reſt vvell ſatisfied vvith vvhat condition of life ſoeuer he ſets vs in.
               
               The Sanctification of the body is that, wherby the members thereof are made fit inſtruments for the ſoule regenerated to worke the workes of God with; it being become obedient to the minde illumined and the heart reformed, through the worke of the Spirit, who now hath made it the Temple of his holineſſe, whereas before it was a ſlaue to the fleſh,1. Cor. 6.19 and a ſhop of iniquitie and vncleanneſſe.
               The Sanctification of the life is a viſible reformation of it, when as it is dedicated to God and good duties, thoſe ſinnes being abandoned, which reigned in it in former times. And ſo much for the Subiects of Sanctification
                     •
                   where remember that this worke of the Spirit is wrought in the whole

man: and that it belongs onely to the faithfull and Elect of God. Ciuill moralities, outward formalities, and ſuch graces, as doe onely bridle and repreſſe ſinne, may befall the reprobate: but Chriſtian vertues, and ſuch graces, as doe ſupplant and ſuppreſſe ſinne in our ſoules, ſuch works of the Spirit▪ as doe reuiue and reſtore Gods image, are appropriated to beleeuers.
               The time wherein Sanctification is wrought, is in this life; in ſome ſooner, in others later, but in none after this life, if wee reſpect the beginning of it, and not the finiſhing. For it is begunne euer before death, and neuer after. He that would be ſaued in the life to come, muſt bee ſanctified in this life. None liue like victorious Princes in the Church triumphant, but ſuch as haue bene courageous ſoldiours in the Church militant.
               The properties of Sanctification are many.
               Firſt, it is a moſt gracious and free worke of the Lord, without all obligation or merit of ours. For the

Spirit of God bloweth with his blaſts of grace both when,Ephe. 2.4.8 how and where he liſteth. And the Apoſtle teacheth vs that our quickning and ſaluation, is through the great loue and grace of God.
                  
                     Lib. 2. de praedeſt. ſan. cap. 15. 
                  It is not giuen vs (ſaith Auguſtine) for any merit (to wit of ours) that we are borne againe of vvater and of the Spirit: but it is freelie giuen: and if faith haue brought vs to the lauer of regeneration, we muſt not therfore think that we gaue ſomthing before, that ſauing regeneration might be giuē as in the vvay of recōpence.
               
               Secondly, this new birth is ſo needfull, as that without it we cannot bee ſaued. The kingdome of grace is the ſuburbs of the kingdome of glorie: he therefore, that walkes not through the ſuburbs, ſhall neuer enter into the Citie: a man muſt be in the kingdom of grace, or elſe he ſhall neuer be admitted into the kingdome of glorie: no grace, no glory: no holineſſe, no happineſſe, no heauen, no heauenly honour.Ioh. 3.3. 
                  Except a man bee borne againe,
                  
                     Lib. 1. ad Simplic. q. 2. 
                  hee cannot ſee the kingdome of God, neither in this world nor in the

world to come. There are (ſaith Auguſtine) certaine beginnings of faith, like vnto conceptions: but yet, that a man may come to eternall life, it is not onely needfull that he be conceiued, but that he bee alſo borne.
               
               Thirdly, Sanctification is an vnreſiſtable act of the Spirit. For when the holy Ghoſt doth ſeriouſly intend to ſanctifie a man, hee doth ſo worke vpon him, that hee ſhall willingly yeeld, how vnwillingly ſo euer his will be by nature.
                     Aug. 16. 
                  On vvhom God ſhevveth mercie (ſaith that learned Father) he doth ſo call him, as hee knovveth conuenient for him, that hee may not reiect him, vvhich calleth to him. The ſame may be ſaid concerning ſanctificatiō.
               Fourthly, our Regeneration is but once begun, howſoeuer our holineſſe ſometimes increaſeth, and ſometimes decreaſeth.
               The Scripture ſpeaketh but of one new birth.
                     Tract. in Ioh. 11. c. 12. 
                  As there is (ſaith Auſten) one fleſhlie generation, neither can there be made a returne into the vvombe: ſo is there one ſpirituall regeneration. Semel

enim naſcimur, ſemel quo
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      renaſcimur, We are once borne, and we are once born anew. We are but once brought forth by our naturall mother, once begotten by our naturall father: ſo wee are but once begotten of our heauēly father, and but once brought foorth and borne of our ſpirituall mother, which is the Church.
               Fiftly, Sanctification is an infallible argument of eternall ſaluation. Grace is the teſtification of glorie: and glory is the promiſed compenſation of grace.1. Tim 4.8.
               
               
                  Godlineſſe hath the promiſe of this life, and of that vvhich is to come.Greenhā. When vve haue receiued mortification and ſanctification is hanſels of Gods mercies, thē may vvee hope for heauen: for they that haue receiued grace, ſhall alſo receiue glorie. And as we haue behaued our ſelues in the kingdom of grace in this world, ſo it ſhalbe done vnto vs in the kingdom of glorie in the world to come. Holineſſe is a ſigne of honor: and the more we haue of holineſſe, the more wee ſhall haue of honour.
               
                  Sixtly, ſanctificatiō is a very excellent & commodious worke of God. Firſt becauſe it is wrought by his own finger, & by his own hand engrauen vpon the tables of our harts.
                     Perk. on Gal. 5.3. Secondly that it is a Reformation and change according to the vvhole law of God, and containes in it the ſeeds of all good duties. Thirdly, becauſe without it our life is moſt vile and deſpicable, wholly corrupt and ſinfull. For (as Auguſtine ſaith) hovv can hee liue iustly,
                  
                     Lib, 1. ad Simp. q 2. 
                  that is not iustified? Hovv can he liue holily, vvho is not ſanctified? Or hovv can hee liue at all, who is not raiſed vp to life?
               
               Seauently, Sanctification is in this life imperfect. Sinne is not all at once conſumed: but the ſcum thereof is almoſt continually boiling and walloping in vs, foming out much filthy froth and ſtinking ſauours. If vve ſay (ſaith Iohn) that vve haue no ſinne,
                  1. Ioh. 1.8. 
                  vvee deceiue our ſelues, and trueth is not in vs.

as he is burthened with the garment of his fleſh. Death muſt end the conflict betwixt the fleſh and the ſpirit. So long as we liue ſinne will not die. I

                  there muſt bee a diſſolution of nature. The body muſt firſt rot before grace ſhall raigne without diſturbance. It is true indeed, that the corruption of our nature is aboliſhed in Baptiſme in reſpect of guilt and condemnation, but not in regard of exiſtence. Concupiſcence (ſaith Ambroſe) is taken avvay in Baptiſme (Non vt non ſit, ſed ne obſit) Not as touching the being of it, but in that it ſhall bee no impediment of ſaluation to them, that are baptiſed with water and the holy Ghoſt. For it is to ſuch no Prince, but a Rebell only: it neither ſhall damne them, nor dominere within them.M. Greenh. 
                  But as a Serpent cut in diuerſe peeces hath but certaine reliques of poiſon, and remnants of fiercenes in the maimed members & mangled parts thereof, and is not able to exerciſe the like violence to a man, as when it was whole

and perfitlie membred: ſo howſoeuer ſ

               And although thoſe that are regenerated may bee termed iuſt and perfit, yet it is onely in compariſon of the wicked, who are in bondage vnder ſinne, & reſpect of Imputatiue righteouſneſſe: and for that they are perfect becauſe (like Infants) they haue all the parts of a Chriſtian▪ and not the perfection of thoſe parts. All the ſeeds of ſauing graces are ſowen in their harts, but they haue not the

                     : if a part of his corruption be taken avvay, and a proportionall part of holineſſe put inſtead of it, the vvhole man becomes partly holie, partly vnholie. And albeit holineſſe and ſin be contrary, yet may they be both in one ſubiect as light and darknes in the aire at the twilight, beeing there remiſ

Secondly that deſpiſing this world, we might the more affect our heauenly life, as knowing that our perfect ſanctification ſhall not bee wrought till wee come into heauen.Vrſine.

our ſpirituall wiſedome and Chriſtian fortitude and magnanimity, in defeating the wiles of ſin and the plots of the Diuell,Reuel. 1.6. and in contending (like couragious Kings) againſt all our ſpirituall aduerſaries, and finally in diſdaining to giue place to the fleſh, that abominable and filthy wretch.
               Fifthly, the Lord doth hereby demonſtrate his liberty and abſolute authoritie ouer vs, that he is not bound vnto vs by any bond of duetie to perfit his graces in vs in this life. For then it ſhould be iniuſtice in him not to do it.Pſal. 145.17. But God is righteous in all his waies, and holy in all his vvorkes, and can not offer the leaſt iniuſtice.
               Sixthly God thus doth to manifeſt his mercie to vs, & to teach vs thankfulneſſe to him, who pardoneth our weake obedience, and accepteth of our poore holineſſe & imperfect perfection.
               There are with God two courts of Iuſtice.M. Greenh. Ius cenſoriū
                     ▪

                        •
                     . The firſt is the Kings bench, where there is ſtrict iuſtice: the other is the Chancerie, where there is a mitigation

of that ſtrict courſe of Iuſtice. In the firſt Court there is none found iuſt: in the ſecond court of acceptation ſome are accepted for iuſt men. In this Court God accepteth our vnperfit holines, our poore indeauours, our weake reſolutions, our imperfect deſires, motions and meditations, if they be faithfull, and entire, and directed to the right ends; and for his Chriſt doth pardon all their defects. Which argueth mercie on his part, & claimeth gratitude on ours.
               Laſtly the Lord thus doth to demonſtrate his prouidence and power in protecting and conſeruing vs againſt ſo many puiſlant & pernicious enemies, as we are begirt with; notwithſtanding our great vnworthines, weakneſſes and imperfections. And ſo much for the ſeuenth property of Sanctification.
               Eightly, this worke of the Spirit is neuer cleane extinguiſhed. The gifts of God are without repentance.Rom. 11.29 
                  The graces of God are not in his children as morning miſts,
                  Greenh.

to continue all aſſaults.
                  Phil. 1.6. As he hath begū the worke of ſanctification, ſo he will make an end of it. For what ſhould hinder? His good will is conſtant, & his might is ouer all. Sin, Sathan and all the enemies of our ſoules whatſoeuer are with him as chaffe before a whirlewinde▪ or as flax before a flame of fire. His eie is waking and allſeing, his wiſedome is infinite, his eſſence euery where, and his mercie endureth for euer. What then can, what ſhall hinder his worke? He hath ioyned vs to Chriſt,Hoſ. 2.19. who ſhall diſioyne vs? He hath wedded vs vnto himſe
                     •
                  fe, what can diuorce vs? He is with vs, who can be againſt vs? Chriſt is our King, and we are his ſubiects, we neede not therefore doubt of his fauour and protection. He iſ our Architect, hee hath built vs vpon a rocke,Mat. 16.18 and hath ſaid that hell gates ſhall not preuaile againſt vs.1. Cor. 6.1 9. Wee are the Temples of Gods ſpirit, who is no idle, nor regard leſſe Inhabitant. Our holineſſe (I confeſſe) may ſuffer an eclipſe and be diminiſhed, but it ſhall neuer be fully

waſted and aboliſhed.

It is our Fathers good pleaſure to giue vs the kingdome of heauen, and therefore we ſhall not miſſe it. It remaineth thē as an vndoubted trueth that the work of ſanctification ſhall neuer be demoliſhed,

Maſter Bradford ſaith well, Our blindnes and corrupt affections doe often ſhadovv the ſight of Gods ſeede in Gods children, as thogh they were plain Reprobates: Whereof it commeth that they praying according to their ſenſe, but not according to the truth, deſire of God to giue them againe his Spirit, as though they had lost it, and he had taken it away: which thing God neuer doth indeede, although he make vs to thinke ſo for a time. And ſo much for this eight property.
               Ninthly, ſanctification may be diſcerned.1. Cor. 3.16. The childe of God may be ſure of his new birth. The Apoſtle ſaith, know ye not that ye are the Temple

                  Fiftly, He that is begotten of GOD,
                  1. Ioh. 5.18. 
                  keepeth himſelfe, and that wicked one toucheth him not.

                  ds himſelfe with the armour of God, and is fearefull to offend him, he doth giue an vndoubted teſtimonie of ſauing grace within him.
               Sixtly, when a man will rather forſake the world, then God, hee doth plainely ſhew that hee is not of the world, but belongs to God, and to his kingdome.
               Seuenthly, to grieue for ſin becauſe it offends God, and hurts his owne ſoule, is a notable ſigne of a mortified heart.
               Eightly, a ſanctified man doth manifeſt the grace of his heart by ſanctifying the name of God, and by conuerſing with ſanctified men, as alſo by ſeeking the ſanctification of others. For (bonum eſt ſui diffuſiuum) a good man doth loue to communicate his goodnes, and not to keepe it lockt vp

in his owne breaſt.

               Thirdly they agree in their ſcope and end. For they both 
                        〈◊〉
                      tend to one end: 
                        〈◊〉
                      iuſtification, as the cauſe: and ſanctification, as the way.
               
               Now as they doe accord in ſome things, ſo they diſcord againe in other:

& their difference may appeare in theſe things enſuing.
               Firſt,
                     M. Perk. on. Iude. 1. in that iuſtification is out of a man; ſanctification is within him.
               Secondly, iuſtification abſolueth a ſinner, and makes him ſtand righteous at the barre of Gods iudgement; ſanctification cannot do this.
               Thirdly iuſtification brings peace of conſcience; ſo doth not ſanctification, but followeth that peace. Hac ille.
               
               Fourthly, iuſtification conſiſts in the imputation of righteouſnes; ſanctification in the infuſion of righteouſnes.
               Fiftly iuſtification is acted at once, ſanctification is done by degrees: holineſſe is not made vp at once like a pellet in a mould, but ſucceſſiuelie, & at leiſure. Wee are neither perfect men, nor perfect new men in our full dimenſions, ſo ſoone as we are borne. Our perfection in this life conſiſteth rather in the pardon of ſin, then in the perfection of ſanctity. But iuſtification in this life is perfect.
               
                  Sixtly they differ in reſpect of the maner in which they are wrought. For iuſtification is wrought by the right of donation:
                  
                     Trele▪ Inſtit. lib. 2. 
                  but ſanctification is by the way of alteration.
               
               Laſtly they differ in regard of durance. For Iuſtification ſhall haue an end with this life; but ſanctification ſhall continue for euer.
