               FOraſmuch as it can not be but daungerous to the Queenes moſt excellent Maieſtie, and her court nowe reſidyng in the Caſtel of Windſor, yf any common reſort ſhould be ſuffred from or to the Citie of London, or the Suburbes of the ſame, where (by Gods ſufferaunce) many places are infected with the plague: Therfore her Maieſtie willeth and ſtraightly commaundeth that no maner of perſons ſhall come from the ſaid Citie or Suburbes to Windſor, or to the Towne of Eton, or ſhall cauſe to be brought any apparel, ſtuffe, or wares frō thence directly or indirectly, mediatly or immediatly: neither that any perſon attendant or folowing her Maieſties Court ordinaryly or extraordinaryly, or dwelling or any wiſe belonging to the Townes of Windſor or Eton or any part therof, ſhall repayre by land or by water to London or the Suburbes of the ſame, or to any pariſh neare London where any perſons haue ben knowen to haue ben lately ſicke of the plague, with any intent to returne agayne from thence within one moneth, otherwiſe then is hereafter ſpecially mentioned & prouided, vpon payne to be impriſoned without bayle for the ſame by the ſpace of one moneth: or (if the qualitie of the partie ſhall ſo require to be alſo whipped & puniſhed like a common vacabonde. And becauſe it can not preſently be ſo prouided for, but that ſome perſons ſhall of very neceſſitie haue cauſe to come from the ſayd Citie or Suburbes to the Court or to the Townes of Windſor & Eton, & likewiſe ſome others to repayre to ſome partes of the ſaid Citie or Suburbes not beyng infected: it is by her Maieſtie thus prouided, That if any ſhall haue any ſuch neceſſary cauſe to come from the Citie of London or Suburbes to the Court, the ſame perſon ſhal not enter into any maner houſe in Windſor or Eton, nor ſhall come within the vtter gates of the Court, vntyl he hath firſt reſorted to the Maior of Windſor, or to the principal officers in Eton, & to him or them declared to whom he hath neceſſary cauſe to repayre in the Court. And thervpon the ſaid Maior or officers ſhal cauſe the partie to ſtay abrode without entring into any houſe or company of any perſon, and ſhall certifie the lorde Stewarde, the lorde Chamberlaine, the Uizechamberlayne, or one of them, or ſome of the principal officers of the Greenecloth (if the matter appertayne to the Queenes Maieſties houſholde) or to ſome other of the lordes or others of her Maieſties priuie counſell, according to the qualitie of the matter, and of the perſons with whom the partie hath to do in the Court. And by a warrant in writing ſigned with the handes of any of the ſayd lordes, counſellers, or officers, certified to the ſayde Maior or officers, the ſayd perſon ſhalbe permitted to enter into ſome houſe, and afterwarde ſhall or may come to the Court with the ſayde warrant to be firſt ſhewed to the Queenes Maieſties Porters, or otherwiſe without ſuche warrant and allowaunce the ſayde perſon ſhalbe commaunded to returne without any lenger abyding, vpon payne aboue mentioned. And if the cauſe of the comming of the ſayde perſons to the Towne, ſhalbe for any matter belonging to any inhabitaunt of the Towne: in ſuch caſe the ſayde Maior and officers ſhall not in like maner ſuffer any ſuch perſon to come into any houſe, nor to bryng any ſtuffe vntyll the name of the partie and his cauſe be declared by the ſayde Maior or officers to the Conſtable of the Caſtell of Windſor, or to his Leefetenaunt, or to ſome of her Maieſties priuie counſell, or to the knight Marſhall, or cheefe Porter of the Caſtell, and by them or ſome of them allowed by warrant in wrytyng, without which order and ſuch allowaunce, no perſon ſhalbe ſuffred to remayne in any of the ſayde Townes, but ſhall returne immediatly. And if any perſon ſhall haue neceſſary cauſe to depart from the ſayde Townes or Court by land or by water to London or the Suburbes, with any minde to returne within one moneth, the ſame ſhall ſue to haue, and ſhall firſt obtayne ſpeciall licence and warrant in writing for euery tyme of his departure fromſome of the foreſayde principall officers of her Maieſties houſe, chamber, or ſome of her priuie counſell aboue mentioned: or els if the partie belong to the ſayde Townes, then from the ſayd Maior of Windſor, or the head officers of Eton: ſo as alſo the ſame perſons haue the conſent in writing of ſome of the officers and miniſters aboue mentioned.

And for the better execution hereof, her Maieſtie willeth and requireth all the foreſayde officers and miniſters aboue mencioned to conferre together, and to inſtruct the ſayd Maior of Windſor and officers of Eton, how and by what maner and fourme of warrantes (without fraude or couen) ſuch only as haue neceſſarie cauſes belonging to the Queenes Maieſtie, her lordes, counſellers, and others attending on her perſon or on her court, may be permitted to come from London or reſort thither, and no other: vſing therein all circumſpection conuenient and neceſſarie for ſuch a cauſe of importaunce.

For the ſpeedy occaſion wherof to be geuen by the ceaſſyng of the plague, Almightie God is to be with dayly prayers called vpon.
