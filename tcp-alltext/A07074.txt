which some may wittily accuse me; but my defence shall be as honest,
as many reproofes vnto me have beene most malicious. Since (I hartily
protest) it was my care to write so farre from reasonable offence,
that even strangers, in whose state I laid my Scene, should not from
thence draw any disgrace to any, dead or living. Yet in dispight of my indevors,
I vnderstand, some have beene most vnadvisedly over-cunning
in mis-interpreting me, and with subtilitie (as deepe as hell) have
maliciously spreadill rumors, which springing from themselves, might
to themselves have heavily returned. Surely I desire to satisfie every
firme spirit▪ who in all his actions, proposeth to himselfe no more ends
then God and vertue do, whose intentions are alwaies simple: to such
I protest, that with my free vnderstanding, I have not glanced at disgrace
of any, but of those, whose vnquiet studies labor innovation, contempt

spoken, should be inforcively published to be read, and that the least
hurt I can receive, is to do my selfe the wrong. But since others otherwise
would doe me more, the least inconvenience is to be accepted. I
have my selfe therefore set forth this Comedie; but so, that my inforced
absence must much relye vpon the Printers discretion: but I shall
intreate, slight errors in orthographie may bee as slightly over passed;
and that the vnhansome shape which this trifle in reading presents,
may be pardoned, for the pleasure it once afforded you, when it was
presented with the soule of lively action.

            Written by Iohn Webster.
            Enter W. Sly, a Tyre-man following him with a stoole.
            
               Tyer-man.
               
                  SIR, the Gentlemen will be angry if you
sit heare.
            
            
               Sly
               Why? we may sit vpon the stage
at the private house: thou doest not take
me for a country gentleman, doest? doest
thinke I feare hissing? Ile holde my life
thou took'st me for one of the plaiers.
            
            
               Tyre:
               No sir.
            
            
               Sly
               By gods slid if you had, I would have given you but six
pence for your stoole: Let them that have stale suites, sit in the
galleries, hisse at mee: he that will be laught out of a Taverne
or an Ordinarie, shall seldome feede well or be drunke in good
company. Where's Harry Cundale, D: Burbidge, and W: Sly,
let me speake with some of them.
            
            
               Tyre:
               An't please you to go in sir, you may.
            
            
               Sly:
               
                  I tell you no; I am one that hath seene this play often, & can
give them intellegence for their action: I have most of the ieasts
heere in my table-booke.
            
            
               
Enter Sinkclow.
            
               Sink:
               Save you Coose.
            
            
               Sly:
               O Coosin, come you shall sit betweene my legges heare.
            
            
               Sink:
               No indeede coosin, the audience then will take me for
a viol de gambo, and thinke that you play vpon me.

               Nay,

               Sink:
               We staied for you at supper last night at my coosin Hony-moones
the woollen Draper: After supper we drew cuttes
for a score of Apricoks, the longest cut stil to draw an Apricoke:
by this light t'was Mistris Franke Hony-moones fortune, still to
have the longest cut: I did measure for the women. What be these
coose?
            
            Enter D: Burbidge, H: Cundale, I: Lewin.
            
               Sly:
               The Plaiers. God save you.
            
            
               Bur:
               You are verie welcome.

                  I pray you know this Gentleman my coosin, t'is Master
Doomesdaies sonne the vserer.
            
            
               Cun:
               I beseech you sir be coverd.
            
            
               Sly:
               No in good faith for mine ease, looke you my hat's the
handle to this fanne: Gods so, what a beast was I, I did not leave
my father at home. Well, but Ile take an order with you.
            
            Puts his feather in his pocket.
            
               Bur:
               Why do you conceale your feather sir?
            
            
               Sly:
               Why? do you thinke Ile have ieasts broken vpon me in
the play to be laught at: this play hath beaten all your gallants out
of the feathers: Blacke friars hath almost spoild blacke friars
for feathers.
            
            
               Sink:
               Gods so, I thought t'was for somewhat our gentlewomen
at home counseld me to weare my feather to the play, yet I
am loth to spoile it.
            
            
               Sly:
               Why coose?
            
            
               Sink:
               Because I got it in the tilt-yard: there was a Harralde
broke my pate for taking it vp: but I have worne it vp & downe
the strand, and met him fortie times since, and yet hee dares not
challenge it.
            
            
               Sly:
               Do you heare sir, this play is a bitter play.
            
            
               Cun:
               Why sir, tis neither Satyre nor Morall, but the meane
passage of a historie: Yet there are a sort of discontented
creatures that beare a stingeles
                     •
                  e envie to great ones, and these

will wrest the doings of any man to their base malitious appliment:
but should their interpretation come to the teste, like your
marmasite, they presently turne their teeth to their taile & eate it.
            
            
               Sly:
               I will not go so farre with you, but I say, any man that
hath wit, may censure (if he sit in the twelve-penny roome:) and
I say againe, the play is bitter.
            
            
               Bur:
               Sir you are like a Patron that presenting a poore scholler
to a benefice, inioynes him not to raile against any thing that
standes within compasse of his Patrons follie: Why should not
we inioy the antient freedome of poesie? Shall we protest to the
Ladies that their painting makes them Angells, or to my yong
gallant, that his expence in the brothell shall gaine him reputation?
No sir, such vices as stand not accountable to law, should be
cured as men heale tetters, by casting inke vpon them. Would
you be satisfied in any thing else sir?
            
            
               Sly:
               I marry woud I.
               I would know how you came by this play?
            
            
               Cun:
               Faith sir the booke was lost, a
                     •
                  d because twas pittie so
good a play should be lost, we found it and play it.
            
            
               Sly:
               I wonder you would play it, another company having
interest in it?
            
            
               Cun:
               Why not Maleuole in folio with vs, as Ieronimo in Decimo
sexto with them. They taught vs a name for our play, wee
call it One for another.
               
            
            
               Sly:
               What are your additions?
            
            
               Bur:
               Sooth not greatly needefull, only as your sallet to your
greate feast, to entertaine a little more time, and to abridge the
not received custome of musicke in our Theater. I must leave
you sir.
               Exit Burbidge.
            
            
               Sink:
               Doth he play the Malecontent?

               Yes sir.

               I durst lay foure of mine eares, the play is not so well
acted as it hath beene.

               I have an excellent thought: if some fiftie of the Grecians
that were cramd in the horse belly had eaten garlike, do you not
thinke the Troians might have smelt out their knavery.

discontent then Lucifer when he was thrust out of the presence,
his appetite is vnsatiable as the Grave; as farre from any content,
as from heauen: his highest delight is to procure others vexation,
and therein he thinkes he truly serues heauen; for t'is his position,
whosoeuer in this earth can bee contented, is a flaue and
damn'd; therefore do's he afflict al in that to which they are most
affected; th' Elements struggle within him; his own soule is at variance
within her selfe: his speach is halter-worthy at all houres:
I like him; faith, he giues good intelligence to my spirit, makes
me vnderstand those weakenesses which others flattery palliates:

man to be in a Princes fauour: O sweete God! O pleasure! O
fortune! O all thou best of life! what should I thinke: what say?
what do? to be a fauorite? a minion? to haue a generall timerous
respect, obserue a man, a statefull silence in his presence, solitarinesse
in his absence, a confused hum, and busie murmure of obsequious
suters training him; the cloth held vp, and way proclaimed
before him: Petitionary vassalls licking the pauement

with their slauish knees, whilst some odde pallace Lampreel

happier then a God that loues you, or is beloued by you; you
preseruers of mankinde, life blood of society, who would liue,
nay who can liue without you? O Paradice, how maiesticall is
your austerer presence? how imperiously chaste is your more
modest face? but O! how full of rauishing attraction is your prettie,
petulant, langushing, laciuiously-composed countenance:
these amorous smiles, those soule-warming sparkling glances, ardent
as those flames that sing'd the world by heedelesse Phaeton;
in body how delicate, in soule how wittie, in discourse how pregnant,
in life how warie, in fauours how iuditious, in day how sociable,
and in night how? O pleasure vnutterable, indeede it is most
certaine, one man cannot deserue onely to inioy a beauteous woman:

mistrisses in dissembling, only constant in vnconstancie,
onely perfect in counterfaiting: their wordes are fained, their eyes
forged, their sights dissembled, their lookes counterfait, their
haire false, their giuen hopes deceitfull, their very breath artificiall▪

O beauties, looke to your buske-pointes, if not chastely, yet charily:

fidelitie, were his nose narrower, his eyes broader, his hands thinner,
his lippes thicker, his legges bigger, his feete lesser, his haire
blacker, and his teeth whiter, he were a tollerable sweete youth
yfaith. And he will come to my chamber, I will reade him the
fortune of his beard.
